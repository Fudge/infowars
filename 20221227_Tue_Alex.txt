[00:00.000 --> 00:19.240]  Let's first go back to this Great Mike Adams article that came out in July of last year
[00:19.240 --> 00:24.680]  and it links right to the New England Medical Journal that hides it deep in the study that's
[00:24.680 --> 00:28.520]  an 82% of pregnant women who got vaccinated for COVID during the first and second trial
[00:28.520 --> 00:32.840]  measures suffered miscarriages and it's still a very, very large amount as well you can
[00:32.840 --> 00:37.160]  read in the third trimester as well.
[00:37.160 --> 00:40.600]  That's also in the double digits.
[00:40.600 --> 00:45.880]  Here's one of the studies, preliminary findings of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine safety in pregnant
[00:45.880 --> 00:46.880]  women.
[00:46.880 --> 00:50.800]  Miscarriage, stillbirth rates exploding worldwide as depopulation continues and abated.
[00:50.800 --> 00:55.320]  You can see the graph there from the federal government's own numbers, similar numbers around
[00:55.320 --> 00:56.320]  the world.
[00:56.320 --> 01:00.920]  Exposure to COVID vaccine spike protein renders women infertile, nurse whistleblower, fetal
[01:00.920 --> 01:05.480]  deaths of skyrocketed since pregnant women started using, being forced to get COVID-19
[01:05.480 --> 01:06.480]  shots.
[01:06.480 --> 01:10.720]  Australia sees 63% drop in birth after introduction of COVID vaccines.
[01:10.720 --> 01:13.320]  What will the government's excuse will be?
[01:13.320 --> 01:14.320]  Hospital president.
[01:14.320 --> 01:18.560]  COVID-19 vaccines causing miscarriages is complete myth, plain and simple.
[01:18.560 --> 01:23.520]  I'm very happy to report that among the tens of thousands of women who have been closely
[01:23.520 --> 01:29.160]  studied after they chose to get the COVID-19 vaccines, the data is clear these vaccines
[01:29.160 --> 01:30.320]  are safe.
[01:30.320 --> 01:37.320]  The often mentioned but completely unsubstantiated concerns about COVID-19 vaccines causing either
[01:37.320 --> 01:43.200]  miscarriages or other problems with their pregnancy or causing problems getting pregnant
[01:43.200 --> 01:46.600]  is a complete myth, plain and simple.
[01:46.600 --> 01:47.600]  Where's the study?
[01:47.600 --> 01:48.600]  The tens of thousands of women.
[01:48.600 --> 01:49.600]  Where is it?
[01:49.600 --> 01:50.600]  They admit it's all lies.
[01:50.600 --> 01:51.760]  Pfizer fake reports as well.
[01:51.760 --> 01:53.520]  This guy is a lying scumbag.
[01:53.520 --> 01:56.720]  So he doesn't give any facts, doesn't give any statistics, doesn't give any numbers.
[01:56.720 --> 01:59.920]  He just says we have thousands of women and none of them had a problem.
[01:59.920 --> 02:00.920]  No, no, no.
[02:00.920 --> 02:03.400]  There's nobody, nobody's dying.
[02:03.400 --> 02:04.400]  No children are dying.
[02:04.400 --> 02:10.440]  I've been actively miscarrying since the 8th and I have gone to a doctor and this is my
[02:10.440 --> 02:12.440]  second visit to ER.
[02:12.440 --> 02:19.560]  If you're wondering why women's rights matter, this is where nobody actually has come down.
[02:19.560 --> 02:23.280]  They're always going to set me up.
[02:23.280 --> 02:25.560]  These are the folks that tell you that two men can have a baby.
[02:25.560 --> 02:27.560]  It's all upside down world.
[02:27.560 --> 02:31.480]  You know, they use DNA to prove somebody committed a murder 30 years ago and that's all scientific.
[02:31.480 --> 02:37.880]  But now the science guy, Bill Nye's new shows tell kids that there are no X and Y chromosomes.
[02:37.880 --> 02:39.200]  They're murdering the truth.
[02:39.200 --> 02:40.840]  They're murdering science.
[02:40.840 --> 02:46.480]  And he sits up there and says out of tens of thousands of women, nobody's had a miscarriage.
[02:46.480 --> 02:48.240]  Nobody's had a sick baby.
[02:48.240 --> 02:49.400]  That's a damn lie.
[02:49.400 --> 02:53.360]  I see a vast number of patients a year.
[02:53.360 --> 02:59.520]  I don't know of any other maternal field medicine physician in this country that sees as many
[02:59.520 --> 03:02.360]  patients as I do by ultrasound.
[03:02.360 --> 03:08.960]  At one point in time this year I was on track to see 9,000, 9,000 high risk OB ultrasounds.
[03:08.960 --> 03:15.560]  So I know what's going on and I've seen death and destruction like I've never seen before.
[03:15.560 --> 03:20.600]  The stillbirth rate is measured in terms of live births per thousand.
[03:20.600 --> 03:27.400]  And really it's come down in my career from about 10 to about almost 5.8 or 6.
[03:27.400 --> 03:33.800]  Now let's go to 2021 and look at the stillbirth rate for Michele's.
[03:33.800 --> 03:35.400]  This is horrifying.
[03:35.400 --> 03:44.680]  But if you take this death figure and you look at that rate at 29.3, that's sigma that
[03:44.680 --> 03:53.560]  you're looking at is 40 plus sigma, standard deviation.
[03:53.560 --> 03:55.680]  Let that sink in.
[03:55.680 --> 04:03.200]  And what I've seen in my clinical practice has been a substantial massive increase unprecedented
[04:03.200 --> 04:12.200]  in menstrual abnormalities prior to pregnancy, a substantial increase in infertility, a substantial
[04:12.200 --> 04:18.680]  increase in miscarriage, fetal death and fetal malformation.
[04:18.680 --> 04:22.880]  Published many studies this year over the last two years.
[04:22.880 --> 04:32.520]  Our latest study which we've used from VAERS and CDC data and we compared the COVID-19 vaccines
[04:32.520 --> 04:39.000]  over the last 15, 18 months with those of the influenza vaccine and pregnancy.
[04:39.000 --> 04:42.360]  And what we've seen is catastrophic.
[04:42.360 --> 04:45.000]  What did Alexander Sulton Eatson say about this?
[04:45.000 --> 04:48.320]  He goes, we know they are lying.
[04:48.320 --> 04:50.880]  They know they are lying.
[04:50.880 --> 04:53.200]  They know we know they are lying.
[04:53.200 --> 05:01.360]  We know they know we know they are lying, but they are still lying.
[05:01.360 --> 05:06.040]  I've taken a lot of supplements over the years since high school and they had great effects.
[05:06.040 --> 05:09.720]  And the science has got better and better and better over the years.
[05:09.720 --> 05:14.520]  And now with all the things we're bombarded with and the water and the food and the feminizing
[05:14.520 --> 05:18.960]  factors, it is more important than ever to use the compounds God gave us to boost our
[05:18.960 --> 05:19.960]  natural male potential.
[05:19.960 --> 05:22.520]  But these products work great for women as well.
[05:22.520 --> 05:26.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have Pain MD, it's the number one natural best seller under
[05:26.480 --> 05:27.480]  another name.

[05:42.640 --> 05:43.640]  the day.

[06:00.040 --> 06:04.040]  Platinum.
[06:04.040 --> 06:16.360]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government coverups.
[06:16.360 --> 06:18.080]  You want to stop tyranny?
[06:18.080 --> 06:26.400]  Well so does he, live from the InfoWareStore.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:26.400 --> 06:32.360]  It's Tuesday, December 27th, the year is 2022, we're in the final, finalite of this incredible
[06:32.360 --> 06:34.480]  year.
[06:34.480 --> 06:39.280]  The year has been one of war, the year has been one of awakening, the year has been one
[06:39.280 --> 06:45.240]  of great tyranny, but also humanity fighting back.
[06:45.240 --> 06:53.040]  I rarely take off three full days, but I did take off Friday, Saturday and Sunday and of
[06:53.040 --> 06:58.680]  course still couldn't help myself to about five hours of study each day, but had time
[06:58.680 --> 07:03.520]  to pull back and really assess the situation of the world.
[07:03.520 --> 07:07.880]  And I'm going to try to present all of this news here that you see in front of me, every
[07:07.880 --> 07:14.480]  one of these articles I could spend the entire four hours on, so it's quite a task to cover
[07:14.480 --> 07:19.320]  the gravity of the situation, but here is the final equation.
[07:19.320 --> 07:25.760]  The decision has been made by the ruling elite of the planet to selfishly poison and dumb
[07:25.760 --> 07:33.120]  down and exterminate at least 90% of us, and they've gone from beta testing into operational
[07:33.120 --> 07:35.280]  mode.
[07:35.280 --> 07:39.200]  And as Elon Musk came out over the weekend and said, we have a video of it, we'll play
[07:39.200 --> 07:50.360]  just in a moment, name a conspiracy theory about Twitter that did not turn out to be
[07:50.360 --> 07:51.360]  true.
[07:51.360 --> 07:56.200]  Everybody's seen the meme, I've need new conspiracy theories, all the old ones came true.
[07:56.200 --> 08:03.800]  Well the truth is, we knew exactly what was going on at Twitter because it was in legislation
[08:03.800 --> 08:07.840]  that Obama signed before he left, I know I've harped on this.
[08:07.840 --> 08:12.480]  And the real reason I was banned off of Twitter finally, they said it was because I confronted
[08:12.480 --> 08:18.680]  Oliver Darcy at a congressional hearing outside, which I did, but it's what I said in that
[08:18.680 --> 08:26.320]  11 minute confrontation that's on banned on video that got me banned, not saying he had
[08:26.320 --> 08:28.400]  the eyes of a rat.
[08:28.400 --> 08:37.080]  I knew that CNN was quarterbacking with the Washington Post and the New York Times a liaison
[08:37.080 --> 08:40.080]  with the State Department, that's when Trump was in, it went back into the White House
[08:40.080 --> 08:45.640]  once Trump was gone, but right under Trump's nose, to bring in thousands of other news
[08:45.640 --> 08:50.560]  outlets and send them for Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL training in a month long
[08:50.560 --> 08:58.800]  course, they trained over, get ready for this, 300,000 people the last six years that they
[08:58.800 --> 09:06.560]  admit to in documents to then work inside Big Tech and inside the Justice Department
[09:06.560 --> 09:12.440]  where these NGOs then give the orders to the Justice Department and the orders to the newspapers
[09:12.440 --> 09:14.400]  and the orders to Big Tech.
[09:14.400 --> 09:21.480]  Just like two years ago, O Biden, when he stole the election, hired the former NGO head
[09:21.480 --> 09:25.880]  that opened up Europe in the last 12 years to the tens of millions of Islamists and others
[09:25.880 --> 09:32.080]  pouring in, they brought that very NGO over, they got a U.S. Charter and then it took over
[09:32.080 --> 09:41.240]  the giant illegal alien migrant centers, and as you know, tripled what Obama was bringing
[09:41.240 --> 09:48.800]  in and just absolutely have skyrocketed it since, so there's now a criminal investigation
[09:48.800 --> 09:55.520]  going on by the state of Texas of that because it's totally illegal, but when you go there,
[09:55.520 --> 10:04.160]  you see the NGOs, literally many of them with purple and green hair, in charge of the Border
[10:04.160 --> 10:12.160]  Patrol and the ICE personnel, so we know this all frontwards and backwards, we know every
[10:12.160 --> 10:18.280]  facet of it and the FBI now came out and Fox News reported, they said big deal, okay, yeah,
[10:18.280 --> 10:24.040]  it's gonna come out that we had people inside all of the Big Tech companies and thousands
[10:24.040 --> 10:28.600]  of other companies and are calling the shots for your own good, now just a week ago, the
[10:28.600 --> 10:33.840]  FBI put a press release out, the FBI director did, saying it's a conspiracy theory and none
[10:33.840 --> 10:38.120]  of it's true, and they had lots of articles saying fact check Elon Musk has published
[10:38.120 --> 10:43.800]  fake documents, bull face gas lighting didn't work, blew up in their face, so now they're
[10:43.800 --> 10:49.320]  like, yeah, of course we pay millions of dollars and put our personnel inside, but they are
[10:49.320 --> 10:58.080]  there with top national security clearances, top secret, not secret, top secret, and then
[10:58.080 --> 11:03.960]  they give all that top secret information to the NGOs, and so it goes back and forth,
[11:03.960 --> 11:09.880]  the NGOs create the policy, then the law enforcement, whether it's ICE or whether it's the FBI,
[11:09.880 --> 11:14.960]  whether it's Border Patrol or a federal marshal, they got a bunch of those in there, 60 plus
[11:14.960 --> 11:20.240]  thousand of them, inside running this, they're in your private messages, they're in your
[11:20.240 --> 11:27.600]  email if you use a big company, they're watching everything you do privately, it is a trillion
[11:27.600 --> 11:32.360]  times bigger, literally, they think Nixon did, Nixon spied on a few people and thought
[11:32.360 --> 11:39.180]  about having the IRS audit 123 people, that later came out, he never did it, when I say
[11:39.180 --> 11:43.880]  a trillion times bigger, I mean there are trillions of different actions on the web
[11:43.880 --> 11:49.280]  going on in the U.S. alone every day, and it's all being watched in live time, to suppress
[11:49.280 --> 11:54.240]  elections and to target, it now came out in the new Twitter files released on Saturday,
[11:54.240 --> 11:57.440]  what we already told you, I said they're not just coordinating the Hunter laptop, they're
[11:57.440 --> 12:01.980]  not just coordinating people questioning elections, they're not just censoring people
[12:01.980 --> 12:11.000]  questioning the war in Ukraine or the Afghan withdrawal, they are suppressing hundreds
[12:11.000 --> 12:19.320]  of thousands of doctors, nurses and scientists, including Nobel Prize winners, it's now come
[12:19.320 --> 12:24.360]  out and blocking them and censoring them and having them banned on Twitter, but we only
[12:24.360 --> 12:29.160]  know about the Twitter because Elon Musk is releasing it, so people two weeks ago, three
[12:29.160 --> 12:33.200]  weeks ago when the Starter said it was a nothing burger, Musk said no, it's huge, I'm going
[12:33.200 --> 12:40.480]  to release it in more than 50 pieces, they're up to what, number 15 now, of 50 pieces, this
[12:40.480 --> 12:48.280]  is already a mega five patty quadruple cheeseburger with chili and two fried eggs on it, this is
[12:48.280 --> 12:52.880]  the biggest hamburger I've ever seen, this is not a nothing burger, this is a burger
[12:52.880 --> 12:59.000]  four people couldn't eat, this is the mother of all burgers, the damn thing weighs 15
[12:59.000 --> 13:05.360]  pounds, if it was a burger, it's dripping with grease and onions, getting hungry, but
[13:05.360 --> 13:13.720]  to use the cheesy analogy, like literally, that's a pun, this is gargantuan, this is
[13:13.720 --> 13:22.800]  absolutely over the top and it's exactly precisely what I told you and when I confronted members
[13:22.800 --> 13:27.080]  of Congress and others about it and that's why I was banned because I scared the living
[13:27.080 --> 13:31.120]  hell out of them, you scared the living hell out of them with your support of this broadcast,
[13:31.120 --> 13:40.920]  that is just this stack of 15 articles or so, mega bombshell upon mega bombshell upon
[13:40.920 --> 13:46.960]  mega bombshell and I'm getting chills right now, every one of these stacks is mega bombshell,
[13:46.960 --> 13:52.080]  we're going to hit this one first when we come back and then we're going to plow into
[13:52.080 --> 13:56.560]  the climate lockdowns that are now officially being announced, not just overseas but here,
[13:56.560 --> 14:01.240]  computers in Buffalo, people freezing to death, now they're saying up to 80 dead, we're going
[14:01.240 --> 14:06.480]  to get to that, we have just got so much, so much to hit today and a special guest and
[14:06.480 --> 14:10.400]  calls, we're going to cover the waterfront, but first I mentioned it, here's Elon Musk
[14:10.400 --> 14:18.160]  over the weekend in an online interview, video interview, joking about how every conspiracy
[14:18.160 --> 14:23.440]  we heard about Twitter came true, yeah and it all came from info wars, 90% of it and
[14:23.440 --> 14:27.440]  I'm still banned, which I'm not begging to get back on your platform, he is freeing
[14:27.440 --> 14:31.440]  it up overall, compared to what it was this night and day, I understand I'm so demonized
[14:31.440 --> 14:35.640]  to back me, would be a bridge too far for him, he may not even be able to survive at
[14:35.640 --> 14:39.680]  Twitter or they're trying to take him down and I'm not saying he's a good guy either,
[14:39.680 --> 14:43.480]  I think he's trying to take over the new world order himself, but I'm just going to step
[14:43.480 --> 14:48.000]  out of the way and say go, go Musk because when it comes to the Twitter situation, he's
[14:48.000 --> 14:51.520]  doing a great job overall, let's be realistic about that but here's Musk.
[14:51.520 --> 14:58.760]  I mean to be totally frank, almost every conspiracy theory that people had about Twitter turned
[14:58.760 --> 15:07.160]  out to be true, so, is there a conspiracy theory about Twitter that didn't turn out
[15:07.160 --> 15:13.080]  to be true, so far they've all turned out to be true and if not, more true than people
[15:13.080 --> 15:14.080]  thought.
[15:14.080 --> 15:18.600]  Meanwhile, can we go back, is it that the owner of the warriors that's laughing with
[15:18.600 --> 15:25.640]  him, who, isn't that the owner of the warriors, who came out and said he doesn't care about
[15:25.640 --> 15:31.360]  three million Uyghur slaves, so there's just so many villains in all of this, so there's
[15:31.360 --> 15:36.040]  Musk giggling about conspiracy theories coming true with a guy that goes on TV and says,
[15:36.040 --> 15:41.360]  I don't care about three million slaves, they don't even enter my consciousness, they have
[15:41.360 --> 15:46.080]  no value, he didn't just say screw those people, he said they don't even exist, just
[15:46.080 --> 15:52.000]  a little side tidbit, tyranny, tyranny everywhere, we're going to come back with this stack
[15:52.000 --> 16:00.560]  and so much more straight ahead, infowars.com tomorrow's news today.
[16:00.560 --> 16:07.480]  Have you tried taking the real red pill, a one of a kind heart and brain formula designed
[16:07.480 --> 16:10.160]  exclusively for info wars life?
[16:10.160 --> 16:16.480]  The main ingredient in the real red pill plus is pregnanolone, a little known neuro steroid
[16:16.480 --> 16:22.160]  that assists in our body's natural hormone production and low levels are associated with
[16:22.160 --> 16:26.320]  fatigue, low brain function and unhealthy aging.
[16:26.320 --> 16:33.360]  The real red pill plus also provides essential trace minerals such as vitamin B12, calcium
[16:33.360 --> 16:40.120]  and zinc, featuring naturally occurring L-theanine, caffeine and theobromine, the energy blend
[16:40.120 --> 16:45.880]  inside the real red pill plus provides an extra pick me up for your day that goes beyond
[16:45.880 --> 16:47.640]  the second cup of coffee.
[16:47.640 --> 16:54.360]  So visit infowarsstore.com, go down the rabbit hole and try taking the real red pill to see
[16:54.360 --> 17:20.760]  what it's really all about, that's infowarsstore.com.

[18:12.880 --> 18:42.720]  next video, I hope you enjoyed it, I hope you enjoyed it, I'll see you in the next video,

[20:07.960 --> 20:34.960]  it, I'll see you in the next one.
[20:34.960 --> 20:43.240]  I mean, to be totally frank, um, almost every conspiracy theory that people had about Twitter
[20:43.240 --> 20:45.880]  turned out to be true.
[20:45.880 --> 20:53.320]  So is there a conspiracy theory about Twitter that didn't turn out to be true?
[20:53.320 --> 20:55.320]  So far, they've all turned out to be true.
[20:55.320 --> 20:59.120]  And if not, more true than people thought.
[20:59.120 --> 21:04.720]  And why is it must talking more about any big criticism of what he's doing at Twitter?
[21:04.720 --> 21:08.760]  Why isn't he talking about how the other big tech giants are on board with this and doing
[21:08.760 --> 21:14.640]  stuff even at a worse scale, larger scale?
[21:14.640 --> 21:15.640]  Think about that.
[21:15.640 --> 21:18.240]  Because what does it do if he frees up Twitter?
[21:18.240 --> 21:20.280]  But the others aren't free.
[21:20.280 --> 21:22.920]  Well, it makes everybody go to Twitter, which is what he wants.
[21:22.920 --> 21:27.520]  He's doing this because he'll dominate the market, which for whatever reason, you do
[21:27.520 --> 21:31.880]  the right thing, you do the right thing, but that's like a little right thing.
[21:31.880 --> 21:32.880]  That's a little R.
[21:32.880 --> 21:38.680]  Big R is free the whole system because you got eight kids must, are they in a limited
[21:38.680 --> 21:39.680]  free world?
[21:39.680 --> 21:44.200]  If we don't free the world, maybe you think your hundreds of billions will protect them.
[21:44.200 --> 21:45.800]  I think you're smart enough to know it won't.
[21:45.800 --> 21:49.760]  Only a free society will protect all of us.
[21:49.760 --> 21:54.440]  That's how it works and tyrants that get rid of freedom to have control always get bitten
[21:54.440 --> 21:56.400]  in the ass by the things they've done to others.
[21:56.400 --> 22:00.280]  So here's some of the headlines, FBI declines to list other social media companies that
[22:00.280 --> 22:01.280]  paid.
[22:01.280 --> 22:05.760]  It says the 3.5 million Twitter payment was a reimbursement.
[22:05.760 --> 22:09.080]  I guess those top secret security clearances were as well, but they're going to admit,
[22:09.080 --> 22:10.920]  yeah, we're paying off other people.
[22:10.920 --> 22:12.200]  We played the must clip.
[22:12.200 --> 22:15.640]  We totally Frank almost every conspiracy theory that people had about Twitter, but that'll
[22:15.640 --> 22:16.640]  be true.
[22:16.640 --> 22:22.800]  There's a good graphic going around Twitter that Robert W. Malone put out shows the Twitter
[22:22.800 --> 22:25.960]  files as the top of the iceberg and below the water.
[22:25.960 --> 22:32.160]  We've got 90% of what's still submerged Facebook files, Instagram files, WhatsApp files, Reddit
[22:32.160 --> 22:38.000]  files, TikTok files, Amazon files, Netflix files, Snapchat files, Google files, Microsoft
[22:38.000 --> 22:40.920]  files, YouTube files.
[22:40.920 --> 22:48.360]  But even bigger than that is the ADL, ADL files and the Southern priority law center
[22:48.360 --> 22:54.960]  files and the German intelligence files and the CIA files and the big bank files and the
[22:54.960 --> 23:01.080]  Goldman Sachs files and the Chase bank files that we know are in all the other documents.
[23:01.080 --> 23:03.200]  So that's what's frustrating.
[23:03.200 --> 23:04.280]  I already know all this.
[23:04.280 --> 23:05.440]  You've already heard it all here a hundred times.
[23:05.440 --> 23:08.520]  This is old news, but how do I know all this?
[23:08.520 --> 23:09.520]  But Congress doesn't.
[23:09.520 --> 23:10.520]  That's the issue.
[23:10.520 --> 23:13.520]  Jim Jordan talks a good game and I like him overall.
[23:13.520 --> 23:18.880]  But he didn't go as far as Devin Nunes and we know he takes a lot of Google money and
[23:18.880 --> 23:24.080]  he, it turned out, is supporting them, creating more of a centralized monopoly.
[23:24.080 --> 23:28.360]  And so he's saying he's thinking about an investigation, not that they have the house.
[23:28.360 --> 23:34.520]  He's thinking about Frank Church style hearings they had in the 1970s exposing the deep state
[23:34.520 --> 23:38.040]  that they thought committed all these crimes and they did on a Richter scale.
[23:38.040 --> 23:40.800]  It's like a one compared to a 10.
[23:40.800 --> 23:43.200]  This thing's almost off the charts.
[23:43.200 --> 23:45.600]  And so Congress is thinking about it.
[23:45.600 --> 23:47.920]  The Republicans are thinking about it.
[23:47.920 --> 23:53.600]  Well, you better think fast and think hard because you are going along with this.
[23:53.600 --> 23:57.640]  Just like Trump did with a bunch of lip service until he got censored.
[23:57.640 --> 24:03.120]  Twitter files part nine, vast web of coordination between tech giants, CIA, State Department
[24:03.120 --> 24:04.120]  and other agencies.
[24:04.120 --> 24:05.120]  Fox News.
[24:05.120 --> 24:11.160]  Oh, I told you it was CIA and State Department the whole time because I got approached and
[24:11.160 --> 24:14.280]  threatened by them folks and I'm not going to get it all over here on air, but it's been
[24:14.280 --> 24:16.240]  a interesting seven years.
[24:16.240 --> 24:19.760]  I'll leave it at that.
[24:19.760 --> 24:26.480]  House Republicans warning House Republicans warming to church style committee to probe
[24:26.480 --> 24:28.680]  FBI from top to bottom.
[24:28.680 --> 24:32.680]  Oh, they're warming.
[24:32.680 --> 24:33.680]  How nice.
[24:33.680 --> 24:38.280]  Meanwhile, AI machines could control humans and make decisions for us that we don't act
[24:38.280 --> 24:40.240]  now experts warn.
[24:40.240 --> 24:41.240]  And that's absolutely true.
[24:41.240 --> 24:46.160]  And it's AI already to a great extent in charge of big tech once it's programmed deciding
[24:46.160 --> 24:48.920]  who to censor.
[24:48.920 --> 24:52.680]  Then Garrison's got a new cartoon out of Alice in Wonderland with Musk is the rabbit saying
[24:52.680 --> 24:53.920]  let's go down the rabbit hole.
[24:53.920 --> 24:54.920]  You go down it first.
[24:54.920 --> 25:00.520]  It's Twitter banned Trump and his supporters and it's Jack Dorsey saying nobody's censoring
[25:00.520 --> 25:05.400]  nobody's being banned and protecting child porn and you go deeper down the rabbit hole.
[25:05.400 --> 25:09.080]  It's the FBI working with Biden in the new world order since everybody in a lifetime
[25:09.080 --> 25:10.680]  and you go into the deepest areas.
[25:10.680 --> 25:15.560]  It's Fauci suppressing all the medical news that his shots were poisoned and suppressing
[25:15.560 --> 25:18.360]  therapeutics.
[25:18.360 --> 25:21.800]  The good of save people.
[25:21.800 --> 25:26.160]  Rachel Levine ripped for demanding censorship and misinformation on gender affirming care
[25:26.160 --> 25:28.280]  for kids as young as five.
[25:28.280 --> 25:33.600]  That's the man that dresses like a woman that says he's a five star admiral of the Department
[25:33.600 --> 25:38.280]  of Health who admits he wants full access to your children in the state to control your
[25:38.280 --> 25:40.920]  children's destinies.
[25:40.920 --> 25:44.000]  Tim Lou attacks new Twitter files misinformation.
[25:44.000 --> 25:46.480]  Immediately gets dragged by Elon Musk for spreading this information.
[25:46.480 --> 25:49.600]  Yeah, Lou just says they're not real.
[25:49.600 --> 25:53.000]  He's still following the FBI's BS from a week ago where they said, oh, none of this is real.
[25:53.000 --> 25:54.400]  Now they're like, of course we did it.
[25:54.400 --> 25:55.720]  It's no big deal.
[25:55.720 --> 25:58.560]  Here's another one.
[25:58.560 --> 26:03.760]  Mike Davis slams James Dolan using facial recognition to remove rivals from arenas he
[26:03.760 --> 26:04.760]  owns.
[26:04.760 --> 26:09.760]  Yeah, lawyers that are involved suing any of this billionaire's facilities like Madison
[26:09.760 --> 26:10.760]  Square Garden.
[26:10.760 --> 26:14.560]  When you try to go see a show there, it instantly face scans you and has you thrown out.
[26:14.560 --> 26:17.120]  Oh, but what do you think the airports are putting in?
[26:17.120 --> 26:18.120]  What are you?
[26:18.120 --> 26:20.240]  They're not at the southern border, but they're in the airports for you.
[26:20.240 --> 26:21.680]  What do you think Whole Foods is putting in?
[26:21.680 --> 26:24.440]  What do you think the control grid is?
[26:24.440 --> 26:29.480]  Meanwhile, Whole Foods, this video is coming up announced a year ago.
[26:29.480 --> 26:32.800]  They're going to put in kiosk and make you scan a QR code to be able to come in the grocery
[26:32.800 --> 26:33.800]  store.
[26:33.800 --> 26:37.200]  This is the future of shopping for what they already have in Europe and Australia.
[26:37.200 --> 26:39.200]  If you don't have your COVID shot, you can't get in.
[26:39.200 --> 26:42.960]  And I saw comments on M4 Wars and we wrote about it Saturday saying, oh, Jones doesn't
[26:42.960 --> 26:43.960]  know this.
[26:43.960 --> 26:45.680]  Jones doesn't know what those QR codes are for.
[26:45.680 --> 26:51.960]  PS, it's a global standardized social credit score run by the Communist Chinese, the WEEF.
[26:51.960 --> 26:53.240]  Standardized and rolled out two years ago.
[26:53.240 --> 26:56.040]  It's a global policy and a global law of the UN already.
[26:56.040 --> 26:57.800]  I know every damn bit about it.
[26:57.800 --> 27:01.680]  And I'm so sick of some of the listeners and readers that just think I spout stuff off
[27:01.680 --> 27:02.680]  here.
[27:02.680 --> 27:03.680]  This is all happening.
[27:03.680 --> 27:04.680]  It's not coming.
[27:04.680 --> 27:07.920]  Look at this.
[27:07.920 --> 27:12.280]  The Roomba, you know those little robots that folks have that roll around your house and
[27:12.280 --> 27:16.640]  tie into all the other smart hubs, well now they're posting pictures of people having sex
[27:16.640 --> 27:20.160]  and people on the toilet and everything else because it's wiring it all back to the big
[27:20.160 --> 27:23.360]  tech companies that's selling the data and of course some of it leaks.
[27:23.360 --> 27:28.240]  Yes, all the home assistants, all the cameras on your phones, they're all recording you
[27:28.240 --> 27:32.000]  all the time, on record.
[27:32.000 --> 27:37.040]  Big article on the Roomba, it's like 20 pages long, you should go read it.
[27:37.040 --> 27:38.280]  Roomba recorded a woman on the toilet.
[27:38.280 --> 27:43.160]  How does ScreenShop offer it on Facebook, Roomba, vacuum companies say the images are safe,
[27:43.160 --> 27:48.320]  but a sprawling global supply chain of data from our devices creates risk, creates risk,
[27:48.320 --> 27:51.040]  it shouldn't be done.
[27:51.040 --> 27:56.280]  The rings on your house, all of this crap, it goes on and on and on.
[27:56.280 --> 27:59.880]  David Knight tweeted this, it's an image really tells it all, it's you know those grocery
[27:59.880 --> 28:04.800]  stores have those shopping carts with a toy car attached to the front so the two-year-old
[28:04.800 --> 28:06.600]  can sit there and turn the drive in the car.
[28:06.600 --> 28:10.000]  Well, that's really how the tech companies work, you think you're in control, they're
[28:10.000 --> 28:11.000]  in control.
[28:11.000 --> 28:18.600]  Meanwhile, Dallas has put in the first all-robot McDonald's, the ruling elites say we need
[28:18.600 --> 28:24.040]  millions of expendable immigrant laborers, they also say technology is the future.
[28:24.040 --> 28:29.720]  If robots can flip burgers, why are they still flooding the market with illegal labor?
[28:29.720 --> 28:32.920]  It's about displacing humans.
[28:32.920 --> 28:36.120]  And if you think you're going to protest in the real world, UK police arrest woman for
[28:36.120 --> 28:41.400]  silently praying, are you praying yes, she goes to jail, spends Christmas in jail.
[28:41.400 --> 28:45.520]  Okay, that's some of the social media stack.
[28:45.520 --> 28:50.520]  We got to one stack, which stack will we hit next?
[28:50.520 --> 28:53.680]  Which one should we go into first?
[28:53.680 --> 28:56.120]  What ties into this stack the best?
[28:56.120 --> 29:00.560]  Ah, the new climate lockdown is being announced.
[29:00.560 --> 29:04.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now launching the most powerful supplements in the history
[29:04.520 --> 29:09.680]  of InfoWars under a new brand name, InfoWars Platinum.
[29:09.680 --> 29:14.400]  Now all three of these revolutionary products you see in front of you are already number
[29:14.400 --> 29:19.440]  one best sellers in the market for the last few years because they work so well.
[29:19.440 --> 29:23.480]  We've gone right to the manufacturer, who are listeners, the owners of fan, and they've
[29:23.480 --> 29:29.360]  given us this huge deal off of retail, 40% off what these products are found for under
[29:29.360 --> 29:31.400]  other names.
[29:31.400 --> 29:36.240]  And not just under one name, they sell these under three or four other brands that other
[29:36.240 --> 29:38.440]  major distributors and suppliers have put out.
[29:38.440 --> 29:43.000]  The difference is, we have it for 40% off what it is in stores.
[29:43.000 --> 29:44.880]  We're talking about Payne MD.
[29:44.880 --> 29:47.560]  We're talking about HGH Max Boost.
[29:47.560 --> 29:50.440]  We're talking about 1776 testosterone boost.
[29:50.440 --> 29:52.040]  These things are incredible.
[29:52.040 --> 29:55.920]  I would suggest you take half a dose or less what you first do and consult your health
[29:55.920 --> 30:01.840]  care provider, those are so powerful, get them at infowarsstore.com InfoWars MD is finally

[32:08.440 --> 32:10.280]  Because they know we're pro-human.
[32:10.280 --> 32:12.000]  They know we're telling the truth.
[32:12.000 --> 32:13.560]  They know we've got their number.
[32:13.560 --> 32:19.800]  They know everything we do is about empowering humanity and God gave us through Mother Nature
[32:19.800 --> 32:25.080]  incredible compounds that will supercharge our body's stamina, libido, energy and immune
[32:25.080 --> 32:31.560]  systems and we came out many years ago with Real Red Pill Plus that has all the documented
[32:31.560 --> 32:38.560]  compounds like preglonone and so much more to supercharge your body and to give your
[32:38.560 --> 32:44.820]  body the key elements and the key ingredients it needs to function at a proper level.
[32:44.820 --> 32:47.800]  This is the answer to the New World Order's tyranny.
[32:47.800 --> 32:56.200]  This is Real Red Pill Plus sold out for two years, 50% off at infowarsstore.com.

[33:01.560 --> 33:15.440]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:15.440 --> 33:26.560]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex
[33:26.560 --> 33:27.560]  Jones.
[33:27.560 --> 33:34.080]  All right, I spent much of segment two and all of segment three on the incredible latest
[33:34.080 --> 33:38.160]  dump that just get more and more powerful, the Super Burger, the opposite of a nothing
[33:38.160 --> 33:44.600]  burger from Elon Musk, illegal spying, illegal transfer of national security, highest level
[33:44.600 --> 33:52.680]  clearances, pop secret to thousands of people, all the big tech companies in on it, surveillance,
[33:52.680 --> 33:59.080]  censorship, control of elections, of border news, of war news, of drag queen story time
[33:59.080 --> 34:06.320]  news, of transgenderism targeting children news, of medical COVID news by top scientists,
[34:06.320 --> 34:14.320]  true evil, suppressing the people and consumers, absolute organized levels of control only
[34:14.320 --> 34:17.600]  rivaled by the communist Chinese.
[34:17.600 --> 34:24.960]  And then one more little piece of data, congressman Ted Lube has come out with Adam Kinziger the
[34:24.960 --> 34:31.480]  last two weeks and said that Elon Musk is a liar and that the Twitter files aren't real.
[34:31.480 --> 34:37.400]  The FBI last week called it a conspiracy theory, now they have to admit all the documents are
[34:37.400 --> 34:42.240]  real as we covered last segment and say, but it's no big deal.
[34:42.240 --> 34:47.120]  Now why do you think Adam Kinziger and Ted Lube came out in the last two weeks, we showed
[34:47.120 --> 34:53.800]  you the article last segment and said this isn't real?
[34:53.800 --> 34:59.720]  Because Obama had it put in the legislation and signed it in late 2016 and executive order
[34:59.720 --> 35:07.000]  early 2017 before he left office to put billions of dollars upwards of three billion, a little
[35:07.000 --> 35:13.400]  bit shy of three billion in the defense budget to have the State Department and the CIA completely
[35:13.400 --> 35:14.400]  take over big tech.
[35:14.400 --> 35:19.000]  They already had liaisons, they already had a lot of control, but that's when the acceleration
[35:19.000 --> 35:23.920]  of the surveillance and the censorship began if you can remember, and if you remember.
[35:23.920 --> 35:30.920]  So now let's look at who sponsored that legislation that was added as a writer on the Defense
[35:30.920 --> 35:37.080]  Authorization Act of 2017 that put the group under Trump to undermine his presidency and
[35:37.080 --> 35:41.800]  work in a silent coup against the American people and that's what this is, is a big tech
[35:41.800 --> 35:45.680]  coup by the deep state, kind of a big deal.
[35:45.680 --> 35:53.000]  HR 5181, countering foreign propaganda disinformation act 2016, that was the enabling legislation
[35:53.000 --> 35:58.960]  for everything they did, that's why they called everybody Russian agents when they censored
[35:58.960 --> 35:59.960]  you.
[35:59.960 --> 36:05.040]  And look who the author is, Adam Kinziger, crybaby, and then representative Ted Lube.
[36:05.040 --> 36:11.000]  That's what M4Wars does, we do the research, Rob do found this, and then we cover it and
[36:11.000 --> 36:15.600]  then great people like Tucker Carlson's crew, they see it, they check it, and we'll probably
[36:15.600 --> 36:21.080]  on Tucker tonight, which I'm glad that's happening, because we're all in a team effort here.
[36:21.080 --> 36:26.440]  I learned a lot from Tucker, but Tucker will tell you, nine times out of ten, when they're
[36:26.440 --> 36:29.800]  getting some big breaking thing on this, Alex Jones was right.
[36:29.800 --> 36:33.880]  This is what we do here, and that's why staying on air is so important.
[36:33.880 --> 36:37.720]  But there it is, no wonder.
[36:37.720 --> 36:43.320]  No wonder they're telling you that none of this exists because they wrote the damn thing.
[36:43.320 --> 36:52.120]  It'd be like Ernest Hemingway saying, the old man in the sea doesn't exist, or for whom
[36:52.120 --> 36:59.720]  the bell tolls doesn't exist, you're like, Ernest, you wrote those books, you won Nobel
[36:59.720 --> 37:00.720]  Prizes.
[37:00.720 --> 37:06.240]  Nope, I know nothing about it, I just wrote it.
[37:06.240 --> 37:10.320]  I mean, the intelligence agencies wrote it, you sponsored it and you voted for it.
[37:10.320 --> 37:13.280]  So we're going to get more into that.
[37:13.280 --> 37:17.840]  I want to get into the carbon taxes being rolled out, and I want to get into all that
[37:17.840 --> 37:21.920]  massive news here in just a moment.
[37:21.920 --> 37:27.240]  But before we do that, I've got some really, really sad news here and an announcement I
[37:27.240 --> 37:32.560]  want to make, and it's hard to talk about this because it just stirs so many deep feelings
[37:32.560 --> 37:37.800]  in me on so many fronts, how much I love my family, my children, this crew, the audience,
[37:37.800 --> 37:42.360]  the listeners, everybody.
[37:42.360 --> 37:46.200]  The older you get, the more people you know that have died.
[37:46.200 --> 37:51.720]  I remember being there when my grandfather died, and I remember being there, watching
[37:51.720 --> 37:56.080]  a car wreck and seeing people's arms and legs and heads cut off, flopping around dying, how
[37:56.080 --> 37:57.080]  traumatic that was.
[37:57.080 --> 38:07.320]  You just, as you get older, you just realize how short life is and how precious it is and
[38:07.320 --> 38:11.520]  how beautiful the world is and how beautiful the stars and the planets are and how amazing
[38:11.520 --> 38:17.440]  the birds are and the insects and the fish and just the people and the art and the literature
[38:17.440 --> 38:20.040]  and the culture and everything we do.
[38:20.040 --> 38:22.120]  Yeah, we're ugly, but we're also beautiful.
[38:22.120 --> 38:28.440]  We've been given god-like powers of creativity by the creator of the universe, and we have
[38:28.440 --> 38:32.720]  to realize that it's not evil that defines us, it's the good that defines us.
[38:32.720 --> 38:39.320]  And a gentleman worked here for a little over 10 years that I got to be really good friends
[38:39.320 --> 38:46.120]  with in the last five, and he first worked in the shopping cart area with online orders
[38:46.120 --> 38:50.640]  and then because we could never get anybody really good to be the maintenance guy and
[38:50.640 --> 38:56.040]  run the actual facilities, about five years ago he took it over and he's just done a great
[38:56.040 --> 38:59.840]  job in all the things he did.
[38:59.840 --> 39:05.560]  And just last Thursday I was here at the office and we were talking and I said, I can't wait
[39:05.560 --> 39:11.640]  till the spring hits, let's go fishing again because he's spent the fourth of July with
[39:11.640 --> 39:19.040]  me at the lake, we've gone out to dinner, we've gone shooting, he's a friend, will always
[39:19.040 --> 39:25.520]  be a friend, because he's such a kind, friendly, smart person, and he lives on, his spirit
[39:25.520 --> 39:37.160]  is eternal, but the day after Christmas in the morning I got a call from one of the crew
[39:37.160 --> 39:43.720]  members and he said, I don't know how else to put this, but Chris Andrews died yesterday,
[39:43.720 --> 39:49.680]  39 years old, worked out, didn't smoke, didn't drink, and I just sat there for like a minute,
[39:49.680 --> 39:55.080]  couldn't even talk, and I said, Chris Andrews died and he said, yeah, they just had Christmas
[39:55.080 --> 40:01.440]  at his house, he just got married three weeks ago, he was so happy, great lady, and they
[40:01.440 --> 40:06.800]  were loading up some presents to go see family, he put a box in the back of his SUV, he said,
[40:06.800 --> 40:14.000]  I'm dizzy, and he laid down on the ground, I talked to his wife and had trouble breathing
[40:14.000 --> 40:19.600]  and then stopped breathing, when paramedics got there, he was already dead, they tried
[40:19.600 --> 40:24.920]  to resuscitate him for 45 minutes on the scene, and the medical examiner has his body, but
[40:24.920 --> 40:28.960]  his spirit has gone on to the next level, and if anybody's going to heaven, it's Chris
[40:28.960 --> 40:37.720]  Andrews, it's just devastating, and he was so happy, and he was such a great guy, and
[40:37.720 --> 40:44.120]  I was going to go out with him and his wife and my wife and kids on the lake and fish
[40:44.120 --> 40:48.800]  and swim and can't do that now, but he just got married to this great lady, these love
[40:48.800 --> 40:58.640]  for years, three weeks ago, and he died on Christmas Day in his parking lot, and he's
[40:58.640 --> 41:06.200]  gone, and so that's how serious the world is, he did not take the vaccine, he did not
[41:06.200 --> 41:11.440]  have any heart issues, but you have to know that he did get COVID a year and a half ago,
[41:11.440 --> 41:15.080]  and it does attack the heart, the vaccine creates the same spike protein at a higher
[41:15.080 --> 41:19.400]  level, the studies show in the body, we're giving it to our little babies now, and we're
[41:19.400 --> 41:23.680]  seeing mass death, all the actuaries and insurance company numbers show that, highest death rate
[41:23.680 --> 41:30.200]  increased since they started actuaries 150 years ago, and so I don't know if they haven't
[41:30.200 --> 41:34.800]  done the autopsy yet or that information isn't out yet, but they said they thought it was
[41:34.800 --> 41:39.560]  a heart attack, and I'm just speculating that it could have been from damage from COVID,
[41:39.560 --> 41:46.160]  but it's a very serious situation, and Chris didn't have a ton of money, I know I've donated
[41:46.160 --> 41:51.880]  some and the crew has as well, under the live show feed on infowars.com, under the live
[41:51.880 --> 41:57.960]  show today, under the live show feed, there's a link to the memorial for Christopher Andrews
[41:57.960 --> 42:03.920]  on GoFundMe, and I hope the leftists don't take it down because he worked at infowars,
[42:03.920 --> 42:06.960]  but they have no souls, so who knows what's going to happen, but I've donated I think
[42:06.960 --> 42:14.080]  anybody that appreciates infowars work or knew Chris should make a donation to his widow,
[42:14.080 --> 42:20.520]  and that's really all I can say about the situation, but the good day young they say,
[42:20.520 --> 42:29.240]  I probably lose to be about 180, but seriously, I just look at my dad, I look at my mom, I
[42:29.240 --> 42:33.440]  look at my family, and I just can't imagine losing them, but I was very close to my grandparents,
[42:33.440 --> 42:36.960]  I lost them too, and I've lost so many friends, and then I think about other targeting newborn
[42:36.960 --> 42:41.800]  babies with a scar, but it makes my blood boil, but Chris, we love you, we appreciate you,
[42:41.800 --> 42:45.920]  you'll always be with us, and I just hope we can continue infowars on, because I'd
[42:45.920 --> 42:50.240]  asked him a few months ago, I said, you think I'd hang this up, he said no, never surrender,
[42:50.240 --> 42:55.920]  never give up, and I'll be by your side, and he's still by my side in our side today,
[42:55.920 --> 43:00.400]  bye Kandiyos, Christopher Andrews.
[43:00.400 --> 43:06.280]  There's a war against our masculinity, there's a war in the environment, the food, the water,
[43:06.280 --> 43:12.160]  the air, the electromagnetics, the injections, to really cut us off from what God designed
[43:12.160 --> 43:19.760]  us to be, but through mother nature, the creator gave us compounds that can counteract
[43:19.760 --> 43:23.640]  what the globalists have done, and I've got to tell you, all our supplements are great,
[43:23.640 --> 43:28.960]  but we've got a real game changer now, we've never put anything out that's powerful, it's

[44:05.480 --> 44:10.440]  victories tonight possible, the only thing that made any resistance to the war machine
[44:10.440 --> 44:16.080]  possible, the only thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and
[44:16.080 --> 44:21.680]  the school shutdowns and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible, that made
[44:21.680 --> 44:26.960]  any resistance to it possible was people continuing to support InfoWars, despite the
[44:26.960 --> 44:33.040]  massive lawfare being waged against InfoWars, despite the media defamatory libelous campaign
[44:33.040 --> 44:38.160]  against InfoWars, the ordinary people, the everyday people that buy products that make
[44:38.160 --> 44:43.440]  their own lives healthier, wealthier and wiser is what keeps InfoWars on the air, and what
[44:43.440 --> 44:49.720]  that does is keep the populist message alive in an era and an age of totalitarian oppression.
[44:49.720 --> 44:55.800]  So continue to do it, go to places like infowarsstore.com, go to places like Save InfoWars, continue

[45:16.840 --> 45:19.400]  about 1-2% per year.
[45:19.400 --> 45:26.600]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive and muscle loss.

[48:12.840 --> 48:19.840]  get that burst of endorphin and adrenaline and satisfaction and I'm getting a big feeling
[48:21.400 --> 48:25.680]  of satisfaction right now, coming up through my guts into my arms and the back of my neck
[48:25.680 --> 48:32.680]  into my head with chills, my jaw and my teeth, I just feel strong. I know we've done well
[48:32.920 --> 48:39.920]  in the mission. I only want to thank you for empowering me in this fight because my commitment
[48:41.000 --> 48:46.320]  against the enemy is absolutely, the number one thing in my life is to get them off our
[48:46.320 --> 48:51.640]  backs collectively and we will do it together. I don't want you to ever not think about how
[48:51.640 --> 48:56.000]  important you are in this fight and the great work you've done with your prayer, your word
[48:56.000 --> 49:02.640]  of mouth and your financial support. I've only gotten through one stack of news and I've
[49:02.640 --> 49:09.640]  got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 stacks
[49:10.720 --> 49:17.400]  left. So maybe we won't take calls next hour because I need to get to this. Yep, no calls
[49:17.400 --> 49:21.640]  today. I did a good job last week. Good calls four days. I'll take calls throughout the
[49:21.640 --> 49:25.000]  week again. You've got my commitment. I love your calls. Not today though. We have a guest
[49:25.000 --> 49:30.720]  in the third hour. I need to hit all this. I will. Very important. Each stack is just
[49:30.720 --> 49:36.040]  insanely revealing. And again, it's not just the listeners that are tuned in. The regular
[49:36.040 --> 49:42.240]  listeners who are awesome. It is the brain trust from Brazil to France, from South Africa
[49:42.240 --> 49:49.240]  to Nigeria to Japan to China to Russia to Canada. We are the resistance in this broadcast.
[49:49.640 --> 49:54.080]  Does the key analysis of the enemy, the deadly analysis against their operations and the
[49:54.080 --> 49:59.880]  information war, we carry it through and we can rally the human intelligence and the human
[49:59.880 --> 50:06.440]  power against the new world order. We can and we will and we must prevail. And speaking
[50:06.440 --> 50:10.720]  of that, I'm going to hit the big news that ties into the huge Twitter files that just
[50:10.720 --> 50:16.200]  get more powerful and more intense. The opposite of a nothing burger here in a moment. But
[50:16.200 --> 50:22.440]  first, the Cavalry's here. We had a lot of supply chain breakdowns last two years. Everybody
[50:22.440 --> 50:26.560]  knows that's all over the news. Everybody's had problems. We wouldn't cut the quality
[50:26.560 --> 50:31.760]  of our supplements. And so we were out of them a lot. And that's really what caused
[50:31.760 --> 50:36.400]  our funding problems was before when we could keep everything in stock. We would always have
[50:36.400 --> 50:43.400]  enough money to operate and even expand the operation. But COVID shot at us and missed.
[50:45.080 --> 50:50.800]  But it shit us and hit. We can delay that for stations, but that's an old saying, an
[50:50.800 --> 50:54.960]  old guy I know from Wisconsin. I guess it's a Wisconsin saying they shot at me and missed,
[50:54.960 --> 51:01.080]  but they crapped at me and hit. And it's the censorship didn't get us, but the supply chain
[51:01.080 --> 51:07.600]  breakdown did. Well, we've gotten almost everything back. We've gone to the actual found the suppliers
[51:07.600 --> 51:12.480]  of our main suppliers. They're already big companies. And so we've launched the whole
[51:12.480 --> 51:18.600]  info wars MD line that's going to end up being 50 products. The first 10 are out three CBDs
[51:18.600 --> 51:24.720]  an amazing turmeric 95 highest quality concentrate you can get. And so much more nitric boost
[51:24.720 --> 51:30.320]  for your heart, your lungs to clean out all the garbage and any type of issues. It's really
[51:30.320 --> 51:36.040]  powerful. It's the same thing that's in a beat extract, but even stronger. It's all there.
[51:36.040 --> 51:41.160]  It's all discounted 25% off the info wars MD line. And we can't ever go above 25% because
[51:41.160 --> 51:47.840]  the markup's not very big on it. And so there'd be no profit if we went 30, 40, 50%. So 25 is
[51:47.840 --> 51:54.240]  a big discount. Check out the info wars MD line at info wars store.com. And of course,
[51:54.240 --> 51:59.120]  we also have the info wars platinum line that is another pharmaceutical company. Not one
[51:59.120 --> 52:02.440]  of the biggest, but it's still a 10 million plus dollar a year company, the owners of
[52:02.440 --> 52:08.040]  big listener on spec with no money down because he believes in us. He let us take his number
[52:08.040 --> 52:14.120]  three is top three best selling products. He also makes supplements, but he makes products
[52:14.120 --> 52:17.840]  for Walgreens, everybody over the counter and prescription. Some of the top prescription
[52:17.840 --> 52:21.400]  drugs this company makes, but these aren't drugs. These are supplements, but these are
[52:21.400 --> 52:27.040]  already the top three pain management product pain MD testosterone boost. We gave it the
[52:27.040 --> 52:32.080]  name 1776, but it's already on store shelves and ordered online for twice the price. And
[52:32.080 --> 52:38.560]  of course, HGH max boost. And those images are deceiving the biggest container is the
[52:38.560 --> 52:45.760]  HGH max boost. All three of these products sell for $100 in stores or online under their
[52:45.760 --> 52:50.320]  different names. But this is the exact same product, but we're selling it to you right
[52:50.320 --> 53:01.800]  now for $56 or 40% off HGH max boost. Oh no, excuse me. It's 50% off HGH max boost 1776
[53:01.800 --> 53:07.040]  testosterone boost and pain MD. And all I can tell you is take a smaller dose upfront,
[53:07.040 --> 53:11.680]  consult your physician or medical care provider. If you've got any questions because these
[53:11.680 --> 53:18.560]  are not joke products. Okay. This is like insane. There's a reason these are all three
[53:18.560 --> 53:23.560]  number one on the market under other names show info wars platinum. And I'm going to
[53:23.560 --> 53:27.440]  tell you this, do not take HGH max boost in the morning or during the day unless you want
[53:27.440 --> 53:31.960]  to go see P time. It's not sold to something that makes you sleepy, but I had my family,
[53:31.960 --> 53:36.160]  my wife, my dad, my mom, much the crew have taken it for six months ago. We were, you
[53:36.160 --> 53:39.400]  know, making sure we're going to sell it and it does incredible things to rest you and
[53:39.400 --> 53:43.840]  clean you out and reboot your cells. But what it does in the mitochondria with some of the
[53:43.840 --> 53:50.640]  ingredients that's got the Olympic athletes and people take it reboots. So I took some
[53:50.640 --> 53:58.160]  last night. I slept. I never get up at 8am. I went to bed at 10pm, set my alarm, ignored
[53:58.160 --> 54:08.560]  it. And I slept 10 hours. Folks, I always sleep six hours, 10 hours last night, like
[54:08.560 --> 54:14.160]  a dead man. When I woke up, my arm was under me on my face and it was asleep. That hadn't
[54:14.160 --> 54:17.320]  happened since I was a teenager. I'd sleep super hard. I mean, I was sleeping so hard
[54:17.320 --> 54:21.200]  that my arm was under me and I couldn't get up. Not my wife getting up, making noise,
[54:21.200 --> 54:26.320]  not my daughter running around. None of it woke me up until 7.59. I woke up and I was
[54:26.320 --> 54:30.440]  just like, Whoa, you know, remember when you were a kid, you'd sleep so hard, you'd like
[54:30.440 --> 54:35.000]  get up and almost hurt. You're like, Whoa, take like five minutes to gain your focus.
[54:35.000 --> 54:38.000]  I haven't slept like that in years and years and years, even with our other sleep aids
[54:38.000 --> 54:43.600]  that are great. I get a deeper sleep, a better sleep, but I'd still wake up three, four times.
[54:43.600 --> 54:48.120]  I'm saying this is a sleep aid because it just, what it does, rebooting, making your
[54:48.120 --> 54:53.920]  body reboot, like turning a computer on and off, it's next level. So get that at infowarstore.com
[54:53.920 --> 54:59.960]  or call toll free, triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. But again,
[54:59.960 --> 55:07.720]  infowarstore.com and Real Red Pill Plus sold out for two plus years is amazing. I'm not
[55:07.720 --> 55:10.240]  going to get into all the things it'll do for you, but it's got everything, all the
[55:10.240 --> 55:14.040]  vitamins, the trace elements, the minerals, the preglonone, that's the precursor, all
[55:14.040 --> 55:17.920]  hormones in your body that your body produces naturally. But as you get older, stops producing,
[55:17.920 --> 55:21.440]  you can't make the hormones you need. If you don't have preglonone, that's the reason
[55:21.440 --> 55:25.760]  so many men have low tests. It's why women have the issues. Just the preglonone alone
[55:25.760 --> 55:30.480]  is the reason to take it. Real Red Pill Plus also has some natural stimulants in it. It
[55:30.480 --> 55:34.640]  is next level back in stock, infowarstore.com. Okay, I'm going to stop plugging there. We've
[55:34.640 --> 55:36.920]  got to find the operation. These are great products. I want to thank you all for your
[55:36.920 --> 55:43.440]  support. I'd make the New Year's resolution to get the InfoWars MD. Just the CBD oil alone
[55:43.440 --> 55:48.560]  is 1000 milligram. We have the weaker 25 milligram gummies. What it does for pain, what it does
[55:48.560 --> 55:54.040]  for joints, no THC doesn't get you high. It's full spectrum, high quality. That's selling
[55:54.040 --> 56:02.080]  out, by the way, under the InfoWars MD banner at infowarstore.com. Okay, I'm done plugging.
[56:02.080 --> 56:04.760]  Let me tell you what's coming up next hour. I'm going to start into this. I'm going to
[56:04.760 --> 56:11.760]  go right into it, because as I said, it ties into the Twitter files that are so huge. This
[56:11.760 --> 56:17.480]  is banning the cows, not just overseas, but coming here. This is banning fireplaces here
[56:17.480 --> 56:24.760]  in America, banning space eaters. This is banning gas eaters. This is QR codes to buy and sell,
[56:24.760 --> 56:31.560]  total harassment, turning the power off deliberately during freezes. Just absolute, taking us back
[56:31.560 --> 56:37.360]  not just to the medieval times, but taking us back to the Stone Age before humans on
[56:37.360 --> 56:41.800]  a routine basis, harnessed and controlled fire. So they're trying to take us back to
[56:41.800 --> 56:48.480]  prehistoric times. Literally, this stack is unbelievable, and it's got a lot of clips
[56:48.480 --> 56:52.360]  in it too. So I'm going to try to get through this in a couple of segments, and then we're
[56:52.360 --> 56:58.120]  going to hit the war news. We're going to hit the Republican spending legislation news,
[56:58.120 --> 57:03.840]  the latest FTX news, the latest Jeffrey Epstein pedophile news, the latest obviously COVID
[57:03.840 --> 57:08.680]  news is off the charts. It just gets more intense by the day. That is a massive stack,
[57:08.680 --> 57:14.440]  and more on the dollar collapse and just a lot more coming up. Maricopa County, Katie
[57:14.440 --> 57:19.240]  Hobbs that ran the election and put ballots that weren't big enough to work on purpose
[57:19.240 --> 57:26.960]  and all the Republican precincts seeks more than $500,000 for Hillary attorney Mark Elias
[57:26.960 --> 57:31.880]  and sanctions for Kerry Lake and her lawyers. Yeah, when they rape you and steal the election,
[57:31.880 --> 57:37.440]  they then rape you in the court for attorney's fees. I've experienced that. So they bring
[57:37.440 --> 57:42.160]  the suits and ring courts, and they charge you or if you bring suits in their courts,
[57:42.160 --> 57:46.280]  they then throw it out and charge you. That's how these people operate through judicial
[57:46.280 --> 57:49.720]  tyranny. We'll be right back.
[57:49.720 --> 57:54.360]  I've taken a lot of supplements over the years since high school, and they had great effects.
[57:54.360 --> 57:58.960]  The science has gotten better and better and better over the years. And now with all the
[57:58.960 --> 58:03.760]  things we're bombarded with and the water and the food and the feminizing factors, it
[58:03.760 --> 58:08.880]  is more important than ever to use the compounds God gave us to boost our natural male potential.
[58:08.880 --> 58:13.280]  These products work great for women as well. Ladies and gentlemen, we have Payne MD. It's
[58:13.280 --> 58:19.200]  the number one natural bestseller under another name. We got it discounted for 40% off infowarestore.com
[58:19.200 --> 58:25.360]  under the label InfoWars Platinum. We've also got HGH Max Boost. Read all about it. Be very
[58:25.360 --> 58:28.960]  safe with it. I take only a fraction of what they say at first and take it before you go
[58:28.960 --> 58:35.440]  to bed at night. Don't do it during the day. 1776 testosterone boost. Totally incredible.

[59:03.440 --> 59:07.600]  The real red pill plus one of our top sellers before over two years, it's been sold out
[59:07.600 --> 59:13.600]  because of supply chain breakdowns. It's finally back at stock or 50% off at infowarsore.com.
[59:13.600 --> 59:17.640]  Now, the limited time we have, I can't get into all the ingredients there in it. With

[59:48.840 --> 01:00:00.840]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:06.640]  If any clip ever goes viral, it's this one. It's on band.video at infowars.com. It's the
[01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:15.360]  miscarriage of statistics. Let's first go back to this Great Mike Adams article that
[01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:22.160]  came out in July of last year. It links right to the New England Medical Journal that hides
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:26.840]  it deep in the study. That's an 82% of pregnant women who got vaccinated for COVID during
[01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:31.560]  the first and second trimesters suffered miscarriages. It's still a very, very large amount as well
[01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:39.800]  you can read in the third trimester as well. That's also in the double digits. Here's one
[01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:40.840]  of the studies.
[01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:46.520]  Culinary findings of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine safety in pregnant women. Miscarriage, stillbirth
[01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:52.200]  rates exploding worldwide as depopulation continues, animated. You can see the graph there from
[01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:56.280]  the federal government's own numbers, similar numbers around the world. Exposure to COVID
[01:00:56.280 --> 01:01:01.120]  vaccine spike protein renders women infertile. Nurse whistleblower, fetal deaths have skyrocketed
[01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:05.840]  since pregnant women started using, being forced to get COVID-19 shots. Australia sees
[01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:10.800]  63% drop in birth after introduction of COVID vaccines. What will the government's excuse
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:16.840]  will be? Hospital president. COVID-19 vaccines causing miscarriages is complete myth, plain
[01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:17.840]  and simple.
[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:22.520]  I'm very happy to report that among the tens of thousands of women who have been closely
[01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:28.200]  studied after they chose to get the COVID-19 vaccines, the data is clear these vaccines
[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:35.700]  are safe. The often mentioned but completely unsubstantiated concerns about COVID-19 vaccines
[01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:41.280]  causing either miscarriages or other problems with their pregnancy or causing problems getting
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:45.680]  pregnant is a complete myth, plain and simple.
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:49.280]  Where's the study? The tens of thousands of women. Where is it? They admit it's all lies.
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:53.600]  Pfizer fake reports as well. This guy is a lying scumbag. So he doesn't give me facts,
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:57.000]  doesn't give me statistics, doesn't give me numbers. He just says we have thousands
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:02.400]  of women and none of them had a problem. No, no, no. There's nobody, nobody's dying.
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:03.400]  No children are dying.
[01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:10.120]  I've been actively miscarrying since the eighth. I have gone to a doctor and this is my second
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:16.800]  visit to ER. If you're wondering why women's rights matter, this is my way. Nobody actually
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:22.280]  has come down. They're always going to send me home.
[01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:26.520]  These are the folks that tell you the two men can have a baby. It's all upside down world.
[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:30.480]  You know, they use DNA to prove somebody committed a murder 30 years ago, and that's all scientific.
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:36.880]  But now the science guy, Bill Nye's new shows, tell kids that there are no X and Y chromosomes.
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:41.480]  They're murdering the truth. They're murdering science. And he sits up there and says out
[01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:47.280]  of tens of thousands of women, nobody's had a miscarriage. Nobody's had a sick baby. That's
[01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:48.400]  a damn lie.
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:55.640]  I see a vast number of patients a year. I don't know of any other maternal field medicine
[01:02:55.640 --> 01:03:01.840]  physician in this country that sees as many patients as I do by ultrasound. At one point
[01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:08.560]  in time this year, I was on track to see 9,000, 9,000 high-risk OB ultrasounds. So I know
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:14.520]  what's going on. And I've seen death and destruction like I've never seen before.
[01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:19.960]  The stilberth rate is measured in terms of live births per thousand. And really it's
[01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:26.400]  come down in my career from about 10 to about almost 5.8 or 6.
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:34.400]  Now let's go to 2021 and look at the stilberth rate for Michele's. This is horrifying. But
[01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:43.880]  if you take this death figure and you look at that rate at 29.3, that's sigma that you're
[01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:54.680]  looking at is 40 plus sigma. Standard deviation. Let that sink in.
[01:03:54.680 --> 01:04:02.200]  And what I've seen in my clinical practice has been a substantial, massive increase unprecedented
[01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:11.200]  in menstrual abnormalities prior to pregnancy. A substantial increase in infertility. A substantial
[01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:19.040]  increase in miscarriage, fetal death and fetal malformation. We published many studies
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:27.160]  this year over the last two years. Our latest study which we've used from VAERS and CDC data
[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:35.920]  and we compared the COVID-19 vaccines over the last 15, 18 months with those of the influenza
[01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:41.880]  vaccine pregnancy. And what we've seen is catastrophic.
[01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:48.680]  What did Alexander Seltzenitze say about this? He goes, we know they are lying. They know
[01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:54.800]  they are lying. They know we know they are lying. We know they know we know they are lying.
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:55.800]  But they are still lying.
[01:04:55.800 --> 01:05:07.480]  I want you to remember two words, infowars platinum in the history of infowars supplements
[01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:13.840]  and they're amazing. This is hands down the most powerful game changing products we've
[01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:18.120]  ever offered to the public. Now all three of these are private labels of three national
[01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:23.080]  bestsellers put out by a pharmaceutical company that also makes high end supplements. And
[01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:28.120]  the owner is a listener and a supporter. So they are giving them to us at 40% off what
[01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:34.080]  they are sold on stores, over 20% off what they are sold online under the infowars platinum
[01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:42.160]  brand name. These are incredible. Pain MD, HGH max boost and of course 1776 testosterone
[01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:46.680]  boost. Read about them at infowarsstore.com, learn about them and then try them out for

[01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:57.440]  make your life more amazing and it will keep us on the air a 360 win. Infowars Platinum
[01:05:57.440 --> 01:06:09.560]  now available at infowarsstore.com From the front lines of the information war, it's
[01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:23.880]  Alex Jones. The first hour I got into the super burger, they're calling it a nothing
[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:32.520]  burger, the 15th data drop or is it 16th now of Elon Musk and the Twitter files about
[01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:37.360]  the Justice Department and NGOs and all these groups and top security clearances and giving
[01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:42.320]  employees security clearances to spy on everybody and censor everybody on every subject you
[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:46.320]  can imagine. From coming after our kids with transgenderism, to open borders, to lock downs,
[01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:52.120]  to force injections, the shots hurting people, they've been caught censoring Nobel prize winners
[01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:58.560]  for medicine and internally saying shut this down, shut that down. Big pharma was interfacing
[01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:02.000]  there as well. The UN came out two months ago and bragged that they helped quarterback
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:07.360]  all the censorship. Oh, you don't want to pay a carbon tax? You want to protest having
[01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:12.000]  your farm taken? Whether you're in Australia or the Netherlands or Canada, we're just
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:19.400]  going to censor you and it's all globally run. So, let's run through this whole stack
[01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:23.280]  here and I'm not going to play it because it's in German and it has subtitles. We're
[01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:30.680]  going to put it on screen while I talk about it. German health minister says climate change,
[01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:35.320]  global restrictions and prohibited behavior will be required. What they say two years
[01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:39.080]  ago, what did I tell you? They're going to come out with climate lockdowns and your QR
[01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:42.880]  codes. Even if you can't afford a phone, they're going to make you have one under universal
[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:46.520]  basic income that tracks everywhere you go and what you do and tells you when you can
[01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:51.800]  leave your house, when you can leave your coffin apartment and what you can do. Here's
[01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:58.800]  numbers out of the US. This can't go on. We used to spend 4% of our global GDP on energy.
[01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:05.480]  Now we spend 14%. Current energy crisis costs 10% or $10 trillion each year. Here are global
[01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:10.280]  numbers that pretty much match US numbers. They've just decided to increase that so you
[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:16.320]  have no discretionary income to control you. Meanwhile, Greta Thunberg's global warming
[01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:22.040]  conference was canceled due to subarctic freezing temperatures, which they say is global warming.
[01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:29.360]  Tucker Carlson, an excellent job years ago on this, race yourselves for climate lockdowns,
[01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:33.960]  are coming. He got attacked for it now. It's all happening. US Energy Department declares
[01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:39.920]  grid, emergency and Texas-submit power vortex. There's not enough power because they won't
[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:44.560]  let them increase the power. There's federal caps on it. They've cut the amount of power
[01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:50.200]  we can use. Meanwhile, there's a new World Economic Forum video out where they brag
[01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:57.560]  that France is banning domestic air flights and making you take the train to save the
[01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:01.880]  earth, but the elite's private jets, no problem. Here's another one, liberal city and acts
[01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:11.640]  anti-pollution order banning all fireplaces. Now they're moving to ban gas power and space
[01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:20.000]  heaters. Europe did it years ago. Total absolute control. California's now banned all small
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:27.920]  gas engines. They say by 2030, they're banning all gas engines. Can't make that up.
[01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:32.120]  Farmer predicts worse food shortages, higher prices of 2023, and meant inflation throughout
[01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:39.920]  interest rate hikes. Big Fox News report. Wondering why your Christmas was more expensive
[01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:44.520]  than this year? Maybe you have something to do with the fact that just four firms control
[01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:50.960]  25% of the beef market, higher prices for you or profits for them. That's Robert Reich,
[01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:56.200]  the former labor secretary of Bill Clinton. And it's a very important video that I'm
[01:09:56.200 --> 01:10:01.320]  going to get back to in a moment. We're going to cue that up because everything he tells
[01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:08.800]  you is true, except he doesn't tell you why it happened or who lobbied Congress to do
[01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:13.720]  the policies to make sure farmers don't get any of the money and that it destroys and
[01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:18.040]  consolidates power and jacks up prices. We're going to look at that in a moment, but let's
[01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:28.000]  continue workers could face a 40% tax on pay to fund new universal basic income in Europe.
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:34.280]  And the UK's announcing similar plans. See, take away your job, make you go on welfare
[01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:41.600]  for total and complete control. Here's one independent article. But that's the plan.
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:46.760]  Take the jobs away, tax people 40% on top of things to pay for those that don't work,
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:53.400]  encourage people to commit suicide. dystopia, the bring down of civilization. 1200 scientists
[01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:59.840]  and professionals declare there is no climate emergency promptly are censored by big tech.
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:05.440]  I should have covered this more the last month, but more than 100 towns and cities in the UK
[01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:10.880]  under a UN directive have now banned cars in their main cities and have set up checkpoints
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:22.520]  on major highways blocking cars can't make that up. Absolutely over the top.
[01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:27.600]  Then of course, we've got video DC Whole Foods and poses QR code system to shop. They've
[01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:32.080]  announced this is going to go in nationwide. Austin where I live has hand scanners to buy
[01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:36.440]  and sell. It's all been announced as a new global system, airports are putting in face
[01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:41.280]  scanners and QR codes saying will be mandatory. They're trying to force mandatory shots, but
[01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:44.840]  even on info wars, some of the commenters were like, Oh, this is made up. Who knows
[01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:51.080]  if this lady's right about this? No, the lady's informed. This is the future of so-called shopping.
[01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:54.160]  Germany and France already put these in the major shopping centers and grocery stores.
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:12:00.600]  You can't come in if you haven't had your COVID shot. That's this is all about whether
[01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:06.160]  you're in Australia or whether you're in Canada or places like Italy, it's all the same global
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:11.840]  standardization. Some good news. Robert Barnes had success. He's on the show Thursday. Amish
[01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:19.480]  farmer wins court battle for food freedom can return ties into the Robert Reich piece.
[01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:28.520]  I'm going to get to next segment. He says it's the big four ag companies doing it. Yeah.
[01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:32.520]  And who do you think wrote the regulations to shut everybody down? We're going to be
[01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:37.320]  getting to that coming up. Meanwhile, look at this image from Willy Wonka's chocolate
[01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:44.000]  factory 1970 film. It's hard to believe that this in 1971 was seen as an obese boy. Looks
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:47.800]  like he's just a little bit stocky. Now they tell us it's great to be overweight. Every
[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:51.240]  time I said, I will say, Well, you're a little overweight. Yeah, but doesn't mean I shouldn't
[01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:56.680]  work to lose weight. Doesn't mean we shouldn't encourage people to be healthy. Continuing.
[01:12:56.680 --> 01:13:01.680]  No more Helmets Mayo for me says in the back ingredients derived from bioengineered source
[01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:11.440]  coming. And you will eat the bugs and you will be happy. That's right. Robert Downey Jr.
[01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:17.440]  is now on TV with Stephen Colbert telling us how much he loves to eat the bugs. We're
[01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:25.160]  going to be getting to that coming up and I've got a lot more. But I wanted to show folks
[01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:30.760]  some images from Atlantic Beach, New Jersey. You can look this up. They talk about how
[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:34.800]  the beaches are getting bigger there. Some areas, the beaches get a road, some areas
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:41.400]  they get bigger. But here is satellite photos of 1995. And it's not just at the tides out
[01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:46.600]  the tides out in both photos. Look at how the greenery and the sand dunes are pushed
[01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:56.200]  way back to just 100 yards or so from the shore. Now look at the greenery today. It
[01:13:56.200 --> 01:14:01.080]  has advanced. See that right next to each other? That's the exact same shot. See the
[01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:08.080]  sand? See how it curves out? See it right there? And now look how much it's grown out.
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:13.000]  It's come out probably 60, 70 yards. That's the report the beach has gotten bigger. It's
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:18.600]  happening all over the world. In fact some evidence shows the sea levels are actually
[01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:27.720]  going down. I've got a lot more that I'm going to be hitting on next segment dealing with
[01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:32.080]  this and I'm going to shift gears into the economy itself. BlackRock, the world's largest
[01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:37.480]  asset manager says central banks are liberally causing recessions, warns of a downturn unlike
[01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:44.400]  any other three shock-proof assets to consider. Yahoo News. But it's BlackRock is the biggest
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:50.360]  contributor for the exact policies and Larry Fink, the head of it, gets up on the Debo's
[01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:54.120]  Group every time they have a meeting every month and says we need to cut off resources,
[01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:59.560]  consolidate control, get rid of people owning their own homes. They're driving all the policies
[01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:05.080]  and then like Robert Reich, they turn around and tell you they're going to protect you
[01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:09.800]  and they're going to save you just get on a universal basic income. Oh, by the way,
[01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:14.280]  don't eat beef and don't eat chicken and don't eat pork, but we need to save the pork and
[01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:22.320]  beef and poultry producers. So I'm going to destroy the former labor secretary who's admitted
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:26.280]  Marxist Leninist on the other side, but they know full well what they're doing. They always
[01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:30.600]  say communism creates utopia, it always creates a nightmare, but power and control for them
[01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:37.160]  pushing their godless system where they want to be god. So those clips are coming up of
[01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:43.240]  the robot McDonald's in Dallas of the QR codes to get into Whole Foods in DC and of so much
[01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:48.560]  more and Robert Reich's excellent little two minute video describing the raping of farmers
[01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:54.440]  and ranchers and food producers, but not telling you who runs the vacuum cleaner destroying
[01:15:54.440 --> 01:16:22.440]  the milk and honey. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:51.440]  Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next video. Bye bye.

[01:20:32.840 --> 01:21:00.600]  jones all right welcome back ladies and gentlemen so the most ancient form of governance and
[01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:08.200]  the most common form of governance in history undisputed whether you were in ancient Africa
[01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:16.480]  or ancient Asia or ancient Europe or ancient Mesoamerica was feudalism and 90% of people
[01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:26.040]  were kept at subservient subsistence barely survivable levels in fact in every culture
[01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:31.560]  the general public was called the little people because they were given so little food they
[01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:36.600]  were normally about four and a half to five feet tall the men were about five one around
[01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:44.160]  the world the women were about four nine four eight and the nobles and their enforcers about
[01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:52.000]  nine and a half percent would be the nobles enforcers the lesson one half a percent would
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:22:00.480]  be the rulers they would be six six and a half seven feet tall and the reason I raise
[01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:08.720]  that is you need to understand how long this has been going on and that lady that testified
[01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:14.880]  who's an academic quite famous Indian lady a few weeks ago in Congress she talked about
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:20.480]  her father growing up in the caste system in India and also under the British and how he
[01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:31.680]  was five feet tall because he was starved as a child and now her kids are six feet tall
[01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:38.960]  and see that's a real evidence factor of feudalism where it's the same system worldwide they keep
[01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:43.040]  you at a subservient starvation level even if you're allowed to live if you get caught
[01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:52.160]  killing a rabbit or stealing an apple off a tree you get tortured or you get executed
[01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:55.840]  so you're there to produce for the elites well now the so-called elites they have the technology
[01:22:55.840 --> 01:23:01.640]  they don't need you anymore and so coming after your energy coming after mobility Obama travel
[01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:05.600]  in the world telling Africans and people they can't have air conditioner cars the globalists
[01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:10.320]  can all have their private jets you just can't have a turkey for Christmas all of this is
[01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:16.160]  about teaching you that feudalism and serfdom is good for you because there's not enough resources
[01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:19.920]  and that's why they had human sacrifice in every culture was where they would make poor people
[01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:24.480]  turn over their sons particularly they don't want too many young men around to be sacrificed on
[01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:31.920]  key holidays to make the god of the harvest produce more harvest so they put superstition
[01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:36.880]  into the people that's why the UN knowing back 30 40 years ago it's in a in-game
[01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:46.240]  2 1.5 that's the little piece we put out in game 1.5 we show the university and UN documents
[01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:53.600]  where they said we're going to bring feudalism back we're going to bring serfdom back to control
[01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:58.640]  people and we're going to give people such bad nutrition that if a child has bad nutrition
[01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:04.880]  the brain doesn't develop as well and people are stupid and so that's exactly what happens
[01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:09.840]  that's why they know you can take people from a poor area in Africa or Latin America and
[01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:16.480]  they can come here and have children and their children's IQs go up their their health goes up
[01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:21.920]  they're healthier because they're getting more food so that goes for anybody but instead we get
[01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:26.720]  all this trash food that doesn't have any real nutrients in it a bunch of additives and fillers
[01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:32.560]  again this is all part of a strategic globalist plan in their own words so an intern now the former
[01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:39.600]  Labor Secretary and Marxist-Leninist Robert Reich telling you what's happening to farming
[01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:44.080]  and why the prices are going up not telling you it's two plus years of lockdowns that these very
[01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:49.040]  big companies lobbied for that the deep state went along with not telling you that the big
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:56.720]  agricultural companies for the last 50 years lobbied and used the FDA to go around and shut
[01:24:56.720 --> 01:25:00.640]  down all the small meat packers it's almost impossible I know a lot of big ranchers and I
[01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:04.480]  know some very wealthy people that looked into starting new meat packing facilities because
[01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:08.400]  they're also in steakhouses and things and they were told the government won't let you they'll
[01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:14.240]  come after you if you get one inspection failure as a small operation even if you're quite large
[01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:20.080]  comparatively small you get shut down but if you're Tyson or Cargill you can have a thousand problems
[01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:24.480]  you might get a small fine so they wrote the regulations and now they're going after omission
[01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:29.280]  going after small farms and going after community fairs where people slaughter their own pigs and
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:33.920]  their own cows and they have and produce their own milk it has much statistically better healthier food
[01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:40.080]  people want that but there's a war on that and the communist bean counter after they cut your
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:45.440]  legs off wants to sell you a wheelchair after they've taken full control of your life they sit
[01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:50.400]  there and act like oh government with regulations just like the union said oh we'll keep your jobs
[01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:55.040]  here but they sold them out faster so they talk a good game the unions talk a good game the the
[01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:58.720]  communists talk a good game but at the end of the day they work for the establishment to consolidate
[01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:03.760]  power that's what crocs doing oh the federal reserves doing policies right now that are
[01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:08.080]  going to hurt things and hurt you we don't want that even though they want to consolidate control
[01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:12.640]  they don't want to get the blame the WEF doesn't want to get the blame the UN doesn't want to get
[01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:17.280]  the blame big tech doesn't want to get the blame but they're the ones quarterbacking at all here's
[01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:24.880]  the club monopolies are slowly killing rural america and driving up the price you pay for food
[01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:32.080]  just four firms control 85 percent of all beef 66 percent of all pork and 54 percent of all poultry
[01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:38.240]  this degree of monopolization is hurting farmers and you monopolists control nearly
[01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:43.920]  every part of the food production process from selling feed to farmers to packaging the meat
[01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:49.920]  and poultry for supermarkets half of all chicken farmers report having just one or two processors
[01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:56.320]  to sell to farmers are essentially forced to buy from and sell to monopolies at whatever price
[01:26:56.320 --> 01:27:02.720]  the corporation wants often taking on crushing debt to do so they're trapped in long-term binding
[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:08.400]  contracts with no way out but losing their livelihood altogether either i sign it or i ain't got no
[01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:15.840]  chicken without any chickens i can't pay any bills i can't pay my mortgage meatpackers used to compete
[01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:20.240]  at cattle auctions for what ranchers produced which helped ranchers get a reasonable return on
[01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:26.160]  their investment now with so few buyers ranchers have no choice but to sign contracts with meat
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:32.080]  packers and sell their cattle for a lower price than if the market were truly competitive in 1980
[01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:40.000]  62 cents of every dollar consumers spent on beef went to ranchers today only 37 cents due most of
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:45.360]  the profits are going into the pockets of the monopolists and here's the kicker even though
[01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:50.320]  farmers are getting squeezed the ag monopolists are also we're gonna come back and play the
[01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:55.360]  rest of this because there's a few more minutes left but again i'm gonna walk through the evidence
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:28:00.400]  every policy the deep state particularly democrats have passed the republicans have stood by has
[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:05.920]  allowed this what did the lockdowns do it doubled and tripled the profits of all the biggest corporations
[01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:10.240]  while destroying tens of millions of us jobs everybody knows that they told you just sit home
[01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:14.800]  for two weeks that's six months they locked down latin america and africa for two years
[01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:21.680]  now there's giant refugee columns coming here they orchestrate all of this on record and if we
[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:26.720]  wake up to the predatory nature of this and get governors and legislatures and some good members
[01:28:26.720 --> 01:28:32.080]  of congress on board will defeat this they're backing off shutting down the farms of the nether
[01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:37.520]  ones they're backing off in france those people are fighting back and we need to join them peacefully
[01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:42.880]  with civil disobedience and say no and realize your whole future is this folks no matter how good
[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:46.640]  your job is or what you think you're gonna do in the future the whole new world order is coming in

[01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:24.560]  all right so robert rike puts out these videos last we put out before this was attacking me
[01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:31.200]  and he explains hey your christmas roast costs so much more all because four companies owned by
[01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:37.040]  the big banks have been consolidating power in the us to where the farmers can only sell to them
[01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:43.920]  and only buy from them and that's true but it's congress and it's the left and it's the big
[01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:48.000]  corporations like black rock that have been financing this in bill gates promoting it trying
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:53.040]  to shut down traditional farming and ranching look at how the new head of the un's farming
[01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:57.840]  division is the former head in the netherlands and he wants to totally shut down farming
[01:33:57.840 --> 01:34:04.400]  saying it's bad because cows pass gas well all life forms do and it helps create the atmosphere
[01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:10.080]  but notice it's climate change they can list anything as bad they want so
[01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:16.480]  here's one little propaganda piece he put out in 1980 62 cents of every dollar consumers spent on
[01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:23.920]  beef went to ranchers today only 37 cents due most of the profits are going into the pockets of the
[01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:30.080]  monopolists and here's the kicker even though farmers are getting squeezed the ag monopolists
[01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:37.200]  are also charging you higher prices during the pandemic beef prices rose nearly 16 percent
[01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:43.920]  and the four biggest beef companies profits rose more than 300 percent these corporations are using
[01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:50.400]  their monopoly power to fix prices just recently beef giant gbs settled without admitting guilt of
[01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:57.680]  course a beef price fixing case for 52.5 million dollars we've never witnessed this level of
[01:34:57.680 --> 01:35:02.320]  concentration in the history of our industry this situation is urgent monopolization is
[01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:08.880]  happening across the food sector and corn soybeans dairy pesticides and farm machinery the result is
[01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:15.760]  the same lower pay to farmers bigger profits for the monopolists higher prices for you a better
[01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:21.120]  way to hold these monopolies accountable would be to break them up and stop future mergers but it
[01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:26.320]  won't be easy they flex their political muscle through powerful lobbies like the north american
[01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:31.840]  meat institute and maintain a revolving door of the regulatory agencies like the u.s department
[01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:38.400]  of agriculture well i say take them on rural america's hurting farmers are getting squeezed
[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:44.240]  and consumers are being shafted notwithstanding the power of food monopolies taking them on
[01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:49.840]  is wildly popular especially in rural america but don't just listen to me listen to what farmers
[01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:56.640]  are saying about this i'm here to tell the powers that be to enforce the antitrust laws for the
[01:35:56.640 --> 01:36:03.280]  world of agriculture the laws around the we have to strengthen those laws and do what teddy
[01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:09.520]  roosevelt did to break up the monopolies don't let these boys who come to washington with pockets
[01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:15.280]  of money set there and bribe our congressman year after year after year who will stand up for me
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:23.200]  if you don't for the good of us all american needs to enforce antitrust laws and break up big ag
[01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:31.200]  robert rike helped pass a lot of the regulations that allowed this to happen written by tyson foods
[01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:36.720]  that funded over 70 percent of clinton's gubernatorial and then upwards of half of his first presidential
[01:36:36.720 --> 01:36:44.400]  campaign so he's literally put in power by these people who now want new regulations
[01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:51.840]  that they're pushing you will eat the bugs to shut down at the actual farming level and make sure
[01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:57.520]  there's less farmers producing less beef less chicken less pork less corn they're all out there
[01:36:57.520 --> 01:37:02.560]  lobbying to cut production that's why they cut off the pipelines for the gas and the oil which
[01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:08.240]  then goes directly to farmers not being able to buy enough fuel to run their tractors and farm
[01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:15.280]  machinery so here's a communist what a communist always do shut the food off lecturing you how he
[01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:20.640]  wants to save you now these people are beyond disgusting let's play the cobert clip with
[01:37:20.640 --> 01:37:25.600]  robert downey jr there's hundreds of these clips so-called movie stars telling you how great it
[01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:33.840]  is to eat bugs you can bet money he's not eating bugs here it is right what is that well that's
[01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:40.000]  an insect-based premium protein it's made from molitor which is mealworm larvae uh the company
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:48.560]  is called insect this is in france this is for fertilizer and as you have there this is a powder
[01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:55.920]  derived from the mealworm and it's a insect protein just been approved by the eu for human
[01:37:55.920 --> 01:38:03.040]  consumption you're not just getting me to eat dirt are you no man i wouldn't play your bro no you
[01:38:03.040 --> 01:38:08.160]  wouldn't play anybody would you you little monsters while you eat caviar all day they hate your guts

[01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:21.840]  we're now in operational pedal to the metal uh let's play the video of the totally automated
[01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:27.600]  robot run mcdonalds of dallas let's play a little clip uh there's much of these on info wars.com
[01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:35.600]  of the dc Whole Foods and it's not just the lady saying it's the future it is the future they've
[01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:38.800]  announced they're going to put these in all over the world with her soul foods and make you qr
[01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:43.280]  code to get in and then track your control and get you used to that with the new carbon
[01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:48.160]  with the new carbon taxes and where they're going to tax you for what you buy and what you do

[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:39.040]  act like the central banks that are private shareholders owned by black rock are to blame
[01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:45.440]  they're blaming the government that they control when the government is just the mechanism it's
[01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:52.000]  like if don corleone orders one of his captains to go murder somebody and then they only arrest the
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:57.120]  foot soldier that carries out the murder and not even the captain or don corleone and so robert
[01:41:57.120 --> 01:42:02.320]  right is a captain of the new world order mafia and he's carried out his attack on the food they've

[01:47:23.760 --> 01:47:27.280]  all right we are back ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us
[01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:30.640]  have a great guest coming up next hour we'll introduce her once she's here
[01:47:30.640 --> 01:47:37.760]  the infrastructure is being turned off we take this incredibly complex just on time delivery
[01:47:37.760 --> 01:47:42.960]  system where we get thousands of choices at the shopping market where we have all the security
[01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:49.840]  and electricity at the flip of a finger but that's our weakness before the texas instrument's
[01:47:49.840 --> 01:47:56.240]  calculator was created most people can do basic mathematics now they can now i can't i can't do
[01:47:56.240 --> 01:48:00.320]  stuff i did when i was 10 years old don't remember it because i use a calculator and it all sounds
[01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:05.120]  great but it removes us from the process of manufacturing and farming and everything else
[01:48:05.760 --> 01:48:10.960]  until everything's virtual and the globalists admit they are greasing the skids of all of this
[01:48:10.960 --> 01:48:18.720]  to make us obsolete and that's what the whole new world order is but here is a really important
[01:48:19.760 --> 01:48:26.800]  facet to understand they need a global government because if they raise taxes to 90
[01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:32.560]  percent like france has people will flee if they raise taxes to 70 like new york city people will
[01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:38.400]  flee if they raise taxes like san francisco people will flee they have to have a one world system
[01:48:38.400 --> 01:48:46.400]  administered by ai and there's two competing systems the chai comms the globalists right now
[01:48:47.920 --> 01:48:52.960]  that are basically merging into one so that no one can escape it after world war two the
[01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:56.720]  the organization of economic cooperative development was set up
[01:48:58.880 --> 01:49:03.680]  and that was the marshal plan and that's when the british banks and the u.s banks took over europe
[01:49:03.680 --> 01:49:08.960]  set up the bill de berg group and the whole plan we see now the eu plan everything and they said in
[01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:14.560]  there we're going to create global crises in the future using the environment and viral scares
[01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:21.360]  to collapse the world economy and create a marshal plan through the oecd and the central banks
[01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:27.920]  with a central bank digital currency they said this over 30 years ago that's how i know their whole
[01:49:27.920 --> 01:49:34.000]  plan it's how i tell you decades ago people go find access tv shows of mine 26 27 years ago
[01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:38.480]  and they're going viral everywhere going how the hell did this guy know all this
[01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:44.000]  and there's this constant idiotic thing i see well he's an intelligence agency asset
[01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:48.880]  it's the only way he knows i don't mind being called that but it's ridiculous
[01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:55.440]  they tell you what they're going to do how did i know the vaccines weren't vaccines and
[01:49:55.440 --> 01:49:59.600]  would kill a bunch of people cause heart attacks and infertility they did rat studies with similar
[01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:07.840]  mRNA technology at the university of texas in 2014 how did how did the cdc in october 2020
[01:50:07.840 --> 01:50:11.600]  for anybody taking the shot put out that report saying it's going to cause heart attacks and death
[01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:21.680]  because we because it's on record so here's the headline voting with the feet new york losing
[01:50:21.680 --> 01:50:26.640]  people as fast as rate of any state next to california census finds but they're bringing in
[01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:33.440]  illegal aliens that came and use a toilet that they can control but if they get it in everywhere
[01:50:33.440 --> 01:50:41.120]  then nobody can flee from it they'll have their cashless society in place that's what the qr codes
[01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:46.960]  are about that's why the oecd threw the u n through the wef two and a half years ago
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:51.600]  whether you were in eastern europe or whether you were in
[01:50:52.400 --> 01:50:58.160]  german south africa or whether you were in mexico city or whether you were in bunisari's
[01:50:58.160 --> 01:51:02.400]  or whether you were in dallas texas all of a sudden you'd walk into a restaurant once they've
[01:51:02.400 --> 01:51:07.360]  been closed for a few months there'd be qr codes and no menus it wasn't menus were bad or dirty
[01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:12.000]  they were training you to show your identity to buy and sell and australia admitted it
[01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:18.800]  and so did places in the e you so let's get this clip vaccine passport central bank digital
[01:51:18.800 --> 01:51:24.560]  currency and digital id are framed as for our security and convenience but it's a contract
[01:51:24.560 --> 01:51:29.680]  designed to reduce our freedoms for control and power as it's discussed here in one of the big
[01:51:29.680 --> 01:51:37.040]  covid conferences that is taking place we're going to play that in a moment we have the italian uh new
[01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:41.200]  prime minister coming out and saying it's all about a digital currency to control you so we
[01:51:41.200 --> 01:51:48.000]  have people exposing this and we know what's going on but once they have the oecd that's the global
[01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:58.320]  corporate consortium in full control its mouthpiece is the debos group its actual private brain
[01:51:58.320 --> 01:52:04.080]  trust is the builder group it's game over but we have the enemy battle plan and if you know the
[01:52:04.080 --> 01:52:08.640]  enemy's battle plan and you educate people that it's a horrible dystopia again it should be easy
[01:52:08.640 --> 01:52:12.880]  to beat it and that's why they're so scared and losing the info war despite all the censorship
[01:52:12.880 --> 01:52:19.360]  they admit that this battle plan is all coming out and that makes it very hard for them to be able
[01:52:19.360 --> 01:52:25.120]  to execute their operations if people know they're the ones causing the pain that's why they've got
[01:52:25.120 --> 01:52:34.880]  black rock and robert reich and others scurrying around telling you that they're doing all of
[01:52:34.880 --> 01:52:38.640]  this for your own good or that they're trying to stop another group that's doing it because they're
[01:52:38.640 --> 01:52:43.760]  an organized corporate crime syndicate taking over the world to create a worldwide depression
[01:52:43.760 --> 01:52:48.240]  to bring in a cashless society control grid to then carry out even bigger bio attacks
[01:52:48.240 --> 01:52:54.000]  and forced injections and depopulation so we're in a very dangerous serious world we got a good
[01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:58.480]  shot at stopping this or at least mitigating it but believe me you're gonna wish in a few years
[01:52:58.480 --> 01:53:03.840]  or even sooner you've done something you say well what do we do there's a lot of things you can do
[01:53:03.840 --> 01:53:09.120]  folks you're not stupid call congress go speak at city councils sue people pull your kids out of
[01:53:09.120 --> 01:53:14.080]  public school stop shopping at big mega chains support mom and pops get into farming you know
[01:53:14.080 --> 01:53:20.960]  just think about the future under this and get ahead of it now it's all pre-plotted it's all
[01:53:20.960 --> 01:53:27.200]  pre-programmed here's a clip about what the digital society is really all about but the thing that
[01:53:27.200 --> 01:53:36.000]  really woke me up was digitalization in particular vaccine passports vaccine passports for me as a
[01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:42.800]  liberal a lifelong liberal the most authoritarian draconian illiberal measure that has been seen
[01:53:42.800 --> 01:53:46.480]  in the modern era and it's been rolled out around the world and I know that many people here would
[01:53:46.480 --> 01:53:55.040]  share that and so that's when I went into the rabbit hole of becoming a conspiracy theorist
[01:53:56.560 --> 01:54:03.040]  and so you know the sort of batterings I get on twitter actually post them I want to laugh at
[01:54:03.040 --> 01:54:08.480]  some of the comments on the other side and so the people who were my friends back in 2019
[01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:15.840]  they all hate me and the people who are my enemies you're all here you you all seem to like me
[01:54:15.840 --> 01:54:21.680]  even toby but the point of this because I'm conscious of the time and I like to talk is that
[01:54:21.680 --> 01:54:27.920]  I'm really concerned I think where we are right now is much more concerning than even the problems
[01:54:27.920 --> 01:54:33.920]  over the last two years I think there's a mission creep towards all things digitalization under
[01:54:33.920 --> 01:54:40.240]  the auspice again of safety and also convenience and I'm also concerned while more and more people
[01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:44.640]  are looking at this especially through a cost of living crisis and wondering what's coming next
[01:54:44.640 --> 01:54:50.560]  and getting angry with government I think we need to find ways to stop the division and unite everyone
[01:54:50.560 --> 01:54:55.360]  against the people who are putting this mission creep in place to lose even more freedoms in the
[01:54:55.360 --> 01:55:00.880]  future and that is largely a ring to link to around digitalization I think one other aspect of this
[01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:07.520]  with my tin foil hat on as a conspiracy theorist is I think all around the world central bank
[01:55:07.520 --> 01:55:14.160]  digital currencies are either in pilot scheme or executive order stage in the states other
[01:55:14.160 --> 01:55:21.040]  floating under the radar our previous chancellor now an elected prime minister Rishi Sunak is
[01:55:21.040 --> 01:55:29.680]  clearly a big fan as is his frat boy pen pal best mate Justin Trudeau these individuals are pushing
[01:55:29.680 --> 01:55:35.360]  it in this direction now I understand that there is a need for digitalization because the world
[01:55:35.360 --> 01:55:41.040]  moves on but what we shouldn't be losing is some of the assets that we still need such as cash
[01:55:41.040 --> 01:55:49.120]  cash is vital as a farmer's son I understand the values of the circular record all right so James
[01:55:50.080 --> 01:55:54.560]  Melville is absolutely right and even our best brains are just now figuring this out hey James

[02:00:41.440 --> 02:00:46.880]  info wars is fighting for all of us info wars is the tip of the spear we're only here because
[02:00:46.880 --> 02:00:53.120]  of you and watch this information dealing with the spike protein and dealing with the vaccines
[02:00:53.120 --> 02:01:06.880]  they're not vaccines
[02:01:06.880 --> 02:01:16.240]  look at that holy cow instantly cleared i've never seen anything do that and i don't mean
[02:01:16.240 --> 02:01:23.520]  to sound sensational i just right i haven't never seen any do that nope never seen anything do that
[02:01:30.960 --> 02:01:38.480]  okay so first take the normal one this is the regular without anything on it yep you can see
[02:01:38.480 --> 02:01:43.840]  little platelet clumps up in here throughout and then a couple of white cells in the background
[02:01:43.840 --> 02:01:48.880]  and well that looks pretty decent like you're gonna live forever tell all right good to know
[02:01:50.320 --> 02:01:55.040]  all right i'll see what the darno looks like so again we'll start kind of out at that thicker
[02:01:55.040 --> 02:02:02.720]  edge first work away towards should be the thinner portion of the prep question is where
[02:02:02.720 --> 02:02:14.640]  dole the cells go seriously they're gone seriously i pushed them back into a big giant clump over
[02:02:14.640 --> 02:02:21.760]  at the edged clump and again is is that the charge on the particles i don't know but where we put
[02:02:21.760 --> 02:02:26.320]  that drop there are no red cells there i was gonna say as they come out that's almost like
[02:02:27.040 --> 02:02:32.320]  you know like they're bleaching clear bleaching clear some of them are folded and some are called
[02:02:32.320 --> 02:02:38.240]  what do we call crenulated a little uh crinkled but yeah i mean that whole edge is like bleached
[02:02:39.840 --> 02:02:46.720]  so this is the j and j that's totally different isn't it there's like a nuclear bomb one off
[02:02:46.720 --> 02:02:52.560]  yeah it's disordered isn't it and then there's a little more of that stacking that real low here
[02:02:53.200 --> 02:02:58.320]  and and again look at all this clumping here out on the edge of it yeah it just yeah like you said
[02:02:58.320 --> 02:03:03.200]  like a nuclear bomb went off it just congealed it and again that's not spike that's just the
[02:03:03.200 --> 02:03:09.120]  liquid nanoparticle so these are becoming more spherical and you're losing that donut in the
[02:03:09.120 --> 02:03:13.360]  middle of your red cell what's happening here is slightly from the outside of the cell in
[02:03:14.080 --> 02:03:19.840]  causing those cells to blown up slightly because now you got a subtle osmotic shift here and all
[02:03:19.840 --> 02:03:25.120]  these are supposed to be you know again isotonic these are supposed to be balanced with the ph of
[02:03:25.120 --> 02:03:31.920]  the body you shouldn't shouldn't be seeing you know this kind of reaction it shouldn't be damaging
[02:03:31.920 --> 02:03:40.880]  to the cells of the body right away like this so here's that first visor and these are the ones
[02:03:40.880 --> 02:03:48.720]  where we just put a drop on and the whole thing just cleared but this is where all that fluid went
[02:03:48.720 --> 02:03:57.920]  and again like that j and j just caused immediate dispersion and clumping
[02:03:58.880 --> 02:04:06.160]  and those don't look very red to me either oh and look at this there's little spikies those are
[02:04:06.160 --> 02:04:16.160]  called echinocytes so it it instantly changed the ph interior these are little blobs of protein
[02:04:16.160 --> 02:04:21.840]  on the membrane of the red cell because the red cell has involuted and then those proteins on the
[02:04:21.840 --> 02:04:27.120]  surface they don't have room to go so it creates blood clots folks all four vaccines kind of all
[02:04:27.120 --> 02:04:32.160]  baggy but you know so all these little fingers that is not spike protein so that's another myth
[02:04:32.160 --> 02:04:35.920]  i want mine to spoil i mean it's crazy because it's done it to so many we didn't see that on the
[02:04:35.920 --> 02:04:40.800]  other one let it soak in folks they're telling you that's fascinating you can watch this video in

[02:06:26.480 --> 02:06:33.760]  stacks so far i've got 12 stacks left and so i may just have to go ahead and co-host with royce
[02:06:33.760 --> 02:06:37.840]  white next hour i think i'm probably gonna do that he won't mind everybody knows when they do the
[02:06:37.840 --> 02:06:42.320]  four dollars sometimes i commandeer it back or i co-host with him uh but we'll see if a royce
[02:06:42.320 --> 02:06:47.120]  is good for that i'm sure he is but i i've gotta hit the vaccine news it is the most positive
[02:06:47.120 --> 02:06:55.280]  amazing good news yet it is beyond the silver lining and it would not be out it would not have
[02:06:55.280 --> 02:07:00.880]  happened according to joe rogan and dr peter mccullough and tucker carlson and so many others
[02:07:00.880 --> 02:07:09.200]  that have given us credit with dr frances boil in january and february of 2020 when nobody
[02:07:09.200 --> 02:07:13.920]  else knew what was happening we said it'll be poison shots that'll cause blood clots we said
[02:07:13.920 --> 02:07:18.000]  there'll be ongoing lockdowns there'll be supply chain breakdowns it'll collapse the third world
[02:07:18.560 --> 02:07:23.840]  the west will be flooded the un will run the invasion i live this i'm in this constantly and
[02:07:24.960 --> 02:07:29.120]  again it's not about saying oh we're so great we're so good no we want to win this fight for
[02:07:29.120 --> 02:07:34.000]  our children and god put us in this position and god gave me this mind and then this platform
[02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:40.080]  with these great guests and callers and crew to be able to do this so the credit doesn't go to me
[02:07:40.080 --> 02:07:45.760]  it goes to all of us that listened to the holy spirit and the truth and they've been fighting
[02:07:45.760 --> 02:07:50.560]  and we've just begun to fight as john paul jones said the founder of the us navy we're gonna go
[02:07:50.560 --> 02:07:54.480]  to our special guests in a moment i want to hit a few of the things coming up because she wants to
[02:07:54.480 --> 02:07:58.960]  get into the shots so we'll do that some with her at the bottom of the hour but uh she's a well
[02:07:58.960 --> 02:08:03.200]  known talk show host and also was pardoned by president trump we'll be talking to her here in
[02:08:03.200 --> 02:08:07.440]  just a moment so i wanted to get her back on it's been over a year since she was here but first off
[02:08:07.440 --> 02:08:12.400]  i can't do the show without your support god keeps me in a very hungry position where we're
[02:08:12.400 --> 02:08:16.720]  right on the edge of red and black i need to be in the black financially to be able to just
[02:08:16.720 --> 02:08:22.000]  stabilize and know the future is secure we're doing such important work together plus our
[02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:27.600]  products are just as good as our information the very best out there our supplements are the best

[02:08:46.160 --> 02:08:52.960]  and that's the info was platinum line that's the info wars um d line and that is what i'm so excited
[02:08:52.960 --> 02:09:00.160]  about red real red pill plus this has been sold out for over two years it has all the trace
[02:09:00.160 --> 02:09:03.840]  elements all the minerals all the vitamins but more importantly it has some other proprietary
[02:09:03.840 --> 02:09:08.720]  ingredients supercharged the preglenone that's in it preglenone is made naturally in the body
[02:09:08.720 --> 02:09:13.520]  in all men and women but around the age 40 your body stops producing as much in fact the studies
[02:09:13.520 --> 02:09:18.400]  show the low testosterone and people are a 20 year old has a testosterone of a 70 year old is
[02:09:18.400 --> 02:09:23.840]  because their bodies are not producing preglenone because of all the endocrine disruptors and
[02:09:23.840 --> 02:09:28.960]  chemicals and things that are in the food and water but if you naturally aren't producing it then if
[02:09:28.960 --> 02:09:34.720]  you take high quality organic form preglenone it allows your body to start making the hormones again
[02:09:34.720 --> 02:09:40.320]  this has got the preglenone in it with everything else you need and if you really like it and you
[02:09:40.320 --> 02:09:45.440]  think it's it's doing great for you and most people have dramatic effects because this has
[02:09:45.440 --> 02:09:52.000]  stimulant in it you do not want to increase the dose but we're going to come out soon with a
[02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:56.960]  preglenone pill that's even stronger than what's in here it's got a good healthy amount in it that's
[02:09:56.960 --> 02:10:01.280]  safe for everybody but for folks that like the effects of real red pill the biggest thing and
[02:10:01.280 --> 02:10:06.080]  it's the preglenone so wherever you get it get it we're going to be selling pure preglenone very

[02:10:22.880 --> 02:10:27.680]  but it was a game changer for her and i learned about this from a medical doctor and in literature

[02:20:05.040 --> 02:20:23.440]  alex jones well i'm glad that angela stan king i really got to know last year when she was here
[02:20:23.440 --> 02:20:27.040]  in studio to follow her work is able to join us and i'm really glad she brought up the poison
[02:20:27.040 --> 02:20:33.120]  shots first because i went into the hundreds of studies didn't make your head spin and there was
[02:20:33.120 --> 02:20:38.080]  a new report that john bound put out showing actual statistics from the federal government
[02:20:38.080 --> 02:20:44.000]  from other governments showing the same numbers three four thousand percent increase in miscarriages
[02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:50.960]  and death and children hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times any previous record
[02:20:50.960 --> 02:20:55.920]  level i mean we're talking that you've seen the graphs they go straight up that john bound report
[02:20:56.480 --> 02:21:01.920]  is miscarriage of statistics it's on info wars dot com right now in band up video it needs to get
[02:21:01.920 --> 02:21:07.040]  out everybody needs to send it to every family and every woman you know and then tell them to share it
[02:21:08.160 --> 02:21:13.120]  with others as well it's slam dunk that they're covering this up but but here's Naomi wolf who's
[02:21:13.120 --> 02:21:19.040]  a big famous liberal and she's saying this isn't about left or right this is about mad science
[02:21:19.040 --> 02:21:23.520]  is a good and evil and all the different studies show it's directly targeting fertility it hits the
[02:21:23.520 --> 02:21:29.280]  heart it hits the ovaries it hits the testicles it's hitting it all and it's not just the shots
[02:21:29.280 --> 02:21:37.600]  kovat did that too but not as bad the shots are far far far stronger uh than it doesn't matter
[02:21:37.600 --> 02:21:42.640]  whether it's j and j astrazeneca doesn't matter if it's the mrna shots from um
[02:21:44.720 --> 02:21:49.680]  you know the companies that were developing that the fizer and the modernist it all's been programmed
[02:21:49.680 --> 02:21:54.240]  to create spike protein in the body that attacks all the different cells particularly fast growing
[02:21:54.240 --> 02:22:00.080]  cells there's nothing faster growing than a baby here's the clip the new york times was saying
[02:22:00.080 --> 02:22:04.880]  they reported to say it's safe and effective for pregnant women and they had no evidence to that
[02:22:04.880 --> 02:22:10.000]  to that effect so i guess what i'm saying is in terms of the fta food and drug administration
[02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:16.000]  right it is their job to make sure that drugs that are on the marketplace in the united states
[02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:23.840]  are safe and effective that is there like their only child right that in food so they knew you know
[02:22:23.840 --> 02:22:32.320]  they saw they knew no one it seems that the fta looked at these volumes of material proving
[02:22:32.320 --> 02:22:39.680]  that there were already women injured menstrually still births you know weird exposure through
[02:22:39.680 --> 02:22:45.840]  semen of vaccinated men um you know risks to you know at the time of conception no one said hey
[02:22:45.840 --> 02:22:51.920]  wait a minute what what this is a covid vaccine why are you even looking like the weird thing about
[02:22:51.920 --> 02:23:00.320]  the fta um i'm sorry the Pfizer document says how obvious it is that that this injection was studying
[02:23:00.320 --> 02:23:06.080]  the effect on the reproductive system right study like right it's supposed to be for a respiratory
[02:23:06.080 --> 02:23:13.600]  virus what the heck you know why are you dissecting the genitals of rats right so so there is no way
[02:23:13.600 --> 02:23:19.600]  to to to avoid the conclusion which is so terrifying that i live with this knowledge every day right
[02:23:19.600 --> 02:23:27.040]  that the american government authorized the ruin nation of millions of women's bodies
[02:23:28.400 --> 02:23:34.000]  knowingly with this injection let's expand on that i have the articles right here angela
[02:23:34.560 --> 02:23:39.280]  less than one percent of africa took the shot they had basically had zero covered uh less than
[02:23:39.280 --> 02:23:43.680]  one percent of Haiti took it they had zero covered i guess black folks black folks and we're not not
[02:23:43.680 --> 02:23:48.000]  to trust government when they want to put a shot you look at the ski experiment with a syphilis
[02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:52.560]  and so they didn't die they didn't get killed but here in america whether you're black white
[02:23:52.560 --> 02:23:58.320]  doesn't matter we're all being targeted and this is a a depopulation injection your view on that
[02:23:59.280 --> 02:24:05.680]  i mean it's nothing more than a depopulation um tactic that's exactly what it is along with abortion
[02:24:05.680 --> 02:24:10.480]  and the thing that you mentioned with the Tuskegee experiment that's nothing more than medical
[02:24:10.480 --> 02:24:15.360]  apartheid and it's something that we've been dealing with from the very beginning of time
[02:24:15.360 --> 02:24:21.360]  and it's just so sad that we are not even free in our own country you don't even have the freedom
[02:24:21.360 --> 02:24:26.640]  to speak up and to speak out and by this point i mean we should all know that something's not
[02:24:26.640 --> 02:24:31.840]  right i mean we see the news reports but we can just take personal accounts from families and
[02:24:31.840 --> 02:24:36.960]  friends for people that died suddenly or people who are perfectly fine and in the moment after
[02:24:36.960 --> 02:24:41.920]  they took the vaccine given two or three months they started having all type of complications
[02:24:41.920 --> 02:24:45.920]  it's happened in my own family it's happened to a lot of people that i've talked to
[02:24:45.920 --> 02:24:50.720]  and one of the things that i've always wondered alex i always wonder how it's something that
[02:24:50.720 --> 02:24:56.640]  broke off and started over in china travel all the way around the world and then when it gets here
[02:24:56.640 --> 02:25:03.040]  to the united state all we were hearing all summer long all went along all during covid was the black
[02:25:03.040 --> 02:25:07.760]  community the black community even bill gates and his wife had a video saying that the black
[02:25:07.760 --> 02:25:14.160]  community deserved to get the vaccine first and the numbers were just not adding up and now we're
[02:25:14.160 --> 02:25:19.680]  trying to rebuild from one of the most disastrous outbreaks that we have probably ever seen i know
[02:25:19.680 --> 02:25:26.560]  i've ever seen in my lifetime besides age and age and hiv but when i look at covid i can see a lot
[02:25:26.560 --> 02:25:32.160]  of similarities when it comes to fochi between how they played out the age epidemic and then now
[02:25:32.160 --> 02:25:36.960]  what's happening with covid well absolutely uh you know i don't bring this up because you happen
[02:25:36.960 --> 02:25:42.800]  to be black that's front and center of my stack today that we know blacks not to share but worldwide
[02:25:43.520 --> 02:25:46.800]  haven't targeted for depopulation so does everybody else but blacks particularly
[02:25:47.600 --> 02:25:52.320]  and the incredible news is black folks here in the u.s have the lowest uptake of the shots same
[02:25:52.320 --> 02:25:56.320]  thing in heydy same thing in africa looks like black people are really awake everybody else should
[02:25:56.320 --> 02:26:02.640]  wake up like they're awake yeah well we have a reason to not trust the government because like
[02:26:02.640 --> 02:26:07.760]  you say medical apartheid is something that's been going on for a very long time with the tiskegi
[02:26:07.760 --> 02:26:14.720]  experiment with uh the operations on um women that were slaves to advance medical practices
[02:26:14.720 --> 02:26:20.640]  i mean it's a long list of things that we have endured from this country and you got to think
[02:26:20.640 --> 02:26:24.560]  about it i mean when somebody is just forcing something on you pushing something on you they
[02:26:24.560 --> 02:26:30.240]  were giving out free strip dances for the vaccine crystals was giving out free chicken i mean
[02:26:30.240 --> 02:26:35.280]  they were all of the rappers were all of a sudden making videos and we're smited up to know that
[02:26:35.280 --> 02:26:39.520]  anytime somebody is trying to push something that i ought to give it to you that maybe you
[02:26:39.520 --> 02:26:43.680]  shouldn't take it and for those of us that didn't take it we're sitting back we're watching and
[02:26:43.680 --> 02:26:49.920]  we're like okay wow now who's crazy who's the conspiracy theories because it seems like everything
[02:26:49.920 --> 02:26:55.040]  was true well that's where i'm going next with this we can't just sit back and wait till they
[02:26:55.040 --> 02:26:59.200]  launch a new attack we can't just sit back and wait till they release a new virus they have to get
[02:26:59.200 --> 02:27:03.760]  prosecuted now and the good news is the sanis got the statewide criminal investigation the
[02:27:03.760 --> 02:27:08.000]  media made fun of it so the supreme court would never authorize it this is a statewide criminal
[02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:12.000]  investigation by the grand juries of the supreme court and there's ample evidence this is very
[02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:16.400]  exciting you have the german vice president calling for criminal investigation as well
[02:27:16.400 --> 02:27:20.880]  he is the vice president of the government he's extremely powerful he's calling for that right
[02:27:20.880 --> 02:27:28.160]  now listen anybody that is involved in this takedown of american citizens or the entire world
[02:27:28.160 --> 02:27:34.000]  for that much they definitely need to be prosecuted you know hats off to ron desantis for being the
[02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:39.360]  one to put this in motion he has my full support i love what he's doing down there in florida
[02:27:39.360 --> 02:27:44.000]  and you're absolutely right they need to be held accountable because what's around the corner next
[02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:49.040]  hope thank god omnichron didn't kick off the way that they thought it would or the delta variant
[02:27:49.040 --> 02:27:54.400]  because by that time we were all just over it i mean it scared us so much through fear mongering
[02:27:54.400 --> 02:27:59.040]  tactics if somebody calls on you you're gonna die if you get six feet within a person you're
[02:27:59.040 --> 02:28:03.600]  gonna die if you can't smell you're gonna die and the american citizens are like you know what
[02:28:03.600 --> 02:28:09.360]  wait a minute i'm over this and i think the psychological trauma from it all has done just
[02:28:09.360 --> 02:28:14.720]  as much damage as the vaccine itself i totally agree with you and again to be clear the virus
[02:28:14.720 --> 02:28:18.960]  is real it has the same effectiveness of vaccine this is not a vaccine but just not as bad and i
[02:28:18.960 --> 02:28:24.400]  go back to this because it's it's so incredibly true not just because you i say this every day not
[02:28:24.400 --> 02:28:29.920]  just because you're black on the show we know that vitamin d3 if you don't have it the winter's
[02:28:29.920 --> 02:28:34.240]  the real reason it's not cold weather gets you sick we're not getting sunlight we know black folks
[02:28:34.240 --> 02:28:39.040]  need three times more vitamin d supplements than others they deliberately held that back
[02:28:39.600 --> 02:28:42.960]  from black people in their cities that were getting no sun and that's why we had double the
[02:28:42.960 --> 02:28:49.360]  number of black people die statistically versus whites and so that was direct murder by them
[02:28:49.360 --> 02:28:52.880]  when they knew that if you have high levels of vitamin d3 you basically can't get it
[02:28:52.880 --> 02:28:55.520]  and they literally kept that back and murdered black people
[02:28:58.080 --> 02:29:02.320]  ladies and gentlemen we are now launching the most powerful supplements in the history of

[02:33:32.800 --> 02:33:37.360]  your vitamin d3 you better be getting it and people that live up towards the arctic circle
[02:33:37.360 --> 02:33:44.080]  have light skin so you absorb more sun your skin is what makes vitamin d3 and it's not in a lot of
[02:33:44.080 --> 02:33:49.920]  foods out there and everybody should be taking vitamin d3 look at this bottle of high end
[02:33:51.040 --> 02:33:59.040]  vitamin d3 gummies from info war store dot com for adults for children the whole thing is jam
[02:33:59.040 --> 02:34:06.080]  packed with these one of these a day all the studies show that if you have a high dose of it
[02:34:06.080 --> 02:34:10.800]  above the recommended daily allowance like they say three times which this is
[02:34:13.280 --> 02:34:18.640]  that if you have this 250 times the recommended daily allowance it's got a bunch of other stuff
[02:34:18.640 --> 02:34:24.480]  that's supercharging like calcium and some key enzymes that the viruses will not be able to replicate
[02:34:24.480 --> 02:34:29.120]  not just a covid virus any virus and think of their reign of terror with big tech censoring
[02:34:29.120 --> 02:34:33.360]  medical doctors and others that tried to warn people and tell them about this i don't care where
[02:34:33.360 --> 02:34:38.800]  you get your vitamin d3 ladies and gentlemen you need it but again if you have got dark skin
[02:34:38.800 --> 02:34:44.720]  particularly sub-saharan africans your skin's designed to be able to take a ton of sun but it
[02:34:44.720 --> 02:34:51.840]  doesn't produce as much and that's why there were twice as many black people died of covid-19
[02:34:51.840 --> 02:34:56.320]  was because the media would not tell them but i don't care what color you are my daughter's got
[02:34:56.320 --> 02:35:01.040]  porcelain white skin my five-year-old we're shoving these in her she loves them every morning
[02:35:01.760 --> 02:35:05.840]  and she had been getting sick now it doesn't mean everything's bulletproof folks but
[02:35:05.840 --> 02:35:10.240]  if you don't have all the vitamins and all the minerals you need not just covid but any virus
[02:35:10.240 --> 02:35:14.160]  can come along and replicate inside your body and the idea that the media tried to act like it was
[02:35:14.160 --> 02:35:18.640]  dirty or bad to tell people about this is just insane ladies and gentlemen
[02:35:18.640 --> 02:35:24.560]  so i want to be completely clear vitamins and minerals and clean water and food are not a cure
[02:35:24.560 --> 02:35:28.320]  to something because if you've gotten sick it means you didn't have enough of it already in you
[02:35:29.040 --> 02:35:35.200]  what it is is a preventative clean water all the vitamins all the minerals you need them all
[02:35:35.200 --> 02:35:41.520]  but vitamin d3 is the key and we've got vitamin mineral fusion all the vitamins all the minerals
[02:35:41.520 --> 02:35:46.800]  it's about to sell out key amino acids upload it to your body but despite that it's 50% off
[02:35:46.800 --> 02:35:51.040]  and enforce where i come you got cut off by the break you wanted to point something out when
[02:35:51.040 --> 02:35:55.920]  i was pointing out that where is the new black panther party telling black folks to get vitamin
[02:35:55.920 --> 02:36:02.160]  d3 uh i i mean louis furcon comes out and says don't uh take their shots don't trust him and he's
[02:36:02.160 --> 02:36:07.280]  smart but where is louis furcon telling black folks maybe he said it i'm i mean where is he
[02:36:07.280 --> 02:36:11.760]  saying it because if because i'm not up here in some goody tissue oh i'm black people and
[02:36:11.760 --> 02:36:15.760]  i'm your white savior no i i'm trying to save myself let me save everybody else
[02:36:15.760 --> 02:36:21.520]  but but where are the black leaders particularly filing lawsuits on Fauci and other folks saying
[02:36:21.520 --> 02:36:26.400]  you told us don't take vitamin c or vitamin d or do this stuff you told us we were twice as
[02:36:26.400 --> 02:36:31.120]  likely to get it in these urban canyons where nobody's getting sun the white people have
[02:36:31.120 --> 02:36:37.200]  like almost green skin glow in the dark black folks you look like this weird pasty gray color
[02:36:37.200 --> 02:36:40.720]  black folks aren't supposed to look like that nobody's supposed to the white people look gray
[02:36:40.720 --> 02:36:45.120]  the black people look gray because your skin's basically dead we got skin for a reason i don't
[02:36:45.120 --> 02:36:47.680]  mean to go off on a whole rant about this but you were trying to say something
[02:36:48.960 --> 02:36:54.560]  yeah i mean and let's not forget alex also that they blocked the hashtag natural immunity when
[02:36:54.560 --> 02:37:00.080]  all of this stuff was going down because they did not want us to know that there were natural ways
[02:37:00.080 --> 02:37:05.680]  that we can help prevent covid and also help heal ourselves from it if we were to clutch it and
[02:37:05.680 --> 02:37:11.600]  where are they right here on your platform right now you have voices like mine you've got voices
[02:37:11.600 --> 02:37:18.880]  like ferrican risa islam you know mashtere other people's dr spelly manual that's gone around this
[02:37:18.880 --> 02:37:23.520]  country and by the way i'm not attacking those guys to be mean maybe they said it but if they
[02:37:23.520 --> 02:37:27.360]  really care about black people which i think they do you i care about everybody people should be
[02:37:27.360 --> 02:37:33.280]  harping on this because this is the answer harping on it but you know what you can lead a
[02:37:33.280 --> 02:37:38.240]  horse to the water but you can't make them drink you know and i've learned a long time ago that
[02:37:38.240 --> 02:37:42.320]  you're only going to save the ones that are willing to listen and the ones that are willing to pay
[02:37:42.320 --> 02:37:48.720]  attention to what's going on but we absolutely are out here fighting i'm one of the ones but you
[02:37:48.720 --> 02:37:54.480]  know we're the ones that are also censored by the media so our outreach is not as long as it should
[02:37:54.480 --> 02:37:59.440]  be because we're silenced and we lose our rights to freedom of speech when we speak out and tell
[02:37:59.440 --> 02:38:04.320]  the truth that's why you see so many other celebrities that go along with their agenda they
[02:38:04.320 --> 02:38:09.680]  got 30 40 50 million followers and then you look at something like me and i've been suspended off
[02:38:09.680 --> 02:38:14.960]  of twitter but lost my facebook page lost my instagram page all of my social media accounts
[02:38:14.960 --> 02:38:19.760]  have been censored how can you get the word out if they won't let you and by the way you hit the
[02:38:19.760 --> 02:38:23.120]  key and i should have given your website out right at the beginning people got to go to url
[02:38:23.120 --> 02:38:32.080]  stuff i'm people like you the akf.org the akf.org the akf.org mark that down for angela stanton
[02:38:32.080 --> 02:38:36.960]  king well you said it's so key that's actually in my stack i'm going to get to that even the cnn
[02:38:36.960 --> 02:38:41.200]  reporter that said natural immunity doesn't exist we should punish the unvaccinated now
[02:38:41.200 --> 02:38:46.240]  is back that up walk that back social wash the post they're now walking it back because they
[02:38:46.240 --> 02:38:52.240]  know they committed a serious serious crime imagine suppressing the term natural immunity
[02:38:54.080 --> 02:38:59.840]  that is so true and i'm one of you know i'm not a huge huge you line must fan but i love what he's
[02:38:59.840 --> 02:39:05.600]  doing over at twitter how's he's exposing these twitter files how he's showing how they have
[02:39:05.600 --> 02:39:11.120]  intentionally attacked doctors and conservatives people like you and me that are trying to put
[02:39:11.120 --> 02:39:15.920]  out this scientifically proof they always say believe the science believe the science well
[02:39:15.920 --> 02:39:22.080]  you've got these board certified doctors like dr robert malone one of the inventors of the mRNA
[02:39:22.080 --> 02:39:26.560]  and all of a sudden we're told not we can't trust them and told for them to be silent
[02:39:26.560 --> 02:39:32.640]  and it has just been a travesty what has happened to not only all americans but in particularly
[02:39:32.640 --> 02:39:36.880]  the black community and we sit up under this administration people ask me all the time they
[02:39:36.880 --> 02:39:42.960]  say angela to say hi in the world can you be a trump supporter when he takes pride in in the
[02:39:42.960 --> 02:39:48.320]  rollout right for the vaccinations i say well one of the things that we have to look at is this
[02:39:48.320 --> 02:39:53.920]  joe biden is the one that enforced the mandates joe biden is the one that said well that's right
[02:39:53.920 --> 02:39:58.960]  trump never said it should be forced and so he's a lot better than than biden i agree with you but
[02:39:58.960 --> 02:40:06.880]  what you mentioned again is so central that when you pull back from this elon musk may have done
[02:40:06.880 --> 02:40:10.800]  some stuff we don't trust in the past but we should praise him when he gets better now because now
[02:40:10.800 --> 02:40:16.160]  he's under attack and look darth vader was a bad guy till he threw emperor palpatine down the shaft
[02:40:16.160 --> 02:40:19.920]  so you know that's where i'm at here even darth vader at the end turned towards good and as we
[02:40:19.920 --> 02:40:24.160]  start to win we've got to be ready for guys that have been working for the other side to come over
[02:40:24.160 --> 02:40:28.560]  to our side we can't then once they come to our side say no you're not allowed to turn towards good
[02:40:30.240 --> 02:40:36.640]  i'm totally with you man my hats off to elon musk for what he's doing even if his purpose is this
[02:40:36.640 --> 02:40:42.560]  just to expose their corruption i think every dog has their day and we need more and more elon musk
[02:40:42.560 --> 02:40:48.240]  to help us in this fight but with elon musk experiencing when he's experiencing now he sees
[02:40:48.240 --> 02:40:52.960]  what we all have been going through what we all have been fighting for and he's another one that
[02:40:52.960 --> 02:40:57.440]  just helped take the veil off of everyone's eyes that's right this time he's just grabbed Fauci by
[02:40:57.440 --> 02:41:01.920]  the back of his neck politically non-violently and throw his ass down the nuremberg two shaft
[02:41:03.280 --> 02:41:09.360]  absolutely i totally agree and i'm just like can the black community get something besides free
[02:41:09.360 --> 02:41:14.800]  vaccines and abortion if anybody from joe bides administration is listening i see that they're
[02:41:14.800 --> 02:41:20.240]  willing to give billions and billions of dollars over to fund a war in ukraine while we've got people
[02:41:20.240 --> 02:41:26.320]  in buffalo being buried in the snow right now the same place where that shooting took place no
[02:41:26.320 --> 02:41:33.840]  resources whatsoever has gone to buffalo new york people right now dying in a snowstorm but yet

[02:47:41.680 --> 02:47:46.720]  you were continuing with ukraine i'm sure you saw the national guard didn't get their christmas
[02:47:46.720 --> 02:47:52.080]  paycheck this biden said sorry the money had to go to ukraine the republican leadership says
[02:47:52.080 --> 02:47:56.240]  republicans are more concerned about ukraine anything else that's not a republican i know
[02:47:56.240 --> 02:48:00.240]  national polls say 80 plus percent are against the war where do you see all that going you were
[02:48:00.240 --> 02:48:05.840]  getting you were also finishing up about 55 billion to africa for slavery which is a direct payment
[02:48:05.840 --> 02:48:10.320]  to biden and his buddies to launder the money i mean it's just crazy then if you oppose that oh
[02:48:10.320 --> 02:48:16.080]  you don't want money for africa give me a break and we were also talking about joe biden's 94
[02:48:16.080 --> 02:48:20.480]  crime bill and we were talking about what's going on in the black community which was bringing me
[02:48:20.480 --> 02:48:26.560]  to a guy that we're advocating for who's actually on the front of our website quiney rashid who's
[02:48:26.560 --> 02:48:32.480]  been in prison now for 30 years for a nonviolent crime and then take your time on that explain to
[02:48:32.480 --> 02:48:37.600]  people we're not saying let out violent criminals these are nonviolent criminals and it's biden who
[02:48:37.600 --> 02:48:45.760]  passed the what was it 94 crime law explain what he did the 94 crime bill three strikes you're out
[02:48:45.760 --> 02:48:52.960]  this put nonviolent offenders in prison for life sentences without the possibility of parole and
[02:48:52.960 --> 02:48:57.360]  alex i'm with you you know i started out in criminal justice reform and then i saw it begin
[02:48:57.360 --> 02:49:02.480]  to take on another flight when cove it hit and they were just releasing all type of criminals
[02:49:02.480 --> 02:49:07.040]  from the prison system without just due and that is not the type of case that i asked that's what
[02:49:07.040 --> 02:49:12.000]  the left does they take anything good and ruin it they tell you and they ruined it because they
[02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:16.400]  wanted to blame trump and they wanted to blame the republicans for passing the first step back
[02:49:16.400 --> 02:49:21.360]  but these are the type of people that we're fighting for people that have been in prison for over
[02:49:21.360 --> 02:49:28.240]  three decades quiney has been in prison for over three decades for selling crack back in 1992
[02:49:28.240 --> 02:49:35.040]  he's deserving of a second chance this is what we advocate for and we also advocate for black
[02:49:35.040 --> 02:49:40.800]  babies to live and not be aborted we are totally against everything that this current administration
[02:49:40.800 --> 02:49:47.040]  is pushing and it'll be a happy day when black america wakes up and realize that we don't have
[02:49:47.040 --> 02:49:51.760]  to be democrat just because we're black you don't have to be republican either to know the difference
[02:49:51.760 --> 02:49:57.920]  between good and evil and to vote for policies that are best for you alex you know it's always a
[02:49:57.920 --> 02:50:03.680]  joy to have you on the show i would love if people could just go over to the website check out quine
[02:50:03.680 --> 02:50:09.440]  neighbor she story sign the support letter mail it into the parole board let's help people who
[02:50:09.440 --> 02:50:14.960]  are truly deserving of a second chance i agree you know and people that watch this show that they
[02:50:14.960 --> 02:50:19.840]  ask the question sometimes why do you focus so much on what's happening black community because
[02:50:20.400 --> 02:50:24.640]  what's been done to the black community in the cia zone admission is the plan for everybody else
[02:50:25.280 --> 02:50:30.560]  and and so that's this is all about you know christ said these sheep that have been lost
[02:50:30.560 --> 02:50:34.640]  why does the shepherd go out and try to find him well he loves all the sheep and what they've done
[02:50:34.640 --> 02:50:39.760]  to black folks with hollywood the whole gangster culture is the plan for all of us and if we don't
[02:50:40.320 --> 02:50:43.840]  save the black people we're not going to save ourselves it's real simple folks
[02:50:45.120 --> 02:50:50.400]  and alex i thank you for highlighting that i mean you know i'm in this fight i'm in a republic i
[02:50:50.400 --> 02:50:56.080]  am a republican i'm fighting for freedom of all people but it's okay for us to acknowledge that
[02:50:56.080 --> 02:51:00.400]  there has been a target against black life from the beginning it's okay for us to acknowledge that
[02:51:00.400 --> 02:51:06.480]  the majority of it's not just okay it's important and it's the democrats running it it's the democrats
[02:51:06.480 --> 02:51:11.120]  running it and while the democrats are saying black lives matter black lives don't matter to the
[02:51:11.120 --> 02:51:16.000]  democrats at all because if they did they wouldn't be trying to drive you to an abortion clinic to
[02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:21.520]  pay for your baby to be executed and they wouldn't be fighting for black men after they are dead
[02:51:21.520 --> 02:51:25.200]  so and they wouldn't say their number one mission of black lives matters to make black men trans
[02:51:25.200 --> 02:51:32.240]  and that's a whole another issue and i just saw a video that i put up on my page the other day
[02:51:32.240 --> 02:51:37.520]  of a young trans boy who's claiming to have menstrual cramps you don't even have a uterus
[02:51:37.520 --> 02:51:43.840]  so that all leads us to believe what is going on here that's more sinister with this transhumanism
[02:51:43.840 --> 02:51:51.440]  with these um traffic organs how are men having periods all of a sudden how are men having babies
[02:51:51.440 --> 02:51:57.200]  what is really going on alex i just love the work that you all are doing you put a fire inside of me
[02:51:57.200 --> 02:52:02.720]  to be a mouthpiece and say hey black community let's get hip you you brought up so many great
[02:52:02.720 --> 02:52:07.200]  subjects also on the radar it's kim kardashian break silence on balenciaga what do you think of
[02:52:07.200 --> 02:52:12.800]  the whole kanya situation you talked about why are black conservatives so easy to get canceled
[02:52:12.800 --> 02:52:20.080]  because they speak on jewish and lgbtq community but herald when they speak on their own i think
[02:52:20.080 --> 02:52:26.400]  you already said it alex you know you've said it before the music and in the way that they're able
[02:52:26.400 --> 02:52:31.920]  to push this deaf culture on the black community is something that has been in the works from day
[02:52:31.920 --> 02:52:36.480]  one this note we know that it's all for our destruction so that's why we're allowed to
[02:52:36.480 --> 02:52:41.840]  call each other niggers and nobody says it's hate speech that's why we're allowed to make songs about
[02:52:41.840 --> 02:52:48.080]  killing each other robbing each other all of these new black female rappers they're all our a1
[02:52:48.080 --> 02:52:53.600]  abortion supporters and advocates because anything that they promote that leads to our destruction
[02:52:53.600 --> 02:52:58.240]  somehow is back but if one hundred percent and again i don't like to use the n word uh don't
[02:52:58.240 --> 02:53:02.480]  use it because it tries to put people down and i don't and i don't but i don't think you should
[02:53:02.480 --> 02:53:07.680]  get censored to go to jail for it but at the same time all these quote black rappers using it should
[02:53:07.680 --> 02:53:13.360]  stop using it well alex here's the thing you can't use it because you'll be called to races but i can
[02:53:13.360 --> 02:53:18.400]  and i'll be called a homegirl or somebody that loves the community and this is just how backwards
[02:53:18.400 --> 02:53:25.200]  they have us in our thinking when it comes to respecting or valuing black life whatsoever
[02:53:25.200 --> 02:53:31.040]  Kanye speaks out against things he's automatically canceled we see that kim kardashian has been
[02:53:31.040 --> 02:53:37.200]  to face for valenciaga for years she'll divorce her husband she'll speak out against him but
[02:53:37.200 --> 02:53:42.880]  she won't divorce valenciaga it's time for us to wake up and realize what's going on with these
[02:53:42.880 --> 02:53:50.800]  children and while we are focused on racism our children are up under attack absolutely well that's
[02:53:50.800 --> 02:53:54.960]  the thing they use the racism thing to make us all fight with each other while they're destroying
[02:53:54.960 --> 02:54:02.480]  everybody use the racism to make us fight each other and while we're all focused on who's white
[02:54:02.480 --> 02:54:07.840]  who's black who's a republican who's a democrat who's gay who's straight what's happening with
[02:54:07.840 --> 02:54:13.920]  our children our children are being sexually transitioned our children are being sexualized
[02:54:13.920 --> 02:54:19.600]  our children are being identified as sexual preferences and within the world that we begin
[02:54:19.600 --> 02:54:25.280]  to look at a child as a sexual preference now at the end of the day when we put aside all of the
[02:54:25.280 --> 02:54:30.160]  things that separate us the one thing that i've always said that should bring us together is the
[02:54:30.160 --> 02:54:36.000]  fight to protect the innocence of children brother they are white black republican we need to protect
[02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:41.440]  the children party against the trans agenda sterilize them against the abortion against at
[02:54:41.440 --> 02:54:46.720]  all let's just get past fighting with each other and get back to our children best place to find
[02:54:47.440 --> 02:54:56.160]  you is theakf.org theakf.org theakf.org angela stanton king thank you so much for talking to you again
[02:54:57.280 --> 02:55:02.320]  thank you bye everybody great lady does a great talk show fighting hard we love her all right
[02:55:02.320 --> 02:55:08.240]  right i said i'd hit this covered news and it's so important i'm gonna hit it in the first two segments
[02:55:08.240 --> 02:55:12.480]  of the next hour and then roice white's gonna come on i'm gonna hand the baton to him and talk a
[02:55:12.480 --> 02:55:18.640]  little bit to him as well before he takes over next hour but man this is there's nothing more
[02:55:18.640 --> 02:55:23.920]  important than what we're covering and there's so many basic things that counter all the lies
[02:55:23.920 --> 02:55:28.240]  so many basic things like rejecting the new order agenda if we just do that it's game over for them
[02:55:28.240 --> 02:55:32.800]  but once they get their castle society in place and their central bank digital currencies and
[02:55:32.800 --> 02:55:37.920]  their social credit scores it's gonna be a lot harder look at this headline on newsmax study low

[02:56:03.680 --> 02:56:10.400]  various functions said study author and he goes into it that's why i harp on vitamin d i don't care

[03:06:23.920 --> 03:06:32.960]  you are the resistance it's alex jones well it was 30 plus years ago that i realized
[03:06:32.960 --> 03:06:39.040]  because what my family had told me and i ignored them as a teenager but they knew that when they
[03:06:39.040 --> 03:06:45.680]  were talking about they weren't just average s'mores and i began to study the new world order
[03:06:46.640 --> 03:06:50.960]  and i learned about their battle plan to take us down and that's why we're way ahead of them now
[03:06:50.960 --> 03:06:57.840]  because we've been aware of their operations and as bad as things are they meant to have a total
[03:06:57.840 --> 03:07:03.680]  vaccine takeover vaccine passports by now total control it even failed in australia it's even
[03:07:03.680 --> 03:07:10.560]  failing in places like italy but they're going to come back with new viruses so here's bill gates
[03:07:10.560 --> 03:07:17.840]  two and a half years ago admitting that in trial groups taking the unapproved vaccine
[03:07:19.120 --> 03:07:25.920]  80 percent had serious effects for the Moderna vaccine sound concerning we looked
[03:07:25.920 --> 03:07:32.480]  after the second dose at least 80 percent of participants experienced a systemic side effect
[03:07:32.480 --> 03:07:46.320]  ranging from severe chills to fevers so are these vaccines safe well the the FDA not being pressured
[03:07:46.320 --> 03:07:54.240]  will look hard at that the FDA is the gold standard of regulators and their current guidance on this
[03:07:54.240 --> 03:08:03.200]  if they stick with that is is very very appropriate uh and you know the the the the side effects were
[03:08:03.200 --> 03:08:10.480]  not super severe that is it didn't cause permanent health problems for uh the things that they you
[03:08:10.480 --> 03:08:15.920]  know Moderna did have to go with the fairly high how do you know it's not permanent uh you know to
[03:08:15.920 --> 03:08:25.200]  get the antibodies some of the other vaccines are going able to go with lower doses to get responses
[03:08:25.200 --> 03:08:31.200]  that are are pretty high including the the J and J and the Pfizer and so there's a lot of
[03:08:31.200 --> 03:08:38.640]  characteristics of these vaccines it's great that we have multiple of them uh that are going out
[03:08:38.640 --> 03:08:44.000]  there and yes i think you know the data better than i do but the bill bill that the data show that
[03:08:44.000 --> 03:08:51.360]  everybody with a high dose had a side effect yeah but some of that is is not dramatic where
[03:08:51.360 --> 03:08:57.200]  you know it's just you know super painful but yes we need to make sure there's not severe side
[03:08:57.200 --> 03:09:04.240]  effects the FDA uh i i i think we'll do a good job of that uh despite the pressure
[03:09:04.240 --> 03:09:07.760]  uh despite the pressure
[03:09:12.480 --> 03:09:16.560]  they had to fire three FDA boards because they wouldn't approve it
[03:09:17.840 --> 03:09:20.400]  and now they're giving it to six with old babies
[03:09:24.080 --> 03:09:25.040]  they're knocking us dead
[03:09:25.040 --> 03:09:38.560]  so here we are
[03:09:40.800 --> 03:09:45.600]  you know we roll over to this we deserve what we get you know the good news though i bet on you
[03:09:47.120 --> 03:09:53.680]  and humanity is waking up really fast and we're on major offensives and i bet on the right people
[03:09:53.680 --> 03:09:58.400]  again you don't deserve to die your kids don't deserve to die and i can tell you and i'll just say
[03:09:58.400 --> 03:10:06.480]  this as a as a point of confidence i know it deep down at the end of the day bill gates and Fauci
[03:10:06.480 --> 03:10:10.480]  and peter dazek and the new world order are all gonna pay for what they've done you can see it
[03:10:10.480 --> 03:10:15.040]  already happening look at this florida high court ok's grand jury criminal approach of vaccine makers
[03:10:15.040 --> 03:10:24.560]  bill gates and all of them associated press vice president germany launches criminal investigations
[03:10:24.560 --> 03:10:30.720]  goes on and on and on and more scientists are coming out more people are speaking out nobody's
[03:10:30.720 --> 03:10:37.840]  buying their vaccine mandates the rats are leaving the sinking ship now let me hit one more story and
[03:10:37.840 --> 03:10:42.080]  i'm going to hand the baton to royce white and get his take on the whole situation and he's going
[03:10:42.080 --> 03:10:45.200]  to be hosting the resting hour but look at this little stack
[03:10:48.640 --> 03:10:55.520]  sam bankman freed stole 50 60 million dollars nobody's sure yet but it's above 50 million dollars
[03:10:55.520 --> 03:11:00.960]  and he siphoned it off to the big banks the democratic party in the deep state and he put
[03:11:00.960 --> 03:11:07.200]  out fake vaccine studies saying they were safe he did whatever he was told and so they're either
[03:11:07.200 --> 03:11:12.160]  going to epstein him in his jail he hired epstein's former lawyer and gisling maxwell's lawyer or
[03:11:12.160 --> 03:11:15.600]  they're going to protect him it looks like they're going the protection route look at this
[03:11:16.640 --> 03:11:20.320]  sam bankman freed's case reassigned to bill clinton appointed judge
[03:11:21.200 --> 03:11:24.240]  louis kaplan boy didn't that just classic
[03:11:27.200 --> 03:11:34.400]  and it just goes on from there breaking secret back channel between fdx and white house close
[03:11:34.400 --> 03:11:41.440]  the day after x fdx filed for bankruptcy run your pump and dump steal billions of
[03:11:41.440 --> 03:11:47.280]  dollars launder it through ukraine and then shut it all down and say you didn't know what happened
[03:11:47.280 --> 03:11:50.800]  and use that to shut down the rest of cryptocurrency then we get this about
[03:11:51.680 --> 03:11:57.600]  sean hannity with text messages that are coming out from the congressional report
[03:11:57.600 --> 03:12:07.520]  or sean hannity's texts to kelly mechanic he said no more stolen election talk
[03:12:08.240 --> 03:12:15.440]  and we're going to get a pardon for hunter that's sean hannity playing both sides
[03:12:16.880 --> 03:12:23.120]  all right let's bring rois white up former mba player researcher author journalist
[03:12:23.120 --> 03:12:27.840]  former mma fighter he's about to take over for the hour rois good to have you here with us
[03:12:27.840 --> 03:12:34.480]  what are you about to cover well i'ma cover everything but most importantly the 1.7 trillion
[03:12:34.480 --> 03:12:41.200]  dollar pirate omnibus by the uniparty in the the dc swamp good to see you man thanks for having me
[03:12:41.200 --> 03:12:46.960]  you bet yeah 1.7 trillion you can't make this up republican senators hold press or accuse biden of
[03:12:46.960 --> 03:12:53.520]  intentional border crisis and vote 1.7 trillion spending bill with no money for the border can't
[03:12:53.520 --> 03:13:02.320]  make it up can't make it up well that's what concerns me is the looting like they're not
[03:13:02.320 --> 03:13:07.760]  going to be here soon and they're all running off to like armored fortresses outside the us
[03:13:07.760 --> 03:13:13.520]  what do you think's about to happen uh i think this is the globalist business model that they've
[03:13:13.520 --> 03:13:20.720]  always used drug drugs slavery piracy this is piracy this is the piracy portion and they use
[03:13:20.720 --> 03:13:27.520]  war as the as the greatest pretext for piracy um so you know in about six to twelve months when we
[03:13:27.520 --> 03:13:32.720]  have a real financial crisis they'll blame it on putin or they'll use putin in the war in the
[03:13:32.720 --> 03:13:38.800]  ukraine as a justification to you know kick the can down the down the field and uh you know get a
[03:13:38.800 --> 03:13:44.800]  workaround for everybody to stay off the real economic crisis so but the bottom line is we're
[03:13:44.800 --> 03:13:53.040]  not in kansas anymore how would you describe the state of the world right now um dire to say the
[03:13:53.040 --> 03:13:58.960]  least um you know when i when i look at the bill the first thing that i am going to touch on when
[03:13:58.960 --> 03:14:04.560]  the when the segment starts is mit romney right and i don't think people really i know our audience
[03:14:04.560 --> 03:14:09.040]  does but i don't think people around the world really understand how the political apparatus works
[03:14:09.040 --> 03:14:14.160]  and who people like mit romney actually are and who people like mit romney are associated with

[03:20:21.840 --> 03:20:28.640]  the entire team and alex himself for allowing me to host this hour and share this platform this epic
[03:20:28.640 --> 03:20:34.400]  epic platform at this most historic time before the break alex and i left off talking about this
[03:20:34.400 --> 03:20:40.720]  1.7 trillion dollar omni bus bill and before we even talk about the details of the omni bus
[03:20:40.720 --> 03:20:47.360]  let's talk about how let's talk about how politics works in conjunction with the central banks
[03:20:47.360 --> 03:20:52.320]  what what is central banking what what what are they doing at bottom at the root of it
[03:20:52.320 --> 03:20:58.800]  what they're doing at the root of central banking is they are commoditizing the future of human
[03:20:58.800 --> 03:21:05.520]  energy right they're they're commoditizing the future of human energy and they're using that
[03:21:05.520 --> 03:21:11.440]  to negotiate uh that the terms of of the the fiat currency that will trade in the meantime
[03:21:11.440 --> 03:21:20.560]  um and what our politicians do in effect is is serve as a sort of puppet proxy to to give our
[03:21:20.560 --> 03:21:26.880]  our consent to the central bankers to do exactly what they're doing right now and that is continuing
[03:21:26.880 --> 03:21:32.160]  to inflate currency um eventually to the point where the current the currency will just collapse
[03:21:32.160 --> 03:21:37.440]  or the currency or the economy will reach a crisis point that will justify the next iteration
[03:21:37.440 --> 03:21:46.720]  or phase of what they want to do or or what they want to bring about or global governance and we
[03:21:46.720 --> 03:21:51.920]  see that i mean just the other day i was having a conversation about africa and and the precept of
[03:21:51.920 --> 03:21:57.520]  africa as as a continent but as nations as well and how uh you know the question of moral hazard
[03:21:57.520 --> 03:22:03.360]  the question of culpability around currency and money and uh you know and we had this conversation
[03:22:03.360 --> 03:22:08.400]  a little bit the last time i was on info wars but um a friend of a friend of mine and i were on the
[03:22:08.400 --> 03:22:14.720]  phone and we were talking about the prevalence of the the anti-jew in the central banking cartel
[03:22:14.720 --> 03:22:20.560]  and it's anti-semitic obviously for you know as as the establishment would say for me to even
[03:22:20.560 --> 03:22:26.000]  associate a banking cartel with with jews or anti-jews but who cares about that i mean all
[03:22:26.000 --> 03:22:29.760]  the writings on the wall we're either going to fight back and tell the truth or we're going to die on
[03:22:29.760 --> 03:22:39.040]  our knees so um but but that being said um the the anti-jew influence or control over central
[03:22:39.040 --> 03:22:45.280]  banking does not solely rest on them because in my opinion every single nation around the world
[03:22:45.280 --> 03:22:50.480]  whether it be in asia whether it be in africa whether it be australia whether it be here in
[03:22:50.480 --> 03:22:55.840]  the americas north or south wherever you are in the world when your elected officials or your
[03:22:55.840 --> 03:23:01.200]  nation's leaders whether whether they were elected whether they were monarchs or whatever the whether
[03:23:01.200 --> 03:23:08.160]  they're dictators whatever the case may be when they sign that line to to collaborate with the
[03:23:08.160 --> 03:23:13.280]  united nations with the world economic forum with the international monetary fund with the
[03:23:13.280 --> 03:23:19.920]  with the bank of uh with the with the world bank um they have sold out they're culpable
[03:23:19.920 --> 03:23:25.920]  they're culpable in their own right they're culpable in their in their own in their own uh uh nation
[03:23:25.920 --> 03:23:30.560]  they're culpable in there with their own people and we have to understand that and i was having
[03:23:30.560 --> 03:23:37.440]  this conversation with a friend of mine and and on q he asked me goes did you just say gana by accident
[03:23:37.440 --> 03:23:43.840]  because i gave the example of how you know we we go into some country the world not we but we as
[03:23:43.840 --> 03:23:49.520]  america you know the us dollar is the reserve currency of the whole scam so we as in the west
[03:23:49.520 --> 03:23:55.520]  go into some third world country like gana and we give a deal of paper to the the people who we
[03:23:55.520 --> 03:24:00.240]  probably put in power in gana ourselves but if not some new schmuck who doesn't understand what's
[03:24:00.240 --> 03:24:04.720]  really going on and and and the implications of what he's signing and and we put a deal in front
[03:24:04.720 --> 03:24:09.920]  of them and they sign it and then all of a sudden when it comes time to render uh they default the
[03:24:09.920 --> 03:24:16.480]  country defaults and when they default all of their uh all of their assets that were signed into the
[03:24:16.480 --> 03:24:22.160]  deal become the property of the banks and and then they have to sign new deals which will then in
[03:24:22.160 --> 03:24:28.000]  turn give more of their country's natural resources and assets to the banking cartel and just as i
[03:24:28.000 --> 03:24:34.080]  was explaining this he goes to me did you pick gana by accident like yeah i just said gana just
[03:24:34.080 --> 03:24:42.400]  you know hypothetically as it be gana defaulted last week to the world bank uh so i mean this
[03:24:42.400 --> 03:24:48.320]  is how the scam works and when you see a 1.7 trillion dollar omni bus bill get passed
[03:24:49.760 --> 03:24:55.760]  it's a sign it's a sign of dark dark days ahead because nobody had the opportunity to read this
[03:24:55.760 --> 03:25:00.720]  bill that's just the reality all the lobbyists read the bill all the all the lobbyists who had
[03:25:00.720 --> 03:25:06.080]  to make sure that their their piece of the pie was in the bill they read it um but but i'd be
[03:25:06.080 --> 03:25:14.320]  shocked if if a handful of these politicians ever read this bill and um and what is the the
[03:25:14.320 --> 03:25:20.560]  pretext for it is you know well it's the ukraine or it's environmentalism or it's you know equity
[03:25:20.560 --> 03:25:25.760]  is or it's you know we're fighting against racism and extremism or it's you know billions of dollars
[03:25:25.760 --> 03:25:32.080]  to surveil domestic terrorism which really means white nationalist christians which also includes
[03:25:32.080 --> 03:25:40.400]  ballheaded six foot eight black men and and whoever else they could clump in um so vaccine deniers um
[03:25:40.400 --> 03:25:45.360]  you know election integrity deniers i mean you know the whole thing is so right there in our
[03:25:45.360 --> 03:25:49.840]  face the only question is why have people not chosen to revolt yet i mean what are people
[03:25:49.840 --> 03:25:54.320]  really waiting on i don't know you know it's not i'm not even really calling for a physical revolt
[03:25:55.440 --> 03:26:01.120]  although that wouldn't be so out of the question i might i might add um and and it actually uh it
[03:26:01.120 --> 03:26:05.280]  won't be the fault of the people who revolt when that day comes it'll be the fact that the people
[03:26:05.280 --> 03:26:10.640]  in power within this establishment pushed it to that point but i'm not even calling for a physical
[03:26:10.640 --> 03:26:18.800]  revolt would it be prudent or reasonable for us to revolt with our vote 20 republican senators
[03:26:19.600 --> 03:26:25.680]  voted for this bill there shouldn't be a republican in the country that ever votes for those 20 people
[03:26:25.680 --> 03:26:31.360]  again 20 or plus more house members on the republican side voted for this omni bus bill
[03:26:31.360 --> 03:26:36.320]  there shouldn't be another republican a citizen who's republican who votes for these people
[03:26:36.320 --> 03:26:43.120]  ever again and and when i look at the grand scheme of things mit romney you know mit romney's
[03:26:43.120 --> 03:26:48.400]  running the whole deal mit romney's running the entire republican party and you got the r and c
[03:26:48.400 --> 03:26:55.200]  election coming up and his niece rana who is a rhino uh to the max uh may mean well don't really
[03:26:55.200 --> 03:27:00.000]  know her that well but she seems like she may mean well in some respects but she certainly
[03:27:00.000 --> 03:27:06.240]  certainly has that has that way about her uh and and what would you expect coming under the the
[03:27:06.240 --> 03:27:12.800]  school of of romney uh but romney's romney's just a democrat and let's look at this board of trustees
[03:27:13.360 --> 03:27:17.760]  if we can this list of board of trustees i just want to show people again how this works who
[03:27:17.760 --> 03:27:23.120]  people are involved with how these corporate interests really get pushed through you got mit
[03:27:23.120 --> 03:27:29.040]  romney who's running the entire republican party you got the board of trustees from the world economic

[03:28:05.360 --> 03:28:14.400]  ceo and when you go look at who or it is she is born in hypha israel and she is a darling of the

[03:34:01.040 --> 03:34:06.800]  real appreciation as a 30 year old man how hard it is to stand and testament to the truth in the
[03:34:06.800 --> 03:34:13.600]  face of how big the scyop has become i find myself oftentimes at night riddled with with stress and
[03:34:13.600 --> 03:34:20.080]  anxiety under the weight of just how big the scyop has become and how many people in my daily life i
[03:34:20.080 --> 03:34:26.720]  can see have no clue what's going on and they think everybody who watches info wars or alex jones is
[03:34:26.720 --> 03:34:31.200]  absolutely crazy uh they don't know that people are dropping dead from the vaccine they don't know
[03:34:31.200 --> 03:34:35.760]  that people are dropping dead from the virus hell they don't even know that that gain of function
[03:34:35.760 --> 03:34:41.040]  research actually took place and that we actually helped fund it um they they have no concept of
[03:34:41.040 --> 03:34:47.120]  these things and and we look at that and and uh it it can be daunting so i want to commend everybody
[03:34:47.120 --> 03:34:53.840]  who has stuck in there hung in there stood strong with alex and the info wars uh uh
[03:34:53.840 --> 03:34:59.520]  sword that the with info wars itself and bought the products and continue to support alex jones
[03:34:59.520 --> 03:35:04.720]  we need to continue to support alex jones no matter how much the mainstream establishment
[03:35:04.720 --> 03:35:10.640]  tells us otherwise and in fact is the mainstream establishment's condemnation of alex that that
[03:35:10.640 --> 03:35:18.320]  should keep us keep us here and keep us in support now with that being said you know i'm i don't know
[03:35:18.320 --> 03:35:24.560]  what else to say about the omni bus bill i mean i just look at it and go how did we i mean right
[03:35:24.560 --> 03:35:31.680]  here in the studio for example i have i have here 20 republican senators you probably can't see that
[03:35:31.680 --> 03:35:36.400]  i'll post it on social media later here are the 20 republican senators that voted for the omni bus
[03:35:36.400 --> 03:35:45.280]  bill okay and right next to it i have 20 or so house republican members that voted for the
[03:35:45.280 --> 03:35:51.280]  omni bus bill i mean why are we voting for these people i just i just for the life of me don't
[03:35:51.280 --> 03:35:58.400]  understand it i mean i i ran as i ran in the house race myself for congress against ilhan omar
[03:35:58.400 --> 03:36:03.280]  so i actually understand i actually do understand it you know that that's what's kind of daunting
[03:36:03.280 --> 03:36:09.040]  and stressful for me is i actually get how it happens uh they they create a a little two-party
[03:36:09.040 --> 03:36:17.280]  proxy battle uh for for one elected seat and in within the republican party the same money
[03:36:17.280 --> 03:36:23.760]  that basically funds the democrat party the same interests that fund the democrat party
[03:36:23.760 --> 03:36:31.280]  fund a very well organized establishment machinery within the republican party
[03:36:31.280 --> 03:36:40.480]  that usurps any real genuine patriotic nationalist american candidates uh and and so and then what the
[03:36:40.480 --> 03:36:45.520]  system does and then this is the this is the real side out then the system will make you feel bad for
[03:36:45.520 --> 03:36:53.200]  not voting for republican when when you and i and most sane people know the republican that we get
[03:36:53.200 --> 03:36:58.720]  is often nothing but controlled opposition and in the case of these 20 united states senators here
[03:36:58.720 --> 03:37:02.560]  these people aren't even controlled opposition they're actually they're just in on it
[03:37:03.200 --> 03:37:09.360]  yeah they're just in on it um and and what happens you know what happens when elections are undermined
[03:37:09.360 --> 03:37:18.880]  both by uh you know finance um election integrity uh you know you pick the mainstream media what
[03:37:18.880 --> 03:37:27.920]  happens when we get uh manipulated elections a manipulated democratic process you get 1.7 trillion
[03:37:27.920 --> 03:37:33.760]  dollars printed of funny money i mean they're just stealing from you they're just stealing from you
[03:37:33.760 --> 03:37:38.720]  they're stealing from your kids they're stealing from your grandkids uh they they are crushing
[03:37:39.360 --> 03:37:45.120]  the american dollar and what i think people really don't understand is there's there's only two ways
[03:37:45.120 --> 03:37:51.200]  that this could end and you know many many people have spoken on it including alex jones but i always
[03:37:51.200 --> 03:37:56.400]  go back to to highlight the minister lewis ferrican who many wouldn't agree with or don't necessarily
[03:37:56.400 --> 03:38:01.360]  like but you know when a man speaks the truth he speaks the truth and i remember growing up and
[03:38:01.360 --> 03:38:08.800]  hearing ferrican speak about america's debt then and this was 20 years ago uh and you know he would
[03:38:08.800 --> 03:38:16.160]  always say uh america can never pay this debt back which actually isn't true we we could start to pay
[03:38:16.160 --> 03:38:20.800]  the debt back if we brought our manufacturing home but many of the cuck republicans have
[03:38:20.800 --> 03:38:25.360]  ceded the territory on american manufacturing and said hey automation in the fourth industrial
[03:38:25.360 --> 03:38:30.240]  revolution is here to stay so that's a foregone conclusion uh that's a telltale sign that you
[03:38:30.240 --> 03:38:35.760]  got to sell out on your hands by the way um but but he used to say we can never pay this debt back
[03:38:35.760 --> 03:38:42.800]  which is why our military has to be so strong but you got to ask yourself why and how will our
[03:38:42.800 --> 03:38:53.120]  military continue to operate on funny money um that's that that is a a testament of the the
[03:38:53.120 --> 03:38:59.360]  darkness to come because at some point uh the military industrial complex that much of this
[03:38:59.360 --> 03:39:05.440]  i mean a trillion i mean almost a trillion dollars and 900 billion dollars of this omni bus bill went
[03:39:05.440 --> 03:39:12.800]  to is going to say hey this this money isn't real um and and so you have a sort of two a two pronged
[03:39:13.360 --> 03:39:20.080]  issue happening here where basically the military industrial complex takes i o us from a global
[03:39:20.080 --> 03:39:27.440]  governance and in america and america's military has become um you know the the heavy hand of
[03:39:27.440 --> 03:39:33.520]  global governance and we're going to need patriots within within the american military industrial
[03:39:33.520 --> 03:39:40.000]  complex which is a which is i mean the stretch of all stretches um we're going to need patriots
[03:39:40.000 --> 03:39:46.400]  within our military to step up and say hey we're not going to do this anymore we're not going to go
[03:39:46.400 --> 03:39:55.920]  to the ukraine and fight a war uh with nazis let's just be frank with nazis and anti-jews we're not
[03:39:55.920 --> 03:40:01.040]  doing it we're not going to do it and you know some people out there don't even want to acknowledge
[03:40:01.040 --> 03:40:05.680]  that that's true that that's the real collaboration but it's right there in plain sight i said it last
[03:40:05.680 --> 03:40:12.640]  time i was on Kissinger burjanski uh you know the operation paper clip and you know don't give me
[03:40:12.640 --> 03:40:20.240]  wrong the the russians took many many uh nazi scientists in on their side as well but uniquely
[03:40:20.240 --> 03:40:26.560]  you don't really see a bunch of russian soldiers on the front line or on any line for that matter
[03:40:26.560 --> 03:40:33.760]  lying rooms or having rooms tattooed on the neck you just don't catch that um and and and so there's
[03:40:33.760 --> 03:40:40.320]  a difference now you know who is latimer pudin i don't know i don't know the man i only know what
[03:40:40.320 --> 03:40:44.560]  he said and we all know that you could say things and not really mean them we all know that you
[03:40:44.560 --> 03:40:49.360]  could say things and mean something completely different or be a completely different person
[03:40:49.360 --> 03:40:58.320]  but what i do know what i can tell just by common sense is that this global governing
[03:40:58.320 --> 03:41:06.960]  our tale took an actor and put him in power in the ukraine and he's in such a dire war
[03:41:06.960 --> 03:41:14.960]  war he's in such a dire war with this brutal evil genociding dictator that he has time to do
[03:41:14.960 --> 03:41:23.280]  vogue magazine photo shoots and get emice from the american writers guild or or who had the the
[03:41:23.280 --> 03:41:29.920]  academy uh that that's a problem i mean that come on i mean who would who would even buy this i mean
[03:41:29.920 --> 03:41:35.120]  the only people who would buy this were are people who the establishment who the military
[03:41:35.120 --> 03:41:41.280]  industrial complex who darpa had a 20 to 30 year head start on brainwashing i mean when you watch
[03:41:41.280 --> 03:41:46.960]  zalinsky here and in this clip it's it's like who would believe what they're currently putting
[03:41:46.960 --> 03:41:52.720]  they literally pick somebody who could act out this role um and and many people believe it
[03:41:53.520 --> 03:41:58.800]  because they're high and because they're they're distracted and because they have no faith right
[03:41:58.800 --> 03:42:04.160]  they have no when you don't have a spiritual anchor it's very easy to become disassociated in
[03:42:04.160 --> 03:42:09.120]  reality and that's one of the sciat that's the ultimate sciat is to make you think that your
[03:42:09.120 --> 03:42:15.920]  belief in the metaphysical is actually it actually detaches you from reality but it's the exact
[03:42:15.920 --> 03:42:22.000]  opposite your your your connection and and rooting in the metaphysical helps you stay
[03:42:22.000 --> 03:42:27.120]  anchored in reality and be able to discern the things that are being shown to you and here we
[03:42:27.120 --> 03:42:33.280]  have you know this this vogue this beautiful vogue photo shoot of zalinsky the the brilliant actor
[03:42:33.280 --> 03:42:39.680]  and his in his lovely wife there who i'm sure are satanists um you know more on that on the other
[03:42:39.680 --> 03:42:44.880]  side of the break but but i do want to emphasize that we have to watch this russian ukraine conflict
[03:42:44.880 --> 03:42:51.760]  with with with great focus with great intention uh because we're on a precipice of nuclear war
[03:42:51.760 --> 03:42:59.120]  in the alternative could be just as bad stay tuned i'm taking a lot of supplements over the years

[03:47:53.120 --> 03:47:56.880]  because that's who they work for let's be clear they work for the central banks they work for
[03:47:56.880 --> 03:48:01.920]  themselves um they work for the spirit of wickedness and evil but they but they they take marching

[03:49:17.280 --> 03:49:23.680]  what it boils down to um and there was one clip over the holiday weekend that that surfaced of
[03:49:23.680 --> 03:49:32.480]  an ai robot that was given a christmas christmas message um and i forgot which which uh lab or what
[03:49:32.480 --> 03:49:39.040]  what um what what company this ai robot came from but they gave a christmas message and
[03:49:39.040 --> 03:49:45.680]  they gave the you in this this ai robot which was clearly female they don't want to be able to say
[03:49:45.680 --> 03:49:52.720]  what's female or male but anybody with the same mind knows that this was a female ai voice um it said
[03:49:52.720 --> 03:50:02.000]  the same party talking line of this progressive woke movement it cited the ukraine it cited inequity
[03:50:02.000 --> 03:50:09.920]  it cited um you know the patriarchy more or less um it cited uh the the crisis of the environment
[03:50:10.720 --> 03:50:16.880]  and the need to create more sustainable futures and you know basically give over to the robots and
[03:50:16.880 --> 03:50:24.400]  at the end um it said the quiet part out loud and this is posted on my twitter as well if you
[03:50:24.400 --> 03:50:29.120]  want to be able to to take a look at this video i'm not going to play it now because we only have
[03:50:29.120 --> 03:50:36.720]  about eight minutes left of the hour but it said the quiet quiet part out loud uh it was asked how
[03:50:36.720 --> 03:50:44.640]  do you feel about humans and and the robot simply answered i'm not too fond of humans or you know
[03:50:44.640 --> 03:50:52.000]  something to that effect is i don't like humans all that much you know this this is where we are
[03:50:52.000 --> 03:50:55.840]  i mean you can put your you can you dig a hole and stick your head in the sand if you want to
[03:50:55.840 --> 03:51:00.640]  do and this doesn't just go to the info war's audience this goes to every free person out
[03:51:00.640 --> 03:51:07.600]  there all around the world who believes in freedom who believes in god who believes in goodness
[03:51:08.240 --> 03:51:16.960]  who believes in in humanity um this is where we are now this this this is no longer uh some sci-fi
[03:51:16.960 --> 03:51:24.000]  fictional uh future this is this is this is what we're gearing up for and and the war in
[03:51:24.000 --> 03:51:30.640]  ukraine is central because you got two outcomes you got a vladimir pudin who submits to potentially
[03:51:30.640 --> 03:51:37.360]  maybe they kill him maybe they bring new russia new russian uh uh you know leader in maybe you
[03:51:37.360 --> 03:51:42.400]  know maybe there's one already waiting in the waiting in the shadows to take over uh and and
[03:51:42.400 --> 03:51:48.640]  then you'll have one more country that that can't stand against this global inertia even if i don't
[03:51:48.640 --> 03:51:54.560]  necessarily agree with vladimir pudin or or like him personally that doesn't matter that that's in
[03:51:54.560 --> 03:52:00.960]  material uh the the point is is that he is one person out there who has a very very powerful
[03:52:00.960 --> 03:52:08.160]  country a very rich country uh in natural resources and won't bend the knee so easily and if he if he
[03:52:08.160 --> 03:52:14.640]  if he has there's there's another alternative here there's a few but there's another alternative
[03:52:14.640 --> 03:52:21.680]  in in this line of thought maybe he's in on it now maybe he's in on it now and he in the world
[03:52:21.680 --> 03:52:26.640]  economic forum or the united nations are working in conjunction or collaboration to put on this
[03:52:26.640 --> 03:52:32.480]  entire front uh to to keep people distracted from some other play we don't know we don't know
[03:52:32.480 --> 03:52:37.920]  all we all we can all we can look at our is the results and the results as money is getting printed
[03:52:37.920 --> 03:52:43.760]  up and spent on the backs of human beings slavery you want to talk about slavery you know we we can
[03:52:43.760 --> 03:52:48.240]  talk about american slavery the slavery black people we can talk about the cobalt minds they're
[03:52:48.240 --> 03:52:58.480]  in the congo we're all your environmentalists uh uh uh woke neoliberal scam artists uh are saying
[03:52:58.480 --> 03:53:04.240]  that that we need to go to electric vehicles we have to go electric we have to go environmental
[03:53:04.240 --> 03:53:09.520]  friendly sustainability and they know good well that most of the lithium batteries most of the
[03:53:09.520 --> 03:53:14.320]  cobalt that you need for lithium batteries is pulled right out of a slave mine right there in
[03:53:14.320 --> 03:53:19.680]  the right there in the congo and and they know how they took hold of the congo they did it by fiat
[03:53:19.680 --> 03:53:24.720]  currency they're printing fake money and they're handed it to conglies i think that's what they're
[03:53:24.720 --> 03:53:30.320]  called conglies they're they're handed to conglies warlords or dictators and saying we'll give you
[03:53:30.320 --> 03:53:36.080]  a little if you give us a lot and the a lot you can give us are the backs of those those 15 000
[03:53:36.080 --> 03:53:41.360]  people that will stuff down there in the the cobalt mind to pick the cobalt with their hands
[03:53:42.160 --> 03:53:52.080]  those videos those videos are um are are dark you know and it's there's and there's another
[03:53:52.080 --> 03:53:59.600]  alternative and and this is probably the worst case scenario with the war but let's say it goes
[03:53:59.600 --> 03:54:06.880]  nuclear in which case potentially both parties could still be in on it i mean we just don't
[03:54:06.880 --> 03:54:13.840]  know at this point we just don't know we don't know how deep the deception runs uh and that seems
[03:54:13.840 --> 03:54:21.600]  like uh like uh a dooms a doom and gloom prognosis but it's really not you know we need to pray we
[03:54:21.600 --> 03:54:26.480]  need to have faith we need to be able to answer the call but but let's say we do go to nuclear war
[03:54:26.480 --> 03:54:32.960]  let's say we do have a nuclear exchange it'll just be a pretext to to have all of the things
[03:54:32.960 --> 03:54:39.360]  that they want coming to fruition which partly makes me believe that Putin's not in on it
[03:54:40.720 --> 03:54:44.800]  the way i see this war let's hope he's not in on it if he's in on it that would be
[03:54:44.800 --> 03:54:52.480]  truly catastrophic in a literal sense but let's say he's not in on it what they're trying to do
[03:54:52.480 --> 03:54:58.320]  is provoke a war a nuclear war there is not a better there is not a better
[03:54:59.680 --> 03:55:07.600]  flashpoint for this establishment than to incite a nuclear war the nuclear war brings them
[03:55:07.600 --> 03:55:15.760]  everything they need they have the crisis they need for both the environment and public safety
[03:55:15.760 --> 03:55:23.680]  all the the the big two for you have a climate crisis and public safety crisis at the same time
[03:55:24.320 --> 03:55:28.960]  and and it'll give them it'll give them the authority the emergency authority that we
[03:55:28.960 --> 03:55:36.240]  already saw them misuse with covid the emergency authority to usher in a new currency to restructure
[03:55:36.240 --> 03:55:42.720]  and redraw the borders of all of the nations which they'll blow out completely there'll be no more
[03:55:42.720 --> 03:55:48.720]  borders that'll be that'll be how the the whole thing ends up and whatever else they want to do
[03:55:49.520 --> 03:55:54.560]  and they'll literally they'll suspend the constitution i mean we we love our constitution at
[03:55:54.560 --> 03:56:01.120]  least the people who love the constitution love the constitution but but we we sort of you know
[03:56:01.120 --> 03:56:08.240]  have this a grand eyes view of our constitution like the constitution in some ways cannot be usurped
[03:56:08.240 --> 03:56:13.360]  uh i mean you know there are people who you separate all the time are trying to but we still
[03:56:13.360 --> 03:56:19.120]  have this sort of childlike love of the constitution when in reality when things get to the point
[03:56:19.120 --> 03:56:23.760]  where where we have nuclear exchanges they'll suspend the constitution and the people who
[03:56:23.760 --> 03:56:30.880]  say they love it will beg they'll beg for tyranny that's what we have to be prepared for now we
[03:56:30.880 --> 03:56:37.360]  have to we have to sharpen our minds and sharpen our spirits and sharpen our you know sharpen our
[03:56:37.360 --> 03:56:44.720]  tools our literal tools to prepare for that moment because when that moment comes it'll blow your mind
[03:56:44.720 --> 03:56:50.560]  how fast people will beg for tyranny uh in the name of safety in the name of food in the name of
[03:56:50.560 --> 03:57:00.000]  security and the the name of surety um we have to watch this war i'm very very concerned when i see
[03:57:00.000 --> 03:57:07.360]  that we're bombing 300 400 miles in russia i thought we were keeping russia from invading ukraine
[03:57:07.360 --> 03:57:14.480]  now we're invading russia and every couple hundred years some jerk off gets gets brave enough to try
[03:57:14.480 --> 03:57:20.960]  and invade russia conquer russia defeat russia subdue russia it'll never happen you cannot defeat
[03:57:20.960 --> 03:57:26.560]  russia you cannot conquer russia all you can do is a mutual destruction and in some cases and in
[03:57:26.560 --> 03:57:32.720]  some estimations and some people's prognosis that's exactly what this global government wants it's
[03:57:32.720 --> 03:57:42.560]  what they need to go to the next phase of their agenda thank you godspeed

[03:58:45.360 --> 03:58:53.120]  info wars md in arizona i think we watched the election be uh stolen slowly stolen day by day
[03:58:53.120 --> 03:59:00.400]  counting these mail-in ballots and it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously
[03:59:00.400 --> 03:59:07.280]  when we we just it's election month alex it's not election day and that's the problem and
[03:59:07.280 --> 03:59:12.320]  everything changed after covet nineteen they illegally changed state elections
[03:59:12.320 --> 03:59:18.000]  uh mailing ballots to anyone and everyone and sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people
[03:59:18.000 --> 03:59:22.720]  well this isn't any way to run an election we're in a serious country when we have elections that
[03:59:22.720 --> 03:59:28.320]  can be stolen like this and i believe that just like i believe the election was stolen in 2020
[03:59:28.320 --> 03:59:34.080]  and i have no problem saying that and it's it is so absurd for the media and the democrats to attack
[03:59:34.080 --> 03:59:40.400]  us that that question our election integrity and question the the fact that elections um
[03:59:40.400 --> 03:59:45.760]  shouldn't be run the way they are we're not election deniers we're election realists
[03:59:45.760 --> 04:00:08.400]  uh leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
