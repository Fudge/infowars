[01:12.520 --> 01:16.000]  update on Bilderberg 2009 because a lot of stuff comes out a few days after
[01:16.000 --> 01:22.120]  Bilderberg ends and then we have this Dr. Jonathan Levy on I saw him on a new
[01:22.120 --> 01:27.760]  a new show talking about the Illuminati tied into the Vatican Bank and a bunch of
[01:27.760 --> 01:32.240]  news and information along those lines so I thought I'd get him on to get his
[01:32.240 --> 01:38.120]  take on it that is coming up in the fourth hour today so should be quite
[01:38.120 --> 01:44.880]  informative as well and we will have open phones for all of these guests today
[01:44.880 --> 01:52.400]  World Health Organization chief says world should prepare for severe flu
[01:52.400 --> 01:56.520]  that's right and they're saying that they need to have a big police state
[01:56.520 --> 02:01.680]  system in place by this fall when it's sure to to devastate us give up all our
[02:01.680 --> 02:06.280]  rights to a world government in the name of medical safety and stopping
[02:06.280 --> 02:12.640]  pandemics so we'll go over that report also the odds on the dollar treasury
[02:12.640 --> 02:17.200]  bonds and the u.s. government triple a grade rating all heading for the
[02:17.200 --> 02:22.440]  dubster are shortening and we have Bloomberg today Geithner vows to cut
[02:22.440 --> 02:28.000]  u.s. deficit on rating concern and Geithner is now terrorizing the United
[02:28.000 --> 02:32.520]  States being an offshore banker that he is the corporate looter saying we may
[02:32.520 --> 02:35.800]  lose our triple a rating that will of course destroy confidence and probably
[02:35.800 --> 02:40.120]  do that which is what these guys want they like blowing out markets and
[02:40.120 --> 02:44.800]  consolidating it's in their own statements again a market watch Wall
[02:44.800 --> 02:52.000]  Street Journal reporting that gold futures rose today for the four straight
[02:52.000 --> 02:57.320]  session briefly topping $690 an ounce gold is right up at almost $600 and
[02:57.320 --> 03:02.800]  $960 an ounce $960 an ounce right now for the first time nearly two months as
[03:02.800 --> 03:06.960]  the U.S. dollar weakened against its major rivals on concerns of the U.S.
[03:06.960 --> 03:12.400]  credit rating that is coming up obviously Bob Chapman on the next hour
[03:12.400 --> 03:16.560]  also New York terror plot another government provocateur set up you know
[03:16.560 --> 03:21.480]  I mentioned this yesterday when it was big national news but I didn't really
[03:21.480 --> 03:27.040]  cover it properly so we'll go over that coming up in the next segment very very
[03:27.040 --> 03:31.920]  important because it it fits the shake and make things the FBI does a couple
[03:31.920 --> 03:37.440]  times a year it's always the same MO always the same story except for sometimes
[03:37.440 --> 03:41.400]  the feds actually give them the weapons and and the bombs and have them carry
[03:41.400 --> 03:45.720]  out the attacks or they hire idiots and tell them oh you're gonna take part in
[03:45.720 --> 03:49.720]  drills you're now a secret agent and then they burn them and the people go to
[03:49.720 --> 03:53.040]  court and even have proof sometimes they record the feds telling them you're a
[03:53.040 --> 03:57.880]  secret agent for America we need you to drive this truck in here and park it they
[03:57.880 --> 04:02.840]  grab them and say we got hard core al-Qaeda we need to take the American
[04:02.840 --> 04:06.400]  people's guns and Homeland Security needs to crack down on veterans and
[04:06.400 --> 04:10.960]  conservatives see see they sell conservatives the American people on
[04:10.960 --> 04:15.240]  we're taking your rights and setting up this police state for the evil Muslims
[04:15.240 --> 04:20.440]  and evil terrorists and evil Middle Easterners and then the minute they set
[04:20.440 --> 04:23.960]  it up it's being used against the American people it was designed to be
[04:23.960 --> 04:27.840]  used against us recession turns malls into ghost towns will be going over
[04:27.840 --> 04:35.440]  that members of parliaments in England members of parliament England express the
[04:35.440 --> 04:40.880]  fact that they're so depressed they may commit suicide over the expenses scandal
[04:40.880 --> 04:44.440]  this is a big distraction you know they'll talk about members of
[04:44.440 --> 04:48.360]  parliament engaged in petty corruption which is bad enough instead of the
[04:48.360 --> 04:52.200]  massive corruption being run by the illegitimate national security state
[04:52.200 --> 04:56.480]  government so we'll break that down as well and the New York Times attacked me
[04:56.480 --> 05:02.080]  savagely yesterday we'll get into that hello friends this is Alex Jones I've

[08:00.520 --> 08:06.760]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information
[08:06.760 --> 08:13.440]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[08:13.440 --> 08:35.320]  the mainstream media continues to overlay lies on top of the truth and to
[08:35.320 --> 08:42.240]  spin as well to take stories and focus in on minutiae or disinformation that
[08:42.240 --> 08:47.640]  they planted in them you will see literally hundreds of articles every day
[08:47.640 --> 08:53.600]  and news reports one can see where they tell you the economy is getting better
[08:53.600 --> 08:57.520]  everything is great just do what the central bankers tell you and everything
[08:57.520 --> 09:02.440]  is going to be okay and we're going to be out of this recession in just six
[09:02.440 --> 09:07.040]  months to a year now remember we were telling you three plus years ago we were
[09:07.040 --> 09:11.880]  in a serious recession and then what eight nine months ago they had to come
[09:11.880 --> 09:18.040]  out and admit okay we've been in a recession for over a year but that
[09:18.040 --> 09:22.880]  itself is a lie because if you look at it since the mid 1960s there has been a
[09:22.880 --> 09:28.000]  loss of standard of living across the board and we become a complete debtor
[09:28.000 --> 09:34.600]  nation since the 1960s when we were the most wealthy nation per capita on the
[09:34.600 --> 09:38.640]  planet we are now one of the most indebted nations on the planet corporate
[09:38.640 --> 09:46.960]  private government you see the private central bankers don't want to fix the
[09:46.960 --> 09:50.760]  economy they don't want you to do well they think we have to highest standard
[09:50.760 --> 09:55.680]  of living they want to bankrupt everybody and make us all poor and dependent
[09:55.680 --> 10:00.640]  on the state so they can engineer society to a greater extent by making us
[10:00.640 --> 10:05.880]  dependent on the system and this is all stated over and over again by the
[10:05.880 --> 10:10.200]  establishment in their actual white papers that we quote at nauseam but the
[10:10.200 --> 10:15.800]  white papers aren't what gets quoted in the news the news reports and parrots
[10:15.800 --> 10:20.280]  the false reality and the spin the lies the disinformation with a sprinkling of
[10:20.280 --> 10:25.840]  truth all the establishment arrogantly
[10:28.160 --> 10:32.320]  converses with themselves at the international level bragging about the
[10:32.320 --> 10:37.240]  great job they're doing conquering the planet through economic degradation and
[10:37.240 --> 10:43.920]  physical warfare and I'm again in the financial news coming up we got a big
[10:43.920 --> 10:50.080]  show today lined up but I watched Obama's speech yesterday I watched his part
[10:50.080 --> 10:57.080]  of a speech at anapolis at the Naval Academy this morning and all he is is a
[10:57.080 --> 11:02.640]  handsome guy who can speak well and has a nice cadence to his voice reading off
[11:02.640 --> 11:06.320]  of a teleprompter but the teleprompter did mess up a few times you can see him
[11:06.320 --> 11:10.200]  getting very angry and having to wait for it to load he'll even sometimes say
[11:10.200 --> 11:14.480]  okay waiting for the teleprompter to load and if this is what the American
[11:14.480 --> 11:17.680]  people want to sell out to and the American people want to be bamboozled
[11:17.680 --> 11:25.520]  and conned and taken for a ride by a the first Arab American president that is
[11:25.520 --> 11:33.240]  their problem I mean he is 50% Anglo-Saxon and then he's less than 10%
[11:33.240 --> 11:42.400]  African and the rest of the 50% is Arab so I guess you could say he's America's
[11:42.400 --> 11:46.480]  first Arab American president and that's fine by me so I mean they could sit
[11:46.480 --> 11:50.120]  there and watch the first Arab American president and I guess people think it's
[11:50.120 --> 11:53.560]  different because they told him he's black I mean everything is a hoax I don't
[11:53.560 --> 11:57.800]  care if he's white or black or Arab or Chinese I'd love to have a Chinese
[11:57.800 --> 12:03.320]  president you know it could be a Venezuelan you know as long as they were
[12:03.320 --> 12:09.320]  a US citizen and born here I don't care we could have a Chilean president we
[12:09.320 --> 12:13.240]  could have a South African president you know whose mommy or daddy were from
[12:13.240 --> 12:16.160]  South Africa I don't care as long as they leave my second amendment alone and
[12:16.160 --> 12:21.240]  don't take all my money and pay it to foreign bankers but they make it all
[12:21.240 --> 12:31.080]  about how he's black well I mean if people think it's a fun ride to be taken
[12:31.080 --> 12:36.480]  on to just sit there and watch a guy with darker skin read off a teleprompter
[12:36.480 --> 12:43.840]  and lie to him it's really just pathetic but I was watching him and you know he
[12:43.840 --> 12:51.120]  talks about our values so he says that not following our values of the Bill
[12:51.120 --> 12:56.280]  writes a constitution but he dare not name them in boldens our enemies and
[12:56.280 --> 13:04.720]  energizes them and makes us look bad worldwide which is true but he basically
[13:04.720 --> 13:09.280]  said you know we're not doing this for good II two shoes human rights this just
[13:09.280 --> 13:17.760]  makes us look bad and so we're not going to do it and so the speech writers for
[13:17.760 --> 13:21.640]  Obama everything they do is very seductive it's all multi-layered it's
[13:21.640 --> 13:28.440]  it's meant for all the major audiences and niches that are out there he's got
[13:28.440 --> 13:33.200]  one for the Warhawks who can't find Central Asia on a map but like to talk
[13:33.200 --> 13:37.480]  about last parking lots and nuking people he talks about getting tough on
[13:37.480 --> 13:42.120]  enemies and will defend America and will strike somebody make no mistake and
[13:42.120 --> 13:45.960]  we're gonna keep America safe I'm keeping my promise that's why I'm not
[13:45.960 --> 13:50.480]  going to release these people and I'm gonna have indefinite attention then he
[13:50.480 --> 13:54.080]  goes on to criticize Cheney and he says but I'm not gonna destroy America's
[13:54.080 --> 14:05.880]  values and we are gonna make sure that we change the way prisoners are held and
[14:05.880 --> 14:13.080]  then he goes on to placate to Europe and placate to other nations and so what
[14:13.080 --> 14:21.080]  this is is this is a temp it's it's soft power now if you strip away all of the
[14:21.080 --> 14:25.320]  smoke screen all of the double and triple and quadruple talk it's literally
[14:25.320 --> 14:29.000]  quadruple talk I mean I was sitting there running on the treadmill watching
[14:29.000 --> 14:32.080]  this and just thinking wishing I had a notepad because it would be pages of
[14:32.080 --> 14:38.320]  notes of just all the subtle spin and lies and twisting and so they lay one
[14:38.320 --> 14:41.680]  lie on top of another on top of another on top of another on top of another with
[14:41.680 --> 14:46.320]  some spin and with some truth and then with some more spin and some more lies
[14:46.320 --> 14:52.560]  and then with some innuendo and then most importantly the key ingredient to
[14:52.560 --> 15:00.000]  this which is brew of deception this this sorcery of lies is the fighting with
[15:00.000 --> 15:07.840]  Cheney the partisanship that's then what sells the Democrats and people who
[15:07.840 --> 15:11.640]  aren't just Democrats but that are repulsed by what Bush and his cronies
[15:11.640 --> 15:20.200]  did though they were just puppets of the New World Order the final ingredient the
[15:20.200 --> 15:28.480]  toe of newt that they add into the witches brew is the partisanship because
[15:28.480 --> 15:32.640]  then though people know they're getting triple talking double talking quadruple
[15:32.640 --> 15:35.600]  talking they're getting lied to and people are catching it they're saying
[15:35.600 --> 15:39.320]  wait a minute indefinite detention that's what Cheney wanted but doesn't
[15:39.320 --> 15:44.600]  matter Cheney's attacking Obama with a 9% approval rating totally unpopular
[15:44.600 --> 15:49.840]  most unpopular person in modern politics in the history of polling and so
[15:49.840 --> 15:53.400]  automatically well I guess if Cheney saying Obama's bad and leaving us wide
[15:53.400 --> 15:57.200]  open to terrorist and wanting to put terrorists on the streets of America
[15:57.200 --> 16:03.680]  which is a total lie then Obama must be good and then everything the globalist
[16:03.680 --> 16:08.600]  push for under Bush gets cemented into place secret arrest secret attention
[16:08.600 --> 16:12.960]  secret tribunal secret military commissions for citizens as well I
[16:12.960 --> 16:16.560]  told you because I read the executive order and statements months ago it's
[16:16.560 --> 16:20.720]  all an in game excuse me it's all in the Obama deception that they're gonna keep
[16:20.720 --> 16:24.800]  them at federal super max prisons where US citizens are held without their
[16:24.800 --> 16:30.480]  rights and I was watching Fox News this morning and they had the I forget his
[16:30.480 --> 16:34.320]  name black reporter from the White House saying exactly what I said they do
[16:34.320 --> 16:38.560]  but saying it was good he was saying it was good that they're gonna hold them
[16:38.560 --> 16:43.560]  at these super maxes with no rights and the reporter went on to admit that
[16:43.560 --> 16:47.280]  Zacharias Michelle he's there who wasn't the 20th hijacker and that that's been
[16:47.280 --> 16:52.000]  discredited and fake but it doesn't matter that's still good and then the
[16:52.000 --> 16:57.600]  anchor the dark-haired white anchor sure you Fox News listeners know their
[16:57.600 --> 17:02.520]  names I don't he's up there and he says but wait Obama wants to release
[17:02.520 --> 17:06.440]  terrorist on the streets of America no one has ever said they're being released
[17:06.440 --> 17:10.360]  on the streets of America and no one has confirmed their terrorist remember
[17:10.360 --> 17:14.880]  they've been tortured for five six seven years that's admitted on over two
[17:14.880 --> 17:18.480]  thirds of the intelligence briefings you know you'd hear Alcada was planning to
[17:18.480 --> 17:22.320]  blow up the Sears Tower Alcada was planning to blow this up Alcada was
[17:22.320 --> 17:25.200]  planning to blow that up we had absolute proof they were gonna nuke
[17:25.200 --> 17:30.280]  Chicago they were gonna nuke DC they don't have nukes folks Alcada doesn't
[17:30.280 --> 17:34.480]  exist outside the CIA and MI6 and Mossad that's just a historical fact who
[17:34.480 --> 17:40.920]  created Alcada to attack the Russians those three groups I just listed just a
[17:40.920 --> 17:47.680]  historical fact here you don't like it I'm sorry and so the big price here is
[17:47.680 --> 17:53.640]  to set the precedent to have secret arrest indefinite detention and the
[17:53.640 --> 17:56.680]  argument of well we can't release these people because we don't have proof this
[17:56.680 --> 18:03.280]  is word-for-word on MSNBC CNN and Fox I was surfing back and forth it was the
[18:03.280 --> 18:07.520]  same thing parroted over and over again well we gotta go ahead and keep America
[18:07.520 --> 18:10.680]  safe by indefinitely holding people without trial though we don't have proof
[18:10.680 --> 18:16.400]  and that's getting America's good name back that's the Bill of Rights and
[18:16.400 --> 18:19.840]  Constitution and you read the Military Commissions Act we've had top former
[18:19.840 --> 18:25.640]  Jag generals on we've had top law school top constitutional law scholars but I
[18:25.640 --> 18:28.720]  can read the Military Commissions Act and tell you I don't need them to tell
[18:28.720 --> 18:32.560]  you I mean I wrote the articles first just pointing it out people couldn't
[18:32.560 --> 18:35.720]  believe it then they looked at it but that Military Commissions Act the
[18:35.720 --> 18:40.840]  Military Tribunals says the President the Justice Department the Pentagon or
[18:40.840 --> 18:44.720]  any other designates just say they think you might be a terrorist your
[18:44.720 --> 18:49.600]  citizenship is stolen secretly withdrawn you're snatched off the road or
[18:49.600 --> 18:53.080]  snatched out of your house literally with a bag over your head you're flown
[18:53.080 --> 18:58.560]  out on CIA aircraft when they're not crashing full of cocaine in Mexico or
[18:58.560 --> 19:02.160]  in South Texas or in Arkansas or in Florida you know planes of crash
[19:02.160 --> 19:06.120]  everywhere full of cocaine cops pull up men in black shop machine guns they
[19:06.120 --> 19:09.040]  offload the cocaine the police bow down that's the end of it they're throwing a
[19:09.040 --> 19:16.080]  few bags for themselves so that's how America operates and so they've just set
[19:16.080 --> 19:20.920]  the precedent they're just like yeah Obama he fixed it he's just gonna set
[19:20.920 --> 19:25.000]  in stone the end of the Bill of Rights in the Constitution as the Democrats
[19:25.000 --> 19:28.560]  introduced legislation to ban US citizens owning guns if they're on secret
[19:28.560 --> 19:33.680]  terrorist no more Bill of Rights no more Constitution just guilty period just
[19:33.680 --> 19:37.400]  as they say so introducing bills to openly ban all free speech in America
[19:37.400 --> 19:41.840]  the cyberbullying act just says will it arrest anybody we want no more free
[19:41.840 --> 19:45.920]  speech they're saying we're gonna go past free speech zones just no protest
[19:45.920 --> 19:52.320]  in period just absolute tyranny because America had to get rid of all its
[19:52.320 --> 19:56.760]  freedoms because there was a bunch of 14 and 15 year olds at Guantanamo Bay we
[19:56.760 --> 20:00.520]  just had to give up all our rights or they'd get us
[20:05.000 --> 20:09.600]  have you ever noticed that celebrities are endorsing weight-loss products and

[24:57.000 --> 25:03.880]  Josh Donovan and many others that are patiently holding so this is a new level
[25:03.880 --> 25:07.440]  of scientific disinformation that completely confuses the public but you
[25:07.440 --> 25:11.600]  know I gave the parallel yesterday you want to understand it make it simple for
[25:11.600 --> 25:20.000]  others Obama and his handlers Geithner and others who are in seamless unison
[25:20.000 --> 25:24.200]  with the Bush cronies and their handlers it's all the New York Fed running the
[25:24.200 --> 25:28.120]  country the private offshore fellow reserve known as the New York Fed and
[25:28.120 --> 25:32.280]  they just wrap themselves the American flag but their offshore parasites they
[25:32.280 --> 25:35.840]  engineered the banker takeover they engineered the economic implosion to
[25:35.840 --> 25:40.080]  consolidate wealth they engineered the giant bonuses for the CEOs and the
[25:40.080 --> 25:45.640]  corporate minions and then Obama continued all of that and expanded it and
[25:45.640 --> 25:50.160]  then comes out and speaks out against it and says he's gonna fight it and it's
[25:50.160 --> 25:54.160]  the same thing oh he's gonna end the Iraq war day one he's gonna end it
[25:54.160 --> 25:58.680]  immediately we have those video clips the Obama deception then eight months
[25:58.680 --> 26:02.240]  into the election you know eight months before the election he changed it says
[26:02.240 --> 26:07.760]  oh I'll do it in 16 months then 21 then there's a revolt by the generals and all
[26:07.760 --> 26:13.600]  they say maybe forever and then now it's just kind of a dead issue and then
[26:13.600 --> 26:17.440]  whenever a brigade comes home they just rotate it the news doesn't say they're
[26:17.440 --> 26:21.440]  rotating a brigade they say look troops are coming home troops are coming home
[26:21.440 --> 26:25.800]  yeah being replaced by others so they're overall increasing the amount of
[26:25.800 --> 26:31.760]  troops in Iraq in Afghanistan in Middle East into Central Asia and they're
[26:31.760 --> 26:37.240]  moving more troops into Georgia and doing drills and encircling Russia last
[26:37.240 --> 26:43.240]  time Bush did a drill on 888 the week before 888 NATO soldiers led a sneak
[26:43.240 --> 26:48.920]  attack against South Ossetia and then our media is so evil and so corrupt that
[26:48.920 --> 26:52.400]  they came out and said Russia has launched a sneak attack and it even
[26:52.400 --> 26:57.120]  fooled me for about an hour I turned singing in on and they said Russia has
[26:57.120 --> 27:05.480]  been has launched a sneak attack and you know deep down I'm America you'll fight
[27:05.480 --> 27:09.720]  the commies you know even though they're not the commies and I you know go on
[27:09.720 --> 27:13.240]  air and start saying I don't know you know by the time I got on air I was
[27:13.240 --> 27:17.680]  saying I don't know all these foreign reports say that NATO launched a sneak
[27:17.680 --> 27:23.200]  attack but the news is saying Russia launched it you know we'll see and then
[27:23.200 --> 27:27.680]  it came out within hours it was a complete total fabrication that inside
[27:27.680 --> 27:37.160]  the UN bases US Ukrainian Georgian NATO forces would walk up and shoot the
[27:37.160 --> 27:42.400]  Russians in the back I mean they were killing them in the barracks this was a
[27:42.400 --> 27:49.240]  black op attack the most dastardly sneak attack you can launch inside the bases
[27:49.240 --> 27:54.640]  they were killing people in the machine gun nest right next to their fellow
[27:54.640 --> 28:01.920]  soldiers for the first minutes of the attack they were stabbing them they were
[28:01.920 --> 28:05.800]  slitting their throats they were grabbing them around the mouth and stabbing
[28:05.800 --> 28:12.280]  them in the kidney or slitting their throats so that they could then get past
[28:12.280 --> 28:16.840]  the centuries centuries into the barracks and machine gun everyone in
[28:16.840 --> 28:20.520]  their beds I mean that's the level of sneak attack ladies and gentlemen
[28:20.520 --> 28:24.800]  that's what our media and government is it launches sneak attacks on a
[28:24.800 --> 28:33.960]  government that has 10,000 nuclear weapons in South Ossetia or NATO in the
[28:33.960 --> 28:41.400]  early 90s launched attacks to break off that area and taken into Georgia it's
[28:41.400 --> 28:46.040]  always been part of Russia and George's been part of Russia for hundreds and
[28:46.040 --> 28:49.560]  hundreds of years and they have all their rights to break away if they want
[28:49.560 --> 28:57.600]  but not because George Soros and the big central banks want to run heroin
[28:57.600 --> 29:03.480]  through there and launder money and run white slavery rings through there
[29:03.480 --> 29:08.040]  I forgot Israel was there admittedly that was in herettes and Jerusalem post
[29:08.040 --> 29:12.720]  running sneak attacks as well I mean this is lunacy ladies and gentlemen this
[29:12.720 --> 29:19.440]  is madness they want a new Cold War to sell weapons systems and they need a new
[29:19.440 --> 29:22.640]  Cold War so they can say we're taking your rights and freedom in America
[29:22.640 --> 29:26.400]  because of the Ruskies we're taking your rights and freedom in America because of

[35:02.800 --> 35:17.520]  moment let me hit some of the financial news here there are a whole bunch of
[35:17.520 --> 35:22.240]  mainstream news articles in the Associated Press Reuters you name it
[35:22.240 --> 35:29.120]  today saying we've been reporting for years that China India Latin America
[35:29.120 --> 35:34.160]  Russia the Middle East they're all moving including Europe away from the
[35:34.160 --> 35:37.880]  dollar and into the euro and into their own currencies and now they're talking
[35:37.880 --> 35:48.840]  about the Chinese Yon the Chinese currency the Japanese currency Yon's
[35:48.840 --> 35:53.120]  Yen's all those different currencies over there creating a basket that is the
[35:53.120 --> 35:57.560]  New World Reserve currency that they've already created a basket of world
[35:57.560 --> 36:01.440]  currencies but more and more of the dollar is being removed out of that
[36:01.440 --> 36:08.000]  equation and the basket is going to be made up of the Chinese currency and the
[36:08.000 --> 36:13.640]  European Union currency the Europe and the dollar is going to be a toilet paper
[36:13.640 --> 36:24.440]  currency like the peso in Mexico or the Venezuelan peso or the Chilean peso or
[36:24.440 --> 36:37.240]  the Argentinian peso and so that's how it works ladies and gentlemen and we're
[36:37.240 --> 36:40.320]  just seeing more and more signs confirming this is going to happen and
[36:40.320 --> 36:44.800]  the mainstream media is saying it's probably going to happen and so when
[36:44.800 --> 36:49.520]  they start pushing it it means that it's getting close when they start admitting
[36:49.520 --> 36:55.080]  it and it's not interbank documents were reporting on or former Treasury heads
[36:55.080 --> 36:58.960]  were interviewing or New York Business School heads I mean you know there are
[36:58.960 --> 37:01.760]  a lot of financial experts saying this for years but when you start seeing it
[37:01.760 --> 37:07.800]  in Reuters AP Bloomberg you name it we got a big problem
[37:07.800 --> 37:14.800]  Bloomberg writer Mark Gilbert addresses all three facts today the World
[37:14.800 --> 37:18.280]  Reserve currency loss the bubble and Treasury bonds may be ending in the US
[37:18.280 --> 37:22.240]  may very well lose its triple a sovereign credit status the odds of the
[37:22.240 --> 37:26.760]  dollar Treasury bonds in the US government's triple a grade all heading
[37:26.760 --> 37:33.200]  for the dumpster are shortening well currency forecasting is a mugs game and
[37:33.200 --> 37:38.680]  bond yields can't quite decide whether to divide towards deflation or surge in
[37:38.680 --> 37:43.080]  anticipation of inflation every time I think about the credit rating I hear
[37:43.080 --> 37:49.080]  what agent Smith in the Matrix movies called this sound of inevitability that's
[37:49.080 --> 37:54.160]  right it's either gonna be absolutely horrible Weimar Republic Zimbabwean
[37:54.160 --> 37:58.960]  inflation or it's gonna be bone crushing mega depression and they can't
[37:58.960 --> 38:04.360]  balance in between those I mean you see the real economy dying right now it's
[38:04.360 --> 38:10.680]  probably gonna end up being hyperstag inflation the unknown black hole you know
[38:10.680 --> 38:17.640]  the singularity never before seen hyperstag inflation we saw stag inflation
[38:17.640 --> 38:22.160]  suppose he didn't exist in the 70s that was a slight taste of what banker false
[38:22.160 --> 38:29.640]  reality matrix can do several policy missteps suggest that investors should
[38:29.640 --> 38:32.920]  stop trusting and lending to the US government these include the state's
[38:32.920 --> 38:36.400]  pressure on Bank of America Corps to buy Merrill Lynch Co and it just goes on to
[38:36.400 --> 38:40.480]  cover more of it later with Bob Chapman the point is this is all by design we
[38:40.480 --> 38:44.160]  have the IMF World Bank documents Bilderberg group infiltrations it's
[38:44.160 --> 38:47.600]  proven to be accurate with our three four-year out forecasting that what the
[38:47.600 --> 38:54.040]  intel we're getting is the real deal that's what verifies Intel it's totally
[38:54.040 --> 38:57.800]  confirmed they are gonna gut us and that's why they got Northcom standing by
[38:57.800 --> 39:01.640]  that's why they got FEMA camps built that's why the Obama sent in the
[39:01.640 --> 39:04.760]  precedent for indefinite attention that's why they're saying they're about to
[39:04.760 --> 39:08.840]  ban the Second Amendment and free speech open bills we're just blasting through
[39:08.840 --> 39:13.480]  Congress but most of the public still partying and drinking margaritas
[39:13.480 --> 39:19.400]  giggling snickering it's all funny they have no idea people are still I you know
[39:19.400 --> 39:22.960]  I watch them in restaurants from in restaurants was in a restaurant last
[39:22.960 --> 39:27.880]  night and they had little TV set with Obama and I was watching people watch
[39:27.880 --> 39:32.440]  Obama they were just smiling just oh just looking at him like oh he's their
[39:32.440 --> 39:36.320]  friend you can watch the body language feeling powerful through him just like
[39:36.320 --> 39:40.640]  neocon followers with Bush and because they like to feel like they're part of
[39:40.640 --> 39:45.280]  the power structure and and everything's gonna be all right and oh and they're
[39:45.280 --> 39:49.800]  they like the winner president they like the slick president they like the cool
[39:49.800 --> 39:57.960]  president they like the powerful president they like the fact they voted for
[39:57.960 --> 40:02.600]  the winner oh he'll fix it all if these silly people will just do just what he
[40:02.600 --> 40:09.000]  says and let the banks take over everything but Geithner vows to cut US
[40:09.000 --> 40:13.880]  deficit on rating concern yes but see everybody knows that's a lie they're
[40:13.880 --> 40:18.320]  just pacifying everybody that oh we're gonna fix it we're gonna cut the deficit
[40:18.320 --> 40:23.480]  we're gonna cut the government we're cutting the government now this is like
[40:23.480 --> 40:29.040]  a person who eats 14 steaks in front of you huge buckets of cream buckets of
[40:29.040 --> 40:33.920]  ice cream they weigh 950 pounds and they tell you they're on a diet as they sit
[40:33.920 --> 40:41.600]  there gobbling food as fast as they can while sitting on the toilet I mean
[40:41.600 --> 40:45.640]  that's what this you know the globalist are that they're using the money to build
[40:45.640 --> 40:48.960]  their power base build their world structure while they destroy the economy
[40:48.960 --> 40:55.640]  and implode it the real Main Street economy the industries the jobs they
[40:55.640 --> 41:02.000]  run up an endless debt impossible to pay back ever 14.8 trillion spent in the
[41:02.000 --> 41:05.720]  last seven months according to Bloomberg and AP for foreign bankers to buy up real
[41:05.720 --> 41:10.480]  assets leaving you the bill and you got to pay interest on the money you give
[41:10.480 --> 41:14.000]  them you're not just paying for this folks you're gonna pay interest to them
[41:14.000 --> 41:19.640]  you're gonna pay them to take your money and enslave you and that cop for $35,000
[41:19.640 --> 41:24.040]  a year especially as the economy gets worse he'll do whatever he's told by
[41:24.040 --> 41:28.880]  these bankers he doesn't even know what a banker is he doesn't know what the new
[41:28.880 --> 41:33.760]  world order is your yuppie neighbor they'll rat you out when it comes down
[41:33.760 --> 41:39.400]  to it for bonus creds on their national ID card multi-pass their travel pass I'm
[41:39.400 --> 41:45.360]  not just singling out the police this is an evil government now I was here in
[41:45.360 --> 41:51.000]  stuff from somebody my office who worked in the city of San Marcos and he was
[41:51.000 --> 41:56.760]  telling me about some of the police commanders and what they haven't and this
[41:56.760 --> 41:59.240]  is somebody who I've known for years doesn't make stuff up and it just lets
[41:59.240 --> 42:05.680]  me know I mean it's just this government is so evil ladies and gentlemen it is
[42:05.680 --> 42:15.640]  pure evil at the top and it's spreading like cancer through the body okay
[42:15.640 --> 42:31.560]  so listen to me carefully ladies and gentlemen listen to me carefully they're
[42:31.560 --> 42:34.480]  going for broke they're pulling out all the stops they're gonna give us no
[42:34.480 --> 42:38.480]  quarter and I just want that to get through and everybody says this is not a
[42:38.480 --> 42:43.240]  game they're going for a hot bloody takeover that's why they don't care what
[42:43.240 --> 42:47.400]  crimes they engage in what they do they've passed the word to all their
[42:47.400 --> 42:51.760]  allied crime syndicates throughout the structure that they are going completely
[42:51.760 --> 43:06.120]  and totally wild period period period period and the question is what do we do
[43:06.120 --> 43:10.440]  about it well we expose these criminals who they are we use like in a judo move
[43:10.440 --> 43:13.880]  they're attack on us with the banker takeover to point out they engineered it
[43:13.880 --> 43:17.200]  all that's the facts we show how their criminals we show how they claim they're
[43:17.200 --> 43:24.880]  above the law how the Fed can't be audited and we just point out to
[43:24.880 --> 43:28.200]  everybody that the very bankers that engineered this crisis are getting more
[43:28.200 --> 43:34.600]  power out of it and we push to restore the Republic and we got a good chance of
[43:34.600 --> 43:38.840]  doing it if we believe in it and if we take action and if we don't listen to
[43:38.840 --> 43:45.160]  the to the PR siren song propaganda of resistance is futile you have no hope
[43:45.160 --> 43:51.680]  stand down you know they're beautiful women who are almost anorexic you can
[43:51.680 --> 43:54.960]  walk up and tell them they're fat and they'll start crying and say I know they've
[43:54.960 --> 43:58.160]  been taught by Madison Avenue to feel inadequate and to feel like they got to
[43:58.160 --> 44:06.160]  buy all these products from the time they were you know two years old but it's
[44:06.160 --> 44:09.280]  the same thing when the new world order tells American people you can't fight
[44:09.280 --> 44:13.840]  us we're invincible there's no way to beat us they're a bunch of degenerate
[44:13.840 --> 44:18.120]  scum all we've got to do is stand up and point out who they are and take action
[44:18.120 --> 44:23.080]  against them it's just as ridiculous to a man who knows a woman's beautiful when
[44:23.080 --> 44:25.720]  she you know what I mean it seems like the more beautiful the woman is in my
[44:25.720 --> 44:30.240]  life and I've had a lot of beautiful girlfriends before my beautiful wife they
[44:30.240 --> 44:35.120]  all think they're ugly you know the most beautiful woman is a good-looking
[44:35.120 --> 44:40.360]  woman who knows she's good-looking that's the sexiest thing on the earth the
[44:40.360 --> 44:48.520]  confident woman there's nothing like it but most women have bought the Madison
[44:48.520 --> 44:55.160]  Avenue lie they are insecure about themselves and against the same mind
[44:55.160 --> 44:58.360]  trick you're looking at this woman you know she's totally gorgeous beautiful
[44:58.360 --> 45:03.520]  person great personality sparkling eyes and they think they're ugly it's the
[45:03.520 --> 45:07.600]  same thing we think we're weak we think we don't have power it's a lie it's
[45:07.600 --> 45:13.480]  ridiculous it's a fraud break the spell break the Madison Avenue programming
[45:13.480 --> 45:19.120]  break it now all right your calls are coming up but I wanted to bring Jim
[45:19.120 --> 45:24.720]  newcomer in here because gold is up to 960 today and the futures it's now above
[45:24.720 --> 45:32.640]  that this is the end of the Frank's this is the end of the sovereigns they are
[45:32.640 --> 45:37.080]  running out quickly and we've done these offers before nothing quite this good
[45:37.080 --> 45:42.080]  but stuff close and people it when it's gone it's gone Ted has instructed them
[45:42.080 --> 45:46.240]  he's in Europe trying to get more gold and silver at an insane price he's in
[45:46.240 --> 45:51.560]  Europe now Jim newcomer chief metals analyst strategist at minus resources
[45:51.560 --> 45:57.720]  is on the horn with us Ted Anderson is in Europe right now he's about to run
[45:57.720 --> 46:04.800]  out of the Lakotas the Franklin silver half dollars the European Franks and the
[46:04.800 --> 46:09.880]  British sovereigns that he bought at the 880 level that's the one that what the
[46:09.880 --> 46:12.720]  market was at when he got these coins and they were a good deal then when he was
[46:12.720 --> 46:21.480]  offering them when he bought him an 880 they're now at 960 80 dollars up silver
[46:21.480 --> 46:25.480]  up and this is the end of this deal we're gonna spend a few minutes on it
[46:25.480 --> 46:28.560]  and go to break and come back and take your calls Jim newcomer with the economy
[46:28.560 --> 46:32.920]  deteriorating the dollar plunging all this happening but the suckers are
[46:32.920 --> 46:36.640]  jumping back into the stock market that is helter skelter should folks get into
[46:36.640 --> 46:40.760]  metals now absolutely that people jumping into the stock market I think
[46:40.760 --> 46:43.880]  we're making a big mistake there's three questions I think you have to ask
[46:43.880 --> 46:48.960]  yourself first do you believe the value of the dollar is gonna go up the second
[46:48.960 --> 46:54.320]  one is with the expanding middle classes in China and Asia South America do you
[46:54.320 --> 46:58.720]  think the demand for commodities is going to go down that being things like
[46:58.720 --> 47:03.040]  gold oil so forth and so on and the last is is there going to be an extended
[47:03.040 --> 47:07.280]  period of peace in my opinion if you can answer no to any two of those questions
[47:07.280 --> 47:11.880]  you should have been in metals yesterday because those are three key things to
[47:11.880 --> 47:17.680]  take a look at Jim I bought gold when it was $300 an ounce I bought silver one
[47:17.680 --> 47:22.120]  was $5 an ounce absolutely but I bought gold when it was $500 an ounce and
[47:22.120 --> 47:26.440]  silver when it was $14 an ounce and I bought gold when it's $900 an ounce you
[47:26.440 --> 47:31.040]  know when I can because I want insurance policy I don't trust the banks I don't
[47:31.040 --> 47:35.680]  trust the New World Order and I mean gold and silver outperforming every other
[47:35.680 --> 47:41.240]  investment in the last few years and this is a guaranteed deal right here you
[47:41.240 --> 47:47.360]  can get it at an 880 level get silver at a $13 level that Ted bought it yeah
[47:47.360 --> 47:50.880]  excellent opportunity I talked to Ted this morning we're actually out of some
[47:50.880 --> 47:54.720]  of these metals but he said to continue this price if we can through the weekend
[47:54.720 --> 47:58.680]  because it is a holiday weekend but I think he has been able to source some
[47:58.680 --> 48:01.920]  more metals over there so when we get back obviously we're gonna have to
[48:01.920 --> 48:06.320]  adjust the prices the markets are really pretty much on a tear here this past week
[48:06.320 --> 48:10.480]  you had mentioned silver silver's up 31% from the beginning of the year so
[48:10.480 --> 48:14.760]  that's an just an outstanding opportunity and anybody out there if you
[48:14.760 --> 48:18.240]  have any questions at all certainly call the brokers here at Midas the number
[48:18.240 --> 48:24.880]  is 800-686-2237 they're here to answer your questions and 70% of the people
[48:24.880 --> 48:27.960]  that we deal with are people that have never dealt in metals before no very
[48:27.960 --> 48:32.040]  little about it so don't be afraid to call call and talk to the brokers they'll
[48:32.040 --> 48:38.600]  answer your questions and Jim again we've got the so so Ted is running out of
[48:38.600 --> 48:43.680]  the sovereigns and the Franks at the 80 level but he's gonna honor that and the
[48:43.680 --> 48:50.040]  Lakota's and the other silver half dollars folks you cannot beat that Ted
[48:50.040 --> 48:55.800]  bought in the market at 880 and had him competitively priced then it's now 960
[48:55.800 --> 49:00.160]  and climbing Jim studying this for years what is happening right now I mean
[49:00.160 --> 49:04.680]  an explosive increase in gold and silver prices well one of the biggest things
[49:04.680 --> 49:09.320]  is that the banks are buying it now the you had talked earlier about the central
[49:09.320 --> 49:13.080]  banks I think the central banks in Europe 60% of their assets are now tied up
[49:13.080 --> 49:17.280]  in gold or precious metals I think you're gonna find that more and more
[49:17.280 --> 49:20.640]  they're even shying away from the currencies because they realize the
[49:20.640 --> 49:25.680]  currencies are virtually worthless that's the biggest demand but when you
[49:25.680 --> 49:30.440]  have an emerging middle class in China I mean the huge population of China India
[49:30.440 --> 49:34.720]  and in Brazil as well in South American countries they have a middle class now
[49:34.720 --> 49:38.760]  that can afford these things and they also are out there looking to source to
[49:38.760 --> 49:42.680]  buy the precious metals because they understand the value of the precious
[49:42.680 --> 49:48.240]  metals well Jim newcomer at minus that's what's scary about this is that all over
[49:48.240 --> 49:53.120]  the world people are leaving all the major currencies they're just leaving the
[49:53.120 --> 49:59.520]  dollar the fastest and so they're realizing that this is a global inflationary
[49:59.520 --> 50:04.800]  situation and currencies but a depression in the real economy how do you see
[50:04.800 --> 50:08.600]  this playing out I mean this this is really looking bad well it appears that
[50:08.600 --> 50:13.520]  this country is going down the currency is going down but as you said it's been
[50:13.520 --> 50:17.520]  propped up because the countries in Europe and Asia have poured so much
[50:17.520 --> 50:21.520]  money into their economies a greater portion of their gross domestic product
[50:21.520 --> 50:25.320]  than we actually have here which drives their currencies a little bit lower it
[50:25.320 --> 50:31.200]  is effectively propped up the dollar but that's over I mean these people you know
[50:31.200 --> 50:34.160]  we can't we can only sell so many securities and we can't we don't have
[50:34.160 --> 50:37.760]  any buyers out there my god we're selling to ourselves now it's it's just a
[50:37.760 --> 50:43.800]  ridiculous situation that's right the Federal Reserve is buying its own
[50:43.800 --> 50:48.000]  garbage the U.S. government's doing that and it's all coming to a head ladies
[50:48.000 --> 50:52.600]  and gentlemen one of the deals of a lifetime on gold and silver right now
[50:52.600 --> 50:57.000]  only through Sunday evening the brokers will be there all weekend one eight

[51:02.280 --> 51:06.720]  does humidity mean to you most people think of hot and sticky summer days but
[51:06.720 --> 51:10.400]  many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of
[51:10.400 --> 51:15.200]  pure drinking water that's why I'd like you to visit a cola blue dot com a cola

[54:56.240 --> 54:59.760]  was selling this stuff that he bought at 880 you know at the price with a tiny
[54:59.760 --> 55:05.800]  markup now it's just such a great deal and with all this news out there I don't
[55:05.800 --> 55:13.000]  understand why more people don't rush into silver and gold well people are
[55:13.000 --> 55:16.640]  rushing into it I mean they're not out buying automobiles and they're not
[55:16.640 --> 55:20.480]  buying homes and they may not be buying clothing but they are shifting certainly
[55:20.480 --> 55:24.680]  their assets into the precious metals we see a big upsurge every day people
[55:24.680 --> 55:27.720]  trying to get out paper as fast as they can but I don't see why they're not
[55:27.720 --> 55:32.280]  rushing even faster well some people are so learned some of them are so worried

[56:44.920 --> 56:49.880]  slide show yesterday which was just a farce I didn't know Cheney was that
[56:49.880 --> 56:56.160]  ambulatory much less that vocal and it really if that really doesn't pay you
[56:56.160 --> 57:00.200]  know you talk about it being that being the key to it all I think it's gonna be
[57:00.200 --> 57:05.440]  there undoing I really think people are that are gonna look at Cheney and
[57:05.440 --> 57:10.040]  look and be like wait man we heard from you for eight years and here you are and
[57:10.040 --> 57:15.560]  we know why you're out here you know I and it and plus John Stewart he did a
[57:15.560 --> 57:18.680]  bit you should check out from yesterday that was really good about
[57:18.680 --> 57:23.440]  Cheney's meant to give Obama cover see he's unpopular so he comes out the
[57:23.440 --> 57:26.480]  tax Obama and it looks like Obama's following the Bill of Rights and
[57:26.480 --> 57:31.840]  Constitution when Obama's saying indefinite detention absolutely and if
[57:31.840 --> 57:36.200]  you watch the John Stewart video from yesterday he sat there doing his jump
[57:36.200 --> 57:40.680]  back and forth between but a Bush speech from 0 for and that speech from
[57:40.680 --> 57:45.280]  yesterday and Obama's just verbatim quote and Bush just one after another
[57:45.280 --> 57:48.640]  wait a minute John Stewart actually the right thing and show but a hypocrite
[57:48.640 --> 57:53.320]  Obama is absolutely he really did what's the name of that video we'll pull it

[1:00:30.520 --> 1:00:37.720]  you know it took several years for the depression to really get cranked most
[1:00:37.720 --> 1:00:42.640]  analysts including Nobel Prize winners for economics we've interviewed say this
[1:00:42.640 --> 1:00:48.360]  is gonna shape up to be worse than the Great Depression and it's gonna be worse
[1:00:48.360 --> 1:00:51.080]  because the globalists have greater control the whole planet it's gonna be
[1:00:51.080 --> 1:00:54.760]  planetary and they're using it to re-engineer society to bankrupt
[1:00:54.760 --> 1:00:59.480]  everyone so we're independent so that our independence is destroyed and handed
[1:00:59.480 --> 1:01:04.200]  over to them Bob Chapman coming up in the next segment let's go back to your

[1:01:09.160 --> 1:01:15.840]  ahead good good to hear from you I just wanted to tell you man I'm extremely
[1:01:15.840 --> 1:01:19.400]  proud of the work you did with that briefing getting the YouTube channel
[1:01:19.400 --> 1:01:23.480]  back up I thought that was excellent work that was a smack in the face of the
[1:01:23.480 --> 1:01:27.800]  man and I'm glad you were the man to deliver it for him well thank you I
[1:01:27.800 --> 1:01:30.920]  want to thank the listeners I mean I don't really get any other credit it
[1:01:30.920 --> 1:01:34.440]  was the great listeners calling and people taking action I mean I guess I did
[1:01:34.440 --> 1:01:39.400]  write up the federal filing brief myself but I just did it off other
[1:01:39.400 --> 1:01:43.640]  precedent setting cases I also wanted to tell you I saw that I have seen
[1:01:43.640 --> 1:01:47.680]  documentary on demand a little early a couple days ago I thought that they
[1:01:47.680 --> 1:01:52.880]  represented y'all pretty well I mean have you seen it yet yes it is it's
[1:01:52.880 --> 1:01:55.880]  called New World Order and you know what I will cover that later in the next hour
[1:01:55.880 --> 1:02:04.840]  I've got some time where I can cover it the filmmakers did kind of angle it to
[1:02:04.840 --> 1:02:09.640]  make us look extreme and cornball and paranoid but compared to other things I've
[1:02:09.640 --> 1:02:12.960]  seen it it's the fairest thing yet I mean you know kind of like you're a
[1:02:12.960 --> 1:02:16.520]  starving man and you could offer to rotten possum you could offer to rotten
[1:02:16.520 --> 1:02:23.000]  cow you could offer to rabbit with worms on it to eat and then you know a bowl of
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:27.320]  porridge with you know with only 14 or 15 maggots on the top that looks pretty
[1:02:27.320 --> 1:02:33.800]  tasty compared to a rotten raccoon so I mean I mean yes I'm aware that it's
[1:02:33.800 --> 1:02:36.920]  designed for people that are already in our movement you know who already have
[1:02:36.920 --> 1:02:41.480]  our views I think it's great and it's designed to look cheesy and to make us
[1:02:41.480 --> 1:02:45.200]  look like we're nuts to other people but that's fine because I know it's gonna
[1:02:45.200 --> 1:02:49.300]  bring people to us so they find out what we're really about and not this
[1:02:49.300 --> 1:02:54.440]  distortion it's not set up as a counterculture now but it's something that
[1:02:54.440 --> 1:02:58.920]  we can't be denied anymore we're not cooks we're not conspiracy theorists
[1:02:58.920 --> 1:03:04.480]  we're not unintellectual I mean yeah you've always got chicken-necked people
[1:03:04.480 --> 1:03:08.400]  who are lazy like this New York Times writer I'm gonna cover who are in their
[1:03:08.400 --> 1:03:11.440]  little ivory towers they're really in a mental institution looking out on the
[1:03:11.440 --> 1:03:15.480]  rest of us on the street who actually live in the world and calling us crazy
[1:03:15.480 --> 1:03:19.480]  you know because they it's kind of Marie Antoinette saying let them eat cake
[1:03:19.480 --> 1:03:25.280]  they think we're crazy and so it's only about reinforcing kind of the
[1:03:25.280 --> 1:03:32.080]  establishment's coterie of ninnies to you know not wake up but go ahead yeah
[1:03:32.080 --> 1:03:36.400]  and I was watching it you know trying to think of being somebody that would be
[1:03:36.400 --> 1:03:39.640]  outside of it and there was a few things that they said well you kind of thought
[1:03:39.640 --> 1:03:42.960]  well yeah now they're just making fun of you but one and they didn't take a
[1:03:42.960 --> 1:03:46.080]  stance one way or another they just tried to cover it and be like okay well
[1:03:46.080 --> 1:03:48.960]  these are these people and this is what they believe and this is what they're
[1:03:48.960 --> 1:03:52.480]  doing but I'm glad you got that kind of FaceTime and I think that will bring
[1:03:52.480 --> 1:03:56.640]  more people to your radio show your websites your documentaries and I you
[1:03:56.640 --> 1:04:01.000]  don't hear it enough buddy but thank you thank you so much no thank you thank

[1:07:18.560 --> 1:07:22.640]  losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own

[1:08:31.040 --> 1:08:34.440]  bring all the kids in and sit there and interrogate them this happens nationwide
[1:08:34.440 --> 1:08:38.720]  they take your kids in multiple times a year and says mommy rude to you as daddy
[1:08:38.720 --> 1:08:43.120]  and rude to you does anybody touch you they're their secret policing and you
[1:08:43.120 --> 1:08:47.160]  better hope your kid doesn't when they're five or six or seven years old or
[1:08:47.160 --> 1:08:50.280]  eight years old you know doesn't just say yes to them because you know little
[1:08:50.280 --> 1:08:55.680]  kids will say anything because they want your kids that's what these people want
[1:08:55.680 --> 1:08:59.760]  and before I take more calls we got the parents guide to a child protective
[1:08:59.760 --> 1:09:05.600]  services investigation that's also in Spanish Texas Department of Family and
[1:09:05.600 --> 1:09:17.920]  Protective Services stock code P2 0571-00000 PS 35,000 July 2007 and it
[1:09:17.920 --> 1:09:20.880]  says in here if you raise your voice to your children they're gonna take your
[1:09:20.880 --> 1:09:26.120]  children says in the booklet now there's no law you can't raise your voice they
[1:09:26.120 --> 1:09:31.040]  don't care they have SWAT teams they have potbellied pedophiles that work for
[1:09:31.040 --> 1:09:35.440]  them that like to grab kids and I'm sorry I call them potbellied pedophiles it's
[1:09:35.440 --> 1:09:39.800]  just it's like it's a it's like they're come out of a mold or something
[1:09:39.800 --> 1:09:43.280]  they're saying you know there's a red fire hydrant down there on the corner of
[1:09:43.280 --> 1:09:48.200]  the street fire hydrants are usually red well CPS workers are usually potbellied
[1:09:48.200 --> 1:09:55.200]  pedophiles it's like saying a blimp is usually gray a tiger is usually orange
[1:09:55.200 --> 1:10:01.800]  with black stripes CPS workers are potbellied pedophiles on average Hitler
[1:10:01.800 --> 1:10:07.920]  had a little mustache CPS workers are potbellied pedophiles water is cold or
[1:10:07.920 --> 1:10:15.880]  good to drink the sky is blue CPS workers are potbellied pedophiles and let me
[1:10:15.880 --> 1:10:20.200]  just tell you something you potbellied pedophiles I know you're so desperate you
[1:10:20.200 --> 1:10:24.520]  potbellied pedophiles and it's come out everywhere the huge statistics of the
[1:10:24.520 --> 1:10:27.960]  masses of pedophiles in the organizations and then there's people
[1:10:27.960 --> 1:10:31.960]  like to be sadistic that you are the most abusive people to children of any
[1:10:31.960 --> 1:10:37.880]  group and I'm sick of you you potbellied pedophiles and we're not playing your
[1:10:37.880 --> 1:10:42.000]  game are you calling us anymore how you do everything for the children yet you
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:46.160]  have you noticed see they're taking people's kids now for yelling at their
[1:10:46.160 --> 1:10:49.680]  children don't go on the street you yell at them oh we're gonna take your child
[1:10:49.680 --> 1:10:54.160]  and put them in a warehouse with a bunch of other kids that'll beat them up and
[1:10:54.160 --> 1:11:02.160]  abuse them and then the potbellies get to have their way all we care the pot
[1:11:02.160 --> 1:11:06.440]  bellies the pot bellies the revenge of the pot bellies but that's how these
[1:11:06.440 --> 1:11:14.120]  sickos work they get badges and power they get control but imagine taking your
[1:11:14.120 --> 1:11:16.520]  children for raising your voice and they told them this the meeting they said if
[1:11:16.520 --> 1:11:20.360]  you raise your voice we will take your child we're gonna be asking her does she
[1:11:20.360 --> 1:11:27.000]  raise her voice does mommy raise the voice you don't do that in America but
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:30.520]  then police can stomp on your head and taser you and scream at you and you know
[1:11:30.520 --> 1:11:34.000]  that's all fine and at school they could scream at you and the teachers can put
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:37.400]  you in headlocks and they can have drills where they unannounced come and
[1:11:37.400 --> 1:11:40.800]  tell you they're terrorists and scare the kids to death and scream at them they
[1:11:40.800 --> 1:11:44.800]  can watch violent stuff on TV and play violent video games but you raise your
[1:11:44.800 --> 1:11:50.400]  voice we take your child I'm digressing as I was just being told about during
[1:11:50.400 --> 1:11:55.280]  the break by the family and then reading this booklet it's always worse than I
[1:11:55.280 --> 1:12:02.180]  even thought but see the sheltered delusional people in America the
[1:12:02.180 --> 1:12:05.600]  professional yuppies that don't have children that live in big metas mega
[1:12:05.600 --> 1:12:10.240]  cities that nitty around all day that you know just watch a movie every night
[1:12:10.240 --> 1:12:13.160]  or go to the bar every night and you know spend all year planning their
[1:12:13.160 --> 1:12:17.040]  vacations they don't know what it's like to be in the control grids being
[1:12:17.040 --> 1:12:21.440]  hunted down in the public schools being hunted down in the blue collar you know
[1:12:21.440 --> 1:12:26.480]  rust zones and rust belts they don't know what it's like to be pulled over right
[1:12:26.480 --> 1:12:30.040]  next to illegal aliens and you go to jail for an expired license but the
[1:12:30.040 --> 1:12:34.200]  illegal alien doesn't for having no license they don't know what it's like
[1:12:34.200 --> 1:12:38.720]  to be in the control grid to be losing everything you got
[1:12:38.720 --> 1:12:47.000]  so I'm gonna cover the New York Times nittying later oh boy Josh in Missouri
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:50.760]  and then we're gonna go to Bob Chapman he's about to be here Josh in Missouri
[1:12:50.760 --> 1:12:58.400]  go ahead yeah go ahead yeah I heard from a reliable source that the banks are
[1:12:58.400 --> 1:13:02.920]  gonna close in November of this year what do you think the best thing to do
[1:13:02.920 --> 1:13:08.280]  to prepare for that well I'm trying to find a cheap piece of property I was
[1:13:08.280 --> 1:13:12.840]  basically in a bad business deal ended up getting four acres of scrub brush but
[1:13:12.840 --> 1:13:17.160]  that I don't think I can stay there I got a family ranch I can go to but I
[1:13:17.160 --> 1:13:19.960]  don't own any of the land so I don't kind of I don't really like being a place
[1:13:19.960 --> 1:13:24.240]  where I don't control it you know my daddy does but I don't like being on
[1:13:24.240 --> 1:13:29.080]  somebody else's land even though my dad's nice about it there's family and
[1:13:29.080 --> 1:13:32.040]  stuff around there who are nice but I still want my own piece of property you
[1:13:32.040 --> 1:13:35.720]  know how it is so there's that issue get a piece of property if you can away from
[1:13:35.720 --> 1:13:42.560]  people with a good well water source on it get gold and silver get firearms and
[1:13:42.560 --> 1:13:47.240]  try to warn everybody about how the bankers are engineering this because if
[1:13:47.240 --> 1:13:52.840]  we politically expose them they're not gonna be able to get away with it all
[1:13:52.840 --> 1:13:56.920]  right thanks thank you God bless you Donovan Terry Kirk and others we're gonna
[1:13:56.920 --> 1:14:00.040]  go to you in a few minutes with Bob Chapman for the rest of the hour the
[1:14:00.040 --> 1:14:04.880]  international forecaster.com finishing up my comment about the CPS trying to
[1:14:04.880 --> 1:14:09.080]  steal one of my employees eight-year-old daughters for a tiny bruise down her
[1:14:09.080 --> 1:14:15.320]  legs so they strip search there and that's confirmed they demanded to have
[1:14:15.320 --> 1:14:18.520]  the meeting so I got a lawyer for them they had the meeting and they said if
[1:14:18.520 --> 1:14:21.120]  you raise your voice to your child we're gonna take your child that is abuse
[1:14:21.120 --> 1:14:27.640]  of course it's not against the law neither spanking but they don't care just
[1:14:27.640 --> 1:14:31.360]  like taking vaccines isn't against the law refusing them isn't against the law
[1:14:31.360 --> 1:14:37.520]  but they'll take your kids I mean this is a rogue criminal group openly and we
[1:14:37.520 --> 1:14:41.920]  have their booklet saying if you raise your voice we'll take your kids but then
[1:14:41.920 --> 1:14:46.360]  integrate that and everything else if you noticed how first 15 years ago they
[1:14:46.360 --> 1:14:50.040]  said dodgeball scares children we're banning it and then we're banning
[1:14:50.040 --> 1:14:53.240]  recess we're banning running we're banning playing we're banning hugging
[1:14:53.240 --> 1:14:58.040]  we're banning high-fives now they're banning shaking hands children in
[1:14:58.040 --> 1:15:06.760]  public schools are more imprisoned than prisoners in medium security prisons
[1:15:06.760 --> 1:15:12.840]  literally I mean right here in Austin you don't shake hands you don't high-five
[1:15:12.840 --> 1:15:18.640]  you don't run on the grass at recess and instead of if you start getting in a
[1:15:18.640 --> 1:15:23.400]  tussle when you're in fifth grade they come arrest you and your life is over
[1:15:23.400 --> 1:15:28.000]  you are putting your children into a school that is like a shooting fish in
[1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:32.920]  a barrel it's like a big hen house where the hens have had their legs cut off and
[1:15:32.920 --> 1:15:37.480]  their beaks chopped off and and it's run by weasels imagine it's a planet run by
[1:15:37.480 --> 1:15:41.920]  weasels and and they're breeding us beakless legless chickens that can't
[1:15:41.920 --> 1:15:46.040]  defend ourselves and the weasels are breeding and there's more and more
[1:15:46.040 --> 1:15:49.760]  weasels having their way and the weasels have TV screens telling the hens
[1:15:49.760 --> 1:15:55.160]  don't resist look I'm no chicken and I'm not going along with us anymore folks
[1:15:55.160 --> 1:15:58.800]  I'm gonna tell you right now the schools are there to turn your children
[1:15:58.800 --> 1:16:02.920]  against you to and I'm not exaggerating this it's all over the news they're
[1:16:02.920 --> 1:16:08.120]  training seven-year-olds to write dossiers on their parents to be tattletales
[1:16:08.120 --> 1:16:15.720]  they give them money in video games the government is scum Bob Chapman they are
[1:16:15.720 --> 1:16:19.720]  turning our children into literal zombies you got to take riddle in Prozac
[1:16:19.720 --> 1:16:24.280]  you go to jail if you get in a fist fight no running no dodgeball everything
[1:16:24.280 --> 1:16:28.040]  banned your parents raise your voice yeah you go to jail cameras in the school
[1:16:28.040 --> 1:16:34.240]  bathrooms why more more Bob Chapman I realized everything is the fact that
[1:16:34.240 --> 1:16:40.040]  people are literally in a days they're under a spell it's outrageous how bad
[1:16:40.040 --> 1:16:45.600]  things have gotten Bob I think it varies from place to place my daughter's a
[1:16:45.600 --> 1:16:50.160]  teacher in Florida and these thoughts are the things are not going on in the
[1:16:50.160 --> 1:16:54.360]  school that she's out of the schools around where she is but there are places
[1:16:54.360 --> 1:16:58.960]  it is going on and obviously you know you're reporting what's going on in
[1:16:58.960 --> 1:17:06.000]  Texas you know there's another aspect to this which feeds upon this post-latent
[1:17:06.000 --> 1:17:12.600]  homosexuality which is very rife among law enforcement and even military people
[1:17:12.600 --> 1:17:19.100]  and you also have the displayed pedophilia that goes on among the
[1:17:19.100 --> 1:17:25.840]  Illuminati and other elitist types such as our ex-presidents George Bush and
[1:17:25.840 --> 1:17:34.280]  Henry Kissinger and recently we find out that the PM the prime minister of
[1:17:34.280 --> 1:17:41.920]  England is also a a flamer as they call him and a aggressive pedophile along
[1:17:41.920 --> 1:17:50.640]  with his buddy Mandy Mendelsohn and you know the list goes on and on and so it
[1:17:50.640 --> 1:17:58.440]  comes from the top and it sprinkles down like poison and it allows these
[1:17:58.440 --> 1:18:06.440]  people with as you described with power to empower them to do these kind of
[1:18:06.440 --> 1:18:14.860]  things to children how do we stop the army of the potbellied pedophiles it's
[1:18:14.860 --> 1:18:22.460]  not easy it's not easy especially in a society where if you go to court and you
[1:18:22.460 --> 1:18:28.100]  bring action against them you you don't get anywhere because we have a two-tiered
[1:18:28.100 --> 1:18:33.440]  court system particularly in the federal area where they were appointed and they
[1:18:33.440 --> 1:18:41.120]  do what they're told and and so it's hard to get anywhere I think it's not a
[1:18:41.120 --> 1:18:48.440]  very nice solution but it's my belief that unless a couple of things happen
[1:18:48.440 --> 1:18:53.900]  here over the next year or so it'll end up in the street anyway and a couple of
[1:18:53.900 --> 1:19:02.000]  things are happy to report and as you know Alex I've been doing a lot all over
[1:19:02.000 --> 1:19:08.120]  Fox and ABC and so on and so forth over the last two or three weeks on Ron Paul's
[1:19:08.120 --> 1:19:14.440]  bill to audit the Federal Reserve and I'm happy to say there's a hundred and
[1:19:14.440 --> 1:19:20.720]  seventy-nine sponsors and when I started this thing and I'm not saying it's
[1:19:20.720 --> 1:19:26.360]  because I started doing this but it's all of us together yeah yeah it they
[1:19:26.360 --> 1:19:31.880]  were a hundred and twenty and now we got one seven and hey I said a hundred and
[1:19:31.880 --> 1:19:37.600]  twenty last week it's up to a hundred and hundred and what seventy-nine it's on
[1:19:37.600 --> 1:19:40.920]  his site ladies and gentlemen we're gonna get the audit of the Fed if they
[1:19:40.920 --> 1:19:46.200]  don't set a new cough and claim that a cave-dweller did it because the potbelly
[1:19:46.200 --> 1:19:50.960]  pedophiles will not turn loose of power easily they will throw fits and stage
[1:19:50.960 --> 1:19:56.000]  attacks to make everybody cozy up to the potbelly pedophiles from the front

[1:24:25.640 --> 1:24:32.320]  good shopping on air today hi Bob and not digressing often to the type of
[1:24:32.320 --> 1:24:36.480]  people the globalist hire this happened in Nazi Germany Russia everywhere it's
[1:24:36.480 --> 1:24:43.480]  always sickos you know sadistic sadist pedophiles people that serve evil what
[1:24:43.480 --> 1:24:47.880]  about the economy I mean it's all over the news kind of making us pass say what
[1:24:47.880 --> 1:24:53.160]  we were talking about many years ago about dumping the dollar GM's supposed
[1:24:53.160 --> 1:24:58.920]  to go bankrupt next month Chrysler's already gone bankrupt massive job layoffs
[1:24:58.920 --> 1:25:04.480]  accelerating they have this overlay of news about how the economy is getting
[1:25:04.480 --> 1:25:08.760]  better what do you really see happening and on top of that gold is exploded as
[1:25:08.760 --> 1:25:14.560]  you know up to 960 well everybody that's talking about the economy that's on
[1:25:14.560 --> 1:25:19.480]  cnbc in the major media networks is all they're all lying but they won't be
[1:25:19.480 --> 1:25:25.760]  lying for 22 months so they consistent yes they're forcing our general modus
[1:25:25.760 --> 1:25:31.200]  into bankruptcy so they can spin off the good stuff tell some of the good stuff
[1:25:31.200 --> 1:25:37.480]  and and put it to rest if you may by the way they admit that that's in the AP
[1:25:37.480 --> 1:25:42.720]  today that the government is making them go bankrupt that's right it's not the
[1:25:42.720 --> 1:25:46.640]  place of government to do that but when you're in a fascist society that's what
[1:25:46.640 --> 1:25:52.600]  happens and so they're going to continue to produce in China and Brazil and
[1:25:52.600 --> 1:25:57.440]  probably other places under their new moniker so to speak all in a back up it's
[1:25:57.440 --> 1:26:01.520]  there's no probably they've said that GM will now be Chinese cars so we're
[1:26:01.520 --> 1:26:06.640]  paying to have a move to China and Brazil well it's interesting I wrote
[1:26:06.640 --> 1:26:12.640]  about that four years ago and I said that in 2010 the first 300,000 cars
[1:26:12.640 --> 1:26:17.440]  would be manufactured by GM to be shipped into the United States and that's
[1:26:17.440 --> 1:26:21.600]  exactly what's going to happen and that they would once they went out of
[1:26:21.600 --> 1:26:28.320]  business that they would produce in Brazil and in China and so that's what's
[1:26:28.320 --> 1:26:32.720]  happened you know you and I are way ahead of the curve all the time anyway
[1:26:32.720 --> 1:26:38.920]  it as far as gold exploding technically it's in a reverse head and shoulders as
[1:26:38.920 --> 1:26:46.680]  well as the HUI which is an index of stocks which are unhinged
[1:26:46.680 --> 1:26:52.560]  sometimes the gold and silver money companies and others will sell production
[1:26:52.560 --> 1:27:01.480]  forward for two reasons of the one to to get cash or to make get a loan made or
[1:27:01.480 --> 1:27:07.960]  to rig the market and the case of Barrick gold they're rigging the market and I
[1:27:07.960 --> 1:27:13.600]  complained about that since 1992 but very few people have listened the HUI is
[1:27:13.600 --> 1:27:18.600]  also in a reverse head and shoulders just like silver and gold they're all
[1:27:18.600 --> 1:27:23.120]  ready to break out they're right on the cusp right now and the only thing that
[1:27:23.120 --> 1:27:27.040]  can stop it from happening would be massive intervention by the United
[1:27:27.040 --> 1:27:32.800]  States government because the buying is very very heavy and so sooner or later
[1:27:32.800 --> 1:27:36.480]  this thing's got to break out over a thousand we'll use gold as a guideline
[1:27:36.480 --> 1:27:41.480]  and I'll tell you if you're not in this is your last chance because once this
[1:27:41.480 --> 1:27:46.760]  thing breaks up over a thousand it's going to fly the professionals are
[1:27:46.760 --> 1:27:52.520]  starting to come in as I forecast that they would they're coming in in a big
[1:27:52.520 --> 1:27:58.000]  way there's one mutual fund hedge fund excuse me that has almost one-third of
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:28:03.000]  all their assets in gold and silver related assets now and it's the best
[1:28:03.000 --> 1:28:09.920]  performing hedge fund it's called Paulson anyway yeah Bob let me to your
[1:28:09.920 --> 1:28:14.160]  horn for you said about a month ago here on the show when gold was down you said
[1:28:14.160 --> 1:28:18.680]  you expect in the next month and a half that it would test 960 I remember that
[1:28:18.680 --> 1:28:22.400]  and then here we are how high do you think it's going to go before they play
[1:28:22.400 --> 1:28:27.000]  games or what you said last week are the central banks almost sold out of their
[1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:31.200]  gold that they've been using to manipulate the price downward and has the
[1:28:31.200 --> 1:28:35.400]  Chinese and others the Arabs demanding their gold out of the central banks is
[1:28:35.400 --> 1:28:43.120]  that causing a crisis here well I think it adds to the mix and if you've noticed
[1:28:43.120 --> 1:28:50.320]  that the the European banks under the the old Washington agreement it was as
[1:28:50.320 --> 1:28:56.920]  it was called can sell 500 tons of gold a year as a group and they get allocations
[1:28:56.920 --> 1:29:08.760]  to do that and that adds up to about 9000 tons a week excuse me 900 tons a
[1:29:08.760 --> 1:29:13.240]  week it's which one of the other I can't remember but anyway they're doing
[1:29:13.240 --> 1:29:18.880]  like 10% of that so for the last six months or so they haven't been selling
[1:29:18.880 --> 1:29:22.960]  hardly any gold at all which tells me they either don't have it and they don't
[1:29:22.960 --> 1:29:28.680]  want to let it go anymore and in a depression in the real economy you still
[1:29:28.680 --> 1:29:33.280]  have metals rising so they're going against the tide well that they do
[1:29:33.280 --> 1:29:39.800]  both we're into entering into a hyperinflationary phase the Treasury and
[1:29:39.800 --> 1:29:46.480]  the Fed have committed themselves to the expense of 14.8 trillion dollars stay
[1:29:46.480 --> 1:29:49.480]  there we got a break we got a break we come back finish up with that Bob

[1:33:50.640 --> 1:33:59.360]  the break well the committed to 13.8 trillion excuse me 14.8 trillion now and
[1:33:59.360 --> 1:34:05.600]  it just announced that the FOMC which is the federal open market committee which
[1:34:05.600 --> 1:34:10.600]  is the representatives of the 12 federally preserved banks which own the
[1:34:10.600 --> 1:34:15.200]  Federal Reserve and they're talking about before the end of the year my guess
[1:34:15.200 --> 1:34:20.080]  is before the end of the summer that they're going to spend 1.75 trillion
[1:34:20.080 --> 1:34:30.400]  additional bailing different entities out and buying this garbage bonds on the
[1:34:30.400 --> 1:34:36.080]  exchanges Bob stop right there speaking of garbage bonds you've got a garbage
[1:34:36.080 --> 1:34:41.720]  line it's even worse than it was call us call us right back again okay let's see
[1:34:41.720 --> 1:34:46.280]  what's better this time sorry and then when Bob calls back in about one minute
[1:34:46.280 --> 1:34:52.480]  from his undisclosed third world country location we will he's a great
[1:34:52.480 --> 1:34:56.480]  analyst had the biggest silver and gold brokerage firm biggest newsletter and
[1:34:56.480 --> 1:35:00.880]  I went into retirement and came back out of retirement now lives abroad he's in
[1:35:00.880 --> 1:35:05.240]  different parts of the world different seasons of the year and he's got a
[1:35:05.240 --> 1:35:08.120]  really bad phone line today it's normally a very good phone line but I
[1:35:08.120 --> 1:35:13.120]  guess this country isn't too good where he's at right now I wanted to bring up
[1:35:13.120 --> 1:35:18.040]  the triple a rating because they're running around saying oh do whatever the
[1:35:18.040 --> 1:35:21.200]  bankers want give us total power over your lives or we'll lose our triple a
[1:35:21.200 --> 1:35:24.880]  rating and have a depression remember they said give us a blank check and no
[1:35:24.880 --> 1:35:28.920]  oversight no one can investigate us on October 3rd or we'll have a depression
[1:35:28.920 --> 1:35:33.600]  next week and then they stole 14.8 trillion so far seven months later and
[1:35:33.600 --> 1:35:37.560]  we're in worse shape and it'll get worse and worse and they'll give us new
[1:35:37.560 --> 1:35:41.200]  politicians and they'll promise to fix it it'll get worse and worse because they
[1:35:41.200 --> 1:35:50.560]  all come from the same mothership they all were laid by the same goose they're
[1:35:50.560 --> 1:35:54.920]  all chips off the same block they're apples off the same apple tree what
[1:35:54.920 --> 1:35:59.800]  other ridiculous parallels and analogies and parables can I engage in here
[1:35:59.800 --> 1:36:06.520]  offshore private banks have hijacked the planet they control the military and
[1:36:06.520 --> 1:36:10.480]  most of the police departments of the country they control most nations they
[1:36:10.480 --> 1:36:16.680]  brag they're on record it's all over the news and they're gonna give us no
[1:36:16.680 --> 1:36:23.560]  quarter they don't want us to have good lives they don't want us to be free now
[1:36:23.560 --> 1:36:26.440]  I know a lot of police and military aren't part of this and we salute those
[1:36:26.440 --> 1:36:30.360]  of you that are fighting against it we understand that they haven't been able
[1:36:30.360 --> 1:36:34.280]  to carry out pure tyranny yet because most of you won't go along with it and
[1:36:34.280 --> 1:36:42.080]  a lot of the citizens won't go along with it that is why they need to come
[1:36:42.080 --> 1:36:45.480]  out and have all these TV shows and movies where torture is good and secret
[1:36:45.480 --> 1:36:50.360]  arrest is good and then in the real world not just in dramas was suspended
[1:36:50.360 --> 1:36:54.680]  disbelief with 24 and all these other shows but in the real world they come
[1:36:54.680 --> 1:36:59.320]  out and explain to you why torture is good for eight years and why torturing
[1:36:59.320 --> 1:37:02.600]  people's children in front of their parents is good and then now Obama comes
[1:37:02.600 --> 1:37:06.800]  out and says well I'm against that but I am for secret arrest secret detention
[1:37:06.800 --> 1:37:10.600]  and harsh interrogation which is terror which is torture so they play all these
[1:37:10.600 --> 1:37:16.040]  semantical games and then Obama and Cheney have this head-to-head debate
[1:37:16.040 --> 1:37:21.600]  head-to-head dueling speeches to make it look like the left and right are fighting
[1:37:21.600 --> 1:37:25.120]  with each other because that's how the establishment stays in power because if
[1:37:25.120 --> 1:37:29.520]  you ever realize they're all working for each other on the same team it's over so
[1:37:29.520 --> 1:37:34.320]  it's like two actors having a fight and Dick Cheney with his incredibly low
[1:37:34.320 --> 1:37:40.480]  approval rating knows it's probably even Karl Rove's idea that doing all of this
[1:37:40.480 --> 1:37:44.560]  and coming out and attacking Obama will make the torture position look good and
[1:37:44.560 --> 1:37:48.760]  what is Obama's torture position we're gonna protect Bush and protect the
[1:37:48.760 --> 1:37:52.400]  White House lawyers and protect Cheney for breaking the law and ordering the
[1:37:52.400 --> 1:37:56.960]  torture of people and their children incredible Nuremberg you know type
[1:37:56.960 --> 1:38:03.160]  crimes open and shut case so see Obama says I'm protecting you I'm gonna block
[1:38:03.160 --> 1:38:07.720]  this I'm gonna continue secret arrest I'm gonna continue secret detention I'm
[1:38:07.720 --> 1:38:12.240]  gonna keep black sites and ghost sites open worldwide but by Cheney coming on
[1:38:12.240 --> 1:38:18.120]  and attacking him that gives Obama the cover this is elementary brainwashing
[1:38:18.120 --> 1:38:23.680]  it's elementary Bob Chapman will see if your lines better back to the economy
[1:38:23.680 --> 1:38:29.360]  losing the triple a rating GM going under 600 plus thousand jobs being lost
[1:38:29.360 --> 1:38:36.280]  a month month after month inflation went really about 18% I mean this is
[1:38:36.280 --> 1:38:40.440]  cratering quickly Bob you've been saying you thought and other analysts have
[1:38:40.440 --> 1:38:44.200]  agreed that maybe the stimulus would stave off total collapse and we would
[1:38:44.200 --> 1:38:50.240]  just slide into a slow depression but are you revising that or are you saying
[1:38:50.240 --> 1:38:56.840]  this is like compared to what's coming well I'm not revising anything because
[1:38:56.840 --> 1:39:02.840]  I have found over a period of time that these people are very good at what they
[1:39:02.840 --> 1:39:09.040]  do and so they're gonna have to go into major inflation to stave off what's
[1:39:09.040 --> 1:39:13.720]  going on I heard the rumors and information that come out of the
[1:39:13.720 --> 1:39:19.800]  the Bilderberger meeting that they were going to have a quick depression and it
[1:39:19.800 --> 1:39:23.520]  was over with because they were concerned that they couldn't control it now
[1:39:23.520 --> 1:39:27.800]  that was confirmed sources that that no that's confirmed Bob you're right yeah
[1:39:27.800 --> 1:39:33.200]  and and and I disagree I don't think they can do it I don't think they control
[1:39:33.200 --> 1:39:38.160]  control it one of the other things I wanted to address this morning this
[1:39:38.160 --> 1:39:44.280]  afternoon is that we had another bank failure the largest in some time number
[1:39:44.280 --> 1:39:54.000]  34 for the year old 12.6 billion in assets deposits of 4.6 billion question
[1:39:54.000 --> 1:40:01.160]  number one why is this bank being allowed to go under when the 19 major banks in
[1:40:01.160 --> 1:40:06.720]  the country of all been at least temporarily saved by injections from the
[1:40:06.720 --> 1:40:10.680]  the the federal reserve that's right they're really insolvent and so they're
[1:40:10.680 --> 1:40:14.960]  using taxpayer money to gobble up all the little healthy banks as you said two
[1:40:14.960 --> 1:40:20.520]  years ago they would do an even mainstream media admits that big corporate
[1:40:20.520 --> 1:40:24.420]  well I learned telegraph few days ago big corporate raiders are using this
[1:40:24.420 --> 1:40:30.440]  banker bailout as cover to actually raid their healthy smaller competition and
[1:40:30.440 --> 1:40:36.400]  then give the the the pieces to themselves I mean this is just incredibly
[1:40:36.400 --> 1:40:41.080]  simple to bear that out Alex because the next thing I was going to tell you that
[1:40:41.080 --> 1:40:48.800]  this bank largest in Florida is being taken over by a consortium and one of
[1:40:48.800 --> 1:40:54.400]  them is Blackstone the other is Carlisle Corporation and the third I can't
[1:40:54.400 --> 1:40:59.640]  remember the name of it but they're all involved in the Illuminati and so they
[1:40:59.640 --> 1:41:03.560]  go just like you just said that I said two years ago they're going to go in and
[1:41:03.560 --> 1:41:10.000]  gobble it all up for pennies on the dollar because they control the federal
[1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:15.120]  regulators well that's right now now of course we don't hear about all the other
[1:41:15.120 --> 1:41:20.560]  banks that quietly go under they just get taken over well they merge them and
[1:41:20.560 --> 1:41:26.560]  this is why Ron Paul's 1207 is so important go to every a man member of
[1:41:26.560 --> 1:41:30.680]  the house home you want it on a committee you want it passed badge of them to
[1:41:30.680 --> 1:41:37.800]  death because it's working we just went from 120 to 179 co-sponsors we're doing
[1:41:37.800 --> 1:41:42.240]  the right thing yeah we can help us big time we need a headline on that at
[1:41:42.240 --> 1:41:48.520]  prisonplanet.com or info wars.com 179 sponsors if they get what another 50
[1:41:48.520 --> 1:41:52.760]  or so they're going to be able to pass this in the house and then can you
[1:41:52.760 --> 1:41:58.120]  imagine the Senate voting it down the political firestorm as we educate the
[1:41:58.120 --> 1:42:03.360]  public that a private bank rules us has engineered the crisis and that we're not
[1:42:03.360 --> 1:42:07.800]  allowed to audit them and if anybody denies it we have Bernanke and Greenspan
[1:42:07.800 --> 1:42:13.480]  and all of these people on TV saying we're above the law no agency no
[1:42:13.480 --> 1:42:20.240]  government no branch of government no one can audit us and in private lawsuits
[1:42:20.240 --> 1:42:24.800]  you can't sue I mean this is ridiculous I mean are they the new divine right of
[1:42:24.800 --> 1:42:30.160]  kings absolutely and it's the same with the Bank of England and the same things
[1:42:30.160 --> 1:42:36.920]  going on in England right now in fact I have a piece in tomorrow's issue 24% of
[1:42:36.920 --> 1:42:43.400]  the population is considering leaving the UK most of them to New Zealand and
[1:42:43.400 --> 1:42:48.320]  Australia and Canada but the point is they want out and you mentioned earlier
[1:42:48.320 --> 1:42:54.000]  about the seven-year-olds spying and so on I have that in there as well along
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:43:00.200]  with a tape on it and I think they're worse off in England right now we haven't
[1:43:00.200 --> 1:43:05.200]  reached that level yet well also another trick they use they're going after a few
[1:43:05.200 --> 1:43:11.240]  members of parliaments for $200 steak dinners or you know one guy's paying
[1:43:11.240 --> 1:43:15.960]  for his boyfriend's house that all sounds bad but they're using that to bully
[1:43:15.960 --> 1:43:21.880]  parliament you notice MI5 has been caught and the shadow military
[1:43:21.880 --> 1:43:26.520]  national complex has been caught spying on parliament using the surveillance NSA
[1:43:26.520 --> 1:43:32.080]  type systems they have to spy so you have trillion stolen by their government
[1:43:32.080 --> 1:43:39.000]  and so they're just distracting everybody with a fake scandal over the potbellies
[1:43:39.000 --> 1:43:42.720]  you know low-level potbellies and and and you know some of the you know evil
[1:43:42.720 --> 1:43:47.200]  stuff they've got I mean what do you call that tactic I I see them do that over
[1:43:47.200 --> 1:43:55.680]  and over again Bob well I want to add to that MI5 has and this is true testimony
[1:43:55.680 --> 1:44:02.800]  by individuals they were going after Muslims and saying if you don't spy for
[1:44:02.800 --> 1:44:09.480]  us or you don't help us then we're gonna tell you know the the policing
[1:44:09.480 --> 1:44:15.160]  organizations that you're a terrorist and we're gonna put you away and send you
[1:44:15.160 --> 1:44:20.080]  to one of these camps to be waterboarded and I have a big piece on that coming in
[1:44:20.080 --> 1:44:29.760]  and tomorrow's edition as well and and and this is all part of a terribly
[1:44:29.760 --> 1:44:35.440]  terribly corrupt structure not only in the United States but in England in fact
[1:44:35.440 --> 1:44:46.960]  probably 98% of the police in the UK are mason's and they run law enforcement
[1:44:46.960 --> 1:44:53.760]  not MI5 and MI6 but the local and the county and stuff like that and there
[1:44:53.760 --> 1:44:58.520]  was a big expose they written about oh maybe 20 25 years ago they've had
[1:44:58.520 --> 1:45:03.080]  hundreds of articles even in the major news that they can commit murders I mean
[1:45:03.080 --> 1:45:07.000]  over there definitely the mason's run things and they just do whatever they
[1:45:07.000 --> 1:45:12.120]  want period when you know that poor soul they grabbed in the subway they
[1:45:12.120 --> 1:45:16.000]  beat him after that and then shot him about six times and the guy didn't do
[1:45:16.000 --> 1:45:23.960]  anything and then the person who shot him the policeman he was elevated and
[1:45:23.960 --> 1:45:29.240]  given a commendation for cold-bloodedly murdering this poor soul who is lying
[1:45:29.240 --> 1:45:34.400]  on his back on the subway platform yeah you can debate all day what this mason
[1:45:34.400 --> 1:45:37.920]  groups doing or what that mason groups doing but in England there's no doubt and
[1:45:37.920 --> 1:45:43.120]  that it's almost every judge you can't even be a practicing barrister unless you
[1:45:43.120 --> 1:45:48.680]  are and it's just a good old boy club there's certainly no doubt about that
[1:45:48.680 --> 1:45:54.040]  going on in England it is just absolutely a travesty we're gonna go to
[1:45:54.040 --> 1:45:58.240]  calls Bob and I wanted to ask you this question they're hyping that we're gonna
[1:45:58.240 --> 1:46:02.680]  lose our triple a rating and it's clear that you know you go back to October
[1:46:02.680 --> 1:46:05.560]  last year when they were saying we're gonna have a depression that finally
[1:46:05.560 --> 1:46:10.240]  destroyed confidence in the big landslide collapse accelerated now
[1:46:10.240 --> 1:46:13.040]  they're hyping that we're gonna have a bigger depression and that we're gonna
[1:46:13.040 --> 1:46:16.760]  lose our triple a rating and the dollars dead and our own government's making
[1:46:16.760 --> 1:46:21.640]  noises like that and then countries are leaving we know the bank is offshore we
[1:46:21.640 --> 1:46:26.960]  know they want to terminate the US but it looks like Geithner is actually trying
[1:46:26.960 --> 1:46:31.080]  to make sure the US doesn't recover by running around badmouthing the triple a
[1:46:31.080 --> 1:46:37.280]  rating that's correct but it's exposed facto all the professionals know I
[1:46:37.280 --> 1:46:43.840]  mean I predicted I picked a very top on the US DX index for those of you don't
[1:46:43.840 --> 1:46:48.920]  know what that is it's six currencies versus the dollar major currencies and
[1:46:48.920 --> 1:46:55.080]  they run a weighted basis so the US DX recently over the last several months
[1:46:55.080 --> 1:47:01.920]  reached a new interim high of 8950 I said that's it that's the top from here
[1:47:01.920 --> 1:47:08.360]  on it's going down well it's about 80 and a half right now and it's going down
[1:47:08.360 --> 1:47:16.440]  expeditiously and so it's really after the fact they were admitting that the
[1:47:16.440 --> 1:47:23.640]  the the rating is going down but it's already baked into the cake the
[1:47:23.640 --> 1:47:28.880]  breakdowns already begun the smart money was shorting the US DX they were
[1:47:28.880 --> 1:47:33.760]  going long gold and silver and they were shorting the market in here which is
[1:47:33.760 --> 1:47:39.200]  hanging on by its fingernails at 8340 on the Dow it's going back and testing
[1:47:39.200 --> 1:47:44.920]  6600 in its going lower and they know it all right let's take calls let's talk
[1:47:44.920 --> 1:47:53.480]  to Terry and Canada Terry you're on the air yes Alex yes sir yeah Alex I like
[1:47:53.480 --> 1:47:57.960]  to commend your work and in force your thank you definitely for their work
[1:47:57.960 --> 1:48:04.160]  thank you and also what kind of brought me around was the harassment I know you
[1:48:04.160 --> 1:48:09.200]  go through it yourself and with the prompt of this phone call I've heard
[1:48:09.200 --> 1:48:13.160]  you talk different times about your family and that and it happened to my
[1:48:13.160 --> 1:48:19.080]  family I actually said no to a criminal element and found out about
[1:48:19.080 --> 1:48:22.960]  harassment can you comment on that well I just hope they don't fall down and
[1:48:22.960 --> 1:48:28.160]  bump their head never wake up because I mean I don't know really what you can
[1:48:28.160 --> 1:48:31.680]  say I don't know how they harassed you or what they did but but in my
[1:48:31.680 --> 1:48:36.840]  experience when you attack somebody back these people are cowards they only
[1:48:36.840 --> 1:48:40.960]  like they're only tough when somebody's tied to a chair as somebody said in the
[1:48:40.960 --> 1:48:44.720]  comment pages of info wars I read they're only tough when somebody's tied to a
[1:48:44.720 --> 1:48:51.640]  chair the sadist you know it's just like bullies when you start you know at
[1:48:51.640 --> 1:48:54.880]  first a bully when you start fighting back you'll punch him a few times and
[1:48:54.880 --> 1:48:58.440]  they'll still still be going at you but then you hear him start whimpering when
[1:48:58.440 --> 1:49:02.720]  you don't care if they're hurting you you're gonna bring them down and you know
[1:49:02.720 --> 1:49:06.560]  whether that's calling them or following them around with a camera or getting
[1:49:06.560 --> 1:49:11.200]  aggressive with them you know I mean that you got to decide you don't care
[1:49:11.200 --> 1:49:15.240]  it's almost a spirit of I don't care you want to you know you want to get into
[1:49:15.240 --> 1:49:18.840]  it let's go Bob Chapman I mean I don't want to sit or advise people about what
[1:49:18.840 --> 1:49:24.600]  I do with people that harass me well I would have died to avoid them as much as
[1:49:24.600 --> 1:49:29.960]  possible even if it takes moving to another place even out of the country
[1:49:29.960 --> 1:49:34.760]  yeah that's always smart you know it goes back to 1967 and it's been rently
[1:49:34.760 --> 1:49:42.360]  relentless and it's never stopped and but come on you want me come on the same
[1:49:42.360 --> 1:49:46.840]  attitude you are I am not gonna back off but then again I don't have young
[1:49:46.840 --> 1:49:53.720]  children and and and and things that they can use against me like most other
[1:49:53.720 --> 1:49:58.360]  people have well discretion is the discretion is the greater part of
[1:49:58.360 --> 1:50:03.600]  Valor I mean I agree play it smart but if somebody doesn't give you a choice you
[1:50:03.600 --> 1:50:07.080]  know we die a thousand deaths and things are not when you give in to being pushed
[1:50:07.080 --> 1:50:10.920]  around and that's why you know I'm probably too aggressive sometimes I'm
[1:50:10.920 --> 1:50:15.880]  just like because it's much easier just to attack right back and I and I think
[1:50:15.880 --> 1:50:19.160]  that's the policy I mean what type of what type of harassment are they giving
[1:50:19.160 --> 1:50:23.920]  you yeah well actually I like to something called it's criminal stocking
[1:50:23.920 --> 1:50:28.960]  they call it group stocking gang stocking if you get that's googled that's
[1:50:28.960 --> 1:50:33.920]  what woke me up your show and and reading about other people's account you're in
[1:50:33.920 --> 1:50:38.120]  your home I'm just an average guy retired just retired you're in your home

[1:50:49.080 --> 1:50:53.560]  appreciate your call there is such a thing as in small towns especially that

[1:55:54.440 --> 1:56:01.800]  up Alex hi Bob welcome hey I'm just a couple things first of all Alex a great
[1:56:01.800 --> 1:56:06.440]  show yesterday with us the body didn't sure and Dr. Paul so I want to thank you
[1:56:06.440 --> 1:56:13.400]  for that but I saw a TSA that the PSA is gonna take over subway checks from the
[1:56:13.400 --> 1:56:17.960]  NYPD yeah they're doing a nation man remembers six years ago I saw Governor
[1:56:17.960 --> 1:56:22.600]  Ridge of Homeland Security say on C-Span and a meeting with governors that
[1:56:22.600 --> 1:56:27.360]  they're gonna have airport security at malls sidewalks are called Viper
[1:56:27.360 --> 1:56:32.840]  teams everywhere you will be stopped search this is the new America you know
[1:56:32.840 --> 1:56:36.680]  it I haven't seen anybody reporting on it was basically on my Fox New York but
[1:56:36.680 --> 1:56:41.680]  if you Google TSA subway NYPD you'll get you'll get the other feds are
[1:56:41.680 --> 1:56:45.840]  federalizing yes yes I in fact Google that right now guys what are they
[1:56:45.840 --> 1:56:54.960]  Google to find it a TSA subway NYPD okay TSA subway NYPD TSA subway NYPD I
[1:56:54.960 --> 1:56:59.320]  mean I know this is true and again I'm not tooting my horn saying oh look we
[1:56:59.320 --> 1:57:02.800]  were right my point is this has been a long time coming it's happening and
[1:57:02.800 --> 1:57:06.000]  yeah you got to teach your kids how to be searched by men in uniforms that's
[1:57:06.000 --> 1:57:09.240]  freedom didn't you know we got to keep you safe from Al Qaeda but all the actual
[1:57:09.240 --> 1:57:13.760]  Homeland Security training is for conservatives and gun owners man and my
[1:57:13.760 --> 1:57:19.720]  second point is Rachel Maddow yesterday she really picked apart Obama on MSNBC
[1:57:19.720 --> 1:57:23.840]  and this is really on characteristic of her but she did it so I would check that
[1:57:23.840 --> 1:57:28.760]  out some of the Daily Paul calm yeah I'm getting a lot of emails about all of
[1:57:28.760 --> 1:57:33.640]  this because supposedly Stewart and her and others are now admitting Obama's a
[1:57:33.640 --> 1:57:37.480]  big liar and all the police state continues I think they're having to do
[1:57:37.480 --> 1:57:41.360]  this because they realize the public isn't buying it Bob do you see the
[1:57:41.360 --> 1:57:47.760]  facade of Obama starting to fall oh I think it fell probably about a month and
[1:57:47.760 --> 1:57:53.680]  a half ago and at that time I predicted his approval rating in October would be
[1:57:53.680 --> 1:58:00.280]  40 as you know Rasmussen came in with 53 after a hundred days and you know you
[1:58:00.280 --> 1:58:04.240]  can't look at the other ones because they're all bought and paid for so he's
[1:58:04.240 --> 1:58:09.640]  on his way down it may be even worse than 40 by October do you think you'll
[1:58:09.640 --> 1:58:16.000]  stage a terror attack as Michael Savage and others are predicting I think so but
[1:58:16.000 --> 1:58:21.280]  I think it'll be a little further on I think they're gonna try a time that's
[1:58:21.280 --> 1:58:28.320]  like they did 9-11 with the the most dreadful status of the economy and
[1:58:28.320 --> 1:58:33.360]  finance and I still think that is a year or two away and I think that's why they
[1:58:33.360 --> 1:58:38.840]  had the trip he had the trip following gay there gotta break 70 seconds one
[1:58:38.840 --> 1:58:46.840]  more second with Bob thank you for listening to GCN be sure to visit GCN

[2:00:12.320 --> 2:00:19.840]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCM radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[2:00:19.840 --> 2:00:37.080]  Alex Jones okay Bob Chapman cut off by the satellite break got a break what
[2:00:37.080 --> 2:00:41.560]  was the point you're making as we went into break I can't remember because I
[2:00:41.560 --> 2:00:44.520]  was thinking about something else you were talking about a stage terror
[2:00:44.520 --> 2:00:51.480]  attacks is plunging that's why that's why they went over Obama and and gates
[2:00:51.480 --> 2:00:55.560]  went over to Israel to tell them what cool it what you're gonna have your war
[2:00:55.560 --> 2:01:02.240]  but we have to time the thing correctly and another thing that went on in the
[2:01:02.240 --> 2:01:09.640]  last few days was the Dubai walked out of the Gulf Council meetings and they
[2:01:09.640 --> 2:01:15.200]  were going to set up and they're still going to a Dina as a regional currency
[2:01:15.200 --> 2:01:22.360]  and Dubai walked out but simultaneously Dubai get approval final
[2:01:22.360 --> 2:01:26.920]  approval of being able to put in a nuclear reactor and of course they can
[2:01:26.920 --> 2:01:34.800]  put one in an Iran can't and I think the give-up gear was Dubai could get the
[2:01:34.800 --> 2:01:41.760]  reactor if they walked out of the council because the US doesn't want a
[2:01:41.760 --> 2:01:46.520]  regional currency there even though there's four other members still
[2:01:46.520 --> 2:01:50.280]  involved and I think they're going to disarm the thing and that's how they're
[2:01:50.280 --> 2:01:55.160]  doing it I got a few other quick little questions for you Bob here in the few
[2:01:55.160 --> 2:01:57.920]  minutes we have left they're going to plug the forecasters so folks at your
[2:01:57.920 --> 2:02:05.760]  pins and paper ready Bob if 600,000 people are losing their jobs every month
[2:02:05.760 --> 2:02:14.120]  and that's gonna start compounding and dragging on the economy more and if all
[2:02:14.120 --> 2:02:19.600]  these other you know problems keep happening in the economy how soon
[2:02:19.600 --> 2:02:25.960]  until we have civil unrest how soon do we see a bank holiday or do you see that
[2:02:25.960 --> 2:02:31.760]  in the cards well I think there will be but I don't think it's short term I see
[2:02:31.760 --> 2:02:35.840]  what they're doing I know what they're doing I see the injection coming from
[2:02:35.840 --> 2:02:43.240]  stimulus I see the injections of money and credit into the system I mean
[2:02:43.240 --> 2:02:48.560]  we'll talk in 14.8 trillion and so I think you're gonna have a flattening out
[2:02:48.560 --> 2:02:54.000]  next year but after that it's gonna get worse again so it's not gonna happen as
[2:02:54.000 --> 2:03:00.560]  quickly as you think and they'll be isolated in incidents perhaps but you
[2:03:00.560 --> 2:03:08.200]  gotta wait until unemployment is over 30% and it's 19.2 to 19.8 right now
[2:03:08.200 --> 2:03:14.680]  that's a use six the real use six figure over 22 by the end of the year the
[2:03:14.680 --> 2:03:20.480]  following year somewhere between 22 and 30 and after that anywhere from 30 to 50
[2:03:20.480 --> 2:03:24.800]  and that's when you're gonna have your trouble okay folks I'm just gonna say
[2:03:24.800 --> 2:03:29.880]  this here at the end my two resources through the weekend bought gold at 880
[2:03:29.880 --> 2:03:34.880]  silver at 13 so that's what's factored into the price of these coins these are
[2:03:34.880 --> 2:03:40.360]  from the market when it was 880 it's now 960 and going up I suggest you call the

[2:09:41.080 --> 2:09:45.400]  gonna go over this review in the New York Times of the film that I'm in called
[2:09:45.400 --> 2:09:49.960]  the New World Order where they savage me Luke Radowski and others I'm not
[2:09:49.960 --> 2:09:54.080]  covering this New York Times attack because it's about me it's a window into
[2:09:54.080 --> 2:09:59.040]  the disconnect between these establishment lackeys in the real world
[2:09:59.040 --> 2:10:06.240]  they think we're delusional just just incredible so that is coming up but
[2:10:06.240 --> 2:10:13.160]  Tony Gosling has Builderburg org he just always has such amazing research
[2:10:13.160 --> 2:10:17.800]  information connections into Builderburg and others to break down what's
[2:10:17.800 --> 2:10:20.720]  happened but I wanted to have him on the data briefly go over the history of
[2:10:20.720 --> 2:10:26.200]  Builderburg and some of his perspectives on that and then any info he's got on
[2:10:26.200 --> 2:10:32.080]  the 2009 meeting that just ended Tony good to have you here with us thanks
[2:10:32.080 --> 2:10:35.680]  for having me on good to have you here yeah I was driving in the car and heard
[2:10:35.680 --> 2:10:38.600]  John George Butler show this weekend and I've you know interviewed you before I
[2:10:38.600 --> 2:10:42.600]  thought man he really is breaking down the history great and bringing on a lot
[2:10:42.600 --> 2:10:45.960]  of things that I didn't even know about I knew about some of it but like the
[2:10:45.960 --> 2:10:50.800]  submarine delivering Nazis and Prince Bernhardt in Canada and all of that was
[2:10:50.800 --> 2:10:55.160]  just it was just really intriguing so I wanted to have you on yeah I mean I think
[2:10:55.160 --> 2:10:57.920]  I'm not sure I see you and you listen to familiar there with the two main
[2:10:57.920 --> 2:11:04.040]  characters behind the first Builderburg meeting what is it Joseph Ratzinger or
[2:11:04.040 --> 2:11:08.840]  Rettinger and then a Bernhardt and then one other
[2:11:08.840 --> 2:11:12.800]  obviously Prince Bernhardt of the Netherlands I mean these two characters
[2:11:12.800 --> 2:11:18.080]  there's quite a lot of come out I mean Bernhardt died about three four years
[2:11:18.080 --> 2:11:22.360]  ago and after that I don't know if you've heard this but there was a
[2:11:22.360 --> 2:11:29.320]  fantastic BBC Radio 4 documentary as part of the series document which looked
[2:11:29.320 --> 2:11:33.280]  really closely at his involvement Bernhard's involvement immediately after
[2:11:33.280 --> 2:11:41.320]  the Second World War in in smuggling Nazi war criminals out of Europe and
[2:11:41.320 --> 2:11:45.320]  across to South America so Bernhardt was actually a key person in that as it
[2:11:45.320 --> 2:11:49.040]  come came out in this documentary and it's you know it's interesting that the
[2:11:49.040 --> 2:11:54.480]  BBC but that was off his death I guess Tony do me a favor and back off your
[2:11:54.480 --> 2:11:57.680]  phone we always have trouble over to England for some reason or maybe it's
[2:11:57.680 --> 2:12:01.160]  the phone system at Genesis again but back off that phone for it so it's not
[2:12:01.160 --> 2:12:08.120]  distorted yeah also yes I was aware of that BBC report multi-part series I
[2:12:08.120 --> 2:12:12.320]  listened to most of it and it was just going off Builderburg's own documents
[2:12:12.320 --> 2:12:16.040]  and what's been released by the Royal House this is not our opinion and I want
[2:12:16.040 --> 2:12:18.720]  you to go through that history for those that may not know it because you're so
[2:12:18.720 --> 2:12:21.960]  good at telling it and have so much research how does that dovetail with
[2:12:21.960 --> 2:12:27.000]  the British and US Army reports about what we already had pieces of about in
[2:12:27.000 --> 2:12:31.520]  the 43-44 the Nazis knew they were gonna lose so they put their money through the
[2:12:31.520 --> 2:12:35.080]  crumps and others into setting up a European Union through dummy
[2:12:35.080 --> 2:12:40.400]  corporations and then in 54 I see it as kind of the Nazi wealth teaming back up
[2:12:40.400 --> 2:12:44.840]  and merging again with the Anglo-American establishment that coming together that
[2:12:44.840 --> 2:12:50.600]  transatlantic Union you know that that's so she can't really say Builderburg is
[2:12:50.600 --> 2:12:57.520]  Nazi it is it is elitist but it has that core group of Nazis in it wanting a
[2:12:57.520 --> 2:13:03.200]  European Union well that's right I mean this is really well put together by this
[2:13:03.200 --> 2:13:09.480]  academic Mike Peters and professor Mike Peters he's he was up at I'm until
[2:13:09.480 --> 2:13:13.320]  recently he's just recently retired the last year or so working up at Leeds
[2:13:13.320 --> 2:13:16.920]  Metropolitan University the old polytechnic up there but he used to run a
[2:13:16.920 --> 2:13:22.600]  magazine called here and now in the 1990s and late 80s and because he he
[2:13:22.600 --> 2:13:26.640]  actually couldn't get the university authorities to publish this paper that he
[2:13:26.640 --> 2:13:29.800]  put together about Builderburg so what he did is he spiced it up a bit made a
[2:13:29.800 --> 2:13:34.960]  little bit more readable and published it in his magazine and it's called
[2:13:34.960 --> 2:13:39.520]  Builderburg and the project for European Unification and it's it starts out
[2:13:39.520 --> 2:13:43.480]  really as a sort of academic pamphlet but it's really very readable and it
[2:13:43.480 --> 2:13:47.720]  goes into all of the sort of nuts and bolts of the initial meetings that led
[2:13:47.720 --> 2:13:51.480]  to people thinking that Builderburg was going to be necessary so we're talking
[2:13:51.480 --> 2:13:56.880]  about back in 1943 the Council on Foreign Relations, War and Peace Study
[2:13:56.880 --> 2:14:02.600]  groups over in the States deciding really that there was a need for a
[2:14:02.600 --> 2:14:06.200]  Builderburg type organization bringing together real prestigious figures, heads
[2:14:06.200 --> 2:14:11.440]  of state but the whole thing right from the beginning was going to be covert
[2:14:11.440 --> 2:14:15.080]  now this was working in parallel with things like the Marshall Plan the
[2:14:15.080 --> 2:14:19.760]  lend lease to the British forces during the Second World War and how that was
[2:14:19.760 --> 2:14:23.080]  going to be paid back and also how Britain and Europe was going to be
[2:14:23.080 --> 2:14:28.440]  rebuilt and this was also tied into the whole European movement the idea that
[2:14:28.440 --> 2:14:35.080]  it was essential to get a political union right across Europe. Now I don't get
[2:14:35.080 --> 2:14:38.880]  involved in Protestants and Catholics fighting I don't get into this word you
[2:14:38.880 --> 2:14:45.600]  know religious craziness and this is a radio show a news program and I have
[2:14:45.600 --> 2:14:50.360]  found that you know there's some crowds out there that obsess on Catholics and
[2:14:50.360 --> 2:14:54.640]  Catholic entry and Catholic secret societies and everybody's a secret agent
[2:14:54.640 --> 2:14:59.360]  of it and so I you know for years thought that was discredited and stupid
[2:14:59.360 --> 2:15:04.080]  and silly because some of the proponents of it were so ridiculous but then
[2:15:04.080 --> 2:15:09.280]  through being attacked I did actually look at it deeper and then I was doing
[2:15:09.280 --> 2:15:14.040]  research for the for in-game on the founding of Builderburg European Union
[2:15:14.040 --> 2:15:18.480]  all of that the Nazi connections the Catholic Church connections the Treaty
[2:15:18.480 --> 2:15:23.760]  of Rome 57 how they say the European Union will be the new Holy Roman Empire
[2:15:23.760 --> 2:15:28.480]  and I went wow that's actually true and then how Tony Blair's converted to
[2:15:28.480 --> 2:15:32.440]  Catholicism so he can be a new EU head and they denied that and now they're
[2:15:32.440 --> 2:15:38.920]  talking about it and then all these weird p2 lodges interconnecting and and
[2:15:38.920 --> 2:15:43.640]  then and then Joseph Reddinger and all of that I mean there really is something
[2:15:43.640 --> 2:15:48.240]  there at the bottom of it quite like that though Alex I mean I what I see is I
[2:15:48.240 --> 2:15:51.920]  see the Catholic Church almost the Vatican kind of beseeched by all these
[2:15:51.920 --> 2:15:56.040]  different organizations I mean the idea of Tony Blair knocking up on your knocking
[2:15:56.040 --> 2:15:59.720]  on the door and wanting to be their friend it is an attempt I think to
[2:15:59.720 --> 2:16:05.480]  influence what is seen as actually quite there are elements certainly within
[2:16:05.480 --> 2:16:10.280]  the Vatican they're very resistant I think to the the you know sort of mass
[2:16:10.280 --> 2:16:14.120]  political politicization of Europe under one so you're saying the European Union
[2:16:14.120 --> 2:16:19.480]  isn't being pushed strongly by the Catholic Church no I don't I don't see
[2:16:19.480 --> 2:16:23.160]  it like that I think there are elements in all of these the churches right
[2:16:23.160 --> 2:16:26.840]  across Europe which are I mean there's a battle going on within those
[2:16:26.840 --> 2:16:30.200]  institutions if you wanted something a little bit like an organization like
[2:16:30.200 --> 2:16:35.400]  the BBC that can come out with a fantastic documentary on one subject
[2:16:35.400 --> 2:16:39.000]  maybe they did a very good job on the baby Kelly story that our long
[2:16:39.000 --> 2:16:42.040]  documentary people haven't seen it you're saying there's different camps
[2:16:42.040 --> 2:16:45.520]  you're saying there's different camps within the same organization and also
[2:16:45.520 --> 2:16:50.000]  they're under assault organized assault from outside so that there are outside
[2:16:50.000 --> 2:16:54.120]  agencies sending you know it's a people to infiltrate these organizations and
[2:16:54.120 --> 2:16:57.640]  influence them exactly I just wanted your opinion and we also notice that it's
[2:16:57.640 --> 2:17:02.760]  all only kosher to attack the Catholic Church and and and very popular and
[2:17:02.760 --> 2:17:07.440]  there's certainly a lot to attack but by the mainstream media that's always
[2:17:07.440 --> 2:17:11.800]  questionable as well I I just seen those I think there's a good reason for
[2:17:11.800 --> 2:17:15.520]  that actually and that is that the Protestant Church is traditionally
[2:17:15.520 --> 2:17:20.960]  welcome Freemasons and lots of the Protestant Church in in certainly here
[2:17:20.960 --> 2:17:24.640]  in Britain I mean I don't know about elsewhere in Scotland as well it's
[2:17:24.640 --> 2:17:28.360]  actually quite normal for Freemasons to be in the church even though they won't
[2:17:28.360 --> 2:17:32.960]  talk about it whereas the Catholics have had many edicts quite whether they're
[2:17:32.960 --> 2:17:36.200]  taking notes or not is another thing but you know papal
[2:17:36.200 --> 2:17:40.440]  declarations against Freemasonry saying that this you know Freemasons cannot be
[2:17:40.440 --> 2:17:43.720]  in the church so I think that's one of the interesting things about this when
[2:17:43.720 --> 2:17:46.920]  I see that I think well hang on a minute you know the product what the
[2:17:46.920 --> 2:17:51.800]  Protestants are doing is ignoring the beam in their own eye
[2:17:51.800 --> 2:17:55.560]  and pointing the finger at the Catholics but this is I think part of the attempts
[2:17:55.560 --> 2:18:00.520]  to kind of get these various quite powerful institutions which are in the
[2:18:00.520 --> 2:18:05.480]  way of all these new world order style changes fighting each other just as
[2:18:05.480 --> 2:18:08.800]  they've been doing obviously in sure sure it's divide and conquer you know
[2:18:08.800 --> 2:18:11.640]  sure it's divide and conquer just like right now they want to be liberal
[2:18:11.640 --> 2:18:16.280]  Democrats and conservative Republicans fighting with each other over left
[2:18:16.280 --> 2:18:19.800]  right when left right are all unified at the top to bring in the new world order
[2:18:19.800 --> 2:18:24.120]  but I didn't mean to have you digress there I just wanted to go into some of
[2:18:24.120 --> 2:18:29.880]  that because wasn't Reddinger like a Jesuit or something well he was a
[2:18:29.880 --> 2:18:34.160]  free I don't know about him being a about being in being a Jesuit but he
[2:18:34.160 --> 2:18:36.760]  certainly was a Freemason and this is one of the interesting things that's
[2:18:36.760 --> 2:18:41.080]  come out I mean we've got quite a good Polish community here in Bristol and I
[2:18:41.080 --> 2:18:43.520]  was chatting some Polish people and they're going all right yeah this guy
[2:18:43.520 --> 2:18:48.240]  Reddinger is big news even though he died such a long time ago you know in Poland
[2:18:48.240 --> 2:18:51.720]  there are people writing books now about him and about how this interesting
[2:18:51.720 --> 2:18:55.920]  Polish born guy was working for MI6 during the Second World War looking
[2:18:55.920 --> 2:19:00.760]  after the Polish leader in exile how he was you know they would be people
[2:19:00.760 --> 2:19:04.920]  picking apart his life as he was growing up in Poland and things like this but
[2:19:04.920 --> 2:19:09.200]  of course this stuff is all only in Polish yeah so I thought one of the
[2:19:09.200 --> 2:19:11.240]  things I'm working on the moment is trying to get some of this stuff out
[2:19:11.240 --> 2:19:16.000]  into the English language I'd stay there Builderburg.org we're gonna have to hold
[2:19:16.000 --> 2:19:19.400]  you longer than 30-40 minutes because I'm really getting intrigued let's get
[2:19:19.400 --> 2:19:24.560]  into what we know about Builderburg how it was founded what its goals are these
[2:19:24.560 --> 2:19:29.360]  army reports that are confirmed about the Nazi money going into it that merger
[2:19:29.360 --> 2:19:32.960]  the Anglo-American establishment with the old European elite with Germany at
[2:19:32.960 --> 2:19:37.920]  the center certainly Germany is the heart of the EU that can't be debated and
[2:19:37.920 --> 2:19:41.760]  so we'll break all that down and then get any latest intel you've got from
[2:19:41.760 --> 2:19:44.520]  England's I know you always get a lot of inside info that's turned out to be
[2:19:44.520 --> 2:19:48.520]  pretty accurate at Builderburg.org Tony Gosling is our guest your calls coming

[2:22:00.280 --> 2:22:06.160]  in the New World Order's war against humanity Barack Obama is the tip of the
[2:22:06.160 --> 2:22:11.480]  spear we've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I

[2:24:25.920 --> 2:24:31.840]  front page of metro and state strip search of eight-year-old girl that we've
[2:24:31.840 --> 2:24:38.160]  been exposing but then it's a different version I guess they went to print
[2:24:38.160 --> 2:24:41.840]  later than the internet store they put out they admit the police contradicted
[2:24:41.840 --> 2:24:44.640]  themselves with the school administration because the school
[2:24:44.640 --> 2:24:48.480]  administration admitted they took her pants off and they admitted that to us
[2:24:48.480 --> 2:24:52.800]  and the CPS admitted it and then now they're denying it saying nobody did I
[2:24:52.800 --> 2:24:59.600]  mean you know you guys just it's not good to lie continually I mean come on
[2:24:59.600 --> 2:25:04.120]  we're not the ones lying you're the ones lying like they've now had to admit I
[2:25:04.120 --> 2:25:09.000]  didn't give out their 911 number I gave out the administrative county numbers so
[2:25:09.000 --> 2:25:12.600]  they've been caught in that lie as well but look just keep lying everybody knows
[2:25:12.600 --> 2:25:18.120]  the liars are you not us does that mean we're perfect no we make mistakes but
[2:25:18.120 --> 2:25:23.400]  you guys are known that when your lips are moving you're lying I'm back to Tony
[2:25:23.400 --> 2:25:27.840]  Gosling of Builderburg.org we can also learn more about the Builderburg in my
[2:25:27.840 --> 2:25:34.440]  film the endgame blueprint for global enslavement okay in a nutshell the
[2:25:34.440 --> 2:25:37.920]  founding of Builderburg from the documents themselves and then the
[2:25:37.920 --> 2:25:41.320]  latest info any intel you've gotten from this year's meeting what's on the
[2:25:41.320 --> 2:25:48.560]  agenda from 2009 the the list this year Alex is the Builderburg press release
[2:25:48.560 --> 2:25:54.480]  have you yes you've seen all that then yeah well we we got their press release
[2:25:54.480 --> 2:25:58.560]  and yeah we put it up yeah okay brilliant because there were a couple of
[2:25:58.560 --> 2:26:01.600]  issues of the press release I mean different languages but yeah I mean
[2:26:01.600 --> 2:26:06.840]  they're talking they were talking this time well at least they say they were
[2:26:06.840 --> 2:26:10.480]  talking about the financial crisis governments and markets role of
[2:26:10.480 --> 2:26:15.240]  institutions market economies and democracy Iraq Pakistan Afghanistan US
[2:26:15.240 --> 2:26:20.520]  and the world cyber terrorism which I guess is their fear of the truth coming
[2:26:20.520 --> 2:26:24.960]  out on the internet manifesting as something called cyber terrorism new
[2:26:24.960 --> 2:26:29.040]  imperialism's protectionism post Kyoto challenges now I don't know about you
[2:26:29.040 --> 2:26:32.280]  but that's the longest list of subjects I've ever seen a one of these Builderburg
[2:26:32.280 --> 2:26:36.280]  press releases and of course the Builderburg style answer to all this is
[2:26:36.280 --> 2:26:42.080]  all these international problems need to be dealt with together by a giant
[2:26:42.080 --> 2:26:47.160]  global governmental type system I mean that's where they're pushing but it
[2:26:47.160 --> 2:26:50.200]  seems every time there's some kind of crisis and this is why they're so into
[2:26:50.200 --> 2:26:54.400]  these created crises here is they're trying to pull it in and say it's okay
[2:26:54.400 --> 2:26:57.560]  we've got a plan to deal with it a little bit like when they appeared at the
[2:26:57.560 --> 2:27:00.320]  beginning of the Second World War they were sort of jumping in they're saying
[2:27:00.320 --> 2:27:04.720]  it's okay we'll deal with it so they're spending a lot of money a lot of time
[2:27:04.720 --> 2:27:09.520]  and effort trying to think ahead of the game and playing a long game I think you
[2:27:09.520 --> 2:27:14.560]  know we need to do too so that the originals that when we were talking a
[2:27:14.560 --> 2:27:19.560]  little bit earlier about the that the U-boat incident do you actually know
[2:27:19.560 --> 2:27:23.960]  about that the the where the Hitler's escape boat you know about that one yes
[2:27:23.960 --> 2:27:27.680]  I had read briefly about it in a few history books but you had more detail
[2:27:27.680 --> 2:27:31.600]  so tell us what I mean I actually came over to the states I think it was in
[2:27:31.600 --> 2:27:36.000]  1999 to check this one out Alex because it seems so intriguing I was having
[2:27:36.000 --> 2:27:41.920]  chats on the phone and getting emails from a guy called Ed Meshaw in I think
[2:27:41.920 --> 2:27:46.240]  it's in Concord Massachusetts he's based but he was doing diving off of Cape Cod
[2:27:46.240 --> 2:27:52.280]  and he's a someone that kind of does research in libraries museums and that
[2:27:52.280 --> 2:27:57.200]  kind of thing into wrecks and he discovered this wreck this this U-boat
[2:27:57.200 --> 2:28:04.400]  which is sunk off Cape Cod on the 25th of August 1944 it was a very special very
[2:28:04.400 --> 2:28:10.240]  peculiar type of U-boat only one of its kind was ever built it's called a type
[2:28:10.240 --> 2:28:14.680]  X1B you won't find it in the any of the books that they were published about
[2:28:14.680 --> 2:28:19.920]  submarines but he's managed to get the plans for it all sorts of stuff but it
[2:28:19.920 --> 2:28:25.800]  was only one ever built and it was it was in port in Danzig sitting there
[2:28:25.800 --> 2:28:30.720]  waiting for any any reason that Hitler or the high command of the German
[2:28:30.720 --> 2:28:34.720]  military might need to escape it was sitting there ready and the other thing
[2:28:34.720 --> 2:28:39.920]  with this U-boat it was enormous it also had a gigantic great hold so it
[2:28:39.920 --> 2:28:44.640]  wasn't a normal U-boat it wasn't a fighting U-boat it was able to transport
[2:28:44.640 --> 2:28:50.680]  vast amounts of goods and Ed had done his research and he but one of the
[2:28:50.680 --> 2:28:54.680]  reasons he was interested in this wreck which is now apparently still lying off
[2:28:54.680 --> 2:28:58.400]  Cape Cod in quite difficult diving waters unfortunately but it's lying
[2:28:58.400 --> 2:29:03.280]  there with a whole cargo load of gold on board because what Ed believed was
[2:29:03.280 --> 2:29:07.920]  that that was at towards the end of the war the Nazis started shipping their
[2:29:07.920 --> 2:29:11.360]  gold into the U-boat so that Hitler could escape with the gold across the
[2:29:11.360 --> 2:29:15.200]  Atlantic or wherever he wanted to go underwater we know a lot of it went to
[2:29:15.200 --> 2:29:20.040]  Central and South America that's on record that massive amounts of gold
[2:29:20.040 --> 2:29:26.160]  diamonds artwork and Nazis went to Argentina you name it and I don't think
[2:29:26.160 --> 2:29:29.400]  a submarine would be the best way of transporting gold around the world but I
[2:29:29.400 --> 2:29:33.480]  think it certainly makes it an intriguing prospect well see the Germans had
[2:29:33.480 --> 2:29:39.680]  the big the Germans had the big milk cows is what they called them large
[2:29:39.680 --> 2:29:44.680]  troop carrying cargo carrying subs and we know milk cows went to South America
[2:29:44.680 --> 2:29:49.680]  carrying all the goodies stay there Tony Gosling let's fast forward we get back

[2:35:00.760 --> 2:35:10.360]  future I fly a Starship let's go back to Tony Gosling billaberg.org okay
[2:35:10.360 --> 2:35:15.800]  Tony other interesting history though I mean it's now out in mainline news that
[2:35:15.800 --> 2:35:20.720]  it was Nazi money helping to found it kind of merging with the British and
[2:35:20.720 --> 2:35:25.800]  U.S. elites how was their agenda going according to Jim Tucker and Daniel
[2:35:25.800 --> 2:35:31.120]  Estolin and so many others that have sources inside it is not going well
[2:35:31.120 --> 2:35:35.560]  and that they realize that people are waking up to the new world order is is
[2:35:35.560 --> 2:35:40.560]  is that what you've got because I know you have a lot of contacts do constant
[2:35:40.560 --> 2:35:47.280]  research I know I think essentially what they're working to is to a two prong
[2:35:47.280 --> 2:35:51.200]  failure really what is a failed plan in the first place I mean a lot of these
[2:35:51.200 --> 2:35:55.040]  plans have drawn up you know many many many years ago and they just don't work
[2:35:55.040 --> 2:35:59.360]  in the modern world the other thing of course is it's a little bit like the
[2:35:59.360 --> 2:36:04.560]  Battle of Arnhem in the Second World War when the when the when the gliders
[2:36:04.560 --> 2:36:10.520]  came in to as part of a kind of large paratroop invasion the first thing the
[2:36:10.520 --> 2:36:15.280]  Germans got their hands on was the plans now what this is what we've got as
[2:36:15.280 --> 2:36:19.440]  well as we've got a lot of the plans of what they are they're intending to do I
[2:36:19.440 --> 2:36:23.040]  mean not not necessarily the individual operational details but the larger plan
[2:36:23.040 --> 2:36:26.960]  we've got it is coming up before we have the blueprints of the Death Star we
[2:36:26.960 --> 2:36:31.280]  have the blueprints of the Death Star and if we will just mount an X-wing attack
[2:36:31.280 --> 2:36:36.200]  we can beat them and we have done that and of course this is really ultimately
[2:36:36.200 --> 2:36:41.280]  is going to be and is already a massive battle for hearts of mine and of course
[2:36:41.280 --> 2:36:44.080]  if the hearts of minds are on the case before the battle starts then there's
[2:36:44.080 --> 2:36:47.920]  no chance of taking them away you know this is so I think this is a you know
[2:36:47.920 --> 2:36:52.920]  sort of meta looking at this whole thing from afar I think there's a yes of
[2:36:52.920 --> 2:36:55.200]  course the Bilderbergs have got some serious problems and they've got some
[2:36:55.200 --> 2:36:59.680]  even bigger problems after this year's conference because it was really the
[2:36:59.680 --> 2:37:06.720]  first time I've ever seen mainstream British newspaper or TV do a really
[2:37:06.720 --> 2:37:11.520]  good in-depth analysis and coverage and Charlie Skelton's pieces on the Guardian
[2:37:11.520 --> 2:37:14.680]  online I'm sure you've been following those Alex we've had him on mm-hmm yeah
[2:37:14.680 --> 2:37:19.680]  absolutely fantastic and this is the first and it's interesting that we see
[2:37:19.680 --> 2:37:24.840]  the Guardian as a left paper as the first one to really stick the knife in to
[2:37:24.840 --> 2:37:34.480]  Bilderberg now um let me go ahead yeah because I mean for me I mean I've come
[2:37:34.480 --> 2:37:40.920]  from us sort of reasonably left-wing trade union background and I've always
[2:37:40.920 --> 2:37:46.000]  thought that the biggest thorn in these people's sides is organized labor well
[2:37:46.000 --> 2:37:50.520]  organized and representative I mean for example on a program I do that here this
[2:37:50.520 --> 2:37:54.520]  evening in Bristol we had a guy from the communication workers union which
[2:37:54.520 --> 2:37:57.880]  represents the telecom workers and postal workers in the southwest of
[2:37:57.880 --> 2:38:02.640]  England and this one chap is representing 30,000 workers I think this is
[2:38:02.640 --> 2:38:06.120]  really what the Bilderbergs fit fear almost more than anything else is
[2:38:06.120 --> 2:38:12.000]  organized ordinary people organized ordinary workers etc against them and
[2:38:12.000 --> 2:38:16.280]  that's what Webster Tarpley says that's why they're so pleased to be flushing
[2:38:16.280 --> 2:38:20.480]  Chrysler and GM down the toilet right now because then only the state will be
[2:38:20.480 --> 2:38:24.240]  left to help people and it's controlled by the eugenicists at the Bilderberg
[2:38:24.240 --> 2:38:28.120]  groups they want us coming hat in hand begging to them to be literal share
[2:38:28.120 --> 2:38:33.560]  croppers in their global plantation in closing Tony so you concur with the
[2:38:33.560 --> 2:38:37.760]  other intel from the different perspectives we've gotten that Bilderberg
[2:38:37.760 --> 2:38:42.560]  is really starting to realize that you know one strength they have is they
[2:38:42.560 --> 2:38:46.000]  stick with the same plan and don't give up but that's also a weakness when
[2:38:46.000 --> 2:38:49.920]  you're carrying it out over 50 60 years because despite all their great wealth we
[2:38:49.920 --> 2:38:54.280]  have their plans the you know their plan wasn't set up in design for this
[2:38:54.280 --> 2:38:58.020]  hyper modern world the control grids they tried to build have kind of back
[2:38:58.020 --> 2:39:03.540]  fired on them answer that question and then finally take Charlie Skelton the
[2:39:03.540 --> 2:39:06.520]  Guardian reporter take the other reporters they arrested a whole bunch of
[2:39:06.520 --> 2:39:13.800]  people from Portuguese news and US news and and British news and if they were
[2:39:13.800 --> 2:39:18.120]  smart they just meet not act like it was a big deal but still you know have it be
[2:39:18.120 --> 2:39:22.680]  closed or instead they enjoy having people arrested they enjoy having the
[2:39:22.680 --> 2:39:26.440]  army out they enjoy shutting things down for two and a half miles in the middle
[2:39:26.440 --> 2:39:30.600]  of a giant tourist area and arresting tourists I mean isn't there arrogance
[2:39:30.600 --> 2:39:34.800]  their hubris going to be their downfall well I think it's about is actually a
[2:39:34.800 --> 2:39:40.080]  massive tactical error on their behalf on their side it because of their hotel
[2:39:40.080 --> 2:39:43.880]  is sealed off well away from anybody they are they are actually showing their
[2:39:43.880 --> 2:39:48.240]  hand by acting like that you know and and that this is one of the reasons I
[2:39:48.240 --> 2:39:50.920]  think what Charlie was so annoyed now I don't know if Charlie mentioned it but
[2:39:50.920 --> 2:39:56.400]  also the Times have covered it as well this year and it was it's also I mean
[2:39:56.400 --> 2:40:01.600]  to see the way these these newspapers operate in this kind of masquerade of
[2:40:01.600 --> 2:40:06.840]  competition knowing Murdoch's outlets you know Sky News the Times the Sun etc.
[2:40:06.840 --> 2:40:12.680]  is that they also they only act and they only do stuff when somebody else is
[2:40:12.680 --> 2:40:16.880]  doing it and this is what they're why they're making out that they are
[2:40:16.880 --> 2:40:20.360]  actually also interested in covering this stuff but you can be guaranteed if
[2:40:20.360 --> 2:40:23.080]  the Guardian hadn't been covering it would be not a word in the Times would
[2:40:23.080 --> 2:40:25.680]  have been about it but the other newspaper that covered it here in
[2:40:25.680 --> 2:40:29.720]  Britain was the Sunday Express which did a fantastic little piece calling them
[2:40:29.720 --> 2:40:33.960]  calling them the Bilderberg illuminati so this is for certainly in the
[2:40:33.960 --> 2:40:37.560]  English language newspapers this is the best year I've ever seen the Bilderberg
[2:40:37.560 --> 2:40:41.080]  coverage and Tony that leads me to my next point I'm gonna cover after you're
[2:40:41.080 --> 2:40:45.000]  gone but I want you to comment on this now so we have this weird paradox all
[2:40:45.000 --> 2:40:49.760]  these decades they've said we're crazy it doesn't exist there's no Anglo-American
[2:40:49.760 --> 2:40:56.080]  slash Germanic you know elite with this you know Israeli banking elite mixed in
[2:40:56.080 --> 2:41:02.920]  none of this exist it isn't real you're crazy if you talk about it and I know I
[2:41:02.920 --> 2:41:06.360]  just called you Charlie I know it's Tony I was thinking about Charlie and what
[2:41:06.360 --> 2:41:12.560]  happened to him let me start over we have Tony Gosling this paradox they've
[2:41:12.560 --> 2:41:16.160]  denied there's this global elite they've is they've denied there's this new world
[2:41:16.160 --> 2:41:21.160]  order and now so many of these documents have been declassified the globalists
[2:41:21.160 --> 2:41:24.400]  are out in the open saying yes the answer to the world crisis is a new world
[2:41:24.400 --> 2:41:29.960]  order you'll pay your taxes to private bankers I mean all of this is now being
[2:41:29.960 --> 2:41:34.800]  admitted but then still you have the mainline media even the same publications
[2:41:34.800 --> 2:41:39.360]  they'll admit there's a global new world order and define it just as we've
[2:41:39.360 --> 2:41:44.200]  defined it but then have a separate article in the New York Times saying it
[2:41:44.200 --> 2:41:51.080]  doesn't exist and we're insane and so it's really kind of like a train wreck to
[2:41:51.080 --> 2:41:56.320]  watch them not getting their propaganda lined up yeah I mean you see the point
[2:41:56.320 --> 2:41:59.520]  I'm making there they're denying something which they have to now admit
[2:41:59.520 --> 2:42:04.680]  well listen this is a massive catch-up is called for here right across the
[2:42:04.680 --> 2:42:08.720]  Western English speaking particularly media I mean we do that's what there is
[2:42:08.720 --> 2:42:13.560]  a kind of two-pronged problem and that one is that you do have censorship
[2:42:13.560 --> 2:42:17.560]  certainly places like Reuters as Charlie showed you know you type
[2:42:17.560 --> 2:42:21.640]  Bilderberg into Reuters and nothing comes up whatsoever you know so you've got
[2:42:21.640 --> 2:42:24.800]  some sort of censorship and I know for a fact I've seen Bilderberg articles on
[2:42:24.800 --> 2:42:28.080]  the Reuters system you know so they've obviously hidden these articles they
[2:42:28.080 --> 2:42:33.480]  were moving them up but there's also quite genuine ignorance I mean I when I
[2:42:33.480 --> 2:42:37.160]  speak to journalists about Bilderberg and I sort of know in the UK amongst other
[2:42:37.160 --> 2:42:41.200]  journals as a place to come to talk to Bilderberg about Bilderberg there's
[2:42:41.200 --> 2:42:44.840]  there's there's only two different reactions one is looking at me as if
[2:42:44.840 --> 2:42:49.720]  I'm slightly crazy and the other one or else you know or else good you know so
[2:42:49.720 --> 2:42:53.440]  there's a knowledge there so they're either or they're either for it or
[2:42:53.440 --> 2:42:56.600]  against it or whatever there's a very much of knowledge but most journalists
[2:42:56.600 --> 2:43:00.520]  actually haven't heard about this we're talking about ordinary journals who were
[2:43:00.520 --> 2:43:03.600]  working on other stories such as you know sports or that sort of thing they're
[2:43:03.600 --> 2:43:08.320]  just not an unused journalist or domestic stuff it's not in the the
[2:43:08.320 --> 2:43:11.760]  consciousness of journalism and this is what we're seeing is the sort of
[2:43:11.760 --> 2:43:16.080]  problems as it as as they're coming out of the closet because of course as you
[2:43:16.080 --> 2:43:19.080]  said rightly for years and years they've been denying it and now all of a
[2:43:19.080 --> 2:43:22.240]  sudden we're hearing all this oh we need a global solution we need a global
[2:43:22.240 --> 2:43:25.640]  solution we need a global solution so what's happening is I think what
[2:43:25.640 --> 2:43:30.120]  certainly the journalist I talked to is they're slowly realizing wow this is
[2:43:30.120 --> 2:43:34.480]  this is massive and it's been brewing under the surface for years and of
[2:43:34.480 --> 2:43:40.480]  course the trust that Bilderberg have constantly insisted on is now a sort of
[2:43:40.480 --> 2:43:45.360]  a trust which is rotting on the shelf because many editors who've trusted the
[2:43:45.360 --> 2:43:48.440]  Bilderberg line along the years which is always just a little private meeting
[2:43:48.440 --> 2:43:52.360]  and now thinking to themselves will hang on a minute we trusted you and you've
[2:43:52.360 --> 2:43:57.880]  completely screwed up from top to bottom well that was my next point is that
[2:43:57.880 --> 2:44:04.400]  this is a huge loss of trust happening as the mainstream media invested itself
[2:44:04.400 --> 2:44:09.440]  making fun of us and saying Limbaugh used to say the CFR didn't exist now it's
[2:44:09.440 --> 2:44:14.120]  all over TV pushing open-world government as the solution you know to all
[2:44:14.120 --> 2:44:20.360]  problems denying Bilderberg denying North American Union denying NAFTA super
[2:44:20.360 --> 2:44:24.760]  highways as they're being built the billboards are up you know because they've
[2:44:24.760 --> 2:44:30.680]  done this and because the media itself a lot of the time was actually just
[2:44:30.680 --> 2:44:33.920]  ignorant as you were saying and their editors were lying to them oh don't do a
[2:44:33.920 --> 2:44:37.840]  story on that that's just schizophrenic crazies you believe in space aliens that
[2:44:37.840 --> 2:44:43.800]  that whole line is now imploding and so the media is losing that much more
[2:44:43.800 --> 2:44:47.920]  credibility and then they're trying to play catch up and that only exposes the
[2:44:47.920 --> 2:44:52.120]  fact they covered this up that much more well this is the guardians line isn't
[2:44:52.120 --> 2:44:55.400]  it I think what they've done here is they've been mulling this over for years
[2:44:55.400 --> 2:44:58.360]  a lot of guardian people you know have been looking at this thinking hang on a
[2:44:58.360 --> 2:45:03.680]  minute this is a sort of fascist conspiracy against Britain and is this
[2:45:03.680 --> 2:45:06.400]  something we should take seriously and deal with and it seems to me at last
[2:45:06.400 --> 2:45:10.720]  they bit the bullet and grasp the nettle and they decided look we want we are
[2:45:10.720 --> 2:45:14.600]  going to actually fund and send a reporter there to get the gen I mean
[2:45:14.600 --> 2:45:17.360]  the Guardian is really shining at the moment I don't know if you've been
[2:45:17.360 --> 2:45:20.960]  following all this this massive MPs expenses scandal here in Britain have
[2:45:20.960 --> 2:45:24.800]  you yeah and they're also doing reports about the US government torturing
[2:45:24.800 --> 2:45:28.560]  children and they're doing stories about the government being corrupt and big
[2:45:28.560 --> 2:45:33.320]  brother and they're doing stories about stage terror attacks and I think it's a
[2:45:33.320 --> 2:45:37.000]  crisis of conscience there at the Guardian I think they also understand
[2:45:37.000 --> 2:45:41.800]  we're the future alternative media telling it like it is you know laying the
[2:45:41.800 --> 2:45:46.040]  cards down on the table I I think they want to survive into the future and
[2:45:46.040 --> 2:45:49.520]  people like the New York Times that are still basically saying none of this
[2:45:49.520 --> 2:45:54.440]  exist that's why they're going bankrupt right now Tony Gosling of
[2:45:54.440 --> 2:45:58.760]  Bilderberg.org I really appreciate you coming on the show and we'll talk to you
[2:45:58.760 --> 2:46:03.760]  one little last thing Alex because this week the Guardian has exposed that the the scandal
[2:46:03.760 --> 2:46:10.080]  here in the UK as this is this stolen a hard drive was stolen from the House of
[2:46:10.080 --> 2:46:14.080]  Commons with all these MPs expenses on it was actually stolen apparently by this
[2:46:14.080 --> 2:46:21.400]  ex SAS major who has links to obviously to the MI5 and MI6 who is called
[2:46:21.400 --> 2:46:26.280]  John Wick and it's actually been stolen by an ex SAS guy this is private
[2:46:26.280 --> 2:46:30.960]  security quite possibly working with them almost certainly working with MI6
[2:46:30.960 --> 2:46:35.400]  attempting to ferment a political crisis I think this is fascinating and it's
[2:46:35.400 --> 2:46:38.160]  nice to see that there's still some decent investigative journalism out there.
[2:46:38.160 --> 2:46:43.880]  Now let me stop you I have to be honest I get so busy that I had read about all
[2:46:43.880 --> 2:46:48.800]  the news headlines on Drudge about how they were going after members of
[2:46:48.800 --> 2:46:52.800]  Parliament for buying $200 dinners or getting a little bit of rent money or
[2:46:52.800 --> 2:46:57.920]  something and I said I believe this is a political distraction I said this first
[2:46:57.920 --> 2:47:01.800]  hour start of the show I said I believe this is a political distraction because
[2:47:01.800 --> 2:47:06.600]  they always love to use petty things to get control of Parliament the MI5 MI6
[2:47:06.600 --> 2:47:10.800]  has admittedly been spying illegally on Parliament you have the shadow illegitimate
[2:47:10.800 --> 2:47:15.720]  Queens government trying to control the Parliament to do these unpopular things
[2:47:15.720 --> 2:47:19.800]  you're saying I didn't know this you're saying they've caught intelligence people
[2:47:19.800 --> 2:47:26.920]  stealing it to use it as dirt on them so yeah I go ahead yeah so this guy is
[2:47:26.920 --> 2:47:30.720]  John is John Wick I mean this is private security companies obviously when
[2:47:30.720 --> 2:47:35.840]  people retire from special forces they set up often these like little kind of
[2:47:35.840 --> 2:47:41.200]  private investigator style agent agencies and yeah why is this guy John Wick
[2:47:41.200 --> 2:47:45.840]  not on the headlines instead of the MPs I mean clearly what's going on here is
[2:47:45.840 --> 2:47:50.520]  that the MPs are being dirtied up in rather a tacky fashion in order to
[2:47:50.520 --> 2:47:54.760]  distract attention from the billions and trillions that the bankers have run
[2:47:54.760 --> 2:47:58.880]  off with and of course MPs are our reps that they're the front line against the
[2:47:58.880 --> 2:48:02.640]  bankers and they're the ones that have been being dirtied up here and I think
[2:48:02.640 --> 2:48:06.320]  you know that the implication here is that the security services either MI5
[2:48:06.320 --> 2:48:10.520]  MI6 somebody like that is also working with this guy but you know what a
[2:48:10.520 --> 2:48:15.920]  private intelligence agency well they always they always use they always use
[2:48:15.920 --> 2:48:21.080]  visor consultancy to run the drills you know with the former head PR guy from
[2:48:21.080 --> 2:48:25.840]  Scotland Yard he runs the drills at the exact same time exact same places as the
[2:48:25.840 --> 2:48:29.800]  bus and the trains are bombed on the morning of 7 7 of the exact same time
[2:48:29.800 --> 2:48:33.920]  it's always private intelligence agencies quote you're gonna start a private
[2:48:33.920 --> 2:48:37.720]  group and then that's the public payoff they can then make because it's just a
[2:48:37.720 --> 2:48:41.080]  private group doing security and the government's giving you a paycheck but
[2:48:41.080 --> 2:48:45.600]  instead of making 60,000 pounds a year you're now making 150,000 pounds a year
[2:48:45.600 --> 2:48:49.600]  you know to carry these operations out so my instincts were right about that
[2:48:49.600 --> 2:48:55.200]  Tony I'm glad we talked to you from the UK along that line but absolutely
[2:48:55.200 --> 2:48:58.920]  anytime I see a report about a politician that's got a crooked toenail
[2:48:58.920 --> 2:49:02.920]  well meanwhile massive crimes are going on we know what it is a another
[2:49:02.920 --> 2:49:09.160]  parallel example of this is they took almost all the IRS agents off of
[2:49:09.160 --> 2:49:14.600]  billionaires 10 years ago and put them not just on middle class people make a
[2:49:14.600 --> 2:49:20.960]  hundred thousand dollars a year they put it on blue collar people who literally
[2:49:20.960 --> 2:49:25.640]  might just owe a few thousand dollars and so not only did they cut the amount of
[2:49:25.640 --> 2:49:30.000]  agents they put the investigators on the very poorest which of course would
[2:49:30.000 --> 2:49:33.440]  bring back the least amount of money and and cut all the white collar
[2:49:33.440 --> 2:49:37.280]  investigators across the government so I mean you I mean you really see it how
[2:49:37.280 --> 2:49:41.440]  they go after some poor auto mechanic who can't even you know pay his trailer
[2:49:41.440 --> 2:49:47.280]  bill but some billionaire can openly steal everything yeah I mean it's been a
[2:49:47.280 --> 2:49:49.720]  really good week actually for investigative journalism here and it's
[2:49:49.720 --> 2:49:52.960]  lovely to see because we've been living through a crisis of investigative
[2:49:52.960 --> 2:49:58.080]  journalism with all these newspapers TV stations radio stations etc cutting
[2:49:58.080 --> 2:50:02.560]  cutting cutting all their journalistic budgets another story that's come out
[2:50:02.560 --> 2:50:06.080]  this week and just you know stop me if you've already been over this Alex but
[2:50:06.080 --> 2:50:12.000]  it's a it's five Muslim community workers here in Britain have accused MI5
[2:50:12.000 --> 2:50:16.440]  of waging a campaign of blackmail and harassment in an attempt to recruit them
[2:50:16.440 --> 2:50:20.480]  as informants so you know basically what they're saying is MI5 are going to
[2:50:20.480 --> 2:50:23.960]  these Muslim community workers and saying either work for us or we're
[2:50:23.960 --> 2:50:27.160]  going to take say you're a terrorist we're going to put you on the list we're
[2:50:27.160 --> 2:50:30.840]  going to follow you and possibly arrest you too yeah we're going to see you
[2:50:30.840 --> 2:50:35.200]  want to obey I did see that and Bob Chapman covered it last hour but I mean
[2:50:35.200 --> 2:50:40.000]  we could talk for days about it it's so important all right Tony Gosling yeah I'm
[2:50:40.000 --> 2:50:43.400]  just making the point really that you know investigative journalism seems to
[2:50:43.400 --> 2:50:47.280]  be almost have kind of got a bit of a revival the last couple of weeks I've
[2:50:47.280 --> 2:50:50.320]  seen some fantastic stuff right out there I think we'll be seeing more in the
[2:50:50.320 --> 2:50:54.560]  future absolutely I mean the corruption is right out in the open if we all just
[2:50:54.560 --> 2:50:58.320]  stand up together we can overthrow this thing very quickly Tony or I could call
[2:50:58.320 --> 2:51:04.400]  you Charlie thanks for joining us due to recent events related to the H1N1

[2:54:20.240 --> 2:54:29.640]  other hit pieces on this film as well it premieres the 26 on IFC and it's on the
[2:54:29.640 --> 2:54:34.240]  IFC on demand they're telling me one of the most downloaded films ever on IFC

[2:54:40.160 --> 2:54:44.360]  are as tiresome as the New York Times I could talk for hours just about this
[2:54:44.360 --> 2:54:49.720]  article again not because it's about me the mindset of these people the attitude
[2:54:49.720 --> 2:54:55.120]  their their spirit few things are as tiresome as listening to people rant
[2:54:55.120 --> 2:54:59.240]  about their conspiracy theories really everybody knows it's super hot and
[2:54:59.240 --> 2:55:02.800]  that people find conspiracies intriguing whether they're real or not and
[2:55:02.800 --> 2:55:06.040]  the best-selling books are all about that and you know the New Angels and
[2:55:06.040 --> 2:55:11.160]  demons movie and all of that really it's people find few things more tiresome

[2:55:34.200 --> 2:55:39.000]  agenda the global elite movies about such things do well to involve James Bond
[2:55:39.000 --> 2:55:44.240]  and giant explosion so this isn't real it's James Bond of course you should

[2:57:28.440 --> 2:57:31.160]  without a shadow of doubt that they are trying to suppress his revelations
[2:57:31.160 --> 2:57:35.720]  yeah we had security walk-up and go people like to pull fire alarms but they
[2:57:35.720 --> 2:57:43.120]  go to jail when they do it and then they pull the fire alarm and I go outside the
[2:57:43.120 --> 2:57:46.760]  security head comes up when I'm outside with 200 people and says we're gonna F
[2:57:46.760 --> 2:57:51.200]  you up and their secret service running around all in video with headpieces and

[2:57:55.400 --> 2:58:00.440]  serious crime by the way and I get upset calling into a national talk show on

[2:58:06.640 --> 2:58:11.640]  land he thinks it's fake I saw mainstream news articles about this film New
[2:58:11.640 --> 2:58:15.920]  World Order that it's a documentary where they said other reviews that have
[2:58:15.920 --> 2:58:19.560]  been done said I made it up there was no Bilderberg group meeting happening in

[2:58:24.040 --> 2:58:27.160]  that's basically what this says but there were there were articles that we

[3:00:12.440 --> 3:00:27.280]  all right I'm finishing up with this attack review here by this Nathan Lee so
[3:00:27.280 --> 3:00:31.600]  he says basically what the other reviews have said I am at a random hotel
[3:00:31.600 --> 3:00:35.840]  completely insane and there were reviews that actually said this that I was
[3:00:35.840 --> 3:00:41.640]  seeing men following me seeing men in the bushes and at the premiere here in
[3:00:41.640 --> 3:00:44.880]  Austin I talked to some reporters outside and they said do you really think
[3:00:44.880 --> 3:00:48.600]  Bilderberg was real do you think those men were there you know with sunglasses
[3:00:48.600 --> 3:00:53.080]  and earpieces and I said you just saw them it's admitted it's real but see
[3:00:53.080 --> 3:00:57.600]  they're so invested that Bilderberg doesn't exist that when it's in the
[3:00:57.600 --> 3:01:02.480]  times of London and London Guardian and Associated Press it still doesn't exist
[3:01:02.480 --> 3:01:07.120]  and I'm crazy you know we're not being followed we're not being arrested I mean
[3:01:07.120 --> 3:01:11.200]  I've been arrested it's been a that was in every Canadian paper major paper in
[3:01:11.200 --> 3:01:16.840]  the country when I got arrested it was on CBC television and they still write
[3:01:16.840 --> 3:01:24.160]  articles saying I am a schizophrenic who believes I have been arrested I mean
[3:01:24.160 --> 3:01:33.040]  who's crazy here who is insane here because they're so invested in saying
[3:01:33.040 --> 3:01:36.040]  there's no new world order all these years that even as they announce it in
[3:01:36.040 --> 3:01:42.640]  Time Magazine and Newsweek and everywhere we still have to be the crazies on the
[3:01:42.640 --> 3:01:45.720]  somewhat mellower side Luke Radowski 21-year-old New Yorker spends all his
[3:01:45.720 --> 3:01:48.760]  free time distributing flyers and DVDs reporting to uncover the truth about 9
[3:01:48.760 --> 3:01:52.400]  11 Seth Jackson a relief worker in Louisiana does this part by heckling
[3:01:52.400 --> 3:01:56.800]  Bill Clinton and other dark overlords yeah how dare him go heckle a president
[3:01:56.800 --> 3:02:00.400]  you know to bring up real questions about firefighters and police not getting
[3:02:00.400 --> 3:02:07.000]  medical care oh it's a dark overlord he's he's crazy too it's so un-American and
[3:02:07.000 --> 3:02:11.720]  so crazy to go ask questions of your president that's like something Gandhi
[3:02:11.720 --> 3:02:16.120]  or Martin Luther King might do oh man the company this guy's in a retired
[3:02:16.120 --> 3:02:19.560]  police officer Jack McClann meanwhile has retreated to the safety of a
[3:02:19.560 --> 3:02:24.320]  separatist militia group it's a it's a Christian community in the beautiful
[3:02:24.320 --> 3:02:31.240]  Rocky Mountains with their little dogs this is the distorted mind where they
[3:02:31.240 --> 3:02:36.080]  see they're in their ivory tower insane asylums looking out at us normal people
[3:02:36.080 --> 3:02:40.040]  they get angry and have red blood and sweat and you know care about freedom and
[3:02:40.040 --> 3:02:46.640]  we are strange to them but I mean I guess if you go to a loony farm normal
[3:02:46.640 --> 3:02:52.160]  people do look crazy you know we're the type of people at least were shadows of
[3:02:52.160 --> 3:02:55.280]  them that founded this nation we're red-blooded we're aggressive we're
[3:02:55.280 --> 3:03:02.040]  angry we're gonna kick your butt so I hope you understand that I'm just glad
[3:03:02.040 --> 3:03:08.400]  I'm not you know some some effeminate chicken-necked America hating person
[3:03:08.400 --> 3:03:13.000]  who who just goes around picking and knitting and other people and attacking
[3:03:13.000 --> 3:03:16.440]  people that are trying to save the country from the globalist and in his
[3:03:16.440 --> 3:03:20.440]  and look you will lose in history that the New York Times is gonna basically be
[3:03:20.440 --> 3:03:24.600]  sold and be a shadow of itself go bankrupt that's already happening you
[3:03:24.600 --> 3:03:28.520]  guys you know you will not survive the New World Order whether it succeeds or
[3:03:28.520 --> 3:03:32.520]  fails you people aren't gonna be part of the future you understand you're all
[3:03:32.520 --> 3:03:37.600]  discredited you're a joke those of us telling the truth that have had the
[3:03:37.600 --> 3:03:45.800]  courage to stand up in the face of ridicule we're gonna win the day there's
[3:03:45.800 --> 3:03:49.040]  a movie to be made about the psychology of such men their personal lives and
[3:03:49.040 --> 3:03:55.360]  private obsessions New World Order merely gawks at them opens Friday in
[3:03:55.360 --> 3:03:59.160]  Manhattan directed by Luke Meyer Andrew Neil directors of photography and and
[3:03:59.160 --> 3:04:05.160]  you know it is and it's can also run IFC it is true that look I'm not stupid and
[3:04:05.160 --> 3:04:09.800]  now that it's about to come out and it's and it's you know I'll just come out
[3:04:09.800 --> 3:04:16.920]  and tell what I think I don't think Andrew and these guys are bad people but the
[3:04:16.920 --> 3:04:20.960]  kind of liberal intellectual set always is above everyone so that's their
[3:04:20.960 --> 3:04:27.160]  internal appetite is to pick subjects like with dark on the last film they
[3:04:27.160 --> 3:04:31.640]  made this is kind of dark on to a weird niche of subculture as they see it we'll
[3:04:31.640 --> 3:04:35.320]  see we're not that we're trying to survive it's a latch dish five year we're
[3:04:35.320 --> 3:04:40.840]  not just a subculture and then they kind of analyze it show our faults and our
[3:04:40.840 --> 3:04:45.760]  positive points but it's still done from a position of on high and so the film
[3:04:45.760 --> 3:04:50.200]  will be seen by those that hate us as an after as a confirmation of what they
[3:04:50.200 --> 3:04:53.280]  believe and then by people that love freedom they see it and kind of like
[3:04:53.280 --> 3:04:58.320]  it because they get it and understand our message but regardless it only brings
[3:04:58.320 --> 3:05:03.680]  us more listeners we win hello friends this is Alex Jones I've told you for a

[3:07:40.600 --> 3:07:59.600]  this is brought to you by hempusa.org supplier of fine hemp products sponsoring the Genesis communications radio network the leader in alternative talk radio radio radio
[3:07:59.600 --> 3:08:16.600]  thanks Hollywood is about to unleash another blockbuster angels and demons from the same guy who brought you the da Vinci code the story exposes a secret society called the Illuminati but the shadowy group has a very real secret that stretches all the way to Arizona
[3:08:16.600 --> 3:08:41.600]  investigative reporter Tammy Leitner brings us the story of money murder and mystery right here in the valley we are under attack from an old enemy the race to save the Vatican and all of humanity from the clutches of the Illuminati is great fiction on the big screen but the powerful organization is no myth
[3:08:41.600 --> 3:09:04.600]  the Illuminati do exist our modern Illuminati mystery brings us to the most unlikely of places sun city the quintessential retirement community and among the retirees a man with a secret Paul Marsinkus was once a papal guard and archbishop and president of the Vatican bank
[3:09:04.600 --> 3:09:22.600]  oh no he knew quite a bit and what Marsinkus knew is at the center of a conspiracy theory that has endured for decades attorney Jonathan Levy has been locked in a legal battle with the Vatican bank for years he says Marsinkus is the central figure in the mysterious death of this man
[3:09:22.600 --> 3:09:45.600]  Roberto Calvi Calvi like Marsinkus was an Italian banker they very well worthy Illuminati at least in Italy powerful people behind the scenes operating in secrecy in 1982 Calvi was found hanged from the black fryer's bridge in London it was staged to look like a suicide Calvi was connected to the disappearance of
[3:09:45.600 --> 3:10:00.600]  and we have Dr Jonathan Levy with us international law adjunct faculty at Norwich University in the field of terrorism
[3:10:00.600 --> 3:10:16.600]  Dr Levy is best known for his role as counsel for plaintiffs in the lawsuit versus the Vatican bank we'll talk to him in a moment
[3:10:30.600 --> 3:10:59.600]  the Vatican bank claims dot com is the website under Jonathan Levy
[3:10:59.600 --> 3:11:16.600]  joins us he's obtained declassified documents and hundreds of previously unknown documents regarding a Vatican spy master so people want to go inside the Vatican spy system their international espionage systems what they're up to
[3:11:16.600 --> 3:11:30.600]  well we look long and hard to find actually a real accredited expert on this and not one of the myriads of quacks and weirdos out there but I think this guy's got some pretty good background in research Dr Jonathan Levy professor at Norwich University
[3:11:30.600 --> 3:11:44.600]  sir thank you for joining us tell us as you know in a three minute newscast we only played part of it it you know it's not very clear exactly what's going on boil it down for us and why are you nine ten years later still in a lawsuit with the Vatican
[3:11:44.600 --> 3:11:54.600]  well yeah thanks for that uh... introduction alex but uh... yeah we've been in federal court for ten years now we filed the lawsuit in nineteen ninety nine
[3:11:54.600 --> 3:12:10.600]  seeking return of Nazi gold from the Vatican bank and the Vatican has tried every legal trick in the book to get that case out of there and including going to uh... the u.s. ambassador to the Vatican going to Condoleezza Rice and we've hung in there and and we're still continuing
[3:12:10.600 --> 3:12:22.600]  okay well I mean give us a boil down of the the the Vatican the Nazis what happened with the gold how this ties into the Illuminati how this ties into uh... Vatican intelligence operatives will that be the Jesuits
[3:12:22.600 --> 3:12:40.600]  right Jesuits, Franciscans, in fact we're suing the Franciscan order as well but it started at the beginning as World War two was wrapping up a group from former Yugoslavia called the Ustasha which ran the Nazi puppet government in Croatia
[3:12:40.600 --> 3:12:59.600]  started evacuating all the gold and loot they had gotten from concentration camps whose victims mainly were Serbs Orthodox Christians and they were welcomed at the Vatican a ten truck convoy of loot was driven into St. Peter's Square
[3:12:59.600 --> 3:13:18.600]  and deposited at the Vatican bank in 1946 U.S. intelligence knew about it but none of this came out until nineteen ninety seven or nineteen ninety eight when the U.S. State Department released information and we followed it up after that point
[3:13:18.600 --> 3:13:32.600]  did the research, got the declassified documents, sued the CIA to get the declassified documents and filed a lawsuit in federal court for return of the gold or an accounting of what happened to it
[3:13:32.600 --> 3:13:48.600]  well obviously the Nazis had robbed much of Russia and Western Europe, the Mediterranean and just unbelievable art, huge salt mines full of gold, diamonds, Rembrandts and a lot of it disappeared to the U.S. the Russians but also as you were reporting the Vatican
[3:13:48.600 --> 3:14:05.600]  continue with your lawsuit, the documents you got, where this money went, where these Nazis went or these Nazi puppets went and how this ties into the Vatican bank and that news piece we just played part of dealing with the Illuminati
[3:14:05.600 --> 3:14:21.600]  sure to cut to the chase on the Illuminati how do you move literally tens of millions or hundreds of millions of dollars worth of gold after the end of the Second World War when you know it's contraband, Italy's occupied by the U.S. military
[3:14:21.600 --> 3:14:39.600]  well you do it in connection with some very powerful folks and people in the CIA, Jim Angleton who went on to be head of CIA counterintelligence was involved, British intelligence, the MI6 was involved with this plot
[3:14:39.600 --> 3:14:55.600]  and it leads up into current banking at the Vatican bank going on into the Calvi murder and up into the 1990s with the breakup of Yugoslavia, who financed all that, who bought the arms for the Croatians, where did the money come from
[3:14:55.600 --> 3:15:09.600]  the Croatians had actually served the Nazis for those who don't know and the Serbs, I'm not playing sides, they're just facts, were asking Madeleine Albright whose family they saved including her, why are you doing this to us and they just laughed at them
[3:15:09.600 --> 3:15:19.600]  but I'm glad you know the history, that's why researching your stuff and it's so accurate for my own research, it's good to find somebody out there who knows more than I do, I don't know that much, but who was actually accurate
[3:15:19.600 --> 3:15:34.600]  now understanding all of this, I want to go through some of the history of that and bring it up to today, but how much loot does the Vatican have from their exploits worldwide and is it true that they hoard a lot of it in Vatican City itself?
[3:15:34.600 --> 3:15:52.600]  that's a great question and we found out the answer to that, in suing the Vatican bank we forced them to give up information about how they operate, now what they'll tell you is that they aren't really a bank, well it's probably true they're more like a fencing operation, masquerading as a bank
[3:15:52.600 --> 3:16:12.600]  their charter says that they can take all property movable and immovable, well that's just about everything you can think of, any sort of valuable, painting, gold brick, antiquities, whatever you want to bring in there, the key to getting something into the Vatican bank is the magic words church property
[3:16:12.600 --> 3:16:34.600]  if you can turn your loot, your stolen property into church property, it goes in the front door at the Vatican bank and out the back door and the Nazis aren't the only ones that have done it, the mafia has used the Vatican bank for years and a fellow who I've been in contact, Marty Frankel is sitting in a federal prison in Texas
[3:16:34.600 --> 3:16:44.600]  for his part and the disappearance between somewhere of 50 million and 250 million dollars of insurance money, all went into the Vatican bank
[3:16:44.600 --> 3:17:10.600]  I mean really doesn't the Vatican operate kind of like one of these, the Cayman Islands or the Bahamas or the way the Swiss do, the Swiss or the armors for the Vatican historically are their bankers, the city of London itself, I mean all of these little special incorporations all have histories of this don't they, but I don't think anybody has a history quite as deep and serious as the Vatican
[3:17:10.600 --> 3:17:32.600]  they're pretty serious and the reason is of course they have diplomatic immunity, Archbishop Marcinkus that that little piece from Phoenix was about, lived in Sun City, he was a criminal, he was wanted by the Italian authorities, but no one could touch the man because he had diplomatic immunity conferred upon him by the smallest country in the world, the Holy See
[3:17:32.600 --> 3:17:36.600]  so that goes back to the old thing of sanctuary
[3:17:36.600 --> 3:17:56.600]  well sanctuary but it also goes to sovereignty, remember, the Pope wears three hats, he's head of the church, he's the Prince of Vatican City and he's head of a sovereign entity called the Holy See which has diplomatic relations with well over 150 countries and therefore diplomatic immunity
[3:17:56.600 --> 3:18:09.600]  did you see how the Vatican refuses to pay Italy their power bills I mean I'm not hearing a Vatican bashing fascist just needs to be looked at is there any idea how great the wealth of the Vatican is or is that a secret
[3:18:09.600 --> 3:18:17.600]  well it's not a secret the Vatican will come out with some phony figures every year saying they're worth about 24 million dollars
[3:18:17.600 --> 3:18:34.600]  the wealth is unbelievable and it's what we've discovered in just suing the Franciscan order was that at one address in California at one little address at one monastery in California 24 different corporations were registered
[3:18:34.600 --> 3:18:46.600]  now you add that up from place to place and there are literally tens of thousands of entities masquerading as independent entities that are all really the Catholic church
[3:18:46.600 --> 3:19:02.600]  amazing Mr. Levy I want to come back in the next segment and get into the Vatican banker getting hung and you know you call it the Illuminati I mean that's just another name for secret society or mafia I mean what is Illuminati to you
[3:19:02.600 --> 3:19:13.600]  Illuminati is a secret society but it's not just a secret society it's a secret society that uses spiritual warfare and not just economic but spiritual warfare as well
[3:19:13.600 --> 3:19:18.600]  you mean they believe that or they use the religion to control people what are you saying
[3:19:18.600 --> 3:19:31.600]  well I think there is such a thing as good and evil and as others have said we look at warfare and you have political warfare, economic warfare and there's another dimension which is spiritual warfare
[3:19:31.600 --> 3:19:41.600]  and some things are done that are just so evil and contrary to humanity that you'd have to say it goes beyond mere economics and politics
[3:19:41.600 --> 3:19:55.600]  alright well we're getting a window into somebody who's been suing the Vatican for ten years since 1999 he is Dr. Jonathan Levy professor at Norwich University in the field of terrorism of all things
[3:19:55.600 --> 3:20:00.600]  he's been one of the most successful people ever in suing them we'll come back and find out more
[3:20:00.600 --> 3:20:07.600]  in the new world orders war against humanity Barack Obama is the tip of the spear
[3:20:07.600 --> 3:20:13.600]  we've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see
[3:20:13.600 --> 3:20:20.600]  the Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people
[3:20:20.600 --> 3:20:24.600]  well Obama's already fudging he's fudged since day one in this election
[3:20:24.600 --> 3:20:36.600]  if you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs that's fascism
[3:20:36.600 --> 3:20:41.600]  it's not about left to right it's about a one-world government
[3:20:41.600 --> 3:20:48.600]  this film documents who Obama works for the lies he is told and his real agenda

[3:21:00.600 --> 3:21:06.600]  hello Ted Anderson listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending
[3:21:06.600 --> 3:21:14.600]  therefore with catastrophic events it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts
[3:21:14.600 --> 3:21:20.600]  a fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal
[3:21:20.600 --> 3:21:27.600]  deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to ensure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy
[3:21:27.600 --> 3:21:33.600]  a current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors
[3:21:33.600 --> 3:21:40.600]  however an increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation in order to achieve strength and stability
[3:21:40.600 --> 3:21:46.600]  I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver
[3:21:46.600 --> 3:21:52.600]  while paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6000 years

[3:24:21.600 --> 3:24:34.600]  this is how things are done inside the new world order system going back to our guest with the website VaticanBankClaims.com
[3:24:34.600 --> 3:24:41.600]  and big news blitz coming up in your calls VaticanBankClaims.com okay I mean there's so much we got to have you back up in the future
[3:24:41.600 --> 3:24:49.600]  spend the whole hour with us sir and take phone calls but in the limited time today I mean it's there's no doubt that that
[3:24:49.600 --> 3:24:56.600]  Vatican admits a lot of the Nazi loot went to them and then you were getting into Serbia and the Croats who for those that don't know
[3:24:56.600 --> 3:25:04.600]  they were the puppets for the Nazis and all the stuff there and then who financed you know the takeover of Serbia you're saying that's the Vatican
[3:25:04.600 --> 3:25:15.600]  break that down well absolutely there's no question that Croatia received its funding from the Vatican or Vatican financiers in 1990-1991
[3:25:15.600 --> 3:25:27.600]  and that's where we think a lot of the Nazi loot went to eventually to break up Yugoslavia which was after all the goal of the Germans of the
[3:25:27.600 --> 3:25:40.600]  Vatican and of the Croatians and why was that their goal well think about it you know history Alex who killed the Austrian Archduke in 1914
[3:25:40.600 --> 3:25:48.600]  and caused the fall of all the empires well that was the black hand tied in with the Vatican and British intelligence is what I read
[3:25:48.600 --> 3:25:56.600]  yes but it was a they blame the Serbs for that yes yeah and of course that that's why the Serbs have always been on the chopping block
[3:25:56.600 --> 3:26:05.600]  there in the Balkans that's the excuse at least and of course the excuse again for breaking up Yugoslavia turning it into a bunch of
[3:26:05.600 --> 3:26:13.600]  many states but what we aim to see where did this money go to and what was it used for and and and the correct you there
[3:26:13.600 --> 3:26:21.600]  no the Vatican does not admit that it ever took any Nazi gold they'll do everything possible but to admit to any kind of wrongdoing
[3:26:21.600 --> 3:26:26.600]  well they even say rat singer wasn't a Hitler youth though so it's kind of getting ridiculous
[3:26:26.600 --> 3:26:36.600]  well absolutely I mean we we know we we have a eyewitness thank god a the a the a u.s. intelligence agent the name bill gallon who was
[3:26:36.600 --> 3:26:46.600]  there in Rome 1946 1947 as a young counterintelligence special agent for the u.s. army and he investigated this and he gave
[3:26:46.600 --> 3:26:54.600]  four days worth of testimony and a deposition verifying everything that I'm telling you today verifying that a ten truck convoy
[3:26:54.600 --> 3:27:03.600]  went into first to a monastery in Rome where they changed out from British license plates to Vatican ones and drove right in there to
[3:27:03.600 --> 3:27:10.600]  St. Peter's Square claiming they had the church property on it and he interviewed and debriefed the people involved in that operation
[3:27:10.600 --> 3:27:18.600]  okay tell us about there's so many things to discuss the famous case of the Vatican banker dying and and and how that ties into things
[3:27:18.600 --> 3:27:28.600]  right well the Vatican bank also known as the Institute for Religious Works has been involved in one scandal after another
[3:27:28.600 --> 3:27:38.600]  and many scandals that we aren't even aware about because they got away with it the Calvi case was high finance and it's
[3:27:38.600 --> 3:27:48.600]  worse involved the largest bank in Italy Banco Ambrosiano involved operations in the Bahamas and ultimately in North America some people claim
[3:27:48.600 --> 3:27:58.600]  it triggered the savings and loan crisis in the 1980s and it was a purposeful destabilization of Italy's largest bank by a group called
[3:27:58.600 --> 3:28:08.600]  the P2 who I think are we're Illuminati and one of their many guys is they the idea being to take over Italy and it caused
[3:28:08.600 --> 3:28:19.600]  disruptions worldwide the people involved in Dona and Calvi both died mysteriously Marsinkus went into hiding at Sun City Arizona
[3:28:19.600 --> 3:28:27.600]  and the epicenter of the whole thing was the Vatican so it's sort of like the Dan Brown book
[3:28:27.600 --> 3:28:36.600]  Do you think that the Vatican is at the heart of the European Union because I'm trying to learn and fair it this out I know Blair has
[3:28:36.600 --> 3:28:48.600]  converted so that he can be head of the EU that's admitted I know that the European Union the they say that is Roman Catholic and
[3:28:48.600 --> 3:28:57.600]  that they wanted to you know be the new quote center of a global Europe according to the British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and
[3:28:57.600 --> 3:29:03.600]  that the Treaty of Rome set up the European Union and now US Army documents have been declassified you probably know about this that
[3:29:03.600 --> 3:29:10.600]  the Nazis knew they were going to lose in 44 so they put their money into dummy corporations and said we will rise again as a European
[3:29:10.600 --> 3:29:17.600]  Union are you familiar with that well yeah I'm familiar with that theory and there is a lot of things to support that first of all
[3:29:17.600 --> 3:29:24.600]  some of the symbolism even even the flag of the European Union and of the Council of Europe is taken from the altar at the
[3:29:24.600 --> 3:29:36.600]  Cathedral of Strasbourg is those stars that circular stars and the there was a pre-runner a forerunner to the European Union called
[3:29:36.600 --> 3:29:45.600]  the trying to think pan Europa Union and had it was the same flag except with a cross in the middle of it stay there let's do five more

[3:33:09.600 --> 3:33:15.600]  they got him now so he's coming up about three minutes he was at Bilderberg he always learns more in hindsight than even
[3:33:15.600 --> 3:33:21.600]  learns while he's there so we'll get an update from him and then go to Omid in Sweden and Texas and Texas lands in
[3:33:21.600 --> 3:33:26.600]  Connecticut Steven and Texas Jonathan and Connecticut I'll at least get to those get a few other key news articles
[3:33:26.600 --> 3:33:37.600]  finishing up with Dr. Jonathan Levy his lawsuit against the Vatican for their activities you know I've studied the new
[3:33:37.600 --> 3:33:45.600]  power structure and it just looks like every major nation in the west the east they're all just run by strong men special
[3:33:45.600 --> 3:33:51.600]  interest and they all just meet together and you know we're setting up this you know a world system with less and less
[3:33:51.600 --> 3:33:57.600]  freedom from your research I mean are you saying you think the Vatican is the most powerful force in the world or are you
[3:33:57.600 --> 3:34:03.600]  just saying it's run by a mafia or other factions in the Vatican I mean because you're quite a Vatican expert and
[3:34:03.600 --> 3:34:09.600]  there's and you're a professor you know the study is the top of things I mean what's your bottom line view on that
[3:34:09.600 --> 3:34:15.600]  bottom line they ought to drag the books you know the account books out of the Vatican and audit them that that's what
[3:34:15.600 --> 3:34:22.600]  they ought to do and if you did that you'd get to a you know the bottom of a lot of mysteries you know including
[3:34:22.600 --> 3:34:29.600]  maybe even what happened to Bernie made off billions who knows what's in there
[3:34:29.600 --> 3:34:37.600]  yeah good old Bernie made off just another case of that so where's your suit going and I mean it's getting a lot of
[3:34:37.600 --> 3:34:43.600]  media attention it's been going on 10 years have they exhausted all their legal tricks or are you going to prevail
[3:34:43.600 --> 3:34:48.600]  or what's happening well what we hope we're going to prevail we're on the sixth amended complaint which
[3:34:48.600 --> 3:34:56.600]  means we've had to amend the lawsuit six times of course the Vatican has a bottomless legal resources right now the
[3:34:56.600 --> 3:35:03.600]  case against the Vatican Bank itself is up again in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals this time on the issue of
[3:35:03.600 --> 3:35:09.600]  immunity can you see can you even sue the Vatican Bank in the United States and then the other part of the lawsuit
[3:35:09.600 --> 3:35:16.600]  is proceeding slowly but proceeding and that's against the Franciscan order who were the actual foot soldiers of
[3:35:16.600 --> 3:35:24.600]  the church involved in laundering this concentration camp money amazing okay well dr. Jonathan Levy thank you so much
[3:35:24.600 --> 3:35:30.600]  for spending time with us thank you so much you better take care now we're trying to give you all perspectives
[3:35:30.600 --> 3:35:36.600]  here and and before we go to Jim Tucker and I want to ask Jim Tucker this question I've studied it the
[3:35:36.600 --> 3:35:41.600]  Vatican's its own city it's above the law the Federal Reserve's private it tells us on the news it's above
[3:35:41.600 --> 3:35:46.600]  any law we're now told the bankers are above the law with the banker bailout the District of Columbia
[3:35:46.600 --> 3:35:52.600]  says they have immunity or an above the law or an incorporation there's all these you know the Cayman
[3:35:52.600 --> 3:35:58.600]  are above the law it's just basically mafia's takeover groups are set up organizations then declare
[3:35:58.600 --> 3:36:04.600]  they're above the law and now it's a bunch of these groups teaming up they form the New World Order so they're
[3:36:04.600 --> 3:36:11.600]  all guilty Israel you know is a private you know basic corporation you know and there's different people
[3:36:11.600 --> 3:36:18.600]  that live there but the point is the elites are using it as a as a command base I mean it's the same story
[3:36:18.600 --> 3:36:24.600]  over and over again let's go to Jim Tucker Jim good to have you on with us always a pleasure hey you just
[3:36:24.600 --> 3:36:28.600]  heard with the point I was making what's your take on what's at the top of the New World Order
[3:36:28.600 --> 3:36:34.600]  because I mean I see it as a bunch of pyramids that that kind of nest inside each other like Russian dolls
[3:36:34.600 --> 3:36:40.600]  or they get all nexus is in the head of the CFR is also one of the heads of the Bilderberg group that's
[3:36:40.600 --> 3:36:45.600]  heads of the Bilderberg group of the heads of the Club of Rome and and it's just all interconnected
[3:36:45.600 --> 3:36:51.600]  yes it is Bilderberg collateral commission and of course as we've said so many times the Council of
[3:36:51.600 --> 3:36:59.600]  Foreign Relations has a clique at the top at 3,000 to 4,000 members the clique at the top will handle
[3:36:59.600 --> 3:37:04.600]  the Bilderberg propaganda and what we talked about today will become forthcoming in the month ahead is
[3:37:04.600 --> 3:37:14.600]  as white papers issued by the CFR advocating those very points that's right every time you have your
[3:37:14.600 --> 3:37:19.600]  inside sources you put out what they said and then we see the white papers word for word what Tucker
[3:37:19.600 --> 3:37:24.600]  says come out no sorts like Tucker out there okay in hindsight what was this year's Bilderberg like
[3:37:24.600 --> 3:37:30.600]  what key intel did you get that you didn't relate to us last week where is the world going are things
[3:37:30.600 --> 3:37:36.600]  going well for Bilderberg Jim Tucker things are not going well for Bilderberg the patriotic Americans
[3:37:36.600 --> 3:37:44.600]  and the Patriotic Nationalists from Europe are blocking Bilderberg very effectively but that does
[3:37:44.600 --> 3:37:50.600]  does not mean we can let our guard up because they're still bent on a world government they're still
[3:37:50.600 --> 3:37:57.600]  working as grim faces they are toward a world government and some of the plans they set forth now
[3:37:57.600 --> 3:38:04.600]  would eliminate large amounts of our national sovereignty of our country in that of other countries
[3:38:04.600 --> 3:38:15.600]  around North America Europe and even the entire world now this year as we discussed before big on
[3:38:15.600 --> 3:38:25.600]  the agenda was how to exploit the current economic meltdown and the alleged swine flu at the pandemic
[3:38:25.600 --> 3:38:36.600]  in order to create a global Department of Treasury a global Department of Health the Federal Reserve
[3:38:36.600 --> 3:38:45.600]  would evolve into the UN's global Department of Treasury the World Health Organization would
[3:38:45.600 --> 3:38:51.600]  evolve into the United Nations Department of Health obviously that would surrender great
[3:38:51.600 --> 3:38:59.600]  cops of sovereignty so Carl built the long-time luminary Bilderberg luminary also luminary on
[3:38:59.600 --> 3:39:06.600]  the tri-lateral Commission and former Prime Minister Sweden now Minister for Foreign Affairs he
[3:39:06.600 --> 3:39:16.600]  delivered a major speech and arguing exactly far that he said the world economic meltdown is
[3:39:16.600 --> 3:39:26.600]  close once a generation crisis while global warming is a what's a millennium challenge
[3:39:26.600 --> 3:39:34.600]  we are at a crucial time he told the bill said the order of magnitude of the world crisis are
[3:39:34.600 --> 3:39:39.600]  more challenging than we are used to the world economic recession has already reversed strong
[3:39:39.600 --> 3:39:44.600]  annual growth rates in many developing up nations and in some parts of Europe has potential to
[3:39:44.600 --> 3:39:50.600]  bring down governments when we hit bottom we can be sure when we will bounce back up says
[3:39:50.600 --> 3:39:57.600]  Bilderberg says I mean don't tell Bilderberg this is an economic crisis unlike anything we have dealt
[3:39:57.600 --> 3:40:05.600]  with in living memory so Jim Tucker you're giving us actual transcript from your sources inside
[3:40:05.600 --> 3:40:14.600]  no I'm giving you is close to me sources inside yeah no I understand so but you're giving us
[3:40:14.600 --> 3:40:24.600]  a type of transcript is my handwritten notes okay it's bullet points you know there's 179 now
[3:40:24.600 --> 3:40:30.600]  to audit the private Fed is that worrying them I mean you you said that they're worried about
[3:40:30.600 --> 3:40:37.600]  the anti Lisbon treaty keep calling it Lisbon I know that's a capital of Portugal Lisbon I know
[3:40:37.600 --> 3:40:44.600]  they're upset about the Lisbon treaty yes they're trying to pressure the Irish into reversing
[3:40:44.600 --> 3:40:54.600]  itself in a referendum which is required for the Lisbon treaty to take place to take effect
[3:40:54.600 --> 3:41:02.600]  and somehow it straightens the European Parliament the European Union's Parliament I don't see
[3:41:02.600 --> 3:41:07.600]  I could get stronger because we can already pass laws and impose them on the individual member
[3:41:07.600 --> 3:41:15.600]  nations they'd also have more of a currency to the presence is rotating every few minutes to
[3:41:15.600 --> 3:41:25.600]  another and more powerful cabinet type of operation all that is to enhance of course the European
[3:41:25.600 --> 3:41:35.600]  Union which is already there is a major section of the world government like the American Union
[3:41:35.600 --> 3:41:41.600]  is to bob into under their plans but as I said their plans have been set back they thought in
[3:41:41.600 --> 3:41:46.600]  the 90s they were very confident that by the year 2000 there would be an American Union would
[3:41:46.600 --> 3:41:53.600]  all be happy to surrender sovereignty to to the American Union which would involve the
[3:41:53.600 --> 3:42:00.600]  entire Western Hemisphere to the American Union legislative bodies that could impose laws
[3:42:00.600 --> 3:42:06.600]  and have a European American Union court that could be superior to the Supreme Court
[3:42:06.600 --> 3:42:11.600]  sure Jim in the time we've got with you some other questions you said this is the most security
[3:42:11.600 --> 3:42:17.600]  ever saw did that backfire on them they arrested and detained American reporters from American
[3:42:17.600 --> 3:42:23.600]  Free Press London Guardian reporter other reporters and just tourists two miles away two and
[3:42:23.600 --> 3:42:28.600]  a half miles away arresting people and that all these years the media is tonight it existed
[3:42:28.600 --> 3:42:35.600]  now it was in the AP it's in Politico it's in even some major US papers it was in British
[3:42:35.600 --> 3:42:41.600]  papers I mean the mere fact that they keep trying to be so secretive it looks like all
[3:42:41.600 --> 3:42:46.600]  those years of denial is now backfiring on them and that their heavy hand is backfiring
[3:42:46.600 --> 3:42:52.600]  yes it is it's a breakthrough that I haven't seen the AP story yet but they have a substantial
[3:42:52.600 --> 3:42:58.600]  story on the Bilderberg yeah it was a whitewash it had the headline in fact pull it up guys
[3:42:58.600 --> 3:43:04.600]  for folks at prisonplanet.tv watching please and for listeners it was a nationalist protest
[3:43:04.600 --> 3:43:12.600]  Bilderberg or nationalist protest elite meeting something like that in fact just put Bilderberg
[3:43:12.600 --> 3:43:18.600]  in and then put nationalist protest Greek nationalist protest the word Bilderberg will bring it up
[3:43:18.600 --> 3:43:23.600]  here it is Greek nationalist protest Bilderberg club meeting okay I was right the first time
[3:43:23.600 --> 3:43:30.600]  with the memory and it's AP police heavily guarded luxury resort in Greece on Saturday
[3:43:30.600 --> 3:43:34.600]  where a secretive annual rendezvous of top politicians business leaders reportedly took
[3:43:34.600 --> 3:43:40.600]  place that's a first I think for AP Jim it is called AP has been under tremendous pressure
[3:43:40.600 --> 3:43:48.600]  all these years to never use word Bilderberg from the Washington Post LA Times and the
[3:43:48.600 --> 3:43:54.600]  New York Times all through those major newspapers are owned by Bilderberg that's still a softly
[3:43:54.600 --> 3:44:00.100]  home because we've all attended these meetings Washington Post publishers attend every meeting
[3:44:00.100 --> 3:44:06.800]  of Bilderberg since 1954 and they make their solemn promise to report nothing they pressured
[3:44:06.800 --> 3:44:12.200]  AP to not use word Bilderberg so this is the so does it is completely discredit them Jim
[3:44:12.200 --> 3:44:16.400]  because they've said it doesn't exist all these decades everybody's heard this doesn't
[3:44:16.400 --> 3:44:20.840]  exist now they have to admit it that's a b there were a whole bunch of news articles
[3:44:20.840 --> 3:44:25.400]  one of the New York Times yesterday and it implied were delusional and doesn't exist
[3:44:25.400 --> 3:44:30.600]  other reviews of this film about myself and others you're in it it's called New World
[3:44:30.600 --> 3:44:36.400]  Order you know that crew that was following us around for a few years yeah there are actual
[3:44:36.400 --> 3:44:42.200]  film reviews I've read by major publications that say we are schizophrenic when we were
[3:44:42.200 --> 3:44:48.440]  in Chantilly Virginia that nothing happened there was no meeting Jim we are just complete
[3:44:48.440 --> 3:44:56.520]  loons AP doesn't exist this doesn't exist I could pull them up it was one that's out
[3:44:56.520 --> 3:45:01.880]  by Southwest I was like three different major film reviews saying Jones is insane and believes
[3:45:01.880 --> 3:45:07.000]  a secret group is meeting Jones believes they're hiding behind trees and following him Jones
[3:45:07.000 --> 3:45:15.800]  is insane yeah well they're cute but I mean that will discredit them won't it certainly
[3:45:15.800 --> 3:45:22.040]  will and as I say the where it is goes the among the American people well you saw it
[3:45:22.040 --> 3:45:28.000]  Chantilly all those young Ron Paul types of kids out there and we had Americans coming
[3:45:28.000 --> 3:45:37.640]  from as far away as Los Angeles to Greece to chase down Bilderberg and the as we said
[3:45:37.640 --> 3:45:45.720]  the number of reporters as usual in recent years in Europe has been very large the direct
[3:45:45.720 --> 3:45:52.040]  the more they make a nest themselves the more think they get what they do not want well it's
[3:45:52.040 --> 3:45:55.520]  like when they grab me for 15 hours that time and you had to come with the media and get
[3:45:55.520 --> 3:45:59.960]  me out of the jail cell basically that blew up in their face and was all over the news
[3:45:59.960 --> 3:46:06.680]  there was no coverage of it till they did that and that's exactly what they wanted to avoid
[3:46:06.680 --> 3:46:10.480]  well for masters of the world which they brag they are in their own minutes why can't they
[3:46:10.480 --> 3:46:15.880]  figure that out that arresting us is going to give more attention I don't think they're
[3:46:15.880 --> 3:46:22.200]  very bright but must be too much in reading Jim I'm not going to keep you much longer
[3:46:22.200 --> 3:46:28.680]  but any other observations on you got great reports in American Free Press dot net any
[3:46:28.680 --> 3:46:35.080]  anything else you learn from this year all patriots within sound of our voices to tell
[3:46:35.080 --> 3:46:43.000]  their carsmen and senators right now that they're going to be pressured to to embrace
[3:46:43.000 --> 3:46:48.080]  the international criminal court which of course would be another huge surrender of
[3:46:48.080 --> 3:46:54.040]  national sovereignty to the court to be superior to our own Supreme Court Bilderberg's instructive
[3:46:54.040 --> 3:47:01.160]  Obama is there with willing will keep us starting calling him to try to get past early in the
[3:47:01.160 --> 3:47:08.640]  year 2011 their strategy is that as you recall Bill Clinton Bilderberg himself signed off
[3:47:08.640 --> 3:47:12.480]  of the international criminal court but that's what the city showed more than 90 senators
[3:47:12.480 --> 3:47:17.160]  voting against it but many of those left wing senators did not want to vote against it but
[3:47:17.160 --> 3:47:22.960]  they were scared of their constituents because they heard from them now what Obama is when
[3:47:22.960 --> 3:47:28.120]  the sweet talk the left wing senators in his own party and maybe a couple of deserters
[3:47:28.120 --> 3:47:35.040]  of the republican party don't worry this can be done very quietly for the new and more
[3:47:35.040 --> 3:47:43.560]  left wing congress is elected in 2010 and January of 11 with a new new elected congress
[3:47:43.560 --> 3:47:51.560]  is seated on a Saturday night later on Saturday evening will quietly pass the city will quietly
[3:47:51.560 --> 3:47:56.620]  ratify the international criminal court and by the way that just won't kill sovereignty
[3:47:56.620 --> 3:48:02.040]  the international criminal court has no free speech no rights very tyrannical now what
[3:48:02.040 --> 3:48:07.080]  about Iran what about Iran is because the word is they've they're talking with Israel
[3:48:07.080 --> 3:48:11.120]  about letting them hit him in the next couple of years what do you know about that from
[3:48:11.120 --> 3:48:20.560]  Bilderberg Bilderberg is not very concerned about whether or not there'll be a big conflict
[3:48:20.560 --> 3:48:27.080]  migration in the Middle East with Israel doing a preemptive strike I don't know for sure about
[3:48:27.080 --> 3:48:32.000]  they're telling Israel to try to take a deep breath now because they are concerned of course
[3:48:32.000 --> 3:48:39.160]  they have heavy oil interest in the region themselves that Israel does right now cause
[3:48:39.160 --> 3:48:47.080]  a preemptive strike against Iran Iran fires back and there's a need for your holocaust
[3:48:47.080 --> 3:48:56.120]  in the Middle East so they seem to be very nervous about that all right what about their
[3:48:56.120 --> 3:49:00.160]  global carbon taxes we know they're getting those in Europe but they're having trouble
[3:49:00.160 --> 3:49:07.720]  in the US any word on that well they're still pressing for legislation they've had pending
[3:49:07.720 --> 3:49:12.440]  before the United Nations unknown to the American people it's a public at large for three years

[3:49:30.040 --> 3:49:35.240]  any purpose and then of course over the years it would be cracked up to a significant amount
[3:49:35.240 --> 3:49:39.680]  but to set the present the direct tax by the United Nations on the people of the world

[3:56:41.560 --> 3:56:46.840]  to launch a ground war against the united states they had no weapons had no targets weren't planning
[3:56:46.840 --> 3:56:52.680]  it it's the same thing here where the fbi created the group tried to give them the weapons
[3:56:53.400 --> 3:57:02.600]  and uh just just they do this to get anti-terror funding and to legitimize the myac report uh

[3:57:22.440 --> 3:57:27.000]  it's the nail in the head here explaining that it's like the military industrial complex
[3:57:27.000 --> 3:57:30.200]  but that it is uh basically a select group of corporations that want to
[3:57:31.960 --> 3:57:36.600]  shake down industry and business and taxpayers and control every facet of our lives
[3:57:36.600 --> 3:57:42.360]  so more and more truth coming out in mainstream uh media this by bjorn
[3:57:42.360 --> 3:57:47.160]  beyond lomborg out of the wall street journal i don't know how they let them do that in the
[3:57:47.160 --> 3:57:51.240]  wall street journal because rupert murdoch has directed all of his holdings we've played their
[3:57:51.240 --> 3:57:56.920]  own corporate piece they put out to all their corporate members to push and messages of global
[3:57:56.920 --> 3:58:01.480]  warming being real and being a dire threat we need a global corporate tax so that's an example
[3:58:01.480 --> 3:58:05.320]  of different camps within organizations of course he just bought the wall street journal a year ago
