[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:21.000]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:21.000 --> 00:26.600]  Okay, I'm going to be honest with listeners. I'm just going to lay it all out here on the
[00:26.600 --> 00:40.500]  table on this 21st day of February 2013, Thursday edition. This radio broadcast is growing by
[00:40.500 --> 00:46.120]  leaps and bounds. And we definitely more and more have the attention of the American people
[00:46.120 --> 00:48.940]  to a great extent and the people of the world.
[00:48.940 --> 00:53.120]  At least we have the attention of people that are trying to find out what's happening. And
[00:53.120 --> 00:58.920]  it's just an incredible responsibility. And I have a wonderful team of reporters, researchers,
[00:58.920 --> 01:04.400]  crew, you the listeners, the supporters, our friends in the media worldwide who love liberty
[01:04.400 --> 01:12.000]  as well. But occasionally, I'll listen to a rebroadcast of a show or part of it.
[01:12.000 --> 01:22.880]  And sometimes I'm really spot on, other times it is a bunch of gibbering. Because it is
[01:22.880 --> 01:27.320]  real and it's teleprompter free and there's no producer telling me what to do. I'm in
[01:27.320 --> 01:32.320]  charge. But as I've said to the globalist many times, they're in charge of the world.
[01:32.320 --> 01:37.440]  They're not in charge of themselves. And it's the same thing. I'm in charge, but I'm not
[01:37.440 --> 01:41.200]  really in charge of myself when it comes to this radio broadcast.
[01:41.200 --> 01:48.200]  And I think back to shows I did 10 years ago even. And I've gone back and listened to some
[01:48.200 --> 01:52.520]  of those where I was even more focused and would go through more news and get to more
[01:52.520 --> 01:58.920]  calls. And in ways the broadcast has gotten more informative and I've gotten more informed
[01:58.920 --> 02:02.080]  when it comes to how the world works as we all do.
[02:02.080 --> 02:08.800]  A wise man knows how little he knows. The fool thinks he knows everything. But I don't
[02:08.800 --> 02:12.680]  wanna say this broadcast is in a rut because we've added a lot of new things to it. It's
[02:12.680 --> 02:17.840]  gotten better. We've got the reporters, more and more special news pieces. It's just that
[02:17.840 --> 02:23.760]  at the level this broadcast has already made it, I am going to attempt to really shake
[02:23.760 --> 02:24.760]  the show up.
[02:24.760 --> 02:28.760]  And a lot of that means do I screen the phone calls as well? Because sometimes open the
[02:28.760 --> 02:32.740]  phones up on a specific topic, best calls in the world. But if I just open it up to
[02:32.740 --> 02:36.120]  general stuff, it's guys calling in who are on their day off who are already into a half
[02:36.120 --> 02:41.120]  bottle of whiskey, which is fine. It's just that I'm not sitting around with the local
[02:41.120 --> 02:48.000]  VFW shooting the breeze, having a few suds. So there's that issue.
[02:48.000 --> 02:53.200]  There's the issue of the frustration of every day I come in here and I've scanned over before
[02:53.200 --> 02:57.400]  I got here and then when I get here, sometimes 200 articles, usually about 100. I've got
[02:57.400 --> 03:00.680]  all these video clips, all these reports, all this incredible information, all these
[03:00.680 --> 03:04.300]  insights to try to transmit to you.
[03:04.300 --> 03:10.920]  But I get so excited and go into a rant mode. And the first hour is generally the best hour
[03:10.920 --> 03:15.200]  for my content. And then we usually have guests on because I know that I tend to degenerate
[03:15.200 --> 03:19.560]  by the second and third hour. And it's on the days where I don't have guests, where
[03:19.560 --> 03:22.520]  I decide to not have guests, that that becomes evident.
[03:22.520 --> 03:25.720]  And I'm probably over analyzing this. It's just that these are extraordinary times we're
[03:25.720 --> 03:38.160]  in, very extraordinary times. And so I must, absolutely must, get myself to the point of
[03:38.160 --> 03:42.240]  where I'm in control. Because I'll say I'm gonna go to your calls, I don't go to them.
[03:42.240 --> 03:45.500]  Or when I do, I'll let a caller go too long.
[03:45.500 --> 03:50.380]  Or I say I'm gonna cover something in the next hour, I start covering it right then,
[03:50.380 --> 03:54.060]  and then never fully cover it. And it's just I'm gonna tell you, you've got this commitment
[03:54.060 --> 03:59.440]  from Alex Jones. Because we're getting on more and more stations, because more and more
[03:59.440 --> 04:02.020]  mfullwars.com is a household name.
[04:02.020 --> 04:06.400]  Because of the responsibility we've got, cuz nobody's telling me up my game. I'm saying
[04:06.400 --> 04:13.680]  it. I'm saying it. A lot of times I'm a travesty. And people come up and thank me and say how
[04:13.680 --> 04:18.360]  great I am. And it's like punching me in the stomach, because I just wanna beat the tyrants.
[04:18.360 --> 04:22.840]  And then I know how horrible I am. And these people are counting on me. I don't know how
[04:22.840 --> 04:23.840]  to explain it.
[04:23.840 --> 04:30.040]  One of my good friends had a heart attack a few weeks ago. And he was telling me that
[04:30.040 --> 04:34.560]  he got mad. He felt like he let his family down. 60 something years old, having a heart
[04:34.560 --> 04:38.040]  attack. And somebody that doesn't know what it is to be a man, they don't understand that.
[04:38.040 --> 04:43.840]  A man with children, a man with responsibilities. It's like people are saying, you're so great.
[04:43.840 --> 04:48.600]  And it makes you go, man, I gotta do even better. You see what I'm saying? It's like,
[04:48.600 --> 04:52.340]  that's why it's painful when you tell me how great I am. Because I know the potential is
[04:52.340 --> 04:57.600]  like 500 times better. We'll be right back with incredibly important news. Stay with
[04:57.600 --> 05:00.640]  us.

[06:15.160 --> 06:20.240]  Tyrannical governments control people by controlling their food supply. Don't be dependent. Be

[07:00.480 --> 07:05.160]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our
[07:05.160 --> 07:10.800]  immunity and health. At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing
[07:10.800 --> 07:16.240]  a full selection of silver-based products. Our most popular silver-based products are

[07:29.680 --> 07:34.480]  gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver
[07:34.480 --> 07:40.000]  at the surface. But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin-nourishing
[07:40.000 --> 07:45.080]  chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin, while delivering the
[07:45.080 --> 07:53.480]  silver more effectively. Visit www.SilverLungs.com and click on our store page to find what silver-based
[07:53.480 --> 07:58.720]  products are best for you. That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[07:58.720 --> 08:12.120]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwanted influence,
[08:12.120 --> 08:16.960]  whether sought or unsought, by the Military Industrial Conference.
[08:16.960 --> 08:21.960]  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown
[08:21.960 --> 08:27.920]  Dallas. The first reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by this
[08:27.920 --> 08:28.920]  shooting.
[08:28.920 --> 08:33.920]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[08:33.920 --> 08:42.920]  It was almost as if we were a planned employer. It just pancakes.
[08:42.920 --> 08:56.920]  Either you were with us, or you were with the terrorists.
[08:56.920 --> 09:03.920]  But I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands
[09:03.920 --> 09:08.920]  of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[09:08.920 --> 09:12.920]  Guns will be taken. No one will ever be armed. We're going to take all guns.
[09:12.920 --> 09:17.920]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American
[09:17.920 --> 09:18.920]  city.
[09:18.920 --> 09:22.920]  Is global governance at last? Is it one world the central bank is in charge? But aren't
[09:22.920 --> 09:25.920]  we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[09:25.920 --> 09:31.920]  And for me, give me liberty or give me death!
[09:31.920 --> 09:38.920]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[09:38.920 --> 09:47.920]  I don't know how anyone out there could say that they're bored. A great animating contest
[09:47.920 --> 09:54.920]  between the forces of total despotism and a scientific worldwide technocratic tyranny
[09:54.920 --> 10:00.920]  are attempting to eradicate what we know of as the normal operating system of the human
[10:00.920 --> 10:01.920]  species.
[10:01.920 --> 10:08.920]  And evolve us, I put that in quotes, devolve us, into their technotronic man-machine interface
[10:08.920 --> 10:12.920]  age, of which only a select few will enter in the future.
[10:12.920 --> 10:20.920]  And I have some articles on the technological front that integrate in and illustrate, or
[10:20.920 --> 10:24.920]  illustrate, of what I want to cover on that subject, and I'll do that later in the second
[10:24.920 --> 10:27.920]  hour today. I will get to it.
[10:27.920 --> 10:31.920]  We're also going to look at the destabilized Middle East program. Why are the globalists
[10:31.920 --> 10:37.920]  putting radicals in charge everywhere? How does it tie into the larger geopolitical systems?
[10:37.920 --> 10:42.920]  We're also going to look at John Kerry, the Secretary of State, the globalists, the Skull
[10:42.920 --> 10:50.920]  Bones member, running around pushing climate change and carbon taxes is the most important
[10:50.920 --> 10:55.920]  thing America faces, his first speech as Secretary of State.
[10:55.920 --> 11:00.920]  The national and local media in Wisconsin has gone into conniption-fit overdrive over
[11:00.920 --> 11:06.920]  the sheriff, Clark, in Milwaukee County, and what he said on this show. And before I even
[11:06.920 --> 11:13.920]  saw this article this morning, I intended to come on air and call yet again. But here
[11:13.920 --> 11:19.920]  we are a few months later with an update for a second American Revolution, but a peaceful
[11:19.920 --> 11:22.920]  revolution ahead of them starting a violent one.
[11:22.920 --> 11:27.920]  And the sheriff agreed. He said, it'll be up to the American people when this is going
[11:27.920 --> 11:32.920]  to start. The American people will decide when to push back, not me. And they're scared
[11:32.920 --> 11:39.920]  of Clark because I read his resume, the guy's like a super cop, before he became sheriff
[11:39.920 --> 11:40.920]  of that county.
[11:40.920 --> 11:46.920]  And they're afraid of the now 400, it's now over 400, it was 350 just four or five days
[11:46.920 --> 11:51.920]  ago, sheriff saying they're gonna fight the New World Order. And look, the intel's out,
[11:51.920 --> 11:55.920]  okay? It's not like it's our opinion we're going into a tyranny, as Sheriff Clark has
[11:55.920 --> 12:04.920]  said. I mean, they're really afraid of focused, handsome, smart with great record police officers,
[12:04.920 --> 12:07.920]  sheriffs, but anybody else that can be a leader.
[12:07.920 --> 12:12.920]  And they really hate this guy cuz he's black. And I saw something special in him in the
[12:12.920 --> 12:16.920]  TV interviews I saw, that's why we got him on. They're really scared of people like this.
[12:16.920 --> 12:22.920]  You know why? Cuz conservatives and libertarians would follow somebody like Clark in a minute,
[12:22.920 --> 12:26.920]  and they want division, they don't want unity.
[12:26.920 --> 12:31.920]  They don't want us having unity under liberty, under private property, under due process,
[12:31.920 --> 12:36.920]  under the family, under law and order enshrined in the Second Amendment, what made this country
[12:36.920 --> 12:40.920]  so powerful. Cuz this country's got a lot of evil in its history. But compared to other
[12:40.920 --> 12:44.920]  nations, which they never teach you about, we have been the best.
[12:44.920 --> 12:49.920]  The best in science, the best in sports, the best in research, the best in development,
[12:49.920 --> 12:56.920]  the best in courage, the best in war. Because we had the best shot at freedom, a head start
[12:56.920 --> 13:01.920]  on everybody else. That's why they don't teach you the founders tried to get rid of slavery,
[13:01.920 --> 13:05.920]  but the British government threatened to reinvade if they did.
[13:05.920 --> 13:09.920]  They don't tell you slavery was going on every other place in the world at that time. They
[13:09.920 --> 13:15.920]  only tell you America, because they want to demonize the republic and the idea in it.
[13:15.920 --> 13:24.920]  Because it's anathema to monopolies, it's anathema to cartels. It's anathema to royalty
[13:24.920 --> 13:32.920]  and insiders. What is royalty? It is generational mafia, it is generational strongmen, it is
[13:32.920 --> 13:36.920]  North Korea. I predict within another generation will be wearing gold crowns.
[13:36.920 --> 13:40.920]  In fact, they already have him wearing royal hats and saying that the sun comes out because
[13:40.920 --> 13:45.920]  of Kim Jong Il's grandfather or Kim Jong Il's father and Kim Jong Un and all the rest of
[13:45.920 --> 13:52.920]  it. That's what we're fighting is the stagnation of elites that don't wanna compete and who
[13:52.920 --> 13:59.920]  wanna dominate everybody. Now here's the deal. I've meant to do this the last few months
[13:59.920 --> 14:06.920]  and so many times I don't get into the really weighty issues because I think at a subconscious
[14:06.920 --> 14:12.920]  level I feel like, as I know many of you feel, that I'm not worthy to be trying to launch
[14:12.920 --> 14:13.920]  something this big.
[14:13.920 --> 14:18.920]  Well, none of us are worthy. All of us have fallen short, but it doesn't matter. The fact
[14:18.920 --> 14:25.920]  is we have a duty. And so I have procrastinated and written up notes many times. I don't know,
[14:25.920 --> 14:29.920]  three months ago I called for a second American Revolution, a peaceful restoration, a plan.
[14:29.920 --> 14:33.920]  I had many constitutional top lawyers on. They concur with my analysis and said it's
[14:33.920 --> 14:38.920]  actually found in the Declaration of Independence, Constitution, Bill of Rights, Federalist Papers,
[14:38.920 --> 14:43.920]  Anti-Federalist Papers, and gave different pathways for the basic plan I developed that
[14:43.920 --> 14:49.920]  was just based on a re-upload of the Bill of Rights and Constitution via the Declaration
[14:49.920 --> 14:50.920]  of Independence.
[14:50.920 --> 14:59.920]  So it's not really my plan. I simply stated that a revolution, a restoration of the Republic,
[14:59.920 --> 15:04.920]  when you hear about it is our right, our duty to throw off oppressive governments and to
[15:04.920 --> 15:11.920]  make new ones for the protection of the people's rights and liberties. To paraphrase the Declaration
[15:11.920 --> 15:19.920]  of Independence, that is the total plan there stating the inherent right is in all of us.
[15:19.920 --> 15:25.920]  We the people are the boss. We are the sovereigns. And so the media has always sold a Declaration
[15:25.920 --> 15:29.920]  of Independence as a bad thing because it's saying the government can be abolished. And
[15:29.920 --> 15:34.920]  then they sold that like it will abolish the Republic, it will abolish America, it will
[15:34.920 --> 15:38.920]  abolish DC, the federal government.
[15:38.920 --> 15:45.920]  DC and the federal government has been overrun and captured and the Republic has been abolished
[15:45.920 --> 15:50.920]  and even the American empire is to be phased out and abolished and transferred into NATO
[15:50.920 --> 15:55.920]  and the communist Chinese as the two main seats of power where the United States is
[15:55.920 --> 16:03.920]  a Hessian mercenary military supply system. And even that's only a ten year program because
[16:03.920 --> 16:06.920]  after that it goes total robot.
[16:06.920 --> 16:13.920]  I mean, this is the real world we're talking about. This is humans being phased out. This
[16:13.920 --> 16:17.920]  is humans not needed and you can point at the slob like public, point ourselves, I'll
[16:17.920 --> 16:25.920]  point it myself. A shadow compared to my forebears, undoubtedly, because adversity makes men,
[16:25.920 --> 16:27.920]  prosperity makes monsters.
[16:27.920 --> 16:34.920]  But as bent as I am, I'm not half as bent as the general public and I don't take pleasure
[16:34.920 --> 16:43.920]  out of their societal deformities. I feel great pain in it because my children and my
[16:43.920 --> 16:50.920]  progeny and my bloodlines flow out into the future. And I stand between the past and the
[16:50.920 --> 16:57.920]  future, learning from both, wishing to go forward with good cheer and good heart and
[16:57.920 --> 16:58.920]  goodwill.
[16:58.920 --> 17:05.920]  Goodwill, I have goodwill. I want to build up. I don't wanna be cynical. I don't wanna
[17:05.920 --> 17:10.920]  cheat people and get ahead and laugh at them. I want to build them up. But the dangerous
[17:10.920 --> 17:16.920]  horde screaming for blood is being taught by the technocrats that they will tear apart
[17:16.920 --> 17:25.920]  those of us that produce and feed on us in a predatory implosion syndrome that I liken
[17:25.920 --> 17:33.920]  to a cannibalistic, neo-feudalistic, controlled road warrior collapse, which they call Agenda
[17:33.920 --> 17:36.920]  21 in the post-industrial system.
[17:36.920 --> 17:44.920]  I mean, this is an epic time to be alive, an epic plan we face. Epic, eugenicist-based
[17:44.920 --> 17:48.920]  technocrat globalist who you gotta hand it to them, have had a long-term nightmare plan
[17:48.920 --> 17:54.920]  and have really carried a lot of it out. They're about 10 years behind. I mean, it's epic.
[17:54.920 --> 17:59.920]  And a lot of technocrats will say, well, Alex, they're in control. We're in control. Speaking
[17:59.920 --> 18:02.920]  of themselves, we're going to win.
[18:02.920 --> 18:08.920]  And you should just try to join us. Isn't the fact that we're in control the evidence
[18:08.920 --> 18:14.920]  that we should be in charge? And I sat there and watched a lot of my family die of cancer.
[18:14.920 --> 18:19.920]  And I've watched friends die of cancer. I've watched people take their last breaths. Even
[18:19.920 --> 18:23.920]  though it was painful, it was important moments to experience that death, not to hide away
[18:23.920 --> 18:25.920]  from it, to see it, to know how transient we are.
[18:25.920 --> 18:32.920]  Out, out, brief candle to quote Shakespeare. And I have sat there and watched people battle
[18:32.920 --> 18:37.920]  cancer. And I've said this before, I'll say it again. If cancer had a consciousness, it
[18:37.920 --> 18:42.920]  would think it was winning. No, you are not winning and you do not have a right to be
[18:42.920 --> 18:43.920]  doing what you're doing.
[18:43.920 --> 18:50.920]  Because your eugenics would be bad enough if you were killing the infirm and the stupid.
[18:50.920 --> 18:55.920]  But you are targeting the beautiful and the intelligent and the enlightened because you're
[18:55.920 --> 19:02.920]  threatened by it. And that is just beyond, beyond evil. You people are cancer.
[19:02.920 --> 19:05.920]  Now I want to just take calls. I'm not going to go to news in the next 40 minutes. I'm
[19:05.920 --> 19:09.920]  going to take your calls, first time callers, on how do you think we fix America and the
[19:09.920 --> 19:11.920]  world? What do you think the big false flag is going to be?
[19:11.920 --> 19:15.920]  What do you think of millions, $2 million worth of targets, some of them are as low
[19:15.920 --> 19:19.920]  as $5 apiece. I don't know how many targets that is, of children to be shot, old women,
[19:19.920 --> 19:24.920]  old men, all of them the new white al-Qaeda, the new shift to that. What do you think about
[19:24.920 --> 19:29.920]  that report? First time callers, have your point ready. I will take a bunch of your calls.
[19:29.920 --> 19:38.920]  I'm in disciplined focus mode, 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231. And then I'll take your calls
[19:38.920 --> 19:43.920]  and I'll start my engines on the news and a new refocus on the Second American Revolution
[19:43.920 --> 19:48.920]  and how it ties into headlines and how to wrest control of humanity from the jaws of
[19:48.920 --> 19:54.920]  the psychopathic technocrat guild. I'm Alex Jones, your host and fullwars.com and prison

[22:28.920 --> 22:32.920]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors
[22:32.920 --> 22:37.920]  won't talk about gold IRAs? They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry

[24:20.920 --> 24:34.920]  By the way, Mortal Technique's in town right now. I think he's going to come over and do
[24:34.920 --> 24:37.920]  the nightly news with me tonight. So that should be an interesting interview tonight,
[24:37.920 --> 24:42.920]  7 o'clock central. Basically, we've announced the giant online film festival that's Operation
[24:42.920 --> 24:47.920]  Paul Revere, a new video out on that subject. We're going to be playing a clip of that.
[24:47.920 --> 24:52.920]  Stocks plunge as Fed members admit endless bond buying will not fix the economy. That's
[24:52.920 --> 24:57.920]  just some of the news we're going to focus on in that area. But as I said, how do we
[24:57.920 --> 25:01.920]  defeat the globalists? We're going to be discussing that when I start the next hour and then go
[25:01.920 --> 25:05.920]  back into your calls. Right now, let's go to your phone calls that I was just speaking
[25:05.920 --> 25:09.920]  of. John in Maryland, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[25:09.920 --> 25:22.920]  Hello there, Alex. I heard you kind of criticizing yourself. I often listen to the show and I
[25:22.920 --> 25:29.920]  hear the neocons from time to time as well. And your worst show usually dwarfs their best
[25:29.920 --> 25:30.920]  show.
[25:30.920 --> 25:36.920]  Oh, I know that. I'm just simply saying I want to refocus on real solutions. And that's
[25:36.920 --> 25:40.920]  exposing the crimes of the globalists and then talking about ways to defeat them. So
[25:40.920 --> 25:45.920]  I don't really want to get off into. I mean, I've already made my statements on how I'm
[25:45.920 --> 25:48.920]  going to try to focus the show. Go ahead and make a point. Thank you.
[25:48.920 --> 25:56.920]  Also, I wanted to mention the modified atmosphere several months ago. I obtained and I want
[25:56.920 --> 26:01.920]  to encourage others to do it if they've already done it. Great. And others should need to
[26:01.920 --> 26:07.920]  do this as well. Get a hold of a microscope. Get some rain samples. Look at your rain under
[26:07.920 --> 26:17.920]  a microscope. Look at what is falling on you. It's mind boggling. I have water samples still
[26:17.920 --> 26:22.920]  that I have kept for several months in my refrigerator. And it's amazing what happens
[26:22.920 --> 26:31.920]  over the long term. The little glass containers I have the water in when I first collected
[26:31.920 --> 26:36.920]  it with the cap on it. If you shook it off, it looked like Santa Claus should be standing
[26:36.920 --> 26:42.920]  in there. And now over the course of several months, all of those disgusting fibers and
[26:42.920 --> 26:49.920]  God knows what that's in there has all clumped together. And you should shoot a YouTube video
[26:49.920 --> 26:53.920]  of that to show it, but that's really unscientific and I'm not poo pooing the fact that you're
[26:53.920 --> 26:54.920]  doing that.
[26:54.920 --> 26:58.920]  That's a good way to start out observing things and I appreciate your call. Here's my issue
[26:58.920 --> 27:05.920]  with weather modification. Let's not exaggerate. There are 20,000 different papers. That's
[27:05.920 --> 27:09.920]  a conservative number. You can go look at it on Google. Universities, Department of
[27:09.920 --> 27:14.920]  Energy, other governments, UN treaties on weather modification, they call it all testing.
[27:14.920 --> 27:19.920]  And it's going on everywhere. Al Gore talked about it on Ellen last week, admitted it was
[27:19.920 --> 27:24.920]  going on and said he thought it was a crazy idea, which is ridiculous, and then said isn't
[27:24.920 --> 27:25.920]  the weather scary?
[27:25.920 --> 27:30.920]  And there's undoubtedly I've interviewed, let's not exaggerate, five, six meteorologists,
[27:30.920 --> 27:35.920]  some of them that actually work at TV stations saying clearly you can see the jets come in,
[27:35.920 --> 27:40.920]  the military aircraft block fronts, make fronts worse. It was in the San Antonio Express News
[27:40.920 --> 27:46.080]  like 15 years ago there was a big flood and it killed 34 people, I think, in one night
[27:46.080 --> 27:47.360]  in South Texas.
[27:47.360 --> 27:51.940]  And they said the Navy says their weather mod's spraying. Was it involved in this? Just
[27:51.940 --> 27:59.840]  a footnote in there. So my frustration is I've done special reports. I've had guests
[27:59.840 --> 28:05.140]  on. I've promoted two films we sell, What in the World Are They Spraying and Why Are
[28:05.140 --> 28:10.740]  They Spraying, that are available at Infowarsstore.com, where it goes through, I mean, I've sent my
[28:10.740 --> 28:13.760]  crew two weather mod conferences.
[28:13.760 --> 28:17.420]  And it's not just little companies doing it, making the ski slopes have snow. It's not
[28:17.420 --> 28:22.800]  just things like that. It's big, giant government and corporate operations. Bill Gates spends
[28:22.800 --> 28:31.720]  billions a year with a B, manipulating hurricanes, manipulating snow storms. And then we say,
[28:31.720 --> 28:33.440]  hey, the Russians say they control the weather.
[28:33.440 --> 28:38.640]  The Chinese are doing it. They're doing it in Dubai. Hey, our government pioneered this
[28:38.640 --> 28:41.920]  and I've interviewed the father of weather weapons. I think he's still alive. He's like
[28:41.920 --> 28:45.860]  95 years old, Ben Livingston. He first flew into hurricanes and typhoons and things. He
[28:45.860 --> 28:50.760]  could take a cloudless sky and flood the Ho Chi Minh Trail with 10 feet of water.
[28:50.760 --> 28:55.920]  That interview is up at prisonplanet.tv. The father of weather weapons, Ben Livingston.
[28:55.920 --> 29:01.660]  And no one ever wants to talk about that or the aerosol spraying program or the Department
[29:01.660 --> 29:08.640]  of Energy programs or all the admissions. It's all admitted that the government has
[29:08.640 --> 29:15.920]  declassified thousands of lethal chemical, biological, radiological releases on the public.
[29:15.920 --> 29:18.560]  And then every time I get called or something on the street, they're like, did you see the
[29:18.560 --> 29:23.600]  chemtrails? Will you talk more about them? Hey, I think they're doing this. What do you
[29:23.600 --> 29:24.600]  think they're doing?
[29:24.600 --> 29:30.440]  I know exactly what they're doing. I have the patents where they add the barium salts,
[29:30.440 --> 29:35.360]  aluminum dioxide to the three major jet fuel manufacturers, part of a national security
[29:35.360 --> 29:39.400]  compartmentalization. It's been sprayed out even from those jets. They have specialized
[29:39.400 --> 29:43.960]  jets. It's all a public program. It's like, can we prove there's a new world order? It's
[29:43.960 --> 29:49.800]  all hiding in plain view. I mean, it's going on. More calls coming up.
[29:49.800 --> 30:00.280]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[33:07.960 --> 33:14.480]  Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[33:14.480 --> 33:22.600]  Yeah, that's what the police said they were going to do. We're going to burn that house
[33:22.600 --> 33:27.360]  down. Burn that effing house down. Burn him up. Bring in the fire. Burn him up. Okay,
[33:27.360 --> 33:31.480]  the burners are placed. They're on fire. We have fire. Mission completed. The house is
[33:31.480 --> 33:36.240]  burned down. They're like, we didn't burn him down. That's a conspiracy theory. And
[33:36.240 --> 33:41.840]  CNN, as I predicted, said Alex Jones and his conspiracy theory that the police burned that
[33:41.840 --> 33:43.040]  down.
[33:43.040 --> 33:49.480]  Alex Jones is helping Dorner. Remember that clip from a few days ago? This shows that
[33:49.480 --> 33:55.460]  reality and common sense is what the system is at war with because common sense says we
[33:55.460 --> 34:00.800]  have a big fat criminal government and an establishment that's grown up around it that
[34:00.800 --> 34:05.720]  is feeding on us and it needs to stop. Now, now finishing up on the weather modification
[34:05.720 --> 34:10.920]  point that the last caller brought up, which is a very good point, that yes, there is all
[34:10.920 --> 34:15.720]  sorts of normal bacteria, spiderwebs, debris in the atmosphere.
[34:15.720 --> 34:19.520]  There's also the jet stream that goes over India and China that dumps over the Midwest
[34:19.520 --> 34:24.160]  filled with toxic waste. They're always going, we found more toxic waste in the air, more
[34:24.160 --> 34:29.080]  taxes locally, more catalytic converters on your tractor. Nothing's coming out of the
[34:29.080 --> 34:34.360]  tractor but water vapor and carbon dioxide and some carbon monoxide, but they'll still
[34:34.360 --> 34:38.800]  tax you because China has everything burning dirty.
[34:38.800 --> 34:44.040]  The river's catching on fire, dirtier environment than anywhere on Earth's ever had, but there's
[34:44.040 --> 34:47.980]  no discussion of that at all. We're gonna shut your power plants down that are clean
[34:47.980 --> 34:52.900]  and let China have whatever they want because there's pollutants in the air, but never discussion
[34:52.900 --> 34:55.100]  of where they came from.
[34:55.100 --> 34:59.820]  But on the issue of the weather modification, it's one of the biggest issues and we've done
[34:59.820 --> 35:04.280]  special reports on it. We'll do more special reports on it, but look up UN trees on weather
[35:04.280 --> 35:12.640]  modification 1978. Look up the other treaties, it's all going on and they're using bad weather.
[35:12.640 --> 35:18.100]  There is some unusual weather going on to devastate certain areas of the world, weather
[35:18.100 --> 35:19.100]  as a weapon.
[35:19.100 --> 35:24.280]  The Secretary of Defense William Cohen talked about in the April issue of Army Times, April
[35:24.280 --> 35:29.560]  18th issue of Army Times, where he gave a press conference and talked about weather
[35:29.560 --> 35:34.480]  weapons. So yes, weather weapons are real and undoubtedly there's weather mod going
[35:34.480 --> 35:36.120]  on, on a giant scale.
[35:36.120 --> 35:40.280]  Yeah, there's the UN weapons tree. Let's scroll down and see if my memory was right about
[35:40.280 --> 35:48.320]  78. Well, that's one on 1972, they must have updated it in 77 and then in 78, yeah. So
[35:48.320 --> 35:53.780]  I guess the latest version was 1978, started in 72. I mean, the point is, see, they know
[35:53.780 --> 35:59.400]  the public so ignorant, they're like, I heard there's a UN, never saw it, but heard it's
[35:59.400 --> 36:00.400]  there.
[36:00.400 --> 36:04.080]  I heard there's FEMA camps, I heard the military is trying to take our guns. Well, go watch
[36:04.080 --> 36:08.220]  my films, I mean, you'll see them trying to take your guns. You can read it in the newspaper
[36:08.220 --> 36:14.660]  if you want. I heard there's a plan to forcibly inoculate us. It's the Model States Health
[36:14.660 --> 36:18.360]  Emergency Powers Act, yes, I just gave you the name of it. I heard there's a plan to
[36:18.360 --> 36:21.920]  have the Army have forced labor, civilian inmate labor camp program.
[36:21.920 --> 36:26.480]  I mean, you type that into army.mil, you're gonna get all the maps, the documents, the
[36:26.480 --> 36:32.340]  names, everything. See, it's all going on, reality is going on, and then you've got what
[36:32.340 --> 36:36.760]  the TV heads are getting. I was talking to Weldon Henson last night, we went shooting
[36:36.760 --> 36:40.840]  yesterday evening with some of my other friends, the Steiners.
[36:40.840 --> 36:44.160]  And he was talking about, I don't watch a lot of TV, I'm gonna go to your calls here
[36:44.160 --> 36:48.680]  in a moment, but I like Hawaii Five-O, the new one. But he goes, I gotta quit watching
[36:48.680 --> 36:54.260]  it. I'll get home tired on Monday nights, and he also plays country music four nights
[36:54.260 --> 36:58.000]  a week live, pretty popular band.
[36:58.000 --> 37:05.040]  And Weldon Henson, man, and he said, I'll get home with my wife and I'll try to watch
[37:05.040 --> 37:10.440]  that and just forget about stuff. But it's the new generation, it's got Danno's son and
[37:10.440 --> 37:15.540]  McGarrett's son. And he said basically every episode lined up with Dorner exactly. While
[37:15.540 --> 37:24.120]  that was happening, that episode aired, where a Vietnam vet is shooting police officers
[37:24.120 --> 37:25.600]  sniper style.
[37:25.600 --> 37:29.520]  And the veterans and gun owners are bad, and Danno and McGarrett are like, we've gotta
[37:29.520 --> 37:33.280]  get rid of the Second Amendment. I'm sure a lot of you saw the episode, it's a popular
[37:33.280 --> 37:39.520]  show. We've gotta get rid of the Second Amendment, and there is no right to own guns, guns are
[37:39.520 --> 37:43.440]  the problem. And McGarrett and Danno win the argument, and at the end, it's time to turn
[37:43.440 --> 37:45.960]  all the guns in, the veterans are the terrorists.
[37:45.960 --> 37:51.640]  And of course, Weldon's an Air Force veteran, was a bomb loader and worked on diagnostics
[37:51.640 --> 37:57.920]  and stuff. But the point is, believe me, that's a veteran, that's a dangerous job. So all
[37:57.920 --> 38:03.320]  of this type of stuff goes on, and you get turned on television here, you're the terrorist.
[38:03.320 --> 38:07.160]  And again, it hasn't happened yet, they've got actuaries where they know vets aren't
[38:07.160 --> 38:11.360]  gonna give your pension funds up or your guns, and they're gonna have a war with you.
[38:11.360 --> 38:15.640]  And so the targets are of veterans, and the manuals are of veterans, and the TV shows
[38:15.640 --> 38:19.240]  are of veterans. Cuz it's not just the four shows, Weldon said you better watch some other
[38:19.240 --> 38:24.000]  TV show. It's not just founding fathers, and I hate Paul Revere and all this stuff. It's
[38:24.000 --> 38:27.040]  every show, every show my wife watches.
[38:27.040 --> 38:30.020]  People that don't take vaccines are child molesters, people that don't take vaccines
[38:30.020 --> 38:34.200]  are child murderers, people that are concerned about the government are terrorists. And the
[38:34.200 --> 38:38.820]  general public who doesn't know their head from a hole in the ground, can't find their
[38:38.820 --> 38:44.400]  butt with both hands. They're all being taught that those of us that are aware of this are
[38:44.400 --> 38:45.400]  the terrorists.
[38:45.400 --> 38:50.520]  They're gonna sic the general public on us when the depression really gets bad, and say,
[38:50.520 --> 38:54.680]  take everything they got and we'll turn the money back on. Pass Obamacare, we'll turn
[38:54.680 --> 38:58.400]  the money back on. They're like, I'm going bankrupt, it costs twice as much, everything's
[38:58.400 --> 39:03.880]  shutting down. More socialism will fix it, all right, things are even worse, communism
[39:03.880 --> 39:04.880]  will fix it.
[39:04.880 --> 39:11.320]  Okay, things are even worse, go to this forced labor camp, we'll feed you there, all right?
[39:11.320 --> 39:14.900]  You'll be a jail guard and help kill your neighbors, you'll get food, all right? This
[39:14.900 --> 39:18.600]  is how the authoritarians do it. And if you don't wake up to the mind control, it's over.
[39:18.600 --> 39:22.160]  Now, I said I'd take a bunch of calls, I'm gonna move quickly. I cannot let the callers
[39:22.160 --> 39:27.000]  distract me, even though they're great points to go off in dissertations. Let's go to Chad
[39:27.000 --> 39:28.840]  in South Carolina, you're on the air, Chad.
[39:28.840 --> 39:33.600]  Hey, Alex, it's funny you were just mentioning those shows because you asked what the next
[39:33.600 --> 39:39.280]  false flag would be, and I think it's gonna be power out, lights out. One reason I think
[39:39.280 --> 39:45.480]  that is the new NBC series, it's not new, but the revolution, or revolution. The lights
[39:45.480 --> 39:48.000]  go out and the economy collapses.
[39:48.000 --> 39:53.520]  No, no, no, every show, every movie is the race memory for humans to expect, cuz humans
[39:53.520 --> 39:58.180]  are adaptive, the globalists say this. They're gonna teach us that mass death, mass collapse
[39:58.180 --> 40:04.440]  is coming. So as they engineer the slow collapse of Gena 21, we will expect it, yes.
[40:04.440 --> 40:10.880]  So the revolution, the American flag is the rebel flag, guns have been banned, and it's
[40:10.880 --> 40:13.920]  just they're putting this stuff out there, and we're gonna get desensitized to it, like
[40:13.920 --> 40:14.920]  you said.
[40:14.920 --> 40:18.560]  No, it's total psych warfare on record. I read articles two weeks ago where the head
[40:18.560 --> 40:24.640]  UN official at what, it was Stanford, gave a speech and admitted, we've used the cinema,
[40:24.640 --> 40:28.920]  the dramas, and the sitcoms to get rid of the family, now we're gonna drop the hammer.
[40:28.920 --> 40:33.640]  It's an hour, ten minute video admitting it. Do you understand, if you're a new listener,
[40:33.640 --> 40:39.040]  it's not a liberal bias, it's an authoritarian takeover bias. Go ahead, I'm sorry.
[40:39.040 --> 40:45.680]  So Fox News a couple days ago runs a show about China hacking the Intel network or Intel
[40:45.680 --> 40:49.760]  and it runs the power grid. So they're saying, can you imagine what seven days on the East
[40:49.760 --> 40:54.280]  Coast, and they said East Coast, would be without power? And that's the thing, it's
[40:54.280 --> 40:59.560]  like East Coast versus West Coast or Southeast versus the rest of the, we have Texas.
[40:59.560 --> 41:04.480]  And by the way, the globalist, again, set up China, set up the communist on record,
[41:04.480 --> 41:09.080]  it's declassified, publicly hiding in plain view. The elite are working China against
[41:09.080 --> 41:13.820]  America, but America against China, they wanna kill the Chinese people, they wanna get rid
[41:13.820 --> 41:14.960]  of us as well.
[41:14.960 --> 41:20.560]  It's that global elite allied with China, it's the globalist allied with China against
[41:20.560 --> 41:26.240]  Russia, Russia's corrupt as well. China is allied though, and I agree with Joel Skalzen,
[41:26.240 --> 41:31.860]  they plan on flipping that alliance at some point. But remember, the globalist or eugenicist,
[41:31.860 --> 41:34.280]  they're playing everyone off against each other.
[41:34.280 --> 41:39.680]  And yes, they're getting us ready for a false flag to blame the patriots, hackers or China
[41:39.680 --> 41:45.800]  for power outages, when everyone knows the real power grid is not hooked up to the Internet.
[41:45.800 --> 41:51.920]  Stuxnet with the Iranians had to be injected directly into the industrial energy transference
[41:51.920 --> 41:56.400]  grid centers, the load balancing centers.
[41:56.400 --> 42:03.080]  It sounds exactly like a false flag if they're saying China can hack in and they can't even
[42:03.080 --> 42:04.080]  attack a grid.
[42:04.080 --> 42:07.800]  And it's total horse crap. And in fact, I think that was staged with a zombie hack up
[42:07.800 --> 42:12.400]  in Montana or Wyoming where they hack into the TV station and go zombies are taking over,
[42:12.400 --> 42:14.200]  the undead are rising from their graves.
[42:14.200 --> 42:20.720]  And that was hacking just the local computer for the federal EAS takeover system.
[42:20.720 --> 42:24.400]  But as soon as the grid fails, you know the first thing is gonna be everybody turning
[42:24.400 --> 42:28.600]  your guns, just like Katrina, just like any event, you know?
[42:28.600 --> 42:34.840]  No, that's it, they've set the default. Listen, 14 years ago, when I went to my first big
[42:34.840 --> 42:40.400]  urban warfare, it's 15 years ago, and I witnessed Marines trying to take our guns and training
[42:40.400 --> 42:41.400]  for America.
[42:41.400 --> 42:46.400]  And then I turned on CNN that night who'd been there, troops are training for Macedonian
[42:46.400 --> 42:53.320]  conflict to help with UN peacekeepers in Oakland today. And I had all the footage and the public
[42:53.320 --> 42:58.000]  was so weak minded, when I put that film out, they said that's gotta be fake.
[42:58.000 --> 43:03.480]  Even though it was real Marines, thousands of them, foreign troops, hovercraft, the Coronado,
[43:03.480 --> 43:10.760]  amphibious attack ship, helicopters. You understand mainline conservatives said that can't be real,
[43:10.760 --> 43:12.240]  this guy had $20 million.
[43:12.240 --> 43:18.240]  It all ties together, the bullets, the paper, cut out targets, all of it, it's all coming
[43:18.240 --> 43:22.720]  together. And it's happening a lot faster under Obama, like you said, if it's slowed
[43:22.720 --> 43:28.120]  down under Romney, and it's just in a hyperdrive under Obama. So I appreciate you taking my
[43:28.120 --> 43:29.120]  call there, Mr. James.
[43:29.120 --> 43:34.880]  God bless you, sir, I appreciate your call. And look, I'd be honest, I'll be honest, and
[43:34.880 --> 43:38.760]  I've said this 1,000 times, I'll say it for the thousands at first. If this was a boss
[43:38.760 --> 43:43.840]  hog tyranny, where it was some arrogant boss hog corrupt system and it wanted to own stuff
[43:43.840 --> 43:44.840]  and run things.
[43:44.840 --> 43:52.720]  But the old arrogant type of, I want the country rich and big businesses and big cars and girls
[43:52.720 --> 43:57.640]  in bikinis. I mean, that's kind of the tyranny in the 40s and 50s before the globalists totally
[43:57.640 --> 44:03.280]  took over completely, the technocrats was John Wayne and we're taking over. But that
[44:03.280 --> 44:07.800]  was still a boss hog corruption. I would be saying it was bad and I'd be against it, but
[44:07.800 --> 44:11.840]  I wouldn't be so desperate, like a cat in a box has been thrown in the river trying
[44:11.840 --> 44:15.440]  to scrabble out of it somehow, before I drowned.
[44:15.440 --> 44:21.600]  These globalists are scientists, and they're all into studying. That's why all the internet
[44:21.600 --> 44:26.480]  grid, the surveillance grids, the tracking, it's all about predicting the future. It's
[44:26.480 --> 44:30.800]  all about the elite becoming God. It's all about the elite living forever. Zuckerberg
[44:30.800 --> 44:37.960]  and Brin joined forces to extend life, France 24, announcing new $3 million initiative every
[44:37.960 --> 44:41.020]  year for whoever comes up with life extension technologies.
[44:41.020 --> 44:44.560]  They find these things all the time, you hear about cures for this, cures for that, and
[44:44.560 --> 44:51.040]  they shelve them for the elite. They eat organic, they take clean vaccines, they get purified
[44:51.040 --> 44:56.920]  water, their food's grown in greenhouses, while they kill you. See, the good news is
[44:56.920 --> 44:59.880]  every weapon they release on us, they have to have a cure for.
[44:59.880 --> 45:03.760]  And it's easy to make a weapon, it's hard to have a cure. So see, they're also scared
[45:03.760 --> 45:06.520]  that they might release something on us that'll mutate and get them, that's why they've got
[45:06.520 --> 45:11.320]  the bunkers. But all of this is a Moonraker scenario, but if they're not gonna go to space,
[45:11.320 --> 45:13.080]  they're gonna go underground.
[45:13.080 --> 45:18.880]  That's why Ian Fleming, the big MI6 OSS guy, wrote Moonraker. We guys look up when Ian
[45:18.880 --> 45:24.520]  Fleming had a different name, I think he wrote Moonraker in the 50s, where the elite industrialist
[45:24.520 --> 45:28.760]  release a bio weapon to kill everybody on Earth. But the bio weapon shuts down in one
[45:28.760 --> 45:32.520]  year, so they go off world for one year to kill everybody to create the utopia, that's
[45:32.520 --> 45:34.000]  the plan.
[45:34.000 --> 45:38.880]  See, that isn't a movie, folks, that's their real plan. Just wanna give you a little news
[45:38.880 --> 45:45.520]  flash there. How's your SWAT team uniform matter to you now? And a lot of cops are laughing
[45:45.520 --> 45:49.520]  right now, your child, a lot of you listen, will be diagnosed with cancer. You might wanna
[45:49.520 --> 45:52.520]  go check the cancer numbers after that happens, you're not gonna listen now.
[45:52.520 --> 46:00.920]  Moonraker, 1955, April 5th, Ian Fleming. It's a third novel by British author Ian Fleming,
[46:00.920 --> 46:04.920]  featuring a fictional British Secret Service agent, Commander James Bond. Folks, you better
[46:04.920 --> 46:09.880]  learn about the truth, okay? Not knowing the truth will kill you. We got a chance to beat
[46:09.880 --> 46:16.280]  this, but the enemy has going for him the fact that this is so over the top.
[46:16.280 --> 46:22.840]  It's so over the top that most people just can't get their minds around it. The truth
[46:22.840 --> 46:27.160]  is stranger than fiction. Michael in New York, people come together is what you wanna talk
[46:27.160 --> 46:29.360]  about, go ahead. Or Michelle.
[46:29.360 --> 46:36.840]  Hi, Alex, nice to talk to you. I've been following you for years. I think something really important
[46:36.840 --> 46:41.360]  for everyone to look at, it's a very simple thing. They've been using psychology, these
[46:41.360 --> 46:46.440]  psychopaths against us for years, starting back way before Willie Lynch. And that's why
[46:46.440 --> 46:52.200]  they have us all running now. We don't communicate with one another. And you're Republicans,
[46:52.200 --> 46:59.040]  well, I'm not gonna talk to you, but you know what? We all share the same oppressors. And
[46:59.040 --> 47:03.480]  people may think they have the right answer, and it's hard to tell them you're wrong. But
[47:03.480 --> 47:08.680]  if you tell them, I share the same oppressor as you, and I may not agree with you, but
[47:08.680 --> 47:13.760]  let's talk. We need to break bread, we need to sit down, we need to talk, we need to stop
[47:13.760 --> 47:15.160]  fighting each other.
[47:15.160 --> 47:21.200]  Now, I tend to get frustrated oftentimes with people, but I try to communicate, I try to
[47:21.200 --> 47:25.600]  spread the word and talk. And that's the key, our society, they've got us watching this
[47:25.600 --> 47:30.400]  crap on television. They've got us distracted with cell phones and all this other stuff
[47:30.400 --> 47:31.400]  that's not important.
[47:31.400 --> 47:35.460]  No, it's nothing is allowed to be rolled out and made popular. Some things still squeak
[47:35.460 --> 47:38.240]  out as what they want a world government to clamp down and have full control. They don't
[47:38.240 --> 47:45.240]  have full control yet. That's the good news. The bad news is they've got dominant, systematic
[47:45.240 --> 47:47.680]  programs in that will soon have control.
[47:47.680 --> 47:52.000]  And anything they allow to be rolled out is designed to hurt us, is designed to bring
[47:52.000 --> 47:55.480]  us down. It is a cold blooded total commitment against humanity.
[47:55.480 --> 48:00.800]  Absolutely, I agree completely, I agree completely. And something I try to do is just help other
[48:00.800 --> 48:07.720]  people spread the word and get ready because it's getting worse every day. I've been telling
[48:07.720 --> 48:12.520]  people for years, I worked with youth for many years, and I would tell them and I would
[48:12.520 --> 48:18.720]  say, don't believe me, but don't believe them, do your own research, you know, and it's getting
[48:18.720 --> 48:19.720]  scary.
[48:19.720 --> 48:23.960]  It's getting really scary. I see Bugs Bunny in a soup pot, and the fire's going around
[48:23.960 --> 48:27.520]  them and the vegetables are in and I see most of them there, they're tasting the stuff and
[48:27.520 --> 48:32.240]  saying, ooh, this tastes good. And they need to get out of the stop pot and do something.
[48:32.240 --> 48:37.080]  Now I hear you, good analogy, time to get out of the pot. You're going around cooking
[48:37.080 --> 48:42.000]  us like the Wicked Witch and Hansel and Gretel. I mean, just look at The Globalist, it's the
[48:42.000 --> 48:49.720]  Wicked Witch, folks. They bought $2 million worth of targets of little kids for the police
[48:49.720 --> 48:52.880]  to shoot, and then they defend it.
[48:52.880 --> 48:56.920]  The company defends it and says, well, Homeland Security asked for this. The bullets are for
[48:56.920 --> 49:01.580]  us and it's not just the targets, we have the manuals, we have it all. Wayne in New
[49:01.580 --> 49:03.520]  Jersey, thanks for holding your on the air.
[49:03.520 --> 49:11.040]  How's it going, Alex? You and Joel Skousen do some great work. In reference to the DHS
[49:11.040 --> 49:16.640]  targets, one of your other callers had said that those were the not to shoot targets.
[49:16.640 --> 49:21.480]  No, no, no, no. It says to shoot. It says no hesitation under it. This may be something
[49:21.480 --> 49:22.480]  you face.
[49:22.480 --> 49:27.520]  Right, I understand that. Back in the day, that's what it used to be. They'd put it up
[49:27.520 --> 49:30.480]  in like a Hogan's alley and that would come up.
[49:30.480 --> 49:34.040]  Sure, but do you see how people automatically spin everything? Like first, it can't be a
[49:34.040 --> 49:38.480]  real story. Well then, no, no, you don't shoot the pregnant lady. No, it says non-traditional
[49:38.480 --> 49:43.360]  target depicting a hostile pregnant woman in a nursery.
[49:43.360 --> 49:49.680]  Understand that. It's very dangerous, what they're doing right now.
[49:49.680 --> 49:53.660]  And it says, this is to train you to take out the threat. I mean, it says it in English
[49:53.660 --> 49:56.080]  and people can't believe it.
[49:56.080 --> 50:00.800]  But do you understand what I'm saying? It's a total reversal of what it used to be.
[50:00.800 --> 50:04.800]  No, it's a total reversal. Until four years ago, you never gave a pregnant woman a vaccine.
[50:04.800 --> 50:10.880]  They knew it caused spontaneous miscarriages and the baby lived, it would brain damage
[50:10.880 --> 50:17.400]  them. Now they say, pregnant women need more shots. You understand? They're just seeing
[50:17.400 --> 50:19.040]  what they can get away with.
[50:19.040 --> 50:24.580]  We need a modern day version of Thomas Paine's common sense. That's what we need.
[50:24.580 --> 50:28.860]  We need to realize the enemy runs the government. That doesn't mean everybody in it, but the
[50:28.860 --> 50:35.080]  people running it are super evil. It just needs to be a mass awakening that, my God,
[50:35.080 --> 50:40.220]  we've got a bunch of psych warfare chiefs who are weird, anti-family, anti-human, power
[50:40.220 --> 50:44.440]  tripping nuts who think they're gonna merge with machines and become God in charge.
[50:44.440 --> 50:47.860]  And they're spiking the food and water. And they're killing people all over the world
[50:47.860 --> 50:52.480]  cutting their food off. And they're absolutely out of control. Great points, Wayne. Derek,
[50:52.480 --> 51:01.240]  Michael, Jeremy, everybody else, your calls are coming up. 800-25-99231. I'm Alex Jones.
[51:01.240 --> 51:05.420]  Your freedoms are on the line. The Second Amendment is in danger. How soon before your
[51:05.420 --> 51:10.280]  freedoms are taken away? What can you not live without? What is your greatest dependency?
[51:10.280 --> 51:15.680]  Is it your guns? Is it your home? No, it's food. It all boils down to the food supply.
[51:15.680 --> 51:20.480]  Tyrannical governments control people by controlling their food supply. Don't be dependent. Be
[51:20.480 --> 51:25.200]  self-sufficient. Don't wait for the government to feed you. Feed yourself. I can warn you,

[54:08.920 --> 54:27.760]  All right, I'm gonna continue with your calls in this segment the next, then I'm gonna get
[54:27.760 --> 54:35.200]  into the second American Revolution and what we've got to do to restore the republic. I've
[54:35.200 --> 54:39.880]  got a message to the criminal foreign crime syndicates that run our government. I sit
[54:39.880 --> 54:44.720]  here and I watch and I study what you do every single day. And I watch all the horrible things
[54:44.720 --> 54:48.520]  you do. I know you brag how it's an attribute to be cold blooded and exterminate humans
[54:48.520 --> 54:51.280]  that are a disease on the face of the earth.
[54:51.280 --> 54:55.600]  And I see you selling that idea to the public, so we'll think of ourselves as trash and roll
[54:55.600 --> 55:00.020]  over and die, but that's not gonna happen. I read the book World War Z cuz it's a big
[55:00.020 --> 55:07.600]  Brad Pitt film coming out. The film reportedly is in trouble with re-edits and things.
[55:07.600 --> 55:14.800]  But it's just all about, it was actually great that the zombies came to reduce population.
[55:14.800 --> 55:19.800]  What we needed was a Marxist system. And so it helped bring the UN and the world power
[55:19.800 --> 55:24.640]  that the zombies took over cuz they weren't the real threat. The real threat was the individuals.
[55:24.640 --> 55:32.480]  You're not listening to Mark Hamill of Star Wars, cuz I also listen to the book on tape.
[55:32.480 --> 55:39.880]  In that fake New York accent or East Coast accent, my dad, I didn't listen to him about
[55:39.880 --> 55:44.340]  Marxism, but he was right. And the UN knew how to deal with the American gun owners.
[55:44.340 --> 55:48.640]  We hunted them down. The zombies were our friends. They helped deal with the gun owners
[55:48.640 --> 55:56.640]  as well. I mean, it's every movie, TV show. It's the veterans, the gun owners, they're
[55:56.640 --> 56:04.600]  the enemy. I mean, just see the government is a foreign occupying power, period, period,
[56:04.600 --> 56:06.720]  period.
[56:06.720 --> 56:10.840]  And I know a lot of Americans are gonna follow orders right into the pit of hell, but a lot
[56:10.840 --> 56:14.740]  of us are not gonna do it. So let me just tell all the minions out there, you're not
[56:14.740 --> 56:19.040]  gonna get away with this without one hell of a fight. Just get that through your pea
[56:19.040 --> 56:29.040]  brain. And I don't want to see you cut down. I don't wanna see this engineered civil war
[56:29.040 --> 56:31.080]  they've got all geared up and primed and ready.
[56:31.080 --> 56:35.440]  But they don't have almost every drama and show on TV getting ready for civil war and
[56:35.440 --> 56:39.440]  collapse and at the enemies, the gun owners, because they're gonna play Tiddlywinks. This
[56:39.440 --> 56:44.600]  is a real operational program that they are considering hammering. They got multiple programs
[56:44.600 --> 56:48.600]  going. But right before 9-11, they said, here's Bin Laden. He's gonna get you. What do you
[56:48.600 --> 56:49.600]  do when he attacks?
[56:49.600 --> 56:52.680]  Give your rights up. I saw the pre-programming. It's how I was able to say they were gonna
[56:52.680 --> 56:56.280]  stage an attack. Doesn't mean there aren't Muslim extremists. Doesn't mean Al Qaeda isn't
[56:56.280 --> 57:00.880]  real. The globalist created it. They run it today. Criminal globalist elements infiltrating
[57:00.880 --> 57:05.600]  our government, working with Al Qaeda. Just like FBI doesn't know they work for the globalist.
[57:05.600 --> 57:11.760]  The average Al Qaeda extremist actually thinks they're fighting for Allah.
[57:11.760 --> 57:16.800]  It's compartmentalization where the globalists run all the sides. Do you understand that?
[57:16.800 --> 57:21.360]  If you don't get that, it's over. I'm gonna go to break. I'm gonna come back with some
[57:21.360 --> 57:29.640]  of your phone calls. Don't forget our broadcast is listener supported when you buy the books,

[57:45.200 --> 57:50.200]  21. A noble lie to understand false flag terror and Clinton's involvement and the Attorney
[57:50.200 --> 57:51.200]  General's involvement.
[57:51.200 --> 57:55.320]  He was deputy attorney general at the time. To wake Christians up that the tribulation

[01:00:25.260 --> 01:00:30.060]  success of this transmission is that more and more were able to shape the debate. It's
[01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:36.100]  an incredible responsibility, and I want to say I'm thankful for it, but quite frankly,
[01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:41.020]  didn't even want this job. That's why I've been successful. I got involved in this because
[01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:45.420]  I believed in liberty and didn't want to live under slavery. I didn't get involved in media
[01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:51.780]  like most people to be a big shot. I got involved in media and crawled my way up to this point

[01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:03.380]  the second American Revolution. Will it be peaceful? Will it be violent? How do we turn
[01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:04.960]  this republic around?
[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:08.300]  The most weighty of subjects will be carried and covered in the next segment. Let's go
[01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:16.180]  to phone calls right now. Let's go to Scotty in Iowa. Scotty in Iowa, you're on the air.
[01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:17.180]  Thanks for holding.
[01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:24.260]  Hi, I wanted to ask you guys' opinion on my, I have some family members who are in the
[01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:28.580]  military, they're in the army. And they were saying how Obama's making this new rule that
[01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:35.380]  if the enemy does not have a weapon in their hand, you can't shoot them. And one of my
[01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:41.780]  cousins had one of his men get stabbed, I shouldn't say stabbed, the enemy had a machete
[01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:43.260]  and hit him in the head.
[01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:48.340]  Yeah, well that's all part of PR. Obama will say I'm anti-war, give me a peace prize. You
[01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:52.380]  know, you've got to put pink hearts on the sides of the bullets before you fire them
[01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:56.980]  while he has drones blowing up whole buildings and saying it's collateral damage to kill
[01:01:56.980 --> 01:02:02.740]  200 people and only kill one bad guy, they claim. So that's all just PR baloney. And
[01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:06.300]  they're just getting ready to politically correct the military, put women in front line
[01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:12.660]  combat, pulling crosses out of the chapels, cuz they want to phase it out in the next
[01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:13.660]  decade.
[01:02:13.660 --> 01:02:16.880]  They're gonna go purely to robots. And then you'll just have people literally in pink
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:22.740]  outfits prancing around there to back up the robots at the attack factories and the mobile.
[01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:27.980]  But they plan to have these giant floating fortresses that are the size of like 10 giant
[01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:34.300]  oil drilling refineries or oil drilling platforms. This is an official plan, floating fortresses
[01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:39.980]  directly out of 1984. Guys, look up Pentagon plans and NATO plans, giant floating fortresses.
[01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:44.300]  And then they're gonna have robot repair factories on those with big robot Ospreys and other
[01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:48.740]  attack craft that take off, and then you'll have supply ships at these giant floating
[01:02:48.740 --> 01:02:50.400]  robot attack systems.
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:54.340]  So don't worry, the whole spree decor, humans are out of it. Humans won't be working at
[01:02:54.340 --> 01:02:58.780]  McDonald's, they won't be working in factories, they won't be working in the military. You'll
[01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:03.860]  have technicians that back up the robots in case they have problems. But already top engineers
[01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:06.860]  don't even know how the computers work, and none of them can even tell how they all go
[01:03:06.860 --> 01:03:07.860]  together now.
[01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:12.180]  And the algorithms are all out of control. So you'll just basically have computers working
[01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:16.900]  on the computers. And at that point, the globalists are gonna release the bioweapon. Just get
[01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:19.380]  rid of us, we're not needed anymore. They officially say they're gonna kill us. What
[01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:20.380]  do you think about that?
[01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:27.420]  That's insane. Another thing that I had a question on is some of my family members think
[01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:32.060]  that what Obama's doing is he's sending out some of our troops little by little, and that
[01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:33.380]  he's creating his own army?
[01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:39.340]  No, no, no, they're creating their own. Well, there will be combat troops in each nation
[01:03:39.340 --> 01:03:44.540]  because it's fun to torture and kill people. So the Soviets will all have their own uniforms.
[01:03:44.540 --> 01:03:49.860]  The new neo-Soviet banker minion will all have their uniforms and have their purges
[01:03:49.860 --> 01:03:55.600]  and rape our wives and stomp on us and kick our brains out and torture us and all that.
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:59.200]  So yeah, no, they're all fantasizing about federal militias and how they're gonna take
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:04.600]  all our property and our families and conscript our children into forced labor. So yes, that
[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:07.820]  is going on, their own domestic security force, yes.
[01:04:07.820 --> 01:04:10.620]  Okay, that's just what my main question was.
[01:04:10.620 --> 01:04:17.620]  No, that's official, that's their plan, yeah. I mean, the heirs were in the meetings, came
[01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:21.140]  out and then the core people went to jail over and they said, we're gonna put 50 million
[01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:24.820]  libertarians and conservatives in camps, we're gonna kill at least half of them.
[01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:29.740]  And that was back when our population was 200 million. Back in the 70s, it's now 315
[01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:34.860]  million. So you gotta look at them killing about 80 million people. Or no, putting 80
[01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:40.180]  million in reeducation camps, which are really just big party houses for psychopaths. See,
[01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:44.700]  psychopaths have their biggest, kinda like chili cook-offs when they have a big government.
[01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:49.540]  Psychopaths, the smart ones, build a big government cuz they can kill and steal on the way up.
[01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:53.620]  But then they have a big blood party at the end of it, like Hitler and Lenin and Stalin
[01:04:53.620 --> 01:05:00.460]  and Mao had. And Mao killed 65 to 85 million, no one really knows. It's just all a big party.

[01:07:02.460 --> 01:07:07.140]  of research into why, even if I had a pretty good sized meal, that I was still starving
[01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:12.060]  and my research led me to a well known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops
[01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:16.220]  on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[01:07:16.220 --> 01:07:21.900]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to
[01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:27.660]  rebuild themselves, fight off cancer and be healthy. I then searched out the best vitamin
[01:07:27.660 --> 01:07:32.580]  and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity. The Young Jevity products are

[01:08:59.780 --> 01:09:05.460]  Okay, coming up I'll get to more of your calls. Jeremy and Jason and John and Sean and Charles
[01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:10.460]  and everyone that is patiently holding. And I'm gonna get into John Kerry, the new Secretary
[01:09:10.460 --> 01:09:14.560]  of State's first initiative. He has the global carbon tax and shutting down what's left of
[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:15.560]  American industry.
[01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:21.880]  We're gonna be getting to that. We're also gonna be looking at the economy in depth and
[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:27.180]  how they're trying to hide inflation with horse meat and fake fish and the rest of it,
[01:09:27.180 --> 01:09:34.100]  that new scandal breaking as well. I also want to look at life extension technologies
[01:09:34.100 --> 01:09:37.020]  that the globalists have been suppressing.
[01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:43.660]  That's just some of what we're going to be covering here today. But if you remember a
[01:09:43.660 --> 01:09:58.260]  few weeks after Obama was reelected, I made the call for a second American revolution.
[01:09:58.260 --> 01:10:03.540]  I made the call for a second American revolution, but I was very clear that via the Declaration
[01:10:03.540 --> 01:10:14.980]  of Independence, and to quote our founding documents, July 4, 1776, in the Continental
[01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:19.580]  Congress, that it is our right and our duty to throw off an oppressive government that
[01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:26.700]  becomes destructive of the basic aims of life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, due process,
[01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:29.220]  private property, things like that.
[01:10:29.220 --> 01:10:35.300]  And if you look at the long train of abuses, that's exactly what we're facing today by
[01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:44.420]  an order of magnitude, conservatively. And America is a conquered country. Foreign globalist
[01:10:44.420 --> 01:10:49.740]  interests brag, I wrote an article a few months ago with Paul Watson. It's a very important
[01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:54.580]  article titled Banksters Declare They've Conquered the United States and Europe.
[01:10:54.580 --> 01:11:01.860]  And it's got more than 15, 16 different videos and links to world leaders saying, the New
[01:11:01.860 --> 01:11:05.580]  World Order is run by private banks, we've conquered you. And they're not free market.
[01:11:05.580 --> 01:11:09.860]  They didn't buy the world. They took over the world by paying off politicians and then
[01:11:09.860 --> 01:11:15.940]  having them sign us onto their debt. And only Iceland has said no and kicked the banksters
[01:11:15.940 --> 01:11:20.040]  out and actually arrested their bankers who were involved in the fraud.
[01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:25.880]  That's the only course. Now to understand the fact that there is a solution and there
[01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:33.020]  is a way to beat these people, you need to first look at the enemy's attack profile.
[01:11:33.020 --> 01:11:38.280]  What is the New World Order global corporate mafia based in Europe, England and the United
[01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:44.940]  States, dominating most of the world, paying off most of the Russians in a power sharing
[01:11:44.940 --> 01:11:53.620]  deal with the communist Chinese under a eugenics agreement, agreed on in 1949 that Mao would
[01:11:53.620 --> 01:11:59.340]  kill a large portion of his population, later codified under one child in 1975 with Ambassador
[01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:02.080]  Bush.
[01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:06.580]  Now under that power axis, they're mopping up a few Arab countries. They're mopping up
[01:12:06.580 --> 01:12:14.020]  a few Eastern European countries, a few African countries. They're mopping up here and there.
[01:12:14.020 --> 01:12:20.660]  But the whole world points out, hey, the big funder of the empire, the big once wealthy
[01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:28.760]  republic. You still got your guns, you still got some private property. You've got a federal
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:34.140]  tax of around 40% when it's a 75% or more in France.
[01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:42.820]  That's the model and Obama's hired not one but two socialist, globalist, French economists
[01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:47.620]  to come over here and run things. You saw that a few months ago. They're saying under
[01:12:47.620 --> 01:12:54.500]  the OECD, that's the real global banking receivership arm that they use to bring Europe under receivership
[01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:59.860]  during the Marshall Plan that is the Organization of Economic and Cooperative Development via
[01:12:59.860 --> 01:13:07.260]  the Ex-Im Bank, IMF and World Bank through the local consortiums, Bank of England, Private
[01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:17.180]  Federal Reserve and other systems. They are here to bankrupt the world system and to end
[01:13:17.180 --> 01:13:20.360]  the family, to make you so poor you can't afford to have children.
[01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:25.220]  And wherever you're poor, you're not gonna be allowed to have children. And they've actually
[01:13:25.220 --> 01:13:31.100]  paid the welfare system to create a giant horde of disenfranchised, dumbed down, fluoride
[01:13:31.100 --> 01:13:36.780]  heads to actually be their weapon system. See, the eugenics is a balanced system. It's
[01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:43.860]  an algorithm to exterminate a certain number of the undesirables, while also producing
[01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:50.220]  another group that will form the basis of your takeover army against your real enemy,
[01:13:50.220 --> 01:14:00.260]  the middle class, i.e., high IQ, genetic groups which can come from any so-called race, that
[01:14:00.260 --> 01:14:07.980]  in their structure algorithm studies would form a threat to the overall in-game takeover
[01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:08.980]  scenario.
[01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:14.300]  Now, when I start to get into all this, it gets very technical, and I'm going off schematics
[01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:18.860]  in my mind. And of course, I've made a film on it almost seven years ago, in-game, Blueprint
[01:14:18.860 --> 01:14:24.940]  for Global Enslavement. But I can get lost in the minutia. Let me just reset and put
[01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:32.700]  it to you this way. There's a global corporate empire who doesn't just wanna conquer you.
[01:14:32.700 --> 01:14:44.980]  Once it's in place, it is a scientific technocracy following a mindset based on Malthusian systems
[01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:53.300]  of exterminism, or what would be called in modern terminology, a universal ultra-Hitlerian
[01:14:53.300 --> 01:15:00.260]  program of mass genocide against over 90% of the world's population.
[01:15:00.260 --> 01:15:07.020]  Now, we face that. That's their game plan. And they want control of the resources and
[01:15:07.020 --> 01:15:13.740]  control of the society to be able to carry that program out. And to do that, they've
[01:15:13.740 --> 01:15:22.220]  also dumbed the population down, created artificial arrested development. They have poisoned culturally,
[01:15:22.220 --> 01:15:29.700]  spiritually, but also physically the general population, as Thomas Robert Malthus called
[01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:32.820]  for.
[01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:38.540]  In what about the year 1800, roughly, was when he put out one of his major thesis. 1898
[01:15:38.540 --> 01:15:44.300]  was the first publishing date of that, the essay on the principle of population. And
[01:15:44.300 --> 01:15:51.460]  he said, poison them, release bio-weapons on them, dumb them down. He said, ship them
[01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:54.220]  to the colonies for slave labor.
[01:15:54.220 --> 01:16:02.020]  In fact, there's famous British Army Colonel manuals that are in the Smithsonian where
[01:16:02.020 --> 01:16:07.660]  they talk about how to incubate the smallpox, how to pop the sores properly, how to lay
[01:16:07.660 --> 01:16:11.860]  on the blankets and then quickly, cuz it's fresher that way and has a better kill ratio,
[01:16:11.860 --> 01:16:13.140]  give that to the Indians.
[01:16:13.140 --> 01:16:19.860]  You see, that's 200 plus years ago. They give you vaccines today that kill you 20 years
[01:16:19.860 --> 01:16:27.460]  down the road. And again, I know this is so nightmarish. I mean, I know it's crazy, but
[01:16:27.460 --> 01:16:32.700]  it's real. I mean, it's what you find when you go study the real history. And there is
[01:16:32.700 --> 01:16:35.380]  no return from this unless we wake up to it.
[01:16:35.380 --> 01:16:39.500]  There's no future for our children. There's no future for anybody. And I wanna warn those
[01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:44.220]  of you out there who serve the establishment on the so-called right and left, who think
[01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:47.740]  that you're just gonna go quietly into the night and that you're gonna be part of the
[01:16:47.740 --> 01:16:55.100]  winning team. There could be two exterminist, anti-human haters. There could be two high
[01:16:55.100 --> 01:17:00.940]  priests to the New World Order together in a high mountain temple when they've exterminated
[01:17:00.940 --> 01:17:02.540]  the entire world population.
[01:17:02.540 --> 01:17:07.700]  If there was two of them, two biomechanical monsters, cuz that's what they believe they're
[01:17:07.700 --> 01:17:18.180]  gonna turn into. Standing at the ultimate pinnacle of exterminist, nihilistic, flagellation,
[01:17:18.180 --> 01:17:25.460]  they would kill each other. So I know where this leads historically. I know where this
[01:17:25.460 --> 01:17:27.620]  leads spiritually.
[01:17:27.620 --> 01:17:32.460]  I know where this leads physically. I know where this leads intellectually, but in my
[01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:39.620]  gut and in my spirit and every level, there is no turning back for many of you I know.
[01:17:39.620 --> 01:17:44.320]  But for many of you who are compartmentalized, you're listening right now and you know what
[01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:49.240]  I'm saying is true, not because you know I've done my research, but because you're part
[01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:50.240]  of it.
[01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:55.100]  I think that right now the question is, do we all work for central bankers? That's what
[01:17:55.100 --> 01:18:00.180]  I wanna address to our guests tonight. Is this global governance at last? Is it one
[01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:06.340]  world the central bankers in charge? Jim Iorio, you say we've got some downside here, a correction
[01:18:06.340 --> 01:18:07.980]  in the markets, fine.
[01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:12.580]  But aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do? Aren't we all just
[01:18:12.580 --> 01:18:17.580]  counting on the fact that there's a Bernanke putt and that we won't go any lower than say
[01:18:17.580 --> 01:18:19.980]  5% down from here?
[01:18:19.980 --> 01:18:22.240]  Of course we are because of-
[01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:26.300]  And then the rest of them go through the fact that they agree with him. Yeah, the fellow
[01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:31.440]  is our master, but it doesn't matter, they're in control, that's the way it is. And that's
[01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:38.660]  like the alien spacecraft arriving at Earth and your television sets go, I am Gorgon.
[01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:43.320]  We have come to capture your planet, we will destroy your planet as we've done countless
[01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:48.720]  others if you do not submit immediately to us.
[01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:53.200]  And they're all over the news announcing we're slaves, while having dramas and sitcoms and
[01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:59.540]  movies and police training manuals where they tell you this doesn't exist, the banking takeover
[01:18:59.540 --> 01:19:05.960]  doesn't exist. Terrorists say it exists and they're gonna blow stuff up. No, the globalists
[01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:11.100]  are gonna blow stuff up and then try to come arrest all of us.
[01:19:11.100 --> 01:19:17.020]  So when we come back, I'll break down just some of my thoughts and ideas, talking points
[01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:24.560]  from my research in history of how we can really kickstart a resistance before it gets
[01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:32.240]  physical and really cause a real cultural revolution, a cultural seismic awakening.
[01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:36.960]  And it either happens that way explosively or it doesn't happen. The globalists know
[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:42.200]  how easily this can happen. All we have to do is speak to the human instinct of survival
[01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:47.200]  that beats in the hearts and the minds of most of the minions of the system who are
[01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:49.200]  gonna be destroyed as well.
[01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:53.440]  We just have to get the message out and it's game over. We've beaten the tyrants countless
[01:19:53.440 --> 01:20:00.680]  times before. We'll beat them this time again if God is with us.

[01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:05.120]  Hey everybody, Ty Bollinger here. Once again, real life, real stories.
[01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:09.960]  And he discovered Carnivora, was so thrilled with the product that he shared it with his
[01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:14.160]  family and his friends and his patients. My dad was a family physician, he was a medical
[01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:19.200]  doctor. Almost all the symptoms were either diminished or gone. Amazing product, amazing
[01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:25.440]  results. It's like an amazing thing having such a profound change in how I feel and knowing
[01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:30.400]  that it was the Carnivora that did it. And a lot of patients got better ranging from
[01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:35.440]  immune dysfunction to allergies and infection. Here's the toll free telephone number to call

[01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:34.080]  We the people grow cotton, we fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from
[01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:38.320]  counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having it lead back at interest, forcing taxes
[01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:42.460]  to service debt. This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing
[01:22:42.460 --> 01:22:45.920]  the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing
[01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:49.200]  army? Hi, Ted Anderson. I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our
[01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:55.080]  monetary system. Call for your copy. 800-686-2237. It's time to understand the system. Call
[01:22:55.080 --> 01:23:04.040]  800-686-2237. That's 800-686-2237. Hey there. Frank Bates here. Have you heard
[01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:09.800]  about the weird device that could wipe out 280 million Americans? This is really scary
[01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:15.000]  stuff. Defense experts warn that this odd device poses the gravest threat we've ever
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:19.660]  known. In fact, just a few weeks ago, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an
[01:23:19.660 --> 01:23:24.320]  op-ed piece for the Washington Post warning about this deadly threat. I can't believe
[01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:28.680]  that more people aren't talking about this. It may be because the liberals and the government
[01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:34.920]  are trying to cover it up. That's why my friend just created a free video at weirddevice.com
[01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:39.880]  that exposes this threat and blows the doors off the conspiracy. Go watch the shocking
[01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:45.860]  video at weirddevice.com right now to discover exactly what it is, plus discover the number
[01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:50.840]  one way you and your family can survive this deadly attack. I'm not sure how long this
[01:23:50.840 --> 01:23:57.840]  video will be online, so go to weirddevice.com before it's gone forever. Again, that's weirddevice.com.
[01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:27.880]  So they've gone for 50 years saying, the John Birch Society, the lying demons, because it
[01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:33.680]  was only the John Birch Society in the 50s and 60s that was even covering any of this.
[01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:37.940]  And so they would go, those crazy conspiracy theorists who they say our government put
[01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:46.940]  Mao in, all been declassified in the mid 90s. CIA putting in 1949 declassified, go look
[01:24:46.940 --> 01:24:52.600]  it up. Biggest mass murder in history, one in communism. Nixon was just making public
[01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:57.240]  a deal that was already done. And that isn't America. Pundits will then say, how dare you
[01:24:57.240 --> 01:25:02.680]  say America runs the commies. Criminal mega banks run the commies.
[01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:07.760]  Read Tragedy and Hope, written by Carol Quigley, Bill Clinton's mentor, who he cried in a speech
[01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:14.520]  and thanked as the man that taught him everything. His CIA handler, when he was in the CIA and
[01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:20.200]  sent over to England with Hillary, that's been CIA from the beginning. By the way, that's
[01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:21.200]  documented.
[01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:25.960]  It's just the general public. Did you know Anderson Cooper's admittedly CIA? And what
[01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:33.320]  is he, an aster? The point is, it's the same Vanderbilt. Yeah, the other one's an aster,
[01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:44.200]  the Daily Caller guy. The point is, is that there's never an end to any of this. All right,
[01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:50.440]  and a bunch of rich people wanna sic the giant dumbed down mass on the middle class.
[01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:57.480]  So they plan a massive takeover in this country. Now, the solution to beat these people is
[01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:04.360]  in their defense strategy. What are they organized around? They're organized in the John Warner
[01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:09.800]  Defense Authorization Act before Obama got in for state insurrection even by legislatures.
[01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:16.400]  It talks about legislatures and governors and state insurrection. We're talking Civil
[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:21.040]  War stuff. You notice they billed Obama as he'll be the Lincoln. They knew people were
[01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:24.280]  gonna resist this. He'll crush the states.
[01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:27.880]  If you don't like turning your guns in, you're a racist. You're the Confederates. You're
[01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:31.440]  like, what's it have to do with that? If you don't like socialism, you're a Confederate.
[01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:39.120]  You're a white Southerner, Rangel says. Al Sharpton says. All the MSNBC pundits, Rachel
[01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:45.040]  Maddow, Slimeball, Matthews, all of them. You're like, doesn't make sense. No, it does.
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:49.040]  The globalists are gonna blow stuff up and say the new Confederates did it. How did I
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:53.720]  know all this was coming? I was seeing Army War College stuff five years ago before Obama.
[01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:56.720]  They were getting ready though. They were putting these out to the troops and put them
[01:26:56.720 --> 01:26:58.280]  out of the officer corps.
[01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:03.000]  So I see them getting the next war ready. And they do synthetic wars. They make them
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:07.760]  up. They run all the sides. So I see them getting it all ready. And I'm like, hey, the
[01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:12.960]  plan is they're gonna say he's Lincoln. They're gonna start a civil war. And so the entire
[01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:17.800]  program is set up, though, to where they'll artificially represent the states and call
[01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:20.160]  it Confederate.
[01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:23.960]  When the states of the Declaration of Independence and the people can reconstitute the government
[01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:28.480]  whenever they want. They wanna bill it federal government against the states and the evil
[01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:33.520]  whites. That's the new targets, the bullet training, the manuals. They wanna false bill
[01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:38.200]  it. It's us minorities in a loving socialist government against the evil white right-wingers.
[01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:42.680]  Kill anybody in a John Deere hat. Let's get them, yeah!
[01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:51.660]  Okay, now, they want to push that false idea instead of people like Sheriff Clark, who's
[01:27:51.660 --> 01:27:58.800]  black and super smart and well-spoken, has a hero background. And along with 400 other
[01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:02.600]  sheriffs now saying this is gonna cause a revolution. We're gonna be with the people
[01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:04.440]  that totally freaks the system out.
[01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:09.900]  In fact, if I was the globalist, this is the type of person I'd go after is Clark and other
[01:28:09.900 --> 01:28:16.760]  sheriffs like Mack. But the fact that he's black and talks like George Washington absolutely
[01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:22.880]  is like kryptonite to these people, all right? Of course, that's an analogy of a good guy.
[01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:27.600]  What's something that takes out water to the witch in The Wizard of Oz, okay? He's like
[01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:32.400]  water to the witch. I'm melting, I'm melting. So they wanna have this balkanization, have
[01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:33.400]  this division.
[01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:37.320]  That's why it's so cartoonish you turn on any drama or show. Yeah, the whites are murdering
[01:28:37.320 --> 01:28:40.760]  killers and all veterans that are white are terrorists and McGarrett's gonna take out
[01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:45.680]  the evil white person. Next show, yeah, crazy terrorists just blew stuff up. He thinks they're
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:49.820]  spraying stuff on us. Next show, yeah, the founding fathers were killers and racist filth
[01:28:49.820 --> 01:28:50.820]  had to be dealt with.
[01:28:50.820 --> 01:28:54.300]  Next channel, yeah, those that don't like socialism are actually enemies and planning
[01:28:54.300 --> 01:28:57.960]  to hurt children. Next channel, yeah, the mother didn't take vaccines. We took her kids
[01:28:57.960 --> 01:29:03.400]  for abuse. It's abuse to not take shots. Next channel, fluoride's good for your children.
[01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:07.920]  Everyone knows it, so is aspartame. Only extremists that are child molesters are against it. Next
[01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:13.840]  channel, the lights are off cuz the rebels blow the power plant up.
[01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:20.200]  See, if you're awake, it's cartoonish. But see, the general public watches that. They
[01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:24.640]  go to work, they go home, they watch TV. That's their matrix, that's their bubble. So when
[01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:28.120]  I come back, I'm gonna tell you how to beat these people, okay? I'm gonna tell you how
[01:29:28.120 --> 01:29:29.120]  to beat them.
[01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:35.560]  Because in their defense strategy, you see where they're weak, you understand? You understand?
[01:29:35.560 --> 01:29:41.120]  And I'm gonna tell you, you beat them at one level, I'll tell you when we come back. I
[01:29:41.120 --> 01:29:46.480]  mean, the thing is, if you knew what I knew, which isn't hard to know, if you understood
[01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:50.040]  my mind and understood the history, we could defeat them very quickly.
[01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:57.040]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:31:12.260 --> 01:31:16.800]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states
[01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:22.380]  on Earth. This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps
[01:31:22.380 --> 01:31:27.840]  now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program
[01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:30.800]  has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:35.400]  Police state four chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen. Prepare
[01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:40.960]  to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship, body scammers, sound cannons,
[01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:45.920]  citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner. It's only the beginning
[01:31:45.920 --> 01:31:48.600]  of the New World Order's hellish plan.

[01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:24.240]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:34.200]  he. Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:40.980]  Kind of get out of brainstorm mode here and try to just nail this down calmly. And a lot
[01:33:40.980 --> 01:33:46.520]  of it I've already said before, but we can defeat the globalist if we know who they are
[01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:51.600]  and how bad they are and really get people out of their trance to realize that they can't
[01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:54.560]  be spectators any longer.
[01:33:54.560 --> 01:34:00.760]  And as this system gets more and more abusive, even decadent slobs will start to wake up
[01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:08.620]  and try to do something. But the biggest issue here is teaching people they do have power.
[01:34:08.620 --> 01:34:14.840]  Doing little things against the system, telling people about this radio broadcast, telling
[01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:19.040]  people about books and films that expose the New World Order, running for political office
[01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:24.440]  even if you lose, educating people where you spend your money, what you support, growing
[01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:29.400]  a garden, buying local, getting healthy and none of us are perfect.
[01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:37.080]  It's just moving in the right direction. Big things have small beginnings. Now, that said,
[01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:40.480]  how do we defeat this? Well, first off, we see the globalists want to divide and conquer
[01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:45.720]  everybody. And we see they want to get rid of borders and bring in globalism to replace
[01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:50.440]  our republic. So basically, anything the globalists are for, we need to be against.
[01:34:50.440 --> 01:34:55.600]  If they're for taking guns, there are intellectual arguments for guns, obviously. But we just
[01:34:55.600 --> 01:35:00.440]  know to be against gun control because the globalists are tyrants and want to take our
[01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:06.680]  guns to enslave us. So I don't debate or argue with them. That's why I didn't debate. I debated
[01:35:06.680 --> 01:35:10.180]  too much. I should have debated even less with Piers Morgan, because he's not there
[01:35:10.180 --> 01:35:11.180]  to debate.
[01:35:11.180 --> 01:35:16.520]  He's a hatchet man. He's there to try to sell the disarmament and enslavement of our people,
[01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:20.400]  no matter what color they are. And we've got to come together for the real Bill of Rights
[01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:26.320]  and Constitution, the real civil rights, the real God-given rights, the real human rights
[01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:28.920]  of liberty and freedom.
[01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:33.040]  Not the right of a woman or the right of being black or the right of being Hispanic or the
[01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:38.760]  right of being an evil white person, which they see is the main middle class that's left
[01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:44.640]  to be taken down. And we've got to discredit the system like our lives depend on it, because
[01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:53.680]  it does. It does depend on it. Now, that said, the way to defeat the globalist is a rediscovery
[01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:57.660]  of the Declaration of Independence, that it is our right and our duty to throw off oppressive
[01:35:57.660 --> 01:35:58.660]  bonds.
[01:35:58.660 --> 01:36:02.760]  And that we are the sovereigns and that we are the officials and that we are the authority
[01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:07.880]  and that the government people are our servants. And that corporations buying off government
[01:36:07.880 --> 01:36:13.560]  to just raise taxes arbitrarily or fines or fees or shut down power plants, that that's
[01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:18.760]  illegal. That the establishment can't just sell off utilities for pennies on the dollar
[01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:22.860]  to their friends, that's not privatization, that's piracy.
[01:36:22.860 --> 01:36:32.680]  But all that aside, this is the gist of it, the key. In their defeat, finding the way
[01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:38.680]  to defeat them is to look where they're most defensive. Because where is the rightful remedy?
[01:36:38.680 --> 01:36:44.460]  States rights, 10th Amendment nullification, bringing the Congress and the federal government
[01:36:44.460 --> 01:36:45.460]  under control.
[01:36:45.460 --> 01:36:49.200]  But you're only going to do that when you realize it's fully captured. It doesn't listen
[01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:56.040]  to reason, it doesn't find the truth, it doesn't get religion, it doesn't come to Jesus. Because
[01:36:56.040 --> 01:37:02.840]  it's a fully held pillbox full of foreign soldiers, full of global technocrats. We're
[01:37:02.840 --> 01:37:05.200]  designed to fight a foreign enemy in a uniform.
[01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:12.160]  These are bought off agents of globalist who are totally ruthless, and whose tool of control
[01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:20.400]  is to make you poor while consolidating and stealing your wealth. So we as a people, first
[01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:23.920]  have to realize that, and then we have to realize what are they worried about?
[01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:29.500]  States rights, the family, the individual, races of people coming together around the
[01:37:29.500 --> 01:37:35.280]  Bill of Rights and Constitution as a human race for liberty. They're afraid of being
[01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:42.800]  independent, they're afraid of private wealth. They're afraid of freedom because they're
[01:37:42.800 --> 01:37:48.660]  flaming authoritarians. So once you realize that, you look at how they're set up saying
[01:37:48.660 --> 01:37:50.280]  states have no rights ever.
[01:37:50.280 --> 01:37:55.140]  Well, why do we have states? We know that's a fraud. How in 1913, they took the senators
[01:37:55.140 --> 01:38:00.560]  from the states who were elected by the legislature. Senators were pure creatures of the state,
[01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:07.820]  giving the states the veto power over government. That's the real system, separation of powers.
[01:38:07.820 --> 01:38:14.240]  And so we move for states rights. We move for sovereignty of America and expose the
[01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:18.240]  fact that we're under globalism. We expose the fact the federal government's been captured
[01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:20.280]  and those serving them are collaborators.
[01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:24.560]  That's not rhetoric, folks. Like I'm saying, it's like they're foreign collaborators. They
[01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:31.500]  are. Get that through your head, get that out to everyone, okay? And then we realize
[01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:34.800]  that's why they demonize states rights. That's why they demonize gun owners. That's why they
[01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:38.500]  demonize because they've got things planned so horrible.
[01:38:38.500 --> 01:38:43.440]  They know people are gonna get out of their coma and finally physically resist. And the
[01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:47.480]  government and the foreign bankers know they have no other choice. They're all gonna go
[01:38:47.480 --> 01:38:52.440]  to jail unless they bring in a total tyranny and arrest their opposition, those of us aware
[01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:59.360]  of their criminal takeover. So see, they're committed 100% to their cause.
[01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:04.160]  But if you really look at it strategically, militarily, culturally, historically, it's
[01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:10.360]  so over the top to have a foreign occupier. And foreign occupiers always get run out if
[01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:14.400]  the people have the will to fight. So why don't we politically fight and culturally
[01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:16.660]  fight ahead of a physical fight?
[01:39:16.660 --> 01:39:19.700]  Because even though there's a good chance they'll lose that, that's what they wanna
[01:39:19.700 --> 01:39:27.400]  go to because they can see long term they're losing the hearts and minds of the people.
[01:39:27.400 --> 01:39:32.060]  So their entire defense structure is around stopping the rightful remedy in the Constitution
[01:39:32.060 --> 01:39:37.440]  Bill of Rights Declaration of Independence of state sovereignty, individual sovereignty,
[01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:42.320]  Bill of Rights Constitution that's duplicated in the 50 states.
[01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:47.400]  In case the head gets taken over, there are 50 other systems that can join together or
[01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:57.480]  separately lead the way out of the takeover. It's designed like ships that have their own
[01:39:57.480 --> 01:40:02.720]  air tanks in them. So they're flooding, they just pump up the air tanks or boats that can't
[01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:04.600]  be sunk that have styrofoam in them.
[01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:08.680]  But the globalists are in there like termites trying to eat out the styrofoam to sink us.
[01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:13.160]  You understand that? Well, we just need to bail. When you resist the globalists, when
[01:40:13.160 --> 01:40:17.600]  you criticize the UN, when you fight for sovereignty, when you go and get involved politically,
[01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:18.600]  when you speak out.
[01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:24.200]  Look at Obama trying to rally all his idiot minions to go after guns and say, I need your
[01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:29.820]  horrible stories of what happened to you to personalize it. One man's a tragedy, a million's
[01:40:29.820 --> 01:40:36.080]  a statistic as Stalin said. Because it's a culture war, and he's trying to rally the
[01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:41.920]  useful idiots he's sucking dry and abusing and destroying and all the poor he's creating
[01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:44.760]  cuz he's their front man.
[01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:50.000]  We need to rally everybody. You need to realize how important you are in this fight. But here's
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:54.360]  the key, I always build up to it. Cuz there's hundreds of little points I wanna make, but
[01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:59.840]  the big central one is this. State sovereignty, a second American Revolution, because that's
[01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:02.960]  a catching term and that's what it is.
[01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:07.720]  But not a Soviet Cultural Revolution, not a fascist Cultural Revolution, an American
[01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:14.160]  Republic, born again revolution of mind. That's where it all starts first, 90% of war is end
[01:41:14.160 --> 01:41:23.320]  for war. And we take that revolution of mind, and we inject that revolution out there with
[01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:27.540]  the pride and the dignity and the focus that we have knowing we're in the right.
[01:41:27.540 --> 01:41:31.560]  And not caring if we're criticized, not caring if people are brainwashed and laugh at us,
[01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:37.600]  they're victims. And we explain that the system is demonizing states' rights, gun owners,
[01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:45.440]  constitutionalists, and trying to typecast it as WWE star Jack Swagger in a staged arrest
[01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:49.640]  demonizing Alex Jones.
[01:41:49.640 --> 01:41:55.720]  They're doing all of that because they know that is the way out of all of this. And so
[01:41:55.720 --> 01:42:01.560]  they wanna make Hispanics, blacks, Northern whites, whoever, think, well, you're not part
[01:42:01.560 --> 01:42:05.840]  of America, even though it started in the North. You're not part of 1776, even though
[01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:07.920]  you live in Boston or New York.
[01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:11.600]  You don't know your history, you're not taught your history. No, it's those evil Southerners,
[01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:19.840]  they wanna keep the guns cuz they're racist. The big delicious punch bowl of the Republic
[01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:24.520]  that everybody would wanna drink out of, and what's Chris Matthews and Al Sharpton doing?
[01:42:24.520 --> 01:42:32.240]  They are bent over using the restroom in the punch bowl so that people won't go drink out
[01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:36.800]  of it, but that's not the real punch bowl. You understand that? And so we just simply
[01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:41.900]  have to point out, they're desperately demonizing things because that's where they're weak.
[01:42:41.900 --> 01:42:45.640]  That's where they can be defeated, that they're occupiers, that they're liars, that they're
[01:42:45.640 --> 01:42:50.680]  frauds, that they have tiny audiences now, they're imploding. That's why they claim Obama
[01:42:50.680 --> 01:42:57.440]  was a mandate, Obama has won, everyone wants socialism and to turn their guns in and to
[01:42:57.440 --> 01:43:03.160]  have open borders. They have the Crossroads Group and hundreds of millions of Republican
[01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:08.920]  dollars and Karl Rove leading it, demonizing even mainline conservatives like Glenn Beck
[01:43:08.920 --> 01:43:14.280]  and Rush Limbaugh.
[01:43:14.280 --> 01:43:18.720]  Because they saw all those Tea Party people get elected and all those Campaign for Liberty
[01:43:18.720 --> 01:43:22.880]  people get elected, a whole bunch. So Karl Rove comes out and says, you got no one elected,
[01:43:22.880 --> 01:43:30.480]  I got two people. And they announce it's a mandate with Obama, Obama, Obama. It's all
[01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:32.700]  a hoax cuz they've got a 9% approval rating.
[01:43:32.700 --> 01:43:37.620]  They're imploding, they're in trouble, they're falling apart. So they've got the WWE Republican
[01:43:37.620 --> 01:43:43.840]  run with the big Republican moguls of Jim McMahon and his wife. And you've got Fox News
[01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:47.300]  up there making jokes about an acting like they're against it, but actually pushing it.
[01:43:47.300 --> 01:43:53.040]  And you've got shows on Fox TV demonizing constitutionalist. See, Rupert Murdoch, all
[01:43:53.040 --> 01:43:57.920]  of this trying because the same globalist on the Republicans and the Democrats. And
[01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:03.800]  they're scared of a real revolution in the most likely candidate, the Republican Party,
[01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:10.140]  to get friends in Congress to give moral support to constitutional conservatives and libertarians
[01:44:10.140 --> 01:44:15.500]  in the states to get together with a real movement to take over the Republican Party
[01:44:15.500 --> 01:44:17.020]  and take America back.
[01:44:17.020 --> 01:44:20.960]  That's why they had to put Romney in, one of their establishment types, to kill it to
[01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:27.060]  make sure it failed so that they could claim the mandate. It was rigged at every level,
[01:44:27.060 --> 01:44:33.380]  the fix was in. And they're going for broke right now, not because they're strong, but
[01:44:33.380 --> 01:44:40.180]  because they're 7 to 10 years behind. Even Brzezinski says that, one of their top tacticians.
[01:44:40.180 --> 01:44:45.440]  And they know if they don't get it all done now, it's over. So that's why you're going
[01:44:45.440 --> 01:44:52.420]  to see Fox News try to pacify conservatives.
[01:44:52.420 --> 01:45:02.840]  And they say on there, we don't want Alex Jones to radicalize conservatives. And Alex
[01:45:02.840 --> 01:45:09.500]  Jones doesn't speak for conservatives, you bet. I don't speak for New World Order fake
[01:45:09.500 --> 01:45:15.340]  Republicans. And see Glenn Beck, who's a chameleon, he knows this. Back when Ron Paul had a chance
[01:45:15.340 --> 01:45:18.720]  to win four years ago in the primaries, he shot him down, said his supporters wanna blow
[01:45:18.720 --> 01:45:19.720]  stuff up.
[01:45:19.720 --> 01:45:24.220]  The army needs to be used against him. I'm for the banker bailout. The Bilderberg group's
[01:45:24.220 --> 01:45:29.120]  not bad. Now he's like, I'm a libertarian, and I don't like the Republicans, and I'm
[01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:34.020]  leaving their party. And Karl Rove is taking it over and trying to kill the Tea Party,
[01:45:34.020 --> 01:45:39.700]  which is all true, except, okay, you've got New World Order Karl Rove, probably listening
[01:45:39.700 --> 01:45:40.780]  right now, lives in Austin.
[01:45:40.780 --> 01:45:46.500]  You've got him up here. Total New World Order, because they work for the foreign banks. They
[01:45:46.500 --> 01:45:51.060]  gotta give you a fake choice of Obama or mainline Republicans. And then you've got Glenn Beck
[01:45:51.060 --> 01:45:58.860]  next, who just wants the market of the libertarian conservatives. And he's doing a lot more good
[01:45:58.860 --> 01:46:01.580]  than mainline Republicans, so I'm not bashing him.
[01:46:01.580 --> 01:46:05.780]  It's just that I don't trust him. I mean, these guys are all shifty guy and beyond,
[01:46:05.780 --> 01:46:08.780]  but they're not real. They're all about how they're winners, and they figured out the
[01:46:08.780 --> 01:46:12.880]  angles. Figuring out the angles isn't how you win, folks, in a desperate situation.
[01:46:12.880 --> 01:46:16.820]  You go past the angles. You redefine the game. That's how we're gonna beat this. It's our
[01:46:16.820 --> 01:46:22.020]  only shot, and it's a big shot. We got a really good chance of beating this thing. If you
[01:46:22.020 --> 01:46:25.660]  realize, folks, you're not signing on to some global corporate takeover.
[01:46:25.660 --> 01:46:33.940]  You're signing on to something that makes Hitler look like a uncoordinated schoolboy.
[01:46:33.940 --> 01:46:41.620]  You're talking Incredible Hulk versus a electroshock therapy Hitler, okay? A lobotomized Hitler.
[01:46:41.620 --> 01:46:48.380]  I mean, this is a mean machine, but it only can convert and take over if you're not aware,
[01:46:48.380 --> 01:46:53.820]  if you're not involved, and if you don't realize how over the top, cuckoo, this eugenics takeover
[01:46:53.820 --> 01:46:54.820]  is.
[01:46:54.820 --> 01:47:00.380]  Okay, so we've got all that happening. So I'm calling again for the second American
[01:47:00.380 --> 01:47:03.980]  revolution. And you notice the media tried to spin it. He wants to take up arms. No,
[01:47:03.980 --> 01:47:09.100]  the opposite. I wanna take up info weapons. The pen is mightier than the sword, the keyboard,
[01:47:09.100 --> 01:47:16.200]  the bullhorn, the banner hang, the bumper sticker, now, now, now, now, now, now.
[01:47:16.200 --> 01:47:21.340]  And realize the unbelievable holy mission you're on. I mean, you are literally in the
[01:47:21.340 --> 01:47:25.220]  footsteps. Our forebearers fought the greatest empire the world had ever seen, never been
[01:47:25.220 --> 01:47:26.220]  beaten.
[01:47:26.220 --> 01:47:31.780]  And to be honest with you, the British redcoats were not that evil compared to what we face.
[01:47:31.780 --> 01:47:39.860]  They were powerful. But the reason our forebearers committed to fighting something and never
[01:47:39.860 --> 01:47:44.540]  been beaten, because it was horrible to be a slave. It was horrible to be humiliated.
[01:47:44.540 --> 01:47:48.560]  And they saw things getting worse. And they saw their lands being taken and their kids
[01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:54.700]  being pressed as slaves, white slaves. They just called it impressment, didn't call slavery.
[01:47:54.700 --> 01:47:59.500]  For 10-year stints on ships where the average person only lived about five years, you had
[01:47:59.500 --> 01:48:01.340]  a very low chance of living.
[01:48:01.340 --> 01:48:05.780]  They would go around town and grab men, women, and children mainly. Well, not really women,
[01:48:05.780 --> 01:48:08.700]  that was later. But the point is, they would grab women for other service, but they would
[01:48:08.700 --> 01:48:14.500]  grab boys and men. But boys mainly because they could be made to serve. For the hellish,
[01:48:14.500 --> 01:48:20.660]  hellish slave trade, you name it, that was going on on the east coast of Africa.
[01:48:20.660 --> 01:48:26.020]  The point is, I don't wanna digress into history here, we don't have a choice. And hell, you
[01:48:26.020 --> 01:48:30.220]  can go get Jack Daniels and Prozac and go watch the football game and say, I don't care,
[01:48:30.220 --> 01:48:36.620]  devil take it, that's your business. But this is the animating contest for liberty. This
[01:48:36.620 --> 01:48:38.180]  is the real deal.
[01:48:38.180 --> 01:48:44.540]  And the entire globalist program is focused on demonizing the Tea Party, veterans, gun
[01:48:44.540 --> 01:48:51.820]  runners, constitutionalist in the fetters. And why? Because we carry with us what made
[01:48:51.820 --> 01:48:58.860]  America great. We are the Americans, we are the informed, we are the people that are left.
[01:48:58.860 --> 01:49:03.860]  We're the real elite. We're the real remnant, whether you're black, white, Hispanic, Asian,
[01:49:03.860 --> 01:49:08.220]  German, Chinese, Jewish, Tasmanian.
[01:49:08.220 --> 01:49:13.780]  The point is, you're it. And if you're listening anywhere in the world, you're facing the same
[01:49:13.780 --> 01:49:21.220]  global corporate design program, unified agenda, same textbook, same name, same deal. And you're
[01:49:21.220 --> 01:49:26.100]  it, we are humanity's best and only hope, and God is behind us. But listen, you gotta
[01:49:26.100 --> 01:49:30.380]  take the first steps and say, God, I'm gonna fight the corruption, I'm gonna do the best,
[01:49:30.380 --> 01:49:31.380]  show me what to do.
[01:49:31.380 --> 01:49:38.000]  Say that prayer, even though I don't, whether you're a Christian, a Jewish, Muslim, an atheist.
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:42.720]  If you don't even believe in God and spiritualism or whatever you wanna call it, asking the
[01:49:42.720 --> 01:49:53.260]  ether, asking the source. I wanna be good, I wanna fight corruption, I don't know what
[01:49:53.260 --> 01:49:56.940]  to do. Open up the doors for me, show me what to do.
[01:49:56.940 --> 01:50:07.820]  The universe, the doors will just open. The universe, as Martin Luther King said, justice
[01:50:07.820 --> 01:50:12.660]  is there in the universe and the universe bends towards justice, the providence. You've
[01:50:12.660 --> 01:50:17.940]  gotta ask for the providence. You've gotta decide you wanna be good. You've gotta decide
[01:50:17.940 --> 01:50:22.380]  you want the truth. You've gotta decide you want liberty. You gotta decide you don't wanna
[01:50:22.380 --> 01:50:28.460]  be ruled by bad people, because here's the thing about evil.
[01:50:28.460 --> 01:50:33.980]  Once you get bad guys in place, but who aren't completely sadistic and murderous, they'll
[01:50:33.980 --> 01:50:37.540]  be replaced by those that are worse, and then those that are worse, and those that are worse.
[01:50:37.540 --> 01:50:44.340]  That's why you always get such crazy wild men, royalty bathing in children's blood or
[01:50:44.340 --> 01:50:49.960]  burning down old cities or declaring themselves God or demanding human sacrifices, because
[01:50:49.960 --> 01:50:56.140]  megalomaniac psychopaths will always end up taking over a big government. We're in deep
[01:50:56.140 --> 01:51:01.500]  trouble. We need 1776 worldwide now.
[01:51:01.500 --> 01:51:05.700]  Your freedoms are on the line. The Second Amendment is in danger. How soon before your
[01:51:05.700 --> 01:51:10.460]  freedoms are taken away? What can you not live without? What is your greatest dependency?
[01:51:10.460 --> 01:51:15.940]  Is it your guns? Is it your home? No, it's food. It all boils down to the food supply.
[01:51:15.940 --> 01:51:20.780]  Tyrannical governments control people by controlling their food supply. Don't be dependent. Be
[01:51:20.780 --> 01:51:25.260]  self-sufficient. Don't wait for the government to feed you. Feed yourself. I can warn you,
[01:51:25.260 --> 01:51:30.300]  but I can't feed you. Do like Alex has done and get a supply of food from e Foods Direct.

[01:53:55.100 --> 01:54:02.060]  ranch, goldenstagsafaris.com. Hey, dawg, could you scare up another round for our table over
[01:54:02.060 --> 01:54:06.820]  here and tell the cook this is low-grade dog food, all right? And here, take this for yourself,
[01:54:06.820 --> 01:54:11.660]  okay? Geez, I had better food at the ball game, you know. I tell you, this steak still
[01:54:11.660 --> 01:54:23.500]  has marks where the jockey was hit. Dog food! Hey, where's the bottle? Let's have some drinks
[01:54:23.500 --> 01:54:28.540]  here, see what's going on for crying out loud. Hey, waiter here, this is for you, all right?
[01:54:28.540 --> 01:54:33.460]  Oh, Captain Hook. How about the grand you owe me, huh? Ah, forget about it, I'm just
[01:54:33.460 --> 01:54:38.300]  kidding, all right? Oh, this your wife, oh, a lovely lady. Hey, baby, you're all right.
[01:54:38.300 --> 01:54:43.860]  You must have been something before electricity, huh? Hey, doll, how are you, huh? You live
[01:54:43.860 --> 01:54:49.260]  alone? Hey, rabbi, nice seeing you. Look who you are. Folks, how are you, huh? And this
[01:54:49.260 --> 01:54:53.660]  your grandson, huh? Oh, wonderful boy, nice boy, right? He's a good boy, I'll tell you.
[01:54:53.660 --> 01:55:05.220]  Now I know why tigers eat their young, you know? Whoops, the dance of the living dead.
[01:55:05.220 --> 01:55:08.320]  And I thought we'd play that, cuz I haven't talked much about the horse meat scandal that's
[01:55:08.320 --> 01:55:15.120]  so huge now, and how it ties into all this, but here's USA Today. Fish fraud is off the
[01:55:15.120 --> 01:55:23.360]  scale at restaurants nationwide, and you're paying top dollar for snapper or flounder or
[01:55:23.360 --> 01:55:27.340]  whatever the case could be, swordfish, and you're really getting tilapia that they've
[01:55:27.340 --> 01:55:31.140]  reformed and they've got all these ways to make it fake, kinda like the red slime, the
[01:55:31.140 --> 01:55:35.580]  pink slime. But you know what? I know what all these big industries can do, the fish
[01:55:35.580 --> 01:55:39.780]  industry, the restaurant industry, Nestle and others caught with the horse meat. Just
[01:55:39.780 --> 01:55:41.460]  say it's a conspiracy theory.
[01:55:41.460 --> 01:55:46.620]  Hell, you could serve them, well, the Japanese are actually coming out with this reconstituted
[01:55:46.620 --> 01:55:53.700]  feces. If you guys pull up poop as meat, it's a Japanese TV, but you can show the viewers,
[01:55:53.700 --> 01:55:59.680]  radio listeners. I mean, hell, you could have, I'm not kidding, with the average American,
[01:55:59.680 --> 01:56:04.940]  you could have, you could put like a centipede on their plate and tell them it's beef. And
[01:56:04.940 --> 01:56:09.260]  if they say that looks like a centipede, go conspiracy theory and then go, okay, let me
[01:56:09.260 --> 01:56:12.860]  eat that large redheaded Texas centipede.
[01:56:12.860 --> 01:56:17.280]  I say that cuz I caught one this morning, the kid's got a kick out of it. The point
[01:56:17.280 --> 01:56:22.660]  is is that, yeah, there it is, fade it up, fade up the poop meat. People think I'm joking.
[01:56:22.660 --> 01:56:27.420]  Can we fade up the poop meat, please? I mean, you think I'm joking here, but you know what?
[01:56:27.420 --> 01:56:36.500]  It's not poop, it's a conspiracy. It's a conspiracy theory. And of course, natural news has pointed
[01:56:36.500 --> 01:56:42.020]  out, how about bromine in not just Gatorade, but scores of other soft drinks that will
[01:56:42.020 --> 01:56:46.260]  give you cancer and infertility and also make you have mental illness.
[01:56:46.260 --> 01:56:52.060]  How's that sound? Yeah, in Japan, they have the new meat product, as they say, it's quite
[01:56:52.060 --> 01:56:56.340]  delicious, poop, human poop. Here it is, you're a TV viewer, I'm not kidding.
[01:56:56.340 --> 01:57:05.420]  Sewage mud contains a great deal of protein. We research whether we can extract the protein
[01:57:05.420 --> 01:57:10.020]  and recycle it. The process creates delicious meat.
[01:57:10.020 --> 01:57:15.900]  Sewage mud is rich in protein because it is alive with bacteria. These bacteria are harmless
[01:57:15.900 --> 01:57:19.060]  because they are killed by heat during the manufacturing process.
[01:57:19.060 --> 01:57:22.500]  Look at that poop meat.
[01:57:22.500 --> 01:57:28.140]  The red color is obtained by using food coloring. The artificial steak, according to initial
[01:57:28.140 --> 01:57:35.780]  tests, even tastes like beef. In fact, to refine the flavor, Professor Ikeda enjoys
[01:57:35.780 --> 01:57:36.780]  eating it himself.
[01:57:36.780 --> 01:57:43.220]  You think I'm joking about this stuff? Folks, they spray live viruses, poop viruses on most
[01:57:43.220 --> 01:57:48.920]  meat you eat. They won't believe that. Type in viruses sprayed on meat. It's six years
[01:57:48.920 --> 01:57:54.180]  old, ABC News. They radiated everything. They sprayed poop viruses on it. Hope you enjoy
[01:57:54.180 --> 01:57:55.180]  it.
[01:57:55.180 --> 01:58:00.340]  It's good for you. You think I'm joking about poop viruses? Whatever, in Latin, it translates
[01:58:00.340 --> 01:58:05.220]  to poop eating viruses or viruses that eat poop eating bacteria, I guess is the full
[01:58:05.220 --> 01:58:10.580]  quote. I'll tell you, having knowledge is the beginning of sorrow. I think it's somewhere
[01:58:10.580 --> 01:58:11.780]  in the Bible.
[01:58:11.780 --> 01:58:14.700]  The bottom line is they're afraid of states' rights movements. They're telling you you
[01:58:14.700 --> 01:58:17.980]  have no power. They're telling you the Tea Party's dead, the Republican and Democratic
[01:58:17.980 --> 01:58:21.540]  parties because it's the steak that can go to the vampire's heart. It's the high noon
[01:58:21.540 --> 01:58:26.720]  to Count Chocula, okay? It is the holy water.
[01:58:26.720 --> 01:58:30.460]  To that Renfield-like creature known as Janet Napolitano that walks around dragging her
[01:58:30.460 --> 01:58:36.620]  knuckles on the ground like some type of albino possum re-engineered with a chimpanzee. Your

[02:00:12.540 --> 02:00:21.900]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:21.900 --> 02:00:27.460]  I have decided to become a trendy for at least the next five minutes. I want to say there
[02:00:27.460 --> 02:00:32.580]  is no horse meat being fed to anyone that they claim as beef. That is a conspiracy.
[02:00:32.580 --> 02:00:36.500]  There are no drones operating domestically. The NSA is not listening to us. There is no
[02:00:36.500 --> 02:00:41.660]  world government even though it's all been announced. And everything's fine and USA Today
[02:00:41.660 --> 02:00:47.380]  is lying. No restaurants serve you a lower quality fish and mislabel it. There is no
[02:00:47.380 --> 02:00:54.660]  lying. No one should question anything. Everything's fine. The government loves you. There. There.
[02:00:54.660 --> 02:00:58.100]  Let's go to your phone calls. A bunch of your calls and I'm gonna get into the main news.
[02:00:58.100 --> 02:01:02.980]  I've covered some of it, but the economy and a lot more coming up right now. Let's talk
[02:01:02.980 --> 02:01:08.460]  to Jeremy in Texas. Jeremy, thank you for patiently holding her on the air, sir.
[02:01:08.460 --> 02:01:12.780]  Thank you, sir. Thanks for taking my call. I was calling in because you'd asked for what
[02:01:12.780 --> 02:01:14.780]  we think some solutions can be.
[02:01:14.780 --> 02:01:18.420]  Hold on a minute. We gotta have the record skipping. You actually called in on what I
[02:01:18.420 --> 02:01:22.260]  asked you to call in about. This may be a first. Go ahead.
[02:01:22.260 --> 02:01:28.700]  Well, my story was a few years ago. I'm going in my third year now as a Prison Planet TV
[02:01:28.700 --> 02:01:33.300]  member. Three years ago, I was what you would call an evangelical Christian at Hagee's church
[02:01:33.300 --> 02:01:38.580]  here in San Antonio. I was a leader in the church, taught Bible study, taught marriage
[02:01:38.580 --> 02:01:46.820]  intimacy and was a big believer in the pre-trib rapture until I had been listening to you
[02:01:46.820 --> 02:01:51.780]  a little bit. I wouldn't say I didn't believe you, but I just found it interesting until
[02:01:51.780 --> 02:01:56.620]  you had brought up about how, you know, we were going to live through the tribulation
[02:01:56.620 --> 02:02:00.660]  and then the rapture was going to happen after that, that the Rockefeller Foundation had
[02:02:00.660 --> 02:02:04.540]  started introducing that in the 1800s. Well, I'm one of the people that still actually
[02:02:04.540 --> 02:02:09.500]  research stuff. And when I researched it, I went back and I found out that what you
[02:02:09.500 --> 02:02:14.980]  said was absolutely true. There's nothing in history except for, I think, some Roman
[02:02:14.980 --> 02:02:20.220]  priest that mentioned it a thousand years ago just as a as a paper. But before then
[02:02:20.220 --> 02:02:24.100]  we had I mean, I mean, the Gnostics thought that a little bit, but but but it wasn't the
[02:02:24.100 --> 02:02:31.340]  same thing. Yeah. Yeah. But it wasn't until then that I really believed you. And I mean,
[02:02:31.340 --> 02:02:37.340]  you are 100 percent responsible for bringing me out of the matrix. I am an evangelical.
[02:02:37.340 --> 02:02:41.620]  I am a Christian. And then, of course, now with Pastor Anderson's movie that came out,
[02:02:41.620 --> 02:02:46.620]  which I think is absolutely amazing. But but, you know, being in the church that I was in
[02:02:46.620 --> 02:02:51.700]  here, I don't go there anymore. I mean, I was I was a lemming. I was a neocon. I was
[02:02:51.700 --> 02:02:56.500]  exactly what happened when you started telling people, hey, the beast will wage war against
[02:02:56.500 --> 02:02:59.900]  the saints and overcome them. I mean, what did they say to you? I mean, you try to wake
[02:02:59.900 --> 02:03:06.140]  them up. Oh, absolutely. I've been doing that for three years. I had, you know, 50 or 60
[02:03:06.140 --> 02:03:11.140]  friends that went to that church on Facebook that are no longer my friends. You know, they
[02:03:11.140 --> 02:03:17.180]  defriended me. But I am so afraid that you don't agree with them because, oh, there's
[02:03:17.180 --> 02:03:21.220]  nothing bad going to happen to us. We're going to make it. Did any of the Christians ever
[02:03:21.220 --> 02:03:26.100]  get teleported out? Well, sometimes they did, like the lion's den or the fiery furnace,
[02:03:26.100 --> 02:03:32.680]  but they had to go into it first. Yeah, absolutely. And Noah didn't it taken off Earth? He stayed.
[02:03:32.680 --> 02:03:36.080]  So I mean, the history of the Bible shows that every time they went through tribulation,
[02:03:36.080 --> 02:03:40.360]  God never took him out of it. They had to stay through it. But did they get a raptured
[02:03:40.360 --> 02:03:43.700]  out with the lions? Or a lot of Christians thought they were going to be raptured Nazi
[02:03:43.700 --> 02:03:49.780]  Germany. Did that happen? No, absolutely not. And but what I was saying about them is they
[02:03:49.780 --> 02:03:55.660]  are I've been I was at that church for seven or eight years, and they brought in historians
[02:03:55.660 --> 02:04:00.780]  and people that talked about the founding fathers in a good way. They're gunners, they're
[02:04:00.780 --> 02:04:05.460]  hunters, they're fishers. I mean, they're they're everything that you talk about that
[02:04:05.460 --> 02:04:11.700]  fight. But the one key thing that holds them up from opening their mind is thinking that
[02:04:11.700 --> 02:04:16.260]  they don't have to fight because in that church, they don't they don't teach Romans 13. In
[02:04:16.260 --> 02:04:20.740]  other words, I could tell you, it's a self fulfilling prophecy that it's all going to
[02:04:20.740 --> 02:04:26.100]  end anyways. And for the New Agers, they gave them 2012. Oh, well, why be involved? 2012
[02:04:26.100 --> 02:04:30.540]  is the end of the world. You see how they Frank Herbert called it the missionary and
[02:04:30.540 --> 02:04:36.140]  protectorate, where they would implant grips to create false ideas of giving up and there's
[02:04:36.140 --> 02:04:41.220]  no point. So that when then they sit in their control, people, everybody would stand down.
[02:04:41.220 --> 02:04:45.220]  Great points. I know that's why we have the film after the tribulation. Let no man deceive

[02:06:04.820 --> 02:06:09.900]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working. My body was literally starving
[02:06:09.900 --> 02:06:14.620]  for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins. And as soon as I had that, I
[02:06:14.620 --> 02:06:20.020]  immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied. Now there are

[02:08:21.700 --> 02:08:27.340]  right to your phone calls and then if you go to mfallwars.com or prisonplanet.com, citizens
[02:08:27.340 --> 02:08:33.100]  applaud defeat of firearms ban in Massachusetts. The problem is they've got our kids. I've
[02:08:33.100 --> 02:08:37.060]  actually had a handgun control link or an article I was in like 10 years ago go, it
[02:08:37.060 --> 02:08:41.320]  doesn't matter if you beat this bill now, we have control of the education system and
[02:08:41.320 --> 02:08:45.580]  your children. I probably read that quote like 25 times on air. It was in the Austin
[02:08:45.580 --> 02:08:53.260]  American Statesman, doesn't matter, long term. It's all about dominating, all about, see
[02:08:53.260 --> 02:09:00.780]  for the government type, that's how they move up. They move up by making you their slave.
[02:09:00.780 --> 02:09:05.900]  TSA apologizes for harassing another wheelchair bound toddler. Yeah, they'll say get up. I'm
[02:09:05.900 --> 02:09:13.300]  sorry, my son's a quadriplegic. Shut up, terrorist, get back. Stocks plunge as Fed members admit
[02:09:13.300 --> 02:09:18.460]  that endless bond buying will not fix economy.
[02:09:18.460 --> 02:09:22.300]  Sheriff responds to attacks over second revolution comments. We're gonna be getting to that,
[02:09:22.300 --> 02:09:28.340]  it's powerful. Gun control was historically about repressing blacks. 20 signs the US economy
[02:09:28.340 --> 02:09:33.300]  is headed towards big trouble in the months ahead. Really, you think so? Killing the dollar.
[02:09:33.300 --> 02:09:40.380]  G20 and IMF push for global Fed, global currency, global government. As a solution, we did all
[02:09:40.380 --> 02:09:45.540]  this on purpose. Give us more power, that'll fix it. And then huge online film festival
[02:09:45.540 --> 02:09:48.740]  launched video at infowars.com.
[02:09:48.740 --> 02:09:52.180]  That's just some of the news on infowars.com. We'll look at drudgereport.com. We'll look
[02:09:52.180 --> 02:09:55.500]  at a bunch of other news. But I promise, let's go to your calls. I promise to go to calls
[02:09:55.500 --> 02:10:02.420]  800-259-9231. We'll go to John, then Charles, then Sean, and then Chad, and then Casey,
[02:10:02.420 --> 02:10:06.940]  and then to the news. Let's go to John in New Jersey. You're on the air, sir. Thank
[02:10:06.940 --> 02:10:07.940]  you for holding.
[02:10:07.940 --> 02:10:10.700]  Hey, Alex. Go ahead.
[02:10:10.700 --> 02:10:18.900]  I just had some points to go through. I know you get very frustrated sometimes, and quite
[02:10:18.900 --> 02:10:26.460]  frankly, so do I, because when I see people who are that asleep, where you can say something
[02:10:26.460 --> 02:10:31.340]  that's out in the open, like the NDAA, for example, and they'll just come back at you
[02:10:31.340 --> 02:10:37.180]  trying to sound so smart, and like they're so educated, and just spin something.
[02:10:37.180 --> 02:10:42.460]  It's good to spray viruses on cutlets of meat. It's good to radiate it. It's good the Japanese
[02:10:42.460 --> 02:10:47.700]  are now eating human poop turned into steaks. It's good they're putting cancer viruses in
[02:10:47.700 --> 02:10:53.220]  the vaccines. I have articles where they're giving little kids flu shots and they're dying,
[02:10:53.220 --> 02:10:55.380]  and then the government goes, we don't know why they're dying.
[02:10:55.380 --> 02:10:59.480]  We're not gonna indict the parents. And then it comes out, they were injected a day before
[02:10:59.480 --> 02:11:03.980]  with a flu shot. I mean, it's real simple. You take the flu shot, sometimes you die.
[02:11:03.980 --> 02:11:08.980]  The stinking insert, the CDC's own site says it may kill you. But people are like, there's
[02:11:08.980 --> 02:11:13.860]  no way they're killing us. That's my point. People say, how did the Germans put up with
[02:11:13.860 --> 02:11:15.100]  what they put up with?
[02:11:15.100 --> 02:11:20.660]  By successive approximation, by incrementalism. Sorry, go ahead.
[02:11:20.660 --> 02:11:27.860]  No, yes, because basically, our problem as a country is we're too used to having everything
[02:11:27.860 --> 02:11:32.780]  done for us, where people are at the point where they won't go out and actually read
[02:11:32.780 --> 02:11:36.660]  the insert of the flu shot. They'll just take it because the establishment says to take
[02:11:36.660 --> 02:11:40.940]  it. And people don't think that they need guns. Well, I've never needed it before. Well,
[02:11:40.940 --> 02:11:45.620]  trust me, when this whole thing starts, you're gonna be pretty sorry if you don't have one.
[02:11:45.620 --> 02:11:50.280]  And basically, everyone is too used to the fact that we haven't had a large-scale national
[02:11:50.280 --> 02:11:55.820]  crisis in quite a while, to the point that everyone's just so lethargic now, which my
[02:11:55.820 --> 02:12:01.860]  response to that would be, shouldn't we, in the whole liberty movement, be promoting things
[02:12:01.860 --> 02:12:03.100]  more along the lines of-
[02:12:03.100 --> 02:12:07.620]  No, no, that's it. But if we can get the yuppies, who are riding bikes every day and into all
[02:12:07.620 --> 02:12:11.780]  that to show some energy about the Bill of Rights and Constitution that produced all
[02:12:11.780 --> 02:12:12.780]  the wealth.
[02:12:12.780 --> 02:12:16.060]  I mean, even if you're a cynical person that doesn't care about anybody, not having liberty
[02:12:16.060 --> 02:12:22.280]  makes it a very bad place to live with no due process and where, horse meets the tip
[02:12:22.280 --> 02:12:28.860]  of the iceberg. It's bad drugs, it's bad food, it's bad water, it's bad air by design. It's
[02:12:28.860 --> 02:12:33.620]  a lying government that's already taken the pension funds, the money's already gone.
[02:12:33.620 --> 02:12:38.460]  They're just getting martial law ready for when the shoe drops. That's another thing.
[02:12:38.460 --> 02:12:42.300]  People are like, so what if the government has 2 billion rounds in training for gun confiscation?
[02:12:42.300 --> 02:12:48.060]  I don't own guns, you idiots. What do you think? That's a civil war they're gearing
[02:12:48.060 --> 02:12:53.180]  up for. That means an end to all of this. And they've taken down Argentina, they've
[02:12:53.180 --> 02:12:59.860]  taken down Brazil, they've taken down Nigeria, they've taken down Greece.
[02:12:59.860 --> 02:13:06.940]  They've taken down Spain, Portugal, once prosperous areas have protests with 5 million people
[02:13:06.940 --> 02:13:12.900]  and burning buildings every week. And people starving to death and cops killing people
[02:13:12.900 --> 02:13:18.020]  and it's not even news anymore. I want everybody to get it straight here. The globalists are
[02:13:18.020 --> 02:13:23.780]  running revolutions worldwide. They're putting Al-Qaeda in. They will tear this country from
[02:13:23.780 --> 02:13:27.600]  one end to the other and set offshore while it happens.
[02:13:27.600 --> 02:13:32.380]  They've taught so many yuppies. They go, I don't care, kill the Iraqis, they're not human.
[02:13:32.380 --> 02:13:36.220]  Do you think the globalists who don't think Iraqis are human think you're human either?
[02:13:36.220 --> 02:13:41.060]  They respect them a lot more than your big lazy butt. They think he was a dumb animal
[02:13:41.060 --> 02:13:44.900]  who they don't want to take care of anymore. You're like, but I work, they don't care.
[02:13:44.900 --> 02:13:49.380]  They see the resources as theirs. They don't think you're human. They don't think you deserve
[02:13:49.380 --> 02:13:50.740]  to live.
[02:13:50.740 --> 02:13:54.200]  And here's my beef with the globalist. Maybe some of the public who wants to be slaves
[02:13:54.200 --> 02:13:59.340]  and hear this, maybe they do deserve to be slaves. I don't, okay? I'm not gonna be a
[02:13:59.340 --> 02:14:02.900]  slave. And the globalists say, well, you better join us. I'm not joining a bunch of people
[02:14:02.900 --> 02:14:06.500]  that are into child sex slavery and stuff.
[02:14:06.500 --> 02:14:11.580]  You people are evil. I'm not joining the big crowd of lazy, self-propelled stomachs. And
[02:14:11.580 --> 02:14:15.740]  I'm not joining the New World Order either. I want my republic back. And that happens
[02:14:15.740 --> 02:14:20.100]  by cutting all these people off welfare, and making everybody tough, and cutting the corporate
[02:14:20.100 --> 02:14:24.180]  welfare off, and arresting these globalists, and hanging their asses high.
[02:14:24.180 --> 02:14:31.780]  I appreciate your call. Excuse me. And I mean, after due process, jury trials everything.
[02:14:31.780 --> 02:14:37.060]  Espionage. We need to make an example. I'd be more than happy if the globalists are kicked
[02:14:37.060 --> 02:14:39.440]  out to give them amnesty and let them leave.
[02:14:39.440 --> 02:14:43.420]  But what country would take the New World Order minions? All right, let's go ahead and
[02:14:43.420 --> 02:14:46.940]  talk to Charles in Florida. Charles, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:14:46.940 --> 02:14:50.580]  Hey, what's up, my brother? How you doing? Good.
[02:14:50.580 --> 02:14:56.460]  I just wanna talk to you about the WWE and PlayStation 4. I'm a big martial arts fan.
[02:14:56.460 --> 02:15:02.820]  I've been watching the WWE since I was two years old. And just noticing it now, but they
[02:15:02.820 --> 02:15:07.780]  've done with Jack Swagger. They've been laying the groundwork for about 15 years to demonize
[02:15:07.780 --> 02:15:13.860]  Patriots and anyone who just identifies himself as an American national.
[02:15:13.860 --> 02:15:20.220]  It started with Kurt Angle, cuz he started back in 1999. He's really just the basic same
[02:15:20.220 --> 02:15:27.980]  gimmick as Jack Swagger. All American American, American hero, American wrestler. And he's
[02:15:27.980 --> 02:15:33.180]  been a heel. When he first started, he was a heel. That's a bad guy. And he turned to
[02:15:33.180 --> 02:15:38.100]  a baby face because the crowd, they were so into him cuz he was so talented.
[02:15:38.100 --> 02:15:42.780]  But Jack Swagger started about five, six years ago. And he's always been a heel. He's never
[02:15:42.780 --> 02:15:47.980]  been a good guy ever. So I mean, with his new gimmick coming back, he came back about
[02:15:47.980 --> 02:15:52.140]  three weeks ago. He was supposed to be a good guy, but they changed their mind cuz all of
[02:15:52.140 --> 02:15:58.940]  a sudden, they decided to turn Alberto Del Rio, who was a bad guy since he started, overnight
[02:15:58.940 --> 02:15:59.940]  he was a good guy.
[02:15:59.940 --> 02:16:04.020]  Cuz he was a baby face, so I mean, they didn't. Well, no, I mean, there's nothing worse than
[02:16:04.020 --> 02:16:10.340]  a white person. And so obviously, he's the new bad guy who wants sovereignty, and then
[02:16:10.340 --> 02:16:15.020]  he's gonna be defeated by the loving Mexican. And this is to admit, cuz a lot of people
[02:16:15.020 --> 02:16:18.140]  that watch wrestling watch it for the entertainment, it is very funny, interesting.
[02:16:18.140 --> 02:16:22.980]  But others, there are people there who think it's real, and this creates that background
[02:16:22.980 --> 02:16:29.180]  and then they go, all the problems in America are the Mexicans. And that's obviously not
[02:16:29.180 --> 02:16:33.660]  true. So then it discredits that if we want any sovereignty and don't want a North American
[02:16:33.660 --> 02:16:39.460]  Union to be totally imploded, Mexico's imploding, then you hate all Mexicans.
[02:16:39.460 --> 02:16:43.140]  When Mexicans that are Americans had any sense, which a lot of them do, they'd say, wait a
[02:16:43.140 --> 02:16:46.380]  minute, Mexico's imploding. It doesn't help Mexicans to bring them here and lower all
[02:16:46.380 --> 02:16:51.320]  our wages. We need to get Mexico back as a free country. And so it's purely meant to
[02:16:51.320 --> 02:16:56.180]  create division and people say, Alex, it's just entertainment. They admit the Department
[02:16:56.180 --> 02:16:59.340]  of Justice and Defense and the Globalist fund these anti-patriot, anti-veteran.
[02:16:59.340 --> 02:17:05.700]  I wanna say that again, the Department of Justice and Defense fund anti-patriot military
[02:17:05.700 --> 02:17:10.780]  messages because they hate the veterans, because they're not under their control anymore. I
[02:17:10.780 --> 02:17:16.300]  mean, this is treasonous, this is ridiculous. Obviously, the bad guys demonize the veterans,
[02:17:16.300 --> 02:17:21.020]  the bad guys demonize George Washington, the bad guys demonize the family, the bad guys
[02:17:21.020 --> 02:17:26.780]  push abortion, the bad guys push socialism. And look what the media pushes, including
[02:17:26.780 --> 02:17:30.460]  Fox News Corp properties who claim they're so conservative.
[02:17:30.460 --> 02:17:36.420]  If Rupert Murdoch was a real conservative, he brags, we have the promo video where he's
[02:17:36.420 --> 02:17:41.500]  the chairman, he's the president of News Corp. We played it many years ago. Call Paul Watson,
[02:17:41.500 --> 02:17:45.980]  it's so old, he'll know how to find it. It's something like News Corp promotes carbon taxes,
[02:17:45.980 --> 02:17:50.860]  and they brag. Here are all of our current lineup of shows promoting the carbon taxes
[02:17:50.860 --> 02:17:55.620]  and carbon footprint and bringing in the new green economy. And they show all the shows
[02:17:55.620 --> 02:17:56.620]  they're doing it.
[02:17:56.620 --> 02:18:00.620]  See, they have to control the conservative movement. They have to be loyal opposition.
[02:18:00.620 --> 02:18:01.900]  Do you understand that?
[02:18:01.900 --> 02:18:08.420]  Right, right, you're correct. The thing is, if the WAV, I mean, I will say since the Iraq
[02:18:08.420 --> 02:18:16.460]  war, they have been the ground floor for anything that's propaganda. If it's propaganda, they're
[02:18:16.460 --> 02:18:21.180]  gonna do it, especially in the last four years when Linda started her campaign.
[02:18:21.180 --> 02:18:28.140]  They would just straight up, the commercials, they would be two hours straight just entertainment.
[02:18:28.140 --> 02:18:34.060]  But four years ago, they just started, they go to commercial in the match, here's propaganda,
[02:18:34.060 --> 02:18:38.020]  the WWE is with the troops. We just stopped the whole show, we wanna thank the troops
[02:18:38.020 --> 02:18:39.020]  for everything they're doing.
[02:18:39.020 --> 02:18:42.540]  No, it's part of living in a North Korean society. It doesn't mean thank the troops,
[02:18:42.540 --> 02:18:46.900]  they thank the police state, they thank the global empire. They thank the New World Order
[02:18:46.900 --> 02:18:49.500]  to get you ready for troops on the streets.
[02:18:49.500 --> 02:18:54.900]  Kentucky Derby, NFL, troops as the security, armed troops, they're getting us ready. I
[02:18:54.900 --> 02:19:00.220]  really appreciate your call, sir. And again, whoever that guy is with Jack Swaggart, his
[02:19:00.220 --> 02:19:10.140]  manager, the other actor, has a red Yosemite Sam, Zeb Coulter has a red Yosemite Sam mustache
[02:19:10.140 --> 02:19:19.300]  and he's short like Yosemite Sam. And he goes, I hate rabbits, I hate Mexicans.
[02:19:19.300 --> 02:19:23.500]  I mean, they directly, I know when the behind the scenes meetings are like, you will now
[02:19:23.500 --> 02:19:30.300]  start looking like Yosemite Sam, or you look like Yosemite Sam, you'll go out and do this.
[02:19:30.300 --> 02:19:35.820]  And it's the full, you've got Karl Rove saying, open the borders, world government, socialism
[02:19:35.820 --> 02:19:41.240]  is good. The Tea Party is evil and it's weak and it's dead and it's over.
[02:19:41.240 --> 02:19:45.420]  And you've got the same thing coming out of the WWE. That's because the Tea Party is the
[02:19:45.420 --> 02:19:52.180]  only hope. The ideas of the real Tea Party, the real libertarian constitutional rediscovery
[02:19:52.180 --> 02:20:01.100]  of America. We need 1498 part douche. We'll be right back with Sean and others.

[02:24:20.140 --> 02:24:24.460]  then followed by more of your calls. We've got a special Infowars Nightly News coming
[02:24:24.460 --> 02:24:32.100]  up tonight, 7 o'clock central. The destination is prisonplanet.tv. Let's talk to Sean from
[02:24:32.100 --> 02:24:35.700]  New York, New York City. Go ahead, sir.
[02:24:35.700 --> 02:24:40.460]  How are you doing, Mr. Jones? I wanted to talk to you about some things that are fundamental.
[02:24:40.460 --> 02:24:45.900]  When I try to explain to people about an elite globalist agenda, most of the time they're
[02:24:45.900 --> 02:24:52.660]  going to associate it with Illuminati. And the thing is, is that they want to know who
[02:24:52.660 --> 02:25:00.460]  are these people? But actually I've read some investigations and I read that once you sit
[02:25:00.460 --> 02:25:06.860]  through that bureaucracy and those subsidiaries and the parent companies and the mega corporations
[02:25:06.860 --> 02:25:12.300]  and the conglomerates and the monopolies that there's owners and maybe there's a handful
[02:25:12.300 --> 02:25:15.620]  of people, maybe less than 200 people that actually own everything.
[02:25:15.620 --> 02:25:19.780]  No, you're right. There are less than 200 and they're busy trying to make us totally
[02:25:19.780 --> 02:25:25.340]  poor not to control us, but so they can get us in a position to then kill us. I mean,
[02:25:25.340 --> 02:25:28.900]  and they write all these publications saying they're going to do it. I mean, guys type
[02:25:28.900 --> 02:25:35.540]  in Rockefeller and others, rich, mean and secret to discuss overpopulation and it was
[02:25:35.540 --> 02:25:36.540]  all over the news.
[02:25:36.540 --> 02:25:40.740]  Well, yeah, they're setting up a global government to reduce population. And then the average
[02:25:40.740 --> 02:25:46.300]  yuppie goes, there are too many people. Yeah, dummy and they're putting poison in your water,
[02:25:46.300 --> 02:25:53.540]  you moron. Stop imagining you're part of the controllers killing people, reflected glory.
[02:25:53.540 --> 02:25:59.440]  I'm part of it. I agree with the plan, then kill yourself. I don't wanna die and I'm not
[02:25:59.440 --> 02:26:01.500]  signed on to this plan.
[02:26:01.500 --> 02:26:06.500]  Not in my name. I don't wanna go to hell. And even if you don't believe in hell, my
[02:26:06.500 --> 02:26:12.940]  gut doesn't like hurting innocent people. So I'm not signed on to it. I hate certain
[02:26:12.940 --> 02:26:15.740]  innocent people. All right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, Dashawn.
[02:26:15.740 --> 02:26:23.340]  Yeah, so it seems as if they control everything and their family lineage is on top of that
[02:26:23.340 --> 02:26:28.220]  hierarchy and I just continue. But I know that you talk a lot about the left and the
[02:26:28.220 --> 02:26:34.340]  right. And it's just so happened that I have heard about Obama when he won the candidacy
[02:26:34.340 --> 02:26:42.580]  to be a Democrat versus Hillary Clinton or where Bilderberg was in town at that time.
[02:26:42.580 --> 02:26:49.740]  And I remember that they were all in the press plane and he may have secretly met with Bilderberg
[02:26:49.740 --> 02:26:52.420]  with Hillary Clinton when he was elected.
[02:26:52.420 --> 02:26:58.580]  No, I know, I was there. Imagine, it's one of the biggest stories in America. Where is
[02:26:58.580 --> 02:27:02.660]  Hillary? Where's Obama? They disappeared for a day. I'm there, Secret Service, Marines
[02:27:02.660 --> 02:27:11.500]  guarding him, Chantilly, Virginia. I call Fox, CNN, local channels. No one, no one covered
[02:27:11.500 --> 02:27:12.500]  it.
[02:27:12.500 --> 02:27:17.980]  No one covered it but the Epoch Times. And then I think Drudge linked to that, that there
[02:27:17.980 --> 02:27:22.100]  was a Bilderberg meeting. But Epoch Times was like, well, we don't know they're in there.
[02:27:22.100 --> 02:27:26.720]  I'm like, no, we have sources. No, the Secret Service drove by and aimed MP5 machine guns
[02:27:26.720 --> 02:27:34.620]  at us. Hillary and Obama are there. Imagine, you know where they are. The media knew too,
[02:27:34.620 --> 02:27:36.580]  but they didn't wanna show the Bilderberg meeting.
[02:27:36.580 --> 02:27:43.380]  So the media showed what good little minions they were. That's why they may have Bilderberg.
[02:27:43.380 --> 02:27:48.200]  It's always three years in Europe, one year in the US or Canada, North America. Now they
[02:27:48.200 --> 02:27:51.760]  may have it the same place this year because other media, they don't even have control
[02:27:51.760 --> 02:27:59.800]  in Europe. And people where there were literal torches in Switzerland. So again, America
[02:27:59.800 --> 02:28:07.100]  is so controlled that the only media that covered it this last year in Virginia was
[02:28:07.100 --> 02:28:15.060]  infoawards.com, prisonplanet.com, drudgerport.com, and Foreign News, London Guardian.
[02:28:15.060 --> 02:28:18.900]  But again, that's why the mainstream media has hardly any readers now. It doesn't matter
[02:28:18.900 --> 02:28:23.980]  if they lie and won't say it's happening. I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:28:23.980 --> 02:28:29.820]  Yeah, so it did appear that he vanished at that time. But I try to stress to people,
[02:28:29.820 --> 02:28:36.100]  it doesn't matter if it's Obama or if it's Romney is controlled under the same thing,
[02:28:36.100 --> 02:28:42.740]  these financiers and the finances and the bankers and they're controlling the politics
[02:28:42.740 --> 02:28:45.460]  and the military.
[02:28:45.460 --> 02:28:51.060]  And that's what I got to say about it.
[02:28:51.060 --> 02:28:59.620]  Hi, thank you for having me on. You're doing a wonderful thing, Mr. Jones. Hopefully we
[02:28:59.620 --> 02:29:05.060]  can follow you a lot more and do the rest. If you don't mind me giving just a little
[02:29:05.060 --> 02:29:11.540]  bit of two quotes from the Bible and then I will give you a thing. I would love it.
[02:29:11.540 --> 02:29:12.540]  Do I have your permission?
[02:29:12.540 --> 02:29:16.020]  Yeah, we're going to break in a minute, but just start your point now. Go ahead.
[02:29:16.020 --> 02:29:23.260]  OK, then, for thee ought to say, if the Lord will, we shall live and do this or that. But
[02:29:23.260 --> 02:29:29.900]  now ye rejoice in the boastings. All such rejoicing is evil. Therefore, to him that
[02:29:29.900 --> 02:29:39.660]  knoweth to do good and does not do it, to him it is sin. And now for my actual point,
[02:29:39.660 --> 02:29:43.620]  my wife is an illegal alien. I'm a U.S. citizen. Hold on. Stay there. I'm going to come back
[02:29:43.620 --> 02:29:47.040]  to you on the other side of this quick break. Get your take on that. Then I'll get to some
[02:29:47.040 --> 02:29:50.220]  news and more of your calls.
[02:29:50.220 --> 02:30:01.600]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN will warn you.
[02:30:01.600 --> 02:30:05.800]  Your freedoms are on the line. The Second Amendment is in danger. How soon before your
[02:30:05.800 --> 02:30:10.540]  freedoms are taken away? What can you not live without? What is your greatest dependency?
[02:30:10.540 --> 02:30:16.020]  Is it your guns? Is it your home? No, it's food. It all boils down to the food supply.
[02:30:16.020 --> 02:30:20.860]  Tyrannical governments control people by controlling their food supply. Don't be dependent. Be
[02:30:20.860 --> 02:30:25.340]  self-sufficient. Don't wait for the government to feed you. Feed yourself. I can warn you,
[02:30:25.340 --> 02:30:30.380]  but I can't feed you. Do like Alex has done and get a supply of food from e Foods Direct.

[02:33:17.380 --> 02:33:21.620]  need to get into some more of the news and then back into your calls. But we did find
[02:33:21.620 --> 02:33:29.340]  the I guess three minute video from 2006 with News Corp putting out an internal promo video
[02:33:29.340 --> 02:33:35.940]  to themselves about good job writers and workers. We're propagandizing people effectively.
[02:33:35.940 --> 02:33:39.980]  That's the thing with the public. I'm like, hey, the Department of Defense and the Department
[02:33:39.980 --> 02:33:44.900]  of Justice is paying to have anti-gun messages in TV shows. Yeah, right. Next you're gonna
[02:33:44.900 --> 02:33:52.580]  tell me there's horse meat in these TV dinners. Next you're going to tell me that aspartame
[02:33:52.580 --> 02:33:57.700]  is bad. Next you're going to say we might want to watch the government. Everybody knows
[02:33:57.700 --> 02:34:03.500]  you do whatever the government says. That's common sense. America was founded on socialism
[02:34:03.500 --> 02:34:13.260]  and the end of the family. Hi, I listen to NPR. Hi, I'm Janet Napolitano, head of Homeland
[02:34:13.260 --> 02:34:20.300]  Security. Trust no one but the government. So that's coming up. That can shut up long
[02:34:20.300 --> 02:34:27.820]  enough. Let's go ahead and go back to who was I just talking to Chad? Chad, go ahead,
[02:34:27.820 --> 02:34:32.180]  sir. You were saying your wife isn't illegal. Go ahead.
[02:34:32.180 --> 02:34:38.340]  Yeah, basically wanted to find out is my research into the Constitution and understanding it
[02:34:38.340 --> 02:34:43.420]  really our government only has the right to say if you're a citizen or not, not on the
[02:34:43.420 --> 02:34:47.100]  borders. And I do think that it is a thing that needs to be addressed and I'm not against.
[02:34:47.100 --> 02:34:53.220]  Well, here's the issue that because of sham marriages, they make it super hard. And if
[02:34:53.220 --> 02:34:56.620]  you're European, they make it almost impossible to immigrate here because they've got deals
[02:34:56.620 --> 02:35:01.300]  with Europe to keep good tax slaves there. They only bring in poor, uneducated workers,
[02:35:01.300 --> 02:35:06.100]  whether they be white, Hispanic, black, Asian from around the world to drive down wages.
[02:35:06.100 --> 02:35:12.220]  That's the main immigrant force. The corporations are clear on that. And to be a political arm.
[02:35:12.220 --> 02:35:15.660]  So I mean, if you're an illegal alien from Mexico and flaunt things are in the right
[02:35:15.660 --> 02:35:20.980]  group, you're above the law. But if you've got a woman you're really married to, what
[02:35:20.980 --> 02:35:25.300]  is it like five years it takes or whatever of you guys together last time I checked to
[02:35:25.300 --> 02:35:26.300]  really prove.
[02:35:26.300 --> 02:35:30.660]  Well, I mean, I'm sure you're an expert on it. I mean, you're married. It's really your
[02:35:30.660 --> 02:35:36.060]  wife. How long you been married? We've been married for seven years and definitely a very
[02:35:36.060 --> 02:35:41.060]  big witness to the sham of our immigration system. Because one of the reasons why we're
[02:35:41.060 --> 02:35:44.860]  having problems is the fact that we actually told the truth.
[02:35:44.860 --> 02:35:48.860]  And because of that, now we're this oddity case that we can't have anything go forward.
[02:35:48.860 --> 02:35:55.060]  No, of course. No, no, no, no. It's all done on purpose. The entire system is meant. If
[02:35:55.060 --> 02:35:58.500]  you walked in like Acorn or they've done it in social security offices and I'm running
[02:35:58.500 --> 02:36:01.780]  child slaves, I'm shipping them in crates bound.
[02:36:01.780 --> 02:36:05.060]  I want to give you part of that money. And they're like, hey, let's say I run the black
[02:36:05.060 --> 02:36:10.780]  up right now. Yeah, it's a fantastic job. Yeah, just make sure you got them in the school.
[02:36:10.780 --> 02:36:13.300]  These little kids are pimping out. How old are they? Oh, they're ten years old. Good.
[02:36:13.300 --> 02:36:15.180]  Yeah, we'll help you with that.
[02:36:15.180 --> 02:36:20.940]  As long as you're hardcore criminal gangster, you're going to Valhalla, son. I mean, this
[02:36:20.940 --> 02:36:25.700]  whole system is run by criminals for criminals. That's what I'm telling you. This isn't just
[02:36:25.700 --> 02:36:30.200]  rhetoric. The government's now converted to tyranny. They've got lots of Dudley Doo rights
[02:36:30.200 --> 02:36:35.420]  that, you know, write you tickets and, you know, take your kid or whatever.
[02:36:35.420 --> 02:36:42.360]  Who really think they're doing good for America? I hate lawbreakers. But meanwhile, the real
[02:36:42.360 --> 02:36:45.660]  lawbreakers are running things and I'm sorry to hear that's happened to you. So what's
[02:36:45.660 --> 02:36:46.660]  your final question?
[02:36:46.660 --> 02:36:53.220]  Well, my, my, my, actually it's a final statement of things to do. Really people go out and
[02:36:53.220 --> 02:37:00.700]  befriend everyone and even especially the law, the law enforcement and that to show
[02:37:00.700 --> 02:37:05.900]  them that you are human. You are a person. There is a reason for you to treat the globalist
[02:37:05.900 --> 02:37:10.460]  minions like they're a criminal and like when they've kidnapped a kid, you go, we love little
[02:37:10.460 --> 02:37:11.460]  Jenny.
[02:37:11.460 --> 02:37:16.100]  Here's her dog spot. Her grandmother is crying. She's a human being. Please, if you're, if
[02:37:16.100 --> 02:37:20.860]  you haven't killed her yet, please let her go. Just let her go. Now that works with some
[02:37:20.860 --> 02:37:25.540]  criminals who are kind of mentally ill and twisted. The psychopaths enjoy it more. But
[02:37:25.540 --> 02:37:30.400]  yeah, so begging them the wrong ones, they'll get all demonic looking and have a demon feed
[02:37:30.400 --> 02:37:32.540]  off of that, a psychic vampire feed.
[02:37:32.540 --> 02:37:37.100]  But some of them you can actually get to. But I notice a lot of them acting, you know,
[02:37:37.100 --> 02:37:42.660]  saying I'm human. They go, I know and I'm not. Because, you know, their spirit's going
[02:37:42.660 --> 02:37:47.540]  straight to hell. They're already in hell. They already love it.
[02:37:47.540 --> 02:37:53.600]  Not to fight, but to show, show that your character is of godly nature, that you love.
[02:37:53.600 --> 02:37:55.700]  But it does not mean that we do not fight this.
[02:37:55.700 --> 02:38:00.380]  Although the best thing to do, the best thing to do is fight the New World Order. Fight
[02:38:00.380 --> 02:38:07.460]  them, laugh at them, spit at them, degenerate filth and scum and ugly and weak. They'll
[02:38:07.460 --> 02:38:11.980]  be overrun in the end and they will fail. That's what you need to do. That's what they,
[02:38:11.980 --> 02:38:12.980]  because they already know it.
[02:38:12.980 --> 02:38:17.700]  They already know their place has been prepared. All right, I appreciate your call, Chad. All
[02:38:17.700 --> 02:38:21.740]  right, let's take one more while I settle down. One more while I settle down. Let's
[02:38:21.740 --> 02:38:24.580]  talk to Casey in Georgia. Casey, you're on the air.
[02:38:24.580 --> 02:38:26.620]  Hey, Alex. Hey, buddy.
[02:38:26.620 --> 02:38:34.300]  Let me get on speaker, one sec. All right. How you doing, partner?
[02:38:34.300 --> 02:38:39.580]  Yeah, I got a YouTube video about what happened to me last night. I'm going to say the title
[02:38:39.580 --> 02:38:43.900]  real quick. It's Georgia Car Lemon Fire.
[02:38:43.900 --> 02:38:44.900]  Well-
[02:38:44.900 --> 02:38:45.900]  Georgia Fire what?
[02:38:45.900 --> 02:38:49.420]  Oh, Georgia Car Lemon Fire.
[02:38:49.420 --> 02:38:51.940]  Georgia Car Lemon Fire.
[02:38:51.940 --> 02:38:53.060]  Georgia.
[02:38:53.060 --> 02:38:55.220]  Georgia Fire Lemon Fire.
[02:38:55.220 --> 02:38:59.100]  Oh, that's Georgia Car Lemon Fire. Sorry about that.
[02:38:59.100 --> 02:39:05.180]  That's almost like a brainwashing term. Georgia Fire Lemon Lemon. I'm sorry. All right, will
[02:39:05.180 --> 02:39:07.420]  you guys go find that? I'm sorry, go ahead, sir.
[02:39:07.420 --> 02:39:12.140]  All right, well anyway, this car caught fire right next to my convenience store last night
[02:39:12.140 --> 02:39:16.780]  and I was at my house and I rushed out with my fire extinguisher and I put it out. When
[02:39:16.780 --> 02:39:22.820]  I go spray it back a second time, the officer says, somebody grab that man, do you want
[02:39:22.820 --> 02:39:23.820]  to be arrested?
[02:39:23.820 --> 02:39:29.340]  Oh yeah, you don't have slaves. Pretty soon you'll be arrested for trying to wipe your
[02:39:29.340 --> 02:39:32.820]  own hind end and I'm not kidding. I mean, they would have toilet safety police if they
[02:39:32.820 --> 02:39:37.980]  could directly out of South Park. And that's the message of government. You're a lowdown
[02:39:37.980 --> 02:39:43.620]  scum. You're not allowed to protect yourself while your wife's being raped with your fist
[02:39:43.620 --> 02:39:45.540]  in England.
[02:39:45.540 --> 02:39:52.060]  If you fight the guy off, they will throw you in prison for a decade. And that's their
[02:39:52.060 --> 02:39:56.900]  message. Because they're criminals, at least the people you're dealing with. They have
[02:39:56.900 --> 02:40:02.800]  a criminal mindset. The nanny state doesn't let kids run at school now. Do you understand
[02:40:02.800 --> 02:40:05.780]  that? So tell us what happened.
[02:40:05.780 --> 02:40:10.820]  Well after that, I stepped back and I started filming and well, about 14 minutes into the
[02:40:10.820 --> 02:40:16.180]  video, he comes back up and he says that he's sorry. Well, he kind of says he's sorry in
[02:40:16.180 --> 02:40:23.340]  an imperious way. And he said, well, I told him I was well within my rights to put out
[02:40:23.340 --> 02:40:28.300]  that fire. It's going to burn down my family's store, our livelihood, our income. But more
[02:40:28.300 --> 02:40:31.060]  than that, I've been having trouble with the city here because my-
[02:40:31.060 --> 02:40:36.900]  How dare you try to run a business to pay them money, you filth. You filth. You filth.
[02:40:36.900 --> 02:40:37.900]  You filth.
[02:40:37.900 --> 02:40:38.900]  Yeah, we do get quite a bit of our money.
[02:40:38.900 --> 02:40:48.140]  They're going to get more too, boy. Obama going to do more. Anyway, so yes, we now see
[02:40:48.140 --> 02:40:53.380]  the video. Shot sideways, I like that camera angle, that's cinematic. Tell us what else
[02:40:53.380 --> 02:40:54.380]  happened.
[02:40:54.380 --> 02:40:59.140]  Well, not too much happened. Like I said, he comes up and he, there's a good little
[02:40:59.140 --> 02:41:03.700]  quote there, you might be able to make a meme out of somebody, but he comes up and he kind
[02:41:03.700 --> 02:41:09.300]  of apologizes and at the end of it all, we're all right. He's a local guy, but he was imperious
[02:41:09.300 --> 02:41:12.700]  and he wasn't in the right to tell me that he'd arrest me for putting out a fire on my
[02:41:12.700 --> 02:41:16.300]  own property. And I told him as such.
[02:41:16.300 --> 02:41:21.540]  Well, it's hard to believe that the progeny of people that carved out a continent might
[02:41:21.540 --> 02:41:29.100]  be able to put out a fire. Man, you're sick. What's wrong with you? Only someone in a uniform,
[02:41:29.100 --> 02:41:32.940]  nobody's thinking like to wear a uniform to be able to swim. I mean, literally be able
[02:41:32.940 --> 02:41:33.940]  to walk.
[02:41:33.940 --> 02:41:37.220]  It'll only people that have uniforms be able to walk. Maybe they'll chop our legs off at
[02:41:37.220 --> 02:41:42.940]  birth and say, only if your legs are chopped off, you know, or if you have a uniform, you're
[02:41:42.940 --> 02:41:44.900]  allowed to have legs. How's that sound?
[02:41:44.900 --> 02:41:50.420]  No, that's, well, I don't want, I'm never going to wear a uniform. So anyway, sir, do
[02:41:50.420 --> 02:41:53.660]  you have a license? Have you been properly trained to brush your teeth?
[02:41:53.660 --> 02:42:00.260]  No, I'm afraid not. I was just, I don't know, kindergarten they taught us that? That's the
[02:42:00.260 --> 02:42:01.260]  last time I remember that.
[02:42:01.260 --> 02:42:03.660]  So government did teach you how to do that?
[02:42:03.660 --> 02:42:04.980]  Oh, I guess you-
[02:42:04.980 --> 02:42:08.540]  What about picking your nose? They teach you that as well?
[02:42:08.540 --> 02:42:12.220]  No, that might have come from instinct, come from God.
[02:42:12.220 --> 02:42:16.140]  Man, this is evil, what I'm hearing right now. Whoa, you mean from the state, you just
[02:42:16.140 --> 02:42:17.140]  said God?
[02:42:17.140 --> 02:42:20.140]  No, no, no, not-
[02:42:20.140 --> 02:42:25.300]  Did you just engage in sacrilegious blasphemy? Did you just say the state wasn't God?
[02:42:25.300 --> 02:42:31.180]  No, no, no, not this guy. I know who I serve, I served you.
[02:42:31.180 --> 02:42:32.860]  Well there, that's why you're evil.
[02:42:32.860 --> 02:42:37.500]  Well anyway, the planning and zoning guy, just last year, he, one of my sister tried
[02:42:37.500 --> 02:42:42.820]  to pick up this house behind it. He said our property was condemned. He just said it was
[02:42:42.820 --> 02:42:47.560]  condemned and hoped we wouldn't fight it. But I bought it and I found out that they
[02:42:47.560 --> 02:42:51.740]  do this sort of informal condemnation where they just refuse to issue building permits.
[02:42:51.740 --> 02:42:57.300]  No, no, they're God. They take people's kids for not taking vaccines. There's no law. They
[02:42:57.300 --> 02:43:02.420]  forcibly inject kids with no law. Kid dies, they arrest you even though they know they
[02:43:02.420 --> 02:43:04.500]  killed your kid, cuz they're God.
[02:43:04.500 --> 02:43:09.620]  LA sends me letters going, we want $1,200 cuz somebody hung up an info war sign. And
[02:43:09.620 --> 02:43:12.740]  I'm like, well, what if it's an Obama sign? You're gonna charge him? I go, you don't have
[02:43:12.740 --> 02:43:17.140]  any citation, any proof that I did that, any fact. And they just go, okay, the fine's gonna
[02:43:17.140 --> 02:43:18.140]  double, well, good.
[02:43:18.140 --> 02:43:21.860]  And they're like, go ahead and sue us. We'll just use taxpayer money to pay it off. They
[02:43:21.860 --> 02:43:28.620]  don't care. They want to take everything down. It's all about they're in charge.
[02:43:28.620 --> 02:43:31.940]  Now the planning and zoning officer, he come from the Department of Community Affairs in
[02:43:31.940 --> 02:43:36.660]  Atlanta. And the Department of Community Affairs, when I was doing my research yesterday, they
[02:43:36.660 --> 02:43:40.700]  are the ones who give out the grants for them from the feds. They also are the ones who
[02:43:40.700 --> 02:43:45.020]  give out the grants for the fluoride, so I'm tempted to file open records pressed on them.
[02:43:45.020 --> 02:43:52.380]  Sir, the health departments were set up in the 1890s in England. And by 1900 here, Rockefeller
[02:43:52.380 --> 02:43:59.140]  Foundation, Carnegie Endowment, all of it. And it was set up for, quote, racial hygiene.
[02:43:59.140 --> 02:44:04.620]  And at the Nuremberg trials, about half the defense was quoting out of the Margaret Sanger
[02:44:04.620 --> 02:44:11.540]  Planned Parenthood, Eugenics Society, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, Rockefeller Brothers Foundation.
[02:44:11.540 --> 02:44:16.420]  Because the Nazis just did what they were taught to do. They just said Germans are only
[02:44:16.420 --> 02:44:22.980]  good, or Aryans, everybody else is dead. The globalists say everybody's dead. It's their
[02:44:22.980 --> 02:44:28.540]  job to make sure you get cancer and die. I know that sounds incredibly radical. It is,
[02:44:28.540 --> 02:44:29.540]  reality's crazy.
[02:44:29.540 --> 02:44:34.940]  Appreciate your call. Let's get to some news. Look at this article. I'm gonna cover this
[02:44:34.940 --> 02:44:39.300]  first cuz this ties into how we awaken, how we take America back. Sheriff responds to
[02:44:39.300 --> 02:44:44.460]  attacks. We have a document camera right on this bad boy right here for TV viewers. Right
[02:44:44.460 --> 02:44:46.580]  here is the document camera, thank you.
[02:44:46.580 --> 02:44:51.540]  Sheriff responds to attacks over Second Amendment comments. The American people will decide
[02:44:51.540 --> 02:45:00.620]  when to push back, not me. And here is the Milwaukee Journal, Sheriff David Clark defends
[02:45:00.620 --> 02:45:08.260]  appearance on conspiracy laden show. So now if we talk about our right, talk about the
[02:45:08.260 --> 02:45:13.380]  Bill of Rights, talk about the Constitution, neurotically document everything, this is
[02:45:13.380 --> 02:45:15.380]  a pejorative.
[02:45:15.380 --> 02:45:18.900]  This would be like 100 years ago saying, don't listen to that guy saying he's got rights
[02:45:18.900 --> 02:45:25.020]  and we cheated him. He's an N word. Or it'd be like in India with the untouchables. Don't
[02:45:25.020 --> 02:45:29.100]  listen to what that guy said. I didn't steal anything from him. He's an untouchable. He's
[02:45:29.100 --> 02:45:35.260]  a conspiracy theorist. He's somebody that isn't a chump. He's somebody that doesn't
[02:45:35.260 --> 02:45:39.500]  believe known liars. He's somebody that's informed. He's somebody that gets things done.
[02:45:39.500 --> 02:45:44.540]  He's somebody that built his own media empire. No, no, no, it's just, no, he's somebody that's
[02:45:44.540 --> 02:45:52.100]  broken thousands of big stories. No, he's just that nobody. And the Tea Party's dead
[02:45:52.100 --> 02:45:53.620]  and the Drudge Report's dead.
[02:45:53.620 --> 02:45:57.420]  I've been seeing that headline for ten years. The Drudge Report's dead as the traffic goes
[02:45:57.420 --> 02:46:01.580]  up and up and up as it gets more and more influential, the most influential. They have
[02:46:01.580 --> 02:46:05.340]  articles every week. Drudge Report's dead. Drudge Report's dead. Drudge Report's dead.
[02:46:05.340 --> 02:46:08.940]  Mark Twain's dead. Well, he is now, but back then, Mark Twain's dead. Mark Twain's dead.
[02:46:08.940 --> 02:46:13.500]  Rumors of my death have been greatly exaggerated. Alex Jones is dead. Alex Jones is discredited.
[02:46:13.500 --> 02:46:19.220]  Alex Jones is all over while we go straight up. They celebrate themselves. They're a bunch
[02:46:19.220 --> 02:46:25.980]  of con artists. So anyways, Sheriff David Clark defends appearance on conspiracy-laden
[02:46:25.980 --> 02:46:35.700]  show. See, and I love how the sheriff says, I didn't know I had to talk to you to be allowed
[02:46:35.700 --> 02:46:38.100]  to have an opinion or a view.
[02:46:38.100 --> 02:46:44.020]  Let me read from the Infowars.com story that's got the quote saying, you read the full article.
[02:46:44.020 --> 02:46:49.740]  Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clark Jr. has defended his comments on the Alex Jones show
[02:46:49.740 --> 02:46:54.220]  earlier this week under criticism from local reporters who said his remarks that strict
[02:46:54.220 --> 02:46:58.260]  gun legislation could lead to a second American Revolution were inflammatory, trying to take
[02:46:58.260 --> 02:47:01.340]  our guns as inflammatory, trying to blame us for dead kids as inflammatory.
[02:47:01.340 --> 02:47:04.540]  Looks like somebody ran somebody over with a tractor. You're gonna take all the John
[02:47:04.540 --> 02:47:10.260]  Deere tractors away? No, the tractor didn't do it. Clark told Jones listeners that he
[02:47:10.260 --> 02:47:15.260]  would consider any federal order to confiscate guns as an act of tyranny. He also said, I
[02:47:15.260 --> 02:47:20.100]  don't wanna get shot, he's not stupid, and said that he would refuse to enforce it in
[02:47:20.100 --> 02:47:21.840]  the county.
[02:47:21.840 --> 02:47:25.140]  You don't like this, do you, that we're now having this discussion, do you? See, we win,
[02:47:25.140 --> 02:47:28.740]  we force the initiative, we go on the offense and make you respond to us. You don't control
[02:47:28.740 --> 02:47:34.700]  reality anymore, you viper. Let's continue. I believe that if somebody tried to enforce
[02:47:34.700 --> 02:47:40.580]  something of that magnitude, you would see the second coming of an American Revolution,
[02:47:40.580 --> 02:47:47.240]  the likes of which would make the first revolution pale with comparison, the sheriff urged.
[02:47:47.240 --> 02:47:52.460]  That comment did not sit well with hacks at the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, who accused
[02:47:52.460 --> 02:47:59.620]  Clark of engaging in attention-grabbing media appearances on a conspiracy-peddling radio
[02:47:59.620 --> 02:48:06.460]  show. In a piece which we'll not link to, clearly designed to draw some much-needed
[02:48:06.460 --> 02:48:12.600]  readership from M4's audience, be nice, call Steve up and have him linked to that. I think
[02:48:12.600 --> 02:48:17.660]  it's comical to see him burning in flames politically. In a piece, the quote is on to
[02:48:17.660 --> 02:48:23.740]  draw some much-needed readership from M4's audience, one reporter makes several baiting
[02:48:23.740 --> 02:48:28.060]  remarks about Alex Jones while extensively quoting from our article on Sheriff Clark's
[02:48:28.060 --> 02:48:30.900]  comments earlier this week.
[02:48:30.900 --> 02:48:35.580]  She's the mainstream media that never links, we will link. I know why Steve did that, but
[02:48:35.580 --> 02:48:40.420]  it's a way to point that out. I get it's a literary flourish, but let's link to them.
[02:48:40.420 --> 02:48:44.340]  We don't know how long their publication will be around anyways. When the Sentinel reporter
[02:48:44.340 --> 02:48:48.900]  questioned Clark's appearance in his comments, the sheriff responded in an email stating,
[02:48:48.900 --> 02:48:53.380]  I don't know, I needed your approval. I love that, cuz they're like, why are you on the
[02:48:53.380 --> 02:48:54.380]  show?
[02:48:54.380 --> 02:48:57.900]  Well, I didn't know I needed your approval. When did people stop being entitled to their
[02:48:57.900 --> 02:49:03.040]  opinion, asked the sheriff. On the topic of the second revolution, comments Clark told
[02:49:03.040 --> 02:49:10.540]  the newspaper, I'm sure in 1776, the idea seemed way out there, too, at the time. And
[02:49:10.540 --> 02:49:14.660]  what a smart guy, man, I really like these sheriffs. These patriot sheriffs are like
[02:49:14.660 --> 02:49:16.140]  only talk shows.
[02:49:16.140 --> 02:49:22.900]  The sheriff wrote, the American people will decide when to push back, not me. That's right,
[02:49:22.900 --> 02:49:27.740]  that's right. You've been pushing on us long enough, New World Order, and we're sick of
[02:49:27.740 --> 02:49:32.500]  being pushed around. I don't care how many sitcoms, how many dramas, how many shows you've
[02:49:32.500 --> 02:49:35.420]  got demonizing red-blooded good people.
[02:49:35.420 --> 02:49:39.300]  Or how many times you say we killed the kids at Sandy Hook. Or how many times CNN says
[02:49:39.300 --> 02:49:43.580]  I supported Chris Dorner when everybody knows I didn't. Or how many times you say the US
[02:49:43.580 --> 02:49:50.300]  attacked Russia, that I said that, I didn't say that. You are discredited. Call me a conspiracy
[02:49:50.300 --> 02:49:52.780]  theorist cuz I know all your tricks.
[02:49:52.780 --> 02:49:57.900]  Call me that, call me that, call me that. Keep calling me that all day. I love it. That's
[02:49:57.900 --> 02:50:04.800]  only trick you got. People are a joke. I was interviewed by CNN poster Piers Morgan. Now
[02:50:04.800 --> 02:50:10.000]  there's a guy with some whacked out views, Clark also wrote an email. I've done dozens
[02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:13.740]  of interviews over the simple 30 second radio ad Clark told the Journal Sentinel.
[02:50:13.740 --> 02:50:21.700]  And folks, if the crime rate is going up in Milwaukee because of police being laid off
[02:50:21.700 --> 02:50:25.900]  and because they got gun control going on there. And he wants to keep the county safe.
[02:50:25.900 --> 02:50:28.540]  What do you say? You say, folks, time to get firearms training, protect yourself. I mean,
[02:50:28.540 --> 02:50:32.300]  that is no brainer. That should not be radical. That is common sense. But they wanna tell
[02:50:32.300 --> 02:50:33.300]  us we're radical.
[02:50:33.300 --> 02:50:36.480]  I mean, we've had people march up to us on the streets of Austin and say, you've got
[02:50:36.480 --> 02:50:41.820]  too many kids. It's happened in Whole Foods. It's like, listen, you're a radical jackass.
[02:50:41.820 --> 02:50:49.020]  Get out of my face. You sick freak cult member. You eugenics punk. Well, there are too many
[02:50:49.020 --> 02:50:53.640]  people that go home and blow your brains out. You don't do that. Go home and take a bunch
[02:50:53.640 --> 02:51:01.140]  of pills. You eugenics loving pieces of filth. Get out of my planet.

[02:52:04.960 --> 02:52:10.860]  In the US, one in every 50 homes will have a break in this year. Burglars call it smash

[02:54:16.960 --> 02:54:22.400]  This planet belongs to people that want to build a better civilization and have a great
[02:54:22.400 --> 02:54:26.800]  future for our progeny, who love life. And all of you that say it's your planet, you're
[02:54:26.800 --> 02:54:31.440]  protecting it by trying to reduce the population and trying to save the Earth. You're the people
[02:54:31.440 --> 02:54:35.620]  with all the open air genetic engineering, toxic waste dumping, all the super science
[02:54:35.620 --> 02:54:40.200]  experiments you're doing that may destroy the planet. I've studied it and you're the
[02:54:40.200 --> 02:54:41.200]  danger.
[02:54:41.200 --> 02:54:46.160]  Now this is from like five years ago, almost six years ago, a News Corp internal promo
[02:54:46.160 --> 02:54:54.520]  video bragging to their people how they're propagandizing everybody. So the public understands
[02:54:54.520 --> 02:55:00.720]  folks, everything you see, around 90% of it. There are some shows that are independently
[02:55:00.720 --> 02:55:05.240]  authorized to go out, and still those get taken over and twisted. Because I've been
[02:55:05.240 --> 02:55:11.140]  involved with them, conspiracy things like that, conspiracy theory with Ventura.
[02:55:11.140 --> 02:55:14.960]  And if something's good, they just won't let it air. So it's hard to get something good
[02:55:14.960 --> 02:55:21.040]  on air, but certainly most of it is paid for new world order trash. And here they are on
[02:55:21.040 --> 02:55:26.140]  the environmental front to scare everybody into global carbon taxes to fund the world
[02:55:26.140 --> 02:55:29.380]  government that's being openly announced again today.
[02:55:29.380 --> 02:55:34.560]  Here is News Corp, the folks demonizing the Tea Party. One host will be, the Tea Party's
[02:55:34.560 --> 02:55:39.880]  good, the other, no, they're bad. And then they'll laugh about, look, Jack Swaggart is
[02:55:39.880 --> 02:55:45.960]  saying the Tea Party's racist. And then just make it a joke. They're loyal opposition,
[02:55:45.960 --> 02:55:46.960]  here's that clip.
[02:55:46.960 --> 02:55:53.220]  I want to set an example to others in our industry and other industries that no matter
[02:55:53.220 --> 02:55:56.920]  what the size of your carbon footprint is, you can make a difference.
[02:55:56.920 --> 02:55:59.280]  How does that roll on record?
[02:55:59.280 --> 02:56:00.280]  Global warming.
[02:56:00.280 --> 02:56:01.280]  Probably.
[02:56:01.280 --> 02:56:05.280]  Press button to see what global warming will do in the next three years.
[02:56:05.280 --> 02:56:10.040]  Three years is a long ways away.
[02:56:10.040 --> 02:56:14.320]  What could we do on a practical level to start making a difference?
[02:56:14.320 --> 02:56:15.320]  To pay.
[02:56:15.320 --> 02:56:16.320]  Just had another thought.
[02:56:16.320 --> 02:56:17.320]  Megabank's one.
[02:56:17.320 --> 02:56:20.520]  What if The Scared Straight Show had a green message to it?
[02:56:20.520 --> 02:56:27.680]  The biggest thing we've done is inserting messages about the environment into some of
[02:56:27.680 --> 02:56:28.680]  our content.
[02:56:28.680 --> 02:56:29.680]  I don't follow.
[02:56:29.680 --> 02:56:32.400]  Green, it means environmentally friendly.
[02:56:32.400 --> 02:56:38.080]  The lifeblood of our company is the quality of our TV shows, and we would accomplish nothing
[02:56:38.080 --> 02:56:40.000]  if we compromised that quality.
[02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:43.520]  Going green doesn't fit with the rest of the show.
[02:56:43.520 --> 02:56:44.840]  Work your magic, make it fit.
[02:56:44.840 --> 02:56:50.880]  Hey Brian, I'm not going to recycle this aluminum can, I'm just going to throw it in the trash.
[02:56:50.880 --> 02:56:52.920]  Ha! You're Earth's bitch.
[02:56:52.920 --> 02:56:59.440]  The most powerful way that we could communicate the commitment on behalf of our company was
[02:56:59.440 --> 02:57:07.120]  to change the practices within the production, as well as work in a message about global
[02:57:07.120 --> 02:57:08.120]  warming.
[02:57:08.120 --> 02:57:09.120]  Alright, let's stop right there.
[02:57:09.120 --> 02:57:10.120]  Environmental changes and about.
[02:57:10.120 --> 02:57:12.320]  If I have time tomorrow, I'll play more of it.
[02:57:12.320 --> 02:57:16.480]  If you go up to Infowars.com, we're launching Operation Paul Revere, you got two more months
[02:57:16.480 --> 02:57:22.080]  to make your short film or long film, and win $115,000, but your entries are going to
[02:57:22.080 --> 02:57:27.200]  be featured on Infowars.com, on our YouTube channel, on the Nightly News, so it's a film
[02:57:27.200 --> 02:57:28.200]  festival.
[02:57:28.200 --> 02:57:32.700]  I mean, this is the equivalent of the Cannes Film Festival or something, it's so big.
[02:57:32.700 --> 02:57:35.400]  It will get media attention.
[02:57:35.400 --> 02:57:39.500]  Make a film about liberty and fighting tyranny, fiction, non-fiction, whatever.
[02:57:39.500 --> 02:57:44.400]  You can win $115,000, three prizes, $100,000, $10,000, $5,000.
[02:57:44.400 --> 02:57:48.680]  And then the top people that enter, even if you don't win, you get a shot at working at
[02:57:48.680 --> 02:57:56.080]  Infowars.com and Alex Jones producing your films, your feature films.
[02:57:56.080 --> 02:57:57.920]  So it's on.
[02:57:57.920 --> 02:58:02.840]  That's up at Infowars.com, huge online film festival launch, new special report, 20 minutes
[02:58:02.840 --> 02:58:05.460]  long with myself and David Knight.
[02:58:05.460 --> 02:58:07.440]  And it's also for people to follow the rules.
[02:58:07.440 --> 02:58:11.840]  We've got a lot of great entries, but most of them don't follow the basic rules that
[02:58:11.840 --> 02:58:12.840]  you can figure out.
[02:58:12.840 --> 02:58:17.320]  Of course, we'll get the very best entries right up.
[02:58:17.320 --> 02:58:21.460]  Got two more months, let me see, March and then April, April 30th, got to be in.
[02:58:21.460 --> 02:58:26.000]  I have two months to judge them, play them on air, play clips, and it's going to be very,
[02:58:26.000 --> 02:58:27.000]  very exciting.
[02:58:27.000 --> 02:58:33.720]  And part of that, Infowars.com forward slash contest, Infowars.com forward slash contest.
[02:58:33.720 --> 02:58:36.000]  And David Knight is hon showing the overall contest.
[02:58:36.000 --> 02:58:39.680]  I am judging it, but I'll also take the viewer's feedback.
[02:58:39.680 --> 02:59:00.360]  Thank you for listening to GCN, visit GCNlive.com today.
