[00:00.000 --> 00:10.600]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going
[00:10.600 --> 00:17.600]  to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe you got one!
[00:17.600 --> 00:41.600]  On the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:41.600 --> 00:54.520]  Many of us didn't see it yet in early 2020, but today millions of us are now aware of
[00:54.520 --> 01:00.880]  the emerging one world government and their deceitful plans to seize power hidden under
[01:00.880 --> 01:03.880]  the guise of world health.
[01:03.880 --> 01:10.240]  And many of us are now awake to the fact that this so-called new world order is religiously
[01:10.240 --> 01:17.880]  paganistic, luciferic, and satanic, so it's no surprise that their coronation ball climaxes
[01:17.880 --> 01:24.600]  on May 28th with a devil-horned moon and the Jupiter-Mars conjunction, which is believed
[01:24.600 --> 01:28.240]  to bring success when starting a war.
[01:28.240 --> 01:35.120]  Their big week of megalomania begins on May 22nd in Switzerland with both the World Health
[01:35.120 --> 01:41.440]  Organization's annual World Health Assembly and the World Economic Forum's annual meeting
[01:41.440 --> 01:42.440]  in Davos.
[01:42.440 --> 01:50.560]  In Geneva, the WHO will be voting on a pandemic treaty known officially as the Zero Draft
[01:50.560 --> 01:58.760]  Report of the Working Group on Strengthening WHO Preparedness and Response to Health Emergencies.
[01:58.760 --> 02:05.000]  This pandemic treaty will make them the Directing and Coordinating Authority on International
[02:05.000 --> 02:06.000]  Health.
[02:06.000 --> 02:14.840]  The WHO's Zero Draft Plan includes regular simulation exercises, global surveillance,
[02:14.840 --> 02:22.480]  more vaccines, more censorship, contact tracing, and digital vaccine passports.
[02:22.480 --> 02:29.600]  In Davos, Klaus Schwab's World Economic Forum's annual meeting theme is History at a Turning
[02:29.600 --> 02:30.840]  Point.
[02:30.840 --> 02:39.960]  Their agenda includes more vaccines, more censorship, and more LGBTQI resilience.
[02:39.960 --> 02:46.200]  The same week in Indonesia, the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction is holding
[02:46.200 --> 02:53.560]  their annual global platform where they will be planning for regular ongoing pandemic simulations,
[02:53.560 --> 02:59.320]  more global governance, more money to fight climate change, and ultimately accomplishing
[02:59.320 --> 03:06.120]  the United Nations 2030 agenda, also known as the Great Reset.
[03:06.120 --> 03:12.240]  After the New World Order's narcissistic coronation week ends with the Devil Horned Moon and
[03:12.240 --> 03:17.640]  the Jupiter-Mars conjunction, Klaus Schwab and his fellow Satanists can celebrate with
[03:17.640 --> 03:20.000]  their friends at CERN.
[03:20.000 --> 03:21.520]  And then what?
[03:21.520 --> 03:28.520]  In March of 2021, the Nuclear Threat Initiative conducted a tabletop exercise simulating a
[03:28.520 --> 03:35.760]  global pandemic involving a monkeypox terrorist attack, something that Bill Gates has told
[03:35.760 --> 03:37.600]  us to expect.
[03:37.600 --> 03:44.080]  The Biden administration has just bought millions of doses of monkeypox vaccines, and mysterious
[03:44.080 --> 03:47.320]  cases are now being reported.
[03:47.320 --> 03:54.800]  The final assault of the New World Order will involve a man-made bioattack, food shortages,
[03:54.800 --> 03:59.840]  FEMA camps, rolling blackouts, and endless riots.
[03:59.840 --> 04:07.280]  Violence may save your life someday, and it might save our freedom, but it's not a solution.
[04:07.280 --> 04:12.280]  If we really wanted to solve this problem, we could all peacefully convene at our local
[04:12.280 --> 04:17.920]  government council and demand either their allegiance to the Constitution or their immediate
[04:17.920 --> 04:19.720]  resignation.
[04:19.720 --> 04:24.480]  Because the New World Order is not going to surrender, and the entire U.S. government
[04:24.480 --> 04:27.140]  is under their control.
[04:27.140 --> 04:32.880]  This coming Memorial Day, remember and honor the ancestors who died for our freedom, because
[04:32.880 --> 04:34.840]  it may very well be our last.
[04:34.840 --> 04:40.240]  Here, we need a vast military-style campaign to marshal the strength of the global private
[04:40.240 --> 04:41.240]  sector.
[04:41.240 --> 04:48.080]  It offers the only real prospect of achieving fundamental economic transition.
[04:48.080 --> 04:50.680]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Rees.
[04:50.680 --> 04:55.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Sunday, May 22nd.
[04:55.480 --> 04:57.160]  We have breaking massive intel.
[04:57.160 --> 05:00.360]  Stay with us back in 60 seconds.
[05:00.360 --> 05:06.440]  Here at InfoWars, our slogan is, tomorrow's news today, whether it's politics, or health,
[05:06.440 --> 05:07.440]  or spirituality.
[05:07.440 --> 05:13.680]  We're about bringing you the very best documented, accurate, real-world information.
[05:13.680 --> 05:18.280]  And when it comes to our supplements, they are so game-changing for your body, for your
[05:18.280 --> 05:22.440]  health, your immunity, your libido, your middle clarity.
[05:22.440 --> 05:23.440]  They're incredible.
[05:23.440 --> 05:27.440]  And out of all the products, X2 is definitely the most amazing.
[05:27.440 --> 05:32.200]  It is the purest, highest-quality, atomic iodine you're going to find.
[05:32.200 --> 05:37.680]  Most other iodine out there is bound to other minerals and compounds, so you don't absorb
[05:37.680 --> 05:39.280]  it at all or fully.
[05:39.280 --> 05:42.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've got a limited supply, and it's been sold out for months
[05:42.920 --> 05:44.800]  because the supply chain right now is.
[05:44.800 --> 05:49.720]  But despite that, we're selling it at 25% off for one more week, then it goes back to full
[05:49.720 --> 05:50.720]  price.
[05:50.720 --> 05:53.720]  Within two weeks, the current sales rate is going to sell out.
[05:53.720 --> 06:00.720]  That's X2 for yourself today at InfowarsTour.com, X2 at InfowarsTour.com, take action now.
[06:23.720 --> 06:31.800]  This is a Sunday emergency broadcast, new global lockdowns imminent, a smoke screen for impending
[06:31.800 --> 06:36.600]  worldwide financial collapse, announcement of the new world order, the global cashless
[06:36.600 --> 06:38.280]  society control grid.
[06:38.280 --> 06:43.840]  Again, thank you so much for joining us on this live Sunday broadcast that was supposed
[06:43.840 --> 06:46.680]  to be taken off the air years ago.
[06:46.680 --> 06:47.680]  The global has failed.
[06:47.680 --> 06:52.120]  I'm going to be trying to be very calm today and get through all this news.
[06:52.120 --> 06:59.400]  I've done a lot of preparation for what I'm about to lay out, but let me just say this.
[06:59.400 --> 07:04.920]  All of this is completely transparent that the COVID-19 was produced in a lab, that this
[07:04.920 --> 07:10.600]  is a lab grown monkeypox, that they war game the last few years, having the next pandemic
[07:10.600 --> 07:17.200]  be a smallpox variant, monkeypox specifically, Bill Gates is there as if we're blind and
[07:17.200 --> 07:23.720]  stupid preparing the entire thing with the UN right as they meet trying to get countries
[07:23.720 --> 07:29.120]  to sign their sovereignty over in Switzerland next week to the World Economic Forum in the
[07:29.120 --> 07:30.120]  UN.
[07:30.120 --> 07:35.720]  Two weeks ago, the United Nations publicly merged with the World Economic Forum saying
[07:35.720 --> 07:40.440]  they will take corporate orders from the Bilderberg Group created organization.
[07:40.440 --> 07:45.880]  So we have lived to see the Bilderberg Group from being secret, with its world government
[07:45.880 --> 07:51.280]  depopulation aims to now having the World Economic Forum in control of the United Nations.
[07:51.280 --> 07:52.520]  Absolutely incredible.
[07:52.520 --> 07:57.800]  The New World Order is preparing their final attack.
[07:57.800 --> 08:02.960]  Now we have all the evidence of that we're going to be going over.
[08:02.960 --> 08:08.780]  Then we have the other prongs, the other heads of the Hydra, how they're coming after humanity
[08:08.780 --> 08:10.640]  for depopulation.
[08:10.640 --> 08:15.720]  And Bill Maher even saying they're targeting children with a transagenda to sterilize them.
[08:15.720 --> 08:17.680]  That's what it is.
[08:17.680 --> 08:21.440]  Within some Democrat-controlled areas, up to half the elementary students identifying
[08:21.440 --> 08:22.680]  as another sex.
[08:22.680 --> 08:27.680]  This is total brainwashing, total control, the end of our species as we know it.
[08:27.680 --> 08:30.520]  We have that information.
[08:30.520 --> 08:35.360]  Then we have Biden signing the $40 billion Ukraine aid package as U.S. stocks over the
[08:35.360 --> 08:38.560]  longest losing streak since the Great Depression.
[08:38.560 --> 08:43.840]  We're going to be looking at every different angle of this as even the UN has been running
[08:43.840 --> 08:49.760]  it and the World Economic Forum warn of the very worldwide food collapse they have engineered
[08:49.760 --> 08:55.600]  that we told you would happen 27 months ago when they initiated this phase of Agenda 2030,
[08:55.600 --> 09:00.280]  now that they have implemented Agenda 21.
[09:00.280 --> 09:05.480]  Also today, I'm going to cover this when we get into all this monkey pox lockdown 2.0,
[09:05.480 --> 09:09.680]  news the next segment, is that I've already read a lot of big studies.
[09:09.680 --> 09:14.840]  I've talked a lot of different sources, but I also have sources of individuals that have
[09:14.840 --> 09:18.880]  been the chief scientist at major pharmaceutical companies.
[09:18.880 --> 09:24.880]  I have sources right here in Austin that had up large biotech companies, genetic engineering
[09:24.880 --> 09:30.320]  companies, and I have sources that are some of the most prominent people in the liberty
[09:30.320 --> 09:34.520]  movement, the medical freedom movement, the anti-globalist movement that realize this
[09:34.520 --> 09:37.840]  is a global biomedical tyranny takeover.
[09:37.840 --> 09:41.440]  I've known this for over a year and a half, and Mike Adams wrote articles about it a year
[09:41.440 --> 09:47.400]  and a half ago at Natural News and showed the studies, but now I have talked to multiple
[09:47.400 --> 09:51.720]  individuals separately who have been to the major laboratories in the United States and
[09:51.720 --> 09:58.160]  Europe, and they name names, but we're not able to release it yet, where they have gone
[09:58.160 --> 10:06.160]  in and sequenced with billion-dollar equipment, CRISPR systems, what the spike protein is
[10:06.160 --> 10:14.040]  doing that has implemented the body via the Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and J&J injections.
[10:14.040 --> 10:16.800]  The J&J and AstraZeneca do it one way.
[10:16.800 --> 10:23.960]  They inject a virus with a DNA payload of different animals into your body and then
[10:23.960 --> 10:29.480]  orders your cells to make that part of your DNA that's passed on to the next generation.
[10:29.480 --> 10:33.840]  It's done similarly by affecting the outside of the cell and programming it to go to the
[10:33.840 --> 10:39.880]  nuclei with the mRNA injections, but what we know is, and this has already come out,
[10:39.880 --> 10:42.280]  I mean this is in the mainline medical literature.
[10:42.280 --> 10:48.520]  I showed this on Friday that, in fact, I think I just pulled that out of Friday's stack,
[10:48.520 --> 10:56.320]  it was just a bunch of big studies on chimpanzee and animal DNA in all of these injections,
[10:56.320 --> 11:04.280]  and also human DNA that they mix in to the other genetic code, RNA, DNA they're putting
[11:04.280 --> 11:11.600]  in, they then put in animal and human DNA into that, carrying other viruses and other
[11:11.600 --> 11:17.440]  payloads that will then be released, not just in this generation, but particularly in future
[11:17.440 --> 11:19.080]  generations.
[11:19.080 --> 11:23.720]  The spike protein alone is then absorbed because it has human and animal DNA attached
[11:23.720 --> 11:29.120]  to it, and then your body starts producing spike protein that gives you cancer, that
[11:29.120 --> 11:34.200]  destroys your fertility, that causes prion disease in the liver and the brain, and this
[11:34.200 --> 11:35.200]  is all admitted.
[11:35.200 --> 11:44.880]  So, it is now confirmed, ladies and gentlemen, that this is the kill switch being implemented
[11:44.880 --> 11:52.400]  into the very DNA of our bodies, and it particularly migrates into the ovaries and testicles.
[11:52.400 --> 11:54.920]  It's going to be incredible.
[11:54.920 --> 11:58.600]  This is the most important information we've ever covered, and I'll probably in a week
[11:58.600 --> 12:01.320]  or two say this is the most important because things are escalating.
[12:01.320 --> 12:06.040]  Twenty years ago, maybe once or twice, every few years I'd say this is the most important
[12:06.040 --> 12:07.040]  information.
[12:07.040 --> 12:12.280]  Now it's almost every day because it's all unfolding, and if we don't figure out what
[12:12.280 --> 12:15.400]  they're doing, and we have figured it all out from their own statements and plans, this
[12:15.400 --> 12:19.680]  broadcast has, and many of our guests have, and if we don't get that to the rest of the
[12:19.680 --> 12:23.760]  leaders in the world that don't know what they're facing, it's the end of humanity
[12:23.760 --> 12:25.160]  as we know it.
[12:25.160 --> 12:28.120]  This is not a dystopic science fiction horror movie.
[12:28.120 --> 12:31.720]  This is 2022 on the planet Earth.
[12:31.720 --> 12:33.440]  They're announcing world government.
[12:33.440 --> 12:38.920]  They're announcing global digital IDs to mine cell everywhere, from Italy to France to Germany
[12:38.920 --> 12:42.400]  to Australia to Canada.
[12:42.400 --> 12:45.920]  They are announcing just unbelievable information.
[12:45.920 --> 12:50.400]  We're going to cover every bit of it here today, and I'm going to host some in the third
[12:50.400 --> 12:55.080]  hour, and Owen Schreuer is going to be taking over with Sunday Live, 6 to 8 p.m., but I'm
[12:55.080 --> 12:58.280]  here every Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[12:58.280 --> 13:01.960]  We have some special documentaries we're going to air so much tonight, so much this
[13:01.960 --> 13:07.400]  afternoon, but this is 18 minutes of clips of myself in the last two years, going back
[13:07.400 --> 13:12.880]  to January of 2020 when they weren't even really hyping COVID yet, specifically predicting
[13:12.880 --> 13:18.040]  it with a racial immune system, specifically predicting that they would then bring out more
[13:18.040 --> 13:22.480]  viruses, particularly smallpox, specifically doing it, and how did I know?
[13:22.480 --> 13:26.080]  Because they run war games that are really the criminal battle plans of what they're
[13:26.080 --> 13:30.000]  going to do, so they get caught, they go, oh, it's just a drill.
[13:30.000 --> 13:33.480]  So we've learned how they operate, and I've had the former head of defense intelligence
[13:33.480 --> 13:36.120]  confirm our analysis, I've had many others confirm it.
[13:36.120 --> 13:38.040]  We know what we're talking about here.
[13:38.040 --> 13:39.040]  This is life and death.
[13:39.040 --> 13:43.960]  You can pretend you're part of the power structure, and be destroyed, or you can wake
[13:43.960 --> 13:47.000]  up and realize going along with this is living death.
[13:47.000 --> 13:48.000]  So this is an 18-minute clip.
[13:48.000 --> 13:50.920]  I'm just going to air two minutes of it as we go to break.
[13:50.920 --> 13:51.920]  It's on Band-Aid video.
[13:51.920 --> 13:52.920]  I hope you share it.
[13:52.920 --> 13:54.400]  It's life and death.
[13:54.400 --> 13:59.000]  Alex Jones predicted the monkeypox outbreak, and these are clips going back over two years
[13:59.000 --> 14:01.400]  right through the last week before it even happened.
[14:01.400 --> 14:02.400]  Here it is.
[14:02.400 --> 14:03.400]  We'll be right back.
[14:03.400 --> 14:11.240]  They plan to have smaller bio-weapon releases that aren't as deadly to get the global control
[14:11.240 --> 14:15.760]  system in place, and then have bigger releases, they're going to have limited bio-weapon releases
[14:15.760 --> 14:19.480]  at first that get us to then take vaccines that remove our immunity.
[14:19.480 --> 14:22.680]  They launch a simulant they own, they put vaccines in either of their binary weapons
[14:22.680 --> 14:26.800]  that lower your immunity, and then they start releasing the real stuff.
[14:26.800 --> 14:30.480]  And I believe they're going to launch a new bio attack, a whole separate virus, other
[14:30.480 --> 14:31.880]  than COVID very soon.
[14:31.880 --> 14:37.360]  Okay, this pandemic is ending, but a new one's coming soon when another super virus
[14:37.360 --> 14:38.360]  pops up.
[14:38.360 --> 14:41.880]  But you'll be trained to lock down, and then the next thing comes in a year or two, and
[14:41.880 --> 15:03.400]  then the next one, and then one hits its billions, and you all sit in your houses and die.
[15:03.400 --> 15:08.360]  We talk about how they plan to have smaller bio-weapon releases that aren't as deadly
[15:08.360 --> 15:13.440]  to get the global control system in place, and then have bigger releases than tightening
[15:13.440 --> 15:20.200]  the grip of global control during the larger depopulation events that happen, and then
[15:20.200 --> 15:25.160]  the deep state globally pretending it's the savior while it's actually organizing operation.
[15:25.160 --> 15:29.040]  And there are also binary weapons that we talked about yesterday, just a little bit,
[15:29.040 --> 15:33.640]  as this virus combines with what they're putting into the vaccine.
[15:33.640 --> 15:39.320]  Here, they can put DNA altering ingredients into the vaccines, and isn't it amazing they
[15:39.320 --> 15:40.840]  have the vaccine ready for this.
[15:40.840 --> 15:45.240]  At the same time, the outbreak happened, and they're going to roll out mandatory vaccines.
[15:45.240 --> 15:50.320]  When this becomes a panic in America, and by the way, the media is going to cause this
[15:50.320 --> 15:56.520]  to be a massive, massive panic among the public, but they're going to push people to mandatory
[15:56.520 --> 15:57.520]  vaccines.
[15:57.520 --> 15:59.360]  They're going to have an emergency order.
[15:59.360 --> 16:04.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, Ultra 12, the highest quality B12 you're going to find on the market,
[16:04.200 --> 16:08.040]  has been sold out for many months, but now it's back in stock at infowarstore.com.
[16:08.040 --> 16:12.640]  Now, in the next 45 seconds, I don't have time to get into vitamin B12, but do your

[17:08.320 --> 17:12.800]  And when it comes to information, boy, is that true today.
[17:12.800 --> 17:19.840]  We see the entire global corrupt into human depopulation, great recent combine, trying
[17:19.840 --> 17:26.560]  to collapse our society to build on its ashes, their transhumanist nightmare vision, suppressing
[17:26.560 --> 17:33.000]  the voices of good people all around the world, and of doctors and scientists and engineers
[17:33.000 --> 17:38.800]  that are exposing all their lives, their COVID hysteria, their world's gonna end in 2030,
[17:38.800 --> 17:41.720]  carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it.
[17:41.720 --> 17:46.880]  And none of it can succeed, none of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is
[17:46.880 --> 17:48.400]  silenced and gas lit.
[17:48.400 --> 17:52.680]  And that's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence.
[17:52.680 --> 17:56.920]  And that's why it's hard to share M4 Wars links and band up video links.
[17:56.920 --> 17:59.400]  That's why we've got to share them now more than ever.

[19:15.920 --> 19:19.760]  The bank that owns the mint that has started putting these out the last few years just
[19:19.760 --> 19:25.480]  sold out of 300,000 of a similar offering that was 40% more than what we're selling

[19:56.000 --> 20:23.120]  Visit infowarsstore.com today.
[20:23.120 --> 20:27.840]  And I've got so many breaking stories, the world government being announced, the biomedical
[20:27.840 --> 20:32.720]  tyranny, the UN takeover of all the major nations health care systems.
[20:32.720 --> 20:36.560]  Why they're accelerating this is to cover for global martial law ahead of the financial
[20:36.560 --> 20:42.960]  collapse and the new worldwide digital market, the beast system that's already been announced.
[20:42.960 --> 20:47.120]  Next hour I'm going to get into national news, picking it up, late night comics, attacking
[20:47.120 --> 20:52.360]  millions of views on YouTube and Twitter, taking very short clips out of what I said
[20:52.360 --> 21:01.960]  last week, out of context where I was showing news articles about fertility dropping, sperm
[21:01.960 --> 21:07.480]  counts dropping 90 plus percent, girls going into puberty at 3, 4, 5 years old from the
[21:07.480 --> 21:15.200]  chemicals, penis sizes shrinking all over the world wherever the globalists get control,
[21:15.200 --> 21:19.240]  it's tied into the chemicals in the water and what's in the vaccines and it's in studies.
[21:19.240 --> 21:25.680]  We showed all that on the, what was it, Wednesday show and the order went out, take that, edit
[21:25.680 --> 21:28.800]  it, don't show any of us proof and then make a joke about it.
[21:28.800 --> 21:33.040]  Well I'm going to show you the studies, I'm going to show you mainline news reporting
[21:33.040 --> 21:36.680]  on it next hour and then play what they edited.
[21:36.680 --> 21:41.400]  They know and they don't want you to know and they think it's funny.
[21:41.400 --> 21:44.960]  These are sick, evil people.
[21:44.960 --> 21:49.240]  Oh, they'll tell you in the New York Times it's happening but they won't tell you why
[21:49.240 --> 21:50.760]  it's happening.
[21:50.760 --> 21:54.200]  So that's coming up next hour and it's all part of the depopulation operation but they
[21:54.200 --> 21:59.360]  moved on from sterilence and the rest of it and feminizing men and ultra-feminizing women
[21:59.360 --> 22:06.400]  where they're going to puberty at age 5, they just moved on to genetically implanting in
[22:06.400 --> 22:13.080]  your cells with virus vector injections, we'll go over all the documents in the next segment
[22:13.080 --> 22:18.520]  and implanting something that basically gives you cancer and kills you and the record still
[22:18.520 --> 22:22.840]  bursts of babies of mothers that got injected with this in the months before with bloody
[22:22.840 --> 22:25.840]  sores all over them and the blood clots and the heart attacks and now they admit these
[22:25.840 --> 22:28.440]  shots can cause that and it's not rare.
[22:28.440 --> 22:32.240]  So this is all happening and they're just normalizing, killing everybody while they
[22:32.240 --> 22:37.160]  pose as a savers but I'm going to go back to the 18 minute synopsis that our great
[22:37.160 --> 22:47.960]  archive has put together in three hours. On Thursday I said I want to get a compilation
[22:47.960 --> 22:53.880]  together of where I laid out with the documents of the science, the new lockdowns, the new
[22:53.880 --> 23:01.640]  viruses they were released, specifically we got into smallpox, monkeypox and so there's
[23:01.640 --> 23:08.280]  an 18 minute synopsis of shows going back to January of 2020 over two years ago specifically
[23:08.280 --> 23:12.520]  laying out exactly what's happening, how do I do that? If you have that answer you'll
[23:12.520 --> 23:16.720]  have the answer. I'm not here with this knowledge trying to use it from my own game, believe
[23:16.720 --> 23:22.240]  me I have a rule I don't do that. I knew Joe Rogan was going to Spotify six months before
[23:22.240 --> 23:25.680]  he did but nobody else knew, he asked what I thought, you know, what was going on, should
[23:25.680 --> 23:31.040]  he do it and I didn't invest in Spotify, didn't tell my wife, didn't tell my family, didn't
[23:31.040 --> 23:36.320]  tell anybody, could have made hundreds of millions of dollars insider trading on that,
[23:36.320 --> 23:42.520]  the stock went up 47% in the month after he made the announcement because I don't use
[23:42.520 --> 23:45.960]  this knowledge for things like that, it's not bad if you know stuff like that and you
[23:45.960 --> 23:50.440]  used it, it's that I have a rule that I can't be like Congress that knows what they're
[23:50.440 --> 23:52.880]  going to pass and what they're going to fund and what they're going to do and then they
[23:52.880 --> 23:56.720]  use it for their own personal gain and say they're allowed to insider trade, when they
[23:56.720 --> 24:02.160]  do an insider trading, if I have information and use it, it's not but I still don't do
[24:02.160 --> 24:10.120]  it because I want to be pure, I own no stock, no bonds, nothing even though I could use
[24:10.120 --> 24:15.880]  all this knowledge to be a billionaire because that's what the Holy Spirit tells me to do
[24:15.880 --> 24:24.480]  so I can be absolutely only beholden to God and you. This 18 minute compilation is beyond
[24:24.480 --> 24:30.120]  bombshell, I'm going to have it added to the live show feed today with the live show
[24:30.120 --> 24:36.120]  headline up there dealing with lockdown 2 and what they're planning on the economic
[24:36.120 --> 24:41.120]  collapse that we're already in the middle of but I'm going to play now going out to
[24:41.120 --> 24:47.960]  break just five minutes of this, four and a half minutes of this so you will then go
[24:47.960 --> 24:53.120]  to band.video but you can't share that URL, they're blocking it on Twitter and Facebook
[24:53.120 --> 24:58.640]  the rest of it but we'll give you a new URL when we come back, we had battleplan.news
[24:58.640 --> 25:01.920]  now they're blocking that but we have a new one, we'll put it up on screen in a moment
[25:01.920 --> 25:08.440]  and you can see it for yourself and they're trying to keep you from this information,
[25:08.440 --> 25:14.280]  why because if you know this they can't destroy you, they've stolen the world through fraud,
[25:14.280 --> 25:18.560]  they've taken over and now they want you and my shell everybody else out of the way, we're
[25:18.560 --> 25:23.600]  useless eaters, we're non-essential so ladies and gentlemen, here's a little bit more from
[25:23.600 --> 25:27.720]  this clip that's on band.video that we're going to make the featured video on band.video
[25:27.720 --> 25:34.280]  Alex Jones predicted the monkeypox outbreak, learn what's coming next from 27 months ago,
[25:34.280 --> 25:41.560]  26 months ago, no, no, how many, 28 months ago, 29, learn what's coming next from two
[25:41.560 --> 25:46.160]  plus years ago, from then learn what's coming next because everything I said has come true
[25:46.160 --> 25:50.640]  to a point now that the rest is happening, only 100,000 views on the video, it needs
[25:50.640 --> 25:54.240]  50 million, here's a few more minutes of it.
[25:54.240 --> 26:00.400]  Remember, they can put DNA altering ingredients into the vaccines and isn't it amazing they
[26:00.400 --> 26:04.160]  have the vaccine ready for this at the same time the outbreak happened and they're going
[26:04.160 --> 26:10.000]  to roll out mandatory vaccines when this becomes a panic in America and by the way, the media
[26:10.000 --> 26:15.400]  is going to cause this to be a massive, massive, you know, panic among the public but they're
[26:15.400 --> 26:20.640]  going to push people to mandatory vaccines, they're going to have an emergency order maybe
[26:20.640 --> 26:24.520]  by the president, I don't know, I don't know if he's going to stop this, he's not stopping
[26:24.520 --> 26:27.800]  the tech censorship, I don't know what he's going to do but they're going to have mandatory
[26:27.800 --> 26:33.000]  vaccines and the vaccines will be the second half of the binary weapon.
[26:33.000 --> 26:37.040]  This is euthanasia via vaccination.
[26:37.040 --> 26:41.880]  I don't believe this is the big one, they need to have a virus that's deadly but not
[26:41.880 --> 26:45.920]  ultra deadly to get everybody under world government, everybody used to being forcibly
[26:45.920 --> 26:52.880]  inoculated in quarantines and shutdowns and these systems of total control.
[26:52.880 --> 26:58.280]  The globalists are testing right now our response to see if they can lock us down and then if
[26:58.280 --> 27:03.360]  we lock down properly, then they're going to release the real bio version that'll then
[27:03.360 --> 27:08.480]  start wiping out even more so this is a test for the global depopulation operation.
[27:08.480 --> 27:13.360]  It's 2020 and they're gearing up to exterminate you and your family.
[27:13.360 --> 27:19.160]  It came out of Wuhan, China incubated this and then deployed it worldwide.
[27:19.160 --> 27:22.160]  Well absolutely and they're not done, this is just the first wave.
[27:22.160 --> 27:27.640]  So you hinted at this earlier, this is a softening up phase for America, there is a much more
[27:27.640 --> 27:30.040]  virulent strain that will be released.
[27:30.040 --> 27:33.360]  And it's an opening salvo of a larger role and it really all crystallized for me doing
[27:33.360 --> 27:36.880]  deep research last night this morning and talking to you and I think you just picked
[27:36.880 --> 27:40.360]  up where I was going without me even telling you, I think you're starting to incur with
[27:40.360 --> 27:45.680]  me as we brainstorm here that this is a opening salvo and something much larger.
[27:45.680 --> 27:46.680]  Absolutely it is.
[27:46.680 --> 27:50.600]  There's no question and it depends on how Trump responds to this.
[27:50.600 --> 27:54.080]  And there's also evidence that it's also a binary weapon that you've got to have other
[27:54.080 --> 27:56.920]  things in the environment for it to be triggered.
[27:56.920 --> 28:01.560]  Now remember this will blow over, it'll have hundreds of thousands of deaths, whatever,
[28:01.560 --> 28:05.200]  but you'll be trained to lock down and then the next thing comes in a year or two and
[28:05.200 --> 28:09.800]  then the next one and then one hits its billions and you all sit in your houses and die.
[28:09.800 --> 28:16.760]  Everybody just better button up and realize it's not the virus you've got to worry about,
[28:16.760 --> 28:22.200]  but you better be concerned because the virus is the cover for what's coming next.
[28:22.200 --> 28:27.640]  Look, I've told you this for several years and back in the fall we put up every day the
[28:27.640 --> 28:34.800]  man in a spacesuit at a national park at Yosemite National Park and I said that's the future,
[28:34.800 --> 28:38.360]  they're going to make it impossible to live normally on this planet, they're going to
[28:38.360 --> 28:42.480]  have limited bio weapon releases at first that get us to then take vaccines that remove
[28:42.480 --> 28:43.480]  our immunity.
[28:43.480 --> 28:50.000]  Oh I can tell you this is the drill and then we go on to specifically lay out that they're
[28:50.000 --> 28:54.360]  going to release the monkeypox, we'll be right back stay with us infowars.com, tomorrow's

[30:29.320 --> 30:30.320]  has never gone up.

[33:01.160 --> 33:20.840]  Including a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:20.840 --> 33:27.400]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well
[33:27.400 --> 33:33.600]  so does he. Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:33.600 --> 33:39.120]  To an emergency Sunday broadcast, new global lockdowns imminent as smokescreen for a pending
[33:39.120 --> 33:48.040]  worldwide financial collapse announcement of the New World Order. We're laying out exclusive
[33:48.040 --> 33:52.840]  whistleblower information confirming that so-called COVID vaccines permanently mutate the human
[33:52.840 --> 34:01.440]  genome by implanting sterilization and cancer causing spike proteins into the human genome
[34:01.440 --> 34:10.440]  system, literally implanting a kill switch in future generations. It is all coming up
[34:10.440 --> 34:15.280]  here today, ladies and gentlemen. But I want to put on screen for people one more time
[34:15.280 --> 34:21.240]  if we can. The video that I just played a few excerpts of that is a compilation of
[34:21.240 --> 34:27.720]  clips in the last almost two and a half years laying out what is now unfolding. Alex Jones
[34:27.720 --> 34:32.920]  predicted the monkeypox outbreak. But you can't share Band-Aid video on most platforms
[34:32.920 --> 34:38.280]  because of the censors and the Ministry of Truth. But you go to directly Band-Aid video
[34:38.280 --> 34:42.960]  and use your email or your text message or your word of mouth. Or you can also use the
[34:42.960 --> 34:48.040]  New URL. We had Battleplan.News for a few months. They've now banned that. The New URL, they
[34:48.040 --> 34:53.680]  might ban it a week or six months. We don't know. Theinfowar.tv is right up there in the
[34:53.680 --> 35:02.640]  corner of the screen. You can see it right there. Theinfowar.tv. There it is. Share
[35:02.640 --> 35:07.840]  that everywhere. This is a literal information war. They cannot win unless they can censor
[35:07.840 --> 35:12.440]  us and control us. The last two and a half years was a beta test. Now they're going into
[35:12.440 --> 35:21.360]  their full operation against everybody. Okay. Look at all these articles laying out here.
[35:21.360 --> 35:25.200]  This is not a prop to make it look like I've got a bunch of research. We actually have gone
[35:25.200 --> 35:29.760]  over these articles. Every one of these stacks is incredibly important and I'm going to start
[35:29.760 --> 35:39.120]  plowing through them right now. The good news is people have figured this out. My inbox
[35:39.120 --> 35:44.000]  is full. My phone is ringing off the hook. You can go to Instagram, Facebook, Twitter,
[35:44.000 --> 35:50.960]  not just Gab, not just Rumble, not just infowars.com. But you can go anywhere and it's just flooded
[35:50.960 --> 35:55.000]  with people going, look at this timeline. And people have done all these amazing timelines
[35:55.000 --> 36:00.320]  that have links to the announcements and the documents from the Davos Group, from the UN,
[36:00.320 --> 36:05.440]  from Bill Gates, from the Carnegie Endowment, from the Rockefeller Foundation, where they
[36:05.440 --> 36:18.240]  wore a game specifically monkeypox and then martial law being brought in. So you wonder
[36:18.240 --> 36:23.440]  what came after COVID when you're not scared of that anymore? Well, here comes the monkeypox.
[36:23.440 --> 36:29.960]  And many of the symptoms of monkeypox is exactly what the so-called vaccines cause, all sorts
[36:29.960 --> 36:35.640]  of blisters and red bloody spots all over your body. You know that. They admit that that
[36:35.640 --> 36:42.920]  is all going on. So now monkeypox is in 83 countries magically and they don't know how
[36:42.920 --> 36:47.680]  it happened. Well, we do, ladies and gentlemen. I'm going to show you articles. I'm going
[36:47.680 --> 36:52.040]  to move quick. Later, this will be archived at Band-Aid Video. You can pause the video,
[36:52.040 --> 36:55.640]  write it down, look it up, read it. I've spent a lot of time on this because it's about to
[36:55.640 --> 37:00.480]  lock you down. It's about to make you non-essential. It's about to bankrupt you and then they'll
[37:00.480 --> 37:06.200]  have the next wave that kills us or more of us. This is a plan. Remember, I'm not just
[37:06.200 --> 37:11.080]  saying it now, not just tailoring what's currently happening to my view. We already predicted
[37:11.080 --> 37:17.080]  it with our own documents, everything that's happening now. Key article. Learn how Bill
[37:17.080 --> 37:22.520]  Gates knew about the monkeypox outbreak and the new global pandemic lockdown. Go read
[37:22.520 --> 37:26.680]  it. It's on infowords.com. See the videos. Everything we say, we have a clip. We have
[37:26.680 --> 37:33.800]  a document. Everything we say. Another key report by Kelly McBrane, infowords.com. 2021,
[37:33.800 --> 37:39.360]  who and Gates Foundation exercise portrayed global monkeypox pandemic killing millions
[37:39.360 --> 37:45.320]  used to bring in a UN treaty to take over national sovereignty and all of our healthcare.
[37:45.320 --> 37:50.960]  It's all there. Again, if you're planning a bio attack, your own employees can spy on
[37:50.960 --> 37:56.440]  you. They can blackmail you. They can expose you. But if it's all done as a drill and a
[37:56.440 --> 38:02.320]  tabletop exercise, well, it's just a drill. Oh, that's fiction that I was planning to
[38:02.320 --> 38:06.760]  rob the bank. It doesn't matter the fiction matches what happened in the bank robbery.
[38:06.760 --> 38:12.640]  See how it works. Very important report on infowords.com. I suggest you share it if you
[38:12.640 --> 38:19.280]  want to live. Bombshell report. Monkeypox appears to be lab stream with unknown characteristics.
[38:19.280 --> 38:24.320]  Of course, they souped it up. It says CDC source, ECD source. Go read that article in
[38:24.320 --> 38:31.560]  infowords.com. Jamie White. And right on time. Told you over a week ago they do this. Belgium
[38:31.560 --> 38:37.880]  begins monkeypox quarantines. Biden warns everybody should be concerned. Anybody with
[38:37.880 --> 38:42.760]  a blister or anything. Oh, it's not a fever blister. It's monkeypox. You're locked up.
[38:42.760 --> 38:46.340]  They don't of course tell you there's a bunch of drugs that totally cure it in hours. World
[38:46.340 --> 38:50.880]  health organization warns monkeypox could accelerate during the summer. Oh, perfect
[38:50.880 --> 38:58.800]  times to the midterms. CDC alerts US doctors as virus reaches 13 countries. Belgium becomes
[38:58.800 --> 39:05.400]  first country to introduce compulsory monkeypox quarantine. Bolsonaro Brazil rejects WHO's
[39:05.400 --> 39:13.880]  pandemic treaty. Brazil is autonomous. Beautiful. We need more of that. Monkeypox war games
[39:13.880 --> 39:21.640]  and vaccine side effects. Very important. Five minute report will air next segment that
[39:21.640 --> 39:31.360]  is so critical. Archbishop Viano warns nations of World Health Organization's UN pandemic
[39:31.360 --> 39:36.680]  treaty power grab yielding sovereignty is considered the crime of high treason. And
[39:36.680 --> 39:40.520]  that's what the new world order is. Then of course, we played the clips on Friday, but
[39:40.520 --> 39:45.400]  Bill Gates in November of 2021 said it's imminent. The monkeypox is coming. Give up all your
[39:45.400 --> 39:50.400]  rights. He will save you and Biden already bought the monkeypox vaccine. Six months ago
[39:50.400 --> 40:00.280]  it was delivered this week. Total complete absolute coordination. Biden on monkeypox outbreak
[40:00.280 --> 40:06.920]  should concern everybody as health experts are baffled. How could it pop up in 83 countries
[40:06.920 --> 40:14.280]  overnight? Magically, no one knows. Oh, now it's sex just like HIV. No, it's the injections.
[40:14.280 --> 40:20.600]  Monkeypox goes global. Why scientists are on alert. Meanwhile, Judge orders Biden to
[40:20.600 --> 40:26.160]  keep Title 42 barrier. All it is is a limited Ellis Island check if they catch you to make
[40:26.160 --> 40:32.440]  sure you don't have diseases. Biden was going to waive that, but New York, LA and others
[40:32.440 --> 40:39.400]  are re implementing mask. Getting ready for lockdowns. When you're in the country, oh,
[40:39.400 --> 40:43.720]  you can't go to mass gatherings. They're saying already, but the border, it stays wide open,
[40:43.720 --> 40:49.520]  but a judge orders Biden to keep title 42 barrier. And I mentioned this is happening
[40:49.520 --> 40:54.960]  all over the world, but feds consider that's the feds in Canada, digital identity and facial
[40:54.960 --> 41:01.080]  recognition for air travel on the back of COVID-19. Now monkeypox. Okay, they're not scared of
[41:01.080 --> 41:06.440]  COVID now. Well, let's give them a monkeypox will accept the global ID. We've got a bunch
[41:06.440 --> 41:13.840]  of slides and a bunch of documents that go through all this and lay it out. But Marco
[41:13.840 --> 41:19.000]  Rubio came out and said, how do we tell American citizens if you test positive for anything,
[41:19.000 --> 41:22.840]  you can enter your own country. But if you are arriving illegally, whether you test positive
[41:22.840 --> 41:30.200]  or not, you say the magic words and you get in to the United States. Sweden now joins
[41:30.200 --> 41:34.120]  other countries in classifying monkeypox as a disease dangerous to public health, allowing
[41:34.120 --> 41:38.080]  the government to impose measures and restrictions to stop the spread of infection kills maybe
[41:38.080 --> 41:43.480]  one out of a thousand. But the UN only counts those that almost died or died in their statistics.
[41:43.480 --> 41:48.880]  So it's one out of 10 more fraud likely seen over and over and over and over and over and
[41:48.880 --> 41:56.400]  over again. So this is quite a time to be alive. I can't believe it's monkeypox season
[41:56.400 --> 42:02.760]  already. I still have my Ukraine decorations up. That's right. And then, of course, we
[42:02.760 --> 42:08.560]  have the head of Pfizer saying imagine the compliance. Pfizer CEO pitches debos elites
[42:08.560 --> 42:14.400]  on Wi Fi microchip swallable vaccines that are live vaccines and whereas a chip in the
[42:14.400 --> 42:21.680]  pill to make sure you took it. And it goes on from there. Remember what Robert F Kennedy
[42:21.680 --> 42:28.000]  Jr said? The CDC is not an independent agency. It's a vaccine company. The CDC owns over
[42:28.000 --> 42:36.320]  20 vaccine patents. It sells about $4.6 billion of vaccines every single year. And there's
[42:36.320 --> 42:42.720]  a breakdown how they laid out the whole timeline and prepared it. All right. All right, we've
[42:42.720 --> 42:48.200]  got so much to cover when we return and how they're recycling the same propaganda from
[42:48.200 --> 42:53.480]  shingles caused by the so called vaccines, even using the same photos to say that's been
[42:53.480 --> 42:57.720]  caused by monkeypox. Stay with us. We'll be right back.
[42:57.720 --> 43:04.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, there are a lot of natural compounds out there that turbo charge and
[43:04.160 --> 43:10.520]  boost our stamina, our energy, our libido that are also amazing pre or post workouts.
[43:10.520 --> 43:15.520]  And we went out and looked at the top brands, the top reviews and came out with alpha power.
[43:15.520 --> 43:20.400]  Now it's so hard to source good, clean herbs like we have in this, that it's been sold
[43:20.400 --> 43:25.760]  out for more than six months. But now alpha power is back in stock at infowarshore.com

[44:07.000 --> 44:11.640]  and the fact that we're not caught flat footed during their major takeover is because of
[44:11.640 --> 44:17.040]  you. Humanity has a real fighting chance. I just want to thank you all for buying products

[45:03.480 --> 45:08.840]  that supplies the Pentagon, the military, the CIA, the FBI, you name it, with super

[45:14.640 --> 45:19.960]  desktops. This is so critical, ladies and gentlemen. Going into the future with contact
[45:19.960 --> 45:24.200]  tracers and the new world order, everything is about tracking you and your family. And
[45:24.200 --> 45:28.640]  we have this high quality Made America product line exclusively available, private labeled
[45:28.640 --> 45:37.000]  by us, known as Redux at infowarshore.com. So go to infowarshore.com and check out Redux.
[45:37.000 --> 45:41.880]  It's our first big run. We've made a major investment to have this produced and ready

[45:52.800 --> 45:57.000]  it, with Redux exclusively available at infowarshore.com.
[45:57.000 --> 46:01.600]  With the world awakening, I think what's important that we were right there for a message right
[46:01.600 --> 46:05.880]  now, take advantage of this moment and I have an idea that something everybody can do with
[46:05.880 --> 46:10.320]  every listener can do. I think it'd be powerful and effective for us to, you know, hang banners
[46:10.320 --> 46:15.160]  over highways. Imagine a champion, an artist, a leader, a man that says Alex Jones is right
[46:15.160 --> 46:19.280]  in the workshop corner. We stand with the tracers, or rest out, or whatever it is.
[46:19.280 --> 46:23.400]  Brother, I'm so glad you called, elaborate on this. Yes. Now is the time in your small
[46:23.400 --> 46:27.560]  town or your big city to write something on the bathroom wall or to put a sticker on
[46:27.560 --> 46:33.520]  your car or banner hangs over highways and it will be a chain reaction. What do you recommend
[46:33.520 --> 46:34.920]  people say on these banner hangs?
[46:34.920 --> 46:41.800]  I have a few ideas. First of all, I'll stress the fact that the vaccine is poison. There's
[46:41.800 --> 46:44.240]  kinds of things. I said, just keep it short. Keep it concise.
[46:44.240 --> 46:49.000]  I agree. Arrest Fauci, arrest Bill Gates. The COVID-vaxx is poison. Beautiful.
[46:49.000 --> 46:52.520]  Yeah. There's ways that we could all be involved if we could all be effective though. That's
[46:52.520 --> 46:53.520]  what I'm calling about.
[46:53.520 --> 46:57.760]  God bless you, Chris. In Atlanta, I really, really appreciate you calling us today. Thank
[46:57.760 --> 47:01.440]  you so much.
[47:01.440 --> 47:13.480]  Waging a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones. Waging War
[47:13.480 --> 47:21.840]  on Corruption, it's Alex Jones. Coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[47:21.840 --> 47:30.960]  In 1980, smallpox was declared eradicated by the World Health Assembly. After 9-11,
[47:30.960 --> 47:34.200]  however, concerns over bioterrorism attacks increased.
[47:34.200 --> 47:40.400]  We also face a new threat that the next epidemic has a good chance of originating on a computer
[47:40.400 --> 47:46.080]  screen of a terrorist intent on using genetic engineering to create a synthetic version
[47:46.080 --> 47:53.480]  of the smallpox virus for a contagious and highly deadly strain of flu.
[47:53.480 --> 48:01.160]  And have since led the U.S. FDA to fully approve two brand-new smallpox vaccines, ACAM2000 and
[48:01.160 --> 48:07.360]  Gineos. The U.S. national stockpile also includes a third vaccine for smallpox called APSV,
[48:07.360 --> 48:12.040]  an investigational replication-competent vaccine which could potentially be made available
[48:12.040 --> 48:20.720]  under emergency authorization. ACAM2000 was approved by the FDA in 2007. As of 2019, ACAM
[48:20.720 --> 48:25.880]  has been limited for use primarily in U.S. military and DOD personnel due to the safety
[48:25.880 --> 48:31.640]  risks, which include becoming infected with the vaccine-zoned virus, vaccine shedding,
[48:31.640 --> 48:32.640]  and death.
[48:32.640 --> 48:38.160]  Package insert also includes a number of warnings and precautions, including a blackbox
[48:38.160 --> 48:43.480]  warning for the serious adverse events which are listed here and which we'll describe
[48:43.480 --> 48:46.200]  in a little bit more detail in a further slide.
[48:46.200 --> 48:51.600]  The CDC's own website also states that the risk of ACAM side effects and household contacts
[48:51.600 --> 48:56.720]  is the same as those for the vaccine recipient. Another pandemic of the vaccinated.
[48:56.720 --> 49:01.640]  Now let's move on to Gineos, the vaccine most recently approved for both smallpox
[49:01.640 --> 49:07.160]  and monkeypox. We look here to the FDA's biologics license application review. In
[49:07.160 --> 49:12.360]  this 213-page memorandum, you'll find that its effectiveness was only inferred using
[49:12.360 --> 49:18.120]  the immunobridging process to compare it with ACAM. As of 2019, it has only approved for
[49:18.120 --> 49:23.560]  those who are determined to be at high risk of either smallpox or monkeypox. This vaccine
[49:23.560 --> 49:29.720]  also goes by the name of Infinex in Europe and Infamune in Canada. In addition to the
[49:29.720 --> 49:33.880]  vaccines, both the U.S. and U.K. governments have been preparing for a monkeypox outbreak
[49:33.880 --> 49:40.040]  using tabletop scenario wargames, similar to Event 201. The Nuclear Threat Initiative,
[49:40.040 --> 49:45.480]  or NTI, prepared for such an event in the spring of 2021 using a genetically modified
[49:45.480 --> 49:51.280]  monkeypox scenario. This event even included some of the same players from Event 201. This
[49:51.280 --> 49:56.920]  year's NTI tabletop exercise featured a bioweapons attack against cattle, which would prepare
[49:56.920 --> 50:02.840]  them for, let's say, a virus outbreak at the new BSL4 agriculture lab in Kansas. The
[50:02.840 --> 50:07.960]  U.K. Ministry of Defense recently used Conductor to play out how they would react to Russian
[50:07.960 --> 50:13.160]  disinformation during a monkeypox outbreak. Conductor is an extremely advanced crisis
[50:13.160 --> 50:18.440]  simulation software used by the U.K. government and even the United Nations, among others,
[50:18.440 --> 50:24.000]  to create and test different scenarios including pandemics, cyberattacks, earthquakes, and
[50:24.000 --> 50:30.280]  specifically monkeypox outbreaks. The software is finally tuned to resemble social media,
[50:30.280 --> 50:35.400]  including Facebook and Twitter. This particular wargame can be found on the U.K.'s professional
[50:35.400 --> 50:41.520]  wargaming site, Connections U.K. Interestingly, but possibly unrelated, the United States
[50:41.520 --> 50:46.800]  wargaming site includes training on how to target human trust on social media. It's like
[50:46.800 --> 50:52.040]  you don't really need that expensive virus if you can put together a couple of really
[50:52.040 --> 50:57.560]  really good Twitter handles and Facebook pages. What might our governments be preparing for?
[50:57.560 --> 51:05.920]  Is it already here? You say, OK, what if a bioterrorist brought smallpox to 10 airports?
[51:05.920 --> 51:12.520]  You know, how would the world respond to that? OK, Gabe, as if we don't have enough to worry
[51:12.520 --> 51:19.040]  about. Now we're hearing about the arrival of this other viral disease. It's called monkeypox.
[51:19.040 --> 51:24.720]  The number of confirmed or suspected cases of monkeypox worldwide is now 106. What the
[51:24.720 --> 51:34.360]  heck is monkeypox and do we actually need to worry about this? And in fact, the questions
[51:34.360 --> 51:39.680]  right now, Ankita, are what is this disease and why should we in India worry? A very
[51:39.680 --> 51:44.480]  rare virus to find outside West Africa. But what we've seen in the last couple of weeks
[51:44.480 --> 51:49.040]  is that more cases have occurred than has been the case historically for a long, long
[51:49.040 --> 51:58.280]  time. Videos on Bandot video from the front page, a very powerful contributor to Bandot
[51:58.280 --> 52:06.440]  video. Deep state. Monkeypox war games and vaccine side effects. And it in five minutes
[52:06.440 --> 52:10.560]  is a great job, but scratches the surface. That's all you can do in five minutes, but
[52:10.560 --> 52:17.880]  excellent job. So this is all like clockwork. They have to pre-prepare all this and get
[52:17.880 --> 52:22.600]  the bureaucracy ready. They hide it in plain view with war games because openly planning
[52:22.600 --> 52:27.680]  it is the death penalty. And then they launch it. They launch COVID-19. They launched the
[52:27.680 --> 52:35.560]  poison shots. They did it all. And that's where we are in the year 2022. And again, I'm
[52:35.560 --> 52:38.760]  going to say this to people that serve the system and make jokes about things. We're
[52:38.760 --> 52:43.960]  going to be covering this at the start of the next hour. You're lying to yourself. You
[52:43.960 --> 52:47.680]  can make jokes. You can get promoted on social media. You can get a pat on the head by the
[52:47.680 --> 52:56.000]  system. Maybe even some money to lie to people, but you're signing on to stuff that makes
[52:56.000 --> 53:03.400]  Hitler, Stalin, Mao Zedong, Genghis Khan and every other horrible mass murdering psychopath
[53:03.400 --> 53:10.440]  look like a amateur. You do not want to be part of this. You do not want to sign on to
[53:10.440 --> 53:21.600]  this, ladies and gentlemen. I'm going to tell you the rest of the story in the second
[53:21.600 --> 53:27.840]  hour. And I'm asking the millions of people tuned in now to realize the power you have.
[53:27.840 --> 53:32.160]  And if you don't exercise that power, you are aiding and abetting the people that are
[53:32.160 --> 53:37.920]  going to destroy our lives. And I don't say that as a guilt trip. I'm telling you that
[53:37.920 --> 53:43.720]  I look in the mirror every day and I know my faults and I know my laziness and I know
[53:43.720 --> 53:50.000]  my issues. Nobody wants to go hiking and fishing and love making more than me. Nobody wants
[53:50.000 --> 53:54.280]  to just sit back on a riverbank and drink a 12 pack of beer more than me. But you know
[53:54.280 --> 54:02.080]  what? I can't do it because my children and their children's future will be destroyed.
[54:02.080 --> 54:09.400]  Nobody wants to go to an Astros game or a Dallas Cowboys game as much as me. I grew
[54:09.400 --> 54:16.600]  up a sports head, but it's a diversion. My energy has to be put into this and we have
[54:16.600 --> 54:20.080]  to resist this because this is real. And you're not going to have to wait and see if Alex
[54:20.080 --> 54:32.240]  Shills is right anymore. You're now living this. You know, I grew up being told all about
[54:32.240 --> 54:36.880]  this. And when I was like eight years old, visiting my mother's father and my grandmother
[54:36.880 --> 54:42.480]  here in Austin, we were up in Dallas. My mother didn't talk bad about her father, but she'd
[54:42.480 --> 54:55.920]  say your grandfather's very eccentric. No, he wasn't eccentric. He was German in Dallas,
[54:55.920 --> 55:05.520]  in the richest area of Dallas with a bunch of rich Germans and they let him in on everything.
[55:05.520 --> 55:12.800]  And his son worked for the deep state, my uncle, and he got out of it and he told me
[55:12.800 --> 55:22.840]  all about it. But we don't need to sit here and debate whether this is going on or not.
[55:22.840 --> 55:35.680]  It's happening. It's punching you in the face. My grandfather produced secret weapons for
[55:35.680 --> 55:44.120]  DARPA. I don't know what he did specifically because it was all secret. And then at about
[55:44.120 --> 55:49.800]  57 years old, he freaked out, became a huge Christian. He was already Christian and broke
[55:49.800 --> 55:53.800]  with it. Shame. The government's bad. The government's evil. It wants to kill everybody.
[55:53.800 --> 56:02.800]  They work for Satan. And that's all he would say. And I'm going to leave it there. You
[56:02.800 --> 56:11.640]  know, he told me a little more and it would just be too unbelievable if I told you, but
[56:11.640 --> 56:17.160]  man, I hear this stuff when I was a kid and I just like, I had Dr. McCullough here Friday
[56:17.160 --> 56:21.240]  and he stopped me in the hall after we'd been on the show. He said, we're going to eat some
[56:21.240 --> 56:24.840]  barbecue in there in my office. He said, how do you know all this stuff? And I said, how
[56:24.840 --> 56:31.200]  do I know all this stuff? It's all over the news. You know, it's going on. But just people
[56:31.200 --> 56:42.440]  need to realize that this is not a damn game, ladies and gentlemen. And all the major elites
[56:42.440 --> 56:49.320]  of the planet have decided to transhumanize things and try to become gods and take alchemy.
[56:49.320 --> 57:00.520]  I've got a meme here that I put in my stack and I've lost. But man, does it say at all?
[57:00.520 --> 57:04.240]  Can't find it now. I go over these hundreds of articles and I put them in stacks. I can't
[57:04.240 --> 57:14.040]  find them. But just let me paraphrase it. What humans envisioned going back thousands of
[57:14.040 --> 57:20.520]  years ago, humans have now been able to do. And now the globalists have envisioned a nightmare
[57:20.520 --> 57:24.800]  they want us to live in. So we're going to come back next hour and look at all the other
[57:24.800 --> 57:30.720]  facets of the attack and what they're doing and are we going to sit back and let them
[57:30.720 --> 57:36.640]  do this to our children? That's the big question. Hour number two of the Alex Jones Sunday edition
[57:36.640 --> 57:42.560]  and then three and four. I would show it to myself was Sunday live info wars dot com forward
[57:42.560 --> 57:53.840]  slash show. This is life and death information info wars has made history. You have made
[57:53.840 --> 57:58.960]  history in your support of info wars. And one of the biggest tools we've had to circumvent
[57:58.960 --> 58:03.640]  and override the sensors has been patriot apparel so we can identify each other so we
[58:03.640 --> 58:08.280]  can spread the word and so we can push people to websites like info wars dot com so they
[58:08.280 --> 58:12.080]  can understand the globalist plan and how to stop it. Now, ladies and gentlemen, two
[58:12.080 --> 58:15.720]  months ago, we announced we're blowing out of all of our designs of t shirts, some of
[58:15.720 --> 58:19.560]  which go back more than 25 years. All these shirts are limited edition. They are about
[58:19.560 --> 58:24.840]  to be history and will only exist in your closet, your drawer or your wardrobe. So there's
[58:24.840 --> 58:29.440]  only 15,000 shirts of 60 plus thousand left. In a couple of weeks, they'll all be gone
[58:29.440 --> 58:35.680]  and they'll be history. We're selling them all at cost at infowarstore.com. So thank

[58:53.280 --> 58:57.880]  some of those original designs still for sale at infowarstore.com. These are real classics.
[58:57.880 --> 59:02.760]  But ladies and gentlemen, they're all about to be limited edition because we're selling
[59:02.760 --> 59:07.360]  out of them. They're about to be history and we're selling out of the hoodies, the ball
[59:07.360 --> 59:13.000]  caps, the t shirts, all these amazing designs at cost infowarstore.com except for this fundraiser
[59:13.000 --> 59:18.080]  shirt that is a real hit and people love it. It's 2495 Alex Jones is right on the front,

[59:23.320 --> 59:28.200]  first amendment, don't let the leftist and the globalist bully silence you and fund
[59:28.200 --> 59:33.040]  the info war at the same time. There is not a more politically incorrect shirt that sends
[59:33.040 --> 59:36.800]  a stronger message of freedom resistance to the new world order than the Alex Jones was
[59:36.800 --> 59:42.560]  right shirt exclusively available at infowarstore.com. And again, this shirt is limited edition
[59:42.560 --> 59:50.880]  as well. We're doing one more run and then no more infowarstore.com. Get yours today.
[59:50.880 --> 1:00:13.440]  Getting a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's Alex Jones from the
[1:00:13.440 --> 1:00:23.800]  front lines of the information war. It's Alex Jones. This is the drill lock ourselves down
[1:00:23.800 --> 1:00:27.880]  and piss all of ourselves with just a weaponized cold virus. They're going to release stuff
[1:00:27.880 --> 1:00:31.780]  that kills billions. And they just want you trained to stay in your house while you die.
[1:00:31.780 --> 1:00:35.880]  This is only the test bio weapon. The real ones are coming. And then the next one, they'll
[1:00:35.880 --> 1:00:39.040]  have another one once the once you've learned to lock down the drones, there'll be armed
[1:00:39.040 --> 1:00:43.400]  drones. The armed drones will stop people that have the plague in the future, you know,
[1:00:43.400 --> 1:00:46.400]  breaking quarantine and people will cheer it like it's the running man. And then they're
[1:00:46.400 --> 1:00:52.000]  going to hit you with the weaponized airborne Ebola splice with mousepox with the fire release
[1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:56.400]  and he really bow up and soon. I mean, we're in bad shape, folks. They've made their move.
[1:00:56.400 --> 1:01:00.720]  They dropped the hammer and all these lockdowns are beta tests for when they were released
[1:01:00.720 --> 1:01:05.760]  the real bio weapon in the future. Then all of you that had the vaccine binary weapon
[1:01:05.760 --> 1:01:10.880]  won't be able to resist. It's all binary weapons. If Bill Gates said last week, I played the
[1:01:10.880 --> 1:01:18.480]  clip last hour, he said talking to Stephen Colbert, the comic that poses a newsman that
[1:01:18.480 --> 1:01:25.280]  now poses as our doctor. He said, Oh, this is just wave one. The next wave is a bio attack.
[1:01:25.280 --> 1:01:29.720]  As I've told you for years, a real biotech. This is just making sure you behave yourself.
[1:01:29.720 --> 1:01:34.720]  Because they don't want things to get out of hand when they really take an axe to US.
[1:01:34.720 --> 1:01:37.600]  So the globalists are in a lot of trouble. The problem is they're going to launch even
[1:01:37.600 --> 1:01:43.760]  bigger attacks now. What's coming next after the COVID hoax? Depression and then more COVID hoax.
[1:01:43.760 --> 1:01:48.400]  Gates goes, Well, I'm not happy about this. See, they know it all backfired his gloating
[1:01:48.400 --> 1:01:55.520]  and his predicting what he himself did, what his group did. But he goes, Yeah, this is
[1:01:56.240 --> 1:02:01.280]  event one, event two is coming. It's a bio weapon attack. He's trying to tell Colbert,
[1:02:01.280 --> 1:02:08.320]  Hey, hey, stop it. I'm not invested in all this. And I'm not involved that I didn't predict it.
[1:02:08.320 --> 1:02:14.240]  I will tell you, the next one's going to be a lot worse. How many times have I told you how
[1:02:14.240 --> 1:02:18.880]  this works? It's common sense. They launch a simulate they own, they put vaccines in you
[1:02:18.880 --> 1:02:23.840]  that are binary weapons that lower your immunity. And then they start releasing the real stuff.
[1:02:23.840 --> 1:02:28.720]  Remember what I told you the last three months? And for years before that, but intensely every
[1:02:28.720 --> 1:02:34.560]  day for three months, four months, I've told you since late January that they release a small
[1:02:34.560 --> 1:02:40.800]  bio simulate that does kill people a few million globally. Then once they practice the lockdown,
[1:02:40.800 --> 1:02:44.480]  then they'll hit you with something that kills hundreds of millions next. They'll claim terrorists
[1:02:44.480 --> 1:02:51.120]  did it. And then big bio weapon attack comes after that. If we buy into it and submit, they'll do it
[1:02:51.120 --> 1:02:55.920]  the next year. If we resist five years, they can either release a new one under the COVID-19 name.
[1:02:55.920 --> 1:02:59.920]  This is a very complex virus, five different viruses, or they could already know what the
[1:02:59.920 --> 1:03:04.800]  mutation is going to be in the future, because all the pre-programming is the big massive death
[1:03:04.800 --> 1:03:08.880]  is going to come later. And he later went on Colbert after I said that and said,
[1:03:10.320 --> 1:03:18.000]  terrorists will release a bio weapon based on COVID-19 that will be much worse very soon.
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:23.120]  It began giggling and laughing like only a super villain would do. The best thing you can do is
[1:03:23.120 --> 1:03:27.200]  get to the countryside somewhere and try to dig in, because it's all just going to get worse.
[1:03:27.200 --> 1:03:31.600]  And as soon as they get everybody to accept these lockdowns and forced inoculations that lower the
[1:03:31.600 --> 1:03:36.800]  immunity, they're going to release mass bio weapons and kill billions of people. This is only phase
[1:03:36.800 --> 1:03:42.400]  one. Once you've gone to the lockdown for about two or three years, then the real bio weapons
[1:03:42.400 --> 1:03:47.440]  get released. Now, I've told you this for decades. Gates said it a few months ago. He said, this is
[1:03:47.440 --> 1:03:54.400]  just a drill. The real things coming from terrorists. And he and Colbert began to have a visual satanic
[1:03:54.400 --> 1:04:00.000]  type of gleeful orgasm. And then once we pass this test of submission, they're going to release
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:04.480]  even more deadly bio weapons. One of their plans is if we all lock down properly, if we all stay
[1:04:04.480 --> 1:04:09.040]  in our houses properly, and let them bankrupt us and let them train us to be slaves and let them
[1:04:09.040 --> 1:04:14.640]  censor all of us, they'll go ahead and accelerate to their final goal, which is just to release a
[1:04:14.640 --> 1:04:20.080]  super bio weapon and kill seven billion people. This is the end of the Republic, the end of the
[1:04:20.080 --> 1:04:25.600]  country, the end of the world, as you know it. This is the global extermination plan. And now
[1:04:25.600 --> 1:04:31.040]  they're so far into it, I'm able to track the type it is. I knew they had different models to
[1:04:31.040 --> 1:04:36.160]  first launch test attacks and then prepare and then a few years later launch bigger attacks
[1:04:36.160 --> 1:04:41.600]  each time killing more of us. But they've decided to go ahead and just accelerate all the way now.
[1:04:41.600 --> 1:04:46.320]  And I would say by a year from now, they'll release a bio weapon that probably kills four
[1:04:46.320 --> 1:04:52.240]  million people. So they covered up the previous attacks with new attacks that get bigger. And
[1:04:52.240 --> 1:04:56.000]  now the only way they're going to get away with these bio weapons they've launched is getting
[1:04:56.000 --> 1:05:00.880]  everybody into the fact that they signed on. We here at Info Wars are proud to announce the first
[1:05:00.880 --> 1:05:07.280]  ever Kava Kava root supplements that is now available at InfoWarsStore.com. Kava is one of
[1:05:07.280 --> 1:05:12.000]  the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today, though it has been used for
[1:05:12.000 --> 1:05:16.960]  hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation and euphoric effects.
[1:05:16.960 --> 1:05:22.640]  According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa,
[1:05:22.640 --> 1:05:27.920]  who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe. The Samoan people
[1:05:27.920 --> 1:05:32.960]  would drink Kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little.
[1:05:32.960 --> 1:05:38.800]  Nowadays, Kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits. The new Kava Chill
[1:05:38.800 --> 1:05:44.880]  by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only Kava Kava, but other herbs including,
[1:05:44.880 --> 1:05:51.680]  but not limited to, German Kama Mill, Organic Skull Cap, and Balerian root. We do expect to sell
[1:05:51.680 --> 1:06:04.800]  this new product quickly, so be sure to secure yours by visiting InfoWarsStore.com.
[1:06:52.240 --> 1:06:59.280]  All right, we're gonna hit the big issues right now. The confirmed chemical attacks going on to
[1:06:59.280 --> 1:07:05.520]  the food and water supply and electromagnetically in their own admissions, and then they're
[1:07:05.520 --> 1:07:12.000]  countered to us telling people we can stop it. Now, I don't just have all the documents,
[1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:16.720]  I don't just have all the admissions I'm about to show you. Here on the Alex Jones
[1:07:16.720 --> 1:07:24.640]  Show as we start our number two on this Sunday night, May 22nd, 2022.
[1:07:26.960 --> 1:07:36.160]  I have sources inside big chemical, and I looked it up. One of these individuals' father
[1:07:36.160 --> 1:07:46.880]  had the patent on a whole class of bisphenols in plastics, but he said we can do another chemical
[1:07:46.880 --> 1:07:54.800]  process even cheaper, and you shouldn't put out these plastics I invented because it causes the
[1:07:54.800 --> 1:08:00.800]  sterilization of men and the hyperfeminization of women, which makes them accelerate their aging.
[1:08:00.800 --> 1:08:10.320]  So like a 30-year-old woman's 60 genetically in their ovaries. Every time I touch on this in the
[1:08:10.320 --> 1:08:17.200]  last 25 years or so, I've been on here 28 years, but I wasn't on it until about 25 years ago,
[1:08:17.200 --> 1:08:24.960]  I wasn't really over the target. They've had Stephen Colbert, they've had Jimmy Kimmel,
[1:08:24.960 --> 1:08:32.320]  they've had all of them, and then the news shows and news articles say Jones is insane.
[1:08:33.120 --> 1:08:39.840]  He says chemicals in the water lower sperm count, 90-plus percent. He says that it mutates boys
[1:08:39.840 --> 1:08:45.840]  and be quasi-feminine. They're not hemaphroditic, but they're like a girl in many of their cells
[1:08:45.840 --> 1:08:55.600]  and brain development in genitals, and genitals shrink a sign of that, the hemaphroditic movement.
[1:08:55.600 --> 1:09:01.600]  They attack because this was their previous operation, but now they're just going straight
[1:09:01.600 --> 1:09:07.360]  to poison shots. They call vaccines that implant the DNA, not just of you, but your children,
[1:09:07.360 --> 1:09:17.040]  with a cancer-causing, blood clot-causing kill switch, and that's mainline news now. So I'm
[1:09:17.040 --> 1:09:21.680]  not going to name drop here, but I always like to give you where things came from. I'd forgotten
[1:09:21.680 --> 1:09:33.280]  about this, so I sent a prominent talk show host a clip today, and I said, you know, here's these
[1:09:33.280 --> 1:09:38.880]  late-night shows, and here's these, you know, big Twitter accounts with millions of views,
[1:09:39.920 --> 1:09:47.120]  saying I'm lying about chemicals causing penises to shrink, because the media seized on that to edit
[1:09:47.120 --> 1:09:53.280]  that out and just not show the proof I showed last week, I'm about to show you again, and just
[1:09:53.280 --> 1:10:00.400]  think of the evil of that. They know, they just saw the proof, London Telegraph, New York Times
[1:10:00.400 --> 1:10:04.800]  admitting it, but not telling you why it's happening, and then they just say, oh, it's not happening.
[1:10:05.680 --> 1:10:11.520]  There's Sky News. Human penises are shrinking because of pollution-worn scientists. It's
[1:10:11.520 --> 1:10:21.600]  a little bit more than that, and it's specific. So this Ron Fliposkey, who makes his job to attack
[1:10:21.600 --> 1:10:26.320]  us, which is fine, because the truth will come out, Alex Jones says, globalists are putting
[1:10:26.320 --> 1:10:30.960]  chemicals in the liners of soft drink cans, that's like mainline news, that it's causing men's
[1:10:30.960 --> 1:10:39.280]  penises to shrink. That was one footnote of the mutations it's causing, and you can see the video
[1:10:39.280 --> 1:10:52.000]  right there, that one with a million views. So all we're doing is showing articles, they don't show
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:56.880]  you that, they just go, oh, he's a discredited person we've attacked, don't show the articles,
[1:10:56.880 --> 1:11:01.520]  just show him talking about it and saying it's not happening. Man, that's like damn evil,
[1:11:01.520 --> 1:11:07.440]  isn't it? As if this guy and Twitter and people doing this think they won't be attacked by it,
[1:11:07.440 --> 1:11:11.120]  or they don't think they're being affected by it. They pretend to themselves.
[1:11:12.720 --> 1:11:17.440]  So I'm going to show you this clip, and then I'm going to show you article after article after
[1:11:17.440 --> 1:11:22.320]  article, and then I'm going to show you the New York Times, and then I'm going to show you best-selling
[1:11:22.320 --> 1:11:29.200]  scientist authors saying the same thing, but not going all the way. So here's the viral clip.
[1:11:31.040 --> 1:11:35.440]  Does this to humans as well? That's why genitals, I don't care if you're black or white,
[1:11:36.160 --> 1:11:43.440]  are a third the size they were of a 1960s male. So the media makes jokes about that a few months
[1:11:43.440 --> 1:11:47.840]  ago, and I gave the example of, you know, if your daddy's Johnson was a foot long, yours is six
[1:11:47.840 --> 1:11:52.560]  inches long, and if yours was six inches, your son will be three inches, and the one that won't
[1:11:52.560 --> 1:11:59.600]  even have a penis. We can make jokes about that all day long, but it's hitting the game.
[1:12:01.600 --> 1:12:08.560]  You can say, okay, well, who cares? Well, we're sterilized, and the sperm counts are down 96%,
[1:12:08.560 --> 1:12:14.640]  but they didn't show in the articles I showed. They made a joke, oh, Jones admits he has a small
[1:12:14.640 --> 1:12:20.560]  ding-dong. Well, I'd rather have it cut off of its safe humanity, but that it becomes this big joke
[1:12:21.440 --> 1:12:27.200]  when this is real, and this is sterilizing the animals that drink out of the Creeks and Rivers
[1:12:27.200 --> 1:12:34.240]  just the runoff of what we're drinking and what we are eating. So I'm going to go to break here
[1:12:34.240 --> 1:12:39.360]  in about four minutes and come back with video documents, but let's just show a few articles
[1:12:39.360 --> 1:12:44.080]  to all the folks making jokes over at Twitter. In fact, in case they can't read, I'll go ahead
[1:12:44.080 --> 1:12:52.560]  and highlight it. This is the New York Times. Your God, the everyday chemicals that might be
[1:12:52.560 --> 1:12:57.680]  leading us to our extinction. We'll play a clip of the author of this, it was on Joe Rogan and
[1:12:57.680 --> 1:13:04.000]  Governal, and we have all the documents. Here's the book I'm talking about. We'll play the next segment.
[1:13:05.040 --> 1:13:13.200]  Countdown. How our modern world is threatening sperm counts gathered down 96%,
[1:13:13.200 --> 1:13:17.920]  altering male and female reproductive development, and imperiling the future of the human race.
[1:13:20.720 --> 1:13:26.560]  And it shows the New York Times talking about it. Oh, then he makes another joke. Oh, Jones
[1:13:26.560 --> 1:13:32.080]  claims girls are going to puberty earlier. That's not true. He's insane, even though it's massive
[1:13:32.080 --> 1:13:41.360]  problem on record. Here's Sky TV out of the UK. Human penises are shrinking because of pollution,
[1:13:41.360 --> 1:13:47.600]  warned scientists. Dr. Shana Sean has found that chemicals, she wrote the book called phallates,
[1:13:47.600 --> 1:13:52.160]  are causing human babies to be born with malformed genitals. But what's who cares if babies are
[1:13:52.160 --> 1:13:57.760]  deformed? Scientists say human penises are shrinking due to pollution, which they do by
[1:13:57.760 --> 1:14:04.400]  design. It's a formula. It's even cheaper not to do it. They pay more to do it. That's Jerusalem post.
[1:14:04.960 --> 1:14:13.280]  Oh, but you're not going to have Ron Flipkowski talk about that. He'll just edit it out and say,
[1:14:13.280 --> 1:14:22.640]  look, Jones is insane. He made it up. Here's another one. India today. Human penises are
[1:14:22.640 --> 1:14:31.280]  shrinking due to pollution. Euro news. Penises are shrinking because of pollution.
[1:14:33.680 --> 1:14:42.720]  And it goes on and on with article after article after article. We'll play a clip of an excerpt
[1:14:42.720 --> 1:14:47.360]  of the best selling scientific book written by a doctor with all the footnotes in a minute,
[1:14:47.360 --> 1:14:52.080]  but just remember, I did this earlier in the week with all the proof.
[1:14:54.320 --> 1:14:58.240]  And on the late night comedy and on the news shows and on the Twitter feeds,
[1:14:58.240 --> 1:15:03.840]  they put out any version saying he made it up because they don't want you to know. So remember,
[1:15:03.840 --> 1:15:07.680]  it also causes cancer. Maybe you don't want to have a penis. Maybe you want your daughter to
[1:15:07.680 --> 1:15:12.080]  go into puberty at five and die when she started a cancer. That's trendy. I get it. It's awesome.
[1:15:12.720 --> 1:15:17.120]  You know, like Apple runs death camps in China, but he's gay, so it's cool.
[1:15:17.840 --> 1:15:22.640]  But the point is, is that this is going on and this is happening. And that's why they want
[1:15:22.640 --> 1:15:27.440]  to censor us and shut us down so they can just murder you with all this and not give you a
[1:15:27.440 --> 1:15:32.800]  chance to respond to it. And you'll see clips on the news making fun of it out of context.
[1:15:32.800 --> 1:15:38.080]  They won't show all those articles because again, they're murdering you. They're your enemies. They
[1:15:38.080 --> 1:15:44.240]  love it. They enjoy it and they're not going to stop because they're evil people turned over
[1:15:44.240 --> 1:15:50.640]  to absolute corruption. Small penises at least your problem. How about sterilization and early
[1:15:50.640 --> 1:16:02.640]  cancer? How about death? Well, they're right back. Stay with us. Granny do right. Granny do right.
[1:16:02.640 --> 1:16:06.960]  Thanks for holding her on the air. Go ahead. Challenge. First of all, let me say I love your
[1:16:06.960 --> 1:16:12.800]  products. I am a granny and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime
[1:16:12.800 --> 1:16:18.880]  in the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called. But since
[1:16:18.880 --> 1:16:24.400]  taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous actually. People
[1:16:24.400 --> 1:16:30.800]  think I'm 55 years old. And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know,
[1:16:30.800 --> 1:16:35.360]  well, maybe that's what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation. But
[1:16:35.360 --> 1:16:40.560]  when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately. But you know, over a period of time,
[1:16:40.560 --> 1:16:45.840]  I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket. This is working. This is wonderful. You
[1:16:45.840 --> 1:16:52.560]  know, I don't, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore. You know, so anyway, it works wonderfully
[1:16:52.560 --> 1:16:54.960]  and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[1:16:58.160 --> 1:17:03.600]  Info Wars has made history. You have made history in your support of Info Wars. And one of the
[1:17:03.600 --> 1:17:09.440]  biggest tools we've had to circumvent and override the sensors has been Patriot Apparel,
[1:17:09.440 --> 1:17:13.760]  so we can identify each other so we can spread the word and so we can push people to websites
[1:17:13.760 --> 1:17:18.320]  like infowars.com so they can understand the globalist plan and how to stop it.
[1:17:18.320 --> 1:17:21.920]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, two months ago, we announced we're blowing out of all of our designs

[1:19:56.400 --> 1:20:03.920]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:26.400 --> 1:20:49.280]  All right, so I just showed you a stack of Jerusalem Posts, Sky News, New York Times,
[1:20:49.280 --> 1:20:56.000]  Shakespeare counts down 90%, massive cancers, girls going into puberty at age five, age three,
[1:20:56.000 --> 1:21:03.280]  on average age nine, used to be age 13, absolute acceleration of aging. You look at all the studies,
[1:21:03.280 --> 1:21:09.440]  the frogs, literally wanting to have sex with their male frogs so the species become extinct in
[1:21:09.440 --> 1:21:14.400]  Texas and in South Africa, all of that. And we're like, what's going on? It's dangerous.
[1:21:14.400 --> 1:21:22.720]  It's a countdown to human extinction. And their answer is, shut up. You're a racist.
[1:21:25.520 --> 1:21:31.680]  Think about that. Let that sink in. So here's an excerpt. It's on amazon.com. From a countdown,
[1:21:31.680 --> 1:21:35.920]  How Our Modern World Is Threatening, Sperm Counts, Accelerating Male and Female Reproductive
[1:21:36.640 --> 1:21:42.240]  Development and Impairing the Future of the Human Race, Human Extinction by Dr. Shauna A.
[1:21:42.240 --> 1:21:49.680]  Sean. Here is a clip. She had a whole Joe Rogan interview last year because I was like pointing
[1:21:49.680 --> 1:21:56.640]  this out to Joe today and he's like, well, do you know about that? I forgot about that. That's
[1:21:56.640 --> 1:22:04.560]  what I'm saying. It's so prolific that it's insane. I'm trying to get him to cover this stuff.
[1:22:05.120 --> 1:22:09.680]  And then he's like, well, I already covered it. Okay, look at him say this didn't happen. Here's
[1:22:09.680 --> 1:22:13.520]  a bunch of articles. Yeah, Alan said, oh, I forgot. I actually listened to the interviewer,
[1:22:13.520 --> 1:22:18.000]  most of it's like three hours long. But that's what's so crazy is it's on record. It's happening.
[1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:22.320]  And you've got late night comics making jokes. You've got all the Twitter armies
[1:22:22.320 --> 1:22:26.000]  were censored. So they could just put it a little clip to make it sound insane.
[1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:29.440]  You should take that personal. And I should ask the people that are part of this,
[1:22:29.440 --> 1:22:35.120]  like, what's your problem? Like you really think you're part of the establishment? You're delusional.
[1:22:35.120 --> 1:22:42.480]  And we'll give you the rest of the story after that with Bill Maher coming out saying trans is
[1:22:42.480 --> 1:22:49.360]  because it's trendy. It's beyond trendy and Disney announced today I've got the press release.
[1:22:50.320 --> 1:22:54.240]  They said we are going to try to get your children to not be heterosexual. So they don't
[1:22:54.240 --> 1:22:59.280]  have children. We are tired of your children through toys and all the foods at the grocery store
[1:22:59.280 --> 1:23:03.680]  with all the stuff on it. It's not about somebody wanting to have sex with the same sex. It's about
[1:23:03.680 --> 1:23:09.840]  the government pushing it and demanding it as they mutate it so we don't have children. It's about
[1:23:09.840 --> 1:23:34.880]  the population. Here's a few minutes from the book with a great voiceover.
[1:23:39.840 --> 1:23:43.920]  Pieces of the puzzle are being put together as you'll see in the chapters that follow.
[1:23:45.120 --> 1:23:49.600]  You'll learn more about the breadth of these scary declines and sperm counts and other
[1:23:49.600 --> 1:23:54.720]  aspects of reproductive function as well as the factors that are likely to blame for these
[1:23:54.720 --> 1:24:00.160]  unfortunate effects in human beings and other species based on scientific research.
[1:24:01.520 --> 1:24:07.280]  The following is clear. The current state of reproductive affairs can't continue much longer
[1:24:07.280 --> 1:24:13.840]  without threatening human survival. Current levels of sperm counts and concentrations
[1:24:13.840 --> 1:24:19.920]  and decreased fertility are already posing serious threats to western populations on
[1:24:19.920 --> 1:24:26.480]  both ends of the human lifespan. Infertility is linked to an increased risk of certain diseases
[1:24:26.480 --> 1:24:32.000]  and earlier death in both men and women while leading to a decrease in the number of children
[1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:39.440]  born over time. Obviously this isn't a healthy scenario for Homo sapiens or for other threatened
[1:24:39.440 --> 1:24:46.960]  or endangered species. Already some countries with problematic age distributions are grappling
[1:24:46.960 --> 1:24:52.480]  with shrinking populations with increasing numbers of older people being supported by
[1:24:52.480 --> 1:25:00.240]  fewer younger people. It's a fairly bleak picture I admit but it's an important one to be aware of
[1:25:00.240 --> 1:25:06.560]  because unless we take steps to reverse these harmful influences the planet's species are
[1:25:06.560 --> 1:25:13.360]  in grave danger. Right now the important measures that might improve the situation aren't happening.
[1:25:14.480 --> 1:25:21.200]  The 2017 publication of my meta-analysis on sperm count decline in western countries
[1:25:21.200 --> 1:25:26.560]  put this issue on the radar screen grabbing headlines and television coverage around the world
[1:25:26.560 --> 1:25:32.880]  but the findings haven't translated into committees being formed, environmental policies being
[1:25:32.880 --> 1:25:39.120]  changed, safer chemicals being manufactured or other concerted efforts being made to address
[1:25:39.120 --> 1:25:46.240]  the suspected causes or protect our collective future. Some people are in denial about the
[1:25:46.240 --> 1:25:52.240]  reality and gravity of the issue and others shrug it off saying the earth is overpopulated.
[1:25:52.240 --> 1:25:57.600]  Others acknowledge the sperm count decline and the likelihood of a stagnation or decline in global
[1:25:57.600 --> 1:26:03.440]  population in the near future but even they don't engage in much more than hand-wringing.
[1:26:03.440 --> 1:26:10.160]  In some ways the sperm count decline is akin to where global warming was 40 years ago reported
[1:26:10.160 --> 1:26:17.600]  upon but denied or ignored. Sometime between the 2006 release of Al Gore's Oscar-winning
[1:26:17.600 --> 1:26:24.320]  documentary An Inconvenient Truth and Now the climate crisis has been accepted at least by
[1:26:24.320 --> 1:26:30.000]  most people as a real threat. My hope is that the same will happen with the reproductive
[1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:37.440]  turmoil that's upon us. Increasingly scientists are in agreement on the threat. Now we need the
[1:26:37.440 --> 1:26:43.840]  public to take this issue seriously. As a leading researcher on reproductive health and the
[1:26:43.840 --> 1:26:49.440]  environment, I feel it's my duty to draw attention to these alarming changes to sexual
[1:26:49.440 --> 1:26:55.600]  development and function. My interest in the effects of environmental factors on reproductive
[1:26:55.600 --> 1:27:02.880]  health started in the 1980s when I investigated a cluster of miscarriages in Santa Clara County,
[1:27:02.880 --> 1:27:09.200]  California, a trend that was eventually tied to toxic waste from a semiconductor plant that had
[1:27:09.200 --> 1:27:15.200]  leaked into the community's drinking water. Gradually, I became increasingly interested
[1:27:15.200 --> 1:27:21.440]  in investigating the potential effects that environmental chemicals can have on reproductive,
[1:27:21.440 --> 1:27:28.960]  sexual, and gender-related development in men, women, and children. Over the last 30 years,
[1:27:28.960 --> 1:27:34.480]  I've conducted studies on everything from the origins of genital anomalies and newborns
[1:27:34.480 --> 1:27:40.480]  and the influence of prenatal stress on reproductive development in offspring,
[1:27:40.480 --> 1:27:46.400]  to the effects of many hours of TV watching on testicular function, the connection between
[1:27:46.400 --> 1:27:52.800]  high exposure to chemicals called phthalates and low interest in sexual activity, and many other
[1:27:52.800 --> 1:27:59.920]  subjects related to reproductive health. Reversing the various reproduction sabotaging effects that
[1:27:59.920 --> 1:28:06.720]  we're living with will require fundamental changes, including sweeping modifications to the kinds and
[1:28:06.720 --> 1:28:13.360]  volumes of chemicals that are manufactured and pumped into the environment. To make this happen,
[1:28:13.360 --> 1:28:19.840]  significant political and economic... So there are good people in the system, good scientists,
[1:28:19.840 --> 1:28:25.840]  good doctors like this woman. We have to listen to them. We have to understand and not make jokes
[1:28:25.840 --> 1:28:31.120]  on late night comedy or on Twitter and edit out what we've said. So watch. They'll edit this
[1:28:31.120 --> 1:28:35.920]  because they love it and make it look foolish because they love death. And they're literally
[1:28:36.800 --> 1:28:40.480]  killing us. It's another form of murder. It's worse. You don't just kill the person. You kill
[1:28:40.480 --> 1:28:43.840]  their children. You kill their genetics. You kill their whole future. It's called
[1:28:44.800 --> 1:28:49.280]  genocide of the human species. It's called countdown to extinction.
[1:28:49.280 --> 1:28:56.320]  They're right back with more big, breaking news. Stay with us in FullWars.com.
[1:29:00.800 --> 1:29:04.560]  Granny Do Right. Granny Do Right. Thanks for holding her on the air. Go ahead.
[1:29:04.560 --> 1:29:10.560]  Challenge. First of all, let me say I love your products. I am a granny and for all the senior
[1:29:10.560 --> 1:29:15.840]  citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots
[1:29:15.840 --> 1:29:21.520]  or age spots as they're lovingly called. But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years,
[1:29:21.520 --> 1:29:26.240]  my skin is just really gorgeous, actually. People think I'm 55 years old.
[1:29:27.360 --> 1:29:32.080]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what
[1:29:32.080 --> 1:29:36.800]  I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation. But when I started taking it,
[1:29:36.800 --> 1:29:42.080]  I mean, it doesn't happen immediately. But, you know, over a period of time, I started noticing,
[1:29:42.080 --> 1:29:46.560]  okay, you know, this is a ticket. This is working. This is wonderful. You know, I don't,
[1:29:47.360 --> 1:29:52.960]  I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know. So anyway, it worked wonderfully. And it
[1:29:52.960 --> 1:30:00.880]  really has totally cleared up my skin. I designed over 200 t-shirts the last 25 years. And we have
[1:30:00.880 --> 1:30:05.760]  some of those original designs still for sale at FullWars.com. These are real classics.
[1:30:05.760 --> 1:30:10.400]  But ladies and gentlemen, they're all about to be limited edition because we're selling

[1:33:03.360 --> 1:33:33.280]  Alex Jones. Albert Borla of Pfizer is up on TV saying, oh, we're going to make you
[1:33:33.280 --> 1:33:38.560]  take drugs, vaccines, you name it through chips, Bill Gates is saying it too. And they're all
[1:33:38.560 --> 1:33:42.880]  over the news saying the chemicals and the food and water are sterilizing us. But when you talk
[1:33:42.880 --> 1:33:48.640]  about it and say you don't want it, the entire establishment attacks you. But the people being
[1:33:48.640 --> 1:33:55.840]  part of this, going along with this, they're destroying themselves. They've sold out, ladies
[1:33:55.840 --> 1:34:01.200]  and gentlemen, here is the head of Pfizer talking about the next level of biomedical tyranny.
[1:34:01.200 --> 1:34:09.600]  It is basically a biological seep that it is in the tablet. And once you take the tablet
[1:34:10.160 --> 1:34:13.520]  and dissolve it into your stomach, it sends a signal that you took the tablet.
[1:34:14.320 --> 1:34:19.680]  So imagine the applications of that compliance, the insurance companies to know that the
[1:34:19.680 --> 1:34:27.680]  medicines that patients should take, they do take them. It is fascinating what happens in this field.
[1:34:27.680 --> 1:34:32.880]  Oh, it's fascinating. Here is the World Health Organization's regional director for Europe.
[1:34:34.160 --> 1:34:39.280]  He's saying he's concerned of the spread of monkeypox in 88 countries that Bill Gates predicted
[1:34:39.280 --> 1:34:44.400]  would happen two years ago and has now happened, right when the UN treaties being ran through to
[1:34:44.400 --> 1:34:50.640]  take over all nation state sovereignty, that people might be congregating. I've got a whole stack
[1:34:50.640 --> 1:34:58.240]  of news. The New York mayor, the LA mayor, the California governor, just dozens of articles
[1:34:58.240 --> 1:35:01.840]  right here in my stacks. You can look at it, it's all over the news. You don't want me to tell you
[1:35:01.840 --> 1:35:10.400]  about it. Saying that we can't have people congregate the monkeypox. We all got to wear
[1:35:10.400 --> 1:35:22.320]  masks. New York just said mask again, monkeypox. But then meanwhile, the borders wide open,
[1:35:22.320 --> 1:35:26.960]  they're trying to erase Title 42 for any medical testing of the few they catch.
[1:35:26.960 --> 1:35:38.720]  And you have the head of the WHO in Europe saying they're really worried about people
[1:35:40.160 --> 1:35:49.040]  congregating. It's you, you were bad, not the open borders, not record collapse of
[1:35:49.040 --> 1:35:54.720]  Africa and Latin America with all those diseases into the Western world. No, no, no, no, no, no,
[1:35:54.720 --> 1:35:59.760]  no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't listen to Senator Marco Rubio when he even said, well,
[1:35:59.760 --> 1:36:04.560]  citizens coming in that might have a disease can't come in, but non-citizens can. Just forget that
[1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:14.000]  and realize that your suspension of logic is key to being a good slave. So here is the WHO official.
[1:36:17.120 --> 1:36:21.920]  This has spread to many countries all at the same time, and that is the source of the concern,
[1:36:21.920 --> 1:36:27.120]  because it just doesn't behave as previous outbreaks, which have been sporadic and related to
[1:36:27.120 --> 1:36:32.560]  travel. But apart from that first case in the UK, there is no connection, obvious connection,
[1:36:32.560 --> 1:36:39.600]  between these cases. And that is, that is a concern. And why the WHO is raising this possibility,
[1:36:39.600 --> 1:36:45.760]  given that it's spread through direct skin to skin contact, that if you get large groups of
[1:36:45.760 --> 1:36:53.040]  particularly young people together in over the summer at festivals and the like, that this might
[1:36:53.040 --> 1:36:59.840]  accelerate that spread further, they call it an amplifying population. Now, that would be a concern
[1:36:59.840 --> 1:37:09.760]  and why the WHO has raised it now. This is generally a mild disease for most. And we need to balance
[1:37:09.760 --> 1:37:14.160]  this with, you know, particularly coming out of the pandemic, that we don't cause undue concern.
[1:37:14.160 --> 1:37:19.600]  But this is, once again, an animal virus that's spread to the human population. And we know that
[1:37:19.600 --> 1:37:23.840]  that's not a good thing. And that's why public health teams do want to get on top of this,
[1:37:23.840 --> 1:37:28.960]  either through public awareness and getting people to think about these symptoms, or through the use
[1:37:28.960 --> 1:37:35.360]  of this smallpox vaccine, which is really lying, allaying, gathering dust on the shelves, because
[1:37:35.360 --> 1:37:41.760]  smallpox just doesn't circulate around anymore. But through happy coincidence, it is 85% effective
[1:37:41.760 --> 1:37:49.280]  against monkeypox as well. By happy coincidence, they make it, it's ready. It's not gathering dust,
[1:37:49.280 --> 1:37:54.160]  that they ordered the making of it a year ago. And Bill Gates said it was coming and he is a
[1:37:54.160 --> 1:38:01.920]  prophet. Meanwhile, millions a month come across the California, Arizona, Texas border.
[1:38:03.040 --> 1:38:07.680]  No one's checked. Biden wants to arrest Title 42 for the few that might be checked.
[1:38:07.680 --> 1:38:14.720]  But you need to know it's your fault. And you don't want to go to a nightclub. You don't want to
[1:38:14.720 --> 1:38:21.680]  go to work. You don't want to have a job. You need a vaccine pass to live. We need a UN treaty to
[1:38:21.680 --> 1:38:29.840]  protect us. And I've got clip after clip after clip from New York and from California, saying you
[1:38:29.840 --> 1:38:36.080]  can't go outside. You've got to wear a mask, monkeypox. While they're claiming it comes from
[1:38:36.080 --> 1:38:44.560]  the third world, it comes from the rainforest, it comes from the Congo. None of that's true, folks.
[1:38:44.560 --> 1:38:48.400]  We've got the articles right here. They've sequenced it. It comes out of a lab. And yeah,
[1:38:48.400 --> 1:38:54.800]  it's a little bit stronger than normal monkeypox. We're so powerful as a species, they have trouble
[1:38:54.800 --> 1:38:59.520]  dominating us. And no matter what they hit us with, like we're cockroaches or something,
[1:38:59.520 --> 1:39:06.400]  we just fight back and overcome it. So they're like, how do we kill people and pose as the saviors?
[1:39:06.400 --> 1:39:14.080]  How do we hit them with chemicals and biologicals and 5G radiologicals? How do we get them to just
[1:39:14.080 --> 1:39:20.560]  go away and die? Because if we don't, we've done something 10,000 times, a million times,
[1:39:20.560 --> 1:39:25.520]  bigger than Bernie Madoff. The numbers are incredible. Thousands of quadrillions of fake
[1:39:25.520 --> 1:39:31.360]  currency. What are we going to do as they wake up to us? What are we going to do as they learn
[1:39:31.360 --> 1:39:37.200]  what we've done? Well, just use another panic, another virus. And then they don't even hide the
[1:39:37.200 --> 1:39:42.880]  fact they've been wargaming and preparing and the whole scenarios for what's happening right now.
[1:39:44.880 --> 1:39:49.040]  Are you going to be locked down again? Are you going to take the monkeypox shot? Are you going
[1:39:49.040 --> 1:39:56.640]  to bow? How many times will you bow to Bill Gates? How many times will you get on your knees
[1:39:56.640 --> 1:40:04.960]  for Clown Schwamp? How many times will you bend over to the Carnegie and the CIA? How many times
[1:40:04.960 --> 1:40:10.160]  is the Eastern establishment and the so-called elites that think they're better than all us
[1:40:10.160 --> 1:40:14.880]  and hate us so much they want to kill us so they can inherit the earth they stole?
[1:40:14.880 --> 1:40:24.320]  How many times do you have to grovel to Bill Gates and Tedros and these mass murders when what
[1:40:24.320 --> 1:40:28.400]  they're doing is transparent to any conscious person? I'll say this.
[1:40:31.200 --> 1:40:37.680]  And this is very profound. If you let them do this to you and your family, when you have all
[1:40:37.680 --> 1:40:48.320]  the evidence and all the facts, their argument is you deserve it. You deserve to die, according to
[1:40:48.320 --> 1:40:59.280]  Prince Charles. You deserve to be murdered because even while they're killing you, even while they're
[1:40:59.280 --> 1:41:05.360]  cutting off your resources and announcing that you're non-essential, even while they are involved
[1:41:05.360 --> 1:41:13.040]  in their slaughterhouse, you can't admit you're under attack. And if you have that attitude
[1:41:13.040 --> 1:41:19.440]  and if you have that worldview, it's not my view, it's their view. You deserve to die.
[1:41:21.040 --> 1:41:30.880]  D-I-E, die. And they're saying we want you to die. We don't need you. We have robots. We have
[1:41:30.880 --> 1:41:37.360]  everything. Humans aren't just cheap slaves now. They're crap. They're garbage. They're obsolete.
[1:41:37.360 --> 1:41:49.600]  They're non-essential. They're over. They are phased out. They are a cancer. All the news
[1:41:49.600 --> 1:41:54.560]  and your children going to public schools with these rich globalists telling you you're crap,
[1:41:55.200 --> 1:41:59.760]  telling you you're filth, telling you you're worthless, and then you look at these worthless
[1:41:59.760 --> 1:42:08.640]  people telling you that, and do you submit to Bill Gates and Tedros and William and Peter
[1:42:08.640 --> 1:42:17.520]  Dazik and all the rest of them in Fauci, or do you say to Tedros and the rest of them that I'm
[1:42:17.520 --> 1:42:23.040]  not a slave, and I have value, and my children have value, and my ancestors that fought and
[1:42:23.040 --> 1:42:28.000]  clawed for the success of our species and the launch pad that has planted earth, we're not
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:34.320]  going to let you steal our birthright. We're going to stand against you and we're going to defeat you.

[1:47:00.640 --> 1:47:23.040]  New World Order. It's Alex Jones. All right, I'm here every Sunday, four to six p.m. central.
[1:47:23.600 --> 1:47:28.000]  We have Sunday live with Owen Schreuer, another guest host. I'm six to eight p.m. but I'm gonna
[1:47:28.000 --> 1:47:34.800]  host a little bit of the next hour to air something particularly informative. Badass Uncle Sam is in
[1:47:34.800 --> 1:47:40.400]  Louisiana. He's been censored off all media, but he's very popular at Bandai video. He's been
[1:47:40.400 --> 1:47:44.800]  censored off all corporate media, establishment, globalist media, I should say, but he's still alive
[1:47:44.800 --> 1:47:49.520]  and well and reaching hundreds of thousands of people a week, conservatively, thanks to all of
[1:47:49.520 --> 1:47:56.000]  you. And he really had an important message this week that he pulled out. And I want to echo that
[1:47:56.000 --> 1:48:00.480]  to all of you right now. In fact, I had a meme here that's going viral, but I can't find it in
[1:48:00.480 --> 1:48:07.840]  the stack. Maybe tomorrow I'll cover it. But it deals with the fact that you can't play games with
[1:48:07.840 --> 1:48:17.200]  this. And nobody's coming to save you. The New World Order is attacking Western world, the idea
[1:48:17.200 --> 1:48:22.240]  of prosperity and freedom because they don't want that idea out there. That's why we're target number
[1:48:22.240 --> 1:48:26.640]  one because as bad as America is, we got big problems. Imagine all the other countries still
[1:48:26.640 --> 1:48:32.720]  under lockdown and forced inoculations. We're the best house, as they say, in a bad neighborhood.
[1:48:33.920 --> 1:48:43.040]  And so we have that information to cover. And it's incredibly central to everything collectively
[1:48:43.040 --> 1:48:50.000]  as a species that we are facing. And so I want to say a few things here in the final segment of
[1:48:50.000 --> 1:48:53.760]  this hour, I'll come back next hour and really place some powerful information and hand the
[1:48:53.760 --> 1:49:01.360]  baton to Troyer 30 minutes into the next hour. It's just this. I never know if this is my last
[1:49:01.360 --> 1:49:08.080]  broadcast. I never know if it's the last time I'm going to be able to talk to you. And I am
[1:49:08.080 --> 1:49:16.800]  extremely thankful for all of you, whether you are brown or pink or white or male or female,
[1:49:16.800 --> 1:49:24.400]  whatever it is, I love you. And you have a spirit and you are eternal and you're real and God made
[1:49:24.400 --> 1:49:29.200]  you and this planet's amazing and you're even more amazing. And we've got so much to do together.
[1:49:29.200 --> 1:49:35.760]  And I love this crew. And I look at people collaborating with the satanic system that
[1:49:35.760 --> 1:49:41.280]  lie to themselves about what they're involved in. And they pretend they're getting ahead by
[1:49:41.280 --> 1:49:47.920]  working with the system when all they're doing is destroying themselves. And so
[1:49:50.480 --> 1:49:56.960]  it's like that Elvis song. Maybe I never told you how much I needed you or loved you.
[1:49:58.400 --> 1:50:04.560]  We'll start the next hour or that, but you were always on my mind. And I think recognizing each
[1:50:04.560 --> 1:50:12.480]  other and recognizing our spirits, the transcend what color we are or where we came from, I think
[1:50:12.480 --> 1:50:22.560]  that I don't think I know that recognition is everything that God made us that were part of
[1:50:22.560 --> 1:50:36.080]  an amazing plan. And that we have a destiny to fulfill together. And that is so beautiful.
[1:50:36.080 --> 1:50:39.600]  That's really where we are. You know, I mentioned all this Bill Maher and I didn't get to it yet.
[1:50:39.600 --> 1:50:46.320]  Let's do it right now. Bill Maher says kids coming out as trans is because it's trendy
[1:50:46.320 --> 1:50:56.800]  and being gay is not hip enough. Disney releases LGBTQ P is what it is. Pedophile. Pride. Notice
[1:50:56.800 --> 1:51:04.160]  it's even P after it. Pride themed toys marketed to children. Oh, children. It's not about butterflies
[1:51:04.160 --> 1:51:12.480]  and birds and unicorns and fun and dinosaurs. It's about sex and your identity as a child
[1:51:12.480 --> 1:51:21.280]  sexually. That's pedophilia, that's raping consciousness. And then I've got the other
[1:51:21.280 --> 1:51:28.080]  headlines. California legislature reduces penalties for oral anal sex with willing children.
[1:51:28.080 --> 1:51:33.680]  As long as it's not vaginal and a baby might not happen, so what of you rape a 10 year old?
[1:51:33.680 --> 1:51:38.480]  It's their free will, but they don't have free will. They aren't of the age of consent. This
[1:51:38.480 --> 1:51:45.040]  is where we are. Not just the chemicals, not just the biologicals, but the cultural death.
[1:51:47.040 --> 1:51:52.320]  So here's Bill Maher saying, well, why are the conservative areas not having half the kids say
[1:51:52.320 --> 1:51:58.320]  they're trans? It's 2%. Well, the chemicals make them that way. And why is it liberal areas? Because
[1:51:58.320 --> 1:52:04.640]  they're recruiting. And Bill Maher's not perfect, but he knows where his audience is. He knows his
[1:52:04.640 --> 1:52:11.120]  audience even in blue states doesn't like this. A sexual relationship of the school and the state
[1:52:11.120 --> 1:52:18.960]  with a child about their sexual identity. I've got four children. I got a 19 year old son who's
[1:52:18.960 --> 1:52:26.800]  incredible. An 18 year old daughter who's amazing. A 14 year old daughter who is over the top incredible.
[1:52:26.800 --> 1:52:35.680]  And I've got a five year old daughter who is transcendent. And I've never sat there and told
[1:52:35.680 --> 1:52:41.840]  them about sex. I've never gotten because that's their own process as adults. This is a raping of
[1:52:41.840 --> 1:52:48.480]  the psyche. It is a sexual harassment of children. It is a molestation of their innocence and it is
[1:52:48.480 --> 1:52:55.920]  wrong. And it's happening and it's the sacrament of the satanic system to not just wreck our genes,
[1:52:55.920 --> 1:53:01.120]  not just wreck ourselves, but wreck our souls because those are there as well. And even more
[1:53:01.120 --> 1:53:09.200]  important. So even Bill Maher, when it comes down to the line, doesn't want to sign on to sexualizing
[1:53:09.200 --> 1:53:15.200]  five year olds in California all over. I saw dozens of articles this week where they harass
[1:53:15.200 --> 1:53:21.680]  elementary students because they quote use the wrong pronoun or didn't know the 56 pronouns.
[1:53:21.680 --> 1:53:28.320]  It may be 156 next week. And we sit here and let our children be targeted and be attacked and be
[1:53:28.320 --> 1:53:34.000]  demonized and be molested psychologically and spiritually preparing them for the main attack.
[1:53:35.840 --> 1:53:43.280]  Even Bill Maher has a soul. Even Bill Maher says leave the children alone and let the sands pass
[1:53:43.280 --> 1:53:49.600]  the law that elementary students shouldn't be told how to give a blow job or have anal sex.
[1:53:49.600 --> 1:53:58.400]  I don't talk to my children about that. My son's 19. He's had his own experiences, his own life.
[1:53:59.840 --> 1:54:06.720]  I don't sit there with my 18 or 19 year old son and say son, let me tell you.
[1:54:08.800 --> 1:54:14.800]  And then it just goes on from there. It's sick and it's evil and it's disgusting because they
[1:54:14.800 --> 1:54:19.520]  don't want you following your own instincts and what God made you to do. They want to kill us.
[1:54:19.520 --> 1:54:23.920]  They want to depopulate us. And if you sign on to this, aborting children after they're born
[1:54:23.920 --> 1:54:28.000]  with transhumanism and the trans movement to sterilize them. I mean, we hate some dude that
[1:54:28.000 --> 1:54:32.960]  thinks he's a woman and because of chemicals, it may actually be more a woman than a man.
[1:54:32.960 --> 1:54:38.400]  I don't hate those people. I love those people. But the forcing of it and the deriving of it
[1:54:38.400 --> 1:54:45.440]  is evil. And if you submit to it and if you give into it, you give up your humanity. And I will
[1:54:45.440 --> 1:54:49.280]  not be part of that. And you should make the decision right now whether you're part of it or not.
[1:54:49.280 --> 1:54:56.800]  Here's Bill Maher. This issue. Yes, part of the rise in LGBT numbers is from people feeling free
[1:54:56.800 --> 1:55:03.040]  enough to tell it to a pollster. And that's all to the good. But some of it is it's trendy.
[1:55:03.040 --> 1:55:13.040]  Hey, penis equals man. Okay, boomer. Remember, the prime directive of every teen is anything to
[1:55:13.040 --> 1:55:18.800]  shock and challenge the squares who brought you up. It's why nobody gets a nose ring at 56.
[1:55:26.160 --> 1:55:29.920]  And if you haven't noticed that with kids doing something for the likes
[1:55:29.920 --> 1:55:36.160]  is more important than their own genitals, you haven't been paying attention. Dr. Erica Anderson
[1:55:36.160 --> 1:55:42.720]  is a prominent 71 year old clinical psychologist who is her self transgender and who now says,
[1:55:42.720 --> 1:55:49.440]  I think it's gone too far. The LA Times summarizes, she's come to believe that some children identifying
[1:55:49.440 --> 1:55:55.760]  as trans are falling under the influence of their peers and social media. If you attend a small
[1:55:55.760 --> 1:56:02.720]  dinner party of typically very liberal upper income Angelenos, it is not uncommon to hear parents who
[1:56:02.720 --> 1:56:08.560]  each have a trans kid having a conversation about that. What are the odds of that happening in
[1:56:08.560 --> 1:56:15.280]  Youngstown, Ohio? If this spike in trans children is all natural, why is it regional?
[1:56:15.280 --> 1:56:26.800]  No, either Ohio is shaming them or California is creating them.
[1:56:26.800 --> 1:56:31.360]  All right, the full clip. It's like that day. We suddenly all the full clips on info wars.com.
[1:56:31.360 --> 1:56:37.120]  But the point is, this is really just the establishment knowing they woke folks up.
[1:56:37.120 --> 1:56:41.040]  So they move the original window over to sterilize all the children. It's like, no,
[1:56:41.040 --> 1:56:44.960]  no, let's just sterilize some of them. Let's be reasonable and you're already caught
[1:56:44.960 --> 1:56:49.360]  in their net. And I'm not saying Bill Maher is sophisticated enough to do that because I know
[1:56:49.360 --> 1:56:53.520]  people that know him well and are friends with him and he really doesn't know all this stuff.
[1:56:53.520 --> 1:56:57.760]  But I think he's starting to get it. I think Elon Musk is starting to get it.
[1:56:57.760 --> 1:57:03.360]  Or they should get it because this is spiritual death. You want to cut your genitals off as an
[1:57:03.360 --> 1:57:09.280]  adult? You want to drink Drano? You want to blow your head off? I hope you don't. But damn it,
[1:57:09.280 --> 1:57:15.680]  don't lead children into it or you are bad and there is justice in the universe and you will pay.
[1:57:15.680 --> 1:57:22.880]  And everybody knows at their core, right down to the bottom, baby, that it's wrong.
[1:57:23.440 --> 1:57:28.560]  Hour number three and four. Coming up with myself and I'm a shroyer. I'm going to air
[1:57:28.560 --> 1:57:32.560]  badass Uncle Sam footage and more. Your station doesn't carry the next two hours.

[1:58:54.240 --> 1:58:58.880]  the food. It's all come out and they're doing that not because we're weak, but because we're
[1:58:58.880 --> 1:59:05.280]  made the image of God, the creator and we are powerful and the social engineers fear that so
[1:59:05.280 --> 1:59:10.480]  much. So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up with
[1:59:10.480 --> 1:59:20.160]  the boy. Is it true? The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless. They need
[1:59:20.160 --> 1:59:25.280]  all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural death because
[1:59:26.080 --> 1:59:31.680]  they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on the God of this world who is a
[1:59:31.680 --> 1:59:35.840]  loser. And that's why it's so important that everybody keep info wars in the air now more than
[1:59:35.840 --> 1:59:41.040]  ever because even you don't believe in God, but the globalist are manifesting and setting up is
[1:59:41.040 --> 1:59:51.440]  safe and we are opposing the one world government and the market. If you are receiving this transmission
[1:59:51.440 --> 2:00:12.000]  you are the resistance.
