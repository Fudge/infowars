[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:14.720]   - Infowars.com is tomorrow's news.
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.960]   Today, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:26.900]   - Well, ladies and gentlemen, it is The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.360]   Alex Jones will be joining us here in just a moment.
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.180]   It is Thursday, June 14th, 2018.
[00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.460]   It is President Trump's birthday,
[00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.040]   and it is the 34-hour broadcast spectacular
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.160]   here at infowars.com/show.
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.160]   We are expecting the release of the IG report
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.280]   shortly as well, but before we get to that,
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.400]   in case you didn't think that the Democrats
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.340]   have lost their mind, here's a little more evidence for you.
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.240]   - In just a few years, he'll be in school,
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.440]   and Donald Trump wants to give his teacher a gun?
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.820]   - More students have been killed in school shootings
[00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.540]   in 2018 than US troops in combat operations.
[00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.980]   We need common sense gun control, but that's not enough.
[00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.620]   There are 310 million guns in the US
[00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.620]   and millions of assault-style weapons.
[00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.620]   - I'm Levi Tilleman.
[00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.780]   Washington needs more doers and innovators.
[00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.360]   That's why I'm running for US Congress.
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.920]   I'm calling on Congress to stop talking past each other
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.960]   and try something new.
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.760]   Empower schools and teachers-
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.520]   - So far, not too bad.
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.680]   - With non-lethal self-defense tools
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.160]   like this can of pepper spray.
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.000]   - Wait, what?
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.040]   - Pepper spray doesn't cost much,
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.440]   and it can be safely stored in a brake glass
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.400]   in case of emergency cabinet.
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.740]   But it's powerful and won't accidentally kill a kid.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.880]   Trust me, this will stop anyone in their tracks.
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.380]   (guns firing)
[00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.540]   - Go back to the guy.
[00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.220]   You cut away for the best part.
[00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.060]   - It's incredibly painful.
[00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.900]   - So there he is.
[00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.180]   - I can't see anything.
[00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.460]   - A Democrat candidate sprays himself.
[00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.260]   This is in Colorado.
[00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.900]   Can we rewind it to when he has it all over his face?
[00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.500]   This is so absurd.
[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.840]   I can't even imagine whose idea this was.
[00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.420]   - Roger Stone, you have been in politics
[00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.800]   for a long, long time.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.940]   Have you ever seen a more ridiculous campaign ad?
[00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.460]   - Well, the only thing worse than being wrong in politics
[00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.680]   is being boring, and this is most certainly not boring.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.380]   It's so ridiculous that it will get media coverage.
[00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.040]   It'll get him earned media coverage.
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.900]   It's the same take their guns underlying theme.
[00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.780]   All Democrats are running against,
[00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.780]   but this is an underfunded guy
[00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:53.980]   trying to get on television.
[00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.340]   It's how I read it.
[00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.180]   - So, but I kind of think,
[00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.900]   you might actually think this is brilliant.
[00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.380]   You think this might actually get him
[00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.260]   the right kind of publicity he's looking for.
[00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.340]   - Well, I don't think the idea of pepper spray
[00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.740]   is a great idea.
[00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.140]   What I'm talking about is the theatrics
[00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.980]   of spraying yourself in the face
[00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.140]   to make sure that the local news
[00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.000]   and that market picks up his spot,
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.540]   or that maybe InfoWars would even show it.
[00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.020]   - Hey, you know what?
[00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.740]   I think it's funny that they don't want you
[00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.820]   to have the right to protect yourself.
[00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.780]   I think it's funny that they demonize the fact
[00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.180]   that this country has guns to protect itself
[00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.020]   in a Second Amendment.
[00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.300]   That's what's kept it free.
[00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.940]   But then I just think it's crazy
[00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.760]   that a guy would pepper spray himself in the face
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.980]   for a campaign ad, but I guess it was effective.
[00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.500]   He gets the views he wants.
[00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.040]   We'll see if it works out for him,
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.820]   but I just think this is more evidence
[00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.700]   of the Democrats just totally losing their minds,
[00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.620]   and they just don't know what to do anymore.
[00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.720]   - Well, let's check tomorrow and see on YouTube
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.860]   how many views he's got.
[00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.100]   I think that'll tell you the reason he did this.
[00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.580]   But I don't know, I feel like he,
[00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.700]   maybe he's just in it for YouTube views,
[00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.180]   but if you're in it to win an election,
[00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.980]   I don't know if this is the way to go.
[00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.820]   I guess this is the new thing.
[00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.460]   Can you torture yourself into a congressional seat?
[00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.700]   - I don't know what the registration looks like
[00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.780]   in the district that he's running in.
[00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.460]   It's a publicity stunt,
[00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.980]   and maybe it will appeal to leftists.
[00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.960]   I think he gets a lot of views out of it.
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.440]   I'm not sure he gets a lot of votes out of it.
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.680]   - All right, well, we start the show
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.920]   a little lighthearted today,
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.400]   but we do have a lot of important news to cover.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.400]   You've got a new New York attorney general
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.980]   who is trying to shut down the Trump Foundation.
[00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.000]   This is Barbara Underwood.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.520]   Underwood, that's from House of Cards.
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.640]   This is the replacement Eric Schneiderman.
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.680]   It is now Barbara Schneiderwoman.
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.040]   But you notice how after Schneiderman was out,
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.760]   Weinstein fell, and a lot of other pieces fell in New York.
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.440]   I wonder if Schneiderman had anything to do with that.
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.980]   We'll be right back on the other side.
[00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:57.820]   Don't go anywhere.
[00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.600]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.120]   - Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut

[00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:12.380]   it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.160]   (dramatic music)
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.900]   (dramatic music)
[00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.640]   (dramatic music)
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.380]   (dramatic music)
[00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.120]   (dramatic music)
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.480]   - It's Thursday, June 14th, 2018.
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:55.660]   This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.200]   Owen Schroeder, Roger Stone in studio.
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:02.160]   Alex will be in studio very shortly.
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.320]   We've got Scott Adams lined up.
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.120]   He is going to be joining us.
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:10.760]   Shiva Ayyadurai has breaking news at one o'clock central,
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.120]   and then Doug Hagman takes over the fourth hour.
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.480]   I'm sure he's got his feelers out there
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.640]   as far as the IG report is concerned
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.480]   about what to expect coming out of that.
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.480]   Of course, Roger, we were talking about
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.660]   before the show today,
[00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:28.520]   what we expect to see from the IG report
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.000]   is going to be more of what we already know,
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.440]   and that's that the Hillary Clinton email investigation
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.840]   was rigged, was cooked, and James Comey was the one
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:40.280]   behind it, but maybe, maybe not, do we find out
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.840]   if anybody else from the Obama administration
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:45.240]   is behind that, but on the heels of this release,
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.720]   is that what you're expecting?
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.960]   Is that what you think we already know, though,
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:49.800]   is gonna come out?
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.120]   - We know that James Comey wrote his report
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.760]   two months before he completed the investigation,
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.200]   so this was cooked from the beginning.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.060]   We know that he reopened the investigation
[00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:03.300]   into Hillary's emails only because he knew
[00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:06.560]   the New York Police Department had just uncovered
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:11.560]   650,000 emails on Huma Abedin,
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:15.100]   Hillary's right-hand woman, on her server,
[00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:16.840]   and therefore, if he didn't act,
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.560]   the New York Police Department would,
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:21.760]   so he kind of had no choice, but this is not gonna speak
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.120]   to some of the larger questions, for example,
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:28.040]   the illegal and unconstitutional use of FISA warrants,
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:33.040]   the infiltration of the Trump campaign with FBI spies.
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:37.480]   It just shows you how much the scandal has moved on
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.180]   from the original questions.
[00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:42.080]   This inspector general has a lot on his plate
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.160]   that he has to look into, plus, remember,
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:48.000]   we still have that US attorney in Utah, Huber,
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.520]   who's supposed to be looking into the FISA abuses,
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.120]   and we have no report yet from him.
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.600]   - Well, and right now, the Department of Justice is,
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.720]   and I guess the FISA courts are not releasing
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:02.780]   those documents as far as the FISA warrants were concerned,
[00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:04.540]   and as far as the FBI spies were concerned
[00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:06.880]   or when that started, they're not releasing those
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.960]   to Devin Nunes, he's made dozens of requests,
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.040]   they're not releasing those to the intelligence committees
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.320]   in the House or the Senate, even though
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.800]   they've made requests, so right now,
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.080]   they're getting denied access to those documents,
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.880]   which would push that investigation further
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:23.080]   as to the origins of the spies in the Trump campaign
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:27.040]   and the FISA warrants, but to come back to the IG report,
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.400]   I guess the one thing I'm hoping could come from this,
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.560]   and I don't think, maybe we learn something new from it,
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:36.080]   maybe we don't, however, if it becomes undeniable fact
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.840]   and we have a Justice Department that's willing to act,
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:42.720]   do you believe that they would have a new investigation
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.880]   into Hillary Clinton's emails and the server
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.320]   and perhaps even prosecute her?
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.600]   - I think it's gonna depend on what else is there
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.480]   that we don't know, you notice that Jeff Sessions,
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:55.700]   the Attorney General, kind of laid the predicate
[00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.660]   by saying, now, if we find that other people
[00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:00.680]   did things wrong, we're gonna have no problem firing them.
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.120]   Seems to me like he knows something,
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.080]   so until we see what we have, I don't think we can tell
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.740]   what the political impact of it will be.
[00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:12.400]   At the end of the day, I still think
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:17.160]   it is the larger questions that Nunes is trying to get into
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.520]   that are more important, and liberals keep telling us,
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.580]   oh, there's gonna be a constitutional crisis.
[00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:25.000]   Well, they're right, that's it right there.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.320]   When a co-equal branch of government
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.920]   is being denied information
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.260]   by a politicized Justice Department,
[00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.400]   there's your constitutional crisis.
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.280]   - Here's a constitutional crisis.
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:38.760]   When you have, is that, I'm sorry,
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.160]   I just got distracted, of Eric Cartman,
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.160]   but I guess Jeff Sessions on the screen there,
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.000]   sorry about that.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.080]   (clears throat)
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.760]   Here's a constitutional crisis to me, Roger.
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:51.800]   The DOJ, the FBI, the CIA, the NSA
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.500]   are not in the Constitution,
[00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.780]   and they're running this country under Obama.
[00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:58.180]   They're spying on people illegally under Obama,
[00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:00.700]   and years before that, too, but we just have this case,
[00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:02.280]   and we have the facts on it now.
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:04.080]   So that's a constitutional crisis to me,
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.720]   but they don't wanna talk about that.
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:10.040]   Meanwhile, though, we move over to another track here.
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:12.000]   You've got Robert Mueller.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.680]   You've got Robert Mueller who indicts the Russians.
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:15.720]   They show up to court.
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:16.960]   He refuses discovery.
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.440]   He refuses to show up in court.
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:21.120]   Then he says, well, I can't show up yet
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.120]   because I'm still building a case against them.
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.080]   They're still meddling.
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.880]   Well, that doesn't make sense.
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.200]   Anyone would tell you, you don't indict someone
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.520]   till you have all the evidence.
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:31.680]   So why would he be still gathering evidence
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:32.880]   after the indictment?
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.640]   Then you have the Cohen story, Roger,
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.120]   which I don't understand.
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.000]   Why would Michael Cohen,
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.600]   who they're saying is going to flip,
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:40.520]   that's the new narrative,
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:42.000]   Cohen's gonna flip on Trump.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.600]   Well, then why would he be looking for legal counsel?
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.440]   That doesn't make sense.
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.120]   You wouldn't be looking for legal counsel
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.400]   if you were going to flip.
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:51.280]   - Let's take these one at a time.
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:52.880]   On the question of Cohen,
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:57.040]   this is a media fable that he's gonna flip.
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.680]   That's like a prognostication.
[00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:01.040]   He has said nothing of the kind.
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.080]   I saw Mayor Giuliani on with Laura Ingram,
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.560]   an excellent interview in which he said,
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.080]   look, there's nothing that Michael Cohen could say
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.640]   that the president fears.
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:13.840]   We don't think that he has animosity towards the president.
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:18.840]   So this is, again, the media jumping way ahead.
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.240]   - And now what about Mueller?
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.360]   Why isn't Mueller showing up in court?
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.920]   And why is there no outrage
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:25.840]   that Mueller is obstructing justice?
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.280]   - It's really extraordinary.
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:30.320]   He clearly never expected the Russians to show up for trial.
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:31.160]   - None of us did.
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:32.000]   - Right, so--
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.200]   - The Russians are beating everyone right now.
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.560]   - So he charged the Russians to get a headline
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:40.000]   because he had no Russian interference in the election
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.080]   to point to, it was hurting his public relations image.
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:46.720]   Now, it is a fundamental bedrock principle
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.920]   of American jurisprudence that people who are charged
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:52.800]   be allowed to see the evidence against them.
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.680]   And he doesn't want to produce it.
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:57.120]   Perhaps that's because he doesn't have it.
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:00.280]   And as you point out, if the investigation is ongoing,
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.360]   then why did he already bring the indictments?
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:05.960]   No, I think that this is why a new poll two days ago
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:09.320]   shows that his disapproval has now hit 53.
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.360]   It was 26 a year ago.
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:16.120]   I think people are fed up with the political partisan nature
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:18.720]   of this investigation and the fact that he just keeps
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:22.760]   dragging it out without any evidence of Russian collusion.
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.840]   - And it's costing us millions of dollars now,
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:27.360]   which, by the way, the White House has just extended
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:31.440]   $6.6 million back to the White Helmets in Syria.
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.640]   That got announced today as well.
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:35.800]   This is something I don't support.
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:39.120]   So we report the things that happen here at InfoWars,
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.040]   whether we like them or not.
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:42.320]   But I don't know, guys, if you want to find that story.
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.480]   I forgot to print that out.
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.280]   Just real quick and some other news.
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:50.880]   The new AG in New York, Underwood,
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.360]   is trying to shut down the Trump Foundation.
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:55.120]   They've become totally unhinged.
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:58.740]   If you threaten to kill Senator Sanders or Senator Harris,
[00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:00.440]   the Democrats, then you get charged.
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:04.040]   But if you threaten to kill Trump or Ajit Pai or Mike Pence
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:07.640]   or anybody like that, Dinesh D'Souza, that's okay.
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:10.000]   Kim Kardashian West pushes for White House
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.320]   more drug sentence commutations.
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:15.680]   Well, maybe that would work if Obama wasn't blackballing
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:19.040]   in negotiations and conversations and talks
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:21.280]   between other people that want prison reform
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:22.120]   and President Trump.
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:23.600]   That's Obama behind that.
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:26.280]   But in the meantime, before we get to the next segment,
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:27.760]   before Alex Jones joins us, ladies and gentlemen,

[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:47.800]   - We gotta get this out,
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:49.160]   because just 'cause you're awake, folks,
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:50.440]   doesn't mean other people are.

[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.480]   to give to the library, to give to the church.

[00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:25.560]   Live from the InfoWars.com studios,
[00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:28.560]   you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:36.820]   - All right, we've got a lot to talk about here.
[00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:39.360]   Alex Jones is gonna be joining us here shortly.
[00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:42.440]   Roger and I were speaking during the break.
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:46.160]   You've got this new attorney general in New York.
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.160]   She's trying to shut down the Trump administration,
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.760]   Barbara Underwood.
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:52.240]   Imagine my shock, Roger, not only is this a woman
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.960]   that worked for Bill Clinton and George Bush,
[00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:56.840]   but she's a graduate of Harvard Law,
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:57.960]   just like the rest of them. - I'm surprised.
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:59.400]   - I know, imagine my shock.
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.180]   - Well, we recognize that this woman was selected
[00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:05.240]   by the legislature for an appointment that nobody wanted
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:08.080]   'cause everyone understood that the imprimatur
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:12.480]   of being an elected state official in New York State
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:16.280]   would be poison if you wanted to run for this office.
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:18.760]   This investigation into the Trump Foundation
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:21.240]   was cooked up under Eric Schneiderman,
[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:24.120]   who was trying to use his attacks on Trump
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:29.120]   to build the basis for a gubernatorial campaign of his own.
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:31.320]   And how ironic that she announces this
[00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:35.120]   at the exact same time that the inspector general's report
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:36.240]   is being released.
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:38.200]   How coincidental.
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:41.640]   This is just pure, raw politics.
[00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.640]   - Well, and it's just amazing to me
[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:46.800]   that the Trump Foundation now is the target
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:49.720]   of an investigation, but the Clinton Foundation,
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:53.520]   which has been operating for decades,
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.680]   who knows where these funds are going?
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:58.080]   I mean, who knows what happens to all that money
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.200]   for the Haitians?
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.480]   We do know where Chelsea Clinton Hubbell
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:04.720]   got her wedding dress, thanks to your donations,
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.880]   but no investigation into that, Roger.
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:09.200]   - Well, in fact, Haitian American groups
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:11.920]   have repeatedly asked the New York Attorney General
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:15.000]   to look into the activities of the Clinton Foundation
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.380]   in Haiti, and they have refused,
[00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:19.880]   because it's not politically correct.
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:22.120]   But if you can bash Donald Trump and his children
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:25.380]   and his family, even though his foundation gave out
[00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:27.840]   essentially more money than they took in
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:30.920]   with the president himself subsidizing it,
[00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:33.960]   no, that's politically perfect.
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:38.240]   - Well, they were so broke, though, Roger.
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:39.680]   I mean, they both said it, they were broke
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:40.560]   when they left the White House.
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:42.680]   In fact, they were so broke that they had to steal
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:44.740]   the silverware and the furniture
[00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:46.160]   right from the White House grounds.
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.740]   - And were forced to return it,
[00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:49.520]   which all of which you can read a course about
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:51.720]   in the Clinton's war on women.
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:53.360]   It's amazing to me the way the Clintons
[00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:56.400]   want to relitigate everything from the beginning.
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:23:00.120]   Oh, you know, Monica, that's about infidelity
[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:01.000]   and indiscretion.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:01.820]   No, it isn't.
[00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:05.580]   The issue here is rape, violence against women.
[00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:08.380]   It's outrageous that Juanita Broderick's book
[00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:10.020]   suddenly disappears from Kindle,
[00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:12.180]   can no longer be purchased.
[00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:14.900]   The coverup just continues here,
[00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:18.500]   and they want to keep redefining this again and again
[00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:20.840]   as if the American people didn't figure it out
[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.020]   in the last election.
[00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:24.000]   - Well, I think we're breaking their backs now,
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.640]   because we just did the protest of Bill Clinton here
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:30.500]   where we had dozens of people outside protesting.
[00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:33.860]   We had five infiltrators that got into the event
[00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:35.420]   that shouted down Bill Clinton.
[00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:37.460]   You had another gentleman do it in Philadelphia.
[00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:40.620]   I think Clinton's last book tour date is actually today.
[00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:42.060]   I'm not sure where he is.
[00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:44.500]   But I think that he's really starting to break.
[00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:46.220]   Listen to this clip, Roger.
[00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:47.820]   This is pretty incredible that Bill Clinton
[00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:48.660]   would admit this.
[00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:50.220]   Again, I think it's just a sign
[00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:51.780]   that he really is breaking down.
[00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:55.140]   Listen to what Bill Clinton says on the PBS NewsHour.
[00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:58.060]   - I think the norms have really changed
[00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:02.820]   in terms of what you can do to somebody against their will,
[00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:04.320]   how much you can crowd their space,
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:05.940]   make them miserable at work.
[00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:08.340]   You don't have to physically assault somebody
[00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:13.340]   to make them uncomfortable at work or at home
[00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:16.520]   or in their utter, just walking around.
[00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:18.900]   - I mean, what is that?
[00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:19.740]   - That's incredible.
[00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:22.340]   So in other words, it used to be okay to assault women,
[00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:23.460]   but today it's not?
[00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:24.420]   Is that what he's saying?
[00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:27.220]   Look, this is a guy who bit through the upper lip
[00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:28.420]   of his victims.
[00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:32.380]   This is a guy who forced himself, exposed himself
[00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:35.020]   and raped multiple women.
[00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:37.780]   And he keeps trying to redefine it for us.
[00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:41.220]   Like just because they were able to contain it in the '80s,
[00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:43.660]   it cannot be contained anymore.
[00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:45.940]   And no, attitudes have not changed.
[00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:49.120]   Rape was wrong then, rape is wrong now.
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:54.540]   - It's incredible that Hollywood and the Democrats,
[00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:56.740]   and well, okay, you look at the Democrats
[00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:58.500]   and you can really just point out Bill Clinton.
[00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:01.140]   I mean, 'cause they protected him for so long.
[00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:03.140]   The list can go on, there's Republicans on that too.
[00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:06.180]   But the Democrats are the ones that virtue signal for women.
[00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:10.220]   Hollywood is the group that virtue signals for women.
[00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:12.580]   All the me too originates in Hollywood
[00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:14.540]   and at Bill Clinton's Oval Office, Roger.
[00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:17.300]   I mean, how do these people get away with it?
[00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:19.460]   And then they actually get people to go pay
[00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:22.020]   hundreds of dollars to see Bill Clinton speak.
[00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:25.820]   - What's the amazing thing is that Democrats must cringe
[00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:27.740]   every time they see one of the Clintons
[00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:29.380]   approach a TV camera.
[00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:32.580]   They just wish they would ride off into the sunset
[00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:34.260]   with their stolen money.
[00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:36.220]   But obviously it's not enough.
[00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:38.380]   I mean, Bill is estimated to be worth
[00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:40.820]   somewhere around $300 million.
[00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:44.660]   His son, Danny Williams, works in a meat packing plant
[00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:47.940]   by day and at a 7-Eleven at night
[00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:50.380]   to make ends meet for his five children,
[00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:54.060]   while his father is worth $300 million.
[00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:54.900]   - That we know of.
[00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:56.780]   - These people have no shame.
[00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:58.820]   - Well, and Danny Williams is actually gonna be joining me
[00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:02.900]   on the war room and you later on the war room as well,
[00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:04.460]   3 to 6 p.m. Central here.
[00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:06.380]   And we're gonna celebrate Father's Day.
[00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:08.260]   We're gonna see if Bill Clinton is ready
[00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:11.100]   to celebrate Father's Day with his son, Danny Williams.
[00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:14.580]   Really, Bill Clinton's only offspring that we know of.
[00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:17.860]   I mean, Chelsea Hubble, that doesn't really count.
[00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:19.660]   - I really think if nothing else,
[00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:21.300]   Bill Clinton may have learned this week
[00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:24.140]   that it's time for him to come off the circuit.
[00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:27.300]   I suspect he wakes up every morning and wonders,
[00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:30.140]   gee, I wonder where Laura Loomer is today.
[00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:33.580]   I don't think he can pull this off anymore.
[00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:35.340]   It's just not working.
[00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:40.340]   And his weak denials, defenses are pathetic.
[00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:42.620]   - Well, he did have to cancel
[00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:45.600]   at least one of his book tour events.
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:46.800]   I'm not sure if it was more than that,
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:48.820]   but he did have to cancel at least one.
[00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:51.340]   Meanwhile, though, the Democrats
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:54.460]   are saying it's time for Obama
[00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:55.900]   to return from the sidelines.
[00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:59.240]   But see, I think Obama, unlike the Clintons,
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:01.020]   is actually a little more savvy now,
[00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:04.580]   and he realizes that he is much better off behind the scenes,
[00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:06.300]   much better off not showing his face,
[00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:07.980]   not making public comment,
[00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:10.700]   because he actually is under so much scrutiny
[00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:14.380]   for all the illegality and unethics
[00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:17.100]   that happened in his administration.
[00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:21.580]   - The obvious question regarding the dossier
[00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:24.040]   that was used, a fabricated dossier
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:27.360]   that was used to rationalize the surveillance
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:30.100]   of the Republican candidate for president,
[00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:32.920]   a question that is raised
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:36.600]   by Peter Stroke's text message is simple.
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:39.580]   What did the president know, and when did he know it?
[00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:41.800]   Sooner or later, he ought to be required
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:46.040]   to sit before Congress under oath and answer that question.
[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:49.000]   It looks to me like the old Italian saying,
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.520]   a fish rots from the head,
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:54.320]   and it looks to me like he has culpability
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:58.000]   in the biggest political scandal in American history,
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.160]   something that makes Watergate
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:02.240]   look like a second-rate burglary.
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:06.860]   - And hopefully this all makes headway sometime,
[00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:09.260]   and the president addresses this with,
[00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:10.840]   I think, legal, active,
[00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:14.580]   something needs to happen to these people,
[00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:16.280]   whether it's somebody going to jail,
[00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:20.360]   whether it's at least starting with a testimony under oath.
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:21.760]   I mean, that would be nice
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:24.120]   if they could just get somebody to testify under oath
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:29.000]   about what truly started the spying onto the Trump campaign,
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.840]   because they admit that that happened now, Roger,
[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:33.560]   so they can't put that cat back in the bag.
[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:35.840]   As many different terms that they wanna use,
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:38.160]   oh, it was just an intelligence resource,
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:39.720]   oh, that was just an officer,
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:43.480]   oh, he was helping Trump, give me a break,
[00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:45.600]   give me a break, nobody is buying that.
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:47.240]   So we'll see if it all comes out,
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:50.840]   but the Inspector General report is set to launch soon,
[00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:55.080]   and it will most likely show how James Comey was,
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.160]   well, let's just say not behaving fairly.
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:02.880]   - I tried other brands, but I came back to my sunshine.
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:05.680]   - For the best hot or cold pain relief, get the best.
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:07.560]   Get a Sunny Bay heating pad.
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:10.600]   - Sometimes life can be a pain in the neck,
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:12.640]   or back, or shoulder.
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:14.040]   - And the best relief for that pain
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:15.960]   is a Sunny Bay heating pad.
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:18.520]   Did you know that the American College of Physicians
[00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:20.920]   said that one of the best ways to treat muscle pain
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:22.200]   is heat therapy?
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:25.400]   Sunny Bay heating pads are handmade with high quality,
[00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:27.160]   can be used at home or at work,

[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:35.880]   - Many people use our Sunny Bay heating pads alone
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:37.400]   and got rid of the neck pain.
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:40.440]   - Long distance travel or long hours in front of a computer
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.120]   can take its toll on your body.

[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:07.080]   But sometimes supplements don't work fast enough.

[00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:08.640]   or even simple power outages,

[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:02.720]   - Living in Volcano may sound more dramatic
[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:04.040]   than it really is.
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:07.320]   The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:10.120]   But a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater,
[00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:13.520]   and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:17.040]   Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles,
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:19.480]   and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:20.840]   to unhealthy levels.
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:23.800]   To find out, we employed a series of tests
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:27.360]   for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:29.200]   What we learned was that there was in fact
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:31.600]   unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:33.040]   in the rainwater.
[00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:34.640]   Next, we tested the water
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:36.960]   from our Alexa Pure Gravity Filter.
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.920]   And not only were the heavy metal levels
[00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:40.520]   within safe measure,
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:44.120]   but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:47.160]   As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:49.480]   raises the pH of the water.
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:51.680]   So what we've learned is that volcanic ash
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:55.080]   and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:56.480]   But more importantly,
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:59.280]   a good water filtration system will purify it.
[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:06.360]   - You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:08.680]   (whooshing)
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:13.880]   (upbeat music)
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:21.120]   - You found it, the tip of the spear.
[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:26.120]   It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:28.760]   (upbeat music)
[00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:35.840]   - So Trump has had some obstacles
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:39.600]   in trying to have this summit with Kim Jong-un.
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:43.200]   Now, the first obstacle was John Bolton.
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:44.520]   Now, we're not sure.
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:46.960]   It's been speculated that John Bolton
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:51.600]   was playing bad cop to get the negotiations
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:55.000]   to a certain point, and then he backed off,
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.640]   and then Trump came in and got the summit back on.
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:01.560]   Why was John Bolton saying that we were gonna use
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:02.400]   the Libyan model?
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.360]   Was he trying to sabotage the deal?
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:05.600]   Was he playing bad cop?
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:08.480]   Was it just bad structure of sentence?
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:09.880]   I don't know.
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:11.680]   That happens.
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:14.680]   And so then you have Lindsey Graham
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:19.640]   just the day before the summit saying that,
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:21.640]   basically, if Kim doesn't denuclearize,
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:22.880]   I think he said we were going to go
[00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:24.120]   with the Libyan model again.
[00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:26.840]   I'm not sure exactly, but the point is,
[00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:30.160]   you had Bolton that didn't really seem to help it,
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:32.160]   and then you had Lindsey Graham
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:33.320]   that didn't really seem to help it.
[00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:35.400]   So this is how Rand Paul responded to that.
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:38.080]   Let's go to clip 14 first.
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:40.920]   This is Rand Paul responding on Fox News
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:44.200]   to what Bolton potentially did to the deal.
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:47.080]   - The neocons would never offer any carrot
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:48.880]   because they're all about the stick,
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:51.400]   and they want everybody to just kneel down and behave.
[00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:54.200]   - But one of those neocons, Senator, is at the table.
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:55.520]   John Bolton was at the table.
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:57.760]   I'm sure the president had that by design.
[00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:59.160]   Of course, Mike Pompeo was there as well,
[00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:00.320]   and others were there.
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:02.040]   But why do you think he did that?
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:04.360]   Because, of course, the North Koreans
[00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:06.360]   were apoplectic over his Libya comments,
[00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:09.160]   as you alluded to, and yet there he was.
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:10.640]   What did you make of it?
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:12.680]   - My hope is that he was at the children's table
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:15.440]   and that he wasn't influencing discussion among adults.
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:18.240]   - I think he was at the main table.
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:21.160]   - That's a pretty, kind of a bit of a jab there
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:23.360]   to John Bolton from Rand Paul, Roger.
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:25.160]   - What's really amazing here, though, Owen,
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:29.680]   is the way liberals would like these negotiations
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:32.640]   to fall apart because they're conducted by Donald Trump.
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:36.640]   This reminds me of, in President Nixon's second term,
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:39.040]   he reached a historic SALT agreement,
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:41.560]   Strategic Arms Limitation Agreement.
[00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:42.480]   Liberals, you would have thought,
[00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:43.560]   would have been happy about that,
[00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:45.320]   but they didn't like it 'cause Nixon did it.
[00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:46.200]   It's the same thing here.
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:47.840]   This is the art of the deal.
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:50.320]   Trump's been very cautious from the beginning.
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:53.400]   He always said, "Maybe we'll have a deal, maybe we won't.
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:54.800]   "Sure, it'd be great if we did,
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:56.840]   "but if we don't, that's okay, too."
[00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:58.320]   He also carefully said,
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:00.840]   "This isn't all gonna happen in one meeting.
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:02.320]   "This is a process.
[00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:05.280]   "This guy is a master negotiator,
[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:09.240]   "and he will get his way on this, but he's also no sucker.
[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:11.160]   "We're not gonna sign something
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:13.800]   "where they're gonna evade their responsibilities."
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:17.680]   So the old Reagan trust but verify,
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:19.680]   I think, will be the watchword in this deal
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:21.000]   in the final analysis.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.040]   - Well, and then that's an amazing,
[00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:24.000]   I don't know what show this was on.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.840]   I guess that hack comedian that hacked it up
[00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:31.400]   at the Correspondents' Dinner, they did a poll.
[00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:35.840]   Are you sort of hoping we don't get peace with North Korea
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:38.080]   so you wouldn't have to give Trump credit?
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:39.840]   71% say yes.
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:40.680]   Yeah, that's the thing.
[00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:43.640]   Their hatred for Trump is so deep-seated
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:44.480]   that they'd rather,
[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:46.880]   it's the whole cut off your nose to spite your face.
[00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:48.640]   Michelle Wolf is this hack's name.
[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:51.600]   We'll just call her the Wolf.
[00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:54.800]   So the Wolf has a poll, and people say,
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.320]   yeah, they don't want peace with North Korea
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:57.560]   'cause then they have to give Trump credit,
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:36:59.920]   again, to cut off your nose to spite your face.
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:01.000]   But Roger, let's not recall.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:05.680]   I mean, you go back, what were the liberals saying?
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:07.480]   Oh, Trump's gonna start a war.
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:08.560]   He's so bad.
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:10.280]   Why is Trump trying to start a war?
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:11.880]   Why is Trump saying this to North Korea?
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:13.240]   Why is he doing this to North Korea?
[00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:15.240]   He's so bad, he's gonna start war.
[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:18.080]   And they were mad that Trump wasn't gonna get peace done
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:18.960]   with North Korea.
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:20.560]   Oh, then he has the summit.
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:22.320]   He's the first president to meet with North Korea.
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:24.640]   Now he's moving towards peace, and what do they say?
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:27.240]   Oh, how dare he meet with North Korea?
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:29.360]   How dare he meet with the evil Kim Jong-un?
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:31.000]   How dare he get peace?
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.280]   It's Trump derangement syndrome.
[00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:37.560]   Of all people, you would think liberals would be happy
[00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:40.480]   about the denuclearization and the peace process.
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:42.760]   That used to be, what was it, '70s and '80s, Roger,
[00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:44.600]   when denuclearization was number one
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:45.440]   on the Democrat platform?
[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:46.920]   Exactly, the nuclear freeze.
[00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:48.520]   Remember, that was their big thing.
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:51.000]   Now, Trump very skillfully does
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.880]   what three previous presidents could not do.
[00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:56.200]   The saber-rattling that they all denounced
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:58.680]   is what gets them to the table,
[00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:01.680]   and he's on the cusp of a historic peace deal,
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:04.440]   and they can't stand it because it's Donald Trump,
[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:06.880]   just because it's Donald Trump.
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:10.360]   - Now let's go to Rand Paul responding to Lindsey Graham
[00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:13.640]   and his statements that could have perhaps been an obstacle
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:15.320]   to the Trump-Kim summit.
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:18.760]   - The president hasn't made any military threats
[00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:20.440]   going into the summit, as you know,
[00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:22.440]   but Senator Lindsey Graham, your colleague,
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:25.440]   he wants an authorization for the use of military force
[00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:27.120]   in case the talks fail.
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:30.040]   Do you think President Trump has taken the military option
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:32.720]   off the table, and would you vote for such an authorization
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:33.560]   for the use of military force? - That was the night
[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:35.400]   before the summit that Graham said that.
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:36.560]   - Absolutely not.
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:39.040]   Lindsey Graham is a danger to the country
[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:42.520]   by even proposing ideas like authorizing war with Korea.
[00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:43.880]   My goodness.
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:47.000]   So that should be something that is seen as naive
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.840]   and seen as something that really serious people
[00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:51.560]   shouldn't even really be discussing.
[00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:53.520]   - You're calling a fellow Republican senator
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:55.120]   a danger to the country?
[00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:56.520]   I want you to elaborate.
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:59.120]   - Well, if you've watched over time,
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:00.800]   I think what you've seen from Lindsey Graham
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:03.640]   is basically a naive worldview
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:06.240]   where he believes that war is always the answer,
[00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:09.120]   and that also means that expenditures for war
[00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:11.760]   are always the answer, and so I think that's bankrupting us
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:14.120]   as a country, but it's also gotten us involved
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:17.280]   in dozens and dozens of war where it's not really clear
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:19.600]   what the American interest is in those wars,
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:22.120]   and I think sometimes the reaction to our involvement
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:23.880]   in those wars has actually been worse
[00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:25.800]   than had we not been involved at all.
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:28.720]   - There's Rand Paul, a good man, a purist,
[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:30.240]   and I think that's what keeps him out
[00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:34.720]   of any serious presidential election campaign,
[00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:36.960]   but I think he's right.
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:38.800]   I think he's right about what he said about Lindsey Graham.
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:42.480]   I think he was right in his response to John Bolton,
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:45.760]   and again, you just wonder, Roger, though,
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:48.920]   when looking at this and saying, where are the Democrats?
[00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:51.720]   Where are the Democrats pushing back against Lindsey Graham?
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:53.560]   You don't even get to hear the mouthpiece
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:55.520]   from a Democrat party saying, wow, Lindsey Graham,
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:56.440]   why would you say that?
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:58.120]   - Does anyone in their right mind really think
[00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:00.040]   Donald Trump is gonna let down his guard
[00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:01.640]   in the middle of these negotiations?
[00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:03.120]   There's zero chance.
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:06.400]   I have to admit, I have really come to admire Rand Paul
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:08.600]   as a man of principle.
[00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:12.200]   If I had to match my politics with any member of the US Senate
[00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:16.280]   I think my politics most closely mirror his.
[00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:20.600]   He's a conservative with a libertarian tinge,
[00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:23.960]   deeply suspicious of the deep state
[00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:25.760]   and the deep state's war machine.
[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:29.160]   I think I agree with everything he just said.
[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:32.840]   - And again, I wish, and you know how this goes, Roger.
[00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:35.640]   I mean, it's really hard for a purist like Rand Paul
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:39.080]   to get through in a presidential election
[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:41.560]   when being a purist, unfortunately,
[00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:43.800]   separates so many people from your campaign
[00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:45.040]   that they don't end up voting for you.
[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:48.080]   But perhaps, like you said, politically,
[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:50.320]   this is probably the guy who matches up
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:51.800]   with our political leanings the most,
[00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:52.920]   but for this last election,
[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:55.800]   we needed a wrecking ball and that was President Trump
[00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:58.520]   and he's, for the most part, delivered so far.
[00:40:58.520 --> 00:40:59.920]   Before we go to the next break
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:01.520]   and we're gonna be joined by Alex Jones,
[00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:03.120]   I believe, in the next segment,
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:07.480]   look at this story out of the DFW CBS Local.
[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:11.400]   Brain-eating amoeba found in Louisiana water system.
[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:13.760]   A potentially deadly brain-eating amoeba
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:16.920]   has been found again in Louisiana.
[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:19.440]   Independent testing returned positive results
[00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:24.440]   for nalleria folari, sorry, I'm totally butchering that,
[00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:28.880]   which causes fatal brain swelling and tissue destruction.
[00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:33.080]   And so they found this in the Louisiana water system.
[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:37.800]   The third time since 2015, this potentially deadly organism
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:40.800]   has been found in the state's water system.
[00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:45.800]   And this is why we sell water filters.
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:49.920]   And it's amazing that people don't understand this.
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:51.960]   And they say, look at InfoWars
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:54.280]   telling you there's chemicals in the water.
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:57.280]   Look at InfoWars reporting on the potential bacteria
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:58.720]   in the water.
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:00.840]   Okay, well, that's just a fact.
[00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:02.440]   We don't make that up.
[00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:03.640]   And then guess what?
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:05.700]   We want filtered water too.
[00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:09.080]   So when you see a story like this,
[00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:12.440]   brain-eating amoeba found in Louisiana water system,
[00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:15.360]   your first reaction, if you haven't done it already,
[00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:18.640]   is to go to InfoWarsStore.com and order a water filter.

[00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:38.000]   everything that's in that water,
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.440]   not just the stuff that they add intentionally
[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:42.760]   like the fluorosilicic acid,
[00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:44.960]   but the runoff from the big pharmaceutical companies,
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:47.680]   the brain-eating amoebas, the lead.
[00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:49.240]   Filter your water, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:14.440]   I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet,
[00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:16.800]   it was just blue text on a white screen,
[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:19.840]   and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet,
[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:21.160]   and I thought it was pretty cool,
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:23.680]   and read all the books, and seen all the DVDs,
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:24.960]   and followed all your guests,
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:26.320]   and I've been using your products
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:28.680]   since the first iteration of Survival Shield,
[00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:30.560]   and since then, I'm on the X2,
[00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:33.080]   the Super Male Vitality, the Caveman,
[00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:36.720]   the Real Red Pill, Micro ZX, Body, it's all amazing.
[00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:37.560]   - Thank you, brother.
[00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:40.480]   - Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much,
[00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:42.960]   it's like you're just detoxing the mind,
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:45.840]   you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit,
[00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:49.080]   and it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God,
[00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:50.640]   but the more you chase God,
[00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:52.400]   and I wanted to say that it's an honor
[00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:54.720]   to stand side-by-side with you, the crew,
[00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:57.800]   and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.

[00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:18.680]   and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:20.720]   It is well-known in traditional medicine
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:22.880]   for its soothing properties.

[00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:39.000]   only contains one to 5% of active ingredients,
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.600]   but our turmeric root extract contains over 95%
[00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:44.080]   of the active ingredients.
[00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:46.760]   BOD-EASE combines turmeric with organic herbs

[00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:06.440]   You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:14.200]   (dramatic music)
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:22.840]   Live from the InfoWars.com studios,
[00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:25.920]   you're listening to The Alex Jones Show,
[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:29.320]   and now your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:34.920]   - Roger and I are talking here during the break.
[00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:37.880]   There's a Tucker Carlson clip, we may go to this,
[00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:41.320]   saying if you don't like the direction of the country,
[00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:42.520]   in fact, let's just roll to this now.
[00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:45.680]   Let's go to this Tucker Carlson clip, clip eight,
[00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:48.240]   from last night, talking about people complaining
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:50.840]   about the direction of the country.
[00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:52.240]   - Well, have more children.
[00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:54.840]   I mean, I grew up in a world where it was considered
[00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:56.640]   embarrassing to have more than two children.
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:59.680]   I don't think that's the case now among middle class,
[00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:02.040]   upper middle class people, but it was.
[00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:04.240]   And having kids is like, first of all,
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:06.080]   it's the most rewarding, greatest,
[00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:08.480]   most fun thing you can do.
[00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:09.960]   But it's also the most profound thing.
[00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:11.520]   Even if you don't like the direction of the country,
[00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:15.960]   have children, raise them the way that you want,
[00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:17.920]   consistent with your beliefs.
[00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:21.360]   I mean, it seems like all the answers are basic,
[00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:24.080]   nature-based answers, in my opinion, to everything.
[00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:25.600]   And that's the most basic of all,
[00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:28.080]   have more kids, raise decent children.
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:31.320]   - Tucker, don't give them any ideas.
[00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:34.200]   These people are already indoctrinating our children.
[00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:36.880]   We don't need them bringing up brainwashed minions
[00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:39.160]   intentionally into this world, Tucker.
[00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:41.600]   I understand where Tucker's coming from here,
[00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:43.560]   but let's not give these people any ideas.
[00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:47.440]   These are the most hateful, brainwashed radicals here
[00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:49.360]   that hate their own prosperity.
[00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:52.240]   I don't think we need them to procreate here, Roger.
[00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:54.520]   - You know, this is why Tucker Carlson's ratings
[00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:57.640]   are really soaring on Fox, 'cause he is a truth teller.
[00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:01.560]   I know Tucker's son, Buckley, a fine young man.
[00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:04.440]   I'm honored that he wrote the introduction
[00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:06.480]   for my book, "Stone Rules," which you can get
[00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:10.440]   at the Infowars.com store now at a special price.
[00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:14.040]   And I think he's exactly right.
[00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:17.920]   What we're finding is, even as you pointed out,
[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:21.960]   Susan Rice's offspring is a conservative.
[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:25.240]   We should not assume that children being brought
[00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:27.760]   into the world will grow up like their parents.
[00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:29.560]   It's not necessarily true.
[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:31.360]   - Interesting, an interesting point
[00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:32.760]   that you just posed there, yeah,
[00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:34.880]   because you wouldn't have thought it,
[00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:37.880]   but yeah, Susan Rice's son is apparently
[00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:41.040]   a big-time conservative, Stanford University graduate,
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:44.080]   unlike his mother.
[00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:47.720]   But I wonder if they understand
[00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:49.720]   what Tucker is even talking about there.
[00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:52.800]   'Cause I feel like the average liberal
[00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:55.200]   that complains about the direction the country is going
[00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:57.240]   wants the state to raise the child.
[00:49:57.240 --> 00:49:58.880]   And so they still won't even understand,
[00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:00.120]   like he's saying, like, have children.
[00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:02.520]   What he's saying is, you know, put forth the effort
[00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:05.000]   to raise children the right way
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.080]   to create the world that you wanna see.
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:08.880]   I'm not even sure if they'll understand that message.
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:10.960]   - No, what he's saying is inculcate in your children
[00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:12.800]   the values that you think are important
[00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:15.840]   so they can continue the fight for a free country.
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:17.640]   I think that's what he's saying.
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:21.360]   - What is this bar graph you guys have pulled up here?
[00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:23.760]   Mean of number of children think of self
[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:25.760]   as liberal or conservative.
[00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:29.040]   So you're saying this is how old,
[00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:30.800]   I'm trying to figure this out here,
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:34.440]   the nature of this bar graph that they're showing.
[00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:38.440]   Oh, okay, so conservatives just have more children.
[00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:39.960]   Well, that doesn't surprise me at all.
[00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:40.800]   I'm not surprised by that.
[00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:43.680]   - And that's a good, that portends good things
[00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:44.520]   for the future.
[00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:45.360]   - Yes, indeed.
[00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:46.400]   - Think of all those votes.
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:49.280]   - Because, (laughs)
[00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:52.360]   see, that's how a conservative thinks about getting votes,
[00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:53.760]   is having children.
[00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:56.040]   A liberal thinks about getting votes by opening the border
[00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:57.440]   and by having criminals vote.
[00:50:57.440 --> 00:51:00.520]   - I follow Maggie Haberman in the New York Time
[00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:04.040]   on her Instagram feed, and she's got adorable children.
[00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:05.720]   And I always put a comment saying,
[00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:09.000]   "Future young Republicans, drives her crazy."
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:10.960]   - Oh, I'm sure it does.
[00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:12.480]   But that's the thing is, again,
[00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:15.480]   people that listen to Tucker's show
[00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:16.680]   understand what he's saying,
[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:17.920]   and that's that you have kids,
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:19.520]   you raise them to be conservative,
[00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:22.920]   not if you have kids, you have the state raise them
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:24.720]   to be liberals, or beyond that,
[00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:27.120]   you have the state raise them to be dependent.
[00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:28.400]   That's what it really is.
[00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:30.880]   The Democrats want you dependent on the welfare,
[00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:32.560]   dependent on the food stamps,
[00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:36.200]   dependent on them to deliver it to you,
[00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:38.400]   as opposed to a conservative message,
[00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:41.240]   which is, no, you need to be independent
[00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:43.560]   so that you can provide that for yourself,
[00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:45.000]   so that you can provide that for your family.
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:46.280]   You were actually saying, too,
[00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:49.000]   that you believe you're seeing some polls now
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.760]   that are indicating that African American youth
[00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:54.880]   are the approval for Trump amongst that,
[00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:57.320]   or the support for Trump amongst that demographic is soaring.
[00:51:57.320 --> 00:51:59.320]   You think that has to do with the Dennis Rodman,
[00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:00.160]   the Kanye West?
[00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:02.960]   - Particularly among young African males.
[00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:04.720]   Now, will they vote?
[00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:05.560]   Are they voters?
[00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:06.720]   That's an interesting question,
[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:08.840]   but there's clearly a shift going on.
[00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:12.000]   That's why the ferocious attack on Kanye.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:15.160]   That's why the ferocious attack on Dennis Rodman.
[00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:19.320]   People are coming off the plantation,
[00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:24.320]   and the Democratic left establishment
[00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:26.520]   doesn't like free thinking.
[00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:27.480]   They don't like the idea
[00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:30.000]   that these people can think for themselves.
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:33.400]   - And what does that typically result in?
[00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:35.040]   They leave the Democrat party.
[00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:39.280]   Now, you've got the senator from Tennessee,
[00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:41.320]   Bob Corker, running around.
[00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:43.960]   This is the same guy that got booed
[00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:46.680]   at Trump's rally in Tennessee.
[00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:50.680]   Bob Corker introduced Trump, got booed.
[00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:53.760]   Or no, no, no, I think it was actually Trump that maybe,
[00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:55.920]   I don't remember if Trump mentioned Bob Corker's name
[00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:56.880]   and they booed him,
[00:52:56.880 --> 00:53:00.000]   or if Corker came up to introduce Trump and they booed him.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:01.800]   Either way, they booed Corker.
[00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:06.360]   It's comments like this from Bob Corker on CNN,
[00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:09.920]   which is why he gets booed by his own state.
[00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:12.660]   - You got a bunch of great-haired old guys
[00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:16.800]   that had their cult that controlled Washington for decades.
[00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:18.480]   Bob Corker was one of those.
[00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:20.840]   And people started realizing that Bob Corker was a fraud.
[00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:22.520]   He wasn't a real conservative.
[00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:23.360]   He wasn't doing what he promised.
[00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:25.440]   - So this is actually Ben Ferguson saying,
[00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:26.880]   "You know what, pull this down.
[00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:28.120]   "I misunderstood the clip here.
[00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:28.960]   "This is my mistake.
[00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:31.280]   "I misunderstood the clip, but here's the thing.
[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:34.580]   "This narrative is actually going around
[00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:36.780]   "that Trump voters are in a cult."
[00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:40.040]   I bet you could plug that into SEO right now,
[00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:41.960]   and you'll see that there's multiple people saying
[00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:44.640]   that Trump supporters are in a cult.
[00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:47.120]   They're the, this is amazing, Roger.
[00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:49.080]   Everything they say about us, it's them.
[00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:50.680]   They're the ones that colluded with Russia.
[00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:52.060]   They're the ones that are racist.
[00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:53.680]   They're the ones that are in a cult.
[00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:56.640]   - Well, in this case, there are certain established
[00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:59.440]   Republicans who don't understand that Trumpism
[00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:01.640]   is larger than the Republican Party.
[00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:04.320]   And in every one of their states, believe me,
[00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:06.840]   Donald Trump is more popular in Tennessee
[00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:09.680]   than Robert Corker is in Tennessee.
[00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:12.120]   And this is also true with Ben Sasse
[00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:14.600]   in Nebraska, for example.
[00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:18.800]   So every Republican president has remade the party
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:23.160]   in their own image, Lincoln, Eisenhower, Reagan, and so on.
[00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:25.080]   And so it is true with Trump.
[00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:27.240]   So what Corker is really complaining about
[00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:30.820]   is the fact that Trump is more popular than he is,
[00:54:30.820 --> 00:54:35.820]   and that his, and then that his establishment colleagues are.
[00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:37.440]   - So the crew just found it.
[00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:39.360]   It was Trump who mentioned Bob Corker.
[00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:40.600]   They all booed.
[00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:42.400]   And Bob Corker did say the GOP
[00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:44.120]   is becoming cult-like under Trump.
[00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:46.920]   You know, Roger, here's what I think one of the problems is,
[00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:50.240]   or one of the, it's like, there's such a disdain
[00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:52.600]   and hatred for the Republican Party,
[00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:57.360]   not just amongst the left and Democrats, which, okay,
[00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:59.480]   but there's also a disdain for the Republican Party
[00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:01.280]   amongst many centrists.
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:04.920]   And I think it's because they see the R behind Trump's name,
[00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:08.360]   they have this distaste for Donald Trump,
[00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:09.840]   but they don't understand,
[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:12.840]   he ran under the Republican Party
[00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:15.360]   because he understood that was the track
[00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:16.840]   to get into the White House.
[00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:18.400]   He didn't run as a Republican
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:20.520]   because he's a member of the Republican Party.
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:22.360]   He ran as a Republican because he saw
[00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:24.960]   that that's where the dominoes were aligned to fall
[00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:26.760]   by getting the Republican nomination
[00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:28.040]   and winning as a Republican.
[00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:30.000]   - He correctly figured out in 2000
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.160]   when I was trying to convince him to run for president
[00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:33.840]   as the Reform Party candidate
[00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:35.440]   that you could only get elected president
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:38.520]   as one of the nominees of the two major parties.
[00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:40.840]   Secondarily, though, if you look at the results
[00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:43.640]   of the election in Wisconsin, in Michigan,
[00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:46.360]   in Pennsylvania, and Ohio,
[00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:50.120]   you will see that he was able to outperform Mitt Romney
[00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:52.280]   and John McCain before him
[00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:54.000]   because he's had this ability to reach
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.640]   beyond the Republican Party.
[00:55:56.640 --> 00:55:58.920]   That's building a new coalition.
[00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:01.880]   And if he continues on the current track
[00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:05.560]   of economic prosperity and peace abroad,
[00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:07.800]   you're gonna have whole new realignment,
[00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:09.960]   a whole new coalition.
[00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:13.160]   Choosing the Second Amendment issue
[00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:15.360]   as a centerpiece for 2018
[00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:17.800]   is one of the biggest mistakes the Democrats can make
[00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:21.760]   because it gets us beyond country club Republicans.
[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:25.220]   Many Second Amendment supporters are not Republicans.
[00:56:25.220 --> 00:56:26.360]   They're Democrats.
[00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:28.640]   They're blue collar, working class Democrats
[00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:32.360]   or independents who will vote with us on that key issue.
[00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:35.760]   - Well, don't you feel like that is just a path
[00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:36.920]   that they've chosen to go down
[00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:38.720]   because they're starting to realize here
[00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:42.360]   as the midterms approach that the hate Trump message,
[00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:45.160]   the hate Trump campaign is not going to lead to victory.
[00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:48.240]   So they're falling back on the next best thing for them,
[00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:50.640]   which is to attack the Second Amendment and demonize guns.
[00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:52.320]   Don't you think that might have something to do with this?
[00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:54.360]   - Well, look, I think they wanna take away our guns
[00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:55.640]   because what they really wanna do
[00:56:55.640 --> 00:56:57.440]   is take away our First Amendment rights.
[00:56:57.440 --> 00:57:00.320]   What they really wanna do is kneecap us on the internet,
[00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:03.860]   censor us, take us off YouTube, take us off Facebook.
[00:57:03.860 --> 00:57:06.640]   This is the war that's being waged on InfoWars
[00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:08.120]   even as we speak.
[00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:09.640]   And they know it'll be a lot easier
[00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:13.180]   if they can remove people's Second Amendment rights.

[00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:50.240]   We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:55.880]   - You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:55.880 --> 01:00:01.680]   (cash register ringing)
[01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:04.560]   (dramatic music)
[01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:07.840]   - And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war
[01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:10.240]   and say, I don't know what's gonna happen at the end of this
[01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:14.080]   but you wanna fight, you better believe you got one.
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:15.800]   (crowd cheering)
[01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:19.360]   - From the front lines of the information war,
[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:21.000]   it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.760]   (dramatic music)
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:41.640]   - As if the severity at the Singapore Capella Hotel
[01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:44.280]   wasn't racked with enough cosmic intensity
[01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:45.800]   before the meeting took place
[01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:48.040]   between the Rocket Man and the old dottard
[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:50.320]   as they previously described each other
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:52.480]   reeling from Canadian Prime Minister,
[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:54.480]   Justin Trudeau's backstabbery
[01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:57.720]   and outraged Trump administration economic advisor,
[01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:01.640]   Larry Kudlow was rushed to the Walter Reed Medical Center
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:03.400]   suffering from a heart attack.
[01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:05.960]   This was no ragamuffin affair.
[01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:08.360]   After the two leaders comfortably arrived
[01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:10.920]   at the Capella Singapore Hotel grounds,
[01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:14.240]   Kim Jong-un settled into one of the finest hotel rooms
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:17.760]   on earth surrounded by fields of roaming peacocks,
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:21.240]   an amusement park and complete with a personal bathroom
[01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:23.800]   for Kim Jong-un as requested.
[01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:27.600]   And oddly enough, no other American quantified the absence
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:29.320]   of any previous leadership
[01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:32.200]   to tackle the North Korean hermit nuclear kingdom
[01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:33.600]   like Dennis Rodman.
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:36.400]   - And Obama didn't even give me the time of day.
[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:40.280]   I asked him, I said, I have something to say from North Korea
[01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:43.840]   he just brushed me off, but that didn't deter me.
[01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:45.960]   I still kept going back, I kept going back,
[01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:47.280]   I kept going back.
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:50.440]   I showed my loyalty and my trustworthiness to this country.
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:53.960]   And I said to everybody, I said, the door will open.
[01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:57.800]   When I said those damn things, when I went back home,
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:00.000]   I got so many belt threads.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.840]   I knew it, I was the only one,
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:03.400]   I never had no one to hear me,
[01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:05.600]   I didn't know no one had to see me.
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:07.720]   But I took those bullets, I took all that,
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:10.400]   I took everything, everyone came at me
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:11.800]   and I'm still standing.
[01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:13.800]   And today is a great day for everybody,
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:17.800]   Singapore, Tokyo, China, everything, it's a great day.
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:19.880]   - No less bringing an end to the table,
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:22.040]   the atrocity known as the Korean War
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:24.840]   that began on June 25th, 1950,
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:28.320]   just about a fortnight shy of 68 years ago,
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:31.680]   along with an effort toward denuclearization
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:33.800]   in exchange for security.
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:36.640]   - North Korea has previously confirmed to us
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:38.640]   its willingness to denuclearize.
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:42.120]   And we're eager to see if those words prove sincere.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.240]   - The fact that our two leaders are sitting down
[01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:47.480]   face to face is a sign of the enormous potential
[01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:50.240]   to accomplish something that will immensely benefit
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:52.520]   both of our peoples and the entire world.
[01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:55.360]   - I want to thank Chairman Kim for taking
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:58.120]   the first bold step toward a bright new future
[01:02:58.120 --> 01:02:59.040]   for his people.
[01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:01.560]   Our unprecedented meeting,
[01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:03.800]   the first between an American president
[01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:07.360]   and a leader of North Korea
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:11.160]   proves that real change is indeed possible.
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:14.920]   - My meeting with Chairman Kim was honest,
[01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:17.240]   direct, and productive.
[01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:18.600]   We got to know each other well
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:21.120]   in a very confined period of time,
[01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:25.440]   under very strong, strong circumstance.
[01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:27.200]   - While the crumbling fake news media
[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:29.200]   attempted to write off the entire affair,
[01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:31.520]   CNN's Jim Acosta even yelled,
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:35.120]   "Are you going to give up your nukes during the photo op?"
[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:37.320]   - We're very proud of what took place today.
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:41.680]   I think our whole relationship with North Korea
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:44.600]   and the Korean Peninsula is going to be
[01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:49.360]   a very much different situation than it has in the past.
[01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:50.840]   We both want to do something,
[01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:53.040]   we both are going to do something,
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:56.040]   and we have developed a very special bond.
[01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:58.760]   So people are going to be very impressed,
[01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:00.520]   people are going to be very happy,
[01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:02.960]   and we're going to take care of a very big
[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:04.960]   and very dangerous problem for the world.
[01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:07.360]   And I want to thank Chairman Kim.
[01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:09.800]   We spent a lot of time together today,
[01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:11.720]   a very intensive time,
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:13.960]   and I would actually say that it worked out
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:17.360]   for both of us far better than anybody could have expected.
[01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:20.400]   - Get ready for the big payback, fake liberals.
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:23.800]   This is what American leadership looks like.
[01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:27.240]   John Bowne reporting for Infowars.com.
[01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:31.440]   - Ladies and gentlemen, Scott Adams.
[01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:35.400]   Well, he's been talking about word for word.
[01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:38.960]   Got put into the amazing little short video
[01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:41.760]   that President Trump showed Kim Jong-un,
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:44.760]   the power of positive thinking history not repeating itself
[01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:47.280]   if we get involved and become history's actors
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:49.480]   to steal a phrase from Karl Rove.
[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:50.720]   What was he talking about?
[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:53.640]   He's saying we know that secret, you don't.
[01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:55.240]   So you repeat it, but we don't.
[01:04:55.240 --> 01:05:01.920]   Infowarslife and infowarslife.com is extremely excited
[01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:03.840]   to announce our latest release,

[01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:10.160]   Winner's Son is a premium quality
[01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:12.400]   vitamin D3 nutritional supplement.
[01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:14.120]   It is produced by extracting oil
[01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:17.120]   from healthy nutrient-dense plants known as lichens.

[01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:35.800]   but the result, as verified by independent laboratories,

[01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:45.560]   - Well, I appreciate Scott Adams coming on on short notice,
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:49.560]   creator of Dilbert, you name it.
[01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:52.440]   Really, Life Coach is what he segued into
[01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:55.600]   and very, very popular online doing that.
[01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:56.800]   And of course, he's been at the center
[01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:59.680]   of the whole Kanye West awakening process
[01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:00.720]   and made the point a few months ago
[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:04.360]   that Kanye had blown a hole in reality.
[01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:06.940]   So I guess that reality could then start pouring in.
[01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:09.600]   He talked about how it's a lie that history repeats.
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:13.880]   It's something politicians, people use against us.
[01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:17.000]   It doesn't have to repeat if we don't want it to.
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.880]   And now I was watching the little two minute video
[01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:24.680]   that Trump showed Kim Jong-un
[01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:27.640]   that as Scott Adams pointed out a few days ago,
[01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:32.520]   oh, and could be the best negotiation strategy ever.
[01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:35.720]   And it certainly knew and it certainly worked so far,
[01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:36.560]   but I'm watching, I'm like,
[01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:38.500]   oh, that's Scott Adams word for word.
[01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:40.960]   This is what he said in his last video about Kanye.
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:42.520]   Somebody must be watching.
[01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:44.760]   And then sure enough, Scott Adams put a video out
[01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:47.320]   pointing out, not taking credit for it,
[01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:50.760]   but pointing out those parallels.
[01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:53.320]   And so I'm just wondering with Scott Adams,
[01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:56.240]   obviously he and Trump are going to the same fount
[01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:57.080]   of knowledge.
[01:07:57.080 --> 01:07:59.160]   And I know there was this pastor that was real famous
[01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:01.960]   that was a positive thinker, positive speaker,
[01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:03.960]   that that helped motivate Trump to a great extent.
[01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:07.280]   But just the positivity coming back in the world
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:09.720]   is even making me a lot happier of a person
[01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:11.440]   because I tend to get negative sometimes too
[01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:12.640]   about the bad things in the world
[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:14.580]   instead of getting positive about the good things.
[01:08:14.580 --> 01:08:17.720]   But then I start seeing all these great things happening.
[01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:19.120]   But while I was on vacation,
[01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:22.200]   I ran into Democrats who get in my face, three of them did.
[01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:23.520]   And I'd say, what about the peace deal?
[01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:24.360]   Isn't it great?
[01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:25.180]   What about the economy?
[01:08:25.180 --> 01:08:27.080]   And they just say, shut up racist.
[01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:29.960]   And I said, that's not reality and that's not true.
[01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:33.800]   And so it just gets crazier and crazier and crazier
[01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:36.480]   that we have big polls out on infowars.com,
[01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:38.320]   Paul Joseph Watson article, TV poll,
[01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:42.600]   71% of liberals don't want peace with North Korea
[01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:44.240]   because Trump would take credit.
[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:46.840]   They're having national TV polls
[01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:49.000]   with Michelle Wolf's Netflix show
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.320]   and 71% don't want peace and admit
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:52.840]   it's because they don't like Trump.
[01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:57.840]   This is like a death cult of negative people
[01:08:57.840 --> 01:08:59.560]   that would rather die in nuclear war.
[01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:02.840]   Scott Adams, you're really good at putting your finger
[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:05.620]   on the major pulse of the good things and the bad things.
[01:09:05.620 --> 01:09:09.320]   But if Kanye blew a hole in reality, which I agree,
[01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:12.720]   and now that breach has turned into a huge gaping maw,
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:14.360]   where are we historically right now?
[01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:16.520]   And thanks for joining us.
[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:19.520]   - Well, I call it the beginning of the golden age.
[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:22.120]   I've been defining the golden age as that moment
[01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:26.800]   when people start realizing that the remaining big problems
[01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:28.160]   are no longer physical.
[01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:31.220]   The physical problem would be you run out of food,
[01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:35.080]   out of resources, and we're not in that situation.
[01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:36.400]   We're more in a situation where,
[01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:38.400]   North Korea is a perfect example.
[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:40.680]   We were worried about what they were thinking
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:42.960]   and they were worried about what we were thinking,
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:45.560]   but neither of us had any reason to be at war
[01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:49.360]   or to start a war or to continue bad feelings.
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:54.360]   So by both Chairman Kim, who said it first, by the way,
[01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:58.000]   he said in his first statement at the summit,
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.040]   he said words to the effect of,
[01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:02.200]   let's leave the past behind.
[01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:05.280]   And then you saw President Trump with his video,
[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:07.320]   that's getting a lot of attention,
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:09.460]   saying exactly the same thing.
[01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:12.720]   Because if you dwell on the past, you're stuck with,
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:16.720]   but we can't move forward because you did this that one time
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:19.480]   or some relative of yours did something one time
[01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:22.080]   or our side did something that one time.
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:24.000]   You just can't move forward.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.600]   And it seems to me that the biggest story here
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:30.000]   that isn't reported because people don't like
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.360]   to frame anything positively for President Trump,
[01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:36.000]   when they say, "Hey, he walked away from that summit
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.260]   "with nothing."
[01:10:37.260 --> 01:10:39.080]   And I say, it's easy to argue,
[01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:41.340]   well, he got a commitment to do this
[01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:43.080]   or a commitment to do that.
[01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:45.520]   But realistically, all the commitments they made,
[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:48.800]   the commitments we made are reasonably reversible.
[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:50.700]   So it's not really about that.
[01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:53.360]   What the president did and Chairman Kim,
[01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:55.240]   and I give him credit as well,
[01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:57.800]   is that they have redefined the situation
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:00.240]   from two moral enemies, one who must win
[01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:01.900]   and the other one must lose,
[01:11:01.900 --> 01:11:06.900]   to two potential friends who have taken the first few steps
[01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:09.800]   that are not really representative of the whole journey,
[01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:12.700]   but they're on the right path to friendship.
[01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:14.860]   Something where we win, they win.
[01:11:14.860 --> 01:11:17.600]   And frankly, they win a lot bigger than we win
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:19.560]   if this plays out right.
[01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:23.480]   So the whole reframing from enemies
[01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:27.080]   to probably friends who can help each other
[01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:29.560]   is what the president walked away with.
[01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:31.420]   And it's completely ignored.
[01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:36.420]   And when he's given that we're essentially safer
[01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:39.020]   from nuclear war now, and his critics said,
[01:11:39.020 --> 01:11:41.000]   "What, that's crazy."
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:45.340]   And I say, "Who has a nuclear war with their ally?
[01:11:45.340 --> 01:11:48.000]   "Who bombs somebody who has just offered
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.840]   "to help rebuild your country?
[01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:53.540]   "Who becomes an enemy with somebody
[01:11:53.540 --> 01:11:57.000]   "who's got their hand out literally and figuratively?"
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.480]   It's the sort of thing that just doesn't really happen.
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:02.140]   So he reframed the situation in a way
[01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:07.140]   that effectively made a nuclear war no longer have a purpose.
[01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:08.860]   Who bombs their friends?
[01:12:08.860 --> 01:12:10.220]   It just doesn't happen.
[01:12:10.220 --> 01:12:12.100]   And as long as we're on that path,
[01:12:12.100 --> 01:12:15.700]   even tentatively, even perhaps,
[01:12:15.700 --> 01:12:17.420]   and everybody would agree that much more
[01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:19.480]   would need to be done to make it real.
[01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:23.860]   But as long as you're on the path to mutual benefit,
[01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:25.580]   nobody fights, nobody.
[01:12:25.580 --> 01:12:26.740]   It just doesn't happen.
[01:12:26.740 --> 01:12:30.560]   And that I think is the biggest unreported story.
[01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:35.020]   - Scott, I went back a few days ago
[01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:38.440]   and I watched your 20-minute viral video
[01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:41.180]   for however long it was on Kanye blowing a hole in reality.
[01:12:41.180 --> 01:12:43.340]   And then I went back and watched your new video.
[01:12:43.340 --> 01:12:44.300]   But before I watched that one,
[01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:45.860]   I wanted to go watch the old one.
[01:12:45.860 --> 01:12:48.180]   And I don't want to say Trump's plagiarizing, and he's not,
[01:12:48.180 --> 01:12:52.420]   but it's word for word about unlimited resources,
[01:12:52.420 --> 01:12:55.860]   we've transcended resources, we can flip the script,
[01:12:55.860 --> 01:12:58.100]   we can take control of our destiny.
[01:12:58.100 --> 01:12:59.340]   History doesn't have to repeat,
[01:12:59.340 --> 01:13:01.860]   but we're the people in the critical time to do it.
[01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:06.220]   I mean, seeing that, I mean, you guys are on the same page.
[01:13:06.220 --> 01:13:08.300]   So maybe for listeners that want to learn more
[01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:11.360]   about the antecedents to your political
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:14.240]   and your philosophy in life,
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:15.900]   what would they want to research?
[01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:22.320]   - Well, my book, "Win Bigly" has a good introduction
[01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:23.320]   to that sort of stuff.
[01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:25.640]   But as you mentioned before,
[01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:30.520]   the influential pastor Norman Vincent Peale
[01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:34.360]   was the person who really was the father, if you will,
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:37.200]   of the idea of the power of positive thinking.
[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:38.540]   That was his bestselling book.
[01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:42.060]   And he was Trump's pastor when Trump was a kid.
[01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:44.240]   And he was influential to me as well.
[01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:45.580]   I read his books.
[01:13:45.580 --> 01:13:49.820]   So I think we all got a little bit infected
[01:13:49.820 --> 01:13:53.640]   by the strategy of being positive
[01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:56.460]   and framing things in the positive way
[01:13:56.460 --> 01:13:58.740]   for win-win situations.
[01:13:58.740 --> 01:14:01.360]   So it probably shouldn't be a big surprise
[01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:03.660]   that people who had the same influences
[01:14:03.660 --> 01:14:05.780]   have arrived at the same way of--
[01:14:05.780 --> 01:14:07.560]   - Sure, but a couple years ago
[01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:09.360]   when you did the whole mental judo
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:10.720]   where you said, "Oh, I'm supporting Hillary,"
[01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:12.680]   or I'll be basically murdered,
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:15.200]   you were saying, "I believe Trump is following this.
[01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:16.680]   "I believe he'll be successful."
[01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:19.160]   And I think it's because you understood his mindset
[01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:21.240]   that you have, better than anybody, I think,
[01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:22.480]   charted what he would do.
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:25.680]   - Yeah, and the other thing he does well
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:29.880]   that he doesn't get credit for is a sense of priorities.
[01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:32.400]   If you look at the criticisms of him,
[01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:36.300]   and you were to make a list of all the things people say,
[01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:38.700]   and then make a list of the things he's actually doing
[01:14:38.700 --> 01:14:42.060]   that are real things like the economy, North Korea,
[01:14:42.060 --> 01:14:44.980]   progress with beating ISIS, et cetera,
[01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:48.240]   those are all real things and are top priorities.
[01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:50.540]   The things people are arguing about are,
[01:14:50.540 --> 01:14:53.300]   well, he didn't pass the fact-checking on this
[01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:54.820]   according to us.
[01:14:54.820 --> 01:14:56.420]   It tends to be a little subject
[01:14:56.420 --> 01:14:58.620]   to what the facts are in many cases.
[01:14:58.620 --> 01:14:59.980]   - Exactly, they're still playing the game
[01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:02.500]   like they're God and they dictate reality.
[01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:07.960]   - Yeah, and the president has put winning
[01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:09.480]   and making America great again,
[01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:11.600]   having a strong economy, all those things,
[01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:14.760]   very expressly at the top of his priority list.
[01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:17.560]   And when he uses persuasion to get there,
[01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:20.600]   the critics are arguing the least important parts
[01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:21.840]   of what he said.
[01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:23.640]   They're arguing about the wording.
[01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:26.600]   They're arguing about the technical accuracy.
[01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:29.160]   They're arguing about whether in some way
[01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:31.960]   that we can't imagine things will be worse in the future
[01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:32.800]   because we allowed this to happen today.
[01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:34.880]   - But what matters is it's really working.
[01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:37.040]   So I wanna ask Scott Adams, a real visionary,
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:39.520]   what's coming next straight ahead?
[01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:40.880]   And I wanna talk about the negativity though.
[01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:42.920]   As people get more positive and we realize
[01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:44.600]   that humanity's in a pretty good position
[01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:46.000]   if we behave like it,
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.520]   well, what is the negative side gonna do?
[01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:48.600]   'Cause they don't seem to be getting better.
[01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:50.440]   They seem to be getting just insane
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:52.880]   and just making up their own false reality
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:54.200]   while putting their finger at us and saying,
[01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:56.080]   we're the ones lying, we'll be back.

[01:19:56.520 --> 01:20:04.720]   - You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:11.960]   (upbeat music)
[01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:16.400]   (audience cheering)
[01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:29.480]   Alex Jones here, Owen Schroer is riding shotgun.
[01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:31.520]   We've got one of the only Scott Adams,
[01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:32.680]   creator of Dilbert on with us.
[01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:34.400]   Winn Bigley is his new bestselling book
[01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:35.880]   that I read and was excellent.
[01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:39.720]   TV poll, 71% of liberals don't want peace with North Korea
[01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:41.560]   because Trump would take the credit.
[01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:44.040]   I'm gonna play a short clip of this, but I'm not kidding.
[01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:46.240]   I was on vacation for eight days, as you know,
[01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:47.800]   in Hawaii, a working vacation.
[01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:51.520]   I took all four of my children, my wife, we all went.
[01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:54.120]   And I had leftist three times come over and say,
[01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:56.120]   "How do you sleep at night, you racist?"
[01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:57.880]   And then make up something I never said
[01:20:57.880 --> 01:21:00.760]   that the media says I said, or some edited quote.
[01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:02.240]   And then I would try to humanize it and say,
[01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:04.320]   "Hey, listen, what about Trump and the economy coming back?
[01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:08.120]   "What about Trump freeing up a lot of these
[01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:10.320]   "experimental medical treatments, people that are terminal?"
[01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:12.400]   (mimics gunfire)
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:14.520]   Get away from me, I'm gonna call security.
[01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:17.160]   So they would talk to me, two of the three people
[01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:19.800]   would then threaten to call the police on me
[01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:21.120]   if I even spoke back to them.
[01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:22.800]   We're talking 20 seconds into conversation.
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:25.200]   I'd say, "Fine, I'm sorry, Trump's getting
[01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:26.040]   "the big peace deal."
[01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:28.000]   And they're like, "Oh, whatever."
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.400]   And now we have a poll, but that's what's crazy is
[01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:33.560]   what Scott Adams said is 1000% correct.
[01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:36.800]   We got, by putting pressure on them at first,
[01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:39.240]   got them to come across the DMZ,
[01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:41.640]   got them to meet with the South Korean president,
[01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:44.520]   unprecedented, got them to blow up their nuclear facilities,
[01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:47.920]   got them to basically unconditionally agree on a path
[01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:51.320]   to total denuclearization with a real deal to build them up
[01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:52.880]   so the military-industrial complex doesn't get
[01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:54.360]   the trillions the Koreans do.
[01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:55.880]   This is a good thing.
[01:21:55.880 --> 01:22:00.000]   And you've got major Nobel laureate groups
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.800]   and people that are on the panel over there
[01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:06.240]   now saying he is nominated and that he deserves praise.
[01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:07.360]   This is how we have peace.
[01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:08.440]   But the Democrats were the ones
[01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:11.240]   that always want peace and always want this great stuff.
[01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:12.840]   And oh, Republicans are all warmongers.
[01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:15.400]   Here comes Trump, who was against the first Iraq war,
[01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:16.480]   the second, all that stuff.
[01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:20.160]   Here he comes, proven right, and man, they are pissed.
[01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:22.640]   Well, ask Scott Adams how they're gonna respond,
[01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:24.520]   where this cognitive dissonance goes,
[01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:27.120]   how crazy it's gonna get before they finally admit
[01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:28.760]   they've been in a cult.
[01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:29.580]   Let's play the clip.
[01:22:29.580 --> 01:22:31.440]   Here it is from Netflix.
[01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:34.800]   - Are you sort of hoping we don't get peace with North Korea
[01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:36.640]   so you wouldn't have to give Trump credit?
[01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:37.480]   Yes or no?
[01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:41.900]   (bell dings)
[01:22:41.900 --> 01:22:44.720]   Yeah, I mean.
[01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:46.040]   - That's how liberal they are,
[01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:49.040]   that they would rather the world explodes.
[01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:51.680]   They're like, I told you guys he was an asshole.
[01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:53.400]   (audience laughs)
[01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:55.560]   - Yeah, I don't know if that's gonna happen
[01:22:55.560 --> 01:22:58.800]   when the bomb hits and then all those Trump people,
[01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:00.040]   they're not gonna be like,
[01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:03.000]   oh, we should have been okay with her email.
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.360]   (audience laughs)
[01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:07.560]   It doesn't even make sense anymore.
[01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:09.400]   That's the article on Infowars.com.
[01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:11.320]   That's Michelle Wolfe's Netflix show.
[01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:13.560]   Scott, what's gonna happen to these people
[01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:14.840]   as things just get better and better?
[01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:16.640]   You're gonna get sick of the winning and the winning
[01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:17.480]   and the winning, and you're gonna say,
[01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:18.300]   I'm tired of the winning.
[01:23:18.300 --> 01:23:20.920]   No, I'm sorry, we're gonna keep winning.
[01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:23.160]   - Yeah, if you have a moment,
[01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:27.680]   check out the Nate Silver tweet he just did,
[01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:31.320]   mentioning that people seem to be looking for reasons
[01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:35.100]   why Trump did poorly instead of looking for reasons
[01:23:35.100 --> 01:23:38.280]   why the agreement is probably making the risk
[01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:39.920]   of nuclear war less.
[01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:41.640]   That would be a fun one to look at.
[01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:45.320]   Now, I had predicted on election day,
[01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:48.520]   when Trump got elected, there would be this massive
[01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:51.720]   cluster bomb of cognitive dissonance, and we saw that.
[01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:54.200]   There were, I don't know, dozens and dozens of reasons
[01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:58.080]   given for why this unexpected outcome happened.
[01:23:58.080 --> 01:23:59.880]   And you saw people imagining they lived
[01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:01.840]   in a Hitler-like state.
[01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:04.960]   You saw people imagining all manner of things
[01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:08.040]   that were gonna go wrong, and of course, none of them did.
[01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:10.200]   Now some time has passed.
[01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:15.200]   Their opposition has hardened,
[01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:18.320]   and at the same time, we're going into this
[01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:21.520]   North Korean situation, which is the ultimate trigger
[01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:24.920]   for cognitive dissonance, because this is the very thing
[01:24:24.920 --> 01:24:28.200]   that everybody thought was just too hard,
[01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:29.680]   that nobody could do it.
[01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:31.920]   And he's sort of making it look easy,
[01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:35.040]   and it's on a path that something really good could happen.
[01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:38.480]   As I said, we've changed the frame from two enemies
[01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:41.360]   who really need to get serious about
[01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:45.840]   how you specifically go forward,
[01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:49.280]   to two potential friends that is a whole different situation.
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:52.280]   So I think that if this goes to the next level
[01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:54.120]   of where we're actually very comfortable
[01:24:54.120 --> 01:24:57.440]   that their nuclear weapons are controlled, identified,
[01:24:57.440 --> 01:24:59.640]   they're moving in the back of the country,
[01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:01.680]   that you're gonna see brains exploding,
[01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:05.360]   because their world won't make sense
[01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:06.960]   that this person that they believe
[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:10.640]   is just completely incompetent has done the thing
[01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:13.880]   that all the smart people couldn't do.
[01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:15.320]   And I mean this legitimately.
[01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:19.160]   I'm not saying this as interesting political punditry.
[01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:21.040]   I'm not just trying to be interesting.
[01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:26.040]   I believe legitimately there's a huge mental risk here
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:30.600]   that could happen if North Korea goes in the right direction
[01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:32.440]   and it looks like it is.
[01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:33.280]   - I totally agree.
[01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:35.320]   The economy coming back, all the other positive things
[01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:36.640]   would take up the time we have.
[01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:37.560]   I went through the positive things,
[01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:40.200]   but it's because I think you quantified it.
[01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:43.320]   This is a non-zero sum game
[01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:45.360]   now that we have this much technology.
[01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:47.120]   And a lot of the globalists admit that, know that.
[01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:48.960]   They don't want people to get to that point
[01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:50.280]   where they don't have control anymore,
[01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:51.680]   where the establishment doesn't,
[01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:53.200]   and where humanity really accelerates.
[01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:55.520]   I think we're reaching that acceleration point,
[01:25:55.520 --> 01:26:00.520]   but the crony capitalists, the monopoly powers,
[01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:05.120]   the interest that want chaos so they can control it
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:06.520]   and knock out their competition,
[01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:08.280]   they're doing everything they can to block it.
[01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:09.600]   And then here comes Trump
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:11.600]   who doesn't want to keep it a hermit state
[01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:13.480]   and doesn't want to keep the aircraft carriers there.
[01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:15.720]   And of course they were criticizing him for beefing things up
[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:17.880]   to put the pressure in the art of the deal.
[01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:20.600]   What are they going to do then?
[01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:23.040]   Is there any way, what would you say to them
[01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:25.360]   when they come up to me, Scott, you're a smart guy,
[01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:28.200]   and Owen Chai makes you ride the shotgun,
[01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:31.560]   when they come over and just say racist, I hate you,
[01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:33.880]   shame on you, it's like they're children.
[01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:35.400]   They're using peer pressure on me.
[01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:38.160]   I just see them as a mental patient making stuff up
[01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:39.800]   and trying to control reality,
[01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:40.960]   but I don't know what to say to them
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:42.000]   'cause they aren't listening.
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.840]   It's all one way, I don't exist.
[01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:47.360]   It's like I'm there for them to LARP.
[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:49.400]   It's like live action role-playing
[01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:51.640]   and they're playing Dungeons and Dragons
[01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:55.120]   and they've come upon some type of evil demon or something.
[01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:59.760]   - Yeah, in my experience, you can't talk somebody out
[01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:01.240]   of that kind of frame.
[01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:02.560]   So if somebody's locked in,
[01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:03.920]   there's nothing you're going to say,
[01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:07.800]   even if you said everything right and persuasive,
[01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:09.000]   they're pretty locked in.
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.920]   The only thing that's going to make a difference is results.
[01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:15.040]   So if, for example, the president makes some real progress
[01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:19.040]   with urban revitalization or prison reform,
[01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:23.320]   if he keeps doing some, what I would call very strategic,
[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:27.120]   but also humanitarian pardons,
[01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:30.400]   if he keeps doing that, the weight of evidence
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:33.440]   is just going to make it too hard to hold your frame.
[01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:37.520]   We already saw, somebody sent me by tweet,
[01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:42.040]   a comment, an individual had asked Noam Chomsky
[01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:44.280]   what he thought about the North Korea situation
[01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:47.800]   and Chomsky actually had a positive opinion on it,
[01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:50.360]   that it looked like it was a step in the right direction.
[01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:52.760]   Now you see, days still go,
[01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:56.920]   you see Noam Chomsky go, you see the economy roaring,
[01:27:56.920 --> 01:27:59.120]   but you really need something specifically
[01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:01.200]   on the racism part of that.
[01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:05.220]   I don't think low unemployment is going to get you there,
[01:28:05.220 --> 01:28:07.100]   although it helps a lot, obviously.
[01:28:07.100 --> 01:28:10.240]   You need something that people can't easily explain as,
[01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:12.440]   well, that's just more Obama stuff.
[01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:15.400]   You need something that's new, that's yours,
[01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:18.040]   that's visual, that's undeniable.
[01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:22.800]   And I like, for example, the Jack Johnson,
[01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:24.720]   do I have the name right, pardon?
[01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:25.560]   - Yes.
[01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:27.720]   - Because what was powerful about that
[01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:29.720]   is it didn't have to happen.
[01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:31.200]   And anybody who has in their mind,
[01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:35.400]   oh, he's just sending these racist secret dog whistles,
[01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:39.400]   you'd have to explain how that could possibly help you
[01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:42.120]   with a presumable racist base
[01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:44.280]   who would only like racist stuff.
[01:28:44.280 --> 01:28:46.020]   It's exactly the opposite
[01:28:46.020 --> 01:28:48.000]   of what their frame predicts would happen.
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.160]   - And the polls show people are waking up.
[01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:51.880]   Let's come back one more second with Scott Adams
[01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:54.600]   and find out what he thinks Trump's gonna do next
[01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:55.440]   on the other side,
[01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:57.320]   but also what happens if they assassinate Trump.
[01:28:57.320 --> 01:29:00.360]   - Want revenge on the common house fly?
[01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:02.080]   Well, after 10,000 years,
[01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:04.360]   someone has finally come up with a better way.
[01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:07.360]   The bug assault, a miniaturized shotgun,
[01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:10.520]   which utilizes ordinary table salt as ammunition,
[01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:12.480]   non-toxic and no batteries required.
[01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:15.760]   So much fun, you'll forget you have a wife and kids.

[01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:30.920]   - My name is Kevin Shipp.
[01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:33.680]   I'm a former decorated CIA officer.
[01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:35.520]   Finally, someone has come out and written
[01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:37.360]   what I think is the best ex-mosay
[01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:39.080]   on the shadow government ever.
[01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:40.720]   We're in a constitutional crisis
[01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:43.600]   and our government is now being run and ruled
[01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:44.720]   by a shadow government.
[01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:46.560]   We gotta get this out because just 'cause you're awake,
[01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:48.160]   folks, doesn't mean other people are.

[01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:06.400]   or even simple power outages,
[01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:09.640]   having a supply of storable meals is crucial.

[01:32:56.560 --> 01:33:04.320]   - You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:14.320]   [MUSIC]
[01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:23.440]   >> A lot of his supporters believe
[01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:24.680]   that we are the enemy of
[01:33:24.680 --> 01:33:25.960]   the American people.
[01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:27.080]   And that is really,
[01:33:27.080 --> 01:33:28.720]   really an awful situation.
[01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:29.800]   We are not the enemy of
[01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:30.920]   the American people.
[01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:32.400]   We love the American people.
[01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:33.280]   All right.
[01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:34.960]   Well, you know, Scott Adams,
[01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:36.720]   CNN is losing the mind war when
[01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:39.560]   their ratings are the lowest they've ever been.
[01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:41.560]   They're just local TV stations,
[01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:42.880]   just in like New York,
[01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:44.800]   have more viewers than CNN does.
[01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:46.200]   One New York TV station,
[01:33:46.200 --> 01:33:48.120]   Weather Report, has more viewers
[01:33:48.120 --> 01:33:50.320]   than they have in an hour, literally.
[01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:52.320]   We have affiliates that have hundreds
[01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:54.120]   of thousands of people tuning in
[01:33:54.120 --> 01:33:55.560]   throughout a whole show.
[01:33:55.560 --> 01:33:57.000]   They have hundreds of thousands per hour.
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:58.320]   They are a joke.
[01:33:58.320 --> 01:34:01.920]   Force fed at the government facilities,
[01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:03.360]   like the airport this morning.
[01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:04.320]   When I was in DFW,
[01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:07.000]   I'm sitting there having CNN report
[01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.240]   on IQs dropping in the US.
[01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:11.360]   Well, certainly IQs dropping over there.
[01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:12.200]   So Scott Adams,
[01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:13.800]   I brought up a negative point so
[01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:15.200]   that hopefully it doesn't happen.
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:16.240]   I don't want to be overly
[01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:16.960]   too positive.
[01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:17.640]   I mean, I don't believe like
[01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:19.360]   the Oprah thing, like the secret.
[01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:20.680]   If you just believe you're going to
[01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:22.120]   manifest a big old juicy turkey in
[01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:23.400]   front of you that just came out
[01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:25.680]   of the oven, it's not going to happen.
[01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:26.800]   But if we have the resources,
[01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:28.240]   the ideas work together.
[01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:29.360]   We've gotten to a level where we
[01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:30.560]   can have almost anything into
[01:34:30.560 --> 01:34:32.800]   the future as a culture, as a society.
[01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:34.120]   I totally agree with you and
[01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:35.720]   you've helped me be more positive
[01:34:35.720 --> 01:34:36.560]   in saying that.
[01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:38.200]   That fighting with a negative
[01:34:38.200 --> 01:34:40.040]   collectivist doesn't really do
[01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:41.200]   anything to them.
[01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:42.520]   Just succeeding and
[01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:44.360]   showing them by example,
[01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:47.040]   like Trump is doing, doggedly saying,
[01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:48.640]   give me more stuff to fix.
[01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:50.120]   And then he's attacking it,
[01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:51.640]   like a business manager.
[01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:53.280]   He's a maverick that got elected.
[01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:54.440]   He's already changed the world.
[01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:55.440]   They keep saying,
[01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:57.440]   his dad gave him a million bucks.
[01:34:57.440 --> 01:34:58.720]   Trump's a total maverick,
[01:34:58.720 --> 01:34:59.920]   never been in politics,
[01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:00.880]   comes in and wins.
[01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:02.600]   You can't slice it any other way
[01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:04.120]   than Trump is one of the most
[01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:06.280]   important people in history already.
[01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:07.840]   They say, he doesn't really want to
[01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:08.720]   win the election.
[01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:10.280]   He doesn't want to win re-election.
[01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:11.440]   He doesn't want to campaign for
[01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:12.000]   the midterms.
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.400]   He's doing all of that because Trump
[01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:16.000]   knows his name.
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:17.960]   Everything is now bound to our
[01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:18.880]   success, and
[01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:20.640]   our success is global success.
[01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:22.360]   So I have to be a cheerleader.
[01:35:22.360 --> 01:35:23.240]   But that said,
[01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:25.520]   getting into the whole racism thing,
[01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:26.640]   I totally agree.
[01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:28.400]   The minimum sentencing that's
[01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:29.640]   basically tripled for
[01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:31.320]   the type of cocaine on average
[01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:33.120]   inner city folks use, get rid of
[01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:35.520]   that, he's decriminalizing marijuana,
[01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:37.440]   something Obama would never do.
[01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:38.400]   I mean, already,
[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:40.280]   it's just insane what he's done.
[01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:42.280]   So what else positive should he do?
[01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:43.080]   A, and then B,
[01:35:43.080 --> 01:35:44.440]   what are the downsides?
[01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:46.280]   What happens if they're crazy
[01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:48.240]   enough to hype up some nut like we
[01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:49.680]   saw with shooting up the
[01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:51.680]   congressional baseball team?
[01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:53.520]   What if somebody kills Trump?
[01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:55.840]   God forbid, what would the action be
[01:35:55.840 --> 01:35:57.600]   reversing all the success?
[01:35:57.600 --> 01:35:59.720]   How angry would his supporters be?
[01:35:59.720 --> 01:36:01.760]   And then has the left pushing for
[01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:03.880]   his death everywhere even thought
[01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:05.920]   about what that would do to them,
[01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:06.840]   Scott Adams?
[01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:08.200]   So looking into crystal ball,
[01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:09.720]   I'm not wanting that to happen.
[01:36:09.720 --> 01:36:11.080]   I'm saying in that horrible reality,
[01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:11.800]   what would unfold?
[01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:14.840]   >> Yeah, I hate to think about that
[01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:16.560]   and give energy to that thought.
[01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:18.200]   But I would say the obvious,
[01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:20.040]   which is that if you imagine that
[01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:21.320]   for whatever reason,
[01:36:21.320 --> 01:36:23.160]   President Trump, let's say,
[01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:25.360]   stepped down for personal reasons.
[01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:27.920]   If the next president is a Democrat,
[01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:30.360]   I think the policies are going to be
[01:36:30.360 --> 01:36:32.840]   so similar to what Trump has done,
[01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:35.320]   that it wouldn't be as big a change
[01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:36.400]   as you think.
[01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:37.720]   Now, there'll be things like
[01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:39.080]   healthcare that might be quite
[01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:39.680]   different.
[01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:41.480]   But it's going to be hard to raise
[01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:42.480]   people's taxes.
[01:36:42.480 --> 01:36:44.440]   That's just going to be a tough sell.
[01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:45.880]   It's going to be hard to go back
[01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:46.960]   to hating North Korea.
[01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:48.440]   There's just going to be a lot of
[01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:50.080]   stuff that's going to be hard to do.
[01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:51.680]   What's he going to do?
[01:36:51.680 --> 01:36:53.840]   Reverse the pardon for Jack Johnson?
[01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:55.640]   I mean, when you come right down to
[01:36:55.640 --> 01:36:56.800]   the stuff he's done,
[01:36:56.800 --> 01:36:58.960]   it's hard to reverse it.
[01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:00.440]   But it's easier to criticize it if
[01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:01.680]   you're not in power.
[01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:02.880]   So I'd be a little less worried
[01:37:02.880 --> 01:37:03.840]   about it going bad.
[01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:05.240]   Now, I wanted to call out something
[01:37:05.240 --> 01:37:06.520]   that happened just while we were
[01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:07.200]   talking here.
[01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:09.440]   There was a tweet that came out from
[01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:11.560]   President Moon of South Korea.
[01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:13.760]   And I'm just going to call out one
[01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:16.320]   sentence, a larger statement.
[01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:17.360]   He was talking about
[01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:18.600]   the North Korea success.
[01:37:18.600 --> 01:37:20.080]   And he goes, I pay my high
[01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:22.000]   compliments for the courage and
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:23.880]   determination of two leaders,
[01:37:23.880 --> 01:37:25.360]   Trump and Chairman Kim.
[01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:27.120]   And here's the next sentence that I
[01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:28.640]   thought was worth calling out.
[01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:31.360]   He goes, not to settle for that
[01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:34.320]   outdated and familiar reality, but
[01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:36.760]   to take a daring step toward change.
[01:37:36.760 --> 01:37:39.240]   And then the next sentence he goes,
[01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:41.760]   to help break down the last remaining
[01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:43.600]   Cold War legacy on Earth.
[01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:46.280]   This is the way of thinking that's
[01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:48.040]   changing everything.
[01:37:48.040 --> 01:37:48.640]   >> Wow.
[01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:51.280]   >> It's just letting go of the past.
[01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:52.640]   It's not just Kanye,
[01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:53.800]   it's not just me,
[01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:55.760]   it's not just the President.
[01:37:55.760 --> 01:37:58.120]   It's Chairman Kim,
[01:37:58.120 --> 01:38:00.800]   it's President Moon.
[01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:02.920]   This is a new way of thinking which
[01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:05.200]   promotes the fact that our problems
[01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:07.480]   are now the way we think about them.
[01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:08.320]   They're psychological.
[01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:09.320]   >> This is so huge, let me ask you.
[01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:10.400]   >> If we deal with them that way.
[01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:11.280]   >> Let me ask you this, Scott.
[01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:13.200]   Why didn't Obama do this?
[01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:14.960]   Why couldn't they do everything
[01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:15.920]   Trump's doing?
[01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:19.840]   >> That problem is, or
[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:21.920]   that question is probably 100
[01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:23.360]   different variables.
[01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:25.520]   It'd be hard to pull out one, but
[01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:28.400]   the one that jumps out is persuasion.
[01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:30.600]   So President Trump's understanding of
[01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:31.520]   human beings,
[01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:33.640]   his understanding of persuasion,
[01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:35.480]   allows him to set priorities in
[01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:37.560]   a completely different way.
[01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:40.080]   So Obama was probably very fact-based,
[01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:42.200]   maybe tied a little bit to whatever
[01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:44.680]   is the way we've done it before.
[01:38:44.680 --> 01:38:47.200]   And those are real limitations, and
[01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:49.400]   this president doesn't seem to
[01:38:49.400 --> 01:38:51.800]   operate as if limitations exist in
[01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:53.720]   the normal way that we think
[01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:54.760]   they should.
[01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:56.440]   >> I actually would have to disagree
[01:38:56.440 --> 01:38:57.440]   with Scott on this.
[01:38:57.440 --> 01:38:58.960]   I think that it's actually very
[01:38:58.960 --> 01:39:00.480]   simple why Trump was able to get
[01:39:00.480 --> 01:39:01.720]   this done and not Obama.
[01:39:01.720 --> 01:39:03.040]   I don't think you have to look for
[01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:03.840]   many reasons at all.
[01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:05.800]   I think it's one reason he wanted
[01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:06.320]   to.
[01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:08.120]   All he had to do was have the desire
[01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:09.480]   and the will to do it, and
[01:39:09.480 --> 01:39:10.320]   he got it done.
[01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:12.000]   That is the biggest difference
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:13.480]   between Trump and Obama.
[01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:14.960]   And there's this narrative I'm
[01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:16.560]   seeing in the media right now where
[01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:18.240]   they're saying, when Obama said he
[01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:19.800]   wanted to meet with Kim Jong-un,
[01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:21.280]   and this is an attack that they
[01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:23.480]   had on Fox News, Fox News was upset.
[01:39:23.480 --> 01:39:25.240]   What if Obama met with the Iran,
[01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:27.080]   Ayatollah, and shook his hand and
[01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:28.760]   said this is a great brave man?
[01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:30.120]   Conservatives would have been
[01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:30.680]   all upset.
[01:39:30.680 --> 01:39:32.000]   But there's a fundamental
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:33.800]   difference between not just Obama,
[01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:34.960]   but Clinton and Bush and
[01:39:34.960 --> 01:39:36.280]   everyone prior to Trump.
[01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:38.080]   They didn't want to put America
[01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:38.640]   first.
[01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:39.880]   They didn't have America's
[01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:40.760]   interests first.
[01:39:40.760 --> 01:39:41.600]   They had their own special
[01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:42.520]   interests, their own agenda,
[01:39:42.520 --> 01:39:43.520]   all that. >> Exactly, we know when
[01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:44.760]   Trump's doing something, he's doing
[01:39:44.760 --> 01:39:45.680]   it for our interest, but
[01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:46.760]   that tends to help other people
[01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:47.280]   as well.
[01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:48.200]   But Scott, I think,
[01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:49.400]   understands that.
[01:39:49.400 --> 01:39:50.280]   He's just looking at it from
[01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:51.160]   a positive perspective.
[01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:52.160]   I mean, let's hear it from
[01:39:52.160 --> 01:39:53.560]   the horse's mouth himself.
[01:39:53.560 --> 01:39:55.000]   But I mean, the whole issue is
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:56.000]   you're absolutely right.
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:57.880]   Trump wants to end the Cold War for
[01:39:57.880 --> 01:39:59.840]   good, which will save us trillions
[01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:01.480]   of dollars in the aggregate.
[01:40:01.480 --> 01:40:02.560]   And let's be honest,
[01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:04.120]   a lot of the military industrial
[01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:06.040]   complex doesn't want this to happen.
[01:40:06.040 --> 01:40:07.960]   So this is a big, bold peace move,
[01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:09.880]   the likes of which we haven't seen
[01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:11.240]   since Ronald Reagan and
[01:40:11.240 --> 01:40:12.920]   the fall of the Berlin Wall.
[01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:14.480]   Scott Adams?
[01:40:14.480 --> 01:40:16.600]   >> Well, I would put my own spin on
[01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:18.600]   what you just said.
[01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:20.600]   I like to avoid saying that I know
[01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:22.360]   people's inner thoughts.
[01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:23.880]   So I usually avoid things like
[01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:25.680]   somebody who wants something unless
[01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:27.520]   they've said it in their own words.
[01:40:27.520 --> 01:40:29.200]   But the way I would put it is that,
[01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:30.960]   at least in terms of North Korea,
[01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:32.600]   what President Trump did is not
[01:40:32.600 --> 01:40:33.600]   wanting a result.
[01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:35.640]   He decided that they weren't going
[01:40:35.640 --> 01:40:37.400]   to have nuclear weapons, and
[01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:40.280]   they only had two ways to get there.
[01:40:40.280 --> 01:40:41.640]   There's the ugly way, and
[01:40:41.640 --> 01:40:43.360]   there's the awesome way.
[01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:44.600]   And the video- >> He knows how to
[01:40:44.600 --> 01:40:46.280]   make it very clear-cut choices,
[01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:48.240]   flip the script, break the mold.
[01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:49.280]   And what you said is so
[01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:50.840]   is because I've thought about this
[01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:51.360]   a lot.
[01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:52.600]   There's no turning back,
[01:40:52.600 --> 01:40:53.800]   even if they kill Trump,
[01:40:53.800 --> 01:40:55.200]   which I hope doesn't happen.
[01:40:55.200 --> 01:40:57.160]   It's already almost irreversible,
[01:40:57.160 --> 01:40:58.720]   because here came somebody on
[01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:00.640]   a cold-blooded corporation that's
[01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:02.200]   wanting more power and more money.
[01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:03.720]   Here came Trump really wanting to
[01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:04.720]   be a man of destiny and
[01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:06.400]   telling us to be part of destiny.
[01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:07.520]   This is an incredible time to
[01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:08.480]   be alive, Scott Adams.
[01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:10.040]   I hate to gush about Trump, but
[01:41:10.040 --> 01:41:11.440]   let's just say it.
[01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:12.680]   What would it be like if
[01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:14.120]   Mayor Hillary had gotten in?
[01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:16.000]   >> [LAUGH] Well,
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.840]   I can give full credit to the
[01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:19.960]   leaders.
[01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:22.000]   I think we're in a new age where,
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:23.680]   especially with a populist
[01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:25.400]   president, it's very much
[01:41:25.400 --> 01:41:27.160]   a audience participation in
[01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:29.120]   government in a way it never used
[01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:31.040]   to be, just because of the growth
[01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:33.280]   and the power of social media.
[01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:35.240]   So I think that President Trump's
[01:41:35.240 --> 01:41:36.760]   success has a lot to do with
[01:41:36.760 --> 01:41:38.760]   the number of people who are behind
[01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:40.600]   him and the energy that they give
[01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:42.560]   him, the support they give him,
[01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:44.240]   the ideas that they give him.
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:45.960]   I think you see him actually
[01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:47.880]   responding to better ideas and
[01:41:47.880 --> 01:41:49.960]   public opinion in a way we haven't
[01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:51.400]   quite seen before, and
[01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:53.240]   I mean that in a positive way.
[01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:55.360]   So we may be reaching a point- >>
[01:41:55.360 --> 01:41:56.040]   >> Critical mass?
[01:41:56.040 --> 01:41:58.280]   >> Probably after the president or
[01:41:58.280 --> 01:42:00.360]   the public and the good ideas can
[01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:01.400]   bubble up, and
[01:42:01.400 --> 01:42:03.880]   then the leaders can't ignore them.
[01:42:03.880 --> 01:42:04.920]   >> Wow, Scott Adams,
[01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:06.480]   I really appreciate your work.
[01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:08.000]   And I'm not just saying that,
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:09.360]   you've really helped me.
[01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:10.640]   I read Winn-Bigley,
[01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:11.800]   I gave it to my son.
[01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:14.120]   He's really become more positive
[01:42:14.120 --> 01:42:15.320]   because he was already real
[01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:17.040]   positive, but it's really helped me
[01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:17.720]   because I get so
[01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:18.840]   focused on the bad guys.
[01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:20.280]   I want to focus on the good guys
[01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:21.560]   more, and you and Kanye and
[01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:22.840]   Candace Owens and Trump and
[01:42:22.840 --> 01:42:23.760]   all of us together,
[01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:24.960]   it's just been amazing.
[01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:26.440]   And the fact that you don't want
[01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:27.680]   the globalists bully you,
[01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:29.160]   you're not coming on the show.
[01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:30.960]   You're a real maverick, Scott, so
[01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:32.680]   God bless you, people can follow
[01:42:32.680 --> 01:42:33.840]   you @scottadamsays and

[01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:39.040]   >> Thank you.
[01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:40.720]   >> That was powerful.
[01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:41.680]   Now let's come back and
[01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:42.640]   I get your perspective.
[01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:43.520]   I actually agree with you,
[01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:44.440]   Trump has the goodwill,
[01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:45.840]   and he said that in the video.
[01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:47.600]   So we'll talk about goodwill when
[01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:48.480]   we come back and
[01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:50.280]   we'll get into the AG report.

[01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:01.440]   dramatic than it really is.

[01:44:15.240 --> 01:44:17.000]   could lower the pH of the water to
[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:18.280]   unhealthy levels.
[01:44:18.280 --> 01:44:20.400]   To find out, we employed a series of
[01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:23.680]   tests for heavy metals, alkalinity,
[01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:24.760]   and pH.
[01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:26.040]   What we learned was that there was,
[01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:27.880]   in fact, unhealthy levels of heavy
[01:44:27.880 --> 01:44:30.480]   metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:32.360]   Next, we tested the water from our
[01:44:32.360 --> 01:44:34.400]   Alexa Pure Gravity Filter.
[01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:35.920]   And not only were the heavy metal
[01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:38.080]   levels within safe measure, but
[01:44:38.080 --> 01:44:40.640]   the pH was also restored to optimal
[01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:41.600]   levels.
[01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:42.960]   As it turns out,
[01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:45.040]   the filter on the Alexa Pure raises
[01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:46.880]   the pH of the water.
[01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:48.320]   So what we've learned is that
[01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:49.800]   volcanic ash and acid rain can
[01:44:49.800 --> 01:44:51.520]   contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:44:51.520 --> 01:44:53.960]   But more importantly,
[01:44:53.960 --> 01:44:55.960]   a good water filtration system will
[01:44:55.960 --> 01:44:56.720]   purify it.

[01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:29.600]   >> Now, I'm a very,
[01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:30.880]   very positive person.
[01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:31.840]   But over the years,
[01:47:31.840 --> 01:47:33.280]   people thought I was negative
[01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:35.040]   because I was always attacking what
[01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:36.800]   was bad the globalists were doing,
[01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:38.240]   which was critical.
[01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:39.680]   So people knew there was a private
[01:47:39.680 --> 01:47:41.120]   corporate world government above
[01:47:41.120 --> 01:47:42.440]   the law, tax exempt diplomatic
[01:47:42.440 --> 01:47:43.760]   community, that by the way,
[01:47:43.760 --> 01:47:45.360]   has an endgame of depopulation and
[01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:47.240]   is anti-Christian, anti-family,
[01:47:47.240 --> 01:47:48.560]   which is now all admitted.
[01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:50.520]   So that was a positive thing that
[01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:52.040]   we served in doing, and
[01:47:52.040 --> 01:47:53.080]   we still do it.
[01:47:53.080 --> 01:47:55.080]   Like, hey, 5G and all these studies
[01:47:55.080 --> 01:47:57.040]   gives you really bad brain cancer.
[01:47:57.040 --> 01:47:58.880]   But when you look at somebody like
[01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:00.760]   Scott Adams, it's not like Oprah
[01:48:00.760 --> 01:48:02.400]   and the Secret where you just
[01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:04.400]   imagine you're going to materialize
[01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:06.400]   100 carat diamond in front of you.
[01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:07.560]   You got to go to Africa,
[01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:09.000]   you got to dig in the ground,
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:10.320]   you got to find it, okay?
[01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:12.240]   You got to have the wherewithal,
[01:48:12.240 --> 01:48:14.280]   you got to have the mining skills,
[01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:15.960]   but we had the technology.
[01:48:15.960 --> 01:48:17.960]   And for whatever it is we want to
[01:48:17.960 --> 01:48:19.880]   do, we can now basically like
[01:48:19.880 --> 01:48:21.960]   little g, made in God's image,
[01:48:21.960 --> 01:48:24.240]   create things, do amazing things.
[01:48:24.240 --> 01:48:26.200]   But we can also have bad people get
[01:48:26.200 --> 01:48:28.000]   control of human intellect and
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:29.680]   do really horrible things.
[01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:31.760]   And those are the people that crave
[01:48:31.760 --> 01:48:32.440]   control.
[01:48:32.440 --> 01:48:34.520]   And I want to play this video,
[01:48:34.520 --> 01:48:36.920]   this is an edited down trailer from
[01:48:36.920 --> 01:48:38.360]   Get Me Roger Stone.
[01:48:38.360 --> 01:48:40.080]   I want to find the HD version
[01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:41.760]   somewhere around here in our
[01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:42.800]   databanks, but
[01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:44.320]   I found this on YouTube.
[01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:47.320]   And this is why they hate us.
[01:48:47.320 --> 01:48:49.000]   If you want to know why they want
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:49.920]   to shut us down,
[01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:51.560]   why they demonize Infowars,
[01:48:51.560 --> 01:48:53.040]   why they demonize Trump,
[01:48:53.040 --> 01:48:54.040]   is the winning.
[01:48:54.040 --> 01:48:56.200]   And they want us to forget about
[01:48:56.200 --> 01:48:58.400]   the winning and say, they won
[01:48:58.400 --> 01:49:01.000]   because they're Russians, yeah.
[01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:04.760]   And I'm a blue butted baboon too.
[01:49:04.760 --> 01:49:06.520]   I mean, that's ridiculous.
[01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:10.160]   But again, change the subject from
[01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:11.120]   the WikiLeaks and
[01:49:11.120 --> 01:49:12.920]   what's in them to the Russians.
[01:49:12.920 --> 01:49:14.440]   Two plus years later,
[01:49:14.440 --> 01:49:15.120]   no proof of that.
[01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:16.280]   And now the AG report,
[01:49:16.280 --> 01:49:17.400]   pieces of it are out,
[01:49:17.400 --> 01:49:18.960]   it hasn't fully come out yet.
[01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:20.760]   But it's what we already know,
[01:49:20.760 --> 01:49:22.240]   we've got Comey working.
[01:49:22.240 --> 01:49:24.640]   And you've got others working with
[01:49:24.640 --> 01:49:26.040]   the Clintons to let them know what
[01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:26.700]   was coming and
[01:49:26.700 --> 01:49:28.120]   letting witnesses know they were
[01:49:28.120 --> 01:49:28.960]   going to be called.
[01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:30.280]   It's witness tampering,
[01:49:30.280 --> 01:49:31.880]   it's obstruction of justice,
[01:49:31.880 --> 01:49:33.920]   it's absconding, it's conspiracy,
[01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:35.800]   it's racketeering, it's- >> It's
[01:49:35.800 --> 01:49:36.960]   high treason.
[01:49:36.960 --> 01:49:38.600]   >> It's criminal, because it is
[01:49:38.600 --> 01:49:40.560]   high treason because it's against
[01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:42.680]   the country and against the voters.
[01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:44.080]   We don't have a king in this
[01:49:44.080 --> 01:49:45.680]   country, we have the voters.
[01:49:45.680 --> 01:49:46.880]   We have the Constitution,
[01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:47.600]   Bill of Rights.
[01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:49.080]   And when you're trying to overturn
[01:49:49.080 --> 01:49:49.680]   that system,
[01:49:49.680 --> 01:49:50.940]   you can do anything you want in
[01:49:50.940 --> 01:49:51.940]   this country.
[01:49:51.940 --> 01:49:53.260]   But you can't try to overturn
[01:49:53.260 --> 01:49:54.300]   people's rights.
[01:49:54.300 --> 01:49:55.980]   In a republic, the minority rights
[01:49:55.980 --> 01:49:57.020]   are guarded just like
[01:49:57.020 --> 01:49:58.420]   the majority rights.
[01:49:58.420 --> 01:50:00.020]   >> Well, let's be perfectly clear,
[01:50:00.020 --> 01:50:01.340]   if they want to complain about
[01:50:01.340 --> 01:50:02.380]   rigging elections,
[01:50:02.380 --> 01:50:04.100]   how is protecting Hillary Clinton,
[01:50:04.100 --> 01:50:05.220]   one of the candidates,
[01:50:05.220 --> 01:50:06.740]   not trying to rig an election?
[01:50:06.740 --> 01:50:08.100]   The woman should have been
[01:50:08.100 --> 01:50:10.100]   prosecuted, maybe even been serving
[01:50:10.100 --> 01:50:11.300]   a sentence while she was
[01:50:11.300 --> 01:50:12.220]   campaigning.
[01:50:12.220 --> 01:50:13.480]   >> Maybe even, I mean,
[01:50:13.480 --> 01:50:15.380]   the train of criminal activity is
[01:50:15.380 --> 01:50:16.180]   dizzying.
[01:50:16.180 --> 01:50:17.760]   >> I'm sorry, absolutely should
[01:50:17.760 --> 01:50:18.700]   have been in jail,
[01:50:18.700 --> 01:50:20.300]   perhaps even worse.
[01:50:20.300 --> 01:50:21.920]   >> So you want to know why they
[01:50:21.920 --> 01:50:22.580]   hate us and
[01:50:22.580 --> 01:50:24.440]   why they changed the subject.
[01:50:24.440 --> 01:50:26.100]   When the Japanese Prime Minister
[01:50:26.100 --> 01:50:27.580]   throws out a little bit of the
[01:50:27.580 --> 01:50:29.020]   food to get the fish up to the
[01:50:29.020 --> 01:50:29.840]   water, hell,
[01:50:29.840 --> 01:50:31.780]   we do the same way here.
[01:50:31.780 --> 01:50:32.880]   A lot of folks I know have a little
[01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:33.740]   pond in their backyard,
[01:50:33.740 --> 01:50:34.860]   they got bass and a catfish.
[01:50:34.860 --> 01:50:36.040]   You throw a few little pieces in
[01:50:36.040 --> 01:50:37.380]   and get them up to where you're at.
[01:50:37.380 --> 01:50:38.980]   You throw the whole little bucket
[01:50:38.980 --> 01:50:40.140]   in, you feed the fish.
[01:50:40.140 --> 01:50:41.300]   People have stock ponds,
[01:50:41.300 --> 01:50:43.060]   have those, he dumps it all in.
[01:50:43.060 --> 01:50:44.140]   They turn that into,
[01:50:44.140 --> 01:50:45.660]   look at how he's inept.
[01:50:45.660 --> 01:50:47.300]   because they know he's a cheerleader
[01:50:47.300 --> 01:50:47.940]   for America.
[01:50:47.940 --> 01:50:49.020]   >> The fact that they've had to
[01:50:49.020 --> 01:50:50.100]   admit, in fact, let's keep
[01:50:50.100 --> 01:50:51.140]   the Bill Maher after this.
[01:50:51.140 --> 01:50:52.060]   I wanted to play that again
[01:50:52.060 --> 01:50:52.900]   yesterday, I didn't.
[01:50:52.900 --> 01:50:54.180]   Bill Maher, he said this week and
[01:50:54.180 --> 01:50:54.740]   a half ago,
[01:50:54.740 --> 01:50:56.100]   we should play this every day.
[01:50:56.100 --> 01:50:57.340]   He says, I want to plunge
[01:50:57.340 --> 01:50:58.340]   the economy.
[01:50:58.340 --> 01:51:00.580]   I want a crashing economy so
[01:51:00.580 --> 01:51:03.420]   that we can stop the Trump agenda.
[01:51:03.420 --> 01:51:05.460]   >> No, Alex, you- >> And yay, yay,
[01:51:05.460 --> 01:51:07.460]   ruin, I mean, these people are,
[01:51:07.460 --> 01:51:09.260]   what have I tell you every day?
[01:51:09.260 --> 01:51:10.660]   They want to make you poor,
[01:51:10.660 --> 01:51:11.940]   it's called feudalism.
[01:51:11.940 --> 01:51:12.900]   >> And then you play this,
[01:51:12.900 --> 01:51:14.220]   you play Bill Maher saying we want
[01:51:14.220 --> 01:51:15.300]   to collapse the economy.
[01:51:15.300 --> 01:51:16.740]   Then you play the wolf saying we
[01:51:16.740 --> 01:51:18.140]   want there to be nuclear war with
[01:51:18.140 --> 01:51:18.740]   North Korea.
[01:51:18.740 --> 01:51:20.780]   That's all you need to do.
[01:51:20.780 --> 01:51:22.540]   I mean, that tells you their entire
[01:51:22.540 --> 01:51:23.460]   mindset, Alex.
[01:51:23.460 --> 01:51:24.680]   >> And we've got Bill Maher
[01:51:24.680 --> 01:51:25.900]   famously always saying,
[01:51:25.900 --> 01:51:26.940]   I want more abortion,
[01:51:26.940 --> 01:51:28.420]   I want suicide, I want death,
[01:51:28.420 --> 01:51:30.220]   I want less people on the highway.
[01:51:30.220 --> 01:51:32.080]   Idiot, millions of people in
[01:51:32.080 --> 01:51:34.420]   megacities build the infrastructure
[01:51:34.420 --> 01:51:35.540]   for the highways,
[01:51:35.540 --> 01:51:37.460]   for the golf courses, moron.
[01:51:37.460 --> 01:51:39.060]   >> I said- >> You're a moron,
[01:51:39.060 --> 01:51:40.900]   boom cities are booms because
[01:51:40.900 --> 01:51:42.020]   they're booms.
[01:51:42.020 --> 01:51:43.220]   And I explain this,
[01:51:43.220 --> 01:51:45.060]   you can go 100 miles in most area
[01:51:45.060 --> 01:51:46.980]   of the ocean before you hit a reef
[01:51:46.980 --> 01:51:48.380]   area, the proper sun,
[01:51:48.380 --> 01:51:49.460]   shallow enough.
[01:51:49.460 --> 01:51:51.060]   And you'll have more biodiversity
[01:51:51.060 --> 01:51:52.500]   in just a few square miles than you
[01:51:52.500 --> 01:51:54.020]   have in hundreds of square miles.
[01:51:54.020 --> 01:51:55.060]   Do the fish go, man,
[01:51:55.060 --> 01:51:56.860]   this reef's really crowded.
[01:51:56.860 --> 01:51:57.780]   No, they're like,
[01:51:57.780 --> 01:51:59.300]   this is where all the food's at,
[01:51:59.300 --> 01:51:59.800]   man.
[01:51:59.800 --> 01:52:01.380]   Bill Maher flies over LA and
[01:52:01.380 --> 01:52:04.140]   goes, God, I hate all these people.
[01:52:04.140 --> 01:52:05.380]   And yeah, they're a bunch of
[01:52:05.380 --> 01:52:06.580]   miserable followers of you.
[01:52:06.580 --> 01:52:07.660]   >> Well, Bill Maher,
[01:52:07.660 --> 01:52:09.460]   I actually appreciate Bill Maher
[01:52:09.460 --> 01:52:10.840]   showing the true face of
[01:52:10.840 --> 01:52:12.700]   the American left right now that
[01:52:12.700 --> 01:52:14.940]   wants to collapse the economy.
[01:52:14.940 --> 01:52:15.660]   What do I tell you?
[01:52:15.660 --> 01:52:16.540]   They hate you,
[01:52:16.540 --> 01:52:17.980]   they want to abort you,
[01:52:17.980 --> 01:52:19.380]   they want your money,
[01:52:19.380 --> 01:52:21.260]   they're devil worshippers.
[01:52:21.260 --> 01:52:23.100]   And doesn't matter if he gets into
[01:52:23.100 --> 01:52:24.460]   a red pajamas at night,
[01:52:24.460 --> 01:52:26.380]   which he probably does actually,
[01:52:26.380 --> 01:52:27.780]   most of them do in LA, but
[01:52:27.780 --> 01:52:30.060]   his spirit is satanic.
[01:52:30.060 --> 01:52:32.980]   It's a win-loser mentality.
[01:52:32.980 --> 01:52:35.020]   We are non-zero-sum game.
[01:52:35.020 --> 01:52:37.020]   We are 360 win.
[01:52:37.020 --> 01:52:38.460]   >> Well, and then you see not just
[01:52:38.460 --> 01:52:39.780]   what he says about wanting to
[01:52:39.780 --> 01:52:41.540]   collapse the economy, but the lies,
[01:52:41.540 --> 01:52:42.780]   the misrepresentation,
[01:52:42.780 --> 01:52:43.820]   how he attacks you.
[01:52:43.820 --> 01:52:45.020]   I mean, it's just totally
[01:52:45.020 --> 01:52:46.380]   classless, it's uncouth.
[01:52:46.380 --> 01:52:47.540]   >> The guy's a total fraud,
[01:52:47.540 --> 01:52:48.820]   reading on total property.
[01:52:48.820 --> 01:52:50.660]   And the reason I say that is he's
[01:52:50.660 --> 01:52:52.700]   such a joke, he's such a coward.
[01:52:52.700 --> 01:52:54.540]   Now, since I said it,
[01:52:54.540 --> 01:52:56.060]   let's go ahead and
[01:52:56.060 --> 01:52:57.940]   play Why They Hate Us.
[01:52:57.940 --> 01:53:01.820]   Remember, this is Why They Hate Us.
[01:53:01.820 --> 01:53:02.860]   If you're a radio listener,
[01:53:02.860 --> 01:53:04.180]   it's powerful, but not as powerful
[01:53:04.180 --> 01:53:05.020]   as you're a TV viewer.
[01:53:05.020 --> 01:53:06.300]   You can actually see the crying and
[01:53:06.300 --> 01:53:06.860]   everything.
[01:53:06.860 --> 01:53:08.260]   Here was election night a year and
[01:53:08.260 --> 01:53:08.780]   a half ago.
[01:53:08.780 --> 01:53:10.420]   >> Some of my colleagues at
[01:53:10.420 --> 01:53:12.700]   Trump Tower just a few minutes ago,
[01:53:12.700 --> 01:53:15.380]   there's a little optimism here.
[01:53:15.380 --> 01:53:16.420]   >> No one thought it was going to
[01:53:16.420 --> 01:53:17.460]   be this close at this point.
[01:53:17.460 --> 01:53:18.540]   Trump can still win this thing.
[01:53:18.540 --> 01:53:19.420]   >> We have another state to
[01:53:19.420 --> 01:53:20.340]   project it as the state of
[01:53:20.340 --> 01:53:21.060]   North Carolina,
[01:53:21.060 --> 01:53:22.060]   a big battleground state.
[01:53:22.060 --> 01:53:22.900]   It's going to Donald Trump.
[01:53:22.900 --> 01:53:24.460]   >> I was actually ready to go to
[01:53:24.460 --> 01:53:26.260]   bed, and then I started seeing
[01:53:26.260 --> 01:53:28.340]   the electoral college come in, and
[01:53:28.340 --> 01:53:29.500]   I'm super psyched.
[01:53:29.500 --> 01:53:31.060]   >> This is going to be a very
[01:53:31.060 --> 01:53:32.380]   close election.
[01:53:32.380 --> 01:53:34.260]   >> I'm seeing these late breaking
[01:53:34.260 --> 01:53:34.860]   trends.
[01:53:34.860 --> 01:53:36.220]   This could hand Trump the
[01:53:36.220 --> 01:53:37.460]   presidency, folks.
[01:53:37.460 --> 01:53:39.700]   This is not by any means over.
[01:53:39.700 --> 01:53:41.020]   >> I think there's some real
[01:53:41.020 --> 01:53:42.180]   jitters setting in, and
[01:53:42.180 --> 01:53:43.500]   Hillary Clinton headquarters
[01:53:43.500 --> 01:53:44.100]   right now.
[01:53:44.100 --> 01:53:45.380]   >> The scene here is so
[01:53:45.380 --> 01:53:47.460]   different than it was a few hours
[01:53:47.460 --> 01:53:49.340]   ago when people were happy and
[01:53:49.340 --> 01:53:50.060]   relaxed.
[01:53:50.060 --> 01:53:52.100]   >> This is most unexpected.
[01:53:52.100 --> 01:53:53.820]   >> Certainly is a huge, huge
[01:53:53.820 --> 01:53:55.780]   surprise to so many people out
[01:53:55.780 --> 01:53:56.340]   there.
[01:53:56.340 --> 01:53:57.900]   >> I think we all thought it
[01:53:57.900 --> 01:54:00.140]   couldn't happen, that he couldn't
[01:54:00.140 --> 01:54:02.020]   do what he did, and guess what?
[01:54:02.020 --> 01:54:03.780]   He may just do it.
[01:54:03.780 --> 01:54:05.700]   >> Donald Trump has taken the
[01:54:05.700 --> 01:54:08.420]   lead, he has 216 electoral votes.
[01:54:08.420 --> 01:54:09.260]   >> This is truly the beginning of
[01:54:09.260 --> 01:54:09.760]   the end.
[01:54:09.760 --> 01:54:10.700]   >> He was born the head of
[01:54:10.700 --> 01:54:11.380]   Hillary Clinton.
[01:54:11.380 --> 01:54:12.820]   >> We told them they couldn't get
[01:54:12.820 --> 01:54:14.260]   Trump, and now they got Trump.
[01:54:14.260 --> 01:54:15.500]   What do we do?
[01:54:15.500 --> 01:54:16.660]   >> It's Megyn Kelly,
[01:54:16.660 --> 01:54:17.620]   we run things.
[01:54:17.620 --> 01:54:19.100]   >> Notice where Megyn Kelly is
[01:54:19.100 --> 01:54:20.020]   today, no way.
[01:54:20.020 --> 01:54:21.620]   >> How do I explain this to my
[01:54:21.620 --> 01:54:22.380]   children?
[01:54:22.380 --> 01:54:23.700]   I have Muslim friends- >> She's
[01:54:23.700 --> 01:54:24.660]   heading down with Sirpi.
[01:54:24.660 --> 01:54:25.380]   >> Who are texting me tonight.
[01:54:25.380 --> 01:54:26.180]   >> Who, Megyn who?
[01:54:26.180 --> 01:54:27.060]   >> Saying, should I leave
[01:54:27.060 --> 01:54:27.620]   the country?
[01:54:27.620 --> 01:54:29.060]   >> Megyn, America is- >> America is
[01:54:29.060 --> 01:54:29.860]   crying tonight.
[01:54:29.860 --> 01:54:31.780]   I'm not sure how much of America,
[01:54:31.780 --> 01:54:33.460]   but a very, very significant
[01:54:33.460 --> 01:54:35.620]   portion, I mean, literally crying.
[01:54:35.620 --> 01:54:39.620]   [APPLAUSE]
[01:54:39.620 --> 01:54:40.580]   >> Hillary, this is a
[01:54:40.580 --> 01:54:41.660]   very unexpected turn.
[01:54:41.660 --> 01:54:43.300]   >> This is part of the champagne
[01:54:43.300 --> 01:54:44.140]   glasses too.
[01:54:44.140 --> 01:54:44.980]   >> President,
[01:54:44.980 --> 01:54:45.940]   you're late.
[01:54:45.940 --> 01:54:47.220]   >> Donald Trump,
[01:54:47.220 --> 01:54:49.020]   will Donald Trump be
[01:54:49.020 --> 01:54:52.180]   the President of the United States?
[01:54:52.180 --> 01:54:53.700]   >> Yeah.
[01:54:53.700 --> 01:54:54.700]   >> The fast and
[01:54:54.700 --> 01:54:56.620]   deplorable has arrived.
[01:54:56.620 --> 01:54:59.300]   >> People have talked about
[01:54:59.300 --> 01:55:00.500]   a miracle.
[01:55:00.500 --> 01:55:02.860]   I'm hearing about a nightmare.
[01:55:02.860 --> 01:55:05.820]   >> This is your life now,
[01:55:05.820 --> 01:55:09.980]   this is us, this is our country.
[01:55:09.980 --> 01:55:11.900]   >> It's a miracle, we saved
[01:55:11.900 --> 01:55:13.180]   America.
[01:55:13.180 --> 01:55:14.780]   >> And now it's reverse everything
[01:55:14.780 --> 01:55:15.900]   because the globalists
[01:55:15.900 --> 01:55:17.140]   are austerity based.
[01:55:17.140 --> 01:55:18.300]   They say you can't have cars,
[01:55:18.300 --> 01:55:19.580]   you can't have air conditioners,
[01:55:19.580 --> 01:55:20.620]   you've got to be poor.
[01:55:20.620 --> 01:55:22.020]   They say we want to make you poor
[01:55:22.020 --> 01:55:23.500]   for the betterment of the earth,
[01:55:23.500 --> 01:55:25.020]   but they're all going to be filthy
[01:55:25.020 --> 01:55:26.300]   rich and tax exempt again.
[01:55:26.300 --> 01:55:28.060]   Now, let's play this Bill Maher
[01:55:28.060 --> 01:55:29.820]   clip because you just can't play
[01:55:29.820 --> 01:55:30.660]   this enough.
[01:55:30.660 --> 01:55:31.660]   Where he says,
[01:55:31.660 --> 01:55:33.540]   I want a crashing economy.
[01:55:33.540 --> 01:55:35.060]   This is a man reportedly worth,
[01:55:35.060 --> 01:55:36.940]   I don't know that Celebrity Network
[01:55:36.940 --> 01:55:38.700]   site's right, because it says I'm
[01:55:38.700 --> 01:55:40.620]   worth $100 million and that's about
[01:55:40.620 --> 01:55:41.980]   five times what I'm worth.
[01:55:41.980 --> 01:55:43.500]   Which I'm not trying to just be
[01:55:43.500 --> 01:55:44.300]   worth money,
[01:55:44.300 --> 01:55:45.900]   I put it back in the operation.
[01:55:45.900 --> 01:55:47.060]   We got a little bit of money to
[01:55:47.060 --> 01:55:48.340]   help fight lawsuits, whatever,
[01:55:48.340 --> 01:55:49.580]   stored up as an emergency nest egg
[01:55:49.580 --> 01:55:50.460]   that could run things for
[01:55:50.460 --> 01:55:51.020]   a few months.
[01:55:51.020 --> 01:55:52.500]   My goal is to change the world,
[01:55:52.500 --> 01:55:53.620]   my currency is ideas.
[01:55:53.620 --> 01:55:55.300]   So I don't know if it's right, but
[01:55:55.300 --> 01:55:56.620]   I know his contract's like
[01:55:56.620 --> 01:55:57.580]   10 million a year.
[01:55:57.580 --> 01:56:00.500]   He's reportedly worth $100 million.
[01:56:00.500 --> 01:56:02.500]   And he says, I'm sorry,
[01:56:02.500 --> 01:56:04.660]   I know it's going to hurt.
[01:56:04.660 --> 01:56:06.980]   But we really, really, really,
[01:56:06.980 --> 01:56:09.460]   really need to crash the economy to
[01:56:09.460 --> 01:56:10.420]   hurt Trump.
[01:56:10.420 --> 01:56:11.380]   So let's go ahead and
[01:56:11.380 --> 01:56:12.140]   roll that clip.
[01:56:12.140 --> 01:56:13.940]   >> Can I ask about the economy
[01:56:13.940 --> 01:56:15.900]   because this economy is going
[01:56:15.900 --> 01:56:16.900]   pretty well.
[01:56:16.900 --> 01:56:18.300]   We have to, what?
[01:56:18.300 --> 01:56:19.780]   Why is that funny?
[01:56:19.780 --> 01:56:21.380]   >> It is going well for now.
[01:56:21.380 --> 01:56:22.420]   >> For now, right,
[01:56:22.420 --> 01:56:23.780]   that's my question.
[01:56:23.780 --> 01:56:24.860]   [LAUGH] >> Is like,
[01:56:24.860 --> 01:56:26.740]   I feel like the bottom has to fall
[01:56:26.740 --> 01:56:27.900]   out at some point.
[01:56:27.900 --> 01:56:29.820]   And by the way, I'm hoping for it,
[01:56:29.820 --> 01:56:31.700]   because I think one way you get rid
[01:56:31.700 --> 01:56:33.540]   of Trump is a crashing economy.
[01:56:33.540 --> 01:56:35.500]   So please bring on the recession.
[01:56:35.500 --> 01:56:36.660]   Sorry if that hurts people.
[01:56:36.660 --> 01:56:38.700]   >> Sorry if it hurts some people.
[01:56:38.700 --> 01:56:39.380]   >> Yeah, yeah. >> Yeah,
[01:56:39.380 --> 01:56:40.540]   because you'll weather it real
[01:56:40.540 --> 01:56:42.380]   fine with $100 million.
[01:56:42.380 --> 01:56:43.540]   >> No, that's the key right there.
[01:56:43.540 --> 01:56:44.580]   That is the arrogance.
[01:56:44.580 --> 01:56:47.140]   That is the mindset of a Bill Maher
[01:56:47.140 --> 01:56:49.460]   where he knows, I'll be fine.
[01:56:49.460 --> 01:56:51.340]   And all the poor people that I
[01:56:51.340 --> 01:56:53.500]   claim to speak up for, they might
[01:56:53.500 --> 01:56:55.460]   have to go through some serious
[01:56:55.460 --> 01:56:57.620]   troubles if there was a collapse
[01:56:57.620 --> 01:57:00.060]   of the economy, which I'm cheering
[01:57:00.060 --> 01:57:01.100]   on, but good.
[01:57:01.100 --> 01:57:02.260]   It'll show those Trump supporters.
[01:57:02.260 --> 01:57:03.260]   It'll show Trump.
[01:57:03.260 --> 01:57:04.860]   It'll show the world that we're
[01:57:04.860 --> 01:57:06.180]   the good guys that crashed
[01:57:06.180 --> 01:57:08.420]   the economy and wanted nuclear war.
[01:57:08.420 --> 01:57:09.180]   Don't you see?
[01:57:09.180 --> 01:57:10.220]   We're the good guys.
[01:57:10.220 --> 01:57:11.420]   >> And it's the same Democrats
[01:57:11.420 --> 01:57:12.500]   suing us to shut us down.
[01:57:12.500 --> 01:57:13.940]   I want to hire a bunch of people.
[01:57:13.940 --> 01:57:14.780]   I want to give people like
[01:57:14.780 --> 01:57:15.700]   Owen a raise.
[01:57:15.700 --> 01:57:17.220]   I want to have affiliates all over
[01:57:17.220 --> 01:57:17.820]   the world.
[01:57:17.820 --> 01:57:19.060]   I want to build new websites,
[01:57:19.060 --> 01:57:20.500]   more films, but we need a lot of
[01:57:20.500 --> 01:57:21.740]   money to do it and be able to
[01:57:21.740 --> 01:57:23.300]   operate, ladies and gentlemen,

[01:57:54.060 --> 01:57:56.020]   >> I've been following you since
[01:57:56.020 --> 01:57:57.780]   I was 14, and I'm 32 now.
[01:57:57.780 --> 01:57:59.820]   I remember back when Infowars and
[01:57:59.820 --> 01:58:01.780]   Prison Planet, it was just blue
[01:58:01.780 --> 01:58:03.780]   text on a white screen, and I had
[01:58:03.780 --> 01:58:05.780]   to load down the page on my dial
[01:58:05.780 --> 01:58:07.100]   up internet, and I thought it was
[01:58:07.100 --> 01:58:07.700]   pretty cool.
[01:58:07.700 --> 01:58:08.900]   And read all the books and
[01:58:08.900 --> 01:58:10.420]   seen all the DVDs and
[01:58:10.420 --> 01:58:11.540]   followed all your guests.
[01:58:11.540 --> 01:58:12.820]   And I've been using your product
[01:58:12.820 --> 01:58:14.260]   since the first iteration of
[01:58:14.260 --> 01:58:15.260]   Survival Shield.
[01:58:15.260 --> 01:58:17.100]   And since then, I'm on the X2,

[01:58:23.140 --> 01:58:23.820]   >> Thank you, brother.
[01:58:23.820 --> 01:58:25.300]   >> Yeah, and I wanted to say that
[01:58:25.300 --> 01:58:27.060]   by following you so much,
[01:58:27.060 --> 01:58:28.900]   it's like you're just detoxing
[01:58:28.900 --> 01:58:30.380]   the mind, you're detoxing
[01:58:30.380 --> 01:58:31.780]   the body, you're detoxing
[01:58:31.780 --> 01:58:32.380]   the spirit.
[01:58:32.380 --> 01:58:34.100]   And it's just the more you know
[01:58:34.100 --> 01:58:35.860]   God, the more you fear God, but
[01:58:35.860 --> 01:58:37.220]   the more you chase God.
[01:58:37.220 --> 01:58:38.780]   And I wanted to say that it's
[01:58:38.780 --> 01:58:40.420]   an honor to stand side by side
[01:58:40.420 --> 01:58:41.740]   with you, the crew, and

[02:00:19.460 --> 02:00:20.860]   >> You're not going to be willing
[02:00:20.860 --> 02:00:21.660]   to that fight.
[02:00:21.660 --> 02:00:23.220]   >> 21 at this point.

[02:02:13.340 --> 02:02:16.380]   I'm going to play a short clip of
[02:02:16.380 --> 02:02:19.260]   it now, of why the Democrats hate
[02:02:19.260 --> 02:02:21.980]   Trump and hate me and hate you so
[02:02:21.980 --> 02:02:25.020]   much, because you're victory.
[02:02:25.020 --> 02:02:26.620]   If you're straight and strong and
[02:02:26.620 --> 02:02:27.660]   good and honorable,
[02:02:27.660 --> 02:02:29.260]   these criminals don't like you.
[02:02:29.260 --> 02:02:31.180]   And the realization that they are
[02:02:31.180 --> 02:02:33.180]   mentally ill, control freaks,
[02:02:33.180 --> 02:02:35.020]   virtue signalers at the lowest
[02:02:35.020 --> 02:02:36.940]   level, and social engineer,
[02:02:36.940 --> 02:02:38.700]   control freaks at the top.
[02:02:38.700 --> 02:02:41.020]   Once you have that realization,
[02:02:41.020 --> 02:02:42.700]   there's no going back,
[02:02:42.700 --> 02:02:44.380]   ladies and gentlemen.
[02:02:44.380 --> 02:02:45.500]   And that's the crazy thing
[02:02:45.500 --> 02:02:46.780]   Democrats have to understand.
[02:02:46.780 --> 02:02:47.980]   They could destroy Trump,
[02:02:47.980 --> 02:02:49.260]   you're not going to reverse
[02:02:49.260 --> 02:02:50.780]   the change, the ideas that have
[02:02:50.780 --> 02:02:51.900]   been put out there.
[02:02:51.900 --> 02:02:53.020]   You're not going to reverse
[02:02:53.020 --> 02:02:54.460]   nationalism and populism spreading
[02:02:54.460 --> 02:02:55.900]   all over the world, like I told you.
[02:02:55.900 --> 02:02:57.260]   Once you ignite the fires of
[02:02:57.260 --> 02:02:59.020]   liberty, they're unstoppable in
[02:02:59.020 --> 02:02:59.660]   this phase.
[02:02:59.660 --> 02:03:02.220]   We hit the bottom of the decadence
[02:03:02.220 --> 02:03:02.860]   curve.
[02:03:02.860 --> 02:03:04.540]   Now, the liberty cycle is
[02:03:04.540 --> 02:03:05.500]   reigniting.
[02:03:05.500 --> 02:03:07.340]   We're entering the beginning of
[02:03:07.340 --> 02:03:09.420]   the cycle, at the end of the cycle,
[02:03:09.420 --> 02:03:11.340]   we're in that no man's land right
[02:03:11.340 --> 02:03:13.420]   now, and they won't be able to ever
[02:03:13.420 --> 02:03:14.380]   reverse that.
[02:03:14.380 --> 02:03:15.580]   Now, things are going to get
[02:03:15.580 --> 02:03:17.180]   bloody, they're going to get crazy
[02:03:17.180 --> 02:03:17.980]   in many levels.
[02:03:17.980 --> 02:03:19.660]   The enemy is going to keep pushing
[02:03:19.660 --> 02:03:20.380]   and pushing.
[02:03:20.380 --> 02:03:21.740]   They're going to get more
[02:03:21.740 --> 02:03:23.180]   vitriolic, more insane,
[02:03:23.180 --> 02:03:24.940]   more negative, more bizarre.
[02:03:24.940 --> 02:03:27.260]   But we have to understand that we're
[02:03:27.260 --> 02:03:28.940]   going to stay the course.
[02:03:28.940 --> 02:03:31.260]   And the stronger and more focused
[02:03:31.260 --> 02:03:32.860]   and undaunted we are,
[02:03:32.860 --> 02:03:34.860]   the more dauntless we are,
[02:03:34.860 --> 02:03:36.940]   the more invincible we are.
[02:03:36.940 --> 02:03:39.500]   And it's that simple, but
[02:03:39.500 --> 02:03:41.820]   this is why they hate us.
[02:03:41.820 --> 02:03:44.540]   And if the Democrats symbolically
[02:03:44.540 --> 02:03:47.420]   think destroying me will resurrect
[02:03:47.420 --> 02:03:50.300]   them, that's great news that that's
[02:03:50.300 --> 02:03:53.020]   the 2020 re-election operation,
[02:03:53.020 --> 02:03:55.500]   is to have Sandy Hook lawsuits going.
[02:03:55.500 --> 02:03:56.300]   It's come out,
[02:03:56.300 --> 02:03:57.980]   they admit it in newspapers,
[02:03:57.980 --> 02:03:59.980]   to try to have it timed to have jury
[02:03:59.980 --> 02:04:01.820]   trials going against me during
[02:04:01.820 --> 02:04:03.900]   the 2020 election in about a year
[02:04:03.900 --> 02:04:04.620]   and a half.
[02:04:04.620 --> 02:04:09.260]   To make that make Trump look bad.
[02:04:09.260 --> 02:04:11.100]   How is that going to fly without
[02:04:11.100 --> 02:04:12.780]   they twist things and lie and

[02:04:16.700 --> 02:04:17.980]   How is that going to fly?
[02:04:19.980 --> 02:04:21.340]   When you've got the peace deals,
[02:04:21.340 --> 02:04:22.460]   the economy coming back and
[02:04:22.460 --> 02:04:23.820]   getting rid of minimum sentencing

[02:04:28.460 --> 02:04:29.420]   Let's go out to break with why
[02:04:29.420 --> 02:04:29.980]   they hate us.

[02:07:34.320 --> 02:07:36.720]   broadcasting worldwide,
[02:07:36.720 --> 02:07:38.400]   it's Alex Jones.
[02:07:38.400 --> 02:07:40.000]   >> All right, Dr.
[02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:43.200]   Shiva is running against the fake Indian,
[02:07:43.200 --> 02:07:46.480]   the real Indian is running against her.
[02:07:46.480 --> 02:07:47.200]   They've been demonizing him,
[02:07:47.200 --> 02:07:48.560]   trying to ban his free speech.
[02:07:48.560 --> 02:07:49.840]   He's coming up next segment.
[02:07:49.840 --> 02:07:52.400]   He's got exclusive breaking news for us.
[02:07:52.400 --> 02:07:54.480]   He'll ride shotgun covering the waterfront
[02:07:54.480 --> 02:07:56.080]   for 45 minutes of the hour.
[02:07:56.080 --> 02:07:57.120]   We're going to break here in about
[02:07:57.120 --> 02:07:57.680]   eight minutes.
[02:07:57.680 --> 02:08:00.160]   Before I go any further,
[02:08:00.160 --> 02:08:01.520]   there's a lot of news here
[02:08:01.520 --> 02:08:03.920]   that I haven't gotten to.
[02:08:03.920 --> 02:08:05.840]   And you've got the AG report coming out.
[02:08:06.560 --> 02:08:08.960]   And Tom Fenton of Judicial Watch
[02:08:08.960 --> 02:08:10.800]   reportedly has already seen it.
[02:08:10.800 --> 02:08:11.600]   And it's what we thought.
[02:08:11.600 --> 02:08:13.840]   It's a whitewash, but
[02:08:13.840 --> 02:08:15.440]   it's still a devastating whitewash.
[02:08:15.440 --> 02:08:18.240]   because you can paint a big old,
[02:08:18.240 --> 02:08:18.960]   you know what,
[02:08:18.960 --> 02:08:20.960]   steaming pile of manure white.
[02:08:20.960 --> 02:08:22.480]   It's still stinking pile of manure.
[02:08:22.480 --> 02:08:25.280]   And the whitewash ain't working.
[02:08:25.280 --> 02:08:27.280]   And so we pretty much even CNN is
[02:08:27.280 --> 02:08:28.240]   acting like they've already got
[02:08:28.240 --> 02:08:30.560]   a pre-copy of it, saying, okay,
[02:08:30.560 --> 02:08:31.760]   it shows they told witnesses what
[02:08:31.760 --> 02:08:32.880]   was coming up with Congress.
[02:08:32.880 --> 02:08:34.880]   And they told people who was going
[02:08:34.880 --> 02:08:35.760]   to be subpoenaed.
[02:08:35.760 --> 02:08:36.800]   And they told people what was
[02:08:36.800 --> 02:08:38.160]   happening and they did a fake
[02:08:38.160 --> 02:08:39.360]   investigation of Hillary.
[02:08:39.360 --> 02:08:41.280]   It's bombshell, but it kind of
[02:08:41.280 --> 02:08:45.520]   couches it in placid terms.
[02:08:45.520 --> 02:08:48.080]   So we're going to be looking at
[02:08:48.080 --> 02:08:49.840]   that as soon as it comes out
[02:08:49.840 --> 02:08:52.560]   in T minus 52 minutes.
[02:08:52.560 --> 02:08:53.920]   And Roger Stone will be back in
[02:08:53.920 --> 02:08:55.120]   here with me as soon as it comes
[02:08:55.120 --> 02:08:56.880]   out, we'll read the report here on
[02:08:56.880 --> 02:08:58.320]   air in the fourth hour.
[02:08:58.320 --> 02:08:59.200]   So that's coming up.
[02:08:59.200 --> 02:09:01.840]   But if you want to know why they
[02:09:01.840 --> 02:09:03.120]   really hate the American people
[02:09:03.120 --> 02:09:03.760]   and hate Trump,
[02:09:04.880 --> 02:09:05.840]   Trump was never supposed to get
[02:09:05.840 --> 02:09:06.480]   into office.
[02:09:06.480 --> 02:09:10.000]   They tried to cover up their
[02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:11.360]   illegal spying on Trump,
[02:09:11.360 --> 02:09:12.560]   turning it into Russiagate.
[02:09:12.560 --> 02:09:13.680]   They were actually trying to plant
[02:09:13.680 --> 02:09:15.680]   Russia stuff on him, but really,
[02:09:15.680 --> 02:09:17.360]   just using the fake Russia stuff
[02:09:17.360 --> 02:09:18.640]   that they've made up to spy
[02:09:18.640 --> 02:09:19.280]   on the campaign.
[02:09:19.280 --> 02:09:23.360]   So now they're being hoisted
[02:09:23.360 --> 02:09:24.400]   on their own spear.
[02:09:24.400 --> 02:09:29.200]   And now the IG report is out.
[02:09:29.200 --> 02:09:30.160]   They said it would come out at
[02:09:30.160 --> 02:09:32.080]   three o'clock Eastern,
[02:09:32.080 --> 02:09:32.960]   maybe two o'clock Central,
[02:09:32.960 --> 02:09:33.920]   but it just came out.
[02:09:33.920 --> 02:09:36.800]   So there it is, boom,
[02:09:36.800 --> 02:09:37.760]   so an hour early.
[02:09:37.760 --> 02:09:39.920]   So go ahead and print that off for
[02:09:39.920 --> 02:09:41.280]   me so we'll cover.
[02:09:41.280 --> 02:09:42.800]   Oversight, integrity, guidance.
[02:09:42.800 --> 02:09:44.240]   Well, the Office of the Inspector
[02:09:44.240 --> 02:09:45.600]   General has been showing more of
[02:09:45.600 --> 02:09:47.440]   the integrity than we've seen from
[02:09:47.440 --> 02:09:51.280]   Rosenstein and McCabe and
[02:09:51.280 --> 02:09:51.840]   these people.
[02:09:51.840 --> 02:09:53.360]   I mean, it's unbelievable.
[02:09:53.360 --> 02:09:55.120]   So that's all coming up.
[02:09:55.120 --> 02:09:56.400]   In fact, guys, let's post that
[02:09:56.400 --> 02:09:57.920]   to Infowars.com.
[02:09:57.920 --> 02:09:59.760]   Have Don Salazar, Kit, or one of
[02:09:59.760 --> 02:10:02.000]   the other, Mr. McBrain,
[02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:03.680]   McBrain's son works here.
[02:10:03.680 --> 02:10:04.880]   I normally don't let people's kids
[02:10:04.880 --> 02:10:05.840]   work in the building,
[02:10:05.840 --> 02:10:07.520]   but so many of them are so good,
[02:10:07.520 --> 02:10:08.880]   like Travis Knight's so awesome.
[02:10:08.880 --> 02:10:09.920]   He works here, David Knight's his
[02:10:09.920 --> 02:10:12.080]   dad, Kellan McBrain works here,
[02:10:12.080 --> 02:10:12.800]   one of the guys.
[02:10:12.800 --> 02:10:13.680]   When you get him to post that,
[02:10:13.680 --> 02:10:14.880]   or whoever can post it,
[02:10:14.880 --> 02:10:16.560]   Infowars.com, but we'll see
[02:10:16.560 --> 02:10:19.440]   exactly what all is in there,
[02:10:19.440 --> 02:10:20.560]   though people have already seen it
[02:10:20.560 --> 02:10:22.240]   and basically broke it down.
[02:10:22.240 --> 02:10:25.360]   Also, NHS picking up the pieces
[02:10:25.360 --> 02:10:27.040]   of mental illness epidemic
[02:10:27.040 --> 02:10:28.640]   caused by social media.
[02:10:28.640 --> 02:10:29.440]   Well, in Telegraph,
[02:10:29.440 --> 02:10:30.400]   how many years ago did we tell you
[02:10:30.400 --> 02:10:31.520]   that it's designed to make you
[02:10:31.520 --> 02:10:32.080]   mentally ill?
[02:10:33.760 --> 02:10:34.720]   We're going to break it all down,
[02:10:34.720 --> 02:10:36.400]   but I thought I would play this
[02:10:36.400 --> 02:10:37.600]   because they hate it.
[02:10:37.600 --> 02:10:40.560]   Remember, it's all confirmed.
[02:10:40.560 --> 02:10:42.480]   You've got Clapper and Brennan on
[02:10:42.480 --> 02:10:44.160]   TV saying, okay, we spied on Trump.
[02:10:44.160 --> 02:10:45.120]   But it's for his own good.
[02:10:45.120 --> 02:10:46.960]   You've got Bill Maher saying,
[02:10:46.960 --> 02:10:48.080]   we didn't spy on you,
[02:10:48.080 --> 02:10:49.280]   we just surveilled you because
[02:10:49.280 --> 02:10:50.400]   you're a damn Russian.
[02:10:50.400 --> 02:10:51.680]   Remember, that was a week ago.
[02:10:51.680 --> 02:10:53.520]   So they're really having to spin
[02:10:53.520 --> 02:10:55.440]   all this after all these years
[02:10:55.440 --> 02:10:56.480]   saying we're insane.
[02:10:56.480 --> 02:10:59.520]   Well, the truth is Clapper and
[02:10:59.520 --> 02:11:03.200]   Brennan and Schumer shot their
[02:11:03.200 --> 02:11:05.280]   mouths off and said,
[02:11:05.280 --> 02:11:06.640]   we've got intelligence on Trump.
[02:11:06.640 --> 02:11:08.400]   He will never even get inaugurated.
[02:11:08.400 --> 02:11:09.440]   He's out of here.
[02:11:09.440 --> 02:11:13.520]   So now The Hill can report,
[02:11:13.520 --> 02:11:14.800]   we told you two years ago,
[02:11:14.800 --> 02:11:16.560]   latest scandal revelations raised
[02:11:16.560 --> 02:11:18.800]   questions on Obama agency's roles.
[02:11:18.800 --> 02:11:20.160]   Yeah, we told you Trump was being
[02:11:20.160 --> 02:11:23.920]   spied on before he was even elected.
[02:11:23.920 --> 02:11:25.840]   Because we have the information,
[02:11:25.840 --> 02:11:26.800]   we have the research,
[02:11:26.800 --> 02:11:28.080]   we are ahead of the curve.
[02:11:28.080 --> 02:11:28.880]   That's what we do.
[02:11:29.520 --> 02:11:30.480]   We set the agenda.
[02:11:30.480 --> 02:11:32.240]   We're history's actors now.
[02:11:32.240 --> 02:11:33.680]   We want the people to be history's
[02:11:33.680 --> 02:11:37.120]   actors, leaky, sneaky, and freaky.
[02:11:37.120 --> 02:11:39.600]   One's a little hobbyist.
[02:11:39.600 --> 02:11:44.240]   The other two are just total lying,
[02:11:44.240 --> 02:11:46.000]   obfuscating, arrogant.
[02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:47.520]   I mean, take Brennan telling Trump,
[02:11:47.520 --> 02:11:50.480]   two days before he is inaugurated,
[02:11:50.480 --> 02:11:56.160]   watch your mouth on CNN.
[02:11:57.440 --> 02:11:58.800]   The head of the CIA, and then when
[02:11:58.800 --> 02:12:00.240]   Trump fired him three days later,
[02:12:00.240 --> 02:12:04.480]   he said, I can't believe I've been fired.
[02:12:04.480 --> 02:12:06.080]   You're a megalomaniac,
[02:12:06.080 --> 02:12:07.440]   delusional fruitcake.
[02:12:07.440 --> 02:12:11.360]   I've had a few former crew members
[02:12:11.360 --> 02:12:12.640]   that over the years got arrogant or
[02:12:12.640 --> 02:12:14.160]   whatever, and I'd say they're fired,
[02:12:14.160 --> 02:12:14.960]   or you can't fire me,
[02:12:14.960 --> 02:12:16.240]   this isn't really happening.
[02:12:16.240 --> 02:12:17.520]   I'm like, listen, don't let the door
[02:12:17.520 --> 02:12:18.720]   hit you on your old rear end.
[02:12:18.720 --> 02:12:20.320]   It's the same, or you've ever had
[02:12:20.320 --> 02:12:21.280]   one of your teenagers,
[02:12:21.280 --> 02:12:22.320]   they got pretty good kids.
[02:12:22.320 --> 02:12:23.360]   So don't think a little smart mouth.
[02:12:25.360 --> 02:12:26.800]   You're not going to really not let
[02:12:26.800 --> 02:12:27.760]   me go to that concert.
[02:12:27.760 --> 02:12:29.120]   You're not going to really not let
[02:12:29.120 --> 02:12:30.240]   me go to my friend's house for
[02:12:30.240 --> 02:12:31.280]   the movies.
[02:12:31.280 --> 02:12:32.080]   I'm like, yeah,
[02:12:32.080 --> 02:12:33.200]   get your butt in your room.
[02:12:33.200 --> 02:12:36.240]   And the next day they apologize,
[02:12:36.240 --> 02:12:38.240]   but those are children,
[02:12:38.240 --> 02:12:40.560]   these are adults doing this.
[02:12:40.560 --> 02:12:41.920]   So here's why they hate us,
[02:12:41.920 --> 02:12:43.120]   ladies and gentlemen,
[02:12:43.120 --> 02:12:44.320]   because we're right.
[02:12:44.320 --> 02:12:45.760]   They have egg all over their face
[02:12:45.760 --> 02:12:47.120]   on every front, here it is.
[02:12:47.120 --> 02:12:49.840]   >> And now Republicans,
[02:12:49.840 --> 02:12:51.840]   you're the Alex Jones party.
[02:12:51.840 --> 02:12:53.680]   There is literally nothing too
[02:12:53.680 --> 02:12:55.840]   stupid and conspiratorial that you
[02:12:55.840 --> 02:12:57.040]   will not swallow.
[02:12:57.040 --> 02:12:58.400]   Some tweeted, terrible,
[02:12:58.400 --> 02:13:00.160]   just found out that Obama had my
[02:13:00.160 --> 02:13:02.560]   wires tapped in Trump Tower just
[02:13:02.560 --> 02:13:03.840]   before the victory.
[02:13:03.840 --> 02:13:05.600]   Nothing found, this is McCarthyism.
[02:13:05.600 --> 02:13:06.960]   And the other one, how low has
[02:13:06.960 --> 02:13:08.640]   President Obama gone to tap my
[02:13:08.640 --> 02:13:10.000]   phones during the very
[02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:11.440]   sacred election process?
[02:13:11.440 --> 02:13:12.720]   >> And this weekend we saw another
[02:13:12.720 --> 02:13:14.080]   example of that when White House
[02:13:14.080 --> 02:13:15.440]   Counselor Kellyanne Conway was
[02:13:15.440 --> 02:13:17.200]   asked if she had any proof for
[02:13:17.200 --> 02:13:18.720]   Trump's outlandish claim that
[02:13:18.720 --> 02:13:20.080]   Obama wiretapped him during
[02:13:20.080 --> 02:13:20.720]   the campaign and
[02:13:20.720 --> 02:13:22.480]   offered this bizarre answer.
[02:13:22.480 --> 02:13:24.480]   >> How does he know that his phone
[02:13:24.480 --> 02:13:26.080]   was actually tapped?
[02:13:26.080 --> 02:13:27.920]   >> Let me answer that globally.
[02:13:27.920 --> 02:13:28.640]   He's the President of
[02:13:28.640 --> 02:13:29.360]   the United States.
[02:13:29.360 --> 02:13:30.640]   He has information and
[02:13:30.640 --> 02:13:32.000]   intelligence that the rest of us
[02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:32.640]   do not.

[02:13:34.400 --> 02:13:36.160]   enlisted a foreign intelligence

[02:13:37.760 --> 02:13:38.480]   adversary.
[02:13:38.480 --> 02:13:40.000]   That is an explosive charge.
[02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:41.280]   >> This is a serious allegation.
[02:13:41.280 --> 02:13:43.200]   This might be the most serious
[02:13:43.200 --> 02:13:45.360]   allegation any president has made
[02:13:45.360 --> 02:13:47.280]   against a previous president.
[02:13:47.280 --> 02:13:48.320]   >> But this is a very serious

[02:13:51.360 --> 02:13:52.960]   >> The craziest thing about Trump
[02:13:52.960 --> 02:13:54.240]   calling for an investigation
[02:13:54.240 --> 02:13:56.800]   without any evidence, zero evidence.
[02:13:56.800 --> 02:13:58.240]   Trump has not produced a shred
[02:13:58.240 --> 02:13:58.800]   of evidence.
[02:13:58.800 --> 02:13:59.760]   >> There was no evidence for

[02:14:00.480 --> 02:14:02.480]   >> The evidence did not come.
[02:14:02.480 --> 02:14:04.160]   >> So where did Trump get his info?
[02:14:04.160 --> 02:14:05.440]   From the CIA?
[02:14:05.440 --> 02:14:06.480]   From the FBI?
[02:14:06.480 --> 02:14:07.520]   >> Where are you getting this

[02:14:12.480 --> 02:14:14.320]   >> Info Wars, it's a radio show
[02:14:14.320 --> 02:14:15.600]   hosted by Alex Jones.
[02:14:15.600 --> 02:14:16.320]   >> [LAUGH]
[02:14:16.320 --> 02:14:17.600]   >> You know he's legit.
[02:14:17.600 --> 02:14:19.200]   >> This bizarre circular thing
[02:14:19.200 --> 02:14:20.560]   happening where the President
[02:14:20.560 --> 02:14:22.400]   cites a theory that he was
[02:14:22.400 --> 02:14:23.840]   wiretapped, which developed on
[02:14:23.840 --> 02:14:25.360]   the kind of fringe right-wing
[02:14:25.360 --> 02:14:26.160]   media.
[02:14:26.160 --> 02:14:28.240]   And then after his tweet storm,
[02:14:28.240 --> 02:14:29.440]   Info Wars then started saying,
[02:14:29.440 --> 02:14:30.320]   well, look, it was the New York
[02:14:30.320 --> 02:14:31.520]   Times that reported it, citing
[02:14:31.520 --> 02:14:33.920]   our story, misreading our story.
[02:14:33.920 --> 02:14:35.440]   And now a few weeks later,
[02:14:35.440 --> 02:14:36.880]   the White House and the President
[02:14:36.880 --> 02:14:39.360]   are citing Info Wars.
[02:14:39.360 --> 02:14:41.120]   So they've got one kind of bizarre
[02:14:41.120 --> 02:14:42.400]   right-wing fringe theory to defend
[02:14:42.400 --> 02:14:43.600]   another bizarre right-wing
[02:14:43.600 --> 02:14:44.560]   fringe theory.
[02:14:44.560 --> 02:14:46.400]   >> The crazier it gets,
[02:14:46.400 --> 02:14:48.080]   the more they like it.
[02:14:48.080 --> 02:14:49.200]   That's their jam.
[02:14:49.200 --> 02:14:51.760]   >> No, we're not under your mind
[02:14:51.760 --> 02:14:52.720]   control.
[02:14:52.720 --> 02:14:54.560]   See, if I was Stormtroopers, and
[02:14:54.560 --> 02:14:56.320]   Obi-Wan Kenobi, and the droids
[02:14:56.320 --> 02:14:58.080]   came by, and they're the exact
[02:14:58.080 --> 02:15:00.000]   ones I'm looking for, and he says
[02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:01.760]   these aren't the droids you're
[02:15:01.760 --> 02:15:03.280]   looking for, I blast him.
[02:15:03.280 --> 02:15:04.720]   See, that didn't work on me.
[02:15:04.720 --> 02:15:06.160]   I'm like Jabba the Hutt.
[02:15:06.160 --> 02:15:08.080]   Jedi mind tricks don't work on me.
[02:15:08.080 --> 02:15:10.480]   Teeny Jedi.
[02:15:10.480 --> 02:15:11.840]   They were all over the news
[02:15:11.840 --> 02:15:13.600]   salivating to their criminals and
[02:15:13.600 --> 02:15:15.360]   government going, don't worry,
[02:15:15.360 --> 02:15:16.720]   Trump will never get in.
[02:15:16.720 --> 02:15:18.080]   We were spying on him, and
[02:15:18.080 --> 02:15:19.840]   Obama is delivering all the data to
[02:15:19.840 --> 02:15:21.520]   other agencies to stay behind and
[02:15:21.520 --> 02:15:23.280]   stop him even if he gets in.
[02:15:23.280 --> 02:15:24.480]   And I'm like, my God,
[02:15:24.480 --> 02:15:25.760]   they're admitting.
[02:15:25.760 --> 02:15:27.040]   Yeah, back that up.
[02:15:27.040 --> 02:15:27.960]   Let's go to break with this.
[02:15:27.960 --> 02:15:30.880]   They admitted my source is them.
[02:15:30.880 --> 02:15:31.920]   And then they tried this game of,
[02:15:31.920 --> 02:15:32.800]   well, you didn't really see
[02:15:32.800 --> 02:15:33.840]   the cover of the New York Times
[02:15:33.840 --> 02:15:35.280]   that said that, though it did.

[02:15:36.280 --> 02:15:37.200]   Here it is, here it is.

[02:19:11.520 --> 02:19:12.960]   It's made in the USA.
[02:19:12.960 --> 02:19:14.680]   It's filled with known compounds
[02:19:14.680 --> 02:19:16.400]   from nature that are absolutely
[02:19:16.400 --> 02:19:18.120]   associated with detoxifying the
[02:19:18.120 --> 02:19:20.000]   body and it supports the InfoWars.
[02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:21.920]   It is a classical 360 win.
[02:19:21.920 --> 02:19:23.360]   This is the formula that I
[02:19:23.360 --> 02:19:25.120]   personally have been taking for
[02:19:25.120 --> 02:19:26.960]   over a year, and now we believe we
[02:19:26.960 --> 02:19:28.720]   have come as close to perfection
[02:19:28.720 --> 02:19:30.400]   when it comes to a detoxifier as
[02:19:30.400 --> 02:19:31.640]   you can possibly get.
[02:19:31.640 --> 02:19:32.800]   You owe it to yourself,
[02:19:32.800 --> 02:19:34.240]   you owe it to your family, and
[02:19:34.240 --> 02:19:35.720]   you owe it to the future of this
[02:19:35.720 --> 02:19:37.480]   country and the world that patriots
[02:19:37.480 --> 02:19:39.120]   stay as healthy and as clean and
[02:19:39.120 --> 02:19:40.480]   as focused as you can be.
[02:19:40.480 --> 02:19:41.760]   Because we need you,
[02:19:41.760 --> 02:19:43.200]   the remnant of America,
[02:19:43.200 --> 02:19:45.000]   to reignite those brush fires to
[02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:46.720]   the next level and to be healthy
[02:19:46.720 --> 02:19:48.320]   and as focused as you can be.
[02:19:48.320 --> 02:19:49.520]   Thanks to your support and
[02:19:49.520 --> 02:19:50.640]   your prayers, together,
[02:19:50.640 --> 02:19:51.800]   we're changing the world.
[02:19:51.800 --> 02:19:53.520]   Now it's time to change our bodies
[02:19:53.520 --> 02:19:55.520]   with Z-Shield and InfoWarsLife.com.

[02:20:53.480 --> 02:20:54.720]   coming up the next hour,
[02:20:54.720 --> 02:20:56.320]   we've got the full AG report,
[02:20:56.320 --> 02:20:58.160]   it's posted to NewsWars.com and
[02:20:58.160 --> 02:21:00.240]   InfoWars.com.
[02:21:00.240 --> 02:21:01.480]   And it is a doozy,
[02:21:01.480 --> 02:21:03.600]   we're scanning over it.
[02:21:03.600 --> 02:21:05.560]   It already been leaked out to
[02:21:05.560 --> 02:21:07.320]   Judicial Watch and CNN.
[02:21:07.320 --> 02:21:08.880]   And we're going to be going over
[02:21:08.880 --> 02:21:09.440]   all of it.
[02:21:09.440 --> 02:21:10.840]   And it's pretty much what we
[02:21:10.840 --> 02:21:12.200]   thought it was going to be.
[02:21:12.200 --> 02:21:15.200]   But it's bombshell, but
[02:21:15.200 --> 02:21:18.960]   it's couched in basically,
[02:21:18.960 --> 02:21:21.280]   sophistic terms.
[02:21:21.280 --> 02:21:22.640]   And we'll get more into it later
[02:21:22.640 --> 02:21:24.040]   in the hour as well.
[02:21:24.040 --> 02:21:26.360]   But Comey's actions in the Clinton
[02:21:26.360 --> 02:21:28.240]   case departed clearly and
[02:21:28.240 --> 02:21:29.960]   dramatically from FBI department
[02:21:29.960 --> 02:21:30.480]   norms.
[02:21:30.480 --> 02:21:33.080]   That's a nice way of saying it was
[02:21:33.080 --> 02:21:34.520]   illegal, and colluded, and
[02:21:34.520 --> 02:21:36.080]   hurt the perception of the FBI.
[02:21:36.080 --> 02:21:37.760]   But they weren't the result of
[02:21:37.760 --> 02:21:40.000]   political bias, total horsemaneer.
[02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.960]   Specifically, it was not Comey's
[02:21:42.960 --> 02:21:44.360]   job to publicly proclaim what
[02:21:44.360 --> 02:21:46.000]   a reasonable prosecutor should do
[02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:47.040]   in the Clinton case.
[02:21:47.040 --> 02:21:48.560]   Tied between a fair having FBI
[02:21:48.560 --> 02:21:49.920]   officials Peter Strzok and
[02:21:49.920 --> 02:21:52.080]   Lisa Page did have political bias.
[02:21:52.080 --> 02:21:53.560]   But the AG found evidence that
[02:21:53.560 --> 02:21:55.280]   improper considerations affected
[02:21:55.280 --> 02:21:56.480]   their investigative actions.
[02:21:56.480 --> 02:21:57.240]   That's right.
[02:21:57.240 --> 02:21:59.160]   They're all just getting paid by
[02:21:59.160 --> 02:22:01.000]   their bosses to set up the whole
[02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:02.760]   fake report and do all that.
[02:22:02.760 --> 02:22:04.560]   And it just goes on from there.
[02:22:04.560 --> 02:22:10.440]   So, these are all just the white
[02:22:10.440 --> 02:22:11.400]   washes going on.
[02:22:11.400 --> 02:22:12.560]   But more is coming out,
[02:22:12.560 --> 02:22:13.720]   ladies and gentlemen.
[02:22:13.720 --> 02:22:14.360]   Now, Dr.
[02:22:14.360 --> 02:22:17.080]   Sheba is a scientist, inventor,
[02:22:17.080 --> 02:22:18.760]   inventor of email.
[02:22:18.760 --> 02:22:20.960]   He forgot the title of that,
[02:22:20.960 --> 02:22:22.000]   literally.
[02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:23.560]   He's the guy who put the term
[02:22:23.560 --> 02:22:24.120]   email and
[02:22:24.120 --> 02:22:25.880]   codified into that system.
[02:22:25.880 --> 02:22:27.400]   And he is running against
[02:22:27.400 --> 02:22:28.640]   Elizabeth Warren,
[02:22:28.640 --> 02:22:30.840]   who will not do the genetic test.
[02:22:30.840 --> 02:22:32.760]   The tribes say she has no
[02:22:32.760 --> 02:22:35.000]   connection to in Oklahoma or
[02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:36.240]   other areas.
[02:22:36.240 --> 02:22:38.320]   But he's a real Indian from
[02:22:38.320 --> 02:22:40.560]   the subcontinent India.
[02:22:40.560 --> 02:22:42.080]   But he's a great patriot.
[02:22:42.080 --> 02:22:43.480]   I'd love to get him in the US
[02:22:43.480 --> 02:22:44.000]   Senate.
[02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:45.680]   But regardless, he is reaching
[02:22:45.680 --> 02:22:47.240]   tens of millions of people in
[02:22:47.240 --> 02:22:48.840]   the interviews he's doing and
[02:22:48.840 --> 02:22:49.840]   what he's doing.
[02:22:49.840 --> 02:22:51.200]   But boy, they've been censoring
[02:22:51.200 --> 02:22:52.440]   him saying he can't put up his
[02:22:52.440 --> 02:22:53.920]   political signs, even if he pays
[02:22:53.920 --> 02:22:57.080]   for it, it's getting crazy.
[02:22:57.080 --> 02:22:58.440]   So we're part of the 34 hour
[02:22:58.440 --> 02:22:59.960]   broadcast right now going to him
[02:22:59.960 --> 02:23:01.440]   to cover what he's been doing,
[02:23:01.440 --> 02:23:02.640]   what's been happening.
[02:23:02.640 --> 02:23:03.920]   But then expanding,
[02:23:03.920 --> 02:23:05.720]   he's a smart guy on some great
[02:23:05.720 --> 02:23:07.360]   technology ideas he has.
[02:23:07.360 --> 02:23:10.120]   And then the blue wave turning
[02:23:10.120 --> 02:23:12.880]   into a blue backwash of toilet
[02:23:12.880 --> 02:23:14.240]   bowl cleaner.
[02:23:14.240 --> 02:23:16.520]   And then you've got the red
[02:23:16.520 --> 02:23:19.260]   tsunami now with all these anti
[02:23:19.260 --> 02:23:22.320]   Trump Republicans being swept out
[02:23:22.320 --> 02:23:24.480]   in special elections.
[02:23:24.480 --> 02:23:26.920]   We're going to look at all that.
[02:23:26.920 --> 02:23:28.920]   What are they going to do if
[02:23:28.920 --> 02:23:31.160]   the trends of the Civil War,
[02:23:31.160 --> 02:23:33.280]   that when a Republican has
[02:23:33.280 --> 02:23:36.040]   the presidency after his first two
[02:23:36.040 --> 02:23:38.800]   years, the Democrats take control
[02:23:38.800 --> 02:23:41.240]   of the House or Senate or both.
[02:23:41.240 --> 02:23:42.600]   Because all the evidence is
[02:23:42.600 --> 02:23:43.840]   pointing towards that not
[02:23:43.840 --> 02:23:45.480]   happening, but remember they got
[02:23:45.480 --> 02:23:46.800]   an old ace up the sleeve and
[02:23:46.800 --> 02:23:48.400]   a couple other cards, five or
[02:23:48.400 --> 02:23:49.040]   six aces.
[02:23:49.040 --> 02:23:50.880]   So they're going to try to steal
[02:23:50.880 --> 02:23:52.880]   the election as they've already
[02:23:52.880 --> 02:23:53.400]   done.
[02:23:53.400 --> 02:23:55.360]   But Dr. Sheba Ayodhya Ray,
[02:23:55.360 --> 02:23:57.560]   thanks for joining us with some
[02:23:57.560 --> 02:23:59.760]   big breaking exclusive news.
[02:23:59.760 --> 02:24:02.120]   >> Yeah, great to be here, Alex.
[02:24:02.120 --> 02:24:03.320]   I think I may just hit my camera.
[02:24:03.320 --> 02:24:03.880]   How are you?
[02:24:03.880 --> 02:24:04.600]   >> I'm good, man.
[02:24:04.600 --> 02:24:06.200]   It's good to see your smiling face
[02:24:06.200 --> 02:24:06.640]   there.
[02:24:06.640 --> 02:24:07.800]   Where do you want to start?
[02:24:07.800 --> 02:24:09.160]   The blue wave turning into
[02:24:09.160 --> 02:24:11.000]   a fizzle, your big announcement,
[02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:12.760]   the censorship you're facing,
[02:24:12.760 --> 02:24:13.560]   North Korea,
[02:24:13.560 --> 02:24:15.040]   there's so much to cover.
[02:24:15.040 --> 02:24:16.200]   >> We can start anywhere because
[02:24:16.200 --> 02:24:17.760]   they're all interconnected, right?
[02:24:17.760 --> 02:24:18.560]   You touch one part,
[02:24:18.560 --> 02:24:19.920]   it connects to everything else.
[02:24:19.920 --> 02:24:21.040]   Maybe we should just start with
[02:24:21.040 --> 02:24:22.080]   the free speech thing, Alex.
[02:24:22.080 --> 02:24:22.640]   >> Yes.
[02:24:22.640 --> 02:24:24.040]   >> because that's where we left
[02:24:24.040 --> 02:24:24.800]   off last time.
[02:24:24.800 --> 02:24:26.400]   Last time we were on, Alex,
[02:24:26.400 --> 02:24:27.720]   we shared with you and
[02:24:27.720 --> 02:24:29.800]   your audience that we got this big
[02:24:29.800 --> 02:24:31.680]   sign out here, you may see it,
[02:24:31.680 --> 02:24:33.560]   only the real Indian can defeat
[02:24:33.560 --> 02:24:34.640]   the fake Indian.
[02:24:34.640 --> 02:24:36.680]   It's a very powerful meme, Alex,
[02:24:36.680 --> 02:24:38.520]   and I want to really explain why
[02:24:38.520 --> 02:24:39.720]   it's so powerful and
[02:24:39.720 --> 02:24:41.160]   why we put it out there.
[02:24:41.160 --> 02:24:43.160]   Because it really is an expression
[02:24:43.160 --> 02:24:44.560]   of not only my anger, but
[02:24:44.560 --> 02:24:46.360]   pretty much everyone's anger at
[02:24:46.360 --> 02:24:48.040]   the corruption that is taking
[02:24:48.040 --> 02:24:49.280]   place in government.
[02:24:49.280 --> 02:24:50.600]   Elizabeth Warren is a face of
[02:24:50.600 --> 02:24:51.440]   that corruption.
[02:24:51.440 --> 02:24:53.200]   So when we put that signage up on
[02:24:53.200 --> 02:24:55.080]   our bus, the city of Cambridge,
[02:24:55.080 --> 02:24:56.840]   which is supposed to be the most
[02:24:56.840 --> 02:24:58.560]   liberal haven on the planet,
[02:24:58.560 --> 02:25:00.200]   said we had to take it down.
[02:25:00.200 --> 02:25:02.000]   That was on April 5th, 2018.
[02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:02.720]   We didn't do that.
[02:25:02.720 --> 02:25:04.480]   In fact, we retaliated hard and
[02:25:04.480 --> 02:25:05.320]   we sued them,
[02:25:05.320 --> 02:25:07.080]   took them to federal court and
[02:25:07.080 --> 02:25:07.640]   we won.
[02:25:07.640 --> 02:25:10.200]   They surrendered completely and
[02:25:10.200 --> 02:25:11.800]   then based on that,
[02:25:11.800 --> 02:25:14.120]   we dismissed the court case.
[02:25:14.120 --> 02:25:16.120]   Obviously, the mainstream media
[02:25:16.120 --> 02:25:18.360]   did not want to cover our victory.
[02:25:18.360 --> 02:25:19.920]   So what we realize, Alex,
[02:25:19.920 --> 02:25:21.360]   the big news is this, and
[02:25:21.360 --> 02:25:23.400]   this is something that's really,
[02:25:23.400 --> 02:25:24.600]   really important.
[02:25:24.600 --> 02:25:26.440]   You see, for far too long,
[02:25:26.440 --> 02:25:28.960]   the establishment has made politics
[02:25:28.960 --> 02:25:31.240]   essentially an audience sport,
[02:25:31.240 --> 02:25:31.840]   right?
[02:25:31.840 --> 02:25:33.760]   They do not want the everyday
[02:25:33.760 --> 02:25:36.360]   citizen to actually be involved in
[02:25:36.360 --> 02:25:37.960]   that aspect, right?
[02:25:37.960 --> 02:25:38.960]   because they don't want to give
[02:25:38.960 --> 02:25:39.720]   power back to the people.
[02:25:39.720 --> 02:25:40.440]   >> They don't want people in
[02:25:40.440 --> 02:25:40.960]   the arena.
[02:25:40.960 --> 02:25:42.080]   >> They don't want people in
[02:25:42.080 --> 02:25:42.640]   the arena.
[02:25:42.640 --> 02:25:43.920]   They want to make it the old
[02:25:43.920 --> 02:25:45.480]   Hollywood celebrity culture.
[02:25:45.480 --> 02:25:46.760]   You put a couple of people on
[02:25:46.760 --> 02:25:47.440]   pedestals and
[02:25:47.440 --> 02:25:49.000]   we're supposed to watch them and
[02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:50.720]   eat our popcorn.
[02:25:50.720 --> 02:25:52.040]   So what we've done here, Alex,
[02:25:52.040 --> 02:25:53.560]   is that's becoming really powerful
[02:25:53.560 --> 02:25:54.720]   is we figured out the victory
[02:25:54.720 --> 02:25:55.560]   to winning.
[02:25:55.560 --> 02:25:57.560]   And that aha moment came,
[02:25:57.560 --> 02:25:59.840]   every time we take the bus out,
[02:25:59.840 --> 02:26:01.800]   Alex, people just love our
[02:26:01.800 --> 02:26:02.720]   campaign.
[02:26:02.720 --> 02:26:04.160]   You guys can see, I think,
[02:26:04.160 --> 02:26:05.720]   several months ago in the St.
[02:26:05.720 --> 02:26:07.000]   Patrick's Day parade,
[02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:08.600]   millions saw us, millions of
[02:26:08.600 --> 02:26:10.120]   people are cheering us on.
[02:26:10.120 --> 02:26:11.800]   We went to the Bunker Hill Day
[02:26:11.800 --> 02:26:13.560]   parade recently with the bus.
[02:26:13.560 --> 02:26:15.400]   And what happened was this is
[02:26:15.400 --> 02:26:17.720]   an enclave of both, quote unquote,
[02:26:17.720 --> 02:26:19.880]   liberals and working class people
[02:26:19.880 --> 02:26:22.040]   unanimously, except for probably
[02:26:22.040 --> 02:26:23.240]   5% of the people,
[02:26:23.240 --> 02:26:24.760]   people loved that slogan.
[02:26:24.760 --> 02:26:26.120]   I mean, talk about market focus
[02:26:26.120 --> 02:26:26.640]   groups.
[02:26:26.640 --> 02:26:28.520]   And what we realized was people
[02:26:28.520 --> 02:26:30.000]   say, you know what, you guys have
[02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:31.440]   a lot of courage to put that out
[02:26:31.440 --> 02:26:33.040]   there because you're bringing out
[02:26:33.040 --> 02:26:34.600]   something in Massachusetts that
[02:26:34.600 --> 02:26:37.200]   people do not want to talk about.
[02:26:37.200 --> 02:26:38.880]   So the bus is essentially,
[02:26:38.880 --> 02:26:40.080]   it's weaponized.
[02:26:40.080 --> 02:26:41.760]   It's a weaponized way of getting
[02:26:41.760 --> 02:26:42.960]   across our message.
[02:26:42.960 --> 02:26:44.520]   So what we've done is if you see
[02:26:44.520 --> 02:26:45.960]   these magnetic signs here,
[02:26:45.960 --> 02:26:47.400]   they're really easy.
[02:26:47.400 --> 02:26:49.320]   So we want to replicate this all
[02:26:49.320 --> 02:26:51.240]   over the state, Alex, in fact,
[02:26:51.240 --> 02:26:52.720]   all over the country.
[02:26:52.720 --> 02:26:54.040]   And basically, people can buy
[02:26:54.040 --> 02:26:55.560]   these magnetic signs, you can see
[02:26:55.560 --> 02:26:57.360]   as you're showing, being put on.
[02:26:57.360 --> 02:26:58.960]   And where since we launched,
[02:26:58.960 --> 02:27:00.760]   we have tons of people starting to
[02:27:00.760 --> 02:27:02.400]   write and wanting these, and
[02:27:02.400 --> 02:27:04.160]   why is that?
[02:27:04.160 --> 02:27:05.280]   And the reality is when
[02:27:05.280 --> 02:27:06.200]   Elizabeth Warren,
[02:27:06.200 --> 02:27:07.840]   it's not about identity, right?
[02:27:07.840 --> 02:27:09.320]   The liberals want to convert it to
[02:27:09.320 --> 02:27:10.160]   a race issue, but
[02:27:10.160 --> 02:27:11.560]   it has nothing to do with race.
[02:27:11.560 --> 02:27:13.360]   It has to do with integrity.
[02:27:13.360 --> 02:27:15.080]   We're talking about someone who
[02:27:15.080 --> 02:27:17.240]   did not work hard, who cut in line.
[02:27:17.240 --> 02:27:18.880]   You, me, Alex, and pretty much
[02:27:18.880 --> 02:27:20.600]   every American watching your show
[02:27:20.600 --> 02:27:21.640]   works for a living.
[02:27:21.640 --> 02:27:23.160]   I mowed lawns as a kid,
[02:27:23.160 --> 02:27:25.200]   learned to engineer software as
[02:27:25.200 --> 02:27:27.120]   a kid, as a 14-year-old kid,
[02:27:27.120 --> 02:27:29.120]   have been working all my life.
[02:27:29.120 --> 02:27:30.600]   But Elizabeth Warren cut in front
[02:27:30.600 --> 02:27:31.160]   of line, and
[02:27:31.160 --> 02:27:32.720]   they do not want to discuss that.
[02:27:32.720 --> 02:27:34.880]   The one out of 100 who do not like
[02:27:34.880 --> 02:27:37.160]   our signage are the vocal minority
[02:27:37.160 --> 02:27:39.520]   of what I call white liberal racists
[02:27:39.520 --> 02:27:41.560]   or liberal racists right now.
[02:27:41.560 --> 02:27:42.120]   >> Exactly, and
[02:27:42.120 --> 02:27:43.120]   we'll talk about this more when we
[02:27:43.120 --> 02:27:44.640]   get back, this is so important.
[02:27:44.640 --> 02:27:46.120]   It's like Rachel Dozell saying
[02:27:46.120 --> 02:27:47.680]   she's African American when she
[02:27:47.680 --> 02:27:49.080]   doesn't have one drop of black
[02:27:49.080 --> 02:27:49.760]   blood in her.
[02:27:49.760 --> 02:27:51.320]   She goes and puts creams on,
[02:27:51.320 --> 02:27:52.560]   frizzes her hair out,
[02:27:52.560 --> 02:27:54.360]   makes her kid look like the kid's
[02:27:54.360 --> 02:27:54.880]   black.
[02:27:54.880 --> 02:27:56.760]   These people are sick because
[02:27:56.760 --> 02:27:59.200]   they're the ones pushing this whole,
[02:27:59.200 --> 02:28:01.360]   really a new caste system where if
[02:28:01.360 --> 02:28:03.240]   you're one of these protected
[02:28:03.240 --> 02:28:05.000]   groups, you're better than
[02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:05.800]   everybody.
[02:28:05.800 --> 02:28:07.040]   So I want to specifically talk
[02:28:07.040 --> 02:28:07.960]   about that, but yeah,
[02:28:07.960 --> 02:28:09.520]   Warren is a fraud, please continue.
[02:28:09.520 --> 02:28:11.520]   >> Yes, so we are bringing up not
[02:28:11.520 --> 02:28:13.600]   just the race issue because for
[02:28:13.600 --> 02:28:15.600]   far too long down the street as
[02:28:15.600 --> 02:28:17.680]   Harvard University, the white
[02:28:17.680 --> 02:28:19.680]   liberal racists who want us to
[02:28:19.680 --> 02:28:21.880]   keep us all on their reservation
[02:28:21.880 --> 02:28:23.680]   and plantation have bounded
[02:28:23.680 --> 02:28:25.840]   the discussion of race, Alex.
[02:28:25.840 --> 02:28:26.840]   And they don't know what to do
[02:28:26.840 --> 02:28:27.840]   with us because when we bring up
[02:28:27.840 --> 02:28:28.840]   that sign, they'll say, that's
[02:28:28.840 --> 02:28:30.320]   racist, we'll say really.
[02:28:30.320 --> 02:28:31.440]   And we'll flip it back and
[02:28:31.440 --> 02:28:32.760]   we say, look, you're the racist
[02:28:32.760 --> 02:28:34.120]   because you're supporting a woman
[02:28:34.120 --> 02:28:35.440]   who took advantage of race to get
[02:28:35.440 --> 02:28:37.600]   in and when she's not of that race.
[02:28:37.600 --> 02:28:39.040]   So it's an amazing discussion,
[02:28:39.040 --> 02:28:40.240]   Alex, we should come back.
[02:28:40.240 --> 02:28:41.680]   Important things we should talk
[02:28:41.680 --> 02:28:43.120]   about this, the big announcement
[02:28:43.120 --> 02:28:44.480]   is, here's an opportunity for
[02:28:44.480 --> 02:28:45.280]   every citizen.
[02:28:45.280 --> 02:28:46.120]   >> We're going to talk about
[02:28:46.120 --> 02:28:46.920]   the big announcement straight
[02:28:46.920 --> 02:28:47.680]   ahead because you've got me
[02:28:47.680 --> 02:28:48.640]   thinking your announcement is so
[02:28:48.640 --> 02:28:49.680]   smart that I've got an angle on
[02:28:49.680 --> 02:28:50.640]   this when we come back with Dr.
[02:28:50.640 --> 02:28:51.280]   Shiva, stay with us.

[02:28:57.680 --> 02:28:58.400]   bathroom.
[02:28:58.400 --> 02:29:00.160]   But where do you go when there's

[02:31:59.440 --> 02:32:01.360]   >> Years ago, Infowarslife created
[02:32:01.360 --> 02:32:03.080]   the powerful MycoZx formula to
[02:32:03.080 --> 02:32:04.840]   help you combat internal yeast.
[02:32:04.840 --> 02:32:06.200]   As the years went on and
[02:32:06.200 --> 02:32:07.880]   more toxins were pumped into
[02:32:07.880 --> 02:32:09.800]   the environment, our team knew we
[02:32:09.800 --> 02:32:11.200]   had to create a bigger and
[02:32:11.200 --> 02:32:12.880]   better formula to help support
[02:32:12.880 --> 02:32:13.880]   your gut health.
[02:32:13.880 --> 02:32:15.760]   MycoZx+ is the result of the search
[02:32:15.760 --> 02:32:17.600]   for that formula, a unique natural

[02:32:32.560 --> 02:32:34.320]   can cause you problems if it goes
[02:32:34.320 --> 02:32:34.840]   bad.

[02:33:53.120 --> 02:33:54.360]   Got a shot at winning, and
[02:33:54.360 --> 02:33:55.360]   Elizabeth Warren,
[02:33:55.360 --> 02:33:56.600]   really a smart engineer,
[02:33:56.600 --> 02:33:58.200]   very successful businessman.
[02:33:58.200 --> 02:34:00.040]   Inventor of email, look it up,
[02:34:00.040 --> 02:34:01.520]   it's true, it's crazy.
[02:34:01.520 --> 02:34:04.320]   FBI agent Strzok reportedly texted,
[02:34:04.320 --> 02:34:06.640]   we'll stop Trump from becoming
[02:34:06.640 --> 02:34:07.640]   president.
[02:34:07.640 --> 02:34:09.400]   Wow, and he's working for
[02:34:09.400 --> 02:34:11.680]   that special group under McCabe.
[02:34:12.600 --> 02:34:13.360]   And Comey,
[02:34:13.360 --> 02:34:15.560]   dedicated to fixing the intelligence.
[02:34:15.560 --> 02:34:18.840]   This is back 2015, 2016,
[02:34:18.840 --> 02:34:21.760]   spying on him to keep him from
[02:34:21.760 --> 02:34:24.280]   becoming president.
[02:34:24.280 --> 02:34:26.320]   That's a quote in the report,
[02:34:26.320 --> 02:34:28.240]   it's up on newswars.com,
[02:34:28.240 --> 02:34:29.480]   infowars.com.
[02:34:29.480 --> 02:34:31.920]   Comey broke from FBI procedures and
[02:34:31.920 --> 02:34:33.200]   Clinton probes.
[02:34:33.200 --> 02:34:34.600]   So I've scanned over this and
[02:34:34.600 --> 02:34:36.200]   so has Judicial Watch and others.
[02:34:36.200 --> 02:34:37.880]   And they're saying,
[02:34:37.880 --> 02:34:40.320]   the tone is very wishy-washy and
[02:34:40.320 --> 02:34:43.120]   Comey didn't do anything illegal,
[02:34:43.120 --> 02:34:44.920]   but they did collude and
[02:34:44.920 --> 02:34:47.520]   Comey did use his private server.
[02:34:47.520 --> 02:34:48.800]   And Strzok did it and
[02:34:48.800 --> 02:34:50.760]   they were trying to keep Trump
[02:34:50.760 --> 02:34:52.080]   from getting a dox.
[02:34:52.080 --> 02:34:54.000]   So they're basically admitting a
[02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:55.760]   lot of the horrible things that
[02:34:55.760 --> 02:34:57.300]   went on, but then saying,
[02:34:57.300 --> 02:34:58.600]   that's not illegal.
[02:34:58.600 --> 02:35:00.800]   Well, that sounds kind of criminal
[02:35:00.800 --> 02:35:02.680]   to me that they're putting out
[02:35:02.680 --> 02:35:04.800]   a report sitting in judgment like
[02:35:04.800 --> 02:35:05.840]   they're a jury.
[02:35:05.840 --> 02:35:07.760]   When clearly, FBI folks under
[02:35:07.760 --> 02:35:09.660]   the Democrats, all 13 of them
[02:35:09.660 --> 02:35:12.000]   Democrats, launching these type of
[02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.120]   operations to try to keep the now
[02:35:14.120 --> 02:35:16.200]   president from being elected,
[02:35:16.200 --> 02:35:18.040]   it just proves everything,
[02:35:18.040 --> 02:35:20.320]   regardless of the criminality and
[02:35:20.320 --> 02:35:21.480]   it's all there.
[02:35:21.480 --> 02:35:23.520]   So next hour we're going through
[02:35:23.520 --> 02:35:26.080]   this with Roger Stone in studio.
[02:35:26.080 --> 02:35:27.840]   We are now what, six, seven,
[02:35:27.840 --> 02:35:29.600]   eight hours into the 34 hour
[02:35:29.600 --> 02:35:31.600]   global broadcast we're doing.
[02:35:31.600 --> 02:35:33.120]   Fall the deep state, by the way,
[02:35:33.120 --> 02:35:34.360]   it's President Trump's.
[02:35:34.360 --> 02:35:35.600]   Should have just called this when
[02:35:35.600 --> 02:35:36.880]   I picked this date because the AG
[02:35:36.880 --> 02:35:38.200]   report was coming out to do a 34
[02:35:38.200 --> 02:35:39.660]   hour broadcast from 8 AM right
[02:35:39.660 --> 02:35:41.140]   through to the next day at 6 PM.
[02:35:41.140 --> 02:35:42.580]   And we go live 8 AM to 6 PM every
[02:35:42.580 --> 02:35:44.300]   day we're expanding the broadcast.
[02:35:44.300 --> 02:35:45.900]   We're trying to work out new hosts
[02:35:45.900 --> 02:35:46.560]   and hiring and
[02:35:46.560 --> 02:35:48.020]   the funding for that right now.
[02:35:48.020 --> 02:35:49.900]   But the fall of the deep state and
[02:35:49.900 --> 02:35:52.740]   happy birthday, Mr. President.
[02:35:52.740 --> 02:35:54.020]   We're not going to sing him happy
[02:35:54.020 --> 02:35:55.340]   birthday like Marilyn Monroe and
[02:35:55.340 --> 02:35:56.560]   I hate to gush because I'm not
[02:35:56.560 --> 02:35:57.780]   into celebrities and stuff.
[02:35:57.780 --> 02:35:59.300]   It's very freeing to not care
[02:35:59.300 --> 02:36:01.100]   about celebrities or Hollywood or
[02:36:01.100 --> 02:36:02.660]   status just for status sake.
[02:36:02.660 --> 02:36:04.660]   But Trump delivering on so
[02:36:04.660 --> 02:36:06.780]   many fronts is really almost
[02:36:06.780 --> 02:36:09.100]   messianic at this point, but
[02:36:09.100 --> 02:36:11.440]   it shows how bad the globalists
[02:36:11.440 --> 02:36:13.640]   were trying to make us poor,
[02:36:13.640 --> 02:36:15.160]   trying to divide us,
[02:36:15.160 --> 02:36:16.760]   trying to control us.
[02:36:16.760 --> 02:36:18.160]   It's in all the WikiLeaks,
[02:36:18.160 --> 02:36:19.560]   it's just they were evil.
[02:36:19.560 --> 02:36:21.080]   So it's like going to somebody's
[02:36:21.080 --> 02:36:22.600]   house, they were feeding you dog
[02:36:22.600 --> 02:36:23.880]   food with warm water on it.
[02:36:23.880 --> 02:36:24.920]   And then you went to a nice
[02:36:24.920 --> 02:36:26.460]   restaurant, you're like, my God,
[02:36:26.460 --> 02:36:27.680]   why are these enchiladas or
[02:36:27.680 --> 02:36:29.240]   why is this lasagna so delicious?
[02:36:29.240 --> 02:36:30.760]   Well, because you've been eating
[02:36:30.760 --> 02:36:31.320]   dog food.
[02:36:31.320 --> 02:36:32.760]   I mean, yeah, Trump's a great
[02:36:32.760 --> 02:36:34.160]   chef, got a lot of courage,
[02:36:34.160 --> 02:36:35.120]   got a lot done, but
[02:36:35.120 --> 02:36:37.380]   he's just reversing set garbage.
[02:36:37.380 --> 02:36:41.220]   From a very optimistic research
[02:36:41.220 --> 02:36:43.740]   perspective of a real go-getter and
[02:36:43.740 --> 02:36:45.780]   proving it with pleasure as
[02:36:45.780 --> 02:36:48.700]   a businessman like Dr. Sheba Ayodere.
[02:36:48.700 --> 02:36:49.700]   So Dr. Sheba,
[02:36:49.700 --> 02:36:52.100]   you've got a big announcement,
[02:36:52.100 --> 02:36:53.740]   it's very exciting.
[02:36:53.740 --> 02:36:55.540]   I've talked about this.
[02:36:55.540 --> 02:36:56.900]   You put an InfoWars sticker on
[02:36:56.900 --> 02:36:58.100]   your car in conservative or
[02:36:58.100 --> 02:36:59.820]   libertarian areas, you're probably
[02:36:59.820 --> 02:37:01.580]   going to get high fives all day.
[02:37:01.580 --> 02:37:03.420]   But you do it in a blue state area
[02:37:03.420 --> 02:37:05.200]   like Austin, Texas or LA or
[02:37:05.200 --> 02:37:06.260]   San Francisco,
[02:37:06.260 --> 02:37:08.040]   you might get your car keyed.
[02:37:08.040 --> 02:37:09.520]   That's why we sell t-shirts,
[02:37:09.520 --> 02:37:10.800]   they're just Moe on Lave,
[02:37:10.800 --> 02:37:12.700]   leftists can't hardly speak English,
[02:37:12.700 --> 02:37:14.200]   they don't know what Latin is,

[02:37:24.640 --> 02:37:26.640]   asking or two, one of my oldest
[02:37:26.640 --> 02:37:28.840]   daughter, one of her friends was on
[02:37:28.840 --> 02:37:30.960]   the trip, they were both walking
[02:37:30.960 --> 02:37:33.360]   around wearing Trump 2020 shirts.
[02:37:33.360 --> 02:37:34.440]   They weren't even from

[02:37:35.400 --> 02:37:37.000]   they got them somewhere else.
[02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:38.000]   That's the cool thing to do at
[02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:38.700]   their high school,
[02:37:38.700 --> 02:37:39.840]   one of them goes to public school,
[02:37:39.840 --> 02:37:40.800]   the other goes to private.
[02:37:40.800 --> 02:37:41.880]   My daughter has a friend who
[02:37:41.880 --> 02:37:42.720]   goes to public school.
[02:37:42.720 --> 02:37:44.560]   That's the big rage, even in Austin
[02:37:44.560 --> 02:37:46.320]   where the young people is to be pro
[02:37:46.320 --> 02:37:47.960]   Trump because their parents are
[02:37:47.960 --> 02:37:49.280]   the old weird liberals.
[02:37:49.280 --> 02:37:50.760]   We're not bashing old people,
[02:37:50.760 --> 02:37:52.220]   this idea that liberals are the
[02:37:52.220 --> 02:37:53.220]   young, avant garde,
[02:37:53.220 --> 02:37:54.360]   Rolling Stones so hip,
[02:37:54.360 --> 02:37:55.880]   the Oscars are so hip.
[02:37:55.880 --> 02:37:57.680]   It's watching paint dry,
[02:37:57.680 --> 02:37:59.320]   open your wrist folks.
[02:37:59.320 --> 02:38:00.920]   So it's Generation Z is super
[02:38:00.920 --> 02:38:02.320]   libertarian, they're not
[02:38:02.320 --> 02:38:03.840]   conservative, they're just
[02:38:03.840 --> 02:38:04.880]   counterculture.
[02:38:04.880 --> 02:38:06.320]   So we'll get more to the AG report
[02:38:06.320 --> 02:38:07.840]   with you in the next segment, but
[02:38:07.840 --> 02:38:09.280]   right now the big announcement
[02:38:09.280 --> 02:38:10.840]   because I've actually said this a
[02:38:10.840 --> 02:38:11.680]   few months ago and
[02:38:11.680 --> 02:38:13.240]   I haven't got around to doing it.
[02:38:13.240 --> 02:38:14.920]   We're going to design small,
[02:38:14.920 --> 02:38:16.760]   medium and large magnet decals
[02:38:16.760 --> 02:38:18.720]   like you've done, so you can put
[02:38:18.720 --> 02:38:20.320]   it on the side of your car,
[02:38:20.320 --> 02:38:22.320]   reach 1,000 people when you go to
[02:38:22.320 --> 02:38:24.320]   work in a major city, small town,
[02:38:24.320 --> 02:38:25.840]   100, whatever.
[02:38:25.840 --> 02:38:27.120]   And then just take it off when you
[02:38:27.120 --> 02:38:28.160]   get to work or wherever,
[02:38:28.160 --> 02:38:29.240]   throw it in your vehicle.
[02:38:29.240 --> 02:38:30.520]   And then that way you have the cake
[02:38:30.520 --> 02:38:31.120]   and eat it too.
[02:38:31.120 --> 02:38:32.680]   Well, you've got a plan to bypass
[02:38:32.680 --> 02:38:33.920]   them and defeat her.
[02:38:33.920 --> 02:38:35.560]   And I think, and I know we've got
[02:38:35.560 --> 02:38:37.200]   tens of thousands of listeners in
[02:38:37.200 --> 02:38:38.720]   Massachusetts conservatively
[02:38:38.720 --> 02:38:39.800]   listening.
[02:38:39.800 --> 02:38:40.760]   Obviously over the years,
[02:38:40.760 --> 02:38:41.680]   millions have tuned in,
[02:38:41.680 --> 02:38:42.440]   in that great state.
[02:38:42.440 --> 02:38:43.680]   We've had a few affiliates there.
[02:38:43.680 --> 02:38:45.360]   Everyone listening,
[02:38:45.360 --> 02:38:47.840]   this plan you have is excellent to
[02:38:47.840 --> 02:38:50.160]   put this magnetized decal that
[02:38:50.160 --> 02:38:52.400]   doesn't do it in your paint,
[02:38:52.400 --> 02:38:54.720]   comes right off easily.
[02:38:54.720 --> 02:38:55.760]   Tell folks about your big plan,
[02:38:55.760 --> 02:38:57.200]   it's very, very exciting.
[02:38:57.200 --> 02:38:59.440]   >> Yeah, so basically the idea is,
[02:38:59.440 --> 02:39:02.360]   people want to participate.
[02:39:02.360 --> 02:39:03.800]   The establishment always wants to
[02:39:03.800 --> 02:39:06.160]   make people be onlookers.
[02:39:06.160 --> 02:39:07.280]   That's part of the establishment
[02:39:07.280 --> 02:39:07.920]   goal.
[02:39:07.920 --> 02:39:09.960]   And so it's always a little bit of
[02:39:09.960 --> 02:39:11.200]   hesitancy to go interact.
[02:39:11.200 --> 02:39:12.360]   For example, when we go out to
[02:39:12.360 --> 02:39:13.720]   parades and we distribute cards,
[02:39:13.720 --> 02:39:14.880]   Alex, and we get our first set of
[02:39:14.880 --> 02:39:16.440]   volunteers, they're always a little
[02:39:16.440 --> 02:39:17.400]   bit shy.
[02:39:17.400 --> 02:39:18.560]   And then they get this connection
[02:39:18.560 --> 02:39:19.680]   with people, people look at them in
[02:39:19.680 --> 02:39:21.280]   the eye, people start conversing.
[02:39:21.280 --> 02:39:22.160]   And that's when we get back to
[02:39:22.160 --> 02:39:23.640]   being human beings again.
[02:39:23.640 --> 02:39:26.240]   So the goal here is,
[02:39:26.240 --> 02:39:28.920]   we want to have about 10,000 people
[02:39:28.920 --> 02:39:29.920]   on the ground.
[02:39:29.920 --> 02:39:31.800]   Your car is an amazing opportunity
[02:39:31.800 --> 02:39:33.000]   to advertise, right?
[02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:34.640]   It's just a wonderful opportunity.
[02:39:34.640 --> 02:39:36.120]   You put these magnetic signs on,
[02:39:36.120 --> 02:39:37.320]   like you said, they can come off,
[02:39:37.320 --> 02:39:38.000]   come on.
[02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:39.360]   But you start a dialogue.
[02:39:39.360 --> 02:39:40.560]   When people drive around with
[02:39:40.560 --> 02:39:42.080]   these magnetic signs,
[02:39:42.080 --> 02:39:44.600]   people will honk, people pull over,
[02:39:44.600 --> 02:39:45.640]   we give them cards, but
[02:39:45.640 --> 02:39:47.480]   you start having discourse.
[02:39:47.480 --> 02:39:49.600]   And the vocal minority who start
[02:39:49.600 --> 02:39:51.160]   yelling or screaming at it,
[02:39:51.160 --> 02:39:52.480]   it's a great opportunity to have
[02:39:52.480 --> 02:39:53.440]   another discourse and
[02:39:53.440 --> 02:39:55.520]   really talk about politics,
[02:39:55.520 --> 02:39:56.920]   which the establishment doesn't
[02:39:56.920 --> 02:39:57.680]   want us to do, right?
[02:39:57.680 --> 02:39:58.480]   >> Because these are bullies
[02:39:58.480 --> 02:40:00.240]   shutting speech down on the Internet,
[02:40:00.240 --> 02:40:01.840]   on the colleges, the high schools,
[02:40:01.840 --> 02:40:03.400]   and just exercising it as
[02:40:03.400 --> 02:40:04.560]   a revolutionary act.
[02:40:04.560 --> 02:40:05.680]   Telling the truth in a world
[02:40:05.680 --> 02:40:06.560]   of universal deceit is
[02:40:06.560 --> 02:40:07.560]   a revolutionary act.
[02:40:07.560 --> 02:40:09.040]   To paraphrase Eric Blair,
[02:40:09.040 --> 02:40:10.720]   aka George Orwell, exactly.
[02:40:10.720 --> 02:40:12.760]   It is an act of resistance.
[02:40:12.760 --> 02:40:14.720]   >> It's an act of resistance, but
[02:40:14.720 --> 02:40:15.320]   more importantly,
[02:40:15.320 --> 02:40:16.160]   to have a dialogue.
[02:40:16.160 --> 02:40:18.960]   So Sunday was a Bunker Hill Day
[02:40:18.960 --> 02:40:19.880]   parade.
[02:40:19.880 --> 02:40:21.360]   That's when the American Revolution,
[02:40:21.360 --> 02:40:22.960]   after the shot in Lexington was
[02:40:22.960 --> 02:40:24.360]   shot, really took off.
[02:40:24.360 --> 02:40:25.280]   And here we went there,
[02:40:25.280 --> 02:40:26.840]   50,000 people.
[02:40:26.840 --> 02:40:28.200]   And before we were going there,
[02:40:28.200 --> 02:40:29.320]   Alex, we had to take our bus
[02:40:29.320 --> 02:40:30.720]   through Harvard Square, right in
[02:40:30.720 --> 02:40:31.960]   front of Harvard Law School,
[02:40:31.960 --> 02:40:33.360]   where Elizabeth Warren used to
[02:40:33.360 --> 02:40:34.720]   hold her professorship.
[02:40:34.720 --> 02:40:36.560]   And this Harvard Law student comes
[02:40:36.560 --> 02:40:38.120]   out and starts yelling at us,
[02:40:38.120 --> 02:40:39.960]   saying that's racist.
[02:40:39.960 --> 02:40:40.720]   And I turn around and say,
[02:40:40.720 --> 02:40:41.640]   what are you talking about
[02:40:41.640 --> 02:40:42.520]   that's racist?
[02:40:42.520 --> 02:40:44.280]   I said, you're the racist because
[02:40:44.280 --> 02:40:46.040]   you're condoning Elizabeth Warren
[02:40:46.040 --> 02:40:47.360]   who took advantage of race.
[02:40:47.360 --> 02:40:49.120]   And I said, furthermore, I said,
[02:40:49.120 --> 02:40:50.640]   you have put a bound on what
[02:40:50.640 --> 02:40:51.600]   racism is.
[02:40:51.600 --> 02:40:53.440]   If I do or if I do not use
[02:40:53.440 --> 02:40:56.240]   the N word, or if I change
[02:40:56.240 --> 02:40:57.520]   the name of some building,
[02:40:57.520 --> 02:40:58.760]   then I'm not a racist.
[02:40:58.760 --> 02:41:00.440]   I said, you guys are the racist.
[02:41:00.440 --> 02:41:01.840]   >> That's right, they use race to
[02:41:01.840 --> 02:41:03.280]   control, just like all racists
[02:41:03.280 --> 02:41:04.160]   have always done.
[02:41:04.160 --> 02:41:06.000]   To change the subject, you got poor
[02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:07.840]   white sharecroppers versus black
[02:41:07.840 --> 02:41:09.960]   slaves playing against each other.
[02:41:09.960 --> 02:41:11.240]   It's the same story of divide and
[02:41:11.240 --> 02:41:12.160]   conquer over and over again.
[02:41:12.160 --> 02:41:14.400]   >> Yeah, and what's interesting is
[02:41:14.400 --> 02:41:16.240]   when we put this out,
[02:41:16.240 --> 02:41:18.160]   we had some guy come on to my
[02:41:18.160 --> 02:41:19.840]   Twitter feed and say,
[02:41:19.840 --> 02:41:21.720]   you are a curry Indian.
[02:41:21.720 --> 02:41:22.640]   I don't know if I can use the N
[02:41:22.640 --> 02:41:23.680]   word here, can I, Alex,
[02:41:23.680 --> 02:41:24.400]   on your show?
[02:41:24.400 --> 02:41:25.440]   Probably not, right?
[02:41:25.440 --> 02:41:26.400]   I don't know, let's not do it.
[02:41:26.400 --> 02:41:28.800]   >> Okay, well, he said you're
[02:41:28.800 --> 02:41:30.920]   a curry Indian N, okay?
[02:41:30.920 --> 02:41:32.720]   So I responded back on Twitter and
[02:41:32.720 --> 02:41:34.120]   you can see it because it was
[02:41:34.120 --> 02:41:34.800]   a response.
[02:41:34.800 --> 02:41:36.840]   And I said, let me be accurate,
[02:41:36.840 --> 02:41:38.800]   we're all Ns on the deep state,
[02:41:38.800 --> 02:41:40.720]   on the white liberal deep state
[02:41:40.720 --> 02:41:42.840]   reservation, which went viral.
[02:41:42.840 --> 02:41:44.240]   My point is a person of my
[02:41:44.240 --> 02:41:46.360]   background who's been an American,
[02:41:46.360 --> 02:41:47.600]   who's worked hard and
[02:41:47.600 --> 02:41:48.640]   who's struggled,
[02:41:48.640 --> 02:41:49.920]   has a unique opportunity.
[02:41:49.920 --> 02:41:51.600]   And all of us should take advantage
[02:41:51.600 --> 02:41:53.120]   of the fact that I'm running to
[02:41:53.120 --> 02:41:54.720]   really expand the discussion of
[02:41:54.720 --> 02:41:56.000]   race and realize that it's
[02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:57.600]   the deep state which wants to pit
[02:41:57.600 --> 02:41:59.760]   poor whites against poor blacks.
[02:41:59.760 --> 02:42:01.320]   They thrive on race war.
[02:42:01.320 --> 02:42:03.040]   So this putting this on is not
[02:42:03.040 --> 02:42:04.000]   about race, but
[02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:06.040]   it's really about integrity.
[02:42:06.040 --> 02:42:07.440]   And it really goes- >> That's right,
[02:42:07.440 --> 02:42:09.000]   and they think they own the whole
[02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:10.480]   race debate to promulgate it,
[02:42:10.480 --> 02:42:11.320]   to make it worse.
[02:42:11.320 --> 02:42:13.200]   Then they're the high priest that
[02:42:13.200 --> 02:42:15.360]   program what is racist, what isn't,
[02:42:15.360 --> 02:42:17.280]   actually covering up real inequity
[02:42:17.280 --> 02:42:18.400]   and real problems.
[02:42:18.400 --> 02:42:20.240]   So here's the big call to action.
[02:42:20.240 --> 02:42:20.920]   How do folks,
[02:42:20.920 --> 02:42:21.960]   even if they're not in
[02:42:21.960 --> 02:42:23.720]   Massachusetts, how do they get one
[02:42:23.720 --> 02:42:24.560]   of these babies?
[02:42:25.200 --> 02:42:25.800]   >> It's very easy.
[02:42:25.800 --> 02:42:27.760]   You just go to shiva4senate.com.
[02:42:27.760 --> 02:42:28.720]   You can find it right there.
[02:42:28.720 --> 02:42:30.160]   It's called a Road Warrior kit.
[02:42:30.160 --> 02:42:31.080]   Go to the store,
[02:42:31.080 --> 02:42:32.520]   get the Road Warrior kit.
[02:42:32.520 --> 02:42:33.280]   We've made it.
[02:42:33.280 --> 02:42:34.680]   You get two magnetic stickers,
[02:42:34.680 --> 02:42:35.400]   get a lawn sign,
[02:42:35.400 --> 02:42:36.680]   you get two bumper stickers.
[02:42:36.680 --> 02:42:37.920]   >> My God, you gotta call this
[02:42:37.920 --> 02:42:39.360]   Operation Road Warrior.
[02:42:39.360 --> 02:42:40.120]   Is that what you're calling it?
[02:42:40.120 --> 02:42:40.760]   >> That's what I call it.
[02:42:40.760 --> 02:42:42.080]   It's called Road Warrior.
[02:42:42.080 --> 02:42:43.400]   Be a Road Warrior.
[02:42:43.400 --> 02:42:45.080]   That's getting back.
[02:42:45.080 --> 02:42:46.360]   So if you can't come to and
[02:42:46.360 --> 02:42:48.320]   pass out cards, you can't do
[02:42:48.320 --> 02:42:49.760]   anything, you got family.
[02:42:49.760 --> 02:42:51.760]   >> Hey, I'm fully supporting this.
[02:42:51.760 --> 02:42:52.720]   But I am stealing the idea.
[02:42:52.720 --> 02:42:53.720]   We're going to launch Operation
[02:42:53.720 --> 02:42:54.720]   Road Warrior with our stuff too.
[02:42:54.720 --> 02:42:56.440]   >> Guaranteeing your food
[02:42:56.440 --> 02:42:58.040]   independence is a crucial part
[02:42:58.040 --> 02:42:58.960]   of prepping.
[02:42:58.960 --> 02:43:00.360]   Between debt crisis,
[02:43:00.360 --> 02:43:01.800]   natural disasters, or
[02:43:01.800 --> 02:43:03.760]   even simple power outages,
[02:43:03.760 --> 02:43:05.800]   having a supply of storable meals
[02:43:05.800 --> 02:43:06.960]   is crucial.
[02:43:06.960 --> 02:43:08.640]   With InfoWars Life Select

[02:43:40.080 --> 02:43:41.600]   and you have easy-to-cook and

[02:43:43.080 --> 02:43:44.480]   loved one's trip.
[02:43:44.480 --> 02:43:45.640]   Don't be caught surprised
[02:43:45.640 --> 02:43:47.000]   by an emergency.

[02:43:55.080 --> 02:43:56.960]   >> Living in volcano may sound
[02:43:56.960 --> 02:43:59.080]   more dramatic than it really is.
[02:43:59.080 --> 02:44:00.800]   The real drama can be found here
[02:44:00.800 --> 02:44:02.360]   in Leilani Estates.
[02:44:02.360 --> 02:44:03.720]   But a lot of us on the Big Island
[02:44:03.720 --> 02:44:05.640]   rely on rainwater, and we need to
[02:44:05.640 --> 02:44:07.400]   be concerned about ash and
[02:44:07.400 --> 02:44:08.600]   acid rain.
[02:44:08.600 --> 02:44:10.280]   Volcanic ash may contain
[02:44:10.280 --> 02:44:12.600]   heavy metal particles, and acid
[02:44:12.600 --> 02:44:14.160]   rain could lower the pH of the
[02:44:14.160 --> 02:44:15.960]   water to unhealthy levels.
[02:44:15.960 --> 02:44:17.960]   To find out, we employed a series
[02:44:17.960 --> 02:44:20.120]   of tests for heavy metals,
[02:44:20.120 --> 02:44:22.440]   alkalinity, and pH.
[02:44:22.440 --> 02:44:23.480]   What we learned was that there
[02:44:23.480 --> 02:44:25.280]   was, in fact, unhealthy levels of
[02:44:25.280 --> 02:44:26.880]   heavy metals and acidity in the
[02:44:26.880 --> 02:44:28.120]   rainwater.
[02:44:28.120 --> 02:44:29.880]   Next, we tested the water from
[02:44:29.880 --> 02:44:32.040]   our AlexaPure gravity filter.
[02:44:32.040 --> 02:44:33.560]   And not only were the heavy metal
[02:44:33.560 --> 02:44:35.600]   levels within safe measure,
[02:44:35.600 --> 02:44:37.680]   but the pH was also restored
[02:44:37.680 --> 02:44:39.200]   to optimal levels.
[02:44:39.200 --> 02:44:41.280]   As it turns out, the filter on
[02:44:41.280 --> 02:44:43.400]   the AlexaPure raises the pH
[02:44:43.400 --> 02:44:44.520]   of the water.
[02:44:44.520 --> 02:44:45.600]   So what we've learned is that
[02:44:45.600 --> 02:44:47.800]   volcanic ash and acid rain can
[02:44:47.800 --> 02:44:50.160]   contaminate a rainwater supply.
[02:44:50.160 --> 02:44:51.920]   But more importantly, a good
[02:44:51.920 --> 02:44:53.400]   water filtration system will
[02:44:53.400 --> 02:44:54.400]   purify it.

[02:45:53.080 --> 02:45:57.800]   Staying healthy on the go is
[02:45:57.800 --> 02:45:59.200]   just as important as staying
[02:45:59.200 --> 02:46:00.200]   healthy at home.
[02:46:00.200 --> 02:46:01.920]   But sometimes supplements don't
[02:46:01.920 --> 02:46:02.920]   work fast enough.
[02:46:02.920 --> 02:46:04.760]   That's why InfowarsLife has

[02:46:55.600 --> 02:47:00.920]   You're listening to the Alex
[02:47:00.920 --> 02:47:01.920]   Jones Show.
[02:47:01.920 --> 02:47:10.920]   I've got a tiger in my tail,
[02:47:10.920 --> 02:47:13.920]   it's plain to see.
[02:47:13.920 --> 02:47:16.920]   I won't be much when you get
[02:47:16.920 --> 02:47:17.920]   through with me.
[02:47:17.920 --> 02:47:19.920]   He never gives up.
[02:47:19.920 --> 02:47:22.920]   He's Alex Jones, broadcasting
[02:47:22.920 --> 02:47:24.920]   from deep in the heart of Texas,
[02:47:24.920 --> 02:47:26.920]   worldwide.
[02:47:26.920 --> 02:47:30.920]   Well I thought one day I met
[02:47:30.920 --> 02:47:32.920]   you, you weren't with me.
[02:47:32.920 --> 02:47:34.420]   >> Coming up in the next hour,
[02:47:34.420 --> 02:47:35.920]   it's going to be Doug Hagman,
[02:47:35.920 --> 02:47:37.420]   who's a great crime expert,
[02:47:37.420 --> 02:47:38.920]   getting into the AG report.
[02:47:38.920 --> 02:47:39.920]   And then the hour after that,
[02:47:39.920 --> 02:47:40.920]   we'll get off the war room,
[02:47:40.920 --> 02:47:41.920]   Roger Stone gets into it.
[02:47:41.920 --> 02:47:42.920]   But it's bad,
[02:47:42.920 --> 02:47:44.420]   it's what we already knew.
[02:47:44.420 --> 02:47:45.920]   But more emails, more text
[02:47:45.920 --> 02:47:47.920]   messages, Comey using his own
[02:47:47.920 --> 02:47:49.920]   private email, giving people
[02:47:49.920 --> 02:47:51.920]   advance warning they were going to
[02:47:51.920 --> 02:47:53.420]   be called to testify, but
[02:47:53.420 --> 02:47:54.920]   it's trying to fix evidence.
[02:47:54.920 --> 02:47:56.420]   FBI agent Strzok reportedly texted
[02:47:56.420 --> 02:47:57.920]   we'll stop Trump from becoming
[02:47:57.920 --> 02:47:58.420]   president.
[02:47:58.420 --> 02:47:59.920]   That's all being reported,
[02:47:59.920 --> 02:48:00.920]   go to infowars.com.
[02:48:00.920 --> 02:48:02.920]   And infowars.com along with the AG
[02:48:02.920 --> 02:48:04.920]   report if you want to go try to
[02:48:04.920 --> 02:48:06.920]   read the 500 pages for yourself.
[02:48:06.920 --> 02:48:07.920]   We're talking to Dr.
[02:48:07.920 --> 02:48:08.920]   Sheba running for
[02:48:08.920 --> 02:48:10.920]   Senate in Massachusetts against
[02:48:10.920 --> 02:48:12.920]   the fake Native American,
[02:48:12.920 --> 02:48:15.420]   Elizabeth Warren, aka Pocahontas.
[02:48:15.420 --> 02:48:17.920]   Continuing, ladies and
[02:48:17.920 --> 02:48:19.420]   gentlemen, though, we're three
[02:48:19.420 --> 02:48:20.920]   hours into this broadcast almost
[02:48:20.920 --> 02:48:21.920]   and I'm barely plugged.
[02:48:21.920 --> 02:48:23.920]   We're doing a 34 hour broadcast to
[02:48:23.920 --> 02:48:25.920]   cover all the big news, to expand
[02:48:25.920 --> 02:48:27.420]   what we're doing to get some of
[02:48:27.420 --> 02:48:28.420]   the new crew trained.
[02:48:28.420 --> 02:48:29.920]   We're going to start adding more
[02:48:29.920 --> 02:48:30.920]   shows here very soon.
[02:48:30.920 --> 02:48:32.420]   That takes money.
[02:48:32.420 --> 02:48:33.920]   And I'm discounting a lot of our
[02:48:33.920 --> 02:48:35.420]   products so much because when I
[02:48:35.420 --> 02:48:36.920]   go really, really low on these
[02:48:36.920 --> 02:48:38.420]   products, people that hadn't tried
[02:48:38.420 --> 02:48:39.920]   them try them, then they become
[02:48:39.920 --> 02:48:41.420]   customers because they like them,
[02:48:41.420 --> 02:48:42.420]   they love them.
[02:48:42.420 --> 02:48:44.420]   Infowarsstore.com, we have had for
[02:48:44.420 --> 02:48:46.420]   a couple of weeks free shipping
[02:48:46.420 --> 02:48:48.420]   on a bunch of our best selling
[02:48:48.420 --> 02:48:50.420]   items, more than 20 items.

[03:21:24.420 --> 03:21:30.420]   >> We are not the enemy of the people we love.
[03:21:30.420 --> 03:21:36.420]   [MUSIC]
[03:21:36.420 --> 03:21:42.420]   >> This is CNN.
[03:21:42.420 --> 03:21:46.420]   >> You are the resistance.
[03:21:46.420 --> 03:21:54.420]   >> I just felt like I walked up to the star cheerleader when I was a freshman in high school and asked the senior cheerleader out on a date and she said yes.
[03:21:54.420 --> 03:21:58.420]   So those little feelings of ecstasy when your brain releases a little bit of endorphin.
[03:21:58.420 --> 03:22:02.420]   I just -- I hadn't seen that promo piece that I had the idea for this morning.
[03:22:02.420 --> 03:22:04.420]   But the guys did a great job putting it together.
[03:22:04.420 --> 03:22:08.420]   And I just had a brain orgasm.
[03:22:08.420 --> 03:22:10.420]   I mean, I'm not kidding.
[03:22:10.420 --> 03:22:14.420]   I just -- oh, ooh, excuse me.
[03:22:14.420 --> 03:22:16.420]   Oh, my gosh.
[03:22:16.420 --> 03:22:18.420]   Look at this.
[03:22:18.420 --> 03:22:20.420]   Viva la resistance.
[03:22:20.420 --> 03:22:22.420]   Mueller team attorney sent anti-Trump text.
[03:22:22.420 --> 03:22:24.420]   As we go through the 500 pages.
[03:22:24.420 --> 03:22:26.420]   This is the daily caller.com.
[03:22:26.420 --> 03:22:28.420]   It's up on infowars.com.
[03:22:28.420 --> 03:22:30.420]   I was going to leave but I'm just here taking over.
[03:22:30.420 --> 03:22:32.420]   I want to do a whole show with Hagman soon.
[03:22:32.420 --> 03:22:34.420]   He's going to be working with us.
[03:22:34.420 --> 03:22:36.420]   Hagman is awesome.
[03:22:36.420 --> 03:22:38.420]   I want to hear his breakdown on this.
[03:22:38.420 --> 03:22:40.420]   His law enforcement sources are amazing.
[03:22:40.420 --> 03:22:42.420]   But you've got this.
[03:22:42.420 --> 03:22:44.420]   Trump will never be elected.
[03:22:44.420 --> 03:22:48.420]   I mean, this is just getting more and more insane.
[03:22:48.420 --> 03:22:50.420]   And as Trump succeeds showing they were artificially suppressing things.
[03:22:50.420 --> 03:22:56.420]   I don't want to say Trump was like, you know, the second coming or whatever.
[03:22:56.420 --> 03:22:58.420]   But the truth is Trump is just not out to get us.
[03:22:58.420 --> 03:23:00.420]   And he's got courage and stamina and is smart.
[03:23:00.420 --> 03:23:06.420]   But he's removing the artificial criminality where they want to make us poor.
[03:23:06.420 --> 03:23:08.420]   That's the essence of globalism.
[03:23:08.420 --> 03:23:16.420]   CNN, MSNBC, Netflix, news shows, Bill Maher, HBO saying we want to implode the economy.
[03:23:16.420 --> 03:23:18.420]   We want nuclear war to stop Trump.
[03:23:18.420 --> 03:23:20.420]   They've entered cuckoo land.
[03:23:20.420 --> 03:23:22.420]   Doug Hagman, I'm done.
[03:23:22.420 --> 03:23:24.420]   You take over of hagmanreport.com, my friend.
[03:23:24.420 --> 03:23:26.420]   Hey, thanks, Alex.
[03:23:26.420 --> 03:23:28.420]   Appreciate it.
[03:23:28.420 --> 03:23:32.420]   What you were just referencing there, by the way, the messages that were expunged, the page struck messages.
[03:23:32.420 --> 03:23:40.420]   It was a reference to an exchange that took place on August 8, 2016, between Lisa Page and Peter Strzok.
[03:23:40.420 --> 03:23:44.420]   And basically, here's what happened.
[03:23:44.420 --> 03:24:00.420]   The inspector general found messages that were expunged and, of course, reported on these messages to the Department of Justice, actually the office of the deputy attorney general just last month.
[03:24:00.420 --> 03:24:16.420]   And what was expunged or taken out of that exchange of August 8, 2016, of these two FBI swamp creatures, again, struck and page, was the exchange.
[03:24:16.420 --> 03:24:18.420]   And I'm looking at my notes here.
[03:24:18.420 --> 03:24:26.420]   Lisa Page saying he's not going to become president.
[03:24:26.420 --> 03:24:28.420]   No, no, we're going to stop him.
[03:24:28.420 --> 03:24:34.420]   Is what was erased from the messages that were given.
[03:24:34.420 --> 03:24:44.420]   And doesn't that create the criminal intent that they are erasing evidence of them in their official capacity, saying we're politically not going to let him get elected using our official capacity?
[03:24:44.420 --> 03:24:46.420]   I mean, that is criminal civil rights violations.
[03:24:46.420 --> 03:24:50.420]   Every citizen that's a voter has been attempted to be disenfranchised.
[03:24:50.420 --> 03:24:52.420]   This is huge.
[03:24:52.420 --> 03:24:54.420]   Well, exactly.
[03:24:54.420 --> 03:24:56.420]   It does show criminal intent.
[03:24:56.420 --> 03:25:00.420]   Now, you've got to prove on a legal basis criminal intent.
[03:25:00.420 --> 03:25:08.420]   But certainly that, to me, is prima facie evidence of legal intent or of the legal definition of intent if I've ever seen it.
[03:25:08.420 --> 03:25:14.420]   I'm not an attorney, but working with attorneys, you can see that there's a plan going on that we're going to stop.
[03:25:14.420 --> 03:25:19.420]   We're going to develop a fake plan to stop him from getting elected in our official capacity, and then we're going to erase it later.
[03:25:19.420 --> 03:25:21.420]   Exactly.
[03:25:21.420 --> 03:25:31.420]   People have got to understand, too, that this does not -- that exchange was removed not from the technical error that they supposedly had between December 2015 or December 15, 2016.
[03:25:31.420 --> 03:25:33.420]   Oh, I've forgotten the error.
[03:25:33.420 --> 03:25:35.420]   And then, of course, it wasn't an error.
[03:25:35.420 --> 03:25:36.420]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[03:25:36.420 --> 03:25:42.420]   Which is another crime, the FBI lying and saying it had all been removed by error when it wasn't, which is a more fraud.
[03:25:42.420 --> 03:25:44.420]   Precisely.
[03:25:44.420 --> 03:25:47.420]   So where are these text messages?
[03:25:47.420 --> 03:25:52.420]   I guess you could go down to the NSA and grab a copy if you really need to.
[03:25:52.420 --> 03:25:56.420]   But the bottom line, yeah, this -- first of all, you've got two issues.
[03:25:56.420 --> 03:26:05.420]   You've got the December 15, 2016 issue through May 17, 2017, coincidentally the day that Mueller was appointed special counsel, that are missing.
[03:26:05.420 --> 03:26:22.420]   But outside of that, the expungement or the extraction of that one sentence that does prove criminal intent, in my view, that should be used as the basis of criminal prosecution, again, in my view, not being a lawyer.
[03:26:22.420 --> 03:26:25.420]   To continue, I just -- wild horses can't drag me away.
[03:26:25.420 --> 03:26:27.420]   And we're just going through this.
[03:26:27.420 --> 03:26:29.420]   And when you come back, you'll get more into it.
[03:26:29.420 --> 03:26:38.420]   Do you agree with me, and I haven't read the whole thing yet, but I've looked at people that did analysis, I've scanned over it, that the tone is real, oh, no one's criminal, but there was intent to throw the election.
[03:26:38.420 --> 03:26:39.420]   They did try to hide things.
[03:26:39.420 --> 03:26:45.420]   It's like they're putting out the breadcrumbs and saying this is illegal, but not saying it because that's not their place.
[03:26:45.420 --> 03:26:46.420]   Well, exactly.
[03:26:46.420 --> 03:26:47.420]   Yeah, I agree with that.
[03:26:47.420 --> 03:26:48.420]   Here is the report.
[03:26:48.420 --> 03:26:52.420]   Right now I had my staff -- in fact, here's half of it.
[03:26:52.420 --> 03:26:54.420]   The other half is still on the printer.
[03:26:54.420 --> 03:26:56.420]   It's the report --
[03:26:56.420 --> 03:26:57.420]   500 pages.
[03:26:57.420 --> 03:26:59.420]   Yeah, it's 499 of content.
[03:26:59.420 --> 03:27:02.420]   The rest is appendices and attachments.
[03:27:02.420 --> 03:27:06.420]   Conciliatory, I suppose, would be a good word to describe it.
[03:27:06.420 --> 03:27:08.420]   I haven't gone through the whole thing.
[03:27:08.420 --> 03:27:12.420]   Listening to, of course, the various talkers out there saying, well, you know what --
[03:27:12.420 --> 03:27:13.420]   But it's backhanded.
[03:27:13.420 --> 03:27:21.420]   Scanning what I've scanned, it's like, oh, they're doing criminal, but they did try to fix the election and did lie and did not follow bureau and did make us look bad and our piece of filth.
[03:27:21.420 --> 03:27:23.420]   Exactly.
[03:27:23.420 --> 03:27:24.420]   But here's the thing.
[03:27:24.420 --> 03:27:33.420]   You could probably toss this into a washing machine, and depending on who gets the laundry out of that washing machine from the spin cycle, you can spin it however.
[03:27:33.420 --> 03:27:43.420]   Now, there's some pretty damning -- I think the most damning part, just from what I was able to see just really quickly here, looks like the -- and we could talk about this at some point.
[03:27:43.420 --> 03:27:46.420]   But it looks like the most damning part appears to be the delay.
[03:27:46.420 --> 03:28:01.420]   And this is where you and I spoke about this, the delay between the finding the emails, classified emails, with respect to the -- my goodness, the Huma Abedin emails.
[03:28:01.420 --> 03:28:03.420]   And the --
[03:28:03.420 --> 03:28:07.420]   And this goes back to why the FBI was punning back and forth and reopening the investigation.
[03:28:07.420 --> 03:28:09.420]   So you'll have time when you come back, and I'm going to leave now.
[03:28:09.420 --> 03:28:11.420]   I'll be watching while I have lunch.
[03:28:11.420 --> 03:28:12.420]   You're going to break all this down.
[03:28:12.420 --> 03:28:16.420]   But it looks to me like they're putting the facts in there.
[03:28:16.420 --> 03:28:20.420]   They don't want to make political statements or statements of judgment, so they're punting.
[03:28:20.420 --> 03:28:28.420]   But there still is some kind of obfuscation just because it's the same agency investigating itself.
[03:28:28.420 --> 03:28:29.420]   Do you think that's accurate?
[03:28:29.420 --> 03:28:30.420]   Right.
[03:28:30.420 --> 03:28:31.420]   Yeah, I think so.
[03:28:31.420 --> 03:28:36.420]   No criminal referrals yet, but we'll see.
[03:28:36.420 --> 03:28:42.420]   Well, I heard -- we'll see what your sources say, that they've got working indictments ready to go to grand jury.
[03:28:42.420 --> 03:28:45.420]   So we'll hear about that straight ahead with Doug Hagman of The Hagman Report.

[03:31:04.420 --> 03:31:12.420]   I remember back when Infowars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen, and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet.
[03:31:12.420 --> 03:31:17.420]   And I thought it was pretty cool. And I read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests.
[03:31:17.420 --> 03:31:21.420]   And I've been using your products since the first iteration of Survival Shield.
[03:31:21.420 --> 03:31:29.420]   And since then, I'm on the X2, the Supermail Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, Micro ZX, Body. It's all amazing.
[03:31:29.420 --> 03:31:30.420]   Thank you, brother.
[03:31:30.420 --> 03:31:38.420]   Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[03:31:38.420 --> 03:31:43.420]   And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[03:31:43.420 --> 03:31:50.420]   And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.
[03:31:50.420 --> 03:31:57.420]   Living in Volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:31:57.420 --> 03:32:00.420]   The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[03:32:00.420 --> 03:32:06.420]   But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater, and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:32:06.420 --> 03:32:14.420]   Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles, and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[03:32:14.420 --> 03:32:20.420]   To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:32:20.420 --> 03:32:26.420]   What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:32:26.420 --> 03:32:30.420]   Next, we tested the water from our AlexaPure gravity filter.
[03:32:30.420 --> 03:32:37.420]   And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:32:37.420 --> 03:32:42.420]   As it turns out, the filter on the AlexaPure raises the pH of the water.
[03:32:42.420 --> 03:32:48.420]   So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:32:48.420 --> 03:32:53.420]   But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:32:55.420 --> 03:32:59.420]   You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:32:59.420 --> 03:33:19.420]   Live, raw, and unfiltered by globalist propaganda.
[03:33:19.420 --> 03:33:24.420]   It's The Alex Jones Show. Tomorrow's news today.
[03:33:24.420 --> 03:33:32.420]   Infowars.com. Doug Hagman sitting in for Alex Jones.
[03:33:32.420 --> 03:33:38.420]   Thank you so much for tuning in. It's a pleasure to be hosting Doug Hagman again for Infowars.
[03:33:38.420 --> 03:33:40.420]   My website, HagmanReport.com.
[03:33:40.420 --> 03:33:47.420]   And right now, it's a historic day. Aside from being day 511 of the Donald Trump presidency,
[03:33:47.420 --> 03:33:55.420]   it is also Donald Trump's birthday, it's Flag Day, and it's the much-awaited, it's the day of the much-awaited OIG report.
[03:33:55.420 --> 03:34:04.420]   Here it is right here. It's been released. It's 568 pages with attachments and appendices, 499 pages of content.
[03:34:04.420 --> 03:34:09.420]   And I have not read through the report, so why would I even be talking about the report?
[03:34:09.420 --> 03:34:13.420]   Obviously, it just came out prior to airtime. There's been a lot of leaks with respect to the report,
[03:34:13.420 --> 03:34:18.420]   but the report itself just came out before I came on, a little bit before I came on.
[03:34:18.420 --> 03:34:26.420]   But it's a product of an 18-month investigation by the inspector general, a review of the FBI DOJ,
[03:34:26.420 --> 03:34:29.420]   the investigation of the Hillary Clinton email.
[03:34:29.420 --> 03:34:35.420]   This particular inquiry, this investigative work product is specifically looking into whether the FBI,
[03:34:35.420 --> 03:34:43.420]   whether the Department of Justice was corrupted by the political influence in their determination of the Clinton outcome.
[03:34:43.420 --> 03:34:48.420]   End of story. The IG report provides background on the overall issues, the potential crimes,
[03:34:48.420 --> 03:34:55.420]   the subsequent cover-up, and the corruption that infested the 2016 Department of Justice and the FBI.
[03:34:55.420 --> 03:35:01.420]   Now, you're going to have a lot of people out there attempting to spin this in every different direction,
[03:35:01.420 --> 03:35:06.420]   rip it apart, saying, "Oh, it's nothing." They're going to call it a nothing burger, of course.
[03:35:06.420 --> 03:35:10.420]   They're going to say, "Well, it's not rooted in political bias."
[03:35:10.420 --> 03:35:18.420]   But here's the bottom line. You've got a lot of top-level officials, government, political officials,
[03:35:18.420 --> 03:35:26.420]   government officials, and even some within the rank and file, like, well, if you would consider Stroker Page a rank and file,
[03:35:26.420 --> 03:35:37.420]   within the government, doing a lot of breaking of laws, potential Hatch Act violations, and other such problems.
[03:35:37.420 --> 03:35:44.420]   Here's, I think, what we need to ask ourselves. Is this just merely only about politics?
[03:35:44.420 --> 03:35:52.420]   Is this the -- what we're looking at here, did Comey, did Brennan, did Lynch, did all of these individuals,
[03:35:52.420 --> 03:35:58.420]   Stroker and Page, as you see there, did they do this -- and I've talked about this before --
[03:35:58.420 --> 03:36:08.420]   did they risk their jobs, but more importantly, their freedom, that being the freedom, you know, their freedom from jail,
[03:36:08.420 --> 03:36:14.420]   or from indictments for seditious or potentially treasonous activity?
[03:36:14.420 --> 03:36:20.420]   Did they risk it simply for Hillary Clinton to get Hillary Clinton into office?
[03:36:20.420 --> 03:36:25.420]   Now, think about that question before you say, "Oh, yeah, that's all it is. Yeah, they love Hillary Clinton,
[03:36:25.420 --> 03:36:33.420]   and they hated Donald Trump that much." Think about it. Did they do this only, only for political purposes?
[03:36:33.420 --> 03:36:44.420]   And I would venture to say no. There is an ideology behind this, an ideology of this communist utopia that is propelling this,
[03:36:44.420 --> 03:36:53.420]   the ideology of this Marxist, Stalinist, Leninist, whatever you want to call it, but it is that ideology, in my view,
[03:36:53.420 --> 03:36:58.420]   that is responsible for their activities. It's much bigger than politics.
[03:36:58.420 --> 03:37:04.420]   So, this weekend, when you're lounging by the pool, doing some casual reading of the OIG report,
[03:37:04.420 --> 03:37:12.420]   I'm sure you will be, right, turning the pages, printing it out, or I guess on your electronic device,
[03:37:12.420 --> 03:37:20.420]   think about what you're reading and think about the bigger issue, the deeper issue, dig deeper, think bigger,
[03:37:20.420 --> 03:37:29.420]   about what we're looking at, because we can all take this and segment the various granular details,
[03:37:29.420 --> 03:37:37.420]   and I believe we need to do that, but what's really taking place in terms of the larger picture?
[03:37:37.420 --> 03:37:44.420]   And that's what I really want to say. And I was talking to Alex, and I just want to drive this point home.
[03:37:44.420 --> 03:37:50.420]   It's interesting that suddenly, those people who have taken the Inspector General to task,
[03:37:50.420 --> 03:37:56.420]   Michael Horowitz, saying he's an Obama plant, yes, and Paul Sperry had some interesting information
[03:37:56.420 --> 03:38:01.420]   that he posted on his Twitter account, the scared Paul Sperry, the scared reporter,
[03:38:01.420 --> 03:38:07.420]   about the relationships with Michael Horowitz, but think about this, it was Michael Horowitz,
[03:38:07.420 --> 03:38:18.420]   Inspector General, who in fact pointed out that last month, that a sentence, a reply by Peter Strzok
[03:38:18.420 --> 03:38:24.420]   to Lisa Page was omitted from the text messages that were sent to Congress.
[03:38:24.420 --> 03:38:37.420]   Well, in my view, there is some integrity there, and I think that that does show the integrity of Horowitz at this point.
[03:38:37.420 --> 03:38:45.420]   Now, opinions are like, you know what, right? So, analyses without reading the report would really not do you
[03:38:45.420 --> 03:38:53.420]   or anyone else any favors, but you can see just from the reactions, right now I'm looking at reactions of the talkers,
[03:38:53.420 --> 03:39:01.420]   I'm looking at reactions of the people such as Maddow and Matthews and, or Limbaugh on the right,
[03:39:01.420 --> 03:39:08.420]   I'm looking at their reactions to assess what their take is for the purposes of advancing the narrative.
[03:39:08.420 --> 03:39:12.420]   What's their narrative, whether it's on the right or on the left?
[03:39:12.420 --> 03:39:18.420]   And I'm doing that without having read the report, again, because the report just came out.
[03:39:18.420 --> 03:39:25.420]   The reason I mention that is it's important, in my view, it is extremely important to understand that news,
[03:39:25.420 --> 03:39:30.420]   as it stands today, is nothing but a running agenda.
[03:39:30.420 --> 03:39:35.420]   In other words, everyone's got an agenda, whether it's on the right or on the left, conservative or democratic socialist.
[03:39:35.420 --> 03:39:43.420]   So, it's up to you, the listener, the viewer of this show, to make up your own mind based on what you read.
[03:39:43.420 --> 03:39:49.420]   And I would suggest everyone listening, if you're listening or reviewing this broadcast, do yourself a favor,
[03:39:49.420 --> 03:39:58.420]   download the report, the link is, you can find it everywhere, but remember, this is just one of more,
[03:39:58.420 --> 03:40:02.420]   this is one of at least three such reports that are forthcoming.
[03:40:02.420 --> 03:40:11.420]   And from what I've read, it is kind of damning in terms of the intent, whether or not this results in criminal indictments.
[03:40:11.420 --> 03:40:17.420]   By the way, the other aspect of this, I've noticed people saying, "Well, I don't see any criminal referrals based on this report."
[03:40:17.420 --> 03:40:20.420]   You're not going to find criminal referrals. That's not the purpose of this report.
[03:40:20.420 --> 03:40:24.420]   This report does not make criminal referrals.
[03:40:24.420 --> 03:40:34.420]   However, when this report is given to the Department of Justice, the executive branch, to be more precise, that includes Donald Trump,
[03:40:34.420 --> 03:40:42.420]   it is from there that the criminal indictments or criminal referrals, more specifically, will be made.
[03:40:42.420 --> 03:40:49.420]   So, if you were looking at this and expecting to see, "Well, we recommend a criminal prosecution,"
[03:40:49.420 --> 03:40:57.420]   that's not what the Inspector General does, at least not as a rule.
[03:40:57.420 --> 03:41:05.420]   I just want to say that the criminal referrals must come and would come from the Department of Justice or the executive branch.
[03:41:05.420 --> 03:41:16.420]   So, just keep that in mind as you read this, and don't let people tear you down or tear down your positive thoughts that we could see justice
[03:41:16.420 --> 03:41:20.420]   because there's the absence of recommendation for criminal referrals.
[03:41:20.420 --> 03:41:24.420]   I did not expect to see any. All right? So, that's something totally different.
[03:41:24.420 --> 03:41:33.420]   Folks, visit Infowarsstore.com. I want to mention this because Alex and I were talking during the break and during the show.

[03:45:17.420 --> 03:45:29.420]   It is a classical 360 wind. This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.

[03:47:02.420 --> 03:47:14.420]   [Music]
[03:47:14.420 --> 03:47:20.420]   The Alex Jones Show. Because there is a war on for your mind.
[03:47:20.420 --> 03:47:27.420]   [Music]
[03:47:27.420 --> 03:47:36.420]   You're listening to Infowars. Doug Hagman sitting in for Alex Jones. Doug Hagman, HagmanReport.com, that's my home base. Infowars, Infowars.com, that's where you need to go.
[03:47:36.420 --> 03:47:41.420]   InfowarsStore to support this operation. Very proud to be sitting in for Alex.
[03:47:41.420 --> 03:47:57.420]   I gotta tell you, look, we're going to be talking about the OIG report at some point, okay? It's 499 pages of content, total of 568 pages with attachments and appendices.
[03:47:57.420 --> 03:48:02.420]   So it's going to take some time to go through. It just broke today, just a couple of hours ago.
[03:48:02.420 --> 03:48:14.420]   Leaks, and it's important, leaks, of course, were just incredible earlier today. It's interesting how Bloomberg reported on leaks and the spinning of leaks.
[03:48:14.420 --> 03:48:20.420]   But we're going to be taking this apart page by page, word by word, basically, and making sense of it.
[03:48:20.420 --> 03:48:36.420]   Remember, this is just one small aspect. And remember, this is about the least, the most scandal-free presidency of our lifetimes, and that is Barack Hussein Obama.
[03:48:36.420 --> 03:48:44.420]   This, I'm going to lead off with real quick here. We've got just so much news, so little time.
[03:48:44.420 --> 03:48:52.420]   Sally Yates, the Department of Justice, ordered the FBI not to overtly investigate the Clinton Foundation.
[03:48:52.420 --> 03:49:01.420]   Folks, Charles Rittel, he's a great researcher, talking about the Clinton Foundation. But think about this.
[03:49:01.420 --> 03:49:10.420]   The Deputy Attorney General fired by President Donald Trump hamstrung federal investigators' efforts to probe the Clinton Foundation.
[03:49:10.420 --> 03:49:24.420]   You're going to be hearing more about this as Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates revealed the Department of Justice instructed federal investigators to hold back opening a probe of the Clinton Foundation.
[03:49:24.420 --> 03:49:29.420]   And aren't we seeing the Clinton Foundation, the incestuous relationships of the Clinton Foundation everywhere?
[03:49:29.420 --> 03:49:34.420]   Seems like every time I bump into a lawsuit, somebody's associated with the Clinton Foundation.
[03:49:34.420 --> 03:49:37.420]   Yeah, you know what I'm talking about.
[03:49:37.420 --> 03:49:46.420]   All right, moving on here, I want to get this, because I know InfoWars spoke about this, and the coverage by InfoWars.
[03:49:46.420 --> 03:49:49.420]   If you're not listening to InfoWars and watching InfoWars, you're missing out.
[03:49:49.420 --> 03:49:56.420]   But I wanted to touch on this some more. How about this? Imran Awan. Remember him?
[03:49:56.420 --> 03:50:02.420]   Remember the Awan brothers? Why did we stop talking about that in the community?
[03:50:02.420 --> 03:50:12.420]   Of course, we didn't. We didn't, of course, but maybe you might ask Jim Acosta or one of his comrades, or did I say comrades?
[03:50:12.420 --> 03:50:16.420]   One of his associates about the Awan brothers.
[03:50:16.420 --> 03:50:30.420]   What I'm referring to is Imran Awan and the Awan family working for the Democrats in the House of Representatives for almost 13 years, making nearly six, I think six to seven million dollars.
[03:50:30.420 --> 03:50:58.420]   And of course, allegedly having a, not just involved in a procurement scam, but also apparently, in my view, in my professional opinion, operating a breach of the servers that perhaps, again, in my opinion, could have resulted in the transfer of classified information to Pakistan.
[03:50:58.420 --> 03:51:02.420]   But now we've got this. Are you ready for this? Are you sitting down?
[03:51:02.420 --> 03:51:14.420]   Reported by Zero Hedge and others. In fact, this was initially done through some videography and investigative reporting by CrowdSource of the Truth, Jason Goodman.
[03:51:14.420 --> 03:51:23.420]   It's an investigative journalist. Why does Imran Awan work at his Clinton-linked attorney's law firm?
[03:51:23.420 --> 03:51:33.420]   Did you hear that? Did you know that Imran Awan is working at his Clinton-linked attorney's law firm?
[03:51:33.420 --> 03:51:49.420]   A stunning video, a stunning video by investigative journalist Jason Goodman of CrowdSource of the Truth revealed that Pakistani IT worker Imran Awan is reportedly answering the phones, that's right, at the office of attorney Chris Gowan.
[03:51:49.420 --> 03:52:02.420]   And who is Chris Gowan? Gowan is a founding partner of Gowan Roads, Winograd, and Silva, with offices in D.C. and all over the planet. Well, D.C. and Philadelphia. Their planet, anyway.
[03:52:02.420 --> 03:52:11.420]   Now, it's interesting because, is this even ethical? Is this even, am I reading this right?
[03:52:11.420 --> 03:52:28.420]   He also served as, by the way, Chris Gowan's official bio on the firm's website notes that he left the public defender's office to work for former President William Clinton, and then Senator Hillary Clinton.
[03:52:28.420 --> 03:52:34.420]   There's Clinton again. Chris was a fact checker for President Clinton's memoir, My Life.
[03:52:34.420 --> 03:52:47.420]   He also served as a traveling aide for President Clinton's national and international trips. But, the issue here, in the video, and you can see this, you can see Jason Goodman walking up to the lawyer's office.
[03:52:47.420 --> 03:52:53.420]   You can be seen visiting the offices of Awan's attorney where he has to speak with the former house IT staffer.
[03:52:53.420 --> 03:53:02.420]   After his request was denied, Goodman said, "Hey, is Imran here?" To which the employee replied, "Uh, he is. Why?"
[03:53:02.420 --> 03:53:04.420]   [laughs]
[03:53:04.420 --> 03:53:08.420]   And Jason Goodman said, "Because it sounds like he's answering your phones."
[03:53:08.420 --> 03:53:11.420]   Which drew the retort, "Uh, what's your point?"
[03:53:11.420 --> 03:53:15.420]   "Well, you want a list of points there, counselor?"
[03:53:15.420 --> 03:53:22.420]   "Is he working for you?" asked Goodman, to which the employee whispers back, "Go away. Go away. We don't want you. Go away."
[03:53:22.420 --> 03:53:26.420]   Well, I might have embellished that a tad, but it's "Go away."
[03:53:26.420 --> 03:53:31.420]   And of course, there's Unzero Edge and Crowdsource of the Truth, there's a video.
[03:53:31.420 --> 03:53:58.420]   But notice, or note, that Awan, this, the Awan, the Awan scandal is not really a scandal, it's a crime. It was February 2nd of last year, when Imran Awan and his family, his Pakistani family, were prohibited, barred from the Capitol grounds on the basis of criminal, alleged criminal conduct.
[03:53:58.420 --> 03:54:09.420]   But yet, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, ah, she kept Imran Awan on in an advisory capacity until more recently.
[03:54:09.420 --> 03:54:11.420]   All right, so what's the deal with that?
[03:54:11.420 --> 03:54:35.420]   And of course, during that period of time, we have that interesting situation where the laptop of Imran Awan, and, or actually, the laptop of Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and some notes that said "attorney-client privilege" on it, and some other things like Awan's badge and ID card were found in this little cubby.
[03:54:35.420 --> 03:54:37.420]   And we've talked about this before.
[03:54:37.420 --> 03:54:46.420]   But we need to talk about it more and more. And the reason being is this overlaps into, believe it or not, what you will read from the email scandal.
[03:54:46.420 --> 03:54:50.420]   You might ask, "Wow, wait a minute, how is that? That seems like a stretch."
[03:54:50.420 --> 03:54:56.420]   Look, you've got the allegations of hacking by Russia.
[03:54:56.420 --> 03:54:59.420]   Bogus. Not true.
[03:54:59.420 --> 03:55:04.420]   You've got, what you have is the leaks from the DNC.
[03:55:04.420 --> 03:55:10.420]   You've got Hillary Clinton operating a homebrewed server in her house.
[03:55:10.420 --> 03:55:23.420]   But in addition to that, communicating with the President of the United States, also Weiner, and, or Ahuma Abedin, which the, at least 18 classified documents are found on Weiner's laptop.
[03:55:23.420 --> 03:55:31.420]   All of this stuff overlaps because all of this is classified information that's being mishandled in a criminal sense, in my view.
[03:55:31.420 --> 03:55:42.420]   And again, I couch that for those people who are transcribing this and want to, you know, go the lawsuit route some more.
[03:55:42.420 --> 03:55:57.420]   But we are exposing this criminality. We are exposing the overlap between the Awan criminal, in my view, infiltration into the Democratic Senate, or the Democratic House of Representatives.
[03:55:57.420 --> 03:56:06.420]   We are seeing the overlap of that and the Hillary Clinton email server, the mishandling of classified information.
[03:56:06.420 --> 03:56:22.420]   And now, to top it off, you've got Imran Awan, if you can believe it, working for Chris Gowen, allegedly, allegedly working for Chris Gowen, based on the fine work of Jason Goodman, "Crowd Service of the Truth," reported by Zero Hedge and other outlets.
[03:56:22.420 --> 03:56:24.420]   Why?
[03:56:24.420 --> 03:56:31.420]   Are we going to see justice? Are we going to see justice? Are we going to see anyone held accountable?
[03:56:31.420 --> 03:56:41.420]   And as I leave you this Friday, or this Thursday, I'm sorry, I'm getting the day ahead.
[03:56:41.420 --> 03:56:46.420]   As I leave you this Thursday, I'm going to ask a better question. What happens if we don't?
[03:56:46.420 --> 03:56:48.420]   What happens if we don't see justice?
[03:56:48.420 --> 03:56:50.420]   What happens if we don't see perp walks?
[03:56:50.420 --> 03:56:55.420]   What happens if we don't see people held to account?
[03:56:55.420 --> 03:56:58.420]   Will we see mass riots on the streets?
[03:56:58.420 --> 03:57:03.420]   Will the conservatives raise up and finally say, "We've had enough"?
[03:57:03.420 --> 03:57:05.420]   I leave you with that question.
[03:57:05.420 --> 03:57:14.420]   I think that we're reaching a time, I think we're reaching a point in our history where there will be a Lexington moment.
[03:57:14.420 --> 03:57:16.420]   There will be a moment, a flashpoint.
[03:57:16.420 --> 03:57:27.420]   And folks, when that flashpoint hits, all I can say is may God help us all and may God save our nation.
[03:57:27.420 --> 03:57:34.420]   I'm Doug Hagman, sitting in for Alex Jones. I want to thank you for listening, for keeping, for having me back.
