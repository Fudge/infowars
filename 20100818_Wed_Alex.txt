[00:41.440 --> 00:47.560]  coming up in 30 minutes from now on a host of issues the economy the buildup
[00:47.560 --> 00:52.960]  towards war with Iran will he run for president in 2012 we'll be discussing it
[00:52.960 --> 00:58.400]  all and the fact that Obama's approval ratings continue to exponentially plunge
[00:58.400 --> 01:04.040]  and we will be discussing it all coming up today let me go over just some of the
[01:04.040 --> 01:08.400]  stacks of news that I have here in front of me
[01:08.400 --> 01:14.640]  poll shows opposition to Iraq Afghanistan wars has reached all time high so
[01:14.640 --> 01:19.440]  they're getting ready to expand things into Iran and Pakistan speaking of Iran
[01:19.440 --> 01:24.880]  desperately seeking accommodation Iran offers us chance to build nuclear
[01:24.880 --> 01:33.080]  power plants so now Iran is offered to let Brazil do it or have the Turks do
[01:33.080 --> 01:36.840]  it or the French do it now they're saying okay America you can come in and do
[01:36.840 --> 01:42.320]  this we need this nuclear power we only have refineries for half the gasoline we
[01:42.320 --> 01:51.560]  need and instead of trying to put sanctions on us to where we can't you'll
[01:51.560 --> 01:56.400]  get the gasoline we need we also want to export oil crude oil we need these
[01:56.400 --> 02:01.120]  reactors so will you please come in and oversee the building of them so that you
[02:01.120 --> 02:05.880]  know they're peaceful and the answer is of course absolutely not that's not
[02:05.880 --> 02:11.960]  going to be put up with some really bad news here militarily Gulf states
[02:11.960 --> 02:18.240]  endorse military option against Iran the latest development in the never-ending
[02:18.240 --> 02:22.560]  saga of Iran comes via the Middle East Media Resource Institute which states
[02:22.560 --> 02:26.240]  that according to Gulf states the military option may be the best option to
[02:26.240 --> 02:32.200]  deal with the Iranian nuclear program as the Contra Iran no pun intended axis is
[02:32.200 --> 02:36.160]  now complete the article also reflected the Gulf states growing tension and
[02:36.160 --> 02:39.920]  concern regarding Iran's nuclear program and mentioned their proximity to the
[02:39.920 --> 02:43.320]  Bashir reactor because they're loading the fuel rods the next three days and
[02:43.320 --> 02:47.320]  then if it gets bombed it could be a Chernobyl type situation what is scary
[02:47.320 --> 02:51.920]  is that the straw man of military intervention is pretty much presented as
[02:51.920 --> 02:56.560]  a fake complete or an absolute certainty and alternatives to military
[02:56.560 --> 03:02.680]  intervention are not even considered and we've got Bahrain we've got Mumbai we've
[03:02.680 --> 03:08.240]  got Dubai excuse me we've got Saudi Arabia and many others coming out and
[03:08.240 --> 03:14.200]  saying that they want a military option with their starting to agree with a
[03:14.200 --> 03:18.240]  military option and you've got all this hype for a strike I mean this this is
[03:18.240 --> 03:22.800]  gonna be bad for the economy bad for the dead Iranians and Russian advisers
[03:22.800 --> 03:27.360]  that are gonna get killed bad for our country bad for the economy bad for our
[03:27.360 --> 03:31.920]  name we just cannot have another war we're going bankrupt and we've got
[03:31.920 --> 03:35.480]  these big global corporations that don't care if we go bankrupt because they
[03:35.480 --> 03:39.200]  loan us the money out of nothing that have dominated and taken control of our
[03:39.200 --> 03:45.600]  country and it's really just that simple and so the question here is as a
[03:45.600 --> 03:50.920]  society are we going to put up with this we'll talk more about that coming up on
[03:50.920 --> 03:57.760]  the economic front US says bankruptcies reach nearly five year high that's from
[03:57.760 --> 04:06.720]  CNBC here is a another report from USA Today and CNN Money 22 cities in
[04:06.720 --> 04:09.920]  danger of double-dip recession and the whole country is in a depression
[04:09.920 --> 04:15.000]  according to the economic benchmarks they used just two decades ago they've
[04:15.000 --> 04:18.360]  just changed the economic rules we had dr. Paul Craig Roberts on yesterday and
[04:18.360 --> 04:23.320]  he's written an editorial piece for info wars.com really a news piece breaking
[04:23.320 --> 04:27.000]  down how they cook the numbers so we'll be talking about that with Ron Paul as
[04:27.000 --> 04:32.440]  well also Tom Fenton saying why is Washington ignoring its biggest
[04:32.440 --> 04:37.880]  corruption scandal too few in Washington have been digging into the scandals
[04:37.880 --> 04:41.480]  by the collapse of the government-sponsored entities Fannie Mae and

[08:06.360 --> 08:11.960]  information war it's Alex Jones
[08:11.960 --> 08:28.000]  it is at Wednesday we are live the 18th day of August 2010 Congress from Ron Paul
[08:28.000 --> 08:32.920]  coming up in about 23 minutes from now this will be a key interview a whole
[08:32.920 --> 08:37.880]  host of important subjects will be able to get his report from Capitol Hill on
[08:37.880 --> 08:43.880]  so that is coming up and then remember pastor Steve Anderson about a year and a
[08:43.880 --> 08:48.960]  half ago he was driving through one of these checkpoints miles and miles in
[08:48.960 --> 08:53.240]  some cases a hundred miles into the United States and they wanted to search
[08:53.240 --> 08:59.240]  his car with no due process and he said no so they beat him up really bad well a
[08:59.240 --> 09:05.840]  court has thrown out the prosecution of the pastor so that is certainly good
[09:05.840 --> 09:11.720]  news and we've seen a lot of police brutality but also security guard
[09:11.720 --> 09:17.400]  brutality on the news the last few days and it's this tough guy attitude that
[09:17.400 --> 09:22.560]  police are being taught that of an old lady or an old man or a person in a
[09:22.560 --> 09:28.120]  wheelchair who's paralyzed from the neck down or a deaf person who's hearing and
[09:28.120 --> 09:33.840]  paired doesn't instantly respond doesn't instantly follow orders they can choke
[09:33.840 --> 09:40.680]  you beat you in the head with batons or Taser you and a lot of people are dying
[09:40.680 --> 09:45.720]  from this because they've got the police so hyped into this tough guy attitude
[09:45.720 --> 09:55.360]  via fear of the public that it's really creating an us against them scenario we
[09:55.360 --> 10:00.160]  don't want that in this country we want to educate the police we want to educate
[10:00.160 --> 10:05.720]  the military because in these type of systems as countries and societies
[10:05.720 --> 10:12.080]  become authoritarian the controllers count on their being division between
[10:12.080 --> 10:17.760]  the people and the enforcers we need to reach out to the enforcers you know
[10:17.760 --> 10:21.000]  there's a reason the mainstream media always runs with these police
[10:21.000 --> 10:28.640]  brutality stories and hypes them up that's done to create psychological
[10:28.640 --> 10:33.200]  division and you know many years ago I fell into this trap I'm against police
[10:33.200 --> 10:36.680]  brutality I'm against how they're trying to warp the police and turn them
[10:36.680 --> 10:41.480]  into thugs we talk about that but I would fall into the trap of at a
[10:41.480 --> 10:47.160]  primitive level feeling threatened by the police and then approaching it as an
[10:47.160 --> 10:53.800]  us against them mentality falling into the social controllers paradigm we need
[10:53.800 --> 10:59.240]  to decry out of control police behavior but at the same time we to point out
[10:59.240 --> 11:04.720]  they're being given this training and encouraged to do this by the federal
[11:04.720 --> 11:08.880]  government that is basically federalized most of the police departments in
[11:08.880 --> 11:12.880]  their funding and their training across the country so we're going to be
[11:12.880 --> 11:19.640]  discussing that some with pastor Steve Anderson coming up in the middle of the
[11:19.640 --> 11:26.560]  next hour of course we'll have nothing but wide open phones in the final hour
[11:26.560 --> 11:34.360]  as well today in miscellaneous news all of these reports illustrate the mind
[11:34.360 --> 11:38.560]  control going on in our society let me read a few of these headlines then go
[11:38.560 --> 11:45.400]  back through them crew takes baby slapped by mom aboard plane MSNBC
[11:45.400 --> 11:50.560]  Southwest flight attendant returned to infant before landing parents not
[11:50.560 --> 11:57.880]  charged well now the full stories come out the baby was crying 13 month old a
[11:57.880 --> 12:06.200]  little over a year and they heard a spat no one saw the slap on the baby's
[12:06.200 --> 12:11.680]  bottom now I think it's too young to spank a 13 month old by the time they're
[12:11.680 --> 12:16.040]  two they may occasionally need a little bit of that but mainly sternly talking
[12:16.040 --> 12:21.520]  to them will get their attention in in in my experience but if a child keeps
[12:21.520 --> 12:24.520]  trying to walk out in the street or keeps trying to turn the gas stove on
[12:24.520 --> 12:30.400]  they're gonna have to get in trouble but what the system does is it tells you
[12:30.400 --> 12:34.440]  the social engineers and they've written books on this tells you not to
[12:34.440 --> 12:37.840]  discipline your children even verbally there have been cases in the United
[12:37.840 --> 12:42.440]  States Canada and England as well as the EU where children are taken when
[12:42.440 --> 12:48.120]  their parents scream at them you idiot I told you don't go out in the street
[12:48.120 --> 12:54.640]  again I told you not to play in that space heater and they come and they take
[12:54.640 --> 12:57.240]  them they take them if you don't vaccinate your children even though
[12:57.240 --> 13:00.840]  there's no law they claim that shows a pattern of neglect even though there's
[13:00.840 --> 13:04.240]  no law to take the shot and the shots damaging the children and causing a
[13:04.240 --> 13:08.320]  tenfold increase in convulsions that's mainstream news just from the H1N1
[13:08.320 --> 13:14.200]  major brain damage major brain inflammation so see it's okay to put
[13:14.200 --> 13:21.160]  melamine in the milk and give them kidney failure in the formula it's okay
[13:21.160 --> 13:26.360]  to have most major plastics and receipts and printer ink having bisphenol a
[13:26.360 --> 13:34.320]  massively increasing breast cancer liver cancer and of course accelerating
[13:34.320 --> 13:39.480]  early onset of puberty in girls feminizing boys and delaying the onset
[13:39.480 --> 13:44.360]  of puberty and reducing fertility in boys accelerating fertility in girls for a
[13:44.360 --> 13:50.160]  brief time then resulting in reduced fertility and final sterilization this
[13:50.160 --> 13:55.080]  is all done by design that's okay the government pushing Gardasil that they
[13:55.080 --> 13:59.360]  admit doesn't even protect you from papillomavirus that can cause cervical
[13:59.360 --> 14:03.440]  cancer they admit on the drug insert doesn't protect you they try to make it
[14:03.440 --> 14:08.080]  mandatory it kills and maims a bunch of people that's loving girls going into
[14:08.080 --> 14:12.280]  puberty by the tens of thousands every year at the age of three or four or five
[14:12.280 --> 14:19.920]  by the hundreds of thousands at the age of seven or eight that's not abuse no
[14:19.920 --> 14:25.560]  some ignorant parent being pressured to make their baby stop crying spatting the
[14:25.560 --> 14:32.280]  13-month-old you know this parents ignorant but they're a parent and
[14:32.280 --> 14:38.280]  that's not abuse the law says it's not abuse unless you cause harm but instead
[14:38.280 --> 14:43.480]  they train people not to show children boundaries not to discipline children if
[14:43.480 --> 14:48.280]  you send a child to bed without their dinner if they're throwing fits or being
[14:48.280 --> 14:52.680]  bad which is a good form of punishment historically to really get their
[14:52.680 --> 14:57.640]  attention that's now a form of abuse if you take your 10-year-old to church and
[14:57.640 --> 15:01.480]  they say they don't want to go that's a form of abuse if you don't want your
[15:01.480 --> 15:05.840]  six-year-old being taught sex education and how to have sex with people with
[15:05.840 --> 15:09.760]  statistic shows makes them more permixed promiscuous just like suicide
[15:09.760 --> 15:13.920]  education causes more suicide it puts the idea in their heads they can take your
[15:13.920 --> 15:17.960]  children if you tell your children don't trust the government they can take them
[15:17.960 --> 15:21.600]  in the case of Barry Cooper and his son here in central Texas with Williamson
[15:21.600 --> 15:28.160]  County this is real this is happening this is going on and the system is
[15:28.160 --> 15:32.720]  trying to train everyone to just give your children up to the state when they
[15:32.720 --> 15:36.680]  say I mean can you imagine being this woman it turns out the media spun it
[15:36.680 --> 15:41.200]  like she slapped the baby in the face and now it's being reported that she
[15:41.200 --> 15:45.760]  spattered the baby on the bottom and no one even saw that they suspected it but
[15:45.760 --> 15:50.000]  that's what the woman said that she did now how many cases have you seen where
[15:50.000 --> 15:53.920]  the flight attendants demand that mothers and fathers give their child
[15:53.920 --> 15:58.160]  benadryl to make them go to sleep even though it's not doctor-approved and
[15:58.160 --> 16:02.360]  recommended until after three years of age how many times have there been issues
[16:02.360 --> 16:07.240]  over that and the media is defended drugging the child what is CPS do with
[16:07.240 --> 16:13.520]  children as young as one year of age they put them on lithium a deadly
[16:13.520 --> 16:20.040]  antipsychotic metal that toxifies the brain they put them on Prozac type drugs
[16:20.040 --> 16:26.360]  they are putting masses of children younger than one year of age on these
[16:26.360 --> 16:31.760]  drugs when CPS takes a baby and the toddler starts crying and throwing fits
[16:31.760 --> 16:37.640]  and being bad they put them on hardcore antipsychotics now what's more abusive
[16:37.640 --> 16:42.240]  when a two-year-old keeps trying to open the fence in the backyard and go out and
[16:42.240 --> 16:46.400]  play in oncoming traffic spatting them on the hind end the third time they don't
[16:46.400 --> 16:51.360]  listen and rebelliously puff up their cheeks and you know act like little
[16:51.360 --> 16:55.920]  dictators spatting them like you do a puppy with a rolled-up newspaper to let
[16:55.920 --> 16:59.560]  them know who's boss it's all dog training humans are very similar to dogs
[16:59.560 --> 17:03.880]  you study the globalist brainwashing through Pavlovian conditioning with the
[17:03.880 --> 17:08.280]  school bells and all the training they know what they're doing and they know
[17:08.280 --> 17:13.360]  you spat a puppy when it pees on the floor and doesn't go outside or doesn't
[17:13.360 --> 17:19.120]  pee on the newspapers you spat them on the hind end with the newspaper it's
[17:19.120 --> 17:23.400]  psychological it doesn't hurt the puppy they know that's the same thing for
[17:23.400 --> 17:28.960]  toddlers and they know that once society falls apart order out of chaos that
[17:28.960 --> 17:33.520]  once you have a generation of spoiled brats I see people all the time when I'm
[17:33.520 --> 17:38.080]  at the grocery store with some three or four or five or even ten-year-olds in
[17:38.080 --> 17:43.400]  some cases throwing fits screaming I have I was in target two weeks ago
[17:43.400 --> 17:48.440]  buying a mask and snorkel for an open lake swim I was gonna do and I saw what
[17:48.440 --> 17:53.800]  looked like a seven-year-old the woman had three sons come over and punch his
[17:53.800 --> 17:58.160]  mother and look at her like he wanted to attack her well let me tell you
[17:58.160 --> 18:03.000]  something I seven-year-old did that they wouldn't be doing it again nobody's
[18:03.000 --> 18:07.280]  gonna hit my wife and that's what happens what the Bible talks about how
[18:07.280 --> 18:13.280]  your sons and daughters will be over you this is how society falls apart this is
[18:13.280 --> 18:17.760]  how society degenerates and they don't learn their boundaries then they get
[18:17.760 --> 18:24.600]  put into public school and then they punch the teacher or they punch the
[18:24.600 --> 18:29.520]  security guard and they're disrespectful and they get arrested and tasered and
[18:29.520 --> 18:34.280]  get taken to juvie hall where they get raped and then when they complain they
[18:34.280 --> 18:39.520]  get put on drugs this is the system and the system knows exactly what they're
[18:39.520 --> 18:42.660]  doing let me tell you something when I was in high school I was pretty good the
[18:42.660 --> 18:47.480]  last few years I was pretty bad the first few fighting you know skipping
[18:47.480 --> 18:51.240]  school you know to take my girlfriend out things like that but let me tell
[18:51.240 --> 18:56.040]  you something what got me in line was the coaches taking me out making me run
[18:56.040 --> 18:59.720]  around the football field till I threw up and then taking me in and giving me
[18:59.720 --> 19:03.520]  three or four pops and I mean with the big old paddle and let me tell you
[19:03.520 --> 19:07.880]  something I may have been 13 years old and pretty tough but I was did not like
[19:07.880 --> 19:13.200]  having my hind in with purple stripes across it and I didn't like in fact I'd
[19:13.200 --> 19:17.880]  beg for those pops instead of being run till I threw up and let me tell you
[19:17.880 --> 19:22.360]  that's what America needs and that's what needs to happen in this country
[19:22.360 --> 19:28.600]  people it's a lot better to be run till you throw up and to be given pops than
[19:28.600 --> 19:33.480]  to have the police come and taser you with 50,000 volts that can kill you and
[19:33.480 --> 19:38.880]  take you to jail so see should we spank children or let the state take them and
[19:38.880 --> 19:44.640]  put them on anti-psychotics when they're bad was irrevocably hurts them you
[19:44.640 --> 19:47.400]  know that which does not kill you only makes you stronger unless it's these
[19:47.400 --> 19:53.520]  chemical lobotomies should we let them principles give licks and run people till
[19:53.520 --> 19:57.960]  they throw up or send people to juvenile hall you make the decision America

[23:51.960 --> 23:59.000]  Lipscomb and my company is survivalistseeds.com
[24:04.760 --> 24:12.640]  I hear the train come it's rolling around the bed and I see the sunshine I
[24:12.640 --> 24:19.680]  don't know when I'm stuck in prison and time keeps dragging on
[24:19.680 --> 24:27.880]  jaren one of our producers made a good point during the break and that was if
[24:27.880 --> 24:31.440]  you see somebody driving 80 miles an hour down the road and they pull over in a
[24:31.440 --> 24:35.240]  gas station and they've got children in the back you just can't grab their
[24:35.240 --> 24:39.760]  children away from them that's kidnapping well this woman wasn't even seen
[24:39.760 --> 24:45.560]  spatting her child but somebody heard the spat and so the flight attendant
[24:45.560 --> 24:52.560]  jerked the child away and made a big scene and I'll go back to it they force
[24:52.560 --> 24:57.120]  vaccines on children that we know are brain damaging them sterilizing them
[24:57.120 --> 25:02.480]  reducing fertility causing all these problems increases in cancer killing them
[25:02.480 --> 25:11.280]  in many cases and that's okay we have children at age three going into puberty
[25:11.280 --> 25:15.240]  little girls we have little boys having their puberty delayed because they're
[25:15.240 --> 25:19.280]  being given female hormones the little girls go into puberty early because of
[25:19.280 --> 25:23.360]  it has the opposite effect that's incredible abuse and where's the move
[25:23.360 --> 25:27.760]  to get by Sphenol a out of all these plastic products that contain juice
[25:27.760 --> 25:35.720]  drinks and food and everything else the system with no evidence and without due
[25:35.720 --> 25:41.520]  process with these family courts is waging war against the family and going
[25:41.520 --> 25:49.920]  after people's children over and over and over and over again and the media
[25:49.920 --> 25:54.120]  spun this like oh my gosh you know this mother was like the Taliban or
[25:54.120 --> 25:58.640]  something we've got to do something and I do think a 13 month old is too young
[25:58.640 --> 26:05.560]  to spat doesn't have any effect but the issue here is that they're hyping this
[26:05.560 --> 26:12.480]  up as a major story and spun it as if she slapped the baby in the face and then
[26:12.480 --> 26:15.960]  you go back to the public schools where they won't discipline the children and
[26:15.960 --> 26:21.360]  now discipline has disintegrated and it's a war zone and their answer is turn the
[26:21.360 --> 26:29.320]  schools in to literal prisons ladies and gentlemen now before I get into some
[26:29.320 --> 26:33.640]  other news dealing with the border I wanted to tell you that Jesse Ventura

[32:05.680 --> 32:09.400]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our
[32:09.400 --> 32:13.360]  new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[32:13.360 --> 32:17.760]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[32:17.760 --> 32:22.200]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[32:22.200 --> 32:26.960]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[32:26.960 --> 32:30.760]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[32:30.760 --> 32:34.360]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[32:34.360 --> 32:38.680]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[33:09.320 --> 33:13.480]  ladies and gentlemen until the end of the hour we're joined by congressman
[33:13.480 --> 33:19.560]  Ron Paul Dr. Paul of course his son is still got a healthy lead against the
[33:19.560 --> 33:23.120]  Democratic candidate there in Kentucky and needs your support we'll talk a
[33:23.120 --> 33:27.680]  little bit about the hoaxes there's five of them we've counted that have been
[33:27.680 --> 33:32.960]  run but we're mainly going to focus on the Iran situation the economy and so
[33:32.960 --> 33:37.440]  much more congressman thank you for joining us good to be with you so much
[33:37.440 --> 33:41.120]  is happening and you're always nice to join us each month I've got all my
[33:41.120 --> 33:45.640]  questions but for for you congressman what is most important on your radar
[33:45.640 --> 33:50.280]  right now you'd like to talk about well I don't think anything is new I keep
[33:50.280 --> 33:53.880]  talking about the same issue the bold and broad issue of course is liberty and
[33:53.880 --> 33:58.880]  then I deal so much in the foreign policy we don't talk enough about foreign
[33:58.880 --> 34:02.320]  policy they are talking about domestic policy and the debt and that's very good
[34:02.320 --> 34:06.040]  and that's what the election seems to be about but according to the polls they
[34:06.040 --> 34:09.840]  say that nobody cares about these wars but I have a little trouble believing
[34:09.840 --> 34:14.600]  that because it shouldn't take much of a leap for people to understand that
[34:14.600 --> 34:20.000]  running an empire and spending all this money is very detrimental to our
[34:20.000 --> 34:24.640]  economy so that's high on my agenda and of course the economic situation and
[34:24.640 --> 34:29.560]  how they're making it much worse hopefully I can get as much interest in
[34:29.560 --> 34:34.040]  trying to allow people to opt out of the system with competing currencies ago
[34:34.040 --> 34:39.080]  I think we're getting much closer to a currency crisis and if people would only
[34:39.080 --> 34:43.640]  have that option to get out and it's encouraging news to know that the
[34:43.640 --> 34:47.280]  Indonesians are now looking toward hard money and maybe we'll put some pressure
[34:47.280 --> 34:52.280]  on Western nations as well because if we went to hard money or a hard money back
[34:52.280 --> 34:57.240]  currency that would take the power away from the central banks to basically
[34:57.240 --> 35:01.400]  build up their power at the expense of the real free market yeah that's right
[35:01.400 --> 35:05.480]  I don't think you have to by force be able to have the political power to go
[35:05.480 --> 35:09.040]  in and close down the Fed that's not going to happen soon but they can self
[35:09.040 --> 35:12.960]  destruct what we have to do is educate people to know what the other
[35:12.960 --> 35:18.240]  alternative is and an option to do it that's why I really fear it when people
[35:18.240 --> 35:23.280]  try to use constitutional money silver and gold coins you know they they can
[35:23.280 --> 35:28.960]  end up in prison or harassed at death or find it out and yet that is that is the
[35:28.960 --> 35:33.320]  answer why should they fear it they fear it because they want power and the
[35:33.320 --> 35:38.120]  power the special interest have power when they can print the money control it
[35:38.120 --> 35:43.240]  and and make sure that people suffer the consequence of the inflation congressman
[35:43.240 --> 35:50.360]  looking at foreign policy you've talked about sanctions on Iran being an act of
[35:50.360 --> 35:55.760]  war under international law and our own law and now we've got Bolton the former
[35:55.760 --> 35:59.680]  ambassador from the United States of the UN saying we've got to hit them by the
[35:59.680 --> 36:04.000]  21st that's just three days away or they're gonna fuel the reactor we've
[36:04.000 --> 36:09.400]  got the Gulf States lining up now in support of an attack on Iran our
[36:09.400 --> 36:12.920]  government had lied the last three years and said we don't have contractors or
[36:12.920 --> 36:18.560]  troops in Pakistan they now admit that they are there they're now trying to
[36:18.560 --> 36:24.200]  to to hype up an increase conflict not just with Iran but Pakistan can you
[36:24.200 --> 36:30.880]  speak directly to the war clouds that are gathering over Iran and Pakistan
[36:30.880 --> 36:37.600]  yeah I mean there's a lot in the neocon camp that's all they agitate for they
[36:37.600 --> 36:42.960]  think that's the only solution for the mess that actually the West has created
[36:42.960 --> 36:48.160]  the European as well as the West including us have created this mess and
[36:48.160 --> 36:53.360]  they're determined to you know move in that direction I keep you know hoping
[36:53.360 --> 36:57.040]  and praying that they're not successful and they're not about to be so stupid as
[36:57.040 --> 37:02.960]  to bomb Iran but they're liable to and that is going to be a major major
[37:02.960 --> 37:06.840]  catastrophe and then I think the argument is still going on I don't think the
[37:06.840 --> 37:11.120]  plans have been laid I I doubt if it'll happen the next three days or next month
[37:11.120 --> 37:15.880]  for that matter but that doesn't mean the issue is going to go away do you agree
[37:15.880 --> 37:21.040]  that we're moving towards a green lighting because many of the experts we
[37:21.040 --> 37:27.920]  interview concur that that the war drums are intensifying and that the
[37:27.920 --> 37:34.160]  propaganda mechanisms the very same neocons that promoted fictional WMDs in
[37:34.160 --> 37:42.840]  Iraq in 2002 2003 are right back at it well I don't know that answer because
[37:42.840 --> 37:46.760]  I'm not on the inside I still think there's some disagreements going on and
[37:46.760 --> 37:51.560]  it's not if it had been if they had been unified on this bush would have done it
[37:51.560 --> 37:56.240]  so obviously there's two arguments even among the the radical neocons and the
[37:56.240 --> 38:00.040]  other ones are that are less radical I think it's I think it's still going on
[38:00.040 --> 38:05.600]  and I think reality sets in to there has to be some military people who are
[38:05.600 --> 38:10.200]  really worried about this they you know what are they gonna fight a war with what
[38:10.200 --> 38:16.040]  happens you know they had these war games where they try you know the
[38:16.040 --> 38:20.120]  theoretically and bombed Iran and then the consequence was it would be a
[38:20.120 --> 38:24.280]  disaster for us so there's military people arguing against this as well so
[38:24.280 --> 38:28.080]  some of the outrageous politicians are arguing go ahead and go in and bomb
[38:28.080 --> 38:32.960]  other people who have a little bit more common sense economic conditions are
[38:32.960 --> 38:36.800]  such that where they're gonna get the troops and where they're gonna get the
[38:36.800 --> 38:41.200]  money and that's you know that's all we need right now is more of this so I
[38:41.200 --> 38:44.920]  think the debate is still going on and I certainly don't have the answer on
[38:44.920 --> 38:49.240]  exactly when but I know there's a lot of people there who would like to do it
[38:49.240 --> 38:52.840]  people like Bolton they're gonna agitate and agitate until they have their way
[38:52.840 --> 38:57.920]  hopefully they don't win this fight well Jeffrey Goldberg of the Atlantic who
[38:57.920 --> 39:02.440]  pushed some of the key disinfo on Iraqi WMD's he's back and they're putting him
[39:02.440 --> 39:08.680]  on television and he's writing for the new Atlantic but at the same time I
[39:08.680 --> 39:13.080]  three weeks ago saw the Financial Times of London with top Clinton advisor and
[39:13.080 --> 39:18.640]  also Obama advisor Robert Shapiro saying quote if we don't have another
[39:18.640 --> 39:23.920]  Oklahoma City or 9-11 to make Obama look strong we're going to probably lose
[39:23.920 --> 39:28.520]  the House and the Senate and then now other neocons are openly writing
[39:28.520 --> 39:34.280]  articles saying Obama attack Iran will back you you'll get political support so
[39:34.280 --> 39:39.960]  a lot of people I'm talking to and are really concerned that Obama may back in
[39:39.960 --> 39:44.880]  Israeli strike or even a US strike in the short term to have the people rally
[39:44.880 --> 39:50.600]  around him as some type of October surprise well I guess it's a
[39:50.600 --> 39:55.320]  possibility but like I said I I don't know the answer to that I think our job
[39:55.320 --> 40:01.320]  is to point out the great dangers and at least you know explain to many of our
[40:01.320 --> 40:05.480]  friends in the conservative movement that you know the typical conservative
[40:05.480 --> 40:09.920]  should be endorsing illegal inconstitutional wars of aggression and
[40:09.920 --> 40:15.800]  that I think that should be our job and I just can't say that I can either
[40:15.800 --> 40:20.200]  alter the future nor know the future but I do know what our obligations ought to
[40:20.200 --> 40:26.880]  be looking at the economy many economists are saying we're really in a
[40:26.880 --> 40:31.600]  depression if you look at the old standards of economic analysis but
[40:31.600 --> 40:36.200]  that there's a lot of cooking in the books now now the mainstream media is
[40:36.200 --> 40:41.240]  saying okay it's a double-dip recession they're talking about the Federal
[40:41.240 --> 40:45.640]  Reserve you're putting out trillions of more dollars the taxpayers will have to
[40:45.640 --> 40:50.200]  pay back congressman Paul studying the economy and being a very accurate and
[40:50.200 --> 40:55.040]  predicting what happened in 2008 and that the stimulus would not work in the
[40:55.040 --> 41:00.280]  last year and a half what is your economic prognosis for the United States
[41:00.280 --> 41:05.480]  well I don't talk about double-dips because I don't think the economy ever
[41:05.480 --> 41:09.280]  really recovered everything that said the economy was recovering were
[41:09.280 --> 41:12.600]  artificial statistics coming from the government let's say they give a
[41:12.600 --> 41:17.400]  tremendous tax credit for somebody to refinance their house or buy a house and
[41:17.400 --> 41:21.520]  then there's a little blip upwards they spend a couple trillion dollars and that
[41:21.520 --> 41:26.000]  translates into a hundred billion dollars or so of GDP increase I mean what
[41:26.000 --> 41:31.800]  does that mean the cost was 10 times more than the GDP increase so they talk
[41:31.800 --> 41:36.440]  about a recovery a weak recovery and now there's going to be a double-dip I
[41:36.440 --> 41:41.720]  think if we were honest with ourselves we would say we started slipping nearly
[41:41.720 --> 41:46.320]  10 years ago in a year 2000 when the Nasdaq bubble collapsed good jobs went
[41:46.320 --> 41:51.000]  overseas we've lost the jobs that never came back over that whole decade things
[41:51.000 --> 41:55.880]  got much much worse after the last crisis here in 2008 and I think it's a
[41:55.880 --> 42:01.280]  continuation of downhill for us and since they're doing all the same things
[42:01.280 --> 42:05.560]  that they did to put us into this crisis we can expect this economy to give
[42:05.560 --> 42:10.200]  out much worse the American people are going to be a lot poorer and they're
[42:10.200 --> 42:15.200]  only going to have the printing press to look to they're going to keep printing
[42:15.200 --> 42:19.440]  money and that's going to precipitate the dollar crisis and that'll be a
[42:19.440 --> 42:24.040]  political crisis that's when we better have our ducks lined up so that we know
[42:24.040 --> 42:28.240]  you have enough allies to replace the system we have today with a
[42:28.240 --> 42:32.400]  constitutional system sound money free markets private property rights all the
[42:32.400 --> 42:38.480]  things that we believe in but that that is that is coming but once again you
[42:38.480 --> 42:42.760]  don't know when now we were just talking about the Iranian situation if next
[42:42.760 --> 42:47.800]  week they go ahead and and bomb Iran and the oil prices double or triple and one
[42:47.800 --> 42:52.760]  of our ships get sunk that war would spread rather quickly that would be a
[42:52.760 --> 42:58.080]  whole new ball game and may be what would collapse the dollar I know you
[42:58.080 --> 43:01.760]  don't like people to you know to talk about how great you are congressman but
[43:01.760 --> 43:07.040]  you really are a true statesman a medical doctor someone who's been given
[43:07.040 --> 43:13.080]  honorary degrees for your understanding of economics and yourself judge Andrew
[43:13.080 --> 43:17.000]  Napolitano and many others in the last eight months have come on this show
[43:17.000 --> 43:22.600]  repeatedly and I read the bill as well on air the financial reform bill allows
[43:22.600 --> 43:29.680]  the SEC to have secrecy autonomy cannot be investigated for covering up for made
[43:29.680 --> 43:34.040]  off for ten years it allows this private board of the Federal Reserve to have
[43:34.040 --> 43:40.880]  more power over the economy in their 97 years of looting as a front group for
[43:40.880 --> 43:44.840]  private banks and and now that's all come true so I'd like you to speak to
[43:44.840 --> 43:50.080]  that a but then B you also read the different versions of the health care
[43:50.080 --> 43:56.480]  bill and said this raises taxes cuts benefits it does allow the government
[43:56.480 --> 44:01.800]  to come in and set parameters on what type of care people will get and the
[44:01.800 --> 44:05.840]  the the Democrats and Republican leadership they stonewalled on this and
[44:05.840 --> 44:10.160]  said none of that was true now everything you said six months ago on the
[44:10.160 --> 44:15.040]  show is admitted they're coming out and admitting okay this doesn't cover pre
[44:15.040 --> 44:18.680]  existing conditions it's a tax increase and the insurance companies wrote it to
[44:18.680 --> 44:23.240]  rip you off as a bailout okay it's true this gives the Federal Reserve even more
[44:23.240 --> 44:26.840]  power and more junk bonds are being issued and record derivatives are being
[44:26.840 --> 44:30.800]  issued I mean it's clear they're accelerating all this over the edge of
[44:30.800 --> 44:35.080]  the cliff so so I mean you you've been proven right again I mean it's so
[44:35.080 --> 44:39.920]  incredible how criminal this is I guess it's better late than never you know
[44:39.920 --> 44:43.760]  people are starting to read it and find out I think the most atrocious statement
[44:43.760 --> 44:48.320]  came from Nancy Pelosi when she says well when people were arguing what we need
[44:48.320 --> 44:51.800]  to see the bill and study this she says something like well we need to pass the
[44:51.800 --> 44:56.840]  bill so we can read it and that's the boy the inner statement of the century
[44:56.840 --> 45:03.840]  because that's exactly what happens and even as hard as my staff works every
[45:03.840 --> 45:08.800]  little comma and every little phrase it is pretty tough to dissect all of that
[45:08.800 --> 45:14.280]  that's why the whole process is so bad but I protect myself of I against ever
[45:14.280 --> 45:18.200]  endorsing that because it doesn't take long to find out they're what they're
[45:18.200 --> 45:23.000]  goals are and what their intent is making government bigger raising more
[45:23.000 --> 45:31.000]  taxes but even even as bad as it is it's it's even worse than some people think
[45:31.000 --> 45:35.720]  Barney Frank is a big regulator he loves his stuff and I work with him on some
[45:35.720 --> 45:42.120]  issues but obviously on this regulatory bill I did not and he I believe was
[45:42.120 --> 45:47.840]  honestly surprised about how much more power was given to the SEC because he
[45:47.840 --> 45:52.280]  has a he has a sort of an instinct of more transparency and he actually wants
[45:52.280 --> 45:56.960]  to do something about that and he is probably the most informed person about
[45:56.960 --> 46:00.560]  that bill as it was going through I'm amazed at how much deep potato he knows
[46:00.560 --> 46:05.400]  but he can't possibly know every single thing that's there and the SEC does
[46:05.400 --> 46:10.840]  behind the scenes it sticks this stuff in at the last minute and it's just
[46:10.840 --> 46:15.160]  absolutely out of control and that's why this system will end it has to be
[46:15.160 --> 46:18.880]  replaced by something else again Congressman Ron Paul joins us remember
[46:18.880 --> 46:24.800]  what a month and a half ago Senator DeMint got up and reported that 94% of
[46:24.800 --> 46:32.040]  the Senate bills are never even read and are literally written by the special
[46:32.040 --> 46:35.920]  interest lobbyists many of them foreign lobbyists this is a foreign corporate
[46:35.920 --> 46:39.320]  takeover of our government if the president can launch wars without
[46:39.320 --> 46:42.760]  Congress declaring it the private central banks can issue all this fiat
[46:42.760 --> 46:48.000]  currency to their enrichment and our detriment but he said in his speech he
[46:48.000 --> 46:53.360]  didn't know the number on the house do we have any idea of what number of house
[46:53.360 --> 46:57.320]  bills are never even read and are brought out 30 minutes before they're
[46:57.320 --> 47:03.400]  passed not exactly the big question the big problem would be that some of those
[47:03.400 --> 47:08.360]  bills float around and you can read them but when the night before they're due to
[47:08.360 --> 47:11.360]  come to the floor they go to the rules committee and the rules committee has
[47:11.360 --> 47:15.960]  tremendous license to change things the chairman of the rules committee can have
[47:15.960 --> 47:21.120]  a manager's amendment which was used originally to change some grammatical
[47:21.120 --> 47:25.760]  things and technique you know just a few technical things technical changes but
[47:25.760 --> 47:29.640]  now they use the manager's amendment to replace the whole bill that's what they
[47:29.640 --> 47:34.800]  did with the Patriot Act they you know Bob Barr and others tried to protect us
[47:34.800 --> 47:38.440]  to a degree you know against the Patriot Act he worked months on or at least
[47:38.440 --> 47:42.200]  several weeks on that but when the manager's amendment came from the rules
[47:42.200 --> 47:47.160]  committee they put the whole new bill into it which may meant that nobody
[47:47.160 --> 47:52.120]  could read it so it depends on on the particular issue but even if the bills
[47:52.120 --> 47:57.560]  available the financial reform bill was available and discussed in a lot of
[47:57.560 --> 48:02.000]  hearings and a lot of talk but that still doesn't mean that many members would
[48:02.000 --> 48:06.640]  have had a total comprehension and been able to read this bill it is so massive
[48:06.640 --> 48:11.680]  so I would say that if you're talking about how often all the members read
[48:11.680 --> 48:18.200]  everything is being presented I I would think that it's less than 5% where
[48:18.200 --> 48:21.040]  people can say oh I've read the whole bill and I fully understand that that
[48:21.040 --> 48:25.400]  just very rarely happens and that's why you're known as Dr. No and they tried to
[48:25.400 --> 48:29.680]  criticize you because if you can't read some 3,000 page bill and they give it to
[48:29.680 --> 48:34.240]  you an hour before it's time to vote it would be immoral for you to pass it now
[48:34.240 --> 48:37.720]  that should that should be an easy note for everybody and hopefully what's going
[48:37.720 --> 48:42.600]  on in this country it'll get easier because the American people are sick
[48:42.600 --> 48:46.400]  and tired of this I mean sometimes they just they just say why don't you guys
[48:46.400 --> 48:49.800]  read the bills why don't we do anything else let's have a let's have a delayed
[48:49.800 --> 48:55.920]  time read the bills but that I think it's good that the American people are
[48:55.920 --> 49:00.840]  getting very upset with the status quo and I think they're wise enough now to
[49:00.840 --> 49:04.680]  be very cautious about saying well if we just elect the Republicans they'll take
[49:04.680 --> 49:08.920]  care of it so this is a Republican versus Democrat issue it isn't it's the
[49:08.920 --> 49:13.400]  people who believe in big government and big taxes and a lot of war and welfare
[49:13.400 --> 49:17.280]  against the people who have to pay all the bills and all they want is to be
[49:17.280 --> 49:21.840]  left alone congressmen even establishment political analysts as you
[49:21.840 --> 49:24.840]  know admit there's been one of the biggest political realignments in
[49:24.840 --> 49:29.880]  history against the Democrats and the Republicans almost every pro-establishment
[49:29.880 --> 49:35.240]  candidate whether they be Democrat or Republican are losing in the primaries
[49:35.240 --> 49:40.360]  and and great patriots like your son dr. Rand Paul are winning that's got the
[49:40.360 --> 49:46.880]  system panicked and the Daily Paul ran a story yesterday says Ron Paul to run
[49:46.880 --> 49:53.360]  for president in 2012 will announce in January 2011 you know I don't have any
[49:53.360 --> 49:57.520]  inside knowledge but knowing you you understand you'll be able to inject real
[49:57.520 --> 50:01.560]  issues in the debate you know your health is good and of course it's great
[50:01.560 --> 50:06.120]  right now I mean I would imagine being a man of honor you know you're going to
[50:06.120 --> 50:12.120]  run but this has some supposed inside official whose unnamed saying you've
[50:12.120 --> 50:16.640]  decided to announce in January of 2011 congressmen I would be remiss if I didn't
[50:16.640 --> 50:19.920]  bring this up to you well I don't know where they got that they didn't get it
[50:19.920 --> 50:26.600]  from me and the truth is what I've been saying for many many months I haven't
[50:26.600 --> 50:31.880]  decided to run I haven't decided not to run and it will have obviously not be
[50:31.880 --> 50:37.600]  now or linked it would not be this year and it'll depend a lot on what I
[50:37.600 --> 50:41.400]  perceive as support you know a lot of people a lot of people like what I'm
[50:41.400 --> 50:44.800]  doing and they encourage me but there are some that say well it's time for you
[50:44.800 --> 50:48.600]  to take a rest somebody else about to do it you know that sort of thing so I need
[50:48.600 --> 50:53.240]  to know you know the support is really out there but certainly I gave no
[50:53.240 --> 50:58.120]  inside information just recently at Orlando as was reported but I would
[50:58.120 --> 51:02.600]  imagine if Rand does win and people support him that's going to be a big
[51:02.600 --> 51:07.560]  plus for you running for president yeah I think this this is all a benefit of
[51:07.560 --> 51:12.360]  what's happening to show that the status quo is something that needs to be
[51:12.360 --> 51:17.600]  changed whether it's Rand's race or or others I think it's all very positive
[51:17.600 --> 51:22.520]  when your son said I've got a message to Washington the Tea Party's coming no to
[51:22.520 --> 51:27.480]  your carbon tax no to your elitism no to your globalism it's scared them so
[51:27.480 --> 51:31.320]  they've run five hoaxes they they claim do you want to get rid of the Civil
[51:31.320 --> 51:34.960]  Rights Act when he said excuse me I can't hear you yes no I don't want to get
[51:34.960 --> 51:38.440]  rid of it they claimed he wasn't a doctor complete hoax they claim they have
[51:38.440 --> 51:42.920]  been caught if this is mainstream news sending people from the Democratic Party
[51:42.920 --> 51:47.760]  to pose as racist supporters of Rand they then even three days after that lady
[51:47.760 --> 51:53.080]  admitted that nobody tied her up nobody made her take bong hits you know none of
[51:53.080 --> 51:58.360]  this happened still no retractions from GQ no retractions from Huffington Post
[51:58.360 --> 52:02.520]  they're still going with it my listeners made Rand Paul hoax the number one
[52:02.520 --> 52:07.080]  search term last Friday and hundreds of publications read our breakdown saw that
[52:07.080 --> 52:11.800]  she retracted in the Washington Post and so now it's it's out there that was a
[52:11.800 --> 52:16.640]  hoax but I'm worried if he doesn't sue them or at least stand up to them next
[52:16.640 --> 52:20.680]  they'll say he killed Kennedy next they'll say he killed Jesus next they'll
[52:20.680 --> 52:26.280]  say that he burned the Reichstag next he'll say that you know he let the cows
[52:26.280 --> 52:30.480]  out of the gate I mean next he'll say he he's causing the wildfires in Russia I
[52:30.480 --> 52:34.480]  mean there's no end to how desperate they are I'm really worried about your
[52:34.480 --> 52:38.000]  son well there's a couple ways you can handle that I do think you have to
[52:38.000 --> 52:41.600]  answer back you just can't let it think sitting out there but you can't get
[52:41.600 --> 52:46.600]  overly defensive or it gives them too much credibility and I've been under
[52:46.600 --> 52:51.680]  those attacks too because you know and I'm sure you share my views about how
[52:51.680 --> 52:55.600]  outrageous the war on drugs is and how that violates our civil liberties so I've
[52:55.600 --> 53:00.480]  never supported the war on drugs yet I detest the use of of drugs for kids and
[53:00.480 --> 53:06.560]  all that but they use that against me in 96 and I put a TV ad on and I defended
[53:06.560 --> 53:12.080]  myself and explain why it's the war on drugs not the drugs that I promote and I
[53:12.080 --> 53:16.520]  think the other thing that we did that is so important is to try to get it
[53:16.520 --> 53:21.680]  image out there the more I see I can say a lot of things that might be
[53:21.680 --> 53:25.360]  controversial but by this time the people in Texas and people in my
[53:25.360 --> 53:30.000]  district know me and they trust me and then when they say oh Ron Paul wants to
[53:30.000 --> 53:34.000]  give kids drugs nobody believes that stuff you know like all these things
[53:34.000 --> 53:38.760]  you're suggesting he's gonna believe that the more people know ran so when
[53:38.760 --> 53:43.280]  they get to know him and see him as a physician with kids last night I talked
[53:43.280 --> 53:47.040]  him on the phone which is rather rare and he he was out of the soccer game with
[53:47.040 --> 53:52.640]  his kids you know so if that's if they see that I told him I said what you need
[53:52.640 --> 53:56.880]  to do is just make sure people know who you are and but I agree with you you
[53:56.880 --> 54:00.560]  also have to be alert you have to be willing to defend I think it actually
[54:00.560 --> 54:04.280]  happened they didn't threaten but they insinuated that they might have to
[54:04.280 --> 54:08.920]  consider legal action I think that's finally when there was a slight backing
[54:08.920 --> 54:12.600]  down on that one that then they finally got the information from the girl and
[54:12.600 --> 54:17.560]  said oh no I really didn't say that so so I think well my point is Congressman it
[54:17.560 --> 54:21.520]  shows how desperate they are I mean this is some of the dirtiest tricks I've
[54:21.520 --> 54:26.320]  ever seen because they know you know he's a real bonafide true constitutionalist
[54:26.320 --> 54:31.200]  and if he becomes the leader of the Tea Party that is gonna supercharge you
[54:31.200 --> 54:36.480]  perhaps even winning the presidency we have to think big and realize that this
[54:36.480 --> 54:40.720]  is possible and we have to realize that they're gonna run other dirty tricks
[54:40.720 --> 54:45.640]  against you and we've got to understand that that that that's why it's so
[54:45.640 --> 54:49.960]  important to get behind campaigns for liberty and donate to get behind Rand
[54:49.960 --> 54:55.040]  right now letters to the editor everything we've got to get him in the
[54:55.040 --> 55:00.000]  US Senate and so far things are looking pretty good you know I I think he's
[55:00.000 --> 55:05.080]  holding his lead and that's good there's still a few months but I think your word
[55:05.080 --> 55:08.400]  of caution is legitimate because there's still a couple months to go and if
[55:08.400 --> 55:11.920]  they've done that much already you know at the end when they think you don't have
[55:11.920 --> 55:16.080]  enough time to answer or clarify they may throw a lot more mud around they may
[55:16.080 --> 55:20.320]  claim he's really a vampire I mean I mean there's they may say he's the
[55:20.320 --> 55:24.600]  Loch Ness monster well if they get over the top I think they are over the top
[55:24.600 --> 55:29.280]  but I think they've lost their credibility so people are people are a
[55:29.280 --> 55:33.120]  little more sophisticated than I think a lot of people you've credit for I bought
[55:33.120 --> 55:37.880]  I was I assumed for many years well if they ever know what I really believe in
[55:37.880 --> 55:42.080]  how little government I believe in I couldn't possibly get elected so I
[55:42.080 --> 55:47.080]  sometimes I even surprised myself when people wow people really don't like big
[55:47.080 --> 55:50.480]  government they want to be left alone well you know what Victor Hugo said
[55:50.480 --> 55:56.080]  Congressman no army can stop an idea whose time has come and do you agree that
[55:56.080 --> 56:00.080]  we've seen a massive realignment and the pendulum is now swinging back but
[56:00.080 --> 56:04.160]  we're in the maximum phase of danger because the ruling class is going to
[56:04.160 --> 56:09.200]  try to keep this this this crony socialist system in place yeah they'll
[56:09.200 --> 56:12.800]  be desperate and they have a lot of power they have a lot of guns and they
[56:12.800 --> 56:18.080]  they have the political power but the ideas like you say are more powerful
[56:18.080 --> 56:23.240]  than the army so I want to always work real hard at remaining optimistic that
[56:23.240 --> 56:27.640]  present our views and we can overcome the all the bad ideas that we're
[56:27.640 --> 56:31.680]  suffering from today congressman in closing I hate to bring up what I see is
[56:31.680 --> 56:35.760]  distractions but the ground zero mosque is now the biggest story in the
[56:35.760 --> 56:39.800]  country and and is a diversion this is kind of a liberal sect of muslims but
[56:39.800 --> 56:44.360]  regardless I don't like ever agreeing with Obama and I do think they should
[56:44.360 --> 56:48.600]  look for another place just because the community's gotten so outraged but I am
[56:48.600 --> 56:52.880]  against government coming in and saying what people can do religiously and
[56:52.880 --> 56:57.120]  violating the First Amendment what's your view on that a and b Pelosi though
[56:57.120 --> 57:02.480]  saying she wants to investigate anybody who's upset about it implying that
[57:02.480 --> 57:05.680]  people don't have a right to be upset so we're seeing tyranny from both sides
[57:05.680 --> 57:11.400]  yeah you know and I think it's a big distraction this is a grand distraction
[57:11.400 --> 57:16.400]  from the real issue you know the country's in in golf in this war as well
[57:16.400 --> 57:21.080]  as a financial crisis and they're spending all the time on on on this but
[57:21.080 --> 57:24.520]  to me it should have been a grand opportunity and you really touched on
[57:24.520 --> 57:28.520]  the opportunity because this is a property rights issue of the property
[57:28.520 --> 57:34.160]  and it's also a civil liberties issue it's a freedom of speech issue and this
[57:34.160 --> 57:38.560]  to me is so different than what the liberals say the liberals say well
[57:38.560 --> 57:42.280]  we'll we'll allow you to speak but not to protect your private property
[57:42.280 --> 57:46.120]  conservatives say well we don't worry too much about your speech but we want to
[57:46.120 --> 57:49.320]  protect your private about your your property rights you know they want to
[57:49.320 --> 57:55.280]  regulate all the things that we do in stores and how much salt you can use
[57:55.280 --> 57:59.440]  in restaurants and all that so then when you get a guy like Bloomberg he's up
[57:59.440 --> 58:03.240]  there saying oh yeah this is a property rights issue but think of what Bloomberg
[58:03.240 --> 58:07.440]  does to property rights issue I think this is a tremendously opportune time
[58:07.440 --> 58:11.840]  for us to point out that property rights and civil rights are are one of the
[58:11.840 --> 58:17.320]  same but I think what's behind this it drives the neocons nuts because they
[58:17.320 --> 58:23.000]  can't pursue this international war on terrorism without having a hated enemy
[58:23.000 --> 58:28.400]  and the hated enemy is Islam and I don't believe for a minute that the quote
[58:28.400 --> 58:33.280]  religion of Islam is our enemy congressman where congressman we're out
[58:33.280 --> 58:36.880]  of time look forward to speaking to you again God bless you thank you good to be

[1:00:00.280 --> 1:00:12.160]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[1:00:12.160 --> 1:00:19.720]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[1:00:19.720 --> 1:00:25.120]  Alex Jones okay it's hour number two we just had congressman Ron Paul on with
[1:00:25.120 --> 1:00:31.120]  us live for 30 minutes I want to open the phones up in the next segment ahead
[1:00:31.120 --> 1:00:38.160]  of pastor Anderson who has now defeated the feds in court they're trying to
[1:00:38.160 --> 1:00:43.320]  prosecute him for demanding his constitutional rights at a illegal
[1:00:43.320 --> 1:00:47.380]  checkpoint so we're going to be talking to him briefly coming up in about 30
[1:00:47.380 --> 1:00:51.680]  minutes and I'll continue with calls into the third hour I've got a bunch of
[1:00:51.680 --> 1:00:56.120]  health news I want to get into the government lies the American people
[1:00:56.120 --> 1:01:00.160]  about the safety of Gulf seafood more and more scientists are coming out who
[1:01:00.160 --> 1:01:04.440]  been out in the Gulf they say there are fishers more than 25 miles away they've
[1:01:04.440 --> 1:01:08.420]  capped the oil well but it's already blown out deep underground in those
[1:01:08.420 --> 1:01:11.920]  fishers there's a big cover up there I know you already know about that but
[1:01:11.920 --> 1:01:17.840]  there's been new chapters in that we'll also get into some other key reports
[1:01:17.840 --> 1:01:24.200]  dealing with new study 85% of big farmers new drugs or lemons and pose
[1:01:24.200 --> 1:01:29.800]  health risk to users so the corruption is just intensifying where the system
[1:01:29.800 --> 1:01:32.720]  doesn't care how corrupt they are they're already out in the open as
[1:01:32.720 --> 1:01:36.720]  tyrants they think their police state and their control of the courts to a
[1:01:36.720 --> 1:01:42.120]  certain extent is going to protect them we'll be discussing that also you're
[1:01:42.120 --> 1:01:48.120]  welcome to call in with your views on the ground zero mosque I think that once
[1:01:48.120 --> 1:01:54.360]  New Yorkers got really upset about it and said we don't want it there that if
[1:01:54.360 --> 1:01:59.440]  I was a Muslim and if I was planning to build it there I might move it but it
[1:01:59.440 --> 1:02:03.760]  is two blocks big New York blocks away so I see both sides but I'm a property
[1:02:03.760 --> 1:02:11.120]  rights guy and a First Amendment guy a hundred and ten percent and so if we take
[1:02:11.120 --> 1:02:17.600]  their right to have that mosque there I will lose my right and this is gonna set
[1:02:17.600 --> 1:02:21.080]  a very bad precedent it looks like they're gonna end up somehow defeating
[1:02:21.080 --> 1:02:27.040]  this mosque and it's just a giant political diversion to re-envoke the
[1:02:27.040 --> 1:02:32.920]  clash of civilizations look I love my Western culture I'm a Christian and I
[1:02:32.920 --> 1:02:36.520]  believe people should be Christians but I'm not gonna make them but I know that
[1:02:36.520 --> 1:02:39.520]  we don't need to have wars with the Muslims and that it's a very diverse
[1:02:39.520 --> 1:02:44.000]  group of people and this whole thing is being used and so you've got Republicans
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:49.160]  many of them wanting to censor and control people's First Amendment with
[1:02:49.160 --> 1:02:52.080]  this mosque and violate the property rights and the Democrats some of them
[1:02:52.080 --> 1:02:56.200]  are saying they're for it but then on the other hand you've got Nancy Pelosi
[1:02:56.200 --> 1:03:04.280]  and we've got this clip coming up saying we need to investigate we need to find
[1:03:04.280 --> 1:03:10.480]  out who's behind this mosque protest well it's the American people that's just
[1:03:10.480 --> 1:03:14.400]  like when they said people were protesting Democratic Congress people at
[1:03:14.400 --> 1:03:19.800]  town halls who were for government-run healthcare the polls show over 70% and
[1:03:19.800 --> 1:03:22.520]  it's growing as they learn more are against the government health care
[1:03:22.520 --> 1:03:26.720]  plan that's not run by some special interest are there special interests
[1:03:26.720 --> 1:03:31.040]  that were involved against it yes no we're allowed in this country to have
[1:03:31.040 --> 1:03:34.160]  our views people out there allowed to have their view against that mosque
[1:03:34.160 --> 1:03:39.200]  they're allowed to have a view for the mosque but it doesn't matter if 51% say
[1:03:39.200 --> 1:03:43.840]  no to the mosque we're a republic not a democracy and a democracy we could say
[1:03:43.840 --> 1:03:47.760]  51% say no Christian church is allowed there'd be no Christian church is
[1:03:47.760 --> 1:03:56.280]  allowed 51% you know say only mosque allowed only mosque allowed or vice versa
[1:03:56.280 --> 1:04:02.720]  or visa v any configuration you want in a democracy you can elect that off
[1:04:02.720 --> 1:04:06.240]  Hitler and he could say Jews are not allowed to live here they're going to
[1:04:06.240 --> 1:04:13.600]  camps in a republic the minority as well as the majority right is protected
[1:04:13.600 --> 1:04:18.000]  and Muslim cultures do not have a good track record of being Democratic or
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:22.120]  or constitutional they do have a good track record of being authoritarian I
[1:04:22.120 --> 1:04:26.400]  also don't like Muslim groups coming into the country and trying to tell
[1:04:26.400 --> 1:04:30.600]  people what we can do with our First Amendment I don't like stirring people
[1:04:30.600 --> 1:04:34.960]  up I wouldn't draw a picture of Muhammad is with his turban as a bomb but you
[1:04:34.960 --> 1:04:39.000]  know what Muslims don't need to come into this country and threaten people and
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:44.400]  threaten to kill them if they do that you understand so I don't like people

[1:08:23.760 --> 1:08:28.040]  your phone calls there's a lot of issues here but it mainly deals with the
[1:08:28.040 --> 1:08:33.360]  first amendment the right of religion the press the people speech expression
[1:08:33.360 --> 1:08:39.480]  and property rights also sacred in this country so if they're able to stop that
[1:08:39.480 --> 1:08:45.320]  mosque from being built two blocks away from ground zero all of us are going to
[1:08:45.320 --> 1:08:49.960]  suffer now I think when the public started getting angry about it you know
[1:08:49.960 --> 1:08:53.560]  that if I was a muslim and it was my mosque I would probably try to move it
[1:08:53.560 --> 1:08:57.920]  somewhere understanding what a propaganda coup this is going to be against
[1:08:57.920 --> 1:09:06.320]  muslims but they are pig headedly going ahead with it and I'm starting to think
[1:09:06.320 --> 1:09:11.120]  it's staged as a perfect propaganda coup at a subconscious level with
[1:09:11.120 --> 1:09:18.880]  territorialism to invoke 9 11 again and to basically hype this up as a pretext
[1:09:18.880 --> 1:09:24.880]  for a clash of civilizations with pakistan and iran and syria and this is now
[1:09:24.880 --> 1:09:27.480]  the biggest story in the country I haven't talked much about it the last
[1:09:27.480 --> 1:09:32.360]  month seeing it as a distraction I've given you my view on it I concur with
[1:09:32.360 --> 1:09:38.440]  ron paul's view on this I mean do we have property rights do we have
[1:09:38.440 --> 1:09:44.440]  religious rights in this country or don't we and I'm consistent on this I have
[1:09:44.440 --> 1:09:52.120]  come out and defended the Muhammad with a bomb on his head cartoons I think it's
[1:09:52.120 --> 1:09:57.080]  distasteful I think it stares people up it was designed to stir people up and
[1:09:57.080 --> 1:10:01.680]  we've since had threats in the US with other editorials making fun of Muhammad
[1:10:01.680 --> 1:10:07.560]  I wouldn't do that but you've got to support somebody's right to do it you've
[1:10:07.560 --> 1:10:10.920]  got to support their right to build that mosque you've got to support their
[1:10:10.920 --> 1:10:15.680]  right people that don't like Islam to make fun of it or we're not America
[1:10:15.680 --> 1:10:19.560]  anymore I was on man cow this morning and they had a supporter of the mosque on
[1:10:19.560 --> 1:10:23.760]  not a muslim some establishment so-called liberal far from a liberal
[1:10:23.760 --> 1:10:27.800]  thomas jefferson was a liberal this guy was no liberal and he was telling me well
[1:10:27.800 --> 1:10:32.920]  you ought to be arrested you and rush limbaugh and anybody else that that that
[1:10:32.920 --> 1:10:37.320]  thinks Obama was really an indonesian citizen his real name is Barry sitara
[1:10:37.320 --> 1:10:42.120]  and this is cast Sunstein at the White House's view you disagree with man may
[1:10:42.120 --> 1:10:46.440]  global warming he says they should look at finding you or even arresting you
[1:10:46.440 --> 1:10:52.000]  well whatever you believe about global warming isn't it your right to say what
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:58.200]  your view is I mean this is so fundamental this is so incredibly simple
[1:10:58.200 --> 1:11:02.600]  but now Nancy Pelosi who claims all the tea parties are fake the Republicans
[1:11:02.600 --> 1:11:05.840]  have tried to take it over but they've been unsuccessful to a certain extent
[1:11:05.840 --> 1:11:10.200]  she's now saying she wants to investigate I'm gonna play a clip of it from
[1:11:10.200 --> 1:11:15.560]  radio yesterday she wants to investigate who's behind this who's behind it well
[1:11:15.560 --> 1:11:21.880]  the media has hyped it and the citizenry is angry about it okay and and and the
[1:11:21.880 --> 1:11:27.080]  fact that Obama has come out in support of this and it's now hitting him even
[1:11:27.080 --> 1:11:31.520]  worse than the poll numbers you know it's very painful for me because I don't
[1:11:31.520 --> 1:11:35.720]  like to agree with Obama on anything but quite frankly this is a guy who's
[1:11:35.720 --> 1:11:39.080]  trampled on property rights and trampled on freedom with government-run
[1:11:39.080 --> 1:11:43.600]  health care and trampled on it with his carbon taxes and he quite frankly to a
[1:11:43.600 --> 1:11:48.760]  certain extent is right about this mosque situation but Pelosi is wrong
[1:11:48.760 --> 1:11:53.960]  saying investigate anybody who is against this it's their first amendment
[1:11:53.960 --> 1:11:58.360]  right these people are a bunch of thugs let's play that clip and I join of the
[1:11:58.360 --> 1:12:03.800]  those who have called for looking into how is this opposition to the mosque
[1:12:03.800 --> 1:12:08.080]  being funded how is this being ginned up that here we are talking about
[1:12:08.080 --> 1:12:12.360]  Treasure Island something we've been working on for decades something of
[1:12:12.360 --> 1:12:16.920]  great interest to our community as we go forward to an election about the
[1:12:16.920 --> 1:12:21.080]  future of our country and two of the first three questions are about a zoning
[1:12:21.080 --> 1:12:27.360]  issue in New York City that was KCBS 740 a.m. so you know we need to
[1:12:27.360 --> 1:12:32.760]  investigate we need to look at people that are ginning this up and that's what
[1:12:32.760 --> 1:12:38.000]  the diversities are at the FCC's called for that's what more than what is it
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:44.640]  eight plus of the czars are talking about government-appointed committees that
[1:12:44.640 --> 1:12:48.520]  decide in your city what can be on the air and then they file complaints and
[1:12:48.520 --> 1:12:54.640]  then you can't criticize things because it might stir people up the whole system
[1:12:54.640 --> 1:12:59.880]  wants to censor because once they're able to censor one group they can
[1:12:59.880 --> 1:13:05.080]  censor everybody it's so simple let's go to Daniel Daniel were you calling us
[1:13:05.080 --> 1:13:10.440]  from hi Alex this is Daniel from St. Paul Minnesota welcome thank you very
[1:13:10.440 --> 1:13:16.200]  much sir I'm very nervous here I'm calling about the amount of oil flowing
[1:13:16.200 --> 1:13:20.920]  into the Gulf from the oil spill I've been a plumbing designer for almost 40
[1:13:20.920 --> 1:13:27.440]  years and there's formulas used for plumbing design that are based on the
[1:13:27.440 --> 1:13:31.320]  American Society of Plumbing Engineer data books there's four books that come
[1:13:31.320 --> 1:13:40.760]  out and the first book has an equation 1-8 it's for flow at outlet the flow at
[1:13:40.760 --> 1:13:46.000]  the outlet in GPM equals 20 times the inside diameter of the outlet squared in
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:50.840]  inches times the square root of the no I understand so you know the math I mean
[1:13:50.840 --> 1:13:55.720]  what's your point yes sir I'm the what that works it out to is that very
[1:13:55.720 --> 1:14:01.040]  conservative like 5,000 psi and a five inch wellhead outlet that well was
[1:14:01.040 --> 1:14:06.720]  flowing two million gallons per hour no that could have been abiotic oil and it
[1:14:06.720 --> 1:14:10.880]  could have been 20,000 to 70,000 psi they could have a seven inch wellhead on
[1:14:10.880 --> 1:14:14.520]  that the reports I've heard of you know I don't know for sure I just took
[1:14:14.520 --> 1:14:19.200]  conservative figures for it figured it out and yeah the bottom line is they've
[1:14:19.200 --> 1:14:24.160]  been lying to us from the beginning and now Obama says core exit is good for you
[1:14:24.160 --> 1:14:29.200]  and there's no health problems and they say the oil flow has stopped and 70% of
[1:14:29.200 --> 1:14:33.120]  the oils cleaned up and that's a complete lie they sprayed 40 plus million
[1:14:33.120 --> 1:14:38.400]  gallons conservatively of dispersant on it that sent it underwater so it wouldn't
[1:14:38.400 --> 1:14:43.040]  float and they are involved in a huge cover-up of what's really happening and
[1:14:43.040 --> 1:14:46.160]  there's fishers all over the gulf that's been confirmed by every major
[1:14:46.160 --> 1:14:49.560]  university down there that's gone out there and researched it it is still
[1:14:49.560 --> 1:14:54.760]  ongoing and they're just telling the public that the problem is solved that's
[1:14:54.760 --> 1:14:59.040]  correct in 40 days that would have flowed 2 billion gallons at 2 million
[1:14:59.040 --> 1:15:03.680]  gallons per hour and 2 billion gallons is what the reserve of that should have
[1:15:03.680 --> 1:15:08.760]  been well they actually be estimates that the well is still 98% full and
[1:15:08.760 --> 1:15:12.760]  that there's 2 billion in it but but nobody really knows and I appreciate
[1:15:12.760 --> 1:15:16.680]  your call very interesting points Daniel Zach in Toronto Canada you're on the
[1:15:16.680 --> 1:15:21.880]  air Zach I'll tell you today cancer I just wanted to give you my two cents
[1:15:21.880 --> 1:15:25.040]  from up in Toronto anyway on what I thought of the mosque and your ground
[1:15:25.040 --> 1:15:29.880]  zero and that is basically we're we're not even sure if it was a Muslim that
[1:15:29.880 --> 1:15:34.080]  that did this crime so I don't understand it seems like you said to a set up to
[1:15:34.080 --> 1:15:38.440]  me where they just started trying to bait and issue whereas if it was you know
[1:15:38.440 --> 1:15:42.680]  a synagogue or a church there'd be no problem whatsoever and we're still not
[1:15:42.680 --> 1:15:46.040]  even sure if the people who perpetrated these crimes we don't know what
[1:15:46.040 --> 1:15:50.760]  religion they're from well this particular group is the smallest sect of
[1:15:50.760 --> 1:15:57.800]  Islam 80% roughly are of course the original Saudi Arabian based and then
[1:15:57.800 --> 1:16:05.040]  about 19% are Shiite that's based in around Iran but it's global 1% is made
[1:16:05.040 --> 1:16:10.960]  up of several other groups and this group is the smallest subsect I mean the
[1:16:10.960 --> 1:16:15.680]  best way to describe it's kind of new agey but it's very old but it's more
[1:16:15.680 --> 1:16:20.240]  mystic and so that's the point that's been made is this is like an offshoot
[1:16:20.240 --> 1:16:27.440]  really kind of liberal Islam and you know this is cheap property it is pretty
[1:16:27.440 --> 1:16:30.760]  far away and that's what they keep pointing out hey this thing is two city
[1:16:30.760 --> 1:16:35.080]  blocks away I mean that's far away and and why are we worried about this when
[1:16:35.080 --> 1:16:39.720]  Elena Kagan is an anti-American globalist who's openly anti-free speech
[1:16:39.720 --> 1:16:43.440]  anti-second amendment and they're about to start World War three with Iran I
[1:16:43.440 --> 1:16:50.000]  mean we've got bigger fish to fry than obsessing over this so so it is much to
[1:16:50.000 --> 1:16:55.120]  do about nothing and it's gonna be if they're successful hurt property rights
[1:16:55.120 --> 1:17:01.800]  and the First Amendment but again a lot of people think that Muslims did carry
[1:17:01.800 --> 1:17:05.480]  out 9-11 even though the official story is clearly a fable which uses a pretext
[1:17:05.480 --> 1:17:10.320]  to invade those countries and so they're taking it as a big slap in the face so
[1:17:10.320 --> 1:17:14.400]  if Nancy Pelosi wants to ask who's hyping this the mainstream media that
[1:17:14.400 --> 1:17:19.040]  loves to divide and conquer I mean Nancy Pelosi when she issues race baiting or
[1:17:19.040 --> 1:17:22.560]  says if you don't like government-run health care you're a racist you know
[1:17:22.560 --> 1:17:27.120]  she's invoking divide and conquer for political power so she knows full well
[1:17:27.120 --> 1:17:31.520]  what some of the Republicans are doing but you heard Ron Paul last hour I mean
[1:17:31.520 --> 1:17:36.200]  you know he basically agrees with me about what's happening here well exactly
[1:17:36.200 --> 1:17:40.760]  that's just sort of I mean all I had to say on that issue but just wanted to
[1:17:40.760 --> 1:17:44.120]  throw that out there that you know it it's definitely something staged because
[1:17:44.120 --> 1:17:49.640]  they're not really um it's a tar baby it's a total distraction yes it's a
[1:17:49.640 --> 1:17:54.760]  tar baby from the depression exactly from the wars they're getting ready for
[1:17:54.760 --> 1:17:58.400]  for everything that's happening I appreciate your call I mean really did
[1:17:58.400 --> 1:18:03.280]  does this mosque matter I mean why are the Republicans if they're so scared of
[1:18:03.280 --> 1:18:12.520]  Muslims talking about reducing illegal and legal immigration I mean they I mean
[1:18:12.520 --> 1:18:16.840]  if that's supposedly the issue that Muslims are so horrible why not limit
[1:18:16.840 --> 1:18:21.640]  their numbers see no no they want more so they can then have a bigger fight in
[1:18:21.640 --> 1:18:26.120]  this country let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Wisconsin Chris you're on the
[1:18:26.120 --> 1:18:33.360]  air hey Alex first time I'm calling welcome and hey I tend to agree with you pretty much on
[1:18:33.360 --> 1:18:40.760]  this issue I think given that we need a foothold or something to give us entry
[1:18:40.760 --> 1:18:45.000]  into wars in the Middle East that's a way to re-invoke 9-11 and look the
[1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:50.320]  Muslims are in our territory look they're dissing us right it's that I
[1:18:50.320 --> 1:18:53.880]  get again what you said it's a divide and conquer gives us a reason to be over
[1:18:53.880 --> 1:18:59.040]  there and I think it's contrived to begin with and then I guess my second
[1:18:59.040 --> 1:19:02.600]  point would be yeah I do believe that this is just a distraction issue it's a
[1:19:02.600 --> 1:19:08.880]  non-issue it's just a way to get people to choose a side and you know divide the

[1:24:23.760 --> 1:24:27.760]  and I was just a little bit late getting back as I was looking at the
[1:24:27.760 --> 1:24:31.760]  gold numbers gold is up $5.70
[1:24:31.760 --> 1:24:35.760]  from yesterday it's up almost $50 in the last
[1:24:35.760 --> 1:24:39.760]  week it's at $1,230.40
[1:24:39.760 --> 1:24:43.760]  back up to the levels it was a few months ago
[1:24:43.760 --> 1:24:47.760]  we've got a guest coming up to deal with the border situation
[1:24:47.760 --> 1:24:51.760]  and the police state with some key intel and
[1:24:51.760 --> 1:24:55.760]  some successes had in the next segment and we'll continue with your calls
[1:24:55.760 --> 1:24:59.760]  but I wanted to briefly bring Ted Anderson the owner of the Genesis
[1:24:59.760 --> 1:25:03.760]  Communications Radio Network on he's also the owner of Midas
[1:25:03.760 --> 1:25:07.760]  Resources and he's got the best deals in gold and silver out there
[1:25:07.760 --> 1:25:11.760]  I challenge you with these radio specials we're about to offer to go try to find
[1:25:11.760 --> 1:25:15.760]  a lower price on sovereigns on Frank's and some of the other coins
[1:25:15.760 --> 1:25:19.760]  of the silver the junk silver Ted bought this
[1:25:19.760 --> 1:25:23.760]  when gold went down by $50 and he's not raising his price like everybody
[1:25:23.760 --> 1:25:27.760]  else does he's selling it to you at the old price so you cannot
[1:25:27.760 --> 1:25:31.760]  beat these deals these only come up sometimes a few times a year
[1:25:31.760 --> 1:25:35.760]  sometimes once a month but we're going into the fall and historically it's only going to
[1:25:35.760 --> 1:25:39.760]  go up especially with all the dollar devaluation going on
[1:25:39.760 --> 1:25:43.760]  all the monetization of debt it's time to move out of paper and this radio
[1:25:43.760 --> 1:25:47.760]  special you can call tell the brokers it's a radio special and take advantage of it
[1:25:47.760 --> 1:25:51.760]  Ted give folks today's offer and tell us how long you can offer
[1:25:51.760 --> 1:25:55.760]  this because I know you're getting a lot of calls and a lot of orders when are you going to run out of the
[1:25:55.760 --> 1:25:59.760]  gold and silver you bought at the lower price well I mean for starters the market
[1:25:59.760 --> 1:26:03.760]  is turning back into a flash again where people are starting to buy like crazy
[1:26:03.760 --> 1:26:07.760]  I mean June and July things were deader than Adorno you could hear a pin drop around here
[1:26:07.760 --> 1:26:11.760]  but now all of a sudden it's just like somebody threw a spark back on the
[1:26:11.760 --> 1:26:15.760]  fire right now that Frank is at 265 that is
[1:26:15.760 --> 1:26:19.760]  the same price I offered it yesterday and also back when gold was at 1180
[1:26:19.760 --> 1:26:23.760]  here just last week and then the British sovereign was at
[1:26:23.760 --> 1:26:27.760]  333.86 and like you say Alex I mean I don't come up very often
[1:26:27.760 --> 1:26:31.760]  but when the market is starting to heat up like this we do need to talk about
[1:26:31.760 --> 1:26:35.760]  gold debt to GDP right now is going to exceed
[1:26:35.760 --> 1:26:39.760]  93% this year that means 93% of what we produce is going to be
[1:26:39.760 --> 1:26:43.760]  consumed by our debt and that's just a number you can't keep on working
[1:26:43.760 --> 1:26:47.760]  with and so we're going to see a devaluation of the currency due to the fact
[1:26:47.760 --> 1:26:51.760]  that the government's going to have to print money in order to cover obligations
[1:26:51.760 --> 1:26:55.760]  because we're not producing enough to pay taxes to cover those obligations
[1:26:55.760 --> 1:26:59.760]  so that's what's going to happen that's what I predict for the future and I don't know just about everybody else
[1:26:59.760 --> 1:27:03.760]  is too but the Franks right now at 265
[1:27:03.760 --> 1:27:07.760]  the British sovereign is right now at 333.86
[1:27:07.760 --> 1:27:11.760]  the walking liberty has at 975 all that stuff looks
[1:27:11.760 --> 1:27:15.760]  really good right now and like you said we're sitting here in August
[1:27:15.760 --> 1:27:19.760]  September October November are always better months for gold and silver
[1:27:19.760 --> 1:27:23.760]  it just happens to work out that way June and July are always the soft
[1:27:23.760 --> 1:27:27.760]  time and we're just coming out of that time where everything is softened up
[1:27:27.760 --> 1:27:31.760]  now we've seen $1233 an ounce already as a high today
[1:27:31.760 --> 1:27:35.760]  and it's not surprising to me that it's happening it's happening like if you know
[1:27:35.760 --> 1:27:39.760]  you have a good solid Swiss watch that never loses time that's what
[1:27:39.760 --> 1:27:43.760]  the gold and silver market is doing right now it's acting just like it normally does
[1:27:43.760 --> 1:27:47.760]  it's about ready to head into the fall and that's when the market does its best
[1:27:47.760 --> 1:27:51.760]  and I expect it to be the same this year with the Hindenburg thing that they're
[1:27:51.760 --> 1:27:55.760]  talking about last week and you know the stock market
[1:27:55.760 --> 1:27:59.760]  Hindenburg Omen in almost every case you have a massive stock
[1:27:59.760 --> 1:28:03.760]  market plunge within 45 days of the Hindenburg Omen
[1:28:03.760 --> 1:28:07.760]  that's just one of those indicators that are out there
[1:28:07.760 --> 1:28:11.760]  I was reading the Aids and Sisters this morning another newsletter
[1:28:11.760 --> 1:28:15.760]  I really like Bob Chapman's newsletter too I read that just earlier as well
[1:28:15.760 --> 1:28:19.760]  that you get that free with that frank at $265 that's $159 subscription
[1:28:19.760 --> 1:28:23.760]  you can hardly beat that but I just need to tell people
[1:28:23.760 --> 1:28:27.760]  if you've been thinking about gold if you're invested in the stock market have money in the bank
[1:28:27.760 --> 1:28:31.760]  you know annuities I mean you name it there's just a long list of
[1:28:31.760 --> 1:28:35.760]  investments that are going to get hurt when we have inflation here in the United States
[1:28:35.760 --> 1:28:39.760]  Ted I give people advice that I follow be self sufficient
[1:28:39.760 --> 1:28:43.760]  second amendment storeable foods gold silver
[1:28:43.760 --> 1:28:47.760]  I've been buying gold since it was $260 an ounce eight years ago
[1:28:47.760 --> 1:28:51.760]  and I never sold you know even when it hit its high and it's testing that high again
[1:28:51.760 --> 1:28:55.760]  because it's an emergency backup for my family and my
[1:28:55.760 --> 1:28:59.760]  operation and whether it's one coin or ten coins
[1:28:59.760 --> 1:29:03.760]  or a hundred silver coins or one silver coin no order is too
[1:29:03.760 --> 1:29:07.760]  small no order is too big except I know time and time again
[1:29:07.760 --> 1:29:11.760]  you buy when it's low and sell it when it's high at the low price you run out
[1:29:11.760 --> 1:29:15.760]  and you're saying your supplies won't last long so people need to give

[1:33:17.760 --> 1:33:21.760]  we're going to be talking to Pastor Steven Anderson
[1:33:21.760 --> 1:33:25.760]  here in just a moment here are the headlines Tempe Pastor
[1:33:25.760 --> 1:33:29.760]  cleared in checkpoint confrontation news 5
[1:33:29.760 --> 1:33:33.760]  Pastor filed civil suit against border patrol
[1:33:33.760 --> 1:33:37.760]  that's out of my Fox Phoenix here's another one Pastor acquitted interstate 8
[1:33:37.760 --> 1:33:41.760]  checkpoint incident so we'll be discussing all of that
[1:33:41.760 --> 1:33:45.760]  with him in a moment from Arizona
[1:33:45.760 --> 1:33:49.760]  but first dealing with high treason by the federal government
[1:33:49.760 --> 1:33:53.760]  I've had members of Congress on I've had Sheriff's on who agree this is treason
[1:33:53.760 --> 1:33:57.760]  or borders on treason it also violates the ninth amendment
[1:33:57.760 --> 1:34:01.760]  as well as the 11th the first amendment they passed after the first tens
[1:34:01.760 --> 1:34:05.760]  said foreign powers or corporations
[1:34:05.760 --> 1:34:09.760]  cannot induce the federal government to sue
[1:34:09.760 --> 1:34:13.760]  a state or individual on behalf of a foreign power
[1:34:13.760 --> 1:34:17.760]  or individual and who does the federal government say
[1:34:17.760 --> 1:34:21.760]  they're suing on behalf of the illegal aliens
[1:34:21.760 --> 1:34:25.760]  the illegal aliens ladies and gentlemen that are turning Arizona into a police state
[1:34:25.760 --> 1:34:29.760]  the crime is the highest in the country for kidnapping
[1:34:29.760 --> 1:34:33.760]  and carjacking now even going past Los Angeles
[1:34:33.760 --> 1:34:37.760]  the majority of people in the county jails in that area are illegal aliens
[1:34:37.760 --> 1:34:41.760]  they can use any alias they want operate however they want and then meanwhile
[1:34:41.760 --> 1:34:45.760]  we've caught the border patrol under federal orders harassing Hispanic
[1:34:45.760 --> 1:34:49.760]  and Asian citizens who are clearly citizens and they put these checkpoints
[1:34:49.760 --> 1:34:53.760]  10 miles, 50 miles, 80 miles under federal regulations
[1:34:53.760 --> 1:34:57.760]  in some cases 100 miles like in Vermont and other areas
[1:34:57.760 --> 1:35:01.760]  where they search citizens and waive the illegals through
[1:35:01.760 --> 1:35:05.760]  pastor Anderson is driving through they walk over and say the dog alerted on drugs
[1:35:05.760 --> 1:35:09.760]  he said there was no dog bring it out they said no
[1:35:09.760 --> 1:35:13.760]  drug him out of his car beat him up really bad on video and then charged him
[1:35:13.760 --> 1:35:17.760]  you gotta love how they charge you with resisting them when they're beating you
[1:35:17.760 --> 1:35:21.760]  and look I know the border patrol got some of the toughest jobs
[1:35:21.760 --> 1:35:25.760]  I actually know some of the border patrol agents and I mean to tell you it's tough
[1:35:25.760 --> 1:35:29.760]  they're outnumbered outgunned
[1:35:29.760 --> 1:35:33.760]  they're not allowed to have high powered weapons to defend themselves they're being killed
[1:35:33.760 --> 1:35:37.760]  and I have some reports here dealing
[1:35:37.760 --> 1:35:41.760]  with this where it's saying record
[1:35:41.760 --> 1:35:45.760]  states by border patrol agents border patrol sees rise in
[1:35:45.760 --> 1:35:49.760]  suicides Texas U.S. Border Patrol agents are killing themselves same thing in Arizona
[1:35:49.760 --> 1:35:53.760]  in greater numbers after nearly four years without one
[1:35:53.760 --> 1:35:57.760]  suicide records obtained by the Associated Press show that at least 15 agents have taken
[1:35:57.760 --> 1:36:01.760]  their own lives since February 2008 the largest spike in suicides
[1:36:01.760 --> 1:36:05.760]  the agency has seen in the last 20 years it's unclear exactly why the men
[1:36:05.760 --> 1:36:09.760]  into their lives few left notes and the federal
[1:36:09.760 --> 1:36:13.760]  agencies insist the deaths have nothing to do with the agency or its increased
[1:36:13.760 --> 1:36:17.760]  volatility on the U.S. Mexican border yeah has nothing to do with that
[1:36:17.760 --> 1:36:21.760]  continuing here and this is what's really serious this is cyber news
[1:36:21.760 --> 1:36:25.760]  service Arizona Sheriff Border Patrol has retreated from parts of
[1:36:25.760 --> 1:36:29.760]  border because it's quote too dangerous Sheriff Larry Denver of Cochise County
[1:36:29.760 --> 1:36:33.760]  Arizona one of the four Arizona counties contiguous with the U.S.
[1:36:33.760 --> 1:36:37.760]  Mexican border said Friday that the U.S. Border Patrol
[1:36:37.760 --> 1:36:41.760]  attacked from parts of the border and has neighboring counties because
[1:36:41.760 --> 1:36:45.760]  manning those areas become too dangerous and the feds of course a month ago
[1:36:45.760 --> 1:36:49.760]  put up signs saying don't go into these areas for citizens
[1:36:49.760 --> 1:36:53.760]  national parks state parks major highways it's too dangerous so
[1:36:53.760 --> 1:36:57.760]  this country is being conquered by the drug cartels in the Mexican troops
[1:36:57.760 --> 1:37:01.760]  he says and you frankly have Border Patrol men and I know this from talking to
[1:37:01.760 --> 1:37:05.760]  Border Patrol agents who will not allow their agents to work on the border because it's too dangerous
[1:37:05.760 --> 1:37:09.760]  Denver told CNS news in a videotaped interview
[1:37:09.760 --> 1:37:13.760]  now what kind of message is that for crying out loud
[1:37:13.760 --> 1:37:17.760]  and if you dare pull over a drunk driving illegal
[1:37:17.760 --> 1:37:21.760]  and when they ask for the ID they're illegal you don't dare take him to jail
[1:37:21.760 --> 1:37:25.760]  but citizens you can beat the hell out of and nobody gets in trouble
[1:37:25.760 --> 1:37:29.760]  meanwhile U.S. may sue Arizona Sheriff Arpaio for not cooperating
[1:37:29.760 --> 1:37:33.760]  in investigation and they're also trying to sue them for
[1:37:33.760 --> 1:37:37.760]  committing immigration laws and you can say what you want about Arpaio but he isn't forcing the law
[1:37:37.760 --> 1:37:41.760]  the federal government is giving awards
[1:37:41.760 --> 1:37:45.760]  to 860 plus cities and that's all Vicente Fox
[1:37:45.760 --> 1:37:49.760]  do it five years ago in Austin it's in my many film it's an expanded extra of my film
[1:37:49.760 --> 1:37:53.760]  in game blueprint for global enslavement it's called battle for the republic
[1:37:53.760 --> 1:37:57.760]  18 minutes 17 minute film where we show Vicente Fox giving awards
[1:37:57.760 --> 1:38:01.760]  to Wells Fargo the city of Austin and the state
[1:38:01.760 --> 1:38:05.760]  for accepting consul matricula cards that are as fake as something
[1:38:05.760 --> 1:38:09.760]  to get in a crackerjack box and not enforcing against illegals
[1:38:09.760 --> 1:38:13.760]  when cops see a citizen they're told take the gloves off when they see an illegal
[1:38:13.760 --> 1:38:17.760]  get down your knees lick boots so federal investigation of
[1:38:17.760 --> 1:38:21.760]  controversial Arizona Sheriff known for tough immigration enforcement has intensified in recent days
[1:38:21.760 --> 1:38:25.760]  escalating the conflict between Obama administration officials in the border state
[1:38:25.760 --> 1:38:29.760]  just department officials in Washington have issued a rare threat to sue Maricopa County
[1:38:29.760 --> 1:38:33.760]  Sheriff Joe Arpaio if he's not cooperating with their investigation of whether he discriminates against Hispanics
[1:38:33.760 --> 1:38:37.760]  the civil rights inquiry is one of two
[1:38:37.760 --> 1:38:41.760]  that target the man who calls himself America's toughest sheriff
[1:38:41.760 --> 1:38:45.760]  a federal grand jury in Phoenix is examining whether Arpaio has used his power
[1:38:45.760 --> 1:38:49.760]  to investigate and intimidate political opponents
[1:38:49.760 --> 1:38:53.760]  whether his office misappropriated government money sources say
[1:38:53.760 --> 1:38:57.760]  so they're now persecuting local elected police
[1:38:57.760 --> 1:39:01.760]  local elective sheriff he's not the only one
[1:39:01.760 --> 1:39:05.760]  who are trying to defend this country from a lawless crime wave
[1:39:05.760 --> 1:39:09.760]  now I want to
[1:39:09.760 --> 1:39:13.760]  go to our guest pastor Stephen Anderson
[1:39:13.760 --> 1:39:17.760]  and again here's the headline Tempe pastor cleared in checkpoint
[1:39:17.760 --> 1:39:21.760]  confrontation AP a jury has acquitted Tempe pastor
[1:39:21.760 --> 1:39:25.760]  charged with failing to obey officers instructions as U.S. border checkpoint near
[1:39:25.760 --> 1:39:29.760]  Huma the jury also cleared Stephen Anderson of the faithful word Baptist church
[1:39:29.760 --> 1:39:33.760]  for obstructing a highway during the April 2009 incident
[1:39:33.760 --> 1:39:37.760]  at the interstate 8 checkpoint they had him pulled off both charges are misdemeanors
[1:39:37.760 --> 1:39:41.760]  a border patrol agent questioned Anderson about a citizenship but he refused to answer
[1:39:41.760 --> 1:39:45.760]  saying it was his constitutional right to remain silent yeah
[1:39:45.760 --> 1:39:49.760]  you have to pull someone over for speeding broken tail light
[1:39:49.760 --> 1:39:53.760]  weaving you have to have probable
[1:39:53.760 --> 1:39:57.760]  cause which the Arizona law said you have to have first contact for
[1:39:57.760 --> 1:40:01.760]  something else you don't just stop all the traffic and demand to search vehicles
[1:40:01.760 --> 1:40:05.760]  and they wanted to search his vehicle it's all on video we'll play some of that
[1:40:05.760 --> 1:40:09.760]  in the background for prison planet dot tv viewers while he's talking and watch the full audio
[1:40:09.760 --> 1:40:13.760]  info wars dot com and they drug him out and beat the living
[1:40:13.760 --> 1:40:17.760]  daylight sound of him so we now go to pastor Stephen Anderson pastor
[1:40:17.760 --> 1:40:21.760]  thanks for joining us thanks for having me you got a lot more courage in most people
[1:40:21.760 --> 1:40:25.760]  you stood up to him for your fourth and fifth amendment
[1:40:25.760 --> 1:40:29.760]  you wouldn't answer their questions after they try to do the fake alert with a dog
[1:40:29.760 --> 1:40:33.760]  then you stood up went to court faced the music one
[1:40:33.760 --> 1:40:37.760]  and you're suing him if more people did this the bill of rights will be alive
[1:40:37.760 --> 1:40:41.760]  and well pastor Anderson we appreciate you being a champion of liberty
[1:40:41.760 --> 1:40:45.760]  recap what happened in the whole saga and the latest developments
[1:40:45.760 --> 1:40:49.760]  sure I'll just quickly recap what happened basically I pulled up to the checkpoint
[1:40:49.760 --> 1:40:53.760]  and they're stopping every single person and they asked me if I was a US citizen
[1:40:53.760 --> 1:40:57.760]  I just asked them if I was free to leave they ended up coming up with
[1:40:57.760 --> 1:41:01.760]  about a minute later well this dog alerted your vehicle and so we have to
[1:41:01.760 --> 1:41:05.760]  search you therefore you can't leave and there was a standoff for about an hour
[1:41:05.760 --> 1:41:09.760]  and 15 minutes of me just standing my ground and you pointed out
[1:41:09.760 --> 1:41:13.760]  that the dog did not alert on you I told them that the dog that I did not
[1:41:13.760 --> 1:41:17.760]  believe that the dog alerted and I asked them to bring the dog back out and show me or provide
[1:41:17.760 --> 1:41:21.760]  some evidence which they refused to do after an hour or so
[1:41:21.760 --> 1:41:25.760]  the police the state police show up tell me I'm under arrest
[1:41:25.760 --> 1:41:29.760]  they asked for the dog to be brought out too because when I explained it to them
[1:41:29.760 --> 1:41:33.760]  they thought that was pretty reasonable the border patrol refused to bring the dog back out
[1:41:33.760 --> 1:41:37.760]  they broke out my windows tasered me maliciously shoved my face
[1:41:37.760 --> 1:41:41.760]  in broken glass and I had to go to the hospital get 11 stitches
[1:41:41.760 --> 1:41:45.760]  spend the night in jail for these two misdemeanor charges that they
[1:41:45.760 --> 1:41:49.760]  bumped up which the jury found me not guilty of both now an interesting
[1:41:49.760 --> 1:41:53.760]  thing that came out in the trial was that they brought in an expert witness
[1:41:53.760 --> 1:41:57.760]  that actually had taken part in the training of this particular
[1:41:57.760 --> 1:42:01.760]  dog and he was an expert on both DPS and Border Patrol canines
[1:42:01.760 --> 1:42:05.760]  and he stated that after watching the video that the dog
[1:42:05.760 --> 1:42:09.760]  did not alert but that it was just on the verge of alerting or
[1:42:09.760 --> 1:42:13.760]  on the fringe it was about to alert or thinking about alerting but that
[1:42:13.760 --> 1:42:17.760]  an alert would have consisted of the dog sitting down by the vehicle which it never
[1:42:17.760 --> 1:42:21.760]  sat down well the Border Patrol I want you to go over this some more it has more
[1:42:21.760 --> 1:42:25.760]  from what I've read more professional dogs they don't just give them biscuits
[1:42:25.760 --> 1:42:29.760]  every time they false alert as a pretext to search but a lot of state
[1:42:29.760 --> 1:42:33.760]  police a lot of local police are like Roscoe Pico
[1:42:33.760 --> 1:42:37.760]  train they get flash out of the car flash gets a biscuit
[1:42:37.760 --> 1:42:41.760]  every time he alerts and they just use it to search everybody's
[1:42:41.760 --> 1:42:45.760]  cars and get around the fourth amendment and probable cause
[1:42:45.760 --> 1:42:49.760]  but the expert in the trial said that the dog from the video
[1:42:49.760 --> 1:42:53.760]  appeared to begin to think about alerting but did an alert
[1:42:53.760 --> 1:42:57.760]  exactly right and that was the prosecutor's witness we did not call
[1:42:57.760 --> 1:43:01.760]  any witnesses all we did was cross examine the state's witnesses and their own
[1:43:01.760 --> 1:43:05.760]  witness explained that the dog was on the verge of alerting but that
[1:43:05.760 --> 1:43:09.760]  it did not fully alert it did not technically alert which of course
[1:43:09.760 --> 1:43:13.760]  they said over and over the dog alerted the dog alerted that was their pretext for searching me
[1:43:13.760 --> 1:43:17.760]  and it turned out that that's why they didn't want to bring the dog back out because
[1:43:17.760 --> 1:43:21.760]  you know they weren't they weren't confident that it was going to alert
[1:43:21.760 --> 1:43:25.760]  I mean you're like Paul from the Bible you don't just have a church
[1:43:25.760 --> 1:43:29.760]  you're a construction company guy you're a construction worker so
[1:43:29.760 --> 1:43:33.760]  you told me previously you're driving through these all the time they know you
[1:43:33.760 --> 1:43:37.760]  well I've driven through over 300 times I'm not sure if they knew me or not
[1:43:37.760 --> 1:43:41.760]  because I've never seen the same guy twice because they cycle them through these checkpoints
[1:43:41.760 --> 1:43:45.760]  and I've literally been through over 300 times I'm not exaggerating and yet
[1:43:45.760 --> 1:43:49.760]  I've never seen the same agent twice so I don't really know whether
[1:43:49.760 --> 1:43:53.760]  they'd heard my reputation from YouTube or whatever but
[1:43:53.760 --> 1:43:57.760]  you know I'm not I'm not really sure I think this was retribution
[1:43:57.760 --> 1:44:01.760]  that they were persecuting you because you'd posted a whole bunch of YouTube videos
[1:44:01.760 --> 1:44:05.760]  of you arguing and saying no successfully previously correct
[1:44:05.760 --> 1:44:09.760]  and they did say to me while I was there in the Border Patrol trailer after they'd beaten me
[1:44:09.760 --> 1:44:13.760]  and my face was bloodied up they said well you didn't win this time
[1:44:13.760 --> 1:44:17.760]  you're not going to put this on YouTube because we won this time and they were kind of rubbing
[1:44:17.760 --> 1:44:21.760]  my nose in it as it were so well let's talk about that
[1:44:21.760 --> 1:44:25.760]  because I mean watching the video from their own surveillance
[1:44:25.760 --> 1:44:29.760]  camera I see them swinging a baton jumping on you
[1:44:29.760 --> 1:44:33.760]  some of it then happens behind the car but I mean how long did they beat you
[1:44:33.760 --> 1:44:37.760]  how specifically did they assault you with deadly weapons
[1:44:37.760 --> 1:44:41.760]  the main assault that did the most damage to me
[1:44:41.760 --> 1:44:45.760]  was that while I was being tasered for over 18 seconds
[1:44:45.760 --> 1:44:49.760]  while that taser was paralyzing me and putting me in
[1:44:49.760 --> 1:44:53.760]  hellish pain one of the Border Patrol agents I believe it was
[1:44:53.760 --> 1:44:57.760]  Agent Spoonamore according to the reports grabbed my head and just shoved it into
[1:44:57.760 --> 1:45:01.760]  the broken glass shards that were still on the door frame and I have some pictures
[1:45:01.760 --> 1:45:05.760]  to prove that where you just see my door frame and there's just a ton of blood
[1:45:05.760 --> 1:45:09.760]  in the shape of my head in one spot well we've got the videos
[1:45:09.760 --> 1:45:13.760]  of you after it cuts all over blood all over your clothes
[1:45:13.760 --> 1:45:17.760]  but watching the video after it cuts from your camera when they
[1:45:17.760 --> 1:45:21.760]  taser you it cuts out it appears one of them standing over you
[1:45:21.760 --> 1:45:25.760]  swinging some type of a baton
[1:45:25.760 --> 1:45:29.760]  I don't know if they swung anything at me but I know that after they put me on the ground
[1:45:29.760 --> 1:45:33.760]  one of them was stepping on my head with his boot
[1:45:33.760 --> 1:45:37.760]  and he called that quote controlling my head
[1:45:37.760 --> 1:45:41.760]  so he had his foot on my head with what felt like
[1:45:41.760 --> 1:45:45.760]  all of his weight while I was being tasered
[1:45:45.760 --> 1:45:49.760]  a lot of times especially with his TSA people not just here but in Canada they will jump on
[1:45:49.760 --> 1:45:53.760]  the back of your neck with their knees and the neck breaks and then you've got a dead man and a dead woman
[1:45:53.760 --> 1:45:57.760]  and they say oh we don't know why they died their neck's broken
[1:45:57.760 --> 1:46:01.760]  I mean these men and women need to understand that jumping on someone
[1:46:01.760 --> 1:46:05.760]  with your knee can kill them
[1:46:05.760 --> 1:46:09.760]  absolutely and I'm just thankful to God that I'm alive
[1:46:09.760 --> 1:46:13.760]  and that I made it through the whole thing with the damage that I did instead of worse
[1:46:13.760 --> 1:46:17.760]  but another interesting thing that came out in the
[1:46:17.760 --> 1:46:21.760]  trial was that these guys were put on the stand and they kept lying
[1:46:21.760 --> 1:46:25.760]  on the stand and then we showed the jury the video
[1:46:25.760 --> 1:46:29.760]  that they were lying and I was just thinking to myself if I didn't have this video
[1:46:29.760 --> 1:46:33.760]  I would have been found guilty because the video was the only way we could prove
[1:46:33.760 --> 1:46:37.760]  that the testimony that they were giving was lies
[1:46:37.760 --> 1:46:41.760]  the video showed what really happened and for example
[1:46:41.760 --> 1:46:45.760]  the reason that I was clear of resisting an order is because the police never told me to move my car
[1:46:45.760 --> 1:46:49.760]  to secondary but he got on the witness stand and kept saying I told him to move his car
[1:46:49.760 --> 1:46:53.760]  and in reality he never did and the video proved that
[1:46:53.760 --> 1:46:57.760]  so you have to take a video camera everywhere you go apparently these days
[1:46:57.760 --> 1:47:01.760]  because they'll just get up and lie and that brings up the next issue
[1:47:01.760 --> 1:47:05.760]  12 states are misapplying the wiretapping law
[1:47:05.760 --> 1:47:09.760]  for those that don't know wiretapping is going up to somebody's house, jacking into their phone
[1:47:09.760 --> 1:47:13.760]  videotaping somebody through their windows but when you're in public there's no
[1:47:13.760 --> 1:47:17.760]  perception of privacy that's how they put up cameras on polls
[1:47:17.760 --> 1:47:21.760]  videotaping us now that's an issue the citizens supposedly run the government so we can decide
[1:47:21.760 --> 1:47:25.760]  to move those but that's how they claim they can put up microphones and cameras
[1:47:25.760 --> 1:47:29.760]  on street corners but now they're charging people all over the nation
[1:47:29.760 --> 1:47:33.760]  for videotaping police from hundreds of yards away when they shoot somebody in the back
[1:47:33.760 --> 1:47:37.760]  when they beat up a college kid for no reason because in every
[1:47:37.760 --> 1:47:41.760]  case you go look at the police report it'll lie about the victim
[1:47:41.760 --> 1:47:45.760]  and then they charge you and so they're really scared
[1:47:45.760 --> 1:47:49.760]  of video cameras being used and turned back against them
[1:47:49.760 --> 1:47:53.760]  absolutely and it's the most powerful tool to expose the truth
[1:47:53.760 --> 1:47:57.760]  because there were literally about three or four different things in the trial
[1:47:57.760 --> 1:48:01.760]  that were just blatantly contradicted by the video you know what they were saying did not
[1:48:01.760 --> 1:48:05.760]  line up with the video one of the interesting things too was it was a two day
[1:48:05.760 --> 1:48:09.760]  jury trial and on the second day of the trial one of the jurors showed up
[1:48:09.760 --> 1:48:13.760]  wearing like a pro america t-shirt with a flag on it
[1:48:13.760 --> 1:48:17.760]  that's when I knew I was going to be declared not guilty because these jurors
[1:48:17.760 --> 1:48:21.760]  understood what I was doing and one of them even thanked me as I was walking out of the courtroom
[1:48:21.760 --> 1:48:25.760]  and said thank you for standing up for our constitutional rights
[1:48:25.760 --> 1:48:29.760]  because if we give the government an inch they're going to take a mile and so
[1:48:29.760 --> 1:48:33.760]  thank you for drawing that line in the sand so this small town jury
[1:48:33.760 --> 1:48:37.760]  from Welton Arizona believed in what I was doing
[1:48:37.760 --> 1:48:41.760]  and keep in mind Alex this small town
[1:48:41.760 --> 1:48:45.760]  Welton where the jurors were pulled from is right near the
[1:48:45.760 --> 1:48:49.760]  border I mean we're talking you know I don't know exactly
[1:48:49.760 --> 1:48:53.760]  but it's very close to the board it's a lot closer to the border than the checkpoint is
[1:48:53.760 --> 1:48:57.760]  and through these checkpoints and they live right near the border
[1:48:57.760 --> 1:49:01.760]  and yet they said they don't like the checkpoint they said that it's
[1:49:01.760 --> 1:49:05.760]  out of control and that they as U.S. citizens get harassed and they believed
[1:49:05.760 --> 1:49:09.760]  in what I was doing and that's the power of jury nullification
[1:49:09.760 --> 1:49:13.760]  and grand jury nullification we elect the sheriff
[1:49:13.760 --> 1:49:17.760]  we elect the mayor we elect the legislature and we decide
[1:49:17.760 --> 1:49:21.760]  the facts and the law and they've tried to brainwash
[1:49:21.760 --> 1:49:25.760]  juries that that's not the case we don't just vote at the voting booth
[1:49:25.760 --> 1:49:29.760]  we vote at the grand juries and at the juries and we vote
[1:49:29.760 --> 1:49:33.760]  when we demonstrate and we vote when we say no and we are the
[1:49:33.760 --> 1:49:37.760]  government this is our republic our country and I've been
[1:49:37.760 --> 1:49:41.760]  specific I am against randomly pulling over people to ask
[1:49:41.760 --> 1:49:45.760]  if they're citizens that is evil and will be used against citizens
[1:49:45.760 --> 1:49:49.760]  and what's your view on the Arizona law because the way I read
[1:49:49.760 --> 1:49:53.760]  it it said somebody looks like they're drunk driving somebody's speeding we pull them over
[1:49:53.760 --> 1:49:57.760]  if they're any legal then we take them in the media
[1:49:57.760 --> 1:50:01.760]  spun this is a civil rights issue but I want to make sure that everybody
[1:50:01.760 --> 1:50:05.760]  is given due process well my
[1:50:05.760 --> 1:50:09.760]  personal view on the SB 1070 I'm against it because
[1:50:09.760 --> 1:50:13.760]  I think it further breaks down the separation of power though
[1:50:13.760 --> 1:50:17.760]  between local and federal law enforcement basically you know you're getting
[1:50:17.760 --> 1:50:21.760]  pulled over for a traffic ticket they're calling the feds
[1:50:21.760 --> 1:50:25.760]  and just checking whether you're a US citizen you know that's getting entered into some kind of
[1:50:25.760 --> 1:50:29.760]  a data but they already when they pull you over and I'm against it they run everybody through a database
[1:50:29.760 --> 1:50:33.760]  I know but the way I see it though just because they're already doing it
[1:50:33.760 --> 1:50:37.760]  it's still a police state you know and I see what you're saying
[1:50:37.760 --> 1:50:41.760]  the law is maybe really nothing new but at the same time
[1:50:41.760 --> 1:50:45.760]  I mean I'm going to be clear I'm not saying there's a
[1:50:45.760 --> 1:50:49.760]  my issue is they're getting rid of all the rights for citizens and then adding extra rights to illegals
[1:50:49.760 --> 1:50:53.760]  because it's part of the globalist overall program stay with us

[1:54:23.760 --> 1:54:27.760]  all of it 800-259-9231
[1:54:27.760 --> 1:54:31.760]  we'll be taking your phone calls but I wanted to give a pastor Stephen Anderson
[1:54:31.760 --> 1:54:35.760]  a chance to finish up any points he wanted to make but I had one more question pastor
[1:54:35.760 --> 1:54:39.760]  and that's this how is your civil suit going
[1:54:39.760 --> 1:54:43.760]  against them and who are you suing specifically well I'm pretty much suing
[1:54:43.760 --> 1:54:47.760]  everyone involved the United States of America the Department of Homeland
[1:54:47.760 --> 1:54:51.760]  Security the border patrol the state of Arizona the DPS which is
[1:54:51.760 --> 1:54:55.760]  the state police and then all the individual agents and police officers involved
[1:54:55.760 --> 1:54:59.760]  and we're suing on five different counts one of them is
[1:54:59.760 --> 1:55:03.760]  of course the 1983 statute about a deprivation
[1:55:03.760 --> 1:55:07.760]  of constitutional rights we're suing them for assault and battery
[1:55:07.760 --> 1:55:11.760]  wrongful arrest and imprisonment negligence and or gross negligence
[1:55:11.760 --> 1:55:15.760]  and intentional affliction of emotional distress
[1:55:15.760 --> 1:55:19.760]  so those are the five counts and the lawsuit's been filed I think it's just
[1:55:19.760 --> 1:55:23.760]  a really slow process so I don't really know how long it's going to take
[1:55:23.760 --> 1:55:27.760]  but I think it just kind of takes forever well that strengthens your case
[1:55:27.760 --> 1:55:31.760]  for those that aren't aware of that that you've now been found not guilty
[1:55:31.760 --> 1:55:35.760]  oh definitely I mean I still had a case even if I would have been found guilty of these traffic charges
[1:55:35.760 --> 1:55:39.760]  but either way it definitely strengthens the wrongful
[1:55:39.760 --> 1:55:43.760]  imprisonment when I was declared by a jury of my peers to be not guilty
[1:55:43.760 --> 1:55:47.760]  so I've been cleared of all wrongdoing and it's the final decision and so now
[1:55:47.760 --> 1:55:51.760]  you know we can go after them because I need to recover
[1:55:51.760 --> 1:55:55.760]  some of my losses and we need to set a precedent here that they are going to have
[1:55:55.760 --> 1:55:59.760]  consequences if they just beat and tase or an innocent person just because
[1:55:59.760 --> 1:56:03.760]  they're emotional about some of the things that I said to them or past
[1:56:03.760 --> 1:56:07.760]  videos that I've made on YouTube well they've got this Homeland Security
[1:56:07.760 --> 1:56:11.760]  Zone for three years 100 miles in and in some cases
[1:56:11.760 --> 1:56:15.760]  100 miles in they're searching people they leave the illegals alone but harassed
[1:56:15.760 --> 1:56:19.760]  citizens so I think the point that some Arizonans who were against the open borders
[1:56:19.760 --> 1:56:23.760]  but for the Fourth Amendment have made that that the bill will be used against
[1:56:23.760 --> 1:56:27.760]  them and and and not against the illegals and I think that that
[1:56:27.760 --> 1:56:31.760]  is a good point that's been made overall and I think Judge Andrew DePaulitano has made
[1:56:31.760 --> 1:56:35.760]  that point as well. Pastor Stephen Anderson thank you for joining us
[1:56:35.760 --> 1:56:39.760]  thank you I appreciate the time we appreciate you now I'm going to start the
[1:56:39.760 --> 1:56:43.760]  third hour here in a moment and we're going to get
[1:56:43.760 --> 1:56:47.760]  into your calls first but then I'm going to also get into
[1:56:47.760 --> 1:56:51.760]  Google is being now getting into criminal trouble in Spain and Italy
[1:56:51.760 --> 1:56:55.760]  and others for surveilling people without warrants as they should get in trouble for it
[1:56:55.760 --> 1:56:59.760]  here we've got a video coming out tomorrow for prisonplanet.tv
[1:56:59.760 --> 1:57:03.760]  members a 15 minute breakdown of all this today
[1:57:03.760 --> 1:57:07.760]  we posted the Jesse Ventura interview it's premiering at
[1:57:07.760 --> 1:57:11.760]  prisonplanet.tv it's been up for about an hour in three different formats for folks
[1:57:11.760 --> 1:57:15.760]  Jesse Ventura talks about Homeland Security Gestapo, Hollywood Secrets
[1:57:15.760 --> 1:57:19.760]  and more when he was here interviewing me on
[1:57:19.760 --> 1:57:23.760]  Thursday while we were out driving around doing investigations into FEMA camps and things
[1:57:23.760 --> 1:57:27.760]  we didn't get into that in the interview that's for the TV show but we got into a host of
[1:57:27.760 --> 1:57:31.760]  other issues I think this is one of our best interviews with Governor
[1:57:31.760 --> 1:57:35.760]  Jesse Ventura great job to Aaron Dyke shooting the video
[1:57:35.760 --> 1:57:39.760]  even though we were driving around in Westlake on bumpy roads and adding documents
[1:57:39.760 --> 1:57:43.760]  and video clips Aaron just is like becoming a more and more amazing

[2:00:55.760 --> 2:00:59.760]  in Japan Lisa thanks for holding hi Alex
[2:00:59.760 --> 2:01:03.760]  I'm calling about a story in the Okinawa Marine Newspaper the
[2:01:03.760 --> 2:01:07.760]  headline is WikiLeaks website not authorized I'm not sure if you've
[2:01:07.760 --> 2:01:11.760]  heard about it no are you saying that Japan is now blocking
[2:01:11.760 --> 2:01:15.760]  WikiLeaks no basically what the article says
[2:01:15.760 --> 2:01:19.760]  is this just came out on August 13th and it's the front page
[2:01:19.760 --> 2:01:23.760]  and basically the article says that any service members who are
[2:01:23.760 --> 2:01:27.760]  found to have viewed or downloaded the WikiLeaks video will result in a variety
[2:01:27.760 --> 2:01:31.760]  of repercussions from non-judicial punishment to court
[2:01:31.760 --> 2:01:35.760]  Marshall and that it will be a career ender if you're
[2:01:35.760 --> 2:01:39.760]  not found to have viewed the video well that's what cyber security says
[2:01:39.760 --> 2:01:43.760]  it says they're going to recruit one million high school seniors
[2:01:43.760 --> 2:01:47.760]  a year this is this is in the cyber security act it's past the house and is in the senate
[2:01:47.760 --> 2:01:51.760]  it says one million a year to form a giant
[2:01:51.760 --> 2:01:55.760]  army taxpayer paid for to surveil
[2:01:55.760 --> 2:01:59.760]  the web to post fake blogs to counter the
[2:01:59.760 --> 2:02:03.760]  alternative media with a quote government megaphone and it says that
[2:02:03.760 --> 2:02:07.760]  you're going to start harassing and persecuting government employees
[2:02:07.760 --> 2:02:11.760]  for their political speech online in fact the Travis County was in the news
[2:02:11.760 --> 2:02:15.760]  yesterday actually a four county area arted on local MPR
[2:02:15.760 --> 2:02:19.760]  and of course some county people were complaining saying you're not
[2:02:19.760 --> 2:02:23.760]  allowed to even mildly criticize anyone in government
[2:02:23.760 --> 2:02:27.760]  period when you work for the county and it's four counties doing this
[2:02:27.760 --> 2:02:31.760]  and the point is yeah if you're in private business
[2:02:31.760 --> 2:02:35.760]  you can get fired for criticizing your company because
[2:02:35.760 --> 2:02:39.760]  it's a free will
[2:02:39.760 --> 2:02:43.760]  system of free market or at will state
[2:02:43.760 --> 2:02:47.760]  most states are that way but when it's the government
[2:02:47.760 --> 2:02:51.760]  you're working for the government you're a citizen you don't lose your rights
[2:02:51.760 --> 2:02:55.760]  and as long as you don't give out any information that's proprietary
[2:02:55.760 --> 2:02:59.760]  or that someone else's private info you have a right to organize
[2:02:59.760 --> 2:03:03.760]  be political to march to write articles
[2:03:03.760 --> 2:03:07.760]  and so yes they're moving but you're saying they're threatening the military
[2:03:07.760 --> 2:03:11.760]  if they visit WikiLeaks
[2:03:11.760 --> 2:03:15.760]  yes even if it's from your home computer that it's
[2:03:15.760 --> 2:03:19.760]  even more detrimental to a service members career because it's basically
[2:03:19.760 --> 2:03:23.760]  saying that you try to seek out
[2:03:23.760 --> 2:03:27.760]  the information and that unless you have a specific clearance authority
[2:03:27.760 --> 2:03:31.760]  that nobody is allowed to watch it even if it's on television
[2:03:31.760 --> 2:03:35.760]  well we pulled up WLTX
[2:03:35.760 --> 2:03:39.760]  television saying the same thing here in the United States that
[2:03:39.760 --> 2:03:43.760]  if you're in the military they're gonna you can be court
[2:03:43.760 --> 2:03:47.760]  marshal or kicked out of the military or reprimanded it's on that sliding scale
[2:03:47.760 --> 2:03:51.760]  if you do and so that's confirmed and
[2:03:51.760 --> 2:03:55.760]  the overall message here is we're watching you
[2:03:55.760 --> 2:03:59.760]  even at home we're watching you even when you're not at the base
[2:03:59.760 --> 2:04:03.760]  yep exactly and
[2:04:03.760 --> 2:04:07.760]  I can tell you right now as a spouse
[2:04:07.760 --> 2:04:11.760]  of a military member people are not
[2:04:11.760 --> 2:04:15.760]  impressed with the handling of how the WikiLeaks
[2:04:15.760 --> 2:04:19.760]  went over
[2:04:19.760 --> 2:04:23.760]  so it sounds like you're in the military
[2:04:23.760 --> 2:04:27.760]  military stuff
[2:04:27.760 --> 2:04:31.760]  and so maybe you're not even supposed to call into the radio with your political use
[2:04:31.760 --> 2:04:35.760]  maybe you're supposed to just shut up I guess that's the new America
[2:04:35.760 --> 2:04:39.760]  yeah we'll see what happens
[2:04:39.760 --> 2:04:43.760]  well that's why I love taking calls she brought something to our attention I wasn't aware of

[2:10:33.760 --> 2:10:37.760]  Donna Debbie thanks for holding
[2:10:37.760 --> 2:10:41.760]  hi I'm glad to finally get on here
[2:10:41.760 --> 2:10:45.760]  my issue is my children's school has decided that to dismiss
[2:10:45.760 --> 2:10:49.760]  students they will now dismiss them with a number
[2:10:49.760 --> 2:10:53.760]  if you have to pick up your child a number will be broadcast
[2:10:53.760 --> 2:10:57.760]  over the PA system for your child
[2:10:57.760 --> 2:11:01.760]  to have them meet you at the front desk
[2:11:01.760 --> 2:11:05.760]  where lanyards around their neck with barcodes
[2:11:05.760 --> 2:11:09.760]  and one school in Louisiana defeated it a few years ago because the kids pointed out they could learn to
[2:11:09.760 --> 2:11:13.760]  read them and it was their social security number and they're training them with checkpoints
[2:11:13.760 --> 2:11:17.760]  and drug dogs and now you're a number like you're a prisoner
[2:11:17.760 --> 2:11:21.760]  exactly and I am I actually when I
[2:11:21.760 --> 2:11:25.760]  complained to one of the teachers who is also a politician
[2:11:25.760 --> 2:11:29.760]  he turned around and gave me the exact same
[2:11:29.760 --> 2:11:33.760]  speech that President W. Bush
[2:11:33.760 --> 2:11:37.760]  gave with the Patriot Act it's for the safety
[2:11:37.760 --> 2:11:41.760]  and I'm looking going how is it for safety
[2:11:41.760 --> 2:11:45.760]  when you're training children to be inmates
[2:11:45.760 --> 2:11:49.760]  that is all it is is training children to be inmates
[2:11:49.760 --> 2:11:53.760]  and an institution
[2:11:53.760 --> 2:11:57.760]  you're absolutely you're absolutely right you need to go to the city council
[2:11:57.760 --> 2:12:01.760]  you need to go to the school board and explain to them that your child
[2:12:01.760 --> 2:12:05.760]  is not a number
[2:12:05.760 --> 2:12:09.760]  there's a school board meeting tonight and I've been trying to get it out to everybody
[2:12:09.760 --> 2:12:13.760]  that I can I've called the news station which
[2:12:13.760 --> 2:12:17.760]  surprisingly enough a CVS affiliate I called
[2:12:17.760 --> 2:12:21.760]  they seemed really concerned about it but yet nothing has been said since
[2:12:21.760 --> 2:12:25.760]  yesterday when I called them and
[2:12:25.760 --> 2:12:29.760]  I strongly do not believe anything is going to come of it on
[2:12:29.760 --> 2:12:33.760]  that route however I asked
[2:12:33.760 --> 2:12:37.760]  when I asked the principal yesterday when the next school board meeting is
[2:12:37.760 --> 2:12:41.760]  he looks at me and tells me well there's one tomorrow night
[2:12:41.760 --> 2:12:45.760]  at 6 p.m. okay and he then tells me
[2:12:45.760 --> 2:12:49.760]  it's posted all over the school I had to go in wait 23
[2:12:49.760 --> 2:12:53.760]  minutes to pick up my children I did not see one
[2:12:53.760 --> 2:12:57.760]  posting of this meeting and it is a charter school
[2:12:57.760 --> 2:13:01.760]  that's another thing they do is a lot of schools the parents
[2:13:01.760 --> 2:13:05.760]  coming to this gated fenced area they've got to have an ID they've got to be biometrically
[2:13:05.760 --> 2:13:09.760]  thumb printed like their prisoners and have their background
[2:13:09.760 --> 2:13:13.760]  run to be able to even get in to see their children
[2:13:13.760 --> 2:13:17.760]  the state is quietly taking over what did the California government
[2:13:17.760 --> 2:13:21.760]  and courts rule it got overturned thank god two years ago
[2:13:21.760 --> 2:13:25.760]  but two years ago they ruled it got overturned about a year later that the state
[2:13:25.760 --> 2:13:29.760]  actually owns your children has more rights over them and then homeschooling is illegal
[2:13:29.760 --> 2:13:33.760]  well that got defeated they want to take over the family it's their stated
[2:13:33.760 --> 2:13:37.760]  goal Debbie thank you for the call let's talk to Sean in Texas you're on the air Sean
[2:13:37.760 --> 2:13:41.760]  yes sir Alice Jones how's it going I live down here
[2:13:41.760 --> 2:13:45.760]  in Corpus and there was a family here a couple days ago that purchased
[2:13:45.760 --> 2:13:49.760]  some I guess some hamburger patties from the local HEP grocery store
[2:13:49.760 --> 2:13:53.760]  I don't know if you're hopeful hopefully you've seen this but they were cooking it
[2:13:53.760 --> 2:13:57.760]  and literally the mercury just started pouring out of the burgers and they had two kids
[2:13:57.760 --> 2:14:01.760]  that are you know they got sick or whatever and I mean you can see the footage
[2:14:01.760 --> 2:14:05.760]  on the I guess you like KZTV.com or something like that
[2:14:05.760 --> 2:14:09.760]  and you need to check out this footage sorry I'm really nervous but
[2:14:09.760 --> 2:14:13.760]  pretty wild what's the name of the video
[2:14:13.760 --> 2:14:17.760]  I'm not sure I don't even have a computer I just listen to you as much as I can you know I'm a local affiliate
[2:14:17.760 --> 2:14:21.760]  it's but I just was watching the news and it was the
[2:14:21.760 --> 2:14:25.760]  CVS affiliate the local CVS affiliate. By the way I mean literally we've gained so many affiliates
[2:14:25.760 --> 2:14:29.760]  in the last year I know we've been on for over a year now in Corpus Christi
[2:14:29.760 --> 2:14:33.760]  and I enjoy listening to the shows and I'm on vacation here in the
[2:14:33.760 --> 2:14:37.760]  rebroadcast down there because I go to Port Aransas my favorite place on the
[2:14:37.760 --> 2:14:41.760]  coast great place to visit great people down there Sean
[2:14:41.760 --> 2:14:45.760]  what's the affiliate to call letters and a number
[2:14:45.760 --> 2:14:49.760]  for me that's the I'm pretty sure that's what it is it's the local CVS
[2:14:49.760 --> 2:14:53.760]  affiliate and they literally have the
[2:14:53.760 --> 2:14:57.760]  mercury in a plastic. No what I'm saying is we're on the radio in Corpus Christi
[2:14:57.760 --> 2:15:01.760]  I'm off the top of my head I don't have it in front of me what's the affiliate
[2:15:01.760 --> 2:15:05.760]  oh it's a 1440 key is that what it is what you're talking about
[2:15:05.760 --> 2:15:09.760]  I don't have the full list in front of me that's something that Genesis has never compiled properly
[2:15:09.760 --> 2:15:13.760]  they got an old list out but I'm going to I wanted to plug
[2:15:13.760 --> 2:15:17.760]  into the station. Oh yes sir yes sir and I have and I've been
[2:15:17.760 --> 2:15:21.760]  trying to get my girlfriend to live through a little bit and and then she saw the footage on and she freaked out
[2:15:21.760 --> 2:15:25.760]  she's like oh my gosh she is right you know and I was like see I mean the stuff's really going on
[2:15:25.760 --> 2:15:29.760]  I haven't seen this but I want to see you absolutely have to see because
[2:15:29.760 --> 2:15:33.760]  what did they say mercury and hamburger patties Corpus Christi
[2:15:33.760 --> 2:15:37.760]  yeah it was HEB and they said it was an isolated incident and they have no
[2:15:37.760 --> 2:15:41.760]  you know they're not worried about much but they took off uh they had a recall in their
[2:15:41.760 --> 2:15:45.760]  patties or something like that well that's insane that's insane but it's absolutely brushed underneath
[2:15:45.760 --> 2:15:49.760]  brushed underneath you know Sean we found it we found it
[2:15:49.760 --> 2:15:53.760]  I'm going to have to watch it during the break but we'll look at it my issue is
[2:15:53.760 --> 2:15:57.760]  well there's so many issues and we covered it in through the ultimate
[2:15:57.760 --> 2:16:01.760]  secret expose that 15 minute video that we posted on
[2:16:01.760 --> 2:16:05.760]  YouTube it's had over a half million views as a public service announcement it's so
[2:16:05.760 --> 2:16:09.760]  important that be gotten out to people that they have distillates
[2:16:09.760 --> 2:16:13.760]  and the oil companies when they refine crude
[2:16:13.760 --> 2:16:17.760]  oil a large percentage of it is unusable
[2:16:17.760 --> 2:16:21.760]  and so they distill it out to be Vaseline
[2:16:21.760 --> 2:16:25.760]  and to be coke for the
[2:16:25.760 --> 2:16:29.760]  steel mills I mean hundreds of different distillates
[2:16:29.760 --> 2:16:33.760]  phosphorus
[2:16:33.760 --> 2:16:37.760]  things like sulfur for the tips of matches this all comes out of the oil
[2:16:37.760 --> 2:16:41.760]  and they take the majority of it and put it into fertilizer
[2:16:41.760 --> 2:16:45.760]  for crops and it's full of mercury lead arsenic benzene
[2:16:45.760 --> 2:16:49.760]  and then they spray it on crops and crops are
[2:16:49.760 --> 2:16:53.760]  very good at sucking up these chemicals and poisons and heavy metals
[2:16:53.760 --> 2:16:57.760]  and then you eat it you then eat it
[2:16:57.760 --> 2:17:01.760]  and that's why according to the Washington Post around half of the
[2:17:01.760 --> 2:17:05.760]  major corn syrup products they tested had high levels of mercury
[2:17:05.760 --> 2:17:09.760]  high levels it's in the corn
[2:17:09.760 --> 2:17:13.760]  and what three years ago they approved and now it's used all over
[2:17:13.760 --> 2:17:17.760]  sodium fluoride as a
[2:17:17.760 --> 2:17:21.760]  spray
[2:17:21.760 --> 2:17:25.760]  as a pesticide to be put
[2:17:25.760 --> 2:17:29.760]  on the crops well it goes right through the cell wall
[2:17:29.760 --> 2:17:33.760]  it bio accumulates is the term it builds up
[2:17:33.760 --> 2:17:37.760]  in the corn in the wheat in the sugar beads
[2:17:37.760 --> 2:17:41.760]  and all these other plants all these other crops the tomatoes
[2:17:41.760 --> 2:17:45.760]  whatever the case is I mean it's used on everything and then you are eating this
[2:17:45.760 --> 2:17:49.760]  so eat your vegetables yeah it should be good but it's not
[2:17:49.760 --> 2:17:53.760]  and they also feed the corn and things in the feeds to cows
[2:17:53.760 --> 2:17:57.760]  and
[2:17:57.760 --> 2:18:01.760]  the cows then bio accumulate this over
[2:18:01.760 --> 2:18:05.760]  five years while they're getting fattened up and then you eat a steak or hamburger
[2:18:05.760 --> 2:18:09.760]  or whatever it is it's full of this now this hasn't been proven yet I see the newscast
[2:18:09.760 --> 2:18:13.760]  on screen you know H.E.B. says they're going to test it
[2:18:13.760 --> 2:18:17.760]  but so we'll see what happens there I mean I
[2:18:17.760 --> 2:18:21.760]  if it is true it's their supplier and God knows what's happened look
[2:18:21.760 --> 2:18:25.760]  our food supply system is a joke because the big mega companies
[2:18:25.760 --> 2:18:29.760]  I've seen the numbers years ago in USA Today
[2:18:29.760 --> 2:18:33.760]  about Tyson and Tyson's got more than two-thirds of global
[2:18:33.760 --> 2:18:37.760]  poultry production they're moving in to take over hogs
[2:18:37.760 --> 2:18:41.760]  and to take over beef packing
[2:18:41.760 --> 2:18:45.760]  and they make payments to the politicians
[2:18:45.760 --> 2:18:49.760]  legalized bribery with the campaign contributions and I've seen cases where they can have
[2:18:49.760 --> 2:18:53.760]  hundreds of violations per plant and don't get in trouble
[2:18:53.760 --> 2:18:57.760]  but then their competition gets one violation they get shut down
[2:18:57.760 --> 2:19:01.760]  and so yes the food the water
[2:19:01.760 --> 2:19:05.760]  all of it it is a nightmare it is a joke and then you've got the drugs
[2:19:05.760 --> 2:19:09.760]  they're giving the cows and the pigs and the chickens and the
[2:19:09.760 --> 2:19:13.760]  antibiotics that then create super bugs within the
[2:19:13.760 --> 2:19:17.760]  poultry yards within the poultry buildings
[2:19:17.760 --> 2:19:21.760]  within the feed lots and all of this is being passed on to humans
[2:19:21.760 --> 2:19:25.760]  and you know what we may have to pay a little more for meat
[2:19:25.760 --> 2:19:29.760]  meant to pay a little more for vegetables and you will pay more not
[2:19:29.760 --> 2:19:33.760]  eating poison but we need to do this you know that there's a reason Americans
[2:19:33.760 --> 2:19:37.760]  are eating the same type of junk they were eating 20-30 years ago but we're getting
[2:19:37.760 --> 2:19:41.760]  fatter we're getting more unhealthy we're getting more cancer we're getting more disease even though
[2:19:41.760 --> 2:19:45.760]  we're eating about the same calories I've looked at the studies we were two decades ago
[2:19:45.760 --> 2:19:49.760]  it's not how much we're eating it's what we're eating
[2:19:49.760 --> 2:19:53.760]  okay it's full of poison we'll be right back with

[2:24:11.760 --> 2:24:15.760]  K-E-Y-S 1440 a.m. in Corpus Christi that carries us 6 days a week by the way
[2:24:15.760 --> 2:24:19.760]  it was correct it was on the local news that
[2:24:19.760 --> 2:24:23.760]  what is reported to be mercury was just pouring out of these hamburgers
[2:24:23.760 --> 2:24:27.760]  that doesn't sound like something will come from the manufacturer H-E-B
[2:24:27.760 --> 2:24:31.760]  might be like with Tylenol where they had that sabotage by somebody along
[2:24:31.760 --> 2:24:35.760]  the line let's go ahead and play this short newscast here it is
[2:24:35.760 --> 2:24:39.760]  it tells action 10 news they found mercury in their meat while cooking hamburgers last night
[2:24:39.760 --> 2:24:43.760]  they claimed two of their boys got sick from the toxic chemical and after
[2:24:43.760 --> 2:24:47.760]  returning from the doctor's office today they called police take a look at this video
[2:24:47.760 --> 2:24:51.760]  the family claims this silvery fluid material came seeping out
[2:24:51.760 --> 2:24:55.760]  of their hamburger patties bought at H-E-B as they were cooking it
[2:24:55.760 --> 2:24:59.760]  Sunday night the family called poison control last night after
[2:24:59.760 --> 2:25:03.760]  their two sons ages 13 and 17 got sick and today they called police to come out
[2:25:03.760 --> 2:25:07.760]  and document the scene crime scene text took photos of all the remaining
[2:25:07.760 --> 2:25:11.760]  meat as well as the freezer inside the home the family told us
[2:25:11.760 --> 2:25:15.760]  they were not 100% sure it is mercury they just don't know what else it could be
[2:25:15.760 --> 2:25:19.760]  I put the patty on a little bitty plate and took it to my daughter's room
[2:25:19.760 --> 2:25:23.760]  and showed it to her and she goes oh my goodness this is mercury
[2:25:23.760 --> 2:25:27.760]  it was silver silver little balls
[2:25:27.760 --> 2:25:31.760]  like I don't know like liquid it was kind of liquid but I mean you know liquid
[2:25:31.760 --> 2:25:35.760]  like liquid middle or something but it was mercury I mean you've seen mercury before
[2:25:35.760 --> 2:25:39.760]  you know some mistakes some mistake boys are doing okay tonight
[2:25:39.760 --> 2:25:43.760]  here's what H-E-B told us this evening all 10 pound bags of ground beef
[2:25:43.760 --> 2:25:47.760]  like the two that were supposedly sold to the family on August 8th
[2:25:47.760 --> 2:25:51.760]  have been pulled from the shelves at the H-E-B store at Alameda and Robert
[2:25:51.760 --> 2:25:55.760]  where the family claims it came from the family did take some of the meat back to the store
[2:25:55.760 --> 2:25:59.760]  on Sunday after cooking it and although they no longer had
[2:25:59.760 --> 2:26:03.760]  the original packaging it came in H-E-B has sent that sample
[2:26:03.760 --> 2:26:07.760]  off at their quality assurance division in San Antonio H-E-B
[2:26:07.760 --> 2:26:11.760]  also says they are working closely with the family to find out if there
[2:26:11.760 --> 2:26:15.760]  really was mercury in the meat and how it might have gotten in there
[2:26:15.760 --> 2:26:19.760]  if it was there. Okay you can go online and watch the rest of the
[2:26:19.760 --> 2:26:23.760]  action 10 news so there you have it another call we're bringing up an
[2:26:23.760 --> 2:26:27.760]  interesting issue that's why I love the calls they take us in interesting directions
[2:26:27.760 --> 2:26:31.760]  I have another clip before I go back to your calls I mean what's the problem
[2:26:31.760 --> 2:26:35.760]  what's the problem if it reportedly has mercury in it
[2:26:35.760 --> 2:26:39.760]  according to national newscast on CBS and local newscast here in Austin
[2:26:39.760 --> 2:26:43.760]  in the federal government mercury is now good for your children's brains
[2:26:43.760 --> 2:26:47.760]  and I guess the mercury in the H1N1 shot causing a
[2:26:47.760 --> 2:26:51.760]  10 fold according to the London Telegraph in convulsions in children
[2:26:51.760 --> 2:26:55.760]  I guess it's a good thing remember that clip we've played
[2:26:55.760 --> 2:26:59.760]  countless times here on air
[2:26:59.760 --> 2:27:03.760]  where they say that mercury containing vaccines actually help children's
[2:27:03.760 --> 2:27:07.760]  neurological development not harm it and then we have
[2:27:07.760 --> 2:27:11.760]  an MSNBC show saying lead in toys is good for your
[2:27:11.760 --> 2:27:15.760]  children I mean this sounds completely insane but you can just go to YouTube
[2:27:15.760 --> 2:27:19.760]  and type in MSNBC says lead good
[2:27:19.760 --> 2:27:23.760]  or you can go to YouTube and type in mercury vaccines
[2:27:23.760 --> 2:27:35.760]  and they'll tell you how great it is here it is
[2:27:35.760 --> 2:27:39.760]  here's tonight's medical headlines with medical watch reporters
[2:27:39.760 --> 2:27:43.760]  mercury containing vaccines may help
[2:27:43.760 --> 2:27:47.760]  not harm kids according to two new studies in the journal pediatrics
[2:27:47.760 --> 2:27:51.760]  there have been widespread concerns that mercury based preservatives and vaccines
[2:27:51.760 --> 2:27:55.760]  might impair the neurological development of children these new studies suggest
[2:27:55.760 --> 2:27:59.760]  that the opposite that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved
[2:27:59.760 --> 2:28:03.760]  behavior and mental performance um and they're now saying lithium
[2:28:03.760 --> 2:28:07.760]  a toxic metal that brain damages you needs to be put in the water
[2:28:07.760 --> 2:28:11.760]  it'll help you it will improve you and they got
[2:28:11.760 --> 2:28:15.760]  new vaccines that will eat parts of your brain to make you be more passive
[2:28:15.760 --> 2:28:19.760]  and this is an improvement the government said so so we need to take it
[2:28:19.760 --> 2:28:23.760]  and I'm the conspiracy theorist because I think mercury's bad for you let's talk to
[2:28:23.760 --> 2:28:27.760]  David in Florida David you're on the air welcome
[2:28:27.760 --> 2:28:31.760]  hey Alex um uh finally good to talk to you again um yeah I was calling it
[2:28:31.760 --> 2:28:35.760]  first invite you to Florida for uh you know cookout I've got some uh
[2:28:35.760 --> 2:28:39.760]  I've got some uh mercury marinated burgers and we're going to be
[2:28:39.760 --> 2:28:43.760]  seasoning them with some fluoride so um you come on down and bring your bun at all
[2:28:43.760 --> 2:28:47.760]  but uh well you're a good patriot yeah I mean that's good and of course the buns
[2:28:47.760 --> 2:28:51.760]  most of them have uh high fructose corn syrup full of mercury in them so that's
[2:28:51.760 --> 2:28:54.960]  good you're a good patriot we've got lithium
[2:28:54.960 --> 2:28:58.960]  seeds to top it off so um but anyway the the main reason I call
[2:28:58.960 --> 2:29:03.360]  was uh to to take issue with you now 95 percent of the time you know I believe
[2:29:03.360 --> 2:29:07.760]  you're dead on uh but this is a long thing um you know
[2:29:07.760 --> 2:29:11.760]  it it doesn't just go back to the 50s it just doesn't go back to
[2:29:11.760 --> 2:29:15.760]  the the teens where they were trying to abstain from
[2:29:15.760 --> 2:29:18.800]  the League of Nations this goes all the way back
[2:29:18.800 --> 2:29:23.760]  to actually they were the actually the first enemy that we had as a nation
[2:29:23.760 --> 2:29:27.440]  um well sure I mean I mean the Leathernecks the Marines were sent
[2:29:27.440 --> 2:29:33.840]  to the Mediterranean uh where uh the uh Muslim fleets were robbing our ships
[2:29:33.840 --> 2:29:37.520]  and that took a decade to beat them but look stay there we'll come back and
[2:29:37.520 --> 2:29:41.600]  talk about Islam uh with you David and Florida on the other side we've got a
[2:29:41.600 --> 2:29:44.800]  break as their free program breaks and then we'll go to everybody else on the
[2:29:44.800 --> 2:29:47.920]  other side long segment coming up I'm Alex Jones

[2:30:03.680 --> 2:30:07.760]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[2:30:07.760 --> 2:30:11.680]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[2:30:11.680 --> 2:30:15.120]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[2:30:15.120 --> 2:30:18.000]  it's true total government control of electricity
[2:30:18.000 --> 2:30:21.520]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three
[2:30:21.520 --> 2:30:25.120]  in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[2:30:25.120 --> 2:30:29.040]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[2:30:29.040 --> 2:30:32.640]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[2:30:32.640 --> 2:30:35.680]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related

[2:32:05.200 --> 2:32:10.880]  what have we got a republic or a monarchy a republic is based on a constitution
[2:32:10.880 --> 2:32:14.560]  which protects minority rights not democracy not mob rule
[2:32:14.560 --> 2:32:17.520]  two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner so they think they own our

[2:33:06.320 --> 2:33:09.440]  we are back live
[2:33:10.000 --> 2:33:14.160]  here's another report artificial meat may feed the planet
[2:33:14.160 --> 2:33:17.520]  scientists say and they say because of overpopulation
[2:33:17.520 --> 2:33:20.560]  they may start growing artificial meat in vats
[2:33:20.560 --> 2:33:25.920]  and fox news has that image of the luscious artificial meat
[2:33:25.920 --> 2:33:30.560]  and then there's another report here out of the mail online
[2:33:30.560 --> 2:33:34.400]  where they talk about because of overpopulation
[2:33:34.400 --> 2:33:38.480]  they may have to do this because it's also immoral to eat meat
[2:33:38.480 --> 2:33:44.560]  and so this is part of the green technology economy which again gives
[2:33:44.560 --> 2:33:48.000]  the scientific elite total control where you won't be able to
[2:33:48.000 --> 2:33:52.240]  have your own cows or grow your own crops everything will be gmo everything
[2:33:52.240 --> 2:33:57.040]  patented by the globalist it's incredible
[2:33:57.040 --> 2:34:00.640]  let's go ahead and take another call well now let's finish up with david
[2:34:00.640 --> 2:34:05.360]  in florida david if you just joined us was saying that he disagrees with me
[2:34:05.360 --> 2:34:10.320]  about islam and so tell me david what you think my
[2:34:10.320 --> 2:34:15.920]  views on islam are because you know there are a thousand
[2:34:15.920 --> 2:34:20.720]  probably ten thousand or more radio shows blogs maybe a hundred thousand
[2:34:20.720 --> 2:34:25.840]  now that i think about it globally of people arguing hundreds of different
[2:34:25.840 --> 2:34:31.520]  sex of you know in groups of christians scores of groups with muslims
[2:34:31.520 --> 2:34:34.800]  everyone fighting with each other everyone's got the answer
[2:34:34.800 --> 2:34:38.400]  everyone wants to take over the other group reportedly
[2:34:38.400 --> 2:34:41.600]  uh... and it just becomes a giant political
[2:34:41.600 --> 2:34:45.760]  football but i mean if you disagree with me then boil down what you think my
[2:34:45.760 --> 2:34:50.400]  views on islam are well the views on islam that you have
[2:34:50.400 --> 2:34:55.040]  i mean it it's just one word you i don't know i can't see you have a habit
[2:34:55.040 --> 2:34:57.520]  but you probably don't know who they say they are
[2:34:57.520 --> 2:35:03.040]  see they say they they say who they are in their book which is the caron
[2:35:03.040 --> 2:35:06.400]  their book tells them that they have to do such such as such
[2:35:06.400 --> 2:35:11.040]  in order for them to be in position to be acceptable by a lot
[2:35:11.040 --> 2:35:16.080]  there are certain things that they can do i.e die in jihad that grant them
[2:35:16.080 --> 2:35:19.760]  immediate access to paradise where they get to seventy virgins etc
[2:35:19.760 --> 2:35:24.000]  i know about that okay but i mean what's my view that you disagree with i mean
[2:35:24.000 --> 2:35:27.200]  well the part about your views you're saying oh well you know there's
[2:35:27.200 --> 2:35:29.840]  some moderate there's no such thing as a moderate muslim
[2:35:29.840 --> 2:35:33.360]  first of all that doesn't exist a moderate muslim
[2:35:33.360 --> 2:35:37.120]  is the equivalent of a christian who fornicates who
[2:35:37.120 --> 2:35:40.720]  smokes and drinks who cusses who cheat to business
[2:35:40.720 --> 2:35:45.280]  and all that okay that that's not really well listen what i'm trying to get at
[2:35:45.280 --> 2:35:46.480]  here
[2:35:46.480 --> 2:35:50.480]  is i simply pointed out that i understand why people are upset about the
[2:35:50.480 --> 2:35:54.880]  musket ground zero but this is multiculturalism we were a christian
[2:35:54.880 --> 2:35:58.160]  country we've decided to get rid of the family
[2:35:58.160 --> 2:36:02.080]  attack christianity and anything that's anti christian
[2:36:02.080 --> 2:36:07.440]  is good for now because the globalists are using the open borders all of it
[2:36:07.440 --> 2:36:12.320]  to balkanize this country so we can have divide and conquer i'm a christian
[2:36:12.320 --> 2:36:16.080]  but i'm non-denominational i don't get involved in all this fighting
[2:36:16.080 --> 2:36:20.880]  and i have a news broadcast and people are always calling me saying
[2:36:20.880 --> 2:36:24.320]  you know uh criticize this group criticize that group
[2:36:24.320 --> 2:36:28.160]  look i'm against these wars and they point out i mean look at
[2:36:28.160 --> 2:36:31.680]  saudi arabia is our big ally they're one of the most oppressive
[2:36:31.680 --> 2:36:36.080]  muslim nations out there and i disagree with it and i criticize
[2:36:36.080 --> 2:36:39.120]  that variant of islam i mean that certainly is
[2:36:39.120 --> 2:36:44.400]  uh you know a very oppressive state and and uh
[2:36:44.400 --> 2:36:48.400]  my whole issue here is i just this is not a
[2:36:48.400 --> 2:36:54.800]  show where i get into all of this and my only issue was
[2:36:54.800 --> 2:36:58.720]  i'm saying if we don't let this muslim mosque
[2:36:58.720 --> 2:37:02.240]  two blocks from ground zero have their free speech
[2:37:02.240 --> 2:37:06.160]  and have their right to religion that'll set the precedent that i don't have my
[2:37:06.160 --> 2:37:11.040]  right to free speech and religion okay and i pointed out that this particular
[2:37:11.040 --> 2:37:14.880]  sect is less than one percent and is new agey
[2:37:14.880 --> 2:37:19.040]  and most the other big muslim groups hate them and fight with them more than
[2:37:19.040 --> 2:37:22.560]  they fight with christians other people so that was my only point but let's say
[2:37:22.560 --> 2:37:27.040]  it was a hardcore wahhabiist mosque i don't like that i know 9-11 was an
[2:37:27.040 --> 2:37:29.680]  inside job used as a pretext to go into these
[2:37:29.680 --> 2:37:33.200]  countries for oil weapons sales israel and other issues
[2:37:33.200 --> 2:37:37.760]  it's just you have to be for the bill of rights and constitution for everybody
[2:37:37.760 --> 2:37:41.280]  or nobody's going to have it that's what i said
[2:37:41.280 --> 2:37:45.360]  that's what ron paul said uh and i do know
[2:37:45.360 --> 2:37:48.960]  that muslim pirates but they're also english pirates and
[2:37:48.960 --> 2:37:52.880]  you know uh french pirates and everybody else were robbing shipping
[2:37:52.880 --> 2:37:57.600]  of the infidels in the Mediterranean uh and in
[2:37:57.600 --> 2:38:02.800]  off the east coast of africa up into the persian gulf and i know full well about
[2:38:02.800 --> 2:38:06.560]  all those ships of leathernecks our marines will wear leather collars
[2:38:06.560 --> 2:38:09.840]  so you know it's armor so when the muslims would board their ships they
[2:38:09.840 --> 2:38:12.560]  couldn't chop their heads off right away that's the term leatherneck
[2:38:12.560 --> 2:38:16.640]  i know all about uh you know the big anti-war guy
[2:38:16.640 --> 2:38:23.200]  uh president uh sending uh the marines over there
[2:38:23.200 --> 2:38:27.680]  thomas jefferson and i'm fully aware of that uh so
[2:38:27.680 --> 2:38:32.720]  i mean i'm not i just don't want world war three with iran
[2:38:32.720 --> 2:38:36.080]  i just don't want world war three with pakistan they got nukes
[2:38:36.080 --> 2:38:39.680]  i mean do you agree we should have war with these people
[2:38:39.680 --> 2:38:44.480]  uh no i don't think that we should i don't think uh for a minute that we
[2:38:44.480 --> 2:38:48.000]  should seek to have some sort of war with them under
[2:38:48.000 --> 2:38:53.840]  false pretense okay now granted the the islamicists have been
[2:38:53.840 --> 2:38:57.280]  used and abused and a march has been created that the globalists believe
[2:38:57.280 --> 2:39:00.960]  they could control and and the one of the things that i appreciate
[2:39:00.960 --> 2:39:05.040]  about you most is bringing that fact out and flushing that out
[2:39:05.040 --> 2:39:08.800]  uh in in game and uh and i appreciate that to know it
[2:39:08.800 --> 2:39:12.000]  because that way that enables people to see
[2:39:12.000 --> 2:39:15.520]  our government in the light of who they are and enables them well it's not even
[2:39:15.520 --> 2:39:18.960]  our government it's a global corporate consortium that call themselves the new
[2:39:18.960 --> 2:39:21.920]  world order that have taken over all these governments
[2:39:21.920 --> 2:39:24.960]  here's what i'm saying i know there's been radical elements of islam from
[2:39:24.960 --> 2:39:28.160]  its beginning i know that they started the invasion
[2:39:28.160 --> 2:39:32.400]  uh and pushed all the way into western europe and tried to take over that's
[2:39:32.400 --> 2:39:36.240]  what groups do the romans were doing that you know under a christian banner and
[2:39:36.240 --> 2:39:40.880]  then they fell uh to the pagan visigoths and vandals
[2:39:40.880 --> 2:39:48.960]  and others my point here uh is that in the 40s and 50s and 60s on record our
[2:39:48.960 --> 2:39:51.920]  government would go in and fund radical
[2:39:51.920 --> 2:39:55.680]  muslims who overthrew the quasi secular governments
[2:39:55.680 --> 2:39:59.520]  that wanted to have first world countries they put radical muslims in
[2:39:59.520 --> 2:40:05.040]  to destabilize and to keep people you know the women barefoot and pregnant
[2:40:05.040 --> 2:40:08.800]  our system did not want them to become westernized
[2:40:08.800 --> 2:40:13.120]  and so that's a fact so so yes there are radical muslims that are dangerous out
[2:40:13.120 --> 2:40:16.960]  there my issue is they were super charged by our
[2:40:16.960 --> 2:40:20.720]  government and that's on record and and look look
[2:40:20.720 --> 2:40:24.800]  there aren't 30 million muslims in this country and i don't see them running
[2:40:24.800 --> 2:40:28.480]  around calling for jihad revolution i could care less
[2:40:28.480 --> 2:40:31.520]  if somebody's black white whatever color they are
[2:40:31.520 --> 2:40:35.040]  as long as they're for private property the bill of rights the constitution so i
[2:40:35.040 --> 2:40:38.080]  defend that so i have to say that you know we can't
[2:40:38.080 --> 2:40:41.040]  tell them they can't have this mosque because that i may not like it because
[2:40:41.040 --> 2:40:45.360]  i know how it's being spun but at the same time i can't
[2:40:45.360 --> 2:40:48.880]  say don't give them their rights or nobody will here's another issue
[2:40:48.880 --> 2:40:52.240]  if there were 30 million muslims here saying this
[2:40:52.240 --> 2:40:57.040]  you know belong to muslims saying go home to europe westerners
[2:40:57.040 --> 2:41:00.640]  uh pulling down american flags and running up
[2:41:00.640 --> 2:41:04.720]  uh you know turkish flags or iranian flags at schools
[2:41:04.720 --> 2:41:08.480]  and police stations and post offices and if muslims were in schools
[2:41:08.480 --> 2:41:11.920]  in san francisco saying you can't wear your american flag
[2:41:11.920 --> 2:41:15.760]  uh get out of here i would really be after them
[2:41:15.760 --> 2:41:20.080]  okay because here's the deal the forge foundation the bill of ellen gates
[2:41:20.080 --> 2:41:23.440]  foundation are on record billions of dollars together
[2:41:23.440 --> 2:41:28.160]  funding mexicans from mexico and it's perfect it's covert it's a different
[2:41:28.160 --> 2:41:31.200]  language uh you know americans that are americans don't
[2:41:31.200 --> 2:41:34.400]  know this is going on and it's being funded to break the country up for the
[2:41:34.400 --> 2:41:38.400]  north american union because it's real it's happening it's a foreign
[2:41:38.400 --> 2:41:42.000]  invasion of nationalistic fervor against the country
[2:41:42.000 --> 2:41:45.600]  and if i really start seeing muslims do that i'm gonna come out against them
[2:41:45.600 --> 2:41:50.560]  but i don't see that i see this this made up thing about a mosque
[2:41:50.560 --> 2:41:54.720]  and and and so i am an american not that our system's perfect was better than
[2:41:54.720 --> 2:41:58.720]  better than saudi arabia better than mexico better than communist china
[2:41:58.720 --> 2:42:03.120]  so i'm against china not because uh they're asian
[2:42:03.120 --> 2:42:06.640]  but because they've got a horrible corrupt system of dehumanization
[2:42:06.640 --> 2:42:10.000]  i'm against mexico not because they're mexican i'd love to see them free
[2:42:10.000 --> 2:42:12.560]  there'd be a paradise down there i'd probably have a house down there probably
[2:42:12.560 --> 2:42:15.760]  moved down there it's beautiful if it was like the united states but the
[2:42:15.760 --> 2:42:19.760]  culture isn't that way and it and it's lost wars with the u.s and
[2:42:19.760 --> 2:42:23.120]  they're taught in school down with america and i'm going to talk about it
[2:42:23.120 --> 2:42:26.800]  you know one week after nine eleven in mexico city the american team was
[2:42:26.800 --> 2:42:30.000]  playing the mexican team and they were chanting osama osama down with america
[2:42:30.000 --> 2:42:34.320]  i mean we got a problem folks you know i mean i'm not going to sit here and put
[2:42:34.320 --> 2:42:36.880]  up with people that say they're going to take my country over and they hate my
[2:42:36.880 --> 2:42:40.640]  gods and that's not saying hispanics are like that it's not saying all mexicans
[2:42:40.640 --> 2:42:43.920]  are like that mexicans are great patriotic americans if they choose to be
[2:42:43.920 --> 2:42:47.440]  american which most of them do but these illegals don't
[2:42:47.440 --> 2:42:50.880]  and so you know again that's not a religious or
[2:42:50.880 --> 2:42:54.960]  racial issue uh you know i mean if we had
[2:42:54.960 --> 2:42:58.800]  poland bordering us and poland had lost wars with us
[2:42:58.800 --> 2:43:03.280]  and part of this country been poland at a time and poland wasn't a free country
[2:43:03.280 --> 2:43:06.080]  and poland was saying this country belonged to them and there were 30
[2:43:06.080 --> 2:43:10.160]  million poles here i'd be against it not because they're white but because
[2:43:10.160 --> 2:43:14.160]  this isn't their country and this country is better
[2:43:14.160 --> 2:43:17.920]  i don't know how to explain it i mean i mean do you understand what i'm trying to get out here
[2:43:17.920 --> 2:43:20.160]  yeah i told me understand what you're trying to get up but see that's not
[2:43:20.160 --> 2:43:23.280]  their purpose their stated purpose is world domination this is what their
[2:43:23.280 --> 2:43:26.240]  book tells them to let me tell you something somebody
[2:43:26.240 --> 2:43:30.160]  comes to my door and tries to demand that i convert to islam
[2:43:30.160 --> 2:43:32.960]  or any or somebody comes to my door and tries to make my kids take mercury
[2:43:32.960 --> 2:43:36.880]  filled shots or somebody comes to my door and tries to draft my children
[2:43:36.880 --> 2:43:40.880]  i'm not anybody's slave okay so i'm not seeing
[2:43:40.880 --> 2:43:45.600]  what you are saying about uh muslims in this country they tend to be
[2:43:45.600 --> 2:43:48.320]  conservative they tend to be pro-second amendment
[2:43:48.320 --> 2:43:52.320]  i don't agree with some muslim groups trying to say you can't depict obama
[2:43:52.320 --> 2:43:56.160]  uh excuse me mohammad in a bad way another muslim excuse me
[2:43:56.160 --> 2:44:02.720]  uh and and so i'm being sarcastic folks uh so i'm against that okay i'm against
[2:44:02.720 --> 2:44:05.840]  them not letting them have their mosque and i'm against muslims trying to tell
[2:44:05.840 --> 2:44:08.480]  us what we can do in this country if they don't like it they should get out of
[2:44:08.480 --> 2:44:12.880]  here okay but i mean i don't know anything else sir you you've got the
[2:44:12.880 --> 2:44:16.000]  last minute thank you the point of the matter is
[2:44:16.000 --> 2:44:19.680]  the nature of who they say they are is not a religion
[2:44:19.680 --> 2:44:23.120]  and it is not just a a legal system it is a
[2:44:23.120 --> 2:44:28.320]  it is a quality or quantity of both and the thing about it is they're ruled by
[2:44:28.320 --> 2:44:31.920]  their religion that's their law so when you talk about their religion you talk
[2:44:31.920 --> 2:44:35.520]  about their political system as well you talk about if they start trying to
[2:44:35.520 --> 2:44:39.440]  implement sharia law within our state constitutions
[2:44:39.440 --> 2:44:44.320]  as soon as i see that i see the big foundations against the muslims
[2:44:44.320 --> 2:44:47.520]  okay as soon as if i ever see that i'm going to come out of the gates like a
[2:44:47.520 --> 2:44:49.920]  tiger well then you need to come out of the gates
[2:44:49.920 --> 2:44:53.200]  like a tiger because last week we were declared to be a compliant
[2:44:53.200 --> 2:44:56.880]  by some muslim cleric somewhere you need to come out of the gate now
[2:44:56.880 --> 2:45:00.640]  okay on that now i'm not saying alexa i was calling
[2:45:00.640 --> 2:45:03.120]  critical i mean a muslim cleric could do i mean
[2:45:03.120 --> 2:45:06.640]  somewhere there's probably a hundred doubt or more clerics could
[2:45:06.640 --> 2:45:10.240]  could declare the moons made of cheese that doesn't mean that's the way it is
[2:45:10.240 --> 2:45:12.960]  right well you know that's anyway i won't get into that but that's not the
[2:45:12.960 --> 2:45:17.840]  point the moon is made of cheese no no no no no the moon's not made of cheese
[2:45:17.840 --> 2:45:21.600]  least as far as i know nobody's sarcastic yeah me too
[2:45:21.600 --> 2:45:26.080]  anyway uh the key about this is is that this is their nature
[2:45:26.080 --> 2:45:29.680]  this is who they say they are this is what they say their goal i know you've
[2:45:29.680 --> 2:45:33.120]  told us that three times my my issue is this
[2:45:33.120 --> 2:45:37.360]  i'm against the open borders no more immigration legally legal for at least a
[2:45:37.360 --> 2:45:40.400]  decade because the globalist have brought all these groups in
[2:45:40.400 --> 2:45:43.760]  to get us all fighting with each other we're on our knees we're going into
[2:45:43.760 --> 2:45:48.080]  bankruptcy a depression we're falling apart the globalist at our master is
[2:45:48.080 --> 2:45:51.440]  at playing groups off against each other and so we can't have
[2:45:51.440 --> 2:45:56.160]  any of these foreign groups here uh anymore uh and at any higher levels
[2:45:56.160 --> 2:46:00.720]  because it's a globalist plan to break this country down
[2:46:00.720 --> 2:46:05.280]  if we didn't have multiculturalist who want to destroy the main culture of
[2:46:05.280 --> 2:46:08.000]  liberty and freedom and christianity in this country
[2:46:08.000 --> 2:46:12.000]  these other groups being here wouldn't be a problem uh so so
[2:46:12.000 --> 2:46:16.400]  we're in agreement uh that that there's a problem in this country
[2:46:16.400 --> 2:46:20.800]  across the board okay and so i oppose the globalist plan
[2:46:20.800 --> 2:46:24.160]  they want to attack these muslim countries i'm against it they make up
[2:46:24.160 --> 2:46:28.000]  wmds i'm against it they want to bring this stuff
[2:46:28.000 --> 2:46:32.880]  in and post the languages and make us adopt it i'm against it go ahead
[2:46:32.880 --> 2:46:36.800]  now the key to it is though um i i agree with you a hundred percent on those
[2:46:36.800 --> 2:46:40.880]  things and as far as uh them coming to your door
[2:46:40.880 --> 2:46:44.560]  telling you you got to do this do that that's what their goal is now i never
[2:46:44.560 --> 2:46:47.760]  said they would yeah well you know what i got the second amendment and things
[2:46:47.760 --> 2:46:50.640]  are going to get real rough if somebody tries that
[2:46:50.640 --> 2:46:56.480]  exactly so but the key to it is is that by the nature of if i tell you
[2:46:56.480 --> 2:47:00.080]  that that that i'm a bushwacker what do you expect you expect me to come hit
[2:47:00.080 --> 2:47:03.600]  you upside down take you which take what you got if i tell you that's who i am
[2:47:03.600 --> 2:47:06.800]  now we're either going to believe that's who they say they are or we're not and
[2:47:06.800 --> 2:47:10.960]  every time that we have not believed that some if if i walk up to you say i'm
[2:47:10.960 --> 2:47:13.840]  going to hit you upside your head and then i'll walk up to you and do it
[2:47:13.840 --> 2:47:17.120]  whose fault was it that i did it it's yours because i told you i was going to
[2:47:17.120 --> 2:47:21.040]  do what you didn't believe all right i appreciate your call i got to give the
[2:47:21.040 --> 2:47:25.280]  other caller some time we just spent basically 15 20 minutes on that subject
[2:47:25.280 --> 2:47:29.120]  you know gave me a headache uh let's talk to uh
[2:47:29.120 --> 2:47:33.920]  the point is i just want to cover news and then have you make your decision
[2:47:33.920 --> 2:47:36.720]  about legislation we cover and news we cover
[2:47:36.720 --> 2:47:41.760]  and world events you know i cover the information i give you my take on it
[2:47:41.760 --> 2:47:48.560]  and basically every culture is wicked you know i'm against things israel's
[2:47:48.560 --> 2:47:50.640]  doing i criticize it all the time but i don't hate
[2:47:50.640 --> 2:47:54.640]  jews or hate israel so i get attacked from both sides the pro israel crowd
[2:47:54.640 --> 2:47:58.480]  the anti-israel crowd you know i i'm not a muslim
[2:47:58.480 --> 2:48:05.120]  and it's not my faith uh and so i get bashed for not being pro islam but i get
[2:48:05.120 --> 2:48:09.200]  bashed for not being anti i mean i'm just here to cover the information
[2:48:09.200 --> 2:48:12.720]  okay i'm just here to cover what's happening in the world
[2:48:12.720 --> 2:48:18.320]  the poison in our food and water the big global force is the scientific eugenicist
[2:48:18.320 --> 2:48:22.720]  and i you know after we defeat them if we want to kill each other we can do that
[2:48:22.720 --> 2:48:27.120]  okay i'm i'm dealing with the folks that want to give me a vaccine
[2:48:27.120 --> 2:48:32.720]  to literally brain damage me so i submit to them this is all on record
[2:48:32.720 --> 2:48:36.480]  that's the big issue that's the big threat okay i'm i'm saying do
[2:48:36.480 --> 2:48:41.280]  do we want this as a society jonathan in texas you're on the air
[2:48:41.280 --> 2:48:45.360]  what is going on alex worldwide broadcast what's on your mind
[2:48:45.360 --> 2:48:50.400]  what's on my mind um let's see here i got a lot a lot of a lot of things to talk
[2:48:50.400 --> 2:48:53.440]  about um well god because time is short go ahead
[2:48:53.440 --> 2:48:57.040]  yeah absolutely uh tell you the truth uh i'm gonna do this
[2:48:57.040 --> 2:49:01.520]  uh with imagery and what not of what the elite know
[2:49:01.520 --> 2:49:05.040]  and how they know it and why
[2:49:05.040 --> 2:49:08.240]  if you're if you're gonna lay it on us brother we're ready to go or i'll get
[2:49:08.240 --> 2:49:13.200]  any younger here all right draw a circle
[2:49:13.200 --> 2:49:17.120]  okay go ahead what what do you see when you see that circle
[2:49:17.120 --> 2:49:20.880]  give me a document cam guys okay i see a round sphere that contains what's
[2:49:20.880 --> 2:49:25.040]  within and keeps out what is without
[2:49:25.040 --> 2:49:30.800]  and also is whatever whatever you look at as well the wheels on the car light
[2:49:30.800 --> 2:49:35.440]  bulbs the earth itself
[2:49:36.320 --> 2:49:42.560]  yes you know i'm saying that that symbolism symbol symbolizes creation
[2:49:42.560 --> 2:49:48.960]  itself okay then if you if you go to uh
[2:49:48.960 --> 2:49:56.480]  jahu or whatnot and uh look at uh lady gaga's uh
[2:49:56.480 --> 2:50:01.440]  how is it yeah there's lots of illuminati symbolism everywhere but they take
[2:50:01.440 --> 2:50:05.920]  powerful symbols and they expropriate them and use them for their own aims
[2:50:05.920 --> 2:50:09.520]  and then people get over obsessed over symbols and then think
[2:50:09.520 --> 2:50:13.200]  you know other things uh but certainly that's uh
[2:50:13.200 --> 2:50:17.040]  certainly that's going on let me ask you a question did you just smoke a large

[2:55:58.800 --> 2:56:03.120]  uh... i just wanted to talk to you about um... nine eleven and
[2:56:03.120 --> 2:56:06.240]  um... why Obama doesn't want to investigate it
[2:56:06.240 --> 2:56:10.640]  well that's because it was a government operation but sure go ahead
[2:56:10.640 --> 2:56:15.360]  well just weird because uh... it all happened while Bush was president and
[2:56:15.360 --> 2:56:19.680]  then you think obama being an opposing political no they weren't for the very
[2:56:19.680 --> 2:56:22.480]  same power structure they always protect the last crook
[2:56:22.480 --> 2:56:26.000]  so when he leaves office he'll be protected
[2:56:26.000 --> 2:56:29.680]  i know exactly so i was supporting obama and then
[2:56:29.680 --> 2:56:32.880]  i find out that he's not even interested in
[2:56:32.880 --> 2:56:36.960]  uh... exposing the truth of my living he got four times the money mccain got
[2:56:36.960 --> 2:56:40.400]  from wall street not that mccain was good but they were gonna put
[2:56:40.400 --> 2:56:43.440]  obama in of course obama's bad but i'm glad you're
[2:56:43.440 --> 2:56:45.600]  waking up to that
[2:56:45.600 --> 2:56:48.560]  yeah so that's the thing that's like he's just another
[2:56:48.560 --> 2:56:52.560]  he's just another republican candidate pretending to be a democrat so there's
[2:56:52.560 --> 2:56:55.280]  like not even two political parties you know
[2:56:55.280 --> 2:56:59.200]  well how's the whose song go meet the new boss same as the old boss won't get
[2:56:59.200 --> 2:57:01.600]  fooled again
[2:57:01.600 --> 2:57:04.880]  yeah and i was just like i've been watching it's kind of been
[2:57:04.880 --> 2:57:07.760]  kind of old news but i was watching youtube and everything
[2:57:07.760 --> 2:57:12.080]  and like you know you see all the the three towers just falling to the ground
[2:57:12.080 --> 2:57:16.320]  like like a house of cars you know we got the police saying get back they're
[2:57:16.320 --> 2:57:19.040]  gonna blow up building seven and then saying they didn't say it and now it's
[2:57:19.040 --> 2:57:21.440]  admitted they blew it up i appreciate your call
[2:57:21.440 --> 2:57:24.160]  zack trying to get as many calls in as possible
[2:57:24.160 --> 2:57:28.080]  last caller i meant to go to yarrow and mark don't have time mike in colorado
[2:57:28.080 --> 2:57:32.480]  you're on the air go ahead mike alex brother alex brother it's
[2:57:32.480 --> 2:57:35.440]  pleasure to speak to you again it's been about eight years
[2:57:35.440 --> 2:57:39.200]  hey uh... i wanted to ask you one quick question
[2:57:39.200 --> 2:57:42.720]  yes i want to know if you know who this kevin trudeau is
[2:57:42.720 --> 2:57:46.000]  you know who i'm talking about yes yes i've had him on the show before
[2:57:46.000 --> 2:57:51.120]  yes okay and he's a good guy yeah he seems pretty good i mean i don't i
[2:57:51.120 --> 2:57:54.720]  hadn't read all of his writings and uh... you know there's some stuff i don't
[2:57:54.720 --> 2:57:58.000]  particularly agree with but i agree with his first amendment right
[2:57:58.000 --> 2:58:01.760]  uh... to not be persecuted and and uh... you know to be able to
[2:58:01.760 --> 2:58:06.400]  have a say absolutely i i just wondered because you know it's one thing to
[2:58:06.400 --> 2:58:09.600]  read something that somebody's written it's another thing to actually hear them
[2:58:09.600 --> 2:58:13.440]  speak and hear the you know the tone of the voice and the truth and
[2:58:13.440 --> 2:58:17.440]  you know no i think a lot of what he's done especially with uh... you know the
[2:58:17.440 --> 2:58:20.960]  herbs and things i've researched myself looks pretty accurate to me
[2:58:20.960 --> 2:58:24.320]  and he has the feds always after him and if they can shut down his free speech
[2:58:24.320 --> 2:58:27.040]  they can shut down my free speech and they can shut down the mosque
[2:58:27.040 --> 2:58:30.160]  they can shut down freedom of religion and private property so we want to get
[2:58:30.160 --> 2:58:33.200]  rid of that i mean that's the bigger question
[2:58:33.200 --> 2:58:36.400]  folks we had ron paul on the start of the transmission it's coming up the next
[2:58:36.400 --> 2:58:39.280]  hour info wars dot com great job crew
