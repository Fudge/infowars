[00:00.000 --> 00:28.440]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop
[00:28.440 --> 00:39.000]  tyranny well so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones
[00:39.000 --> 00:52.440]  here we are the shortest day of the year Tuesday December 21st the year is
[00:52.440 --> 01:05.640]  2021 21 21 what a day what a time to be alive what a new year that we were
[01:05.640 --> 01:11.680]  about to be plunged into thank you so much for joining us here today I
[01:11.680 --> 01:16.320]  apologize to the crew and the listeners yesterday that I was legitimately
[01:16.320 --> 01:22.160]  having breakdowns on here because I'm a real person and I need to learn self
[01:22.160 --> 01:27.080]  control I've gotten better about it over the years but I am so upset with
[01:27.080 --> 01:34.000]  Trump and the betrayal that it just it just makes the top of my head blow off
[01:34.000 --> 01:38.640]  I get so angry fact just thinking about it right now I'm getting pissed in the
[01:38.640 --> 01:46.040]  gut you know what I mean a sick burning feeling of disgust I don't go back to
[01:46.040 --> 01:54.680]  that feeling again just sort of happening again because you see I get in
[01:54.680 --> 01:59.400]  here for hours before the show and I scan over hundreds of articles I read
[01:59.400 --> 02:03.800]  dozens of articles I watch dozens of video clips I take phone calls I read
[02:03.800 --> 02:09.760]  government documents I read pieces of legislation I read lawsuits and I'm
[02:09.760 --> 02:14.840]  sitting here looking at the British Medical Journal saying there's no doubt
[02:14.840 --> 02:20.640]  the Pfizer and Moderna shots as well as the J&J in AstraZeneca all cause massive
[02:20.640 --> 02:26.320]  increases in heart attacks and microcarditis as well as arrhythmias I
[02:27.080 --> 02:32.680]  know people personally took it and got serious heart problems from it personally
[02:32.680 --> 02:37.880]  and then I sit there and I see Trump sit up there and laugh and say it works
[02:37.880 --> 02:41.880]  great it's wonderful everybody should get it and all the rest that crap it
[02:41.880 --> 02:47.440]  makes me physically ill but I'm gonna move on from Trump that's why I got so
[02:47.440 --> 02:50.680]  upset yesterday because we've invested so much in Trump and he has so much
[02:50.680 --> 02:54.240]  promise and he could really be a champion and the leader we need of
[02:54.240 --> 02:58.320]  whatever reason he's decided to hang around with that loser Bill O'Reilly and
[02:58.320 --> 03:02.360]  when you lay down with dogs you get fleas I'm done talking about it I'm gonna
[03:02.360 --> 03:11.360]  move on but speaking of the COVID news every day we're on air is a blessing
[03:11.360 --> 03:14.800]  is they're trying to take us off air they're trying to shut you up trying to
[03:14.800 --> 03:20.960]  shut us all up they're closing the door on freedom every day I'm on air it gets
[03:20.960 --> 03:28.000]  worse I mean I've got in my stack mainstream news going yeah yeah about
[03:28.000 --> 03:31.120]  one out of a hundred people took the Pfizer shot had a heart attack and a
[03:31.120 --> 03:38.120]  bunch of them died one out of a hundred good Lord that's I've got the Lansing
[03:38.120 --> 03:43.240]  Journal the British Medical Journal right here I'm gonna show it to you and
[03:43.240 --> 03:50.800]  this nightmare doesn't end that's one article one article in this stack right
[03:50.800 --> 03:58.600]  here so I'm gonna do my best to be to not flip out today and just try to
[03:58.600 --> 04:04.120]  calmly read you these stories and go over these because you know it's one
[04:04.120 --> 04:07.720]  thing of adults want to be cowardly and go get shots and have our detection die
[04:07.720 --> 04:11.560]  at a certain point I'm kind of a sick level glad the Democrats are all
[04:11.560 --> 04:14.560]  killing themselves but you know a lot of them mean well as well and so I
[04:14.560 --> 04:18.080]  shouldn't have that evil thought I repent of it God but I'm being honest
[04:18.080 --> 04:21.280]  about that I have a lot of friends that are Democrats that mean well they're
[04:21.280 --> 04:25.600]  just like caught in its mind control and can't admit they're wrong and and I get
[04:25.600 --> 04:28.120]  it they look at Trump's problems and think well this must be the answer no
[04:28.120 --> 04:33.840]  what your side's much worse but I really want to just empathize there by and be
[04:33.840 --> 04:39.120]  Christlike because that's the spirit we need to not let this destroy us because
[04:39.120 --> 04:42.520]  we don't want to turn into who they are we want to be Christlike especially with
[04:42.520 --> 04:46.880]  Christmas here it's a few days away all right just wait till we come back in 60

[05:00.440 --> 05:07.480]  this could be in full wars last Christmas because it could be America's
[05:07.480 --> 05:12.000]  last Christmas evil is taking over the planet they're destroying our borders

[07:18.640 --> 07:19.640]  All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[07:19.640 --> 07:22.800]  thank you so much for joining us on this
[07:22.800 --> 07:27.800]  shortest day of the year,
[07:29.400 --> 07:32.440]  December 21st, 2021.
[07:36.160 --> 07:38.520]  All right, let me tell you what's coming up today
[07:38.520 --> 07:40.040]  and then we're gonna hit it all.
[07:41.040 --> 07:45.240]  Ali Alexander who went and testified for eight hours
[07:45.240 --> 07:50.240]  to the House January 6th Witch Hunt Committee
[07:50.240 --> 07:53.160]  will be in studio in the second hour.
[07:54.160 --> 07:58.160]  And within two days of the Gateway Pundit article
[07:59.160 --> 08:01.520]  with the reporter we had on Saturday,
[08:02.520 --> 08:05.760]  Jacob Ingalls breaking it on our show Saturday
[08:05.760 --> 08:08.960]  just again proud of us being at the Spir with the Gateway Pundit.
[08:08.960 --> 08:11.640]  Jan 6th member has business ties to China
[08:11.640 --> 08:14.440]  and the Chinese Communist Intelligence Agencies.
[08:14.440 --> 08:16.440]  She's announced that she's not running for Congress
[08:16.440 --> 08:18.880]  two days after this came out.
[08:18.880 --> 08:22.640]  This came out, we'll also be talking about that.
[08:22.640 --> 08:24.840]  So that's what you get to go in a room with.
[08:27.240 --> 08:29.800]  You literally get to see the enemies of America,
[08:31.360 --> 08:33.560]  daughters of famous war criminals, you name it,
[08:33.560 --> 08:36.240]  a true legion of evil.
[08:38.800 --> 08:39.800]  Not looking for the truth,
[08:39.800 --> 08:41.960]  but trying to set you up with perjury traps
[08:41.960 --> 08:43.240]  to send you to prison.
[08:43.240 --> 08:49.000]  That's coming up a second hour as well.
[08:51.480 --> 08:56.480]  And Ali went in and told him everything, the truth.
[08:56.720 --> 08:59.200]  He'd say, no, none of us planned any violence.
[08:59.200 --> 09:02.160]  We had a permit, we were there to be peaceful.
[09:02.160 --> 09:04.120]  And they'd say, so you admit here under oath
[09:04.120 --> 09:05.240]  that you launched attacks,
[09:05.240 --> 09:06.560]  that you were the commander of the attack.
[09:06.560 --> 09:07.640]  And he was like, what?
[09:10.520 --> 09:12.480]  Because there's no honor amongst these people.
[09:12.480 --> 09:15.920]  They're here executing the takedown of the country.
[09:15.920 --> 09:18.120]  They have zero honor.
[09:18.120 --> 09:19.720]  In fact, they have negative honor.
[09:21.320 --> 09:23.840]  And as soon as people get that through their heads,
[09:23.840 --> 09:25.680]  the sooner we start saving this country,
[09:25.680 --> 09:27.600]  of course they're destroying the currency.
[09:27.600 --> 09:29.320]  Of course they're destroying the military.
[09:29.320 --> 09:30.880]  Of course they're destroying the borders.
[09:30.880 --> 09:33.360]  Of course, a bunch of the producers at CNN
[09:33.360 --> 09:35.840]  don't just wanna have sex or do have sex
[09:35.840 --> 09:37.160]  with little boys and girls.
[09:37.160 --> 09:43.640]  They are recruiting them as sex ops for other men.
[09:47.000 --> 09:49.600]  Jeffrey Epstein was just one elf
[09:49.600 --> 09:55.120]  in the Satanic New World Order's workshop.
[09:55.120 --> 09:58.480]  These are criminals we're dealing with.
[09:58.480 --> 10:02.000]  These are people who are gone.
[10:02.000 --> 10:04.680]  You look at Elizabeth Warren's eyes.
[10:04.680 --> 10:07.240]  You look at Adam Schiff's eyes.
[10:07.240 --> 10:09.160]  They're gone, folks.
[10:09.160 --> 10:12.200]  Lights are on, but nobody's home.
[10:12.200 --> 10:14.600]  Like old Clint Black used to say.
[10:14.600 --> 10:18.280]  The lights are on, but nobody's home.
[10:23.360 --> 10:25.640]  We've got a case of real evil.
[10:25.640 --> 10:26.960]  Make it its move on us.
[10:27.920 --> 10:29.680]  And as we enter 2022,
[10:29.680 --> 10:32.640]  it's making its move against Info Wars
[10:32.640 --> 10:35.400]  because we are one of the final dominoes
[10:35.400 --> 10:37.120]  that hasn't fallen for them,
[10:37.120 --> 10:38.840]  that hasn't rolled over,
[10:38.840 --> 10:41.600]  like Trump's doing with the vaccines and the rest of it.
[10:42.960 --> 10:44.480]  And I will be faithful to the end.
[10:44.480 --> 10:46.520]  I'm not gonna back down.
[10:46.520 --> 10:48.080]  But I can tell you, ladies and gentlemen,
[10:48.080 --> 10:49.480]  we could give out.
[10:49.480 --> 10:50.560]  And that's why I'll just say right up here
[10:50.560 --> 10:52.200]  at the first of the broadcast,
[10:52.200 --> 10:54.880]  we have several million dollars of shortfalls
[10:54.880 --> 10:56.120]  to fund this operation.
[10:56.120 --> 10:58.080]  You know, you read about and you see stories
[10:58.080 --> 11:01.440]  about hundreds of leftist online publications
[11:01.440 --> 11:03.560]  that would have 30, 40, 50 employees
[11:03.560 --> 11:06.800]  with budgets of 20, 30, 40 million dollars going bankrupt
[11:06.800 --> 11:08.880]  because they can't make money.
[11:08.880 --> 11:11.520]  But that's what it cost, ladies and gentlemen,
[11:11.520 --> 11:13.480]  when you go out and you license the photos
[11:13.480 --> 11:15.360]  and license all the stuff and have the lawyers
[11:15.360 --> 11:18.040]  and have the crew have to pay for your own infrastructure,
[11:18.040 --> 11:20.960]  they don't have to pay for all that infrastructure we do
[11:20.960 --> 11:23.600]  and we do it for less money than they do.
[11:25.840 --> 11:29.240]  But we've got to sell 50 plus million dollars
[11:29.240 --> 11:34.720]  worth of merchandise every year to be able
[11:34.720 --> 11:36.600]  to then have enough money left over
[11:36.600 --> 11:39.600]  from the quote profit of that to feed it into the system.
[11:39.600 --> 11:42.360]  And you've made such massive investments in InfoWars
[11:42.360 --> 11:46.280]  in your time, your energy, your support, your prayers
[11:46.280 --> 11:50.160]  in the decades past that this is like a nine month
[11:50.160 --> 11:53.760]  due baby and the baby's gonna be born next week.
[11:55.040 --> 11:57.280]  And then you just decide to have an abortion.
[11:57.280 --> 12:00.880]  And I'm not guilting you, I'm saying to myself included
[12:00.880 --> 12:03.400]  because stuff's gotten rough publicly and privately.
[12:03.400 --> 12:04.800]  They're really making their move on me.
[12:04.800 --> 12:06.320]  You know, they've told me you're gonna stop
[12:06.320 --> 12:07.480]  or you're gonna go to prison.
[12:07.480 --> 12:09.320]  We'll set you up one way or another.
[12:09.320 --> 12:10.680]  Well, I mean, you're already killing kids.
[12:10.680 --> 12:12.120]  You're already destroying society.
[12:12.120 --> 12:16.400]  So am I gonna just run and hide so that many years from now
[12:16.400 --> 12:19.040]  I can be laying in my bed in a totally enslaved system
[12:19.040 --> 12:22.000]  wishing I'd have been a real man at the time of the challenge?
[12:22.000 --> 12:23.680]  No, I'm not backing down right now.
[12:23.680 --> 12:27.920]  One of my friends said, the works with us
[12:27.920 --> 12:30.760]  has been persecuted along with us, said in for a penny,
[12:30.760 --> 12:33.120]  in for a pound, ladies and gentlemen,
[12:33.120 --> 12:35.480]  you gotta have the dishonorable evil people over here?
[12:35.480 --> 12:37.200]  Well, that's not who we are.
[12:39.400 --> 12:41.200]  If anything, I fight too hard sometimes
[12:41.200 --> 12:42.520]  and get upset and get really angry
[12:42.520 --> 12:44.520]  and it's not a good thing for anybody,
[12:44.520 --> 12:45.720]  including my own health.
[12:47.160 --> 12:48.560]  So I am asking for your prayers.
[12:48.560 --> 12:50.080]  I am asking your financial support
[12:50.080 --> 12:51.600]  and I am asking for your word of mouth
[12:51.600 --> 12:53.720]  because you are the resistance
[12:53.720 --> 12:57.560]  and God always keeps it that way.
[12:57.560 --> 12:59.200]  We're always just bringing in enough money,
[12:59.200 --> 13:01.960]  just bringing in enough money, just bringing in enough money.
[13:01.960 --> 13:04.880]  And then now, every time we get back in the black,
[13:04.880 --> 13:07.120]  we're right back in the red
[13:07.120 --> 13:08.880]  and just going into this critical time
[13:08.880 --> 13:11.360]  when they've been so close to completely shutting us down
[13:11.360 --> 13:13.440]  and that's not even be able to take your orders
[13:13.440 --> 13:14.800]  and enforce where.com.
[13:14.800 --> 13:18.080]  Now is the time while you can, it's really on my heart,
[13:18.080 --> 13:19.800]  my intellect, but also my spirit,
[13:19.800 --> 13:21.880]  that we need to have a war chest.
[13:21.880 --> 13:24.600]  We need to have extra money, not just enough
[13:25.520 --> 13:28.120]  in the position of having to actually cut pay
[13:28.120 --> 13:31.480]  or lay people off when we need every person we've got here.
[13:32.480 --> 13:34.920]  There's a real sense of urgency in infowars,
[13:34.920 --> 13:36.760]  but there's a real sense of urgency everywhere.
[13:36.760 --> 13:38.000]  Either people are awake
[13:38.000 --> 13:40.760]  and know how much trouble society is in
[13:40.760 --> 13:44.280]  or they're more lackadaisical, more drowned entertainment,
[13:44.280 --> 13:47.360]  more living in fantasy land
[13:47.360 --> 13:51.240]  and under a great delusion that is now upon the world.
[13:52.440 --> 13:55.640]  So do your Christmas shopping at infowarsstore.com
[13:55.640 --> 13:58.160]  and get the supplements like vitamin mineral fusion.
[13:58.160 --> 13:59.920]  It's gonna sell out in a week,

[15:27.960 --> 15:29.280]  but it's a limited edition, we're not.
[15:29.280 --> 15:32.440]  It was 10,000 coins, because that took us
[15:32.440 --> 15:34.640]  from being three million behind,
[15:34.640 --> 15:35.600]  to being two million behind it.
[15:35.600 --> 15:37.120]  I'm not bitching, I'm just saying,
[15:37.120 --> 15:38.840]  we've gotta keep infowars on the air.
[15:38.840 --> 15:39.920]  We can't back down.
[15:39.920 --> 15:41.640]  We've got a bunch of projects that are almost done
[15:41.640 --> 15:42.560]  and almost complete.
[15:42.560 --> 15:44.600]  The baby is nine months.
[15:44.600 --> 15:48.240]  It's about to be born, next level, 110% next year.
[15:48.240 --> 15:49.720]  I wanna thank you all for your support.
[15:49.720 --> 15:50.880]  I wanna wish you a Merry Christmas.
[15:50.880 --> 15:53.080]  I wanna ask you to continue to invest in Infowars,
[15:53.080 --> 15:55.040]  the winning horse in the fight for liberty.
[15:55.040 --> 15:57.520]  InfowarsStore.com, go there now.
[16:01.440 --> 16:04.280]  This could be Infowars Last Christmas,
[16:04.280 --> 16:06.960]  because it could be America's Last Christmas.
[16:06.960 --> 16:09.080]  Evil is taking over the planet.
[16:09.080 --> 16:10.960]  They're destroying our borders, our sovereignty,
[16:10.960 --> 16:13.760]  our supply chains, our language, our currencies.
[16:13.760 --> 16:15.040]  They're coming after us.
[16:15.040 --> 16:17.760]  And if we don't support American businesses,
[16:17.760 --> 16:19.720]  and if we don't support independent media
[16:19.720 --> 16:21.600]  in the final days of 2021,
[16:21.600 --> 16:24.560]  we have no future in the midterms in 2022.
[16:24.560 --> 16:29.240]  2022 is the year where America decides its fate.
[16:29.240 --> 16:31.080]  I wanna thank you all for your support.
[16:31.080 --> 16:33.040]  I wanna encourage you to your Christmas shopping,

[16:58.960 --> 16:59.800]  Thank you.
[16:59.800 --> 17:02.800]  Christmas Day 2021 is almost here.

[17:06.400 --> 17:08.480]  who have changed the world through your support
[17:08.480 --> 17:12.160]  of Infowars to help take this fight against tyranny

[17:14.680 --> 17:18.520]  We've extended the sale of 25% off on the course,
[17:18.520 --> 17:20.040]  Mind Wars, Spirit Wars.

[17:27.200 --> 17:29.520]  your neighbors the gift of being aware
[17:29.520 --> 17:31.640]  of how the globalists are manipulating them
[17:31.640 --> 17:33.200]  and trying to break their will.
[17:33.200 --> 17:36.520]  And please give yourself and the whole world the gift
[17:36.520 --> 17:39.720]  of keeping Infowars on the air at this critical time.
[17:39.720 --> 17:42.080]  Without your support, we would have already been shut down.
[17:42.080 --> 17:44.280]  With your support, we're not just gonna stay on air.
[17:44.280 --> 17:46.120]  We're gonna take the fight to the next level
[17:46.120 --> 17:49.120]  because now is the historic point.
[17:49.120 --> 17:52.440]  Now is the inflection point, and it's all about Reset Wars.
[17:52.440 --> 17:55.840]  25% off through Christmas Day at ResetWars.com.
[17:55.840 --> 17:57.040]  Get the course now.
[17:59.680 --> 18:00.960]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[18:00.960 --> 18:03.000]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[18:03.000 --> 18:03.840]  Welcome.
[18:03.840 --> 18:04.680]  Hello, Alex.
[18:04.680 --> 18:05.520]  Yes, Malcolm.
[18:05.520 --> 18:07.160]  It's quick and real short
[18:07.160 --> 18:09.160]  where the other Patriots can get on the line.
[18:09.160 --> 18:11.240]  Alex, I have to promote one thing
[18:11.240 --> 18:13.560]  from one of your co-hosts, Owen Shroyer.
[18:13.560 --> 18:16.560]  Supermell Vitality and Brain Force Plus.
[18:16.560 --> 18:19.440]  Mix those two together, you're an unstoppable tank.
[18:19.440 --> 18:21.280]  Supermell Vitality really, really works.
[18:21.280 --> 18:24.520]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds
[18:24.520 --> 18:26.120]  that have never been heated up.
[18:26.120 --> 18:30.720]  And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions.
[18:30.720 --> 18:33.000]  It also worked quite well, but just aren't as strong.
[18:33.000 --> 18:34.760]  This is like a very fine wine.
[18:34.760 --> 18:36.880]  In fact, each batch is different.
[18:36.880 --> 18:39.360]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[18:39.360 --> 18:40.720]  People are like, why are you selling something
[18:40.720 --> 18:42.640]  and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong?
[18:42.640 --> 18:43.560]  That's just how it is.
[18:43.560 --> 18:45.120]  It's how it works.
[18:45.120 --> 18:46.840]  So it's always good.
[18:46.840 --> 18:48.960]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[18:48.960 --> 18:52.000]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price,
[18:52.000 --> 18:53.000]  then this is it.
[18:53.000 --> 18:57.960]  Cobra Commander here, with an important message to humanity.
[18:57.960 --> 19:03.160]  I have decided that all of you will take a special injection
[19:03.160 --> 19:05.160]  so that you will be safe.
[19:05.160 --> 19:08.920]  But the injection is not ready yet.
[19:08.920 --> 19:13.760]  And so I need all of you to stay indoors
[19:13.760 --> 19:15.760]  for the next 15 minutes.
[19:15.760 --> 19:20.760]  And so I need all of you to stay indoors
[19:20.760 --> 19:25.760]  for the next 15 days to flatten the cans.
[19:25.760 --> 19:27.760]  I also need you to wear masks,
[19:27.760 --> 19:33.760]  and I also need you to only shop at mega corporations.
[19:33.760 --> 19:36.760]  That way we can consolidate control
[19:36.760 --> 19:39.760]  and bankrupt the world economy,
[19:39.760 --> 19:43.760]  leaving companies that only I own profitable.
[19:43.760 --> 19:46.760]  You will then be my slaves.
[19:46.760 --> 19:51.760]  Oh, and then you'll get that special shot of freedom from Cobra.
[19:51.760 --> 19:53.760]  It will remove your immune system,
[19:53.760 --> 20:19.760]  so you'll be dependent on me for the rest of your miserable lives.
[20:24.760 --> 20:27.760]  All right, this is what I'm going to do.
[20:27.760 --> 20:32.760]  Next segment I'm going to hit the most out of control world government,
[20:32.760 --> 20:36.760]  forced microchipping, forced injections to buy and sell,
[20:36.760 --> 20:39.760]  planetary UN dictatorship news.
[20:39.760 --> 20:43.760]  That is this stack right here.
[20:43.760 --> 20:46.760]  And some good news, things like the Japanese government tells citizens
[20:46.760 --> 20:48.760]  don't discriminate against the unvaccinated.
[20:48.760 --> 20:50.760]  What a world we live in.
[20:50.760 --> 20:54.760]  Almost none of the Japanese are dumb enough to take the shots.
[20:54.760 --> 20:56.760]  They know what's going on.
[20:56.760 --> 20:58.760]  But let's hit this first.
[20:58.760 --> 21:02.760]  This is what's really important to understand where we're going.
[21:02.760 --> 21:06.760]  Without even looking last night and this morning,
[21:06.760 --> 21:11.760]  I ran across more than 10 op-ed articles
[21:11.760 --> 21:14.760]  being promoted all over the internet,
[21:14.760 --> 21:17.760]  from Yahoo News to Twitter to Instagram.
[21:17.760 --> 21:20.760]  The Boston Globe, you name it,
[21:20.760 --> 21:26.760]  calling for an end to the First Amendment and the Second Amendment.
[21:26.760 --> 21:29.760]  Now, you dovetail that with the Pentagon's new guidelines saying
[21:29.760 --> 21:32.760]  that if you like something they call extremist,
[21:32.760 --> 21:37.760]  including the OK sign or the Gadsden flag,
[21:37.760 --> 21:40.760]  which they just took out of the military a few years ago,
[21:40.760 --> 21:44.760]  it's the first U.S. flag even before Betsy Ross
[21:44.760 --> 21:50.760]  made the first American flag.
[21:50.760 --> 21:53.760]  And then, oh, just a few years later, oh, guess what?
[21:53.760 --> 21:57.760]  Will court-martial you if you click on something?
[21:57.760 --> 22:01.760]  Oh, and the ADL runs computer programs,
[22:01.760 --> 22:04.760]  watching everyone on Twitter and Facebook
[22:04.760 --> 22:10.760]  and tracking who they are and now has databases to report on our military.
[22:10.760 --> 22:12.760]  I mean, this is the secret police.
[22:12.760 --> 22:13.760]  This is a criminal takeover.
[22:13.760 --> 22:18.760]  That's in the news right here.
[22:18.760 --> 22:19.760]  In fact, I went to cover that yesterday.
[22:19.760 --> 22:21.760]  I had it in my stack.
[22:21.760 --> 22:22.760]  Hey, John, you're the one that gave it to me.
[22:22.760 --> 22:24.760]  We give it to them again as they put it on the screen.
[22:24.760 --> 22:26.760]  The ADL Braden, you know, the ADL's Twitter account,
[22:26.760 --> 22:28.760]  they show how they track everybody.
[22:28.760 --> 22:30.760]  What you're doing, where you're visiting,
[22:30.760 --> 22:32.760]  what you're reading, they're watching you,
[22:32.760 --> 22:36.760]  because they're the good guys.
[22:36.760 --> 22:46.760]  So this is an article out of the Tampa newspaper.
[22:46.760 --> 22:51.760]  Law professor rewrites the First and Second Amendment,
[22:51.760 --> 22:55.760]  which doesn't include freedom of the press or the right to bear arms.
[22:55.760 --> 22:59.760]  This is Kindle Tights writing this.
[22:59.760 --> 23:02.760]  A law professor argued in Boston Globe op-ed
[23:02.760 --> 23:04.760]  that the First and Second Amendment should be rewritten
[23:04.760 --> 23:06.760]  to change how it defines the freedom of the press
[23:06.760 --> 23:07.760]  and the right to bear arms.
[23:07.760 --> 23:09.760]  And of course, could you guess,
[23:09.760 --> 23:11.760]  it isn't keeping the rights or expanding them.
[23:11.760 --> 23:12.760]  It's getting rid of them.
[23:12.760 --> 23:14.760]  Mary Ann Franks.
[23:14.760 --> 23:17.760]  Oh, Ann Frank.
[23:17.760 --> 23:18.760]  I wonder why Mary.
[23:18.760 --> 23:20.760]  I wonder if Ann Franks is named after Ann Frank.
[23:20.760 --> 23:22.760]  Ann Frank got killed by an authoritarian government.
[23:22.760 --> 23:28.760]  Mary Ann Franks, a professor at University of Miami School of Law
[23:28.760 --> 23:32.760]  and author of The Cult of the Constitution.
[23:32.760 --> 23:36.760]  Are deadly devotion to guns and free speech.
[23:36.760 --> 23:37.760]  That's a real book.
[23:37.760 --> 23:39.760]  That's a real headline.
[23:39.760 --> 23:41.760]  So, you know, the Nazis weren't for free speech
[23:41.760 --> 23:43.760]  or the citizens owning guns either.
[23:43.760 --> 23:49.760]  So, I mean, will Mary Ann Franks seek out a time machine
[23:49.760 --> 23:55.760]  to teleport herself back 80 years to the height of the Nazi era?
[23:55.760 --> 23:59.760]  Mary Ann Franks, a professor at the University of Miami School of Law
[23:59.760 --> 24:03.760]  and the author of, quote, The Cult of the Constitution.
[24:03.760 --> 24:06.760]  Well, the left's the cult of pedophiles and bankruptcy and feces
[24:06.760 --> 24:08.760]  and heroin needles.
[24:08.760 --> 24:13.760]  The cult of the Constitution are deadly devotion to guns and free speech.
[24:13.760 --> 24:16.760]  Wrote an op-ed in the Boston Globe arguing that the Constitution
[24:16.760 --> 24:21.760]  has competing interpretations that inspire religious like fervor
[24:21.760 --> 24:24.760]  leading to irrational results.
[24:24.760 --> 24:29.760]  So, you want to fire the police, have your own private security
[24:29.760 --> 24:34.760]  if you're a professor or a city council person.
[24:34.760 --> 24:36.760]  That's how it works all over the country.
[24:36.760 --> 24:39.760]  And then I can't have a gun in my house or my business to protect myself.
[24:39.760 --> 24:41.760]  Oh, I figured out how that works.
[24:41.760 --> 24:44.760]  You people want to destroy civilization.
[24:44.760 --> 24:48.760]  Continuing.
[24:48.760 --> 24:53.760]  Franks' book argued that the Constitution is in the service of white male supremacy.
[24:53.760 --> 24:58.760]  Oh, yeah, the Bill of Rights and Constitution is in the service of white male supremacists.
[24:58.760 --> 25:02.760]  This woman's a race baiter using race to control people.
[25:02.760 --> 25:04.760]  A horrible monster.
[25:04.760 --> 25:08.760]  The Second Amendment is a conservative fetish.
[25:08.760 --> 25:11.760]  And the First Amendment is a liberal fetish, well, not anymore,
[25:11.760 --> 25:14.760]  that is less obvious but no less influential.
[25:14.760 --> 25:18.760]  Yeah, that evil First Amendment, according to the description of the work
[25:18.760 --> 25:22.760]  written by Stanford University Press.
[25:22.760 --> 25:26.760]  The First and Second Amendment tend to be interpreted in aggressively
[25:26.760 --> 25:29.760]  individualistic ways, can't have those,
[25:29.760 --> 25:33.760]  that ignore the reality of conflict among competing rights.
[25:33.760 --> 25:41.760]  Oh, much of UN talk.
[25:41.760 --> 25:43.760]  Let's continue.
[25:43.760 --> 25:47.760]  Now, moving on from that, I'm not going to read the rest of it.
[25:47.760 --> 25:51.760]  Pentagon issues new rules to stop rise of extremism in the military.
[25:51.760 --> 25:55.760]  I went and read the new rules and it says,
[25:55.760 --> 25:58.760]  liking something.
[25:58.760 --> 26:01.760]  And it's not like they like, say, the KKK,
[26:01.760 --> 26:03.760]  so they call them in and say, what are you doing?
[26:03.760 --> 26:05.760]  Still, you shouldn't be surveilling the troops.
[26:05.760 --> 26:09.760]  Still, you shouldn't be having the ADL scan everybody and put them in databases
[26:09.760 --> 26:11.760]  and have AI report back.
[26:11.760 --> 26:12.760]  Still, you shouldn't be doing that.
[26:12.760 --> 26:18.760]  But okay, no, no, it's not like you liked an al-Qaeda video saying,
[26:18.760 --> 26:21.760]  we're going to behead people.
[26:21.760 --> 26:22.760]  And you got to be asked, why'd you do that?
[26:22.760 --> 26:23.760]  Still dangerous to have that surveillance.
[26:23.760 --> 26:24.760]  No, no, no.
[26:24.760 --> 26:28.760]  It's stuff like the Gadsden flag or President Trump or questioning
[26:28.760 --> 26:31.760]  election fraud or questioning force inoculations.
[26:31.760 --> 26:35.760]  It's the same stuff that's in the terrorism official directive of
[26:35.760 --> 26:38.760]  President Biden the puppet from June that says questioning vaccines,
[26:38.760 --> 26:41.760]  questioning lock-downs, questioning election fraud,
[26:41.760 --> 26:45.760]  questioning open borders is terrorist and that the Pentagon and military
[26:45.760 --> 26:48.760]  CIA must degrade and disrupt.
[26:48.760 --> 26:51.760]  When the Green Berets bust into some place and kill somebody,
[26:51.760 --> 26:54.760]  that's called disrupting and degrading something.
[26:54.760 --> 26:57.760]  I mean, literal military assassination terms,
[26:57.760 --> 27:00.760]  hit squad terms for you.
[27:00.760 --> 27:04.760]  And now it's the open purge of the military 2.0.
[27:04.760 --> 27:06.760]  You thought critical race theory was bad.
[27:06.760 --> 27:08.760]  You thought all the gender BS was bad.
[27:08.760 --> 27:09.760]  You thought all that was bad.
[27:09.760 --> 27:13.760]  No, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[27:13.760 --> 27:17.760]  Because the military is where people sign over some of their rights
[27:17.760 --> 27:19.760]  and quote, defense of the country.
[27:19.760 --> 27:24.760]  That's being abused by the occupiers of our nation to destroy our military.
[27:24.760 --> 27:27.760]  To totally shut it down.
[27:27.760 --> 27:32.760]  This has all been planned.
[27:32.760 --> 27:37.760]  Meanwhile, doing Satan's work, Pentagon orders company to stop
[27:37.760 --> 27:39.760]  making faith-based dog tags.
[27:39.760 --> 27:45.760]  Pentagon for the commissaries and PX's had it where people could order
[27:45.760 --> 27:48.760]  their own Christian custom dog tags with their number.
[27:48.760 --> 27:57.760]  So they could have John 316 or Isaiah 417.
[27:57.760 --> 28:00.760]  But no, they said that's hateful, including saying,
[28:00.760 --> 28:02.760]  courage in Christ, not allowed.
[28:02.760 --> 28:07.760]  You can't physically have under your clothing something about God.
[28:07.760 --> 28:10.760]  That's satanic group running our military.
[28:10.760 --> 28:16.760]  The Pentagon recently ordered shields of strength to stop making faith-based dog tags.
[28:16.760 --> 28:18.760]  The company has been making the tags for 20 years,
[28:18.760 --> 28:25.760]  but the Pentagon got one complaint in order to stop making the faith-based dog tags.
[28:25.760 --> 28:28.760]  It's not a woke Pentagon that caved bullies.
[28:28.760 --> 28:30.760]  They're right on the whole thing.
[28:30.760 --> 28:32.760]  Hope there's other censorship.
[28:32.760 --> 28:36.760]  Twitter censors account that alleged another CNN pedophile scandal,
[28:36.760 --> 28:37.760]  ongoing.
[28:37.760 --> 28:40.760]  Yeah, that's who these people are.
[28:40.760 --> 28:43.760]  That's who these people are.
[28:43.760 --> 28:45.760]  So that's just some of the attack on free speech.
[28:45.760 --> 28:49.760]  While they silence us, while they roll out deadly injections against all of us,
[28:49.760 --> 28:51.760]  no matter what color we are, we got that huge news.
[28:51.760 --> 28:53.760]  The biggest yet on the COVID takeover.

[29:59.760 --> 30:07.760]  We're here to believe that Christmas 2021 is here and soon will be in the year 2022.
[30:07.760 --> 30:16.760]  Everything the globalists plan on doing, their entire operations hinge on you psychologically,
[30:16.760 --> 30:22.760]  not understanding that they're trying to break your will, that they're trying to drive
[30:22.760 --> 30:28.760]  you into submission, but if you're aware of this basic fact and how they are scientifically
[30:28.760 --> 30:31.760]  following you, then you're basically immune.
[30:31.760 --> 30:36.760]  This is next level information on how to take control of your mind.
[30:36.760 --> 30:40.760]  It's how I've been able to stand against the incredible attacks they've carried out because
[30:40.760 --> 30:42.760]  I'm able to connect to the divine.
[30:42.760 --> 30:48.760]  I'm able to transcend this dimension simply by becoming aware of the fact that I already
[30:48.760 --> 30:49.760]  transcended it.
[30:49.760 --> 30:56.760]  So until Christmas day, we're offering Reset Wars, our incredible two-part course for 25%
[30:56.760 --> 30:59.760]  off at resetwars.com.
[30:59.760 --> 31:05.960]  Resetwars.com is the coordinates on the Internet where you can find the most important information
[31:05.960 --> 31:10.120]  I've produced in 28 years on air.
[31:10.120 --> 31:12.480]  A lot of what's in the courses is known.
[31:12.480 --> 31:18.000]  A lot isn't, but it's my particular perspective and my definitions and my way of seeing the
[31:18.000 --> 31:19.000]  world.
[31:19.000 --> 31:20.520]  It doesn't mean it's perfectly right.
[31:20.520 --> 31:24.400]  As the Bible says, we all see through a rose color darkly, but we've proven that we've
[31:24.400 --> 31:29.240]  got some of the clearest cutting-edge discernment out there.
[31:29.240 --> 31:34.480]  And I want you to have access to this information because you need these tools, in my experience
[31:34.480 --> 31:38.160]  at least, to stand for the globalists and not let them break your will.
[31:38.160 --> 31:45.800]  And so through Christmas Day, the course is 25% off at resetwars.com, and it's not just
[31:45.800 --> 31:49.280]  an amazing game-changing consciousness-raising course.

[33:01.040 --> 33:19.120]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:19.120 --> 33:26.280]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance, live from Austin, Texas.
[33:26.280 --> 33:33.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:33.520 --> 33:36.560]  Now is the time to take action.
[33:36.560 --> 33:39.000]  Now is the time to be peacefully in the streets.
[33:39.000 --> 33:43.160]  Now is the time to have your voices raised and warn the public that what the children
[33:43.160 --> 33:47.800]  are being given is very dangerous and does not protect them from COVID and is linked
[33:47.800 --> 33:51.960]  directly to massive heart attacks, blood clots and death.
[33:51.960 --> 33:57.920]  We're going to hit a bunch of that news here right now.
[33:57.920 --> 34:01.360]  But we really are dealing with authoritarians that are just out in the open gaslighting
[34:01.360 --> 34:02.960]  the population.
[34:02.960 --> 34:07.800]  And so all we've got to do is point out that it's wrong and the people will join us.
[34:07.800 --> 34:10.440]  We will win the fight.
[34:10.440 --> 34:14.480]  But that's why the censorship is so massive and that's why they've incrementally basically
[34:14.480 --> 34:20.840]  shut down almost everyone.
[34:20.840 --> 34:25.880]  Whether there are no real prominent voices left, even talk radio is censoring conservatives
[34:25.880 --> 34:30.920]  that question election fraud or question the so-called vaccines and that's why independent
[34:30.920 --> 34:35.680]  networks like Info Wars are beyond critical.
[34:35.680 --> 34:46.080]  What we're witnessing is a scientific plan to turn our free societies into oppressive
[34:46.080 --> 34:48.080]  scientific dictatorships.
[34:48.080 --> 34:53.400]  But I was trying to think of a headline this morning for the live show and I never went
[34:53.400 --> 34:59.640]  and even did it just because I don't have words to come up with something epic enough.
[34:59.640 --> 35:04.080]  But we are now living in the post-free world.
[35:04.080 --> 35:09.800]  We are now about to go into year three of a worldwide UN run corporate technocracy and
[35:09.800 --> 35:11.520]  I don't say that to scare people.
[35:11.520 --> 35:18.160]  I say it because that's where we are.
[35:18.160 --> 35:25.560]  I have a close family member who was never really anorexic in their life and then just
[35:25.560 --> 35:29.360]  not paying attention for whatever reason, they're very happy and very nice.
[35:29.360 --> 35:35.760]  They just stopped eating the last year and they lost 50 pounds and they were never big
[35:35.760 --> 35:44.680]  and then they started basically having dementia-like symptoms and I got in their face about it and
[35:44.680 --> 35:48.720]  started making them take vitamins and minerals and making them eat for just a month, going
[35:48.720 --> 35:54.320]  to their house three times a day in some cases and making them eat.
[35:54.320 --> 35:57.080]  Now they look 20 years younger and are running around having a great time.
[35:57.080 --> 36:03.320]  That's what I'm telling you with the TVs and the iPads and they're studies that show this
[36:03.320 --> 36:12.480]  but it's putting people into a trance and the chemicals and the food and the water.
[36:12.480 --> 36:17.640]  To our not just people close to me but everybody seeing it and the statistics showing it, people
[36:17.640 --> 36:25.400]  that are aware of it become irritated by it and become angry about it.
[36:25.400 --> 36:27.560]  But that's a minority of people.
[36:27.560 --> 36:31.840]  Everybody else, even if they still are a patriot at heart and still they love God, they are
[36:31.840 --> 36:38.440]  being slowly mesmerized into a sleep state where they're going into a type of coma-like
[36:38.440 --> 36:42.160]  state that they've got to be gotten out of.
[36:42.160 --> 36:45.240]  And I know you're all witnessing it as well.
[36:45.240 --> 36:48.600]  And we see it statistically with young people where I didn't matter if they're black or
[36:48.600 --> 36:53.080]  white or Hispanic or Asian, the IQs in the Western world are 20, 30 points what they
[36:53.080 --> 37:01.240]  were a generation ago, South Korea, the US, you name it.
[37:01.240 --> 37:02.240]  What was that movie?
[37:02.240 --> 37:06.880]  It was a really good movie and it was based on a TV show that I never really watched until
[37:06.880 --> 37:10.640]  after I saw the movie and then I went and bought the DVD set and thought it was pretty
[37:10.640 --> 37:13.080]  good for a low-budget science fiction TV show.
[37:13.080 --> 37:15.360]  The TV show was Firefly.
[37:15.360 --> 37:16.880]  What was the movie?
[37:16.880 --> 37:19.000]  Serenity, serenity.
[37:19.000 --> 37:25.120]  And in the movie, no one knows why 30 years before suddenly these crazy psycho people show
[37:25.120 --> 37:30.480]  up who just fly around in space murdering and killing and are basically like satanic
[37:30.480 --> 37:31.480]  demons.
[37:31.480 --> 37:37.000]  And they finally find out where they came from, that the government was doing a test.
[37:37.000 --> 37:43.320]  It's a big leftist, socialist, globalist, galactic empire.
[37:43.320 --> 37:47.360]  And they find out that they put Prozac into the atmosphere basically.
[37:47.360 --> 37:55.000]  A high-tech Prozac that ended war, ended violence, ended everything, but then basically made
[37:55.000 --> 38:02.720]  99% of people just go into a coma and die.
[38:02.720 --> 38:06.360]  But the 1% turned into psychotic killers.
[38:06.360 --> 38:09.800]  And you know, you know that's all Carnegie Endowment.
[38:09.800 --> 38:10.960]  I mean, that was their plan.
[38:10.960 --> 38:16.200]  All of this has been laid out since the 20s where they created the theoretical systems
[38:16.200 --> 38:17.680]  they're now building.
[38:17.680 --> 38:22.880]  And they even theorized, not in that movie, I know where they got it from, with some of
[38:22.880 --> 38:31.640]  the top globalist thinkers from the 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s like Bertrand Russell, is that
[38:31.640 --> 38:38.840]  the majority will die and just turn off and be slowly killed, but that a small percentage
[38:38.840 --> 38:45.400]  will become the super wild men who are immune to it and who will have high intellects but
[38:45.400 --> 38:51.520]  will also be basically psychotic killers.
[38:51.520 --> 38:58.320]  You may have heard of that allegory before with H.D. Wells and the Morlocks and the Elois.
[38:58.320 --> 39:03.760]  Where the Morlocks are conscious and have 200 IQs, but they're like vampires, and they
[39:03.760 --> 39:08.680]  feed on the Eloi that live in the light in a garden of Eden on the surface, because
[39:08.680 --> 39:10.600]  ignorance is bliss.
[39:10.600 --> 39:19.000]  And so that's really what Firefly and then I guess what they made the movie into, Serenity
[39:19.000 --> 39:20.720]  is the archetype.
[39:20.720 --> 39:27.360]  And that's really true, like I'm a Morlock, even though I don't want to be a Morlock.
[39:27.360 --> 39:31.320]  I mean, I'm like Bill Gates, I'm like Klaus Schwab, I know how it all works, I understand
[39:31.320 --> 39:35.920]  all of it, except I don't like killing the Eloi.
[39:35.920 --> 39:36.920]  It's true.
[39:36.920 --> 39:42.840]  I am a brutal killing machine of I need to be, I'm not even proud of that.
[39:42.840 --> 39:46.680]  And I understand and I see them like, I see the general public as lemmings and I want
[39:46.680 --> 39:47.680]  to wake them up.
[39:47.680 --> 39:54.200]  But you know, I just want to ask the actual Morlocks, because I mean, I'm not saying I'm
[39:54.200 --> 40:01.080]  as bad as they are, but I'm a fallen creature, I mean, I see what they see.
[40:01.080 --> 40:04.240]  Don't you understand you can escape that through Christ, but they don't know that and they
[40:04.240 --> 40:07.720]  don't want to know that, and they want to just continue on, so that's why you see that
[40:07.720 --> 40:13.840]  in the Vincent Price movie, The Last Man on Earth, and you see it again in the remake
[40:13.840 --> 40:22.440]  of Omega Man, and you see it again in the remake of that original film into I Am Legend.
[40:22.440 --> 40:28.240]  And it's saying to the world, the universe, can a scientist decide to not give us the
[40:28.240 --> 40:33.720]  injection that turns us into psychotic killers, which is the apple or the falling from grace?
[40:33.720 --> 40:42.200]  And now they're trying to give us a shot, not to actually lift us up and empower us,
[40:42.200 --> 40:48.080]  but right up front, they're giving us a poison to take control of us.
[40:48.080 --> 40:51.760]  And so this is the real Illuminati secrets, ladies and gentlemen.
[40:51.760 --> 40:58.040]  I mean, this is what's really going on, and the public's going to want to go outside,
[40:58.040 --> 41:00.800]  the public's going to want to have their freedoms again, and they're going to be told it's the
[41:00.800 --> 41:05.400]  un-injected, the un-vaccinated, that are the reason you can't do that, even though the
[41:05.400 --> 41:09.360]  facts and science show it's the opposite, they'll just repeat the word science over
[41:09.360 --> 41:14.000]  and over and over again, and you can't help them.
[41:14.000 --> 41:19.880]  And so leftists that are very, very weak and very, very alone, most of them have fetal
[41:19.880 --> 41:27.120]  alcohol syndrome and serious brain damage and didn't get breastfed, the low-level minions,
[41:27.120 --> 41:31.680]  the kind of Wrenfields of the left, they actually kind of know this and think of they can be
[41:31.680 --> 41:40.080]  liars and they can be psychotic and they can prove themselves to the Morlocks, to the Dracula's,
[41:40.080 --> 41:43.720]  that they can become a Dracula, and that's what Wrenfield's wanting.
[41:43.720 --> 41:49.040]  He's wanting Dracula to bite him, but Dracula won't do it.
[41:49.040 --> 41:53.520]  And so you see it in Bram Stoker and you see it in H.G. Wells and you see it everywhere
[41:53.520 --> 41:59.280]  and they're telling you what's going on spiritually, we don't need to become Morlocks, we need
[41:59.280 --> 42:05.000]  to become Christ-like, we need Jesus, and that's what's in Omega Man.
[42:05.000 --> 42:09.200]  He finally finds his blood's got the cure because he had the antibodies and he's trying
[42:09.200 --> 42:12.920]  to save them and they said, dude, we don't want to be saved and they kill him and hang
[42:12.920 --> 42:17.600]  him up on a cross.
[42:17.600 --> 42:22.160]  But the people he's already trained go and they get the blood and they go and ride off
[42:22.160 --> 42:28.280]  into the hills and into the woods to build their new society with the blood of Christ.
[42:28.280 --> 42:33.200]  I mean, it's telling you right there, you need Jesus.
[42:33.200 --> 42:35.760]  You're not going to find Jesus in these churches, they're controlled.
[42:35.760 --> 42:40.360]  Of course, Satan gets control of the churches and puts their system up front.
[42:40.360 --> 42:44.360]  And we're not saying Charlton Heston's Jesus, we're saying they'll have some crazy, fake
[42:44.360 --> 42:46.720]  Christian Pharisee Bible thumpers say that.
[42:46.720 --> 42:50.080]  It's the archetype, it's they're telling you.
[42:50.080 --> 42:54.600]  He puts those images out because they know you know deep down they're real.
[42:54.600 --> 42:55.600]  We'll be right back.

[44:36.080 --> 44:37.760]  I mean, we could just do marketing campaigns.
[44:37.760 --> 44:39.960]  I think for kids, that'd be great.
[44:39.960 --> 44:45.760]  Calcium good for them, the Vitamin D. So, that's at infowarsstore.com.
[44:45.760 --> 44:48.560]  And again, it's your support there that keeps us on the air.
[44:48.560 --> 44:53.560]  So, the supplements, the shirts, the air filters, the water filters, the emergency food supplies,
[44:53.560 --> 44:56.600]  the emergency supplies at infowarsstore.com.
[44:56.600 --> 44:58.160]  Your support there keeps us on the air.
[44:58.160 --> 45:00.440]  We cannot thank you enough.
[45:00.440 --> 45:06.400]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare and with poisons
[45:06.400 --> 45:08.160]  and chemicals added to the food.
[45:08.160 --> 45:09.160]  It's all come out.
[45:09.160 --> 45:12.880]  And they're doing that not because we're weak, but because we're made the image of
[45:12.880 --> 45:19.160]  God, the Creator, and we are powerful and the social engineers fear that so much.
[45:19.160 --> 45:23.520]  So, that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up
[45:23.520 --> 45:27.320]  with the boy, is it true?
[45:27.320 --> 45:33.160]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[45:33.160 --> 45:36.960]  They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural
[45:36.960 --> 45:43.640]  death because they know we are strong and they know in the end, they signed on to God
[45:43.640 --> 45:45.640]  of this world who is a loser.
[45:45.640 --> 45:49.520]  And that's why it's so important that everybody keep infowars on the air now more than ever.
[45:49.520 --> 45:53.760]  Because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalists are manifesting and setting
[45:53.760 --> 45:55.560]  up is safe handling.
[45:55.560 --> 45:59.960]  And we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the beast they just announced.
[45:59.960 --> 46:08.160]  It's hard to believe that Christmas 2021 is here and soon will be in the year 2022.
[46:08.160 --> 46:17.440]  Everything the globalists plan on doing, their entire operations hinge on you psychologically
[46:17.440 --> 46:23.240]  not understanding that they're trying to break your will, that they're trying to drive you
[46:23.240 --> 46:24.240]  into submission.
[46:24.240 --> 46:30.320]  But if you're aware of this basic fact and how they are scientifically controlling you,
[46:30.320 --> 46:32.840]  then you're basically immune.
[46:32.840 --> 46:37.320]  This is next level information on how to take control of your mind.
[46:37.320 --> 46:41.200]  It's how I've been able to stand against the incredible attacks they've carried out because
[46:41.200 --> 46:43.720]  I'm able to connect to the divine.
[46:43.720 --> 46:49.280]  I'm able to transcend this dimension simply by becoming aware of the fact that I already
[46:49.280 --> 46:50.680]  transcended it.
[46:50.680 --> 46:57.200]  So until Christmas Day, we're offering Reset Wars our incredible two part course for 25%
[46:57.200 --> 47:01.520]  off at resetwars.com.
[47:01.520 --> 47:06.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[47:06.000 --> 47:22.080]  It's Alex Jones.
[47:22.080 --> 47:26.360]  The Winter Solstice is here, the longest night of the year, the shortest day.
[47:26.360 --> 47:31.400]  And that's today's headline, America enters its longest night as globalist target patriots
[47:31.400 --> 47:37.480]  in the military, so any gads and flags, any discussion of election fraud, you as a citizen
[47:37.480 --> 47:41.360]  aren't allowed to have any political views unless it's SJW.
[47:41.360 --> 47:47.280]  This is the take down and takeover of our country, Ali Alexander is going to be exclusively
[47:47.280 --> 47:48.760]  joining us in studio.
[47:48.760 --> 47:52.720]  He sat for eight hours in front of the kangaroo January 6 committee.
[47:52.720 --> 47:56.720]  He went in there with an open heart, very friendly, very nice, gave them all the documents,
[47:56.720 --> 48:02.120]  spent almost everything he had on a top lawyer to go over everything and they treated him
[48:02.120 --> 48:05.760]  like garbage and he's pissed.
[48:05.760 --> 48:09.080]  And I only got a second hand from Roger Stone to talk to him, he'll be getting it first
[48:09.080 --> 48:13.040]  hand here in studio in just a moment.
[48:13.040 --> 48:17.640]  It's not that I don't trust Ali, he's in that green room right there, it's just that
[48:17.640 --> 48:22.480]  the way the committee is so criminal, so evil that I will not talk to him on the phone and
[48:22.480 --> 48:27.040]  I will not be in a room alone with him so that they can't lie about us.
[48:27.040 --> 48:29.760]  That's how serious this is, okay?
[48:29.760 --> 48:34.120]  That's how out of control this is, but he'll be here in studio for you and we really appreciate
[48:34.120 --> 48:35.120]  him.
[48:35.120 --> 48:41.280]  That's coming up at six after next hour, so 15 minutes away and he'll probably go into
[48:41.280 --> 48:44.280]  the fourth hour with us or third hour with us as well.
[48:44.280 --> 48:47.760]  He's here in Texas and again breaking his silence and we're very, very glad he's a fellow
[48:47.760 --> 48:51.920]  Texan that he's going to be here with us.
[48:51.920 --> 48:57.840]  I just went into my whole parable of the Morlock versus the Eloy and that's how the global
[48:57.840 --> 49:03.640]  of see everything, creditor and prey and how I'm trying to give people in the mode who
[49:03.640 --> 49:10.000]  are prey to stop acting like prey and that's why we sell a coffee cup that I designed that
[49:10.000 --> 49:17.120]  on one side shows a wolf chasing a sheep around Info Wars and on the other side a big mean
[49:17.120 --> 49:24.240]  sheep dog chasing the wolf and you want to be the sheep dog, you don't want to be the
[49:24.240 --> 49:30.240]  wolf, you don't want to be the sheep, you want to be the sheep dog and that's what it is
[49:30.240 --> 49:34.480]  to be Christlike, ladies and gentlemen and I'm not claiming I'm Christlike, I just know
[49:34.480 --> 49:36.960]  what Christlike is.
[49:36.960 --> 49:43.640]  All right, let's go ahead and get into the stack of news that after Ollie leaves us in
[49:43.640 --> 49:49.000]  the middle of the third hour, I'm going to go into more detail on because it's just incredible.
[49:49.000 --> 49:52.600]  This is why they're silencing, this is why they're censoring, this is why the ADL has
[49:52.600 --> 49:56.880]  like government contracts to surveil the American people and report back on us in a lifetime.
[49:56.880 --> 49:59.880]  I mean, this is just crazy.
[49:59.880 --> 50:04.600]  Democrats urge health officials to require vaccination or negative tests for domestic
[50:04.600 --> 50:05.600]  flights.
[50:05.600 --> 50:09.040]  Biden's set to make announcements today and the word is that's along those lines.
[50:09.040 --> 50:14.320]  Unbelievable tyranny, medical ID, that's the basis of the World Social Credit Score ID
[50:14.320 --> 50:16.040]  carbon tax.
[50:16.040 --> 50:20.280]  And here they are a few months ahead of us in the EU, EU sets binding nine month validity
[50:20.280 --> 50:25.880]  of vaccinations for COVID-19 travel says you have to have four shots to be able to travel
[50:25.880 --> 50:29.100]  and they say they're going to start upping the number of the European Commission today
[50:29.100 --> 50:33.540]  adopted rules that will make the European Union COVID-19 certificate valid for travel
[50:33.540 --> 50:37.760]  nine months after the completion of the primary vaccination schedule.
[50:37.760 --> 50:42.520]  And remember when they did the steel deal in 56 you can go read the treaty just about
[50:42.520 --> 50:48.560]  oh the steel collective agree not to have tariffs and to let our steel travel within
[50:48.560 --> 50:55.440]  a 10 member country block now it's 30 member block and now it's an unelected steel cooperative
[50:55.440 --> 51:00.160]  that has unelected chairman that two weeks ago said forced inoculations and now it's
[51:00.160 --> 51:01.160]  begun.
[51:01.160 --> 51:06.240]  They're getting ready for February to force it door to door.
[51:06.240 --> 51:09.480]  People women being drug out of grocery stores taking to jail because they have a COVID pass
[51:09.480 --> 51:14.200]  those are the videos so many of my came and play them all year on air.
[51:14.200 --> 51:17.680]  Think about that and just overnight now boom that's where you are.
[51:17.680 --> 51:18.680]  Wow.
[51:18.680 --> 51:19.680]  Talk about frightening.
[51:19.680 --> 51:24.520]  We should say hey America's not that free why are you putting down you know other countries
[51:24.520 --> 51:31.600]  well yeah we're the best house in a bad neighborhood now we're learning how special America was.
[51:31.600 --> 51:37.720]  So continuing EU sets binding nine month validity of vaccinations for COVID-19 travel but it
[51:37.720 --> 51:45.120]  says other countries inside are making them stiffer and the EU is encouraging that.
[51:45.120 --> 51:50.340]  Bill would give New York Governor authority to indefinitely that means forever detain
[51:50.340 --> 51:54.440]  cases or suspected cases of any contagious disease.
[51:54.440 --> 51:57.240]  Oh where'd Bob go oh well he was coughing.
[51:57.240 --> 52:00.480]  They have senators in Australia that criticize the government they come grab them at their
[52:00.480 --> 52:06.080]  house they're holding them three weeks later saying you're not sick but you made a phone
[52:06.080 --> 52:10.760]  call out and criticize this we're keeping you longer as punishment oh we're just like
[52:10.760 --> 52:15.240]  oh yeah they set up camps yeah people go there to criticize what we do it's no big deal and
[52:15.240 --> 52:19.640]  now I told you it's here told you it was coming told you a year ago it would be announced
[52:19.640 --> 52:25.480]  by this winter because it's in the CDC documents about the shielding in place rule.
[52:25.480 --> 52:32.160]  Oh but look Queen Elizabeth who's been triple jab we're told yeah right and monkeys fly.
[52:32.160 --> 52:39.080]  Queen Elizabeth cancels Christmas 95 year old queen will celebrate at Windsor Castle
[52:39.080 --> 52:46.120]  as COVID-19 Omicron variant spreads across the UK so oh she has to hide out and you've
[52:46.120 --> 52:49.560]  all got to wear a mask because you took the shots but oh sorry they don't protect you

[53:14.560 --> 53:22.320]  arrhythmia during the study period which is more than 10,000 times the average for death
[53:22.320 --> 53:31.120]  or heart problems one in 100 vaccine individuals were admitted to the hospital or died with
[53:31.120 --> 53:36.160]  arrhythmia during study period nothing like your heart not working anymore and going into

[54:52.920 --> 54:58.360]  and irresponsible fact check so even the British medical journal is now moving away knowing
[54:58.360 --> 55:02.680]  that the whole ship of big farmers coming down or we're going to go down with it and
[55:02.680 --> 55:07.520]  they went enlisted the fact that Pfizer covered up the adverse reactions and they say it is
[55:07.520 --> 55:13.320]  causing major heart attacks and problems and that it's on the insert now it does it remember
[55:13.320 --> 55:18.600]  what Facebook and Twitter and Instagram owned by Facebook said just last month about a month

[58:59.120 --> 59:04.320]  best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic in the volcanic soil better
[59:04.320 --> 59:08.200]  than guatemalan coffee and yeah we buy it from the little farmers that you know the media
[59:08.200 --> 59:11.640]  calls communists but really they're just a commune and whatever the point is is that
[59:11.640 --> 59:14.880]  it's good coffee and we've got it and the farmers don't let the mexican government
[59:14.880 --> 59:17.840]  take over so i actually buy this from the mexican rebels and i've been buying it for
[59:17.840 --> 59:21.360]  what 14 years and the price has never gone up the same stuff sold at Whole Foods under
[59:21.360 --> 59:25.240]  another name for about 50 percent more for pound and i just think it's some of the best
[59:25.240 --> 59:29.200]  coffee you're gonna find anywhere it's wake up america patriot blend from the Chiapas
[59:29.200 --> 59:37.040]  rebels literally um in fact i'm gonna tell you a little story um yeah i'd like to i'm
[59:37.040 --> 59:42.040]  saying you want to believe it anyway so it's infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this
[59:42.040 --> 1:00:00.040]  operation and if you don't find us you don't want to steer that's fine if you are receiving
[1:00:00.040 --> 1:00:08.040]  this transmission you are the resistance
[1:00:08.040 --> 1:00:14.040]  system it gives you heart attacks and cancer yeah it works real good by the way i've been
[1:00:14.040 --> 1:00:19.760]  reading the writings for years i'm not a catholic but uh i tell you this guy i gave services
[1:00:19.760 --> 1:00:24.520]  in town in austin i'd definitely go go listen to it i'd i'd be a catholic you've evolved
[1:00:24.520 --> 1:00:32.120]  of all the arx bishop sounding like this everything that carlo maria vagano says is just a hundred
[1:00:32.120 --> 1:00:39.280]  percent on target from my view and he explains that there is a global alliance people empowered
[1:00:39.280 --> 1:00:45.480]  by christ and the holy spirit transcending the third dimension that is battling satan's
[1:00:45.480 --> 1:00:51.120]  takeover of claus schlaub and bill gates the new world order and that this is the beginning
[1:00:51.120 --> 1:00:56.040]  of the end of days and i can't disagree with it and the head of the greek orthodox church
[1:00:56.040 --> 1:01:03.320]  is saying the same thing the head of the russian orthodox church uh the eastern church is saying
[1:01:03.320 --> 1:01:10.840]  that as well now obviously this this cardinal just like the big top german cardinal who's
[1:01:10.840 --> 1:01:16.200]  actually the head of the vatican court came out and said exactly what this cardinal saying
[1:01:16.200 --> 1:01:22.520]  last week this is a world government depopulation takeover this is satan's main move now can
[1:01:22.520 --> 1:01:26.920]  they say hey the popes have captured globalists that got in here no but regardless we never
[1:01:26.920 --> 1:01:30.840]  thought about the vatican before catholics before you can catholics they're great people
[1:01:30.840 --> 1:01:35.000]  the point is obviously there's been a lot of wickedness in high places everywhere these
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:40.400]  guys are actually sounds like alex jones because it's they're seeing the same thing so whether
[1:01:40.400 --> 1:01:43.760]  you're tucker carlson or whether you're joe rogan or whether you're alex jones or whether
[1:01:43.760 --> 1:01:53.320]  you are cardinal carlo maria bagano or the top german cardinal i mean you better decide
[1:01:53.320 --> 1:01:58.920]  what sides are on because you sign on to this baby you're cut off from god there's you don't
[1:01:58.920 --> 1:02:03.320]  need the pope to say you're gonna be excommunicated you don't need some preacher to tell you god's
[1:02:03.320 --> 1:02:08.280]  cutting you off i can tell you that you sign on to this and he's saying that too you are
[1:02:08.280 --> 1:02:11.800]  gonna be cut off now if you take the shot as you didn't know or you give it to your kid
[1:02:11.800 --> 1:02:16.680]  as you didn't know that's one thing but if you get into this whole this whole spirit
[1:02:16.680 --> 1:02:20.920]  this whole operation this whole thing you are cut off from god because this is taken
[1:02:20.920 --> 1:02:25.920]  over your dna this is turning off people's white blood cells on record this is giving
[1:02:25.920 --> 1:02:31.320]  people heart attacks and mass one out of a hundred people that took the vaccine according
[1:02:31.320 --> 1:02:36.240]  to british medical journal in the uk died of a heart attack or my car died of heart
[1:02:36.240 --> 1:02:43.360]  swelling i mean i mean i mean this is you heard about the nazis you heard about the
[1:02:43.360 --> 1:02:46.680]  communists you heard about gingis con you heard about all these other people you know
[1:02:46.680 --> 1:02:52.520]  about north korea this is happening in live time but none of us are used to it coming
[1:02:52.520 --> 1:02:57.280]  from a needle it was that meme a few months ago i said was the most important yet that
[1:02:57.280 --> 1:03:04.480]  said the history and development and evolution of warfare and one was a stone and then it
[1:03:04.480 --> 1:03:13.320]  was a spear and then it was an arrow and then it was a bullet and then it was a missile
[1:03:13.320 --> 1:03:19.760]  and then it was a hypodermic needle and so i don't care if you're a buddhist a muslim
[1:03:19.760 --> 1:03:28.480]  a catholic a protestant black white old young polka dotted you better decide which side
[1:03:28.480 --> 1:03:34.840]  you're on but i'm telling you this this message from the archbishop is just dead on he said
[1:03:34.840 --> 1:03:39.880]  you're an alliance of humanity against satan he goes out he goes no matter who you are
[1:03:39.880 --> 1:03:43.840]  if you know this is going on that's the holy spirit working through you you need to stand
[1:03:43.840 --> 1:03:50.440]  against us now in an alliance of anti-globalism you know i registered the name years ago we
[1:03:50.440 --> 1:03:54.840]  haven't launched it yet but i wanted to launch the anti-globalist you know alliance of pro-humans
[1:03:54.840 --> 1:04:00.120]  i have a bunch of names a pro-human union a pro-human alliance we've got a bunch of
[1:04:00.120 --> 1:04:07.000]  URLs but i mean that's what it is is a pro-human alliance that's why they're dividing us on
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:11.360]  race and and and all this stuff right now and then we get attacked on race we got to
[1:04:11.360 --> 1:04:15.360]  respond to it again they suck you into it it doesn't mean everybody's got beefs against
[1:04:15.360 --> 1:04:19.240]  each other of course we do they'll got problems their own families our bosses our employees
[1:04:19.240 --> 1:04:23.640]  whatever the point is we can set all that aside later and kill each other if we want
[1:04:23.640 --> 1:04:31.000]  to the globalists are attacking us now if you like of a rhinoceros was running over
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  you and killing your family and you're like fighting with your neighbor over how high

[1:06:17.720 --> 1:06:30.480]  and it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say i don't know what's
[1:06:30.480 --> 1:06:37.680]  going to happen at the end of this but you want to fight you better believe you got one
[1:06:37.680 --> 1:06:51.920]  in the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[1:06:51.920 --> 1:06:55.760]  now the committees decided to shut down one of the most popular journalists on the right
[1:06:55.760 --> 1:07:01.280]  alex jones yes journalist jones is often mocked for his flamboyance but the truth is he has
[1:07:01.280 --> 1:07:06.640]  been a far better guide to reality in recent years in other words a far better journalist
[1:07:06.640 --> 1:07:13.480]  than say nbc news national security correspondent kendall anion or margaret brennan of cbs
[1:07:13.480 --> 1:07:18.480]  alex jones never bought the russia hoax not for a second and if jones sat down with tony
[1:07:18.480 --> 1:07:22.640]  fouchy he would ask him real questions just as journalists are supposed to do he wouldn't
[1:07:22.640 --> 1:07:28.240]  just slobber all over him but alex jones makes fun of joe biden so the january 6th committee
[1:07:28.240 --> 1:07:32.960]  is threatening him with prison now the irony here and there are many layers of irony here
[1:07:32.960 --> 1:07:38.920]  but the main one is that alex jones isn't simply innocent of inciting crime on january
[1:07:38.920 --> 1:07:45.320]  6th alex jones actively worked to prevent crimes from taking place on january 6th we're
[1:07:45.320 --> 1:07:49.000]  not running interference for alex jones and we're not guessing about it we happen to know
[1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:53.600]  this for a fact because we looked into it in some detail for patriot purge it's our three
[1:07:53.600 --> 1:08:03.960]  part documentary series on fox nation here are the facts so the republican party i just
[1:08:03.960 --> 1:08:10.880]  want them to hear this message look at this crowd we are the people that you must represent
[1:08:10.880 --> 1:08:14.800]  for real january the 6th was all about it was just about making sure that if you called
[1:08:14.800 --> 1:08:20.520]  yourself a conservative that you stood with the conservative movement and unfortunately
[1:08:20.520 --> 1:08:26.640]  it spiraled out of control we coordinated with the us capital police nearly every day a lot
[1:08:26.640 --> 1:08:31.280]  of people don't know that stop the steel actually had a permit on the capital grounds so not
[1:08:31.280 --> 1:08:36.720]  the capital itself and not the capital clause of the the capital grounds law 8 we had a permit
[1:08:36.720 --> 1:08:43.840]  so you let's just imagine this 20 to 50 thousand people inside the president's park we're sitting
[1:08:43.840 --> 1:08:48.680]  there at the very front i'm dead center of the president front row a trump campaign
[1:08:48.680 --> 1:08:54.400]  staffer walks up to me and says you know i'll leave there are people leaving the overflow
[1:08:54.400 --> 1:08:59.360]  and there are already tens of thousands of people at the us capital with your presence
[1:08:59.360 --> 1:09:03.960]  and the presence of alex jones why don't you guys walk down pennsylvania gather people
[1:09:03.960 --> 1:09:12.160]  together and then position them for your rally on lot 8 i wasn't at the capital when it descended
[1:09:12.160 --> 1:09:18.800]  into chaos and that's only by god's grace because i was scheduled to be there secret
[1:09:18.800 --> 1:09:25.320]  service let us out at a point where we would have been there when the first punch was thrown
[1:09:25.320 --> 1:09:29.960]  and that's strange the only reason that we weren't there is because we stopped and gave
[1:09:29.960 --> 1:09:41.760]  an impromptu speech i get a text from the campaign that you should get there and de-escalate
[1:09:41.760 --> 1:09:51.280]  because things are not going well so we started to approach the side of the capital where
[1:09:51.280 --> 1:09:56.960]  no protest had happened in november no protest had happened in december all i thought was
[1:09:56.960 --> 1:10:03.600]  i need to get them to the other side and i need to get them to lot 8 and all we have
[1:10:03.600 --> 1:10:14.960]  are equipped with our megaphones maybe a thousand people are listening to us 75 to 100
[1:10:14.960 --> 1:10:30.560]  thousand people there in front of us and it was very helpless feeling so the trail of
[1:10:30.560 --> 1:10:34.440]  that documentary got a lot of attention if you haven't seen the documentary itself we
[1:10:34.440 --> 1:10:38.200]  think that you should it's called patriot purge we think it is the most comprehensive
[1:10:38.200 --> 1:10:42.920]  the most honest the most fact based account of what actually happened on january 6th and
[1:10:42.920 --> 1:10:46.760]  what has happened on the basis of january 6th that has been made we're really proud
[1:10:46.760 --> 1:10:51.000]  of it you can start streaming fox nation by the way by going to tucker carlson dot com
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:58.880]  for two more days you get 90 days free all right ollie alexander is here ladies and

[1:11:20.200 --> 1:11:25.760]  so far that has been in the lion's den as he called it i guess roger stone said he talked
[1:11:25.760 --> 1:11:31.880]  to him that for eight hours and to tell you what happened but this is why it's so important
[1:11:31.880 --> 1:11:36.480]  they are trying to murder the first amendment they are trying to destroy the fourth amendment
[1:11:36.480 --> 1:11:40.760]  the fifth amendment and you have law professors in the news saying abolish the bill of rights
[1:11:40.760 --> 1:11:46.360]  the constitution first second amendment covered it last hour retired generals urged pentagon
[1:11:46.360 --> 1:11:53.240]  to declare martial law to stop a civil war in the midterms or 2024 you've seen the headlines
[1:11:53.240 --> 1:11:58.000]  and the january six uh committee promising to put everybody in jail when the head of
[1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:02.440]  the committee suing trump how are you a judge basically who's suing someone and then you're

[1:12:24.480 --> 1:12:27.840]  let you roll with this because this is a big interview but clearly this is bigger than
[1:12:27.840 --> 1:12:33.080]  alex jones bigger than ollie alexander bigger than roger stone bigger than trump this is
[1:12:33.080 --> 1:12:39.120]  about them now phrasing the whole war on terror not on russia not on china not on islamist
[1:12:39.120 --> 1:12:44.600]  not on the mexican mafia not on the collapsing borders but on us in the news saying that
[1:12:44.600 --> 1:12:51.600]  we're terrorist leaders and referring to it in the committee as a terror investigation
[1:12:51.600 --> 1:12:55.120]  well alex first i want to say i missed you you know i missed you buddy i mean i think
[1:12:55.120 --> 1:13:00.520]  that we did great work on behalf of our country in 2020 it was entirely peaceful i had never
[1:13:00.520 --> 1:13:04.760]  heard you you know in private or public advocate for violence and that's something i told the
[1:13:04.760 --> 1:13:08.760]  committee they wanted me to speculate on your mood and all kinds of other things but what
[1:13:08.760 --> 1:13:13.320]  people need to understand is that there is a war in fact going on on the bill of rights
[1:13:13.320 --> 1:13:17.960]  alex is exactly right the first amendment and the fourth amendment will be determined
[1:13:17.960 --> 1:13:23.280]  in the next few months to be true or false either congressional subpoenas can be wide
[1:13:23.280 --> 1:13:28.320]  ranging and unlimited in scope or we have a fourth amendment and i think that's why
[1:13:28.320 --> 1:13:32.800]  i'm suing the committee you're suing the committee general flinn just came out he's suing the
[1:13:32.800 --> 1:13:37.720]  committee mark meadows is suing the committee for trump campaign officials are suing the
[1:13:37.720 --> 1:13:42.960]  committee a great lawyer john eastman is suing the committee and all we're saying is we get
[1:13:42.960 --> 1:13:47.000]  that you have a job to do but you can't rifle through all of our phone records and all of
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:51.400]  our tweets and all of our facebook posts and our private communications you and i alex
[1:13:51.400 --> 1:13:56.080]  have decided to take the advice of our lawyers and basically not talking till i was deposed
[1:13:56.080 --> 1:14:00.120]  and that's infringed on our first amendment right you and i have a first amendment right
[1:14:00.120 --> 1:14:03.800]  to come to the american public to come to the info wars audience and talk about whatever
[1:14:03.800 --> 1:14:07.560]  the hell we want to talk about but you and i haven't been able to do that so they have
[1:14:07.560 --> 1:14:12.320]  infringed on our first amendment and all we're asking the courts for is relief on the fourth
[1:14:12.320 --> 1:14:17.160]  amendment you can't have an unlimited subpoena to to to wrap up millions of americans and
[1:14:17.160 --> 1:14:22.000]  say well who's talking to who about stop the seal republican activity and patriots now
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:26.880]  admits on twitter they're monitoring all conservatives and what sites we visit yeah this is getting
[1:14:26.880 --> 1:14:30.880]  dangerous it's very very dangerous i mean you gotta imagine who who's watching this
[1:14:30.880 --> 1:14:37.640]  interview right now the entire leftist industrial complex they get paid to monitor us and then
[1:14:37.640 --> 1:14:41.920]  this is what's crazy alex and again you know alex hasn't asked me what did you tell the
[1:14:41.920 --> 1:14:46.880]  committee what you guys are hearing live right here on info wars dot com is kind of my first
[1:14:46.880 --> 1:14:51.320]  characterization of what happened in that committee room but i was actually surprised
[1:14:51.320 --> 1:14:56.280]  by some of the left wing bluing on conspiracy theories that made it all the way up to the
[1:14:56.280 --> 1:15:00.480]  committee and they were like well blah blah blah blah blah and i'm like no that's obviously
[1:15:00.480 --> 1:15:02.800]  fake i'm famous for not doing this but i'm gonna give you the floor when i come back
[1:15:02.800 --> 1:15:07.680]  for the rest of the show if you want i want you to because exactly we do everything out
[1:15:07.680 --> 1:15:10.960]  in the light of day we didn't do something hidden we didn't scheme we haven't talked no
[1:15:10.960 --> 1:15:15.240]  prep with your producers or you or anybody just all the messages you told me this weekend
[1:15:15.240 --> 1:15:19.240]  i'm ready to come on yeah i said when you said tuesday at noon i said come on yeah that
[1:15:19.240 --> 1:15:23.360]  that's a hundred percent of the coordination and and yet they want to look they want a
[1:15:23.360 --> 1:15:29.240]  nexus is what my lawyers call it between the people who were violent unjustified violent
[1:15:29.240 --> 1:15:34.600]  or vandalism and then you and me and the activists so that they can connect it to a trump staffer
[1:15:34.600 --> 1:15:40.280]  and then trump folks trump will be subpoenaed by this committee breaking news trump will
[1:15:40.280 --> 1:15:44.440]  entirely be subpoenaed by this committee oh yeah i can tell you what they asked roger
[1:15:44.440 --> 1:15:48.760]  stone about me that ties to it they said that yeah it's scary and tell us about your secret
[1:15:48.760 --> 1:15:52.200]  meeting they said roger was the president planning all this with jones i didn't meet
[1:15:52.200 --> 1:15:55.960]  with the president they asked me that too were you in the oval office on this date and i
[1:15:55.960 --> 1:16:03.040]  said no we're gonna talk about it stay there so this could be literally your last chance
[1:16:03.040 --> 1:16:07.400]  with all the insane things happening in the world to get enforced products and to support

[1:17:12.280 --> 1:17:17.200]  order would have already basically won if it wasn't for info wars and I'm not bragging
[1:17:17.200 --> 1:17:21.760]  I'm letting you know that together as a family we have changed the world and that we have
[1:17:21.760 --> 1:17:27.320]  a responsibility because God put us in this position to not back down now at the very
[1:17:27.320 --> 1:17:31.920]  critical point this is an info war and the globalist are trying to break your will and
[1:17:31.920 --> 1:17:37.760]  demoralize you and I produced a two part course mind war spirit war six plus hours that lays
[1:17:37.760 --> 1:17:42.440]  out the most game changing information ever it's available right now at reset wars dot
[1:17:42.440 --> 1:17:48.320]  com and through Christmas day we've extended the sale 25 percent off so reset wars is now
[1:17:48.320 --> 1:17:54.600]  available at info wars store dot com and also reset wars dot com for 25 percent off thanks
[1:17:54.600 --> 1:18:00.960]  for getting the course and thanks for keeping info wars on the air reset wars dot com is
[1:18:00.960 --> 1:18:06.320]  the coordinates on the internet where you can find the most important information I produced
[1:18:06.320 --> 1:18:14.240]  in 28 years on air a lot of what's in the courses is known a lot isn't but it's my particular
[1:18:14.240 --> 1:18:19.320]  perspective in my definitions and my way of seeing the world doesn't mean it's perfectly
[1:18:19.320 --> 1:18:23.720]  right as the Bible says we all see through a rose color darkly but we've proven that
[1:18:23.720 --> 1:18:29.600]  we've got some of the clearest cutting edge discernment out there and I want you to have
[1:18:29.600 --> 1:18:35.000]  access to this information because you need these tools in my experience at least to stand
[1:18:35.000 --> 1:18:40.680]  for the globalist and not let them break your will and so through Christmas day the course
[1:18:40.680 --> 1:18:47.720]  is 25 percent off at reset wars dot com and it's not just an amazing game changing consciousness
[1:18:47.720 --> 1:18:53.560]  raising course it also funds the info war so it's a true 360 win reset wars dot com mind
[1:18:53.560 --> 1:19:00.440]  war spirit wars 25 percent off at reset wars dot com let's go ahead take another call let's
[1:19:00.440 --> 1:19:05.000]  talk to Malcolm in Tennessee welcome hello Alex yes Malcolm all right I will make this
[1:19:05.000 --> 1:19:09.960]  quick and real short where the other patrons can get online Alex I have to promote one
[1:19:09.960 --> 1:19:15.840]  thing from one of your co-host Owen shroyer super male volatility and brain force plus
[1:19:15.840 --> 1:19:20.520]  mix those two together you're an unstoppable tank super male volatility really really works
[1:19:20.520 --> 1:19:26.840]  it's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up and so it has
[1:19:26.840 --> 1:19:31.800]  a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well but just aren't as
[1:19:31.800 --> 1:19:36.560]  strong this is like a very fine wine it's it's it's in fact each batch is different sometimes
[1:19:36.560 --> 1:19:40.080]  it's super strong sometimes it's just okay people like why are you selling something and
[1:19:40.080 --> 1:19:45.080]  admitting sometimes the batch is in a strong that's just how it is it's how it works so
[1:19:45.080 --> 1:19:49.280]  it's always good it's just sometimes it's like super strong but yeah if you want the
[1:19:49.280 --> 1:20:03.120]  rolls Royce at a decent price then this is it leading a frontal assault on the lies of
[1:20:03.120 --> 1:20:24.880]  the new world order it's Alex Jones I want to be clear absolutely clear with listeners
[1:20:24.880 --> 1:20:30.600]  as I've told you they're using January 6 to turn the military and the CIA against the
[1:20:30.600 --> 1:20:36.760]  American people that's now all over the news and to steamroll all of our basic freedoms
[1:20:36.760 --> 1:20:41.160]  and our liberties they now admit it so general Flynn followed a suit against his day Ollie
[1:20:41.160 --> 1:20:46.560]  Alexander filed one a few days ago I filed one yesterday Roger Stone filed one last week
[1:20:46.560 --> 1:20:52.080]  people asked man these guys like to blow money no we're fighting for all of our rights and
[1:20:52.080 --> 1:20:56.840]  our liberties we're journalists they're demanding all our records all our everything to a political
[1:20:56.840 --> 1:21:02.840]  committee which will get to come up in a few minutes tied directly to the communist Chinese
[1:21:02.840 --> 1:21:07.240]  and as soon as this broke in the Gateway pundit a few days ago she's now basically resigning
[1:21:07.240 --> 1:21:11.240]  and not running for Congress again so Ollie Alexander you're on fire you got a ton to
[1:21:11.240 --> 1:21:14.960]  talk about I don't want to interrupt you because I heard from Roger that talked to you some
[1:21:14.960 --> 1:21:19.720]  of the crazy things that went on you also delivered to them evidence of the provocateurs
[1:21:19.720 --> 1:21:25.360]  on January 6 yeah this is going to be the first look inside the January 6 what would
[1:21:25.360 --> 1:21:28.640]  you call this committee and then you've got the floor well you know some people have called
[1:21:28.640 --> 1:21:36.720]  it the star chamber you know but it essentially is a committee to to weaken the Republican
[1:21:36.720 --> 1:21:42.040]  wave in 2022 which we shouldn't even characterize as a Republican wave it's an anti-democrat
[1:21:42.040 --> 1:21:48.200]  party wave an anti-communist Marxist wave an anti-mandatory vaccine wave but they're
[1:21:48.200 --> 1:21:54.160]  they're looking to weaken the Republican wave that's coming in 2022 but based off of everything
[1:21:54.160 --> 1:21:59.680]  I heard in that committee this is to stop Trump from even having the option of running
[1:21:59.680 --> 1:22:04.400]  in 2024 look I don't know who I'm going to support in 2024 but I'll tell you what this
[1:22:04.400 --> 1:22:10.400]  committee is hell bent on taking out you taking out me taking out Roger taking out a whole
[1:22:10.400 --> 1:22:15.960]  whore host of normie Trump staffers the ones that were willing to you know put up the stage
[1:22:15.960 --> 1:22:20.800]  and the sound equipment for the ellipse event entirely a peaceful event and they're like
[1:22:20.800 --> 1:22:23.840]  we don't want this guy to run again and we're going to railroad these people and put them
[1:22:23.840 --> 1:22:27.480]  in jail so you know my prediction is very sad my prediction is that you're going to
[1:22:27.480 --> 1:22:32.400]  see two to three people at minimum go to jail you're going to they're going to want to perp
[1:22:32.400 --> 1:22:36.720]  walk Donald Trump I don't think that they'll go that far but they will subpoena a former
[1:22:36.720 --> 1:22:42.040]  president of the United States they've already eliminated executive privilege they've already
[1:22:42.040 --> 1:22:47.480]  eliminated that and a lot of people can have a separation of powers for 250 years gone
[1:22:47.480 --> 1:22:52.200]  gone and and you know I as one lawyer I forgot who it was put it put it put it like this
[1:22:52.200 --> 1:22:59.480]  is that if executive privilege does not apply post office then the chilling effect is that
[1:22:59.480 --> 1:23:05.120]  during office you won't use it right so so they've totally eliminated that in your journalist
[1:23:05.120 --> 1:23:10.240]  Tucker Carlson nailed it your journalist any work that you and I did together look you
[1:23:10.240 --> 1:23:13.960]  did your speeches I did my speeches you know we kind of coordinated on logistics a little
[1:23:13.960 --> 1:23:19.400]  bit security a little bit but you did journalism while I was organizing and then after we left
[1:23:19.400 --> 1:23:23.080]  the Capitol you know I booked a person on your show or something like that but to go
[1:23:23.080 --> 1:23:28.200]  after journalist because they're conservative is absolutely abhorrent the committee is
[1:23:28.200 --> 1:23:33.640]  so wide-ranging it's it's an absolute purge they are they're asking an independent photo
[1:23:33.640 --> 1:23:38.840]  journalist who isn't even right wing for her her photographs of the proud boy so it's entirely
[1:23:38.840 --> 1:23:43.240]  insane and when I was in there I was just surprised it was like dealing with left wing Twitter
[1:23:43.240 --> 1:23:48.360]  I was like no I wasn't in the Oval Office no I didn't call into the Oval Office Trump isn't
[1:23:48.360 --> 1:23:52.400]  paying me secretly on the side in some bank account what are you talking about described
[1:23:52.400 --> 1:23:57.320]  as Roger described going under these giant TVs they're not in there but Schiff and Cheney
[1:23:57.320 --> 1:24:02.440]  they're all these big TVs yeah science fiction movie and then like what what Roger said you
[1:24:02.440 --> 1:24:07.360]  told him is you're like no I didn't plan an attack no one did that I knew so you're admitting
[1:24:07.360 --> 1:24:10.920]  you attacked the capital I mean yes so look well to take your time we got plenty of time
[1:24:10.920 --> 1:24:15.000]  yeah it's it's it's you know it's a little bit exciting one you know it's my buddy and
[1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:19.800]  I'm here for the first time you know able to talk with him this is insane though I'm
[1:24:19.800 --> 1:24:23.640]  gonna be in Mordor soon they're summoning me there yeah yeah you're going to be in this
[1:24:23.640 --> 1:24:27.880]  room I'm gonna hear about this yeah so you walk in and it's like this u-shape room there's
[1:24:27.880 --> 1:24:32.280]  no committee members okay and so what you'll notice first is that we're in a propaganda
[1:24:32.280 --> 1:24:37.440]  war we're in an info war because a hundred percent of what you see in media you see a
[1:24:37.440 --> 1:24:42.240]  photograph from the only public hearing that they've ever had they've had one public hearing
[1:24:42.240 --> 1:24:45.720]  and that that's when the members showed up I'm gonna get in so much trouble for saying
[1:24:45.720 --> 1:24:51.800]  this but I go in there and it's this u-shape desk there's four lawyers each with a different
[1:24:51.800 --> 1:24:57.720]  specialty I mean sharks killers I really respect their intellect they were only blinded by hate
[1:24:57.720 --> 1:25:02.680]  they got to the ten yard line sometimes with me and then they were just that shit crazy
[1:25:02.680 --> 1:25:07.320]  and then I'm sitting on the other side with my lawyers we start pot we start taking out
[1:25:07.320 --> 1:25:11.880]  binders full of evidence that we've provided them and including antifa evidence and they
[1:25:11.880 --> 1:25:18.040]  start laughing at us I mean minute one it was hostile then they say we already have your
[1:25:18.040 --> 1:25:22.080]  opening statement we saw that it made the New York Times I said well that's not my opening
[1:25:22.080 --> 1:25:26.840]  statement because I just got mine an hour ago so it was it was completely hostile and
[1:25:26.840 --> 1:25:30.800]  then boom boom boom boom boom and Alex what you just said is absolutely true so I did
[1:25:30.800 --> 1:25:35.720]  debate I was a champion debater you know beat 5,000 people in the country my senior year
[1:25:35.720 --> 1:25:39.200]  did student congress mock trial did the whole you know youth and government program and
[1:25:39.200 --> 1:25:45.520]  YMCA and and then you know I've trained candidates in debate so but I got to say if I didn't
[1:25:45.520 --> 1:25:49.560]  I would have pled the fifth because what they would do is ask you a question you give them
[1:25:49.560 --> 1:25:55.960]  an answer they would say whatever they wanted to say and then say right and they were testing
[1:25:55.960 --> 1:26:00.440]  your verbal IQ they were testing your memory because if you repeat the wrong answer to
[1:26:00.440 --> 1:26:07.360]  them that's perjury and so as they fast talk you and you're done yeah and so eight hours
[1:26:07.360 --> 1:26:12.440]  no meals you can't eat okay they got a little snack bar that you can buy expensive stuff
[1:26:12.440 --> 1:26:17.800]  I beef jerky a little thing of cheese and some apple juice but they ran me down and
[1:26:17.800 --> 1:26:23.280]  down and down they put the press in the room to harass me so you got daily beast filming
[1:26:23.280 --> 1:26:28.080]  me going to the bathroom and then post on Twitter all these lawyer forgot to zip up
[1:26:28.080 --> 1:26:35.520]  a zipper I mean it was it was a circus and I said Alex Jones myself Roger Stone have
[1:26:35.520 --> 1:26:41.720]  all supported any independent investigation into January 6th any because we do want to
[1:26:41.720 --> 1:26:45.520]  get to the truth of the matter there's some weird stuff that went on both with government
[1:26:45.520 --> 1:26:50.240]  with left wing and yes some right wing stupid people who did some stupid silly things I
[1:26:50.240 --> 1:26:53.920]  don't know if there was malicious there was some definite boneheads yeah there's a bonehead
[1:26:53.920 --> 1:26:58.880]  and so the Senate multiple committees in the Senate have investigated January 6th multiple
[1:26:58.880 --> 1:27:03.520]  committees in the House have investigated January 6th this select committee or unselect committee
[1:27:03.520 --> 1:27:09.200]  is not the only one investigating it you and I have been targets of the FBI the DHS the
[1:27:09.200 --> 1:27:14.280]  DOJ and all kinds of other things and and I don't even again they want to frame America
[1:27:14.280 --> 1:27:19.120]  and frame us for a premeditated attack with Trump to literally suspend elections and declare
[1:27:19.120 --> 1:27:22.680]  martial law for those that don't know they're all over the news saying generals want troops
[1:27:22.680 --> 1:27:28.240]  on the streets to stop martial law no no that's martial law yeah is it that is it that ironic
[1:27:28.240 --> 1:27:31.920]  I mean they're entirely projecting on to us what we want and it's like you know I mean
[1:27:31.920 --> 1:27:36.880]  at one at one point it was like well why did you and Alex or the Capitol we had an event
[1:27:36.880 --> 1:27:42.800]  to speak to well why did you engage the crowd to pull innocent bystanders away from the
[1:27:42.800 --> 1:27:47.800]  tear gas away from the side don't go in the capital yeah I mean and I'm like I said you
[1:27:47.800 --> 1:27:51.920]  know what Alex did he was a hero and they're like you know I mean they asked me some other
[1:27:51.920 --> 1:27:55.120]  question I don't know if I should go into it maybe I will but but you know they asked
[1:27:55.120 --> 1:27:58.200]  me some other questions like to speculate and I gotta tell you when you're before these
[1:27:58.200 --> 1:28:02.960]  people I don't need to speculate Alex's words don't speculate yeah you know I'm like well
[1:28:02.960 --> 1:28:08.920]  why didn't you correct Alex I said I had tear gas in my eye you know you know your cops
[1:28:08.920 --> 1:28:13.840]  shot me with tear gas and I wasn't even in an unpermitted zone you know so it was just
[1:28:13.840 --> 1:28:18.360]  it was a wild melee go to the permanent zone yeah and so as we're doing and we're cooperating
[1:28:18.360 --> 1:28:24.200]  with that's what they hate I'm telling you God's favor was on us we had your crew your
[1:28:24.200 --> 1:28:29.440]  security bubble which guided me you and Owen and we were subject to that security bubble
[1:28:29.440 --> 1:28:34.440]  okay and then we had the camera crew if a hundred percent of our actions and really
[1:28:34.440 --> 1:28:38.480]  the only thing I think we've ever coordinated on is one of the first and only conversations
[1:28:38.480 --> 1:28:42.880]  we had after January 6th is we got to get a lot of that footage out there so that people
[1:28:42.880 --> 1:28:48.600]  don't accuse me and you of having done something and it exonerates us it entirely exonerates
[1:28:48.600 --> 1:28:53.440]  and before we got the footage out the Wall Street Journal said Jones cowardly ordered
[1:28:53.440 --> 1:29:00.960]  the attack and out of range of rubber bullets yeah yeah I had to retract that yeah this
[1:29:00.960 --> 1:29:06.760]  could be in full wars last Christmas because it could be America's last Christmas evil
[1:29:06.760 --> 1:29:11.280]  is taking over the planet they're destroying our borders our sovereignty our supply chains
[1:29:11.280 --> 1:29:16.280]  our language our currencies they're coming after us and if we don't support American

[1:33:48.600 --> 1:33:54.920]  in incredible behavior what about told you a committee member was directly involved in
[1:33:54.920 --> 1:34:00.480]  the assault on the capital and funding it and directing it yes that's breaking tomorrow
[1:34:00.480 --> 1:34:07.400]  we're still on air then ali alexander you are on fire my friend you filed a suit against
[1:34:07.400 --> 1:34:11.720]  them so a general friend so have i so roger we're fighting back for our rights for all
[1:34:11.720 --> 1:34:18.120]  americans rights you we shot a minute and a half video during the break that was you were
[1:34:18.120 --> 1:34:23.200]  really explaining you you really codified what's happening and and how they're brand new america
[1:34:23.200 --> 1:34:27.480]  people's terrorist and and and what this committee is really about please repeat that you know
[1:34:27.480 --> 1:34:34.120]  a lot of look you know i don't know if i should say this but but a couple months ago i was
[1:34:34.120 --> 1:34:39.440]  like okay cool a committee okay no republicans are going to participate in it whatever you
[1:34:39.440 --> 1:34:45.560]  know i'll cooperate if i'm asked to and i was the third i've been the only person subpoenaed
[1:34:45.560 --> 1:34:50.440]  on their own day i'm the only person before this entire committee who's like okay stop
[1:34:50.440 --> 1:34:53.960]  the steel has its own day everybody else was glopped together with groups of people that
[1:34:53.960 --> 1:34:57.680]  they're trying to associate with and i said okay well i'm i'm i'm willing to cooperate
[1:34:57.680 --> 1:35:03.000]  whatever and out of the gate they didn't ask me for voluntary testimony they didn't ask
[1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:09.400]  me for evidence they just were like here are two or here are here are three subpoenas so
[1:35:09.400 --> 1:35:13.960]  i'm also the only individual that i know who has three subpoenas okay so they subpoena
[1:35:13.960 --> 1:35:19.000]  me and my personal capacity documents in my personal capacity then stop the steel documents
[1:35:19.000 --> 1:35:23.040]  i haven't announced this yet but i have three as well okay well like you know we're gonna
[1:35:23.040 --> 1:35:30.880]  have a dick measuring contest in this uh no and so the well that makes sense and see you
[1:35:30.880 --> 1:35:35.400]  know what people need to know is that if alex has three and they're targeting his personal
[1:35:35.400 --> 1:35:42.840]  capacity in his media agency where's the aclu we're seeing in where's abc and cbs but what
[1:35:42.840 --> 1:35:48.200]  this is really about is i've i've i've called some publishers and i said this is a full
[1:35:48.200 --> 1:35:54.320]  assault on 2022 why is biden and bolden with these mandates why is the governor of new
[1:35:54.320 --> 1:35:59.520]  york and the governor of california okay with basically spreading the virus because
[1:35:59.520 --> 1:36:05.840]  this is their backup plan they aren't going to just run on january 6 in the midterms they
[1:36:05.840 --> 1:36:10.120]  are seeking to take us out so we can't even run against them on the narrative which is
[1:36:10.120 --> 1:36:14.200]  how they've effectively lynched me online they have this video where like ali refused to
[1:36:14.200 --> 1:36:17.920]  denounce violence i never refused to denounce violence they also show us in georgia months
[1:36:17.920 --> 1:36:22.760]  before planning that's us in a capital yeah breaking news ali is going to sue and you
[1:36:22.760 --> 1:36:28.240]  might have to bleep me i'm going to sue that ginger ass kathy griffin for alleging that
[1:36:28.240 --> 1:36:35.360]  me and alex jones were uh plotting to to storm the capital and the georgia state capital
[1:36:35.360 --> 1:36:40.200]  you don't have to censor ginger ass okay yeah well i didn't know if ass was was appropriate
[1:36:40.200 --> 1:36:45.200]  or not but but you know there's a lot of people took my silence as oh i'll leave secretly
[1:36:45.200 --> 1:36:51.040]  working with the democrats or oh i'll leave a coward i was under threat i had to get my
[1:36:51.040 --> 1:36:56.080]  legal situation all your media taken away yeah all of it and i could not combat the tidal
[1:36:56.080 --> 1:36:59.760]  wave maybe i should have been coming on in fours but you know what i had to do was build
[1:36:59.760 --> 1:37:04.360]  this this legal team and i'm going to go broke next year i'll be bankrupt i'll be just like
[1:37:04.360 --> 1:37:10.600]  roger stone but guess what that's okay because i'm going to launch a jericho missile of defamation
[1:37:10.600 --> 1:37:14.840]  suits i'm gonna launch i'm suing the committee uh i got some other lawsuits that i'm about
[1:37:14.840 --> 1:37:19.760]  to announce there are some conspiracy some left wing conspiracy theories about me you
[1:37:19.760 --> 1:37:24.880]  nick fuentes and and roger stone i'm suing that asshole in florida so january is going
[1:37:24.880 --> 1:37:28.920]  to be a big month for me you know i'm not accepting money going down without a fight i'm not going
[1:37:28.920 --> 1:37:33.880]  down without a fight we did nothing wrong in fact alex i'm gonna say this we save lives
[1:37:33.880 --> 1:37:37.640]  you and i save lives and my lawyers and we're not trying to say we're heroes but we did
[1:37:37.640 --> 1:37:41.720]  our job my lawyers sat there with their thumbs up their rear ends we actually try to stop
[1:37:41.720 --> 1:37:47.040]  it right if the cops want to sue me how about i sue them for violating my civil rights not
[1:37:47.040 --> 1:37:51.200]  only did they not have the barricades not only did they not provide protection for lot
[1:37:51.200 --> 1:37:57.120]  eight permit they didn't issue a disbursement order so we were doing the job of disburse
[1:37:57.120 --> 1:38:02.200]  now the order i'm like get on your i know you've got yep pa systems you said get on
[1:38:02.200 --> 1:38:06.920]  them you leave now leave now no one did that we've been armored vehicle which they had
[1:38:06.920 --> 1:38:11.000]  a bunch couldn't everybody leave yep and and one these are right wingers they do what
[1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:16.360]  the police say yeah and what was very strange about it was that there was music playing
[1:38:16.360 --> 1:38:20.200]  i'll never forget once we got permission to go out did that to blur us as soon as we
[1:38:20.200 --> 1:38:24.800]  got permission they went where turn the music on this was military it was it was i think
[1:38:24.800 --> 1:38:29.560]  there's a gentleman uh uh well now i'm forgetting the name but anyway hey start over we got
[1:38:29.560 --> 1:38:33.720]  we were into the whole next hour just just all else here earlier i shot a video about
[1:38:33.720 --> 1:38:38.840]  what really happened january 16 this is about 2022 alex this is about 2022 this this is the
[1:38:38.840 --> 1:38:42.280]  a game tell them right now okay so you know i've done campaigns and super fact i'm not
[1:38:42.280 --> 1:38:46.200]  like some random political activists you know i've had 15 years in this industry what this
[1:38:46.200 --> 1:38:52.040]  looks like to me is to be a frame up job they want the referendum in 2022 to not be about
[1:38:52.040 --> 1:38:58.120]  co vid not to be about the mandatory vaccines but instead to say this violent rhetoric is
[1:38:58.120 --> 1:39:02.840]  mainstream the republican party kevin mccarthy and trump are endorsing it and who do they have
[1:39:03.960 --> 1:39:08.600]  side helping them now mitch mcconnell this is a coup this is a coup against the first
[1:39:08.600 --> 1:39:12.360]  amendment there should be no right wing media this is a coup against the fourth amendment
[1:39:12.360 --> 1:39:16.760]  there should be no private communications between right wing activists and this is fundamentally
[1:39:16.760 --> 1:39:19.720]  a coup against the fifth amendment where you and roger are going to plead the fifth and
[1:39:19.720 --> 1:39:23.720]  that's your constitutional right and they're still going to try to indict you and so and i
[1:39:23.720 --> 1:39:27.400]  don't think that they'll be successful at that at all but this is a coup and so then
[1:39:27.400 --> 1:39:32.120]  they have these generals come out and say well these guys actually want an insurrection when
[1:39:32.120 --> 1:39:35.960]  they're the ones proposing it they're the ones proposing martial law they're the ones who
[1:39:35.960 --> 1:39:40.200]  want an insurrection against the first amendment and political activity and seeking redress
[1:39:40.200 --> 1:39:44.760]  i'm talking really fast but i'm just i'm so shocked that they're just jamming it's like
[1:39:44.760 --> 1:39:49.560]  we're watching the sausage be made and they're like look we've demoralized alex we've demoralized
[1:39:49.560 --> 1:39:54.600]  ali we've demoralized roger not so much those two i was depressed for eight months and then they
[1:39:54.600 --> 1:39:58.520]  said but these guys aren't talking and so we're coming out of the woodwork as patriots and arch
[1:39:58.520 --> 1:40:04.040]  bishop vegano said and said there's a super group of patriots and believers that are going to take
[1:40:04.040 --> 1:40:08.360]  on the deep state anti-globalist alliance yep the deep state and the deep church he wrote i'm proud
[1:40:08.360 --> 1:40:12.520]  to be in that with you yeah exactly yeah and so i'm not giving up so we look say that again deep
[1:40:12.520 --> 1:40:16.680]  state deep church it's the deep state and the deep church arch bishop vegano actually spoke
[1:40:16.680 --> 1:40:22.040]  at our jericho rally that that we had in december december he's amazing everything he writes is
[1:40:22.040 --> 1:40:26.760]  true yeah he should be pope but look he's in exile and hiding because this jesuit pope doesn't
[1:40:26.760 --> 1:40:31.240]  like the catholic hersey with him as pope yeah and you know and i'm i'm so proud that he has
[1:40:31.240 --> 1:40:35.800]  supported our movement he supported he says it's all dead on it's he says this is a battle plan
[1:40:35.800 --> 1:40:40.200]  it's a takeover you gotta wake up you gotta take action whether it's banking or the fortune 500
[1:40:40.200 --> 1:40:46.760]  companies or it's media or it's it's politics or it's the church there's a group of powerful people
[1:40:46.760 --> 1:40:51.400]  who have infiltrated all good institutions that's why they infiltrate them we've talked about this
[1:40:51.400 --> 1:40:56.120]  before the great inversion is what i've called it dr taylor marshal calls it an infiltration
[1:40:56.120 --> 1:41:01.560]  but what evil seeks to do is what what what what the devil did to eve okay what the devil did to
[1:41:01.560 --> 1:41:07.480]  job what you know the devil did with all those other you know um archangels you know it's like
[1:41:07.480 --> 1:41:12.920]  hey we can do this better and they can't and so the jesuits have actually done this inside
[1:41:12.920 --> 1:41:16.680]  of of the catholic church and you know a lot of evangelicals they hate the whole catholic church
[1:41:16.680 --> 1:41:20.760]  but they need to realize that there must be something good about that sacrament that evil
[1:41:20.760 --> 1:41:27.240]  wants to infiltrate it in the same that trump is surrounded by all these serpents that ill
[1:41:27.240 --> 1:41:32.360]  advise him what is it what is there good about trump that evil seeks to corrupt him and you
[1:41:32.360 --> 1:41:38.600]  and i have had our fair share of people trying to scyop us and so look 2022 it's not 2024 it's
[1:41:38.600 --> 1:41:44.200]  2022 generals are saying 2024 no no no it's only about trump no it's now they want to block the
[1:41:44.200 --> 1:41:49.880]  will of people yeah they want mail-in ballots unlimited universal they want drop-off boxes

[1:41:54.840 --> 1:42:00.040]  where's the rnc so imagine this we're all under martial law we're all told that you know there's

[1:42:20.280 --> 1:42:25.400]  campaign whether trump desantis or anybody else no that's it they know we're waking up they know
[1:42:25.400 --> 1:42:31.080]  we're waking up and saying no they're making their move now this is the wrap-up smear to free elections
[1:42:31.080 --> 1:42:35.720]  there are no free elections if they get away with this in 2022 they're making it illegal to question
[1:42:35.720 --> 1:42:39.160]  elections they're saying we're not worried about it radical islam we're not worried about china
[1:42:39.160 --> 1:42:43.480]  we're worried about people questioning elections and if you do it the green berets are coming

[1:45:13.160 --> 1:45:18.520]  have spent a lifetime in the sun like me i was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're
[1:45:18.520 --> 1:45:24.440]  lovingly called but since taking your x2 for the last couple of years my skin is just really
[1:45:24.440 --> 1:45:31.160]  gorgeous actually people think i'm 55 years old and i was already taking your other supplements
[1:45:31.160 --> 1:45:35.800]  but i thought you know well maybe that's what i need to do because i just thought it was a hopeless
[1:45:35.800 --> 1:45:41.400]  situation but when i started taking it i mean it doesn't happen immediately but you know over a period
[1:45:41.400 --> 1:45:47.320]  of time i started noticing okay you know this is the ticket this is working this is wonderful you
[1:45:47.320 --> 1:45:53.960]  know i don't i don't have to put on derma blend anymore you know so anyway it worked wonderfully
[1:45:53.960 --> 1:46:01.240]  and it really has totally cleared up my skin i've been fighting as hard as i can for almost 28 years
[1:46:01.800 --> 1:46:07.320]  against the globalist i wanted to stop their agenda i wanted to wake up the world and stop
[1:46:07.320 --> 1:46:12.440]  them dead in their tracks before they went operational but we failed yes a lot of people are
[1:46:12.440 --> 1:46:18.760]  awake yes we're not getting caught flat footed but they are going ahead with their full operational
[1:46:18.760 --> 1:46:23.800]  deindustrialization great reset and that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers
[1:46:23.800 --> 1:46:28.600]  and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and
[1:46:28.600 --> 1:46:33.160]  ready to hear the truth so we've got an information warfare of the enemy and try to stop their agenda
[1:46:33.160 --> 1:46:37.160]  we've also got to get personally prepared and one of the number one things to do is high quality

[1:46:57.560 --> 1:47:06.360]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones
[1:47:27.560 --> 1:47:36.360]  you were always on my mind
[1:47:47.560 --> 1:47:48.920]  you were always on my mind
[1:47:48.920 --> 1:47:57.240]  well trump says he's doing a press conference at 230 central today we'll be covering it live
[1:47:57.800 --> 1:48:04.040]  here on air ollie alexander is a political activist a pro-american populist i was there
[1:48:04.040 --> 1:48:10.360]  with him i saw we wanted to have a peaceful rally he had a permit uh before trump even began speaking
[1:48:10.360 --> 1:48:14.680]  there were groups attacking police we didn't know that we were there right we got told by the secret
[1:48:14.680 --> 1:48:19.080]  service go there and you talk about that we're not claiming the secret service did this on purpose
[1:48:19.080 --> 1:48:23.960]  but we are asking the question why did they call roger at his hotel and say come lead it why did
[1:48:23.960 --> 1:48:29.240]  they tell us come lead it and they opened up the gate and had us lead it were they being told by
[1:48:29.240 --> 1:48:34.440]  somebody that there was a setup because you make that point tucker carlson's documentary yeah i mean
[1:48:34.440 --> 1:48:41.000]  look you know whether it was and we know that this is also a spiritual war and so actually let me
[1:48:41.000 --> 1:48:47.160]  preface this with this with the biden administration wants and i say this with all due respect
[1:48:47.160 --> 1:48:54.680]  and i know that there are some patriots inside of the fbi but with the top people at the fbi want
[1:48:54.680 --> 1:49:00.280]  with the political appointees wanting the biden administration is us to be fearful to associate
[1:49:00.280 --> 1:49:05.160]  with one another and when you think about this isn't this the same thing that they want in the
[1:49:05.160 --> 1:49:12.840]  corona virus panic they don't want people to have mass together have church together and so in a lot
[1:49:12.840 --> 1:49:18.040]  of ways what people need to you know and this is a very sore subject because there's a lot of people
[1:49:18.040 --> 1:49:23.960]  hurting and and when you out this information to the public the left loves it but what a lot of
[1:49:23.960 --> 1:49:30.280]  people need to know is that a lot of us organizers have not talked in a year people that i went from
[1:49:30.280 --> 1:49:35.720]  talking to every hour i haven't talked to in a in a year and there's a lot of despair it's a
[1:49:35.720 --> 1:49:41.560]  spiritual attack so what i want to say is that as i tell this story with alex and roger is
[1:49:42.200 --> 1:49:49.240]  we don't know if someone did it or something did it but alex and i were escorted out of the perimeter
[1:49:49.240 --> 1:49:54.200]  in such a time that had we not stopped at the restroom had we not regrouped with staff and the
[1:49:54.200 --> 1:50:00.200]  security team because we need to remain safe and have we not stopped at freedom plaza alex jones
[1:50:00.200 --> 1:50:05.640]  and ollie alexander would have been there when rey epps and the other agitators i believe in my
[1:50:05.640 --> 1:50:15.080]  opinion coordinate those first punches and had alex and i arrived there without camera men
[1:50:16.360 --> 1:50:23.640]  alex jones would be in jail without bail right now ollie alexander would be in jail without bail
[1:50:23.640 --> 1:50:31.080]  right now and that's not an exaggeration i know from witnesses that as soon as trump began speaking
[1:50:31.080 --> 1:50:35.480]  they that they got on their radio said attack attack and then as soon as we started march they went
[1:50:35.480 --> 1:50:40.040]  okay prepare and they were waiting at a certain point it was all precision done and i'm about to
[1:50:40.040 --> 1:50:44.760]  break news on alex's air here in a couple minutes we're going to actually show a gentleman with an
[1:50:44.760 --> 1:50:50.200]  earpiece who was on the east side prior to alex and i getting there and they stormed the east
[1:50:50.200 --> 1:50:55.000]  and we found the earpiece in his ear folks we found the earpiece in his ear and you gave this to this
[1:50:55.000 --> 1:51:00.600]  committee i gave this to the committee side we we could but but let me say this is so it is strange
[1:51:00.600 --> 1:51:05.640]  you know roger commented on this and i thought this might be lost on a lot of people well as roger
[1:51:05.640 --> 1:51:09.800]  was going to kind of still go to the capital till the secret service call he thought secret services
[1:51:09.800 --> 1:51:14.280]  that escort people around no and you have to understand this roger has done a lot of political
[1:51:14.280 --> 1:51:19.000]  campaigns and i've done a lot of political campaigns we've been around around a lot of republican
[1:51:19.000 --> 1:51:24.920]  nominees and then presidents you have to understand every office that's independent can become a
[1:51:24.920 --> 1:51:29.400]  little political the fbi can become a little political the doj can become a little political
[1:51:29.400 --> 1:51:34.440]  the only institution in all of america that does not become political is secret service
[1:51:34.440 --> 1:51:39.880]  in so much as when president trump was president elect and he came to louisiana and i was vip there
[1:51:39.880 --> 1:51:45.400]  and oh my gosh collusion that he tried to hand secret services code and they refused to grab it
[1:51:45.400 --> 1:51:50.200]  when he was president elect and this is his detail that he'd had since he was the nominee
[1:51:50.200 --> 1:51:55.480]  and so he'd won the election rightfully so you know how about an election denier hillary clinton but
[1:51:55.480 --> 1:51:59.240]  but look at this they wouldn't even hand it's go so you have to understand when roger stone says
[1:51:59.240 --> 1:52:05.880]  that secret service does not do political chores we're not talking colloquially we're talking this
[1:52:05.880 --> 1:52:11.560]  has been a policy of the secret service absent of like letting jfk's because i was hearing this from
[1:52:11.560 --> 1:52:15.720]  the organizers and people that i saw walking on the stage with trump i'm like really i'm going to
[1:52:15.720 --> 1:52:19.560]  lead the march and then they open the gate the secret service weighs me through yeah before i'm
[1:52:19.560 --> 1:52:26.760]  like okay man and again it might not be who's the judas well i don't know well well you know i i do
[1:52:26.760 --> 1:52:34.200]  know this had alex jones spoke had a lee alexander spoke had scott pressler spoke had brandon schraca
[1:52:34.200 --> 1:52:41.000]  spoke cj pierce and spoke roger stone spoke we were all going to mention lot eight lot eight lot eight
[1:52:42.120 --> 1:52:48.200]  we know and i'm just going to say this that the women for america first in coordination with
[1:52:48.200 --> 1:52:55.160]  with trump advisor katrina pierce and with this cheney about to come out tomorrow well he is that
[1:52:55.160 --> 1:53:00.200]  there's going to be some effort there's a con folks there's comes a connection between the permit
[1:53:00.200 --> 1:53:04.840]  holders of the ellipse and liz cheney and i hope alex breaks that part of the story tomorrow we're
[1:53:04.840 --> 1:53:07.800]  going to break it oh yeah it's going to be big folks so what you have to understand is look and
[1:53:07.800 --> 1:53:11.160]  then who's running to the committee saying subpoena my information subpoena my information
[1:53:11.720 --> 1:53:17.080]  the all the consultants for women for america first so the trump advisor cheney right and so
[1:53:17.080 --> 1:53:21.720]  the truth so i'm not you know again a couple of trump advisors not all of them but a couple
[1:53:22.440 --> 1:53:27.160]  served trump and said you don't want to be associated with with stop the steel you don't
[1:53:27.160 --> 1:53:33.320]  want to be associated with people you've endorsed you want to be associated with these pigs you
[1:53:33.320 --> 1:53:36.680]  know and i'm talking about their size i'm not you know they're not in law enforcement or anything
[1:53:36.680 --> 1:53:42.600]  and and those people sabotage the rally so look i look i think the ad i think that and i don't want
[1:53:42.600 --> 1:53:46.520]  to i don't want to suggest that they're responsible for the daughter of this famous work war criminal
[1:53:47.240 --> 1:53:51.400]  this literally we now know we know we have the permits we know
[1:53:51.400 --> 1:53:57.560]  lit the whole bracket tomorrow yeah yeah cheney ran the attack on the capital oh sorry yeah oh
[1:53:57.560 --> 1:54:02.760]  i'm sorry and here's another thing that we've raised she plays up both she is and she's on the
[1:54:02.760 --> 1:54:08.760]  committee gas sliding 101 she i can't believe it it's it's weird you got the permits as well
[1:54:08.760 --> 1:54:13.320]  and we've so like let's have that let's have the team bring up some of the agitators these are
[1:54:13.320 --> 1:54:17.960]  exclusive photos that we're about to show you of agitators i mean dick cheney's daughter of course
[1:54:17.960 --> 1:54:24.440]  the freaking turd of satan look at this she's born out of cheney's so i want to show the pictures
[1:54:24.440 --> 1:54:30.040]  of the ginger exclusive stuff tell people what this is okay so peter duke is a photographer
[1:54:30.040 --> 1:54:35.560]  out of los angeles he's an amazing photographer amazing photographer we employed his services at
[1:54:35.560 --> 1:54:43.000]  stop the steel now peter again it was so disorganized that peter actually left the ellipse prior to you
[1:54:43.000 --> 1:54:50.440]  and me so he again by god's grace stumbles on to the east side near the capital and he's like
[1:54:50.440 --> 1:54:57.160]  what's going on here peter watched the whole thing he caught people breaking the barricades
[1:54:57.160 --> 1:55:01.720]  people bird dogging the police he caught the groups of people that were working together
[1:55:01.720 --> 1:55:08.600]  and they caught these two gentlemen on top of the armored car who flagged the crowd into storming
[1:55:08.600 --> 1:55:15.320]  the capital on the east side breaking news the east side agitators okay so this gentleman grabbing
[1:55:15.320 --> 1:55:19.720]  it is ends up working with another gentleman to distract the police while they take apart the
[1:55:19.720 --> 1:55:25.880]  barricades again i didn't find this out until late january and peter's like i got some photographs
[1:55:25.880 --> 1:55:29.640]  i'm like i don't have time for photographs i'm being hunted by antifa i'm in the mountains
[1:55:29.640 --> 1:55:34.680]  of colorado right now and he's like no you need to see these photos and i said oh my god i get on
[1:55:34.680 --> 1:55:39.880]  the phone with my lawyer i said hand this over to the fbi right now alex none of these people have
[1:55:39.880 --> 1:55:45.080]  been arrested none of these people have appeared on the fbi website college professors and democrats
[1:55:45.080 --> 1:55:50.200]  yeah and you know or whatever like when we again let's go back to the guys on the armored cars
[1:55:50.200 --> 1:55:56.120]  in particular this gentleman who's a malano gentleman wearing a desert scarf and the and
[1:55:56.120 --> 1:56:00.760]  the uh the ginger beard okay and i i want to walk you through okay so these two gentlemen
[1:56:00.760 --> 1:56:06.840]  these two gentlemen do not skip leg day okay they do not skip leg day they are wearing
[1:56:06.840 --> 1:56:11.160]  these knuckled gloves they have backpacks meaning they never came to the ellipse rally
[1:56:11.160 --> 1:56:15.080]  they never had any intention of going to our lot eight peaceful rally which never occurred
[1:56:15.720 --> 1:56:22.360]  this flag that he has it's a mega flag sure it's the only one in the crowd i've had people review
[1:56:22.360 --> 1:56:28.760]  10 000 photos this is the only flag this is clearly what i believe to be a signal now we're
[1:56:28.760 --> 1:56:32.920]  going to keep going through these photos i'm going to tell you this and tifa employs a tactic
[1:56:32.920 --> 1:56:37.640]  called black block you're familiar with that okay they always have someone called you know they have

[1:59:06.280 --> 1:59:11.000]  way of seeing the world doesn't mean it's perfectly right as the bible says we all see through a rose

[2:00:17.320 --> 2:00:23.640]  stations but ollie let's get into you decided because the lawyers are all saying let's not
[2:00:23.640 --> 2:00:27.320]  talk to each other but we've done nothing wrong yeah and you had the courage to go and actually
[2:00:27.320 --> 2:00:31.400]  talk to the committee i know they're a group of criminals so i would refuse to do it oh you're
[2:00:31.400 --> 2:00:36.760]  scared to do it i mean they'll twist anything you say so what has this process been like for you
[2:00:36.760 --> 2:00:44.600]  you um i haven't worked all year you know and you know it's kind of hard to decide how how
[2:00:44.600 --> 2:00:47.960]  personal i was going to get with this but i had a conversation i'm the same thing i mean i'm
[2:00:47.960 --> 2:00:51.960]  spending all my money i'll be bankrupt next year too but it's like christlike it feels really
[2:00:51.960 --> 2:00:56.520]  no way it does it does putting everything in you're like a hundred percent yeah four weeks ago
[2:00:57.240 --> 2:01:03.480]  i finally realized i can't afford all of these bills at the at the rate that i'm spending
[2:01:03.480 --> 2:01:10.920]  and but i was like if i don't do this in a different way then we will never know so like
[2:01:10.920 --> 2:01:15.240]  meadows is doing it his way bannon's doing it his way you and roger are doing it your way
[2:01:15.240 --> 2:01:19.320]  i was like i have to carve out my own lane so that we know that everything we could protect
[2:01:19.320 --> 2:01:24.280]  freedom and that if one of us gets the blueprint it can apply to the left wing and the right wing
[2:01:24.280 --> 2:01:30.040]  for freedom and but we've got to be faithful we got to be faithful you know you you're we are
[2:01:30.040 --> 2:01:34.520]  commanded to finish the race okay that's the only way you know that you have the holy spirit inside
[2:01:34.520 --> 2:01:39.320]  of you and so i said look i started this mess i'm gonna end this mess with my chin up with my
[2:01:39.320 --> 2:01:43.960]  dignity and i haven't i haven't done any fundraisers and i need to but you know i'm accepting
[2:01:43.960 --> 2:01:49.160]  prayers let you do it yeah i mean i'm really deep platform and you know which i appreciate
[2:01:49.160 --> 2:01:55.240]  you sharing the air with me so look the process is grueling it became my full-time job to find
[2:01:55.240 --> 2:02:00.680]  documents that don't exist and do exist for the committee and i'm prepping my lawyers in a very
[2:02:00.680 --> 2:02:05.400]  quick amount of time then there was a spiritual attack one of my lawyers has a heart attack
[2:02:05.400 --> 2:02:10.440]  and goes to the hospital literal hospital three or four days another one of my lawyers my long
[2:02:10.440 --> 2:02:17.160]  term lawyer gets coveted okay and not like coveted down and out coveted and i so i have three
[2:02:17.160 --> 2:02:22.840]  lawyers that i can't afford and and one of them is down and i'm covered ain't no joke no i've
[2:02:22.840 --> 2:02:27.080]  had i've had the flu and i've had cold this thing's like a mule kick in your ass and i'm just like

[2:02:32.600 --> 2:02:36.280]  in his vein and and he's communicating and we're doing everything we can and the committee
[2:02:36.280 --> 2:02:40.120]  is like we're gonna send you to jail we're gonna send you to jail we don't believe you're cooperating
[2:02:40.120 --> 2:02:45.080]  they accuse me of a crime okay that's when i thought of pleading the fifth they said we believe
[2:02:45.080 --> 2:02:50.040]  that all the alexander has either destroyed or withheld evidence because we saw this in a tucker
[2:02:50.040 --> 2:02:55.480]  carlson documentary i never had possession of any of that stuff and they're like oh okay our fault
[2:02:55.480 --> 2:03:01.240]  and i'm like you just accused me of a crime of a federal felony well that is have no chivalry
[2:03:01.240 --> 2:03:05.080]  yeah how would they like to be i would i would never treat them like i would never treat anyone
[2:03:05.080 --> 2:03:08.840]  like that all the power i wouldn't do this these people it's the worst experience of my life it's
[2:03:08.840 --> 2:03:15.560]  a single worst eight hours of my life okay i've i've i've gone to jail for 59 days before i have
[2:03:15.560 --> 2:03:20.520]  horrible mugshots if you go to google images i mean it's james brown and then some and you know

[2:03:25.960 --> 2:03:30.920]  him in court so i've i've been through the wringer this was the most intellectually challenging
[2:03:30.920 --> 2:03:34.520]  thing i've ever done because it's like really smart people really you can't believe you're this
[2:03:34.520 --> 2:03:39.560]  evil you're like dude you're lying it's it's like why are you lying about me like they have your bank
[2:03:39.560 --> 2:03:45.160]  account they don't care yeah yeah it's because they're part of the power you see yeah yeah it's
[2:03:45.160 --> 2:03:50.280]  like a stopo tactic and and i don't know if i was brave or courageous or maybe i'll i'm stupid you
[2:03:50.280 --> 2:03:55.320]  know maybe i did trip myself up and i will end up in jail but i was like i know that the committee
[2:03:55.320 --> 2:04:00.920]  is being fed lies on top of lying itself if i don't put the truth in the record then they can
[2:04:00.920 --> 2:04:06.040]  play ignorance in 10 years and 20 years which by the way we'll be heroes then okay we will be heroes
[2:04:06.040 --> 2:04:12.520]  for fighting for the left and the right so they are literally demonizing and typecasting anybody
[2:04:12.520 --> 2:04:17.320]  that is conservative or christian as a terrorist we've got to fight these people politically we

[2:06:14.200 --> 2:06:20.440]  wars dot com big brother doesn't want you to see video tucker carlson covers the pedo outbreak
[2:06:20.440 --> 2:06:27.080]  at cnn and claus schwaub openly calls for world government force microchipping uh you name it
[2:06:27.080 --> 2:06:35.160]  that is an incredible video the great reset still a conspiracy and finally somebody found the video
[2:06:35.160 --> 2:06:40.440]  because i i used to go out and protest the kkk of the nazis like probably 30 40 times they were
[2:06:40.440 --> 2:06:44.200]  threatened to kill me and then we got threatened the state police said you might stop this they
[2:06:44.200 --> 2:06:49.960]  had a plan to kill you that was like 15 years ago they finally found the hd footage and it's
[2:06:49.960 --> 2:06:54.600]  finally out that's an info wars dot com new footage of alex jones protesting the kkk
[2:06:54.600 --> 2:06:59.720]  discovered and a bunch of other footage of me protesting and it's not like oh look i'm an angel
[2:06:59.720 --> 2:07:04.520]  i'm protesting the kkk of the nazis the point is that's all i ever did because i know they're part
[2:07:04.520 --> 2:07:10.600]  of a globalist deep state operation that brings us to january 6 so ali you got cut off a lot of
[2:07:10.600 --> 2:07:15.320]  people are tuned in right now a lot huge audience right now you're the only guy that actually went
[2:07:15.320 --> 2:07:20.760]  to the lion's den and didn't uh you declare the fed because you're another to hide but now you see
[2:07:20.760 --> 2:07:25.800]  they were disingenuous as you just said so get back into these photos and what you witness and
[2:07:25.800 --> 2:07:31.640]  just everything you want to cover well again and this is we've only liked the photographer who took
[2:07:31.640 --> 2:07:36.280]  these pictures peter duke is a great photographer he's been working for decades and decades inside
[2:07:36.280 --> 2:07:42.440]  of hollywood exited hollywood said hey someone needs to capture the right more fairly okay and he has a
[2:07:42.440 --> 2:07:47.960]  book eventually coming out we've licensed these photos for info wars dot com exclusively so in
[2:07:47.960 --> 2:07:52.600]  my email it was like you can only use this on info wars and so we're breaking this exclusive
[2:07:52.600 --> 2:08:00.280]  these are photographs i made my lawyers provide the committee i begged for them to ask me questions
[2:08:00.280 --> 2:08:06.520]  about this because i'm a professional event organizer organizer and grassroots mobilizer
[2:08:06.520 --> 2:08:11.240]  they could ask me based off my expert testimony well how do you think this happened or what do you
[2:08:11.240 --> 2:08:16.760]  think happened or how could we make the capital safer i didn't get one question about how what
[2:08:16.760 --> 2:08:22.040]  recommendations would you have for us holly to make the capital building safer you really believe
[2:08:22.040 --> 2:08:29.560]  that congressmen ghosts are and ted crews sought to put their colleagues in jeopardy or themselves
[2:08:29.560 --> 2:08:34.840]  in jeopardy are you insane which destroyed what we wanted was a 10-day investigation that's what we
[2:08:34.840 --> 2:08:39.480]  wanted we had the opposite motive of this but who are these guys well yeah so these guys look these
[2:08:39.480 --> 2:08:46.920]  are ray ups 2.0 the i i believe so they weren't on the fbi website they are seen inciting the crowd
[2:08:46.920 --> 2:08:51.960]  okay and i and i say that understanding the law okay you don't get the media or the democrats
[2:08:51.960 --> 2:08:56.920]  who understand the law bradenberg versus ohio there must be an imminent threat after you
[2:08:56.920 --> 2:09:02.680]  verbally incite someone these guys literally are the ones who told people to storm the east side
[2:09:02.680 --> 2:09:08.280]  this is the senate side magnet doors are closed and who came through the west side and opened those
[2:09:08.280 --> 2:09:14.040]  east doors okay and these guys were coordinating now i don't know if the crew can find this but we
[2:09:14.040 --> 2:09:20.920]  should have a zoom in of the the ginger's earpiece okay and guess what i've had these photos since
[2:09:20.920 --> 2:09:25.800]  jed january and february handed it over to law enforcement tried to get some other news outlets
[2:09:25.800 --> 2:09:29.400]  to cover it no one would cover it i didn't give it to alex but you know because again we weren't
[2:09:29.400 --> 2:09:35.560]  talking but i was like i was in disbelief alex because i was like this is evidence and then when
[2:09:35.560 --> 2:09:40.440]  we were reviewing it four weeks ago we said we never saw the earpiece in this guy's ear until now
[2:09:41.240 --> 2:09:45.160]  and uh you know that was very very telling you're more the photos all you'll recognize which one
[2:09:45.160 --> 2:09:51.240]  yeah yeah and so you know it's just it's just it's just it's very troubling yeah let's keep going
[2:09:51.240 --> 2:09:55.480]  through these because eventually he takes down he takes off his gloves i mean i've studied you know
[2:09:55.480 --> 2:10:01.400]  i've studied these more than i i'd like to why do all of these guys have go pros because they were
[2:10:01.400 --> 2:10:10.600]  capturing photos of patriots that got caught in the chaos okay and so you know fake lanyard fake
[2:10:10.600 --> 2:10:18.120]  credential go pro trump insignia that's fake and an earpiece you tell me what that is and i think it's
[2:10:18.120 --> 2:10:22.600]  like right and he put scissors and all of it yeah and so they've got the medical scissors so that
[2:10:22.600 --> 2:10:29.480]  they can cut out a zip ties or put bandages around each other i mean there was a scyop a military
[2:10:29.480 --> 2:10:36.760]  grade scyop on january 6th and that's not a conspiracy theory that is a criminal conspiracy
[2:10:36.760 --> 2:10:43.320]  that is factually based and you're hearing it right here on info wars.com it's an exclusive
[2:10:44.760 --> 2:10:49.640]  why weren't these guys ever on the fbi website at least with ray epps they put them on the fbi
[2:10:49.640 --> 2:10:54.840]  website darin beteson great work and then took him off and they've never arrested him these guys never
[2:10:54.840 --> 2:11:02.280]  even made the fbi website you know so no facial recognition oh here's another one more in front
[2:11:02.280 --> 2:11:07.160]  of the committee what are they doing when you're giving them all this well we gave this to them
[2:11:07.160 --> 2:11:12.040]  the document production is ahead of your testimony so we gave this to them and earmarked and said all
[2:11:12.040 --> 2:11:17.240]  he would be like would like to be asked about this never came up and when i brought up agitators
[2:11:17.240 --> 2:11:23.000]  irolls when i brought up antifa irolls as i understand it other witnesses brought up
[2:11:23.000 --> 2:11:29.000]  antifa and irolls here's something people need to understand alex jones and olly alexander
[2:11:29.560 --> 2:11:35.160]  were the least aware people in the country of what was going on we weren't at the ellipse
[2:11:35.160 --> 2:11:39.080]  where they're getting a steady stream of tweets we weren't watching at our tv where they were
[2:11:39.080 --> 2:11:46.440]  getting footage we weren't we weren't nancy polosi who's in charge of capital security alex
[2:11:46.440 --> 2:11:51.880]  jones and i were literally the two most blind people in the country okay this is where they
[2:11:51.880 --> 2:11:58.280]  catch my photographer taking their picture i mean you can't make this up let's keep going through it
[2:11:58.280 --> 2:12:04.120]  there's some great photos we these guys are texting people and coordinating with people
[2:12:04.840 --> 2:12:08.760]  and and not all of them they end up pulling other people onto the truck so there are innocent
[2:12:08.760 --> 2:12:14.360]  people on the truck but they you know again my photographer can swear to an afghan
[2:12:14.360 --> 2:12:18.360]  tv viewers are seeing this radio listeners aren't oh yeah we should always remember we're also radio
[2:12:18.360 --> 2:12:24.760]  so describe for people again why this is so important this is important because it validates
[2:12:25.800 --> 2:12:31.480]  alex it validates what a gentleman told us after you and i left the east capital stairs when
[2:12:32.120 --> 2:12:36.040]  you know at the police behest palo said i watched them all get ready they all got an order and they
[2:12:36.040 --> 2:12:40.840]  all went in we watched a gentleman told us that and said i watched them dress out of black those
[2:12:40.840 --> 2:12:45.160]  aren't our people alex military guys i just watched them all stack up get ready and they were all
[2:12:45.160 --> 2:12:49.880]  do you have that on band dot tv i don't know but like that you basically got the first interview
[2:12:49.880 --> 2:12:56.040]  of anyone who said i was an eyewitness that people were here but then other people were here no one
[2:12:56.040 --> 2:13:00.760]  saw any counter protesters unless they were changing gear but that brings us to the next point
[2:13:00.760 --> 2:13:05.560]  what is list cheney going to do when it comes out she was financing the capital attack that
[2:13:05.560 --> 2:13:11.720]  breaks tomorrow what are they going to do as jan six committee member has business ties to china
[2:13:11.720 --> 2:13:18.040]  and chinese communist intelligence and then days after this breaks she announces she's resigning
[2:13:18.040 --> 2:13:23.080]  i mean what are they going to do she's on the committee a person connected to chinese intelligence
[2:13:23.080 --> 2:13:27.800]  look the chairman benny tomsen who's uh the only democrat out of mississippi
[2:13:28.600 --> 2:13:32.120]  poorest district i believe in the entire country and he served there for decades
[2:13:33.240 --> 2:13:39.720]  he has called people like me uncle tom he's basically called us the n word he called clarence
[2:13:39.720 --> 2:13:44.520]  thomas that justice clarence thomas that he does not like black republicans he is
[2:13:44.520 --> 2:13:51.880]  racially prejudiced against black republicans list cheney and adam kinsinger i've campaigned against
[2:13:51.880 --> 2:13:58.920]  a campaign against so the only two democrat appointed republicans i've campaigned against
[2:13:58.920 --> 2:14:02.200]  there's a conflict of interest all over this thing alex and when you break the news about
[2:14:02.200 --> 2:14:07.240]  list cheney tomorrow people are gonna say half this committee one they're supposed to legally
[2:14:07.240 --> 2:14:13.640]  have 13 members of the committee they only have nine and half of them are compromised by china or
[2:14:13.640 --> 2:14:22.760]  the deep state or through campaigns that we've opposed them on or getting the permits or getting
[2:14:22.760 --> 2:14:27.960]  the permits so i gotta tell you how you can't make this up you know they thought they had us pinned
[2:14:27.960 --> 2:14:35.400]  down and and what we're doing is we're saying we will cooperate where the law requires and we will
[2:14:35.400 --> 2:14:39.880]  invoke our constitutional right well let's just be clear now list cheney had all the permits
[2:14:39.880 --> 2:14:44.440]  around so we couldn't get the main ones we had to get one way on the back she totally got caught
[2:14:44.440 --> 2:14:53.160]  sorry breaking tomorrow fall alex oh i think i think america is not ready for what you're
[2:14:53.160 --> 2:14:58.200]  about to present tomorrow i was supposed to do it yesterday but i was i was supposed to get it
[2:14:58.200 --> 2:15:03.400]  ready yesterday for today but we got behind it's so insane it's insane and it's occupying all of
[2:15:03.400 --> 2:15:07.880]  our life and all of our money you brought them up we should not told you this the kramers yep it is
[2:15:07.880 --> 2:15:13.560]  the kramers and and guess what their consultants verified this they told the media and they told
[2:15:13.560 --> 2:15:17.320]  the committee this so this is you know stuff that i haven't talked to you since you came live you
[2:15:17.320 --> 2:15:24.200]  know about this i i know that their consultant revealed the 2019 capital permit and then the
[2:15:24.200 --> 2:15:31.240]  inside the capital it's ongoing list cheney yeah i i didn't find out about this until six days ago
[2:15:31.240 --> 2:15:39.000]  okay so again it's occupying you can't make this up it's a full-time job to try to keep up with this
[2:15:39.720 --> 2:15:44.120]  the story arc that you and i have been wrapped up in but guess what we're going to swing till it
[2:15:44.120 --> 2:15:51.400]  comes out what list cheney did yeah he's on the committee committee yeah we'll be right back with
[2:15:51.400 --> 2:16:01.480]  ali alexander stay with us it's hard to believe that christmas 2021 is here and soon we'll be in
[2:16:01.480 --> 2:16:13.960]  the year 2022 everything the globalist plan on doing their entire operations hinge on you psychologically
[2:16:13.960 --> 2:16:17.960]  not understanding that they're trying to break your will that they're trying to
[2:16:17.960 --> 2:16:23.640]  you drive you into submission but if you're aware of this basic fact and how they are
[2:16:24.200 --> 2:16:31.000]  scientifically controlling you then you're basically immune this is next level information
[2:16:31.000 --> 2:16:36.120]  on how to take control of your mind it's how i've been able to stand against the incredible
[2:16:36.120 --> 2:16:42.360]  attacks they've carried out because i'm able to connect to the divine i'm able to transcend
[2:16:42.360 --> 2:16:47.720]  this dimension simply by becoming aware of the fact that i already transcended it show until
[2:16:47.720 --> 2:16:54.520]  christmas day we're offering reset wars are incredible two-part course for 25 off at reset

[2:20:45.560 --> 2:20:49.720]  survive
[2:20:52.200 --> 2:20:58.360]  I had a good friend in new york city he never called me by my name just till billy
[2:20:59.160 --> 2:21:04.680]  all right ollie alexander you're here you're talking about january 6 which they now are branding
[2:21:05.400 --> 2:21:11.720]  as all americans are terrorists and midwesterners westerners southerners anybody that doesn't love
[2:21:11.720 --> 2:21:17.000]  pedophilia anybody that doesn't live a globalist we're bad the pentagon's got to stop us i mean
[2:21:17.000 --> 2:21:21.400]  it's everywhere they got to root us out from the military and root us out from the school boards
[2:21:21.400 --> 2:21:26.840]  root us out from government root us out from media you know bull crap you know the fbi has a threat
[2:21:26.840 --> 2:21:32.920]  tag associated with you me and anybody else who they consider associated with uh january 6
[2:21:32.920 --> 2:21:38.600]  mind you january 6 is a date january 6 was overwhelmingly peaceful and then we're being
[2:21:38.600 --> 2:21:43.000]  lumped in with people who again some aren't bad people some are and let's talk about this the
[2:21:43.000 --> 2:21:48.760]  january 6 defendants they are rotting away in an american gulag yes it's when does like walking
[2:21:48.760 --> 2:21:53.960]  through velvet robes when the police let you in mean that like 10 months later you're still in jail
[2:21:55.640 --> 2:22:00.920]  it's probably the single worst thing to have happened in our country look i i'm a descendant
[2:22:00.920 --> 2:22:10.200]  of american slaves and i got to tell you this is worse than anything i've seen in american history
[2:22:10.200 --> 2:22:17.240]  if you get trumped up on a misdemeanor charge and you are in pre you are in confinement pretrial
[2:22:17.800 --> 2:22:23.480]  and the judge says well admit your guilt say you're sorry and i'll consider bailing you out
[2:22:23.480 --> 2:22:29.000]  that's in the news they go oh we let this person go they said america's bad yeah it's a reeducation
[2:22:29.000 --> 2:22:33.960]  it's like in north vietnam when our piles will be shut down i mean it's that bad yeah oh you know
[2:22:33.960 --> 2:22:38.920]  you know when it's when it's john mccain and the viet con doing it it's bad when it's the american
[2:22:38.920 --> 2:22:44.840]  government on its own citizens it's good this is not due process this is not the great tradition
[2:22:44.840 --> 2:22:50.600]  of anglo common law this is entirely why our country was founded we were like we don't want
[2:22:50.600 --> 2:22:56.360]  general warrants we want due process and you can't lock someone up before a jury of their peers find
[2:22:56.360 --> 2:23:01.720]  some guilty we've done away with all of that and these people not all not only that but they're in
[2:23:01.720 --> 2:23:06.200]  solitary confinement so some people say they're at this whole thing is so regressive they're like
[2:23:06.840 --> 2:23:13.080]  ali how are you getting through this you know they've done you the worst and i said you know
[2:23:13.080 --> 2:23:17.560]  selfishly knowing that it does get worse no no they wanted you and they want us both they thought
[2:23:17.560 --> 2:23:22.680]  they're gonna set us up we alex whoever told the secret service to lead roger to the front and have
[2:23:22.680 --> 2:23:27.240]  us there wanted to blame us and thought we'd be dumb and like yeah let's attack the capital
[2:23:28.280 --> 2:23:35.240]  but you have to admit we watched that there was an energy to what was going on that pulled a lot
[2:23:35.240 --> 2:23:39.960]  of people in now thankfully you and i never you know were caught up in that but it was almost
[2:23:39.960 --> 2:23:45.240]  like we were magnetically pulled towards that and so when a lot of patriots tell me that they're
[2:23:45.240 --> 2:23:51.480]  like ali i was just i was i was compelled to get closer i'm like i felt that compelling too
[2:23:51.480 --> 2:23:57.000]  but when i look on the end this is what i told the committee alex and i are rounding the bow
[2:23:57.960 --> 2:24:04.440]  and we watch this scene that looks like cgi i thought somebody had hijacked my glasses people
[2:24:04.440 --> 2:24:08.920]  are climbing the wall like spider man okay there's like nerd there's gas hitting his
[2:24:08.920 --> 2:24:15.320]  the faces i was like what what are we watching world war z and then but my number one concern
[2:24:15.320 --> 2:24:20.440]  and this is when you and i got very protective of that crowd is watching human beings climb on that
[2:24:20.440 --> 2:24:26.360]  scaffolding knowing that they could that could have toppled and killed them and so you and i ran
[2:24:26.360 --> 2:24:32.120]  and we got on wet metal chairs we almost slipped we have security holding our belt buckles those
[2:24:32.120 --> 2:24:36.360]  are those pallets of chairs like six feet high yes while we're like standing on these rocking
[2:24:36.360 --> 2:24:41.400]  chairs like stop stop but no one can hear us we saved lives that day and i and it took me my
[2:24:41.400 --> 2:24:44.840]  lawyers eventually when they reviewed all the evidence they're like are you aware that you and
[2:24:44.840 --> 2:24:49.320]  alex jones actually save lives and oh and shroy you guys save lives you didn't have a neutral
[2:24:49.320 --> 2:24:53.480]  position you didn't have just a position of deescalating and taking and doing the police job
[2:24:54.040 --> 2:24:59.720]  you saved lives he said you probably saved 5 000 people imagine if a percentage of those a lot of
[2:24:59.720 --> 2:25:03.400]  people called in they were to keep going in the doors were open they didn't know what no one knew
[2:25:03.400 --> 2:25:09.000]  better no it not about thousands in jail and and and guess what thanks to darin beatty's work and
[2:25:09.000 --> 2:25:14.440]  tucker carlson's work and the work of julie kelly kelly for the first time in my life i'm seeing these
[2:25:14.440 --> 2:25:21.480]  these signs that say area closed alex when you and i approached the west side not only did we not see
[2:25:21.480 --> 2:25:26.680]  signs we didn't see fencing we never saw a pile of fencing so someone strategically took down the
[2:25:26.680 --> 2:25:31.240]  fencing piled it up and then moved the pile itself yeah there was there weren't even knocked down
[2:25:31.240 --> 2:25:35.320]  fences it was breaking news no one has ever actually because alex and i have never talked
[2:25:36.520 --> 2:25:42.200]  we've no one's actually heard our account of the events everyone assumes that oh ali and alex
[2:25:42.200 --> 2:25:45.960]  have a pipe in a cnn they should have known it was violent they should have known this was trump
[2:25:45.960 --> 2:25:52.120]  supporters or whatever it's like we walked into a melee in which there are bystanders there people
[2:25:52.120 --> 2:25:57.320]  caught up in it there were agitators there there were journalists there was us there were security
[2:25:57.320 --> 2:26:01.800]  teams oan alex and all you were in a security bubble let's be clear what when rey abbs breaks
[2:26:01.800 --> 2:26:07.640]  through trump is still speaking we haven't left yet we haven't left yet we haven't even left yet
[2:26:07.640 --> 2:26:13.800]  some reporter asked me on background the only two reporters i've talked to on background only two
[2:26:13.800 --> 2:26:19.880]  out of the 500 that have reached out to me and they said what do you think went wrong in the walk
[2:26:19.880 --> 2:26:23.400]  over from the ellipse to the capital i said nothing what are you talking about have you read the
[2:26:23.400 --> 2:26:29.000]  intelligence reports seven a.m the police say this is going to be a problem at the capital
[2:26:29.560 --> 2:26:34.200]  and i'm like okay they're calling for help early they're not bad they're they're unmaned on purpose
[2:26:34.200 --> 2:26:39.400]  right they're unmanned and so it wasn't bad people but it later becomes a bad leadership yeah and so
[2:26:40.120 --> 2:26:45.320]  they're they're serious failures of police of intelligence and speaker polosi who's tasked
[2:26:45.320 --> 2:26:51.080]  with this she ordered the sergeant arms to stand down we don't know multiple times multiple times
[2:26:51.080 --> 2:26:54.680]  not it's so obvious it's so i was wondering when you were going to testify because i think you brought
[2:26:54.680 --> 2:26:59.240]  this up to them how do they think they're going to have a fiasco where we don't expose that they're
[2:26:59.240 --> 2:27:03.320]  involved in this like they're accusing us private depositions that's why they're doing it behind
[2:27:03.320 --> 2:27:07.240]  closed doors they take it all out of context right no one's going to watch info wars no one's
[2:27:07.240 --> 2:27:10.200]  going to watch info wars no one's going to listen to julie kelly no one's going to listen to darin
[2:27:10.200 --> 2:27:16.040]  beatty but guess what folks we're uniting the conservative and the patriot and the believer
[2:27:16.040 --> 2:27:20.520]  movements again this was what they feared about what we did during stop the steel the peaceful stop
[2:27:20.520 --> 2:27:24.920]  the steel movement they're saying we're going to unite everyone and while part of the right hasn't
[2:27:24.920 --> 2:27:32.440]  wanted to touch january 6 i will go to my dying breath making sure the truth of january 6 is known
[2:27:32.440 --> 2:27:38.280]  and that due process rights are fought for so that when history looks back they judge these death
[2:27:38.280 --> 2:27:44.440]  spots these demonic democrat death spots for what they are and that's tyrants they are tyrants i
[2:27:44.440 --> 2:27:49.320]  agree if the republicans and trump's got a press conference an hour we'll cover it if we just expose

[2:33:42.120 --> 2:33:52.360]  world wide it's alex jones if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance so
[2:33:54.360 --> 2:33:59.800]  i told everybody i said this january sixth thing they're branding it as all americans are terrorist
[2:33:59.800 --> 2:34:04.440]  all veterans are terrorists gun owners are terrorists people that protest lockdowns are
[2:34:04.440 --> 2:34:10.120]  terrorist people that question elections are terrorist and now they've got this fiasco committee
[2:34:10.120 --> 2:34:16.120]  with the wheels coming off with one member being a chi-comm agent resigning list cheney being
[2:34:16.120 --> 2:34:21.480]  involved in attacks on the capital we're breaking tomorrow all of this ali alexander is with us
[2:34:21.480 --> 2:34:26.920]  right now again it's bigger than alex jones it's bigger than ali alexander it's not about us saying
[2:34:26.920 --> 2:34:31.000]  oh it's bigger than us to act like we don't care about ourselves of course we care about ourselves
[2:34:31.000 --> 2:34:38.440]  people have to get this is a big move to demonize the american people ahead of the midterms in
[2:34:38.440 --> 2:34:46.200]  322 days it's absolutely true and i'm holding alex jones's lawsuit right here it's very very well
[2:34:46.200 --> 2:34:51.080]  written and everyone needs to just take a moment to read it especially the fourth amendment because
[2:34:51.080 --> 2:34:57.000]  it applies to you now here's a little history lesson the british crown had what was called
[2:34:57.000 --> 2:35:01.240]  general warrants they were fishing expeditions so they were authorized by the government
[2:35:01.240 --> 2:35:06.280]  to pick a target and then search for any type of crime they're illegal they've always been illegal
[2:35:06.280 --> 2:35:10.200]  inside of america and in our bill of rights we have the fourth amendment that says well that you
[2:35:10.200 --> 2:35:17.560]  can't be you know doing all this stuff unreasonable searches and seizures well this committee has said
[2:35:17.560 --> 2:35:23.640]  we're not subject to the executive branch rule so ours can be more wide-ranging and the court
[2:35:23.640 --> 2:35:30.120]  has ruled that congressional subpoenas can be broader this in some cases that is asking for
[2:35:30.120 --> 2:35:37.400]  19 months from some witnesses of activity none of us have been criminally accused alex that's
[2:35:37.400 --> 2:35:42.440]  worth pointing out all so all of us are private citizens who haven't been criminally accused
[2:35:42.440 --> 2:35:46.120]  and then some of them are people who didn't even attend the rally and they're saying we want all
[2:35:46.120 --> 2:35:52.280]  your at&t data we want all your verizon data your ip address the the length of the sessions of your
[2:35:52.280 --> 2:35:57.800]  calls who pinged your cell phone and they're looking for anything anything that's something you see what
[2:35:57.800 --> 2:36:05.480]  meadows gives them it wasn't enough and and the point is is that they act like when people are calling
[2:36:05.480 --> 2:36:11.880]  up saying stop this as if trump was in full command they're saying no help stop it yeah yeah trump was
[2:36:11.880 --> 2:36:18.760]  definitely not in full campaign command you know as as as i can testify uh the trump campaign fell
[2:36:18.760 --> 2:36:23.320]  apart the r&c fell apart which is why it stopped to seal well by the end he had no supporters he had
[2:36:23.320 --> 2:36:29.320]  no staff no staff he was decapitated so so tell us more about the eight hours inside the lion's den
[2:36:29.320 --> 2:36:35.160]  what was happening like i said it was traumatic i mean i'm having to relive events that i've gone
[2:36:35.160 --> 2:36:42.600]  to clergy for and i've gone to therapy for um i'm having to face all these uh tactics right
[2:36:42.600 --> 2:36:47.960]  they're not searching for the truth it's not a factual inquiry uh into what information i might
[2:36:47.960 --> 2:36:53.960]  uniquely have it's confronting me you know awli in arizona on december 19th you said this at this
[2:36:53.960 --> 2:36:58.440]  time you were standing with this and this person and then on this day you said this and this and
[2:36:58.440 --> 2:37:02.600]  didn't you want to foam in a violent revolution at the end of the blah blah blah and that's literally
[2:37:02.600 --> 2:37:08.760]  the last question they asked me it was like 10 pull quotes and time stamps and i almost came out of
[2:37:08.760 --> 2:37:14.840]  my chair i was so offended i'm like i'm offended that you think i would want an unarmed insurrection
[2:37:14.840 --> 2:37:20.680]  insurrection i'm not dumb i'm just not exactly we're playing a takeover the capital with no guns
[2:37:20.680 --> 2:37:27.000]  yeah with grandma and grandpa at the captain not being ready for their setup we we stepped on our
[2:37:27.640 --> 2:37:32.840]  dick chaney yeah so the idea that we did this on purpose is just preposterous it's preposterous
[2:37:32.840 --> 2:37:38.600]  and who could have known we had two rallies in dc they were entirely peaceful i had 500 that's why
[2:37:38.600 --> 2:37:44.440]  we were caught black because it was the last thing it was like we're gonna get defeated we'll we'll
[2:37:44.440 --> 2:37:49.640]  take a moral stance we'll have a list of rhino republicans to primary we'll show you have a huge
[2:37:49.640 --> 2:37:55.960]  crowd huge crowd the biggest crowd trumps ever had by the way okay huge honor for us and and and by the
[2:37:55.960 --> 2:38:00.440]  way we were like we're gonna recreate the tea party movement but bigger and that's why the
[2:38:00.440 --> 2:38:05.480]  establishment republicans are in on this because they don't want their incumbents to be primary
[2:38:05.480 --> 2:38:10.520]  they're like well if republican wave is coming we want to be full of incumbents so who is the biggest
[2:38:10.520 --> 2:38:19.080]  beneficiary of subverting tag crews paul gozar mo brooks you know in all of these conservative
[2:38:19.080 --> 2:38:24.120]  members of congress and then ruining lot eight never happened so i let me tell the press this
[2:38:24.120 --> 2:38:29.240]  i'm gonna sue your asses off if you say that the stop the steel rally descended into chaos or
[2:38:29.240 --> 2:38:36.040]  morphed into a riot that is factually false the lot eight event at one o'clock never happened
[2:38:36.040 --> 2:38:41.080]  it never happened okay this is a matter of fact and it's about to be adjudicated by the law you
[2:38:41.080 --> 2:38:45.800]  want to sue somebody it's the mpr they're like jones and alexander secretly led the groups
[2:38:45.800 --> 2:38:50.840]  they knew there was no event they cowardly ordered the attack if you haven't seen these mpr i haven't
[2:38:50.840 --> 2:38:56.520]  oh my god they've got reports they just it's as bad as uh adam schiff where he reads the
[2:38:56.520 --> 2:39:02.120]  fake transcript of trump yeah i mean it's crazy man what's funny is is adam schiff is is using
[2:39:02.120 --> 2:39:07.560]  the same tactics that he used against roger and trump in this select committee hearing where he
[2:39:07.560 --> 2:39:13.960]  manufactures jim jordan's text messages to mark meadows he artificially young it's a copy and
[2:39:13.960 --> 2:39:19.640]  paste and hasn't nancy nancy polosi talked about this she said it's a wrap up smear we lie we do
[2:39:19.640 --> 2:39:24.440]  this and then we wrap it up and package it to the press and you guys repeat it i mean their playbook
[2:39:24.440 --> 2:39:28.200]  is out there in the open but this time they're playing for keeps alex that's the thing is she's
[2:39:28.200 --> 2:39:33.400]  so senile she said that i forgot yep repeat that it's the it's called the wrap up smear she had a
[2:39:33.400 --> 2:39:39.400]  press conference in which she was so drunk and this isn't this is an open secret in capitol hill
[2:39:39.400 --> 2:39:44.600]  she drinks vodka all day long it's at a roll not yet and it takes at all and there's nothing wrong
[2:39:44.600 --> 2:39:50.440]  with that except for she does these press conferences drunk and at one point she says well they'll
[2:39:50.440 --> 2:39:54.760]  accuse us of this we'll accuse them of this we wrap it up and give it to the press and you guys say
[2:39:54.760 --> 2:40:00.680]  whatever you want hey she called it a wrap up smear you know you know maybe google's blocked this
[2:40:00.680 --> 2:40:06.200]  but this is a very like famous moment from two or three years ago in which uh she told us the
[2:40:06.200 --> 2:40:09.880]  playbook and they're using that same playbook here and that's why they're surprised they're like
[2:40:09.880 --> 2:40:14.520]  ollie's a witness we coward him we'll use him against roger and alex and then i'm like no i'm
[2:40:14.520 --> 2:40:19.640]  gonna sue you on top of testifying i'm gonna say we have something to hide we have nothing we obviously
[2:40:19.640 --> 2:40:25.240]  didn't want an attack on the capitol means like idiots yeah yeah i mean it's it's unfortunate
[2:40:25.240 --> 2:40:30.600]  what happened but you said this in your in your commercial break we were called to this moment
[2:40:30.600 --> 2:40:36.600]  god called this weird group of glad flies or as archbishop vegano says you know you know these
[2:40:36.600 --> 2:40:42.440]  people are gonna take on the deep church in the deep state this union of globalists that control
[2:40:42.440 --> 2:40:46.680]  everything and and i'm someone who didn't believe this alex i'm someone who's like i'm never gonna
[2:40:46.680 --> 2:40:51.080]  go in here for wars and then you know i finally come on it was when rosa and borrowers accused of
[2:40:51.080 --> 2:40:56.680]  racism which you know it was preposterous that was the first time i ever came on your show and and i
[2:40:56.680 --> 2:41:01.400]  was like why because i want to fight with the truth tellers you know i don't have time for my
[2:41:01.400 --> 2:41:07.480]  republican colleagues i have time for the truth tellers and and so i was like there's no time to
[2:41:07.480 --> 2:41:13.400]  be depressed anymore ollie because they literally want to shut down elections and blame us for it
[2:41:13.400 --> 2:41:19.240]  you know it's crazy what do you think happens to the uh huge shaman and then they're still in jail
[2:41:19.240 --> 2:41:25.720]  it's seven months later yeah i it breaks my heart because look if people commit it wrong doing first
[2:41:27.000 --> 2:41:31.640]  the government should have the evidence in a lot of cases they don't so that they're keeping them in
[2:41:31.640 --> 2:41:38.360]  jail longer and in the constitution you're guaranteed a fast and speed trial okay and the reason
[2:41:38.360 --> 2:41:45.000]  because again the king's crown used to do this the second thing is that you're guaranteed a defense
[2:41:45.000 --> 2:41:51.800]  well how can you have a defense when nance plosive won't release the 14 000 hours that are outside of
[2:41:51.800 --> 2:41:56.200]  for you really what's exposing them they won't release the raw footage right and thank god by
[2:41:56.200 --> 2:41:59.960]  a miracle we have a judge who finally said you have to release some of the tunnel footage where
[2:41:59.960 --> 2:42:05.240]  you guys kill the woman okay and and maybe i'll come back on we'll talk about that it yeah final
[2:42:05.240 --> 2:42:09.720]  segment i had a paul joseph watson taking over and then you're going to be back on the war room
[2:42:09.720 --> 2:42:15.080]  today yeah back in the war room with the orange shroy has been criminally charged with attacking
[2:42:15.080 --> 2:42:20.600]  the capital and breaching it and they saved the charges he was not with alex jones that's bullcrap
[2:42:20.600 --> 2:42:24.920]  it's we were all in the same security bubble because what we saw was like there's left this
[2:42:24.920 --> 2:42:28.360]  and then there's other people on the right who are caught up in this but we were concerned about our
[2:42:28.360 --> 2:42:34.040]  safety and and and in a lot of ways we were victims from the civil authority collapsing
[2:42:34.040 --> 2:42:38.600]  you know exactly and and and if anything we were just naive about how we get out we were we were
[2:42:38.600 --> 2:42:42.760]  super naive but i continue to pray for those j6 defendants caught in the dc jail there's still
[2:42:42.760 --> 2:42:47.080]  44 of them who haven't been granted bell and and we all ought to pray for them because they have a
[2:42:47.080 --> 2:42:51.160]  lot a hell of a lot worse they've been like knocking their eyes out and torturing them and it's bad
[2:42:51.160 --> 2:42:59.880]  it's very bad ollie alexander is our guest stay with us so this could be literally your last chance

[2:47:16.280 --> 2:47:43.880]  so we are monitoring the puppet joe biden's press conference it started about four minutes ago
[2:47:43.880 --> 2:47:49.160]  he said we should all wear a mask indoors he showed without a mask it's it's totally insane

[2:47:54.280 --> 2:48:00.120]  info wars feed but alexander getting back to january 6 again bigger than alexander bigger
[2:48:00.120 --> 2:48:05.240]  than alex jones i thought would tucker carlson others exposed that the democrats provocateur
[2:48:05.240 --> 2:48:09.960]  it that they would back off they have it and so they got the pentagon announcing all americans
[2:48:09.960 --> 2:48:16.760]  are terrorists anybody that's a conservative as the enemy you can't overstate how draconian and
[2:48:16.760 --> 2:48:22.120]  dangerous this is the last segment we've got with you just recapping and where you see this going
[2:48:22.120 --> 2:48:27.880]  and what you witnessed in the eight hours of the committee this is only the beginning if we thought
[2:48:27.880 --> 2:48:35.800]  that january 6 was an american dream that turned into an american nightmare where the left was going
[2:48:35.800 --> 2:48:41.720]  to let us get away with a moral defeat or our dignity folks i'm here to tell you someone who
[2:48:41.720 --> 2:48:49.480]  suffered a lot of it um that we're about half done at best the democrats are going to trot out
[2:48:50.040 --> 2:48:56.520]  a former president of the united states in a historic attempt to bait and switch a civil war
[2:48:56.520 --> 2:49:04.920]  that we oppose they are going to use the military to frame to frame military service men and service
[2:49:04.920 --> 2:49:10.200]  women as extremists that they then jail they are going to jail one or two of us witnesses
[2:49:10.920 --> 2:49:16.360]  and uh keep us in your prayers and um essentially what you're watching is a coup d'etat
[2:49:17.800 --> 2:49:25.240]  act two of three acts at shutting down free and fair elections in america that's what all this is
[2:49:25.240 --> 2:49:31.240]  about this is about making universal mail-in ballots permanent drop off boxes permanent
[2:49:31.240 --> 2:49:37.640]  and that anyone who scrutinizes and says hey the states make the laws saying you can't say that
[2:49:37.640 --> 2:49:44.440]  anymore and uh you you know folks it's it's surreal if you wrote this in a fiction book or a script
[2:49:44.440 --> 2:49:50.440]  you no one would believe it and so what they're doing is they're gaslighting they're inverting
[2:49:51.000 --> 2:49:59.160]  and they're attacking us spiritually politically mentally and now in some cases very physically
[2:49:59.160 --> 2:50:04.120]  so this is the dark winter we all thought that was going to be last winter this is the dark winter
[2:50:04.120 --> 2:50:08.840]  that joe biden dementia joe biden remember the only phrase he could absolutely remember was dark
[2:50:08.840 --> 2:50:15.640]  winter how bizarre here we are in the dark winter that's right they've been preparing us for the
[2:50:15.640 --> 2:50:20.120]  beginning ollie ellington or what do you think this is going i like i said i think it's the end
[2:50:20.120 --> 2:50:25.720]  of elections the committee report i already know okay it was leaked to me ollie a huge section of
[2:50:25.720 --> 2:50:30.040]  the committee report is actually going to focus on your language and say that either trump
[2:50:30.680 --> 2:50:36.760]  disowns you and disavows you or he endorsed you and they said if they can loop it twice they'll
[2:50:36.760 --> 2:50:43.160]  loop it twice and this lie that the white house was worried about ollie alexander and worried
[2:50:43.160 --> 2:50:47.000]  about alex jones and worried about roger stone i know that the committee has evidence that that's
[2:50:47.000 --> 2:50:53.320]  entirely a fake story planted by political opportunist on the right so that's already debunked but
[2:50:53.320 --> 2:50:58.440]  there that'll be the kramers yeah unfortunately it is and i'm i've told people i've told reporters
[2:50:59.240 --> 2:51:05.880]  if the kramers and their agents of division this office tree if they lie to the committee that's
[2:51:05.880 --> 2:51:11.880]  perjury and i plan to recommend them to the doj for criminal prosecution there'll be a stop to steal
[2:51:11.880 --> 2:51:18.760]  criminal referral and against these people so i had nothing to hide um you know i have rights
[2:51:18.760 --> 2:51:23.640]  that are worth protecting but you know i i really respect what you and you're doing and roger's
[2:51:23.640 --> 2:51:29.480]  doing you know journalists are doing to protect the first amendment for everybody else right yeah
[2:51:29.480 --> 2:51:33.800]  for those who don't get this is the tip of the spear of their takeover of the american people's
[2:51:33.800 --> 2:51:38.920]  rights and freedoms and and literally branding us as the new terror threat so of course we followed
[2:51:38.920 --> 2:51:44.360]  suit uh to to protect our records nothing to hide but they don't just get to run around and do this
[2:51:44.360 --> 2:51:48.280]  well that's what i find entertaining about mine look let's say i lose my lawsuit and i'm not going
[2:51:48.280 --> 2:51:53.480]  to because it's a really well written lawsuit it argues that the fourth amendment is abolished if
[2:51:53.480 --> 2:51:59.000]  a court doesn't limit the scope of of these uh general warrants these illegal general warrants
[2:51:59.000 --> 2:52:04.360]  and we essentially say even if you get all these phone records they don't expose anything so that's
[2:52:04.360 --> 2:52:09.240]  why i knew i had to sue because i was like okay if you get my phone records i really kind of won't
[2:52:09.240 --> 2:52:14.200]  care in as much as it acknowledges that i have no more constitutional rights but there's nothing
[2:52:14.200 --> 2:52:19.480]  in my phone records that contradict my testimony in my document production so you can't catch me
[2:52:19.480 --> 2:52:23.720]  on anything and that's why i'm like i'm going to court and that's why i was glad to see you as a
[2:52:23.720 --> 2:52:28.440]  journalist go to court and why i'm glad to see general flin general flin did not organize did not
[2:52:28.440 --> 2:52:36.280]  speak did not participate so why are you seizing his records so you know people really have to
[2:52:36.280 --> 2:52:42.760]  appreciate how psychopathic this is if joseph mccarthy and there's some things i agree with
[2:52:42.760 --> 2:52:47.400]  with joseph mccarthy okay there wasn't a red scare there was a red reality in america that had
[2:52:47.400 --> 2:52:53.480]  infiltrated institutions and has still infiltrated institutions in america but his tactics were
[2:52:53.480 --> 2:52:57.640]  unamerican okay and then the house he was in the senate the house had something called the
[2:52:57.640 --> 2:53:04.120]  unamerican activities committee and that was unamerican okay what they're doing now exceeds
[2:53:04.120 --> 2:53:10.920]  the power of the 9 11 9 11 commission anything joseph mccarthy did anything that the unamerican
[2:53:10.920 --> 2:53:16.040]  others no doubt and the left loves it they just all over twitter all over facebook oh arrest them oh
[2:53:16.040 --> 2:53:22.520]  we can't wait oh yeah arrest me for what you know arrest alex for what this i'm not i'm not exaggerating
[2:53:22.520 --> 2:53:27.720]  here this is a factual statement this isn't in my opinion there has never been a more powerful
[2:53:27.720 --> 2:53:34.600]  legislative committee in all of america's history than this jan six select committee
[2:53:34.600 --> 2:53:41.480]  which was tasked with investigating a capital attack and instead is investigating the free speech
[2:53:41.480 --> 2:53:48.120]  lawful assembly and and citizens seeking redress from their government prior to january 6th
[2:53:48.120 --> 2:53:55.480]  sometimes going back to april 2020 april 2020 with people who didn't participate in anything
[2:53:57.000 --> 2:54:03.800]  wake up folks the war is here and we're not fighting it with guns we're fighting with information
[2:54:03.800 --> 2:54:09.320]  with the truth waking up people and some people are saying uh we're a little uneasy about this
[2:54:09.320 --> 2:54:14.200]  there's a liberal group called pogo that wrote the committee a letter and said we think you might
[2:54:14.200 --> 2:54:19.240]  be exceeding your powers are no i've said what are you doing committees this is dangerous it's
[2:54:19.240 --> 2:54:24.040]  super dangerous it's super chilling but this is the dark winner so folks be prepared for the gas
[2:54:24.040 --> 2:54:29.800]  lighting like you've never seen it's the military it's a vaccine it's the variant it's jan six it's
[2:54:29.800 --> 2:54:34.440]  the forefront attack on speech it's a bunch of corporate interests that want full control of the
[2:54:34.440 --> 2:54:39.240]  country and they've bought off politicians they're just seeing what they'll do because the politicians
[2:54:39.240 --> 2:54:43.640]  are the ones that will get destroyed right they they don't feel like they're being held accountable
[2:54:44.200 --> 2:54:48.920]  apple and google and facebook and you know i'm glad you brought that up it's you know sometimes
[2:54:48.920 --> 2:54:53.800]  people they asked me two things when i when i interview with alex jones they said you guys
[2:54:53.800 --> 2:54:57.960]  when you guys get going you guys marry the spiritual and the political and people like really
[2:54:57.960 --> 2:55:02.280]  like seeing us together and then they're like why does alex let you talk he doesn't let his other
[2:55:02.280 --> 2:55:06.760]  guys talk and i'm like i have such great respect for this man and what he just pointed out i thought
[2:55:06.760 --> 2:55:12.840]  a lot of people miss but alex just said it right and that's um well now i just forgot what you just
[2:55:12.840 --> 2:55:17.640]  said that i was about to compliment but what people need to realize is remind me what you just said
[2:55:17.640 --> 2:55:24.600]  i don't remember it's okay the point is is that we're here and they don't want people to know
[2:55:24.600 --> 2:55:29.320]  that this is the main takeover this is the main assault i mean this is branding everyone that
[2:55:29.320 --> 2:55:34.440]  questions the power structures terrorist it's really simple yeah it is that simple and and
[2:55:34.440 --> 2:55:38.920]  you know we're just called to a unique time and i that's really bugging me that i can't remember
[2:55:38.920 --> 2:55:45.560]  what you just said what was i saying i'm not very uh i love the crowd they have their own lively
[2:55:45.560 --> 2:55:48.920]  discussions in there it's all of the world yeah we ought to put cameras in there but we'll figure
[2:55:48.920 --> 2:55:53.560]  out a more highly rated show oh yeah cameras in the control room all the talking going on in there
[2:55:53.560 --> 2:55:57.880]  yeah i i think they'd uh they'd be forced to work no this is a really a really great crew but
[2:55:57.880 --> 2:56:00.920]  all they're awesome but we'll put it we'll put we'll find an exclusive and we'll put it on info
[2:56:00.920 --> 2:56:05.080]  wars.com but it was something i actually pointed out to my lawyers the point that you just made
[2:56:05.080 --> 2:56:08.600]  and it was lost on everyone and i was like you know this is the point that you really need to focus
[2:56:08.600 --> 2:56:13.320]  on but here we are folks and everybody's involved in this this is not about us this is about whether
[2:56:13.320 --> 2:56:17.960]  we have a bill of rights or not well it's about oh here we go here we go there's a monopolistic
[2:56:17.960 --> 2:56:24.120]  control and i told someone i said look joe biden made a deal with the devil he thinks he's gonna
[2:56:24.120 --> 2:56:29.400]  get the better end of that deal folks the corporate interests they're perfectly fine burning down
[2:56:29.400 --> 2:56:33.080]  kamala harris and joe biden so that's what you just pointed out i was really grateful for that
[2:56:33.080 --> 2:56:37.080]  because i've not heard anyone else point that out other than me they were like ollie how how are
[2:56:37.080 --> 2:56:42.520]  they gonna get away with this i said study the french revolution the guillotine was used against
[2:56:42.520 --> 2:56:46.840]  the aristocracy before it was used before the people invented the guillotine exactly claus
[2:56:46.840 --> 2:56:52.600]  wobb says we're creating a revolution they're gonna sit back while we burn it's a demonic sacrifice so
[2:56:52.600 --> 2:56:58.360]  joe biden's in on it and he thinks he's gonna get the proper end on it so when you see this violent
[2:56:58.360 --> 2:57:02.760]  revolution form foment that they call right wing it's not going to actually be right wing it's going
[2:57:02.760 --> 2:57:07.880]  to be a fake right wing and what they will say is well now you guys have your pound of flesh can
[2:57:07.880 --> 2:57:13.160]  we go back to normal and what we will notice is that the corporate oligarchs have a monopoly on
[2:57:13.160 --> 2:57:18.360]  everything still notice that that never changes that never i'm worried about the right wing
[2:57:18.360 --> 2:57:22.440]  backlash to all this oh it's it's entirely fake i mean you know just look at look at some of this
[2:57:22.440 --> 2:57:27.000]  i don't even want to talk about it but in dc a couple days before my hearing they got people
[2:57:27.000 --> 2:57:32.200]  chanting a phrase that the committee is investigating me for i'm like okay this is clearly a sigh up
[2:57:32.200 --> 2:57:38.040]  this is clearly a sigh up so it's all about steel no i'm calling victory or death you know the travis
[2:57:38.040 --> 2:57:42.920]  letter you know hold on we'll back in two minutes final comments with ollie alexander

[2:59:37.880 --> 2:59:43.400]  about reset wars 25 off through christmas day at reset wars dot com get the course now
[2:59:43.400 --> 2:59:53.000]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[3:00:01.640 --> 3:00:05.880]  ali alexander was telling her in the break he expects to hear from the january 6 witch hunt
[3:00:05.880 --> 3:00:14.600]  shy com committee look they don't want me to come out and talk about anything it's not against the
[3:00:14.600 --> 3:00:19.080]  law they didn't inform me that i couldn't talk about anything and still i'm respecting the process
[3:00:19.080 --> 3:00:24.760]  notice i'm not talking about necessarily you know pull quotes or the contents but the look
[3:00:24.760 --> 3:00:30.040]  in the field because the american people deserve this including people on the left again i support
[3:00:30.040 --> 3:00:34.520]  an independent investigation into january 6 because what you're going to find is there's
[3:00:34.520 --> 3:00:39.640]  some bad actors on both sides but you know the idea that that you're going to be for capital
[3:00:39.640 --> 3:00:46.280]  security by repealing the first amendment which by the way is a hillary clinton after citizens united
[3:00:46.920 --> 3:00:52.680]  look that up you know is is preposterous the idea that the fb you know the pipe bombs why aren't
[3:00:52.680 --> 3:00:58.680]  we investigating the pipe bombs those pipe bombs were sent there to attack us in our crowd and yet
[3:00:58.680 --> 3:01:03.880]  it's being phrased as we plant the pipe bombs and so it's like oh wow well it's funny because when
[3:01:03.880 --> 3:01:09.400]  there's a pipe bomb that gave the fbi jurisdiction over the capital interesting so why can't we know
[3:01:09.400 --> 3:01:13.880]  who the fbi was employed employing in the crowd well the goodness is nobody's buying it i want to
[3:01:13.880 --> 3:01:19.000]  give you there's only like a few hundred of these left we save back when i think losers that got them
[3:01:19.000 --> 3:01:22.760]  this if we were able to survive in the next year there's gonna be special stuff or folks that are
[3:01:22.760 --> 3:01:29.800]  members founding member george washington slaying the dragon coin for ollie alexander oh my surprise
[3:01:29.800 --> 3:01:35.960]  gift it is christmas huh absolutely so i appreciate you oh look at that it's good there's only 10
[3:01:35.960 --> 3:01:40.600]  thousand of those we appreciate we got three minutes left closing comments ollie alexander
[3:01:40.600 --> 3:01:47.080]  before paul joseph watson the true mastermind of january 6 takes over i'm joking the joke go ahead
[3:01:47.720 --> 3:01:52.440]  no i think it's it's it's really great to be here with you i've i've missed you know the comradering
[3:01:52.440 --> 3:01:57.880]  the friendship you know that we've built um there's certainly not just a chilling effect on our first
[3:01:57.880 --> 3:02:02.600]  amendment rights but but they eliminated parts of our first amendment rights and when i'm asked
[3:02:02.600 --> 3:02:09.000]  by people of australia and people of united kingdom and people of canada moms and dads and grandmas
[3:02:09.000 --> 3:02:16.200]  and grandpas who are fighting tyranny in their countries when will the u.s protest when you guys
[3:02:16.200 --> 3:02:21.080]  protest it will bring legitimacy to our protest i said you have to understand we're operating in a
[3:02:21.080 --> 3:02:27.800]  different paradigm january 6 was not about trump it wasn't about alex or ollie it was about enforcing
[3:02:27.800 --> 3:02:36.040]  the variant mandatory vaccine dystopian lockdown they knew that they need to go back to a lot of
[3:02:36.040 --> 3:02:40.520]  demonizing opposition yeah and the first amendment you know lawyers will tell you it gives you three
[3:02:40.520 --> 3:02:45.080]  rights i say it gives you four rights and they eliminated those so right now the best organizers
[3:02:45.080 --> 3:02:51.800]  are deplatformed everyone's full of fear as the fbi tackles parents and in pta meetings and then you
[3:02:51.800 --> 3:02:56.440]  got a threat tag where you can't fly you can't travel you can't make money and and and and
[3:02:56.440 --> 3:03:01.400]  leftist groups of the southern primary law center adl are online tracking what sites you visit and
[3:03:01.400 --> 3:03:06.840]  letting you know they're watching you i mean wow that's the real threat there was a government level
[3:03:06.840 --> 3:03:13.080]  hack against the domain registrar that i use so they could get my credit card number my address
[3:03:13.080 --> 3:03:17.640]  in all the domains that i owed and then hand that to the committee is the fbi investigating them no
[3:03:18.360 --> 3:03:23.880]  a government level hack against it's a complete revolution against the people
[3:03:23.880 --> 3:03:29.560]  bingo big corporations and the elites against the people posing like they're an anti-establishment
[3:03:29.560 --> 3:03:33.480]  and i believe these bullies will be defeated andrew breitbart was it the late andrew breitbart
[3:03:34.040 --> 3:03:39.480]  a friend of mine was ahead of his time big government big education big media it's about
[3:03:39.480 --> 3:03:46.040]  the bigs it's about a monopoly that they want on power control over our body over our mind and our
[3:03:46.040 --> 3:03:52.280]  spirit and we've got to resist this now and so that's why oh ali came out of hiding ali is ready
[3:03:52.280 --> 3:04:00.280]  for the final round 2022 is the final round of whether man will be free or man will be a slave

[3:04:04.760 --> 3:04:09.960]  let's see the media ignore this i gave this to the committee they didn't have one question we've
[3:04:09.960 --> 3:04:15.080]  offered it to the fbi maybe we've given it to them and why aren't people tracking down these
[3:04:15.080 --> 3:04:20.600]  agitators that stormed the east side of the capitol why is it reabs being brought in yeah
[3:04:20.600 --> 3:04:26.760]  this is a hocus pocus all right we'll find you on telegram telegram telegram telegram it's an app on

[3:05:23.640 --> 3:05:28.040]  this is nothing less than martial law and one big thing you can do to fight back is to get
[3:05:28.040 --> 3:05:32.520]  high quality ferriday cages many of which are made here in america and are very compliant

[3:06:24.280 --> 3:06:27.480]  you are listening to her joseph watson
[3:06:30.360 --> 3:06:38.600]  your life is the summit news hour in december 21st 2021 and i hate to report it to your folks but
[3:06:38.600 --> 3:06:44.760]  there's bad news bad breaking news and it's the fact that bill gates has had to cancel his christmas
[3:06:44.760 --> 3:06:52.120]  holiday plans because of oh macron he tweets as of about an hour ago just when it seemed like life
[3:06:52.120 --> 3:06:57.960]  would return to normal yes if he wants that we could be entering the worst part of the pandemic
[3:06:57.960 --> 3:07:03.480]  oh macron will hit home for all of us close friends of mine now have it and i've cancelled most of my
[3:07:03.480 --> 3:07:11.800]  holiday plans the world's smallest violin plays he says oh macron is spreading faster than any virus
[3:07:11.800 --> 3:07:17.320]  in history it will soon be in every country in the world the big unknown is how sick oh macron
[3:07:17.320 --> 3:07:24.680]  makes you well no that's not a big unknown because we've got a massive test case a major country that
[3:07:24.680 --> 3:07:31.880]  was infected with oh macron what over six weeks ago now that we can look at that we can extrapolate
[3:07:31.880 --> 3:07:39.720]  data from to prove in triplicate how sick oh macron makes you and in the case of south africa
[3:07:39.720 --> 3:07:45.480]  the answer is not very now you're going to go through this in america over the course of the
[3:07:45.480 --> 3:07:52.200]  next few weeks we've had it slightly earlier because this variant entered the united kingdom
[3:07:52.200 --> 3:07:58.600]  earlier and spread further than it has in the united states and of course all the usual suspects
[3:07:58.600 --> 3:08:04.600]  the ardent lockdown freaks the hysterics the alarmists seized upon it from the very beginning
[3:08:04.600 --> 3:08:10.680]  to try to start the drumbeat for yet another lockdown the same people who were proven spectacularly
[3:08:10.680 --> 3:08:15.800]  wrong during the first lockdown the same people in the united kingdom who were proven spectacularly
[3:08:15.800 --> 3:08:21.400]  wrong when they said that lifting the restrictions back in july would cause six thousand in fact
[3:08:21.400 --> 3:08:27.080]  seven thousand hospitalizations a day it never happened we never went over a thousand those
[3:08:27.080 --> 3:08:35.800]  same people are making the same doomsday predictions once again and they're already being proven wrong
[3:08:35.800 --> 3:08:41.560]  which i'm going to get onto in a second in the context of the uk and london but bill gates is
[3:08:41.560 --> 3:08:47.240]  trying to again whip up the drumbeat for another lockdown for more restrictions in america more
[3:08:47.240 --> 3:08:54.520]  mask mandates and yet we have a test case in the form of south africa which proves the omicron
[3:08:54.520 --> 3:09:01.960]  is as some experts have said nature's natural organic vaccine and could actually be a good thing
[3:09:01.960 --> 3:09:09.800]  in the fact that it's far less severe than delta headline covet 19 hospitalizations in omicron
[3:09:09.800 --> 3:09:18.120]  happy to epicenter south africa fall by 25 percent this is over the course of the last week they've
[3:09:18.120 --> 3:09:23.320]  dropped by 25 percent once again indicating that the variant is milder than previous strains this
[3:09:23.320 --> 3:09:28.520]  is according to the country's national institute for communicable diseases number of people in
[3:09:28.520 --> 3:09:34.680]  hospitals suffering from the virus in south africa has sunk to five thousand six hundred no don't
[3:09:34.680 --> 3:09:40.120]  say that we want it to be this big mean bad monster that will count out everyone into
[3:09:40.120 --> 3:09:47.720]  complying even further and rolling on this never-ending pandemic into a third year but the stats
[3:09:47.720 --> 3:09:53.720]  just on backing it up omicron is not living up to the hype and all the freaks all the triple
[3:09:53.720 --> 3:09:59.720]  maskers are very perturbed about that fact the seven-day rolling average for new infections in
[3:09:59.720 --> 3:10:06.520]  gauteng province which is where johannesburg is located also fell by more than 10 000 it's just
[3:10:06.520 --> 3:10:11.560]  not living up to the hype and yet bill gates is out there saying we don't know you don't know how
[3:10:11.560 --> 3:10:18.280]  severe it is yes we do it's already peaked in london in the uk it's starting to decline you see
[3:10:18.280 --> 3:10:23.160]  the headline there again out south africa the officials there the health authorities who've
[3:10:23.160 --> 3:10:30.280]  told their population to go out and celebrate christmas without fear have also advised the
[3:10:30.280 --> 3:10:34.680]  government the health officials advise them the government to stop track and trace stop
[3:10:34.680 --> 3:10:41.640]  quarantining omicron contacts because most don't experience any symptoms whatsoever it's mild
[3:10:42.280 --> 3:10:47.400]  we have another headline here covid cases continue that's total covid cases including
[3:10:47.400 --> 3:10:55.960]  all their scariots continue to fall significantly in south africa they peaked on december 15th at
[3:10:55.960 --> 3:11:05.960]  26976 every single day after that they have fallen and they continue to fall we see in the early sense
[3:11:05.960 --> 3:11:12.680]  a similar scenario unfolding in london in the uk and this video highlights some of those key points
[3:11:12.680 --> 3:11:19.720]  which is why borris johnson today has had to reject the alarmist the lockdown zealots they were
[3:11:19.720 --> 3:11:25.320]  trying to drumbeat him into announcing another lockdown another cancelled christmas and even
[3:11:25.320 --> 3:11:31.800]  borris johnson has found the cahones to say no to them at least for now because of all the data
[3:11:31.800 --> 3:11:37.800]  that we've had for the past month now showing that this is mild this could actually be a good thing
[3:11:37.800 --> 3:11:44.680]  here is the video omicron fails to live up to expectations let's roll that clip and i'll come
[3:11:44.680 --> 3:11:50.920]  back and talk about it more after the clip here it is omicron continues to be another massive letdown
[3:11:50.920 --> 3:11:56.680]  for those hoping to exploit it to lobby for another uk lockdown the government said we'd be at two
[3:11:56.680 --> 3:12:02.360]  million new corona cases every day by christmas where four days out from christmas the number
[3:12:02.360 --> 3:12:08.760]  today was around 90 000 and that was lower than yesterday borris says omicron cases are surging
[3:12:08.760 --> 3:12:12.840]  but paul hunter professor in medicine at the university of east anglia says omicron infections
[3:12:12.840 --> 3:12:18.360]  in the uk have already peaked borris says a tsunami of cases is coming yet covid cases in
[3:12:18.360 --> 3:12:23.800]  south africa peaked on december 15th and have dropped every day since they tell us omicron will
[3:12:23.800 --> 3:12:29.640]  overwhelm nhs hospitals yet in south africa the epicenter of the omicron outbreak hospitalizations
[3:12:29.640 --> 3:12:36.040]  have dropped by 25 percent over the last week icu emissions are 79 percent lower than the previous
[3:12:36.040 --> 3:12:41.720]  peak again suggesting that omicron is far milder in gauteng province reported infections have been
[3:12:41.720 --> 3:12:46.600]  falling rapidly over the past week danish data shows that people with omicron are both less
[3:12:46.600 --> 3:12:50.760]  likely to be hospitalized than those with other variants and release from the hospital much
[3:12:50.760 --> 3:12:57.640]  more quickly they tell us london is being overwhelmed by omicron really the growth in new cases per day
[3:12:57.640 --> 3:13:02.840]  of omicron in london has crashed they tell us hospitals in london are stretched to the limit
[3:13:02.840 --> 3:13:08.840]  really from this amount of increase in hospitalizations up to 40 percent of new covid admissions
[3:13:08.840 --> 3:13:14.520]  in london are only diagnosed after arriving with another ailment the uk's test positivity rate is
[3:13:14.520 --> 3:13:19.800]  not any higher than it was in october the ons says covid related deaths are at their lowest
[3:13:19.800 --> 3:13:27.400]  level since october all this and borris johnson is still probably about to impose a two week
[3:13:27.400 --> 3:13:33.240]  circuit breaker which will completely cripple the already devastated hospitality industry
[3:13:33.240 --> 3:13:39.160]  and ruin countless more livelihoods the government is still not factoring in the horrendous damage
[3:13:39.160 --> 3:13:45.800]  their restrictions and lockdowns have on society after 22 months of this oh it'll just be for two
[3:13:45.800 --> 3:13:52.200]  weeks though honestly yeah you said that two years ago circuit breaker is just another euphemism
[3:13:52.200 --> 3:13:59.560]  for lockdown but why is he actually reading any of this data read the frigging data data that once
[3:13:59.560 --> 3:14:05.400]  again proves the hysterical alarmist modellers have got it wrong yet again just as they did
[3:14:05.400 --> 3:14:14.200]  on every previous occasion now bear in mind that a few days ago here in the uk as of saturday this
[3:14:14.200 --> 3:14:19.560]  is a headline at the guardian uk scientists bringing curbs now or face up to two million daily
[3:14:19.560 --> 3:14:26.600]  covid infections as amicron spreads they told us there'd be two million new daily cases every
[3:14:26.600 --> 3:14:32.840]  single day of covid by christmas day which is in four days time and they were still saying this
[3:14:32.840 --> 3:14:39.160]  four days ago the official covid case number for today even with all their inflated numbers and
[3:14:39.160 --> 3:14:46.440]  inflated testing and you know within 28 days of testing for it is 90 000 is lower than it was
[3:14:46.440 --> 3:14:53.160]  yesterday it peaked six days ago and almost every day it's gone down there are gonna be two million
[3:14:53.160 --> 3:15:00.280]  new covid cases a day by christmas nowhere near that they lied again they tried to drum beat as
[3:15:00.280 --> 3:15:06.200]  into lockdown based off the back of completely erroneous models that have been proven spectacularly
[3:15:06.200 --> 3:15:11.640]  wrong time and time again in the past and thankfully for once boris hasn't bought it at least for now
[3:15:11.640 --> 3:15:17.080]  now another guardian headline says new year too late for extra covid rules in england
[3:15:17.080 --> 3:15:22.280]  scientists reacted to dismay with boris johnson's decision not to impose fresh restrictions
[3:15:23.000 --> 3:15:27.960]  it goes on to say the rate of growth in infection rates may already have plateaued or fallen by
[3:15:27.960 --> 3:15:33.640]  then like that's a bad thing that the rates have plateaued or fallen that shows you exactly the
[3:15:33.640 --> 3:15:40.120]  true agenda they wanted to get the lockdown in before the rates fell anyway which they were
[3:15:40.120 --> 3:15:46.840]  going to do anyway which all the data out of south africa a mild illness low hospitalization
[3:15:46.840 --> 3:15:52.120]  suggested was going to happen that's happening lockdown zealots are in the mud they're crying
[3:15:52.120 --> 3:15:57.160]  into their beer tonight we'll talk about it on the other side summit dot news why do my enemies hate
[3:15:57.160 --> 3:16:03.720]  me so much why do the globalists take you so much why do they hate america so much because it's an
[3:16:03.720 --> 3:16:10.600]  idea of freedom that their tyrannical system that they're pushing cannot coexist with it's very
[3:16:10.600 --> 3:16:16.920]  very simple for their world government their anti-human post-human eugenics system to flourish
[3:16:17.560 --> 3:16:24.360]  freedom and liberty and due process injustice and god fearing systems must fail so sure you
[3:16:24.360 --> 3:16:29.640]  didn't start a fight with bill gates you didn't start a fight with david rockfeller you didn't
[3:16:29.640 --> 3:16:35.720]  start a fight with the un they started a fight with you and they're not gonna back down and
[3:16:35.720 --> 3:16:41.560]  they're not gonna go away and they're not going to ever stop their attacks until they have the
[3:16:41.560 --> 3:16:46.520]  fear of god put into them the average person still doesn't even know about the new world order or
[3:16:46.520 --> 3:16:51.800]  about globalism or about corporate fascism and it's not until people understand that and that
[3:16:51.800 --> 3:16:57.880]  we're under attack we have any chance of beating these people since the end of world war two the
[3:16:57.880 --> 3:17:02.120]  globalists have been building their private corporate world government whose end game once they get
[3:17:02.120 --> 3:17:08.440]  control is forced depopulation of the planet that's why as we begin to leave the year 2021

[3:19:12.280 --> 3:19:17.960]  no to claus schwaub bill gates and the great reset and so now info wars credibility is stronger than
[3:19:17.960 --> 3:19:23.000]  it's ever been and the globalists are now coming to try to shut us down after all their other attacks
[3:19:23.000 --> 3:19:27.960]  and we can't let them do that so you've invested info wars over the years i'm asking you to
[3:19:27.960 --> 3:19:33.160]  redouble those efforts now at this critical juncture or everything you've done in the past
[3:19:33.160 --> 3:19:38.920]  is for nothing you have invested in justice and the truth and hardcore populace you have done
[3:19:38.920 --> 3:19:45.320]  incredible things and i'm telling you now going in 2022 info wars has major underages

[3:19:54.200 --> 3:20:10.200]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[3:20:15.160 --> 3:20:20.200]  live from the summit dot news headquarters it's paul joseph watson
[3:20:20.200 --> 3:20:29.800]  now of course bill gates isn't going to cancel his holiday it's a giant ruse he owns private jets
[3:20:29.800 --> 3:20:35.720]  he's the biggest owner of farmland in the united states he undoubtedly owns private islands where
[3:20:35.720 --> 3:20:41.160]  he could just fly his own staff out there on a whim and have a holiday away from the rest of the
[3:20:41.160 --> 3:20:48.680]  humanity that he clearly hates this is a p r stun it's a public relations campaign to sow fear and
[3:20:48.680 --> 3:20:54.680]  dread in americans at the height of the holiday season to try and convince them that omicron
[3:20:54.680 --> 3:21:00.680]  is dastardly something to fear something to justify further restrictions mask mandates
[3:21:00.680 --> 3:21:06.040]  lockdowns by the biden administration when all the data from south africa which has been going
[3:21:06.040 --> 3:21:10.680]  through this for six weeks and all the early data from the uk in london which has been going
[3:21:10.680 --> 3:21:15.560]  through this for about a month now shows that it's not deadly it's nothing to be afraid of
[3:21:15.560 --> 3:21:22.200]  the symptoms are mild the symptoms are literally cold symptoms we have a professor here is actually
[3:21:22.200 --> 3:21:27.400]  telling the truth which probably bill gates should read says omicron numbers may have peaked and
[3:21:27.400 --> 3:21:32.680]  lockdown might not be necessary this is in the uk paul hunter professor in medicine at the university
[3:21:32.680 --> 3:21:38.680]  of east anglia said that rapid increase in covid cases appeared to be slowing and that there was no
[3:21:38.680 --> 3:21:43.560]  need for a lockdown if that was shown to be true he said measures measures such as social distancing
[3:21:43.560 --> 3:21:48.600]  and lockdowns never ultimately prevent infection unless eradication is a possibility again they
[3:21:48.600 --> 3:21:54.440]  just kick the can down the road in scotland by the way they've announced today that if you go
[3:21:54.440 --> 3:22:00.680]  to a nightclub you have to remain two meters distant from anyone else in a nightclub good
[3:22:00.680 --> 3:22:06.840]  luck with that i saw an image earlier today in fact my brother sent it to me where there's a gym
[3:22:06.840 --> 3:22:12.680]  with a squash court and it says because of covid 19 you can't you're not allowed to touch the walls
[3:22:12.680 --> 3:22:18.680]  on a squash court have you actually played squash pretty difficult to not touch the walls
[3:22:18.680 --> 3:22:25.560]  so people are still freaking out over this full board total paranoia and yet it's just not bearing
[3:22:25.560 --> 3:22:32.360]  out their alarmism the other thing that's happening in the uk is that everybody has flew in the cold
[3:22:32.360 --> 3:22:39.400]  especially in london yes colds and flu still exist i know the government told you that they
[3:22:39.400 --> 3:22:45.560]  completely eradicate at them last year but yes colds and flu do actually still exist in london
[3:22:45.560 --> 3:22:50.920]  so there's this nasty cold or flu bug going around everyone's got it everyone's freaking out
[3:22:50.920 --> 3:22:56.440]  thinking they've got omicron and they're gonna die because they've been brainwashed into supine
[3:22:56.440 --> 3:23:04.760]  cowards by the mass media and so the test numbers are going parabolic 25 increase in testing for
[3:23:04.760 --> 3:23:11.240]  covid in the uk over the past week or 10 days but then when you look at the test that are positive
[3:23:11.240 --> 3:23:15.480]  the percentage of tests that are positive as the daily skeptic did in this headline
[3:23:17.480 --> 3:23:22.600]  omicron is not surging boris there's a ton more testing and infections are already peaking again
[3:23:22.600 --> 3:23:28.040]  the spike is an artifact of mass testing the percentage of positive tests for covid has
[3:23:28.040 --> 3:23:35.160]  slightly gone up nowhere near the level that they claim necessitates a panic so people have got the
[3:23:35.160 --> 3:23:39.320]  cold they've got the flu they feel ill they think they've got omicron they're all freaking out
[3:23:40.040 --> 3:23:46.600]  people wearing masks outside i've seen triple masks outside in the uk generally people didn't
[3:23:46.600 --> 3:23:53.720]  wear masks outside it was like maybe one in 20 people now it's about 25 so again the public is
[3:23:53.720 --> 3:24:01.240]  terribly terribly brainwashed but it's the flu it's a cold my parents are triple jabbed triple
[3:24:01.240 --> 3:24:07.240]  jabbed they don't listen to me but when they got their booster shot they also got the flu shot in
[3:24:07.240 --> 3:24:13.800]  the other arm at the same time imagine that double shots so they got the flu shot about two weeks ago
[3:24:13.800 --> 3:24:21.720]  they come and visit me i catch this flu bug cold bug then they get it even though they literally
[3:24:21.720 --> 3:24:27.960]  had the flu vaccine a few weeks ago because it works so well keep taking the shots we also
[3:24:27.960 --> 3:24:34.280]  have a situation where the uk government reacted to this dastardly deadly omicron outbreak which is
[3:24:34.280 --> 3:24:41.000]  they say killed 12 people who died with it who probably had like 16 comorbidities and were 84
[3:24:41.000 --> 3:24:48.520]  years old but 12 people they reacted to it by telling the public to go out and attend mass
[3:24:48.520 --> 3:24:54.680]  gatherings in the form of massive queues of hundreds and thousands of people outside of football
[3:24:54.680 --> 3:25:01.720]  stadiums outside of hospitals outside of vaccine injection centers so the government's response
[3:25:01.720 --> 3:25:08.360]  to omicron was not even to tell people to stay home it was to tell them to gather in large groups
[3:25:08.360 --> 3:25:14.040]  in relatively close proximity so they could queue up and get the booster shot we were told the
[3:25:14.040 --> 3:25:18.520]  vaccine the booster shot doesn't really fully protect you against omicron and then we were told
[3:25:18.520 --> 3:25:23.640]  a few days later the solution to omicron was to get the booster shot because that of course makes
[3:25:23.640 --> 3:25:31.480]  perfect sense three mile zero hedge reports some good omicron news symptoms remain extremely mild
[3:25:31.480 --> 3:25:37.080]  uk cases peaking oh no don't say that with the mainstream media scrambling to keep the fear
[3:25:37.080 --> 3:25:41.640]  factor over the omicron factor pegged to the max with much of europe in the process of locking down
[3:25:41.640 --> 3:25:47.880]  oh yeah europe's basically freaked out once again they've cancelled football matches in
[3:25:47.880 --> 3:25:53.880]  scotland they're saying sports teams won't even be able to play in front of spectators new lockdowns
[3:25:53.880 --> 3:26:00.120]  in holland portugal and all these other countries again in response to a variant which is no worse
[3:26:00.120 --> 3:26:06.200]  than the common cold according to all the experts in south africa noting that omicron has spread
[3:26:06.200 --> 3:26:10.280]  like wildfire in london though which in turn has made the uk the country with the most cases per
[3:26:10.280 --> 3:26:15.560]  million people a db strategist asked how does this compare to what was seen in the south african
[3:26:15.560 --> 3:26:23.160]  province of gauteng and again if you look at the graph here it lags behind by about 10 days but the
[3:26:23.160 --> 3:26:29.320]  peak in cases is following the exact same trend line as it did in south africa and it's already
[3:26:29.320 --> 3:26:36.920]  starting to come down in london in the uk as it did in south africa and again i haven't got covid
[3:26:36.920 --> 3:26:43.000]  don't worry i took a test it's just the flu so all the experts or at least the ones that don't get
[3:26:43.000 --> 3:26:46.360]  amplified by the mainstream media say this is nothing to worry about it was nothing to worry
[3:26:46.360 --> 3:26:53.320]  about in south africa bill gates has cancelled his holiday he's actually still going on holiday it's
[3:26:53.320 --> 3:26:59.480]  a complete ruse it's to terrify americans into locking down into wearing masks when they meet
[3:26:59.480 --> 3:27:04.520]  their own family members for christmas dinner into taking tests before they meet their own family
[3:27:04.520 --> 3:27:10.600]  members before christmas dinner and then being denied access to their own relatives houses before
[3:27:10.600 --> 3:27:18.680]  christmas dinner it's all being done to drum up more fear more division more discord don't believe
[3:27:18.680 --> 3:27:25.800]  any of it south africa and indeed now the uk in its early stages has proven that it's alarmist
[3:27:25.800 --> 3:27:34.440]  fear mongering bs i'm going to go on to talk about the vaccine itself now because there was a former
[3:27:34.440 --> 3:27:39.160]  rep if i can pull up the article here it was california democratic rep katie hill
[3:27:40.120 --> 3:27:44.520]  said she's tested positive for covid at eight months pregnant despite being fully vaccinated
[3:27:44.520 --> 3:27:53.480]  and boosted fully masked fully vaccinated covid positive oh but we can't say that anymore twitter's
[3:27:53.480 --> 3:28:00.760]  new rules their new terms of service say you can't say on twitter that the vaccinated can still
[3:28:00.760 --> 3:28:07.960]  spread covid how many stories do we have every day of celebrities who are triple vaccinated
[3:28:07.960 --> 3:28:14.920]  covid positive we had senator elizabeth warren the other day fully masked triple vaccinated
[3:28:14.920 --> 3:28:19.880]  covid positive well now former rep katie hill says she has covid while eight months pregnant
[3:28:19.880 --> 3:28:24.920]  despite being fully vaccinated and receiving a booster she made the announcement on twitter
[3:28:24.920 --> 3:28:32.200]  said she's not suffering from severe symptoms but again should she be allowed to make that
[3:28:32.200 --> 3:28:38.040]  announcement on twitter given that twitter's new terms of service literally say that you can't
[3:28:38.040 --> 3:28:45.080]  say the vaccinated can still spread covid maybe she's lying maybe she's spreading medical misinformation
[3:28:45.080 --> 3:28:50.600]  maybe she's giving out false information from a covid test i don't know but twitter says that's
[3:28:50.600 --> 3:28:58.840]  not possible so i guess it's not possible we'll be back summit dot news well here we are the year
[3:28:58.840 --> 3:29:05.960]  2021 is almost over christmas is just a few days away i want to take a little bit of time out to
[3:29:05.960 --> 3:29:11.640]  thank you all for keeping us in the fight the new world order would have already basically won if it
[3:29:11.640 --> 3:29:17.480]  wasn't for info wars and i'm not bragging i'm letting you know that together as a family we
[3:29:17.480 --> 3:29:21.960]  have changed the world and that we have a responsibility because god put us in this
[3:29:21.960 --> 3:29:27.960]  position to not back down now at the very critical point this is an info war and the
[3:29:27.960 --> 3:29:33.080]  globals are trying to break your will and demoralize you and i produced a two-part course mind war
[3:29:33.080 --> 3:29:38.760]  spirit war six plus hours that lays out the most game changing information ever it's available
[3:29:38.760 --> 3:29:45.320]  right now at reset wars dot com and through christmas day we've extended the sale 25 off so reset

[3:29:57.800 --> 3:30:03.080]  but across the world you see it on the sides of barns and on bumper stickers on cars and
[3:30:03.080 --> 3:30:09.000]  written on the side of bathroom walls alex jones was right that's become a maxim of people to
[3:30:09.000 --> 3:30:12.840]  communicate to others that they see through the fraud of the new world order that they're saying
[3:30:12.840 --> 3:30:18.520]  no to claus schwaab bill gates and the great reset and so now info wars credibility is stronger than
[3:30:18.520 --> 3:30:23.560]  it's ever been and the globalists are now coming to try to shut us down after all their other attacks
[3:30:23.560 --> 3:30:28.440]  and we can't let them do that so you vested info wars over the years i'm asking you to
[3:30:28.440 --> 3:30:33.640]  redouble those efforts now at this critical juncture or everything you've done in the past
[3:30:33.640 --> 3:30:39.080]  is for nothing you have invested in justice and the truth and hardcore populace you have
[3:30:39.080 --> 3:30:45.960]  done incredible things and i'm telling you now going in 2022 info wars has major underages to
[3:30:45.960 --> 3:30:50.920]  run an operation and we need more funds in so it's a 360 win get great products that are great for

[3:30:54.680 --> 3:31:02.120]  i've been fighting as hard as i can for almost 28 years against the globalist i wanted to stop
[3:31:02.120 --> 3:31:07.480]  their agenda i wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went
[3:31:07.480 --> 3:31:13.080]  operational but we failed yes a lot of people are awake yes we're not getting caught flatfooted
[3:31:13.080 --> 3:31:19.080]  but they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization great reset
[3:31:19.080 --> 3:31:23.560]  and that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody
[3:31:23.560 --> 3:31:27.960]  they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth
[3:31:27.960 --> 3:31:31.880]  so we've got an information warfare of the enemy and try to stop their agenda and we've also got
[3:31:31.880 --> 3:31:36.040]  to get personally prepared and one of the number one things to do is high quality storeable food

[3:33:25.080 --> 3:33:37.240]  broadcasting internationally from the summit dot news headquarters in the united kingdom
[3:33:37.240 --> 3:33:45.960]  it's paul joseph watson one of the uh plan b restrictions that they introduced a couple
[3:33:45.960 --> 3:33:53.400]  of weeks ago here in the uk based off of absolutely nothing was of course covid passports for events
[3:33:53.400 --> 3:33:59.400]  such as sporting events at sports stadiums nightclubs music events and other events such as that
[3:33:59.400 --> 3:34:04.840]  of course planning long term to expand that to other venues if we don't get it defeated if we
[3:34:04.840 --> 3:34:10.040]  don't get it kicked out quickly well now the french health minister has acknowledged that
[3:34:10.040 --> 3:34:17.000]  vaccine passports far from their primary purpose being to stop the spread of the virus which of
[3:34:17.000 --> 3:34:23.000]  course is a complete misnomer because twitter is wrong the vaccinated can and indeed do spread
[3:34:23.000 --> 3:34:32.200]  the virus he says there in fact a quote disguised vaccine mandate this is the french minister of
[3:34:32.200 --> 3:34:36.600]  health who has admitted the vaccine passports are a disguised form of mandatory vaccines despite
[3:34:36.600 --> 3:34:42.840]  president macron claiming vaccine mandates will not be compulsory well they'll just ruin your life
[3:34:42.840 --> 3:34:49.240]  they'll crush your livelihood they'll eliminate your relationships your ability to go out and
[3:34:49.240 --> 3:34:55.080]  meet other people even long term your ability to buy food as we've seen in newt brunswick in
[3:34:55.080 --> 3:34:59.960]  canada and in queensland in australia now they're now literally giving the power to the supermarkets
[3:34:59.960 --> 3:35:04.840]  to ban the unvaccinated from being able to get in and feed themselves very tolerant
[3:35:05.880 --> 3:35:11.400]  in comments reported by french broadcaster lechand info oliver verran revealed that the
[3:35:11.400 --> 3:35:17.240]  primary purpose of the country's covid pass scheme was to force the unvaccinated to cave in
[3:35:17.240 --> 3:35:23.800]  he said quote the vax pass is a disguised form of vaccination obligation but it's more effective
[3:35:23.800 --> 3:35:29.960]  and again in france they've said they're going to eliminate the option for a negative test
[3:35:30.680 --> 3:35:34.920]  so the option to provide a negative test proving that you don't have covid before entering a
[3:35:34.920 --> 3:35:41.640]  venue will be eliminated ensuring therefore that only the vaccinated who can still transmit the
[3:35:41.640 --> 3:35:46.040]  virus catch the virus will be allowed into the venue so if you can literally prove on the spot
[3:35:46.040 --> 3:35:51.640]  that you don't have the virus you're not allowed in he says preventing people from going to bars
[3:35:51.640 --> 3:35:55.640]  restaurants places that receive the public if they're not vaccinated is more effective than
[3:35:55.640 --> 3:36:01.080]  finding them 100 euros when caught in the street in other words making life miserable for the
[3:36:01.080 --> 3:36:07.960]  unvax is the best way of forcing them to get vaccinated he admitted it very candid comments
[3:36:08.920 --> 3:36:14.840]  meanwhile airline ceo calls for the unvaccinated idiots to be ostracized from society this is the
[3:36:14.840 --> 3:36:20.280]  ceo of ryan air michael o'leary who by the way is a bilderberg member who's part of the part of
[3:36:20.280 --> 3:36:25.320]  the club part of davos part of the globally elite part of the great reset he's declared that anyone
[3:36:25.320 --> 3:36:29.880]  who remains unvaccinated should be completely cut off from society including not being allowed to
[3:36:29.880 --> 3:36:35.320]  travel go to the supermarket to get food or the pharmacy to get medicine if you're not vaccinated
[3:36:35.320 --> 3:36:38.520]  shouldn't be allowed in the hospital you shouldn't be allowed to fly you shouldn't be allowed on the
[3:36:38.520 --> 3:36:43.240]  london underground you shouldn't be allowed in the local supermarket or your pharmacy either i guess
[3:36:43.240 --> 3:36:48.600]  you could just die he says you could sit at home and you know get your deliveries of medicines and
[3:36:48.600 --> 3:36:53.880]  food oh how gracious of him but you should not you know go to work or go on public transport
[3:36:53.880 --> 3:37:01.160]  unless you have a vaccine certificate because i mean they work so well they work so well as we
[3:37:01.160 --> 3:37:06.120]  know twitter told us twitter told us that the vaccinated can't spread the virus even though
[3:37:06.120 --> 3:37:12.280]  there's literally countless examples of it on an hour by hour basis the japanese government
[3:37:12.280 --> 3:37:17.640]  meanwhile has taken a very different approach it's told its citizens quote don't discriminate against
[3:37:17.640 --> 3:37:23.400]  the unvaccinated despite numerous major countries making covid-19 vaccine mandatory japanese government
[3:37:23.400 --> 3:37:29.800]  has told its citizens don't discriminate against the unvaxxed this was posted on the website for
[3:37:29.800 --> 3:37:36.520]  the ministry of health labor and welfare where it appealed to employers as well not to discriminate
[3:37:36.520 --> 3:37:43.560]  not to force vaccination on their staff the prime minister's website also contains a similar statement
[3:37:44.200 --> 3:37:49.720]  meanwhile in austria they're hiring people the government is about to pay people to quote hunt
[3:37:49.720 --> 3:37:57.640]  down vaccine refusers the burden for enforcing the fines on adjapt austrians which is by the way
[3:37:57.640 --> 3:38:03.720]  about four thousand euros rising to eight thousand euros they double it every single time they're not
[3:38:03.720 --> 3:38:09.240]  going to cart you off to a vaccination gulag to forcibly inject you but if you don't pay the
[3:38:09.240 --> 3:38:16.840]  fines which no person who earns a reasonable amount of income can possibly pay they will forcibly
[3:38:16.840 --> 3:38:22.840]  cart you off to prison so i guess that's fine the city of linds which is home to two hundred
[3:38:22.840 --> 3:38:28.440]  thousand inhabitants has a relatively low vaccination rate of 63 percent so now the government there
[3:38:28.440 --> 3:38:33.880]  is responded by saying they'll hire an army of inspectors whose job it will be to check on
[3:38:33.880 --> 3:38:39.800]  whether those who do not get vaccinated really pay for it and in this job advertisement it said
[3:38:39.800 --> 3:38:46.040]  that one of the requirements would be for these vaccine refuse nick hunters to be able to work
[3:38:46.040 --> 3:38:54.040]  a lot of overtime let's go to this clip though now because in sweden there's a new microchip which
[3:38:54.040 --> 3:39:00.120]  conveniently stores your covid-19 vaccination status and i'm sure that this won't be used for
[3:39:00.120 --> 3:39:05.320]  the rollout of a complete dystopia the likes of which would make all well role in his grave
[3:39:05.320 --> 3:39:11.080]  let's go to the clip here it is there's a new implantable microchip that's so convenient to
[3:39:11.080 --> 3:39:17.000]  store your covid-19 vaccination data in sweden increasing numbers of people have implanted
[3:39:17.000 --> 3:39:23.160]  microchips with proof of their vaccination into their hands since the nation announced new covid
[3:39:23.160 --> 3:39:29.160]  restrictions when scanned all of a person's information about their vaccination status is
[3:39:29.160 --> 3:39:35.000]  shown on a reader or phone now this isn't a promo for a new series of black mirror it's a very real
[3:39:35.000 --> 3:39:40.040]  product created by swedish company epicenter clip shows the company's chief distribution
[3:39:40.040 --> 3:39:44.680]  officer waving his implanted arm over a smartphone which then displays his vaccination status and
[3:39:44.680 --> 3:39:49.320]  if you think billions of people around the world won't gleefully sign up for this having been
[3:39:49.320 --> 3:39:53.880]  suitably terrified at the prospect of some godawful new threat then you must have been living
[3:39:53.880 --> 3:39:58.840]  under a rock for the past 18 months it's not as if any of this is even hidden anymore great reset
[3:39:58.840 --> 3:40:04.200]  pioneer and 21st century doctor strange love claus schwaab himself wrote about all this in
[3:40:04.200 --> 3:40:08.440]  his own book shaping the future of the fourth industrial revolution quote some of us already
[3:40:08.440 --> 3:40:13.320]  feel that our smartphones have become an extension of ourselves today's external devices from wearable
[3:40:13.320 --> 3:40:17.640]  computers to virtual reality headsets will almost certainly become implantable in our bodies and
[3:40:17.640 --> 3:40:23.160]  brains don't forget some governments are now giving supermarkets the power to ban the unvaccinated no
[3:40:23.160 --> 3:40:29.880]  jab no food and maybe in a few years no microchip no food the leader of uk's implant firm biotech
[3:40:29.880 --> 3:40:35.720]  steven northon believes implants are going to be mainstream in the next decade quote in 10 to 15
[3:40:35.720 --> 3:40:41.320]  years microchip humans will be an everyday occurrence remember those crazy old-time conspiracy
[3:40:41.320 --> 3:40:47.560]  theorists who used to bang on about revelations the mark of the beast not being allowed to buy or sell
[3:40:47.560 --> 3:40:52.920]  without taking it remember how everyone laughed at their alarmist paranoia for decades on end
[3:40:52.920 --> 3:41:00.760]  but it's not so funny now is it there you have it and of course with the cashless society which is
[3:41:00.760 --> 3:41:08.040]  advanced in no greater place than sweden everything increasingly is done being done by qr codes maybe
[3:41:08.040 --> 3:41:12.760]  if they just disallow your right to use a qr code to use a smartphone to have a bank account and that
[3:41:12.760 --> 3:41:19.160]  will be tied into that as well as the cashless society grows the microchip becomes the only
[3:41:19.160 --> 3:41:24.840]  form of payment accepted and again the old timers were right it is literally the mark of the beast
[3:41:25.400 --> 3:41:31.000]  meanwhile xpro calls for investigation into football as suffering heart problems another
[3:41:31.000 --> 3:41:35.400]  thing that apparently doesn't exist this is former england football and matt latissier who
[3:41:35.400 --> 3:41:40.440]  was called for an investigation into the spate of sportsmen and athletes collapsing with some
[3:41:40.440 --> 3:41:45.960]  heart problems asserting is not an anti-vaxion just wants more information and they wonder
[3:41:45.960 --> 3:41:53.320]  every single day i see stories oh only 86 percent of premier league footballers in the uk have been
[3:41:53.320 --> 3:41:57.880]  vaccinated there are so many footballers who are not getting vaccinated they're so selfish
[3:41:58.440 --> 3:42:04.200]  well maybe ask something to do with the fact that every single week now we see multiple
[3:42:04.200 --> 3:42:10.280]  young fit healthy athletes peak physical condition know what they want to put in the body they've
[3:42:10.280 --> 3:42:15.880]  made a mistake in putting something in their body there but their peak physical condition
[3:42:15.880 --> 3:42:20.520]  their top athletes plan at the top of their game and yet they're just mysteriously suddenly
[3:42:20.520 --> 3:42:26.600]  collapsing everywhere with heart problems with breathing problems three more in the past week
[3:42:26.600 --> 3:42:32.680]  as we point out in this article you see one of them there so leticia has come out and said
[3:42:32.680 --> 3:42:38.920]  quote it's been very concerning for me watching the sport i love and played for 17 years in all
[3:42:38.920 --> 3:42:44.840]  that time that i played i never once saw any footballer lead the pitch because of heart issues
[3:42:44.840 --> 3:42:52.360]  this is a very rare phenomenon or it was up until last year now it's very common gee i wonder why
[3:42:52.360 --> 3:42:58.920]  we'll be back to submit our news since the end of world war two the globalist have been building
[3:42:58.920 --> 3:43:04.680]  their private corporate world government whose end game once they get control is forced depopulation
[3:43:04.680 --> 3:43:10.600]  of the planet that's why as we begin to leave the year 2021 and go into 2022 i am encouraging all

[3:46:15.960 --> 3:46:21.160]  male vitality really really works it's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have
[3:46:21.160 --> 3:46:27.400]  never been heated up and so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also
[3:46:27.400 --> 3:46:32.200]  work quite well but just aren't as strong this is like a very fine wine it's it's it's in fact
[3:46:32.200 --> 3:46:36.040]  each batch is different sometimes it's super strong sometimes it's just okay people like
[3:46:36.040 --> 3:46:39.480]  why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong that's just how
[3:46:39.480 --> 3:46:45.400]  it is it's how it works uh so it's always good it's just sometimes it's like super strong but
[3:46:45.400 --> 3:46:49.240]  yeah if you want the rolls Royce at a decent price then this is it
[3:46:49.240 --> 3:46:55.080]  um
[3:46:58.040 --> 3:47:04.040]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[3:47:04.040 --> 3:47:17.880]  you're listening to the summit dot news radio hour with paul joseph watson
[3:47:19.880 --> 3:47:26.280]  i want to get to a couple of final videos here in the last segment and we've had one about a
[3:47:26.280 --> 3:47:35.240]  great reset of course this has been percolating for about two years now since the start of the pandemic
[3:47:35.240 --> 3:47:40.760]  the world economic forum all the top technocrats and globalists repeatedly calling for the covid-19
[3:47:40.760 --> 3:47:47.560]  panic to be exploited to create the great reset the media coming back and saying it's a conspiracy
[3:47:47.560 --> 3:47:52.920]  theory it doesn't exist or it does a kind of exist but if you say it's a bad thing then suddenly it
[3:47:52.920 --> 3:47:58.120]  doesn't exist here is the great reset still a conspiracy there are new documents that have
[3:47:58.120 --> 3:48:03.800]  come out in the past couple of days once again proving that this is very real and the world
[3:48:03.800 --> 3:48:08.600]  economic forum works hand in hand with national governments to make sure they're pushing the
[3:48:08.600 --> 3:48:16.360]  consensus for the creation of a great reset here's the video so according to the new york times
[3:48:16.360 --> 3:48:21.320]  a baseless conspiracy theory that proclamation was made after canadian prime minister just
[3:48:21.320 --> 3:48:27.560]  intrude oh said this pandemic has provided an opportunity for a reset this is our chance to
[3:48:27.560 --> 3:48:33.400]  accelerate our pre-pandemic efforts to reimagine economic systems that actually address global
[3:48:33.400 --> 3:48:39.080]  challenges like extreme poverty inequality and climate change and on the very same day that the
[3:48:39.080 --> 3:48:45.080]  world economic forum celebrated the great reset as a way to build future resilience to global risks
[3:48:45.080 --> 3:48:49.240]  and the day before john carrey said the great reset was needed to stop the rise of populism so if
[3:48:49.240 --> 3:48:54.840]  you suggest the great reset is a bad thing it's a conspiracy theory and doesn't exist but if you
[3:48:54.840 --> 3:49:01.240]  champion the great reset as a good thing suddenly it does exist and it's the best thing ever new
[3:49:01.240 --> 3:49:06.120]  letters have been made public after a freedom of information act request in the netherlands
[3:49:06.120 --> 3:49:11.480]  sent to members of the dutch government by the world economic forum inviting them to last year's
[3:49:11.480 --> 3:49:18.760]  davos the letters state the discussions will focus on shaping policies for the post-covid-19 era under
[3:49:18.760 --> 3:49:23.960]  the theme of the great reset your contributions to the work of the great reset will be especially

[3:49:53.240 --> 3:50:00.040]  becomes a major force in shaping the great reset that's a lot of great resets for it to just be
[3:50:00.040 --> 3:50:05.560]  as the new york times claimed a baseless conspiracy theory as soon as the topics started trending
[3:50:05.560 --> 3:50:10.040]  twitter panicked and called in the fact checkers trending in the united kingdom the great reset
[3:50:10.040 --> 3:50:14.760]  the great reset is a sustainability plan pitched in response to the pandemic by the world economic
[3:50:14.760 --> 3:50:19.080]  forum the plan designed to reduce inequality aims to revamp all aspects of global societies and
[3:50:19.080 --> 3:50:23.080]  economies from education climate policies to social contracts and working conditions according to
[3:50:23.080 --> 3:50:28.920]  rogers and bbc he thinks now doth protest too much yeah a few things they missed there the very
[3:50:28.920 --> 3:50:34.920]  architect of the great reset claus schwaub of the world economic forum was called for risk assessment
[3:50:34.920 --> 3:50:39.160]  brain scans before you're allowed to travel implantable chips that read people's thoughts
[3:50:39.160 --> 3:50:43.880]  minority report style pre-crime programs and of course the overarching agenda and
[3:50:43.880 --> 3:50:49.480]  encapsulated by the great reset which is based around dismantling the current capitalist system
[3:50:49.480 --> 3:50:55.880]  in favor of a greater centralized technocratic control which will lead to lower living standards
[3:50:55.880 --> 3:51:01.800]  less fuel consumption you owning nothing and being happy about it the accelerated automation
[3:51:01.800 --> 3:51:06.760]  of jobs and the complete evisceration of civil liberties much of this agenda is discussed in
[3:51:06.760 --> 3:51:13.560]  claus schwaub's books one of which is literally called covid 19 the great reset but i guess those
[3:51:13.560 --> 3:51:21.560]  all just contain baseless conspiracy theories and don't exist either well there you have it and
[3:51:21.560 --> 3:51:26.360]  another thing that of course we know doesn't exist is just covid 19 vaccine side effects
[3:51:26.360 --> 3:51:31.880]  telegraph reports covid vaccines linked to disrupted menstrual cycles in young women
[3:51:31.880 --> 3:51:37.720]  norwegian study finds this is something that i was being told right at the start last year
[3:51:37.720 --> 3:51:43.080]  that this was happening coronavirus vaccines are linked to slightly slightly just slightly
[3:51:43.080 --> 3:51:47.080]  disrupted menstrual cycles in young women especially heavier periods according to a
[3:51:47.080 --> 3:51:52.680]  norwegian study researchers at norwegian institute of public health asked 6 000 women aged between
[3:51:52.680 --> 3:51:57.880]  18 30 about their menstrual cycles and bleeding patterns before and after receiving a covid 19
[3:51:57.880 --> 3:52:07.720]  jab we found that 37.8 percent reported a disorder with their menstrual cycle hardly small fry numbers
[3:52:07.720 --> 3:52:13.640]  is it another unfortunate side effect of the vaccine is that it kills some people zero hedge
[3:52:13.640 --> 3:52:18.600]  reports death of 26 year old new zealand man linked to Pfizer vaccine surely not just when
[3:52:18.600 --> 3:52:22.920]  Pfizer and Moderna were pumping out thought about the omicron variant alongside obviously optimistic
[3:52:22.920 --> 3:52:26.040]  data about the efficacy of their vaccines which of course now you're going to need
[3:52:26.040 --> 3:52:31.480]  200 of the word has come out of new zealand authorities they're linked death of 26 year
[3:52:31.480 --> 3:52:37.080]  old man to the vaccine i'm going to move on though now because i've got one more video i want to come
[3:52:37.080 --> 3:52:45.960]  to which is twitch actually enforcing their terms of service fairly against streamers on the left
[3:52:45.960 --> 3:52:49.960]  as they've been doing against streamers on the right as youtube twitter etc have been
[3:52:49.960 --> 3:52:55.160]  censoring and banning people on the right for what the past six seven years now they finally
[3:52:55.160 --> 3:53:01.560]  enforce their own terms of service against left-wing streamers this clip talks about it here it is
[3:53:06.280 --> 3:53:11.240]  widespread shock as a social media platform actually enforces its own rules against leftists
[3:53:11.240 --> 3:53:16.520]  without giving them unfair exemptions amazon owned twitch has permanently banned vowsh and given
[3:53:16.520 --> 3:53:22.840]  hassan piker a one-week suspension for repeatedly using the c word slur twitch includes the c word
[3:53:22.840 --> 3:53:27.720]  in their harmful slurs or symbols list piker argued that the word was acceptable to use because
[3:53:27.720 --> 3:53:33.560]  there's no historical or contemporary oppression against whites that is aside from the very
[3:53:33.560 --> 3:53:39.080]  contemporary fact that anti-white vitriol is prevalent at every level of society from corporate
[3:53:39.080 --> 3:53:45.080]  media to social media where twitter literally hosts spaces called why do white people exist from
[3:53:45.080 --> 3:53:50.440]  hollywoods enforced diversity through the exaltation of the browning of america and the feverish
[3:53:50.440 --> 3:53:55.320]  celebration of the demographic decline of white people to the fact that anti-white brainwashing
[3:53:55.320 --> 3:54:00.920]  literally riddles the education system in the form of crt that's why everyone's so shocked that
[3:54:00.920 --> 3:54:07.160]  twitch took any action because the only contemporary acceptable form of racism the kind that in 99
[3:54:07.160 --> 3:54:12.760]  percent of circumstances won't get you banned off any major platform is that directed against white
[3:54:12.760 --> 3:54:17.720]  people do i think people should be banned from streaming because they said an offensive word no
[3:54:17.720 --> 3:54:22.440]  but i'm gonna defend piker and vowsh to people who have repeatedly called for others to be
[3:54:22.440 --> 3:54:28.120]  de-platformed when they get de-platformed no i have zero sympathy just like i didn't care when
[3:54:28.120 --> 3:54:34.040]  navara media got banned for about five minutes despite a deluge of cringe conservatives rushing
[3:54:34.040 --> 3:54:38.680]  to their defense and helping them get reinstated they're by coming to the aid of the very same
[3:54:38.680 --> 3:54:44.040]  people who lobby for them to be silenced on a regular basis vowsh celebrated when mollin you
[3:54:44.040 --> 3:54:49.400]  got banned he called for steven crowded to be banned piker also lobbied jack dorsey to ban
[3:54:49.400 --> 3:54:54.680]  kandis owens and they'll both behave exactly the same whenever they ban me i mean come on if i so
[3:54:54.680 --> 3:55:00.440]  much as even started an account on twitch they ban me before i was even able to make one broadcast
[3:55:00.440 --> 3:55:04.680]  vowsh will probably just get reinstated by the end of the week anyway that's what normally happens
[3:55:04.680 --> 3:55:08.920]  and i'm sure piker missing out on a whole week's worth of super chats won't really put much of a
[3:55:08.920 --> 3:55:14.760]  dent in his multimillion dollar mansion buying bank account it seems despite both their fanatical
[3:55:14.760 --> 3:55:19.400]  vehemence in amplifying regime narratives to the point where vowsh now literally defends the
[3:55:19.400 --> 3:55:25.880]  morality of global cia interventionism like some kind of bush era neocon the regime is now ready
[3:55:25.880 --> 3:55:30.440]  to dispense with them anyway why they need to rely on left-wing live streamers to socially
[3:55:30.440 --> 3:55:35.240]  re-engineer the kids when they're now doing it at the high school level anyway but again
[3:55:35.240 --> 3:55:40.680]  no sympathy if you spend years helping giant corporations establish a power monopoly on who's
[3:55:40.680 --> 3:55:46.520]  allowed to engage in free speech shock i'm crying to me when those same behemoths you helped empower
[3:55:46.520 --> 3:55:53.880]  decide to turn the lights out on you now i'm going to get to a final news story here because again
[3:55:53.880 --> 3:55:59.880]  it's another example of how political correctness isn't just being nice to people it literally kills
[3:55:59.880 --> 3:56:05.320]  this is a story out the uk great grandparents of baby girl murdered by lesbian couple warned social
[3:56:05.320 --> 3:56:12.520]  services but were told that they were racist and homophobic this was a 16 month old toddler called
[3:56:12.520 --> 3:56:19.240]  star hobson who was violently abused by this lesbian couple one of whom was a gypsy they swung
[3:56:19.240 --> 3:56:25.160]  her around by the legs they hit her in the face during one social service visit the kid the toddler
[3:56:25.160 --> 3:56:31.480]  even walked into a sofa because it was still disorientated from being abused again being raised
[3:56:31.480 --> 3:56:38.040]  by a 20 year old and a 28 year old lesbian couple daily mail reports social workers investigate the
[3:56:38.040 --> 3:56:45.560]  couple who killed the baby even declared a referral to them as malicious five different
[3:56:45.560 --> 3:56:52.040]  sets of people complained about how this couple was abusing this baby the grandparents of the
[3:56:52.040 --> 3:56:58.200]  baby specifically complained and what did the social services come back with well they ignored
[3:56:58.200 --> 3:57:03.240]  a total of five separate warnings from different people before labeling the great grandparents
[3:57:03.240 --> 3:57:09.480]  who complained homophobic and racist because apparently if you're lesbians or if you're gypsies
[3:57:09.480 --> 3:57:15.000]  you can just abuse and murder kids and get away with it without any intervention whatsoever
[3:57:15.000 --> 3:57:22.040]  meanwhile we've had stories before where adoption couples who have got exemplary records but for
[3:57:22.040 --> 3:57:27.800]  example they support you kid they voted for a right wing party once in their history literally
[3:57:27.800 --> 3:57:34.440]  get the kid snatched away at the first available opportunity despite treating them very well
[3:57:34.440 --> 3:57:40.520]  meanwhile this lesbian couple because they were gay because they were gypsies abuse was ignored
[3:57:40.520 --> 3:57:48.360]  grandparents were called racist that's going to wrap it up so not news reset wars.com is the
[3:57:48.360 --> 3:57:53.640]  coordinates on the internet where you can find the most important information i've produced
[3:57:53.640 --> 3:58:01.560]  in 28 years on air a lot of what's in the courses is known a lot isn't but it's my particular
[3:58:01.560 --> 3:58:07.400]  perspective in my definitions and my way of seeing the world doesn't mean it's perfectly right as the
[3:58:07.400 --> 3:58:12.760]  bible says we all see through a rose color darkly but we've proven that we've got some of the clearest
[3:58:12.760 --> 3:58:18.920]  cutting-edge discernment out there and i want you to have access this information because you need
[3:58:18.920 --> 3:58:24.760]  these tools in my experience at least to stand for the globalists and not let them break your will
[3:58:24.760 --> 3:58:32.600]  and so through christmas day the course is 25 percent off at reset wars.com and it's not just
[3:58:32.600 --> 3:58:38.040]  an amazing game changing consciousness raising course it also funds the info war so it's a true

[3:58:48.040 --> 3:58:53.800]  that i released my seminal film in game blueprint for global enslavement and in that documentary i
[3:58:53.800 --> 3:58:59.480]  predicted the globalists would establish world government by releasing a virus demanding that
[3:58:59.480 --> 3:59:05.080]  there be worldwide lockdowns and then triggering a collapse of our industrial society and now they've
[3:59:05.080 --> 3:59:11.000]  done it how did i know they would do it because they wrote books and white papers and many of their
[3:59:11.000 --> 3:59:16.200]  own reports and internal meetings were leaked you see then i was tracking the builder group who's
[3:59:16.200 --> 3:59:21.560]  head at the time was claus schwa and our sources in cyber confirming to us that they were indeed
[3:59:21.560 --> 3:59:26.840]  planning to launch this great reset well we're now living in it the purposeful collapse of the
[3:59:26.840 --> 3:59:32.040]  third world and the first world on its ass is a tyrannical corporate world government the total
