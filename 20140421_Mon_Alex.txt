[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:20.800]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.800 --> 00:32.200]  well a lot has obviously happened over the weekend and we're live ladies and
[00:32.200 --> 00:39.400]  gentlemen thank you so much for joining us on this Monday the 21st day already of
[00:39.400 --> 00:45.080]  April 2014 again I am your host Alex Jones we're going to be opening the
[00:45.080 --> 00:49.880]  phones up in the first hour today I'm gonna make myself do that we're going to
[00:49.880 --> 00:53.640]  cover just the waterfront of incredibly important news but I'm gonna be
[00:53.640 --> 00:57.440]  getting back into the whole Bundy situation because they're set to have
[00:57.440 --> 01:01.320]  Senate hearings now that Harry Reid's gonna push and they are going to
[01:01.320 --> 01:07.520]  obviously try to develop some plan to create a new standoff because the feds
[01:07.520 --> 01:13.320]  run by their foreign owners the federal occupiers of the country cannot have an
[01:13.320 --> 01:18.160]  example of one aunt standing up because if you let one aunt stand up they might
[01:18.160 --> 01:23.440]  all stand up and you have a Congress with a 6% approval rating saying it's
[01:23.440 --> 01:26.980]  above the law you have the Bell of Rights and Constitution being butchered
[01:26.980 --> 01:32.280]  from one end of the other you have open rise of paramilitary federalized
[01:32.280 --> 01:38.360]  police being trained for open war this is an illegitimate government this is
[01:38.360 --> 01:47.120]  not the Republic of the United States this is a criminal orgy a criminal move
[01:47.120 --> 01:53.000]  to take over society and it's not until we realize that and admit that that we're
[01:53.000 --> 01:56.480]  gonna turn society around so when I do open the phones up I'll give the number
[01:56.480 --> 02:02.840]  out in the next segment I want to hear from you first-time callers I want to
[02:02.840 --> 02:06.500]  hear from you we haven't called in a year you can call that a first-time
[02:06.500 --> 02:14.400]  caller I want to hear from you on how much will we take is there any amount
[02:14.400 --> 02:21.960]  of abuse that we shouldn't lay down to is there any amount of abuse that we
[02:21.960 --> 02:26.400]  should ever stand up to and obviously the answer in your gut and common sense
[02:26.400 --> 02:29.360]  is of course you have a right to do to stand up but then there's a larger
[02:29.360 --> 02:35.600]  question how do you do that smartly because politically we're really
[02:35.600 --> 02:40.080]  starting to have an effect right now and I don't want a physical war to break
[02:40.080 --> 02:44.520]  out I really meditated on that by meditated I don't mean like some
[02:44.520 --> 02:48.880]  yogi but spent a lot of time this weekend in quiet reflection on the
[02:48.880 --> 02:52.320]  Bundy situation and I'm going to share some of my views on that today but I'll
[02:52.320 --> 02:56.920]  tell you right now thank God no violence broke out the Bundy's and their
[02:56.920 --> 03:01.280]  supporters are in the right clearly but that doesn't mean that we should just go
[03:01.280 --> 03:05.720]  ahead and have a civil war start Americans have every right to start
[03:05.720 --> 03:09.520]  physically fighting back I think we crossed that Rubicon a long time ago the
[03:09.520 --> 03:16.280]  question is is that smart and I think the answer is no in fact I know it's not
[03:16.280 --> 03:21.560]  smart to have a physical confrontation a because the people we're going to be
[03:21.560 --> 03:26.680]  fighting are the minions be it's going to give the globalist the crisis they
[03:26.680 --> 03:31.120]  need to try to cause a political physical crackdown that they don't have the
[03:31.120 --> 03:37.280]  political support for right now so keep your powder dry folks but I think not
[03:37.280 --> 03:42.640]  getting into a civil war is obviously the way we want to go here I know for
[03:42.640 --> 03:46.840]  most of you are like tell us something we don't know Alex well the media the
[03:46.840 --> 03:51.320]  control corporate media is going to spin it at the American people if you
[03:51.320 --> 03:53.640]  don't if you don't agree with anything the government's doing you're a terrorist
[03:53.640 --> 03:58.640]  and so they're branding all descent is terrorism so at a certain point as they
[03:58.640 --> 04:02.920]  start coming after us anyways and saying we're terrorists are saying I want
[04:02.920 --> 04:06.480]  violence or saying I'm behind the Boston bombing we have that Rachel Matt
[04:06.480 --> 04:11.840]  Alclep we have the MSNBC clip you're saying that I'm involved the Boston
[04:11.840 --> 04:16.720]  bombing quote deeply racist I have no connection to that no one can say I have
[04:16.720 --> 04:21.120]  a connection to that but they ran AP articles saying that the brothers were
[04:21.120 --> 04:26.280]  both Alex Jones fans well the brothers were both patsies so when I exposed it
[04:26.280 --> 04:34.400]  was really behind it their answer was to say that it was my fault you see so it's
[04:34.400 --> 04:39.800]  it's a complex issue we should have a debate about it but let me tell you the
[04:39.800 --> 04:44.480]  globalist are geared up with Homeland Security they want a civil war I think
[04:44.480 --> 04:47.880]  we should not give it to them but at the same time you've got to admire people
[04:47.880 --> 04:52.040]  who stand up and walk up against Feds with guns on them so we're gonna shoot you
[04:52.040 --> 04:56.480]  if you cross that line the people cross that line that's epic we're gonna be
[04:56.480 --> 05:01.680]  right back on the other side stay with Alex Jones here to tell you about how
[05:01.680 --> 05:05.320]  you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to

[09:21.000 --> 09:25.960]  breaks silent on Pat Tillman death I may have killed him very curious to have
[09:25.960 --> 09:32.200]  this quote whistleblower come out mr. Elliott because well there's a problem
[09:32.200 --> 09:37.520]  we have what the coroner say and what came out in the second inquest and there
[09:37.520 --> 09:42.480]  was a cover-up and he was shot at a distance and then shot up close with a
[09:42.480 --> 09:50.240]  triple burst from some type of m4 carbine in the face so he was killed up
[09:50.240 --> 09:55.600]  close and reportedly begged for his life kept saying you know I'm Pat Tillman I'm
[09:55.600 --> 09:59.800]  Pat Tillman you idiots and they kept shooting him behind the rock so very
[09:59.800 --> 10:03.920]  interesting and I don't even know sergeant bigs Joe Biggs take on that so

[10:20.880 --> 10:26.400]  military base that they've built on the east coast that we covered a few months
[10:26.400 --> 10:31.280]  ago where they've got models of churches and things to be rated and then a
[10:31.280 --> 10:36.400]  model of the DC subway and things I think that's something important to
[10:36.400 --> 10:42.680]  cover but all that is basically an on-air brainstorm of ideas as you know
[10:42.680 --> 10:47.680]  ladies and gentlemen it broke last Friday ah yes there's the headline US
[10:47.680 --> 10:52.080]  Army builds fake city in Virginia to practice military occupation martial law
[10:52.080 --> 10:58.200]  training 300 acre town includes sports stadium school underground subway and
[10:58.200 --> 11:02.600]  there's a new article out by Curt Nemo that's short but extremely powerful
[11:02.600 --> 11:06.840]  poignant and to the point recruiting thugs for the police state in New
[11:06.840 --> 11:12.480]  Mexico the state considers the American people the enemy and it shows a police
[11:12.480 --> 11:17.880]  training video that documents that very powerful article by Curt Nemo that I
[11:17.880 --> 11:24.640]  will attempt to read on air later and also play that police training video for
[11:24.640 --> 11:29.680]  the larger radio TV audience but everyone can watch the video at info wars
[11:29.680 --> 11:34.200]  calm and prison planet calm before I get to the big news that broke Friday and
[11:34.200 --> 11:38.400]  some new developments on that front that Cliven Bundy is gonna be joining us to
[11:38.400 --> 11:43.240]  talk about for 30 minutes at the start of the next hour today let me just give
[11:43.240 --> 11:47.440]  you the headlines here Harry Reid calls Cliven Bundy supporters domestic
[11:47.440 --> 11:51.280]  terrorists and White House counterterror chief says confrontational
[11:51.280 --> 11:55.320]  children could be terrorists we're gonna be playing the audio of that coming up I
[11:55.320 --> 12:00.240]  know we covered it Friday but it's a big deal and it's still our top story because
[12:00.240 --> 12:04.120]  it ties into the new rollout of us being the enemy everyone being the
[12:04.120 --> 12:08.560]  suspects but the government that actually runs Al Qaeda publicly but forget
[12:08.560 --> 12:13.080]  about Al Qaeda I told you six years ago they were gonna come out with white Al
[12:13.080 --> 12:17.840]  Qaeda and conservative Al Qaeda and libertarian Al Qaeda and gun owner Al
[12:17.840 --> 12:23.400]  Qaeda and farmer Al Qaeda and people are all freaking out now saying how did Alex
[12:23.400 --> 12:27.200]  Jones know all that in fact Rob do's put a compilation together we're gonna play
[12:27.200 --> 12:33.520]  today or tomorrow where I predicted this literally hundreds of times hundreds of
[12:33.520 --> 12:38.240]  times you as listeners heard it because Hollywood is the first line of
[12:38.240 --> 12:43.920]  propaganda when the dramas the sitcoms the kids cartoons the video games are
[12:43.920 --> 12:50.160]  all casting gun owners as murderers who are gonna blow up the government and who
[12:50.160 --> 12:54.440]  are child molesters and who are killers and who plan to nerve gas New York and
[12:54.440 --> 12:57.800]  then we start getting government documents where the Pentagon's being
[12:57.800 --> 13:02.040]  trained for that to be the new enemy obviously Homeland Security was set up
[13:02.040 --> 13:07.360]  for that in the beginning they just got you to accept a rollout for Al Qaeda who
[13:07.360 --> 13:12.880]  they actually run and again they publicly run them they publicly protect
[13:12.880 --> 13:18.760]  them and now they're gonna move the script on to who do they fear they fear
[13:18.760 --> 13:22.520]  the people that have actually been taken over the world for them who they
[13:22.520 --> 13:25.840]  know aren't afraid to die and have the skills to fight back it's the night of
[13:25.840 --> 13:29.840]  the long knives what did Hitler do after he'd been in power about a year he
[13:29.840 --> 13:35.040]  killed almost everyone that brought him to power because the people that brought
[13:35.040 --> 13:38.440]  him to power most of them actually really thought he was trying to help
[13:38.440 --> 13:42.280]  Germany I'm not romanticizing them or saying they were good a lot of them
[13:42.280 --> 13:46.200]  were absolute total criminal psychopath racist you name it but a lot of them
[13:46.200 --> 13:49.480]  also were so upset about the Versailles Treaty in Germany being in so much
[13:49.480 --> 13:54.040]  trouble and wanted to save the Reich the land the homeland that that they did a
[13:54.040 --> 13:58.320]  lot of bad things in the name of the greater good well they had to be
[13:58.320 --> 14:03.920]  eliminated and so all of you that aren't evil that have served this evil system
[14:03.920 --> 14:10.520]  you are the final trash that has to be taken out and in every case
[14:10.520 --> 14:20.920]  historically this follows an exact criminology pattern you're going to be
[14:20.920 --> 14:24.760]  targeted and you are being targeted and now you're seeing the full shift to oh
[14:24.760 --> 14:31.320]  yeah Homeland Security is for veterans and gun owners and rural communities well
[14:31.320 --> 14:35.240]  yeah all the training manuals now all of them have nothing to do with Muslim
[14:35.240 --> 14:41.680]  extremist it's all land rights disputes is unit 21 folks not getting off the land
[14:41.680 --> 14:45.840]  people not paying property tax they're going to use the taxes to bankrupt the
[14:45.840 --> 14:52.160]  country the globalist are exempt from the taxes they use the taxes to destroy
[14:52.160 --> 14:56.520]  you so they get your property your compliance and domesticate you and if
[14:56.520 --> 15:00.280]  you hold on and don't pay the fines and fees and taxes that are designed to
[15:00.280 --> 15:05.880]  bankrupt you they're going to send paramilitary to kill you but first they
[15:05.880 --> 15:12.720]  have to demonize you so the paramilitary feel good about their mission and then
[15:12.720 --> 15:16.720]  as soon as that paramilitary has done their job they get put on the you know
[15:16.720 --> 15:20.640]  what list because they're not going to ever pay that paramilitary their pension
[15:20.640 --> 15:24.880]  funds you're not going to get your military pension funds it's all being
[15:24.880 --> 15:28.040]  set up it's all being prepared it's already happening in Europe it's all
[15:28.040 --> 15:31.520]  being announced they will first cut them by 30 40 percent then they'll cut them
[15:31.520 --> 15:35.480]  another 34 percent and you'll go along with it until it's nothing and then you
[15:35.480 --> 15:38.760]  won't be able to live you're going to be angry and disgruntled and they know
[15:38.760 --> 15:45.640]  that Rome had riots with their military not getting their pensions over and over
[15:45.640 --> 15:49.920]  again the Roman Empire the Babylonian Empire had problems the British Empire
[15:49.920 --> 15:54.000]  had problems the US military after World War one didn't pay the bonuses they
[15:54.000 --> 15:58.640]  promised to the disabled vets so they camped out outside the White House and
[15:58.640 --> 16:06.040]  so they pulled up with army tanks and soldiers and horses and killed them so
[16:06.040 --> 16:14.080]  so they've always had to throw you in the garbage can because they know
[16:14.080 --> 16:17.000]  veterans tend to come back and actually try to build a better country after a
[16:17.000 --> 16:20.920]  war after World War two who let the civil rights movement US veterans
[16:20.920 --> 16:26.560]  military veterans look it up they were the main group pushing for civil rights
[16:26.560 --> 16:31.000]  because they're like we just beat Hitler but we're gonna do some of the same
[16:31.000 --> 16:36.120]  stuff here see they know you've got to be taken out and targeted you've got at
[16:36.120 --> 16:40.040]  least be put on a bunch of drugs given PTSD designations and thrown out like
[16:40.040 --> 16:43.880]  trash so we're gonna be covering that today that's our top story and Bundy's
[16:43.880 --> 16:48.360]  coming on because it's bigger than Bundy and notice the FBI Harry Reid they're
[16:48.360 --> 16:51.360]  all saying congressional hearings that that they're not gonna let to stand that
[16:51.360 --> 16:56.120]  they've got to arrest everybody they've got to come after Bundy because they
[16:56.120 --> 17:02.400]  can't let you get the idea that you could ever stand up against them but we
[17:02.400 --> 17:09.720]  need to make an M4 Wars image to tweet out that says Harry Reid declares you

[18:21.280 --> 18:26.760]  be a channel for these people because it's not really conservative all thought
[18:26.760 --> 18:32.240]  that isn't basically Soviet does the bankers use a Soviet management model
[18:32.240 --> 18:37.760]  that's what it is the bankers in 1917 developed the plan out of British
[18:37.760 --> 18:42.680]  population control programs and British imperial management systems that they've
[18:42.680 --> 18:49.400]  been using to deploy to the Bolsheviks to bring down their ancestral enemy their
[18:49.400 --> 18:54.080]  cousin the Russians the czars the British the British Royalty ran Germany
[18:54.080 --> 18:58.360]  that was basically itself German royalty and so they just brought down their own

[24:38.640 --> 24:47.720]  of the news up on info wars dot com is extremely important obviously we've
[24:47.720 --> 24:52.520]  got a report Ebola suspected in Europe broken through all containment efforts
[24:52.520 --> 24:57.640]  that's being reported by Reuters though officials the World Health Organization
[24:57.640 --> 25:02.600]  are feverishly working to stop the spread of the Ebola virus and what is now
[25:02.600 --> 25:07.400]  seven African nations that's an unprecedented outbreak their efforts
[25:07.400 --> 25:13.320]  maybe for not in Geneva or in Yana that's in Africa I was thinking of Europe
[25:13.320 --> 25:18.520]  from the Geneva Convention in Geneva Switzerland in Guyana a hot spot for
[25:18.520 --> 25:22.800]  the deadly contagion government health officials have said the outbreak is
[25:22.800 --> 25:27.080]  nearly under control yet Reuters reports that the government planned to stop
[25:27.080 --> 25:31.760]  publicly releasing the death toll to avoid causing unnecessary panic is the
[25:31.760 --> 25:35.840]  quote despite the best efforts of emergency health workers it appears the
[25:35.840 --> 25:39.920]  virus may have crossed out of Africa into Europe the outbreak of the Ebola
[25:39.920 --> 25:43.720]  virus is seven West African countries has broken through all efforts to
[25:43.720 --> 25:46.840]  contain it and spreading like wildfire according to Christian relief groups
[25:46.840 --> 25:51.760]  working in Guyana Liberia and a number of other confirmed infections have jumped
[25:51.760 --> 25:58.960]  15% in just the last 24 hours so we'll continue to watch all of that and if you
[25:58.960 --> 26:04.640]  go up to info wars dot com you can read those out of the French news and other
[26:04.640 --> 26:10.560]  publications and we have links to Reuters and others in the story so
[26:10.560 --> 26:14.960]  sounds pretty bad if a bowl ever becomes airborne look out ladies and
[26:14.960 --> 26:20.240]  gentlemen obviously so that's some of the news on that front another zero hedge
[26:20.240 --> 26:25.760]  article this means war you have to target Putin's personal 40 billion
[26:25.760 --> 26:29.480]  dollar stash while the White House has continually threatened further
[26:29.480 --> 26:36.400]  sanctions against Russia for non de-escalation even as it de-escalates
[26:36.400 --> 26:42.880]  itself the specifics of the additional sanctions have been sparse German CEO
[26:42.880 --> 26:46.800]  warnings over blowback from economic sanctions and the nonsense of replacing
[26:46.800 --> 26:52.040]  Russian gas with US gas the Russian warnings of interdependence and boomerangs
[26:52.040 --> 26:57.080]  all reduce the West's arsenal of financial sanctions but as the Times of
[26:57.080 --> 27:01.720]  London reports perhaps the US has found a crucial pain point for Putin a
[27:01.720 --> 27:06.640]  sanctions the regime that would target Putin's personal wealth which includes
[27:06.640 --> 27:13.080]  a reported 40 billion stash in Swiss bank accounts the Hill reports the White
[27:13.080 --> 27:16.440]  House on Friday refused a comment on reports that Russian President
[27:16.440 --> 27:20.000]  Vladimir Putin's personal wealth could be targeted if the West were to move
[27:20.000 --> 27:25.120]  ahead with additional sanctions over Ukraine but the Times of London says
[27:25.120 --> 27:29.200]  the US was preparing for a sanctions on the regime that would target Putin's
[27:29.200 --> 27:32.920]  personal wealth which includes a reported 40 billion that may be propaganda
[27:32.920 --> 27:38.800]  itself I mean I'm sure he's got money stashed with 40 billion and do the
[27:38.800 --> 27:44.000]  globalist want to start the dangerous game of targeting other despots money
[27:44.000 --> 27:47.560]  how big you think Bill Clinton's Swiss bank accounts are how big you think
[27:47.560 --> 27:52.200]  Barack Obama's Swiss bank accounts are well the answer is they just hide all
[27:52.200 --> 27:59.160]  that in plain view Congress gets caught insider trading five years ago their
[27:59.160 --> 28:03.040]  answers just say it's legal people go but it's not legal okay we'll pass a
[28:03.040 --> 28:08.320]  lot of reform it close quote which actually legalizes insider trading for
[28:08.320 --> 28:13.800]  Congress well I say that if you legalize murder for yourself that laws of
[28:13.800 --> 28:19.440]  fraud and it's certainly a fraud if other people can't murder but only you
[28:19.440 --> 28:25.320]  were exempt well I mean I guess we could pass a law saying you know that we live
[28:25.320 --> 28:32.240]  in a country of total and complete anarchy but you can't kill somebody
[28:32.240 --> 28:37.640]  only they can well that's not anarchy that's called a hypocritical fraud

[35:12.480 --> 35:16.840]  Globe correct last year when they said in the headline sort of the BBC had a
[35:16.840 --> 35:21.960]  similar article is the Declaration of Independence terrorism that's the
[35:21.960 --> 35:27.600]  headline and the majority of lawyers said yes it says you have a right and a
[35:27.600 --> 35:32.600]  duty to throw off a tyrannical government and they said that's not true
[35:32.600 --> 35:44.000]  they attacked the very basic bedrock of our republic and they said no you never
[35:44.000 --> 35:49.360]  have a right so in China where if the government doesn't like you they will
[35:49.360 --> 35:53.440]  cut your genitals off and throw you in the street or will take you and steal
[35:53.440 --> 35:57.280]  your organs in a mobile execution van your new listeners just type in
[35:57.280 --> 36:04.920]  mobile execution van folks you can pull that up the big question and the big
[36:04.920 --> 36:10.600]  issue here is when the police beat old men to death because they feel like it
[36:10.600 --> 36:17.240]  in China and the public riots against the communist oppressors and beats the
[36:17.240 --> 36:25.360]  police into bloody pulps is that wrong is there ever a right to stand up and
[36:25.360 --> 36:32.200]  the answer by Harry Reid is no there is never a time to stand up so here's the
[36:32.200 --> 36:38.360]  toll-free number for first-time callers the toll-free number to join us is 800
[36:38.360 --> 36:50.160]  259 9231 800 259 9231 and I will get you up and on the air but but
[36:50.160 --> 36:54.400]  specifically is there ever a time to stand up is there ever a time to say
[36:54.400 --> 37:00.040]  no is there and of course obviously if you don't stand up you will end up in a
[37:00.040 --> 37:04.800]  total tyranny submitting laying down groveling to the power grabs has brought
[37:04.800 --> 37:09.840]  us to the point we're at now where the system thinks we're so enslaved so
[37:09.840 --> 37:26.200]  stupid so pathetic so bad that they have the nerve and they have the will to pass
[37:26.200 --> 37:32.560]  Obamacare bipartisanly that was written by offshore banks on record to
[37:32.560 --> 37:36.960]  massively increase the price of health care lower the quality bring government
[37:36.960 --> 37:43.120]  control death panels in and raise seven taxes on people making as little as
[37:43.120 --> 37:53.720]  $14,000 a year cutting your hours from 40 down to 30 or less just absolutely
[37:53.720 --> 37:57.760]  screwing you on every front and folks they passed it and you notice they're
[37:57.760 --> 38:02.400]  not repealing it even though it's over 80% unpopular in national mainline
[38:02.400 --> 38:07.800]  polls notice it's there to stay and they're going to pass more they're
[38:07.800 --> 38:11.320]  going to take your pensions they're going to take your social security they're
[38:11.320 --> 38:14.000]  going to take it in pieces they're going to take it all and they're going to
[38:14.000 --> 38:20.600]  devalue your currency and the stock market will go up because you're buying
[38:20.600 --> 38:27.160]  the stocks and devalued dollars but when it all is said and done it it is
[38:27.160 --> 38:37.200]  inventing a tyranny to absolutely destroy you and remember the architect of it
[38:37.200 --> 38:43.480]  came out and said we plan to destroy the health care system zealom annual it's
[38:43.480 --> 38:48.480]  not even my opinion and you've got all the zealots that work for the system who
[38:48.480 --> 38:52.640]  think they're on some winning team being part of this incredible dishonor when
[38:52.640 --> 38:56.720]  you open the gates to tyranny folks it ends up robbing and screwing everyone
[38:56.720 --> 39:00.320]  and destroying the prosperity and I know our audience knows that but we have to
[39:00.320 --> 39:04.520]  get this out to everybody now I want to get into this first we covered this
[39:04.520 --> 39:09.680]  Friday and Sunday but I want to get back into it now this is Harry Reid saying
[39:09.680 --> 39:16.760]  that the Bundy supporters are domestic terrorists here it is so these people
[39:16.760 --> 39:23.280]  who hold themselves out to be patriots are not nothing more than domestic
[39:23.280 --> 39:27.520]  terrorists and I think that we are a country that people should follow the
[39:27.520 --> 39:32.920]  law and what went up in the ski is not very good I repeat what went up there is
[39:32.920 --> 39:40.000]  domestic tourism okay their domestic terrorism not tourism and of course he
[39:40.000 --> 39:42.960]  went on in the full clip we played on Friday to just say you know they had
[39:42.960 --> 39:47.760]  kids up front so they would get killed not true because they want kids to die
[39:47.760 --> 39:51.440]  like Oklahoma City where the feds bombed it and put the bomb right by the day
[39:51.440 --> 39:57.600]  care center knowing they had images of dead kids you mean like that and that
[39:57.600 --> 40:00.440]  they were you know they're wanting to shoot the feds no they were there with
[40:00.440 --> 40:04.560]  their guns down their side the minority that had guns and they marched across the
[40:04.560 --> 40:09.360]  line as the feds said we will shoot you and the feds backed off because they're
[40:09.360 --> 40:14.520]  not feds they're mercenaries there to take over the West so that it can be
[40:14.520 --> 40:18.920]  removed from the American people's control to be handed over to globalist as
[40:18.920 --> 40:23.320]  collateral on the national debt and that's all on record in the executive
[40:23.320 --> 40:28.560]  orders but here's the deal the 17 18 trillion we really owe is a drop in the
[40:28.560 --> 40:34.880]  bucket compared to the 700 trillion of the 1.5 global quadrillion that the
[40:34.880 --> 40:40.920]  globalists created they're the people that created the debt Iceland arrested
[40:40.920 --> 40:45.400]  their head banking minister and discovered 90 plus percent was like 93%
[40:45.400 --> 40:51.360]  this is two years ago was not owed by them the 400,000 Icelanders were told
[40:51.360 --> 40:56.760]  you each owe over a million pounds because our money was pegged to the
[40:56.760 --> 41:03.360]  pound that's like a million and a half dollars or more in US money and the
[41:03.360 --> 41:05.880]  people just wouldn't pay it and then they found out wait the government
[41:05.880 --> 41:11.960]  signed us on to all this debt that's not ours and they arrested people they
[41:11.960 --> 41:20.040]  arrested them the name of the game is get people in debt bankrupt them so
[41:20.040 --> 41:27.320]  that's the big issue ladies and gentlemen now continuing here to Harry
[41:27.320 --> 41:35.400]  Reid let's move on to Lisa Monaco who talks about hey if your kids are you
[41:35.400 --> 41:40.960]  know acting out if your children quote are confrontational that's a sign they
[41:40.960 --> 41:45.800]  may be terrorists see mom dad you can't even trust your children you can trust
[41:45.800 --> 41:51.560]  one thing and one thing only and that's the state and then all the criminal
[41:51.560 --> 41:59.120]  interest that have their hands in the state see the state is only the
[41:59.120 --> 42:03.360]  apparatus through which the special interest are engaged in this takeover
[42:03.360 --> 42:07.200]  I'm not even demonizing people that work for the state the average police
[42:07.200 --> 42:11.800]  officer the average teacher the average bureaucrat their compartmentalized
[42:11.800 --> 42:17.920]  given very narrow things that they can do that they're constrained but they
[42:17.920 --> 42:23.960]  should leak things not comply really soul search which side they're on and and
[42:23.960 --> 42:27.960]  ask themselves is helping the system come into being good or we want to
[42:27.960 --> 42:35.480]  reverse the path wrong but the real onus is with us we the people what are we
[42:35.480 --> 42:40.040]  going to do so let's go to this clip a White House counterterrorism chief
[42:40.040 --> 42:46.960]  confrontational children could be terrorist she said this on CBS news PBS
[42:46.960 --> 42:51.120]  news and then she this particular clip though is from her Harvard speech where
[42:51.120 --> 42:54.800]  she said some more things here it is so what kinds of behaviors are we talking
[42:54.800 --> 42:59.320]  about for the most part they're not related directly to actually plotting
[42:59.320 --> 43:05.760]  attacks they're more subtle parents might see sudden personality changes in
[43:05.760 --> 43:11.040]  their children at home becoming more confrontational than usual religious
[43:11.040 --> 43:17.040]  leaders might notice unexpected clashes over ideological differences and
[43:17.040 --> 43:22.960]  teachers might hear students expressing an interest to travel to a conflict zone
[43:22.960 --> 43:30.000]  overseas or friends might notice a new interest in watching or sharing violent
[43:30.000 --> 43:35.440]  material the government is of course rarely in a position to observe these
[43:35.440 --> 43:40.360]  early signals so we need to do more to help communities and community members
[43:40.360 --> 43:46.120]  understand the warning signs and then work together to intervene before
[43:46.120 --> 43:53.680]  something can occur while always and this is important while always respecting
[43:53.680 --> 43:59.360]  our core commitment to protecting privacy and civil liberties all of this is
[43:59.360 --> 44:05.120]  for not if we don't have the trust in our communities between both the
[44:05.120 --> 44:10.920]  government and the members of the community all right and then shifting
[44:10.920 --> 44:17.320]  gears we have another clip here this is Kalia Justice Kalia the Supreme Court
[44:17.320 --> 44:26.040]  talking about the TSA and NSA here's that clip doesn't it follow that the US
[44:26.040 --> 44:31.880]  government would not be able to justify its NSA surveillance program and that
[44:31.880 --> 44:35.960]  therefore conceivably could be in violation of the Constitution now
[44:35.960 --> 44:39.800]  because it's not absolute as Ruth said there are very few freedoms that are
[44:39.800 --> 44:45.320]  absolute oh I mean your your person is protected by the Fourth Amendment but as
[44:45.320 --> 44:50.840]  I pointed out when you board a plane somebody can can pass his hands all
[44:50.840 --> 44:56.560]  over you all over your body that's a terrible intrusion but given the danger
[44:56.560 --> 45:01.480]  oh that it's guarding against it's not an unreasonable intrusion and it can be
[45:01.480 --> 45:08.040]  the same thing with acquiring this data that that that is regarded as effects
[45:08.040 --> 45:13.400]  depends on health and that's why I say it's it's foolish to have us make the
[45:13.400 --> 45:17.320]  decision because I don't know how serious the danger is all right let's stop
[45:17.320 --> 45:21.380]  there that's right it's like who makes the decision of what's the danger is the
[45:21.380 --> 45:26.040]  NSA the CIA openly set up by the globalist openly set up to take over
[45:26.040 --> 45:31.320]  the country openly running al-Qaeda and you have the soft sell-outs the system
[45:31.320 --> 45:37.080]  Scalia who's a lawyer and knows that's pure treason you know if there's a
[45:37.080 --> 45:43.200]  danger we can do whatever we want really that was never accepted before got a
[45:43.200 --> 45:45.680]  better chance of dying from honey bee sting every year than from terrorist
[45:45.680 --> 45:52.080]  look it up even a squire did an article on that last year deer jumping out in
[45:52.080 --> 45:58.440]  front of your car kills more people than terrorist they don't care though it's
[45:58.440 --> 46:03.880]  this perception of we're gonna protect you hypothetically somebody can do a
[46:03.880 --> 46:10.520]  mass shooting on a highway we need checkpoints on the highway now remember
[46:10.520 --> 46:14.480]  what the BBC put out last year and then the Boston global so ran a similar
[46:14.480 --> 46:18.240]  headline and we're putting it on screen right now is the US Declaration of
[46:18.240 --> 46:29.520]  Independence illegal and they go on to say maybe it's even terrorist because it
[46:29.520 --> 46:33.120]  dares to say you have a right to stand up against a government I mean this is
[46:33.120 --> 46:39.640]  another headline is the Declaration of Independence unconstitutional this is
[46:39.640 --> 46:46.920]  not a joke this is what the system is pushing because they're overthrowing
[46:46.920 --> 46:49.200]  everything they've got to make it look normal so they have one of the
[46:49.200 --> 46:52.720]  justices of the Supreme Court go on c-span in front of a whole room of
[46:52.720 --> 46:58.080]  lawyers and say no there's no absolute we can have the NSA spying grabbing
[46:58.080 --> 47:02.480]  everybody's data we can grope you really it's always been totally illegal so the
[47:02.480 --> 47:09.120]  government lied about it now they get caught they go oh we're allowed to this
[47:09.120 --> 47:14.120]  is a revolution of tyrants and authoritarians against us and it's been
[47:14.120 --> 47:19.720]  going pretty well so finally you get 52 families driven on a business even though
[47:19.720 --> 47:24.160]  they had the grazing rights under state and federal law before the BLM existed
[47:24.160 --> 47:29.720]  BLM comes along and arbitrarily says you will pay us all this a federal court
[47:29.720 --> 47:34.280]  last year in Nevada said that very BLM was quote in a criminal conspiracy hit
[47:34.280 --> 47:37.520]  downs were an article about that on Friday but it's been in all the mainstream
[47:37.520 --> 47:43.680]  news but the media won't cover it it's in a vacuum that last year headline
[47:43.680 --> 47:49.040]  federal judge says BLM involved in criminal conspiracy in Nevada well they
[47:49.040 --> 47:52.640]  are in a criminal conspiracy to run people off their land just like the
[47:52.640 --> 47:57.840]  coal power plants that are totally clean supply of our energy they used to and
[47:57.840 --> 48:02.040]  they're shutting them down all over the country and Obama says I'm gonna raise
[48:02.040 --> 48:07.920]  taxes to the point that bankrupt you that's our goal our goal is to use taxes
[48:07.920 --> 48:12.560]  outside of law because Congress won't pass a law to do this so I'm gonna use
[48:12.560 --> 48:17.120]  taxes to destroy you but I'm gonna give General Electric and four other
[48:17.120 --> 48:21.760]  companies waivers so they can operate coal power plants but nobody else can so
[48:21.760 --> 48:27.040]  on top of using taxes to destroy people they let their crooked friends operate
[48:27.040 --> 48:31.680]  what do you think's gonna happen in an economy like that it's gonna be just
[48:31.680 --> 48:35.880]  like New York City and mob run areas you're not gonna have a business unless
[48:35.880 --> 48:39.400]  the mob basically owns it and you're going to be their slave and have to
[48:39.400 --> 48:47.720]  kiss their butt all day I don't want to live in a country like that I mean if
[48:47.720 --> 48:52.600]  some mobster showed up at my office and said you pay me money or I'm gonna come
[48:52.600 --> 48:57.760]  up to your family folks I would knock their teeth in right there on the spot
[48:57.760 --> 49:02.440]  there's a reason the mafia never fly in Texas because people will kill you if
[49:02.440 --> 49:06.480]  you try to go around telling people what to do guarantee anybody in my family
[49:06.480 --> 49:09.920]  growing up my grandfather's especially somebody came to their house saying
[49:09.920 --> 49:12.840]  everybody my grandfather's would kill you on the spot and it wasn't because they
[49:12.840 --> 49:15.760]  were these great guys these are guys that taught Sunday school these are guys
[49:15.760 --> 49:19.560]  that played football with Tom Landry these are guys that flew b-17s you know
[49:19.560 --> 49:24.000]  over Europe these are guys that opened doors little ladies my
[49:24.000 --> 49:27.840]  grandfathers would kill someone the minute they did that they would kill you
[49:27.840 --> 49:31.640]  and it wasn't because they were violent evil bad people it was because they
[49:31.640 --> 49:36.840]  weren't slaves ladies and gentlemen and they understood but no we would do that
[49:36.840 --> 49:40.200]  hell if you put a mobster in a uniform and they came and said bring your
[49:40.200 --> 49:42.840]  daughter out here the average American would bring their daughter out and
[49:42.840 --> 49:46.400]  bender over a barrel and if the cops had stabbed your daughter in there with an
[49:46.400 --> 49:50.280]  ice pick the average American would do it because in this country people worship
[49:50.280 --> 49:53.440]  the state and blind authority we're gonna go to break and come back with

[51:59.080 --> 52:02.840]  hi folks Alex Jones here was some important information I want to tell you
[52:02.840 --> 52:06.840]  about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at my Patriots supply
[52:06.840 --> 52:10.880]  several years ago Matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment frustrated with
[52:10.880 --> 52:14.360]  the direction this country was headed and the charlottes willing to sell us out
[52:14.360 --> 52:19.200]  for a quick buck deciding to take action a company run by Patriots for Patriots
[52:19.200 --> 52:23.760]  was born by Patriots supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding

[54:39.200 --> 54:42.760]  of go along the lines what you're talking about you know with what people are
[54:42.760 --> 54:49.600]  willing to put up with and you know I've been in this kind of truth movement or
[54:49.600 --> 54:54.120]  whatever you want to call it for a number of years now and you know when I
[54:54.120 --> 54:58.600]  first got into it I was you know exploding on everybody you know point
[54:58.600 --> 55:02.720]  them in your direction telling them what was going on and you know now it's got
[55:02.720 --> 55:08.160]  to the point where it's like you know I listen to people and I see them online
[55:08.160 --> 55:11.240]  and I see generally that a lot of people they don't even know what they're
[55:11.240 --> 55:14.600]  talking about for the most part they just kind of believe whatever they want to
[55:14.600 --> 55:20.080]  believe and also you know yeah what's happened is people are either awakening
[55:20.080 --> 55:23.200]  or they don't believe the system anymore but they don't know what to believe
[55:23.200 --> 55:28.880]  they're just going in all different directions exactly and also I can
[55:28.880 --> 55:33.040]  counter a lot of people who generally they kind of want to be dominated by
[55:33.040 --> 55:36.840]  these people you know I'm looking I'm renaught you know I mean they have
[55:36.840 --> 55:40.960]  Stockholm syndrome that they feel so disempowered that they think at least
[55:40.960 --> 55:46.960]  they have the power to grovel to the black boots you know corporations they
[55:46.960 --> 55:53.080]  you know the controlling powers in the world they literally seek out cycle paths
[55:53.080 --> 55:57.200]  to run sure sure my question today though listeners was and I'm really
[55:57.200 --> 56:02.080]  I'm asking you this Vic is is there any amount of tyranny that we have a right
[56:02.080 --> 56:05.320]  to stand up against obviously we have a right to stand up any time we want
[56:05.320 --> 56:08.480]  against tyranny but but I'm throwing the question out there I'm begging the
[56:08.480 --> 56:13.840]  question I mean is there any level of tyranny that people won't put up with
[56:13.840 --> 56:22.920]  what is your line in the sand well I think Bondi as a is a great example for
[56:22.920 --> 56:27.840]  people to really stand behind and get behind and really just start a movement
[56:27.840 --> 56:33.640]  to just kind of abolish property taxes all together because they are unconstitutional
[56:33.640 --> 56:37.720]  if I'm am I correct on that absolutely I mean it's right out of the communist
[56:37.720 --> 56:43.280]  manifesto property taxes I appreciate your call here's the Christian Science
[56:43.280 --> 56:48.640]  Monitor reporting on the range war and I have one here as well out of the Las
[56:48.640 --> 56:54.040]  Vegas paper there's several articles in fact it's up on Drudge I'm looking for
[56:54.040 --> 57:00.040]  it in my stack it's a cowboy hat on Drudge it says Western States move to
[57:00.040 --> 57:06.240]  take over federal land and the headline is Nevada range war Western States move
[57:06.240 --> 57:14.440]  to take over federal land and it gets into the fact that more than 50 state
[57:14.440 --> 57:22.800]  legislators from different states met and discussed the fact that they're
[57:22.800 --> 57:29.120]  moving to try to take away the federal land because it's not federal land I
[57:29.120 --> 57:34.640]  mean you look at Texas one or two percent is federal you look at places
[57:34.640 --> 57:41.120]  like Nevada it's close to 90% and the feds don't own this they don't pay taxes
[57:41.120 --> 57:45.680]  they don't produce they just drive around with paramilitary police the point
[57:45.680 --> 57:52.280]  guns at us I mean I was at Big Bend a few weeks ago and had one run in with
[57:52.280 --> 57:55.880]  somebody in the uniform and they literally walked over and said what are
[57:55.880 --> 58:02.200]  you doing and I was sitting there by the Rio Grande River sitting there and I
[58:02.200 --> 58:09.680]  said excuse me just what are you doing and he just kept staring at me with his
[58:09.680 --> 58:16.120]  hand on his gun I just ignored him and he said they're smiling at me and then
[58:16.120 --> 58:20.480]  left it was bizarre it was like when you go to a party and some weirdos mentally
[58:20.480 --> 58:23.680]  ill is there and they are acting strange you don't understand what their
[58:23.680 --> 58:28.520]  what their point is I mean imagine somebody that wants a gun in a badge so
[58:28.520 --> 58:32.760]  they can run around messing with people it's just it's the essence of tyranny

[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:41.720]  for a country raised the last 60 years on television a plastic synthetic fake
[01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:45.960]  culture and people now don't have families they don't have role models
[01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:50.840]  they basically are like flotsam and jetsam we have to point out what made
[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:54.200]  America great versus what's bringing America down that's really our big
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:01:00.160]  task here Tom in Nevada you're on the air what's your line in the sand and is
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:05.200]  the BBC right is the Declaration of Independence terrorism to say that we
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:08.240]  could ever stand up against a government I mean the government wanted to put you
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:12.080]  in a forced labor camp shouldn't you go to the force labor camp because obviously
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:24.560]  government knows best oh hell no the line in the sand is now the it brain
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:29.400]  fade here we need to stand and the Constitution was written by people that
[01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:37.120]  understood that and for our time now we're what what point you know do you
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:41.920]  give up your rights when the troops are marching down the streets here in the
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:47.960]  wastelands of lost wages that are here in Vegas and Harry greed la la land you
[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:53.600]  know it's it's ridiculous the guy is crooked is a days long and now he set a
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:58.040]  precedent by claiming and labeling everybody a domestic terrorist does that
[01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:03.200]  mean if you yell at somebody now you're a domestic terrorist can slander charges
[01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:08.480]  and defamation of character charges be brought up against him for you know the
[01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:12.840]  Bundy's you know and well the issue here is and I'm gonna talk about that with
[01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:17.000]  Mr. Bundy coming up the precedent's being said that any type of civil
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:22.400]  disobedience is terrorism he's following a plan this has been planned they're
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:25.280]  gonna push and push till there's resistance they're gonna call it
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:32.040]  terrorism they're going to start a civil war our question is how do we turn the
[01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:37.800]  tide back against that great points Tom in Nevada let's talk to Josh in Texas
[01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:44.600]  you're on the air Josh go ahead yes sir hey yeah I've been listening to you show
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:48.480]  about three years now and this is my first time calling I get the line and the
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:52.400]  plan would be I guess about for anybody when it happens to you you know you
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:55.800]  hear about stories that's happening and don't really at home he gets your you
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:03:03.640]  know right sprinkled over and you know like yesterday you know I was out here
[01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:11.520]  shooting on a brand's place and cop showed up you know took my Heidi run my
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:14.960]  life says no I kind of stuff and told me it was illegal to shoot the gun out here
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:19.080]  in the county and told me if I didn't put it up it's gonna take it well I
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:22.840]  wouldn't have complied with them that you know after little heated argument
[01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:25.800]  here and there but then I went to the police department this morning and talk
[01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:29.360]  to them and try to figure out why they done that basically it's about ignorance
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:32.560]  because they said the cops didn't know no better so if we're dealing with
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:36.600]  somebody just you know telling somebody something and then doing it because they
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:40.840]  don't know no better yeah I believe it's never gonna get no better by the way
[01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:47.040]  before you even finish your story I knew the answer they played dumb everyone I
[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:51.200]  know and I mean everyone I know that owns 20 acres a hundred acres 200 acres
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:56.600]  300 acres in the middle of nowhere Californians home prices all collapse
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:04:00.040]  basically they think houses are cheap in central Texas you know they're
[01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:06.680]  expensive for me they're all out here buying houses on farms and when they
[01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:11.720]  hear you shoot they call the police and the and the cops will come on your
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:15.880]  property and say we're gonna arrest you you go but I'm allowed to shoot they go
[01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:21.240]  I don't care you're going to jail or or they'll take your guns and then it gets
[01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:25.840]  into court and all this stuff it's lawlessness sir they're going to come
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:30.320]  after our guns period and everywhere this is happening you shoot your guns
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:35.440]  they show up I mean listen you run into game wardens now they're bugging their
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:38.360]  eyes out and got their hand on their gun when you're sitting around a campfire
[01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:46.760]  government is striking itself up for a civil war with us and so you understand
[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:51.080]  they were playing dumb with you did you know that oh yes sir I got Bundy

[01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:11.840]  behind enemy lines the information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN
[01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:31.360]  radio network
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:39.000]  ladies and gentlemen we are back live on this Monday edition and joining us from
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:44.560]  southern Nevada is Clive and Bundy it's now a giant international story
[01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:49.440]  worldwide something right out of an old Western something right out of the
[01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:55.640]  history books 1775 1776 something right out of the end of V for Vendetta when
[01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:59.480]  the armies out there with their guns around parliament aiming them at the
[01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:04.640]  people saying we're gonna shoot you if you cross the line and the people cross
[01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:10.720]  the line Harry Reid last week came out and said that Bundy and his supporters
[01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:13.920]  are nothing more than domestic terrorists and they were planning to use
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:19.080]  women and children at the front to be killed with no evidence of that so he's
[01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:24.960]  just demonizing people now but here's the issue this is why this is so
[01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:30.800]  important mr. Bundy's joining us here in just a moment this is the demonization
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:37.720]  of civil disobedience and property rights this is the demonization of that as
[01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:43.360]  terrorism this is what I've been telling you now for year after year behind the
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:47.720]  scenes of the feds and the same things been happening in Europe have been
[01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:52.280]  training that anyone who doesn't turn their property over turn their children
[01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:56.920]  over anyone who doesn't comply with forced inoculation anyone that doesn't
[01:09:56.920 --> 01:10:00.840]  comply with martial law is a terrorist and they train in all the manuals that
[01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:05.880]  we've broken remember back people couldn't believe those manuals and now
[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:11.880]  it's so mainstream it's passé that the military the police they're all training
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:17.640]  to take on gun owners returning veterans veterans Christians
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:24.720]  conservatives libertarians constitutionalists I mean they list Ron Paul
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:31.560]  Alex Jones Aaron Russo they list films like America Freedom to Fascism that
[01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:35.920]  exposes the IRS this is a totally illegitimate out-of-control system
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:40.440]  violating laws on every front exempting themselves from the laws they put on us
[01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:45.560]  Declaration of Independence on steroids the train of abuses that are listed
[01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:50.360]  there is nothing compared to what we're going through and Bundy and these guys
[01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:56.200]  stand up peacefully the feds have killed a bunch of the cattle they found mass
[01:10:56.200 --> 01:11:00.200]  graves shot the bulls they admit they shot the bulls now so they were quote
[01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:05.400]  dangerous that's a destroy his herd of animals that have learned to live out
[01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:09.080]  there for hundreds of years over 100 years this is a total takeover destroying
[01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:12.000]  the water tanks the federal judge we're going to show this article from last
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:16.280]  Friday Kit Daniels ruled last year that the BLM is quote in a criminal
[01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:20.200]  conspiracy in Nevada and ordered them out of his jurisdiction he said I want
[01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:26.320]  new BLM never happened that was Judge Jones well I'll find that article and
[01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:31.440]  put that on screen so with this backdrop of lawlessness there's the
[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:36.080]  headline federal judge BLM engage in a criminal conspiracy against ranchers
[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:41.600]  court opinion exposes BLM's true intent against Clive and Bundy for 20 years the
[01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:45.600]  Bureau of Land Management engaged in a literal intentional conspiracy close
[01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:49.520]  quote against Nevada ranchers to force them out of business according to federal
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:54.800]  judge whose court opinion exposes the BLM's true intent against rancher
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:12:00.440]  Clive and Bundy and then it goes into the federal judge Jones and the court
[01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:05.480]  ruling even deals with other ranchers in his area forced out you can build a
[01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:10.880]  coal power plant but we will raise taxes to bankrupt you we will bankrupt you
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:16.600]  now who does that bankrupt us this is total mafia takeover that's the rest of
[01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:22.720]  the story but what is the system prey on the ignorance that if you had it when
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:27.400]  it was a territory the grazing and forage rights it's a low deal it's
[01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:34.240]  passed on it's inviolate that's land rights under the UN UNESCO worldwide they
[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:39.640]  don't recognize even pure tile total ownership of mineral surface water
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:51.440]  forage entrance this is a total annihilation of property rights that
[01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:56.240]  we're facing and Clive and Bundy is joining us I want to play this clip of
[01:12:56.240 --> 01:13:00.840]  Harry Reid saying he is a domestic terrorist and now they're beaten
[01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:04.600]  wargrounds for congressional hearings and I guess a federal expeditionary force
[01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:09.800]  I guess they're going to use the army next I mean we got to say no at some
[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:13.560]  point all we've been doing is laying down where's that been getting us let's
[01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:19.760]  go to that club so these people will hold themselves out to be patriots or not
[01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:24.400]  there's nothing more than domestic terrorists and I think that we are a
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:28.760]  country that people should follow the law and what went up in the ski is not
[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:34.120]  very good I repeat what went up there is domestic tourism okay their domestic
[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:39.320]  terrorism not tourism all right and it's real funny to the cowardly crowd there
[01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:43.120]  we have another clip of him on another television show this weekend called
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:46.160]  what's your point where he says more but we only got him at the bottom of the
[01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:50.120]  hour so let's go to him the rancher at the center of all this what could end up
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:55.000]  being the new legionner concord thank god it was no violence but it was epic
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:00.160]  beyond any movie I've ever seen it was the stuff of legends and he joins us
[01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:05.080]  now from his ranch Clive and what do you make of the escalation of words by a
[01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:11.800]  mr. Reed well I think he's right I guess we are well I don't say yes we are
[01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:17.240]  domestic violence there's the violence I guess they call we the people standing
[01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:21.100]  up for a right and put marching marching towards the government and their
[01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:27.400]  guns we did do that that's for sure well I call that being heroes just to
[01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:31.280]  everyone should admire you March Indians people that murdered children at
[01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:36.360]  Waco the same federal government saying we will shoot you and the image of the
[01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:39.920]  American flags and you were taking back the American flag there and having it
[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:43.360]  actually symbolize what America's supposed to stand for this is the stuff
[01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:48.000]  that John Wayne wishes he was this is the stuff John Wayne tried to mimic I'm
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:53.200]  not putting down John Wayne I mean how can they call you an American well they
[01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:58.080]  can't call us an American because people just stood in the walk and and they
[01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:04.000]  with their faith they report based danger and you know I mean I don't know
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:09.440]  how you can face any danger more danger than a crazy bureaucrat with a gun
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:14.640]  pointing it out here and the finger on the trigger and now these people were
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:19.560]  we're moving that way towards them moving apart towards them they pushed
[01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:23.480]  them out of the county and out of our state and they're gone but they still
[01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:27.840]  have their guns they said you know the sheriff ever did his duty and they bring
[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:31.000]  sheriffs and counties didn't do their duty these people are still moving
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:38.160]  across America ready to join with other bureaucratic army and these
[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:42.200]  bureaucracies have got their own army and you know you talked about it with your
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:48.040]  people they have created probably the strongest army in the world right here
[01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:53.840]  within the American people American people will be faced against American
[01:15:53.840 --> 01:16:00.480]  people before long if this is not straightened out what you say is
[01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:06.600]  absolutely true you know Glenn Beck and we'll cue this clip up a few years ago
[01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:10.880]  said that the government's planning on staging a new Oklahoma City well based
[01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:15.080]  on the Democratic Party are and then blaming him and us and I agree that they
[01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:19.920]  clearly are that that's how they want to frame us but now he's gotten so scared
[01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:25.360]  he's basically agreeing that this is terrorism that you guys would dare be
[01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:29.440]  out there or that Harry Reid's involved with his sons in land grabs when
[01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:33.160]  that's indisputable and that your land was supposed to be part of the set aside
[01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:37.560]  not for the solar panels but for the environmental easement that they use one
[01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:43.720]  part of the land and then use yours as the reserve under the UN Treaty and he
[01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:48.120]  basically said we should just lay down and let them run the final family off
[01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:53.640]  of there and implied that we would lynch him if we were in control of the
[01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:57.320]  country I don't know if you saw those clips but we played those last week I'm
[01:16:57.320 --> 01:17:01.880]  not bashing Glenn Beck here I'm just offending us I'm not calling for offensive
[01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:05.560]  violence and Clive and I don't think you're calling for offensive violence
[01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:10.560]  yeah let me explain something about the terrorist you know Harry Reid and his
[01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:15.200]  army sent we the people up as being terrorists and how they did it so they
[01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:19.960]  did it by designating a set area you know you've heard me call them big
[01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:25.480]  bids work we were able to exercise our First Amendment rights only in those
[01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:31.640]  areas they were little just so pens like 50-plus square only in those areas
[01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:35.920]  could we exercise our the First Amendment rights if we exercise our First
[01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:40.720]  Amendment rights out on this demand that is great that public land of Clark
[01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:46.120]  County and upon my ranks ranks any place we did that we would be
[01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:52.400]  categorized under almost a court home security law as territory in other
[01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:58.040]  words they've already made codes and laws that if we don't obey them we were
[01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:02.280]  going to be terrorists though again in one more sense Harry Reid is right
[01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:06.400]  part of their law and wrote their court once we said anything outside of those
[01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:11.400]  boxes we are domestic terrorists and they they set us up to be that and the
[01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:16.320]  reason they did that is they figured under the language domestic terrorists
[01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:21.920]  they had unlimited power they can shoot us they could the rest of they could put
[01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:25.800]  her head in the gravel and they felt like they were covered by their code of
[01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:31.920]  law Clive and buddy's our guest under the NDAA Obama claims with his executive
[01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:36.480]  order he can arrest and disappear and kill any citizen he wants making him
[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:42.960]  basically God Emperor like Kim Jong-un of North Korea expanding on that we now
[01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:46.600]  have the Homeland Security documents where they say land rights groups
[01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:52.120]  veterans and others are the number one enemy and now Harry Reid leader of the
[01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:57.680]  US Senate more important even than the Speaker of the House probably number
[01:18:57.680 --> 01:19:05.240]  three in the government undoubtedly number three saying that you are domestic
[01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:09.440]  terrorists and anyone that engaged in civil disobedience is I believe this is
[01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:14.480]  a declaration of war and basically part of the rollout declaring the American
[01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:17.800]  people the enemy now the White House counterterrorism chief has come out
[01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:22.560]  last week we play the audio last hour saying don't trust your children parents
[01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:28.640]  they may be terrorist so everyone's a terrorist but the occupied federal
[01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:35.320]  government sir yeah and I think Harry did declare civil war in his language
[01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:41.640]  he declared civil war against we the people and you know that's I hope it
[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:46.200]  well that's what he's doing that he's actually irritating he's turning the
[01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:50.240]  pot and what them and I can't understand in any human being doing that but Harry
[01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:54.400]  Reid is doing that he's turning the pot and he is you know I don't know what
[01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:58.400]  he's doing behind scenes but we know what in front of scenes where we know
[01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:03.200]  that they had these bureaucrats were armed well armed and they were prepared
[01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:07.880]  to kill and they were they were very tempted to kill and you know these
[01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:11.400]  people just that courage enough to push them up walk through them and push them
[01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:17.320]  out of here are there still be here and it's still be tempted to kill us five
[01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:21.960]  and bunnies are guest here's the message I want to telegraph to the feds you
[01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:26.960]  really are run by foreign banks that have signed us on to 1.5 quadrillion the
[01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:31.560]  Republic is being overthrown no one can debate that now Congress has a six
[01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:36.400]  percent approval rating nine on the high side you may not be a bad man or woman
[01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:40.000]  and I'm not your enemy I want you to have long days pleasant nights live long
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:45.760]  and prosper to quote Spock but you're going to push the American people to the
[01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:49.480]  breaking point and you're going to get a civil war that you believe is going to
[01:20:49.480 --> 01:20:53.440]  be some glorious victory once and for all like the Bolsheviks had over Russia
[01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:57.880]  it is not going to go that way and so on everybody realized not just the feds
[01:20:57.880 --> 01:21:02.720]  but everybody the point we're at I am so glad and literally hit my knees and
[01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:07.080]  thank God when the fed stood down they should continue to do the right thing
[01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:11.320]  and and and Clive and what is your message of the feds a and then be are
[01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:18.560]  you aware that fifty state reps and others met over the weekend I guess it
[01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:24.400]  was in Salt Lake City to discuss the western states basically kicking the
[01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:29.400]  feds out well the first thing I have to say and the main thing I have to say is
[01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:31.800]  the same message I give last week
[01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:35.880]  share County Sheriff's take the guns away from these bureaucrats these
[01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:41.280]  bureaucracy take those guns away in one county at a time you've got to take up

[01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:50.480]  the people it's your job to take them away and Harry Reid for hell's sake

[01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:05.600]  principle here of us for getting forgive and that we need to remember that

[01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:50.240]  me tell the bureaucrat you have a first or second amendment right this the same
[01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:54.680]  as we do but we want you to carry guns we want you to carry guns as a citizen
[01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:59.640]  but not not as a bureaucrat employed by the United States government you have
[01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:03.560]  no jurisdiction or authority you have no police in power you have no resting
[01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:09.600]  power you the county sheriff or each county there's the only man with that
[01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:16.040]  power and we the people have elected them and pay them and we tell them to get
[01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:21.360]  out from under the desk and protect our life liberty and property and at this
[01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:26.280]  moment in America and across the world nothing's more important than to disarm
[01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:33.680]  the bureaucrat I agree with you sir I'm looking at the Christian Science Monitor
[01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:39.280]  article and it says the transfer public lands act signed a law by Utah Governor
[01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:44.920]  Gary Herbert in 2012 set the stage for formal showdown with the government by
[01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:49.920]  demanding action under the threat of lawsuit and the Salt Lake City Tribune
[01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:54.080]  has an even better article about the 50-plus legislators meeting this weekend
[01:23:54.080 --> 01:24:00.200]  calling for the almost 90% of Nevada's federal 62% of Alaska
[01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:10.800]  she's 7% of Utah Oregon's 53 Idaho 62 Arizona 42 California is 48 Wyoming is
[01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:16.240]  48 New Mexico 35 Colorado 36 what is the federal government doing having half
[01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:22.880]  the land out west under their control and trying me let me explain that to you
[01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:27.160]  say they have over half of the land but let me tell you something they're
[01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:31.760]  managing you know you go back in your Constitution in five minutes you can't
[01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:35.920]  find any evidence that says that you can study that thing for the rest of your
[01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:39.960]  life and that's Constitution no I know I know I know they kept them as
[01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:44.360]  territories and they've been operating them as territories no I know that land
[01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:48.400]  supposed to be state land and then the state's supposed to give it out to the
[01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:52.840]  people and that's what's whoever's is productive and proves they're gonna use
[01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:57.560]  it gets it whoever pays taxes gets it not a far and run federal government I
[01:24:57.560 --> 01:25:00.880]  understand that I want to play you a clip of Glenn Beck here sir talking
[01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:06.080]  about the Democrats staging terror attacks to blame us now he's saying
[01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:10.480]  anybody that criticizes the government might be a terrorist he agrees with Harry
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:15.520]  Reid basically and so I believe through fear he's caving in and lining up with
[01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:22.840]  the other side here it is how can the left win the country watch cabinets
[01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:26.320]  don't don't really sell things president himself has to reconnect with the
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:31.000]  people remember president Clinton reconnected through Oklahoma right and
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:35.680]  the president is removed and it wasn't until that speech that he
[01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:40.600]  clicked with the American public Obama needs a similar a similar words of
[01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:48.760]  work for Obama needs a similar kind of event oh like Oklahoma City I will be
[01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:53.600]  the guy who causes the next Oklahoma City this is in a letter an appeal to
[01:25:53.600 --> 01:26:00.480]  advertisers of Fox dear Fox advertisers read this part of it no one left
[01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:04.720]  right center wants to see another Oklahoma City the next assassin may
[01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:09.880]  succeed if so there will be blood on many hands they are setting up another
[01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:14.080]  Oklahoma City they are claiming that one is coming and they've already marked
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:20.240]  the one who caused it I will be the guy who causes the next Oklahoma City all
[01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:24.440]  right now again I want Glenn Beck to be a good guy and he does a lot of good work
[01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:28.200]  I don't want to be his enemy but when he comes out and says the Alex Jones group
[01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:32.080]  once violence I played this last week don't be part of that group I'm the one
[01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:35.760]  saying I don't want violence but we can't just have the feds pointing guns at
[01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:39.960]  people shooting a teenager on a bicycle and killing them out there the BLM
[01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:44.600]  beating people up tasering people free speech zones acting like an occupying
[01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:51.520]  North Korean Army and being militarized and Glenn is now scared and knows that
[01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:55.000]  they're getting ready to start the Civil War and he thinks that he can have his
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:58.760]  movie production company and write ghost books those written books and that
[01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:02.520]  they're gonna leave him alone no Glenn they're gonna come after you too so
[01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:07.280]  throwing me under the bus saying that I want violence or that Bundy wants it is
[01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:12.360]  not really what's going on what do you say to that Clive and Bundy well it's
[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:17.160]  a little bit confusing why Glenn would would say what he's saying it seems to
[01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:22.440]  me like maybe he's wanting wanting to be the hero here the one thing for sure
[01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:26.200]  Clive and Bundy don't want to be the hero here but I do want to make we the
[01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:31.720]  people a hero and I don't know all these all these things I can't comment
[01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:38.480]  no no for sure but I do know one thing for sure that we do not want a civil war
[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:44.160]  and we do not want we just want a big government calm down here and we'll
[01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:49.000]  work things out so we're not even negotiating move we're not done and
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:53.640]  negotiate with big we're not going to negotiate with BLM we're only going to
[01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:57.760]  back up and strengthen our county sheriff and hope he does his job and
[01:27:57.760 --> 01:28:05.760]  that's where our Constitution put us you know Sean Kennedy said our militia and
[01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:12.400]  the people were the last form of defense because I said no Sean they are the
[01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:17.080]  first form of defense and I think before we're finding that we the people in
[01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:23.360]  our militia here we are the first form first force and our sheriff is got to be
[01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:27.680]  right there with us that's the way I believe well I gotta say I want to come
[01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:32.840]  in Sean Hannity because he's been really bad a lot of issues but he has a lot of
[01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:36.600]  courage doing the right thing here and so I appreciate him being supportive of
[01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:40.560]  this but I think it's because he's a former blue collar worker and understands
[01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:44.280]  property rights and understands that they've already ruined everybody else
[01:28:44.280 --> 01:28:48.640]  how big a deal is it that federal judge Jones we have the ruling on info wars
[01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:53.680]  calm said the BLM is involved in a criminal conspiracy to bankrupt every
[01:28:53.680 --> 01:28:57.760]  rancher in Nevada I think that's important evidence sir yeah you know I
[01:28:57.760 --> 01:29:02.920]  want to go back to Sean you know definitely he's my favorite hero and
[01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:08.160]  he's supported me and this movement and I appreciated and love him for it I
[01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:12.680]  appreciate that supporting matter percent but I was pointing out Sean that he was
[01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:17.560]  wrong in this one nation that we the people are on top of the flagpole not
[01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:22.120]  not the bottom we're not the last through the first night he's Sean only to
[01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:26.160]  there's that example I think Sean understood it and I think he may be
[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:31.000]  understood I disagree with you I believe we're the first and the last well we
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:35.160]  could be that too but we definitely are the first not the last I've got one more
[01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:38.280]  question for you on the other side we'll let you go here five more minutes I want
[01:29:38.280 --> 01:29:41.640]  to ask Clive and Bundy about how he expects them to come back at him now

[01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:37.720]  all of you and I've got a bunch of other geopolitical news and police state
[01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:41.880]  news I haven't gotten to yet now Harry Reid said last Thursday night we wrote
[01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:45.040]  an article about it drudge report calm picked it up Friday it was one of the
[01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:49.240]  biggest stories ever on info wars because people are interested in this
[01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:52.960]  information just saying that Clive and buddy and his supporters are domestic
[01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:58.640]  terrorist then he went on an NBC affiliate out of Vegas this weekend a
[01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:05.280]  show called what's your point and called them violent domestic terrorist
[01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:10.600]  wannabes so now it's not that they're terroristic it's they are terrorist
[01:34:10.600 --> 01:34:15.920]  clearly defamation but this is part of the rebranding you don't want your kids
[01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:19.520]  being taught two plus two equals five in common core or taught how to put a
[01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:23.160]  condom on the six years old your terrorist you don't want open borders
[01:34:23.160 --> 01:34:27.360]  your terrorist you don't want to pay for banker bailouts your terrorist you
[01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:32.000]  don't get in your free speech zone and shut up your terrorist let's go ahead and
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:36.080]  go to this clip because this will give mr. bunny a chance to respond he's not
[01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:42.800]  heard this new clip here it is if there were ever an example of people who were
[01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:48.680]  domestic violent terrorist wannabes these are the guys and I think that we
[01:34:48.680 --> 01:34:54.080]  should call it that way we have a situation where I think that it's really
[01:34:54.080 --> 01:34:58.880]  untoward would it be appropriate if Jim Rogers owner this station got behind in
[01:34:58.880 --> 01:35:02.920]  his taxes or had a problem with federal communications commission to station
[01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:08.000]  around here when people tried to collect taxes or to do something that was in
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:12.800]  keeping with the law and surround this place with armed people of course not
[01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:17.800]  and remember not only did Bundy do what I've just said there are two valid
[01:35:17.800 --> 01:35:23.760]  court orders a permanent junction get the cattle off the land yeah yeah federal
[01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:29.560]  courts ruling on federal land grabs you have another federal ruling in Nevada
[01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:34.680]  from the year before saying was a criminal conspiracy headline judge says
[01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:40.280]  BLM involved in criminal conspiracy in Nevada info wars.com with links to AP
[01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:45.200]  Reuters you name it in fact we'll scroll down I'll give you the name of that
[01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:51.200]  judge that is in the article in his opinion United States versus the state
[01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:56.360]  of Hague US district court judge Robert C. Jones reveals that after late Nevada
[01:35:56.360 --> 01:36:00.920]  Rancher E. Wayne Hage and then it just breaks down the whole criminal
[01:36:00.920 --> 01:36:07.280]  conspiracy against him so go read that for yourself going back to Cliven Bundy
[01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:11.920]  Cliven would it be appropriate for the TV station owner if every other TV
[01:36:11.920 --> 01:36:15.560]  station had been put out of business in the state because of special taxes on
[01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:20.200]  the TV station would it be appropriate for him to say First Amendment I'm not
[01:36:20.200 --> 01:36:24.680]  going to pay these taxes that that that are A unconstitutional B selectively
[01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:29.840]  enforced and C that are designed to bankrupt me I mean I guess you should
[01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:33.920]  like the other 52 families just go bankrupt and go crawl in the ditch with
[01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:38.600]  you and your wife and die or go to Vegas and go on welfare wouldn't that be the
[01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:43.240]  proper thing for you to do sir is to let the BLM point guns at you and let the
[01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:47.360]  BLM beat people up and let them put people in free speech zones isn't that
[01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:52.880]  the honorable thing to do mr. Bundy well it is my choice I guess that's one thing
[01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:57.320]  that I can say for America I could have done those things I could have done those
[01:36:57.320 --> 01:37:03.080]  things 20 years ago but I didn't do those things and these people that were
[01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:08.040]  behind me was behind me because I didn't do those things and they were behind me
[01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:12.520]  because they was tired and having those things done to my neighbors and all
[01:37:12.520 --> 01:37:17.520]  across United States were being abused by this government big government with
[01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:22.440]  unlimited power unlimited power unlimited power is the word for what
[01:37:22.440 --> 01:37:26.520]  they're exercising here it's not constitutional it's not within our state
[01:37:26.520 --> 01:37:32.040]  sovereignty not within their state laws and Harry but read I can't imagine he
[01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:35.760]  keeps about talking and acting like this if there's anything that would
[01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:40.240]  represent terrorist against this government it would have to be those
[01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:47.880]  bureaucrats with those big guns but in person like a foreign army against we
[01:37:47.880 --> 01:37:53.920]  the people that seems to be terrorist to me and it's actually terrifying and it
[01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:58.360]  was terrifying to them with the man and women that stood in line and marched
[01:37:58.360 --> 01:38:03.360]  towards those guns it was terrifying with their courage and how they had that
[01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:07.400]  much courage I don't know but they they did have the courage to do that you
[01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:11.280]  remember Clive and London he wasn't in the front line he was sitting over on
[01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:15.520]  the stage you wait until it's to happen I'm very concerned about what might
[01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:21.000]  happen so you know I do I can't say I had the courage they had the courage and
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:26.160]  they was doing it they was facing the United States Army gun are the
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:30.560]  bureaucrats which is what's the difference is it rockles army within the
[01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:34.640]  people is that any different than rockles army against say you a foreign
[01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:39.040]  nation it's there should be a lot of difference one is constitutional the
[01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:47.480]  otherness toward tyranny mr. Bundy we saw the feds back now and under the
[01:38:47.480 --> 01:38:53.720]  under the overwhelming righteousness of the people but in closing how do you
[01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:58.520]  expect Harry Reid to come back at you in the future what do you expect them to
[01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:03.360]  pull now that he's rightfully saying they cannot allow this to stand they have
[01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:07.000]  to keep us intimidated they have to put paramilitary forces out there to make
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:10.640]  sure that you know that they are in control of everything so that their
[01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:15.280]  despotism is complete they have to have their occupying armies basically
[01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:19.120]  squatting on top of us when they take the pension funds when they take the
[01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:23.040]  Social Security when they take the military benefits when they fully break
[01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:27.560]  the nation which is coming up very soon under homeland security that's their job
[01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:32.800]  they've they can't have the revolution start with a bunch of cowboys and a
[01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:37.520]  bunch of men women and children it's too iconic it's too wholesome it's too good
[01:39:37.520 --> 01:39:42.920]  so how do they destroy you how do they defeat you and show the world how
[01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:48.040]  pathetic Americans are how do they do that without having it backfire on them
[01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:55.080]  what do you expect them to do I expect them to blow something up and maybe even
[01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:59.640]  readle attack his own offices and then blame it on you I study these criminals
[01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:04.480]  and their criminology that's what I think you better watch out for but they
[01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:08.720]  can't do that because of people like you and you know
[01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:16.760]  people people of you your your integrity and your business integrity will not
[01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:21.360]  allow that to happen and that's why you're so important the way the people
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:24.400]  are important because we're not going to let it happen and you can see that we
[01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:32.960]  were ready to march with our faith and courage and militia there's a back in
[01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:37.080]  us and the militia is going to help back with the people we hope our county
[01:40:37.080 --> 01:40:42.400]  sheriff's were back as and you know that's as much energy and power as we
[01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:49.000]  need so hurry if you got something we get with it we're ready and that's the
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:54.920]  bottom line first they're gonna try to demonize you in the press and glorify
[01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:59.080]  all of their tyranny but I mean what does your gut tell you how do you think
[01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:02.200]  they'll come after you I don't think they'll kill you out of hand shoot you
[01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:06.040]  in the back even though they love to because that would make you a martyr
[01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:10.120]  how do you think they're gonna come after you well you know what I think I
[01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:15.560]  think Harry's gonna jump up and down and I think America Congress is gonna say
[01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:20.560]  hey Harry you're you're out of whack we you know you I have enough faith in
[01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:24.280]  those people who think that there's enough of them it's gonna say Harry we're
[01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:28.360]  not gonna stand you can't act like that and represent us and I don't know what
[01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:33.240]  the president United States is gonna do it's hard to hard to tell the state of
[01:41:33.240 --> 01:41:38.640]  Nevada Utah Arizona Wyoming California all these Western states I think they're
[01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:44.000]  going to say we're this is enough let me tell you who supports me more than
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:48.880]  anybody else even my local community when we have a get-together here like we
[01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:54.280]  had last Friday you know who's here the people from Pennsylvania New York
[01:41:54.280 --> 01:42:00.600]  Eastern Coast are representing more than like leaving my neighboring town those
[01:42:00.600 --> 01:42:04.640]  people are bringing their wives and they're shaking my hand and I'm hugging
[01:42:04.640 --> 01:42:08.440]  their women they're not they're not people from the west they're people from
[01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:12.880]  the east and the emails are coming from all over the world the world is
[01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:17.560]  watching us they want to find out if we really do have liberty and freedom here
[01:42:17.560 --> 01:42:22.640]  in the United States they want to know if we really have a Constitution that's
[01:42:22.640 --> 01:42:28.120]  been inspired by our dog they want to know these things and it's our job and
[01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:33.920]  your job is a broadcaster to let the world know and that's how come you're
[01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:39.200]  so important in in my life and in the life of America well Clive and you're
[01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:41.560]  important in what your sons and daughters standing up with those great
[01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:46.400]  Americans is what's important but I you know really it's the audience we have
[01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:52.320]  to think yeah I think it's we the people that's for sure it's we the people well
[01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:55.640]  when I bring up the false flags that's really all they've got is doing
[01:42:55.640 --> 01:42:59.800]  something to try to frame us doing something and try to blame us for but
[01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:06.720]  the example that you've said will continue to grow and here's the good
[01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:11.000]  news they just had a meeting this weekend with over 50 state legislators moving
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:17.840]  to create a larger movement to take back the state land from the feds and
[01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:22.960]  that's a very popular idea so this can really backfire on the establishment on
[01:43:22.960 --> 01:43:26.760]  so many fronts and here's my final point the globalist better understand this is
[01:43:26.760 --> 01:43:30.720]  not Russia this is not other countries where they've gotten away with this if
[01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:36.480]  they start a civil war we're going to take the country back and we're going to
[01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:41.840]  prosecute the bosses that gave the orders our enemy is not even the feds
[01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:46.280]  or the police that will follow illegal orders though that they will be dealt
[01:43:46.280 --> 01:43:52.000]  with obviously unfortunately it's the people that that spun the web gave the
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:57.120]  orders they're not going to be safe in Switzerland or Luxembourg or London or
[01:43:57.120 --> 01:44:03.280]  Russia or Israel or in Asia the globalist when this is all said and done
[01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:08.360]  are going to be brought to justice under a court of law final comments on that
[01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:14.560]  mr. Bundy well that you know I have no way to predict what's gonna happen all
[01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:19.280]  I know of this is a world the world is concerned the world is watching us and
[01:44:19.280 --> 01:44:25.840]  I think the world is ready to defend us and I and one thing I have learned that
[01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:30.160]  each individual in this world is very important and their individuals and they
[01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:35.320]  do need to be able to exercise their conscience and have some freedoms of
[01:44:35.320 --> 01:44:41.880]  liberty and our constitution is a constitution that is framed by our
[01:44:41.880 --> 01:44:47.800]  heavenly father for that purpose to give each individual freedom and that will
[01:44:47.800 --> 01:44:53.520]  happen very well said well it comes down to this it's civil disobedience even if
[01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:56.000]  you didn't have the grazing rights going back a hundred and something years
[01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:01.120]  like you do on record the people have voted the people don't like the feds
[01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:04.480]  have a nine percent of land in Nevada they don't like them kicking a producer
[01:45:04.480 --> 01:45:08.800]  office producing beef they're sick of the country going bankrupt and they're
[01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:13.680]  tired of the free speech zones the police dogs the snipers the tasering the
[01:45:13.680 --> 01:45:19.160]  people have voted we're ready to walk up against your guns and if you want to go
[01:45:19.160 --> 01:45:22.960]  ahead and shoot us you guys playing soldier go ahead you shoot the first
[01:45:22.960 --> 01:45:26.920]  shot but to quote one fellow that spoke at the county commissioners there will
[01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:31.600]  fire all the others we don't want a war but if you think we're going to live on
[01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:35.240]  our knees the slaves you got another thing coming mr. Bundy thank you so
[01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:40.800]  much for the time anything else you'd like to add well you know what I want
[01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:46.040]  to stress or you follow our constitution you figured out what it has to do with
[01:45:46.040 --> 01:45:52.200]  land and sovereign and peace and power and the United States authority and
[01:45:52.200 --> 01:45:58.400]  jurisdiction which is limited very very small you understand that and our
[01:45:58.400 --> 01:46:02.440]  founding fathers fought this battle for us and they give us a blueprint and
[01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:07.600]  things like them wanting our states wanting to get our their land back they
[01:46:07.600 --> 01:46:11.880]  can't get something they already have and they can't ask Congress they can't
[01:46:11.880 --> 01:46:16.360]  ask the president can't ask the beautiful system to give their land back when
[01:46:16.360 --> 01:46:20.600]  they're all when it's already there exactly the solution and state would give
[01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:25.720]  that to them and the hoax that the feds are God when the feds on top of it are
[01:46:25.720 --> 01:46:30.080]  far and run now is over mr. Bundy thank you so much thank you so much we're
[01:46:30.080 --> 01:46:34.440]  praying for you and you've got our phone number I'm ready to send reporters out
[01:46:34.440 --> 01:46:37.920]  there as soon as you think this thing is heating up I'm ready to jump on a
[01:46:37.920 --> 01:46:43.440]  plane to come out there as well in fact I may just come out there so I look
[01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:47.440]  forward to shaking your hands soon mr. Bundy I appreciate that and thank you
[01:46:47.440 --> 01:46:52.200]  and thank your audience and thank you the world and thank you America the
[01:46:52.200 --> 01:46:56.080]  beautiful have a beautiful day you too there goes Clive and Monday just a
[01:46:56.080 --> 01:47:02.760]  truly good Christian man and everybody sees that and you know he's ready and he
[01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:07.480]  doesn't have any fear we're gonna go to John and then Daniel and then Mike and
[01:47:07.480 --> 01:47:11.280]  then Alvin and Darren we're gonna get to all of you open phones in the next
[01:47:11.280 --> 01:47:14.520]  hour I'm gonna go to your calls here in a moment but open phones all next hour
[01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:19.560]  interspersed with other important news but again people say all some guy and
[01:47:19.560 --> 01:47:24.720]  cows who cares this is about land rights it's about not being pushed anymore and
[01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:32.760]  you know Obama just legalized most the illegals by fiat outside of Congress and
[01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:37.080]  Obama is you know forgiving all these foreign debts of other groups everything
[01:47:37.080 --> 01:47:42.080]  dictatorially but then meanwhile you've got all the ranchers run out with a
[01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:48.200]  federal judge ruling that that they did it on purpose I mean a bunch of guys
[01:47:48.200 --> 01:47:52.760]  show up with guns to run everyone out over the last 20 years and one guy will
[01:47:52.760 --> 01:47:58.040]  not be run out and CNN and the rest of them are hoping that you're ignorant and
[01:47:58.040 --> 01:48:04.120]  don't know about the whole story the problem is people like Matt Drudge
[01:48:04.120 --> 01:48:07.280]  aren't going along with it and I will cover this at the bottom of the next
[01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:11.960]  hour the documents have now been released the Clinton papers have now
[01:48:11.960 --> 01:48:17.600]  been released from 20 something years ago dreading and fearing the internet
[01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:22.880]  and Matt Drudge while telling you you don't have any power well look they
[01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:26.360]  can't just take out Matt Drudge now because there's Alex Jones and there's
[01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:30.800]  a hundred other big sites they're not gonna shut us up it's over the only
[01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:37.640]  question is globalist how bad is it going to get how bad is it going to get
[01:48:37.640 --> 01:48:42.480]  before we just fix things everybody knows we're going the wrong direction
[01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:46.920]  everybody knows this corruption is growing everybody knows that foreign
[01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:49.960]  interests are running rough shot up with the country I mean the guy that got
[01:48:49.960 --> 01:48:54.080]  the formula one built outside Austin with something like I forget those like
[01:48:54.080 --> 01:48:58.360]  300 million in taxpayer money and then there was a 100 million extra I mean it
[01:48:58.360 --> 01:49:03.640]  just the guy gave his daughters as a gift the same year three billion dollars
[01:49:03.640 --> 01:49:09.760]  and bought them the largest houses respectively two houses the two largest
[01:49:09.760 --> 01:49:14.920]  in the US on the West Coast on top of the three billion dollar gift and it
[01:49:14.920 --> 01:49:22.320]  turned out Eccleston's his name he had the racetracks built all over the world
[01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:28.800]  by government and then he makes huge profits on top of it he just was
[01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:34.600]  basically given the land given the money given everything and then they'll
[01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:39.200]  take a whole ladies house if you didn't bear property taxes there it is
[01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:44.120]  Bernie Eccleston's daughters by most expensive house in the US and then they
[01:49:44.120 --> 01:49:50.080]  bought another house that was the second largest and hey good for you ladies but
[01:49:50.080 --> 01:49:54.360]  the issue is every time I turn around Jerry Jones as a stadium for a billion
[01:49:54.360 --> 01:50:02.160]  and a half smackers paid for it by me I got a family in Dallas that have been
[01:50:02.160 --> 01:50:05.520]  upper middle class and I hear about all the trouble they got paying their
[01:50:05.520 --> 01:50:16.200]  property taxes I mean I've got my family has to pay Jerry Jones money a guy's
[01:50:16.200 --> 01:50:22.720]  worth like six billion dollars and then we're gonna call Clive and Bundy a
[01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:26.240]  deadbeat the illegals get everything free the rich people get everything for
[01:50:26.240 --> 01:50:29.200]  free the only people that don't get something for free are people that bust
[01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:33.760]  their butts and I'm not even demonizing the illegals hell they're angels compared
[01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:36.760]  to the globalist they're only being brought up here so they can drive down
[01:50:36.760 --> 01:50:43.440]  wages once the US is imploded they're not gonna get anything of course a lot
[01:50:43.440 --> 01:50:46.920]  of the illegals are so proud they work super hard and do pay taxes and then
[01:50:46.920 --> 01:50:49.840]  don't get benefits but there's another group of the illegals that don't work

[01:55:59.720 --> 01:56:04.040]  Wisconsin and then I had a caller in Texas was gonna finish the story but I
[01:56:04.040 --> 01:56:08.800]  guess he hung up John in Wisconsin go ahead and give us your point that's a
[01:56:08.800 --> 01:56:14.800]  good thing I wasn't holding my breath actually Alex the line was crossed way
[01:56:14.800 --> 01:56:18.400]  back when Lincoln was assassinated I think and there were several ways you
[01:56:18.400 --> 01:56:24.960]  John after that they all been crossed and this latest one is probably start
[01:56:24.960 --> 01:56:29.320]  broke the camel back up people don't wake up now it's a fact that we're being
[01:56:29.320 --> 01:56:36.120]  manipulated for no good then you know the Wednesday or a week I'll have to take
[01:56:36.120 --> 01:56:40.520]  the burden but I think we should get the government's base stay in the
[01:56:40.520 --> 01:56:47.720]  government's base get time limits on the Senate and the House and we can use
[01:56:47.720 --> 01:56:55.040]  poster tells Harry and and Pelosi and you know the other ones that have been
[01:56:55.040 --> 01:57:00.200]  there way too long to begin with I hear you and I appreciate your call thanks
[01:57:00.200 --> 01:57:05.360]  for holding to say that I mean that's really the issue the people running the
[01:57:05.360 --> 01:57:10.080]  government are open criminals who get away with all sorts of crime and they're
[01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:14.520]  squeezing we the people and they want paramilitary police everywhere with the
[01:57:14.520 --> 01:57:18.200]  president set to go on our houses without warrants that's what the boss in
[01:57:18.200 --> 01:57:22.480]  bombing other things have done and they want to secure what they've stolen it's
[01:57:22.480 --> 01:57:26.480]  really that simple Mike in Wyoming we'll go to Daniel in Tennessee Mike are on
[01:57:26.480 --> 01:57:33.080]  the air yes hi Alex that when would the line be crossed I don't think it's going
[01:57:33.080 --> 01:57:39.080]  to be subtle when the day happens I think they need a major smokescreen to to
[01:57:39.080 --> 01:57:43.960]  cover the financial collapse that I think is the important component to their
[01:57:43.960 --> 01:57:51.920]  plan I as far as Mr. Bundy's concerned I just for him and for other ranchers out
[01:57:51.920 --> 01:57:56.160]  there who might find themselves in the same situation I just wonder if I mean
[01:57:56.160 --> 01:57:59.320]  he should never been in federal court in the first place and they're they're good
[01:57:59.320 --> 01:58:04.240]  outfits like the Paragon Foundation and others that protect property rights guys
[01:58:04.240 --> 01:58:08.080]  who've been through the mill before and know how to how to keep people out of
[01:58:08.080 --> 01:58:12.560]  trouble and I think they need to start subscribing to the that's a great point
[01:58:12.560 --> 01:58:15.520]  let's get the head of the Paragon Foundation on he's been on years ago
[01:58:15.520 --> 01:58:19.160]  nice listen to him on Derry Brownfield all the time that's that's a great point
[01:58:19.160 --> 01:58:22.760]  let's get the head of the Paragon Foundation on anything else there Mike
[01:58:22.760 --> 01:58:29.240]  yeah now Mr. Bundy should prefer charges against these guys who who has
[01:58:29.240 --> 01:58:33.680]  halted them in gunpoint and can start a Bivens action against them civilly
[01:58:33.680 --> 01:58:38.200]  these guys you know should should face some charges they won't stay there I'm
[01:58:38.200 --> 01:58:43.560]  gonna come right back to you then we'll get everybody else third hour open phones

[02:00:04.880 --> 02:00:12.520]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[02:00:12.520 --> 02:00:20.040]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:20.040 --> 02:00:25.560]  Alex Jones you know we knew this was going on with Benghazi but Kurt
[02:00:25.560 --> 02:00:33.640]  Nemo's written an article about it al Qaeda in Syria gets man pads for those
[02:00:33.640 --> 02:00:36.600]  who don't know that's the latest generation of service to air any
[02:00:36.600 --> 02:00:42.920]  aircraft missile stingers and we have a video Obama administration floated the
[02:00:42.920 --> 02:00:47.840]  PR campaign for weapons that were sent to them years ago and the word is that
[02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:52.880]  they leaked to him as well these are the newer ones at Benghazi we're gonna tie
[02:00:52.880 --> 02:00:56.720]  Benghazi into this that is a big deal that's coming up but let's go to the
[02:00:56.720 --> 02:01:00.760]  calls that have been holding a while opening the phones up I'd like to hear
[02:01:00.760 --> 02:01:04.440]  from you out there what is your line in the sand what do you think what is your
[02:01:04.440 --> 02:01:07.720]  gut tell you is gonna happen with the Bundy's do you agree with me this is a
[02:01:07.720 --> 02:01:12.920]  really watershed event and it's important which way it goes obviously
[02:01:12.920 --> 02:01:19.360]  800 259 92 31 first-time callers Mike and Wyoming you were finishing up your
[02:01:19.360 --> 02:01:26.880]  points yes still there Alex yes I am go ahead okay I was suggesting that the
[02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:32.680]  Bundy's since obviously Reed and and that the gang are not going to let this
[02:01:32.680 --> 02:01:40.880]  drop in fact it's now become imperative for them to to make a make a symbol out
[02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:47.240]  of Bundy you know Bundy should take the offensive here file charges
[02:01:47.240 --> 02:01:52.600]  where out charges against these bugs for assault with with weapons I mean there
[02:01:52.600 --> 02:01:55.960]  was no there was no reason for them to have their weapons drawn and pointed
[02:01:55.960 --> 02:02:02.040]  that the at the demonstrators there number two these people ran around some
[02:02:02.040 --> 02:02:05.600]  of them with the police on their jackets that's impersonating police they
[02:02:05.600 --> 02:02:10.560]  these feds no matter no matter how much authority they claim to have they are
[02:02:10.560 --> 02:02:15.320]  not police the federal government does not have municipal police powers period
[02:02:15.320 --> 02:02:19.520]  and and that again is something that the sheriff should address if he doesn't
[02:02:19.520 --> 02:02:23.840]  if I were Bundy I would I would try to get in front of a grand jury and and make
[02:02:23.840 --> 02:02:29.480]  my points there and and if nothing else you can pursue a civil action with a
[02:02:29.480 --> 02:02:34.320]  Bivens action against these federal agents for the for the damages that they
[02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:40.000]  did for the for the terrorism that they committed so Bundy should launch an
[02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:46.000]  offensive here and not wait for them to make the next move well I agree with
[02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:50.800]  that he should start some different court cases at the state level as well
[02:02:50.800 --> 02:02:56.000]  just to point out morally that the feds are out of control people say well the
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:00.840]  federal courts supersede the state only because they say so only because they've
[02:03:00.840 --> 02:03:05.480]  created this idea but look at the movement already now giving moral
[02:03:05.480 --> 02:03:10.840]  support to the state legislators to take the the ill-gotten federal land and to
[02:03:10.840 --> 02:03:15.320]  move forward with the state's rights movement in the West which is outrageously
[02:03:15.320 --> 02:03:21.920]  popular with we the people now is the time to to start putting our foot down
[02:03:21.920 --> 02:03:28.160]  on every front and get on the offense so they start backing off federal courts
[02:03:28.160 --> 02:03:33.160]  Alex our courts of limited jurisdiction they are they are article four courts
[02:03:33.160 --> 02:03:39.320]  created by Congress and they have jurisdiction over federal enclaves they
[02:03:39.320 --> 02:03:43.360]  only have it over federal enclaves the military and the borders and interstate
[02:03:43.360 --> 02:03:47.240]  commerce and they won't even operate over the things they're supposed to it's
[02:03:47.240 --> 02:03:51.080]  funny the Federal Reserve controls the currency when the Congress is supposed to
[02:03:51.080 --> 02:03:55.240]  they don't control the border even though they're supposed to they're putting
[02:03:55.240 --> 02:04:01.200]  all that into UN rulings now they're transferring the federal power to UNESCO
[02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:06.240]  in the UN they are engaged in the in the criminal takeover of this country and
[02:04:06.240 --> 02:04:10.840]  the transference to groups that are outside of this country also have
[02:04:10.840 --> 02:04:15.040]  authority if you give it to them if you show up in their courts go past the bar
[02:04:15.040 --> 02:04:19.440]  you've given them jurisdiction or if you if you petition them with your own
[02:04:19.440 --> 02:04:23.480]  action you've given them authority otherwise all these things should be
[02:04:23.480 --> 02:04:29.440]  dealt with in state courts well it's a complex issue you know I've seen federal
[02:04:29.440 --> 02:04:34.600]  courts just took a long time rule in favor of Nevada ranchers saying the BLM
[02:04:34.600 --> 02:04:40.680]  criminal that's not to say they're not it you know they can be fair but just
[02:04:40.680 --> 02:04:45.720]  assume stay out of it if you can well it's a very complex issue but overall I
[02:04:45.720 --> 02:04:49.640]  agree with you thank you so much Mike we're gonna come back and we're gonna go
[02:04:49.640 --> 02:04:56.840]  to everybody that's patiently holding Daniel and Darren and Alvin mill many
[02:04:56.840 --> 02:05:04.160]  others stay with us from the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself
[02:05:04.160 --> 02:05:08.480]  our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day but it's not
[02:05:08.480 --> 02:05:12.520]  just the air outside that's toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five
[02:05:12.520 --> 02:05:16.120]  times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most

[02:08:50.760 --> 02:08:53.800]  boss in bombing looking at that false flag and everything that happened there
[02:08:53.800 --> 02:08:58.680]  we don't air it today I'll air it tomorrow I need to get into the reports
[02:08:58.680 --> 02:09:03.360]  that we've got here Clinton files on media enemies have been released
[02:09:03.360 --> 02:09:07.280]  learn what Hillary meant by vast right-wing conspiracy they were scared
[02:09:07.280 --> 02:09:13.200]  of the internet period of world net daily and Matt drudge and that was when
[02:09:13.200 --> 02:09:16.960]  that was all just starting that oh my gosh we don't want them to have a voice
[02:09:16.960 --> 02:09:21.560]  they want everybody's silence so it looks like they're in control these people
[02:09:21.560 --> 02:09:25.960]  are not impossible to beat like they're quite easy to be if we just stand up
[02:09:25.960 --> 02:09:31.680]  against them speaking of dangerous remember when the terrorists were al-Qaeda
[02:09:31.680 --> 02:09:35.640]  and then we were pointing out hey you know the CIA and other governments
[02:09:35.640 --> 02:09:40.200]  Saudi Arabians especially are funding al-Qaeda and protecting them and using
[02:09:40.200 --> 02:09:47.160]  them as a secret army to overthrow the Serb areas in Kosovo to attack the
[02:09:47.160 --> 02:09:53.520]  Russians to attack areas in Europe and these are real jihadis real terrorists
[02:09:53.520 --> 02:09:57.960]  it's just that they're funded and protected three layers up by the West oh
[02:09:57.960 --> 02:10:04.600]  Alex how dare you say Dick Cheney had the plunger on 9-11 like Wiley-Kyle no
[02:10:04.600 --> 02:10:10.600]  that's not what I said they're criminal radical Muslim networks that are being
[02:10:10.600 --> 02:10:14.160]  protected in jihad centers here in the US I'm even gonna send some our
[02:10:14.160 --> 02:10:18.920]  reporters to one very soon that's in local news but not national news where
[02:10:18.920 --> 02:10:25.040]  they actually have training camps and they're left alone because they need that
[02:10:25.040 --> 02:10:33.160]  as a reason to take over Boston bombing the older brother was on the CIA payroll
[02:10:33.160 --> 02:10:37.160]  that came out in even British news the Russians blew his cover and said does
[02:10:37.160 --> 02:10:40.920]  this go work for you why is he allowed to fly with a fake passport and a fake name
[02:10:40.920 --> 02:10:47.480]  he was sheep dipped folks he had a fake name did you hear that funded by the
[02:10:47.480 --> 02:10:51.880]  State Department through Georgetown University to go over there and then oh
[02:10:51.880 --> 02:10:55.940]  we got to get rid of them the younger brothers said he's not guilty and they're
[02:10:55.940 --> 02:11:00.160]  keeping that trial secret under national security because he's in there
[02:11:00.160 --> 02:11:03.960]  saying he didn't do it and he was set up
[02:11:04.800 --> 02:11:09.080]  showed up you traitor we all know the government didn't do anything wrong now
[02:11:09.080 --> 02:11:14.320]  here's the headline in four wars calm al Qaeda in Syria gets anti-aircraft
[02:11:14.320 --> 02:11:22.120]  missiles or man pads Obama and men floats PR campaign for weapons sent years
[02:11:22.120 --> 02:11:27.940]  ago and they're announcing why they did it and it's actual Saudi Arabian real
[02:11:27.940 --> 02:11:31.120]  lobby al Qaeda let's play some of that video then I'm gonna go back to your
[02:11:31.120 --> 02:11:45.760]  calls video and audio here it is modern stingers unbelievable
[02:11:45.760 --> 02:12:01.480]  wow
[02:12:08.860 --> 02:12:14.560]  and there's videos of tow missiles anti-tank missiles and these guys shooting
[02:12:14.560 --> 02:12:23.960]  aircraft down? I mean, those are high-powered missiles. That thing must have gone 5,000
[02:12:23.960 --> 02:12:36.920]  feet. The globalists want our guns, and they want to call Bundy a terrorist, but these
[02:12:36.920 --> 02:12:43.840]  guys they're given weapons to. And they're saying if we don't overthrow Assad, Al Qaeda
[02:12:43.840 --> 02:12:50.840]  will nuke the West Coast, the East Coast. All right, that's enough. Please turn it off.
[02:12:50.840 --> 02:12:55.880]  I mean, it's so elementary what's going on. And I don't think the average police officer
[02:12:55.880 --> 02:13:02.040]  or average FBI agent or average person, even the CIA wants to be a part of this. Everyone
[02:13:02.040 --> 02:13:07.760]  has to remove their consent from this fraud. And this the enemy of my enemy is my friend.
[02:13:07.760 --> 02:13:12.920]  This is being used to overthrow our culture and bring a police state. All right, let's
[02:13:12.920 --> 02:13:20.840]  go to Daniel in Tennessee, listing on WBCR 1470 AM. I guess one of six affiliates we've
[02:13:20.840 --> 02:13:24.720]  got in Tennessee, a lot of stations in Tennessee for this show. I'm going to go to Daryl or
[02:13:24.720 --> 02:13:27.720]  Darren and others. Go ahead. You're on the air, Daniel.
[02:13:27.720 --> 02:13:32.920]  Thank you, Alex. First-time caller, and in 10 years I've been trying. As a colleague,
[02:13:32.920 --> 02:13:36.920]  I'll ask you for only 120 seconds. I can say what I can get on there.
[02:13:36.920 --> 02:13:37.920]  Go ahead, brother.
[02:13:37.920 --> 02:13:42.120]  First of all, the line has been drawn by the beds back when they kicked the church door
[02:13:42.120 --> 02:13:48.560]  in Idaho, back when they shot and killed some of the men in Montana, back at Ruby Ridge,
[02:13:48.560 --> 02:13:53.160]  back at Waco. They're the ones that drew the line in the sand and dared the American public
[02:13:53.160 --> 02:13:59.120]  to even think about crossing that line. The line has been drawn by them, and so many people
[02:13:59.120 --> 02:14:05.280]  have been coward until we hear somebody like Mr. Bundy come up and stand against them.
[02:14:05.280 --> 02:14:11.520]  And the Patriots with the militia, the well-armed militia. One more thing you need to know.
[02:14:11.520 --> 02:14:20.440]  I know for a fact that Harry Greed is a Mormon, and one of the 13 articles of faith are, do
[02:14:20.440 --> 02:14:25.920]  you believe, or we believe, in being honest with our fellow man in all our dealings at
[02:14:25.920 --> 02:14:32.520]  every time, all the time? And he is a Mormon. That's a fact. I know that. I have contacts
[02:14:32.520 --> 02:14:40.520]  in Las Vegas right now. So here is Harry Greed kind of hiding in the closet for what he
[02:14:40.520 --> 02:14:46.840]  supposedly, allegedly believes in. And to tell Mr. Bundy, please, that all of the stakes
[02:14:46.840 --> 02:14:51.640]  and the wards back here in the east are praying for him and his family. And lastly, Alex,
[02:14:51.640 --> 02:14:55.760]  I pray that they don't try to make a martyr out of you. That's worried us for years.
[02:14:55.760 --> 02:15:03.640]  Well, I appreciate your prayers, but all I'm doing is the best I can. And clearly, Mr.
[02:15:03.640 --> 02:15:07.920]  Bundy and his family and everybody are very good people. You can just see that, and it
[02:15:07.920 --> 02:15:13.560]  really upsets the system. And if they do decide to kill them or start the Civil War, it's
[02:15:13.560 --> 02:15:17.640]  the wrong poster child for the globalist. I mean, this is really not what they want.
[02:15:17.640 --> 02:15:22.160]  But if they don't crush him or demonize him, other people are going to stand up. And so
[02:15:22.160 --> 02:15:26.600]  they're stuck between a rock and a hard place. What does your gut tell you? Or you'd say
[02:15:26.600 --> 02:15:30.240]  as a Christian, your spirit, what does your gut tell you is going to happen at the end
[02:15:30.240 --> 02:15:36.320]  of the day here? I don't think we can tell because we have to make the decision on what
[02:15:36.320 --> 02:15:38.600]  we're going to do. I think that governs the future.
[02:15:38.600 --> 02:15:43.040]  But before you drop my call, I'd like to tell you, we carry your program three times in
[02:15:43.040 --> 02:15:48.160]  24 hours here to educate the public on Truth Radio. We do that because we believe in what
[02:15:48.160 --> 02:15:54.080]  you're doing, Alex, and other talk show hosts. And my gut feeling is before it's over, the
[02:15:54.080 --> 02:15:59.920]  feds are going to do exactly what they did in Montana, Ruby Ridge, Waco, and the church
[02:15:59.920 --> 02:16:04.880]  in Idaho. No matter what it takes, they're out to win because they're desperate. They're
[02:16:04.880 --> 02:16:10.720]  sorely afraid of a well armed militia under constitutional rights. Thank you.
[02:16:10.720 --> 02:16:14.360]  Very well said, sir. You're absolutely right. New article by Steve Watson just went up on
[02:16:14.360 --> 02:16:20.320]  infallwars.com and prisonplanet.com. Princeton researchers conclude U.S. political system
[02:16:20.320 --> 02:16:26.000]  has been almost completely usurped. They go on to say the U.S. is basically a police state
[02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:32.160]  run by special interest. Very important article by a prestigious university. And then meanwhile,
[02:16:32.160 --> 02:16:34.880]  we played this last hour. I'm not going to play it again because of time constraints.
[02:16:34.880 --> 02:16:38.280]  I want to go to calls where he says, hey, we got to keep you safe. So we're going to
[02:16:38.280 --> 02:16:44.320]  grope you and the NSA is going to spy on you without warrants. You can't say it's unconstitutional.
[02:16:44.320 --> 02:16:52.680]  They're giving modern stinger missiles to al-Qaeda, real al-Qaeda. So even the European Interpol
[02:16:52.680 --> 02:16:57.840]  says that they think it's going to start shooting airplanes down with. And when they start shooting
[02:16:57.840 --> 02:17:02.600]  down airplanes in the U.S. and Europe with these, I'm going to come on air and say, hey,
[02:17:02.600 --> 02:17:08.200]  we gave it to him and I will be called a traitor by MSNBC. You watch when it happens. I think
[02:17:08.200 --> 02:17:14.200]  it's going to happen. They will say, Alex Jones says the government did it. He isn't
[02:17:14.200 --> 02:17:21.480]  sad that 227 people died when this such 747 got shot down or flying out of Dallas or flying
[02:17:21.480 --> 02:17:27.520]  out of New York. It won't be that Alex predicted this and Alex was right and we shouldn't have
[02:17:27.520 --> 02:17:31.720]  given missiles to al-Qaeda. It will be how dare him not care about the dead women and
[02:17:31.720 --> 02:17:35.760]  children. Let's go to the father whose 12-year-old son was on the plane. What do you think of
[02:17:35.760 --> 02:17:40.760]  Alex Jones not caring about your dead son, Billy? Well, I hate Alex Jones. I mean, these
[02:17:40.760 --> 02:17:49.760]  people make me sick. And they've done this before we expose their false flags. Alex Jones
[02:17:49.760 --> 02:17:53.240]  doesn't care about the people that died. He thinks the fireman blew up the World Trade
[02:17:53.240 --> 02:17:58.000]  Center because he says the government was involved in it. I said criminal elements
[02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:03.520]  were involved ordering a stand down. And then we had police say, get back. They're going
[02:18:03.520 --> 02:18:12.720]  to blow up Building 7 on CNN. And then I interviewed the deputy head of emergency management.
[02:18:12.720 --> 02:18:21.160]  And two weeks later, he was dead. The family wouldn't talk to us. They moved out suddenly.
[02:18:21.160 --> 02:18:25.200]  We talked to the neighbors. I believe he didn't die. I was put in a witness protection program.
[02:18:25.200 --> 02:18:32.000]  Because when Barry Jennings came on this show, the video's online, when he came on this show
[02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:35.720]  and said, no, they said they were going to blow up Building 7, he was the number two in
[02:18:35.720 --> 02:18:41.320]  New York City in the building. And boy, when he did that, they didn't know what to do.
[02:18:41.320 --> 02:18:49.040]  So he was dead two weeks later. Maybe they killed him. I don't know. We went to their
[02:18:49.040 --> 02:18:54.360]  house, gone. Neighbors said, man, they had a moving truck out of here. They were gone.
[02:18:54.360 --> 02:18:58.600]  I don't know, folks. I'm in over my head. So is the whole world. And I'll tell the establishment
[02:18:58.600 --> 02:19:10.600]  something too. You are in over your head as well. You are in over your head. Man can't
[02:19:10.600 --> 02:19:14.560]  run this system. The globalists aren't going to get what I mean. Do you guys really think
[02:19:14.560 --> 02:19:17.040]  you're going to win a civil war? You know what? Harry Reid doesn't care about a bunch
[02:19:17.040 --> 02:19:25.040]  of cops and military get killed in a civil war. I do. I'm sick of them winning. I'm
[02:19:25.040 --> 02:19:29.160]  sick of knowing their trick and watching them play us off against each other. I literally
[02:19:29.160 --> 02:19:35.640]  have nightmares about this. You've heard me talk about this on and on. Even if you're
[02:19:35.640 --> 02:19:40.320]  able to beat the American people and bring in the system, I guarantee you a lot of feds
[02:19:40.320 --> 02:19:44.800]  are going to die. I know they got you all geared up in paramilitary and you're ready
[02:19:44.800 --> 02:19:50.560]  for a fight and you think it's manly and all this. Those are manly instincts misplaced.
[02:19:50.560 --> 02:19:56.920]  You should have the cultural and spiritual honor to realize you work for a foreign banking
[02:19:56.920 --> 02:20:03.600]  cartel that hijacked the country. That's what Princeton says. My name is Jessica Arman.
[02:20:03.600 --> 02:20:07.800]  I'm an activist, a GCN listener, and mother of three. Our drinking water and food are
[02:20:07.800 --> 02:20:11.760]  filled with fluoride and other contaminants that harm our teeth and gums. To protect
[02:20:11.760 --> 02:20:16.700]  my family, I created My Magic Mud, an all-natural teeth whitening and strengthening remedy.
[02:20:16.700 --> 02:20:21.120]  My Magic Mud is a soft powder that polishes your teeth, reduces sensitivity, and removes

[02:07:28.940 --> 02:24:35.720]  I do have some breaking news up at InfoWars.com. Incredible stories. Woman
[02:24:35.720 --> 02:24:41.200]  plans abortion for chance to win TV role. Misplaced priorities are commonplace in ancient
[02:24:41.200 --> 02:24:46.440]  civilizations before they collapsed. I want to get into that. US intelligence chief bars
[02:24:46.440 --> 02:24:53.400]  unauthorized contacts with reporters on all Intel related matters. So the system circling
[02:24:53.400 --> 02:24:58.880]  wagons to keep the press from learning of their criminal activities. What I just mentioned
[02:24:58.880 --> 02:25:03.880]  to Princeton researchers conclude US political system has been almost completely usurped.
[02:25:03.880 --> 02:25:10.480]  That's all up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com. But I've got more than that coming up after
[02:25:10.480 --> 02:25:14.680]  we take more of your calls. Let's talk to Darren in Florida. Thanks for holding her
[02:25:14.680 --> 02:25:15.680]  on the ear, Darren.
[02:25:15.680 --> 02:25:21.960]  Hey, Alex. First off, you know, I just can't tell you how important enough it is over here.
[02:25:21.960 --> 02:25:28.360]  We don't get your station on radio anywhere. So I go on YouTube to watch the previous stage
[02:25:28.360 --> 02:25:32.800]  broadcast and I can't tell you how important it is to us over here to have that. We would
[02:25:32.800 --> 02:25:37.400]  never have known about the missiles being taken from Dias and right over in South Carolina.
[02:25:37.400 --> 02:25:41.720]  We would never have known the truth about this Bundy thing. If it wasn't for you and
[02:25:41.720 --> 02:25:45.800]  Ava Knight being brave, Kit Daniels doing that great research and timely research. So
[02:25:45.800 --> 02:25:48.880]  you know, I know you get tired hearing it, but it's really important.
[02:25:48.880 --> 02:25:54.280]  No, but I mean, it is a team effort and then it was Drudge. We broke it nationally off
[02:25:54.280 --> 02:26:01.920]  local news. Then Drudge picked it up. So then Fox picked it up. Then MSNBC and CNN picked
[02:26:01.920 --> 02:26:06.360]  it up to attack it. And then it became an international, you know, top story. In fact,
[02:26:06.360 --> 02:26:10.920]  for that weekend, it was the number one story, according to all the sites that track internet
[02:26:10.920 --> 02:26:16.120]  traffic. It was the number one story in the world. And now it's spurring land rights moves
[02:26:16.120 --> 02:26:21.920]  in the West. Now it's spurring a larger discussion about the feds pointing guns at people and
[02:26:21.920 --> 02:26:28.600]  police dogs and snipers. And it's time for the people to push back. We've been groveling
[02:26:28.600 --> 02:26:33.800]  and going along with them and it hasn't worked. I don't want violence, but at the same time,
[02:26:33.800 --> 02:26:38.040]  are we supposed to just, just literally split our throats for the feds? What are we supposed
[02:26:38.040 --> 02:26:39.040]  to do?
[02:26:39.040 --> 02:26:43.800]  Oh, no, absolutely not. No, we, we, the people have a duty to become active, become active
[02:26:43.800 --> 02:26:48.200]  patriots, which I've done. I'm a retired firefighter. I'm always going to type A hands-on guy and
[02:26:48.200 --> 02:26:52.720]  I've done it. And my line in the span was crossed about a couple of years ago from a series
[02:26:52.720 --> 02:26:57.240]  of events, some personal and some collective, but talking about Bundy real quick, you brought
[02:26:57.240 --> 02:27:02.080]  it up today. You mentioned it too, uh, with Mr. Bundy on the line. Yeah, that Wayne Hage
[02:27:02.080 --> 02:27:08.040]  incident happened 10 years ago up in Knight County, Nevada. And yes, he did win. Actually,
[02:27:08.040 --> 02:27:13.080]  the son, the son ended up living through it. Cause the man died, his first wife died.
[02:27:13.080 --> 02:27:19.200]  And then, uh, the rancher Hage married a former congresswoman from Idaho, I believe, and she
[02:27:19.200 --> 02:27:24.200]  mysteriously died in a car accident. All the, all the time that this was going on. And they
[02:27:24.200 --> 02:27:29.040]  by the way, I mean, they stolen half the land in the country or more. It's worth hundreds
[02:27:29.040 --> 02:27:36.200]  of trillions is signed in the executive orders on as collateral. So absolutely. I mean, they're
[02:27:36.200 --> 02:27:40.920]  there to protect what they've stolen. They're like bank robbers sitting on a pile of gold.
[02:27:40.920 --> 02:27:44.800]  And that's why they go after anybody that doesn't let them rape them. And look, the federal
[02:27:44.800 --> 02:27:50.400]  judge found last year in Nevada, the same BLM is in a quote criminal conspiracy to bankrupt
[02:27:50.400 --> 02:27:56.360]  every rancher. It's came out in the documents last Thursday. I had the editor of the new
[02:27:56.360 --> 02:28:01.840]  American on and he was quoting the ruling where they said in the documents, we want
[02:28:01.840 --> 02:28:08.080]  to bankrupt people there with a bunch of paramilitary driving around, beating people up, shaking
[02:28:08.080 --> 02:28:14.760]  people down, bugging their eyes out. It's a foreign army. Period. This is not the law.
[02:28:14.760 --> 02:28:21.040]  This is a group of mercenaries, right? That Hage son has continued to fight and he prevailed.
[02:28:21.040 --> 02:28:25.400]  He won $4 million against the government, which they've yet to pay just like me in Florida.
[02:28:25.400 --> 02:28:30.480]  They took my orange tree down south and we won and they failed to pay me. I got noticed
[02:28:30.480 --> 02:28:33.960]  in the mail years ago that we're going to pay you, never stop any of the same thing
[02:28:33.960 --> 02:28:39.600]  with the son. But Tony D'Amio, he was the sheriff in Nye County and he's got a YouTube
[02:28:39.600 --> 02:28:45.800]  interview. He's a constitutional sheriff. I'm wondering if it's possible if you guys
[02:28:45.800 --> 02:28:50.480]  could contact Sheriff D'Amio, Tony D'Amio or Wayne Hage Jr., right? Well, it might not
[02:28:50.480 --> 02:28:55.800]  be Wayne Hage Jr. Hage, the son, because he did prevail and one of the things to BLM,
[02:28:55.800 --> 02:29:00.960]  they found out in that case that you're talking about where he prevailed, one of the things
[02:29:00.960 --> 02:29:04.440]  that BLM did was they said that his fences were in order and they wrote them up for it
[02:29:04.440 --> 02:29:10.120]  and find them and he researched it. One of the staples was missing and one of the fence
[02:29:10.120 --> 02:29:13.960]  posts, and I did. So I worked for a rancher down in South Florida. I mean, my God, you
[02:29:13.960 --> 02:29:17.320]  got fences. You know, one of your staples is going to pop out.
[02:29:17.320 --> 02:29:24.440]  They've written their own bureaucratic code where it's impossible. They ran 52 families
[02:29:24.440 --> 02:29:31.320]  out. There was one guy left and they couldn't run him out. And ladies and gentlemen, beef
[02:29:31.320 --> 02:29:35.840]  prices is the highest they've ever been. Ranchers are shutting down everywhere. You're going
[02:29:35.840 --> 02:29:42.400]  to pay for the shutdown of America. You're going to pay for the deadbeat Bundy who works
[02:29:42.400 --> 02:29:47.480]  his butt off. But it doesn't matter. The media calls him a deadbeat. He should just go have
[02:29:47.480 --> 02:29:52.440]  anchor babies in Las Vegas. He'd be fine. We're on the march. The m or calls coming

[02:31:04.080 --> 02:31:08.080]  West Virginia counties this year alone over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their
[02:31:08.080 --> 02:31:12.560]  drinking water contaminate. What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking

[02:31:24.960 --> 02:31:29.920]  it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week. Few filters cut out the glyphosate that
[02:31:29.920 --> 02:31:34.980]  is found in water supplies worldwide. Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydro

[02:32:02.600 --> 02:32:07.400]  the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding and making the weaponization
[02:32:07.400 --> 02:32:12.600]  even more vicious and deceptive. All the major networks are state run. We are partnering
[02:32:12.600 --> 02:32:17.400]  this year with the NFL. The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment
[02:32:17.400 --> 02:32:22.320]  and pushes Obamacare. MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state. We have to
[02:32:22.320 --> 02:32:26.720]  break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong
[02:32:26.720 --> 02:32:30.480]  to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities. It is more important
[02:32:30.480 --> 02:32:36.480]  than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media. We are the true media. The establishment

[02:33:26.960 --> 02:33:29.200]  Alex Jones.
[02:33:29.200 --> 02:33:50.240]  All right, folks, I'm asking listeners, what is your line in the sand? I should probably
[02:33:50.240 --> 02:33:54.920]  do a whole show about how have you been gored by the system. But really, all the feds do
[02:33:54.920 --> 02:34:01.160]  is act shocked that you don't like us blowing up Waco. You don't like Ruby Ridge. You don't
[02:34:01.160 --> 02:34:06.560]  like all the checkpoints of the NSA. Oh, we're not spying on you without warrants. Oh, we
[02:34:06.560 --> 02:34:13.120]  got caught. Of course we are. It's no big deal. Of course we secretly torture people.
[02:34:13.120 --> 02:34:17.880]  Of course we'll secretly disappear you. Of course we're setting up highway checkpoints.
[02:34:17.880 --> 02:34:21.360]  Of course we track everything you do. It's for your safety. It's for your safety. It's
[02:34:21.360 --> 02:34:27.560]  for your safety. No, it's not. It's to steal from us to leverage our energy and our time
[02:34:27.560 --> 02:34:41.680]  and our money into this stinking world government whose aim is planetary evil, planetary dehumanization.
[02:34:41.680 --> 02:34:49.960]  And a lot of it is, there's a lot of stupid lazy people in the world, but they're smart
[02:34:49.960 --> 02:34:53.680]  enough to be con artists and they're smart enough to join with other con artists to set
[02:34:53.680 --> 02:34:58.480]  up scams and then protect those scams. And then they get greedy and decide to shut everything
[02:34:58.480 --> 02:35:07.480]  down because they want control of every sector of society. And we're now entering that decadent
[02:35:07.480 --> 02:35:13.120]  cycle. I want to go back to your phone calls and I want to get into the Clintons because
[02:35:13.120 --> 02:35:18.560]  I promise to do that in these new documents that have come out. And it's a 15 minute report
[02:35:18.560 --> 02:35:22.520]  they'll have tonight for the nightly news that Jacari Jackson and other reporters put
[02:35:22.520 --> 02:35:28.920]  together to deal with the Boston bombing and what really happened there. Maybe, you know,
[02:35:28.920 --> 02:35:33.840]  the name of the video should be the true story of the Boston bombing special report or something
[02:35:33.840 --> 02:35:39.720]  I don't know. But the issue is we dominated that last year and showed how it was a false
[02:35:39.720 --> 02:35:46.200]  flag. I want to counter it again this year. So we've got a four minute intro to that report
[02:35:46.200 --> 02:35:50.600]  that will be on the nightly news tonight. We're going to play as well. So we'll do that. Talk
[02:35:50.600 --> 02:35:58.440]  about the Clintons and then go back to your phone calls for Alvin and others that have
[02:35:58.440 --> 02:36:06.920]  been patiently holding before I go any further. Listen, this broadcast is really possible
[02:36:06.920 --> 02:36:12.200]  because of you. That's why when Cliven Bundy was thanking me on air, I was saying, no,
[02:36:12.200 --> 02:36:16.960]  it's the audience and he understood that. We the people, we don't take your money at
[02:36:16.960 --> 02:36:22.200]  gunpoint. We're free association, free will here. If you believe in the information you're
[02:36:22.200 --> 02:36:26.120]  hearing, if it's helped you in life, if all the great guests we've had on and all the
[02:36:26.120 --> 02:36:34.040]  research and all the hardcore, no holds barred, no compromise, savage defense of freedom.
[02:36:34.040 --> 02:36:40.040]  If you like that, if you like funding a bunch of crazies, because you know, in a world of
[02:36:40.040 --> 02:36:44.760]  mad men, you know, being sane is insane. In the land of the blind, the one eyed man is
[02:36:44.760 --> 02:36:51.000]  king in a world of universal deceit, telling the truth is revolutionary act, George Arwell.
[02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:56.640]  If you feel as we feel, if you're on the same page with us, it is an imperative you spread
[02:36:56.640 --> 02:37:00.520]  the word about the broadcast, whether you listen on shortwave internet, satellite, whatever
[02:37:00.520 --> 02:37:07.640]  the AMFM, however you listen, spread the word about the free iPhone app, the free podcast,
[02:37:07.640 --> 02:37:13.040]  support those local stations, support their local sponsors, become a sponsor locally.
[02:37:13.040 --> 02:37:16.600]  It is so important that we reach more people and you've been doing that. That's why we're
[02:37:16.600 --> 02:37:22.280]  having a great effect. And even though as we get bigger, it puts me in more danger.
[02:37:22.280 --> 02:37:30.880]  My entire instinct, my entire spirit wants to go 110% up against the globalist. So please
[02:37:30.880 --> 02:37:36.720]  pray for us as well, but go to info wars life.com, get the nation iodine, get the fluoride shield,
[02:37:36.720 --> 02:37:44.400]  the survival shield, the lung cleanse, the silver bullet, the pro pure systems that are
[02:37:44.400 --> 02:37:48.760]  up there with the G2 filters that are out, blows away the competition. We could sell
[02:37:48.760 --> 02:37:54.280]  the competition we used to. Why? I'd make more money if I sold all the brands. If there
[02:37:54.280 --> 02:37:59.600]  were other brands as good or almost as good, I would sell them. I sell this because in
[02:37:59.600 --> 02:38:03.120]  its class, there's nothing close to it. I sell some other more inexpensive units that
[02:38:03.120 --> 02:38:08.640]  are great as well. Just don't compare. They're in a different class. The pro pure systems,
[02:38:08.640 --> 02:38:18.880]  all of it info wars store.com or you can call toll free 888-253-3139. And by the way, that
[02:38:18.880 --> 02:38:22.840]  25% off on the traveler supposed to be done Saturday. So we need to go ahead and take
[02:38:22.840 --> 02:38:27.320]  that down. I gotta be a man of my word. So I told him last week, get rid of it Friday
[02:38:27.320 --> 02:38:30.960]  night, Saturday morning. It's still up there. So I guess if you got 10 minutes, you can
[02:38:30.960 --> 02:38:36.000]  order those if you want 25% off promo code water, get your 10% off across the board.

[02:38:56.400 --> 02:39:05.120]  than ever info wars store.com or 888-253-3139. And from the bottom of my heart, I want to
[02:39:05.120 --> 02:39:09.200]  thank you for all your support so I can try to pay my folks well and give them bonuses
[02:39:09.200 --> 02:39:15.000]  when they work so hard. And so I can have money to defend myself against spurious attacks
[02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:19.640]  and things that go on behind the scenes. And I don't worship money and status, but let
[02:39:19.640 --> 02:39:23.640]  me tell you, when you go through as much hell as I do, having a little bit of money in the
[02:39:23.640 --> 02:39:28.360]  bank without it, it would seriously be hard to operate with the crap that goes on in my
[02:39:28.360 --> 02:39:33.760]  life. I'm just going to leave it at that. But God has blessed us with a war chest to
[02:39:33.760 --> 02:39:37.160]  be able to do a lot of great things. And I think we've been decent stewards of it. I
[02:39:37.160 --> 02:39:40.640]  pray every day to be a better steward. I pray to have the answers. I pray to know what to
[02:39:40.640 --> 02:39:45.880]  do. I try as hard as I can. I just want to beat these people. And I call it midair refueling.
[02:39:45.880 --> 02:39:51.600]  We need you to energize our coffers so we can get more reporters and fly on more places
[02:39:51.600 --> 02:39:58.800]  and do more and get the personnel we need. So infoorstore.com. We've got great books
[02:39:58.800 --> 02:40:03.720]  on Romans 13, all of it. It's just hundreds of great books, hundreds of great films. It's
[02:40:03.720 --> 02:40:08.400]  all there infoorstore.com. Okay. That's enough of a big plug there. President Blana.TV, all
[02:40:08.400 --> 02:40:13.160]  of that nightly news. Thank you all for your support. We couldn't have done it without
[02:40:13.160 --> 02:40:19.320]  you. Any of it. Thank you for your support. And you've got this commitment. I will attack
[02:40:19.320 --> 02:40:24.240]  the enemy. I will prosecute a war of truth against them. I will never surrender. I will
[02:40:24.240 --> 02:40:29.240]  never back down. And my heart loves God and loves justice. It doesn't mean I'm not, you
[02:40:29.240 --> 02:40:37.480]  know, worldly. It doesn't mean I'm perfect, folks. God knows me. But I am here and I am
[02:40:37.480 --> 02:40:42.080]  committed to do the best job I can. And I appreciate your prayers. I can feel them. Thank
[02:40:42.080 --> 02:40:45.920]  you so much. I love all of you out there. We couldn't have done this without you and
[02:40:45.920 --> 02:40:49.520]  our AM and FM affiliates out there. So many great people. And the fact that we've hit
[02:40:49.520 --> 02:40:54.840]  the barbed wire so more people can follow and the fact that we've mainline Liberty message,
[02:40:54.840 --> 02:41:01.720]  we've broken the Clinton blockade, the globalist blockade. That's coming up after this special
[02:41:01.720 --> 02:41:09.720]  report. That's the intro to the 15, 16 minute piece that's going to air tonight on info
[02:41:09.720 --> 02:41:16.120]  wars nightly news seven o'clock central. Here is part of that report. But again, the explosion,
[02:41:16.120 --> 02:41:22.760]  the main one there at the marathon sports. And then you can hear after that Paula, it's
[02:41:22.760 --> 02:41:26.400]  just absolutely heartbreaking to see this. It's been a year since the bomb attack at
[02:41:26.400 --> 02:41:31.280]  the Boston marathon. Info wars was pointing out the inconsistencies in the story from
[02:41:31.280 --> 02:41:35.000]  the very beginning. Was there any part in the oligarchal because according to Boston
[02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:38.800]  Globe dot com, they said they were doing drills this morning for the same exact thing that
[02:41:38.800 --> 02:41:42.320]  happened according to Boston Globe dot com. Now was used guys given any warning ahead
[02:41:42.320 --> 02:41:47.400]  of time of this taking place? As I said earlier, there was no specific intelligence. Oh, sir,
[02:41:47.400 --> 02:41:51.680]  why were allowed speakers telling people in the audience become moments before the bomb
[02:41:51.680 --> 02:41:55.320]  went off? Is this another false flag stage attack to take out some of the liberties and
[02:41:55.320 --> 02:41:59.560]  put more Homeland Security on sticking the hands down on the pants on the streets? No.
[02:41:59.560 --> 02:42:06.320]  And it wasn't just the Boston Globe who reported the drills. There was dogs with their hand
[02:42:06.320 --> 02:42:14.760]  list going around sniffing for explosives. And we were told on a loud announcement that
[02:42:14.760 --> 02:42:21.800]  we shouldn't be concerned if it was just a drill. So maybe it was just a drill. But
[02:42:21.800 --> 02:42:27.800]  I've just never seen a drill like that. The most show of force that a track coach has
[02:42:27.800 --> 02:42:33.200]  seen in a lifetime of marathons. This brings up questions of prior knowledge. And on the
[02:42:33.200 --> 02:42:39.720]  subject of prior knowledge, we found out that the CIA, FBI and DHS knew of Tamalem Zarnaev
[02:42:39.720 --> 02:42:44.920]  before the bombing. Reports show that the oldest Arnaev had previously attended a workshop
[02:42:44.920 --> 02:42:50.360]  sponsored by the CIA. The word is also out that the FBI and Department of Homeland Security
[02:42:50.360 --> 02:42:55.360]  had been tipped to Tamalem's visit to a radical mosque in Dagestan, a neighbor of Chetsnia.
[02:42:55.360 --> 02:43:00.280]  The FBI felt that this was of little consequence and didn't consider him a threat. Also the
[02:43:00.280 --> 02:43:06.000]  suspect's uncle Ruslan, who quickly distanced himself from his nephews, worked for you said.
[02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:10.800]  As the article points out, the U.S. Agency for International Development is an agency
[02:43:10.800 --> 02:43:16.960]  used by the U.S. government to operate humanitarian NGOs, instrumental in running color revolutions
[02:43:16.960 --> 02:43:22.440]  in former Soviet states. And he just so happened to be the relative of choice for state-run
[02:43:22.440 --> 02:43:25.880]  media. I understand that there must be several criminals
[02:43:25.880 --> 02:43:30.920]  and other people on U.S. data banks, especially with the DHS putting toddlers on the no fly
[02:43:30.920 --> 02:43:37.000]  list. But if you have a suspect who the Russian government warned you about, attended CIA
[02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:43.080]  back to workshops that the DHS was briefed on and the FBI interviewed, why does the FBI
[02:43:43.080 --> 02:43:48.200]  need public assistance identifying the suspect? Not to mention how the Finch reportedly called
[02:43:48.200 --> 02:43:53.160]  the Zarnaev brothers after the bombing and before any other incidents.
[02:43:53.160 --> 02:43:58.280]  Everybody out there knows these individuals as friends, neighbors, co-workers, or family
[02:43:58.280 --> 02:44:02.680]  members of the suspects. Though it may be difficult, the nation is counting on those
[02:44:02.680 --> 02:44:06.440]  with information to come forward and provide it to us.
[02:44:06.440 --> 02:44:11.640]  Did you ask any of your co-workers, their agents? Aside from Stonewall and InfoWars
[02:44:11.640 --> 02:44:16.800]  reported Dan Badandi, Goon's gotten his face for dare asking real questions.
[02:44:16.800 --> 02:44:23.200]  Are both suspects seen planting these devices after the finish line of the war in America?
[02:44:23.200 --> 02:44:28.080]  No. The only one who was observed planting what we believe to be the device is suspect
[02:44:28.080 --> 02:44:31.200]  number two with a white cap. Let's talk about those photos.
[02:44:31.200 --> 02:44:35.200]  There's bombs drills Monday morning. We got photographs. I'm InfoWars.com folks.
[02:44:35.200 --> 02:44:40.000]  Next question, please. Jahar's white or gray backpack with the black
[02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:45.120]  stripes is clearly not the black backpack with the white or gray stripes that exploded.
[02:44:45.120 --> 02:44:49.440]  In fact, the bags are the exact opposite. The only official photos that should be officially
[02:44:49.440 --> 02:44:53.040]  relied upon in this investigation are those you see before you today.
[02:44:53.040 --> 02:44:56.400]  So what's the possible explanation for these bizarro backpacks?
[02:44:56.400 --> 02:44:59.040]  And you're carrying a backpack. We have one here. This is a light color.
[02:44:59.040 --> 02:45:02.080]  This is a light color. A light number two hat. Yeah.
[02:45:02.080 --> 02:45:08.160]  And then it's easy enough for you to go ahead and take out the actual device that being
[02:45:08.160 --> 02:45:11.040]  put, how's the weapon? There's one theory.
[02:45:11.040 --> 02:45:15.520]  Doubt of the official story could easily been squashed by releasing footage of the bomb being
[02:45:15.520 --> 02:45:19.200]  placed. Footage that even Governor Deval Patrick hasn't seen.
[02:45:19.200 --> 02:45:23.360]  Well, the video tape is not something I've seen. It's been described to me,
[02:45:24.240 --> 02:45:36.080]  but it does seem to be pretty clear that this suspect took the backpack off, put it down.
[02:45:36.080 --> 02:45:45.440]  All right, folks, that's part one. And there's two other big parts. But the reason
[02:45:47.520 --> 02:45:52.320]  the Russians quote, warn the FBI, the Russians actually said, is this guy your agent?
[02:45:52.320 --> 02:45:57.440]  He's got a fake passport, a fake name. Why are you letting him come in and out of your country?
[02:45:58.720 --> 02:46:03.760]  Is he an Al-Qaeda operative for you? That's how you blow someone's cover instead of just killing
[02:46:03.760 --> 02:46:11.680]  them. The Russians have had a very hands-off stance towards these double and triple agents.
[02:46:12.400 --> 02:46:16.080]  And again, I'm not romanticizing with Russians in the old days, though the KGB would just kill
[02:46:16.080 --> 02:46:22.720]  somebody like that. Instead, I believe they were part of the drill. That's why they, you know,
[02:46:22.720 --> 02:46:26.400]  the day it happened, they were out partying, didn't care. Then heard on the news, they were the guys
[02:46:26.400 --> 02:46:30.240]  that did it, reportedly sort of calling the FBI saying, what are you doing? I mean, this all came
[02:46:30.240 --> 02:46:34.960]  out, but really wasn't headline news. So they're calling the government, others going, we didn't
[02:46:34.960 --> 02:46:41.200]  do this. What in the world are you talking about? That's why I want to tell folks, don't go be part
[02:46:41.200 --> 02:46:46.560]  of drills. If you're a police officer or even in the FBI, because let me tell you something,
[02:46:46.560 --> 02:46:51.840]  the next wave, they're going to try to now say the cops can't be trusted so they can purge police.
[02:46:51.840 --> 02:46:56.000]  And if you're a libertarian or a conservative cop or a constitutionalist cop or something,
[02:46:56.000 --> 02:47:00.800]  and they try to get you to be part of drills like this, you're crazy. They'll go, look at
[02:47:00.800 --> 02:47:06.800]  Sergeant Ben Johnson, hypothetical name John Doe, why he visited this website and he was part of a
[02:47:06.800 --> 02:47:12.560]  shooting club and he was a libertarian tea partier and he blew up the daycare center. I mean, you
[02:47:12.560 --> 02:47:21.200]  can script this stuff up one side and down the other. There was a drill. It turns out they're
[02:47:21.200 --> 02:47:25.200]  connecting to the government. The FBI lies and says, we've never heard of them been quote,
[02:47:25.200 --> 02:47:28.880]  tracking them for three years. I looked at these brothers. I've talked to their family
[02:47:29.600 --> 02:47:35.520]  who's been willing to come on hangs the phone up, calls back crying 30 minutes later saying,
[02:47:35.520 --> 02:47:39.920]  I was just threatened. I love my daughter. No, no, no, they told me they can do whatever
[02:47:39.920 --> 02:47:46.800]  they want. No, no, no. I mean, I live in a movie folks. No, no, they will get my daughter.
[02:47:46.800 --> 02:47:56.640]  I mean, it's not funny folks and see no one would believe that or know that unless you had
[02:47:56.640 --> 02:48:02.960]  enjoyed and I say that sarcastically what I've enjoyed and the government trying to ruin my
[02:48:02.960 --> 02:48:08.880]  family and trying to threaten people in my family until they have nothing to do with me.
[02:48:08.880 --> 02:48:19.760]  I mean, that's the type of nasty crud that goes on. I mean, I've gone through stuff Jim Garrison
[02:48:19.760 --> 02:48:24.800]  didn't go through and I don't make a big deal out of it. The point is, I know who runs this
[02:48:24.800 --> 02:48:29.280]  government. They've got people that listen to your phone and then wait till the day something
[02:48:29.280 --> 02:48:33.520]  bad happens in the middle of some family disasters when they call and they call it and say,
[02:48:33.520 --> 02:48:39.120]  oh, so your mom or dad's in the hospital. I'm gonna hope they die. And by the way,
[02:48:39.120 --> 02:48:41.600]  I saw a little dog in your back porch. I'm going to cut its head off.
[02:48:46.160 --> 02:48:50.000]  This is who runs America. And you know what, getting scared and going, well, I better not
[02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:54.320]  say anything. They'll get me. That's how they win. That's how these thugs win. They're illegitimate.
[02:48:54.320 --> 02:48:57.920]  They're a fraud. They're a joke. They're a scam. They're dishonorable.
[02:48:57.920 --> 02:49:04.560]  Bongino, the former top secret service agent on the foreign operations of Obama,
[02:49:05.200 --> 02:49:08.720]  his family's been threatened, his office is broken into his cars are broken into.
[02:49:08.720 --> 02:49:13.040]  He's being threatened. He's being harassed. And he's not even giving out any of the secrets of Obama.
[02:49:15.920 --> 02:49:17.360]  They just want him to be scared.
[02:49:22.640 --> 02:49:27.120]  We're going to get Bongino back on the show. I mean, are we just a total nation of cowards?
[02:49:27.120 --> 02:49:30.560]  You know, I was reading over these government documents that got released by the Clinton
[02:49:32.080 --> 02:49:38.080]  group and they're so incredible that I don't know if I can give justice to them,
[02:49:38.080 --> 02:49:39.920]  but we're going to go to break and come back and cover them.
[02:49:41.200 --> 02:49:45.440]  And I guess do some overdrive since I'm here saying I'll go to your phone calls
[02:49:45.440 --> 02:49:48.480]  because I want to get to everybody like Alvin that's been holding so long.
[02:49:50.480 --> 02:49:55.840]  But you read this, it's everything we already knew, but just confirms three years before Matt
[02:49:55.840 --> 02:50:00.800]  Drudge changed the world is how Breitbart says it and how news will be consumed.
[02:50:00.800 --> 02:50:04.480]  President Bill Clinton's White House feared the internet was allowing average citizens,
[02:50:04.480 --> 02:50:08.560]  especially conservatives to bypass legacy gatekeepers and access information that
[02:50:08.560 --> 02:50:12.880]  previously been denied to them by the mainstream press. I want all my writers to write stories
[02:50:12.880 --> 02:50:16.000]  on this in the next week. I hardly ever tell them what to write about. They just write
[02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:19.440]  about whatever they think is interesting, but this is a directive guys. Let's write about this because
[02:50:19.440 --> 02:50:26.800]  this ties into media matters. This ties into everything, world net daily and Breitbart have
[02:50:26.800 --> 02:50:37.040]  the best breakdown on it. But they say in here that this allows them to put stories out that then
[02:50:37.040 --> 02:50:42.720]  get into local media that then get into the Washington Post, New York Times. And it goes
[02:50:42.720 --> 02:50:46.400]  into saying then they have congressional committees that start investigating their
[02:50:46.400 --> 02:50:51.680]  criminal activity. That's it. They want air superiority where no one can question them,
[02:50:51.680 --> 02:50:55.440]  where they can, you know, kill whoever they want in Arkansas, cut their arms and legs off,
[02:50:55.440 --> 02:51:21.440]  shoot them nine times in the back of the head and have the local paper announce it was a suicide.

[02:54:22.320 --> 02:54:28.720]  WorldNet Daily has great coverage of it and the whole memo.
[02:54:31.040 --> 02:54:33.840]  The 28 pages that are heavily sanitized but are bad enough.
[02:54:36.160 --> 02:54:43.680]  And then, Reitbart's also got it. ClintonLibrary.gov. And this is what they decided to release.
[02:54:44.400 --> 02:54:51.040]  I mean, it's got incredibly authoritarian quotes in here. Moreover, the internet allows an
[02:54:51.040 --> 02:54:55.280]  extraordinary amount of unregulated data and information to be located in one area
[02:54:55.280 --> 02:55:01.360]  and available to all the memo states. And it instructs what they call mainstream media
[02:55:02.560 --> 02:55:09.680]  with a list of people not to use and to call all alternative media conspiracy theories.
[02:55:11.040 --> 02:55:16.720]  And you wonder why? I mean, I wonder why the Austin American
[02:55:16.720 --> 02:55:22.160]  statesman would call me when I caught bribery on tape and the legislature censured the
[02:55:22.880 --> 02:55:28.160]  legislator and admitted it was bribery. And the paper calls up and goes,
[02:55:28.160 --> 02:55:32.000]  why are you having conspiracy theories about this payment of money? And I said,
[02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:37.440]  it's admitted that it was illegal and wrong. And I caught it on video. No, it's a conspiracy theory.
[02:55:38.560 --> 02:55:42.960]  And when Nightline comes here, I go, no, these world leaders are calling for global government.
[02:55:42.960 --> 02:55:46.240]  And the State Department has its global governance division. Here, let me show you.
[02:55:46.240 --> 02:55:50.320]  Oh, that's a different world government they're talking about than you. You're a conspiracy
[02:55:50.320 --> 02:55:57.280]  theorist. Oh, here I have eco science about depopulating the world and promoting homosexuality
[02:55:57.280 --> 02:56:04.000]  to reduce population. No, that's a conspiracy theory as well. And why are you anti gay? I'm
[02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:08.560]  not anti anybody. They say they do this for depopulation.
[02:56:08.560 --> 02:56:18.560]  They say they're putting cancer viruses in the vaccines. They say, but see, it's this reality
[02:56:18.560 --> 02:56:23.840]  management. And then I was reading the 28 pages of the 331 page memo. Boy, I love to see that
[02:56:24.720 --> 02:56:28.880]  that the Clinton library is put out. And it's all about how they were going to shut down the
[02:56:28.880 --> 02:56:33.840]  new media and how they were going to control it. I mean, this is so authoritarian. And here's the
[02:56:33.840 --> 02:56:41.840]  deal. They've released this themselves. They just don't care. But what did Hillary say a year ago?
[02:56:43.280 --> 02:56:47.680]  She said they're losing the information war. And they aren't because we have the moral high ground,
[02:56:47.680 --> 02:56:53.760]  folks. The military is training to take on the American people. That is treason. The military
[02:56:53.760 --> 02:56:59.200]  doesn't want to be part of it. If we give them moral support, they won't be part of it. Even when
[02:56:59.200 --> 02:57:04.880]  the Clintons pull Oklahoma City part two. And look, I'm willing to risk my life to just put it on the
[02:57:04.880 --> 02:57:11.200]  table here. And the good news is I was the first person to talk about false flag terror on a large
[02:57:11.200 --> 02:57:18.320]  platform. I was the first person to cover all these issues and then to make it safe for the
[02:57:18.320 --> 02:57:23.520]  other alternative media to do it. But it doesn't matter because what came first chicken or the egg,
[02:57:23.520 --> 02:57:27.440]  I don't even want to credit. I'm giving you a testament to how our information has become main
[02:57:27.440 --> 02:57:32.480]  line. And now we're going to continue to gain traction. We are the real media. The Western
[02:57:32.480 --> 02:57:44.480]  Journalism Center, Joseph Farah is listed in here and others that then basically
[02:57:46.720 --> 02:57:52.720]  helped set the stage for things like drugs to come along. This happened three years before
[02:57:52.720 --> 02:57:59.840]  Drudge hit the scene. And again, that just shows how important people like Joseph Farah are.
[02:58:02.400 --> 02:58:08.560]  I want to get Joseph Farah on about this. I mean, imagine the Clintons 24 seven were fearing him
[02:58:10.160 --> 02:58:14.240]  because he'd come out of the biggest newspapers in the country as a major editor and was going
[02:58:14.240 --> 02:58:20.320]  out to create the first independent journalism until 88 folks. There wasn't talk radio. It wasn't
[02:58:20.320 --> 02:58:24.640]  allowed in the so-called free country until the lawyer we've had on Bruce Fine got it changed
[02:58:25.360 --> 02:58:31.920]  at the FCC. He was the deputy head of it. See how you can change the world? We exist because of
[02:58:31.920 --> 02:58:37.920]  Bruce Fine. Drudge exists because of people like Farah. And now Drudge helps everybody else. We're
[02:58:37.920 --> 02:58:44.240]  all on the same team for an open free press. We are the liberals. They are the authoritarians.
[02:58:44.240 --> 02:58:54.400]  We'll be right back. Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide.
[02:58:54.400 --> 02:58:59.440]  I'll also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the
[02:58:59.440 --> 02:59:04.000]  planet for more than a decade. My favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[02:59:04.000 --> 02:59:08.800]  Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade grown Arabica beans. We have now
[02:59:08.800 --> 02:59:15.040]  managed to secure the sought after beans in a highly customized blend. Discover and try a bag
[02:59:15.040 --> 02:59:21.760]  of the patriot blend 100% organic coffee at infowarslife.com. This coffee gives you a long
[02:59:21.760 --> 02:59:26.400]  smooth pick me up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give
[02:59:26.400 --> 02:59:31.600]  me personally. Hands down this is my favorite coffee and it's taken us years to secure connections
[02:59:31.600 --> 02:59:37.120]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers dropped by the site today order a bag or two and I don't
[02:59:37.120 --> 02:59:41.520]  think you're going to be disappointed available in original or with our immune support infusion
[02:59:41.520 --> 02:59:47.280]  blend you will be supporting a free press all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my
[02:59:47.280 --> 02:59:56.240]  favorite coffee available at infowarslife.com. Coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening

[03:00:59.440 --> 03:01:05.760]  holding so long from arizona i really appreciate that that's all right but my line is in the sand
[03:01:06.640 --> 03:01:12.240]  and my forefathers are already made in the constitution and the bill of rights and they've
[03:01:12.240 --> 03:01:23.200]  already crossed it when they made unconstitutional laws i agree so what do we do i i say we take
[03:01:23.200 --> 03:01:28.160]  them out of government like whether or not we have to use arms or not we stand up
[03:01:30.560 --> 03:01:35.760]  go to your elective officials and stand up and take them out they do what we say or you're out
[03:01:35.760 --> 03:01:43.600]  well look at the boston marathon the governor says he doesn't want the race through a militarized zone
[03:01:43.600 --> 03:01:47.840]  they call it the safest city in america when the whole thing's a staged event
[03:01:47.840 --> 03:01:51.520]  of course the average cop doesn't even know that it's so sick i appreciate your call

[03:01:57.440 --> 03:02:04.640]  uh what's what really uh gets my goat is uh you know how does dare does how does here we dare uh
[03:02:04.640 --> 03:02:10.720]  call bundy a terrorist when uh he had the bill out the bill and i'm sure but his ranch pointing
[03:02:10.720 --> 03:02:16.400]  guns at people and not the other way around also the only other people that i know that
[03:02:16.400 --> 03:02:22.880]  sure but your house to collect debts with guns is the mafia well that's right i mean they show
[03:02:22.880 --> 03:02:28.880]  up they're tasering people beating them up pointing guns at people this is america while
[03:02:28.880 --> 03:02:34.720]  the government's robbing us and harry reed's got all these deals with his kids and everybody said
[03:02:34.720 --> 03:02:38.640]  this stuff's illegal what harry reed does he gets away with it because he's so powerful
[03:02:41.120 --> 03:02:48.160]  i agree where do you think it's all going i think it's going uh where you know the people
[03:02:48.160 --> 03:02:54.800]  uh i've had enough you know i really do you know the trading of the constitution is uh was my line
[03:02:54.800 --> 03:03:00.880]  in the sand you know i'm picking on the little guy you know it's enough well i agree and then when
[03:03:00.880 --> 03:03:05.520]  we don't want to be picked on anymore and we start standing up start acting like americans they tell
[03:03:05.520 --> 03:03:14.000]  us we're terrorists he called them violent domestic terrorists in a new video it's incredible
[03:03:14.000 --> 03:03:20.960]  well i mean i think giving missiles to al qaeda that obama is now promoting he's owning it he is
[03:03:20.960 --> 03:03:26.880]  terrorism i appreciate you calling in let's go to matt in arizona you're on the air go ahead
[03:03:28.560 --> 03:03:35.520]  i got an aid but the line in the sand is when the people are afraid of the government when they're
[03:03:36.560 --> 03:03:41.280]  when the government is afraid of the people there's liberty when the people are afraid of the
[03:03:41.280 --> 03:03:47.200]  government it's tyranny and i pay about 50 of my wages my income and taxes last year between
[03:03:47.760 --> 03:03:54.400]  social security medicare unemployment federal and state income tax and when my brother went to
[03:03:54.400 --> 03:03:58.240]  iraq and i'm i was the marine corps and when he went to iraq and i knew that was an unjust war
[03:03:58.960 --> 03:04:03.840]  and they took him away from me that's my line in the sand that's when i said it's time to get
[03:04:03.840 --> 03:04:08.720]  involved and it's time to take our country back because they're putting people in dangerous positions
[03:04:08.720 --> 03:04:13.760]  for money for oil whatever you want to call it what would you do if 300 armed men showed up
[03:04:13.760 --> 03:04:18.000]  and started tasering people and said you can't hold a sign on the side of a state highway in
[03:04:18.000 --> 03:04:21.920]  the middle of the desert or we're going to beat you up i mean would you like tenement square just
