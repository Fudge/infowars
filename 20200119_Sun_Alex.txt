[00:00.000 --> 00:25.680]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:25.680 --> 00:30.400]  We have cracked the code. We understand the globalist false flag operation plan for next
[00:30.400 --> 00:37.040]  week. We all wonder why did Pelosi rush impeachment and then hold it back for almost a month?
[00:37.040 --> 00:42.040]  They were lining it up for Martin Luther King Day because a yearly gun march has happened
[00:42.040 --> 00:47.720]  for 20 years in Virginia at the Capitol. They're planning to stage mass shootings, bombings
[00:47.720 --> 00:53.760]  or false flags to try to turn the American people against gun owners and President Trump.
[00:53.760 --> 01:01.480]  The pre-programming is a thousand percent clear. It is absolutely imperative that everyone
[01:01.480 --> 01:06.760]  understands that the globalists are losing their fight against America. The awakening
[01:06.760 --> 01:12.360]  is huge and they are betting everything on claiming Trump supporters are white supremacists
[01:12.360 --> 01:16.920]  who are pro-gun and who are going to come kill law enforcement. Almost all the police
[01:16.920 --> 01:21.840]  are pro-gun. Almost all the military are pro-gun. We've won the political fight. So bring your
[01:21.840 --> 01:26.080]  guns. I'm totally for the Second Amendment. I've done open carry marches all over the
[01:26.080 --> 01:33.120]  United States, but know this. Who we really need is people with cameras watching the leftist
[01:33.120 --> 01:37.720]  antifa and that weirdo that they've gotten drugged up at some hotel, like the Southern
[01:37.720 --> 01:41.560]  Poverty Law Center has done before with McVey and others, who they're going to use as their
[01:41.560 --> 01:46.360]  patsy because this is when the deep state's going to make their move. The planets have
[01:46.360 --> 01:52.400]  aligned. The trial starts the day after this in Virginia and on every channel they say
[01:52.400 --> 01:56.800]  the right-wing terror attacks are coming. The cops are all going to get killed because
[01:56.800 --> 02:02.080]  they always pre-program before they stage something. So this is a maximum alert. They
[02:02.080 --> 02:05.400]  don't have control of the government fully now. The people are awake. I believe they'll
[02:05.400 --> 02:09.520]  fail, especially if they know you're watching. And if they do stage a big attack, they're
[02:09.520 --> 02:13.080]  going to try to censor right up front and block the truth getting out. So everyone
[02:13.080 --> 02:19.240]  needs to be there, filming live, getting it out, documenting it, human intelligence,
[02:19.240 --> 02:23.680]  human action, America, and the sleeping giant will defeat this globalist chai-kong-funded
[02:23.680 --> 02:28.000]  deep state operation to stop our president being re-elected. America is fighting for
[02:28.000 --> 02:32.000]  its life. History is happening now. I'm about to lay it out when we come back. Stay with
[02:32.000 --> 02:47.960]  us. The deep state knows they're losing right now. And they are preparing to launch false
[02:47.960 --> 02:54.320]  flag terror attacks inside America while the trial of President Trump only the third time
[02:54.320 --> 02:59.120]  in U.S. history takes place starting next Tuesday. The planets have aligned. Martin
[02:59.120 --> 03:04.320]  Luther King Day tuned into any news channel. Right-wing racists or pro-God are going to
[03:04.320 --> 03:08.720]  kill cops. They're going to kill black people. It's on. It's about to happen. Obviously gun
[03:08.720 --> 03:14.160]  owners and patriots are the very group that doesn't engage in criminal activity and racist
[03:14.160 --> 03:18.440]  garbage like that. And we do cry at all. We're going to be there in Virginia starting tomorrow
[03:18.440 --> 03:22.800]  covering it. And we're going to be here next week covering the fake Trump trial. But ladies
[03:22.800 --> 03:27.760]  and gentlemen, they're going to make their moves. I've been saying for months, during
[03:27.760 --> 03:31.920]  the Trump trial in the Senate, I told you four months ago they would begin the impeachment.
[03:31.920 --> 03:36.040]  I told you they'd pass it in the house. I told you it would have no evidence that people
[03:36.040 --> 03:40.640]  would understand why it was so flimsy because they don't want Trump to take it serious. My
[03:40.640 --> 03:47.160]  gut is always right. They want them to take it as a joke and be ready for one defense.
[03:47.160 --> 03:51.760]  Abusive power by the president blocking Congress, obstruction of Congress. But what they're
[03:51.760 --> 03:57.760]  really going to be doing is using the trial as a way to have him under judgment while
[03:57.760 --> 04:01.360]  they cause race riots, while they blow up federal buildings, while they shoot a bunch
[04:01.360 --> 04:07.680]  of cops. And I've been saying that for months. Now it's getting even more insane, ladies
[04:07.680 --> 04:12.520]  and gentlemen. Every channel, I spent hours tonight watching CNN, Fox News, MSNBC. It's
[04:12.520 --> 04:17.120]  like right wingers are going to kill cops. There's white supremacists everywhere. Oh
[04:17.120 --> 04:21.200]  my God. This is the big challenge. This is Trump's people in Virginia. They're about
[04:21.200 --> 04:26.080]  to attack the Capitol. Governor Northam's a hero declaring an emergency. This is their
[04:26.080 --> 04:30.840]  backdrop. Just like two years ago in Charlottesville, the Soros funded to try to create that class
[04:30.840 --> 04:35.960]  to say that one poor woman dying was Trump's fault. They've got something big planned.
[04:35.960 --> 04:40.560]  They wouldn't make this move and screw the pooch with the attack, with what happened
[04:40.560 --> 04:44.640]  with Pelosi, with none of it making sense unless they've got something big. And listen,
[04:44.640 --> 04:48.120]  they're getting their ass kicked. I'm not saying they're all powerful. I'm saying they're
[04:48.120 --> 04:53.840]  going to launch everything they've got in the next three or four days and people need
[04:53.840 --> 04:59.360]  to be aware of it. They need to understand. They need to know it. It is I, the leader
[04:59.360 --> 05:06.280]  of Cobra here for a message to President Trump, the American people, and Alex Jones of Info
[05:06.280 --> 05:10.280]  Awards. Our operations with our partners, the Communist
[05:10.280 --> 05:17.520]  Chinese, have bought control of your media. But it's true. Your people are beginning to
[05:17.520 --> 05:26.040]  awaken. That's why Cobra is launching operations to trigger race war, mass shootings and bombings,
[05:26.040 --> 05:33.160]  which will be blamed on those loyal to America. Anyone once we stage these attacks that does
[05:33.160 --> 05:41.840]  not blame it on Trump will also be targeted by Cobra in the future. You see, when you
[05:41.840 --> 05:49.320]  expose our false flags and fake media, I will carry out a tax and then plan you like we've
[05:49.320 --> 06:17.080]  done with Alex Jones. Blaming him for mass shootings. We committed. Hey, oh, come on.
[06:17.080 --> 06:27.360]  Go ahead.
[06:57.360 --> 07:07.360]  I'm going in.
[07:07.360 --> 07:08.360]  Alex Jones.
[07:08.360 --> 07:09.360]  Alex Jones in fours.com.
[07:09.360 --> 07:10.360]  Yeah, what about going?
[07:10.360 --> 07:11.360]  I'm going in.
[07:11.360 --> 07:12.360]  This is it.
[07:12.360 --> 07:13.360]  That's true.
[07:13.360 --> 07:14.360]  I'm going in.
[07:14.360 --> 07:15.360]  I'm going in.
[07:15.360 --> 07:16.360]  Let's go.
[07:16.360 --> 07:17.360]  You go man.
[07:17.360 --> 07:18.360]  You go.
[07:18.360 --> 07:19.360]  Let's go up on the tail end of this.
[07:19.360 --> 07:20.360]  Come on.
[07:20.360 --> 07:21.360]  Go.
[07:21.360 --> 07:22.360]  I love you.
[07:22.360 --> 07:23.360]  I love you.
[07:23.360 --> 07:24.360]  I love you.
[07:24.360 --> 07:25.360]  I love you.
[07:25.360 --> 07:26.360]  I love you.
[07:26.360 --> 07:27.360]  I love.
[07:27.360 --> 07:33.360]  I love you.
[07:33.360 --> 07:49.360]  I love.
[08:19.360 --> 08:23.760]  George Soros thanks Donald Trump for allowing him to election medal.
[08:23.760 --> 08:25.600]  He says, thank you.
[08:25.600 --> 08:30.480]  I've decided to join George Soros because President Trump
[08:30.480 --> 08:32.680]  will protect my free speech.
[08:32.680 --> 08:37.920]  I have put George Soros's condom on my head.
[08:37.920 --> 08:39.200]  I love George Soros.
[08:42.400 --> 08:45.040]  I hate Trump.
[08:45.040 --> 08:47.000]  I've joined you.
[08:47.000 --> 08:49.120]  I do not want to make America great.
[08:49.120 --> 08:52.560]  I agree with the governor of New York.
[08:52.560 --> 08:56.080]  America was never great, and it will never be great.
[08:56.080 --> 08:57.960]  Yay!
[08:57.960 --> 09:01.680]  Up with Soros, down with Trump.
[09:01.680 --> 09:05.240]  Up with Soros, down with Trump.
[09:05.240 --> 09:08.800]  Up with Soros, down with Trump.
[09:08.800 --> 09:12.320]  Up with Soros, down with Trump.
[09:12.320 --> 09:14.040]  Down with Trump.
[09:14.040 --> 09:17.520]  Up with Soros, up with Soros.
[09:17.520 --> 09:20.280]  Up with Soros.
[09:20.280 --> 09:23.400]  We love abortion.
[09:23.400 --> 09:25.920]  We love communism.
[09:25.920 --> 09:27.800]  Yeah!
[09:27.800 --> 09:30.800]  Kill those babies like Michelle Wolf said.
[09:30.800 --> 09:32.360]  Mothers kill their babies.
[09:32.360 --> 09:34.440]  Yeah!
[09:34.440 --> 09:36.600]  I love Satan.
[09:36.600 --> 09:37.560]  And I love Hillary.
[09:37.560 --> 09:40.240]  I love Jeffrey Epstein.
[09:40.240 --> 09:42.880]  Oh, I love Namba.
[09:42.880 --> 09:45.960]  And I love George Soros.
[09:45.960 --> 09:47.840]  I love Soros.
[09:47.840 --> 09:49.820]  I love Soros.
[09:49.820 --> 09:55.360]  I love Soros, along with Trump.
[09:55.360 --> 09:59.000]  Up with Soros, down with Trump.
[09:59.000 --> 10:01.960]  Up with Soros, down with Trump.
[10:01.960 --> 10:05.680]  Up, up, up with Soros.
[10:05.680 --> 10:09.180]  Up, up with Soros.
[10:09.180 --> 10:14.520]  Up, up with Soros.
[10:44.520 --> 11:03.800]  I just support killing all the ladies and I support George Soros, and I hate Trump, and
[11:03.800 --> 11:09.680]  I want Trump to move around a bit, and I hate America, and I agree with George Soros, and
[11:09.680 --> 11:16.480]  I agree, I agree, we should absolutely take all America free speech and they're not liberals.
[11:16.480 --> 11:22.000]  Don't act so surprised, globalist. You didn't think you could silence the American people.
[11:22.000 --> 11:28.280]  All right, that was Alex Jones yesterday at the Women's March in Washington, D.C., and
[11:28.280 --> 11:32.160]  of course Washington, D.C. and Richmond are only about a hundred miles apart. He will
[11:32.160 --> 11:40.400]  be at the rally in support of the Second Amendment. It's now been characterized by the media as
[11:40.400 --> 11:47.640]  a show of force. We have comments from Washington Post and other people trying to link the people
[11:47.640 --> 11:50.840]  who are showing up to redress their grievances with the Democrat majority. You know, this
[11:50.840 --> 11:59.040]  is the first time they've had a Democrat majority since 1994, 95 in Virginia, and folks, this
[11:59.040 --> 12:06.800]  is not the Democrat party of 25 years ago. They have become radical authoritarians, and
[12:06.800 --> 12:11.400]  so we're going to be talking to Alex later in the program. He's there in the area. He'll
[12:11.400 --> 12:15.480]  be giving us an update. Of course, we do have an update at Infowars.com, scenes from the
[12:15.480 --> 12:22.280]  Virginia Capitol. We have militarized police arriving in Richmond. As I point out, take
[12:22.280 --> 12:32.040]  a look at this picture of this armored vehicle. It looks like it's a bulldozer with a armored
[12:32.040 --> 12:38.920]  outhouse in front of it, but they call it a Rook, a Rook armored SWAT carrier. So I guess
[12:38.920 --> 12:44.880]  it's a Rook to take out all the pawns, or maybe it's a Rook to assault your castle with,
[12:44.880 --> 12:50.800]  you know, because that is your home, your castle. They are assaulting your very rights,
[12:50.800 --> 12:55.140]  and it's not just the guns. I mean, that is very important what they're doing, but we
[12:55.140 --> 13:01.760]  have to understand the Democrats have a very wide agenda that's not being talked about.
[13:01.760 --> 13:10.480]  We've got two bills that have been introduced to inject mandatory vaccines into education
[13:10.480 --> 13:16.680]  and into everything else in people's lives. We have bills that have been put up to change
[13:16.680 --> 13:20.640]  the way the electoral college works there in Virginia to allow the governor of Virginia
[13:20.640 --> 13:28.080]  to serve two terms instead of one. Virginia is the only state, I believe, that allows
[13:28.080 --> 13:34.280]  the governor to only serve one term. I think that's a good idea. And they want Ralph Northam,
[13:34.280 --> 13:40.640]  Governor Coonman, the guy who dressed up in blackface, and he didn't do it as a joke.
[13:40.640 --> 13:45.920]  He didn't do it to honor anybody. It was perhaps the most racist. We've had a lot of people
[13:45.920 --> 13:51.120]  who I think have been mischaracterized because they dressed in a Halloween costume. I don't
[13:51.120 --> 13:55.080]  think those mischaracterization of Coonman, but nothing the guy does. Well, he talks
[13:55.080 --> 14:01.640]  about killing kids by setting them aside over, you know, just comfort care is what they call
[14:01.640 --> 14:06.800]  it. And of course, what people did not realize until the governor of Virginia mentioned it
[14:06.800 --> 14:12.240]  was that that has been a standard of quote unquote care for children that they tried
[14:12.240 --> 14:19.880]  to abort and then managed to survive the attempt to murder them, tear them apart limb by limb.
[14:19.880 --> 14:25.360]  They stick them over in the side and then let them die. And they call that comfort care.
[14:25.360 --> 14:29.840]  Now that was something that came out during the Gosnell trial. The jury that was selected
[14:29.840 --> 14:35.560]  for the Gosnell trial was absolutely stunned, even though they were pro-abortion. They had
[14:35.560 --> 14:42.480]  to support Roe v. Wade in order to be selected as a juror. And so in the same way as Ralph
[14:42.480 --> 14:47.640]  Northam explained to the rest of America what standard practice was in many states already,
[14:47.640 --> 14:51.640]  and people couldn't believe it. They thought this is something new in Virginia. What is
[14:51.640 --> 14:57.840]  going on in Virginia is not just about Virginia. It'd be bad enough if it was limited to that.
[14:57.840 --> 15:04.280]  But the mandatory vaccinations, the messing with the electoral college, legalizing voter
[15:04.280 --> 15:09.040]  fraud, all these different aspects are happening now in Virginia. And they're coming from
[15:09.040 --> 15:16.920]  the Democrats. Last week we had Roger Scruton, a conservative out of the UK, passed away.
[15:16.920 --> 15:20.120]  A lot of people are looking at a lot of his work. I'm not that familiar with his work,
[15:20.120 --> 15:27.200]  but I saw one thing where he was spot on. And what he said was totalitarianism. We're
[15:27.200 --> 15:32.360]  not talking just about authoritarianism here. We're talking about totalitarianism. It means
[15:32.360 --> 15:38.480]  that there's no restrictions on the central government's powers. And everything, everything,
[15:38.480 --> 15:43.640]  every detail of your life will be decided by them. And I saw that told my wife that
[15:43.640 --> 15:56.640]  describes a Democrat party better than anybody could. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[15:56.640 --> 16:02.040]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[16:02.040 --> 16:07.440]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[16:07.440 --> 16:14.040]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[16:14.040 --> 16:19.920]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[16:19.920 --> 16:25.320]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses. They began studying this effect in published
[16:25.320 --> 16:30.680]  trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable
[16:30.680 --> 16:36.880]  tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms. Pollen block is natural and effective.
[16:36.880 --> 16:41.440]  It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by
[16:41.440 --> 16:46.720]  blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory
[16:46.720 --> 16:53.080]  responses in the body. Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to infowarslife.com
[16:53.080 --> 16:56.440]  and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[16:56.440 --> 17:02.120]  InfoWarsStore.com, we have a new product, and we got several thousand of these in, and
[17:02.120 --> 17:05.000]  they're going to sell out in a few days at the rate we're selling them. I want to thank
[17:05.000 --> 17:10.600]  the listeners for getting it, but this really is a game-changing toothpaste, and it doesn't
[17:10.600 --> 17:16.120]  compete with super blue that's 4 to 5 of colloidal silver and iodine and fluoride-free,
[17:16.120 --> 17:20.440]  the adult or the children's. These are both excellent toothpaste, concentrates that don't
[17:20.440 --> 17:26.320]  have fillers. People love it. This is a whitening toothpaste that also has the above sea coral
[17:26.320 --> 17:33.000]  calcium that also cleans, but also re-mineralizes the teeth. Then it has the patented silver
[17:33.000 --> 17:37.480]  salt, silver in it to knock out the bacteria that cause ginsivitis. This is all proven.
[17:37.480 --> 17:42.560]  You can make claims with this, but I have to tell you, no one has a toothpaste this good
[17:42.560 --> 17:47.760]  for knocking out the bacteria, the viruses, and cleaning the teeth in a healthy way that
[17:47.760 --> 17:53.240]  doesn't strip away the enamel. So, we're really proud of it. It funds the operation infowarsstore.com,
[17:53.240 --> 18:19.240]  and that's why we're still on air. Thanks to you.
[18:19.240 --> 18:24.400]  Folks, I'm telling you, you can see the difference in me, my energy, my focus. I've lost almost
[18:24.400 --> 18:30.560]  40 pounds in less than four months. It's incredible. So, do yourself a favor. Try out the products
[18:30.560 --> 18:34.960]  if you've been on the fence. You can't lose, except if you don't take action. Because when
[18:34.960 --> 18:39.520]  you buy the products, you're funding the operation that is always delivering thanks
[18:39.520 --> 18:44.120]  to your support and God's grace in our action. But you need these products. That's the real
[18:44.120 --> 18:48.200]  reason you want to get them is because they're amazing. And then when you get great results,
[18:48.200 --> 18:53.240]  please tell others about it word of mouth. That's how we expand in the face of the NWO
[19:19.200 --> 19:25.400]  and the Deep State trying to trigger a civil emergency in Virginia. We've got our teams
[19:25.400 --> 19:30.440]  on the ground. We'll be covering all of it. But the only way we're able to put the truth
[19:30.440 --> 19:38.040]  out is you magnifying it by sharing the links from band.video and newswars.com forward slash
[19:38.040 --> 19:44.560]  show. Newswars.com forward slash show and band.video. We have a whole live Trump trial
[19:44.560 --> 19:49.040]  and Virginia coverage page. And as the latest live feeds go up, where's the latest reports
[19:49.040 --> 19:55.160]  go up, they're posted right there at band.video. So click that link and share it. It's a revolutionary
[19:55.160 --> 20:20.440]  act and it's powerful. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Waging war on corruption.
[20:20.440 --> 20:33.520]  Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war. All right, welcome
[20:33.520 --> 20:39.880]  back. I'm David Knight and we have Alex Jones in Virginia. Of course, he will be there tomorrow.
[20:39.880 --> 20:44.600]  The day that they were going to have, you know, they've been doing this since 2003.
[20:44.600 --> 20:50.360]  And now this has become a national emergency, a declared state of emergency in Virginia.
[20:50.360 --> 20:57.600]  And we had the group that Virginia Citizens Defense League and gun owners of America filed
[20:57.600 --> 21:03.280]  an appeal that went all the way to the Supreme Court trying to say the governor of Virginia
[21:03.280 --> 21:10.720]  is trying to create an emergency out of nothing. And many people, including state representatives
[21:10.720 --> 21:15.680]  are worried that there is a false flag that is being set up here as well. But let's talk
[21:15.680 --> 21:22.320]  about what happened at the Supreme Court when the governor issued his order on Wednesday
[21:22.320 --> 21:28.120]  as gun owners of America says the unconstitutional order. And I think that it was I think what
[21:28.120 --> 21:34.880]  he's trying to do is to shut down the First Amendment as well, you know, Democrats. So
[21:34.880 --> 21:40.800]  everywhere in every aspect of our life, they will tell you what you can say what you can
[21:40.800 --> 21:45.440]  do. And this is just another example of it. They said remarkably, the Virginia Supreme
[21:45.440 --> 21:52.680]  Court did not reject our arguments on their merits. But they declined to rule, asserting
[21:52.680 --> 21:58.080]  that there was insufficient evidence to determine whether the circuit court had abused its discretion.
[21:58.080 --> 22:04.880]  So what they're saying is the we're not going to hear this because, you know, regardless
[22:04.880 --> 22:09.680]  of the merits that you've got here, we're not going to talk about judicial supremacy.
[22:09.680 --> 22:16.920]  And that is the key issue here, folks. We have got to stop appealing to the judiciary
[22:16.920 --> 22:23.400]  for everything. Everything. I talk about this frequently on my show here in the mornings,
[22:23.400 --> 22:28.000]  just like Cato the Elder said after every speech, regardless of what the topic was. Oh, and
[22:28.000 --> 22:33.960]  one more thing, Carthage must be destroyed. Well, the enemy of the American Republic is
[22:33.960 --> 22:40.080]  not some foreign enemy. It is the federal judiciary and the idea that judges will set
[22:40.080 --> 22:46.400]  in judgment of everything that people do in their own private lives. Every detail of our
[22:46.400 --> 22:51.200]  lives that they will define when life begins, they will define what marriage is. They will
[22:51.200 --> 22:58.160]  tell the president whether or not he can overthrow or overturn a an executive order from the
[22:58.160 --> 23:02.920]  previous president. I mean, if Obama's got the authority to put in an executive order
[23:02.920 --> 23:08.360]  saying he's not going to enforce immigration law, why is it that Trump is not allowed to
[23:08.360 --> 23:12.360]  say, well, that was what he said with his executive order. Now I'm going to have an executive order
[23:12.360 --> 23:17.120]  saying we are going to enforce immigration law. You have one federal judge out of hundreds
[23:17.120 --> 23:23.800]  or thousands that will come in and say, well, you can't do that. And then everything stops
[23:23.800 --> 23:30.080]  for years. This is judicial tyranny. And it comes from the idea of judicial supremacy.
[23:30.080 --> 23:34.440]  And here again, in this order, coming from the Virginia state, well, we're not going
[23:34.440 --> 23:38.400]  to say the circuit court doesn't have authority here. Of course, they have authority. They're
[23:38.400 --> 23:44.200]  never going to challenge anything that any judge ever says. And there are ways that
[23:44.200 --> 23:49.480]  we can do this peacefully. We can challenge them with nullification. We can challenge
[23:49.480 --> 23:54.080]  them with state nullification. We can do it at the county levels. That's what all of this
[23:54.080 --> 24:00.520]  sanctuary city stuff is about. I think that is a very, very positive outcome. We have
[24:00.520 --> 24:05.760]  sanctuary cities for the Second Amendment that have sprung up all over Virginia, a lot
[24:05.760 --> 24:11.800]  of different jurisdictions. And of course, even here in Texas now, we have three cities
[24:11.800 --> 24:18.440]  that have declared themselves sanctuary cities for life, saying we are not going to because
[24:18.440 --> 24:23.320]  the Supreme Court at one point in time decided, well, okay, you can you can kill if you want
[24:23.320 --> 24:29.800]  to any baby in the first trimester. And we're not going to say that we're not going to allow
[24:29.800 --> 24:33.800]  you to protect that baby's life. You can protect it in the second and third trimester if you
[24:33.800 --> 24:39.000]  want, but not in the first. Just arbitrarily cutting the baby and thirds like that. And
[24:39.000 --> 24:43.960]  so you've got three areas here in Texas saying we're going to be sanctuary cities for that.
[24:43.960 --> 24:49.960]  That's the way you do it. You nullify based on the Ninth and 10th Amendment, you nullify
[24:49.960 --> 24:56.960]  these power usurpations by the federal government. And it's typically the judiciary. The federal
[24:56.960 --> 25:02.480]  government is not above the state and local governments. And the judiciary is not above
[25:02.480 --> 25:06.720]  the other branches of the government. We have to understand that or we're going to continue
[25:06.720 --> 25:12.080]  to lose ground. As a matter of fact, we talk about nullification in Virginia. We now have
[25:12.080 --> 25:21.040]  as of just the last day and this has happened since November the 6th. We've had 136 counties,
[25:21.040 --> 25:27.080]  towns, and cities declare themselves to be Second Amendment sanctuary counties in Virginia
[25:27.080 --> 25:33.160]  136. That's called nullification. Peaceful nullification. You have sheriff saying we're
[25:33.160 --> 25:37.480]  not going to arrest people. As a matter of fact, if need be, I'll do a background check
[25:37.480 --> 25:43.080]  on these people and I will make them deputies so that you can't take their guns away.
[25:43.080 --> 25:49.120]  So that is the important thing. Now, where is this going to end? As we see, I talked
[25:49.120 --> 25:55.040]  about it in the last segment, the story that we have at infowarsstore.com showing the military
[25:55.040 --> 25:59.040]  equipment that's moving in in a lot of places. We also have the stories that you'll find
[25:59.040 --> 26:05.640]  at infowars.com. Pictures of what they're doing in terms of adding chain link fences.
[26:05.640 --> 26:10.360]  They're rapidly building chain link fences. As a matter of fact, they have a big rectangular
[26:10.360 --> 26:19.040]  area one way in and one way out. That's it. Only one opening. They have a corral for you.
[26:19.040 --> 26:24.200]  And we've seen this type of thing. As a matter of fact, when I first came here back in 2012,
[26:24.200 --> 26:31.640]  that was, you know, presidential election year. And every single convention that the
[26:31.640 --> 26:35.920]  Republicans and the Democrats have, both parties, when they have their presidential nominating
[26:35.920 --> 26:42.720]  conventions, they will have law enforcement corral people far away from the venue site.
[26:42.720 --> 26:50.520]  But people in cages literally put you in cages and you can exercise your free speech in their
[26:50.520 --> 26:57.600]  designated free speech zones. And that was the first report that I did when I came here
[26:57.600 --> 27:02.760]  to infowars, talking about free speech zones. Within a couple of years, I was at the Bundy
[27:02.760 --> 27:11.000]  Ranch and you had the BLM out in the middle of nowhere, create a fenced in area and then
[27:11.000 --> 27:16.640]  put up at a professionally printed sign that said, free speech area. And somebody wrote
[27:16.640 --> 27:23.360]  a handwritten sign and put it on it and said, free speech is not an area. And you better
[27:23.360 --> 27:29.600]  not let them infringe on your rights. You know, that's the way the Second Amendment
[27:29.600 --> 27:34.280]  is set up for a reason. There you go. You can see what that is. I had like a silt fence
[27:34.280 --> 27:40.800]  out there with a sign. The First Amendment as well as the Second Amendment, Second Amendment,
[27:40.800 --> 27:45.480]  they realized they're not going to come in and just pass a law and say, turn in all your
[27:45.480 --> 27:49.240]  guns because that will create a civil war if they try to do that. It'll create a civil
[27:49.240 --> 27:53.800]  war if they try to do that in Virginia. They figured the way that it would happen would
[27:53.800 --> 28:01.660]  be by a gradual process of infringement, you know, taking the fence between you and your
[28:01.660 --> 28:07.520]  neighbor and your neighbor moves that fence a couple of feet and you leave it there for
[28:07.520 --> 28:12.760]  a certain period of time. And most jurisdictions, they will say, well, you accepted that. And
[28:12.760 --> 28:17.200]  so now that additional foot that he's moved his fence onto your property, that's now
[28:17.200 --> 28:23.440]  this property. And they're not only fencing in and infringing on our Second Amendment
[28:23.440 --> 28:29.560]  rights, but now they literally do it at every convention, Republican or Democrat. Going
[28:29.560 --> 28:35.560]  back to the 2016 that free speech zone they had in Cleveland backfired. They had to pay
[28:35.560 --> 28:42.120]  out $325,000 to people for harassing and arresting them because they weren't in their little
[28:42.120 --> 28:46.320]  free speech cages. Well, we're not going to let free speech be put in a cage. We're not
[28:46.320 --> 28:48.660]  going to allow the Constitution to be overthrown. We're going to tell you more about what's
[28:48.660 --> 28:56.480]  going on in Richmond. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[28:56.480 --> 29:00.560]  I love watching David Knight in the morning. I love tuning in to Owen Schroyer. I love
[29:00.560 --> 29:05.080]  all the other shows we do here, but I'll be honest with you, we run during the breaks
[29:05.080 --> 29:10.240]  a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads show. You think you don't
[29:10.240 --> 29:14.560]  want to hear an ad? I don't want to hear an ad. But here's the bottom line. We're barely
[29:14.560 --> 29:18.240]  paying the bills here and I want to expand the face of the globalists, not contract.
[29:18.240 --> 29:22.920]  I don't want them to win. So listen, you've got this guarantee for me. We sell enough
[29:22.920 --> 29:27.720]  product, we'll have less ads and less plugs and we'll expand and really give the globalists
[29:27.720 --> 29:32.120]  run for their money. But we've got products you already really need like DNA Force Plus,
[29:32.120 --> 29:36.200]  X2, these will change your life. Go check out the turmeric products, check out the water

[30:58.960 --> 31:05.280]  in the world. A lot of people that never deliver. Well, I'm here to tell you InfoWars has delivered
[31:05.280 --> 31:12.760]  in royal flush, in a handful of ace of spades because of God, because of the audience of
[31:12.760 --> 31:19.200]  activist and because of the great team at InfoWars and we are all a team, ladies and gentlemen.
[31:19.200 --> 31:23.920]  So right now, humanity is awakening, it's explosive, it's powerful, it's incredible,
[31:23.920 --> 31:28.560]  but there's major obstacles coming down the road and the only way we can effectively fight
[31:28.560 --> 31:33.240]  the NWO and stay in the game on InfoWars is to tip the spear. As your financial support,
[31:33.240 --> 31:39.520]  make it really easy at InfoWarsStore.com, but I am blowing through our backup money
[31:39.520 --> 31:43.720]  right now with our reporters doing triple the work they ever have because they volunteered
[31:43.720 --> 31:48.680]  to do it and Owen and the rest of the crew will fight 18 hours a day, 7 days a week during
[31:48.680 --> 31:52.760]  this election year that's so critical, but they need the financing to put them in the
[31:52.760 --> 31:56.960]  field. Go to InfoWarsStore.com and fight for your own future.
[31:56.960 --> 32:03.880]  Knock on wood, I am not tempting fate, but everybody around the office, especially folks
[32:03.880 --> 32:09.520]  that have worked there a long time, have noticed that I really don't ever get sick. Now, again,
[32:09.520 --> 32:13.960]  I might get sick tomorrow because I just made that statement, I'm not tempting fate. I'll
[32:13.960 --> 32:17.920]  say that again because I am superstitious when it comes down to that. I'm very thankful
[32:17.920 --> 32:23.400]  to the good Lord for the Constitution I've been given, but up until about eight, nine
[32:23.400 --> 32:29.920]  years ago when I started taking X2 and the products InfoWarsLife, I still got sick every
[32:29.920 --> 32:35.920]  couple years and I still get sore throats from allergies and pollen and things like that,
[32:35.920 --> 32:41.760]  but now that I religiously take the products to InfoWarsLife, one of the highest quality
[32:41.760 --> 32:47.600]  stuff that you're going to find out there, I just never get a fever anymore. It's probably
[32:47.600 --> 32:54.920]  been three, four years since I've had a fever. It's just crazy. So I chalk it up to genetics
[32:54.920 --> 33:24.000]  and the great products. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Welcome back. I'm David
[33:24.000 --> 33:31.280]  Knight and Alex Jones is in Virginia. He was in the Washington, D.C. area yesterday with
[33:31.280 --> 33:40.880]  the women's march, joining them in their protest of masculinity with his pink hat. No, he's
[33:40.880 --> 33:48.400]  not gone to the other side, but he was just trying to support them, of course. Free speech
[33:48.400 --> 33:55.600]  and all that. Now, I think the best way that you oppose some of these issues is to let
[33:55.600 --> 34:01.560]  them talk. Just let them talk. And then, of course, we can offer our point of view, but
[34:01.560 --> 34:05.240]  that is not something that they are willing to do. And we're going to talk about the free
[34:05.240 --> 34:12.760]  speech aspects of this rally and other areas where they are trying to take our free speech
[34:12.760 --> 34:18.120]  away. We're going to talk about the militarization there and the compartmentalization of free
[34:18.120 --> 34:22.400]  speech and we're going to talk about the aspects as to whether or not there will be violence.
[34:22.400 --> 34:28.920]  Is there going to be an insider anti-fog group? And we've had reports of that. Now, we've
[34:28.920 --> 34:34.960]  had a lot of mainstream press reports talking to one particular anti-fog group and saying,
[34:34.960 --> 34:39.160]  we're not like all the rest of the anti-fog groups across the country, especially on the
[34:39.160 --> 34:44.080]  West Coast. We're not like those guys who show up with polls and nails on the ends of
[34:44.080 --> 34:48.240]  them and start whacking people. We're not like that at all. No, no, no. We support your
[34:48.240 --> 34:55.880]  right to free speech. And we support your right to have arms. And perhaps they do because
[34:55.880 --> 35:02.600]  they've made some interesting statements about how racist gun control laws have been in the
[35:02.600 --> 35:08.080]  past. You have to understand the real racists, the real authoritarians are the ones who want
[35:08.080 --> 35:11.920]  to take away your guns. They also want to take away your speech. So perhaps that particular
[35:11.920 --> 35:19.680]  group is along on board with that. But that doesn't mean that there aren't other groups.
[35:19.680 --> 35:25.800]  And the fact that you have reports of other groups that are being bused in from other
[35:25.800 --> 35:31.120]  areas, other anti-fog groups, that's not being covered by the mainstream media. They're
[35:31.120 --> 35:36.400]  trying to tell everybody, yeah, if there's any anti-fog there, they're there to support
[35:36.400 --> 35:40.760]  the gun protesters. Well, we'll wait and see about that. I've got more to say about that.
[35:40.760 --> 35:46.320]  I want to, before we get to those two aspects of it, I want to talk about the aspects of
[35:46.320 --> 35:53.440]  elections. You know, we have the Supreme Court is about to rule on whether or not electoral
[35:53.440 --> 35:59.040]  college voters are going to have to support the popular vote winner in their state. Now,
[35:59.040 --> 36:03.640]  this is a scheme that the Democrats have come up with. And I think as we look at this across
[36:03.640 --> 36:09.560]  the board, as I said before, first of all, the Democrats today are not just authoritarian.
[36:09.560 --> 36:15.680]  In other words, they don't want to just dictate aspects to your life. They are totalitarian.
[36:15.680 --> 36:22.200]  They don't want any restrictions on anything that can be done at the level of central government.
[36:22.200 --> 36:27.000]  Just like what Elizabeth Warren and the Democrats were talking about last week, and they didn't
[36:27.000 --> 36:32.080]  get questioned on Elizabeth Warren. Well, I'm going to tell everybody that you can't
[36:32.080 --> 36:37.000]  build a home unless I approve of your building plans. They've got to be net zero and so forth.
[36:37.000 --> 36:42.680]  And then I'm going to hand out $50,000 to every one of you students if you got a student
[36:42.680 --> 36:48.120]  loan. And I don't need any permission from Congress to do this. I can do it by executive
[36:48.120 --> 36:53.600]  order. We've seen Kamala Harris say within 100 days, if I haven't had the Congress enact
[36:53.600 --> 37:00.960]  gun control, I'll do it myself with executive orders. So these people are not only authoritarian.
[37:00.960 --> 37:05.320]  They don't recognize a rule of law. They don't recognize any constitutional restrictions
[37:05.320 --> 37:14.520]  on their actions. But they also want to control every detail of your life. They are totalitarian.
[37:14.520 --> 37:22.000]  And they do this by changing the rules, moving the borders, moving the boundaries. And of
[37:22.000 --> 37:25.680]  course, one of the things that they want to get rid of is the Electoral College. I said
[37:25.680 --> 37:32.680]  this week in the morning show, I said, think about the fact, as Iowa, there was an article
[37:32.680 --> 37:38.520]  where it was on Politico and they were saying the Democrats are very concerned about the
[37:38.520 --> 37:43.080]  fact that they're going to report actual vote totals in Iowa because it could allow more
[37:43.080 --> 37:47.000]  than one Democrat to claim victory. You could have the person who wins the most delegates
[37:47.000 --> 37:50.520]  and then you could have the person who won the popular vote in Iowa. They could both
[37:50.520 --> 37:57.480]  declare victory. And I said, it's not like that didn't happen before. Throughout the
[37:57.480 --> 38:03.880]  primary cycle four years ago, when you had Hillary and Bernie, it was a regular feature
[38:03.880 --> 38:10.480]  that Bernie would win the popular vote and then Hillary would get all the delegates.
[38:10.480 --> 38:18.680]  Or he would win, you know, 45% of the vote and she would get 75% of the delegates because
[38:18.680 --> 38:24.640]  of the superdelegates. And I point out, how hypocritical is it that we've now had Hillary
[38:24.640 --> 38:32.360]  for four years whining about the fact that she didn't win the Electoral College delegates
[38:32.360 --> 38:41.680]  when she won the nomination by using a delegate strategy to shove Bernie out. Now, this was
[38:41.680 --> 38:47.120]  something, when you look at how she got superdelegates, the fact that the DNC was millions of dollars
[38:47.120 --> 38:54.760]  in debt and the Clintons with their slush fund called the Clinton Foundation, patently illegal.
[38:54.760 --> 39:00.240]  They violated every rule for charitable foundations. I've talked to Charles Ortele many times.
[39:00.240 --> 39:03.920]  He's gone over and says, look, you have to file these. He's coming at it from an accounting
[39:03.920 --> 39:08.800]  basis, nothing other than an accounting basis. They've never filed the paperwork that they're
[39:08.800 --> 39:13.200]  supposed to file to be able to do this legally. Anybody else would have been shut down by
[39:13.200 --> 39:18.080]  the IRS, but not the Clinton Foundation. So they take all those millions of dollars and
[39:18.080 --> 39:24.560]  she pays off the debt of the DNC and she essentially owned it, lock, stock, and barrel. And the
[39:24.560 --> 39:30.200]  people who were Bernie supporters understood that she had robbed him of delegates. That's
[39:30.200 --> 39:36.520]  one of the reasons why it wasn't the Russians that hacked them. It was a whistleblower,
[39:36.520 --> 39:41.480]  a disgruntled Bernie supporter who released that information to WikiLeaks. And so she
[39:41.480 --> 39:46.160]  got everybody off on a red herring. Look, it was the Russians who hacked me. It wasn't
[39:46.160 --> 39:51.680]  disgruntled people because I stole the popular vote away from him using delegates. But now
[39:51.680 --> 39:56.240]  her strategy and the Democrat strategy for the last four years has been to say we're
[39:56.240 --> 40:00.360]  going to get rid of the electoral college. And that is now going to be coming up before
[40:00.360 --> 40:05.760]  the Supreme Court. And again, we're going to allow, going to allow the Supreme Court
[40:05.760 --> 40:12.120]  to have the final say in this. I don't think that that is the right way to proceed, but
[40:12.120 --> 40:15.560]  we'll just have to see what they're going to do. Washington State even the state Supreme
[40:15.560 --> 40:21.320]  Court and liberal Washington State has said that electors could be fined for not following
[40:21.320 --> 40:26.840]  the popular vote. The national popular vote movement is trying to make sure that all these
[40:26.840 --> 40:32.880]  people will change and throw away the votes in their state. Talk about throwing away your
[40:32.880 --> 40:40.600]  representation. But when we look at what happened in Virginia, Vince Agnelli in Virginia
[40:40.600 --> 40:47.000]  contacted me and said, you need to understand what's going on in Virginia. There were 43
[40:47.000 --> 40:58.920]  races where the GOP failed to even have a candidate. That amounts to 37% of the choices
[40:58.920 --> 41:06.160]  for the Senate had the races for the Senate had no Republican that they could choose 37.5%
[41:06.160 --> 41:13.000]  and in the house, they had 28% in Virginia had no Republican choice because they had
[41:13.000 --> 41:22.160]  more than 43 races where they didn't run a candidate. They only put up 72 candidates.
[41:22.160 --> 41:27.040]  Now you've got a lot of people on the Republican side are looking at this and saying the Democrats
[41:27.040 --> 41:35.520]  have become so authoritarian, so totalitarian in this move about gun control, not even talking
[41:35.520 --> 41:39.480]  about vaccines because mainstream media is not going to talk about the vaccination rules
[41:39.480 --> 41:44.040]  that are coming out of Virginia as well. But they're saying they have overplayed their
[41:44.040 --> 41:49.440]  hand and they've done it to the extent that it's going to backfire and northern is going
[41:49.440 --> 41:58.080]  to make Virginia a red state except they didn't run a full nearly 40% of the Senate races.
[41:58.080 --> 42:04.720]  They didn't even have a Republican candidate. You can't win if you don't show up. If you
[42:04.720 --> 42:10.200]  don't participate and see the thing I look at with this that makes me very concerned
[42:10.200 --> 42:15.800]  about it is the idea that many of us think that this is a spectator sport that we can
[42:15.800 --> 42:21.120]  just set this thing out. That all we have to do is make sure that we get the right president
[42:21.120 --> 42:25.040]  elected and then everything will just take care of itself. We don't have to worry about
[42:25.040 --> 42:30.560]  the state legislatures. We don't have to run for office ourselves. We don't have to get
[42:30.560 --> 42:36.000]  on a jury and nullify outrageous laws or mandatory minimums if they're going to be applied and
[42:36.000 --> 42:40.080]  say well you're going to put a mandatory minimum on this. I'm not going to convict that person
[42:40.080 --> 42:44.600]  because that violates the Constitution. I'm going to stand up for my fellow citizen on
[42:44.600 --> 42:57.240]  a wide variety of issues. All right we'll be right back. Stay with us.

[45:56.640 --> 46:00.880]  I want to talk about super silver whitening toothpaste because I hadn't tried it except
[46:00.880 --> 46:05.400]  for maybe the last week and a half and I told Alex. I said, man, this is the best toothpaste
[46:05.400 --> 46:08.440]  I've ever tried. He's like, well, what are you doing just sitting in here telling me?
[46:08.440 --> 46:13.840]  You got to get up there and tell people. So here I am telling people super silver whitening
[46:13.840 --> 46:19.360]  toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried and I'm 45 years old and I've tried
[46:19.360 --> 46:24.600]  a lot of different toothpaste and it's fluoride free. I think the big difference the game changer
[46:24.600 --> 46:29.400]  in this is the coral calcium because after I brush my teeth with this, they feel so clean
[46:29.400 --> 46:33.560]  and the toothpaste that I don't even like rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth
[46:33.560 --> 46:38.920]  with this. It feels so good. It feels like it feels like good things are happening in
[46:38.920 --> 46:44.360]  my mouth. In fact, I find myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather
[46:44.360 --> 46:59.640]  than just twice a day now because I like the way it feels.
[46:59.640 --> 47:14.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show live from the info wars.com studios. You're listening
[47:14.800 --> 47:28.160]  to the Alex Jones show and now your host David Knight. Welcome back. You know, we have all
[47:28.160 --> 47:35.160]  the mainstream media. We have vice talking about how, you know, not all these antifa
[47:35.160 --> 47:43.240]  groups are bad. We have one group called seven hills antifa seven hills in California and
[47:43.240 --> 47:48.320]  vice talked to them and said, you know, these people, they're on the same side as the people
[47:48.320 --> 47:55.760]  who support the second amendment. They quoted antifa seven Hills spokesperson called James
[47:55.760 --> 48:02.200]  no last name here. And that should concern you folks. When somebody doesn't want to give
[48:02.200 --> 48:10.320]  their full name, when they wear a mask, they're afraid of being identified. What are they
[48:10.320 --> 48:16.240]  trying to hide? I don't do this broadcast with a mask. I put my face on social media.
[48:16.240 --> 48:20.240]  I put my face on the broadcast. I'm not ashamed of what I have to say. Why are these people
[48:20.240 --> 48:25.040]  hiding behind anonymity? Anyway, said, I think it's been pretty important for us to focus
[48:25.040 --> 48:31.320]  on the fact that gun control in America has a legacy of racist enforcement. Well, yes,
[48:31.320 --> 48:36.040]  that's true. And I said in just the last segment, I said, you know, we can always hope that
[48:36.040 --> 48:40.600]  maybe these guys really do understand the purpose of the second amendment. Maybe they
[48:40.600 --> 48:46.960]  do really understand that the second amendment is not a white supremacist thing that gun
[48:46.960 --> 48:53.960]  control is a white supremacist thing or just a government supremacist thing, a tyranny
[48:53.960 --> 48:58.320]  thing, if you will. Because then how many thing to do with skin color? It did. I mean,
[48:58.320 --> 49:01.560]  you have different groups, and that's the way the Democrat Party has always worked.
[49:01.560 --> 49:08.440]  They've always sided with one group and pitted it against the other. That's the one thing
[49:08.440 --> 49:12.800]  that is consistent about the Democrats. But, you know, as Henry Kissinger said, we don't
[49:12.800 --> 49:20.040]  have permanent allies. We have permanent interests. Their interests are permanent power. And so
[49:20.040 --> 49:23.960]  they will switch sides. And they're switching sides now because of demographics. And they
[49:23.960 --> 49:28.720]  want to aid the demographics to make sure that white people are in the minority. And
[49:28.720 --> 49:32.320]  so they're coming after white people because, you know, that's what they've always done.
[49:32.320 --> 49:37.840]  When black people were in the minority, they would use black people as the escape goat.
[49:37.840 --> 49:42.240]  But anyway, this anti-foss seven Hills person says, like taking guns away from black people
[49:42.240 --> 49:47.040]  because black people were perceived as a threat to property and the sanctity of the state.
[49:47.040 --> 49:54.560]  Well, that's not why they they took it away. But nevertheless, there was, as New American
[49:54.560 --> 50:00.760]  points out, there were a lot of laws that went back to the 1830s and a lot of them continued
[50:00.760 --> 50:07.360]  through the Jim Crow era of the South into the 20th century. You had laws like one in
[50:07.360 --> 50:12.000]  Georgia from 1833, it shall not be lawful for any free person of color in this state
[50:12.000 --> 50:18.280]  to own, use or carry firearms of any description, whatever. You see, the founders of this country
[50:18.280 --> 50:26.120]  knew that if you take away people's guns, you can enslave them. That was what was really
[50:26.120 --> 50:32.480]  about was about slavery. And that's why this week when we had people from West Virginia,
[50:32.480 --> 50:41.400]  you had a delegate, you had state elected officials in West Virginia, put together resolution
[50:41.400 --> 50:48.400]  and offered anybody in these 130, what is it, 136 different jurisdictions in Virginia that
[50:48.400 --> 50:53.200]  have declared themselves sanctuary cities, they said, hey, and if you want to leave Virginia
[50:53.200 --> 50:57.280]  and become a part of West Virginia, you're welcome to do that. We welcome you to join
[50:57.280 --> 51:02.880]  our state and leave the state of Virginia. Why? Because again, it's about slavery, isn't
[51:02.880 --> 51:08.880]  it? That's why West Virginia left in the first place. But folks, all of this narrative that's
[51:08.880 --> 51:13.560]  being put out by vice, and it was picked up by the dredged report, and we've seen articles
[51:13.560 --> 51:18.120]  from the Daily Caller, we've seen articles from Breitbart and so forth, New American.
[51:18.120 --> 51:25.960]  I don't buy the fact that even Antifa Seven Hills supports the Second Amendment or any
[51:25.960 --> 51:30.760]  kind of freedom. They are as authoritarian and as dangerous, and I think they will be
[51:30.760 --> 51:35.720]  as violent as any of these other Antifa groups. And we've seen it primarily on the West Coast.
[51:35.720 --> 51:42.720]  So we disagree with the people on the West Coast. And yet they have published a hit list,
[51:42.720 --> 51:46.360]  the same group that's telling us that they want to march alongside. This has just come
[51:46.360 --> 51:54.760]  out. Rob Dew tweeted this, and this just came across my desk. Antifa Seven Hills has published
[51:54.760 --> 52:01.960]  a list of known fascist and sympathizers that will be in Richmond. So come after these people.
[52:01.960 --> 52:07.760]  It's a hit list. These people say, we're going to march alongside the people who are in support
[52:07.760 --> 52:11.840]  of the Second Amendment and the right to keep and bear arms. And then they put out a hit
[52:11.840 --> 52:17.080]  list. Guess who's on it? Well, we've got Alex Jones. We've got Owen Schroyer. We've got
[52:17.080 --> 52:20.760]  Mike Adams. We've got Jacob Ingalls, who's with the Gateway Pundit. We've got Patrick
[52:20.760 --> 52:32.240]  Cowley. And I am offended that I'm not on that list. I'm telling you that Antifa is Antifa.
[52:32.240 --> 52:38.480]  They are true fascists. They are not against fascism. They're Marxists, as you've seen,
[52:38.480 --> 52:44.320]  you know, they're Marxists. They promote violence. And yet they are being lauded. They are being
[52:44.320 --> 52:49.680]  celebrated. As I said in the last segment, nobody is concerned about Antifa groups that
[52:49.680 --> 52:57.960]  are traveling to this peaceful assembly to redress their grievances, which is what they've
[52:57.960 --> 53:06.680]  done every year. Lobby day from the Virginia Citizens' Defense League. VCDL, I think is
[53:06.680 --> 53:10.280]  the name of the organization that's put this together. And they pointed out, they said,
[53:10.280 --> 53:15.880]  look, this is not, we don't want you coming here to threaten anybody. But, you know, carrying
[53:15.880 --> 53:20.560]  your gun to show that you are a gun owner, that's a legitimate thing. It is legal to
[53:20.560 --> 53:28.120]  open, carry in Virginia. And as I've said on the warning program, I said, every time
[53:28.120 --> 53:36.960]  I've been at a protest or rally where people openly carried, you know, they slung rifles
[53:36.960 --> 53:44.440]  over their shoulders or they had pistols in holsters or whatever, there was never a problem.
[53:44.440 --> 53:50.160]  It was, they were always the most peaceful demonstrations we've ever had. Why is that?
[53:50.160 --> 53:56.240]  Well, it's because an armed society is a polite society, as Robert Heinlein said. And this
[53:56.240 --> 54:00.400]  was something that went back to the Civil War. I've talked many times about how a British
[54:00.400 --> 54:05.960]  officer, Colonel Arthur Fremantle of the Coldstream Guards came to the U.S. during the Civil War
[54:05.960 --> 54:11.840]  to look at fighting tactics. And he said, I've never seen a society like the South where
[54:11.840 --> 54:17.560]  everybody is armed. And I've never seen a society where everybody is so polite. Robert
[54:17.560 --> 54:22.600]  Heinlein, the science fiction writer just distilled it, said an armed society is a polite society.
[54:22.600 --> 54:26.920]  If you are antifa, you're not going to come up and whack somebody in the back of the head
[54:26.920 --> 54:31.840]  unless you're just suicidal. I mean, you might do that. People do just like we saw with the
[54:31.840 --> 54:36.640]  church shooting here in Texas. A guy pulls out a gun and starts shooting. He didn't think,
[54:36.640 --> 54:43.080]  I think, that anybody had a gun there. I guess he thought he was going to get away with it.
[54:43.080 --> 54:46.440]  But there might be some people who would be suicidal, crazy enough to do that, but they're
[54:46.440 --> 54:51.080]  not going to get too far. But most people are rational enough that in an armed society
[54:51.080 --> 54:55.240]  they're not going to pull something like that. That was the point of the quote-unquote Wild
[54:55.240 --> 55:02.840]  West. The Wild West was not nearly as wild as Baltimore, Chicago, or Washington, D.C.,
[55:02.840 --> 55:07.880]  any of these gun control areas. You didn't have those types, that type of violence. Yeah,
[55:07.880 --> 55:13.240]  you had people who would have a shootout on the street or something like that, and you
[55:13.240 --> 55:19.800]  would have highway robbers who would ambush stagecoaches. But they typically didn't have
[55:19.800 --> 55:23.960]  the kinds of violence that we see here, preying on unarmed people. And when they did something
[55:23.960 --> 55:31.560]  like that, the sheriff called out the power of the community, Posse Comitatus. The Posse
[55:31.560 --> 55:35.800]  would take care of that type of thing. Alex Jones is going to be joining us coming up
[55:35.800 --> 55:42.240]  in the next hour. He is in the Virginia Capitol, and we're going to continue to talk about
[55:42.240 --> 55:48.000]  what is going on in Virginia. And it is about more than the Second Amendment. It's about
[55:48.000 --> 55:54.720]  more than just having firearms. If you don't understand and appreciate individual liberty,
[55:54.720 --> 56:03.000]  and if you think like Elizabeth Warren or the Andrew Yang who has, he has a plan for
[56:03.000 --> 56:08.360]  every tiny detail of your life. These people don't support your choice, your freedom in
[56:08.360 --> 56:12.520]  anything. They call themselves pro-choice. You know, they're going to shove vaccines
[56:12.520 --> 56:20.360]  into your arm and uncontrolled numbers, and that is a part of the new Democrat legislature's
[56:20.360 --> 56:27.560]  agenda in Virginia as well. I have two vaccine bills that are just as outrageous, and people
[56:27.560 --> 56:32.240]  ought to be demonstrating against them as much as they are all of these different gun control
[56:32.240 --> 56:36.840]  bills. I mean, they want to shut down all indoor shooting ranges. They want to have universal
[56:36.840 --> 56:41.400]  gun registration. That's what universal background checks are about. That was the UN Arm Trade
[56:41.400 --> 56:49.080]  Treaty that they tried to create a crisis and get that pushed. That's what the Gunwalker
[56:49.080 --> 56:53.960]  Program was about, the Fast and Furious, which even the New York Times called a false flag.
[56:53.960 --> 57:01.160]  All of those were to push a UN Arms Trade Treaty, and the goal of the UN Arm Trade Treaty was
[57:01.160 --> 57:06.120]  to make sure that every gun owner and every piece of equipment and piece of ammunition
[57:06.120 --> 57:11.160]  was registered. And that is a prelude to confiscation.
[57:11.160 --> 57:14.240]  All right, before we go to break, I just want to remind you of the specials that we have
[57:14.240 --> 57:18.480]  at InfowarsStore.com. We have a lot of reporters on the scene right now. We're going to give

[58:51.560 --> 58:55.880]  You don't want my thanks. You want victory over the globalist and these devil worship

[59:26.400 --> 59:30.600]  For the bottom of my heart, for my family, and for the great crew at Infowars, I want
[59:30.600 --> 59:34.840]  to thank you all because you are the Infowar, and you know that's not just words, that's
[59:34.840 --> 59:43.200]  reality. You have made history. We have made history together. Infowars.com only has power
[59:43.200 --> 1:00:01.080]  because of you, and I suggest you use it.
[1:00:01.080 --> 1:00:16.840]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show, and now
[1:00:16.840 --> 1:00:17.840]  your host, David Knight.
[1:00:17.840 --> 1:00:23.280]  Well, we're told by Vice that these Antifa 7 Hills people, they're good guys. They understand
[1:00:23.280 --> 1:00:28.120]  that the Second Amendment isn't about white supremacy. As a matter of fact, they realize
[1:00:28.120 --> 1:00:36.960]  that the gun control has been used by racist Democrats in the 19th century, and especially
[1:00:36.960 --> 1:00:42.720]  in the 20th century, even during Jim Crow, to come after black people. So they said,
[1:00:42.720 --> 1:00:46.680]  all right, we're going to make common cause with these people. We're going to march alongside
[1:00:46.680 --> 1:00:53.480]  of them. As Vice reports, the case of Antifa 7 Hills, they believe they've got more in
[1:00:53.480 --> 1:00:58.880]  common with working class, white Virginians, regardless of their political bent than they
[1:00:58.880 --> 1:01:02.880]  do with many of the moderate Democrats who helped their party win control of the legislature
[1:01:02.880 --> 1:01:10.920]  in November for the first time since 1994. Oh, well, see, there you go. So Vice said
[1:01:10.920 --> 1:01:17.280]  that they see this as an opportunity to extend an olive branch to gun owners, except it's
[1:01:17.280 --> 1:01:21.680]  not an olive branch that they're actually putting out by their own admission. Now,
[1:01:21.680 --> 1:01:30.360]  let's forget about what Vice says, a left wing organization, and let's not take that
[1:01:30.360 --> 1:01:36.720]  at face value as Daily Caller, Breitbart, and others have, because that very group,
[1:01:36.720 --> 1:01:47.320]  Antifa 7 Hills, put out a hit list, pictures and information known fascist and sympathizers.
[1:01:47.320 --> 1:01:53.640]  Michael and Shroyer, Mike Adams, Jacob Ingalls, Patrick Howley, and others, many others.
[1:01:53.640 --> 1:02:00.200]  So so much for an olive branch. Can you believe this? Can you believe the narrative that's
[1:02:00.200 --> 1:02:06.760]  being put out there? We should never take anything that Antifa says at face value. They're
[1:02:06.760 --> 1:02:13.440]  not anti fascist. They're anti FA First Amendment. They will try to kill you for your speech.
[1:02:13.440 --> 1:02:19.520]  So how in the world are they going to support your Second Amendment rights? Absolute nonsense.
[1:02:19.520 --> 1:02:23.560]  Alex Jones is going to be joining us probably in the next segment from Virginia. Talk about
[1:02:23.560 --> 1:02:27.840]  what he sees there on the ground. He didn't make I didn't make their list that Alex didn't
[1:02:27.840 --> 1:02:31.080]  make their list. But I guess they figured that Alex wasn't going to be there. They figured
[1:02:31.080 --> 1:02:37.040]  Owen would be there. So they they put him on the list. But we also have a state representative
[1:02:37.040 --> 1:02:45.760]  who came out and was very clear that she believes that this is a setup. We have a state senator
[1:02:45.760 --> 1:02:51.640]  Amanda Chase out of Virginia. She says, does the Patriot Act ring a bell? Does the National
[1:02:51.640 --> 1:02:56.080]  Defense Authorization Act ring a bell? If people show up wearing any kind of a uniform
[1:02:56.080 --> 1:03:01.960]  or a patch or any other symbol on their clothing signifying they belong to a militia and something
[1:03:01.960 --> 1:03:08.480]  goes wrong, you could and will be held as a domestic terrorist. If anyone steps out
[1:03:08.480 --> 1:03:12.840]  of line, all it takes is one person and it may be a government plant. It could be somebody
[1:03:12.840 --> 1:03:18.200]  from this peaceful anti-fog group or it could be somebody from one of the other anti-fog
[1:03:18.200 --> 1:03:23.520]  groups that don't even pretend to be peaceful and in agreement about the Second Amendment.
[1:03:23.520 --> 1:03:30.480]  They could show up. Anybody could show up wearing a MAGA cap and they could attack Democrats
[1:03:30.480 --> 1:03:37.520]  who are carrying gun control signs and it would be on. It would be a false flag and
[1:03:37.520 --> 1:03:43.440]  that's what everybody is very concerned about. But beyond the false flag aspects of this,
[1:03:43.440 --> 1:03:49.040]  I mean we don't even have to get to that if we look at what Ralph Northam has done now.
[1:03:49.040 --> 1:03:55.480]  Ralph Northam has created the Tender Box situation. The mainstream media is saying that there's
[1:03:55.480 --> 1:04:04.800]  people who have shown up like they do every year since 2003. So for the last 17 years,
[1:04:04.800 --> 1:04:10.600]  these people who are supporters of the Second Amendment have shown up for Lobby Day at the
[1:04:10.600 --> 1:04:16.960]  Virginia State Capitol. But this year it is a Tender Box. This year it is a show of force.
[1:04:16.960 --> 1:04:21.000]  This year we should be very afraid. This year we should have a state of emergency. And we
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:28.720]  have a Democrat delegate, Mark Levine, who says the muskets of our Founding Fathers also
[1:04:28.720 --> 1:04:33.440]  did not contain 30 bullet magazines. Hey, you know, Mark, you know what they did have?
[1:04:33.440 --> 1:04:39.400]  A Concord in Lexington and a Goliad when you had Santa Ana come there? They had cannons.
[1:04:39.400 --> 1:04:43.960]  They just have muskets. They had cannons. And if you read the Constitution, Article
[1:04:43.960 --> 1:04:50.280]  1, Section 8, Clause 15 says that you ought to be helping us to learn how to use these.
[1:04:50.280 --> 1:04:54.920]  The militia is not a dirty word. A standing army was a dirty word to the Founders.
[1:04:54.920 --> 1:05:02.680]  It is I, the leader of Cobra here for a message to President Trump, the American people, and
[1:05:02.680 --> 1:05:09.440]  Alex Jones of InfoWords. Our operations with our partners, the Communist Chinese, have
[1:05:09.440 --> 1:05:16.960]  bought control of your media. But it's true, your people are beginning to awaken. That's
[1:05:16.960 --> 1:05:23.960]  why Cobra is launching operations to trigger race war, mass shootings and bombings, which
[1:05:23.960 --> 1:05:31.080]  will be blamed on those loyal to America. Anyone once we stage these attacks that does
[1:05:31.080 --> 1:05:39.760]  not blame it on Trump will also be targeted by Cobra in the future. You see, when you
[1:05:39.760 --> 1:05:47.120]  expose our false flags and fake media, I will carry out attacks and then blame you like
[1:05:47.120 --> 1:05:53.640]  we've done with Alex Jones blaming him for mass shootings we committed. Ha, ha, ha,
[1:05:53.640 --> 1:06:09.380]  Wilcop Kad... Welcome back, I'm David Keneyt here in the studio at Austin but we have
[1:06:09.380 --> 1:06:14.900]  Alex Jones at the state capitol in Richmond as we have the governor and the mainstream
[1:06:14.900 --> 1:06:19.340]  press try to ramp this up into a crisis. Thank you, Alex.
[1:06:19.340 --> 1:06:21.340]  What's going on there?
[1:06:21.340 --> 1:06:23.220]  Well, David, great job to you and the crew today
[1:06:23.220 --> 1:06:24.060]  with us on the road.
[1:06:24.060 --> 1:06:25.420]  We got a little bit later than we were supposed to be
[1:06:25.420 --> 1:06:26.260]  at the start of the show.
[1:06:26.260 --> 1:06:27.860]  You guys pulled it out and I dropped the ball.
[1:06:27.860 --> 1:06:30.420]  So really appreciate you guys getting that done.
[1:06:30.420 --> 1:06:32.980]  But we're here tonight right in the front
[1:06:32.980 --> 1:06:37.860]  of the militarized, contained with checkpoints
[1:06:37.860 --> 1:06:41.740]  here in Virginia at the Capitol
[1:06:41.740 --> 1:06:43.900]  where the governor and the corporate control media
[1:06:43.900 --> 1:06:47.660]  has hyped up that there's all these vicious armed people
[1:06:47.660 --> 1:06:49.420]  coming to overthrow the government.
[1:06:49.420 --> 1:06:50.460]  When it's the Democrats,
[1:06:50.460 --> 1:06:52.620]  funded by the Chai comms and others
[1:06:52.620 --> 1:06:54.780]  that have gotten into power through election fraud
[1:06:54.780 --> 1:06:55.620]  and who were saying,
[1:06:55.620 --> 1:06:57.620]  hell yes, we're going to take all your semi-autos.
[1:06:57.620 --> 1:06:59.780]  Hell yes, we're going to ban all of your gun shops.
[1:06:59.780 --> 1:07:01.980]  Hell yes, we're going to ban all of your shooting ranges.
[1:07:01.980 --> 1:07:03.140]  And hell yes, we're going to take them
[1:07:03.140 --> 1:07:04.460]  from your cold dead hands.
[1:07:04.460 --> 1:07:06.220]  So the people say we're going to have the same gun round
[1:07:06.220 --> 1:07:07.460]  we've always had.
[1:07:07.460 --> 1:07:08.780]  I'm Martin Luther King day and they go,
[1:07:08.780 --> 1:07:10.220]  oh my gosh, they're racist,
[1:07:10.220 --> 1:07:12.780]  but no one is buying it just like the Russia hoax,
[1:07:12.780 --> 1:07:14.540]  just like the Ukraine hoax,
[1:07:14.540 --> 1:07:17.420]  just like all these other hoaxes about Trump and America
[1:07:17.420 --> 1:07:18.500]  and Info Wars.
[1:07:18.500 --> 1:07:22.340]  We the people, David, as you know, are not buying this.
[1:07:22.340 --> 1:07:25.340]  And so again, we're going to be here tonight, tomorrow,
[1:07:25.340 --> 1:07:28.180]  and then in DC for the trial of the president,
[1:07:28.180 --> 1:07:30.300]  but they want to have something to embarrass the president
[1:07:30.300 --> 1:07:32.220]  and to stoke division in America
[1:07:32.220 --> 1:07:34.260]  ahead of the trial that starts Tuesday.
[1:07:34.260 --> 1:07:35.420]  So it's all perfectly timed.
[1:07:35.420 --> 1:07:38.340]  We know why Pelosi held back on the articles of impeachment
[1:07:38.340 --> 1:07:40.300]  and she rushed, you know, getting them passed
[1:07:40.300 --> 1:07:42.580]  because they're trying to time all this together.
[1:07:42.580 --> 1:07:45.820]  And they have Antifa, the Soros funded organization,
[1:07:45.820 --> 1:07:48.180]  the local chapter, it's on infowars.com
[1:07:48.180 --> 1:07:51.180]  and newswars.com saying there's a hit list of journalists
[1:07:51.180 --> 1:07:52.260]  they're going to attack,
[1:07:52.260 --> 1:07:54.100]  a hit list of people they're going to go after.
[1:07:54.100 --> 1:07:55.580]  And again, as you said, I guess they didn't think
[1:07:55.580 --> 1:07:56.420]  I was coming.
[1:07:56.420 --> 1:07:58.460]  Owen Schreuer is at the top of the list
[1:07:58.460 --> 1:08:02.180]  with Mike Adams of naturalnews.com, David.
[1:08:02.180 --> 1:08:03.020]  So we're here.
[1:08:03.020 --> 1:08:05.500]  You can continue any questions, comments you have.
[1:08:05.500 --> 1:08:08.900]  And then we're going to go up and if it's still open,
[1:08:08.900 --> 1:08:11.380]  try to go through the checkpoint or give you a tour
[1:08:11.380 --> 1:08:16.220]  of the classic Americana capital up there.
[1:08:16.220 --> 1:08:20.220]  It looks more like the White House or the Greek pantheon
[1:08:20.220 --> 1:08:21.300]  or is it Partheon?
[1:08:21.300 --> 1:08:24.340]  I was confused which one's Roman, which one is Greek.
[1:08:24.340 --> 1:08:28.980]  The one on top, the Acropolis in Greece show.
[1:08:28.980 --> 1:08:31.260]  We're here, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:08:31.260 --> 1:08:34.580]  And this is another Hail Mary by the left
[1:08:34.580 --> 1:08:35.980]  to create a huge hope.
[1:08:35.980 --> 1:08:38.260]  Just like they did to Charlottesville two years ago,
[1:08:38.260 --> 1:08:39.620]  that there's all these white supremacists
[1:08:39.620 --> 1:08:41.780]  of all this pollution and they want to project
[1:08:41.780 --> 1:08:45.580]  any pro-gun civil rights as if it's racist or bad.
[1:08:45.580 --> 1:08:47.660]  And they also want to project, again,
[1:08:47.660 --> 1:08:49.300]  onto Republicans and President Trump
[1:08:49.300 --> 1:08:51.660]  that they're extremists who need to be disarmed.
[1:08:51.660 --> 1:08:53.380]  But I really don't see the public buying it.
[1:08:53.380 --> 1:08:56.820]  At the last Soros funded women's march,
[1:08:56.820 --> 1:08:59.740]  they had about one 20th of what they had
[1:08:59.740 --> 1:09:02.420]  at the first big one in 2017.
[1:09:02.420 --> 1:09:06.260]  The DC police came out and said a hundred to one,
[1:09:06.260 --> 1:09:08.820]  this was at least a hundred times smaller.
[1:09:08.820 --> 1:09:11.860]  It's like Soros putting out over a hundred million dollars
[1:09:11.860 --> 1:09:13.460]  trying to fund this march.
[1:09:13.460 --> 1:09:17.860]  They had less than 30,000 people edit, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:09:17.860 --> 1:09:20.700]  So folks understand the deep states of fraud.
[1:09:20.700 --> 1:09:22.220]  They know that it's a hoax
[1:09:22.220 --> 1:09:23.740]  that Trump was a white supremacist.
[1:09:23.740 --> 1:09:25.300]  They know it's a hoax, all the stuff
[1:09:25.300 --> 1:09:26.580]  that he's a Russian agent.
[1:09:26.580 --> 1:09:29.420]  And so now they are clearly saying,
[1:09:29.420 --> 1:09:31.460]  they even have state senators here in Virginia.
[1:09:31.460 --> 1:09:34.260]  They have mainline analysts at the FBI saying,
[1:09:34.260 --> 1:09:36.460]  they believe that the Democrats and deep state
[1:09:36.460 --> 1:09:38.580]  are going to try to provocateur something tomorrow
[1:09:38.580 --> 1:09:41.460]  and Antifa has said they're going to dress up
[1:09:41.460 --> 1:09:43.900]  as Trump supporters officially
[1:09:43.900 --> 1:09:46.460]  and may even attack other leftists
[1:09:46.460 --> 1:09:47.900]  in some type of staged event.
[1:09:47.900 --> 1:09:50.860]  Alexander Soros, the secret documents we got two years ago,
[1:09:50.860 --> 1:09:53.540]  planned to try to trigger martial law in Maryland
[1:09:53.540 --> 1:09:55.100]  with Antifa dressed up,
[1:09:55.100 --> 1:09:57.340]  trying to then incite racial attacks
[1:09:57.340 --> 1:10:00.100]  and cause a race war with the police department
[1:10:00.100 --> 1:10:01.500]  and African-Americans.
[1:10:01.500 --> 1:10:02.660]  It did not happen.
[1:10:02.660 --> 1:10:05.220]  But this is the clash they continue to try to push
[1:10:05.220 --> 1:10:06.620]  to divide the country.
[1:10:06.620 --> 1:10:08.860]  But no one believes the mainstream media anymore.
[1:10:08.860 --> 1:10:10.740]  No one believes the Democrats anymore.
[1:10:10.740 --> 1:10:12.940]  No one buys any of this crap anymore.
[1:10:12.940 --> 1:10:14.540]  So is the deep state crazy enough
[1:10:14.540 --> 1:10:17.300]  to try to start something or a mass shooting tomorrow?
[1:10:17.300 --> 1:10:18.260]  Or will it happen here?
[1:10:18.260 --> 1:10:20.820]  Or will it happen somewhere else in the country
[1:10:20.820 --> 1:10:23.380]  so that they set the tone the day before
[1:10:23.380 --> 1:10:26.020]  the Senate trial of the president,
[1:10:26.020 --> 1:10:28.940]  which is a trial of the Democrats and their fraud, David.
[1:10:28.940 --> 1:10:31.180]  I really believe the planets have aligned.
[1:10:31.180 --> 1:10:33.260]  A lot of folks have been predicting they try something.
[1:10:33.260 --> 1:10:35.020]  They're definitely hyping it.
[1:10:35.020 --> 1:10:36.780]  Like they hype mass shootings, the studies show
[1:10:36.780 --> 1:10:39.180]  that causes crazies to go out and do mass shootings.
[1:10:39.180 --> 1:10:40.020]  Oh yeah.
[1:10:40.020 --> 1:10:41.660]  Are they trying to summon something like this?
[1:10:41.660 --> 1:10:42.500]  What do you think?
[1:10:42.500 --> 1:10:45.180]  Well, Alex, you talked about how George Soros
[1:10:45.180 --> 1:10:46.980]  funded these other marches
[1:10:46.980 --> 1:10:49.700]  and how they had a much smaller group
[1:10:49.700 --> 1:10:51.700]  than was expected to show up here.
[1:10:51.700 --> 1:10:54.340]  I think that even if they don't have
[1:10:54.340 --> 1:10:56.420]  some kind of a false flag attack here,
[1:10:56.420 --> 1:10:59.580]  I think all of this fear and uncertainty
[1:10:59.580 --> 1:11:01.900]  that's been sown with this state of emergency
[1:11:01.900 --> 1:11:02.860]  and all these preparations
[1:11:02.860 --> 1:11:04.500]  and all the media talking about this,
[1:11:04.500 --> 1:11:06.500]  I think a major part of this
[1:11:06.500 --> 1:11:08.500]  is to try to suppress turnout.
[1:11:08.500 --> 1:11:10.740]  I think it's there to scare people away and say,
[1:11:10.740 --> 1:11:11.580]  hey, if you come up,
[1:11:11.580 --> 1:11:13.900]  you're gonna be labeled a domestic terrorist.
[1:11:13.900 --> 1:11:15.060]  You're gonna be put on a list.
[1:11:15.060 --> 1:11:17.820]  You might get involved in violence and they wanna,
[1:11:17.820 --> 1:11:19.820]  so instead of subsidizing it,
[1:11:19.820 --> 1:11:22.820]  they're using their power to suppress the people
[1:11:22.820 --> 1:11:24.260]  who would normally come there
[1:11:24.260 --> 1:11:26.300]  and redress their grievances about these people
[1:11:26.300 --> 1:11:28.660]  trying to take away their Second Amendment rights.
[1:11:28.660 --> 1:11:29.500]  Well, that's it.
[1:11:29.500 --> 1:11:31.380]  Whether the left's able to stage an attack
[1:11:31.380 --> 1:11:34.340]  by having Antifa publicly infiltrate
[1:11:34.340 --> 1:11:37.460]  the Make America Great Again Pro Second Amendment patriots
[1:11:37.460 --> 1:11:39.340]  here fighting for their basic God-given rights
[1:11:39.340 --> 1:11:41.220]  and civil rights of every race, color, and creed.
[1:11:41.220 --> 1:11:44.220]  They care about the entire first 10 of the Bill of Rights.
[1:11:44.220 --> 1:11:46.260]  Even if they're unable to actually stage violence,
[1:11:46.260 --> 1:11:47.100]  which they're hoping for,
[1:11:47.100 --> 1:11:48.980]  which we're here to expose and fight against
[1:11:48.980 --> 1:11:50.020]  and pray doesn't happen,
[1:11:50.020 --> 1:11:52.980]  they've still created a state of fear and demonize those
[1:11:52.980 --> 1:11:55.220]  that are for the Second Amendment and the First Amendment
[1:11:55.220 --> 1:11:57.660]  as if gathering for redress and grievances
[1:11:57.660 --> 1:12:00.620]  to an out-of-control, tyrannical governor,
[1:12:00.620 --> 1:12:03.020]  blackface Northam and all the rest of this.
[1:12:03.020 --> 1:12:04.980]  When he's not keeping babies alive for their organs,
[1:12:04.980 --> 1:12:06.300]  he's dressed up in black place.
[1:12:06.300 --> 1:12:08.700]  This is a compromised, crazy person.
[1:12:08.700 --> 1:12:10.620]  And this is how he changes the subject
[1:12:10.620 --> 1:12:12.100]  from all the horrible things he's done.
[1:12:12.100 --> 1:12:13.060]  He's put on this stunt,
[1:12:13.060 --> 1:12:14.820]  we've confirmed from high-level sources
[1:12:14.820 --> 1:12:16.580]  that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton
[1:12:16.580 --> 1:12:19.700]  and the deep state are still running and controlling.
[1:12:19.700 --> 1:12:21.660]  So yes, that's why they went ahead and did it
[1:12:21.660 --> 1:12:24.060]  because, again, they need the distraction,
[1:12:24.060 --> 1:12:25.900]  they need to create the fear ahead of the Senate trial,
[1:12:25.900 --> 1:12:27.940]  the president, and they're crossing their fingers
[1:12:27.940 --> 1:12:29.580]  and hoping something bad happens.
[1:12:29.580 --> 1:12:31.140]  But I think there's so many patriots out here
[1:12:31.140 --> 1:12:32.300]  and so many good things.
[1:12:32.300 --> 1:12:36.020]  I mean, look, Antifa all look like child molester methods.
[1:12:36.020 --> 1:12:37.820]  They've all got legs about that skinny.
[1:12:37.820 --> 1:12:41.620]  And so if they try to hide and act like good old boys,
[1:12:41.620 --> 1:12:43.460]  whether they're black, white, old, young,
[1:12:43.460 --> 1:12:44.540]  they're not gonna fit in.
[1:12:44.540 --> 1:12:45.460]  They don't bathe.
[1:12:46.780 --> 1:12:49.540]  I mean, literally, we'll be able to smell the Antifa people
[1:12:49.540 --> 1:12:50.380]  if they're here.
[1:12:50.380 --> 1:12:53.620]  I mean, seriously, I don't think it's gonna work,
[1:12:53.620 --> 1:12:56.500]  but could they have somebody shoot into a crowd
[1:12:56.500 --> 1:12:58.500]  and then have responsibility taken
[1:12:58.500 --> 1:13:00.220]  by supposedly a militia or something?
[1:13:00.220 --> 1:13:02.260]  Absolutely, but none of the real militias.
[1:13:02.260 --> 1:13:03.980]  None of the real second of them, folks,
[1:13:03.980 --> 1:13:06.260]  are anti-law enforcement or anti-police.
[1:13:06.260 --> 1:13:07.660]  In fact, military police
[1:13:07.660 --> 1:13:09.860]  are some of the most awaited groups out there.
[1:13:09.860 --> 1:13:12.940]  So the idea that right-wingers and nationalist and patriots
[1:13:12.940 --> 1:13:14.580]  are coming here to kill police
[1:13:14.580 --> 1:13:17.140]  as the governor and others have had emergency press conferences
[1:13:17.140 --> 1:13:20.620]  is a total fraud, setting the way for the false flag
[1:13:20.620 --> 1:13:22.740]  or the setup when their forces do it
[1:13:22.740 --> 1:13:24.300]  or attempt it to frame us.
[1:13:24.300 --> 1:13:26.940]  But no one is buying this frame up anymore.
[1:13:26.940 --> 1:13:30.060]  Sure, the Clintons could pull their crap back in 1995
[1:13:30.060 --> 1:13:33.500]  and frame patriots, but that dog doesn't hunt today, David.
[1:13:33.500 --> 1:13:35.940]  Well, you know, Alex, the Antifa Seven Hills,
[1:13:35.940 --> 1:13:37.740]  they were the ones that were interviewed by Vice
[1:13:37.740 --> 1:13:39.580]  and they said, look, they're reasonable people
[1:13:39.580 --> 1:13:41.660]  and they just, you know, they wanna make common cause here
[1:13:41.660 --> 1:13:43.940]  and they're against these gun control laws
[1:13:43.940 --> 1:13:45.580]  and the past have been racist.
[1:13:45.580 --> 1:13:47.900]  And yet, you know, we've got the list here
[1:13:47.900 --> 1:13:50.620]  of that same group putting our reporters out
[1:13:50.620 --> 1:13:52.580]  as known fascists and sympathizers.
[1:13:52.580 --> 1:13:55.020]  But the other aspect of this, Alex,
[1:13:55.020 --> 1:13:58.380]  is the people who are the real rabble-rousers
[1:13:58.380 --> 1:14:00.540]  who are really out there making
[1:14:00.540 --> 1:14:03.060]  terroristic types of statements
[1:14:03.060 --> 1:14:05.860]  are the suits in the Democrat party.
[1:14:05.860 --> 1:14:08.740]  People like Eric Swalwell, people like Beto O'Rourke,
[1:14:08.740 --> 1:14:13.540]  people like Mark Levine, who is a Virginia delegate.
[1:14:13.540 --> 1:14:14.740]  I've got a tweet here from him.
[1:14:14.740 --> 1:14:16.700]  This is a guy who, you know, there's this picture,
[1:14:16.700 --> 1:14:18.700]  he's got a suit on, he's a Harvard,
[1:14:18.700 --> 1:14:21.140]  he's a Yale graduate from both those places.
[1:14:21.140 --> 1:14:23.860]  And he says this, the muskets of our founding fathers
[1:14:23.860 --> 1:14:26.260]  also did not contain 30 bullet magazines.
[1:14:26.260 --> 1:14:28.740]  And if you think your AR-15 will do diddly
[1:14:28.740 --> 1:14:31.460]  against the full might and power of the US military,
[1:14:31.460 --> 1:14:33.860]  you need to talk to somebody who has served there.
[1:14:33.860 --> 1:14:35.300]  Again, making a threat.
[1:14:35.300 --> 1:14:37.220]  That's like Swalwell, Swalwell, Swalwell.
[1:14:37.220 --> 1:14:38.620]  Exactly.
[1:14:38.620 --> 1:14:40.580]  Swalwell's saying he'll use nuclear weapons
[1:14:40.580 --> 1:14:41.540]  on American gun owners.
[1:14:41.540 --> 1:14:44.220]  Talking about a Hitlerian or Stalinistic tyrant
[1:14:44.220 --> 1:14:45.700]  on steroids, you're absolutely right.
[1:14:45.700 --> 1:14:47.620]  So when we come back, there's a lot of patriots
[1:14:47.620 --> 1:14:49.340]  already out here at night.
[1:14:49.340 --> 1:14:51.260]  And so I think we should probably just bring them up
[1:14:51.260 --> 1:14:53.820]  to this hot Mike Uncensored and get what some
[1:14:53.820 --> 1:14:55.620]  of the folks think and if they disagree with us,
[1:14:55.620 --> 1:14:56.900]  we'll put them on air as well.
[1:14:56.900 --> 1:14:59.220]  So this is David Knight hosting the Alex Jones show.
[1:14:59.220 --> 1:15:00.660]  I'm gonna do a few more segments here live
[1:15:00.660 --> 1:15:02.220]  with David, he's got more coming up.
[1:15:02.220 --> 1:15:04.060]  Then tomorrow morning, he'll have a guest host
[1:15:04.060 --> 1:15:06.220]  hosting his show, he'll be hosting my main show
[1:15:06.220 --> 1:15:08.060]  from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central,
[1:15:08.060 --> 1:15:09.620]  and the war room from the ground,
[1:15:09.620 --> 1:15:10.780]  and we're gonna continue on.
[1:15:10.780 --> 1:15:13.460]  And then the trial in the Senate of the president, David,
[1:15:13.460 --> 1:15:14.660]  this is a crazy time.
[1:15:14.660 --> 1:15:15.900]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[1:15:15.900 --> 1:15:19.340]  And the craziest people seem to be the ones wearing the suits
[1:15:19.340 --> 1:15:22.180]  because they're the ones making the most incendiary statements
[1:15:22.180 --> 1:15:24.820]  and threatening the violence of the military
[1:15:24.820 --> 1:15:27.660]  against people who are using their constitutional rights
[1:15:27.660 --> 1:15:31.260]  to redress their grievances as we have the Democrats
[1:15:31.260 --> 1:15:34.540]  on the offense trying to take away
[1:15:34.540 --> 1:15:36.020]  protections of individual rights
[1:15:36.020 --> 1:15:37.180]  that have been in place for centuries.
[1:15:37.180 --> 1:15:39.020]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[1:15:39.020 --> 1:15:56.940]  It's time to take a new healthier approach
[1:15:56.940 --> 1:15:58.780]  to one of your most basic needs.
[1:15:58.780 --> 1:16:00.820]  The Alexa Pure Pro Water Filtration System
[1:16:00.820 --> 1:16:03.460]  is the same water filter that Alex and the Infowars crew
[1:16:03.460 --> 1:16:05.820]  use every day for the purest water possible.
[1:16:05.820 --> 1:16:07.580]  You can start cleaning the toxins from your water

[1:16:09.780 --> 1:16:11.460]  Perfect for preppers or anyone concerned
[1:16:11.460 --> 1:16:12.980]  with the healthier source of water,
[1:16:12.980 --> 1:16:16.780]  the Alexa Pure Pro can remove up to 99.9% of impurities.
[1:16:16.780 --> 1:16:19.420]  This groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system
[1:16:19.420 --> 1:16:21.060]  is like no other.
[1:16:21.060 --> 1:16:23.020]  Make sure your water is up to your standards today
[1:16:23.020 --> 1:16:24.300]  with the Alexa Pure Pro.
[1:16:25.460 --> 1:16:28.340]  As impeachment, war, and natural disaster threats
[1:16:28.340 --> 1:16:30.060]  loom over the American people,
[1:16:30.060 --> 1:16:32.380]  it's more important than ever to stay ready.
[1:16:32.380 --> 1:16:34.020]  Yet most people fail to act
[1:16:34.020 --> 1:16:36.060]  until after an emergency is already hit.
[1:16:36.060 --> 1:16:37.820]  This year, the Infowars store is ready
[1:16:37.820 --> 1:16:39.540]  to help you face what comes next

[1:16:49.380 --> 1:16:50.780]  We're giving you up to 50% off
[1:16:50.780 --> 1:16:54.460]  to make sure that you can truly build your preparedness base.
[1:16:54.460 --> 1:16:56.500]  If you understand why the globalist,
[1:16:56.500 --> 1:16:59.020]  why the servants of Satan hate Infowars,
[1:16:59.020 --> 1:17:03.540]  it's because we're awake, we're alive, we're passionate,
[1:17:03.540 --> 1:17:06.140]  and we're not giving up.
[1:17:06.140 --> 1:17:07.980]  That's why it's critical for those of us
[1:17:07.980 --> 1:17:11.020]  that are aware of the New World Order's plans
[1:17:11.020 --> 1:17:13.100]  to not get down when they attack us,
[1:17:13.100 --> 1:17:15.620]  and they persecute us, and they lie about us.
[1:17:15.620 --> 1:17:17.260]  That's what we should expect
[1:17:17.260 --> 1:17:20.180]  because we are hurting these scumbags.
[1:17:20.180 --> 1:17:22.420]  The globalists have literally sold their souls
[1:17:22.420 --> 1:17:24.380]  to the dark side, and they do what they do
[1:17:24.380 --> 1:17:28.020]  because they're slaves, because they are eternally driven
[1:17:28.020 --> 1:17:31.620]  to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent.
[1:17:31.620 --> 1:17:33.740]  It is up to us who are awake,
[1:17:33.740 --> 1:17:35.980]  not the sheep and not the wolves,
[1:17:35.980 --> 1:17:39.060]  but the sheepdogs to stand firm
[1:17:39.060 --> 1:17:41.580]  and resist these wicked tyrants.
[1:17:41.580 --> 1:17:44.340]  They fear the fact that we are awake.
[1:17:44.340 --> 1:17:46.900]  They fear the fact that we are alive.
[1:17:46.900 --> 1:17:49.980]  They fear the fact that we love God,
[1:17:49.980 --> 1:17:52.100]  and that's all we ever have to know
[1:17:52.100 --> 1:17:53.900]  is that God is in charge.
[1:17:55.580 --> 1:17:59.140]  I spend a lot of time reminding the Infowars
[1:17:59.140 --> 1:18:02.620]  family of listeners and viewers that
[1:18:02.620 --> 1:18:04.300]  without you we won't be on the air,
[1:18:04.300 --> 1:18:06.300]  and I spend a lot of time thanking you.
[1:18:06.300 --> 1:18:08.300]  But I really think you should thank yourself
[1:18:08.300 --> 1:18:11.060]  for keeping us on the air and really changing the world
[1:18:11.060 --> 1:18:12.540]  for the better and raising the alarm
[1:18:12.540 --> 1:18:13.660]  as modern ball reveres.
[1:18:13.660 --> 1:18:15.980]  But something I should spend more time on
[1:18:15.980 --> 1:18:19.580]  is just reminding you that these products
[1:18:19.580 --> 1:18:21.140]  are really amazing.
[1:18:21.140 --> 1:18:22.540]  You've got that pledge from me,
[1:18:22.540 --> 1:18:24.340]  but you've seen the third-party test out there,
[1:18:24.340 --> 1:18:26.380]  the air filtration, the water filtration.
[1:18:26.380 --> 1:18:28.740]  The supplements are all the very best
[1:18:28.740 --> 1:18:29.860]  you're going to find out there.
[1:18:29.860 --> 1:18:33.180]  And you can't fund an operation anywhere else
[1:18:33.180 --> 1:18:35.980]  that's fighting the globalist this hard.
[1:18:35.980 --> 1:18:39.860]  So it's not a burden to support Infowars.
[1:18:39.860 --> 1:18:44.660]  It really is something that is good for everybody
[1:18:44.660 --> 1:18:46.620]  that stands for justice and freedom
[1:18:46.620 --> 1:18:48.860]  and makes your life and your family's life
[1:18:48.860 --> 1:18:50.540]  and your children's life so much better.
[1:18:50.540 --> 1:18:53.460]  So visit InfowarsStore.com today.
[1:18:53.460 --> 1:18:56.460]  It's Friday and I'm driving to the airport right now,
[1:18:56.460 --> 1:19:01.460]  late to catch the plane to get to Virginia and D.C.
[1:19:01.460 --> 1:19:05.460]  to cover how the left's trying to trigger a civil war
[1:19:05.460 --> 1:19:07.460]  at the very same time that they have scheduled
[1:19:07.460 --> 1:19:09.460]  this trial in the Senate.
[1:19:09.460 --> 1:19:11.460]  And they even admit they're hoping now
[1:19:11.460 --> 1:19:13.460]  a bunch of violence to embarrass America,
[1:19:13.460 --> 1:19:15.460]  embarrass the president and pull this crap.
[1:19:15.460 --> 1:19:17.460]  And the average person totally gets it.
[1:19:17.460 --> 1:19:19.460]  So that's why even if they pull off some violence,
[1:19:19.460 --> 1:19:21.460]  which we hope it doesn't happen,
[1:19:21.460 --> 1:19:23.460]  people aren't gonna buy it.
[1:19:23.460 --> 1:19:25.460]  Just like they didn't buy the cabin off-fraud
[1:19:25.460 --> 1:19:26.460]  that he's raping all these women
[1:19:26.460 --> 1:19:28.460]  and that all turned out to be lies,
[1:19:28.460 --> 1:19:30.460]  run by the CIA and just like all the other stuff
[1:19:30.460 --> 1:19:32.460]  they pull, Charlottesville, all of it,
[1:19:32.460 --> 1:19:34.460]  it's not working, the people are awake.
[1:19:34.460 --> 1:19:37.460]  But one thing that is the linchpin
[1:19:37.460 --> 1:19:39.460]  is money to fund the reporters, the crew,
[1:19:39.460 --> 1:19:42.460]  the bandwidth, the research, the airplane tickets,
[1:19:42.460 --> 1:19:43.460]  everything.
[1:19:43.460 --> 1:19:44.460]  And that's InfowarsStore.com.
[1:19:44.460 --> 1:19:46.460]  So buying the products are great
[1:19:46.460 --> 1:19:48.460]  because you'll enjoy them, they're really good products,
[1:19:48.460 --> 1:19:49.460]  but it's also a one-off.
[1:19:49.460 --> 1:19:51.460]  InfowarsStore.com, take action now.
[1:20:20.460 --> 1:20:22.460]  I just want to ask you a question.
[1:20:22.460 --> 1:20:23.460]  This is a rhetorical question.
[1:20:23.460 --> 1:20:26.460]  Who is it that is rebelling against the Constitution
[1:20:26.460 --> 1:20:27.460]  they swore to uphold?
[1:20:27.460 --> 1:20:29.460]  It's the Democrat suits, isn't it?
[1:20:29.460 --> 1:20:32.460]  Who's out there making incendiary statements
[1:20:32.460 --> 1:20:34.460]  and threatening mass violence?
[1:20:34.460 --> 1:20:36.460]  Those same Democrat suits.
[1:20:36.460 --> 1:20:39.460]  Who is on the offense, the Democrat suits?
[1:20:39.460 --> 1:20:41.460]  And who is on the defense?
[1:20:41.460 --> 1:20:43.460]  Well, we've got Alex Jones in Richmond, Virginia,
[1:20:43.460 --> 1:20:45.460]  and he's standing there with a lot of people
[1:20:45.460 --> 1:20:48.460]  who are there to peacefully redress their grievances,
[1:20:48.460 --> 1:20:50.460]  and he's going to talk to them and get their opinions.
[1:20:50.460 --> 1:20:53.460]  And, of course, they want to exercise their free speech
[1:20:53.460 --> 1:20:55.460]  to protect their other rights.
[1:20:55.460 --> 1:20:58.460]  And we have everything being done by the Democrats
[1:20:58.460 --> 1:21:02.460]  and the mainstream media to try to frighten them off,
[1:21:02.460 --> 1:21:04.460]  to threaten them in every possible way.
[1:21:04.460 --> 1:21:08.460]  So in Virginia, in front of the state capitol there in Richmond
[1:21:08.460 --> 1:21:11.460]  is Alex Jones with many people who have shown up
[1:21:11.460 --> 1:21:13.460]  to protect their rights.
[1:21:13.460 --> 1:21:14.460]  Alex?
[1:21:13.460 --> 1:21:15.460]  That's right, David. That's right.
[1:21:15.460 --> 1:21:17.460]  And they can't hear you, so I'm just going to ask the question again.
[1:21:17.460 --> 1:21:18.460]  Who is it?
[1:21:18.460 --> 1:21:21.460]  Is the Democrat suit calling for civil emergencies
[1:21:21.460 --> 1:21:23.460]  and going to be war?
[1:21:23.460 --> 1:21:25.460]  And so, or is it the people?
[1:21:25.460 --> 1:21:27.460]  We're here in defense of freedom.
[1:21:27.460 --> 1:21:30.460]  They're the ones openly violating their oaths to Constitution.
[1:21:30.460 --> 1:21:33.460]  So I want to go through and ask all you guys and gals
[1:21:33.460 --> 1:21:35.460]  why you're here and why you're doing this
[1:21:35.460 --> 1:21:37.460]  and what you think about what's happening here.
[1:21:37.460 --> 1:21:38.460]  Ma'am, what's your name? Where are you from?
[1:21:38.460 --> 1:21:40.460]  My name's Amy Straub. I'm a Democrat.
[1:21:40.460 --> 1:21:42.460]  That's awesome. What's your view on all this?
[1:21:42.460 --> 1:21:49.460]  I'm talking about law as part of a process to control part of a band
[1:21:49.460 --> 1:21:51.460]  and they're really liberties.
[1:21:51.460 --> 1:21:54.460]  It's going into straight tyranny.
[1:21:54.460 --> 1:21:55.460]  We're not...
[1:21:55.460 --> 1:21:57.460]  You just suddenly, Democrats take over.
[1:21:57.460 --> 1:21:59.460]  We're confiscating your guns?
[1:21:59.460 --> 1:22:01.460]  And they said everything. They're just going to take the bullets, they're going to...
[1:22:01.460 --> 1:22:04.460]  They took out 20 years in this man with the minor party.
[1:22:04.460 --> 1:22:08.460]  20 years, right?
[1:22:08.460 --> 1:22:09.460]  The minute they got in?
[1:22:09.460 --> 1:22:11.460]  The minute they got in.
[1:22:11.460 --> 1:22:19.940]  The 16th bill to go in with his all right. Well, thanks for talking to us. I hope tomorrow is going to be peaceful
[1:22:19.940 --> 1:22:21.940]  I know we're going to be peaceful aren't we?
[1:22:21.940 --> 1:22:23.940]  Sir, tell us who you are.
[1:22:23.940 --> 1:22:25.940]  My name is Rick Daren, I'm here.
[1:22:25.940 --> 1:22:27.940]  My name is Richmond.
[1:22:27.940 --> 1:22:37.140]  So, you know what she said, make it short. No, we're not going to take this, we're not going to have it.
[1:22:37.140 --> 1:22:39.140]  What's going on here?
[1:22:39.140 --> 1:22:43.860]  And again, for TV viewers, I didn't bring out my stick mic. I've got my ear buds hit another
[1:22:43.860 --> 1:22:47.460]  about her even at night the day before. So, I've got to get closer. They can't hear me. So, I'm not
[1:22:47.460 --> 1:22:50.980]  trying to get your space. Love you, brother. You're awesome. Sir, why are you? What's your name?
[1:22:50.980 --> 1:22:52.980]  State back in the North Carolina.
[1:22:52.980 --> 1:23:00.660]  Before that, I make four notes to the whole stuff. And that goes to the great. It doesn't go when you
[1:23:00.660 --> 1:23:07.780]  get out of school. Dude, that if I did come here and like this and stand this for this here in Virginia,
[1:23:07.780 --> 1:23:10.820]  then I'm going to be fighting it in North Carolina.
[1:23:10.820 --> 1:23:15.780]  And again, we're not, you know, we're kind of ragtag here with our crew, which is bigger than its mainstream
[1:23:15.780 --> 1:23:20.900]  media. And I heard the mainstream media was playing some games earlier. Sir, tell us what you witnessed
[1:23:20.900 --> 1:23:22.900]  and where are they going?
[1:23:22.900 --> 1:23:30.740]  This is absolutely asinine. They don't understand our own great product. And at least there's that
[1:23:30.740 --> 1:23:32.740]  the Commonwealth feel every day.
[1:23:32.740 --> 1:23:34.740]  And tell folks what that means in Latin.
[1:23:34.740 --> 1:23:36.740]  That's always the other word.
[1:23:36.740 --> 1:23:38.740]  That's the difference.
[1:23:38.740 --> 1:23:44.740]  That's us, us people, us Americans, us Indians are fed up with this. And we're going to do everything we can
[1:23:44.740 --> 1:23:46.740]  to take back our state.
[1:23:46.740 --> 1:23:50.740]  Exactly. They can go to the North Korea or China or anywhere where everybody's just armed.
[1:23:50.740 --> 1:23:54.740]  When the seal of the state says we're going to destroy pirates, what do they think they're doing?
[1:24:00.740 --> 1:24:04.740]  Why do you think they're so so arrogant and did it right away?
[1:24:04.740 --> 1:24:06.740]  Honestly, I don't know.
[1:24:06.740 --> 1:24:14.740]  It's talking about Soros and Bloomberg. And because they want our country and they want the southern
[1:24:14.740 --> 1:24:16.740]  majority, well, we're done being sound.
[1:24:16.740 --> 1:24:20.740]  That's right. And they want Anthony and others to be able to bully us and not have us armed.
[1:24:20.740 --> 1:24:22.740]  But it's not that.
[1:24:22.740 --> 1:24:24.740]  And Soros is buying off all the attorneys. God bless you, brother.
[1:24:24.740 --> 1:24:28.740]  And again, give them the state motto in Latin and translate it one more time because that's powerful.
[1:24:28.740 --> 1:24:34.740]  Yeah. And translate it like what the English that means. What does that mean to you?
[1:24:34.740 --> 1:24:40.740]  It means what our state flag is that you have a, you have 20 warriors.
[1:24:40.740 --> 1:24:54.740]  And we're the Amazonians. So it's our job now is to pick up and stop.
[1:24:54.740 --> 1:24:56.740]  Absolutely beautiful, brother. Thank you.
[1:24:56.740 --> 1:25:00.740]  What's your name?
[1:25:00.740 --> 1:25:02.740]  What do you make of this?
[1:25:02.740 --> 1:25:04.740]  It's the first step.
[1:25:04.740 --> 1:25:06.740]  What they're trying to do.
[1:25:06.740 --> 1:25:08.740]  Yes.
[1:25:08.740 --> 1:25:10.740]  They're chipping away at our liberties day by day.
[1:25:10.740 --> 1:25:16.740]  Well, every day, there's, there's round the clock.
[1:25:16.740 --> 1:25:28.740]  You're right.
[1:25:28.740 --> 1:25:30.740]  Thanks for being here and standing up for Virginia.
[1:25:30.740 --> 1:25:32.740]  Look, I love Virginia's everybody else.
[1:25:32.740 --> 1:25:34.740]  I'm sad for my family and all of our rides.
[1:25:34.740 --> 1:25:36.740]  We're all in this together.
[1:25:36.740 --> 1:25:38.740]  Join or die. That's the whole point.
[1:25:38.740 --> 1:25:40.740]  They're coming for all our freedoms.
[1:25:40.740 --> 1:25:44.740]  Like you said, this is a big beta death and a big fat gopher at all and see if we'll take it.
[1:25:44.740 --> 1:25:54.740]  And all I gotta say.
[1:25:54.740 --> 1:25:56.740]  Absolutely death and tyrants.
[1:25:56.740 --> 1:25:58.740]  And we don't want any violence tomorrow.
[1:25:58.740 --> 1:26:00.740]  We're seeing death to their tyranny.
[1:26:00.740 --> 1:26:04.740]  If they come after us, they try to take our guns as an iron is tyrant.
[1:26:04.740 --> 1:26:08.740]  You guys want to jump in here and give us a line or brother where you from?
[1:26:08.740 --> 1:26:10.740]  What's your name?
[1:26:10.740 --> 1:26:12.740]  So what's your take on what's happening while you're here?
[1:26:12.740 --> 1:26:14.740]  We're going towards a one world.
[1:26:14.740 --> 1:26:18.740]  It's all happening from a biblical standpoint.
[1:26:18.740 --> 1:26:20.740]  I won't get too deeply into it.
[1:26:20.740 --> 1:26:26.740]  I mean, all we can do is stand up and and not take it sitting down.
[1:26:26.740 --> 1:26:28.740]  That's the test.
[1:26:28.740 --> 1:26:30.740]  Yes, sir.
[1:26:30.740 --> 1:26:32.740]  God bless you, brother.
[1:26:32.740 --> 1:26:34.740]  Why are you here, sir? What's your name? Patrick.
[1:26:34.740 --> 1:26:36.740]  I'm from that county, Virginia.
[1:26:36.740 --> 1:26:38.740]  Fantastic. What do you make of that?
[1:26:38.740 --> 1:26:42.740]  It's the law.
[1:26:42.740 --> 1:26:44.740]  And they think that they can get away with it.
[1:26:44.740 --> 1:26:48.740]  But we're waking up and we're seeing their lives.
[1:26:48.740 --> 1:26:52.740]  And we got a guy who wants to openly advocate for babies.
[1:26:52.740 --> 1:26:54.740]  Keep them comfortable.
[1:26:54.740 --> 1:26:56.740]  And you're right.
[1:26:56.740 --> 1:26:58.740]  Oregon Soros have bought hundreds of sheriffs,
[1:26:58.740 --> 1:27:00.740]  hundreds of district attorneys,
[1:27:00.740 --> 1:27:02.740]  and hundreds of state legislators and they're bragging
[1:27:02.740 --> 1:27:06.740]  that we're just going to buy up all the politicians.
[1:27:06.740 --> 1:27:10.740]  All of them are county attorneys being pursued.
[1:27:10.740 --> 1:27:12.740]  Our township attorneys.
[1:27:12.740 --> 1:27:14.740]  Bloomberg's got a separate organization going after them,
[1:27:14.740 --> 1:27:16.740]  who sits next to the board of supervisors.
[1:27:16.740 --> 1:27:18.740]  And those board of supervisors are having their meeting.
[1:27:18.740 --> 1:27:20.740]  They'll lean over and they'll ask this guy's opinion.
[1:27:20.740 --> 1:27:24.740]  That gets swayed towards the top.
[1:27:24.740 --> 1:27:26.740]  So they're off of you down here bullying everybody.
[1:27:26.740 --> 1:27:28.740]  That's right.
[1:27:28.740 --> 1:27:30.740]  Literal. I forget.
[1:27:30.740 --> 1:27:32.740]  By the way, Bloomberg's hated anybody across the country.
[1:27:32.740 --> 1:27:34.740]  I was in New York.
[1:27:34.740 --> 1:27:36.740]  We're going to go to break here in a few minutes.
[1:27:36.740 --> 1:27:38.740]  Audio good back there at the headquarters.
[1:27:38.740 --> 1:27:40.740]  Yeah, we can hear you fine.
[1:27:40.740 --> 1:27:42.740]  It's dropping off a lot when you get off center
[1:27:42.740 --> 1:27:44.740]  with the other people.
[1:27:44.740 --> 1:27:46.740]  Tomorrow we'll have a stick microphone out here.
[1:27:46.740 --> 1:27:48.740]  But stuff's going well and it's amazing.
[1:27:48.740 --> 1:27:50.740]  Ma'am, come on over here and tell us where you're from.
[1:27:50.740 --> 1:27:52.740]  Oh, hi.
[1:27:52.740 --> 1:27:54.740]  I'm Erica Jones.
[1:27:54.740 --> 1:27:56.740]  I'm from Omaha, Nebraska.
[1:27:56.740 --> 1:27:58.740]  To me, it's a human rights issue.
[1:27:58.740 --> 1:28:00.740]  Once we're right to defend ourselves,
[1:28:00.740 --> 1:28:02.740]  they dehumanize us.
[1:28:02.740 --> 1:28:04.740]  And it is the first step
[1:28:04.740 --> 1:28:06.740]  to taking over
[1:28:06.740 --> 1:28:08.740]  and ridding humanity.
[1:28:08.740 --> 1:28:10.740]  Actually.
[1:28:10.740 --> 1:28:12.740]  Right to self-defense.
[1:28:12.740 --> 1:28:14.740]  Absolutely.
[1:28:14.740 --> 1:28:16.740]  It took the guns.
[1:28:16.740 --> 1:28:18.740]  Hitler took the guns.
[1:28:18.740 --> 1:28:20.740]  Stalin took the guns.
[1:28:20.740 --> 1:28:22.740]  Mal took the guns.
[1:28:22.740 --> 1:28:24.740]  And if you try to take our firearms,
[1:28:24.740 --> 1:28:26.740]  1776 will commence again.
[1:28:26.740 --> 1:28:28.740]  I don't know who said that.
[1:28:28.740 --> 1:28:30.740]  Are they going to take our guns?
[1:28:30.740 --> 1:28:32.740]  Are they going to take our free speech?
[1:28:32.740 --> 1:28:34.740]  Are we slaints of the Charcot funding lovers?
[1:28:34.740 --> 1:28:36.740]  Are we slaints of this art media?
[1:28:36.740 --> 1:28:38.740]  No, America's awake
[1:28:38.740 --> 1:28:40.740]  and it's rising.
[1:28:40.740 --> 1:28:42.740]  And the globalists are failing.
[1:28:42.740 --> 1:28:44.740]  All right, we'll be right back.
[1:28:44.740 --> 1:28:46.740]  Stay with us.
[1:28:46.740 --> 1:28:48.740]  And remember, we had on the Come and Take It flag a cannon.
[1:28:48.740 --> 1:29:00.740]  We have a new product and we got several thousand of these in.
[1:29:00.740 --> 1:29:02.740]  And they're going to sell out in a few days at the rate we're selling them.
[1:29:02.740 --> 1:29:04.740]  I want to thank the listeners for getting it.
[1:29:04.740 --> 1:29:06.740]  But this really is a game-changing toothpaste.
[1:29:06.740 --> 1:29:08.740]  And it doesn't compete
[1:29:08.740 --> 1:29:12.740]  with super blue that's four to five of colloidal silver and iodine and fluoride free.
[1:29:12.740 --> 1:29:14.740]  The adult or the children's.
[1:29:14.740 --> 1:29:16.740]  These are both excellent toothpaste.
[1:29:16.740 --> 1:29:18.740]  Concentrates that don't have fillers.
[1:29:18.740 --> 1:29:20.740]  People love it.
[1:29:20.740 --> 1:29:22.740]  This is a whitening toothpaste
[1:29:22.740 --> 1:29:24.740]  that also has the above sea coral calcium
[1:29:24.740 --> 1:29:26.740]  that also cleans but also
[1:29:26.740 --> 1:29:28.740]  re-mineralizes the teeth.
[1:29:28.740 --> 1:29:30.740]  Then it has the patented silver
[1:29:30.740 --> 1:29:32.740]  silver in it to knock out the bacteria
[1:29:32.740 --> 1:29:34.740]  that causes ginsivitis.
[1:29:34.740 --> 1:29:36.740]  This is all proven. You can make claims with this.
[1:29:36.740 --> 1:29:38.740]  But I had to tell you, no one has a toothpaste this good
[1:29:38.740 --> 1:29:40.740]  for knocking out the bacteria,
[1:29:40.740 --> 1:29:42.740]  the viruses,
[1:29:42.740 --> 1:29:44.740]  and cleaning the teeth in a healthy way
[1:29:44.740 --> 1:29:46.740]  that doesn't strip away the enamel.
[1:29:46.740 --> 1:29:48.740]  So we're really proud of it.
[1:29:48.740 --> 1:29:50.740]  It funds the operation infowarstore.com.
[1:29:50.740 --> 1:30:16.740]  That's why we're still on air. Thanks to you.
[1:30:20.740 --> 1:30:22.740]  Thank you.
[1:30:50.740 --> 1:30:52.740]  25 years ago
[1:30:52.740 --> 1:30:54.740]  when I first began broadcasting
[1:30:54.740 --> 1:30:56.740]  I was a realist and I was honest
[1:30:56.740 --> 1:30:58.740]  with the listeners.
[1:30:58.740 --> 1:31:00.740]  America was in a coma.
[1:31:00.740 --> 1:31:02.740]  We were being absolutely poisoned
[1:31:02.740 --> 1:31:04.740]  physically, culturally, and spiritually.
[1:31:04.740 --> 1:31:06.740]  The New World Order
[1:31:06.740 --> 1:31:08.740]  was running rampant
[1:31:08.740 --> 1:31:10.740]  because the public was asleep.
[1:31:10.740 --> 1:31:12.740]  Fast forward to this year
[1:31:12.740 --> 1:31:14.740]  in 2020
[1:31:14.740 --> 1:31:16.740]  and to see the Soros
[1:31:16.740 --> 1:31:18.740]  spend over $100 million
[1:31:18.740 --> 1:31:20.740]  on the women's march
[1:31:20.740 --> 1:31:22.740]  here in D.C. and in Los Angeles.
[1:31:22.740 --> 1:31:24.740]  And they might have had 30,000 people.
[1:31:24.740 --> 1:31:26.740]  Maybe.
[1:31:26.740 --> 1:31:28.740]  They had 5 million 3 years ago.
[1:31:28.740 --> 1:31:30.740]  Ladies and gentlemen, I was here.
[1:31:30.740 --> 1:31:32.740]  That is emblematic of how his money
[1:31:32.740 --> 1:31:34.740]  and Chico money
[1:31:34.740 --> 1:31:36.740]  cannot buy them the
[1:31:36.740 --> 1:31:38.740]  AstroTurf anymore.
[1:31:38.740 --> 1:31:40.740]  So yes, the awakenings happened,
[1:31:40.740 --> 1:31:42.740]  but we're not out of the woods.
[1:31:42.740 --> 1:31:44.740]  The globalists are going to throw a bunch of Hail Marys
[1:31:44.740 --> 1:31:46.740]  during this Trump Senate trial
[1:31:46.740 --> 1:31:48.740]  and we're going to be covering it live
[1:31:48.740 --> 1:31:50.740]  from D.C. and ban.video.
[1:31:50.740 --> 1:32:19.740]  Please be Paul Revere and share this link.
[1:32:20.740 --> 1:32:22.740]  Thank you so much for joining me.
[1:32:51.740 --> 1:32:53.740]  We're fighting to win and we are winning.
[1:32:53.740 --> 1:33:22.740]  Thanks to you.
[1:33:23.740 --> 1:33:25.740]  Welcome back.
[1:33:25.740 --> 1:33:27.740]  This is David Knight of the studio here in Austin.
[1:33:27.740 --> 1:33:29.740]  We have Alex Jones at the Capitol
[1:33:29.740 --> 1:33:31.740]  in Virginia right there in Richmond
[1:33:31.740 --> 1:33:33.740]  in front of the state Capitol.
[1:33:33.740 --> 1:33:35.740]  He was just talking to a lot of people
[1:33:35.740 --> 1:33:37.740]  who were there to peacefully redress
[1:33:37.740 --> 1:33:39.740]  their grievances to defend as that last lady
[1:33:39.740 --> 1:33:41.740]  said their human rights
[1:33:41.740 --> 1:33:43.740]  and they're being portrayed
[1:33:43.740 --> 1:33:45.740]  as radical, as dangerous,
[1:33:45.740 --> 1:33:47.740]  as a presenting a state of emergency.
[1:33:47.740 --> 1:33:49.740]  Nothing could be further
[1:33:49.740 --> 1:33:51.740]  from the truth.
[1:33:51.740 --> 1:33:53.740]  We'll go back to Alex.
[1:33:53.740 --> 1:33:55.740]  Alex, what else do you see there
[1:33:55.740 --> 1:33:57.740]  at the Capitol?
[1:33:57.740 --> 1:33:59.740]  Well, again, it's
[1:33:59.740 --> 1:34:01.740]  something right out of
[1:34:01.740 --> 1:34:03.740]  pre-Civil War iconography
[1:34:03.740 --> 1:34:05.740]  as TV viewers can see it.
[1:34:05.740 --> 1:34:07.740]  There's a little like a Capitol,
[1:34:07.740 --> 1:34:09.740]  like the U.S. Capitol.
[1:34:09.740 --> 1:34:11.740]  It looks more like the White House
[1:34:11.740 --> 1:34:13.740]  or a big Greek monument,
[1:34:13.740 --> 1:34:15.740]  but when you really think about how
[1:34:15.740 --> 1:34:17.740]  they denied they wanted to confiscate our guns,
[1:34:17.740 --> 1:34:19.740]  despite the fact in all these other countries
[1:34:19.740 --> 1:34:21.740]  they've taken the guns.
[1:34:21.740 --> 1:34:23.740]  But now they've gone to hell yes,
[1:34:23.740 --> 1:34:25.740]  we want to take your guns,
[1:34:25.740 --> 1:34:27.740]  because they want to then paint everybody
[1:34:27.740 --> 1:34:29.740]  that's pro-gun and some have a terrorist
[1:34:29.740 --> 1:34:31.740]  and then have the media say we're terrorists
[1:34:31.740 --> 1:34:33.740]  hoping some violence happens.
[1:34:33.740 --> 1:34:35.740]  I know I keep repeating all of this,
[1:34:35.740 --> 1:34:37.740]  but you can see how this is the day before
[1:34:37.740 --> 1:34:39.740]  Trump is going to be
[1:34:39.740 --> 1:34:41.740]  in trial.
[1:34:41.740 --> 1:34:43.740]  Who is an American patriot president,
[1:34:43.740 --> 1:34:45.740]  not perfect, but anti-globalist
[1:34:45.740 --> 1:34:47.740]  and the system is pissed.
[1:34:47.740 --> 1:34:49.740]  You've got the establishment
[1:34:49.740 --> 1:34:51.740]  controlled media
[1:34:51.740 --> 1:34:53.740]  over here that just gets at Southern Primary
[1:34:53.740 --> 1:34:55.740]  Law Center talking points,
[1:34:55.740 --> 1:34:57.740]  again, Hollywood's owned by the Chi Coms,
[1:34:57.740 --> 1:34:59.740]  the big foreign mega-makes, almost the media,
[1:34:59.740 --> 1:35:01.740]  and they just churn
[1:35:01.740 --> 1:35:03.740]  anti-American establishment bilge
[1:35:03.740 --> 1:35:05.740]  because the big corporations have captured the rest of the world.
[1:35:05.740 --> 1:35:07.740]  They've taken the guns everywhere else
[1:35:07.740 --> 1:35:09.740]  and so they can't believe they can't take
[1:35:09.740 --> 1:35:11.740]  all the speech here, they can't take all the guns.
[1:35:11.740 --> 1:35:13.740]  So they've got to just start introducing
[1:35:13.740 --> 1:35:15.740]  the idea that hell yes, we're taking your gun.
[1:35:15.740 --> 1:35:17.740]  Hell yes, we're shutting down your shooting ranges.
[1:35:17.740 --> 1:35:19.740]  Because they know that the gun culture
[1:35:19.740 --> 1:35:21.740]  is taking hold and the average leftist
[1:35:21.740 --> 1:35:23.740]  is getting guns and waking up
[1:35:23.740 --> 1:35:25.740]  and crimes going down in areas
[1:35:25.740 --> 1:35:27.740]  where the public's armed.
[1:35:27.740 --> 1:35:29.740]  So they're in a crisis
[1:35:29.740 --> 1:35:31.740]  to get us back under their control because not everybody
[1:35:31.740 --> 1:35:33.740]  is a nine-month-old baby
[1:35:33.740 --> 1:35:35.740]  or a baby that just got born
[1:35:35.740 --> 1:35:37.740]  in a vampire like Northam who was over
[1:35:37.740 --> 1:35:39.740]  harvesting children's organs, and that's what he does.
[1:35:39.740 --> 1:35:41.740]  He's a Joseph Mengele.
[1:35:41.740 --> 1:35:43.740]  That Joseph Mengele can bully a baby
[1:35:43.740 --> 1:35:45.740]  and talk about how he severs them
[1:35:45.740 --> 1:35:47.740]  in pieces and sells their organs,
[1:35:47.740 --> 1:35:49.740]  but he can't get full-grown men and women
[1:35:49.740 --> 1:35:51.740]  whose full desire is just a monster.
[1:35:51.740 --> 1:35:53.740]  And as a minion of Bloomberg
[1:35:53.740 --> 1:35:55.740]  and Soros and others is to disarm
[1:35:55.740 --> 1:35:57.740]  the people here.
[1:35:57.740 --> 1:35:59.740]  So they set up, again,
[1:35:59.740 --> 1:36:01.740]  the checkpoint, and I guess the capitals closed right now,
[1:36:01.740 --> 1:36:03.740]  but you see it right over here,
[1:36:03.740 --> 1:36:05.740]  so that tomorrow
[1:36:07.740 --> 1:36:09.740]  folks are going to have to pass through
[1:36:09.740 --> 1:36:11.740]  the gate right up here.
[1:36:11.740 --> 1:36:13.740]  And by the way, it's been in the news,
[1:36:13.740 --> 1:36:15.740]  veterans, people with their legs and arms blown off
[1:36:15.740 --> 1:36:17.740]  with no criminal records
[1:36:17.740 --> 1:36:19.740]  are suspect because they're veterans.
[1:36:19.740 --> 1:36:21.740]  Some of them who've got, you know,
[1:36:21.740 --> 1:36:23.740]  family and the state police, you name it,
[1:36:23.740 --> 1:36:25.740]  but the state police are not the enemy.
[1:36:25.740 --> 1:36:27.740]  They're being ordered by the globalists
[1:36:27.740 --> 1:36:29.740]  to come up to say taking photos of the capitol
[1:36:29.740 --> 1:36:31.740]  is a potential terrorist act right now.
[1:36:31.740 --> 1:36:33.740]  Even though this is historic,
[1:36:33.740 --> 1:36:35.740]  the idea of exercising our speech is evil.
[1:36:35.740 --> 1:36:37.740]  So, of course, they want our speech number one
[1:36:37.740 --> 1:36:39.740]  and they want our right to self-defense.
[1:36:39.740 --> 1:36:41.740]  So they've got this emergency declaration
[1:36:41.740 --> 1:36:43.740]  that they've put in.
[1:36:43.740 --> 1:36:45.740]  First the capitol, then the capitol grounds
[1:36:45.740 --> 1:36:47.740]  that no one can have firearms.
[1:36:47.740 --> 1:36:49.740]  Again, to get you used to the idea
[1:36:49.740 --> 1:36:51.740]  of governors declaring emergencies
[1:36:51.740 --> 1:36:53.740]  and taking the guns.
[1:36:53.740 --> 1:36:55.740]  Pursuant to executive order number 49,
[1:36:55.740 --> 1:36:57.740]  2020, a state of emergency
[1:36:57.740 --> 1:36:59.740]  has been declared to exist
[1:36:59.740 --> 1:37:01.740]  from January 17th to 21st, 2020.
[1:37:01.740 --> 1:37:03.740]  So that's for four days.
[1:37:03.740 --> 1:37:05.740]  Possession of firearms and other weapons in the capitol,
[1:37:05.740 --> 1:37:07.740]  square during the process,
[1:37:07.740 --> 1:37:09.740]  other weapons in the capitol,
[1:37:09.740 --> 1:37:11.740]  square during the period of emergency is prohibited.
[1:37:11.740 --> 1:37:13.740]  All persons entering capitol,
[1:37:13.740 --> 1:37:15.740]  square during a period of emergency
[1:37:15.740 --> 1:37:17.740]  are subject to screening.
[1:37:17.740 --> 1:37:19.740]  Any person may decline to be screened
[1:37:19.740 --> 1:37:21.740]  and return to city streets.
[1:37:21.740 --> 1:37:23.740]  What's about denying your second amendment
[1:37:23.740 --> 1:37:25.740]  and denying your first amendment at the same time.
[1:37:25.740 --> 1:37:27.740]  Knives, scissors, needles, razors,
[1:37:27.740 --> 1:37:29.740]  slingshots, spring sticks and batons,
[1:37:29.740 --> 1:37:31.740]  metal knuckles, black jacks,
[1:37:31.740 --> 1:37:33.740]  nunchucks, throwing stars, knives,
[1:37:33.740 --> 1:37:35.740]  stun guns, tasers,
[1:37:35.740 --> 1:37:37.740]  shields, helmets, toy guns.
[1:37:37.740 --> 1:37:39.740]  But it's antifa and the left that...
[1:37:39.740 --> 1:37:41.740]  Yeah, toy guns. It's antifa
[1:37:41.740 --> 1:37:43.740]  and the left that come
[1:37:43.740 --> 1:37:45.740]  were there funded by Soros
[1:37:45.740 --> 1:37:47.740]  to collide into those defending the monuments
[1:37:47.740 --> 1:37:49.740]  in Charlottesville
[1:37:49.740 --> 1:37:51.740]  where they tried to demonize Trump
[1:37:51.740 --> 1:37:53.740]  and try to create a civil war then.
[1:37:53.740 --> 1:37:55.740]  And that's all they're trying to do
[1:37:55.740 --> 1:37:57.740]  again, hazardous materials,
[1:37:57.740 --> 1:37:59.740]  fireworks, torches and other flames.
[1:37:59.740 --> 1:38:01.740]  That's in case the hired KKK members,
[1:38:01.740 --> 1:38:03.740]  you know, the feds have come in.
[1:38:03.740 --> 1:38:05.740]  They got softballs
[1:38:05.740 --> 1:38:07.740]  and baseballs on that list as well.
[1:38:07.740 --> 1:38:09.740]  That's right. That's right.
[1:38:09.740 --> 1:38:11.740]  Drones, UAVs and laser pointers.
[1:38:11.740 --> 1:38:13.740]  So this...
[1:38:13.740 --> 1:38:15.740]  Give TV viewers a shot of that
[1:38:15.740 --> 1:38:17.740]  because this is what we're dealing with
[1:38:17.740 --> 1:38:19.740]  and this is the idea
[1:38:19.740 --> 1:38:21.740]  that we can't even have softballs.
[1:38:21.740 --> 1:38:23.740]  We can't even have baseballs, softballs,
[1:38:23.740 --> 1:38:25.740]  anything.
[1:38:25.740 --> 1:38:27.740]  Well, it's a FEMA camp, right?
[1:38:27.740 --> 1:38:29.740]  It's a FEMA camp.
[1:38:29.740 --> 1:38:31.740]  They've turned the state capital into a FEMA camp
[1:38:31.740 --> 1:38:33.740]  and they make the rules
[1:38:33.740 --> 1:38:35.740]  and they can be as arbitrary as they want.
[1:38:35.740 --> 1:38:37.740]  They can outlaw baseballs, softballs.
[1:38:37.740 --> 1:38:39.740]  David Knight is totally right.
[1:38:39.740 --> 1:38:41.740]  Totally right for the folks from other streams.
[1:38:41.740 --> 1:38:43.740]  The host hosting things back in Austin,
[1:38:43.740 --> 1:38:45.740]  Ripple Wars, David Knight just said,
[1:38:45.740 --> 1:38:47.740]  they turned us into a giant open-air FEMA camp
[1:38:47.740 --> 1:38:49.740]  and we joke around, but when
[1:38:49.740 --> 1:38:51.740]  authoritarians like Bernie Sanders take over,
[1:38:51.740 --> 1:38:53.740]  we've learned the plan is
[1:38:53.740 --> 1:38:55.740]  to turn capitals and sports stadiums
[1:38:55.740 --> 1:38:57.740]  into reeducation camps to put us in them
[1:38:57.740 --> 1:38:59.740]  and if we don't follow the brainwashing,
[1:38:59.740 --> 1:39:01.740]  we'll be taken over everywhere else in the world
[1:39:01.740 --> 1:39:03.740]  and now they're trying to take over here
[1:39:03.740 --> 1:39:05.740]  because they know they're politically losing
[1:39:05.740 --> 1:39:07.740]  and again, we're not here to fight.
[1:39:07.740 --> 1:39:09.740]  We're not here to start a war.
[1:39:09.740 --> 1:39:11.740]  They're the ones offensively, as you said, David,
[1:39:11.740 --> 1:39:13.740]  coming to take our guns
[1:39:13.740 --> 1:39:15.740]  and if you look at this almost medieval-looking
[1:39:15.740 --> 1:39:17.740]  classic architecture building here
[1:39:17.740 --> 1:39:19.740]  and then behind us, it's right in the middle
[1:39:19.740 --> 1:39:21.740]  of this city
[1:39:21.740 --> 1:39:23.740]  and the only way we're here, the only way we're on air,
[1:39:23.740 --> 1:39:25.740]  the only way I can bring the security
[1:39:25.740 --> 1:39:27.740]  and all these reporters is money
[1:39:27.740 --> 1:39:29.740]  and we're burning through it really, really fast.
[1:39:29.740 --> 1:39:31.740]  I want to thank the listeners for their support.
[1:39:31.740 --> 1:39:33.740]  You see, we're redoubling our efforts,
[1:39:33.740 --> 1:39:35.740]  working even harder for ourselves
[1:39:35.740 --> 1:39:37.740]  and for you and your families. We salute you all,
[1:39:37.740 --> 1:39:39.740]  but money is what it takes
[1:39:39.740 --> 1:39:41.740]  and we sell a ton of product, don't make a big profit on it
[1:39:41.740 --> 1:39:43.740]  because the prices are so good.
[1:39:43.740 --> 1:39:45.740]  We need everybody to get high-quality coffee
[1:39:45.740 --> 1:39:47.740]  at ImpalwareShore.com, to get the high-quality fish oil
[1:39:47.740 --> 1:39:49.740]  that's back to stock for our 3% off.
[1:39:49.740 --> 1:39:51.740]  We need people to understand we've stepped
[1:39:51.740 --> 1:39:53.740]  with the plate here at ImpalwareShore.
[1:39:53.740 --> 1:39:55.740]  We're fighting hard and loving every minute of it,
[1:39:55.740 --> 1:39:57.740]  every year, to hire a bunch of new reporters
[1:39:57.740 --> 1:39:59.740]  and a bunch of new crew. We've hired, like,
[1:39:59.740 --> 1:40:01.740]  three new people in the last two weeks.
[1:40:01.740 --> 1:40:03.740]  We've got new camera people augmenting what we're doing
[1:40:03.740 --> 1:40:05.740]  and you just see the amount of content
[1:40:05.740 --> 1:40:07.740]  and research we're putting out has been astronomical
[1:40:07.740 --> 1:40:09.740]  for the size we are
[1:40:09.740 --> 1:40:11.740]  and David's working seven days a week
[1:40:11.740 --> 1:40:13.740]  and so is the great crew back there.
[1:40:13.740 --> 1:40:15.740]  Again, I want to thank you all for your financial support,
[1:40:15.740 --> 1:40:17.740]  but I get so busy on air and doing all this,
[1:40:17.740 --> 1:40:19.740]  I forget to thank you all
[1:40:19.740 --> 1:40:21.740]  for buying the products at ImpalwareShore.com.
[1:40:21.740 --> 1:40:23.740]  We've got a lot of new specials at the site.

[1:40:25.740 --> 1:40:27.740]  because at prices like this, we sell a lot of product.
[1:40:27.740 --> 1:40:29.740]  Get your whitening toothpaste, high quality,

[1:40:39.740 --> 1:40:41.740]  Staple items that make your life better
[1:40:41.740 --> 1:40:43.740]  and also fun free speech and the defense
[1:40:43.740 --> 1:40:45.740]  of the Second Amendment and the very existence
[1:40:45.740 --> 1:40:47.740]  of our country against these globalists.
[1:40:47.740 --> 1:40:49.740]  David, ImpalwareShore.com
[1:40:49.740 --> 1:40:51.740]  or ImpalwareLife.com takes you right to the shopping cart
[1:40:51.740 --> 1:40:53.740]  of the Second Amendment or 388-253-3139.
[1:40:53.740 --> 1:40:55.740]  And just take action.
[1:40:55.740 --> 1:40:57.740]  These are products you already need
[1:40:57.740 --> 1:40:59.740]  and that's how we're building this
[1:40:59.740 --> 1:41:01.740]  independent media organization that's fearless
[1:41:01.740 --> 1:41:03.740]  and that tells the truth and that explains
[1:41:03.740 --> 1:41:05.740]  we're not here calling for violence.
[1:41:05.740 --> 1:41:07.740]  None of these patrons are calling for violence.
[1:41:07.740 --> 1:41:09.740]  This is all Bloomberg, Soros.
[1:41:09.740 --> 1:41:11.740]  Globalists funded to come in here
[1:41:11.740 --> 1:41:13.740]  and literally disarm the state
[1:41:13.740 --> 1:41:15.740]  and totally enslave it as part of the Globalist Takeover.
[1:41:15.740 --> 1:41:17.740]  Literally, of the state surrounding the District of Columbia
[1:41:17.740 --> 1:41:19.740]  which the globalists think they've already captured.
[1:41:19.740 --> 1:41:24.700]  a multinational war by these powerful forces to take over and literally reverse what America
[1:41:24.700 --> 1:41:29.460]  is about. America was founded on the British trying to come and take the guns for one of
[1:41:29.460 --> 1:41:33.300]  the few countries that still has these rights. And so if people want to go live in tyranny,
[1:41:33.300 --> 1:41:37.700]  they should. But America was founded on these principles and we have multinational forces
[1:41:37.700 --> 1:41:41.300]  that say America was never great and it was never going to be great, trying to take it
[1:41:41.300 --> 1:41:44.460]  over because they know it has been great. A little bit of freedom we've had compared
[1:41:44.460 --> 1:41:48.980]  to other nations made us the apple of the world's eye. So David Knight's got a few
[1:41:48.980 --> 1:41:52.900]  more segments. There's so many incredible bombshell videos that I'll inshroy or Savannah
[1:41:52.900 --> 1:41:58.780]  Hernandez, Millie Weaver, Caitlin Bennett are filing daily at others at band.video.
[1:41:58.780 --> 1:42:01.340]  Only way they get out is when you share the links. And you know what? You've been doing
[1:42:01.340 --> 1:42:08.100]  that. You've been sharing the links and the site is just exploding. Band.video, news wars.com,
[1:42:08.100 --> 1:42:12.500]  news wars.com, port slash show with live feeds as well. And that's how you were Paul Revere's
[1:42:12.500 --> 1:42:18.820]  just as important as Drew and Rob do and the rest of crew here bringing you this information
[1:42:18.820 --> 1:42:24.140]  is you sharing on Twitter, on Facebook, on your email, on your private message and by
[1:42:24.140 --> 1:42:28.660]  word of mouth that, hey, they wanted to shut down the American Liberty movement that warned
[1:42:28.660 --> 1:42:32.300]  the globalists were coming with the guns and that warned pedophiles were running the government.
[1:42:32.300 --> 1:42:36.220]  And now it's all turned out to be true. And our credibility skyrocketing. That's why the
[1:42:36.220 --> 1:42:41.700]  deep state needs us off air ahead of all this because they knew their takeover was coming.
[1:42:41.700 --> 1:42:45.780]  We had too much credibility, but we're still on air next to you in some way stronger. So
[1:42:45.780 --> 1:42:49.580]  again, tomorrow we'll be here starting at 8am with David Knight, back dirt station doing
[1:42:49.580 --> 1:42:55.540]  a great job covering what's happening there. And then the trial of Trump in DC. Hey, you
[1:42:55.540 --> 1:43:03.940]  there. We have a problem. You see, there is a baby. The mother of this baby is not sure
[1:43:03.940 --> 1:43:10.580]  she's ready. The father of this baby doesn't want to settle down. The mother starts to
[1:43:10.580 --> 1:43:19.260]  have regrets. The father considers leaving town. But a friend says there's a solution.
[1:43:19.260 --> 1:43:27.140]  She says to have an abortion. The mother decides to look into it. The clinic assures her it's
[1:43:27.140 --> 1:43:35.420]  safe. She's made her decision. She's going to have an abortion. The problem is that baby
[1:43:35.420 --> 1:43:45.100]  is you. Join me, Owen Schreuer at the March for Life Friday, January 24th in Washington,
[1:43:45.100 --> 1:43:51.580]  DC, noon at the National Mall. I'll see you there. It's time to stand up for the unborn.
[1:43:51.580 --> 1:44:01.380]  It's time to speak out for the voiceless allergies, dander, asthma, germs, toxins. There are many
[1:44:01.380 --> 1:44:05.660]  reasons why we need to think about what is really in the air around us. We may not be
[1:44:05.660 --> 1:44:10.500]  able to stop breathing, but we can control what's in the air we breathe. The revolutionary
[1:44:10.500 --> 1:44:15.580]  Alexa Pure Breeze air filtration system is a powerful ally in the fight against the dangerous
[1:44:15.580 --> 1:44:21.900]  toxins and viruses in the air. Powerful, quiet, and effective, the breeze uses a four-step

[1:44:32.480 --> 1:44:37.380]  most affordable bar none. The breeze in the ion cluster patented technology used in the

[1:44:55.020 --> 1:45:02.060]  On Wood, I am not tempting fate, but everybody around the office, especially folks that have
[1:45:02.060 --> 1:45:07.540]  worked there a long time, have noticed that I really don't ever get sick. Now, again,
[1:45:07.540 --> 1:45:11.980]  I might get sick tomorrow because I just made that statement. I'm not tempting fate. I'll
[1:45:11.980 --> 1:45:15.940]  say that again because I am superstitious when it comes down to that. I'm very thankful
[1:45:15.940 --> 1:45:21.420]  to the good Lord for the Constitution I've been given. But up until about eight, nine
[1:45:21.420 --> 1:45:27.940]  years ago, when I started taking X2 and the products InfoWarsLife, I still got sick every
[1:45:27.940 --> 1:45:32.700]  couple years. And I still get sore throats from allergies and pollen and things like
[1:45:32.700 --> 1:45:39.500]  that. But now that I religiously take the products to InfoWarsLife, one of the highest
[1:45:39.500 --> 1:45:45.220]  quality supplements you're going to find out there, I just never get a fever anymore.
[1:45:45.220 --> 1:45:52.300]  It's probably been three, four years since I've had a fever. It's just crazy. So I chocolate
[1:45:52.300 --> 1:45:54.540]  up the genetics and the great products.
[1:45:54.540 --> 1:45:58.740]  I love watching David Knight in the morning. I love tuning in to Owen Troyer. I love all
[1:45:58.740 --> 1:46:03.420]  the other shows we do here. But I'll be honest with you, we run during the breaks a lot of
[1:46:03.420 --> 1:46:08.580]  news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads. So you think you don't want to hear
[1:46:08.580 --> 1:46:13.220]  an ad? I don't want to hear an ad. But here's the bottom line. We're barely paying the bills
[1:46:13.220 --> 1:46:16.780]  here and I want to expand the face of the globalists, not contract. I don't want them
[1:46:16.780 --> 1:46:22.020]  to win. So listen, you've got this guarantee for me. We sell enough product, we'll have
[1:46:22.020 --> 1:46:26.340]  less ads and less plugs and we'll expand and really give the globalists around for their
[1:46:26.340 --> 1:46:30.980]  money. But we've got products you already really need like DNA Force Plus, X2. These
[1:46:30.980 --> 1:46:34.740]  will change your life. Go check out the turmeric products, check out the water filtration, air
[1:46:34.740 --> 1:46:38.860]  filtration, check it all out. Whatever you do, take action and know, be part of the second
[1:46:38.860 --> 1:46:42.260]  American Revolution. Be part of crushing the globalist and get great products at the same
[1:46:42.260 --> 1:46:47.660]  time. InfoWarsStore.com is the umbrella site. InfoWarsLife.com is the supplements. Take
[1:46:47.660 --> 1:46:57.940]  action now and fund the Info War for your own future.
[1:46:57.940 --> 1:47:19.420]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. He aligns himself with the truth and it's time
[1:47:19.420 --> 1:47:27.980]  for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones. Welcome back. I'm David Knight
[1:47:27.980 --> 1:47:32.220]  here in the studio in Austin and we have Alex Jones in the FEMA camp that the governor
[1:47:32.220 --> 1:47:37.100]  of Virginia has created around the Capitol there and he has some breaking news, Alex.
[1:47:37.100 --> 1:47:40.220]  That's right, David. I just left. You were about to take over and finish up to the fabulous
[1:47:40.220 --> 1:47:47.260]  job and Roberto, who's a longtime listener and caller of the show, from New York who's
[1:47:47.260 --> 1:47:55.700]  down here in Virginia, he said, hey, you know, they've got it all choked down to one point,
[1:47:55.700 --> 1:47:58.700]  which is a major safety issue and we looked it up and absolutely that's true. In fact,
[1:47:58.700 --> 1:48:02.300]  I read that this morning, I'd forgotten it. When you talk about an open air FEMA camp,
[1:48:02.300 --> 1:48:08.580]  the danger, anybody knows, fire marshals wouldn't allow that. If you've got a high school football
[1:48:08.580 --> 1:48:12.620]  game that's got 2,000 people at it, you've got to have at least four exits for each side
[1:48:12.620 --> 1:48:19.140]  of the field over each side of the stadium. And so to be expecting 10,000, 20,000, 30,000
[1:48:19.140 --> 1:48:23.260]  people here, they are confirming that down the road, I guess on 9th Street, you'll tell
[1:48:23.260 --> 1:48:29.260]  us, they're going to choke it down to one lane and try to keep folks from getting in.
[1:48:29.260 --> 1:48:33.660]  The Astro Turf didn't show up for Soros. It is anti-women march. Patriots are going to
[1:48:33.660 --> 1:48:36.900]  stay in the cold. It's a beautiful day tomorrow. We're going to love it if it was sleeting
[1:48:36.900 --> 1:48:41.900]  and snowy, but get here early and don't let it stop you. But the safety issue alone of
[1:48:41.900 --> 1:48:46.820]  one entrance and one exit, pretending like there's this great danger in here because
[1:48:46.820 --> 1:48:50.500]  citizens have got guns when we've always had the guns. And on a regular day, you can just
[1:48:50.500 --> 1:48:53.980]  go in there anyways. So this is them trying to introduce you to the idea that guns are
[1:48:53.980 --> 1:48:57.820]  dirty and they're bad. It's pretty amazing. Roberto, God bless you, brother. I got to
[1:48:57.820 --> 1:49:00.820]  get in closer and have my stick mic. So I'm right here on the earpiece. Let me go and
[1:49:00.820 --> 1:49:07.820]  just put this in your ear. Tell us, tell us why you came down here, what you're doing.
[1:49:07.820 --> 1:49:13.820]  You're losing it across this country. I was a caller recently. I was at the back of
[1:49:13.820 --> 1:49:19.820]  New Jersey. We're here in New York. You're definitely not your business there. So I
[1:49:19.820 --> 1:49:30.900]  came here to stand up for the rights of Americans. I came here to show support and I did some
[1:49:30.900 --> 1:49:41.380]  investigation to try to give myself a situation. They said one entrance, one exit tomorrow
[1:49:41.380 --> 1:49:47.740]  is on ninth and great and it's a narrow corridor. It's kind of, it's really frightening actually
[1:49:47.740 --> 1:49:56.060]  in there. They just passed legislation and they completely disarmed everyone. And no
[1:49:56.060 --> 1:50:04.260]  one there will be armed. The only thing you can have is a clock. And we're going to be
[1:50:04.260 --> 1:50:11.740]  literally surrounded. And you know, and all the people that go into lobbying and the centers
[1:50:11.740 --> 1:50:16.260]  and everyone else is going to be there. You're going to be completely disarmed. And we're
[1:50:16.260 --> 1:50:23.260]  the most, we want to go and actually try to bring change and talk to them and say listen,
[1:50:23.260 --> 1:50:40.780]  this is a public violation. We're going to go with the stick tomorrow. So I'm glad to
[1:50:40.780 --> 1:50:46.420]  be here. It's amazing to be with you guys. And I'm just, be careful because whatever
[1:50:46.420 --> 1:50:49.940]  they're doing is, it's kind of, God bless your brother. We're going to talk to you
[1:50:49.940 --> 1:50:54.300]  again tomorrow with a good handheld microphone and everything. We're always just like 10
[1:50:54.300 --> 1:50:57.460]  years ago, we had an old perfected live fees. We just like changed stuff. Always do it
[1:50:57.460 --> 1:51:01.020]  differently. That's the fun part about info wars. God bless your brother. I appreciate
[1:51:01.020 --> 1:51:05.900]  it. It doesn't matter. We're kicking ass and we're here. Great points. I'm glad you raised
[1:51:05.900 --> 1:51:10.540]  that. So let's get this one other fellow to want to be on camera over here to give his
[1:51:10.540 --> 1:51:16.700]  take on enforcement, military on choking people down like this. It's really violating
[1:51:16.700 --> 1:51:22.500]  local fire codes, state fire codes. Undoubtedly they have 10, 20,000 people choked through
[1:51:22.500 --> 1:51:26.420]  one checkpoint in and out. And I think that's illegal. It just shows the stuff that's going
[1:51:26.420 --> 1:51:31.500]  on. Yeah, absolutely. So walking around and looking at the setup here, it's a huge public
[1:51:31.500 --> 1:51:36.860]  safety concern because if anything happened and they've only got one exit for 10 or 15,000
[1:51:36.860 --> 1:51:42.460]  people, it's irresponsible to set it up that way. So whoever set this up wasn't thinking
[1:51:42.460 --> 1:51:47.900]  and it's obvious they did this in great haste as a response to Governor Northam's knee jerk
[1:51:47.900 --> 1:51:53.980]  reaction of issuing this emergency declaration of a state of emergency. And the whole thing
[1:51:53.980 --> 1:51:58.860]  is poorly planned out. And we're all going to try our best to be safe tomorrow. But people
[1:51:58.860 --> 1:52:04.100]  need to understand if something happens that they need to remain calm and they can't all
[1:52:04.100 --> 1:52:09.020]  run. This is like in Mecca when you hear about thousands getting trampled. Don't be scared.
[1:52:09.020 --> 1:52:12.900]  They want to do this to make you scared. We're not scared, but just come out. But patriots
[1:52:12.900 --> 1:52:17.300]  aren't going to panic the wicked flea when none pursuit, not us. The righteous are bold
[1:52:17.300 --> 1:52:23.460]  and strong as a lion. Absolutely. What else do you want to add about it? Everybody be
[1:52:23.460 --> 1:52:30.260]  safe tomorrow. You know, I encourage people to come out. Okay, exercise your second amendment.
[1:52:30.260 --> 1:52:33.860]  Be aware obviously that, you know, they're going to put restrictions on where you can
[1:52:33.860 --> 1:52:39.420]  carry where you can't. If you do go inside, remain calm. But by all means, we need as
[1:52:39.420 --> 1:52:44.060]  many Americans out here as possible to stand up against this term. And it's key for everybody
[1:52:44.060 --> 1:52:48.380]  to post as much social media as you can to share info wars dot com links, news wars dot
[1:52:48.380 --> 1:52:52.180]  com links, the live band on video links, because everything they're doing is about suppressing
[1:52:52.180 --> 1:52:57.300]  our message to silence us so they can then distort who we are with a straw man. So we
[1:52:57.300 --> 1:53:01.380]  have to stand up as Americans and for freedom and justice and unity. And while we're the
[1:53:01.380 --> 1:53:05.380]  greatest nation on earth, that's what the globalists want to get rid of. We have to
[1:53:05.380 --> 1:53:09.820]  be who we are and speak up or they will steal our identity and speak for us and say we're
[1:53:09.820 --> 1:53:13.700]  a racist nation, we're a hateful nation, we're a bad nation. When they're the globalists,
[1:53:13.700 --> 1:53:17.660]  any nation they take over, they absolutely enslave and destroy. So I'm going to throw
[1:53:17.660 --> 1:53:21.460]  it back to David Knight to finish up. I know the David Knight shows at 8am tomorrow. We
[1:53:21.460 --> 1:53:25.020]  got a guest host, I believe this is all live coverage of not all hosts in the morning. Let
[1:53:25.020 --> 1:53:28.340]  me know guys, because we're got a skeleton crew right now to have most our crew here.
[1:53:28.340 --> 1:53:33.180]  And the David's going to be hosting that show live with different live feeds coming in,
[1:53:33.180 --> 1:53:36.660]  live coverage of us, just up to the minute. And then we're going to have live coverage
[1:53:36.660 --> 1:53:41.140]  on Tuesday with David Knight of the beginning of the Trump trial in the Senate with myself,
[1:53:41.140 --> 1:53:46.580]  Owen Schreuer in the Capitol on the ground in D.C. just north of here. And then it's
[1:53:46.580 --> 1:53:50.140]  going to get even crazier. We're just going to continue on right through the verdict and
[1:53:50.140 --> 1:53:54.420]  everything live coverage. But none of this means anything if you don't share the links
[1:53:54.420 --> 1:53:58.860]  info wars.com forward slash show. I want to thank all the great patrons here tonight.
[1:53:58.860 --> 1:54:06.260]  The answer tonight is 1776. And I salute the great info wars crew. We're going to be kicking
[1:54:06.260 --> 1:54:10.460]  ass for you tomorrow. Back to David Knight and finish it up tonight. Let's pray for justice
[1:54:10.460 --> 1:54:15.300]  and peace here as these tyrants try to create a civil emergency. I believe they will fail.
[1:54:15.300 --> 1:54:19.220]  God bless. All right, that's Alex Jones there at the
[1:54:19.220 --> 1:54:25.060]  Northam FEMA camp. That's what we ought to call it there in Virginia. You know, who is
[1:54:25.060 --> 1:54:29.700]  the conspiracy theorist here? Well, it's actually Governor Northam. He's the one who says that
[1:54:29.700 --> 1:54:35.260]  hey, all these people are trying to come here and shoot the place up. And of course, it's
[1:54:35.260 --> 1:54:40.500]  the Democrats, as I pointed out before, the Democrats suits people like Mark Levine, who
[1:54:40.500 --> 1:54:47.380]  is a Harvard Yale graduate, a Democrat there in the state government who says if you think
[1:54:47.380 --> 1:54:52.300]  your AR 15 will do diddly against the full might and power of the US military, you need
[1:54:52.300 --> 1:54:57.460]  to talk to somebody who served there. Well, you know, Mark, maybe you need to talk to
[1:54:57.460 --> 1:55:03.580]  somebody who served there. Maybe you need to talk to the veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan
[1:55:03.580 --> 1:55:10.700]  war who understand the futility of asymmetric warfare. And maybe you won't try to do that
[1:55:10.700 --> 1:55:15.940]  here in America because you haven't won those wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, anywhere else you've
[1:55:15.940 --> 1:55:20.940]  tried to do this. And we've got a lot more guns and know much better how to use them
[1:55:20.940 --> 1:55:25.860]  than the people in those countries ever did. But look, we understand who the rebels are
[1:55:25.860 --> 1:55:29.820]  here, right? The people who are rebelling against the Constitution, the people who are
[1:55:29.820 --> 1:55:34.900]  trying to overthrow what we have had in this country, the rights that we've had in this
[1:55:34.900 --> 1:55:40.500]  country for centuries. It's the Democrats. It's the Democrats suits. But they want to
[1:55:40.500 --> 1:55:44.660]  tell you that these other people are the ones who are dangerous. No, it's these people like
[1:55:44.660 --> 1:55:49.460]  Mark Levine, people like Eric Swalwell. Oh, we got nuclear weapons and they're legit.
[1:55:49.460 --> 1:55:53.500]  You're going to find out about it. Or these other people, the other Virginia delegate
[1:55:53.500 --> 1:55:56.420]  who said, well, we got to use the National Guard against these people. We got to use the
[1:55:56.420 --> 1:56:01.060]  full force to the US military, maybe nuclear weapons, better work and the rest of these
[1:56:01.060 --> 1:56:07.740]  people. They're the ones who are trying to take away our human rights. And it's not just
[1:56:07.740 --> 1:56:16.100]  the firearms. They have two bills in Virginia House bill 1090 and House bill 1489. Both
[1:56:16.100 --> 1:56:21.700]  of them would take away your freedom, your health freedom, your informed consent. They
[1:56:21.700 --> 1:56:26.340]  would take away your parental rights as well. And these have also been introduced. See,
[1:56:26.340 --> 1:56:31.940]  it's not just the guns. We have, for example, what's in these bills? Well, we've got the
[1:56:31.940 --> 1:56:36.780]  an HPV vaccine mandate that will extend that mandate from females to males. That's the
[1:56:36.780 --> 1:56:44.060]  first one 1489. It'll add a seventh grade booster to the adverse event prone Tdap shot.
[1:56:44.060 --> 1:56:50.100]  It'll say that from the age of 12 months on, you've got to get chickenpox shots. The other
[1:56:50.100 --> 1:56:58.100]  bill will add 10 more vaccines to bring it up to 69 mandated doses of 16 different vaccines.
[1:56:58.100 --> 1:57:02.980]  And it will move the authority for that from Virginia to the federal government. And even
[1:57:02.980 --> 1:57:10.740]  of course, this bill will subject children to any of the 264 vaccines and active development
[1:57:10.740 --> 1:57:17.140]  once they are approved by the FDA and the chief marketer of these vaccines, the CDC.
[1:57:17.140 --> 1:57:22.700]  That is all about the money and the power. This is why we need to understand these people
[1:57:22.700 --> 1:57:28.580]  are pirates. They want no restrictions on the power of central government and they want
[1:57:28.580 --> 1:57:34.820]  to extend that power into every detail of your life. You need to understand what words
[1:57:34.820 --> 1:57:40.900]  mean. Militia is not a dirty word, but authoritarianism is. That's it for the broadcast. Join us
[1:57:40.900 --> 1:58:00.580]  tomorrow morning.
