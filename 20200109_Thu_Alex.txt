[00:00.000 --> 00:20.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:20.000 --> 00:29.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:29.000 --> 00:33.000]  One of the leading constitutional experts in the country is Jonathan Turley.
[00:33.000 --> 00:36.000]  He's a classical liberal. I really respect him.
[00:36.000 --> 00:42.000]  And he's pointed out that the impeachment against President Trump is the real crime, the way it's been conducted.
[00:42.000 --> 00:45.000]  His textbook, tyranny and very dangerous rule of law.
[00:45.000 --> 00:55.000]  And I've had him on many times over the years, and we used to talk about how Congress was trying to hand war powers to President Bush and then Obama
[00:55.000 --> 01:02.000]  that aren't in the Bill of Rights or Constitution. We're talking about major wars, major invasions,
[01:02.000 --> 01:09.000]  and saying that the President can just decide to do that without Congress, and that is not the case.
[01:09.000 --> 01:17.000]  To declare war is to declare a major adversary and what you're going to do with that war.
[01:17.000 --> 01:23.000]  But since the time of nuclear weapons particularly, and even before that,
[01:23.000 --> 01:30.000]  if there are ICBMs fired or cruise missiles or a boat coming into a harbor that's got an atomic bomb on board,
[01:30.000 --> 01:37.000]  the default position is the commander in chief and the military can make those chain of command decisions.
[01:37.000 --> 01:45.000]  And it goes back to when George Washington was president, he made military decisions on a routine basis about the borders
[01:45.000 --> 01:51.000]  and about troop deployments and things like that without going to Congress.
[01:51.000 --> 01:56.000]  And they had big debates pressuring the President to join with the French Revolution,
[01:56.000 --> 02:01.000]  which he would not do, saying it's corrupted out of control and not like our revolution.
[02:01.000 --> 02:08.000]  And they tried to hand him those powers verbally, and Washington said,
[02:08.000 --> 02:11.000]  no, you're going to have to debate that in Congress and all the rest of it,
[02:11.000 --> 02:15.000]  and you're going to have to give me the order to do that.
[02:15.000 --> 02:19.000]  And if you try to give me the order to do that, I may not go along with it.
[02:19.000 --> 02:28.000]  And of course, they wanted him to join with the French to fight the British in Canada after he was president.
[02:28.000 --> 02:29.000]  He didn't do that.
[02:29.000 --> 02:32.000]  So you can get constitutional lawyers on.
[02:32.000 --> 02:34.000]  You can talk about it all day long.
[02:34.000 --> 02:42.000]  But the president striking someone who's already on a terrorist list and who is a military target,
[02:42.000 --> 02:51.000]  who is admittedly been behind directing Shiite militias and attacks on Western allies
[02:51.000 --> 03:01.000]  and forces for decades to say that that is illegal like Nancy Pelosi's done
[03:01.000 --> 03:05.000]  and try to talk about that being another article of impeachment is a complete fraud.
[03:05.000 --> 03:08.000]  The president just minutes ago responded to that.
[03:08.000 --> 03:11.000]  We're going to come back from rank and play with the president said,
[03:11.000 --> 03:15.000]  we're going to get into what Nancy Pelosi had to say.
[03:15.000 --> 03:20.000]  And then meanwhile, whenever the vice president was calling them to talk about what was happening
[03:20.000 --> 03:26.000]  and about the missiles being fired, Pelosi wouldn't even take the phone call.
[03:26.000 --> 03:36.000]  So yes, it's good to notify Congress and Congress should weigh in on new fronts that are opened up.
[03:36.000 --> 03:41.000]  And Congress should weigh in, I believe, on pulling troops out of areas as well.
[03:41.000 --> 03:44.000]  Because that's the people's house.
[03:44.000 --> 03:46.000]  And then the president executes the laws.
[03:46.000 --> 03:50.000]  But the laws are clearly on the president's side, just like he can control our borders.
[03:50.000 --> 03:54.000]  That's in the Constitution.
[03:54.000 --> 03:56.000]  Because they know that laws move too slowly.
[03:56.000 --> 04:02.000]  A president has the power to completely shut the borders that the president wants to.
[04:02.000 --> 04:08.000]  And appeals court has overturned a lower court saying that Trump couldn't use military funds to build the wall.
[04:08.000 --> 04:10.000]  Of course, you can spend military funds.
[04:10.000 --> 04:15.000]  Our military spends on average four times a year.
[04:15.000 --> 04:21.000]  Look it up on building fences and barriers in Afghanistan than we spend on the damn walls here.
[04:21.000 --> 04:27.000]  So why the hell can the military build walls all over the world with the Army Corps of Engineers?
[04:27.000 --> 04:32.000]  But we can't build Jack Squat here with the military.
[04:32.000 --> 04:39.000]  The only place the military is supposed to be at a federal level under the president is on the damn borders,
[04:39.000 --> 04:41.000]  unless the governor has asked the president to come in.
[04:41.000 --> 04:43.000]  And again, that's just how the country works.
[04:43.000 --> 04:45.000]  It's called the federal system.
[04:45.000 --> 04:47.000]  People are like, oh, federal means it's all federal.
[04:47.000 --> 04:50.000]  No, federal means the separation of state and federal.
[04:50.000 --> 04:51.000]  We'll be back. This is huge.
[04:51.000 --> 04:52.000]  Stay with us so much more.
[04:52.000 --> 04:54.000]  They're starting the impeachment trial.
[04:54.000 --> 04:59.000]  Next week it looks like. Stay with us.
[04:59.000 --> 05:03.000]  The globalists know that I will never willingly give up.
[05:03.000 --> 05:06.000]  I've said it many times, I will never give in.
[05:06.000 --> 05:10.000]  I will never give up, but I could give out.
[05:10.000 --> 05:15.000]  And it's very, very frustrating to see them committing all their crimes against humanity,
[05:15.000 --> 05:24.000]  to see evil running rampant like this, and to know that most Americans have already been silenced in cyberspace.
[05:24.000 --> 05:28.000]  That most Americans have already been shadow banned by big tech.
[05:28.000 --> 05:34.000]  And to know that most Americans feel powerless and don't realize how much power they have
[05:34.000 --> 05:40.000]  by spreading the word about newswars.com, infowars.com, and band.video.
[05:40.000 --> 05:43.000]  And that people are hungry for the truth now more than ever.
[05:43.000 --> 05:47.000]  And then if you tell people, hey, the banned truth they don't want you to have
[05:47.000 --> 05:51.000]  is at infowars.com, forward slash show, and band.video.
[05:51.000 --> 05:55.000]  So take heart, folks. They've had to censor everybody and show everybody down
[05:55.000 --> 06:14.000]  because the truth is powerful and they can't beat us fair and square.
[06:25.000 --> 06:33.000]  Some very, very healthy things are happening right now in our country and the world.
[06:33.000 --> 06:37.000]  And yes, it's very gross on the surface when you discover all the bad things
[06:37.000 --> 06:39.000]  and they get brought to life.
[06:39.000 --> 06:47.000]  It'd be like if you were going out to an old cabin that was grandma's in the woods.
[06:47.000 --> 06:50.000]  It's just been given to you in an inheritance.
[06:50.000 --> 06:55.000]  You go there and you pull back the stove and stuff and there's big rats nest and things
[06:55.000 --> 06:57.000]  and there's cockroaches everywhere.
[06:57.000 --> 07:01.000]  It's gross. It's a problem. You've got to clean it up, but you're there and you're fixing it.
[07:01.000 --> 07:04.000]  I'll use another analogy to what's currently happening.
[07:04.000 --> 07:11.000]  I was in D.C. like 10 years ago, walked up and was videotaping the front of the building
[07:11.000 --> 07:15.000]  and a guard jumps out of federal guard and goes, why do you die?
[07:15.000 --> 07:22.000]  And I jumped and hit my leg on the foot of the column that was about two and a half feet tall
[07:22.000 --> 07:26.000]  and it cut through my pants, cut my leg.
[07:26.000 --> 07:30.000]  And about a week later, it was burning and itching and hurting
[07:30.000 --> 07:34.000]  and I'd put some topical iodine on it and colloidal silver and things
[07:34.000 --> 07:36.000]  and it kind of went away and then pretty soon my legs swole up.
[07:36.000 --> 07:39.000]  This is about two weeks later and I went to the doctor.
[07:39.000 --> 07:47.000]  They x-rated and they said, man, the one area in the body is the sheath over the shin doesn't have nerves
[07:47.000 --> 07:52.000]  and also doesn't have enough white blood cells and this is why people get their legs chopped off.
[07:52.000 --> 07:57.000]  You have gangrene growing inside your leg and we're going to have to cut it open
[07:57.000 --> 08:01.000]  and I had them do it local because it was just some points they cut open
[08:01.000 --> 08:06.000]  and they drained off about 10 ounces of pus
[08:06.000 --> 08:09.000]  and put me on a bunch of antibiotics and injected me with antibiotics
[08:09.000 --> 08:14.000]  and the burning pain in my leg though went away in minutes with those antibiotics.
[08:14.000 --> 08:17.000]  I mean, literally like 30 minutes later, I was feeling the pain subside
[08:17.000 --> 08:25.000]  but as the pus was pouring out, just gushing out, they were filling containers with it.
[08:25.000 --> 08:27.000]  My leg was swollen but not that much.
[08:27.000 --> 08:29.000]  I was like, where is it all coming from?
[08:29.000 --> 08:38.000]  That you would think I always joked the Supreme Court bit me because it really did.
[08:38.000 --> 08:41.000]  That was a dirty evil building or what?
[08:41.000 --> 08:44.000]  It's just crazy because I've never had an infection like that
[08:44.000 --> 08:51.000]  but the old days they just saw my leg off before antibiotics.
[08:51.000 --> 08:56.000]  A couple million folks that their legs saw off of Civil War alone, World War I as well
[08:56.000 --> 08:59.000]  and I'm digressing into history.
[08:59.000 --> 09:03.000]  It looked horrible but thank God I finally found out what was happening.
[09:03.000 --> 09:05.000]  I took it serious and it was way worse than I thought
[09:05.000 --> 09:09.000]  and it looked terrible at the point of the problem being fixed
[09:09.000 --> 09:14.000]  and so it could have been demoralizing to see all that pus pouring out
[09:14.000 --> 09:18.000]  but the doctors like it's good news, we caught it on time
[09:18.000 --> 09:22.000]  and it was all the way rotting from the middle of my shin
[09:22.000 --> 09:28.000]  down into my foot, it had opened up channels all the way around my skin
[09:28.000 --> 09:31.000]  onto the pad of my foot.
[09:31.000 --> 09:33.000]  It was eating, eating it all.
[09:33.000 --> 09:35.000]  Now I'm going to stop talking about that gross story
[09:35.000 --> 09:37.000]  but that's how America is.
[09:37.000 --> 09:40.000]  We've had all this rot underneath the surface
[09:40.000 --> 09:46.000]  and we lance it and pus comes out
[09:46.000 --> 09:51.000]  and we go, my God we're horrible, we're terrible, this is disgusting
[09:51.000 --> 09:54.000]  and at the end of the day the corrupt evil forces
[09:54.000 --> 09:58.000]  that have been creating the rot are panicking.
[09:58.000 --> 10:03.000]  They don't know what to do and they know that humanity is awakening
[10:03.000 --> 10:05.000]  and let me just give you some examples of this.
[10:05.000 --> 10:08.000]  Pelosi was going to try to hold up the impeachment
[10:08.000 --> 10:10.000]  and bring forward new articles that's failing
[10:10.000 --> 10:13.000]  and Graham is saying the word is they're about to capitulate
[10:13.000 --> 10:15.000]  and the trial will probably start next week
[10:15.000 --> 10:19.000]  which will exonerate the president.
[10:19.000 --> 10:22.000]  Here's another example.
[10:22.000 --> 10:28.000]  Picks of Clinton aboard Epstein-Pito plane with sex slaves emerge.
[10:28.000 --> 10:32.000]  Now this is old news for us but it's huge news for everybody else
[10:32.000 --> 10:35.000]  and I'm getting flooded with phone calls and text messages
[10:35.000 --> 10:38.000]  and people saying I apologize, you're vindicated, you're totally right.
[10:38.000 --> 10:40.000]  How did you know about this?
[10:40.000 --> 10:42.000]  How did you understand?
[10:42.000 --> 10:47.000]  Well because it was actually public information.
[10:47.000 --> 10:50.000]  New York Times reporter claims IP address hacked
[10:50.000 --> 10:53.000]  to download child porn, Paul Krugman.
[10:53.000 --> 10:56.000]  Disgusting Twitter promotes pedophilia openly.
[10:56.000 --> 10:58.000]  We're going to get to all that today but the point is
[10:58.000 --> 11:01.000]  it's disgusting to learn about all this
[11:01.000 --> 11:04.000]  but the good news is the process of rectifying it
[11:04.000 --> 11:07.000]  like the infestation in the Catholic Church
[11:07.000 --> 11:09.000]  rotting its leg off.
[11:09.000 --> 11:10.000]  We now know about it.
[11:10.000 --> 11:15.000]  The infestation in the Boy Scouts, we now know about it.
[11:15.000 --> 11:18.000]  The Democrats openly wanting our guns.
[11:18.000 --> 11:19.000]  We now know about it.
[11:19.000 --> 11:22.000]  Big news on that front.
[11:22.000 --> 11:27.000]  The Islamic conspiracy with the Democrats to take over
[11:27.000 --> 11:29.000]  what's left of the West, we know about that.
[11:29.000 --> 11:33.000]  Now we're awake and it's not the traitor within
[11:33.000 --> 11:36.000]  sneaking around secretly whispering in the corridors.
[11:36.000 --> 11:38.000]  Now the enemy's banners are out in the open
[11:38.000 --> 11:40.000]  because they were making their move
[11:40.000 --> 11:44.000]  but patriots like you specifically.
[11:44.000 --> 11:46.000]  Many of you have been in the Liberty Movement
[11:46.000 --> 11:47.000]  before I was born.
[11:47.000 --> 11:49.000]  No more than I know.
[11:49.000 --> 11:50.000]  Literally.
[11:50.000 --> 11:51.000]  That's not patronization.
[11:51.000 --> 11:54.000]  You are the salt of the earth.
[11:54.000 --> 11:56.000]  You know who you are out there.
[11:56.000 --> 11:58.000]  You identified the threat.
[11:58.000 --> 11:59.000]  You understood it.
[11:59.000 --> 12:00.000]  You cared what others slept.
[12:00.000 --> 12:02.000]  You were the watchman on the wall.
[12:02.000 --> 12:04.000]  You were the sentinels.
[12:04.000 --> 12:09.000]  And now we are the main movement worldwide
[12:09.000 --> 12:11.000]  in resistance to the globalist
[12:11.000 --> 12:13.000]  because all the other ideologies are fake.
[12:13.000 --> 12:16.000]  There's the Satanic World Government Anti-Human Project
[12:16.000 --> 12:18.000]  and there's the Pro-Human Project
[12:18.000 --> 12:20.000]  of Jesus Christ of Nazareth.
[12:20.000 --> 12:22.000]  Those are the systems.
[12:22.000 --> 12:26.000]  And we are effectively bringing forward
[12:26.000 --> 12:29.000]  the real counter to this Satanism.
[12:29.000 --> 12:31.000]  And that doesn't mean I'm some holy vessel
[12:31.000 --> 12:32.000]  and I'm holier than now
[12:32.000 --> 12:35.000]  because I sit at the crossroads of this fight
[12:35.000 --> 12:37.000]  and it is exhilarating.
[12:37.000 --> 12:38.000]  It is horrifying.
[12:38.000 --> 12:42.000]  It is quite frankly very tempting
[12:42.000 --> 12:46.000]  whenever you're focusing and covering evil
[12:46.000 --> 12:48.000]  that it can literally jump into you.
[12:48.000 --> 12:49.000]  I wouldn't call it possession
[12:49.000 --> 12:52.000]  but it's almost like picking up the gleam of the evil
[12:52.000 --> 12:54.000]  on your soul.
[12:54.000 --> 12:57.000]  And it's spiritual warfare is what it is.
[12:57.000 --> 12:59.000]  And I'm humble.
[12:59.000 --> 13:03.000]  But I wonder if I know I come off as very arrogant
[13:03.000 --> 13:05.000]  because it's not arrogance, folks.
[13:05.000 --> 13:07.000]  It's courage.
[13:07.000 --> 13:10.000]  And it's because if you're going to go into a fight like this
[13:10.000 --> 13:12.000]  you better go into it 110%.
[13:12.000 --> 13:15.000]  And all you're getting for me is what I really believe
[13:15.000 --> 13:16.000]  and what I really stand for.
[13:16.000 --> 13:18.000]  And I am a wild man
[13:18.000 --> 13:19.000]  and I want to apologize sometimes
[13:19.000 --> 13:21.000]  if I come off like a complete maniac
[13:21.000 --> 13:23.000]  because I am a maniac.
[13:23.000 --> 13:25.000]  Okay.
[13:25.000 --> 13:27.000]  I'm not a maniac if I'm doing laundry
[13:27.000 --> 13:28.000]  or cooking dinner
[13:28.000 --> 13:29.000]  or swimming in the swimming pool
[13:29.000 --> 13:30.000]  or taking a hike.
[13:30.000 --> 13:31.000]  I'm a nice man.
[13:31.000 --> 13:32.000]  But when I sit here
[13:32.000 --> 13:33.000]  and I study this every day
[13:33.000 --> 13:34.000]  and I fight it
[13:34.000 --> 13:35.000]  and I face these people
[13:35.000 --> 13:37.000]  and I confirm how evil they are
[13:37.000 --> 13:40.000]  at point-like range, then I can't help
[13:40.000 --> 13:43.000]  but start burying my teeth
[13:43.000 --> 13:49.000]  because we are in the presence of evil, ladies and gentlemen.
[13:49.000 --> 13:50.000]  And if you're in the presence
[13:50.000 --> 13:52.000]  of a bunch of vampiric devil-worshipping
[13:52.000 --> 13:54.000]  child-molesting demons,
[13:54.000 --> 13:56.000]  how are you going to behave?
[13:56.000 --> 13:58.000]  A lot of people are going to grab the crucifix
[13:58.000 --> 14:00.000]  and curl up in the corner.
[14:00.000 --> 14:01.000]  I'm not doing that.
[14:01.000 --> 14:03.000]  And I don't act like this to try to act tough.
[14:03.000 --> 14:05.000]  I can't help it
[14:05.000 --> 14:09.000]  that in the presence of this enemy,
[14:09.000 --> 14:11.000]  I feel savage fury
[14:11.000 --> 14:15.000]  and God's destructive anger.
[14:15.000 --> 14:17.000]  I feel vengeance.
[14:17.000 --> 14:19.000]  But God's always there saying,
[14:19.000 --> 14:20.000]  vengeance is mine,
[14:20.000 --> 14:21.000]  but you get in the presence of God.
[14:21.000 --> 14:23.000]  All you feel is vengeance
[14:23.000 --> 14:25.000]  for all the innocent that have been stomped
[14:25.000 --> 14:27.000]  and destroyed and sucked dry
[14:27.000 --> 14:28.000]  and their future stolen
[14:28.000 --> 14:30.000]  and their innocence destroyed.
[14:30.000 --> 14:32.000]  I'm going to stop preaching.
[14:32.000 --> 14:34.000]  But the spirit of God is so strong
[14:34.000 --> 14:36.000]  in the planet right now
[14:36.000 --> 14:38.000]  because the enemy spirit is strong.
[14:38.000 --> 14:39.000]  For every action,
[14:39.000 --> 14:40.000]  there's an opposite-equal reaction
[14:40.000 --> 14:43.000]  and it's just going to leverage up now.
[14:43.000 --> 14:45.000]  And you're going to see incredibly good things.
[14:45.000 --> 14:49.000]  You're going to see incredibly bad things.
[14:49.000 --> 14:52.000]  It's just one hell of a time to be alive.
[14:52.000 --> 14:55.000]  I mean, I've got dozens of bombshell stories here.
[14:55.000 --> 14:58.000]  The view endorsed Richard Spencer,
[14:58.000 --> 15:03.000]  the leading white supremacist in the U.S.
[15:03.000 --> 15:05.000]  I mean, I'm telling you,
[15:05.000 --> 15:07.000]  these people like the Bible says
[15:07.000 --> 15:09.000]  are being given over to strong delusion
[15:09.000 --> 15:13.000]  and are going completely insane in front of us.
[15:13.000 --> 15:16.000]  But they're throwing off all that psychic insanity
[15:16.000 --> 15:18.000]  and you think, oh, it's because they're failing
[15:18.000 --> 15:19.000]  and it is.
[15:19.000 --> 15:21.000]  But when evil starts going down,
[15:21.000 --> 15:23.000]  it activates its own people to go crazy
[15:23.000 --> 15:25.000]  and try to bring the system down itself
[15:25.000 --> 15:28.000]  and us with them because we're all psychically connected
[15:28.000 --> 15:31.000]  and so they want their insanity to spread to us.
[15:31.000 --> 15:34.000]  So they're detonating themselves like psychic suicide bombers
[15:34.000 --> 15:36.000]  and we're feeling it.
[15:36.000 --> 15:39.000]  But we've just got to tie ourselves to God,
[15:39.000 --> 15:43.000]  ask for peace and just try to de-escalate in our own self
[15:43.000 --> 15:45.000]  so that we don't explode like I'm about to.
[15:45.000 --> 15:47.000]  Believe me, I'm not lecturing.
[15:47.000 --> 15:49.000]  I'm telling you what God's telling me and what I've got to do
[15:49.000 --> 15:52.000]  is just get in that quiet place of the Most High
[15:52.000 --> 15:55.000]  or we'll get destroyed with the evil.
[15:55.000 --> 15:58.000]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[15:58.000 --> 16:01.000]  So do you know who's on your wireless network?
[16:01.000 --> 16:04.000]  Whether it's a big company selling your data
[16:04.000 --> 16:06.000]  or a foreign hacker, if you're not protected,
[16:06.000 --> 16:08.000]  everybody sees your information.
[16:08.000 --> 16:11.000]  That's why you need Flash Routers,
[16:11.000 --> 16:14.000]  a custom Wi-Fi router created for privacy.

[17:23.000 --> 17:25.000]  on this primitive survival tool.
[17:25.000 --> 17:54.000]  That's real, only at Slingbow.com.
[17:55.000 --> 17:58.000]  Dan Pilla dot com.
[18:25.000 --> 18:27.000]  I think the big difference, the game changer in this
[18:27.000 --> 18:30.000]  is the coral calcium because after I brush my teeth with this,
[18:30.000 --> 18:33.000]  they feel so clean and the toothpaste,
[18:33.000 --> 18:36.000]  I don't even like rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this.
[18:36.000 --> 18:38.000]  It feels so good.
[18:38.000 --> 18:42.000]  It feels like good things are happening in my mouth.
[18:42.000 --> 18:46.000]  In fact, I find myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day
[18:46.000 --> 18:48.000]  rather than just twice a day now
[18:48.000 --> 18:59.000]  because I like the way it feels.
[18:59.000 --> 19:03.000]  Knock on wood, I am not tempting fate,
[19:03.000 --> 19:05.000]  but everybody around the office,
[19:05.000 --> 19:08.000]  especially folks that have worked there a long time,
[19:08.000 --> 19:11.000]  have noticed that I really don't ever get sick.
[19:11.000 --> 19:13.000]  Now, again, I might get sick tomorrow
[19:13.000 --> 19:15.000]  because I just made that statement,
[19:15.000 --> 19:16.000]  I'm not tempting fate.
[19:16.000 --> 19:18.000]  I'll say that again because I am superstitious
[19:18.000 --> 19:20.000]  when it comes down to that.
[19:20.000 --> 19:22.000]  I'm very thankful to the good Lord for the Constitution
[19:22.000 --> 19:24.000]  I've been given.
[19:24.000 --> 19:26.000]  But up until about eight, nine years ago
[19:26.000 --> 19:29.000]  when I started taking X2
[19:29.000 --> 19:31.000]  in the product's enforced life,
[19:31.000 --> 19:34.000]  I still got sick every couple of years.
[19:34.000 --> 19:36.000]  And I still get sore throats from allergies
[19:36.000 --> 19:38.000]  and pollen and things like that.
[19:38.000 --> 19:42.000]  But now that I religiously take the products
[19:42.000 --> 19:44.000]  that enforce life,
[19:44.000 --> 19:46.000]  the supplements you're going to find out there,
[19:46.000 --> 19:49.000]  I just never get a fever anymore.
[19:49.000 --> 19:52.000]  It's probably been three, four years
[19:52.000 --> 19:54.000]  since I've had a fever.
[19:54.000 --> 19:56.000]  It's just crazy.
[19:56.000 --> 20:25.000]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[20:25.000 --> 20:30.000]  298 days until the 2020 election.
[20:30.000 --> 20:33.000]  We have cleared the decks of guests
[20:33.000 --> 20:38.000]  and starting...
[20:38.000 --> 20:40.000]  In the last segment of this hour,
[20:40.000 --> 20:42.000]  we will go to your phone calls on
[20:42.000 --> 20:44.000]  any of the issues I'm going to cover,
[20:44.000 --> 20:46.000]  any topics you want to cover,
[20:46.000 --> 20:48.000]  any news stories you want to bring to our attention.
[20:48.000 --> 20:51.000]  You agree, you disagree.
[20:51.000 --> 20:53.000]  First-time callers, long-time callers,
[20:53.000 --> 20:55.000]  people that agree, disagree.
[20:55.000 --> 20:57.000]  You are all welcome,
[20:57.000 --> 21:00.000]  but I want first-time callers to be able to call in now
[21:00.000 --> 21:02.000]  so they get at the front of the line
[21:02.000 --> 21:04.000]  and then long-time callers and others.
[21:04.000 --> 21:06.000]  If you want to call in after we take
[21:06.000 --> 21:08.000]  the first round of first-time callers,
[21:08.000 --> 21:11.000]  you are absolutely welcome to join us.
[21:11.000 --> 21:13.000]  I'm going to give the number out
[21:13.000 --> 21:15.000]  at the start of the next segment,
[21:15.000 --> 21:17.000]  so don't start your engines yet,
[21:17.000 --> 21:19.000]  and I just can't wait to hear your amazing calls
[21:19.000 --> 21:21.000]  and your perspectives.
[21:21.000 --> 21:23.000]  When I talk about
[21:23.000 --> 21:25.000]  the great awakening that's happening
[21:25.000 --> 21:27.000]  and it seems horrible as we discover
[21:27.000 --> 21:29.000]  the bad things that are going on,
[21:29.000 --> 21:31.000]  if you have a skin cancer on your back
[21:31.000 --> 21:33.000]  and you discover you've got skin cancer,
[21:33.000 --> 21:35.000]  but it's like, hey, it's okay,
[21:35.000 --> 21:37.000]  they can cut it off really easy,
[21:37.000 --> 21:39.000]  99% operable,
[21:39.000 --> 21:41.000]  that's a good thing.
[21:41.000 --> 21:43.000]  It's the same thing, like,
[21:43.000 --> 21:45.000]  whoa, you're really deficient in B12.
[21:45.000 --> 21:47.000]  That's why you're having these medical problems.
[21:47.000 --> 21:49.000]  Take B12, you're going to be fine.
[21:49.000 --> 21:51.000]  If there's a solution
[21:51.000 --> 21:53.000]  to a problem,
[21:53.000 --> 21:55.000]  don't you want to know the solution?
[21:55.000 --> 21:57.000]  So many times in life and in media
[21:57.000 --> 21:59.000]  and people have learned that around here with me,
[21:59.000 --> 22:01.000]  I just want to know
[22:01.000 --> 22:03.000]  the bad news right now.
[22:03.000 --> 22:05.000]  I want to know the worst of it.
[22:05.000 --> 22:07.000]  I want to know the worst-case scenario
[22:07.000 --> 22:09.000]  so I can do something about it.
[22:09.000 --> 22:11.000]  So many other people, they want to sweep it
[22:11.000 --> 22:13.000]  under the rug and just imagine
[22:13.000 --> 22:15.000]  that everything is okay.
[22:15.000 --> 22:17.000]  And what does that do?
[22:17.000 --> 22:19.000]  Well, it's that attitude of so what
[22:19.000 --> 22:21.000]  that brings down civilization.
[22:21.000 --> 22:23.000]  It's the problem in the third world.
[22:25.000 --> 22:27.000]  What's upset the West apart is that
[22:27.000 --> 22:29.000]  we try to build systems,
[22:29.000 --> 22:31.000]  control those systems, control our environment,
[22:31.000 --> 22:33.000]  and build a system
[22:33.000 --> 22:35.000]  for humans, a pro-human future.
[22:35.000 --> 22:37.000]  Not a future
[22:37.000 --> 22:39.000]  based on conquest and destruction.
[22:39.000 --> 22:41.000]  So I've got Trump's
[22:41.000 --> 22:43.000]  speech and response
[22:43.000 --> 22:45.000]  to Pelosi in the war power situation.
[22:45.000 --> 22:47.000]  I've got Pelosi's response.
[22:47.000 --> 22:49.000]  We're going to get to that at the start of the next segment.
[22:49.000 --> 22:51.000]  But let me just go over
[22:51.000 --> 22:53.000]  the news I'm going to hit
[22:53.000 --> 22:55.000]  when we start the next hour.
[22:55.000 --> 22:57.000]  Because what I'm going to do is I'm going to come in, hit a few stories,
[22:57.000 --> 22:59.000]  take a few calls, hit a few stories,
[22:59.000 --> 23:01.000]  take a few calls.
[23:01.000 --> 23:03.000]  A lot of people are like,
[23:03.000 --> 23:05.000]  oh really, what's the big deal?
[23:05.000 --> 23:07.000]  Bill Clinton flew
[23:07.000 --> 23:09.000]  hundreds of times, we now know,
[23:09.000 --> 23:11.000]  on the Lolita Express
[23:11.000 --> 23:13.000]  without Secret Service.
[23:13.000 --> 23:15.000]  But he's on there
[23:15.000 --> 23:17.000]  40 something times on the logs
[23:17.000 --> 23:19.000]  and you're talking girls
[23:19.000 --> 23:21.000]  as young as 14,
[23:21.000 --> 23:23.000]  some of which had been purchased from their parents
[23:23.000 --> 23:25.000]  in Eastern Europe
[23:25.000 --> 23:27.000]  when they were 12 years old.
[23:29.000 --> 23:31.000]  12 year old girls.
[23:31.000 --> 23:33.000]  My middle daughter
[23:33.000 --> 23:35.000]  is turning 12
[23:35.000 --> 23:37.000]  on Valentine's Day.
[23:37.000 --> 23:39.000]  Can you imagine
[23:39.000 --> 23:41.000]  your parents selling you
[23:41.000 --> 23:43.000]  from someplace like
[23:43.000 --> 23:45.000]  Moldova
[23:45.000 --> 23:47.000]  and
[23:47.000 --> 23:49.000]  you're put on a
[23:49.000 --> 23:51.000]  Dinecore jet, that's how they did all this,
[23:51.000 --> 23:53.000]  those congressional hearings.
[23:55.000 --> 23:57.000]  And then they fly you to
[23:57.000 --> 23:59.000]  Jeffrey Epstein.
[24:01.000 --> 24:03.000]  So people keep asking me, oh,
[24:03.000 --> 24:05.000]  how do you know about Lolita Express
[24:05.000 --> 24:07.000]  and about little St. John's
[24:07.000 --> 24:09.000]  Caribbean and all of this?
[24:11.000 --> 24:13.000]  The truth is,
[24:13.000 --> 24:15.000]  when I start thinking about
[24:15.000 --> 24:17.000]  oh yeah, we did
[24:17.000 --> 24:19.000]  talk about Epstein 13 years ago,
[24:19.000 --> 24:21.000]  but why do we talk about him?
[24:21.000 --> 24:23.000]  Because he had chartered
[24:23.000 --> 24:25.000]  Dinecore aircraft running kids
[24:25.000 --> 24:27.000]  all over the damn world,
[24:27.000 --> 24:29.000]  not just the ones
[24:29.000 --> 24:31.000]  they had on his jet. Let's liken the
[24:31.000 --> 24:33.000]  portal girls, mainly little girls, to
[24:33.000 --> 24:35.000]  peanuts.
[24:35.000 --> 24:37.000]  He had peanuts on board his Lolita Express,
[24:37.000 --> 24:39.000]  but he's a peanut farmer.
[24:41.000 --> 24:43.000]  Just in one county in Florida,
[24:43.000 --> 24:45.000]  he was recruiting up to 200 girls
[24:45.000 --> 24:47.000]  a year that they knew of
[24:47.000 --> 24:49.000]  in one county. He had
[24:49.000 --> 24:51.000]  farms all over.
[24:51.000 --> 24:53.000]  The man
[24:55.000 --> 24:57.000]  was a tycoon
[24:57.000 --> 24:59.000]  of farming
[24:59.000 --> 25:01.000]  underage girls.
[25:01.000 --> 25:03.000]  That's what he did
[25:03.000 --> 25:05.000]  on an industrial scale.
[25:07.000 --> 25:09.000]  And the ones they had in front of the
[25:09.000 --> 25:11.000]  Secret Service and the ones they had
[25:11.000 --> 25:13.000]  at the airfields were all
[25:13.000 --> 25:15.000]  16, 17, 18 who'd been grabbed
[25:15.000 --> 25:17.000]  when they were 10, 11, 12 years old
[25:17.000 --> 25:19.000]  and trained, and that's why you got
[25:19.000 --> 25:21.000]  Bill Clinton and Kevin Spacey and all this
[25:21.000 --> 25:23.000]  scum on board the aircraft because
[25:23.000 --> 25:25.000]  that's what they're doing and that's who
[25:25.000 --> 25:27.000]  they are, but it's come out in the
[25:27.000 --> 25:29.000]  Caribbean around little St. John's
[25:29.000 --> 25:31.000]  and the nearby islands that
[25:31.000 --> 25:33.000]  little kids being brought in
[25:35.000 --> 25:37.000]  and you know the little Caribbean
[25:37.000 --> 25:39.000]  kids, nobody knows where they go
[25:39.000 --> 25:41.000]  and a lot of them end up dead.
[25:41.000 --> 25:43.000]  So I'm just going to explain this again.
[25:43.000 --> 25:45.000]  They're murdering the children.
[25:47.000 --> 25:49.000]  They've got the
[25:49.000 --> 25:51.000]  Eastern European women
[25:51.000 --> 25:53.000]  to lure other girls
[25:53.000 --> 25:55.000]  and that's what they do
[25:55.000 --> 25:57.000]  and that's come out so
[25:57.000 --> 25:59.000]  the reason I'm not
[25:59.000 --> 26:01.000]  covering this at the start of the show
[26:01.000 --> 26:03.000]  and the reason I always kind of start covering
[26:03.000 --> 26:05.000]  something and then stop is I go wait a minute
[26:05.000 --> 26:07.000]  I shouldn't just go from memory on this.
[26:07.000 --> 26:09.000]  I've got a big folder we put together a month
[26:09.000 --> 26:11.000]  ago from past research about that thick
[26:11.000 --> 26:13.000]  somewhere here in the office we can find it
[26:13.000 --> 26:15.000]  and
[26:15.000 --> 26:17.000]  we've got congressional hearings
[26:17.000 --> 26:19.000]  with the Dinecore information.
[26:19.000 --> 26:21.000]  We've got them admitting it. We've got
[26:21.000 --> 26:23.000]  Donald Rumsfeld
[26:23.000 --> 26:25.000]  being asked by Congress people about
[26:25.000 --> 26:27.000]  thousands of women and children kidnapped
[26:27.000 --> 26:29.000]  out by Dinecore alone
[26:29.000 --> 26:31.000]  and now they only got a small fine
[26:31.000 --> 26:33.000]  and he says, yeah, they're allowed
[26:33.000 --> 26:35.000]  to operate, they paid their fine.
[26:35.000 --> 26:37.000]  Do you understand
[26:37.000 --> 26:39.000]  that the media is covering this up?
[26:43.000 --> 26:45.000]  Thousands, 2,000
[26:47.000 --> 26:49.000]  Haitian children out of
[26:49.000 --> 26:51.000]  tens of thousands that were taken out of Haiti
[26:51.000 --> 26:53.000]  by the Clintons, by their foundation head
[26:53.000 --> 26:57.000]  ended up dead.
[26:57.000 --> 26:59.000]  And I could sit here and show you the AP
[26:59.000 --> 27:01.000]  report but AP got no coverage.
[27:01.000 --> 27:03.000]  AP put the report out
[27:03.000 --> 27:05.000]  3 years ago.
[27:05.000 --> 27:07.000]  We went there with Gary Haven
[27:11.000 --> 27:13.000]  billionaire philanthropist
[27:13.000 --> 27:15.000]  who was doing daily food deliveries there
[27:15.000 --> 27:17.000]  after the hurricane and broke all that information
[27:17.000 --> 27:23.000]  and basically forced the AP story out.
[27:23.000 --> 27:25.000]  So
[27:25.000 --> 27:27.000]  people go, oh man, you've been vindicated.
[27:27.000 --> 27:29.000]  Bill Clinton's on this airplane with underage girls.
[27:29.000 --> 27:33.000]  Give me a break folks. I don't want to be vindicated.
[27:33.000 --> 27:35.000]  I want to stop these people.
[27:35.000 --> 27:37.000]  The very groups running this
[27:37.000 --> 27:39.000]  are financing attacks
[27:39.000 --> 27:41.000]  on us and attempts to shut us down
[27:41.000 --> 27:43.000]  in dirty tricks everywhere
[27:43.000 --> 27:45.000]  because this isn't just Catholic
[27:45.000 --> 27:47.000]  priests
[27:47.000 --> 27:49.000]  raping little boys which is terrible.
[27:49.000 --> 27:51.000]  This is
[27:51.000 --> 27:53.000]  kidnapping children
[27:53.000 --> 27:55.000]  all over the world
[27:57.000 --> 27:59.000]  and the
[27:59.000 --> 28:01.000]  market for little girls
[28:01.000 --> 28:03.000]  is
[28:03.000 --> 28:05.000]  I would say 20 times that little boys.
[28:07.000 --> 28:09.000]  Now you just remember that.
[28:09.000 --> 28:11.000]  They told you about the Catholic church stuff
[28:11.000 --> 28:13.000]  because they were blackmailing the Catholic church
[28:13.000 --> 28:15.000]  with their devil pope in
[28:15.000 --> 28:17.000]  using that blackmail and that's why
[28:17.000 --> 28:19.000]  all his top people are now getting busted
[28:19.000 --> 28:21.000]  because the other groups are coming at
[28:21.000 --> 28:23.000]  for them and exposing it.
[28:23.000 --> 28:25.000]  And I'm not even here to defend the Catholic church.
[28:25.000 --> 28:27.000]  I'm just saying that's one little subset
[28:27.000 --> 28:29.000]  of this cult.
[28:29.000 --> 28:31.000]  So I'm going to
[28:31.000 --> 28:33.000]  pull some of those articles and show you the articles.
[28:33.000 --> 28:35.000]  Hell, I should show congressional clips.
[28:35.000 --> 28:37.000]  And that's how I knew about Jeffrey Epstein
[28:37.000 --> 28:39.000]  because he was the one running
[28:39.000 --> 28:41.000]  some of the aircraft.
[28:41.000 --> 28:43.000]  He had girls that worked for him
[28:43.000 --> 28:45.000]  who ran companies for him
[28:45.000 --> 28:47.000]  that do run companies for them
[28:47.000 --> 28:49.000]  that were kidnapped out of Europe
[28:49.000 --> 28:51.000]  when they were 10, 11, 12 years old
[28:51.000 --> 28:53.000]  or bought from their parents.
[28:53.000 --> 28:55.000]  That's how
[28:55.000 --> 29:15.000]  this is going to be.
[29:26.000 --> 29:28.000]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program
[29:28.000 --> 29:30.000]  to replace your old habits with new habits
[29:30.000 --> 29:32.000]  and totally change your life.
[29:32.000 --> 29:34.000]  And if you have PPO,
[29:34.000 --> 29:36.000]  private health insurance,
[29:36.000 --> 29:38.000]  the entire program may be covered.
[29:38.000 --> 29:40.000]  Fix your problem right now
[29:40.000 --> 29:42.000]  before it gets any worse. Get clean.
[29:42.000 --> 29:59.000]  Call now and learn more.
[29:59.000 --> 30:01.000]  You want to break some globalist ribs.
[30:01.000 --> 30:03.000]  You want to crush some skulls politically.
[30:03.000 --> 30:06.000]  You want to drive ice picks through their eyeballs spiritually.
[30:06.000 --> 30:08.000]  There's nowhere you can spend money.
[30:08.000 --> 30:11.000]  There's nowhere you can place your bet.
[30:11.000 --> 30:13.000]  In a fight where it's going to have more
[30:13.000 --> 30:15.000]  power per dollar.
[30:15.000 --> 30:17.000]  You're bang for your buck here.
[30:17.000 --> 30:19.000]  Get you great products at great prices
[30:19.000 --> 30:21.000]  that literally fund
[30:21.000 --> 30:23.000]  the system where the spirit of resistance lives
[30:23.000 --> 30:25.000]  to drive it home to the enemy.
[30:25.000 --> 30:27.000]  And so it's very simple.
[30:27.000 --> 30:29.000]  If you don't want to be slaves
[30:29.000 --> 30:31.000]  and you want to see the fight taken to the enemy,
[30:31.000 --> 30:33.000]  which God wants to see,
[30:33.000 --> 30:35.000]  we have to make the effort.
[30:35.000 --> 30:37.000]  110% God will finish the move.
[30:37.000 --> 30:39.000]  And I know I need to stay in the fight
[30:39.000 --> 30:41.000]  in the attack, attack, attack.
[30:41.000 --> 30:43.000]  I want to attack. I want to go after the globalist.
[30:43.000 --> 30:45.000]  And just believe me, ladies and gentlemen,
[30:45.000 --> 30:47.000]  that if you want somebody to commit to you and your family
[30:47.000 --> 30:49.000]  to fight for all of our futures together,
[30:49.000 --> 30:51.000]  you've got to guarantee you keep me in the game.
[30:51.000 --> 30:53.000]  I'm going to buzz my ass with everything I got
[30:53.000 --> 30:55.000]  for us, for myself and my family, for your family.
[30:55.000 --> 30:57.000]  Because we're in this together.
[30:57.000 --> 31:09.000]  I love watching David Knight in the morning.
[31:09.000 --> 31:11.000]  I love tuning in to Owen Schreuer.
[31:11.000 --> 31:13.000]  I love all the other shows we do here.
[31:13.000 --> 31:15.000]  But I'll be honest with you.
[31:15.000 --> 31:17.000]  We run during the breaks a lot of news reports
[31:17.000 --> 31:19.000]  because I'm sick of hearing the ads.
[31:19.000 --> 31:21.000]  So you think you don't want to hear an ad?
[31:21.000 --> 31:23.000]  I don't want to hear an ad.
[31:23.000 --> 31:25.000]  But here's the bottom line.
[31:25.000 --> 31:27.000]  If we sell enough product, we'll have less ads
[31:27.000 --> 31:29.000]  and less plugs.
[31:29.000 --> 31:31.000]  And we'll expand and really give the globalists
[31:31.000 --> 31:33.000]  rough their money.
[31:33.000 --> 31:35.000]  But we've got products you already really need,
[31:35.000 --> 31:37.000]  like DNA Force Plus, X2.
[31:37.000 --> 31:39.000]  These will change your life.
[31:39.000 --> 31:41.000]  Go check out the turmeric products.
[31:41.000 --> 31:43.000]  Check out the water filtration, air filtration.
[31:43.000 --> 31:45.000]  Check it all out. Whatever you do, take action and know.
[31:45.000 --> 31:47.000]  Be part of the Second American Revolution.
[31:47.000 --> 31:49.000]  Be part of Crush the Globalist.
[31:49.000 --> 31:51.000]  And get great products at the same time.
[31:51.000 --> 31:53.000]  Infowarsstore.com is the umbrella site.
[31:53.000 --> 31:55.000]  And fund the Infowark for your own future.
[32:23.000 --> 32:25.000]  These products are really amazing.
[32:25.000 --> 32:27.000]  You've got that pledge from me,
[32:27.000 --> 32:29.000]  but you've seen the third-party test out there,
[32:29.000 --> 32:31.000]  the air filtration, the water filtration.
[32:31.000 --> 32:33.000]  The supplements are all the very best
[32:33.000 --> 32:35.000]  you're going to find out there.
[32:35.000 --> 32:37.000]  And you can't fund an operation anywhere else
[32:37.000 --> 32:40.000]  that's fighting the globalists this hard.
[32:40.000 --> 32:44.000]  So it's not a burden to support Infowars.
[32:44.000 --> 32:47.000]  It really is something that is good

[32:53.000 --> 32:55.000]  and your children's life so much better.

[33:26.000 --> 33:32.000]  President Trump, just about 35 minutes ago,
[33:32.000 --> 33:36.000]  was responding in a press conference
[33:36.000 --> 33:40.000]  to the idiocy of the impeachment.
[33:40.000 --> 33:43.000]  And, of course, the idea that the president
[33:43.000 --> 33:48.000]  cannot order someone killed in a war zone
[33:48.000 --> 33:52.000]  who has been on a terrorist list for 25 years.
[33:52.000 --> 33:57.000]  And who we know has killed thousands of U.S. troops.
[33:57.000 --> 33:58.000]  That's not debatable.
[33:58.000 --> 33:59.000]  They celebrated an Iran.
[33:59.000 --> 34:02.000]  They pioneered the IEDs.
[34:02.000 --> 34:05.000]  And even some IEDs with depleted uranium in them
[34:05.000 --> 34:07.000]  to even be able to pierce the Abrams tanks
[34:07.000 --> 34:10.000]  with a heavy armor and the reactive armor.
[34:10.000 --> 34:13.000]  And so whether you like the strike or not,
[34:13.000 --> 34:16.000]  the squad and the president
[34:16.000 --> 34:19.000]  are the ones that are going to fight the war.
[34:19.000 --> 34:23.000]  The squad and Pelosi and the Democrats
[34:23.000 --> 34:25.000]  have come out and aligned themselves.
[34:25.000 --> 34:29.000]  And Time Magazine has aligned themselves
[34:29.000 --> 34:34.000]  with Soleimani.
[34:34.000 --> 34:39.000]  And it's now emerged why Trump did this.
[34:39.000 --> 34:42.000]  It's clearly the Iranian mula was afraid
[34:42.000 --> 34:44.000]  of Soleimani's power growing.
[34:44.000 --> 34:47.000]  Iran couldn't make back channel deals
[34:47.000 --> 34:49.000]  with the United States.
[34:49.000 --> 34:52.000]  Trump was cutting off the deals that Obama had set up
[34:52.000 --> 34:57.000]  and the Ayatollah's father was put in by the CIA.
[34:57.000 --> 34:59.000]  They're not really controlled by them today,
[34:59.000 --> 35:01.000]  but they green lit.
[35:01.000 --> 35:04.000]  The Iranians knew Soleimani was going to be killed.
[35:04.000 --> 35:08.000]  And they also called an hour before
[35:08.000 --> 35:10.000]  and told the Pentagon they were going to watch missiles
[35:10.000 --> 35:13.000]  at that base as Kabuki theater
[35:13.000 --> 35:17.000]  so that they wouldn't have an uprising in Tehran.
[35:17.000 --> 35:20.000]  And I had Steve Pachinic on his face kind of blush
[35:20.000 --> 35:23.000]  when I brought that up because he's got a lot of Pentagon sources.
[35:23.000 --> 35:26.000]  And he said that's basically the word of what's going on,
[35:26.000 --> 35:29.000]  but he doesn't want to embarrass the Ayatollah.
[35:29.000 --> 35:33.000]  So that's why he said,
[35:33.000 --> 35:36.000]  I did this to stop a war because the Quds forces
[35:36.000 --> 35:38.000]  are taking over the Middle East.
[35:38.000 --> 35:40.000]  And you want to get out of the Middle East?
[35:40.000 --> 35:43.000]  Then you need to have them stop and then have NATO
[35:43.000 --> 35:46.000]  be brought in and be invited into the Strait of Hormuz
[35:46.000 --> 35:49.000]  and other areas for security and then we don't pay for it anymore.
[35:49.000 --> 35:51.000]  Just like Trump wants us to be energy independent,
[35:51.000 --> 35:54.000]  the biggest exporter in the world, we are now.
[35:54.000 --> 35:57.000]  Just by taking the ball and chains off.
[35:57.000 --> 36:01.000]  So very sophisticated 3D chess, 4D chess,
[36:01.000 --> 36:03.000]  and Trump's done it.
[36:03.000 --> 36:06.000]  And so far it's been a master stroke,
[36:06.000 --> 36:08.000]  unlike anything we've ever seen.
[36:08.000 --> 36:11.000]  And I don't like endorsing military action because it usually goes bad,
[36:11.000 --> 36:16.000]  but this is pretty amazing.
[36:16.000 --> 36:19.000]  Just like Trump's getting us out of Syria, Afghanistan,
[36:19.000 --> 36:22.000]  this is the real deal, at least so far.
[36:22.000 --> 36:25.000]  But the Democrats trying to trap him and say,
[36:25.000 --> 36:27.000]  you don't have the power to build a wall
[36:27.000 --> 36:29.000]  when that's in the Constitution.
[36:29.000 --> 36:31.000]  It's not even a law, it's in the Constitution, the Supreme Law.
[36:31.000 --> 36:34.000]  I mean, it's written into the code.
[36:34.000 --> 36:37.000]  And the appeals courts ruled Trump's right on that.
[36:37.000 --> 36:41.000]  They're trying to basically take any power the President has the way
[36:41.000 --> 36:44.000]  because in the past, presidents have been puppets for a long time.
[36:44.000 --> 36:47.000]  So here's what President Trump just said
[36:47.000 --> 36:50.000]  about an hour ago or 45 minutes ago or so,
[36:50.000 --> 36:53.000]  and then we'll get to Pelosi and what he was responding to.
[36:53.000 --> 36:54.000]  Here he is.
[36:54.000 --> 36:56.000]  There probably was none,
[36:56.000 --> 36:58.000]  or maybe we know who the second whistleblower was.
[36:58.000 --> 36:59.000]  Maybe we do.
[36:59.000 --> 37:00.000]  But he never showed up.
[37:00.000 --> 37:01.000]  All of a sudden they don't talk
[37:01.000 --> 37:04.000]  because they were really unexpectedly met
[37:04.000 --> 37:07.000]  with the actual conversation, the exact conversation.
[37:07.000 --> 37:10.000]  So yeah, if we do that, I would like to have those people,
[37:10.000 --> 37:13.000]  plus others testify, because it's the greatest hoax
[37:13.000 --> 37:16.000]  ever perpetrated on the United States government.
[37:16.000 --> 37:20.000]  This has gone on since the day I came down the escalator.
[37:20.000 --> 37:21.000]  This isn't just here.
[37:21.000 --> 37:23.000]  This isn't just the Ukraine hoax.
[37:23.000 --> 37:25.000]  This is the witch hunt.
[37:25.000 --> 37:27.000]  This is the whole thing with Russia.
[37:27.000 --> 37:30.000]  That turned out to be a total fabricated plot.
[37:30.000 --> 37:33.000]  The ones who were guilty are the Democrats, the DNC,
[37:33.000 --> 37:36.000]  and all of the dirty cops that were involved.
[37:36.000 --> 37:37.000]  That we caught.
[37:37.000 --> 37:38.000]  Yeah.
[37:38.000 --> 37:41.000]  Mr. President, I sure saw Mike Lee's comments.
[37:41.000 --> 37:43.000]  Did your national security team really say
[37:43.000 --> 37:45.000]  that it would be wrong for Congress
[37:45.000 --> 37:47.000]  to debate military action around it?
[37:47.000 --> 37:49.000]  So here's what happened on that.
[37:49.000 --> 37:51.000]  I had calls from numerous senators
[37:51.000 --> 37:53.000]  and numerous congressmen and women
[37:53.000 --> 37:56.000]  saying it was the greatest presentation they've ever had.
[37:56.000 --> 37:58.000]  Mike and Rand Paul disagreed
[37:58.000 --> 38:00.000]  because they want information
[38:00.000 --> 38:02.000]  that honestly I think is very hard to get.
[38:02.000 --> 38:04.000]  It's okay if the military wants to give it,
[38:04.000 --> 38:06.000]  but they didn't want to give it.
[38:06.000 --> 38:08.000]  And it really had to do with sources
[38:08.000 --> 38:10.000]  and information that we had
[38:10.000 --> 38:13.000]  that really should remain at a very high level.
[38:13.000 --> 38:15.000]  Could we individually maybe give one or two of them
[38:15.000 --> 38:18.000]  some information possibly if we can do that?
[38:18.000 --> 38:20.000]  I get along great with Mike Lee.
[38:20.000 --> 38:22.000]  I've never seen him like that.
[38:22.000 --> 38:24.000]  But other people have called and they've said
[38:24.000 --> 38:26.000]  it was the best presentation they've ever seen.
[38:26.000 --> 38:28.000]  And let me tell you what was the best.
[38:28.000 --> 38:30.000]  Forget about presentation, the result.
[38:30.000 --> 38:33.000]  We killed a man who killed many, many Americans
[38:33.000 --> 38:37.000]  and many, many people, thousands and thousands of people.
[38:37.000 --> 38:39.000]  And when I go over to Walter Reed
[38:39.000 --> 38:42.000]  and I meet these young, incredible folks,
[38:42.000 --> 38:46.000]  mostly, it just seems, mostly men, but also women,
[38:46.000 --> 38:49.000]  where their legs are gone, their arms are gone.
[38:49.000 --> 38:51.000]  In some cases, both the legs and the arms are gone
[38:51.000 --> 38:54.000]  and the face and the body is badly damaged.
[38:54.000 --> 38:57.000]  And frankly, five years ago they couldn't have lived
[38:57.000 --> 39:00.000]  and today they can live because of the wonders of medicine
[39:00.000 --> 39:03.000]  and the wonders of Walter Reed and the people over there,
[39:03.000 --> 39:05.000]  the job they do, the medical doctors.
[39:05.000 --> 39:07.000]  But I will say this.
[39:07.000 --> 39:11.000]  We caught a total monster and we took them out
[39:11.000 --> 39:14.000]  and that should have happened a long time ago.
[39:14.000 --> 39:18.000]  We did it because they were looking to blow up our embassy.
[39:18.000 --> 39:21.000]  We also did it for other reasons that were very obvious.
[39:21.000 --> 39:25.000]  Somebody died, one of our military people died.
[39:25.000 --> 39:29.000]  People were badly wounded just a week before and we did it.
[39:29.000 --> 39:31.000]  And we had a shot at them and I took it
[39:31.000 --> 39:33.000]  and that shot was pinpoint accurate
[39:33.000 --> 39:35.000]  and that was the end of a monster.
[39:35.000 --> 39:38.000]  Then, and that was really, that was the second attack.
[39:38.000 --> 39:40.000]  It was not, we didn't start it.
[39:40.000 --> 39:42.000]  They started by killing one of our people
[39:42.000 --> 39:45.000]  and wounding badly other of our people.
[39:45.000 --> 39:47.000]  So that you call retribution.
[39:47.000 --> 39:50.000]  Ukraine, if you look at what happened with Ukraine,
[39:50.000 --> 39:51.000]  that's a hoax.
[39:51.000 --> 39:53.000]  Well, this is a hoax too.
[39:53.000 --> 39:57.000]  Iran went in and they hit us with missiles.
[39:57.000 --> 39:59.000]  Shouldn't have done that, but they hit us.
[39:59.000 --> 40:03.000]  Fortunately for them, nobody was hurt.
[40:03.000 --> 40:05.000]  Nobody was killed.
[40:05.000 --> 40:06.000]  Nothing happened.
[40:06.000 --> 40:09.000]  They landed very little damage even to the base.
[40:09.000 --> 40:10.000]  All right.
[40:10.000 --> 40:11.000]  So the president goes on from there
[40:11.000 --> 40:13.000]  and I'm just going to tell you,
[40:13.000 --> 40:15.000]  and I was already saying this before it came out in the news.
[40:15.000 --> 40:19.000]  I said, they called and said the missiles were coming.
[40:19.000 --> 40:22.000]  Just like Trump called Russia and said the missiles were coming
[40:22.000 --> 40:24.000]  a couple of years ago,
[40:24.000 --> 40:29.000]  because the hoax were going to make Trump stay in Syria.
[40:29.000 --> 40:33.000]  Well, now that's not happening, is it?
[40:33.000 --> 40:35.000]  And Russia is coming in and NATO is coming in
[40:35.000 --> 40:37.000]  as a joint force to police it.
[40:37.000 --> 40:40.000]  Trump's doing exactly what he said he would do.
[40:40.000 --> 40:44.000]  And so it's Kabuki theater, ladies and gentlemen.
[40:44.000 --> 40:49.000]  And Soleimani was not playing along with it.
[40:49.000 --> 40:52.000]  And he's dead.
[40:52.000 --> 40:55.000]  And this show is about the reality of the world.
[40:55.000 --> 40:57.000]  It's not about how we want it to be.
[40:57.000 --> 40:59.000]  We're trying to make it the way we want it to be.
[40:59.000 --> 41:02.000]  This is what's going on.
[41:02.000 --> 41:08.000]  And the codes forces were running Iran
[41:08.000 --> 41:10.000]  and they were starting to run the molas
[41:10.000 --> 41:13.000]  and the molas were very scared of Soleimani.
[41:13.000 --> 41:15.000]  And that's why you're seeing all this.
[41:15.000 --> 41:17.000]  That's why you see the eye total flipping out
[41:17.000 --> 41:19.000]  like he's upset.
[41:19.000 --> 41:21.000]  You know that it was telegraphed.
[41:21.000 --> 41:23.000]  Hey, we're going to take him out new policy
[41:23.000 --> 41:25.000]  and you guys want to make some deals.
[41:25.000 --> 41:27.000]  And now Trump says, hey, let's make a deal.
[41:27.000 --> 41:29.000]  Now that Soleimani's out of the way, he's told you
[41:29.000 --> 41:32.000]  what they're doing.
[41:32.000 --> 41:35.000]  And it can only be done because President Trump's in command
[41:35.000 --> 41:37.000]  before it was all these globalist boards
[41:37.000 --> 41:39.000]  and Iranian codes forces,
[41:39.000 --> 41:42.000]  paying off Kerry and his family
[41:42.000 --> 41:46.000]  and Hillary's girlfriend.
[41:46.000 --> 41:47.000]  Not the case anymore.
[41:47.000 --> 41:51.000]  Here's Daughtering Pelosi
[41:51.000 --> 41:53.000]  siding with Iran,
[41:53.000 --> 41:55.000]  siding with the codes forces
[41:55.000 --> 41:57.000]  and trying to act like Trump's power grabbing.
[41:57.000 --> 41:59.000]  Here it is.
[41:59.000 --> 42:04.000]  Many of your members have raised serious concerns about
[42:04.000 --> 42:06.000]  the timing of the strike against Soleimani,
[42:06.000 --> 42:08.000]  the administration's justification.
[42:08.000 --> 42:09.000]  You've been briefed.
[42:09.000 --> 42:11.000]  Do you think that the administration misled
[42:11.000 --> 42:14.000]  the American people about an imminent attack?
[42:14.000 --> 42:18.000]  I think that it's very unfortunate that right now,
[42:18.000 --> 42:20.000]  because I was briefed in the gang of eight
[42:20.000 --> 42:24.000]  and I was briefed in the, what do they call it,
[42:24.000 --> 42:28.000]  demeaning and worst classified briefing
[42:28.000 --> 42:31.000]  that the Republican senators ever heard yesterday.
[42:31.000 --> 42:35.000]  So at this point in terms of what is in the public domain,
[42:35.000 --> 42:40.000]  difficult to address some of what they contended.
[42:40.000 --> 42:44.000]  However, I will say this because I was informed
[42:44.000 --> 42:46.000]  by phone calls I mentioned to you earlier,
[42:46.000 --> 42:48.000]  I think I did anyway,
[42:48.000 --> 42:54.000]  that when I was briefed by the Secretary of Defense.
[42:54.000 --> 42:55.000]  We'll be back with more of this,
[42:55.000 --> 42:58.000]  then I'm going to shift gears into the latest.

[43:59.000 --> 44:01.000]  for the InfoWars, but I know you're like me.
[44:01.000 --> 44:03.000]  You don't want my thanks.
[44:03.000 --> 44:05.000]  You want victory over the globalist
[44:05.000 --> 44:07.000]  and these devil worship and child molesters,
[44:07.000 --> 44:10.000]  and you want them off your back and off your children's back.
[44:10.000 --> 44:11.000]  And you know what? I'm the same way,
[44:11.000 --> 44:14.000]  and that's why we're on the same damn team.
[44:14.000 --> 44:17.000]  And it's why InfoWars has been delivering time and time again
[44:17.000 --> 44:21.000]  when it's clutch time to focus the people
[44:21.000 --> 44:23.000]  on taking action against the globalist,
[44:23.000 --> 44:27.000]  because I'm committed to a future for humanity,
[44:27.000 --> 44:29.000]  and I know you are as well.
[44:29.000 --> 44:31.000]  So thank you in 2019 for standing with us
[44:31.000 --> 44:33.000]  because you are the InfoWars,
[44:33.000 --> 44:35.000]  and I want to thank you for committing to stand with us
[44:35.000 --> 44:37.000]  in 2020 however you can.
[44:37.000 --> 44:39.000]  For the bottom of my heart, for my family,
[44:39.000 --> 44:41.000]  and for the great crew at InfoWars,
[44:41.000 --> 44:43.000]  I want to thank you all because you are the InfoWars,
[44:43.000 --> 44:46.000]  and you know that's not just words, that's reality.
[44:46.000 --> 44:48.000]  You have made history.
[44:48.000 --> 44:50.000]  We have made history together.
[44:50.000 --> 44:54.000]  InfoWars.com only has power because of you,
[44:54.000 --> 44:58.000]  and I suggest you use it.
[44:58.000 --> 45:01.000]  It's either happened to every person listening
[45:01.000 --> 45:04.000]  or it's happened to someone you know.
[45:04.000 --> 45:07.000]  Everybody is well aware of the fact
[45:07.000 --> 45:10.000]  that most people that end up getting the flu
[45:10.000 --> 45:14.000]  have taken the flu vaccine right before they get it,
[45:14.000 --> 45:18.000]  and that they get the worst case of the flu of their life.
[45:18.000 --> 45:22.000]  But still, like concentration camp victims,
[45:22.000 --> 45:25.000]  they line up at the different pharmacies
[45:25.000 --> 45:27.000]  and clinics to get the injections.
[45:27.000 --> 45:29.000]  It doesn't matter that studies,
[45:29.000 --> 45:32.000]  mainline government studies in Canada and Europe show
[45:32.000 --> 45:34.000]  that when you take the flu vaccine,
[45:34.000 --> 45:37.000]  it doubles your chances of getting the flu the next season
[45:37.000 --> 45:39.000]  by lowering your immunity.
[45:39.000 --> 45:41.000]  It goes on and on.
[45:41.000 --> 45:43.000]  Or the fact that the governments have never guessed
[45:43.000 --> 45:45.000]  the next year's mutation,
[45:45.000 --> 45:49.000]  that the flu vaccine has never, ever even worked.
[45:49.000 --> 45:51.000]  But how do you prop up a hoax?
[45:51.000 --> 45:53.000]  You keep the giant hoax going.
[45:53.000 --> 45:55.000]  No wonder we've got one of the worst flu seasons
[45:55.000 --> 45:58.000]  on record happening right now.
[45:58.000 --> 46:00.000]  If you understand why the globalist,
[46:00.000 --> 46:03.000]  why the servants of Satan hate info wars,
[46:03.000 --> 46:06.000]  it's because we're awake, we're alive,
[46:06.000 --> 46:10.000]  we're passionate, and we're not giving up.
[46:10.000 --> 46:13.000]  That's why it's critical for those of us that are aware
[46:13.000 --> 46:15.000]  of the New World Order's plans
[46:15.000 --> 46:17.000]  to not get down when they attack us
[46:17.000 --> 46:19.000]  and they persecute us and they lie about us.
[46:19.000 --> 46:21.000]  That's what we should expect
[46:21.000 --> 46:24.000]  because we are hurting these scumbags.
[46:24.000 --> 46:27.000]  The globalists have literally sold their souls to the dark side
[46:27.000 --> 46:30.000]  and they do what they do because they're slaves
[46:30.000 --> 46:33.000]  because they are eternally driven to try to suppress
[46:33.000 --> 46:36.000]  and dominate and destroy the innocent.
[46:36.000 --> 46:38.000]  It is up to us who are awake,
[46:38.000 --> 46:40.000]  not the sheep and not the wolves,
[46:40.000 --> 46:43.000]  but the sheepdogs to stand firm
[46:43.000 --> 46:46.000]  and resist these wicked tyrants.
[46:46.000 --> 46:48.000]  They fear the fact that we are awake.
[46:48.000 --> 46:51.000]  They fear the fact that we are alive.
[46:51.000 --> 46:54.000]  They fear the fact that we love God
[46:54.000 --> 46:56.000]  and that's all we ever have to know
[46:56.000 --> 47:25.000]  is that God is in charge.
[47:26.000 --> 47:30.000]  I know what they'll find.
[47:30.000 --> 47:32.000]  It's in their mind.
[47:32.000 --> 47:35.000]  It's what they want to see.
[47:35.000 --> 47:38.000]  Bear me from the rain.
[47:38.000 --> 47:42.000]  Here comes the night and here I'll stay.
[47:42.000 --> 47:44.000]  Waiting for death, yes.
[47:44.000 --> 47:47.000]  Until the angel of death came
[47:47.000 --> 47:49.000]  into Pharaoh's Egypt
[47:49.000 --> 47:51.000]  to when God sent the grim reaper
[47:51.000 --> 47:53.000]  to take the firstborn
[47:53.000 --> 47:56.000]  of Pharaoh
[47:56.000 --> 47:59.000]  for Egypt's attack on God's children.
[47:59.000 --> 48:02.000]  Waiting for darkness.
[48:02.000 --> 48:05.000]  It's evil that fears the dark.
[48:05.000 --> 48:07.000]  I know what they'll find.
[48:07.000 --> 48:09.000]  I know what they'll find.
[48:09.000 --> 48:11.000]  It's in their mind.
[48:11.000 --> 48:13.000]  It's in their mind.
[48:13.000 --> 48:15.000]  It's in their mind.
[48:15.000 --> 48:17.000]  It's in their mind.
[48:17.000 --> 48:19.000]  It's in their mind.
[48:19.000 --> 48:23.000]  I know what they'll find.
[48:23.000 --> 48:25.000]  It's in their mind.
[48:25.000 --> 48:27.000]  It's what they want to see.
[48:27.000 --> 48:29.000]  Bear me from the rain.
[48:29.000 --> 48:32.000]  Here comes the night and here I'll stay.
[48:32.000 --> 48:34.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[48:34.000 --> 48:37.000]  we are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[48:37.000 --> 48:39.000]  I am your host, Alan Jones,
[48:39.000 --> 48:41.000]  here live on air because of you
[48:41.000 --> 48:44.000]  and your support in defiance
[48:44.000 --> 48:46.000]  to globalist tyrants.
[48:46.000 --> 48:49.000]  Now, the Democrats
[48:49.000 --> 48:51.000]  and the globalist
[48:51.000 --> 48:53.000]  have an agenda and a mission
[48:53.000 --> 48:55.000]  to disarm the people
[48:55.000 --> 48:57.000]  so that they can turn the entire country
[48:57.000 --> 49:00.000]  into models of south side Chicago
[49:00.000 --> 49:02.000]  and in the worst areas of DC
[49:02.000 --> 49:04.000]  with massive crime narcotics
[49:04.000 --> 49:06.000]  that the globalist control,
[49:06.000 --> 49:09.000]  the homeless laying around dying on fennel.
[49:09.000 --> 49:12.000]  They can't stand the fact that in
[49:12.000 --> 49:14.000]  red cities and red towns
[49:14.000 --> 49:19.000]  and red farms and red ranches
[49:19.000 --> 49:21.000]  in the heartland of this country
[49:21.000 --> 49:23.000]  and all the points between
[49:23.000 --> 49:25.000]  from North Carolina
[49:25.000 --> 49:27.000]  to South Alabama
[49:27.000 --> 49:29.000]  and little towns all across this land
[49:29.000 --> 49:32.000]  to quote Hank Williams Jr.
[49:35.000 --> 49:37.000]  And so instead of just creeping around
[49:37.000 --> 49:39.000]  denying that they want our guys
[49:39.000 --> 49:42.000]  want to play a compilation here in a moment,
[49:42.000 --> 49:45.000]  they're now out in the open
[49:45.000 --> 49:47.000]  because they want to desensitize this
[49:47.000 --> 49:49.000]  to the idea of gun confiscation
[49:49.000 --> 49:52.000]  and they want to set up confrontations
[49:52.000 --> 49:54.000]  in places like Virginia
[49:54.000 --> 49:55.000]  to trigger a civil war
[49:55.000 --> 49:56.000]  and that's now confirmed.
[49:56.000 --> 49:58.000]  That's their ballgame.
[49:58.000 --> 50:00.000]  Democrats admit to national gun confiscation plan
[50:00.000 --> 50:02.000]  incredibly powerful report
[50:02.000 --> 50:04.000]  that went out yesterday afternoon
[50:04.000 --> 50:08.000]  to ban.video and infowars.com
[50:08.000 --> 50:10.000]  and I'm asking the crew
[50:10.000 --> 50:12.000]  that posted as the featured video
[50:12.000 --> 50:15.000]  on band.video so everybody can find it easily
[50:15.000 --> 50:17.000]  and share it
[50:17.000 --> 50:20.000]  and hopefully others can post this
[50:20.000 --> 50:23.000]  on YouTube and Facebook and Twitter
[50:23.000 --> 50:25.000]  because it doesn't have the evil Alex Jones on it.
[50:25.000 --> 50:26.000]  Maybe it won't get blocked
[50:26.000 --> 50:28.000]  but that's how these videos get out
[50:28.000 --> 50:30.000]  is you posting them folks and you sharing them
[50:30.000 --> 50:32.000]  and I know the main listeners know that
[50:32.000 --> 50:34.000]  and do that but we have new listeners every second
[50:34.000 --> 50:36.000]  that's just so critical.
[50:36.000 --> 50:37.000]  Our message will win.
[50:37.000 --> 50:39.000]  That's why they're censoring it.
[50:39.000 --> 50:40.000]  We just get past the censors.
[50:40.000 --> 50:41.000]  We win.
[50:41.000 --> 50:42.000]  That's the whole mission.
[50:42.000 --> 50:45.000]  You're everything.
[50:45.000 --> 50:49.000]  Infowars kind of just created the ball
[50:49.000 --> 50:50.000]  but you're the field.
[50:50.000 --> 50:51.000]  You're the players.
[50:51.000 --> 50:52.000]  You're the whole thing.
[50:52.000 --> 50:53.000]  You're the game.
[50:53.000 --> 50:55.000]  You're the whole shooting match
[50:55.000 --> 51:03.000]  when you carry the info across the finish line.
[51:03.000 --> 51:05.000]  So look at these latest articles.
[51:05.000 --> 51:06.000]  It's official.
[51:06.000 --> 51:10.000]  Colorado's red flag gun confiscations begin.
[51:10.000 --> 51:12.000]  Kellan McBrane article in FullWars.com
[51:12.000 --> 51:15.000]  a whole bunch of examples of legal lawful people
[51:15.000 --> 51:17.000]  with no criminal record have done nothing.
[51:17.000 --> 51:20.000]  They just take their guns.
[51:20.000 --> 51:22.000]  President Democrat introduces new gun
[51:22.000 --> 51:24.000]  and ammo bans to kick off the year.
[51:24.000 --> 51:29.000]  Registration, ammo bans, gun shooting range bans.
[51:29.000 --> 51:31.000]  It's just unbelievable.
[51:31.000 --> 51:35.000]  Well of course a bunch of crooks want their quarry,
[51:35.000 --> 51:36.000]  their slaves disarmed.
[51:36.000 --> 51:40.000]  And America knows that.
[51:40.000 --> 51:43.000]  And so they're just throwing down the gauntlet
[51:43.000 --> 51:48.000]  out of real desperation.
[51:48.000 --> 51:50.000]  But still they're dangerous.
[51:50.000 --> 51:53.000]  And still they're going to try to wind up
[51:53.000 --> 51:55.000]  crazy people to go out and copycat the media
[51:55.000 --> 51:57.000]  hyping up mass shootings but thank God
[51:57.000 --> 52:00.000]  more and more citizens are armed and ready
[52:00.000 --> 52:03.000]  and are shutting these terrible events down.
[52:03.000 --> 52:05.000]  It's a sickness of the mind.
[52:05.000 --> 52:07.000]  It's evil that we contend with.
[52:07.000 --> 52:09.000]  The gun is just a tool and I know you know that
[52:09.000 --> 52:14.000]  but it's just such a fight right now.
[52:14.000 --> 52:18.000]  So let's play this very important compilation.
[52:18.000 --> 52:20.000]  Some of these clips you've seen, some you haven't
[52:20.000 --> 52:22.000]  but really nobody's put them all together
[52:22.000 --> 52:24.000]  that I've seen in one place.
[52:24.000 --> 52:26.000]  And so this is only like three minutes long
[52:26.000 --> 52:29.000]  but it's critical.
[52:29.000 --> 52:31.000]  It is so important.
[52:31.000 --> 52:33.000]  We'll wake up so many people that we just don't let
[52:33.000 --> 52:36.000]  Beto and Hillary and Obama say
[52:36.000 --> 52:38.000]  we're going to take your guns and then move on
[52:38.000 --> 52:39.000]  like that's normal.
[52:39.000 --> 52:41.000]  We have to remember that that's who they are
[52:41.000 --> 52:42.000]  and that's what they want.
[52:42.000 --> 52:43.000]  Because notice they said oh we're going to take your guns
[52:43.000 --> 52:44.000]  and oh we never said that.
[52:44.000 --> 52:45.000]  We're not going to take your guns.
[52:45.000 --> 52:47.000]  That's psychological techniques.
[52:47.000 --> 52:49.000]  They want to normalize it to young people
[52:49.000 --> 52:51.000]  and others. Here it is.
[52:51.000 --> 52:54.000]  If I could have gotten 51 votes
[52:54.000 --> 52:56.000]  in the Senate of the United States
[52:56.000 --> 52:59.000]  for an outright ban
[52:59.000 --> 53:01.000]  I would have seen up every one of them.
[53:01.000 --> 53:04.000]  Mr. and Mrs. America turn them all in.
[53:04.000 --> 53:05.000]  I would have done it.
[53:05.000 --> 53:08.000]  When they give us that inch, that bump stock ban
[53:08.000 --> 53:09.000]  we will take a mile.
[53:09.000 --> 53:12.000]  You've heard people say you'll have to pry my guns
[53:12.000 --> 53:15.000]  for my cold ban.
[53:15.000 --> 53:18.000]  Okay.
[53:18.000 --> 53:21.000]  We have introduced an assault weapons ban.
[53:21.000 --> 53:25.000]  I'm talking about a ban on assault rifles.
[53:25.000 --> 53:27.000]  If you listen real close
[53:27.000 --> 53:29.000]  you can hear the people in power shaking.
[53:29.000 --> 53:31.000]  It's not enough to simply have a catchy ad
[53:31.000 --> 53:34.000]  on a Monday and then only do it every Monday.
[53:34.000 --> 53:36.000]  We need to do this every day of the week
[53:36.000 --> 53:38.000]  and just really brainwash people into thinking
[53:38.000 --> 53:41.000]  about guns in a vastly different way.
[53:41.000 --> 53:43.000]  Enough. Enough. Enough.
[53:43.000 --> 53:46.000]  We say no more.
[53:46.000 --> 53:48.000]  I'm the guy that originally wrote the assault weapons ban
[53:48.000 --> 53:50.000]  that became law.
[53:50.000 --> 53:52.000]  A gentleman just walked up to me in his picture line.
[53:52.000 --> 53:55.000]  He says I have an AR-15 and I will turn this in
[53:55.000 --> 53:58.000]  if it means saving the lives of our kids.
[53:58.000 --> 54:01.000]  Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.
[54:01.000 --> 54:03.000]  We're not going to allow it to be used
[54:03.000 --> 54:06.000]  against our fellow Americans anymore.
[54:06.000 --> 54:09.000]  Do you think Trump is responsible for what happened?
[54:09.000 --> 54:12.000]  I said well look, I mean obviously he didn't pull the trigger
[54:12.000 --> 54:15.000]  but he's certainly been tweeting out the ammunition.
[54:15.000 --> 54:17.000]  I am incredibly saddened
[54:17.000 --> 54:24.000]  and it's very hard to think about this.
[54:24.000 --> 54:26.000]  I'm tired of hearing people all they have to offer is
[54:26.000 --> 54:28.000]  thoughts and prayers.
[54:28.000 --> 54:32.000]  In my faith, people say faith without works is dead.
[54:32.000 --> 54:35.000]  So we will find a way but the reason we have a problem right now
[54:35.000 --> 54:39.000]  is we've let the corporate gun lobby frame this debate.
[54:39.000 --> 54:42.000]  It is time that we have bold actions and a bold agenda.
[54:42.000 --> 54:44.000]  Over 90% of the American people think
[54:44.000 --> 54:47.000]  we have to get assault weapons off the street, period,
[54:47.000 --> 54:50.000]  and we have to get buybacks and get them out of their basements.
[54:50.000 --> 54:53.000]  Everyone up here favors an assault weapon ban.
[54:53.000 --> 54:57.000]  Everyone up here favors magazine limitations
[54:57.000 --> 54:59.000]  which by the way would have made a huge difference.
[54:59.000 --> 55:01.000]  We can ban the weapons of war.
[55:01.000 --> 55:04.000]  It's about ending the sales of assault weapons into our communities.
[55:04.000 --> 55:07.000]  Those weapons of war were designed to kill people as effectively
[55:07.000 --> 55:09.000]  and as efficiently as possible.
[55:09.000 --> 55:12.000]  They should belong on the battlefield and not in our communities.
[55:12.000 --> 55:14.000]  But I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree
[55:14.000 --> 55:20.000]  that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[55:20.000 --> 55:24.000]  By the way, you can't own the following weapons, period.
[55:24.000 --> 55:26.000]  They cannot be sold anymore.
[55:26.000 --> 55:29.000]  Like if you're going to take people's guns away, wait till you get elected,
[55:29.000 --> 55:31.000]  then take the guns away.
[55:31.000 --> 55:33.000]  Don't tell them ahead of time.
[55:33.000 --> 55:36.000]  Which by the way, that's what people like me think you're going to do.
[55:39.000 --> 55:42.000]  So there you go, Democrats admit to national gun confiscation plan.
[55:42.000 --> 55:46.000]  I'm going to give the number out now to take your calls in the next hour.
[55:46.000 --> 55:50.000]  On any of these subjects and topics, the war powers, the Iran strike, the economy.
[55:50.000 --> 55:57.000]  First round as first time callers, 877-789-ALEX, 877-789-2539.
[55:57.000 --> 56:00.000]  Again, 877-789-2539.
[56:00.000 --> 56:03.000]  If you're in Australia, I'm going to call in about the record fires.
[56:03.000 --> 56:07.000]  Whatever it is, whatever topic, it is a free-for-all today.
[56:07.000 --> 56:12.000]  877-789-2539.
[56:12.000 --> 56:17.000]  Now, the big official sale it says up on InfoWars is final hours.
[56:17.000 --> 56:19.000]  It said that for a day.
[56:19.000 --> 56:22.000]  I'm like four days behind taking the sale down at least.
[56:22.000 --> 56:25.000]  Just because I'll be honest with you.
[56:25.000 --> 56:28.000]  I just can't stop doing reports and working on news.
[56:28.000 --> 56:31.000]  It's just, it's just, it's just my total focus.
[56:31.000 --> 56:36.000]  So a lot of stuff sold out like X2,
[56:36.000 --> 56:43.000]  Supermobile Vitality, Ultimate Creole Oil, DNA Force Plus, Bodies, Turbo Force, Vita Mineral Fusion.
[56:43.000 --> 56:47.000]  So the sale is still technically there.
[56:47.000 --> 56:50.000]  But, and it's still a lot of great products.
[56:50.000 --> 56:53.000]  It's just not store-wide because a bunch of stuff's sold out
[56:53.000 --> 56:56.000]  and a lot of things that are about to sell out, we've put back to regular price.
[56:56.000 --> 57:00.000]  But still up at amazing sales, the Silver Bullet Coil, Silver to stock up, 9.95.
[57:00.000 --> 57:06.000]  Basil Beach, so good for your heart and cardiovascular system. Amazing. Concentrate on that.
[57:06.000 --> 57:09.000]  60% off. Alpha Power, 60% off.
[57:09.000 --> 57:12.000]  Stamina, libido, just energy, everything. Men and women.
[57:12.000 --> 57:17.000]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Original Toothpaste with Tea Tree Oil, Coil, Silver and Iodine.
[57:17.000 --> 57:20.000]  50% off. Super Silver Whitening Toothpaste.
[57:20.000 --> 57:23.000]  It also rememilarizes for the first time ever. 50% off.
[57:23.000 --> 57:26.000]  And Brain Force Plus, the great new Trubbix.
[57:26.000 --> 57:28.000]  60% off. Knockout, the sleep base. 60% off.
[57:28.000 --> 57:30.000]  Ultra 12, the best B12 we're going to find out there.
[57:30.000 --> 57:34.000]  Taking under the tongue. 60% off. Selenium, 60% off.
[57:34.000 --> 57:41.000]  All apparel, 25% off. But, again, this, this has got to be you today or tomorrow or the last day.
[57:41.000 --> 57:44.000]  But just so much stuff's going on behind the scenes here, having that time to do the sales.
[57:44.000 --> 57:48.000]  So this, this special is about the end. Thanks for your support.
[57:48.000 --> 57:53.000]  Sunday was supposed to be the last day that we could offer store-wide free shipping.
[57:53.000 --> 57:57.000]  Double Patriot points. It was 75% off with our big year in sale.
[57:57.000 --> 58:00.000]  Because a lot of the products have already sold out.
[58:00.000 --> 58:02.000]  Most of the others are about to sell out.
[58:02.000 --> 58:06.000]  But quite frankly, I've been working on so many big stories that are breaking right now
[58:06.000 --> 58:08.000]  that I have not come up with new specials.
[58:08.000 --> 58:11.000]  And we're already so close to selling out all these products
[58:11.000 --> 58:15.000]  that I'm just going to go ahead and keep the sale going for two more days.
[58:15.000 --> 58:19.000]  And we're going to basically sell out of all of our major product lines.
[58:19.000 --> 58:22.000]  It'll take weeks, months for them all to come back in.
[58:22.000 --> 58:25.000]  Some come in in weeks, some come in in like three months.
[58:25.000 --> 58:27.000]  Stuff's coming back in next week.
[58:27.000 --> 58:30.000]  So I've just decided because of the inventory issues and all the rest of it.
[58:30.000 --> 58:34.000]  And because some of these were selling it, losses are making people buy a lot of other stuff.
[58:34.000 --> 58:37.000]  And we are making a profit. So I'm going to just keep the sale going.
[58:37.000 --> 58:39.000]  But only for 48 hours maximum.
[58:39.000 --> 58:40.000]  And then we've got to stop it.
[58:40.000 --> 58:42.000]  Infowarstore.com.
[58:42.000 --> 58:45.000]  Year-end, now 2020 mega blowout sale.
[58:45.000 --> 58:48.000]  Infowarstore.com. Biggest sales we're ever going to have.
[58:48.000 --> 58:50.000]  Infowarstore.com.
[58:50.000 --> 58:52.000]  We have a new product.
[58:52.000 --> 58:56.000]  And we got several thousand of these in and they're going to sell out in a few days.
[58:56.000 --> 58:57.000]  The rate we're selling them.
[58:57.000 --> 58:59.000]  I want to thank the listeners for getting it.
[58:59.000 --> 59:02.000]  But this really is a game-changing toothpaste.
[59:02.000 --> 59:05.000]  And it doesn't compete with super blue.
[59:05.000 --> 59:08.000]  That's four to five of colloidal silver and iodine and fluoride free.
[59:08.000 --> 59:10.000]  The adult or the children's.
[59:10.000 --> 59:12.000]  These are both excellent toothpaste.
[59:12.000 --> 59:14.000]  Concentrates that don't have fillers.
[59:14.000 --> 59:15.000]  People love it.
[59:15.000 --> 59:21.000]  This is a whitening toothpaste that also has the above sea coral calcium that also cleans
[59:21.000 --> 59:23.000]  and re-mineralizes the teeth.
[59:23.000 --> 59:26.000]  Then it has the patented silver salt.
[59:26.000 --> 59:29.000]  Silver in it to knock out the bacteria that cause ginsivitis.
[59:29.000 --> 59:30.000]  This is all proven.
[59:30.000 --> 59:31.000]  You can make claims with this.
[59:31.000 --> 59:37.000]  But I have to tell you, no one has a toothpaste this good for knocking out the bacteria, the viruses,
[59:37.000 --> 59:42.000]  and cleaning the teeth in a healthy way that doesn't strip away the enamel.
[59:42.000 --> 59:44.000]  So we're really proud of it.
[59:44.000 --> 59:45.000]  It funds the operation.
[59:45.000 --> 59:46.000]  Infowarstore.com.
[59:46.000 --> 59:48.000]  And that's why we're still on air.
[59:48.000 --> 59:52.000]  It's up to you.
[59:52.000 --> 1:00:16.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:16.000 --> 1:00:18.000]  All right, we are back.
[1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:20.000]  I'm going to be going to your phone calls for the next two hours.
[1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:26.000]  Gavin McGinnis is going to be popping in with a lot of breaking news and analysis as well later in the next hour.
[1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:29.000]  But I'm going to your phone calls at the start of the next segment.
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  But I was doing a little plug at the end of the last hour.
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:38.000]  And I was sitting back thinking about game-changing things that we've developed that are really amazing,
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:44.000]  that I haven't talked about, that I haven't really given the credit that's due to them.
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  So right now, I'm so busy, I'm going to cut an ad that you'll see airing in the next week live here on air.
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  So let's do it right now.
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  Listeners and viewers love Brainforce Plus.
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  It's got a whole list of known, clean compounds in nature that give you clean, focused, what I call mental stamina.
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  And it's easy if you've got to work at night, you've been up 16 hours to drink a bunch of coffee,
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:17.000]  but it stops working after a while.
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:20.000]  In fact, at night, coffee makes me sleepy.
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:27.000]  Brainforce Plus does not make me sleepy, regardless of when I take it, and it doesn't have a crash.
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  That's why people take it, and they can't believe how amazing it is now.
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  That said, it's our number one bestseller.
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:36.000]  We sell the most of it.
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  But when we came out with this like five years ago, I looked at some of the leading brands and looked at their markup five to seven times.
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  So they were selling for 80 bucks retail, what they were probably putting, you know, five, six dollars a product in.
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  And I said, we're not going to do that.
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:58.000]  We're going to put even more product in it, retail it at $29.95, and then have it even less.
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  And that's what we've done.
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  So we don't make a lot of money on it, but we sell a ton of it, and people love it.
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  Now, I was talking to the developers, and we were looking at a lot of the other big top sellers out there.
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:13.000]  And, you know, obviously, that's turmeric.
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  So we went and said, well, what's the best turmeric?
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  Well, it's this turmeric extract.
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  It's got the highest ratings.
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  Nobody ever goes above 80 percent.
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  The average turmeric is 5 percent being sold out there.
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:24.000]  This curcumin is 95 percent.
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:30.000]  And there's major studies that turmeric works better, quote, than, you know, prozac type drugs for depression.
[1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  And I'm not billing it as that. I'm just saying that's the power of other nature.
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:37.000]  Well, let's talk about shill force, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  This came out six months ago.
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  It's got 97, 98 percent reviews, but it's not a big seller.
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:52.000]  And I was going to call it Zen Force because this isn't a depressant.
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:59.000]  This is the very best known from science, known from other nature, known from the ancients, fused with modern science and information.
[1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:06.000]  A system that gives you clean, focused, calm clarity.
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:10.000]  And so you can sleep on this, but it's not something that makes you sleepy.
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:18.000]  So it's not like knockout that's got eight known natural compounds that make you really sleepy and work great altogether synergistically.
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:20.000]  My idea, checked with scientists, is totally safe.
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:24.000]  People love it and say it's the best sleep they've ever tried.
[1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  Good, clean sleep as well.
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:30.000]  So you need to go read about shill force, need to see what's in it.
[1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  Stress levels have surpassed all time highs.
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  Anxiety rates are off the charts no matter what side of the political spectrum you're on.
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  You can feel it and the effects are real over time.
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  Chronic stress and contribute to heart disease, high blood pressure, insomnia, sexual dysfunction, and so much more.
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  I take shill force every morning.
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  I really need to because I'm already so hyped up.
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  And I went in just last week and had a yearly checkup and they said, you've got the blood pressure of a marathon runner.
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  Last time you came in, I guess it was two years ago, it was a little high.
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:14.000]  So I mean, I'm telling you, folks, it's what I'm doing is working and it can work for you as well and support the Info War.
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  Oshwagandarute extract, an ancient medicinal herb used for over 3,000 years to treat stress and relax the patient.
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:24.000]  L-theanine, a special amino acid naturally found in tea leaves.
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:27.000]  The compound has been called the stress killer because it's a powerful relaxation benefits.
[1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  GABA, the important neurotransmitter that controls functions of the body and mind, including nervous system.
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:38.000]  Relaxation GABA is a choice to help many get support in natural systems in reaching a state of tranquility.
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  We should call it almost called a tranquility base too.
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:48.000]  Roedolia, rosarute extract, it goes into the super adaption, what it does for stress, and I'm going to just for you.
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  And it does so much more. You got to go read the reviews about it.
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:56.000]  You got to find out how great chill force is or you're really missing out chill force.
[1:04:56.000 --> 1:05:02.000]  Info War's life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[1:05:02.000 --> 1:05:08.000]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including
[1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:14.000]  promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[1:05:14.000 --> 1:05:19.000]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:23.000]  experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:29.000]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research,
[1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:34.000]  a fast acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[1:05:34.000 --> 1:05:38.000]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine.
[1:05:38.000 --> 1:05:44.000]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase,
[1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:48.000]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:51.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[1:05:51.000 --> 1:06:09.000]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[1:06:09.000 --> 1:06:16.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[1:06:16.000 --> 1:06:24.000]  Well, Senator Graham may have been the toadie of John McCain and had some serious problems in my view
[1:06:24.000 --> 1:06:31.000]  of being a military industrial complex minion that Eisenhower warned us about,
[1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:35.000]  but he's been real accurate the last few years on telling us what's coming up in the Senate.
[1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:38.000]  He predicts Senate will take up impeachment trial next week.
[1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:46.000]  That's in the Hill newspaper, also Top of DrugsReport.com. Pretty big deal.
[1:06:46.000 --> 1:06:53.000]  Coming up in the last segment of this hour, I'm going to play a archive clip from Congress
[1:06:53.000 --> 1:07:07.000]  more than a decade ago, breaking down Dinecore and admitted sex trafficking of kidnapped women and children.
[1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:11.000]  And Donald Rumsfeld admitting that they've removed this off YouTube everywhere else.
[1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:16.000]  It's a very low quality clip somewhere. We've got a really good clip of it, but I can't find it.
[1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:25.000]  But we're going to play this and get into the new Epstein information that's all over the news of him with sex slaves.
[1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:27.000]  That's being published in major newspapers.
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:37.000]  Clinton aboard Epstein pedoplane emerge after they all, of course, denied it, and that ties into New York Times reporter claims
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:40.000]  IP address hacked to download child porn Paul Krugman.
[1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:46.000]  And look, just because Paul Krugman looks like what I would think a pedophile would look like, that does not mean he's a pedophile.
[1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:51.000]  That's because he works and serves for the New York Times that tries to cover up stories about pedophilia.
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:53.000]  Does it mean he's a pedophile?
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:57.000]  Just because I wouldn't let my kids get near him does not mean he's guilty.
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:08:06.000]  Because they're constantly trying to plant child porn on people to blackmail them and control them.
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:13.000]  But at a gut level, I don't trust Paul Krugman as far as I can throw him.
[1:08:13.000 --> 1:08:15.000]  That ties into this.
[1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:20.000]  Twitter gives platform to pedophiles to discuss the finer points of raping children.
[1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:24.000]  It's not joking to mainstream out in the open.
[1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:32.000]  So that's why people like Ricky Reves and Dave Chapelle are exposing it because it's now mainstream to expose these monsters.
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:35.000]  That is all coming up at the end of this hour.
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:40.000]  But I want to go to your phone calls also.
[1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:50.000]  The view yesterday praised arguably the most popular, most well-known and doesn't mean he's very popular reality.
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:54.000]  Probably a globalist false flagger in my view.
[1:08:54.000 --> 1:08:58.000]  But that, of course, is Richard Spencer.
[1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:01.000]  You know, it's okay to punch a Nazi guy that they always say.
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:05.000]  By the way, I don't agree with this. Okay, to punch anybody for their speech.
[1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:10.000]  He has come out against Trump in the view has praised him for that.
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:12.000]  Talk about being tone deaf and stupid.
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:15.000]  Very bizarre. That's coming up as well.
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:20.000]  Also, man who impersonated missing boy after watching 2020.
[1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  It's two years in prison.
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:24.000]  Well, you can't ever question a victim.
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:26.000]  Nobody's ever in a conspiracy of a false flag.
[1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:28.000]  Nobody ever claims they're a victim when they're not.
[1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:31.000]  Of course, most of the time they are.
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  So without further ado, Southern stranger Matt Cole.
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  Jasmine.
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  Jasmine.
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:46.000]  And Bob and Josh and Jessica were going to your calls.
[1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  Let's go to that caller in Germany.
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:50.000]  Am I pronouncing it right?
[1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  Jasmine.
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:52.000]  Yes, sorry.
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  Can you hear me?
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:54.000]  That's a very pretty name.
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  Yes, Jasmine.
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:56.000]  Welcome.
[1:09:56.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  It's almost like Charlemagne or go ahead.
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:01.000]  No, it's not like that.
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  It means similar flowers, I think.
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:08.000]  Well, it's good to have you here.
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:12.000]  What's your take on the spread of pedophilia in Germany?
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:14.000]  I see that's what you wanted to raise.
[1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:15.000]  Yes, right.
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:21.000]  Because of course I've been following your news and the media about all this
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:31.000]  pedophilia stuff and today I entered a message board called Yodel in Germany.
[1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  And yeah, I was shocked because there was an idiot who said and I quote,
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  it's really frightening how media treats pedophilia.
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  All the time sexual predators are called pedophiles just because they raped a child.
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  And I thought, boy, boy, oh boy, what the fuck is going on in this freaking country?
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  And yeah, I've been trying to discuss and trying to find out what the hell is wrong
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:02.000]  with these people.
[1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:07.000]  Well, Nambla and the UN and Hollywood are coming out like gay people would come out
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:08.000]  of the closet.
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:12.000]  And so that's why you've seen also allies to it.
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:16.000]  We're not saying they're pedophiles, but the lawyer for Sarah Mala, the whistleblower,
[1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  the fake blower, the hoax blower, goes to theme parks.
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:24.000]  He goes, I like to go to theme parks by myself and he takes photos like a trophy hunter
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:27.000]  would with an elephant behind him of little kids.
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  And then he brags that he gets pedophiles, national security clearances.
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:33.000]  That's his specialty.
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:35.000]  And so you go, why do they do that?
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:38.000]  Well, I mean, it's just rubbing our noses in it.
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:40.000]  And they want you to know.
[1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:46.000]  And they use the national security apparatus to maintain control of civilization and society,
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  a very, very nasty group of folks that are into that and those that are in fields that
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:54.000]  cater to it.
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  The most frightening thing about this discussion and then this message board was that about
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  20 or 30 persons came on different persons and yeah, started discussing and majority
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:14.000]  of those people were on the side of the pedophiles.
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:16.000]  And I was like, boy, you cannot do this.
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:21.000]  You cannot rape a child and then say you cannot call this person not a pedophile.
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  Well, ma'am, let me guess.
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:24.000]  Were you on Twitter or were you on Facebook?
[1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  No, no, no.
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:26.000]  I was.
[1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  No, I hate Twitter and Facebook.
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:30.000]  I'm not on these platforms and I'm trying to get my family off.
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  But it's different.
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:34.000]  Well, let me just tell you, a lot of those have bots.
[1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:36.000]  In fact, most of the people on Facebook have bots.
[1:12:36.000 --> 1:12:39.000]  No, I don't.
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  They'll come in at peer pressure and actually, there's a big article from NationalFile.com.
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:43.000]  Also, Big League Politics has one similar.
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  Twitter allows pedophiles to discuss child sex on their site and recruit children.
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:56.000]  And they've got all these terms that they have for wanting to have sex with children.
[1:12:56.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  And they have little strip teases with toddlers dancing around.
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:06.000]  It's not pedophilia if you have sex with an underage child.
[1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  If this child is older than 14, I mean, come on.
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:11.000]  It's still a child.
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  Well, that's another way to normalize it.
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:16.000]  They'll take some 16-year-old who has a 14-year-old girlfriend.
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:19.000]  I don't think that should be illegal because, you know, they're teenagers.
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:24.000]  And they get that statutory rape that's contributing to the links with C of a minor.
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  That's not pedophilia.
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  But then they try to normalize, oh, let's have sex with 16-year-olds, which is normal in some cultures.
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:34.000]  And then some 16-year-olds who look like they're 25.
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  But then they then nambla wants it down to three-year-olds.
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:42.000]  You see, just like they want to be able to euthanize babies up to age three, they're saying you're not a person till three.
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:46.000]  But at three, you can make your own decisions to have sex, whatever.
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:47.000]  Well, that's asinine.
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  We know that's true.
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:49.000]  Not true.
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  So what they're doing is they're killing the age of consent.
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  They're saying that, oh, California passed a law where they can inoculate 10-year-olds if they decide above their parents.
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  Or 10-year-olds can have abortions.
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  And so that's what this is about, is the state coming in.
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  What you see in Germany with the public schools teaching that grandparents are evil swine because they're not paying their carbon taxes.
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:15.000]  My grandmother is an evil swine.
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:17.000]  I love you, get a thumbbag.
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:18.000]  I mean, I'm sure.
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:20.000]  Have you seen that latest video?
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:21.000]  Yes, sir.
[1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  I mean, my sister, I showed it to her.
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  She worked at the kindergarten.
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  And I told her, please, please don't let these children sing the song.
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  I will come there and I will tell them how disrespectful it is to call your mother.
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:42.000]  Um, that's all how you say it here.
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  Because it's fine.
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:46.000]  Yeah, so swine.
[1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  It's fine and hard.
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  No, but I actually then in this chat room today, I had this discussion with another kindergartner.
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:13.000]  And she basically told me that she was on with those pedophiles and that they are also just victims and that they don't want to do this and that they can be helped.
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:28.000]  But we had a great storytime paid for by the German, Swiss, Dutch, Swedish, not Swiss, Swedish, Canadian, US, Australian government, big fat men dressed like clowns, bringing crying kids in and making them sit on their filthy labs.
[1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  Jasmine, you should do screenshots of that forum.
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  You should start your own blog.
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:32.000]  You should expose it.
[1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  But they're talking about arresting people that criticize the preference to have sex with children.
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:44.000]  We'll be exposing it coming up.
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  More calls straight ahead.
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:56.000]  Please remember, the only way these feeds get out to warn the world is by sharing the links at band.video because big tech is there protecting pedophilia because it's their religion.
[1:15:56.000 --> 1:15:59.000]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[1:15:59.000 --> 1:16:02.000]  So do you know who's on your wireless network?
[1:16:02.000 --> 1:16:09.000]  Whether it's a big company selling your data or a foreign hacker, if you're not protected, everybody sees your information.

[1:16:55.000 --> 1:16:59.000]  I'm here with Scott Yousiam, founder of OMG Tax.
[1:16:59.000 --> 1:17:04.000]  Tell us how your company helps our listeners out there who have a problem with the IRS.
[1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:10.000]  My team of lawyers, enrolled agents, and licensed tax experts remove wage garnishments sometimes in the same day.
[1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:16.000]  We even have reduced the total debt some of our clients were required to pay through what is known as an offer in compromise.
[1:17:16.000 --> 1:17:18.000]  Can you give us an example of somebody you help?
[1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:25.000]  Oh, can I ever? We have taken a $500,000 liability with the IRS. Guess what?
[1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:30.000]  The client didn't pay a dime through the representation known as non-collectible status with the government.
[1:17:30.000 --> 1:17:41.000]  If you owe the IRS more than $10,000 and you want to see if it's possible to pay a lot less, call OMG Tax right now for a free tax-saving consultation.
[1:17:41.000 --> 1:17:48.000]  Call 800-486-8112-800-486-8112.
[1:17:48.000 --> 1:17:57.000]  800-486-8112, that's 800-486-8112.
[1:17:57.000 --> 1:18:08.000]  If you understand why the globalist, why the servants of Satan hate infowars, it's because we're awake, we're alive, we're passionate, and we're not giving up.
[1:18:08.000 --> 1:18:18.000]  That's why it's critical for those of us that are aware of the New World Order's plans to not get down when they attack us and they persecute us and they lie about us.
[1:18:18.000 --> 1:18:22.000]  That's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags.
[1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:28.000]  The globalists have literally sold their souls to the dark side and they do what they do because they're slaves.
[1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:34.000]  Because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent.
[1:18:34.000 --> 1:18:44.000]  It is up to us who are awake, not the sheep and not the wolves, but the sheepdogs to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants.
[1:18:44.000 --> 1:18:49.000]  They fear the fact that we are awake. They fear the fact that we are alive.
[1:18:49.000 --> 1:18:56.000]  They fear the fact that we love God and that's all we ever have to know is that God is in charge.
[1:18:56.000 --> 1:19:04.000]  The globalists know that I will never willingly give up. I've said it many times, I will never give in.
[1:19:04.000 --> 1:19:07.000]  I will never give up, but I could give out.
[1:19:07.000 --> 1:19:13.000]  And it's very, very frustrating to see them committing all their crimes against humanity.
[1:19:13.000 --> 1:19:21.000]  To see evil running rampant like this and to know that most Americans have already been silenced in cyberspace.
[1:19:21.000 --> 1:19:26.000]  That most Americans have already been shadow banned by big tech.
[1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:38.000]  And to know that most Americans feel powerless and don't realize how much power they have by spreading the word about newswars.com, infowars.com and banned.video.
[1:19:38.000 --> 1:19:41.000]  And that people are hungry for the truth now more than ever.
[1:19:41.000 --> 1:19:49.000]  And that if you tell people, hey, the banned truth they don't want you to have is at infowars.com.com.slashow and banned.video.
[1:19:49.000 --> 1:19:56.000]  So take heart, folks. They've had to censor everybody and shut everybody down because the truth is powerful and they can't beat us fair and square.
[1:20:19.000 --> 1:20:39.000]  You heard the last caller from Deutschland talking about being on a mainline forum and there's a defensive pedophilia going on.
[1:20:39.000 --> 1:20:43.000]  That's because the religion of this dark force is destroying innocence.
[1:20:43.000 --> 1:20:49.000]  We're getting to the bottom of the rat hole right now. They're being exposed.
[1:20:49.000 --> 1:20:56.000]  And so they're in a race as it comes out, what they've been doing to children to normalize it, but it's not just about sex with children.
[1:20:56.000 --> 1:21:00.000]  It's about kidnapping them, hurting them, putting them in bondage, selling them.
[1:21:00.000 --> 1:21:08.000]  So we all know it's wrong with sex traffickers that oppress women, right? Pimps.
[1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:10.000]  The left would never defend that.
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:23.000]  Oh, no. But children, oh, now it's a good thing. These are evil, evil things that get a thrill out of promoting destruction.
[1:21:23.000 --> 1:21:33.000]  All right, Matt, Cole, Bob, Josh, Jessica, Mark, Michael, let's go to Jessica in Idaho. Jessica, thanks for holding.
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:39.000]  Hi, Alex. Thank you for taking my call. I just wanted to say thank God for you and info wars.
[1:21:39.000 --> 1:21:44.000]  My husband and I found the David night show actually while we were living in Portland, Oregon.
[1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:51.000]  The more we listened to it, the more and more everything just made sense. We actually started taking your supplements every day.
[1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:57.000]  The DNA force, brain force, turbo force every day. We love them all.
[1:21:57.000 --> 1:21:59.000]  What are they done for you?
[1:21:59.000 --> 1:22:15.000]  A lot of my brain fog has gone away. I kind of have a just, I don't know, like, not clear thought track of mind going on leaves my memory a lot when I'm in the middle of just conversations and stuff like that.
[1:22:15.000 --> 1:22:17.000]  So that's actually gotten a lot better.
[1:22:17.000 --> 1:22:29.000]  I'm so focused now that I actually annoy people around me because I'm popping krill oil and, you know, taking brain force plus. But and I really appreciate your support. We probably shouldn't spend too much time on that.
[1:22:29.000 --> 1:22:36.000]  You were calling in about their coming for the guns. Isn't it amazing? They're now out in the open admitting it.
[1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:40.000]  Yeah, we have a lot of family actually that are really liberal and democratic.
[1:22:40.000 --> 1:22:49.000]  My husband and I both and they always ask us why we don't support any democratic candidate. How can we support Trump? How do we not support any other candidate?
[1:22:49.000 --> 1:22:55.000]  We always say, how are we ever going to vote for a candidate? That's openly saying they're going to take our guns.
[1:22:55.000 --> 1:23:06.000]  One example I love that you guys use on the show a lot is that what slave is or was able to own a gun and they're not. We refuse to be slaves to evil globalists. We're not going to let that happen.
[1:23:06.000 --> 1:23:16.000]  You're not a bad person, so you can have a car. You never run over somebody. There are people run over folks with cars. There are people that stab people with knives, kill them with baseball bats. You can still have a baseball bat.
[1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:21.000]  So exactly why are you bad because somebody else did something bad?
[1:23:21.000 --> 1:23:33.000]  Yeah, yep, exactly. And what right do they have to tell us after so many years and years of able owning a gun and able to own guns? Are we now going to be stripped from them? There's some agenda. There's something going on.
[1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:48.000]  Oh, the Democrats run the local drug gangs. Pelosi is heavily involved with MS-13. She said that. They tell ICE when they tell MS-13 when ICE is coming to bust them. The Democrats are running these criminal operations.
[1:23:48.000 --> 1:24:00.000]  Yeah. And we're not going to vote for it. We are highly against it. We try to tell everybody around the town just as much facts as we can without sounding too preachy or anything like that.
[1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:09.000]  But we do get across to people. We are trying all around the town here to give out supplements to a family that can't have kids. I gave them iodine and female force. I bought it for them for Christmas.
[1:24:09.000 --> 1:24:10.000]  Wonderful.
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:15.000]  Yeah. So we're just hoping that we get a call eventually saying they're going to have a kid. And yeah, we're just trying to get the word out.
[1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:30.000]  Well, that's the number one cause of infertility is fluoride, the bad halogen, blocking the good halogen. That's just a fact. But getting back to David Knight, isn't he a national treasure? I mean, he really does his research. In fact, he really busts his butt to do it.
[1:24:30.000 --> 1:24:38.000]  I told him, David, you don't need to get here at 3 a.m. to get ready for five hours. I said, why don't you get ready for three hours? I mean, that's how hard the guy works.
[1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:49.000]  And you can tell he's really factual. He's really spot on every time we agree with everything he says. He's just a really wholesome guy. And yeah, we support all you guys. And my husband loves David Knight.
[1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:56.000]  Well, when you think that's the treasure you think you think day to night, Jessica, God bless you. Thanks for the call. Yeah.
[1:24:56.000 --> 1:25:05.000]  If I was going to get the platform for the things they made up about me or the stuff they took out of context, I've done some pretty flamboyant wild stuff. Okay.
[1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:14.000]  If I'm thinking it, I'm just going to say it. That's how truthful I am. It's it's to a neurotic level. Okay. People are like, please stop because sometimes things just shouldn't be said.
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:24.000]  David got the platform everywhere just because he has a show here. Classy, smart, gentlemanly, family man, engineer that we recruited.
[1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:32.000]  And he's just he got the platform all over and he doesn't deserve that. But see, that's how evil these people are. Thank you so much for the call.
[1:25:32.000 --> 1:25:46.000]  Let's go now to the gun grabbing that's going on the red flag laws going on all over the country and massive examples of gun confiscation that we'll get to a little bit with Gavin McGinnis next hour.
[1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:51.000]  Josh in Colorado, you're right at the epicenter of it, aren't you?
[1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:59.000]  Yes, Alex. God bless you. Thank you for what you do. I know you hate that, but you know, we're all here inspired because of you.
[1:25:59.000 --> 1:26:05.000]  No, no, no, it's not that I hate it. It's just that I want to hear what you have to say. I love you too. You're awesome.
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:18.000]  Colorado is essentially where people from Illinois and California are collapsing into. I was born and raised here and the entire state is being taken over by Democrats.
[1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:34.000]  Essentially, they're out in the woods. They pollute. It's awful. They're essentially destroying the original Coloradans out here, the miners, the hard work and the lumbers, you know, and now they're coming for our guns.
[1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:50.000]  So essentially people, we need to wake up to what is happening in the belly of our country where the fresh water comes from. You know, it's the only state in union that has the Illuminati eye on its state seal.
[1:26:50.000 --> 1:27:01.000]  Telluride, Boulder, Denver, Fort Collins, Aspen, they have completely taken over the rest of the red of Colorado.
[1:27:01.000 --> 1:27:17.000]  We are we're collapsing, essentially. And I'll tell you what's amazing is that Texas is going the same way as Colorado. And it's in statistics liberals leftist are way higher statistics to steal to not give a charity.
[1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:27.000]  But to tell you they give the charity way higher statistics to pollute to leave garbage to be lazy and to lie about you to bear false witness.
[1:27:27.000 --> 1:27:38.000]  And when they flee California, another state they wrecked, then they come to Colorado, they come to Texas, and they don't even change their mindset.
[1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:46.000]  And they immediately start telling you how to live and what to do. It's just we need to start standing up to the locusts who are not Californians.
[1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:52.000]  They are the children of locusts from all over the world who went there wanting to be movie stars.
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:28:03.000]  If you go somewhere wanting to be a movie star and you're that empty, they're just chumps. And so once they figured out they chewed that state to the bone, now they're coming like locusts that land on us.
[1:28:03.000 --> 1:28:09.000]  And we really need to organize against them politically and let them know what trash they are.
[1:28:09.000 --> 1:28:18.000]  The most frustrating thing, Alex, is that they're trying to shut down mining out here. Miners take care of the land. They reclemate the land.
[1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:27.000]  Sir, they always come in and listen to their poop and pee everywhere. They trash. It's terrible what they're doing to the land.
[1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:35.000]  Listen, let me tell you, Josh, they always come in, they work for the chai comms, they shut down any American industry for a while, then they open it back up later.
[1:28:35.000 --> 1:28:39.000]  They know what they're doing. They are a criminal group of maximum evil.
[1:28:39.000 --> 1:28:44.000]  I've got the article here listing what they're doing in Colorado. It's incredible. The gun confiscation has begun.
[1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:51.000]  President Trump must act now. There it is. It's official Colorado's red flag gun confiscation of the gun. It chronicles a bunch of sickening examples.
[1:28:51.000 --> 1:29:15.000]  Please get the article out infowars.com.
[1:29:21.000 --> 1:29:25.000]  That's danpilla.com danpilla.com.
[1:29:51.000 --> 1:29:57.000]  Trust your family's survival to survivalistcamps.com.
[1:29:57.000 --> 1:30:06.000]  Sunday was supposed to be the last day that we could offer a store-wide free shipping double-patriot points. It was 75% off with our big year in sale.
[1:30:06.000 --> 1:30:10.000]  Because a lot of the products have already sold out. Most of the others are about to sell out.
[1:30:10.000 --> 1:30:17.000]  But quite frankly, I've been working on so many big stories that are breaking right now that I have not come up with new specials.
[1:30:17.000 --> 1:30:24.000]  And we're already so close to selling out all these products that I'm just going to go ahead and keep the sale going for two more days.
[1:30:24.000 --> 1:30:31.000]  And we're going to basically sell out of all of our major product lines. It'll take weeks, months for them all to come back in.
[1:30:31.000 --> 1:30:35.000]  Some come in in weeks, some come in in like three months. A lot of stuff's coming back in next week.
[1:30:35.000 --> 1:30:39.000]  So I've just decided because of the inventory issues, all the rest of it.
[1:30:39.000 --> 1:30:44.000]  And because some of these were selling, losses are making people buy a lot of other stuff and we are making a profit.
[1:30:44.000 --> 1:30:48.000]  So I'm going to just keep the sale going, but only for 48 hours maximum.
[1:30:48.000 --> 1:30:50.000]  And then we've got to stop it.
[1:30:50.000 --> 1:30:54.000]  Infowarstore.com, year-end, now 2020 mega blowout sale.
[1:30:54.000 --> 1:30:57.000]  Infowarstore.com, biggest sales we're ever going to have.
[1:30:57.000 --> 1:31:05.000]  I keep my eye on the news all the time, but I miss the fact that in late 2019, just about two weeks ago,
[1:31:05.000 --> 1:31:15.000]  the CDC and the FDA approved live Ebola vaccine to be given inside the United States.
[1:31:15.000 --> 1:31:19.000]  And it is an experimental vaccine. It is live.
[1:31:19.000 --> 1:31:23.000]  It's not even attenuated. They've just genetically modified it.
[1:31:23.000 --> 1:31:25.000]  So it's supposedly not lethal.
[1:31:25.000 --> 1:31:31.000]  Same stuff they did with the Gardasil vaccine that's admittedly killed and made so many.
[1:31:31.000 --> 1:31:40.000]  This is just crazy. And the Congos had the biggest outbreaks of Ebola ever since they started giving the vaccine there in the last few years.
[1:31:40.000 --> 1:31:47.000]  Oh, and of course, open the borders up here and letting people in unfettered the Democrats distribute across the country.
[1:31:47.000 --> 1:31:50.000]  You cannot make up the magnitude of this insanity.
[1:31:50.000 --> 1:31:56.000]  And it is an attempted Ebola assault on America. This is the new world order.
[1:31:56.000 --> 1:32:00.000]  I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers from InfoWars.
[1:32:00.000 --> 1:32:07.000]  Your support and your help in rebooting Americana is a challenge to the globalist system of corporate tyranny.
[1:32:07.000 --> 1:32:11.000]  It has really caught hold, not just here in the U.S. but worldwide.
[1:32:11.000 --> 1:32:18.000]  And President Trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty is amazing as well.
[1:32:18.000 --> 1:32:23.000]  He's still lacking on the big tech censorship, taking action against that in some other areas.
[1:32:23.000 --> 1:32:29.000]  But trying to end the wars, boosting our economy, speaking out against communist China, Trump's been doing an amazing job.
[1:32:29.000 --> 1:32:36.000]  But now more than ever, we really have to realize that we're being targeted because we are effective.
[1:32:36.000 --> 1:32:41.000]  And the globalists are beginning to lose their war against humanity in a big way.
[1:32:41.000 --> 1:32:44.000]  And so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them.
[1:32:44.000 --> 1:32:49.000]  But it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us.
[1:32:49.000 --> 1:32:59.000]  That's an attempt to moralize us. We've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy.
[1:33:19.000 --> 1:33:25.000]  And I began to pray. Turn this off for a second.
[1:33:41.000 --> 1:33:44.000]  We need to have the humility that Christ gives us.
[1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:49.000]  And I know I need to pray for that because I get so angry that I don't have the strength to overturn these globalists
[1:33:49.000 --> 1:33:53.000]  and they just make me sick. Their spirit won't even dominate us.
[1:33:53.000 --> 1:34:00.000]  My human flesh wants to overthrow them and crush them.
[1:34:00.000 --> 1:34:03.000]  The vengeance, mine, say of the Lord.
[1:34:03.000 --> 1:34:12.000]  We have to focus with strength and courage, stand up for the evil, but not overheat.
[1:34:12.000 --> 1:34:19.000]  And become what we're fighting. And I'm talking to myself.
[1:34:19.000 --> 1:34:26.000]  The way Owen Schreuer, now three weeks ago, stood up during the fake impeachment hearings that resonated worldwide
[1:34:26.000 --> 1:34:29.000]  because it was the Emperor's new clothes.
[1:34:29.000 --> 1:34:32.000]  And the Emperor's new clothes, the three-year-old says the Emperor's wearing no clothes.
[1:34:32.000 --> 1:34:39.000]  No one else would say in a parade that the Emperor's butt naked.
[1:34:39.000 --> 1:34:44.000]  So I'm not likening Owen to a three-year-old, but it is the Emperor's new clothes.
[1:34:44.000 --> 1:34:48.000]  He's saying the obvious. He said it boldly. He said it succinctly.
[1:34:48.000 --> 1:34:54.000]  He said it in a focused way. Strength but not hate.
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:58.000]  It was perfectly done.
[1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:02.000]  And now you see that happening everywhere and now their impeachment has imploded.
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:08.000]  Now they're going to have the trial next week. And what will the deep state do to try to distract from that?
[1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:12.000]  They'll have selective coverage. We'll be here covering it all live if it deep starts next week,
[1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:25.000]  like Lindsey Graham is saying, with only 298 days left until the historic election.
[1:35:25.000 --> 1:35:31.000]  My biggest problem is when I get attacked, when I get lied about, and when I see how effective we've been,
[1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:41.000]  instead of getting afraid, I just get wild and just want to fight so hard that it's like revving a racecar engine too high.
[1:35:41.000 --> 1:35:56.000]  And we have to find a balance between not being in a coma but not being a Tasmanian devil.
[1:35:56.000 --> 1:36:05.000]  But we do have to call these people out and we do have to get in their face and just say, hey, I don't hate you.
[1:36:05.000 --> 1:36:12.000]  You're out of control though. We need to have that authority in the way we do it.
[1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:16.000]  But the most important thing is we have to take action. That means we're going to be perfect.
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:21.000]  We're not going to have holes in one every time like Owen did.
[1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:27.000]  By the way, it turns out there weren't any guests in there. The seats were all empty because Nadler was violating the rules
[1:36:27.000 --> 1:36:33.000]  and not even allowing the public in. But Owen looked so sharp and was so confident, not in a fake confidence,
[1:36:33.000 --> 1:36:39.000]  but a mission-oriented confidence. He walked right in and Drew has a confident bearing as well.
[1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:45.000]  So they just walked in like they own the place. That's why in all the tapes we play, we never really put a clip where they're walking in
[1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:52.000]  like they own the place. And we've always got the footage shot from their cameras, but the footage of them from the front
[1:36:52.000 --> 1:36:57.000]  when they're walking in is really powerful. Maybe someday we'll play that again.
[1:36:57.000 --> 1:37:04.000]  But this is a great time of awakening.
[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:11.000]  And you hear the callers talking about all the pedophilia coming out and the rest of it. They're in a race they can't win.
[1:37:11.000 --> 1:37:17.000]  They're never going to normalize it. It's a bridge too far. And when it comes out all the child trafficking and how it's a huge business
[1:37:17.000 --> 1:37:23.000]  and how Epstein was just a manager, it's going to bring the deep state down. They're not going to survive this.
[1:37:23.000 --> 1:37:29.000]  It's bad enough when you've got an old creepy priest doing this stuff to kids, but when they're putting them on airplanes
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:35.000]  and flying them around and they're dying and stuff, I mean, this is right out of a Satanism Hollywood movie
[1:37:35.000 --> 1:37:42.000]  because Hollywood's telling you what they're really into. All right, we've got a bunch of callers here.
[1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:50.000]  Who's been holding the longest? That would be Matt in Texas, then Francisco in California.
[1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:53.000]  Matt, welcome and thanks for holding.
[1:37:53.000 --> 1:37:56.000]  Alex, it's an honor to speak with you. I appreciate you taking the time.
[1:37:56.000 --> 1:37:58.000]  I appreciate you.
[1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:05.000]  So we're talking about guns. I just wanted to throw out there just a few months ago.
[1:38:05.000 --> 1:38:14.000]  China held a meeting in Beijing with anti-gun activists from the United States.
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:19.000]  They come up with a little gym and say where is it?
[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:26.000]  It is called for anybody to just look it up. The US Human Rights and Democracy Act.
[1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:33.000]  So they brought people from the United States, these anti-guns, these Bloomberg-backed clowns over there.
[1:38:33.000 --> 1:38:38.000]  And you can read the article on AmericanMilitaryNews.com. It's all there. It's just out everywhere.
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:45.000]  But there's no holds about it. They're being very blatant, very brazen right now.
[1:38:45.000 --> 1:38:50.000]  Everything going on in Virginia, everything going on in Colorado happening everywhere.
[1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:55.000]  Indiana, Kentucky, with as close as Texas came to turning blue, you can believe we're watching.
[1:38:55.000 --> 1:38:57.000]  Very closely.
[1:38:57.000 --> 1:39:03.000]  But, you know, another thing to remember, anybody who cares to give an ear for a few seconds,
[1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:13.000]  if it wasn't for American guns in World War II, Alex, you and me would be having this conversation in German right now.
[1:39:13.000 --> 1:39:18.000]  Well, America's been asleep and the globalists think we're weak, but they've bitten off more than they can chew,
[1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:21.000]  and people really are waking up. But now we've got to take it into action.
[1:39:21.000 --> 1:39:26.000]  We've got to start saying no to the system and suing the system and having injunctions and blocking them
[1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:33.000]  and saying no and going into the city councils and going in to the school boards and just saying you're not doing it.
[1:39:33.000 --> 1:39:40.000]  I mean, they're teaching anal sex in Austin to five-year-olds. They make Austinites pay for abortion on demand, taxpayers.
[1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:44.000]  It's sick, it's evil, it's domination, and it's wrong. Thank you, Matt.
[1:39:44.000 --> 1:39:48.000]  Francisco in California, you're on the air, Francisco. Welcome.
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:50.000]  Hi, Alex. How's it going?
[1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:51.000]  Good, brother.
[1:39:51.000 --> 1:40:00.000]  Okay, so what I wanted to bring up was when Trump made his statements and followed the day after the missile strikes from way around,
[1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:08.000]  he brought up the last administration and the pallet of cash. Not too many people seem to be talking about that.
[1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:21.000]  You know, practically pointing the finger at Obama, kind of, you know, giving that, insinuating that trees and practically, you know,
[1:40:21.000 --> 1:40:33.000]  from the last administration. And I don't know, I haven't heard anybody really talk too much about that.
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:39.000]  I'm sorry, my mic's breaking up. I mean, my audio's breaking up. What were you saying there, Francisco, at the end?
[1:40:39.000 --> 1:40:50.000]  Well, it was about just that nobody really talked about that fact that practically calling out the Obama administration for treason with, you know, the missiles that were used in the pallets of cash.
[1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:55.000]  Oh, absolutely, sure. So it was a rhetorical statement, absolutely.
[1:40:55.000 --> 1:41:05.000]  Yeah, just giving out, letting the whole world know practically that Obama's in the crosshairs, probably.
[1:41:05.000 --> 1:41:13.000]  All right, I appreciate your call. Thank you. All right, let's go ahead and take another call. Let's talk to Brie in South Carolina.
[1:41:13.000 --> 1:41:15.000]  You're on the air. Go ahead.
[1:41:15.000 --> 1:41:20.000]  Hey, Alex. First of all, thank you so much for having me on your show.
[1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:21.000]  Thank you for calling.
[1:41:21.000 --> 1:41:41.000]  I just wanted to talk about, like, the medical freedoms and vaccines and how much it makes me so sick, because I have an eight-month-old at home, and, you know, he's my first child, and I can't even imagine, you know, somebody coming into my house and trying to take him to
[1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:51.000]  vaccinate him, and then the fact that they're throwing out homeschooling, they're a band on homeschooling, because that's what I was going to do.
[1:41:51.000 --> 1:41:57.000]  But, I mean, I still plan on doing it, but it just, it makes me so sick.
[1:41:57.000 --> 1:42:04.000]  Well, they're saying they own your children. I mean, that's what, that's what the definition of slavery is, is that they've got big professors out.
[1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:14.000]  They've got big professors saying, get rid of single-family dwellings. Well, that's how they're already zoning in Europe and starting to zone in blue cities here.
[1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:23.000]  This isn't coming. This is here. This isn't coming. This is here. This isn't coming. This is here.
[1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:32.000]  And it's amazing how many, like, I don't know any all, I guess you could say, and it's just amazing how many people my age just totally fall for it.
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:43.000]  And when I try to show them information, factual information, they think it's biased, or they, they just think I'm crazier, you know.
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:51.000]  Hold on, Bree. I'm going to come back to you, but first I want to get into this whole latest Epstein information that goes right to the bottom of the rat hole.
[1:42:51.000 --> 1:43:03.000]  We'll be right back, infowars.com, newswars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[1:43:22.000 --> 1:43:33.000]  The globalists have literally sold their souls to the dark side, and they do what they do because they're slaves, because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent.
[1:43:33.000 --> 1:43:43.000]  It is up to us who are awake, not the sheep and not the wolves, but the sheepdogs, to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants.
[1:43:43.000 --> 1:43:56.000]  They fear the fact that we are awake, they fear the fact that we are alive, they fear the fact that we love God, and that's all we ever have to know is that God is in charge.
[1:43:56.000 --> 1:44:07.000]  I spend a lot of time reminding the infowars, the family of listeners and viewers that without you we won't be on the air, and I spend a lot of time thanking you.
[1:44:07.000 --> 1:44:15.000]  But I really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really changing the world for the better and raising the alarm as modern ball reveres.
[1:44:15.000 --> 1:44:22.000]  But something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are really amazing.
[1:44:22.000 --> 1:44:27.000]  You've got that pledge from me, but you've seen the third-party test out there, the air filtration, the water filtration.
[1:44:27.000 --> 1:44:37.000]  The supplements are all the very best you're going to find out there, and you can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalist this hard.
[1:44:37.000 --> 1:44:51.000]  So it's not a burden to support infowars. It really is something that is good for everybody that stands for justice and freedom and makes your life and your family's life and your children's life so much better.

[1:45:31.000 --> 1:45:35.000]  You see, we have to make the effort. 110% God will finish the move.

[1:47:23.000 --> 1:47:31.000]  Look, talking of all you perverts, it was a big year for paedophile movies.
[1:47:31.000 --> 1:47:37.000]  Surviving R. Kelly, Leaving Neverland, Two Popes.
[1:47:37.000 --> 1:47:39.000]  Shut up, shut up.
[1:47:39.000 --> 1:47:41.000]  I don't care, I don't care.
[1:47:41.000 --> 1:47:45.000]  Many talented people of colour were snubbed in major categories.
[1:47:45.000 --> 1:47:53.000]  Unfortunately, there's nothing we can do about that. The Hollywood foreign press are all very, very racist.
[1:47:53.000 --> 1:48:01.000]  And he went on and on to tell them, you're not interesting, you're not original, you read off scripts,
[1:48:01.000 --> 1:48:07.000]  and you're stalking children's theme parks by yourselves.
[1:48:07.000 --> 1:48:11.000]  And he went on and on from there in just a three minute clip.
[1:48:11.000 --> 1:48:23.000]  Now, that's to their face, a rotting evil edifice with Meryl Streep and people praising
[1:48:23.000 --> 1:48:29.000]  famous directors that have been convicted of raping little girls after they drugged them,
[1:48:29.000 --> 1:48:31.000]  Roman Polanski and others.
[1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:37.000]  But she'll lecture you all day about how masculine men are bad. Now, families are bad.
[1:48:37.000 --> 1:48:41.000]  These are monsters. These are degenerate scum.
[1:48:41.000 --> 1:48:45.000]  And they're a window into the real world.
[1:48:45.000 --> 1:48:57.000]  So I'm going to play a clip here from a hearing more than a decade ago with Cynthia McKinney,
[1:48:57.000 --> 1:48:59.000]  who's a Democrat, who's a liberal, who had a lot of courage.
[1:48:59.000 --> 1:49:01.000]  But that is the issue.
[1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:11.000]  Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and I guess this was how many years ago is that?
[1:49:11.000 --> 1:49:13.000]  It's like 13, 14 years ago now.
[1:49:13.000 --> 1:49:25.000]  Times is flying about Dyncor and children that have been grabbed overseas, put on planes,
[1:49:25.000 --> 1:49:27.000]  and disappeared, some of which end up dead.
[1:49:27.000 --> 1:49:32.000]  So you see, that's what's really at the bottom of the rat hole for these globalists.
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:38.000]  But here's some of the articles out today in FullWars.com.
[1:49:38.000 --> 1:49:41.000]  Picks of Clinton aboard Epstein-Pito plane emerge.
[1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:49.000]  And we'll show you that article, maybe show you some of the really creepy photos of Bill Clinton with sex slaves.
[1:49:49.000 --> 1:49:58.000]  Again, the story is on infowars.com. Look at Bill Clinton looking just like a vampire and one of those sad women,
[1:49:58.000 --> 1:50:03.000]  many of which were grabbed at 12, 13, 14, 15, and then paraded around for photos in front of the Secret Service
[1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:06.000]  by the time they were 18, president and the pimp.
[1:50:06.000 --> 1:50:10.000]  But it's bigger than being a pimp.
[1:50:10.000 --> 1:50:15.000]  It's a lot bigger than being a pimp.
[1:50:15.000 --> 1:50:19.000]  It's about the trafficking of these children.
[1:50:19.000 --> 1:50:23.000]  Now, these videos have been taken off YouTube.
[1:50:23.000 --> 1:50:27.000]  And if you put it up on YouTube, any of these congressional hearings,
[1:50:27.000 --> 1:50:31.000]  where they had whole hearings about Dyncor and the UN and sex trafficking,
[1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:36.000]  and thousands of women and children per country, some of them three-year-olds gang raped,
[1:50:36.000 --> 1:50:42.000]  but their heads blown off, I mean, we've got to dig around somewhere in our archives,
[1:50:42.000 --> 1:50:47.000]  but you aren't archives at all. It might be in a hard drive somewhere to find those whole hearings.
[1:50:47.000 --> 1:50:49.000]  Or we should go into the C-SPAN archives.
[1:50:49.000 --> 1:50:54.000]  C-SPAN's got a good archive now and search these out and get it from C-SPAN itself.
[1:50:54.000 --> 1:51:01.000]  Like, well, maybe we'll order the HD from them. In fact, we will.
[1:51:01.000 --> 1:51:09.000]  And so let's go over some of these articles for you because people ask me, they say,
[1:51:09.000 --> 1:51:12.000]  how did you know about Epstein 13, 14 years ago?
[1:51:12.000 --> 1:51:16.000]  Because he was in news articles.
[1:51:16.000 --> 1:51:23.000]  He was named being involved in this and then involved in all these secret eugenics groups and world government boards.
[1:51:23.000 --> 1:51:27.000]  15, 16 years ago, but they were saying it like it was a good thing.
[1:51:27.000 --> 1:51:28.000]  Here's the New York Times.
[1:51:28.000 --> 1:51:33.000]  U.S.-placed immigrant children with traffickers report says, knowingly,
[1:51:33.000 --> 1:51:38.000]  Hillary Clinton and Dyncor, the untold story of the 15-year-old belly dancer.
[1:51:38.000 --> 1:51:45.000]  Epstein connection to CIA and Dyncor and the airplanes they were running together.
[1:51:45.000 --> 1:51:47.000]  He wasn't just doing this.
[1:51:47.000 --> 1:51:53.000]  I liked it earlier, too, having underage girls on his plane, which is the tip of the iceberg.
[1:51:53.000 --> 1:51:56.000]  And that's like a peanut farmer having peanuts on their plane.
[1:51:56.000 --> 1:52:01.000]  He's farming these girls worldwide. Big articles on that.
[1:52:01.000 --> 1:52:08.000]  Aircraft number shared by Jeffrey Epstein, Dyncor, the State Department and the CIA.
[1:52:08.000 --> 1:52:12.000]  You can read all these articles going back 10, 12, 13, 14 years.
[1:52:12.000 --> 1:52:14.000]  This was all out then.
[1:52:14.000 --> 1:52:17.000]  People say, oh, Alex Jones broke all this. Alex Jones knew all this.
[1:52:17.000 --> 1:52:22.000]  This was all out there then that the currency, these shadow groups that have taken over our government to operate in
[1:52:22.000 --> 1:52:32.000]  is kidnap women and children, stolen art, drugs, snuff films.
[1:52:32.000 --> 1:52:34.000]  Here's one on a DW.
[1:52:34.000 --> 1:52:39.000]  UN tries to cover up peacekeeper sex abuse scandal.
[1:52:39.000 --> 1:52:45.000]  U.S. military contractor Dyncor accused of enslaving American employees in Kuwait.
[1:52:45.000 --> 1:52:54.000]  And it goes on and on. U.S. sex scandal still haunts Dyncor. That's 2002.
[1:52:54.000 --> 1:52:56.000]  That's 18 years ago.
[1:52:56.000 --> 1:52:58.000]  This is all real stuff. This is a speculation.
[1:52:58.000 --> 1:53:03.000]  So that's why the media is covering this up, because Obama and Hillary and all of them are involved
[1:53:03.000 --> 1:53:13.000]  in bringing the kids in from all over the world and just loading them on buses that just disappeared into the hinterland.
[1:53:13.000 --> 1:53:17.000]  They're trying to investigate charges of multiple child rapes by Dyncor employees in Columbia.
[1:53:17.000 --> 1:53:21.000]  And it goes on and on. And used to, you'd have this in Reuters and AP and the London Guardian.
[1:53:21.000 --> 1:53:28.000]  Now they won't even report on it.
[1:53:28.000 --> 1:53:32.000]  Because they're protecting it, and that's all come out thanks to Project Veritas undercover videos.
[1:53:32.000 --> 1:53:38.000]  So that's how sick this whole group is, and that's why Hollywood's trying to normalize pedophilia.
[1:53:38.000 --> 1:53:43.000]  And I guess kidnapping kids out of their backyards, because they know it's all coming out.
[1:53:43.000 --> 1:53:47.000]  And it's all been coming out from Info Wars and President Trump and others.
[1:53:47.000 --> 1:53:50.000]  And that's why they always go, oh, Trump met Epstein a few times at parties.
[1:53:50.000 --> 1:53:53.000]  Oh, it's Trump's the one involved. No, Trump's not involved.
[1:53:53.000 --> 1:53:57.000]  If I found Trump involved in any of this, I would never have supported him.
[1:53:57.000 --> 1:53:59.000]  Trump never came up with any of this.
[1:53:59.000 --> 1:54:02.000]  Are Republicans involved? You bet they are.
[1:54:02.000 --> 1:54:04.000]  And this is evil.
[1:54:04.000 --> 1:54:10.000]  Here are some of the clips from the congressional hearings where Rumsfeld didn't deny that they'd been caught doing this,
[1:54:10.000 --> 1:54:17.000]  that Dincourt had, and had had some of their contracts taken, but had that reinstated. Here it is.
[1:54:17.000 --> 1:54:27.000]  Mr. Secretary, I watched President Bush deliver a moving speech at the United Nations in September 2003,
[1:54:27.000 --> 1:54:31.000]  in which he mentioned the crisis of the sex trade.
[1:54:31.000 --> 1:54:36.000]  The President called for the punishment of those involved in this horrible business.
[1:54:36.000 --> 1:54:45.000]  But at the very moment of that speech, Dincourt was exposed for having been involved in the buying and selling of young women and children.
[1:54:45.000 --> 1:54:53.000]  While all of this was going on, Dincourt kept the Pentagon contract to administer the smallpots, nantrax vaccines,
[1:54:53.000 --> 1:54:59.000]  and is now working on a plague vaccine through the joint vaccine acquisition program.
[1:54:59.000 --> 1:55:06.000]  Mr. Secretary, is it policy of the U.S. government to reward companies that traffic in women and little girls?
[1:55:06.000 --> 1:55:10.000]  Thank you, Representative.
[1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:15.000]  The answer to your first question is no, absolutely not.
[1:55:15.000 --> 1:55:25.000]  The policy of the United States government is clear, unambiguous, and opposed to the activities that you described.
[1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:29.000]  The second question.
[1:55:29.000 --> 1:55:39.000]  Well, how do you explain the fact that Dincourt and its successor companies have received and continue to receive government contracts?
[1:55:39.000 --> 1:55:48.000]  I would have to go and find the facts, but there are laws and rules and regulations with respect to government contracts.
[1:55:48.000 --> 1:55:55.000]  And there are times that corporations do things they should not do, in which case they tend to be suspended for some period.
[1:55:55.000 --> 1:56:03.000]  There are times then that under the laws and the rules and regulations passed by the Congress and implemented by the executive branch,
[1:56:03.000 --> 1:56:13.000]  that corporations can get off out of the penalty box, if you will, and be permitted to engage in contracts with the government.
[1:56:13.000 --> 1:56:17.000]  They're generally not barred in perpetuity.
[1:56:17.000 --> 1:56:21.000]  This contract, this company, was never in the penalty box.
[1:56:21.000 --> 1:56:24.000]  If you could proceed to my second question, please.
[1:56:24.000 --> 1:56:30.000]  So that's a good Democrat. She got really demonized in right wing media and stuff, but boy, isn't she great compared to the squad?
[1:56:30.000 --> 1:56:35.000]  And that was all admitted. They had other hearings all about that.
[1:56:35.000 --> 1:56:39.000]  And who also does a lot of the private CPS work around the country? Dincourt of this day.
[1:56:39.000 --> 1:56:47.000]  So Laura Silsby worked for the Clinton Foundation high level, got caught smuggling kids out of Haiti, got a few years in prison for it.
[1:56:47.000 --> 1:56:51.000]  Now she's secretly under a new name, runs the Amber Alert system.
[1:56:51.000 --> 1:56:54.000]  Look it up. You cannot make this up.

[1:59:44.000 --> 1:59:47.000]  We're fighting to win and we are winning. Thanks to you.
[1:59:49.000 --> 1:59:53.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:59:53.000 --> 2:00:04.000]  We are transferring power from Washington DC and giving it back to you, the people.
[2:00:07.000 --> 2:00:11.000]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.
[2:00:11.000 --> 2:00:14.000]  This is the heart of 1776.
[2:00:14.000 --> 2:00:19.000]  Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[2:00:19.000 --> 2:00:26.000]  Huge nationwide protests erupted once again on President Donald Trump's second weekend in office.
[2:00:31.000 --> 2:00:37.000]  When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.
[2:00:37.000 --> 2:00:43.000]  When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.
[2:00:43.000 --> 2:00:47.000]  Donald J. Trump is now president of the United States.
[2:00:47.000 --> 2:00:52.000]  And most importantly, we will be protected by God.
[2:00:52.000 --> 2:00:55.000]  From the front lines of the info wheel.
[2:00:55.000 --> 2:00:58.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[2:00:58.000 --> 2:01:03.000]  All right, Gavin McGinnis is going to join us for a couple of segments to talk about the bizarre behavior of the squad.
[2:01:03.000 --> 2:01:09.000]  They'll continue on with your calls, but I held Bree in South Carolina over because she got cut short.
[2:01:09.000 --> 2:01:15.000]  It was just about a minute and a half call and she was talking about vaccines and how they're trying to bully everybody.
[2:01:15.000 --> 2:01:17.000]  Now they're pushing them.
[2:01:17.000 --> 2:01:21.000]  And of course the inserts say they can kill you, but on the news they say that's a conspiracy theory.
[2:01:21.000 --> 2:01:24.000]  So why don't you be able to continue your points, Bree?
[2:01:24.000 --> 2:01:25.000]  Thank you.
[2:01:25.000 --> 2:01:34.000]  Yeah, basically, I mean, I just wanted to throw that out there because I was listening to the David Night Show this morning and I don't think he was taking any calls.
[2:01:34.000 --> 2:01:44.000]  But I think it's really important and I feel like they're just sweeping everything under the rug and slowly trying to take it from us.
[2:01:44.000 --> 2:01:53.000]  And it's scary, but at the same time, like I will die before somebody takes my rights and medical freedoms for my child.
[2:01:53.000 --> 2:02:02.000]  Well, especially with the long history of Big Pharma, the US government and others adding things to vaccines in secret experiments in the Tuskegee experiment, all the rest.
[2:02:02.000 --> 2:02:05.000]  And then they have liability protection for these companies.
[2:02:05.000 --> 2:02:06.000]  It's insane.
[2:02:06.000 --> 2:02:14.000]  Bree, thank you so much. Let's now go to Matt in Ohio wants to talk about the Epstein case. Wow.
[2:02:14.000 --> 2:02:19.000]  Bill Clinton with the sex slaves, the photos out. This is really unraveling quickly.
[2:02:19.000 --> 2:02:25.000]  The pedophiles are trying to normalize pedophilia, hoping that just becomes some new, you know, thing like the trans movement.
[2:02:25.000 --> 2:02:30.000]  But it's not going to work because so much of it is kidnapping children and murdering them on top of it.
[2:02:30.000 --> 2:02:32.000]  What do you make of all this, Matt?
[2:02:32.000 --> 2:02:42.000]  Well, I just wanted to say real quick here, and this really ties into some ways to raise funds for the Info War.
[2:02:42.000 --> 2:02:53.000]  If our fellow Info Warriors aren't hip, they need to check out Rob Dews, the false flag, Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself music video.
[2:02:53.000 --> 2:02:54.000]  It is amazing.
[2:02:54.000 --> 2:03:00.000]  And that was just a quick suggestion for you and your crew.
[2:03:00.000 --> 2:03:08.000]  I hope that you guys continue making inroads through the music and you have been over these last few years.
[2:03:08.000 --> 2:03:23.000]  And just one quick suggestion is to consider doing like a seven inch single club or a vinyl version of some of these tunes that you're doing because it really is the new punk rock.
[2:03:23.000 --> 2:03:25.000]  You're absolutely right. People aren't going to buy CDs.
[2:03:25.000 --> 2:03:31.000]  We've tried that with great music we produced, but collector's items vinyl is a form of art.
[2:03:31.000 --> 2:03:37.000]  The sound has been proven to be better because, again, it's not digital peaks and valleys.
[2:03:37.000 --> 2:03:38.000]  It's a rolling.
[2:03:38.000 --> 2:03:40.000]  It's organic.
[2:03:40.000 --> 2:03:43.000]  It's like cellulose versus digital.
[2:03:43.000 --> 2:03:44.000]  And that is a really great idea.
[2:03:44.000 --> 2:03:47.000]  What do you make of all the Epstein stuff coming out?
[2:03:47.000 --> 2:03:48.000]  It just makes me sick.
[2:03:48.000 --> 2:03:57.000]  And I'm just, I really, I'm just really looking forward to, you know, people being held accountable and a couple quick, quick comments real quickly.
[2:03:57.000 --> 2:04:03.000]  You'll be, you'll be thrilled to know I'm driving through a big city, say here in, in Ohio.
[2:04:03.000 --> 2:04:08.000]  And what should I see on an abandoned billboard sign, but somebody had spray painted.
[2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:09.000]  Yes, you got it.
[2:04:09.000 --> 2:04:18.000]  Band video, it rules seeing that over the horizon. Another quick, quick idea is maybe do more music related stuff.
[2:04:18.000 --> 2:04:29.000]  Not only with like the false flags project that Rob do was on, but I love that old school interview that you did with Professor Griff or that interview that was done with you and KRS.
[2:04:29.000 --> 2:04:34.000]  Oh, all those incredible archives, five billion views are raced off of YouTube.
[2:04:34.000 --> 2:04:38.000]  We need, we don't even have the crib, but we're trying to have an archivist go back and post all that to band video.
[2:04:38.000 --> 2:04:40.000]  By the way, folks, you have been doing your job.
[2:04:40.000 --> 2:04:46.000]  Band video, which is free, of course, between the word out is exponentially growing and viewership every month.
[2:04:46.000 --> 2:04:47.000]  It is just exploding.
[2:04:47.000 --> 2:04:52.000]  We routinely get videos with half a million, a million views, 300,000, 200,000.
[2:04:52.000 --> 2:05:09.000]  That's incredible info or store.com. We have a new product and we got several thousand of these in and they're going to sell out in a few days at the rate we're selling them.
[2:05:09.000 --> 2:05:22.000]  You can compete with super blue that's four to five a colloidal silver and iodine and fluoride free, the adult or the children's. These are both excellent toothpaste concentrates that don't have fillers. People love it.
[2:05:22.000 --> 2:05:30.000]  This is a whitening toothpaste that also has the above sea coral calcium that also cleans, but also re mineralizes the teeth.
[2:05:30.000 --> 2:05:48.000]  It's a patented silver salt, silver in it to knock out the bacteria that causes gensivitis. This is all proven. You can make claims with this, but I have to tell you, no one has a toothpaste this good for knocking out the bacteria, the viruses, and cleaning the teeth in a healthy way that doesn't strip away the enamel.
[2:05:48.000 --> 2:06:11.000]  So we're really proud of it. It funds the operation info or store.com. That's why we're still on air. Thanks to you.
[2:06:11.000 --> 2:06:23.000]  From deep in the heart of FEMA region six, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[2:06:23.000 --> 2:06:37.000]  And I'm very glad to say that I was part of 132 and also the vote for Barbara Lee's amendment. But I think that the point of that is that that is the same war that we're dealing with today.
[2:06:37.000 --> 2:06:54.000]  We never solved any problems with AUMF. We left 4,000 plus maybe 4,400 dead and over 60,000 who came back injured in some form and the war never ended.
[2:06:54.000 --> 2:07:08.000]  As I recall the language in AUMF, it deals with hostilities in Iraq. It doesn't deal with an incident or a dislike or someone in a car coming in from the airport.
[2:07:08.000 --> 2:07:20.000]  That is the danger of not acting. And I do think without leadership, meaning the leadership of CPC that will come together around Pacific answers.
[2:07:20.000 --> 2:07:29.000]  I'm incredibly saddened and it's very hard to think about this.
[2:07:29.000 --> 2:07:32.000]  So I mean that is the land of unconfirmed videos.
[2:07:32.000 --> 2:07:40.000]  We came, we saw, he died. Did it have anything to do with your visit? I'm sure it did.
[2:07:40.000 --> 2:07:56.000]  I have two words for you. Predator drones. You will never see it coming. You think I'm joking?
[2:07:56.000 --> 2:08:11.000]  Yeah, McGinnis is our guest. He doesn't really need any introduction.
[2:08:11.000 --> 2:08:17.000]  He has the great folks over at censored.tv or free speech. TV is also known in the colloquial.
[2:08:17.000 --> 2:08:26.000]  And I'm really glad to get him on. I want to get him on for about a week or so. And I said, what do you want to come on about when he finally could come on?
[2:08:26.000 --> 2:08:35.000]  He said, I want to get into what we just played some of Ilhan Omar laughing while they're up there talking about dead troops and just cracking jokes and just the bizarreness of the left across the board,
[2:08:35.000 --> 2:08:48.000]  worshipping this general and just all of this craziness. So Gavin, good to have you on with us. And I got to say that is an awesome looking jacket.
[2:08:48.000 --> 2:08:50.000]  Can you see that it sparkles?
[2:08:50.000 --> 2:08:56.000]  It's definitely slick. I like it.
[2:08:56.000 --> 2:09:03.000]  It's a little bit gay, but sometimes some of the best fashion choices are you just sort of dip your toes in the pool without jumping in.
[2:09:03.000 --> 2:09:07.000]  I don't know. I mean, blue velvet, you pull it off. I don't know.
[2:09:07.000 --> 2:09:09.000]  I'm not gay. It just feels good.
[2:09:09.000 --> 2:09:15.000]  Well, I mean, I think Elvis might wear something like that. I don't think Elvis. I think Elvis was known for locking the ladies.
[2:09:15.000 --> 2:09:20.000]  Yeah, it's called peacocking, my friend.
[2:09:20.000 --> 2:09:24.000]  Liberace went a little too far. He jumped right into the pool.
[2:09:24.000 --> 2:09:27.000]  But of course, Liberace wasn't gay.
[2:09:27.000 --> 2:09:38.000]  I have tacky Theodore Acropolis, the guy who runs tacky mag, the Greek tycoon. He came up to me once at a dinner party and he goes, Gavin, he straps you on the back and he goes, ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
[2:09:38.000 --> 2:09:45.000]  If Liberace is still like pussy, he'd still be with us.
[2:09:45.000 --> 2:09:48.000]  Oh, my goodness. You know, you started Vice Magazine.
[2:09:48.000 --> 2:09:58.000]  You've basically rolled with a lot of the cultural elites. Was pedophilia always like their favorite thing?
[2:09:58.000 --> 2:10:01.000]  Or why are they all over the place promoting pedophilia right now?
[2:10:01.000 --> 2:10:06.000]  I've got articles where Twitter is saying it's OK to talk about wanting to have sex with children and all the rest of it.
[2:10:06.000 --> 2:10:11.000]  Why do you think that's such a big story right now with all this new Epstein stuff coming out?
[2:10:11.000 --> 2:10:25.000]  I remember in the late 80s and early 90s in the punk rock community, there was some very out there esoteric dudes who were trans and they'd have like sneakers on and a slip and some lipstick, but this air.
[2:10:25.000 --> 2:10:33.000]  And they'd have these anarchist workshops and they would talk about sexuality and how, you know, even children have sexuality.
[2:10:33.000 --> 2:10:44.000]  And inevitably, there'd be a slew of single mom punks who were, you know, trailer trash. You had kids when they were 15, 16, and they would just pop a gasket and go ballistic and drag him out of there by his heels.
[2:10:44.000 --> 2:10:53.000]  So I think it's always existed in the weirdo scene, but it's always been esoteric and it's always met with an immediate backlash.
[2:10:53.000 --> 2:11:03.000]  The strange thing about now is we've been giving these nuts so much freedom, so much slack on the rope that they've just gone off the edge of the cliff.
[2:11:03.000 --> 2:11:10.000]  And now pedophilia. Well, I mean, if they don't molest children, then they're not child molesters. They're just pedophiles.
[2:11:10.000 --> 2:11:14.000]  I mean, you got to be more open minded. It's a disease.
[2:11:14.000 --> 2:11:23.000]  And you go, that's a great indication of where we are as a society when pedophiles are, I don't know, kind of possible.
[2:11:23.000 --> 2:11:29.000]  Speaking of the devil, I don't want to bring these subjects up. This was being taught in schools now. This isn't just here or there.
[2:11:29.000 --> 2:11:39.000]  This isn't just at some method art gallery. Like you're saying, this is happening, not in some corner of Amsterdam or the village in New York.
[2:11:39.000 --> 2:11:46.000]  This is in elementary school. Government saying we want to teach children how to masturbate. It's really all about power.
[2:11:46.000 --> 2:11:52.000]  It's about control. It's about saying your children don't belong to you. And that's why they're now pushing forced inoculations.
[2:11:52.000 --> 2:11:54.000]  Where do you stand on that?
[2:11:54.000 --> 2:12:06.000]  Well, before that, we get to the forced inoculations. There was a sometimes there's a sentence in the news that I just want to tattoo on my chest because it just sums up the problem perfectly.
[2:12:06.000 --> 2:12:14.000]  It's just this this incredible sentence that is like a nuclear bomb. And there was a drag queen story time. This may have been in Austin.
[2:12:14.000 --> 2:12:23.000]  I can't remember where in Texas it was. But this parents were against it. And the teacher said, let's be honest.
[2:12:23.000 --> 2:12:30.000]  A lot of parents don't know what's best for their kids. Sometimes it's up to the community to raise their kids.
[2:12:30.000 --> 2:12:39.000]  And he was talking about his school administrators and their decision to have drag queen story hour at their school, not library.
[2:12:39.000 --> 2:12:45.000]  And you realize that's really what this is all about. The state wanting to raise our kids here in New York.
[2:12:45.000 --> 2:12:50.000]  De Blasio is saying we should have after school programs. So they're there till 7 p.m.
[2:12:50.000 --> 2:12:54.000]  Let's take these young kids that would love to be out there outside throwing a ball around.
[2:12:54.000 --> 2:13:00.000]  They're stuck in a desk indoctrinated. We'll pay for their breakfast. We'll pay for their lunch. We'll take care of their immunization.
[2:13:00.000 --> 2:13:04.000]  We'll make sure the parents don't know. We'll make sure there's a movement.
[2:13:04.000 --> 2:13:11.000]  Remember this was last year where they said if a boy wants to be a girl at school, he can do that and we won't tell the parents.
[2:13:11.000 --> 2:13:16.000]  He can have a secret life as a girl and we won't tell the parents. They're going above our heads.
[2:13:16.000 --> 2:13:23.000]  And that's that's what globalism is. As soon as you can strip the parents power, then the state controls everyone.
[2:13:23.000 --> 2:13:28.000]  Let's go back and they can put that photo of the elderly man in a clown out foot.
[2:13:28.000 --> 2:13:33.000]  These people look scarier than Rob Zombie's devil's rejects.
[2:13:33.000 --> 2:13:38.000]  The scariest looking Nerdy Wells Hollywood can come up with. I see the video.
[2:13:38.000 --> 2:13:42.000]  It's like nightmare it the clown demon creatures.
[2:13:42.000 --> 2:13:46.000]  And now the two things the children ride horsey and lay on top them.
[2:13:46.000 --> 2:13:49.000]  The mothers are obviously all getting off on the sickness of this.
[2:13:49.000 --> 2:13:57.000]  I mean, my God, where are they going next? Where that? What? How did we wake up in this alternate dimension where people that are scarier looking than it?
[2:13:57.000 --> 2:14:03.000]  The clown are being given in some cases unannounced appearance access to elementary students on career day.
[2:14:03.000 --> 2:14:12.000]  Well, it's really the decay of education in general where we're living in an epoch of mental obesity where people are in curious and they'll just take any narrative you throw at them.
[2:14:12.000 --> 2:14:20.000]  So that enables powerful people to come up with a Trojan horse like I'm Antifa. I'm anti fascist.
[2:14:20.000 --> 2:14:26.000]  Oh, OK, that sounds good. Or, you know, gay kids feel terrible about themselves and they get bullied.
[2:14:26.000 --> 2:14:31.000]  So we should make them feel OK. And so they don't kill themselves. And you go, oh, yeah, that sounds pretty good.
[2:14:31.000 --> 2:14:38.000]  So they start with that reasonable concept and then they start pushing it and saying, let's give them hormone blockers.
[2:14:38.000 --> 2:14:47.000]  Let's have bizarre perverted drag queens in there. And the ultimate agenda is not stopping gays from being bullied or preventing fascism.
[2:14:47.000 --> 2:14:56.000]  The ultimate agenda is to destroy the concept of normal. So these weirdos like the guy I started this discussion with in the slip and the sneakers.
[2:14:56.000 --> 2:15:04.000]  So those weirdos can feel normal. They're all perverts. Mika Rhodes, one of the head guys in in Portland's Antifa was just freed.
[2:15:04.000 --> 2:15:13.000]  No sentence at all for raping several couples, underage couples, boys and girls. This is what they're ultimately about.
[2:15:13.000 --> 2:15:18.000]  Oh, and all the time they'll have some character who looks like the Joker caught doing crimes. It'll be an ugly dude.
[2:15:18.000 --> 2:15:26.000]  They go, it's OK. He's trans. Who died and gave these people all the keys to the city because you're like a methhead devil whisperer that dresses like a clown.
[2:15:26.000 --> 2:15:38.000]  You go in a restaurant or a store and they go, hey, guys, come over. It's ma'am. It's ma'am. I mean, it is. It is the inmates running the asylum.
[2:15:38.000 --> 2:15:46.000]  Yeah, we've always had inmates. We've always had weirdos, but it's only since Trump that they become mainstream.
[2:15:46.000 --> 2:15:51.000]  And I think the impetus is they hate Trump so much. Trump derangement syndrome.
[2:15:51.000 --> 2:15:53.000]  Hold on. Stay there. Stay with us.
[2:15:53.000 --> 2:15:59.000]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain, the hottest financial sector without all the speculation.
[2:15:59.000 --> 2:16:04.000]  No, enjoy a 27% annualized payment each month without the ups and downs of Bitcoin.
[2:16:04.000 --> 2:16:12.000]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[2:16:12.000 --> 2:16:20.000]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[2:16:20.000 --> 2:16:31.000]  Non-security IPO or note, blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each month.
[2:16:31.000 --> 2:16:41.000]  Don't miss this one. Take your claim today. Call 800-600-3388. That's 800-600-3388. These valuable lease contracts won't last long.
[2:16:41.000 --> 2:16:46.000]  Call now 800-600-3388. 800-600-3388.
[2:16:46.000 --> 2:16:53.000]  Equipment offer poses a financial risk to owners consult with financial professionals before purchasing not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an offering document.
[2:16:53.000 --> 2:16:58.000]  Fellow Patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of BlackRifleRealEstate.com.
[2:16:58.000 --> 2:17:04.000]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the out-left sanctuary state until one day I chose to lead my family to freedom.
[2:17:04.000 --> 2:17:12.000]  Today we live on a sustainable 20-acre homestead where we shoot, hunt, garden and homeschool our children without the tyranny of the nanny state looking over us.
[2:17:12.000 --> 2:17:17.000]  If you're ready to flee the city to the freedom of Idaho or Montana, our BlackRifleRealEstate team is here to help.
[2:17:17.000 --> 2:17:43.000]  Go to BlackRifleRealEstate.com. That's BlackRifleRealEstate.com.
[2:17:47.000 --> 2:18:00.000]  I would thank you for everything you've done for the InfoWare, but I know you're like me. You don't want my thanks.
[2:18:00.000 --> 2:18:07.000]  You want victory over the globalist and these devil worship and child molesters, and you want them off your back and off your children's back.
[2:18:07.000 --> 2:18:11.000]  You know what? I'm the same way, and that's why we're on the same damn team.
[2:18:11.000 --> 2:18:20.000]  And it's why InfoWars has been delivering time and time again when it's clutch time to focus the people on taking action against the globalist,
[2:18:20.000 --> 2:18:26.000]  because I'm committed to a future for humanity, and I know you are as well.
[2:18:26.000 --> 2:18:34.000]  So thank you in 2019 for standing with us because you are the InfoWare, and I want to thank you for committing to stand with us in 2020 however you can.
[2:18:34.000 --> 2:18:43.000]  From the bottom of my heart, from my family, and from the great crew at InfoWars, I want to thank you all because you are the InfoWare, and you know that's not just words, that's reality.
[2:18:43.000 --> 2:18:54.000]  You have made history. We have made history together. InfoWars.com only has power because of you, and I suggest you use it.
[2:18:54.000 --> 2:19:06.000]  Knock on wood. I am not tempting fate, but everybody around the office, especially folks that have worked there a long time, have noticed that I really don't ever get sick.
[2:19:06.000 --> 2:19:15.000]  Now, again, I might get sick tomorrow because I just made that statement. I'm not tempting fate. I'll say that again because I am superstitious when it comes down to that.
[2:19:15.000 --> 2:19:29.000]  I really thank the good Lord for the Constitution I've been given, but up until about eight, nine years ago when I started taking X2 and the products at InfoWars Life, I still got sick every couple of years.
[2:19:29.000 --> 2:19:44.000]  And I still get sore throats from allergies and pollen and things like that, but now that I religiously take the products at InfoWars Life, the highest quality supplements you're going to find out there, I just never get a fever anymore.
[2:19:44.000 --> 2:19:54.000]  It's probably been three, four years since I've had a fever. It's just crazy. So I chalk it up to genetics and the great products.
[2:20:15.000 --> 2:20:26.000]  Waging War on Corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[2:20:26.000 --> 2:20:44.000]  If men dressed like goblin vampires and space aliens, calling themselves drag queens, can have their will of your children, then the globalists can get away with anything. And that's what's happening.
[2:20:44.000 --> 2:21:00.000]  And it's really weird, like San Francisco has this giant human feces problem, so does Portland. And then it turns out, it's even on the newscast, it's like a sacrament. People go, oh, it's so great how in Portland we defecate wherever we want city council women say, and big fat men crap everywhere.
[2:21:00.000 --> 2:21:16.000]  It's like demonic three-year-olds or something have invaded. I want to shift into the really demonic three-year-olds. Ilhan Omar, the squad, all their bizarre laughing and giggling and siding with Iran, and that's why you're on today, Gavin.
[2:21:16.000 --> 2:21:32.000]  But what do you sum up this craziness? And like I've been asking, we've been coming on the show for years. What is peak craziness? Is there any peak craziness? Because we go out on the street and cover leftist, they're just becoming more insane.
[2:21:32.000 --> 2:21:48.000]  How about there's a horrific hellhole called Somalia, and they have these warlords who have taken over the country are killing their own people. We send them aid, but the warlord keeps all the aid and the people starve.
[2:21:48.000 --> 2:22:03.000]  So we send in Black Hawk down. We send in military specialists to go in there and take out these warlords and get the aid to the people. And there's a little girl there, a little 11-year-old girl, Ilhan Omar.
[2:22:03.000 --> 2:22:15.000]  We take her back as a refugee and set her up. She gets to be in a Muslim community. No real push to assimilate. You can keep your language, keep your culture. Hey, marry your brother and bring him in.
[2:22:15.000 --> 2:22:28.000]  And you know what? We'll get you elected. You can be in office. And what's your take away from that? America sucks. 9-11 was someone doing something. You want to talk about war? I'm the one with PTSD.
[2:22:28.000 --> 2:22:37.000]  I've had it really rough. And while you talk about all the other soldiers, including the ones who saved me and brought me here, I'm going to chat with my friends and smirk and laugh.
[2:22:37.000 --> 2:22:45.000]  She is an ingrate immigrant. She is an emigrate. And this mentality is becoming all too common.
[2:22:45.000 --> 2:22:51.000]  Well, I've made the point that she and others, if they hate America so much, you go back to Somalia and that they'd probably be killed or raped within hours.
[2:22:51.000 --> 2:22:59.000]  And the news is like, Jones hopes Ilhan Omar is raped. I didn't say that. I said, you're fleeing that culture that's so hellish.
[2:22:59.000 --> 2:23:07.000]  And then you always come here and lecture me how you're superior. And I've got to bow down to you. And it's insane.
[2:23:07.000 --> 2:23:18.000]  And her smirking and strutting. And like you said, she never worked a day in her life. Total welfare her whole life. Now she struts around with a tiny little head telling us what to do.
[2:23:18.000 --> 2:23:30.000]  She's so smug. She's like a smug little bird in a headdress who laughs in the face of the country that saved her life. It's like Colin Kaepernick where he's left on the road by his black parents.
[2:23:30.000 --> 2:23:39.000]  A white family picks him up and the takeaway is white people suck. America sucks. You know who's to blame for this is us. Americans, the left.
[2:23:39.000 --> 2:23:51.000]  Our schools in Jockton and our children tell them America sucks. Tell them it was this country built on slavery stolen from the Indians. And eventually that permeates the entire country until immigrants come here.
[2:23:51.000 --> 2:24:00.000]  And they go, how should I act? What will make me normal? And they go, oh, this is America. So what you do here is you crap on America and say it sucks and laugh when they talk about our veterans.
[2:24:00.000 --> 2:24:08.000]  OK, I'll do that. I want to be normal. We've normalized this in great attitude and the immigrants are picking up on it.
[2:24:08.000 --> 2:24:18.000]  They're trying to one up each other and talk about how much America sucks and it was never great, never be great. And instead of immigrants coming here wanting to be part of the nation and making it stronger, some are converting to this.
[2:24:18.000 --> 2:24:29.000]  But a lot of them are beginning to revolt to it. How do you see this playing out in the next 298 days? The election, Trumps to win, Trumps to lose. What's your forecast?
[2:24:29.000 --> 2:24:44.000]  Well, middle America's pissed off. The Rust Belt has had enough. And though Ilhan Omar types dominate the screen, they dominate social media, they dominate the news cycle. You look at Twitter and it's all her attitude.
[2:24:44.000 --> 2:25:01.000]  They're 80 percent of the media. They're only about 10 percent, 10 to 20 percent of the populace. The rest only care about their family, the safety of their kids and jobs. And these people, these left wing lunatics who are pro pedophile obviously don't care about any of that.
[2:25:01.000 --> 2:25:14.000]  They care about no borders, no wall USA at all. And that's a losing strategy. So we're going to see an absolute landslide and heads are going to going to explode. You know, in that movie, the Kingsman at the end, all the elitist heads explode.
[2:25:14.000 --> 2:25:27.000]  Yes. And there's these sort of brightly colored heads. And that's what it's going to be like when Trump wins in November. It's going to be absolute implosion. You thought that the last election was bad. Everyone is going to be like that.
[2:25:27.000 --> 2:25:31.000]  Chick screaming. No, I dread it.
[2:25:31.000 --> 2:25:39.000]  I want you to do one more segment with us because I want to get into how the Democrats could grab the victory from the jaws of defeat.
[2:25:39.000 --> 2:25:46.000]  We're going to do it now. We've got about three or four minutes left. But first off, I'm a big fan of censored TV. I'm a member and I really like it.
[2:25:46.000 --> 2:25:56.000]  And I just love what you're doing because we're not supposed to exist anymore, much less thrive. And I know you add more shows and successful censored TV. Tell us about that.
[2:25:56.000 --> 2:26:11.000]  Well, it's become the only option. You know, we've been pushed out of social media. We've been canceled. And so we have to build these pirate ships, as Adam Karola calls them, and have layers and layers of encryption and and collecting money is a massive.
[2:26:11.000 --> 2:26:25.000]  I mean, we can't raise money for people for defense funds if they're Trump supporters. So we're building these tanks. And I think the left is saying, see, he's not canceled. He's still going. No, we managed to survive despite your mob rule.
[2:26:25.000 --> 2:26:37.000]  The ship in the matrix that jacks in and, you know, it goes in and gets attacked. We have to go in an armored vehicle now to events because they literally throw bottles at us. And again, it's just the listeners get it that literally we're not supposed to exist anymore.
[2:26:37.000 --> 2:26:45.000]  Only they are holding up censored TV info wars.com. This is a act of resistance just still being on air.
[2:26:45.000 --> 2:26:56.000]  I will never stop. I will never stop telling the truth. They can't stop us. We will. We will get fired and get in trouble, but we're brave and we'll never stop fighting.
[2:26:56.000 --> 2:27:03.000]  By the way, you got down. They totally be platforming and put your buddies in prison or trying to put you in jail. They're trying to do that to me as well. I'll do it to Roger Stone.
[2:27:03.000 --> 2:27:10.000]  But then you've come back even stronger. I've noticed you're even stronger than ever. Or am I wrong to say this is really battle hardened you?
[2:27:10.000 --> 2:27:21.000]  Yeah, well, it's sort of the history of Scotland. You know, they were under siege for 600 years from England, and once you couldn't hack it or died, and the ones who enjoy conflict kept reading.
[2:27:21.000 --> 2:27:33.000]  And I'm at the point now that I am angrier than ever and more eager to fight than ever. I think I have to convert my wife because she was always a lefty and a vegan and she vote for Hillary.
[2:27:33.000 --> 2:27:43.000]  And then she's all the way to left was behaving and threatening our family. And she just said F this. I'm independent at best. I'm done with my own party. I want to fight too.
[2:27:43.000 --> 2:27:49.000]  And once you get your wife on board and your whole family's there, then you're stoppable behind every great man is a great woman.
[2:27:49.000 --> 2:27:56.000]  I want to talk about that too, because I know a lot of people that are liberals because liberals are good, not leftist, and they are totally done.
[2:27:56.000 --> 2:28:05.000]  And I agree just like in Brexit, they told all these working party people that were, you know, in the Labor Party, you're you're Nazis because you don't think England's bad.
[2:28:05.000 --> 2:28:11.000]  Well, they just lost by a massive landslide lost about 40% of their party. It's a total political realignment.
[2:28:11.000 --> 2:28:21.000]  As you said, people that are good Americans being told they're bad because they don't hate their country are absolutely pissed and waking up.
[2:28:21.000 --> 2:28:30.000]  The left is their own worst enemy. If you want to win, then don't encourage radicals like the Goon Squad. Focus on health care.
[2:28:30.000 --> 2:28:40.000]  Focus on infrastructure. Things that the right is not doing well. Mock Trump for not building a wall. Be a moderate, normal lefty, but they don't do that.
[2:28:40.000 --> 2:28:48.000]  Like Jeremy Corbyn in Britain was calling everyone a Nazi and defending Palestine and saying Jews are a scourge and are the real property.
[2:28:48.000 --> 2:28:54.000]  Stay there. Let's come back. Stay with us. You have them again. It's in your call. Stay with us.

[2:29:55.000 --> 2:30:02.000]  I love watching David Knight in the morning. I love tuning in to Owen Schroyer. I love all the other shows we do here, but I'll be honest with you.
[2:30:02.000 --> 2:30:07.000]  We run during the breaks a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads.
[2:30:07.000 --> 2:30:12.000]  So you think you don't want to hear an ad? I don't want to hear an ad. But here's the bottom line.
[2:30:12.000 --> 2:30:17.000]  We're barely paying the bills here, and I want to expand the face of the globalists not contract. I don't want them to win.
[2:30:17.000 --> 2:30:26.000]  So listen, you've got this guarantee for me. We sell enough product, we'll have less ads and less plugs, and we'll expand and really give the globalists around for their money.
[2:30:26.000 --> 2:30:33.000]  But we've got products you already really need, like DNA Force Plus, X2. These will change your life. Go check out the turmeric products.

[2:31:15.000 --> 2:31:21.000]  They told us that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[2:31:21.000 --> 2:31:32.000]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[2:31:32.000 --> 2:31:46.000]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[2:31:46.000 --> 2:31:55.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to Infowarslive.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[2:31:55.000 --> 2:32:06.000]  Sunday was supposed to be the last day that we could offer store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points. It was 75% off with our big year in sale, because a lot of the products have already sold out.
[2:32:06.000 --> 2:32:15.000]  Most of the others are about to sell out. But quite frankly, I've been working on so many big stories that are breaking right now that I have not come up with new specials.
[2:32:15.000 --> 2:32:25.000]  And we're already so close to selling out all these products that I'm just going to go ahead and keep the sale going for two more days, and we're going to basically sell out of all of our major product lines.
[2:32:25.000 --> 2:32:33.000]  It'll take weeks, months for them all to come back in. Some come in in weeks, some come in in like three months. A lot of stuff's coming back in next week.
[2:32:33.000 --> 2:32:45.000]  So I've just decided because of the inventory issues and all the rest of it, and because some of these we're selling at losses, are making people buy a lot of other stuff, and we are making a profit. So I'm going to just keep the sale going, but only for 48 hours maximum.
[2:32:45.000 --> 2:33:05.000]  And then we've got to stop it, infowarstore.com, year end, now 2020 mega blowout sale, infowarstore.com, biggest sales we're ever going to have.
[2:33:15.000 --> 2:33:26.000]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news today. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:26.000 --> 2:33:41.000]  Okay, I want to bring up somebody who truly is a has been, and that's Cenk Uger running for Congress. And they constantly run stories saying Alex Jones is off the air, Alex Jones is a loser, Alex Jones has been.
[2:33:41.000 --> 2:33:54.000]  Well, none of that's true. And I'm not going to go into a whole listing of it, but this broadcast is organic. It's independent. And in many ways, it's more successful than ever, despite the suppression, because we can survive during the suppression.
[2:33:54.000 --> 2:34:04.000]  It goes into legend category with folks out there and they really see is everything we talked about comes and turns out to be accurate. Our credibility goes up and that goes for everybody.
[2:34:04.000 --> 2:34:17.000]  Again, it's all the liberty movement. We've been spot on because we're just analyzing reality. But I saw a month ago when the tape came out with him saying if I was a dictator, you know, we'd have sex with animals or whatever.
[2:34:17.000 --> 2:34:27.000]  And I forgot about it. And then for some reason, one of the crew the other day was looking at it and had it up on a big screen, you know, TV editing it for some thing that we're doing.
[2:34:27.000 --> 2:34:40.000]  And the way his eyes sparkle and the way he really acts really pervy. He's obviously getting sexually excited when he talks about pleasuring an animal.
[2:34:40.000 --> 2:34:48.000]  And if he was dictator of the world, and I'm just saying, folks, he doesn't look like a pedophile. He looks like somebody that has sex with animals.
[2:34:48.000 --> 2:34:57.000]  I mean, if I was going to cast somebody in Hollywood that like, hey, lock your dog to your dog, your cat, you know, the young turds guys here, it'd be him.
[2:34:57.000 --> 2:35:06.000]  And I don't bring this up to be, you know, caddy or make a joke out of it, even though it's funny. All these places, these Portland and everywhere, they're trying to legalize bestiality.
[2:35:06.000 --> 2:35:25.000]  So again, what's wrong with these people? So I thought we'd slow this down for radio listeners, for TV viewers, though, watch his face, because if I was on here talking about my wife and talking about just really intimately, it would be creepy if I said the way he said it about my wife.
[2:35:25.000 --> 2:35:38.000]  He's just like, oh, it's a pleasure. I mean, but it's a pleasure that that possum. Oh, and so again, I'm gonna get them again. It's just a take on this. Here it is.
[2:35:38.000 --> 2:35:59.000]  I believe that I am going, if I were the rule, the benevolent dictator of the world, I would legalize bestiality where you are giving. You are your pleasuring animal.
[2:35:59.000 --> 2:36:05.000]  You see what I'm saying? Okay. Okay.
[2:36:05.000 --> 2:36:20.000]  Look at that disgusting mouth. Lock up your dogs, lock up your cats, your turtle, your baby crocodile, your, Gavin, I don't mean to go down this road, but I mean, just like they all seem to be going crazy. What's happening with them?
[2:36:20.000 --> 2:36:29.000]  Well, what just happened there with his voice? This happens with a lot of demons. They have like 24 hours. They're allowed to be out, but then they have to go back in and recharge.
[2:36:29.000 --> 2:36:38.000]  And if they go beyond that, it's like a Cinderella thing and their voice, their human voice starts to fade.
[2:36:38.000 --> 2:36:46.000]  And that's his true demon voice coming out. He probably gotten a lot of trouble when he went back to the underworld for blowing his cover.
[2:36:46.000 --> 2:37:04.000]  By the way, this is your incredible comedy. You're really a comic. This is your satire. They'll probably have somebody fact check this and say, no, it was slowed down. What you did is called satire. We're not actually saying that he uncloaked there and that his demon battery was low.
[2:37:04.000 --> 2:37:16.000]  Yeah, they're not. That's the thing about the new left. They're against art and color and fun and hyperbole and and jokes. And as Orwell said, within every joke is a tiny revolution.
[2:37:16.000 --> 2:37:26.000]  And these people don't like jokes. They prefer pedophiles and bestiality and laughing at dead soldiers. I mean, they prefer this depraved culture.
[2:37:26.000 --> 2:37:43.000]  And then they accuse us of being Nazis. We're we're evil. We're we're holding in all the prejudice and it's it's you. You're calling the kettle black because you did the left recognizes that they have these perverted bizarre traits.
[2:37:43.000 --> 2:37:57.000]  Well, the way he for radio listeners, you're luckily missing it. But I mean, obviously, the way he's talking, the mannerisms, the way he talks so slow, creamily. I mean, in the real video, he talks very slow as well.
[2:37:57.000 --> 2:38:12.000]  That's why I slowed down to accentuate that he's literally just fantasizing here, having a wet dream about I mean, I guess the drinking game is what animal is the young Turks founder fantasizing about.
[2:38:12.000 --> 2:38:27.000]  I think he's talking about a dog. I think he was talking about performing oral sex on a dog. I'm going to say a male dog. And he decides on a political talk show, a high priority as far as topics to cover would be is it ethical?
[2:38:27.000 --> 2:38:38.000]  Are you hurting the dog if you're sexually stimulating them? That is number six billion and 32 on my to do list of topics to discuss.
[2:38:38.000 --> 2:38:47.000]  In the crazy left where they don't have anything else going on, they smoke a big bowl and then get in front of the round table and just start pontificating.
[2:38:47.000 --> 2:38:57.000]  I mean, I'm obsessed about having access to our children in closing, getting back to people being persecuted. I have a lot of family that are classical liberals and they don't like Republicans or Democrats.
[2:38:57.000 --> 2:39:09.000]  Now they're all voting Trump. I agree with you that their heads are going to explode when Trump wins in a landslide. But but but what secret, you know, how could Trump sabotage himself?
[2:39:09.000 --> 2:39:17.000]  Because I don't like it when it looks like we're so far ahead that that makes my spidey sense to get really pucker factor.
[2:39:17.000 --> 2:39:32.000]  The only way he can screw this up is capitulation, apologizing, not getting tough on Iran and Syria when they flex their muscles, letting other world leaders boss them around and tell them what to do the way Obama did.
[2:39:32.000 --> 2:39:39.000]  The reason we elected him is because we saw Obama draw a line in the sand and then cower in fear when people called on it.
[2:39:39.000 --> 2:39:53.000]  We saw them attack the embassy in Benghazi and then cower in fear and not retaliate. If he starts behaving like that to try to appease them, then it's like giving a vampire a little taste of your blood thinking he's going to calm down.
[2:39:53.000 --> 2:40:09.000]  Once they get that scent on their nose, they're like rats. Rats are relatively docile until they eat meat. And the second they try to eat meat, they start to bite. And if he gives the left any meat at all, they will become ravenous.
[2:40:09.000 --> 2:40:26.000]  I agree. Who was it, Winston Churchill, that said to paraphrase this quote, that an appeaser is someone that feeds people to the alligator hoping they're last. And when it was Rudger Kipling said that once you start paying a pirate, the bounty always just goes up.
[2:40:26.000 --> 2:40:35.000]  They don't even want it. I think at the end of the day, these betas want to be disciplined. I mean, we give them the reins and what do they do? They crash the car.
[2:40:35.000 --> 2:40:48.000]  We just had the first guy ever to say I'm genderless and register officially as a genderless person just said, yeah, this whole thing is a farce. I'm changing back to mail. This is all a lie.
[2:40:48.000 --> 2:40:55.000]  So it's like giving a six year old the keys to your car. He's just going to crash it. He doesn't really want to drive it. He shouldn't.
[2:40:55.000 --> 2:41:05.000]  Well, it's like Dave Chappelle said at the 90. They keep taking the first amendment. We're going to use the second. And oh, that's my final point, too, as a famous comedian, your own right. I was filmmaker and author and the rest of it.
[2:41:05.000 --> 2:41:18.000]  What does it mean when the top videos are comedians to the face at the Golden Globes saying your pedophiles, your scum, everyone hates you. And that gets five times the views that the Golden Globes got.
[2:41:18.000 --> 2:41:27.000]  I mean, when the comedians are doing that, knowing they'll never be hired there again. I think it is the fact the ship is sunk. The rats aren't leaving. The ship is sunk.
[2:41:27.000 --> 2:41:42.000]  Yes. And that is a perfect example of what Charles Murray describes as coming apart. Ricky Gervais was talking to middle America, the flyover states, the rest of us, and he was telling the elites that we don't believe any of your bull crap anymore.
[2:41:42.000 --> 2:42:01.000]  We we think you're full of it. And they they they hadn't considered that before he totally demystified it. And it was a great example of what's going to win in 2020. And recognizing that the vast majority of America is sick of the globalists sick of the elites and sick of this
[2:42:01.000 --> 2:42:13.000]  celebrity, patronizing celebrity telling us about climate change. How dare you. How dare you. I'm going to put you up against the wall and have you shot.
[2:42:13.000 --> 2:42:26.000]  I should not be here. Gavin, we really appreciate the work you're doing at censored dot TV. And we just love the fact that you're kicking butt out there in so many ways. CNN had to settle with the Covington kids.
[2:42:26.000 --> 2:42:34.000]  It's going forward against the Southern Poverty Evil Center. So it's good to be here with you in 2020, my friend. Yeah, let's do it.
[2:42:34.000 --> 2:42:47.000]  There goes Gavin again. It's all right. I promise Bob Jefferson, Mark Brandon, Trina Patrick, everybody, your calls are straight ahead. And then Matt Bracken on what's coming up with National Gun Registration and
[2:42:47.000 --> 2:43:05.000]  Compensation are the Democrats and Trump doesn't stop and stay with us. It's either happened to every person listening, or it's happened to someone, you know, everybody is well aware of the fact that most people that end up getting
[2:43:05.000 --> 2:43:23.000]  the flu have taken the flu vaccine right before they get it. And they get the worst case of the flu of their life. But still, by concentration camp victims, they line up at the different pharmacies and clinics to get the injections.
[2:43:23.000 --> 2:43:36.000]  It doesn't matter that studies mainline government studies in Canada and Europe show that when you take the flu vaccine, it doubles your chances of getting the flu the next season by lowering your immunity. It goes on and on.
[2:43:36.000 --> 2:43:50.000]  Or the fact that the governments have never guessed the next year's mutation at the flu vaccine has never, ever even worked. But how do you prop up a hoax? You keep the giant hoax going. No wonder we've got one of the worst flu
[2:43:50.000 --> 2:44:10.000]  ceases on record happening right now. The globalists know that I will never willingly give up. I've said it many times, I will never give in. I will never give up, but I could give out. And it's very, very frustrating to see them committing all their crimes against
[2:44:10.000 --> 2:44:28.000]  me, to see evil running rampant like this and to know that most Americans have already been silenced in cyberspace, that most Americans have already been shadow banned by big tech. And to know that most Americans feel powerless and don't realize how much power they
[2:44:28.000 --> 2:44:44.000]  have by spreading the word about newswords.com, infowords.com and band.video. And that people are hungry for the truth now more than ever. And that if you tell people, hey, the band truth they don't want you to have is at infowords.com.
[2:44:44.000 --> 2:44:59.000]  So take heart, folks, they've had to censor everybody and shut everybody down because the truth is powerful and they can't beat us fair and square.
[2:45:15.000 --> 2:45:32.000]  That's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags. The globalists have literally sold their souls to the dark side and they do what they do because they're slaves because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent.
[2:45:32.000 --> 2:45:54.000]  It is up to us who are awake, not the sheep and not the wolves, but the sheepdogs to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants. They fear the fact that we are awake. They fear the fact that we are alive. They fear the fact that we love God. And that's all we ever have to know is that God is in charge.
[2:45:54.000 --> 2:46:14.000]  I keep my eye on the news all the time, but I miss the fact that in late 2019, just about two weeks ago, the CDC and the FDA approved live Ebola vaccine to be given inside the United States and it is an experimental vaccine.
[2:46:14.000 --> 2:46:30.000]  It is live. It's not even attenuated. They've just genetically modified it, so it's supposedly not lethal. Same stuff they did with the Gardasil vaccine that's admittedly killed and made so many. This is just crazy.
[2:46:30.000 --> 2:46:44.000]  And the Congos had the biggest outbreaks of Ebola ever since they started giving the vaccine there in the last few years. Oh, and of course, opening the borders up here and letting people in unvetted the Democrats distribute across the country.
[2:46:44.000 --> 2:46:56.000]  You cannot make up the magnitude of this insanity and it is an attempted Ebola assault on America. This is the New World Order.
[2:46:56.000 --> 2:47:06.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:06.000 --> 2:47:26.000]  It's the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:26.000 --> 2:47:37.000]  Yep, that's it. And I could discipline myself, but why?
[2:47:37.000 --> 2:47:48.000]  I've disciplined myself not to submit to tyranny, did not let them grind me down, but to enjoy the fight to get stronger, not weaker.
[2:47:48.000 --> 2:48:01.000]  And I put a lot of miles on this body in 45 years, but I got to tell you, I could not do what I do without the fish oil, the krill oil, the X2, the X3, the vitamin mineral fusion.
[2:48:01.000 --> 2:48:10.000]  And I mean, I just take a laundry list of the great products because they're what they are. Superfoods and super nutrients, the vaso beats, the Ultra 12.
[2:48:10.000 --> 2:48:25.000]  And it's not a gimmick that I've been so busy with family stuff, legal stuff and news information that I have not in the last week gone and cut new ads and gone and done the research on inventory and what we could still have on special.
[2:48:25.000 --> 2:48:41.000]  So I just said, you know what? They've been telling me for like a week and a half, stop the special, stop the special, stop the special. You're going to sell out of everything. Some of this stuff doesn't come in for two, three months.
[2:48:41.000 --> 2:48:55.000]  It's not doing it because I'm too busy to go do it. And so, and I guess I'm still the one making a lot of decisions around here. Maybe that's the problem. But that's good for you to get really good prices. So there's a whole laundry list of things that have sold out.
[2:48:55.000 --> 2:49:11.000]  But there's also a big list of things that haven't sold out at info or store.com like super silver at 995 alpha power for 60% off super blue fluoride free toothpaste with total silver iodine and tea tree oil 50% off super silver whitening toothpaste that folks love so much as well with that also recalcifies
[2:49:11.000 --> 2:49:30.000]  remineralizes the teeth not calcifies the bad word remineralizes the teeth held up free folks. That is 60% off brain force plus the great new tropic 60% off knockout sleep head 60% off ultra 12% 60% off selenium 60% off all apparel 25% of the percent off.
[2:49:30.000 --> 2:49:48.000]  There's a lot of the perils that cost info or store.com a lot of stuff still up there for sale. The great Alexa pure breeze air filtration for stage iron filters 30% off with free shipping and a bunch of free bumper stickers with each order and and
[2:49:48.000 --> 2:49:52.000]  something else that a caller called in last week with an idea they had.
[2:49:52.000 --> 2:50:01.000]  And I told you it's not even an ad it's a promo we just show people now with my lunch over here.
[2:50:01.000 --> 2:50:06.000]  I wasn't thinking about this. I got too much stuff in here.
[2:50:06.000 --> 2:50:09.000]  It's the only way to do this now is just do it live on air.
[2:50:09.000 --> 2:50:23.000]  If I should go on own show he always likes it he makes the joke they put a wall around the studio that's a bit to show folks like me on there. We have a look I am cute.
[2:50:23.000 --> 2:50:27.000]  We've got a lot of stuff here that I'm going to be announcing in the next few days that if you want to take back America this plan will do it.
[2:50:27.000 --> 2:50:39.000]  So that's going to be announced soon and I got a lot of stuff on the drawing board these these stickers 20 different ones are all being printed up and they look like duct tape goes over your mouth.
[2:50:39.000 --> 2:50:43.000]  They don't stick to you and hurt you like that and take them on and off and they really sometimes silence is golden.
[2:50:43.000 --> 2:50:51.000]  People say why is your mouth covered and they really want to listen to what you have to say basic psychology and it also will telegraph a message to Trump about it.
[2:50:51.000 --> 2:51:01.000]  I'm going to announce the whole plan soon but it's going to have a really, really big effect.
[2:51:01.000 --> 2:51:11.000]  Okay Matt Bracken is coming up and I said I'm going to take your phone calls and very patient and I appreciate you doing that while we have Gavin McInneson with us.
[2:51:11.000 --> 2:51:21.000]  So let's go to Trina in Nebraska Trina you're on the air welcome.
[2:51:21.000 --> 2:51:23.000]  Well hello hello sir how are you today.
[2:51:23.000 --> 2:51:29.000]  I am good talking to you and it's the best of times but also the worst of times.
[2:51:29.000 --> 2:51:35.000]  I feel that I feel that okay so quick question for you when I was a kid and I went to the dentist or whatever.
[2:51:35.000 --> 2:51:51.000]  I have a heart murmur so a hole in my heart whatever I'm sure you know but anyways and they would have me take a moxisilin an hour before they would do my cleaning and they literally would paint my teeth with fluoride.
[2:51:51.000 --> 2:52:03.000]  Now my question to you is were they trying to save their butts on doing that like giving me that a moxisilin because it could cause heart problems or what do you know I didn't know if you would know since your dad's a dentist.
[2:52:03.000 --> 2:52:11.000]  Actually I do know and I'm not giving medical advice here but the dentists are good people 99% of them.
[2:52:11.000 --> 2:52:32.000]  There's been a few dentists that are killing their patients that have been caught injecting them with HIV and stuff but 99% of dentists are really good or working people and they follow what the American Dental Association tells them and then some of them are regular MDs and then they also have those degrees and they follow what the American Medical Association tells them is just seeing his best practices and a lot of them bucket.
[2:52:32.000 --> 2:52:45.000]  And so my dad was always for fluoridation thought it was conspiracy theory even though he knew a lot of stuff until he saw a Canadian dentist that was instrumental in getting Canada fluoridated more than 40 years ago.
[2:52:45.000 --> 2:52:59.000]  Though I didn't know it was hydrofluorosilic acid and it was coming from toxic sources and under law there's waivers in Canada and the US to put a bunch of toxic wastewater in the name of fluoride itself.
[2:52:59.000 --> 2:53:10.000]  They thought it was medical grade fluoride that you basically get out of the ground. I guess calcium fluoride is one type of it that you do need some of and does shrink the teeth.
[2:53:10.000 --> 2:53:20.000]  But you don't drink sunscreen to keep your son from burning. Well you shouldn't drink fluoride to do that. It actually calcifies and causes problems in the teeth and shipping and the rest of it.
[2:53:20.000 --> 2:53:29.000]  And now the American Association eight years ago came out and said indeed children shouldn't be drinking fluoridated water and fluoride is causing calcification.
[2:53:29.000 --> 2:53:36.000]  It's done about below the age 10 I believe was the guideline. But let's expand on that fluoride treatments are very toxic to the body.
[2:53:36.000 --> 2:53:48.000]  But if you're going to paint it directly onto the teeth the molecules do fuse to the enamel and it's a remineralization process especially if you apply something like above sea coral calcium to it.
[2:53:48.000 --> 2:54:03.000]  So that's a real process. So they convinced Dennis that that was what was going on but it was going into the body a different type of fluoride that's an acid that's very reactive and binds the things in the body and attacks fertility and causes cancer and lowers IQs.
[2:54:03.000 --> 2:54:12.000]  That's all American Medical Association last year came out and said OK it's true. It's devastating take it out of the water. Of course they're not eugenics operational lower IQ.
[2:54:12.000 --> 2:54:21.000]  Now when someone has a heart murmur and they're going to do any type of stuff on the gums or whatever. A lot of times they give you that preemptively.
[2:54:21.000 --> 2:54:33.000]  So you don't get an infection in the mouth and also so they think they're getting into some dirty areas may release bacteria that are low oxygen bacteria that can then get into the ventricles of the heart and sometimes eat parts of the heart.
[2:54:33.000 --> 2:54:37.000]  And so they don't want you to get a heart infection at least for my limited knowledge of that. That's what they do.
[2:54:37.000 --> 2:54:45.000]  So that's why I get up here and say and the FDA doesn't come after you on this because it's a fact that when you have.
[2:54:45.000 --> 2:55:00.000]  Nano silver and you have tea tree oil and you have colloidal silver and iodine that that goes in and is so good for your gums and teeth and one of the top causes of heart attacks and systemic infections is rotting teeth.
[2:55:00.000 --> 2:55:10.000]  So if you've got rotting teeth you should have them extracted and get dentures OK or get a partial or a bridge. It's one of the worst things on earth.
[2:55:10.000 --> 2:55:15.000]  It's absolutely horrible. I've got a rotting tooth. I'm going to get out probably next week but I got to go to Virginia.
[2:55:15.000 --> 2:55:21.000]  So if I may wait. So it finally just gave up the ghost and cracked and collapsed. That's OK. I'm getting older. I'm going to have that sucker pulled out.
[2:55:21.000 --> 2:55:31.000]  It's not an implant put over here. My teeth were always perfect a couple years ago. They're starting to go out on me. But but but it's just critical not to leave rotting roots in the body because these deadly bacteria.
[2:55:31.000 --> 2:55:39.000]  The human mouth is even more dangerous and toxic than the Komodo dragon. We have the dirtiest mouth of any land animal because we have a long history.
[2:55:39.000 --> 2:55:50.000]  So much food we eat so many very things we've eaten that over our development we've learned to have a big barrier of toxic bacteria that in the mouth help our body learn
[2:55:50.000 --> 2:56:01.000]  immunities through the gut. So we're serious combat models. Humans are badass. The problem is if you get rotten teeth those can get into the arteries and veins everywhere else and really cause you a big problem.
[2:56:01.000 --> 2:56:09.000]  So that's why keeping your gums clean and getting quarterly cleanings is absolutely paramount for anybody that doesn't want to have a big old fat juicy heart attack.
[2:56:09.000 --> 2:56:19.000]  And so that is why I believe that they were giving you that ahead of doing any tooth work on you because of the increased risk because of the defect in your heart.
[2:56:19.000 --> 2:56:27.000]  Well that makes sense. And I just I had to make sure because my Dennis actually was not a good one. He got caught sex trafficking drug trafficking.
[2:56:27.000 --> 2:56:35.000]  My god. Really bad guy. Yeah. I've seen him downtown. I always joke with my mom. I'm like we go to the mafia Dennis because I've seen him in his family downtown dressed.
[2:56:35.000 --> 2:56:41.000]  Are you crazy. Yeah. I'm in Omaha. That's it. I'm wondering if he's a part of.
[2:56:41.000 --> 2:56:53.000]  Well we just came up with an interview from like 20 years ago with John the camp about the giant child kidnapping rings there that are confirmed and the CIA bases and he was in the CIA and helped run major
[2:56:53.000 --> 2:57:12.000]  counter killer squads for Operation Phoenix but he was against that and help expose it with the CIA director at the time the finder's operation to the CIA expose the CIA and a large node of it is up in Nebraska because the people are so nice and hard working but very naive.
[2:57:12.000 --> 2:57:28.000]  I mean Nebraskans are wonderful nice people. I'm not being patronizing but kind of like Texans real nice but to get them angry but they just don't expect super evil stuff to be going on and yeah Omaha is a major hub of hard core CIA sex
[2:57:28.000 --> 2:57:37.000]  trafficking. All right. Prina. Thank you. In fact we're going to repost that interview. One of my crew members found out the other day at Bandot video today.
[2:57:37.000 --> 2:57:43.000]  I'm Alex Jones. War calls our number four two minutes away.
[2:57:43.000 --> 2:57:53.000]  I want to talk about super silver whitening toothpaste because I hadn't tried it except for maybe the last week and a half and I told Alex I said man this is the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[2:57:53.000 --> 2:57:57.000]  He's like well what are you doing just sitting in here telling me you got to get up there and tell people.
[2:57:57.000 --> 2:58:09.000]  So here I am telling people super silver whitening toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried and I'm 45 years old and I've tried a lot of different toothpaste and it's fluoride free.
[2:58:09.000 --> 2:58:21.000]  I think the big difference the game changer in this is the coral calcium because after I brush my teeth with this they feel so clean and the toothpaste that I don't even like rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this.
[2:58:21.000 --> 2:58:45.000]  It feels so good. It feels like it feels like good things are happening in my mouth. In fact I find myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now because I like the way it feels.
[2:58:45.000 --> 2:58:54.000]  You want to break some globalist ribs. You want to crush some skulls politically. You want to drive ice picks through their eyeballs spiritually. There's nowhere you can spend money.
[2:58:54.000 --> 2:59:12.000]  There's nowhere you can place your bet in a fight where it's going to have more power per dollar. Your bang for your buck here gets you great products at great prices that literally fund the system where the spirit of resistance lives to drive it home to the enemy.
[2:59:12.000 --> 2:59:23.000]  And so it's very simple. If you don't want to be slaves and you want to see the fight taken to the enemy which God wants to see. You see we have to make the effort. 110% God will finish the move.
[2:59:23.000 --> 2:59:29.000]  And I know I need to stay in the fight in the attack, attack, attack. I want to attack. I want to go after the globalists.
[2:59:29.000 --> 2:59:42.000]  And just believe me, ladies and gentlemen, that if you want somebody to commit to you and your family to fight for all of our futures together, you've got to guarantee you keep me in the game. I'm going to bust my ass with everything I got for us, for myself and my family, for your family, because we're in this together.
[2:59:42.000 --> 3:00:00.000]  Info or store dot com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:00.000 --> 3:00:12.000]  We are back. We're going to talk to Bob and Patrick and others and then Matt Bracken is taking over Patrick in Kansas. Thanks for holding her on the air, sir.
[3:00:12.000 --> 3:00:30.000]  Yes, sir. Good talk to you. Thank you, sir. Hey, I just wanted to say about nine months ago, you shot an ad wearing that green polo shirt on a kitchen table with the China cabinet behind you and you're talking about Jesus Christ.
[3:00:30.000 --> 3:00:45.000]  You changed me. You changed my life and everything has been beautiful, beautiful, beautiful since then. So I wanted to thank you for that. And I want to thank you, brother. What was the name of the video because we should we should rear it?
[3:00:45.000 --> 3:01:04.000]  I don't remember. It's been about about nine months ago. It seems like you always have good luck with that long sleeve green polo shirt. But anyways, I would like to hear more from that. I think you are in a unique position to wake people up to Jesus Christ.
[3:01:04.000 --> 3:01:20.000]  And I want to be clear. It doesn't mean that I don't become worldly and evil and explode and act bad because I'm sincere. I just know God's real and I love God. That doesn't mean I'm up here as an example of the most pious, best person around.
[3:01:20.000 --> 3:01:29.000]  Yes, sir. Yesterday was a good example of how the best men can be the most dangerous.
[3:01:29.000 --> 3:01:37.000]  My other topic was the 5G, the expose you had with the health ranger and one other guy about a month ago.
[3:01:37.000 --> 3:01:54.000]  My question is all the information that you and info was put out over 5G, the health concerns and how deadly it is. What is the logical reaction to that? What should we be doing? What is the logical reaction?
[3:01:54.000 --> 3:02:10.000]  Listen, Israel banned it. A couple of states have already banned it in Switzerland. A bunch of other countries are banning it. It's dangerous. It surveils everybody. And we're just so used to the latest innovation and Trump doesn't know. He's told it will hire millions of people.
[3:02:10.000 --> 3:02:13.000]  I just think Trump is dead wrong on this.
[3:02:13.000 --> 3:02:20.000]  Yes, sir. And when the logical reaction to anything becomes terrorism.
[3:02:20.000 --> 3:02:28.000]  I mean, I'll be honest with you. I'm going to probably buy a piece of property somewhere around the country. This is a place to have that isn't my dad's ranch in his Texas. I can get through quicker.
[3:02:28.000 --> 3:02:37.000]  And I'll try to run for office in that area. People to pass a law not to put 5G in or 6G down the road because it's coming into Austin. I'm going to have to move away from this.
[3:02:37.000 --> 3:02:53.000]  You know, to a certain point, people are just going to start shooting these things or climbing them and beating them up with baseball bats. And I'm not saying do that, but I'm telling you, I would think about it. If I move out in the country somewhere and they come and stick it by my property to surveil me and fry me, I'm not putting up with their violence.
[3:02:53.000 --> 3:03:00.000]  I think that's what you're saying is they're assaulting us. Mainline science says it hurts us and they better watch their ass.
[3:03:00.000 --> 3:03:02.000]  Yes, sir. That's perfect. Thank you.
[3:03:02.000 --> 3:03:07.000]  Thank you. God bless. I mean, I'm just not going to lie to anybody. I've already thought this out.
[3:03:07.000 --> 3:03:13.000]  And you know, I'm not going to let him demonize the Second Amendment. So I'll take a chainsaw to it. I'll run over it with an armored tractor.
[3:03:13.000 --> 3:03:17.000]  I'll climb up there with a baseball bat and beat the living snot out of it.
[3:03:17.000 --> 3:03:25.000]  But the best way to do it, maybe a 12 gauge with double lock buck. Just walk right up to it. You start terminating it. But I'm not saying do that.
[3:03:25.000 --> 3:03:33.000]  Because they'll stage something and, you know, shoot at one into a school or something. Oh, terrorists blow things up, you know, BS, man, BS.
[3:03:33.000 --> 3:03:42.000]  The damn stuff's getting banned all over the world. And I'm saying, and listen, I've been around radio transmitters and stuff.
[3:03:42.000 --> 3:03:46.000]  And the engineers will tell you, they'll burn you if you touch them. And that's just another form of this stuff.
[3:03:46.000 --> 3:03:52.000]  Everybody knows that it makes you where you can't sleep. It makes you sick. Fire departments all over are tough guys.
[3:03:52.000 --> 3:03:57.000]  They stick these on top of their buildings to make extra money. The guys are all for it. They all get sick. They can't sleep.
[3:03:57.000 --> 3:04:03.000]  They start bleeding out their asses. I mean, I was watching a documentary about it just the other day. It's a fact.
[3:04:03.000 --> 3:04:08.000]  When you get a school that puts this similar systems on it, stuff that's not even as bad, earlier systems.
[3:04:08.000 --> 3:04:16.000]  And there's a multi-thousand percent increase in cancer. And then it happens at police stations, at fire departments. It's dangerous.
[3:04:16.000 --> 3:04:25.000]  And with any transmitter, I'm not an engineer, but we've had them on. The length of the antenna, every distance out, it becomes half as strong.
[3:04:25.000 --> 3:04:37.000]  So this stuff at a distance, depending on what type, isn't that dangerous. The problem is the 5G is going to be a million hours to start with everywhere, close, frying people.
[3:04:37.000 --> 3:04:42.000]  Everybody knows with high-tension power lines that plants don't grow as well and stuff right around them.
[3:04:42.000 --> 3:04:50.000]  If you live under them, you get cancer. You can't see it, but those power lines basically have energy just blasting through them.
[3:04:53.000 --> 3:05:02.000]  I spend a lot of time reminding the Info Wars family of listeners and viewers that without you, we won't be on the air.
[3:05:02.000 --> 3:05:09.000]  And I spend a lot of time thanking you. But I really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really changing the world for the better
[3:05:09.000 --> 3:05:18.000]  and raising the alarm as modern Paul reveres. But something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are really amazing.
[3:05:18.000 --> 3:05:24.000]  You've got that pledge from me, but you've seen the third-party test out there, the air filtration, the water filtration.
[3:05:24.000 --> 3:05:34.000]  The supplements are all the very best you're going to find out there. And you can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalist this hard.
[3:05:34.000 --> 3:05:44.000]  So it's not a burden to support Info Wars. It really is something that is good for everybody that stands for justice and freedom
[3:05:44.000 --> 3:06:06.000]  and makes your life and your family's life and your children's life so much better. So visit infowarstore.com today.
[3:06:06.000 --> 3:06:15.000]  Now, I don't raise this to go, oh, look, Hollywood talks about me. I raise it to ask, why are they doing it?
[3:06:15.000 --> 3:06:24.000]  Because so many shows have these villainous characters who they then say, oh, this is supposed to be Alex Jones.
[3:06:24.000 --> 3:06:40.000]  And in some of the movies, they say, no, this is Alex Jones. And then I'm engaging in all sorts of criminal activity, fake news, murder for hire, poisoning people, you name it.
[3:06:40.000 --> 3:06:48.000]  That's what Hollywood does. You had a big movie out about child molesters that kidnap and kill kids and the bad guys named Alex Jones, you know, the child molester.
[3:06:48.000 --> 3:06:59.000]  That's because the child molesters are pissed at us. And so I see that JD will go to Bob JD is saying new Netflix show references Alex Jones.
[3:06:59.000 --> 3:07:07.000]  I can't even keep track of all the shows that reference us now. And again, why are they doing it? Because they've been ordered to do it to psychologically
[3:07:07.000 --> 3:07:21.000]  inoculate people against us. Every channel that I looked at or heard about everybody told me on New Year's. I mean, Drew's got, you know, a big hip hop app on his phone.
[3:07:21.000 --> 3:07:30.000]  He doesn't even get news pushes. And he was getting the news pushes about Alex Jones losing a Sandy Hook lawsuit, which wasn't even true.
[3:07:30.000 --> 3:07:41.000]  Why are they doing it? They want to say Alex Jones is losing Alex Jones is losing. What is Tokyo Rose in World War Two? We were dropping atomic bombs on Japan.
[3:07:41.000 --> 3:07:50.000]  And Tokyo Rose was still on AM radio and shortly going Americans are losing your sweethearts are dead. The Imperial ruler has defeated you.
[3:07:50.000 --> 3:07:56.000]  Japanese troops have taken control of the US mainland. Give up GI. And it's the same thing.
[3:07:56.000 --> 3:08:04.000]  It's like Baghdad, Bob in 2003, like Baghdad's almost completely captured. He goes, Oh, we kick Americans to the way they are in the ocean.
[3:08:04.000 --> 3:08:14.000]  The jet flies by and wraps up bombs. Now, I'm not likening it like we're winning that good. But I mean, the fact that they're that obsessed, what are they scared of?
[3:08:14.000 --> 3:08:24.000]  Just red blooded Americans. I'm not that special. I'm just a red blooded America that isn't scared. And I am on a Ben Grimm clobbering time collision course.
[3:08:24.000 --> 3:08:29.000]  Like a juggernaut. And I just don't. And the fact that I just don't care.
[3:08:29.000 --> 3:08:37.000]  They're like, Jones doesn't care about all the threats and the fact they're trying to put a case on him or all the lawsuits. I don't care about me anymore.
[3:08:37.000 --> 3:08:42.000]  You can't do this and think about it. And I'm not I'm nothing.
[3:08:42.000 --> 3:08:56.000]  I mean, you know about wars, but I had family and much that would just basically tell the stories about Vietnam. They had to sit on top phone books and helmets because the helicopters didn't have any shielding. And you just had to fly around all day getting shot at the helicopters blowing up around you and landing and picking
[3:08:56.000 --> 3:09:04.000]  troops up. You just learned to ignore it and land in your co-pollets. What bleeding to death just taking off.
[3:09:04.000 --> 3:09:14.000]  And my uncle, we know until he died, he had like a ridiculous amount of silver stars. It was all the communiques and all the awards he got for. And he never told anybody because he wasn't a hero.
[3:09:14.000 --> 3:09:29.000]  His buddies that died and other helicopters that are getting people were the heroes. And I'm just up here fighting pedophiles from a broadcast. I got armed people guarding me. I'm lucky. I'm not in a helicopter in a country that didn't even need to be invaded for globalists dying.
[3:09:29.000 --> 3:09:42.000]  I don't have my arms and legs blown off like our poor veterans. I'm just here saying get away from our children, leave us alone, New World Order. And that's why when I'm doing is not heroic by any stretch the imagination.
[3:09:42.000 --> 3:09:47.000]  What I'm doing is when somebody's on top of me, I'm getting them off of me.
[3:09:47.000 --> 3:09:59.000]  You ever had that when you're younger, the bullies, four or five of them would sit on you? And I mean, it's happened to me when I was like 10 years old, stuff like that, and start hitting you in the face and beating you up until there's that moment where you just find that crazy strength.
[3:09:59.000 --> 3:10:07.000]  And even though they're five years older than you, six years older, you get up, pick a rock up and, you know, knock them upside their head and they go to the hospital. And then their parents try to sue you, but they can't because they attacked you.
[3:10:07.000 --> 3:10:18.000]  They fear you. You see, you didn't start to fight, but they need to know you're going to finish it and not bow down to their crap anymore. And it's that spirit they can't handle.
[3:10:18.000 --> 3:10:23.000]  So it's true. I take it all serious and I love it. I love all of it.
[3:10:23.000 --> 3:10:29.000]  Now, I try not to be like that because I can get little, little, little violent, a little aggressive and I need to repent.
[3:10:29.000 --> 3:10:38.000]  But I'm on the opposite end of caring about these people or fearing them, okay? Because I'm not going to, that's where I'm comfortable. You understand?
[3:10:38.000 --> 3:10:44.000]  He's going all out. And in fact, I'm mad at myself that I'm not going all out. I'm not fighting hard enough. I don't talk about myself here.
[3:10:44.000 --> 3:10:51.000]  I'm bringing this up and Matt Bragg is coming up next segment. So people understand what they fear because they're scared of this.
[3:10:51.000 --> 3:10:57.000]  You understand? Because they know I'm going to politically spiritually get my hands around their throat of God bless me.
[3:10:57.000 --> 3:11:03.000]  And they know it. They know I'm for real. They know I can't be bought. They know I can't be intimidated and they know I don't care.
[3:11:03.000 --> 3:11:13.000]  You understand that? I don't think I'm invincible either. I don't think I'm invincible. I'm not on a power trip. I'm on fire and they know it.
[3:11:13.000 --> 3:11:21.000]  Because I don't like them. I know who they are. I want them off the children, you understand? And we're going to get them off of them.
[3:11:21.000 --> 3:11:30.000]  And they don't like that because they know I'm coming for them and they know you're coming for them and they know the spirit of vengeance and God is about to pour out upon them.
[3:11:30.000 --> 3:11:38.000]  It's good and it's right and it's strong and they fear it. They fear it now, don't they? Sorry.
[3:11:38.000 --> 3:11:48.000]  That's what they fear. You understand? That's what they fear. So that's why I'm showing them what they fear. What they hate is someone that isn't afraid of them.
[3:11:48.000 --> 3:11:59.000]  JD, what did you see on Netflix? Alex, can you hear me? Yes, sir. Thank you. They fear you because you tell the truth.
[3:11:59.000 --> 3:12:09.000]  They fear you. They attack you. They fear the audience of activists. They demonize you because you tell the truth.
[3:12:09.000 --> 3:12:15.000]  My wife was watching a show on Netflix. It's popular. It's called You.
[3:12:15.000 --> 3:12:29.000]  Two characters are having a conversation. One character was saying his story. The other character discredited him by using your name.
[3:12:29.000 --> 3:12:35.000]  That's right. Alex Jones is the new conspiracy theory word. They just go, oh, Alex Jones.
[3:12:35.000 --> 3:12:45.000]  Do you hear Rachel Maddow giving Alex Jones defense? Exactly. They're trying to take my name and turn it into a symbol of defeat instead of a symbol of victory.
[3:12:45.000 --> 3:12:48.000]  No.
[3:12:48.000 --> 3:12:53.000]  So what else happened? Did that wake your wife up more or less?
[3:12:53.000 --> 3:12:59.000]  I think it woke her up more. She knows who you are. I listen to you every day.
[3:12:59.000 --> 3:13:09.000]  As soon as she saw that, she called me into the room, rewinded it. I watched it and it was, it's right there in front of everybody's face.
[3:13:09.000 --> 3:13:13.000]  You tell the truth. They demonize you because you tell the truth.
[3:13:13.000 --> 3:13:21.000]  They had a whole show on ABC, The Good Doctor, where they say it's Alex Jones and then they say things word for word from the show, but twisted.
[3:13:21.000 --> 3:13:26.000]  And at the end, I admit I'm wrong and I'm a fraud and all this crap. It's unbelievable.
[3:13:26.000 --> 3:13:33.000]  But again, that makes me feel good that we must really be doing a good job. But you know, you're doing a good job and I'm not kissing your ass, JD. It's you.
[3:13:33.000 --> 3:13:43.000]  You guys are keeping us in the game so that info wars and the idea of it, of the bonafide genuineness of it doesn't mean it's perfect, but it's real.
[3:13:43.000 --> 3:13:51.000]  It comes from a place of truth. They want to capture that identity, not have us on air so they can really misrepresent who we are.
[3:13:51.000 --> 3:14:03.000]  They're saying Alex Jones is you, the grassroots person that loves God. That's why they're attacking me because they see info wars as the archetype of you, JD.
[3:14:03.000 --> 3:14:16.000]  Exactly. And truth aligns with truth. That's why I'm here talking to you right now. They can't stop us.
[3:14:16.000 --> 3:14:22.000]  Can you imagine wanting to serve this evil the way they do?
[3:14:22.000 --> 3:14:24.000]  I never.
[3:14:24.000 --> 3:14:28.000]  God bless you, brother. I appreciate your call. I'll try to find the episode of that or there's just too many episodes.
[3:14:28.000 --> 3:14:36.000]  Even keep track of it. It's so slimy to watch Hollywood launch its big stinking tentacles out of our children and in our communities.
[3:14:36.000 --> 3:14:40.000]  It is how much they hate America and how much they hate God.
[3:14:40.000 --> 3:14:50.000]  I can't cut into any more Matt Bracken, so I've done good at calls, but Bob, Jefferson, Mark and Brandon, I'll put you to the head of the line tomorrow.
[3:14:50.000 --> 3:14:56.000]  And I promise they'll don't let me forget tomorrow, guys, to call them first when we open the phones up and give them all a free t-shirt.
[3:14:56.000 --> 3:15:06.000]  Not that they all want a free t-shirt, but they all get a t-shirt to tell us your size and we'll have customer service call you and we'll have that taken care of.
[3:15:06.000 --> 3:15:12.000]  It takes money to keep us on air. They're pissed we're still here. They're trying every dirty trick they can, which I don't have liberty to get into.
[3:15:12.000 --> 3:15:21.000]  And I just get pissed that I'm not fighting them more effectively and it just how corrupt our country's become in the power structure, but that's okay.
[3:15:21.000 --> 3:15:28.000]  That's why we're here. And so I'm beyond delighted and I'm extremely thrilled. I'm extremely thankful.
[3:15:28.000 --> 3:15:37.000]  The problem is, is that God's been turning the voltage on. I mean, the discernment, the focus, the anger, the will is just off the charts.
[3:15:37.000 --> 3:15:43.000]  I know yours is as well. So I keep praying for the power to take on the globalists and you know what? God's given it to me.
[3:15:43.000 --> 3:15:51.000]  God's given it to you. This is it. This isn't a simulation. This is the real deal, baby.
[3:15:51.000 --> 3:16:02.000]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain. The hottest financial sector without all the speculation. No, enjoy a 27% annualized payment each month without the ups and downs of Bitcoin.
[3:16:02.000 --> 3:16:10.000]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[3:16:10.000 --> 3:16:18.000]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[3:16:18.000 --> 3:16:29.000]  Non-security IPO or note, blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each month.

[3:17:21.000 --> 3:17:31.000]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house. I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[3:17:31.000 --> 3:17:38.000]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved. I can help you too.
[3:17:38.000 --> 3:17:52.000]  No taxes you can't pay. Don't wait another day. There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case. Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com. That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[3:18:08.000 --> 3:18:18.000]  Super silver whitening toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried and I'm 45 years old and I've tried a lot of different toothpaste and it's fluoride free.
[3:18:18.000 --> 3:18:30.000]  I think the big difference, the game changer in this is the coral calcium because after I brush my teeth with this, they feel so clean and the toothpaste that I don't even like rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this.
[3:18:30.000 --> 3:18:44.000]  It feels so good. It feels like it feels like good things are happening in my mouth. In fact, I find myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now because I like the way it feels.
[3:18:44.000 --> 3:19:06.000]  I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers who enforce. Your support and your help in rebooting Americana is a challenge to the globalist system of corporate tyranny has really caught hold, not just here in the U.S.
[3:19:06.000 --> 3:19:14.000]  worldwide and President Trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty is amazing as well.
[3:19:14.000 --> 3:19:38.000]  He's still lacking on the big tech censorship, taking action against that in some other areas, but tried to end the wars, boosting our economy, speaking out against communist China. Trump's been doing an amazing job, but now more than ever, we really have to realize that we're being targeted because we are effective and the globalists are beginning to lose their war against humanity in a big way.
[3:19:38.000 --> 3:19:46.000]  And so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them, but it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us.
[3:19:46.000 --> 3:20:12.000]  That's an attempt to demoralize us. We've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy.
[3:20:12.000 --> 3:20:28.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones and now your host, Matt Bracken.
[3:20:28.000 --> 3:20:48.000]  Welcome to 2020. Thanks for having me on, Alex. And in the last segment, Alex is speaking a little bit, you know, what's new about all the constant attacks on him, on his person, becoming the big, the big boogeyman when almost every movie and TV show, you know,
[3:20:48.000 --> 3:20:59.000]  if they need a villain, his name is Alex Jones. I mean, it takes a very strong person to stand up to that. It would be very easy to just duck out by a remote ranch and disappear.
[3:20:59.000 --> 3:21:14.000]  So we all have to appreciate that he's got the strength and fortitude and courage to just stand up and take it. I mean, he must get tired of pulling arrows out of his back, or maybe he just leaves him in there, busts him off and keeps on going.
[3:21:14.000 --> 3:21:26.000]  But I think, and I mean, I hope I'm right in this, that the more he is attacked by the mainstream media, Hollywood and so forth, the greater his legend is.
[3:21:26.000 --> 3:21:43.000]  And I think, you know, by 2020, the only people that buy, you know, the Hollywood garbage, the network television stuff, the only people that buy it are kind of the, you know, first level thinker NPC meme bots, not thinking humans.
[3:21:43.000 --> 3:21:57.000]  And the more that Alex stands up on the skyline, you know, gets out of the trench and exposes himself, I think it serves as an example of courage for other people, myself included.
[3:21:57.000 --> 3:22:09.000]  You know, if Alex can do it, why can't we? Let's not back down. Let's take all the abuse and smile and just keep pushing forward, because we are winning.
[3:22:09.000 --> 3:22:17.000]  And I hope there are a lot of signs that the, you know, that the deep state, the globalists, they're actually coming to a crisis point.
[3:22:17.000 --> 3:22:31.000]  We saw this across the pond with the election of Boris Johnson. This was really unexpected. Like the Trump election, right up until his election, they were saying that he was, you know, barely ahead or it was a toss up.
[3:22:31.000 --> 3:22:42.000]  It was a wipeout of the globalists. You know, the Labor Party, which had just become by the 90s and 2000s, a Labor Party was just socialists.
[3:22:42.000 --> 3:22:49.000]  And they absolutely alienated the middle class, the working class of England, and they were wiped out.
[3:22:49.000 --> 3:22:59.000]  And I think that something like that is gearing up for November of 2020, where I think that there's a chance for a huge landslide for President Trump.
[3:22:59.000 --> 3:23:06.000]  The bots on television can drone on and on against him, but I think our president's doing overall a great job.
[3:23:06.000 --> 3:23:18.000]  Now, specifically talking about the hit on Soleimani, people may be tired of hearing about it, but I think I've got a couple angles on it that are somewhat fresh.
[3:23:18.000 --> 3:23:24.000]  Personally, you know, like they say, victory has a thousand fathers and defeat is an orphan.
[3:23:24.000 --> 3:23:32.000]  Well, if it works, then you're great. It's like going for a trick play in football. When it works, the coach is a genius.
[3:23:32.000 --> 3:23:39.000]  And if it fumbles or gets picked six for a touchdown the other way, then you're the biggest idiot ever.
[3:23:39.000 --> 3:23:43.000]  But in this case, I think that the Soleimani hit was brilliant.
[3:23:43.000 --> 3:23:52.000]  Obviously, they've been following him. They knew his movements and they isolated him right at the Baghdad Airport, where there would be no collateral damage.
[3:23:52.000 --> 3:24:08.000]  They could smoke him with Hellfire missiles, take out not only Soleimani, but the Iraqi head of Soleimani's subordinate militia, and blow him up to kind of a really strong decapitation strike.
[3:24:08.000 --> 3:24:13.000]  And therefore, nobody can say this was really just an assassination of a statesman.
[3:24:13.000 --> 3:24:24.000]  The guys in Iraq, while they're attacking our embassy, while they're rocketing our bases, that puts them on the battlefield as a soldier, legit hit all the way, boom, gone, done.
[3:24:24.000 --> 3:24:30.000]  But people still, I think to this day, they don't really understand how important Soleimani was.
[3:24:30.000 --> 3:24:41.000]  He was absolutely the second or maybe even the most popular in terms of his popularity, or most powerful, rather, in terms of his cult of personality in Iran.
[3:24:41.000 --> 3:24:50.000]  He was, to use a Nazi comparison, he was Heinrich Himmler and Reinhard Heidrich rolled into one.
[3:24:50.000 --> 3:25:00.000]  He was running the proxy war, which has been Iran's form of warfare since they really have declared war on us in 1979 with the Revolution.
[3:25:00.000 --> 3:25:08.000]  He has been running these proxy wars, the Hezbollah's all over the place, Lebanon and elsewhere, Yemen, across the Middle East.
[3:25:08.000 --> 3:25:17.000]  That's Soleimani. He uses a cut out form of warfare where, when we're attacked, it's some, quote unquote, Shia militia.
[3:25:17.000 --> 3:25:30.000]  But that's Soleimani. He has been, like Heidrich was for the Nazis, Heidrich was assassinated in 1942 or 43 in Prague.
[3:25:30.000 --> 3:25:43.000]  Because he was, you know, one of Hitler's greatest sort of lieutenants for exporting the Holocaust or enforcing, you know, the kind of scorched earth Holocaust policy.
[3:25:43.000 --> 3:25:47.000]  He was taking that country to country. He was in Prague when he was assassinated.
[3:25:47.000 --> 3:25:53.000]  Another great general was the Japanese or was the general or rather Admiral Yamamoto.
[3:25:53.000 --> 3:26:02.000]  He was assassinated in the Pacific, I believe, also 42, 43. Yamamoto is 43.
[3:26:02.000 --> 3:26:11.000]  We assassinated him. We learned where he was going to be through collecting intel. We'd broken their codes and we jumped him with P-38 lightenings, shot down his airplane.
[3:26:11.000 --> 3:26:22.000]  And he was the brilliant military strategist of the Japanese, taking him out, took away one of their greatest brains, one of their unifying brains.
[3:26:22.000 --> 3:26:33.000]  So now with Soleimani gone, you've got not only nobody with anything near his personal cult of personality, his popularity.
[3:26:33.000 --> 3:26:38.000]  But his follow-ons now are going to be very worried about exposing themselves.
[3:26:38.000 --> 3:26:49.000]  Part of Soleimani's power was that he was out on the battlefield, so to speak, you know, helicoptering around Iraq, visiting his militia force, so-called militia forces.
[3:26:49.000 --> 3:26:57.000]  And that did him in, that hubris, that pride, that desire to take selfies on the battlefield, that did him in.
[3:26:57.000 --> 3:27:05.000]  And that cult of personality, when it's cut like that, you know, it's a big psychological blow to his followers.
[3:27:05.000 --> 3:27:14.000]  It's debatable inside of Iran just how popular he was, but certainly at least 10 or 20% of the people adored him.
[3:27:14.000 --> 3:27:20.000]  The masses that went out on the street, they weren't all just given meals or paid or threatened.
[3:27:20.000 --> 3:27:30.000]  They really do love him in the same sense that millions of Soviets loved Stalin and millions of brainwashed Chinese loved Mao.
[3:27:30.000 --> 3:27:42.000]  Now 80% of the population is probably quietly glad he's dead, but that doesn't mean that they're suddenly going to rise up and take over the country.
[3:27:42.000 --> 3:27:52.000]  But it does give us some, it's a weak point now for the regime, so it does give us an opening to try to split the mullahs and the radicals.
[3:27:52.000 --> 3:28:06.000]  That would be the IRCG and the Kuds Force, the religious fanatics, split them from the 80% of the country that wished that they could rejoin the family of nations.
[3:28:06.000 --> 3:28:14.000]  And when we come back, I'm going to talk a little bit about some of the positive things that have come out of this and some of the mistakes.
[3:28:14.000 --> 3:28:33.000]  Because it's my opinion, the key to all of this, anything that we attack in Iran, I mean, if we do, hopefully we're on a big pause now, should be gauged and calibrated to split that 10 or 20% of the mullahs from the 80 or 90% of the people.
[3:28:33.000 --> 3:28:40.000]  Anything we do to unify them is a mistake. Anything we do to push them apart is going to help us in the end.
[3:28:40.000 --> 3:28:47.000]  And I'm going to talk a little bit more about this on the other side, then we're going to move on to Richmond, Virginia, January 20th.
[3:28:47.000 --> 3:29:14.000]  And talk about that. I'll be right back.

[3:33:10.000 --> 3:33:28.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. It's Matt Bracken. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:28.000 --> 3:33:49.000]  Okay, I just want to finish up a few thoughts on the Soleimani hit that I haven't really seen spoken of much or read about. And one factor is going back to trying to split the radical leaders of Iran from the average people.
[3:33:49.000 --> 3:33:58.000]  A couple days ago, Trump tweeted out and then he spoke about attacking their cultural targets. And I think this is a huge mistake.
[3:33:58.000 --> 3:34:10.000]  He might have been thinking in terms of trolling the Democrats. The Democrats will flip out and then I'll say, oh, you care more about, you know, artwork than human lives.
[3:34:10.000 --> 3:34:23.000]  That's an easy, you know, that's pretty easy for the American audience. But the way that this played in Iran is absolutely terrible. Because, you know, even secular Iranians and probably the majority of Iranians today are privately secular.
[3:34:23.000 --> 3:34:36.000]  They're not believers. They're ex-Muslims. They can't say, of course. But when you say we're going to blow up, you know, 3000 year old Persian antiquities, that's where you really get them.
[3:34:36.000 --> 3:34:46.000]  Because all Iranians are proud of their Persian heritage. And they have a right to be. These are not stupid, you know, debt scrawny desert Arabs.
[3:34:46.000 --> 3:34:55.000]  These are Persians. They invented chess. You know, they can make their own cruise missiles. Just go on the web and look up Iranian cruise missiles.
[3:34:55.000 --> 3:35:07.000]  They have them from at every size and they're so cheap that they can afford to, you know, send out fleets of these cruise missiles for the price of a fraction of the defense against them.
[3:35:07.000 --> 3:35:20.000]  They're not stupid people. And by saying that we could target Persian Iranian cultural sites, what that does is unify the Iranians against us.
[3:35:20.000 --> 3:35:33.000]  And everything we do should be seen in terms of splitting the hated Iranian leadership that's controlled that country for 40 years from the people who would like to modernize and secularize.
[3:35:33.000 --> 3:35:43.000]  You know, along with that, I keep hearing people like Hannity there saying, we're just going to go in and wipe out their refineries. They've got three big refineries.
[3:35:43.000 --> 3:35:57.000]  That's great. We can do that. No problem. But what that does is affect all Iranians. And in fact, the military would be the least affected because they'll have the most secure supply for petroleum oil lubricants.
[3:35:57.000 --> 3:36:06.000]  The average guy trying to get it at the gas station, he's the one that will suffer the most or the guy who's trying to stay warm in the winter. He's the one that will be affected the most.
[3:36:06.000 --> 3:36:23.000]  So that would be a last resort. That would be down the road to take out the refineries. The targets that you have to take out are the logistic points where the Iranian revolutionary guards could not get out of their motor poles, things like that,
[3:36:23.000 --> 3:36:41.000]  attack their mobility, attack their own Pol sites that are military oriented. Do not go after targets that are going to affect the 80% of the Iranian people. Only target the Mullahs that could force the IRCG.
[3:36:41.000 --> 3:36:54.000]  And something that you've been hearing Kud's force here for the last week or two, people need to know Kud's, Al Kud's, is Jerusalem. Soleimani named his kind of like his SS storm trippers.
[3:36:54.000 --> 3:37:06.000]  They're called the Jerusalem force. So these guys are very bad dudes. They have an objective of not only knocking America out of the Middle East, who cares, I'd like to be gone too.
[3:37:06.000 --> 3:37:18.000]  So they see themselves in a death struggle against Sunni Islam. They want to take over Jerusalem under a Shia flag. That was Soleimani's thing. He is a Shia fanatic.
[3:37:18.000 --> 3:37:28.000]  So yes, we were in a sort of temporary alliance of convenience in Iraq going after ISIS, but that's only because ISIS was Sunni.
[3:37:28.000 --> 3:37:41.000]  They didn't care that ISIS was committing atrocities. The Kud's force commits atrocities. Equally, they just killed something like 1,500 demonstrators, firing live ammo straight into crowds.
[3:37:41.000 --> 3:37:51.000]  No warning shots, no rubber bullets, live ammo into crowds. When something like that's happening, you know the end of the regime is drawing near.
[3:37:51.000 --> 3:38:01.000]  That's similar almost to the last days of the Shah, when the Shah's guards were shooting right into crowds. That's an end stage.
[3:38:01.000 --> 3:38:13.000]  So we need to do everything we can to exacerbate the collapse of the regime and not attack the Iranian people and thereby drive all the Iranians together as a unified force against America.
[3:38:13.000 --> 3:38:30.000]  Now, one last thing, the Ukrainian jet, no doubt it was shot down by their own rocket. I've seen the picture, you probably have seen it, of that forward control head of the missile with the four little fins that's on the front of the missile.
[3:38:30.000 --> 3:38:39.000]  Somebody saw that and took a picture of it, landed somewhere around the aircraft, and no doubt that identifies the actual rocket that did it.
[3:38:39.000 --> 3:38:51.000]  And then you can see on the large pieces of fuselage paneling and wing panel panels, the dead giveaway are these little cut marks that are like four inches long, either straight or triangular.
[3:38:51.000 --> 3:39:03.000]  That's where the frag from the rocket warhead actually cut into the fuselage. The way these missiles work, they'll explode at the closest point of approach.
[3:39:03.000 --> 3:39:11.000]  Meaning, if it's going to miss, because remember, they're also being used to aim against things that can maneuver like a jet fighter.
[3:39:11.000 --> 3:39:23.000]  So they don't assume they're going to make a dead hit. But at the closest point of approach, no matter whether that's a hit or a near miss, it's going to explode and it sends out a cloud of shrapnel.
[3:39:23.000 --> 3:39:36.000]  And that's the giveaway or those little cut marks that you'll look at and see in the pictures of big wing sections and fuselage sections. That's the dead giveaway, that in the motorhead, the control head of the rocket.
[3:39:36.000 --> 3:39:47.000]  So what does that mean? It means that the Iranians are very panicked. They've got weapons systems on automatic. They're in a very vulnerable stage right now.
[3:39:47.000 --> 3:40:01.000]  Anything we do has to be designed to divide their leadership from the people. Anything that drives the people and the leadership together is a mistake, like even talking about targeting Persian cultural sites.
[3:40:01.000 --> 3:40:15.000]  Big mistake or taking out the refineries. Big mistake. Everything that we do has to be targeted against the Mullahs, the Quds Force, the IRCG. That's the way we win in Iran.
[3:40:15.000 --> 3:40:27.000]  Trump has said we're not going to let them have a nuke. That's not going to be easy with this regime. I mean, that would take a huge war with the penetrating missiles and so forth.
[3:40:27.000 --> 3:40:36.000]  The way that we stop them from getting a nuke is regime change, but it has to be done very, very carefully and craftily.
[3:40:36.000 --> 3:40:52.000]  And talking about taking out refineries or cultural sites is exactly the wrong tactic. Okay, I'm going to switch gears now and start talking about what I think is the other biggest story, which is Virginia.
[3:40:52.000 --> 3:41:14.000]  I've written two pretty lengthy, in-depth pieces in the last week. One is called Virginia, the 2020 Virginia Showdown. It's up at American Partisan, and the other one is also at American Partisan where I write, and it's called Richmond, the mother of all buffalo jumps.
[3:41:14.000 --> 3:41:31.000]  And some people are, you know, wondering what I'm thinking about that I'm kind of being a Debbie Downer on Richmond, but the more I've been studying it, the more it's shaping up like a, you know, going to be a Charlottesville type of an event.
[3:41:31.000 --> 3:41:42.000]  And I know that people's hearts are in the good, in the right place. I know that people want to do something. They absolutely, you know, want to fight back against what's happening coming out of Richmond and northern Virginia.
[3:41:42.000 --> 3:41:56.000]  That tiny part of Virginia with the high population that runs the entire state for the time being. But I'm telling you, charging into Richmond in force is going to be a mistake.
[3:41:56.000 --> 3:42:10.000]  I keep reading, people saying, if I see an antifa pull a club, I'm going to pull my gun. Or, you know, we're just going to overwhelm them when there's 30,000 of us around the courthouse, around the capital.
[3:42:10.000 --> 3:42:19.000]  They're just going to have to pay attention. I mean, I understand people's desire to do something, and I know that their heart is in the right place.
[3:42:19.000 --> 3:42:29.000]  But the more that I study this and I read these kind of comments, the more I think, you know, this is shaping up to be what I would call a buffalo jump.
[3:42:29.000 --> 3:42:42.000]  And when we come back, I'm going to talk about that. And we're also going to look at a two minute video showing how the mainstream media is going to increasingly portray this Richmond, January 20th rally.
[3:42:42.000 --> 3:42:51.000]  This is what the national media is going to be showing leading up to the actual day. And we'll be back in a couple minutes and talk about Virginia.
[3:42:51.000 --> 3:43:13.000]  We have a new product and we got several thousand of these in and they're going to sell out in a few days at the rate we're selling them. I want to thank the listeners for getting it. But this really is a game changing toothpaste.
[3:43:13.000 --> 3:43:26.000]  These are both excellent toothpaste concentrates that don't have fillers. People love it. This is a whitening toothpaste that also has the above sea coral calcium that also cleans but also re mineralizes the teeth.
[3:43:26.000 --> 3:43:45.000]  Then it has the patented silver salt, silver in it to knock out the bacteria that cause ginsivitis. This is all proven. You can make claims with this. But I have to tell you, no one has a toothpaste this good for knocking out the bacteria, the viruses and cleaning the teeth in a healthy way that doesn't strip away the enamel.
[3:43:45.000 --> 3:43:51.000]  So we're really proud of it. It funds the operation infowarstore.com. That's why we're still on air. Thanks to you.
[3:43:51.000 --> 3:44:09.000]  Infowars life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine. Introducing pollen block. We have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[3:44:09.000 --> 3:44:29.000]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses. They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[3:44:29.000 --> 3:44:43.000]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[3:44:43.000 --> 3:44:52.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[3:44:52.000 --> 3:45:04.000]  Knock on wood. I am not tempting fate, but everybody around the office, especially folks that have worked there a long time, have noticed that I really don't ever get sick.
[3:45:04.000 --> 3:45:13.000]  Now, again, I might get sick tomorrow because I just made that statement. I'm not tempting fate. I'll say that again, because I am superstitious when it comes down to that.
[3:45:13.000 --> 3:45:27.000]  I'm very thankful for the good Lord, for the Constitution I've been given. But up until about eight, nine years ago, when I started taking X2 in the product's enforced life, I still got sick every couple of years.
[3:45:27.000 --> 3:45:42.000]  And, you know, I still get sore throats from allergies and pollen and things like that. But now that I religiously take the products in enforced life, one of the highest quality supplements you're going to find out there, I just never get a fever anymore.
[3:45:42.000 --> 3:45:53.000]  It's probably been three, four years since I've had a fever. It's just crazy. So I chalk it up to genetics and the great products.
[3:45:53.000 --> 3:46:04.000]  Sunday was supposed to be the last day that we could offer store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points. It was 75% off with our big year in sale, because a lot of the products have already sold out.
[3:46:04.000 --> 3:46:12.000]  Most of the others are about to sell out. But quite frankly, I've been working on so many big stories that are breaking right now that I have not come up with new specials.
[3:46:12.000 --> 3:46:19.000]  And we're already so close to selling out all these products that I'm just going to go ahead and keep the sale going for two more days.
[3:46:19.000 --> 3:46:29.000]  And we're going to basically sell out of all of our major product lines. It'll take weeks, months for them all to come back in. Some come in in weeks, some come in in like three months.
[3:46:29.000 --> 3:46:37.000]  A lot of stuff's coming back in next week. So I've just decided, because of the inventory issues and all the rest of it, and because some of these were selling losses,
[3:46:37.000 --> 3:46:43.000]  are making people buy a lot of other stuff, and we are making a profit. So I'm going to just keep the sale going, but only for 48 hours maximum.
[3:46:43.000 --> 3:47:03.000]  And then we've got to stop at infowarstore.com, the year end, now 2020 mega blowout sale, infowarstore.com, biggest sales we're ever going to have.
[3:47:14.000 --> 3:47:22.000]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones with Matt Bracken.
[3:47:26.000 --> 3:47:32.000]  All right, the next 10 minutes is going to be my big Virginia segment.
[3:47:32.000 --> 3:47:40.000]  I went to the University of Virginia incidentally in the 70s, graduated from UVA right there in Charlottesville in 79.
[3:47:40.000 --> 3:47:47.000]  And I would encourage anybody thinking about going to Richmond, please study up on what happened in Charlottesville.
[3:47:47.000 --> 3:47:56.000]  It's very instructive. The vast majority of the people that went there to defend the Robert E. Lee statue were just good people. I get it.
[3:47:56.000 --> 3:48:06.000]  Their hearts were in the right place, but they had a bunch of things working against them, despite their great intentions, their honest, wonderful intentions.
[3:48:06.000 --> 3:48:12.000]  There are a few things that were just working against them, and the same things are going to work against them in Richmond.
[3:48:12.000 --> 3:48:31.000]  Number one, any kind of a demonstration that gets national attention like this is going to attract the real idiot friends, guys that like to march around like they're in the stormtroopers, because they know that the cameras will be there.
[3:48:31.000 --> 3:48:45.000]  There's sort of a symbiotic relationship between these, you know, the neo-Nazi nutcases and the mainstream media, because the mainstream media would like to portray all conservatives, people interested in the Second Amendment.
[3:48:45.000 --> 3:48:48.000]  They would like to portray all of us as neo-Nazis.
[3:48:48.000 --> 3:49:06.000]  So if there are 10 guys at Richmond that look like Charlottesville neo-Nazis in their khaki with swastikas, trust me, that will be the image for everybody of the gun rights movement.
[3:49:06.000 --> 3:49:13.000]  That will be the image. It won't be helped. You can't say, but we didn't invite those guys. We don't like them. We don't want them.
[3:49:13.000 --> 3:49:20.000]  The cameras will be there. Those knuckleheads will be there, and you'll be standing behind them looking like an extra.
[3:49:20.000 --> 3:49:28.000]  So if anybody pulls out that kind of a flag, they need to be yanked down. They need to be thrown in the street.
[3:49:28.000 --> 3:49:34.000]  You don't expect the police to help you. The police are there to make you look bad.
[3:49:34.000 --> 3:49:37.000]  Remember, the police work for Governor Northam.
[3:49:37.000 --> 3:49:45.000]  Governor Northam's house is the executive mansion of Virginia. It's right on the grounds next to the Capitol.
[3:49:45.000 --> 3:49:53.000]  So when you talk about storming the Capitol Square in Richmond, you're talking about storming Northam's house.
[3:49:53.000 --> 3:50:02.000]  If you go on his Twitter feed, you can see he's been getting threats, deservedly, all up and down for the last few months.
[3:50:02.000 --> 3:50:10.000]  If he posts happy birthday or Merry Christmas, he gets angry, threatening tweets as a storm at him.
[3:50:10.000 --> 3:50:15.000]  So he's going to be very freaked out. That means the police are going to be very freaked out.
[3:50:15.000 --> 3:50:24.000]  Something most people don't know. The FBI, the federal building, which is the FBI, the ATF, it's like three blocks from the Capitol.
[3:50:24.000 --> 3:50:33.000]  So they can walk there, the FBI and ATF. The new SAC for Virginia, the Special Agent in Charge, the top FBI guy,
[3:50:33.000 --> 3:50:41.000]  is a guy named David Archie, spelled not like the comic book, but A-R-C-H-E-Y, if you want to look it up.
[3:50:41.000 --> 3:50:49.000]  His last job was being the lead investigator for Mueller. He's an FBI counterintelligence specialist,
[3:50:49.000 --> 3:50:54.000]  probably a buddy of Peter Strock. They got the same bio, same rank, same age.
[3:50:54.000 --> 3:51:03.000]  So Christopher Ray, just since the Mueller thing broke up, put this guy, David Archie, in charge of Richmond.
[3:51:03.000 --> 3:51:11.000]  What have the deep state globalist feds been trying to do for the last, you know, five, ten years?
[3:51:11.000 --> 3:51:19.000]  They have been trying to portray white nationalist patriots as the big domestic terror threat.
[3:51:19.000 --> 3:51:28.000]  They have been trying to dial that up. Now, why is that? It's because if you're a globalist, you do not want to emphasize,
[3:51:28.000 --> 3:51:37.000]  for example, Islamic terrorism, because if the biggest threat is seen as Islamic terrorism, then what's the answer?
[3:51:37.000 --> 3:51:44.000]  More national sovereignty. Close our borders. Defend our country. Don't bring in these refugees from these countries.
[3:51:44.000 --> 3:51:52.000]  But how do you go the other way? How do you get rid of the borders and tend towards globalism?
[3:51:52.000 --> 3:51:57.000]  Well, you make American patriots into the big domestic terror threat.
[3:51:57.000 --> 3:52:06.000]  That's why the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, it's less under Trump, but let's face it, the deep state is still fully embedded.
[3:52:06.000 --> 3:52:19.000]  They're trying to gear up a fear of the white domestic terrorist, having 10 or 20 or 30,000 Americans stampede into Richmond.
[3:52:19.000 --> 3:52:31.000]  For example, waving the stars and bars and pulling out long guns would be a dream for these deep staters within our government.
[3:52:31.000 --> 3:52:39.000]  It is what they stay up at night dreaming about. It is what I would call Charlottesville times 10.
[3:52:39.000 --> 3:52:47.000]  If this happens, it will not advance the cause of our right to keep and bear arms and defending the Second Amendment.
[3:52:47.000 --> 3:52:57.000]  It will convince millions of Americans that gun owners, and remember, only like a third, less than a half of their population are gun owners.
[3:52:57.000 --> 3:53:04.000]  So the people that don't own guns, what would they learn out of a Charlottesville disaster happening in Richmond?
[3:53:04.000 --> 3:53:13.000]  They would learn that American gun owners are dangerous fanatics bordering on domestic terrorists,
[3:53:13.000 --> 3:53:21.000]  and intelligent wise people should do everything we can to ban these dangerous semi-automatic weapons.
[3:53:21.000 --> 3:53:33.000]  Look, I'm on the side of the Second Amendment, but I just think a stampede into Richmond is what the deep state wants to happen.
[3:53:33.000 --> 3:53:41.000]  They would love it if trouble breaks out. Remember in Charlottesville, they actually kept changing the permits,
[3:53:41.000 --> 3:53:49.000]  changing the allowed times and areas so that they could force the Robert E. Lee Statue defenders straight into the path of Antifa.
[3:53:49.000 --> 3:53:56.000]  Then there's no police. They wanted those brawls to break out. They wanted it to happen.
[3:53:56.000 --> 3:54:04.000]  Another example that I would like to reference, which is not Charlottesville, but it shows a kind of a dynamic that can happen.
[3:54:04.000 --> 3:54:12.000]  It could happen in Richmond. This happened a few years ago in Waco, Texas at a restaurant called Twin Peets,
[3:54:12.000 --> 3:54:21.000]  where a couple of motorcycle groups, they were actually having a peaceful meeting, two motorcycle clubs.
[3:54:21.000 --> 3:54:27.000]  They weren't there for a war. They were there to hash things out and have a political peace treaty talk.
[3:54:27.000 --> 3:54:37.000]  Well, because they were to the police, these were dangerous bikers, undercover Waco SWAT was on the parking lot,
[3:54:37.000 --> 3:54:45.000]  in vehicles also around the place on buildings. It's still debatable what happened. Who pulled out a gun first?
[3:54:45.000 --> 3:54:51.000]  It may have been an undercover cop in a bathroom that got outed and he's being pushed around, hits the panic button.
[3:54:51.000 --> 3:55:00.000]  As he's coming out of the restaurant, the SWAT snipers see their undercover getting what they consider in danger.
[3:55:00.000 --> 3:55:09.000]  Bang, bang. The next thing you know, nine bikers are dead. Twenty are grievously wounded. Many of the dead have head wounds.
[3:55:09.000 --> 3:55:14.000]  They arrested 177 bikers. If you were there, you were arrested.
[3:55:14.000 --> 3:55:22.000]  Identical charges of conspiracy to commit aggravated assault, leading to murder, something like that.
[3:55:22.000 --> 3:55:30.000]  Million dollar bail. They spent weeks and weeks in jail. Eventually, all the charges were dropped.
[3:55:30.000 --> 3:55:37.000]  A lot of people think that the bikers were just shot by police snipers. It wasn't a biker versus a biker pistol fight.
[3:55:37.000 --> 3:55:45.000]  When the shooting started out, yeah, there's some bikers seen with pistols. Not one person had a biker bullet pulled out of them.
[3:55:45.000 --> 3:55:51.000]  Most of the dead and wounded, the bullets went right through. A lot of people think it was all police SWAT snipers.
[3:55:51.000 --> 3:56:01.000]  What's that have to do with Richmond? You know, with potentially up to 30,000 or more people pissed off gun owners saying,
[3:56:01.000 --> 3:56:11.000]  I'm going to Richmond to shout in the face of the governor. You know, if you look at that downtown picture around the Capitol,
[3:56:11.000 --> 3:56:21.000]  it's surrounded by, you know, 10 and 8, 10, 12 story buildings. And those are going to just be occupied by police snipers, folks.
[3:56:21.000 --> 3:56:32.000]  I can just see a situation where some troll waving a Nazi flag gets beat up or an antifa with a club confronts some old boomer who pulls out a pistol.
[3:56:32.000 --> 3:56:40.000]  The next thing you know, some trigger happy cop on a building sees somebody pulling a pistol and shoots him.
[3:56:40.000 --> 3:56:47.000]  I mean, look at Charlottesville. One person died just from a car getting surrounded by people. He gunned the accelerator.
[3:56:47.000 --> 3:56:54.000]  You know, it's debatable how it all happened. That person is in prison for life plus 419 years.
[3:56:54.000 --> 3:57:03.000]  This is serious business people. And remember, the deep state globalists want Richmond to be a fiasco.
[3:57:03.000 --> 3:57:11.000]  They want it to be, you know, dynamite stick blowing up in our hand because then they're going to turn around and say,
[3:57:11.000 --> 3:57:19.000]  look at these dangerous gun owners. We need to get these domestic terrorists under control. Please, folks, be smart.
[3:57:19.000 --> 3:57:30.000]  If you go to Richmond, be smart. Read my two essays of Virginia 2020 showdown and the mother of all buffalo jumps.
[3:57:30.000 --> 3:57:37.000]  And when you go to Richmond, please be smart about it. And God willing, in the creek that rise, I'll see you next week.
