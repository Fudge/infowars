[00:00.000 --> 00:13.720]  Big Brother, mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex
[00:13.720 --> 00:33.320]  Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:33.320 --> 00:39.520]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are live. Thank you so much for joining us today. We're
[00:39.520 --> 00:49.080]  going to be here for the next four hours, and we have a guest who was instrumental in getting
[00:49.080 --> 00:55.360]  one of the first resolutions passed back in the early 1990s declaring state sovereignty.
[00:55.360 --> 01:01.920]  He's an American Indian. His name is J.T. Coyote. That's right. That is his nickname,
[01:01.920 --> 01:07.520]  ladies and gentlemen. He'll be joining us coming up in about two hours. We'll also have open phones
[01:07.520 --> 01:14.520]  today, and we're going to go over a ton of important news and information, and then I'm going to be
[01:14.520 --> 01:22.880]  on coast-to-coast AM for three hours this evening with several state representatives joining us
[01:22.880 --> 01:29.320]  from around the country dealing with the state sovereignty issue. So we'll be going over that.
[01:29.320 --> 01:36.840]  This is a big part of the solution the state's declaring sovereignty. Speaking of that, look at
[01:36.840 --> 01:44.040]  this headline. Montana House Measure Would Change Gun Rules. This is from the Montana News Channel.
[01:44.040 --> 01:49.800]  Firearms manufactured and used in Montana would become exempt from federal regulations under
[01:49.800 --> 01:56.120]  a bill being considered in the Montana House. The state House voted in favor of House Bill 246
[01:56.120 --> 02:01.840]  in a second reading on Saturday, and the bill could have the effect of releasing Montana gun owners
[02:01.840 --> 02:10.040]  from federal registration requirements. And that's what the instant check really is, is registration.
[02:10.040 --> 02:16.040]  The gun dealers don't want you to know that. The measures applies to firearms, firearms, accessories,
[02:16.040 --> 02:21.840]  and ammunition that are made and sold in the state. The bill's sponsor says his proposal is more about
[02:21.840 --> 02:29.040]  states' rights than about gun rights. Well, it all ties together. So another example of the state's
[02:29.040 --> 02:39.040]  saying no, no, no. The state's can also be tools of the feds, and by extension, tools of the globalist.
[02:47.040 --> 02:53.040]  Because many states are not declaring sovereignty or defending the republic, they are actually selling out
[02:53.040 --> 02:59.040]  through manualization to the United Nations and other international organizations, private corporations.
[02:59.040 --> 03:07.040]  They are helping the feds bring in tyranny and are willing accomplices aiding and abetting this high treason.
[03:07.040 --> 03:15.040]  So we'll go over that report as well. Also some new developments with the 9-11 truther that was killed aboard
[03:15.040 --> 03:21.040]  the plane that crashed last Thursday night in Buffalo. The aircraft had been out of autopilot,
[03:21.040 --> 03:27.040]  but then switched back into autopilot, and they have a lot of different onboard systems now in many aircraft
[03:27.040 --> 03:35.040]  where the government itself can dial in and take control of the aircraft. That's on record for the autopilot.
[03:35.040 --> 03:41.040]  So very, very suspicious. They would not be coming in for a landing. They switch out of autopilot
[03:41.040 --> 03:52.040]  generally about 100 miles out from their destination, because 100 miles is only about 20 minutes on average,
[03:52.040 --> 04:03.040]  15 minutes flying in, depending on the headwinds or tailwinds. Dallas is 170 miles away from Austin, Texas,
[04:03.040 --> 04:12.040]  and you fly up there in 25 minutes to give you an example from Austin, Texas. Houston's 170 miles as well,
[04:12.040 --> 04:19.040]  and it takes about 25 minutes. But 10 miles out autopilot was engaged, and the plane went down to the ground.
[04:19.040 --> 04:24.040]  So we'll get into that as well. Some of the other news I'm going to cover.
[04:24.040 --> 04:35.040]  Federal obligations exceed world gross domestic product. Does $6.5 trillion terrify anyone yet? $65.5 trillion?
[04:35.040 --> 04:43.040]  That's only what's due today. Not the true obligations. We're talking over $1,000 trillion conservatively,
[04:43.040 --> 04:50.040]  all created by fiat. They will bankrupt the world, the international bankers, and then claim we all owe this fiat money to them.
[04:50.040 --> 05:00.040]  Nice work if you can get it. That's just some of what's coming up after this quick break. Jam-packed transmissions, stay with us.
[05:21.040 --> 05:27.040]  In an event of social unrest and food shortages here in the U.S., grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.

[06:01.040 --> 06:10.040]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Grand Sierra and we knew what to do. Or at least we thought we did.
[06:10.040 --> 06:17.040]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[06:17.040 --> 06:26.040]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[06:26.040 --> 06:33.040]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[06:33.040 --> 06:42.040]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting the countdown. He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

[07:00.040 --> 07:11.040]  With food prices soaring to all time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?

[08:12.040 --> 08:22.040]  And so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[08:42.040 --> 08:56.040]  We are going to open the phones up in this first hour and in the second hour as well as the third and the fourth today when we have one guest joining us continuing our ongoing series dealing with the states rebelling against the criminal activities of the federal government,
[08:56.040 --> 09:06.040]  which is no longer a federal government. It is completely a privately owned subsidiary now of offshore criminal banks.
[09:06.040 --> 09:17.040]  So that is coming up with one of the people that was first involved setting the bushfires in the minds of men and women back in the early 1990s and was the legislative aide.
[09:17.040 --> 09:26.040]  And we did check into this and confirm that that was the case. He called in last week as a caller. It's also one of the moderators on the prisonplanet.com forum.
[09:26.040 --> 09:36.040]  And indeed it was Colorado first in 94 that passed a law declaring states' rights against the feds and that's still on the books.
[09:36.040 --> 09:50.040]  And so we wanted to get him on to go back to the roots of the current upswing in Tenth Amendment Declaration of Liberties or what you could call the second peaceful American Revolution.
[09:50.040 --> 09:56.040]  At least we're attempting that right now.
[09:56.040 --> 10:04.040]  All right, let's go ahead and get into the news that I have here. Federal obligations exceed world GDP.
[10:04.040 --> 10:12.040]  Does 65.5 trillion terrify anyone yet? By Dr. Jerome Corsi, as the Obama administration pushes through Congress,
[10:12.040 --> 10:22.040]  it's $800 billion deficit spending economic stimulus plan. The American public is largely unaware that the true deficit of the federal government already is measured in trillions of dollars.
[10:22.040 --> 10:30.040]  And in fact, the 65.5 trillion in total obligations exceeds the gross domestic product of the world.
[10:30.040 --> 10:42.040]  The entire United States GDP is like 13 trillion a year and the private offshore banks have already stolen, according to Bloomberg. Now 9.7 trillion is now the amount of the bailout.
[10:42.040 --> 10:46.040]  We finally got some new numbers.
[10:46.040 --> 10:50.040]  Meanwhile, what are governments up to?
[10:50.040 --> 10:57.040]  This is out of the New York Post. The governor's high pay Chrissy.
[10:57.040 --> 11:01.040]  Staffers get secret raises amid freeze.
[11:01.040 --> 11:06.040]  Yeah, that's like Obama saying, I'm really against the bailout we've had and it's really terrible.
[11:06.040 --> 11:13.040]  The banker bailout and they've just stolen some of the money and we're going to put caps on their salaries.
[11:13.040 --> 11:22.040]  Of course, all the big companies are exempt and if future companies take any money, it's an honor system and there's no enforcement clause.
[11:22.040 --> 11:34.040]  Meanwhile, all over the country, you notice they're raising hundreds and hundreds of new taxes in some states like 84 new taxes in New York State alone, but hundreds nationwide and growing.
[11:34.040 --> 11:38.040]  No one has an accurate number. We just know it's in the hundreds and growing.
[11:38.040 --> 11:43.040]  And suddenly you just see police everywhere. Everywhere I go, I just see police.
[11:43.040 --> 11:55.040]  I've been in other states as of late and you just see police literally every half mile, every two miles, writing tickets out there, squeezing the public for more and more money that doesn't exist.
[11:55.040 --> 11:58.040]  And is government going to shrink its size? No, they're going to expand.
[11:58.040 --> 12:03.040]  Oh, you don't have the money. Well, how about a jackboot stompy in the face then?
[12:03.040 --> 12:10.040]  Albany governor Patterson has secretly granted raises of as much as 46%.
[12:10.040 --> 12:17.040]  Oh, boy, most Americans have lost their jobs or gotten big pay cuts, but not if you're in government.
[12:17.040 --> 12:30.040]  46% pay raise to more than a dozen staffers at a time when he has asked 130,000 state workers to give up 3% pay hikes because of the state's fiscal crisis.
[12:30.040 --> 12:45.040]  The post has learned the startling pay hikes costing about $250,000 annually were granted after the governor's emergency declaration in August of a looming fiscal crisis that required the state to cut spending and impose a hard hiring freeze.
[12:45.040 --> 12:53.040]  Now, the media will report on these little corruptions, but this is nothing compared to again what the private offshore banks are doing, bringing the nation into receivership.
[12:53.040 --> 13:02.040]  Here's another one out of New York. Adult download tax proposal awaits climax in Albany.
[13:02.040 --> 13:13.040]  Now, they have other bills in their right now to tax Internet downloads, movie downloads, video game downloads, so everything, but they know how to propose it to the public.
[13:13.040 --> 13:18.040]  Whereas the bills say they're going to tax everything online, shopping carts, you name it.
[13:18.040 --> 13:26.040]  And we have previous articles admitting that they're selling it to the public to stop porn.
[13:26.040 --> 13:39.040]  You know, that evil porn, it's a vice. So let us build the bureaucracy to tax everything. In fact, the bills actually do tax much of the Internet and most of the sales and things that go on there.
[13:39.040 --> 13:54.040]  It's just that they're going to advertise that it's porn. People like, well, go ahead and tax porn. And then that brings in the grid to track everything that's going on in the web all over the country and the world through New York as other states adopt and force registration,
[13:54.040 --> 13:58.040]  tracking, taxation, total control.
[13:58.040 --> 14:16.040]  By the way, the New York Times has come out today. It's up on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com and has an, in fact, guys, I thought that was in my stack. Well, you guys go to infowars.com for me in the top stories up there and get me the one with the New York Times calls for Internet to
[14:16.040 --> 14:19.040]  I noticed it wasn't my stack. Thank you.
[14:19.040 --> 14:30.040]  I got hit print this morning, but it didn't print adult download tax proposal awaits climax in Albany. Oh, and there's a little little pun there about climaxing.
[14:30.040 --> 14:39.040]  This is the best tax you ever had a state proposal to add a 4% tax for downloading movies and music will also apply to Internet porn.
[14:39.040 --> 14:49.040]  See, they admit the first line. Oh, this is actually all music and movies and this creates the taxing grid. Now they'll sick the tax police on you.
[14:49.040 --> 14:55.040]  If you're caught downloading any movies, even if somebody wants to give them to you for free, doesn't matter. It's got to be taxed.
[14:55.040 --> 15:06.040]  Governor Patterson recently suggested the so-called iPod tax to help close a $15 million budget deficit, but few realize the levy would also apply to triple X rate of material.
[15:06.040 --> 15:10.040]  The skin industry denounce the move as a cheap political stunt.
[15:10.040 --> 15:20.040]  The last thing any of us need is an additional tax at Stephen Hirsch, CEO of vivid entertainment group, a self-proclaimed king of porn.
[15:20.040 --> 15:25.040]  These are very difficult times and nobody can afford to lose even one customer.
[15:25.040 --> 15:30.040]  The new tax technically isn't a syntax since it applies to all digitally delivered entertainment services.
[15:30.040 --> 15:43.040]  See, they've got the phony churches on the government payroll out all over the country. There's a bunch of states trying to pass this and the feds have written the laws and different international bodies standardized things and then they have them pass it.
[15:43.040 --> 15:49.040]  Europe's trying the same thing and they advertise what you're not for porn, are you? But it's a tax on everything.
[15:49.040 --> 15:59.040]  And even if it was just a tax on porn, which it isn't, it sets up the bureaucracy, the grid and sets the precedent.
[15:59.040 --> 16:07.040]  It would also apply to businesses located in New York state, leaving some to wonder if companies would relocate to avoid the tax. It always starts like that.
[16:07.040 --> 16:14.040]  But take Apple computers. They have different states have a sales tax on that.
[16:14.040 --> 16:21.040]  But you buy it out of state, they still charge you the sales tax and collect it for the government and give it to them, to the particular government.
[16:21.040 --> 16:25.040]  And there's no law, they just do it. See, this is how the bureaucracy operates.
[16:25.040 --> 16:36.040]  When the tourists come, they come to us to buy things. We want to bring people here. We will make money, which is good for everyone, the manager said.
[16:36.040 --> 16:44.040]  A cashier at World of DVD and Times Square and Business has said business has been falling during the past year. Customers already say they have no money.
[16:44.040 --> 16:50.040]  Well, it doesn't matter. Government can't stop. It only grows. It doesn't have a business cycle.
[16:50.040 --> 16:56.040]  It just grows and grows and grows and takes the majority of the money and offshores it to its bank or masters and owners.
[16:56.040 --> 17:03.040]  Here's another one. If you look at the Oregon bills, they have a whole gaggle of them that they've introduced.
[17:03.040 --> 17:11.040]  But the one that's getting the attention is a beer tax. A lot of people don't drink beer, so they say, I'm for it.
[17:11.040 --> 17:18.040]  And they'll always threaten you with another tax. They go, well, we're going to have an expansion of sales tax.
[17:18.040 --> 17:22.040]  Or we're going to have an expansion of property tax if you don't do this.
[17:22.040 --> 17:31.040]  So you better go along with this tax than the next year they pass the tax they threatened you with the last one with.
[17:31.040 --> 17:37.040]  Proposed 1,900% beer tax height. This is from KGWTV.
[17:37.040 --> 17:42.040]  Lawmakers say tax will help budget brewers worn of lost jobs.
[17:42.040 --> 17:50.040]  Five Oregon state lawmakers once imposed a hefty tax on beer and have introduced a bill that brewers say would cripple them.
[17:50.040 --> 18:05.040]  Four Portland legislators joined a Springfield senator to introduce Oregon House Bill 2461, which would impose a $49.61 tax on each barrel of beer produced by Oregon brewers.
[18:05.040 --> 18:13.040]  And then a bunch of idiots have seen them saying, well, so what? I don't buy barrels. I don't buy kegs. No, no, that's the unit measurement used in taxation.
[18:13.040 --> 18:21.040]  You will pay per bottle, dimwit. The tax would raise revenue for the state at a time when budgets are running in the red.
[18:21.040 --> 18:30.040]  Specifically, the bill says it would fund prevention, treatment and recovery programs for those addicted to alcohol and other substances.
[18:30.040 --> 18:40.040]  Yeah, like they said, they were going to have lottery in all the major states to fund education funds and it ends up the mobs running it and they don't give the money to education.
[18:40.040 --> 18:44.040]  And all it does is a tax on the ignorant and the poor.
[18:44.040 --> 18:55.040]  So many times I try to go on a gas station to pay for gas or buy some cookies or something and there's all these people lined up just desperately on Friday after they get their paychecks just buying lottery.
[18:55.040 --> 19:00.040]  I got to make it big. I got to get a million dollars.
[19:00.040 --> 19:05.040]  It's this get rich quick. It's this delusional magical thinking.
[19:05.040 --> 19:10.040]  Same thing that people think Barack Obama is going to save them or George Bush was going to save them.
[19:10.040 --> 19:16.040]  It's delusion. You're always waiting for the next thing to get suckered on.
[19:16.040 --> 19:20.040]  The tax would raise revenue for the state at a time when budgets are running in the red.
[19:20.040 --> 19:25.040]  Specifically, the bill says it would fund prevention, treatment and recovery.
[19:25.040 --> 19:33.040]  It also defends the tax by claiming alcoholism and untreated substance abuse cost the state $4.15 billion in lost earnings as well as more than $8 million in health care.
[19:33.040 --> 19:38.040]  See, that's the socialism. Oh, people drinking cost a lot of money to taxpayers.
[19:38.040 --> 19:41.040]  What about the illegal aliens? They dwarf all that combined.
[19:41.040 --> 19:44.040]  Oh, don't talk about that and their costs.
[19:44.040 --> 19:52.040]  You know, burrs say it isn't the low tax that makes Oregon such an alternative business climate for crafting beers.
[19:52.040 --> 19:55.040]  They say it is the low tax. Alright, we'll be right back.
[19:55.040 --> 20:00.040]  Well, government's got to kill every industry and that's what they do. They've got to control everything.
[20:00.040 --> 20:03.040]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[20:03.040 --> 20:08.040]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[20:08.040 --> 20:18.040]  But the symptoms are there. Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[20:18.040 --> 20:24.040]  Here, how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[20:24.040 --> 20:28.040]  My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.
[20:28.040 --> 20:32.040]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[20:32.040 --> 20:34.040]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[20:34.040 --> 20:42.040]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[21:00.040 --> 21:08.040]  Good day. Jim Newcomer from ITUS Resources. February 16, 2009. The overseas gold market is at $943.
[21:08.040 --> 21:15.040]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $9702, $485.01 for the half ounce and $242.51 for a quarter ounce.
[21:15.040 --> 21:20.040]  That's $9702, $485.01 and $242.51.
[21:20.040 --> 21:25.040]  We all want liberty. Some give their lives for it. A price that cannot be taken for granted.
[21:25.040 --> 21:33.040]  Bites and pieces of our freedom for what? February 28, Minnesota Campaign for Liberty will host Tom Woods, best-selling author of The Meltdown,
[21:33.040 --> 21:39.040]  Professor Butler, author of Trade on the Great Depression, and Bill Butler to cover monetary policy.
[21:39.040 --> 21:43.040]  This workshop will empower you to be effective at meetings and conversations.
[21:43.040 --> 21:48.040]  With advanced discounts, the cost is $20, a small price for liberty.

[22:19.040 --> 22:30.040]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[22:30.040 --> 22:53.040]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[23:00.040 --> 23:05.040]  The headlines are clear. The worldwide economic collapse is here.
[23:05.040 --> 23:10.040]  The military is being positioned for martial law. The mark of the beast is at hand.
[23:10.040 --> 23:13.040]  Governments are calling for a new world cashless economic system.
[23:13.040 --> 23:18.040]  Having a long-term food solution is your only hope. To stay free.
[23:18.040 --> 23:25.040]  Now, Survival of Seeds introduces their Escape the Beast Kit. 24 varieties of all-natural, non-genetically modified heirloom seeds.
[23:25.040 --> 23:32.040]  For true patriots and homesteaders wanting food insurance, that's over 5 pounds of rare historic seeds for a penny per seed.
[23:32.040 --> 23:36.040]  15,000 seeds that will feed a family healthy food for 7 years.

[23:42.040 --> 23:47.040]  Selling the produce from his incredible heirloom seeds back to him, restaurants and small delis.

[23:52.040 --> 23:56.040]  Survivalist Seeds dot com. That's Survivalist Seeds dot com.
[23:56.040 --> 24:25.040]  A long-term food solution.
[24:26.040 --> 24:39.040]  We are back live.
[24:39.040 --> 24:49.040]  Coming up in the next hour, I'm going to play the audio from a couple of YouTube clips where people are criticizing myself and others.
[24:49.040 --> 24:54.040]  One guy says that I'm making up spider-goats.
[24:54.040 --> 24:56.040]  This has happened hundreds of times.
[24:56.040 --> 25:01.040]  I get up here and I talk about cross-species genetically modified organisms.
[25:01.040 --> 25:06.040]  Part pig, part human, part monkey, part human, part ape, part human.
[25:06.040 --> 25:11.040]  Part goat, part spider for body armor. That's been in the news for now 10 years.
[25:11.040 --> 25:19.040]  That's why people think I'm a liar because they're uninformed and they really believe I'm lying about this on air.
[25:19.040 --> 25:25.040]  So I thought I'd pull up some news articles, read those on air for people and then, you know, just play a clip.
[25:25.040 --> 25:39.040]  Another guy is basically rebuking myself, Mark Dice and others, saying that we never talk about the Bible or the Luciferian elements of the New World Order.
[25:39.040 --> 25:41.040]  That's not true.
[25:41.040 --> 25:53.040]  But I'm not playing this because I'm being criticized. I'm playing this because I see this type of mindset over and over again with people when they approach knowledge.
[25:53.040 --> 25:58.040]  So that is coming up. Your phone calls are also coming up in the next segment.
[25:58.040 --> 26:07.040]  Okay, so I just got into how all over the country different states are erecting or trying to pass hundreds of new taxes.
[26:07.040 --> 26:16.040]  And they're on the few industries left. And they will come out with taxes on production and say it's for porn or say it's for beer.
[26:16.040 --> 26:26.040]  But then when you read between the lines and the fine print, you find out that it's taxes across the board.
[26:26.040 --> 26:33.040]  In fact, in the last few days, I've seen five different Obama administration officials, cabinet members,
[26:33.040 --> 26:41.040]  and some U.S. senators come out and say we've got to have a carbon tax for the government shortfall.
[26:41.040 --> 26:53.040]  And then they admit they're going to tax your cars, your houses, your air conditioners, your water, cows, sheep, pigs.
[26:53.040 --> 27:03.040]  They want a stake tax, so they're going to tax the farmer, the rancher, but then they're going to tax you when you eat hamburger, when you eat steak, when you eat any meat.
[27:03.040 --> 27:08.040]  I mean, folks, this carbon tax business is hundreds and hundreds of taxes.
[27:08.040 --> 27:11.040]  So we're going to go over that as well.
[27:11.040 --> 27:22.040]  But speaking of Internet too, in the last six years, Paul Watson and Steve Watson in my direction have done deep research on Internet too.
[27:22.040 --> 27:27.040]  And written detailed articles, some of which have gotten national attention.
[27:27.040 --> 27:35.040]  And people still have trouble believing our claims, even when we link to the government announcements, to the university announcements,
[27:35.040 --> 27:47.040]  and to the consortium of European and Anglo-American governments, the U.S., Canada, England, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, France.
[27:47.040 --> 27:54.040]  And they have Internet too, consortium meetings every month, but they have big ones, big conventions, once a year.
[27:54.040 --> 28:04.040]  And they always announce at the beginning, it's their catchphrase, the Internet is dead, and then they all hooray and cheer.
[28:04.040 --> 28:11.040]  And for at least seven years, we learned about it about five, six years ago, they met right here in Austin three years ago,
[28:11.040 --> 28:20.040]  they are building the new Internet, and they're allowing the old Internet to be shut down and fail, and they're preparing to force everyone onto it.
[28:20.040 --> 28:23.040]  Within two years is what they say.
[28:23.040 --> 28:33.040]  And now the net neutrality is being blocked, net taxation is beginning, net registration is beginning, federal and international courts are ruling,
[28:33.040 --> 28:45.040]  there's no anonymity when you're surfing, and so it's an entire cocktail or group of programs that will incrementally kill the Internet as we know it.
[28:45.040 --> 28:54.040]  Now this is violently unpopular, the people are extremely upset worldwide by this when they learn of just pieces of it,
[28:54.040 --> 29:02.040]  but because it's to be phased in incrementally, the plan is going to succeed right now unless people get the big picture.
[29:02.040 --> 29:09.040]  I mean even quote, anti-net neutrality or I mean groups that are for net neutrality, they're anti-non-net neutrality,
[29:09.040 --> 29:15.040]  even the quote consortiums that study this and quote, fight against it, don't seem to get the big picture.
[29:15.040 --> 29:20.040]  And when I do videos about it and break it down, people are still in denial.
[29:20.040 --> 29:28.040]  This is the New York Times today,
[29:28.040 --> 29:36.040]  and it says New York Times calls for Internet too, we're going to go over this report after the break and then get to your phone calls.
[29:36.040 --> 29:43.040]  But they are shutting down the web, they basically have to or we're going to kick their hind ins.
[29:43.040 --> 29:50.040]  They've tried to counter our information war with lives and it doesn't work in the info war.
[29:50.040 --> 29:54.040]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[29:54.040 --> 30:00.040]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:25.040 --> 30:32.040]  And a five stage carbon and UV light filtration system which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[30:32.040 --> 30:36.040]  Finally, drinking water that you control, I use one every day.
[30:36.040 --> 30:42.040]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services and storing five gallon bottles of water in your home.
[30:42.040 --> 30:48.040]  The Acola Blue 28 is shipped right to your home, ready to make close to seven gallons a day right out of the box.

[31:25.040 --> 31:28.040]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[31:28.040 --> 31:32.040]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases to bombs in the buildings,
[31:32.040 --> 31:36.040]  Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[31:51.040 --> 31:54.040]  We're in a no-holds-far information war.
[31:54.040 --> 32:00.040]  Truth is our weapon, and prisonplanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.

[32:54.040 --> 33:12.040]  www.e-foodsdirect.com
[33:25.040 --> 33:28.040]  Living on the road, my friend
[33:28.040 --> 33:32.040]  Was gonna keep you free and clean
[33:32.040 --> 33:36.040]  And now you wear your skin like a heart
[33:36.040 --> 33:40.040]  And your breath as hard as kerosene
[33:40.040 --> 33:44.040]  Weren't your mama's only boy
[33:44.040 --> 33:48.040]  What her favorite wanted seemed
[33:48.040 --> 33:52.040]  She began to cry when you said
[33:52.040 --> 33:56.040]  Goodbye
[33:56.040 --> 34:02.040]  Sack into your dream
[34:02.040 --> 34:06.040]  Pancho was a bandit boy
[34:06.040 --> 34:10.040]  His horse was fast as far as steel
[34:10.040 --> 34:14.040]  He wore his gun outside his pants
[34:14.040 --> 34:18.040]  For all the honest world field
[34:18.040 --> 34:22.040]  But you met his match, you know
[34:22.040 --> 34:26.040]  On the deserts down in Mexico
[34:26.040 --> 34:30.040]  Nobody heard his dying words
[34:30.040 --> 34:34.040]  But that's the way it goes
[34:34.040 --> 34:38.040]  But that's the way it goes
[34:38.040 --> 34:42.040]  All the better all they say
[34:42.040 --> 34:46.040]  They could have had him any day
[34:46.040 --> 34:50.040]  They only let him slip away
[34:50.040 --> 34:52.040]  Out of kindness, I suppose
[34:52.040 --> 34:56.040]  Out of kindness, I suppose
[34:58.040 --> 35:02.040]  Lifty, he can't sing the blues
[35:02.040 --> 35:06.040]  All night long like he used to
[35:06.040 --> 35:10.040]  But does the poncho bit down sound
[35:10.040 --> 35:14.040]  Ended up and left his mouth
[35:14.040 --> 35:18.040]  The day they laid poor poncho low
[35:18.040 --> 35:22.040]  Left his foot for Ohio
[35:22.040 --> 35:26.040]  Where he got the bread to go
[35:26.040 --> 35:30.040]  Ain't nobody knows
[35:36.040 --> 35:40.040]  Do we need a new internet? Here it is in the New York Times
[35:40.040 --> 35:43.040]  As they introduce the end of the web to the slaves
[35:43.040 --> 35:47.040]  We only let him slip away
[35:47.040 --> 36:15.040]  Out of kindness, I suppose
[36:17.040 --> 36:25.040]  The boys tell how poncho fell
[36:25.040 --> 36:29.040]  And left his living in a cheap hotel
[36:29.040 --> 36:33.040]  The deserts quiet, Cleveland's cold
[36:33.040 --> 36:37.040]  So the story ends, we're told
[36:37.040 --> 36:41.040]  I don't need your prayers, it's true
[36:41.040 --> 36:45.040]  Save a few people left it to
[36:45.040 --> 36:49.040]  He only did what he had to do
[36:49.040 --> 36:53.040]  And now he's grown old
[36:53.040 --> 36:57.040]  And now he's grown old
[36:57.040 --> 37:01.040]  All the better all they say
[37:01.040 --> 37:05.040]  We could have had him any day
[37:05.040 --> 37:09.040]  We only let him go so far
[37:09.040 --> 37:13.040]  Out of kindness, I suppose
[37:13.040 --> 37:17.040]  They've already built them, already prepared the police and military
[37:17.040 --> 37:19.040]  To go along with it
[37:19.040 --> 37:21.040]  And the secret arrest of the American people
[37:21.040 --> 37:23.040]  In martial law
[37:23.040 --> 37:25.040]  And it's the same thing with killing the internet
[37:25.040 --> 37:28.040]  Now they're announcing internet too
[37:28.040 --> 37:31.040]  That means they're preparing to move ahead with it
[37:31.040 --> 37:33.040]  And they are moving ahead with it, ending that neutrality
[37:33.040 --> 37:36.040]  Taxing the internet, building a new internet
[37:36.040 --> 37:39.040]  Not up keeping the major grids
[37:39.040 --> 37:42.040]  That allowed the real internet to operate
[37:42.040 --> 37:44.040]  Now when they have their meetings every year
[37:44.040 --> 37:46.040]  Internet too, with government and private industry
[37:46.040 --> 37:48.040]  They say, it's wonderful, we're going to build the web
[37:48.040 --> 37:50.040]  Let everybody get on board
[37:50.040 --> 37:52.040]  And then we're just going to shut down the old web
[37:52.040 --> 37:56.040]  And force everyone into a few thousand websites we control
[37:56.040 --> 37:59.040]  Then there won't be an infowars.com
[37:59.040 --> 38:02.040]  Or a prisonplanet.com or a jonesreport.com
[38:02.040 --> 38:04.040]  Or your website
[38:04.040 --> 38:07.040]  You will have a sub-site just like you do on MySpace
[38:07.040 --> 38:10.040]  Or just like you do on Facebook or YouTube
[38:10.040 --> 38:12.040]  And they can delete you, they can censor you
[38:12.040 --> 38:13.040]  They can control you
[38:13.040 --> 38:15.040]  Here's an example
[38:15.040 --> 38:18.040]  We let about 500 people on average
[38:18.040 --> 38:20.040]  Some weeks it's more, some less
[38:20.040 --> 38:23.040]  New members into our MySpace account
[38:23.040 --> 38:26.040]  MySpace 4 slash info warrior
[38:26.040 --> 38:28.040]  Doesn't matter, our number just keeps dropping
[38:28.040 --> 38:30.040]  It was up at 60,000, it's down at 50,000 now
[38:30.040 --> 38:32.040]  It's actually growing
[38:32.040 --> 38:34.040]  They don't care, it's shut down
[38:34.040 --> 38:38.040]  They don't let us send out most of our bulletins
[38:38.040 --> 38:40.040]  So I have a MySpace account
[38:40.040 --> 38:45.040]  But it's becoming basically worthless
[38:45.040 --> 38:47.040]  Many hotels, many government buildings
[38:47.040 --> 38:52.040]  Many university computer systems and libraries
[38:52.040 --> 38:55.040]  Many governments, many countries, many wireless systems
[38:55.040 --> 38:57.040]  That quote governments offer for free
[38:57.040 --> 39:00.040]  You can't go to infowars.com and prisonplanet.com
[39:00.040 --> 39:04.040]  We are on the list of banned websites
[39:04.040 --> 39:07.040]  And don't think that Yahoo and Google and Microsoft
[39:07.040 --> 39:09.040]  Don't know how to do this
[39:09.040 --> 39:15.040]  They already run the censorship for China and other nations
[39:15.040 --> 39:20.040]  They built the architecture for the communist Chinese
[39:20.040 --> 39:22.040]  And so that's what they're setting up here
[39:22.040 --> 39:25.040]  They're now incrementally
[39:25.040 --> 39:27.040]  The analogy of how they're shutting the web down
[39:27.040 --> 39:32.040]  Is like the Hal 9000 in 2001, a space odyssey
[39:32.040 --> 39:34.040]  When the astronaut goes into the control bay
[39:34.040 --> 39:39.040]  And he's turning Hal off one memory cell at a time
[39:39.040 --> 39:44.040]  And he turns one off of the first hundred or so memory cubes
[39:44.040 --> 39:46.040]  And he says, Dave, don't do that
[39:46.040 --> 39:51.040]  Let's talk Dave, no Dave, I'm afraid Dave, I'm afraid
[39:51.040 --> 39:53.040]  They've already turned off about 20 of them
[39:53.040 --> 39:55.040]  They're moving down, the public doesn't know
[39:55.040 --> 39:57.040]  They're shutting the old web off and it's starting to say
[39:57.040 --> 40:05.040]  Dave, you don't need to do that
[40:05.040 --> 40:09.040]  And so they're shutting it down right now
[40:09.040 --> 40:11.040]  Do we need a new internet?
[40:11.040 --> 40:15.040]  Two decades ago, a 23-year-old Cornell University graduate student
[40:15.040 --> 40:18.040]  Brought the internet to its knees with a simple software program
[40:18.040 --> 40:22.040]  That skipped from computer to computer at blinding speed
[40:22.040 --> 40:26.040]  Thoroughly clogging the then tiny network in a space of a few hours
[40:26.040 --> 40:29.040]  The program was intended to be a digital kill-roy
[40:29.040 --> 40:33.040]  Was here, just a bit of cybernetic fungus
[40:33.040 --> 40:35.040]  That would unobtrusively wander the net
[40:35.040 --> 40:38.040]  However, the programmer error turned it into a harbinger
[40:38.040 --> 40:41.040]  Heralding the arrival of a darker cyberspace
[40:41.040 --> 40:43.040]  And it's turned out the government industry
[40:43.040 --> 40:45.040]  Writes most of the big viruses
[40:45.040 --> 40:48.040]  More of a mirror for all of the chaos and conflict
[40:48.040 --> 40:52.040]  Of the physical world than a utopia refuge from it
[40:52.040 --> 40:56.040]  The mainstream media always demonizes the internet
[40:56.040 --> 40:58.040]  And talks about how dangerous and evil and bad it is
[40:58.040 --> 41:02.040]  Since then, things have gotten much, much worse
[41:02.040 --> 41:04.040]  Oh, it's so terrible on the internet
[41:04.040 --> 41:06.040]  The only thing that kept our economy going after
[41:06.040 --> 41:08.040]  What happened in the 90s
[41:08.040 --> 41:11.040]  Bad enough that there is a growing belief among engineers
[41:11.040 --> 41:13.040]  And security experts in internet security
[41:13.040 --> 41:17.040]  And privacy have become so maddeningly elusive
[41:17.040 --> 41:19.040]  That the only way to fix the problem is to start over
[41:19.040 --> 41:22.040]  They're always advertising how the web is dangerous
[41:22.040 --> 41:23.040]  How you get ripped off from the web
[41:23.040 --> 41:24.040]  I've seen the federal statistics
[41:24.040 --> 41:27.040]  Close to 90% of credit card fraud
[41:27.040 --> 41:32.040]  Is people inside banks and institutions and government
[41:32.040 --> 41:34.040]  Selling people's data
[41:34.040 --> 41:36.040]  I mean, they have thefts all the time of a million names
[41:36.040 --> 41:38.040]  And addresses and social security numbers
[41:38.040 --> 41:40.040]  Or Bank of America, 3 million
[41:40.040 --> 41:42.040]  People go inside, it's like a bank robbery
[41:42.040 --> 41:44.040]  They put millions of names on one desk
[41:44.040 --> 41:47.040]  Inside job
[41:47.040 --> 41:49.040]  They then sell it to foreign nations
[41:49.040 --> 41:52.040]  Russia, India, Nigeria
[41:52.040 --> 41:53.040]  They allow people to sit there
[41:53.040 --> 41:56.040]  And legally engage in crime from overseas
[41:56.040 --> 42:00.040]  Then they use the web to carry it out
[42:00.040 --> 42:02.040]  It's like the government's now making all the passports
[42:02.040 --> 42:04.040]  Have RFID, a bunch of different driver's license
[42:04.040 --> 42:06.040]  Have radio frequency identification devices
[42:06.040 --> 42:07.040]  And now it's admitted in the news
[42:07.040 --> 42:10.040]  But never nationally that people are driving around with readers
[42:10.040 --> 42:15.040]  And in minutes in a major city can get hundreds of names
[42:15.040 --> 42:17.040]  And social security numbers
[42:17.040 --> 42:18.040]  And are using that for fraud
[42:18.040 --> 42:19.040]  Does the government care?
[42:19.040 --> 42:21.040]  No, the worse the identity theft gets
[42:21.040 --> 42:22.040]  The more control they'll call for
[42:22.040 --> 42:25.040]  With biometric access to your data
[42:25.040 --> 42:27.040]  Oh, you got a thumb printer face scan now to use your card
[42:27.040 --> 42:33.040]  Because there's so much identity theft
[42:33.040 --> 42:35.040]  What a new internet might look like
[42:35.040 --> 42:36.040]  Is still widely debated
[42:36.040 --> 42:37.040]  That's not really what I've already built it
[42:37.040 --> 42:41.040]  But one alternative would affect create a gated community
[42:41.040 --> 42:43.040]  I want Paul Watson to do, I told you so, article
[42:43.040 --> 42:45.040]  And pull up that four-year-old story he did
[42:45.040 --> 42:51.040]  About MySpace is the Trojan horse of net censorship
[42:51.040 --> 42:53.040]  Listen to this, a gated community
[42:53.040 --> 42:56.040]  Where users would give up their anonymity
[42:56.040 --> 42:58.040]  And certain freedoms in return for safety
[42:58.040 --> 43:00.040]  Oh, safety granted by the government
[43:00.040 --> 43:01.040]  Today that is already the case
[43:01.040 --> 43:03.040]  For many corporate and governmental internet users
[43:03.040 --> 43:06.040]  Yeah, you have the safety to not see infowars.com
[43:06.040 --> 43:08.040]  Keep your mind safe
[43:08.040 --> 43:11.040]  As a new and more secure network becomes widely adopted
[43:11.040 --> 43:13.040]  Remember how they said put all your money in 401ks
[43:13.040 --> 43:15.040]  Because the government would keep it safe
[43:15.040 --> 43:16.040]  And now they're stolen
[43:16.040 --> 43:17.040]  What more than half your value
[43:17.040 --> 43:19.040]  They'll take it all before they're done
[43:19.040 --> 43:22.040]  Oh, they've got something safe for you
[43:22.040 --> 43:24.040]  Where users would give up their anonymity
[43:24.040 --> 43:26.040]  And certain freedoms in return for safety
[43:26.040 --> 43:28.040]  Give up your liberty for security
[43:28.040 --> 43:29.040]  What the founders say about that
[43:29.040 --> 43:31.040]  You'll get neither liberty nor security doing that
[43:31.040 --> 43:33.040]  Today there is already the case
[43:33.040 --> 43:35.040]  For many corporate and governmental internet users
[43:35.040 --> 43:39.040]  As a new and more secure network becomes widely adopted
[43:39.040 --> 43:41.040]  The current internet might end up
[43:41.040 --> 43:43.040]  As the bad neighborhood of cyberspace
[43:45.040 --> 43:47.040]  No, they say that once they get about 30% of people
[43:47.040 --> 43:49.040]  To sign up for internet too
[43:49.040 --> 43:51.040]  They're just going to shut down the old web
[43:51.040 --> 43:52.040]  Remember like five years ago
[43:52.040 --> 43:53.040]  When level three and cogent
[43:53.040 --> 43:55.040]  Just two medium-sized backbone peer-to-peer systems
[43:55.040 --> 43:57.040]  Had a fight with each other
[43:57.040 --> 44:00.040]  And over a third of the web was inaccessible
[44:00.040 --> 44:03.040]  They just punch a few buttons, it's gone, okay?
[44:03.040 --> 44:05.040]  You would enter at your own risk
[44:05.040 --> 44:08.040]  And keep an eye over your shoulder while you were there
[44:08.040 --> 44:09.040]  What does this mean?
[44:09.040 --> 44:11.040]  You would, ooh, keep an eye over your shoulder
[44:11.040 --> 44:12.040]  Oh my goodness
[44:12.040 --> 44:14.040]  Unless we're willing to rethink today's internet
[44:14.040 --> 44:18.040]  Says Nick McCowan, a Stanford engineer
[44:18.040 --> 44:20.040]  Involved in building the new internet
[44:20.040 --> 44:21.040]  Oh, building the new internet
[44:21.040 --> 44:25.040]  We're just waiting for the series of public catastrophes
[44:25.040 --> 44:27.040]  That was driven home late last year
[44:27.040 --> 44:29.040]  When a malicious software program
[44:29.040 --> 44:31.040]  Thought to have been unleashed by a criminal gang
[44:31.040 --> 44:33.040]  In Eastern Europe suddenly appeared
[44:33.040 --> 44:38.040]  After easily sidestepping the world's best cyber defenses
[44:38.040 --> 44:42.040]  Folks, they've built the Microsoft operating system
[44:42.040 --> 44:43.040]  That most of the internet and the web
[44:43.040 --> 44:45.040]  And your computer's based on
[44:45.040 --> 44:47.040]  With government backdoors and all of it
[44:47.040 --> 44:49.040]  And that's what's allowed all this to happen
[44:49.040 --> 44:51.040]  And they know that and brag about it
[44:51.040 --> 44:52.040]  It's very funny
[44:52.040 --> 44:56.040]  Known as ConFicker
[44:56.040 --> 44:59.040]  It quickly infected more than 12 million computers
[44:59.040 --> 45:02.040]  Ravaging everything from computer systems
[45:02.040 --> 45:04.040]  At a surgical ward in England
[45:04.040 --> 45:07.040]  To the computer networks of a French military
[45:07.040 --> 45:08.040]  That's a bunch of bologna
[45:08.040 --> 45:11.040]  The military has their networks off system
[45:11.040 --> 45:13.040]  What some of the stuff the troops used
[45:13.040 --> 45:15.040]  And their barracks got messed up
[45:15.040 --> 45:17.040]  ConFicker remains a ticking time bomb
[45:17.040 --> 45:20.040]  Oh, ooh, ooh
[45:20.040 --> 45:23.040]  It now has the power to lash together
[45:23.040 --> 45:26.040]  Those infected computers into a vast supercomputer
[45:26.040 --> 45:28.040]  Called a bonnet
[45:28.040 --> 45:31.040]  That can be controlled clandestinely by its creators
[45:31.040 --> 45:34.040]  What comes next remains a puzzle
[45:34.040 --> 45:37.040]  That was just the Russians, many experts say
[45:37.040 --> 45:40.040]  Tying into the surveillance net
[45:40.040 --> 45:43.040]  That the NSA and Northcom are using the internet for
[45:43.040 --> 45:44.040]  That they designed
[45:44.040 --> 45:47.040]  Well, you don't think the Chinese and the Russians don't know
[45:47.040 --> 45:51.040]  It's designed to surveil everybody?
[45:51.040 --> 45:54.040]  The worldwide wiretap, as it's called by them
[45:54.040 --> 45:58.040]  ConFicker would be used as the world's most powerful spam engine
[45:58.040 --> 46:00.040]  Perhaps a distributed software program
[46:00.040 --> 46:03.040]  To trick computer users into purchasing fake antivirus protection
[46:03.040 --> 46:05.040]  Oh, no, or much worse
[46:05.040 --> 46:09.040]  It might also be used to shut off entire sections of the internet
[46:09.040 --> 46:12.040]  But whatever happens, ConFicker has demonstrated
[46:12.040 --> 46:16.040]  The internet remains highly vulnerable to a concerted attack
[46:16.040 --> 46:19.040]  And we know the globalists that ran the false flag attack of 9-11
[46:19.040 --> 46:22.040]  And that ran the false implosion of the banking system
[46:22.040 --> 46:23.040]  To bring in their world government
[46:23.040 --> 46:26.040]  We know they're the main culprits
[46:26.040 --> 46:28.040]  Most hackers are actually fighting them
[46:28.040 --> 46:31.040]  You know, hackers are running around attacking and robbing and stealing
[46:31.040 --> 46:34.040]  No, that's the government people and the organized crime
[46:34.040 --> 46:38.040]  Real hackers, I'd say 95% of them are defending free speech
[46:38.040 --> 46:41.040]  All the way to the wall
[46:44.040 --> 46:46.040]  And we salute them
[46:46.040 --> 46:49.040]  If you're looking for a digital Pearl Harbor
[46:49.040 --> 46:52.040]  We now have the Japanese ship steaming towards us
[46:52.040 --> 46:56.040]  On the horizon said Rick Wesson, the chief executive of Support Intelligence
[46:56.040 --> 46:58.040]  A computer consulting firm said recently
[46:58.040 --> 47:00.040]  The internet's original designers never first saw
[47:00.040 --> 47:02.040]  That the academic and military research network
[47:02.040 --> 47:05.040]  They created one one day be the burden of carrying
[47:05.040 --> 47:07.040]  All the world's communications and commerce
[47:07.040 --> 47:09.040]  There was no one central control point
[47:09.040 --> 47:11.040]  And the designers wanted to make it possible
[47:11.040 --> 47:13.040]  For every network to exchange data with every other network
[47:13.040 --> 47:16.040]  Little attention was given to security
[47:16.040 --> 47:19.040]  Since then there have been immense efforts to bolt up security
[47:19.040 --> 47:21.040]  With little effect
[47:21.040 --> 47:22.040]  Total bull
[47:22.040 --> 47:25.040]  It's a wonderful adventure on the internet
[47:25.040 --> 47:28.040]  They'll make it all sterile with a few thousand sites
[47:28.040 --> 47:30.040]  Already Time Warner in Texas
[47:30.040 --> 47:33.040]  Time Warner in Canada
[47:33.040 --> 47:36.040]  It's restricting the sites you can go to to just a few thousand
[47:36.040 --> 47:38.040]  That's on record
[47:38.040 --> 47:41.040]  In many respects we are probably worse off than we were 20 years ago
[47:41.040 --> 47:43.040]  Said Eugene Sappford
[47:43.040 --> 47:47.040]  Oh yes, it's just terrible that we now can surf around and have choices
[47:47.040 --> 47:51.040]  See, they have to do this because the alternative media
[47:51.040 --> 47:54.040]  Is destroying the mainstream propaganda whores
[47:54.040 --> 47:58.040]  They're market shares imploding
[47:58.040 --> 48:00.040]  The people have now had a taste of true diversity
[48:00.040 --> 48:03.040]  The citizen media, citizen reporters are taking over
[48:03.040 --> 48:06.040]  People are doing real reporting for their local town
[48:06.040 --> 48:09.040]  They're even making it profitable, just two or three men or women
[48:09.040 --> 48:11.040]  Will set up local news in their small town
[48:11.040 --> 48:13.040]  People start visiting it
[48:13.040 --> 48:15.040]  People can post on message boards about what happened to them
[48:15.040 --> 48:18.040]  At different businesses, which ones they like, which ones they don't
[48:18.040 --> 48:22.040]  This is a true liberating force greater than Gutenberg's press
[48:22.040 --> 48:25.040]  Moveable type
[48:25.040 --> 48:28.040]  And I'm sorry, you're not going to put the genie back in the bottle
[48:28.040 --> 48:32.040]  That's why we have to race though to totally get into every corner of the web
[48:32.040 --> 48:35.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, and get our information, the freedom of information
[48:35.040 --> 48:40.040]  On every platform and dominate those platforms
[48:40.040 --> 48:43.040]  I mean, good luck keeping my information even out of internet too
[48:43.040 --> 48:46.040]  Good luck
[48:46.040 --> 48:52.040]  In many respects, we're probably worse off than we were 20 years ago
[48:52.040 --> 48:56.040]  Said Eugene Sappford, the executive director of the Center for Education Research
[48:56.040 --> 48:59.040]  And Information Assurance and Security at Purdue University
[48:59.040 --> 49:01.040]  And pioneering internet security researcher
[49:01.040 --> 49:05.040]  Because of all the money that has been devoted to patching the current problem
[49:05.040 --> 49:08.040]  Rather than investing in the redesign of our infrastructure
[49:08.040 --> 49:11.040]  Oh yes, we need to redesign and in their words
[49:11.040 --> 49:14.040]  Have a gated community where you give up your freedoms
[49:14.040 --> 49:18.040]  That's a quote, oh yes
[49:18.040 --> 49:22.040]  Because of all the money has been devoted to patching the current problem
[49:22.040 --> 49:24.040]  Rather than investing in the redesign of it
[49:24.040 --> 49:26.040]  That's not true, you're putting it all into the news system
[49:26.040 --> 49:28.040]  And then causing problems
[49:28.040 --> 49:31.040]  In fact, many computer security researchers view
[49:31.040 --> 49:34.040]  Nearly two decades of efforts to patch the existing network
[49:34.040 --> 49:37.040]  As a marginal line approach to defense
[49:37.040 --> 49:39.040]  That's what the French had against the Germans
[49:39.040 --> 49:44.040]  No, the Vichy French that controlled most of the upper echelon of the French military
[49:44.040 --> 49:48.040]  Stood down, that's what happened
[49:48.040 --> 49:51.040]  In fact, many computer security researchers view
[49:51.040 --> 49:53.040]  Nearly two decades of efforts to patch the existing network
[49:53.040 --> 49:55.040]  As a marginal line approach to defense
[49:55.040 --> 49:58.040]  See, that's not true, it's because it is diverse and it's so strong
[49:58.040 --> 50:00.040]  That's why it's resisted all these attacks
[50:00.040 --> 50:02.040]  But they don't tell you that
[50:02.040 --> 50:05.040]  A reference to France's series of fortifications that prevent effective during World War II
[50:05.040 --> 50:08.040]  The shortcoming is focusing on such sturdy digital walls
[50:08.040 --> 50:10.040]  That they once are evaded
[50:10.040 --> 50:14.040]  The attacker has access to all the protected data behind them
[50:14.040 --> 50:19.040]  Well, you just don't keep your key data on a computer that's up to the web
[50:19.040 --> 50:21.040]  Now what does internet 2 do?
[50:21.040 --> 50:24.040]  It makes you put all your data on separate servers
[50:24.040 --> 50:26.040]  Which again gives the government industry control
[50:26.040 --> 50:29.040]  Hard on the outside with a soft chewy center
[50:29.040 --> 50:32.040]  This is the way many veteran computer security researchers think of such strategies
[50:32.040 --> 50:35.040]  Despite a thriving global security industry
[50:35.040 --> 50:38.040]  That is projected to reach 79 billion in revenues next year
[50:38.040 --> 50:42.040]  And the fact that 2002 Microsoft itself began an intense corporate-wide effort
[50:42.040 --> 50:43.040]  To improve the security of its software
[50:43.040 --> 50:46.040]  Internet security has continued to deteriorate globally
[50:46.040 --> 50:49.040]  No, it hasn't, this has made a new industry
[50:49.040 --> 50:53.040]  They're just hijacking the only growth industry we've got
[50:53.040 --> 50:55.040]  That's kept the economy afloat
[50:55.040 --> 50:57.040]  We'll come back and start going to your phone calls
[50:57.040 --> 51:00.040]  That's internet 2, they're coming after your internet
[51:01.040 --> 51:04.040]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize
[51:04.040 --> 51:07.040]  The conformity of the economic and political problems facing the US and the world
[51:07.040 --> 51:09.040]  And for the first time in their lives
[51:09.040 --> 51:11.040]  They are feeling the need for preparedness

[51:14.040 --> 51:18.040]  Manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years
[51:18.040 --> 51:20.040]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer
[51:20.040 --> 51:22.040]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods
[51:22.040 --> 51:25.040]  Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish
[51:25.040 --> 51:28.040]  With doubly-nameled cans and nitrogen packaging
[51:28.040 --> 51:30.040]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods
[51:30.040 --> 51:33.040]  You are buying factory direct at wholesale prices
[51:33.040 --> 51:36.040]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months
[51:36.040 --> 51:39.040]  While Ready Reserve ships within five business days
[51:39.040 --> 51:41.040]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog

[52:00.040 --> 52:03.040]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history
[52:03.040 --> 52:07.040]  A terrorist act of war against this country
[52:07.040 --> 52:09.040]  The enemy struck America on September 11th
[52:09.040 --> 52:11.040]  But who is the enemy?
[52:11.040 --> 52:12.040]  bin Laden
[52:12.040 --> 52:13.040]  This is his MO
[52:13.040 --> 52:14.040]  We have to look to the Middle East
[52:14.040 --> 52:16.040]  We have to look to Osama bin Laden
[52:16.040 --> 52:19.040]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look
[52:19.040 --> 52:23.040]  At the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States
[52:23.040 --> 52:26.040]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again
[52:26.040 --> 52:30.040]  Very much engaged in spying in and on the US
[52:30.040 --> 52:34.040]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained
[52:34.040 --> 52:36.040]  In Laden's connections to the CIA
[52:36.040 --> 52:38.040]  The hijackers ties to the FBI
[52:38.040 --> 52:39.040]  The Saudi Arabian connection
[52:39.040 --> 52:41.040]  The Israeli intelligence network
[52:41.040 --> 52:42.040]  Warnings and war games
[52:42.040 --> 52:43.040]  The shadow government
[52:43.040 --> 52:44.040]  And much, much more

[52:53.040 --> 52:57.040]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists
[53:23.040 --> 53:26.040]  This was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water
[53:26.040 --> 53:27.040]  But due to modern way of life
[53:27.040 --> 53:29.040]  Most people are overly acidic
[53:29.040 --> 53:33.040]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment
[53:33.040 --> 53:36.040]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis
[53:36.040 --> 53:38.040]  And doesn't neutralize it
[53:38.040 --> 53:39.040]  Do your part
[53:39.040 --> 53:41.040]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now
[53:41.040 --> 53:45.040]  Alcovision plasma pH drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate
[53:45.040 --> 53:47.040]  That raises the pH of the water you drink
[53:47.040 --> 53:49.040]  Up to the pH of 10
[53:49.040 --> 53:50.040]  With only 10 drops
[53:50.040 --> 53:53.040]  Order your bottle of Alcovision Plasma pH drops now
[53:53.040 --> 53:56.040]  By going directly to alkavision.com
[53:56.040 --> 53:59.040]  Again, that's alcovision.com
[54:03.040 --> 54:05.040]  Alright, I'm gonna get more into internet too
[54:05.040 --> 54:07.040]  And all the taxation and control that's coming in
[54:07.040 --> 54:09.040]  But they let an industry build up
[54:09.040 --> 54:11.040]  Diversify everybody, invest in it
[54:11.040 --> 54:13.040]  Then they just hijack the whole thing
[54:13.040 --> 54:16.040]  Kind of like we build the roads nationwide with our tax money
[54:16.040 --> 54:20.040]  Now, President Bush signed an executive order
[54:20.040 --> 54:23.040]  Obama is continuing the entire program
[54:23.040 --> 54:25.040]  To just by executive order
[54:25.040 --> 54:27.040]  Make states basically hand over their roads
[54:27.040 --> 54:29.040]  To fire on offshore companies
[54:29.040 --> 54:32.040]  To then slap toll roads on them
[54:32.040 --> 54:34.040]  It's the same thing, they're just pirates
[54:34.040 --> 54:35.040]  That's where the real power is
[54:35.040 --> 54:37.040]  Is in controlling government
[54:37.040 --> 54:39.040]  So that you as a private corporation
[54:39.040 --> 54:42.040]  Can pay off government to take over industries you want
[54:42.040 --> 54:44.040]  Let's go ahead and go to Hannibal in New York
[54:44.040 --> 54:47.040]  Hannibal, welcome
[54:47.040 --> 54:49.040]  Yes, go ahead
[54:49.040 --> 54:50.040]  Yes, go ahead
[54:50.040 --> 54:51.040]  Yeah, I'm from New York
[54:51.040 --> 54:54.040]  And I've been listening about two years
[54:54.040 --> 54:57.040]  I woke up when I first saw a video from Lukodosky
[54:57.040 --> 55:04.040]  When he confronted a guy in a YMCA
[55:04.040 --> 55:06.040]  Yeah, that was a big nerve, Brzezinski
[55:06.040 --> 55:08.040]  Yes
[55:08.040 --> 55:11.040]  Boy, I try to tell some close people to me
[55:11.040 --> 55:15.040]  They think I'm crazy about everything that's going on
[55:15.040 --> 55:16.040]  And stuff like that
[55:16.040 --> 55:18.040]  They say I'm like an occult
[55:18.040 --> 55:20.040]  And I lost a girlfriend over this
[55:20.040 --> 55:21.040]  That's right
[55:21.040 --> 55:24.040]  Questioning the government is cultic
[55:24.040 --> 55:25.040]  Trust them
[55:25.040 --> 55:27.040]  The pension funds aren't being robbed
[55:27.040 --> 55:29.040]  The fire and banks aren't taking it
[55:29.040 --> 55:31.040]  Newsweek isn't calling for world government run by the banks
[55:31.040 --> 55:33.040]  They are, but if you read Newsweek
[55:33.040 --> 55:35.040]  And read it to them, it doesn't exist
[55:35.040 --> 55:37.040]  Because they like being schmucks
[55:37.040 --> 55:39.040]  They like being slaves
[55:39.040 --> 55:41.040]  Because they like, they've been taught
[55:41.040 --> 55:44.040]  It's cute and fashionable to be an idiot
[55:44.040 --> 55:46.040]  Yeah, it's like the Matrix
[55:46.040 --> 55:48.040]  When they tell you to try to wake somebody up too late
[55:48.040 --> 55:51.040]  They do what they can to protect the Matrix
[55:51.040 --> 55:53.040]  I show them all the evidence and everything
[55:53.040 --> 55:55.040]  And they still deny it
[55:55.040 --> 55:57.040]  They do the double speak
[55:57.040 --> 56:00.040]  Well, you need to not worry about those particular people
[56:00.040 --> 56:03.040]  Let me guess, you're trying to wake up your friends and family
[56:03.040 --> 56:05.040]  Yeah, a lot of them are responding all the time
[56:05.040 --> 56:07.040]  They don't respect you, sir
[56:07.040 --> 56:08.040]  They don't respect you
[56:08.040 --> 56:11.040]  They'll have better luck with people that don't know you
[56:11.040 --> 56:13.040]  Yeah, I've had better luck with people
[56:13.040 --> 56:15.040]  I'm spreading news up around the east side
[56:15.040 --> 56:17.040]  In Manhattan
[56:17.040 --> 56:20.040]  And I get a good response
[56:20.040 --> 56:22.040]  Not like when I was watching you
[56:22.040 --> 56:23.040]  Yeah, just don't waste your time
[56:23.040 --> 56:25.040]  Hey, don't waste your time
[56:25.040 --> 56:28.040]  Give your friends and family videos and articles and information
[56:28.040 --> 56:30.040]  And just say, hey, I care about you
[56:30.040 --> 56:32.040]  See, they think you're trying to show off
[56:32.040 --> 56:34.040]  That you're uppity and smart
[56:34.040 --> 56:37.040]  Yeah, he actually emailed me a remark like that
[56:37.040 --> 56:39.040]  Say I was too smart for her
[56:39.040 --> 56:41.040]  No, no, no, I understand they're programming
[56:41.040 --> 56:43.040]  So just say, look, I love you
[56:43.040 --> 56:46.040]  That's why I'm giving this a lateral you'll understand
[56:46.040 --> 56:48.040]  And then later they will
[56:48.040 --> 56:50.040]  If you bow up to them and try to argue back
[56:50.040 --> 56:52.040]  They'll get that demonic smile that's all been programmed
[56:52.040 --> 56:54.040]  Very complex programming to go into
[56:54.040 --> 56:56.040]  But they'll get that little smirk
[56:56.040 --> 56:58.040]  They'll stick their tongue out a little bit
[56:58.040 --> 57:00.040]  Like a little snake and then giggle
[57:00.040 --> 57:02.040]  And that's the spirit of weakness
[57:02.040 --> 57:04.040]  And the spirit of enslavement
[57:04.040 --> 57:07.040]  And just to say, I understand it's scary
[57:07.040 --> 57:08.040]  Just check it out
[57:08.040 --> 57:11.040]  And then down the road, they will be abused by the system
[57:11.040 --> 57:13.040]  And then they'll remember
[57:13.040 --> 57:17.040]  Well, actually they were like somewhat abused by the system
[57:17.040 --> 57:19.040]  And they still deny it
[57:19.040 --> 57:22.040]  That's because they can't admit they were abused
[57:22.040 --> 57:24.040]  Because then they would think they were powerless
[57:24.040 --> 57:26.040]  See
[57:26.040 --> 57:28.040]  Okay
[57:28.040 --> 57:30.040]  You understand the psychology?
[57:30.040 --> 57:33.040]  Well, sort of, yeah
[57:33.040 --> 57:36.040]  Look, if I was you, I would just worry about yourself
[57:36.040 --> 57:38.040]  Getting yourself prepared for what's coming
[57:38.040 --> 57:39.040]  And what's already going on
[57:39.040 --> 57:42.040]  And I would try to reach out to those that care
[57:42.040 --> 57:45.040]  I would try to
[57:45.040 --> 57:47.040]  I mean, the power of just somebody like you
[57:47.040 --> 57:49.040]  So going into an ABC News
[57:49.040 --> 57:51.040]  Or a Sean Hannity message board
[57:51.040 --> 57:54.040]  Or, you know, into mainline message boards
[57:54.040 --> 57:55.040]  And posting links
[57:55.040 --> 57:58.040]  And saying, hey, what do you think of this story
[57:58.040 --> 58:00.040]  About FEMA camps being built
[58:00.040 --> 58:01.040]  And then what will happen is
[58:01.040 --> 58:03.040]  They'll have moderators that will say, that's ridiculous
[58:03.040 --> 58:04.040]  It doesn't exist
[58:04.040 --> 58:06.040]  But somebody will click the link and go, no, no, no
[58:06.040 --> 58:08.040]  That's a mainstream news story
[58:08.040 --> 58:10.040]  And then a whole debate will ensue
[58:10.040 --> 58:12.040]  See, we do to them what they do to us
[58:12.040 --> 58:14.040]  But instead of coming in with disinfo lies and distractions
[58:14.040 --> 58:16.040]  We come in with info bombs
[58:16.040 --> 58:18.040]  Plant the seed and move on
[58:18.040 --> 58:19.040]  Plant the seed and move on
[58:19.040 --> 58:21.040]  The best place is the internet
[58:21.040 --> 58:23.040]  That's why they're wanting to shut it down
[58:23.040 --> 58:25.040]  But also, wear a pro-liberty t-shirt
[58:25.040 --> 58:27.040]  Walk around downtown
[58:27.040 --> 58:28.040]  You'll meet like-minded people
[58:28.040 --> 58:30.040]  Then create cadres in your areas
[58:30.040 --> 58:33.040]  And then expand the physical info war
[58:33.040 --> 58:35.040]  Through information spread
[58:35.040 --> 58:37.040]  In the physical plane
[58:37.040 --> 58:39.040]  As well as the internet
[58:42.040 --> 58:45.040]  Thank you for listening to GCN
[58:45.040 --> 58:50.040]  Visit GCNLive.com today
[58:50.040 --> 58:52.040]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones
[58:52.040 --> 58:55.040]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient
[58:55.040 --> 58:57.040]  And today that's more important than ever
[58:57.040 --> 58:58.040]  We need to be independent
[58:58.040 --> 59:00.040]  And food and water is the key
[59:00.040 --> 59:02.040]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line
[59:02.040 --> 59:03.040]  If you have your own bread
[59:03.040 --> 59:05.040]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome
[59:05.040 --> 59:07.040]  And beg for FEMA to take care of your family
[59:07.040 --> 59:09.040]  In any emergency, if you simply prepare
[59:09.040 --> 59:11.040]  No one is going to take care of your family
[59:11.040 --> 59:13.040]  In the final equation, but you
[59:13.040 --> 59:15.040]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to
[59:15.040 --> 59:17.040]  Shift horrible food that's safe from E. coli,
[59:17.040 --> 59:19.040]  Salmonella genetic alteration, or Chinese imports
[59:19.040 --> 59:21.040]  And they do it at almost half the cost
[59:21.040 --> 59:23.040]  Of last year's grocery prices
[59:23.040 --> 59:25.040]  Call 1-800-409-5633

[1:00:05.040 --> 1:00:06.040]  Big brother
[1:00:06.040 --> 1:00:08.040]  Mainstream media
[1:00:08.040 --> 1:00:10.040]  Government cover-ups
[1:00:10.040 --> 1:00:11.040]  You want answers?
[1:00:11.040 --> 1:00:13.040]  Well, so does he
[1:00:13.040 --> 1:00:17.040]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[1:00:17.040 --> 1:00:20.040]  And now, live from Austin, Texas
[1:00:20.040 --> 1:00:22.040]  Alex Jones
[1:00:22.040 --> 1:00:25.040]  We are now into hour number two
[1:00:25.040 --> 1:00:27.040]  Another guest joining us on the
[1:00:27.040 --> 1:00:28.040]  State's rights issue
[1:00:28.040 --> 1:00:30.040]  As states declare sovereignty in the next hour
[1:00:30.040 --> 1:00:34.040]  Gonna get into some other important stories
[1:00:34.040 --> 1:00:36.040]  Like pills that erase bad memories
[1:00:36.040 --> 1:00:40.040]  Ethical furor over drugs that threaten human identity
[1:00:40.040 --> 1:00:42.040]  We'll get into some other important stories
[1:00:42.040 --> 1:00:46.040]  Dealing with $65.5 trillion federal obligation
[1:00:46.040 --> 1:00:49.040]  Exceeds world gross domestic product
[1:00:49.040 --> 1:00:51.040]  Right now though, let's go back to your calls
[1:00:51.040 --> 1:00:53.040]  Patreot Bear, James Randy and others
[1:00:53.040 --> 1:00:55.040]  Dylan in Toronto, you're on the air
[1:00:55.040 --> 1:00:57.040]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[1:00:57.040 --> 1:00:58.040]  Good sir
[1:00:58.040 --> 1:01:01.040]  It's actually really good that you're talking about the internet too
[1:01:01.040 --> 1:01:04.040]  They actually just did a video for my site for the internet too yesterday
[1:01:04.040 --> 1:01:07.040]  I thought that you'd be interested in a case that's going on today
[1:01:07.040 --> 1:01:09.040]  Actually with PirateBay.com
[1:01:09.040 --> 1:01:12.040]  It's a torrent file sharing website
[1:01:12.040 --> 1:01:15.040]  And they're getting a friend of being shut down
[1:01:15.040 --> 1:01:18.040]  The problem the government's having is that it is big
[1:01:18.040 --> 1:01:20.040]  Sorry, it's based in Europe
[1:01:20.040 --> 1:01:25.040]  So what they're doing is they're pushing these legislations and law behind this case
[1:01:25.040 --> 1:01:27.040]  Making it look like a copyright issue case
[1:01:27.040 --> 1:01:32.040]  But really they're saying that they want to hold the internet service providers themselves liable
[1:01:32.040 --> 1:01:34.040]  That if they allow access to sites like these
[1:01:34.040 --> 1:01:36.040]  So they're giving these internet service providers
[1:01:36.040 --> 1:01:39.040]  Yeah, that's how they're going to shut it down
[1:01:39.040 --> 1:01:42.040]  They're saying, oh, Time Warner and Comcast
[1:01:42.040 --> 1:01:44.040]  And all the big internet companies
[1:01:44.040 --> 1:01:47.040]  Which even if you're on a small company, you go through them
[1:01:47.040 --> 1:01:51.040]  They're saying that they have a liability
[1:01:51.040 --> 1:01:52.040]  Which is not true
[1:01:52.040 --> 1:01:56.040]  They actually own most of the big music and movie companies as well and other subsidiaries
[1:01:56.040 --> 1:01:59.040]  So they're threatening action against themselves
[1:01:59.040 --> 1:02:03.040]  Saying, oh, we have to create a safe list
[1:02:03.040 --> 1:02:06.040]  Of sites that are approved
[1:02:06.040 --> 1:02:08.040]  So that we don't have liability
[1:02:08.040 --> 1:02:11.040]  As if they have a liability because they allow somebody to go to a site
[1:02:11.040 --> 1:02:13.040]  That is supposedly infringing copyright
[1:02:13.040 --> 1:02:16.040]  Again, that's one of the ways
[1:02:16.040 --> 1:02:18.040]  They're shutting the web down now
[1:02:18.040 --> 1:02:20.040]  It's happening now
[1:02:20.040 --> 1:02:21.040]  Go ahead
[1:02:21.040 --> 1:02:24.040]  Exactly, and it's funny because you know what these companies are already
[1:02:24.040 --> 1:02:26.040]  Pro New World Order anyway
[1:02:26.040 --> 1:02:28.040]  So they're just laughing when they say stuff like that
[1:02:28.040 --> 1:02:32.040]  Well, no, listen, listen, Time Warner and all these guys own whole movie divisions
[1:02:32.040 --> 1:02:34.040]  Exactly, yeah
[1:02:34.040 --> 1:02:36.040]  And there's another thing that you need to know about too
[1:02:36.040 --> 1:02:38.040]  That you haven't talked about yet
[1:02:38.040 --> 1:02:40.040]  In Ontario, Canada, I'm actually an American
[1:02:40.040 --> 1:02:42.040]  But in Toronto for business
[1:02:42.040 --> 1:02:46.040]  But in Ontario, Canada, recently a judge ruled that
[1:02:46.040 --> 1:02:52.040]  Authorities do not need search warrants to obtain IP addresses now
[1:02:52.040 --> 1:02:54.040]  I saw that article yesterday
[1:02:54.040 --> 1:02:56.040]  It came out on a Saturday
[1:02:56.040 --> 1:02:58.040]  With worldwide implications
[1:02:58.040 --> 1:03:00.040]  Because all the different internet companies go through Canada
[1:03:00.040 --> 1:03:02.040]  Even if they're not based there
[1:03:02.040 --> 1:03:04.040]  And they're saying that without a warrant
[1:03:04.040 --> 1:03:07.040]  That the police will be able to have access basically to everything
[1:03:07.040 --> 1:03:10.040]  And everybody's internet history
[1:03:10.040 --> 1:03:12.040]  And again, that just completely
[1:03:12.040 --> 1:03:15.040]  Just annihilates privacy
[1:03:15.040 --> 1:03:17.040]  And allows Big Brother in
[1:03:17.040 --> 1:03:19.040]  They're making their move on the web right now
[1:03:19.040 --> 1:03:21.040]  Definitely, and I don't want to connect too many dots
[1:03:21.040 --> 1:03:24.040]  But I thought it could be pretty scary
[1:03:24.040 --> 1:03:27.040]  When you look at, like, they can go to info wars.com, for example
[1:03:27.040 --> 1:03:29.040]  And see the IP address that have accessed that
[1:03:29.040 --> 1:03:31.040]  And then get your name, which leaves your address
[1:03:31.040 --> 1:03:34.040]  And just makes it really scary when you start talking about it
[1:03:34.040 --> 1:03:39.040]  Well, they still have to go and demand that
[1:03:39.040 --> 1:03:41.040]  And most service providers are still refusing it
[1:03:41.040 --> 1:03:43.040]  So that's a Canadian case
[1:03:43.040 --> 1:03:45.040]  And there's other case law saying they can't do that
[1:03:45.040 --> 1:03:48.040]  The point is this fight is ongoing
[1:03:48.040 --> 1:03:51.040]  All right, well, I appreciate you talking about, Alex
[1:03:51.040 --> 1:03:53.040]  Yeah, I'm glad you brought up those key points
[1:03:53.040 --> 1:03:54.040]  And that's what I mean
[1:03:54.040 --> 1:03:56.040]  There's just so much going on
[1:03:56.040 --> 1:03:59.040]  So many attacks on the internet as we know it
[1:03:59.040 --> 1:04:04.040]  Listen, about half the packages we ship into Canada get intercepted
[1:04:04.040 --> 1:04:06.040]  My films, the books, the other videos we carry
[1:04:06.040 --> 1:04:08.040]  Mainline, totally legal
[1:04:08.040 --> 1:04:10.040]  My films are sold, you know, in Barnes and Nobles in places
[1:04:10.040 --> 1:04:12.040]  In Canada
[1:04:12.040 --> 1:04:14.040]  We go through UPS, we send it through customs
[1:04:14.040 --> 1:04:16.040]  We fill out all the paperwork
[1:04:16.040 --> 1:04:18.040]  They just take them out, smash them all
[1:04:18.040 --> 1:04:22.040]  And then part of the time, ship back the smashed packages to us
[1:04:22.040 --> 1:04:27.040]  Canada is worse than China anywhere on shipping things in
[1:04:27.040 --> 1:04:29.040]  They search your mail
[1:04:29.040 --> 1:04:33.040]  Now, do you think they like the fact that Canadians can just go to
[1:04:33.040 --> 1:04:38.040]  PrisonPlanet.tv, bypass all that government censorship
[1:04:38.040 --> 1:04:40.040]  And see all my films in super high quality?
[1:04:40.040 --> 1:04:41.040]  No, they don't like that
[1:04:41.040 --> 1:04:43.040]  And we're kicking their butt
[1:04:43.040 --> 1:04:46.040]  We're exposing all the criminal activities that they're engaged in
[1:04:46.040 --> 1:04:48.040]  That governments are engaged in
[1:04:48.040 --> 1:04:50.040]  And it's hurting them
[1:04:50.040 --> 1:04:52.040]  We are giving them a serious bloody nose
[1:04:52.040 --> 1:04:54.040]  We're in this fight
[1:04:54.040 --> 1:04:56.040]  That's why they need to shut the web down
[1:04:56.040 --> 1:05:00.040]  And if we politically say no, they're not going to be able to get away with it
[1:05:00.040 --> 1:05:04.040]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet
[1:05:04.040 --> 1:05:06.040]  With so many different methods of consumption
[1:05:06.040 --> 1:05:10.040]  How do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[1:05:10.040 --> 1:05:14.040]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer
[1:05:14.040 --> 1:05:17.040]  Nature's Gem, premium omega-3
[1:05:17.040 --> 1:05:21.040]  Unlike other flax seed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota
[1:05:21.040 --> 1:05:24.040]  Providing cooler temperatures and longer summer hours
[1:05:24.040 --> 1:05:28.040]  Producing the highest quality premium golden flax seed around

[1:05:33.040 --> 1:05:37.040]  Keeping only the best seeds that can produce the highest abundance of omega-3

[1:05:40.040 --> 1:05:42.040]  Nature's Gem golden flax is pure

[1:06:01.040 --> 1:06:04.040]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history
[1:06:04.040 --> 1:06:07.040]  A terrorist act of war against this country
[1:06:07.040 --> 1:06:10.040]  The enemy struck America on September 11th
[1:06:10.040 --> 1:06:11.040]  But who is the enemy?
[1:06:11.040 --> 1:06:12.040]  Bin Laden
[1:06:12.040 --> 1:06:14.040]  This is his M.O.
[1:06:14.040 --> 1:06:17.040]  We have to look to the Middle East, we have to look to Osama Bin Laden
[1:06:17.040 --> 1:06:24.040]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States
[1:06:24.040 --> 1:06:31.040]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[1:06:31.040 --> 1:06:35.040]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained
[1:06:35.040 --> 1:06:42.040]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[1:06:42.040 --> 1:06:47.040]  American war games, the shadow government, and much, much more fabled enemies

[1:07:04.040 --> 1:07:07.040]  Welcome to America, it's time for change
[1:07:07.040 --> 1:07:10.040]  The new president is talking about change
[1:07:10.040 --> 1:07:15.040]  Talking about change? You know, changing your lifestyle to become more healthy?
[1:07:15.040 --> 1:07:18.040]  Well, here's how the staff at Life Change T feels

[1:07:20.040 --> 1:07:24.040]  Before your body forces you to change
[1:07:24.040 --> 1:07:31.040]  Organ failure, sickness, chemical poisoning, toxins, and much more
[1:07:31.040 --> 1:07:34.040]  They'll force you to change for the worse
[1:07:34.040 --> 1:07:38.040]  But willing change is much better than a change by force

[1:08:00.040 --> 1:08:06.040]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines
[1:08:06.040 --> 1:08:08.040]  The Information War continues
[1:08:08.040 --> 1:08:12.040]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[1:08:12.040 --> 1:08:14.040]  We are continuing with your phone calls
[1:08:14.040 --> 1:08:16.040]  And I have several audio clips I want to play
[1:08:16.040 --> 1:08:20.040]  People criticizing me so we can analyze their psychology
[1:08:20.040 --> 1:08:24.040]  Because these guys are what I'd call art types out there
[1:08:24.040 --> 1:08:28.040]  And it's important for these guys and people
[1:08:28.040 --> 1:08:33.040]  To think like them to understand where they are missing the boat
[1:08:33.040 --> 1:08:36.040]  But right now let's go back to the calls
[1:08:36.040 --> 1:08:39.040]  Patriot Bear in California
[1:08:39.040 --> 1:08:41.040]  Good morning Alex
[1:08:41.040 --> 1:08:43.040]  Hello
[1:08:43.040 --> 1:08:46.040]  I'm calling from the high desert in California
[1:08:46.040 --> 1:08:48.040]  I'm a retired Air Force military
[1:08:48.040 --> 1:08:52.040]  I'm a subscriber to Prison Planet PV
[1:08:52.040 --> 1:08:53.040]  Thank you
[1:08:53.040 --> 1:08:55.040]  And you're welcome
[1:08:55.040 --> 1:08:59.040]  Over a year and a half ago when I got a job at a military base in California
[1:08:59.040 --> 1:09:04.040]  There were a few stations that would come in because of the building I worked in
[1:09:04.040 --> 1:09:08.040]  And one of them was, your show was on that station
[1:09:08.040 --> 1:09:11.040]  And I didn't really take you serious back then
[1:09:11.040 --> 1:09:13.040]  I said, is this guy for real or what?
[1:09:13.040 --> 1:09:17.040]  I just, because of the way that they program you
[1:09:17.040 --> 1:09:20.040]  When you watch the news and you watch shows and all that
[1:09:20.040 --> 1:09:23.040]  When you hear something that's conspiracy and all that
[1:09:23.040 --> 1:09:26.040]  You don't know if it's, can you take this guy for real or what?
[1:09:26.040 --> 1:09:31.040]  And then they took you off the air and they put you on the waiter on for only an hour
[1:09:31.040 --> 1:09:34.040]  So I didn't really listen to you anymore and then I said
[1:09:34.040 --> 1:09:36.040]  What happened to that Alex Jones guy?
[1:09:36.040 --> 1:09:40.040]  So I browsed you and I found your site
[1:09:40.040 --> 1:09:42.040]  And you started talking about the FEMA camps
[1:09:42.040 --> 1:09:45.040]  So I did some research on the FEMA camps in Google
[1:09:45.040 --> 1:09:47.040]  And this is what I came up with
[1:09:47.040 --> 1:09:50.040]  You ever heard of Mindful.org?
[1:09:50.040 --> 1:09:52.040]  Mindful.org
[1:09:52.040 --> 1:09:57.040]  Okay, well they have an article in here back in 2004
[1:09:57.040 --> 1:10:01.040]  And if you would let me read a couple paragraphs real quickly
[1:10:01.040 --> 1:10:07.040]  It says, should martial law need to be implemented in the United States
[1:10:07.040 --> 1:10:11.040]  All it would take is a presidential signature on a proclamation
[1:10:11.040 --> 1:10:16.040]  And a attorney general's signature on a warrant to which a list of names is attached
[1:10:16.040 --> 1:10:19.040]  Ask yourself if you really want to be on Ash Cross List
[1:10:19.040 --> 1:10:24.040]  Rex 84 program was established on the reasoning that
[1:10:24.040 --> 1:10:29.040]  If the mass exodus of illegal aliens across the Mexican U.S. border
[1:10:29.040 --> 1:10:34.040]  They would be quickly rounded up and detained detention centers by FEMA
[1:10:34.040 --> 1:10:39.040]  And then sir, that is to be used, they admit in Rex 84 as the cover story
[1:10:39.040 --> 1:10:43.040]  And now we're hearing in the El Paso Times, oh they're getting ready for martial law
[1:10:43.040 --> 1:10:47.040]  In FEMA camps for Mexico to collapse
[1:10:47.040 --> 1:10:52.040]  And they use these cover stories with the local police
[1:10:52.040 --> 1:10:56.040]  Yes, sir, you can go to the Houston Chronicle, you can go to the San Francisco Chronicle
[1:10:56.040 --> 1:11:01.040]  You can go to the Army Times now and read about FEMA camps and troops to be used against the American people
[1:11:01.040 --> 1:11:05.040]  And that's what shocks me as folks are making YouTube videos saying I'm making this up
[1:11:05.040 --> 1:11:09.040]  When it's all over the news now, which means they're getting ready
[1:11:09.040 --> 1:11:13.040]  Or at least are thinking about going live with this
[1:11:13.040 --> 1:11:16.040]  And actually doing it, but if you want to read more of the article, go ahead
[1:11:16.040 --> 1:11:26.040]  What I wanted to tell you was it also shows each state which camp is at which city and all that
[1:11:26.040 --> 1:11:29.040]  Which is closed bases and all that
[1:11:29.040 --> 1:11:33.040]  And then it also gives the executive orders, it shows the whole thing
[1:11:33.040 --> 1:11:41.040]  And then mindfully.org has a note, it says it may be easy to find fault with the premises of this article
[1:11:41.040 --> 1:11:45.040]  You may even know of numerous sites that are not used as camps
[1:11:45.040 --> 1:11:49.040]  But the plain fact remains that the U.S. maintains illegal prisons around the world
[1:11:49.040 --> 1:11:55.040]  And remains secrecy only to, I can't remember what that says
[1:11:55.040 --> 1:11:59.040]  And Obama is continuing all of that
[1:11:59.040 --> 1:12:02.040]  And the way things are going on in the U.S. it's not a matter of if
[1:12:02.040 --> 1:12:08.040]  But when these unused facilities come online to serve the master, otherwise known as MOLOC
[1:12:08.040 --> 1:12:10.040]  Mostly likely not Japanese
[1:12:10.040 --> 1:12:12.040]  In the U.S. dealt the premises of this article
[1:12:12.040 --> 1:12:16.040]  Or choose in Europe during the Holocaust, the article must hit hard to know
[1:12:16.040 --> 1:12:19.040]  So what makes you think it can happen here?
[1:12:19.040 --> 1:12:24.040]  Let me just ask you a question, does that article source all the mainstream news admitting it?
[1:12:24.040 --> 1:12:28.040]  It comes from Friends of Liberty
[1:12:28.040 --> 1:12:31.040]  Listen, I appreciate your call, I appreciate your call
[1:12:31.040 --> 1:12:33.040]  I'm going to hear from you
[1:12:33.040 --> 1:12:36.040]  Look, this is what I found
[1:12:36.040 --> 1:12:41.040]  People email me constantly with articles
[1:12:41.040 --> 1:12:44.040]  That don't link to all the admissions
[1:12:44.040 --> 1:12:48.040]  When we write, I don't understand this, I really don't
[1:12:48.040 --> 1:12:52.040]  And I'm not talking about this particular article, I haven't seen it
[1:12:52.040 --> 1:12:56.040]  But when I hear articles where it goes, you may not believe this or it may not be proven
[1:12:56.040 --> 1:12:59.040]  And I never understand those stories
[1:12:59.040 --> 1:13:04.040]  It is on record that FEMA camps have been built all over the United States
[1:13:04.040 --> 1:13:10.040]  It is on record the military is training to confiscate your firearms and put you in them
[1:13:10.040 --> 1:13:13.040]  It is in the congressional record
[1:13:13.040 --> 1:13:17.040]  The Pentagon has openly announced it
[1:13:17.040 --> 1:13:22.040]  The bills have been introduced or passed, the camps have been built
[1:13:22.040 --> 1:13:30.040]  And 99% of the time, now I'd say 95% of the time, when I see other people's sites or news sites
[1:13:30.040 --> 1:13:32.040]  It doesn't source any of it
[1:13:32.040 --> 1:13:39.040]  They just say we've heard camps are being built and maybe they'll mention Rex 84
[1:13:39.040 --> 1:13:42.040]  Folks, this is not a opinion
[1:13:42.040 --> 1:13:47.040]  This is not speculation
[1:13:47.040 --> 1:13:51.040]  I'll be on Coast to Coast A.M. tonight talking about this and I'm going to read bill numbers on air
[1:13:51.040 --> 1:13:53.040]  I'm going to read Pentagon directives on air
[1:13:53.040 --> 1:13:55.040]  I'm going to give you where you can get them
[1:13:55.040 --> 1:14:01.040]  Folks, they had secret camps from 1986 to 1997
[1:14:01.040 --> 1:14:08.040]  Operating at 24 locations in the United States with people in them
[1:14:08.040 --> 1:14:11.040]  Now I'm going to give you the source
[1:14:11.040 --> 1:14:20.040]  The civilian inmate labor camp program
[1:14:20.040 --> 1:14:29.040]  The civilian inmate labor camp program
[1:14:29.040 --> 1:14:35.040]  And you'll go read it and go, oh yeah, they do say they secretly had federal prisoners at military bases under military control
[1:14:35.040 --> 1:14:40.040]  These were not military prisoners, these were people from regular federal prison civilians
[1:14:40.040 --> 1:14:46.040]  This was not somebody that hauled off and punched their sergeant in boot camp
[1:14:46.040 --> 1:14:52.040]  These are non-military prisoners in there working in labor camps
[1:14:52.040 --> 1:14:55.040]  And they kept it secret for 11 years
[1:14:55.040 --> 1:14:58.040]  Then it was declassified in 97
[1:14:58.040 --> 1:15:06.040]  Civilian inmate labor camp program
[1:15:06.040 --> 1:15:09.040]  You can go to the Army times and read about them
[1:15:09.040 --> 1:15:13.040]  Preparing to use 20,000 combat troops against the American people
[1:15:13.040 --> 1:15:17.040]  You can read the John Warner Defense Authorization Act saying the governors run nothing
[1:15:17.040 --> 1:15:20.040]  The military and North Comrade everything can read PDD-51
[1:15:20.040 --> 1:15:26.040]  You can watch video clips of House committee chairmen saying they're not allowed to see PDD-51 in its entirety
[1:15:26.040 --> 1:15:30.040]  Marshall law, we can play clips of Senator Inhofe saying they've been threatened with Marshall law
[1:15:30.040 --> 1:15:35.040]  I can show you Bloomberg headlines with Federal Reserve governors saying that they're not even involved now
[1:15:35.040 --> 1:15:39.040]  That war powers act has been declared and the New York feds running the country
[1:15:39.040 --> 1:15:44.040]  It's all there, it's all documented, it's all real
[1:15:44.040 --> 1:15:52.040]  And I've told Kurt Nemo, Paul Watson has a FEMA camp section, a data page at the bottom of prisonplanet.com
[1:15:52.040 --> 1:15:58.040]  I got Kurt Nemo today making a FEMA camp Marshall law gun control master page
[1:15:58.040 --> 1:16:01.040]  And making a states rights page, that's gonna be done
[1:16:01.040 --> 1:16:04.040]  We're gonna do more and more of this, we just haven't had the personnel get it all done
[1:16:04.040 --> 1:16:08.040]  We're too busy writing the articles to ever collate them all
[1:16:08.040 --> 1:16:11.040]  And I'm not bashing you, Patriot Bear, I'm glad you called
[1:16:11.040 --> 1:16:16.040]  I just, millions of times people, thousands of times they've called me and said
[1:16:16.040 --> 1:16:20.040]  You know, I didn't believe you, but what do you think of this article, is it real?
[1:16:20.040 --> 1:16:24.040]  It's real, folks. James in Pennsylvania, you're on the air
[1:16:24.040 --> 1:16:26.040]  Yes, hello, can you hear me?
[1:16:26.040 --> 1:16:27.040]  Yes, sir
[1:16:27.040 --> 1:16:30.040]  Hi, I have two important questions
[1:16:30.040 --> 1:16:35.040]  One, being on SSRI, I'm on a medicine called Lexapro
[1:16:35.040 --> 1:16:39.040]  For those that don't know, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, go ahead
[1:16:39.040 --> 1:16:43.040]  Yeah, and I hear, I've been listening for a few months now
[1:16:43.040 --> 1:16:45.040]  And I've heard some things about Prozac and stuff
[1:16:45.040 --> 1:16:50.040]  But I just want to know, are all the SSRIs the same, and what exactly do they do that's harmful?
[1:16:50.040 --> 1:16:56.040]  Yes, have you read the, you know, Donardine Adele that we've had on?
[1:16:56.040 --> 1:17:02.040]  Every time I tune into him, he's, autism is not caused by Mercury
[1:17:02.040 --> 1:17:06.040]  Mercury's not bad for you, all supplements are bad, it's all made up
[1:17:06.040 --> 1:17:10.040]  Blah, blah, blah, all these cooks practice medicine than our doctors
[1:17:10.040 --> 1:17:14.040]  When I get up here, and I cover things, I'm going off the studies
[1:17:14.040 --> 1:17:19.040]  I'm going off, off of neuro-scientists, brain surgeons, neurologists
[1:17:19.040 --> 1:17:23.040]  I'm going off the experts, hundreds of them we've interviewed over the years
[1:17:23.040 --> 1:17:30.040]  All you need to do is read the insert for Prozac and the other major brands of the serotonin reuptake inhibitors
[1:17:30.040 --> 1:17:34.040]  And it admits what comes in the box, not what Alex said
[1:17:34.040 --> 1:17:38.040]  You see, Dina Adele doesn't want you reading this, because he's funded by the drug companies
[1:17:38.040 --> 1:17:43.040]  You go and you read, and it says it causes violent psychopathic breaks
[1:17:43.040 --> 1:17:47.040]  Suicidal tendencies, violent outbursts, depression
[1:17:47.040 --> 1:17:53.040]  And they've done double blind placebo test, and sugar pill is better than Prozac for depression
[1:17:53.040 --> 1:17:59.040]  They've done medical double blind on St. John's wort, and it actually does help with depression
[1:17:59.040 --> 1:18:07.040]  Sugar pill doesn't do anything, Prozac hurts you, and yes, they're all made out of the fluoride molecule
[1:18:07.040 --> 1:18:14.040]  And they are toxic, they actually attack body tissues, it's all on record
[1:18:14.040 --> 1:18:22.040]  Just like I told everybody, that the HPV shot, the quote cancer cure shot, was killing people
[1:18:22.040 --> 1:18:27.040]  I mean, do you think I get up on air and say that? I'd be sued if it wasn't true, by Merck
[1:18:27.040 --> 1:18:33.040]  It was in their trials, it killed people, they admit it kills people
[1:18:33.040 --> 1:18:39.040]  But see, they'll have thousands of studies against them, and so they'll go out and the drug companies do this
[1:18:39.040 --> 1:18:46.040]  And they'll go off and pay off one doctor, to then come out and say he put out fake info, say against Mercury and vaccines
[1:18:46.040 --> 1:18:51.040]  And they'll see it's all discredited, there's no autism, everything's fine, Mercury's good for you
[1:18:51.040 --> 1:18:53.040]  You see what I'm saying?
[1:18:53.040 --> 1:18:54.040]  Yes, I see
[1:18:54.040 --> 1:18:58.040]  Let me ask you, how did you get on serotonin reuptake inhibitors?
[1:18:58.040 --> 1:19:03.040]  Well, I've had a severe anxiety problem since elementary school, I'm 18 now
[1:19:03.040 --> 1:19:05.040]  How did that start?
[1:19:05.040 --> 1:19:06.040]  How did that start?
[1:19:06.040 --> 1:19:11.040]  That just started one day in the fifth grade, I started getting sick just going forward
[1:19:11.040 --> 1:19:15.040]  Let me ask, were you drinking Coca-Cola and eating big sugar, sugar cakes?
[1:19:15.040 --> 1:19:17.040]  Yeah, like the average kid, I was
[1:19:17.040 --> 1:19:24.040]  Yeah, I mean, what do you think, I'm an adult, and if I eat a big sugar donut with jelly filled, and drink a Coca-Cola, I start bouncing off the walls
[1:19:24.040 --> 1:19:31.040]  I mean, have you had a dog, a puppy, have you seen that mammal, young mammals, have a lot of energy, have you seen that?
[1:19:31.040 --> 1:19:32.040]  Oh yes
[1:19:32.040 --> 1:19:38.040]  Okay, well you give a dog a jelly donut and some Coca-Cola, and that thing is going to go completely insane
[1:19:40.040 --> 1:19:46.040]  So instead of you getting good nutrition, let me guess, did they put you on Redland first?
[1:19:46.040 --> 1:19:49.040]  No, no, just went straight to the election pro
[1:19:49.040 --> 1:19:55.040]  Okay, let's talk about it when we get back, stay there and I'll tell you exactly what's going on with this
[1:19:55.040 --> 1:20:21.040]  All right, what you need to do is get fired up

[1:24:27.040 --> 1:24:30.040]  Let it all hang out. Cause we got a run to me
[1:24:30.040 --> 1:24:33.040]  The boys are ferst big in Atlanta
[1:24:33.040 --> 1:24:27.140]  And there's beer and Texas
[1:24:32.640 --> 1:24:35.300]  Connor and we'll bring it
[1:24:36.460 --> 1:24:38.300]  Alright, let's go back to James
[1:24:38.920 --> 1:24:41.240]  James, they put these machines
[1:24:41.240 --> 1:24:44.180]  All this candy, all this crud food
[1:24:44.180 --> 1:24:46.360]  In the school lunch programs
[1:24:47.560 --> 1:24:50.000]  And the children eat the food
[1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:52.380]  Then they crash from it, then they're depressed
[1:24:52.540 --> 1:24:56.320]  And then they put them on Reddling prozac and a bunch of other things
[1:24:56.320 --> 1:25:00.660]  other things. It's come out to big drug companies that the New Freedom Initiative bragged their
[1:25:00.660 --> 1:25:04.240]  internal documents came out four years ago that they'd already put 20 percent of kids
[1:25:04.240 --> 1:25:08.980]  on these drugs. They wanted to put half of American school children on them. Children
[1:25:08.980 --> 1:25:17.020]  in their custody, 67 percent of the nation's foster children are on more than one SSR drug
[1:25:17.020 --> 1:25:26.260]  and on the Riddlin class of drugs. So what happened is they gave you sugar. They gave
[1:25:26.260 --> 1:25:30.800]  you caffeine. They gave you all of this. You bounced off the walls. They said you had
[1:25:30.800 --> 1:25:35.680]  anxiety problems and people even though they're eating healthy, if they don't have a lot of
[1:25:35.680 --> 1:25:39.960]  physical action, if they're not playing sports, if they're not running around the playground
[1:25:39.960 --> 1:25:44.760]  at least a few hours a day, they get antsy. They have anxiety. I mean, it's normal when
[1:25:44.760 --> 1:25:51.480]  you're 12 years old and you ask that girl in your class to meet you at the movies or
[1:25:51.480 --> 1:25:56.980]  at the mall to get butterflies, to have anxiety. Or when the bully, you know, after school
[1:25:56.980 --> 1:25:59.920]  you're walking home and he comes over and starts shoving you and pushing you, you have
[1:25:59.920 --> 1:26:07.620]  anxiety. That is your power. That is your engine. That is your soul. That's your mind.
[1:26:07.620 --> 1:26:13.160]  Your glands giving you the real drugs that are in your body that you're meant to have.
[1:26:13.160 --> 1:26:16.740]  And you're meant to work through those things and learn to deal with anxiety and learn to
[1:26:16.740 --> 1:26:23.320]  use it. I love it because it fuels me. I mean, that's how I can work as many hours. I worked
[1:26:23.320 --> 1:26:26.600]  18 hours yesterday, by the way. I'm proud of that. I'm gonna work 18 hours a day. I'll
[1:26:26.600 --> 1:26:31.520]  get off work at 4 a.m. today. I'm gonna be on coast to coast a.m. because you're only
[1:26:31.520 --> 1:26:37.960]  alive once. So son, put your foot down on the pedal. Never mind them breaks because
[1:26:37.960 --> 1:26:42.320]  we got a run to make. Now I'm gonna be very clear here with you and we've had medical
[1:26:42.320 --> 1:26:47.040]  doctors on. You do not want to go off those drugs called Turkey. And when you try to get
[1:26:47.040 --> 1:26:51.120]  smaller pills, you know, smaller increments of the drug, they're gonna say, why? Why do
[1:26:51.120 --> 1:26:55.320]  you want to go off this? Who told you that? You want to, I'm not gonna practice medicine
[1:26:55.320 --> 1:26:59.480]  here. I'm gonna tell you to go research what medical doctors have said. You need to titrate
[1:26:59.480 --> 1:27:04.720]  the dose downwards. You need to bring it down over, I'd say, a two month period. And I would
[1:27:04.720 --> 1:27:11.040]  also have a regimen of not watching as much TV or playing video games, getting healthy
[1:27:11.040 --> 1:27:17.160]  at the same time and exercising and going out and looking at the stars at night. And
[1:27:17.160 --> 1:27:22.400]  I would at the same time, what helps people pull themselves up is you need to volunteer
[1:27:22.400 --> 1:27:28.440]  at local soup kitchens and see people who are starving or people that are drunks are
[1:27:28.440 --> 1:27:33.840]  on drugs and see people with diarrhea running down their legs. That will raise your soul
[1:27:33.840 --> 1:27:37.960]  by helping them and it'll let you know how blessed you are and how good you've got it.
[1:27:37.960 --> 1:27:45.560]  And then you won't be depressed because by helping others, you are fulfilled. Okay. Now,
[1:27:45.560 --> 1:27:49.640]  that's what you can do. The drug you're on, that entire class attacks the brain, it's
[1:27:49.640 --> 1:27:56.200]  highly toxic. It has damaged your serotonin receptors. It has changed your brain chemistry.
[1:27:56.200 --> 1:28:01.200]  But that's okay. You can, you know, get it back. There's still receptors that are left.
[1:28:01.200 --> 1:28:05.480]  But the road you're going down is a very dangerous one. Do you have any comments?
[1:28:05.480 --> 1:28:10.400]  Yeah, I just want to thank you for informing me on that. It might have been the last two
[1:28:10.400 --> 1:28:16.040]  weeks. I did hear you say one comment in passing to one of your guests. It was that these SSRIs
[1:28:16.040 --> 1:28:19.320]  eat holes in the brain. They actually eat actual holes.
[1:28:19.320 --> 1:28:24.600]  Well, I mean, what do you think it is when brain cells die? What do you think it is when
[1:28:24.600 --> 1:28:29.800]  toxins go in? I mean, that's why you get senile. The brain starts dying at age 30. You start
[1:28:29.800 --> 1:28:36.200]  losing over a million brain cells a day. And yes, they are highly, I have had brain surgeons,
[1:28:36.200 --> 1:28:40.400]  urologists on who have said it attacks and kills brain cells.
[1:28:40.400 --> 1:28:48.400]  Thank God, I'm getting off early then. Now, no, sir, sir, sir. I guess you see a psychologist
[1:28:48.400 --> 1:28:55.760]  to continue them giving you the drugs. Yes. Okay. I've actually tried to discuss a little
[1:28:55.760 --> 1:29:00.360]  bit about the New World Order with him. He says it doesn't exist your mentally ill. Yes.
[1:29:00.360 --> 1:29:04.760]  Yes. And that's why I knew that basically I did not listen to these people anymore.
[1:29:04.760 --> 1:29:09.320]  And if you bring the world, but CC, this is about their not all psychologists, but most
[1:29:09.320 --> 1:29:14.600]  of them, this is about their a priest class. This is about their power trip over you. And
[1:29:14.600 --> 1:29:19.560]  you could bring them the Wall Street Journal, the Associated Press Reuters. You could bring
[1:29:19.560 --> 1:29:24.200]  them the, you know, the financial times of London saying world governments being shut
[1:29:24.200 --> 1:29:29.840]  up, he will then probably try to have you committed because that that that is a threat.
[1:29:29.840 --> 1:29:36.680]  How dare you say I'm wrong? It doesn't exist. So James, I, I, I wouldn't act all freaked
[1:29:36.680 --> 1:29:41.080]  out with him. I wouldn't get into any big rigmarole to say, Oh, I'm changing psychologist.
[1:29:41.080 --> 1:29:45.480]  And then I would get out of there. And then I would just decide you're good. You don't
[1:29:45.480 --> 1:29:51.200]  have problems. You're God's beautiful creature. And find out a regimen to get off the drugs.
[1:29:51.200 --> 1:30:01.200]  Here on the March, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:30:01.200 --> 1:30:05.480]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power? If so, this is
[1:30:05.480 --> 1:30:09.640]  going to be the most important message you will ever hear. Solar powered generators are

[1:30:19.520 --> 1:30:24.360]  Like gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes and produces electricity
[1:30:24.360 --> 1:30:28.880]  for free. It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home. Run
[1:30:28.880 --> 1:30:34.120]  some pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling. Whether it's
[1:30:34.120 --> 1:30:38.240]  hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful
[1:30:38.240 --> 1:30:42.880]  power outages again. When the power goes out, you'll be ready with a solar powered generator

[1:31:01.280 --> 1:31:06.560]  The day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[1:31:06.560 --> 1:31:11.880]  against this country. The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[1:31:11.880 --> 1:31:16.160]  Bin Laden. This is his ammo. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to the
[1:31:16.160 --> 1:31:20.400]  Middle East home of bin Laden. Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look
[1:31:20.400 --> 1:31:25.560]  at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States. Some U.S. investigators
[1:31:25.560 --> 1:31:31.280]  believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[1:31:31.280 --> 1:31:35.160]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:31:35.160 --> 1:31:40.440]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[1:31:40.440 --> 1:31:44.240]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and
[1:31:44.240 --> 1:31:50.680]  much, much more. Fabled Enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com, or see it in super high quality,

[1:33:00.460 --> 1:33:10.560]  Well, I'm not the kind to kiss and tell. Well, I'm not the kind to kiss and tell. But
[1:33:10.560 --> 1:33:18.720]  I've been seen with Farrah. I've never been with anything less than a dime. So fine. I've
[1:33:18.720 --> 1:33:25.960]  been on fire with Sally. Feel gone fast with a girl named Bo. But somehow they just don't
[1:33:25.960 --> 1:33:36.280]  end up as mine. It's a death-defying life I lead. I take my chances. I dive for a living
[1:33:36.280 --> 1:33:46.080]  in the movies and TV. But the hardest thing I ever do is watch my leading ladies kiss
[1:33:46.080 --> 1:33:54.360]  some other guy while I'm bandaging my knee. I might fall from a tall building. I might
[1:33:54.360 --> 1:34:03.320]  roll a brand new call. Calls I'm the unknown stuntman. They made Redford such a star.
[1:34:03.320 --> 1:34:07.840]  We are back live. Thank you so much for joining us today.
[1:34:07.840 --> 1:34:11.440]  I've never spent much time.
[1:34:11.440 --> 1:34:15.640]  Let's go ahead and go back to your phone calls. We have a guest coming up in about
[1:34:15.640 --> 1:34:21.140]  25 minutes and some audio clips. I want to play as well. I will be on Coast to Coast
[1:34:21.140 --> 1:34:26.880]  AM for three hours tonight with a very important transmission. The 16 million people. Hopefully
[1:34:26.880 --> 1:34:30.880]  we can get some bushfires lit. Folks know more about the states that are rebelling against
[1:34:30.880 --> 1:34:37.280]  the feds. We'll be covering that in the next hour as well. Oh, don't forget before I get
[1:34:37.280 --> 1:34:45.280]  too far into this show. Already an hour and 34 minutes, 41 seconds in. The Obama deception
[1:34:45.280 --> 1:34:49.000]  is nearing its completion. It will be done in a week and a half. Then I've got to have
[1:34:49.000 --> 1:34:57.280]  it mass produced. It will ship out on the 15th of March 2009. It will also be available
[1:34:57.280 --> 1:35:07.600]  on the 15th of March 2009 or Sunday evening to be precise at prisonplanet.tv for prisonplanet.tv
[1:35:07.600 --> 1:35:13.160]  members in super high quality and downloaded or watch it streamed via flashers, four different
[1:35:13.160 --> 1:35:19.760]  formats. And this film needs to go supernova to expose that Obama is a front man to bring
[1:35:19.760 --> 1:35:23.600]  in the final new world order banking system over the United States and the world. That's
[1:35:23.600 --> 1:35:26.680]  what they're calling a president of the world. Kissinger admits they wanted to bring in the
[1:35:26.680 --> 1:35:34.120]  new world order. It is happening. So I would invite everyone to preorder the Obama deception
[1:35:34.120 --> 1:35:39.160]  now and as the orders come in an order that is the order they will be shipped out. So
[1:35:39.160 --> 1:35:44.840]  preorder if you want the Obama deception first with your hard copy DVD and the highest quality
[1:35:44.840 --> 1:36:00.640]  at infowars.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139-888-2533139. You can also write to me at 3001 South
[1:36:00.640 --> 1:36:09.560]  Lamar sweet 100 Austin, Texas 787-04. The film is 1995. You can get them for 995 when
[1:36:09.560 --> 1:36:13.840]  you get multiple copies, but I don't care. Buy one copy and make copies of that and get
[1:36:13.840 --> 1:36:19.360]  it out to people. I want this film to go viral like no film I've ever made before. And we've
[1:36:19.360 --> 1:36:24.640]  made quite a few that have earned the record books as the most viral videos out there.
[1:36:24.640 --> 1:36:29.760]  People who don't know internet terminology go viral. That's bad. Now we mean viral. One
[1:36:29.760 --> 1:36:34.680]  virus goes into a cell. Programs that it bust open a million viruses spell out. That's what
[1:36:34.680 --> 1:36:40.200]  viral means. We make a film and within a day of releasing it on the web it goes bonkers
[1:36:40.200 --> 1:36:46.360]  everywhere. And believe me this film is hardcore. And I am putting a lot of my essence into
[1:36:46.360 --> 1:36:52.240]  it working the hardest I ever have to rush it out but at the same time to make sure it's
[1:36:52.240 --> 1:36:58.320]  my best work today. Because we don't have time to screw around and take six months to
[1:36:58.320 --> 1:37:04.080]  make a film. I'm making it more like three. I decided to make it about five months ago.
[1:37:04.080 --> 1:37:10.320]  Four months ago. But we've been doing the research. We've been hammering tongs in there
[1:37:10.320 --> 1:37:16.800]  getting it done. Like blacksmiths in the forge of liberty. A hot flame blasting up out of
[1:37:16.800 --> 1:37:22.800]  the white hot coals. And we are forging a great weapon in the infill war in a plunge
[1:37:22.800 --> 1:37:28.840]  into the heart of the new world order system. Let's talk to Randy in Michigan. Randy you're
[1:37:28.840 --> 1:37:34.040]  on the air. Hey Alex. I just wanted to talk about the internet. Two topics. But first
[1:37:34.040 --> 1:37:39.520]  I wanted to comment also on the previous caller James that you just had. I agree totally with
[1:37:39.520 --> 1:37:46.000]  what you said to him. I have been on Zoloft which is the generic searcher lane for well
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:50.200]  quite a few years and I finally wanted to come off of it. Just after hearing what the
[1:37:50.200 --> 1:37:54.360]  doctors say and they did say exactly what you described. Like why do you want to lessen
[1:37:54.360 --> 1:37:59.360]  your dosage. I mean you could take the pills in half you know. And I was like well I want
[1:37:59.360 --> 1:38:02.280]  to get off and how do I do it. And they said well you got to wean yourself off. You got
[1:38:02.280 --> 1:38:06.120]  to you know take a half pill for two weeks. It takes about four weeks both ways you know
[1:38:06.120 --> 1:38:13.400]  to go on the pill or go off it. A lot of the. And again those are psychologists. I talk
[1:38:13.400 --> 1:38:21.040]  to neurologist and medical doctors. And they say two months. But I'm not going to give
[1:38:21.040 --> 1:38:25.760]  medical advice. I'm saying I would come off of it. This is what the experts say. But do
[1:38:25.760 --> 1:38:30.200]  not believe me. Go check it out for yourself. Right. And I was nervous just coming out like
[1:38:30.200 --> 1:38:34.960]  I got a little anxious coming on the show. So I'm just going to help it. And I'm also
[1:38:34.960 --> 1:38:39.800]  I'm a member of Comcast or Comcast I'm sorry. Oops Freudian slip. They've you know they've
[1:38:39.800 --> 1:38:44.240]  been they've been caught numerous times throttling BitTorrent connections like even when I download
[1:38:44.240 --> 1:38:49.360]  like your films. I've downloaded on BitTorrent before I actually purchased them. And I agree
[1:38:49.360 --> 1:38:52.440]  that we're kicking the new world for his butt with the web. And I think a lot of it has
[1:38:52.440 --> 1:38:57.400]  to do with you know most of the computer users that aren't kind of geeky like me they don't
[1:38:57.400 --> 1:39:02.600]  realize it but Linux and the open source movement like the new Linux is helping do that. And
[1:39:02.600 --> 1:39:06.200]  I was wondering maybe in the future if you could have like a guest like Richard Stallman.
[1:39:06.200 --> 1:39:10.600]  He's like pretty much the great like the father of the open source movement and which is really
[1:39:10.600 --> 1:39:14.640]  taking a big bite out of Microsoft and you know that's another reason Microsoft wants
[1:39:14.640 --> 1:39:19.800]  to force everybody on Internet to show they'll control the architecture and all hail Linux
[1:39:19.800 --> 1:39:25.640]  where we're big Linux guys here right. All right. Thank you so much for the call. Randy
[1:39:25.640 --> 1:39:32.880]  John in Colorado. Go ahead. Alex I salute you and everything you stand for. I want you
[1:39:32.880 --> 1:39:37.160]  to know that I'm one of the legions out here that has your back. I appreciate it. God bless
[1:39:37.160 --> 1:39:43.040]  you. I got your back. Well thank you. Originally I was going to talk about spirituality in general
[1:39:43.040 --> 1:39:47.720]  and specifically fear but I had an idea that I thought was important. People are wondering
[1:39:47.720 --> 1:39:52.440]  how they're going to recognize their fellow awakened Patriots both now and in the coming
[1:39:52.440 --> 1:39:57.960]  weeks which are likely to get a little crazy. I realized we need a sign or a symbol to call
[1:39:57.960 --> 1:40:04.360]  our own. So here it is. Picture in your mind the P symbol. Now flip it upside down. What
[1:40:04.360 --> 1:40:14.080]  do you see? You see a teutonic rune of life. Okay. Or well I see a victory sign. I see
[1:40:14.080 --> 1:40:19.920]  a human with their arms raised in victory. Well that's why it's a life sign. The only
[1:40:19.920 --> 1:40:25.320]  problem is that's been adopted by the white supremacist. Oh. Okay. Well I didn't know
[1:40:25.320 --> 1:40:32.560]  that. If those who don't know the peace sign is the Nordic death rune or a dead tree or
[1:40:32.560 --> 1:40:40.920]  a dead person with its arms down and the rune of a cross with its arms up that is the teutonic
[1:40:40.920 --> 1:40:48.840]  life rune and so that's been adopted by the National Alliance and others. Okay. Well maybe
[1:40:48.840 --> 1:40:51.760]  that wouldn't be such a good idea. I didn't know that. I did a little bit of research
[1:40:51.760 --> 1:40:57.320]  and it seemed like the peace sign. I think our sign ought to be the colonial flag. Okay.
[1:40:57.320 --> 1:41:05.440]  The 13 stars. All right. That way people know we're for America defending against the globalist.
[1:41:05.440 --> 1:41:11.600]  All right. Well I just wanted to say that and I just want to say United we stand divided
[1:41:11.600 --> 1:41:17.600]  we're not. All right. Thank you so much. I appreciate your call and I agree with you.
[1:41:17.600 --> 1:41:25.120]  Okay. Let's go ahead now and talk to Joe in Oregon. Joe you're on the air. How you doing
[1:41:25.120 --> 1:41:30.240]  Alex. Good sir. Man I love your stuff and I can't wait for the Obama deception to come
[1:41:30.240 --> 1:41:35.480]  out and I mean you're right on. But I had a question. Have you ever heard of this group
[1:41:35.480 --> 1:41:43.720]  called the Guardian Angels. They're like I guess a security group. Yeah they started in
[1:41:43.720 --> 1:41:50.760]  New York and they're a vigilante group and they wear a little red commando berets. Yeah
[1:41:50.760 --> 1:41:55.360]  and they're on their shirts. They got the Illuminati sign with the wings. That means
[1:41:55.360 --> 1:42:02.280]  we're watching you. You know I don't know enough about them to pass judgment on them
[1:42:02.280 --> 1:42:07.440]  but I have seen videos and whoever's doing it needs to stop it. You know you know here's
[1:42:07.440 --> 1:42:13.520]  the problem. We don't control what anybody says or does on the message board until you
[1:42:13.520 --> 1:42:17.160]  know they're just saying kill black people and stuff like that. We do you know I don't
[1:42:17.160 --> 1:42:20.560]  have the personnel. I don't want to spend the time censoring to go in there but you
[1:42:20.560 --> 1:42:24.840]  know we can't have the police here at my office which has happened and they go how dare you
[1:42:24.840 --> 1:42:31.360]  not let me say you know go after the president or whatever. But somebody goes into every
[1:42:31.360 --> 1:42:38.360]  info wars and prison planted article and post in separate topics. This video of the Guardian
[1:42:38.360 --> 1:42:44.200]  Angels harassing a homeless man who they claim was smoking weed and they tackle him. They
[1:42:44.200 --> 1:42:50.560]  attack him and then call the police and say he attacked them and you know that's what's
[1:42:50.560 --> 1:42:55.560]  dangerous about anything that's vigilante is that especially if it's allied with the
[1:42:55.560 --> 1:43:01.840]  system is that it becomes abusive. But I don't know if you know all their work is that bad.
[1:43:01.840 --> 1:43:07.480]  Maybe we should have the Guardian Angels on. My whole issue is I'm tired of all discussion.
[1:43:07.480 --> 1:43:11.920]  You know I mean I mean here's an example people will post their own 9 11 truth video links
[1:43:11.920 --> 1:43:17.800]  on the the pages stuff that politically is very politically incorrect. But I'll even
[1:43:17.800 --> 1:43:22.880]  leave it. But that isn't enough. Then they go Alex the piece of filth is censoring us
[1:43:22.880 --> 1:43:27.440]  and not letting us post this and then there'll be the link to the video and I'm like you
[1:43:27.440 --> 1:43:32.320]  know that's not fair. We're leaving all this up and then they're blaming us or because
[1:43:32.320 --> 1:43:36.000]  it takes a minute or two for people's posts to go up because we're got a caching server
[1:43:36.000 --> 1:43:39.600]  because the site's so big it's multiple servers it's got to update every few minutes. It's
[1:43:39.600 --> 1:43:43.760]  not fair that we're not censoring people and then they go in there and say we're censoring
[1:43:43.760 --> 1:43:49.040]  them or they have glitches and then say we're censoring. Now we do have key words on the
[1:43:49.040 --> 1:43:57.800]  site like you know KILL Obama and that's because the Secret Service has been here twice and
[1:43:57.800 --> 1:44:03.640]  we got subpoenaed by a federal court on another issue and sometimes I'm tempted just to shut
[1:44:03.640 --> 1:44:11.000]  down the message board not the message board but the comments because you go in there you
[1:44:11.000 --> 1:44:13.800]  don't have to register with your real name or email you can do whatever you want and
[1:44:13.800 --> 1:44:18.200]  people abuse the daylights out of it and we know it's a lot of it's COINTELPRO but that's
[1:44:18.200 --> 1:44:20.400]  a side issue. Anything else?
[1:44:20.400 --> 1:44:28.400]  I did look up they got a website guardianangels.org and I don't know it's kind of creepy to me
[1:44:28.400 --> 1:44:34.080]  I think you know the whole red and black thing and the symbol on their shirts which is kind
[1:44:34.080 --> 1:44:39.480]  of weird I don't know and they've been around since I guess the 80s and what not but the
[1:44:39.480 --> 1:44:45.040]  leader of the CEO of the whole little clan or whatever is they get I mean he's all over
[1:44:45.040 --> 1:44:48.320]  they're all over YouTube and the whole and I mean they're worldwide.
[1:44:48.320 --> 1:44:52.440]  I hear you and I appreciate your call I mean all I know is people be having a discussion
[1:44:52.440 --> 1:44:56.760]  about states rights or trying to get their state to pass a tent amendment resolution
[1:44:56.760 --> 1:45:01.040]  and this guy it isn't enough for him to just post it once or twice he just every other
[1:45:01.040 --> 1:45:10.040]  post to try to take over discussion and it's abusive but then if I take the URL he keeps
[1:45:10.040 --> 1:45:15.160]  putting in and ban that then it takes the computer system time to look at that word
[1:45:15.160 --> 1:45:20.680]  and then it slows it down then it bans things it shouldn't be so say lobby you know that's
[1:45:20.680 --> 1:45:25.120]  the nature of freedom it's about the most open website you'll find anywhere info wars.com
[1:45:25.120 --> 1:45:29.880]  or prismplotter.com and so for being the most of it we didn't get accused of being censors.
[1:45:29.880 --> 1:45:33.680]  Speaking of that I want to go ahead and start playing this clip and then stop it and start
[1:45:33.680 --> 1:45:36.200]  it and analyze it.
[1:45:36.200 --> 1:45:43.720]  I had the print out here in my stack I wanted to be able to plug the name of the video.
[1:45:43.720 --> 1:45:51.320]  John what's the name of that YouTube video with the Christian guy no no no no no no not
[1:45:51.320 --> 1:45:59.560]  the not the guy saying I'm lying about spider goats okay the hidden trip on the new world
[1:45:59.560 --> 1:46:05.360]  order part one okay and it's a nice fella he comes off as really nice and friendly and
[1:46:05.360 --> 1:46:10.800]  seems like a good person and again this isn't about me I'm doing this because this is an
[1:46:10.800 --> 1:46:19.840]  example of the diversions and the distractions that we all end up going through when we have
[1:46:19.840 --> 1:46:29.760]  serious issues in front of us and this fellow says that I never talk about the spiritual
[1:46:29.760 --> 1:46:34.920]  nature of the new world order that Mark Dice never talks about it I mean Mark Dice's book
[1:46:34.920 --> 1:46:44.200]  that I'm holding in my hand the resistance manifesto says that it's dealing with end
[1:46:44.200 --> 1:46:52.400]  times in the antichrist and and and he was just here Friday talking about that on air
[1:46:52.400 --> 1:47:01.280]  and then this guy singles him out and says he's not talking about this now see you know
[1:47:01.280 --> 1:47:08.240]  here's the deal it's one thing to criticize us but most the criticism I see isn't based
[1:47:08.240 --> 1:47:13.840]  in reality and I saw a commenter on the YouTube video saying yeah and he won't talk about
[1:47:13.840 --> 1:47:17.920]  the corruption of the Catholic Church either I mean I had George Humphrey in here talking
[1:47:17.920 --> 1:47:22.760]  about that Friday on the show and I have text Mars on all these guests and I've always talked
[1:47:22.760 --> 1:47:29.240]  about it and then they just say no you haven't and no you're not talking about how the globalist
[1:47:29.240 --> 1:47:35.240]  are a cultist that's I made films about it but see this is what the Christian church
[1:47:35.240 --> 1:47:40.160]  does there's thousands of the nominations they all fight with each other endlessly they
[1:47:40.160 --> 1:47:44.640]  all say that you're not covering the right biblical or scriptural perspective or you're
[1:47:44.640 --> 1:47:51.720]  not it's like a bunch of Pharisees and see this is a news broadcast I cover the FEMA
[1:47:51.720 --> 1:47:59.840]  camps I cover the mercury in 50% of the corn syrup I cover you know hundreds and hundreds
[1:47:59.840 --> 1:48:04.880]  of issues we bring forward constant solutions of ways to stop or fight the new world order
[1:48:04.880 --> 1:48:13.480]  like the states rights issue and all these different Christian denominations get mad
[1:48:13.480 --> 1:48:18.240]  at me because I won't sign on to their particular brand of Christianity and just make this a
[1:48:18.240 --> 1:48:25.200]  Bible show well I'm sorry that the Bible shows I see are basically all establishment politically
[1:48:25.200 --> 1:48:30.480]  correct not covering any big issues or real issues most of them are on the government
[1:48:30.480 --> 1:48:40.200]  payroll that's on record and this is a news and analysis show this is not about left wing
[1:48:40.200 --> 1:48:46.840]  or right wing this is not about being a member of any group I am my own person and then I
[1:48:46.840 --> 1:48:52.000]  see this criticism against myself and others and this is only a microcosm there's a lot
[1:48:52.000 --> 1:48:57.440]  of this saying Alex never gives solutions when that's all we do is give solutions you
[1:48:57.440 --> 1:49:02.440]  know get healthy get off Prozac get off Ridlin get out of the public school system take control
[1:49:02.440 --> 1:49:07.440]  of your local states lobby for more second amendment lobby for national sovereignty say
[1:49:07.440 --> 1:49:13.320]  no to RFID products boycott them so they can't fully put them into place I mean all we do
[1:49:13.320 --> 1:49:17.840]  is say fight internet to here's how they're attacking the web warn people you know that's
[1:49:17.840 --> 1:49:24.080]  all we do and they say no you don't give solutions but the people that are always saying we don't
[1:49:24.080 --> 1:49:28.120]  give solutions they're the ones that just talk trash about other patriots all day I
[1:49:28.120 --> 1:49:34.200]  don't have time to be the patriot police and sit here and do this I am trying to just get
[1:49:34.200 --> 1:49:38.320]  to as many people as I can to give you the information to tell you check it out for yourself
[1:49:38.320 --> 1:49:42.440]  and then come up with a plan yourself of what you're going to do to take action against
[1:49:42.440 --> 1:49:51.080]  it because I know the decentralized program of fighting the new world order is the best
[1:49:51.080 --> 1:49:57.680]  I know that having everybody doing their own thing in their own area is pure force multiplication
[1:49:57.680 --> 1:50:02.080]  in the info war and cannot be stopped the number one thing is wake up more people because
[1:50:02.080 --> 1:50:05.400]  if people are awake to this new world order and what's happening and how the bailout was
[1:50:05.400 --> 1:50:10.440]  staged and how it's a takeover and now we have all the admissions by government then
[1:50:10.440 --> 1:50:15.720]  it will be so politically unpopular they're not going to be able to get away with it instead
[1:50:15.720 --> 1:50:19.800]  I'd say about half the people on websites and YouTube and on these video things they
[1:50:19.800 --> 1:50:25.640]  just sit around policing each other or obsessing over it's just this group and we're going
[1:50:25.640 --> 1:50:29.160]  to obsess on this group and we're going to exaggerate the power of this group and we're
[1:50:29.160 --> 1:50:37.880]  going to blah blah blah when meanwhile meanwhile the entire economy is being imploded the new
[1:50:37.880 --> 1:50:43.440]  world order is coming into play and people are arguing and debating over who's got the
[1:50:43.440 --> 1:50:48.360]  best info or who the best talk show host is or who's got the best website and obviously
[1:50:48.360 --> 1:50:54.520]  I'm the big kahuna and all this so the most of them are just jealous and upset with me
[1:50:54.520 --> 1:50:58.880]  and I just feel sorry for him because this is too dangerous of a world to be stuck on
[1:50:58.880 --> 1:51:05.040]  jealousy folks this year many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut
[1:51:05.040 --> 1:51:10.680]  back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future in these troubled times
[1:51:10.680 --> 1:51:14.960]  one of the most important things your family can have is good health some of the contributors
[1:51:14.960 --> 1:51:21.040]  to poor health are parasites viruses toxins and heavy metals it's a documented fact 80%

[1:51:26.320 --> 1:51:31.720]  parasitic infection now you can fight internal parasites heavy metals and high cholesterol

[1:52:01.680 --> 1:52:07.960]  on September 11th, 2001 along with hundreds of my fellow troops I went to grounds here
[1:52:07.960 --> 1:52:10.920]  on and we knew what to do or at least we thought we did.
[1:52:10.920 --> 1:52:16.160]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform
[1:52:16.160 --> 1:52:17.680]  to tell their story.
[1:52:17.680 --> 1:52:26.760]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[1:52:26.760 --> 1:52:31.520]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world
[1:52:31.520 --> 1:52:33.680]  take action against their global masters.
[1:52:33.680 --> 1:52:37.800]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown he takes his hand off
[1:52:37.800 --> 1:52:42.800]  and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

[1:37:43.220 --> 1:54:31.920]  that regardless of whether you're a Christian or not you don't want to be part
[1:54:31.920 --> 1:54:34.880]  of this new world order and this dehumanizing system.
[1:54:34.880 --> 1:54:35.880]  Let's go ahead and start the clip.
[1:54:35.880 --> 1:54:44.240]  Those of you in the truth movement you know what I'm talking about and due to the limitations
[1:54:44.240 --> 1:54:47.680]  of my space 10 minutes I'm not going to get into much detail but what I wanted to get
[1:54:47.680 --> 1:54:50.360]  across was this.
[1:54:50.360 --> 1:54:59.600]  Those of you who believe in the 9-11 is an inside job, I consider myself a truer.
[1:54:59.600 --> 1:55:05.360]  Believe 7 basic tenets about this new world order that's coming.
[1:55:05.360 --> 1:55:10.880]  And I kind of run them down and they are one, a global government, a one world government.
[1:55:10.880 --> 1:55:16.760]  The world under the control of one organization or one dominant group of elite people who
[1:55:16.760 --> 1:55:23.280]  want to control the world, a global currency means no more dollars, pesos, euros, it's
[1:55:23.280 --> 1:55:26.160]  going to be whatever it tends to be.
[1:55:26.160 --> 1:55:33.200]  DebtCrisis credits probably used to be electronically under some name we don't know what yet.
[1:55:33.200 --> 1:55:38.000]  A government sponsored religion that could be one religion or ten but they'll be under
[1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:43.920]  the umbrella of the government under government control and government guidelines and mandates
[1:55:43.920 --> 1:55:52.720]  and eventually those become one period that will serve the leader of the one world government.
[1:55:52.720 --> 1:55:58.640]  Number four, a mark without which you may not buy or sell, a digital currency, some kind
[1:55:58.640 --> 1:56:03.360]  of mark aligning yourself with the government that makes you a citizen, you know, world
[1:56:03.360 --> 1:56:06.120]  ID, all these good things.
[1:56:06.120 --> 1:56:11.120]  Without it you can't participate in the global economy, I mean you can't buy food, you can't
[1:56:11.120 --> 1:56:16.960]  buy a car, you can't get tags for your car, you can't go to the doctor, you can't buy
[1:56:16.960 --> 1:56:25.760]  guns and ammo, you can't do anything, you're locked out, you're pretty much your mess.
[1:56:25.760 --> 1:56:31.840]  A world leader, a world dictator, a tyrant that's going to rise up, control the world
[1:56:31.840 --> 1:56:37.000]  with my iron fist, population control, I've heard a lot about this from Alex Jones and
[1:56:37.000 --> 1:56:44.360]  Company, he believes they're trying to eliminate the population, they're down to a manageable
[1:56:44.360 --> 1:56:50.760]  number, some say about 500 million, that's what's on the Georgia guide stones, they still
[1:56:50.760 --> 1:56:54.520]  have their work reviews to get their work done but they can control you easily and keep
[1:56:54.520 --> 1:57:01.520]  their eyes on everybody but they believe this population control will come about by human
[1:57:01.520 --> 1:57:09.440]  crafted diseases, superbugs, like SARS, a little genetic engineering, bird flu, all
[1:57:09.440 --> 1:57:17.960]  this stuff, starvation purposely and woefully, causing crops to fail by various means, one
[1:57:17.960 --> 1:57:23.480]  of them which is the seventh tenant which is weather control, earthquake generators,
[1:57:23.480 --> 1:57:33.800]  contrails, spreading the disease, some say they can control the path of hurricanes, etc.
[1:57:33.800 --> 1:57:40.440]  Here's my problem, these seven tenants, they're agreed on by most all troopers, everybody
[1:57:40.440 --> 1:57:46.160]  believes 9-11's a densely job, believes in the lunar, he believes in world bankers, elite
[1:57:46.160 --> 1:57:51.160]  group of world bankers, turning things their way to their agenda, utopians and so on.
[1:57:51.160 --> 1:57:55.960]  We'll come back in the next five minutes for our guest joins us and finish up with this,
[1:57:55.960 --> 1:57:59.760]  we don't believe in the world bankers, it's documented in public, we don't believe in
[1:57:59.760 --> 1:58:03.560]  the FEMA camps, it's documented and admitted, the Associated Press, you know interviewed
[1:58:03.560 --> 1:58:07.360]  Ben Levison after we did, the father of weather weapons, they were controlling and creating
[1:58:07.360 --> 1:58:12.800]  hurricanes in 1967, Stanford Research Institute certified, see this is a show where we cover
[1:58:12.800 --> 1:58:20.840]  the news and he comes back with his problem with us and we're going to play that when
[1:58:20.840 --> 1:58:21.840]  we come back.
[1:58:21.840 --> 1:58:27.760]  And I mean the issue is that number one what he's saying about us isn't true, but regardless
[1:58:27.760 --> 1:58:32.920]  we need to focus on waking as many people up to the new order system and then that will
[1:58:32.920 --> 1:58:38.600]  lead them down the path of learning more, but it's just all this policing that goes
[1:58:38.600 --> 1:58:51.080]  on.
[1:58:51.080 --> 1:58:54.760]  Hello friends this is Alex Jones, I've told you for a long time it's important to be
[1:58:54.760 --> 1:58:59.040]  self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever, we need to be independent and food
[1:58:59.040 --> 1:59:02.680]  and water is the key, you'll never have to stand in a bread line until you have your
[1:59:02.680 --> 1:59:06.520]  own bread, you'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of

[2:00:18.800 --> 2:00:23.720]  Live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:23.720 --> 2:00:28.120]  So they're setting up a world government with a casual society, control grid, world armies,
[2:00:28.120 --> 2:00:35.000]  world court, world religion, it's all there and we've said many times you can debate why
[2:00:35.000 --> 2:00:42.440]  it's in the Bible, you can try to debate whether the globalists really believe what they believe
[2:00:42.440 --> 2:00:48.040]  but the fact is they are Luciferians, they do believe Lucifer is God and I've made two
[2:00:48.040 --> 2:00:52.360]  films on that subject, I carry scores of films on that subject, I've had scores of guest
[2:00:52.360 --> 2:00:57.640]  on, I mean I'm reading The Resistance Manifesto, the back cover, a dark web of evil is exposed
[2:00:57.640 --> 2:01:01.800]  like never before making biblical prophecy and the New World Order crystal clear, learn
[2:01:01.800 --> 2:01:05.680]  the most powerful information about the Illuminati, plans for the rise of the Antichrist, the
[2:01:05.680 --> 2:01:10.040]  institutions, people and powers involved and how you confide them.
[2:01:10.040 --> 2:01:14.800]  Now Mark Dice's whole website is about that, his book is about that, we sell it, we had
[2:01:14.800 --> 2:01:20.440]  him on last week talking about it, but it didn't matter, if I made my whole show say
[2:01:20.440 --> 2:01:26.120]  a Baptist show, then a million other Christian sects would be mad at us, this is a radio
[2:01:26.120 --> 2:01:31.160]  show, yes the world leaders believe this, yes they're pushing this, we secularly lay
[2:01:31.160 --> 2:01:36.040]  out the facts and say now make your own decision and that has caused so many people to wake
[2:01:36.040 --> 2:01:43.760]  up who would never wake up to some aggressive preacher pushing things on them, okay.
[2:01:43.760 --> 2:01:47.040]  Now a lot of the people that researched this think it was all planted in the Bible by the
[2:01:47.040 --> 2:01:51.040]  New World Order to prepare us for this, I don't believe that but what I do know is most churches
[2:01:51.040 --> 2:01:55.940]  say rejoice it's the end, rejoice we're about to be teleported out of here with the made
[2:01:55.940 --> 2:02:00.680]  up rapture, the pre-trib rapture, see I don't get into all that, I'm covering the news so
[2:02:00.680 --> 2:02:04.720]  people can make their decisions about what's happening in the world, now let's have this
[2:02:04.720 --> 2:02:10.480]  guy with his false accusations against us, here it is, turning things their way to their
[2:02:10.480 --> 2:02:19.280]  agenda, utopian society, all kind of agree with those seven tenets, now here's the disconnect
[2:02:19.280 --> 2:02:28.120]  I have, nowhere in these seven tenets are nowhere in Alex Jones' speech or Jason Burman's
[2:02:28.120 --> 2:02:33.120]  speech or Mark Dice's speech that I could find in any of this truth movement, can I
[2:02:33.120 --> 2:02:40.200]  find God anywhere, hit pause, I mean I get this every day, you never talk about Israel
[2:02:40.200 --> 2:02:45.200]  and it's corruption, I made multiple films about it, hundreds of Gaston, they say I don't,
[2:02:45.200 --> 2:02:47.960]  nowhere do we criticize the corruption of the Catholic Church and the Pope calling for
[2:02:47.960 --> 2:02:52.600]  world government, total lies, you know and I'm not talking about this guy, it's other
[2:02:52.600 --> 2:02:59.840]  people, see I mean this is intellectual laziness at best, I mean Mark Dice's whole work is
[2:02:59.840 --> 2:03:06.600]  about that, he was on here last Friday talking about it and again I'm not bullied into covering
[2:03:06.600 --> 2:03:11.160]  anything here, in fact this makes me not want to cover it as much, you know I lost a radio
[2:03:11.160 --> 2:03:16.200]  station last week for speaking out against abortion, maybe you guys out there could spend
[2:03:16.200 --> 2:03:20.760]  more time fighting abortion and more time actually saving people and more time warning
[2:03:20.760 --> 2:03:26.040]  people, instead most Christians spend their time bossing everybody around, let's finish
[2:03:26.040 --> 2:03:31.040]  up with it, and that's the funny thing because if you take these seven sentences, these seven
[2:03:31.040 --> 2:03:37.960]  things that we all agreed on pretty much, I've seen it in the New World Order truth
[2:03:37.960 --> 2:03:44.560]  movement, I11 inside job thing, they'll agree with this, that these seven things are happening,
[2:03:44.560 --> 2:03:49.480]  there's evidence of it, you can be found, if you look, a preponderance of the evidence
[2:03:49.480 --> 2:03:56.240]  system, this is coming, a New World Order is definitely coming, it's been documented
[2:03:56.240 --> 2:04:02.320]  and world leaders, presidents, ambassadors, journalists, they've all come out and said
[2:04:02.320 --> 2:04:05.640]  it with their mouth from time to time, they've been caught on film, we've seen the clips,
[2:04:05.640 --> 2:04:11.640]  most of you that are studying the truth, but nobody mentions God, okay that's enough,
[2:04:11.640 --> 2:04:17.640]  you can watch the rest of the clip if you want, the point is, is that that's not true,
[2:04:17.640 --> 2:04:24.120]  and you know, we're just here trying to warn the largest amount of people we can, you know,
[2:04:24.120 --> 2:04:28.120]  we get on air and say the world leaders worship Lucifer, here's all this documentation, here's
[2:04:28.120 --> 2:04:34.040]  all this info, and now it's up to you to decide why are they doing this, why are supposed
[2:04:34.040 --> 2:04:38.200]  that atheist leaders telling you God doesn't exist, but then they secretly are into the
[2:04:38.200 --> 2:04:43.680]  occult, why don't they want you knowing about this, and that's all we do, and then I have
[2:04:43.680 --> 2:04:50.960]  to answer constant charges like this, we need people, and folks want to feel special, they
[2:04:50.960 --> 2:04:54.840]  want to brand themselves, you know, oh I'm the only one giving of the truth, now there's
[2:04:54.840 --> 2:04:58.480]  a lot of people getting the word out doing a great job, let's all work together against
[2:04:58.480 --> 2:05:01.360]  the globalist.
[2:05:01.360 --> 2:05:05.320]  Phase one of the insiders plan for a one world government has been initiated with the recent
[2:05:05.320 --> 2:05:10.360]  bailout, international bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create
[2:05:10.360 --> 2:05:15.280]  a new currency and a new world bank to act as saviour, but we've only seen the beginning,
[2:05:15.280 --> 2:05:19.960]  their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times, shortages
[2:05:19.960 --> 2:05:24.360]  and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land, the insiders have discovered
[2:05:24.360 --> 2:05:29.720]  that they must control two things to cease total power, phase one is a one world currency
[2:05:29.720 --> 2:05:34.320]  which we are currently being prepared to accept, phase two of their insidious plan is complete
[2:05:34.320 --> 2:05:44.320]  control of our food supplies, go to www.foodshortageusa.com for the details, that's www.foodshortageusa.com

[2:06:05.800 --> 2:06:11.520]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government, it's known as
[2:06:11.520 --> 2:06:16.360]  the Builder Bird, don't their objective be world domination?
[2:06:16.360 --> 2:06:21.760]  For thousands of years their dark order grew, now as they hail the birth of the new world
[2:06:21.760 --> 2:06:30.600]  order their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand, for the first time

[2:07:14.040 --> 2:07:18.440]  that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green
[2:07:18.440 --> 2:07:22.920]  earth, perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[2:07:22.920 --> 2:07:27.560]  The cost of learning is minimal, wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere,
[2:07:27.560 --> 2:07:31.080]  it's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.

[2:08:20.880 --> 2:08:27.880]  Not just Christians, but Hindus, Muslims, other people.
[2:08:27.880 --> 2:08:31.800]  The leaders of their denominations have been funded openly by governments and corporations
[2:08:31.800 --> 2:08:36.400]  to preach doctrines of submission to government, submission to tyranny.
[2:08:36.400 --> 2:08:39.120]  Christians in the last 150 years have been taught they're not to fight evil, they're
[2:08:39.120 --> 2:08:43.480]  to lay down to corruption, when all the major prophets were killed or tortured or imprisoned
[2:08:43.480 --> 2:08:47.080]  and Christ himself was killed.
[2:08:47.080 --> 2:08:50.120]  They don't want you to know that it was the pastors who led the revolt against the British
[2:08:50.120 --> 2:08:55.520]  in 1776, the Black Brigade as they were known, because regardless of denomination they tend
[2:08:55.520 --> 2:09:02.040]  to wear black suits, and they want to hold up these pulpit prostitutes like Benny Hinn
[2:09:02.040 --> 2:09:07.600]  and the rest of them to make religion look bad, to make Christianity look bad, and then
[2:09:07.600 --> 2:09:12.360]  the rest of the Christian community spends most of its time in fighting with each other.
[2:09:12.360 --> 2:09:15.680]  That's why this is a news show and we cover news and information.
[2:09:15.680 --> 2:09:20.600]  It is a secular fact, see as soon as you get into religion, people out there who aren't
[2:09:20.600 --> 2:09:25.400]  Christian or who aren't, who are agnostic and don't believe in anything, you know, Einstein
[2:09:25.400 --> 2:09:30.320]  believed in God because he studied the universe, his mind could grasp it, you can see the intelligent
[2:09:30.320 --> 2:09:32.920]  design everywhere.
[2:09:32.920 --> 2:09:39.520]  But regardless of that, they want to make it a religious debate, that's why when I cover
[2:09:39.520 --> 2:09:44.000]  the occultic activities at Skull and Bones or Bohemian Grove or by the United Nations
[2:09:44.000 --> 2:09:48.520]  and Maurice Strong out in Colorado, they go, oh, I'm an atheist, I don't believe in that
[2:09:48.520 --> 2:09:49.520]  stuff.
[2:09:49.520 --> 2:09:54.520]  Okay, well as an anthropologist, as a psychologist, as someone studying society, is it a little
[2:09:54.520 --> 2:09:59.760]  unusual that we have world leaders who are involved in a Luciferian slash goddess cult
[2:09:59.760 --> 2:10:03.360]  and believe they want to bring in a one-world government to exterminate 80% of the world
[2:10:03.360 --> 2:10:05.560]  for Gaia?
[2:10:05.560 --> 2:10:08.440]  I mean, that's what they believe, that's in the United Nations biological diversity
[2:10:08.440 --> 2:10:14.960]  assessment, 89, 96, you know, the Pentagon's written stuff like the Earth First Battalion,
[2:10:14.960 --> 2:10:19.160]  that's where that term came from, in the 70s saying that they're the pale horse rider
[2:10:19.160 --> 2:10:22.080]  death and they're going to bring in world government and they're going to kill the
[2:10:22.080 --> 2:10:26.800]  majority of us and Spangler and others in CFR publications like Foreign Affairs have
[2:10:26.800 --> 2:10:30.760]  said all of us will take a Luciferian pledge before we initiate.
[2:10:30.760 --> 2:10:33.960]  Okay, you're an atheist, what do you make of that?
[2:10:33.960 --> 2:10:37.680]  You think religion's stupid, you think we're all kooks, you know, you say, oh, you believe
[2:10:37.680 --> 2:10:41.920]  in Jesus, I'll believe in the spaghetti monster or I'll believe in the Tooth Fairy or, you
[2:10:41.920 --> 2:10:45.520]  know, like Bill Hicks said, you believe in the Tooth Fairy, well, I mean, how about I'm
[2:10:45.520 --> 2:10:51.600]  saying a little elf is putting Lincoln logs in your dresser, you know, whatever.
[2:10:51.600 --> 2:10:57.320]  My whole issue is, why is it only Christians who are kooks if they believe in a creator?
[2:10:57.320 --> 2:11:01.400]  But, we all know the UN is pushing this one-world religion.
[2:11:01.400 --> 2:11:06.560]  We make films about it, we cover it, we constantly get into it.
[2:11:06.560 --> 2:11:10.320]  But I tell you, I talk to a lot of Christians and they go, oh, I know the New World Order
[2:11:10.320 --> 2:11:11.320]  is real.
[2:11:11.320 --> 2:11:12.320]  Praise God, I'll be out of here soon.
[2:11:12.320 --> 2:11:15.280]  And I'll go, well, don't you want to warn your friends and family?
[2:11:15.280 --> 2:11:16.680]  Well, that's just the way it is.
[2:11:16.680 --> 2:11:21.000]  If they don't repent, they'll go to hell, they won't be raptured.
[2:11:21.000 --> 2:11:23.520]  The Antichrist will get them.
[2:11:23.520 --> 2:11:24.520]  What a cop-out.
[2:11:24.520 --> 2:11:30.160]  People thought it was the Antichrist in Europe with Hitler, Russian Christians and Ukrainian
[2:11:30.160 --> 2:11:34.000]  Christians when Stalin and before him, Lenin were killing him, thought that it was the
[2:11:34.000 --> 2:11:37.440]  end of the world and, you know, they were going to stand down.
[2:11:37.440 --> 2:11:41.000]  The Aztecs laid down to the Conquistadors because they thought it was the end of the
[2:11:41.000 --> 2:11:42.000]  world.
[2:11:42.000 --> 2:11:44.600]  Thought they were gods.
[2:11:44.600 --> 2:11:48.960]  Some Native American tribes laid down and, you know, did a ghost dance and, you know,
[2:11:48.960 --> 2:11:51.320]  I mean, I'm not laying down to evil.
[2:11:51.320 --> 2:11:56.040]  I'm not going to take the coward's way out in my Bible, but also history and common sense
[2:11:56.040 --> 2:12:02.560]  shows that I need to stand up against tyranny and corruption and say no to evil.
[2:12:02.560 --> 2:12:06.760]  And so really, I don't want to be associated with what is known as a Christian today.
[2:12:06.760 --> 2:12:12.320]  I don't want to be associated with any of that because that isn't what's in my Bible.
[2:12:12.320 --> 2:12:16.640]  You can go off of the Romans 13 and they celebrate when the news is pushing implantable chips
[2:12:16.640 --> 2:12:19.280]  and they celebrate all this talk of war with Russia.
[2:12:19.280 --> 2:12:21.440]  Oh, we're going to be out of here soon.
[2:12:21.440 --> 2:12:26.600]  And when they're not out of here and the things that are coming, they are going to lose their
[2:12:26.600 --> 2:12:27.600]  faith.
[2:12:27.600 --> 2:12:28.600]  See, it's all a trap.
[2:12:28.600 --> 2:12:31.520]  This is very sophisticated.
[2:12:31.520 --> 2:12:34.960]  And I'll tell you, I've found, you know, I judge a tree by its fruits and I found atheists
[2:12:34.960 --> 2:12:39.000]  and agnostics by and large are very unhappy people.
[2:12:39.000 --> 2:12:42.160]  Why do they care if old people are being euthanized or children are starving to death?
[2:12:42.160 --> 2:12:47.080]  You know, we're all just animals anyways and it's all social Darwinism and, you know, humans
[2:12:47.080 --> 2:12:48.760]  are bad and we're a parasite.
[2:12:48.760 --> 2:12:51.600]  And, you know, there's not this belief that there's the divine.
[2:12:51.600 --> 2:12:53.080]  There's the outside of us.
[2:12:53.080 --> 2:12:54.680]  There's the larger universe.
[2:12:54.680 --> 2:12:59.800]  We're on a planet hurtling through space around a sun with billions of galaxies all around
[2:12:59.800 --> 2:13:04.040]  us that Hubble Space Telescope can see.
[2:13:04.040 --> 2:13:11.080]  There's so many mysteries, so many dimensions, so many things we don't know.
[2:13:11.080 --> 2:13:13.600]  But if they can get you to decide, I'm just like a bacteria.
[2:13:13.600 --> 2:13:15.000]  I'm just like a mold.
[2:13:15.000 --> 2:13:16.000]  I'm nothing.
[2:13:16.000 --> 2:13:17.000]  I'm not special.
[2:13:17.000 --> 2:13:20.740]  Then the establishment can say, oh, but the animals are, we're going to represent the
[2:13:20.740 --> 2:13:22.320]  animals and they're going to outvote you.
[2:13:22.320 --> 2:13:24.480]  So you're going to lose your property rights now.
[2:13:24.480 --> 2:13:27.120]  It's all about control.
[2:13:27.120 --> 2:13:36.400]  So perhaps I should have some pastors on that I do respect to go over Romans 13 and go over
[2:13:36.400 --> 2:13:40.120]  what's happened to our churches and what they've turned into.
[2:13:40.120 --> 2:13:45.160]  But regardless, I come at this with the news and the information and it's a million times
[2:13:45.160 --> 2:13:48.960]  more successful than some preacher on the street corner screaming at people who are
[2:13:48.960 --> 2:13:50.080]  drunk coming out of bars.
[2:13:50.080 --> 2:13:51.160]  They just laugh at them.
[2:13:51.160 --> 2:13:55.320]  Now, I'm not saying going out on the street for anything political or religious is bad.
[2:13:55.320 --> 2:13:56.600]  That's a great thing.
[2:13:56.600 --> 2:13:57.680]  But you see the way they do it.
[2:13:57.680 --> 2:13:58.680]  It turns people off.
[2:13:58.680 --> 2:14:01.040]  You need to reach out to them.
[2:14:01.040 --> 2:14:05.240]  We're in a lot of trouble as a society.
[2:14:05.240 --> 2:14:11.640]  Now, on another issue of solutions, all we offer here on this radio show is solutions.
[2:14:11.640 --> 2:14:14.320]  If you listen to every hour of the show, what's the big solution?
[2:14:14.320 --> 2:14:15.840]  Waking people up, reaching out.
[2:14:15.840 --> 2:14:18.760]  So people understand the political minefield they're in.
[2:14:18.760 --> 2:14:20.680]  So they understand the society they're in.
[2:14:20.680 --> 2:14:23.440]  So they know the people perish for lack of knowledge.
[2:14:23.440 --> 2:14:26.520]  So they know offshore banks are setting up a world government.
[2:14:26.520 --> 2:14:30.480]  So they know they're setting up a global central bank to control our nation with carbon taxes
[2:14:30.480 --> 2:14:33.240]  to regulate every facet of our lives.
[2:14:33.240 --> 2:14:39.080]  So they know that the entire Northcom system is built around blocking the states from resisting
[2:14:39.080 --> 2:14:42.960]  a federal takeover.
[2:14:42.960 --> 2:14:44.760]  That's a huge solution.
[2:14:44.760 --> 2:14:49.440]  Learning about what the gun bills are and raising a hue and cry, raising the alarm.
[2:14:49.440 --> 2:14:51.120]  That is the key.
[2:14:51.120 --> 2:14:54.320]  And then once you have a cadre of educated people, which we have, getting you to go
[2:14:54.320 --> 2:14:59.680]  about and educate others and educate them that action is needed.
[2:14:59.680 --> 2:15:04.680]  Take what we've done just in the last month and in a few days, beating the drum of states'
[2:15:04.680 --> 2:15:06.680]  rights to this federal takeover.
[2:15:06.680 --> 2:15:07.680]  The outrage is there.
[2:15:07.680 --> 2:15:08.680]  The public's waking up.
[2:15:08.680 --> 2:15:10.120]  Now we need to take the states over.
[2:15:10.120 --> 2:15:12.520]  We need to remove the electronic voting machines.
[2:15:12.520 --> 2:15:16.720]  First we've got to discredit the electronic voting machines and educate folks.
[2:15:16.720 --> 2:15:17.720]  They're a fraud.
[2:15:17.720 --> 2:15:20.200]  You know, there's all, it all first comes with knowledge.
[2:15:20.200 --> 2:15:23.520]  It's like if your engine's blown and you want to go fix the engine, but you don't
[2:15:23.520 --> 2:15:29.680]  know how to fix it, you've got to learn how to fix the engine first.
[2:15:29.680 --> 2:15:33.040]  And so this is the crossroads we're at.
[2:15:33.040 --> 2:15:37.240]  This is a very important time in history right now.
[2:15:37.240 --> 2:15:41.640]  And look at how I've been beating the drum for 13-plus years about the police state
[2:15:41.640 --> 2:15:47.080]  and the New World Order and the FEMA camps and the troops trying to take your guns.
[2:15:47.080 --> 2:15:48.680]  And people laughed at me and it was a big joke.
[2:15:48.680 --> 2:15:49.680]  I didn't care.
[2:15:49.680 --> 2:15:51.400]  I knew they were preparing for it.
[2:15:51.400 --> 2:15:53.640]  I have the documents, I showed them to people.
[2:15:53.640 --> 2:15:58.280]  We had the video of them training and I knew that as it unfolded, I hoped we just had more
[2:15:58.280 --> 2:16:03.120]  time to back them off so we could wake people up and we have done that now.
[2:16:03.120 --> 2:16:07.960]  And now I talk to my dad, I talk to my uncles, I talk to cousins, I talk to people all over
[2:16:07.960 --> 2:16:12.520]  the country in the world and they say, Alex, the Japanese parliament is watching your films
[2:16:12.520 --> 2:16:13.520]  and committee hearings.
[2:16:13.520 --> 2:16:16.400]  When we have Japanese parliament members on, we've woken up.
[2:16:16.400 --> 2:16:22.160]  And Alex, members of the Italian parliament are listening and Russia is listening and
[2:16:22.160 --> 2:16:26.240]  Germany is listening and leaders in our government are listening and I get generals and admirals
[2:16:26.240 --> 2:16:32.580]  calling me up, retired and colonels and special forces people and they know.
[2:16:32.580 --> 2:16:33.840]  And they're like, how did you know?
[2:16:33.840 --> 2:16:35.880]  And I'm just, I ran right into it.
[2:16:35.880 --> 2:16:36.960]  There were urban warfare drills.
[2:16:36.960 --> 2:16:37.960]  I said, what are these?
[2:16:37.960 --> 2:16:39.440]  I found out it was a takeover plan.
[2:16:39.440 --> 2:16:40.840]  I started warning people.
[2:16:40.840 --> 2:16:41.840]  So what?
[2:16:41.840 --> 2:16:42.840]  I'm trying to save people.
[2:16:42.840 --> 2:16:43.840]  I'm trying to help people.
[2:16:43.840 --> 2:16:46.640]  I'm trying to save myself, it's symbiotic.
[2:16:46.640 --> 2:16:48.960]  If I don't help others, find out the truth.
[2:16:48.960 --> 2:16:52.480]  If I don't make sure they're free, I don't have any future either.
[2:16:52.480 --> 2:16:55.200]  See, the new world order teaches you how to be selfish.
[2:16:55.200 --> 2:16:59.200]  I don't care what's happened to my neighbors and others as long as I got mine.
[2:16:59.200 --> 2:17:02.640]  But then when they don't care about you, you get enslaved as well.
[2:17:02.640 --> 2:17:07.560]  See, it's a mutual defense when we defend liberty, defend freedom, stand up against
[2:17:07.560 --> 2:17:13.760]  oppression, aren't cowed by the police state, when we analyze its architecture and expose
[2:17:13.760 --> 2:17:17.440]  it, then the people see it going into place.
[2:17:17.440 --> 2:17:21.400]  Just like we talk about internet two, five, six years ago, now it's mainstream news.
[2:17:21.400 --> 2:17:22.880]  Our credibility just went up again.
[2:17:22.880 --> 2:17:24.160]  Now people know it's true.
[2:17:24.160 --> 2:17:25.720]  They know internet two is a takeover.
[2:17:25.720 --> 2:17:26.920]  They're fighting it.
[2:17:26.920 --> 2:17:30.840]  People say, well, where's the martial law?
[2:17:30.840 --> 2:17:32.160]  Well, where's the police state, Alex?
[2:17:32.160 --> 2:17:34.840]  Well, Congress has been threatened with martial law.
[2:17:34.840 --> 2:17:38.440]  People reserve bank governors have said they're not even allowed to know what's going on.
[2:17:38.440 --> 2:17:40.600]  They're under war powers and martial law.
[2:17:40.600 --> 2:17:42.040]  North com is now in control.
[2:17:42.040 --> 2:17:44.120]  They're announcing they're going to put troops on the streets.
[2:17:44.120 --> 2:17:49.800]  That's another ratchet up in the police state, in the martial law grid, in the Richter scale.
[2:17:49.800 --> 2:17:55.880]  But because we exposed this so diligently for so long, now their rollout of this program
[2:17:55.880 --> 2:17:59.160]  isn't going to go as well.
[2:17:59.160 --> 2:18:04.920]  And the praise goes to those men and women out there who knew the truth, who checked out
[2:18:04.920 --> 2:18:09.640]  my info, who took action, who made copies of police state two, the takeover, police
[2:18:09.640 --> 2:18:13.240]  state three total enslavement, police state 2000.
[2:18:13.240 --> 2:18:17.520]  Those of you that made copies of my radio shows, those of you that did it back on cassette
[2:18:17.520 --> 2:18:21.360]  tape, you know, 12, 13 years ago, those of you that spread the word and put my films
[2:18:21.360 --> 2:18:25.080]  on access TV, those of you that did that, you are wonderful.
[2:18:25.080 --> 2:18:30.920]  And you're an example to us all of what other people need to be doing, not sitting there.
[2:18:30.920 --> 2:18:34.000]  A lot of people procrastinate, you know, I want to paint my house and I want to put
[2:18:34.000 --> 2:18:38.240]  some new eaves on it and fix the leaks, but they overanalyze for years.
[2:18:38.240 --> 2:18:39.240]  They plan it.
[2:18:39.240 --> 2:18:40.400]  They talk about it.
[2:18:40.400 --> 2:18:41.640]  Most people do this.
[2:18:41.640 --> 2:18:44.560]  We need people who are full of action.
[2:18:44.560 --> 2:18:46.640]  You know, Elvis said, a little less talk, a little more action.
[2:18:46.640 --> 2:18:47.640]  In fact, let's pull that up.
[2:18:47.640 --> 2:18:48.640]  Pull that up on YouTube.
[2:18:48.640 --> 2:18:51.440]  Elvis, a little less talk, a little more action.
[2:18:51.440 --> 2:18:56.600]  I want to play a clip of that later, a little less talk, a little more action.
[2:18:56.600 --> 2:19:05.200]  He's talking about something else with a woman, but we're using it in the connotation of resisting.
[2:19:05.200 --> 2:19:06.200]  And that's what we need.
[2:19:06.200 --> 2:19:08.220]  We need action, action, action.
[2:19:08.220 --> 2:19:09.600]  That's what this radio shows about.
[2:19:09.600 --> 2:19:13.720]  The websites, the films, the guest, a platform to bring others on.
[2:19:13.720 --> 2:19:15.200]  It's so wonderful, our platform.
[2:19:15.200 --> 2:19:17.480]  This is accelerating, getting bigger and bigger by the minute.
[2:19:17.480 --> 2:19:19.320]  That's why they're racing to shut down the web.
[2:19:19.320 --> 2:19:22.600]  And we're just one part of that, but a big part of that fight.
[2:19:22.600 --> 2:19:31.360]  And it's all of us in symbiosis, in the symbiotic relationship, together, learning more, integrating
[2:19:31.360 --> 2:19:35.440]  information, expanding, growing.
[2:19:35.440 --> 2:19:40.920]  We're going to come back and talk to somebody who for, I guess, 15-plus years has been fighting
[2:19:40.920 --> 2:19:43.360]  the New World Order, the state's rights level.
[2:19:43.360 --> 2:19:47.240]  He was an aide to one of the state reps who introduced a bill that passed in Colorado
[2:19:47.240 --> 2:19:51.040]  back in 1994 for the states to say no to the federal takeover.
[2:19:51.040 --> 2:19:52.840]  We'll talk to him when we get back.
[2:19:52.840 --> 2:19:55.120]  Folks, there's a war on.
[2:19:55.120 --> 2:19:57.120]  Are you going to sign up to fight?
[2:19:57.120 --> 2:20:03.040]  And I want to commend all those that have been fighting.
[2:20:03.040 --> 2:20:05.760]  It's a new year full of uncertainties.
[2:20:05.760 --> 2:20:08.640]  People are being laid off in record numbers.
[2:20:08.640 --> 2:20:13.600]  The price of food continues to rise and the economy continues to falter.
[2:20:13.600 --> 2:20:17.640]  You know that you need to prepare, and maybe you've been putting it off, but the time to
[2:20:17.640 --> 2:20:19.240]  act is now.
[2:20:19.240 --> 2:20:22.400]  That's why you need to visit OrganicaSeed.com.

[2:20:58.640 --> 2:21:00.640]  OrganicaSeed.com today.
[2:21:00.640 --> 2:21:06.440]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[2:21:06.440 --> 2:21:07.960]  against this country.
[2:21:07.960 --> 2:21:12.160]  The enemy struck America on September 11th, but who is the enemy?
[2:21:12.160 --> 2:21:13.160]  bin Laden.
[2:21:13.160 --> 2:21:14.160]  This is his M.O.
[2:21:14.160 --> 2:21:15.160]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[2:21:15.160 --> 2:21:17.240]  We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[2:21:17.240 --> 2:21:21.920]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[2:21:21.920 --> 2:21:24.520]  networks inside the United States.
[2:21:24.520 --> 2:21:28.400]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in
[2:21:28.400 --> 2:21:31.160]  spying in and on the U.S.
[2:21:31.160 --> 2:21:34.840]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:21:34.840 --> 2:21:40.320]  From Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[2:21:40.320 --> 2:21:44.120]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and
[2:21:44.120 --> 2:21:45.480]  much, much more.
[2:21:45.480 --> 2:21:46.480]  Fabled Enemies.

[2:22:01.240 --> 2:22:25.280]  We all want liberty, some give their lives for it, a price that cannot be taken for granted.
[2:22:25.280 --> 2:22:28.320]  We forfeit bites and pieces of our freedom for what?
[2:22:28.320 --> 2:22:33.200]  February 28, Minnesota Campaign for Liberty will host Tom Woods, bestselling author of
[2:22:33.200 --> 2:22:38.000]  The Meltdown, Professor Butler, author of Trade on the Great Depression, and Bill Butler

[2:23:30.560 --> 2:23:34.320]  Are taxes, food, energy, housing, medical, forcing Americans into poverty?
[2:23:34.320 --> 2:23:38.760]  Is free enterprise flawed or is our monetary system forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring
[2:23:38.760 --> 2:23:40.400]  inflation and higher taxes?
[2:23:40.400 --> 2:23:42.880]  The answers are in Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.

[2:25:46.200 --> 2:25:48.440]  resolution say look fed you can't be in here

[2:26:35.600 --> 2:26:36.640]  in ninety four
[2:26:36.640 --> 2:26:40.880]  that they got picked up on california now we're seeing a massive reassertion
[2:26:40.880 --> 2:26:41.880]  so this
[2:26:41.880 --> 2:26:43.680]  okay
[2:26:43.680 --> 2:26:47.720]  uh... i'm i'm turkey chop top but there's a smattering of uh... german
[2:26:47.720 --> 2:26:50.480]  french and irish in there too alexo
[2:26:50.480 --> 2:26:55.200]  and uh... uh... the name kind of stuck since i was a kid
[2:26:55.200 --> 2:26:57.400]  so you know where we go
[2:26:57.400 --> 2:27:00.320]  but uh... in nineteen ninety three
[2:27:00.320 --> 2:27:02.760]  uh... i was listening to a talk radio show
[2:27:02.760 --> 2:27:04.960]  a local show on here in uh...
[2:27:04.960 --> 2:27:06.280]  colorado
[2:27:06.280 --> 2:27:10.280]  and a little known senator named charles duke her at that time he was a
[2:27:10.280 --> 2:27:11.800]  representative
[2:27:11.800 --> 2:27:13.800]  uh... came on the air and
[2:27:13.800 --> 2:27:16.320]  was discussing a method
[2:27:16.320 --> 2:27:19.800]  for eliminating federal mandates
[2:27:19.800 --> 2:27:22.920]  which are these federal laws that come down
[2:27:22.920 --> 2:27:25.160]  and mandate the states
[2:27:25.160 --> 2:27:26.920]  to do certain things
[2:27:26.920 --> 2:27:29.040]  funded or unfunded
[2:27:29.040 --> 2:27:33.720]  and he had hit upon a tenth amendment resolution
[2:27:33.720 --> 2:27:36.120]  and i i heard this
[2:27:36.120 --> 2:27:41.640]  and growing up in colorado you know i'm a dairy farm boy uh... i i got you know
[2:27:41.640 --> 2:27:45.000]  the southern baptist religion the constitution and bill of rights along
[2:27:45.000 --> 2:27:47.480]  with my morning pancakes in the morning
[2:27:47.480 --> 2:27:49.880]  before i went to school
[2:27:49.880 --> 2:27:51.520]  i understood
[2:27:51.520 --> 2:27:55.880]  the essential truth about the constitution and that is that it is
[2:27:55.880 --> 2:27:59.320]  a contract between the states
[2:27:59.320 --> 2:28:03.320]  it is not a contract with the federal government the federal government
[2:28:03.320 --> 2:28:04.920]  was created
[2:28:04.920 --> 2:28:07.960]  by that contract that's right this is key the states
[2:28:07.960 --> 2:28:10.440]  do a deal with themselves to constitute
[2:28:10.440 --> 2:28:13.160]  the federal government in the minute it becomes destructive
[2:28:13.160 --> 2:28:17.480]  they can dissolve it exactly and that's what we're engaged in here
[2:28:17.480 --> 2:28:21.240]  and it's it's marvelous to see i i i had i had uh...
[2:28:21.240 --> 2:28:23.800]  uh... in in nineteen ninety three
[2:28:23.800 --> 2:28:28.280]  uh... i called the senator and i are the uh... representatives that
[2:28:28.280 --> 2:28:31.480]  he became a senator yes anyway i called him
[2:28:31.480 --> 2:28:32.760]  uh... on the air
[2:28:32.760 --> 2:28:36.680]  on it was november eleventh nineteen ninety three
[2:28:36.680 --> 2:28:41.240]  and i told him that i would do anything i could to help him because
[2:28:41.240 --> 2:28:43.480]  his plea for support
[2:28:43.480 --> 2:28:45.400]  is a lot like yours is

[2:28:49.000 --> 2:28:50.440]  the the the
[2:28:50.440 --> 2:28:52.040]  urgent necessity
[2:28:52.040 --> 2:28:54.840]  that people realize that we cannot
[2:28:54.840 --> 2:28:59.080]  uh... go this way alone that's right that was the first big explosion against

[2:29:06.760 --> 2:29:08.840]  uh... where they also pass similar things

[2:29:21.080 --> 2:29:23.560]  uh... patriots uh... groups

[2:36:36.360 --> 2:36:39.800]  the time frame we were just coming off of the heels
[2:36:39.800 --> 2:36:45.560]  of ruby ridge and it was obvious to most of the people in the community in the
[2:36:45.560 --> 2:36:50.280]  patriot community that uh... you know this this was a
[2:36:50.280 --> 2:36:54.760]  pretense for something bigger and then uh... you know they
[2:36:54.760 --> 2:36:58.680]  they uh... the whole thing with the world trade center
[2:36:58.680 --> 2:37:02.920]  bombing the first one that killed twelve people and injured dozens
[2:37:02.920 --> 2:37:08.520]  uh... when it failed they had something set up in the media already
[2:37:08.520 --> 2:37:12.280]  and the batf went into the church in waco
[2:37:12.280 --> 2:37:15.640]  and the fifty one day siege started which took
[2:37:15.640 --> 2:37:19.640]  everybody's eyes off of the world trade center
[2:37:19.640 --> 2:37:23.640]  now uh... you know we can do some interesting things without
[2:37:23.640 --> 2:37:27.800]  but the point is that representative duke
[2:37:27.800 --> 2:37:32.760]  uh... being from arkansas knew that uh... bill clinton
[2:37:32.760 --> 2:37:35.880]  uh... would make george bush look like a piker
[2:37:35.880 --> 2:37:41.560]  and he understood what kind of problem the country would have
[2:37:41.560 --> 2:37:46.520]  given uh... clinton's policies in arkansas all those years he was governor
[2:37:46.520 --> 2:37:49.400]  i mean he turned it into the poorest state in the union
[2:37:49.400 --> 2:37:52.680]  so uh... charlie was coming into work
[2:37:52.680 --> 2:37:57.560]  and in the fall of ninety three and you know said a little prayer
[2:37:57.560 --> 2:38:02.200]  and it came to him the tenth amendment was the way to go and then he went on the
[2:38:02.200 --> 2:38:06.040]  air i told him hey dude i'm ready let's do this
[2:38:06.040 --> 2:38:13.160]  and uh... january first i was his only aide he had no staff at that time so i
[2:38:13.160 --> 2:38:16.840]  did everything which means i set up his
[2:38:16.840 --> 2:38:21.800]  his radio appearances everything answered questions from the press
[2:38:21.800 --> 2:38:26.280]  we started uh... with the local talk shows and then it soon
[2:38:26.280 --> 2:38:29.800]  branched out and in nineteen ninety four
[2:38:29.800 --> 2:38:33.240]  early ninety four uh... about january he was
[2:38:33.240 --> 2:38:37.400]  he was on coast to coast today and with art bell before art bell became a
[2:38:37.400 --> 2:38:42.760]  flying saucer nut and then it really spread
[2:38:42.760 --> 2:38:45.640]  by the time oh and i'm about to be on tonight
[2:38:45.640 --> 2:38:49.960]  again it's that bush fire point sixteen million people
[2:38:49.960 --> 2:38:53.880]  uh... what a responsibility i've got this evening being on there
[2:38:53.880 --> 2:38:57.480]  uh... but but again history repeats itself let's continue
[2:38:57.480 --> 2:39:02.040]  and we by that time i mean he was on roger freddenberg he was on
[2:39:02.040 --> 2:39:06.200]  all the local shows in a in a period of less than
[2:39:06.200 --> 2:39:10.600]  oh from the time we started in session uh... the first of january
[2:39:10.600 --> 2:39:13.560]  until it was passed in the color of state house
[2:39:13.560 --> 2:39:17.720]  charlie was on probably eighty radio programs
[2:39:17.720 --> 2:39:22.040]  both national and local and that was the way we did it we didn't have the
[2:39:22.040 --> 2:39:26.040]  internet the internet at that time in nineteen ninety three ninety four
[2:39:26.040 --> 2:39:29.640]  was well most of us didn't even own a computer and that's why bill clinton
[2:39:29.640 --> 2:39:33.000]  came out and said we've got a shutdown talk radio limbaugh
[2:39:33.000 --> 2:39:36.920]  when limbaugh is an establishment frontman to neutralize conservatives
[2:39:36.920 --> 2:39:40.280]  they're actually worried about the regional syndicated shows and the local
[2:39:40.280 --> 2:39:43.480]  shows where the truth was getting out at the time and they wrote government
[2:39:43.480 --> 2:39:47.560]  memos now uh... hillary's back
[2:39:47.560 --> 2:39:50.440]  barack obama's back all these senators are back
[2:39:50.440 --> 2:39:54.840]  saying they do bill clinton said they want to shut down talk radio again
[2:39:54.840 --> 2:39:57.800]  where you can't have your political opinion just amazing because they're
[2:39:57.800 --> 2:39:59.000]  still worried about
[2:39:59.000 --> 2:40:02.600]  in group of scoundrels alec same group
[2:40:02.600 --> 2:40:06.200]  and they they knew they had to do something
[2:40:06.200 --> 2:40:09.560]  because it was growing back quickly uh... by
[2:40:09.560 --> 2:40:15.240]  uh... the time oklahoma city went up in and on april nineteenth ninety five
[2:40:15.240 --> 2:40:18.680]  uh... the tenth amendment resolution had already
[2:40:18.680 --> 2:40:23.160]  been introduced in forty seven state legislatures
[2:40:23.160 --> 2:40:25.160]  and you didn't hear word about it
[2:40:25.160 --> 2:40:28.040]  on on the media the media wouldn't even touch it
[2:40:28.040 --> 2:40:30.520]  but the alternative media was moving
[2:40:30.520 --> 2:40:31.560]  like mad
[2:40:31.560 --> 2:40:33.800]  uh... local radio talk shows
[2:40:33.800 --> 2:40:38.120]  uh... that the fax network between them uh... can you ask me what
[2:40:38.120 --> 2:40:39.240]  you know uh...
[2:40:39.240 --> 2:40:42.840]  uh... w o a i was doing and everybody so
[2:40:42.840 --> 2:40:45.000]  all across the nation it was a
[2:40:45.000 --> 2:40:48.280]  it was kind of the precursor to the internet
[2:40:48.280 --> 2:40:52.240]  uh... using talk radio and the militia movement exploded people found out that
[2:40:52.240 --> 2:40:53.920]  u n treaties have been signed
[2:40:53.920 --> 2:40:57.720]  bill clinton went on mtv and said we are gonna have gun confiscation
[2:40:57.720 --> 2:41:00.760]  janet rena said first we want to register them we want to confiscate
[2:41:00.760 --> 2:41:04.080]  they were on record just like attorney general holder who was the deputy then
[2:41:04.080 --> 2:41:04.960]  attorney general
[2:41:04.960 --> 2:41:08.360]  just like all these guys are in there now are on record for total
[2:41:08.360 --> 2:41:12.000]  gunbanz back the same thing the people are getting wise
[2:41:12.000 --> 2:41:14.760]  will the fed stage a false flag
[2:41:14.760 --> 2:41:18.440]  to try to all see the feds are good somebody attacked them the american
[2:41:18.440 --> 2:41:21.120]  people are bad it's american al-qaeda
[2:41:21.120 --> 2:41:24.760]  uh... that they're secretly training police and military that right now
[2:41:24.760 --> 2:41:28.200]  or will we back them off from staging a terror attack
[2:41:28.200 --> 2:41:32.200]  because we've exposed false flag terror exactly and uh... it
[2:41:32.200 --> 2:41:34.360]  you know it it's it's curious
[2:41:34.360 --> 2:41:35.480]  even back then
[2:41:35.480 --> 2:41:36.760]  we have problems
[2:41:36.760 --> 2:41:40.320]  kind of like what they had in in uh... new hampshire recently
[2:41:40.320 --> 2:41:42.800]  that won't that won't stop it in the boys
[2:41:42.800 --> 2:41:45.200]  they'll go back at it again just like we did
[2:41:45.200 --> 2:41:46.520]  we have defeat
[2:41:46.520 --> 2:41:48.960]  but we also have major victories
[2:41:48.960 --> 2:41:53.760]  and uh... right now there are fifteen states that have it all ready on their
[2:41:53.760 --> 2:41:54.880]  books
[2:41:54.880 --> 2:41:56.280]  all that and these
[2:41:56.280 --> 2:42:00.160]  uh... trying to find them on the internet is a little difficult sometimes
[2:42:00.160 --> 2:42:01.480]  but uh...
[2:42:01.480 --> 2:42:05.080]  i have a i have that thread running which is uh...

[2:42:35.160 --> 2:42:37.320]  will defeat the new world order
[2:42:37.320 --> 2:42:41.680]  and it says the law is clear the feds are in breach of contract the law is
[2:42:41.680 --> 2:42:42.760]  quite clear
[2:42:42.760 --> 2:42:46.080]  and you've done great research here a lengthy post

[2:44:25.400 --> 2:44:27.000]  and made
[2:44:27.000 --> 2:44:30.360]  and those uh... uh... as of nine twenty
[2:44:30.360 --> 2:44:34.000]  of ninety five which is september twentieth nineteen ninety five
[2:44:34.000 --> 2:44:37.360]  had passed through both houses of their legislature
[2:44:37.360 --> 2:44:40.960]  and had sent copies to the fed putting them on notice and then the feds
[2:44:40.960 --> 2:44:44.080]  bombed oklahoma city to teach everybody to love them and that's on record
[2:44:44.080 --> 2:44:47.320]  and i don't know aren't they good guys we got to stop these evil states rights
[2:44:47.320 --> 2:44:48.240]  people
[2:44:48.240 --> 2:44:51.680]  uh... so that's why they were so concerned carried that out and and so
[2:44:51.680 --> 2:44:54.040]  so you have fifteen states already did it now
[2:44:54.040 --> 2:44:55.320]  there's twenty
[2:44:55.320 --> 2:44:58.320]  the twenty first is texas but it just has the power to do it already
[2:44:58.320 --> 2:44:59.760]  on the books of twenty
[2:44:59.760 --> 2:45:01.080]  that have introduced it
[2:45:01.080 --> 2:45:05.600]  again but with stronger language about martial law gun confiscation
[2:45:05.600 --> 2:45:09.200]  force draft banning homeschooling saying no to the feds
[2:45:09.200 --> 2:45:13.240]  well this is very very exciting how do we get these fifteen
[2:45:13.240 --> 2:45:14.680]  where it's dormant
[2:45:14.680 --> 2:45:16.960]  how do we get them to start enforcing this
[2:45:16.960 --> 2:45:19.800]  this isn't this is also in that same thread
[2:45:19.800 --> 2:45:23.320]  uh... it's it's the very last post in that thread it has to do with the
[2:45:23.320 --> 2:45:25.360]  national solve or the uh...
[2:45:25.360 --> 2:45:27.000]  uh... tenth amendment
[2:45:27.000 --> 2:45:29.400]  state sovereignty act
[2:45:29.400 --> 2:45:30.760]  and it is
[2:45:30.760 --> 2:45:35.680]  uh... the the whole idea behind the the sovereignty resolution
[2:45:35.680 --> 2:45:39.520]  is to reaffirm and put the federal government on notice
[2:45:39.520 --> 2:45:41.680]  that the state understands
[2:45:41.680 --> 2:45:44.840]  that the federal government is a paper tiger
[2:45:44.840 --> 2:45:46.960]  created by the states
[2:45:46.960 --> 2:45:51.880]  and that the federal government is on notice that the states are going to take
[2:45:51.880 --> 2:45:54.680]  their rights and utilize them
[2:45:54.680 --> 2:45:58.320]  now what happened with of the guys in new hampshire
[2:45:58.320 --> 2:46:00.920]  is they've got all this stuff in there
[2:46:00.920 --> 2:46:04.720]  that is uh... that should come in a a later
[2:46:04.720 --> 2:46:07.360]  a piece of legislation in an act
[2:46:07.360 --> 2:46:11.400]  now the uh... the uh... state sovereignty act the first one that was
[2:46:11.400 --> 2:46:12.640]  implemented
[2:46:12.640 --> 2:46:15.640]  or that was well it wasn't implemented wish it was
[2:46:15.640 --> 2:46:20.240]  it was uh... introduced was in oklahoma by charles key
[2:46:20.240 --> 2:46:22.880]  and that was in nineteen ninety five
[2:46:22.880 --> 2:46:25.880]  and it's you can see it you can read it
[2:46:25.880 --> 2:46:28.240]  uh... in the last post
[2:46:28.240 --> 2:46:33.120]  of that that thread there on the present planet forum
[2:46:33.120 --> 2:46:34.200]  uh...
[2:46:34.200 --> 2:46:37.800]  that's how the fifteen states do it
[2:46:37.800 --> 2:46:41.000]  and they can they can enumerate whatever they want in there
[2:46:41.000 --> 2:46:42.840]  because all
[2:46:42.840 --> 2:46:45.360]  all powers
[2:46:45.360 --> 2:46:50.160]  that are not specifically delegated to the federal government
[2:46:50.160 --> 2:46:52.840]  by the constitution
[2:46:52.840 --> 2:46:54.520]  or reserved
[2:46:54.520 --> 2:46:56.320]  to the states
[2:46:56.320 --> 2:47:00.120]  are are given to the people and the state's respectful
[2:47:00.120 --> 2:47:03.160]  there are a lot of people i want to stop you right there
[2:47:03.160 --> 2:47:07.120]  ron paul was in the debates he was all over national television they tried to
[2:47:07.120 --> 2:47:11.520]  demonizing but he exposed the private offshore banks the scam they were running
[2:47:11.520 --> 2:47:14.160]  now he's better than ever even though they stopped him from winning the
[2:47:14.160 --> 2:47:15.360]  nomination
[2:47:15.360 --> 2:47:18.320]  that was a victory resistance is victory
[2:47:18.320 --> 2:47:22.160]  does it mean we win every battle george washington lost ninety plus percent
[2:47:22.160 --> 2:47:26.880]  uh... battles but they persevered they continued now
[2:47:26.880 --> 2:47:31.240]  we have fifteen states fourteen states have already passed this twenty states
[2:47:31.240 --> 2:47:33.800]  that are introduced at texas already has that power
[2:47:33.800 --> 2:47:37.160]  so what's twenty one and fourteen
[2:47:37.160 --> 2:47:40.760]  well i should be about uh...
[2:47:40.760 --> 2:47:41.920]  thirty five
[2:47:41.920 --> 2:47:42.560]  you know
[2:47:42.560 --> 2:47:45.920]  so we have we need all we need is thirty eight states but they have to do it
[2:47:45.920 --> 2:47:50.400]  independently here's one of the rough things that uh... the danger of a concon
[2:47:50.400 --> 2:47:54.520]  a concon can get called and the feds can slip in what they want or stage a terror
[2:47:54.520 --> 2:47:57.560]  attack during and rewrite everything we have to have the states
[2:47:57.560 --> 2:48:02.080]  individually as they were originally uh... uh... brought together under the
[2:48:02.080 --> 2:48:03.000]  union
[2:48:03.000 --> 2:48:05.840]  uh... they need to
[2:48:05.840 --> 2:48:08.560]  well i mean you've written all this out but but but i agree with it
[2:48:08.560 --> 2:48:12.880]  they need to separately declare this and then communicate with each other
[2:48:12.880 --> 2:48:16.920]  to direct orders at the feds there's no need to have a concon because they're not
[2:48:16.920 --> 2:48:19.920]  changing the constitution they're only enforcing
[2:48:19.920 --> 2:48:21.200]  that's exactly correct
[2:48:21.200 --> 2:48:23.680]  and and uh... with the easier
[2:48:23.680 --> 2:48:25.480]  the easiest way to look at it
[2:48:25.480 --> 2:48:28.400]  it's kind of like you know they're thirty five neighbors
[2:48:28.400 --> 2:48:30.440]  and you've got a problem with uh...
[2:48:30.440 --> 2:48:33.720]  you know they uh... you know the waterboard
[2:48:33.720 --> 2:48:36.760]  well you know you don't come together in a big meeting
[2:48:36.760 --> 2:48:37.860]  you all
[2:48:37.860 --> 2:48:41.080]  uh... communicate through phone
[2:48:41.080 --> 2:48:44.400]  uh... because you know y'all have to work during the day and setting up a
[2:48:44.400 --> 2:48:46.400]  meeting and all that is kind of rough
[2:48:46.400 --> 2:48:48.660]  so you communicate by courier
[2:48:48.660 --> 2:48:50.000]  the telephone
[2:48:50.000 --> 2:48:52.440]  and then you all independently
[2:48:52.440 --> 2:48:56.660]  call the water department and say fix the main and then if you have to meet two
[2:48:56.660 --> 2:48:57.560]  weeks later
[2:48:57.560 --> 2:49:00.360]  at the meeting you know ten of you show up and you know this is what everybody
[2:49:00.360 --> 2:49:03.520]  wants this happened in my neighborhood the trash company went from two days a
[2:49:03.520 --> 2:49:04.720]  week to one day a week
[2:49:04.720 --> 2:49:08.160]  they were cheating everybody on their water prices the neighborhood just got
[2:49:08.160 --> 2:49:10.920]  together and said you're fired we're hiring another company and that's
[2:49:10.920 --> 2:49:15.600]  exactly what we're doing now we need to take out the trash out
[2:49:15.600 --> 2:49:19.320]  and what i mean what happens when you have secret unlimited power in
[2:49:19.320 --> 2:49:21.080]  government since nineteen forty seven
[2:49:21.080 --> 2:49:23.960]  with the national security act nineteen thirteen before that night thirty three
[2:49:23.960 --> 2:49:25.440]  war powers act all that
[2:49:25.440 --> 2:49:28.240]  i mean you're going to get corruption and evil and out of control behavior and
[2:49:28.240 --> 2:49:31.720]  so now these bankers of all built offshore palaces
[2:49:31.720 --> 2:49:34.880]  they're destroying the country stealing everything
[2:49:34.880 --> 2:49:37.200]  that you know the public is so angry now
[2:49:37.200 --> 2:49:40.000]  i'm a tell the feds blown up a few federal buildings in going to get people
[2:49:40.000 --> 2:49:41.800]  to feel sorry for you and love you and
[2:49:41.800 --> 2:49:45.480]  believe the people are the enemy folks know you're a pack of criminals and
[2:49:45.480 --> 2:49:46.760]  to the listeners
[2:49:46.760 --> 2:49:48.680]  to dream is destiny
[2:49:48.680 --> 2:49:50.840]  and action is victory as i've said
[2:49:50.840 --> 2:49:53.680]  it is up to you whether this is going to happen are you gonna expose the
[2:49:53.680 --> 2:49:56.640]  bankers are you gonna expose the new world order you don't literally scream
[2:49:56.640 --> 2:49:59.800]  from the rooftops you're gonna do banger banner hangs are you gonna do
[2:49:59.800 --> 2:50:04.600]  whatever it takes to get this buzz going and never stop organically so that
[2:50:04.600 --> 2:50:07.320]  as the feds get worse and worse it may not pass now
[2:50:07.320 --> 2:50:10.400]  and the states may not act now but they will down the road
[2:50:10.400 --> 2:50:15.280]  as this is educated as the people know the solution the way out
[2:50:15.280 --> 2:50:19.440]  is dissolving the federal government through the states and then reconstituting
[2:50:19.440 --> 2:50:23.920]  it in the state so choose exactly all the all government all true government
[2:50:23.920 --> 2:50:24.880]  is local

[2:54:35.360 --> 2:54:38.040]  we're bringing down their new world order
[2:54:38.040 --> 2:54:41.280]  and we've done the work we've exposed the world government's architecture it's

[2:54:53.480 --> 2:54:56.440]  and to believe that they can affect change the level of crime the level of
[2:54:56.440 --> 2:54:57.440]  collapse
[2:54:57.440 --> 2:54:59.800]  the level of destruction they're bringing to this nation

[2:55:21.760 --> 2:55:24.640]  uh... and it's just going to get more intense and we're not going to back off
[2:55:24.640 --> 2:55:26.640]  and there's a lot of good people in government
[2:55:26.640 --> 2:55:29.800]  who are compartmentalized who didn't know what they were part of now they're
[2:55:29.800 --> 2:55:31.000]  waking up
[2:55:31.000 --> 2:55:33.480]  uh... that's what the government's trying to hire criminals and felons and
[2:55:33.480 --> 2:55:36.120]  foreigners to make up the military in the cia
[2:55:36.120 --> 2:55:37.920]  that's not going to work either

[2:56:03.240 --> 2:56:04.400]  uh...
[2:56:04.400 --> 2:56:06.200]  the easiest way to do it
[2:56:06.200 --> 2:56:08.160]  is to go to the main page

[2:56:12.200 --> 2:56:15.560]  all halfway down and it'll say
[2:56:15.560 --> 2:56:16.840]  uh...
[2:56:16.840 --> 2:56:19.680]  the radio show page which is
[2:56:19.680 --> 2:56:21.760]  uh... live show forum
[2:56:21.760 --> 2:56:25.800]  eleven a.m. to three p.m. cst
[2:56:25.800 --> 2:56:27.440]  and click on that
[2:56:27.440 --> 2:56:28.960]  and sticky
[2:56:28.960 --> 2:56:30.440]  in the very top
[2:56:30.440 --> 2:56:35.040]  of the uh... them the main discussion page there
[2:56:35.040 --> 2:56:36.200]  will be
[2:56:36.200 --> 2:56:38.560]  the uh... subject
[2:56:38.560 --> 2:56:41.640]  our tenth amendment sovereignty resolved
[2:56:41.640 --> 2:56:43.680]  will defeat the new world order
[2:56:43.680 --> 2:56:46.040]  okay well what i want
[2:56:46.040 --> 2:56:48.920]  is i want you guys to post this on the main page

[2:56:52.520 --> 2:56:53.520]  in there as well
[2:56:53.520 --> 2:56:55.360]  let's get all indexed in there
[2:56:55.360 --> 2:56:58.280]  and uh... people can add to it uh... but i want to keep it real clean of any
[2:56:58.280 --> 2:56:59.280]  disinfo
[2:56:59.280 --> 2:57:02.880]  now because this is a data page of being being a moderator i i
[2:57:02.880 --> 2:57:05.080]  i do keep it clean
[2:57:05.080 --> 2:57:08.040]  no i know you and i don't know i know i mean they come in there
[2:57:08.040 --> 2:57:11.600]  as you know and try to say kill this person kill that person oh yeah to get a
[2:57:11.600 --> 2:57:13.960]  shut down but thank god they're not successful
[2:57:13.960 --> 2:57:17.240]  know that this is uh... what people have to know
[2:57:17.240 --> 2:57:21.560]  is that all power resides in their hands and the hand and
[2:57:21.560 --> 2:57:24.200]  and their collective hands by the state
[2:57:24.200 --> 2:57:27.760]  because the states are the ones that created the constitution they are
[2:57:27.760 --> 2:57:30.440]  constituted by the people that's why all powers
[2:57:30.440 --> 2:57:32.840]  you know not delegated the federal government reserve the states or the
[2:57:32.840 --> 2:57:33.560]  people
[2:57:33.560 --> 2:57:37.040]  we're not slaves of the government no matter how much they say they're doing

[3:01:56.800 --> 3:02:02.800]  activist who helped get all this going in Colorado back in 93 94 we need the
[3:02:02.800 --> 3:02:06.480]  states to boldly also come out as New Hampshire and others are doing and saying
[3:02:06.480 --> 3:02:10.880]  look we know the John Warren defense authorization act in PDD 51 declare the
[3:02:10.880 --> 3:02:15.440]  federal Congress ceremonial that the president's a dictator his office in the
[3:02:15.440 --> 3:02:18.920]  National Security Council we know the John Warren defense authorization act and
[3:02:18.920 --> 3:02:23.800]  now public Pentagon announcements say the governors and the legislature serve at
[3:02:23.800 --> 3:02:27.680]  the pleasure of the president that's what Lincoln said he arrested hundreds of
[3:02:27.680 --> 3:02:32.640]  members of Congress newspaper editors put people in jail executed people even
[3:02:32.640 --> 3:02:36.920]  that you know the north didn't want the war well this isn't you know that day and
[3:02:36.920 --> 3:02:40.840]  age this is now this is asinine we need the states up front to say by the way
[3:02:40.840 --> 3:02:44.440]  don't try any funny business we know you're a pack of crooks and illegitimate
[3:02:44.440 --> 3:02:47.520]  we need this statement to be the federal government's controlled by foreign
[3:02:47.520 --> 3:02:50.800]  banks that's what Newsweek says but they say it's good and that it's a new world
[3:02:50.800 --> 3:02:55.880]  order we say we're dissolving you now I mean it's a pack of criminals up there
[3:02:55.880 --> 3:02:59.920]  we have to be bold and get bold ideas out or we'll just have a bunch of states
[3:02:59.920 --> 3:03:03.680]  past this and the feds will well like Charles Keith representative said the
[3:03:03.680 --> 3:03:06.920]  state police come in and lobby and threaten and freak out every time the
[3:03:06.920 --> 3:03:10.120]  state is about to become sovereign it's always been sovereign but redeclare it
[3:03:10.120 --> 3:03:13.640]  because they're really federal boys set up after the war powers act of thirty
[3:03:13.640 --> 3:03:18.280]  three final comments that that's absolutely correct all of those laws
[3:03:18.280 --> 3:03:24.080]  you know the military commissions act of 2006 the patriot act one and two all of
[3:03:24.080 --> 3:03:30.120]  them are that just he showed power to the federal agent at the expense of the
[3:03:30.120 --> 3:03:35.720]  states and the people the the thing that the states have to realize that you
[3:03:35.720 --> 3:03:40.760]  want to keep the broad language in the resolution to where it covers the entire
[3:03:40.760 --> 3:03:46.240]  spectrum of what the 10th amendment 9th and 10th amendments mean then you
[3:03:46.240 --> 3:03:52.880]  institute like Charlie Key did back of back in 95 the these state sovereignty
[3:03:52.880 --> 3:03:57.560]  act and you get it passed while the people are still thinking about this
[3:03:57.560 --> 3:04:03.720]  stuff the idea is introduced into their minds this is part of educating the
[3:04:03.720 --> 3:04:09.600]  public states good guys feds bad guys not yet and the the the bad guys aren't
[3:04:09.600 --> 3:04:14.120]  our federal government they are an offshore banking cartel they are the
[3:04:14.120 --> 3:04:19.920]  crowned heads of Europe yes they are all of the enemies of of the United States
[3:04:19.920 --> 3:04:26.920]  of America since we began and they have figured out a way through corporate law
[3:04:26.920 --> 3:04:35.600]  to take over I mean that's a whole nother program right there the the DC

[3:10:59.040 --> 3:11:02.760]  not this is not our only operation is the enemy the overall info war is the
[3:11:02.760 --> 3:11:04.320]  overarching program
[3:11:04.320 --> 3:11:07.720]  because by educating the public about the nature of the enemy their criminal
[3:11:07.720 --> 3:11:12.400]  control their fraudulent usurpation of our liberties and authority
[3:11:12.400 --> 3:11:16.040]  by doing that from being educated flows the freedom
[3:11:16.040 --> 3:11:19.760]  without that you have despotism and bondage
[3:11:19.760 --> 3:11:22.200]  so the ball is in your court uh...
[3:11:22.200 --> 3:11:25.160]  i want to go to your phone calls
[3:11:25.160 --> 3:11:27.960]  and i did take about ten calls earlier but what i do is
[3:11:27.960 --> 3:11:30.920]  each color brings up so many great points are i want to get off prosa what
[3:11:30.920 --> 3:11:32.720]  should i do and i've got to go through all
[3:11:32.720 --> 3:11:36.520]  medical you know thing about it and and and and and and warn them
[3:11:36.520 --> 3:11:39.360]  or you know they bring up this issue that issue i want to talk to jury in
[3:11:39.360 --> 3:11:41.720]  the netherlands jim and florida charles california
[3:11:41.720 --> 3:11:44.480]  jeff california mark and many others one eight hundred
[3:11:44.480 --> 3:11:48.440]  two five nine ninety two thirty one so in the interest of that almost about four
[3:11:48.440 --> 3:11:49.880]  minutes with ten anderson
[3:11:49.880 --> 3:11:54.760]  but it's been a few days since i had him on gold is now up above nine forty
[3:11:54.760 --> 3:11:58.600]  chad again ran out of the gold at the eight thirty level that he was selling
[3:11:58.600 --> 3:11:59.960]  when it was nine twenty five
[3:11:59.960 --> 3:12:03.440]  he ran out of that deal but he has the next best thing it's only going up from
[3:12:03.440 --> 3:12:06.600]  here the evidence uh... points in that direction
[3:12:06.600 --> 3:12:10.640]  with all the paper being devalued the stock market continuing to plunge
[3:12:10.640 --> 3:12:14.040]  ladies and gentlemen you need to get into golden silver and ted is almost run
[3:12:14.040 --> 3:12:17.480]  out of gold he bought the eight sixty five eight seventy level
[3:12:17.480 --> 3:12:19.960]  so we're talking about forty and thirty
[3:12:19.960 --> 3:12:22.120]  we're talking about uh...
[3:12:22.120 --> 3:12:26.200]  you know eighty dollar uh... seventy five dollar eighty dollar difference here
[3:12:26.200 --> 3:12:28.080]  uh... in the price of gold
[3:12:28.080 --> 3:12:32.040]  uh... that ted has he got it at that discount he's passing on the u but
[3:12:32.040 --> 3:12:35.320]  he told me this morning that's almost gone again and then you'll pay more down
[3:12:35.320 --> 3:12:36.680]  the road and i guess happily
[3:12:36.680 --> 3:12:39.320]  the point is this is a deal that cannot be beaten
[3:12:39.320 --> 3:12:40.800]  ted uh... what's going on
[3:12:40.800 --> 3:12:44.360]  well i mean it that you're just about right on the nail i mean that they hit
[3:12:44.360 --> 3:12:46.520]  the nail in the head with that uh...
[3:12:46.520 --> 3:12:50.720]  the supply of gold out there is so tight i mean i'm out there trying to buy this
[3:12:50.720 --> 3:12:51.480]  and that
[3:12:51.480 --> 3:12:55.480]  i get real small increments from everybody else is sold out ted
[3:12:55.480 --> 3:12:57.960]  well i mean you've been the leader because you've been able to keep it
[3:12:57.960 --> 3:13:00.320]  because you've been in business thirty years and have the connections
[3:13:00.320 --> 3:13:03.520]  well that's it is nice to have the connections and even though i do it's
[3:13:03.520 --> 3:13:07.440]  very difficult we do a lot of importing i'm really surprised how many
[3:13:07.440 --> 3:13:11.240]  british sovereigns i take in from europe and then people from britain call up and
[3:13:11.240 --> 3:13:13.440]  want to buy and back for me and i ship them
[3:13:13.440 --> 3:13:16.320]  right back to him i mean it's just uh... how that
[3:13:16.320 --> 3:13:18.400]  that whole process is going i mean we're
[3:13:18.400 --> 3:13:21.560]  we're selling more gold now on the weekends that we were for an entire
[3:13:21.560 --> 3:13:23.480]  month just a couple years ago
[3:13:23.480 --> 3:13:27.200]  and that's that's just a comparison to what's going on i know every dealer
[3:13:27.200 --> 3:13:30.040]  across the united states is dealing with the same thing
[3:13:30.040 --> 3:13:33.000]  uh... there is a lot of uh... huge shortage out there
[3:13:33.000 --> 3:13:37.200]  now if you google uh... gold sold out or gold dealer sold out
[3:13:37.200 --> 3:13:41.080]  most places say we're sold out or you can only buy one coin there's like a
[3:13:41.080 --> 3:13:44.640]  forty percent markup you're getting this below
[3:13:44.640 --> 3:13:47.320]  what it should even be sold for forget markup
[3:13:47.320 --> 3:13:50.800]  yeah i know that's what you would i do is like when gold dip down below nine
[3:13:50.800 --> 3:13:52.440]  hundred dollars an ounce here
[3:13:52.440 --> 3:13:54.520]  about a week and a half two weeks ago
[3:13:54.520 --> 3:13:57.680]  it got down about that eight seventy level and i said i'm just gonna buy as
[3:13:57.680 --> 3:13:59.000]  much as i can
[3:13:59.000 --> 3:14:02.440]  so here i've got my buyers just out there talking to dealers and trying to
[3:14:02.440 --> 3:14:04.240]  find out what we can accumulate
[3:14:04.240 --> 3:14:07.600]  and you know fill our safe supper at least have it coming or lock us in at a
[3:14:07.600 --> 3:14:08.440]  price
[3:14:08.440 --> 3:14:10.200]  so i know where i can sell
[3:14:10.200 --> 3:14:13.480]  uh... that eight seventy level gold right now is available
[3:14:13.480 --> 3:14:17.040]  we're offering the frank said two seventeen right now currently
[3:14:17.040 --> 3:14:19.520]  in today's market there are two thirty five
[3:14:19.520 --> 3:14:22.160]  i have the british sovereign at two sixty five
[3:14:22.160 --> 3:14:24.040]  the current market is two eighty eight
[3:14:24.040 --> 3:14:27.480]  now many of the frank was at two oh two here just a short while ago
[3:14:27.480 --> 3:14:28.680]  that i was selling a map
[3:14:28.680 --> 3:14:31.160]  now there are two seventeen that i'm selling for
[3:14:31.160 --> 3:14:34.720]  and people that about a two oh two can sell back at a nice little profit
[3:14:34.720 --> 3:14:36.760]  and that's just the way that it's been going
[3:14:36.760 --> 3:14:38.960]  now the silver coins i still have
[3:14:38.960 --> 3:14:40.560]  walking liberty halves
[3:14:40.560 --> 3:14:41.840]  and i also have
[3:14:41.840 --> 3:14:45.360]  the the mercury dimes and both of those are trading at a price
[3:14:45.360 --> 3:14:49.480]  back when gold was trading between nine and ten dollars amounts are sorry silver
[3:14:49.480 --> 3:14:53.000]  nine and ten dollars amounts i was able to pick up quite a few of us these
[3:14:53.000 --> 3:14:54.000]  bags of
[3:14:54.000 --> 3:14:58.360]  of haves and dimes and i'm still selling them at the exact same prices i was
[3:14:58.360 --> 3:14:59.360]  back then
[3:14:59.360 --> 3:15:02.200]  silver however at the at now at this time
[3:15:02.200 --> 3:15:06.840]  has almost seen fourteen dollars an ounce so that's up a tremendous amount
[3:15:06.840 --> 3:15:10.440]  from where it was and that is just a steal and that's because the banks have
[3:15:10.440 --> 3:15:14.500]  announced that they are fully gonna blow out the currency with tens of
[3:15:14.500 --> 3:15:17.520]  trillions of dollars this is on believable
[3:15:17.520 --> 3:15:21.200]  the hyperinflation alone is going to be devastated we're gonna have a real
[3:15:21.200 --> 3:15:22.040]  economy
[3:15:22.040 --> 3:15:23.640]  depression on top of it
[3:15:23.640 --> 3:15:27.280]  that's right alex every time you see this bailout i mean this eight hundred
[3:15:27.280 --> 3:15:31.120]  this eight hundred billion dollar bailout by brock obama is not going to be
[3:15:31.120 --> 3:15:35.240]  good for the u.s. dollar and reports that it's
[3:15:35.240 --> 3:15:40.040]  mandated so it's a four-year plan so it's actually four times that
[3:15:40.040 --> 3:15:43.200]  yep so here's what the thing is and then there's a bank bailout right behind
[3:15:43.200 --> 3:15:46.600]  it they're trying to push another bank bailout like we had one george bush
[3:15:46.600 --> 3:15:50.280]  well that's that's that's world leaders all meeting for breton woods three that
[3:15:50.280 --> 3:15:51.920]  breton woods two three months ago
[3:15:51.920 --> 3:15:56.040]  to shoot to openly set up the new world super bank to set the currencies and
[3:15:56.040 --> 3:15:57.040]  control them
[3:15:57.040 --> 3:16:01.680]  oh my god it's all happening ten all it is and it and and as soon as you start
[3:16:01.680 --> 3:16:06.400]  to see a world tax and it's probably gonna come in the form of a carbon tax
[3:16:06.400 --> 3:16:10.480]  you know that the sovereignty of this nation is ended well you know the senate
[3:16:10.480 --> 3:16:14.000]  has said it's going to be hundreds of new taxes under carbon to fund
[3:16:14.000 --> 3:16:15.600]  the new loans
[3:16:15.600 --> 3:16:18.200]  uh... from the private banks so so
[3:16:18.200 --> 3:16:21.200]  when we hear about bailing them out we're actually borrowing money from the
[3:16:21.200 --> 3:16:22.520]  private central banks
[3:16:22.520 --> 3:16:25.000]  to give it back to them to them be loaned back
[3:16:25.000 --> 3:16:28.000]  to the government of that sounds crazy because it is it's so fraudulent
[3:16:28.000 --> 3:16:30.520]  but i want to explain something to people you're gonna hear this is a new
[3:16:30.520 --> 3:16:33.040]  trillion dollar bailout
[3:16:33.040 --> 3:16:37.200]  the last bailout was unlimited trillions and no review is allowed
[3:16:37.200 --> 3:16:40.360]  uh... of it under the bill so why do they need a new bailout the new bailout of
[3:16:40.360 --> 3:16:42.280]  you read the financial times of one another's
[3:16:42.280 --> 3:16:45.480]  they will admit it is the new world banking structure to quote
[3:16:45.480 --> 3:16:46.640]  knock heads
[3:16:46.640 --> 3:16:49.640]  so this is it so people will hear it's a bailout
[3:16:49.640 --> 3:16:51.840]  it's not even that it's a takeover
[3:16:51.840 --> 3:16:55.680]  it sure is alex the sovereignty of the sovereignty of the united states of
[3:16:55.680 --> 3:16:57.240]  america is what's
[3:16:57.240 --> 3:16:59.760]  being held in the balance here everybody
[3:16:59.760 --> 3:17:01.960]  should be getting on their feet
[3:17:01.960 --> 3:17:06.160]  and becoming activists there should be nobody left back behind on this
[3:17:06.160 --> 3:17:08.360]  and that's why that's why
[3:17:08.360 --> 3:17:10.400]  we to save the union
[3:17:10.400 --> 3:17:12.000]  to save the republic
[3:17:12.000 --> 3:17:15.000]  the foreign bankers of seas control of the feds
[3:17:15.000 --> 3:17:16.960]  they're taking over the states we have to
[3:17:16.960 --> 3:17:18.280]  to take the states back
[3:17:18.280 --> 3:17:22.400]  and then reconstitute the republic on explain that here we are saving the
[3:17:22.400 --> 3:17:23.560]  union dead
[3:17:23.560 --> 3:17:27.080]  there is no question about it the only way you're gonna save the union is to
[3:17:27.080 --> 3:17:31.760]  get us back to constitutional money you you are not going to have liberty
[3:17:31.760 --> 3:17:33.560]  while you have a central bank
[3:17:33.560 --> 3:17:34.720]  doling out and
[3:17:34.720 --> 3:17:38.600]  and and uh... and deciding whether or not we can have good or bad economic
[3:17:38.600 --> 3:17:39.440]  times
[3:17:39.440 --> 3:17:41.600]  that should be judged upon the market
[3:17:41.600 --> 3:17:45.280]  and we shouldn't have to uh... we shouldn't have to answer to any central
[3:17:45.280 --> 3:17:46.360]  bank at all
[3:17:46.360 --> 3:17:50.000]  i mean that was fought out back when the when the constitution right you have
[3:17:50.000 --> 3:17:53.760]  the bankers unlimited power and secrecy they're gonna rape you
[3:17:53.760 --> 3:17:56.600]  i was i was reading a mcclatchy newspaper headline about

[3:24:32.320 --> 3:24:40.440]  here's the clutching news service right here and here's another one the dirty
[3:24:40.440 --> 3:24:44.120]  secret of the bailout 32 words to utter she they don't need a new bailout they
[3:24:44.120 --> 3:24:51.080]  have unlimited criminal power here but when you read the section oh I didn't
[3:24:51.080 --> 3:24:57.120]  grab I did grab page to we find the text of the bailout here I'm gonna find the
[3:24:57.120 --> 3:25:01.120]  actual page I printed this last night to find the page where it quoted the
[3:25:01.120 --> 3:25:10.280]  bailout I'll tell you Murphy's law one page in print where where it states no
[3:25:10.280 --> 3:25:13.880]  one can review it no one can look at it nobody can investigate it let's go to
[3:25:13.880 --> 3:25:20.080]  Jury in in the Netherlands jury and you're on the air go ahead hi Alex thanks
[3:25:20.080 --> 3:25:25.520]  for having me on I would like you to say you gave the assignment like a homework
[3:25:25.520 --> 3:25:29.720]  assignment to check out the term new world order into Google or just type it
[3:25:29.720 --> 3:25:34.200]  in and then go to news and look what you will find out well it's like hundreds
[3:25:34.200 --> 3:25:38.080]  of articles just about you know with the term you will order in it and then you
[3:25:38.080 --> 3:25:42.960]  have all kinds of variations like global order etc etc and and the key is
[3:25:42.960 --> 3:25:48.160]  they're saying it's what we say it is a world government run by one central bank
[3:25:48.160 --> 3:25:52.480]  where you pay carbon taxes but then Wikipedia says it doesn't exist and
[3:25:52.480 --> 3:25:59.160]  it's a theory and we're crazy right it's like absurd and these articles
[3:25:59.160 --> 3:26:05.280]  especially why it is important to read these because they all are more or less
[3:26:05.280 --> 3:26:09.680]  all go from the viewpoint that it's it's a good thing you know it's you know it's
[3:26:09.680 --> 3:26:14.480]  the best thing there is a crisis is created and we bring the solution I
[3:26:14.480 --> 3:26:20.480]  just right now I ran into one in times of crises never forget the value of gold
[3:26:20.480 --> 3:26:26.560]  on the Times Online webpage and it begins with saying that the dollar is
[3:26:26.560 --> 3:26:31.560]  simply a piece of paper and gold is much better of course it is but it ends with
[3:26:31.560 --> 3:26:36.320]  the following quote if I may a worldwide system of international money is
[3:26:36.320 --> 3:26:40.400]  needed without it recurrent crises such as the present one will be inevitable
[3:26:40.400 --> 3:26:44.840]  governments need to create a new world system in which gold as a stabilizer
[3:26:44.840 --> 3:26:49.640]  stability stabilizer should play its part I mean it's so subtle this
[3:26:49.640 --> 3:26:53.440]  what do we always say they're gonna destroy all the currencies of the
[3:26:53.440 --> 3:26:57.560]  world they've ordered all the gold and then gold's gonna go into the stratosphere
[3:26:57.560 --> 3:27:00.160]  people like with the why are you saying by gold because it's only way to protect
[3:27:00.160 --> 3:27:03.400]  yourself but they I mean I mean that's one of the only ways that's what I'm
[3:27:03.400 --> 3:27:08.360]  saying is that I mean did you hear me read Time magazine where the article was
[3:27:08.360 --> 3:27:11.920]  called the New World Order and it said a World Bank will rule the United States
[3:27:11.920 --> 3:27:16.480]  will pay taxes to it I mean that's in the Financial Times of London the Wall
[3:27:16.480 --> 3:27:20.440]  Street Journal says the only solution is world government on a marrow I mean
[3:27:20.440 --> 3:27:24.120]  that they're pushing it and then meanwhile Rush Limbaugh says it doesn't
[3:27:24.120 --> 3:27:30.960]  exist Obama says it doesn't exist and Wikipedia says we're making it up
[3:27:30.960 --> 3:27:37.080]  yeah this double thing has to stop you know sooner or later it is double thing
[3:27:37.080 --> 3:27:48.160]  isn't it yeah pretty awful our other oh sorry no go ahead I found another quote
[3:27:48.160 --> 3:27:54.800]  on the European voice.com website it said a global green new deal is needed I
[3:27:54.800 --> 3:28:01.760]  mean give me a break they want a new green in a new deal like a Roosevelt style
[3:28:01.760 --> 3:28:07.800]  but then globally and green I mean give me a break that's the taxes that's the
[3:28:07.800 --> 3:28:11.080]  taxes send me the article I hadn't seen that one I've seen probably 500 others
[3:28:11.080 --> 3:28:14.560]  I'm not exaggerating I mean if you type the term New World Order thousands of
[3:28:14.560 --> 3:28:24.200]  articles come up that are mainstream news. Pretty bizarre. I will email it to
[3:28:24.200 --> 3:28:29.800]  Aaron at infowords.com yes are folks waking up in the Netherlands well
[3:28:29.800 --> 3:28:37.480]  slowly but surely they I mean we just had a chip like a RFID chip for the
[3:28:37.480 --> 3:28:43.480]  transportation in Rotterdam the Harbor City and it's being rejected you know
[3:28:43.480 --> 3:28:48.840]  in mass so that's that's pretty good there's still has to be a lot of work
[3:28:48.840 --> 3:28:52.480]  needs to be done that's right the people instinctively know it's a fraud good to
[3:28:52.480 --> 3:28:55.920]  hear from you pull up on this computer I want to show people the Huffington
[3:28:55.920 --> 3:28:58.520]  Post articles the one I wanted to talk about that when I keep mentioning and
[3:28:58.520 --> 3:29:01.160]  somebody emailed me for days ago going the bill didn't say that well you can
[3:29:01.160 --> 3:29:05.680]  link through and read the bank or bailout bill all right down here it says
[3:29:05.680 --> 3:29:09.280]  decisions by the secretary pursuant to the authority of this act are non
[3:29:09.280 --> 3:29:13.680]  renewable and committed to agency discretion and may not be reviewed by
[3:29:13.680 --> 3:29:18.520]  any court or law or any administrative agency and then they pass the bill and
[3:29:18.520 --> 3:29:21.600]  they won't say how many trillions have been stolen though it's leaked out that
[3:29:21.600 --> 3:29:27.400]  it's over nine trillion according to Bloomberg and AP and we're now four
[3:29:27.400 --> 3:29:30.600]  months into this and now they want a new banker bailout why would they need a
[3:29:30.600 --> 3:29:34.280]  new banker bailout they got a limited power because the new deal is to sign
[3:29:34.280 --> 3:29:38.360]  everything over to this new global banking system so there's the headline
[3:29:38.360 --> 3:29:43.200]  dirty secret of the bailout 32 words that done that none dare utter will come

[3:35:04.200 --> 3:35:08.600]  Willie to get his message out you guys could make a little money and lots of
[3:35:08.600 --> 3:35:12.000]  people I don't approach I don't approach Willie Nelson about money
[3:35:12.000 --> 3:35:15.360]  stuff I mean I got his home number and his cell phone I can call him up I'm
[3:35:15.360 --> 3:35:18.480]  sure I could go hang out with him again if I want to he's a busy guy on tour
[3:35:18.480 --> 3:35:22.360]  200-something days out of the year he makes movies just because Willie Nelson
[3:35:22.360 --> 3:35:25.560]  reached out to us just because I've had him on the air just because I'm hung out
[3:35:25.560 --> 3:35:30.440]  with him and Jesse Ventura boy that was crazy you know doesn't mean that again
[3:35:30.440 --> 3:35:37.320]  I'm doing everything I can and you know people like me that are in
[3:35:37.320 --> 3:35:40.080]  entertainment stuff because they like the information we put out I don't show
[3:35:40.080 --> 3:35:45.400]  up with a t-shirt saying an inside job please wear this Willie but it's really
[3:35:45.400 --> 3:35:50.000]  we're about getting the people taking action but I mean yeah that I mean that
[3:35:50.000 --> 3:35:53.960]  would be great if we had that but we don't yeah I don't want to call you a
[3:35:53.960 --> 3:35:57.200]  couple times over a year ago and suggested that everybody write input
[3:35:57.200 --> 3:36:02.080]  money you know you set that for a couple of seconds and then you said that's the
[3:36:02.080 --> 3:36:05.520]  kind of thing that could resonate exponentially and you know what that
[3:36:05.520 --> 3:36:08.960]  turned out to be sort of pathetic didn't it Alex there are a lot of folks
[3:36:08.960 --> 3:36:14.040]  writing info wars.com and prisonplanet.com on the cash yeah I'm just
[3:36:14.040 --> 3:36:17.440]  well wrecking our brains trying to think of ways to get the word out you know and
[3:36:17.440 --> 3:36:21.680]  by the way a lot of stories possible I hear you and I appreciate your call the
[3:36:21.680 --> 3:36:27.800]  a lot of cars I'm off the subject now because I get so confused people talking
[3:36:27.800 --> 3:36:31.440]  a lot of people do have stuff on their cars on money on things like that's
[3:36:31.440 --> 3:36:34.640]  having a big effect and I forget the other point I was gonna make let's go
[3:36:34.640 --> 3:36:39.560]  ahead and take another call here let's go ahead and talk to Charles in
[3:36:39.560 --> 3:36:46.360]  California Charles go ahead. Hi, can you hear me Alex? Yes. Hi, I'm just curious if you were
[3:36:46.360 --> 3:36:50.360]  familiar with or you would consider having a guest to interview on your show
[3:36:50.360 --> 3:36:55.400]  perhaps Trit Resner the lead singer for the band Nine Inch Nails he did an album a
[3:36:55.400 --> 3:37:00.560]  year ago called Year Zero that deals with martial law the police state the
[3:37:00.560 --> 3:37:03.400]  incrementalism all the stuff that you talked about I was curious if you'd have
[3:37:03.400 --> 3:37:08.200]  him as a guest on your show and my other question was I was curious I've never
[3:37:08.200 --> 3:37:12.160]  heard you talk about Jimmy Carter and the Carter administration because Jimmy
[3:37:12.160 --> 3:37:17.440]  it seems to me anyway that he tried to install a lot of policies like Ron Paul
[3:37:17.440 --> 3:37:21.940]  but failed to do so. No he actually set up FEMA did a lot of bad because I know
[3:37:21.940 --> 3:37:24.360]  people that were in the Carter administration high-level he was a
[3:37:24.360 --> 3:37:33.080]  decent excuse me I've had a really bad allergies with this cedar pollen makes
[3:37:33.080 --> 3:37:35.960]  me cough a lot. Hey, will somebody bring me a glass of a
[3:37:35.960 --> 3:37:41.720]  color blue water please thank you. Jimmy Carter was a front man Jimmy Carter
[3:37:41.720 --> 3:37:44.300]  didn't know what was going on Jimmy Carter was controlled by Zabignan
[3:37:44.300 --> 3:37:48.120]  Brzezinski who funded Pol Pot to kill two to three million people and he brags
[3:37:48.120 --> 3:37:51.840]  about it in Cambodia. Jimmy Carter brought in a whole lot of bad stuff and
[3:37:51.840 --> 3:37:56.040]  was basically just used as a front man by the New World Order but go ahead.
[3:37:56.040 --> 3:38:00.760]  I was just kind of curious because I had never really heard you talk about it but
[3:38:00.760 --> 3:38:06.400]  I also want to recommend there's a guy named Greg Reffen who he's the
[3:38:06.400 --> 3:38:10.400]  he's the front man of the band Bad Religion he talks also a lot about the
[3:38:10.400 --> 3:38:13.680]  stuff that you talk about I was curious if you'd either consider perhaps him or
[3:38:13.680 --> 3:38:16.920]  or Tre Reznor from Men in Channels to be a guest on your show. Let me tell you what
[3:38:16.920 --> 3:38:21.680]  happens a lot of you know these people every week or more often I have big
[3:38:21.680 --> 3:38:30.560]  country music people rock and roll folks blues you name it movie stars call here
[3:38:30.560 --> 3:38:33.720]  and nine times out of ten I end up you know getting around to calling them
[3:38:33.720 --> 3:38:36.600]  back and they're like I just want to tell you're doing a great job and I
[3:38:36.600 --> 3:38:39.800]  really appreciate you but I don't want to go public I got a lot of private
[3:38:39.800 --> 3:38:43.920]  personal things going on right now and I'm in a divorce or this or that and you
[3:38:43.920 --> 3:38:48.080]  know I well that doesn't really do anything which is fine and dandy but
[3:38:48.080 --> 3:38:51.920]  we're not just into hanging around with celebrities so I always get invited out
[3:38:51.920 --> 3:38:55.760]  to somebody's house or I get invited up to somebody's penthouse or I get invited
[3:38:55.760 --> 3:38:59.480]  to hey get on my jet and go with me to you know we're going to London for the
[3:38:59.480 --> 3:39:06.000]  weekend or Paris or something bring your wife instead I'm and maybe I should do
[3:39:06.000 --> 3:39:08.000]  that because then I get to know them and get them on air and it would get the
[3:39:08.000 --> 3:39:11.960]  information out more because this is a hype driven society I'm going to be here
[3:39:11.960 --> 3:39:14.840]  working all day I'm gonna run home and see my children for about two hours and
[3:39:14.840 --> 3:39:18.280]  I'm gonna come back into coast to coast AM work on the film and I'll get to bed
[3:39:18.280 --> 3:39:22.600]  about probably 430 in the morning tomorrow and I'm not again it's all
[3:39:22.600 --> 3:39:25.640]  about me I should get this celebrity I should get that celebrity I should do
[3:39:25.640 --> 3:39:29.400]  this I should get that I should have this person on and those are all
[3:39:29.400 --> 3:39:34.000]  great ideas I've been pointed out that my office that Trent Reznor does talk
[3:39:34.000 --> 3:39:39.160]  about the new world order we haven't reached out to Trent Reznor I've heard
[3:39:39.160 --> 3:39:42.360]  about the bad religion in fact I had one of the guys here in the office telling
[3:39:42.360 --> 3:39:48.720]  me about that audio slave is putting on anti-new order stuff that's good that's
[3:39:48.720 --> 3:39:53.120]  them out there doing their own thing and if they want to contact me and say they
[3:39:53.120 --> 3:39:56.360]  want to come on air we'll have them on air we're not out there trying to track
[3:39:56.360 --> 3:40:01.640]  down celebrities just to get them on just to do it
[3:40:01.640 --> 3:40:10.520]  no Charlie Sheen contacted me folks with Jesse Ventura contacted us folks with
[3:40:10.520 --> 3:40:15.040]  I mean the whole Willie Nelson thing is he was at an event that I was at I saw
[3:40:15.040 --> 3:40:18.040]  him he said hey I'd come on your show sometime like what you're doing I gave
[3:40:18.040 --> 3:40:24.720]  him some videos and then boom six months later he calls up and I almost don't
[3:40:24.720 --> 3:40:28.080]  like doing it it's very it's a double-edged sword and I appreciate your
[3:40:28.080 --> 3:40:31.560]  call there's all this news going on folks we shouldn't be talking about me all
[3:40:31.560 --> 3:40:36.400]  day but you know it's all about the effectiveness to get in the word out he
[3:40:36.400 --> 3:40:42.880]  you know when I have big celebrities on the show a lot of the general public and
[3:40:42.880 --> 3:40:46.920]  other activists think that celebrities like live on clouds and they float around
[3:40:46.920 --> 3:40:51.320]  in angel world and you're not fulfilled until you're a celebrity but then you
[3:40:51.320 --> 3:40:55.160]  really get a chance and I know a lot of celebrities folks because I've been in a
[3:40:55.160 --> 3:40:59.320]  few movies and some other things and I've consulted for some other films not
[3:40:59.320 --> 3:41:02.640]  just scanner darkly but I don't want to get on record some of the films I've
[3:41:02.640 --> 3:41:08.800]  consulted for I didn't like how some of them turned out but mm-hmm so you're
[3:41:08.800 --> 3:41:11.880]  sitting there in somebody's Hollywood house they're interesting they're cool
[3:41:11.880 --> 3:41:16.200]  people but they're they don't want to go out to get dinner because people mob them
[3:41:16.200 --> 3:41:22.200]  and you're just there and it's just another person I got to say hanging out
[3:41:22.200 --> 3:41:26.240]  for won't just one time four hours willing else and at his house he brings
[3:41:26.240 --> 3:41:30.320]  very few people in his house itself you know hanging out in his bedroom playing
[3:41:30.320 --> 3:41:34.640]  chess with Jesse Ventura and Willie Nelson and Alex Jones that that's
[3:41:34.640 --> 3:41:40.320]  pretty weird I mean that's pretty cool but you know it's the mission it's the
[3:41:40.320 --> 3:41:46.840]  mission it's the mission and people get so jealous of that that it becomes
[3:41:46.840 --> 3:41:50.240]  destructive because we're here trying to get the word out get other activists to
[3:41:50.240 --> 3:41:54.560]  go out and and and and wait people up and be about issues and every time I have
[3:41:54.560 --> 3:41:58.880]  some big celebrity on people just go ape with the disinfo in the lies of the
[3:41:58.880 --> 3:42:03.040]  attacks and it's not government most of it it is the sick fallen nature of
[3:42:03.040 --> 3:42:08.920]  society and a lot of people who are in power positions get off on people being
[3:42:08.920 --> 3:42:12.800]  jealous of them they they love being attacked they think it's funny they know
[3:42:12.800 --> 3:42:18.880]  it's jealousy and at a sick level I kind of like it too but it's sick and so it
[3:42:18.880 --> 3:42:24.800]  actually hurts my feelings because we have no future folks I mean I'm having
[3:42:24.800 --> 3:42:28.560]  discussions with my wife about you know is it moral that we're staying here as
[3:42:28.560 --> 3:42:33.760]  the country collapses but we made decisions to stay and that's a big
[3:42:33.760 --> 3:42:45.520]  decision when you're Alex Jones and so I understand how life and death all this
[3:42:45.520 --> 3:42:50.040]  is this isn't a joke or a game for me and that's why I can work as hard as I do
[3:42:50.040 --> 3:42:53.800]  and and other things I do because I understand this is life and death folks
[3:42:53.800 --> 3:43:01.000]  I've got my priorities in line and I try to work with everybody that's uplifting
[3:43:01.000 --> 3:43:04.320]  everybody that's networking everybody that's decent wholesome if you don't
[3:43:04.320 --> 3:43:08.160]  hear somebody on this show who's prominent in the fight it's no order it
[3:43:08.160 --> 3:43:13.480]  means they're bad news from my experience and what I've dealt with and it's just
[3:43:13.480 --> 3:43:17.200]  very destructive overall the things that go on now we've had two calls in a row
[3:43:17.200 --> 3:43:20.880]  about celebrities that's what I'm saying it's kind of sick at a certain level
[3:43:20.880 --> 3:43:25.040]  yeah we have a big celebrity on it blows the show up even bigger other
[3:43:25.040 --> 3:43:31.360]  celebrities then start tuning in but then it just kind of becomes a self-fulfilling
[3:43:31.360 --> 3:43:35.680]  you know prophecy of your show being about that
[3:43:37.720 --> 3:43:42.360]  and that's basically it FEMA camps are being built they've introduced gun
[3:43:42.360 --> 3:43:46.720]  confiscation and gunman bills they are bringing in a new world order setting up
[3:43:46.720 --> 3:43:55.800]  carbon taxes it's happening I mean look at this hamburgers are the hummers of
[3:43:55.800 --> 3:44:00.600]  food and global warming and they say that cows methane is evil and hamburgers
[3:44:00.600 --> 3:44:04.200]  bad and not only is there gonna be a global warming tax on the cows and all
[3:44:04.200 --> 3:44:07.200]  their farm animals themselves and all the federal control that comes with that
[3:44:07.200 --> 3:44:11.920]  but that they're gonna put a tax on you eating hamburger folks I told you this
[3:44:11.920 --> 3:44:17.680]  they've said it ice cream pastries hamburgers everything and with that the
[3:44:17.680 --> 3:44:22.600]  federal control over the food supply when it comes to global warming hamburgers
[3:44:22.600 --> 3:44:26.960]  are the hummers of food scientists say from agency French press and they just
[3:44:26.960 --> 3:44:31.480]  state this like it's a fact simply switching from steak to salad could cut
[3:44:31.480 --> 3:44:35.480]  as much carbon as leaving the car at home a couple of days a week yeah what
[3:44:35.480 --> 3:44:39.040]  that's solid breathe that breathe carbon dioxide that's because beef is such an
[3:44:39.040 --> 3:44:42.560]  incredibly inefficient food to produce and cows really so much harmful methane
[3:44:42.560 --> 3:44:48.280]  to the atmosphere said Nathan Pelletier of Dalhousie University in Canada they're
[3:44:48.280 --> 3:44:50.840]  one of a growing number of scientists studying the environmental cost of food
[3:44:50.840 --> 3:44:58.920]  from the field to play and they said they want to tax it 78% of emissions from
[3:44:58.920 --> 3:45:06.400]  the cows I mean methane is part of our atmosphere that's why the planet's alive
[3:45:06.400 --> 3:45:12.920]  it's good the gases in the atmosphere protect us from the solar radiation
[3:45:12.920 --> 3:45:16.920]  folks it's such an insult to everyone that they have everybody wanting to ban
[3:45:16.920 --> 3:45:22.400]  carbon dioxide it's what plants breathe where's my astronaut article oh it
[3:45:22.400 --> 3:45:25.080]  doesn't matter here's a New York Times saying do we need a new internet and they
[3:45:25.080 --> 3:45:29.880]  said they're gonna kill the old internet and have an internet that quote where you
[3:45:29.880 --> 3:45:41.200]  give up your freedoms for safety I mean this is just amazing all right let's go
[3:45:41.200 --> 3:45:47.760]  back to your calls here who's up next Jeff Jeff in California go ahead you're
[3:45:47.760 --> 3:45:56.560]  on the air can you hear me Alex yes sir yes I had a question my grandpa was in
[3:45:56.560 --> 3:46:02.500]  the Marine Corps for 22 years he retired as a major he just died recently in
[3:46:02.500 --> 3:46:10.080]  October 29th do you think what part of the Agent Orange killed him I don't know
[3:46:10.080 --> 3:46:13.480]  that Agent Orange killed him I know Agent Orange lasts for over a hundred
[3:46:13.480 --> 3:46:17.120]  years and there's whole areas of Hawaii and where it's been used and also in
[3:46:17.120 --> 3:46:20.640]  Vietnam other areas where it's been used where no plants still grow and it
[3:46:20.640 --> 3:46:23.600]  massively increases cancers and all sorts of other health problems and Burt
[3:46:23.600 --> 3:46:27.000]  defects and they knew it when they sprayed it they have the troops walk right
[3:46:27.000 --> 3:46:35.520]  through it yeah I really feel sorry for him he just was and also why did he not
[3:46:35.520 --> 3:46:39.920]  why did he like Bush I don't get it I kept trying because they have the
[3:46:39.920 --> 3:46:43.320]  Liberals come out with things he knows are bad and so then he thinks Bush is
[3:46:43.320 --> 3:46:46.600]  the alternative and then Liberals don't like Bush so they think Obama's the
[3:46:46.600 --> 3:46:51.560]  alternative they're caught up in those two phony choices yeah like if I came to
[3:46:51.560 --> 3:46:55.240]  your door and said I've got a blue vacuum cleaner red vacuum cleaner and
[3:46:55.240 --> 3:46:59.560]  then you can make the choice it's a psychological game it's a false choice
[3:46:59.560 --> 3:47:04.920]  how about I already got a vacuum cleaner thank you okay I also have another
[3:47:04.920 --> 3:47:10.560]  question my name what do I tell my neighbor she's very pro Obama she can't
[3:47:10.560 --> 3:47:18.120]  she says that he can I think she thinks he can do no wrong what can I what if he
[3:47:18.120 --> 3:47:24.080]  done that I can tell her that is bad well we're gonna expand it but it the
[3:47:24.080 --> 3:47:29.480]  Obama deception net the Obama deception net right there by the way the film is
[3:47:29.480 --> 3:47:32.680]  now in pre-order it ships on March 15th first come first serve the orders that
[3:47:32.680 --> 3:47:38.660]  come in the film covers it all but there's a section on Obama's lies his
[3:47:38.660 --> 3:47:42.240]  flip-flopping his police state the things he's done we're gonna update it
[3:47:42.240 --> 3:47:47.080]  even some more because there's so much that's right there on the side sir yeah
[3:47:47.080 --> 3:47:53.360]  I do know that Congress just passed a bill that is that they didn't even get
[3:47:53.360 --> 3:48:00.000]  to read and this new stimulus bill was what 700 billion probably isn't it more
[3:48:00.000 --> 3:48:04.920]  like trillions yeah because it's it's it's it's it it's mandated each year to
[3:48:04.920 --> 3:48:08.720]  continue with the funding I look I appreciate your call I covered this
[3:48:08.720 --> 3:48:14.800]  last Sunday night last night it all just runs together now Obama said it must
[3:48:14.800 --> 3:48:19.520]  pass it must pass do the destruction I will sign it the minute it's passed then
[3:48:19.520 --> 3:48:24.720]  it signed Friday he goes on vacation till tomorrow a five-day vacation Friday

[3:54:06.840 --> 3:54:12.680]  GMO was created by the eugenicists they understand that breeding and seeds and
[3:54:12.680 --> 3:54:16.920]  animals is key and they just conditioned us to announce hey clone beef on

[3:54:21.440 --> 3:54:25.560]  now it's all been announced oh we're doing cross-bc human hybrids for organ
[3:54:25.560 --> 3:54:30.280]  artisan but we're keeping them small down at the little embryo level then you
[3:54:30.280 --> 3:54:35.280]  read deeper the research they're not that's the stuff they admit spicing
[3:54:35.280 --> 3:54:42.000]  humans with pigs they're about 20 years ago they admit spiders with goats for
[3:54:42.000 --> 3:54:45.680]  body armor okay
[3:54:46.680 --> 3:54:57.560]  fighters with goats for both spiders with goats for body armor guys he says
[3:54:57.560 --> 3:55:02.600]  if you go back and research what he is talking about you will find spiders with
[3:55:02.600 --> 3:55:13.520]  goats for body armor now about Alex Jones and similar people that are you
[3:55:13.520 --> 3:55:19.480]  know pretty much in the same arena trying to wake people up like him I just
[3:55:19.480 --> 3:55:28.800]  want to give a warning beware of group thing and always research everything
[3:55:28.800 --> 3:55:42.160]  okay now when I say beware of group thing now if there was say a band that you
[3:55:42.160 --> 3:55:48.640]  went to go see a musical band that was you know they were kind of lousy and
[3:55:48.640 --> 3:55:57.960]  they didn't really fit your style and he didn't really just like what they were
[3:55:57.960 --> 3:56:07.960]  doing but you applauded and screamed anyway along with the rest of the crowd
[3:56:08.160 --> 3:56:19.720]  that is very dangerous and I'll explain to you why because when it comes to the
[3:56:19.720 --> 3:56:26.560]  Alex Jones type not just Alex Jones but anybody like him now listen to me I'm a
[3:56:26.560 --> 3:56:33.880]  fan of him okay I enjoy the info that he has to give I do not believe 100% in
[3:56:33.880 --> 3:56:40.120]  anything anybody says I research and then I believe after that research is
[3:56:40.120 --> 3:56:48.080]  complete but when it comes to people like that that are very prominent in what
[3:56:48.080 --> 3:56:52.400]  we call the truth movement or the patriotic movement whatever the hell
[3:56:52.400 --> 3:56:57.840]  we're going by the people that are awake somebody very prominent like this
[3:56:57.840 --> 3:57:09.440]  individual can mislead a group of people just because they trust him even though
[3:57:09.440 --> 3:57:16.840]  I've researched a lot of what this man says and a lot of it is true I'm not
[3:57:16.840 --> 3:57:22.160]  trying to discredit him but I haven't even researched the thing he just
[3:57:22.160 --> 3:57:26.680]  said it just sounds too silly to actually bother the research right there I
[3:57:26.680 --> 3:57:29.400]  don't have time to put the rest of it here's a London telegraph on screen
[3:57:29.400 --> 3:57:33.040]  spider goats put punch it back up so I can read it spider goats start work on
[3:57:33.040 --> 3:57:36.920]  Wonder Web 2002 I interviewed the CEO of the company they got a bunch of companies
[3:57:36.920 --> 3:57:42.120]  doing it what I said was mixing I was talking about mixing species mixing
[3:57:42.120 --> 3:57:46.880]  spiders and goats to then get body armor from the goats and he said no
[3:57:46.880 --> 3:57:52.520]  spiders are wearing goats on their backs as a shield that's not what I said I
[3:57:52.520 --> 3:57:57.200]  was talking about it cross species and it's true and people email me every day
[3:57:57.200 --> 3:58:00.560]  saying I'm a liar and because they can't believe that because they're thinking
[3:58:00.560 --> 3:58:04.560]  of 1970 science fiction this is what the government admits they're doing imagine
[3:58:04.560 --> 3:58:08.120]  what else they're doing again I'm telling you the truth check the
