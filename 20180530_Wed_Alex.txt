[00:00.000 --> 00:17.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Commence Center and the heart of the resistance.
[00:17.000 --> 00:23.440]  Rallying Patriots worldwide.
[00:23.440 --> 00:33.080]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33.080 --> 00:34.080]  And finally, new rule.
[00:34.080 --> 00:39.560]  Now that he's suing me for five million dollars because he says he's proved that he is not
[00:39.560 --> 00:47.800]  the love child of an orangutan, Donald Trump must learn two things.
[00:47.800 --> 00:51.240]  What a joke is and what a contract is.
[00:51.240 --> 01:02.840]  Now, let me catch you up on how all this got started during the last week of the presidential
[01:02.840 --> 01:03.840]  campaign.
[01:03.840 --> 01:04.840]  That's good.
[01:04.840 --> 01:12.120]  Now the big question here is obviously, will Bill Maher of real time be fired by HBO for
[01:12.120 --> 01:18.520]  calling the president a racially insensitive term because you can pair someone with strawberry
[01:18.520 --> 01:23.440]  blonde hair to an orangutan, you're being racist against white people for comparing them
[01:23.440 --> 01:24.440]  to a primate.
[01:24.440 --> 01:33.720]  But of course, Bill Maher should not be fired because you could argue that Donald Trump does
[01:33.720 --> 01:41.280]  have orangutan colored orange hair, at least used to he did and it's more gray blonde now.
[01:41.280 --> 01:42.280]  And it's a funny joke.
[01:42.280 --> 01:45.120]  And when I saw it at the time, I thought it was funny.
[01:45.120 --> 01:49.920]  I've called Trump the golden code, I've called myself a pumpkin head.
[01:49.920 --> 01:52.440]  I have a very large head.
[01:52.440 --> 01:55.280]  That said, this is the death of comedy.
[01:55.280 --> 01:58.960]  It's the same thing that Seinfeld's talked about and many others, we can't even go on
[01:58.960 --> 02:03.120]  universities anymore and tell basic jokes.
[02:03.120 --> 02:07.760]  Remember Seinfeld's own 13 year old daughter, he said, we're going to move back from upstate
[02:07.760 --> 02:11.760]  New York or ranch or farm back to the cities, you can meet more boys.
[02:11.760 --> 02:18.040]  And his daughter said, dad, this is two years ago, that's sexist even say boy.
[02:18.040 --> 02:20.400]  That's the cultural brainwashing.
[02:20.400 --> 02:23.640]  That's the real authoritarianism here and you know, I'm gonna have a dog in the fight
[02:23.640 --> 02:25.600]  for Roseanne Barb.
[02:25.600 --> 02:28.440]  She's come on the show before she says she's a listener.
[02:28.440 --> 02:32.520]  I think one of her personalities listens to the show.
[02:32.520 --> 02:36.600]  I think Roseanne Barb obviously is on substance abuse.
[02:36.600 --> 02:37.600]  A lot of people are.
[02:37.600 --> 02:45.000]  They're not putting the lady down, but the point is, is that she's now coming out falling
[02:45.000 --> 02:52.880]  on her sword apologizing, groveling, saying I was on Ambien, I had a bad experience.
[02:52.880 --> 02:56.400]  She says that, you know, it's rough having seven personalities.
[02:56.400 --> 03:00.680]  Roseanne Barb says she has seven personalities, whether it's true or not.
[03:00.680 --> 03:04.880]  This whole show, I actually watched a few of the episodes and it's exactly what I thought
[03:04.880 --> 03:05.880]  it was.
[03:05.880 --> 03:11.120]  There was a lure libertarian and conservative viewers back in that have a bunch of Islamists
[03:11.120 --> 03:19.640]  on the show and basically another Archie Bunker versus Meathead rerun to sit there and social
[03:19.640 --> 03:21.160]  engineer people.
[03:21.160 --> 03:25.200]  And as they added more and more political correctness in, people tuned out.
[03:25.200 --> 03:26.640]  The show spiked up.
[03:26.640 --> 03:31.520]  It was then sliding down, plunging into oblivion.
[03:31.520 --> 03:37.920]  They activated their MKUltra, multiple personality operative, Roseanne Barb to then go into a
[03:37.920 --> 03:39.440]  complete conniption fit.
[03:39.440 --> 03:40.440]  That's really what I believe.
[03:40.440 --> 03:44.600]  I believe that she is an MKUltra mind control slave, as many people in Hollywood are, and
[03:44.600 --> 03:47.280]  that John Goodman is also a Martian robot.
[03:47.280 --> 03:54.480]  I'm being sarcastic, but when she's over there saying, I got seven personalities and I'm
[03:54.480 --> 03:58.520]  on tranquilizers, which might be true.
[03:58.520 --> 04:03.440]  It certainly opens the door.
[04:03.440 --> 04:04.920]  She says, I am large.
[04:04.920 --> 04:07.120]  I contain multitudes.
[04:07.120 --> 04:12.360]  Well, she has a personality that loves us, that says she's going to come on all the time
[04:12.360 --> 04:13.360]  and then doesn't.
[04:13.360 --> 04:16.720]  So maybe it's true or maybe she's just full of prunes.
[04:16.720 --> 04:18.920]  Roseanne says having seven personalities is tough.
[04:18.920 --> 04:24.040]  After issuing an apology, Roseanne Barb overnight slammed some of her former co-stars and retweeted
[04:24.040 --> 04:30.480]  defenses over racist comments that prompted ABC to cancel her TV series.
[04:30.480 --> 04:34.160]  Is it racist?
[04:34.160 --> 04:39.960]  Is it racist if somebody looks semming and then humans are primates to say it?
[04:39.960 --> 04:43.760]  I mean, I don't like to be a rillo in my shirt off.
[04:43.760 --> 04:45.600]  No, it's not.
[04:45.600 --> 04:47.000]  This is a political correctness.
[04:47.000 --> 04:49.040]  Is it racist to target blacks for abortion?
[04:49.040 --> 04:50.040]  Oh, yeah, that is.
[04:50.040 --> 04:51.360]  Or to ship drugs in a neighborhood?
[04:51.360 --> 04:52.360]  Oh, yeah, that is.
[04:52.360 --> 04:54.840]  I don't know if we'll ever talk about that because they're the engineers.
[04:54.840 --> 04:57.000]  By the way, China is threatening to start a war with the U.S.
[04:57.000 --> 05:01.000]  We'll tell you about that when we come back.
[05:01.000 --> 05:02.000]  I'm so excited.
[05:02.000 --> 05:08.680]  The new product at m4warslife.com in a glass bottle, two-month servings filled to the brim,
[05:08.680 --> 05:12.120]  filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[05:12.120 --> 05:17.560]  This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[05:17.560 --> 05:20.480]  But boy, does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[05:20.480 --> 05:26.520]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients,
[05:26.520 --> 05:33.160]  but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae.
[05:33.160 --> 05:36.720]  And I came up with our own formulae, working with some scientists and developers.
[05:36.720 --> 05:43.840]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone
[05:43.840 --> 05:48.960]  to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even
[05:48.960 --> 05:51.000]  make the hormones in your glands.
[05:51.000 --> 05:53.800]  It is amazing.
[05:53.800 --> 06:13.040]  Red pill now available at m4warsstore.com and your purchase of fuzzy operation.
[06:13.040 --> 06:23.040]  Changing War on Corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[06:23.040 --> 06:28.960]  Who is he?
[06:28.960 --> 06:43.000]  He's an absolute total tool of Chuck Schumer, he's a tool of Chuck Schumer and of course
[06:43.000 --> 06:51.120]  the MS-13 lover Nancy Pelosi.
[06:51.120 --> 06:57.840]  This vicious gang has transformed once peaceful, beautiful communities that I know so well.
[06:57.840 --> 07:00.080]  I know them all.
[07:00.080 --> 07:08.080]  Into blood-stained killing fields, savagely murdering, raping, and mutilating their victims.
[07:08.080 --> 07:14.360]  This is why we call the blood-thirsty MS-13 gang members exactly the name that I used
[07:14.360 --> 07:15.360]  last week.
[07:15.360 --> 07:17.360]  What was the name?
[07:17.360 --> 07:18.360]  Animals.
[07:18.360 --> 07:22.760]  But in the end, Mexico's paying for the wall.
[07:22.760 --> 07:30.680]  They make all of this money and they do absolutely nothing to stop people from going through Mexico,
[07:30.680 --> 07:35.480]  from Honduras and all these other countries, the caravan, all of this stuff.
[07:35.480 --> 07:38.680]  They do nothing to help us, nothing.
[07:38.680 --> 07:42.480]  They're going to pay for the wall and they're going to enjoy it, okay?
[07:42.480 --> 07:45.480]  They're going to enjoy it.
[07:45.480 --> 07:50.240]  The reason I opened the broadcast up with that today is the only place you'd see that
[07:50.240 --> 07:57.280]  would be either on m4wars.com or drudgerport.com or Fox News.
[07:57.280 --> 08:03.400]  It got blacked out all over the news with the Roseanne bar distractions.
[08:03.400 --> 08:10.120]  A few leftist publications picked it up, but Mexico now has opened its border specifically
[08:10.120 --> 08:17.200]  for people not to stay there, but to come here in a very aggressive military action.
[08:17.200 --> 08:23.280]  The UN admits that they're using giant, collapsing Third World populations as weapons against
[08:23.280 --> 08:29.040]  the West to fully make us capitulate to their form of government globalism, just like the
[08:29.040 --> 08:36.600]  Tamarishi, famously in the 80s, shipped in over 10,000 homeless people into a tiny county
[08:36.600 --> 08:40.600]  in Oregon so he could outvote and take over the county.
[08:40.600 --> 08:41.600]  It's the same thing.
[08:41.600 --> 08:42.880]  The Democrats admit it.
[08:42.880 --> 08:47.120]  They've got 14 states letting illegal aliens get driver's license and vote.
[08:47.120 --> 08:50.880]  The Democrats are now telling illegals to vote.
[08:50.880 --> 08:51.880]  Nobody would put up with this.
[08:51.880 --> 08:56.640]  So I opened the broadcast up that Trump is continuing to try to defend our republic.
[08:56.640 --> 09:01.160]  He's pressuring the Democrats with very, very fair immigration deals to make it easier
[09:01.160 --> 09:05.680]  to become a citizen, easier to come in if you're not a criminal, easier for people that
[09:05.680 --> 09:08.840]  actually are real dreamers and have lived here for a long time and aren't criminals
[09:08.840 --> 09:11.320]  that contribute to become citizens to be fast-tracked.
[09:11.320 --> 09:16.560]  But if you're criminals or you're MS-13 or you've got serious convictions, you are going
[09:16.560 --> 09:21.000]  to have your criminal, but whether you're from Europe or whether you're from Asia or
[09:21.000 --> 09:25.520]  whether you're from Latin America thrown out of here, the media has branded controlling
[09:25.520 --> 09:28.600]  our borders a Hispanic thing because that was the majority.
[09:28.600 --> 09:30.880]  It's now Chinese women.
[09:30.880 --> 09:36.720]  For three years running, Chinese women are the number one group here illegally week by
[09:36.720 --> 09:39.640]  week and they come here to have their babies for free.
[09:39.640 --> 09:44.360]  They fly in the last month, the government knows it, they get in a hotel, they go have
[09:44.360 --> 09:49.040]  the baby, everything's paid for, and that baby's now a U.S. citizen and gets benefits
[09:49.040 --> 09:53.080]  and it's middle-class Chinese doing it.
[09:53.080 --> 09:57.320]  It's crazy, you go to the domain in North Austin and sometimes a third of the people
[09:57.320 --> 10:00.400]  you'll see are pregnant Chinese women.
[10:00.400 --> 10:03.840]  Don't speak a lick of English and they're up there, they're shopping, they're enjoying
[10:03.840 --> 10:07.080]  themselves, they've got an apartment, they're right next to the big women's center that's
[10:07.080 --> 10:12.320]  right down the road there where my wife just had her baby a year ago and they are milking
[10:12.320 --> 10:14.600]  the systems.
[10:14.600 --> 10:21.000]  There it is, China, now the biggest group.
[10:21.000 --> 10:22.000]  So it's a joke.
[10:22.000 --> 10:25.040]  It's a joke of China and you try that.
[10:25.040 --> 10:28.920]  They will put you in a forced labor camp or they will execute you and they will take
[10:28.920 --> 10:30.520]  your organs.
[10:30.520 --> 10:35.960]  But see, just like the EU filing suit on thousands of U.S. companies claiming that we abuse
[10:35.960 --> 10:44.360]  people's data, which in many cases is true, the EU basically exempts itself and China
[10:44.360 --> 10:46.720]  hasn't had one suit filed on them.
[10:46.720 --> 10:50.520]  It's China and the EU ganged up on us and I keep going back to that because how can
[10:50.520 --> 10:53.320]  leftists not join with the fight for America?
[10:53.320 --> 11:00.760]  When everything Trump's doing is pragmatically, Eisenhower meets JFK, it's just standard
[11:00.760 --> 11:07.680]  turn the economy on, go after corruption, kick out most the lobbyists, nothing's perfect
[11:07.680 --> 11:10.720]  and just follow an economic policy that's good for the country and good for the world
[11:10.720 --> 11:15.600]  but not good for ultra-rich people worth hundreds of billions of dollars like Bezos
[11:15.600 --> 11:21.440]  and Slim and Gates and Buffett and all the rest of these people, they are above the law
[11:21.440 --> 11:26.040]  and they are at war with free economies and they are at war with the West because they
[11:26.040 --> 11:32.780]  are monopoly men and they want total consolidation.
[11:32.780 --> 11:38.360]  Trump is a renaissance guy, he's a capitalist, he is a entertainer, he is somebody that wants
[11:38.360 --> 11:45.600]  large ass and wants big, juicy economies so he can skim off the top in a legal and lawful
[11:45.600 --> 11:51.960]  way, not off some skimming to take it, you know, some business, riding in on the return
[11:51.960 --> 11:59.200]  of America, a big hit, a big cornucopia, the ghost of Christmas present, big beautiful
[11:59.200 --> 12:03.760]  orangutan but remember Bill Marr can call him an orangutan and Bill Marr is not going
[12:03.760 --> 12:09.840]  to get his show cancelled but Roseanne Barr, you can see it, they set her up, brought in
[12:09.840 --> 12:15.880]  the new show, was really an anti-conservative program, the pieces I saw of it, luring people
[12:15.880 --> 12:29.280]  in, it's simply amazing, they can call George W. Bush a chimpanzee, a monkey, over and over
[12:29.280 --> 12:34.040]  again, if you're a TV viewer we've got the meme on screen, let's go back to that, you
[12:34.040 --> 12:44.800]  got Valerie Jarrett that doesn't completely look like the chimpanzee scientist lady from
[12:44.800 --> 12:52.800]  the first excellent Charlton Heston Planet of the Apes movie, she looks more like a toad
[12:52.800 --> 12:59.840]  or a snapping turtle, more like a fish creature, now Trump doesn't really look like an orangutan
[12:59.840 --> 13:05.280]  other than the orangutan color of his hair, it's dead on back when he was just dying it
[13:05.280 --> 13:09.600]  with just for men or whatever, reportedly that's what that color is, okay yes Trump
[13:09.600 --> 13:17.640]  does make chimpanzee like or orangutan like lip faces because humans do that and they've
[13:17.640 --> 13:27.280]  got studies how humans with the same emotions make the same faces as great apes, chimpanzees,
[13:27.280 --> 13:36.200]  apes, orangutans, and you can see the comparisons they teach that in sociology, psychology, anthropology
[13:36.200 --> 13:42.680]  it's well known, so if you compare some black lady to looking simian well there's a reason
[13:42.680 --> 13:49.780]  because we are primates, that's why there's so many comparisons to humans and monkeys
[13:49.780 --> 13:55.640]  and apes because some people look more like it than others, there are some white people
[13:55.640 --> 13:58.680]  that look more like apes than other white people, there are some black people that look
[13:58.680 --> 14:06.080]  more ape like other black people, I look ape like, with my shirt off, you know in my birthday
[14:06.080 --> 14:12.640]  suit I look like a gorilla, I mean I have to work out, I've got big chest, big arms,
[14:12.640 --> 14:22.680]  big legs, I'm bow legged, my feet are flat, my dad is somewhat simian looking too, it's
[14:22.680 --> 14:29.760]  just the way it is and I'm proud of it, but I mean this whole thing is just absolutely
[14:29.760 --> 14:34.880]  ridiculous, I'm hairy like an ape too, by the way I'm proud of it, women don't seem to
[14:34.880 --> 14:46.880]  mind they seem to like it, so I would say that I look more simian than most black people,
[14:46.880 --> 14:54.260]  but this mental illness of political correctness to say that we don't all at one way or another
[14:54.260 --> 15:01.720]  look simian is just a complete joke, I mean it's like species of horses, does a mule look
[15:01.720 --> 15:05.240]  a lot like a horse, even though it's not a horse, does a donkey look a lot like a horse,
[15:05.240 --> 15:10.640]  it's a different species but it's in the same family, so if you're watching on TV you
[15:10.640 --> 15:14.560]  can see that footage they did where I did a whole joke, the old I decided I supported
[15:14.560 --> 15:21.120]  Hillary and I'm ripping my shirt off and I look simian there, but this is the mental
[15:21.120 --> 15:24.280]  illness, this is what they've pushed, this is what they've said where they can decide
[15:24.280 --> 15:28.280]  who's fired, who's taken off the air, then that sets the precedent monkey see monkey
[15:28.280 --> 15:33.000]  do where then all of us are watching television and we think oh let's reenact that in our
[15:33.000 --> 15:40.920]  own lives, it's incredible, I call my own little daughter my little monkey, she hangs
[15:40.920 --> 15:45.920]  onto my fingers and you know what she looks like a cute little pink monkey, so this is
[15:45.920 --> 15:50.200]  the mental illness ladies and gentlemen and it's out of control, so they're gonna fire
[15:50.200 --> 15:54.800]  anybody that compares white people to apes, no it's not gonna happen, they'll be back
[15:54.800 --> 16:01.760]  with Russia and China and major threats, I tried other brands but I came back to my
[16:01.760 --> 16:07.600]  sunshine, for the best hot or cold pain relief, get the best, get a sunny bay heating pad,
[16:07.600 --> 16:13.400]  sometimes life can be a pain in the neck or back or shoulder, and the best relief for
[16:13.400 --> 16:18.400]  that pain is a sunny bay heating pad, did you know that the American College of Physicians

[20:31.880 --> 20:41.840]  We're going to get a different result out of hate, why don't we just try love, we have
[20:41.840 --> 20:48.120]  the resources for a peaceful world, you know sometimes you need some crazy mother f**kers
[20:48.120 --> 20:52.560]  to change something, Steve Jobs is crazy, now we all going to see Jobs phones, they
[20:52.560 --> 20:58.080]  say trucks crazy, they say I'm crazy, but I'm here to show love, it's a bigger plan
[20:58.080 --> 21:02.880]  and I'm just doing what the universe told me.
[21:02.880 --> 21:14.760]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God, it's Alex Jones.
[21:14.760 --> 21:21.920]  I'm your host Alex Jones, coming up the next segment, I'm going to get into Senator Seek
[21:21.920 --> 21:27.200]  stronger action on China in South China Sea, China is now threatening military action against
[21:27.200 --> 21:35.680]  our ships, that means war, that is a huge issue, also Soros has thrown a big fit, everything
[21:35.680 --> 21:41.080]  has gone wrong, Soros warns major financial crisis is coming when he's the one that's
[21:41.080 --> 21:46.640]  famous for engineering financial crises and I'm also at the start of the next segment
[21:46.640 --> 21:54.960]  going to air the definitive clip of Soros on NPR and Soros on 60 Minutes and other programs
[21:54.960 --> 22:02.360]  saying the best time of his life was going around with his father while his stepfather
[22:02.360 --> 22:09.440]  rounded up the Jews and now he feels no guilt for it and then he's attacking Roseanne Barr
[22:09.440 --> 22:14.920]  for pointing it out and I think that's the real reason she got canned, now here's what
[22:14.920 --> 22:24.040]  you really need to know about Roseanne Barr, Roseanne Barr is extremely, here's what you
[22:24.040 --> 22:36.520]  need to know about Roseanne Barr, Roseanne Barr is extremely eccentric, Roseanne Barr
[22:36.520 --> 22:43.400]  was basically picked by the corporate media who have imploding ratings to come on television
[22:43.400 --> 22:54.960]  and launch a conservative quasi reboot but as soon as the show launched it began to just
[22:54.960 --> 23:01.600]  be a sucker punch or a sucker play where they lured people back into the top rated show
[23:01.600 --> 23:07.160]  to get viewers back into ABC and then they baited and switched it from the episodes
[23:07.160 --> 23:12.840]  I watched and it had more social justice warrior stuff, it had more pro open border Islamic
[23:12.840 --> 23:17.560]  crap than anything you could imagine so we praise it as this great conservative program
[23:17.560 --> 23:25.080]  and this trailblazing thing when Roseanne is the token free thinker, she's the token
[23:25.080 --> 23:30.320]  open minded person and then she's billed as a crazy person, she's billed as a substance
[23:30.320 --> 23:37.040]  abuser, she's billed as a person with multiple personalities and so we hail mainstream media
[23:37.040 --> 23:45.120]  and say thank you so much for giving us a voice in mainstream news and mainstream sitcoms,
[23:45.120 --> 23:52.040]  that's right sitcoms, let us tune into your fraud and let us buy into it and let us feel
[23:52.040 --> 23:56.960]  like we've got a seat at the table when all you're doing is laughing at us and suckering
[23:56.960 --> 24:03.240]  us and then when Roseanne gets a little bit off the reservation you ignore it but as soon
[24:03.240 --> 24:10.400]  as the ratings start to plunge from record ratings in the last four or five years for
[24:10.400 --> 24:16.440]  any other show out there to only a decent show with a trajectory showing it going straight
[24:16.440 --> 24:25.560]  down, well then the controversy you've been pushing her to engage in, well the last stage
[24:25.560 --> 24:31.680]  of the setup was brought in and ABC bragged to see an end, an article I read this morning
[24:31.680 --> 24:35.360]  that they were already looking at cancelling the show because of her activities and that
[24:35.360 --> 24:40.920]  they were proud of how quick they took action and how they flushed her so quickly because
[24:40.920 --> 24:47.160]  they're not going to put up with hate, they're going to virtue signal just like major Fortune
[24:47.160 --> 24:55.840]  100 companies like Starbucks, Starbucks is admittedly being funded by the open society
[24:55.840 --> 25:01.560]  foundation in George Soros that's the main funder of the PR group in their own press
[25:01.560 --> 25:07.120]  release along with the Ford Foundation running the whole oh we're racist we're going to close
[25:07.120 --> 25:11.760]  our doors for a few days to be a reeducation camp and then we're going to ask every white
[25:11.760 --> 25:17.480]  patron that comes in are you a racist would you virtue signal today and tell a black person
[25:17.480 --> 25:24.240]  you're sorry will you take on some guilt, this is being pushed as divide and conquer
[25:24.240 --> 25:29.800]  from the people up on the top of the pyramid to control those at the bottom of the pyramid
[25:29.800 --> 25:35.160]  it's simple it's in the WikiLeaks it's called social engineering it's called divide and
[25:35.160 --> 25:41.200]  conquer it's called Balkanization now the truth about Roseanne Barr was as soon as she
[25:41.200 --> 25:44.920]  made the statement she apologized because in the past they would let her apologize for
[25:44.920 --> 25:49.840]  publicity but this time they were ready to get rid of her yeah there it is you're watching
[25:49.840 --> 25:57.880]  on TV the Perception Institute research representation reality that means controlling reality and
[25:57.880 --> 26:03.400]  who was one of their main funders Ford Foundation and the open society foundation that's all
[26:03.400 --> 26:09.920]  divide and conquer race war garbage and so are the other organizations why are the ultra
[26:09.920 --> 26:15.960]  rich why are the super blue bloods that only marry other white people who only allow Oprah
[26:15.960 --> 26:18.760]  Winfrey into their eugenics meetings that are even in the Wall Street Journal in New
[26:18.760 --> 26:24.480]  York Times remember six years ago the world's richest meeting secret to establish a world
[26:24.480 --> 26:29.680]  government for depopulation just type in the world's richest meeting New York to discuss
[26:29.680 --> 26:37.880]  depopulation ABC News London Guardian you name it six years ago they try to coming out they
[26:37.880 --> 26:43.880]  said David Rockefeller Ted Turner Bill Gates they're all there with Oprah Winfrey the one
[26:43.880 --> 26:49.720]  black lady meeting in secret in New York and then they put out a press release admitting
[26:49.720 --> 26:54.480]  we're establishing world government and we're going to shrink your population and we're
[26:54.480 --> 26:57.240]  going to teach you how to fight with each other and we're going to bring down the first
[26:57.240 --> 27:02.800]  world because we shouldn't have a middle class only a super elite these guys all run global
[27:02.800 --> 27:07.400]  scams where they pay basically zero taxes all their money tax exempt and they get called
[27:07.400 --> 27:13.520]  philanthropist while they lecture all of us about how we're bad and how we shouldn't
[27:13.520 --> 27:18.600]  have a middle class and they also work around the clock to shut down any small businesses
[27:18.600 --> 27:22.840]  or any regional businesses or factories and deindustrialize the West to bring us to our
[27:22.840 --> 27:30.920]  knees so they can dictate to us the terms of our total surrender and then once they've
[27:30.920 --> 27:35.000]  got you under their control they can dictate inoculations they can dictate number of children
[27:35.000 --> 27:38.160]  you can have they can dictate total control but first they're going to let the third
[27:38.160 --> 27:45.040]  world population run rampant until we approve a global fascist order that will then exterminate
[27:45.040 --> 27:50.880]  with race specific bio weapons the entire third world now that's the real plan and that's
[27:50.880 --> 27:55.200]  why they hate me because I've reverse engineered their own documents their own admissions their
[27:55.200 --> 28:02.200]  own plans now if you want to stop this and you want to fight back it is absolutely critical
[28:02.200 --> 28:05.680]  that you understand what we're really dealing with here and you don't defeat these people
[28:05.680 --> 28:09.520]  by apologizing or by groveling they want to bring in a total climate of witch hunt and
[28:09.520 --> 28:15.000]  fear where we all roll over you want to stop them you spread the word you tell the truth

[33:19.640 --> 33:26.120]  thing because you see incredible suffering around you and in fact you are you're in considerable
[33:26.120 --> 33:33.800]  danger yourself but you're fourteen years old and you don't believe that it can actually
[33:33.800 --> 33:40.560]  touch you you have a belief in yourself your belief in your father it's a very happy making
[33:40.560 --> 33:45.320]  exhilarating experience while hundreds of thousands of Hungarian Jews were being shipped
[33:45.320 --> 33:51.400]  off to the death camps george soros accompanied his phony godfather on his appointed rounds
[33:51.400 --> 33:56.480]  confiscating property from the jews these are pictures from nineteen forty four of what
[33:56.480 --> 34:05.680]  happened to george soros his friends in neighbors europe hungarian jew who escaped the holocaust
[34:05.680 --> 34:16.600]  by posing as a christian and you watched lots of people get shipped off to the death camps
[34:16.600 --> 34:22.320]  right i was fourteen years old and i would say that that's when my character was made
[34:22.320 --> 34:28.520]  in what way that one should think ahead one should understand and and anticipate events
[34:28.520 --> 34:36.920]  and one one is threatened it was a tremendous threat of evil i mean it was a very personal
[34:36.920 --> 34:42.800]  experience of evil my understanding is that you went out with this protector of yours
[34:42.800 --> 34:49.680]  who swore that you were his adopted godson yes yes went out in fact and helped in the
[34:49.680 --> 34:56.240]  confiscation of property from the jews that's right yes i mean that's that sounds like an
[34:56.240 --> 35:03.880]  experience that would send lots of people to the psychiatric couch for many many years
[35:03.880 --> 35:12.400]  was it difficult not not at all not at all maybe as a child you don't you don't see
[35:12.400 --> 35:21.600]  the connection but it was it created no no problem at all no feeling of guilt no for
[35:21.600 --> 35:28.320]  example that i'm jewish and here i am watching these people go i could just as easily be
[35:28.320 --> 35:36.120]  there i should be there none of that well of course i could i could be on the other
[35:36.120 --> 35:46.960]  side or i could be the one from whom it the thing is being taken away but there was no
[35:46.960 --> 35:58.040]  sense that i shouldn't be there because that was well actually funny way it's just like
[35:58.040 --> 36:06.040]  in markets that if i weren't there of course i wasn't doing it but somebody else would
[36:06.040 --> 36:11.760]  would be taking it away anyhow it was the whether i was there or not i was only a spectator
[36:11.760 --> 36:19.240]  the property was being taken away so i had no role in taking away the property so i had
[36:19.240 --> 36:27.400]  no sense of guilt are you religious no you believe in god no you may have heard that
[36:27.400 --> 36:32.440]  starbucks is closing up shop today to implement mandatory implicit bias training the move
[36:32.440 --> 36:37.120]  will cost an estimated 12 million dollars in lost revenue and critics say that amounts
[36:37.120 --> 36:43.160]  to no more than virtue signaling what's worse experts claim that when you mandate this type
[36:43.160 --> 36:47.280]  of training it actually does more harm than good so why would starbucks go through with
[36:47.280 --> 36:52.480]  such a controversial move when it's costly and ineffective meet the perception institute
[36:52.480 --> 36:56.880]  a think tank with the goal of propping up intersectionality which is at the cornerstone
[36:56.880 --> 37:01.680]  of the liberal thought plantation here's the kicker the perception institute is supported
[37:01.680 --> 37:08.080]  by you guessed it the george soros open society foundation as well as another globalist foundation
[37:08.080 --> 37:12.280]  the ford foundation now that we're able to follow the money we can see exactly how the
[37:12.280 --> 37:17.420]  story turns the perception institute is partnered with starbucks to set the precedent for other
[37:17.420 --> 37:22.000]  companies to mandate this type of training and make it a cultural norm if this is something
[37:22.000 --> 37:26.240]  you're opposed to try supporting a local coffee shop where you can check out more reports like
[37:26.240 --> 37:34.960]  these at info wars dot com madwebber reporting and that's how it all ties together ladies
[37:34.960 --> 37:39.080]  and gentlemen if you look at who's on the board of starbucks she's also some of the
[37:39.080 --> 37:45.320]  ladies on the board with oprah wimpery's big global depopulation group oprah wimpery
[37:45.320 --> 37:51.000]  of course has been in mainstream news meeting secretly with the global eugenics board with
[37:51.000 --> 38:00.920]  david rockefeller and ted turner bill gates and others and she is for global depopulation
[38:00.920 --> 38:05.120]  and so what was roseanne's big crime well it was tweeting that george soros was a nazi
[38:05.120 --> 38:10.800]  collaborator something george soros responded to himself was false and the media dutifully
[38:10.800 --> 38:16.960]  yesterday said that he's actually a holocaust survivor well i guess he did survive the holocaust
[38:16.960 --> 38:22.560]  by being a collaborator and helping actively with his uncle roundup jews we just played
[38:22.560 --> 38:28.960]  him earlier saying it but saying he felt no guilt because it's like markets he just filled
[38:28.960 --> 38:34.560]  that slot speaking of eugenics it was thomas watson who received the highest award ever
[38:34.560 --> 38:41.840]  given during the reign of the nazis from 1933 to 1945 he won the highest award ever given
[38:41.840 --> 38:47.720]  to anyone in the rike for international business machines running the hollerith machines in
[38:47.720 --> 38:52.320]  the slave camps and in the death camps of the tattoos were numbers to track you to put
[38:52.320 --> 38:56.440]  into that how long you worked how much you'd be fed would you be right away killed or gotten
[38:56.440 --> 39:03.320]  rid of or how long you'd be worked to death that's an absolute fact and ibm now has a
[39:03.320 --> 39:08.480]  computer named thomas that is their main ai system that is running most of the hospitals
[39:08.480 --> 39:16.800]  in europe and the u.s. on their bioethics boards deciding who lives and who dies that's right
[39:16.800 --> 39:22.280]  so that's the new ai deciding who lives and who dies truth is trained in fiction that's
[39:22.280 --> 39:26.240]  your right to death is actually the government's right to kill you i'm all for somebody's right
[39:26.240 --> 39:29.840]  if they don't want to seek treatment or you know i don't want to go through pain anymore
[39:29.840 --> 39:33.960]  but this is the state coming in saying no we're going to decide who lives and who dies with
[39:33.960 --> 39:38.160]  our bioethics boards programming the computers so no one has any guilt when they kill people
[39:38.160 --> 39:44.440]  well president trump just finished minutes ago live as this is a near time signing the
[39:44.440 --> 39:50.880]  right not to write to live the right to try all these thousands of drugs and things that
[39:50.880 --> 39:55.240]  are known to help people who are terminal live longer maybe even save them those are
[39:55.240 --> 39:59.240]  being held up by the drug companies and by government trump just as he promised to innovate
[39:59.240 --> 40:04.320]  the state of the union he just innovated massively let's go to that she said that this puts the
[40:04.320 --> 40:09.640]  access in the hands of all the americans who are terminally ill some groups like the american
[40:09.640 --> 40:14.240]  cancer society have pushed against this come on some democrats have pushed against it saying
[40:14.240 --> 40:21.320]  that it puts those patients who again are terminally ill at risk the FDA may not have
[40:21.320 --> 40:25.640]  vetted american cancer society runs the cancer is about to develop the cancer viruses in
[40:25.640 --> 40:30.280]  the vaccine let's watch and listen together this is to me this is a very important moment
[40:30.280 --> 40:35.880]  a very important day been looking forward to this for a long time along with senator
[40:35.880 --> 40:40.760]  ron johnson and and i will tell you we worked hard on this i never understood why it was
[40:40.760 --> 40:46.800]  hard they've been trying to have it passed for years i never understood why because
[40:46.800 --> 40:51.120]  i'd see people friends of mine and other people i'd read about where they travel all over
[40:51.120 --> 40:57.360]  the world looking for a cure and we have the best medical people in the world but we have
[40:57.360 --> 41:03.360]  trials and we have long time 12 years 15 years even when things look really promising so
[41:03.360 --> 41:08.200]  many years and i never understood why they didn't do this and we worked very hard and
[41:08.200 --> 41:13.200]  pause please i want to thank we're gonna we're gonna come back with more of this on the other
[41:13.200 --> 41:18.880]  side because this is a near time the speech is still ongoing it is a fact that they have
[41:18.880 --> 41:23.440]  suppressed thousands of treatments i don't want to call them cures but in some cases it
[41:23.440 --> 41:29.600]  cures people and all we get is 50 year old bug poison they call it chemotherapy and then
[41:29.600 --> 41:34.240]  they suck everything out of you and the doctors aren't allowed to get the new treatments they're
[41:34.240 --> 41:40.440]  blocking it all this is this is the eugenics control the Rockefeller control it keeps going
[41:40.440 --> 41:47.120]  out the same people of our medicine and trump is breaking it all up it is amazing if you're
[41:47.120 --> 41:51.120]  already gonna die you want to take some risky treatments that's how you should develop new
[41:51.120 --> 41:56.440]  stuff let them do it but no instead the globalists take all the real stuff of themselves and very
[41:56.440 --> 42:00.840]  expensive swiss clinics and other areas and then you don't get access to it well guess
[42:00.840 --> 42:06.840]  what globalists you're not gonna hoard the life extensions to yourself watch my film
[42:06.840 --> 42:12.160]  in game i know the president's seen it i've been told that's already what's going on so
[42:12.160 --> 42:16.120]  he's not he learned it from in game he understands what's already happening and it's all about
[42:16.120 --> 42:20.760]  them suppressing new medical developments it's all happening unlocking the secrets of the
[42:20.760 --> 42:23.640]  universe everything trump promised we're gonna go to break them up with more please don't

[47:04.000 --> 47:18.000]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:18.000 --> 47:27.600]  you're listening to the antidote for fake news it's alex jones everything about globalism
[47:27.600 --> 47:32.240]  is suppressing american innovation american dominance but also ensuring that the general
[47:32.240 --> 47:36.960]  public of the world doesn't get life extension technologies doesn't get clean air conditioning
[47:36.960 --> 47:41.840]  clean cars they don't want innovation they want a post industrial world that's the official
[47:41.840 --> 47:48.520]  goal of the u n u nesco agenda 21 that's a fact member obama went to african said you
[47:48.520 --> 47:53.320]  can't have cars air conditioning he went to south america said you're gonna live in communism
[47:53.320 --> 47:58.960]  i'm not and the people are like look at any of the graduate students so i feel so good
[47:58.960 --> 48:04.740]  backing trump because you have a lot of terminally ill people in this country with thousands of
[48:04.740 --> 48:08.080]  treatments that are known to extend their lives or even save them that sometimes they
[48:08.080 --> 48:12.920]  wait 20 years and then never even approve something because they don't want americans
[48:12.920 --> 48:17.600]  having access to this and yeah people are gonna die with some of these treatments but
[48:17.600 --> 48:22.000]  they're already dying they have a right if the left says you have a right to kill yourself
[48:22.000 --> 48:29.440]  and i think if you make the decision you do but you don't the state involved but the
[48:29.440 --> 48:33.440]  larger issue is you have a right to take then whatever treatment you want you better believe
[48:33.440 --> 48:37.280]  it but they want less treatments and man i was just watching him live i gotta air this
[48:37.280 --> 48:41.560]  into the next hour because we backed up at the start he was saying americans have always
[48:41.560 --> 48:46.640]  been fighters and we never give up this is very personal to me and he went on and talked
[48:46.640 --> 48:52.120]  about that so he's the real deal folks and you know i'm being sued by the globalist
[48:52.120 --> 48:57.200]  i'm being attacked the left admits they're lying about me they're trying to shut us down
[48:57.200 --> 49:02.360]  but it's worth it for the children that we're gonna save through restricting abortion and
[49:02.360 --> 49:08.640]  we're already cut it back through through what we're doing with the right to fight they should
[49:08.640 --> 49:12.640]  have called the right to fight not just the right to try sounds like trump was to rename
[49:12.640 --> 49:16.560]  it the right to fight and they have you know the new republic of the new york times all
[49:16.560 --> 49:23.360]  this week saying alex jones is waking america up he must be silenced here's the new republic
[49:23.360 --> 49:29.680]  the legal war on alex jones and they admit the democrats are financing opinion this is
[49:29.680 --> 49:36.840]  the new york times the alex jones presidency oh they say in rolling stone it's not about
[49:36.840 --> 49:39.680]  the first amendment and they totally misrepresent what i've done and what i've said and say
[49:39.680 --> 49:42.920]  it's time that he platforming and get rid of the first amendment because nobody reads
[49:42.920 --> 49:48.440]  you anymore because you're a joke the average rolling stone article has like zero comments
[49:48.440 --> 49:53.560]  right about me it has thousands so i'm on the right side of history i'm so proud i backed
[49:53.560 --> 49:57.200]  trump i'm so proud i've been proven right he's not perfect he's not a dictator he can't
[49:57.200 --> 50:02.400]  do it all but he's the real deal and he is scaring these globals to death and so yeah
[50:02.400 --> 50:07.440]  i got mad at trump when he bombed syria again because i know the rebels did the chemical
[50:07.440 --> 50:11.720]  attack or staged it and this time they confirmed they didn't even do it it didn't happen and
[50:11.720 --> 50:15.400]  trump withdrew the funding from the white helmets after but he was putting a rock in
[50:15.400 --> 50:18.880]  a hard place and he didn't act they would have been able to launch a wider war so i
[50:18.880 --> 50:24.680]  just more and more just trust trump in my spirit in my gut but also in his action they
[50:24.680 --> 50:30.200]  don't want you have an access to technology we develop folks they got cures almost everything
[50:30.200 --> 50:34.680]  now they can definitely extend your life and they don't know how to roll this out without
[50:34.680 --> 50:38.480]  the public learning about it so that's what globalism is all about we're all fighting
[50:38.480 --> 50:43.080]  about racism while we're all getting hit with chemical and biologicals and binary weapons
[50:43.080 --> 50:47.320]  and trump knows all about it so i said the state of the union i'm gonna get that health
[50:47.320 --> 50:52.000]  care and the cures and treatments they're blocking released it's your right if you want
[50:52.000 --> 50:58.120]  to take it or not it's your right to read the insert you're already dying anyways and
[50:58.120 --> 51:02.320]  he said and we're gonna we were learning the secrets of the universe i'm getting chills
[51:02.320 --> 51:06.240]  right now he goes we're learning the secrets they already got a bunch of them he goes we're
[51:06.240 --> 51:13.280]  gonna deploy those new technology new economies get massive chills right now every time god
[51:13.280 --> 51:17.960]  knows i'm on the right track is get the chills it's like yes talk about this the innovation
[51:17.960 --> 51:24.400]  the action we're gonna take what we're doing together standing together it's a bigger plan
[51:24.400 --> 51:29.520]  like Kanye said doesn't mean there's not racism or stubs or weirdos on every front
[51:29.520 --> 51:33.960]  but it means we the people that have love to stand up for what's right or coming together
[51:33.960 --> 51:37.240]  and we see through the globalists trying to steal the future trying to steal everything
[51:37.240 --> 51:41.760]  we got so i'm gonna go back to this powerful trump speech until we're done with it in the

[52:33.560 --> 52:40.440]  to fund expand the operation we already put so much product in our supplements with other
[52:40.440 --> 52:47.040]  supplement companies mark stuff up on average seven times ours about 150 markup we do discounts
[52:47.040 --> 52:53.800]  like a 50 markup where you know you're looking at a $70 bottle there's there's $30 a product
[52:53.800 --> 53:00.280]  in that if it's something like dna force pqq coq 10 all it's very expensive ours is the
[53:00.280 --> 53:05.120]  real organically source type by that i mean it's from organic sources it's lab created
[53:05.120 --> 53:09.920]  you can't technically call it organic but it's from an organic source it's not synthetic

[53:25.480 --> 53:30.160]  expand the face of globalists but i'm not going to do that you want the best we have
[53:30.160 --> 53:33.760]  gone out and develop the best it's why they're attacking our supplements trying to demonize

[54:20.920 --> 54:28.280]  working it and it must say to the union address four months ago i called on congress to pass
[54:28.280 --> 54:36.560]  right to try it's such a great name some bills that don't have a good name but this is such
[54:36.560 --> 54:42.560]  a great name for the first day i heard it it's so perfect right to try and a lot of
[54:42.560 --> 54:50.080]  that trying is going to be successful i really believe that i really believe it so we did
[54:50.080 --> 54:56.880]  it and we went through the senate we went through the house the house had a bill the
[54:56.880 --> 55:04.120]  senate had a bill we'd go and mission together we got to go back and take votes and i said
[55:04.120 --> 55:08.400]  do me a favor tell me which is the better bill for the people not for the insurance company
[55:08.400 --> 55:12.240]  not for the pharmaceutical companies i don't care about them i really don't i couldn't
[55:12.240 --> 55:22.440]  care less they are so pissed right now folks they're blocking us for so long and that's
[55:22.440 --> 55:27.160]  the bill i won't tell you which one but i took the one that was good they said one in particular
[55:27.160 --> 55:31.200]  was great for the people not so good for the others great for the people we don't care
[55:31.200 --> 55:36.760]  about the others right now and is giving terminally ill patients the right to try experimental
[55:36.760 --> 55:45.320]  lifesaving treatments and some of these treatments are so promising and we're moving that timeline
[55:45.320 --> 55:50.440]  way up anyway beyond this we're moving it way up but it's still a process that takes
[55:50.440 --> 55:58.040]  years now it takes up to 15 years even 20 years some of these treatments are going but
[55:58.040 --> 56:05.040]  for many years patients advocates and lawmakers have fought for this fundamental freedom and
[56:05.040 --> 56:11.560]  as i said incredibly they couldn't get it and there were reasons a lot of it was business
[56:11.560 --> 56:17.800]  a lot of it was pharmaceuticals a lot of it was insurance a lot of it was liability i
[56:17.800 --> 56:23.160]  said so you take care of that stuff and that's what we did today i'm proud to keep another
[56:23.160 --> 56:36.800]  promise to the american people as i sign the right to try legislation into law they want
[56:36.800 --> 56:40.520]  to bully us that if we support the president we'll be destroyed so be it i'm not going
[56:40.520 --> 56:47.360]  to turn my back on the president if i look like that i would have been president 10 years
[56:47.360 --> 56:54.520]  earlier if i had that face if i had that head of hair i would have been president so long

[1:00:40.840 --> 1:00:46.280]  promise he's kept already he's already gotten half of what he said he'd do done in a year
[1:00:46.280 --> 1:00:51.800]  and a half unprecedented he's had about an eighty five percent accuracy rate on how he
[1:00:51.800 --> 1:00:57.960]  implemented those things a dictator couldn't execute that well dictators can't write anything
[1:00:57.960 --> 1:01:03.040]  everything falls apart i mean it's magic what trumps been able to do and yeah he's done

[1:02:23.320 --> 1:02:28.840]  put out lies about us and vote us down and they said because i exposed the chemical attacks
[1:02:28.840 --> 1:02:36.840]  that year that april with ron paul and others but i mean the rebels admitted they launched
[1:02:36.840 --> 1:02:42.200]  a chemical attack to get us in there they had the motive to but that okay fine people

[1:02:46.800 --> 1:02:51.920]  playing along with al qaeda and isaac's launching chemical attacks to go blow up another country
[1:02:51.920 --> 1:02:57.240]  protecting christians so i get more shares on the internet don't give a flip and flip

[1:03:03.680 --> 1:03:07.920]  second amendment and the family and to expose abortion i got into it to expose the eugenicist
[1:03:07.920 --> 1:03:11.880]  and the globalist i got into it to expose the whole global system and to have a better
[1:03:11.880 --> 1:03:19.920]  system i got to end things to change things not to take over the existing system now we
[1:03:19.920 --> 1:03:23.360]  got a beachhead with trump and that's why i know he's not perfect but he's getting a
[1:03:23.360 --> 1:03:29.640]  lot done and that's why i'm now a cheerleader for that beachhead and he is starting to drain
[1:03:29.640 --> 1:03:33.360]  the swamp and they are screaming they are yelling they are gnashing they are flipping
[1:03:33.360 --> 1:03:39.920]  out they are bending over backwards they don't know what to do we come back and play the

[1:04:22.280 --> 1:04:30.360]  what kills racism is inviting people over to your house to barbeque what invites racism
[1:04:30.360 --> 1:04:37.200]  what invites it is all of this hyping up constantly and banning comedy and chips on the shoulders

[1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:13.600]  Jones.
[1:07:13.600 --> 1:07:19.200]  Well ladies and gentlemen just four months ago at the state of the union Trump promised
[1:07:19.200 --> 1:07:23.600]  to fight as hard as he could to get the right to try legislation through that they've tried
[1:07:23.600 --> 1:07:29.080]  to get through for decades to allow people who are terminally ill to try experimental
[1:07:29.080 --> 1:07:35.000]  treatments before they've been approved some are totally safe some are very very dangerous
[1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:39.640]  many hundreds have already been approved in other countries but big US drug companies
[1:07:39.640 --> 1:07:44.040]  that have the patents on deadly chemotherapy and other bug poison where they charge you
[1:07:44.040 --> 1:07:49.560]  thousand dollars per treatment for something that cost them 30 cents they don't want competition
[1:07:49.560 --> 1:07:55.960]  they want to cut and burn Americans they want to make sure they can kill you slow not the
[1:07:55.960 --> 1:08:00.520]  doctors but the big pharma and the big control arms like Bayer that knowingly shipped out
[1:08:00.520 --> 1:08:05.760]  HIV and hepatitis blood over a million hemophiliacs and Monsanto who's merging with them who's
[1:08:05.760 --> 1:08:12.880]  even more evil well now Trump is keeping that promise again the right to fight again at
[1:08:12.880 --> 1:08:17.040]  the left once everybody be able to commit suicide and have state sponsored systems killing
[1:08:17.040 --> 1:08:21.720]  old people that's what right to die is it's the state's right to kill you well then don't
[1:08:21.720 --> 1:08:27.000]  people have a right then to go out and take an experimental treatment if they're already
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:34.880]  dying the governments around the world that are left is controlled are trying to make
[1:08:34.880 --> 1:08:39.000]  it where if someone just doesn't want to live because they're depressed they can kill themselves
[1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:45.560]  okay well then does someone have a right then if they're dying to fight for their life oh
[1:08:45.560 --> 1:08:50.080]  no the left all over the US and all over the world they fight against this because they
[1:08:50.080 --> 1:08:54.840]  want governmental control of health care and to decide what you get because their control
[1:08:54.840 --> 1:09:01.560]  freaks Donald Trump is a progress freak Donald Trump's got a bigger plan Donald Trump's part
[1:09:01.560 --> 1:09:07.480]  of the bigger plan Kanye's talking about we're all part of that bigger plan unlocking the
[1:09:07.480 --> 1:09:12.120]  secrets of the universe so he just signed it a few minutes ago here's President Trump
[1:09:12.120 --> 1:09:20.440]  the promised keeper four months ago we also believe that patients with terminal conditions
[1:09:20.440 --> 1:09:29.200]  terminal illness should have access to experimental treatment immediately that could potentially
[1:09:29.200 --> 1:09:36.200]  save their lives people who are terminally ill should not have to go from country to
[1:09:36.200 --> 1:09:44.360]  country to seek a cure I want to give them a chance right here at home it's time for
[1:09:44.360 --> 1:09:56.440]  Congress to give these wonderful incredible Americans the right to try yes now it's long
[1:09:56.440 --> 1:10:00.640]  and already the big pharma and the big insurance companies the ones that gave you obama care
[1:10:00.640 --> 1:10:05.520]  the double and triple your prices thank god you're so dumb gruber said they're all Obama's
[1:10:05.520 --> 1:10:08.240]  guys said you're dumb thank god you're so dumb I don't think you're dumb Trump doesn't
[1:10:08.240 --> 1:10:13.920]  think you're dumb in fact I saw Trump in a speech last week I meant to give the clip
[1:10:13.920 --> 1:10:17.400]  he said you know there are a lot of smart Americans you know I think Americans are smarter
[1:10:17.400 --> 1:10:21.040]  than some people say they are you know I think if we treat them like they're smart we put
[1:10:21.040 --> 1:10:25.680]  out information and have a real debate I think we'll turn the country around he totally gets
[1:10:25.680 --> 1:10:31.480]  the enemy's attitude and more and more I watch Trump and it's magic man he's got it and
[1:10:31.480 --> 1:10:36.440]  they wonder how he'll say the same thing I say the same day even simultaneously sometimes
[1:10:36.440 --> 1:10:39.840]  or how I predicted the New York Times came to me on the inauguration day and they said
[1:10:39.840 --> 1:10:43.720]  how did you predict he'd talk about bringing God back into America in the Covenant he'd
[1:10:43.720 --> 1:10:47.840]  talk about unlocking secret technology and the New York Times guy right there as I was
[1:10:47.840 --> 1:10:55.720]  leaving the inauguration he was waiting outside you know the VIP area and he said he said
[1:10:55.720 --> 1:10:58.280]  how did you know that you talked to the president today did somebody give you the speech and
[1:10:58.280 --> 1:11:03.520]  I said no we're synced up and that New York Times guy he wrote a big hit piece he's went
[1:11:03.520 --> 1:11:10.200]  he took a deep breath he kind of shook because you get it because you're synced up with your
[1:11:10.200 --> 1:11:14.800]  people screwing everybody over running your scams telling people how good you are when
[1:11:14.800 --> 1:11:19.520]  you're not you're in a bunch of broken weak people and that's why you hate everybody
[1:11:19.520 --> 1:11:24.640]  because scum like you wants to see everybody else suffer you rats you seek out their power
[1:11:24.640 --> 1:11:29.560]  because you don't have any innate power in your soul well we're getting you off our
[1:11:29.560 --> 1:11:33.960]  backs and you could feel it metaphysically and so I'm happy to be persecuted by you
[1:11:33.960 --> 1:11:38.200]  people because no matter what happens to me in the end we are going to defeat you and
[1:11:38.200 --> 1:11:42.800]  you know it all right let's let's go back to his speech to say for the next and I promise
[1:11:42.800 --> 1:11:49.920]  I'm going to load a phone line here it is what do you think on health care have great
[1:11:49.920 --> 1:11:54.040]  health care we got rid of the individual mandate without that we couldn't be doing what we're
[1:11:54.040 --> 1:12:00.760]  doing in a few weeks that we we're going to have great inexpensive but really good health
[1:12:00.760 --> 1:12:10.120]  care and we have two plans coming out we also have through our great secretary of labor
[1:12:10.120 --> 1:12:16.600]  we have a great plan coming out and that's through associations and so we have two plans
[1:12:16.600 --> 1:12:20.840]  coming out oh hit pause again for the most part do you have any idea what this is going
[1:12:20.840 --> 1:12:23.960]  to health care costs they're going to plunge because they're blocking so many other alternative
[1:12:23.960 --> 1:12:27.520]  treatments just calling them experimental never even letting me get to the process for over
[1:12:27.520 --> 1:12:32.800]  a decade of being tested the big farm I wrote these laws do this okay nobody else puts up
[1:12:32.800 --> 1:12:40.400]  with us and now this is going to be a whole new boom in the economy prices will go down
[1:12:40.400 --> 1:12:44.920]  choices will go up and there'll be all these new treatment centers and all this new stuff
[1:12:44.920 --> 1:12:50.640]  and all these new choices and then people rating what worked for them and then synergistically
[1:12:50.640 --> 1:12:54.720]  the good treatments will get more support and our medicine will become good again and not
[1:12:54.720 --> 1:13:03.320]  eugenics based run by AI computers from IBM named after the top Nazi the top Nazi Hitler
[1:13:03.320 --> 1:13:11.720]  said above him he was given like the quadruple eagle with look up the award Thomas Watson
[1:13:11.720 --> 1:13:17.440]  got from Hitler I know it's the highest award ever given in the third Reich and that's who's
[1:13:17.440 --> 1:13:25.880]  going to run our health care no you will not but again they've got captive audiences don't
[1:13:25.880 --> 1:13:33.920]  they they got captive audiences like our VA and poor people and the and the national
[1:13:33.920 --> 1:13:40.640]  health service in England now run by Thomas the demon computer Thomas Watson you cannot
[1:13:40.640 --> 1:13:45.800]  make this stuff up now but oh there's Nazis everywhere although average white persons
[1:13:45.800 --> 1:13:50.200]  Nazis oh somebody says a lady looks like an ape is because they're racist no she looks
[1:13:50.200 --> 1:14:00.240]  like a fish here let's go back let's go back to Trump here this here gotten tremendous
[1:14:00.240 --> 1:14:07.720]  could have done a little bit easier but somebody decided not to vote for us so it's one of
[1:14:07.720 --> 1:14:13.160]  those things I want to thank secretary Azar and I want to thank commissioner Gottlieb
[1:14:13.160 --> 1:14:23.440]  where's Scott Scott stand up I like this I like those stops and Scott let me ask you
[1:14:23.440 --> 1:14:28.560]  so it takes years and years to get this approved right you're bringing down beyond this you're
[1:14:28.560 --> 1:14:35.960]  bringing down that period of time what is the average time now it takes for you know a major
[1:14:35.960 --> 1:14:40.400]  a major medicine or cure what's the average time it takes to go through the system and
[1:14:40.400 --> 1:14:48.920]  get an approval three to seven and some go long over ten right and you're bringing that
[1:14:48.920 --> 1:14:53.800]  down you're trying to bring that down you know for safety very good and you in particular
[1:14:53.800 --> 1:14:58.040]  you're very happy with this aren't you you have a lot of good things in the wings that
[1:14:58.040 --> 1:15:06.960]  frankly if you moved them up a lot of people would have a great shot right right that's
[1:15:06.960 --> 1:15:10.880]  fantastic well thank you Scott we're very proud of you doing by the way you know why
[1:15:10.880 --> 1:15:14.360]  Trump is obsessed with this too he knows what other rich people have access to he knows
[1:15:14.360 --> 1:15:20.480]  what he has access to and he knows what they've gotten Thailand they've got in Switzerland
[1:15:20.480 --> 1:15:26.720]  what they've got in other areas that is just unbelievable and he also knows that he's the
[1:15:26.720 --> 1:15:31.080]  president and so over at the naval center and at the other places where he gets health
[1:15:31.080 --> 1:15:40.560]  care and those special wings oh boy do they have some stuff he knows all about it so that's
[1:15:40.560 --> 1:15:45.280]  what's going on this is breaking free folks technology for the people I'm gonna finish

[1:20:49.040 --> 1:20:53.840]  the fda under democrat and globalist control has been trying to shut down people even getting
[1:20:53.840 --> 1:20:58.480]  regular supplements how the e use been trying to lower the amount of vitamin c and stuff you
[1:20:58.480 --> 1:21:03.440]  need how they took the iodine out of the salt and they put the bad halogen in the water fluoride
[1:21:04.640 --> 1:21:09.200]  i mean it's just diabolical and then you read the documents how they're trying to make us dumb
[1:21:09.200 --> 1:21:14.240]  and stupid and weak and and so just like they're blocking good medicines and good drugs from us
[1:21:14.240 --> 1:21:16.080]  and good treatments that have around for decades
[1:21:18.720 --> 1:21:22.400]  and then keeping prices up they're going after the supplements as well
[1:21:22.400 --> 1:21:25.760]  don't keep them from that get the best supplements out there from our research

[1:21:46.000 --> 1:21:51.200]  the right to try hey if the left says you are allowed to kill yourself even if you're not sick
[1:21:51.200 --> 1:21:58.160]  why are they so against the right to try new medicines man just like the national health
[1:21:58.160 --> 1:22:03.120]  service i watch preventative questions on c span and they always ask questions about

[1:33:32.800 --> 1:33:39.280]  the promise of america is truly coming back the idea that we built upon that made it the greatest
[1:33:39.280 --> 1:33:45.280]  nation on earth that people from across the planet around the globe aspired to come to and be part of
[1:33:46.320 --> 1:33:51.200]  and now president trump four months after promising to get the right to try
[1:33:51.200 --> 1:33:57.120]  act through congress has signed it showed that big pharma who's been lobbying against it cannot
[1:33:57.120 --> 1:34:04.560]  continue to block promising treatments to people that are terminally ill this will accelerate
[1:34:04.560 --> 1:34:10.080]  many incredible treatments for everybody else this is true innovation the left of course has said
[1:34:10.080 --> 1:34:14.480]  let everybody have the right to commit suicide let the state decide if they can get rid of you
[1:34:14.480 --> 1:34:19.440]  if you're not needed like the netherlands on national tv has a down syndrome man on and explains
[1:34:19.440 --> 1:34:26.480]  how he needs to commit suicide this is the sickness of these people but oh the liberals oh the the
[1:34:26.480 --> 1:34:32.800]  mother jones is in the cnn's oh people might get hurt in these treatments it's their free will isn't
[1:34:32.800 --> 1:34:40.800]  it that's what it's all about isn't it so trump here's the powerful video says america has always
[1:34:40.800 --> 1:34:45.840]  been about fighters before he signs the historic legislation that's just happened minutes ago
[1:34:45.840 --> 1:34:50.560]  and they're going to write to your phone calls here it is ladies and gentlemen america has always
[1:34:50.560 --> 1:34:55.600]  been a nation of fighters who never give up here it is to receive a treatment
[1:34:55.600 --> 1:35:03.760]  now with the passage of this bill americans will be able to seek cures right here at home
[1:35:04.880 --> 1:35:12.400]  close to their family and their loved ones we are finally giving these wonderful americans
[1:35:12.400 --> 1:35:30.480]  the right to try so important america has always been a nation of fighters who never give up right
[1:35:30.480 --> 1:35:37.840]  we never give up ever right never give up we're fighters like the amazing patients and families
[1:35:37.840 --> 1:35:44.640]  here today now as i proudly signed and this is very personal for me but as i proudly sign
[1:35:45.360 --> 1:35:52.240]  this bill thousands of terminally ill americans will finally have the help the hope
[1:35:53.360 --> 1:36:00.400]  and the fighting chance and i think it's going to be better than chance that they will be cured
[1:36:00.400 --> 1:36:10.640]  that they will be helped that they'll be able to be with their families for a long time or
[1:36:10.640 --> 1:36:18.000]  maybe just for a longer time that's right but we're able to give them the absolute best
[1:36:18.000 --> 1:36:27.840]  as to what we have at this current moment at this current second and now we're going to help a lot
[1:36:27.840 --> 1:36:36.880]  of people and that will raise a lot of people so it's an honor to be signing this and if if i might
[1:36:36.880 --> 1:36:43.280]  i think i'll present i think i have to do this run i have to present this good-looking guy with
[1:36:43.280 --> 1:36:50.240]  the first pen is that okay you don't mind right okay good i'm gonna do that all trump does all
[1:36:50.240 --> 1:37:06.560]  day his classes test boy the left takes this they're just all vicious greedy hateful people
[1:37:07.680 --> 1:37:11.840]  remember all the clips we could play of bill gates kid i'm telling teachers unions
[1:37:12.720 --> 1:37:16.560]  if we don't give an old lady treatment that's 10 teachers we can hire and they're all rubbing their
[1:37:16.560 --> 1:37:21.280]  hands together to the united states who has laid out when you build up higher quality economies
[1:37:21.280 --> 1:37:26.720]  that everybody does better that's called civilization when you demand higher standards but in the new
[1:37:26.720 --> 1:37:31.120]  globalist system we're supposed to live under austerity this is so critical this is so historic
[1:37:31.120 --> 1:37:35.200]  what's happened okay we're going to your phone calls you have another amazing guest joining us
[1:37:35.200 --> 1:37:39.520]  but i'm gonna get to all your calls here ali alexander getting into rosa and the war on free
[1:37:39.520 --> 1:37:45.920]  speech that that amazing individual he's coming up let's go to your phone calls right now thank
[1:37:45.920 --> 1:37:53.760]  you for holding chris in virginia you're welcome to join us thank you i just wanted to talk about
[1:37:54.720 --> 1:38:00.320]  why it was important for trump to wait the year two and year one he wasn't gonna be able to get
[1:38:00.320 --> 1:38:05.360]  anything done because he didn't have the power of the government now i say he's still at about 40
[1:38:05.360 --> 1:38:11.680]  percent but it gives him the opportunity to actually put pressure on big farm because that's where
[1:38:11.680 --> 1:38:17.840]  it a lot of the swamp is your thought i think didn't you call in about a year ago and you said
[1:38:17.840 --> 1:38:23.360]  just give trump a chance watch what he does year two oh yeah oh yeah yeah that was me well i think
[1:38:23.360 --> 1:38:27.760]  what you said is what we should listen to because you were right he's i mean it's just what you said
[1:38:27.760 --> 1:38:33.920]  as he gets more power under the constitution as he finally gets through you see exponentially it
[1:38:33.920 --> 1:38:40.400]  gets better it gives me chills yeah i definitely think that we're on the right path and we're on
[1:38:40.400 --> 1:38:46.560]  the right track you just kind of get if people are impatient you know they're all very impatient with
[1:38:46.560 --> 1:38:52.000]  trump you know the drain in the swamp takes time it's a lot 50 some years or more and i'm just saying
[1:38:52.000 --> 1:38:57.440]  that as throwing it out there 50 plus years of corruption you try going up against a whole system
[1:38:57.440 --> 1:39:02.960]  that's corrupt like that it would it will probably be depression and draining so i you have to
[1:39:02.960 --> 1:39:08.320]  mark i was about to say just what they've done to me the media tried to come take my kids uh they've
[1:39:08.320 --> 1:39:13.280]  got george soros hillary all of them suing me uh and i'm not complaining but let me tell you i
[1:39:13.280 --> 1:39:17.520]  couldn't imagine being trump what they do to him and his family exactly i mean this is a war this is
[1:39:17.520 --> 1:39:22.240]  real let me tell you i've never felt one one hundred the heat i've gotten support and trump
[1:39:22.240 --> 1:39:27.760]  from the sides of evil that lets you know that these for real and the second thing i just wanted
[1:39:27.760 --> 1:39:34.000]  to say i just wanted to let you know that i think that a lot of people cannot understand
[1:39:34.000 --> 1:39:40.000]  why alex jones gets the intel that he does i think it even uh makes some of the people that you have
[1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:45.520]  on with you a little bit jealous of even though they're smart people but you have to stay dedicated
[1:39:45.520 --> 1:39:50.160]  to trump because i think you're the key in the bringing a lot of outside people that normally
[1:39:50.160 --> 1:39:54.880]  wouldn't dig trump or get down with trump bring them across the even just pay attention a little
[1:39:54.880 --> 1:40:00.160]  bit to what he's doing well the enemy has figured that out i didn't think i was that important but
[1:40:00.160 --> 1:40:04.800]  they are legitimately saying bring down jones we'll have trump and i think it's only because
[1:40:04.800 --> 1:40:09.680]  like you said we put out the counter talking points that are true that counter veiled their lies
[1:40:10.240 --> 1:40:15.600]  and then and then other people pick up in talk radio and the internet what we're saying and so
[1:40:15.600 --> 1:40:20.240]  they kind of see us as the epicenter not just me but the whole info wars operation so it that's
[1:40:20.240 --> 1:40:23.440]  why i'm telling listeners what you're saying is absolutely true your hopes your prayers your
[1:40:23.440 --> 1:40:28.640]  support is is critical uh because let me tell you they are coming after us and whatever happens i'm
[1:40:28.640 --> 1:40:34.320]  i'm okay with it but i tell you i i really don't want them to win because i know we're going to
[1:40:34.320 --> 1:40:38.880]  win in the end it's just that i may not do too well at the end of the equation and that's what
[1:40:38.880 --> 1:40:43.680]  i asked for you know i prayed for god to put me in a position to take these people on but i thought
[1:40:43.680 --> 1:40:48.880]  it'd be in some small junior bush league way i didn't ever envision it would be at this level
[1:40:50.240 --> 1:40:55.760]  think of it this way you're doing a great service to your grandkids down the road
[1:40:55.760 --> 1:41:03.200]  absolutely god bless you appreciate you man yeah it's uh i told people i'm not whining it's just
[1:41:03.200 --> 1:41:07.600]  let me tell you i used i knew the globals were evil but let me tell you i really know now
[1:41:09.200 --> 1:41:14.880]  and and when i say they're out to get you i mean they're just bad people folks they're really evil
[1:41:14.880 --> 1:41:20.960]  people thank you chris god bless you who's been holding the next longest here uh let's go ahead
[1:41:20.960 --> 1:41:25.680]  and talk to michael in louisiana go ahead michael you're on the air thanks for holding
[1:41:27.360 --> 1:41:36.960]  thank you mr alex jones uh i want to send you a bit of appreciation for your generosity and
[1:41:36.960 --> 1:41:45.680]  if you'd accept it i've made a design uh for a t-shirt it's a we are all tony robinson now t
[1:41:45.680 --> 1:41:52.240]  design it's very simple black and white but very very elegant it's funny you say that i thought
[1:41:52.240 --> 1:41:55.440]  about that this week because that's you know pretty much a common sense deal we should have
[1:41:55.440 --> 1:42:00.320]  shirts that we're all trump now we're all tony robinson now we're all alex jones now because
[1:42:00.320 --> 1:42:04.640]  the people really want to put themselves out there to meet good people but also be persecuted
[1:42:04.640 --> 1:42:09.200]  to see what it's like i think those are three great shirts that we should immediately have produced
[1:42:09.200 --> 1:42:16.000]  well the designs are on the way i'm uh in the process of selling sending them to owen he seems
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:20.960]  to be very good at answering his looking at his email kevin figured this out you're speaking to

[1:47:29.840 --> 1:47:35.840]  you're listening to the alex jones show we're going right back to your phone calls but matt
[1:47:35.840 --> 1:47:40.480]  drudge has made another really really good point i remember seeing this this morning and even
[1:47:41.040 --> 1:47:47.840]  split second thinking man i ought to read the side effects of ambian but sure enough drudge
[1:47:47.840 --> 1:47:52.880]  did it the company mocked rozan saying how dare you say in the middle of the night you were kind
[1:47:52.880 --> 1:47:58.240]  of out of it so your filter was gone and so now she says oh you can't forgive me oh i'm so horrible
[1:47:58.800 --> 1:48:04.640]  what cuz you called a lady that looked like a fish said she looked like a monkey i mean it's
[1:48:04.640 --> 1:48:10.720]  just everybody called trump monkeys and apes and everything else it's ridiculous it's absolutely
[1:48:10.720 --> 1:48:16.080]  ridiculous but she's all groveling to him but drudge it's an article on info wars dot com
[1:48:16.080 --> 1:48:23.120]  drudge highlights ambian side effects after company mocks rozan sleep aid claims not responsible
[1:48:23.120 --> 1:48:29.360]  for sitcom stars racism i remember a few years ago an asian man with no criminal record for no
[1:48:29.360 --> 1:48:34.480]  reason was walking around in a trance shooting at people and shot a cop in walmart in austin
[1:48:34.480 --> 1:48:41.520]  and i remember saying on air i bet he was on something like ambian because i've known people
[1:48:41.520 --> 1:48:45.440]  that i've worked with let's just say that that are really nice who woke up in the middle of the night
[1:48:45.440 --> 1:48:52.320]  on ambian and we're just walking down the street naked i mean you just totally can black out on it
[1:48:52.320 --> 1:48:58.560]  and and and that's what the insert says so she blames it on that she blames it on multiple
[1:48:58.560 --> 1:49:03.120]  personalities whatever the psychotropic drugs and they make a joke so what does drudge do we've got
[1:49:03.120 --> 1:49:07.600]  a link to it on info wars dot com he tweeted it but we have a list of them vomiting diarrhea
[1:49:08.240 --> 1:49:13.520]  impaired vision slow breathing memory loss disorientation depression suicidal thoughts
[1:49:13.520 --> 1:49:20.000]  anxiety insomnia nightmares confusion dizziness aggression addiction withdrawal which can be
[1:49:20.000 --> 1:49:29.440]  life threatening it just goes on and on and on oh but the company that makes it says people of all
[1:49:29.440 --> 1:49:34.240]  races religions and nationalities work on it every day and improve the lives of people around the
[1:49:34.240 --> 1:49:41.360]  world so there's no rozan ha you're crazy so yeah the very big pharma that doesn't want all these
[1:49:41.360 --> 1:49:44.800]  other better treatments coming out that doesn't want you to have choices they're the ones that
[1:49:44.800 --> 1:49:49.200]  want to tell you that ambience really great or wonderful i've never taken ambian i don't like
[1:49:49.200 --> 1:49:54.640]  pills i barely even take you know ad-vill well i've got a spring ankle or whatever but i can
[1:49:54.640 --> 1:50:01.520]  tell you right now that i've talked to people who are well-meaning people in society how they say
[1:50:01.520 --> 1:50:06.320]  oh yeah no i've blacked out on ambian or i first got my ambian prescription drank one beer and
[1:50:06.320 --> 1:50:15.360]  didn't know who i was for six hours it's hard core stuff so there you go ladies and gentlemen
[1:50:15.360 --> 1:50:19.440]  that's up on info wars dot com an important article if you know somebody on ambian get that out to
[1:50:19.440 --> 1:50:26.320]  them especially okay uncle sam and louisiana you were uh going to say 5g rozan a smokescreen ie drudge
[1:50:26.320 --> 1:50:33.440]  i go ahead oh yeah you were right on you i think this is all a beard of course the whole racism
[1:50:33.440 --> 1:50:41.280]  thing because yesterday who's speaking of matt roge the headline up that i saw was her talking
[1:50:41.280 --> 1:50:47.760]  about the 5g that was the main headline so it was that because that fits in with the eugenics program
[1:50:47.760 --> 1:50:51.840]  that's right you can't have her talking about about soros you can't have her talking about
[1:50:51.840 --> 1:50:56.400]  saying he's an osc laboratory when he admittedly was in his own words you can't have any of that
[1:50:56.400 --> 1:51:01.600]  you can't ever talk about 5g when she's the number one tv star that's it that's why so it's a beard
[1:51:01.600 --> 1:51:06.880]  it's just it's a shiny keys here the shiny keys folks will come here get you all fighting talking
[1:51:06.880 --> 1:51:13.920]  about the definition of comedy and racism and what is you know what is humor and why do you think
[1:51:13.920 --> 1:51:19.760]  george soros is the main funder in their own press release of the starbucks you're going there to get
[1:51:19.760 --> 1:51:28.000]  coffee not to hear about how you're racist exactly now we know what this is the people on the street
[1:51:28.000 --> 1:51:33.280]  and what it is i'm talking every day i wish i would have had that oh last week i spoke this this
[1:51:33.280 --> 1:51:39.360]  video is the congresswoman's daughter she's a congresswoman from uh colorado her husband
[1:51:39.360 --> 1:51:46.560]  is the chief the head chief of fort bragg medical facility now finally you know then of course i go
[1:51:46.560 --> 1:51:50.960]  home the next day and you're talking about what's in the in the veterans if i'd known that the day
[1:51:50.960 --> 1:51:57.280]  before it's still a good video i still have to put up a video i talked two days ago to a uh interrogator
[1:51:57.280 --> 1:52:04.880]  a senior interrogator in a for terrorists in afghanistan at the largest facility they have
[1:52:04.880 --> 1:52:10.480]  over there and he told me about how many more terrorists that are in there now since trump
[1:52:10.480 --> 1:52:17.760]  has got in what's going on there so the reaction of the people on the street no they know i mean
[1:52:18.800 --> 1:52:23.920]  twice people from talking to from around the world especially and there's hours of everybody on
[1:52:23.920 --> 1:52:27.280]  your youtube channel a lot of times you live stream you give people your youtube channels
[1:52:27.280 --> 1:52:36.880]  address uncle sam yeah it's it's my name michael d barry di capital b a r i but the easiest way to
[1:52:36.880 --> 1:52:43.200]  get there now is the latest video i put up is americans talk tommy oh yeah just real bravely
[1:52:43.200 --> 1:52:47.680]  i said you're you're great but i don't get other callers uh what did uh what's their view on tommy
[1:52:47.680 --> 1:52:54.640]  robinson being disappeared for reporting on giant pedophile uh trials well but oddly enough two
[1:52:54.640 --> 1:53:02.320]  scottish people that ran into were very negative on tommy and but the other people the other people
[1:53:02.320 --> 1:53:08.320]  of course were appalled by the censorship that was going on yeah you know it's funny the scott's
[1:53:08.320 --> 1:53:13.840]  fought the hardest against tyranny historically in europe and now i've seen the statistics they are
[1:53:13.840 --> 1:53:18.560]  the biggest socialists the biggest anti-free speech people on average a lot of great scott's
[1:53:18.560 --> 1:53:25.120]  that's very shameful what's been done to the scott's shocked by the reaction of these two
[1:53:25.120 --> 1:53:30.400]  different scottish guys i spoke to i mean they sounded like the biggest social justice warriors
[1:53:30.400 --> 1:53:35.680]  like i so they thought it was a great idea to throw people in jail that report on giant muslim
[1:53:35.680 --> 1:53:41.600]  kidnapping rings oh i hammered them i said how do you even justify what you're talking about
[1:53:41.600 --> 1:53:46.560]  i mean that they know because you drive a lot of kinship with with what tommy robinson i'm on the
[1:53:46.560 --> 1:53:52.800]  street too i'm i'm right there on the front line it's but you know tommy's got bigger balls
[1:53:52.800 --> 1:53:57.760]  that i do he's he's you know he was into the bad neighborhoods i'm out there in the middle of a
[1:53:57.760 --> 1:54:02.160]  tourist area so you know it's a bit different well you're a big guy too but i don't mean you
[1:54:02.160 --> 1:54:06.640]  haven't had leftist threaten you uh so we might have to actually play that later we have time
[1:54:06.640 --> 1:54:11.360]  put that video back on screen for me thanks guys um it's tommy robinson versus the scottish is
[1:54:11.360 --> 1:54:20.400]  that it uh well the one yeah tommy robinson versus the scottish that's one the other one below that
[1:54:20.400 --> 1:54:27.360]  is um we're all tommy robinson now that was the first one i posted a few a couple of days ago
[1:54:27.360 --> 1:54:32.160]  but listen we were synced up i think i meant to put a t-shirt out like that and then i was
[1:54:32.160 --> 1:54:35.920]  intended to give some of the proceeds to tommy so i'll say it now we're gonna print that shirt
[1:54:35.920 --> 1:54:39.440]  only take a week we'll get the ad up today we never do stuff back order but we'll say
[1:54:39.440 --> 1:54:43.360]  back order to expect it you know two weeks or so we're gonna print it now we'll get we're all
[1:54:43.360 --> 1:54:48.720]  tommy robinson now and and i've got to do it for me too because they're all attacking me now
[1:54:48.720 --> 1:54:53.760]  we're all alex jones now and we're all donald trump now but that's like i am spartagus when they came
[1:54:54.400 --> 1:54:57.840]  to the rebel leader who just overthrown most of the romans they finally defeated him
[1:54:57.840 --> 1:55:01.360]  they said we want spartagus we want to torture him to death he was already crucified under another
[1:55:01.360 --> 1:55:06.640]  name on the road to rome and they also said i'm spartagus i'm spartagus so that's the attitude
[1:55:06.640 --> 1:55:10.640]  you're not going to intimidate us you're not going to bully us but yeah send us your design and we
[1:55:10.640 --> 1:55:14.320]  might print that one up too but that's a great idea i'm getting on it right now you're a genius
[1:55:14.320 --> 1:55:19.040]  god bless you uncle sam he's got such a great youtube channel every time i come across it okay
[1:55:19.040 --> 1:55:23.520]  so i go to all your calls here i'm trying to be a good boy uh let's go to and hold the longest here
[1:55:24.160 --> 1:55:28.240]  kevin and then john uh let's go to kevin in florida you're on the air then john
[1:55:30.480 --> 1:55:35.600]  thank you so much alex i just want to make two quick points uh the first being the the total
[1:55:35.600 --> 1:55:43.360]  hypocrisy of the brain dead ignorant left with this ridiculous rosa and bar tweet um where was the
[1:55:43.360 --> 1:55:49.760]  left at when joy bayer openly praised that trump tower was on fire and that she hoped the president
[1:55:49.760 --> 1:55:54.880]  was in there burning with the other people what where were they on that people need to wake up to
[1:55:54.880 --> 1:56:00.320]  these these tactics they've done cartoons as me as the gorilla i think it's funny they've done
[1:56:00.320 --> 1:56:04.400]  trump as an orangutan and they did bush over and over again is it chimpanzee because he kind of
[1:56:04.400 --> 1:56:10.400]  looked like one well that's all fine and good because that was from the liberal perspective so
[1:56:10.400 --> 1:56:19.440]  you know do do not to unto us as i say so i just people just need to wake up to what's going on
[1:56:19.440 --> 1:56:25.440]  because sooner or later we're gonna wake up one day uh and we're gonna be in a worse trance
[1:56:25.440 --> 1:56:29.680]  and we're gonna be like britain where if you criticize anybody they're gonna throw you in jail
[1:56:29.680 --> 1:56:33.360]  this is a process they've they've already got it in most of europe they've got it in england
[1:56:33.360 --> 1:56:37.120]  they're cut they said they want to set the precedent of lying about me in the news
[1:56:37.120 --> 1:56:40.960]  shutting down my speech to shut everybody else's down since you mentioned this it's a great point
[1:56:40.960 --> 1:56:45.920]  go ahead and stay there here again here's bill mar calling uh you know trump the product of an
[1:56:45.920 --> 1:56:52.400]  orangutan here it is and finally new rule now that he's suing me for five million dollars because
[1:56:52.960 --> 1:56:56.480]  he says he's proved that he is not the love child of an orangutan
[1:56:56.480 --> 1:57:07.120]  Donald trump must learn two things what a joke is and what a contract is uh i agree and the left
[1:57:07.120 --> 1:57:13.840]  should figure that out too last point kevin uh and then the other point was uh just have you seen
[1:57:13.840 --> 1:57:18.800]  this new uh active shooter game i believe the daily mail has it where i did see it it's a
[1:57:18.800 --> 1:57:24.320]  perfect trainer for mental patients to go and shoot schools up it's just incredible because
[1:57:24.320 --> 1:57:29.920]  some of the comments on here are saying that some of the hallways resemble columbine parkland and uh
[1:57:30.640 --> 1:57:36.080]  and uh the the place in stanifate texas so just it's it's totally incredible what's going on here
[1:57:36.080 --> 1:57:42.320]  man it really is a living twilight zone absolutely 100 of the mass shooters is obsessed with shoot

[2:00:38.720 --> 2:00:45.280]  air worldwide go ahead hello alex jones i am actually thrilled in fact i've got goosebumps
[2:00:45.280 --> 2:00:50.240]  talking to you i've just got my info wars hat thank you for the bumper stickers they were being
[2:00:50.240 --> 2:00:56.480]  well received up here in upstate pa thank you sir thank you sir uh what i'd like to point out
[2:00:56.480 --> 2:01:03.040]  and tell you especially you know my mouth to your ear is that especially now we've got the
[2:01:03.040 --> 2:01:09.360]  tommy robinson thing going on now i know in england they have the magna carta here we have the
[2:01:09.360 --> 2:01:17.760]  constitution that was supposedly muddled after that but we have our bill of rights because we
[2:01:17.760 --> 2:01:25.440]  are a republic everybody i hear even on info wars says says democracy we are not a total
[2:01:25.440 --> 2:01:32.560]  democracy or a representative republic yes we are a republic but nobody ever points that
[2:01:32.560 --> 2:01:37.440]  out no i need to do it more i think i should cut a promo where i explain that democracy pure
[2:01:37.440 --> 2:01:42.320]  democracy is two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner the first democracies in in in greece
[2:01:42.320 --> 2:01:46.080]  they would have you know one bucket of white rocks one bucket of black rocks whoever got the most
[2:01:46.080 --> 2:01:50.880]  you know yay or nay they would vote routinely to kill somebody who they didn't like what they said
[2:01:50.880 --> 2:01:58.640]  so in a pure democracy 51 could vote to kill the other 49 percent people knew what it was they would
[2:01:58.640 --> 2:02:06.720]  never say i want to live in a democracy but we may need to have it pointed out that we are a republic
[2:02:06.720 --> 2:02:12.640]  so that we can defend ourselves someday and not end that's right we have a bill of rights we we
[2:02:12.640 --> 2:02:17.680]  have a republican form of government a federalist system it's a limited democracy and it's set up
[2:02:17.680 --> 2:02:22.080]  with game rules to protect the minorities as well as the majority we have the best form of government
[2:02:22.080 --> 2:02:26.960]  the world we've had a lot of problems a lot of corruption but the ideals in our system are the
[2:02:26.960 --> 2:02:31.280]  best that's why it's under attack by these multinational corporations that pay no tax
[2:02:31.280 --> 2:02:35.840]  are totally lawless and are tax exempt and have diplomatic immunity they are the enemy of this
[2:02:35.840 --> 2:02:42.480]  system they want to destroy it you are the only one with the audience big enough to actually start
[2:02:42.480 --> 2:02:48.240]  to wake people up sir i used to hammer the hell out of the democracy versus republic deal and i
[2:02:48.240 --> 2:02:54.000]  just when you done it 10 000 times you sound preachy but you're right we we are a republic not a
[2:02:54.000 --> 2:03:00.080]  democracy there is a big difference and you're absolutely on target could you possibly someday
[2:03:00.080 --> 2:03:05.840]  actually entertain the idea of of being back on the shortwave it might be in yours and everybody
[2:03:05.840 --> 2:03:12.880]  else back on back on the shortwave yeah instead of i mean if you get cut off of youtube last time
[2:03:12.880 --> 2:03:17.920]  i checked i'm still on paying to be on shortwave we're not on there we're not on there uh i used
[2:03:17.920 --> 2:03:23.360]  to listen to you i think on w w c r but now that i got you on youtube it's a lot better i can see
[2:03:23.360 --> 2:03:28.000]  your smiling face oh god i feel sorry for what you're nice thank you god bless you sometimes
[2:03:28.000 --> 2:03:32.880]  i get sick of myself but thank you so much john i believe we're on w w c r because that's one of
[2:03:32.880 --> 2:03:37.200]  the things i just pay each month to be on there six hours a day because i get letters from missionaries
[2:03:37.200 --> 2:03:41.760]  and people in africa and folks listening and a lot of folks in middle of nowhere listen we better be on
[2:03:41.760 --> 2:03:46.880]  there um you guys go call w w c r just call the number off their deal and ask when we're on or
[2:03:46.880 --> 2:03:50.880]  check with accounting and make sure i'm paying for that we pay for a lot of satellites a lot of other
[2:03:50.880 --> 2:03:56.080]  stuff there's been some mom and pop stations that we've been on you know 15 16 17 years and i
[2:03:56.080 --> 2:04:00.160]  sent a little check to each month we may actually have to stop doing that though these lawsuits
[2:04:00.160 --> 2:04:04.240]  and you know their plans to shut us down you know go further but hopefully that's not the case but
[2:04:04.240 --> 2:04:08.560]  yeah i'm i'm putting all the coal in the in the engine here to get the water boiling to get the
[2:04:08.560 --> 2:04:14.560]  pistons going or to get the wheels turning so that we can go full attack speed and the and the
[2:04:14.560 --> 2:04:19.600]  satellites we're getting a lot of new tv stations a lot of new radio stations uh a lot of new cable
[2:04:19.600 --> 2:04:23.840]  systems but those are new listeners getting used to us so they're they're not really buying a lot
[2:04:23.840 --> 2:04:27.440]  of stuff but we're reaching people we're getting contacts from them that's what matters it's our
[2:04:27.440 --> 2:04:32.480]  original hardcore audience that despite all the attacks like a lighthouse and they're out on that

[2:06:22.560 --> 2:06:27.600]  thank you so much for joining us alley alexander is a political consultant philosopher and activist
[2:06:27.600 --> 2:06:32.960]  an organizer of american priority dot com he has been consulting for republican campaigns
[2:06:32.960 --> 2:06:37.040]  and conservative issues for 11 years the national level but now he is much more interested in
[2:06:37.040 --> 2:06:42.880]  philosophy and building a better society and it's a patreon dot com four slash alley alexander
[2:06:42.880 --> 2:06:49.280]  twitter at alley well that's a coveted at twitter an organizer at american priority dot com i love
[2:06:49.280 --> 2:06:54.160]  that name i love the clips and things i've seen of him over the years and i'm just glad we've
[2:06:54.160 --> 2:06:59.360]  got him here with us today to talk about where he sees us as a philosopher and as a political
[2:06:59.360 --> 2:07:04.880]  consultant at this moment in time if the enemy wrote the history books or if we wrote the history
[2:07:04.880 --> 2:07:10.560]  books in the future what you would call this period i i think it's the second great awakening
[2:07:10.560 --> 2:07:15.760]  uh the the the true launch of the renaissance uh that what we've seen the last 500 years all
[2:07:15.760 --> 2:07:20.880]  the problems but also the good things was the detonator and so now we're going to see exploding
[2:07:20.880 --> 2:07:26.080]  towards that singularity and if we just make it through the next 30 40 years i think we're
[2:07:26.080 --> 2:07:32.000]  going to look back on this time uh as the as right before the new golden age i agree with
[2:07:32.000 --> 2:07:36.160]  scott adams and others and a lot of people in the establishment realize that they cover control but
[2:07:36.160 --> 2:07:42.240]  maybe i'm wrong and then we'll look at rosanne bar and oh i was on ambien or i was i got multiple
[2:07:42.240 --> 2:07:47.840]  personalities why is she backing off from a joke they've they've caricatured me as an eight
[2:07:47.840 --> 2:07:53.360]  trump as a as an orangutan george w as a as a chimpanzee because i mean let's face it trumps
[2:07:53.360 --> 2:07:58.640]  hair when it was orange looks like orangutan colored i mean i've i've actually told i mean i've
[2:07:58.640 --> 2:08:03.120]  had girlfriends before like their hair bleach when it's black or brown i'm like that looks horrible
[2:08:03.120 --> 2:08:06.720]  your hair looks like an orangutan i mean brunette should not bleach their hair it looks like an
[2:08:06.720 --> 2:08:10.800]  orangutan uh now trump i guess it's just bad coloring but i mean i don't care i kind of
[2:08:10.800 --> 2:08:15.360]  like his orange hair it's kind of it's a funny trademark but uh so we're going to cover the
[2:08:15.360 --> 2:08:20.000]  field here uh thank you so much for joining us today sir it's it's good to have you on board
[2:08:20.000 --> 2:08:26.800]  with us well thanks alex it's nice to uh finally connect well you heard me lay out the buffet and
[2:08:26.800 --> 2:08:30.240]  you've got a million points i know you can cover what do you want to tackle first where we are in
[2:08:30.240 --> 2:08:35.680]  history or the whole rosanne thing let's talk about rosanne because she's under fire in fact
[2:08:35.680 --> 2:08:42.720]  just in the past half hour one of our mutual uh opponents ben Shapiro is giving rosanne hell he's
[2:08:42.720 --> 2:08:48.480]  talking crap about me on his podcast right now live he's talking crap about you and what we really
[2:08:48.480 --> 2:08:54.080]  need to protect is free speech free thought free expression and free association so that's why i'm
[2:08:54.080 --> 2:09:00.000]  here on info wars because we got to start talking we cannot let the oligarchs and the people that
[2:09:00.000 --> 2:09:05.920]  you know ben Shapiro is associated with control our thoughts or what we do or who we associate with
[2:09:05.920 --> 2:09:12.000]  yeah i love it how the left is always policing who you can talk to who you can uh associate with
[2:09:12.000 --> 2:09:16.960]  always misrepresenting who they're demonizing they want to be the policemen uh of discussion the
[2:09:16.960 --> 2:09:22.560]  thought police and it's just some heroes always popping up saying alex jones is bad don't go on
[2:09:22.560 --> 2:09:27.120]  his show uh rosanne's not a conservative well i mean i tend to agree but he's saying you know
[2:09:27.120 --> 2:09:32.240]  she's a bad person all this crap or what she said was racist when it clearly wasn't and so that's
[2:09:32.240 --> 2:09:37.920]  my issue is that he's propped up by some texas billionaires fine but the guy is not self made he
[2:09:37.920 --> 2:09:42.960]  couldn't build anything and i'm just tired of him now becoming the new glenn beck trying to be in our
[2:09:42.960 --> 2:09:49.120]  business yeah look i dropped out of college twice you know i went to college i went to bible college
[2:09:49.120 --> 2:09:55.280]  in dallas dropped out went to a university of north texas and didn't drop out started my business
[2:09:56.000 --> 2:10:02.000]  in 2006 2007 hit it big when digital uh was coming to a republican campaign so i've been
[2:10:02.000 --> 2:10:06.640]  really fortunate and blessed to be good at what i've done and i've largely been behind the scenes
[2:10:06.640 --> 2:10:11.760]  i've worked for hacks like john mccain i made christine o donnell the household whole name
[2:10:12.320 --> 2:10:17.520]  the tea party challenged the republican party in new york 23 if you remember i am back and
[2:10:17.520 --> 2:10:21.520]  in uh new york 23 uh you know that was really the birth of the tea party movement so i've
[2:10:21.520 --> 2:10:26.880]  heard successful intellectual in the launch of the new renaissance yeah and i i'm a black
[2:10:26.880 --> 2:10:32.320]  i'm a biracial black arab and the republican party but ben Shapiro has been you know kind of
[2:10:32.320 --> 2:10:38.240]  cultivated since he was 14 he has all these major foundations paying him 10 000 20 000
[2:10:38.240 --> 2:10:42.560]  dollars to speak at these colleges while he's trying to deport platform people like you
[2:10:42.560 --> 2:10:48.080]  were milo unopolis it's absolutely batshit crazy and i'm not going to tolerate it anymore it's time
[2:10:48.080 --> 2:10:53.520]  for people to start pushing against the thought police on the left and the right and embracing
[2:10:53.520 --> 2:10:59.760]  free thinkers like kanye and rosanne who might be on the left or you and i who might be on the right
[2:10:59.760 --> 2:11:05.040]  exactly he's there to gatekeep that's why the leftist groups fund him to keep conservatives and liberals
[2:11:06.160 --> 2:11:10.240]  exactly the loyal opposition to keep liberals and conservatives apart and to make sure that
[2:11:10.240 --> 2:11:17.120]  libertarian renaissance ideas of taking humanity forward don't come together he's a total gatekeeper
[2:11:17.120 --> 2:11:22.560]  calling for us to be censored while he's financed by the universities he is a shameful person and
[2:11:22.560 --> 2:11:30.320]  the reason we raise him is he's just such a created artificial commodity who thinks he's our god but
[2:11:30.320 --> 2:11:34.960]  when you go to his own website that has some great articles most of the comments hate his guts so
[2:11:34.960 --> 2:11:41.440]  what does that tell you it tells me that he's out of touch you know he might make a fine publisher
[2:11:41.440 --> 2:11:46.640]  and he's got encyclopedic knowledge about politics and current events but have you ever heard i mean
[2:11:46.640 --> 2:11:50.400]  you know alice you've been in this longer than i have i've been in it for 11 years but have we
[2:11:50.400 --> 2:11:55.200]  ever heard an original thought from ben Shapiro i've heard original thoughts from mike sternovich
[2:11:55.200 --> 2:12:02.320]  no he i mean for me he is the king of plagiarism well you know i you know that that may be true too
[2:12:02.320 --> 2:12:06.480]  and an intellectual plagiarist that's all i'm saying because so many things i've heard him say
[2:12:06.480 --> 2:12:10.960]  i know are from other famous philosophers and others which is fine but you just be clear that
[2:12:10.960 --> 2:12:16.320]  when i quote cicero i tell people it's cicero or i quote nishi i tell people it's nishi yeah and
[2:12:16.320 --> 2:12:20.480]  that's and that's and that's very very true and i think that what you're doing is you're hitting
[2:12:20.480 --> 2:12:25.600]  the nail on the head he's misguiding some of these youth you know these college youth that you know
[2:12:25.600 --> 2:12:29.840]  worship him and worship milo and can't understand where the beef is they're like hey you guys all
[2:12:29.840 --> 2:12:34.960]  need to get along well we can't get along when ben Shapiro is trying to de platform us and
[2:12:34.960 --> 2:12:39.600]  steal everyone else's ideas in what other era that's right i mean i've talked to i mean just off
[2:12:39.600 --> 2:12:44.800]  record he wasn't off record discussion but i've had off record discussions as well with other people
[2:12:44.800 --> 2:12:48.720]  but like Shapiro's in everybody's business he's the one that basically ran yinopoulos out of
[2:12:48.720 --> 2:12:53.920]  right bart he was always trying to get rid of him he didn't want more good people at right bart to win
[2:12:53.920 --> 2:13:00.240]  he wanted to be in total control makes me sick he's got that narcissist psycho looking his eye yeah
[2:13:00.240 --> 2:13:04.320]  well i'm gonna after after this appearance what i'm gonna do is i'm actually gonna send him an
[2:13:04.320 --> 2:13:10.000]  email i'm gonna offer him a piece if he doesn't want peace we're going to war i can talk about
[2:13:10.000 --> 2:13:14.880]  how he and his friends have stopped the friends of abe from meeting i can talk about how he skipped
[2:13:14.880 --> 2:13:21.120]  out on uh andrew brightbart who is a mutual friend of ours obviously uh uh i can talk about how he
[2:13:21.120 --> 2:13:26.000]  skipped out on one of andrew brightbart's memorials uh in washington dc a party that i threw where
[2:13:26.000 --> 2:13:30.400]  everyone else was there steve was there larry was there the entire bright bart team was there but
[2:13:30.400 --> 2:13:34.880]  ben Shapiro couldn't uh couldn't make it on time and then wanted to break fire code when he came up
[2:13:34.880 --> 2:13:40.960]  so we can start a war with ben Shapiro if he really really wants one but what i want is i want more
[2:13:40.960 --> 2:13:45.120]  voices not less that's what he wants less voices and he wants to say who can talk to who so the
[2:13:45.120 --> 2:13:49.120]  reason we brought him up because he's not that important is uh i i guess he's attacking you
[2:13:49.120 --> 2:13:54.480]  coming on the day he thinks he's god he's attacking me for defending roseanne bar and it just so
[2:13:54.480 --> 2:13:59.600]  happens that it comes at a time when i'm about to appear on your show to talk about roseanne bar
[2:13:59.600 --> 2:14:05.440]  and i'm happy to defend uh people who aren't racist roseanne is not a racist if she was a racist i
[2:14:05.440 --> 2:14:10.160]  would call her out i can't believe she's i agree she's falling on her sword like this for making
[2:14:10.160 --> 2:14:15.840]  jokes i mean come on yeah and alex i mean just like all right me you and the audience leveling
[2:14:15.840 --> 2:14:20.480]  out i didn't think i was going to tell anyone this but i got on my periscope 15 000 people
[2:14:20.480 --> 2:14:25.840]  tuned in and i had a confession i said look i've actually looked at valerie jarrett before because
[2:14:25.840 --> 2:14:31.920]  she has sunken eyes a protruded mouth this isn't necessarily a black feature ben stiller who's a
[2:14:31.920 --> 2:14:37.280]  jewish comedian uh has the same features and big ears there's same there's all kinds of people who
[2:14:37.280 --> 2:14:41.840]  look like different characters snoop dog looks like a dog but i've looked at valerie jarrett and i
[2:14:41.840 --> 2:14:48.480]  said wow she looks like arie from the reboot of planet of the apes in 2001 and i never wanted to
[2:14:48.480 --> 2:14:54.080]  tell anyone that because i am aware of the uh the racial sensitivity and i don't want anyone to go
[2:14:54.080 --> 2:14:59.120]  around calling black people monkeys but let's be clear roseanne bar did not call did not say that
[2:14:59.120 --> 2:15:04.720]  black people look like monkeys she didn't even say that valerie jarrett looks like a monkey she said
[2:15:04.720 --> 2:15:11.600]  muslim brotherhood and planet of the apes equal the jay what she was saying is it's a hodgepodge
[2:15:11.600 --> 2:15:18.480]  of beliefs and a look and it wasn't sensitive she didn't know valerie jarrett was um was uh 65
[2:15:18.480 --> 2:15:23.840]  percent black uh i you know but but come on let's just be really really honest about this
[2:15:23.840 --> 2:15:28.960]  she wasn't comparing valerie jarrett to a monkey because she thinks she's dumb valerie jarrett

[2:20:16.640 --> 2:20:26.160]  collectivism and the big corporations pushing it if you are receiving this transmission you
[2:20:26.160 --> 2:20:35.200]  are the resistance live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones ali alexander is our
[2:20:35.200 --> 2:20:42.240]  guest political consultant analyst talk show host you name it patreon.com forward slash ali alexander
[2:20:42.240 --> 2:20:48.240]  twitter at ali it's an amazingly good twitter handle right there isn't it and the point is
[2:20:48.240 --> 2:20:53.280]  is that he's been private until recently he's been behind the scenes political guru for the whole
[2:20:53.280 --> 2:20:57.840]  kind of trump wave you're seeing but even before that he's worked for republic establishment and
[2:20:57.840 --> 2:21:04.000]  now he more and more is going public to a great fanfare and to a lot of support kind of blasting
[2:21:04.000 --> 2:21:08.080]  onto the scene even though he's been behind the scenes for a while why did you feel that this
[2:21:08.080 --> 2:21:12.640]  last year or so is the time for you to do this because what the ultimate culture war is now
[2:21:12.640 --> 2:21:19.120]  manifesting or why yeah we are it you know alex you hit you know your readers may not know how
[2:21:19.120 --> 2:21:23.840]  well read you are how you you know spend time you know studying these topics when you're not on air
[2:21:23.840 --> 2:21:27.760]  you and i have a number even though we've never met we have a number of mutual friends so i've
[2:21:27.760 --> 2:21:34.560]  heard uh you know the rumors but we really are 40 or 50 years from determining whether we will live
[2:21:34.560 --> 2:21:41.920]  as corporate slaves or whether we can be free and peaceful around the world and so what i thought
[2:21:41.920 --> 2:21:48.160]  is that the maga movement needed somebody who knew what ben knew edmund burk russell kirk you know
[2:21:48.160 --> 2:21:53.920]  traditional conservatism someone the maga movement needed somebody to guide them through okay well
[2:21:53.920 --> 2:21:58.480]  what is the repeal process of obama care look like because there are people who were lying to the
[2:21:58.480 --> 2:22:03.920]  president and i had to get on periscope and make sure that the white house comms department was
[2:22:03.920 --> 2:22:09.200]  putting stuff on the president's desk and so um you know i'm willing to burn down my career
[2:22:09.200 --> 2:22:14.880]  because if we all pledge to each other our lives our fortunes our our honor then i think we can
[2:22:14.880 --> 2:22:18.640]  save this country and the world because of the globalists know they have us they win for those
[2:22:18.640 --> 2:22:23.600]  that don't know obama care written to screw everybody over trumps destroying that this new
[2:22:23.600 --> 2:22:29.680]  thing he did this this right to fight for your life this uh this right to try think about how
[2:22:29.680 --> 2:22:33.920]  the left's fighting that when they're saying have the right to commit suicide well i'm a libertarian
[2:22:33.920 --> 2:22:37.680]  i say okay you don't have the state involved that's where i say i'll fight the death against it
[2:22:37.680 --> 2:22:42.080]  that's what bill gates pushes but now they're all pissed about the right to try what is wrong
[2:22:42.080 --> 2:22:47.760]  with these people big pharma big pharma it's the same thing that's wrong with um you know when the
[2:22:47.760 --> 2:22:53.200]  riddling comments were made the other day it's the same thing uh that's wrong why uh the ambient
[2:22:53.200 --> 2:22:59.680]  the parent company of ambient attacked rosa and bar today they want us i mean i i i wish this was a
[2:22:59.680 --> 2:23:06.080]  conspiracy i'm not a conspiracist there's a lot of it's an open conspiracy it's an open conspiracy
[2:23:06.080 --> 2:23:14.480]  that cnn would not survive without big pharma period and so what they don't want is i'll tell you
[2:23:14.480 --> 2:23:19.600]  out i actually made a lot of money when trump got elected why because the next day i got up and i
[2:23:19.600 --> 2:23:24.640]  bought an etf called labu now this is not investment advice i'm not talking about the timing now but
[2:23:24.640 --> 2:23:31.760]  the day after the election i bought a ton of labu it's an etf that puts together a lot of biotech
[2:23:31.760 --> 2:23:36.720]  stocks why because i was listening to the president and he said i'm going to war with the fda because
[2:23:36.720 --> 2:23:41.680]  we're going to reduce drug prices but i'm not going to let you be dependent on it what trump is
[2:23:41.680 --> 2:23:47.840]  doing is absolutely genius he wants there to be more available cheaper drugs but he doesn't want
[2:23:47.840 --> 2:23:53.280]  anyone dependent on them we have not seen a president who is this empathetic and this knowledgeable
[2:23:53.280 --> 2:24:00.240]  about how policy affects people as societies and communities uh maybe ever i was about to say he is
[2:24:00.240 --> 2:24:07.680]  he is so incredibly empathetic yeah and and then when you really study the policy it what he ends up
[2:24:07.680 --> 2:24:12.320]  doing is so good so what do you get congress to do it'd be even better and like he said today
[2:24:12.960 --> 2:24:16.320]  i said i don't care what bill you get through i want the bill that's the best for the people
[2:24:16.320 --> 2:24:20.320]  and i want real experts on that that aren't from big pharma and i want wide spectrum analysis
[2:24:20.320 --> 2:24:26.000]  and he said i don't care what they think that's why they're so angry yeah yeah because you and i
[2:24:26.000 --> 2:24:31.200]  know you're a libertarian i'm a conservative you and i know that the corporations actually want to
[2:24:31.200 --> 2:24:36.960]  limit the competition because then they have a monopoly and um so the right to try breaks open
[2:24:36.960 --> 2:24:43.920]  those doors look i'm surprised trumps has done this good i'm not just a sycophant just groveling
[2:24:43.920 --> 2:24:48.000]  i was freaked out when my gut told me to endorse him but i've gone with it and now it's been right
[2:24:48.000 --> 2:24:52.080]  i can't believe though he's gotten this much done and i really worry what is the system gonna do
[2:24:52.080 --> 2:24:57.600]  because they're getting you know we see videos now a fox news host are having uh coffee and tea
[2:24:57.600 --> 2:25:03.040]  thrown on them at restaurants not just me this hate by the crazed cult of the left that aren't
[2:25:03.040 --> 2:25:09.680]  even leftist that are just just just just just just trash news junkies they are so crazed up and so
[2:25:09.680 --> 2:25:14.720]  existentially threatened by us just trying to give them renaissance that i wonder what they're
[2:25:14.720 --> 2:25:20.240]  gonna do next it's it's gonna get really really bad i you know before the steve's khali stuff i
[2:25:20.240 --> 2:25:26.800]  said that it would be a year before um the left engaged in radicalized violence and i was wrong
[2:25:26.800 --> 2:25:32.320]  it happened about three months after i gave a predictive analysis that any society that has
[2:25:32.320 --> 2:25:38.400]  engaged in this this is where the people charged with disseminating information hide information
[2:25:38.400 --> 2:25:43.840]  about violence from the public it allows no chilling effect so if you study sociology
[2:25:43.840 --> 2:25:48.000]  you knew this stuff was coming and so when the steve's khali shoot shooting was coming well of
[2:25:48.000 --> 2:25:54.560]  course it had to happen there were organized mexican gangs uh antifa and democrat activists
[2:25:54.560 --> 2:26:01.920]  in san jose in 2016 who beat the living crap out of trump supporters and that's when i decided okay
[2:26:01.920 --> 2:26:07.280]  i gotta support this guy because i've i've sat with trump we've talked in 2014 they told me
[2:26:07.280 --> 2:26:11.520]  that he was going to run i didn't believe sam numberg when he told me they offered to hire me
[2:26:11.520 --> 2:26:16.720]  in 2011 i had spent money uh with a super PAC against trump so i've i've spent my life because
[2:26:16.720 --> 2:26:20.320]  you're really a real progressive i would guess that they meant progressing humanity not what
[2:26:20.320 --> 2:26:24.320]  they're doing trying to take control if they start this race war this won't be good for any common
[2:26:24.320 --> 2:26:30.320]  people no it won't it won't it will lead in utter bloodshed and then the corporations will promise
[2:26:30.320 --> 2:26:36.240]  us to bring us peace you know by total political correctness and school level brainwashing you
[2:26:36.240 --> 2:26:41.520]  can see them priming it george soros is openly the main funder of the starbucks brainwashing
[2:26:41.520 --> 2:26:47.120]  i mean you can see their plan it's not a joke it's not an exaggeration i am not anyone who's
[2:26:47.120 --> 2:26:52.560]  ever peddled any conspiracy or anything like that any one-off theory i've tried to see the
[2:26:52.560 --> 2:26:57.360]  wiki leaks that they want culture war they want a culture war they want a culture war that's
[2:26:57.360 --> 2:27:00.400]  that's how they're gonna make their money it's very intriguing we're going to break and come back
[2:27:00.400 --> 2:27:04.240]  into a bunch of the subjects but yeah get into the fact if you were a big guru of the republican
[2:27:04.240 --> 2:27:08.640]  still are work for mccain work for others and and how you were told trump was running is what you
[2:27:08.640 --> 2:27:13.760]  just said i learned you know once he was already running from folks that he'd been drafted by the
[2:27:13.760 --> 2:27:17.280]  military that was already thinking about a coup against the globalists because they were another
[2:27:17.280 --> 2:27:22.880]  multinational coup but they decided no let's draft somebody get behind them reboot america we can do
[2:27:22.880 --> 2:27:27.680]  it and then this has all happened so now the fb is gone from claiming we're russians to now behind
[2:27:27.680 --> 2:27:32.480]  the scenes they think roger shun and i were not even involved in any of this higher level pentagon
[2:27:32.480 --> 2:27:37.840]  people are now trying to claim we're the mastermind of an american coup against the democrats so at
[2:27:37.840 --> 2:27:42.640]  least now at the rubber meets the road level 13 people have been questioned they're segwaying away
[2:27:42.640 --> 2:27:48.640]  from russia to okay who's the american cabal well it's it's an open conspiracy of people that don't
[2:27:48.640 --> 2:27:54.080]  want to be slaves right and that's and that's the truth and we're fighting back and we as americans
[2:27:54.080 --> 2:27:58.800]  are promised in our constitution that we can take any stance on any policy and that's not tradition
[2:27:58.800 --> 2:28:05.120]  that doesn't violate the logan act it's entirely crazy what a faction inside the doj and the deep
[2:28:05.120 --> 2:28:10.080]  sater doing but thank god for trump because now we have more whistleblowers than ever and after the
[2:28:10.080 --> 2:28:15.120]  break i want to get more into that because the people who are doing the hard work are the whistleblowers
[2:28:15.120 --> 2:28:20.000]  at the doj and thank god trump is creating a spectacle in the public that's providing that is
[2:28:20.000 --> 2:28:24.400]  so on target ali because they make it like we're against the fb of the doj no we're against the
[2:28:24.400 --> 2:28:30.000]  clinton criminal cancer cabal less than one tenth of one percent running the whole show
[2:28:30.000 --> 2:28:35.520]  and it's it is the fbi and it is the doj and it is the cia and it is the pentagon that is helping
[2:28:35.520 --> 2:28:39.920]  the american people try to remove this because finally they understood that the country was
[2:28:39.920 --> 2:28:44.880]  about to be completely ended by hillary she was going to sell us out to china it was over so what
[2:28:44.880 --> 2:28:49.120]  were they going to do when they lost they freaked out and said we're not giving up we're going to
[2:28:49.120 --> 2:28:56.160]  call trump or russian and flip the script on them we'll be back with ali alexander this is dan

[2:33:35.280 --> 2:33:44.240]  alley alexander made the point about close to half of mainstream news is funding is big
[2:33:44.240 --> 2:33:48.960]  pharma when i was famously on pierce morgan they admitted the top news event of that year top ratings
[2:33:49.840 --> 2:33:53.360]  they i was banned everywhere else after that because i was getting people out of the paradigm i
[2:33:53.360 --> 2:33:56.560]  was shaking them out of their trance they admitted that they were going to have me on for most of the
[2:33:56.560 --> 2:34:01.200]  hour but as soon as i in the second segment talked about don't blame american gun owners for some of
[2:34:01.200 --> 2:34:08.560]  the shootings that they're very rare but still you know out of control i said blame the mass
[2:34:08.560 --> 2:34:13.760]  murder pills on the inserts the prozac class drugs it says it can cause you to commit suicide
[2:34:13.760 --> 2:34:19.680]  megalomania mass murder you name it and boy they were cutting that segment off at that point so here's
[2:34:19.680 --> 2:34:26.000]  a piece of that famous footage america's number one cause of unnatural death now is suicide alex not
[2:34:26.000 --> 2:34:30.720]  not a real accident not cancer not you excuse me of attacking the second member of the constitution
[2:34:30.720 --> 2:34:36.160]  i want to get people off pills that the insert says we need to commit suicide and kill people alex
[2:34:36.160 --> 2:34:41.600]  let's get about the second i want to blow the real culprit alex suicide pills alex mass murder
[2:34:41.600 --> 2:34:45.760]  pills okay let me ask you one question you'll believe in this i'm wrong first time anybody's
[2:34:45.760 --> 2:34:52.560]  ever heard this by the way i didn't like that so ali alexander i wanted you to get into though
[2:34:52.560 --> 2:34:58.960]  behind the scenes first being told trump would run 2014 2015 uh and what was going on behind the
[2:34:58.960 --> 2:35:01.600]  scenes because that's critical for the history we're now witnessing and then we'll get into the
[2:35:01.600 --> 2:35:07.760]  whistleblowers you were talking about now critical that is so in 2014 i was the deputy director of
[2:35:07.760 --> 2:35:14.000]  an rnc sponsored conference uh it was a republican leadership conference and uh donald trump uh was
[2:35:14.000 --> 2:35:20.880]  flying in uh you know he had some accommodations that he wanted and at this point alex i did not
[2:35:20.880 --> 2:35:26.320]  like trump i like i said in 2011 i found a big funder to spend some money to try to keep him
[2:35:26.320 --> 2:35:32.400]  out of the primary i didn't consider him conservative uh you know i i didn't like his social or moral
[2:35:33.200 --> 2:35:40.320]  values and when i walked in that room i was hit with this burst of energy and the dude is one of
[2:35:40.320 --> 2:35:45.760]  the most empathetic dudes you will ever meet he's an empath really everyone was so scared they were
[2:35:45.760 --> 2:35:50.400]  they were standing and i thought well i'm gonna show this guy you know and i sat down on the
[2:35:50.400 --> 2:35:54.720]  couch and then he said you know what you look like sammy davis jr and i'm sure you know you're
[2:35:54.720 --> 2:35:58.720]  coming as well exactly and what people look like they look like that let he looks like a fish you
[2:35:58.720 --> 2:36:04.960]  look like sammy davis jr i look like a pumpkin i mean you know and and and we're all god's children
[2:36:04.960 --> 2:36:10.480]  you know we're all god's children rosa and bar believes that i mean rosa and bar is a jewish woman
[2:36:10.480 --> 2:36:15.520]  who wants peace around the world you know she retweets stuff about palestinian children and she
[2:36:15.520 --> 2:36:20.960]  wants to secure israel i mean and she stood up for tommy robinson yeah so that the people think
[2:36:20.960 --> 2:36:26.480]  that she has this secret hate in her heart and she's been working in hollywood for decades is
[2:36:26.480 --> 2:36:32.720]  absolutely hogwash but anyway so me and trump this is what i noticed alex is i'm used to writing
[2:36:32.720 --> 2:36:38.160]  people's speeches trump had computer paper and a sharpie and was writing his own speech
[2:36:38.160 --> 2:36:42.480]  a half hour before oh that's what's incredible with trump they go oh oh notice he wrote a
[2:36:42.480 --> 2:36:46.800]  letter to a teacher they made fun of it because of grammatical errors and things yeah hey you
[2:36:46.800 --> 2:36:54.080]  actually got a letter from him yeah people do not know this man is authentic and i'm not gonna
[2:36:54.080 --> 2:36:59.760]  talk about what happened for the next half hour but i'll say that the dude's memory is very astute
[2:36:59.760 --> 2:37:05.520]  he quoted uh four of the most recent state polls within louisiana because republicans
[2:37:05.520 --> 2:37:09.600]  were divided uh there and he told the candidate to get out of the race and i thought well here's
[2:37:09.600 --> 2:37:15.680]  a man who's empathetic writes his own speeches and cares about the republican party uh uh
[2:37:15.680 --> 2:37:20.560]  getting a majority so anyway he gets on stage uh he gives a rousing speech he gets off stage
[2:37:20.560 --> 2:37:24.560]  he says ali i want to walk where do i have to go now i said well i have to take you through
[2:37:24.560 --> 2:37:29.120]  the kitchen to take you to your press conference and he said no i want to walk through the crowd
[2:37:29.120 --> 2:37:34.160]  and i said well you're trump let's do it and we walked through the crowd and the next governor who
[2:37:34.160 --> 2:37:40.720]  who uh our governor uh our old governor got on stage and don trump just walked off stage
[2:37:40.720 --> 2:37:45.520]  so here's all these louisiana state troopers me and trump and the crowd just goes like this
[2:37:45.520 --> 2:37:50.240]  and i realized the man is a strategist and strategist and so i took him to steve bannon
[2:37:50.240 --> 2:37:55.280]  he did his hit then we went to uh the press conference we ran that he denounced racism
[2:37:55.280 --> 2:38:01.440]  and donald sterling uh you know the uh nva owner so anyway they were telling me they said ali we're
[2:38:01.440 --> 2:38:05.200]  really gonna run and i said sam you guys aren't running this is always a joke with y'all but i
[2:38:05.200 --> 2:38:11.280]  realized that i needed to rethink how i saw this man when when donald trump did run i did not support
[2:38:11.280 --> 2:38:16.480]  him in the primary but when it came to violence and when i saw that donald trump was willing to
[2:38:16.480 --> 2:38:22.560]  sit down with christian leaders and conservative leaders like mike pence and uh james dobson
[2:38:22.560 --> 2:38:27.600]  and now you see that he's marching at pro-life events that no republicans ever done i mean he's
[2:38:27.600 --> 2:38:32.560]  the real deal he's the real deal by the way it's not it's not a trump grovelfest here he's changed
[2:38:32.560 --> 2:38:37.680]  a lot too he's become a lot more christian he's he's told me that personally and he said no it's
[2:38:37.680 --> 2:38:40.880]  true he said that was never really around all these real churches he was around these fake
[2:38:40.880 --> 2:38:45.760]  churches didn't have any energy and he loves veterans he loves black churches he loves everybody
[2:38:45.760 --> 2:38:50.640]  but that's what trump the talks i've had is what you talk about boom the energy and then he talks
[2:38:50.640 --> 2:38:57.040]  about the energy and trump is all about good energy it's not meta it's not mumbo jumbo it's that the
[2:38:57.040 --> 2:39:02.400]  left he picks up an energy of death the the energy of pro-life and patriots he picks up the energy
[2:39:02.400 --> 2:39:08.640]  of life and that's what he gets he literally gets charged up by people but he's not vampiric he charges
[2:39:08.640 --> 2:39:15.840]  you up yeah this is not new age uh book crap this is the study of psychology and when he was a child
[2:39:15.840 --> 2:39:21.920]  he studied under a pastor who who uh was famous for talking about the power of positivity and so
[2:39:21.920 --> 2:39:28.800]  in a lot of ways trump went decades of his life without authentic christians and people who wanted
[2:39:28.800 --> 2:39:34.640]  to return to localities back self-governance and when he finally came to it like what you said
[2:39:34.640 --> 2:39:39.600]  he's come our way where they've come his way i'm not sick of family no he said he said publicly
[2:39:39.600 --> 2:39:44.720]  privately he said i've changed he goes i know god's real i he could feel that the energy of bible
[2:39:44.720 --> 2:39:50.800]  believers is the strongest out there yeah it's it's absolutely true so it's it's obvious to me
[2:39:50.800 --> 2:39:56.720]  that god has a mandate on this man's life and this is either going exactly and look how much he scares
[2:39:56.720 --> 2:40:02.640]  true evil like soros and hillary and people they are so scared of him yeah think about it i mean he
[2:40:02.640 --> 2:40:09.840]  can call these nasty ms-13 gangs animals and the media will defend them this isn't about partisan
[2:40:09.840 --> 2:40:17.040]  politics this is about a social construct that is that now the right has an opportunity to meme with
[2:40:17.040 --> 2:40:21.520]  the left and the left has had a total monopoly for the past 50 years and then kanya talks about a
[2:40:21.520 --> 2:40:27.200]  bigger plan humanity the next level uh and love and trump talked about love today in his speech
[2:40:27.200 --> 2:40:33.360]  i mean i think we're really breaking the satanic will of the globalist right now and even believe
[2:40:33.360 --> 2:40:39.120]  in god folks their energy is take take take hate everybody just imagine the worst day you ever had
[2:40:39.120 --> 2:40:44.480]  times a thousand and and they've just given in to just total destruction they've got to be removed
[2:40:45.360 --> 2:40:49.600]  they they have to and what's what's brilliant about the time that we're living in alex and you're
[2:40:49.600 --> 2:40:54.080]  part of this your viewers are part of this i mean people are going to look back in 10 years
[2:40:54.080 --> 2:40:59.040]  and see that you are a pioneer in a field of new media i mean it's honestly going to be that we
[2:40:59.040 --> 2:41:05.200]  are going to break the media no one trusts them anymore not the bernie sanders justice democrats
[2:41:05.200 --> 2:41:10.720]  not the tea party conservatives and they think if they destroy me that destroys everyone leaving
[2:41:10.720 --> 2:41:17.520]  them it does nothing it it does absolutely nothing people are waking up kanya is waking up i don't
[2:41:17.520 --> 2:41:24.240]  believe in a holographic simulation uh theory but i do believe that there is a simulation of sorts
[2:41:24.240 --> 2:41:31.040]  right we're told go to college settle a lot of debt get on some drugs that is the fake simulation
[2:41:31.040 --> 2:41:37.920]  they get us to opt into their false paradigm yeah and it offers no freedom it offers no love it offers
[2:41:37.920 --> 2:41:42.880]  no redemption or forgiveness and that was what really struck me about hillary clinton's comments
[2:41:42.880 --> 2:41:47.520]  and that's when i chose i would go down with the ship i would go down with donald trump
[2:41:47.520 --> 2:41:51.520]  even though my friends were saying this will destroy your career i said i don't give a damn
[2:41:51.520 --> 2:41:56.320]  she said before she said that people were deplorable she said they were irredeemable i don't know a
[2:41:56.320 --> 2:42:01.600]  single method is she claims to be saying she's a god she's saying she's god right right and she
[2:42:01.600 --> 2:42:08.480]  has judged us unworthy and i said i said no siri i'll leave this country if she wins and i'm honest
[2:42:08.480 --> 2:42:12.160]  honest to god i was going to go move to south america i told trump that i might leave if she
[2:42:12.160 --> 2:42:16.880]  wants i'd have to she's coming he said you're not going to leave you're not going to leave he goes
[2:42:16.880 --> 2:42:20.880]  he goes you're going to have a bigger family a bigger house and in the way he said it didn't
[2:42:20.880 --> 2:42:27.680]  mean a bigger house like like america is a kingdom of liberty our house is getting bigger yeah yeah
[2:42:27.680 --> 2:42:32.400]  it isn't that amazing i mean and the bible talks about wherever two or more gather in my name
[2:42:32.400 --> 2:42:37.840]  they're all b and he said people don't receive because they asked and so we're imposing our
[2:42:37.840 --> 2:42:42.480]  real power against the simulation and we're all part of that your viewers are part of it is the
[2:42:42.480 --> 2:42:47.600]  matrix you're absolutely right they're creating a false cultural bullying matrix that's a haze

[2:47:05.520 --> 2:47:18.960]  he aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side
[2:47:18.960 --> 2:47:26.800]  you're listening to alex jones hollywood the big multinational corporations
[2:47:26.800 --> 2:47:31.760]  and communist china that now control it are so nasty want to break america's will so badly
[2:47:31.760 --> 2:47:38.800]  that they push too far and trump and and you and all of us and ali alexander are all a manifestation
[2:47:38.800 --> 2:47:44.240]  of that resistance but earlier ali was talking about people having a right to stand up and resist
[2:47:45.280 --> 2:47:50.160]  by voting or by political ideas or even physically if need be and i thought of the declaration of
[2:47:50.160 --> 2:47:57.920]  independence july 4th 1776 that's what july 4th is all about i know we all know that but we really
[2:47:57.920 --> 2:48:05.360]  consciously think about that recently they were going to have a commencement ball at one of the
[2:48:05.360 --> 2:48:12.240]  buildings by independence hall and the principal apologized assault the news or was it a professor
[2:48:12.240 --> 2:48:17.040]  i forget the the dean was either a college or high school assault last week he apologized for the
[2:48:17.040 --> 2:48:24.400]  ticket saying party like it 1776 they said oh some people are hurt by that because 1776 is about
[2:48:24.400 --> 2:48:28.800]  slavery no they almost got rid of it the first declaration and the first bill of rights and
[2:48:28.800 --> 2:48:35.280]  constitution the west is what got rid of all that there it is principal apologize for party like
[2:48:35.280 --> 2:48:41.200]  it's 1776 so it's all about virtue signaling but actually read what's in this listen how revolutionary
[2:48:41.200 --> 2:48:48.320]  it is the anonymous declaration of 13 united states of america and then it goes through i'm not going
[2:48:48.320 --> 2:48:53.120]  to read the whole thing but when in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people
[2:48:53.120 --> 2:48:59.280]  to dissolve the political bands with which have connected them with another and to assume among
[2:48:59.280 --> 2:49:06.080]  the powers of the earth the separate equal status station to which the laws of nature and gods
[2:49:06.080 --> 2:49:11.600]  entitle them a decent respect for the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare
[2:49:11.600 --> 2:49:17.840]  the cause which impel them to the separation and then it goes through the usurpations the
[2:49:17.840 --> 2:49:24.320]  criminal activity the behaviors and of course thomas jefferson wrote this the other guys approved
[2:49:24.320 --> 2:49:28.720]  of it we hold these trees be self-evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by
[2:49:28.720 --> 2:49:34.240]  their creator with certain inalienable rights that among them are life liberty pursuit of happiness
[2:49:34.240 --> 2:49:39.120]  that secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the
[2:49:39.120 --> 2:49:43.280]  consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends
[2:49:43.280 --> 2:49:48.000]  it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government
[2:49:48.000 --> 2:49:53.920]  laying its foundation on such principles and organizations in its powers in such form as to
[2:49:53.920 --> 2:50:00.880]  them shall seem most likely to affect their safety and happiness is trump doing that for you folks
[2:50:01.680 --> 2:50:07.600]  prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light
[2:50:07.600 --> 2:50:13.040]  and transient causes and accordingly all experience have shown that mankind are more disposed to
[2:50:13.040 --> 2:50:19.200]  suffer while evils are sufferable than to write themselves by abolishing the forms to which they
[2:50:19.200 --> 2:50:26.160]  are accustomed but when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariable the same objective
[2:50:26.800 --> 2:50:31.920]  invents as a design to reduce them under absolute despotism it is their right as their duty to
[2:50:31.920 --> 2:50:38.960]  throw off such government and provide new guards for their future security now thomas jefferson
[2:50:38.960 --> 2:50:44.000]  grew up on his farm with a bunch of black people and then when he became the owner of it when his
[2:50:44.000 --> 2:50:48.240]  dad died he tried to free them but there weren't laws to do it and he's on record trying to put
[2:50:48.240 --> 2:50:52.240]  it in the first declaration and then the first bill of rights and then the first constitution
[2:50:52.240 --> 2:50:55.840]  that came a decade later we didn't really have a government till they had to fight a war this was
[2:50:55.840 --> 2:51:02.160]  just starting a war signed by john hancock hollywood the media they all particularly demonize
[2:51:02.800 --> 2:51:07.920]  thomas jefferson now and say he was a racist because he had sex with the people he ended up
[2:51:07.920 --> 2:51:11.920]  freeing and had children with him okay but he was also hated around the neighborhood for being
[2:51:11.920 --> 2:51:16.880]  friendly to blacks so the guy that tried to free blacks because he was born into slavery he's the
[2:51:16.880 --> 2:51:25.200]  bad guys so think about the level of that of the trailblazer of the idea of it's hard to change he
[2:51:25.200 --> 2:51:31.280]  says that here but we've got to do it he tried it then it took 80 years till his vision happened
[2:51:31.280 --> 2:51:36.480]  and then they take the real symbol of that trailblazing to be the first guy doing in his time and
[2:51:36.480 --> 2:51:43.040]  turn into something bad alie alexander it's it's it's really it's really sad but when i sit when
[2:51:43.040 --> 2:51:47.520]  i travel this country and i i talk to people and they're like well you know i'm not totally
[2:51:47.520 --> 2:51:52.160]  convinced i said well in 20 years they're gonna be asking your children to denounce you while
[2:51:52.160 --> 2:51:58.320]  you're still alive and that's gonna be like mal's great leap and people really need to appreciate
[2:51:58.320 --> 2:52:03.040]  the school of thought that was going on then you had thomas hobs who said that man is inherently
[2:52:03.040 --> 2:52:07.680]  bad and might need monarchy and you had john lock that said man is inherently good and we
[2:52:07.680 --> 2:52:12.960]  deserve a republic or democracy well what thomas jefferson did is he kind of combined both of them
[2:52:12.960 --> 2:52:18.320]  he said the people have a right to self-govern if the monarch is not doing well and as you just read
[2:52:18.320 --> 2:52:25.840]  man is probably predisposed to do horrible things and our system is really the convergence of the
[2:52:25.840 --> 2:52:31.680]  best ideas of both western and eastern civilization so and people don't know and you kind of alluded
[2:52:31.680 --> 2:52:36.240]  to it we failed the first time with the articles of confederation so anyone who thinks oh well
[2:52:36.240 --> 2:52:42.400]  america will be here all along and and media is journalism because they got tv's and notepads
[2:52:42.400 --> 2:52:48.560]  it's not true corporate media is not journalism and we can fail again in america if we're not
[2:52:48.560 --> 2:52:53.920]  willing to speak up and it's a little embarrassing it's a little weird to be talking about rosa and
[2:52:53.920 --> 2:52:58.800]  bar and plan of the apes but we have to speak truth to power or we don't have the ability
[2:52:58.800 --> 2:53:03.840]  to reason anymore we lose the best qualities of the enlightenment and the renaissance and i'm not
[2:53:03.840 --> 2:53:07.680]  willing to go down like that well that's awesome that you're informed on all this and it's just
[2:53:07.680 --> 2:53:12.480]  amazing i just don't get how they they turn a champion of somebody trying to free the slaves
[2:53:12.480 --> 2:53:17.520]  early into the racist it's it's just great he was born into it he tried to end it and then he's the
[2:53:17.520 --> 2:53:23.840]  bad guy it's farenheit 451 they've got a demantle all of history and then they tell you benjamin
[2:53:23.840 --> 2:53:28.720]  franklin was the first firefighter and he was burning books you know instead of this great
[2:53:28.720 --> 2:53:33.120]  author and he did establish the first fire department to put out fires so it's they're
[2:53:33.120 --> 2:53:37.120]  really trying to dismantle all history so that they can retool and then they can tell us well
[2:53:37.120 --> 2:53:42.880]  the democrats have always been good and the kkk was a republican thing and you know blacks need
[2:53:42.880 --> 2:53:49.200]  to take a backseat uh now to you know uh uh you know what they want to do with south america and
[2:53:49.200 --> 2:53:53.920]  mexico and and and push us all together it's economically looking into your crystal ball
[2:53:53.920 --> 2:54:00.240]  alley alexander a smart guy uh what because i don't want to be too confident well let's look down
[2:54:00.240 --> 2:54:04.720]  into some of the more dangerous paths i don't want to give many ideas but i mean how do you think
[2:54:04.720 --> 2:54:09.280]  they could take out trump staging events false flags killing him i mean oh my god if they killed
[2:54:09.280 --> 2:54:15.200]  him that would that would really blow up i don't want that to happen well um i i'm actually surprised
[2:54:15.200 --> 2:54:22.240]  because something horrible has not happened yet uh we are in the trump leg of the uh the russia hopes
[2:54:22.240 --> 2:54:27.440]  so that's the good thing the good news is that we're about to have a very eventful summer um people
[2:54:27.440 --> 2:54:32.000]  are going to learn more of the realities of what's going on in the doj that the media has not told
[2:54:32.000 --> 2:54:34.960]  you and by the way i was about to say you tried to get into whistleblowers i apologize to get into
[2:54:34.960 --> 2:54:41.760]  that no no but but what what i think is that it's too late to take out trump but um they want to
[2:54:41.760 --> 2:54:46.800]  disable him and so they're putting people around him who will lie to him um they're they're telling
[2:54:46.800 --> 2:54:51.360]  him that he doesn't have this authority or that authority unfortunately mitch mcconnell is cooperating
[2:54:51.360 --> 2:54:56.560]  with a lot of this and so they're really trying to disable him but if we can get past november and we
[2:54:56.560 --> 2:55:01.920]  can maintain the house and the senate it's trump's show after that and i promise no one's seen nothing
[2:55:01.920 --> 2:55:06.880]  yet i mean it will look like a renaissance in america that we have not it will it will probably
[2:55:06.880 --> 2:55:12.800]  trump no pun intended the great awakening well my friend you're on fire and you're right it is the
[2:55:12.800 --> 2:55:18.160]  patriots in our government outside it it's all about saying no to the intimidation the bullying
[2:55:18.160 --> 2:55:22.720]  and the way you join trump right in the middle of the firestorm when when they were you know the
[2:55:22.720 --> 2:55:27.040]  entire cover of national review was saying you can't go with him anybody that signs that'll be
[2:55:27.040 --> 2:55:32.560]  blackballed forever well now national review is uh carrying trumps water more and more so
[2:55:32.560 --> 2:55:39.120]  i agree i think trump so far is now one at least the first phase uh but but now they're gonna try
[2:55:39.120 --> 2:55:45.200]  to sabotage him at every level yeah it's absolutely true and and and really i i would like for people
[2:55:45.200 --> 2:55:51.360]  to say a prayer for some of these rank and file career uh fbi agents and then uh lawyers inside
[2:55:51.360 --> 2:55:58.000]  the doj people don't understand that when some of these thugs started targeting trump's family he
[2:55:58.000 --> 2:56:03.120]  was fine taking these these these uh metaphorical bullets but when they started saying we're gonna
[2:56:03.120 --> 2:56:08.640]  lock up jerry kushner and his children are gonna grow up without a dad we're gonna lock up don jr
[2:56:09.200 --> 2:56:15.680]  trump christmas eve uh what i'm told uh went ballistic and he decided then that he was gonna
[2:56:15.680 --> 2:56:21.840]  fight fire with fire as much as he could and um thanks to him you know and david newness we got the
[2:56:21.840 --> 2:56:28.080]  memo and what i heard after the memo was that uh we had additional people go to the ig so the
[2:56:28.080 --> 2:56:32.560]  inspector general and start whistleblowing so think about it the the press is supposed to protect
[2:56:32.560 --> 2:56:37.920]  whistleblowers the senator is supposed to protect whistleblowers and these people were so intimidated
[2:56:37.920 --> 2:56:43.600]  by the the culture of corruption that comey created and the actual corruption that mccabe was
[2:56:43.600 --> 2:56:47.600]  creating that they didn't want to speak up they thought there was no champion well trump said
[2:56:47.600 --> 2:56:51.760]  i'll be a champion i'll protect my family and i'll protect yours that's right he took the gloves off
[2:56:51.760 --> 2:56:56.480]  and just like every other tyrant over reaches they've done it again alie alexander very impressed

[3:01:18.320 --> 3:01:22.640]  you know he said earlier in the speech he said this is very personal to me to get these cures in
[3:01:22.640 --> 3:01:28.720]  melania has not been seen in 17 18 days and they said oh it's not malignant or kidneys
[3:01:29.600 --> 3:01:32.640]  and i thought about something because i know a lot of eastern european folks
[3:01:32.640 --> 3:01:39.600]  who grew up in that area and i went wait a minute i looked at the gas plume and when malania
[3:01:41.920 --> 3:01:44.000]  was like about 12 years old
[3:01:46.080 --> 3:01:53.200]  or so cher noble went right over her and i know men and women that are from that area of the world
[3:01:53.200 --> 3:02:03.760]  and every person i know has had tumors i even know a woman that looks just like malania and she's
[3:02:03.760 --> 3:02:11.600]  had tumors three of them removed the joke is you know she's all i do i glow in the dark
[3:02:14.800 --> 3:02:17.520]  think about that and i'm not saying she's got something worse but
[3:02:17.520 --> 3:02:22.720]  but trump for the first time ever got a little tear in his eye he says it's very personal for me
[3:02:22.720 --> 3:02:30.080]  and the you know what trump it's it's it's serious you know silence a malania stokes conspiracy
[3:02:30.080 --> 3:02:38.240]  theories was i thought i saw two days ago 17 days so it's like 19 days now that doesn't sound good
[3:02:39.840 --> 3:02:44.720]  and god knows he they make fun of him eating McDonald's three times a day he has trusted
[3:02:44.720 --> 3:02:51.840]  people to go to different McDonald's and get his food because you think he can trust the food he's
[3:02:51.840 --> 3:02:57.440]  given you understand the level of the war we're in right now
[3:03:02.240 --> 3:03:03.680]  and i'm not going to get off into it
[3:03:03.680 --> 3:03:14.480]  but 18 years ago i went and spoke at a public event and i had feds trying to come up and say
[3:03:14.480 --> 3:03:19.280]  hey you want to plant what's now 20 days well you understand hey you want to plant bombs
[3:03:20.560 --> 3:03:25.120]  and all those stuff and i was like no no no and then i puffed all up that was back when i was
[3:03:25.120 --> 3:03:28.720]  still exercising really hard running on everything and i finally got my blood tested
[3:03:28.720 --> 3:03:36.640]  and they said yeah you got really bad levels arsenic in you and some jerk put arsenic at
[3:03:36.640 --> 3:03:43.920]  a public event in my tea so you read about the kings and every culture where you know the old
[3:03:43.920 --> 3:03:49.520]  roman emperors the japanese emperors the chinese emperors the african emperors everybody got poisoned
[3:03:49.520 --> 3:03:54.000]  they had food tasters you think they're trying to poison trump you think there aren't jacking with
[3:03:54.000 --> 3:03:59.360]  milania you think these people just don't coffee on top our heads they're out to get everybody and
[3:03:59.360 --> 3:04:03.600]  i'm not bitching about it but i want everybody to recognize roger stone and i talked to people
[3:04:03.600 --> 3:04:08.640]  that were involved he'd make this up i made him show me the stuff before they came to the gag
[3:04:08.640 --> 3:04:14.160]  order and i knew they'd do it you had the fed show up he got shot last year he even know what it was
[3:04:14.160 --> 3:04:19.200]  he goes yeah it slammed on my back he was like i can't find anything in me he got sick two days later
[3:04:19.200 --> 3:04:22.240]  from radiation policing but he didn't go all the way in through his he went through the shirt and
[3:04:22.240 --> 3:04:29.520]  deflected on his skin polonium they go oh look they killed the russian agent with polonium but it
[3:04:29.520 --> 3:04:35.680]  deflected roger aged i'd be honest about 10 years after that but they hit him with and then they
[3:04:35.680 --> 3:04:39.680]  t-boned him a few months later because they were going to blame him all along as the final guy he
[3:04:39.680 --> 3:04:45.040]  predicted that and now they've honed in he's the final guy they want to set up think about that
[3:04:45.840 --> 3:04:50.400]  they shoot you with polonium say that's how russians kill you and then set you up i'm telling you

[3:08:11.840 --> 3:08:17.360]  january because i was getting married and trump had literally just called my wife
[3:08:17.360 --> 3:08:24.640]  that day and then at like five a.m the next day my phone starts ringing
[3:08:28.160 --> 3:08:32.480]  and roger is throwing up everywhere and he's been to the hospital and he's got polonium in his
[3:08:32.480 --> 3:08:38.720]  blood and the fed show up and say don't talk about it and the media goes oh even though
[3:08:38.720 --> 3:08:43.920]  the fed showed up and grabbed the hospital records and told him not to talk roger claims it oh roger
[3:08:43.920 --> 3:08:48.000]  claims he's going to be the final guy they set up for russia gate that they want him dead so he
[3:08:48.000 --> 3:08:55.280]  can't testify to congress and now he's the final guy he's the guy they admit they're circling in on
[3:08:56.160 --> 3:09:04.400]  and it gets even better it gets even better they're now questioning army officers and others 13
[3:09:04.400 --> 3:09:10.400]  people and they go no alex it's sinning in on you and that you're a mastermind too talk about insane
[3:09:10.400 --> 3:09:14.240]  yeah i'm a mastermind when it comes to loving freedom and thinking you're going to want freedom
[3:09:14.240 --> 3:09:20.480]  over tyranny but there's no master mining crap i believe in you we put the idea out we throw the
[3:09:20.480 --> 3:09:26.160]  stone in the pond it comes back my mastermind i know when it's really still weather and you know

[3:09:33.360 --> 3:09:38.000]  i did this weekend i guess i am a mastermind i know that i don't go hunting the first week
[3:09:38.000 --> 3:09:42.240]  if it isn't freezing you know everybody else is out trying to shoot a big buck i go out and look

[3:09:49.520 --> 3:09:54.960]  sucker i guess i am a mastermind but it didn't mean the russians told me like oh drain the swamp

[3:10:00.080 --> 3:10:05.040]  season this really freaked roger's wife out and she had some issues with the hospital i'm not saying
[3:10:05.040 --> 3:10:09.040]  i did it but i said it because it's true we're in the season where they want to kill roger stone
[3:10:09.040 --> 3:10:15.440]  and kill me i don't say that for drama my god 20 30 articles a day new york times rolling stone

[3:10:35.120 --> 3:10:42.480]  and all this made-up stuff so i don't say all this to protect us in the main for our own individual
[3:10:42.480 --> 3:10:48.000]  selves i say it so that they don't twist the narrative if we get killed about what and who we
[3:10:48.000 --> 3:10:52.560]  were because we're men and we're we're not going to turn on the president we're not going to make
[3:10:52.560 --> 3:10:56.400]  things up against the president it's not going to happen and that's not even the story with all
[3:10:56.400 --> 3:11:00.880]  that stuff it's it's it's this the alex jones presidency the new york times and you know the
[3:11:00.880 --> 3:11:07.600]  war on alex jones the new republic it's here so this is where they're going and now that they're
[3:11:07.600 --> 3:11:15.680]  failing in their rage they want the low hanging fruit that is roger stone alex jones but as the
[3:11:15.680 --> 3:11:22.240]  wall street journal said three months ago now you know merging with disney they said we're
[3:11:22.240 --> 3:11:26.960]  going to get wiki leaks we're going to get alex jones we're going to mix isis in and once we've
[3:11:26.960 --> 3:11:34.080]  got them the left the next day had hundreds of articles oh the end of alex jones oh hold on to
[3:11:34.080 --> 3:11:39.040]  your tin full hat youtube's about to ban alex jones and it began a month later and only drudge
[3:11:39.840 --> 3:11:43.360]  sat there and showed we were being censored and showed the real video what we said so they wouldn't
[3:11:43.360 --> 3:11:52.800]  even be defamed but i read this thing the the legal war on alex jones and it out of the new
[3:11:52.800 --> 3:11:57.520]  republic and it's all these lies i didn't say it's not even quotes and it links to it just to
[3:11:57.520 --> 3:12:02.720]  defame me hoping some crazy person see they accused me trying to send crazy people to harass
[3:12:02.720 --> 3:12:06.720]  different groups out there they make that up but they are trying to send crazy people to kill us
[3:12:08.880 --> 3:12:13.040]  and they think i'm like them they think that it's going to make me back down or go away it's
[3:12:13.040 --> 3:12:20.320]  not but you make no mistake ladies and gentlemen we need you to flood info war store dot com with

[3:12:28.080 --> 3:12:32.480]  five dollars or go buy his book at info war store dot com stones rules you're already awake you're
[3:12:32.480 --> 3:12:36.960]  like hey we already get this but we need you to continue to take action but even more importantly
[3:12:36.960 --> 3:12:42.080]  we need you if they do kill us because i'm not worried about that i have responsibility i'm not
[3:12:42.080 --> 3:12:45.840]  suicidal i love life but at the same time there's this thing when you're a man you get to a certain
[3:12:45.840 --> 3:12:49.600]  point where you've already done so much stuff that responsibility is a big weight and you want to live
[3:12:49.600 --> 3:12:54.880]  a long time but at the same time you're not scared of dying it's it's it's it's it's real empowerment
[3:12:54.880 --> 3:13:02.400]  you just want to take care of your family after you're gone and you also wish you could keep fighting
[3:13:02.400 --> 3:13:06.320]  you know what i mean but you're not going to let them have the victory if they kill you but see i
[3:13:06.320 --> 3:13:10.960]  studied secret assassinations just my research and one of the main things the cia and other groups
[3:13:10.960 --> 3:13:15.920]  do is they have gelatin darts and they can put any poison they want in them and then they shoot you
[3:13:15.920 --> 3:13:20.160]  with a gelatin dart it's going to shoot you up close and then it dissolves into your body
[3:13:20.160 --> 3:13:25.920]  that just looks like background stuff so it doesn't pick up so it pierces you but then it dissolves
[3:13:25.920 --> 3:13:30.640]  they also have ice bullets and things we got to shoot somebody up closer with that and so roger
[3:13:30.640 --> 3:13:34.960]  just spend a few minutes then whatever topics you've got to take over here because i got the
[3:13:34.960 --> 3:13:38.720]  woods are lovely dark and deep my friend i want to stay home with you but i got miles ago before

[3:14:09.600 --> 3:14:16.240]  writing uh the manuscript for the making of the president 2016 which outlines the extraordinarily
[3:14:16.240 --> 3:14:24.000]  important role that info wars and other alternative media outlets played in the improbable election
[3:14:24.000 --> 3:14:32.080]  of dialed from i clearly got exceedingly ill i believe that i was hit by some kind of pride

[3:21:00.880 --> 3:21:08.640]  amazing and i'm super bad the immortal james brownberg is in all right roger you're taking over
[3:21:08.640 --> 3:21:12.080]  you've been called to the senate committee you knew it was coming they ignore all your
[3:21:12.080 --> 3:21:16.320]  statements on it and then when it happens they go oh look roger's in trouble oh he's called before
[3:21:16.320 --> 3:21:20.480]  him so all this is happening you're gonna be in studio next week hosting at least two days of
[3:21:20.480 --> 3:21:26.240]  the broadcast they are making me get out of the combat operation because i've gotten the point
[3:21:26.240 --> 3:21:30.240]  where i'm literally working 18 hours a day even from home i can't stop i can't do anything but work
[3:21:30.240 --> 3:21:36.160]  now so i'm gonna have to pull my engine for at least a week and so i'm gonna try my best uh take
[3:21:36.160 --> 3:21:41.920]  my babies sunbathing and fishing but i'll still be doing broadcast uh from the road uh just briefly
[3:21:43.040 --> 3:21:47.440]  listeners it's the epic future it's here it's real people like send me emails and make donations
[3:21:47.440 --> 3:21:51.520]  down they go i thought you were kidding that sorrelson hillary was suing you and it's like the
[3:21:51.520 --> 3:21:55.680]  democrats number one mission is to destroy you i actually read the wall street journal i actually
[3:21:55.680 --> 3:22:02.480]  read the new republic i why do they think you're so powerful i'm not they want to set the precedent
[3:22:02.480 --> 3:22:10.400]  with me to then destroy everybody else they've said it show voila the biggest thing we need
[3:22:10.400 --> 3:22:15.200]  is money they're censoring us they're blocking us they're banning us from advertising in four store
[3:22:15.200 --> 3:22:21.120]  dot com enforce life dot com but it's not about that if you just knew how good the products are
[3:22:21.840 --> 3:22:26.480]  if you just knew that nobody else puts as much product in here for the price that we do
[3:22:26.480 --> 3:22:32.480]  do everybody else does marketing and then it's marked up seven times on average ours is a hundred
[3:22:32.480 --> 3:22:39.360]  fifty percent off retail but we're always discounting so it's normally a hundred percent right now
[3:22:39.360 --> 3:22:45.520]  we got stuff at fifty percent markup some of it's lower let me explain what that means you get some
[3:22:45.520 --> 3:22:51.200]  of these products will sell right now and you do auto ship so ten percent soft some of them are
[3:22:51.200 --> 3:22:57.200]  breaking even nobody does that but i want to say i've got the best nutraceuticals at the best
[3:22:57.200 --> 3:23:03.360]  prices at the lowest prices when you buy it retail which they never read we're always twenty five percent
[3:23:03.360 --> 3:23:08.880]  off this is my own weird philosophy i didn't take marketing i just i do what i want to do i'll
[3:23:08.880 --> 3:23:13.120]  operate i know you want to see it's discounted so i already have a super low price hundred
[3:23:13.120 --> 3:23:19.360]  fifty percent markup average is seven times markup and then i cut it down twenty five percent off
[3:23:19.360 --> 3:23:23.600]  so off the total price it's like a hundred percent markup and when i discount it's off that
[3:23:24.160 --> 3:23:30.000]  right now folks some of these are right at cost try brain force try the real red pill plus now
[3:23:30.000 --> 3:23:35.120]  with energy try these products info or store.com but no you can't lose because you're funding the
[3:23:35.120 --> 3:23:41.120]  information war it's quite an epic battle quite frankly my life is not boring it's very very exciting
[3:23:41.120 --> 3:23:46.080]  info or store.com thank you all for your support read the thousands reviews per item uh because
[3:23:46.080 --> 3:23:50.320]  it's incredible but get some t-shirts while you're at it so you can experience what it's like to
[3:23:50.320 --> 3:23:55.840]  meet the patriots but also to see the enemy first on wear the uniform wear your colors fly your flag
[3:23:55.840 --> 3:24:00.400]  go out you go in a red state area your dinner bot might meet your next wife or your husband or your
[3:24:00.400 --> 3:24:08.160]  boyfriend but you wear it in the deep blue area you will be attacked so prepare yourself choose
[3:24:08.160 --> 3:24:12.560]  your own adventure all right so you got a lot to cover my friend but i want to finish up with you
[3:24:12.560 --> 3:24:16.880]  in this segment you take over um you're coming in here a few days next week to be hosting i want
[3:24:16.880 --> 3:24:20.560]  shroyers doing a great job as well the rest of the crew paul be back from vacation everybody's
[3:24:20.560 --> 3:24:25.680]  like where's paul you know he's with tony robinson you know he's going down here paul's got the same
[3:24:25.680 --> 3:24:28.800]  disease working 18 hours a day so he had to take off a week just so happened to be when this was
[3:24:28.800 --> 3:24:37.120]  happening uh the epicness of you though now being the epicenter and confirming orbiting that they're
[3:24:37.120 --> 3:24:42.640]  saying the fbi that you and i are the masterminds with trump and they're now leaving the russian
[3:24:42.640 --> 3:24:48.640]  narrative and saying that that no no no it's an american conspiracy so that's the two prong attack
[3:24:48.640 --> 3:24:55.360]  for my sources roger have you got any intel on that yeah i really have alex it gets more bizarre
[3:24:55.360 --> 3:25:03.040]  by the moment uh again months ago i agreed to testify for the house and uh pardon me for the
[3:25:03.040 --> 3:25:10.800]  senate intelligence and judiciary committees they have given us a document request that is so
[3:25:10.800 --> 3:25:17.840]  onerous so broad i am not exaggerating when i tell you that it will fill three tractor trailers
[3:25:17.840 --> 3:25:24.880]  full of paper but that's what they want and that is what they shall have uh there's no smoking guns
[3:25:24.880 --> 3:25:33.200]  in there if they're looking for the smoking gun it doesn't exist because there is no russian collusion
[3:25:33.200 --> 3:25:39.440]  but as you'll recall when i testified for the house committee i wanted to testify in public let
[3:25:39.440 --> 3:25:45.920]  the people see everything i have nothing to hide but no they wanted me to testify behind closed doors
[3:25:45.920 --> 3:25:54.320]  so they could then leak twisted bs right then when i did well what happens then but adam schiff
[3:25:54.320 --> 3:25:59.840]  and eric swalwell and the other democrats in the house democratic caucus say why didn't stone
[3:25:59.840 --> 3:26:05.440]  testify in public he's perjured himself well if people would be allowed to hear me speak they would
[3:26:05.440 --> 3:26:14.560]  see graphically that i testified fully completely and honestly this is the washington charade so uh i
[3:26:14.560 --> 3:26:22.160]  am more than happy to testify for the senate intelligence committee and the senate uh judiciary
[3:26:22.160 --> 3:26:28.640]  committee but i want to thank my friends at cnn who go out of their way to find the very worst
[3:26:28.640 --> 3:26:38.320]  photographs of me that they can possibly find it is so obvious and annoying there you go perfect
[3:26:38.320 --> 3:26:45.680]  example it doesn't even look like you it kind of looks like me i look like uh far more handsome than
[3:26:45.680 --> 3:26:52.880]  that i guarantee you so uh look there i i hope that they will listen to my request to testify in
[3:26:52.880 --> 3:27:00.240]  public it will be an extraordinary democratic experience uh and i'm calling on my supporters
[3:27:00.240 --> 3:27:06.640]  once we nail down the date in june uh if you're a supporter of donald trump if you're a supporter of
[3:27:06.640 --> 3:27:13.280]  roger stone if you're a supporter of info wars if you're a supporter of alex jones come to washington
[3:27:13.280 --> 3:27:22.000]  i want to see you in washington in numbers there is strength i have nothing whatsoever to hide i do
[3:27:22.000 --> 3:27:28.320]  get kind of tired of answering the same question over and over and over again that's my next question
[3:27:29.440 --> 3:27:33.280]  where is this going our listeners just think of russia gate but now it's coming to a head so it's
[3:27:33.280 --> 3:27:36.640]  important that's why i'm uncovering it there's nothing there and now to learn from all these
[3:27:36.640 --> 3:27:41.920]  witnesses we've talked to on unfair they're like tell us how jones and stone did this and tell us
[3:27:41.920 --> 3:27:46.560]  how they run the whole thing and it's like i want to build myself up don't get me wrong but
[3:27:47.200 --> 3:27:51.440]  this is cuckoo land they don't understand we have shared beliefs they don't get we have audiences
[3:27:51.440 --> 3:27:57.760]  that are americana they really think we're all like their average leftist slave oh and they ask
[3:27:57.760 --> 3:28:04.560]  questions like how often do jones and stone talk on the phone do they talk on signal do they talk on
[3:28:04.560 --> 3:28:11.440]  what's that is stone writing jones the material alex nobody writes your material somebody should be
[3:28:13.360 --> 3:28:19.840]  you know what do they like to drink what do they like to eat where do they hang out how often do
[3:28:19.840 --> 3:28:25.920]  you think they talk i mean these are unconstitutional questions maybe they're unfamiliar with the free
[3:28:25.920 --> 3:28:33.200]  assembly aspects of the constitution anyway we're on the alex jones show i'm roger stone that's alex
[3:28:33.200 --> 3:28:38.800]  jones and we will be right back that's right he'll take over what they don't get is it's all on air

[3:33:20.880 --> 3:33:32.960]  and now your host roger stone welcome back we're on the alex jones show and as i indicated the big
[3:33:32.960 --> 3:33:41.600]  news out of washington a glaring headline on the daily beast us senate intelligence committee
[3:33:41.600 --> 3:33:49.920]  wants to grill roger stone no roger stone wants to grill the us senate intelligence committee
[3:33:49.920 --> 3:33:56.960]  this really grows tedious i don't know how many times i have to answer the same questions about
[3:33:57.600 --> 3:34:07.040]  wiki leaks and gooseifer 2.0 and uh john podesta's emails and so on i've answered these questions
[3:34:07.600 --> 3:34:16.800]  ad nauseam there is no evidence whatsoever of wrongdoing just to be absolutely clear i had no
[3:34:16.800 --> 3:34:24.320]  advance notice of the content source or the exact disclosure deadline for the wiki leaks
[3:34:24.320 --> 3:34:32.640]  disclosures regarding the dnc uh and i had no advance notice of the publication of john podesta's
[3:34:32.640 --> 3:34:42.240]  extraordinarily embarrassing emails we recognize that this entire controversy is designed to distract
[3:34:42.240 --> 3:34:52.400]  from the content of those completely authentic disclosures and then more recently randy credico
[3:34:52.400 --> 3:35:01.040]  a former friend of mine goes on msnbc two nights ago and says julie anassange is willing to be
[3:35:01.040 --> 3:35:09.280]  questioned by the house democratic investigators under the direction of congressman adam schiff
[3:35:09.280 --> 3:35:17.520]  immediately congressman schiff says the only way he'd be willing to question or interrogate
[3:35:17.520 --> 3:35:24.400]  mr russage is if he's in u.s custody which is somewhat troubling because there are no known
[3:35:24.400 --> 3:35:33.760]  federal charges pending against mr russage unless of course mr schiff knows something that we
[3:35:33.760 --> 3:35:41.760]  don't know and then wiki leaks comes forward and says credico was never authorized to make
[3:35:41.760 --> 3:35:49.120]  such an offer this is a second lie that mr credico has been caught in the whole thing
[3:35:49.120 --> 3:35:58.080]  grows extraordinarily tedious there is no russian collusion i received nothing whatsoever from the
[3:35:58.080 --> 3:36:04.640]  uh from wiki leaks or the russians or julie anassange therefore i passed nothing on to
[3:36:04.640 --> 3:36:11.600]  donald trump or the trump campaign or anyone in the trump family uh and that includes receiving
[3:36:11.600 --> 3:36:19.920]  anything from the russians whoever that is they have beat this horse to death why because they
[3:36:19.920 --> 3:36:29.120]  are the ones who are guilty because they used a fabricated dossier as the underlying legal rationale
[3:36:29.120 --> 3:36:37.360]  for unconstitutional spying on the republican candidate for president and as we now know and
[3:36:37.360 --> 3:36:45.440]  was first revealed here on info wars the fbi infiltrated donald trump's presidential campaign
[3:36:45.440 --> 3:36:53.360]  now the washington post in the new york times would have us believe that they did so to search
[3:36:53.360 --> 3:37:02.160]  for evidence of russian collusion no they did so to play it faux evidence of russian collusion
[3:37:02.960 --> 3:37:10.960]  as part of what peter struck called in his text messages their insurance policy this is the greatest
[3:37:10.960 --> 3:37:20.480]  constitutional crisis in american history and the idea that rod rozenstein the acting attorney general
[3:37:20.480 --> 3:37:28.400]  the de facto attorney general refuses to turn over to congress the documents that outline
[3:37:28.400 --> 3:37:35.920]  where mr muller's authority comes from the fact that he refuses to turn over to the congress the
[3:37:35.920 --> 3:37:44.640]  details of the fisa warrants that were leveled on multiple members of the trump campaign well that
[3:37:44.640 --> 3:37:53.760]  is sedition you see a u.s citizen can only be subject to a fisa warren if they are actively
[3:37:53.760 --> 3:38:03.280]  involved in espionage on behalf of the foreign power against the united states this entire scandal
[3:38:03.280 --> 3:38:10.480]  makes watergate look like well a second rate burglary you see there's a difference is quite clear
[3:38:11.040 --> 3:38:19.120]  in the case of watergate nixon went down because he got caught having his campaign people spy on
[3:38:19.120 --> 3:38:27.040]  the opposition and because his campaign people infiltrated the campaign of his opponents but
[3:38:27.040 --> 3:38:35.200]  they at least used private individuals in this case the obama administration used the awesome power
[3:38:35.840 --> 3:38:43.280]  and the authority and the capability of the federal government to spy on the republican
[3:38:43.280 --> 3:38:51.440]  candidate for president how long will it be before the president's patients are exhausted
[3:38:51.440 --> 3:38:58.480]  it i am one who thinks there's been a great improvement in the president's response to all
[3:38:58.480 --> 3:39:08.560]  of this since he got himself a wartime conciliary in rudy juliani rudy juliani rusty is better than
[3:39:08.560 --> 3:39:16.640]  his previous lawyers because juliani has very effectively characterized the muller inquiry
[3:39:16.640 --> 3:39:24.960]  as a partisan witch hunt and we are in a situation where a terrific paper by professor
[3:39:24.960 --> 3:39:33.040]  steven calabrese yesterday of northwestern university outlines the unconstitutional
[3:39:33.040 --> 3:39:44.160]  underpinnings of muller's very appointment so if i am right and if having come up empty-handed with
[3:39:44.160 --> 3:39:53.600]  no evidence of russian collusion no evidence of witty leaks hijinks and robert muller seeks to
[3:39:53.600 --> 3:40:02.960]  frame me uh for some concocted offense in an attempt to leverage my testimony against the
[3:40:02.960 --> 3:40:13.680]  president as political has predicted let me say right now john dean i am not i will never
[3:40:13.680 --> 3:40:22.880]  betray this president i will never roll on this president i will never backstab this president
[3:40:23.440 --> 3:40:30.880]  unlike so many others in washington but they're counting on the fact that i don't have the money
[3:40:30.880 --> 3:40:39.040]  to fight this federal legal juggernaut and that's why i must appeal to you to go to stone defense

[3:47:31.120 --> 3:47:40.240]  for 6.3 million dollars i only wish i read an extraordinary article in the intercept called
[3:47:40.240 --> 3:47:49.920]  bread to suffer about the extraordinary medical experiments that are being conducted on man's
[3:47:49.920 --> 3:47:57.120]  best friend that's right dogs and cats who are being subject to some of the most brutal torture
[3:47:57.120 --> 3:48:06.080]  the most bizarre quasi medical experiments that you can possibly imagine oh and shawyer and i at
[3:48:06.080 --> 3:48:13.040]  the war room have been in the forefront working with the very good people at white coat labs project
[3:48:13.040 --> 3:48:21.520]  to stop this inhumane treatment of man's best friend but this story absolutely blew my mind
[3:48:21.520 --> 3:48:31.360]  to find out that the federal government abused over 60 000 dogs last year and over 820 000
[3:48:31.360 --> 3:48:39.120]  thousand individual innocent animals the kind of experiments we're talking about are nauseating
[3:48:39.120 --> 3:48:48.720]  having holes drilled in their heads so to be filled with drugs subjecting them to crystal
[3:48:48.720 --> 3:49:00.320]  meth uh subjecting them to toxic fumes uh removing their eyes removing their vocal cords and then
[3:49:00.320 --> 3:49:09.040]  of course refusing to let anybody uh adopt these animals this is a disgrace the white house telephone
[3:49:09.040 --> 3:49:25.520]  number 2024561414 let's put it up here 2024561414 please call the white house now and ask them to
[3:49:25.520 --> 3:49:34.640]  stop the inhumane bizarre treatment of man's best friend and the experiments on dogs by the
[3:49:34.640 --> 3:49:41.920]  federal government these experiments have no scientific value whatsoever and they must stop
[3:49:42.960 --> 3:49:51.120]  one thing i was remiss about yesterday uh was to mention how proud i was to see uh president
[3:49:51.120 --> 3:49:59.040]  trump talk about our american veterans and those who have given their lives in their service of
[3:49:59.040 --> 3:50:07.280]  their country one individual stands out who is still with us and must be acknowledged as a true
[3:50:07.920 --> 3:50:20.320]  american hero my old boss senator bob dole of kansas 91 years old recently received the congressional
[3:50:20.320 --> 3:50:28.320]  medal of honor a true american patriot when the bush family turned tail and abandoned

[3:52:59.920 --> 3:53:07.520]  very much there is a limited availability uh so please go to the info wars dot com store now
[3:53:07.520 --> 3:53:18.400]  and order your copy of stones rules there's a little question that i am going to be called
[3:53:18.400 --> 3:53:24.720]  before the senate intelligence committee what they don't seem to understand is that i relish
[3:53:24.720 --> 3:53:32.320]  this opportunity that i want to testify i'd also like to testify in front of the senate
[3:53:32.320 --> 3:53:39.120]  judiciary committee but i don't see what there is to hide why can't we have these proceedings
[3:53:39.120 --> 3:53:46.960]  in open like the watergate hearings or the army mccarthy hearings of the 1950s what are they
[3:53:46.960 --> 3:53:55.520]  trying to hide i'd like to take on frontally the entire question of russian collusion i'd like
[3:53:55.520 --> 3:54:03.840]  to destroy the myths about alex jones and roger stone and how we are plotting with latimer putin
[3:54:03.840 --> 3:54:11.760]  to win the election because this is nonsense of course i'm guessing they will want me to testify
[3:54:11.760 --> 3:54:19.760]  behind closed doors that way the democrats can come out of the meeting and leak things you didn't say
[3:54:19.760 --> 3:54:28.960]  put words in your mouth cast aspersions on your remarks i've seen this graphically in the house
[3:54:28.960 --> 3:54:35.520]  committee hearings where members of the minority said that stone didn't answer certain questions no
[3:54:35.520 --> 3:54:45.760]  i answered every single question honestly and truthfully so as soon as we know a june day and
[3:54:45.760 --> 3:54:52.480]  it appears it will be in june because the documents that the senate intelligence committee
[3:54:52.480 --> 3:55:00.640]  has requested will fill three trailer trucks full of paper and they need some time to digest
[3:55:00.640 --> 3:55:08.320]  that material i will be more than happy come to washington and lay it all out for the american
[3:55:08.320 --> 3:55:16.320]  people in fact i'm already beginning to think about what i'm going to wear i really hope
[3:55:16.320 --> 3:55:23.600]  that this opportunity comes to pass and that the senate in its wisdom will allow this hearing to
[3:55:23.600 --> 3:55:32.000]  be in public in the meantime one more time remember that we faced the greatest fight in info wars
[3:55:32.000 --> 3:55:40.400]  history there is an insidious globalist plot run by the tech left that intends to shut us down
[3:55:41.280 --> 3:55:51.040]  when i take the buy link from amazon or info wars or barns and noble and i seek to put it into a paid
[3:55:51.040 --> 3:55:58.560]  facebook promotion well my ad is rejected how could that be there's no inappropriate content
[3:55:58.560 --> 3:56:06.240]  in my book no this is an insidious effort to kneecap anyone on the right they're doing it to alex
[3:56:06.240 --> 3:56:12.000]  jones they're doing it to oan schreuer they're doing it to david night they're doing it to roger
[3:56:12.000 --> 3:56:18.960]  stone they're doing it to millie weaver they're doing it to the entire crew here at info wars
[3:56:18.960 --> 3:56:25.120]  don't let them get away with it folks here's what you can do when you see a story at info wars that

[3:56:48.960 --> 3:56:55.280]  regarding rosa and bar or whether it is the truth of what's happening to tommy robinson
[3:56:55.280 --> 3:57:05.040]  or whether it is the efforts to uh let us say shadow ban alex jones tell people in your circle
