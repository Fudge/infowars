[00:00.000 --> 00:16.800]  Here we are again live April 13th, 1922 on this Wednesday edition.
[00:16.800 --> 00:25.920]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:25.920 --> 00:41.040]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:41.040 --> 00:48.920]  What an epic time to be alive on this beautiful blue jewel, hurdling through God's creation.
[00:48.920 --> 00:55.520]  Again, thank you so much for joining us on this live April 13th, Wednesday Transmission.
[00:55.520 --> 01:00.960]  I am your host, Alex Jones, here captaining the embattled Good Ship Infowars.
[01:00.960 --> 01:05.160]  We'll be here for the next four hours ahead of the war room with Owen Schreuer at 3 p.m.
[01:05.160 --> 01:06.160]  Central today.
[01:06.160 --> 01:10.520]  I have a special guest in studio, also intend to open the phones up.
[01:10.520 --> 01:14.040]  Let me just give you a quick rundown of the incredible stories.
[01:14.040 --> 01:20.800]  We have the corporate press in overdrive scrambling hysterically, trying to hide the fact that
[01:20.800 --> 01:26.600]  the New York City subway shooter was targeting white people because he believed they needed
[01:26.600 --> 01:36.400]  to die and he also wanted to kill black people that married outside of the African bloodline.
[01:36.400 --> 01:41.240]  Obviously completely mentally ill, out of his mind from his postings, I've watched several
[01:41.240 --> 01:45.480]  videos this morning, he was mumbling and saying things while he shot people, that's reported
[01:45.480 --> 01:47.280]  by witnesses.
[01:47.280 --> 01:52.520]  We don't blame black people for what he did, we don't blame someone for the color of their
[01:52.520 --> 01:58.080]  skin for what somebody else, the same skin has done.
[01:58.080 --> 02:03.600]  But the media does when it's Dillon Roof, also completely mentally ill, also mumbling
[02:03.600 --> 02:08.640]  incoherently and saying similar things, but from a white perspective, when he went into
[02:08.640 --> 02:13.520]  an innocent black church and killed nine people at point blank range and injured others, every
[02:13.520 --> 02:18.960]  white person in America was guilty and every gun owner was guilty, the corporate media
[02:18.960 --> 02:24.720]  told us for months and beat us over the head with it.
[02:24.720 --> 02:29.320]  We don't blame white people for what that deranged mentally ill person did, the answer
[02:29.320 --> 02:34.600]  is arming churchgoers, having armed deacons and that's been stopping these shooters dead
[02:34.600 --> 02:40.240]  in their tracks and that's why we have crime rates four, five, ten times higher in places
[02:40.240 --> 02:46.760]  like Chicago, New York, and other areas, D.C., that have taken the guns.
[02:46.760 --> 02:53.760]  The answer, ladies and gentlemen, is more armed citizens than the statistics show that,
[02:53.760 --> 02:59.760]  but here it is, what a sterling example of the corporate control, New York City shooter
[02:59.760 --> 03:04.520]  Frank James is a black nationalist like the Waukesha parade killer, but remember the media
[03:04.520 --> 03:10.440]  said a truck did that, a car did that, it was a truck attack, recently released a video
[03:10.440 --> 03:16.800]  manifesto posted video on the new Supreme Court Justice saying he hates her because
[03:16.800 --> 03:24.280]  he's married to a white devil, absolutely mentally ill, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:24.280 --> 03:29.720]  Oh black Jesus please kill all the whiteies, Brooklyn shooting person of interest, Frank
[03:29.720 --> 03:36.080]  James made anti-white post on social media, here he is dressed up in skull outfits, he
[03:36.080 --> 03:40.360]  has been in and out of the mental health system, was completely schizophrenic, just like Dylan
[03:40.360 --> 03:46.440]  Roof's been diagnosed schizophrenic, completely out of his mind, not the gun's fault, not
[03:46.440 --> 03:51.160]  his black skin's fault, not Dylan Roof's white skin fault, not his black skin's fault,
[03:51.160 --> 03:57.280]  not Dylan Roof's white skin fault, not his white skin fault, not his white skin fault,
[03:57.280 --> 04:04.040]  not Dylan Roof's white skin fault, not the gun's fault, the mental illnesses fault,
[04:04.040 --> 04:09.080]  the demonic possessions fault, whatever you want to call it, but here it is, inside Frank
[04:09.080 --> 04:15.120]  James chilling bullets and body bags post before subway shooting, this person of interest
[04:15.120 --> 04:23.840]  says we're in World War three, I came face to face with the mumbling Brooklyn subway
[04:23.840 --> 04:27.720]  shooter, New York Post has a witness talking about it, didn't even know really where he
[04:27.720 --> 04:34.160]  was or what he was doing, full on lunatic land, just like Dylan Roof, didn't know who
[04:34.160 --> 04:38.360]  he was and was gibbering to police, but that was in the back of the paper with him, no
[04:38.360 --> 04:44.400]  it was all premeditated and it was all white people's fault, that's the reason this happened,
[04:44.400 --> 04:49.280]  no it is not my fault when somebody that looks like me does something wrong, it's my fault
[04:49.280 --> 04:55.440]  when I do something wrong, but see, authoritarians always blame whole groups, not just the left
[04:55.440 --> 05:03.880]  does, they're sick and they're evil, it was about 25 years ago that I wanted to expand
[05:03.880 --> 05:07.600]  in for a war, so I've been on the air a couple of years but I only had money to finance my
[05:07.600 --> 05:12.120]  own simple little local radio show and I wanted to hire camera people, I wanted to make films,
[05:12.120 --> 05:16.240]  I wanted to really challenge the globalist and it was a t-shirt I designed, the first
[05:16.240 --> 05:22.000]  one, mass murderers agree gun control works, that helped us finance hiring the first three
[05:22.000 --> 05:26.480]  members of my crew, that's our oldest design and we still sell it, we have that design
[05:26.480 --> 05:31.080]  over a hundred others that will now all be limited editions, because whatever stock we've
[05:31.080 --> 05:36.560]  got in, that's it, we're selling everything out to fund the operation, to get rid of inventory,
[05:36.560 --> 05:40.280]  we'll still have some teachers in the future, they'll just be limited editions and short
[05:40.280 --> 05:44.880]  runs, so if you want to get any of these historic shirts, this is your last chance, I almost
[05:44.880 --> 05:52.560]  got, we're selling them all at cost at infowarstore.com, every ball cap, every flag, every hoodie,
[05:52.560 --> 05:56.600]  every long sleeve, every t-shirt, regular shirts, designer shirts, they're all selling
[05:56.600 --> 06:16.960]  at cost, infowarstore.com, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex
[06:16.960 --> 06:24.400]  Jones, it's Wednesday April 13th, 2022, I'm your host Alex Jones, I intend to open the
[06:24.400 --> 06:29.360]  phones up in the second hour, and then Ali Alexander joins us with Breaking Intel, in
[06:29.360 --> 06:32.840]  studio in the third hour, you'll definitely want to stay with us for that, and of course
[06:32.840 --> 06:37.360]  the, another great guest host coming up in the fourth hour, head of Owen Schreuer and
[06:37.360 --> 06:44.440]  the War Room, 3PM Central today, here on the Embattled Info Wars Network, okay, let me tell
[06:44.440 --> 06:47.680]  you what's coming up today, we've got some really good news, some bad news, and some
[06:47.680 --> 06:52.760]  ugly news, but it's all incredibly important to know news, first off it's such a bell
[06:52.760 --> 06:58.440]  weather and an illustration of how the system is collapsed and discredited, CNN owned by
[06:58.440 --> 07:10.680]  AT&T and Time Warner, spent 300 million dollars, just in the launch of CNN Plus, they spent
[07:10.680 --> 07:17.600]  another 100 million in infrastructure at CNN, building the studios, that's 400 million dollars,
[07:17.600 --> 07:25.000]  and a year's planning, and it has, wait for it, it's launched the last two weeks, first
[07:25.000 --> 07:30.160]  week had about 7,000 viewers, the next week had about 10,000 viewers, I'm going to explain
[07:30.160 --> 07:38.760]  that again, I have all the ratings right here, less than 10,000 people tuned in to a 400
[07:38.760 --> 07:46.120]  million dollar enterprise, ladies and gentlemen, a B rated AM radio station in a mid-sized
[07:46.120 --> 07:54.720]  city has 10,000 listeners an hour, we on terrestrial radio, according to the ratings by the ad
[07:54.720 --> 08:01.240]  agencies that get aggregates of the arbitron, get over 3 million a day, very conservatively
[08:01.240 --> 08:07.240]  on talk radio, the bigger shows like Limbaugh 20 million when he was around, coast to coast
[08:07.240 --> 08:12.960]  AM, 15, 16 million, George Norrie is huge, but oh, nobody cares, let's just talk radio,
[08:12.960 --> 08:18.000]  nobody cares about Limbaugh or George Norrie or Glenn Beck, or Alex Jones, because most
[08:18.000 --> 08:23.440]  of the stations don't subscribe to the ratings, so they're not added to the ratings basically,
[08:23.440 --> 08:30.440]  but our rated stations, 3 plus million a day, and then on the internet, conservatively, 3
[08:30.440 --> 08:35.040]  million again, at our height that was 10 million, 20 million a day, as big as Limbaugh, but
[08:35.040 --> 08:39.800]  they censored us and crushed us down, folks have to know how to find us at infowars.com,
[08:39.800 --> 08:48.320]  forward slash show, but my point is, we operate on 25 million dollars a year, we have to sell
[08:48.320 --> 08:55.480]  60 million dollars worth of product on average to be able to then get money to fund ourselves,
[08:55.480 --> 09:03.440]  to break even, we got to sell 60 million dollars worth of product, and some years we haven't,
[09:03.440 --> 09:07.560]  but I did things like take some of the money we raised in the years and invest it in real
[09:07.560 --> 09:12.240]  estate to be able to then sell that real estate when I knew I'd need it down the road to dump
[09:12.240 --> 09:17.760]  it back in the operation, and I've already done that, so I'm down to my last chips here,
[09:17.760 --> 09:23.480]  but not because we're not popular, imagine this, we're operating on 27 million a year,
[09:23.480 --> 09:28.160]  we're operating on 27 million dollars a year with our own servers, own satellites, own
[09:28.160 --> 09:38.160]  crew, own legal, with all the attacks, our own infrastructure, and CNN Plus launched
[09:38.160 --> 09:46.440]  with 400 million dollars and has less than 10,000 viewers a week.
[09:46.440 --> 09:50.720]  You can start looking show yourself on YouTube and if it's half decent, within a week you'll
[09:50.720 --> 09:53.120]  have 10,000 views guaranteed.
[09:53.120 --> 09:59.520]  I mean a dead cat could get more viewers with a webcam on it in the middle of the street
[09:59.520 --> 10:02.320]  than CNN can.
[10:02.320 --> 10:05.680]  Everyone can't stand CNN.
[10:05.680 --> 10:11.120]  What did old Joe Rogan say about it?
[10:11.120 --> 10:15.000]  Joe had a great way of saying it this morning, I don't usually get into his text on air,
[10:15.000 --> 10:20.440]  but this one really says it well, they were foolish thinking they would get people to
[10:20.440 --> 10:27.280]  pay money for something they don't like for free, and he says they spent 300 million on
[10:27.280 --> 10:34.280]  it, I looked it up, it was actually 400 million, and that's absolutely true, isn't it?
[10:34.280 --> 10:40.520]  So I'm going to be getting into that, and what does that illustrate?
[10:40.520 --> 10:47.400]  Their top shows have 800,000 viewers in prime time, their average show about 100,000 viewers.
[10:47.400 --> 10:53.520]  With billions of year funding them, we have on average, I had them to the numbers, 4.7
[10:53.520 --> 10:55.560]  million views a day on Band-Aid video.
[10:55.560 --> 10:59.880]  You're like, wait a minute, you just said you have 3 million views a day.
[10:59.880 --> 11:04.600]  Our streams are separate, then we have some videos on Band-Aid video, I don't count the
[11:04.600 --> 11:09.440]  other views, I'm talking about other people's views, and all the views on Band-Aid video
[11:09.440 --> 11:15.360]  is 4.7 million in the last month on average a day, some days as much as 9 million, so
[11:15.360 --> 11:21.120]  it averages out, so we've got 4 plus million viewers a day on Band-Aid video, millions
[11:21.120 --> 11:27.400]  tuning into our streams every day, millions on talk radio, and we're operating on $27
[11:27.400 --> 11:29.400]  million.
[11:29.400 --> 11:43.200]  They can't get 10,000 views a week on $400 million.
[11:43.200 --> 11:46.360]  Now you know why they're having summits talking about how they want to silence me and Joe
[11:46.360 --> 11:48.200]  Rogan and Tucker Carlson.
[11:48.200 --> 11:52.800]  Now you know why they're censoring, because no one likes them, they've been rejected,
[11:52.800 --> 11:54.800]  they're a fraud.
[11:54.800 --> 12:00.760]  A federal jury just found not guilty all the patsies in Michigan in the Whitmer kidnapping
[12:00.760 --> 12:01.760]  plot.
[12:01.760 --> 12:03.960]  The FBI ran it.
[12:03.960 --> 12:07.880]  Juries are now acquitting and releasing Jan 6th defendants that are finally getting
[12:07.880 --> 12:08.880]  to court.
[12:08.880 --> 12:11.480]  Judges are releasing them.
[12:11.480 --> 12:13.880]  Black Lives Matter goes and attacks CNN.
[12:13.880 --> 12:16.720]  They know who the enemy is, even though they're run by the globalists.
[12:16.720 --> 12:21.080]  Their own people aren't buying the Kool-Aid.
[12:21.080 --> 12:22.080]  That's one of the big stories.
[12:22.080 --> 12:25.560]  We have the mass shooting, the media trying to cover it up, we're going to get to all
[12:25.560 --> 12:26.560]  of it.
[12:26.560 --> 12:31.760]  We've got huge economic developments, massive Biden developments over the top, information
[12:31.760 --> 12:37.240]  on the war and what's developing there, huge pedophile and grooming news, the biggest
[12:37.240 --> 12:42.280]  yet ever massive censorship news, Elon Musk battling back, I've got the inside baseball
[12:42.280 --> 12:47.240]  on that, a while back, but I've been asked not to say anything about it.
[12:47.240 --> 12:51.680]  That's why I told you about a year ago, I said, Musk claims he's going to take on the
[12:51.680 --> 12:52.680]  new world order.
[12:52.680 --> 12:53.680]  I don't know if that's true.
[12:53.680 --> 12:58.480]  I've been on the fence about the guy, but now he's starting to prove himself.
[12:58.480 --> 13:01.280]  And he lives right here in Austin, I'll just leave it at that.
[13:01.280 --> 13:04.640]  And I run with people that run with him on a weekly basis.
[13:04.640 --> 13:07.040]  And that's just what I've been told.
[13:07.040 --> 13:11.680]  So you're actually seeing what I was told was going to happen.
[13:11.680 --> 13:13.680]  So this is one hell of a time to be alive, folks.
[13:13.680 --> 13:17.840]  And it's not like Musk or anybody's perfect, he just sees the old establishment's dying.
[13:17.840 --> 13:20.240]  Why would you stay on that ship?
[13:20.240 --> 13:21.800]  And that leads us to this point.
[13:21.800 --> 13:24.880]  Info wars is doing the most important work it's ever done.
[13:24.880 --> 13:29.240]  And I'm always up here having to scrabble to get money just to stay on the air when
[13:29.240 --> 13:33.960]  we're having our most important work ever and it'll become more authoritative and more
[13:33.960 --> 13:37.560]  influential in intellectual circles around the world.
[13:37.560 --> 13:42.720]  So your investment in info wars is always paying off in freedom and liberty and awakening.
[13:42.720 --> 13:44.680]  And it's paying off better day by day.
[13:44.680 --> 13:48.680]  It's like a pregnancy that's eight and a half months in, you're about to get the baby.
[13:48.680 --> 13:49.960]  It's about to be healthy.
[13:49.960 --> 13:53.520]  All the works coming in now were in the birth pains.
[13:53.520 --> 13:58.840]  But I can tell you, I have almost spent half the reserve money I had that was just like
[13:58.840 --> 14:00.200]  $4 million.
[14:00.200 --> 14:02.320]  For a company this important, that was nothing.
[14:02.320 --> 14:08.600]  I had $4 million five months ago and I got 2.3 million right now.
[14:08.600 --> 14:11.320]  So I guess half, almost.
[14:11.320 --> 14:15.760]  And those are my undridges and we need everybody we've got working here and I'm not bitching
[14:15.760 --> 14:16.760]  or complaining.
[14:16.760 --> 14:20.720]  But why should we have layoffs when everything we said is coming true and we're winning?
[14:20.720 --> 14:23.960]  I've got all the Democrat lawsuits coming to a head with trials this summer.
[14:23.960 --> 14:24.960]  I've got to pay for all that.
[14:24.960 --> 14:29.480]  I've got judges doing all these fake sanctions on me massively that top law firms say they've
[14:29.480 --> 14:33.560]  never seen and they break the law but if I don't pay them they'll have me arrested.
[14:33.560 --> 14:37.200]  I mean we're under massive attack because we've entered the thick of the battle, the
[14:37.200 --> 14:40.080]  key gladiatorial event that's going to decide so much.
[14:40.080 --> 14:44.560]  So now your whole investment could really be damaged in liberty if you let them take
[14:44.560 --> 14:45.920]  down this standard of freedom.
[14:45.920 --> 14:52.280]  I need everybody seriously to get off the fence and go to infowarstore.com.
[14:52.280 --> 14:53.280]  You hear the ads?
[14:53.280 --> 14:56.280]  Most of those are for the network and local stations.

[15:01.360 --> 15:06.400]  So go there, get books, get films, get t-shirts, get air filtration, water filtration.

[15:41.160 --> 15:45.400]  who have never gotten a product and get a piece of history and fund the info war and

[20:02.320 --> 20:21.480]  on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[20:21.480 --> 20:25.640]  well we took on the new world order we took on the globalist we exposed how they operate
[20:25.640 --> 20:31.880]  using pedophile rings and narcotics trafficking and so much more and really nobody was talking
[20:31.880 --> 20:37.400]  about this stuff when we were breaking it down 25 years ago but I didn't discover this
[20:37.400 --> 20:42.920]  myself it was the original patriots that were aware of how the whole system really operated
[20:42.920 --> 20:47.080]  and I could list off all their names but I've already done that but I got a chance to interview
[20:47.080 --> 20:55.080]  those men many many many many many times on this very broadcast and it was mainly men
[20:55.080 --> 21:04.120]  and they were prestigious as well congressman former directors deputy directors of the FBI
[21:04.120 --> 21:10.080]  former top generals head of the air force weapons development head of the heart program
[21:10.080 --> 21:13.360]  and they knew what was going on and I thought it was fantastical but I knew part of it was
[21:13.360 --> 21:17.160]  true because I'd done my own research and knew that most of what they were saying was true
[21:17.160 --> 21:22.080]  I couldn't disprove the other things and later I found out it was all real to some people
[21:22.080 --> 21:27.080]  tuning in here I think it sounds crazy and then so much of it ends up being true boy
[21:27.080 --> 21:33.640]  do I wish I was wrong about most of this I wish I was wrong but 98% of the time we're
[21:33.640 --> 21:39.840]  not wrong and the question is people face the horror of what we're dealing with to stop
[21:39.840 --> 21:46.600]  this all right I want to get into the censorship in the last segment of this hour already mentioned
[21:46.600 --> 21:52.160]  it but it's really a big deal and it ties in to the zombie nature of CNN me CNN's had
[21:52.160 --> 21:57.920]  no viewers for really five six years but billions are pumped in a year why is that well it speaks
[21:57.920 --> 22:04.240]  to a lot and it's really a bellwether or a sign of where the establishment in Hollywood
[22:04.240 --> 22:09.200]  the whole combine is they know they're dead they know no one's listening they know they've
[22:09.200 --> 22:14.480]  already lost that's why they're trying to overturn the chessboard and fully gas like
[22:14.480 --> 22:20.080]  the American people in some hope that if society implodes enough that people will forget all
[22:20.080 --> 22:26.600]  the crimes and lies and brainwashing that they have been engaged in but let's get to
[22:26.600 --> 22:39.120]  this big piece of news right now Dylan roof Charleston 2015 in June he goes into an innocent
[22:39.120 --> 22:44.600]  black church of people he never met and didn't know who'd done nothing to him and he shot
[22:44.600 --> 22:50.680]  more than 15 people killing nine and they reported the police said that he was gibbering incoherently
[22:50.680 --> 22:56.600]  and appeared to be schizophrenic that matter they said all white people were to blame and
[22:56.600 --> 23:03.520]  that all gun owners were to blame no I'm not to blame and white people are not to blame
[23:03.520 --> 23:10.280]  this lunatic is to blame just like the new york subway shooter frank james who shot more
[23:10.280 --> 23:15.840]  than 16 people many in critical condition is a black nationalist like walk a shop parade
[23:15.840 --> 23:23.400]  killer recently released video manifesto posted video of the new supreme court justice saying
[23:23.400 --> 23:32.760]  he doesn't like her because she's married to a white person another gibbering crazy
[23:32.760 --> 23:38.480]  lunatic do we blame black people no we don't blame black people but who do we blame we
[23:38.480 --> 23:43.960]  blame the corporate media and we blame the establishment stirring up all this hate and
[23:43.960 --> 23:48.600]  we blame them covering up the fact that black on white crime is at least 10 times white
[23:48.600 --> 23:52.400]  on black crime because the media promotes that white people are bad and deserve to be
[23:52.400 --> 23:56.880]  mugged and attacked and many black leaders even where I live in texas say don't rob
[23:56.880 --> 24:01.840]  in your neighborhood go rob white people how about you don't rob or kill anybody how about
[24:01.840 --> 24:14.040]  that unbelievable so I don't have to remind you what happened on the subway yesterday
[24:14.040 --> 24:21.480]  or the tear gas he used and all the craziness the point is this guy was out of his mind
[24:21.480 --> 24:25.840]  and the media is still not pointing out that he was a black supremacist even though we
[24:25.840 --> 24:32.120]  have the videos linked in articles on info wars dot com where his youtube is still active
[24:32.120 --> 24:36.520]  by the way I'm saying don't censor him we need to hear what people like Adolf Hitler
[24:36.520 --> 24:46.760]  said or Joseph Stalin said or Mao say tongue said or Kim Jong Un said or this individual
[24:46.760 --> 24:53.120]  black nationalist Frank James because once we hear what they have to say we can respond
[24:53.120 --> 24:58.440]  and know what's going on kill all whitey suspect in Brooklyn subway shooting spotted
[24:58.440 --> 25:07.120]  hateful black nationalist rhetoric praised beautiful 9 11 turns out it was on FBI terror
[25:07.120 --> 25:14.320]  list and the agents had tried to investigate him but the investigation was killed outrage
[25:14.320 --> 25:20.760]  eruptor FBI didn't stop kill whitey shooting suspect because they don't have mental institutions
[25:20.760 --> 25:27.120]  anymore they just let these folks run around on the street whether it's Dylan roof or whether
[25:27.120 --> 25:35.240]  it's this lunatic but ask yourselves why are you not hearing about him being a black nationalist
[25:35.240 --> 25:39.640]  or wanting to kill whites why do you got to go to info wars dot com to find that or gateway
[25:39.640 --> 25:45.920]  pundit or Breitbart or I'm sure Tucker Carlson tonight because the corporate media follows
[25:45.920 --> 25:52.760]  its orders they say men are women and women are men and when a black crazy person goes
[25:52.760 --> 25:58.120]  out and kills white people well it's just forget the story and move on but when a white lunatic
[25:58.120 --> 26:01.760]  goes out and kills the black folks let's put salt in the wound and rub it in and make it
[26:01.760 --> 26:07.120]  a huge deal to create more division where the Democrats then poses the saviors of the democratic
[26:07.120 --> 26:11.200]  party but here's the really big news I'm gonna get to a special report that just premiered
[26:11.200 --> 26:17.600]  last hour to info wars dot com by Greg Reese ties into this remember the two days into
[26:17.600 --> 26:22.440]  Biden's stolen administration in January of 2021 they get up there and press conferences
[26:22.440 --> 26:26.600]  and they say white people and white supremacist the number one threat and what is the white
[26:26.600 --> 26:31.400]  supremacist someone that questions lock downs forced inoculations open borders or election
[26:31.400 --> 26:35.120]  fraud and they put out the national strategy for countering domestic terrorism that I've
[26:35.120 --> 26:40.840]  harped on then a month ago the FBI puts on an official battle plan saying they're spitting
[26:40.840 --> 26:46.000]  the majority of their money per capita on any terrorism on white people and they put
[26:46.000 --> 26:52.840]  out all these alerts what's a terrorist position and opposition to covid measures claims of
[26:52.840 --> 26:59.240]  election fraud see how that works I was put on NBC news Fox News everywhere but see the
[26:59.240 --> 27:06.560]  wheels are coming off the Whitmer fraud millions and millions spent going out and canvassing
[27:06.560 --> 27:13.360]  Michigan to find mainly young white men who came from fatherless homes who were looking
[27:13.360 --> 27:18.880]  for male role models and who were upset about the decline of America and wanted to train
[27:18.880 --> 27:24.000]  with firearms to be basically in the military without joining and they typecast they spent
[27:24.000 --> 27:29.840]  years setting them up they activated them and ordered them the FBI was recorded this themselves
[27:29.840 --> 27:36.640]  got into evidence ordered them to attack Whitmer's house ordered them to kidnap her ordered them
[27:36.640 --> 27:41.720]  to cut her head off and they're on tape no no I don't want to but the FBI agents and
[27:41.720 --> 27:46.440]  informants muscle them and command them and order them to at least show up and run around
[27:46.440 --> 27:51.920]  at night in the bushes by her house so they could then say she was a victim when people
[27:51.920 --> 27:57.520]  wanted to impeach her during the lockdowns and the same FBI team that did that then ran
[27:57.520 --> 28:07.080]  January 6th that's why the FBI comes to talk to you about January 6th as he's being set
[28:07.080 --> 28:10.840]  up right now for me to do I'm doing a proffer I'm gonna I'm gonna talk to him that doesn't
[28:10.840 --> 28:15.960]  wrong the whole big team wants to come out here and talk to me I'm like okay and I'm

[29:03.200 --> 29:07.600]  a war so I've been on the air a couple years but I only had money to finance my own simple
[29:07.600 --> 29:11.480]  little local radio show and I wanted to hire camera people I wanted to make films I wanted
[29:11.480 --> 29:16.760]  to really challenge the globalist and it was a t-shirt I designed the first one mass murderers
[29:16.760 --> 29:22.520]  agreed gun control works that helped us finance hiring the first two members of my crew that's
[29:22.520 --> 29:27.160]  our oldest design and we still sell it we have that design over a hundred others that
[29:27.160 --> 29:31.840]  will now all be limited editions because whatever stuff we've got in that's it we're selling

[34:21.480 --> 34:27.560]  culture wars all over the world that's why the globalists want physical civil war and rioting
[34:27.560 --> 34:32.680]  and death because it's the only way they think they can smoke screen what they've done and not
[34:32.680 --> 34:40.360]  all go to prison so they want violence going into this midterm here's a headline democrat
[34:40.360 --> 34:45.240]  death march to november down all and it just says every poll shows the biggest landslide in us
[34:45.240 --> 34:49.720]  history well trump won the huge landslide and he won the second time in landslide they stole it
[34:50.600 --> 34:55.640]  and they're planning false flags to blame the american people and stir up a race war
[34:55.640 --> 35:01.480]  as i've pointed out you will see mass shootings and subways and in churches and in colleges
[35:01.480 --> 35:06.520]  and in public schools and at shopping malls i've been saying it every day for the last few months
[35:06.520 --> 35:12.360]  that all they got to do is know about schizophrenics that are out there and give them weapons and
[35:12.360 --> 35:19.400]  encourage them and then turn the cameras off as they did in new york yet again and i'm not saying
[35:19.400 --> 35:25.560]  it's staged but we know the fbi was told knew about him and the higher ups didn't let him stop him
[35:27.000 --> 35:31.720]  i'm not blaming everybody at the fbi because there are good people in all these agencies
[35:31.720 --> 35:36.920]  and groups folks but it's it's at the top we've got a serious serious problem but the real enemy
[35:36.920 --> 35:43.000]  is not the justice department it's us we've allowed this to happen our complacency our laziness our
[35:43.000 --> 35:50.360]  compliance with corruption has gotten us here so uh let's continue here live feeds the name of the
[35:50.360 --> 35:56.760]  show today msm scrambling to hide fact that a black supremacist carried out subway terror attack
[35:56.760 --> 36:03.400]  we're about to air a very powerful report that just went to live and it's a brief history of criminal
[36:03.400 --> 36:14.520]  fbi entrapment operations but i wanted to show you a few more of these articles here if you've
[36:14.520 --> 36:19.080]  been hiding under a rock and the most you have at this this ruling happened friday the wittmer
[36:19.080 --> 36:26.760]  fraud should go read it at town hall judge won't force double age to testify kidnap plot it's all
[36:26.760 --> 36:32.600]  coming out fbi domestic terrorism cases have more than doubled since they widely expand the definition
[36:32.600 --> 36:39.800]  of domestic terror threats to any white person committing a crime defended daniel harris acquitted
[36:39.800 --> 36:45.640]  in wittmer trial took the stand and said he thought he was going for beers the night he was arrested
[36:45.640 --> 36:50.440]  and they have the tapes that the fbi themselves made where they're ordering them to attack and
[36:50.440 --> 36:58.040]  ordering them to be part of this too acquitted in wittmer case others in mistrial because it was
[36:58.040 --> 37:04.840]  staged and here's the fact sheet national strategy for countering domestic terrorism that came out
[37:06.680 --> 37:13.000]  the deals with all of this here's biden declares white supremacy greatest threat to america
[37:13.000 --> 37:17.160]  says never forget january 9th capital insurrection january 6th
[37:20.280 --> 37:26.440]  he also came out today and said we have to ban guns and prostitutes
[37:28.920 --> 37:36.440]  and make prostitutes liable with guns in an anti-gun manufacturer speech i mean
[37:36.440 --> 37:42.200]  in an anti-gun manufacturer speech i mean he's gone from embarrassing and a gibbering idiot to
[37:44.920 --> 37:52.760]  a whacked out clown here's the big story a federal jury delivers a rebuke of fbi entrapment
[37:54.040 --> 37:57.400]  it's beyond entrapment they led the organization
[37:59.960 --> 38:02.040]  so let's go ahead and talk about this right now
[38:02.040 --> 38:09.720]  when you look at what happened in wittmer and the attempted kidnapping that was provocateur
[38:09.720 --> 38:13.880]  and false flagged with the justice department that same unit that ran that was then rewarded
[38:13.880 --> 38:19.480]  by being brought to january 6th and we know was in charge of the fbi counterterrorism force of
[38:19.480 --> 38:24.600]  up to a thousand agents that were there at the capital that day so there i'm one person that
[38:24.600 --> 38:28.200]  gets there in the middle of it tries to stop it and got thousands to go away from going into the
[38:28.200 --> 38:35.000]  capital and imagine if the thousand fbi agents and hostage rescue team people had gotten the order
[38:35.800 --> 38:41.640]  to go stop the crowd say hey don't do that come back it would have stopped instead of having
[38:41.640 --> 38:47.240]  a few hundred cops try to stop the 500 to 600 that actually attacked and went in but somebody
[38:47.240 --> 38:58.600]  wanted this to take place to demonize the american people here's greg rica's report
[38:58.600 --> 39:04.840]  last week a jury acquitted two men of all charges in a plot to kidnap michigan governor
[39:04.840 --> 39:10.920]  gretchen wittmer because it was clear that the fbi set the whole thing up while it is
[39:10.920 --> 39:17.080]  surprisingly good news to hear of their acquittal it is not strange to hear of the fbi setting people
[39:17.080 --> 39:25.800]  up they've been doing it for generations during the late 60s fbi informant tommy the traveler
[39:25.800 --> 39:32.600]  traveled to colleges throughout the u.s posing as a student protester he encouraged nonviolent
[39:32.600 --> 39:39.080]  activists to make molotov cocktail explosives out of gasoline and successfully convinced
[39:39.080 --> 39:47.720]  two students at hobart college to fire bomb a campus rotc building joseph burton was hired
[39:47.720 --> 39:54.840]  and funded by the fbi to start a group of Maoist radicals that was deployed to the 1972 republican
[39:54.840 --> 40:02.280]  convention to encourage peaceful demonstrators to topple a bus and blow it up the bomb that killed
[40:02.280 --> 40:08.920]  six people at the world trade center in 1993 was built with the help of fbi informant
[40:08.920 --> 40:16.280]  imad solemn after the bombing the fbi paid solemn over a million dollars to recruit others
[40:16.280 --> 40:25.000]  in a plot to blow up other targets in new york city after the 9 11 attacks the fbi went public
[40:25.000 --> 40:33.640]  with their long secret tradition of entrapment in 2004 fbi informant elder woody was paid 100
[40:33.640 --> 40:40.520]  thousand dollars to gain the trust of shawar saraj become his mentor and turn the conversation
[40:40.520 --> 40:47.160]  towards planning acts of violent terrorism for months before his arrest saraj is on record
[40:47.160 --> 40:57.160]  politely trying to say no in 2006 fbi informant elie asad was paid 85 thousand dollars to bully
[40:57.160 --> 41:04.280]  followers of a cult-like group called the seas of david to swear allegiance to al-qaeda which is
[41:04.280 --> 41:11.960]  all they needed to give five of them long jail sentences in 2008 fbi informants brandon darby
[41:11.960 --> 41:20.840]  and andrew darst brought malatov cocktails to the rnc in 2012 five men in cleveland were directed
[41:20.840 --> 41:29.400]  and groomed by the fbi to discuss the bombing of a bridge in 2015 a week before actual terrorists
[41:29.400 --> 41:36.840]  elton simpson and nadir hamid sufi opened fire on a crowd of people in garland texas an fbi
[41:36.840 --> 41:43.880]  agent commented tear up texas on their social media that same fbi agent was dressed in middle
[41:43.880 --> 41:50.360]  eastern garb and drove behind the perpetrators on their way to the attack the fbi claim that this
[41:50.360 --> 41:57.000]  is a coincidence these are only a few of the instances that we know of there are many more
[41:57.640 --> 42:04.360]  the fbi has a long history of unchecked criminal activity so it is no surprise to hear that the
[42:04.360 --> 42:11.320]  fbi planned the governor whitmer kidnapping that is what they do what is surprising is that the
[42:11.320 --> 42:16.680]  people are starting to wake up and that's good because there are still hundreds of innocent
[42:16.680 --> 42:23.400]  americans rotting away in jail for the so-called insurrection at the us capital on january sixth
[42:23.960 --> 42:31.080]  another obvious false flag executed by the corrupt us department of justice and these
[42:31.080 --> 42:37.800]  same crooked liars are busy trying to lie and deceive us all into a nuclear war with the rest
[42:37.800 --> 42:44.520]  of the world so it is a very good time for the people to start waking up our lives will likely
[42:44.520 --> 42:51.880]  depend on it reporting for info wars this is greg reese that's a very good report uh but i want
[42:51.880 --> 42:56.760]  to add when we come back one little factoid there brampton darby did not do that the left made that
[42:56.760 --> 43:03.000]  up with my love cocktails it was about 25 years ago that i wanted to expand info wars i've been
[43:03.000 --> 43:08.200]  on the air a couple years but i only had money to finance my own simple little local radio show
[43:08.200 --> 43:12.680]  and i wanted to hire camera people i wanted to make films i wanted to really challenge the globalist
[43:12.680 --> 43:18.840]  and it was a t-shirt i designed the first one mass murderers agree gun control works that helped us
[43:18.840 --> 43:23.320]  finance hiring the first two members of my crew that's our oldest design and we're still selling
[43:23.880 --> 43:28.920]  we have that design over a hundred others that will now all be limited editions because whatever
[43:28.920 --> 43:35.160]  stock we've got in that's it we're selling everything out to fund the operation to get rid of inventory
[43:35.160 --> 43:39.000]  we'll still have some teachers in the future they'll just be limited editions and short runs
[43:39.000 --> 43:43.800]  so if you want to get any of these historic shirts this is your last change i almost forgot
[43:43.800 --> 43:50.840]  we're selling them all at cost at infowarstore.com every ball cap every flag every hoodie every

[43:59.960 --> 44:05.080]  whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault
[44:05.080 --> 44:11.480]  on our democracy we will follow the facts wherever they lead domestic terrorists
[44:13.320 --> 44:18.440]  the days of independent media are numbered the government has made it illegal to oppose them
[44:19.000 --> 44:24.440]  they are now deep banking us behind the scenes they want to bankrupt us and make us go away
[44:24.440 --> 44:30.840]  quietly with practically half the population wanting to lock the unvaccinated up in camps
[44:30.840 --> 44:36.840]  the traders know they can shut us down by force but that would accelerate the awakening exponentially
[44:37.400 --> 44:44.920]  so be it make them silence us by force this is the final battle of the information war give now
[44:45.560 --> 44:53.400]  buy products donate before everything changes we need you to carry us through to the end victory
[44:53.400 --> 45:02.840]  for death go now to infowarstore.com there is very little contemporary study in the world

[45:10.360 --> 45:17.000]  anywhere is there a real study of the planet's ruling class and that's done by design the
[45:17.000 --> 45:22.120]  large central banks that basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics
[45:22.120 --> 45:27.880]  that look into say the anglo-american establishment the sound of the builder bird group the trilateral
[45:27.880 --> 45:33.480]  commission of the united nations the whole project of the roth shawls and the rock folks until 10 years
[45:33.480 --> 45:38.920]  ago the media said the control corporate media the builder bird group didn't exist well now the
[45:38.920 --> 45:44.120]  builder bird group is public in its former head still on the steering committee is claus schwaab
[45:44.680 --> 45:49.960]  and he has set up the great reset in global government and if as a liberty movement worldwide
[45:49.960 --> 45:54.760]  we don't address the globalist head on about the second thing or worldwide authoritarian corporate
[45:54.760 --> 45:59.480]  takeover we don't have a shot we do expose them we can beat a measly ladies and gentlemen

[46:29.640 --> 46:34.280]  censorship but because of cost increasing and having to run our own infrastructure and pay for

[47:45.800 --> 47:49.640]  to hit the economic news it's the most important yet the democratic party news and what they're
[47:49.640 --> 47:57.080]  planning uh the pedo grooming and the transgenderism really going to the next level but i want to get
[47:57.080 --> 48:04.680]  to this right now study finds florida handled covid lockdowns better than new york and california
[48:05.480 --> 48:09.320]  and of course the numbers are all there i don't just believe this study they have one of the lowest
[48:09.320 --> 48:13.640]  death rates in the company country and more importantly as governor sanice pointed out
[48:14.280 --> 48:24.200]  it is the democrats and the leaders of these different blue states that were there vacationing
[48:24.760 --> 48:33.400]  and staying in florida we'll play that clip coming up here in just a moment but continuing
[48:33.400 --> 48:38.760]  anti-lockdown florida and south dakota among best pandemic performers pro lockdown new york
[48:38.760 --> 48:45.560]  california among worst major study finds you can go read all about that a working paper
[48:45.560 --> 48:51.720]  published by the national bureau of economic research has scored and ranked us states by the
[48:51.720 --> 48:57.880]  performance over the past two years and three measures health economy and education they found
[48:57.880 --> 49:04.760]  the states that had no lockdown provisions basically did the best really wow how does that
[49:04.760 --> 49:11.160]  work well there's a lot of reasons for it ladies and gentlemen but the power structure knew this
[49:11.160 --> 49:16.600]  was fully aware of nothing to do with viruses and about keeping people safe was about collapsing
[49:16.600 --> 49:23.160]  and consolidating the economy for total control so here's the headline all about politics and
[49:23.160 --> 49:29.320]  control governor to sanice badges democrat covid theater amid renewed mandates and again points out
[49:29.320 --> 49:34.920]  if you had a dollar for all the democrats and globalists on record vacationing in florida
[49:34.920 --> 49:40.760]  port of size basically got 60 percent bigger during because everybody all the globalists
[49:40.760 --> 49:43.480]  went there while they kept everybody else on lockdown here's the governor
[49:47.000 --> 49:54.120]  in the last week or so we've seen major outbreaks of covid-19 among the elite in dc including
[49:54.120 --> 49:58.760]  democrats in congress the biden administration how does it feel to read about that news knowing
[49:58.760 --> 50:03.880]  that the administration has been so critical of your approach to the pandemic so just let me say
[50:03.880 --> 50:10.760]  to very clearly at all floridians you just saw philadelphia impose an indoor mandate you're going
[50:10.760 --> 50:17.000]  to have potentially some of these other deep blue jurisdictions go back to restrictions and mandate
[50:17.000 --> 50:21.720]  you look what's happening in shanghai they have everybody under a brutal lockdown so i just want
[50:21.720 --> 50:30.040]  to be very clear as long as i sit in the chair in which i sit no floridian will be restricted
[50:30.040 --> 50:42.600]  mandated or locked down in any possible way and so when you see some of these folks who want to
[50:42.600 --> 50:48.920]  impose that and let's just be clear you look over the last two years there is a cottage industry
[50:48.920 --> 50:55.400]  that was developed of lockdown politicians and media personalities who would either impose or
[50:55.400 --> 51:01.640]  support lockdown policies in their jurisdictions or advocated on their tv shows criticized
[51:01.640 --> 51:07.240]  floor mercilessly and then the first chance they get to get out from under the yoke of those bad
[51:07.240 --> 51:14.360]  policies you see them in miami or palm beach or all these other places and if i had a dollar
[51:14.360 --> 51:19.800]  for every lockdown politician that escaped their own policies to come to our free state
[51:19.800 --> 51:24.360]  i would be set for life that's just the fact now some people will say oh they're they're
[51:24.360 --> 51:29.480]  hypocrites all this stuff yeah they are but that's not the issue the issue is is if they thought
[51:29.480 --> 51:35.640]  their policies really were necessary and these mitigations really were effective they would
[51:35.640 --> 51:42.840]  be abiding by it they're not abiding by it because they know it's all about politics and control
[51:42.840 --> 51:48.040]  so that's why they don't wear the mask that's why they don't do all this stuff that's right they know
[51:48.760 --> 51:54.760]  it is covered it's covered theater it's power and control designed by the world economic forum
[51:54.760 --> 52:01.320]  bill gates the un in operation lock set by the rockefellers 12 years ago people ask jones how
[52:01.320 --> 52:05.880]  do you predict all this word for word won't be able to go to the ballgame won't be able to go to
[52:05.880 --> 52:13.800]  your job you'll have to wear a mask it's in the plan people so it's about control
[52:15.480 --> 52:23.000]  suicides tripled drug abuse doubled alcoholism tripled i had it wreck members of my family
[52:23.000 --> 52:26.920]  it's been horrible and i was in a state that was only partially locked down
[52:28.440 --> 52:29.960]  abit went along with a bunch of this crap
[52:29.960 --> 52:38.600]  thank god abit's finally delivered the santa said he'd do it but biden actually did it
[52:38.600 --> 52:45.800]  buses are arriving by the hundreds in dc busing the illegals they dump on us to dc
[52:47.480 --> 52:50.360]  i like the santa's is playing the ship in the martin's veneer but whatever
[52:52.600 --> 52:59.880]  it's insane all of this is completely out of control and it just gets crazier from there on
[52:59.880 --> 53:05.880]  out but but the truth is when you're out in the sun viruses die in seconds they die inside in
[53:05.880 --> 53:13.960]  minutes the studies are out there the coronavirus is a very harmless virus in 99% of cases there
[53:13.960 --> 53:18.840]  are some mutations that are bad they quickly become harmless that's how science works how the body
[53:18.840 --> 53:24.440]  works because the virus doesn't want to kill you it wants to replicate and live in you and then spawn
[53:25.640 --> 53:28.600]  but when you get hit with a new one you don't understand or know it can kill you because
[53:28.600 --> 53:33.400]  you never were experienced it but they always mutate where they're harmless that's how nature
[53:33.400 --> 53:41.640]  works it's how god built it until you get something like coronavirus that's been spiked with other
[53:41.640 --> 53:51.320]  cells and with the hiv delivery system then the coding of the virus itself becomes a toxic nano
[53:51.320 --> 53:58.200]  particle very akin to spongiform encephalopathy causing prions and that's why people are saying
[53:58.200 --> 54:03.000]  hey it's in the sewage it's in the water it's a poison well general flint said that a year and a
[54:03.000 --> 54:06.920]  half ago and he said look i can't tell you why it's classified but when he was the head of defense
[54:06.920 --> 54:15.560]  intelligence and the head of national security the the the wuhan laboratory group where my
[54:15.560 --> 54:23.000]  peter dazik came to the military and said we want you to buy this synthetic viral protein
[54:23.000 --> 54:27.480]  that is completely synthetic you can spray out a helicopter spray on people and it's synthetic
[54:27.480 --> 54:31.720]  nanotech made out of hiv delivery system and it keeps replicating and you can't get rid of it
[54:31.720 --> 54:37.400]  because there's no known cure it colonizes you and keeps coming back that's why people usually get
[54:37.400 --> 54:43.080]  the flu never get it for 10 years you get covid you keep getting it all the time and vaccines
[54:43.080 --> 54:47.480]  don't help because they're not vaccines they are permanently infecting us with this crap
[54:48.280 --> 54:53.720]  and that's what the scientists all now agree there are a bunch of chemicals and things that are
[54:53.720 --> 54:57.560]  able to detoxify and we've talked about that and we're going to get more into that in their future
[54:58.760 --> 55:02.840]  but the issue everybody needs to understand is this is not a freaking game
[55:04.840 --> 55:08.040]  and if you don't have vitamin d and if you don't have zinc and if you don't have iodine if you're
[55:08.040 --> 55:13.080]  not getting good sun you are up the creek without a paddle and that stuff will normally make you
[55:13.080 --> 55:20.040]  invincible to viruses with covid class of bio weapon nanotech weapon it only bolsters you and
[55:20.040 --> 55:27.000]  makes you it not be as bad see humans regenerate but not when something cuts our double helix
[55:27.960 --> 55:32.840]  and the spike protein gets enough of a beachhead inside your body and gets into all your organs
[55:32.840 --> 55:37.240]  you're gonna die you're gonna age very quickly look i age massively from it my dad aged from it

[55:51.240 --> 55:55.480]  breathe because i knew that it was psychosomatic the way it operates and i took steroids and

[1:00:43.080 --> 1:00:46.920]  here we are ladies and gentlemen i'm gonna play a few clips here out of your phone calls and news
[1:00:46.920 --> 1:00:53.640]  in the next segment here's dr malone saying everything we had in hospitals to ensure safety
[1:00:53.640 --> 1:00:58.920]  had been suspended and that's the real next level sign worldwide why are all these governments
[1:00:58.920 --> 1:01:03.480]  following the same policy to give people rendezvous that causes kidney failure and doesn't protect you
[1:01:03.480 --> 1:01:09.240]  from the virus but blocking all these other things that are absolutely 100 effective basically
[1:01:09.240 --> 1:01:15.080]  especially when he uses cocktails here he is talking about it speaking out like this is not
[1:01:15.080 --> 1:01:22.680]  an easy thing and um you're always a at least if you think about it uh you're afraid of going too
[1:01:22.680 --> 1:01:31.080]  far and then you got covid again yeah we did that's kind of so that's one of the odd things about
[1:01:31.080 --> 1:01:36.840]  the taking the vaccine after you have natural immunity now we know increases your risk for
[1:01:36.840 --> 1:01:42.120]  adverse events which is one of the reasons why we shouldn't be just willy-nilly vaccinating people
[1:01:42.120 --> 1:01:50.600]  um uh we're not all alike in that way anymore we don't have all the same risks and uh there
[1:01:50.600 --> 1:01:58.040]  this growing awareness that there is t-cell damage uh from the vaccine so that it may be that if
[1:01:58.040 --> 1:02:03.640]  you're naturally immune and you take the vaccine you actually have a less effective immune response
[1:02:03.640 --> 1:02:10.680]  than you did before you took the back um that's still kind of emerging uh but i think there's
[1:02:10.680 --> 1:02:16.120]  a lot of merit that has to be looked at really really rigorously and there's we're in a this
[1:02:16.120 --> 1:02:24.760]  landscape where so much is anecdotal because um the ability to do the work is suppressed it's not
[1:02:24.760 --> 1:02:31.160]  funded you can't publish it and doctors are discouraged to actively discouraged and actively
[1:02:31.160 --> 1:02:39.880]  discouraged to report not just doctors nurses others in the hospital environment um pathologists
[1:02:39.880 --> 1:02:47.960]  are strongly discouraged to perform autopsies all the all the classic stuff that we have had in
[1:02:47.960 --> 1:02:54.280]  our hospital system to ensure a safety and effectiveness and appropriateness of medical
[1:02:54.280 --> 1:03:01.960]  treatment has been suppressed all in this blind rush to um with the logic that anything
[1:03:01.960 --> 1:03:07.880]  which would cause vaccine hesitancy is not allowed must be avoided at all costs yeah
[1:03:07.880 --> 1:03:13.320]  so out of the gates worldwide hundreds of countries under un directive the same policy
[1:03:13.320 --> 1:03:18.040]  to suppress treatments suppress the danger suppress what's really happening and then we
[1:03:18.040 --> 1:03:23.800]  learned it's a globalist weapon of course it is but the good news is here's bill gates wherever he
[1:03:23.800 --> 1:03:27.240]  goes around the world now this just happened yesterday he was going to attend talk being
[1:03:27.240 --> 1:03:40.840]  protested outside with arrest bill gates
[1:03:47.400 --> 1:03:48.840]  arrest bill gates
[1:03:48.840 --> 1:03:57.160]  arrest bill gates arrest bill gates
[1:04:05.640 --> 1:04:09.480]  they're not getting away with this we've saw through them we've had good scientists and
[1:04:09.480 --> 1:04:16.360]  doctors and others come public and we know we warned everybody eight months nine months before
[1:04:16.360 --> 1:04:19.800]  they released the damn shot what it would do because we had all the top scientists i mean
[1:04:19.800 --> 1:04:25.400]  who's who and venerable RNA former chief scientist visor the list just goes on and on the
[1:04:25.400 --> 1:04:34.360]  chief scientist of the EU saying we know what this will do we know what's going to happen
[1:04:35.800 --> 1:04:41.960]  the media is the virus info wars dot com good job of that listeners showing up in the local

[1:06:15.880 --> 1:06:19.320]  another world another time another time
[1:06:19.320 --> 1:06:33.240]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance, live from Austin, Texas,
[1:06:33.240 --> 1:06:50.000]  Broadcasting Worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:55.640]  Our source is God, our source is truth, our source is the sacrifice Christ.
[1:06:55.640 --> 1:07:01.000]  We receive it and we join with our ancestors and our current, rather than those in the
[1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:10.000]  future in eternity, because eternity is not enough.
[1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:17.720]  What is greater than eternity is unlimited eternities, and that is the beginning of the
[1:07:17.720 --> 1:07:19.200]  mind of God.
[1:07:19.200 --> 1:07:29.400]  Well, I want to take your calls from Chris, Michael, Alex, Rush, Brandon, Vern, Dale,
[1:07:29.400 --> 1:07:34.680]  Adam, and others that are patiently holding today.
[1:07:34.680 --> 1:07:38.920]  Now, I did an okay job last hour.
[1:07:38.920 --> 1:07:44.000]  I hit the mentally ill, schizophrenic, black supremacists that went in there reportedly
[1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:49.880]  and shot all these people because they were white, a terrible situation, and it flies
[1:07:49.880 --> 1:07:55.880]  in the face of the FBI report of the last two years that white people are number one
[1:07:55.880 --> 1:07:56.880]  terror threat.
[1:07:56.880 --> 1:07:59.720]  It doesn't mean there aren't crazy white people that go around shooting black folks,
[1:07:59.720 --> 1:08:04.440]  look at Dillon Roof and other cases, but the media is not going to stick the knife in and
[1:08:04.440 --> 1:08:08.800]  turn it and tell white people to hate black people like they would have done if a white
[1:08:08.800 --> 1:08:10.320]  person would have done this.
[1:08:10.320 --> 1:08:14.200]  But we got plenty of crazy white people, plenty of crazy black people, and that's why people
[1:08:14.200 --> 1:08:22.720]  should be armed and trained to protect themselves from people like this individual.
[1:08:22.720 --> 1:08:28.760]  We have, of course, the coming out, the huge ruling by the verdict, by the jury saying
[1:08:28.760 --> 1:08:34.080]  these people are not guilty, they didn't attack, the FBI provocateur them, ordered them to
[1:08:34.080 --> 1:08:37.520]  show up and they were complaining while it was happening that I don't want to kidnap
[1:08:37.520 --> 1:08:41.240]  the governor, get in there and do it and cut her head off.
[1:08:41.240 --> 1:08:49.480]  This isn't just infiltrating, it's not even provocaturing, it's leading attempted terror
[1:08:49.480 --> 1:08:54.360]  attacks to make their minion Whitmer look like a hero and the same FBI that did that
[1:08:54.360 --> 1:08:59.800]  ran at January 6th, provocateur operations that's now coming out.
[1:08:59.800 --> 1:09:04.520]  We've got that, I covered it, and we've got the fact that states that didn't have lockdowns
[1:09:04.520 --> 1:09:10.160]  had the lowest death rates in all those statistics, and then we've got this whole targeting of
[1:09:10.160 --> 1:09:14.280]  the children, new developments there, we're going to be getting to the Democrat death
[1:09:14.280 --> 1:09:16.080]  march to November.
[1:09:16.080 --> 1:09:20.640]  We have narrative fail, only 6% of Americans are buying into Joe Biden's talking point
[1:09:20.640 --> 1:09:27.360]  that Russia is to blame for his record inflation in new polls, the wheels have come off the
[1:09:27.360 --> 1:09:35.120]  establishment, CNN spent $400 million, wasn't $300, $400 million on CNN+, it has less than
[1:09:35.120 --> 1:09:39.520]  10,000 viewers total in a week.
[1:09:39.520 --> 1:09:43.560]  We know that we have listeners tuning in on average listening about 25 minutes.
[1:09:43.560 --> 1:09:49.880]  We know in 25 minutes listening to this show every day, there is conservatively 2 million
[1:09:49.880 --> 1:09:52.800]  people tuned in.
[1:09:52.800 --> 1:09:59.520]  So what's 10,000 divided into 2 million?
[1:09:59.520 --> 1:10:05.120]  I mean we have dozens and dozens and dozens of times the viewership and listeners of CNN
[1:10:05.120 --> 1:10:15.000]  plus every half hour, every 20 minutes, drawing fewer than 10,000 daily users, actually it's
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:19.080]  10,000 weekly, CNBC even spun that.
[1:10:19.080 --> 1:10:29.840]  I mean think of that, you can't force people to watch CNN with Brian Stelter and all these
[1:10:29.840 --> 1:10:36.080]  people like Anderson Cooper are these self-appointed individuals that sit up there and call for
[1:10:36.080 --> 1:10:41.840]  censorship and control of all their competition because they think if we go away they'll be
[1:10:41.840 --> 1:10:43.200]  popular again.
[1:10:43.200 --> 1:10:47.640]  You can ban 100 people, 1,000 people a day, you can take Alex Jones and Joe Rogan off the
[1:10:47.640 --> 1:10:52.320]  air tomorrow, there will be people that fill that vacuum of disagreeing with you and they'll
[1:10:52.320 --> 1:10:56.840]  have millions of viewers instantly.
[1:10:56.840 --> 1:11:04.480]  No one can put CNN and MSNBC and the whole corporate media back together again.
[1:11:04.480 --> 1:11:10.760]  Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall, Humpty Dumpty had a great fall and the greatest example
[1:11:10.760 --> 1:11:14.720]  of that is Brian Stelter who is the living and bottom end of Humpty Dumpty.
[1:11:14.720 --> 1:11:20.120]  So Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall, Humpty Dumpty said we must censor them all, Humpty Dumpty
[1:11:20.120 --> 1:11:28.520]  said only I can speak, Humpty Dumpty was ugly and had disgusting feet, Humpty Dumpty sat
[1:11:28.520 --> 1:11:34.640]  on a wall, Humpty Dumpty had a great fall, all the King's horses and all the King's
[1:11:34.640 --> 1:11:40.160]  men couldn't put Humpty Dumpty back together again.
[1:11:40.160 --> 1:11:42.160]  So what can they do?
[1:11:42.160 --> 1:11:49.560]  They can try to pull us and claw us into the maw, into the hole, into the pit with them
[1:11:49.560 --> 1:11:54.000]  and the answer is we ain't buying your chili.
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:12:01.400]  We're not going along with you, we're not accepting your BS, we break with you and no
[1:12:01.400 --> 1:12:04.720]  we're not going to have the Civil War you want and we're not going to go shoot the cops
[1:12:04.720 --> 1:12:08.560]  like you want and we're not going to attack federal buildings like you want, we're just
[1:12:08.560 --> 1:12:13.400]  going to sit here and culturally withdraw our support from all your systems and speak
[1:12:13.400 --> 1:12:21.920]  out against you and most importantly build our own systems and pray to God to lead God
[1:12:21.920 --> 1:12:24.280]  and direct us.
[1:12:24.280 --> 1:12:29.560]  So they can sit around in their chairs and have the Atlantic monthly owned by Steve Jobs'
[1:12:29.560 --> 1:12:33.600]  wife who was one of the most frequent visitors at Epstein Island and they can sit up there
[1:12:33.600 --> 1:12:39.600]  and pontificate about how only they're real and everybody else is fake but at the end
[1:12:39.600 --> 1:12:45.400]  of the day everybody knows.
[1:12:45.400 --> 1:12:56.760]  Everybody knows who they are and what they are and where they're going.
[1:12:56.760 --> 1:13:02.480]  You know we always turn him into it the clown but it the clown's almost more lovable than
[1:13:02.480 --> 1:13:03.480]  Brian Stelter.
[1:13:03.480 --> 1:13:11.400]  It's not even fair to make him turn into the clown on TV, it's better just to show his
[1:13:11.400 --> 1:13:12.400]  real face.
[1:13:12.400 --> 1:13:13.400]  Yeah, yeah.
[1:13:13.400 --> 1:13:14.400]  Please don't turn back at the clown.
[1:13:14.400 --> 1:13:19.600]  That's scarier looking than it because that's real.
[1:13:19.600 --> 1:13:22.560]  Why would the, why would time warn?
[1:13:22.560 --> 1:13:29.240]  Why would AT&T want to put that on TV because they want to force ugliness and evil and fraud
[1:13:29.240 --> 1:13:34.280]  and lies on you because they're hunchbacked and they're ugly spiritually and they like
[1:13:34.280 --> 1:13:41.200]  the fact that they're forcing their ugliness on us, their spiritual ugliness, their filth
[1:13:41.200 --> 1:13:42.360]  on us.
[1:13:42.360 --> 1:13:44.560]  I'm going to stop ranting.
[1:13:44.560 --> 1:13:50.880]  I'm going to go to your calls and then I need to get into the censorship news.
[1:13:50.880 --> 1:13:57.160]  I need to get into this, this, this, this, this pedo news but let's hit this right now
[1:13:57.160 --> 1:13:58.160]  briefly.
[1:13:58.160 --> 1:14:08.640]  Joe Biden came out, as you know, yesterday, the video was on infowars.com and he said,
[1:14:08.640 --> 1:14:12.760]  well, you got to hear this for yourself.
[1:14:12.760 --> 1:14:19.640]  He said that they've got to legalize blaming gun manufacturers for shootings.
[1:14:19.640 --> 1:14:23.280]  Well, next, you're going to blame somebody that uses a baseball bat to kill somebody
[1:14:23.280 --> 1:14:30.640]  or a butcher knife or a car but notice the same law firm, Rem of the Democrats, is trying
[1:14:30.640 --> 1:14:35.920]  to sue me out of business, is the same one that got the Remington situation and they're
[1:14:35.920 --> 1:14:39.960]  now the ones filing lawsuits against gun manufacturers everywhere to shut them down.
[1:14:39.960 --> 1:14:44.360]  Just like if they're able to try to shut us down with their fake lawsuits, they believe
[1:14:44.360 --> 1:14:48.840]  they can then shut down all the other patriots and resistance out there with picked, kept
[1:14:48.840 --> 1:14:54.440]  juries and pet judges and that's their stratagem and that is their overall plan.
[1:14:54.440 --> 1:15:01.360]  But here's Biden can't even get it right when he's saying we need to go out for gun manufacturers
[1:15:01.360 --> 1:15:05.000]  and then he butchers it and brings in prostitutes somehow.
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:06.000]  Here it is.
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:09.160]  I said, what do you think the deer you're hunting or where Kevlar vests?
[1:15:09.160 --> 1:15:11.440]  What the hell you need 20 bullets for?
[1:15:11.440 --> 1:15:14.200]  You must be a hell of a terrible shot.
[1:15:14.200 --> 1:15:15.200]  I'm serious.
[1:15:15.200 --> 1:15:16.500]  Think about it.
[1:15:16.500 --> 1:15:24.680]  Think about the mass shootings, as many as a hundred rounds, it's a weapon of war.
[1:15:24.680 --> 1:15:29.920]  There's nothing to do with recreation.
[1:15:29.920 --> 1:15:36.360]  I'll ride bad in the sale and possession of unsurrealized guns.
[1:15:36.360 --> 1:15:40.920]  Eliminate gun manufacturers immunity from liability, they're the only outfit, they're
[1:15:40.920 --> 1:15:45.920]  the only outfit in the country that is immune.
[1:15:45.920 --> 1:15:51.520]  Even had the tobacco industry been immune to prostitutes being sued.
[1:15:51.520 --> 1:15:52.520]  Come on.
[1:15:52.520 --> 1:15:53.520]  Yep.
[1:15:53.520 --> 1:15:59.080]  The gun manufacturers and the tobacco companies are immune to prostitutes.
[1:15:59.080 --> 1:16:06.160]  Over the years, Info Wars has produced more than 200 amazing patriot Americana, Second
[1:16:06.160 --> 1:16:11.480]  Amendment pro-liberty themed t-shirts, ball caps, flags, you name it.
[1:16:11.480 --> 1:16:15.320]  All of the apparel and the flags are being sold at cost right now.
[1:16:15.320 --> 1:16:18.000]  This is regular plain chain shirts.
[1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:23.480]  That is all sorts of designer shirts that cost us $15, $20, $25 to produce.
[1:16:23.480 --> 1:16:27.440]  We used to sell for $40, we're selling them for $15, selling them for $20, whatever the
[1:16:27.440 --> 1:16:28.440]  shirt costs us.
[1:16:28.440 --> 1:16:32.600]  If a shirt costs $5, we're selling it for $5 for us to actually produce.
[1:16:32.600 --> 1:16:36.760]  It costs $10, we're selling it for $10, and we've got hoodies, and we've got long sleeves,
[1:16:36.760 --> 1:16:40.560]  and we've got short sleeves, we've got them all, and we've got to liquidate them all,
[1:16:40.560 --> 1:16:45.680]  and they're limited edition, because we're never going to make any of these designs again.
[1:16:45.680 --> 1:16:49.840]  We are going to come out with some new designs that will be limited, limited edition in the
[1:16:49.840 --> 1:16:50.840]  future.
[1:16:50.840 --> 1:16:55.600]  We've got to sell this to keep Info Wars on the air, plus it spreads the word, infowarstore.com,
[1:16:55.600 --> 1:16:58.960]  your historic apparel now, infowarstore.com.
[1:16:58.960 --> 1:17:00.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, I need your help.
[1:17:00.720 --> 1:17:04.160]  I need your help keeping Info Wars on the air and strong.
[1:17:04.160 --> 1:17:08.160]  I need your help making sure that our mission continues on.
[1:17:08.160 --> 1:17:12.800]  I was born for this, you were born for this, and people are really waking up right now,
[1:17:12.800 --> 1:17:17.800]  but we had to build our own infrastructure because of the censorship and de-platforming
[1:17:17.800 --> 1:17:19.520]  that cost tens of millions of dollars.
[1:17:19.520 --> 1:17:24.200]  And now, with Band-Aught Video getting close to 10 million views a day, we're a platform
[1:17:24.200 --> 1:17:30.120]  for thousands of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content free
[1:17:30.120 --> 1:17:31.120]  of charge.
[1:17:31.120 --> 1:17:35.880]  And because it's become so successful, it's a catch-22.
[1:17:35.880 --> 1:17:40.400]  Info Wars and Band-Aught Video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human liberty
[1:17:40.400 --> 1:17:46.720]  movement worldwide, but the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter, hundreds
[1:17:46.720 --> 1:17:48.520]  and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month.
[1:17:48.520 --> 1:17:52.800]  So the biggest sale in Info Wars history is going right now, the mega-emergency blowout
[1:17:52.800 --> 1:17:58.240]  sale up to 75% off, getting credible products and keeping Info Wars as strong as ever.
[1:17:58.240 --> 1:18:02.720]  You know, it's a fact, and I'm not bragging when I say it, it's just true, that Info
[1:18:02.720 --> 1:18:10.840]  Wars is seen by the globalist as the standard of human liberty, as the logo of human populist
[1:18:10.840 --> 1:18:15.560]  resistance against their transhumanist anti-human program.
[1:18:15.560 --> 1:18:22.360]  And man, our work is really right now hitting the most important aspects of what we've ever
[1:18:22.360 --> 1:18:23.360]  done.
[1:18:23.360 --> 1:18:28.240]  So I'm asking listeners now to realize we've got great products, thousands of them, at

[1:19:59.480 --> 1:20:25.480]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:25.480 --> 1:20:36.480]  It's beautiful, Alex's deep, no melody settles down over me, I'm not bored or unhappy, I'm
[1:20:36.480 --> 1:20:39.480]  still so strange and wild.
[1:20:39.480 --> 1:20:48.480]  I'm in the wind, I'm in the water, nobody's sun, nobody's dark, I'm watching the chemtrails
[1:20:48.480 --> 1:21:00.480]  over the country cloud, seven beyond the red-eyed mark in what to do next, maybe we're loving
[1:21:00.480 --> 1:21:08.480]  white-picking candle-shares over the country cloud.
[1:21:08.480 --> 1:21:24.960]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back and we're about to go straight to your phone
[1:21:24.960 --> 1:21:25.960]  calls.
[1:21:25.960 --> 1:21:27.960]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[1:21:27.960 --> 1:21:32.880]  A lot of news I'm going to hit, but let's just get to your calls right now, look really
[1:21:32.880 --> 1:21:35.800]  forward to talking to you.
[1:21:35.800 --> 1:21:42.680]  Let's go ahead and talk to Adam in New Jersey, Adam, thank you for calling, you're on the
[1:21:42.680 --> 1:21:43.680]  air.
[1:21:43.680 --> 1:21:46.640]  Alex, it's a pleasure to be talking to you, man, I just want to let you know you are the
[1:21:46.640 --> 1:21:49.160]  tip of the spear, thank you for everything that you do.
[1:21:49.160 --> 1:21:53.360]  I want to take up a little bit of your time, man, I live in Jersey and I just feel like
[1:21:53.360 --> 1:21:57.680]  this whole thing going on in Brooklyn, it just seems all too convenient, we've seen this
[1:21:57.680 --> 1:22:02.080]  move by the globalists before, they overplay their hand and then they go quickly to the
[1:22:02.080 --> 1:22:03.080]  other side.
[1:22:03.080 --> 1:22:07.000]  It's not adding up over here, I just wanted to get your thoughts on that.
[1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:12.520]  Well, give us your view on it because conveniently the camera failed, they set up thousands of
[1:22:12.520 --> 1:22:16.120]  cameras, that's the one area where they failed.
[1:22:16.120 --> 1:22:20.280]  That's exactly what I'm saying, it seems too coincidental and they just happen to find
[1:22:20.280 --> 1:22:21.280]  all the cards.
[1:22:21.280 --> 1:22:24.600]  Well, you're not supposed to ask questions, sir, just go back to sleep, come on.
[1:22:24.600 --> 1:22:30.680]  Yeah, that's my problem here, I'm awake and they find the U-Haul there and they have all
[1:22:30.680 --> 1:22:34.880]  these videos of his social media, if he was some mastermind, why does he have all these
[1:22:34.880 --> 1:22:38.240]  videos basically saying he's crazy out there?
[1:22:38.240 --> 1:22:42.000]  And now it's suddenly this guy, it doesn't make sense to me, Alex.
[1:22:42.000 --> 1:22:45.520]  Well they got rid of the mental institutions in the 80s and there are a lot of crazy people
[1:22:45.520 --> 1:22:49.360]  and the FBI did try to go after him but higher-ups blocked it, so they didn't fit the narrative,
[1:22:49.360 --> 1:22:52.920]  he had been a white crazy that had gone after him because that fits the narrative, I mean
[1:22:52.920 --> 1:22:57.320]  I don't know if it was a staged event, I don't know if it was provocative, but we'll continue
[1:22:57.320 --> 1:22:58.320]  to watch it as it develops.
[1:22:58.320 --> 1:22:59.320]  What else is on your mind, brother?
[1:22:59.320 --> 1:23:00.320]  You want to talk about Russia?
[1:23:00.320 --> 1:23:06.280]  Oh, Russia's crazy right now, it's the other thing too, first Zelensky, he needs our help
[1:23:06.280 --> 1:23:11.520]  and now he's saying that we're cowards for not helping, he wasn't in NATO and with everything
[1:23:11.520 --> 1:23:15.560]  going on, Ukraine's filled with Nazis and no one wants to report on that.
[1:23:15.560 --> 1:23:22.000]  Well, I love to accept the Russians pull out from around Kiev, then Zelensky and Boris
[1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:27.400]  Johnson march around like they're in a combat zone with no craters, no dead people, no snipers
[1:23:27.400 --> 1:23:33.120]  in a city that Putin says he's not going to attack, I mean it's just, it's preposterous.
[1:23:33.120 --> 1:23:37.400]  It's absolutely crazy and they're making all this up saying there's a ton of attempts
[1:23:37.400 --> 1:23:41.600]  on his life, this is the Russians are dealing with, they're a competent military, they're
[1:23:41.600 --> 1:23:44.440]  making it all up, if they wanted in bed they'd have taken him out, but that's not the way
[1:23:44.440 --> 1:23:45.440]  Putin works.
[1:23:45.440 --> 1:23:52.880]  Well, I don't want to over-lionize the Russian military, it's the US military is in constant
[1:23:52.880 --> 1:23:57.080]  war, that's why it's one of the best, if not the best in the world, the Russians have
[1:23:57.080 --> 1:24:00.760]  not been in a bunch of wars in a while, well Russians fight absolutely, but I mean you've
[1:24:00.760 --> 1:24:05.760]  got Russians fighting Russians basically in Ukraine and it's a bloodbath, you've had
[1:24:05.760 --> 1:24:10.680]  the US military and special forces there for over a decade preparing to lure the Russians
[1:24:10.680 --> 1:24:16.600]  in, it's been declassified and Russia walked right into a high-tech trap, thanks for the
[1:24:16.600 --> 1:24:18.560]  call.
[1:24:18.560 --> 1:24:26.160]  Currently Putin is getting smashed and I said Putin went into a trap when it first happened,
[1:24:26.160 --> 1:24:30.680]  this will make Afghanistan look like a cakewalk, that means Soros and the Globalists are to
[1:24:30.680 --> 1:24:34.400]  blame for starting this, but it doesn't mean I'm going to go, oh look Putin's doing a great
[1:24:34.400 --> 1:24:39.720]  job, oh you're so smart to go in there, no Putin's finding out, I mean look Putin's not
[1:24:39.720 --> 1:24:45.600]  done, I'll give you that, what did he think was waiting for him when he went into there?
[1:24:45.600 --> 1:24:47.800]  What do you think?
[1:24:47.800 --> 1:24:53.120]  All the special forces units of Europe and the Delta Force and the rest of them for a
[1:24:53.120 --> 1:25:00.080]  decade training the Ukrainians with high-tech weapons were to take some mile away or two
[1:25:00.080 --> 1:25:06.160]  miles away and use aim, fire, it hits the target.
[1:25:06.160 --> 1:25:10.400]  And Putin did know that, he knew that NATO was moving in about to overthrow Ukraine and
[1:25:10.400 --> 1:25:13.920]  they already overthrown an electric regime and he made the decision to go in, so he just
[1:25:13.920 --> 1:25:20.400]  said screw it, I'm going to fight and the Russians are getting annihilated because they've
[1:25:20.400 --> 1:25:27.160]  got high-tech ballistic missiles and high-tech long-range systems, but they just do not have
[1:25:27.160 --> 1:25:33.520]  switchblade drones like the US has, they've dumped over 100,000 switchblade drones in
[1:25:33.520 --> 1:25:39.400]  that a one man can have two on his back, launch it with a target and take out vehicles and
[1:25:39.400 --> 1:25:46.280]  armored vehicles, you name it, it's a small cruise missile, I mean the US is 30 years ahead
[1:25:46.280 --> 1:25:52.040]  of Russia, Russia might as well be fighting space aliens right now.
[1:25:52.040 --> 1:26:01.640]  And so that's what's happening, you've got a 1980s army that is rolling in against basically
[1:26:01.640 --> 1:26:07.480]  Martian technology, I mean I would describe it like that, I mean all the Russians could
[1:26:07.480 --> 1:26:11.760]  do if they wanted to win this now was just nuke the major cities and then he'd be a war
[1:26:11.760 --> 1:26:18.920]  criminal but now the Ukrainians are motivated, they're dug in, they've got high-tech weapons
[1:26:18.920 --> 1:26:23.320]  and unless the Russians flatten every city they're not going to be able to take the country
[1:26:23.320 --> 1:26:29.040]  which Putin claims he's not doing, but he can't even win the east part right now because
[1:26:29.040 --> 1:26:34.160]  the United States and people that run our country have been there for a decade training
[1:26:34.160 --> 1:26:39.520]  serious commando units for this, and they all speak the same language, they look the
[1:26:39.520 --> 1:26:46.400]  same so the groups can infiltrate back and forth across sides, the ultimate proxy war,
[1:26:46.400 --> 1:26:58.600]  it'd be like having Arkansas and Oklahoma go to war with Texas and Texas is Russia,
[1:26:58.600 --> 1:27:03.200]  it's bigger more people but Oklahoma and Arkansas they basically talk the same, look
[1:27:03.200 --> 1:27:06.480]  the same, they're not wimps, well what's going to happen, I'm going to kill each other, it's
[1:27:06.480 --> 1:27:12.040]  not going to stop, I mean imagine if Texas went to war against Oklahoma and Arkansas
[1:27:12.040 --> 1:27:16.240]  how would that go, you're like well there's more Texans than them, yeah but it doesn't
[1:27:16.240 --> 1:27:24.480]  matter it's going to be a bloodbath and you can't tell who's who, that's why in the old
[1:27:24.480 --> 1:27:28.440]  days people wear military uniforms because at least it's showers you know who you're

[1:29:03.240 --> 1:29:08.280]  of years but I only had money to finance my own simple little local radio show and I wanted
[1:29:08.280 --> 1:29:12.440]  to hire camera people, I wanted to make films, I wanted to really challenge the globalist
[1:29:12.440 --> 1:29:17.680]  and it was a t-shirt I designed, the first one, Mass Murderers Agreed Gun Control Works
[1:29:17.680 --> 1:29:22.160]  that helped us finance hiring the first two members of my crew, that's our oldest design
[1:29:22.160 --> 1:29:26.800]  and we're still selling, we have that design over a hundred others that will now all be

[1:33:29.760 --> 1:33:36.680]  We're about to go to Brandon in Texas, let's talk about supply chain breakdowns and shortages
[1:33:36.680 --> 1:33:38.520]  in baby formula.
[1:33:38.520 --> 1:33:44.040]  I personally this weekend went to three grocery stores to see for myself and these are grocery
[1:33:44.040 --> 1:33:49.120]  stores that are never sparse and they were half empty or more and Texas is one of the
[1:33:49.120 --> 1:33:55.160]  most food independent states in the United States, in a country that is the most food
[1:33:55.160 --> 1:34:03.520]  independent in the world, so I'm in the best state or if not the second best state in America
[1:34:03.520 --> 1:34:09.280]  that's the best country in the world and I saw for myself there was no baby formula,
[1:34:09.280 --> 1:34:12.720]  not that I have a baby anymore but I went and looked, I don't just believe the news,
[1:34:12.720 --> 1:34:17.840]  I want to eyeball this, hell I got footage on my iPhone of it and there it was, here's
[1:34:17.840 --> 1:34:22.600]  some of the headlines, narrative fail, only 6% of Americans are buying Joe Biden's talking
[1:34:22.600 --> 1:34:28.840]  point that Russia is the blame for the record inflation, UK households incomes obliterated
[1:34:28.840 --> 1:34:34.680]  by inflation storm as living standards plunge, Biden economy average American lost 2.7% in
[1:34:34.680 --> 1:34:41.400]  earning power in March alone due to the massive inflation, it just goes on and on, I got a
[1:34:41.400 --> 1:34:49.640]  giant stack here, Russia's lower house voices opposition proposals to suspending gas supplies
[1:34:49.640 --> 1:34:57.880]  to Europe, Russia's lower house voices proposals on suspending gas supplies to EU countries,
[1:34:57.880 --> 1:35:04.280]  food shortages loom as Chinese farmers face trouble amid pandemic, it's all over the world,
[1:35:04.280 --> 1:35:10.800]  it goes on and on but right now let's go back to your calls, let's talk to Brandon in Texas,
[1:35:10.800 --> 1:35:12.200]  Brandon thanks for calling.
[1:35:12.200 --> 1:35:18.840]  Hey, good afternoon Alex, I just wanted to call and kind of bring that up, the situation
[1:35:18.840 --> 1:35:26.280]  with the baby formula, mostly in regards to now most retailers are actually limiting
[1:35:26.280 --> 1:35:31.040]  the amount that consumers can actually buy and I kind of want to give you thoughts on
[1:35:31.040 --> 1:35:38.120]  that and one of the kind of off topic subject is with the food production here in the United
[1:35:38.120 --> 1:35:42.760]  States with the Chinese coming over here and buying up all the farmland involved with
[1:35:42.760 --> 1:35:49.000]  Bill Gates, kind of what do you expect moving forward for a free supply chain?
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:54.920]  Well I said it years ago, when they globally devalue the currency and when they get the
[1:35:54.920 --> 1:36:00.200]  general public not to work anymore with universal basic income, land and agriculture are going
[1:36:00.200 --> 1:36:06.160]  to be one of the most valuable things after raw minerals, rare earth minerals like lithium
[1:36:06.160 --> 1:36:10.040]  and other things so yeah, the globalists are going to race with all their fiat money to
[1:36:10.040 --> 1:36:15.720]  buy up all the infrastructure, all the land, all the production facilities they can because
[1:36:15.720 --> 1:36:17.520]  that in the future is going to be everything.
[1:36:17.520 --> 1:36:20.960]  Every one in the future is going to want to live in the country, every one in the future
[1:36:20.960 --> 1:36:28.160]  is not going to want to live in a giant third world slave grid, high tech death grid city.
[1:36:28.160 --> 1:36:35.040]  Yeah and in particular, I mean looking what's happening over in Shanghai, one of China's
[1:36:35.040 --> 1:36:39.200]  most popular cities with the amount of food shortage that's going on over there.
[1:36:39.200 --> 1:36:42.960]  And all of it, again they're getting China ready for the worldwide collapse, they're
[1:36:42.960 --> 1:36:47.440]  already doing their drills on how to lock down one of their biggest cities because they
[1:36:47.440 --> 1:36:52.080]  know this is part of an economic warfare plan and China wants to be ready.
[1:36:52.080 --> 1:36:57.400]  Exactly, killing all the dogs, killing all the cats, who would believe that before?
[1:36:57.400 --> 1:36:59.400]  But this is what they're doing.
[1:36:59.400 --> 1:37:04.360]  Well Alex I just want to take a little bit of your time today, I appreciate you taking
[1:37:04.360 --> 1:37:07.280]  my call and you know, Alex Jones is right.
[1:37:07.280 --> 1:37:10.640]  Well I wish I wasn't right brother, thank you so much Brandon, love you.
[1:37:10.640 --> 1:37:15.920]  Alright, up next here let's go to Michael in Nebraska.
[1:37:15.920 --> 1:37:19.840]  Michael you're on the air, I want to talk about your father had the Pfizer shot and
[1:37:19.840 --> 1:37:20.840]  what happened?
[1:37:20.840 --> 1:37:24.360]  Hey Alex, it's actually Michelle.
[1:37:24.360 --> 1:37:27.160]  I'm sorry, the distance I read it wrong, I apologize Michelle.
[1:37:27.160 --> 1:37:29.600]  It's okay, no worries.
[1:37:29.600 --> 1:37:33.800]  I appreciate you very much and your willingness and dedication.
[1:37:33.800 --> 1:37:42.000]  Honestly, I was pregnant when I started listening to you and chose not to get the vaccination
[1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:48.240]  after educating myself, unfortunately and my baby and I are helping my other kids are
[1:37:48.240 --> 1:37:57.600]  helping but my father, I'm his power of attorney and two years ago he was riding his bike nine
[1:37:57.600 --> 1:37:58.600]  miles a day.
[1:37:58.600 --> 1:37:59.600]  Wow.
[1:37:59.600 --> 1:38:09.520]  He was very in shape, elderly yes but very in shape and exercise every day and now he
[1:38:09.520 --> 1:38:14.160]  can barely walk to his mailbox without getting out of breath.
[1:38:14.160 --> 1:38:22.280]  So I took him to the VA, he's a former vet and I wanted some blood work done and because
[1:38:22.280 --> 1:38:32.040]  he's had three shots and the doctor acted like I was crazy because I explained why I wanted
[1:38:32.040 --> 1:38:37.520]  this blood work done and I had previously before we went I told my dad what I was concerned
[1:38:37.520 --> 1:38:48.240]  about which is vaccine induced autoimmune deficiency syndrome and the doctor literally
[1:38:48.240 --> 1:38:49.960]  acted like I was crazy.
[1:38:49.960 --> 1:38:54.040]  Yeah they gaslight you even though it's in all their literature and they know it's real
[1:38:54.040 --> 1:38:56.040]  they gaslight you.
[1:38:56.040 --> 1:39:03.040]  He acted like it was the first time he was hearing this information and he is one of
[1:39:03.040 --> 1:39:11.520]  the main doctors at the VA and so I educated him on what I knew and he refused to do an
[1:39:11.520 --> 1:39:21.040]  HIV test so we said what are the other options and by the way you can show people piles of
[1:39:21.040 --> 1:39:24.600]  mainstream news that a lot of people that have had these shots come up positive for
[1:39:24.600 --> 1:39:26.520]  HIV and that's the big secret.
[1:39:26.520 --> 1:39:28.520]  I mean this is so incredible.
[1:39:28.520 --> 1:39:38.040]  Seeing that his symptoms were in my opinion directly caused by something that was injected
[1:39:38.040 --> 1:39:39.040]  into him.
[1:39:39.040 --> 1:39:44.880]  So after arguing about this test he said he would order a lymphocyte test.
[1:39:44.880 --> 1:39:50.240]  I followed up a week later and he said he'd ordered it.
[1:39:50.240 --> 1:39:55.920]  The director of nursing told me he didn't order it so I said you tell him it was a Friday
[1:39:55.920 --> 1:40:00.680]  afternoon I said you tell him to call me back before five o'clock today before he leaves
[1:40:00.680 --> 1:40:05.520]  that building because I want to know why he didn't order that test I told him to order
[1:40:05.520 --> 1:40:12.120]  and once my son said there was some issues he reordered the test I had to take my dad
[1:40:12.120 --> 1:40:18.640]  back there to get another blood draw because the time had lapsed and so I got the results
[1:40:18.640 --> 1:40:27.280]  back last week and before I called today I prayed to God that there will be done God
[1:40:27.280 --> 1:40:30.520]  because I honestly didn't think I would get through to you.
[1:40:30.520 --> 1:40:34.200]  I'm a first time caller and I did get through.
[1:40:34.200 --> 1:40:36.680]  You were meant to be on here and we'll put you on hold two later if you want to show
[1:40:36.680 --> 1:40:41.720]  us the results we'll black out his name but so you finally got the you finally got the
[1:40:41.720 --> 1:40:45.200]  test back Michelle what did you find out?
[1:40:45.200 --> 1:40:54.920]  So I was saying that total T cells that's a low end.
[1:40:54.920 --> 1:41:02.520]  The CD4 which is the T4 helper cells that is actually had an earring that was low.
[1:41:02.520 --> 1:41:06.160]  I want to hear this but your phone's breaking up so back away from it or get right on it
[1:41:06.160 --> 1:41:07.160]  again.
[1:41:07.160 --> 1:41:08.160]  Can you hear me?
[1:41:08.160 --> 1:41:09.160]  I'm not moving.
[1:41:09.160 --> 1:41:17.280]  I can hear you better now start over with what's in the report.
[1:41:17.280 --> 1:41:26.240]  In the report the T cells I wanted to know his T cells and they're low the B cells B is
[1:41:26.240 --> 1:41:37.440]  in boy those are also low the CD8 cells those are your absolute suppressor cells low and
[1:41:37.440 --> 1:41:49.680]  then the T4 T8 ratio high and it's very high so I looked up what does T4 T8 ratio high
[1:41:49.680 --> 1:42:00.280]  mean and I got instantly on WebMD pubskins lymphoma so I want you and your listeners
[1:42:00.280 --> 1:42:09.400]  to know as much hearsay as people are saying that it's not affecting your T cells I have
[1:42:09.400 --> 1:42:17.200]  proof that it is and I feel horrible that I let him get this it was out of my control
[1:42:17.200 --> 1:42:18.200]  to be honest.
[1:42:18.200 --> 1:42:23.520]  Don't feel bad that's what the German scientists have said is that they found massive increases
[1:42:23.520 --> 1:42:30.760]  in lymphoma and people that already had cancer that were under cancer treatment being observed
[1:42:30.760 --> 1:42:35.720]  a big study in Germany that took these Pfizer maternal shots it just grew cancers at levels
[1:42:35.720 --> 1:42:36.720]  never foreseeing.
[1:42:36.720 --> 1:42:41.560]  We're talking about cancers doubling in a week that would take up six months to double.
[1:42:41.560 --> 1:42:45.760]  We're talking just explosive cancer growth God bless your father I'm so sorry they did
[1:42:45.760 --> 1:42:50.400]  that but yeah they want to exterminate everybody this is a depopulation operation they want
[1:42:50.400 --> 1:42:54.560]  to set the president to do it this is mass culling I bless you thank you for the call
[1:42:54.560 --> 1:42:59.080]  Michelle.

[1:43:12.840 --> 1:43:18.640]  have broken down and Mfoldwarstore is having serious trouble making its payroll and paying
[1:43:18.640 --> 1:43:23.680]  for operations and I do not want to implode or downsize in the face of the globalist making
[1:43:23.680 --> 1:43:24.680]  their main move.

[1:43:29.480 --> 1:43:34.200]  despite the censorship but because of cost increasing and having to run our own infrastructure

[1:43:58.600 --> 1:44:00.100]  Mike in California thanks for calling.
[1:44:00.100 --> 1:44:05.000]  I think we're barking up the wrong tree calling this gain of function research now if you read
[1:44:05.000 --> 1:44:10.680]  the actual you know 2014 legislation the U.S. government gain of function deliberative process
[1:44:10.680 --> 1:44:16.120]  and research funding pause on selected gain of function research involving influenza MERS
[1:44:16.120 --> 1:44:21.320]  and Zars virus there's nothing about Zars like viruses and it's a research funding pause
[1:44:21.320 --> 1:44:25.520]  it's not a stop it's not a prohibition it's when you come to a four-way intersection
[1:44:25.520 --> 1:44:29.680]  there's the stop sign you stop you look both ways and then you proceed and so it's also
[1:44:29.680 --> 1:44:34.240]  it doesn't pause all gain of function just selected gain of function but they'll argue
[1:44:34.240 --> 1:44:39.080]  that this is actually characterization and qualification research though you know Rand
[1:44:39.080 --> 1:44:42.240]  and others you know maybe Fauci was right they don't quite know what they're talking
[1:44:42.240 --> 1:44:45.640]  about calling it gain of function you know that's why he didn't perjure himself that's
[1:44:45.640 --> 1:44:49.600]  why he hasn't been arrested because they're literally creating new synthetic life forms
[1:44:49.600 --> 1:44:54.240]  that mimic what the viruses do but in the main definition it's still a gain of function
[1:44:54.240 --> 1:44:57.640]  you're making something deadly that spreads more easily to hurt people thank you Mike
[1:44:57.640 --> 1:45:02.640]  we love you experience the next level in high-powered energy new tropics with our latest

[1:46:55.000 --> 1:47:04.320]  info wars store dot com leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order
[1:47:04.320 --> 1:47:30.800]  it's alex jones you know during the break i was just rereading the the ratings for singing
[1:47:30.800 --> 1:47:36.920]  and plus four hundred million dollars plus an investment and it has less than ten thousand
[1:47:36.920 --> 1:47:43.320]  viewers a week that's almost impossible you can't make people watch it at gunpoint but
[1:47:43.320 --> 1:47:49.280]  imagine the arrogance of them looking at our successful system or or or fox nation or joe
[1:47:49.280 --> 1:47:56.200]  rogan where people will come online and watch something they will support it and they thought
[1:47:56.200 --> 1:48:01.880]  well we'll just go do what they've done will be successful no you're the most uncool biggest
[1:48:01.880 --> 1:48:08.720]  lying failures anywhere you are beyond rejection you can't even get ten thousand of your drooling
[1:48:08.720 --> 1:48:14.760]  minion viewers on mainline cnn that itself is is a total black hole less than a hundred
[1:48:14.760 --> 1:48:20.360]  thousand viewers per hour you can't get him to go to your online platform because your
[1:48:20.360 --> 1:48:25.360]  zombie listeners probably don't even know how to do it think about what that says about
[1:48:25.360 --> 1:48:34.200]  the self-appointed officious sanctimonious arrogant losers you can laugh at them all day they
[1:48:34.200 --> 1:48:38.040]  still got the power structure behind them but what does it say about the power structure
[1:48:38.040 --> 1:48:43.560]  on average like eighty five years old that really believes cnn's getting us or their
[1:48:43.560 --> 1:48:49.200]  lawsuits against us so their lives are gonna silence us you can take alex jones and joe
[1:48:49.200 --> 1:48:55.040]  rogan and tucker carlson off the air tomorrow and you would just create more resistance
[1:48:55.040 --> 1:48:59.400]  the question is though how do they stop us with wars with famine and collapse so you
[1:48:59.400 --> 1:49:02.800]  think they're just gonna go away because everybody turned against them and their pedophilia
[1:49:02.800 --> 1:49:09.240]  and their transgenderism and their devaluation of currencies and their devil worship no
[1:49:09.240 --> 1:49:14.480]  they are going to implode everything and starve us to death so they can still run our lives
[1:49:14.480 --> 1:49:18.960]  but if we identify them and say no to them and stand up to them and through the states
[1:49:18.960 --> 1:49:23.560]  and the legislatures and the cities humanity will want to be successful and want to survive
[1:49:23.560 --> 1:49:27.760]  and we will fully reject these people and get them off our backs because in the old
[1:49:27.760 --> 1:49:31.920]  days an authoritarian state had to have support really to win now they're an authoritarian
[1:49:31.920 --> 1:49:36.960]  state but they're a shadow state a deep state we have to get rid of the shadow state we
[1:49:36.960 --> 1:49:41.600]  have to expose it and shine light on it and spotlight the cockroaches as my good friend
[1:49:41.600 --> 1:49:45.520]  ted knows he likes to say alright let's go back to calls who's been holding the longest
[1:49:45.520 --> 1:49:51.600]  that's chris in the great state of texas chris you're on the air welcome hi alex straight
[1:49:51.600 --> 1:49:55.800]  to talk with you it's no coincidence that you're going to talk about censorship today
[1:49:55.800 --> 1:50:04.080]  alex because when i got home last night i have a t&t uverse cable system and i went
[1:50:04.080 --> 1:50:10.520]  to oan because i don't like to watch fox news until tucker comes on and i see that oan
[1:50:10.520 --> 1:50:20.680]  is not there so i do some research and i find out that that's a t&t because of oan's content
[1:50:20.680 --> 1:50:28.120]  is does not match up with uh... the politicians in our country the democrat politicians and
[1:50:28.120 --> 1:50:34.240]  of course a t&t owns and runs cnn yeah yes sir that's a good point and again here's the
[1:50:34.240 --> 1:50:39.680]  thing that was announced two months ago and oan ran banners every hour saying go to our
[1:50:39.680 --> 1:50:46.880]  website go to cloud tv go to rocu go other places but only once they got dumped on when
[1:50:46.880 --> 1:50:50.960]  the date came i'm getting all these calls where's oan and i'm not mad at listeners for
[1:50:50.960 --> 1:50:55.520]  my show or them so i'm not in competition with oan i love them they're great guys great
[1:50:55.520 --> 1:50:59.800]  great gals the point is i'm like tell me we're being censored we're about to be shut down
[1:50:59.800 --> 1:51:03.560]  you only find us in info wars dot com or band up video please share that link and then i
[1:51:03.560 --> 1:51:07.360]  want to see your bad guy you're a regular listener you didn't know two months ago they
[1:51:07.360 --> 1:51:10.360]  got dumped off there and they said in two months you'll be off they had to give them
[1:51:10.360 --> 1:51:15.960]  two months notice alex i truthfully did not know and i i i don't sit there and watch them
[1:51:15.960 --> 1:51:20.600]  for hours listen i'm not saying you're bad that's what i'm getting at i will i talk to
[1:51:20.600 --> 1:51:25.840]  people every day on the street that go i used to love your show sorry you're off the air
[1:51:25.840 --> 1:51:30.440]  and they're smart people and i go no i'm on the air and info wars dot com and hundreds
[1:51:30.440 --> 1:51:35.280]  of stations but they think i saw you here now you're gone now you're gone people have
[1:51:35.280 --> 1:51:40.800]  to look for the truth it's not going to get forced on you at the airports and hotels and
[1:51:40.800 --> 1:51:44.960]  train stations like cnn it's going to be buried because they they fear does that make sense
[1:51:44.960 --> 1:51:50.320]  no it makes sense and how i'm going to fight back alex is first of all i found a member
[1:51:50.320 --> 1:51:55.800]  i got my coin last week and i love it and second of all i'm going to go to extendity
[1:51:55.800 --> 1:52:01.520]  and dump atn t you know and by the way i love you chris and i'm not putting you down i'm
[1:52:01.520 --> 1:52:05.880]  the same way i get busy i don't pay attention and then when something's censored i tend
[1:52:05.880 --> 1:52:10.040]  to not go to it anymore because i just remember being there so i'm the same way i've done
[1:52:10.040 --> 1:52:14.320]  a bad job explaining to people hey we're being taken off all these things you've got to come
[1:52:14.320 --> 1:52:20.120]  directly to us oan tried but they put notices up people don't watch the little notices at
[1:52:20.120 --> 1:52:25.560]  the bottom like they watch the host saying so oan should have done more announcements
[1:52:25.560 --> 1:52:29.880]  and i'm not putting them down i should have to because everything is about letting people
[1:52:29.880 --> 1:52:34.080]  know you're not going to get alex jones on instagram or youtube or twitter you're going
[1:52:34.080 --> 1:52:41.000]  to get alex jones at info wars dot com and bandot video and places like rumble and places
[1:52:41.000 --> 1:52:44.960]  like getter and places like gab and people got to go there and that's where they got
[1:52:44.960 --> 1:52:49.040]  to see it and senator paul gets this he goes i'm not going on youtube anymore after they
[1:52:49.040 --> 1:52:53.080]  censored him saying natural immunity is better he goes i'm on rumble now and his channel
[1:52:53.080 --> 1:52:57.320]  is explode same thing with bonjino we got to get people onto our platformers well guess
[1:52:57.320 --> 1:53:02.080]  what i got my own platform bandot video thanks to you guys and i'm saying that's where the
[1:53:02.080 --> 1:53:09.840]  truth is so share bandot video it's real quick i just want to say to me this is a huge huge
[1:53:09.840 --> 1:53:16.640]  domino against freedom oan was my favorite station besides info wars but on table they
[1:53:16.640 --> 1:53:23.040]  were my favorite station fox news and and newsmax are next and then info wars is next and then
[1:53:23.040 --> 1:53:29.520]  the radio is next alex it's happening this is it america wake up i agree god bless ya
[1:53:29.520 --> 1:53:34.200]  yeah let atnt know you don't support them everybody that's got atnt you should say i'm
[1:53:34.200 --> 1:53:39.280]  double my atnt unless you stop this because oan was popular oan had more ratings than
[1:53:39.280 --> 1:53:43.040]  cnn way better they tried to suppress those ratings they got scared i'll give you the
[1:53:43.040 --> 1:53:48.960]  inside baseball okay on cloud tv and a few other platforms we haven't been censored on
[1:53:48.960 --> 1:53:53.280]  we are bigger than oan but oan is the next biggest thing on there and oan was getting
[1:53:53.280 --> 1:53:59.280]  very very very popular and that's why they did what they did so the us president censored
[1:53:59.280 --> 1:54:04.400]  oan censored but but i want to get it straight info wars was taken off of the platforms first
[1:54:04.400 --> 1:54:09.840]  now they came for trump now they're coming for oan next they're coming for you so the
[1:54:09.840 --> 1:54:15.040]  caller's like well next it'll be info wars well info wars is still here but you notice
[1:54:15.040 --> 1:54:20.400]  the caller had to come to info wars or a local am or fm station who are precious everybody
[1:54:20.400 --> 1:54:24.960]  should support them all right let's take another caller here in the order they have been received
[1:54:24.960 --> 1:54:33.600]  uh vern in texas thank you vern hi alex uh thank you for taking my call uh i'm not transgender
[1:54:33.600 --> 1:54:41.760]  my real name is bronica but short for vern um listen i wanted to um i saw dr artist on
[1:54:42.480 --> 1:54:50.000]  the several interviews he did uh on the 11th two peters and vanderstahl um right me with
[1:54:50.000 --> 1:54:54.640]  mike adam you really need to get him on your show i know he went on a destroyer show i've
[1:54:54.640 --> 1:55:00.800]  heard snake venom they think snake venom's in the water yes yes and you know the amount of evidence
[1:55:00.800 --> 1:55:08.640]  he presents to substantiate his claim is remarkable and um he's you know the information actually has
[1:55:08.640 --> 1:55:14.880]  been out there on the internet since january 2020 he shows that one of the first articles
[1:55:15.680 --> 1:55:23.600]  speculated uh that was written uh speculated that the three possible sources for uh coronavirus
[1:55:23.600 --> 1:55:32.080]  were bats tangolans and snake so dr artist has done an incredible connecting of the dots um
[1:55:32.080 --> 1:55:40.400]  you know you have had ed doubt on your show uh the stock market analyst and he i was really
[1:55:40.400 --> 1:55:46.080]  impressed in his interview with christie lee because he said he prayed to god and um you know
[1:55:46.080 --> 1:55:52.080]  asked how he could be of service and then shortly thereafter um dr malone came to
[1:55:52.080 --> 1:55:58.880]  mawai and through a series of coincidences he was able to meet uh malone and steve kersh and from
[1:55:58.880 --> 1:56:06.240]  then on you know the information that ed bowed had just took off so by the same token and dr artist
[1:56:06.880 --> 1:56:14.800]  uh you know a series of coincidences remarkable coincidences uh truly inspired by god like led
[1:56:14.800 --> 1:56:21.040]  him to this supposition and then after that he was able to kind of methodically prove
[1:56:21.040 --> 1:56:29.600]  that uh coronavirus is actually uh snake venom specifically uh the kright snake and the cobra
[1:56:29.600 --> 1:56:34.000]  snake and what's interesting man let me ask you a question and i'm not poo pooing this but i'm
[1:56:34.000 --> 1:56:39.520]  going to be the top scientist we've looked at the viral scans major universities they made a virus
[1:56:39.520 --> 1:56:44.160]  viruses are able to replicate the body so do you know how much snake venom you have to put in
[1:56:44.160 --> 1:56:49.680]  water supply to have these type of blood clotting effects and things uh that that a snake bite would
[1:56:49.680 --> 1:56:54.880]  do you know a snake bites you it pumps in you know say a a tenth of an ounce of venom into your
[1:56:54.880 --> 1:57:01.680]  or or an ounce and then it makes you have blood clots in your leg rots off and you die um i'm
[1:57:01.680 --> 1:57:05.520]  not poo pooing this one we'll get artists on it's i know it's the big big thing right now
[1:57:05.520 --> 1:57:11.840]  but to to say that snake venom is being dumped in the water supply it's diluted it breaks down
[1:57:11.840 --> 1:57:17.440]  electrochemically very quickly what you want is a virus because it replicates in the body
[1:57:17.440 --> 1:57:24.080]  so it spreads quickly to say that poisons in water and then it's contagious to other people
[1:57:24.960 --> 1:57:30.400]  and i've experienced the contagion of covid is is very very interesting so uh i'm going to look
[1:57:30.400 --> 1:57:34.720]  into this and i appreciate your call i mean i started seeing this a few days ago i looked at
[1:57:34.720 --> 1:57:40.400]  it i'm like they're dumping snake venom in the water huh how many snakes they got to do that

[1:59:15.040 --> 1:59:21.520]  of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content free of charge and because
[1:59:21.520 --> 1:59:28.560]  it's become so successful it's a catch 22 info wars and bandot video have become a mother ship
[1:59:28.560 --> 1:59:34.560]  promoting the pro-human liberty movement worldwide but the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions

[2:00:16.640 --> 2:00:23.280]  absolutely uh the lord put uh on my heart to come call and give you an exhortation and just
[2:00:23.280 --> 2:00:29.040]  let you know besides the tip of the spear you're a crusader a modern day crusader for these times
[2:00:29.040 --> 2:00:34.960]  before the return of our lord and savior he i know and you've spoke we're in the days of noah
[2:00:34.960 --> 2:00:42.000]  or the days of lot and many are just not awake but you as a crusader are leading those as a type
[2:00:42.000 --> 2:00:48.480]  like noah as they came up to the sea they look behind him pharaoh's army was there today that's
[2:00:48.480 --> 2:00:56.320]  our evil and in front is a sea that is impenetrable he as the word says knew that god will make a way
[2:00:56.320 --> 2:01:01.440]  and he part of the sea he made it across you're leading people in that way into the light into the
[2:01:01.440 --> 2:01:07.360]  truth and that's going to lead to great and mighty things so i want to encourage you with what you're
[2:01:07.360 --> 2:01:12.960]  doing and to continue to do what you're doing you remind me of a modern day steven and that man
[2:01:12.960 --> 2:01:22.320]  stood before the sanhedrin and gave them literally a synopsis of the Torah and what god had planned
[2:01:22.320 --> 2:01:26.800]  for the jewish people and at the end they took him out and they stoned him but something very
[2:01:26.800 --> 2:01:31.920]  significant happened during the time of steven a man full of faith like you and the holy spirit
[2:01:31.920 --> 2:01:38.400]  like you and in that as they were getting ready to stone him he looked up and he saw jesus christ
[2:01:38.400 --> 2:01:43.440]  who is seated at the right hand of the father at this time standing at the right hand of the father
[2:01:43.440 --> 2:01:48.400]  one of the only times in the bible where it says he was seen standing at the right hand of the father
[2:01:48.400 --> 2:01:55.840]  because steven and his testimony allowed jesus to arrive psalms 58 excuse me 68 says this
[2:01:55.840 --> 2:02:02.080]  alex and i want you to hear this let god arise let his enemies be scattered let those also who
[2:02:02.080 --> 2:02:08.400]  hate him flee before him as smoke is driven away so drive them away as wax melt before the fire
[2:02:09.040 --> 2:02:17.200]  also let the wicked perish yet the presence of god you are like a steven you are standing in
[2:02:17.200 --> 2:02:24.160]  truth and as steven was stoned he fell asleep because god was with him god is with you he will
[2:02:24.160 --> 2:02:30.720]  make a way where you need finances where you're going to get what you need to do the work that he
[2:02:30.720 --> 2:02:36.160]  has called you to do you said like i say here i am board stand me he doesn't send anybody without
[2:02:36.160 --> 2:02:43.680]  giving them what they need to go and do his work so stand strong my brother believe my wife and i are
[2:02:43.680 --> 2:02:48.080]  our supporters we love everything mark we thank you and thank you god bless you on a
[2:02:48.080 --> 2:02:52.480]  compare myself it's not that great but we're all standing together with god and you're steven as

[2:06:42.000 --> 2:06:46.720]  that guy we've been hammered together so many times it's like it's that is the most misunderstood
[2:06:46.720 --> 2:06:53.200]  guy on the planet alex has been right on toward a over a decade shout out to alex jones we love you
[2:06:53.200 --> 2:06:57.360]  alex jones is a journalist and member of the media end of story recently many of the biggest
[2:06:57.360 --> 2:07:02.320]  tech companies joined in a coordinated effort to censor content from broadcaster alex jones
[2:07:02.320 --> 2:07:08.240]  there's a reason why the mainstream media calls a guy like him a palm throw or or conspiracy theorists
[2:07:08.240 --> 2:07:13.360]  because they're they're in fear of the truth that he does actually bring out why are the most
[2:07:13.360 --> 2:07:18.960]  powerful companies in the world suddenly so threatened by an independent radio show host in
[2:07:18.960 --> 2:07:23.840]  texas that they're willing to lose business in order to make him shut up he runs a media
[2:07:23.840 --> 2:07:30.080]  organization and so when the january 6 committee subpoenas him they're basically violating our
[2:07:30.080 --> 2:07:34.560]  first amendment protections the department of justice says not only is it investigating what
[2:07:34.560 --> 2:07:41.040]  happened inside the capital but the conspirators and instigators who may have started this whole
[2:07:41.040 --> 2:07:45.440]  thing now the committees decided to shut down one of the most popular journalists on the right
[2:07:45.440 --> 2:07:50.320]  alex jones yes journalist the house committee investigating the deadly assault on the u.s
[2:07:50.320 --> 2:07:56.720]  capital is subpoenaing trump allies roger stone and conspiracy theorist alex jones the committee says
[2:07:56.720 --> 2:08:02.400]  he helped organize the rally ahead of the riots alex jones isn't simply innocent of inciting
[2:08:02.400 --> 2:08:19.360]  crime on january 6 alex jones actively worked to prevent crimes from taking place on january 6
[2:08:25.520 --> 2:08:29.440]  we're not running interference for alex jones and we're not guessing about it we happen to know
[2:08:29.440 --> 2:08:43.920]  this for a fact alex jones is a journalist the same as brian stelter and jake tapper and don
[2:08:43.920 --> 2:08:48.240]  lemon are absolutely i was about to say the same thing let's hope there's not gonna be like don't
[2:08:48.240 --> 2:08:52.560]  insult alex that way well yeah yeah alex jones never lied us into a war uh right right right
[2:08:52.560 --> 2:08:58.320]  true alex jones never bought the russia hoax not for a second and if jones said that what tony
[2:08:58.320 --> 2:09:02.640]  fouchy he would ask him real questions just as journalists are supposed to do he wouldn't just
[2:09:02.640 --> 2:09:07.920]  slobber all over him ebbstein he was way ahead with that he told me about ebbstein a f***ing decade
[2:09:07.920 --> 2:09:16.240]  ago alex detailed all of that alex jones info wars the media has tarnished him with all sorts of
[2:09:16.240 --> 2:09:22.080]  name calling conspiracy theorist bomb thrower the one thing that i know about this gentleman alex
[2:09:22.080 --> 2:09:29.360]  jones is that he loves this country he is as smart as a whip he he absolutely believes
[2:09:29.920 --> 2:09:36.480]  in what he believes in and he also does his research and his homework cooly compare hotez's
[2:09:36.480 --> 2:09:43.280]  views on coven to say alex jones's views on coven and ask yourself who's saner it's not even close
[2:09:43.280 --> 2:09:50.400]  he's incredibly detailed in his research he loves this country he is a patriot and he's somebody who
[2:09:50.400 --> 2:09:54.560]  we'd better listen to our others in this country better list to visit a stretch to say that tucker
[2:09:54.560 --> 2:10:00.080]  carlson is the new alex jones there's no vaccine passports that's insane it's alex jones stuff
[2:10:00.720 --> 2:10:05.520]  and by the way just so you know as proof if you want to get a job you'll need your vaccine papers
[2:10:10.240 --> 2:10:14.640]  all right he was on with us one day and i asked him please come down from dallas and he did it

[2:10:30.400 --> 2:10:35.760]  more interested in philosophy and building a better society give sin go dot com forward slash
[2:10:35.760 --> 2:10:44.560]  ali alexander gab cruise social at ali telegram and more he joins us now ali i've got a thousand
[2:10:44.560 --> 2:10:50.800]  points to make and things go over here with you but you've been the one guy who didn't cooperate
[2:10:50.800 --> 2:10:55.760]  you were willing to go in and say we're innocent in front of the committee and now with the feds
[2:10:57.200 --> 2:11:01.840]  yeah we've done nothing wrong you were there i was there i'm just so worried about perjury traps
[2:11:01.840 --> 2:11:06.480]  that i've not wanted to walk in the lion's den but you've done it uh such an incredible time now
[2:11:06.480 --> 2:11:11.280]  whitmer and then the whole plot being confirmed by a jury to be staged you know the jury saying
[2:11:11.280 --> 2:11:16.160]  yeah i'm clear of the fb i ordered them to do this and threaten them to do this seems like the wheels
[2:11:16.160 --> 2:11:21.360]  are really coming off but the way that scares me more yeah because biden's like we need to ban
[2:11:21.360 --> 2:11:26.960]  guns and prostitutes he doesn't even know what planet he's on i don't politically go oh look
[2:11:26.960 --> 2:11:30.960]  our enemies are weak and dumb they're running the country i wish they'd wake up and stop being so
[2:11:30.960 --> 2:11:36.800]  crazy so so you said it on monday you really fear for the future of the country so do i yeah i you
[2:11:36.800 --> 2:11:42.400]  know a couple years ago i came on your air and we talked about what i believed was what i called
[2:11:42.400 --> 2:11:48.080]  inversion you know and it looks like that's what they're doing to our country and what they attempt
[2:11:48.080 --> 2:11:53.120]  to do is not pin just two sides against each other but to invert those two sides against each
[2:11:53.120 --> 2:11:58.080]  other so you have the the corporates and the progressives they're currently imploding the left
[2:11:58.080 --> 2:12:03.040]  and over here on the right you have the corporates and the populace and we're over here imploding and
[2:12:03.040 --> 2:12:08.720]  so i don't think it's a coincidence that the media is acknowledging the hunter biden laptop
[2:12:08.720 --> 2:12:16.240]  while the j6 sham is going on why they need to give something to everybody to radicalize everyone
[2:12:16.240 --> 2:12:20.960]  so that they have more situations like what just happened in new york city i mean it's
[2:12:20.960 --> 2:12:24.720]  kind of fascinating that people are still wearing their mask still going on the subway
[2:12:25.520 --> 2:12:29.360]  after what happened yesterday but that's what they want they want to just set the whole damn
[2:12:29.360 --> 2:12:35.840]  country on fire that's it it's a costume set a angrier world and out of the collapse we will
[2:12:35.840 --> 2:12:40.720]  build back better that's what it is these people believe order out of chaos they believe they must
[2:12:40.720 --> 2:12:45.120]  break things down you know these people are alchemists they fancy themselves as alchemists
[2:12:45.120 --> 2:12:49.440]  and what they want to do is they want to break things down and then rebuild them up it's part
[2:12:49.440 --> 2:12:55.040]  of the transgender movement as well it's not even a movement the the transgender programming you know
[2:12:55.040 --> 2:12:59.680]  baphomet i mean you know read that little latin phrase underneath baphomet you know
[2:12:59.680 --> 2:13:05.600]  solvay equagula you know so these people are experts at breaking we're mixing everything yeah
[2:13:05.600 --> 2:13:11.600]  yeah to recongeal and so you know this is what they want they want us to live in this this global
[2:13:11.600 --> 2:13:17.280]  one state one religion one thought and we're all economic units building their pyramid their life
[2:13:17.280 --> 2:13:23.840]  extension machines and you know j6 is a part of that michigan is a part of that hunter biden's laptop
[2:13:23.840 --> 2:13:27.520]  is a part of that there's going to be things you agree with and things you disagree with
[2:13:27.520 --> 2:13:31.680]  but they'll be able to feed something to everybody regardless their turn of the temperature up that's
[2:13:31.680 --> 2:13:35.840]  what we need to dial the temperature down and i think we have and i think that that's why they're
[2:13:35.840 --> 2:13:42.240]  so frustrated alex you know if there's two people who can relate to each other and what we're going
[2:13:42.240 --> 2:13:46.320]  through both in the public eye and then we've been through some wars we've been through some wars
[2:13:46.320 --> 2:13:52.400]  and you know what i think is that they mean for us to go crazy they mean for other people like
[2:13:52.400 --> 2:13:59.920]  you know matthew perna a j6 defendant the justice system played with him until he committed suicide
[2:13:59.920 --> 2:14:04.640]  and they want the same for me they want the same for you you know donald trump's never going to come
[2:14:04.640 --> 2:14:09.600]  close to it but you know they just put us through this iron this investigation and it goes nowhere
[2:14:09.600 --> 2:14:14.640]  and they they make you caricatures while they deplatform you so that people run up to you
[2:14:14.640 --> 2:14:19.280]  you know we're walking in public i've been ran up to and people you know attack me at the airport
[2:14:19.280 --> 2:14:23.280]  you know i was on an airplane this guy takes a picture of me all he's on this flight and he's
[2:14:23.280 --> 2:14:28.320]  landing at this time you know it's it's uh it's a bizarre time to be alive but they can't oh they're
[2:14:28.320 --> 2:14:33.840]  all like little secret agents like us existings criminal yeah well look they're talking oh look
[2:14:35.120 --> 2:14:39.840]  yeah you know it's it's absolutely fascinating to me i have i have my periscope videos i was one
[2:14:39.840 --> 2:14:44.400]  of the most popular people on the periscope service and they have all these videos and now the press
[2:14:44.400 --> 2:14:51.600]  reports it as now deleted videos uh twitter deleted my yeah like ollie i saw ollie alexander
[2:14:51.600 --> 2:14:57.280]  national news hiding videos you were bitching when they took your channel yeah yeah so i when i got
[2:14:57.280 --> 2:15:02.800]  sued i've been sanctioned like you got rid of your youtube your sanctioned no they did yeah they took
[2:15:02.800 --> 2:15:08.800]  it away and what's what's amazing about this and folks really need to take a step back is alex
[2:15:08.800 --> 2:15:17.520]  jones accused of anything that he hasn't voluntarily or publicly said that in context makes sense the
[2:15:17.520 --> 2:15:24.160]  answer is no is there anything that ollie alexander has not volunteered to the public that you know
[2:15:24.160 --> 2:15:28.240]  the new york times then writes as a headline like ollie said that he was going to coordinate with the
[2:15:28.240 --> 2:15:33.040]  proud boys when the proud boys got kicked from their hotel i made a call and said this is wrong
[2:15:33.040 --> 2:15:39.120]  this is silver rights abuse that was the extent of that but that didn't stop the j6 committee from
[2:15:39.120 --> 2:15:44.480]  don't from from committing tens of thousands maybe hundreds of thousands of dollars in investigating
[2:15:44.480 --> 2:15:49.760]  me over the con but let's be clear it's it's bigger than ollie alexander all it seems they're coming
[2:15:49.760 --> 2:15:54.160]  after america on jan six all of us so you're all sick of hearing about it folks to get ready to
[2:15:54.160 --> 2:16:00.720]  stage major stuff in my view you know it's a fact and i'm out bragging when i say it it's just true

[2:20:19.120 --> 2:20:23.920]  ollie alexander is my guest in studio and he's a really smart political analyst of pro america
[2:20:23.920 --> 2:20:29.920]  pundit ollie i want to be clear with people that our listeners know we didn't stage january 6 they
[2:20:29.920 --> 2:20:36.320]  know it was provocative by the feds and some and some idiot groups that got played into it but
[2:20:36.320 --> 2:20:42.320]  they're betting the whole election they now admit in 209 days on this and they're staying false
[2:20:42.320 --> 2:20:47.840]  flags are coming by trump supporters that challenge elections and they're actively investigating you
[2:20:47.840 --> 2:20:53.120]  and i as masterminds even though we know we're totally innocent and so this is a big deal for
[2:20:53.120 --> 2:21:00.400]  everybody this is the democrat play you have these headlines here democrats death march we talk
[2:21:00.400 --> 2:21:05.760]  about how unpopular they are and how all the polls show the biggest political realignment ever
[2:21:05.760 --> 2:21:11.680]  but they're betting everything on january 6 which without a false flag or some new crime committed
[2:21:11.680 --> 2:21:17.600]  by quote jan sixers is going to fall flat on its face so obviously you've got to be a moron not to
[2:21:17.600 --> 2:21:22.640]  know they're planning something big so that's why this is so important yeah yes we care about
[2:21:22.640 --> 2:21:27.360]  ourselves yes we're under attack but this is a lot bigger explain that to people they need they need
[2:21:27.360 --> 2:21:33.280]  puppets you know these people are master storytellers and what they need is to fill in the banks so
[2:21:33.280 --> 2:21:39.040]  they've already said here's the crime here's how it happened there's no evidence for it and then
[2:21:39.040 --> 2:21:43.360]  they outlaw american opposition in questioning elections that's the key people like okay great
[2:21:44.320 --> 2:21:49.920]  this is labeling america as terrorists like you see the school boards saying questioning
[2:21:49.920 --> 2:21:54.320]  transgenderism or your kid getting raped or critical race theories terror this is really
[2:21:54.320 --> 2:22:00.000]  branding you as a terrorist so they get away with us it's you yeah it's it's absolutely you next it's
[2:22:00.000 --> 2:22:04.880]  actually you now you know let me go ahead and break some news i've not i've not told any reporter
[2:22:04.880 --> 2:22:11.680]  this and and only my lawyers and i are aware of this but the january 6 committee is going to try
[2:22:11.680 --> 2:22:17.760]  to out lie out out uh outlaw bitcoin okay they're gonna i mean this is this sounds kind of crazy
[2:22:17.760 --> 2:22:23.440]  but this like canada but this is where this is leading and i knew this in december okay but i
[2:22:23.440 --> 2:22:27.200]  want to break it here on info wars so what what you're gonna see the committee do they're gonna
[2:22:27.200 --> 2:22:33.120]  say well donald trump did this roger stone did this rudy did this all he did this alex did this
[2:22:33.120 --> 2:22:37.360]  here's criminal referrals here's things we're not going to criminally refer but we really like
[2:22:37.360 --> 2:22:43.840]  wink wink nudge nudge the justice department to move on and here are 10 policy recommendations
[2:22:43.840 --> 2:22:48.880]  to keep the right wing from ever organizing again you're gonna see recommendations in there that
[2:22:48.880 --> 2:22:54.800]  try to outlaw telegram try to outlaw or censor bitcoin increase the regulatory environment
[2:22:54.800 --> 2:22:59.360]  for bitcoin so that's harder for more americans to get in while the rest of the world competes
[2:22:59.360 --> 2:23:04.560]  with us on this sovereign on this sovereign currency i mean it's it's very astute this is
[2:23:04.560 --> 2:23:09.920]  about outlawing protests at all of its funding yeah i mean and and think about this i mean you
[2:23:09.920 --> 2:23:14.880]  were you were a pioneer when i was you know still eating the kind of the state narrative
[2:23:14.880 --> 2:23:19.840]  around 9 11 so the 9 11 commission did the same thing it's like oh we're here our liberties you
[2:23:19.840 --> 2:23:24.480]  need to take away from everyday americans and by the way we need to go and track the library books
[2:23:24.480 --> 2:23:28.640]  that they're renting at the library and people need to take off shoes at the airport because one
[2:23:28.640 --> 2:23:34.240]  person had a failed attempt at a shoe bomb allegedly so you know what we're about to see is this isn't
[2:23:34.240 --> 2:23:41.360]  about me and you alex they will use us in puppets in their fake story to make policy recommendations
[2:23:41.360 --> 2:23:46.000]  that rhino republicans and corporates democrats will pass by large majorities
[2:23:47.600 --> 2:23:52.320]  debt please continue i mean and everybody's screwed unless we continue to speak up what
[2:23:52.320 --> 2:23:57.280]  these people love is they love surprising people that's why they must be platform us so the more
[2:23:57.280 --> 2:24:02.080]  that we talk about this stuff the more that that the american citizen and our neighbors can see that
[2:24:02.080 --> 2:24:08.080]  we have scoops on info wars and we have scoops on revolver news and all these independent media
[2:24:08.080 --> 2:24:13.040]  outlets the more people will stop trusting cnn i think you have an article there that shows that
[2:24:13.040 --> 2:24:18.240]  cnn spent how much money to get 10 000 viewers i mean 300 plus million that's state media i mean
[2:24:18.240 --> 2:24:23.920]  that's just subsidized 300 million 10 000 viewers a week i mean that's a joke yeah give me a fraction
[2:24:23.920 --> 2:24:28.720]  of that money and we'll go super viral but no it's it's really unfortunate like what they're doing
[2:24:28.720 --> 2:24:33.600]  and i'll say this you know i'm really happy to be in studio today and i'm happy to be with you
[2:24:33.600 --> 2:24:37.280]  one because you know it's good to be next to somebody who's going through some of the same
[2:24:37.280 --> 2:24:43.680]  hell that we are but i i think i've done this whole 15 months wrong a lot of it's been woe is me
[2:24:43.680 --> 2:24:47.840]  why isn't the conservative movement doing this or that and then i've been watching the series
[2:24:47.840 --> 2:24:51.600]  the chosen which has been really good i've been getting some counseling from some some christian
[2:24:51.600 --> 2:24:57.360]  friends and they're just like you got a smile through this morally and so you know i think that
[2:24:57.360 --> 2:25:03.360]  i think that like that's my task that's kind of my cross to bury right now but everybody everybody
[2:25:03.360 --> 2:25:07.840]  if you're listening to this you are part of this and you can play a role in this you need a red
[2:25:07.840 --> 2:25:12.320]  pill your neighbor you need to make prophetic statements about the j6 committee and what they're
[2:25:12.320 --> 2:25:17.680]  going to do to you and your neighbors so that when that time comes around your neighbor says
[2:25:17.680 --> 2:25:22.160]  wow that person's right what channel do they watch well they watch info wars and that's
[2:25:22.160 --> 2:25:27.520]  totally true god wants to see us do the right thing now when we're under attack yeah and it's hard
[2:25:27.520 --> 2:25:34.160]  i mean it's hard this is this is the toughest time in my life i have lost close friends allies
[2:25:34.160 --> 2:25:40.560]  family members most your money most of my money my my life savings is gone you know i've had to
[2:25:40.560 --> 2:25:46.560]  secretly subcontract on two campaigns but now that's over so it's you know if you're going
[2:25:46.560 --> 2:25:51.360]  through hell just keep on going and i have to believe that there's a great awakening happened
[2:25:51.360 --> 2:25:55.840]  with the american people and i think that they're pissed but let's not be so pissed that we give them
[2:25:55.840 --> 2:26:01.760]  exactly what they want so you know we have to be don't this is the only thing we have to be moderate
[2:26:01.760 --> 2:26:07.360]  about is our anger you know towards the deep state i think it's true so so clearly what are they
[2:26:07.360 --> 2:26:11.920]  going to do next they're obsessing over it it's their whole agenda everything you do is make
[2:26:11.920 --> 2:26:15.920]  people hate them but they just go January 6 watch you'll see what happens clearly they're planning
[2:26:15.920 --> 2:26:22.160]  something back something huge and it's not just this election alex it's both elections it's 2022
[2:26:22.160 --> 2:26:27.760]  and it's 2024 about 2022 it's about capping the red wave you have to think about this way if
[2:26:27.760 --> 2:26:32.880]  kevin mccarthy gets too large a red wave the conservatives are in control if kevin mccarthy
[2:26:32.880 --> 2:26:37.360]  just gets a little off the tip top then he's in control and then we're just going to have horrible
[2:26:37.360 --> 2:26:41.360]  legislation they're not going to go on offense we're not going to have a committee that investigates
[2:26:41.360 --> 2:26:46.000]  the summer riots we're not going to have a reverse j6 committee to investigate the insurrection that
[2:26:46.000 --> 2:26:50.880]  happened on november 3rd and the fbi setup that happened on january 6 we're not going to have any
[2:26:50.880 --> 2:26:55.040]  of that so what they're trying to do and this is what mit romney and list chain you're doing
[2:26:55.040 --> 2:27:01.440]  they're setting us up for a tiny red wave so that they can control it and then 2024 will all be about
[2:27:01.440 --> 2:27:06.960]  pinning disantis and trump against each other by taking trump off of a ballot or two i mean this
[2:27:06.960 --> 2:27:12.080]  is the coup part three and what's frustrating is ollie you are very successful political
[2:27:12.080 --> 2:27:17.120]  analysts people respect you yeah but and i know this stuff in our audience knows this but mainline
[2:27:17.120 --> 2:27:24.160]  republicans don't even get any of this they won't touch it they won't touch it it alex they really
[2:27:24.160 --> 2:27:28.080]  won't touch it they're like okay everything you're saying ollie you know shows that you've read up on
[2:27:28.080 --> 2:27:33.280]  these state ballot access laws and you're watching you know alias and what he's doing but you know
[2:27:33.280 --> 2:27:40.560]  they just by the way alias are trying to get a bunch of republicans banned yeah from like mtg
[2:27:40.560 --> 2:27:45.920]  because they question election fraud which is your right to do it's it's so much worse i got a call
[2:27:45.920 --> 2:27:51.280]  from a source in atlanta yesterday and just you know the green light the democrats have at the state
[2:27:51.280 --> 2:27:56.160]  level and the federal level nobody's ever seen anything like this in this country right now
[2:27:56.160 --> 2:28:02.560]  there are active measures in 12 different states and none of its public i've never seen anything
[2:28:02.560 --> 2:28:06.640]  like explain what active measures means well you know active measures in the community intelligence
[2:28:06.640 --> 2:28:12.640]  is you know when when somebody's doing something and uh... what what's happening what what what
[2:28:12.640 --> 2:28:18.320]  must be a criminal enterprise and what must be a criminal conspiracy is that you have state attorney
[2:28:18.320 --> 2:28:24.400]  generals county attorney uh... district attorneys and then u.s. attorney u.s. attorneys in paneling
[2:28:24.400 --> 2:28:29.920]  grand juries everywhere you know i went public on my grand jury because new york times is going to
[2:28:29.920 --> 2:28:34.560]  go public on it anyway so i had a choice of giving comment or not giving comment but folks
[2:28:34.560 --> 2:28:39.680]  my sources are telling me at the state level they got other grand juries and they want to take mtg
[2:28:39.680 --> 2:28:44.640]  and all other people off the ballot and in civil matters i have top lawyers they go we've never
[2:28:44.640 --> 2:28:50.480]  seen judges do this they just are raping us our rights totally right it's a democrat globalist
[2:28:50.480 --> 2:28:59.600]  coup folks they know america woke up they're trying to block us we'll be right back it's about 25 years
[2:28:59.600 --> 2:29:04.080]  ago that i wanted to expand in for worse i've been on the air a couple years but i only had money
[2:29:04.080 --> 2:29:08.960]  to finance my own simple little local radio show i wanted to hire camera people i wanted to make

[2:32:59.840 --> 2:33:07.840]  Broadcasting of Frontal Assault on the Lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:30.840 --> 2:33:37.840]  Ali Alexander is here with us. He's going to be popping out in the War Room today with Owen Schreuer coming up at 3 p.m. today.
[2:33:37.840 --> 2:33:43.840]  We've got this big, epic times investigative report on feds confirmed embedded in Jan 6.
[2:33:43.840 --> 2:33:53.840]  20 federal assets embedded at Capitol on Jan 6. Court filing says Oath Keepers' motion ceases to dismiss seditious conspiracy charges.
[2:33:53.840 --> 2:34:03.840]  And we have that legal document right here. This is a big deal because they're trying to frame America and label all opposition off January 6 as terrorists.
[2:34:03.840 --> 2:34:05.840]  That's why conservatives need to take this seriously.
[2:34:05.840 --> 2:34:12.840]  We need to take it seriously. And our side's not taking it seriously enough. I'm done combating the other side.
[2:34:12.840 --> 2:34:19.840]  What we need to do is we need to wake up other lions. We need to wake up our allies and start going into war.
[2:34:19.840 --> 2:34:23.840]  You know, Alex, I think I said it on your air because I've certainly said it in private enough times.
[2:34:23.840 --> 2:34:33.840]  Folks, it was BuzzFeed News that exonerated these guys in Michigan with the Whitmer case that's a fake kidnapping case, okay?
[2:34:33.840 --> 2:34:35.840]  Which was a prelude to J6.
[2:34:35.840 --> 2:34:39.840]  And why did they do that? It's the whole liberal gamble and a liberal publication first exposes it.
[2:34:39.840 --> 2:34:45.840]  I think, again, I think it's accidental. What happens is you file a FOIA request and you're like, you start tugging at it.
[2:34:45.840 --> 2:34:49.840]  And then what they want to do is that they want to go viral. They want to do good journalism and yada, yada, yada.
[2:34:49.840 --> 2:34:51.840]  Yeah, there's a real drive to tell the truth.
[2:34:51.840 --> 2:34:58.840]  Yeah, so occasionally, and frankly, this is what, you know, back in the Twitter days, Mike Cernovich, me and Jack Busopic,
[2:34:58.840 --> 2:35:05.840]  when Harvey Weinstein was going through his thing, it actually started dying after the 72-hour mark.
[2:35:05.840 --> 2:35:14.840]  It was a mini news cycle. And then what we did is we incentivized the journalists by dangling women who, like, had DM'd us and all kinds of other stuff.
[2:35:14.840 --> 2:35:19.840]  You know, these aren't conservative people in Hollywood, but they were people who were looking for an outlet and journalists wouldn't listen.
[2:35:19.840 --> 2:35:25.840]  And you would dangle that in front of people like Yashara Ali, who is the most obese-discussing journalist out there.
[2:35:25.840 --> 2:35:33.840]  And they would start doing stories. So what happens, and Andrew Breitbart got this, is what you have to do in major stories like this is change the incentive program.
[2:35:33.840 --> 2:35:41.840]  And if you change the incentive program, then you incentivize those independent journalists and these journalists who want to get hired at a different outlet.
[2:35:41.840 --> 2:35:48.840]  And so what happened with BuzzFeed is they did the FOIA request, they found out the FBI was hiding something, they pulled a string that they didn't know.
[2:35:48.840 --> 2:35:59.840]  And seriously, I'm not going to thank BuzzFeed because they are total trash, but they did 90% of the legal legwork for these guys in Michigan.
[2:35:59.840 --> 2:36:06.840]  And now it's all been confirmed. And this is so seismic because the same FBI people running the Whitmer kidnapping,
[2:36:06.840 --> 2:36:11.840]  they wanted to trick their people to cut their head off. Now they were caught running Jam 6, it's come out.
[2:36:11.840 --> 2:36:22.840]  Right. And so what it turns out is that the agent in charge of overseeing all these other corrupt agents who totally, they violate the FBI handbook, they violate it, protocol.
[2:36:22.840 --> 2:36:35.840]  And the protocol is pretty liberal after 9-11. You can basically, as an FBI agent, do what you want to convince somebody, whether it's a young Muslim or a white patriot,
[2:36:35.840 --> 2:36:40.840]  convince them to say anything and then send them to jail with no intention of really committing a crime.
[2:36:40.840 --> 2:36:46.840]  And shame on us on the right for somehow, I participated in that when I was younger.
[2:36:46.840 --> 2:36:53.840]  And I hate that I ever participated in kind of stigmatizing other Americans, even if they didn't believe what I believed.
[2:36:53.840 --> 2:37:00.840]  But now looking back on it, so anyway, this guy in Michigan was moved over to D.C. to oversee the January 6 cases.
[2:37:00.840 --> 2:37:09.840]  So what you're watching is, you know, the death of law and order. And this is what I really want to point out that a lot of people other than lawyers can't appreciate.
[2:37:09.840 --> 2:37:24.840]  Okay. When there are confirmed assets in an environment that goes from a protest to a riot, what you need to understand is that there are nearly 800 people charged.
[2:37:24.840 --> 2:37:31.840]  Okay. The Constitution and common law say that you're allowed to build what's called an adequate defense.
[2:37:31.840 --> 2:37:38.840]  Okay. That's not a phrase out of nowhere. That is the standard by which the state must guarantee someone who is charged.
[2:37:38.840 --> 2:37:44.840]  Well, no one can build an adequate defense if the government has not given disclosure.
[2:37:44.840 --> 2:37:56.840]  And so let me tell the government this. Yes, I regularly talk to J6 defendant lawyers, over 30 of them, and they tell me about the evidence that they're looking at on these secure laptops.
[2:37:56.840 --> 2:38:02.840]  And they're not allowed to make it public. So they can't talk to anybody about it. They can't screenshot it. They can't do anything.
[2:38:02.840 --> 2:38:08.840]  The judges won't let it. And this evidence, in one case, would exonerate five other cases.
[2:38:08.840 --> 2:38:16.840]  So what you're watching is a slow-moving train wreck of plea deals. And what happens is... And have they sent the president for this? Yes.
[2:38:16.840 --> 2:38:24.840]  It's the model for all the rest of the country. Right. And so what happens is, let's say I get 20 plea deals. Well, then this next person takes the plea deal.
[2:38:24.840 --> 2:38:32.840]  And then they get a harsher sentence because they didn't... Or they get taken to a jury trial or a bench trial, and then they get convicted.
[2:38:32.840 --> 2:38:36.840]  And then, well, they get a harsher sentence because they have to have a harsher sentence than the plea deal.
[2:38:36.840 --> 2:38:43.840]  And so what happens is, when the exonerating information comes out here, and then all these people who got a plea deal say,
[2:38:43.840 --> 2:38:48.840]  well, actually, we want to revisit it, the judges say, no, we're going to quash that motion. We're going to quash that.
[2:38:48.840 --> 2:38:55.840]  Or when these people say, I want a new trial, the appellate court will say, no, because your trial was conducted fairly.
[2:38:55.840 --> 2:39:04.840]  So, Ali, let me ask you this. What... Because I've been asked, what happened to N6? I don't know. We went and had a big rally, you got hijacked, taking control of.
[2:39:04.840 --> 2:39:09.840]  We know there was some feds there, some patriots and some dumb stuff, but we know the feds infiltrated. We know they were watching.
[2:39:09.840 --> 2:39:16.840]  We know they wouldn't give the National Guard. We know they sent half the Capitol Police away. We need an investigation of the feds. Who does that?
[2:39:16.840 --> 2:39:22.840]  Who does that? We need a special counsel. We need it. We absolutely need a special counsel.
[2:39:22.840 --> 2:39:26.840]  And in Congress, what you want is the committees that have subpoena power.
[2:39:26.840 --> 2:39:31.840]  And so there's only a couple committees in the House that have subpoena power.
[2:39:31.840 --> 2:39:41.840]  And this is the power to compel someone to show up. And so the Intelligence Committee, the Judiciary Committee, these are committees that you want in it.
[2:39:41.840 --> 2:39:44.840]  Now, if it's the Intelligence Committee, most of their work will be done in secret.
[2:39:44.840 --> 2:39:49.840]  So really, it's like you want the oversight or the Judiciary Committee conducted this.
[2:39:49.840 --> 2:39:52.840]  What we really need to do is we need to chop up the investigation.
[2:39:52.840 --> 2:40:02.840]  So I would give oversight over the FBI and government officials, National Guard, National Archives and all that other stuff to the House Oversight Committee.
[2:40:02.840 --> 2:40:09.840]  As far as these secret federal agents and the shoot-to-kill agents, the ones that had kill orders that were defending pimps.
[2:40:09.840 --> 2:40:15.840]  Upwards of a thousand of them. Imagine, like you and I almost stopped it from happening.
[2:40:15.840 --> 2:40:18.840]  Imagine that we had a thousand feds with us saying, don't go in the Capitol.
[2:40:18.840 --> 2:40:28.840]  And we're criticized for leaving and exiting the chaos scene and being on a rooftop while other people are on a rooftop with guns and snipers.
[2:40:28.840 --> 2:40:30.840]  You know, and there's no criticism of the government that.
[2:40:30.840 --> 2:40:36.840]  So I would give that to the Senate Judiciary Committee or the Senate Intelligence Committee.
[2:40:36.840 --> 2:40:39.840]  But we absolutely need a special counsel, and that means we need to win the White House.
[2:40:39.840 --> 2:40:44.840]  And the reason it's important is they're branding all American opposition and official government documents.
[2:40:44.840 --> 2:40:48.840]  Is anybody that questions elections or lockdowns or anything is a terrorist.
[2:40:48.840 --> 2:40:49.840]  They are literally.
[2:40:49.840 --> 2:40:55.840]  If you wear camouflage to a rally from now on, you get what's called an FBI threat tag.
[2:40:55.840 --> 2:40:57.840]  Okay. That hasn't always been the case.
[2:40:57.840 --> 2:41:02.840]  Think about this. We survived the Tea Party. We survived the Giffords shooting.
[2:41:02.840 --> 2:41:09.840]  We survived all of those controversies where still you could wear militia gear and not automatically get tagged.
[2:41:09.840 --> 2:41:14.840]  Now, because of January 6th and what they did to our beautiful, peaceful protest.
[2:41:14.840 --> 2:41:20.840]  If you wear camouflage at any protest across this country and the FBI can identify you,
[2:41:20.840 --> 2:41:27.840]  you get what's called an FBI threat tag associated with you and you get an FBI profile created for you.
[2:41:27.840 --> 2:41:34.840]  That establishes probable cause for other policing units inside of our government.
[2:41:34.840 --> 2:41:39.840]  Ali Alexander, how do we stop a civil war that globalists are trying to trigger?
[2:41:39.840 --> 2:41:41.840]  How do we de-escalate this?
[2:41:41.840 --> 2:41:45.840]  Well, you know, I want to, in that I want to answer the question you just asked.
[2:41:45.840 --> 2:41:47.840]  What happened January 6th? I don't know.
[2:41:47.840 --> 2:41:56.840]  And I'm actually convinced that some of the conspiracy ends and then Satan's domain starts.
[2:41:56.840 --> 2:42:04.840]  Because I, you know, you follow this stuff way more than I have, you know, and you've done it for over 25 years.
[2:42:04.840 --> 2:42:08.840]  And I have a great understanding of campaigns, large organizations and government.
[2:42:08.840 --> 2:42:15.840]  But I don't see something like this fully cooperating with each other without a supernatural force influencing everything.
[2:42:15.840 --> 2:42:19.840]  You just can't coordinate 20,000 people to kind of cooperate.
[2:42:19.840 --> 2:42:28.840]  I mean, it took Trump being betrayed by operatives at the ellipse by not giving the people instructions to other things.
[2:42:28.840 --> 2:42:30.840]  I'll just leave that out in the middle.
[2:42:30.840 --> 2:42:31.840]  And then they don't send Trump there.
[2:42:31.840 --> 2:42:32.840]  Yeah.
[2:42:32.840 --> 2:42:36.840]  And I mean, it took every element of our government failing, every organizer failing.
[2:42:36.840 --> 2:42:38.840]  It's, I mean, it's kind of spooky.
[2:42:38.840 --> 2:42:40.840]  But so how do we prevent a civil war?
[2:42:40.840 --> 2:42:41.840]  I mean it.
[2:42:41.840 --> 2:42:45.840]  It's not a cheesy Christian line when I say, first we must pray.
[2:42:45.840 --> 2:42:50.840]  You know, because Ali Alexander, I totally agree. Let's come right back and talk about this and so much more.
[2:42:50.840 --> 2:43:16.840]  Ali Alexander is her guest.
[2:43:16.840 --> 2:43:22.840]  That is all sorts of designer shirts that cost us $15, $20, $25 to produce.
[2:43:22.840 --> 2:43:27.840]  We used to sell for 40, we're selling them for 15, selling them for 20, whatever the shirt costs us.
[2:43:27.840 --> 2:43:31.840]  The shirt costs $5, we're selling it for $5 for us to actually produce.
[2:43:31.840 --> 2:43:33.840]  It costs $10, we're selling it for $10.
[2:43:33.840 --> 2:43:37.840]  And we've got hoodies and we've got long sleeves and we've got short sleeves.
[2:43:37.840 --> 2:43:39.840]  We've got them all and we've got to liquidate them all.
[2:43:39.840 --> 2:43:44.840]  And they're limited edition because we're never going to make any of these designs again.
[2:43:44.840 --> 2:43:49.840]  We are going to come out with some new designs that will be limited and limited edition in the future.
[2:43:49.840 --> 2:43:51.840]  We've got to sell this to keep M4s on the air.
[2:43:51.840 --> 2:43:54.840]  Plus it spreads the word infowarstore.com.
[2:43:54.840 --> 2:43:57.840]  Here historic apparel now infowarstore.com.
[2:43:57.840 --> 2:44:08.840]  If I had to describe with just one word, the brainwashing, the mind control, the asleep prince,
[2:44:08.840 --> 2:44:15.840]  but the general public is in, the best word would actually be the people are lost.
[2:44:15.840 --> 2:44:21.840]  Just like you're lost to sleep or lost in a bad nightmare or you're in a car or you get knocked out
[2:44:21.840 --> 2:44:28.840]  and you've lost your bearings because you are totally dizzy and confused.
[2:44:28.840 --> 2:44:31.840]  You have a concussion and that's what the globalists have done.
[2:44:31.840 --> 2:44:33.840]  They have stunned us.
[2:44:33.840 --> 2:44:38.840]  They've put us into a position of not knowing our bearings and then Klaus Schwab recently came out and gave him a speech
[2:44:38.840 --> 2:44:42.840]  he called The Great New Narrative where he brags how the public is lost,
[2:44:42.840 --> 2:44:47.840]  how the culture in the media has been driven to make sure the people are all alone
[2:44:47.840 --> 2:44:50.840]  so they can now guide humanity over the edge of a cliff.
[2:44:50.840 --> 2:44:52.840]  That's what the great reset is.
[2:44:52.840 --> 2:44:53.840]  They need darkness to thrive.

[2:46:57.840 --> 2:47:02.840]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order
[2:47:02.840 --> 2:47:05.840]  it's Alex Jones
[2:47:05.840 --> 2:47:07.840]  All right, we're back.
[2:47:07.840 --> 2:47:11.840]  Kate Dowley takes over in the fourth hour ahead of Owen Schreuer
[2:47:11.840 --> 2:47:13.840]  in the war room
[2:47:13.840 --> 2:47:15.840]  and Ollie's going to be popping it on that show
[2:47:15.840 --> 2:47:17.840]  we appreciate him staying in Austin to do that
[2:47:17.840 --> 2:47:18.840]  he lives in Dallas.
[2:47:18.840 --> 2:47:20.840]  Ollie, I see headlines like this everywhere
[2:47:20.840 --> 2:47:22.840]  Democrat death march to November
[2:47:22.840 --> 2:47:24.840]  everything they're doing is hurting them
[2:47:24.840 --> 2:47:26.840]  they seem not going to do anything about it
[2:47:26.840 --> 2:47:28.840]  but they're not going to do anything about it
[2:47:28.840 --> 2:47:30.840]  they're not going to do anything about it
[2:47:30.840 --> 2:47:32.840]  they're not going to do anything about it
[2:47:32.840 --> 2:47:35.840]  everything they're doing is hurting them
[2:47:35.840 --> 2:47:37.840]  they seem not to care
[2:47:37.840 --> 2:47:38.840]  they're under orders to do something
[2:47:38.840 --> 2:47:40.840]  why are they so airing them?
[2:47:40.840 --> 2:47:44.840]  You know, well one, they have collaboration and cooperation
[2:47:44.840 --> 2:47:46.840]  from Rhino Republicans
[2:47:46.840 --> 2:47:48.840]  so like I said, that's to temper the red waves
[2:47:48.840 --> 2:47:50.840]  so they know that's coming, okay
[2:47:50.840 --> 2:47:53.840]  so imagine when the J6 report comes out
[2:47:53.840 --> 2:47:57.840]  and then the DOJ weeks later announces
[2:47:57.840 --> 2:47:59.840]  Soviet style charges
[2:47:59.840 --> 2:48:02.840]  and then they get denounced by Republicans
[2:48:02.840 --> 2:48:04.840]  Alex, I was talking to someone
[2:48:04.840 --> 2:48:06.840]  I was talking to a conservative publisher
[2:48:06.840 --> 2:48:09.840]  and I explained to that conservative publisher
[2:48:09.840 --> 2:48:11.840]  you don't need to convince the public
[2:48:11.840 --> 2:48:14.840]  they need to chill white women
[2:48:14.840 --> 2:48:16.840]  who have ping pong between the two parties
[2:48:16.840 --> 2:48:19.840]  and that affects like 30 or 40 different districts in America
[2:48:19.840 --> 2:48:21.840]  so it's like Fulton County
[2:48:21.840 --> 2:48:23.840]  it's Orange County in California
[2:48:23.840 --> 2:48:26.840]  and that means the difference of this many seats
[2:48:26.840 --> 2:48:29.840]  and so they're targeting white women
[2:48:29.840 --> 2:48:30.840]  okay with these things
[2:48:30.840 --> 2:48:32.840]  and white women don't like scandals
[2:48:32.840 --> 2:48:35.840]  they don't like the accusation of being called a racist
[2:48:35.840 --> 2:48:37.840]  but they don't like CRT
[2:48:37.840 --> 2:48:40.840]  so right now we have CRT turning out white women
[2:48:40.840 --> 2:48:41.840]  in record numbers for their...
[2:48:41.840 --> 2:48:43.840]  Is that a hammer CRT?
[2:48:43.840 --> 2:48:44.840]  Yeah, we gotta hammer it
[2:48:44.840 --> 2:48:46.840]  you know, if I was advising
[2:48:46.840 --> 2:48:48.840]  some of these giant Republican organizations
[2:48:48.840 --> 2:48:51.840]  I would say CRT is something that the Tea Party
[2:48:51.840 --> 2:48:53.840]  stopped to steal and Trump wasn't
[2:48:53.840 --> 2:48:57.840]  because these white women know their little five-year-old white babies aren't racist
[2:48:57.840 --> 2:48:59.840]  they know their babies ain't a racist
[2:48:59.840 --> 2:49:01.840]  and they know they don't want them to come home and call them a racist
[2:49:01.840 --> 2:49:03.840]  okay, you know
[2:49:03.840 --> 2:49:04.840]  when you send your kid to college
[2:49:04.840 --> 2:49:06.840]  you think they might come home and call me a racist
[2:49:06.840 --> 2:49:10.840]  you don't send your elementary school to elementary
[2:49:10.840 --> 2:49:13.840]  and think, well, they're gonna want a sex change and call me a racist
[2:49:13.840 --> 2:49:16.840]  they're also exactly the LGBT sex change stuff
[2:49:16.840 --> 2:49:17.840]  get some
[2:49:17.840 --> 2:49:19.840]  yeah, I mean the agenda is just rampant
[2:49:19.840 --> 2:49:21.840]  and that's what, you know, we gotta take it out of our language
[2:49:21.840 --> 2:49:23.840]  it's not a movement
[2:49:23.840 --> 2:49:27.840]  you know, most of the gay community is not in favor of what they're doing
[2:49:27.840 --> 2:49:30.840]  there's nothing to do with that, it's just, it's a power trip
[2:49:30.840 --> 2:49:31.840]  it's a power trip, you know
[2:49:31.840 --> 2:49:35.840]  teachers unions, post-Marxism, end of America
[2:49:35.840 --> 2:49:36.840]  okay, that's it
[2:49:36.840 --> 2:49:38.840]  and if they can form a sexual relationship with your child
[2:49:38.840 --> 2:49:41.840]  whether it's heterosexual or whatever, they've got control
[2:49:41.840 --> 2:49:43.840]  total control, I mean, think about that
[2:49:43.840 --> 2:49:44.840]  I mean, just one issue
[2:49:44.840 --> 2:49:46.840]  you turn that kid on one issue
[2:49:46.840 --> 2:49:48.840]  and it rackalizes them for all the rest
[2:49:48.840 --> 2:49:49.840]  I mean, think about that
[2:49:49.840 --> 2:49:51.840]  why would a gay person want higher taxes?
[2:49:51.840 --> 2:49:53.840]  why would a gay person want selective abortions
[2:49:53.840 --> 2:49:57.840]  which would inherently kill people who, you know, are allegedly born gay or whatever
[2:49:57.840 --> 2:50:00.840]  so, you know, this is just a dark thing
[2:50:00.840 --> 2:50:03.840]  so when we see the Democrat death march to November
[2:50:03.840 --> 2:50:06.840]  it is both about tempering the red wave
[2:50:06.840 --> 2:50:10.840]  which they know that they will do in cooperation with corporate forces and rhino forces
[2:50:10.840 --> 2:50:13.840]  they can afford to wait till August, folks, okay
[2:50:13.840 --> 2:50:17.840]  and don't forget, remember the Parkland shooting I think was in February
[2:50:17.840 --> 2:50:19.840]  and a reporter calls me and says, you know,
[2:50:19.840 --> 2:50:21.840]  don't you think your party needs to address this by November?
[2:50:21.840 --> 2:50:23.840]  I said, nobody will remember it by November
[2:50:23.840 --> 2:50:25.840]  and no one did, okay
[2:50:25.840 --> 2:50:28.840]  so think about this, everything we're talking about now
[2:50:28.840 --> 2:50:31.840]  is not what they have slated for us to talk about in the fall
[2:50:31.840 --> 2:50:34.840]  and Republicans never get this
[2:50:34.840 --> 2:50:37.840]  and they don't see the pre-programming getting ready for that event
[2:50:37.840 --> 2:50:40.840]  we can see it, it's terror attacks by patriots
[2:50:40.840 --> 2:50:43.840]  mass shootings, civil war stuff
[2:50:43.840 --> 2:50:47.840]  yeah, I mean, don't forget, you had Hunter Biden laptop cover-up
[2:50:47.840 --> 2:50:50.840]  so this was to take the negative
[2:50:50.840 --> 2:50:53.840]  and then the positive argument they were making was
[2:50:53.840 --> 2:50:56.840]  they're trying to kidnap the governor of Michigan
[2:50:56.840 --> 2:50:58.840]  who was almost the VP nominee
[2:50:58.840 --> 2:51:03.840]  I mean, secretly, folks, she was Biden's number one pick for VP
[2:51:03.840 --> 2:51:06.840]  it wasn't until Alex Soros and the Soros family interfered
[2:51:06.840 --> 2:51:10.840]  did they get Kamala Harris, but he wanted Whitmer, he wanted Klobuchar
[2:51:10.840 --> 2:51:13.840]  and he did not want Kamala on the top five
[2:51:13.840 --> 2:51:16.840]  so just think about this, in the positive
[2:51:16.840 --> 2:51:19.840]  they construct this argument, this is what we do in debate
[2:51:19.840 --> 2:51:22.840]  in the positive, their contention was
[2:51:22.840 --> 2:51:25.840]  they want to kidnap Whitmer, this is a mainstream Republican thought
[2:51:25.840 --> 2:51:28.840]  this is dangerous, you need to control it by throwing Trump out
[2:51:28.840 --> 2:51:30.840]  that's how you punish it
[2:51:30.840 --> 2:51:33.840]  and then over here in the negative
[2:51:33.840 --> 2:51:36.840]  they say, well Hunter Biden has nothing to do
[2:51:36.840 --> 2:51:39.840]  even though they spent all this time on Trump Jr, Eric and Ivanka
[2:51:39.840 --> 2:51:41.840]  maybe they should spend more time on Ivanka, honestly
[2:51:41.840 --> 2:51:43.840]  but you know, that's my personal
[2:51:43.840 --> 2:51:46.840]  so what do you think of the Democrats betting on January 6th
[2:51:46.840 --> 2:51:48.840]  because right now they're losing on that
[2:51:48.840 --> 2:51:50.840]  how do they gin that up?
[2:51:50.840 --> 2:51:53.840]  they're exiting politics, I mean they're exiting politics
[2:51:53.840 --> 2:51:55.840]  and they're entering war, you know what it was at that
[2:51:55.840 --> 2:51:59.840]  Prussian military theorist, you know, says that
[2:51:59.840 --> 2:52:04.840]  it was Bismarck, he said war is just the end of politics
[2:52:04.840 --> 2:52:07.840]  yeah, yeah, and politics is just the next level of politics
[2:52:07.840 --> 2:52:09.840]  when politics is failed
[2:52:09.840 --> 2:52:11.840]  pull up the Bismarck quote on war guys, it'll come up
[2:52:11.840 --> 2:52:14.840]  yeah, so people have to understand we're exiting politics
[2:52:14.840 --> 2:52:17.840]  we're entering philosophy or political theory
[2:52:17.840 --> 2:52:21.840]  and these hacks, these total hacks on Fox News, no offense
[2:52:21.840 --> 2:52:24.840]  they're not going to cut it, Karl Rowe's not going to cut it
[2:52:24.840 --> 2:52:26.840]  there's no way to vote yourself out of it
[2:52:26.840 --> 2:52:28.840]  politics are an extension of war by other means
[2:52:28.840 --> 2:52:32.840]  yeah, they've really translated it like 10 different ways from Sunday
[2:52:32.840 --> 2:52:35.840]  but essentially what people need to understand is that
[2:52:35.840 --> 2:52:40.840]  we're all fighting over goods, okay, economics
[2:52:40.840 --> 2:52:43.840]  and we usually do that through conquest
[2:52:43.840 --> 2:52:46.840]  and then when we choose to do that through trade
[2:52:46.840 --> 2:52:49.840]  a currency requires a government
[2:52:49.840 --> 2:52:52.840]  a government requires consent so that there's civil order
[2:52:52.840 --> 2:52:54.840]  and they've broken, they've broken
[2:52:54.840 --> 2:52:57.840]  Klaus Schwab admits we're breaking the social contract
[2:52:57.840 --> 2:52:59.840]  to build back better
[2:52:59.840 --> 2:53:01.840]  people need to know though he's not building back better
[2:53:01.840 --> 2:53:03.840]  he's not building back better
[2:53:03.840 --> 2:53:05.840]  building neo feudalism back better
[2:53:05.840 --> 2:53:08.840]  that's what they're doing, a techno neo feudalism
[2:53:08.840 --> 2:53:10.840]  and they say that
[2:53:10.840 --> 2:53:13.840]  war is nothing but a continuation of politics
[2:53:13.840 --> 2:53:16.840]  with the admixture of other means
[2:53:16.840 --> 2:53:19.840]  yeah, they really brought up the most confusing
[2:53:19.840 --> 2:53:23.840]  and that's an even older quote, that's the guy that trained George Washington's troops
[2:53:23.840 --> 2:53:27.840]  so what people have to realize is that we mean it when we say pray
[2:53:27.840 --> 2:53:29.840]  why? because we need God's intercession
[2:53:29.840 --> 2:53:31.840]  there has to be a change in our consciousness
[2:53:31.840 --> 2:53:34.840]  I'm not one of these New Age Christ consciousness folks or whatever
[2:53:34.840 --> 2:53:37.840]  no, but it's true, when we all change our consciousness and get it
[2:53:37.840 --> 2:53:38.840]  that's when we win
[2:53:38.840 --> 2:53:39.840]  yeah, and that's what we have to do
[2:53:39.840 --> 2:53:43.840]  and that's what Jesus did in contrast to the Pharisees and the Sadducees
[2:53:43.840 --> 2:53:47.840]  he said there's a different way to abide by the law
[2:53:47.840 --> 2:53:49.840]  and by the way now it's universal
[2:53:49.840 --> 2:53:52.840]  and so we need to have a different way of saying
[2:53:52.840 --> 2:53:55.840]  we believe in these archetypes and we believe in these traditions
[2:53:55.840 --> 2:53:58.840]  and you don't need to pay attention to the Republican label or the conservative label anymore
[2:53:58.840 --> 2:54:02.840]  these work for humanity, they've led to a population of 7 billion people
[2:54:02.840 --> 2:54:03.840]  and we should applaud that
[2:54:03.840 --> 2:54:05.840]  and we want to go to 10 billion
[2:54:05.840 --> 2:54:06.840]  we need to
[2:54:06.840 --> 2:54:08.840]  we want to go interstellar exactly
[2:54:08.840 --> 2:54:10.840]  so there's a move though to get rid of what works
[2:54:10.840 --> 2:54:13.840]  because the globalists have their new model they want to bring in transhumanism
[2:54:13.840 --> 2:54:15.840]  it's super weird because they're archaic
[2:54:15.840 --> 2:54:17.840]  they are everything they say of us
[2:54:17.840 --> 2:54:18.840]  they're the pagans
[2:54:18.840 --> 2:54:19.840]  they're the cavemen
[2:54:19.840 --> 2:54:21.840]  you know, we're the people who are dreaming
[2:54:21.840 --> 2:54:22.840]  loving and coming together
[2:54:22.840 --> 2:54:24.840]  they claim we're not
[2:54:24.840 --> 2:54:28.840]  you know, like let's not forget it was the church that added harmony to music
[2:54:28.840 --> 2:54:32.840]  it was the church that funded art that led to the Renaissance
[2:54:32.840 --> 2:54:36.840]  and so in a lot of ways we are always seeking on the right
[2:54:36.840 --> 2:54:40.840]  to commune with God in innovative ways that don't get rid of tradition
[2:54:40.840 --> 2:54:43.840]  that roots us at a civil society
[2:54:43.840 --> 2:54:46.840]  whereas they are the exact opposite
[2:54:46.840 --> 2:54:48.840]  they want brutalism, ugly stuff
[2:54:48.840 --> 2:54:50.840]  and they want to kill people and they want to...
[2:54:50.840 --> 2:54:55.840]  look at the media, all it sells is ugliness and death to get us to not recognize good from bad
[2:54:55.840 --> 2:54:57.840]  they're ugly, they're fat
[2:54:57.840 --> 2:54:59.840]  they require a lot of makeup
[2:54:59.840 --> 2:55:02.840]  you know, everybody now has a snapchat filter on zoom
[2:55:02.840 --> 2:55:04.840]  I mean, it's just, it's just crazy
[2:55:04.840 --> 2:55:06.840]  we've lost ourselves in this madness
[2:55:06.840 --> 2:55:10.840]  but because we've betrayed those values
[2:55:10.840 --> 2:55:12.840]  we Republicans, we conservatives
[2:55:12.840 --> 2:55:15.840]  so what do you predict for the midterms in 208 days?
[2:55:15.840 --> 2:55:17.840]  you know, I don't have any predictions
[2:55:17.840 --> 2:55:19.840]  I've never seen a midterm in my career
[2:55:19.840 --> 2:55:23.840]  where the opposition party is most certainly going to take power
[2:55:23.840 --> 2:55:25.840]  and the opposition leader Kevin McCarthy
[2:55:25.840 --> 2:55:28.840]  doesn't have a proposal, doesn't have promises
[2:55:28.840 --> 2:55:31.840]  and frankly, frankly, I'm going to just talk directly
[2:55:31.840 --> 2:55:35.840]  to Paul Gosar and the Freedom Caucus and Marjorie
[2:55:35.840 --> 2:55:39.840]  folks, you need to start getting Kevin McCarthy on the record
[2:55:39.840 --> 2:55:44.840]  with select committees and proposals that will get instant votes
[2:55:44.840 --> 2:55:47.840]  and he needs to cooperate with whipping those votes
[2:55:47.840 --> 2:55:49.840]  they're going to just like Trump three years ago
[2:55:49.840 --> 2:55:51.840]  when they had both the House and Senate
[2:55:51.840 --> 2:55:52.840]  they did nothing
[2:55:52.840 --> 2:55:54.840]  they did nothing and it was actually worse than nothing
[2:55:54.840 --> 2:55:57.840]  Mitch McConnell went to Trump privately
[2:55:57.840 --> 2:56:00.840]  and said, I want to focus on the tax cut
[2:56:00.840 --> 2:56:04.840]  Trump said, you've promised your party repeal
[2:56:04.840 --> 2:56:06.840]  okay, so I was on the repeal side of the argument
[2:56:06.840 --> 2:56:09.840]  I was having all these talks with the White House and stuff
[2:56:09.840 --> 2:56:12.840]  and so Mitch McConnell said, okay, I'll teach you a lesson
[2:56:12.840 --> 2:56:14.840]  so we did repeal
[2:56:14.840 --> 2:56:17.840]  and then, you know, John McCain does that famous thumbs down
[2:56:17.840 --> 2:56:19.840]  he coordinates that with Mitch McConnell
[2:56:19.840 --> 2:56:21.840]  Mitch McConnell then goes to Trump and says
[2:56:21.840 --> 2:56:23.840]  okay, I did my due diligence, Mr. President
[2:56:23.840 --> 2:56:24.840]  can we now do tax cuts?
[2:56:24.840 --> 2:56:27.840]  we do the tax cuts in such a way
[2:56:27.840 --> 2:56:31.840]  in which we lose our seats in New Jersey, Pennsylvania
[2:56:31.840 --> 2:56:34.840]  New York and California
[2:56:34.840 --> 2:56:35.840]  with how we decide
[2:56:35.840 --> 2:56:37.840]  by getting rid of the property tax exemption
[2:56:37.840 --> 2:56:40.840]  yeah, so, I mean, people, you know
[2:56:40.840 --> 2:56:42.840]  I'm not just something like weirdo
[2:56:42.840 --> 2:56:44.840]  they wrote it to turn everybody against Trump
[2:56:44.840 --> 2:56:48.840]  they did, and they wrote it so that we would lose the majority in 2018
[2:56:48.840 --> 2:56:50.840]  so, I mean, folks, they're setting it all up
[2:56:50.840 --> 2:56:52.840]  why would you get rid of a tax exemption?
[2:56:52.840 --> 2:56:53.840]  we want those
[2:56:53.840 --> 2:56:55.840]  yeah, we want those tax exemptions
[2:56:55.840 --> 2:56:57.840]  and we needed them
[2:56:57.840 --> 2:57:00.840]  we needed them because we don't run even in New Jersey
[2:57:00.840 --> 2:57:02.840]  again, it's New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania
[2:57:02.840 --> 2:57:04.840]  and then, well, mainly Los Angeles
[2:57:04.840 --> 2:57:07.840]  well, the left was scared because New Jersey and New York were going for Trump
[2:57:07.840 --> 2:57:11.840]  they tricked Trump to get rid of the property tax exemption
[2:57:11.840 --> 2:57:14.840]  yeah, yeah, and look, as a conservative, I say that's not fair
[2:57:14.840 --> 2:57:17.840]  but as somebody who wants to cobble together a majority
[2:57:17.840 --> 2:57:19.840]  I say we absolutely needed that
[2:57:19.840 --> 2:57:21.840]  so they knew damn well what they were doing
[2:57:21.840 --> 2:57:24.840]  and the architect out of that is the congressman who's out of Houston
[2:57:24.840 --> 2:57:27.840]  so, you know, it's, you know, Kevin Brady
[2:57:27.840 --> 2:57:29.840]  so, you know, it's just, it's a coup
[2:57:29.840 --> 2:57:31.840]  it's always a coup, it's an ongoing coup
[2:57:31.840 --> 2:57:34.840]  well, let's talk about how we counter it in the last five minutes
[2:57:34.840 --> 2:57:36.840]  and then Kate Daly takes over
[2:57:36.840 --> 2:57:38.840]  I'm Alex Shilson, FullWars.com
[2:57:38.840 --> 2:57:40.840]  Ali, how do people find you?
[2:57:40.840 --> 2:57:41.840]  Ali Alexander
[2:57:41.840 --> 2:58:10.840]  I'm Alex Shilson, FullWars.com
[2:58:11.840 --> 2:58:40.840]  I'm Alex Shilson, FullWars.com
[2:58:41.840 --> 2:58:43.840]  I'm Alex Shilson, FullWars.com
[2:58:43.840 --> 2:58:44.840]  I'm Alex Shilson, FullWars.com
[2:58:44.840 --> 2:59:12.840]  I'm Alex Shilson, FullWars.com
[2:59:12.840 --> 2:59:25.840]  I'm Alex Shilson, FullWars.com
[2:59:25.840 --> 2:59:34.840]  I'm Alex Shilson, FullWars.com
[2:59:34.840 --> 2:59:36.840]  I'm Alex Shilson, FullWars.com
[2:59:36.840 --> 2:59:42.120]  month. So the biggest sale in inforce history is going right now, the mega emergency blowout sale
[2:59:42.120 --> 2:59:46.600]  up to 75% off, get incredible products and keep inforces as strong as ever.
[2:59:48.520 --> 2:59:54.520]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:59:54.520 --> 3:00:12.920]  To the town of Alfre, who rode a stranger one fine day. Hardly spoke to folks around him didn't
[3:00:12.920 --> 3:00:19.960]  have too much to say. No one dared to say that. Well the white supremacist that reportedly attacked
[3:00:19.960 --> 3:00:26.280]  the subway yesterday. Frank James is in custody right now ladies and gentlemen. No he's actually
[3:00:26.280 --> 3:00:30.760]  black. But he's clearly mentally ill just like Dylan Roof. We don't blame white people for that.
[3:00:30.760 --> 3:00:34.600]  We don't blame black people for that. It's a real tragedy but I think with the temperature
[3:00:34.600 --> 3:00:39.480]  being turned up, we're going to see more of his insanity. There he is being brought
[3:00:39.480 --> 3:00:44.280]  into custody. Ollie and are enclosing the next five minutes. How do we avert the civil war they're
[3:00:44.280 --> 3:00:52.360]  trying to start? I keep saying this at the end of every segment. We absolutely need to pray.
[3:00:52.360 --> 3:00:58.120]  Why? Because it shows our priorities. Often times God's chosen people across several
[3:00:58.120 --> 3:01:04.200]  different covenants so the Christians are no different. We pray last and God wants us to pray
[3:01:04.200 --> 3:01:10.440]  first and prayer is the most powerful weapon and so when we use it last and then a miracle happens
[3:01:10.440 --> 3:01:14.120]  we're like well how did that happen? Well because we use the most powerful weapon last so I would
[3:01:14.120 --> 3:01:19.160]  tell people that I think we need to pray and I also think that we need a leader and I don't know
[3:01:19.160 --> 3:01:24.280]  who that is. Maybe it's you Alex. Maybe it's Donald Trump. Maybe it's General Flynn. But we need a
[3:01:24.280 --> 3:01:30.120]  leader that calls us to prayer and repentance because... Prayer needs to be first though.
[3:01:30.120 --> 3:01:35.400]  Yeah it needs to be first and you know this is something that I do like about like the Catholic
[3:01:35.400 --> 3:01:41.400]  Church and the Orthodox Church is that we have to acknowledge that there are sins that God does
[3:01:41.400 --> 3:01:46.120]  assign to a community. That doesn't mean we need to believe in collectivism but it means that we
[3:01:46.120 --> 3:01:51.160]  need to change our own lives. We need to make sacrifices. We need to abstain from certain things
[3:01:51.160 --> 3:01:55.560]  so that we leave room for a miracle and there's nothing wrong with saying okay well I've been
[3:01:55.560 --> 3:02:01.080]  going on this sin for a while and I've survived in times of prosperity but now that wickedness is
[3:02:01.080 --> 3:02:06.600]  across the land I need to abstain from that. God will you know admire your obedience. I don't want
[3:02:06.600 --> 3:02:11.000]  to admire reward your obedience. So first we need to pray. The second byproduct of prayer is that
[3:02:11.000 --> 3:02:16.920]  it makes us sane. So when we're getting this deluge of persecution we're not saying at our gut
[3:02:16.920 --> 3:02:22.280]  primal level we need to go bomb something. We need to go shoot something. It's I will not give them
[3:02:22.280 --> 3:02:26.760]  an inch and become the monster that they want us to become. Now folks I'm going to say something
[3:02:26.760 --> 3:02:31.160]  really crazy. I'm not going to deny it that people have the right of revolution. I'm not going to
[3:02:31.160 --> 3:02:36.760]  deny 1776 and I'm not going to deny that there is a time for legitimate violence when there is
[3:02:36.760 --> 3:02:42.520]  legitimate tyranny and by the way the Declaration of Independence even outlines that we should
[3:02:42.520 --> 3:02:46.920]  So you're right in duty. We're just but they are losing right now. We're winning politically.
[3:02:46.920 --> 3:02:50.360]  We don't want to do it yet but you're not denying we have the right. Right. I'm not
[3:02:50.360 --> 3:02:54.680]  denying. I'm saying it's not the time now. That's for sure. But it's definitely a card in our hand.
[3:02:54.680 --> 3:02:58.920]  We get we have we're allowed to play. Right. Right. It's like all else is lost. You got you
[3:02:58.920 --> 3:03:03.160]  got to do it. Yeah. If they start ripping your children from your home and we all know trees
[3:03:03.160 --> 3:03:07.960]  like you know there is a time for China to kill everybody's dogs and cats. Yeah. Isn't that crazy.
[3:03:07.960 --> 3:03:12.440]  So so what I was and everybody knows what that time is. The point is yeah anybody trying to lure
[3:03:12.440 --> 3:03:17.000]  you into plots to kidnap governors. Anybody want to offensively attack. That's not what we do.
[3:03:17.000 --> 3:03:24.040]  Right. And a discerning mind and a mind in prayer wouldn't frankly just would not punch cops at the
[3:03:24.040 --> 3:03:28.760]  Capitol would not kidnap governors would not do any. Well you'd know it makes us look bad.
[3:03:28.760 --> 3:03:33.080]  Like I mean it's obviously not good anyway. And you won't be successful. Like you know and this
[3:03:33.080 --> 3:03:39.160]  is how we know. I don't want to just randomly punch cops. It's dumb. It's very dumb. It's dumb.
[3:03:39.160 --> 3:03:44.040]  And this place has got I think so you know but you know I'll tell you these cops they need to stop
[3:03:44.040 --> 3:03:48.120]  complying with COVID orders and lockdowns and stealing. Yeah. No they're putting themselves
[3:03:48.120 --> 3:03:51.000]  in that position but doesn't mean we got to. Yeah. All right. You're gonna do the war room.
[3:03:51.000 --> 3:03:55.080]  Right. I'm going to do the war room I guess. I'm excited. Kate Daly is about to take over
[3:03:55.080 --> 3:04:01.240]  info wars dot com tomorrow's news today our big mega sale to 75% off selling stuff at cost.
[3:04:01.240 --> 3:04:05.160]  It ends today. The t-shirt sale at cost blow it all out. It's going to continue till they're all
[3:04:05.160 --> 3:04:11.080]  sold out info war store dot com or triple A two five three three one three nine.
[3:04:11.080 --> 3:04:14.680]  Ali what else are you going to be talking about in the war room today. Well I you know maybe I'll
[3:04:14.680 --> 3:04:18.280]  commiserate a little bit with Owen. I know that he's you know kind of tight lipped on his case.
[3:04:18.280 --> 3:04:22.120]  Everybody pray for Owen. Owen did nothing but peacefully outside the Capitol with me and they're
[3:04:22.120 --> 3:04:25.320]  trying to put him in jail. They're trying to use him as leverage against you and me and it's just
[3:04:25.320 --> 3:04:29.960]  really really sad. So you know we'll be talking about that and I guess more of this Fed plot.
[3:04:31.000 --> 3:04:34.920]  Which is you're like everybody's like we know we didn't detect the Capitol we're sick hearing it.
[3:04:34.920 --> 3:04:39.160]  They're betting everything on the midterms on this. What are they going to stage let's not be
[3:04:39.160 --> 3:04:46.440]  idiots. Obviously this is their big move to outlaw their opposition and 2024 and 2024 absolutely.
[3:04:46.440 --> 3:04:52.200]  All right Kate Dolly takes over. Thank you Ali Alexander. We'll be right back. Stay with us.

[3:06:01.800 --> 3:06:06.760]  Hi there I'm Kate Dolly your guest host. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show and thanks Alex.
[3:06:06.760 --> 3:06:12.120]  Good to be here with you and a lot a lot of news to cover. Man are we getting a barrage.
[3:06:12.120 --> 3:06:20.280]  I am marked safe today from the false flag madman Brooklyn attack.
[3:06:23.000 --> 3:06:28.520]  I also have so much to talk about with that and I also have Disney. I want to talk about Ukraine.
[3:06:28.520 --> 3:06:33.080]  I want to talk about who they're going to for the information on Ukraine very very important
[3:06:33.080 --> 3:06:38.920]  a little bit about the AP so much to talk about with you today but I'm so glad to be here. I'm
[3:06:38.920 --> 3:06:48.920]  from Kate Dolly radio dot com and let me just tell you I'm especially marked safe from the very very
[3:06:49.800 --> 3:06:56.600]  obvious attack. You know it's getting a little more obvious. I don't know whether it was the bag
[3:06:56.600 --> 3:07:06.600]  that was left at the scene with the BB gun pellets the hatchet the pepper spray extra smoke bombs.
[3:07:06.600 --> 3:07:12.680]  That was interesting. I thought that was interesting and then I thought it was really interesting
[3:07:12.680 --> 3:07:19.720]  because usually they don't leave that behind. But but the credit card falling out of the wallet
[3:07:20.360 --> 3:07:26.520]  supposedly on his ass though the one that fell out on the so that they knew who to go to it was
[3:07:26.520 --> 3:07:34.680]  just perfectly sandwiched between the Biden speech for ghost guns and then of course the rollout
[3:07:34.680 --> 3:07:42.760]  today of the TSA. Yeah the the total rollout they had already to go the TSA for subways.
[3:07:43.720 --> 3:07:48.840]  Yeah I'm going to talk about that gym that they've got. They got a lot that they already had kind of
[3:07:48.840 --> 3:07:54.520]  in the pocket kind of sounds familiar like going back to the Patriot Act but anyway they had this
[3:07:54.520 --> 3:08:02.760]  thing all ready to go and within 48 hours we're sitting on on what presumably after five years
[3:08:02.760 --> 3:08:08.520]  of not really having four years I'm sorry not really having anything like this they're going
[3:08:08.520 --> 3:08:14.760]  for this sort of event. That was so interesting to me and as I was watching the video within
[3:08:14.760 --> 3:08:22.920]  like two minutes I was just I don't know it was a it was surprising surprising it's like
[3:08:22.920 --> 3:08:32.760]  hat tip CIA you're you're really evil still but yet so obvious. Yeah anyway I was thinking about
[3:08:32.760 --> 3:08:37.880]  this and I was thinking about all the GoFundMe accounts that'll crop up now but and you know
[3:08:37.880 --> 3:08:42.920]  people people need to get paid but you really should demand that that we get different people
[3:08:42.920 --> 3:08:49.000]  involved. Maybe I don't know the whole situation was very interesting as I was watching this thing
[3:08:49.000 --> 3:08:57.560]  unfurl yesterday I was watching the I was watching the guy with the tourniquet that was very loosely
[3:08:58.440 --> 3:09:05.080]  from his jacket the arm of his jacket very loosely tied around his pant leg and I was
[3:09:05.080 --> 3:09:11.320]  looking at there was hardly anything under him but he was on his phone I would be on my phone
[3:09:11.320 --> 3:09:17.880]  I mean I you know instead of having this face I would I'd be on my phone I think that would be
[3:09:17.880 --> 3:09:25.000]  the best way to handle it and you know just to buy the time and then there were two guys that were
[3:09:25.000 --> 3:09:29.480]  hobbling around and couldn't decide which which leg I don't know it was kind of interesting it was
[3:09:29.480 --> 3:09:34.200]  like ooh this leg this leg I'm not sure I maybe I'll hobble and so there was that and they were
[3:09:34.200 --> 3:09:39.240]  walking in circles because I know when I'm scared I usually shoot for like the stairs or to get out
[3:09:39.240 --> 3:09:45.560]  of a scene but nobody was really getting out of the scene they were just walking in circles
[3:09:45.560 --> 3:09:52.520]  and then the cameras being off that was another one I mean so reminiscent of other things we've
[3:09:52.520 --> 3:09:58.680]  been involved in where the cameras just magically stopped working I it's very odd and and so all
[3:09:58.680 --> 3:10:06.760]  the people that were in frame stayed in frame milling around milling around and the the news
[3:10:06.760 --> 3:10:13.320]  yesterday said that people didn't have their shoes they were suddenly I I guess missing shoes they
[3:10:13.320 --> 3:10:18.520]  were missing shoes and clothes were torn although I didn't see that in any of the videos but but
[3:10:18.520 --> 3:10:23.640]  they said that they said that and then they also said that they were just super glad that he left
[3:10:23.640 --> 3:10:28.760]  behind this whole bag of stuff like the two canisters and the smoke grenades and all I know
[3:10:28.760 --> 3:10:38.760]  is that if I'm if I was a madman I would probably do a smoke grenade and then I would go onto a
[3:10:38.760 --> 3:10:44.280]  subway and then I would probably go after the people because I would want to create a scene of
[3:10:44.280 --> 3:10:52.920]  chaos because you know that's usually what they do madmen they usually will throw a smoke bomb
[3:10:52.920 --> 3:11:00.360]  first before they before they go after the people you know it's so it's so commonplace
[3:11:00.360 --> 3:11:09.240]  so I was reviewing this and I thought wow that's that's kind of crazy um that they would do that
[3:11:10.040 --> 3:11:14.440]  and then leave behind the credit card and then of course the bag and then the Glock but
[3:11:15.240 --> 3:11:20.760]  I thought wow and so it was so quick that the FBI was able to find them I mean my gosh it was like
[3:11:20.760 --> 3:11:26.680]  rapid speed they were able to find this guy and they were actually able to find out that of course
[3:11:26.680 --> 3:11:31.320]  because with the credit card we got to know why he did it who did it why he did it and so
[3:11:32.440 --> 3:11:40.040]  now we know that he is a that he thinks America is racist and that kind of fit perfectly into
[3:11:41.480 --> 3:11:46.120]  the narrative of what's going on today so that was that was just so coincidental if I was a
[3:11:46.120 --> 3:11:53.720]  coincidence theorist I'd be like all over this and then it was sandwiched so carefully between
[3:11:53.720 --> 3:12:02.040]  Biden's speech and between the the rollout today it was like within 48 hours that's quick
[3:12:03.000 --> 3:12:09.560]  usually it takes like a week but then the governor of New York was on camera saying um
[3:12:09.560 --> 3:12:15.720]  this has to end although we haven't had something like this for several years the whole time Trump
[3:12:15.720 --> 3:12:23.560]  was in office we didn't actually have anything like this sort of yeah anyway that was interesting too
[3:12:23.560 --> 3:12:29.400]  and so I kind of thought wow that was I all I know is that if I'm a coincidence theorist
[3:12:29.400 --> 3:12:35.640]  totally on board with this one and um realizing that oh my gosh this stuff just happens like the
[3:12:35.640 --> 3:12:40.120]  credit card falling out of of the wallet I thought that was good interesting I'm sorry
[3:12:40.120 --> 3:12:46.680]  interesting I thought that was interesting and uh and then of course um they said that they
[3:12:47.400 --> 3:12:52.440]  found that credit card and that they believed it to be the gunman but then they did know
[3:12:52.440 --> 3:12:59.080]  when he got off and on so that was I was like how did you know that if you didn't know who
[3:12:59.080 --> 3:13:06.360]  you were looking for but that was very interesting and um they said the motive was unknown but then
[3:13:06.360 --> 3:13:11.880]  24 hours later it's not unknown because we know exactly why I think when you arrest somebody you
[3:13:11.880 --> 3:13:17.400]  know exactly why they did what they did like pretty immediately when you're interviewing them they
[3:13:17.400 --> 3:13:25.480]  usually give up like in TV in TV you get the motive so quick so fast yeah um within an hour
[3:13:25.480 --> 3:13:29.240]  you know with the motive you know where they did it so it's kind of like TV you know why
[3:13:29.240 --> 3:13:34.680]  they did it when they did it and and so on so that was I thought interesting but I especially loved
[3:13:34.680 --> 3:13:39.560]  how quickly it happened after the Biden speech because I mean if you're gonna talk about ghost
[3:13:39.560 --> 3:13:46.280]  guns then you've got to have some sort of presentation happen something to shore that up
[3:13:46.280 --> 3:13:50.680]  otherwise it just seems sort of off-putting in the middle of the COVID and the Ukraine narrative
[3:13:50.680 --> 3:13:57.720]  and everything else I mean you've got to have something right there yeah you know that it helps
[3:13:57.720 --> 3:14:04.040]  I mean it helps does it not I think it helps um so I basically wanted to let you know that they
[3:14:04.040 --> 3:14:07.880]  are going to roll out or they have rolled out I guess they're just basically telling us now that
[3:14:07.880 --> 3:14:13.400]  they did roll it out that's the story they did roll it out got it they did roll it out and
[3:14:13.400 --> 3:14:19.720]  they're telling you that you don't have to go through a tsa check per se anymore they already
[3:14:19.720 --> 3:14:27.080]  have a system it's just already there it's already there you just you just walk through it and it
[3:14:27.080 --> 3:14:32.840]  picks up whether or not you have anything because it makes us safer and I like that I like safe and
[3:14:32.840 --> 3:14:38.440]  so um I feel safer I feel cuddly I just I always feel super safe with my government in control
[3:14:38.440 --> 3:14:43.720]  and so they are telling you now that they've rolled this out I guess there was a little slip
[3:14:43.720 --> 3:14:48.840]  of the tongue or there are rolling it out they've had it ready for years and that now when you board
[3:14:48.840 --> 3:14:56.840]  trains right to keep us safe they are going to be you're going to be walking through this apparatus
[3:14:56.840 --> 3:15:07.480]  for the tsa and nsa all right well I just uh I just really hope that the cia kind of ups their game
[3:15:07.480 --> 3:15:13.720]  I mean they're evil but they're obvious you got to give them that they're obvious about it and
[3:15:14.520 --> 3:15:18.200]  I don't know if they just think we're dumb I don't know I don't know if they just think
[3:15:18.200 --> 3:15:22.840]  they can just I think they stop trying I really do I think they just stop trying to do anything
[3:15:22.840 --> 3:15:27.560]  I was like well crisis actors are us and then you've got you know they they really do need
[3:15:27.560 --> 3:15:33.400]  up their game on just a little bit um I think it's getting a little more cool you know um for the
[3:15:33.400 --> 3:15:40.680]  for the theorist that is the you know coincidence theorist it's getting it's anyway I'm going to be

[3:20:20.760 --> 3:20:26.280]  about a lot of things in this hour i want to talk a little bit about uh a movie you may have watched
[3:20:26.280 --> 3:20:33.160]  about um about the topic of snakes a little bit and i'll comment on that in just a moment but i
[3:20:33.160 --> 3:20:40.200]  also wanted to mention just as we're talking about this today um the new york city uh mayor uh eric
[3:20:40.200 --> 3:20:46.120]  adams actually came out and and said they're rolling out their new technology and periodic bag checks
[3:20:46.120 --> 3:20:53.880]  for future terrorist attacks according to the mayor um he was on morning joe that lovely show
[3:20:53.880 --> 3:21:00.840]  on msnbc on wednesday with the previous day's terror attack on the city's uh subway system
[3:21:01.880 --> 3:21:07.240]  okay and the mayor touched on the possibility of all this new technology on public transportation
[3:21:08.280 --> 3:21:14.760]  although they already had it ready but he didn't really go into detail on that um he just said
[3:21:14.760 --> 3:21:19.960]  with the gun detection devices oftentimes when people hear metal detectors you know they immediately
[3:21:19.960 --> 3:21:25.640]  think of the airport model these are not the only models that are available these new models that are
[3:21:25.640 --> 3:21:33.480]  being used at ball games and parks and hospitals don't worry about it no biggie no biggie you're
[3:21:33.480 --> 3:21:39.880]  walking through tsa checkpoints wherever you go so don't worry about it it's not a big deal
[3:21:39.880 --> 3:21:47.080]  you're just he even said you're just simply walking through a device oh is that all okay so when i
[3:21:47.080 --> 3:21:51.880]  go to the hospital or my mini mart or the grocery store i'm just walking through a device that picks
[3:21:51.880 --> 3:21:57.960]  up on all my information and everything about me and looks under my clothes and that's i feel
[3:21:57.960 --> 3:22:04.200]  warm and fuzzy right now i feel fantastic just thinking about it and um not creepy at all but
[3:22:04.200 --> 3:22:09.240]  he just said don't worry about it we already got this covered and um they're going to be making
[3:22:09.240 --> 3:22:15.080]  sure that they you know take care of business in the future and they just wanted you to know
[3:22:15.640 --> 3:22:22.680]  so i feel i feel great um they also said you know no one is safe no one ever is safe um you're not
[3:22:22.680 --> 3:22:30.200]  safe from anything or anybody and um and so between covid between the maskwares by the by the way
[3:22:30.200 --> 3:22:39.480]  the 2022 maskwares seriously super citizen your work here is done you're good mankind has been
[3:22:39.480 --> 3:22:46.520]  saved from your extra efforts we appreciate you big heart emoji thank you big group hug um stop
[3:22:46.520 --> 3:22:53.800]  wearing them thank you uh philly masked up and we know this and um i don't know why i don't know if
[3:22:53.800 --> 3:22:59.320]  they lost all their brain cells in philly but certainly they must have because they are continuously
[3:22:59.320 --> 3:23:05.480]  wearing the mask voluntarily even cdc isn't even telling them to do it they're just doing it so
[3:23:05.480 --> 3:23:13.160]  i like that i mean i like the the over the the super citizen the the over exuberant citizen
[3:23:13.160 --> 3:23:21.480]  the one that just loves to wear it it's awesome anyway um and so we've got uh also the airports
[3:23:21.480 --> 3:23:26.440]  i wanted to mention that too the airports are going to be talking about you know they're obviously
[3:23:26.440 --> 3:23:31.320]  two more two more weeks slow the spread i don't remember the last time we heard that oh yeah
[3:23:31.320 --> 3:23:37.320]  that's right we've been hearing that for two years and so um so they just they want a couple more
[3:23:37.320 --> 3:23:42.680]  weeks i don't know what they have planned i know washington dc is getting covid it's completely
[3:23:42.680 --> 3:23:50.280]  targeted it's completely targeted to dc and um so everybody's falling ill with covid even though
[3:23:50.280 --> 3:23:55.480]  it's the sniffles but but they're falling ill with covid that's the that's the story and so the mask
[3:23:55.480 --> 3:24:04.600]  wearing is um you know preemptive preemptive and and by the way everybody has a collection so why
[3:24:04.600 --> 3:24:12.120]  not why not join in the fun um and so as we watch cities tumble into this crazy um in this crazy
[3:24:12.120 --> 3:24:16.440]  munchausen's by proxy by the government telling us we're ill and everyone's going i'm ill i must
[3:24:16.440 --> 3:24:22.440]  be ill i'm thinking i'm ill i'm gonna get ill any second um so this is the deal um if cities just
[3:24:22.440 --> 3:24:28.360]  refuse to wear it if they just refuse to wear it we could actually bypass all of this and i just
[3:24:28.360 --> 3:24:33.800]  think that would be outstanding don't you just some common sense and some logic and and throw away
[3:24:33.800 --> 3:24:40.440]  the little toxic shield on your face and and just stop wearing it there we go um all right so uh i
[3:24:40.440 --> 3:24:47.160]  wanted to talk a little bit about something that you may have seen uh out there and that is that you
[3:24:47.160 --> 3:24:53.960]  may have seen a video talking about snake venom and i think this is a very interesting theory
[3:24:53.960 --> 3:24:59.640]  i think there's a lot of well if you start to even google this topic you're going to find a
[3:24:59.640 --> 3:25:05.720]  lot of information on it and so when my husband was ill um i did notice that we had been at an
[3:25:05.720 --> 3:25:13.160]  event and um about six people in our small group at this event speaking engagement became very very
[3:25:13.160 --> 3:25:19.320]  ill on the way home and some of the sheriffs that were at this event that i was going to be interviewing
[3:25:19.320 --> 3:25:24.680]  after the event they happened to be ill too when i went to contact them and so i thought that that
[3:25:24.680 --> 3:25:31.320]  was kind of an interesting thing that my husband became violently ill on the way home from from
[3:25:31.320 --> 3:25:37.480]  this event and so that's when about a week later he ended up in the hospital um so and everybody
[3:25:37.480 --> 3:25:42.680]  knows that story i've gone over that story a couple times but what was interesting about it was many
[3:25:42.680 --> 3:25:50.200]  in our group um it certainly seemed strange that as we were all leaving the event um that so many
[3:25:50.200 --> 3:25:55.880]  in our group became violently ill so at that point i thought is this something that could be targeted
[3:25:55.880 --> 3:26:00.840]  but at the same time just to just to kind of tell you where i'm at on this i'm actually in the Dr
[3:26:00.840 --> 3:26:05.560]  david martin camp and the john rapaport camp that they have not a shred of evidence that
[3:26:05.560 --> 3:26:13.640]  covet even exists that it's more or less a label that says this is it's 98 symptoms with the 98th
[3:26:13.640 --> 3:26:19.560]  symptom being the fact that you don't know you have it so that's very convenient and very widespread
[3:26:19.560 --> 3:26:27.160]  to cover a whole host of things okay so when it's that wide and and everybody's car accident or
[3:26:27.160 --> 3:26:33.480]  you know cancer or uh everything that people die of is labeled as covet then you know you have a
[3:26:33.480 --> 3:26:40.120]  problem in society of a label disease okay a label it's just a label and so i'm in that camp
[3:26:40.680 --> 3:26:49.720]  but this would certainly this theory um of snake venom being very incidentally like the same exact
[3:26:49.720 --> 3:26:58.600]  symptoms of of say covet 19 and then also the fact that um that it attacks the body in the same way
[3:26:58.600 --> 3:27:05.000]  that's a really interesting thing so one of the theories is that this is in the water now i don't
[3:27:05.000 --> 3:27:10.920]  think globally you could pull that off but well i know brian dr brian artist has a has a video on
[3:27:10.920 --> 3:27:15.480]  this and he's been talking about this and i do think this is a very intriguing theory to think
[3:27:15.480 --> 3:27:22.440]  about but here in the united states where we obviously had more cases is this obviously
[3:27:22.440 --> 3:27:26.680]  and whether we were just pulling like crazy from all the other things that were going on
[3:27:26.680 --> 3:27:33.000]  um to label it covet or whether there you know was actually something going on well
[3:27:33.640 --> 3:27:39.480]  usa was different than the other countries so that leads me to believe that that possibly
[3:27:39.480 --> 3:27:45.560]  you know um could they do something to the water supply what would you test in the water and these
[3:27:45.560 --> 3:27:52.120]  will be some questions that will um will be asking a doctor artist in the future and talking
[3:27:52.120 --> 3:27:57.400]  about this because i do think what he has to say is pretty intriguing uh that there's an enzyme
[3:27:57.400 --> 3:28:01.400]  and that it's actually very important very beneficial critical for the immune system to
[3:28:01.400 --> 3:28:07.640]  function and that it makes sense why it'd be elevated in chronic illness um that the expression
[3:28:07.640 --> 3:28:15.320]  of this enzyme um when a patient starts to suffer a cytokine storm this is very much like how the
[3:28:15.320 --> 3:28:20.440]  venom would act in the body and so i know a lot of people are talking about this a lot of people
[3:28:20.440 --> 3:28:26.680]  have questions about this and uh and so we'll have to explore a little bit more into this and and
[3:28:26.680 --> 3:28:32.680]  talk about this because there are so many different theories on on COVID-19 but just like the gunman
[3:28:32.680 --> 3:28:39.080]  with the smoke bomb and then goes to shoot people like you know most gunmen do um what is the smoke
[3:28:39.080 --> 3:28:48.840]  bomb for COVID-19 what was the design of confusion around COVID-19 and what are the real underlining
[3:28:48.840 --> 3:28:53.960]  factors i'll be right back i'm k dally your guest host and you're listening to the alex jones show be

[3:32:04.200 --> 3:32:08.360]  simple little local radio show and i wanted to hire camera people i wanted to make films i wanted
[3:32:08.360 --> 3:32:13.720]  to really challenge the globalist and it was a t-shirt i designed the first one mass murderers
[3:32:13.720 --> 3:32:19.400]  agreed gun control works that helped us finance hiring the first two members of my crew that's

[3:33:04.200 --> 3:33:15.720]  welcome back i'm kate dallier guesthouse glad to be with you today i hope you're having a good
[3:33:15.720 --> 3:33:22.600]  day today um so i was mentioning the water i know this is a hot topic this week and i know that i
[3:33:22.600 --> 3:33:29.320]  was mentioning the water because could you do something to the water in our country probably
[3:33:29.320 --> 3:33:35.000]  i would imagine and um we'll have to we'll have to ask more questions about that um could you
[3:33:35.000 --> 3:33:41.320]  do something under the guise of say of say uh here we're here to clean the water with covet
[3:33:41.320 --> 3:33:47.960]  stuff uh this will this will help um you know because i i know that they had cleaning agents
[3:33:47.960 --> 3:33:53.480]  and all kinds of things um with the water supply and could those things actually be harmful that's
[3:33:53.480 --> 3:34:00.520]  a good question to ask for sure and i think the uh what's interesting about this whole case scenario
[3:34:01.160 --> 3:34:04.920]  that everyone's talking about i'm talking about watch the water it's a new documentary
[3:34:06.200 --> 3:34:12.440]  put out by a theory from a dr brian artist and i always appreciate people that will think and
[3:34:12.440 --> 3:34:18.200]  will really critically think about these types of things and so when i was thinking about this
[3:34:18.200 --> 3:34:26.280]  as well um you know there were a lot of articles about snake venom being used in studies and maderna
[3:34:26.280 --> 3:34:32.680]  especially use utilizing these things as well and so there are so many articles about it it's almost
[3:34:33.720 --> 3:34:38.440]  it's almost right there in plain sight for a long time which is kind of interesting okay
[3:34:38.440 --> 3:34:43.880]  so i take you take that piece in and you also uh think about remdesivir which i've talked been
[3:34:43.880 --> 3:34:50.200]  so vocal about obviously remdesivir it's like taking poison um it has a huge death rate and
[3:34:50.840 --> 3:34:55.160]  they have decided that it's the medicine with the high death rate we're going in and we're
[3:34:55.160 --> 3:35:01.080]  declaring it the medicine of the universe which is really sad and evil because we know the damage
[3:35:01.080 --> 3:35:08.440]  it can do but the damage is getting blamed on covid and not remdesivir well if i were you i would
[3:35:08.440 --> 3:35:14.120]  probably refuse remdesivir at all costs um and make sure that that stuff never touches your body
[3:35:14.680 --> 3:35:20.600]  um because it is it's kind of like a poison but remdesivir makes you bleed internally
[3:35:20.600 --> 3:35:26.760]  and then you don't clot exactly like king cobra venom does so that's very very interesting there
[3:35:26.760 --> 3:35:33.560]  was a study completed like venom coursing through the body um by rosemary brand and so there are
[3:35:33.560 --> 3:35:40.760]  similarities to things with covid that they are accusing covet of doing remdesivir of doing the
[3:35:40.760 --> 3:35:47.160]  shots of doing the drip system like we've been talking about with the shots that ruin your immune
[3:35:47.160 --> 3:35:54.600]  system right but instead of being a viral respiratory thing is this actually poisoning are we actually
[3:35:54.600 --> 3:36:00.360]  trying to survive poisoning it's a really interesting theory that's why i always appreciate
[3:36:00.360 --> 3:36:05.400]  people that will put out theories so that we can all take in the pieces think about these pieces
[3:36:05.400 --> 3:36:09.800]  and how they fit into our own lives what we've noticed all of you guys have noticed things right
[3:36:09.800 --> 3:36:14.760]  you've all noticed things i noticed the high death rate at the icu's i've marked myself safe from
[3:36:14.760 --> 3:36:23.160]  icu's today um and also i've noticed that we there can be a lot of a lot of different things
[3:36:23.160 --> 3:36:30.440]  that that could lead us in a lot of different directions that i get and maybe there are things
[3:36:30.440 --> 3:36:36.680]  hiding in plain sight that are the problem behind this maybe it is just a label like dr
[3:36:36.680 --> 3:36:42.760]  david martin says and john rapaport because there is no sequence of covet there's no sequence of
[3:36:42.760 --> 3:36:49.560]  covet so if you're really going to look at this are you going to say that maybe maybe that you
[3:36:49.560 --> 3:36:57.640]  label an illness and then and then while you're busy targeting certain groups certain events maybe
[3:36:57.640 --> 3:37:04.200]  certain things right certain target groups with something else besides what they're labeling
[3:37:04.200 --> 3:37:10.520]  as covet it could be very confusing like the guy with the smoke bomb right usually a madman
[3:37:10.520 --> 3:37:15.560]  with a um it wants to kill people isn't going to use a smoke bomb first why what would be the
[3:37:15.560 --> 3:37:20.360]  what why would you do that unless you just want to cause so much confusion that nobody knows what's
[3:37:20.360 --> 3:37:26.120]  happening and nobody can really identify who's really there okay so they do this with illness
[3:37:26.120 --> 3:37:31.800]  they do this with covet they do this with a lot of the narratives and false flags so as we're
[3:37:32.680 --> 3:37:38.760]  as we're going through the pieces of this i always keep in mind i'm always open to everything
[3:37:38.760 --> 3:37:43.560]  then you take in the pieces and you go okay what about this makes sense and what about this doesn't
[3:37:43.560 --> 3:37:50.360]  make sense how do i remedy all of this but i do think some of the pieces of this are kind of
[3:37:50.360 --> 3:37:57.640]  mind-blowing right hydroxychloroquine and uh all the things we've been told not to take the things
[3:37:57.640 --> 3:38:05.720]  we've been told not to take are really sort of the anti-venom aren't they to this they are the
[3:38:05.720 --> 3:38:12.440]  anti-venom and so that's very very interesting i hadn't really thought about snakes before all of
[3:38:12.440 --> 3:38:18.840]  this because it just wasn't on the radar at all was it for you i don't think i don't think it was
[3:38:18.840 --> 3:38:24.440]  for anyone and so to put these pieces together then go back and start googling this information
[3:38:24.440 --> 3:38:30.440]  and there's so much on it in the media that really it wasn't like they were shouting from the rooftops
[3:38:30.440 --> 3:38:35.320]  in the media they were more or less doing some articles about it i don't think people were
[3:38:35.320 --> 3:38:40.520]  thinking twice about it because everything we get right seems to come from some sort of
[3:38:40.520 --> 3:38:46.520]  animal coincidentally a bat a bird the bird flu you know everything's always coming from some
[3:38:46.520 --> 3:38:53.720]  obscure thing rather than naturally with with natural illness right it's always coming from
[3:38:53.720 --> 3:38:59.480]  some sort of animal which is really kind of strange because um well i could go into a whole
[3:38:59.480 --> 3:39:04.840]  thing about about all the different countries and and diseases or illnesses and bird flu
[3:39:04.840 --> 3:39:09.160]  specifically designated for certain countries which has never made sense i've talked a little bit
[3:39:09.160 --> 3:39:14.120]  about that on the show before um that that a that a disease would know to stay in the guidelines
[3:39:14.120 --> 3:39:21.080]  or the boundaries of a certain country doesn't make sense does it okay so putting these pieces
[3:39:21.080 --> 3:39:30.440]  together hydroxychloroquine venom all of these things um we know what works and we know about
[3:39:30.440 --> 3:39:35.240]  natural immunity so there's lots of questions about well then how does natural immunity work
[3:39:35.240 --> 3:39:42.040]  with this theory too and also i think people are um or could be very nervous about the water
[3:39:42.040 --> 3:39:49.880]  supply i don't put anything past the deep state ever i think these people are atheist i think
[3:39:49.880 --> 3:39:57.640]  they are hell bent on making sure that we aren't around or that we are the peasants of society
[3:39:57.640 --> 3:40:04.360]  so they have no regard for us and so that's why i'm very very open to and i probably
[3:40:04.360 --> 3:40:09.480]  not very surprised by anything they could pull off look at what they're doing with
[3:40:09.480 --> 3:40:14.680]  disney look at what they're doing with the youth you know look at what they're doing with
[3:40:14.680 --> 3:40:20.920]  child's rights and the right of a child to learn about sexuality well the most obvious thing about
[3:40:20.920 --> 3:40:26.680]  the whole disney situation and how they're changing our culture is why are teachers in florida hell
[3:40:26.680 --> 3:40:32.600]  bent and mad that they can't teach kindergartners about sexuality if they were just denying the
[3:40:32.600 --> 3:40:38.520]  fact that they were just doing it if they weren't doing it as they say they weren't doing that then
[3:40:38.520 --> 3:40:44.200]  why are they fighting for the right to do it see none of it makes sense and really what they're
[3:40:44.200 --> 3:40:52.280]  gaming for in this is to make it okay for children to have rights for children to have the ability
[3:40:52.280 --> 3:40:57.080]  to decide for themselves even though they're a child which basically cuts the parent out of it
[3:40:57.080 --> 3:41:04.600]  it and puts the government in and media in to be the parent so that way the child gets to do what
[3:41:04.600 --> 3:41:10.440]  the child wants when the child wants to you know what i'm saying so i just want to do a big whole
[3:41:10.440 --> 3:41:15.400]  shout out for my parents because my parents did not throw me on puberty blockers when i went through
[3:41:15.400 --> 3:41:22.680]  my tomboy stage thanks um so we have a whole society now that's saying well my kid thinks he's
[3:41:22.680 --> 3:41:27.320]  this and my kid thinks he's that so that's what they are and i'm going to allow them to be that so
[3:41:27.320 --> 3:41:32.280]  i'm the good parent pat myself on the back for being amazing today instead of being a parent
[3:41:32.280 --> 3:41:38.440]  that recognizes children have imaginations but what we're really doing behind that story
[3:41:38.440 --> 3:41:44.520]  and behind disney and the fallout with disney disney is going down the tubes fast uh disney
[3:41:44.520 --> 3:41:50.680]  saying we love the transgender community we love the lgbt community we're all about that and every
[3:41:50.680 --> 3:41:55.880]  show will have 50 percent of everything now from now on out we're really going to give your kids a
[3:41:55.880 --> 3:42:02.280]  sexual um sexual information and sexual identity problems and so the reason they're doing that
[3:42:02.280 --> 3:42:08.760]  though is to give children's rights right the children need their rights as a child to separate
[3:42:08.760 --> 3:42:14.600]  themselves away then from the parent who has control over them until they're 18 and responsibility
[3:42:14.600 --> 3:42:19.400]  for them and accountability that's really what they're after in doing the whole disney thing with
[3:42:19.400 --> 3:42:25.320]  florida and everything else and i'm glad that disantis is standing up for children to actual
[3:42:25.320 --> 3:42:33.480]  kids not being you know not being uh um indoctrinated into um questioning their sexuality
[3:42:33.480 --> 3:42:39.480]  in kindergarten can you even imagine we never had to go through this did we i i now i now look back
[3:42:39.480 --> 3:42:45.080]  on my years in the education system and thank you thank you for never having to discuss this 24 7
[3:42:45.080 --> 3:42:50.200]  right i'll be right back on the alex jones show i'm k deli your guest house from k deli radio
[3:42:50.200 --> 3:43:00.440]  dot com be right back it's about 25 years ago that i wanted to expand in for worse i've been
[3:43:00.440 --> 3:43:05.720]  on the air a couple years but i only had money to finance my own simple little local radio show
[3:43:05.720 --> 3:43:10.120]  i wanted to hire camera people i wanted to make films i wanted to really challenge the globalist
[3:43:10.120 --> 3:43:16.280]  and it was a t-shirt i designed the first one mass murderers agreed gun control works that helped us
[3:43:16.280 --> 3:43:20.760]  finance hiring the first two members of my crew that's our oldest design and we're still selling
[3:43:21.320 --> 3:43:26.360]  we have that design over a hundred others that will now all be limited editions because whatever
[3:43:26.360 --> 3:43:31.560]  stock we've got in that's that we're selling everything out to find the operation to get rid
[3:43:31.560 --> 3:43:35.560]  of inventory we'll still have some teachers in the future they'll just be limited editions and

[3:47:04.520 --> 3:47:16.520]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm kate dally your guest host and you can go to kate
[3:47:16.520 --> 3:47:22.440]  dally radio.com i do a live show every day and it's a it's a lot of fun and it's very interesting
[3:47:22.440 --> 3:47:28.440]  to be on this end of things and watching the news daily i mean i immersed myself probably i i know
[3:47:28.440 --> 3:47:35.880]  it's awful but 12 15 hours a day into this probably like alex does as well i mean this is
[3:47:35.880 --> 3:47:43.400]  something that we kind of swim in and so it's fun and interesting and excruciating at times and also
[3:47:43.400 --> 3:47:49.720]  it is um i have to say it's kind of mind blowing to go to the backstory of just about everything
[3:47:49.720 --> 3:47:55.560]  and kind of figure out why our country has what has happened to our country why are we here what
[3:47:55.560 --> 3:48:03.240]  is going on with us and with what we've allowed all this time in order to land in such a peculiar
[3:48:03.240 --> 3:48:13.640]  place where you could have a biden speech on guns a shooting within 24 hours and a tsa roll out for
[3:48:13.640 --> 3:48:18.760]  trains within another 24 hours i mean that's pretty crazy right it's like things are really speeding
[3:48:18.760 --> 3:48:23.960]  up and they might be speeding up a little bit because the democrats are afraid the republicans
[3:48:23.960 --> 3:48:28.600]  are going to take the house and the senate which they probably are but i don't know that it's going
[3:48:28.600 --> 3:48:33.880]  to do really much of anything because the republicans don't say a thing they don't say a thing about
[3:48:33.880 --> 3:48:38.760]  the election fraud they don't say a thing about uh well let me put it this way when the house and
[3:48:38.760 --> 3:48:44.440]  the senate and the president all had control we didn't do anything then anyway so what does it
[3:48:44.440 --> 3:48:49.800]  matter it's either a fast kill or a slow kill that's basically how i look at it and the parties are
[3:48:49.800 --> 3:48:56.840]  for us the parties are for us to sit and argue over while in washington it's just one big fat party
[3:48:56.840 --> 3:49:03.320]  so saying that i just wanted to go back to something that the ap put out on themselves
[3:49:04.040 --> 3:49:11.000]  which if you know me i have such disdain i as as much for the ap as i do the cia and the fbi
[3:49:11.720 --> 3:49:15.720]  and any intelligence group in america because they're screwing us over left and right
[3:49:15.720 --> 3:49:21.640]  but the ap came about in the mid 1800s and they actually put this out and so i just wanted to
[3:49:21.640 --> 3:49:28.120]  make sure everyone realizes again in the news cycle that we get we get our news from two sources
[3:49:28.120 --> 3:49:36.280]  the ap and Reuters okay both Rothschild owned both very very interesting entities and so from the
[3:49:36.280 --> 3:49:41.640]  beginning i just wanted you guys to know that the associated press is in charge of our elections
[3:49:41.640 --> 3:49:47.000]  and most people don't realize that even from the associated presses website the ap is the
[3:49:47.000 --> 3:49:52.760]  only organization that collects and verifies election results in every single city and county
[3:49:52.760 --> 3:49:58.600]  across the united states including races for the president the senate the house of representatives
[3:49:58.600 --> 3:50:05.560]  governors and statewide offices it's always the ap and if you're wondering about that why they
[3:50:05.560 --> 3:50:11.320]  never get mentioned in this because we all know they put out crap news the crap news goes as follows
[3:50:11.320 --> 3:50:17.480]  adjective adjective adjective piece of news adjective adjective and the reason they do this
[3:50:17.480 --> 3:50:22.280]  is because they want to frame the story it's kind of like how you know like like a lot of different
[3:50:22.280 --> 3:50:28.680]  tabloids write news they have to frame it like yesterday i was told that the dangerous madman
[3:50:28.680 --> 3:50:35.480]  monster blah i mean it's just it's amazing how they frame the news instead of just giving you the
[3:50:35.480 --> 3:50:42.600]  news well the explanation for why they are in charge of our elections is really quite interesting
[3:50:43.320 --> 3:50:46.840]  this was a piece that was written they said journalists have continued that tradition
[3:50:46.840 --> 3:50:55.640]  for the past 172 years so it shouldn't surprise anyone that uh that uh the ap has control over
[3:50:55.640 --> 3:51:03.560]  the elections why does it get to make the call why does the ap get to collect the information
[3:51:03.560 --> 3:51:11.160]  and predict the winner and make the call and the reasoning behind this was that uh well basically
[3:51:11.160 --> 3:51:22.280]  because they said no one ever stepped up to do it okay so the ap decided they they'd be the ones
[3:51:23.160 --> 3:51:28.040]  right there they'd be the ones to do it so the federal election commission which regulates some
[3:51:28.040 --> 3:51:35.000]  aspects of elections doesn't tabulate votes on a nationwide basis that responsibility has become
[3:51:35.000 --> 3:51:40.360]  one of the unofficial duties of the media i say it's the unofficial duty of the unofficial media
[3:51:40.920 --> 3:51:47.640]  how about that and so um as we kind of worship the ap or journalists do is the golden god of the
[3:51:47.640 --> 3:51:53.320]  media and as they spin out the national narrative that gets sent to all the teleprompters for all
[3:51:53.320 --> 3:51:59.640]  the nice teeth nice hair little robots that sit and give you your news those talented individuals
[3:52:00.360 --> 3:52:04.280]  as they give you your news at night what's interesting is all the scripts are the same
[3:52:04.280 --> 3:52:09.080]  right so we know this you can listen to your local broadcast and their taint of the story
[3:52:09.080 --> 3:52:15.400]  matches up with your national broadcast everything's the same nobody has no journalist has a different
[3:52:15.400 --> 3:52:22.440]  point of view or asked a question it's all the same and so the ap being in charge of our elections
[3:52:22.440 --> 3:52:29.560]  it's just no wonder when i look at how fraudulent they are that uh they were just a okay on making
[3:52:29.560 --> 3:52:34.280]  sure you got those results so fast remember when we all went to bed and all the numbers were changed
[3:52:34.280 --> 3:52:40.040]  like that um we all got the same those results in the morning and all of the media was on board
[3:52:40.040 --> 3:52:46.440]  with the results it's because the ap does that for you now the ap does it in one evening because
[3:52:46.440 --> 3:52:52.760]  they don't want you to have to wait they know that our society likes it and likes it fast so
[3:52:52.760 --> 3:52:58.520]  they're there to deliver and deliver the goods and so what they do is they call the election
[3:52:58.520 --> 3:53:04.440]  and when they call it basically people then step down right the opposing one that the loser steps
[3:53:04.440 --> 3:53:11.160]  down and says i guess i didn't win and so i i say this because when you're looking at the ukraine
[3:53:11.160 --> 3:53:17.080]  news the ukraine news is a is a whole different ball of wax because the ukraine well not a whole
[3:53:17.080 --> 3:53:22.600]  different ball of wax i shouldn't say it like that the ap news that covers okay and Reuters
[3:53:22.600 --> 3:53:29.880]  that cover the news in foreign lands are going to have all the same spin they're going to tell you
[3:53:29.880 --> 3:53:35.160]  exactly what's going down right and and what's happening and they're going to do it in a way
[3:53:35.160 --> 3:53:40.200]  that they have to teach you how to feel about it and when i was looking at cnn articles and fox
[3:53:40.200 --> 3:53:44.120]  news articles that are very this well they're very much the same they just have either a
[3:53:44.120 --> 3:53:49.640]  conservative spin in the adjectives or a liberal spin in the adjectives but it's interesting because
[3:53:49.640 --> 3:53:56.760]  they go to all the same people for comment they go to all the same people for comment and i i find
[3:53:56.760 --> 3:54:02.920]  that interesting because we don't really realize i think how coordinated the effort is until you
[3:54:02.920 --> 3:54:09.000]  really start to try you know really start to look well one of the gentlemen they go to is unicef's
[3:54:09.000 --> 3:54:15.640]  manual fontain it almost sounds like a made-up name but manual fontain and manual fontain from
[3:54:15.640 --> 3:54:21.640]  unicef has been talking about children and has been talking about everything that's diabolical
[3:54:21.640 --> 3:54:27.320]  in the news and they go to him for comment and he has the same exact kinds of comments we're all
[3:54:27.320 --> 3:54:35.720]  going to die they're all going to die um from ebola and that was back in 2014 from um afghanistan
[3:54:35.720 --> 3:54:44.120]  from um the uh nigerian crisis of 2016 um you name it he's got about the same types of comments
[3:54:44.120 --> 3:54:50.120]  and so it's always that millions of children are about to die or have food insecurity and they're
[3:54:50.120 --> 3:54:57.320]  about to starve and you we must go in and do something and but but but it's always the same
[3:54:57.320 --> 3:55:03.160]  it's always the same kind of line and so i find that kind of interesting and they go to the same
[3:55:03.160 --> 3:55:09.880]  people and one of them is the ambassador to the united nations um linda linda so trump fired her
[3:55:09.880 --> 3:55:17.720]  and then biden of course hired her back and uh and she is uh very interesting uh linda thomas
[3:55:17.720 --> 3:55:24.200]  greenfield she's very interesting and she's always the one commenting on ukraine and i thought that
[3:55:24.200 --> 3:55:29.000]  was kind of strange so they have the same kind of three people that they go to the other gentleman
[3:55:29.000 --> 3:55:37.480]  that they go to uh was uh inserted by us in 2014 and worked for zelensky and then of course uh got
[3:55:37.480 --> 3:55:42.120]  a medal at christmas time and when he got that medal at christmas time i think that's what kind
[3:55:42.120 --> 3:55:49.080]  of maybe got him on board to maybe be the spokesman for this ukrainian russian um a thing that's
[3:55:49.080 --> 3:55:53.480]  going on over there and so he is the spokesman for telling us what russia's doing and what they're
[3:55:53.480 --> 3:56:00.440]  not doing and the three of them are on comments for almost just about every single article you
[3:56:00.440 --> 3:56:05.880]  read so always know who you're looking at as far as the comments and the comments section and so
[3:56:05.880 --> 3:56:13.080]  forth the other thing that's cropped up is our legislators are our congress people confirming
[3:56:13.080 --> 3:56:21.160]  the events of ukraine so i'm hearing this over and over again liz cheney oh liz cheney so gross
[3:56:21.160 --> 3:56:28.120]  liz cheney um was confirming yet another event that happened in ukraine yesterday and i thought
[3:56:28.120 --> 3:56:34.680]  that's really strange why are the congress people doing this now is it because no one trusts the ap
[3:56:37.720 --> 3:56:44.360]  you shouldn't trust the ap because they're opinionizing news and so um and sometimes
[3:56:44.360 --> 3:56:52.040]  there's a grain of truth in there but it's usually it's there to propagandize to you and uh knowing
[3:56:52.040 --> 3:56:56.920]  that they control elections should tell you a lot about the ap and why we get sold the box of rocks
[3:56:56.920 --> 3:57:02.360]  that we do but why are congress people coming out and telling us about things that are going on in
[3:57:02.360 --> 3:57:07.480]  ukraine it's very interesting isn't it they're a world away but they seem to have all the knowledge
[3:57:07.480 --> 3:57:12.040]  in the world and all the goods on on what's going on and so i wanted to bring that to your
[3:57:12.040 --> 3:57:16.200]  attention because watch forward in the news i've been seeing this happen and it's been quite
[3:57:16.200 --> 3:57:23.400]  astounding and alarming those are my pronouns alarming astounded horrified those are my pronouns
[3:57:23.400 --> 3:57:30.280]  for today good gravy anyway all right uh thanks for listening in i hope you're having a great
[3:57:30.280 --> 3:57:36.440]  wednesday look look at it this way you've made it past the hump of the week so it can only be good
[3:57:36.440 --> 3:57:42.120]  from here on out right friday is a couple days away this is fantastic i'm kate daily i'm kate dally
[3:57:42.120 --> 3:57:47.320]  i even slaughtered my own name i'm kate dally i'm your guest host you're listening you ladies and
[3:57:47.320 --> 3:57:52.600]  gentlemen i need your help i need your help keeping info wars on the air and strong i need
[3:57:52.600 --> 3:57:58.520]  your help making sure that our mission continues on i was born for this you were born for this and
[3:57:58.520 --> 3:58:03.800]  people are really waking up right now but we had to build our own infrastructure because of the
[3:58:03.800 --> 3:58:09.400]  censorship and deplatforming that cost tens of millions of dollars and now with bandot video
[3:58:09.400 --> 3:58:14.920]  getting close to 10 million views a day we're a platform for thousands of independent journalists
[3:58:14.920 --> 3:58:21.640]  and groups to be able to post their content free of charge and because it's become so successful
[3:58:21.640 --> 3:58:28.600]  it's a catch 22 info wars and bandot video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human liberty
[3:58:28.600 --> 3:58:34.840]  movement worldwide but the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter hundreds
[3:58:34.840 --> 3:58:39.160]  and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month so the biggest sale in info wars history is going
[3:58:39.160 --> 3:58:44.440]  right now the mega emergency blowout sale up to 75 percent off getting incredible products and keep
[3:58:44.440 --> 3:58:51.320]  info wars as strong as ever the globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual
[3:58:51.320 --> 3:58:57.000]  warfare and with poisons and chemicals added to the food it's all come out and they're doing that
[3:58:57.000 --> 3:59:03.000]  not because we're weak but because we're made the image of god the creator and we are powerful and
[3:59:03.000 --> 3:59:08.680]  the social engineers fear that so much so that's why i repeat that famous internet saying that
[3:59:08.680 --> 3:59:16.520]  nobody knows who first came up with the boy is it true the propaganda would not be necessary
[3:59:16.520 --> 3:59:22.680]  if the situation was hopeless they need all the propaganda and all their lies and all their evil
[3:59:22.680 --> 3:59:29.720]  and all their cultural death because they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed
[3:59:29.720 --> 3:59:34.600]  on the god of this world who is a loser and that's why it's so important that everybody keep info
[3:59:34.600 --> 3:59:39.320]  wars in the air now more than ever because even you don't believe in god but the globalists are
[3:59:39.320 --> 3:59:44.680]  manifesting and setting up is safe and we are opposing the one world government and the mark
[3:59:44.680 --> 3:59:56.040]  of the beast they just announced if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
