[00:00.000 --> 00:11.920]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[00:11.920 --> 00:19.440]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[00:19.440 --> 00:34.800]  Alex Jones well ladies and gentlemen Abdul Rahman Al Al Harabi has visited
[00:34.800 --> 00:40.360]  the White House a whole bunch of times sometimes for many many many many hours
[00:40.360 --> 00:46.360]  you know he's the Saudi Arabian that it turned out was on the watch list and is
[00:46.360 --> 00:52.480]  connected to the royal family who was visited by the first lady and who is
[00:52.480 --> 00:57.780]  obviously being protected and that they're moving to deport but last week in
[00:57.780 --> 01:01.320]  fact guys I forgot to tell you before the show you queue up a drudge report
[01:01.320 --> 01:07.120]  where big sis says drudge report not credible and they're asked about this
[01:07.120 --> 01:11.800]  last what was this last Thursday and she says the drudge report is not credible
[01:11.800 --> 01:16.120]  no that is not going on and then of course Senator Cruz goes did you read the
[01:16.120 --> 01:20.680]  whole 300 plus page bill this that came out a few hours ago I did read it yes
[01:20.680 --> 01:26.880]  mm-hmm he's like oh you did and we've been very busy hmm it's just a total liar
[01:26.880 --> 01:31.680]  and they are acting so suspicious and I got to be honest with you if they're
[01:31.680 --> 01:36.960]  arrogant enough to have a Saudi who's got a bunch of his family on the Saudi
[01:36.960 --> 01:40.720]  terror watch list there's only 85 people on that list and six of them are his
[01:40.720 --> 01:45.600]  family and then the first lady visits him on all this I'm like is it really
[01:45.600 --> 01:50.200]  really it's that obvious you know because Glenn Beck's been all over this we
[01:50.200 --> 01:53.440]  were on it day one but just said okay he's a person of interest we don't know
[01:53.440 --> 01:58.920]  he should be looked at he should be looked at and they fished another Saudi
[01:58.920 --> 02:04.240]  out of the Boston River there so this is very suspicious what's going on but
[02:04.240 --> 02:08.440]  still I gotta hand it to Glenn Beck I mean just got to do it of course drudge
[02:08.440 --> 02:12.560]  report last Thursday or was it last Wednesday linked to our report about the
[02:12.560 --> 02:16.760]  Saudi that was first and then Beck did a piggyback on it and did get more intel
[02:16.760 --> 02:21.680]  than we had in fact he was the first to say he's visiting the White House and
[02:21.680 --> 02:25.920]  stuff I was like really and now it's confirmed we're going over that today I
[02:25.920 --> 02:34.240]  mean this is beyond a spy thriller and it gets worse Janet Reno lookalike
[02:34.240 --> 02:40.040]  excuse me big sis lookalike I'm sorry I shouldn't Mr. Matt out no no no no no
[02:40.040 --> 02:45.560]  Pat from Saturday Night Live okay that's that's wrong to do that Rachel Maddow
[02:45.560 --> 02:55.360]  Ms. Maddow Ms. Ms. Ms. Maddow Ms. Teleprompter went on a 14 minute
[02:55.360 --> 03:02.800]  tirade against myself and the drudgingator and others and and and says
[03:02.800 --> 03:07.200]  it's a conspiracy that first lady visited this guy when it's on record she
[03:07.200 --> 03:13.160]  did and you got the Saudi ambassador or the foreign ministry more powerful
[03:13.160 --> 03:17.320]  running around that night in emergency meetings with old bum bum with the
[03:17.320 --> 03:21.640]  putis by the way I saw on on YouTube people commenting going it's potis not
[03:21.640 --> 03:27.680]  putis that's a joke ladies and gentlemen I know it's not putis I mean I got to
[03:27.680 --> 03:31.360]  make a joke here when the media two days ago and they're still doing it
[03:31.360 --> 03:36.720]  worldwide saying Alex Jones influenced the bombers who by the way the one
[03:36.720 --> 03:41.400]  living who had his larynx cut out his vocal cords chopped on and he climbs out
[03:41.400 --> 03:45.120]  the boat and come on over here buddy you know get the scalpel ready maybe they
[03:45.120 --> 03:51.400]  should use a chainsaw on him like buzz saw from the running man but this is all
[03:51.400 --> 03:56.640]  falling apart like nothing I've ever seen and she gets up there and just says
[03:56.640 --> 04:00.480]  that it's all a conspiracy theory and then uses a clip out of context where I
[04:00.480 --> 04:04.080]  talk about a secret space program in thousands of dead astronauts to be
[04:04.080 --> 04:07.320]  technical I've talked to three different NASA guys one of them agreed to come on
[04:07.320 --> 04:11.800]  air who was in Air Force intelligence in Vietnam then was on the front line of
[04:11.800 --> 04:16.040]  the Houston program ran the cameras on the moon and then he choked up on air
[04:16.040 --> 04:20.040]  and wouldn't say at all I guess that national security conditioning I've been
[04:20.040 --> 04:23.400]  over to his house I've seen it all you know the big presidential awards he's
[04:23.400 --> 04:27.400]  got like that highest award you can get that's one of the guys two other guys
[04:27.400 --> 04:31.840]  confirmed it I've also talked I guess four guys one of them on October on record
[04:31.840 --> 04:35.920]  Dr. Bob Bowman former head of the Star Wars program and the point is when I
[04:35.920 --> 04:39.880]  said thousands I've talked to people that were in programs that they where they
[04:39.880 --> 04:44.920]  knew hundreds had died like 98% of the space program is secret they tell you
[04:44.920 --> 04:50.720]  90% as it's like 98 what you see is for show I mean hundreds of test pilots
[04:50.720 --> 04:57.080]  died and and what I've been told is they compartmentalized know of dozens per
[04:57.080 --> 05:02.080]  program and there's hundreds of programs with health threats on the rise
[05:02.080 --> 05:07.920]  such as West Nile virus MRSA CRE and now the new bird flu recently discovered in

[08:25.800 --> 08:32.040]  the street and every person he talked to but two women agreed that all guns
[08:32.040 --> 08:35.560]  should be confiscated and gun owners should be arrested in California they
[08:35.560 --> 08:39.320]  signed a petition to do that we had our crew out in California to interview
[08:39.320 --> 08:42.640]  professor griff of public enemy he was being inducted into the rock and roll
[08:42.640 --> 08:47.000]  hall of fame and some other people for an upcoming film I'll just tell you

[08:55.080 --> 09:00.520]  California over to Nazi Germany people signed a petition for that to go under
[09:00.520 --> 09:06.600]  Nazi rule and to get rid of the police force and confiscate the guns and we
[09:06.600 --> 09:10.480]  basically followed MSNBC script of it's for the earth for the children and the
[09:10.480 --> 09:15.440]  people did sign I'm not joking I'm not kidding and we're gonna premiere that it
[09:15.440 --> 09:18.240]  is not aired on the nightly news it is not airing we're gonna premiere that
[09:18.240 --> 09:23.160]  today here you have to understand this is the majority of Californians we did

[09:28.400 --> 09:33.080]  had brain injuries God bless their soul this was real people that could talk
[09:33.080 --> 09:37.480]  being told we're gonna put gun owners in camps we're gonna inject children with
[09:37.480 --> 09:41.760]  mercury we're gonna turn America over to Nazis and they signed petitions to do
[09:41.760 --> 09:47.480]  it now that is the and by the way we're gonna go even more outrageous here in
[09:47.480 --> 09:52.460]  Austin we've had people sign everyone in Austin signed to ban water for the
[09:52.460 --> 09:58.160]  earth and we're gonna go out and say execute children for the earth we're
[09:58.160 --> 10:02.360]  gonna say put children in microwaves for the earth and because if you do it in an

[10:16.080 --> 10:19.800]  joking you don't understand how evil these people are this is a cult of
[10:19.800 --> 10:26.720]  sickos if they hear something evil they they they're for it I mean remember
[10:26.720 --> 10:32.200]  what Bill Mars said a few months ago he said I want more death more abortion more
[10:32.200 --> 10:38.120]  killing more shootings but he wants your guns for the children of Sandy Hook see
[10:38.120 --> 10:42.940]  in a rare moment of she's he's think I'm joking this is not satire the
[10:42.940 --> 10:46.520]  Attorney General owns abortion clinics in America that do a partial birth
[10:46.520 --> 10:53.320]  abortion where they're shoving babies into toilets to drown these people are I
[10:53.320 --> 10:56.960]  mean look at the Nazis look at the Soviets look at the Romans look at the
[10:56.960 --> 11:01.920]  Aztecs when you let scum get control giant black pyramids get built in human
[11:01.920 --> 11:06.040]  sacrifice starts people ask what's at the bottom of the rabbit hole pyramids and
[11:06.040 --> 11:09.840]  human sacrifice I don't know why that's what's at the bottom of the rabbit hole
[11:09.840 --> 11:16.880]  that is history that is what goes on and yes it sounds crazy to people that
[11:16.880 --> 11:22.080]  haven't read history books but if you know reality if you know history you
[11:22.080 --> 11:25.560]  know what happens when we become subservient good people have to band
[11:25.560 --> 11:29.280]  together and say no to bullies and corrupt or the very worst of the corrupt
[11:29.280 --> 11:34.600]  will get in control and turn the world into a playground you know you think of
[11:34.600 --> 11:38.760]  being able to go to Tahiti for two weeks and and and skin dive and lay on the
[11:38.760 --> 11:45.400]  beach you know drinking rum rum and coax or you think of being able to go
[11:45.400 --> 11:49.280]  around and see horse races all over the world and whatever you're into or you
[11:49.280 --> 11:54.080]  think of being able to go and see the most beautiful art of the Louvre or or

[12:23.880 --> 12:27.200]  documented to be very historical one of the best history books out there

[12:31.160 --> 12:34.960]  Babylonian histories the Egyptian histories and the stuff the Bible says
[12:34.960 --> 12:41.400]  was in there wow keeps getting confirmed and every culture would demand by the

[16:41.760 --> 16:45.280]  actually listen to him and say let's get the army on the phone I'm like wow a
[16:45.280 --> 16:49.360]  happy ending but see in the real world if pod people landed folks and took over
[16:49.360 --> 16:53.920]  MSNBC they would say go to the local sports stadium where you will be given
[16:53.920 --> 16:58.960]  your pod they would go and do that that's how cult like these people are they
[16:58.960 --> 17:02.800]  will do anything I mean we we said we're gonna we're gonna have the Nazis
[17:02.800 --> 17:06.440]  take over and put people in camps and they know I'm sad but conservatives in

[17:26.360 --> 17:30.600]  watched MSNBC and CNN all they do is talk about how smart progressives are

[17:57.720 --> 18:01.520]  incredibly dangerous it is incredibly scary to have national media the old
[18:01.520 --> 18:05.760]  vestigial I have sort on coming after us even though it's weakened it still
[18:05.760 --> 18:11.960]  shows the power behind it is very evil and very weaponized it is confirmed that

[18:19.680 --> 18:24.200]  times one time if I read this correctly was there more than six hours what's

[19:32.440 --> 19:37.240]  anything there it's going on and he gets off and says hey I wasn't doing that
[19:37.240 --> 19:41.080]  it's like catching your kid with a hand in the cookie jar and they look at you
[19:41.080 --> 19:46.200]  and say I wasn't stealing cookies and she says no there's no watch list there's

[25:32.280 --> 25:36.320]  Syria that's right we a year ago saw Al Qaeda testing chemical weapons in in
[25:36.320 --> 25:41.640]  Syria saying we're gonna use it and the West is inserting Al Qaeda attacking a
[25:41.640 --> 25:45.080]  country's done nothing and now they're saying we've got to attack and bomb Syria
[25:45.080 --> 25:48.920]  because they've got chemical weapons and they're gonna use them and did use them
[25:48.920 --> 25:54.480]  and we said a year ago with Syrian girl whose family's anti Assad lives in
[25:54.480 --> 25:58.020]  Australia she's been on national TV net there we still call her Syrian girl
[25:58.020 --> 26:01.560]  even though I didn't he's now public and you know her family was part of the top
[26:01.560 --> 26:08.080]  government before that before Assad and she's a Sunni not a Shiite but she says
[26:08.080 --> 26:13.160]  Al Qaeda is evil and bad and everything she told us is true because she is jacked
[26:13.160 --> 26:18.560]  in directly to the real international Syrian community like I want Syrian girl
[26:18.560 --> 26:22.560]  back on tomorrow Ron Paul's on tomorrow but I want to get her back on just for
[26:22.560 --> 26:28.880]  15-20 minutes sometime tomorrow and you know I said I'd get to the other Madal
[26:28.880 --> 26:34.080]  thing I'm gonna do that next segment let me start getting into this now you saw
[26:34.080 --> 26:38.440]  last was Thursday a big sis got asked you know like for six seven minutes I'm
[26:38.440 --> 26:41.880]  gonna play just a few minutes up at the full clips online just type in big sis
[26:41.880 --> 26:44.440]  says drugs not credible and then we're brought up hey these Saudi Arabians
[26:44.440 --> 26:47.840]  reportedly on the no-fly list they were taken off that list he's being
[26:47.840 --> 26:52.640]  deported next week we have the deportation order he was reportedly visited
[26:52.640 --> 26:55.840]  the you know all this stuff she's like that is not credible that is not
[26:55.840 --> 26:59.480]  credible there is the Poletano drudge report is not credible wash an
[26:59.480 --> 27:06.320]  examiner and then this week it all came out info wars calm suspected Saudi
[27:06.320 --> 27:12.840]  terrorist al-harabi visited White House numerous times and sometimes
[27:12.840 --> 27:17.640]  sometimes spent most of the day there or the night there I mean this is like
[27:17.640 --> 27:21.840]  incredible what was going on I mean I mean what were you doing planning some
[27:21.840 --> 27:27.720]  mission impossible thing I mean this is incredible and and all of this has now
[27:27.720 --> 27:32.880]  come out and she's been caught lying about it and info wars calm was the
[27:32.880 --> 27:37.800]  article drudge linked to and then the blaze as well and now they're saying well
[27:37.800 --> 27:40.720]  it must be photoshopped even though it doesn't look photoshopped even though
[27:40.720 --> 27:44.280]  she was in town at the time going to visit the skies that why high-level
[27:44.280 --> 27:47.480]  ambassadors went to visit him is that why the fire minister went visit the
[27:47.480 --> 27:51.240]  White House that night is that why this guy's been to the White House is that
[27:51.240 --> 27:55.360]  why he's jacked into the royal family is that why he was on the terrorist no
[27:55.360 --> 28:01.840]  fly list watch list let's go ahead and go to big sissy here it is I will tell
[28:01.840 --> 28:08.280]  you we found it so inherently unbelievable that those statements would
[28:08.280 --> 28:13.600]  be made it was hard to ascribe credibility to them and I don't know if I
[28:13.600 --> 28:20.240]  would put Forbes and drudge in the same sentence but I let me be as clear as I
[28:20.240 --> 28:24.160]  can be drudge out of it I wouldn't I think they're credible but Forbes is
[28:24.160 --> 28:28.240]  definitely a credible magazine and when they use that number and then we hear
[28:28.240 --> 28:32.720]  silence from the department and Americans see the ammo shelves empty you
[28:32.720 --> 28:36.960]  know all that feeds that well like I said it got into the blogosphere and it
[28:36.960 --> 28:40.960]  went viral we understand that and and as I was with senator Johnson let me be as
[28:40.960 --> 28:44.800]  clear as I can be and again that's enough that that particular clip that
[28:44.800 --> 28:49.840]  particular clips about the ammo thing cuz separately they were discrediting that
[28:49.840 --> 28:53.000]  but if you go watch the full clip it's also about Saudi Arabians and those
[28:53.000 --> 28:58.680]  stories by the way I keep seeing online Alex Jones got caught in the ammo hoax
[28:58.680 --> 29:03.880]  it's now two billion two hundred million plus bullets in the last year and a
[29:03.880 --> 29:10.880]  half armored vehicles it's all real and they think you're so stupid they get up
[29:10.880 --> 29:14.840]  there and say none of this is real ladies and gentlemen homeland security has
[29:14.840 --> 29:18.120]  taken delivery in the last year and a half of a billion rounds and they've got
[29:18.120 --> 29:22.560]  a billion two hundred million on order that they can't even get delivered so
[29:22.560 --> 29:27.480]  so they're buying so much that all these factories for two years out now can't
[29:27.480 --> 29:31.080]  sell to anybody else and as soon as they expand capacity they double down and
[29:31.080 --> 29:34.760]  buy even more to try to dry up ammo is ammo beings right up right now in the
[29:34.760 --> 29:42.160]  calibers they're buying yes you can't get it 9 millimeter 40 caliber 308 223 all
[29:42.160 --> 29:46.040]  the things the federales use the global oddies they're not even feds or

[34:12.880 --> 34:16.600]  federal government are trying to mop up resistance around the country but that is
[34:16.600 --> 34:20.200]  what it is and they go to Davos they go to Bilderberg they they go to the
[34:20.200 --> 34:24.160]  Financial Times of London and they just write articles admitting how they've
[34:24.160 --> 34:27.280]  conquered us and how they're authoritarian and how we're too stupid to
[34:27.280 --> 34:32.480]  even resist them I mean they plant the flag they they mark us like a dog marks
[34:32.480 --> 34:36.320]  of fire hydra and man I don't like it in my face I mean I'm just telling you
[34:36.320 --> 34:42.760]  right now and Manow and others think you are complete morons document cam please
[34:42.760 --> 34:48.960]  I'm going to go to the document cam here in a moment but let me just recap some
[34:48.960 --> 34:53.320]  of what's going on here okay you got Michelle Obama clearly in town at the
[34:53.320 --> 34:57.640]  time and clearly visiting the Saudi who they're acting suspicious about and
[34:57.640 --> 35:03.520]  wanted to deport and had on a no fly list and but who's who's simultaneously
[35:03.520 --> 35:08.600]  constantly visiting the White House and here's that story from the right scoop
[35:08.600 --> 35:13.240]  you know right to the White House dot gov and this is a federal law Patriots
[35:13.240 --> 35:17.200]  got in decades ago that we know who comes to the White House but said they'll do
[35:17.200 --> 35:21.160]  these walkbys where somebody just oh we accidentally let you in we don't let
[35:21.160 --> 35:23.760]  tourists even take photos of the building even though we're supposed to
[35:23.760 --> 35:29.360]  a free country but that's okay though we'll have the secret service follow
[35:29.360 --> 35:31.720]  media around that they're trying to even get shots of the White House that's
[35:31.720 --> 35:35.560]  happened to us and I've seen it happen to mainstream media as well but oh you
[35:35.560 --> 35:39.440]  we're just gonna have a walk by where the Saudi Foreign Minister just magically
[35:39.440 --> 35:43.120]  shows up the night of the bombing and you've got the no fly list and you've
[35:43.120 --> 35:47.080]  got the cover up and you've got the guy right where the bomb goes off and you've
[35:47.080 --> 35:52.480]  got him connected with six of his family on the terror list in Saudi Arabia when
[35:52.480 --> 36:00.040]  there's only 85 people that's been reported and you look at how long Al
[36:00.040 --> 36:06.040]  Harabi this guy was there I mean sometimes he's there more than six
[36:06.040 --> 36:09.920]  hours I don't know what's going on I mean maybe maybe he's just you know
[36:09.920 --> 36:12.880]  playing ping-pong with the president or basketball or something so there's
[36:12.880 --> 36:16.360]  nothing to see here move along immediately just just don't look at
[36:16.360 --> 36:24.160]  that meanwhile let's then shift gears into the other the other news that I
[36:24.160 --> 36:29.720]  have here we talked about this yesterday it was in a local news in Georgia with
[36:29.720 --> 36:35.400]  the senator spoke out and since then it's been confirmed since Senator
[36:35.400 --> 36:40.480]  Chambliss went public US had more tips on Boston suspect Congress is asking
[36:40.480 --> 36:44.360]  questions that'll be ie whitewash because they know the American pit first
[36:44.360 --> 36:48.120]  it's don't answer questions don't ask questions there is nothing going on
[36:48.120 --> 36:53.360]  going on it's a conspiracy theory there was no drill there was no bomb squad
[36:53.360 --> 36:57.840]  there weren't it's got to be 50 people in black backpacks that all act like
[36:57.840 --> 37:02.680]  they're part of a drill you have special forces types national guard plain
[37:02.680 --> 37:07.040]  clothes we know there was a bomb drill that's the Boston Globe reported it
[37:07.040 --> 37:11.440]  that day then they said oh no we didn't then we have the photos of the video they
[37:11.440 --> 37:17.000]  did why are they hiding that you know why why are they at the press conference
[37:17.000 --> 37:21.520]  with Secret Service in Obama's detail when he's not even nearby in front of
[37:21.520 --> 37:25.160]  our guys saying don't hold those photos up and the FBI says no one go look at
[37:25.160 --> 37:29.600]  this guy's photos on national TV whatever you do don't look at him and who
[37:29.600 --> 37:37.400]  is it it's Al Harabi Haribi it's all these other foreigners with backpacks it's
[37:37.400 --> 37:41.400]  the contractors with backpacks and the FBI's like do not look at that do not
[37:41.400 --> 37:45.080]  look at that even though the day before they had the arrest it was gonna be a
[37:45.080 --> 37:48.240]  right winger he was at the courthouse they had to evacuate that I guess well
[37:48.240 --> 37:51.520]  they probably got rid of that person they're probably wearing lead lead shoes
[37:51.520 --> 37:54.520]  right now our bowling balls tied to him probably find them like the other dead
[37:54.520 --> 37:58.800]  Saudi Arabian out in the lake the point is and I predicted that I mean this is
[37:58.800 --> 38:03.160]  all this is a hardcore operation and now it's come out confirmed the
[38:03.160 --> 38:06.160]  documents have been released by the Georgian and Russian media and our
[38:06.160 --> 38:13.880]  White House is his mom on it this guy was part of the CIA Tamerling he was part
[38:13.880 --> 38:20.960]  of a Jamestown group as it's called run by who calls for putting radical Muslims
[38:20.960 --> 38:25.640]  up against the Russians and radicalizing the Islamic Crescent as they call it
[38:25.640 --> 38:31.720]  under Russia in the stands from Georgia to Dagestan a repeat of the thing they
[38:31.720 --> 38:39.440]  did in Afghanistan in 79 to the 80s with the Mujahideen Al Qaeda Zabignu
[38:39.440 --> 38:44.480]  Brzezinski ladies and gentlemen Zabignu Brzezinski oh but let's continue here I
[38:44.480 --> 38:48.360]  thought there was no prior knowledge I thought they didn't know US had more
[38:48.360 --> 38:52.040]  tips that's Reuters but did nothing oh of course they did nothing
[38:52.040 --> 38:55.840]  congressman 5 g hottest have reached their targets in the United States under
[38:55.840 --> 38:58.880]  Barack Obama yeah he's putting the jihad he's all over the world in charge
[38:58.880 --> 39:04.320]  you two US agencies added Boston bombs suspect to watch list they do that as a
[39:04.320 --> 39:08.400]  cover kind of like the CIA Al Qaeda guys that we've pointed out on the news and
[39:08.400 --> 39:11.080]  the FBI will do an arrest when they come back to the US but then release them
[39:11.080 --> 39:16.160]  that's to cover their bases when the guy later gets set up because I've seen this
[39:16.160 --> 39:19.720]  over and over again again you have an agent who you tell be part of a drill
[39:19.720 --> 39:23.960]  and he's going around the mosque to find radicals saying let's blow up and kill
[39:23.960 --> 39:28.480]  you know kill Americans that then creates the ledger and the history to say
[39:28.480 --> 39:32.120]  he's a real terrorist they did that with McVeigh who was special forces let's
[39:32.120 --> 39:36.840]  continue here two US agencies added Boston bombs suspect to watch list the
[39:36.840 --> 39:40.560]  picture emerging was of counterterrorism bureaucracy that had at least four
[39:40.560 --> 39:45.360]  contacts oh the mother said it was five years everything she said was confirmed
[39:45.360 --> 39:50.000]  the Russians blew his cover with Russian spy services asking about the
[39:50.000 --> 39:54.560]  brothers in the year before he took a six-month trip to Russia in 2012 to
[39:54.560 --> 40:00.240]  Dagestan and other areas Chechnya but never found reason to investigate him
[40:00.240 --> 40:05.680]  further well yet cuz he was CIA after the CIA cleared him of any ties to violent
[40:05.680 --> 40:10.640]  extremism in October 2011 why because what did we say last Friday would come
[40:10.640 --> 40:15.980]  out Boston bomber role in CIA and Chechen terror we broke it not hard to
[40:15.980 --> 40:21.520]  break that's the follow it's a handbook the criminals are pathological the
[40:21.520 --> 40:24.920]  globalist are criminals their pathological their obsessive compulsive
[40:24.920 --> 40:32.160]  Islamic terror from caucuses next phase of plan to undermine our liberty I'm not
[40:32.160 --> 40:35.640]  saying all obsessive compulsive or terrorist I'm saying in criminology a
[40:35.640 --> 40:39.040]  lot of your smarter high-level psychopaths are also obsessive compulsive
[40:39.040 --> 40:42.440]  obsessive compulsive tends to be associated with higher intelligence
[40:42.440 --> 40:47.200]  just like in breeds of dogs that have higher IQs higher aptitude they tend to
[40:47.200 --> 40:51.040]  be more obsessive compulsive it's just it's it's at least you can be obsessive
[40:51.040 --> 40:54.600]  compulsive the average jellyfish can't obsess on anything they have no focus
[40:54.600 --> 41:00.320]  anyways let's continue here Boston bombers role of CIA in Chechen terror
[41:00.320 --> 41:07.040]  Islamic terror from caucuses next phase of plan to undermine our liberty that is
[41:07.040 --> 41:14.720]  April 19th listing Brzezinski in here Kurt Nemo oh yesterday Kurt Nemo
[41:14.720 --> 41:21.920]  Tamerlin attended CIA sponsored workshop he was radicalized by CIA on record a
[41:21.920 --> 41:26.680]  group run by the CIA sponsoring him they're driving Mercedes they've got
[41:26.680 --> 41:30.520]  tons of cash he's going around like a playboy you see all those CIA recruitment
[41:30.520 --> 41:34.920]  ads be part of the CIA on TV that's why they're so freaked out Rachel Mad on
[41:34.920 --> 41:38.360]  everybody are just she looks like she her house is burning down when she
[41:38.360 --> 41:41.360]  attacks me because they know they have no viewers they know all they have is
[41:41.360 --> 41:45.480]  jellyfish watching their idiots they know we have the initiative and we are
[41:45.480 --> 41:51.240]  blowing them to hell in the info war we are wrecking them I mean this is what
[41:51.240 --> 41:56.200]  life is all about savaging scum in the info war overrunning I'm not listening
[41:56.200 --> 42:01.040]  to their propaganda using the truth to absolutely smash them into a pile of
[42:01.040 --> 42:06.440]  wreckage and just to be committed to this and fearless it's just such a
[42:06.440 --> 42:11.880]  blessing thank you God let's continue here we will defend the Republic scum
[42:11.880 --> 42:18.440]  Tamerlin attended CIA workshop boom mainline Russian news Georgian news top
[42:18.440 --> 42:22.240]  Georgian generals have released the documents there's part of a CIA non
[42:22.240 --> 42:27.520]  governmental organization boom UM coach bomb sniffing dogs spotters on route
[42:27.520 --> 42:30.560]  before explosions told them it's part of a drill don't worry cuz everybody's like
[42:30.560 --> 42:40.280]  why are there all these bags and what's the motive trillions in the next decade
[42:40.280 --> 42:45.680]  in domestic drones spy operations data mining per year 10 billion dollar
[42:45.680 --> 42:51.160]  contracts to congressmen wives companies I mean just pale mail corruption making
[42:51.160 --> 42:55.440]  every American a suspect papers please army on the street smoke screening all
[42:55.440 --> 42:59.040]  the corruption Wall Street stealing 85 billion a month pumping an offshore
[42:59.040 --> 43:04.480]  that's your motive it's a clash of civilizations they radicalize every
[43:04.480 --> 43:08.280]  Muslim group let them wreck other countries so they can't be industrialized
[43:08.280 --> 43:13.920]  to gen 21 the New World Order you and oh MSNBC attacks me and says Alex Jones
[43:13.920 --> 43:18.040]  in an article Obama head of al Qaeda worldwide who is the titular head of
[43:18.040 --> 43:22.960]  the Pentagon who is the head the main guy in NATO who is ordering billions of
[43:22.960 --> 43:29.240]  dollars to be given to al Qaeda in Libya and Syria to take over countries who is
[43:29.240 --> 43:34.080]  the head of NATO who is the most powerful executive with power over that
[43:34.080 --> 43:38.520]  it's a Barack Obama even though he's a puppet I mean he is the head of al Qaeda
[43:38.520 --> 43:43.800]  see how that's hiding in plain view and I got to give my rights up I gotta let
[43:43.800 --> 43:49.520]  weirdos grab my wife's crotch to fly because of al Qaeda when you people run
[43:49.520 --> 43:53.440]  them and then you call it a conspiracy theory you stupid witch we're gonna play
[43:53.440 --> 43:58.040]  this clip but the one thing she criticizes me on that I will say has
[43:58.040 --> 44:03.360]  some validity here is they found one clip of where I said thousands of
[44:03.360 --> 44:07.700]  astronauts have died in secret space program what I was told by multiple
[44:07.700 --> 44:13.600]  NASA people off record but to on record Bob Bowman was the former head of
[44:13.600 --> 44:17.640]  Star Wars program he said by the late 70s they had a fleet of space planes
[44:17.640 --> 44:20.520]  with DU Sabos in them and he's the only reason you could say that was they
[44:20.520 --> 44:25.120]  accidentally leaked it in a debate on C-span he said he you know it's super
[44:25.120 --> 44:30.400]  national that was in this late 70s they admit over 90% of the space program
[44:30.400 --> 44:35.760]  secret tried 98 99% okay and I'm not gonna get into it I you know I'm from
[44:35.760 --> 44:39.680]  Texas folks I know a lot of people I grew up around NASA stuff I know people
[44:39.680 --> 44:43.680]  that were involved in NASA programs as children that have been high level in
[44:43.680 --> 44:53.160]  Microsoft and I'm just gonna I mean high level key men okay key and the point is
[44:53.160 --> 44:56.880]  there is a giant program we don't know about and it's compartmentalized
[44:56.880 --> 45:00.480]  underground bases you name it hundreds guys look up the number of US test
[45:00.480 --> 45:05.920]  pilots known to have died well I think it's in the hundreds imagine the secret
[45:05.920 --> 45:08.920]  space program so what I was told programs that different people and
[45:08.920 --> 45:12.560]  Bowman didn't get into this you got the space planes what I was told and the guy
[45:12.560 --> 45:15.600]  said he'd come on air he came on air and choked up and didn't do it it's Raymond
[45:15.600 --> 45:19.640]  Teague Raymond said there were a lot of people dying and that there's reportedly
[45:19.640 --> 45:24.000]  Russians Chinese dead on the moon as well there's a reason the point is they
[45:24.000 --> 45:28.760]  did go to the moon they just don't show you all the real stuff and also fake some
[45:28.760 --> 45:33.640]  stuff for PR purposes but the point is others told me oh it's true massive
[45:33.640 --> 45:36.840]  death rates people couldn't handle astronauts getting barbecued on launch
[45:36.840 --> 45:43.720]  pads they've had space planes going into space since the 60s and the and what I
[45:43.720 --> 45:47.640]  was told that program killed hundreds I mean these were guys that you know
[45:47.640 --> 45:51.200]  beyond Chuck Yeager or Chuck Yeager knows about all this that were I can't
[45:51.200 --> 45:54.000]  always say beyond Chuck Yeager but that type of guy just like I'm ready to do
[45:54.000 --> 45:57.200]  it I volunteer on suicide missions because they didn't have computers that
[45:57.200 --> 46:01.240]  could control it or even you know guided stuff that good then suicide missions in
[46:01.240 --> 46:04.680]  the early to the late 60s I have to skip this network break this is too
[46:04.680 --> 46:10.720]  important to to test alloys and composites to get these space planes into
[46:10.720 --> 46:16.560]  orbit and a lot of men died so the globalists can now have robots do it but
[46:16.560 --> 46:20.240]  it was humans that did it and it was humans and the word was hundreds died
[46:20.240 --> 46:23.240]  in that program so I extrapolated out they said I don't know about the other
[46:23.240 --> 46:28.240]  programs if hundreds died in space plane programs in 60s so that by the 70s they
[46:28.240 --> 46:35.040]  could put robots in orbit then what do you think's going on I don't know if
[46:35.040 --> 46:42.000]  thousands died okay but I extrapolated that if one program I should dozens try
[46:42.000 --> 46:47.360]  up hundreds yeah you know hundreds I mean there was something like between 4
[46:47.360 --> 46:53.040]  and 10,000 nobody knows troops that died in secret war in Vietnam from 59 to 64
[46:53.040 --> 46:57.160]  before they stage Gulf of Tonkin and that wasn't declassified till about 10
[46:57.160 --> 47:01.920]  years ago that they said little over 4,000 some numbers are higher now now
[47:01.920 --> 47:05.800]  I'm going to play the Rachel Maddow and pause and talk over here and again
[47:05.800 --> 47:09.040]  stations shouldn't play over this next break as it's a network break I do this
[47:09.040 --> 47:11.400]  more and more I don't even plug my own sponsors here on there because I'm so
[47:11.400 --> 47:15.520]  obsessed with with just getting the word out but this is them in damage
[47:15.520 --> 47:19.240]  control if you can't see the video as a radio listener go to info wars.com
[47:19.240 --> 47:25.280]  because she is in panic mode look look you've lost the confidence of the
[47:25.280 --> 47:30.520]  people and there's no going back okay you understand that Mano you've got an
[47:30.520 --> 47:33.440]  America you're you've you've you've wrecked this financially you've got

[47:41.840 --> 47:47.200]  not going to go on forever because some of us aren't cowards and that's why I
[47:47.200 --> 47:51.320]  say I admire drudge because drudge gets it and drudge knows this there's
[47:51.320 --> 47:54.320]  evidence to all this and so he's willing to be attacked notice Janet
[47:54.320 --> 47:59.560]  Apolitano didn't say he's not on a no fly list or you know he's not a listed
[47:59.560 --> 48:03.800]  as a potential terrorist he just said that is incredible source but then of
[48:03.800 --> 48:09.080]  course it all turned out it was true and what was drudge linking to info wars.com
[48:09.080 --> 48:13.480]  see they're mad folks because all the other media will sell out all the other
[48:13.480 --> 48:18.200]  media will play ball but no one's watching you anymore you're a shadow of
[48:18.200 --> 48:23.000]  your former self look at you and yeah you get to be on a power trip with your
[48:23.000 --> 48:27.440]  eugenics and your your death cult and you know you know I just want more death

[48:45.640 --> 48:52.080]  ourselves against you okay so this is a game of chicken folks and and and you
[48:52.080 --> 48:58.000]  have to defeat these people you have to fully commit I mean drudge knows the
[48:58.000 --> 49:02.600]  old systems gone you people have no power anymore sure you got the guns and
[49:02.600 --> 49:06.840]  the feds but you don't have the moral authority anymore you're a joke you
[49:06.840 --> 49:11.800]  witch let's go ahead and go to this is part of the 15 minute clip or whatever
[49:11.800 --> 49:15.720]  it is but this is where she really gets into badandi how dare him ask a
[49:15.720 --> 49:20.440]  question about a drill when the drill is on record now but she thinks her
[49:20.440 --> 49:24.600]  audience are morons here it is crazy conspiracy theories are also trying to
[49:24.600 --> 49:28.960]  sell the idea that the Boston Marathon bombing did not happen or if the Boston
[49:28.960 --> 49:33.680]  Marathon bombing did happen it was done by the government it's an elaborate
[49:33.680 --> 49:37.200]  hoax to make us believe that we were attacked when really we weren't attacked
[49:37.200 --> 49:40.480]  it was our government doing it to us it's all part of the way that government
[49:40.480 --> 49:44.560]  controls us or something to be clear I'm not talking about family members of the
[49:44.560 --> 49:47.880]  bombing suspect saying we believe our family members are innocent that's a
[49:47.880 --> 49:50.840]  whole different thing what I'm talking about is full-blown American
[49:50.840 --> 49:55.720]  conspiracy theories that the US government itself bombed the Boston
[49:55.720 --> 49:58.040]  Marathon
[49:58.040 --> 50:00.040]  if you take any questions
[50:00.040 --> 50:03.000]  oh sir why do we want to speak to strong people from the other stuff
[50:03.000 --> 50:07.160]  be calm the moments before the bomb went off is this another false flight stage attack
[50:07.160 --> 50:09.640]  to take out civil liberties and promote homelessness security
[50:09.640 --> 50:11.640]  I was taking a hand down on the streets
[50:11.640 --> 50:13.640]  no next question
[50:13.640 --> 50:16.640]  why was people being told to try and I'm ready to my own mind
[50:16.640 --> 50:20.560]  by the way they did start sticking hands down the pants and papers please and
[50:20.560 --> 50:23.440]  they're welcome to a family to look nothing like the suspects go get me let
[50:23.440 --> 50:26.080]  me just see your ID have the army pointing guns at them
[50:26.080 --> 50:30.880]  oh so I'm a conspiracy theorist because that happened and you did use it to
[50:30.880 --> 50:34.560]  basically have martial law and now say everybody loves martial law this will
[50:34.560 --> 50:38.440]  be the new way of life show the front page of info wars.com Anthony

[50:42.240 --> 50:46.120]  can show you the real papers please type in papers please info wars.com
[50:46.120 --> 50:50.360]  by the way they're on the news right now just openly saying they're going to
[50:50.360 --> 50:54.280]  attack Syria now because they have WMDs and use chemical weapons why not I mean
[50:54.280 --> 50:57.400]  they'll probably get on the news and say that Assad launched the attacks in
[50:57.400 --> 51:02.440]  Boston why not they'll probably say Assad is Al Qaeda when he's fighting Al
[51:02.440 --> 51:05.960]  Qaeda because they think you're idiots but the difference is the American
[51:05.960 --> 51:09.080]  people are not complete idiots and they're starting to find out let's go
[51:09.080 --> 51:12.760]  back to the one that sits up on her high horse and she'll tell you what's real
[51:12.760 --> 51:16.280]  she'll tell you what's going on and she's so mad too that you support us
[51:16.280 --> 51:19.840]  with $5.95 a month to subscribe to see the films and stuff though most of the
[51:19.840 --> 51:24.240]  stuff's free you know she gets banker bailout money MSNBC does you know she's
[51:24.240 --> 51:27.360]  government and globalist funded she's so mad that you've still got enough money
[51:27.360 --> 51:31.720]  to support free media she gets into that too she absolutely hates it here it is
[51:31.720 --> 51:54.400]  that was day one of the Boston Marathon bombings the very first question put to
[51:54.400 --> 51:57.240]  law enforcement and government officials when they held their press
[51:57.240 --> 52:00.200]  conference to explain to people what was going on the very first question was
[52:00.200 --> 52:03.600]  somebody alleging that the government had bombed the marathon it was a false
[52:03.600 --> 52:07.720]  flag attack and it was not just that one time that that happened this kept
[52:07.720 --> 52:18.680]  happening at the press briefings next question please next question please yes
[52:18.680 --> 52:26.760]  yes by the way while this is happening Secret Service are in his face pushing
[52:26.760 --> 52:30.920]  him and yelling at him and telling him you know don't show people the photos of
[52:30.920 --> 52:36.960]  all the Saudi Arabian and others it's like out of a movie and Matt I was
[52:36.960 --> 52:40.600]  panicking what if other slaves go to press conferences what if other slaves
[52:40.600 --> 52:44.560]  ask questions by the way they're now getting ready to start bombing Syria a
[52:44.560 --> 52:48.720]  poor country so then turned over to Al Qaeda to slaughter the ancient Christian
[52:48.720 --> 52:52.280]  and Jewish communities there and the Muslim minority communities it's such a
[52:52.280 --> 52:57.000]  war crime and they got that weirdo black-op commander haggle up there like a
[52:57.000 --> 53:04.480]  shark with his shark eyes just lying to people no liars oh Syria's got WMD's and
[53:04.480 --> 53:08.760]  you watch when they're done when they're done they're gonna say Syria was
[53:08.760 --> 53:12.400]  behind the bombing and I'll be a traitor because I don't want to put Al Qaeda in
[53:12.400 --> 53:19.840]  charge let's go back to mr. Maddow yes yes why are you denying there was bomb
[53:19.840 --> 53:23.720]  drills bomb drills you conspiracy theorists claiming that there was not
[53:23.720 --> 53:28.320]  really a Boston bombing that it was the government blowing us up on purpose so

[53:49.360 --> 53:51.960]  of it saying the government cook the bomb train the driver and then let it go
[53:51.960 --> 53:54.840]  forward even though the informants tried to stop it and said don't bomb those
[53:54.840 --> 54:01.120]  people I mean you stupid witch not all of us are scum like peacock narcissists
[54:01.120 --> 54:05.560]  that that sell out to evil so you can be somebody up there on your little

[54:15.360 --> 54:19.960]  man behind the curtain for what it is a stinking lie let's go back to her this
[54:19.960 --> 54:24.240]  is not a freelance thing these guys are mostly associated with a popular
[54:24.240 --> 54:28.480]  conspiracy theory talk show called info wars the host of the show is a man named
[54:28.480 --> 54:32.840]  Alex Jones yesterday afternoon Matt drudge who's the purveyor of the most
[54:32.840 --> 54:36.480]  influential conservative website in the country the drudge report yesterday
[54:36.480 --> 54:41.280]  afternoon Matt drudge tweeted this he tweeted I privately told friends that
[54:41.280 --> 54:47.120]  this will be the year of Alex Jones one hell of a broadcast in such a homogenized
[54:47.120 --> 54:51.680]  media again this is from the most influential figure in conservative media
[54:51.680 --> 54:57.080]  who is not named Roger Ailes at Fox News Channel and this is the guy he's now
[54:57.080 --> 55:03.680]  endorsing saying it's this guy's year the government lies out of hand you're
[55:03.680 --> 55:06.040]  saying well then why do you believe in the moon landing because I have sources
[55:06.040 --> 55:12.040]  inside NASA they put on some fake stuff for you see there was a lie see it's not
[55:12.040 --> 55:16.240]  just did we go or didn't we go you were shown the tinker toy stuff because you're
[55:16.240 --> 55:18.680]  not supposed to see what they really got you're not supposed to know the
[55:18.680 --> 55:23.440]  thousands of astronauts that have died oh yes I should do a whole show on that
[55:23.440 --> 55:27.640]  effect this is the kind of stuff we get you killed the night of the Boston
[55:27.640 --> 55:32.360]  Marathon bombing that same conspiracy theorist guy said quote our hearts go
[55:32.360 --> 55:37.000]  out to those that are hurt or killed Boston Marathon but this thing stinks to
[55:37.000 --> 55:43.400]  high heaven false flag and by false flag he means a cloak and dagger super
[55:43.400 --> 55:47.600]  extra double top secret black ops operation that the government carries
[55:47.600 --> 55:50.840]  out in such a way as to make it look like the operation was done by somebody
[55:50.840 --> 55:57.120]  else he means the US government bombed Boston so our own government could make
[55:57.120 --> 56:02.880]  it look like we were under attack at a time ladies and gentlemen you need to
[56:02.880 --> 56:07.920]  go to info wars calm and you need to read the articles that Paul Watson and
[56:07.920 --> 56:11.880]  curtain emo put out dealing with the fact of why you should always look at
[56:11.880 --> 56:16.600]  government as the number one suspect why government should be the first
[56:16.600 --> 56:20.240]  suspect in a terror attack and it's the whole history of it a brief history of
[56:20.240 --> 56:24.520]  false flag terror attacks or why governments love state sponsored terror
[56:24.520 --> 56:28.680]  everybody should send this to MSNBC to all of their employees most of her
[56:28.680 --> 56:34.280]  compartmentalized by the way it's come out that seeing it in other groups like
[56:34.280 --> 56:39.040]  MSNBC have CIA there actually writing and loading the teleprompter don't
[56:39.040 --> 56:43.120]  believe it even came out the watch composed and world that daily 2000 and
[56:43.120 --> 56:47.440]  she's just hope she don't look that up I mean Madel is more like a foundation
[56:47.440 --> 56:51.600]  person which is above the CIA I mean she's here to break it all down she's a
[56:51.600 --> 56:56.840]  technocrat she knows the whole ballgame folks she signed on to it it's
[56:56.840 --> 57:00.600]  because she hates life she just just she just she just loves evil I mean you
[57:00.600 --> 57:04.920]  just look at her hey you know what you robot you witch you're not gonna win and
[57:04.920 --> 57:09.120]  by the way it's come out that Tamerlin was working under the CIA it's come out
[57:09.120 --> 57:12.160]  there was five contacts and the Russians blew their cover and even went to the
[57:12.160 --> 57:19.440]  CIA and said keep your guy out of here trying to blow stuff up and see his he
[57:19.440 --> 57:23.200]  was blown and he didn't know that's when they started getting ready to set up
[57:23.200 --> 57:26.760]  Tamerlin then he's got his brother to tag along because now he was a
[57:26.760 --> 57:30.000]  compromised asset and they flush you down the toilet and everybody should
[57:30.000 --> 57:33.680]  remember who works for this new world order you are totally and completely
[57:33.680 --> 57:39.000]  expendable you are a biological android drone to them and when they're done with
[57:39.000 --> 57:42.720]  military they are gonna take your guns that's why they shoot you up with
[57:42.720 --> 57:47.760]  time-lapse time-delayed vaccines to kill you down the road if you want to
[57:47.760 --> 57:51.680]  support the broadcast which he absolutely hates she gets into that maybe

[1:00:13.320 --> 1:00:22.240]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[1:00:22.240 --> 1:00:27.800]  Rachel Maddow is attacking us and saying that the right wing has taken the
[1:00:27.800 --> 1:00:31.360]  gloves off no the right wing hasn't taken their gloves off the American
[1:00:31.360 --> 1:00:34.760]  people are getting past left right and getting back to the Bill of Rights of
[1:00:34.760 --> 1:00:39.160]  Constitution the left's pushing tyranny the right's pushing tyranny but Obama is
[1:00:39.160 --> 1:00:44.720]  trying to quote radically transform America into a bankrupt domesticated
[1:00:44.720 --> 1:00:49.160]  collectivized society run by a bunch of offshore banks that are tax exempt
[1:00:49.160 --> 1:00:52.440]  they're butchering the entire Bill of Rights and Constitution right now we're
[1:00:52.440 --> 1:00:56.160]  getting Gerald Salente on right now he's going to be on for the rest of the
[1:00:56.160 --> 1:01:00.240]  hour coming up and I promise I will open the phones up so you can take a
[1:01:00.240 --> 1:01:05.280]  few Gerald can take a few of your questions on any issue you want to raise
[1:01:05.280 --> 1:01:10.920]  so we'll get about that number coming up in the next segment but the big news is
[1:01:10.920 --> 1:01:18.800]  Hagel I mean we told you over a year ago that they were going to false flag and
[1:01:18.800 --> 1:01:23.200]  blame Syria for a chemical attack now Syria would never do that because that
[1:01:23.200 --> 1:01:27.200]  would then allow an attack on them and then Syria came out and said Al Qaeda is
[1:01:27.200 --> 1:01:31.600]  preparing to launch chemical weapons on us and Al Qaeda put out videos showing
[1:01:31.600 --> 1:01:36.160]  themselves nerve-gassing a dog bragging how they would do it to menace the
[1:01:36.160 --> 1:01:40.560]  Syrians see they think Americans are so dumb they let Al Qaeda publicly menace
[1:01:40.560 --> 1:01:45.120]  and scare the Syrian people and and military hoping they do something I
[1:01:45.120 --> 1:01:48.520]  mean you would never use a chemical weapon an asymmetrical warfare where
[1:01:48.520 --> 1:01:50.800]  you don't know where the terrorists are that turns everybody against you you
[1:01:50.800 --> 1:01:55.680]  would never do that it's like saying Assad's gonna barbecue you know Sunni
[1:01:55.680 --> 1:02:03.040]  children on the on his lawn and this is a proxy war this is a proxy war and
[1:02:03.040 --> 1:02:07.240]  again Assad's his own thing dictator family trying to democratize the country
[1:02:07.240 --> 1:02:11.240]  a lot better than his dad probably ten times better this is that this is a war
[1:02:11.240 --> 1:02:15.720]  crime going on over there and this has been going on now for I don't know 25
[1:02:15.720 --> 1:02:19.280]  months 26 months and I want to get against Syria girl back on because
[1:02:19.280 --> 1:02:22.560]  everything she said has come through and then a few months ago they they said
[1:02:22.560 --> 1:02:26.160]  oh chemical chemical was used chemical was used chemical was used you've got
[1:02:26.160 --> 1:02:31.080]  Turkey attacking with NATO you've got Israel helping you've got Qatar you've
[1:02:31.080 --> 1:02:37.960]  got Saudi Arabia the main group sending in real Al Qaeda to take down the really
[1:02:37.960 --> 1:02:43.760]  secular government and just involved in incredible war crimes torturing murder
[1:02:43.760 --> 1:02:46.960]  and Christians chopping their heads off but it's never on our news even though
[1:02:46.960 --> 1:02:49.640]  well it is in the New York Times a few months ago remember six months ago or
[1:02:49.640 --> 1:02:53.320]  so was like man look at the great fighters yeah they're out of Saudi Arabia
[1:02:53.320 --> 1:02:57.160]  they're kind of jihadis but man they really are fighting evil Assad tell the
[1:02:57.160 --> 1:03:01.080]  first year of the attack they would say peaceful demonstrators killed by the
[1:03:01.080 --> 1:03:05.440]  meaning government when Al Qaeda had tanks and airplanes they were like
[1:03:05.440 --> 1:03:10.280]  Qaddafi's killing innocent protesters and has rape rooms and they fuel the all
[1:03:10.280 --> 1:03:17.280]  night rape sessions with with Viagra they're like put Viagra in there
[1:03:17.280 --> 1:03:20.720]  Americans know what Viagra is they'll they'll think it's real it'd be like
[1:03:20.720 --> 1:03:26.000]  bad man hurt lady they can point it Australia the average Americans like

[1:03:41.520 --> 1:03:45.120]  and I believe the average Austinite where I live will say nuke them to

[1:08:19.880 --> 1:08:31.600]  alex jones over a year ago we said that they would try to stage chemical
[1:08:31.600 --> 1:08:36.040]  attacks in syria and blame the Assad regime they're now in the media saying
[1:08:36.040 --> 1:08:40.880]  we've got to attack them and even trying to imply and I knew what happened
[1:08:40.880 --> 1:08:44.240]  during the break I was watching TV trying to connect it the attack on Syria to
[1:08:44.240 --> 1:08:47.960]  what happened on Boston it's kind of like 15 of the supposed hijackers come
[1:08:47.960 --> 1:08:53.160]  from Saudi Arabia so we attack Iraq and there's WMD's and mobile anthrax labs all
[1:08:53.160 --> 1:09:01.040]  lies it all came out premeditated lies now Obama is got his guy up there
[1:09:01.040 --> 1:09:06.640]  Hagel Chuck Hagel head of the Defense Department saying oh yeah we've got
[1:09:06.640 --> 1:09:09.920]  evidence they're the ones that launched the chemical weapons and that's exactly
[1:09:09.920 --> 1:09:13.280]  what the Assad regime's been saying you would never use it in asymmetrical
[1:09:13.280 --> 1:09:17.280]  warfare saying we saying they're gonna blame us al-qaeda has smuggled it in
[1:09:17.280 --> 1:09:21.620]  they're gonna try to frame us they said that about a year ago over a year ago we
[1:09:21.620 --> 1:09:27.200]  said that was the plan and it is incredible another war see see they've
[1:09:27.200 --> 1:09:31.880]  lost with al-qaeda and over 60,000 out of Saudi Arabia that NATO's brought in
[1:09:31.880 --> 1:09:36.400]  and Turkey's brought in and Turkey shelling Syria they've lost that take
[1:09:36.400 --> 1:09:42.880]  over that two-year war proxy war was just incredible atrocities against
[1:09:42.880 --> 1:09:47.040]  Christians and Jews by the al-qaeda group our government's putting in see they
[1:09:47.040 --> 1:09:50.640]  think you're so dumb and ignorant about geopolitical things that our government
[1:09:50.640 --> 1:09:55.280]  in NATO uses al-qaeda and even puts it in the LA Times and CFR and then the
[1:09:55.280 --> 1:10:00.440]  public doesn't even know that's going on but now they're saying oh lone actors
[1:10:00.440 --> 1:10:04.640]  with these bombers but they had Lindsey Graham the senator up there going the
[1:10:04.640 --> 1:10:11.440]  CIA so brave to known CIA agent on CNN Anderson Cooper but I think they're
[1:10:11.440 --> 1:10:16.160]  still on right as I came out they were on there on CNN I mean this is the type
[1:10:16.160 --> 1:10:22.000]  of garbage and CNN has so little viewers now they're putting cooking shows on we
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:26.640]  have more viewers than their top shows their top three shows every day combined
[1:10:26.640 --> 1:10:31.040]  that's conservative by the way I'm freaked out by the fact that one way or
[1:10:31.040 --> 1:10:36.120]  another 50 million people came through our websites in news show last week we
[1:10:36.120 --> 1:10:43.320]  have the Google Analytics 50 million people now no wonder they came out and
[1:10:43.320 --> 1:10:46.360]  then we're going to Gerald Salente as some stations just joined us in two days
[1:10:46.360 --> 1:10:50.400]  ago and said the bombers did it because of Alex Jones bombing suspect
[1:10:50.400 --> 1:10:55.240]  influence by mysterious radical infowars.com is who they blame that was
[1:10:55.240 --> 1:11:00.520]  AP Tamerlin linked infowars conspiracy theorist Alex Jones slate Tamerlin
[1:11:00.520 --> 1:11:04.680]  believed in basically every conspiracy theory slate news of Australia alleged
[1:11:04.680 --> 1:11:09.400]  bomber was Alex Jones conspiracy fan Tamerlin was Alex Jones fan Salon I'm
[1:11:09.400 --> 1:11:12.560]  not going to keep going over this Gawker accused marathon bomber influenced
[1:11:12.560 --> 1:11:16.760]  by infowars he also had Spider-Man and Michael Jackson on his Facebook so
[1:11:16.760 --> 1:11:22.520]  it's their fault too so all of this is going on ladies and gentlemen and now
[1:11:22.520 --> 1:11:25.880]  it's come out and been confirmed all over the Russian news the Georgian
[1:11:25.880 --> 1:11:29.080]  government released the documents Tamerlin was under the State Department
[1:11:29.080 --> 1:11:34.440]  and Zabignan Brzezinski in a CIA program gee really the Russians blew his cover
[1:11:34.440 --> 1:11:38.200]  now just as the mother said not two and a half years ago five years ago they
[1:11:38.200 --> 1:11:43.720]  came to the CIA that's in the New York Times today and said is this guy one of
[1:11:43.720 --> 1:11:47.200]  your spies because he's hanging out with terrorists who the West is funding to
[1:11:47.200 --> 1:11:50.920]  destabilize us and that's all on record just like our government runs Al Qaeda
[1:11:50.920 --> 1:11:55.120]  and Libby in Syria and then you've got the setup the drill confirmed all the
[1:11:55.120 --> 1:11:58.880]  other backpacks all of this probably part of a drill they set them up they're
[1:11:58.880 --> 1:12:01.680]  out partying they figure out they're coming after him was there a real
[1:12:01.680 --> 1:12:06.800]  shootout I don't know now he's confessed no judge no jury no proof with his
[1:12:06.800 --> 1:12:10.360]  throat cut out gets out of the boat fine cut his throat out Gerald Salente I
[1:12:10.360 --> 1:12:14.720]  want to get into your incredible new cover on the new trends journal that
[1:12:14.720 --> 1:12:19.240]  blew me away the fine art level of it of the temple of the bankers and how this
[1:12:19.240 --> 1:12:22.480]  is a global cult to them they even say that and I want to get into the new
[1:12:22.480 --> 1:12:28.000]  trends what happened in gold everything with you but I first got to ask you yeah
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:31.560]  expand on that cover that is just incredible artwork maybe like a movie
[1:12:31.560 --> 1:12:36.520]  cover to Prometheus or something the temple of the moneylenders and you know
[1:12:36.520 --> 1:12:39.840]  what Christ did to that so the whole point is Gerald you've heard me break
[1:12:39.840 --> 1:12:44.080]  this down because we're in the eye of the storm and they are coming after us
[1:12:44.080 --> 1:12:50.000]  now at every single level Gerald and it turns out the White House is hanging out
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:53.680]  with this Saudi who was on the terror watch list they said before Congress that
[1:12:53.680 --> 1:12:59.160]  wasn't true then it is I mean what do you make you know being a consultant
[1:12:59.160 --> 1:13:03.040]  working in government being the top world trans forecaster for more than 25
[1:13:03.040 --> 1:13:06.760]  years what do you make of what's happening and why are they coming after
[1:13:06.760 --> 1:13:12.480]  us like this well I can't associate with you I mean it's my last program
[1:13:12.480 --> 1:13:19.320]  with exactly yeah you know how could anybody believe these keystone cops from
[1:13:19.320 --> 1:13:25.800]  Boston this has to be not only in a front to our civil liberties and our
[1:13:25.800 --> 1:13:32.640]  rights but let's get this straight they closed down over a hundred square miles
[1:13:32.640 --> 1:13:38.520]  around the Boston area they stopped the trains from running between New York and
[1:13:38.520 --> 1:13:44.560]  Boston they barely run the way it is because our infrastructure stinks but
[1:13:44.560 --> 1:13:53.320]  I digress they stopped people from going to school stop commerce as they
[1:13:53.320 --> 1:14:00.600]  started raping our constitutional rights shelter in place shelter in place I
[1:14:00.600 --> 1:14:06.880]  got a shelter in place for you who made this crap up going door-to-door like a
[1:14:06.880 --> 1:14:14.920]  stopo let's take that C out of America and put a K in there forcing people out
[1:14:14.920 --> 1:14:21.440]  of their homes at gunpoint and the sheeple applauding people going out
[1:14:21.440 --> 1:14:27.000]  with just robes on and no shoes women with their hands up could hardly walk
[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:34.120]  down the stairs and these goons they all look alike a bunch of fat guys with a
[1:14:34.120 --> 1:14:44.440]  lot of body armor on keep them hands up and they couldn't look in blonde she
[1:14:44.440 --> 1:14:47.800]  didn't hold her hands up long enough let's shove up against the wall she's
[1:14:47.800 --> 1:14:50.960]  probably and a cop sent me an email saying well they all could be with the
[1:14:50.960 --> 1:14:54.480]  terrorist how about you're with the terrorist cops how about your suspect
[1:14:54.480 --> 1:15:07.680]  and the other thing is you read how many people said they wished they had guns
[1:15:07.680 --> 1:15:14.280]  no no no you don't need a gun you got Boston's finest listen they can't win
[1:15:14.280 --> 1:15:19.760]  a world series and they couldn't catch a 19 year old kid let's get this straight
[1:15:19.760 --> 1:15:26.000]  they closed down the entire city they could you imagine conventions going on
[1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:30.780]  what about what about chanting USA USA USA while they point guns at you and
[1:15:30.780 --> 1:15:35.120]  rough people up this is a total martial law test they say well it's for your
[1:15:35.120 --> 1:15:38.920]  safety everybody could be with the terrorist the cops actually said they
[1:15:38.920 --> 1:15:41.960]  could have been more terrorist well how about there could be Easter bunnies or
[1:15:41.960 --> 1:15:45.840]  Freddie Krueger hiding under the table this is the essence of martial law where
[1:15:45.840 --> 1:15:50.320]  we're all guilty until proven innocent and why has America never acted like this
[1:15:50.320 --> 1:15:54.840]  before you've never locked down a city because of one guy they needed to get
[1:15:54.840 --> 1:15:59.640]  him before he could tell his story to cut his throat out well again again you
[1:15:59.640 --> 1:16:04.360]  know that I mean I go to your site you know the news you write about it oh there
[1:16:04.360 --> 1:16:10.480]  was a gun you remember the gun battle between the kid in the boat and the
[1:16:10.480 --> 1:16:15.440]  police and they find no gun oh there were three guns and we only found one gun
[1:16:15.440 --> 1:16:20.800]  oh they robbed a 7-eleven no they didn't and then let's get this straight they
[1:16:20.800 --> 1:16:27.400]  lifted the state of siege they lifted martial law at 6 p.m. and then the
[1:16:27.400 --> 1:16:34.320]  citizen founding the guy goes outside takes a smoke oh see somebody's in his
[1:16:34.320 --> 1:16:40.680]  boat opens the thing there's his kid bleeding lying there he calls the cops
[1:16:40.680 --> 1:16:46.280]  and they come in with these tank like vehicles big bomb shooting the hell out
[1:16:46.280 --> 1:16:50.400]  of the by the way that was that guy's house I would have had a rifle I have
[1:16:50.400 --> 1:16:54.200]  a bullhorn I'd say come out of there right now or I'm gonna or I'm gonna you

[1:24:11.200 --> 1:24:15.680]  the info war it is no exaggeration we did the analysis I looked at it yesterday
[1:24:15.680 --> 1:24:23.400]  conservatively 50 55 million people extra came through info wars.com
[1:24:23.400 --> 1:24:27.080]  prisonplot.com and what we can gauge off the radio show and that's very
[1:24:27.080 --> 1:24:33.520]  conservative counting YouTube and other things that's very conservative because
[1:24:33.520 --> 1:24:41.760]  those are individual IP addresses if you look at if you look at all the other
[1:24:41.760 --> 1:24:47.160]  stuff it's unbelievable it is an event horizon level event which totally creeps
[1:24:47.160 --> 1:24:50.080]  me out because they're mad at me and they're trying to connect me to the
[1:24:50.080 --> 1:24:54.360]  bombing they're coming out saying I'm a demon on the official White House channel
[1:24:54.360 --> 1:24:58.440]  MSNBC media matters run by the White House and I was asking Gerald why he
[1:24:58.440 --> 1:25:01.040]  thinks this is happening and during the break you know he said because there's
[1:25:01.040 --> 1:25:04.240]  not many of us resisting but the good news is if we're getting that type of
[1:25:04.240 --> 1:25:09.240]  traffic it shows people are hungry and everywhere I go in public people don't
[1:25:09.240 --> 1:25:12.320]  even know who I am or they're not even listening to me I hear them talking
[1:25:12.320 --> 1:25:15.640]  about it being an inside job or them letting it happen or their liars they've
[1:25:15.640 --> 1:25:20.600]  lost all credibility but they're still in control now they're saying Syria has
[1:25:20.600 --> 1:25:24.320]  gotten you know nerve gas and use it so they've got to be attacked I mean I mean
[1:25:24.320 --> 1:25:28.400]  this is hitlerian what we're seeing this is this is where America's the bad guys
[1:25:28.400 --> 1:25:32.200]  invading people Hitler said Poland attacked Germany and lot about it they
[1:25:32.200 --> 1:25:36.120]  always have an excuse so Gerald this is a short segment I want to ask you what's
[1:25:36.120 --> 1:25:40.280]  gonna happen as the establishment loses all credibility but they still are in
[1:25:40.280 --> 1:25:44.740]  power and don't care and why do they want to prepare us for troops on the
[1:25:44.740 --> 1:25:49.080]  streets everywhere there are no exaggeration 50 plus military drills
[1:25:49.080 --> 1:25:54.120]  occupying cities going on right now where troops aim guns at citizens this
[1:25:54.120 --> 1:25:57.600]  has been going on incrementally they're building towards something what is gonna
[1:25:57.600 --> 1:26:02.400]  happen as they lose all credibility national polls shows 74% of Americans
[1:26:02.400 --> 1:26:05.560]  hate the government and don't trust them it's much higher than that what are
[1:26:05.560 --> 1:26:10.320]  these Chalcescu Ian scum these Kim Jong-un's gonna do try to bring us into
[1:26:10.320 --> 1:26:16.600]  pure North Korea well they have already again yeah we just sent you the link from
[1:26:16.600 --> 1:26:23.200]  our winter trends journal last year not this one of battlefield America and this
[1:26:23.200 --> 1:26:30.200]  is how it began as we wrote it martial law in the USA can it happen it's
[1:26:30.200 --> 1:26:37.680]  happened America has been decreed a war zone in which military rule can replace
[1:26:37.680 --> 1:26:44.240]  civilian rule imagine the United States of America the land of liberty a nation
[1:26:44.240 --> 1:26:48.200]  that intervenes around the world overthrowing governments in the name of
[1:26:48.200 --> 1:26:55.280]  democracy has robbed its own citizens of the last vestiges of their democracy on
[1:26:55.280 --> 1:27:06.520]  December 1st 2001 the United States Senate voted 93 to 7 to pass into law the
[1:27:06.520 --> 1:27:13.680]  National Defense Authorization Act and we go on you're talking about Syria this
[1:27:13.680 --> 1:27:17.720]  is from that wonderful trends journal with the cover that everyone loves so
[1:27:17.720 --> 1:27:22.640]  much with Jesus Christ chasing the money changes out of the temple looks like
[1:27:22.640 --> 1:27:31.040]  Chuck Hagel this is a year ago summer 2012 no talk like war talk by November
[1:27:31.040 --> 1:27:38.240]  it would would it be the we go on on the war front Syria was in the crosshairs
[1:27:38.240 --> 1:27:47.280]  and regime change was at the top of a US NATO Israeli and Arab League agenda
[1:27:47.280 --> 1:27:55.520]  Syria's Assad must go Obama says and one or after another Syria chemical weapons
[1:27:55.520 --> 1:28:01.600]  Obama says world is watching Israeli in tough warning over Syria weapons cash
[1:28:01.600 --> 1:28:08.680]  Netanyahu his bullet may get chemical weapons new Syria rises on specter of
[1:28:08.680 --> 1:28:14.960]  chemical weapons one after another it's a setup this is a year ago and now
[1:28:14.960 --> 1:28:21.120]  they're bringing it up again here's yesterday's financial times Israel says
[1:28:21.120 --> 1:28:27.320]  Syria use nerve gas against the rebels total crap and what you're asking me
[1:28:27.320 --> 1:28:32.520]  what they're doing what they're doing is I've said this when the economy began
[1:28:32.520 --> 1:28:42.360]  to collapse in late 2007 when all else fails they take you to war and you see
[1:28:42.360 --> 1:28:48.920]  how people rally around the flag when there's fear and hysteria oh I bet
[1:28:48.920 --> 1:28:52.520]  people would chant USA as they were putting pits and shot in the head I'm
[1:28:52.520 --> 1:28:57.160]  serious I think people would chant USA as they were put on cattle cars and if
[1:28:57.160 --> 1:29:01.400]  they watch their children fed into to woodchippers they would chant USA and
[1:29:01.400 --> 1:29:09.320]  salute the guys doing it USA USA USA now here's the good news as I see it look
[1:29:09.320 --> 1:29:13.480]  at all the people that are going to your sight in mind by the way I have a video

[1:29:31.280 --> 1:29:36.920]  on the day that the American Revolution began and when the Boston atrocity
[1:29:36.920 --> 1:29:41.680]  happened I believe we're on the verge of a new revolution and that there are a
[1:29:41.680 --> 1:29:45.720]  lot of people it only took 25 people stay there we're gonna talk about that on

[1:37:11.280 --> 1:37:16.600]  going back to Gerald Salente Gerald I'm just gonna give you the floor right now
[1:37:16.600 --> 1:37:19.200]  because I want you to get into what you were talking about how this is
[1:37:19.200 --> 1:37:22.880]  symbolically happened on Patriots Day well they staged it all I believe as
[1:37:22.880 --> 1:37:26.960]  their symbolic reconquering Boston this is a globalist top but what you see
[1:37:26.960 --> 1:37:31.520]  happening there and then what this is also distracting from as you've sent out
[1:37:31.520 --> 1:37:37.240]  in one of your tweets what else you are looking at with your piercing
[1:37:37.240 --> 1:37:43.360]  gravitas go ahead well again the significance to as people are going
[1:37:43.360 --> 1:37:48.440]  more toward your sites and mine and others like us is that they're fed up
[1:37:48.440 --> 1:37:53.760]  with the prostitute news and they know they're being lied to con to and they're
[1:37:53.760 --> 1:37:59.520]  disgusted with losing their rights the American Revolution only 25% of the
[1:37:59.520 --> 1:38:06.400]  population really fought it about they had about another 20% that were on the
[1:38:06.400 --> 1:38:11.680]  side but the rest were loyalists or doing nothing so we're in the same
[1:38:11.680 --> 1:38:16.640]  situation now and it's building I believe and I've been writing about it
[1:38:16.640 --> 1:38:21.800]  toward the second American Revolution but as we can see by the violence
[1:38:21.800 --> 1:38:27.560]  committed by the police in and the stormtroopers in the the emotional
[1:38:27.560 --> 1:38:33.360]  mental psychological and spiritual violence that they committed by causing
[1:38:33.360 --> 1:38:40.560]  calling martial law a state of siege in this episode in Boston that you cannot
[1:38:40.560 --> 1:38:46.720]  fight this war and I should not fight it I believe with weapons or violence it
[1:38:46.720 --> 1:38:52.880]  must be fought with the spirit with the mind and the heart an intellectual and
[1:38:52.880 --> 1:38:59.680]  spiritual revolution these people are so fraudulent they're so transparent they
[1:38:59.680 --> 1:39:05.160]  can be so easily defeated with the truth and morality that I believe we are now
[1:39:05.160 --> 1:39:10.480]  on the beginning and you are swelling viewership and listening audience as well
[1:39:10.480 --> 1:39:16.720]  as ours is proof of that on the other issue oh by the way I misstated I said
[1:39:16.720 --> 1:39:24.080]  2001 I meant 2011 when I was referring to the Trends Journal that the reason
[1:39:24.080 --> 1:39:30.040]  what's going on here and what's the distraction is the world economy is
[1:39:30.040 --> 1:39:35.520]  under collapse you go and I'm not saying this only you go back and you just
[1:39:35.520 --> 1:39:40.440]  read the last couple of days in the financial times and the better business
[1:39:40.440 --> 1:39:47.360]  news outlets and there's gloom and doom throughout the world they all know that
[1:39:47.360 --> 1:39:52.360]  this is not working the new news by the way coming out of Europe today is that
[1:39:52.360 --> 1:39:56.880]  they're going to be lowering again interest rates the European Central Bank
[1:39:56.880 --> 1:40:02.400]  so they could try to juice the economy again oh as we speak by the way Alex
[1:40:02.400 --> 1:40:09.640]  what is gold up today almost $30 again I don't give financial advice but to me I
[1:40:09.640 --> 1:40:15.960]  don't know how any thinking person could believe in fiat currencies that the
[1:40:15.960 --> 1:40:22.040]  devaluing in front of our eyes and I totally believe and we have a long
[1:40:22.040 --> 1:40:28.680]  story in the Trends Journal by Dr. Paul Craig Roberts about the systematic
[1:40:28.680 --> 1:40:36.000]  destruction of gold by the money junkies by the by the central bankers by the
[1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:41.200]  Goldman Sachs gang the Merrill Lynch Bob the Deutsche Bank bandits and the
[1:40:41.200 --> 1:40:47.560]  rest of the criminal operations it there are two mafias that are now taken over
[1:40:47.560 --> 1:40:53.640]  the world one is the money changer mafia and the other is the military
[1:40:53.640 --> 1:41:03.960]  industrial complex is this hyperbole is it is it the conspiracy theory no the
[1:41:03.960 --> 1:41:10.760]  first one the money changer again that wonderful Trends Journal that we had of
[1:41:10.760 --> 1:41:17.280]  Jesus Christ chasing the money changes out of the temple go to the Trends
[1:41:17.280 --> 1:41:23.280]  Journal the current edition we have the quote from James Madison the fourth
[1:41:23.280 --> 1:41:29.480]  president of the United States using the precise term money changers how they
[1:41:29.480 --> 1:41:35.720]  will use anything to destroy the people and to do anything to gain their means
[1:41:35.720 --> 1:41:43.560]  to gain control over the banking systems and the and the printing of money
[1:41:43.560 --> 1:41:49.720]  matters from Jesus Christ to James Madison so the money changer is not a
[1:41:49.720 --> 1:41:56.480]  conspiracy theory it's in front of our eyes on the military industrial complex
[1:41:56.480 --> 1:42:01.160]  who could have said it more eloquently who could have said it with more
[1:42:01.160 --> 1:42:11.080]  credence and credibility than Dwight D. Eisenhower five-star general supreme
[1:42:11.080 --> 1:42:17.400]  commander the allied forces during World War two two-term president of the
[1:42:17.400 --> 1:42:24.320]  United States warning the American people that the military industrial
[1:42:24.320 --> 1:42:31.960]  complex is robbing the genius of its scientists the sweat of its labors and
[1:42:31.960 --> 1:42:40.440]  the future of its children by turning this nation into a military militarized
[1:42:40.440 --> 1:42:46.880]  society and when you talk about the drones when you talk about all the
[1:42:46.880 --> 1:42:53.160]  weaponry all the battleships all of these stealth fighters all can you
[1:42:53.160 --> 1:43:02.560]  imagine if the genius of the scientists and sweat of the labors had gone in to
[1:43:02.560 --> 1:43:11.360]  building a higher civilization rather than one that is mimicked mouthpiece and
[1:43:11.360 --> 1:43:18.760]  talked about by has to be one of the slimmiest little characters that has
[1:43:18.760 --> 1:43:26.760]  ever hit the earth Lindsey Graham here's his quote in today's financial times
[1:43:26.760 --> 1:43:34.920]  quote we are fighting an adversary that is transforming itself all over the
[1:43:34.920 --> 1:43:41.760]  globe we need to broaden our ability to go after the enemy Lindsey Graham
[1:43:41.760 --> 1:43:49.800]  senator from South Carolina said on Tuesday quote the one mistake I will
[1:43:49.800 --> 1:44:00.080]  not tolerate is the mistake of believing that we are not at war one
[1:44:00.080 --> 1:44:07.280]  mistake that I will not tolerate who the hell are you I will not tolerate you
[1:44:07.280 --> 1:44:14.280]  little weenie you couldn't fight your way out of a paper bag who is this guy to
[1:44:14.280 --> 1:44:20.000]  tell us that we're at war what business do we have in Iraq what business oh
[1:44:20.000 --> 1:44:27.360]  there are bombers with Bush today celebrating the Bush library that we
[1:44:27.360 --> 1:44:34.320]  the taxpayers and all his cronies have to pony up to put up and Bush saying
[1:44:34.320 --> 1:44:41.760]  fear the history will decide whether or not his policies were correct what
[1:44:41.760 --> 1:44:47.120]  history will decide the facts are in front of us now by the time history
[1:44:47.120 --> 1:44:54.240]  looks at it it will be whitewashed why are we in Libya why are we going into
[1:44:54.240 --> 1:45:01.920]  Syria why do we have 35 bases throughout Africa in Africa calm why do we have
[1:45:01.920 --> 1:45:07.480]  hundreds of bases throughout the world what's happened to this country and now
[1:45:07.480 --> 1:45:11.920]  oh I love it there are floods in the Midwest people in
[1:45:11.920 --> 1:45:18.240]  displays and in outside of Chicago crying yeah because the infrastructure
[1:45:18.240 --> 1:45:24.640]  stinks we have no money look at Detroit look at the people out on the streets
[1:45:24.640 --> 1:45:32.320]  look at the jobs that we have and you got a cloud like little Lindsay boy but
[1:45:32.320 --> 1:45:39.080]  I'd like to see this guy after dark I wonder what kind of chains God is in
[1:45:39.080 --> 1:45:45.400]  black boots he's wearing in the other life of Lindsay to make a statement like
[1:45:45.400 --> 1:45:52.080]  this I am speechless you are absolutely on target and when you read the
[1:45:52.080 --> 1:45:55.840]  technocratic writings of all these eugenicist globalists from the 20s on
[1:45:55.840 --> 1:46:01.080]  up to now Ray Kurzweil all of them they say they're using us kind of like
[1:46:01.080 --> 1:46:06.240]  their minions they use more technical terms kind of their clone programmed
[1:46:06.240 --> 1:46:10.320]  human resource biological androids this is how they see it on their power trip
[1:46:10.320 --> 1:46:14.160]  they take our tax money they take it into the national security reservations
[1:46:14.160 --> 1:46:18.080]  that are really a breakaway civilization with more advanced stuff under
[1:46:18.080 --> 1:46:23.080]  national security they bring in the drugs they run all the crime and they
[1:46:23.080 --> 1:46:26.280]  now are breaking away from society and saying we're going to shut off your
[1:46:26.280 --> 1:46:30.760]  power plants we're gonna shut down stuff and move it to China where we own the
[1:46:30.760 --> 1:46:35.960]  the plants I mean it's just total mafia rule and now they know they may go to
[1:46:35.960 --> 1:46:39.840]  jail over the insider trading over all the crimes over the too big to fail
[1:46:39.840 --> 1:46:43.720]  derivative scams so instead they're just training us that we're all prisoners
[1:46:43.720 --> 1:46:48.920]  and we're on lockdown like we're in a super max prison and it's just totally
[1:46:48.920 --> 1:46:52.080]  illegal and totally criminal and they don't care they've talked to cops we're
[1:46:52.080 --> 1:46:55.600]  terrorists if we talk like this the veterans are terrorist I mean it's like
[1:46:55.600 --> 1:46:59.840]  a science fiction movie Gerald so how do we turn this around because I agree the
[1:46:59.840 --> 1:47:04.320]  awakening is happening and they want a war with us and I don't want it I mean
[1:47:04.320 --> 1:47:09.000]  they will lose this 5% started the war you say 25% that was by the end yeah but
[1:47:09.000 --> 1:47:14.320]  you know three to three to 5% started and really won most the stuff I mean we
[1:47:14.320 --> 1:47:18.160]  will crush them but the globalist will sit offshore and said that it may take
[1:47:18.160 --> 1:47:21.320]  10-year civil war they'll just buy everything up for pennies on the dollar
[1:47:21.320 --> 1:47:27.920]  afterwards so how do we arrest all them how do we break free the police that are
[1:47:27.920 --> 1:47:31.880]  basically brainwash androids on average I mean how do you get to somebody who
[1:47:31.880 --> 1:47:35.280]  doesn't know they're working for a technocracy you know Eisenhower's full
[1:47:35.280 --> 1:47:38.760]  speech as you know doesn't just be aware of the military industrial complex he
[1:47:38.760 --> 1:47:44.200]  says there is a technocratic elite in control and dominating 90% of the
[1:47:44.200 --> 1:47:50.040]  scientific development towards a military industrial complex scientific
[1:47:50.040 --> 1:47:54.080]  dictatorship that's because he was brought into this and said no I'm not
[1:47:54.080 --> 1:48:00.880]  going to be part of this so so people need to see the full speech yes and how
[1:48:00.880 --> 1:48:05.920]  is it going to change nothing changes into morality changes it's the golden
[1:48:05.920 --> 1:48:13.120]  rule I mean why shouldn't America be a target listen Alex quick story you go

[1:49:11.640 --> 1:49:17.880]  can't go into all these countries and not expect them to retaliate it's revenge
[1:49:17.880 --> 1:49:25.600]  no it's not they hate our freedom and liberty oh grow up I said then I started
[1:49:25.600 --> 1:49:31.360]  getting less calls the Afghan war breaks out they call me up what's gonna
[1:49:31.360 --> 1:49:35.080]  happen I said why ask me why don't you ask Alexander the Great asked the British
[1:49:35.080 --> 1:49:39.200]  asked the Russians it's gonna be a money pit for the military industrial
[1:49:39.200 --> 1:49:44.760]  complex will grow will kill more people our soldiers will get killed and hatred
[1:49:44.760 --> 1:49:51.720]  would build then I got less calls after that then the Iraq war happens you can
[1:49:51.720 --> 1:49:56.160]  look it up connect newspapers I was still put very popular in a lot of the
[1:49:56.160 --> 1:50:00.240]  segments of the mainstream media at the time they asked me to do an editorial on
[1:50:00.240 --> 1:50:05.080]  the outcome of the Iraq war it's there in black and white I said it'll be a
[1:50:05.080 --> 1:50:10.000]  swift battlefield victory Saddam Hussein will be overthrown considering the
[1:50:10.000 --> 1:50:15.760]  size of America's military might and it will devolve into a civil war and
[1:50:15.760 --> 1:50:22.120]  Americans will leave after too many of the soldiers have been killed too much
[1:50:22.120 --> 1:50:26.280]  money has been spent or they've lost their will to continue which is just
[1:50:26.280 --> 1:50:29.840]  common historical sense and the military industrial complex knew that they
[1:50:29.840 --> 1:50:34.200]  love it came out they would have kept Vietnam going for another 15 years
[1:50:34.200 --> 1:50:39.760]  because they were making so much money exactly oh man and then these defense

[1:56:16.280 --> 1:56:20.200]  I see these emails except from cops going hey Alex you know I like your show
[1:56:20.200 --> 1:56:23.360]  but in the terrorists could have been in any house any of those people could have
[1:56:23.360 --> 1:56:28.120]  been there accomplices like black women and blondes and 10-year-old kids I mean
[1:56:28.120 --> 1:56:32.240]  it's just your all suspects and we're gonna drive by your house and point guns
[1:56:32.240 --> 1:56:38.280]  at you and then and then when cops just like walking around stomping around what
[1:56:38.280 --> 1:56:42.640]  do you call that how do you get people to behave like this and dress up in
[1:56:42.640 --> 1:56:48.000]  stupid Darth Vader outfits over one 19 year old kid and then of course I heard
[1:56:48.000 --> 1:56:53.400]  the police scanners they shot his boat up the boat up full of bullets that he
[1:56:53.400 --> 1:56:56.880]  never shot at them that's now come out and then when he still got up and wasn't
[1:56:56.880 --> 1:57:00.280]  dead because the media got shots of it the cops on the scanner like oh no the
[1:57:00.280 --> 1:57:04.200]  media we got a tape back there we were capturing it the media's got a shot oh
[1:57:04.200 --> 1:57:07.080]  what are we gonna do is they were gonna make sure he was dead he stands up he's
[1:57:07.080 --> 1:57:10.680]  not bleeding out of the neck they get him in minutes later he's near death I
[1:57:10.680 --> 1:57:15.160]  think they chopped his vocal cords out so he could then confess what about them
[1:57:15.160 --> 1:57:18.600]  now saying he's confessed from his bed you don't do that before a quote trial
[1:57:18.600 --> 1:57:22.880]  I mean they could go kill you or me and say we confess to you know stealing the
[1:57:22.880 --> 1:57:27.160]  Mona Lisa they could say we confess to crucifying Christ Gerald to London we
[1:57:27.160 --> 1:57:30.360]  only got two minutes to break but what's your comment on that well you're
[1:57:30.360 --> 1:57:36.120]  right I mean there's a couple of things number one think about this we lost our
[1:57:36.120 --> 1:57:42.840]  rights our gun rights we're losing and now our civil rights because let's just
[1:57:42.840 --> 1:57:47.960]  say that these two kids did it we had Adam Lawns of the other lunatic and
[1:57:47.960 --> 1:57:53.160]  let's just say for argument's sake that these two guys pull this off what do we
[1:57:53.160 --> 1:57:58.480]  have to lose all our rights because of two kids you know what's going on here
[1:57:58.480 --> 1:58:03.560]  look what happened in Ireland during the times of the IRA bombs are going on
[1:58:03.560 --> 1:58:08.160]  fall over the place in the 70s you think they closed down Great Britain and
[1:58:08.160 --> 1:58:13.880]  Ireland no they didn't and the other thing you know the the other thing you
[1:58:13.880 --> 1:58:20.920]  mentioned about the Obama apologists this is from Jeremy Scale who has a
[1:58:20.920 --> 1:58:28.520]  book out at a film called dirty wars he said quote this unfortunately a lot of
[1:58:28.520 --> 1:58:34.000]  liberals have checked in their consciousness at the door that is not
[1:58:34.000 --> 1:58:37.800]  very healthy for our democratic process they would stay there back in 60

[2:01:24.800 --> 2:01:29.680]  it's not very healthy for how a democratic process not very healthy you
[2:01:29.680 --> 2:01:35.000]  know it's killing us here this is from my book trends 2000 I wrote back in you
[2:01:35.000 --> 2:01:41.640]  know the mid 90s I wrote about what happened with the Oklahoma terrorism so
[2:01:41.640 --> 2:01:46.520]  the Oklahoma bombing and then right after that here's an article from USA
[2:01:46.520 --> 2:01:53.040]  today terrorism bill Hertz writes the bill expands executive powers at the
[2:01:53.040 --> 2:01:58.640]  expense of both citizens and aliens the president alone could designate groups
[2:01:58.640 --> 2:02:06.120]  quote detrimental to the interests of the United States and it goes on not
[2:02:06.120 --> 2:02:13.760]  surprisingly the bill's godfather the FBI would also re-re-app new re-app new
[2:02:13.760 --> 2:02:20.400]  power that means your phone could be tapped if the FBI thought any suspect
[2:02:20.400 --> 2:02:26.600]  might use it so much for fourth amendment protection that's from USA
[2:02:26.600 --> 2:02:36.520]  today 1995 that's how that's how things have changed here they were coming out
[2:02:36.520 --> 2:02:42.960]  against it now you pick up the pages the editorial from the New York Times the
[2:02:42.960 --> 2:02:50.240]  toilet paper of record and they are so championing our loss of liberties and
[2:02:50.240 --> 2:02:57.680]  what's happened in Boston and Alex I urge everyone listening to please consider
[2:02:57.680 --> 2:03:03.920]  going to my YouTube channels either the Gerald Salenti or the Trends Journal
[2:03:03.920 --> 2:03:12.080]  YouTube channel and see our piece on a state of siege and also the one on

[2:03:26.680 --> 2:03:34.000]  by day we have sociopaths and psychopaths here a definition of a sociopath
[2:03:34.000 --> 2:03:42.800]  read George Bush's comments from that prostitute CNN interview yesterday I
[2:03:42.800 --> 2:03:50.440]  didn't do anything wrong I didn't do anything wrong sociopaths never do so
[2:03:50.440 --> 2:03:57.800]  the people don't rise up to a higher moral level than our society degrades to
[2:03:57.800 --> 2:04:04.360]  a Nazi Germany level oh and by the way you asked why is this happening it's what
[2:04:04.360 --> 2:04:13.080]  I said years ago four words have killed capitalism too big to fail fronie capitalism
[2:04:13.080 --> 2:04:21.080]  fascism the merger of state and corporate powers it's a takeover you're

[2:09:02.400 --> 2:09:06.760]  conditioning for martial law I just wanted to briefly ask you are they
[2:09:06.760 --> 2:09:10.160]  accelerating their program of acclimating us to troops on the streets
[2:09:10.160 --> 2:09:13.640]  and now openly announcing it because they're worried about the financial
[2:09:13.640 --> 2:09:23.520]  collapse I believe so I truly believe it that I again look what's going on in
[2:09:23.520 --> 2:09:28.080]  Spain look what's going on in Italy look what's going on in Greece look what's
[2:09:28.080 --> 2:09:32.000]  going on in Portugal look what's going on in Ireland oh yesterday they announced
[2:09:32.000 --> 2:09:37.200]  oh over there in the UK that third recession no one calls it a depression
[2:09:37.200 --> 2:09:43.120]  you have 30% plus unemployment in Greece in Spain throughout the area you have
[2:09:43.120 --> 2:09:48.160]  over 50% unemployment in many of these countries youth unemployment the entire
[2:09:48.160 --> 2:09:53.560]  systems are breaking down Cyprus is out of the news people forgot about it
[2:09:53.560 --> 2:09:58.240]  holiday remember that one the bank holiday it's collapsing there is
[2:09:58.240 --> 2:10:06.200]  absolutely no way that they can continue to print money to prop up the economy
[2:10:06.200 --> 2:10:12.880]  they've dumped in tens of trillions of dollars it has not worked and as
[2:10:12.880 --> 2:10:18.840]  societies break down you know my saying when people lose everything and have
[2:10:18.840 --> 2:10:25.280]  nothing left to lose they lose it and people are losing it they're losing it
[2:10:25.280 --> 2:10:29.600]  in Bulgaria and Romania they're losing it throughout the world and they're
[2:10:29.600 --> 2:10:34.080]  going to be losing it here well it just came out this week the statistics of
[2:10:34.080 --> 2:10:41.680]  suicide murder death breakups depression it's just exploding everywhere and I
[2:10:41.680 --> 2:10:46.440]  was reading today where their people are starving to death in Greece and that
[2:10:46.440 --> 2:10:50.720]  will happen here just like Argentina people Argentina was first world the
[2:10:50.720 --> 2:10:55.880]  globalists love this this is what they do with their mismanagement you know I
[2:10:55.880 --> 2:11:00.880]  was thinking about what's holding back the American spirit there are a lot of
[2:11:00.880 --> 2:11:04.880]  great people out there and I do see a change coming and you know I'm putting
[2:11:04.880 --> 2:11:09.760]  my money where my mouth is I'm buying historic buildings in colonial Kingston
[2:11:09.760 --> 2:11:14.840]  you know the the roots of the American Revolution are right here the Senate
[2:11:14.840 --> 2:11:20.920]  House is over here they burnt down this city in 1774 the British you know so I
[2:11:20.920 --> 2:11:25.680]  mean you know I believe in it but what's holding it back and I started to
[2:11:25.680 --> 2:11:33.720]  think if I had a job at Walmart if I worked at Target it while I worked at
[2:11:33.720 --> 2:11:40.840]  Costco I used to have a hardware store and now I have to work for Home Depot I
[2:11:40.840 --> 2:11:48.000]  used to own a stationery store and now I work for staples or office depot I used
[2:11:48.000 --> 2:11:55.280]  to own a mom-and-pop shop where we had clothing or or had the dare so you don't
[2:11:55.280 --> 2:12:01.520]  even hear that word anymore and now you know I work for Macy's so the people
[2:12:01.520 --> 2:12:06.760]  their spirit is being rotted out of them that's the television the television
[2:12:06.760 --> 2:12:10.760]  I call it television sickness they're just spectator zombies they've got a
[2:12:10.760 --> 2:12:13.120]  well-awakened they're still human let's take calls
[2:12:13.120 --> 2:12:18.880]  Erica and Tennessee are on the air with Gerald Salenty go ahead Erica on the
[2:12:18.880 --> 2:12:22.840]  air from Chelsea I'm fine go ahead go on Alex are we going Gerald good good
[2:12:22.840 --> 2:12:28.280]  excellent guys great to listen to you guys a lot of information a lot of really
[2:12:28.280 --> 2:12:34.040]  good stuff my question basically if you think back to the French Revolution when
[2:12:34.040 --> 2:12:38.240]  it started the people were so poor they were so sick they were so I mean they
[2:12:38.240 --> 2:12:42.120]  were just dying in the streets basically do you think it'll get to that point in
[2:12:42.120 --> 2:12:46.080]  America before we decide to fight back or do you think that the American spirit
[2:12:46.080 --> 2:12:49.240]  like you were talking about will actually come back and we'll be able to do
[2:12:49.240 --> 2:12:54.720]  something effective before it gets that bad I believe it could be done long
[2:12:54.720 --> 2:13:01.760]  before that you know you listen to the people that advertise the products you
[2:13:01.760 --> 2:13:08.520]  listen to Alex talk about the the advertisers on his show organic clean
[2:13:08.520 --> 2:13:16.360]  food clean environment you think about you think about the the aspects of
[2:13:16.360 --> 2:13:22.040]  integrity and courage and self-respect those are the things that change it I
[2:13:22.040 --> 2:13:27.360]  get letters all the time we have a piece at the end of this last trends
[2:13:27.360 --> 2:13:32.760]  journal from a young fellow 27 years old Dan Powell and I called the Powell
[2:13:32.760 --> 2:13:38.680]  prescription for progress and he wrote about how he's changed his life he eats
[2:13:38.680 --> 2:13:44.360]  organic he grows his own food he gets dressed every day you know he dresses up
[2:13:44.360 --> 2:13:49.640]  tries to feel better exercises lost weight and here's the and he said this
[2:13:49.640 --> 2:13:55.200]  is what will really excite you everybody around him is changing his
[2:13:55.200 --> 2:14:00.000]  girlfriend is changing his friends are changing his parents are changing when
[2:14:00.000 --> 2:14:05.360]  the people rise to the highest level within themselves everything changes
[2:14:05.360 --> 2:14:12.480]  don't believe me read young read the great philosophers read all of them the
[2:14:12.480 --> 2:14:18.920]  world changes when the consciousness changes and to me we have everything in
[2:14:18.920 --> 2:14:23.600]  place absolutely we are the revolution for liberty they are the revolution for
[2:14:23.600 --> 2:14:28.000]  tyranny there are different forces in this world stop being a spectator Eric
[2:14:28.000 --> 2:14:33.080]  anything else well basically I was reading the trend generally it's got the
[2:14:33.080 --> 2:14:38.960]  obituary for democracy at the beginning of it I really recommend that read to
[2:14:38.960 --> 2:14:43.880]  anybody you can download that in a PDF file sure and people get an argument
[2:14:43.880 --> 2:14:48.120]  about democracy republic I mean a republic is the will of the people but
[2:14:48.120 --> 2:14:51.360]  protected the bill of rights Constitution so it's really the same thing
[2:14:51.360 --> 2:14:55.560]  when Obama says democracy he means a pure one but then Gerald's point is this
[2:14:55.560 --> 2:15:00.480]  isn't even that it's a manufactured consent the 74% of the Americans in a
[2:15:00.480 --> 2:15:03.960]  Gallup poll hate the government so why is the government getting bigger because
[2:15:03.960 --> 2:15:07.280]  we don't have a republic we don't have a democracy what we've got is a
[2:15:07.280 --> 2:15:15.280]  manufactured kleptocracy thank you Eric Jason I'd like to comment on what Eric
[2:15:15.280 --> 2:15:19.240]  said yeah thank you for reminding me about that story in the trends journal
[2:15:19.240 --> 2:15:23.800]  about obituary for democracy I quoted from the toilet paper of record
[2:15:23.800 --> 2:15:28.400]  actually I believe it was 8 April 15th or around that time with the clips of
[2:15:28.400 --> 2:15:33.320]  trends journals just came out and they talked about Christine Lagarde the
[2:15:33.320 --> 2:15:38.240]  grand arm of the IMF you know what IMF stands for the International Mafia
[2:15:38.240 --> 2:15:43.240]  Federation and how they quote they're saying this the toilet paper and they're
[2:15:43.240 --> 2:15:48.760]  not even conscious of their words they say that she has become and the IMF a
[2:15:48.760 --> 2:15:55.760]  quasi government and that they have more power than countries in Europe and how
[2:15:55.760 --> 2:16:01.520]  she puts and they put leaders in charge and she's exempt from taxes but thinks
[2:16:01.520 --> 2:16:06.720]  you should work six seven days a week to pay her more money it but again and the
[2:16:06.720 --> 2:16:12.960]  point beyond that is that they're saying that the money junkies are in
[2:16:12.960 --> 2:16:21.000]  control yes it's saying it in the New York Times not my language their language
[2:16:21.000 --> 2:16:24.120]  and then if you read it the ADL or Southern Harvey Law Center calls you
[2:16:24.120 --> 2:16:27.760]  conspiracy theorist Jason in Alabama you're on the air or what's your question
[2:16:27.760 --> 2:16:34.920]  for Gerald Alex hey bro hey Gerald and Alex you talk to you guys they love the
[2:16:34.920 --> 2:16:39.080]  show I did my sarcasm out of the way and say they're doing a really good job of
[2:16:39.080 --> 2:16:44.120]  testing the globalist off while we're trying I know hey I wanted to talk to
[2:16:44.120 --> 2:16:48.880]  you guys about the police day we had a situation that happened to me and my
[2:16:48.880 --> 2:16:54.440]  wife just the other night and I think you know I mean I've been listening to
[2:16:54.440 --> 2:16:57.800]  you for about four years we've never really seen this before but this happened
[2:16:57.800 --> 2:17:00.800]  to us and so we're having to deal with it I'm not crying about it but we're gonna
[2:17:00.800 --> 2:17:05.480]  deal with it but we were at a club I'm a songwriter and an engineer and an
[2:17:05.480 --> 2:17:10.560]  anthropologist and all kinds of things but we were at a club and we left she
[2:17:10.560 --> 2:17:14.600]  wanted to she said to me she said I think we've had too much to drink
[2:17:14.600 --> 2:17:18.720]  tonight let me go get my purse and my phone and we were parked directly
[2:17:18.720 --> 2:17:25.240]  behind the club she went to go to get her purse there were two police officers
[2:17:25.240 --> 2:17:30.360]  that were standing behind the club and they approached her and they said who
[2:17:30.360 --> 2:17:35.440]  are you where are you coming from where are you going and she said look I don't
[2:17:35.440 --> 2:17:39.920]  have to answer these questions I'm just a person I'm trying to get my purse out
[2:17:39.920 --> 2:17:47.320]  of the car they literally beat her and arrested her and took her to jail she
[2:17:47.320 --> 2:17:53.720]  was by herself yeah they've converted police over now to they want to get
[2:17:53.720 --> 2:17:58.080]  notches on their belts we are the enemy they're trying to convert them to where
[2:17:58.080 --> 2:18:01.360]  the more they attack us the more tough they are and they've been told drive
[2:18:01.360 --> 2:18:04.840]  these people into submission Gerald what do you want to say to what this
[2:18:04.840 --> 2:18:08.560]  fellow just talked about well it's you know all this has really started to
[2:18:08.560 --> 2:18:12.280]  happen again every time that they there's an incident they take more and more
[2:18:12.280 --> 2:18:16.120]  of our rights away and then you look at a lot of who these people are becoming
[2:18:16.120 --> 2:18:20.480]  that of police they're coming back from Iraq they're coming back to Afghanistan
[2:18:20.480 --> 2:18:25.360]  I mean you know this whole thing is totally out of control and then you have
[2:18:25.360 --> 2:18:34.080]  a clown a clown a clown senator like Lindsay Graham saying this nation is a
[2:18:34.080 --> 2:18:40.480]  battlefield and where it wore and these people believe it who have become cops
[2:18:40.480 --> 2:18:45.680]  what I have to tell you this on the cop scene the cops in Kingston have to be
[2:18:45.680 --> 2:18:49.560]  among the coolest there's bad sections around here
[2:18:49.560 --> 2:18:54.280]  there's people out in the street having a drink at it an outside thing they
[2:18:54.280 --> 2:18:59.880]  don't bother anybody they know what bad is and that's what these cops have to
[2:18:59.880 --> 2:19:06.680]  understand leave the people alone you want to enforce the law start at the
[2:19:06.680 --> 2:19:13.920]  top go after the war criminals go after Rumsfeld go after that little weasel
[2:19:13.920 --> 2:19:20.680]  war for which you want to enforce the law leave us alone and go after cause
[2:19:20.680 --> 2:19:30.280]  like go after the Coleman sacks gang leave us alone absolutely so how did it
[2:19:30.280 --> 2:19:33.160]  end caller I'm gonna twist your arm one more segment your old ten more minutes
[2:19:33.160 --> 2:19:37.320]  take a few more calls but how did it end caller they she was asking the police
[2:19:37.320 --> 2:19:41.440]  he said art instead of you like antagonizing me aren't you supposed to
[2:19:41.440 --> 2:19:46.600]  be protecting me she's like I am alone there is my car I'm trying to call a
[2:19:46.600 --> 2:19:51.520]  cab and they had nothing to do with that they just wanted to violate her and
[2:19:51.520 --> 2:19:54.360]  arrest her and she went to jail and now we have to deal with the whole thing
[2:19:54.360 --> 2:19:58.360]  assume go after mall this is happening everywhere though they want to break our
[2:19:58.360 --> 2:20:06.480]  will they're telling them nice shooting hey that's a sweet AK-47 chest rig is

[2:25:54.440 --> 2:25:57.400]  part of the violation oh yeah well that's why they get into this it's all
[2:25:57.400 --> 2:26:01.840]  part of it I and I was at a party when this was happening and I said you know
[2:26:01.840 --> 2:26:06.840]  the Obama administration supported this and what no he didn't I said yes he did
[2:26:06.840 --> 2:26:13.360]  I said the solicitor general Verrilli argued for the strip search this woman
[2:26:13.360 --> 2:26:18.920]  got so unhinged call me a liar I didn't know what I was talking about I said look
[2:26:18.920 --> 2:26:25.280]  up the facts they the Obama apologists don't want to admit that their guy is as
[2:26:25.280 --> 2:26:31.160]  bad and worse than all of the rest of them it's just a continuation of our loss
[2:26:31.160 --> 2:26:36.960]  of rights that Bush started really taking Clinton actually yeah yeah tyranny is a
[2:26:36.960 --> 2:26:40.880]  bunch of kleptocrats who get above the law and then have a big party with us
[2:26:40.880 --> 2:26:46.080]  let's talk to Dan in Indiana you're on the air Dan hey thank you very much for
[2:26:46.080 --> 2:26:49.680]  taking my call and I want to tell you that everybody really around here
[2:26:49.680 --> 2:26:53.120]  appreciates the information you guys are sharing and seeking the truth out and
[2:26:53.120 --> 2:26:57.520]  one thing I want to comment on about two years ago the federal government put a
[2:26:57.520 --> 2:27:02.080]  building up here in this little town of 3,000 people that I'm from as they were
[2:27:02.080 --> 2:27:05.360]  putting the building up nobody knew what the building was and then it was an FBI
[2:27:05.360 --> 2:27:09.200]  building supposedly to monitor the power grid yeah it was the monitor the
[2:27:09.200 --> 2:27:13.400]  power grid alright not the not the electric power but while they were doing
[2:27:13.400 --> 2:27:18.120]  that somebody hit a fiber optic line every cell phone and every landline went
[2:27:18.120 --> 2:27:22.680]  down they are monitoring people through these fiber optic lines when they
[2:27:22.680 --> 2:27:27.240]  completed that building they run fiber optic lines hell high water through the
[2:27:27.240 --> 2:27:31.440]  dead of winter all over this country out here and as far as monitoring and
[2:27:31.440 --> 2:27:35.880]  information if people really want to know the technology that they have you
[2:27:35.880 --> 2:27:40.400]  can go to Google Maps you can go to Street View and walk the little guy down
[2:27:40.400 --> 2:27:43.720]  the street who's in what car and everything oh it's worse than that
[2:27:43.720 --> 2:27:48.160]  they're coming out with Google fiber 100 times faster they're putting it in
[2:27:48.160 --> 2:27:54.400]  Austin and exactly it came out in 96 that they have whole rooms or sometimes
[2:27:54.400 --> 2:27:59.760]  floors at all telecommunications and now under cybersecurity your company just
[2:27:59.760 --> 2:28:02.840]  like I didn't even get to this today I'm gonna cover when we come back and
[2:28:02.840 --> 2:28:05.960]  Gerald leaves us I got the business census they say they're gonna basically
[2:28:05.960 --> 2:28:09.280]  throw me in jail I've got to answer all these questions I like to put the
[2:28:09.280 --> 2:28:13.240]  amendment and if any of it's wrong I go to jail there's no law behind this they
[2:28:13.240 --> 2:28:17.320]  lie I went and checked it already knew that but this is the new thing that the
[2:28:17.320 --> 2:28:22.320]  bosses have to spy on their employees under cyber security this is the total
[2:28:22.320 --> 2:28:28.200]  end folks this is a criminal takeover Gerald Salente it is and again it's all
[2:28:28.200 --> 2:28:34.800]  before us and then again it all ties in as the economy gets worse as people
[2:28:34.800 --> 2:28:40.920]  become more desperate as society breaks down they will use any excuse to
[2:28:40.920 --> 2:28:44.400]  enslave and empower and their argument is when I was talking about the police
[2:28:44.400 --> 2:28:47.800]  state with the Austin police if he goes he doesn't hide do you I was like come
[2:28:47.800 --> 2:28:50.200]  on you know they're spying everything is what do you have something to hide no
[2:28:50.200 --> 2:28:53.760]  you got something to hide government go ahead Gerald and again who are these
[2:28:53.760 --> 2:28:59.600]  people to watch us you know what moral ground do they stand on that they're
[2:28:59.600 --> 2:29:06.240]  looking to see if we're behaving properly this is again just keep going back
[2:29:06.240 --> 2:29:13.560]  to the founding fathers that's all we have to do whether it's in foreign
[2:29:13.560 --> 2:29:18.920]  affairs and not getting involved in foreign entanglements or all of the
[2:29:18.920 --> 2:29:24.760]  bill of rights that have been put into place to protect us all we have to do
[2:29:24.760 --> 2:29:31.480]  in this country to move forward is to have a renaissance in what the
[2:29:31.480 --> 2:29:38.360]  Revolutionary War was about put it back into place and push absolutely we
[2:29:38.360 --> 2:29:41.640]  just have to go back to freedom and all this ends but we don't want to because we

[2:33:11.920 --> 2:33:15.920]  all right folks I'm gonna get to your phone calls after I get into the census
[2:33:15.920 --> 2:33:20.000]  and play this report with Mark Dice and John Bowne from just a few days ago
[2:33:20.000 --> 2:33:27.240]  they're on the Southern California coast outside Los Angeles just amazing
[2:33:27.240 --> 2:33:32.040]  information but I want to stop something right here federal law and the
[2:33:32.040 --> 2:33:37.440]  Constitution says that every 10 years and it goes back to Leviticus in the old
[2:33:37.440 --> 2:33:44.600]  Testament the people are to be numbered for congressional apportionment for
[2:33:44.600 --> 2:33:49.800]  congressional apportionment because your state according to how many people you
[2:33:49.800 --> 2:33:55.680]  have in it your state according to how many people live in it gets that number
[2:33:55.680 --> 2:34:02.760]  of House of Representative members that is done be a population but then also
[2:34:02.760 --> 2:34:08.640]  then the state gets two senators but the idea was the legislature would then
[2:34:08.640 --> 2:34:13.080]  elect the senator so they were purely creatures of the states the 17th
[2:34:13.080 --> 2:34:16.720]  amendment got rid of that now what's happening is they're trying to pass
[2:34:16.720 --> 2:34:22.680]  cybersecurity that makes employees indentured servants of the government
[2:34:22.680 --> 2:34:27.800]  managers in IT will have to spy on everyone and demand the username and
[2:34:27.800 --> 2:34:32.560]  pass codes to the Facebook's everything to give to Homeland Security any IT
[2:34:32.560 --> 2:34:36.920]  company that gives any type of service to a hundred or more people that means
[2:34:36.920 --> 2:34:40.080]  if you have a website with a hundred visitors you will have to go get federal
[2:34:40.080 --> 2:34:44.640]  licensing and training on how to be a Homeland Security spy you cannot make
[2:34:44.640 --> 2:34:50.120]  this up you cannot make this up now why do I raise that in conjunction with the
[2:34:50.120 --> 2:34:56.880]  census in 2000 we did reports on this I had him come to my house in a little you
[2:34:56.880 --> 2:35:01.040]  know blue collar area of Austin and the guy would park in the middle of the
[2:35:01.040 --> 2:35:05.960]  street and he'd come to my door and he'd say listen we're gonna have you
[2:35:05.960 --> 2:35:10.560]  arrested if you don't fill out this form I said good have me arrested and I would
[2:35:10.560 --> 2:35:13.520]  go to close the door and the guy actually stuck his foot in and I went open the
[2:35:13.520 --> 2:35:18.320]  door and I said okay buddy I said if you trespass in here I'm gonna defend my
[2:35:18.320 --> 2:35:22.680]  shelf and I'm calling the police right now and there was a zit face like 20
[2:35:22.680 --> 2:35:26.560]  nothing as funny as it faces it faced 20 year old guy on a power trip with his
[2:35:26.560 --> 2:35:30.360]  plastic badge and I said you're violating my fifth amendment and my fourth
[2:35:30.360 --> 2:35:35.160]  amendment he goes it's the law and I said let me see that form you're bringing
[2:35:35.160 --> 2:35:39.320]  again this is like the other four you've brought and and and by then my wife
[2:35:39.320 --> 2:35:42.280]  girlfriend at the time came up with the video camera we have this tape somewhere
[2:35:42.280 --> 2:35:46.480]  but at about that point I go you see here it says the US code that's off the
[2:35:46.480 --> 2:35:50.080]  law above it says how many people live here and what are their names that's
[2:35:50.080 --> 2:35:54.880]  what you can say under the Constitution that's what you can ask that's
[2:35:54.880 --> 2:35:59.280]  fraud that's constructive fraud all and he goes that's not true they told me that
[2:35:59.280 --> 2:36:02.280]  and I said you take your thing and I'm not filling any of it out the whole
[2:36:02.280 --> 2:36:06.320]  things are fraud I go go arrest me because I'd gone and looked up the
[2:36:06.320 --> 2:36:10.720]  federal rulings against the census as a fifth amendment violation it violates a
[2:36:10.720 --> 2:36:14.360]  bunch of other issues and here's the worst part on these new census they
[2:36:14.360 --> 2:36:18.640]  said in 2000s I really got into it then listeners remember that they said after
[2:36:18.640 --> 2:36:25.680]  2010 you will be given yearly censuses and by 2015 monthly censuses and they
[2:36:25.680 --> 2:36:28.080]  were already testing them then I happened to get the community survey that
[2:36:28.080 --> 2:36:32.720]  had 50 something questions what's my toilet do I own guns when do I go to
[2:36:32.720 --> 2:36:37.160]  work what are my stocks and bonds under penalty of perjury document cam shot

[2:36:46.360 --> 2:36:52.280]  registered mail saying your response is required by law your response they've
[2:36:52.280 --> 2:36:58.560]  expanded the fraud this is a business yearly survey and they already know
[2:36:58.560 --> 2:37:01.560]  everything about us in the deal it's already with the IRS by the way that
[2:37:01.560 --> 2:37:04.440]  violates your fifth amendment that that's paid the private federal reserve but
[2:37:04.440 --> 2:37:07.800]  that's an established criminal tyranny we're they will still come after you and
[2:37:07.800 --> 2:37:12.800]  so that's a battle we've already lost for now doesn't run the country all goes
[2:37:12.800 --> 2:37:16.320]  to offshore banks on record Ronald Reagan's own Commission found that quote
[2:37:16.320 --> 2:37:19.280]  not one red cent goes to fund the country they're like how we build the
[2:37:19.280 --> 2:37:22.920]  country we didn't have the income tax on 1913 and no one even had to pay it
[2:37:22.920 --> 2:37:31.360]  until the 1940s it was a temporary war tax for the boys oh my god most of it
[2:37:31.360 --> 2:37:34.680]  paid the German banks that created Hitler I mean you cannot make this up
[2:37:34.680 --> 2:37:40.200]  now just like the General Motors Opal factories the bombers weren't allowed to
[2:37:40.200 --> 2:37:44.840]  bomb them there was there was riots at Army Air Corps bases about that people
[2:37:44.840 --> 2:37:47.720]  are like we're dying and we're not allowed to bomb the real factories
[2:37:47.720 --> 2:37:55.360]  building tanks and aircraft see that's traitor talk that's traitor talk now

[2:58:50.400 --> 2:58:55.960]  a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had
[2:58:55.960 --> 2:58:59.760]  a pretty good-sized meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a
[2:58:59.760 --> 2:59:03.840]  well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the
[2:59:03.840 --> 2:59:07.240]  United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[2:59:07.240 --> 2:59:12.000]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our
[2:59:12.000 --> 2:59:16.520]  bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be healthy I then
[2:59:16.520 --> 2:59:21.280]  searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered

[3:01:47.760 --> 3:01:52.920]  Washington I said I said what do you do well we have seven rental properties
[3:01:52.920 --> 3:01:57.560]  apartments and houses and we've lost all of them except the last two we've been
[3:01:57.560 --> 3:02:03.720]  living in foreclosure for almost two years I retire in five months I said
[3:02:03.720 --> 3:02:09.360]  oh where do you work he says I work for Homeland Security I said oh Homeland
[3:02:09.360 --> 3:02:14.560]  Security I said he says yeah I'm one of the oldest ones there I said he said
[3:02:14.560 --> 3:02:20.920]  now they only hire 35 and younger but he on when 9-11 happened they needed
[3:02:20.920 --> 3:02:25.120]  literally thousands of people so they just hired people like crazy and I got
[3:02:25.120 --> 3:02:31.760]  he said I got in anyway he I said my friend says they you guys got hollow
[3:02:31.760 --> 3:02:36.320]  points we have we have pellets and pellets we have many many pellets of
[3:02:36.320 --> 3:02:41.520]  hollow points and he said we go to the range he said when I started during 9
[3:02:41.520 --> 3:02:46.520]  11 we'd go to the range every three weeks and we do we were trained just to
[3:02:46.520 --> 3:02:54.200]  do a warning shot in the air and then it changed to a a wound shot armor leg and
[3:02:54.200 --> 3:02:59.560]  now they're trying to shoot children mm-hmm now now they they shoot the kill

[3:03:10.080 --> 3:03:16.960]  run around giving high fives my boyfriend I'm sorry go ahead you can see
[3:03:16.960 --> 3:03:21.320]  that there's a real disconnect between a need to know basis because the guy
[3:03:21.320 --> 3:03:25.720]  doesn't have a clue why he lost his houses in his real estate he doesn't know
[3:03:25.720 --> 3:03:29.680]  that under meters they're taking houses that are totally paid for in cash 20
[3:03:29.680 --> 3:03:41.080]  years ago why not USA the absurdity of this people signing petitions to put
[3:03:41.080 --> 3:03:45.240]  America under Nazi Germany because they go is that government oh damn right I

[3:03:59.040 --> 3:04:03.360]  moving on that makes sense yeah that's a good idea that makes sense the other
[3:04:03.360 --> 3:04:08.880]  head up is for the last six months I've watched this country is dollarized so
[3:04:08.880 --> 3:04:13.600]  they were they under they have the US dollar here mm-hmm and he we've watched
[3:04:13.600 --> 3:04:19.760]  the US dollar just about $100 bills disappear and so about a month ago we
[3:04:19.760 --> 3:04:25.480]  tried to get a fair amount of exchange and and all they give us is $20 bills or
[3:04:25.480 --> 3:04:29.600]  $10 bills I asked the bank they said what's where is that where the $100
[3:04:29.600 --> 3:04:36.480]  bills they said there aren't any and now I just heard yesterday that in October
[3:04:36.480 --> 3:04:42.080]  they're gonna introduce a brand new $100 bill and let's end this with a USA that
[3:04:42.080 --> 3:04:51.680]  sounds great hyperinflation you let's see yeah get rid of the right you let's
[3:04:51.680 --> 3:05:14.200]  say to freedom hey
