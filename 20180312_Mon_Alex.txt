[00:00.000 --> 00:22.120]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty, you're listening to the Alex Jones
[00:22.120 --> 00:23.120]  show.
[00:23.120 --> 00:39.040]  This is fantastic, this is amazing, a certain anchor on CNN, fake as hell CNN, the worst.
[00:39.040 --> 00:56.440]  So fake, fake news.
[00:56.440 --> 01:05.920]  And the ratings are lousy by the way and compared to Fox their ratings.
[01:05.920 --> 01:10.200]  So let's go to one more little clip here of the president at that rally because it just
[01:10.200 --> 01:13.640]  gets better and better, doesn't it?
[01:13.640 --> 01:21.720]  That's the crowd chanting, CNN sucks, and then we've got him calling Chuck Todd a sleeping
[01:21.720 --> 01:23.120]  son of a bitch.
[01:23.120 --> 01:24.120]  Here it is.
[01:24.120 --> 01:32.680]  You ever see the story where I'm, it's 1999, I'm on Meet the Press, a show now headed by
[01:32.680 --> 01:39.760]  Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd, sleeping son of a bitch, I'll tell you.
[01:39.760 --> 01:44.160]  Lazy piece of crap, all of them are, but they hate us.
[01:44.160 --> 01:50.160]  And they showed it this morning, 1999, and I'm talking about North Korea, you got to
[01:50.160 --> 01:52.440]  take them out now.
[01:52.440 --> 01:56.600]  And then they have Clinton saying, we are pleased to announce that we have made a deal
[01:56.600 --> 01:57.600]  with North Korea.
[01:57.600 --> 01:59.600]  Well, you know how that deal turned out, right?
[01:59.600 --> 02:05.240]  We gave billions and billions of dollars and lots of other things.
[02:05.240 --> 02:07.600]  And they developed nuclear weapons with it.
[02:07.600 --> 02:12.320]  But now Kim Jong-un has already agreed no more missile tests and he has agreed to scrap
[02:12.320 --> 02:17.760]  his nuclear program in exchange for technical assistance with things like electrical power
[02:17.760 --> 02:19.520]  plants and trade.
[02:19.520 --> 02:26.080]  And the word is the agreement has already been made because the West through China has
[02:26.080 --> 02:35.600]  been propping it up since 1953 on February and July through that year on the 27th of
[02:35.600 --> 02:37.720]  July.
[02:37.720 --> 02:43.560]  The deal was made with the UN and Harry Truman to let the communist Chinese take control
[02:43.560 --> 02:47.080]  of the North and carry out their horrible activities.
[02:47.080 --> 02:52.880]  And MacArthur was relieved of command by a traitor, Harry S. Truman, the globalist.
[02:52.880 --> 02:56.680]  And so the whole time, just like two years before our own government, our own CIA, our
[02:56.680 --> 03:05.720]  own foundations, they put Mao Zedong into power in 1948.
[03:05.720 --> 03:09.120]  And then a couple years later, everybody knows what ended up happening.
[03:09.120 --> 03:10.120]  Amazing.
[03:10.120 --> 03:16.280]  The CIA was set up in 47 as a foreign globalist group to be over the United States and to
[03:16.280 --> 03:21.040]  take control of it and to basically make us lose all the future wars and use our treasure
[03:21.040 --> 03:23.840]  and power to build the globalist, their world empire.
[03:23.840 --> 03:25.280]  Well, guess what?
[03:25.280 --> 03:33.680]  America on January 20th, 2017, retook the beachhead in D.C.
[03:33.680 --> 03:38.720]  And we have begun the process of transferring the power back to the Republic and back to
[03:38.720 --> 03:41.760]  the people and back on the American mission.
[03:41.760 --> 03:48.920]  Since 1947, they've had their beachhead and they had almost extinguished the Republic
[03:48.920 --> 03:53.200]  and their cultural poison and their globalism is still venom in our veins.
[03:53.200 --> 03:54.800]  But we are getting stronger.
[03:54.800 --> 03:59.200]  They are getting weaker.
[03:59.200 --> 04:00.360]  That's what's happened.
[04:00.360 --> 04:03.200]  That is the great quest and we're in the middle of it.
[04:03.200 --> 04:10.880]  I have had beyond an epiphany taking off the last week partially and it has shook me to
[04:10.880 --> 04:17.720]  my very core that I've got to be even more focused and more professional and more serious.
[04:17.720 --> 04:25.960]  And the audience has a commitment for me that I am going to give it all I've got.
[04:25.960 --> 04:29.400]  And I've been giving it all I've got, but at a subconscious level, I kind of feel sorry
[04:29.400 --> 04:38.120]  for myself and, you know, sometimes don't have that eye of the tiger focus that I should.
[04:38.120 --> 04:44.280]  But let me tell you, it has been rekindled not by taking time off, but by experiencing
[04:44.280 --> 04:48.760]  the true evil growing in this country that we cannot let win.
[04:48.760 --> 04:55.160]  We have to have drastic countermeasures and I mean covert action now, not just overt.
[04:55.160 --> 05:00.400]  It's time for covert operations.
[05:00.400 --> 05:03.760]  Introducing Cell Force by Info Wars Life.
[05:03.760 --> 05:08.360]  Cell Force focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[05:08.360 --> 05:11.120]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[05:11.120 --> 05:13.640]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[05:13.640 --> 05:18.480]  Cell Force helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria, much
[05:18.480 --> 05:20.960]  like a cellular engine overhaul.
[05:20.960 --> 05:25.440]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing
[05:25.440 --> 05:27.880]  reactive oxygen species.
[05:27.880 --> 05:33.040]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from
[05:33.040 --> 05:35.960]  these reactive oxygen species.
[05:35.960 --> 05:41.000]  The antioxidants found in Cell Force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[05:41.000 --> 05:45.840]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen
[05:45.840 --> 05:48.360]  species and other free radicals.
[05:48.360 --> 05:53.640]  Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force from Info Wars Life.

[06:23.640 --> 06:30.760]  We have a beachhead in D.C. on January 20th, 2017.
[06:30.760 --> 06:38.120]  We achieved that beachhead beginning to reverse the globalist takeover that began to have
[06:38.120 --> 06:47.040]  serious success with the National Security Act of 1947 when they got their foreign covert
[06:47.040 --> 06:55.440]  operations coup d'etat over the heart of the federal government.
[06:55.440 --> 07:04.160]  And now, 60-plus years later, just as the Russians, after 80-plus years, pulled out
[07:04.160 --> 07:11.560]  of communism, partially, began the pull away from globalism, from the social engineering,
[07:11.560 --> 07:17.320]  from the satanic system, is really what it is, of the eugenicist of the globalist.
[07:17.320 --> 07:22.680]  We have begun our pull away as well, and every other nation on earth is beginning its pull
[07:22.680 --> 07:29.480]  away because there is a group consciousness, there is a racial, cultural awareness in every
[07:29.480 --> 07:37.040]  human that bleeds red blood and breathes oxygen on the face of this planetoid orbiting the
[07:37.040 --> 07:39.120]  sun.
[07:39.120 --> 07:47.360]  You can feel the void in your heart, my friends, the moment you begin to realize this is a
[07:47.360 --> 07:49.000]  spiritual battle.
[07:49.000 --> 07:54.000]  And the moment you use free will to begin to even understand that's the case, you will
[07:54.000 --> 08:00.800]  feel the void emptying once you're conscious of that and understand that.
[08:00.800 --> 08:04.880]  We only see a very limited spectrum with our five senses.
[08:04.880 --> 08:19.600]  We only feel and taste and see a tiny fraction, but our spirit and our mind and our gut can
[08:19.600 --> 08:28.560]  even feel the intergalactic space wind blowing through our souls, like ancient beautiful
[08:28.560 --> 08:30.720]  wind chimes.
[08:30.720 --> 08:38.360]  Now, it is that ancientness of us that threatens the fallen.
[08:38.360 --> 08:43.600]  It is the fact that we hold dominion over the planet, over the galaxy, over the universe
[08:43.600 --> 08:50.440]  that we have been given the birthright to the stars by the God of the universe that
[08:50.440 --> 09:00.840]  built us in his image and gave us free will, and it is that statement and that truth that
[09:00.840 --> 09:07.720]  strikes fear into the hearts of all those that have decided to join the dark side for
[09:07.720 --> 09:12.880]  limited temporal power only to kill, steal and destroy.
[09:12.880 --> 09:17.600]  That's why evil goes out of its way to do bad because it's evil.
[09:17.600 --> 09:23.040]  That's why when doing good would help them and empower them physically and spiritually,
[09:23.040 --> 09:29.560]  they reject it because they are lovers of death.
[09:29.560 --> 09:33.120]  Well, I'm not a lover of death.
[09:33.120 --> 09:45.920]  I love life so much that I just want you to be separated from us, and that's really what
[09:45.920 --> 09:50.640]  you don't want, isn't it, vampires?
[09:50.640 --> 09:52.400]  But hell awaits.
[09:52.400 --> 09:54.360]  This way destruction.
[09:54.360 --> 09:56.360]  Enjoy yourselves.
[09:56.360 --> 10:07.080]  All right, let me try to get into the news here because I get all wound up and I get
[10:07.080 --> 10:10.880]  all dialed into the news and then I just kind of run down the rabbit trail without getting
[10:10.880 --> 10:21.480]  into the big issues that surround it, but here's what's coming up today.
[10:21.480 --> 10:32.720]  Tommy Robinson is a patriot, and he understands that all around him, a globalist, communist,
[10:32.720 --> 10:39.520]  Islamic enforced tyranny, an iron curtain is descending over Europe and the UK.
[10:39.520 --> 10:44.840]  And he went to no-go zones where female reporters get beat up in Rome, and when the folks come
[10:44.840 --> 10:52.080]  over to attack him and say, we're going to kill your family, he knocks the guy out.
[10:52.080 --> 10:56.820]  And then Antifa has a bounty out on him in London.
[10:56.820 --> 11:06.300]  So they see him at a McDonald's and 10 of them show up trained in the universities to
[11:06.300 --> 11:14.440]  attack anybody that's nationalist, and they beat up his female reporter, Lucy Brown, who's
[11:14.440 --> 11:24.760]  a middle-aged woman, and she fights back and they run, and then he knocks down five of
[11:24.760 --> 11:27.320]  them and then they run.
[11:27.320 --> 11:33.840]  This video that's on infowars.com, the raw video as well as just the cut-downs or 12
[11:33.840 --> 11:34.840]  minutes of it.
[11:34.840 --> 11:41.440]  Raw, there's so much cussing, we can't play it all here by the Antifa, is everything you
[11:41.440 --> 11:42.440]  need to know.
[11:42.440 --> 11:44.560]  It is the universe in total.
[11:44.560 --> 11:47.320]  It is the Rosetta Stone.
[11:47.320 --> 11:53.240]  It is the skeleton key I talk about, where there are things, events, happenings.
[11:53.240 --> 11:56.680]  As they say, a picture tells a thousand words.
[11:56.680 --> 11:59.560]  Well, what does 12 minutes tell?
[11:59.560 --> 12:07.760]  It tells everything, everything, to understand the Islamic Mayor Sadiq Khan, the dozens of
[12:07.760 --> 12:12.360]  police officers that knew it was going on, monitoring social media and showed up like
[12:12.360 --> 12:19.840]  spectators to watch it happen, clearly planned by the police with Antifa, tracking him with
[12:19.840 --> 12:23.200]  all their software and systems.
[12:23.200 --> 12:28.560]  You don't just think these, you know, 10-plus goons just happened in their masks to send
[12:28.560 --> 12:30.000]  down on this.
[12:30.000 --> 12:35.440]  So, you've got the SJW police in blue states, and this is all over the world, in global
[12:35.440 --> 12:40.640]  and controlled areas, working in concert with the street thugs, just like Hitler had his
[12:40.640 --> 12:44.160]  essay.
[12:44.160 --> 12:48.080]  You have the essay that then worked with the SS, but then later the SS get rid of the
[12:48.080 --> 12:49.080]  essay.
[12:49.080 --> 12:51.440]  These are the useful idiots, and it's the same everywhere.
[12:51.440 --> 12:56.120]  They deploy them, they protect them, and you've got that angle, and then you've got
[12:56.120 --> 13:01.000]  the stupid little soy boys who are white who believe because of their guilt, they're supposed
[13:01.000 --> 13:05.160]  to go out and beat up other white people, and you've got them attacking a woman and
[13:05.160 --> 13:09.600]  a man, and then they get driven off because they can't believe it's not a video game,
[13:09.600 --> 13:16.520]  somebody actually fights back while still filming it, wow.
[13:16.520 --> 13:21.600]  And then the media spins it in the Daily Mail that, oh, Tommy Robinson got in a fight with
[13:21.600 --> 13:22.600]  people.
[13:22.600 --> 13:27.840]  It says, oh, it's not clear who started it, oh, he's just backing up with 10 people marching
[13:27.840 --> 13:33.680]  in in masks, and then they go get her camera and start viciously attacking a woman.
[13:33.680 --> 13:39.080]  He then fights back, tries to retreat into the store, the more come, he knocks them down,
[13:39.080 --> 13:41.080]  and finally they flee.
[13:41.080 --> 13:49.200]  So, you know, I say a Rosetta Stone, I could talk about this for 20 hours and show each
[13:49.200 --> 13:57.640]  little 10 seconds, and then give a whole university-level breakdown, like a college course, on the total
[13:57.640 --> 14:10.240]  deception, the total deception, that Mr. Robbins isn't against the Christian Africans, he's
[14:10.240 --> 14:13.680]  not against the Sikhs, he's not against the Indians, they all love him, he gets invited
[14:13.680 --> 14:17.840]  to all their, they recognize the Islamists, they know the danger, they know what happens
[14:17.840 --> 14:21.000]  once the Islamists get to 10%, they never let you have your religion, they take over
[14:21.000 --> 14:23.360]  and kill everybody, who doesn't submit.
[14:23.360 --> 14:27.520]  They understand how the left is allied with it, using it as a takeover army.
[14:27.520 --> 14:30.400]  They have on average six children, Europeans have 1.3.
[14:30.400 --> 14:35.480]  They understand it's all anti-white, anti-culture, to overwrite that culture and bring in a new
[14:35.480 --> 14:41.480]  Balkanized slavery, where everything's like a prison, everybody in their own little districts,
[14:41.480 --> 14:44.320]  so they call him a Nazi.
[14:44.320 --> 14:49.080]  And even if he was a Nazi, which he isn't, he has a right to be in a hamburger place
[14:49.080 --> 14:53.760]  and not have the police waiting outside, knowing it's him, and I've been doing a live feed,
[14:53.760 --> 14:59.680]  I've talked to him, he's coming on today.
[14:59.680 --> 15:04.720]  But first they dehumanize him, just like they did when I was on an airplane, and a man walks
[15:04.720 --> 15:09.920]  by videotaping me and he says, haha look, you've lost your family and I'm there with
[15:09.920 --> 15:15.440]  all four of my children, flying back from Colorado, skiing.
[15:15.440 --> 15:20.280]  And I get off the plane, I've got video, and I go to baggage claiming he's there.
[15:20.280 --> 15:25.240]  And then he, I'm going to put the video out.
[15:25.240 --> 15:28.000]  We have a discussion, he says I deserve to go to prison, I deserve to be taken off the
[15:28.000 --> 15:31.360]  internet, but he supports free speech, but I should be banned.
[15:31.360 --> 15:35.560]  And then my son goes with bags, and I'm getting more, and they go over and say, do you want
[15:35.560 --> 15:42.080]  to throw down to him, two gay guys, and they said, we're a downtrodden group, you're oppressing
[15:42.080 --> 15:44.800]  us, and I'm like, I don't care if you're gay, but it doesn't matter.
[15:44.800 --> 15:49.560]  They say I hate them, so they get to then go, two grown men, big guys, try to fight my
[15:49.560 --> 15:53.960]  son, and then some listener came up and said, you want to fight, fight me.
[15:53.960 --> 15:59.920]  I mean, that is what this country's turned into, folks, is just gangs of thugs.
[15:59.920 --> 16:02.440]  This is Dan Pilla, do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[16:02.440 --> 16:04.000]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[16:04.000 --> 16:08.080]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years, I've helped thousands, and I can
[16:08.080 --> 16:09.080]  help you too.
[16:09.080 --> 16:13.040]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement, and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless
[16:13.040 --> 16:14.040]  case.
[16:14.040 --> 16:17.720]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[16:17.720 --> 16:21.520]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[16:21.520 --> 16:28.920]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, that's 800-34-NO-TAX, or my website, danpilla.com.
[16:28.920 --> 16:34.280]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance.
[16:34.280 --> 16:38.360]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's
[16:38.360 --> 16:40.120]  medical expenses.
[16:40.120 --> 16:45.080]  Individual share amounts begin at $107 a month and $347 for families.
[16:45.080 --> 16:49.240]  Choose from three health sharing programs, holistic treatments may be eligible for sharing,
[16:49.240 --> 16:53.520]  see guidelines, discount programs available for dental, vision, and pharmacy.
[16:53.520 --> 16:59.280]  Go to libertyoncall.org, that's libertyoncall.org.
[16:59.280 --> 17:03.800]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol
[17:03.800 --> 17:07.920]  levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[17:07.920 --> 17:12.880]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes, and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat
[17:12.880 --> 17:16.520]  are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[17:16.520 --> 17:21.000]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[17:21.000 --> 17:22.000]  across America.
[17:22.000 --> 17:26.080]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[17:26.080 --> 17:29.560]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much

[18:09.400 --> 18:13.440]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[18:13.440 --> 18:17.800]  Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[18:17.800 --> 18:23.120]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[18:29.520 --> 18:34.640]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn
[18:34.640 --> 18:36.520]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[18:36.520 --> 18:41.040]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections
[18:41.040 --> 18:43.800]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[18:43.800 --> 18:48.480]  Stop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[19:00.480 --> 19:05.400]  Michael ZX is back, and just like we're game changing when it comes to politics, when it
[19:05.400 --> 19:09.240]  comes to the economy, we're game changing on supplements.
[19:09.240 --> 19:13.320]  I want to bring you products from the best research out there, from the best labs, the
[19:13.320 --> 19:17.280]  best laboratories, the best scientists that really change lives.

[19:25.240 --> 19:26.240]  it.
[19:26.240 --> 19:31.800]  You say a fungus is a scourge, mold's a scourge, and you can't battle it with this in your
[19:31.800 --> 19:34.840]  sinus or other areas, but in your gut, the main area you can.

[20:14.160 --> 20:22.120]  I grow up, I want to see my grandchildren unlock the secrets of the universe, I grow up, I want
[20:22.120 --> 20:32.080]  to see evil defeated, I grow up, I want life extension, I grow up, I want to see interstellar
[20:32.080 --> 20:39.840]  space travel, I grow up, I want to see God's face.
[20:39.840 --> 20:46.400]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[20:46.400 --> 20:50.880]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[20:50.880 --> 20:53.800]  They hate us because of our spirit.
[20:53.800 --> 20:58.080]  They hate us because we love life, we have will.
[20:58.080 --> 21:01.680]  They hate us because we know they're losers.
[21:01.680 --> 21:06.400]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we're broadcasting worldwide.
[21:06.400 --> 21:08.600]  Tommy Robinson is amazing.
[21:08.600 --> 21:13.640]  He has been, I'll just say this, wanting to work with him for wars, but he was in contracts
[21:13.640 --> 21:18.160]  with other folks and I just told him that I don't want to get in the middle of that
[21:18.160 --> 21:19.160]  now that he's not.
[21:19.160 --> 21:24.520]  I'll just tell you right now, I am trying to develop a plan to work with him and to
[21:24.520 --> 21:27.920]  be able to finance his operations in the UK.
[21:27.920 --> 21:30.240]  They are blocking people even getting into the UK.
[21:30.240 --> 21:33.560]  We have some of those folks joining us tomorrow.
[21:33.560 --> 21:40.200]  Some women, known activists, Lauren Southern and others, they got detained for days saying
[21:40.200 --> 21:44.280]  that they're basically inciting things because they were going to go to Speaker's Corner
[21:44.280 --> 21:50.800]  where for 500 years in London, people go to sit on a soapbox and speak.
[21:50.800 --> 21:52.640]  They label them Nazis, which they're not.
[21:52.640 --> 21:54.960]  They're a free speech group.
[21:54.960 --> 22:00.000]  They flew back to Germany and there's powerful footage of all that coming up.
[22:00.000 --> 22:07.600]  It's at tommyrobson.online, but Mr. Robinson is branching out, doing a lot of great reporting
[22:07.600 --> 22:10.720]  and so he looks to work with Paul Watson.
[22:10.720 --> 22:14.840]  That's what he wants to do again.
[22:14.840 --> 22:22.360]  So now that he is on his own, we are going to be working with Mr. Robinson and trying
[22:22.360 --> 22:27.720]  to build a studio, trying to get him a larger team of people and yes, it'll take money.
[22:27.720 --> 22:29.400]  They do plan on killing him.
[22:29.400 --> 22:30.400]  They do know he's a leader.
[22:30.400 --> 22:31.400]  They're scared of him.
[22:31.400 --> 22:33.520]  He's got a lot of charisma, a lot of passion.
[22:33.520 --> 22:35.200]  He's reaching out to all the minority groups.
[22:35.200 --> 22:43.480]  They love him and they're really scared of him and so he needs security and so that's
[22:43.480 --> 22:50.800]  one reason we need to expand our capital here because I'm not just going to sit there and
[22:50.800 --> 22:55.400]  throw that guy out there by himself like he's been doing and I've been warning him that
[22:55.400 --> 22:59.080]  the police are going to sit, they're globalists there, run by Sadiq Khan, the Islamists, they're
[22:59.080 --> 23:00.080]  going to set him up.
[23:00.080 --> 23:04.560]  I've had private conversations with him because I know the last folks he worked with, his
[23:04.560 --> 23:07.240]  frustration was that they didn't want him out on the street and I said, you need to
[23:07.240 --> 23:11.280]  do a balance of that and you need security when you do it.
[23:11.280 --> 23:15.920]  I said, because they're going to kill you and I think he gets that and I don't think
[23:15.920 --> 23:17.480]  he has a martyr complex.
[23:17.480 --> 23:21.760]  He sees them kidnapping kids, the grooming of young girls is back in the news, thousands
[23:21.760 --> 23:25.960]  were towns selling them in the sex slavery and they get flown out on planes, the middle
[23:25.960 --> 23:34.400]  east, I mean it is harvest time for the globalists and Islam in the UK and so they're now, he's
[23:34.400 --> 23:37.520]  not going out and doing public events, he's not going out looking for trouble, they're
[23:37.520 --> 23:43.120]  tracking him in live time, he's got to start using burner phones when he leaves the house.
[23:43.120 --> 23:47.640]  They're planning to kill him and I keep telling him that the advice he probably got from rebel
[23:47.640 --> 23:50.520]  media that he was previously with was pretty good advice.
[23:50.520 --> 23:56.280]  So I told him, I said, Mr. Robinson, I don't have the money to do this, right?
[23:56.280 --> 24:02.720]  I want to publish your book about Islam and Mohammed's own words, I've read it, it's
[24:02.720 --> 24:06.960]  excellent, I want to put it in the US, I said I want to finance this and I said I want you
[24:06.960 --> 24:11.960]  to have a studio and I want you to work with Paul and Paul's agreed to kind of honcho it
[24:11.960 --> 24:16.360]  and I want to build a whole news organization but I said, we got to be very judicious, I
[24:16.360 --> 24:19.880]  understand you're not afraid to die and neither am I but you're going to be a general in
[24:19.880 --> 24:23.000]  the fight, they're going to be shooting at you brother.
[24:23.000 --> 24:28.760]  So I've run ads trying to supporting even when he was at rebel so he could try to build
[24:28.760 --> 24:31.600]  a studio and get some crew and get some better equipment, you see that now.
[24:31.600 --> 24:35.400]  So we've been quietly behind the scenes trying to support Mr. Robinson with running his ads
[24:35.400 --> 24:41.960]  and things but now I'm just going to say this here on air, we have brought in less capital
[24:41.960 --> 24:45.520]  this year than we brought in last year and that's because people think, oh well the
[24:45.520 --> 24:47.480]  election's over, we're winning.
[24:47.480 --> 24:52.520]  So we're in a sudden death overtime, ladies and gentlemen with the Globals right now,
[24:52.520 --> 24:58.080]  this is maximum energy, maximum focus or they're going to win.
[24:58.080 --> 25:02.680]  So we've got specials that are so big, Frugey was showing me the numbers while I was talking
[25:02.680 --> 25:08.080]  to him last night, our head of operations and he said yes, we're selling way more product
[25:08.080 --> 25:16.040]  boss but you said 80% off, we're losing money on stuff, 80% off.
[25:16.040 --> 25:23.360]  So he said can we end the special today because it's not making but about 5%, he goes yes,
[25:23.360 --> 25:26.760]  way more money came in but it's all cost.
[25:26.760 --> 25:32.520]  So I give you deals so good that we're making 5% right now.
[25:32.520 --> 25:36.440]  Prebotic fibers are brand new products, going to sell out, incredible, it's best sourced
[25:36.440 --> 25:40.600]  fiber, 50% off, that's close to the cost.
[25:40.600 --> 25:46.120]  So M4WarsTour.com, M4WarsLife.com because I don't really get with math and come up
[25:46.120 --> 25:49.280]  with calculations and things, I just kind of say do this, do that and sometimes I overdo
[25:49.280 --> 25:50.280]  it.
[25:50.280 --> 25:53.880]  But I let everybody go to M4WarsTour.com and get the products and these sales are ending
[25:53.880 --> 25:57.080]  today, I'm going to have some new sales tomorrow and we're going to launch a new product as
[25:57.080 --> 26:03.840]  well but I want to expand and that's why they are the Communist Party suing us and CNN is
[26:03.840 --> 26:07.240]  trying to take responses and get a shut off YouTube as you all see and you know they've
[26:07.240 --> 26:11.840]  got the pet-pay-the-frog guy who said use it, use it to the daily dot and everybody
[26:11.840 --> 26:16.480]  else and we sell somebody's third party poster and then they sue us, it's totally frivolous.
[26:16.480 --> 26:22.440]  We're going to have to sue them with anti-slapback provisions, it's a total open and shut but
[26:22.440 --> 26:24.520]  it'll cost 100 grand.
[26:24.520 --> 26:29.080]  Then I got to sue him and he's got Democratic Party funding him but I have to beat him to
[26:29.080 --> 26:30.080]  set the precedent.
[26:30.080 --> 26:31.720]  So I've got to sue all these people.
[26:31.720 --> 26:35.360]  I mean this is like the Alamo, I'm sending a letter out, I need reinforcements, I'm going
[26:35.360 --> 26:39.360]  to stay here, we're going to fight, we're going to move forward, we're doing okay but
[26:39.360 --> 26:47.120]  you know we're moving by our basic inertia but we need your prayers, we need your support.
[26:47.120 --> 26:53.240]  We've got the poster, it was for $19.95 or I think $17.76, we boosted it to $29.95 because
[26:53.240 --> 26:55.920]  you know this is the thing they're trying to shut down, if I get an injunction ahead
[26:55.920 --> 27:00.920]  of the court case I'll stop selling it but we buy it from a known artist and it's just
[27:00.920 --> 27:08.160]  got about 5% of the surface is Pepe the Frog, it's transformative, it's like saying you
[27:08.160 --> 27:12.040]  know Hitler could say I have a copy right on my image and in Nazi Germany he did stuff
[27:12.040 --> 27:15.040]  like that and sue people that use his image unauthorized.
[27:15.040 --> 27:18.000]  You're allowed to paint something whether you love it or whether you hate it or whether
[27:18.000 --> 27:22.880]  you have mixed feelings about it and it's just got diamonds and silk and Matt Drudge
[27:22.880 --> 27:29.440]  and Paul Watson and you know people like that, Roger Stone and then it's got Pepe, like
[27:29.440 --> 27:32.840]  oh here's people, we feel like they're in the campaign, well they're saying well you
[27:32.840 --> 27:37.680]  can't use that, well it's totally protected but that's the crap I'm dealing with and look
[27:37.680 --> 27:41.800]  I expect this, I mean quite frankly they might send a hit team down here next week to get
[27:41.800 --> 27:45.320]  me because they know none of this is working, oh and by the way that's another big thing,
[27:45.320 --> 27:50.720]  I'm not being a drama queen about this, this is such a big deal that we can all play chess
[27:50.720 --> 27:55.240]  here can't we, we can play third dimensional, fourth dimensional, fifth dimensional, evil
[27:55.240 --> 27:58.320]  you know doesn't care, it tries to play one dimensional and can't even do that, it thinks
[27:58.320 --> 28:03.560]  because it wrecks everything, it must be powerful and have all the answers, I'm not stupid and
[28:03.560 --> 28:09.600]  this type of demonization campaign is almost always in the lead up to someone being assassinated
[28:09.600 --> 28:13.600]  or imprisoned and the left keeps coming up to me and airports are damn it going, you're
[28:13.600 --> 28:18.720]  going to prison and they think like, I'm like them a coward that I go oh my gosh I better
[28:18.720 --> 28:22.760]  roll over to a bunch of you that want to put me in prison, you're so authoritarian and
[28:22.760 --> 28:27.000]  you want to shut me off and I'll say I've got some videos of this and you want to shut
[28:27.000 --> 28:30.120]  me off YouTube, yes I do, I'm going to shut you off and they go and we're going to put
[28:30.120 --> 28:34.320]  you in prison and I go but you're for free speech, oh yes I'm for free speech, it's
[28:34.320 --> 28:40.240]  all double things scrambled so we're going to fight here but we need you to really aggressively
[28:40.240 --> 28:42.800]  so we can decide who we're going to hire, what we're going to do, I've been in a holding
[28:42.800 --> 28:48.000]  pattern to be flooded with capital, infowarstore.com, infowarslife.com or triple eight two five

[30:01.560 --> 30:05.560]  Just recently started using your products, everything you said about them is correct,

[30:28.040 --> 30:32.560]  off to the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, they've got a ton of money there.
[30:32.560 --> 30:38.280]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet and then concentrated or
[30:38.280 --> 30:43.480]  maximum potency, they want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover
[30:43.480 --> 30:47.400]  that up for a while but then burn you out in my experience whereas stuff that gets your

[31:34.360 --> 31:39.360]  Life products, they are quality, I can't wait to get some more and thank you so much for
[31:39.360 --> 31:41.280]  doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[31:41.280 --> 31:42.280]  Absolutely.
[31:42.280 --> 31:48.280]  Because then we could all as educated patriots help our other countrymen and women understand
[31:48.280 --> 31:52.840]  that there's a bigger problems going on and if we can get our houses in order and be good
[31:52.840 --> 32:00.520]  to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[32:00.520 --> 32:06.840]  I'm so excited, the new product at InfoWarsLife.com, in a glass bottle, two month servings filled
[32:06.840 --> 32:11.640]  to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[32:11.640 --> 32:17.080]  This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but
[32:17.080 --> 32:20.000]  boy does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[32:20.000 --> 32:26.280]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients
[32:26.280 --> 32:32.520]  but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae
[32:32.520 --> 32:37.720]  and I came up with our own formulae working with scientists and developers, non-GMO, made
[32:37.720 --> 32:44.280]  right here in America, 120 capsules and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone to it
[32:44.280 --> 32:48.800]  which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the
[32:48.800 --> 32:53.320]  hormones in your glands, it is amazing.
[32:53.320 --> 33:05.800]  Good pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com and your purchase fugs the operation.
[33:23.320 --> 33:51.280]  But we're waiting for them, we're not coming for them, we're waiting, trying to raise our
[33:51.280 --> 33:58.040]  families, trying to teal the fields, trying to keep our eye on God, trying to be good
[33:58.040 --> 34:09.360]  in this world of unbelievable wickedness, born into a war, an interdimensional, interplanetary
[34:09.360 --> 34:16.160]  psychic spiritual war and the greatest trick of the enemy is that the average person doesn't
[34:16.160 --> 34:17.160]  know it.
[34:17.160 --> 34:23.760]  You realize that's what's going on, then everything makes sense and the enemy is constantly
[34:23.760 --> 34:29.640]  ridiculing it, constantly saying it's not going on, there is no God but in their private
[34:29.640 --> 34:33.520]  circles, in fact I forgot, I did a report on it this weekend, you guys put me to see
[34:33.520 --> 34:38.520]  an article about the Satanism controversy in the Hillary campaign where they're trying
[34:38.520 --> 34:43.840]  to paper over that and they're saying Bravadovich and Hillary and Podesta, why they're not a
[34:43.840 --> 34:45.920]  cultist, it's art.
[34:45.920 --> 34:51.560]  The woman is the high priestess of Alistair Crowley Church, the most prominent one in
[34:51.560 --> 35:02.800]  the world, sexual, ritual, magic, watch CNN reports on controversial Satanism inside the
[35:02.800 --> 35:10.800]  Clinton campaign, there it is, there's a CNN article that tries to paper over it, I mean
[35:10.800 --> 35:16.880]  you can look at Hillary and see that she is completely turned over, there it is, senior
[35:16.880 --> 35:21.320]  advisor at HUD spread conspiracy theory that Clinton campaign chairman was Satanist and
[35:21.320 --> 35:25.960]  they go, it's been completely debunked that John Podesta ever was involved in anything,
[35:25.960 --> 35:34.040]  yes he hung out with Bravadovich, she's an artist, people in vats of blood and goat heads
[35:34.040 --> 35:40.280]  and she told Reddit ask me anything, no, these are real rituals, yeah lady, we know.
[35:40.280 --> 35:50.760]  We know all about it, I know all about it sweetheart, every stinking bit, all of it,
[35:50.760 --> 35:59.080]  I've been down the rat hole lady, I've seen it, further down than any of you have been,
[35:59.080 --> 36:06.600]  in spirit not in the flesh and they're trying to claw as many of us down with them because
[36:06.600 --> 36:16.120]  they already know they are spiritually dead, ooh that smell, what's that smell, the sound
[36:16.120 --> 36:26.400]  of death, the smell of death, the feel of death, it surrounds you, ooh that smell, can't
[36:26.400 --> 36:39.920]  you smell that smell, it's unbelievable, let me just do this to be a good boy, let me just
[36:39.920 --> 36:44.080]  read people some headlines here, I think that's probably what we should do, I've got so many
[36:44.080 --> 36:57.840]  clips and so much news, let's just start with this one, Trump's having the time of his life
[36:57.840 --> 37:05.880]  and he's re-announced his election for 2020, he's announced his slogan, keep America great,
[37:05.880 --> 37:09.200]  who can say we haven't begun to turn the corner, that's why they're fighting so hard because
[37:09.200 --> 37:19.440]  now people know it was all artificial suppressing us and they don't know what to do because
[37:19.440 --> 37:22.920]  they told us he didn't really want to run, he didn't really want to win, all those lies
[37:22.920 --> 37:30.160]  and everybody knows it's a lie, they know it's fake news and so as Trump goes into year
[37:30.160 --> 37:42.720]  number two they are in full chicken with a head cut off mode and they are apoplectic at
[37:42.720 --> 37:54.080]  this point and so they've segwayed away from get the guns for now to stormy Daniels, never
[37:54.080 --> 38:02.360]  anything about Oprah and the child prostitution and all the rest of it, nothing about her
[38:02.360 --> 38:06.000]  and Weinstein bringing women to him, nothing about all the rapes in the backs of vehicles
[38:06.000 --> 38:10.160]  and Hillary representing child molesters and making jokes about it and I mean you know
[38:10.160 --> 38:14.200]  seven guys gang raping an 11 year old girl they grabbed off the bike till her insides
[38:14.200 --> 38:19.840]  came out, didn't even know you could do that, I did some medical research and found out
[38:19.840 --> 38:27.280]  ISIS raped a little girl aged six to death over 100 men, same deal and of course Hillary
[38:27.280 --> 38:31.760]  helped them take over, it's like a spirit, you're like how does she do it, it always
[38:31.760 --> 38:38.160]  is, it ends in little girls and their guts coming out on the pavement and guys eating
[38:38.160 --> 38:43.640]  hearts and screaming Allah Akbar, it just always ends the same, that's who she represents,
[38:43.640 --> 38:48.440]  whether it's rich hillbillies raping some girl almost to death or jihadi hillbillies
[38:48.440 --> 38:52.920]  raping little girls to death, it's just that Hillary produces raped little girls with their
[38:52.920 --> 38:59.040]  insides coming out on the ground because that's what the demon that runs her likes, little
[38:59.040 --> 39:05.120]  girls getting tortured to death, that's Hillary folks, torture little girls to death, that's
[39:05.120 --> 39:09.320]  a lot of spirit little girls, a lot of soul and that's what that vampire likes, that's
[39:09.320 --> 39:14.720]  what that vampire gets, these little girls begging for their mommies over two, three
[39:14.720 --> 39:20.360]  days with a line of 100 slobs raping them till their guts come out and that's why they
[39:20.360 --> 39:27.160]  don't like me because I know who they are, I see you witch, hell is waiting for you
[39:27.160 --> 39:33.360]  and prepared and I will never falter or waver in your face, I will continue on no matter
[39:33.360 --> 39:39.720]  what you do, we will break your will and your God Satan is already broken and already defeated
[39:39.720 --> 39:48.680]  and Jesus Christ has the keys to hell and death, you are bound, you are defeated and
[39:48.680 --> 39:56.880]  you know it, our commitment has never been stronger, our will has never been stronger,
[39:56.880 --> 40:05.880]  our spirit has never been stronger because we contend not against flesh and blood but
[40:05.880 --> 40:16.120]  principalities and high places, the power of the air, that's what it is ladies and
[40:16.120 --> 40:18.480]  gentlemen, you're like well I don't like the churches, they're corrupt, of course the
[40:18.480 --> 40:23.680]  enemy takes that over first and you look at these people, that's why they make jokes
[40:23.680 --> 40:32.560]  about it, why Obama made jokes because they are devil worshipers, let me explain it again,
[40:32.560 --> 40:43.360]  they are devil worshipers and as soon as you get that through your head, there's a headline,
[40:43.360 --> 40:48.920]  how Hillary Clinton met Satan, New York Times, yeah remember Chelsea just wears upside down
[40:48.920 --> 41:04.000]  crosses, necklaces and upside down crosses, stuff just said be cool, it's just cool, it's
[41:04.000 --> 41:12.080]  cool, it's fine, it's about them selfishness, it's all about how powerful they are when
[41:12.080 --> 41:17.640]  they come in that room and that door opens and that little kid is chained up begging
[41:17.640 --> 41:28.080]  for money, that makes them feel real big, that makes them feel real powerful because
[41:28.080 --> 41:35.800]  they've already chosen destruction, they want to claws down into that hell with them and
[41:35.800 --> 41:42.160]  they know hell's real, they have some weird twisted idea that with computers and machines
[41:42.160 --> 41:47.440]  that they're gonna block death and that they're gonna turn to this new beautiful thing, they're
[41:47.440 --> 41:53.000]  gonna come from being a little vampire, stinking rotten meat slugs and they're gonna metamorphosize
[41:53.000 --> 42:00.760]  into a beautiful butterfly and flap off into the beautiful void of the deep blue space.
[42:00.760 --> 42:10.920]  But first, if you like Bernie Sanders, you gotta dominate things because as you get rid
[42:10.920 --> 42:16.440]  of all those things out there that are smart and hard working, then you can be a real boy
[42:16.440 --> 42:26.920]  like Bernie with the power, Sanders, we are so close to getting these questions right
[42:26.920 --> 42:31.880]  where we want them, you think we pulled it in Russia or honeymoons, all these American
[42:31.880 --> 42:38.320]  questions, we're gonna string them up and then I'm gonna be big, I'm gonna be in charge,
[42:38.320 --> 42:48.560]  hail Satan, I'm Bernie Sanders and Satan approves my little demonic message, you'll all drown
[42:48.560 --> 42:56.120]  in lakes of your own destructive creation, we'll be back as we break their will, stay
[42:56.120 --> 42:59.840]  with us.

[45:04.680 --> 45:09.400]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[45:09.400 --> 45:10.920]  to detoxify the body.
[45:10.920 --> 45:15.800]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.

[46:42.800 --> 46:46.400]  The liberal establishment media has controlled the narrative for too long.
[46:46.400 --> 46:49.520]  The silent majority is no longer silent.
[46:49.520 --> 47:04.120]  This is The War Room.
[47:04.120 --> 47:11.120]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.

[47:24.120 --> 47:31.120]  front lines of the info war.
[47:31.120 --> 47:35.240]  Let me illustrate what's going on and I know most of you know more than I what's going
[47:35.240 --> 47:41.520]  on but for the new listeners there's a story on infowars.com by Paul Joseph Watson there's
[47:41.520 --> 47:49.120]  also one from Breitbart and it deals with the fact that Twitter censored Drudge Tweet
[47:49.120 --> 47:58.320]  of Trump 2020 slogan as sensitive material so I'm sitting there with my family in a restaurant
[47:58.320 --> 48:03.200]  at about eight o'clock at night in Colorado on Saturday night getting ready to fly back
[48:03.200 --> 48:14.960]  to Austin the next day and Drudge tweeted keep America great and Kit Daniels texted
[48:14.960 --> 48:20.280]  me and said hey I just put this article out he just announced as I was walking my dog
[48:20.280 --> 48:29.200]  and was listening to local radio and heard the announcement come over that a speech he
[48:29.200 --> 48:33.280]  gave and I said well great good job writing your blurb so I looked it up and thought this
[48:33.280 --> 48:39.520]  is a great article let me tweet at real Alex Jones what he wrote and infowars.com and I
[48:39.520 --> 48:43.960]  noticed I tried to send it out twice and it would go to drafts and it wasn't too long
[48:43.960 --> 48:49.480]  it was short and then I sent out another tweet about something else and it went through and
[48:49.480 --> 48:57.840]  I did it again and they weren't letting me say Trump announces new campaign slogan but
[48:57.840 --> 49:03.120]  instead of just blocking it like they did with Drudge they said this is inappropriate
[49:03.120 --> 49:11.000]  material and blocked it the screenshots of that they just wouldn't let me tweet it and
[49:11.000 --> 49:15.520]  it was basically word for word keep America great Trump announces his slogan same thing
[49:15.520 --> 49:23.760]  Drudge said and like I said I did it at like eight o'clock call Colorado time he did it
[49:23.760 --> 49:29.880]  I think Eastern time but the point is there it is and I guess that got too obvious so
[49:29.880 --> 49:33.640]  we I canvas some other folks I know that were trying to tweet it so they said yeah ours went
[49:33.640 --> 49:40.160]  to draft so this was too obvious Drudge did it right when Trump announced it so they just
[49:40.160 --> 49:45.520]  blocked that and said you're not allowed to see that this is racist violent homophobic
[49:45.520 --> 49:49.360]  whatever excuse they've got I mean that's what it says you know in their terms that
[49:49.360 --> 49:52.680]  when they do this it's something horrible and all it was and here's our president he
[49:52.680 --> 49:56.240]  announced his new campaign slogan oh my gosh this is sensitive material you can't see it
[49:56.240 --> 50:04.360]  but two hours later eight o'clock mountain time it just goes to drafts in fact I sent
[50:04.360 --> 50:09.240]  it to Paul this morning to add to the article he says he's adding it now so you can see
[50:09.240 --> 50:12.520]  that he just responded to me I guess he had missed it but screenshot please or document
[50:12.520 --> 50:16.760]  him shot I'll show you here because I saved the drafts here it is failed to send Trump
[50:16.760 --> 50:22.760]  just announced his new 2020 campaign slogan and I said well it didn't work we video Trump
[50:22.760 --> 50:29.360]  just announces 2020 campaign slogan and the great part is it's true so see here's how
[50:29.360 --> 50:33.960]  this works you blocked me on Twitter but I still got it out on my own streams my own
[50:33.960 --> 50:39.560]  video streams and our hundreds of radio affiliates and now over a hundred TV affiliates but they're
[50:39.560 --> 50:45.160]  doing it and it's everywhere our own president and think about all the Republican Congress
[50:45.160 --> 50:50.760]  people who have their campaign ads on their own Twitter blocked for inappropriate they
[50:50.760 --> 50:55.680]  just banned them blocked their channels who's the Congresswoman from Tennessee was like
[50:55.680 --> 50:59.840]  this really here's my family and my grandchildren I believe in American values and free market
[50:59.840 --> 51:04.320]  capitalism I believe in tax cuts the second amendment and they just banned her saying
[51:04.320 --> 51:12.680]  inappropriate because to an SJW a woman with kids and grandkids I've noticed left us everywhere
[51:12.680 --> 51:19.000]  march over and make mean comments about my family I had it happen three times in Colorado
[51:19.000 --> 51:24.040]  and of course we got mobbed by listeners and patriots every race color and creed a lot
[51:24.040 --> 51:32.280]  of listeners lot especially young people they had the tunnel was closed the Eisenhower slash
[51:32.280 --> 51:42.360]  LBJ tunnel was closed because it was a pile up we were going back to Denver to fly out
[51:42.360 --> 51:47.680]  and because of a blizzard beautiful blizzard couldn't see 500 feet in front of you and
[51:47.680 --> 51:51.320]  I finally had like an hour I said let's get out of the car and walk around nobody wanted
[51:51.320 --> 51:56.720]  to get out well I got out and I walked around look over the side big vista down there frozen
[51:56.720 --> 52:02.440]  lake you name it and all of a sudden everybody should get down with their cars and my phone
[52:02.440 --> 52:05.480]  was I must hurt videotapes because it just shows how we're winning and why they're so
[52:05.480 --> 52:12.160]  scared out of all five or six cars around me people got out and it was all young men
[52:12.160 --> 52:18.520]  and women college age because there were you know trucks and workers and other people
[52:18.520 --> 52:25.320]  and there were lots of you know Subaru's and the rest of it in Colorado they have a funny
[52:25.320 --> 52:30.080]  name for them they call them liberal limousines they have another name for them but the point
[52:30.080 --> 52:36.000]  is is that they're all we can't believe you're here well what are you doing what are you
[52:36.000 --> 52:42.080]  doing walking around in the snowstorm and I don't know why I'm going there it's just
[52:42.080 --> 52:46.680]  think about that because I don't want to talk about the negative and then distort the fact
[52:46.680 --> 52:54.800]  that ninety nine percent of it's positive but like a cult it's either older white women
[52:54.800 --> 52:58.800]  or it's gay men and I've got some video that happened the airport we're going to put out
[52:58.800 --> 53:05.840]  today of this as well and they walk down the plane and say haha you lost your family and
[53:05.840 --> 53:08.760]  my son sitting the seat back goes hey you got a problem because the guy was like bowing
[53:08.760 --> 53:12.600]  up videotaping me haha you lost your family I'm sitting there with my children all four
[53:12.600 --> 53:16.960]  of my children and my wife and I'm like okay you see them said where Jones doesn't have
[53:16.960 --> 53:21.640]  his children Jones believes there's Mars basis again it's not about me it's understanding
[53:21.640 --> 53:28.000]  their psychology so then we see the guy at baggage claim I talked to him nice he says
[53:28.000 --> 53:37.120]  I deserve to be in prison I don't deserve to have free speech and then I get a text message
[53:37.120 --> 53:41.480]  and so it stops my recording and then when that stopped I'm getting the bags my son starts
[53:41.480 --> 53:47.480]  going with his bag out of the baggage area and the two gay guys who are pretty big guys
[53:47.480 --> 53:51.120]  my son's pretty big he's already like six foot one he's already about two inches taller
[53:51.120 --> 53:59.040]  than me he looks like he's about 18 but he's he's 15 they come over and say want to throw
[53:59.040 --> 54:05.040]  down and these were kind of like jockey gay guys you know they it wasn't you know your
[54:05.040 --> 54:10.560]  archetypal you know things the media pushes all their shows like a you know sissy or whatever
[54:10.560 --> 54:15.240]  and then I'd already been coming in and seen a guy used to work out with a military guy
[54:15.240 --> 54:18.000]  and when he did that that guy goes you want to fight let's go to them and they backed
[54:18.000 --> 54:23.440]  off it was just like Antifa where we have the footage time for wars dot com of a female
[54:23.440 --> 54:30.120]  reporter middle aged and can Antifa showing up police directed clearly at a McDonald's
[54:30.120 --> 54:35.840]  where Tommy Robinson is and start viciously beating her and attacking him and he fights
[54:35.840 --> 54:42.960]  them off and they run after like a five minute fight and the police are all watching and
[54:42.960 --> 54:51.640]  it's the same thing these guys both weighed about 200 pounds they were all his boyfriend
[54:51.640 --> 54:56.480]  was about six one he was he was about five five eleven stocking like I was and they had
[54:56.480 --> 55:01.040]  all their sports gear they were about both of them are about 30 and he wasn't about
[55:01.040 --> 55:07.360]  to say throw down with me he went and said F your family and my wife saw it she got upset
[55:07.360 --> 55:14.880]  by it he would F your family see it they didn't like that I had a family and those of us aren't
[55:14.880 --> 55:18.320]  dialed into this we don't understand it and I'm not saying all gay people are like that
[55:18.320 --> 55:23.760]  the point is and before they left him and my phone stopped because my text to me he's
[55:23.760 --> 55:29.480]  like he's like you're bullying downtrodden people that can't be any more bullied and
[55:29.480 --> 55:33.280]  then somebody texted me in the phone quit going and I was like man dude you just flew

[55:59.200 --> 56:04.120]  minute conversation and then all of a sudden I look over and they're past the gate deal
[56:04.120 --> 56:07.320]  starting a fight with my son and I talk to people I said what are they saying they just
[56:07.320 --> 56:12.360]  ran over them and said you want to throw down because I guess he went back over to his boyfriend
[56:12.360 --> 56:19.320]  and they were mad that that I was nice or something I mean it's it's crazy I watched

[01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:33.600]  corruption crashing through the lines and disinformation i'm your host alex jones you
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:38.240]  know i should have opened the show with this fact on the live streams it's one of the headlines
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:47.960]  we put out this morning jelena signs warns that leftist funded cia agents are planning
[01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:53.560]  on throwing the 2018 election and he has that from all the secret intel he's being given
[01:00:53.560 --> 01:01:02.000]  by patriots and that's why i'm saying it's time for covert action legally and lawfully
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:07.080]  by the president because these groups are working for foreign foundations they're getting
[01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:11.640]  foreign outside campaign money and for some reason the republicans always roll over and
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:16.520]  let the democrats prosecute everybody with fake stuff and you know put filmmakers in
[01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:19.800]  jail because they got five friends to give donations to somebody running for hillary
[01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:27.360]  senate seat tenacity susan and then she can get billions dollars from foreign governments
[01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:32.280]  and dictators and use it for a campaign at that foundation i mean she can get hundreds
[01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:37.280]  of millions of dollars from the russians imagine if trump did something like that so
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:47.200]  i'm gonna talk about that in the next segment ex spook clapper clap on clap off the clapper
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:52.360]  celebrates five years since lying to congress as statute of limitations expires he said

[01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:26.360]  where I'm it's nineteen ninety nine I'm on meet the press a show now headed by sleepy
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:37.360]  eyes chuck Todd he's a sleeping son of a bitch I'll tell you
[01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:43.080]  they showed it this morning nineteen ninety nine and I'm talking about North Korea you
[01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:48.880]  got to take them out now and then they have clinton saying we are pleased to announce that
[01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:52.760]  we have made a deal with North Korea well you know how that deal turned out right their
[01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:58.880]  nuclear weapons and billions of dollars and lots of other things but now North Korea has
[01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:04.440]  already agreed to no more missile tests conditionally for the meeting and to abandon their nuclear
[01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:09.000]  weapons program and they agree to a lot more behind the scenes and notice I told you that
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:14.520]  last week the day after it was announced and then now it's in the news that North Korea
[01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:21.720]  has already tacitly agreed Trump doesn't go to that meeting without the agreement and
[01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:28.560]  so we can't be embarrassed the South Koreans have written memorandums that can be released
[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:36.160]  give Kim Jong-un or a niggs this won't be the UN run inspectors my friends because the
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:45.800]  globalist through Mao Zedong stage that whole war to sap our military and to test that very
[01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:52.600]  sophisticated full spectrum dominance of staged wars oh our troops died and the Chinese died
[01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:59.760]  over a million and a half of them that's pretty good numbers you know we lose a hundred thousand
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:04.960]  and something they lose a couple million but see we weren't allowed to stop them because
[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:10.880]  we were never meant to stop them because of again our little friend the globalist little
[01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:20.240]  corrupt piece of garbage little mobster carry as Truman and the military wanted to have
[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:27.520]  a coup against him and have MacArthur be an interim president and have elections but MacArthur
[01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:36.880]  said that we would just dig in and battle on that way long term as the American people
[01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:45.600]  would never accept a communist plan for the US sometimes I wish MacArthur would have just
[01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:49.880]  defeated the globalist here knocked out the communist Chinese at the CIA just put in power
[01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:59.080]  two years before they invaded five years before the armistice in July of 53 and if you understand
[01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:05.800]  North Korea you understand everything now I'm gonna play this vice report that's basically
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:10.840]  nothing but clips of my show and the last time I did it they put a strike on our channel

[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:26.560]  law center in the ADL and media matters and the Nazi collaborators or Soros have put out
[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:32.040]  where they show days before I say something and then Trump says it days later now that's
[01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:36.480]  because Trump's seeing the same thing I'm seeing and seeing what the grassroots is seeing
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:42.200]  and just going with the common knowledge of the group research in a few cases I did have
[01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:45.440]  conversations with him and pointed things out and then he went and looked it up or already
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:51.280]  knew about it in the case of election theft and immigration and you know things like that
[01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:56.560]  but he has a lot of the same people he's talking to aka you know all the news about CIA officers
[01:10:56.560 --> 01:11:02.480]  flooding a democratic party to steal the midterm election so that's coming up but here's vice
[01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:08.800]  when we come back from break because I don't think I have time now 11 times Donald Trump
[01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:16.440]  sounded a lot like Alex Jones and they just regurgitate this thing over and over again
[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:23.200]  as if that's something discrediting him but see the psychology here is they know that it's
[01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:30.280]  actually powerful info that defeats them so they play this appeal to authority scam where
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:37.680]  they go we are the arbiters of truth and we say this is very discrediting there are no
[01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:43.480]  illegals voting anywhere and there's no plan of democrats to in 14 different states and
[01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:48.360]  counting it's more now to legalize illegals getting driver's license and being able to
[01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:55.440]  vote and then I can go show you hundreds of clips and newspapers in Illinois and in Vermont
[01:11:55.440 --> 01:12:04.000]  and in California and in Oregon and just where they said just type it in California legalizes
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:08.720]  giving illegals driver's license letting them vote and then they say we're organizing and
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:14.720]  illegal should be able to vote and they've passed laws in Illinois and California it's
[01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:18.960]  gotten to the governor's desk and they haven't been bold enough to sign them legalizing illegals
[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:25.480]  voting but anybody can type that in California opens driver's license applications illegal
[01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:34.600]  immigrants those want to say they will allow them to vote again they just say oh Trump
[01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:38.720]  made it up you know there weren't three million people that voted legally and it's not even
[01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:44.480]  really mainly illegals because what they found is the illegals don't want to go vote they
[01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:47.720]  don't feel like they're supposed to and they know it's wrong so they mainly get homeless
[01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:51.680]  people some of them are illegals and they are mentally ill people and they go and they
[01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:55.600]  get them to vote on average 10 times project Veritas caught it all on tape it's come out
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:13:07.080]  in federal court it's incredible the Democrats lobby just type in state bill legalizes migrants
[01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:11.080]  voting is the headline same thing in Europe and they've got all these cities where it's
[01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:14.800]  going on so once they tell the illegals hey it's okay it's the law then they do it that's
[01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:23.400]  the mayor and the governor and Oakland and California saying to illegals why if ice comes
[01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:27.480]  you don't have to open the door or follow their warrants or and so then you see this
[01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:32.800]  viral video we should pull it up over the weekend headline was mother you know in front
[01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:39.560]  of crying children you know a migrant grabbed and kidnapped by ice and it says in the arrest
[01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:44.960]  document and in the warrant that she's a known smuggler from this place to this house and
[01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:50.160]  they've raided a house for all these people and that she ships him in that's all in the
[01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:55.400]  actual document that AP mentioned but nowhere and then it says all her children were left
[01:13:55.400 --> 01:14:00.640]  here in the United States it's just now why is the woman fighting because the governor
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:06.400]  told her did and the mayor told her to now we're about to go to break let's back it up
[01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:12.920]  where she's crying and so this is the theater now do you know who's killed the most Mexicans
[01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:18.200]  per capita in the last 20 years of anybody it's admitted I've had professors on it's
[01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:23.920]  documented you know who kills the most Mexicans and others it's called the coyotes it's called

[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:34.400]  them children dead because somebody didn't pay the extra money the smugglers chained
[01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:39.040]  it up in the middle of the summer heat usually it's San Antonio's the dumping point somebody
[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:43.560]  doesn't pay the local Mexican mafia of the city council members that's the catch city

[01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:51.760]  you get swept in the rug it's a big racket somebody doesn't pay so they put a padlock
[01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:56.360]  on there in the hundred degree heat and then they open it up and they're not even human
[01:14:56.360 --> 01:15:00.760]  to the media it's like alright other 18 wheeler every few weeks you hear about other 18 wheeler

[01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:40.320]  i'm saying let's go ahead and go to this report i keep talking about where they again say
[01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:44.480]  that trump is copying everything i say no he's seeing the same thing happening but yes
[01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:49.000]  some of the information i have challenged him and sent him messages and he's watched
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:52.000]  he's called about it before and they make a big deal about like it's discrediting the
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.960]  president again like they control reality so they go oh this is all discredited it's
[01:23:55.960 --> 01:24:00.280]  all come true it's all been proven the illegals voting all of it so again that's what we're
[01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:03.720]  winning that's what they're losing here is 11 times Donald Trump sound a lot like Alex
[01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:14.560]  Jones from vice it is surreal to talk about issues here on air and then word for word
[01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:22.400]  here trumps say it two days later is a front man a figurehead his real name is Barry Sotaro
[01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:29.160]  and that was his name and he changed his name to Barack Hussein Obama the newest Obama birth
[01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:34.480]  certificate that's been released by the White House has been altered in literally dozens
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:41.920]  of ways a lot of people do not think it was an authentic certificate reported well but
[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:49.120]  many people do not think it was authentic he also again wears a ring that has islamic
[01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:55.240]  arabic script on it he's wearing a muslim ring and then trump was a muslim well this
[01:24:55.240 --> 01:25:00.440]  is incredible one of our investigative journalist a few weeks ago broke it was cruises father
[01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:04.920]  linked the JFK assassination Cuban hired by Lee Harvey Oswald bears striking resemblance
[01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:12.240]  to cruise his father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald being you know shot I mean
[01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:16.520]  the whole thing is ridiculous what what what is this right prior to his being shot as we
[01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:21.480]  have been saying for three years Hillary is the founder of ISIS along with Obama president
[01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:30.840]  Obama he is the founder of ISIS he's the founder of ISIS and I would say the co-founder
[01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:36.280]  would be crooked Hillary Clinton I said he's going to use executive orders to go after
[01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:40.800]  our guns now sure enough they're getting ready to do that the president's thinking about
[01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:45.000]  signing an executive order where he wants to take your guns away you hear this one
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:50.720]  pause Hillary Clinton back over a second Obama said he was looking at executive order to
[01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:55.960]  to confiscate guns the reason we're both saying it is because it's in the news so I love to
[01:25:55.960 --> 01:26:00.400]  take credit for this and some of it is my research information but it turns out it wasn't
[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:05.080]  three plus million people that voted the names of dead folks it was five plus million according
[01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:09.200]  to Harvard's own study that came out last year again but they just think because they
[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:14.560]  make fun of it then it must not be true and then the looms that watch this they believe
[01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:21.640]  it continue Hillary Clinton is a god damn demon she's the devil in California where
[01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:26.120]  they have farms up here and they don't get water by the way that's true oh that's too
[01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:29.920]  bad is that they're drought no we have plenty of water so what's wrong well we shove it
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:35.600]  out to see that's a fact I said why and nobody even knows why and the environmentalist don't
[01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:40.240]  know why now they're trying to protect a certain kind of three inch fish I think she's gonna
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:45.480]  show up and on drugs though she's gonna be whacked she's gonna be whacked so they were
[01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:51.560]  like why ain't I 50 pulling a hit I'm ready to debate I think we should take a drug test
[01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:56.560]  prior to the debate pause again back it up she's obviously bombed out of her brain on
[01:26:56.560 --> 01:27:02.560]  anti-seizure drugs. Again, but because we're right, that turns into we're wrong. Continue.
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:07.440]  Debate. I think we should take a drug test prior to the debate.
[01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:08.880]  I do.
[01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:12.640]  Alex Jones here with an extremely important message to Donald Trump.
[01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:16.160]  Crooked Hillary Clinton has openly stolen the nomination of Bernie Sanders.
[01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:22.560]  That's about making the issue of Hillary's election fraud in the primaries one of the central
[01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:27.920]  issues. If she stole the primary, she's going to try to steal the general election. Poor Bernie.
[01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:32.080]  First of all, it's rigged and I'm afraid the election is going to be rigged. I have to be honest.
[01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:39.920]  It is uncontrovertible fact that 3 million illegals voted and that tens of millions of people
[01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:44.000]  were on the voter rolls who were dead. And then he tweeted that 4 million of them
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:48.880]  voted as well. I just want to finish by saying your reputation is amazing. I will not let you
[01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:54.560]  down. You will be very, very impressed, I hope. And by the way, I want to tell the president,
[01:27:54.560 --> 01:28:00.720]  I'm not going to let him down. And the fact is that I told the president, as long as you
[01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:03.840]  try to execute the Constitution as best as you can, I know you're not a dictator,
[01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:08.080]  I'm going to support you. And he said, keep it up. Press the attack. We're going to win.
[01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:14.240]  And just know this, that this is the fight to restore our republic and you can feel the
[01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:19.440]  spirit rising. Can't you, Alex? And remember, I talked about those quotes. He never really
[01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:23.520]  talked about that. But now he talks about the spirit rising and the spirit of America coming
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:27.440]  back. Well, that's what he does behind the scenes. And for Trump, it's very spiritual. And by that,
[01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:32.720]  not through some preacher, but the energy force of America, of free market, of Christianity,
[01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:38.080]  of strength, he likes that. He doesn't like the weaseling devil worshipers. Trump's not a devil
[01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:44.000]  worshiper. He loves life. He loves his kids. He loves, he's got gusto. And you know, he's not
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:48.080]  perfect, but he loves life. And that's, that's enough, isn't it? He marches with pro-life. He's
[01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:53.520]  not a devil worshiper. Trump, not a devil worshiper, not out to get you. That's the secret. We don't
[01:28:53.520 --> 01:29:00.800]  worship death. It's a no brainer. A big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period. You

[01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:34.560]  By the way, the crew came in here at the start of the broadcast that came in here during the
[01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:38.640]  last break. They said, Alex, why are you not covering the top story on DrudgeReport.com,
[01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:47.120]  a second bombing in Austin, Texas of completely innocent targets, old ladies in northeast Austin.
[01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:54.720]  And I just get so focused on globalism and the big picture that I just feel was sad to hear this
[01:33:54.720 --> 01:33:58.080]  has happened. I hadn't really covered it, so I'm going to cover it now. Owen Schreuer is down there
[01:33:58.080 --> 01:34:04.160]  on the scene. Owen just always goes, doesn't need to direct him. I'm getting ready for my own show.
[01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:08.560]  Great. Let's send the camera crews with him. This is big. Send. We got camera crews to send
[01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:13.120]  people now. I guess I could go off air for a few minutes, because now that they reminded me this
[01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:18.320]  is going on, I'm like, yeah, we need to go cover this. We need to go live from the scene
[01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:23.920]  and then talk to folks and then get going on. So we're going to do that.
[01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:34.000]  Breaking. Woman injured in second explosion reported in Austin today. EMS says, that's out of the
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:38.320]  statesman. Emergency responders have been dispatched, and you know what it has to do with
[01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:42.080]  South by Southwest folks, so that somebody gets attention for that, to a second reported
[01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:48.960]  explosion in Austin on Monday. Medics were sent to the 6,700 block of the Lindo Street near
[01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:57.680]  Montopolis and East Riverside. This is like right here in the middle Austin in Southeast
[01:34:57.680 --> 01:35:01.120]  Austin. And then there's been another one in Northeast Austin. I guess Medics took a woman
[01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:05.760]  only described as her 70s to Dell Seaton Medical Center with serious potentially life-threatening
[01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:09.520]  injuries. Another one in their A's was being treated for an unrelated medical issue.
[01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:13.200]  The incident marks the second reported explosion in the city on Monday,
[01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:19.120]  and the third in two weeks. An explosion to the first one was attached weeks ago. An explosion
[01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:24.480]  earlier in the day at the 4,800 block of Old Fort Hill Drive in East Austin killed 17-year-old
[01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:28.400]  an injured woman described in her 40s. Hours after the incident, interim police chief
[01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:35.440]  Brian Manley said the explosion appeared similar and likely related to another explosion in
[01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:40.560]  Northeast Austin on March 2. The Ides of March. Authorities on Monday also warned residents
[01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:44.000]  against taking suspicious packages inside their homes. The incidents are being investigated by
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:49.040]  police and federal authorities and homicide the chief said. That's two bombings today and one back
[01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:59.200]  on March 2 a week ago. And I don't know who's behind it, but I know that when we're going to
[01:35:59.200 --> 01:36:02.080]  my cat, I was about massive censorship. This is critical coming up to the moment. He's busy
[01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:04.560]  on a business trip, but I twist his arm to come on because this is important. We're going to
[01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:10.880]  have him in a minute. This is breaking. Huffington Post ran stories last week as well as the local
[01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:20.000]  paper saying that violence by anti-gentrification groups is good. You guys pull that Huffington
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:24.880]  Post article up particularly. I think it's like anti-gentrification groups now, you know,
[01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:29.840]  now turning to violence. And it says in the article, I texted it to you Darryl over the weekend,
[01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:35.040]  how good it is. It's like they're not going to take whites moving into their neighborhood kindly
[01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:40.160]  and then it's weird white liberal women, communist, leading the minorities. And then here in Austin,
[01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:46.240]  the Blue Cat Cafe had some little trailers in an empty parking lot with two liberal women that
[01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:57.040]  have a cat shelter and they come out and protest them and then put superglue in the locks so the
[01:36:57.040 --> 01:37:02.240]  cats couldn't be fed and knocked the windows out. And the statesman said it was good and the
[01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:07.840]  patch articles said, oh, Jones got involved, but you know, this gentrification is a problem. And
[01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:14.320]  now the city's going to pass a gentrification law of a right to return where if, I guess if
[01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:18.240]  you're white and you own a property, you have to go to the city now about who you can sell it to
[01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:26.720]  and for what so they can kind of mafia over it. And I mean, East Austin was about 80% black under
[01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:31.520]  Jim Crow laws, but just like East Texas family, I've got, it's a brain drain. Everybody goes to
[01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:37.280]  college or they move away and then crime and old folks are in the area and section eight housing.
[01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:41.920]  So the left gave itself all this money, hundreds of millions of dollars in Austin, they move in,
[01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:47.440]  they build it all up, they run it. Friends of the city council mafia make money and now they induce
[01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:52.960]  yuppies to move in and now they're going to have a white tax and it says Portland and other
[01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:59.920]  cities have this white tax and you pay it. It has nothing to do with displaced black people.
[01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:05.680]  By the way, it was the illegal aliens that displaced them. Anti gentrification protesters
[01:38:05.680 --> 01:38:11.520]  violent and East Austin. Yeah. Oh, it turns violent. And again, those are some of the articles,
[01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:17.040]  but can you put the Huffington Post one up their place? The Huffington Post comes out and says
[01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:21.680]  it's good that they're violent. A new generation of anti gentrification radicals are on the march
[01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:26.000]  in Los Angeles and around the country. And then it goes into how they're violent and how it's good.
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:30.560]  It says again, Austin, Texas, California, you name it. It listed all right there.
[01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:35.600]  And they're communists. They have communist flags that come out. They're led by rich white kids.
[01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:39.760]  And then they hit you over the head with clubs and the media says it's good.
[01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:46.240]  So is this an anti gentrification bombing? I don't know. I'm not saying that. That's just
[01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:53.520]  the violence being promoted. What we're seeing. I mean, these letters groups say if you see a white
[01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:59.440]  person mug them and you go, you know, that sounds crazy. You can't go into these hippie,
[01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:07.280]  dippy, yuppie areas now, um, in East Austin without somebody trying to mug you. And it's crazy.
[01:39:07.280 --> 01:39:13.200]  Anti fuzz all over there. Communist just thugs roaming around. And then all these idiot left
[01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:18.800]  us. It's even been on the news. They go, I'm gay. Why did the five black guys beat me up? I'm liberal.
[01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:25.280]  Those are clips on local Fox news and it's like, dude, you've been sent there to be the food in
[01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:32.880]  a social experiment. We're going to go to Mike Adams and come back from break. Uh, he had his
[01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:38.080]  YouTube channel with hundreds of millions of views deleted. The health ranger. I know his
[01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:42.000]  YouTube channel was six, seven, eight years old. At least that I knew some of our videos are on
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:48.400]  there with millions of views. It's just gone. He was told by executives at YouTube that will go
[01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:52.480]  unnamed that no, cause they were telling him why it was banned. They say you violated community
[01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:56.960]  standards. He had a video about how there are two genders. You see professors getting fired or
[01:39:56.960 --> 01:40:01.920]  getting censured and all this stuff. And again, it means you hate someone. If you're saying there,
[01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:05.680]  if you want to say you're another gender, that's fine. If you want to say you're a pink dragon or
[01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:08.720]  you're a golden dragon or you're a beautiful ornate building like Google executives do,
[01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:13.600]  if you want to say you're the Loch Ness monster in the Easter bunny or a flying purple people here,
[01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:19.360]  you can do that. I don't hate you. I don't hate people that think, you know, they're the pope
[01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:24.400]  when they're not. We usually call that mentally ill folks, but there are two genders. There are
[01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:29.360]  two different groups of chromosomes in male and female in every major species. So I understand
[01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:34.720]  they're trying to like make being heterosexual a bad thing. I mean, the left comes up in whole
[01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:38.000]  foods. I can't even go there. They'll say, how dare you have three, four children? Or they'll say,
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:43.200]  F your family or look at your gross family. And so it's, it's, it's, they're the radicals,
[01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:48.480]  they're the cult, they're the weirdos and the people beneath them, the left is adopting whatever
[01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:54.240]  the new radicalization is. So they've gone from left being anti-war and anti-torture or whatever
[01:40:55.760 --> 01:41:01.440]  to being anti-free speech, globalist, lock everybody up and let's go attack cat sanctuaries
[01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:05.360]  and let's hit people in the head with bike locks and let's do all this. So Mike Adams is coming up
[01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:11.680]  his YouTube band, ladies and gentlemen. Yeah, you can pull up the local news reports about the cat
[01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:16.560]  sanctuary vandalized. That's the, that's the article. And what's more important is you've got
[01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:21.600]  Huffington Post and the Austin America statesman saying it's good to go out and attack people.
[01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:27.760]  They just, you know, they tell the middle class and white people and others,
[01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:32.480]  gentrify, move in, help these folks, build it up. East Austin was like a wasteland. Every second
[01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:36.080]  house had nobody in it. I mean, it was like you drive down the roads, I'd see killings and stuff
[01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:40.080]  over there because access TV was based over there. I would see people on stretchers with,
[01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:48.880]  with blankets over there at least once a month. There were deaths every day. It was a hellhole.
[01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:51.520]  They've made it actually really nice and they've got all this affordable housing,
[01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:56.320]  but that's not what it was about. It was about then once you do that, you use the real liberals
[01:41:56.320 --> 01:42:00.480]  that mean well, try to bring wealth areas, you then call it gentrification and then you make
[01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:05.360]  everybody clash and then the other whites through in the area go under Stockholm syndrome and join
[01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:09.600]  the Antifa and the communist group to literally wear armbands and say, I hate white people,
[01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:13.600]  I'm in the club and the minorities are like, we're not into this, but it doesn't matter. The media
[01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:17.920]  covers it like that's what it's supposed to be. Totally sick. We're going to go to break,
[01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:21.840]  come back with Mike Adams. I've got an in free shipping today and the biggest sales ever,

[01:42:58.960 --> 01:43:03.360]  once said many years ago that if fascism ever comes to America, it'll come in the name of
[01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:14.000]  liberalism. You're a white male. You're a white man. Welcome to the war room, the latest expansion
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:20.880]  in info wars live broadcasting. We are live weekdays from three to six PM central at infowars.com
[01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:26.320]  slash show and this YouTube channel right here that you've landed on. Please subscribe to the
[01:43:26.320 --> 01:43:32.000]  channel for updates and notifications. You can follow us on Twitter at war room show. We are
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:36.640]  going to have the most powerful guests, the most powerful hosts will be hearing from Alex Jones
[01:43:36.640 --> 01:43:42.240]  regularly as well as taking your phone calls. The liberal establishment media has controlled
[01:43:42.240 --> 01:43:51.760]  the narrative for too long. The silent majority is no longer silent. This is the war room.
[01:43:57.520 --> 01:44:01.840]  Fuel your body with carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by info wars life.
[01:44:01.840 --> 01:44:06.320]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestive process and increase the bioavailability of
[01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:10.880]  nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components. They also help prevent
[01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:15.200]  discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:19.680]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age. Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like
[01:44:19.680 --> 01:44:25.120]  those naturally present in the body. Enjoy the full potential of protein rich foods again.
[01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:29.920]  You can eat protein heavy foods now while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort
[01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:35.120]  commonly associated with high meat diets. Just one pill with every high protein meal helps increase
[01:44:35.120 --> 01:44:39.680]  the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:45.040]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates,
[01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:49.040]  so you can fully digest all types of meals. Don't let a meal go to waste,
[01:44:49.040 --> 01:44:55.200]  use carnivore by info wars life. Head to info wars life dot com and secure your bottle now.
[01:44:55.200 --> 01:45:03.360]  That's info wars life dot com. Introducing cell force by info wars life. Cell force focuses on
[01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:09.280]  mitochondria efficiency and protection. Mitochondria produce over 95 percent of your energy.
[01:45:09.280 --> 01:45:14.320]  They are your body's cellular engines. Cell force helps promote your cellular energy
[01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:19.360]  production by supporting mitochondria, much like a cellular engine overhaul. Because when
[01:45:19.360 --> 01:45:24.320]  your mitochondria don't run at 100 percent efficiency, then they start producing reactive
[01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:30.640]  oxygen species. Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage,
[01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:36.640]  resulting from these reactive oxygen species. The antioxidants found in cell force are some
[01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:42.000]  of the most powerful available on the market. The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability
[01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:48.960]  to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals. Boost, protect, and adapt
[01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:57.840]  with cell force from info wars life. Head to info wars life dot com or call 1-888-253-3139.

[01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:24.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schreuer, host of the War Room, is live off of Montopolis,
[01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:29.040]  very close to our office's warehouse. Our broadcast studios are in a different area in
[01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:36.800]  central Austin, but our warehouse is in south Austin, near to the bombing. This is the third
[01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:43.760]  bombing, a second today, third since March 2nd. Again, Owen is live streaming right now on info
[01:47:43.760 --> 01:47:49.920]  wars dot com and news wars dot com. He is at the scene. There's just shots of FBI agents,
[01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:55.120]  you name it. We'll be talking to him next hour. Mr. Robinson, attacked by anti-poeficiously,
[01:47:55.120 --> 01:47:58.640]  incredibly incredible footage. That's coming up to give us the rest of the story next hour.
[01:47:58.640 --> 01:48:05.120]  But Mike Adams is on the road. He's a technology expert, the health ranger, so much more, a top
[01:48:05.120 --> 01:48:11.760]  programmer. He's meeting right now. He's left Austin. He's in another location about to launch
[01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:17.200]  his own big video platform because he was banned after hundreds of millions of views and many years
[01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:22.480]  on YouTube for saying there are two genders and having clips of professors and scientists saying
[01:48:22.480 --> 01:48:27.120]  that in mammals there are two genders. It doesn't hurt anybody that there are two genders. Like,
[01:48:27.120 --> 01:48:34.720]  does it hurt anybody that water boils at a certain temperature or thing or two plus two equals four?
[01:48:34.720 --> 01:48:39.120]  He was banned all part of this purge and thousands of channels have not been brought back. You put
[01:48:39.120 --> 01:48:43.280]  enough attention on info wars that our channel and others came back. Dr. Corsi came back,
[01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:48.880]  but not Mike Adams of naturalnews.com. So he's here to talk about this and what his YouTube
[01:48:48.880 --> 01:48:52.720]  source has told him because there are some patriots on YouTube and we've talked to him as well.
[01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:57.600]  Now Buzzfeed says it's not true. YouTube doesn't talk to us and I guess the president doesn't
[01:48:57.600 --> 01:49:03.040]  talk to us either because you just said so because you're Buzzfeed. But the point is he got this and
[01:49:03.040 --> 01:49:07.600]  they go, well, tell us your source. Oh, so they can be fired? Everybody knows our sources because
[01:49:07.600 --> 01:49:13.360]  our news turns out to be accurate 99% of the time instead of 99% of the time not being true from seeing
[01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:20.080]  it. So people know our sources. We don't give them to you. So Mike Adams, because we're protecting
[01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:25.440]  him. It's what you do in journalism. Mike Adams of naturalnews.com. Tell us what happened. This
[01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:29.840]  is incredible. I mean, I had looked at your site in a few days when this happened. I think
[01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:33.280]  didn't have hundreds of millions of years. Had you been on YouTube for like seven, eight years,
[01:49:33.280 --> 01:49:38.000]  give us the history of this huge compendium of research and knowledge that was top-linked all
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:41.680]  over the web. I mean, you run one of the biggest health sites in the world. I think only behind
[01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:46.480]  maybe Merkola. I mean, you're in the top three and they're just dynamiting you and you're really
[01:49:46.480 --> 01:49:52.160]  a nonpartisan guy. I mean, you didn't like George Bush. More than 10,000, well, I'm sorry,
[01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:59.680]  more than 1,700 videos, 10 years of videos over, I think, 350,000 subscribers. And yeah, we covered
[01:49:59.680 --> 01:50:03.920]  how to prevent cancer, how to grow your own food, how to raise backyard chickens,
[01:50:03.920 --> 01:50:10.400]  and plus I'm a pro-liberty voice. And what I am being told now is from a person who
[01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:16.160]  I can't verify who they are, but they claim to be a YouTube insider who said that
[01:50:16.160 --> 01:50:21.840]  my channel was taken down because I said there were two genders. It just, it was outrageous.
[01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:26.240]  I thought at first I was banned because I was pro-liberty. I wasn't sure. They tell you,
[01:50:26.240 --> 01:50:30.880]  you violate community guidelines, but they don't tell you which video violated or which
[01:50:30.880 --> 01:50:35.600]  phrase violated. You know, they claim if you disagree with the leftist, you're a bully.
[01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:40.880]  So if you say there are two genders now, you're a bully just for not believing there are an
[01:50:40.880 --> 01:50:47.600]  infinite number of genders and flying dragonkin human rainbow unicorns. It's insane, Alex.
[01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:50.880]  It's a war against logic. And let me be clear, because you were clear then
[01:50:51.600 --> 01:50:54.080]  before about the source, and I guess you don't want to get into my trouble, but
[01:50:54.080 --> 01:50:59.440]  we have YouTube sources. We have Facebook and Twitter. We've recorded them because some of
[01:50:59.440 --> 01:51:03.600]  them said they don't mind if we tell, because these aren't sources that like us, some of them.
[01:51:03.600 --> 01:51:09.600]  We have several recordings of a high level person at Twitter and Facebook where they call us and
[01:51:09.600 --> 01:51:14.480]  they said, if you say the T word again, you will lose your Twitter. And we haven't recorded them.
[01:51:14.480 --> 01:51:22.160]  We go, excuse us. The word training was created by transsexuals. And now in 2017, Twitter said
[01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:27.360]  it decided the executive. It was offensive. So now that words ban, you must use the word
[01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:32.400]  transsexual. I mean, they're not the FCC. Plus, I'm not even attacking anybody. They're saying
[01:51:32.400 --> 01:51:39.520]  what words I can use. So we have them recorded telling us that if you say the word, you will be
[01:51:39.520 --> 01:51:43.840]  banned. And you have the professors and people getting fired or being censured if they say
[01:51:43.840 --> 01:51:47.760]  there are two genders. So this is setting the precedent with all the transhumanism coming
[01:51:47.760 --> 01:51:52.320]  out, the chipping, all this, that if you even talk bad about any of it, you will be silenced.
[01:51:52.320 --> 01:51:55.840]  This is the new global system. I always heard in church when I was a little kid and didn't
[01:51:55.840 --> 01:51:59.360]  believe it that there'll be a one world government, one world religion. If you don't accept whatever
[01:51:59.360 --> 01:52:03.760]  that religion is, you'll be banned from commerce. Well, here we are with the Internet ID and this
[01:52:03.760 --> 01:52:10.160]  whole future Mike Adams and the Chinese model of this global social score, like something out of
[01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:16.720]  a Black Mirror episode. And you're sitting there and they're doing it. And then once they get you
[01:52:16.720 --> 01:52:21.920]  where you can't say certain things, well, then they can ban everything. They have total control,
[01:52:21.920 --> 01:52:27.440]  Mike. Well, absolutely. And by the way, my channel was called The Health Ranger for people who
[01:52:27.440 --> 01:52:33.520]  want to try to find it now. I mean, it's still gone, but maybe we can pummel YouTube on this.
[01:52:33.520 --> 01:52:39.520]  But look, they're saying that you can't quote biological reality. You can't say that men produce
[01:52:39.520 --> 01:52:46.080]  sperm. You can't say that women have ovaries. I mean, just now citing biological science has
[01:52:46.080 --> 01:52:51.280]  become a thought crime in America. If you say there are two genders, if you quote chromosomes,
[01:52:51.280 --> 01:52:56.720]  if you cite the science textbooks that are in schools but are probably being rewritten now,
[01:52:56.720 --> 01:53:03.680]  you are banned. You are basically criminalized for believing in reality. And Alex, this comes from
[01:53:03.680 --> 01:53:10.320]  a position. YouTube is actually weak. They're bullying us because their positions are weak.
[01:53:10.320 --> 01:53:15.680]  They can't survive a debate. They can't survive any kind of actual conversation about reality.
[01:53:15.680 --> 01:53:21.680]  They can't win in the idea of reason. So they have to censor their opponents. That's what this is.
[01:53:21.680 --> 01:53:25.920]  It's a, they're admitting that they have lost, they're admitting that they're weak,
[01:53:25.920 --> 01:53:30.160]  and they have to destroy their opponents rather than engaging them in intelligent conversation.
[01:53:31.440 --> 01:53:37.200]  The Church of Scotland came out last Friday. There's a story on infowars.com with the headline,
[01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:45.600]  Church of Scotland says some women have small penises. Some men have vaginas. And folks,
[01:53:45.600 --> 01:53:51.040]  this is being taught to children by the church in official literature. For the Sunday school,
[01:53:51.040 --> 01:53:54.880]  you name it, being put out as doctrine. So I know this sounds very profane on air,
[01:53:54.880 --> 01:54:00.080]  but this is documentary. We are documenting it. Some women have little penises. That's
[01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:04.160]  exact quote, says Scottish Church. That's the National Church, Church of Scotland.
[01:54:04.160 --> 01:54:09.200]  Church member feels, again, that some men have vaginas and some women have small penises,
[01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:14.800]  claims the Church of Scotland in a 30 page booklet. So this is total mental illness,
[01:54:14.800 --> 01:54:19.200]  just like the nurse got in trouble earlier this year at the National Health Service,
[01:54:19.200 --> 01:54:24.000]  because a man with a beard with large muscles and tattoos came in and said,
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:29.520]  I want a pap smear of my cervix. And she she went ahead with it and pulled his pants off and said,
[01:54:29.520 --> 01:54:35.120]  sir, you have male genitals. And last time I heard she may be fired for not going, oh, yes,
[01:54:35.120 --> 01:54:42.960]  yes, sir, yes, ma'am, let me check your your cervix here. Let me do a pap smear for any type of
[01:54:42.960 --> 01:54:50.080]  diseases on a man. I mean, what? Where is this going, Mike? Well, this is all about you have to
[01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:56.800]  play pretend now in the ever expanding insanity of the left. And you can never keep up. That's the
[01:54:56.800 --> 01:55:01.680]  thing. Even if you agree to go along with their political correctness today and speak their weird
[01:55:01.680 --> 01:55:06.080]  distorted language and use all their weird distorted pronouns, they change next week.
[01:55:06.080 --> 01:55:09.920]  And now if you don't keep up with the change, all of a sudden, you're a bigot,
[01:55:09.920 --> 01:55:14.080]  even though you were okay last week, but now you're a bigot because you didn't say she or
[01:55:14.080 --> 01:55:19.440]  Joe or she in the correct way. It is absolutely insane. Alex, they're not just destroying the
[01:55:19.440 --> 01:55:24.960]  culture. They're destroying language. They're destroying logic and reason. And the universities
[01:55:24.960 --> 01:55:30.880]  today are not teaching kids how to think they're teaching them how to conform and be obedient
[01:55:30.880 --> 01:55:36.560]  and be terrorists. Frankly, they are universities have become terrorist recruiting hubs for leftist
[01:55:36.560 --> 01:55:40.320]  and by the way, you're not just saying that when when Google makes you get an ample theater with
[01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:45.200]  their executives and executive goes, I'm a beautiful female dragon. I am a beautiful ornate
[01:55:45.200 --> 01:55:50.000]  building. And they go, you are a beautiful dragon at you are an ornate building. That is Jim Jones
[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:54.960]  cuckoo level on purpose. This is classic cult programming. It is. That's why I've called it a
[01:55:54.960 --> 01:55:59.760]  left cult. This is this is dangerous. They demand obedience. They're censoring free speech. They
[01:55:59.760 --> 01:56:03.680]  want to take away your first amendment, your second amendment, your fourth amendment. Hey,
[01:56:03.680 --> 01:56:08.800]  people, if there was ever a time to stand up and resist this insanity and defend your nation,
[01:56:08.800 --> 01:56:14.640]  it is right now. The war is on. Alex, everything that's happening. This censorship is being done
[01:56:15.200 --> 01:56:22.400]  as a prelude to something much bigger. Maybe an all out attempted communist takeover like a Stalinist.
[01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:26.560]  They are definitely hyping their people up for militaristic action. They are all you're going
[01:56:26.560 --> 01:56:31.280]  to prison. You're going to die when I see them in public. I mean, they, they are, they are spoiling.
[01:56:31.280 --> 01:56:35.440]  They are because again, once they accept to do whatever the media says to be politically correct,
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:39.760]  they can the next day say, we'll just start killing people and they will because they believe they
[01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:44.320]  have the moral right to do it. This is scientifically crafted. They will. Absolutely. This has been done
[01:56:44.320 --> 01:56:48.800]  before in history and they know that if there's enough anger pushed out there by the late night,
[01:56:48.800 --> 01:56:54.720]  so called comedy or left wing news, if there's enough anger, it bypasses rationality, bypasses
[01:56:54.720 --> 01:57:02.720]  logic. And it turns young leftists into literally a lunatic liberal mob of want to be killers.
[01:57:02.720 --> 01:57:06.320]  And that's why they're attacking people. But you know what? We're going to fight back because we
[01:57:06.320 --> 01:57:10.240]  have the right to self-defense and we have the right to defend. Are you ready to announce the
[01:57:10.240 --> 01:57:14.480]  new video site? A bunch of these are launching. Some are getting millions of subscribers day
[01:57:14.480 --> 01:57:18.720]  one. I know yours will. You're going to carry our content. Can you tell us yet the new name of the
[01:57:18.720 --> 01:57:25.120]  site? The teaser. It's up there now. Real.video. You can ask for an invitation. It's coming.
[01:57:25.120 --> 01:57:33.520]  Real.video is the site. You have done well, Lord Vader. Oh, I love it. Do what must be done, Lord
[01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:39.280]  Adams. We're going to go to break. Come right back. We got Owen Schroyer on the ground at the
[01:57:39.280 --> 01:57:44.320]  second bombing. That's an elastic third bombing in Austin for South West is Antifa behind it.
[01:57:44.320 --> 01:57:50.880]  I smell a little Antifa boobies. The reason InfoWars Life has five star ratings on major
[01:57:50.880 --> 01:57:54.800]  third party sites is because I want products I'm going to use for my family. I take this.
[01:57:54.800 --> 01:57:58.800]  My family takes this and then it funds the operation. But the most hardcore, truthful
[01:57:58.800 --> 01:58:03.040]  information you're going to find anywhere. So what you find in our news is the same thing you find

[01:58:08.960 --> 01:58:14.400]  difference. I don't feel good. The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life changing for me.
[01:58:14.400 --> 01:58:19.360]  Yeah, I've actually have just run out of my super female. I had a few bottles at my house
[01:58:19.360 --> 01:58:24.960]  and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again. Very exciting, feeling great, looking
[01:58:24.960 --> 01:58:31.600]  good. So and I know my hair is luxurious once again. So obviously the super female is amazing.
[01:58:31.600 --> 01:58:37.280]  I love it. Nascent iodine is essential. Survival Shield X2. If there's one product that I would
[01:58:37.280 --> 01:58:42.400]  say is life changing that I would suggest it's nascent iodine survival shield X2. It's got a
[01:58:42.400 --> 01:58:46.080]  five star rating. It's a win win infowarslife.com.

[02:00:10.640 --> 02:00:17.920]  Jones show because there is a war on your mind. We are back live. Ladies and gentlemen,
[02:00:17.920 --> 02:00:23.680]  if you're watching us on television, Owen shroyer is behind the yellow tape of a
[02:00:23.680 --> 02:00:31.680]  Montopolis drive in southeast Austin with a live feed of the third bombing. The third bombing since
[02:00:31.680 --> 02:00:37.760]  March 2nd, the second bombing today. There was a bombing on March 2nd. There were two
[02:00:37.760 --> 02:00:44.640]  bombings today, including fatalities breaking on infowars.com. Third explosion in Austin,
[02:00:45.600 --> 02:00:53.440]  Texas from suspicious package. Well, it's a bomb. Yes. Live video is on infowars.com.
[02:00:54.320 --> 02:00:58.960]  Live video feed on the scene of the third bombing. We're dispatching reporters to the
[02:00:58.960 --> 02:01:04.640]  bombing that happened this morning. This just happened a few hours ago. We have live coverage
[02:01:04.640 --> 02:01:11.600]  at infowars.com live video coverage on the ground at the bombing. There's not other media there.
[02:01:12.560 --> 02:01:16.160]  The police are being very, very rude to Owen telling him to even get back from the yellow
[02:01:16.160 --> 02:01:20.720]  tape. The FBI was not like that. They are searching the houses house to house.
[02:01:22.080 --> 02:01:27.360]  They've cordoned the neighborhood back two blocks. This is unprecedented. So a lot of
[02:01:27.360 --> 02:01:31.520]  breaking news there. We'll cover it some in the next segment with live feed and then go to Tommy
[02:01:31.520 --> 02:01:38.560]  Robinson who's just flown back into the UK. He's been going to Islamic no go zones. The
[02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:42.080]  police obviously coordinated Antifa to attack him and his female reporter
[02:01:43.440 --> 02:01:49.440]  who then defeated the 10 thugs who ran in fear. You cannot make up the magnitude of this. Mike
[02:01:49.440 --> 02:01:54.240]  Adams of naturalnews.com. You're normally in Austin night. Your operations are based here,
[02:01:54.240 --> 02:02:00.560]  but you are off now setting up a major new video streaming service. What do you make of this?
[02:02:00.560 --> 02:02:10.960]  Let me just make this statement. Is Antifa behind the third bombing? Here's the question. Is Antifa
[02:02:11.680 --> 02:02:17.120]  behind the now third bombing in Austin, Texas? They're violent. They call for violence.
[02:02:17.120 --> 02:02:23.280]  They call for attacking gentrification. Any old white people moving in to East Austin
[02:02:23.280 --> 02:02:27.680]  and you have three bombings that have happened. They also say old Hispanics are old blacks. If
[02:02:27.680 --> 02:02:31.760]  you're not from the neighborhood, you're not wanted. I'm just saying I think that they should be
[02:02:31.760 --> 02:02:35.360]  investigated because they are a terror group. They're listed as a terror group. They call for
[02:02:35.360 --> 02:02:40.080]  violence. They've attacked the blue cat cafe, a cat sanctuary. I believe they're prime suspects
[02:02:40.080 --> 02:02:44.560]  and that is not a conspiracy theory to say a known violent group has been calling for violence
[02:02:44.560 --> 02:02:48.720]  against gentrification and you have three bombings. I think they're prime suspects. I'm not saying
[02:02:48.720 --> 02:02:53.280]  they did it, but I think that's a normal extrapolation. What do you think, Mike Adams?
[02:02:53.280 --> 02:02:58.000]  Until we know more details, yeah, that's a reasonable speculation. Obviously,
[02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:03.200]  that can change when more facts are known. But look, remember when CNN doxxed that elderly woman who
[02:03:03.200 --> 02:03:10.240]  had posted something about pro-Trump? She is the kind of person, I believe, who would be typically
[02:03:10.240 --> 02:03:17.360]  targeted by Antifa-style domestic terrorists because CNN demonizes those people. CNN goes out
[02:03:17.360 --> 02:03:23.440]  and essentially stalks people, turns them into targets for a group, Antifa, which has said it
[02:03:23.440 --> 02:03:29.760]  wants to use violence. They're very overt about it. They're not covert. They want to kill conservatives.
[02:03:29.760 --> 02:03:34.800]  Now, whether this bombing is that or maybe just some personal vendetta against a couple of individuals
[02:03:34.800 --> 02:03:41.200]  is yet to be known, but it fits the pattern, Alex, of what Antifa promises to do to conservatives
[02:03:41.200 --> 02:03:46.960]  and political targets across America. Well, I know you're busy, but if you'll write an article
[02:03:46.960 --> 02:03:50.320]  about your site being taken down and the fact that other sites are shut down, I'd like to point out
[02:03:50.320 --> 02:03:54.320]  this has happened to thousands of prominent sites that did not come back. And the only person that
[02:03:54.320 --> 02:03:59.040]  seems to care is Matt Drudge and InfoWars, because we understand if you hang, we'll hang separately,
[02:03:59.040 --> 02:04:03.280]  my friends. We need to hang together. So again, please, I'm here a busy guy, but if you write an
[02:04:03.280 --> 02:04:08.000]  article, financialnews.com, we will post it at InfoWars, NewsWars, and I will try to send it
[02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:11.840]  out to everybody I can. We're trying to have other people that have still been banned on because,
[02:04:11.840 --> 02:04:17.840]  you know, we understand it's you today, it's us tomorrow. And finally, Breitbart and Daily Caller
[02:04:17.840 --> 02:04:21.760]  realize that and have finally come to our aid as well, because, you know, if they get banned,
[02:04:21.760 --> 02:04:26.480]  I'll stand up for them as well. So, Mike, thank you so much. Thank you, Alex. Great to join you
[02:04:26.480 --> 02:04:31.280]  today. Just a reminder, all patriots, do not build your content on centrally controlled
[02:04:31.280 --> 02:04:35.360]  tech systems anymore. Always look for alternatives. And that's the great Matt Drudge, again, that
[02:04:35.360 --> 02:04:39.600]  came here two years ago to say, decentralize, get out of the electronic ghettos, the censorship
[02:04:39.600 --> 02:04:43.680]  is coming, the Supreme Court justice told him, and it's all here now. Even though Trump got elected,
[02:04:43.680 --> 02:04:47.040]  they're still trying to deploy it. We need to bust up these trusts, we need to get aggressive,
[02:04:47.040 --> 02:04:51.440]  and we are filing lawsuits very, very soon. Thank you, Mike Adams. We'll be back as the fight
[02:04:51.440 --> 02:04:54.160]  for the restoration of humanity's destiny continues.
[02:04:57.120 --> 02:05:03.680]  I'm so excited. The new product at InfoWarsLife.com in a glass bottle, two-month servings filled to
[02:05:03.680 --> 02:05:11.360]  the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill. This is a heart and brain pill, a new
[02:05:11.360 --> 02:05:16.320]  tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy, does it stimulate because it's beyond
[02:05:16.320 --> 02:05:22.880]  that. Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients,
[02:05:22.880 --> 02:05:28.480]  but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae,
[02:05:28.480 --> 02:05:34.720]  and I came up with our own formulae, working with scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right
[02:05:34.720 --> 02:05:41.280]  here in America, 120 capsules. And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglonone to it, which is
[02:05:41.280 --> 02:05:46.240]  the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your
[02:05:46.240 --> 02:05:54.400]  glands. It is amazing. Red pill now available at InfoWarsStore.com and your purchase fugs the
[02:05:54.400 --> 02:06:10.320]  operation. Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:24.480 --> 02:06:39.120]  You'll take my life, but I'll take yours too. You'll find a musket, but I'll run you through.
[02:06:40.160 --> 02:06:45.360]  So when you're waiting for the next attack, you better stand, there's no turning back.
[02:06:46.160 --> 02:06:50.960]  A few more serves, the turn begins. Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live in the third hour
[02:06:50.960 --> 02:06:57.680]  broadcasting worldwide. I am your host, Alex Jones. Our intrepid reporters, Jake Lloyd,
[02:06:57.680 --> 02:07:02.160]  has now joined him, and of course, Owen Schreuer, are at the site of a third bombing
[02:07:02.160 --> 02:07:08.320]  in Southeast Austin, very close. I mean, I'm talking a mile away from our warehouse,
[02:07:08.320 --> 02:07:14.480]  not our broadcast facility in Central Austin, but from our warehouse. I mean, this is right down the
[02:07:14.480 --> 02:07:20.000]  road and you've got multiple people reportedly dead, others injured. This is the third bombing,
[02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:24.560]  since March 2nd, one bombing March 2nd, two bombings today during South by Southwest.
[02:07:24.560 --> 02:07:29.120]  Antifa has been breaking in the houses of old people. Communists have been beating people up.
[02:07:29.120 --> 02:07:35.440]  They have been attacking cat sanctuaries, beating out the windows, poisoning the cats. Some of the
[02:07:35.440 --> 02:07:42.080]  cats died with reportedly whatever they threw in, putting superglue on the locks, telling the two
[02:07:42.080 --> 02:07:47.440]  white liberals they're not welcome. This is communist whites leading minorities in bizarre
[02:07:47.440 --> 02:07:52.080]  activity. The Huffington Post has endorsed violence against gentrification. If you're an old black
[02:07:52.080 --> 02:07:57.600]  woman or an old white woman or anybody who's not from East Austin, quote, right to return,
[02:07:58.560 --> 02:08:05.920]  the city's passing a law, you are not welcome. And the Huffington Post and others have endorsed
[02:08:05.920 --> 02:08:10.640]  violence. When we said it was wrong to attack the cat cafe and wrong that old people got their
[02:08:10.640 --> 02:08:14.800]  houses vandalized this year and last year, they said we were wrong. And the Huffington Post says
[02:08:14.800 --> 02:08:21.200]  violence is good. So we're asking the question right now, is this part of Antifa violence?
[02:08:21.840 --> 02:08:27.040]  And again, we're going to do a live feed in the fourth hour. I'll go ahead and host the fourth
[02:08:27.040 --> 02:08:33.600]  hour. We're going to do a live feed with Owen Shroyer and others on the ground with Jake Lloyd.
[02:08:33.600 --> 02:08:40.000]  So no, Jake's deployed. I want more live feeds on info wars.com. We have the headline live video
[02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:50.480]  feed from the Austin bombings live live video feed at the site of the Austin bombing. Okay,
[02:08:50.480 --> 02:08:56.160]  that's the name. That's the article we've got on info wars.com. And we need to get that link out
[02:08:56.160 --> 02:09:00.160]  because locals are saying they blocked off the roads. They've backed people way off
[02:09:01.200 --> 02:09:04.400]  to blocks and they're searching everybody's houses in the area.
[02:09:04.400 --> 02:09:12.960]  As if neighbors are involved. What do the police and FBI know? And it seems like every time
[02:09:13.520 --> 02:09:16.640]  there's an event like the Boston bombing, they shut the whole city down.
[02:09:17.360 --> 02:09:22.080]  And then the guys caught by a neighbor, not by the city being caught down. So
[02:09:23.440 --> 02:09:27.520]  I don't understand why they're doing that. But maybe they've got some information we don't have.
[02:09:27.520 --> 02:09:34.720]  But live feeds are on info wars.com and news wars.com right now. If you want to see those
[02:09:34.720 --> 02:09:41.040]  feeds, I don't even see mainstream media there. So we're at the side of the latest bombing where
[02:09:41.040 --> 02:09:45.920]  there was at least one fatality. Another bombing this morning. So there have been multiple deaths
[02:09:45.920 --> 02:09:56.480]  total from this. And again, Owen is right there about 100 feet from the house. And from our
[02:09:56.480 --> 02:10:05.200]  intel talking to locals that Nico Acosta is monitoring, they seem to have blocks in blocks
[02:10:05.200 --> 02:10:09.040]  one direction, but then he's able to get up close to the house from another direction. So they
[02:10:10.080 --> 02:10:14.640]  seem to be searching only in two directions, not in four directions. We're going to try to
[02:10:14.640 --> 02:10:19.200]  figure that out. Doesn't seem to be a random search. They may have gotten some tips in a certain
[02:10:19.200 --> 02:10:25.280]  direction and other issues going on. But right now, I would say prime suspects are anti-fee,
[02:10:25.280 --> 02:10:29.520]  are anti-genrification groups because these are the known violent groups that kind of fashion
[02:10:29.520 --> 02:10:34.160]  themselves after the unabomber kind of the prototype of this whole thing. I'm not saying
[02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:38.400]  that is what happened. I'm not saying the bombings didn't happen. I'm not saying they're crisis
[02:10:38.400 --> 02:10:42.880]  actors, the media will lie and say that out of hand. Now if I thought that, I would tell you that.
[02:10:44.240 --> 02:10:50.640]  So it is simply amazing info wars.com news wars.com. Now we're going to break.
[02:10:50.640 --> 02:10:56.640]  We come back from break. Tommy Robinson, amazing individual is joining us. We've been in negotiations
[02:10:56.640 --> 02:11:01.600]  for six months to get him to join the team. I'm so excited. I want to work with him today when
[02:11:01.600 --> 02:11:06.560]  I get off here. He just got back from Austria to try to set it up because he needs a studio,
[02:11:06.560 --> 02:11:12.000]  he needs security. He's just doing an amazing job. But as you know, we've been under attack
[02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:16.480]  by the globalists and we're just trying to decide what our budget is. But I'm just going to expand
[02:11:16.480 --> 02:11:21.600]  and try to work something out because this guy is doing an incredible job. So is his camera lady.
[02:11:21.600 --> 02:11:27.600]  She got attacked by Antifa, fought them off. He knocked down at least four or five of them.
[02:11:27.600 --> 02:11:34.960]  It's incredible footage. It's on info wars.com. It's on prisonplanet.com. It's all there. So
[02:11:36.800 --> 02:11:42.400]  this is going to be a riveting 45 minutes because it shows you everything. 10 thugs attack a man
[02:11:42.400 --> 02:11:48.160]  and a woman. They kick their butts and they run in fear. And then the Daily Mail calls it, oh,
[02:11:48.160 --> 02:11:56.320]  the young scrapper has been in a fight with people. No, ladies and gentlemen, that's not
[02:11:56.320 --> 02:12:04.160]  what happened. So Tommy Robinson is here and we've got Tommy Robinson.com, Twitter at T
[02:12:04.160 --> 02:12:09.040]  Robinson, new era. I get so wound up. I started saying his name wrong, even though I love the guy.
[02:12:09.040 --> 02:12:14.480]  I mean, it's just things are so crazy at this point. And the attacks here are so insane.
[02:12:15.200 --> 02:12:18.560]  And then the attacks against him are so insane. It is just such a time now
[02:12:20.480 --> 02:12:24.880]  to be involved. So Tommy Robinson is going to be joining us from the UK after we go to break.
[02:12:24.880 --> 02:12:30.640]  Now, by the way, I have barely plugged today or any other days. And I was talking to him for
[02:12:30.640 --> 02:12:36.400]  Jay last night and this morning who heads up our general operations. And he said, listen,
[02:12:36.400 --> 02:12:43.120]  Alex, we did the numbers. We're making 5% on the sale. You've cut the prices
[02:12:44.080 --> 02:12:48.960]  on many of these things below what they cost us. And yes, we're bringing in record amounts of
[02:12:48.960 --> 02:12:56.000]  general money, but none of it do we keep. So will you please start worrying about money and meeting
[02:12:56.000 --> 02:13:04.320]  with us? Because you might sell $10 million worth of supplements, but if you only make $100,
[02:13:04.320 --> 02:13:09.680]  $200,000, it doesn't do anything. I just love to get people really good prices. And then I just
[02:13:09.680 --> 02:13:13.360]  start throwing out numbers here because I don't really plan a lot of that stuff. And so here's
[02:13:13.360 --> 02:13:19.040]  the deal. These are the biggest special we've ever run 30 to 80% off the general special 50% off.
[02:13:19.920 --> 02:13:23.760]  We don't mark stuff up seven times like other supplement makers. That's the average.
[02:13:23.760 --> 02:13:27.440]  We mark it up 100%. Well, when you do 50%, what's that do?
[02:13:27.440 --> 02:13:34.560]  So infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, Supermelt Vitality 50% off for female,
[02:13:34.560 --> 02:13:36.880]  Biome Defense amazing probiotic 50% off.
[02:13:38.960 --> 02:13:45.360]  It's defeat CNN's attempts to crush info wars. And we've got the prebiotic fiber that is an
[02:13:45.360 --> 02:13:51.600]  amazing product. It's best sourced prebiotic fiber for the very best fruits. And it really flushes
[02:13:51.600 --> 02:13:56.720]  out everything. It's amazing. It's a 30 day supply concentrated. It's 50% off. You can
[02:13:56.720 --> 02:14:01.360]  already see it's got five star reviews, even though that's our newest product. You notice
[02:14:01.360 --> 02:14:04.880]  we have the strongest turmeric formula from our research out there, body's ultimate turmeric
[02:14:04.880 --> 02:14:10.560]  formula. And I told you, Hey, we're selling 50% off. And it's got a, you know, highest score,
[02:14:10.560 --> 02:14:16.480]  95% curcuminant level. It sold out in three weeks. Notice it never came back in. So it's still not
[02:14:16.480 --> 02:14:20.160]  in. I mean, I don't just say, Oh, this is a great deal. Oh, this is the strongest out there. Oh,
[02:14:20.160 --> 02:14:24.640]  it's going to sell out. And then it does sell out. I wish and Tim's like n one steps about to sell
[02:14:24.640 --> 02:14:28.880]  out. You got to stop and budget it at the full price till the more it comes in, then we'll have
[02:14:28.880 --> 02:14:33.120]  plenty of money. So I think I'm just going to turn stuff over to Tim for Shay and the marketers
[02:14:33.120 --> 02:14:37.200]  because they're always trying to get me to come up with new stuff, everything. And I just kind of
[02:14:37.200 --> 02:14:42.480]  back of an envelope to it. And so thank you all for your support. You bought a mega ton of stuff.
[02:14:42.480 --> 02:14:46.080]  We've never been selling this much stuff. We're selling almost double what we were selling a
[02:14:46.080 --> 02:14:52.160]  year ago, but I am selling it to cheap. I'm just making it too good of a deal because that's how
[02:14:52.160 --> 02:14:57.280]  I am infowarstore.com infowarslife.com or triple A two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[02:14:57.920 --> 02:15:03.840]  And you're going to see us go ahead and hire five or six new awesome reporters to be on the ground
[02:15:03.840 --> 02:15:08.560]  and on the air like Tommy Robinson. But he's been again, wanting to join the crew for months. And I
[02:15:08.560 --> 02:15:11.520]  just been give me another month, give me another month, give me another month. I got a budget,
[02:15:11.520 --> 02:15:14.960]  the money I got to see what I got. And the left's following all these lawsuits and all this. But
[02:15:14.960 --> 02:15:19.280]  you know what, I'm just going to move forward on faith. I'm going to blast forward blast our way
[02:15:19.280 --> 02:15:22.960]  to victory because I'm not going to just stay the same size. They're trying to crush us. I must
[02:15:22.960 --> 02:15:27.920]  expand in the face of the attacks like doomsday or we'll be destroyed. I mean, we've got to get
[02:15:27.920 --> 02:15:33.360]  bigger under attack. We can't stay the same and hold the line. We must advance. We must win.
[02:15:33.360 --> 02:15:38.480]  Holding the line is losing. We're crushing them right now in general, but they're targeting us
[02:15:38.480 --> 02:15:43.040]  for extermination because we're a lead attack ship. I need your financial support. You need these

[02:20:38.960 --> 02:20:46.160]  All right, joining us into the next hour is not just the man of the hour, the last few years,
[02:20:46.160 --> 02:20:50.960]  Tommy Robinson has just been on fire. He's been exposing the recruiting of little girls
[02:20:50.960 --> 02:20:55.200]  for sex slavery that's now mainstream news in the UK, thousands per town, one small town at
[02:20:55.200 --> 02:21:00.160]  4,000 groomed, some of them murdered, disappeared, flown overseas. He's been imprisoned, put in
[02:21:00.160 --> 02:21:05.920]  general population with Muslims, they've tried to kill him. He goes out with his family to picnics
[02:21:05.920 --> 02:21:10.000]  and Islamists attack him. He kicks their butt and the police throw him out of the town.
[02:21:11.200 --> 02:21:15.920]  Now he went to Italy where famous Italian journalist females go and get beat up at the
[02:21:15.920 --> 02:21:20.800]  no-go zones. I've been in Rome and the police say, oh, it's incredible. If you even go to the
[02:21:20.800 --> 02:21:25.440]  parks or under the trees, there's just thousands of North Africans just sitting around. They attack
[02:21:25.440 --> 02:21:29.840]  you. But the media says there's no, no such thing as no-go zones. So he goes there,
[02:21:30.560 --> 02:21:33.120]  some North Africans try to attack him. He knocks one of them out. They said,
[02:21:33.120 --> 02:21:38.240]  we're going to kill your family. They're trying to punch him and he smacks them. Then they are,
[02:21:38.240 --> 02:21:44.240]  well, he'll tell you the whole story behind the viral videos of 10 Antifa thugs attacking him
[02:21:44.800 --> 02:21:50.720]  and his female reporter. They fight back and Antifa runs. He knocks down at least four of them.
[02:21:52.720 --> 02:21:58.320]  I mean, these soy boy methods cannot take a punch, but it's incredible and how they show up all
[02:21:58.320 --> 02:22:03.040]  of a sudden with the police watching. I believe the police were coordinating this because in these,
[02:22:03.040 --> 02:22:08.000]  he's under Sadiq Khan there. So Mr. Robbins joins us. Here are some excerpts of the video.
[02:22:09.200 --> 02:22:14.320]  And you can follow him at Tee Robbins new era on Twitter. He has his new video site. He's left
[02:22:14.320 --> 02:22:18.640]  rebel media. And I got to say it's been explosive since he left. He was rebel. Didn't want to get
[02:22:18.640 --> 02:22:22.880]  killed, which I understand. He's now out on the streets. Everywhere he goes, he gets pat on the
[02:22:22.880 --> 02:22:27.840]  back by Christian Africans and by Sikhs and Indians love him because they know they've been under
[02:22:27.840 --> 02:22:35.600]  Islamic attack. But the Antifa communists with Sadiq Khan and his police are out to shut him down.
[02:22:35.600 --> 02:22:40.160]  We've had reporters trying to get into the UK, Laura Southern from Canada.
[02:22:40.160 --> 02:22:44.080]  They got arrested. Others got arrested. That's on info wars.com. But let's go
[02:22:44.080 --> 02:23:00.000]  to excerpts of what happened in Italy and what just happened in London. Here it is.
[02:23:14.080 --> 02:23:31.200]  But what's amazing is Tommy doesn't say mean things to these people.
[02:23:31.760 --> 02:23:35.760]  They come up and try to attack him in Rome. You name it. We're going to find out what happened
[02:23:35.760 --> 02:23:39.200]  behind us. And we haven't even shown you the beginning of the footage. We'll roll that in a
[02:23:39.200 --> 02:23:42.800]  few minutes after we've talked to Tommy and given them open statements. But I'm just setting this
[02:23:42.800 --> 02:23:49.920]  up here. He's in a McDonald's parking lot and 10 men come up. He's backing away. They start
[02:23:49.920 --> 02:23:54.320]  attacking him. He defends himself to try to hit him. He goes at him first smart when, you know,
[02:23:54.320 --> 02:24:00.080]  10 guys are coming around you. If you can't get away, the media spun it like Tommy Robinson got
[02:24:00.080 --> 02:24:05.520]  in a fight. No, they masked men attacked two reporters and the two reporters fought back
[02:24:05.520 --> 02:24:10.320]  and the Cowards ran. That's the real headline. What is the real headline here, Tommy Robinson?
[02:24:10.320 --> 02:24:17.680]  Incredible. You are on fire. You are on fire, my friend. Thanks, Alex. The real headline is,
[02:24:18.880 --> 02:24:22.560]  all the way through this, I knew at certain points that with Lucy and with George as well,
[02:24:22.560 --> 02:24:27.840]  who are the camera team with us, I knew we'd get attacked at certain times. But I never thought
[02:24:27.840 --> 02:24:34.240]  they'd go for Lucy. I guess I thought too highly of them. I thought they had morals. So I always
[02:24:34.240 --> 02:24:38.480]  said them and as soon as they turned up and I saw the mask, I basically getting out of the car,
[02:24:38.480 --> 02:24:43.920]  I looked across, I see seven men coming towards me with masks and then I stood and I tried to
[02:24:43.920 --> 02:24:48.800]  move away from Lucy. I thought they'd all go for me. So I thought, that's sound. I'll move away.
[02:24:48.800 --> 02:24:54.240]  They'll all come for me. They didn't. They sectioned off. One went to George and one went to Lucy.
[02:24:54.240 --> 02:24:59.040]  And then as you can see, he starts attacking Lucy. He's resting on the floor. But to be honest,
[02:24:59.040 --> 02:25:04.560]  Lucy gave as good as she got. Lucy gave as good as she got and he ended up, she was kicking him
[02:25:04.560 --> 02:25:09.040]  and hitting him. And even at the end, I looked over and even see George, the other camera lad as well,
[02:25:09.040 --> 02:25:15.360]  scuffling with them as well. But they were masked up. They were ready to attack us. And as you're
[02:25:15.360 --> 02:25:21.840]  right, straight after this, the police have turned up. They've done nothing. I found out,
[02:25:21.840 --> 02:25:26.400]  I walked around the corner to where these men were. There was a mosque because there was,
[02:25:26.400 --> 02:25:36.080]  there was a mosque, a communist alignment between the Kurds and Antifa. They were joining up for
[02:25:36.080 --> 02:25:41.120]  this day. I've actually got leaflets and show that they were practicing fighting techniques.
[02:25:41.120 --> 02:25:45.280]  By the way, I was told by the hostage rescue team in the FBI, and this started coming out later,
[02:25:45.280 --> 02:25:50.800]  we were told the day after Vegas that it was Kurdish groups with Antifa, with Saudis that
[02:25:50.800 --> 02:25:54.400]  carried out the attack. And now it's coming out the news that they have merged with them. So,
[02:25:54.400 --> 02:25:58.400]  yes, tell us, tell us why they knew where you were, why they attacked you in the McDonald's
[02:25:58.400 --> 02:26:03.520]  parking lot. Why were they ready for you? Break that down for us. The only thing I can think
[02:26:03.520 --> 02:26:08.320]  is we was in that McDonald's car park. I'd been in McDonald's, we was in the car park for 30 minutes.
[02:26:08.320 --> 02:26:14.320]  So someone must have spotted us. And the more I get people look at me funnily wherever I go,
[02:26:14.320 --> 02:26:18.400]  I think it's because they realized who I am. I remember a girl standing there with a hood up,
[02:26:18.400 --> 02:26:23.760]  and I can still see her face. So I think, I think it must have been her. And then they've made the
[02:26:23.760 --> 02:26:28.000]  call. And what I realized was there was a hundred of them around the corner. There's a hundred of
[02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:33.040]  them. When I went back around there, there's a hundred of them in a mosque, Antifa, all their
[02:26:33.040 --> 02:26:37.600]  leading members, and they're having a practice day where they're practicing their fight club,
[02:26:38.160 --> 02:26:43.840]  and they're practicing training to attack the fascists. And lo and behold, that's what happened.
[02:26:43.840 --> 02:26:47.840]  But he, they better get some more training. I mean, it looks like you knocked down at least four of
[02:26:47.840 --> 02:26:55.600]  them. Well, look at my face, Alex. If seven men, if seven men want to come, masked up, ready to do
[02:26:55.600 --> 02:27:00.560]  damage, why am I sitting here looking pretty? Well, the number of people said was 10, but I guess
[02:27:00.560 --> 02:27:05.520]  you actually fought seven, correct? They're seven. Yes, seven. And one went, one went, but they
[02:27:05.520 --> 02:27:10.160]  must have had it planned as well, because they broke off straight away. One went for the camera,
[02:27:10.160 --> 02:27:14.800]  go went for one of them for the camera man. Why can't they take a punch? I mean, I mean, I'm,
[02:27:14.800 --> 02:27:19.520]  I mean, you're smacking them pretty good, but they are just like, they think it's a video game.
[02:27:19.520 --> 02:27:24.160]  It's the same thing when, when the bodyguards of Michael Moore hit me in some video in my film,
[02:27:24.160 --> 02:27:28.000]  Marshall Law, and I hit them back. They're like, why'd you do that? I'm like, dude,
[02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:31.600]  same thing happened to Michelle Malcolm's bodyguard. He bumped into me. I punched him right
[02:27:31.600 --> 02:27:35.200]  in the stomach with my elbow, and he started crying. It's like, yeah, dude, it's a two way
[02:27:35.200 --> 02:27:39.760]  street. Sorry, go ahead. There's a few other, there's a few other minutes that were missing
[02:27:39.760 --> 02:27:43.840]  from the footage from where they grabbed the cameras. But the situation was that because
[02:27:43.840 --> 02:27:48.240]  there's so many of them, every time one of them was coming at me and I'd go to punch back or
[02:27:48.240 --> 02:27:53.680]  fight back, then one of them comes from somewhere else. And yeah, but as I said, they didn't do a
[02:27:53.680 --> 02:27:59.280]  very good job. And what currently is happening is in the UK, the far left, because of how embarrassing
[02:27:59.280 --> 02:28:04.640]  this is, these are the people who claim to protect women. They claim to be defending minorities and
[02:28:04.640 --> 02:28:10.720]  defending women. And here they are violently attacking a female journalist on her own, violently
[02:28:10.720 --> 02:28:14.640]  throwing her on the floor. And here they are. And then because of this situation, I believe
[02:28:14.640 --> 02:28:18.800]  that most of the left and even journalists are coming out saying it's a staged fight.
[02:28:19.360 --> 02:28:25.120]  It's a, and the fact, the other thing is, I'm going to find these people. So we will have
[02:28:25.120 --> 02:28:30.160]  follow up videos coming out once I do find out who they are. I'm already think I'm on the process
[02:28:30.160 --> 02:28:35.280]  of finding out a few of them. So stay right there. Stay right there. You're my hero, man.
[02:28:35.280 --> 02:28:39.920]  You already were, but this is amazing. Here's the deal. For six months, he's wanting to work
[02:28:39.920 --> 02:28:43.200]  with us and I wanting to, I've just been trying to get the capital to do it right because this
[02:28:43.200 --> 02:28:47.280]  guy needs a big platform that we're going to be right back. I want him to just have the floor
[02:28:47.280 --> 02:28:52.160]  recap where he was, why it happened, what's coming next, and what happened in that missing space.
[02:28:52.160 --> 02:28:54.640]  What happened in that missing space? We're going to talk about that.
[02:28:56.080 --> 02:29:01.680]  Hear that? That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.
[02:29:02.560 --> 02:29:08.160]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed. This year resolved not to be the next victim

[02:30:03.440 --> 02:30:09.200]  patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that
[02:30:09.200 --> 02:30:16.320]  in our local areas as well. And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks for the
[02:30:16.320 --> 02:30:21.040]  awesome BrainForce Anthroplex. My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the Anthroplex too.
[02:30:21.040 --> 02:30:25.680]  Thank you. I use the BioTrue Selenium, the Super Blue toothpaste for you folks who aren't big,
[02:30:25.680 --> 02:30:30.880]  normal toothpaste fans. The Super Blue is awesome. And thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars
[02:30:30.880 --> 02:30:36.080]  life products. They are quality. I can't wait to get some more. And thank you so much for doing
[02:30:36.080 --> 02:30:41.520]  that for us to keep us healthy. Absolutely. Because then we could all as educated patriots
[02:30:41.520 --> 02:30:46.880]  help our other countrymen and women understand that there's a bigger problems going on. And if we
[02:30:46.880 --> 02:30:51.680]  can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[02:30:56.240 --> 02:31:00.080]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in
[02:31:00.080 --> 02:31:04.800]  stock at InfoWarsStore.com. The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week. I thought it
[02:31:04.800 --> 02:31:09.040]  would be a six-month supply for listeners. And since then, people are beating down our doors,
[02:31:09.040 --> 02:31:14.000]  wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue. Research across the board is clear. In fact,
[02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:18.560]  it's certified. When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream. But if you contribute
[02:31:18.560 --> 02:31:23.040]  to blood clots and heart attacks, that's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health
[02:31:23.040 --> 02:31:27.840]  warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body. Super Blue fluoride
[02:31:27.840 --> 02:31:32.160]  free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula. It's loaded with good halogen iodide, some of
[02:31:32.160 --> 02:31:37.040]  the bad halogen fluoride. Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical
[02:31:37.040 --> 02:31:41.760]  times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath. Just some of the ingredients in

[02:31:58.240 --> 02:32:03.520]  real news. They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[02:32:03.520 --> 02:32:09.040]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative
[02:32:09.040 --> 02:32:15.120]  over and over again. And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance. All to
[02:32:15.120 --> 02:32:20.880]  make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and
[02:32:20.880 --> 02:32:27.440]  homophobia to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize
[02:32:27.440 --> 02:32:34.720]  the law-abiding until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[02:32:34.720 --> 02:32:40.960]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage. The only way we stop this,
[02:32:40.960 --> 02:32:48.480]  the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies with the clenched
[02:32:48.480 --> 02:32:55.360]  fist of truth. I'm the National Rifle Association of America and I'm Freedom's Safest Place.
[02:33:18.800 --> 02:33:28.480]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Commence Center and the heart of the resistance.
[02:33:28.480 --> 02:33:53.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am so excited because Tommy Robinson is on fire and he's got a new
[02:33:53.040 --> 02:33:56.160]  website as well that he's going to tell you about here in just a moment. But I'm going to try to
[02:33:56.160 --> 02:34:01.680]  shut up. I get so excited. He's going to tell you the missing tape while the camera people had the
[02:34:01.680 --> 02:34:06.560]  cameras knocked out of their hands, while the woman's being attacked by what I see is two people
[02:34:06.560 --> 02:34:11.120]  count as ten Antifa, but I guess seven that attacked him and then some women that were reportedly
[02:34:11.120 --> 02:34:16.400]  saw him and were part of it also reported because around the block Antifa was training at a mosque
[02:34:17.200 --> 02:34:22.800]  to do just this very thing. And so imagine this, Tommy Robinson is just driving around,
[02:34:22.800 --> 02:34:27.600]  he pulls up in a car park by McDonald's. They recognize him and by the time they come back
[02:34:27.600 --> 02:34:31.920]  out they're being attacked. He tries to draw them off. So you've got the floor,
[02:34:31.920 --> 02:34:36.400]  break down where you were, what happened, where it is in London, what the mosque is doing,
[02:34:36.400 --> 02:34:40.640]  and then we'll tie this into your trip to Europe. Reporter's not being allowed into the U.K. I mean
[02:34:40.640 --> 02:34:48.000]  this is serious. Your Islamic mayor, Sadiq Khan, please continue. Yeah, so basically what's concerning
[02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:54.400]  is that there's a Kurdish mosque and Antifa were holding a training day in the mosque.
[02:34:54.400 --> 02:34:58.880]  And they had guest speakers and one of the conditions, with all the stuff I've found,
[02:34:58.880 --> 02:35:03.600]  one of the conditions was they can't have any alcohol because they have to respect the martyrs.
[02:35:03.600 --> 02:35:09.840]  Now I was aware that the Kurdish struggle was also a communist struggle. That's what I was also aware of.
[02:35:09.840 --> 02:35:14.720]  But seeing the two aligned completely, seeing them come together using the same facilities,
[02:35:14.720 --> 02:35:18.320]  seeing them share speeches and platforms about how they're going to tackle fascism,
[02:35:18.320 --> 02:35:23.840]  which basically means anyone that's not a socialist or communist. Yeah, it's a worrying sign
[02:35:23.840 --> 02:35:29.200]  because usually Antifa usually try to wind the Muslims up. But here they are with what people
[02:35:29.200 --> 02:35:35.120]  would say is the most liberal of Muslims joining and aligning on their left wing views or their far
[02:35:35.120 --> 02:35:41.520]  left agendas. Now, we was in the car park, as I've said, I didn't think they'd attack Lucy, stupid me,
[02:35:41.520 --> 02:35:48.240]  they did. They attacked us. But even the police's response, there's another video,
[02:35:48.240 --> 02:35:53.360]  there's a 50 minute long video where after this attack, I walked to the mosque. And when I get
[02:35:53.360 --> 02:35:59.120]  to the mosque, all the police are there. And they're saying, again, they're saying, get back, go away.
[02:35:59.120 --> 02:36:04.880]  I'm saying that the gang of men that just jumped me are in there. What are you going to do about it?
[02:36:05.680 --> 02:36:09.360]  And they do nothing. They actually say, well, because you can't identify them because they had
[02:36:09.360 --> 02:36:14.000]  masks on, which if you reverse these situations, reverse the roles for one minute, you've got a
[02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:19.840]  Muslim woman and you've got a Muslim man. And then seven or eight young white men come non-Muslims,
[02:36:19.840 --> 02:36:25.440]  come and attack them, jump them and beat the girl up and physically assault them. The police would
[02:36:25.440 --> 02:36:30.880]  shut that entire venue down. They would make sure they get the video evidence of every single
[02:36:30.880 --> 02:36:36.720]  beer clothing that every single individual is wearing. They would launch a massive investigation.
[02:36:36.720 --> 02:36:41.120]  They would go and get the CCTV from every single building within the vicinity.
[02:36:41.120 --> 02:36:47.120]  They would put it on the national news. It'd be white supremacist hate crimes committed
[02:36:47.120 --> 02:36:52.400]  against a poor, innocent Muslim woman. It'd be the number one story in the world. But because
[02:36:52.400 --> 02:36:58.560]  it wasn't, they shut it down. Well, no one's even spoke about poor Lucy, really. No one spoke about
[02:36:59.280 --> 02:37:03.520]  her. I haven't seen one journalist. No one's contacted her. No media have contacted her.
[02:37:03.520 --> 02:37:09.440]  She's violently attacked for being a journalist. They're journalists. But yet every single report
[02:37:09.440 --> 02:37:16.080]  from the mainstream media, Tommy Robinson fighting with masked men. No, that's not how it was.
[02:37:16.080 --> 02:37:21.120]  Tommy Robinson was getting a burger from McDonald's and his camera girl and his camera man were
[02:37:21.120 --> 02:37:26.160]  violently attacked by a gang of thugs. Give us the headlines. We're going to name this video that.
[02:37:26.160 --> 02:37:33.520]  I mean, you're absolutely right. A gang of masked thugs, viciously attacked female reporter, media
[02:37:33.520 --> 02:37:39.360]  covers it up. I mean, that's really the headline. And police refused to act. Police refused to deal
[02:37:39.360 --> 02:37:46.000]  with it. The police actually said, I looked around and I said, there's a CCTV camera straight above
[02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:52.240]  my head. I want that footage because that will show all of it. I want all the footage. But of
[02:37:52.240 --> 02:37:56.720]  course, they said, unless you can identify them. And then when they're talking about the crime,
[02:37:56.720 --> 02:38:02.560]  they said, oh, it's a public order. It's not public order. It's a violent, politically motivated hate
[02:38:02.560 --> 02:38:08.240]  crime, which is what you keep going on about. It's a hate crime. They are purposely targeting of us
[02:38:08.240 --> 02:38:12.800]  because of our beliefs. We've been violently attacked. We've been robbed. They took, they
[02:38:12.800 --> 02:38:17.920]  smashed the camera. They stole the microphone, a 500 pound microphone. It's a street robbery as well.
[02:38:17.920 --> 02:38:23.920]  But none of these charges have been bought or looked into or investigated. It's just, that's it.
[02:38:23.920 --> 02:38:28.400]  You got beat up. They're gone. The police are actually standing with them. Well, you know,
[02:38:28.400 --> 02:38:33.120]  the answer, you need to, you need to recruit a Sikh or an Indian to go undercover and record the
[02:38:33.120 --> 02:38:39.120]  mosque and blow their entire operation. It's time for covert action. It should be. It should be.
[02:38:39.120 --> 02:38:44.080]  And to be honest, what I said is when they do this, so when these videos go viral,
[02:38:44.080 --> 02:38:51.200]  they expose themselves. They expose themselves. And we're always, what the media do is they use it
[02:38:51.200 --> 02:38:56.480]  no matter what to try and tarnish me or defame me or slander me and bracket me as a fag, as a violent
[02:38:56.480 --> 02:39:02.240]  hooligan. So that if someone's going to come up to me, the same in Rome, if someone's going to threaten
[02:39:02.240 --> 02:39:06.640]  your life, if someone's going to violently attack you, you're going to fight back. And that's all
[02:39:06.640 --> 02:39:12.160]  I've done. And usually to be honest, Alex, I have to put my hands behind my back in so many
[02:39:12.160 --> 02:39:16.560]  situations. There's been so many times when I've been punched first, when I shouldn't have been
[02:39:16.560 --> 02:39:22.080]  punched first. It's like this situation there you're watching. People would only be happy if I let
[02:39:22.080 --> 02:39:28.960]  him stab me. So I'm fed up of being a punch bag, if I'm honest. I'm fed up of continually having to
[02:39:29.520 --> 02:39:35.840]  not act with my instinct and defend myself, because I'm constantly worried of being prosecuted
[02:39:35.840 --> 02:39:40.400]  and put in prison, because I know that the system and and the government must be clear.
[02:39:40.400 --> 02:39:43.920]  They've got you on probation, even though they're overthrowing your, your, your, uh,
[02:39:43.920 --> 02:39:47.520]  conviction right now, they took your house, everything, because you fought back when
[02:39:47.520 --> 02:39:51.200]  Muslims attacked you. Uh, you now go to the houses of the people that are saying they're
[02:39:51.200 --> 02:39:54.640]  going to kill you. I mean, this is just insane. The climate there.
[02:39:56.400 --> 02:40:03.120]  The climate in the last I've watched and I am for the first time in a long time,
[02:40:03.760 --> 02:40:09.360]  I am very, very worried. I'm very worried because I watched as when Darren Osborne,
[02:40:09.360 --> 02:40:14.640]  who was a white man who drove a van into Muslims outside of Mosque, when the police opened up
[02:40:14.640 --> 02:40:18.400]  that court case, the big one, the biggest terrorist court cases in our country, especially with the
[02:40:18.400 --> 02:40:22.800]  media, of course, because he was white. When they opened up that court case, they opened up with a
[02:40:22.800 --> 02:40:28.400]  blatant lie. They said that he had direct Twitter messages with Tommy Robinson. And they also
[02:40:28.400 --> 02:40:35.360]  blamed him for wars. I should add. Yes, of course. And they didn't warn me. And when they've done that,
[02:40:35.360 --> 02:40:42.720]  the media run with it everywhere. Now, because of that, and since then, the lead officer and
[02:40:42.720 --> 02:40:49.200]  counterterrorism and man called Mark Rowley, he come out two weeks ago and he gave a speech where
[02:40:49.200 --> 02:40:54.720]  he said, Tommy Robinson is just basically the same as Angem Chowdhury. Angem Chowdhury is the
[02:40:54.720 --> 02:41:00.080]  leader of a prescribed terrorist organization. 60% of Muslims in British prisons for terrorism
[02:41:00.080 --> 02:41:04.960]  are ex-members of his organization. He wants to throw gay people off rooftops. He wants to bury
[02:41:04.960 --> 02:41:10.480]  women in the floor in the floor and smash rocks at their heads. And I want to stop him. And somehow,
[02:41:10.480 --> 02:41:16.960]  that puts us on the same level. And I've watched as they've upped it and upped it and upped it.
[02:41:16.960 --> 02:41:24.000]  And even now, with Brittany Pettibone, who's a young American girl, her and her partner
[02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:29.760]  would flew into the UK four or five days ago. They were held at customs. They were arrested.
[02:41:29.760 --> 02:41:35.200]  They were detained and put into detention center full of Muslims for three days before they were
[02:41:35.200 --> 02:41:43.840]  deported. Now, the Home Office said the reason she was not allowed in, the reason she was detained,
[02:41:43.840 --> 02:41:48.880]  and the reason she was deported was because she was coming to interview Tommy Robinson.
[02:41:49.840 --> 02:41:56.080]  She's coming to interview me. So that's what happened with her. Today, they've just held Lauren
[02:41:56.080 --> 02:42:04.080]  Southern, and they've deported her and banned her from our country again. So I've watched as
[02:42:04.080 --> 02:42:10.560]  everything, they're up in the ante, and they're trying to build me up as a preacher of hate
[02:42:10.560 --> 02:42:14.240]  with zero evidence. That's right. Stay there. We've got to go to break. This is critical.
[02:42:14.960 --> 02:42:21.040]  Brittany Pettibone held for four days. Lauren Southern held as terrorist. This is, they even
[02:42:21.040 --> 02:42:26.160]  have the printouts. They're not racist to any of that stuff. They're part of a free speech group,
[02:42:26.160 --> 02:42:30.720]  and we have the footage of in Europe when they get kicked back out of England, coming back,
[02:42:30.720 --> 02:42:35.120]  and Tommy went there to interview him. He is a busy man. Let me tell you something. I admire him.
[02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:40.320]  I mean, he made me feel so strong when I saw him in that video this weekend fight. It gave me a lot
[02:42:40.320 --> 02:42:45.680]  of strength, and it flipped something in my mind. It just let me know just how bad our enemies are
[02:42:45.680 --> 02:42:54.640]  and just how dedicated they are to enslaving us. We'll be back as humanity awakens. Stay with us.
[02:42:55.520 --> 02:43:00.560]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of
[02:43:00.560 --> 02:43:05.680]  seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify
[02:43:05.680 --> 02:43:11.360]  the body. That's why I'm introducing Z Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support. It's
[02:43:11.360 --> 02:43:17.040]  made in the USA. It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with
[02:43:17.040 --> 02:43:23.120]  detoxifying the body and it supports the M4. It is a classical 360 win. This is the formula that I
[02:43:23.120 --> 02:43:28.320]  personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection
[02:43:28.320 --> 02:43:32.720]  when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get. You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your
[02:43:32.720 --> 02:43:38.080]  family, and you owe it to the future of this country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and

[02:43:44.480 --> 02:43:48.560]  those brush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be. Thanks to your

[02:46:55.360 --> 02:47:13.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:47:13.200 --> 02:47:33.600]  We've been working on a plan to get Paul Watson and Tommy Robinson together
[02:47:34.240 --> 02:47:39.440]  because Paul is amazing. He probably reaches as many people as I do and I had to tell him six
[02:47:39.440 --> 02:47:43.280]  years ago, I said, listen, I'm cutting your pay in half. He doesn't do it for money. That's the
[02:47:43.280 --> 02:47:49.600]  problem to me. All he does is work and he's so humbled that he didn't want to be on air and I
[02:47:49.600 --> 02:47:54.800]  said, Paul, you're super articulate. His brother's got a PhD in international affairs. This is
[02:47:54.800 --> 02:47:59.280]  smart as Paul. He doesn't even want to be seen or heard because he's just so humble. Steve Watson
[02:47:59.280 --> 02:48:05.760]  just as smart as Paul and he just wants to run his folk festival music festivals. He
[02:48:05.760 --> 02:48:09.280]  runs some pretty big festivals. He's successful in that right. He writes articles for Infowars.
[02:48:09.280 --> 02:48:13.040]  But I told Paul, I said, you're going on air. And I said, here's your website. Here's your
[02:48:13.040 --> 02:48:17.040]  Twitter account. He had no followers or nobody on it. I said, here it is called Present Planet.
[02:48:17.040 --> 02:48:22.240]  He didn't even want it to be named after him. He said, oh, it's too much fancy. If it's my name,
[02:48:22.240 --> 02:48:27.360]  let's say it's by the scenes. I'll just maybe present on it to make one for me. And I said,
[02:48:27.360 --> 02:48:33.840]  okay, you're doing it. So maybe we can get this guy from London. They're a little more aggressive,
[02:48:33.840 --> 02:48:39.600]  teamed up with Paul, the little Northern Viking. So we'll get the Brittany, you know,
[02:48:39.600 --> 02:48:43.360]  with the Viking from the north and we'll get something going here. Because these two are
[02:48:43.360 --> 02:48:47.920]  going to be the dynamic duo, especially with his crew. And by the way, Lucy Brown, you know,
[02:48:47.920 --> 02:48:51.840]  I was watching the footage in fast motion. She has gray hair. I think maybe that's that style,
[02:48:51.840 --> 02:48:54.800]  because she's actually an attractive looking woman. Now that I pause it, I was saying,
[02:48:54.800 --> 02:48:59.840]  here's Antifa attacking an old lady. But then I started watching, tell us about Lucy Brown,
[02:48:59.840 --> 02:49:04.400]  tell us about all this and then other tidbits of what happened when the cameras were knocked out
[02:49:04.400 --> 02:49:07.680]  of your hands. I think you said for several minutes what happened there and then into the
[02:49:07.680 --> 02:49:12.720]  reporters that were kidnapped for four days for trying to enter the country to talk to you.
[02:49:13.760 --> 02:49:19.440]  That's it. So I met Lucy and I met George and Reagan, which is our team. I met them on an
[02:49:19.440 --> 02:49:24.480]  interview actually. I met them on a discussion a year ago. And then if people look, any of my
[02:49:24.480 --> 02:49:30.880]  viewers will know, look at videos we've done in the last four weeks. You've exploded. You've
[02:49:30.880 --> 02:49:37.840]  exploded. It's like a bowling ball was taken off your leg or right? We're back. Yeah, we're back.
[02:49:37.840 --> 02:49:41.760]  Because we exploded when we first started working together. We exploded as soon as we first come
[02:49:41.760 --> 02:49:46.720]  together for Rebel. But then there was, um, there was whatever happens. Not as far back, but
[02:49:47.680 --> 02:49:52.400]  I get it. Rebel doesn't want you to get killed. You're a great patriot, a star, but you're a
[02:49:52.400 --> 02:49:56.000]  warrior. So you're, you're staying out the streets. I'm not, I mean, I understand, you know, why you
[02:49:56.000 --> 02:49:59.120]  guys had friction because, you know, they didn't want to get you killed. I don't want to get you
[02:49:59.120 --> 02:50:02.640]  killed either. That's why I want to get enough capital in to get you some security, brother.
[02:50:02.640 --> 02:50:05.200]  You and Paul, because you guys are going to hit the ground running.
[02:50:06.400 --> 02:50:12.320]  Yeah, that's it. The stories, the stories me around the street, the stories around the street.
[02:50:12.320 --> 02:50:16.880]  And to be honest, I'll, yeah, see, even in last four weeks, people can probably even sense of
[02:50:16.880 --> 02:50:22.160]  myself. I'm happy doing this. I'm happy. I'm happy. I feel like I'm doing what I wanted to be doing
[02:50:22.160 --> 02:50:27.680]  again. And, um, yeah, I'm happy. And I'm not, yeah, I'm happy. So I'm happy because I know
[02:50:27.680 --> 02:50:32.240]  it's having an effect. It's having a change. Well, I want you to know your spirit gives me
[02:50:32.240 --> 02:50:36.240]  incredible energy. And now that you're turning it loose, I'm not kidding. I feel stronger and I'm
[02:50:36.240 --> 02:50:42.400]  more aggressive and, and, and, and have more hope because of you. That's a good fit. Well,
[02:50:42.400 --> 02:50:46.240]  I get that when I meet members of the public and I see how much it means to them and I see the
[02:50:46.240 --> 02:50:51.440]  reaction to get off them. It empowers me, empowers me and to know that, to know that it's making
[02:50:51.440 --> 02:50:55.840]  a difference. But that's the, when I, when I come on, when I was on your show last week, I spoke
[02:50:55.840 --> 02:51:03.040]  about how we had the upper hand in 2016. We had the media. We had the social media. We took it,
[02:51:03.040 --> 02:51:07.440]  we used it and the authorities and the system, the globalists did not know what to do with it.
[02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:12.800]  But now they're taking it back. They're re, they're regaining them, pulling back their power.
[02:51:12.800 --> 02:51:16.640]  They're, whether it be taking my blue tick off, I was suspended from Twitter last week for seven
[02:51:16.640 --> 02:51:22.400]  days just for simply stating a fact. I see the situation coming in the next 12 months,
[02:51:22.400 --> 02:51:27.520]  where I'm completely removed from social media completely. And that's the, that's the, that's
[02:51:27.520 --> 02:51:32.560]  the- And that's why we've now got to all team up to magnify everything here, because we've
[02:51:32.560 --> 02:51:37.520]  gotten so big, they're having trouble actually deleting us. Absolutely. So this is critical.
[02:51:38.560 --> 02:51:41.920]  Yeah, you've got, you've got to a stage where they can't, they can't get rid of you. But what
[02:51:41.920 --> 02:51:45.120]  they're witnessing with me, the reason why they've just done this with Lauren Southern,
[02:51:45.120 --> 02:51:49.840]  what they, what was insane is they've welcomed all these immigrants in, they've welcomed ISIS
[02:51:49.840 --> 02:51:54.400]  fighters back. I spoke yesterday and said- They put them in lugs, they put them in the best
[02:51:54.400 --> 02:52:00.560]  section eight housing, tell folks. One of the men, well, there was a man in Italy,
[02:52:00.560 --> 02:52:05.440]  he's a Moroccan living in Italy. He tried to fight for ISIS. He was stopped. He told the
[02:52:05.440 --> 02:52:10.960]  border agency, I want to become a terrorist. And then three months later, after all of his details
[02:52:10.960 --> 02:52:15.680]  were put on the European database to be watched, he just strolled straight into London, moved to
[02:52:15.680 --> 02:52:21.360]  our country. Now think about that. He tried to join ISIS. He wants to be a terrorist. Our border
[02:52:21.360 --> 02:52:27.840]  staff didn't stop him, didn't arrest him, but they stopped Brittany Pettibone. They stopped
[02:52:27.840 --> 02:52:34.640]  Lauren Southern. They didn't stop him. He went on to kill eight people and injure 48. We've had
[02:52:34.640 --> 02:52:42.080]  last week a Pakistani preacher who is banned from every mosque in Pakistan. He's banned from
[02:52:42.080 --> 02:52:48.400]  preaching in Pakistan. He flies into my country and he's touring the mosques of our country,
[02:52:48.400 --> 02:52:55.520]  giving radical sermons, insulting murder upon people, but don't worry because our border agency
[02:52:55.520 --> 02:53:00.400]  have got Lauren Southern. So everything's all right. So what the reality is-
[02:53:00.400 --> 02:53:04.480]  Because the globalists, it's all in the UN plan. They admit they're going to bring in
[02:53:04.480 --> 02:53:09.200]  Islam as their enforcer. They get Christianity gone so that you have no culture, even if you
[02:53:09.200 --> 02:53:12.960]  don't believe in God, folks. The point is, it's an operating system for them. They get rid of that,
[02:53:12.960 --> 02:53:17.520]  so you have no culture, then they bring in the new culture and they make you submit to it. And
[02:53:17.520 --> 02:53:23.360]  it's all in the Peter Sutherland, UN globalist, uh, Junker, the unelected, you know, dictator of the
[02:53:23.360 --> 02:53:28.400]  EU, the heir to the Nazi fortune. That's what I mean. You cannot make this up. You cannot make
[02:53:28.400 --> 02:53:33.600]  up how evil they are. Now I want to play this clip from where you are in Europe. Set up this clip
[02:53:33.600 --> 02:53:39.280]  of, uh, Pettibone, Brittany Pettibone and her boyfriend, uh, coming out. You've got the folks
[02:53:39.280 --> 02:53:44.080]  there in German, uh, you know, chanting about free speech, media's calling them. They're rot
[02:53:44.080 --> 02:53:50.240]  Nazis. All they are is a free speech coalition group and demonizing, uh, folks speech. So set
[02:53:50.240 --> 02:53:57.680]  this up. We'll play the clip. Again, was this Austria or was this Germany where they flew back
[02:53:57.680 --> 02:54:02.560]  into? This was they were getting deported to Austria. So Brittany was coming to interview me.
[02:54:02.560 --> 02:54:06.560]  She was arrested, held, detained, and they were deporting her. So I thought it was important
[02:54:06.560 --> 02:54:12.080]  that we were waiting for her in, in Austria. So as she come through the airport, and if I'm honest,
[02:54:12.080 --> 02:54:19.360]  it was a beautiful moment. When they returned and I looked and I saw probably up 50 to 100 people
[02:54:19.360 --> 02:54:25.120]  who were greeting them at the airport, who were singing a song about free speech and free thought.
[02:54:25.120 --> 02:54:30.400]  And I realized what it meant to these people, what the values of freedom of speech meant to them.
[02:54:30.400 --> 02:54:38.560]  And then I felt humiliated that my country has just attained this couple that Martin Selner
[02:54:38.560 --> 02:54:43.040]  and Brittany Fettivan, they've been detained, they've been imprisoned, and now they've been deported.
[02:54:43.040 --> 02:54:49.280]  He, Martin Selner, who's Brittany's partner, he was coming to give a speech at Speaker's Corner.
[02:54:49.280 --> 02:54:54.720]  Speaker's Corner, for anyone who doesn't know in London, there's 300 years of history. It's where
[02:54:54.720 --> 02:54:59.280]  it's known as where you can go and say whatever you want. So now you realize that your own country,
[02:54:59.280 --> 02:55:03.440]  let's play the clip as a time, you now realize your own country is going pure authoritarian,
[02:55:03.440 --> 02:55:07.200]  where actual Brits and others have no speech, or Canadians coming in to speak.
[02:55:07.200 --> 02:55:12.240]  You have no speech, but the foreign invaders do, backed up by your Islamic mayor in the globalist.
[02:55:12.240 --> 02:55:21.520]  Let's go to that clip. Hey, how you doing? Welcome home. Welcome home, Brittany. Welcome home,
[02:55:21.520 --> 02:55:30.880]  how are you? Fine, thank you. You've got quite a reception waiting for you. Yeah, wow. Okay, we didn't accept back that. Wow, amazing.
[02:55:30.880 --> 02:55:35.280]  Can I ask, how are you feeling? I'm just thankful for all the people who supported us, everybody who
[02:55:35.280 --> 02:55:40.240]  tweeted, people who made demonstrations in front of embassies, and especially the brave guys who
[02:55:40.240 --> 02:55:46.080]  went to speech corners today. They're the backbone of our resistance. Can you briefly tell us what
[02:55:46.080 --> 02:55:51.760]  happened? Yeah, so it was separate for us. So he was denied entry for a different reason. I was
[02:55:51.760 --> 02:55:56.960]  denied entry because I said I was going to interview you. And so I have the immigration statement,
[02:55:56.960 --> 02:56:01.360]  I'll show it to you. And it says you're denied entry because you want to interview far right
[02:56:01.360 --> 02:56:08.080]  activist, far right extremist, Tommy Robinson, who incites racial hatred. And so Martin actually
[02:56:08.080 --> 02:56:12.400]  mentioned, he was like, why don't you let her through and she can do her interviews and I won't go
[02:56:12.400 --> 02:56:16.960]  and then the event won't take place. So it'll be fine. They're like, her situation's worse because
[02:56:16.960 --> 02:56:22.640]  she's going to interview Tommy. Yeah, we wanted to give her a speech about freedom of speech there,
[02:56:22.640 --> 02:56:27.040]  but they wouldn't even let us go through a speaker's corner. And I think sometimes
[02:56:27.040 --> 02:56:32.400]  a speech you don't give speaks more. This is beautiful, a beautiful reception.
[02:56:32.400 --> 02:56:47.920]  So let's talk about what happened. Germany lost 22 million people in World War Two,
[02:56:47.920 --> 02:56:52.480]  getting swindled into that war by Hitler and the globalist. We're going to break
[02:56:52.480 --> 02:56:57.680]  them back with Mr. Robinson, the third fourth hour here. But now the left can't stop,
[02:56:57.680 --> 02:57:01.600]  they bring people in, they do race based garbage. And when people try to resist it,
[02:57:01.600 --> 02:57:05.680]  they say, you have no right to exist. And the Green Party and all of them in Germany say,
[02:57:05.680 --> 02:57:09.280]  it's time to get rid of white people. They're inherently evil. And then when people,
[02:57:09.280 --> 02:57:14.720]  young people come together and say, no, that's not true, then they call them Nazis and say
[02:57:14.720 --> 02:57:19.520]  they have no speech. This is a globalist plan to destroy all culture, exploit the third world,
[02:57:19.520 --> 02:57:24.080]  everybody. It's an admitted plan. And they hate Mr. Robinson because he goes and speaks to the
[02:57:24.080 --> 02:57:28.560]  black African groups and he goes and speaks to the Sikhs and everybody else and is open for all
[02:57:28.560 --> 02:57:32.880]  that as long as you're for everybody else's freedom. Everybody else is compatible, but the
[02:57:32.880 --> 02:57:37.600]  Islamists and the left are allied with. We'll be back, ladies and gentlemen, we need your support,

[02:59:43.440 --> 02:59:48.240]  defense of our republic and freedom worldwide.
[02:59:49.120 --> 03:00:00.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:00.240 --> 03:00:26.000]  All right. Tommy Robinson is on fire. He's with us at least another 30 minutes. Then we're going to
[03:00:26.000 --> 03:00:30.880]  have Rob Dew, Owen Schreuer, Jake Lloyd, our reporters at the scene of the third bombing
[03:00:31.680 --> 03:00:37.440]  two today, one a week ago in Austin, Texas. It looks like anti-tentrification attacks. The
[03:00:37.440 --> 03:00:40.640]  reason I say that is they've said they're going to start attacking and bombing and shooting.
[03:00:40.640 --> 03:00:46.720]  They've already attacked old people, cat cafes, weird method, white people leading usually
[03:00:46.720 --> 03:00:51.040]  mentally ill minorities. I'm not just saying that. It's usually like mentally ill minorities led
[03:00:51.040 --> 03:00:55.280]  by white people, communists. So I'm not like just trying to version signal towards the minorities
[03:00:55.280 --> 03:01:00.400]  that are the majority now, most curious. It's communist white dirtbags leading it. Okay.
[03:01:00.400 --> 03:01:04.560]  And that's what it is. And then they're funded by big foundations and drive around in Jaguars and
[03:01:04.560 --> 03:01:09.280]  Mercedes. And when we looked up some of these people, we infiltrated some of their meetings,
[03:01:09.280 --> 03:01:16.640]  we put some PIs on them and they're all rich kids. So I thought they were just
[03:01:16.640 --> 03:01:21.120]  meth heads or something in their mom's basement. No, these are corporate people. Their parents
[03:01:21.120 --> 03:01:25.040]  make a million dollars a year, half a million a year. One of them heads up Time Warner here
[03:01:25.040 --> 03:01:30.480]  in town. And then they're out there leading this crap. I mean, these are evil people. So yeah,
[03:01:30.480 --> 03:01:33.600]  we've been following you to your houses and stuff, start threatening our quarters and stuff.
[03:01:33.600 --> 03:01:37.360]  We've got at least 20 of the leadership of Antifa where you live, what you're doing.
[03:01:37.360 --> 03:01:41.120]  We're not playing games. Okay. And Tommy Robinson in playing games. I'm going to make an announcement
[03:01:41.120 --> 03:01:45.760]  coming up the next segment of this one short. But Tommy, other key tidbits about the Antifa
[03:01:45.760 --> 03:01:52.560]  attacking you, your female camera person, all of this stuff. You're talking about what happened
[03:01:52.560 --> 03:01:55.840]  when the cameras were knocked out of your hands? What were more on the missing minutes?
[03:01:56.800 --> 03:02:01.680]  So the missing minutes and the reality is we, you know, since since I went independent,
[03:02:01.680 --> 03:02:06.720]  so I went independent and everyone who's been working with me have been working me voluntarily
[03:02:07.280 --> 03:02:11.120]  because we didn't have funding and we didn't have support. So George, Kail and Lucy,
[03:02:11.120 --> 03:02:15.760]  and then we've been making do with not good equipment. So we weren't ready and our equipment
[03:02:15.760 --> 03:02:19.360]  weren't great. We should have body cams, we should have cameras on the cars, but we didn't have
[03:02:19.360 --> 03:02:24.080]  because we're just starting to get organized now. And don't get into too much details, but
[03:02:24.080 --> 03:02:28.800]  exactly. You don't even have money for solid state body cams. You guys have already infiltrated,
[03:02:28.800 --> 03:02:33.440]  we can't get into it, but then the system failed. Yeah, yeah, system failed. Yeah.
[03:02:33.440 --> 03:02:39.200]  Keep going. So we're hoping, we're hoping, yeah, basically without saying too much, we want to help
[03:02:39.200 --> 03:02:43.680]  or we want to do to Antifa when they're done to us. We want to make sure that everyone,
[03:02:43.680 --> 03:02:48.960]  is that what you said? I'll be honest with you. We had someone, two of their lead people,
[03:02:48.960 --> 03:02:52.640]  we've had people sat outside their houses with cameras, photographing them and them and their
[03:02:52.640 --> 03:02:56.800]  movements. And these people think they're invisible. They think that no one knows who they are or
[03:02:56.800 --> 03:03:00.160]  where they are. And they think that they can sit there and they can put people's addresses out
[03:03:00.160 --> 03:03:04.000]  and they can make threats to kill and murder and they can incite violence against anyone who has a
[03:03:04.000 --> 03:03:07.920]  different opinion without there being a, without there being a repercussion. And I don't, I'm not
[03:03:07.920 --> 03:03:12.720]  talking about, I'm not talking about violent repercussions. I'm talking about exposés on who
[03:03:12.720 --> 03:03:17.760]  they are and what they're up to. Well, if I told Antifa in Austin, who has now been watching them
[03:03:17.760 --> 03:03:23.360]  on their own time, they would crap their britches. I mean, former intelligence heads of the most elite
[03:03:23.360 --> 03:03:29.200]  military units, you name it, just are just tired of it. And I think though they're going to false
[03:03:29.200 --> 03:03:32.720]  flag their own people to blame us. So we don't want any violence against them. We're just going to
[03:03:32.720 --> 03:03:38.400]  catch them in crimes and make sure they go to prison. Yeah. And that's what, to be honest,
[03:03:38.400 --> 03:03:44.960]  I'd say I'd sit comfortably and say that those men that attacked us, they wouldn't have heard
[03:03:44.960 --> 03:03:50.480]  the end of it. So they will. And the thing is, they wear their masks, they hide their identity
[03:03:50.480 --> 03:03:54.400]  and they think they're invisible. And at some point, those masters are going to get pulled down
[03:03:54.960 --> 03:03:58.800]  and they're going to have cameras in their faces. And then we're going to see what the men they are.
[03:03:59.920 --> 03:04:03.840]  Well, you're too strong. You're too dedicated. You're too focused. You're too manly.
[03:04:04.560 --> 03:04:08.480]  You got to worry about the government that's been hijacked by the globalists and the city,
[03:04:08.480 --> 03:04:16.400]  Khan, the city you live in. They're so arrogant. I think they're going to probably try to kill you.
[03:04:16.400 --> 03:04:19.200]  They don't understand. I'll turn you into a martyr, but they just don't get it. Go ahead.
[03:04:19.200 --> 03:04:25.600]  Sorry. Yeah. What they've done is so they let terrorists in. They know who these terrorists are.
[03:04:25.600 --> 03:04:29.840]  They watch them. They do nothing. They let them blow things up. They're all on the watch list.
[03:04:29.840 --> 03:04:35.280]  And then they, so then they use those crimes and those terrorist attacks to bring in new laws
[03:04:35.280 --> 03:04:39.840]  to take away more freedom. And then those laws that they bring in, they use against us.
[03:04:40.640 --> 03:04:45.920]  They put on us. They put on Lauren Southern. She's held under the terrorism act today,
[03:04:45.920 --> 03:04:49.280]  arrested under terrorist legislation and deported from our country.
[03:04:50.560 --> 03:04:53.680]  Meanwhile, bearded jihadi should stroll back. That's right. Stay right there.
[03:04:54.880 --> 03:04:59.360]  In Full Wars Life is launching its newest product. We're really, really proud of it.

[03:06:20.720 --> 03:06:41.520]  Imagine a whole gang of thugs training with communist Islamists at a mosque,
[03:06:41.520 --> 03:06:45.600]  learn from one of their operatives that Tommy Robinson is at a McDonald's with his camera lady
[03:06:46.400 --> 03:06:50.320]  and then they come over and attack the woman to get the camera, viciously start beating her.
[03:06:50.320 --> 03:06:55.760]  She fights back. He fights back. Then they run as cowardly scum and the police are all there and
[03:06:55.760 --> 03:06:59.840]  do nothing. Tommy Robinson is our guest at the bottom of the hour. Then we have reporters on
[03:06:59.840 --> 03:07:03.920]  the scene of the third bombing in Austin. You cannot make this up. So we're going to talk
[03:07:03.920 --> 03:07:08.880]  to Owen Schreuer, then Rob Do, and of course, Jake Lloyd. And then this has been in the works for
[03:07:08.880 --> 03:07:15.040]  six months. I want to publish his book, Muhammad's Korea. That's already a best seller in Europe
[03:07:15.040 --> 03:07:19.280]  here in the U.S. because I want you to hear what Muhammad actually said. And then I want to hire
[03:07:19.280 --> 03:07:23.360]  him. But I said, let me finish up with all this stuff because I know the budget. I just can't
[03:07:23.360 --> 03:07:28.800]  wait. They keep hitting us with other torpedoes. We're moving forward. That's why I gave $20,000
[03:07:28.800 --> 03:07:33.440]  to Project Veritas because they do incredibly great work. And the lawyers told me, they said,
[03:07:33.440 --> 03:07:38.080]  the footage they have of the New York Times and YouTube and Google and Twitter and Facebook saying,
[03:07:38.080 --> 03:07:42.720]  you're public enemy number one, Alex Jones is the enemy, plus anybody else that spreads American
[03:07:42.720 --> 03:07:47.360]  flags. They said, well, we banned Alex Jones or anything like him or anything like American flags.
[03:07:47.360 --> 03:07:52.160]  We hate the America. I mean, it's on video. These are globalists. And then a lot of people that
[03:07:52.160 --> 03:07:55.680]  used to even be listeners, they go, oh, I'll be promoted by YouTube and make money by attack
[03:07:55.680 --> 03:08:01.760]  Alex Jones. So they flip. And then people think, oh, look, you're being censored. You're not winning.
[03:08:01.760 --> 03:08:05.520]  No, I am winning. I'm changing the world. The way people think about only themselves,
[03:08:06.240 --> 03:08:10.080]  it's like, if you had neighbors upstream, this is the point that Nugent made last week when I was
[03:08:10.080 --> 03:08:13.360]  at his house and they're crapping in the river and it's coming down to your house. They don't have
[03:08:13.360 --> 03:08:19.360]  a right to do that. Okay. And that's where we are. So we're changing the world. We expect to get
[03:08:19.360 --> 03:08:23.280]  attacked. They're always like, ah, we're going to kill you. We're going to shut you up. We're like,
[03:08:23.280 --> 03:08:27.440]  we get that. Hey, we're here to stop you. So all these innocents don't get run over. It's an instinct.
[03:08:27.440 --> 03:08:31.040]  It's a spirit. It's not like trying to be a hero. You can't roll over when you see him kidnap the
[03:08:31.040 --> 03:08:34.960]  little girls like he did in his town. He owned a tanning bed company, was making money, middle
[03:08:34.960 --> 03:08:39.440]  class, and I had a big nice house. I know Robin's store. I remember he was in demonization about
[03:08:39.440 --> 03:08:43.920]  him 10 years ago and halfway believing it in my own self. They took this house, they put him in
[03:08:43.920 --> 03:08:48.000]  prison. They tried to kill him. Now he's stronger than ever. So he's not doing this for his own
[03:08:48.000 --> 03:08:52.800]  self. He's doing it because the town he was in, it turned out 4,000 little girls were groomed for
[03:08:52.800 --> 03:08:57.040]  sex. Many of them kidnapped. Many of them killed. Many of them disappeared. This is a evil British
[03:08:57.040 --> 03:09:01.200]  pedophile government ally with Islam because under its tenets of radical Islam, it follows
[03:09:01.200 --> 03:09:07.120]  pedophilia. Everybody knows about the giant scams, the pedophilia in England, the secret dungeons,
[03:09:07.120 --> 03:09:10.880]  the torture, the murder of little kids, Prime Minister's slit little girls' throats. All that's
[03:09:10.880 --> 03:09:17.200]  coming out. The BBC is basically a giant pedophile cult. So, I mean, London Telegraph,
[03:09:17.200 --> 03:09:23.360]  pedophile cult runs UK, cannot be released, will destroy national security. That's a headline.
[03:09:23.360 --> 03:09:29.840]  That's top police saying we're run by pedophiles who are devil worshipers. You cannot make that up.
[03:09:30.400 --> 03:09:35.040]  What are harems? They're slave pits of women. Yeah, and Muhammad had sex with a nine-year-old,
[03:09:35.040 --> 03:09:39.680]  so Turkey's legalizing sex with nine-year-olds right now. You cannot make this up. So,
[03:09:41.440 --> 03:09:45.920]  I'm going to donate $20,000 we don't have because we did last year, we bought it even more capital
[03:09:45.920 --> 03:09:50.720]  than we did the election year. We thought that was crazy. But because we sold stuff at such low
[03:09:50.720 --> 03:09:55.520]  prices, we brought in less money aggregate. But this year, it's accelerated because I just cut
[03:09:55.520 --> 03:10:01.840]  prices too much last day of the sale, free shipping, and 30 to 80 percent off all these best
[03:10:01.840 --> 03:10:05.600]  sellers, the average 50 percent off. It's gone again because we're selling out the stuff and
[03:10:05.600 --> 03:10:09.760]  Tim Frasier explained, he said, yeah, this is the most money we ever brought in, but it's only five
[03:10:09.760 --> 03:10:15.200]  percent money we keep. Alex, you got to stop. We got some other great sales tomorrow, but take
[03:10:15.200 --> 03:10:20.160]  advantage of these. Go click the support us donate button. But I'm giving $20,000 because I've learned
[03:10:20.160 --> 03:10:24.400]  they got a bunch of crappy cameras. They don't have body cams. They need it. They can get even
[03:10:24.400 --> 03:10:31.600]  better intel. So, I'm giving the directive right now to wire to Tommy Robinson, $20,000
[03:10:31.600 --> 03:10:36.160]  by tomorrow so they can get the equipment they need. They've got them trying to break in their
[03:10:36.160 --> 03:10:40.400]  houses, surveilling them, trying to infiltrate them. I mean, it's been amazing what's been going
[03:10:40.400 --> 03:10:44.720]  on to these guys. But it's like a James Bond movie. But this is the real world where the real
[03:10:44.720 --> 03:10:50.400]  James Bond have $200 cameras that are broken. So, I'm sitting $20,000. Sounds like a lot.
[03:10:50.400 --> 03:10:55.120]  It's not. Takes a lot to do all this. But I need you to go to his website. Let's put it on screen
[03:10:55.120 --> 03:11:02.160]  because he's got a new website. It's Tommy Robinson. Now, there's the website. What is the best
[03:11:02.160 --> 03:11:06.560]  places you've got a lot of these? Is it Tommy Robinson dot online, that awesome site?
[03:11:09.600 --> 03:11:13.440]  Okay, let's fade his audio back up because he didn't have his audio faded up. I'm going to get
[03:11:13.440 --> 03:11:18.960]  this right this time. What's the best website, Tommy? Tommy Robinson dot online and Alex,
[03:11:18.960 --> 03:11:23.280]  you'll get value for money because you know, like, since going independent, we haven't got the funds
[03:11:23.280 --> 03:11:29.360]  and even, even like this Sunday, because they stopped, because they stopped my and Selna speaking
[03:11:29.360 --> 03:11:33.600]  in London and they deported him, I've said they may have stopped the speaker, but they won't stop
[03:11:33.600 --> 03:11:38.960]  the speech. So, I'm going to go to speakers corner with 300 years of history at speakers corner.
[03:11:38.960 --> 03:11:43.040]  Some of the most controversial figures in our country's history have spoke there from George
[03:11:43.040 --> 03:11:49.600]  Orwell to Karl Marx and our government think they can stop that. They, speakers corner has been taken
[03:11:49.600 --> 03:11:55.360]  over by radical Islamic jihadists. That's the only people that go there to promote their religion.
[03:11:55.360 --> 03:12:00.800]  Well, this Sunday at three o'clock, the battle for speakers corner begins. Now, I know I'm going
[03:12:00.800 --> 03:12:05.440]  there and but we don't have the money or we didn't have the money to get proper security. You've just
[03:12:05.440 --> 03:12:09.200]  given us the money to get proper security. So, thank you very much. We can also get the proper
[03:12:09.200 --> 03:12:14.320]  equipment and I guarantee you people see value for money with the money you've given us because
[03:12:14.320 --> 03:12:18.640]  we're going to get straight back out there. Let's be clear. We haven't even struck an operational
[03:12:18.640 --> 03:12:22.720]  plan. We've come up for six months to try to get you the proper studio and, you know, do the right
[03:12:22.720 --> 03:12:29.280]  things. I don't want to step on Rebels toes. So, now you can work with us. But expanding on that,
[03:12:29.280 --> 03:12:34.160]  Tommy, it is critical that everybody else donate because that is just a drop in the bucket. So,
[03:12:34.160 --> 03:12:41.520]  let me give people the website. Again, it's Tommy Robinson dot online, whether it's $5, $25 or,
[03:12:41.520 --> 03:12:45.440]  you know, 50 pounds, because it's in pounded nominations. They're on PayPal. Get in there,
[03:12:45.440 --> 03:12:50.880]  folks. Donate today because this is front line Patriots completely outnumbered in the last
[03:12:50.880 --> 03:12:54.640]  ditch effort. But people are responding. They're getting involved. What they're scared of is your
[03:12:54.640 --> 03:12:59.280]  leadership. You know, your marches through no-go zones and the fact that only Muslims are allowed
[03:12:59.280 --> 03:13:03.840]  to have free speech. Now in the UK, I've seen it myself where Muslims are allowed to speak,
[03:13:03.840 --> 03:13:09.840]  but nobody else is. This has to be stood up against. This is absolutely devastating. So,
[03:13:09.840 --> 03:13:15.120]  again, people need to go to your website. And that's voice first, Alex, because, you know,
[03:13:15.120 --> 03:13:19.280]  if it wasn't for organisations and channels like yourself, it wasn't for people like yourself.
[03:13:19.280 --> 03:13:22.720]  And the only way you know, you're getting up, you're coming under attack from everywhere.
[03:13:22.720 --> 03:13:26.640]  Every legal suit they can do, they can sue you to try and bring you down financially,
[03:13:26.640 --> 03:13:30.240]  destroy you. That's what they're doing. They're doing exactly the same to all the people. And
[03:13:30.240 --> 03:13:34.240]  the only way they'll survive is with the public support. So, whether that be on my website or
[03:13:34.240 --> 03:13:39.680]  join on InfoWars and all the things that you're doing or on your shop is what helps you do it,
[03:13:39.680 --> 03:13:44.000]  but not just by helping you do it. You give people like myself and people across Europe and people
[03:13:44.000 --> 03:13:48.880]  across the world who don't have a platform. If it wasn't for organisations or alternative media,
[03:13:48.880 --> 03:13:52.640]  first giving me interviews and giving me platforms, we wouldn't have got up there.
[03:13:52.640 --> 03:13:57.280]  So whilst you're asking people to support us, you've just given us 20,000 pounds,
[03:13:57.280 --> 03:14:00.480]  you've given us the opportunity, so I'd rather people were supporting InfoWars
[03:14:00.480 --> 03:14:05.120]  and helping them grow and get bigger and, as you said, change the world.
[03:14:06.000 --> 03:14:08.960]  And, you know, something we need to do is when these donations come in, we need to give people
[03:14:08.960 --> 03:14:12.000]  credit when they want it, kind of like Ron Paul used to do. We don't even have the infrastructure.
[03:14:12.000 --> 03:14:15.040]  I love, we can team up. Whoever's building your websites, we want to watch some new ones
[03:14:15.040 --> 03:14:19.280]  that are really slick and nice like you've got. InfoWars is kind of informational.
[03:14:19.280 --> 03:14:22.720]  News Wars looks really good, but I like, you know, you have the look of your new site,
[03:14:22.720 --> 03:14:26.560]  the team you've got. And so when we get off air today, we're going to talk about it because
[03:14:26.560 --> 03:14:30.160]  I've waited too long. I'm trying to hire some other people. I'm just trying to budget it.
[03:14:30.160 --> 03:14:35.600]  So the listeners will just go to infowarsstore.com, buy the products, click on the support, donate to us.
[03:14:36.320 --> 03:14:40.160]  No, I mean, I gave $100,000 to help round up pedophiles and document that.
[03:14:40.160 --> 03:14:44.960]  That is a set to be come out on television. I don't have any stake in that. I'm not trying
[03:14:44.960 --> 03:14:48.800]  to make money off that production. I just knew that they were blocking what was happening.
[03:14:48.800 --> 03:14:54.800]  So I funded it. Same thing here, $20,000. Project Veritas is now giving us the keys
[03:14:54.800 --> 03:14:58.800]  to win these lawsuits with Google, Facebook, and Twitter admitting they're doing it because
[03:14:58.800 --> 03:15:03.040]  of our political views, not for what they claim. We now can win these lawsuits. We don't want to
[03:15:03.040 --> 03:15:07.920]  launch them. We have to to make them back off. We have to sue the people that filed false
[03:15:07.920 --> 03:15:13.680]  complaints. We have to sue folks that sue us saying, and we can't have a painting of Pepe
[03:15:13.680 --> 03:15:21.280]  the Frog. They're coming after our free speech. So infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com, and also
[03:15:21.280 --> 03:15:28.080]  go to Mr. Robin's website because it's critical for everybody to understand this is a war and
[03:15:28.080 --> 03:15:33.040]  people that are willing to risk their lives out there like Tommy Robinson, need your financial
[03:15:33.040 --> 03:15:37.760]  support today. And I'm not going to sit here while he does a great job in the field, but fumbles
[03:15:37.760 --> 03:15:41.680]  around trying to get money for year after year after year after year when they're trying to put
[03:15:41.680 --> 03:15:46.640]  his ass in prison. We need to give him the equipment he needs for the information war. So go there
[03:15:46.640 --> 03:15:51.200]  and donate today and also buy products that you need that are great at infowarsstore.com for
[03:15:51.200 --> 03:15:58.080]  shipping ends today. The answer to being in control of your own healthcare is freedom from

[03:17:59.520 --> 03:18:04.160]  enzymes assist in the digestive process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by
[03:18:04.160 --> 03:18:08.480]  breaking down foods into easily absorbable components. They also help prevent discomfort
[03:18:08.480 --> 03:18:12.880]  from a digestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut. Digestive
[03:18:12.880 --> 03:18:17.680]  enzyme production declines as we age. Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally
[03:18:17.680 --> 03:18:23.120]  present in the body. Enjoy the full potential of protein rich foods again. You can eat protein
[03:18:23.120 --> 03:18:28.080]  heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated

[03:18:33.280 --> 03:18:38.720]  and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles. Carnivore also contains
[03:18:38.720 --> 03:18:43.920]  digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates so you can fully digest all types

[03:18:57.680 --> 03:19:01.520]  on major third party sites is because I want products I'm going to use for my family. I take
[03:19:01.520 --> 03:19:06.000]  this. My family takes this and then it funds the operation with the most hardcore truthful
[03:19:06.000 --> 03:19:10.160]  information you're going to find anywhere. So what you find in our news is the same thing you find
[03:19:10.160 --> 03:19:16.080]  in our products at InfoWarsLife.com. If I ever forget to take them, like I'll I have a noticeable
[03:19:16.080 --> 03:19:21.520]  difference. I don't feel good. The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life changing for me.
[03:19:21.520 --> 03:19:26.720]  Yeah, I've actually have just run out of my superfemale. I had a few bottles at my house and I've
[03:19:26.720 --> 03:19:32.880]  been taking it again, hitting the gym once again. Very exciting, feeling great, looking good. So
[03:19:32.880 --> 03:19:39.200]  and I know my hair's luxurious once again. So obviously the superfemale is amazing. I love it.
[03:19:39.200 --> 03:19:45.040]  Nascent iodine is essential. Survival Shield X2. If there's one product that I would say is life
[03:19:45.040 --> 03:19:50.800]  changing that I would suggest it's nascent iodine Survival Shield X2. It's got a five star rating.
[03:19:50.800 --> 03:19:53.200]  It's a win-win InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:19:58.400 --> 03:20:01.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:20:01.040 --> 03:20:12.160]  All right, let's cut right into the broadcast. Alex Jones here. You're listening to us on radio
[03:20:12.160 --> 03:20:16.880]  stations and TV stations. You are getting past the sensors. They're trying to block us everywhere.
[03:20:16.880 --> 03:20:23.200]  We have Tommy Robinson joining us. We have Kailen, one of his amazing camera crew.
[03:20:24.080 --> 03:20:29.040]  I also want to get Lucy on, the woman who gave as good as she got with a cowardly ante for thugs,
[03:20:29.040 --> 03:20:34.160]  trying to climb on top of her. But during the break, I was asking Mr. Robinson what's coming
[03:20:34.160 --> 03:20:40.640]  next. And he was just telling me amazing things. I mean, he is just like Nigel Farage woke up people
[03:20:40.640 --> 03:20:46.320]  politically. This is the next Nigel Farage for the next level. And if you knew his story,
[03:20:46.320 --> 03:20:52.640]  it is incredible how he's fighting racism, how he founded the English defense league,
[03:20:52.640 --> 03:20:56.720]  and then it got represented by races. So he left it and exposed it. And he's just a great guy,
[03:20:56.720 --> 03:21:01.280]  a great father, a great patriot. He's gone through so much. He's got this great crew of people that
[03:21:01.280 --> 03:21:06.960]  I want to link up with Paul Joseph Watson, who again is so humble. He's just a rock star politically,
[03:21:06.960 --> 03:21:11.200]  you know, here in the US and the UK. When I've been in public with him in the UK, he gets mobbed.
[03:21:11.200 --> 03:21:16.320]  We have to use the popularity to culturally win, or they're going to shut us down in our houses.
[03:21:16.320 --> 03:21:21.680]  And Paul finally got that. He said, I know I got any more videos. I got to go on the street. It's
[03:21:21.680 --> 03:21:25.600]  true. I won't let them shut me down. So the fact they're trying to suppress him, he's a seed,
[03:21:25.600 --> 03:21:30.480]  he's going to grow. But I think when I team these guys up together, I mean, I think the
[03:21:30.480 --> 03:21:34.560]  strength of them is going to be frightening. And that's what I'm looking for. I'm looking like
[03:21:34.560 --> 03:21:39.600]  with Owen Schreuer and others, people that will surpass what I've done. That's true victory.
[03:21:39.600 --> 03:21:43.200]  We're not in competition with other media, any of it. We're in competition with tyranny to defeat
[03:21:43.200 --> 03:21:47.440]  it. So Tommy Robinson, and you tell me donations are coming in. I want to thank the listeners.
[03:21:47.440 --> 03:21:51.920]  That's great. And of course, Kalen, one of your great camera folks, you guys have got the floor
[03:21:51.920 --> 03:21:57.600]  for the last seven minutes. Tell us what's coming next. What's coming next? We want to build,
[03:21:57.600 --> 03:22:00.800]  we want to take over the media. That's what we want to do in Europe. We want to be the people.
[03:22:00.800 --> 03:22:04.960]  We already are. Every time there's a terrorist attack, my name trends, everyone searches for the
[03:22:04.960 --> 03:22:07.600]  truth. When they're searching for the truth, they're searching for us. And your average
[03:22:07.600 --> 03:22:11.600]  video gets 5 million views now. I mean, they're just seeing it doesn't have that in 10 hours.
[03:22:12.720 --> 03:22:17.280]  No, and that's why they're trying to silence us. That's why they're hating us. But one thing I'd
[03:22:17.280 --> 03:22:21.440]  like to say is, whilst I've got the opportunity on the platform, I wouldn't be able to do it
[03:22:21.440 --> 03:22:25.520]  with the people who support me. And I certainly wouldn't be able to have done any of the videos
[03:22:25.520 --> 03:22:29.280]  without Kalen, without George, without Lucy, because people give me the credit because they
[03:22:29.280 --> 03:22:32.880]  see me on the end of the camera, but they're risking their lives every time. They're walking
[03:22:32.880 --> 03:22:36.960]  into mosques for me. They're walking into hostile environments for me. They're coming under attack.
[03:22:36.960 --> 03:22:40.400]  George is coming under attack. Lucy come under attack. So they're putting their lives on the
[03:22:40.400 --> 03:22:45.280]  line and they don't really get any gratitude for it. In fact, they can slag off by people for it.
[03:22:45.280 --> 03:22:49.040]  So yeah. Yeah. So that's mine. So I wouldn't be able to do it without them guys. So yeah.
[03:22:49.040 --> 03:22:52.000]  But let me ask them a question then before you talk about what's coming next.
[03:22:52.960 --> 03:22:55.040]  Kalen, I'm familiar with your work with the last few years with Tommy.
[03:22:56.320 --> 03:23:00.080]  Where does this courage come from? Because they target you guys with the cameras first.
[03:23:00.080 --> 03:23:03.520]  I mean, what do you do when eight guys are trying to beat you up? I mean, you don't come off as like
[03:23:03.520 --> 03:23:07.840]  a hooligan or anything. Just a nice artistic type fellow. But I mean, I guess you're not going to
[03:23:07.840 --> 03:23:12.480]  let them suppress your speech. Is that it? Well, I think when you know that there's millions of
[03:23:12.480 --> 03:23:16.080]  people that are going to be behind the camera lens, you kind of feel a sense of courage anyway.
[03:23:16.080 --> 03:23:20.000]  And you know that what they're doing is wrong. And in general, what you're doing is right.
[03:23:20.000 --> 03:23:24.160]  What you're showing is right. What you're exposing is right. What you're saying is right.
[03:23:24.160 --> 03:23:28.080]  And so that sort of gives you a sense of courage of being able to just follow through with what's
[03:23:28.080 --> 03:23:32.160]  going to happen. Yeah, you might get seriously injured and things like that might happen. But
[03:23:32.160 --> 03:23:36.400]  you still have so many other people who are on site, who are watching what's going on and it is
[03:23:36.400 --> 03:23:41.920]  the right thing to do. And production value is our best weapon. That's the thing that we have
[03:23:41.920 --> 03:23:45.280]  that's blowing everyone else out of the water that's terrifying the mainstream media.
[03:23:45.280 --> 03:23:48.960]  And that's the number one thing that just drives me to do all of this. I used to work in
[03:23:49.680 --> 03:23:54.320]  in the mainstream media before this. And I just basically take their tactics and bring it here.
[03:23:54.320 --> 03:23:58.480]  And it's terrifying everyone. And yeah, that's where it all comes from. Because you know that
[03:23:58.480 --> 03:24:03.920]  regardless of what happens, regardless of how bad it gets, in the end, what you're doing is still
[03:24:03.920 --> 03:24:07.600]  the right thing. And I think we're still on the right side of history. And that's where it all
[03:24:07.600 --> 03:24:12.800]  comes from. And let's talk about real hard. I mean, I heard you 10 years ago, they said,
[03:24:12.800 --> 03:24:16.640]  oh, this racist, horrible guy has been put in prison. He says that they're grooming thousands
[03:24:16.640 --> 03:24:20.480]  of girls in his town for sex slavery. And then it came out later. A bunch of them got killed.
[03:24:20.480 --> 03:24:25.440]  They got shipped overseas. They chop them up and feed them to people out of kebab stands. I mean,
[03:24:25.440 --> 03:24:30.480]  I used to think you were crazy. And then it because who believes this about and then it's
[03:24:30.480 --> 03:24:36.000]  all true. And then now it's back in the news about grooming today. I mean, folks, Islamic
[03:24:36.000 --> 03:24:40.240]  countries are hellholes unless it's Jordan or something. I mean, and then they're seen as
[03:24:40.240 --> 03:24:45.680]  heretics. It's women can't drive cars. My God, they're selling women on slave blocks. Explain
[03:24:45.680 --> 03:24:50.160]  to people what we're up against. The grooming case has just come out today in the city of
[03:24:50.160 --> 03:24:55.280]  Telford. They've got 1000 victims. Telford's a small town. There's not many Muslims there.
[03:24:55.280 --> 03:25:00.240]  There's 1000 victims. We found out that five people, five, five people have been murdered.
[03:25:00.240 --> 03:25:05.920]  And it's all been covered up. It's all been covered up. One of the victims, they set fire to her,
[03:25:05.920 --> 03:25:10.320]  her sister and her mother. They burned them to death. The Muslim men that were raping them burned
[03:25:10.320 --> 03:25:14.800]  them to death. We're only just hearing about it now. This has been going on. By the way, I had them,
[03:25:14.800 --> 03:25:20.080]  I had them in my stacks. Finally, the BBC has to report inquiry call over Telford child sex
[03:25:20.080 --> 03:25:25.280]  exploitation. Boom. I mean, this is, explain how this happens. If the police won't touch the Muslims,
[03:25:25.280 --> 03:25:29.040]  so literally 50 year old men are grooming your nine year old daughters. Go ahead.
[03:25:29.840 --> 03:25:34.240]  The BBC have only just reported on that as you see one hour ago. They've been silent. This has
[03:25:34.240 --> 03:25:39.200]  been, other media have been talking about this for 24 hours. You broke this. You broke this 10
[03:25:39.200 --> 03:25:45.120]  years ago. Yeah. I remember going on a show with Jeremy Paxman. Jeremy Paxman was the biggest,
[03:25:45.120 --> 03:25:50.560]  most hostile interviewer in the country. And I sat and said to him, and people can watch back the
[03:25:50.560 --> 03:25:54.720]  video. I said, our daughters, not your daughters, our daughters, you don't know what we're talking
[03:25:54.720 --> 03:25:59.120]  about. We do. Our daughters, our sisters are being pimped. They're being beaten. They're being raped
[03:25:59.120 --> 03:26:04.000]  across this country by gangs of Muslim men. And he looked at me like I was stupid. He looked
[03:26:04.000 --> 03:26:08.800]  at me like I, and then years on. And I even remember after that, when I, when I, when I walked
[03:26:08.800 --> 03:26:13.120]  through Luton and I met another man, he said, out of all the things you could have spoke about,
[03:26:13.120 --> 03:26:17.040]  why did you speak about gangs of Muslim men targeting young English girls when,
[03:26:17.040 --> 03:26:21.360]  and he looked at me like that. And I see him, I see the same man years later. And he said,
[03:26:21.360 --> 03:26:26.880]  I can't believe it. I've watched everything, everything you spoke about. I said, because that,
[03:26:26.880 --> 03:26:31.440]  I had a conversation this week, Alex, with another father who I'm going to go meet at the end of the
[03:26:31.440 --> 03:26:36.640]  week, whose daughter was 12 years old. They were gang raping her. They took her into a park.
[03:26:36.640 --> 03:26:42.640]  They poured petrol over her pretending to set her on fire to terrify her. And this is another case.
[03:26:42.640 --> 03:26:47.120]  To put them into Stockholm. That's to put them assimilated. They'll do it with a gun or gasoline
[03:26:47.120 --> 03:26:51.520]  to put them into simulated Stockholm syndrome, to put them into the, to submit to them.
[03:26:52.720 --> 03:26:57.920]  Yeah, that's it. And this is not just, it's quite, it's not just about raping and raping
[03:26:57.920 --> 03:27:05.040]  the women for their sexual gratification. It's about destroying them. One girl, they took a tongue,
[03:27:05.040 --> 03:27:09.680]  12 years old, and they nailed it to a table. Another young girl, they got a hot iron rod
[03:27:09.680 --> 03:27:14.080]  with the lair M and they burned it and heated it and they scolded on her bum when she was 11 years
[03:27:14.080 --> 03:27:19.120]  old, because she was the property of Mohammed. And if you stop the average man in the British
[03:27:19.120 --> 03:27:24.160]  street, they won't even know that. They will not even know this has happened. And that is,
[03:27:24.160 --> 03:27:29.360]  that is the true crime. If a woman gets a hijab pulled off, it's on world news. Our daughters
[03:27:29.360 --> 03:27:33.520]  are getting scolded on their bum with the property of Mohammed. They're getting their tongues nailed
[03:27:33.520 --> 03:27:37.760]  to tables. They've been raped from one end of this country to the other. And we're supposed
[03:27:37.760 --> 03:27:42.320]  to just tolerate and put up with it. Because if not, we're racist or extremists. The Home Office
[03:27:42.320 --> 03:27:48.480]  are labelling me an extremist who incites religious and racial hatred for simply talking about these
[03:27:48.480 --> 03:27:54.080]  crimes because it's wrong and it has to be. And then let me raise this then. Now it's finally
[03:27:54.080 --> 03:27:59.200]  breaking another town, thousand girls, five of them dead, sex slavery, branding their asses,
[03:27:59.200 --> 03:28:03.600]  excuse me. I mean, this makes me want to go berserk. Why is it now breaking just because
[03:28:03.600 --> 03:28:08.800]  they can't hide it anymore? More people recognize it. It's coming out. Since 2009,
[03:28:08.800 --> 03:28:13.360]  if you look at the arrest rate, the arrest rate is a steady, a steady, a steady flow like this.
[03:28:13.360 --> 03:28:18.880]  And then the English Defense League falls and then it explodes because no longer when the world's
[03:28:18.880 --> 03:28:23.440]  media were coming into our streets, and then we're marching and screaming and shouting and
[03:28:23.440 --> 03:28:29.120]  holding up signs saying our daughters are not allowed me, they could hide it no longer. They
[03:28:29.120 --> 03:28:33.200]  done everything they could, but they could hide it no longer. And now the cats out of the bag,
[03:28:33.200 --> 03:28:38.240]  but they're still they haven't even scratched the top of their Tommy Robinson folks, one of the
[03:28:38.240 --> 03:28:41.680]  greatest living patriots with his great career. I want to get a final comment from both of them
[03:28:41.680 --> 03:28:46.400]  about what's coming next. This is a man and then we've got our reports, the scene of the third
[03:28:46.400 --> 03:28:49.920]  bombing, we've got multiple, we got deaths, we're gonna talk about it all here in Austin,
[03:28:49.920 --> 03:28:51.600]  probably communist bombings. Let's take a look at this.

[03:32:03.920 --> 03:32:09.600]  of your energy. They are your body's cellular engines. Cell Force helps promote your cellular
[03:32:09.600 --> 03:32:15.040]  energy production by supporting mitochondria, much like a cellular engine overhaul because when
[03:32:15.040 --> 03:32:21.040]  your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[03:32:21.600 --> 03:32:27.200]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these
[03:32:27.200 --> 03:32:33.360]  reactive oxygen species. The antioxidants found in Cell Force are some of the most powerful
[03:32:33.360 --> 03:32:38.720]  available on the market. The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these

[03:33:11.600 --> 03:33:18.960]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:19.520 --> 03:33:25.520]  And we now take you to the year 2018 where more than 10 million radical Islamists have
[03:33:25.520 --> 03:33:30.000]  been brought into Europe in just the last five years. The UK is desperately trying to pull out
[03:33:30.000 --> 03:33:35.360]  of the unelected EU, but the grandson of the most powerful Nazi industrial family who privately
[03:33:35.360 --> 03:33:41.200]  owns Luxembourg via German paratroopers taking it has pledged to break up the United States
[03:33:41.200 --> 03:33:49.040]  and defeat Trump. This isn't fiction. This is March 12, 2018. I'm Alex Jones. We've had three
[03:33:49.040 --> 03:33:54.640]  bombings in the last week, two-to-day fatalities. We've got people injured. We've got just a mile
[03:33:54.640 --> 03:34:00.480]  from our warehouse, not our broadcast facility, but our warehouse. A bomb has gone off. We've
[03:34:00.480 --> 03:34:05.120]  got our crew there. We're about to go to them. I'm not saying Antifa did it, but they're a violent
[03:34:05.120 --> 03:34:08.560]  group. It says they're going to attack people that are gentrified, whether they be black,
[03:34:08.560 --> 03:34:12.240]  white, or Hispanic, if they're not from the neighborhood. They're attacking cat sanctuaries,
[03:34:12.240 --> 03:34:17.040]  physically attacking people, mugging people. They are just the filth of the earth, just vicious
[03:34:17.040 --> 03:34:22.640]  people with Satan tattoos and hammers and sickle tattoos. And I'm not saying tattoos are bad.
[03:34:22.640 --> 03:34:26.160]  I'm saying those tattoos. They have a very evil, just the scum of the earth. And now we've had
[03:34:26.160 --> 03:34:33.920]  Antifa scum at a radical jihadi communist mosque of Kurds discovered that Mr. Robinson
[03:34:33.920 --> 03:34:40.720]  was around the street. They came over and attacked him. He fought back. Just in closing,
[03:34:40.720 --> 03:34:44.960]  what else is coming up? You're very, very busy. You're on the ground. If you're associate,
[03:34:44.960 --> 03:34:48.640]  the camera guy wants to pop back in. He's welcome. But just tell us what's coming next
[03:34:48.640 --> 03:34:54.320]  and any other key points. Well, when I leave here now, I'm going to drive straight to Calais.
[03:34:54.320 --> 03:34:58.400]  I'm going to drive to Calais, sit down with Lauren Southern to hear about her ordeal being
[03:34:58.400 --> 03:35:04.480]  held by customs today in the UK. Do you know one of the things they said to her, Alex? They said to her,
[03:35:04.480 --> 03:35:11.280]  what's your view on, would you intend to run over Muslims with a vehicle? What would you think about
[03:35:11.280 --> 03:35:16.400]  that? Now, could you imagine Muslims coming into the UK and they sat down and asked them these sort
[03:35:16.400 --> 03:35:20.880]  of questions? And that's what they've asked her. They've painted her as a Christian extremist.
[03:35:20.880 --> 03:35:24.720]  They've questioned her a lot about why she's meeting me. And I'll tell you the true reason
[03:35:24.720 --> 03:35:30.240]  for this. Me and Lauren Southern, we're about to partner up and hopefully still will. We're about
[03:35:30.240 --> 03:35:35.520]  to partner up and do some videos together. And I think it worried them. I think the support base
[03:35:35.520 --> 03:35:40.320]  would have worried them. And so they've done every step they've made in the last week, everything
[03:35:40.320 --> 03:35:43.920]  they're doing, even when it comes to statements, they're making in the media, it's all because
[03:35:43.920 --> 03:35:47.840]  they're worried. And they should be worried. They should be worried because right now we're
[03:35:47.840 --> 03:35:51.840]  connecting and speaking to more people than ever before. People are realizing they've been lied
[03:35:51.840 --> 03:35:56.640]  to. The trust in the media is gone. The trust in the police is gone. People are looking elsewhere
[03:35:56.640 --> 03:36:02.160]  now for people that will lead them. I want to lead them. I want to lead people, I want to educate
[03:36:02.160 --> 03:36:06.560]  them, I want to help them, I want to show them exactly what's happening on our streets. And
[03:36:06.560 --> 03:36:11.760]  so long as we can stay alive doing it, what's next is we're going to expose so many problems in
[03:36:11.760 --> 03:36:16.640]  this country. And the thing is, when they make their decisions, when they make their decisions
[03:36:16.640 --> 03:36:22.480]  like they just made to ban Brampton, Brittany Pettibone, and deport them, they do our job.
[03:36:22.480 --> 03:36:27.120]  They red pill so many people. But this Sunday, I'll be in Speaker's Corner giving a speech.
[03:36:27.120 --> 03:36:30.960]  I'll be reading out Martin Selner's speech, the speech that he was due to give. I'll be there
[03:36:30.960 --> 03:36:36.000]  this Sunday, and it will be the battle of Speaker's Corner. The police and the government thought
[03:36:36.000 --> 03:36:40.160]  that they would prevent this by stopping the people coming into our country. Instead,
[03:36:40.160 --> 03:36:44.560]  they've just created a massive swell of support. Thousands of people will be coming to Speaker's
[03:36:44.560 --> 03:36:48.960]  Corner. And hopefully, for the first time, it won't be ruled by Muslims this Sunday.
[03:36:48.960 --> 03:36:53.920]  And by the way, I want to pick up your feed and come here Sunday. What time is that? So I can
[03:36:53.920 --> 03:36:58.160]  line it up so we have live coverage. I'm on four to six already. But that would be basically at
[03:36:58.160 --> 03:37:04.480]  10 at night where you're at. So what time is it? It'll be 3, 3 p.m. Sunday, Speaker's Corner. And
[03:37:04.480 --> 03:37:10.080]  all I want to do is when I met Martin Selner last night, I said, I couldn't care if you were handing
[03:37:10.080 --> 03:37:15.040]  me the Communist Manifesto to read. The point of this is not about Martin Selner. It's not about
[03:37:15.040 --> 03:37:19.920]  Brittany. It's about free speech. It's about the history of our country. It's about 300 years of
[03:37:19.920 --> 03:37:24.720]  history of people being able to go there with controversial ideas and put them out and give
[03:37:24.720 --> 03:37:30.640]  their opinion. This is so big. This is so big. 9 a.m. Sunday. I'm coming in and we're going to
[03:37:30.640 --> 03:37:36.800]  cover this live. So we have multiple feeds, please. I'm going to try to get Paul Watson to go and be
[03:37:36.800 --> 03:37:40.640]  with you there because I'm telling you, just like I got him to go on air, if I can just get him in
[03:37:40.640 --> 03:37:45.440]  the street, it's going to be huge because it's amazing. I know his girlfriend doesn't want him to
[03:37:45.440 --> 03:37:51.200]  get killed, but this is the real fight here. And we've got to expose these people and just hear
[03:37:51.200 --> 03:37:57.920]  the horrible violence. I know the Muslims are radical. Sorry, go ahead. I suspect I have a
[03:37:57.920 --> 03:38:03.600]  feeling this Sunday, for the first time in Britain's history, someone will be prevented from talking.
[03:38:03.600 --> 03:38:10.640]  A British man will be stopped from speaking at Speaker's Corner. My way, Karl Marx from Lenin
[03:38:10.640 --> 03:38:14.960]  to every, all controversial figures have spoke there. But right now, the differences right now
[03:38:14.960 --> 03:38:20.320]  in this era, we have a Muslim population that is not allowed to be offended or upset. So I'll
[03:38:20.320 --> 03:38:25.200]  wait to see the governments, the government's tactic or the police's tactic. I expect to either
[03:38:25.200 --> 03:38:31.760]  be held, grabbed or in a car crash before Sunday. Time will tell. All right. That's Tommy Robinson.
[03:38:31.760 --> 03:38:35.360]  I will call you as soon as the broadcast is over in 20 minutes and I got to get on the road.
[03:38:35.360 --> 03:38:38.880]  You've got so much coming up. Let's just get this planning done because we've been talking a lot
[03:38:38.880 --> 03:38:42.800]  the last six months. You've been like, hey, let's do it. And now you're out of rubble,
[03:38:42.800 --> 03:38:48.880]  your contract, we can do it. So I'm very excited. And we just, we're going to wire you 20,000 today.
[03:38:48.880 --> 03:38:56.080]  We're going to get that done. And people should donate there again at Tommy Robinson dot online
[03:38:56.080 --> 03:39:01.040]  and folks can support us at m4store.com. Now is the time, ladies and gentlemen,
[03:39:01.040 --> 03:39:04.320]  people are taking action. They're not rolling over and hiding in the suburbs and ignoring
[03:39:04.320 --> 03:39:08.320]  what's going on. This is on. This is the fight against the globalist, the fight for free speech.
[03:39:08.320 --> 03:39:12.800]  This is the 21st century tyranny. You know, people face Hitler. They faced Lenin. They
[03:39:12.800 --> 03:39:16.560]  faced Mao. We are facing the globalist and mega corporations that are running this
[03:39:16.560 --> 03:39:20.400]  and we're going to defeat them. We're going to expose them. Tommy Robinson, I salute you and
[03:39:20.400 --> 03:39:27.120]  your team. Oh, please, as soon as we can get Lucy Brown on, she's amazing. Go ahead. I'll get
[03:39:27.120 --> 03:39:31.200]  her to message Nico now. She'll be happy to come on. And do you know why? Do you know what I said?
[03:39:31.200 --> 03:39:36.240]  I looked at her and Lucy's from a completely different background from me. She's a quiet
[03:39:36.240 --> 03:39:43.440]  girl, a lovely girl. She did not hold back. And afterwards I just went, Lucy, come here, darling.
[03:39:43.440 --> 03:39:49.120]  I love you. She absolutely. She's a good looking lady, but how old is she? I mean,
[03:39:49.120 --> 03:39:51.840]  I guess she has the gray hair. I thought she was older, but then she looks young.
[03:39:51.840 --> 03:39:57.520]  She's 27 and she comes after them. There's a little video clip of her going after them
[03:39:57.520 --> 03:40:01.600]  and she pulls one of their masks saying, you think you're a big man? But she, again,
[03:40:01.600 --> 03:40:05.040]  I don't want to, she can go through all this with you herself. She can go through all this
[03:40:05.040 --> 03:40:10.720]  with you herself. But yeah, I absolutely respect her that way.
[03:40:10.720 --> 03:40:13.760]  Let me tell you, it gets me excited seeing a woman kicking a commie's ass when he jumped
[03:40:13.760 --> 03:40:18.000]  on her first, that little piece of crap. Once she grabs his nose and she's like, oh, you didn't know.
[03:40:18.000 --> 03:40:23.680]  She wedged him. She wedged him. She wedged him. I already talked to you soon, my friend, Tommy
[03:40:23.680 --> 03:40:28.400]  Robinson. We salute you. Cheers, Alex. Thanks. Thanks for the support, man. Wow. This is just
[03:40:28.400 --> 03:40:36.080]  epic. Man, I tell you, I was crazy when I first saw this footage for Saturday. Let's go to Owen
[03:40:36.080 --> 03:40:40.960]  Shroyer at the site of the third bombing in a week two in Austin with a fatality. He's off
[03:40:40.960 --> 03:40:45.040]  Montopolis in southeast Austin. Owen, thank you for out there with your live streams reaching
[03:40:45.040 --> 03:40:50.000]  hundreds of thousands. But we've been live. Tell us what you discovered. Well, Alex, when I first
[03:40:50.000 --> 03:40:56.560]  got here, I arrived from the south point. It's actually Riverside and I came up Vargas and I
[03:40:56.560 --> 03:41:00.320]  was coming up on the street that it actually happened at, which is right behind us here.
[03:41:00.960 --> 03:41:07.360]  And the name of it is Gallendino. And this is the second explosion today. Third explosion in
[03:41:07.360 --> 03:41:12.560]  Austin in three weeks. And when I first got here, Alex, we were, we were literally the first media
[03:41:12.560 --> 03:41:18.240]  on the scene and we got exclusive photo footage actually on our live Facebook feed because we
[03:41:18.240 --> 03:41:23.280]  were able to walk around and interview some of the people on the street before the police
[03:41:23.280 --> 03:41:28.720]  investigation came in and shut the road down. But basically you had the explosion happen,
[03:41:29.280 --> 03:41:34.240]  which was only about five miles from here earlier this morning that killed a 17 year old boy and
[03:41:34.240 --> 03:41:39.440]  then significantly wounded the woman that was in the house as well. And then you had this
[03:41:39.440 --> 03:41:46.560]  explosion happen just a few hours after the extent of the injuries of the woman that either opened
[03:41:46.560 --> 03:41:50.960]  the package or found the package. I'm not sure whether she opened it or she just discovered it
[03:41:50.960 --> 03:41:57.040]  and then it detonated. Her injuries, I've not been made aware of, but we do know they were
[03:41:57.040 --> 03:42:00.880]  significant. There was a second woman in the house who we believe was the owner of the house,
[03:42:00.880 --> 03:42:05.680]  an older woman in a wheelchair. She was able to make it out okay. That's what the neighbors reported
[03:42:05.680 --> 03:42:09.760]  to me. They saw her coming out. She got out okay while the other one had to be taken. Well,
[03:42:09.760 --> 03:42:13.280]  that's great news. What about how far they've pushed the cord and back some of the things that
[03:42:13.280 --> 03:42:16.480]  are happening there? I know you're nice to the police, that's fine, but some of them have been
[03:42:16.480 --> 03:42:22.640]  acting a little bit fuggish, I heard. Well, there was, there was an individual and there was a
[03:42:22.640 --> 03:42:28.960]  moment that was a bit strange. And yes, I didn't want to push my luck given the circumstances.
[03:42:28.960 --> 03:42:34.160]  But right now the scene basically you can see here that this entire street, Vargas, at least I know
[03:42:34.160 --> 03:42:40.480]  North of Galindo Street is totally blocked and totally being looked at as up.
[03:42:41.840 --> 03:42:45.680]  You said that they've been searching people's houses, correct? Not just the one that was bombed?
[03:42:46.800 --> 03:42:50.800]  Yes, they did do a sweep of other houses. Stay there. Let's come back and talk about this live
[03:42:50.800 --> 03:42:56.240]  exclusive coverage from the site of what's probably commie bombings. I'm so excited. The new product
[03:42:56.240 --> 03:43:03.040]  at mfullwarslife.com in a glass bottle, two month servings filled to the brim, filled to the absolute
[03:43:03.040 --> 03:43:10.320]  top, the real red pill. This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants
[03:43:10.320 --> 03:43:17.120]  in it, but boy does it stimulate because it's beyond that. Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw
[03:43:17.120 --> 03:43:22.320]  medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging
[03:43:22.320 --> 03:43:27.840]  people a hundred, two hundred dollars for the formulae. And I came up with our own formulae,
[03:43:27.840 --> 03:43:34.320]  working with some scientists and developers. Non-GMO made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[03:43:34.880 --> 03:43:40.560]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones
[03:43:40.560 --> 03:43:45.600]  that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands. It is amazing.
[03:43:46.960 --> 03:43:52.000]  Red pill now available at mfullwarsstore.com and your purchase of the operation.
[03:43:52.000 --> 03:43:59.760]  mfullwarslife.com is extremely excited to announce our latest release,

[03:44:54.720 --> 03:44:56.960]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide. Go ahead.
[03:44:57.600 --> 03:45:02.160]  Oh Alex, you can rent any day of the week. Thank you sir for doing what you do and being a patriot
[03:45:02.160 --> 03:45:08.160]  and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local
[03:45:08.160 --> 03:45:15.760]  areas as well. And as a longtime Infowars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome BrainForce
[03:45:15.760 --> 03:45:20.000]  Anthroplex. My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the Anthroplex too. Thank you.
[03:45:20.000 --> 03:45:24.240]  I use the BioTrue Selenium, the super blue toothpaste for you folks who aren't big normal
[03:45:24.240 --> 03:45:29.520]  toothpaste fans. The super blue is awesome and thank you so much Alex for the Infowars Life
[03:45:29.520 --> 03:45:34.480]  products. They are quality. I can't wait to get some more and thank you so much for doing that
[03:45:34.480 --> 03:45:40.240]  for us to keep us healthy. Absolutely. Because then we could all as educated patriots help our
[03:45:40.240 --> 03:45:45.840]  other countrymen and women understand that there's a bigger problems going on and if we can get our
[03:45:45.840 --> 03:45:49.840]  houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[03:45:54.400 --> 03:45:59.360]  You know someone very profoundly once said many years ago that if fascism ever comes to America
[03:45:59.360 --> 03:46:04.240]  it'll come in the name of liberalism. You're a white male. You're a white man.
[03:46:07.840 --> 03:46:14.880]  Welcome to The War Room, the latest expansion in Infowars live broadcasting. We are live weekdays
[03:46:14.880 --> 03:46:21.360]  from 3 to 6 p.m. central at infowars.com slash show and this YouTube channel right here that
[03:46:21.360 --> 03:46:26.400]  you've landed on. Please subscribe to the channel for updates and notifications. You can follow us
[03:46:26.400 --> 03:46:31.440]  on Twitter at War Room Show. We are going to have the most powerful guests, the most powerful
[03:46:31.440 --> 03:46:37.200]  hosts. We'll be hearing from Alex Jones regularly as well as taking your phone calls.
[03:46:37.200 --> 03:46:42.080]  The liberal establishment media has controlled the narrative for too long. The silent majority
[03:46:42.080 --> 03:47:00.880]  is no longer silent. This is The War Room. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:47:13.040 --> 03:47:20.960]  Strange Days. Found us. From the front lines of the information war. It's Alex Jones. They're going
[03:47:20.960 --> 03:47:46.080]  to destroy us. Crank it up for a minute. They're gone. They're going to destroy us. All right,
[03:47:46.080 --> 03:47:49.360]  I'm going to be hosting The War Room for like 30 minutes until Owen gets back and we got Robb
[03:47:49.360 --> 03:47:55.520]  do out there and Jake Lloyd both of them doing a great job at the site of the third bombing.
[03:47:55.520 --> 03:48:02.400]  By the way, everyone that's been bombed in the last week is black. So it's a white supremacist
[03:48:02.400 --> 03:48:10.160]  mental patient teenager or it's some type of Mexican mafia deal because that all over the
[03:48:10.160 --> 03:48:15.840]  country. Mexican mafia does not like black folks and tries to drive them out. That's a well-known
[03:48:15.840 --> 03:48:20.720]  major friction there or it's some type of weird South by Southwest related deal or it's anti-fuck
[03:48:20.720 --> 03:48:24.720]  because their prime suspects are always saying they're going to attack everybody but not generally
[03:48:24.720 --> 03:48:36.480]  black people. So I have no idea what's going on here. Owen Schreuer, what do you think's going
[03:48:36.480 --> 03:48:43.440]  on? Three bombings. Two of them today. Obviously the first one was a test. You know, your average
[03:48:43.440 --> 03:48:48.080]  high school student though or doesn't know how to make a pipe bomb or bomb that they'll actually
[03:48:48.080 --> 03:48:55.040]  kill somebody. So is this Theodore Kosinski part two? I mean, what are they going to try to frame
[03:48:55.040 --> 03:48:58.960]  right wingers? I mean, we're just speculating right now. The media will say, Jones says he knows
[03:48:58.960 --> 03:49:04.080]  it's anti-fudge. Jones says it's actors are all lies. What do you think? What are the locals told
[03:49:04.080 --> 03:49:09.520]  you? What's your takeaway there on the scene of the third bombing? Well, Alex, obviously more
[03:49:09.520 --> 03:49:16.160]  questions than answers right now considering the nature of the event is what we know somebody just
[03:49:16.160 --> 03:49:21.760]  dropped a package off and then left. As far as reporting any individual from the scene of the
[03:49:21.760 --> 03:49:26.480]  crime, nobody really knows. There were FBI interviews where they talked to neighbors. They said that
[03:49:26.480 --> 03:49:31.360]  they reported a suspicious individual, but that was yesterday, which might actually be important
[03:49:31.360 --> 03:49:37.040]  because the two bombings today both took place within about five miles here in East Texas,
[03:49:37.040 --> 03:49:42.080]  one a little bit more north, this one a little bit more south, but both on the east side of town.
[03:49:42.080 --> 03:49:45.520]  Of course, the fatal one earlier, the fatal one three weeks ago, we're still yet to hear the
[03:49:45.520 --> 03:49:49.600]  injuries of this. As far as what's behind it, I mean, I think that that's kind of what's got
[03:49:49.600 --> 03:49:53.680]  everybody scratching their heads right now. There's some other theories out there about, you know,
[03:49:53.680 --> 03:49:57.440]  perhaps there's people are trying to get a bit of a change into the neighborhood right now. There's
[03:49:57.440 --> 03:50:02.560]  new houses coming up, old ones being torn down. But after talking to the neighbors, the one thing
[03:50:02.560 --> 03:50:06.960]  that I noticed that all the neighbors said is that this is a pretty tight knit community. Everyone
[03:50:06.960 --> 03:50:10.800]  here pretty much knows each other and most of the people that have lived here have lived here for a
[03:50:10.800 --> 03:50:18.080]  long time from when they were kids, even to this point. So it's very strange to them to be thinking
[03:50:18.080 --> 03:50:22.160]  that somebody would be doing this targeting individuals in the neighborhood. All of them
[03:50:22.160 --> 03:50:26.080]  felt like it could have been any of their houses. They don't think that it was actually picked out
[03:50:26.080 --> 03:50:31.760]  by choice to be that woman today or that teenager before. Sure. And they're having a press conference
[03:50:31.760 --> 03:50:35.600]  right behind that we're monitoring. They're telling us, oh, we think the bombings are related. Yeah,
[03:50:35.600 --> 03:50:40.240]  no, you know what, Sherlock. Right. But I do want to kind of hear what's in that real quick. So why
[03:50:40.240 --> 03:50:45.360]  don't you go over? I know you probably can't get your mic up there on the live deal, but let's just
[03:50:45.360 --> 03:50:49.120]  look at the background and some of what's going on and I'll narrate over this. So Owen Troyer is
[03:50:49.120 --> 03:50:55.040]  walking over into the press conference. See if we can hear any of this team from FBI San Antonio
[03:50:55.040 --> 03:51:00.560]  in Austin. They now have their Dallas team coming here to assist us as well. And the ATF is bringing
[03:51:00.560 --> 03:51:06.480]  in their national response team to Austin in addition to help support that's one of the local
[03:51:06.480 --> 03:51:12.480]  feeds. We've got the acting police chief together a task force that will work jointly chief manly
[03:51:12.480 --> 03:51:17.760]  this investigation. And we are that's enough. Let's go back to Owen. Responsible. Yeah,
[03:51:17.760 --> 03:51:21.280]  yeah, let's stay with Jake Lloyd's feed of the press conference, but let's have Owen walk away.
[03:51:21.280 --> 03:51:27.200]  So you know, disrupt it and continue to give us his analysis. Okay, Alex. So so like I said,
[03:51:27.200 --> 03:51:31.920]  this was an incident that that all of the neighbors and everybody here don't think was
[03:51:32.880 --> 03:51:37.760]  purposely targeting that individual. They don't feel that the lady whose house it was. It was
[03:51:37.760 --> 03:51:41.600]  actually that I believe it was her daughter that was in the house that suffered the injuries. The
[03:51:41.600 --> 03:51:45.600]  old lady who who's lived there, who's lived there for a long time. Again, neighbors who've lived on
[03:51:45.600 --> 03:51:48.960]  the street are like, yeah, I've known her my whole life. And they don't believe that she would have
[03:51:48.960 --> 03:51:53.360]  been targeted by anyone. She was able to get out in her wheelchair without sustaining too many
[03:51:53.360 --> 03:51:59.120]  injuries, but her daughter had to be taken out. You know, Alex, I think that, you know, most of
[03:51:59.120 --> 03:52:03.360]  the people here, they talk about how, you know, there's a lot of there's a lot of crime in this
[03:52:03.360 --> 03:52:07.680]  area. Sometimes there's drug raids that cause a lot of attention. You might even get a gunshot
[03:52:07.680 --> 03:52:12.640]  every once while a stabbing. So something that would cause a crime scene event. But they think
[03:52:12.640 --> 03:52:17.680]  that perhaps this area was targeted because of that reason that a individual could come into this
[03:52:17.680 --> 03:52:22.720]  area, be suspicious, walk around in a hood and kind of get away with it because activity like
[03:52:22.720 --> 03:52:27.440]  that maybe happens here more often than not. Sure, they targeted a hot crime area thinking it
[03:52:27.440 --> 03:52:32.720]  would get it would have too many leads for the police to find who did it. Right. So the only,
[03:52:32.720 --> 03:52:36.800]  I mean, the only leads, again, I was speaking to a lot of the same neighbors that the FBI and
[03:52:36.800 --> 03:52:42.000]  police were investigating. And again, info wars was actually the first crew on scene here, Alex.
[03:52:42.000 --> 03:52:47.120]  We were here before. Okay, we just lost his feet. We're going to try to get that back up. Owen
[03:52:47.120 --> 03:52:56.080]  Troyer doing a great job. I had no exaggeration. Over 100 articles I wanted to get in today and
[03:52:56.080 --> 03:52:59.920]  a bunch of clips the crew did a great job getting and I just went down the rabbit hole with the
[03:52:59.920 --> 03:53:04.320]  attack on free speech Tommy Robinson the bombing here in Austin, so many other articles on news
[03:53:04.320 --> 03:53:08.800]  wars.com. I didn't get to I'm going to play some of these clips for Ellen gets back once the
[03:53:08.800 --> 03:53:16.800]  war room kicks off. So I guess those live feeds probably be, you know, info wars live cut or
[03:53:16.800 --> 03:53:24.560]  like info wars on the scene of bombings in Austin and then we can get Owen back in here to cover it,
[03:53:24.560 --> 03:53:28.080]  but I've got a bunch of clips I want to get to one of these is on news wars.com
[03:53:29.120 --> 03:53:33.680]  barrage rips EU over targeting a Poland, Hungary and blistering parliament speech. Yeah,
[03:53:33.680 --> 03:53:37.040]  they're threatening to basically invade them if they don't let Muslims come in unvetted
[03:53:37.040 --> 03:53:42.160]  and Soros Braggs. He's running this. I mean, it's just the criminality is unbelievable. Very
[03:53:42.160 --> 03:53:45.840]  powerful speech. I'm going to play some of that next hour on the war room when that kicks off.
[03:53:45.840 --> 03:53:49.360]  David nice. We're doing a great job as well. It was great having him host the Sunday show
[03:53:49.360 --> 03:53:56.480]  yesterday. I watched that last night when I after I got home and we've got I should have
[03:53:56.480 --> 03:54:01.520]  led the whole show with this. I mentioned it some but Assange warned CIA flooding the Democratic
[03:54:01.520 --> 03:54:10.400]  Party. They're running over 15 national candidates who are CIA leftist. None of them are covert
[03:54:10.400 --> 03:54:14.240]  action people or you know, they're all pencil pushing globalist hate this country. That's
[03:54:14.240 --> 03:54:18.640]  what they are as a cancer to destroy the country. And it's all the websites are all built by the
[03:54:18.640 --> 03:54:24.320]  same people. This is illegal. And I mean, they're intending to overthrow the country and they're
[03:54:24.320 --> 03:54:29.040]  intending to steal the election. So and Assange has the documents that's up on in full wars.com.
[03:54:29.040 --> 03:54:32.400]  That went viral this weekend, but it didn't get the attention after that. It needs to go viral.
[03:54:32.400 --> 03:54:36.800]  I'm going to be covering that one way or the other. But this is really huge article. Assange
[03:54:36.800 --> 03:54:43.200]  warns CIA flooding into Democratic Party for 2018 midterms. Assange is also a classical liberal
[03:54:43.200 --> 03:54:48.080]  attack to be the UK government. We're only spending things like 18 million pounds on human
[03:54:48.080 --> 03:54:51.600]  rights stuff and admitting that they're running working with radical Islam for sex slavery. You
[03:54:51.600 --> 03:54:58.640]  name it. Assange is just an awesome patriot. I can tell you that right now. So far from a Russian
[03:54:58.640 --> 03:55:03.680]  agent, just absolutely asinine. Now briefly before we end the Alex Jones transmission and then go
[03:55:03.680 --> 03:55:09.280]  into the war room is going to kick off two minutes after that live at info wars.com forward slash
[03:55:09.280 --> 03:55:16.080]  show or on stations around the country. We need your support. I don't have $20,000 in our budget
[03:55:16.080 --> 03:55:23.440]  to send a money to Tommy Robinson, but it has to happen because the work he's doing is too critical
[03:55:23.440 --> 03:55:27.440]  to everybody. I didn't have $20,000 to send a project Veritas, but they got us footage that's
[03:55:27.440 --> 03:55:31.280]  going to help us win our lawsuits for free speech. And if we don't do this, everybody falls. I don't
[03:55:31.280 --> 03:55:35.200]  want to have to do the stuff we're about to have to do. I need major capital. So if you've never

[03:55:59.440 --> 03:56:05.440]  money, but not actual money we make to run things because I, you know, sometimes I just, they do
[03:56:05.440 --> 03:56:09.120]  whatever I say around here and I tell the crew challenge me sometimes because sometimes I'm,
[03:56:09.120 --> 03:56:12.800]  you know, not thinking too straight, like not covering the bombing the first hour and a half

[03:56:55.760 --> 03:57:00.720]  base. Well, Alex, all types of news, obviously we'll be covering the CIA trying to infiltrate
[03:57:00.720 --> 03:57:05.280]  the Democrat party to remove President Trump from office. We've also got former attorney general of
[03:57:05.280 --> 03:57:11.600]  California, Kamala Harris, accused a man of a hate crime that he never did. Even CNN is blowing
[03:57:11.600 --> 03:57:15.440]  that one out of the water. So Kamala Harris is being exposed as a total fraud. I don't think
[03:57:15.440 --> 03:57:18.880]  she's going to be able to run for president. Oh, I mean, 99% of these complaints that liberal
[03:57:18.880 --> 03:57:24.640]  files fake. This stuff filed on us is complete horse pucky. And I, quite frankly, the gloves are
[03:57:24.640 --> 03:57:29.200]  off, man. They picked the wrong one to go with that because it's pure BS. And so everybody,
[03:57:29.200 --> 03:57:33.440]  get ready. Hope you enjoy all of us defending our rights. I would show you're coming up.
[03:57:33.440 --> 03:57:36.800]  I'm going to be hosting the war room though till he gets here and Roger Stone and more.
[03:57:36.800 --> 03:57:50.320]  Right. He'll tell us about Russia game. Stay with us.
