[00:00.000 --> 00:14.420]  They put out a report in February saying we're gonna use COVID-19 to lock down the economy bringing global digital tracking apps on
[00:14.420 --> 00:39.700]  everybody's phones, shut down all small businesses, and start the third world to death-lower carbon emissions. They call it the Great Reset.
[00:39.700 --> 00:47.280]  We were saying in February this looks like the big reset that Davos has been calling for to shut down the world economy and consolidate power for them.
[00:47.280 --> 01:01.580]  Criminals love to brag and they love to lay out their battle plans and why would we sit here and not take them for their word for it when they've carried out every damn thing they've set out to carry out.
[01:01.580 --> 01:13.820]  Now a lot of times they're behind schedule, a lot of times what they do falls apart, but you know what, they are trying to execute their plan, as you can see, and they are doing a lot of acceleration of it right now because they're behind.
[01:13.820 --> 01:39.220]  We need nothing short of a paradigm shift, one that inspires action at revolutionary levels and pace. We simply cannot waste any more time. The only limit is our willingness to act.
[01:39.220 --> 01:54.220]  And the time to act is now. They just hope that the public doesn't catch on to this and that they can continue to move forward, but they know the public is catching on to them and so is Congress and so are different sections of different corporate areas around the world.
[01:54.220 --> 02:14.220]  But when it comes to exposing their plan to confuse and derail the election, she uses money and and he's one of many people. He's not the only one who works for her. He was talking to his opponents and other people saying that, you know, here we are, you know, he was just boosting, you know,
[02:14.220 --> 02:29.220]  he said I have 300 and he had them in his hand. Got it right here. Like a cash. Like cash. Question. Have you ever asked yourself how did he get them? Yeah, how did he get them? You just don't go and like I was looking at them and they were not filled or blank.
[02:29.220 --> 02:33.220]  Right. They were some were open. Yeah.
[02:33.220 --> 02:49.220]  Who is the one filling out the absentee ballots? People will work with like an animal bar and other candidates work for them.
[02:49.220 --> 02:58.220]  The 80 million of them get sent to dead dogs and dead cats and dead people and how they're finding them in ditches and finding them in waste paper baskets and finding them in dumpsters.
[02:58.220 --> 03:08.220]  At the U. S. Postal Service just dropped the ball here. Tino Pena says somewhere between here and Texas are the Palm Beach County ballots of her father and son.
[03:08.220 --> 03:15.220]  Ballots that she sent to them as they visit family this month and were sent back to her last week.
[03:15.220 --> 03:24.220]  Tracking info says the envelope did get here to the postal distribution facility in West Palm, but it never got to Royal Palm Beach for delivery.
[03:24.220 --> 03:34.220]  It couldn't really explain what happened. The delivery supervisor looked everything up. She saw the label was properly made out to return back here to my address.
[03:34.220 --> 03:40.220]  But for some reason in the system is scanned a Texas Houston address.
[03:40.220 --> 03:54.220]  5,842 absentee ballots cast in Dallas County were counted, but not included in the total number of votes. The Secretary of State's office discovered the issue.
[03:54.220 --> 04:03.220]  The U. S. Attorney issued a statement saying nine million ballots for military members were found discarded. Seven were cast for President Trump.
[04:03.220 --> 04:08.220]  Two had been resealed. It's not known which candidate those ballots favored.
[04:08.220 --> 04:18.220]  And so President Trump has to level with the American people about the Democrat plan for what I call 79 days of hell.
[04:18.220 --> 04:30.220]  79 days in another brazen attempt, just like the Russia hoax, to claim that the election of Donald John Trump, the 45th President of the United States, the first time and the second time is illegitimate.
[04:30.220 --> 04:38.220]  They know they're losing. Mr. President, you have the Podesta war game that even the New York Times reported on that they can't deny.
[04:38.220 --> 04:43.220]  Where they say we're going to contest it because we know we're going to lose.
[04:43.220 --> 04:52.220]  And then we try to hold it up to inauguration day and hope the military takes out Trump. Those are quotes.
[04:52.220 --> 04:58.220]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's September 29th. It's game time. The national debate, the first presidential debate. Stay with us.
[04:58.220 --> 05:15.220]  And perhaps, most cruelly of all, if Donald Trump has his way, the complications from COVID-19, which are well beyond what they should be, it's estimated that 200 million people have died.
[05:15.220 --> 05:18.220]  Probably by the time I finish this talk.
[05:18.220 --> 05:34.220]  Joe Biden has always been a congenital liar. Part of the establishment for close to 50 years. But now, boy, as his brain degenerates, we are seeing walking public dementia on the biggest stage in the world, the 2020 election.
[05:34.220 --> 05:53.220]  There are 370 million people in the United States. If 200 million died from COVID, that'd be more than half of the population, when not even one tenth of 1% have actually died. But him putting these giant lies and these incredibly brain damaged statements out is emblematic of the general public being in a trance.
[05:53.220 --> 06:08.220]  How is anyone even putting up with this? It is beyond bizarre.
[06:08.220 --> 06:27.220]  Ladies and gentlemen, across the United States and the world, it's the day we've all been waiting for. Tuesday, September 29th, 2020, 34 days out from the election, 113 days out from the inauguration.
[06:27.220 --> 06:39.220]  As we cruise towards the globalist contesting of the election, the plunge the country into civil war and martial law. In their own words, they hope to trigger a military coup.
[06:39.220 --> 07:00.220]  But the people of America and the world understand how high the stakes are of the U.S. falls to tyranny and we are overcoming the AI censorship, the leftist bullies in the streets, the bullies in the universities and the job place and the churches, the mountains, the hills, the valleys, the lakes, the oceans.
[07:00.220 --> 07:11.220]  And the awakening is massive and humanity is coming together more than humanity is being divided. That's why the deep states trying to divide us, but they are failing.
[07:11.220 --> 07:22.220]  We're going to be live. We've been live since 8am this morning with David Knight doing a great job with his weekday morning transmission, the David Knight show that I come on. I'm your host, Alex Jones, 11am central to 3pm.
[07:22.220 --> 07:31.220]  Then the war room for three hours, Owen Shroyer, and then of course we have election countdown seven to nine. Well, it all combines together today.
[07:31.220 --> 07:49.220]  The last hour of Owen's show today will be countdown to the debate, but from six to probably midnight, we're going to be live here for several hours before covering what's coming up with the debate, looking at all the issues, taking your calls.
[07:49.220 --> 08:00.220]  And then at 8pm central, that's 9pm Eastern, it kicks off for an hour and a half. And we have our reporters also on the ground in Cleveland, Ohio.
[08:00.220 --> 08:10.220]  They'll be joining us later in this three hours, but they'll also be joining us live in the aftermath of the debate and also before the debate from the ground in Cleveland, Ohio.
[08:10.220 --> 08:17.220]  So look forward to that coming up today.
[08:17.220 --> 08:36.220]  And again, I'll say this, we have on this syndicated radio show that I've been doing for 24 years in this slot, 24 years in this slot, 11am to 3pm.
[08:36.220 --> 08:42.220]  Over a million people conservatively tuning in one way or another every hour. That's a very conservative number.
[08:42.220 --> 08:51.220]  Some days we've had 20 million tuned into a show. Usually it's about 4 million. And then later more tuned in to watch video clips and things. And sometimes it's huge. Sometimes it's not.
[08:51.220 --> 09:01.220]  Sometimes we might get a couple hundred thousand people that watch the archives. Sometimes it might be 5 million. It's truly what is most important, who the guest are, what unfolds.
[09:01.220 --> 09:16.220]  But when you get excited and you take the live links from man.video and 2020electioncenter.com and infowars.conforts.show of the live feed of the debate that is the same feed that's going out now.
[09:16.220 --> 09:20.220]  And when you share that and others share it, it causes a chain reaction.
[09:20.220 --> 09:40.220]  And we had on the video streams alone IP addresses that came through 86 million plus thousands of 86.4 million different IP addresses that were real IP addresses, not hack attacks.
[09:40.220 --> 09:59.220]  We have devices and things that can tell what that is for cyber security. We block those 86 million people clicked on the infowars video feeds and audio feeds in the week of the election four years ago.
[09:59.220 --> 10:04.220]  Number one political show in the world.
[10:04.220 --> 10:17.220]  And that's when Hillary in the new world order in the deep state went completely aid because if they wouldn't have followed the lawsuits and engaged all the censorship and all the things, we would have continued to absolutely clean their clocks.
[10:17.220 --> 10:25.220]  But the good news is when we get a chance when you get a chance to be heard and to speak up and to stand up and take action, you win.
[10:25.220 --> 10:37.220]  Because infowars is not Alex Jones. Sure, I might be part of the body that's info wars, but it's all the listeners. It's all the viewers. It's the radio stations. It's the sponsors.
[10:37.220 --> 10:48.220]  It's the guest. It's the crew. It's all of us is one battering ram of truth taken on the globalist. And that's why when you call in and thank me on air, you're really thinking yourself for taking action.
[10:48.220 --> 11:02.220]  And that's why I appreciate support, but thinking me for trying to survive, thinking me for trying to come up for air against the satanic force, fighting me for just wanting to have justice and be with you in the future.
[11:02.220 --> 11:13.220]  Well, I better be damn well be doing this. It's not a heroic act to take on the satanist. It is default survival.
[11:13.220 --> 11:26.220]  Somebody tries to rob you. Somebody tries to mug you. They're going to rob the next person. They might kill the next person. You got a responsibility to take that gun away from him and to kill him.
[11:26.220 --> 11:33.220]  Not because you want to hurt somebody, but once you get him on the ground, go ahead and kick him in the throat.
[11:33.220 --> 11:46.220]  Get that problem out of the way and stop letting evil grow and grow and grow and grow and grow. Go ahead and thump them a few extra times right in the temple and send them home to mommy.
[11:46.220 --> 11:56.220]  Because it's been our city here putting up with all this tyranny so long and rolling over to it that has gotten us in this position.
[11:56.220 --> 12:05.220]  It's time to take out the trash. We're doing it peacefully. We're doing it with information warfare and with the truth, but sure as hell.
[12:05.220 --> 12:14.220]  If the enemy's able to steal this election, kill Trump, set off a nuke, God knows what. They're behind it and they pay and match critical.
[12:14.220 --> 12:26.220]  Lion down has gotten us where we are. Everything successful cultures have had and America has had was fought for every inch of it.
[12:26.220 --> 12:31.220]  And we've been living off what other people did for a long time.
[12:31.220 --> 12:35.220]  And now that reality is coming home to roost. Let me tell you what we got today.
[12:35.220 --> 12:47.220]  Just as a clock starts at midnight and goes through back to noon and then back to midnight again. We knew that it was a chai calm Psyop eight months ago.
[12:47.220 --> 12:54.220]  The question is, is it a deadly virus or is it not deadly or is it overblown? But the whole Psyop, we were right about that.
[12:54.220 --> 13:02.220]  For the digital currency, for the worldwide control, for the banning of cash, for UN world government, for the tracking apps.
[13:02.220 --> 13:06.220]  For the martial law, for the pretext to arrest people and disappear them.
[13:06.220 --> 13:15.220]  For the pretext of forced inoculations and boom, Australia has announced it in the same day the UK announced it in parliament.
[13:15.220 --> 13:26.220]  Forced inoculations to get on an airplane, to have a job, to go to a pub, to have dinner, to go to the grocery store for your children to go to school.
[13:26.220 --> 13:35.220]  And they're telling you, it's whatever the UN recommends, but whatever Bill Gates says.
[13:35.220 --> 13:44.220]  You got people literally escaping with bedsheets out of high windows of COVID-19 lockdown centers in New Zealand.
[13:44.220 --> 13:49.220]  And here's some of the headlines, the new normal, infowars.com, videos coming up.
[13:49.220 --> 13:53.220]  Remember parliament urges mandatory coronavirus vaccination to be allowed to travel.
[13:53.220 --> 13:58.220]  And of course an ID proving it, which will be used for the total tracking control.
[13:58.220 --> 14:02.220]  Meanwhile, they're hyping, oh, the new wave is here.
[14:02.220 --> 14:08.220]  Because they've massively all signed into law, Trump did it as well, so did Boris Johnson, so did the EU.
[14:08.220 --> 14:15.220]  Tripling of the already 12, 13, 14, 15, some cases, 20 times the testing they were doing previously.
[14:15.220 --> 14:20.220]  Well, now they're going to massively increase that, and then their faulty test, so everybody's got corona.
[14:20.220 --> 14:28.220]  They're not dying, the death rate's super low, but just showing positive is enough to disappear you forever.
[14:28.220 --> 14:31.220]  Oh, Europe got it wrong, they didn't lock down long enough.
[14:31.220 --> 14:34.220]  It's back, all a hoax.
[14:34.220 --> 14:41.220]  Monkey see monkey do to make Trump look bad, so we keep the economy locked down, so communist China wins.
[14:41.220 --> 14:47.220]  And now the documents have come out that indeed communist China is bragging about all of that,
[14:47.220 --> 14:55.220]  and knows exactly what they've done was to shut down the United States economy.
[14:55.220 --> 15:01.220]  So the Chinese economy, and the Microsofts, and the Amazons, and the Googles,
[15:01.220 --> 15:07.220]  and those that are allied with the Chinese slave goods, the Walmart, only they can stay open.
[15:07.220 --> 15:13.220]  They're essential, you're non-essential, and then as your jobs go away, now you're going to be on welfare too.
[15:13.220 --> 15:21.220]  And now the system can dictate to you to do whatever they want, whenever they want, however they want.
[15:21.220 --> 15:26.220]  And now Tucker Carlson's put out a report showing all the Democrats caught in bus stations and train stations,
[15:26.220 --> 15:32.220]  and air stations not wearing masks because they're the royalty.
[15:32.220 --> 15:34.220]  They don't have to, they're God.
[15:34.220 --> 15:39.220]  You think Diane Feinstein, almost 90 years old, a prime candidate for COVID, you think she's scared?
[15:39.220 --> 15:43.220]  No, she doesn't wear one, she doesn't wear one on an airplane, because she knows it's a fraud.
[15:43.220 --> 15:46.220]  She's a known Chinese agent on record.
[15:46.220 --> 15:50.220]  She's winning, you're losing, because you bought it into the fear.
[15:50.220 --> 15:52.220]  Ha-ha!
[15:52.220 --> 16:18.220]  I'm Alex Jones, live coverage of the debate starts now.
[16:22.220 --> 16:28.220]  And traffic control every aspect of our lives, literally brainwashing us with the stimuli that they put forward,
[16:28.220 --> 16:37.220]  because they do not want us to take our birthright, not just of Americana, but of true Christmastom and the Renaissance and the Enlightenment.
[16:37.220 --> 16:42.220]  They are trying to create the new Dark Age, where they have all the high technology and life extension,
[16:42.220 --> 16:49.220]  and we are walled off in a technocracy that controls us through carbon credits and through a social credit score.
[16:49.220 --> 16:56.220]  This is their plan. We must come together and awaken out of our trance and say no, we must embrace God.
[16:56.220 --> 17:02.220]  You notice that over and over again, the United Nations, our supposed controllers and bosses,
[17:02.220 --> 17:06.220]  the great arbiter of truth that no one's allowed to disagree with, has come out and said,
[17:06.220 --> 17:10.220]  nothing can treat or prevent COVID-19.
[17:10.220 --> 17:12.220]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's a total lie.
[17:12.220 --> 17:19.220]  If you get a lot of sunlight, it's on record, to produce a ton of vitamin D3, and it's almost impossible to get viral infections
[17:19.220 --> 17:21.220]  when you're getting plenty of vitamin D3.
[17:21.220 --> 17:26.220]  If you have zinc and vitamin C as well, that's why people get the flus and these colds in the winter,
[17:26.220 --> 17:28.220]  because that's when vitamin D levels plunge.
[17:28.220 --> 17:36.220]  Now, I've pointed this out, and the media has called me a scammer for saying that there's hope that people should have their vitamins and their minerals.
[17:36.220 --> 17:42.220]  Well, now Fauci's been forced to come out and admit that you need vitamin D3 and see he should have also added zinc,
[17:42.220 --> 17:46.220]  because the NIH website says you die without zinc.
[17:46.220 --> 17:49.220]  But it's good news that he's being pressured now to admit the reality,
[17:49.220 --> 18:07.220]  because so many doctors and nurses and experts in nutrition have been exposing the fact that he's not been warning the public to get their vitamins.
[18:19.220 --> 18:32.220]  The bad news is that globalists are well organized, highly financed, and completely ruthless,
[18:32.220 --> 18:37.220]  and have already completed more than 70% of their operation.
[18:37.220 --> 18:42.220]  The good news is every tyranny formed against humanity has always failed,
[18:42.220 --> 18:49.220]  because humanity always wakes up two minutes to midnight and rallies and overthrows the tyrants.
[18:49.220 --> 18:53.220]  And we're beginning to see that same paradigm unfold right now.
[18:53.220 --> 19:00.220]  So when I come to you with absolutely devastatingly scary news, it's because I think you're a leader,
[19:00.220 --> 19:05.220]  and I think you understand this is only going to get worse if we go along with it.
[19:05.220 --> 19:12.220]  And I understand that you deserve the truth, and you deserve to know the big picture.
[19:12.220 --> 19:14.220]  So let's lay it out right now.
[19:14.220 --> 19:25.220]  The average person projects their own goodness, their own decency onto the public.
[19:25.220 --> 19:38.220]  They project that and just can't believe that there's evil intent, because they're always told with successive approximation or incrementalism that,
[19:38.220 --> 19:46.220]  oh, this is being done for this reason, even though you can go show them documents and white papers and reports that's really towards a larger goal,
[19:46.220 --> 19:50.220]  and the establishment admits how they're doing it incrementally and how it's authoritarian,
[19:50.220 --> 19:54.220]  and how it's going to consolidate and how it's meant to depopulate.
[19:54.220 --> 20:00.220]  The average person only looks at the surface because they want to believe everything's okay.
[20:00.220 --> 20:07.220]  They don't want to believe there's nefarious things going on because they've been trained to be selfish themselves
[20:07.220 --> 20:14.220]  and believe that if they get informed or involved, that takes away from their own personal fun.
[20:14.220 --> 20:16.220]  That's one group of people that don't get involved.
[20:16.220 --> 20:22.220]  Others are just so naive because they're good people, they just can't believe what's happening, and others are too simple.
[20:22.220 --> 20:30.220]  Let's call them stupid, childlike, to say no to anything.
[20:30.220 --> 20:38.220]  And then others are very shy and a lot of times intelligent, but don't see themselves as being leaders.
[20:38.220 --> 20:44.220]  They almost see it as arrogant to put themselves out there, and they don't want to be troublemakers.
[20:44.220 --> 20:50.220]  And then there are, of course, those that are very, very wicked and crave power and control and love the fact that the public bowels to them
[20:50.220 --> 20:55.220]  and that they take acquiescence as an excuse to only dominate and control more.
[20:55.220 --> 21:00.220]  But you've got others that are intelligent but still just like to follow orders.
[21:00.220 --> 21:03.220]  You've got others that aren't intelligent and follow orders.
[21:03.220 --> 21:10.220]  Then you've got people that dream of human potential and want to see humanity empowered and who have deep empathy for our species
[21:10.220 --> 21:19.220]  and also a connection to God and a great vision of what we can do if we are truly unleashed together.
[21:19.220 --> 21:32.220]  And I know that's who you are, not as an audience, but as a group of activists that have come together, and that's why I salute you and thank you.
[21:32.220 --> 21:36.220]  That said, let's go ahead and get into this right now.
[21:36.220 --> 21:45.220]  In the next segment, I've got great examples of solutions against this.
[21:45.220 --> 21:48.220]  This is the COVID, part of the COVID stack today.
[21:48.220 --> 21:49.220]  New normal.
[21:49.220 --> 21:53.220]  A Member of Parliament urges mandatory coronavirus vaccine to be allowed to travel.
[21:53.220 --> 21:55.220]  That's already been proposed by Bill Gates and the UN.
[21:55.220 --> 21:58.220]  Now they're just getting to the rollout point.
[21:58.220 --> 22:03.220]  Coronavirus second wave, which countries in Europe are experiencing a fresh spike in COVID-19 cases.
[22:03.220 --> 22:11.220]  Not deaths, but more testing, 90% false positive on average.
[22:11.220 --> 22:13.220]  That's the new normal.
[22:13.220 --> 22:21.220]  So it's just having it that makes you be disappeared, it's the having it why you've got to be locked down, why your job's gone, why you've got to go into death.
[22:21.220 --> 22:23.220]  Europe's second wave was here.
[22:23.220 --> 22:27.220]  France and the UK recorded their highest daily COVID-19 cases over the EU,
[22:27.220 --> 22:32.220]  warned that some countries have worse outbreaks in March than in March.
[22:32.220 --> 22:35.220]  Oh, and we've got to all be locked down.
[22:35.220 --> 22:37.220]  How it all went wrong again in Europe.
[22:37.220 --> 22:41.220]  A second wave grips the continent, grips it, see it in.
[22:41.220 --> 22:46.220]  What's gripping it is suicide and collapse and murder and death, but it doesn't matter.
[22:46.220 --> 22:47.220]  It's all just hype.
[22:47.220 --> 22:48.220]  People love hype.
[22:48.220 --> 22:50.220]  Peter Carlson put out a big report.
[22:50.220 --> 22:51.220]  We'll air later.
[22:51.220 --> 22:56.220]  Photos of top Democrats ignoring mass policy.
[22:56.220 --> 23:00.220]  Not just Feinstein, but many, many others.
[23:00.220 --> 23:02.220]  Meanwhile, people thought this was a joke.
[23:02.220 --> 23:03.220]  It's not a joke.
[23:03.220 --> 23:09.220]  London pub demands no extended eye contact as part of the new Corona rules.
[23:09.220 --> 23:11.220]  You ask, well, where does that come from?
[23:11.220 --> 23:15.220]  Well, that actually comes from the U.N. and the British Ministry.
[23:15.220 --> 23:16.220]  We go to this article.
[23:16.220 --> 23:22.220]  They now say, look away from someone when you walk down the street.
[23:22.220 --> 23:25.220]  Look away when passing other people.
[23:25.220 --> 23:27.220]  It's the cult.
[23:27.220 --> 23:28.220]  Stand on one leg.
[23:28.220 --> 23:30.220]  Stick your thumb up your ear in.
[23:30.220 --> 23:32.220]  Drink the Kool-Aid.
[23:32.220 --> 23:39.220]  Meanwhile, Madrid explodes as police violently crackdown on anti-lockdown protesters with
[23:39.220 --> 23:41.220]  their new martial law curfew.
[23:41.220 --> 23:46.220]  Boston shuts down Salt Bay luxury steakhouse because they didn't keep people six feet away
[23:46.220 --> 23:47.220]  at the bar.
[23:47.220 --> 23:48.220]  It's just ridiculous.
[23:48.220 --> 23:54.220]  The Black Lives Matter and the communists, they're all great.
[23:54.220 --> 23:59.220]  And Trump spent 750 million to increase testing ushering in lockdown too.
[23:59.220 --> 24:03.220]  We all use that to boost the numbers and say everybody's got to be locked down.
[24:03.220 --> 24:07.220]  That's just Trump not knowing what the left hand's doing.
[24:07.220 --> 24:09.220]  So that's just some of what's coming up.
[24:09.220 --> 24:11.220]  But let's just go ahead and play one of the videos.
[24:11.220 --> 24:19.220]  Here he is, member of parliament, Tobias L. Wood saying he wants the dangerous, unproven
[24:19.220 --> 24:25.220]  vaccine that they admit 100% of people get sick with the new mRNA vaccine that Gates
[24:25.220 --> 24:26.220]  has.
[24:26.220 --> 24:33.220]  Gates has given people the major diseases around the world like cancer and polio.
[24:33.220 --> 24:34.220]  But that's okay.
[24:34.220 --> 24:38.220]  You need to have this in a passport, a digital ID to travel.
[24:38.220 --> 24:41.220]  So here we are, past 1984.
[24:41.220 --> 24:42.220]  Boom, it's here.
[24:42.220 --> 24:45.220]  And universities are already announcing it here in the U.S.
[24:45.220 --> 24:50.220]  Whatever globalist reservation they've got is used as an incubation center, which they
[24:50.220 --> 24:54.220]  then take control of and then exploit to launch the attack to take over the surrounding areas.
[24:54.220 --> 24:57.220]  This is an ideological takeover.
[24:57.220 --> 25:03.220]  Using hypochondria, hysteria, mental illness, fear, and big tech is behind it all with the
[25:03.220 --> 25:04.220]  chai cops.
[25:04.220 --> 25:11.220]  So here is the member of parliament pushing the mark of the beast implantable system.
[25:11.220 --> 25:16.220]  I'd like to focus on the rollouts of a vaccine, which may seem a little premature given we
[25:16.220 --> 25:19.220]  are contemplating a second wave of the pandemic and indeed further economic intervention.
[25:19.220 --> 25:22.220]  But a vaccine is potentially six months away.
[25:22.220 --> 25:23.220]  China is already mass producing A products.
[25:23.220 --> 25:25.220]  It's got another 10 others online as well.
[25:25.220 --> 25:28.220]  Oxford is heading into its phase three tests with tens of thousands of people being tested
[25:28.220 --> 25:30.220]  as are other institutions around the globe.
[25:30.220 --> 25:34.220]  But the scale and complexity of this challenge is up there with the D-day landings and indeed
[25:34.220 --> 25:35.220]  Dunkirk.
[25:35.220 --> 25:38.220]  And to put it politely, Madam Deputy Speaker, we must learn the lessons of the PPE rollout
[25:38.220 --> 25:39.220]  testing track and trace.
[25:39.220 --> 25:43.220]  Mass vaccine rollout is an enormous responsibility and we need to get it right.
[25:43.220 --> 25:45.220]  Planning must start immediately.
[25:45.220 --> 25:49.220]  And I have written to the Prime Minister recommending that he consider calling on the Ministry of
[25:49.220 --> 25:53.220]  Health to establish a small task force led by a senior and powered voice of authority to
[25:53.220 --> 25:55.220]  begin the planning and design of a draft blueprint.
[25:55.220 --> 25:59.220]  The armed forces have the capacity, the logistical experience and the national reach and are
[25:59.220 --> 26:03.220]  not overburdened by any current duties involving tackling COVID-19 to take on this mammoth and
[26:03.220 --> 26:04.220]  incredible task.
[26:04.220 --> 26:08.220]  And when you pause to consider what is involved, the logistics of shifting millions of refrigerated
[26:08.220 --> 26:10.220]  vaccines across the country, the creation of regional distribution.
[26:10.220 --> 26:14.220]  I don't know how this got on air and I'm not mad at the crew, but this is just part,
[26:14.220 --> 26:16.220]  you know, this is whatever, this is wonderful.
[26:16.220 --> 26:20.220]  They downloaded it and it was sped up.
[26:20.220 --> 26:24.220]  We now in the folder have the one that's not sped up, so we're going to suspend the transmission
[26:24.220 --> 26:29.220]  now and we'll go to break and we'll come back and play it not sped up.
[26:29.220 --> 26:33.220]  But listening to that, we need the military to forcibly inoculate here.
[26:33.220 --> 26:35.220]  You can't leave your house.
[26:35.220 --> 26:38.220]  So boom, that's where this is.
[26:38.220 --> 26:39.220]  It's all you and directed.
[26:39.220 --> 26:40.220]  We're coming.
[26:40.220 --> 26:41.220]  We're going to take you.
[26:41.220 --> 26:42.220]  And this is all for a virus.
[26:42.220 --> 26:47.220]  They own the synthetic, very hard to kill people unless you're overrun or run down.
[26:47.220 --> 26:51.220]  But now they're coming out with even more deadly viruses as Bill Gates promised.
[26:51.220 --> 26:52.220]  That's the big enchilada.
[26:52.220 --> 26:55.220]  Stay with us.
[26:55.220 --> 26:59.220]  The globalists are very, very honest about their planetary goals.
[26:59.220 --> 27:06.220]  They want private corporate governance above nation states, above religious institutions,
[27:06.220 --> 27:08.220]  above the family.
[27:08.220 --> 27:10.220]  They want total corporate power.
[27:10.220 --> 27:16.220]  There was a great film back in the early 1970s called Roller Ball with James Cahn.
[27:16.220 --> 27:20.220]  And it's based on a novel set in the year 2020.
[27:20.220 --> 27:24.220]  And in the book, you have megacorporates that control the planet.
[27:24.220 --> 27:27.220]  And there are no longer nation states.
[27:27.220 --> 27:31.220]  There are only cities that are the capitals of the corporations.
[27:31.220 --> 27:37.220]  Well, if you actually read what the most group of the CFR's or Lionel Commission say in the year 2020,
[27:37.220 --> 27:40.220]  that is their in game, that is their goal.
[27:40.220 --> 27:48.220]  So we're talking about hunger games type scenario here run by very, very, very ruthless people to see us as shadow.
[27:48.220 --> 27:52.220]  They're using COVID-19 as their takeover strategy and communist China as their model.
[27:52.220 --> 27:54.220]  We must reject it now.
[27:54.220 --> 27:59.220]  And perhaps, most cruelly of all, if Donald Trump has his way,
[27:59.220 --> 28:06.220]  the complications from COVID-19, which are well beyond what they should be,
[28:06.220 --> 28:10.220]  it's estimated that 200 million people have died.
[28:10.220 --> 28:13.220]  200 million people have died.
[28:13.220 --> 28:16.220]  Probably by the time I finish this talk.
[28:16.220 --> 28:22.220]  Right after Joe Biden made that statement that more than 60 percent of America has died from COVID-19
[28:22.220 --> 28:24.220]  when it's not even 200,000 in reality,
[28:24.220 --> 28:28.220]  he would want to say 6 million have lung scarring and heart damage.
[28:28.220 --> 28:29.220]  It's all made up.
[28:29.220 --> 28:30.220]  But you know where he got it?
[28:30.220 --> 28:33.220]  The mainstream media that continues to actually say things like that.
[28:33.220 --> 28:38.220]  They said that 4 percent of America would be dead already.
[28:38.220 --> 28:43.220]  Of course, it's 0.0000 and then add a number because the numbers vary.
[28:43.220 --> 28:47.220]  It's a real virus, just like people being struck by lightning is real.
[28:47.220 --> 28:53.220]  But to shut down society over lightning strikes is hysteria and is mind control.
[28:53.220 --> 28:55.220]  I've got some bad news for you.
[28:55.220 --> 28:58.220]  I've got some really bad news and I've got some good news.
[28:58.220 --> 29:03.220]  The bad news is, even if Trump gets re-elected, they're going to still trigger attempts at martial law,
[29:03.220 --> 29:06.220]  medical lockdowns, race riots, and a depression.
[29:06.220 --> 29:07.220]  That's the globalists.
[29:07.220 --> 29:09.220]  They're trying to bring America to our knees.
[29:09.220 --> 29:14.220]  Now, if Trump doesn't get elected, they're still planning to bring us to our knees
[29:14.220 --> 29:18.220]  and really try to break our will and bring us into a super intense depression,
[29:18.220 --> 29:21.220]  total control, and like Australia is already doing,
[29:21.220 --> 29:24.220]  rounding up and arresting people that criticize what the left are doing.
[29:24.220 --> 29:26.220]  That's the really bad news.
[29:26.220 --> 29:30.220]  The good news is, this has triggered people out of their sleep all over the world
[29:30.220 --> 29:33.220]  and the resistance is mounting and the globalists are panicking.
[29:33.220 --> 29:37.220]  So, bottom line, we're in the fight, we're starting to win, but it's serious.
[29:37.220 --> 29:41.220]  So, pray to God for a global awakening, support InfoWars,
[29:41.220 --> 29:43.220]  spread the word, and buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[29:43.220 --> 29:48.220]  Literally, we're having an emergency keep InfoWars sale happening right now.
[29:48.220 --> 29:50.220]  Please visit InfoWarsStore and keep us on air.
[29:50.220 --> 29:57.220]  Thank you so much.
[30:20.220 --> 30:24.220]  So, the United Nations came out and said we want contact tracers worldwide.
[30:24.220 --> 30:27.220]  We want apps on your phones, to buy and sell, fly on airplanes.
[30:27.220 --> 30:31.220]  You'll have to have inoculation before you're allowed to travel.
[30:31.220 --> 30:34.220]  And so now, six, seven, eight months later, all across the world,
[30:34.220 --> 30:40.220]  exactly what the UN wants and the corporations that control it are being rolled out.
[30:40.220 --> 30:44.220]  Now, there is major pushback by the U.S. Attorney General, by Elon Musk,
[30:44.220 --> 30:45.220]  by so many others.
[30:45.220 --> 30:48.220]  I'll give you some of the good news in a moment.
[30:48.220 --> 30:51.220]  But first, let's go back to the video we were talking about.
[30:51.220 --> 30:58.220]  A member of parliament, Tobias Elwood, urges mandatory corona vaccination to be allowed to travel.
[30:58.220 --> 31:01.220]  And then they'll go, oh, polls show the majority support it.
[31:01.220 --> 31:05.220]  Of course, those are fake polls, but regardless,
[31:05.220 --> 31:09.220]  it doesn't matter if 51% want me to take a deadly vaccine.
[31:09.220 --> 31:12.220]  In a republic, I'm not forced to do that.
[31:12.220 --> 31:15.220]  Under common law, I'm not forced to do what the majority wants.
[31:15.220 --> 31:19.220]  That's my body, right?
[31:19.220 --> 31:24.220]  Plus, if you've taken it, you're supposedly protected then, right?
[31:24.220 --> 31:26.220]  Oh, but of course, you're not.
[31:26.220 --> 31:32.220]  They've got this new mRNA vaccine that goes in and reprograms your cells and makes everyone sick.
[31:32.220 --> 31:34.220]  And they admit you're a guinea pig.
[31:34.220 --> 31:35.220]  What?
[31:35.220 --> 31:37.220]  From Bill Gates, our new doctor?
[31:37.220 --> 31:40.220]  Come on, folks.
[31:40.220 --> 31:42.220]  This isn't just classical tyranny.
[31:42.220 --> 31:44.220]  This is over-the-top ridiculous.
[31:44.220 --> 31:46.220]  So here's Tobias Elwood.
[31:46.220 --> 31:49.220]  How about the military making you take your vaccine?
[31:49.220 --> 31:50.220]  Here it is.
[31:50.220 --> 31:53.220]  We face six more months of hardship.
[31:53.220 --> 31:55.220]  And it's absolutely right.
[31:55.220 --> 31:56.220]  Oh, well, hit pause.
[31:56.220 --> 31:57.220]  Parliament.
[31:57.220 --> 32:01.220]  It's always six months, six months, six months, six months.
[32:01.220 --> 32:09.220]  Look at this little boy, this little establishment fob in here for the big globalist to keep the UK under martial law,
[32:09.220 --> 32:16.220]  keep everybody locked down and give everybody a deeper debt to kill the real economy so everyone is dependent on the mega banks that are essential.
[32:16.220 --> 32:18.220]  This is the enemy of humanity.
[32:18.220 --> 32:24.220]  Let's continue.
[32:24.220 --> 32:27.220]  You guys able to play that?
[32:27.220 --> 32:53.220]  Thank you very much.
[32:53.220 --> 33:00.220]  Well, thank God.
[33:00.220 --> 33:07.220]  But the scale and complexity of this challenge is up there with the D-Day landings and indeed Dunkirk.
[33:07.220 --> 33:08.220]  And to put it politely.
[33:08.220 --> 33:11.220]  The D-Day, pause again.
[33:11.220 --> 33:14.220]  This is on scale with World War II.
[33:14.220 --> 33:17.220]  They said 500,000 Brits would die and it was 50,000.
[33:17.220 --> 33:19.220]  Most of those died of something else.
[33:19.220 --> 33:21.220]  They said 2.5 million Americans would die.
[33:21.220 --> 33:23.220]  It's only 200,000 now.
[33:23.220 --> 33:24.220]  Most of those other deaths.
[33:24.220 --> 33:26.220]  This is a total damn hoax.
[33:26.220 --> 33:30.220]  And if you try to go protest it, you get arrested down the street from there.
[33:30.220 --> 33:32.220]  40-something thousand people show up.
[33:32.220 --> 33:34.220]  Here comes the police with billy clubs.
[33:34.220 --> 33:39.220]  This is incredible because they're going for broke, folks.
[33:39.220 --> 33:45.220]  They're bankrupting the UK because they did Briggs it and got out of the new world order.
[33:45.220 --> 33:47.220]  They're trying to bankrupt the US because we got out.
[33:47.220 --> 33:49.220]  China is open for business.
[33:49.220 --> 33:54.220]  And now because the UK and the US are reopening, they're doing the Kabuki Theatre.
[33:54.220 --> 33:55.220]  Oh, look, it's dangerous.
[33:55.220 --> 33:57.220]  We can't reopen now.
[33:57.220 --> 33:58.220]  Let's go back to this person.
[33:58.220 --> 34:04.220]  In Parliament in the UK wants the military to make you take shots before you can get on airplanes.
[34:04.220 --> 34:07.220]  But he says you have to stay locked down till they get the shot.
[34:07.220 --> 34:11.220]  That's why they want to keep moving the goalposts back to keep you under martial law.
[34:11.220 --> 34:17.220]  That's why Trump went, oh no, we'll get a vaccine now to just make them shut the whole lockdown down.
[34:17.220 --> 34:18.220]  Let's go back to him.
[34:18.220 --> 34:19.220]  Let's join.
[34:48.220 --> 34:53.220]  The armed forces have the capacity, the logistical experience and the national reach
[34:53.220 --> 34:59.220]  and are not overburdened by any current duties involving tackling COVID-19
[34:59.220 --> 35:02.220]  to take on this mammoth, an incredible task.
[35:02.220 --> 35:05.220]  And when you pause to consider what is involved,
[35:05.220 --> 35:10.220]  the logistics of shifting millions of refrigerated vaccines across the country,
[35:10.220 --> 35:15.220]  the creation of regional distribution hubs which then feed into mobile testing centres,
[35:15.220 --> 35:21.220]  developing a national database to track, progress and issue the vaccinations certificate.
[35:21.220 --> 35:22.220]  Pause.
[35:22.220 --> 35:23.220]  This is it.
[35:23.220 --> 35:31.220]  This is the military, globalist, UN, pharma, tracking surveillance, political,
[35:31.220 --> 35:36.220]  disappear you in the middle of the night, forced inoculation program with a vaccine they admit
[35:36.220 --> 35:39.220]  can hurt you or kill you to take control of your life.
[35:39.220 --> 35:46.220]  This is their bipartisan global crime move against you and your family.
[35:46.220 --> 35:50.220]  And it sets the precedent for hundreds of new vaccines to be put in your body,
[35:50.220 --> 35:54.220]  including the new mRNA vaccines that make you a GMO product.
[35:54.220 --> 35:56.220]  This is war.
[35:56.220 --> 35:57.220]  This is war.
[35:57.220 --> 36:04.220]  And he's coming with a weapon, with this poison, with this liability protected fraud,
[36:04.220 --> 36:10.220]  with the military, with a voice of authority to, you heard him, a strong voice of authority
[36:10.220 --> 36:14.220]  to come and make you do this.
[36:14.220 --> 36:20.220]  And when you convulse and die, they will cover it up or they will spin it.
[36:20.220 --> 36:23.220]  They are coming to shoot you with a deadly poison.
[36:23.220 --> 36:27.220]  They're coming to assault you and you have every right to defend yourself.
[36:27.220 --> 36:28.220]  This is the line in the sand.
[36:28.220 --> 36:29.220]  The authoritarians are coming.
[36:29.220 --> 36:30.220]  All the games are over.
[36:30.220 --> 36:31.220]  All the jokes are over.
[36:31.220 --> 36:34.220]  We warned you.
[36:34.220 --> 36:38.220]  And so they trigger race war to make it look like the police are under attack,
[36:38.220 --> 36:41.220]  but it's really because the globalists are taking control of the police.
[36:41.220 --> 36:46.220]  Nobody cares when Brad Parskills walks out of his house peacefully and gets tackled by the police.
[36:46.220 --> 36:50.220]  Oh, that's a good thing, because the police are following the globalist orders.
[36:50.220 --> 36:52.220]  Then they can do no wrong.
[36:52.220 --> 36:57.220]  So they don't let a communist group burn down the city hall and take control of the city,
[36:57.220 --> 36:58.220]  but the police are bad.
[36:58.220 --> 37:00.220]  But the police are just like the public.
[37:00.220 --> 37:02.220]  They're going to follow their globalist orders.
[37:02.220 --> 37:05.220]  They want brownie points from CNN, even though CNN has no support.
[37:05.220 --> 37:07.220]  It's all about being cowards.
[37:07.220 --> 37:09.220]  It's all about being yes men.
[37:09.220 --> 37:14.220]  Look at the photo of that sack of garbage Tobias Elwood put out.
[37:14.220 --> 37:19.220]  He put out a photo of himself looking like a lunatic psycho child molester.
[37:19.220 --> 37:22.220]  He thinks he looks good there because he has no connection to reality.
[37:22.220 --> 37:24.220]  He doesn't know what he looks like.
[37:24.220 --> 37:29.220]  He looks like a power mad megalomaniac loon in the photo.
[37:29.220 --> 37:31.220]  But hey, looks to me deceiving.
[37:31.220 --> 37:32.220]  Maybe he's not.
[37:32.220 --> 37:36.220]  Oh, he wants the military to forcibly inoculate you to buy and sell and leave your house.
[37:36.220 --> 37:39.220]  Let's continue.
[37:39.220 --> 37:44.220]  You have to be internationally recognized in order to allow travel, international travel,
[37:44.220 --> 37:48.220]  as well as establishing the order of who is prioritized first.
[37:48.220 --> 37:51.220]  Key workers, the vulnerable, teachers, for example.
[37:51.220 --> 37:53.220]  And then with more detailed questions.
[37:53.220 --> 37:56.220]  Oh, see, who's going to be allowed to travel?
[37:56.220 --> 37:58.220]  Oh, you're going to have to beg for it.
[37:58.220 --> 37:59.220]  Sorry, you didn't.
[37:59.220 --> 38:00.220]  You can't get the shot.
[38:00.220 --> 38:01.220]  It's rationed.
[38:01.220 --> 38:02.220]  You can't travel now.
[38:02.220 --> 38:03.220]  So you're going to beg for it.
[38:03.220 --> 38:04.220]  Oh, please give me the bill.
[38:04.220 --> 38:05.220]  Good shot.
[38:05.220 --> 38:06.220]  Please.
[38:06.220 --> 38:07.220]  Please.
[38:07.220 --> 38:08.220]  Please.
[38:08.220 --> 38:11.220]  Vaccinate the children.
[38:11.220 --> 38:13.220]  All these must be answered.
[38:13.220 --> 38:14.220]  Oh, children.
[38:14.220 --> 38:15.220]  Yes.
[38:15.220 --> 38:16.220]  How much you like them?
[38:16.220 --> 38:20.220]  Now, with the coordination of Whitehall departments, local authorities, the private sector,
[38:20.220 --> 38:24.220]  policing and security, as well as the military military support to consider,
[38:24.220 --> 38:31.220]  I hope I make the case for why we need to start thinking about this now.
[38:31.220 --> 38:37.220]  I also believe that the biggest challenge will be in managing the transition period potentially
[38:37.220 --> 38:43.220]  up to a year when parts of our society are liberated from the threat of COVID-19 and
[38:43.220 --> 38:48.220]  would like to seek to return to normality and those who have yet to be vaccinated but
[38:48.220 --> 38:51.220]  still subject to the continued social distancing.
[38:51.220 --> 38:52.220]  Oh, see.
[38:52.220 --> 38:55.220]  We need to get the planning right today so we can avoid-
[38:55.220 --> 38:56.220]  And that will be on your app.
[38:56.220 --> 38:57.220]  I've got my app.
[38:57.220 --> 38:58.220]  I'm allowed to be out.
[38:58.220 --> 38:59.220]  You're not.
[38:59.220 --> 39:01.220]  And they'll say, do you have the app?
[39:01.220 --> 39:02.220]  Oh, he doesn't have it.
[39:02.220 --> 39:03.220]  Report him.
[39:03.220 --> 39:04.220]  It's a new class.
[39:04.220 --> 39:06.220]  I've had all my shots, all 75 this year.
[39:06.220 --> 39:07.220]  Yes, I'm in a wheelchair.
[39:07.220 --> 39:08.220]  Yes, I'm dying.
[39:08.220 --> 39:10.220]  But I'm allowed to go outside.
[39:10.220 --> 39:12.220]  I'm so incredible.
[39:12.220 --> 39:19.220]  Madam Deputy Speaker, there is huge scope for this going wrong if we don't start to plan
[39:19.220 --> 39:20.220]  now.
[39:20.220 --> 39:26.220]  This is a criminal that wants to come put deadly substances in your body so you can leave your
[39:26.220 --> 39:27.220]  house with the military.
[39:27.220 --> 39:28.220]  Is he a danger?
[39:28.220 --> 39:29.220]  Is he a threat?
[39:29.220 --> 39:32.220]  Yes, he's the second coming of that off Hitler.
[39:32.220 --> 39:39.220]  Tobias Ellwood and all of them are horrible little corporate demons who want total power
[39:39.220 --> 39:40.220]  over you and your family.
[39:40.220 --> 39:42.220]  You think that little monster is going to take a vaccine?
[39:42.220 --> 39:43.220]  Absolutely not.
[39:43.220 --> 39:47.220]  You think that bug-eyed monster is going to do that to himself?
[39:47.220 --> 39:49.220]  No, he's going to stick it in you and your children.
[39:49.220 --> 39:53.220]  He wants to stick it in your children.
[39:53.220 --> 39:57.220]  The way the psychological warfare operation works is very, very simple.
[39:57.220 --> 40:00.220]  They get you about freedoms by increments.
[40:00.220 --> 40:04.220]  Always promising it's only going to be a short period of time, and then the restrictions
[40:04.220 --> 40:07.220]  will be released, but they're not.
[40:07.220 --> 40:11.220]  They have a significant amount of time, always four or five times longer than what they said.
[40:11.220 --> 40:16.220]  They will then slightly release it a little bit to only tighten it down even more later.
[40:16.220 --> 40:22.220]  This is called successive approximation incrementalism or the inchworm effect.
[40:22.220 --> 40:27.220]  This is the most common way that the vegetarians take over, but there then becomes a point
[40:27.220 --> 40:29.220]  where the public wakes up.
[40:29.220 --> 40:33.220]  Under the incrementalism, he starts resisting, and then there's usually a giant purge and
[40:33.220 --> 40:38.220]  a clamp down, and you'll see more tyranny rolled out in just a few days, weeks or months
[40:38.220 --> 40:40.220]  than you saw in the previous ten years.
[40:40.220 --> 40:43.220]  And that's the period we're in globally right now.
[40:43.220 --> 40:49.220]  A world government, chai combat, globalist corporate takeover of the planet that wants
[40:49.220 --> 40:53.220]  you poor and absolutely sick under their thumb forever.
[40:53.220 --> 40:57.220]  Remember the Global Lockdowns you're witnessing.
[40:57.220 --> 41:03.220]  The Black Lives Matter, antiferriots, and racial attacks we're all seeing are publicly
[41:03.220 --> 41:09.220]  directed by a handful of top billionaires, led by people like Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos,
[41:09.220 --> 41:12.220]  of course, Tim Cook, and others.
[41:12.220 --> 41:17.220]  They sit up there with their trillions of dollars they control in their companies.
[41:17.220 --> 41:22.220]  And they're hundreds of billions of dollars individually leveraging that against us and
[41:22.220 --> 41:27.220]  trying to create an artificial revolution against local government and police.
[41:27.220 --> 41:31.220]  And the mayors are, again, they're playing their political game to try to trigger the
[41:31.220 --> 41:35.220]  complete breakdown of the United States and Western Europe to show these billionaires
[41:35.220 --> 41:38.220]  could come in and buy it all up for billions on the dollar.
[41:38.220 --> 41:42.220]  That's why I'm so angry that these globalists, because when you're looking at them, they're
[41:42.220 --> 41:47.220]  the ones that sit in their councils and have decided to run these plans against us.
[41:47.220 --> 41:50.220]  They are enemies of humanity and must be dealt with.
[41:50.220 --> 41:52.220]  It's us or them, period.
[41:54.220 --> 42:02.220]  Hello, my name is Dr. Fauci, and I've been at the NIH and CDC for 45 years.
[42:02.220 --> 42:07.220]  And I've overseen well, you know, the AIDS pandemic and so many other things.
[42:07.220 --> 42:12.220]  And I take my orders from Bill Gates, Dr. Bill Gates.
[42:12.220 --> 42:17.220]  I mean, he's not a doctor, but he controls everything you do.
[42:17.220 --> 42:20.220]  And he now says you're going to take the shots.
[42:20.220 --> 42:26.220]  And of course, in England, they are now saying, when I told you, you will not be allowed to travel.
[42:26.220 --> 42:30.220]  Leave your home until you take all the shots.
[42:30.220 --> 42:39.220]  Dr. Gates, I mean Bill Gates, your owner, your master says you will have to take four to five COVID shots a year
[42:39.220 --> 42:49.220]  for adult, two for baby, baby, much more manageable, just like Bill Gates give you polio and vaccine.
[42:49.220 --> 42:54.220]  I'm Dr. Fauci, reminding you that we owe you.
[42:54.220 --> 42:59.220]  If you look at the top tech billionaires and the big banks that finance and control them,
[42:59.220 --> 43:04.220]  to a man and to a woman, they believe there's too many people on the earth and they constantly whine about
[43:04.220 --> 43:09.220]  when they want to go to a mountain top or a national park, they have to look at us, the common people.
[43:09.220 --> 43:12.220]  They have to look at the proletariat, they have to look at the scum.
[43:12.220 --> 43:15.220]  That's why they love the lockdown, putting muzzles on us.
[43:15.220 --> 43:19.220]  That gives them a big thrill controlling where we can go, what we can do.
[43:19.220 --> 43:25.220]  Bankrupting Main Street, bankrupting small towns, all of it is a vertical integration consolidation
[43:25.220 --> 43:32.220]  so they can then dictate the terms of our total surrender, which is taking sterilant vaccines day one.
[43:32.220 --> 43:36.220]  Ladies and gentlemen, all the games are over, playtime's over.
[43:36.220 --> 43:41.220]  They used all the entertainment and garbage to put us into a trance and now the spider's moving in for the kill.
[43:41.220 --> 43:44.220]  You know this, I know this, it's all out in the open.
[43:44.220 --> 43:46.220]  The question is, what are we going to do about it?
[43:46.220 --> 43:48.220]  Well, the first thing is identify the enemy.
[43:48.220 --> 43:56.220]  Identify the enemy, identify the enemy, identify your enemy now.
[43:56.220 --> 44:05.220]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[44:05.220 --> 44:19.220]  Putting a national lockdown stay at home orders is like house arrest.
[44:19.220 --> 44:21.220]  It's other than slavery, which was a different kind of restraint.
[44:21.220 --> 44:26.220]  This is the greatest intrusion on civil liberties in American history.
[44:26.220 --> 44:32.220]  And now they're coming with forced inoculations that they admit are given liability protection
[44:32.220 --> 44:35.220]  and make you real sick and don't even protect you.
[44:35.220 --> 44:41.220]  And the guy that architected it all, Bill Gates, ran the Wuhan lab with Fauci developing the very virus.
[44:41.220 --> 44:47.220]  And then Communist China comes out and brags, they've used it to defeat America and shut us down
[44:47.220 --> 44:52.220]  and they're wide open for business and their leftist cohorts are doing it to bring us down.
[44:52.220 --> 44:55.220]  And the Democrats say no borders, no wall, no USA at all.
[44:55.220 --> 44:58.220]  They say America sucks, clowered and pivot.
[44:58.220 --> 45:00.220]  They want to bankrupt things to make you dependent.
[45:00.220 --> 45:06.220]  They can't compete with capitalism, so they want to wreck it and then own it for themselves.
[45:06.220 --> 45:13.220]  So you just heard our attorney general say that this is the greatest form of oppression since slavery,
[45:13.220 --> 45:15.220]  because that's what it is.
[45:15.220 --> 45:20.220]  You just heard the British Member of Parliament say we're going to have the military with strong force,
[45:20.220 --> 45:26.220]  make you take this, and then those that don't can't travel anymore and can't leave your house.
[45:26.220 --> 45:32.220]  We're going to make you beg for the vaccine. It's going to take a long time for you to get it so you can even travel, period.
[45:32.220 --> 45:35.220]  This is called being held hostage. It's called being a captive.
[45:35.220 --> 45:39.220]  And notice, I warn everybody, I said all the censorship isn't just for me.
[45:39.220 --> 45:41.220]  It's going to be for all of you.
[45:41.220 --> 45:44.220]  It's going to be for nationalists and pro-freedom leaders.
[45:44.220 --> 45:48.220]  And now they're shutting down Trump, Bolsonaro and others.
[45:48.220 --> 45:53.220]  Boris Johnson at first came out against the lockdown, but then the Chinese bots and the media all hit him
[45:53.220 --> 45:56.220]  and he flipped sort of the Governor Greg Abbott.
[45:56.220 --> 45:59.220]  And so we're not just being led into normal tyranny.
[45:59.220 --> 46:05.220]  We're being led into a super high-tech, ultra-evil system where they are putting God knows what.
[46:05.220 --> 46:12.220]  I mean, we already know with the mRNA vaccines, 100% get sick, 20% go to the hospital.
[46:12.220 --> 46:15.220]  And that's just what's happening right away.
[46:15.220 --> 46:20.220]  I mean, you want me to play Bill Gates admitting 100% get sick?
[46:20.220 --> 46:23.220]  And he says, we're never reopening. It starts giggling.
[46:23.220 --> 46:26.220]  And even the CBS lady looks sick because she's figuring it out.
[46:26.220 --> 46:29.220]  What good is all that money, lady, when your kids are going to be sterilized
[46:29.220 --> 46:33.220]  and you're going to be mentally retarded?
[46:33.220 --> 46:35.220]  So you wonder what's wrong with the public?
[46:35.220 --> 46:39.220]  The same globalists have been putting fluoride in our water since the late 40s.
[46:39.220 --> 46:45.220]  All the studies show that hydrofluorosolicylic acid lowers IQ, lowers fertility.
[46:45.220 --> 46:52.220]  Gives you kidney cancer, liver cancer, pancreatic cancer, bladder cancer, bone cancer.
[46:52.220 --> 46:56.220]  You think I'm just saying this? Harvard did 25 studies over the decade
[46:56.220 --> 47:00.220]  and said conclusively, hydrofluorosolicylic acid should be taken out.
[47:00.220 --> 47:05.220]  But is it out? No, they're increasing the level.
[47:05.220 --> 47:07.220]  You think Bill Gates drinks that fluoride?
[47:07.220 --> 47:10.220]  He needs you dumbed down to be above you.
[47:10.220 --> 47:17.220]  He's supposedly an elitist, so he needs you to be dumbed down and poisoned so he can feel better than you.
[47:17.220 --> 47:20.220]  So you just heard the Attorney General. Here's Elon Musk.
[47:20.220 --> 47:23.220]  It's a podcast interview. We're going to get these clips cut out.
[47:23.220 --> 47:27.220]  It's a 45-minute-long podcast. We'll have it by the time Paul Watson comes on.
[47:27.220 --> 47:29.220]  But let me just read you what he had to say.
[47:29.220 --> 47:34.220]  Because I get mad at Musk with some of this, you know, brain chip stuff and all the rest of it.
[47:34.220 --> 47:37.220]  But that's voluntary if you want to get the brain chip from Elon Musk.
[47:37.220 --> 47:40.220]  All right, on COVID-19 and FullWars.com article.
[47:40.220 --> 47:43.220]  Elon Musk says COVID-19 vaccine for his family.
[47:43.220 --> 47:48.220]  Elon Musk says no COVID-19, no COVID-19 vaccine for his family.
[47:48.220 --> 47:50.220]  Blast knucklehead Bill Gates.
[47:50.220 --> 47:56.220]  SpaceX Tesla founder Elon Musk has said that neither he nor his family will likely take future coronavirus vaccines
[47:56.220 --> 47:58.220]  even though they are readily available.
[47:58.220 --> 48:02.220]  Seeing the pandemic has diminished his faith in humanity.
[48:02.220 --> 48:08.220]  Speaking during a podcast interview with Kara Swisher, 49-year-old Musk stated
[48:08.220 --> 48:11.220]  that neither he nor his children are at risk of COVID-19.
[48:11.220 --> 48:14.220]  Therefore, should he be ultimately need to the vaccine?
[48:14.220 --> 48:16.220]  So therefore, he should not need it.
[48:16.220 --> 48:20.220]  You want to say it's unlikely. This is a no-in situation.
[48:20.220 --> 48:25.220]  It has diminished my faith in humanity, the whole thing, the irrationality of people in general.
[48:25.220 --> 48:28.220]  Because it statistically is very hard to die from it.
[48:28.220 --> 48:32.220]  He also described lockdowns across the globe and the U.S. in particular,
[48:32.220 --> 48:37.220]  having previously referred to them as unethical and de facto house arrest.
[48:37.220 --> 48:39.220]  Well, that's what it is.
[48:39.220 --> 48:47.220]  Musk said widespread lockdowns were a mistake and only at-risk people should quarantine until the storm passes.
[48:47.220 --> 48:49.220]  See, the storm is never going to pass.
[48:49.220 --> 48:53.220]  When pressed about the risk of his own employees and their families,
[48:53.220 --> 49:00.220]  with Swisher asking what if someone dies, Musk pithily replied, everybody dies.
[49:00.220 --> 49:04.220]  We've been making cars this entire time and it's been great.
[49:04.220 --> 49:08.220]  He said of the Tesla keeping its factory doors open into finance of lockdown rules.
[49:08.220 --> 49:11.220]  Remember? It was all supposed to be 15 days.
[49:11.220 --> 49:14.220]  Oh, we're now eight months in.
[49:14.220 --> 49:19.220]  Which at one point prompted the irate response from Musk and even a lawsuit against Alameda County.
[49:19.220 --> 49:23.220]  He added that SpaceX has been fully operational throughout the pandemic,
[49:23.220 --> 49:25.220]  thanks to the national security clearance.
[49:25.220 --> 49:29.220]  And of course, no one's died at his factories. It's all made up.
[49:29.220 --> 49:31.220]  For this entire thing, we did not skip a day.
[49:31.220 --> 49:35.220]  We had national security clearance because we're doing national security work.
[49:35.220 --> 49:37.220]  We sent astronauts to space stationed in back.
[49:37.220 --> 49:39.220]  Musk also took aim at Bill Gates,
[49:39.220 --> 49:45.220]  highlighting that his fellow billionaire criticism of lockdown skeptics are unfounded and misplaced in Musk's case.
[49:45.220 --> 49:49.220]  Gates said something about me not knowing what I was doing. It's like, hey, Knucklehead,
[49:49.220 --> 49:53.220]  we actually make a vaccine machines for CureVac.
[49:53.220 --> 50:00.220]  The company you've invested in must explain referring to the fact that Tesla manufacturer of machines and CureVac,
[50:00.220 --> 50:04.220]  the entrepreneur also noted that works closely with Harvard epidemiology teams,
[50:04.220 --> 50:08.220]  which is currently working on a COVID-19 antibody studies.
[50:08.220 --> 50:12.220]  So that's another homerun for Elon Musk.
[50:12.220 --> 50:17.220]  Meanwhile, coming up next hour, I'm going to open the phones up.
[50:17.220 --> 50:19.220]  And we have several special guests that are going to be joining us.
[50:19.220 --> 50:22.220]  They'll tell you about next hour. But here's more solution,
[50:22.220 --> 50:25.220]  not just standing up and speaking out, taking action.
[50:25.220 --> 50:30.220]  Minnesota Rep says he exposed Elon Omer's cash for votes allegations.
[50:30.220 --> 50:34.220]  This is a Kit Daniels article because FBI stonewalled him.
[50:34.220 --> 50:36.220]  And we're all being safe.
[50:36.220 --> 50:43.220]  Seeing allegations since it's like saying there's an allegation that a pine tree has pine needles or that bears live in the woods.
[50:43.220 --> 50:48.220]  I mean, it's it's a fact that's pouring in new video of the cash payoff taking place and more next hour.
[50:48.220 --> 50:53.220]  But the point was the FBI refused to investigate it and even said it does not exist.
[50:53.220 --> 50:56.220]  Democrat election fraud does not exist.
[50:56.220 --> 50:59.220]  And Hitler didn't have a mustache either.
[50:59.220 --> 51:02.220]  So that's all coming up.
[51:02.220 --> 51:07.220]  But please remember, you're awake. You know what's going on. The enemy is trying to suppress and censor everyone.
[51:07.220 --> 51:14.220]  When you word of mouth, take the live feed from info wars.com.
[51:14.220 --> 51:19.220]  We have a headline up there today about live election coverage starts now.
[51:19.220 --> 51:23.220]  And you share it and say, here's the forbidden coverage you're not supposed to see.
[51:23.220 --> 51:26.220]  Please check it out. If you like it, share it.
[51:26.220 --> 51:34.220]  And humans understand that innately that how to get around censorship and how to communicate.
[51:34.220 --> 51:37.220]  Information.
[51:37.220 --> 51:43.220]  So now more than ever share that live link from news wars.com or 2020 election center.com.
[51:43.220 --> 51:51.220]  Those URLs don't get censored as much or right from the old info wars.com with the headline.
[51:51.220 --> 51:57.220]  Exclusive live coverage of the first Trump Biden presidential debate is live.
[51:57.220 --> 52:00.220]  Click below and share.
[52:00.220 --> 52:10.220]  Alex Jones, Paul Joseph Watson, Owen Stroyer, Deanna Lorraine, Robert Barnes, Harrison Smith and fours reporters on the ground and Cleveland and many others are providing live up to the date.
[52:10.220 --> 52:16.220]  Up to the minute coverage share this broadcast if you want to defeat the globalist.
[52:16.220 --> 52:22.220]  And then also, ladies and gentlemen, I would get prepared. We've got some really exciting news here for everybody.
[52:22.220 --> 52:27.220]  I've really been pushing hard that everybody needs to get swarable food, whether Trump wins or loses.
[52:27.220 --> 52:30.220]  They're shutting down the world economy. Supply chains are breaking down.
[52:30.220 --> 52:35.220]  It was taken eight weeks for folks to get swarable food. We had the factories had the food that had to get it packaged.
[52:35.220 --> 52:40.220]  Now it's about a week for delivery. We have it ready to ship to you in high quality containers, high quality food.
[52:40.220 --> 52:44.220]  The lowest price you're going to find anywhere for high quality food.
[52:44.220 --> 52:50.220]  Well, folks got mad that at infoworkstore.com, we had all their specials, all their catalog, already the lowest you're going to get.
[52:50.220 --> 52:55.220]  But the special we were offering was a water filter and air filter and then a small three month supply.
[52:55.220 --> 53:01.220]  I said, OK, I heard you listeners of the new special runs until Monday and then it's over.
[53:01.220 --> 53:03.220]  The other special just ended.
[53:03.220 --> 53:13.220]  New week of massive savings that prepare with Alex.com or partnership with my patron supply to give you the lowest discounts possible on food has led to new ways to save preparing for you and your family for what's coming next.
[53:13.220 --> 53:20.220]  The last seven days we worked together to give you rock bottom prices on things you'll need for an emergency.
[53:20.220 --> 53:25.220]  And here they are $150 off the three month supply that is extended.
[53:25.220 --> 53:29.220]  Here's the new ones 300 off on a six month supply.
[53:29.220 --> 53:31.220]  They already lowest price out there for high quality food.
[53:31.220 --> 53:38.220]  600 off a one year food supply $40 off the Alexa pure pitcher water filter.
[53:38.220 --> 53:48.220]  And 25 off the ready hour wireless solar power pack charger and 28 led room like.
[53:48.220 --> 53:56.220]  So they are selling this very close to their costs and putting again some money in for us to fund our operation.
[53:56.220 --> 54:04.220]  $25 off the ready hour wireless solar power pack charger and 28 led room like that's an amazing deal.
[54:04.220 --> 54:12.220]  300 off six month food supply 600 off one year food supply 40% off Alexa pure pitcher water filtration system.
[54:12.220 --> 54:21.220]  That is an incredible deal on that pitcher cleanser water the thousands of gallons is a very, very low price already they have just slashed the bone.
[54:21.220 --> 54:26.220]  This is an unprecedented special prepare with Alex.com prepare with Alex.com.
[54:26.220 --> 54:28.220]  There's also a phone number there on the site.
[54:28.220 --> 54:33.220]  I'm out of time but when I plug it again for radio listeners, I'll give you that number prepare with Alex.com.
[54:33.220 --> 54:38.220]  And we have the other big special in force emergency election total blowout in case they shut everything down.
[54:38.220 --> 54:44.220]  We're trying to bring the funds in to operate into the future. Stay with us.
[54:44.220 --> 54:50.220]  I don't want to be negative about the prospects of the election, but I need to be honest with everybody.
[54:50.220 --> 54:56.220]  The Democrats and their deep state controllers, Congress, Chinese have come out and said they're going to contest the election.
[54:56.220 --> 54:58.220]  They know that Trump's going to win a landslide.
[54:58.220 --> 55:04.220]  And the destabilization that that's going to cause is going to further destroy the markets in the economy.
[55:04.220 --> 55:08.220]  And going into the future, even if Trump is able to prove that he's won the election.
[55:08.220 --> 55:21.220]  The Democrats have said they're going to break away politically and culturally into the blue states and blue cities and basically use that as a pretext of sabotage the Republic even more.
[55:21.220 --> 55:31.220]  So until this cancer is rooted out, until these criminals that work with foreign governments that are trying to basically destroy the country are punished and removed,
[55:31.220 --> 55:33.220]  it's just going to continue to happen.
[55:33.220 --> 55:35.220]  And so that's the big problem here.
[55:35.220 --> 55:41.220]  That is that we have stemming, dug in corruption by people that hate the country's very existence.
[55:41.220 --> 55:54.220]  Computer research scientists, engineers working with attorneys have conclusively proven and put out detailed reports at Tablet magazine,
[55:54.220 --> 55:58.220]  documenting what any trained eye could already see as plain as day.
[55:58.220 --> 56:13.220]  Communist Chinese working in tandem with the United Nations and the Democratic Party in the United States as well as the media put out fake videos and total hysteria to make it look like day of the dead into the world in China earlier this year.
[56:13.220 --> 56:20.220]  Then the UN put out standardized rules designed to keep the West locked down when China reopened within three months.
[56:20.220 --> 56:23.220]  This is the greatest strategic coup ever.
[56:23.220 --> 56:30.220]  This is 21st century warfare being carried out through psychological means for the ultimate style.
[56:30.220 --> 56:34.220]  Paul Joseph Watson has written about it at infowars.com.
[56:34.220 --> 56:37.220]  Myself, Alex Jones, David, and I know and sure are covering this heavily.
[56:37.220 --> 57:06.220]  This is the way to bring down the globalist is exposing how communist China and the UN were behind the hysteria.
[57:06.220 --> 57:13.220]  If you leave me, I won't miss you.
[57:13.220 --> 57:18.220]  And I won't ever take you back.
[57:18.220 --> 57:22.220]  Girl, your memory will never haunt me.
[57:22.220 --> 57:26.220]  You know, the globalists are arrogant because we never set up to them.
[57:26.220 --> 57:32.220]  They keep doubling down to pure martial law, total takeover, forced inoculation, and they say it's going to make you sick.
[57:32.220 --> 57:37.220]  But I can feel the pushback. I know I'm not putting up with it. Somebody tries to assault me with that.
[57:37.220 --> 57:40.220]  It's an assault the deadly weapon and I'll deal with that way.
[57:40.220 --> 57:43.220]  Your own notice globalist gloves are off.
[57:43.220 --> 57:47.220]  Let's go to this special report and we'll come back to the number out and take your calls.
[57:47.220 --> 57:52.220]  Tyrannical punks are feeling lucky.
[57:52.220 --> 58:17.220]  That was the last time you checked your tyranny watch because we are way past midnight.
[58:17.220 --> 58:25.220]  Most of us assume that our rights harboring this supposed ethical American society is like a rock that can't be moved.
[58:25.220 --> 58:31.220]  When in reality that boulder is being pushed over a cliff inch by inch bit by bit every day.
[58:31.220 --> 58:37.220]  A father was wounded after he shielded his three kids from gunfire at a Bronx car dealership.
[58:37.220 --> 58:41.220]  An ethical society would have helped him get back on his feet.
[58:41.220 --> 58:45.220]  He was fired from his two jobs for missing work instead.
[58:45.220 --> 58:48.220]  While freedom of speech has really taken a beating.
[58:48.220 --> 58:55.220]  A Louisville police officer had to step down over calling BLM punks which is a nice way of describing them.
[58:55.220 --> 59:00.220]  Being this is a 44 Magnets the most powerful handgun in the world and would blow your head clean off.
[59:00.220 --> 59:05.220]  You've got to ask yourself one question. Do I feel lucky?
[59:05.220 --> 59:08.220]  Well do you bunk?
[59:08.220 --> 59:13.220]  We are aware of these emails and we have been looking into them.
[59:13.220 --> 59:18.220]  They were her personal opinions and do not represent the views of this department.
[59:18.220 --> 59:28.220]  She has been relieved of her command of the Fifth Division and Major Hallehan has accepted responsibility for her emails and is retiring from the department.
[59:28.220 --> 59:34.220]  Also in Louisville a man protecting his business refused to bow to the Biden army of punks from BLM.
[59:34.220 --> 59:43.220]  If you want to tell the matter.
[59:43.220 --> 59:47.220]  If you want to tell the matter.
[59:47.220 --> 59:50.220]  How many people can't run me? Hold on a second.
[59:50.220 --> 59:54.220]  How many people can't run me out of jail? She was sleeping as she was left here.
[59:54.220 --> 59:58.220]  This is not a business. I don't believe it.
[59:58.220 --> 1:00:04.220]  In retaliation a business he owned was firebombed. Remind you of anything.
[1:00:04.220 --> 1:00:08.220]  But it's Joe Biden comparing Trump to Nazi propagandist Goebbels.
[1:00:08.220 --> 1:00:13.220]  I'm not sure anybody had already made up their mind there for Trump. Who knows.
[1:00:13.220 --> 1:00:19.220]  But that's sort of like Goebbels. You say the lie long enough, keep repeating, repeating, repeating.
[1:00:19.220 --> 1:00:21.220]  It becomes common knowledge.
[1:00:21.220 --> 1:00:26.220]  This is a man just months away from having his finger on the internet kill switch.
[1:00:26.220 --> 1:00:28.220]  Remember Obama put an internet kill switch in.
[1:00:28.220 --> 1:00:32.220]  Where only selective sites will be allowed to be heard, selective groups.
[1:00:32.220 --> 1:00:36.220]  Where the internet is only a few channels. Wherever you go you're basically fed the same thing.
[1:00:36.220 --> 1:00:41.220]  And this is internet kill switch. We're now Google, Facebook, Twitter, Apple.
[1:00:41.220 --> 1:00:48.220]  All of them are announcing we will not let Trump, Republicans or any of his supporters
[1:00:48.220 --> 1:00:54.220]  where they already have keywords blocked say he won or debated or show numbers that he really won.
[1:00:54.220 --> 1:01:00.220]  Biden's handlers would usher in a totalitarian Chinese century right into Main Street America.
[1:01:00.220 --> 1:01:05.220]  Mirroring the United Nations Bilderberg plan tyranny crushing freedom worldwide.
[1:01:05.220 --> 1:01:13.220]  Recently freedom of religion was completely disregarded in favor of tyranny in of all places Moscow, Idaho.
[1:01:13.220 --> 1:01:28.220]  You guys should not be doing this and doing this kind of crap for the mayor. This is embarrassing.
[1:01:28.220 --> 1:01:41.220]  If you are currently directly dealing with tyranny, why not take the time to push back?
[1:01:41.220 --> 1:01:52.220]  You can reach the chief of police James Fry of Moscow, Idaho at phone number 208-883-7000.
[1:01:52.220 --> 1:01:57.220]  Are you sick and tired of your calm peaceful life? Are you sleeping too well at night?
[1:01:57.220 --> 1:02:01.220]  Is your city too safe?
[1:02:01.220 --> 1:02:05.220]  Well not anymore. Introducing Democrats.
[1:02:05.220 --> 1:02:09.220]  Politicians so incompetent they'll fill your neighborhood with riots.
[1:02:09.220 --> 1:02:14.220]  Luding, rampant violence and even homelessness.
[1:02:14.220 --> 1:02:19.220]  The secret is a special blend of corruption and good old fashioned stupidity.
[1:02:19.220 --> 1:02:25.220]  No more pesky law and order. When Democrats are in charge nobody's safe.
[1:02:25.220 --> 1:02:30.220]  Simply vote for Democrats, sit back and watch your neighborhood burn to the ground.
[1:02:30.220 --> 1:02:38.220]  But wait, vote for Democrats now and they'll include rolling blackouts, election fraud, cancel culture,
[1:02:38.220 --> 1:02:45.220]  taxes and more taxes. Democrats bringing chaos right to your front door.
[1:02:45.220 --> 1:03:11.220]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[1:03:11.220 --> 1:03:18.220]  We are back live on this big debate day. I'm very excited about it.
[1:03:18.220 --> 1:03:22.220]  Tuesday, September 29, 2020.
[1:03:22.220 --> 1:03:28.220]  And I want to open the phones up here in the second hour ahead of Patrick Howley of National File and Epic Times joining us.
[1:03:28.220 --> 1:03:32.220]  Also we're going to have Greg Reese and our crew in Cleveland, Ohio.
[1:03:32.220 --> 1:03:37.220]  They're going to be having live coverage tonight. They'll be joining us the last 30 minutes of the next hour.
[1:03:37.220 --> 1:03:44.220]  And of course Paul Joseph Watson is kicking ass as usual. He'll be hosting the fourth hour ahead of the war with Owen Schreuer for three hours.
[1:03:44.220 --> 1:03:49.220]  And then we're going to go right through live commercial free starting at 6pm central.
[1:03:49.220 --> 1:03:54.220]  By commercial free. We'll still have a few breaks at the bottom of the start of the hour for stations.
[1:03:54.220 --> 1:03:58.220]  But those will be promos for us. Stations are welcome to do whatever the hell they want.
[1:03:58.220 --> 1:04:06.220]  We're free to air folks. That means just pick it up, cut it up, use it however you want. Run it straight, carry 10 minutes of it, whatever you want.
[1:04:06.220 --> 1:04:13.220]  We got it. Anything you want, you got it. Anything you need, you got it, baby.
[1:04:13.220 --> 1:04:22.220]  Wow. We are seeing a giant revolution according to Prince Philip and Prince Charles and the head of the Davos group ending our free society,
[1:04:22.220 --> 1:04:28.220]  ending the Renaissance, ending the wealth and all the big rich guys are the ones telling you you're going to be pouring out to save the earth.
[1:04:28.220 --> 1:04:32.220]  And really they just want total medical control over you to sterilize your ass.
[1:04:32.220 --> 1:04:37.220]  As Attorney General said, this is the greatest form of tyranny since slavery.
[1:04:37.220 --> 1:04:42.220]  And they're coming with forced inoculations. The UK is announced.
[1:04:42.220 --> 1:04:47.220]  Nigel Farage has come out against Boris Johnson.
[1:04:47.220 --> 1:04:51.220]  Total betrayal. SWAT teams, you know, attacking with Billy clubs.
[1:04:51.220 --> 1:04:56.220]  Anyone trying to demonstrate against the lockdown and everybody else that's a communist can demonstrate all day long.
[1:04:56.220 --> 1:05:08.220]  It's just a nightmare situation. Churches are shut down all over the world still, but the porn shops and liquor stores and universities and everything else are still open.
[1:05:08.220 --> 1:05:10.220]  This is what it's all about, folks.
[1:05:10.220 --> 1:05:15.220]  And by the way, everybody keeps lionizing the police. I'm going to give the number out. I want to explain something.
[1:05:15.220 --> 1:05:23.220]  Police carrying out constitutional duty and who have done nothing wrong are good people. On average, police aren't bad people.
[1:05:23.220 --> 1:05:31.220]  But in particular jurisdictions, in particular leftist leadership, they are nasty buggers.
[1:05:31.220 --> 1:05:35.220]  I mean, you look at the UK police, a shameful lot of trash on average.
[1:05:35.220 --> 1:05:41.220]  They have really converted into leftist social workers trained to have the stain for their own people,
[1:05:41.220 --> 1:05:47.220]  trained to absolutely carry out incredible oppression and to defend radical Islam, pedophilia, you name it.
[1:05:47.220 --> 1:05:55.220]  Either you're in Spain or whether you are in Italy or whether you are in Germany or whether you are in the UK.
[1:05:55.220 --> 1:06:02.220]  This is what you think of as a police state. They're following evil orders. They're oppressing good people, helping bad people.
[1:06:02.220 --> 1:06:06.220]  And they're just a bunch of cowards and they're a sick joke.
[1:06:06.220 --> 1:06:11.220]  I mean, these cops take their vaccines and have convulsions and some of them get paralyzed and die.
[1:06:11.220 --> 1:06:18.220]  They don't really care about them either. They're little bullies.
[1:06:18.220 --> 1:06:24.220]  And I wanted to play this clip. For radio listeners, I will narrate it.
[1:06:24.220 --> 1:06:29.220]  But Brad Parscales, who I've not been a fan of, I think he's been naive.
[1:06:29.220 --> 1:06:32.220]  I think he has taken too much money himself.
[1:06:32.220 --> 1:06:38.220]  He made deals with the Republican Party where he got a percentage of the ad buys. That's never before been done.
[1:06:38.220 --> 1:06:42.220]  He acts like he got Trump elected.
[1:06:42.220 --> 1:06:48.220]  I think Brad Parscales, a fellow Texan, is not a bad guy.
[1:06:48.220 --> 1:06:52.220]  I just think he's like a lot of people, nothing against really tall people.
[1:06:52.220 --> 1:06:55.220]  I don't have some short guy syndrome at 511. You know, I'm standing up straight.
[1:06:55.220 --> 1:06:59.220]  But he's like seven feet tall almost. I mean, he looks like the Jolly Green Giant.
[1:06:59.220 --> 1:07:03.220]  And so those huge guys just have this arrogant attitude, some of them.
[1:07:03.220 --> 1:07:07.220]  And I've been around and people have been around him. He's very, very arrogant.
[1:07:07.220 --> 1:07:10.220]  He's not lifted a finger to try to stop censorship.
[1:07:10.220 --> 1:07:15.220]  And I know he's buying Ferraris and $5 million houses. So I got a little pissed about that.
[1:07:15.220 --> 1:07:17.220]  Because that's for the campaign.
[1:07:17.220 --> 1:07:24.220]  But when I saw the raw three and a half minute footage from the bodycams of his wife coming out and going,
[1:07:24.220 --> 1:07:28.220]  oh, I thought I heard a gunshot in the house and he walks out with a Miller light.
[1:07:28.220 --> 1:07:32.220]  I was like, hey guys, what's going on in shorts? You can see he doesn't have a gun.
[1:07:32.220 --> 1:07:38.220]  His hands are out and they tackle him viciously.
[1:07:38.220 --> 1:07:43.220]  This is why police have a bad name. And this is wrong.
[1:07:43.220 --> 1:07:47.220]  And they put his knee on his head until he couldn't breathe. It'd be wrong as well.
[1:07:47.220 --> 1:07:51.220]  But you see so many cops are getting shot now when they don't go ahead and tackle somebody.
[1:07:51.220 --> 1:07:54.220]  The guy has a gun behind their waistband that they overreact.
[1:07:54.220 --> 1:07:58.220]  And that's why all this cop killing is endangering the police, the public and everybody else.
[1:07:58.220 --> 1:08:04.220]  And it's a very dangerous cycle. So let's go ahead and start this over here with them tackling him
[1:08:04.220 --> 1:08:08.220]  and going after him when he showed no sign of resisting, no sign of anything.
[1:08:08.220 --> 1:08:12.220]  This is very dangerous and very evil. Here it is.
[1:08:12.220 --> 1:08:16.220]  A nice white wrapper.
[1:08:16.220 --> 1:08:19.220]  Okay, come over here. That's fine.
[1:08:19.220 --> 1:08:21.220]  All right, relax.
[1:08:21.220 --> 1:08:23.220]  His wife's white range over there.
[1:08:23.220 --> 1:08:25.220]  What's going on?
[1:08:25.220 --> 1:08:29.220]  She's fucking pissed in the shit.
[1:08:29.220 --> 1:08:33.220]  He's not doing anything. Relax.
[1:08:33.220 --> 1:08:35.220]  What happened?
[1:08:35.220 --> 1:08:39.220]  So she started saying all this shit.
[1:08:39.220 --> 1:08:41.220]  Get in the ground, man. Get in the ground.
[1:08:41.220 --> 1:08:43.220]  Get in the ground, man.
[1:08:43.220 --> 1:08:45.220]  Fuck you, easy.
[1:08:45.220 --> 1:08:47.220]  I didn't do anything.
[1:08:47.220 --> 1:08:49.220]  I didn't do anything.
[1:08:49.220 --> 1:08:51.220]  I didn't do anything.
[1:08:51.220 --> 1:08:56.220]  I didn't do anything.
[1:08:56.220 --> 1:08:58.220]  Oh, we'll figure it out.
[1:08:58.220 --> 1:09:04.220]  If he wouldn't have kept his head up, he could have knocked his head in the ground and given him a concussion.
[1:09:04.220 --> 1:09:13.220]  So that's a deadly tactic on someone doing absolutely nothing.
[1:09:13.220 --> 1:09:17.220]  And that's all because the wife called and said he had a weapon.
[1:09:17.220 --> 1:09:23.220]  That's all you got to say about half the cases women, as we know, make that up because that's what you're supposed to do now.
[1:09:23.220 --> 1:09:26.220]  It's like the magic thing to do in an argument.
[1:09:26.220 --> 1:09:30.220]  Let's watch that again for TV viewers, just the part where they tackle him.
[1:09:30.220 --> 1:09:35.220]  He's got his hands out in not up, but like the sign of like, hey, what do you want?
[1:09:35.220 --> 1:09:37.220]  Everything's fine. His hands are out.
[1:09:37.220 --> 1:09:39.220]  He's wearing shorts. Boom.
[1:09:39.220 --> 1:09:46.220]  And then the cop jumps on him, knees him, knocks him down.
[1:09:46.220 --> 1:09:49.220]  And then they act like he's resisting arrest and do all this stuff.
[1:09:49.220 --> 1:09:52.220]  And that's because we've converted to a prison country.
[1:09:52.220 --> 1:09:54.220]  We have prisons in the prisons.
[1:09:54.220 --> 1:09:59.220]  Everybody segregated according to race and everything is about the hierarchical system in America is dead.
[1:09:59.220 --> 1:10:09.220]  We kill our babies. Bill Gates runs us and the Florida police are scared of the system.
[1:10:09.220 --> 1:10:15.220]  They wouldn't do that to Black Lives Matter, but they know white people and others will roll over.
[1:10:15.220 --> 1:10:20.220]  You're a white person. You're twice as likely not because there's more white people per capita per one white person.
[1:10:20.220 --> 1:10:28.220]  You're just about double the chances of being shot by the cops because the cops know white people aren't going to sue and white people aren't going to say anything.
[1:10:28.220 --> 1:10:32.220]  So what blacks actually think is they're under this huge police attack.
[1:10:32.220 --> 1:10:38.220]  No, the police slow rolling to your neighborhoods and they don't give you service and then you kill each other.
[1:10:38.220 --> 1:10:42.220]  That's why you're 10 times more likely to be killed by a black person of your black than by a white person.
[1:10:42.220 --> 1:10:46.220]  And whites are three times more likely to be killed by Hispanic than another white.
[1:10:46.220 --> 1:10:48.220]  And it just goes on from there.
[1:10:48.220 --> 1:10:51.220]  The truth is it's open season on white people and white people are dumb.
[1:10:51.220 --> 1:10:54.220]  They're lazy. They're cowardly. They're stupid.
[1:10:54.220 --> 1:10:59.220]  They grovel. They never sue. They never stand up. They bow down.
[1:10:59.220 --> 1:11:01.220]  Black people aren't what they used to be.
[1:11:01.220 --> 1:11:07.220]  And so it's open season for black people and cops and Hispanics,
[1:11:07.220 --> 1:11:12.220]  but mainly black folks to attack white people because we're known as the dodo bird.
[1:11:12.220 --> 1:11:15.220]  Dodo bird doesn't run. Dodo bird doesn't fight.
[1:11:15.220 --> 1:11:18.220]  Dodo bird doesn't do nothing but roll over and piss on itself.
[1:11:18.220 --> 1:11:22.220]  Well, here's a little news flash to everybody. I'm not a dodo bird.
[1:11:22.220 --> 1:11:24.220]  And I'm sick of it.
[1:11:24.220 --> 1:11:29.220]  But I see what's going on. I don't hate black people because they've been whipped into this. I don't hate anybody.
[1:11:29.220 --> 1:11:33.220]  But I sit there and I have the real numbers, the statistics, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:11:33.220 --> 1:11:41.220]  And those cops literally were scared of Parskills because he's like 6'9".
[1:11:41.220 --> 1:11:44.220]  And a big guy. And they were scared.
[1:11:44.220 --> 1:11:48.220]  And because there's a big guy there, they thought, well, he might start resisting.
[1:11:48.220 --> 1:11:54.220]  So let's just tackle him now, which if you had any instincts, those could have made him actually resist.
[1:11:54.220 --> 1:11:57.220]  And then you could have a problem. They're idiots. They're morons.
[1:11:57.220 --> 1:12:02.220]  They violated common sense. And those cops need to be fired. They're idiots.
[1:12:02.220 --> 1:12:06.220]  And they are what causes the problem in this country.
[1:12:06.220 --> 1:12:10.220]  But I'll tell you what else it is. Women calling the cops for no reason.
[1:12:10.220 --> 1:12:17.220]  It's well known. And it's ridiculous. And it's out of control.
[1:12:17.220 --> 1:12:21.220]  She should have just gotten the car, gone to the store. Nothing would have happened.
[1:12:21.220 --> 1:12:25.220]  Probably none of it even happened. But that's the default here, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:12:25.220 --> 1:12:29.220]  All right, toll-free number to join us. 512-646-1776 is the regular number.
[1:12:29.220 --> 1:12:34.220]  The toll-free number is 877-789. Alex, 877-789-2539.
[1:12:34.220 --> 1:12:37.220]  First-time callers, long-time callers. People that agree, disagree.
[1:12:37.220 --> 1:12:42.220]  Cops, you want to call and disagree with me, whatever. 877-789-2539.
[1:12:42.220 --> 1:12:45.220]  I'm Alex Jones. It's big day. It's debate day.
[1:12:45.220 --> 1:12:50.220]  It is September 29th, 2020. Stay with us, with us, with us, with us, with us.
[1:12:50.220 --> 1:12:57.220]  It was in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that all new cell phones would track your GPS location.
[1:12:57.220 --> 1:13:03.220]  I read from the federal law, and listeners couldn't believe me, because that was un-American.
[1:13:03.220 --> 1:13:09.220]  Now the media admits that almost every app and every company that are on Apple and on Droids,
[1:13:09.220 --> 1:13:14.220]  don't just track your location, but your surfing history, where you go, who you talk to,
[1:13:14.220 --> 1:13:20.220]  your relationships, and they all share the data with each other of what you're doing on the apps as well,
[1:13:20.220 --> 1:13:26.220]  including having apps turn on and listen to what you're saying, just like Siri or Alexa do,
[1:13:26.220 --> 1:13:32.220]  and then putting databases, transcripts of everything you say into those systems to be saved forever.
[1:13:32.220 --> 1:13:37.220]  Your phone is spying on you, and companies are generating secret surveillance scores based on information.
[1:13:37.220 --> 1:13:40.220]  This is the Global Chinese Communist Social Credit Score.
[1:13:40.220 --> 1:13:47.220]  Get your protection privacy pockets at infowarstore.com and cut Big Brother off dead in his filthy tracks.
[1:13:47.220 --> 1:13:50.220]  infowarstore.com
[1:13:50.220 --> 1:13:54.220]  The way the psychological warfare operation works is very, very simple.
[1:13:54.220 --> 1:14:00.220]  They give up freedoms by increments, always promising it's only going to be a short period of time,
[1:14:00.220 --> 1:14:05.220]  and then the restrictions will be released, but they're not.
[1:14:05.220 --> 1:14:09.220]  They have a significant amount of time, always four or five times longer than what they said.
[1:14:09.220 --> 1:14:14.220]  They will then slightly release it a little bit, only tighten it down even more later.
[1:14:14.220 --> 1:14:20.220]  This is called successive approximation, incrementalism, or the inchworm effect.
[1:14:20.220 --> 1:14:26.220]  This is the most common way that the vegetarians take over, but there then becomes a point where the public wakes up.
[1:14:26.220 --> 1:14:32.220]  Under the incrementalism, it starts resisting, and then there's usually a giant purge and a clamp down,
[1:14:32.220 --> 1:14:38.220]  and you'll see more tyranny rolled out in just a few days, weeks, or months that you saw in the previous ten years.
[1:14:38.220 --> 1:14:41.220]  And that's the period we're in globally right now.
[1:14:41.220 --> 1:14:46.220]  A world government, shy combat, globalist corporate takeover of the planet
[1:14:46.220 --> 1:14:50.220]  that wants you poor and absolutely sick under their thumb forever.
[1:15:16.220 --> 1:15:41.220]  The forces of the New World Order want control of human society. They are criminals.
[1:15:41.220 --> 1:15:49.220]  They are now forging the police departments into agents of force inoculation, secret arrest, and absolute tyranny.
[1:15:49.220 --> 1:15:57.220]  Tonight's the night. Exclusive live coverage of the first Trump-Biden presidential debate that's now live at infowars.com for its last show.
[1:15:57.220 --> 1:16:06.220]  And tonight, we're going to be commercial free right through until a few hours after the debate ends,
[1:16:06.220 --> 1:16:09.220]  taking your calls, having special guests, you name it.
[1:16:09.220 --> 1:16:15.220]  The debate actually happens at 8 p.m. tonight. Again, I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[1:16:15.220 --> 1:16:20.220]  And remember, big tech hates it when you share those links. They hate it when you override their censorship.
[1:16:20.220 --> 1:16:28.220]  It's not just part of the victory. It's all the victory is to warn people so they get the big picture and understand what's really going on.
[1:16:28.220 --> 1:16:34.220]  We got Roberto. We got Jeff. We got Lucy. We got Robert. We got Bailey.
[1:16:34.220 --> 1:16:43.220]  Or Baldy, Leo, Frank, and many, many others. Let's go to Lucy in Wales, United Kingdom. Lucy, thank you for calling.
[1:16:43.220 --> 1:16:59.220]  Taking my call. I'm in a state of absolute despair after seeing Tobias Alwood and his speech using wanting to use the army to mass vaccinate everybody.
[1:16:59.220 --> 1:17:07.220]  There is so much anger in Britain right now with the tyrannical government that we are now under.
[1:17:07.220 --> 1:17:12.220]  I voted for Boris Johnson. I sincerely regret it.
[1:17:12.220 --> 1:17:18.220]  Well, so does Nigel Farage. I mean, he certainly turned on the British people and we know why he did.
[1:17:18.220 --> 1:17:26.220]  We have the report that Chinese government put massive pressure on him through thousands of bots triggering millions of emails and fake messages.
[1:17:26.220 --> 1:17:32.220]  It worked on the governor of Texas and it's also worked on others. These guys are not sophisticated.
[1:17:32.220 --> 1:17:42.220]  Boris Johnson is an idiot. So is the governor of Texas. We have the reports with the Chinese targeted them with sock puppets, people that look like Texans, people that look like members of the UK.
[1:17:42.220 --> 1:17:47.220]  And it's not. It's pretty disgusting.
[1:17:47.220 --> 1:17:59.220]  We are under medical tyranny at this point and people are getting angrier and angrier. I mean, you saw the police brutality at Trafalgar Square on Saturday.
[1:17:59.220 --> 1:18:08.220]  I'm in touch with a solicitor who has sent a complaint to the Met. It's the legal documents.
[1:18:08.220 --> 1:18:21.220]  I mean, the way they treated that grandmother was absolutely disgusting. Prior to the event, Piers Morgan, the organiser, had had meetings with the Met.
[1:18:21.220 --> 1:18:29.220]  You know, there were marshals there. It was all peaceful until these thugs came in. It's absolutely disgusting.
[1:18:29.220 --> 1:18:42.220]  And there's another march planned now on the 26th of October and it's going to be bigger than ever. There's going to be absolute uprising on the streets of Britain very soon.
[1:18:42.220 --> 1:18:43.220]  People are sick of it.
[1:18:43.220 --> 1:18:49.220]  Well, I know I'm not trying to get in trouble, but if I saw a cop hit at one with the Billy Club, I'm going to break his ribs.
[1:18:49.220 --> 1:18:55.220]  I'm going to beat some ass. I mean, I can't take this anymore. I don't know about you. I'm not trying to shoot my mouth off, but my body is telling me it's wartime.
[1:18:55.220 --> 1:19:02.220]  And it's not because they're cops. It's because they represent the UN and forced inoculation and total tyranny. These police are idiots.
[1:19:02.220 --> 1:19:14.220]  Absolutely. People have had enough. I spent the whole day yesterday sending out Tobias Orwood's video, being a bit of an activist yesterday.
[1:19:14.220 --> 1:19:24.220]  And believe me, people in Britain are coming together and we are at breaking point. We have had enough of this tyranny.
[1:19:24.220 --> 1:19:33.220]  I know I'm at a breaking point. My wife is ready for war. I mean, you know, when your wife starts getting pissed, the women I know are starting to get pissed.
[1:19:33.220 --> 1:19:37.220]  What are you seeing there in the UK? Who's getting the most angry?
[1:19:37.220 --> 1:19:45.220]  Women, to be honest. We, because obviously we worry about our children's future. They have no future at the moment.
[1:19:45.220 --> 1:19:49.220]  Businesses are closing. Going bankrupt.
[1:19:49.220 --> 1:19:57.220]  Oh, this is economic warfare run by the Davos group bragging that they're doing it to take over. The damn criminals brag about it.
[1:19:57.220 --> 1:20:07.220]  I mean, the county where I live, we're into lockdown from 6pm yesterday. It's ridiculous. We've had enough.
[1:20:07.220 --> 1:20:13.220]  That's how they're doing it is they do it region by region. That's how the UN runs it because they know they can't get your central government totally under control.
[1:20:13.220 --> 1:20:20.220]  The local government, despicable, dangerous, disgusting. But I see a major backlash to this. I see a major backlash.
[1:20:20.220 --> 1:20:26.220]  Everybody has to go around to all the businesses and say, do not take part in the contact tracing, stop the virtue signaling right now.
[1:20:26.220 --> 1:20:33.220]  And I'm sorry, businesses that go along with the tyranny, if there's a big enough uprising, I mean, I'm sorry.
[1:20:33.220 --> 1:20:38.220]  We're not going to, we don't want to use anti-futactics, but they want to start forced inoculations and all this stuff.
[1:20:38.220 --> 1:20:41.220]  Before we start killing people, we're going to start burning things.
[1:20:41.220 --> 1:20:49.220]  It's exactly what's going to happen, I'm afraid. And, you know, this mass vaccination goes against the Nuremberg Code.
[1:20:49.220 --> 1:21:00.220]  I mean, Matt Hancock, I mean, he's got shares in Port and Farmer, Valence, Glasgow, Daxos, Smith, Klein, Beecham.
[1:21:00.220 --> 1:21:02.220]  These are all new world order puppets.
[1:21:02.220 --> 1:21:08.220]  These are criminal conflict of interest. And then they admit these vaccines are all deadly. What does that tell you?
[1:21:08.220 --> 1:21:14.220]  They're telling you up front, this is going to hurt you because they have to metaphysically tell you that. That is scary.
[1:21:14.220 --> 1:21:20.220]  It is. It's quite then. It's worse than any nightmare it really is.
[1:21:20.220 --> 1:21:26.220]  And we're living it now. I mean, you know, it's not incremental anymore. It's here.
[1:21:26.220 --> 1:21:36.220]  Well, think about that. They're coming with a protected vaccine that changes your DNA that they admit makes you really sick for something Fauci and Gates paid for in a lab on record.
[1:21:36.220 --> 1:21:41.220]  And they've locked us down and it's a power grab and they admitted it is. And then they're going to put it in our body.
[1:21:41.220 --> 1:21:47.220]  They're coming to assault us. What do they think we're going to do? We cannot put up with being assaulted.
[1:21:47.220 --> 1:21:56.220]  We will fight back. I mean, there's so many people I'm in touch with on social media and everything else.
[1:21:56.220 --> 1:22:02.220]  And believe me, it's we're starting to rise up and people have had enough.
[1:22:02.220 --> 1:22:06.220]  I wonder if Tobias L. Wood knows he's crossed the Rubicon.
[1:22:06.220 --> 1:22:15.220]  Oh, judging by the amount of treats he's been sent. Yes. Oh, he knows.
[1:22:15.220 --> 1:22:20.220]  He won't be able to walk down the street if he carries this out.
[1:22:20.220 --> 1:22:23.220]  Well, he's not going to be walking. I don't think I don't want any violence, but he's coming with it.
[1:22:23.220 --> 1:22:29.220]  He's coming with a deadly Bill Gates vaccine. I mean, we're telling him we're like, stop it. Stop it.
[1:22:29.220 --> 1:22:35.220]  But he won't, will he? No, he won't. And, you know, I've been following David Ike for years.
[1:22:35.220 --> 1:22:43.220]  I saw him live a couple of years ago and, you know, he's just found out exactly what their agenda is.
[1:22:43.220 --> 1:22:50.220]  And, you know, he's no longer a conspiracy theorist. Is he? He's right.
[1:22:50.220 --> 1:22:55.220]  It's because it's all admitted. It's all admitted. That's that's how David could come out with something the same day as I do.
[1:22:55.220 --> 1:22:59.220]  And we say the exact same thing because it's the same thing we're looking at. This is the reality.
[1:22:59.220 --> 1:23:07.220]  And they're working for a very small, evil group. So remember the cops, the bureaucrats, this Tobias idiot is only a frontman.
[1:23:07.220 --> 1:23:14.220]  But regardless, they want to put heat on us. They want to physically attack us. This is the two way street.
[1:23:14.220 --> 1:23:20.220]  And so they have to understand that. Well, there's more of us than there is of them.
[1:23:20.220 --> 1:23:26.220]  And the sooner they realize that, the better, because we simply will not put up with any more of this.
[1:23:26.220 --> 1:23:30.220]  I hear you. I absolutely hear you. All right. God bless you, man. Great call, Lucy.
[1:23:30.220 --> 1:23:34.220]  More calls straight ahead. Stay with us. Tell folks tuning right now. That's how you fight back peacefully.
[1:23:34.220 --> 1:23:39.220]  I don't want to have to hurt anybody. Do you try to hurt me and my family? I'm going to hurt you really bad. I promise you that.
[1:23:39.220 --> 1:23:44.220]  You globalists are going to get it. I'm talking about the leadership.
[1:23:44.220 --> 1:23:54.220]  What if you could cut your heating bills this winter with your existing wood-burning fireplace and not spend thousands doing it?
[1:23:54.220 --> 1:23:57.220]  You can with Great Wall of Fire Fireplace Grates.

[1:24:19.220 --> 1:24:23.220]  It's the evening of September 26, 2020.
[1:24:23.220 --> 1:24:41.220]  And I just got done watching the horrible footage of thousands of riot police with Trojans beating thousands of peaceful people in Trafalgar Square protesting the COVID martial law lockdown.
[1:24:41.220 --> 1:24:48.220]  An iron curtain is descending over the world from the United Nations, even more evil than the old Soviet Union.
[1:24:48.220 --> 1:25:02.220]  And this model is communist China. We're not facing incremental tyranny. We're facing absolute 100% commitment to evil, because the system thinks we're weak and thinks we're stupid and is making this move.
[1:25:02.220 --> 1:25:09.220]  And whether it's Australia, the U.K., or the U.S., Black Lives Matter funded by Soros can run around and kill cops and burn things down in their heroes.
[1:25:09.220 --> 1:25:15.220]  And oh, nobody's worried about the COVID BS, but when it's patriots saying we have rights, we have dignity, they get viciously attacked.
[1:25:15.220 --> 1:25:19.220]  All of the videos are at m4wars.com with David Ike speaking and more.
[1:25:46.220 --> 1:25:55.220]  Once they have the electronic straightjacket in place, they are on record that they will bring in forced inoculations that sterilize you and your family and worse.
[1:25:55.220 --> 1:26:04.220]  Many of the vaccines being pushed by the United Nations actually give people polio and actually give people cancer. Most cancer is viral.
[1:26:04.220 --> 1:26:11.220]  That's a big secret, but the secret is beginning to come out. It's even in the Associated Press.
[1:26:11.220 --> 1:26:20.220]  Remember, all of these banned videos and reports are banned on video, but only you can share them and save humanity.
[1:26:20.220 --> 1:26:29.220]  The Renaissance, the Great Enlightenment, it's all being swept away and being replaced by scientific tyranny.
[1:26:29.220 --> 1:26:40.220]  That's establishing a form of planetary digital law where the technocrats are above the law and the public isn't even considered to be.
[1:26:40.220 --> 1:26:47.220]  It's valuable as a cow. In fact, humans are seen as garbage that's going to be taken out and removed.
[1:26:47.220 --> 1:26:53.220]  That is the post-human extermination plan. That is the public ideology of the globalists.
[1:26:53.220 --> 1:27:02.220]  And everything they've built with this high-tech grid is to absorb us and anesthetize our minds as we're slowly killed.
[1:27:02.220 --> 1:27:10.220]  And any future generations that happen to strangle out of their mother's wounds will be a mere shadow of what humans once were.
[1:27:10.220 --> 1:27:33.220]  This is the Satanic ruling elite engaged in mass vandalism against God's creation, humanity. This is the essence of evil.
[1:27:40.220 --> 1:27:47.220]  Fight Night, Debate Night, September 29, 2020 on this Tuesday, Global Edition.
[1:27:47.220 --> 1:27:56.220]  34 days out from the election. I am your host, Alex Jones. We're taking your phone calls from around the world right now.
[1:27:56.220 --> 1:28:01.220]  But let me give you a secret sauce here. And I think you already know this. That's why you tune in.
[1:28:01.220 --> 1:28:06.220]  I just validate what you already understand. You had a few cents. I had a few cents.
[1:28:06.220 --> 1:28:11.220]  What was happening before the COVID-19 lockdown? Nationalist governments were getting elected.
[1:28:11.220 --> 1:28:17.220]  Populism was happening. Productivity was coming back. Christianity was coming back. The family was coming back.
[1:28:17.220 --> 1:28:21.220]  A lot of good things were happening. The GMOs were being exposed. The dangerous vaccines were being exposed.
[1:28:21.220 --> 1:28:26.220]  The head of the UN vaccine program said we're hurting people. We're told to give these with no testing.
[1:28:26.220 --> 1:28:38.220]  Their system was collapsing. And so they failed forward, putting us into the global lockdown to consolidate power and control, lock us in our houses, play us off against each other and change the subject.
[1:28:38.220 --> 1:28:43.220]  They then, from Australia to the United States of the China, came out and said they're helping fund Black Lives Matter.
[1:28:43.220 --> 1:28:49.220]  That broke two days ago that the Chinese government's funding Black Lives Matter. Of course they are.
[1:28:49.220 --> 1:28:54.220]  They airbrush black people out of Star Wars movies that air in China.
[1:28:54.220 --> 1:29:08.220]  China is the most anti-Black country on Earth. I'm just saying, it's funny they're colonizing and taking over Africa because I'm not going to repeat in Chinese what the Chinese say about Black people, but I don't agree with it.
[1:29:08.220 --> 1:29:14.220]  I'll just leave it at that. But that's what's going on here, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:29:14.220 --> 1:29:28.220]  And it's huge news. It's huge information. But the good news is the New World Order is having to launch all of this because of the global awakening.
[1:29:28.220 --> 1:29:35.220]  So as bad as this is, they were already planning this. They were already gearing it up. They were already doing stuff like this in the third world to people that were defenseless.
[1:29:35.220 --> 1:29:43.220]  And so now people aren't going to be able to live on the fence anymore and live in La La Land. And a lot of folks are going to join it. And a lot of folks are going to fight it.
[1:29:43.220 --> 1:29:54.220]  And you know, I've been on there 26 years. I don't get up here and talk about violence. But when they're coming to put things in us and attack us and they admit it's going to hurt us and the military is going to do it.
[1:29:54.220 --> 1:30:08.220]  Well, they praise people shooting cops. But if you try to have a prayer meeting, you get arrested by the cops. They love the cops arresting you for praying, but they hate the cops when they try to stop them burning down the police station.
[1:30:08.220 --> 1:30:18.220]  And so I'm not talking about the cops. I'm talking about the system ordering the cops around. Those giving the orders to assault us with vaccines. I don't want any offensive attacks. I'm not going to go out and burn anything down.
[1:30:18.220 --> 1:30:30.220]  I'm not going to shoot anybody. I'm saying they coerce you to give your kid a shot and they have a convulsion and die. They murdered your child. The courts aren't going to punish him. What are you going to do about it?
[1:30:30.220 --> 1:30:41.220]  It's coming down to an eye for an eye, two is for a tooth like it's always been. And these people have gotten away with this for so long, they think they're above the law. Do you feel lucky punk will do you?
[1:30:41.220 --> 1:30:55.220]  And they've taken our restraint as President Trump has said for weakness, ladies and gentlemen. They've taken our restraint as weakness and it's time to let them know.
[1:30:55.220 --> 1:31:09.220]  Unequivocally, we're going to stop submitting. But they know you stop submitting. The UK passed Brexit to get out of the UN, to get out of the EU. They never signed on to be part of the EU.
[1:31:09.220 --> 1:31:23.220]  And then they called everybody racist and said England existing is bad and white people are inherently evil. They tried to bring in unlimited Islamic groups to start a war and they let them run child kidnapping rings.
[1:31:23.220 --> 1:31:39.220]  And they had a landslide to get Boris Johnson in who then turned against him again. That'll just make more people wake up until they finally get somebody like Nigel Farage, who I can tell you is very close to running for Prime Minister.
[1:31:39.220 --> 1:31:43.220]  He's got to get back into Parliament to do it.
[1:31:43.220 --> 1:31:47.220]  So that's where they are, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:31:47.220 --> 1:31:54.220]  We're in a fight. The good news is we're in a fight. We're not taking it lying down. We're not getting our asses kicked either. We're giving a lot more than we're getting.
[1:31:54.220 --> 1:32:03.220]  And so as long as everybody knows the lockdown come to you from the globalist, the pedophilia comes to you from the globalist, the Satanism from them. They're the problem. They're the stench.
[1:32:03.220 --> 1:32:12.220]  They're the dead cat in the attic that smells up the house. They're the problem. They're the hemorrhoid.
[1:32:12.220 --> 1:32:25.220]  They're the wart. They're the cancer. They're the blemish. They're the bad gas. They're the rotten food. They're the problem. They're the bad guys. They're the scum.
[1:32:25.220 --> 1:32:35.220]  And scum got away with evil so long. A lot of other people said, well, I'll join the scum. And that's why it created the illusion that the scum is going to win forever. It's not going to win forever.
[1:32:35.220 --> 1:32:44.220]  We're going to shake them off our back like a bunch of fleas they are.
[1:32:44.220 --> 1:32:54.220]  I mean, you look at the trash that leads the New World Order. They're losers. They've always been losers. They will be defeated. All right, let's go to some phone calls.
[1:32:54.220 --> 1:33:02.220]  I guess up next would be Roberto in Minnesota. Up there where Ilhan Omar is openly trying to steal the election. Go ahead, Roberto.
[1:33:02.220 --> 1:33:05.220]  Yes, sir. Thank you for taking my call. It's great to speak to you, Mr. Jones.
[1:33:05.220 --> 1:33:07.220]  Thanks for talking to you, sir. What's on your mind?
[1:33:07.220 --> 1:33:16.220]  Well, my call is about all the Ilhan Omar stuff, the Project Barotops video that's going on. There's early voting going on in Minnesota.
[1:33:16.220 --> 1:33:20.220]  And I just recently became a U.S. citizen. I am very happy to vote in my first election.
[1:33:20.220 --> 1:33:27.220]  But now with everything that's going on, we don't know if our votes are even going to be counted.
[1:33:27.220 --> 1:33:31.220]  Oh, they admit Ilhan Omar's people run all the major precincts in Minneapolis, St. Paul.
[1:33:31.220 --> 1:33:41.220]  Yes, sir. Yes, sir. And we don't know. We feel powerless here. These people are acting like they're untouchable.
[1:33:41.220 --> 1:33:42.220]  We don't know what to do.
[1:33:42.220 --> 1:33:49.220]  Well, I'll hand it to the Somali community from what Veritas says. A lot of them are really pissed about this. They actually want to be able to vote.
[1:33:49.220 --> 1:34:00.220]  That's right. There's a lot of talk in Minnesota going on where people want to vote how they want to vote, but they're voting how they're being told to vote.
[1:34:00.220 --> 1:34:07.220]  And it's just, it's very demoralizing here in Minnesota, sir, especially at the epicenter of everything.
[1:34:07.220 --> 1:34:13.220]  I agree. Where do you think this is going to go? Ilhan seems more arrogant than ever.
[1:34:13.220 --> 1:34:20.220]  The optimist in me says that, you know, justice will come for her and she'll be led away in handcuffs.
[1:34:20.220 --> 1:34:26.220]  But the realist in me thinks nothing's going to happen, especially here in Minnesota.
[1:34:26.220 --> 1:34:34.220]  Man, when you look at Chuck E. Schumer, he looks evil. When you look at Ryan Stelter, he looks evil. Ilhan Omar just sieves like a villain.
[1:34:34.220 --> 1:34:38.220]  Like a Sith Lord or something. He just sieves evil.
[1:34:38.220 --> 1:34:43.220]  I'm looking at other Somalis. I don't see that evil look on their face. I mean, she just looks like an evil person.
[1:34:43.220 --> 1:34:48.220]  And then her actions fit the cover, you know? She just is a seething little demon.
[1:34:48.220 --> 1:34:56.220]  Absolutely, sir. It's a smugness that's going on and everybody can see it. You just can't talk about it.
[1:34:56.220 --> 1:34:58.220]  God bless you, brother. I appreciate you.
[1:34:58.220 --> 1:35:03.220]  Well, the globalists aren't going to be so smug when Trump wins again like four years ago.
[1:35:03.220 --> 1:35:06.220]  They're not going to be so smug when we arrest all the pedophiles. This is now happening.
[1:35:06.220 --> 1:35:12.220]  They're not going to be so smug when they're swinging from the end of a damn rope.
[1:35:12.220 --> 1:35:16.220]  And I don't have a vengeful feeling like where I want to hurt these people myself.
[1:35:16.220 --> 1:35:24.220]  But I do want justice for the children and justice and a feeling of satisfaction.
[1:35:24.220 --> 1:35:33.220]  The satisfaction is sending these people to hell politically in a peaceful, nonviolent manner.
[1:35:33.220 --> 1:35:38.220]  Let's jam another call before we go to break. Let's go to Gabe in Michigan. Gabe, thanks for calling.
[1:35:38.220 --> 1:35:40.220]  How are you doing today, Alex?
[1:35:40.220 --> 1:35:44.220]  Man, it's just all come true. Worse than I thought. It's all here. We're just inside the New World Order now.
[1:35:44.220 --> 1:35:47.220]  They're just shutting everything down as we go. They'll know how long we'll be on air, brother.
[1:35:47.220 --> 1:35:53.220]  I actually want to tell you it's a pleasure listening to you and then Owen and the other staff all day long.
[1:35:53.220 --> 1:35:57.220]  I had a couple of things. I've been in and out of the hospital for the past three months.
[1:35:57.220 --> 1:36:03.220]  I've been to four different hospitals up here in Michigan and they're all telling me that there's no COVID patients.
[1:36:03.220 --> 1:36:11.220]  They haven't had COVID patients. You can't even get in from the emergency room because everybody and their brother is trying to get in now.
[1:36:11.220 --> 1:36:16.220]  Yeah, because all the regular things are shut. Exactly. All the regular ones are shut down.
[1:36:16.220 --> 1:36:22.220]  I've got family that are nurses and doctors and they say, what I said six months ago, they're drinking vodka and having sex.
[1:36:22.220 --> 1:36:24.220]  They're totally closed. They're empty.
[1:36:24.220 --> 1:36:33.220]  But what makes me even more sick is to see the people, our brother and over in England, there's a few dozen cops out there
[1:36:33.220 --> 1:36:39.220]  and they're beating tens of thousands of people back. It's time to stop these cops down.
[1:36:39.220 --> 1:36:43.220]  If they're not on our side, they're against us and we need to start.
[1:36:43.220 --> 1:36:50.220]  Enough words, enough being conservative and nice. It's time to show our force because these people are nothing but police.
[1:36:50.220 --> 1:36:56.220]  Well, notice, I mean, look, look, look, leftist police forces. Stay there. I'll come back to you Gabe. Don't hang up. This is important.
[1:36:56.220 --> 1:37:02.220]  When you have a leftist police force, the police become agents of evil.
[1:37:02.220 --> 1:37:06.220]  When you have a good nationalistic patriotic by the book cops, they're not bad.
[1:37:06.220 --> 1:37:09.220]  Whenever the Democrats run the police force, they're bad.
[1:37:09.220 --> 1:37:12.220]  Look at the cops that attack Pars kill. They're liberals, man.
[1:37:12.220 --> 1:37:18.220]  I mean, they're bad people. I mean, you just can't really debate it.
[1:37:18.220 --> 1:37:25.220]  We've now entered month number eight of the global lockdown and it's horrible and it's killing millions of people via starvation.
[1:37:25.220 --> 1:37:30.220]  But the good news is it's caused a planetary awakening as well.
[1:37:30.220 --> 1:37:36.220]  The general public all over the planet hate Bill Gates. He's the most unpopular person on earth.
[1:37:36.220 --> 1:37:40.220]  People know he's not a doctor. People know he's a eugenicist.
[1:37:40.220 --> 1:37:47.220]  The population knows that his vaccines that he pushes have been filled with cancer viruses, polio, sterile and more.
[1:37:47.220 --> 1:37:49.220]  It's even in the Associated Press.
[1:37:49.220 --> 1:37:56.220]  So now they're beginning to understand that we the people know that there is a corporate global government.
[1:37:56.220 --> 1:38:04.220]  And the beast top tech billionaires sit in meetings and decide to pull the type of race war scams and coronavirus scams that we're witnessing.
[1:38:04.220 --> 1:38:10.220]  So remember that and let them know that we know who they are and what they've done.
[1:38:10.220 --> 1:38:13.220]  And we hold them responsible for the collapse of civilization.
[1:38:13.220 --> 1:38:18.220]  They are the enemies of humanity. They want you dead.
[1:38:18.220 --> 1:38:23.220]  The globalists are very, very honest about their planetary goals.
[1:38:23.220 --> 1:38:32.220]  They want private corporate governance above nation states, above religious institutions, above the family.
[1:38:32.220 --> 1:38:35.220]  They want total corporate power.
[1:38:35.220 --> 1:38:40.220]  There was a great film back in the early 1970s called Rollerball with James Cahn.
[1:38:40.220 --> 1:38:44.220]  It's based on a novel set in the year 2020.
[1:38:44.220 --> 1:38:51.220]  And in the book you have megacorporates that control the planet and there are no longer nation states.
[1:38:51.220 --> 1:38:56.220]  There are only cities that are the capitals of the corporations.
[1:38:56.220 --> 1:39:03.220]  If you actually read what the Deimos group of the CFR and the Rural Commission say in the year 2020, that is their end game.
[1:39:03.220 --> 1:39:04.220]  That is their goal.
[1:39:04.220 --> 1:39:12.220]  So we're talking about a hunger games type scenario here run by very, very, very ruthless people to see us as shadow.
[1:39:12.220 --> 1:39:16.220]  They're using COVID-19 as their takeover strategy and communist China as their model.
[1:39:16.220 --> 1:39:19.220]  We must reject it now.
[1:39:19.220 --> 1:39:27.220]  Hello, my name is Dr. Fauci and I've been at the NIH and CDC for 45 years.
[1:39:27.220 --> 1:39:32.220]  I've overseen well, you know, the AIDS pandemic and so many other things.
[1:39:32.220 --> 1:39:37.220]  And I take my orders from Bill Gates, Dr. Bill Gates.
[1:39:37.220 --> 1:39:42.220]  I mean, he's not a doctor, but he controls everything you do.
[1:39:42.220 --> 1:39:52.220]  And he now says you're going to take the shots. And of course, in England, they are now saying what I told you, you will not be allowed to travel.
[1:39:52.220 --> 1:39:55.220]  Leave your home until you take all the shots.
[1:39:55.220 --> 1:40:07.220]  Dr. Gates, I mean Bill Gates, your owner, your master says you will have to take four to five COVID shots a year for adult to for baby.
[1:40:07.220 --> 1:40:14.220]  Baby, much more manageable, just like Bill Gates give you polio and vaccine.
[1:40:14.220 --> 1:40:19.220]  I'm Dr. Fauci, reminding you that we owe you.
[1:40:19.220 --> 1:40:26.220]  If you look at the top tech billionaires and the big banks that finance and control them to a man and to a woman,
[1:40:26.220 --> 1:40:32.220]  they believe there's too many people on the earth and they constantly whine about when they want to go to a mountain top or a national park,
[1:40:32.220 --> 1:40:37.220]  they have to look at us, the common people, they have to look at the proletariat, they have to look at the scum.
[1:40:37.220 --> 1:40:44.220]  That's why they love the lockdown, putting muzzles on us, that gives them a big thrill, controlling where we can go, what we can do.
[1:40:44.220 --> 1:40:51.220]  Bankrupting Main Street, bankrupting small towns, all of it is a vertical integration, consolidation,
[1:40:51.220 --> 1:40:57.220]  so they can then dictate the terms of our total surrender, which is taking sterilant vaccines day one.
[1:40:57.220 --> 1:41:04.220]  Ladies and gentlemen, all the games are over, playtime's over, they used all the entertainment and garbage to put us into a trance,
[1:41:04.220 --> 1:41:07.220]  and now the spider's moving in for the kill.
[1:41:07.220 --> 1:41:12.220]  You know this, I know this, it's all out in the open, the question is what are we going to do about it?
[1:41:12.220 --> 1:41:38.220]  Well the first thing is identify the enemy, identify the enemy, identify the enemy, identify your enemy now.
[1:41:38.220 --> 1:41:44.220]  One way or another, we're going to get you a new world order, your control freak system's going down.
[1:41:44.220 --> 1:41:51.220]  Remember just ten years ago, nobody knew about global government, new world order, eugenics, forced inoculations, the planetary depopulation plan.
[1:41:51.220 --> 1:41:56.220]  Now it's mainline, and Bill Gates is the most hated person on the planet.
[1:41:56.220 --> 1:42:00.220]  But look, I'm going to go back to your calls right now, I just want you to understand something.
[1:42:00.220 --> 1:42:08.220]  They are collapsing the economy to bring in a depression, to dictate what we've got to do to get a job or get food rations,
[1:42:08.220 --> 1:42:14.220]  and already the third world's got millions that have starved to death, over two million, eight million the UN estimates are going to die by the end of the year.
[1:42:14.220 --> 1:42:20.220]  I think it's a very conservative number, they engineer it, they've got the numbers, they're now seeing two hundred and something million.
[1:42:20.220 --> 1:42:25.220]  This weekend I was putting an old number, they were seeing one hundred and thirty five million, head of the UN food program were set to starve to death,
[1:42:25.220 --> 1:42:34.220]  a couple years from this, and we were search engineering it, and there was the UN now seeing last week two hundred and thirty five million, two hundred and thirty eight million.
[1:42:34.220 --> 1:42:39.220]  So that's in the report we shot this weekend when I had a drone go downtown and fly over the park and warn the public.
[1:42:39.220 --> 1:42:46.220]  A lot of folks agreed with it, and other folks told me F off that I was a racist, because I didn't want to starve Africans to death.
[1:42:46.220 --> 1:42:50.220]  I actually had white women tell me that, so that's the upside down world they're in.
[1:42:50.220 --> 1:42:56.220]  But before we go to your calls separately, we have a lot of complaints, and that doesn't happen very often.
[1:42:56.220 --> 1:43:01.220]  People saying, hey, we know you already have the lowest prices on high quality storeable food in FullWarsTour.com.
[1:43:01.220 --> 1:43:06.220]  They have three months, six months, year, two year food supplies, they've got all these other items.
[1:43:06.220 --> 1:43:14.220]  The special you've got to prepare with Alex.com is just three items, an air filter, a water filter, and a three month supply that had big discounts on them,
[1:43:14.220 --> 1:43:24.220]  but we want bigger packages. So that special ended, they kept one of the sales, and they added all these new ones at preparewithalax.com.
[1:43:24.220 --> 1:43:32.220]  So we've got one hundred and fifty dollars off the three month food supply, super high quality, you're not going to find a better, again, storeable food for that price.
[1:43:32.220 --> 1:43:39.220]  Three hundred dollars off, this is the new part of it, three hundred dollars off the six month food supply.
[1:43:39.220 --> 1:43:46.220]  And again, they don't raise prices and then lower them. They always have the same price. So this is very rare. I asked them to do this because we're their biggest seller.
[1:43:46.220 --> 1:43:52.220]  They've got a lot of other distributors that are pissed off about this, but sorry, they're not in the fight like we are, they're not the tip of the spear.
[1:43:52.220 --> 1:43:59.220]  So we've got the best deal. Three hundred dollars off the six month food supply, six hundred dollars off the one year food supply,
[1:43:59.220 --> 1:44:11.220]  forty dollars off the Alexa pure water filtration system, pitcher system, twenty five dollars off the ready hour wireless solar power bank charger and twenty eight LED room like that is an amazing deal.
[1:44:11.220 --> 1:44:19.220]  You cannot find a better deal period on the full line of my Patriot supply, then you're going to find it in four store dot com.
[1:44:19.220 --> 1:44:27.220]  But if you want an even bigger discount, they can do it with these limited things, the six month, the one year and more.
[1:44:27.220 --> 1:44:35.220]  So prepare with Alex dot com or call toll free triple eight four one one zero three five zero triple eight four one one zero three five zero.
[1:44:35.220 --> 1:44:42.220]  I want to thank you all for your support. But with all the stuff coming down and the craziness, they're ready to ship down like a week folks.
[1:44:42.220 --> 1:44:51.220]  Other places are sold out or have really high prices. You need to get this check box taken care of and it funds the info or which is a 360 win.
[1:44:51.220 --> 1:44:57.220]  But there was sawdust in these things. You'd be fun in the info or be worth it, but it's not. It's high quality, durable food that last twenty five years.
[1:44:57.220 --> 1:45:00.220]  That is insurance you can eat. I would take action right now.
[1:45:00.220 --> 1:45:06.220]  And then separately, you know, I'm not at liberty. There's a lot of strategic reasons.
[1:45:06.220 --> 1:45:12.220]  I can't tell you everything that's going on behind the scenes and people call up crew members that work here and they go, tell us what's going on.
[1:45:12.220 --> 1:45:18.220]  Or family members go, you know, I hear Alex saying that Info Wars is in trouble and this could be our last months on air.
[1:45:18.220 --> 1:45:24.220]  You know, is Info Wars in trouble? Yeah, we're in a lot of trouble, folks. We're in deep trouble. Okay.
[1:45:24.220 --> 1:45:29.220]  Real trouble. If I told you all of it, you just, you wouldn't believe it. Okay. I really want to tell you.
[1:45:29.220 --> 1:45:35.220]  I mean, what I told you they kidnapped my kids. Oh, sorry. Sorry. Let's just stop right there.
[1:45:35.220 --> 1:45:39.220]  Just believe me. You don't know the amount of trouble you're in. Okay.
[1:45:39.220 --> 1:45:44.220]  Because here's the newsflash. You're in trouble. You're in trouble. We're in a lot of trouble, people.
[1:45:44.220 --> 1:45:49.220]  And I kind of get this normalcy bias where I sit up here for years watching it get worse. I'm like the fraud in the pot.
[1:45:49.220 --> 1:45:56.220]  It's boiling. I'm done, folks. Okay. It's bad. And I know what's going on with supply chains. I know what's going on with Trump.
[1:45:56.220 --> 1:46:00.220]  I know what the real stuff that's going on. Okay. It ain't all roses like you hear.
[1:46:00.220 --> 1:46:05.220]  Remember Durham never indicted anybody. And now he's not indicted anybody. I told you he isn't.
[1:46:05.220 --> 1:46:12.220]  It's the other way around. They got thousands of Trump supporters with the indictments ready.
[1:46:12.220 --> 1:46:19.220]  That's why all the delusional stuff pisses me off. Because we're going to win if we know how bad the enemy is when we get the word out.
[1:46:19.220 --> 1:46:25.220]  But we all just sit back and while I heard, you know, the Navy SEAL saved all the kids in underground tunnels and everything's fine.
[1:46:25.220 --> 1:46:34.220]  That's 4chan crap.
[1:46:34.220 --> 1:46:41.220]  This is a real world, folks. And Trump needs your prayers. This is very close. This is very dangerous.
[1:46:41.220 --> 1:46:45.220]  You don't want to wake up when Trump assassinated. Or they'll say he died of a stroke.
[1:46:45.220 --> 1:46:49.220]  Or you don't want to wake up with the dollars dead and the stock market's gone down 15,000 points.
[1:46:49.220 --> 1:46:53.220]  You're like, but I thought everything was handled. No, you're going to have to get aggressive.
[1:46:53.220 --> 1:46:59.220]  You're going to have to get engaged. So if you want to get supplements or a t-shirt or a book or anything, I believe we'll still be on air in six months.
[1:46:59.220 --> 1:47:04.220]  But this is the greatest danger. The whole country, the whole economy, the whole thing's ever been in.
[1:47:04.220 --> 1:47:11.220]  And again, man, I talked to the White House. I talked to Trump's lawyers. I talked to the president. I talked to the military.
[1:47:11.220 --> 1:47:18.220]  They asked me what's going on. I asked them what's going on. There is no upper ceiling. I've gone above the clouds. I'm up there, okay?
[1:47:18.220 --> 1:47:24.220]  And they don't know what's going on. It's all a total war with good versus evil.
[1:47:24.220 --> 1:47:33.220]  And it's bad. Yeah, we're arresting them. They're in trouble. Their system's in trouble. This is a real fight. We're actually winning.
[1:47:33.220 --> 1:47:40.220]  But people need to know how deadly serious it is. So while you still can, all of this is in stock right now.

[1:48:21.220 --> 1:48:26.220]  And it goes on and on and on and on. I'd get to the X2 and the X3 if you're getting anything in FortWareStore.com.
[1:48:26.220 --> 1:48:30.220]  Okay, I'm going to shut up. Go to your calls. Gabe, finishing up.
[1:48:30.220 --> 1:48:32.220]  Yeah, I'm here.
[1:48:32.220 --> 1:48:39.220]  Yeah, I mean, they want a physical war because we're culturally still winning. But at the same point, when they come to force, they'll be inoculate us.
[1:48:39.220 --> 1:48:47.220]  Or they do all this. Yeah, the minions of the system need to learn to fear the people. Like Thomas Jefferson said, when the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[1:48:47.220 --> 1:48:53.220]  When the people fear the government, there is tyranny. Well, the commies want the police to fear them, so they'll come attack us.
[1:48:53.220 --> 1:48:58.220]  And a lot of cops are following that. Did you see in LA where they were dragging people out of their cars and bashing their windows out?
[1:48:58.220 --> 1:49:04.220]  And the cops would arrest the people that the mob was attacking trying to virtue signal? That's disgusting.
[1:49:04.220 --> 1:49:12.220]  Yeah, it's sickening. I'm telling you, me, I'm ready. I've talked to my friends. They're ready. I use a walker right now to get around.
[1:49:12.220 --> 1:49:21.220]  If I have to take my walker to the front line or wheel myself up in a wheelchair, I don't care. I'm ready to put myself and my life on the line for my kids.
[1:49:21.220 --> 1:49:23.220]  So they're not force vaccinated.
[1:49:23.220 --> 1:49:28.220]  Brother, you can do a lot if we go to a physical war from a hedgerow with your walker.
[1:49:28.220 --> 1:49:36.220]  Then nobody's going to show up at my doorstep to force vaccinate us. You will not leave my house alive. It's not going to happen.
[1:49:36.220 --> 1:49:43.220]  I don't want my kids growing up with the Pelosi's, the water, the vaccine waters of the world. They deserve a better future than that.
[1:49:43.220 --> 1:49:50.220]  No, no, I can feel it. I've never, I've never been in the... Look, here's what's going to happen.
[1:49:50.220 --> 1:49:57.220]  Don't wait till... And I want to say go on to something violent. If somebody tries to come in and isolate your door, who's in charge of that?
[1:49:57.220 --> 1:50:02.220]  Who's the politician? Who's the globalist? That's who has to pay. Not the idiot coming to your door. God bless you.
[1:50:02.220 --> 1:50:13.220]  All I'm saying is it doesn't do anything to the dumb idiots, the dumb down people. It's the enemy controllers.
[1:50:13.220 --> 1:50:19.220]  And we don't want to do anything to them. They're starting to fight because we're winning peacefully.
[1:50:19.220 --> 1:50:25.220]  But I'm saying it goes hot. It goes red. You want to tear out their command and control, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:50:25.220 --> 1:50:34.220]  That's what you want to go after. Oh my God. Let's go ahead and take another call here. Let's jam in one more.
[1:50:34.220 --> 1:50:37.220]  Leo in Minnesota, go ahead. You're on the air.
[1:50:37.220 --> 1:50:39.220]  Alex, what's going on, brother?
[1:50:39.220 --> 1:50:42.220]  Man, I'm getting freaked out. It's all coming down, brother.
[1:50:42.220 --> 1:50:50.220]  I know that's right. Look, man, I'm a Minnesota proud boy and I tell you what, a war is going to happen. It's just a matter of when.
[1:50:50.220 --> 1:50:57.220]  And with this presidential debate going on tonight and the narrative going to be all about Trump after he destroys Biden,
[1:50:57.220 --> 1:51:03.220]  a false flag is imminent before this election. And everybody needs to keep their head on a swivel.
[1:51:03.220 --> 1:51:09.220]  Proud boys marched into Portland. Antifa didn't do nothing. We marched to Philly. Antifa didn't do nothing.
[1:51:09.220 --> 1:51:14.220]  They're standing down. They're trying to make the narrative that they're the good guys. They're waiting for the right to do something.
[1:51:14.220 --> 1:51:17.220]  And I'm afraid of a false flag, brother.
[1:51:17.220 --> 1:51:24.220]  I one trillion percent agree. In fact, I've been meaning this whole week to come in and say false flag imminent is the headline of the show and forgot to do it.
[1:51:24.220 --> 1:51:31.220]  They're going to blow up a black church or shoot up a black university or blow up a gay pride parade, something like that to say Trump did it.
[1:51:31.220 --> 1:51:39.220]  Back of Black Lives Matter crowd or peacefully protesting, you know, maybe they might not be into the violence yet.
[1:51:39.220 --> 1:51:42.220]  They might be during the day and, you know, a shooting happens.
[1:51:42.220 --> 1:51:48.220]  And then guess what? You don't see the shooter. But on the news, there's a video camera of a guy in a MAGA hat with a gun.
[1:51:48.220 --> 1:51:54.220]  You know, like these people, this is what they do, Alex. This is weapons grade psychological warfare.
[1:51:54.220 --> 1:51:59.220]  And being a proud boy on the front lines, I just see it get to that point.
[1:51:59.220 --> 1:52:05.220]  Hold on. Don't hang up. We all want to hear what you've witnessed from Minnesota, the home of Ilhan Omar that hates this country.
[1:52:05.220 --> 1:52:13.220]  I've come to you many times and ask for your support. And you've always come through.
[1:52:13.220 --> 1:52:19.220]  And Info Wars has come through. We've never sold out. We've never backed down. We've always told the truth.
[1:52:19.220 --> 1:52:25.220]  We've made mistakes. But 98% of the time or so, we're dead on. And the enemy knows that.
[1:52:25.220 --> 1:52:29.220]  Info Wars is a thought leader, not just here but around the world.
[1:52:29.220 --> 1:52:40.220]  And that's why the Chai comms, Hollywood, the globalist want us off the air because their global plan of total tyranny and a post human world will not succeed if we stay on air.
[1:52:40.220 --> 1:52:46.220]  If you don't support us, ladies and gentlemen, now they're going to shut Info Wars down and shut everybody else down as well.
[1:52:46.220 --> 1:52:56.220]  You already know that it's out in the open. So again, count the cost, focus and realize how critical you are with your word of mouth spreading the word that overrides the sensors.
[1:52:56.220 --> 1:53:00.220]  Your financial support getting the products at InfoWars.com and your prayer.
[1:53:00.220 --> 1:53:06.220]  I'm praying for you. Please pray for us. Let's do this together. We're going to win. We are winning, but it's not going to be easy.
[1:53:06.220 --> 1:53:30.220]  The enemy is trying to take it all from us. Let's not let them succeed.
[1:53:37.220 --> 1:53:45.220]  Then the UN put out standardized rules designed to keep the West locked down when China reopened within three months.
[1:53:45.220 --> 1:53:56.220]  This is the greatest strategic coup ever. This is 21st century warfare being carried out through psychological means for the ultimate style.
[1:53:56.220 --> 1:54:08.220]  Paul Joseph Watson has written about it at InfoWars.com. This is the way to bring down the globalist is exposing how communist China and the UN were behind the hysteria.
[1:54:26.220 --> 1:54:44.220]  You can hear that I'm frantic and it's because behind the scenes, enemy operations have gone up 5,000% against us and everybody else I know.
[1:54:44.220 --> 1:54:51.220]  And I know what Trump's going through. It's unbelievable. I mean, he is a total badass with what he's put up with and what he's going through.
[1:54:51.220 --> 1:54:59.220]  I mean, I'm no slouch and let me tell you, it's got me just reeling with the things the enemy's doing. It's across the board. It's continual.
[1:54:59.220 --> 1:55:03.220]  It's the takedown of America. The Chai comms are funding it. The EU's funding it. Hollywood's funding it.
[1:55:03.220 --> 1:55:09.220]  They've got people down to the grassroots that know they're part of a plan, know they're taking us down. This is beyond gang warfare.
[1:55:09.220 --> 1:55:19.220]  This is military hatred of America by military. I mean, it's military operations by all this scum that went and got two or three college degrees and were taught they were going to rule America.
[1:55:19.220 --> 1:55:25.220]  Larry Grathwald talks about those videos from the 70s with the weatherman planning the takeover.
[1:55:25.220 --> 1:55:30.220]  And then they spray pen all over Austin. We love Gigi Ping down with America. China occupied Texas.
[1:55:30.220 --> 1:55:39.220]  And you think this is a joke, folks? These people are crazy. So Leo, in Minnesota, you're a proud boy. Tell folks what you've witnessed out there.
[1:55:39.220 --> 1:55:49.220]  Well, Alex, I tell you what, man, I was on the ground when they took the precinct, when they were riding downtown, and I've been here through it all. I was on the bridge when the oil tanker ran through the crowd.
[1:55:49.220 --> 1:55:59.220]  And I mean, I've been front lines the whole time. As far as I can say about Minneapolis, man, they're stuck in their ways. We got a radical attorney general Keith Ellison.
[1:55:59.220 --> 1:56:09.220]  I don't see anything being done in these cities as far as, you know, anything to support Trump. They're going to double down on their agenda.
[1:56:09.220 --> 1:56:15.220]  Everything around the cities is conservative. And we're going to win Minnesota. It's going to be red.
[1:56:15.220 --> 1:56:23.220]  But we got to worry about these people double down because there's going to be a false flag. They're going to change the narrative against Trump supporters before the election.
[1:56:23.220 --> 1:56:31.220]  It's just a matter of time. It's just a matter of where it's just a matter of what event they choose to take advantage of.
[1:56:31.220 --> 1:56:37.220]  I totally agree with you. I mean, what type of false flag you think they're going to pull?
[1:56:37.220 --> 1:56:59.220]  I think they're going to maybe drive a car through a crowd of Antifa with a trunk flag on the back or something. Tend it out windows. You can't see the driver. Maybe they'll shoot into a crowd like they did the Vegas Massacre. I just, you know, I see something real bloody that they can push on the news to demonize Trump.
[1:56:59.220 --> 1:57:08.220]  Well, I totally agree. You know, the Saudis ran that attack, the criminal group did. And that's why we had to occupy Saudi Arabia and the US actually took Saudi Arabia over when that happened.
[1:57:08.220 --> 1:57:19.220]  So Trump's not playing games, but that's a foreign power. So he was able to do that with the military. I don't like to use the military here, but when we're under CHICOM attack, they're the ones wanting to use the military once they get rid of Trump.
[1:57:19.220 --> 1:57:33.220]  I say Trump under the Insurrection Act, you can use the military, but I think instead of fighting crowds of idiot leftists, it's time to use the military against the globalist leadership. I think that's that's George Washington would just wipe out the leadership of the New World Order.
[1:57:33.220 --> 1:57:49.220]  100%. And when will Trump come out on the news and let it be known that these are our enemies? We need a national televised event on everyone's TV, laying out whose names are laying out who's funded Antifa, laying out their agenda because we have it.
[1:57:49.220 --> 1:57:54.220]  Alex, you've been laying it out for how long now? What else do we need?
[1:57:54.220 --> 1:58:06.220]  I just don't know how the average America doesn't have the instincts to know who their enemy is. I mean, just if I was just a purely sociopathic person, Trump would make me more money, I'd be safer, my family would be better, and he would unify everybody so we weren't killing each other.
[1:58:06.220 --> 1:58:19.220]  Instead, why would anybody want to go with the New World Order of the CHICOMs? I mean, no one's going to get anything but heartache from this. That's why it's spiritual, Leo. It's spiritual. These people are under demonic control.
[1:58:19.220 --> 1:58:31.220]  Exactly, and there's a spirit of awakeness going across the globe ever since Trump won, and even Ilhan Omar in my area is losing her control over her people. These Muslims got Lacey Johnson signs up in their yard.
[1:58:31.220 --> 1:58:41.220]  I know, I heard the videos and I saw them. They're really like, we want to be free. We don't want to have her tell us what to do. We thought we're in America. Good. I love that. That's good.
[1:58:41.220 --> 1:59:02.220]  They're losing their grip on their foot soldiers when it comes to Hispanics, blacks, everybody's waking up to their agenda, Alex. It's only a matter of time. It's only, and with the election around the corner, Americans need to surround the White House, millions of them surround the White House until the election happens and until he's inaugurated.
[1:59:02.220 --> 1:59:15.220]  We need to surround the White House. I agree. You just said it. I meant to say that too. Beautiful. You're absolutely, it's in the spirit. Everybody needs to go surround the White House to protect it from the leftist. Your damn right is their plans to attack it. You just said it, brother.
[1:59:32.220 --> 1:59:53.220]  100 million people have died. Probably by the time I finish this talk, Joe Biden has always been a congenital liar. Part of the establishment for close to 50 years. But now, boy, his brain degenerates. We are seeing walking public dementia on the biggest stage in the world, the 2020 election.
[1:59:53.220 --> 2:00:04.220]  There are 370 million people in the United States. If 200 million died from COVID, that'd be more than half of the population, when not even one tenth of 1% have actually died.
[2:00:04.220 --> 2:00:25.220]  But him putting these giant lies and these incredibly brain damaged statements out is emblematic of the general public being in a trance. How is anyone even putting up with this? It is beyond bizarre.
[2:00:34.220 --> 2:00:51.220]  We're live tonight, starting 5 p.m. Central and at 6 p.m. will be commercial free coverage of the first Trump-Biden colossal debate from Cleveland, Ohio. We're going to have crew members.
[2:00:51.220 --> 2:01:04.220]  Greg Rees and others on the ground with live coverage. This is going to be big. And I'm going to be a good boy. I'm going to be here for a couple of hours before it. I'll be here during the debate, but we're not going to talk over it very much.
[2:01:04.220 --> 2:01:21.220]  This is going to be me. Then I'll leave about 15 minutes after the debate ends at 9 p.m. Central, 10 p.m. Eastern, and Owen Schroyer, Daniel Lorraine, Robert Barnes, your calls, and they're going to go till midnight probably. I mean, I would encourage the crew. This is kind of like a little mini 24-hour broadcast here.
[2:01:21.220 --> 2:01:29.220]  I would go till midnight. People are going to want to get on. They're going to want to talk. We're going to have those highlights. And remember, this isn't a war event.
[2:01:29.220 --> 2:01:37.220]  We got excited four years ago during these type of debates, and we would have three million, three and a half million was our record.
[2:01:37.220 --> 2:01:47.220]  IP addresses, click the video and audio streams, extra during debates, and then an election night. I mean, wow. I mean, a normal live show we do that's separate from the regular show.
[2:01:47.220 --> 2:01:52.220]  You know, the regular show has three or four million viewers. Most people exaggerate their audience.
[2:01:52.220 --> 2:02:03.220]  There's four million viewers that come on the side or whatever, and then we have radio stations that pick up millions. So it's hard to quantify it, but despite all the censorship, despite all of it, when you get excited,
[2:02:03.220 --> 2:02:15.220]  since we launched Band-Aid video a year and a half ago, and since we've been doing live feeds where we can see how many IP addresses hit, how many people get on, we've had two-hour, three-hour special live shows that have like 800,000 people.
[2:02:15.220 --> 2:02:26.220]  It's beautiful. That's fantastic. That's eight sports stadiums with 100,000 in it, and most of it's new people. So you already know all this stuff. You're already in the game. You're in the fight.
[2:02:26.220 --> 2:02:34.220]  And all of Big Tech and all their systems is about suppressing your speech, suppressing your votes, suppressing your economy, making you dependent.
[2:02:34.220 --> 2:02:43.220]  Well, energy-wise, the cheapest thing to do is word of mouth, but it's also king. And so anybody will tell you in sales, word of mouth is better than anything.
[2:02:43.220 --> 2:02:48.220]  Better than mail-in, better than anything. Better than a letter somebody gives you. It's word of mouth. Hey, that place has got great hamburgers.
[2:02:48.220 --> 2:02:55.220]  Or, hey, I love my Chevy truck I got, or my Ford truck, whatever it is. Or, hey, I got this fertilizer for my plants. It does better than this one.
[2:02:55.220 --> 2:03:01.220]  You talk to your neighbor, hey, your rose bushes are insane. Mine aren't that good. What do you use? I use this. I go buy it. That's how we're designed as farmers.
[2:03:01.220 --> 2:03:08.220]  We're really at the end of the day farmers. We're not really warriors, folks. We just fight to protect our farms. We're yeoman farmers.
[2:03:08.220 --> 2:03:20.220]  And farmers talk to people. They talk about what works, what plants. And so I'm asking you to farm mines, not by enslaving them like the left does, but by empowering them and sending them free.
[2:03:20.220 --> 2:03:27.220]  So today, go to infowars.com with a live feed. It's already up there, live election coverage 2020 of the debate.
[2:03:27.220 --> 2:03:33.220]  Send that link out and say, hey, here's a live feed of the debate that's going to have behind the scenes analysis. Nobody else is going to have.
[2:03:33.220 --> 2:03:38.220]  Share the 2020ElectionCenter.com link because that doesn't get blocked on Twitter.
[2:03:38.220 --> 2:03:43.220]  All right, now let's look at the Ilhan Omar situation. We'll go back to your calls.
[2:03:43.220 --> 2:03:51.220]  But Josh Hawley is joining us right now. Patrick Hawley. I'm always confusing him with the, I don't know it's Patrick Hawley. I know I'm being funny here.
[2:03:51.220 --> 2:03:56.220]  That's an attempt at humor because I did that last time, ladies and gentlemen. That's an attempt at humor.
[2:03:56.220 --> 2:04:04.220]  I was thinking of the senator from the Midwest, Patrick Hawley, NationalFall.com and at Hawley reporter. I wanted to get him on.
[2:04:04.220 --> 2:04:12.220]  To talk about the Ilhan Omar information, the new things coming out, the Ken Paxson indictments of Democrats, 130 something in Texas.
[2:04:12.220 --> 2:04:23.220]  The new stuff they've dug up also in Texas and other states and how crazy this is and how this is going to fit into the larger campaign.
[2:04:23.220 --> 2:04:29.220]  He also writes on his financialfall.com, but he's written for the epic times as well. So Patrick, thanks for coming on to us.
[2:04:29.220 --> 2:04:31.220]  This is a really crazy time right now.
[2:04:31.220 --> 2:04:36.220]  Yes, Alex. Thank you. And by the way, if I was the senator from Missouri, I think I'd be doing a better job.
[2:04:36.220 --> 2:04:41.220]  That's right. And I guess you are in Missouri part of the time. Aren't you? Or they're in Kansas?
[2:04:41.220 --> 2:04:45.220]  I'm all over the Midwest. I'm a rambling man. I'm like a Bob Dylan song.
[2:04:45.220 --> 2:04:49.220]  I know one day you're in Oklahoma, then you're in Missouri, then you're in Texas, then you're in Kansas.
[2:04:49.220 --> 2:04:54.220]  Well, you're here with us, Senator Howley. No, Patrick Howley. Let's get serious, though.
[2:04:54.220 --> 2:04:59.220]  What do you want to hit first? I mean, all the election fraud we're catching, the Project Veritas bombshell?
[2:04:59.220 --> 2:05:08.220]  Yeah, it's absolutely incredible. Look, I mean, I think we all knew in the back of our heads as soon as the coronavirus scam demoic started that this was going to be about vote by mail.
[2:05:08.220 --> 2:05:17.220]  We started seeing the rollout coming from the Clintons, coming from Stacey Abrams, who we had already contended with back in 2018 in the overtime period down in Georgia,
[2:05:17.220 --> 2:05:25.220]  he was ballot harvesting and they were running a campaign style operation in Georgia back then to try to get votes to find these votes,
[2:05:25.220 --> 2:05:32.220]  find the provisional ballots. Of course, he had people who weren't registered, you had illegal immigrants, people who didn't live in the county voting in Fulton County, right?
[2:05:32.220 --> 2:05:37.220]  There are these kinds of counties. Now, in Texas, the great state of Texas, Harris County is that county.
[2:05:37.220 --> 2:05:48.220]  And so there's a huge effort underway that I'm plugged into and that we're reporting exclusively a national file to expose this massive voter fraud ring that's been going on for years.
[2:05:48.220 --> 2:05:57.220]  This investigation is what led to Attorney General Ken Paxton filing 134 felony charges against four defendants for a vote by mail.
[2:05:57.220 --> 2:06:02.220]  This is the biggest bust of voter fraud ever in history. And now there are new developments.
[2:06:02.220 --> 2:06:14.220]  I got the scoop on two affidavits that were filed yesterday at the Texas Supreme Court from private investigators, including a former top FBI agent stating what is in this investigation,
[2:06:14.220 --> 2:06:19.220]  video evidence, documentation, everything else, which is part of a criminal probe right now.
[2:06:19.220 --> 2:06:24.220]  So this is in the hands of Ken Paxton. This is in the hands of the Texas Secretary of State.
[2:06:24.220 --> 2:06:31.220]  We're rolling it out in a way that doesn't damage the criminal investigation because we want these criminal charges going into the contested election scenario.
[2:06:31.220 --> 2:06:40.220]  But what they have revealed is absolutely shocking and it confirms everything that we've known and that we've been saying.
[2:06:40.220 --> 2:06:44.220]  I'll just read a quick passage from one of these affidavits.
[2:06:44.220 --> 2:06:55.220]  Witnesses have shown me and described to me how the ballot harvesters take absentee ballots from the elderly in nursing homes from the homeless and from unsuspecting residents' mailboxes.
[2:06:55.220 --> 2:07:01.220]  The ballot harvesters then complete the ballots for their preferred candidate and forge the signature of the voter.
[2:07:01.220 --> 2:07:12.220]  Two witnesses stated to me that there are two individuals employed at the Harris County clerk's office who are aware of the illegal ballots and help facilitate and mask the processing of the ballots into the legal stream of ballots.
[2:07:12.220 --> 2:07:20.220]  Now, we've already published a video showing them going into a nursing home in 2018 and doing this, you know, having the old people just put in actual ballots.
[2:07:20.220 --> 2:07:26.220]  You were on a month ago saying this was coming. You guys had broke that. That's exactly what Ilhan Omar is doing. It's what Governor Cuomo is doing.
[2:07:26.220 --> 2:07:33.220]  This is the Democrat. They're in Broward County. They go in and ballot harvest, which is illegal in most areas.
[2:07:33.220 --> 2:07:44.220]  Yes, that's right. And by the way, there's an old person who has denied food until they agreed to vote for the person that the nursing home attendant wanted them to vote for.
[2:07:44.220 --> 2:07:55.220]  The nursing homes are in on this. And so when you have Harris County sending out these ballot applications to everybody in the county who's 65 and over, that means the nursing homes are still ground zero.
[2:07:55.220 --> 2:07:56.220]  Sure.
[2:07:56.220 --> 2:08:14.220]  But I just heard the record skip there. Boy, I want the interview with that person. I'm offering $10,000 for the interview with, I believe it because they admit they do that in other areas. They beat them up if they don't, that they literally won't give them food unless they vote for Democrats. God, these people are sick.
[2:08:14.220 --> 2:08:27.220]  Yep, that's right. And now we know that the Biden campaigns, Texas political director is named in these affidavits. The Biden campaign is named in this and in one of these affidavits.
[2:08:27.220 --> 2:08:35.220]  So we know that. And I was told in no uncertain terms, this is going on during the 2020 presidential election, Texas started mailing out the absentee ballots.
[2:08:35.220 --> 2:08:39.220]  Of course, it is all the stuff they did Nile and everything was a beta test.
[2:08:39.220 --> 2:08:54.220]  Yep. So this is an absolute definitive link between Dallas Jones, the recently hired Texas political director for the Joe Biden Kamala Harris campaign, and this massive Harris County operation, which ensnares a lot of Democrats Sheila Jackson Lee, employing convicted
[2:08:54.220 --> 2:09:07.220]  forgers on her campaign effort. So the whole the Democrats in Texas in the Houston area are as sleazy as they can get. And they honestly thought they could flip Texas in Houston by finding all these votes were on to it.
[2:09:07.220 --> 2:09:11.220]  And over the next five and a half weeks, we're not going to let them get away with it.
[2:09:11.220 --> 2:09:23.220]  Well, election fraud is legendary in Texas and Illinois and other states, but I love my state, but it's true Democrats go back to LBJ bragging about box 13 and all that. I mean, they're well known for doing this.
[2:09:23.220 --> 2:09:36.220]  Yep, absolutely right. And, you know, LBJ was a hard knuckle politician. There was maybe some things to to admire about him, like when he said that his opponent was, you know, fornicating with a dog and then he said, you know, make him deny it.
[2:09:36.220 --> 2:09:45.220]  But obviously, you know, the Democrats are just as sleazy as it gets. They're getting sleazier. And now what they're doing is they're operating in service of the Communist takeover of the United States.
[2:09:45.220 --> 2:09:59.220]  So, you know, you have to put aside this kind of 2D narrative. And by the way, this isn't the mainstream right now. Don Jr. is tweeting out my work. This is very much in the center and in the focus of what what's going to happen over the next few weeks.
[2:09:59.220 --> 2:10:12.220]  Exactly. We talk about 34 days, but what about the 79 after that? Let's talk about the 79 days of hell. The Democrats say they're they know they're losing. They're going to contest. How is that unfold? What does that look like? That's tomorrow's news today.
[2:10:12.220 --> 2:10:32.220]  The planets have aligned globally. They've aligned nationally. They've aligned financially, culturally, but most importantly, spiritually. We are living at a point in human development that will decide the entire future destiny of our species.
[2:10:32.220 --> 2:10:44.220]  That's why big tech control with the very dark forces of the globalist is trying to dumb us down, isolate us, make us depressed, make us alone and traffic control every aspect of our lives.
[2:10:44.220 --> 2:10:56.220]  Literally, brainwashing us with the stimuli that they look forward because they do not want us to take our birthright, not just of Americana but of true Christendom and the Renaissance and the Enlightenment.
[2:10:56.220 --> 2:11:10.220]  They are trying to create the new dark age where they have all the high technology and life extension and we are walled off in a technocracy that controls us through carbon credits and through a social credit score. This is their plan.
[2:11:10.220 --> 2:11:15.220]  We must come together and awaken out of our trance and say no, we must embrace God.
[2:11:15.220 --> 2:11:29.220]  The way the psychological warfare operation works is very, very simple. They give up freedoms by increments, always promising it's only going to be a short period of time and then the restrictions will be released, but they're not.
[2:11:29.220 --> 2:11:45.220]  They have a significant amount of time, always four or five times longer than what they said. They will then slightly release it a little bit, only tighten it down even more later. This is called successive approximation, incrementalism or the inchworm effect.
[2:11:45.220 --> 2:12:02.220]  This is the most common way that the Salaterians take over, but there then becomes a point where the public wakes up. Under the incrementalism, it starts resisting and then there's usually a giant purge and a clamp down and you'll see more tyranny rolled out in just a few days, weeks or months than you saw in the previous ten years.
[2:12:02.220 --> 2:12:15.220]  And that's the period we're in globally right now. A world government, chai combat, globalist corporate takeover of the planet that wants you poor and absolutely sick under their thumb forever.
[2:12:32.220 --> 2:12:43.220]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[2:13:02.220 --> 2:13:13.220]  Democrats don't care. They want to steal the election and have enough votes that night, I guess, to say Trump loses, Biden wins, but regardless, they've said, Patrick, that they're going to hold it up.
[2:13:13.220 --> 2:13:24.220]  They think they're going to lose and then use that to divide the country further and create a civil war and secession. Incredible admissions by John Podesta of the New York Times two months ago now confirmed.
[2:13:24.220 --> 2:13:36.220]  Why would they be so open about it? And do people need to understand that 34 days is just the election? It's the next 79 after that, whether it takes a day to contest it or 70 days or 79.
[2:13:36.220 --> 2:13:52.220]  Pelosi has said, she came out yesterday and said, we have prepared the House to vote if there's not a president put in, if it's contested by the 20th, if it's still contested, Democrats don't give up, their courts don't give up, that the House of Representatives will decide who the president is.
[2:13:52.220 --> 2:14:09.220]  And she said two months ago, that would be her. Talk about megalomania. Talk about twilight zone. Talk about over the top. I mean, I can't even believe this is happening. And I'm Alex Jones. I was expecting craziness, but this is just, and we're only getting started here, Patrick.
[2:14:09.220 --> 2:14:24.220]  Predictive programming all of this with that show House of Cards a few years ago to try to get people into the mind that it's somehow glamorous that these corrupt politicians are doing these backroom deals and trying to subvert democracy and whatnot.
[2:14:24.220 --> 2:14:32.220]  So I think it was all leading up to this and what we're seeing right now is a situation where, look, President Donald Trump is the head of state. He is the commander in chief of the military.
[2:14:32.220 --> 2:14:39.220]  The chairman of the joint chiefs has said that he doesn't believe it's the military's role to intercede in an election and drag Trump out of office.
[2:14:39.220 --> 2:14:52.220]  If the Democrats don't recognize Trump's victory, then I believe that they are the ones who are seceding. I believe that they're the ones who are rebelling against ability.
[2:14:52.220 --> 2:15:01.220]  And so, you know, I would treat them as the Confederates in the sense that, you know, there's going to be a big question.
[2:15:01.220 --> 2:15:09.220]  By the way, Podesta says they're in the role of Confederates. And so what's incredible is history is repeating itself again with different players.
[2:15:09.220 --> 2:15:18.220]  But just like we had eugenics come up in the 1920s and forced inoculations of sterilization, it's back again too. It's like everything's coming back.
[2:15:18.220 --> 2:15:24.220]  Right. Well, we hope that peace holds up, but obviously we haven't seen peace coming from Black Lives Matter and Antifa.
[2:15:24.220 --> 2:15:28.220]  They will have their riot squads ready to go. They will be intimidating people.
[2:15:28.220 --> 2:15:35.220]  They'll be intimidating people outside of the polls on election day because the Trump voters are going to show up in person because obviously we don't trust vote by mail.
[2:15:35.220 --> 2:15:43.220]  When we see, you know, ballots in a ditch in Wisconsin, when we see the military ballots being tampered with and discarded in the state of Pennsylvania.
[2:15:43.220 --> 2:15:50.220]  So, you know, they will have the riot squads ready to go. They did this mask thing right before Antifa started rampaging around the country.
[2:15:50.220 --> 2:15:56.220]  And by the way, the masks, we got a little kid now who has a rash on his face with masks.
[2:15:56.220 --> 2:16:00.220]  There have been multiple kids in this world who have died in gym class wearing a mask on their face.
[2:16:00.220 --> 2:16:03.220]  So they are demoralizing us. They're trying to depress us.
[2:16:03.220 --> 2:16:07.220]  They're trying to suffocate us. They're literally like a psycho puts a ball gag in your mouth.
[2:16:07.220 --> 2:16:13.220]  Yep. And they're trying to send the message that, you know, if we feel bad about ourselves, if we feel demoralized,
[2:16:13.220 --> 2:16:23.220]  then we're not going to have the ability to fight back against them peacefully or to represent our own interests when they try to take the whole country away from us.
[2:16:23.220 --> 2:16:27.220]  And we're already locked down. It's about us already being locked up when they then bring in their own martial law.
[2:16:27.220 --> 2:16:30.220]  I don't think it's going to work, Patrick.
[2:16:30.220 --> 2:16:37.220]  No, I don't think it's going to work because you see the resilience of the American people. The American people love freedom.
[2:16:37.220 --> 2:16:41.220]  Yes, I know that these social justice warriors are out there saying what they think they have to say.
[2:16:41.220 --> 2:16:44.220]  But even they want to be free. Even they want to walk around outside.
[2:16:44.220 --> 2:16:48.220]  Even they want to go to their normie bars and nightclubs and everything else.
[2:16:48.220 --> 2:16:54.220]  So in America, you really just can't take people's freedom away. We're not there yet. And I don't think we'll ever be there.
[2:16:54.220 --> 2:17:00.220]  I agree. What else is a million things to talk about? What do you think is going to happen in the debate tonight?
[2:17:00.220 --> 2:17:03.220]  What should Trump look out for? I agree. He's in the pole position to win.
[2:17:03.220 --> 2:17:10.220]  We're still out of the woods once he wins, though, because the banks and the globalists are still going to try to spike the economy.
[2:17:10.220 --> 2:17:18.220]  Yeah. So I think it's important for President Donald Trump, knowing him as I do, having observed him as I have,
[2:17:18.220 --> 2:17:25.220]  to try to run circles around Joe Biden in a way that confuses him, makes him seem like he is mentally declining,
[2:17:25.220 --> 2:17:29.220]  which we all know he is. They are going to try to keep him as scripted as possible.
[2:17:29.220 --> 2:17:37.220]  And so anything that Trump can do to try to shake it up, to try to get Joe off of his footing, that's what he needs to do.
[2:17:37.220 --> 2:17:42.220]  I mean, he came at Hillary Clinton last time in a way that totally shocked her.
[2:17:42.220 --> 2:17:48.220]  Well, in the first debate, he didn't, but the next two, he did. And I agree. He should say, like, it's OK. Do you need a nap, Joe?
[2:17:48.220 --> 2:17:55.220]  I mean, little stuff like that's going to enrage Biden. I think you should piss Biden off early and Biden will fall like a house of cards.
[2:17:55.220 --> 2:18:01.220]  I think so, because Biden has anger issues and he's not really capable of controlling his emotions anymore,
[2:18:01.220 --> 2:18:06.220]  because, you know, he doesn't have a filter. He doesn't have the ability to modulate his brain anymore.
[2:18:06.220 --> 2:18:14.220]  So if Trump makes him angry and Trump's funny, that's a big thing that he has going for him more so than any other politician.
[2:18:14.220 --> 2:18:15.220]  Trump is actually a leader.
[2:18:15.220 --> 2:18:20.220]  I love how you said 200 million Americans died of COVID. You know, it's 200,000, right, Joe?
[2:18:20.220 --> 2:18:24.220]  I mean, just oh my God, I would devastate Joe Biden. Man, I'd love to get the ring with him.
[2:18:24.220 --> 2:18:27.220]  Because it's like literally debating a baboon or something.
[2:18:27.220 --> 2:18:31.220]  I hope Trump comes prepared. I've heard that he has been preparing.
[2:18:31.220 --> 2:18:36.220]  So, you know, he's got to come in there with the strategy and he's got to be absolutely vicious.
[2:18:36.220 --> 2:18:42.220]  And Trump knows what the stakes are. He knows he's the representative of America going up against the communist anarchist takeover.
[2:18:42.220 --> 2:18:44.220]  So he understands the responsibility.
[2:18:44.220 --> 2:18:50.220]  No, I totally agree. If you talk about advising Trump, I did in a phone call tell Trump after the first thing with Hillary.
[2:18:50.220 --> 2:18:53.220]  I said, listen, you got to go have the juggler. I know you're being told by people being nice to her.
[2:18:53.220 --> 2:18:57.220]  No, that's viewers want to see you attack her. And Trump goes, no, you're right. I agree with you.
[2:18:57.220 --> 2:19:01.220]  He needs to just mop the floor with Biden. He needs to destroy him.
[2:19:01.220 --> 2:19:07.220]  Absolutely. And we're programmed for this with cable news. Cable news is vicious. Cable news is over the top.
[2:19:07.220 --> 2:19:10.220]  And that's like normal. That's what people see day in and day out.
[2:19:10.220 --> 2:19:15.220]  So in a debate where the feet of Western civilization is hinging on this, he has to go so over the top.
[2:19:15.220 --> 2:19:20.220]  Trump needs to finish him. Call him a Chinese agent. Call him a joke. Call him a fraud.
[2:19:20.220 --> 2:19:22.220]  Say, look how arrogant you are. You can't even talk.
[2:19:22.220 --> 2:19:28.220]  That all these strokes, you're up real estate, you're pathetic. You and your criminal son, when he brings up Trump's tax returns,
[2:19:28.220 --> 2:19:31.220]  say everybody knows in real estate you're supposed to run a loss.
[2:19:31.220 --> 2:19:34.220]  You know, at least I build stuff in America. You just sell us up and shining a piece of filth.
[2:19:34.220 --> 2:19:37.220]  I mean, I would just annihilate that piece of garbage.
[2:19:37.220 --> 2:19:44.220]  Oh, absolutely right. And you know, Joe Biden is, you know, somebody who his own running mate even tried to meet to him.
[2:19:44.220 --> 2:19:46.220]  And Trump has said that out on the campaign.
[2:19:46.220 --> 2:19:51.220]  Oh, Kamala Harris said, you're the worst guy. You're a police state thug. Yeah.
[2:19:51.220 --> 2:19:58.220]  Yeah. So Trump out on the rallies is giving me hope because you're seeing that 2015 and 2016 energy from him.
[2:19:58.220 --> 2:20:01.220]  And it's all leading up to this. It's all leading up to tonight.
[2:20:01.220 --> 2:20:04.220]  So obviously I'm going to be on the edge of my seat with the popcorn ready.
[2:20:04.220 --> 2:20:08.220]  And this is going to be a night that will live in history.
[2:20:08.220 --> 2:20:12.220]  Well, you should pop in sometime because I'm told the crew is going to go to like midnight.
[2:20:12.220 --> 2:20:15.220]  It's going to be huge viewers. Please tell folks you're coming on with your great audience.
[2:20:15.220 --> 2:20:18.220]  I hope you and Papert join us because I'm going to be a good boy.
[2:20:18.220 --> 2:20:24.220]  Yeah. After the debate ends at like 9 30 central, I'm going to make my statement for like five, 10 minutes.
[2:20:24.220 --> 2:20:28.220]  And then I'm going to go home to my family and it's going to be Owen shroyer.
[2:20:28.220 --> 2:20:31.220]  It's going to be the Arnold rain. It's going to be all you guys and callers.
[2:20:31.220 --> 2:20:37.220]  I want to take calls because it's going to be big. What else is on your radar right now? Patrick Howley.
[2:20:37.220 --> 2:20:42.220]  Well, you know, vote by mail is the big thing, but I've got a lot more coming about the pedophile rings.
[2:20:42.220 --> 2:20:45.220]  I've got a lot more coming about Gillian Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein.
[2:20:45.220 --> 2:20:50.220]  This is a perfect storm, so to speak of stuff that's coming together in the last weeks of this election.
[2:20:50.220 --> 2:20:55.220]  People are plugged into it and it's a truly an amazing time to be alive all over the world.
[2:20:55.220 --> 2:20:59.220]  We're seeing amazing progress for the kinds of stuff that you've been talking about for the last 20 years.
[2:20:59.220 --> 2:21:02.220]  Well, we certainly are, Patrick Howley. Hold on. I've got loaded phones.
[2:21:02.220 --> 2:21:05.220]  I'm going to go to JB and Robert and Justin and everybody.
[2:21:05.220 --> 2:21:07.220]  We're going to go to all these calls and Leander. We're going to go to all the calls.
[2:21:07.220 --> 2:21:11.220]  I don't want you just to give us a little prelude to what's coming up with the pedophile ring stuff.
[2:21:11.220 --> 2:21:14.220]  There's been some big developments on that.
[2:21:14.220 --> 2:21:21.220]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[2:21:29.220 --> 2:21:43.220]  Infowars has been banned, arrested, attacked and threatened because we are effective.
[2:21:43.220 --> 2:21:51.220]  Great Awakening is here. Go to banned.video, download the videos and share.
[2:21:51.220 --> 2:22:10.220]  Support the information war at infowarstore.com and never give up the fight.
[2:22:10.220 --> 2:22:21.220]  And perhaps most cruelly of all, if Donald Trump has his way, the complications from COVID-19,
[2:22:21.220 --> 2:22:30.220]  which are well beyond what they should be, it's estimated that 200 million people have died.
[2:22:30.220 --> 2:22:36.220]  200 million people have died. Probably by the time I finish this talk.
[2:22:36.220 --> 2:22:42.220]  Right after Joe Biden made that statement that more than 60% of America has died from COVID-19
[2:22:42.220 --> 2:22:48.220]  when it's not even 200,000 in reality, he would want to say 6 million have lung scarring and heart damage.
[2:22:48.220 --> 2:22:50.220]  It's all made up. But you know where he got it?
[2:22:50.220 --> 2:22:53.220]  The mainstream media that continues to actually say things like that.
[2:22:53.220 --> 2:22:58.220]  They said that 4% of America would be dead already.
[2:22:58.220 --> 2:23:03.220]  Of course, it's.000 and then add a number because the numbers vary.
[2:23:03.220 --> 2:23:07.220]  It's a real virus, just like people being struck by lightning is real.
[2:23:07.220 --> 2:23:13.220]  But to shut down society over lightning strikes is hysteria and is mind control.
[2:23:13.220 --> 2:23:18.220]  Introducing Infowars Life Pure Turmeric Extract.
[2:23:18.220 --> 2:23:22.220]  This is taken under the tongue. It is pure turmeric.
[2:23:22.220 --> 2:23:29.220]  It goes together very well with our body's ultimate turmeric formula that is taken as a powdered capsule
[2:23:29.220 --> 2:23:32.220]  and absorbed in the stomach and intestines.
[2:23:32.220 --> 2:23:38.220]  This is absorbed under the tongue into the bloodstream and then the remaining also is then absorbed by the stomach.
[2:23:38.220 --> 2:23:40.220]  So it's more of an intense delivery system.
[2:23:40.220 --> 2:23:45.220]  The two formulas are different, but both are concentrates and our first product got rave reviews.

[2:23:47.220 --> 2:23:51.220]  Some of our staff like it more than bodies. Some like bodies better.

[2:24:36.220 --> 2:24:40.220]  So wainless, I filled with sin.
[2:24:40.220 --> 2:24:44.220]  I wouldn't let my dear savior in.
[2:24:44.220 --> 2:24:49.220]  Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night.
[2:24:49.220 --> 2:24:53.220]  Praise the Lord. I saw the light.
[2:24:53.220 --> 2:24:56.220]  I saw the light. I saw the light.
[2:24:56.220 --> 2:24:59.220]  I saw the light. I saw the light.
[2:24:59.220 --> 2:25:03.220]  You know, you can ignore God all day until you realize the spiritual battle.
[2:25:03.220 --> 2:25:07.220]  You don't face to face with the devil and his minions.
[2:25:07.220 --> 2:25:11.220]  Patrick Howley, naturalphile.com, Epic Times as well. He's here just finishing up.
[2:25:11.220 --> 2:25:15.220]  I wanted to get you on like a week ago and I don't know if we did it or maybe I never got to it.
[2:25:15.220 --> 2:25:18.220]  We have the Attorney General of the Virgin Islands ordering the Flight Logs release.
[2:25:18.220 --> 2:25:21.220]  We know Bill Clinton, Bill Gates were on board to the pedophile island.
[2:25:21.220 --> 2:25:25.220]  There's a lot of other big pieces moving. Give us a prelude of some of the great...
[2:25:25.220 --> 2:25:29.220]  I know you've been at the tip of the spear exposing this with all the minutiae.
[2:25:29.220 --> 2:25:31.220]  Give us the latest that's coming up.
[2:25:31.220 --> 2:25:36.220]  Well, yeah, it's incredible. I mean, we have been at the tip of the spear for over five years now.
[2:25:36.220 --> 2:25:41.220]  It was CPAC back in 2015 before Trump even announced where he did the interview.
[2:25:41.220 --> 2:25:45.220]  It was with Sean Hannity and he said, Bill Clinton has big Jeffrey Epstein problem.
[2:25:45.220 --> 2:25:50.220]  And ever since then, these kinds of things have been like tectonic plates and they've been moving together.
[2:25:50.220 --> 2:25:58.220]  We have Nexium, we have the Bronfman family, this Claire Bronfman awaiting sentencing, Keith Reneire awaiting sentencing.
[2:25:58.220 --> 2:26:01.220]  You have Guillain Maxwell in jail.
[2:26:01.220 --> 2:26:06.220]  You have Harvey Weinstein in prison who has been totally excommunicated from this network and is bitter.
[2:26:06.220 --> 2:26:08.220]  So I hear he is jealous.
[2:26:08.220 --> 2:26:14.220]  He is enraged that they knocked him off of his pedestal and put him into prison over sleeping with actresses.
[2:26:14.220 --> 2:26:19.220]  You have Kevin Spacey who is still out there who, you know, there's some mysterious deaths surrounding him.
[2:26:19.220 --> 2:26:21.220]  You had Oprah's friend John of God.
[2:26:21.220 --> 2:26:24.220]  You had, I mean, everybody wants to talk about the Haitian children.
[2:26:24.220 --> 2:26:29.220]  You know, we still have the situation of Laura Sillsby who is down there in Haiti.
[2:26:29.220 --> 2:26:34.220]  The Clinton Foundation and Bill Clinton got her out of the jam where she was accused of human trafficking.
[2:26:34.220 --> 2:26:36.220]  We all know what they were doing in Haiti.
[2:26:36.220 --> 2:26:48.220]  This network, this cabal, this coalition of insane sociopaths is finally under the microscope and they're finally being prosecuted.
[2:26:48.220 --> 2:26:51.220]  And it's an Agatha Christie novel of who's going to flip on who.
[2:26:51.220 --> 2:26:59.220]  Now, I do know that Keith Reneire has an interest in talking in order to try to lessen his own sentence.
[2:26:59.220 --> 2:27:03.220]  And I know that some of these people, and I hope they keep Keith Reneire safe, not because he's a good guy.
[2:27:03.220 --> 2:27:11.220]  But, you know, with Epstein when he was, you know, suicide and he was killed, oh, he killed himself, right?
[2:27:11.220 --> 2:27:21.220]  That sent the message that, you know, the Clintons and that crew, that those folks are desperate.
[2:27:21.220 --> 2:27:28.220]  They're panicking and they realize that the blackmail operation that has propped up their political control.
[2:27:28.220 --> 2:27:30.220]  It's not just about the pedophilia.
[2:27:30.220 --> 2:27:32.220]  It's not just about the Aleister Crowley Satanism.
[2:27:32.220 --> 2:27:35.220]  Obviously, honestly, that was a ruse to a certain degree.
[2:27:35.220 --> 2:27:37.220]  I don't think Jeffrey Epstein even really believed it.
[2:27:37.220 --> 2:27:40.220]  Those are just Tim Blight's thing and other people rubbed in with.
[2:27:40.220 --> 2:27:41.220]  That's absolutely right.
[2:27:41.220 --> 2:27:42.220]  And the Clintons are dupes.
[2:27:42.220 --> 2:27:46.220]  You know, the Clintons are road scholars and they're, oh, yeah, this is what you got to do.
[2:27:46.220 --> 2:27:49.220]  Oh, you got to go down to Epstein Island and do this horrible stuff.
[2:27:49.220 --> 2:27:53.220]  Meanwhile, Epstein was laughing because then he gets all this stuff on camera.
[2:27:53.220 --> 2:27:55.220]  The FBI is not necessarily on our side.
[2:27:55.220 --> 2:28:00.220]  The FBI went down to Epstein Island, of course, afterward, and then a lot of stuff disappeared.
[2:28:00.220 --> 2:28:03.220]  But there's so much evidence out there.
[2:28:03.220 --> 2:28:04.220]  The evidence is backed up.
[2:28:04.220 --> 2:28:05.220]  It's saved.
[2:28:05.220 --> 2:28:06.220]  People are talking.
[2:28:06.220 --> 2:28:12.220]  And I predict that you're going to see the Bronfman Nexwell Nexus, which, of course,
[2:28:12.220 --> 2:28:16.220]  is closely linked to the Mossad Agency, begin to lose a lot of power.
[2:28:16.220 --> 2:28:19.220]  And some of these rogue agencies are going to be reined in.
[2:28:19.220 --> 2:28:21.220]  I agree with that.
[2:28:21.220 --> 2:28:22.220]  And that's what we know.
[2:28:22.220 --> 2:28:23.220]  And it's not an anti-Israel thing.
[2:28:23.220 --> 2:28:24.220]  It's not a pro-Israel thing.
[2:28:24.220 --> 2:28:25.220]  It's a fact.
[2:28:25.220 --> 2:28:29.220]  But Netanyahu is doing horrible things with lockdowns, horrible things with COVID.
[2:28:29.220 --> 2:28:31.220]  I can't tell what Netanyahu is doing.
[2:28:31.220 --> 2:28:35.220]  But isn't it Omer and that other group of Israelis are kind of hooked into Epstein?
[2:28:35.220 --> 2:28:38.220]  It looks like that's that group's losing power right now.
[2:28:38.220 --> 2:28:40.220]  A lot of this is an internal war.
[2:28:40.220 --> 2:28:43.220]  It looks like within Shin Bet and the Mossad and the Israelis as well.
[2:28:43.220 --> 2:28:49.220]  Well, I believe the Mossad went after Netanyahu in the same way, really, that the CIA and
[2:28:49.220 --> 2:28:50.220]  the FBI went after Trump.
[2:28:50.220 --> 2:28:54.220]  It was Arnan Milchand that set Netanyahu up with the cigars.
[2:28:54.220 --> 2:29:00.220]  And Arnan Milchand, who's a Hollywood producer, obviously a longtime Mossad asset, very similar
[2:29:00.220 --> 2:29:01.220]  to Robert Knoxville.
[2:29:01.220 --> 2:29:05.220]  It's on record that it's the opposition group and the Rothschilds that are part of that,
[2:29:05.220 --> 2:29:06.220]  that are against Netanyahu.
[2:29:06.220 --> 2:29:07.220]  Yeah.
[2:29:07.220 --> 2:29:09.220]  Why is there a split from your research between the Rothschilds and Netanyahu?
[2:29:09.220 --> 2:29:10.220]  That's a real split.
[2:29:10.220 --> 2:29:12.220]  I mean, they really want to get Netanyahu.
[2:29:12.220 --> 2:29:16.220]  And then Netanyahu is, you know, fighting them.
[2:29:16.220 --> 2:29:17.220]  It's very sophisticated.
[2:29:17.220 --> 2:29:20.220]  Well, Netanyahu is an Israeli nationalist.
[2:29:20.220 --> 2:29:21.220]  He's on the right wing.
[2:29:21.220 --> 2:29:22.220]  He's a conservative.
[2:29:22.220 --> 2:29:25.220]  And he also strongly supports President Donald Trump.
[2:29:25.220 --> 2:29:27.220]  The Rothschilds are enraged by Trump.
[2:29:27.220 --> 2:29:32.220]  They are absolutely enraged by the fact that the people of the United States exercised some
[2:29:32.220 --> 2:29:34.220]  kind of power, had some kind of agency.
[2:29:34.220 --> 2:29:35.220]  Sure, exactly.
[2:29:35.220 --> 2:29:37.220]  All I'm saying is everybody, like, says Israel is one group.
[2:29:37.220 --> 2:29:38.220]  It's not just like us.
[2:29:38.220 --> 2:29:41.220]  It's a bunch of fighting, you know, groups.
[2:29:41.220 --> 2:29:47.220]  And clearly, clearly, you had Omer and these other Israeli operatives running the thing
[2:29:47.220 --> 2:29:49.220]  with the Clintons and that thing's going down right now.
[2:29:49.220 --> 2:29:50.220]  That's a good thing.
[2:29:50.220 --> 2:29:51.220]  Oh, absolutely.
[2:29:51.220 --> 2:29:55.220]  And the reason that Netanyahu, unfortunately, is going to have to cede power to this Benny
[2:29:55.220 --> 2:30:01.220]  Ganskai at some point in the near future is because they have used immigration in Israel
[2:30:01.220 --> 2:30:03.220]  the same way they've used it in the United States.
[2:30:03.220 --> 2:30:07.220]  They bring in an Arab voting block and then we had three elections in a row where Netanyahu
[2:30:07.220 --> 2:30:08.220]  is the clear winner.
[2:30:08.220 --> 2:30:12.220]  But because they pushed through enough Arab votes legitimately or otherwise, they couldn't
[2:30:12.220 --> 2:30:14.220]  get a clear win.
[2:30:14.220 --> 2:30:18.220]  And so they use immigration the same way they use immigration in the United States, the
[2:30:18.220 --> 2:30:20.220]  globalist, the Rothschild wing.
[2:30:20.220 --> 2:30:25.220]  And they hope that they can change the demographics of Western sovereign countries to strip away
[2:30:25.220 --> 2:30:26.220]  the sovereignty.
[2:30:26.220 --> 2:30:27.220]  Sure.
[2:30:27.220 --> 2:30:28.220]  Because I really hear you.
[2:30:28.220 --> 2:30:29.220]  Do you work for Israel?
[2:30:29.220 --> 2:30:30.220]  I've never been to Israel.
[2:30:30.220 --> 2:30:31.220]  I'm not against Israel existing.
[2:30:31.220 --> 2:30:32.220]  I don't hate Jews.
[2:30:32.220 --> 2:30:33.220]  I don't say this.
[2:30:33.220 --> 2:30:34.220]  It's a diverse group of people.
[2:30:34.220 --> 2:30:37.220]  But clearly, I know the power structure and the Rothschilds don't like Netanyahu.
[2:30:37.220 --> 2:30:38.220]  They don't like Trump.
[2:30:38.220 --> 2:30:42.220]  Of course, Trump's got a bunch of pro-Israel folks behind him, but that's another group.
[2:30:42.220 --> 2:30:46.220]  So it's just people that are all anti-Israel need to actually grow up and get more sophisticated.
[2:30:46.220 --> 2:30:50.220]  Why do you think BB then is doing the horrible lockdowns and all this?
[2:30:50.220 --> 2:30:53.220]  I try to hold on to power using it?
[2:30:53.220 --> 2:30:55.220]  I mean, I don't know.
[2:30:55.220 --> 2:30:57.220]  Well, you know, that's up to him.
[2:30:57.220 --> 2:31:00.220]  I mean, there's almost every head of state is doing that.
[2:31:00.220 --> 2:31:02.220]  Trump has been a little bit better.
[2:31:02.220 --> 2:31:05.220]  You know, my friend Brian Kent, the great governor of Georgia has really been leading
[2:31:05.220 --> 2:31:06.220]  the way.
[2:31:06.220 --> 2:31:10.220]  But for some reason, the globalist power structure is all in on this lockdown all over the world
[2:31:10.220 --> 2:31:11.220]  and a lot of leaders.
[2:31:11.220 --> 2:31:12.220]  Because it gives all group power.
[2:31:12.220 --> 2:31:13.220]  Exactly.
[2:31:13.220 --> 2:31:14.220]  All right.
[2:31:14.220 --> 2:31:15.220]  Great job.
[2:31:15.220 --> 2:31:16.220]  There you go.
[2:31:16.220 --> 2:31:17.220]  There he goes.
[2:31:17.220 --> 2:31:18.220]  All right.
[2:31:18.220 --> 2:31:19.220]  Patrick Howley, thank you.
[2:31:19.220 --> 2:31:20.220]  All right.
[2:31:20.220 --> 2:31:21.220]  Let's start going to some calls.
[2:31:21.220 --> 2:31:22.220]  The guys are popping in.
[2:31:22.220 --> 2:31:23.220]  I appreciate it.
[2:31:23.220 --> 2:31:24.220]  Great, great, great guest.
[2:31:24.220 --> 2:31:25.220]  Okay.
[2:31:25.220 --> 2:31:26.220]  Who's up next here?
[2:31:26.220 --> 2:31:27.220]  Lander in Wyoming.
[2:31:27.220 --> 2:31:28.220]  Lander, thanks for holding.
[2:31:28.220 --> 2:31:29.220]  Hey, Alex.
[2:31:29.220 --> 2:31:35.220]  So earlier in the show, when you were showing the videos of Parscale getting tackled by those
[2:31:35.220 --> 2:31:40.220]  police, really all that kept running through my head is, how are these leftist police going
[2:31:40.220 --> 2:31:44.220]  to behave when they're behind the control centers of the alphabet robots?
[2:31:44.220 --> 2:31:45.220]  What are they going to do then?
[2:31:45.220 --> 2:31:49.220]  Are they going to have drone swarms hitting us with fentanyl or what?
[2:31:49.220 --> 2:31:50.220]  I totally agree.
[2:31:50.220 --> 2:31:54.220]  Because that's a liberal police department and they tackle a guy that's doing that.
[2:31:54.220 --> 2:31:57.220]  I mean, imagine if the cops were going to black guy like this, I'd be against it.
[2:31:57.220 --> 2:31:58.220]  He did nothing.
[2:31:58.220 --> 2:32:00.220]  Yeah, there's a lot of that.
[2:32:00.220 --> 2:32:04.220]  You don't really hear much outrage unless it's someone black lives matter.
[2:32:04.220 --> 2:32:08.220]  And then look at this woman, like, swagger over and they're all on top of him.
[2:32:08.220 --> 2:32:09.220]  This is just pure BS, man.
[2:32:09.220 --> 2:32:13.220]  I don't care if it was a black guy or a white guy, that's wrong what you see there.
[2:32:13.220 --> 2:32:17.220]  Well, you know, there are going to be riots tonight outside of the debates.
[2:32:17.220 --> 2:32:20.220]  I kind of wonder what sort of things like this we're going to be seeing there.
[2:32:20.220 --> 2:32:22.220]  We're going to have our own crew there.
[2:32:22.220 --> 2:32:23.220]  They volunteered to go.
[2:32:23.220 --> 2:32:24.220]  I don't put them in arms way.
[2:32:24.220 --> 2:32:25.220]  They want to go.
[2:32:25.220 --> 2:32:26.220]  Greg Greece and crew are going to be there.
[2:32:26.220 --> 2:32:27.220]  What do you expect tonight?
[2:32:27.220 --> 2:32:30.220]  I think Trump is going to annihilate Joe Biden.
[2:32:30.220 --> 2:32:33.220]  Oh, no, no doubt, no doubt at all.
[2:32:33.220 --> 2:32:37.220]  I mean, it seems to me like they wouldn't even want Biden to get onto the stage.
[2:32:37.220 --> 2:32:40.220]  It seems like they'd want some excuse to cancel it, in my opinion.
[2:32:40.220 --> 2:32:41.220]  I agree.
[2:32:41.220 --> 2:32:44.220]  A team of viewers can see Greg Greece right there on the River Rock.
[2:32:44.220 --> 2:32:45.220]  I like Cleveland, man.
[2:32:45.220 --> 2:32:46.220]  They call it like the Rust Belt.
[2:32:46.220 --> 2:32:47.220]  Love the people.
[2:32:47.220 --> 2:32:48.220]  Love the food.
[2:32:48.220 --> 2:32:50.220]  I weigh 400 pounds when I lived in Cleveland, man.
[2:32:50.220 --> 2:32:52.220]  The food there was like, what the hell?
[2:32:52.220 --> 2:32:54.220]  Everywhere I eat, Cleveland was amazing.
[2:32:54.220 --> 2:32:57.220]  What else is on your mind, Landers?
[2:32:57.220 --> 2:33:02.220]  Well, Alex, I was thinking about your reporters now and I was thinking about some of those clips
[2:33:02.220 --> 2:33:08.220]  you play where you have the kind of pig like zombie people making noises into the microphones
[2:33:08.220 --> 2:33:09.220]  and shrieking.
[2:33:09.220 --> 2:33:15.220]  I just want everyone to think about the prodigal son because I want everyone to see, you know,
[2:33:15.220 --> 2:33:19.220]  the rioters, all these people as God's children, just like we are.
[2:33:19.220 --> 2:33:20.220]  I know.
[2:33:20.220 --> 2:33:23.220]  No, I agree with you because one of my main sins and God's touched my heart on this.
[2:33:23.220 --> 2:33:24.220]  I'm serious.
[2:33:24.220 --> 2:33:25.220]  I get 3 a.m.
[2:33:25.220 --> 2:33:27.220]  God's like, you shouldn't make fun of the left.
[2:33:27.220 --> 2:33:29.220]  You shouldn't make fun of how they've been turned into zombies.
[2:33:29.220 --> 2:33:30.220]  Now, devil worshipers go against them.
[2:33:30.220 --> 2:33:35.220]  Those that are conscious, but those that just go, I mean, that's somebody possessed.
[2:33:35.220 --> 2:33:39.220]  We should, we should be mourning over that person and trying to get them back.
[2:33:39.220 --> 2:33:40.220]  I agree.
[2:33:40.220 --> 2:33:41.220]  Pray for them.
[2:33:41.220 --> 2:33:46.220]  God wants them to stand up straight just like everyone else and feel the wind in their face.
[2:33:46.220 --> 2:33:48.220]  Stay Hosanna in the highest.
[2:33:48.220 --> 2:33:49.220]  Beautiful, Lander.
[2:33:49.220 --> 2:33:50.220]  All right.
[2:33:50.220 --> 2:33:51.220]  I'm going to get to everybody.
[2:33:51.220 --> 2:33:52.220]  Jose in Mexico.
[2:33:52.220 --> 2:33:53.220]  We're going to get to you next.
[2:33:53.220 --> 2:33:58.220]  We're going to go to Justin, George, Roger, Scott, Dwayne, Michael, Jeff.
[2:33:58.220 --> 2:33:59.220]  I got to get to everybody.
[2:33:59.220 --> 2:34:00.220]  Paul Watson's coming up.
[2:34:00.220 --> 2:34:04.220]  We're going to have Greg Reese from Cleveland coming up on the other side for a few minutes.
[2:34:04.220 --> 2:34:06.220]  He'll give us live coverage tonight.
[2:34:06.220 --> 2:34:07.220]  Tonight.
[2:34:07.220 --> 2:34:08.220]  Tonight.
[2:34:08.220 --> 2:34:09.220]  Tonight.
[2:34:09.220 --> 2:34:10.220]  It's the big debate night.
[2:34:10.220 --> 2:34:11.220]  And Paul wants live coverage.
[2:34:11.220 --> 2:34:12.220]  Do not share the links.
[2:34:12.220 --> 2:34:13.220]  Do not.
[2:34:13.220 --> 2:34:18.220]  You notice that over and over again, the United Nations are supposed controllers and bosses.
[2:34:18.220 --> 2:34:22.220]  The great arbiter of truth that no one's allowed to disagree with has come out and said,
[2:34:22.220 --> 2:34:26.220]  nothing can treat or prevent COVID-19.
[2:34:26.220 --> 2:34:28.220]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's the total lie.
[2:34:28.220 --> 2:34:29.220]  You get a lot of sunlight.
[2:34:29.220 --> 2:34:35.220]  It's on record to produce a ton of vitamin D3 and it's almost impossible to get viral
[2:34:35.220 --> 2:34:37.220]  infections when you're getting plenty of vitamin D3.
[2:34:37.220 --> 2:34:42.220]  If you have zinc and vitamin C as well, that's why people get the flus and these colds in
[2:34:42.220 --> 2:34:44.220]  the winter because that's when vitamin D levels plunge.
[2:34:44.220 --> 2:34:50.220]  Now I've pointed this out and the media has called me a scammer for saying that there's
[2:34:50.220 --> 2:34:52.220]  hope that people should have their vitamins and their minerals.
[2:34:52.220 --> 2:34:57.220]  Well, now Fauci has been forced to come out and admit that you need vitamin D3 and see
[2:34:57.220 --> 2:35:02.220]  he should have also added zinc because the NIH website says you die without zinc.
[2:35:02.220 --> 2:35:06.220]  But it's good news that he's being pressured now to admit the reality because so many doctors
[2:35:06.220 --> 2:35:10.220]  and nurses and experts in nutrition have been exposing the fact that he's not been
[2:35:10.220 --> 2:35:13.220]  warning the public to get their vitamins.
[2:35:13.220 --> 2:35:19.220]  Computer research scientists, engineers working with attorneys have conclusively proven and
[2:35:19.220 --> 2:35:25.220]  put out detailed reports at Tablet Magazine documenting what any trained eye could already
[2:35:25.220 --> 2:35:27.220]  see as plain as day.
[2:35:27.220 --> 2:35:32.220]  Communist Chinese working in tandem with the United Nations and the Democratic Party in
[2:35:32.220 --> 2:35:37.220]  the United States as well as the media put out fake videos and total hysteria to make
[2:35:37.220 --> 2:35:42.220]  it look like Day of the Dead into the world in China earlier this year.
[2:35:42.220 --> 2:35:47.220]  Then the UN put out standardized rules designed to keep the West locked down when China reopened
[2:35:47.220 --> 2:35:48.220]  within three months.
[2:35:48.220 --> 2:35:52.220]  This is the greatest strategic coup ever.
[2:35:52.220 --> 2:35:58.220]  This is 21st century warfare being carried out through psychological means or the ultimate
[2:35:58.220 --> 2:35:59.220]  sign up.
[2:35:59.220 --> 2:36:02.220]  Paul Joseph Watson has written about it at infowars.com.
[2:36:02.220 --> 2:36:06.220]  Myself Alex Jones, David I know and Troy are covering this heavily.
[2:36:06.220 --> 2:36:10.220]  This is the way to bring down the globalist is exposing how Communist China and the UN
[2:36:10.220 --> 2:36:14.220]  were behind the hysteria.
[2:36:14.220 --> 2:36:21.220]  Hello, my name is Dr. Fauci and I've been at the NIH and CDC for 45 years.
[2:36:21.220 --> 2:36:23.220]  I've overseen well.
[2:36:23.220 --> 2:36:30.220]  You know the AIDS pandemic and so many other things and I take my orders from Bill Gates,
[2:36:30.220 --> 2:36:31.220]  Dr. Bill Gates.
[2:36:31.220 --> 2:36:39.220]  I mean he's not a doctor but he controls everything you do and he now says you're going to take
[2:36:39.220 --> 2:36:45.220]  the shots and of course in England they are now saying what I told you you will not be
[2:36:45.220 --> 2:36:46.220]  allowed to travel.
[2:36:46.220 --> 2:36:50.220]  Leave your home until you take all the shots.
[2:36:50.220 --> 2:36:57.220]  Dr. Gates, I mean Bill Gates, your owner, your master says you will have to take four
[2:36:57.220 --> 2:37:06.220]  to five COVID shots a year for adult, two for baby, baby much more manageable just like
[2:37:06.220 --> 2:37:09.220]  Bill Gates give you polio and vaccine.
[2:37:09.220 --> 2:37:14.220]  I'm Dr. Fauci reminding you that we owe you.
[2:37:14.220 --> 2:37:21.220]  The Renaissance, the Great Enlightenment, it's all being swept away and being replaced by
[2:37:21.220 --> 2:37:30.220]  scientific tyranny that's establishing a form of planetary digital law where the technocrats
[2:37:30.220 --> 2:37:36.220]  are above the law and the public isn't even considered to be as valuable as a cow.
[2:37:36.220 --> 2:37:41.220]  In fact humans are seen as garbage that's going to be taken out and removed.
[2:37:41.220 --> 2:37:44.220]  That is the post-human exterminist plan.
[2:37:44.220 --> 2:37:49.220]  That is the public ideology of the globalists and everything they've built with this high-tech
[2:37:49.220 --> 2:37:58.220]  grid is to absorb us and anesthetize our minds as we're slowly killed and any future generations
[2:37:58.220 --> 2:38:03.220]  that happen to straggle out of their mother's wounds will be a mere shadow of what humans
[2:38:03.220 --> 2:38:04.220]  once were.
[2:38:04.220 --> 2:38:11.220]  This is the Satanic ruling elite engaged in mass vandalism against God's creation, humanity.
[2:38:11.220 --> 2:38:13.220]  This is the essence of evil.
[2:38:16.220 --> 2:38:20.220]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:38:20.220 --> 2:38:32.220]  We are back live.
[2:38:32.220 --> 2:38:34.220]  Your phone calls are coming up.
[2:38:34.220 --> 2:38:35.220]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson.
[2:38:35.220 --> 2:38:36.220]  I'm Alex Jones.
[2:38:36.220 --> 2:38:42.220]  It's the fabled day where the Crypt Keeper, Sleepy Joe, has to debate President Trump
[2:38:42.220 --> 2:38:46.220]  tonight, 8th to 930 Central, 9 to 1030 Eastern.
[2:38:46.220 --> 2:38:51.220]  We'll be covering it live at infowars.com.
[2:38:51.220 --> 2:38:57.220]  I'll be here at 6 p.m. and we're going to be commercial free taking your calls and special
[2:38:57.220 --> 2:39:00.220]  guests ahead of that.
[2:39:00.220 --> 2:39:01.220]  All right.
[2:39:01.220 --> 2:39:07.220]  There is Gregory's by the river walk there by the canal there in Cleveland where the
[2:39:07.220 --> 2:39:11.220]  site of the RNC in July four years ago.
[2:39:11.220 --> 2:39:13.220]  And wow, you're going to be there on the ground.
[2:39:13.220 --> 2:39:14.220]  What are you seeing?
[2:39:14.220 --> 2:39:17.220]  And if you're seeing BLM, what's the police presence?
[2:39:17.220 --> 2:39:19.220]  What are you expecting to see Gregory's?
[2:39:19.220 --> 2:39:22.220]  Well, so far we've seen a pretty strong police presence.
[2:39:22.220 --> 2:39:23.220]  The streets are empty.
[2:39:23.220 --> 2:39:24.220]  I grew up here.
[2:39:24.220 --> 2:39:26.220]  I've never seen the streets so empty.
[2:39:26.220 --> 2:39:28.220]  Everywhere we've been the streets seem empty.
[2:39:28.220 --> 2:39:29.220]  There's some traffic on the roads.
[2:39:29.220 --> 2:39:34.220]  There's a huge security perimeter put up around the debate venue.
[2:39:34.220 --> 2:39:38.220]  And there's really nowhere for anyone to form groups.
[2:39:38.220 --> 2:39:40.220]  There's everything's fenced off to the sidewalk to the street.
[2:39:40.220 --> 2:39:43.220]  So it's going to be interesting to see what happens later on.
[2:39:43.220 --> 2:39:47.220]  But other than that, I've just seen tons of signage everywhere for wear the mask and
[2:39:47.220 --> 2:39:49.220]  signs everywhere for wear the mask and wear the mask.
[2:39:49.220 --> 2:39:54.220]  And so Cleveland is caught up in the madness as much as any other place.
[2:39:54.220 --> 2:39:58.220]  And that's what's driving me the most crazy is all this masked up.
[2:39:58.220 --> 2:40:01.220]  You know, we're talking about October surprises.
[2:40:01.220 --> 2:40:02.220]  We're talking about debates.
[2:40:02.220 --> 2:40:04.220]  I can't even believe we're here for the debate.
[2:40:04.220 --> 2:40:08.220]  And you know, I'm about ready to see people start questioning Fauci.
[2:40:08.220 --> 2:40:09.220]  People start questioning Gates.
[2:40:09.220 --> 2:40:12.220]  I doubt we're going to hear anything like that tonight, but I'm very curious to see
[2:40:12.220 --> 2:40:13.220]  what we are going to hear.
[2:40:13.220 --> 2:40:17.220]  The questions released by zero hedge on the questions that Trump administration
[2:40:17.220 --> 2:40:19.220]  sent to the Biden are great questions.
[2:40:19.220 --> 2:40:22.220]  I wonder if we're going to hear those or if we're just going to hear nothing but
[2:40:22.220 --> 2:40:25.220]  New York Times tax returns.
[2:40:25.220 --> 2:40:28.220]  No, just savage him.
[2:40:28.220 --> 2:40:32.220]  And not just go out for the bariz most stuff or things like that, but just
[2:40:32.220 --> 2:40:35.220]  just point out you presided over the destruction of this country.
[2:40:35.220 --> 2:40:38.220]  And what would you ask by that's a good question.
[2:40:38.220 --> 2:40:41.220]  We're going to exist o'clock when I'm hosting for hours.
[2:40:41.220 --> 2:40:45.220]  We're going to ask callers what what they think Trump should do.
[2:40:45.220 --> 2:40:49.220]  I thought the best question so far that I've heard is Hunter Biden, except receiving
[2:40:49.220 --> 2:40:54.220]  the money from the woman from Moscow receiving the money working with the
[2:40:54.220 --> 2:40:55.220]  Chinese government.
[2:40:55.220 --> 2:40:59.220]  These seem to be incredible questions when you look at what we've been dealing
[2:40:59.220 --> 2:41:03.220]  with for the past four years on talks of a Russia collusion and what we've been
[2:41:03.220 --> 2:41:04.220]  dealing with with China.
[2:41:04.220 --> 2:41:06.220]  These would be amazing questions to ask.
[2:41:06.220 --> 2:41:11.220]  I would also love to hear questions asked about Ilhan Omar and Project Veritas
[2:41:11.220 --> 2:41:14.220]  voter fraud voter fraud in the state of Texas.
[2:41:14.220 --> 2:41:16.220]  These are all great questions.
[2:41:16.220 --> 2:41:22.220]  I also recently saw a picture of AOC with the Chinese spy who worked for NYPD seemed
[2:41:22.220 --> 2:41:26.220]  all buddy buddy at a party and this whole radical element of Kamala Harris and the
[2:41:26.220 --> 2:41:28.220]  squad that seemed to be behind Joe Biden.
[2:41:28.220 --> 2:41:32.220]  I would go after him first and foremost saying you said quote we need China involved
[2:41:32.220 --> 2:41:36.220]  in every aspect of politics and sports in our daily lives.
[2:41:36.220 --> 2:41:40.220]  You and your son are on the on the on the payroll of communist China.
[2:41:40.220 --> 2:41:43.220]  Yeah, there's AOC with the ChaiCom agent.
[2:41:43.220 --> 2:41:46.220]  Wow, this is just getting crazy, isn't it?
[2:41:46.220 --> 2:41:48.220]  Absolutely crazy and crazy every day someone.
[2:41:48.220 --> 2:41:50.220]  A lot of people have been asking me about October surprises.
[2:41:50.220 --> 2:41:54.220]  What do I think about an October surprise and I can't help but shake my head like
[2:41:54.220 --> 2:41:57.220]  every every few weeks we have an October surprise in 2020.
[2:41:57.220 --> 2:42:00.220]  It's just one thing after the next one thing after the next.
[2:42:00.220 --> 2:42:05.220]  And once again, there seems to be no end in sight for this whole mask phony COVID thing
[2:42:05.220 --> 2:42:10.220]  and people are just going along with it 100%.
[2:42:10.220 --> 2:42:12.220]  It's unbelievable.
[2:42:12.220 --> 2:42:17.220]  But tonight, hopefully we'll the president will have an opportunity to actually debate Joe
[2:42:17.220 --> 2:42:20.220]  Biden and like you said, just savage him.
[2:42:20.220 --> 2:42:24.220]  We know I wonder if Biden is going to wear his mask and if Trump walks too close,
[2:42:24.220 --> 2:42:25.220]  he'll do that.
[2:42:25.220 --> 2:42:27.220]  Stay back six feet crap.
[2:42:27.220 --> 2:42:30.220]  Well, we were to we heard, I don't know if it's going to go through,
[2:42:30.220 --> 2:42:32.220]  but we heard that they have a rule that there's no masks on stage.
[2:42:32.220 --> 2:42:35.220]  So what we heard is that neither one of them are going to be allowed to wear a mask.
[2:42:35.220 --> 2:42:39.220]  I think we also heard that Joe Biden was challenged to have a test for an earpiece
[2:42:39.220 --> 2:42:41.220]  that he agreed to days ago.
[2:42:41.220 --> 2:42:45.220]  But today there are rumors that he's now refusing to be tested for an earpiece.
[2:42:45.220 --> 2:42:49.220]  He refused to be tested for drugs, which I thought was kind of funny.
[2:42:49.220 --> 2:42:53.220]  Obviously, they're shooting him up with methamphetamine with him walking,
[2:42:53.220 --> 2:42:57.220]  which again is emblematic of the globalist being so arrogant, so crazy.
[2:42:57.220 --> 2:43:01.220]  All right, we're going to be checking in with you guys tonight at about 7 p.m.
[2:43:01.220 --> 2:43:03.220]  Right in front of the convention center there.
[2:43:03.220 --> 2:43:06.220]  And we're going to be talking to you and we'll talk to you after the event.
[2:43:06.220 --> 2:43:08.220]  I know you're going to have live feeds and things breaking.
[2:43:08.220 --> 2:43:10.220]  You call us the minute something happens.
[2:43:10.220 --> 2:43:11.220]  We'll get you on air.
[2:43:11.220 --> 2:43:14.220]  Gregory's great job there.
[2:43:14.220 --> 2:43:19.220]  There goes Gregory's on the ground in Cleveland, Ohio with our team.
[2:43:19.220 --> 2:43:23.220]  Now let's start getting to your calls because Paul Joseph Watson is coming up,
[2:43:23.220 --> 2:43:25.220]  but then it's going to be commercial free.
[2:43:25.220 --> 2:43:27.220]  Again, we're going to hear a few promos here and there for breaks,
[2:43:27.220 --> 2:43:32.220]  but six minutes breaks an hour tonight, 6 p.m. baby, it's going to be big.
[2:43:32.220 --> 2:43:36.220]  And if you spread the live links and say here's live coverage of the debate,

[2:43:37.220 --> 2:43:39.220]  Watch it here with key analysis.
[2:43:39.220 --> 2:43:40.220]  It's going to just chain reaction.

[2:43:42.220 --> 2:43:43.220]  Alex Jones is back.
[2:43:43.220 --> 2:43:45.220]  The forbidden information is on live.
[2:43:45.220 --> 2:43:49.220]  That's what causes the chain reaction.
[2:43:49.220 --> 2:43:51.220]  It pisses off Google and Facebook and the chai comms so much live coverage.
[2:43:51.220 --> 2:43:53.220]  Trump versus Biden, the main event.
[2:43:53.220 --> 2:43:54.220]  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

[2:44:19.220 --> 2:44:20.220]  Hello, Alex.
[2:44:20.220 --> 2:44:21.220]  Welcome, sir.
[2:44:21.220 --> 2:44:22.220]  I'm right here in Mexico.
[2:44:22.220 --> 2:44:24.220]  I've been here for the past eight years.
[2:44:24.220 --> 2:44:27.220]  I spoke with you before you invited me to one of the podcasts.
[2:44:27.220 --> 2:44:28.220]  Yes, sir.
[2:44:28.220 --> 2:44:30.220]  We're yet to do it, but we're going to start that soon.
[2:44:30.220 --> 2:44:31.220]  God bless you.
[2:44:31.220 --> 2:44:32.220]  You're on the air.
[2:44:32.220 --> 2:44:33.220]  Thank you, sir.
[2:44:33.220 --> 2:44:36.220]  Well, I'm just here, you know, I want to volunteer.
[2:44:36.220 --> 2:44:38.220]  I want to do something for the movement.
[2:44:38.220 --> 2:44:41.220]  I've been doing videos, but I feel like there's more that I can do first.
[2:44:41.220 --> 2:44:43.220]  So I just want to make myself available.
[2:44:43.220 --> 2:44:45.220]  What can I do from Mexico?
[2:44:45.220 --> 2:44:49.220]  Well, brother, you can shoot all sorts of videos and put out any website.
[2:44:49.220 --> 2:44:50.220]  You want to promote them.
[2:44:50.220 --> 2:44:51.220]  I'm a small operation.
[2:44:51.220 --> 2:44:52.220]  We reach a lot of people.
[2:44:52.220 --> 2:44:53.220]  But what do you think you should do?
[2:44:53.220 --> 2:44:55.220]  You're calling into a talk show right now.
[2:44:55.220 --> 2:44:57.220]  What do you, what do you think about the COVID lockdown?
[2:44:57.220 --> 2:45:00.220]  How is the COVID lockdown in Mexico?
[2:45:00.220 --> 2:45:02.220]  Lockdown people out where I'm mad.
[2:45:02.220 --> 2:45:04.220]  I mean, you can send Mexico server here people on lockdown.
[2:45:04.220 --> 2:45:07.220]  I mean, it's extreme here and people are afraid of the government.
[2:45:07.220 --> 2:45:10.220]  I go out and ask people, how come you don't go out and protest?
[2:45:10.220 --> 2:45:11.220]  And the answer is always the same.
[2:45:11.220 --> 2:45:13.220]  They're afraid of the government.
[2:45:13.220 --> 2:45:14.220]  They're afraid of the police.
[2:45:14.220 --> 2:45:18.220]  And I know what Jefferson said, you know, um, when people are afraid of the government,
[2:45:18.220 --> 2:45:19.220]  there's tyranny.
[2:45:19.220 --> 2:45:21.220]  That's exactly what we're experiencing here.
[2:45:21.220 --> 2:45:22.220]  No, I agree.
[2:45:22.220 --> 2:45:23.220]  This is a worldwide lockdown.
[2:45:23.220 --> 2:45:26.220]  So, so how are folks doing financially under lockdown?
[2:45:26.220 --> 2:45:27.220]  Not well, I would imagine.
[2:45:27.220 --> 2:45:31.220]  Oh, no, no, there's, there's protests going on in downtown because, um, you know,
[2:45:31.220 --> 2:45:35.220]  people aren't able to work, but they've closed downtown to report, you know, poor people,
[2:45:35.220 --> 2:45:37.220]  people without vehicles are unable to get to downtown.
[2:45:37.220 --> 2:45:41.220]  Those are the people that are being affected the most.
[2:45:41.220 --> 2:45:44.220]  And, um, you know, that's something that's been happening, but there's been people that
[2:45:44.220 --> 2:45:47.220]  have been getting arrested for being out there and protesting.
[2:45:47.220 --> 2:45:51.220]  Uh, they're, they're not even allowing people to work out on the street.
[2:45:51.220 --> 2:45:52.220]  You can even go out for a jog.
[2:45:52.220 --> 2:45:54.220]  You know, police are telling people.
[2:45:54.220 --> 2:45:57.220]  No, no, governments everywhere are using this as a giant power grab.
[2:45:57.220 --> 2:45:58.220]  Jose, God bless you.
[2:45:58.220 --> 2:45:59.220]  And we love you, sir.
[2:45:59.220 --> 2:46:00.220]  Thank you so much.
[2:46:00.220 --> 2:46:03.220]  We got a big list of people that I want to start doing a weekly talk show with.
[2:46:03.220 --> 2:46:04.220]  I've done it a few times.
[2:46:04.220 --> 2:46:05.220]  I just get busy.
[2:46:05.220 --> 2:46:09.220]  I get, I get, but we're, we're getting more board ops, more producers.
[2:46:09.220 --> 2:46:14.220]  So that we can, um, do more of those shows will hire a couple of people than one person
[2:46:14.220 --> 2:46:15.220]  quits.
[2:46:15.220 --> 2:46:18.220]  We hire a couple of people and Glenn Beck hires one of them, which is okay.
[2:46:18.220 --> 2:46:19.220]  That's just the way media works.
[2:46:19.220 --> 2:46:20.220]  We got to train folks.
[2:46:20.220 --> 2:46:21.220]  We're like the little league.
[2:46:21.220 --> 2:46:24.220]  You know, even though we have a bigger audience than Glenn Beck, he's like God.
[2:46:24.220 --> 2:46:27.220]  He's up there at the mountain and it, you know, it's okay.
[2:46:27.220 --> 2:46:28.220]  That's what we do.
[2:46:28.220 --> 2:46:31.220]  Uh, it's just that it's hard to get the crew to do more shows.
[2:46:31.220 --> 2:46:32.220]  We're trying as hard as we can.
[2:46:32.220 --> 2:46:34.220]  That's all I need your financial support.
[2:46:34.220 --> 2:46:35.220]  Okay.
[2:46:35.220 --> 2:46:41.220]  It's one of the longest now that would be, um, DeWayne and then JB and then Justin and
[2:46:41.220 --> 2:46:42.220]  George and others.
[2:46:42.220 --> 2:46:43.220]  Go ahead.
[2:46:43.220 --> 2:46:44.220]  DeWayne and Delaware.
[2:46:44.220 --> 2:46:45.220]  You're on the air.
[2:46:45.220 --> 2:46:46.220]  Hey, Alex.
[2:46:46.220 --> 2:46:47.220]  Thanks for all your hard work.
[2:46:47.220 --> 2:46:48.220]  Let me say that to start off.
[2:46:48.220 --> 2:46:49.220]  Thank you, brother.
[2:46:49.220 --> 2:46:50.220]  My name is Dwayne from Delaware.
[2:46:50.220 --> 2:46:51.220]  I'm a keyboardist for the show.
[2:46:51.220 --> 2:46:52.220]  I'm an attack and a religion.
[2:46:52.220 --> 2:46:53.220]  It's kind of my thing.
[2:46:53.220 --> 2:46:58.060]  I study a lot of religion and philosophy and, uh, the convidians and their precautions
[2:46:58.060 --> 2:47:00.220]  and their mannerisms and all this fire.
[2:47:00.220 --> 2:47:05.220]  Actually has a historical precedent from third century.
[2:47:05.220 --> 2:47:08.220]  There's a philosophy named Manny who started a group with a man of genes.
[2:47:08.220 --> 2:47:11.220]  They were like an early attempt at, uh, globalism.
[2:47:11.220 --> 2:47:14.220]  Um, they're made famous by Augustine's confession.
[2:47:14.220 --> 2:47:18.220]  Well, the man of genes had this thing where they would do, everybody had to wear veils
[2:47:18.220 --> 2:47:21.220]  and masks and they had to virtue signal each other and report each other.
[2:47:21.220 --> 2:47:24.220]  Whenever somebody was breaking free of the man of genes faith.
[2:47:24.220 --> 2:47:29.220]  Um, some of the things I heard of that, that's why they predicted like a weird global religious
[2:47:29.220 --> 2:47:32.220]  cult where you have to wear a mask for men and women beyond Islam.
[2:47:32.220 --> 2:47:33.220]  Guys, look that up.
[2:47:33.220 --> 2:47:34.220]  I forgot about that.
[2:47:34.220 --> 2:47:35.220]  The man of teens.
[2:47:35.220 --> 2:47:36.220]  That's wild.
[2:47:36.220 --> 2:47:37.220]  Yeah.
[2:47:37.220 --> 2:47:41.220]  And they, and they start, and they're from the attorney's knees and the Iranians, uh,
[2:47:41.220 --> 2:47:42.220]  pre-Islam.
[2:47:42.220 --> 2:47:46.220]  And one of the version signal and things they'd have is they'd have an idol in the middle
[2:47:46.220 --> 2:47:50.220]  of their public areas and people would go up and they would OBS, you know, they would,
[2:47:50.220 --> 2:47:53.220]  they would sit, they would sit, they would like kneel and supplicate almost like the
[2:47:53.220 --> 2:47:54.220]  BLM kneeling.
[2:47:54.220 --> 2:47:59.220]  And they would take from the statue, this, um, sanitizing solution called the Gomez.
[2:47:59.220 --> 2:48:03.220]  And the Gomez is a big feature of, uh, Zoroastrian thought.
[2:48:03.220 --> 2:48:07.220]  Well, the Gomez would have to be received in public and people would virtue signal each
[2:48:07.220 --> 2:48:08.220]  other to do this sort of thing.
[2:48:08.220 --> 2:48:11.220]  And then if they weren't doing it, they were brought into our,
[2:48:11.220 --> 2:48:14.220]  I remember hearing about a Zoroastrian cult or mask.
[2:48:14.220 --> 2:48:16.220]  I don't remember the name man of teens.
[2:48:16.220 --> 2:48:17.220]  Uh,
[2:48:17.220 --> 2:48:18.220]  No, they were teens after Manning.
[2:48:18.220 --> 2:48:21.220]  Manning was the philosopher and started hanging on.
[2:48:21.220 --> 2:48:24.220]  I know your phone's really, really fluctuating.
[2:48:24.220 --> 2:48:25.220]  Spell it out for me.
[2:48:25.220 --> 2:48:29.220]  M-A-N-I-C-H-A-E-N-S.
[2:48:29.220 --> 2:48:30.220]  Okay.
[2:48:30.220 --> 2:48:31.220]  I'm going to look that up.
[2:48:31.220 --> 2:48:32.220]  That's crazy.
[2:48:32.220 --> 2:48:33.220]  Yeah.
[2:48:33.220 --> 2:48:37.220]  And, and they, and, um, this, this, this group has persevered through a lot of the ancient
[2:48:37.220 --> 2:48:38.220]  traditions.
[2:48:38.220 --> 2:48:43.220]  And, uh, you know, like, like, like, like the author Blvdavsky once said, one truth could
[2:48:43.220 --> 2:48:44.220]  take that amount of lives.
[2:48:44.220 --> 2:48:49.220]  Well, the Psyop going on right now is absolutely modeled after the Manichians that are.
[2:48:49.220 --> 2:48:53.220]  Manichians. Well, this lie is definitely bringing down civilization and those that are the
[2:48:53.220 --> 2:48:55.220]  put ones pushing it need to pay.
[2:48:55.220 --> 2:48:56.220]  I hear your brother powerful call.
[2:48:56.220 --> 2:48:57.220]  More calls straight ahead.
[2:48:57.220 --> 2:48:58.220]  Hour number four.
[2:48:58.220 --> 2:49:27.220]  And then it's debate time tonight.
[2:49:27.220 --> 2:49:36.540]  This is the most common way that the Salatarians take over, but there then becomes a point
[2:49:36.540 --> 2:49:40.320]  where the public wakes up under the incrementalism.
[2:49:40.320 --> 2:49:43.940]  He starts resisting and then there's usually a giant purge and a clampdown.
[2:49:43.940 --> 2:49:48.220]  And you'll see more tyranny rolled out in just a few days, weeks or months that you
[2:49:48.220 --> 2:49:49.220]  saw in the previous 10 years.
[2:49:49.220 --> 2:49:53.220]  And that's the period we're in globally right now.
[2:49:53.220 --> 2:49:58.860]  A world government, chai combat, globalist corporate takeover of the planet that wants
[2:49:58.860 --> 2:50:04.860]  you poor and absolutely sick under their thumb forever.
[2:50:04.860 --> 2:50:09.260]  The globalists are very, very honest about their planetary goals.
[2:50:09.260 --> 2:50:16.580]  They want private corporate governance, above nation states, above religious institutions,
[2:50:16.580 --> 2:50:17.980]  above the family.
[2:50:17.980 --> 2:50:20.180]  They want total corporate power.
[2:50:20.180 --> 2:50:25.980]  There was a great film back in the early 1970s called Roller Ball with James Cahn.
[2:50:25.980 --> 2:50:30.180]  It's based on a novel set in the year 2020.
[2:50:30.180 --> 2:50:34.340]  And in the book, you have mega corporations that control the planet, and there are no
[2:50:34.340 --> 2:50:36.780]  longer nation states.
[2:50:36.780 --> 2:50:40.780]  There are only cities that are the capitals of the corporations.
[2:50:40.780 --> 2:50:46.180]  If you actually read what the most group of the CFR and the Rural Commission say in the
[2:50:46.180 --> 2:50:48.820]  year 2020, that is their in game.
[2:50:48.820 --> 2:50:50.300]  That is their goal.
[2:50:50.300 --> 2:50:55.340]  So we're talking about a hunger games type scenario here run by very, very, very ruthless
[2:50:55.340 --> 2:50:57.340]  people to see us as shadow.
[2:50:57.340 --> 2:51:02.100]  They're using COVID-19 as their takeover strategy, and Communist China as their model.
[2:51:02.100 --> 2:51:07.300]  We must reject it now.
[2:51:07.300 --> 2:51:11.300]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:51:11.300 --> 2:51:19.300]  All right, we're almost out of time, Paul Watson is taking over on his major calls.
[2:51:19.300 --> 2:51:20.300]  It's possible.
[2:51:20.300 --> 2:51:23.140]  We've got a lot of key breaking news I haven't gotten to yet.
[2:51:23.140 --> 2:51:27.540]  I'll hit briefly before Paul Watson takes over in the war room, and I'll be back myself
[2:51:27.540 --> 2:51:31.020]  six o'clock, right through the debates, taking your calls.
[2:51:31.020 --> 2:51:34.580]  It'll be commercial free, so I get to five times as many calls as I can get to all the
[2:51:34.580 --> 2:51:35.580]  guests.
[2:51:35.580 --> 2:51:38.620]  It's going to be amazing transmission tonight with the live coverage of the debate.
[2:51:38.620 --> 2:51:42.660]  We'll take the feed here from the satellites, so you'll want to join us.
[2:51:42.660 --> 2:51:44.340]  Let's go to JB in Vegas.
[2:51:44.340 --> 2:51:45.340]  JB, thanks for holding.
[2:51:45.340 --> 2:51:46.340]  Hello, Alex.
[2:51:46.340 --> 2:51:47.340]  How you doing?
[2:51:47.340 --> 2:51:52.460]  Man, I'll be honest with you, God's holding me up, but behind the scenes, the devil's
[2:51:52.460 --> 2:51:54.660]  really coming after me, brother.
[2:51:54.660 --> 2:51:55.660]  You know why?
[2:51:55.660 --> 2:51:58.340]  Because the whole world is upside down right now.
[2:51:58.340 --> 2:52:00.340]  Yes, sir.
[2:52:00.340 --> 2:52:05.860]  And plus everybody, the Democrats, they are the dangerous tongue, and they are the beast
[2:52:05.860 --> 2:52:08.860]  that God told us to look out for.
[2:52:08.860 --> 2:52:09.860]  I agree, brother.
[2:52:09.860 --> 2:52:10.860]  What do you think is coming down?
[2:52:10.860 --> 2:52:15.740]  Well, what I think coming down is that people are going to wake up and see that they are
[2:52:15.740 --> 2:52:21.820]  minding just the white sheet of paper, and that the tongue is a pin of the ready rail.
[2:52:21.820 --> 2:52:27.780]  And anything that you have that comes to your brain is a receiving and broadcasting system
[2:52:27.780 --> 2:52:29.660]  of the human being.
[2:52:29.660 --> 2:52:30.660]  Humanity.
[2:52:30.660 --> 2:52:34.220]  I love the way you talk about humanity and human rights.
[2:52:34.220 --> 2:52:42.820]  Man, once they got that to go in program and let people know that their body blinded, their
[2:52:42.820 --> 2:52:48.020]  mind is blinded, they have a mind in it, and you have a dead mind, throw that out all the
[2:52:48.020 --> 2:52:52.740]  news that Trump talk about that, man, tyranny will run.
[2:52:52.740 --> 2:52:53.740]  I agree.
[2:52:53.740 --> 2:52:56.020]  Trump can just talk about the great awakening.
[2:52:56.020 --> 2:52:57.020]  You're right.
[2:52:57.020 --> 2:53:01.420]  You're going to reveal the falseness of the lies, of the globalists.
[2:53:01.420 --> 2:53:05.140]  No, but you're right, because people can have smarts, but if they're spiritually dead,
[2:53:05.140 --> 2:53:06.140]  they're dumb.
[2:53:06.140 --> 2:53:07.140]  I agree, sir.
[2:53:07.140 --> 2:53:09.740]  What do you think is going to happen tonight?
[2:53:09.740 --> 2:53:13.300]  You're saying people are going to find out that just Biden is just a, he, I agree with
[2:53:13.300 --> 2:53:14.300]  you.
[2:53:14.300 --> 2:53:15.300]  He's like a white piece of paper.
[2:53:15.300 --> 2:53:16.300]  There's nothing there.
[2:53:16.300 --> 2:53:17.300]  That's why they want him because he's nobody.
[2:53:17.300 --> 2:53:18.300]  He's a nothing.
[2:53:18.300 --> 2:53:20.900]  I agree with you, sir.
[2:53:20.900 --> 2:53:21.900]  And this is required.
[2:53:21.900 --> 2:53:24.220]  It's called the dangerous tongue of people.
[2:53:24.220 --> 2:53:28.420]  See, they can speak to a white piece of paper, but they put in dangerous words, dangerous
[2:53:28.420 --> 2:53:29.420]  activities.
[2:53:29.420 --> 2:53:33.100]  They put in a twisted minded people that who has dangerous thoughts.
[2:53:33.100 --> 2:53:34.100]  And guess what?
[2:53:34.100 --> 2:53:37.260]  We all made of oxygen, liquid and gas.
[2:53:37.260 --> 2:53:40.860]  We all will be the same air in this mass thing, man.
[2:53:40.860 --> 2:53:46.820]  Only thing I can see about them is this destroy the machine that makes it the same way with
[2:53:46.820 --> 2:53:50.820]  the, the strength and the injection thing.
[2:53:50.820 --> 2:53:51.820]  Those are the machine.
[2:53:51.820 --> 2:53:54.780]  It could attack real quick as far as to know, I agree.
[2:53:54.780 --> 2:53:57.900]  They had the people that were for getting rid of all the alcohol and they would go and
[2:53:57.900 --> 2:54:00.740]  actually attack the liquors, the bottles, the actual alcohol.
[2:54:00.740 --> 2:54:01.740]  That's how you do it.
[2:54:01.740 --> 2:54:04.940]  I'm not saying go attack the mass, making machines, folks, but instead of killing each
[2:54:04.940 --> 2:54:08.260]  other in the streets, we have something about who's behind it, going to the source if we're
[2:54:08.260 --> 2:54:10.340]  going to get violent, which I'm not going for yet.
[2:54:10.340 --> 2:54:13.500]  I'm just saying, please, folks, they're going to try to stage violence where blacks and
[2:54:13.500 --> 2:54:17.180]  whites kill each other for no reason while the technocrats play us off against each other.
[2:54:17.180 --> 2:54:18.700]  God bless you, JB.
[2:54:18.700 --> 2:54:20.220]  Great points from Vegas.
[2:54:20.220 --> 2:54:21.220]  Justin in Wisconsin.
[2:54:21.220 --> 2:54:22.220]  Go ahead, Justin.
[2:54:22.220 --> 2:54:23.220]  You're on the air.
[2:54:23.220 --> 2:54:24.420]  Hey, Alex.
[2:54:24.420 --> 2:54:27.380]  I got something really big to talk to you about.
[2:54:27.380 --> 2:54:29.740]  First of all, I want to say I love you and I pray for you every day.
[2:54:29.740 --> 2:54:31.740]  Thank you.
[2:54:31.740 --> 2:54:37.700]  So this morning, I got a call from a Democratic pollster about doing some work for them in
[2:54:37.700 --> 2:54:44.780]  the polls, sorting ballots, watching the polls, and moving ballots.
[2:54:44.780 --> 2:54:51.820]  It just drew a red flag with me and I'm wondering, and they want to pay me.
[2:54:51.820 --> 2:54:57.340]  That's the weird part because in Wisconsin, you don't get paid for doing that.
[2:54:57.340 --> 2:54:58.460]  It's all volunteer.
[2:54:58.460 --> 2:55:02.300]  So I want to know what you think I should do to infiltrate and find out what's going
[2:55:02.300 --> 2:55:03.300]  on.
[2:55:03.300 --> 2:55:05.900]  I think you 100% should go volunteer and watch everything going on, brother.
[2:55:05.900 --> 2:55:06.900]  That's your instinct.
[2:55:06.900 --> 2:55:07.900]  Yes, sir.
[2:55:07.900 --> 2:55:08.900]  Yes, sir.
[2:55:08.900 --> 2:55:09.900]  Yes, sir.
[2:55:09.900 --> 2:55:10.900]  To you.
[2:55:10.900 --> 2:55:13.020]  What do you think is going to unfold tonight in this debate?
[2:55:13.020 --> 2:55:16.340]  I think, I think, I think Joe is going to be crushed.
[2:55:16.340 --> 2:55:20.460]  I think he's going to be hopped up on meth or some kind of form of amphetamine, something
[2:55:20.460 --> 2:55:21.460]  to keep him going.
[2:55:21.460 --> 2:55:22.820]  And I don't think it's going to last.
[2:55:22.820 --> 2:55:26.100]  I think he's Trump's going to crush him.
[2:55:26.100 --> 2:55:27.100]  I agree with you.
[2:55:27.100 --> 2:55:30.220]  This is like the, I mean, forget Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier.
[2:55:30.220 --> 2:55:36.100]  Those are important boxing matches or the Dallas Cowboys versus the, this is a real
[2:55:36.100 --> 2:55:37.100]  deal here.
[2:55:37.100 --> 2:55:38.100]  I mean, this is important.
[2:55:38.100 --> 2:55:41.380]  This is, because this is a real, this is a real president versus the globalists.
[2:55:41.380 --> 2:55:43.100]  I don't like two puppets like it usually is.
[2:55:43.100 --> 2:55:44.260]  This is going to be crazy.
[2:55:44.260 --> 2:55:45.260]  God bless you, brother.
[2:55:45.260 --> 2:55:46.260]  All right.
[2:55:46.260 --> 2:55:49.340]  Listen, Michael, George and Roger, I'm taking some of Watson's time because I promised to
[2:55:49.340 --> 2:55:50.340]  get to you and I love you.
[2:55:50.340 --> 2:55:51.340]  And I want to hear what you have to say.
[2:55:51.340 --> 2:55:54.180]  But we're going to write to you when we come back in 60 seconds.
[2:55:54.180 --> 2:55:59.620]  And then we've also got this other news, Minnesota GOP representative Steve Drys recounts why
[2:55:59.620 --> 2:56:03.700]  he went to James O'Keeffe's, the FBI would do nothing with the videos they already had.
[2:56:03.700 --> 2:56:04.700]  Wow.
[2:56:04.700 --> 2:56:08.740]  So the good Somali stand up and expose the bad stuff and the FBI did nothing.
[2:56:08.740 --> 2:56:12.300]  Shame on the FBI director.
[2:56:12.300 --> 2:56:15.660]  Are you sick and tired of your calm, peaceful life?
[2:56:15.660 --> 2:56:17.660]  Are you sleeping too well at night?
[2:56:17.660 --> 2:56:21.380]  Is your city too safe?
[2:56:21.380 --> 2:56:23.380]  Well, not anymore.
[2:56:23.380 --> 2:56:28.140]  We're producing Democrats, politicians so incompetent they'll fill your neighborhood
[2:56:28.140 --> 2:56:34.460]  with riots, looting, rampant violence and even homelessness.
[2:56:34.460 --> 2:56:39.460]  The secret is a special blend of corruption and good old fashioned stupidity.
[2:56:39.460 --> 2:56:41.900]  No more pesky law and order.
[2:56:41.900 --> 2:56:45.780]  When Democrats are in charge, nobody's safe.
[2:56:45.780 --> 2:56:50.380]  Simply vote for Democrats, sit back and watch your neighborhood burn to the ground.
[2:56:50.380 --> 2:56:56.660]  But wait, vote for Democrats now and they'll include rolling blackouts, election fraud,
[2:56:56.660 --> 2:57:16.780]  cancel culture, taxes and more taxes, Democrats bringing chaos right to your front door.
[2:57:16.780 --> 2:57:21.780]  Live coverage tonight, six to midnight.
[2:57:21.780 --> 2:57:26.900]  Oh, it's the first big debate between Donald, Don Trump and Joe Biden.
[2:57:26.900 --> 2:57:29.420]  We'll have live coverage of it and the debate.
[2:57:29.420 --> 2:57:31.100]  Be sure to spread those links.
[2:57:31.100 --> 2:57:32.900]  Big brother hopes you won't.
[2:57:32.900 --> 2:57:38.140]  2020ElectionCenter.com will have it right there, front and center as the featured video.
[2:57:38.140 --> 2:57:40.500]  And of course, M4Wars.com forward slash show.
[2:57:40.500 --> 2:57:46.180]  Let's take three final calls for Paul Joseph Watson from his Britannic Majesty's England
[2:57:46.180 --> 2:57:47.180]  text over.
[2:57:47.180 --> 2:57:49.740]  Let's go ahead and go to Michael in Florida.
[2:57:49.740 --> 2:57:50.740]  You're on the air.
[2:57:50.740 --> 2:57:54.820]  Hi, Alex, long time listener, first time caller.
[2:57:54.820 --> 2:57:56.620]  God bless you for all your efforts.
[2:57:56.620 --> 2:57:57.620]  Thank you.
[2:57:57.620 --> 2:58:05.700]  I am a Fort Lauderdale resident and recently had a police incident in my property where
[2:58:05.700 --> 2:58:12.380]  two drug praise women called the police on me and tried to get me set up for fraud.
[2:58:12.380 --> 2:58:16.500]  And I beat the charge because I was calm.
[2:58:16.500 --> 2:58:22.860]  My landlord is an awesome guy with cameras everywhere and they got the charges.
[2:58:22.860 --> 2:58:27.940]  And I'm after this call, I'll be going down to the police department to get the restraining
[2:58:27.940 --> 2:58:30.700]  order to forcefully evict this person.
[2:58:30.700 --> 2:58:37.140]  Now this is just a micro chasm of what I'm doing in my neighborhood, but I have bigger
[2:58:37.140 --> 2:58:43.460]  things going on and I have totally focused on the globalist situation.
[2:58:43.460 --> 2:58:47.420]  I used to work for the Rothschilds at Merrill Lynch Bank.
[2:58:47.420 --> 2:58:49.380]  I know the culture.
[2:58:49.380 --> 2:58:51.620]  You've nailed it right on the head.
[2:58:51.620 --> 2:58:54.540]  I was a paratrooper in 82nd Airborne.
[2:58:54.540 --> 2:58:59.740]  And although I was a pawn, pawns see the movement of other pieces on the board.
[2:58:59.740 --> 2:59:05.100]  And let me tell you, sir, you're nailing it right on the head with almost 95% accuracy
[2:59:05.100 --> 2:59:08.620]  far higher than any credited news station out there.
[2:59:08.620 --> 2:59:10.140]  And I want to say, God bless you.
[2:59:10.140 --> 2:59:12.900]  Well, we love you, brother, but I'll tell you, nothing against women in general, but
[2:59:12.900 --> 2:59:15.820]  just in general, they're teaching people to bear false witness.
[2:59:15.820 --> 2:59:16.820]  There's massive amounts.
[2:59:16.820 --> 2:59:19.340]  You see the Brad Pars kill thing where the police just tackling.
[2:59:19.340 --> 2:59:20.340]  He's doing nothing.
[2:59:20.340 --> 2:59:21.340]  He's like, oh, how are you doing?
[2:59:21.340 --> 2:59:22.740]  They just physically attacking.
[2:59:22.740 --> 2:59:23.900]  That's criminal.
[2:59:23.900 --> 2:59:26.860]  Just like you should tackle a cop for no reason, you know.
[2:59:26.860 --> 2:59:31.120]  But we have a very interesting position going on here in Fort Lauderdale.
[2:59:31.120 --> 2:59:37.180]  We have ousted our corrupt police commissioner and who have a new replacement.
[2:59:37.180 --> 2:59:41.260]  Her name is Karen Dietrich, and she's doing a fabulous job.
[2:59:41.260 --> 2:59:43.500]  And she's turning this stuff around.
[2:59:43.500 --> 2:59:48.020]  I promise you, Alex, I would not be on this call if that wasn't true.
[2:59:48.020 --> 2:59:51.940]  I have even emailed you to back up some of my information with brother.
[2:59:51.940 --> 2:59:52.940]  That's beautiful.
[2:59:52.940 --> 2:59:53.940]  Call me back again.
[2:59:53.940 --> 2:59:57.300]  I've got to get Paul Watson in here and just a minute or two.
[2:59:57.300 --> 2:59:58.380]  In fact, I'm going to do it.
[2:59:58.380 --> 3:00:00.940]  I'll be back at six.
[3:00:00.940 --> 3:00:03.160]  If George and Roger are there, John, you're going to be here.
[3:00:03.160 --> 3:00:04.660]  Make sure we call them first as a caller.
[3:00:04.660 --> 3:00:08.020]  I'm going to take calls at 6 p.m. tonight after the war room and the two hours leading
[3:00:08.020 --> 3:00:10.020]  up to the debate, live coverage.
[3:00:10.020 --> 3:00:12.020]  But Paul Joseph Watson is about to take over.
[3:00:12.020 --> 3:00:15.660]  I want to thank you all just briefly.
[3:00:15.660 --> 3:00:20.380]  People really complained, and I get it, that on that Superstorable Foods deal we did, where
[3:00:20.380 --> 3:00:25.060]  you got like $100 off, that we only did the three months supply.
[3:00:25.060 --> 3:00:30.820]  So they've relaunched to preparewithalex.com, and you can get a whole bunch of deals.

[3:00:39.380 --> 3:00:40.380]  preparewithalex.com.
[3:00:40.380 --> 3:00:42.380]  I just have the sheet right here.
[3:00:42.380 --> 3:00:43.900]  I don't know where it is.
[3:00:43.900 --> 3:00:47.620]  Maybe you guys can reprint it for me, but there's a bunch of deals too on their solar
[3:00:47.620 --> 3:00:49.140]  charging station.
[3:00:49.140 --> 3:00:50.140]  These are all great products.
[3:00:50.140 --> 3:00:54.260]  They come out with innovative stuff, infowarstore.com.

[3:01:21.700 --> 3:01:23.500]  That's are the lowest price, the highest quality.
[3:01:23.500 --> 3:01:24.500]  They never go this low.
[3:01:24.500 --> 3:01:29.580]  They're doing it for us to support the infowar, preparewithalex.com, and there's also a toll
[3:01:29.580 --> 3:01:30.580]  free number there.
[3:01:30.580 --> 3:01:41.580]  You can call 8888-411-035-0888-411-035-0, but right now, Paul Joseph Watson from the
[3:01:41.580 --> 3:01:46.460]  UK takes over.
[3:01:46.460 --> 3:01:53.980]  Transmuting worldwide from the summit.newstudios in the United Kingdom, you're listening to
[3:01:53.980 --> 3:01:55.980]  Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:01:55.980 --> 3:02:03.980]  And we are asking the question tonight in advance of the first presidential debate.
[3:02:03.980 --> 3:02:10.220]  Is Joe Biden wearing an earpiece, and can he withstand a 90 minute debate?
[3:02:10.220 --> 3:02:15.500]  Kind of getting 2016 vibes all over again, because of course the same questions were
[3:02:15.500 --> 3:02:17.700]  asked about Hillary.
[3:02:17.700 --> 3:02:23.580]  Remember the infamous box with wires from it that she was apparently wearing down the
[3:02:23.580 --> 3:02:26.220]  back of her pantsuit that time?
[3:02:26.220 --> 3:02:30.300]  That attracted headlines in September 2016.
[3:02:30.300 --> 3:02:34.420]  Of course questions as to whether she was wearing an earpiece.
[3:02:34.420 --> 3:02:38.780]  Joe Biden's probably going to have to rely on it way more than she did, if indeed that
[3:02:38.780 --> 3:02:44.620]  turns out to be the case, given his performance in nine minute television interviews, never
[3:02:44.620 --> 3:02:48.900]  mind 90 minute live presidential debates.
[3:02:48.900 --> 3:02:51.100]  So we're going to get into that in the next segment.
[3:02:51.100 --> 3:02:57.220]  First, though, I want to talk about this because we continue to have rampant moral panic, rampant
[3:02:57.220 --> 3:03:01.940]  hysterical fear mongering, specifically in the United Kingdom out of any other European
[3:03:01.940 --> 3:03:06.700]  country about the coronavirus and the new lockdown.
[3:03:06.700 --> 3:03:12.060]  And yes, it looks like there's going to be a new nationwide lockdown across the United
[3:03:12.060 --> 3:03:18.780]  Kingdom here in the next week or two, which is actually what we predicted months ago when
[3:03:18.780 --> 3:03:23.300]  we were supposed to be getting back to the new normal.
[3:03:23.300 --> 3:03:24.300]  What is the new normal?
[3:03:24.300 --> 3:03:27.580]  Well, there's a headline today, Summit.News.
[3:03:27.580 --> 3:03:33.640]  New normal, MPU just mandatory Corona vaccination to be allowed to travel.
[3:03:33.640 --> 3:03:35.780]  We predicted this all along first.
[3:03:35.780 --> 3:03:40.940]  You accept the face mask, then you accept the government app, the track and trace app
[3:03:40.940 --> 3:03:46.540]  to be allowed to go to a restaurant, go to a pub to use a taxi.
[3:03:46.540 --> 3:03:53.180]  And then, of course, you have to accept the vaccine and now a conservative MP, conservative
[3:03:53.180 --> 3:03:58.820]  in name only, has called for mandatory Corona vaccination certificates distributed by the
[3:03:58.820 --> 3:03:59.820]  army.
[3:03:59.820 --> 3:04:03.660]  Oh, yes, it's going to be the army doling them out that will determine whether people
[3:04:03.660 --> 3:04:05.940]  will be allowed to travel internationally.
[3:04:05.940 --> 3:04:08.860]  This is what we predicted from the very beginning.
[3:04:08.860 --> 3:04:15.760]  This is the social credit score writ large for the West, based on the same communist
[3:04:15.760 --> 3:04:23.820]  Chinese model perfected by big tech corporations from America, like Google, like Facebook.
[3:04:23.820 --> 3:04:28.820]  During a debate in the British Parliament last night, MP Tobias Elwood urged the prime
[3:04:28.820 --> 3:04:34.820]  minister to have the British armed forces oversee the COVID-19 vaccination rollout
[3:04:34.820 --> 3:04:36.940]  process.
[3:04:36.940 --> 3:04:43.100]  He noted that with the vaccine being potentially six months away, quote, mass vaccine rollout
[3:04:43.100 --> 3:04:46.540]  is an enormous responsibility, and we need to get it right.
[3:04:46.540 --> 3:04:51.460]  So he's basically written a letter to Boris Johnson, the leader of the UK, urging him
[3:04:51.460 --> 3:04:57.900]  to give the Ministry of Defense, that's the military, the power to ship out vaccines across
[3:04:57.900 --> 3:05:04.140]  the country and set up regional distribution hubs, those will be the vaccine quarantine
[3:05:04.140 --> 3:05:11.060]  centers, as well as developing a national database to track progress and issue the vaccination
[3:05:11.060 --> 3:05:12.060]  certificates.
[3:05:12.060 --> 3:05:19.620]  Of course, they're going to combine the quarantine centers with the rollout of the vaccinations.
[3:05:19.620 --> 3:05:23.980]  And then he outlined exactly what the agenda really was, which we've been saying for the
[3:05:23.980 --> 3:05:29.860]  past six months plus, he said the vaccination certificates, quote, will probably have to
[3:05:29.860 --> 3:05:35.460]  be internationally recognized in order to allow travel international travel.
[3:05:35.460 --> 3:05:36.460]  That's right.
[3:05:36.460 --> 3:05:43.220]  Not only are you not getting in a taxi, if you don't get the vaccine and obviously afterwards
[3:05:43.220 --> 3:05:49.180]  the vaccine certificate, not only are you going to be denied the right to purchase food
[3:05:49.180 --> 3:05:54.380]  in a restaurant, maybe in the future in a grocery store, if this is all tied into your
[3:05:54.380 --> 3:05:59.740]  negatively impacted social credit score, you will be denied travel.
[3:05:59.740 --> 3:06:08.060]  Now, of course, under these coronavirus lockdowns, regional lockdowns, they forbid by law, it's
[3:06:08.060 --> 3:06:09.060]  very hard to enforce.
[3:06:09.060 --> 3:06:13.660]  But as we've seen in Melbourne, Australia, they literally have police checkpoints on
[3:06:13.660 --> 3:06:19.180]  the highways, checking people's work permits and employment contracts to make sure they
[3:06:19.180 --> 3:06:27.060]  have the permission to drive outside the immediate area to go to work at 9am in the morning.
[3:06:27.060 --> 3:06:31.940]  So he's talking about international travel, and if we let this get passed without any
[3:06:31.940 --> 3:06:34.860]  form of resistance, it'll be even worse than that.
[3:06:34.860 --> 3:06:41.340]  It will be regional travel than the regional lockdowns in the United Kingdom, whereby law
[3:06:41.340 --> 3:06:47.340]  you're not allowed to leave your immediate council tax area.
[3:06:47.340 --> 3:06:49.940]  That's the situation that they'll try to ram through.
[3:06:49.940 --> 3:06:56.420]  If they pursue this mandatory vaccination agenda, which is what MP Tobias Ellwood is
[3:06:56.420 --> 3:07:03.100]  pushing for in parliament right now, it, of course, is going to be a human rights minefield.
[3:07:03.100 --> 3:07:08.900]  We're going to come back to more about coronavirus, the latest restrictions, the latest draconian
[3:07:08.900 --> 3:07:09.900]  measures and more.
[3:07:09.900 --> 3:07:10.900]  Summit.News, don't go away.
[3:07:10.900 --> 3:07:11.900]  The planets have aligned globally.
[3:07:11.900 --> 3:07:12.900]  They've aligned nationally.
[3:07:12.900 --> 3:07:13.900]  They've aligned financially, culturally, but most importantly, spiritually.
[3:07:13.900 --> 3:07:24.900]  We are living at a point in human development that will decide the entire future destiny.
[3:07:24.900 --> 3:07:32.340]  So that's why big tech control of the very dark forces of the globalist is trying to
[3:07:32.340 --> 3:07:38.500]  dumb us down, isolate us, make us depressed, make us alone, and try to control every aspect
[3:07:38.500 --> 3:07:43.180]  of our lives, literally brainwashing us with the stimuli that they look forward, because
[3:07:43.180 --> 3:07:49.060]  they do not want us to take our birthright, not just of Americana, but of true Christendom
[3:07:49.060 --> 3:07:51.740]  and the Renaissance and the Enlightenment.
[3:07:51.740 --> 3:07:55.860]  They are trying to create the new dark age where they have all the high technology and
[3:07:55.860 --> 3:08:01.180]  life extension, and we are walled off in a technocracy that controls us through carbon
[3:08:01.180 --> 3:08:04.180]  credits and through a social credit score.
[3:08:04.180 --> 3:08:05.420]  This is their plan.
[3:08:05.420 --> 3:08:11.780]  We must come together and awaken out of our trance and say, no, we must embrace God.
[3:08:11.780 --> 3:08:17.220]  I don't want to be negative about the prospects of the election, but I need to be honest with
[3:08:17.220 --> 3:08:18.220]  everybody.
[3:08:18.220 --> 3:08:22.740]  The Democrats and their deep state controllers, communist, Chinese, have come out and said
[3:08:22.740 --> 3:08:26.180]  they're going to contest the election, they know that Trump's going to win a landslide.
[3:08:26.180 --> 3:08:30.740]  And the destabilization that that's going to cause is going to further destroy the markets
[3:08:30.740 --> 3:08:31.740]  and the economy.
[3:08:31.740 --> 3:08:35.860]  And going into the future, even if Trump is able to prove that he's won the election,
[3:08:35.860 --> 3:08:41.980]  the Democrats have said they're going to break away politically and culturally into
[3:08:41.980 --> 3:08:47.580]  the blue states and blue cities and basically use that as a pretext of sabotage.
[3:08:47.580 --> 3:08:53.900]  The Republicans are more so until this cancer is rooted out, until these criminals that
[3:08:53.900 --> 3:08:58.260]  work with foreign governments, they're trying to basically destroy the country are punished
[3:08:58.260 --> 3:08:59.260]  and removed.
[3:08:59.260 --> 3:09:00.260]  It's just going to continue to happen.
[3:09:00.260 --> 3:09:06.500]  And so that's the big problem here is that we have a stomach dug in corruption by people
[3:09:06.500 --> 3:09:13.740]  that hate the country's very existence.
[3:09:13.740 --> 3:09:23.620]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:09:23.620 --> 3:09:34.100]  You're listening to the summit.news radio hour with Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:09:34.100 --> 3:09:39.380]  So we have a situation in the UK under the new coronavirus lockdown rules which were
[3:09:39.380 --> 3:09:47.900]  beefed up last week where an Englishman who goes into a pub to order a pint of beer has
[3:09:47.900 --> 3:09:55.180]  to produce more documentation than an illegal boat migrant entering England.
[3:09:55.180 --> 3:09:58.020]  That's literally literally the truth right now.
[3:09:58.020 --> 3:10:04.020]  Of course, we've had record boat migrant arrivals over the entire summer, thousands and thousands
[3:10:04.020 --> 3:10:07.820]  a day at this point, they're allowed straight into the country.
[3:10:07.820 --> 3:10:14.820]  In many cases, given free hotel board, given free food at taxpayer expense, they're carrying
[3:10:14.820 --> 3:10:18.900]  in many cases no documentation whatsoever.
[3:10:18.900 --> 3:10:24.260]  But if you go into a pub, if you go into a restaurant, you have to at least sign over
[3:10:24.260 --> 3:10:28.500]  your name and address, your contact details, your phone number.
[3:10:28.500 --> 3:10:34.220]  And now in many cases, as I'm going to get onto, they're actually denying people service,
[3:10:34.220 --> 3:10:40.620]  denying people entry to bars and restaurants if they haven't downloaded and scanned in and
[3:10:40.620 --> 3:10:47.700]  checked in with the government track and trace COVID app, which 10 million people have done
[3:10:47.700 --> 3:10:51.420]  by the way out of the population of about 65 million.
[3:10:51.420 --> 3:10:55.140]  But of course, the vast majority haven't.
[3:10:55.140 --> 3:11:00.140]  It's been a complete disaster, the rollout of this app, as all government apps usually
[3:11:00.140 --> 3:11:01.980]  are.
[3:11:01.980 --> 3:11:07.540]  It works by means of Bluetooth, so if you happen to pass within two meters of somebody
[3:11:07.540 --> 3:11:15.500]  who's suspected to have been exposed to COVID, and again, bearing in mind, 91% of these COVID
[3:11:15.500 --> 3:11:18.580]  tests in the United Kingdom produce false positives.
[3:11:18.580 --> 3:11:25.220]  But if you happen to get within two meters of that person who they say has been exposed
[3:11:25.220 --> 3:11:31.020]  to coronavirus, then it's recorded in your app and you immediately receive a message
[3:11:31.020 --> 3:11:36.100]  from the government telling you that you have to self isolate, quarantine, put yourself
[3:11:36.100 --> 3:11:40.700]  under house arrest for a minimum of 10 days.
[3:11:40.700 --> 3:11:45.500]  And then if you don't do that, if they catch up with you either through their regulatory
[3:11:45.500 --> 3:11:51.780]  system, through their home visits, which are now taking place, or through their newly empowered
[3:11:51.780 --> 3:11:57.220]  army of snitches and spies, which they've been encouraging the population to take up,
[3:11:57.220 --> 3:12:05.380]  then you face a fine of up to 10,000 pounds, which is about, I don't know, $13,000.
[3:12:05.380 --> 3:12:10.740]  This is the situation we have right now where people are literally being prevented from
[3:12:10.740 --> 3:12:14.460]  buying because they don't have the app.
[3:12:14.460 --> 3:12:18.260]  Reminds me of something biblical.
[3:12:18.260 --> 3:12:21.700]  And it's not just that you can't get into the pubs, the restaurants, it's what happens
[3:12:21.700 --> 3:12:28.380]  when you're in there, which leads me to this headline, London pub demands no extended eye
[3:12:28.380 --> 3:12:33.020]  contact as part of Corona rules.
[3:12:33.020 --> 3:12:38.820]  Now it's still up for debate whether this was actually a troll by the manager, the owner
[3:12:38.820 --> 3:12:45.620]  of the pub, who is sick to the back teeth of pedantic petty coronavirus rules.
[3:12:45.620 --> 3:12:51.980]  Maybe he slipped this in there to kind of satirize the absurdity of the situation, but then again
[3:12:51.980 --> 3:12:56.780]  looking at what's happened elsewhere, as I'm going to get onto, maybe not.
[3:12:56.780 --> 3:13:01.180]  I mean, there's no indication that this was a troll, it's so ridiculous that some people
[3:13:01.180 --> 3:13:02.180]  think it is.
[3:13:02.180 --> 3:13:08.940]  But a pub in London has issued a set of coronavirus rules of social distancing that demands customers
[3:13:08.940 --> 3:13:13.820]  do not engage in, quote, extended eye contact with people sat on other tables.
[3:13:13.820 --> 3:13:19.580]  Because completely ridiculous, coronavirus is not spread by eye contact.
[3:13:19.580 --> 3:13:27.340]  This is yet another way to atomize, to ostracize people from others as they try to collectively
[3:13:27.340 --> 3:13:34.820]  crush people's rights and eradicate individuality, which is one of the key goals of these draconian
[3:13:34.820 --> 3:13:35.820]  rules.
[3:13:35.820 --> 3:13:41.860]  An information sheet for the London Fields pub tells customers they must wear a face mask
[3:13:41.860 --> 3:13:44.540]  when entering, exiting or moving around the room.
[3:13:44.540 --> 3:13:49.780]  Oh, and by the way, in some pubs, according to anecdote evidence, if you even stand up
[3:13:49.780 --> 3:13:55.940]  at the table without your mask on, you'll get shouted down by the petty enforcers working
[3:13:55.940 --> 3:13:57.460]  at the pub.
[3:13:57.460 --> 3:14:03.300]  However, the advisory also tells drinkers, quote, no handshaking, high fiving or extended
[3:14:03.300 --> 3:14:06.140]  eye contact with anyone not on your table.
[3:14:06.140 --> 3:14:10.020]  And there's a screenshot of that in the article.
[3:14:10.020 --> 3:14:13.620]  Some people saying it's a troll, but from what we've seen before, maybe not.
[3:14:13.620 --> 3:14:20.140]  And as I referenced in this article last month, we reported on a coronavirus alert sign seen
[3:14:20.140 --> 3:14:23.740]  in the northern market town of Stockton on Tees.
[3:14:23.740 --> 3:14:29.060]  We've got a picture of it right there, which told pedestrians to quote, look away when passing
[3:14:29.060 --> 3:14:30.060]  other people.
[3:14:30.060 --> 3:14:32.980]  You can't even look them in the eye.
[3:14:32.980 --> 3:14:39.240]  I guess trying to get into their warped logic, they think that if you're close enough to
[3:14:39.240 --> 3:14:43.940]  somebody that you're able to look them in the eye square, maybe that means you're too
[3:14:43.940 --> 3:14:44.940]  close.
[3:14:44.940 --> 3:14:49.780]  That's the only thing I can imagine that went through their demented heads when they put
[3:14:49.780 --> 3:14:52.700]  this on the sign.
[3:14:52.700 --> 3:14:57.460]  So they're literally telling people now that coronavirus can spread if you look at somebody.
[3:14:57.460 --> 3:15:01.220]  I mean, that is the level we're at.
[3:15:01.220 --> 3:15:07.180]  As we highlighted yesterday, pubs have also banned singing and dancing.
[3:15:07.180 --> 3:15:08.180]  Yes.
[3:15:08.180 --> 3:15:10.660]  Oliver Cromwell is back.
[3:15:10.660 --> 3:15:17.700]  Of course, the 17th century leader of the parliament, Oliver Cromwell, who became protector
[3:15:17.700 --> 3:15:24.100]  of the country back then, with his puritanical revolution, he also closed all the bars and
[3:15:24.100 --> 3:15:27.180]  theaters and he also squashed everybody's fun.
[3:15:27.180 --> 3:15:32.820]  Now they're saying you can't even sing or dance under these new COVID rules.
[3:15:32.820 --> 3:15:38.140]  Problem is, as we've seen over the past few days, since these laws were announced, when
[3:15:38.140 --> 3:15:44.020]  the curfew comes in at 10 PM, as it does every night, all the people in the pubs just spill
[3:15:44.020 --> 3:15:49.980]  out onto the streets and have street parties and then go home to each other's houses
[3:15:49.980 --> 3:15:50.980]  anyway.
[3:15:50.980 --> 3:15:58.660]  So again, it serves no purpose in stopping coronavirus spreading or maintaining social
[3:15:58.660 --> 3:15:59.660]  distancing.
[3:15:59.660 --> 3:16:03.420]  And as many experts are saying today, it actually makes it worse.
[3:16:03.420 --> 3:16:09.020]  Which is why we ask the question, do they really care about social distancing or is
[3:16:09.020 --> 3:16:15.300]  it about pure draconian ruthless control?
[3:16:15.300 --> 3:16:19.580]  And on this subject, there's also an article out of the Daily Mail here.
[3:16:19.580 --> 3:16:24.420]  Middle-aged customers claim they are being embarrassed by young and arrogant bar staff
[3:16:24.420 --> 3:16:30.380]  who turn them away for not having the NHS COVID-19 app, despite rules saying they don't
[3:16:30.380 --> 3:16:31.660]  need one.
[3:16:31.660 --> 3:16:38.380]  So the law states that you don't have to, under the current law, download this app to
[3:16:38.380 --> 3:16:40.060]  enter a pub or restaurant.
[3:16:40.060 --> 3:16:41.700]  That is not the law.
[3:16:41.700 --> 3:16:46.060]  But many pubs and restaurants have just chosen to make up the law themselves and are now
[3:16:46.060 --> 3:16:52.260]  literally turning away people, specifically older people, many of whom don't even have
[3:16:52.260 --> 3:16:58.220]  smartphones or don't have the latest smartphone because that was another colossal failure.
[3:16:58.220 --> 3:17:03.940]  Your iPhone software has to be updated to the latest version, many millions of people.
[3:17:03.940 --> 3:17:04.940]  Don't have that.
[3:17:04.940 --> 3:17:05.940]  Don't want to do that.
[3:17:05.940 --> 3:17:10.300]  And of course, any of that middle-aged and older people who don't even know how to use
[3:17:10.300 --> 3:17:16.940]  an app, don't even know how to use a smartphone, don't want to, never have, but screw them.
[3:17:16.940 --> 3:17:21.140]  Middle-aged customers are being humiliated by app disciples at pubs and restaurants
[3:17:21.140 --> 3:17:26.500]  banning them from going in without the NHS COVID app, despite government rules saying
[3:17:26.500 --> 3:17:28.700]  it's not compulsory.
[3:17:28.700 --> 3:17:32.660]  So then you have a bunch of tweets as we see and hear from people, middle-aged and elderly
[3:17:32.660 --> 3:17:37.980]  people over the past few nights saying, not only are they being denied entry, they're
[3:17:37.980 --> 3:17:45.580]  being hectic, lectured, publicly humiliated, publicly shamed by predominantly younger bar
[3:17:45.580 --> 3:17:51.820]  staff for not knowing or not wanting to download, not knowing how or not wanting to download
[3:17:51.820 --> 3:17:53.340]  this app.
[3:17:53.340 --> 3:17:58.780]  So on top of not being able to socialize, meet their friends, go to the bar, enjoy a
[3:17:58.780 --> 3:18:04.580]  meal in a restaurant, they're now getting screeched at by 19-year-old kids because they don't
[3:18:04.580 --> 3:18:07.300]  know how to download an app.
[3:18:07.300 --> 3:18:08.300]  Absolutely incredible.
[3:18:08.300 --> 3:18:10.300]  We'll be back.
[3:18:10.300 --> 3:18:15.700]  Remember the global lock-down for witnessing the Black Lives Matter, antiferriots and racial
[3:18:15.700 --> 3:18:23.300]  attacks we're all seeing are publicly directed by a handful of top billionaires led by people
[3:18:23.300 --> 3:18:28.220]  like Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, of course, Tim Cook and others.
[3:18:28.220 --> 3:18:33.460]  They set up there with their trillions of dollars they control in their companies and
[3:18:33.460 --> 3:18:39.140]  they're hundreds of billions of dollars individually leveraging that against us and trying to create
[3:18:39.140 --> 3:18:43.540]  an artificial revolution against local government and police.
[3:18:43.540 --> 3:18:47.540]  And the mayors are, again, they're playing their political game to try to trigger the
[3:18:47.540 --> 3:18:52.300]  complete breakdown of the United States and Western Europe so these billionaires can come
[3:18:52.300 --> 3:18:54.620]  in and buy it all up for billions on the dollar.
[3:18:54.620 --> 3:18:58.180]  That's why I'm so angry at these globalists because when you're looking at them, they're
[3:18:58.180 --> 3:19:02.980]  the ones that sit in their councils and have decided to run these plans against us.
[3:19:02.980 --> 3:19:06.180]  They are enemies of humanity and must be dealt with.
[3:19:06.180 --> 3:19:10.220]  It's us or them, period.
[3:19:10.220 --> 3:19:15.700]  Remember the enemy is working around the clock to suppress voices of independent people
[3:19:15.700 --> 3:19:18.460]  all over the world.
[3:19:18.460 --> 3:19:23.940]  The globalists have a plan for total vertical integration.
[3:19:23.940 --> 3:19:32.140]  Absolute authoritarianism to where you are a captive of their devices, of their control.
[3:19:32.140 --> 3:19:35.420]  But that is only a means to an end.
[3:19:35.420 --> 3:19:39.740]  Once they have the electronic straightjacket in place, they are on record that they will
[3:19:39.740 --> 3:19:44.900]  bring in forced inoculations that sterilize you and your family and worse.
[3:19:44.900 --> 3:19:50.180]  But the vaccine is being pushed by the United Nations, actually give people polio and actually
[3:19:50.180 --> 3:19:52.260]  give people cancer.
[3:19:52.260 --> 3:19:54.060]  Most cancer is viral.
[3:19:54.060 --> 3:19:57.980]  That's a big secret, but the secret is beginning to come out.
[3:19:57.980 --> 3:20:00.860]  It's even in the Associated Press.
[3:20:00.860 --> 3:20:06.660]  Remember all of these banned videos and reports are banned on video, but only you can share
[3:20:06.660 --> 3:20:33.060]  them and save humanity.
[3:20:33.060 --> 3:20:41.380]  That's the really bad news.
[3:20:41.380 --> 3:20:45.540]  The good news is this has triggered people out of their sleep all over the world and
[3:20:45.540 --> 3:20:48.980]  the resistance is mounting and the globalists are panicking.
[3:20:48.980 --> 3:20:53.140]  So bottom line, we're in the fight, we're starting to win, but it's serious.
[3:20:53.140 --> 3:20:57.780]  So pray to God for a global awakening, support InfoWars, spread the word and buy products
[3:20:57.780 --> 3:20:58.780]  at InfoWarsTour.com.
[3:20:58.780 --> 3:21:03.580]  Literally, we're having an emergency keep InfoWars sale happening right now.
[3:21:03.580 --> 3:21:12.860]  Please visit InfoWarsTour.com and keep us on air, thank you so much.
[3:21:12.860 --> 3:21:23.740]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:21:23.740 --> 3:21:39.060]  So we face a new lockdown here in the United Kingdom, probably a nationwide lockdown.
[3:21:39.060 --> 3:21:42.900]  They've already locked down numerous regions of the country, two thirds of the country
[3:21:42.900 --> 3:21:46.380]  of Wales is under complete lockdown.
[3:21:46.380 --> 3:21:51.020]  So it's smoke and mirrors basically, they've locked down probably half the country at this
[3:21:51.020 --> 3:21:52.020]  point.
[3:21:52.020 --> 3:21:56.100]  We're going to announce a full lockdown anyway, they're talking about closing all the pubs
[3:21:56.100 --> 3:21:58.100]  and restaurants for two more weeks.
[3:21:58.100 --> 3:22:04.540]  These hospitality industries are already completely on their knees, the economy's ruined, jobless
[3:22:04.540 --> 3:22:11.460]  figures continue to rise and it's all based on hot air and baseless hysteria.
[3:22:11.460 --> 3:22:19.020]  In fact, if you look at a graph, which is posted on the website, lockdownskeptics.org,
[3:22:19.020 --> 3:22:24.940]  which is an excellent source, especially if you're in the UK for tracking this COVID hysteria.
[3:22:24.940 --> 3:22:30.780]  They give a comparison as to the number of cases that the government coronavirus cases
[3:22:30.780 --> 3:22:36.540]  and remember, the vast majority of these cases are asymptomatic, the vast majority of false
[3:22:36.540 --> 3:22:38.260]  positives anyway.
[3:22:38.260 --> 3:22:42.500]  We know that by now that 91% of these current cases are false positives.
[3:22:42.500 --> 3:22:48.980]  They're testing 12 times the amount of people they tested at the height of the pandemic back
[3:22:48.980 --> 3:22:50.500]  in April.
[3:22:50.500 --> 3:22:56.860]  So obviously you're going to get more cases if you're testing 12 times more people.
[3:22:56.860 --> 3:23:00.900]  The key figures, the hospitalizations, the deaths are never mentioned in these hysterical
[3:23:00.900 --> 3:23:01.900]  media reports.
[3:23:01.900 --> 3:23:07.300]  But there you see the graph that we just saw, which is the predicted number of coronavirus
[3:23:07.300 --> 3:23:15.620]  cases per day that the government gave back about 10 days ago now as justification for
[3:23:15.620 --> 3:23:20.580]  all these new lockdown measures, the COVID martial enforcers peering through people's
[3:23:20.580 --> 3:23:27.180]  letterboxes and windows, the population being encouraged to snitch on people who gather
[3:23:27.180 --> 3:23:32.140]  in groups of more than six, the 10 p.m. pub curfews.
[3:23:32.140 --> 3:23:37.220]  All of this was based on this prediction from the government, which was taken from there
[3:23:37.220 --> 3:23:41.820]  esteemed advisors who have been proven spectacularly wrong in the past.
[3:23:41.820 --> 3:23:44.020]  And you see the graph.
[3:23:44.020 --> 3:23:52.580]  They were predicting by the end of September up to 15,000 coronavirus cases a day.
[3:23:52.580 --> 3:23:56.300]  The red bar you see there is the prediction the government made.
[3:23:56.300 --> 3:23:59.940]  The blue bar is the number of cases that we're actually seeing.
[3:23:59.940 --> 3:24:06.620]  And of course, now you see the number of cases going down and it's complete odds with the
[3:24:06.620 --> 3:24:13.940]  amount of cases the government suggested we're going to be recorded over the next two weeks.
[3:24:13.940 --> 3:24:17.940]  But again, it doesn't matter if their own experts have been completely wrong in the
[3:24:17.940 --> 3:24:24.940]  past, claiming that coronavirus would kill 500,000 people if we didn't impose a national
[3:24:24.940 --> 3:24:30.340]  lockdown, didn't in Sweden, now they have the lowest death rate out of the entirety
[3:24:30.340 --> 3:24:35.820]  of Europe, they have herd immunity, but they're still listening to the same idiots who got
[3:24:35.820 --> 3:24:40.780]  it spectacularly wrong in the first place, and who have ruined our economy, who have
[3:24:40.780 --> 3:24:46.940]  ruined the job prospects for millions of young people, who have literally killed tens of
[3:24:46.940 --> 3:24:52.860]  thousands of people in this country who will not get treatment and haven't gotten treatment
[3:24:52.860 --> 3:24:59.660]  for serious illnesses such as cancer and others, but they're still listening to the same idiots
[3:24:59.660 --> 3:25:05.300]  even though they've been proven wrong time and time again.
[3:25:05.300 --> 3:25:11.620]  And as to the lockdown itself, we got a clip here from an MP, Sir Desmond Swain, who got
[3:25:11.620 --> 3:25:16.140]  up in the House of Commons last night during the same debate, by the way, where the other
[3:25:16.140 --> 3:25:21.860]  conservative in name only MP advocated mandatory vaccines for travel.
[3:25:21.860 --> 3:25:26.660]  And he really encapsulated the absolute horror that's been imposed on us in terms of human
[3:25:26.660 --> 3:25:32.100]  rights and liberty suppression over the past six, seven months.
[3:25:32.100 --> 3:25:36.180]  Here is Sir Desmond Swain, let's roll the clip.
[3:25:36.180 --> 3:25:42.700]  Less than a year ago I celebrated what I thought was the election of a sceptical and liberal
[3:25:42.700 --> 3:25:48.420]  conservative administration, and now I'm left wondering if the Prime Minister hasn't been
[3:25:48.420 --> 3:25:57.620]  abducted by Dr Strangelove and reprogrammed by the sage over to the dark side.
[3:25:57.620 --> 3:26:05.380]  The purpose of politicians is to impose a measure of proportion, a sense of proportion
[3:26:05.380 --> 3:26:08.900]  on science and not to be enthralled to it.
[3:26:08.900 --> 3:26:14.620]  Now I will make myself very unpopular, but I believe that the appearance of the chiefs
[3:26:14.620 --> 3:26:18.700]  last week should have been a sacking offence.
[3:26:18.700 --> 3:26:26.420]  When they presented that graph, or with the caveat that it wasn't a prediction, but nevertheless
[3:26:26.420 --> 3:26:35.980]  it was clear that they presented it as a plausible scenario, with its 50,000 cases per day by
[3:26:35.980 --> 3:26:43.300]  mid-October based on the doubling of infections by the week.
[3:26:43.300 --> 3:26:52.900]  Not once, not on one day since March have there been infections on that day that were
[3:26:52.900 --> 3:26:57.780]  double that of the day of the week proceeding.
[3:26:57.780 --> 3:27:00.220]  Not once, where did this doubling come from?
[3:27:00.220 --> 3:27:04.180]  What was their purpose in presenting such a graph?
[3:27:04.180 --> 3:27:11.420]  It was the purpose of the fat boy in Pickwick papers, I want to make your flesh creep.
[3:27:11.420 --> 3:27:16.660]  It was project fear, it was an attempt to terrify the British people as if they hadn't
[3:27:16.660 --> 3:27:20.660]  been terrified enough.
[3:27:20.660 --> 3:27:24.620]  You see him talking about the British people being terrified, we've had articles in the
[3:27:24.620 --> 3:27:30.940]  past of people going out to tourist areas outside of London, outside of the major cities.
[3:27:30.940 --> 3:27:35.220]  Of course, for many people that's the only place they can go now, they can't go abroad
[3:27:35.220 --> 3:27:40.540]  because if they come back, they're subject to mandatory two week quarantines, people
[3:27:40.540 --> 3:27:45.340]  have got jobs, they're not even allowed to leave their homes to go to their jobs.
[3:27:45.340 --> 3:27:51.740]  So people are increasingly holidaying domestically and then in these holiday tourist towns you
[3:27:51.740 --> 3:27:56.900]  get other people who have similarly been terrified and we've had the articles, they will literally
[3:27:56.900 --> 3:28:01.500]  leap out of the way in the street if they see someone walking towards them without a
[3:28:01.500 --> 3:28:04.500]  face mask or walking too close to them.
[3:28:04.500 --> 3:28:10.060]  You see another graph there that we got up on screen again, this is all based on the
[3:28:10.060 --> 3:28:16.420]  supposition that these new cases, this explosion of new cases is because of all the young people
[3:28:16.420 --> 3:28:22.300]  going out to bars and restaurants and having fun and socializing, the actual case origins
[3:28:22.300 --> 3:28:28.540]  as you can see right there from bars and restaurants are 3%.
[3:28:28.540 --> 3:28:33.340]  Even if you believe that the tests are accurate and not the vast majority of false positives,
[3:28:33.340 --> 3:28:35.140]  3%.
[3:28:35.140 --> 3:28:42.620]  The majority 41% coming from schools and colleges and again for example in Scotland not a single
[3:28:42.620 --> 3:28:48.460]  person under the age of 25 has died of coronavirus without another serious illness or in fact
[3:28:48.460 --> 3:28:55.340]  I think it's total, not a single person under the age of 25 in Scotland has died of coronavirus
[3:28:55.340 --> 3:29:01.060]  throughout this whole pandemic and yet they're all completely under house arrest in their
[3:29:01.060 --> 3:29:05.700]  own halls of residence, we had the story a couple of days ago, students at Edinburgh
[3:29:05.700 --> 3:29:14.900]  University having to eat alone, having hall monitors, patrol the canteens, the diners
[3:29:14.900 --> 3:29:18.700]  and if they get up, if they try to get a drink from the front, they're immediately shouted
[3:29:18.700 --> 3:29:21.300]  down and told to sit back down.
[3:29:21.300 --> 3:29:28.820]  You have again COVID enforcer marshals knocking on their doors, checking for loud music and
[3:29:28.820 --> 3:29:32.700]  some of them have been told that they're not going to get home for Christmas at all, we
[3:29:32.700 --> 3:29:37.940]  had the story yesterday, students threatened with police action for displaying anti lockdown
[3:29:37.940 --> 3:29:42.300]  signs in windows, not only were they threatened with police action if they didn't take those
[3:29:42.300 --> 3:29:50.340]  signs down, which basically said help, we're imprisoned but they also literally posted
[3:29:50.340 --> 3:29:55.500]  police and security guards at the gates of these university halls of residence to physically
[3:29:55.500 --> 3:30:03.100]  prevent students from leaving, that's the situation across the country in terms of universities
[3:30:03.100 --> 3:30:09.820]  in the United Kingdom, meanwhile in Spain, Madrid explodes as police violently cracked
[3:30:09.820 --> 3:30:15.140]  down on anti lockdown protesters, of course we had a similar situation in the UK on Saturday
[3:30:15.140 --> 3:30:21.820]  when a completely peaceful protest took place in Trafalgar Square central London, no violence
[3:30:21.820 --> 3:30:26.220]  whatsoever, they actually had a moment of silence in London for the police officer who
[3:30:26.220 --> 3:30:32.820]  was killed in Croydon, so this was generally a pro police demonstration in London and then
[3:30:32.820 --> 3:30:38.540]  towards the end of it, the riot police just waded in and started bashing everyone, punching
[3:30:38.540 --> 3:30:42.860]  middle aged women in the stomach, throwing them to the floor, even though it's a peaceful
[3:30:42.860 --> 3:30:48.500]  protest, even though the vast majority of the protesters were not anti police, compared
[3:30:48.500 --> 3:30:55.020]  to Black Lives Matter, where they literally get down and kneel even after BLM agitators
[3:30:55.020 --> 3:31:00.820]  have violently attacked them, held to them with rocks and stones, you remember the famous
[3:31:00.820 --> 3:31:05.580]  video of the woman on the police horse almost killing herself, completely different reaction
[3:31:05.580 --> 3:31:09.380]  though for anti lockdown protesters, don't go away with it, the psychological warfare
[3:31:09.380 --> 3:31:15.380]  operation works is very very simple, they give you about freedoms by increments, always
[3:31:15.380 --> 3:31:19.140]  promising it's only going to be a short period of time, and then the restrictions will be
[3:31:19.140 --> 3:31:24.980]  released, but they're not, they have a significant amount of time, always four or five times
[3:31:24.980 --> 3:31:29.700]  longer than what they said, they will then slightly release it a little bit, only tighten
[3:31:29.700 --> 3:31:35.940]  it down even more later, this is called successive approximation, incrementalism, or the inch
[3:31:35.940 --> 3:31:40.820]  worm effect, this is the most common way that the Chalaterians take over, but there then
[3:31:40.820 --> 3:31:46.220]  becomes a point where the public wakes up, under the incrementalism, he starts resisting
[3:31:46.220 --> 3:31:50.460]  and then there's usually a giant purge and a clamp down, and you'll see more tyranny
[3:31:50.460 --> 3:31:55.300]  rolled out in just a few days, weeks or months than you saw in the previous ten years, and
[3:31:55.300 --> 3:32:01.420]  that's the period we're in globally right now, a world government, shy combat, globalist
[3:32:01.420 --> 3:32:06.340]  corporate takeover of the planet that wants you poor and absolutely sick under their thumb
[3:32:06.340 --> 3:32:15.140]  forever. Computer research scientists, engineers working with attorneys have conclusively proven
[3:32:15.140 --> 3:32:20.380]  and put out detailed reports at Tablet magazine, documenting what any trained eye could already
[3:32:20.380 --> 3:32:26.660]  see as plain as day. Communist Chinese working in tandem with the United Nations and the
[3:32:26.660 --> 3:32:31.420]  Democratic Party of the United States, as well as the media, put out fake videos and
[3:32:31.420 --> 3:32:37.020]  total hysteria to make it look like day of the dead into the world in China earlier this
[3:32:37.020 --> 3:32:41.820]  year. Then the UN put out standardized rules designed to keep the West locked down when
[3:32:41.820 --> 3:32:48.140]  China reopened within three months. This is the greatest strategic poo ever, this is
[3:32:48.140 --> 3:32:54.860]  21st century warfare being carried out through psychological means for the ultimate sigh-up.
[3:32:54.860 --> 3:32:59.540]  Paul Joseph Watson has written about it at infowars.com, myself, Alex Jones, David and
[3:32:59.540 --> 3:33:03.300]  I know in short are covering this heavily. This is the way to bring down the globalist
[3:33:03.300 --> 3:33:06.900]  is exposing how communist China and the UN were behind the hysteria.
[3:33:06.900 --> 3:33:17.940]  Hello, my name is Dr. Fauci, and I've been at the NIH and CDC for 45 years. I've overseen
[3:33:17.940 --> 3:33:25.140]  well, you know, the AIDS pandemic and so many other things. And I take my orders from Bill
[3:33:25.140 --> 3:33:31.620]  Gates, Dr. Bill Gates. I mean, he's not a doctor, but he controls everything you do.
[3:33:31.620 --> 3:33:38.100]  And he now says you're going to take the shots. And of course, in England, they are now saying
[3:33:38.100 --> 3:33:44.100]  what I told you, you will not be allowed to travel. Leave your home until you take all
[3:33:44.100 --> 3:33:51.940]  the shots. Dr. Gates, I mean Bill Gates, your owner, your master says you will have to take
[3:33:51.940 --> 3:34:01.060]  four to five COVID shots a year for adult to for baby, baby, much more manageable, just
[3:34:01.060 --> 3:34:09.780]  like Bill Gates give you polio and vaccine. I'm Dr. Fauci reminding you that we owe you.
[3:34:09.780 --> 3:34:13.820]  If you look at the top tech billionaires in the big banks that finance and control them
[3:34:13.820 --> 3:34:18.260]  to a man and to a woman, they believe there's too many people on the earth and they constantly
[3:34:18.260 --> 3:34:22.900]  whine about when they want to go to a mountaintop or a national park, they have to look at us,
[3:34:22.900 --> 3:34:27.220]  the common people, they have to look at the proletariat, they have to look at the scum.
[3:34:27.220 --> 3:34:31.860]  That's why they love the lockdown, putting muscles on us. That gives them a big thrill
[3:34:31.860 --> 3:34:37.460]  controlling where we can go, what we can do, bankrupting Main Street, bankrupting small towns.
[3:34:37.460 --> 3:34:42.980]  All of it is a vertical integration consolidation so they can then dictate the terms of our total
[3:34:42.980 --> 3:34:48.900]  surrender, which is taking sterilant vaccines day one. Ladies and gentlemen, all the games are
[3:34:48.900 --> 3:34:54.340]  over. Playtime's over. They used all the entertainment and garbage to put us into a trance. And
[3:34:54.340 --> 3:34:59.460]  now the spiders moving in for the kill. You know this, I know this, it's all out in the open.
[3:34:59.460 --> 3:35:03.380]  The question is, what are we going to do about it? Well, the first thing is identify the enemy,
[3:35:03.380 --> 3:35:07.540]  identify the enemy, identify the enemy, identify your enemy now.
[3:35:07.540 --> 3:35:14.580]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:35:24.420 --> 3:35:30.900]  Broadcasting internationally from the Summit.News headquarters in the United Kingdom,
[3:35:30.900 --> 3:35:40.740]  it's Paul Joseph Watson. So people are asking the question, if Joe Biden can barely stand a nine
[3:35:40.740 --> 3:35:48.340]  minute TV appearance without numerous verbal slithers, gaffes, embarrassments, how on earth
[3:35:48.340 --> 3:35:54.980]  is he going to withstand the tougher test of a 90 minute live presidential debate?
[3:35:54.980 --> 3:36:00.420]  I mean, Robbie Starbott just tweeted this. Leftists have accused our president of being
[3:36:00.420 --> 3:36:05.940]  on cocaine, snorting Adderall, doing speed and everything else. They needed some excuse
[3:36:05.940 --> 3:36:11.300]  for his energy. Now that he challenged Joe Biden to a drug test, suddenly those same people
[3:36:11.300 --> 3:36:17.300]  don't want drug tests for politicians. And of course, Trump tweeted, we had the headline.
[3:36:18.020 --> 3:36:23.300]  Trump reacts to Biden drug test refusal. GI wonder why they've refused the drug test.
[3:36:23.300 --> 3:36:28.980]  They've apparently also refused the request to inspect Biden for a potential earpiece.
[3:36:29.860 --> 3:36:34.660]  Which again, Hawkins back to 2016 vibes. In fact, I was looking at this headline out of the sun.
[3:36:36.020 --> 3:36:41.380]  Says, what the hell is that? Hillary Clinton was wearing a mysterious box with wires during TV
[3:36:41.380 --> 3:36:45.540]  debate with Trump conspiracy theorist claim in latest bizarre theory. Because of course,
[3:36:45.540 --> 3:36:50.900]  we had all those images, all those weird images where they zoomed in on Hillary's pants,
[3:36:50.900 --> 3:36:57.940]  who are back. And there were all these weird bulges and box like devices that seem to be
[3:36:57.940 --> 3:37:03.300]  hidden in the back of her jacket, which were never explained. We also had speculation over her
[3:37:03.300 --> 3:37:09.060]  wearing an earpiece. There were several close up images and videos which suggested that she may
[3:37:09.940 --> 3:37:14.340]  have been wearing some kind of pearl to match the skin color on her ear.
[3:37:14.340 --> 3:37:22.340]  Of course, that was never proven. But now, apparently, they asked to inspect Biden's ears
[3:37:22.340 --> 3:37:28.740]  and he refused to do it just like he refused to do the drug test. Now, this headline report,
[3:37:28.740 --> 3:37:34.100]  Biden campaign requested debate break every 30 minutes. Of course, that came out of Fox News.
[3:37:34.980 --> 3:37:39.540]  Because we know that Biden can't again withstand a nine minute TV interview.
[3:37:39.540 --> 3:37:44.980]  How's it gonna withstand a 90 minute debate? Apparently, they requested a break every 30
[3:37:44.980 --> 3:37:50.740]  minutes, which from my knowledge and from what I've read on social media today is would be
[3:37:50.740 --> 3:37:57.380]  completely unprecedented for a presidential debate. So as the Trump campaign also reportedly
[3:37:57.380 --> 3:38:02.260]  asked for earpieces to be inspected to ensure Biden wasn't being fed lines by his staffers.
[3:38:02.260 --> 3:38:07.460]  And we have this headline also out of Breitbart. Joe Biden reverses course, declines to have
[3:38:07.460 --> 3:38:13.940]  ears inspected pre-debate despite agreeing days ago. Joe Biden's team has reportedly rejected
[3:38:13.940 --> 3:38:18.980]  the Trump campaign's request to have the former vice president's ears inspected for an electronic
[3:38:18.980 --> 3:38:25.060]  device prior to Tuesday night's debate, despite agreeing to the proposal just days ago.
[3:38:26.180 --> 3:38:32.020]  Trump's campaign requested that a third party inspects the ears of both candidates for listening
[3:38:32.020 --> 3:38:38.420]  devices ahead of the first presidential debate in Cleveland. Now, of course, Biden gave that
[3:38:38.420 --> 3:38:42.820]  interview last week with telemundo, where there are numerous, numerous claims flying around that
[3:38:42.820 --> 3:38:50.820]  he had to consult a teleprompter to answer an interview as questions. Now, the New York Post
[3:38:50.820 --> 3:38:55.540]  says Joe Biden's campaign agreed to an inspection for electronic earpieces at tonight's debate,
[3:38:55.540 --> 3:39:03.460]  but are now declining. So they're walking back on that. They did request the 30 minute break,
[3:39:03.460 --> 3:39:08.500]  every 30 minutes of break during the debate. Now they're claiming they never requested that,
[3:39:08.500 --> 3:39:14.580]  and I'm sure you can trust them. We also have this headline, Joe Biden has been given tonight's
[3:39:14.580 --> 3:39:23.300]  debate questions in advance. This was a claim made by radio host Todd Starnes, who cited KXEL1540's
[3:39:23.300 --> 3:39:29.460]  interview with political operative Jerome Corsi. Starnes tweeted word on the street is that Biden
[3:39:29.460 --> 3:39:34.500]  got tonight's debate questions in advance. Of course, the left's immediate reaction to that
[3:39:34.500 --> 3:39:40.420]  on social media was that it was fake news, because that had never happened, would it? I mean,
[3:39:40.420 --> 3:39:47.540]  democratic candidates would never be fed questions in advance, right? Wrong. In 2017,
[3:39:47.540 --> 3:39:54.020]  Democratic operative Donna Brazil admitted that she had exploited her role as a CNN commentator
[3:39:54.020 --> 3:40:00.580]  to feed debate questions to Hillary Clinton beforehand. Quoting from Brazil herself,
[3:40:01.540 --> 3:40:06.260]  in October, a subsequent release of emails revealed that among the many things I did
[3:40:06.260 --> 3:40:10.260]  in my role as Democratic operative and Democratic National Committee vice chair,
[3:40:10.260 --> 3:40:17.060]  prior to assuming the interim DNC chair position, was to share potential town hall topics with the
[3:40:17.060 --> 3:40:24.420]  Clinton campaign. Took her about a year to admit it, but admit it, she did. But again, the left
[3:40:24.420 --> 3:40:28.820]  is pretending that this claim by Jerome Corsi is completely out of the question and that would
[3:40:28.820 --> 3:40:32.980]  never happen, even though it literally happened during the last presidential election.
[3:40:34.500 --> 3:40:41.060]  And we also have this angle. Trump could ask Joe Biden about the n-word during tonight's debate.
[3:40:41.620 --> 3:40:46.500]  So basically, the Trump campaign released a list of 17 questions or talking points
[3:40:46.500 --> 3:40:52.260]  to Trump during tonight's debate, one of which includes a question about Biden's use of the
[3:40:52.260 --> 3:40:58.660]  n-word. It says, quote, you said the n-word 13 times during a 1985 Senate nomination fight
[3:40:58.660 --> 3:41:02.900]  when you were quoting something attributed to someone else. Do you think that was appropriate
[3:41:02.900 --> 3:41:09.060]  to do? Is that the only time you've said the n-word? Now, of course, it's unlikely that Trump will
[3:41:09.060 --> 3:41:13.860]  raise the issue. But given that this is one of the talking points he's been handed by his campaign,
[3:41:13.860 --> 3:41:19.860]  he may reference it if Biden deploys the usual trope of demonizing Trump as a racist.
[3:41:20.660 --> 3:41:27.380]  Many people are also asking if Trump will raise the point of Biden's behavior around women and
[3:41:27.380 --> 3:41:34.580]  young children, which if he did, that would probably top 2016's lock her up moment, but we'll
[3:41:34.580 --> 3:41:39.780]  wait to see if that happens. Because Biden's relationship with the African American community
[3:41:39.780 --> 3:41:45.460]  has been soured by several verbal slip-ups, including one where he asserted black voters
[3:41:45.460 --> 3:41:51.940]  ain't black if they vote Trump. And of course, we've had the multi-year leftist conspiracy
[3:41:51.940 --> 3:41:57.380]  theory that Trump referred to black people as n-words during the first season of the apprentice.
[3:41:57.380 --> 3:42:01.700]  They said the tape's coming, it's coming, it's coming, it's coming. It never emerged.
[3:42:02.660 --> 3:42:09.060]  We did have the story of Tracy Martin during the 2016 presidential campaign,
[3:42:09.060 --> 3:42:14.740]  a former travel chef with the Clinton administration who claimed that Hillary Clinton
[3:42:15.300 --> 3:42:20.900]  angrily called a black staff of the n-word during a charity event in the 90s.
[3:42:21.620 --> 3:42:25.860]  So this accusation of using the n-word has flown back and forth time and time again.
[3:42:25.860 --> 3:42:27.940]  The question is, will it come up again tonight?
[3:42:30.020 --> 3:42:35.140]  Now, Bill Kristol, the neocon-never Trumpa who has endorsed Joe Biden and says he's a Democrat
[3:42:35.140 --> 3:42:42.420]  until Trump is kicked out of office, he's afraid to watch the debate. Neocon-never-Trumpa Bill
[3:42:42.420 --> 3:42:47.140]  Kristol too afraid to watch Biden-Trump debate. He tweeted, quote,
[3:42:48.420 --> 3:42:52.340]  if it's too nerve-wracking to watch tonight's presidential debate, what do you recommend
[3:42:52.340 --> 3:42:59.540]  watching instead? Asking for a friend, clearly suggesting that he's anxious about Biden's
[3:42:59.540 --> 3:43:04.580]  performance. And we all know the reason behind that. We've all seen him on television claiming
[3:43:04.580 --> 3:43:08.900]  that hundreds of millions of people died from coronavirus. We've all seen his brain short
[3:43:08.900 --> 3:43:15.460]  circuiting on numerous different occasions. We've seen the polls, which show, I believe,
[3:43:15.460 --> 3:43:21.860]  the last poll showed about 38% of Americans actually think Biden has some form of dementia,
[3:43:21.860 --> 3:43:29.620]  including one in five Democrats. So it's unsurprising that Biden supporters are very nervous
[3:43:29.620 --> 3:43:36.340]  about him maintaining some kind of cognitive sanity for a 90-minute debate.
[3:43:36.900 --> 3:43:41.860]  And then if you looked at the responses to Kristol's tweet, they sounded a similar alarm bell.
[3:43:42.980 --> 3:43:46.660]  One of them said, I agree, Bill, I'm not watching either, especially when they said they're not
[3:43:46.660 --> 3:43:51.460]  fact-checking. And that's the point of the debate. Yeah, the point of the debate is to have some
[3:43:51.460 --> 3:43:59.220]  hyperpartisan CNN hack, biasly fact-checking every single thing President Trump says. That's not
[3:43:59.220 --> 3:44:04.580]  a debate. That is not a debate. A debate is between two people. It's not between Biden,
[3:44:04.580 --> 3:44:13.620]  Trump, and CNN, and Brian Stelter. So they're worried about Biden not performing. Somebody who's
[3:44:13.620 --> 3:44:20.020]  not worried about Trump's performance is Nigel Farage. Headline, Farage, Joe Biden won't compete
[3:44:20.020 --> 3:44:25.540]  with sharp-witted Trump in the debate. Arch-Brexit here in a long time. How many of President Donald
[3:44:25.540 --> 3:44:30.100]  Trump, Nigel Farage says he does not believe the 77-year-old Democrat presidential nominee, Joe
[3:44:30.100 --> 3:44:35.620]  Biden, will be a match for the sharp-witted and utterly determined president. We'll wait and see.
[3:44:36.500 --> 3:44:41.300]  Are they going to pump Biden up with some kind of stimulant to get him through the night? Is that
[3:44:41.300 --> 3:44:46.740]  why they wanted to break every 30 minutes? It remains to be seen. I mean, they got Hillary
[3:44:46.740 --> 3:44:51.540]  through them without having coughing fits every two minutes like she did on the campaign trail.
[3:44:51.540 --> 3:44:57.940]  So maybe they've got something up their sleeve, quite literally, maybe. Meanwhile,
[3:44:58.740 --> 3:45:03.540]  Instagram promotes obesity by refusing ads for weight loss programs because they may hurt
[3:45:03.540 --> 3:45:07.860]  people's feelings. Yes, this actually happened. This was a fitness guru called Alex.
[3:45:07.860 --> 3:45:20.100]  Oops. Facebook-owned Instagram rejected the ad,
[3:45:21.460 --> 3:45:26.660]  saying that it rejects material that uses images that excessively focus on a person's body or
[3:45:26.660 --> 3:45:32.900]  any given body part and that this can make users feel bad about themselves. Of course,
[3:45:32.900 --> 3:45:37.060]  the body positivity movement, this idea that being obese is natural and that young women
[3:45:37.060 --> 3:45:42.020]  should embrace it is horrendously harmful because obesity is linked to numerous
[3:45:42.020 --> 3:45:56.420]  life-threatening diseases. It's as ludicrous as promoting smoker positivity.
