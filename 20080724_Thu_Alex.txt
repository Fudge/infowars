[00:00.000 --> 00:14.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.040 --> 00:43.360]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones okay we gave you Willie Nelson
[00:43.360 --> 00:48.640]  yesterday and the congressman Dennis Kosinich the most sought-after congressman right now
[00:48.640 --> 00:53.840]  in the media that is the alternative media the national media is in news blackout about
[00:53.840 --> 00:59.680]  the impeachment hearing Friday big developments there congressman Ron Paul is scheduled to
[00:59.680 --> 01:08.560]  be joining us in T-minus 32 minutes from now or 33 after also on the hill two days ago
[01:08.560 --> 01:14.480]  the aircraft he was on with six other congressman depressurized flying out of Houston to DC
[01:14.480 --> 01:20.600]  for an airline safety debate and discussion with all the airline problems they've been
[01:20.600 --> 01:29.160]  having congressman Ron Paul joining us today to talk about the war the economy are they
[01:29.160 --> 01:33.800]  going into Iran he gave that speech last week to congress saying we're on the edge of something
[01:33.800 --> 01:39.160]  really big and something we can't turn back from bigger than what we've ever seen previously
[01:39.160 --> 01:51.000]  before so Ron Paul is coming up why didn't I ask Jesse Ventura to come to New York City
[01:51.000 --> 01:55.240]  for 9-11 this year why didn't I ask Willie Nelson to do that why didn't I ask Charlie
[01:55.240 --> 02:00.280]  Sheen to do that or Woody Harrelson or any of the other people I know that are prominent
[02:00.280 --> 02:08.680]  it's because as long as I'm doing my own show I don't have any anxiety as long as it's
[02:08.680 --> 02:13.480]  me and my little operation my websites and what I'm doing I'm not self-conscious I'm
[02:13.480 --> 02:18.920]  not worried about anything but when I start trying to organize big events it causes me
[02:18.920 --> 02:27.200]  months of hair pulling fingernail chewing anxiety and now I'm having that anxiety right
[02:27.200 --> 02:33.160]  now of course I a lot of energy really is what it is because a caller calls in and says
[02:33.160 --> 02:39.080]  Willie would you do a 9-11 truth benefit or anti-war benefit and Willie says yeah I'd
[02:39.080 --> 02:41.720]  love to do that and then I'm there in the break he says yeah why don't you handle that
[02:41.720 --> 02:46.560]  Alex and then he tells me to call him at 10 o'clock this morning and I did call him
[02:46.560 --> 02:52.320]  and then I decided to go ahead and call Ventura got him on the phone these guys are incredible
[02:52.320 --> 02:56.800]  one phone call again on the phone try getting me on the phone thousands of emails hundreds
[02:56.800 --> 03:02.160]  of calls I can't even keep track of anymore how they do it but big developments on that
[03:02.160 --> 03:11.960]  front will there be an anti-war slash 9-11 truth truth stock whatever you want to call
[03:11.960 --> 03:21.840]  it anti-war stock I don't know folks I will tell you it looks promising but I will let
[03:21.840 --> 03:30.360]  you in on that later in the hour I'll tell you what I'll do it at 24 after when we come
[03:30.360 --> 03:35.440]  in to the third segment I will break down what's happening and this is a message to
[03:35.440 --> 03:44.120]  Kurt Nemo and to Steve Watson Paul is on vacation well deserved with his girlfriend right now
[03:44.120 --> 03:49.360]  they're on the continent now they've left Jolly Old England I guess for a week so I
[03:49.360 --> 03:56.000]  need to Steve and I need Kurt to get an article out on this as soon as I go over it and I
[03:56.000 --> 04:02.320]  need you to then put updates in the two articles you wrote on both sides so that people know
[04:02.320 --> 04:08.640]  what's going on because obviously I mean Willie Nelson's had farm age with hundreds
[04:08.640 --> 04:22.000]  of thousands of people at it and people from you to the Beatles oh who's the Neil Young
[04:22.000 --> 04:27.280]  so I've got a lot of stuff to deal with here it's just amazing and we're trying to set
[04:27.280 --> 04:32.800]  this up in the next few months you know venues big venues are usually booked a year two years
[04:32.800 --> 04:40.200]  out people say I put on the best 9-11 conference ever and that was tortured behind the scenes
[04:40.200 --> 04:45.440]  1200 people shut up to that in LA you know this is something that conservatively we
[04:45.440 --> 04:54.200]  could probably get 50,000 people to long way to go short time to get there we'll be right

[07:58.760 --> 08:08.280]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues
[08:08.280 --> 08:16.760]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network you notice as soon as the american people start
[08:16.760 --> 08:23.320]  revolting against the increase in gas prices when it went up to $150 a barrel in the last month
[08:23.320 --> 08:31.640]  then suddenly oil drops by $25 a barrel overnight $27 a barrel if you want to get
[08:31.640 --> 08:38.760]  precise from its high of just a month or so ago then all the sudden they start dropping the price
[08:38.760 --> 08:43.880]  but i predicted this every summer they bring you to a new height remember when two dollars was just
[08:43.880 --> 08:50.120]  incredibly high and then 250 was unconscionable two years ago and then three dollars was just
[08:50.120 --> 08:57.800]  untold it's each summer and i predicted gas would go to over four dollars a gallon i said
[08:57.800 --> 09:05.560]  145 a barrel three months ago and that then it would drop down throughout the fall and winter
[09:05.560 --> 09:14.680]  around 120 and then next summer it's going to go to 200 plus dollars a barrel now that prediction
[09:14.680 --> 09:18.840]  is on record right there that's what they're going to do and we predicted everything else
[09:18.840 --> 09:27.000]  because we know their formula we know how they operate we know what they do so we will uh go
[09:27.000 --> 09:32.840]  over that a little bit here in the next few minutes let's just finish up with that now
[09:32.840 --> 09:37.560]  you see they apply the pressure they bring you to a new high and they lower a little bit to
[09:37.560 --> 09:46.680]  create the perception of man gas is only 390 a gallon now it was 425 on average and it was
[09:46.680 --> 09:55.320]  five bucks in la but now it's only 435 whoo man i man 425 the great days of 425 in la
[09:56.200 --> 09:59.800]  or in some areas or some mountainous areas of the country that was 550
[10:01.000 --> 10:10.200]  560 a gallon man it's only 490 now boy 490 man the days are cheap gas are back basic
[10:10.200 --> 10:15.720]  pavlovian psychology and then you take the heat off congress and then they take you another
[10:15.720 --> 10:19.960]  100 miles you push them back another 50 and think you've had a victory see they take five
[10:19.960 --> 10:24.920]  steps you push them back two steps and they take 10 steps you push them back four steps
[10:24.920 --> 10:28.760]  and they take 20 steps you push them back eight steps and they take a hundred steps
[10:28.760 --> 10:33.000]  and you push them back 40 steps and they take 200 steps and they you push them back 90 steps
[10:34.280 --> 10:39.640]  you see when they say compromise it means you always give up real estate you always give up
[10:39.640 --> 10:45.960]  liberties and freedoms, they always gain on raping you. The statistics always get worse on the family
[10:45.960 --> 10:54.120]  and savings and literacy and property ownership. The elite gets more and more powerful. We get
[10:54.120 --> 10:59.080]  more and more dumbed down as they put more chemicals in the vaccines and the food and the water.
[11:00.680 --> 11:05.160]  Of course, their excuses are, well, we don't want everybody to fight. It's kind of an in-your-thing
[11:05.160 --> 11:11.800]  face, in-your-face deal when you see the movie Serenity, where the global international galactic
[11:11.800 --> 11:17.560]  government is putting into the atmosphere a Prozac-type compound to make everybody not fight,
[11:17.560 --> 11:22.760]  but instead it kills 95% of the population, the other 5% turned into psychopathic killers.
[11:23.400 --> 11:27.880]  Then it cuts to the scientists that did it going, we didn't want anyone to fight. What is it all
[11:27.880 --> 11:34.520]  friendly? What is it all nice? Well, that's kind of the surface level for the thousands of technicians
[11:34.520 --> 11:39.240]  at the higher levels that know sodium fluoride attacks the brain and is very toxic. It's, well,
[11:39.240 --> 11:44.280]  it's just so they don't fight so we can war. Humans are naturally war-like and we need to
[11:44.280 --> 11:49.640]  engineer society to be peaceful. But higher above that, it's no, we're cold-bloodily dumbing everybody
[11:49.640 --> 11:53.640]  down so they're even more easily managed, so we can set up a global extermination grid to carry
[11:53.640 --> 12:00.520]  out eugenics. And then see all other political issues fall by the wayside when you find out,
[12:00.520 --> 12:04.760]  and it's in government documents and we've covered it and made films about it, that they are putting
[12:04.760 --> 12:11.160]  sodium fluoride in your water and over 70% of the US, over 60% of England, only about 40% of
[12:11.160 --> 12:20.280]  Europe has it in the water supplies to dumb you down. There's a reason, folks, that that matter
[12:20.280 --> 12:23.800]  of you jog five miles a day and try to eat healthy. If you're drinking sodium fluoride,
[12:23.800 --> 12:29.560]  you got memory loss, you got bad skin, and it is attacking all your glands, your bones,
[12:29.560 --> 12:35.880]  everything else, and it's just a scientific absolute fact. But because you are on the toxic
[12:35.880 --> 12:41.000]  sedative, you just can't get yourself moving to even properly filter that out. All right,
[12:41.000 --> 12:44.840]  I'm already digressing. You know, I got a bunch of news here. Ron Paul is scheduled to be coming
[12:44.840 --> 12:49.640]  up later in the show. Willie Nelson announces 9-11 anti-war event on the Alex Jones show,
[12:49.640 --> 12:53.480]  big developments on that front. I'll tell you in about about 10 minutes.
[12:53.480 --> 13:00.280]  Willie Nelson announced the 9-11 anti-war event, so we'll give you the facts on that,
[13:00.280 --> 13:04.760]  the new developments I talked to this morning, and Governor Ventura, US government, we know
[13:04.760 --> 13:08.600]  parenting better than you, proposal will give Washington unprecedented control over kids,
[13:08.600 --> 13:12.920]  everyone will get CPS visits. I told you, this is the new system.
[13:14.920 --> 13:20.760]  Heaven help us. You think government's bad now, they're just lining up. That was all just a prelude,
[13:20.760 --> 13:30.920]  a dress rehearsal. Democrats admit that they don't want you to have lower gas prices. They
[13:30.920 --> 13:35.160]  say it's social engineering to teach you to live with less, so they're being honest about their
[13:35.160 --> 13:42.120]  criminality. Feds are stockpiling food supplies. I've got a story on that. A bank gave counterfeit
[13:42.120 --> 13:48.120]  bills to people. They're making a big deal out of this in a Florida news station. It's all counterfeit,
[13:48.120 --> 13:55.400]  it's all federal reserve. 43 bus illegal aliens and immigration raid in Hawaii.
[13:56.680 --> 14:01.640]  World Health Organization returns to Iraq among improved security. That means they can start
[14:01.640 --> 14:07.720]  the vaccination and fluoridation there. The Iraqis won't be resisting anymore once they drink their
[14:07.720 --> 14:13.640]  fluoride. I told you this was coming. They're going to make you show ID everywhere to buy gas.
[14:13.640 --> 14:18.120]  It doesn't matter if you have a debit card. It doesn't matter if you have to be registered to be
[14:18.120 --> 14:23.560]  able to buy gas. That will be every other product. He starts with cold medicine and then everything
[14:23.560 --> 14:29.480]  else and then paint and now everybody, this is the new, getting you ready for the new national ID
[14:29.480 --> 14:34.760]  card. I remember 10 years ago reading a big corporate consortium white papers, think tank
[14:34.760 --> 14:38.920]  papers about how they would convince you for the casual society, how they would phase it in.
[14:38.920 --> 14:45.080]  See, once you've been trained when you're 60 years old to show ID for cigars, it's about training
[14:45.080 --> 14:54.040]  mindlessness into shopkeepers, mindlessness into, it's about engineering mindlessness into the TSA,
[14:54.040 --> 14:59.000]  the police, just they don't have any discretion. They don't have any thought. They just follow
[14:59.000 --> 15:04.200]  mindless regulations and look, we card 75 year old. I mean, I've seen people on
[15:04.200 --> 15:13.800]  walkers being carded buying pipe tobacco. Okay, over and over again. And I say to the shopkeeper,
[15:13.800 --> 15:17.080]  why are you doing that? I go, look, you see those cameras? I have to. And they swipe their card and
[15:17.080 --> 15:21.960]  it goes into a state police slash international database. Well, it's going to be for buying gas,
[15:21.960 --> 15:36.520]  buying food. It's happening now. And this is out of mainstream news. This is out of ABC News,
[15:37.480 --> 15:43.240]  ABC News National. Okay, we'll play that clip later.
[15:43.240 --> 15:51.960]  Speaking of the Willie Nelson situation, I am trying to finish a film right now
[15:53.160 --> 16:01.240]  labeled enemies of Jason Murnus. I am trying to go to the DNC and Denver. I have on what,
[16:01.240 --> 16:10.920]  14 employees total. And I'm trying to move right now trying to move in the next few weeks.
[16:10.920 --> 16:17.640]  I'm not whining. I just want people to know what I'm facing here. And now I'll drop to my lap. I
[16:17.640 --> 16:23.400]  will tell you after the break where it looks like this is going with the truth that big developments
[16:23.400 --> 16:33.000]  there. But I don't know, I just think this song happens to say it all. This song happens to break
[16:33.000 --> 16:39.720]  down exactly what my life is like every single day. And I just want everybody to share in the idea
[16:39.720 --> 16:44.120]  of all of you dedicating yourselves this much to the fight. Doesn't mean you'll be fighting
[16:44.120 --> 16:50.600]  a new world order at the level I am, but together we fight at a level far above what I'm able to
[16:50.600 --> 16:55.480]  do. Everything I'm able to do is because of you and the support and the past support you have
[16:55.480 --> 17:02.040]  given us as we exponentially grow and lead into what is no doubt the danger zone. So I salute
[17:02.040 --> 17:04.920]  all of you that have the courage to fight the new world order at Point Mike Range.
[17:04.920 --> 17:14.920]  And this song is for you.
[17:34.920 --> 17:54.920]  Are we going to do what they say can't be done.
[18:04.920 --> 18:14.920]  Are we going to do what they say can't be done.
[18:34.920 --> 18:56.920]  Are we going to do what they say can't be done.
[19:04.920 --> 19:28.920]  Are we going to do what they say can't be done.
[19:38.920 --> 19:43.080]  All right folks, we are going to skip this break. This is a network break. We are skipping it.
[19:43.880 --> 19:51.320]  Congressman Paul's man, Jesse Benton just called us. The Congressman needs to come on early
[19:51.320 --> 19:56.280]  because of scheduling conflicts. We're calling the Congressman right now instead of the bottom of
[19:56.280 --> 20:01.000]  the hour. I'll give you the William Elson slash Jesse Ventura news after the Congressman leaves
[20:01.000 --> 20:08.120]  us for this 20-minute interview. Have we gotten the Congressman yet? They're still juggling things
[20:08.120 --> 20:13.400]  well with all of his itinerary and what he's doing on the floor and the airplane emergency
[20:13.400 --> 20:20.120]  yesterday or two days ago. I am really surprised he can even join us today. So we're going ahead
[20:20.120 --> 20:25.880]  and skipping this break right now. We can give you every minute with Congressman Ron Paul that we
[20:25.880 --> 20:31.640]  can. We will take station break at the bottom of the hour for news for everybody out there
[20:31.640 --> 20:39.320]  on the AM and FM dial. Again, the websites are info wars.com and prisonplanet.com as well as
[20:39.320 --> 20:47.160]  prisonplanet.tv. And don't forget my new film Truth Rising has been out for just a few weeks.
[20:47.160 --> 20:51.400]  It's already had a big effect out on the web. A lot of you've gotten your DVDs and are making copies
[20:51.400 --> 20:57.400]  of them. It's all about the 9-11 Truth Movement, all the persecution that we go through, all the
[20:57.400 --> 21:01.720]  things that are happening as we try to just ask politicians serious questions. It's about the
[21:01.720 --> 21:07.080]  first responders and the deadly dust and it's also the evidence of inside job on 9-11. Very,
[21:07.080 --> 21:13.000]  very important film Truth Rising ladies and gentlemen available on DVD at infowars.com.
[21:13.000 --> 21:17.400]  Everybody needs this in their collection but more importantly everyone needs to get this out to
[21:17.400 --> 21:25.400]  everybody. It is of the utmost importance that we personalize and humanize and show the social
[21:25.400 --> 21:32.120]  evidence of just how big this movement to expose false flag government sponsored terrorism is and
[21:32.120 --> 21:40.040]  that's why Truth Rising is so vitally important. Again, available at infowars.com or by calling
[21:40.040 --> 21:54.760]  toll-free 888-253-3139 or 888-253-3139. I intend to ask Ron Paul, the congressman, doctor,
[21:56.360 --> 22:04.280]  presidential candidate about his speech last week. In fact, I need to pull that up so I have the
[22:04.280 --> 22:17.240]  text of it. It was an infowars.net story where he talked about something big happening, something
[22:17.800 --> 22:28.360]  big coming up and something that we needed to all be focused on and be aware of.
[22:28.360 --> 22:37.240]  Here I am on infowars.net trying to find it and I have found it in the exclusive news section
[22:37.240 --> 22:42.280]  on the right hand side. Ron Paul, some big events are about to occur. That's why this interview
[22:42.280 --> 22:48.520]  coming up is so important. Ron Paul, some big events are about to occur. Congressman Warrens of
[22:48.520 --> 22:55.080]  Chaos about to be unleashed on economic and political system by globalist intervention
[22:55.080 --> 23:01.720]  and world empire. Glad he made it through that depressurization to continue to fight against
[23:01.720 --> 23:08.200]  this. Texas congressman Ron Paul has warned that the House that he is convinced the time is now
[23:08.200 --> 23:14.040]  upon us that some big events are about to occur that will cause liberty to go into, quote,
[23:14.040 --> 23:22.440]  deep hibernation. Paul told the House, these fast approaching events will not go unnoticed.
[23:22.440 --> 23:27.160]  They will affect us all. They will not be limited to just some area of the country.
[23:27.160 --> 23:32.680]  The world economy and political system will share in the chaos about to be unleashed.
[23:32.680 --> 23:37.160]  There are reasons to believe this coming crisis is different and bigger than the world has ever
[23:37.160 --> 23:43.320]  experienced instead of using globalism in a positive fashion. It has been used to globalize
[23:43.320 --> 23:48.600]  all of the mistakes of the politicians, bureaucrats, and central bankers. That's nice to call it
[23:48.600 --> 23:54.360]  mistakes. Paul continued, in one of Paul's most memorable speeches today, the congressman spoke
[23:54.360 --> 23:59.720]  of rampant authoritarianism, having replaced the principles of liberty that the United States was
[23:59.720 --> 24:05.800]  founded upon and warned that current empire building financed through inflation and debt signals
[24:05.800 --> 24:11.800]  a more frightening period in history. Our arrogance and aggressiveness have been used to promote
[24:11.800 --> 24:18.840]  a world empire backed by the most powerful army of history. This type of globalist intervention
[24:18.840 --> 24:25.640]  creates problems for all citizens of the world and fails to contribute to the well-being of the
[24:25.640 --> 24:31.960]  world's populations. Just think of our own personal liberties have been trashed here at home in the
[24:31.960 --> 24:40.120]  last decade. Paul urged fellow representatives. Paul outlined the history of the current economic
[24:40.120 --> 24:45.720]  crisis and alluded to key events such as the inception of the Federal Reserve system, the
[24:45.720 --> 24:51.080]  creation of the Britain Woods monetary system, and the creation of the dollar bubble. The bubble
[24:51.080 --> 24:56.920]  is different and bigger for another reason Paul agreed and argued. The central banks of the world
[24:57.640 --> 25:04.680]  secretly collude to certainly plan the world economy. I'm convinced that agreements among
[25:04.680 --> 25:10.840]  central banks to monopolize US debt these past 15 years have existed. Well, we've gotten IMF World Bank
[25:10.840 --> 25:15.880]  documents that say that. Although secretly and out of the reach of any oversight of anyone,
[25:15.880 --> 25:20.920]  especially the US Congress, that doesn't care or just flat doesn't understand if they don't read
[25:20.920 --> 25:25.560]  most the bills. I had the chairman of the Texas Education Committee and the Texas legislature
[25:25.560 --> 25:32.200]  come up being a stakehouse last week in front of Aaron Dykes and another person that was with us
[25:32.200 --> 25:36.040]  and just say yeah they they they keep sneaking and slipping things in. I thought about the red
[25:36.040 --> 25:40.360]  light bill for Texas. They just slipped it into a transportation bill the day of the vote and it
[25:40.360 --> 25:44.920]  was made law. Yesterday the congressman also confronted Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke
[25:44.920 --> 25:49.480]  over what he described as a 35 plus year dollar bubble telling him you were probably the biggest
[25:49.480 --> 25:55.800]  taxpayer in the country, the biggest taxer in the country, citing the inflationary fiat money system
[25:55.800 --> 26:03.560]  as the most unfair and regressive form of taxation there is. A stunning and it it it it goes on.
[26:05.960 --> 26:09.640]  Again, we got a call from Benton right before the last break that we skipped saying Ron Paul
[26:09.640 --> 26:13.800]  was coming right now gave us a number but then that number wasn't good we're scrambling about.
[26:14.600 --> 26:16.680]  What's my ETA, John? You can come on there and tell us.
[26:18.120 --> 26:22.440]  All right, I was just told that he's not going to be able to make it now. They were just called
[26:22.440 --> 26:28.920]  into something so 1 p.m. between 1 and 2 he's going to be able to come on. And you're on air right
[26:28.920 --> 26:34.360]  now? Yes, I am. Okay, I want to make sure people hear me talking to someone that isn't there. He
[26:34.360 --> 26:42.680]  is there usually it's just that you can't hear him. So basically they called in to say hey
[26:42.680 --> 26:47.800]  quick we can come on right now do 20 minutes. So I called that number and then the lady informed
[26:47.800 --> 26:53.320]  me he just got you know pulled away so he's going to have to come on between 1 and 2 so he's just
[26:53.320 --> 26:59.000]  going to randomly call in some point today but he will be coming out today. You know I've got my
[26:59.000 --> 27:10.600]  guest list here today. Ron Paul, Jim Mars, Bob Chapman, Paul Craig Roberts. What I'll do is
[27:10.600 --> 27:16.440]  I'll just let those two be on air together I guess. Hey it's all transparent here we even on the
[27:16.440 --> 27:21.640]  internet now put out our behind-the-scenes live streamed everybody. I've been listening on the
[27:21.640 --> 27:26.600]  M4 War stream we skip a lot of breaks there and so you can hear all the battle planning here on
[27:26.600 --> 27:34.280]  air it's funny my detractors are so deceptive they take me talking to John or sometimes board
[27:34.280 --> 27:40.040]  off I have two really cool engineers they do it all well one of them is a full-blown engineer here
[27:40.040 --> 27:46.760]  in the office in Austin and I'll be talking to them on air but you can't hear them talking to me
[27:46.760 --> 27:52.760]  because it's on a back line and then the people go and edit it edit it like I'm talking to imaginary
[27:52.760 --> 27:57.720]  people and saying do you hear me do me do you hear me and you'd think that's obvious and only an
[27:57.720 --> 28:01.960]  idiot would would would not see through that you have to remember the general public some of them
[28:01.960 --> 28:06.760]  don't know where electricity comes from or what it is how many continents there are who the vice
[28:06.760 --> 28:14.760]  president is the three branches of government you would think that the fellow on well Jay Leno
[28:14.760 --> 28:20.360]  with Jay walking that he's out there looking for particularly dumb people he's not there are large
[28:20.360 --> 28:25.720]  segments of the population that that don't understand and I'm done I'm just making a mention
[28:25.720 --> 28:31.880]  every few days about this so people are aware of it because there's not just some overt ridiculous
[28:31.880 --> 28:37.640]  disinfo about me there's also a lot of people now editing things to make me sound totally crazy
[28:38.280 --> 28:43.800]  or to make it sound like I'm racist or to make it sound like I've said things I haven't said
[28:44.840 --> 28:50.360]  and a lot of mark government operatives are disinfo people it's just mass mental illness
[28:51.320 --> 28:56.520]  and people out on youtube and live leak and google video doing this but I don't want to get
[28:56.520 --> 29:00.120]  get off into a rampage about myself I don't particularly care about myself being attacked
[29:00.120 --> 29:06.680]  it's just that you know they go on the wikipedia page the people that control my page that are
[29:06.680 --> 29:13.000]  high-level wikipedia editors and say I've been killed or I'm or I'm I'm I'm on cocaine which
[29:13.000 --> 29:18.840]  I've never taken and don't like that's not true one time in a party when high school I did take
[29:18.840 --> 29:22.840]  it and thought I was gonna have a heart attack I did never liked our drugs but the point is just
[29:22.840 --> 29:27.800]  and they won't let us edit that or change that and they won't let there's a bunch of disinfo
[29:27.800 --> 29:33.640]  on there right now they won't let people change it so just be aware there's a lot of bull about me
[29:33.640 --> 29:40.200]  out there on the internet and it's meant because I'm effective and they want to
[29:40.760 --> 29:45.080]  basically kill the messenger politically which isn't working I'll tell you about all the big
[29:45.080 --> 29:52.520]  developments with uh willy nelson governor ventura and uh the concert we're on the march

[33:18.600 --> 33:28.360]  in the one o'clock hour he is so incredibly busy came very close to dying two nights ago
[33:30.360 --> 33:34.360]  they had to emergency land the aircraft with six other congressmen on board from texas
[33:35.880 --> 33:38.120]  depressurization would kill pain steward
[33:40.280 --> 33:46.200]  so ron paul's schedule also jim mar's huge breaking news about the fascist nazi connections
[33:46.200 --> 33:51.160]  this is a multi-headed hydra we go into all the heads of the hydra this is a historical fact you
[33:51.160 --> 33:56.840]  can't get around it those of you that just want to obsess on israel all day or obsess on the vatican
[33:56.840 --> 34:03.160]  all day or obsess on this or that all day we cover it all but we also get into the fact that
[34:03.800 --> 34:08.760]  the nazis did try to overthrow this country and the bushes were their henchmen that is an
[34:08.760 --> 34:13.720]  absolute admitted fact we're going to cover it with jim mar's we're going to look at that head
[34:13.720 --> 34:19.880]  of the hydra today uh and then bob chatman is on in the one o'clock hour when paul's coming on
[34:19.880 --> 34:24.200]  so we'll have chatman with us and i'm sure chatman will be happy to ride a long shotgun
[34:24.200 --> 34:29.080]  whenever paul comes in for 20 minutes and then dr paul craig roberts and then we're told paul may
[34:29.080 --> 34:34.280]  even shift to that hour but he's he's never bailed on me when this happens when he's on the campaign
[34:34.280 --> 34:39.960]  drill or in session uh but we were already setting this up last week and now the airplane disaster
[34:39.960 --> 34:44.600]  uh averted nearly diverted as a disaster with seven congressmen on board
[34:47.000 --> 34:53.560]  as the emperor tries to blow up the jedi council uh he will uh be uh on with us sometime today i
[34:53.560 --> 34:59.880]  would venture to save and they say they're coming on he's running around battling on the hill and
[34:59.880 --> 35:12.360]  trying to come back in to talk to us on air okay um here is the big update on willy nelson i think
[35:12.360 --> 35:17.320]  first we should play this from yesterday with the hour long exclusive interview with willy nelson
[35:17.320 --> 35:23.640]  on impeachment trying to stop an attack on iran and 911 truth uh here is the caller bringing
[35:23.640 --> 35:29.400]  up what i wouldn't bring up to willy and i've kind of analyzed why i wouldn't do this even though
[35:29.400 --> 35:34.680]  911 truth was asking me to because i you know know willy and got his number and he's a fan of the show
[35:36.280 --> 35:41.800]  he's a fan of freedom is because subconsciously i analyzed i self analyzed last night this morning
[35:41.800 --> 35:48.200]  i can't stand the anxiety and the butterflies of organizing this but now now that i'm committed
[35:48.200 --> 35:54.920]  i'm trying to make sure it happens and uh get her done with the infiltrators and problems and
[35:54.920 --> 36:00.120]  all the things that could be involved with this but um after we play two minutes of this clip
[36:00.120 --> 36:03.960]  i will come back and tell you where things stand right now here it is you've done a lot of great
[36:03.960 --> 36:09.640]  concerts in your time as far as like live aid to support the farmers i was thinking that would be
[36:09.640 --> 36:15.640]  great to do something like a 911 truth concert don't let the money to the families that lost the
[36:15.640 --> 36:22.600]  loved ones fire fighters that were out there and also to support jennifer spinach um what he's doing
[36:22.600 --> 36:27.160]  and would be great to do that again we get a lot of publicity i was wondering well i would agree
[36:27.160 --> 36:33.400]  i would agree to both of those things uh in a minute okay willy wonderful it's a wonderful plan
[36:33.400 --> 36:37.560]  willy i'm totally freaking out right now you know you gave me your cell phone number and other
[36:37.560 --> 36:41.000]  contacts and i haven't called you in five months because i'm you're one of the few people i'm
[36:41.000 --> 36:45.320]  actually star struck by and and i was kind of nervous stumbling around calling you this morning
[36:45.320 --> 36:50.360]  to come on the show i have been dreaming of inviting you to new york this year for the
[36:50.360 --> 36:55.160]  anniversary getting some hall just having you speak or you know play your acoustic guitar
[36:55.160 --> 37:00.280]  and we know the first responders the heads of the victims family groups or to even have a benefit
[37:01.320 --> 37:06.440]  here in austin for the firefighters and police but i know you're so busy and you've already done
[37:06.440 --> 37:13.080]  so much for 911 truth uh but since the caller brings it up uh maybe i should talk to you off
[37:13.080 --> 37:18.840]  air later today about doing something like that because i think we're talking about solutions
[37:18.840 --> 37:25.640]  or a free concert somewhere as a media event to say a no attack on iran uh yes to impeachment
[37:25.640 --> 37:30.920]  deal that might be good like a like it'd probably be like woodstock willy oh i think you're right
[37:30.920 --> 37:38.360]  and i think people want to find a way to speak out and let their voices be heard and that's what
[37:38.360 --> 37:44.600]  you and i need to do is to give them a way to do that uh we'll we'll find a hall or a field or
[37:44.600 --> 37:50.280]  something somewhere and we'll go go go over there and uh we'll give people a chance to stand up and
[37:50.280 --> 37:55.080]  talk about what they believe in i just want to thank scott calling from arizona who i don't know
[37:55.080 --> 38:01.160]  from adam because i just i just can't i can't ever ask for things from the celebrities i know
[38:01.160 --> 38:05.960]  just because i don't want to feel like i'm bugging them but willy gives so much this is just incredible
[38:06.600 --> 38:11.160]  for all the thank you and i want to say to scott before you take off to the mountains up there
[38:11.160 --> 38:16.440]  hang around a little while and uh and watch all this stuff come down and uh you know for something
[38:16.440 --> 38:22.280]  happens really bad i'll go to the mountains with you but in the meantime let's stand here and fight
[38:22.280 --> 38:25.400]  those guys all right we're gonna skip this break too here we go behind the scenes
[38:27.480 --> 38:29.480]  unbelievable okay so
[38:32.360 --> 38:37.960]  i am just energized all day yesterday couldn't go to bed until one o'clock in the morning also
[38:37.960 --> 38:49.080]  had a san diego radio interview but i did and so i get up this morning and it was time to call willy
[38:49.080 --> 38:54.520]  and i call him and he goes listen i just played a concert last night uh i'm just now waking up but
[38:54.520 --> 39:01.000]  but uh yeah i probably do want to do some type of concert we just have to figure out where we
[39:01.000 --> 39:05.160]  want to have it what we want to do and i need you to send me an email with your ideas and what you
[39:05.160 --> 39:12.360]  want to do and i said okay uh well let me just ask you now do you do you think you want to make it
[39:12.360 --> 39:21.000]  more anti-war or more 9-11 truth uh and i said you know do you want other people there do you want
[39:21.000 --> 39:25.240]  jesse ventura there do you want woody harrelson there uh do you want maybe to get charlie sheen
[39:25.240 --> 39:32.520]  there and he's like sure all of them and i said well just just so i know when i formulate a plan
[39:32.520 --> 39:36.520]  do you want to be in new york or austin what you know what's your gut tell you he said probably
[39:36.520 --> 39:44.360]  austin because it would probably be bigger uh and he's then went on to say that basically
[39:45.160 --> 39:50.840]  9-11 did happen seven years ago and that he wants it to be about 9-11 but mainly about
[39:50.840 --> 40:01.880]  not attacking iran impeachment bringing these people uh to justice
[40:02.920 --> 40:08.680]  because that has the widest appeal and then also talking about the first responders and what's
[40:08.680 --> 40:19.560]  happened to them and so it looks like but i don't want to jinx it that it's probably going to happen
[40:19.560 --> 40:27.240]  we just have to formulate it and try to get a venue big enough to do this uh the reason austin
[40:27.240 --> 40:35.080]  is prime also is because it's easier to get a big venue here and willy is just an icon worldwide but
[40:35.080 --> 40:42.520]  he's a the icon here in texas especially in central texas and so we've got to formulate something in
[40:42.520 --> 40:47.720]  the next week he's on tour very busy he's on tour like six days a week some days seven days a week
[40:47.720 --> 40:53.560]  all over the country he's got farm aid coming up uh in late september it looks like if we do it which
[40:53.560 --> 40:59.400]  it's probably going to happen folks i mean he's like 99% he's like well let's do something let's
[40:59.400 --> 41:03.560]  figure it out let's do it but i don't want to say it's a done deal i don't count my chickens till
[41:03.560 --> 41:07.480]  they're hatched i don't you know count the big fish till it's in the boat ladies and gentlemen
[41:07.480 --> 41:14.200]  and we're headed back to dock so this is very very exciting and i just appreciate willy's courage
[41:14.200 --> 41:22.600]  so then i go it's like 10 22 and it's less than 40 minutes before i'm on air i gotta drive 20
[41:22.600 --> 41:26.440]  minutes to get to work i'm gonna get ready all morning i get ready at home my home office
[41:27.240 --> 41:30.600]  i gotta get to the office i go i'm gonna call governor ventura right now
[41:33.160 --> 41:39.640]  so i pick up the phone i call governor ventura at home he answers he's like hey elix i just got a
[41:39.640 --> 41:45.640]  advanced copy of uh the new pearl harbour revisited it's an incredible book the best
[41:45.640 --> 41:49.000]  favorite book i've read and they want me to write it forward what do you think of this forward idea
[41:49.000 --> 41:54.520]  and read it to me and he's being so nice and talking about my films other films and i'm like
[41:54.520 --> 41:59.000]  well hey i know you're been down here with willy before with kinky freedman i know that um
[42:00.280 --> 42:04.200]  you had to help him with governorship you would you like to come down and speak at
[42:04.200 --> 42:09.720]  an anti-war slash 9 11 truth event uh willy's pretty much on board to do it we just got to organize
[42:09.720 --> 42:15.240]  it and you know and he said absolutely i want to come i just went to saw willy last week in
[42:15.240 --> 42:19.960]  hinkley minnesota i was in the 10th row tell him i said hi yeah as long as i can go out and play golf
[42:19.960 --> 42:29.960]  on on willy's golf course uh i'm there so that's so i call willy back real fast and now it's like
[42:29.960 --> 42:36.680]  35 after i barely got time to get into the office and willy's more awake now yeah yeah i'm like well
[42:36.680 --> 42:42.920]  what about ventura he's on board well great let's work it out let's get uh this guy and that guy
[42:44.920 --> 42:52.520]  but now i've got to i got to do all the work to make sure it uh happens or that um
[42:53.320 --> 42:57.080]  i don't approach things too directly or i just told willy you're in the driver's seat but at the
[42:57.080 --> 43:02.360]  same time then he's got to organize it i i don't know it's just amazing
[43:04.760 --> 43:09.160]  here's another issue i guarantee you folks for an anti-war slash 9 11 thing i bet we can get
[43:09.160 --> 43:14.600]  50 000 people i mean hell willy has events around austin all the time but 20 30 000 i don't know
[43:16.440 --> 43:21.960]  and then of course willy no doubt probably people around him telling him not to do that willy always
[43:21.960 --> 43:25.400]  does what he wants to do so he'll probably actually reverse that college and make sure it
[43:25.400 --> 43:29.480]  happens i i just it's sometimes they say it's better to have loved and lost and never loved at
[43:29.480 --> 43:33.960]  all but to love an event like this they're not ideal like this we talked about some other stuff
[43:33.960 --> 43:40.840]  i'm not going to get into it that's some exciting stuff but to now be worried about it now to be
[43:41.640 --> 43:47.240]  constantly we have even more energy and be more electrified it's torture it's a good kind of
[43:47.240 --> 43:53.000]  torture but it's like being in love when you're 14 and that's your first really serious girlfriend
[43:53.000 --> 43:55.880]  or something and you're just thinking about her all the time and you're worrying about her all the
[43:55.880 --> 44:00.440]  time you know when you get to be an old guy like me you know you love your wife but and there's
[44:00.440 --> 44:05.480]  deep fires burning for her but at the same time there's not that giddy excitement and that's the
[44:05.480 --> 44:12.840]  only other feeling i can explain this as i don't like it because i always have that dark burning
[44:12.840 --> 44:17.080]  passion to fight the new world order and and and it's dark but dark in a good way you know it's a
[44:17.080 --> 44:24.440]  brooding angry serious warlike thing but then to have just this passionate deal and its creativity
[44:24.440 --> 44:32.360]  it's almost like when i'm standing before a canvas that i prepared a week before i'm an oil painter
[44:34.360 --> 44:39.320]  and i'm standing before the canvas never have time to do it anymore and and it's that same
[44:39.320 --> 44:49.000]  nervousness about what am i going to paint an impressionistic a representational a is it going
[44:49.000 --> 44:58.520]  to be something that you know having that feeling right now it's just those title tectonic
[45:00.040 --> 45:05.640]  titan like energies that we all have seething exploding creativity and i have this new thing
[45:05.640 --> 45:12.760]  before me i mean how big an event do i get how do i get a venue uh do i have willy do it because
[45:12.760 --> 45:17.960]  he's got obviously more carte blanche do you know who do i try to get there
[45:21.080 --> 45:27.720]  what bands do i invite and then there's that lingering sort of damocles what a village is
[45:27.720 --> 45:30.920]  decides well i just don't think it's the right time to do it but he said he's pretty much going to
[45:30.920 --> 45:38.040]  do it i i just we're still in talks it's torture it's a good torture but it's a torture
[45:38.040 --> 45:42.120]  nevertheless i mean let me tell you it's going to feel good if we have this event
[45:43.400 --> 45:49.160]  and it goes off without a hitch and it's successful let me get it on c span and on
[45:49.160 --> 45:52.600]  national tv and it has a big effect another breakthrough moment
[45:54.760 --> 45:58.920]  and we get of support for first responders we've already done it so much come with with
[45:58.920 --> 46:05.240]  these events it's just destiny it's magic it's history and i'm then i can't believe
[46:05.240 --> 46:09.400]  that i just call up governor ventura and call up willy nelson and then i can call up
[46:10.840 --> 46:15.640]  former german defense ministers in italian i'm not going to get into that the point is
[46:16.760 --> 46:20.280]  it's i can't believe my life and then i can't believe the responsibility
[46:20.280 --> 46:29.560]  it's just mind-blowing i'm alex jones and i've got to carry the ball and i've got to do all this
[46:29.560 --> 46:35.720]  work because i do it for love of decency and honor and the beauty of it it's not ego folks i can't
[46:35.720 --> 46:42.760]  explain it it's a force much stronger let's go ahead and play this uh clip of jesse ventura on
[46:42.760 --> 46:47.240]  fox news and we'll go to break and come back and i'll get into other news please stay with us governor
[46:47.240 --> 46:52.680]  jesse ventura author of this book that was just out in april the call is the new york timespace so
[46:52.680 --> 46:57.800]  don't start the revolution without me uh governor ventura welcome back to fox and friends why didn't
[46:57.800 --> 47:04.040]  you pass a ordinance like this that would have had everyone measuring people's underwear uh because
[47:04.040 --> 47:09.400]  that's the private sector and i don't really believe it's government's place to be in nonsense like
[47:09.400 --> 47:15.080]  that and that's when most of our emails reflect governor welcome back i know you've decided not
[47:15.080 --> 47:20.280]  to run for the u.s. senate seat what was the ultimate reason why you said i'm not going to run against
[47:20.280 --> 47:26.200]  you're coming off our al franken well the ultimate reason was the change of lifestyle for me you know
[47:26.200 --> 47:32.040]  it's a very difficult job you put back in the limelight you become scheduled again i would have to
[47:32.040 --> 47:38.280]  move to washington uh that would split up my wife and i a great deal and at this point in my life i
[47:38.280 --> 47:46.120]  just turned 57 years old it's a six-year term uh six-year commitment is a long time to make and i
[47:46.120 --> 47:51.480]  just felt it wasn't right for me and it wasn't destiny for me to do it so jesse uh or governor
[47:51.480 --> 47:57.080]  ventura i learned my lesson uh governor ventura uh let me ask you when you see barack obama over
[47:57.080 --> 48:01.720]  in afghanistan iraq what are you looking for as a voter to find out whether this guy can be the
[48:01.720 --> 48:07.800]  commander in chief well first of all i'm not voting for barack obama and i'm not voting for john mccain
[48:07.800 --> 48:13.960]  uh many independents like me are left out of the system the two-party dictatorship as i like to call
[48:13.960 --> 48:21.560]  it and uh so i won't be voting for either of them but uh i think he's doing what is required of him
[48:21.560 --> 48:26.360]  he obviously is a positive thinker and feels he's going to be the next president of the united states
[48:26.360 --> 48:32.120]  which he well could be and it's important for him to go over there and get educated see what's
[48:32.120 --> 48:38.360]  happening on the ground so that he can make him important decisions like i hope he does and withdraw
[48:38.360 --> 48:44.440]  and pull us out of iraq what about afghanistan uh afghanistan is starting to flare up again and
[48:44.440 --> 48:49.960]  that's only happening because we never finished the job did we and would you as a special forces
[48:49.960 --> 48:56.360]  guy like the opportunity to go into pakistan and find bin laden uh i doubt of bin laden's even alive
[48:56.360 --> 49:03.560]  today i think he's just propped up as being that uh uh enemy that we all easy that we all have to
[49:03.560 --> 49:09.000]  have out there i'm not sure if he's even alive or not they had their chance to get him and they let
[49:09.000 --> 49:14.280]  him slip through so i and let's remember he used to work for the cia years ago who says he still
[49:14.280 --> 49:18.440]  doesn't they said he never worked for the cia but they were working with the mujahideen which
[49:18.440 --> 49:22.120]  he was a part of but no one ever remembers seeing him but i want to talk to you about what's in your
[49:22.120 --> 49:26.840]  book and that is he's a pretty hard wait wait he's a he's a pretty hard guy to miss isn't he six and
[49:26.840 --> 49:31.480]  a half feet tall well evidently he's uh he's hard he's hard enough to miss we haven't got him yet
[49:31.480 --> 49:37.160]  it's maddening but all about the money politics jesse yes we do uh we do want him we just got to
[49:37.160 --> 49:42.600]  go get him uh we'll go back with governor ventura who doesn't agree with anything anything i say but
[49:42.600 --> 49:49.320]  it makes him fun back in a moment he cut his hair i think so if you just missed it uh if you just
[49:49.320 --> 49:52.120]  missed the first half of our interview with jesse ventura we found out he's not going to vote for
[49:52.120 --> 49:55.720]  john mccain he's not going to vote for uh barack obama he's against the two-party system and he's
[49:55.720 --> 50:01.080]  not running for the u.s senate he also says we do not want usama bin laden what do you mean
[50:01.080 --> 50:07.240]  uh governor ventura who is also special forces guy well we had a chance to get him in torah
[50:07.240 --> 50:12.040]  borah and we left him and out which he escaped through and remember we need a boogie man out
[50:12.040 --> 50:17.080]  there we have to have some boogie man out there that we have to hate and then an enemy and if
[50:17.080 --> 50:23.880]  bin laden's dead or gone or we get him that boogie man doesn't exist anymore does it uh governor you
[50:23.880 --> 50:30.440]  want i find it very hard to believe with our technology the greatest fighting force in the
[50:30.440 --> 50:37.960]  world that if we truly wanted bin laden we would have gotten about this guy right in our country
[50:37.960 --> 50:44.920]  the olympic park bomber we couldn't find him well you know it uh they didn't use the u.s military
[50:44.920 --> 50:50.280]  to find them did they well i'll tell you what uh especially you you'd be suing somebody if you
[50:50.280 --> 50:56.120]  were 25 years old they'd be saying jesse we need you over in the mountains of afghanistan or pakistan
[50:56.120 --> 51:04.200]  to go find him you know how tough it is right every 22 seconds a violent crime is committed

[1:00:53.560 --> 1:00:58.280]  it is the church of life the church of decency and beauty and honor and truth and will and

[1:01:16.280 --> 1:01:21.960]  your good intentions go in a direction that helps your fellow man the lies are being torn aside the
[1:01:21.960 --> 1:01:26.760]  enemy is moving in with a high tech control grid because they realize the population of the planet
[1:01:26.760 --> 1:01:33.960]  is waking up to their tyranny and it is a desperate attempt to put us back in the line and it was
[1:01:33.960 --> 1:01:45.160]  destined from the foundations of creation to fail uh regardless of what happens
[1:01:46.280 --> 1:01:51.640]  we do the right thing we put ourselves in the way of the fist we stand up with courage and
[1:01:51.640 --> 1:01:59.800]  god will do the rest the enemy believes in god and they hate god the enemy tries to teach the
[1:01:59.800 --> 1:02:05.480]  mass not to be spiritual so they will be blinded and think that only materialism is the answer
[1:02:06.760 --> 1:02:09.640]  and so they will never fully develop into the creatures they were meant to be
[1:02:12.600 --> 1:02:16.280]  that's why the enemy puts out their fake organized religion and all its brands
[1:02:17.240 --> 1:02:22.760]  that's why they continually perpetually push things that are meant to turn the population off
[1:02:23.960 --> 1:02:28.680]  and to turn them inward into their television sets into their diversions and distractions that
[1:02:28.680 --> 1:02:35.320]  it will not fulfill you will never fulfill you fighting evil is the only thing that truly fulfills
[1:02:35.320 --> 1:02:40.360]  the struggle against tyranny the struggle against humanization the struggle for truth
[1:02:41.560 --> 1:02:46.040]  well the only pains i have is that so many people who wake up to the new world order then fall into
[1:02:46.040 --> 1:02:52.680]  subcategories and in fight with each other and are stunted by false teachers and false prophets and
[1:02:52.680 --> 1:02:56.840]  leaders that lead them into in fighting and disinformation and i'm so sad i don't even hate
[1:02:56.840 --> 1:03:02.920]  those people i feel sorry for them and wish that i could have communal brotherhood with them
[1:03:02.920 --> 1:03:08.520]  wish that i could have powwows with them wish that i could lift them up and they me up all of us
[1:03:08.520 --> 1:03:14.840]  together and it's not too late for some of you out there that have turned to darkness it's not too
[1:03:14.840 --> 1:03:20.200]  late for you to turn loose of your hate even for the new world order something i've had to learn how

[1:03:33.640 --> 1:03:38.840]  said that many people that actually fight tyranny only wish to be the tyranny themselves they have
[1:03:38.840 --> 1:03:44.600]  a subconscious dominance propulsion system that leads them against the establishment because
[1:03:44.600 --> 1:03:51.640]  they only want power mackey of ellie said it as well they only seek to fight the establishment
[1:03:51.640 --> 1:03:56.520]  because they want power themselves and that will lead you into ruination you need to fight evil

[1:10:16.360 --> 1:10:23.160]  rise of the fourth rite okay well i think it's kind of summed up here on page 323
[1:10:24.200 --> 1:10:30.040]  we're right that while it's true that the families that originated the wealthy elite in america
[1:10:30.040 --> 1:10:36.680]  the rockefellows the morgans the shifts the warburgs the herrimans the bushes uh have in recent years
[1:10:36.680 --> 1:10:43.880]  lost some of their previous influence their giant global imp imp enterprises today remain
[1:10:43.880 --> 1:10:49.720]  as powerful as ever maintaining all the functions for which they were first organized this mechanism
[1:10:49.720 --> 1:10:56.200]  today has been brought under the control of fascist globalists who created both communism
[1:10:56.200 --> 1:11:03.080]  and then national socialism and they've done this in america by using the wealth brought from europe
[1:11:03.080 --> 1:11:09.400]  through the nazi rat lines in other words the same people and the same corporations the same
[1:11:09.400 --> 1:11:16.440]  companies the same families the same wall street uh financiers who backrolled and supported
[1:11:16.440 --> 1:11:23.640]  communism in russia so that they could play that off against the capitalistic west uh communism
[1:11:23.640 --> 1:11:27.800]  threatened to get out of hand it threatened to go worldwide and they didn't want that because they
[1:11:27.800 --> 1:11:35.320]  want the turmoil and the wars and the uh conflict that can be created between nations so they can
[1:11:35.320 --> 1:11:43.000]  pit one nation against another for maximum control and profit so they created uh national
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:50.040]  socialism in uh pre-war germany and national socialism you have to understand the acronym
[1:11:50.040 --> 1:11:56.440]  of which is nazi uh they took the n a from national and the zi from the socialistic
[1:11:56.440 --> 1:12:02.440]  in the german and that's uh where the word nazi comes from they are national socialist and what
[1:12:02.440 --> 1:12:09.400]  we have in america today is national socialism of course they don't call it that day today they
[1:12:09.400 --> 1:12:16.040]  call it neo conservatism but what they've done is the same thing they did in pre-war germany
[1:12:16.040 --> 1:12:22.120]  they have appealed to the conservative the true conservative elements of the population
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:30.280]  and used that to ride into power and to push uh forward their national socialist programs it's
[1:12:30.280 --> 1:12:37.480]  like uh george w bush proclaimed himself a compassionate conservative a neo conservative
[1:12:37.480 --> 1:12:42.840]  and yet when he gets in office uh he has accumulated more power to the presidency more
[1:12:42.840 --> 1:12:50.200]  power to the central government uh he has led us into unprovoked foreign wars he has
[1:12:50.760 --> 1:12:56.440]  wrecked the economy uh and he has propagated more socialistic programs probably than any
[1:12:56.440 --> 1:13:00.920]  other president the federal government has asked yourself what's going on the federal government
[1:13:00.920 --> 1:13:07.800]  has tripled in size he's also effectively demonized probably for decades true conservatism and now
[1:13:07.800 --> 1:13:13.720]  they give us the false solution the left which will only bring us deeper under the same control and
[1:13:13.720 --> 1:13:19.640]  then we see the straussian uh school of economics uh up in chicago where the neocons come from
[1:13:19.640 --> 1:13:24.600]  where they openly write and say despite the fact a lot of them are zionist that they are using
[1:13:24.600 --> 1:13:31.640]  nazi governing principles from the black uniforms to the term rike or land security uh to uh the
[1:13:31.640 --> 1:13:38.680]  fascist symbols the nazi fasci and the hatchets on top the bundle of sticks in the senate uh
[1:13:39.880 --> 1:13:46.920]  passing the nazi gun control bills uh in the the 68 gun control act uh they are using this model
[1:13:47.800 --> 1:13:54.360]  absolutely and uh let me let's let's listen to the words of the the nazi luwafa commander
[1:13:54.360 --> 1:13:59.480]  herman gurring he said this that during the nuremberg war crime trials he said why of course
[1:13:59.480 --> 1:14:04.360]  the people don't want war that's understood but after all it's the leaders of the country
[1:14:04.360 --> 1:14:09.720]  who determine the policy and it's always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it's a
[1:14:09.720 --> 1:14:16.360]  democracy a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice
[1:14:16.360 --> 1:14:21.480]  the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders this is easy all you have to do is
[1:14:21.480 --> 1:14:27.960]  tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifist for lack of patriotism and exposing
[1:14:27.960 --> 1:14:32.920]  the country to danger doesn't that sound familiar and that's what carol quickly said he said we
[1:14:32.920 --> 1:14:38.520]  control fascists we control communist the global banking establishment wants a system for the
[1:14:38.520 --> 1:14:43.320]  administrative convenience of the international banking elite as rockefeller has echoed and
[1:14:43.320 --> 1:14:47.720]  that they work with anything that centralizes and then they give the public false choices of
[1:14:47.720 --> 1:14:53.960]  centralized communism or centralized fascism which are really the two of the same thing dressed up
[1:14:53.960 --> 1:15:00.840]  different exactly in fact national socialism by its very definition is socialism just as
[1:15:00.840 --> 1:15:08.680]  communism was an extreme form of socialism they they want socialism because any social program
[1:15:08.680 --> 1:15:15.080]  no matter how good it may be such as social security or no child left behind and that there
[1:15:15.080 --> 1:15:21.640]  no matter whether it's good bad or indifferent requires central administration and they believe
[1:15:21.640 --> 1:15:27.800]  that they have the wealth and the power to control the central administration and thus control our
[1:15:27.800 --> 1:15:35.880]  lives control the world it's the age old dream of of greedy ambitious people i have abc news today
[1:15:35.880 --> 1:15:41.160]  saying all americans with children will get cps visits and you will get them to make sure you
[1:15:41.160 --> 1:15:47.640]  are a quote good parent i have another report here also out of abc where they are saying that when
[1:15:47.640 --> 1:15:53.480]  you pay for gas you will have to show your id and driver's license and be registered to buy gas
[1:15:53.480 --> 1:15:58.440]  everything is about being tracked and controlled we are going in to an electronic straight jacket
[1:15:58.440 --> 1:16:03.720]  and notice the democrats connor's is trying to block a true hearing on its impeachment now friday
[1:16:03.720 --> 1:16:08.600]  that's just out today big articles up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com you see the
[1:16:08.600 --> 1:16:16.200]  democrats may intend to use all this power george bush is amassed for them exactly and and my question
[1:16:16.200 --> 1:16:23.000]  is well what's the problem with impeachment they impeach bill clinton for having sex for gosh sakes
[1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:28.920]  can we impeach somebody when millions of people have died and what's the problem if if they're
[1:16:28.920 --> 1:16:34.760]  innocent i mean impeachment is simply like a trial so we have in a trial and they lay out all the
[1:16:34.760 --> 1:16:39.800]  evidence and that the neocons can prove that they made a few mistakes but basically they're
[1:16:39.800 --> 1:16:44.200]  doing everything as they should have then what have they got to worry about why would they be
[1:16:44.200 --> 1:16:50.680]  concerned they are admittedly guilty on all of those 35 articles minus the global warming one
[1:16:50.680 --> 1:16:56.840]  that deniz kasinich has brought forward on the face it's all felonies and lies and premeditated
[1:16:56.840 --> 1:17:03.480]  and so it's open and shut and that's why they can't allow an impeachment yes that's true that's
[1:17:03.480 --> 1:17:07.640]  absolutely true that's what kind of what i was getting at if they really didn't have anything to
[1:17:07.640 --> 1:17:12.280]  worry about if they were adhering to the law and to the constitution then they shouldn't have anything
[1:17:12.280 --> 1:17:18.520]  to worry about the fact that they're fighting tooth and toenail even using some democrats to try to
[1:17:18.520 --> 1:17:25.240]  stop any kind of impeachment hearing uh shows that they're obviously guilty of sin conures and of
[1:17:25.240 --> 1:17:32.280]  course um we have on top of that uh pelosi absolute monsters uh now now i want to go
[1:17:32.280 --> 1:17:35.800]  through the book obviously people need to get the book but you've got some bombshell stuff
[1:17:35.800 --> 1:17:40.600]  for people that don't know let's give them the basic history of uh the fascist idea how they
[1:17:40.600 --> 1:17:44.920]  tried to overthrow the u.s. smithley butler the marine corps commander two-time congressional
[1:17:44.920 --> 1:17:52.680]  medal of honor winner the general brigadier general refused to go along with that um he was
[1:17:52.680 --> 1:17:57.800]  about to become general smithley butler that had them of the marine corps and and wouldn't take it
[1:17:57.800 --> 1:18:02.440]  because they wanted him to lead a 500 000 man team we have the McCormick-dickstein committee
[1:18:02.440 --> 1:18:09.000]  hearings on all of that i want to walk through this through bush seniors daddy senator prescott
[1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:12.120]  right through to what we face today but let's start now
[1:18:12.120 --> 1:18:22.760]  jim well let's start with let's start with germany and early in january of 1933 it was a democratic
[1:18:22.760 --> 1:18:30.600]  republic it was the weimar republic uh just like we had at one time the uh republic of the united
[1:18:30.600 --> 1:18:38.840]  states and yet uh before the end of the month uh or i think it was february of 1933 their parliament
[1:18:38.840 --> 1:18:46.440]  building burned down the right stock february 27th yes and uh it quite conveniently they
[1:18:46.440 --> 1:18:53.160]  caught a retarded dutch youth uh who had was carrying on his personally communist party
[1:18:53.160 --> 1:18:58.520]  card just kind of like on 9 11 when all the planes and the hijackers and all those people
[1:18:58.520 --> 1:19:04.360]  just burned up but they found a paper passport that they said belonged to one of the hijackers
[1:19:04.360 --> 1:19:10.200]  so they said hitler who at that time was chancellor which is somewhat like our vice president he said
[1:19:10.200 --> 1:19:15.480]  well give me the power and i will you know protect you from these communist terrorists
[1:19:15.480 --> 1:19:20.200]  and of course it later came out that uh basically the kind of the nazis themselves
[1:19:20.200 --> 1:19:26.440]  it's at the fire luring but yes because uh it could be tracked back to gearing's office
[1:19:27.000 --> 1:19:33.720]  and then but using that as a pretext they rushed through emergency legislation the enabling act
[1:19:33.720 --> 1:19:40.040]  just like they rushed through the patriot act for us and they began to consolidate power within the
[1:19:40.040 --> 1:19:45.640]  government and before long hitler had combined the offices of president and vice president

[1:24:02.520 --> 1:24:07.320]  okay jim mars new book the rise of the fourth right coming out the next segment ron paul is
[1:24:07.320 --> 1:24:12.360]  with us for only this segment but he'll be back with us next week only five minutes right now to
[1:24:12.360 --> 1:24:17.880]  cover a lot of things congressman first off tell us what happened briefly on the aircraft when it
[1:24:17.880 --> 1:24:26.040]  depressurized well you know um it was obviously a uh a significant event because it's uh not very
[1:24:26.040 --> 1:24:31.640]  often that all of a sudden you see all these uh oxygen mask fall down in your face and actually
[1:24:31.640 --> 1:24:36.040]  the people did pretty well they remain calm everybody grabbed it and started breathing and
[1:24:36.040 --> 1:24:41.400]  and we knew it was a real thing at least i noticed that uh the uh uh stewardesses and
[1:24:41.400 --> 1:24:46.040]  the attendees um didn't get up to check on anybody they immediately sat down got their
[1:24:46.040 --> 1:24:51.720]  oxygen on so it was very very necessary that we get the oxygen because we were at 35 000 feet
[1:24:52.520 --> 1:24:56.920]  sometimes it was described as a nosedive but i wouldn't have described it being that dramatic it
[1:24:56.920 --> 1:25:01.960]  was obvious that we were doing going down quickly and then they uh took about 20 minutes or so
[1:25:01.960 --> 1:25:10.120]  to uh get into new orleans and and and that was it so uh it it was dangerous but it was uh it occurred
[1:25:10.120 --> 1:25:16.120]  rather quickly and it was over and nobody panicked okay you've got a special uh emergency hearing
[1:25:16.120 --> 1:25:23.960]  today on oil that tell us about that we have a special hearing today to study uh the relationship
[1:25:23.960 --> 1:25:28.280]  of the weak dollar and oil prices and this was at my request because they're always talking about
[1:25:28.280 --> 1:25:36.280]  about all kinds of things you know uh things like uh speculators and and arabs and everything in the
[1:25:36.280 --> 1:25:41.240]  world about um the oil price but they never talk about the fact that the dollar gets weaker and we
[1:25:41.240 --> 1:25:49.000]  print too many so uh barney frank who's chairman of the banking committee uh did uh respond to my
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:52.840]  request and we're holding hearings and which will start here probably within 20 minutes or so
[1:25:52.840 --> 1:25:59.320]  so you're getting ready for that right on the iran front uh last week you uh told the congress that
[1:25:59.880 --> 1:26:04.040]  really big things are about to happen really serious things that are unprecedented
[1:26:04.680 --> 1:26:08.760]  in modern history can you uh specifically tell us what you're talking about well in a way it's
[1:26:08.760 --> 1:26:13.320]  related to foreign policy but not specifically it wasn't like i knew in one week or two weeks
[1:26:13.320 --> 1:26:18.360]  something uh major was happening like the bombing of iran although that hangs over the market
[1:26:18.360 --> 1:26:22.920]  but most of the thoughts going through my mind was the relationship of foreign policy on how
[1:26:22.920 --> 1:26:28.680]  it's draining us and bankrupting us and the critical problems that we have in the financial
[1:26:28.680 --> 1:26:35.080]  sector today and i think they continue to exist and uh i dwell on the dollar because all we do
[1:26:35.080 --> 1:26:39.640]  up here just like yesterday hundreds of billions of dollars allotted to bailout the housing
[1:26:39.640 --> 1:26:44.040]  program that puts weight on the dollar and the dollar is going to go down so we can expect a
[1:26:44.040 --> 1:26:49.320]  lot of inflation and a very weak economy and i think we're seeing the beginning of a major
[1:26:49.320 --> 1:26:54.840]  major economic event they have tried to cover up the fact that control corporate press as you know
[1:26:54.840 --> 1:26:59.720]  sir um that the dollar is imploding now people finally seem to be waking up to that is that a
[1:26:59.720 --> 1:27:05.240]  good thing to put pressure on the central government uh to try to reverse policies that are killing the
[1:27:05.240 --> 1:27:10.920]  dollar well on the short term that there there's going to be a little bit pain with that when
[1:27:10.920 --> 1:27:15.960]  you reverse it if you try to save the dollar yeah this is going to be painful but ultimately that's
[1:27:15.960 --> 1:27:21.640]  the only thing you should be doing because uh if you don't do that everybody's going to suffer a
[1:27:21.640 --> 1:27:26.360]  lot more than anybody ever dreamed of i mean you can keep propping up system trying to reinflate the
[1:27:26.360 --> 1:27:31.160]  bubble try to take care of everybody receiving welfare checks but what happens when the money
[1:27:31.160 --> 1:27:37.400]  doesn't buy anything so uh we lose our way it won't solve our problems my major economic event
[1:27:37.400 --> 1:27:42.920]  we're already seeing those daily as jobs are lost and and energy goes up and all sorts of problems
[1:27:42.920 --> 1:27:46.760]  happen all related to the dollar and our debt uh what are you talking about i mean can you
[1:27:46.760 --> 1:27:50.920]  specifically tell us what type of major event you're talking about well i think with the dollar
[1:27:50.920 --> 1:27:56.040]  essentially doesn't function anymore and you know uh more runs on the bank i mean just yesterday
[1:27:56.040 --> 1:27:59.960]  with that housing bill you know they inside that bill they decided they're going to start
[1:27:59.960 --> 1:28:05.480]  fingerprinting anybody who's in the mortgage business as as a supposed solution to our problem
[1:28:05.480 --> 1:28:12.600]  also in that bill they have uh the new law that says that every single credit card a transaction
[1:28:12.600 --> 1:28:17.720]  will be reported to the irs they raised the national debt by 800 unbelievable billion dollars
[1:28:17.720 --> 1:28:22.680]  but this whole thing about you know this reporting of every credit card transaction
[1:28:22.680 --> 1:28:26.440]  so maybe people will quit using their credit cards and start going to cash in this could
[1:28:26.440 --> 1:28:31.880]  have all kinds of ramifications have you seen the bill where they want to send cps to all parents
[1:28:31.880 --> 1:28:37.400]  homes at birth i did not see that bill in particular now world that daily's got it it seems like
[1:28:38.040 --> 1:28:42.360]  government the status they're making their move right now yeah no they are and they're
[1:28:42.360 --> 1:28:47.400]  going to always react in the wrong way they've created problems mesas the great austrian economist
[1:28:47.400 --> 1:28:52.040]  said you know governments act they create trying to solve one problem to create two new ones and
[1:28:52.040 --> 1:28:58.360]  they go and try to solve those and just appear amid the the uh complexity of our problems congressman
[1:28:58.360 --> 1:29:04.040]  the rally bomb tell us about that rally bomb is occurring tomorrow we want to really send a
[1:29:04.040 --> 1:29:11.320]  strong message we've uh uh rented a an auditorium up there that could hold 15-18 000 and some of
[1:29:11.320 --> 1:29:15.480]  my staff's optimistic to think that we can sell all the tickets in one day a total of 17 dollars
[1:29:15.480 --> 1:29:21.400]  and 17 seconds 76 cents per ticket i'm always cautious about this i don't know what's gonna
[1:29:21.400 --> 1:29:25.880]  happen but they want to send a loud message so if we fill that place up and what website
[1:29:25.880 --> 1:29:30.040]  do they visit for the rally bomb pardon me what website do they really visit for the rally bomb

[1:34:17.400 --> 1:34:23.000]  finish up we're getting into his new incredible book rise of the fourth rike we had gotten up to
[1:34:23.000 --> 1:34:29.640]  hitler seizing power through stage terrorism um jim marz the best-selling author please continue
[1:34:30.600 --> 1:34:36.040]  well what you have to understand is that hitler wasn't able to take over germany just
[1:34:36.040 --> 1:34:46.280]  just by himself or by a handful of people uh in uh in german industry uh the banks that bank
[1:34:46.280 --> 1:34:53.960]  rolled them and the dawg's plan and the young plan which generally pushed the germans into hitlers
[1:34:53.960 --> 1:35:00.280]  and for all products of jp morgan uh the german corporations who are all behind hitler or of
[1:35:00.280 --> 1:35:10.040]  course the the ones you would think i g farben's icon posh damlar ben's crop alliance uh insurance
[1:35:10.040 --> 1:35:14.600]  which by the way was one of the insurance companies that insured and made lots of money off the
[1:35:14.600 --> 1:35:20.600]  destruction of the uh world trade center they were in collaboration and business relationships
[1:35:20.600 --> 1:35:28.920]  with standard all of new jersey jp morgan brown brothers airman jf ibm ibm for example ibm uh
[1:35:28.920 --> 1:35:34.280]  it closed their berlin office during war war two but they kept their war saw office open
[1:35:34.280 --> 1:35:40.520]  and it was through the war saw office respite re uh answering directly to their new york office
[1:35:40.520 --> 1:35:47.160]  where they process the punch cards for ibm machines that allowed the nazis to round up
[1:35:47.160 --> 1:35:52.600]  dissidents and jews and everybody else and get them on the trains to the concentration camps
[1:35:52.600 --> 1:35:57.800]  on time and what people don't realize is is that yes we defeated the germans
[1:35:57.800 --> 1:36:04.760]  in world war two but none of these people at that level at the business level none of them
[1:36:04.760 --> 1:36:12.680]  were ever charged none of them ever saw any any problem in fact uh a general motors plant which
[1:36:12.680 --> 1:36:17.080]  finally towards end of war because it was cranking out war materials finally was bombed
[1:36:17.080 --> 1:36:22.600]  by the u.s air force and after the war general motors sued the u.s government and won reparations
[1:36:22.600 --> 1:36:28.040]  and were was repaid for the loss of their uh manufacturing plant there in germany which
[1:36:28.040 --> 1:36:33.560]  had been producing war materials to kill our boys by the way jm is still in europe it's called opal
[1:36:34.360 --> 1:36:40.520]  right right and it's all it's all there in fact when you look at the world at the world's situation
[1:36:40.520 --> 1:36:49.160]  today we see that the nazis are not very far uh behind most everything we have a new pope uh who
[1:36:49.160 --> 1:36:55.560]  as a youth in poland was a member of the hitler youth and by the way you would think that italy
[1:36:56.440 --> 1:37:01.080]  has free speech you are arrested there if you write about that on the internet or in a newspaper
[1:37:01.080 --> 1:37:07.000]  you can look that up if you talk about rat singer being a hitler youth and now tony blairs become
[1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:13.400]  and i'm not attacking catholics it's just a fact folks and they are there yeah today you try to
[1:37:13.400 --> 1:37:19.080]  bring out truth and somehow they twisted around to making it a hate crime you know i don't have
[1:37:19.080 --> 1:37:23.160]  hate the pope i don't wish him ill i'm simply pointing out that he was a hitler youth and
[1:37:23.160 --> 1:37:28.680]  that's true but but and then let me expand on that let's let well let's stay on uh the catholic
[1:37:28.680 --> 1:37:34.280]  church for a moment but i want to go back first james this is so important the entire nazi mechanism
[1:37:34.280 --> 1:37:38.840]  as lord millner wrote royal history of international affairs as you know if they were seeing in the
[1:37:38.840 --> 1:37:44.840]  20s we need some hothead to take over fascism tear europe up so they could then suck it dry
[1:37:44.840 --> 1:37:52.040]  so hitler was just like the venom a spider injects into a bug to liquefy europe bring down its
[1:37:52.040 --> 1:37:58.280]  middle class and then as sangly ate it suck it dry back into england and the united states through
[1:37:58.280 --> 1:38:02.760]  the anglo-american establishment you have the sax cobert gothers and by the way i'm half german
[1:38:02.760 --> 1:38:06.360]  folks i'm not bashing germans it's the german elite we're not bashing germans either here
[1:38:06.360 --> 1:38:11.160]  we don't want to get into balkanization or it's just a fact that uh that we're laying out here
[1:38:11.160 --> 1:38:16.120]  so so basically germany was used to tear up bring down europe beat up communism
[1:38:16.120 --> 1:38:20.760]  there there are other creation that had gotten a bit out of control and to bring them back to heal
[1:38:20.760 --> 1:38:27.480]  and then to suck all that wealth uh from from looting europe back into uh the handful of the
[1:38:27.480 --> 1:38:33.240]  fortune ten in england and the united states and that is now exactly what they did they also took
[1:38:33.240 --> 1:38:39.400]  the all the brain trust of the nazi technicians engineers scientists and took them back as your
[1:38:39.400 --> 1:38:43.560]  book covers that's what the audience understand that it isn't like the nazis came over here and took
[1:38:43.560 --> 1:38:49.240]  over that the nazis were the creation of the people running the united states in england
[1:38:49.240 --> 1:38:55.560]  and so they basically use the nazis as their device uh to implode europe is that an accurate
[1:38:55.560 --> 1:39:01.960]  statement that's absolutely correct alex i'm glad you got that a lot of people see my title the rise
[1:39:01.960 --> 1:39:07.000]  of the fourth rite and they read about the nazi rat lines and how that they got over here on
[1:39:07.000 --> 1:39:12.760]  vatican passports and that and they have the idea that oh well it's some sort of german nazis
[1:39:12.760 --> 1:39:20.360]  that came over and took over the united states no it is the financial elite the wealthy oligarchy
[1:39:20.360 --> 1:39:26.840]  that created first communism and then got fearful of communism created national socialism or the
[1:39:26.840 --> 1:39:34.520]  nazis you're absolutely correct in fact they were the these globalists as they call themselves
[1:39:34.520 --> 1:39:43.640]  realized by nineteen uh late 1940 that joseph stalin who had taken control over communism in russia
[1:39:44.200 --> 1:39:51.880]  was threatening to invade europe and conquer europe for communism he had he had realized
[1:39:51.880 --> 1:39:59.560]  that nobody in europe was going to uh... voluntarily vote communism in so he was prepared to launch a
[1:39:59.560 --> 1:40:08.440]  massive assault on europe in july of 1941 mother also only force the only force that could possibly
[1:40:08.440 --> 1:40:14.520]  have resisted this was the german army and yet they were so vastly outnumbered particularly in
[1:40:14.520 --> 1:40:20.520]  tanks the russian's had twenty two thousand tanks and the germans had three thousand six hundred
[1:40:20.520 --> 1:40:27.240]  that the only option left was for hitler to launch a preemptive strike in june of 1941
[1:40:27.240 --> 1:40:32.760]  what she did with operation barbara osa and this explains how the germans were able to crash
[1:40:32.760 --> 1:40:37.880]  through the russian lines and encircle whole armies because the russians were in jump off
[1:40:37.880 --> 1:40:43.880]  offensive positions not defensive they were already forward they did blitzkrieg and and did
[1:40:43.880 --> 1:40:49.080]  in runs around their supply lines exactly and and that's why they when they grabbed
[1:40:49.640 --> 1:40:53.800]  a hindrack him or british intelligence they immediately killed him because they were in
[1:40:53.800 --> 1:40:58.520]  secret communication this is now been declassified the entire time with the british saying why did
[1:40:58.520 --> 1:41:04.600]  you double cross us this was all a set up deal we had that's why hess flew in and parachuted down
[1:41:04.600 --> 1:41:08.760]  onto one of the castles trying and then they grabbed him and locked him up in the tower
[1:41:08.760 --> 1:41:15.240]  saying what are you doing why are you doing this we had a deal it exactly and then when
[1:41:15.240 --> 1:41:20.600]  had when they did try to move hess out of england to uh... form a
[1:41:20.600 --> 1:41:26.040]  a new british government that would overthrow church hill in the war party and try to bring
[1:41:26.040 --> 1:41:32.840]  peace between england and germany uh... the plane crashed in hess apparently was killed
[1:41:32.840 --> 1:41:39.000]  so they couldn't admit to any of this so they had a brainwashed patsey who served the rest of his
[1:41:39.000 --> 1:41:45.800]  life in spandau prison and the reason i say a brainwashed patsey is because alan dullis who
[1:41:45.800 --> 1:41:50.840]  had been an integral part of all of this since the time he represented hitler and uh... the
[1:41:50.840 --> 1:41:57.800]  schroeder bank and uh... backer of hitler uh... sent a doctor you and cameron to inspect hess
[1:41:57.800 --> 1:42:04.840]  in spandau after the war uh... because he said he thought this was an imposter and hess had known
[1:42:04.840 --> 1:42:11.560]  scars from wounds in war war one and he wanted cameron to go and see if it was it well and and
[1:42:11.560 --> 1:42:18.040]  interestingly enough the british who were garden hess at the time refused to let him inspect hess
[1:42:18.040 --> 1:42:24.200]  but the key thing there is that any competent doctor could have checked for scar tissue on hess
[1:42:24.200 --> 1:42:31.000]  why did he send dr u and cameron because dr cameron was a mind control expert and by the way this
[1:42:31.000 --> 1:42:36.200]  is even on the history channel in the sixties tens of thousands of people the mk alter program in
[1:42:36.200 --> 1:42:41.240]  canada it's all admitted and that's why they use german mind control scientists after that
[1:42:41.240 --> 1:42:45.720]  understand the king of england was a nazi when the war started he had to get out of germany
[1:42:45.720 --> 1:42:51.320]  through spain they had a totally different plan that's why suddenly uh... the german princeling
[1:42:51.320 --> 1:42:55.640]  now the head of the house of orange married to queen betricks uh... founder of the bill
[1:42:55.640 --> 1:43:02.600]  de berg uh... group and also a vatican agent he had uh... to then escape uh... out of the country
[1:43:02.600 --> 1:43:07.320]  and of course you can tell people about who that is well that uh... of course that's uh... yeah
[1:43:07.320 --> 1:43:12.360]  prince barnhardt of the netherlands and interestingly enough which i'll read my new book the rise of
[1:43:12.360 --> 1:43:19.080]  the fourth right is that the very night that uh... the british royal uh... family member
[1:43:19.080 --> 1:43:24.600]  an officer who was going to fly with hess for the peace treaty and was killed
[1:43:24.600 --> 1:43:30.200]  in the plane subsequent plane crash uh... he had dinner with prince barnhardt of the netherlands
[1:43:30.200 --> 1:43:35.160]  which uh... uh... i don't know if that proves that there was some connection between barnhardt
[1:43:35.160 --> 1:43:40.120]  and the crash or but it certainly shows that the level at which this uh...
[1:43:40.120 --> 1:43:45.560]  this global politicking was taken place yes of and everything you're saying admitted
[1:43:45.560 --> 1:43:51.240]  historical fact understand all documented fact this is not debatable that's why hitler at duncork
[1:43:51.240 --> 1:43:56.840]  let the british evacuate and only a small show with gearing and some aircraft bombing with stuchas
[1:43:57.640 --> 1:44:03.160]  the the game plan was for britain to ally with germany and to stop communism
[1:44:03.160 --> 1:44:06.200]  uh... but once hitler had stopped
[1:44:06.200 --> 1:44:11.480]  uh... the communist uh... in uh... the summer of nineteen forty one was triple crossed
[1:44:11.480 --> 1:44:16.360]  he was triple crossed and they turned on him because they did not want a global
[1:44:16.360 --> 1:44:21.720]  national socialist uh... uh... system either they wanted a
[1:44:21.720 --> 1:44:24.520]  balkanized system of socialist
[1:44:24.520 --> 1:44:29.640]  uh... nations that they could play off against each other and that is a great game
[1:44:29.640 --> 1:44:34.200]  the great game of the invisible british imperium exactly
[1:44:34.200 --> 1:44:37.880]  uh... it is it's all uh... uh...
[1:44:37.880 --> 1:44:42.760]  mega politics and then they they decided that because of the wealth
[1:44:42.760 --> 1:44:49.400]  and because of the uh... uh... vast amount of resources in the united states they
[1:44:49.400 --> 1:44:52.680]  would simply move operations to the united states
[1:44:52.680 --> 1:44:56.440]  so they came over here they begin to buy up corporations that
[1:44:56.440 --> 1:45:01.080]  bigger the corporations got the more they bought up and suddenly by nineteen forty
[1:45:01.080 --> 1:45:01.960]  seven
[1:45:01.960 --> 1:45:05.640]  our military gets death sets put on their tanks and uniforms everything starts
[1:45:05.640 --> 1:45:09.960]  shifting they bring uh... the uh... symbol of fascia into the senate
[1:45:09.960 --> 1:45:13.960]  it all converts that's right and today we see the
[1:45:13.960 --> 1:45:18.920]  our troops are wearing the nazi cold skull helmets which they dubbed the fritz
[1:45:18.920 --> 1:45:24.040]  uh... we see imperial eagles uh... all over on our posted stamps and
[1:45:24.040 --> 1:45:27.320]  in our advertisements and symbols of the government
[1:45:27.320 --> 1:45:31.480]  an eagle drawn by hitler he drew the eagle he drew the first volts wagon
[1:45:31.480 --> 1:45:35.640]  the people's car uh... he drew the olympic rings it is all the mind of atall
[1:45:35.640 --> 1:45:37.800]  hitler and then let's expand on that
[1:45:37.800 --> 1:45:40.520]  because if you compartmentalize it down to just the vatican
[1:45:40.520 --> 1:45:43.320]  we compartmentalize it just down to british imperium
[1:45:43.320 --> 1:45:46.360]  you you compartmentalize it and they went again
[1:45:46.360 --> 1:45:50.440]  we have the zionist funding and and helping hitler and demanding ransoms
[1:45:50.440 --> 1:45:51.800]  from jews to leave
[1:45:51.800 --> 1:45:55.720]  having jews in new york lobby to not let you this is all mainline history
[1:45:55.720 --> 1:45:59.560]  uh... big jewish scholars written about it not to leave germany only to go
[1:45:59.560 --> 1:46:03.560]  uh... to palestine in the build up there with the british then in the rough
[1:46:03.560 --> 1:46:07.480]  child and so then when you look at this it is a master plan
[1:46:07.480 --> 1:46:11.400]  with interbred nazis british and zionist together
[1:46:11.400 --> 1:46:14.840]  and they're all occultists at the top and then meanwhile most of our movement
[1:46:14.840 --> 1:46:18.200]  fights about whether it's protestants jews catholics any of this
[1:46:18.200 --> 1:46:22.600]  when all the people themselves are good it's evil at the top of every major
[1:46:22.600 --> 1:46:24.040]  mechanism
[1:46:24.040 --> 1:46:27.400]  uh... that's uh... essentially correct and uh...
[1:46:27.400 --> 1:46:29.640]  if you don't go along
[1:46:29.640 --> 1:46:33.320]  well then they buy you out and if that doesn't work then they come and
[1:46:33.320 --> 1:46:36.680]  intimidate you out and if that doesn't work then they just kill you
[1:46:36.680 --> 1:46:41.400]  it's not see methodology and we see the same thing going on in this country
[1:46:41.400 --> 1:46:42.280]  because
[1:46:42.280 --> 1:46:46.440]  uh... the thing that in nineteen january of nineteen forty five german war
[1:46:46.440 --> 1:46:48.920]  production was actually at higher levels
[1:46:48.920 --> 1:46:52.840]  than it had been in nineteen forty when they were at the top of their game
[1:46:52.840 --> 1:46:56.120]  why is that because two things historians tell us
[1:46:56.120 --> 1:47:00.360]  number one the german people were propagandized at their media told them
[1:47:00.360 --> 1:47:03.960]  everything looks bad now but it's going to get better we have secret weapons
[1:47:03.960 --> 1:47:05.880]  coming we're going to turn this around
[1:47:05.880 --> 1:47:09.160]  uh... be patriotic go to work and they did
[1:47:09.160 --> 1:47:12.280]  uh... and then the second thing is secret terror
[1:47:12.280 --> 1:47:15.640]  if you try to stand up and say hey something's gone wrong here we
[1:47:15.640 --> 1:47:17.480]  you know then you were the fetus
[1:47:17.480 --> 1:47:21.720]  uh... and uh... you'd be arrested by the gestapo and you disappeared
[1:47:21.720 --> 1:47:25.080]  okay we've got the same thing in this country today we've got a
[1:47:25.080 --> 1:47:29.160]  news media that's under the control of five international corporations
[1:47:29.160 --> 1:47:33.880]  which keeps telling us everything's okay uh... we might have a little bit of a
[1:47:33.880 --> 1:47:38.680]  recession going and uh... and at the same time we have secret terror
[1:47:38.680 --> 1:47:40.760]  uh... just like uh... uh...

[1:48:43.720 --> 1:48:47.800]  of the globalist control and and and and and and and then project forward into
[1:48:47.800 --> 1:48:52.120]  the future and bring in the bushes and the rest of it

[1:48:54.600 --> 1:48:58.280]  oh well um...
[1:48:58.280 --> 1:48:59.880]  after the war
[1:48:59.880 --> 1:49:01.960]  the same people who had
[1:49:01.960 --> 1:49:05.160]  been instrumental in financing hitler
[1:49:05.160 --> 1:49:09.320]  john j mccloy of national city bank which is now city corp
[1:49:09.320 --> 1:49:12.840]  uh... joh allen dulles who uh... was
[1:49:12.840 --> 1:49:16.520]  always chief in switzerland in the war and then moved to berlin and then came
[1:49:16.520 --> 1:49:19.640]  over here and began a uh... it was the longest
[1:49:19.640 --> 1:49:25.080]  uh... serving c i a director and his brother john foster dulles who became
[1:49:25.080 --> 1:49:27.960]  secretary of state under dwight asenhower
[1:49:27.960 --> 1:49:30.440]  and uh... uh... under these folks
[1:49:30.440 --> 1:49:34.520]  they pardoned and whitewash the nazi backgrounds of thousands
[1:49:34.520 --> 1:49:38.120]  of nazis and actually brought them into the united states
[1:49:38.120 --> 1:49:43.560]  now we know that we brought in all their rocket scientist berna von brown who
[1:49:43.560 --> 1:49:47.320]  headed the marshall space center and uh... was instrumental in
[1:49:47.320 --> 1:49:51.880]  getting us to the moon uh... we also know there were other top nazi such as
[1:49:51.880 --> 1:49:56.200]  general walter darn burger of the luke waffa who came over and ended up as a
[1:49:56.200 --> 1:50:00.600]  vice president of bell helicopter and then but there were thousands of others
[1:50:00.600 --> 1:50:02.920]  including the man control experts
[1:50:02.920 --> 1:50:06.520]  and their pharmaceutical experts and people who worked with the i g
[1:50:06.520 --> 1:50:07.560]  farman
[1:50:07.560 --> 1:50:10.680]  uh... chemical combine and they all came into this country
[1:50:10.680 --> 1:50:14.280]  and we're rolled into a military industrial complex which
[1:50:14.280 --> 1:50:18.440]  whitehousand how are warned us about as he was leaving office
[1:50:18.440 --> 1:50:21.320]  and then they slowly begin to just take over
[1:50:21.320 --> 1:50:25.480]  uh... the national security apparatus of the united states and turn this into a
[1:50:25.480 --> 1:50:27.720]  national security state
[1:50:27.720 --> 1:50:29.720]  which is what we have today
[1:50:29.720 --> 1:50:33.480]  and uh... i guess probably one of the key things that happened
[1:50:33.480 --> 1:50:37.240]  was in september of nineteen forty seven when harry truman signed the
[1:50:37.240 --> 1:50:38.920]  national security act
[1:50:38.920 --> 1:50:43.400]  in nineteen forty seven this created the c i a rolled all the intelligence
[1:50:43.400 --> 1:50:45.480]  functioning under this one
[1:50:45.480 --> 1:50:48.840]  umbrella uh... separated the air force
[1:50:48.840 --> 1:50:53.400]  from the army uh... changed the name of the war department to the defense
[1:50:53.400 --> 1:50:55.720]  department stay there we got a break

[1:54:01.480 --> 1:54:14.760]  Jim Mars is our guest 15 minutes of the next hour
[1:54:14.760 --> 1:54:18.200]  then Bob Chapman joins us i gotta get Jim up here for two hours
[1:54:18.200 --> 1:54:22.520]  talk about his new book the rise of the fourth rights you can call in
[1:54:22.520 --> 1:54:26.440]  now i i want to go back because we also see them forming the new european union
[1:54:26.440 --> 1:54:29.400]  now um we see everybody converting over
[1:54:29.400 --> 1:54:32.040]  there to Catholicism because they admit european union is going to be
[1:54:32.040 --> 1:54:36.600]  basically a super state of that and i've always tried to not bash groups and
[1:54:36.600 --> 1:54:41.400]  not make it about Jews or Catholics or or Arabs because it
[1:54:41.400 --> 1:54:45.400]  only is divisive but to admit the corruption of these institutions
[1:54:45.400 --> 1:54:48.200]  is a healthy thing that doesn't mean the individuals
[1:54:48.200 --> 1:54:52.200]  and so a lot of people decried that i wouldn't say this about Zionist or that
[1:54:52.200 --> 1:54:54.760]  about Catholics uh hey if it gets us on the road to
[1:54:54.760 --> 1:54:57.400]  fight the new world order and moving on and admitting that it's in
[1:54:57.400 --> 1:55:01.080]  under control of every major group then then fine you want it you know you'll
[1:55:01.080 --> 1:55:03.800]  get it here i've had many guests over the years actually talking about
[1:55:03.800 --> 1:55:08.040]  the Vatican uh but uh we haven't done with any vitriol but if people want that
[1:55:08.040 --> 1:55:11.720]  we will do that uh i mean because there's certainly plenty of evil there
[1:55:11.720 --> 1:55:17.080]  now giving lots of a Vatican evil here let me hear just give it all to me jim
[1:55:17.080 --> 1:55:21.000]  well what you know they they argue back and forth about uh
[1:55:21.000 --> 1:55:26.600]  uh the pope past the 12th and uh and the 11th
[1:55:26.600 --> 1:55:31.000]  uh pope past the 11th came out very strongly against the nazis and then
[1:55:31.000 --> 1:55:36.040]  suddenly died um while being treated by a doctor
[1:55:36.040 --> 1:55:39.080]  who happened to be i'm sure by sheer coincidence
[1:55:39.080 --> 1:55:43.000]  the father of chloropok tachi who was the mistress to
[1:55:43.000 --> 1:55:49.960]  Benito Mussolini the dictator of italy and pope past the 12th came in and uh
[1:55:49.960 --> 1:55:55.960]  what everybody loses sight of is that uh in july of 1933 just a few
[1:55:55.960 --> 1:55:59.320]  a few months after hitler had taken power in germany
[1:55:59.320 --> 1:56:03.160]  a concordant was reached between the pope past
[1:56:03.160 --> 1:56:08.840]  and the and nazi germany uh and this is still in effect today
[1:56:08.840 --> 1:56:13.000]  and uh according to this concordant there was to be no interference by the
[1:56:13.000 --> 1:56:16.520]  church and political fairs and it also required
[1:56:16.520 --> 1:56:19.960]  all bishops to take a loyalty oath to the state
[1:56:19.960 --> 1:56:23.000]  and required all priests to be german citizens
[1:56:23.000 --> 1:56:27.400]  and subordinate to governor officials so in other words basically it was the
[1:56:27.400 --> 1:56:31.240]  state taken over the church and by the way we now see
[1:56:31.240 --> 1:56:34.840]  faith based initiative billions of dollars we told you a year before it was
[1:56:34.840 --> 1:56:38.920]  in mainstream news secretly paying creatures
[1:56:38.920 --> 1:56:43.720]  to be on homeland security payroll and to give pro-government anti-gun
[1:56:43.720 --> 1:56:48.840]  uh uh sermons to submit and then exactly so so it's all happening here
[1:56:48.840 --> 1:56:53.640]  it doesn't matter what the nomination it is happening the same thing is happening
[1:56:53.640 --> 1:56:57.800]  all over again and in fact up until the time of ronald reagan's
[1:56:57.800 --> 1:57:01.880]  administration we had declined to recognize the
[1:57:01.880 --> 1:57:08.120]  vatican as a separate national state but under the reagan administration
[1:57:08.120 --> 1:57:11.640]  and you'll find out that his uh vice president
[1:57:11.640 --> 1:57:17.240]  was george herbert walker bush and and and reagan of course was shot less than
[1:57:17.240 --> 1:57:21.640]  two months after he took office and red bush was pretty well running the show
[1:57:21.640 --> 1:57:25.800]  along with uh uh his advisors and along with dig cheney and
[1:57:25.800 --> 1:57:30.840]  donald rumsfeldt and uh and other corporate leaders
[1:57:30.840 --> 1:57:34.760]  uh and at this time reagan recognized the vatican
[1:57:34.760 --> 1:57:38.200]  as a sovereign state and they now have an embassy
[1:57:38.200 --> 1:57:41.480]  in washington dc and of course it was also reagan
[1:57:41.480 --> 1:57:48.360]  who despite uh of violent protests from veterans organizations and
[1:57:48.360 --> 1:57:52.600]  and jewish organizations nevertheless went to germany and laid a reef
[1:57:52.600 --> 1:57:57.480]  in bitberg cemetery uh where all these ss officers had been
[1:57:57.480 --> 1:58:02.920]  buried and uh everybody just thought that was absolutely uh you know outrageous
[1:58:02.920 --> 1:58:07.240]  but it also shows that how powerful the nazi influence had become
[1:58:07.240 --> 1:58:11.000]  by the 1980s and then meanwhile we're going to get when we come back into the
[1:58:11.000 --> 1:58:15.080]  bushes in their nazi pedigree uh you can't make this stuff up truth is so
[1:58:15.080 --> 1:58:18.520]  bizarre it blows away the wildest fiction

[2:01:01.720 --> 2:01:06.200]  well uh to pick up where we left off with the concordant with the catholic
[2:01:06.200 --> 2:01:12.440]  church in germany uh the uh the rumor is uh that
[2:01:12.440 --> 2:01:15.800]  basically they had reached an agreement the vatican and the
[2:01:15.800 --> 2:01:20.040]  and uh adolf hitler that uh if they when they conquered the world
[2:01:20.040 --> 2:01:25.160]  that catholicism would then be uh named as the predominant religion of the
[2:01:25.160 --> 2:01:30.280]  world uh it's this type of thing that caused our forefathers in this country
[2:01:30.280 --> 2:01:34.040]  to uh separate church from the state
[2:01:34.040 --> 2:01:37.960]  and uh unfortunately in the last couple of elections we've seen
[2:01:37.960 --> 2:01:41.560]  uh a lot of religious overtone and a lot of religious
[2:01:41.560 --> 2:01:46.760]  organizations who have gotten very active uh in the political process
[2:01:46.760 --> 2:01:51.720]  and many of those people through the most correct instincts you know uh
[2:01:51.720 --> 2:01:55.000]  the uh this is what really disturbs me is that
[2:01:55.000 --> 2:01:59.480]  especially down here in texas we do have so many true conservatives they want
[2:01:59.480 --> 2:02:02.760]  to conserve the constitution united states and the
[2:02:02.760 --> 2:02:05.800]  bill of rights they want to conserve family values they want to
[2:02:05.800 --> 2:02:09.880]  they want border security uh they want less government
[2:02:09.880 --> 2:02:13.560]  uh and they have the right instincts the problem is they've been led by the
[2:02:13.560 --> 2:02:18.520]  nose by these neocons uh or national
[2:02:18.520 --> 2:02:22.920]  socialists who adhere to illuminati philosophy which is
[2:02:22.920 --> 2:02:26.520]  the end justifies the means which means they will do
[2:02:26.520 --> 2:02:30.280]  anything to accomplish their purposes they will lie chief
[2:02:30.280 --> 2:02:33.880]  still pretend to be anybody or anything
[2:02:33.880 --> 2:02:38.280]  even kill this is uh this was at the heart of the nazi philosophy
[2:02:38.280 --> 2:02:41.480]  and they've now brought it to this country and uh
[2:02:41.480 --> 2:02:45.640]  i think you and many other people are doing a an excellent job of trying to
[2:02:45.640 --> 2:02:49.960]  rouse the interest and the uh focus of the public
[2:02:49.960 --> 2:02:53.880]  because there are more of us than there are of them
[2:02:53.880 --> 2:02:57.560]  but they've got us divided and distracted
[2:02:57.560 --> 2:03:04.280]  and uh we must unite and act as truly free american citizens of all color
[2:03:04.280 --> 2:03:08.040]  striped religions and what we have to do is find our common ground
[2:03:08.040 --> 2:03:11.640]  and i think the common ground would be individual liberty
[2:03:11.640 --> 2:03:15.400]  wouldn't you agree absolutely jim continue
[2:03:15.400 --> 2:03:20.200]  um well and the thing is uh that presents the biggest problem
[2:03:20.200 --> 2:03:26.440]  to this new world order uh the fact that in america we have a tradition
[2:03:26.440 --> 2:03:30.840]  of individual freedom and liberty and second we have a
[2:03:30.840 --> 2:03:34.920]  a legal foundation for such individual liberty and freedom namely the
[2:03:34.920 --> 2:03:38.680]  constitution the bill of rights and by the way
[2:03:38.680 --> 2:03:41.800]  any problem we're having in this country today is not
[2:03:41.800 --> 2:03:46.040]  because of the constitution of the bill of rights it's because we are not
[2:03:46.040 --> 2:03:49.160]  following the constitution for the bill of rights
[2:03:49.160 --> 2:03:52.920]  and then finally the biggest obstacle is because we not only have
[2:03:52.920 --> 2:03:56.760]  a tradition of freedom we also have a legal foundation
[2:03:56.760 --> 2:04:03.560]  we also have guns and so they have had to work very hard to disrupt and
[2:04:03.560 --> 2:04:07.800]  destroy the sovereignty and the cohesiveness
[2:04:07.800 --> 2:04:12.120]  of the united states of america but they have been quite successful because
[2:04:12.120 --> 2:04:14.760]  first they gained control over the mass media
[2:04:14.760 --> 2:04:18.760]  there are now five corporations that control everything you see in here
[2:04:18.760 --> 2:04:22.200]  and i'm not just talking about news i'm talking about billboards
[2:04:22.200 --> 2:04:25.880]  and cds and music and films and movies
[2:04:25.880 --> 2:04:30.840]  and cable and satellite they're all controlled by one of five corporations
[2:04:30.840 --> 2:04:34.760]  one of which by the way is burtelsman of uh...
[2:04:34.760 --> 2:04:38.920]  germany this was a company that is still privately owned
[2:04:38.920 --> 2:04:43.960]  and during the war it was the largest publisher of nazi propaganda
[2:04:43.960 --> 2:04:47.880]  for the german army and today it controls all but

[2:08:54.920 --> 2:09:00.120]  info wars dot com right now uh now uh let's uh go back to jim
[2:09:00.120 --> 2:09:03.960]  mars with his book put up by a major publisher
[2:09:03.960 --> 2:09:06.920]  jim before you finish up that was quite a victory
[2:09:06.920 --> 2:09:13.080]  to get a major publisher to put this out well yeah that's true and uh there
[2:09:13.080 --> 2:09:18.520]  were some uh tense moments during the editing process and i'm not sure
[2:09:18.520 --> 2:09:21.880]  exactly how all that got overcome other than uh
[2:09:21.880 --> 2:09:25.800]  that what that's one of the keys to this corporate control you know the
[2:09:25.800 --> 2:09:30.600]  definition of fascism is the blending of state and corporate power
[2:09:30.600 --> 2:09:35.400]  and uh the the only difference we have today is that in germ pre-war germany
[2:09:35.400 --> 2:09:38.920]  the state gained control over the corporations and in modern america
[2:09:38.920 --> 2:09:42.360]  today the corporations have gained control over the state
[2:09:42.360 --> 2:09:46.520]  but the end result the same it's this fusion of state corporate power
[2:09:46.520 --> 2:09:50.680]  which is the very definition of fascism um and
[2:09:50.680 --> 2:09:54.760]  here's what's interesting uh alex i know that everybody
[2:09:54.760 --> 2:09:58.360]  almost everybody today republican democrat liberal conservative
[2:09:58.360 --> 2:10:01.720]  everybody realizes that we're in trouble in this country and that we've taken
[2:10:01.720 --> 2:10:06.040]  the wrong term somehow and yet uh nobody seems to know what to do about it
[2:10:06.040 --> 2:10:09.320]  because they're as you well know they're all fighting with each other and
[2:10:09.320 --> 2:10:12.760]  point their fingers at each other in the liberals brain the conservatives and
[2:10:12.760 --> 2:10:16.360]  conservatives blame the liberals and the democrats and the republicans and the
[2:10:16.360 --> 2:10:20.040]  and the gays and the heterosexuals and the catholics and the protestants and
[2:10:20.040 --> 2:10:23.240]  the jews and the they just keep everybody fighting with each other
[2:10:23.240 --> 2:10:27.880]  and uh i think that what i would hope with my new book the rise of the fourth
[2:10:27.880 --> 2:10:32.440]  right is that we can all turn and point the finger at the international
[2:10:32.440 --> 2:10:37.160]  globalist who first financed communism and then financed hitler and the
[2:10:37.160 --> 2:10:40.760]  nazis and are now building a fourth empire or
[2:10:40.760 --> 2:10:44.600]  right in the united states and they've written a bunch of textbooks
[2:10:44.600 --> 2:10:47.880]  admitting this the millner group uh the head of the georgetown
[2:10:47.880 --> 2:10:52.600]  of political science carol quickly i mean we know what's going on that's why
[2:10:52.600 --> 2:10:56.120]  there's so much confusion because people can't think at that level for some
[2:10:56.120 --> 2:10:59.240]  reason they've got to obsess they can see the new world order
[2:10:59.240 --> 2:11:02.600]  and and they think if you say it's multiple groups you're giving comfort to
[2:11:02.600 --> 2:11:06.680]  one of the groups no it's like a five guys rob a bank we're saying all five
[2:11:06.680 --> 2:11:12.360]  are equally co guilty in this and every major group
[2:11:12.360 --> 2:11:16.520]  israel germany the chai the communists that you know the communist chinese
[2:11:16.520 --> 2:11:20.680]  it's all new world order and they meet in these global crime syndicate meetings
[2:11:20.680 --> 2:11:23.560]  we've stolen their minutes we've snuck in their meetings
[2:11:23.560 --> 2:11:27.400]  and we've got to come together against global centralized power
[2:11:27.400 --> 2:11:30.760]  that cuts off the driveshaft of their system go ahead
[2:11:30.760 --> 2:11:35.800]  absolutely and we need to to call them by their proper name they and it's
[2:11:35.800 --> 2:11:40.120]  interesting because they are the one group that it's still
[2:11:40.120 --> 2:11:44.280]  politically correct and socially acceptable to vilify
[2:11:44.280 --> 2:11:48.200]  they are nazis they are national socialist
[2:11:48.200 --> 2:11:53.400]  and we need to identify them as such and band together and point the finger at
[2:11:53.400 --> 2:11:56.840]  the true culprits the the five bank robbers
[2:11:56.840 --> 2:12:01.320]  who are national socialist they're nazis the nazis are robbing the bank
[2:12:01.320 --> 2:12:05.080]  and we need to make people aware of that wouldn't you agree alec absolutely and
[2:12:05.080 --> 2:12:08.040]  and see they created communism because they needed a
[2:12:08.040 --> 2:12:11.400]  evil system to chew up countries grab things fool the serfs
[2:12:11.400 --> 2:12:16.120]  to rebel against the old imperiums so the british could take those over
[2:12:16.120 --> 2:12:20.520]  but it doesn't work as well as fascism because fascism uses free market it
[2:12:20.520 --> 2:12:24.040]  says every child you kidnap through color of law
[2:12:24.040 --> 2:12:27.560]  cps worker you get two grand bonus personally
[2:12:27.560 --> 2:12:30.040]  well they want to make a hundred grand a year most of them do they go out and
[2:12:30.040 --> 2:12:32.840]  steal kids or you know cops you want to share an
[2:12:32.840 --> 2:12:35.480]  asset forfeiture seizure for violating the constitution
[2:12:35.480 --> 2:12:39.320]  taking goods without any proof or any due process you get money
[2:12:39.320 --> 2:12:43.400]  uh oh you want to be mercenaries getting 180 grand a year to kill innocent people
[2:12:43.400 --> 2:12:46.440]  and commit crimes and do all of this and run death squads
[2:12:46.440 --> 2:12:50.520]  instead of 20 grand a year is as some grunt uh okay we'll do it
[2:12:50.520 --> 2:12:55.240]  and so that that is the fascist system it is a piratical booty
[2:12:55.240 --> 2:13:01.800]  sharing loot sharing system absolutely and that is the very system that they
[2:13:01.800 --> 2:13:05.000]  are trying to impose on the united states of america and
[2:13:05.000 --> 2:13:08.280]  if the american people don't wake up pretty soon
[2:13:08.280 --> 2:13:12.520]  and throw off the yoke of political party partisanship
[2:13:12.520 --> 2:13:17.640]  and start standing up for true freedom and uh and uh
[2:13:17.640 --> 2:13:22.680]  liberty then you know we're gonna all end up in the camps
[2:13:22.680 --> 2:13:26.120]  exactly our movement and it's it's turned in on itself and so much come and
[2:13:26.120 --> 2:13:28.920]  tell pro while it's blasting forward expanding
[2:13:28.920 --> 2:13:32.760]  there's these pockets of festering infighting folks it has to stop i mean
[2:13:32.760 --> 2:13:35.720]  we know they're taking our liberties attacking our bill of rights
[2:13:35.720 --> 2:13:39.080]  we know we can stand for that we can stand against wars against
[2:13:39.080 --> 2:13:44.040]  innocent nations we all have to agree on that now and wake up as many people as
[2:13:44.040 --> 2:13:47.640]  you can instead of standing around pontificating about
[2:13:47.640 --> 2:13:50.840]  you know who's got it honed down the best i'm telling you i just cover the pure
[2:13:50.840 --> 2:13:55.160]  research i go where the facts lead me and what jim marz is saying is
[2:13:55.160 --> 2:13:58.600]  the absolute truth it is what the evidence shows it is
[2:13:58.600 --> 2:14:02.120]  history and you try to explain to people the zionists work for the nazis and the
[2:14:02.120 --> 2:14:05.160]  nazis work for the british and i mean you try to explain that they work for

[2:15:14.920 --> 2:15:17.160]  only got the first third of it i want to get into what's happening
[2:15:17.160 --> 2:15:22.040]  in the modern times the bush is all of it okay jim right we need to get into the
[2:15:22.040 --> 2:15:25.400]  drugging of america the uh dissolution of our
[2:15:25.400 --> 2:15:28.440]  education system family the nazis did it all
[2:15:28.440 --> 2:15:32.920]  oh yeah and they're following the same game plan is what's so incredible
[2:15:32.920 --> 2:15:36.040]  they're not even altering their tactics they're doing the same thing they did
[2:15:36.040 --> 2:15:39.800]  in germany and and it's working over here in in my study of
[2:15:39.800 --> 2:15:43.160]  of hitler in the third right my biggest question was how could those germans
[2:15:43.160 --> 2:15:47.240]  who in the 1930s were among the most educated and cultured people in the
[2:15:47.240 --> 2:15:51.000]  world how could they allow themselves to get sucked into hitler and
[2:15:51.000 --> 2:15:55.320]  the holocaust and everything else that happened and now i understand it
[2:15:55.320 --> 2:15:59.960]  because it's happening here exactly and again germany with the phd the
[2:15:59.960 --> 2:16:03.400]  british for the social working system the u.s. they all shared info
[2:16:03.400 --> 2:16:08.920]  it is an amalgamation and uh and look at our choice today we're in an election
[2:16:08.920 --> 2:16:13.720]  year and you can vote for obama barack obama who is backed by zygmanu
[2:16:13.720 --> 2:16:17.240]  brzezinski and his son and the trilateral commission or you can vote for
[2:16:17.240 --> 2:16:21.000]  mccain who's backed by henry kissinger and the council on foreign relations
[2:16:21.000 --> 2:16:24.680]  and the council on foreign relations of course was the progenitor of the
[2:16:24.680 --> 2:16:29.000]  trilateral commission so you get to choose between tweedle d or tweedle
[2:16:29.000 --> 2:16:32.040]  dum and they're both controlled by the same folks
[2:16:32.040 --> 2:16:36.280]  yeah you get to shoot yourself with uh two different brands of 45 holla point
[2:16:36.280 --> 2:16:38.920]  thank you so much jim we'll talk to you next week

[2:16:45.480 --> 2:16:49.400]  bottom of the hour ron paul came on and during the middle of jim's
[2:16:49.400 --> 2:16:52.600]  interview so things got a bit of skew bob chapman the international
[2:16:52.600 --> 2:16:55.560]  forecaster dot com at one time the biggest golden silver broker in the
[2:16:55.560 --> 2:16:57.640]  world had the biggest newsletter in the world

[2:17:09.320 --> 2:17:12.600]  patriot movement that is the progenitor of so much of what we're witnessing
[2:17:12.600 --> 2:17:14.840]  today i want to get into economics in four minutes
[2:17:14.840 --> 2:17:18.520]  when we come back from break but you've been on hold for about six or seven
[2:17:18.520 --> 2:17:22.840]  listening to jim marz you worked in intelligence in europe

[2:17:27.560 --> 2:17:30.920]  what is your take on what you heard us talking about
[2:17:30.920 --> 2:17:35.160]  i think it's absolutely correct i felt like a vocal voice in the wilderness
[2:17:35.160 --> 2:17:38.760]  eight years ago when i started to describe the
[2:17:38.760 --> 2:17:41.960]  direction which the illuminati was headed
[2:17:41.960 --> 2:17:47.640]  which was deeply into fascism and uh... i'm so glad to see others uh...
[2:17:47.640 --> 2:17:51.800]  have picked it up along the way as well uh... we need all the voices
[2:17:51.800 --> 2:17:56.680]  we can to tell the people the truth and that's exactly what it is
[2:17:56.680 --> 2:17:59.640]  absolutely uh... what do you want to cover when we get back from break so much
[2:17:59.640 --> 2:18:02.600]  has happened since uh... you were on on monday
[2:18:02.600 --> 2:18:06.120]  um... uh... the market's getting taken apart today
[2:18:06.120 --> 2:18:10.200]  i i've got some commentary i can make on gold and silver why it's acting the way
[2:18:10.200 --> 2:18:15.160]  it is and we just wherever it leads us you know
[2:18:15.160 --> 2:18:19.240]  we'll be taking calls on the economy with the bob Chapman at one eight hundred
[2:18:19.240 --> 2:18:22.040]  two five at nine ninety two thirty one it is
[2:18:22.040 --> 2:18:25.320]  a live radio show the twenty-fourth of july two thousand and eight
[2:18:25.320 --> 2:18:28.040]  uh... on this thursday edition one eight hundred
[2:18:28.040 --> 2:18:31.400]  two five at nine ninety two thirty one we got about a minute and a half to
[2:18:31.400 --> 2:18:34.520]  towards break but bob go ahead and get started
[2:18:34.520 --> 2:18:37.640]  well first of all uh... we thought today
[2:18:37.640 --> 2:18:42.200]  a uh... continued uh... attack on gold and silver
[2:18:42.200 --> 2:18:48.040]  and i cover uh... what transpired in the saddest issue which you all can get a
[2:18:48.040 --> 2:18:50.360]  free copy of if you're not subscribers
[2:18:50.360 --> 2:18:54.840]  under the gold section and what happens is that
[2:18:54.840 --> 2:18:58.520]  happens frequently is that the commercials
[2:18:58.520 --> 2:19:04.600]  in the gold and silver market they sell calls to people
[2:19:04.600 --> 2:19:09.640]  and there's a call to purchase gold or silver at a
[2:19:09.640 --> 2:19:15.320]  future price up until a certain date and that certain date this month is this
[2:19:15.320 --> 2:19:20.040]  next monday and so gold was deeply
[2:19:20.040 --> 2:19:24.840]  and silver to uh... some extent into the money on these calls
[2:19:24.840 --> 2:19:30.680]  and so the commercials and of course the CFTC is looking right at them
[2:19:30.680 --> 2:19:36.920]  and they're pounding the price down so they don't have to pay these people
[2:19:36.920 --> 2:19:40.120]  bob stay there and let's put it in layman terms because of
[2:19:40.120 --> 2:19:43.480]  i can follow you but i've been studying this for a while uh... other folks may
[2:19:43.480 --> 2:19:46.120]  not be able to follow you so in layman terms when we get back
[2:19:46.120 --> 2:19:49.560]  what's happening and why this is so important they they try this all the
[2:19:49.560 --> 2:19:52.520]  time it's not going to work

[2:24:00.840 --> 2:24:18.120]  okay bob what is going on with the rigging of these markets that by
[2:24:18.120 --> 2:24:24.040]  their very design are insider trading cash machines for the elite and of
[2:24:24.040 --> 2:24:28.280]  course the public pays as the suckers
[2:24:28.280 --> 2:24:34.520]  well as i was discussing we have a group of people who are call
[2:24:34.520 --> 2:24:40.440]  commercials who are traders in on the comics and both gold and silver
[2:24:40.440 --> 2:24:44.680]  and they sell to the public
[2:24:44.680 --> 2:24:51.400]  calls and like you can buy a call to purchase gold at $920 and you pay a
[2:24:51.400 --> 2:24:55.560]  fee for that and uh when the term is up
[2:24:55.560 --> 2:24:59.560]  usually a month and a half or two months hence
[2:24:59.560 --> 2:25:06.120]  then if the price of the gold is 950 you've made some money for yourself
[2:25:06.120 --> 2:25:10.120]  and when we see and this is very prevalent
[2:25:10.120 --> 2:25:13.960]  in august which is at the end of the july month
[2:25:13.960 --> 2:25:18.120]  and also in december these are the big months historically
[2:25:18.120 --> 2:25:23.000]  and when you when you see a great many contracts
[2:25:23.000 --> 2:25:26.440]  or options that have been sold to people
[2:25:26.440 --> 2:25:31.240]  are what they call in the money in other words you're they're profitable
[2:25:31.240 --> 2:25:38.040]  what happens is like clockwork with the CFTC the Commodity Futures Traders
[2:25:38.040 --> 2:25:44.280]  Trading Corporation standing by watching them do this market rigging
[2:25:44.280 --> 2:25:49.880]  they drive the price down like they just did from 980 to 920 dollars an ounce
[2:25:49.880 --> 2:25:54.760]  and wipe out the profits of all of those people who have those call options
[2:25:54.760 --> 2:25:58.600]  and that's one of the reasons why we saw this
[2:25:58.600 --> 2:26:03.720]  recent correction and those contracts terminate on monday
[2:26:03.720 --> 2:26:06.840]  so there's only two trading days left after today
[2:26:06.840 --> 2:26:10.200]  and then the pressure will relieve and gold will turn around and along with
[2:26:10.200 --> 2:26:14.840]  silver and go right back up again and uh sometimes the
[2:26:14.840 --> 2:26:19.080]  united states government is behind that doing it and sometimes they're not
[2:26:19.080 --> 2:26:24.280]  and uh more often than not they are uh we can't prove that because when we
[2:26:24.280 --> 2:26:26.520]  question government they won't tell us that
[2:26:26.520 --> 2:26:29.640]  because uh we don't have a need to know and it's a secret
[2:26:29.640 --> 2:26:32.840]  what is the mechanism and they'll occasionally lop the head off of some
[2:26:32.840 --> 2:26:36.040]  mid-level person or some low-level person like martha steward involved in
[2:26:36.040 --> 2:26:39.800]  nothing while the main crimes go on that you know to throw somebody to the
[2:26:39.800 --> 2:26:44.280]  wolves uh the the naked shorting uh what is the
[2:26:44.280 --> 2:26:47.480]  predatory mechanism and we know they don't just do things to keep
[2:26:47.480 --> 2:26:53.000]  keep new money or new new elites down and and and and smaller you know faster
[2:26:53.000 --> 2:26:57.640]  moving more aggressive companies down uh what is the mechanism profit wise
[2:26:57.640 --> 2:27:03.320]  for the naked shorting of uh companies that are that are smaller
[2:27:03.320 --> 2:27:07.800]  well the shorting in order to short you bet a stock is going to go down and
[2:27:07.800 --> 2:27:11.560]  let's take and let's say it's ibm and ibm's a hundred
[2:27:11.560 --> 2:27:16.840]  and you want to bet on a hundred shares
[2:27:16.840 --> 2:27:20.040]  on the short side of the market that ibm's going to go down
[2:27:20.040 --> 2:27:23.800]  but in order to do that the brokerage firm that you're with
[2:27:23.800 --> 2:27:30.680]  must be able to borrow that stock and you you pay a fee to borrow that stock
[2:27:30.680 --> 2:27:34.840]  from somebody else that's the way the system works
[2:27:34.840 --> 2:27:38.520]  and if you don't do that you've got a naked short
[2:27:38.520 --> 2:27:42.200]  now there's two profit centers here basically
[2:27:42.200 --> 2:27:47.800]  the first one is the bank the brokerage firm the investment bank
[2:27:47.800 --> 2:27:55.400]  who lends the stock gets paid for it the the client who stock that they borrow
[2:27:55.400 --> 2:27:59.960]  doesn't get paid for it they call it a hypothecation agreement
[2:27:59.960 --> 2:28:05.880]  and so what the banks the brokerage firms etc have been doing
[2:28:05.880 --> 2:28:09.880]  is let's say a thousand people came to them
[2:28:09.880 --> 2:28:13.640]  and wanted to borrow a hundred shares of ibm stock
[2:28:13.640 --> 2:28:17.720]  and let's say they only had a hundred what they were doing and are doing
[2:28:17.720 --> 2:28:23.400]  today is lending a thousand people that hundred shares of stock
[2:28:23.400 --> 2:28:27.160]  and they're getting paid for it that fee
[2:28:27.160 --> 2:28:31.560]  and at the same time they're allowing all these people to go naked short
[2:28:31.560 --> 2:28:35.000]  and some of them are aware that they're naked short and some
[2:28:35.000 --> 2:28:40.760]  are the second phase of that is in trading departments i
[2:28:40.760 --> 2:28:45.080]  belong to the la traders for 25 years
[2:28:45.080 --> 2:28:48.920]  and i was a professional trader as well as a stock broker
[2:28:48.920 --> 2:28:54.520]  and in doing transactions in particular stocks
[2:28:54.520 --> 2:28:57.640]  if you initiate a short you're supposed to have that
[2:28:57.640 --> 2:29:00.840]  stock available in house or from somebody else
[2:29:00.840 --> 2:29:05.880]  to be able to borrow if as a trader you're shorting well these traders don't
[2:29:05.880 --> 2:29:10.360]  want to bother to find out because they're going 50 miles an hour
[2:29:10.360 --> 2:29:14.120]  whether they get the stock in house or not they just do the trade
[2:29:14.120 --> 2:29:19.720]  and so very very often they know that they're naked short but they don't care
[2:29:19.720 --> 2:29:24.120]  because nobody ever calls it on and so that's another profit center
[2:29:24.120 --> 2:29:31.560]  the most important part of naked shorting to me is the ability
[2:29:31.560 --> 2:29:35.880]  of large companies at the past of the united states government
[2:29:35.880 --> 2:29:40.760]  to drive down the prices of specific stocks stay there bob Chapman more on

[2:33:11.320 --> 2:33:14.760]  john chris matt mark scott and others your calls
[2:33:14.760 --> 2:33:21.640]  are coming up in five minutes continuing um
[2:33:21.640 --> 2:33:24.200]  bob Chapman with what you were breaking down there with a naked shorting and
[2:33:24.200 --> 2:33:27.400]  what's happening and why they do it to drive down certain key stocks at
[2:33:27.400 --> 2:33:30.840]  certain times and then other important things are happening in the market and
[2:33:30.840 --> 2:33:35.560]  then i want to go to some calls sir okay and so they do target specific
[2:33:35.560 --> 2:33:39.880]  stocks like the gold and silver shares but more than that
[2:33:39.880 --> 2:33:44.040]  they target small companies and the reason why is they want them out of
[2:33:44.040 --> 2:33:46.600]  business and the reason they want them out of
[2:33:46.600 --> 2:33:49.800]  business is that they want all the money to flow
[2:33:49.800 --> 2:33:53.800]  to the new york stock exchange stocks of the big capitalization stocks
[2:33:53.800 --> 2:33:58.200]  and i don't want anything in between and that's why the sdc chase is down
[2:33:58.200 --> 2:34:03.960]  mid-time mid-tier and lower smaller brokerage firms and harasses the heck
[2:34:03.960 --> 2:34:07.320]  out of them yeah the big firms could be cutting women's heads off on national
[2:34:07.320 --> 2:34:12.280]  tv uh you know uh having sex with goats i mean you know
[2:34:12.280 --> 2:34:16.040]  whatever just the wildest stuff and for everyone that's okay
[2:34:16.040 --> 2:34:19.560]  but of a mid-sized firm as a crooked toenail they're going to have swat
[2:34:19.560 --> 2:34:23.000]  teams coming on that's right and in a little brokerage
[2:34:23.000 --> 2:34:27.960]  uh you know uh they just absolutely drive them all out of business
[2:34:27.960 --> 2:34:31.880]  i mean i've seen instances where they've taken the list of customers of a
[2:34:31.880 --> 2:34:35.640]  broker and the sdc and the nesd have called them
[2:34:35.640 --> 2:34:40.040]  trying to get the clients to bring some sort of charge against the broker
[2:34:40.040 --> 2:34:45.320]  it is unspeakable what they do and so that's all part of that syndrome so
[2:34:45.320 --> 2:34:49.240]  naked shorting is used to make a lot of money
[2:34:49.240 --> 2:34:58.120]  and drive down the price of the stock sometimes to zero
[2:34:58.120 --> 2:35:02.600]  now bob uh there's so much going on what is most important for listeners to be
[2:35:02.600 --> 2:35:06.440]  aware of what's happening economically right now like what's going on with
[2:35:06.440 --> 2:35:09.320]  the way the oil going down about 25 dollars a barrel
[2:35:09.320 --> 2:35:12.040]  well oil went down for two reasons number one
[2:35:12.040 --> 2:35:16.120]  there was a massive margin uh excuse me a margin call
[2:35:16.120 --> 2:35:19.800]  and there was a very large firm which just went bank bankrupt
[2:35:19.800 --> 2:35:24.760]  and they were long oil and they got caught they had to cover their shorts
[2:35:24.760 --> 2:35:31.640]  and uh that drove the the the price up you know to 147 dollars a barrel
[2:35:31.640 --> 2:35:35.720]  uh when that happened uh producers stepped in
[2:35:35.720 --> 2:35:40.360]  and started selling oil forward mexico was one of the big sellers
[2:35:40.360 --> 2:35:44.360]  and they drove oil back down again they they thought that was a good price to
[2:35:44.360 --> 2:35:48.360]  sell their oil out and and that's natural anyway
[2:35:48.360 --> 2:35:53.000]  uh i think oil uh it has support level 120 125
[2:35:53.000 --> 2:35:57.240]  i think we've seen again a short term intermediate
[2:35:57.240 --> 2:36:00.440]  term bottom on gold and silver it's a buy-in here
[2:36:00.440 --> 2:36:04.040]  at these levels uh if they they banged it and banged it and banged it today they
[2:36:04.040 --> 2:36:07.720]  came right back again and so i i like the positions
[2:36:07.720 --> 2:36:11.320]  incidentally uh there's a reverse head and shoulders
[2:36:11.320 --> 2:36:15.160]  on gold and uh it's about ready to fly
[2:36:15.160 --> 2:36:20.440]  and so folks that don't understand uh they believe it was the summer peak as
[2:36:20.440 --> 2:36:24.280]  they do in the cycle people are going to think now that four dollars a gallon is
[2:36:24.280 --> 2:36:28.440]  great in the next summer it'll be five six dollars a gallon and then we'll
[2:36:28.440 --> 2:36:32.920]  then go back in the winter back down to 450 and people think it's low
[2:36:32.920 --> 2:36:36.840]  that's the cycle look at the seven-year graph on oil and so you're saying they
[2:36:36.840 --> 2:36:39.880]  dumped a whole bunch of oil mexico and others on the market
[2:36:39.880 --> 2:36:43.400]  at its peak that created a glut for a for a time
[2:36:43.400 --> 2:36:50.920]  and then now we will see uh oil prices not peak again above uh 147 150 until
[2:36:50.920 --> 2:36:53.080]  next summer or do you think because of dollar
[2:36:53.080 --> 2:36:57.800]  implosion we're going to see that earlier um
[2:36:57.800 --> 2:37:01.800]  it's hard to say um but i don't see it going down much either
[2:37:01.800 --> 2:37:06.600]  an absolute bottom would be 80 dollars uh more likely it'll trade between one
[2:37:06.600 --> 2:37:11.880]  and 150 uh and that's of course if there's no wars going on that a new wars
[2:37:11.880 --> 2:37:15.720]  so what happens uh different analysts say different things some
[2:37:15.720 --> 2:37:19.800]  opax says unlimited others say eight dollars a gallon's conservative
[2:37:19.800 --> 2:37:23.080]  what are we going to be paying if they blow the hell out of that place
[2:37:23.080 --> 2:37:28.440]  well i would think uh oil would probably go to 300 dollars
[2:37:28.440 --> 2:37:32.600]  and uh what that translates into gasoline i don't know but nine dollars i don't
[2:37:32.600 --> 2:37:36.440]  think i i don't think it would stay there for a long time alex
[2:37:36.440 --> 2:37:41.880]  i think it would be a temporary thing just like it was back in the 70s
[2:37:41.880 --> 2:37:45.880]  uh you know that didn't last very long and it was of a different nature
[2:37:45.880 --> 2:37:50.520]  how bad would a three or four month run of eight nine dollars a gallon uh
[2:37:50.520 --> 2:37:54.840]  what would that do to the economy well it certainly would affect gdp would
[2:37:54.840 --> 2:37:57.800]  probably take it down above one half or one percent
[2:37:57.800 --> 2:38:02.120]  and it's already two and a half percent minus irrespective of the phony numbers
[2:38:02.120 --> 2:38:07.320]  our government puts out and uh the you know they are even calling for growth
[2:38:07.320 --> 2:38:12.760]  uh for the third quarter of uh 0.05 percent which is a half or percent
[2:38:12.760 --> 2:38:17.720]  and that's just not so uh i'm looking for a minus three
[2:38:17.720 --> 2:38:21.080]  but you'll never see that because the government fudges their figures that's
[2:38:21.080 --> 2:38:24.040]  right the economy is in massive contraction and they're running around
[2:38:24.040 --> 2:38:27.160]  saying it's milk and honey in the streets and if it's a conspiracy theory of
[2:38:27.160 --> 2:38:30.520]  you don't love it that's correct and you know
[2:38:30.520 --> 2:38:34.200]  they just ran the on the stock market out 900 points
[2:38:34.200 --> 2:38:38.040]  and uh mostly behind that with the big brokerage firms
[2:38:38.040 --> 2:38:43.800]  uh on instructions from treasury and the fed and of course both of them were in
[2:38:43.800 --> 2:38:48.920]  manipulating the market at the same time and yesterday the market started to run
[2:38:48.920 --> 2:38:52.440]  out of gas on the upside and today it's down over 200
[2:38:52.440 --> 2:38:55.560]  points why is october and november the time that we
[2:38:55.560 --> 2:38:58.440]  normally see massive stock reductions and what do you think we're going to see
[2:38:58.440 --> 2:39:03.160]  this this fall um why is it not i think it's historical
[2:39:03.160 --> 2:39:07.640]  more than anything else but i think people are starting to realize a report
[2:39:07.640 --> 2:39:11.640]  came up today from the head analyst meryl inch said that uh
[2:39:11.640 --> 2:39:14.920]  earnings were not going to be nearly as good as people thought they were going
[2:39:14.920 --> 2:39:20.040]  to be and he expected the market to sell often and that's a logical conclusion
[2:39:20.040 --> 2:39:23.320]  but uh i think the market's going to get hit again
[2:39:23.320 --> 2:39:26.600]  in october irrespective of the relay of the election
[2:39:26.600 --> 2:39:30.440]  because the people behind the throne so to speak don't care who's elected to
[2:39:30.440 --> 2:39:34.680]  control them both 37 drop in projected profits for american
[2:39:34.680 --> 2:39:39.000]  express one of the supposedly safer uh more conservative uh
[2:39:39.000 --> 2:39:42.600]  credit card lending groups we have all these other economic
[2:39:42.600 --> 2:39:47.080]  numbers of factory shutdowns businesses contracting uh the inflation
[2:39:47.080 --> 2:39:50.120]  they're not being able to keep that under wraps it's old folks are now on
[2:39:50.120 --> 2:39:54.120]  fixed incomes getting really upset can you talk about that and tie it into the
[2:39:54.120 --> 2:39:57.400]  bank runs we're seeing and give us a six month
[2:39:57.400 --> 2:40:01.160]  forecast on what we're going to see them we're going to call us
[2:40:01.160 --> 2:40:04.440]  well i think we can go sideways to lower in the market
[2:40:04.440 --> 2:40:08.600]  i think gold and silver will go higher inflation will officially go higher
[2:40:08.600 --> 2:40:12.200]  it's now 13 and a quarter percent by my numbers
[2:40:12.200 --> 2:40:17.160]  uh we're going to see more high jinks um did you did you have run call on today
[2:40:17.160 --> 2:40:20.520]  did you say yes i did they're having an emergency meeting about all the oil
[2:40:20.520 --> 2:40:24.040]  manipulation today yeah i saw part of that
[2:40:24.040 --> 2:40:29.480]  and uh one of the things that ron brought out was in this uh
[2:40:29.480 --> 2:40:33.320]  uh uh legislation that they're passing
[2:40:33.320 --> 2:40:39.800]  to bail out the banks and fanny may uh what they tucked into that thing uh
[2:40:39.800 --> 2:40:44.440]  was that if you're using credit cards
[2:40:44.440 --> 2:40:48.360]  the irs wants a copy of all your transactions
[2:40:48.360 --> 2:40:52.200]  and what they're trying to do there is back into
[2:40:52.200 --> 2:40:56.840]  and that asset audit you by using those statements
[2:40:56.840 --> 2:41:00.440]  that's what they're up to well it's an automatic reporting system
[2:41:00.440 --> 2:41:05.640]  it's an automatic reporting system exactly and and what you want to do
[2:41:05.640 --> 2:41:10.280]  is stop using your credit cards only use them when you must
[2:41:10.280 --> 2:41:14.680]  do business and cash and it'll shut off the irs at the past
[2:41:14.680 --> 2:41:18.520]  well here's another horrible piece of news abc news is reporting
[2:41:18.520 --> 2:41:21.800]  that big gas station chains because they're insurance companies others tell
[2:41:21.800 --> 2:41:24.840]  them do it they do it that's how this corporate fascism works
[2:41:24.840 --> 2:41:28.840]  are saying you're gonna have to register everywhere to buy gas and use a credit
[2:41:28.840 --> 2:41:32.120]  card they're saying they're not going to be accepting cash
[2:41:32.120 --> 2:41:35.480]  so i mean they're really happy this morning i mean they're really they're
[2:41:35.480 --> 2:41:39.640]  not playing around i mean this is it
[2:41:39.640 --> 2:41:44.040]  well we know what to do and that is to inform everybody of what they're doing
[2:41:44.040 --> 2:41:47.320]  so the people rise up and uh it will happen
[2:41:47.320 --> 2:41:51.560]  we're on the right track we got them on the run they know they've missed again
[2:41:51.560 --> 2:41:55.320]  on this this time we're not going to get a let let them get away
[2:41:55.320 --> 2:41:58.920]  well here's the deal they know going into a huge recession already in it and in
[2:41:58.920 --> 2:42:02.280]  depression guaranteed the next three years
[2:42:02.280 --> 2:42:05.880]  they're had the more cops more tickets more taxes more regulations
[2:42:05.880 --> 2:42:10.120]  they know we can't pay it and then now tracking all of our purchases
[2:42:10.120 --> 2:42:13.800]  instant uploads tracking everything you do not just to tax you but to have your
[2:42:13.800 --> 2:42:16.600]  behavioral records in there learning about different relationships
[2:42:16.600 --> 2:42:19.800]  destroying black markets which are what only thing that keeps us alive
[2:42:19.800 --> 2:42:24.280]  whether it's mowing yards or garage sales a new environmental taxes i mean
[2:42:24.280 --> 2:42:27.720]  they aren't going to stop bob what do you think's behind this
[2:42:27.720 --> 2:42:32.120]  just squeezing and going just destroying us
[2:42:32.120 --> 2:42:36.520]  it's a control of all of our assets knowing where everything is
[2:42:36.520 --> 2:42:39.640]  that's what they've been doing for the last eight years even among
[2:42:39.640 --> 2:42:45.320]  multi-millionaires who some of home have been hiding their assets offshore
[2:42:45.320 --> 2:42:48.600]  and they want to corral all that money so they can control it
[2:42:48.600 --> 2:42:53.800]  and i expect that if this leverman bill is passed which
[2:42:53.800 --> 2:42:58.760]  would limit any entity particularly pension funds
[2:42:58.760 --> 2:43:06.120]  from buying more agricultural or energy commodities than government thought
[2:43:06.120 --> 2:43:09.320]  was necessary i think that that bill will
[2:43:09.320 --> 2:43:13.960]  eventually lead to currency controls and that means you won't be able to move
[2:43:13.960 --> 2:43:18.600]  your money out of the country or be in the foreign exchange market
[2:43:18.600 --> 2:43:22.200]  unless the government allows you to well you'll have to go through their
[2:43:22.200 --> 2:43:26.360]  selected pet puppies and then get a bigger cut to them
[2:43:26.360 --> 2:43:29.400]  and that's jp morgan chase goldman fax
[2:43:29.400 --> 2:43:35.000]  layman brothers you know the same old group of criminals

[2:43:55.800 --> 2:43:59.720]  agree with you that the form of enslaving uh the people by letting
[2:43:59.720 --> 2:44:03.000]  the bankers print the money and then lend it to us
[2:44:03.000 --> 2:44:07.720]  um however you you see that um the bible is all about fighting evil of

[2:46:16.680 --> 2:46:20.120]  the 357 all the time you shouldn't know that you should just lay down and
[2:46:20.120 --> 2:46:23.080]  take your wife and kids out and get them slaughtered because that's what god
[2:46:23.080 --> 2:46:26.280]  wants and you shouldn't even warn people about i mean take this logical
[2:46:26.280 --> 2:46:29.000]  lay down thing just let him rape us financially

[2:46:32.600 --> 2:46:38.520]  food the lord wants you to lay down to start the death of the ditch
[2:46:38.520 --> 2:46:43.320]  sorry bob go ahead no i agree oh god i mean it's you know there's a
[2:46:43.320 --> 2:46:46.920]  there's certain times you have to do things in life and you are a human being
[2:46:46.920 --> 2:46:51.320]  and you have free choice so if you want to lay down it's okay
[2:46:51.320 --> 2:46:54.920]  we'll just walk around you but i'm not going in obviously you're not going to
[2:46:54.920 --> 2:46:58.920]  lay down so that's the end of that get you and your demonic spirit out of my
[2:46:58.920 --> 2:47:02.520]  way get out of our way sorry bob i don't mean
[2:47:02.520 --> 2:47:06.040]  to get mad while you're on i just that's okay
[2:47:06.040 --> 2:47:10.200]  that's okay you know if you don't let it out you'll probably have a heart attack
[2:47:10.200 --> 2:47:14.120]  that guy's voice that weakness just drives me insane
[2:47:14.120 --> 2:47:17.880]  well you know we all have a calling in life and
[2:47:17.880 --> 2:47:21.000]  we all get a certain amount of tools to work with
[2:47:21.000 --> 2:47:25.960]  and uh there are a lot of people who have a limited amount of tools
[2:47:25.960 --> 2:47:29.320]  and so they go off in a bleak directions
[2:47:29.320 --> 2:47:32.680]  i get hey let me tell that guy something i understand that you better warn
[2:47:32.680 --> 2:47:35.320]  people about sodium fluoride and mercury in the vaccines
[2:47:35.320 --> 2:47:40.040]  at least warn somebody about something and help somebody for once in your life
[2:47:40.040 --> 2:47:44.520]  instead of just jelly fishing around with limp wrist i just can't help it
[2:47:44.520 --> 2:47:51.480]  sorry bob go ahead um i had to take dpms shots because i had so much mercury
[2:47:51.480 --> 2:47:57.480]  have you ever heard of those i think yeah yeah i had them twice
[2:47:57.480 --> 2:48:00.440]  and they put the needle in the stays in there about three or four minutes while
[2:48:00.440 --> 2:48:03.720]  i pump that i i guess it's called sludge into your
[2:48:03.720 --> 2:48:08.200]  body to clear out your your veins and get rid of the mercury but i had to go
[2:48:08.200 --> 2:48:11.720]  through that twice and i was told that i ate too much
[2:48:11.720 --> 2:48:16.040]  fish and uh and uh maybe that's so but one of the
[2:48:16.040 --> 2:48:19.320]  reasons too was i used to do a lot of reloading and not
[2:48:19.320 --> 2:48:23.400]  i'm not knowing and understanding at that time i put the primers in my mouth
[2:48:23.400 --> 2:48:27.240]  and i take them out one by one and you know and stick them in the cap
[2:48:27.240 --> 2:48:31.240]  and uh i think maybe i get some mercury doing that as well yeah absolutely
[2:48:31.240 --> 2:48:35.800]  that's what's on them all right let's go ahead and talk to chris in canada
[2:48:35.800 --> 2:48:41.560]  go ahead chris yeah nobody go ahead there a yes i am
[2:48:41.560 --> 2:48:45.800]  okay uh first of all regardless of that last color i don't understand how
[2:48:45.800 --> 2:48:50.040]  i mean they're killing us it's right in front of you and you just stand down
[2:48:50.040 --> 2:48:52.120]  because the bible tells you to ask ridiculous
[2:48:52.120 --> 2:48:55.160]  um anyway uh this is kind of a topic for today's show
[2:48:55.160 --> 2:48:59.400]  um but i read a read my local paper yesterday there was an article
[2:48:59.400 --> 2:49:02.440]  and it said the headline was the united nations
[2:49:02.440 --> 2:49:06.280]  denies water as a human right
[2:49:06.920 --> 2:49:09.960]  you're kidding i as a human right yeah everywhere they're getting ready to
[2:49:09.960 --> 2:49:13.480]  tax the water even in england where they have too much of it everywhere
[2:49:13.480 --> 2:49:16.840]  they're doing it this is only the beginning bob shabman your comments on
[2:49:16.840 --> 2:49:19.640]  that you're absolutely right and
[2:49:19.640 --> 2:49:22.760]  there's been large international corporations who
[2:49:22.760 --> 2:49:26.200]  have been trying to take over water in every country
[2:49:26.200 --> 2:49:30.680]  uh bechtel is one of them and uh there's uh a french company i forget the
[2:49:30.680 --> 2:49:33.640]  name of the artificial scarcity they're bringing that in
[2:49:33.640 --> 2:49:38.760]  yes and what they do is they've more often than not they've gone into poorer
[2:49:38.760 --> 2:49:43.160]  countries taken over the water system not repaired it
[2:49:43.160 --> 2:49:47.400]  uh raise the rates where it's taking you know 20 percent of the person's
[2:49:47.400 --> 2:49:52.120]  daily pay uh just to get water and uh and in some
[2:49:52.120 --> 2:49:54.680]  countries like peru they just threw them out
[2:49:54.680 --> 2:49:57.960]  and uh and they try to have parents that's in the imf documents they even
[2:49:57.960 --> 2:50:01.720]  have paramilitary police and then guard major rivers and reservoirs
[2:50:01.720 --> 2:50:04.440]  and they have little environmental police that watch and see if you're putting
[2:50:04.440 --> 2:50:08.520]  buckets out to get rain they they take your water in rain
[2:50:08.520 --> 2:50:12.040]  forest ladies and gentlemen and have men in black uniforms trying to keep you
[2:50:12.040 --> 2:50:14.760]  from from opening your mouth and having it go in the
[2:50:14.760 --> 2:50:17.720]  bastards want to tax the water the air everything
[2:50:17.720 --> 2:50:22.120]  and that jellyfish that called earlier probably thinks it's good
[2:50:22.120 --> 2:50:26.520]  well the way you handle that is to eliminate the guys in the black uniforms
[2:50:26.520 --> 2:50:29.320]  oh no you worship them and lick their boots
[2:50:29.320 --> 2:50:34.040]  anything else uh there chris well yeah in regards to the attacks in the air
[2:50:34.040 --> 2:50:37.000]  they've all they've already in a way i don't know about states but in Canada in
[2:50:37.000 --> 2:50:41.400]  july they they did the carbon tax and when you breathe when you

[2:54:41.720 --> 2:54:46.040]  at a story for you about black helicopters i know you got to have some
[2:54:46.040 --> 2:54:49.480]  people say it's fema it's the delta force it's the
[2:54:49.480 --> 2:54:54.200]  night stalkers out of four camel kentucky right i'm i'm actually disabled
[2:54:54.200 --> 2:54:56.840]  veteran and uh i was stationed out in
[2:54:56.840 --> 2:55:02.360]  virginia 2000 and uh next to our hanger we had a cia
[2:55:02.360 --> 2:55:06.600]  hanger next to ours on the base and uh
[2:55:06.600 --> 2:55:09.960]  we've had a bunch of scientists that you know no pictures
[2:55:09.960 --> 2:55:14.360]  uh and they were just plain loads of narcotics coming in huh
[2:55:14.360 --> 2:55:18.600]  and uh they had a lot of helicopters also that looked like there were
[2:55:18.600 --> 2:55:22.520]  civilian helicopters but you know they were also there's but
[2:55:22.520 --> 2:55:25.960]  uh the thing i was going to tell you about is they had a
[2:55:25.960 --> 2:55:29.800]  at least one i don't know how many but they had black uh i believe they're
[2:55:29.800 --> 2:55:33.560]  blackhawks if my memory serves me correctly but
[2:55:33.560 --> 2:55:38.040]  um crazy thing is you know usually when a helicopter lands
[2:55:38.040 --> 2:55:41.000]  you know they would they would land outside the hanger
[2:55:41.000 --> 2:55:46.040]  and uh then tow the tow the uh helicopter in from there
[2:55:46.040 --> 2:55:50.520]  well these things they would fly directly into the hanger
[2:55:50.520 --> 2:55:53.320]  and then they would shut the doors real fast
[2:55:53.320 --> 2:55:57.080]  uh which kind of strange you know little kids yeah
[2:55:57.080 --> 2:56:01.320]  right but i just thought i'd share that with you that's what they do pure
[2:56:01.320 --> 2:56:04.200]  demon evil right out of the pit of living hell
[2:56:04.200 --> 2:56:09.240]  bob chatman comments on that well we've seen this for many years and now it's
[2:56:09.240 --> 2:56:12.120]  become more and more obvious as they announce
[2:56:12.120 --> 2:56:16.280]  um some of their incursions of different branches of the military into
[2:56:16.280 --> 2:56:19.720]  cities and people who listen to this program are
[2:56:19.720 --> 2:56:23.880]  quite well aware of it most of the public is not and uh they're getting
[2:56:23.880 --> 2:56:27.800]  ready for civil unrest and how to round up people and
[2:56:27.800 --> 2:56:30.840]  someone and so forth and it's going to be classified they've got the helicopters
[2:56:30.840 --> 2:56:33.880]  and those hangers ready with knockout gas so it could have been that could have
[2:56:33.880 --> 2:56:38.360]  been drug trafficking little kids you never know bob
[2:56:38.920 --> 2:56:43.800]  i think uh we're going to have to visit some armories
[2:56:43.800 --> 2:56:46.600]  no i think we should just come outside when they fly over with nerve gas and
[2:56:46.600 --> 2:56:50.840]  say it is of the lord ah i think that's because you know
[2:56:50.840 --> 2:56:53.160]  that's the american thing to do that's what the founding fathers would have
[2:56:53.160 --> 2:56:58.120]  done anything else uh matt i think that's it alex
[2:56:58.120 --> 2:57:00.920]  call me back some other day tell me more we're just flat out of time here let's
[2:57:00.920 --> 2:57:04.760]  talk to bow in kentucky uh for bob chatman last caller for him go
[2:57:04.760 --> 2:57:10.680]  ahead hi alex hey bob um oh i'm just a little person
[2:57:10.680 --> 2:57:15.320]  and i just wanted to ask about copper um
[2:57:15.320 --> 2:57:18.200]  i can afford gold and silver you know blah blah but
[2:57:18.200 --> 2:57:22.440]  but copper is you know still around should i be saving it as opposed to
[2:57:22.440 --> 2:57:25.320]  recycling it when i come across them you know like
[2:57:25.320 --> 2:57:28.440]  like rich people would be saving it well i understand like when they give you
[2:57:28.440 --> 2:57:31.080]  pennies back and some of them are actually copper bob all those are the
[2:57:31.080 --> 2:57:34.600]  old ones but yeah bob well i i think if you're a copper
[2:57:34.600 --> 2:57:37.800]  collector i think you should sell it into the market because
[2:57:37.800 --> 2:57:42.760]  uh i think i think that uh those base metals are going to hold their own they
[2:57:42.760 --> 2:57:46.920]  could go somewhat higher it all depends on what events take place
[2:57:46.920 --> 2:57:50.200]  but most of the base metals have come down in price
[2:57:50.200 --> 2:57:56.120]  um copper had a high of 405 it's trading around 370 i think you should
[2:57:56.120 --> 2:58:01.160]  continue to cycle it into the market and take your profit and then perhaps
[2:58:01.160 --> 2:58:05.320]  move that over into gold and silver coins yeah take the money and run um
[2:58:05.320 --> 2:58:09.320]  thank you so much bow everybody else will get to you and dr roberts is on
[2:58:09.320 --> 2:58:13.240]  with us uh thank you so much bob chavin for popping in with us today folks

[2:58:36.280 --> 2:58:43.080]  a bone in their body and that's why we're in so much trouble

[2:59:52.760 --> 2:59:56.440]  whatever government says he is god and i i wanted to call my uncle who's one of
[2:59:56.440 --> 2:59:58.760]  the best bible scholars i know william hamlin
[2:59:58.760 --> 3:00:01.960]  and had him comment but butch paugh who's a talk show host writer on the
[3:00:01.960 --> 3:00:06.280]  network of pastor um who's also an expert on this and made some
[3:00:06.280 --> 3:00:09.480]  documentaries about it called in so we've got this segment and part of the
[3:00:09.480 --> 3:00:13.160]  next for dr roberts comes on because i wanted to address this now
[3:00:13.160 --> 3:00:17.720]  and i wanted to go to my uncle uh william uh go ahead and just spend a few
[3:00:17.720 --> 3:00:22.760]  minutes giving people verses or try to explain to this person that it's
[3:00:22.760 --> 3:00:25.560]  i mean i'm not even a bible expert the whole bible is about standing up
[3:00:25.560 --> 3:00:28.520]  against tyranny uh what's going on with these people
[3:00:28.520 --> 3:00:31.880]  you call me alex i'm sorry i'm gonna go to my uncle first william go ahead go
[3:00:31.880 --> 3:00:36.280]  ahead i'll be right here um hello everybody uh all for history
[3:00:36.280 --> 3:00:39.960]  both in the bible and with most theologians there's been the concept
[3:00:39.960 --> 3:00:46.120]  of just war just resistance unjust war unjust resistance and the
[3:00:46.120 --> 3:00:49.880]  the word of god is pretty clear that uh
[3:00:49.880 --> 3:00:56.040]  wars just wars and involve defense whereas unjust wars and unjust
[3:00:56.040 --> 3:01:01.080]  resistance involves aggression or uh open rebellion for rebellion's
[3:01:01.080 --> 3:01:07.560]  sake or for material reasons so in the word of god we see
[3:01:07.560 --> 3:01:10.600]  that we're always juggling with this and we are to obey
[3:01:10.600 --> 3:01:15.000]  roman's 13 has that kernel of truth however when the government
[3:01:15.000 --> 3:01:18.600]  is clearly violating every single tenet
[3:01:18.600 --> 3:01:22.840]  of the word of god and that which the constitution and the nation
[3:01:22.840 --> 3:01:29.320]  was established upon uh right down to our right to life of our unborn babies
[3:01:29.320 --> 3:01:33.560]  and our right to defend our own lives then we know
[3:01:33.560 --> 3:01:37.480]  that we're bumping up against uh unjust activity
[3:01:37.480 --> 3:01:41.000]  and the activities of an aggressor there is a scripture
[3:01:41.000 --> 3:01:46.760]  that says at the end in the kingdom that the swords will be beaten into plows
[3:01:46.760 --> 3:01:49.960]  chairs but there's also an old testament scripture
[3:01:49.960 --> 3:01:53.320]  calling for a just war that says beat your plowshares
[3:01:53.320 --> 3:01:58.840]  into swords and jesus himself said at the very end of his ministry
[3:01:58.840 --> 3:02:03.160]  when he was advising his disciples and his apostles he said if you've got two
[3:02:03.160 --> 3:02:08.040]  coats sell one and buy a sword so he recognized
[3:02:08.040 --> 3:02:11.800]  that it was going to be terrible resistance to truth and righteousness
[3:02:11.800 --> 3:02:15.320]  and it wasn't to be taken lying down doing nothing
[3:02:15.320 --> 3:02:19.320]  okay now stop there i'm gonna bring you guys back butch give them some verses
[3:02:19.320 --> 3:02:22.840]  well if you go to second king's chapter 11 you'll find in there very clearly
[3:02:22.840 --> 3:02:27.240]  what you're holding at a high priest of the day the preacher the head preacher
[3:02:27.240 --> 3:02:32.120]  dethroned an unjust leader a queen and had her killed for a daring
[3:02:32.120 --> 3:02:34.760]  disrepent authority over over uh righteous government
[3:02:34.760 --> 3:02:38.280]  and your uncle just mentioned almost 13 tells us to obey
[3:02:38.280 --> 3:02:41.640]  powers but if you read down it in verse verses three and four
[3:02:41.640 --> 3:02:45.000]  those powers are to be ministers of god to our good
[3:02:45.000 --> 3:02:49.080]  that word minister it means deacon that government itself is to be a
[3:02:49.080 --> 3:02:52.280]  deacon to glorify god and identify the good of the people
[3:02:52.280 --> 3:02:56.440]  if it ceases to do good it ceases to be righteous government and then we are
[3:02:56.440 --> 3:03:00.520]  required by god's law in his commandments to resist that evil by
[3:03:00.520 --> 3:03:04.600]  all means necessary and and bush the whole bible i don't
[3:03:04.600 --> 3:03:07.720]  know where to start is about people standing up against evil
[3:03:07.720 --> 3:03:11.320]  i again uh the whole bible is written on the on the
[3:03:11.320 --> 3:03:14.520]  nema chapter four it talks about uh resisting evil
[3:03:14.520 --> 3:03:17.960]  uh in the old testament christ as your uncle said the total disciples look
[3:03:17.960 --> 3:03:22.040]  236 to buy a sword that wasn't for slicing cheese and cleaner toenails that
[3:03:22.040 --> 3:03:24.840]  was a fight with these are things that are clearly
[3:03:24.840 --> 3:03:27.800]  written in the scriptures and people got the quit listening to these manby
[3:03:27.800 --> 3:03:31.560]  panby poppy pimps they're getting paid to to tickle their ears
[3:03:31.560 --> 3:03:35.160]  understand we're here to fight evil we're here to expose it and fight it
[3:03:35.160 --> 3:03:39.400]  paul wrote roman's 13 from prison why was he in prison for a bayan
[3:03:39.400 --> 3:03:43.800]  seizure or for disobeying seizure why did they kill so many the prophets why
[3:03:43.800 --> 3:03:47.160]  did they do all that if they were to follow and grovel the government
[3:03:47.160 --> 3:03:50.200]  and by this extension the founding fathers are bad
[3:03:50.200 --> 3:03:54.040]  uh fighting hitler was bad because it's all of god isn't it
[3:03:54.040 --> 3:03:58.760]  well uh if people just take time to look the bible what it says if we're trying
[3:03:58.760 --> 3:04:02.920]  to wheeze away around this they are accountable for the evil around
[3:04:02.920 --> 3:04:06.120]  them if we if we are not fighting evil we're not
[3:04:06.120 --> 3:04:08.920]  doing the will of our father well you're aiding it and the blood is on your
[3:04:08.920 --> 3:04:10.680]  hands i want to talk behind the scenes for the
[3:04:10.680 --> 3:04:13.560]  internet listeners right now we're going to skip this break everybody else will
[3:04:13.560 --> 3:04:20.360]  be right back
[3:04:20.360 --> 3:04:26.760]  guys i know this is uh on uh really uh short notice but i i mean it's crazy
[3:04:26.760 --> 3:04:31.000]  it's all the prophets are being killed put in prison they're refusing to do
[3:04:31.000 --> 3:04:34.920]  what evil kings say in israel outside israel babel on egypt
[3:04:34.920 --> 3:04:38.760]  according to them they should have done what uh what what pharaoh said
[3:04:38.760 --> 3:04:42.520]  uh they should have done uh what uh all of them said
[3:04:42.520 --> 3:04:46.440]  jesus should have done with the high priest and and and harrod said
[3:04:46.440 --> 3:04:50.040]  i mean this is unbelievable and and and it's taught
[3:04:50.040 --> 3:04:53.400]  everywhere to not even warn people because that's speaking out against the
[3:04:53.400 --> 3:04:57.640]  government to take your shots let them kill you do whatever they say
[3:04:57.640 --> 3:05:02.200]  it's insanity it's unbiblical uh and i'll make one comment your uncle can
[3:05:02.200 --> 3:05:06.600]  talk all your life too because this is a point that is so so important today
[3:05:06.600 --> 3:05:10.520]  that if we render to seizure why it's not seizures on my
[3:05:10.520 --> 3:05:14.280]  or my website pastor butch.com there's a three-year video in back and watch for
[3:05:14.280 --> 3:05:17.720]  free entitled render in a seizure explain if we give
[3:05:17.720 --> 3:05:20.840]  unto him what is not he is we make seizure our god
[3:05:20.840 --> 3:05:26.520]  we deny our god and hell is our damn nation just that simple and going back
[3:05:26.520 --> 3:05:30.920]  to my uncle uh you want to make some more comments here
[3:05:30.920 --> 3:05:36.120]  well not only is the bible on our side but history is on our side has uh as
[3:05:36.120 --> 3:05:40.440]  believers because in a practical sense christianity would not exist
[3:05:40.440 --> 3:05:44.600]  today if no resistance had taken place throughout history
[3:05:44.600 --> 3:05:48.520]  look at what the romans tried to do to the believers
[3:05:48.520 --> 3:05:51.880]  it's almost unspeakable they should have followed what what the emperor said
[3:05:51.880 --> 3:05:56.520]  and worship saturn uh and and mars right there they are bad according to what
[3:05:56.520 --> 3:05:59.480]  that guy said they should have they should have made sacrifices to the
[3:05:59.480 --> 3:06:03.400]  roman gods well the point i just made what paul wrote most of the testament
[3:06:03.400 --> 3:06:06.680]  from prison he was in prison for a bayon seizure he was there because he did not
[3:06:06.680 --> 3:06:10.280]  obey seizure near my chat i'm sorry numbers chapter one numbers is
[3:06:10.280 --> 3:06:13.800]  called the war book in the bible numbers chapter one is where our forefathers
[3:06:13.800 --> 3:06:16.760]  got the idea of a militia the bn military
[3:06:16.760 --> 3:06:20.600]  those for this is where our forefathers said we will just establish a severe
[3:06:20.600 --> 3:06:24.600]  militia in our country uh and to protect our our states and our
[3:06:24.600 --> 3:06:28.200]  nation that's in there by well let me stop you uh going back
[3:06:28.200 --> 3:06:32.520]  uh to the founding fathers going back to the bible
[3:06:32.520 --> 3:06:36.200]  uh paul was somebody who hunted down and killed christians
[3:06:36.200 --> 3:06:39.720]  until he got knocked off his horse and became paul from soliff tarsis
[3:06:39.720 --> 3:06:43.400]  on the road to demascus so so there it is that christians weren't following
[3:06:43.400 --> 3:06:46.200]  orders he was going around hunting them down
[3:06:46.200 --> 3:06:49.960]  exactly that's they were resisting the civil authorities
[3:06:49.960 --> 3:06:53.720]  and the church of the day and the church today very good point
[3:06:53.720 --> 3:06:57.080]  the so-called church they because they will not go along with the customs of
[3:06:57.080 --> 3:07:01.320]  the church they said this is not right christ is christ is the messiah
[3:07:01.320 --> 3:07:04.520]  they were being persecuted by the church and by the civil authority and we are
[3:07:04.520 --> 3:07:07.480]  today also a percent of the truth i were to come back to the main audience in
[3:07:07.480 --> 3:07:12.040]  15 seconds uh and so recap other key points both of
[3:07:12.040 --> 3:07:15.160]  you got about two minutes of peace on the other side we'll go back to my uncle
[3:07:15.160 --> 3:07:20.280]  william uh and then to you butch uh right now here we go
[3:07:21.000 --> 3:07:27.560]  ease the t rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network paul
[3:07:27.560 --> 3:07:31.240]  himself was soliff tarsis went around hunting down and killing christians
[3:07:31.240 --> 3:07:34.760]  because they wouldn't submit to the civil or the religious authority and then
[3:07:34.760 --> 3:07:38.760]  of course he got knocked off his horse uh on the way to demascus saw the light
[3:07:38.760 --> 3:07:42.200]  was imprisoned i mean how did paul end up how did the other
[3:07:42.200 --> 3:07:46.280]  disciples end up my uncle william hamman and of course basher butch paul
[3:07:46.280 --> 3:07:49.000]  jenesis network hosted eight o'clock at night central
[3:07:49.000 --> 3:07:53.800]  uh i want my uncle to have a two-minute closing comment and then butch then
[3:07:53.800 --> 3:07:58.040]  we're going to get um dr paul craig roberts on right now
[3:07:58.040 --> 3:08:01.320]  thank you we were looking at the historical perspective and we've come
[3:08:01.320 --> 3:08:06.440]  down to the inquisition which was a coldly calculated move for about 800 or
[3:08:06.440 --> 3:08:11.400]  900 years to totally wipe out through christianity if there had been no
[3:08:11.400 --> 3:08:15.560]  resistance again christianity would not exist today
[3:08:15.560 --> 3:08:19.080]  and moving to the tyranny of the kings of england had there been
[3:08:19.080 --> 3:08:23.400]  no resistance to the kings there would have been no america because the people
[3:08:23.400 --> 3:08:27.880]  came here to found this place looking for freedom of faith
[3:08:27.880 --> 3:08:32.440]  uh look at martin luther if he had not been not martin luther king martin
[3:08:32.440 --> 3:08:36.040]  luther of the reformation if martin luther had not
[3:08:36.040 --> 3:08:39.560]  been backed by the arms of the german princes
[3:08:39.560 --> 3:08:42.840]  there would have been no reformation it would have been swept away in a few
[3:08:42.840 --> 3:08:47.160]  days by the papal army so there was a lot of resistance there and finally
[3:08:47.160 --> 3:08:52.200]  i'd like to say that when jesus comes back and it's very soon it's at the door
[3:08:52.200 --> 3:08:55.560]  he's not coming back as a lamb he's coming back
[3:08:55.560 --> 3:09:00.040]  as a lion of juda amen with 10 000 times 10 000 saints
[3:09:00.040 --> 3:09:05.880]  with a mighty sword to wipe out his enemies completely at the battle of
[3:09:05.880 --> 3:09:08.680]  armageddon i would call that total resistance wouldn't
[3:09:08.680 --> 3:09:13.480]  you alex amen i just don't understand but
[3:09:13.480 --> 3:09:18.120]  the the the groveling chicken neck love of tyranny and they always have the same
[3:09:18.120 --> 3:09:22.600]  voice the same spirit of oh the bible says lay down
[3:09:22.600 --> 3:09:27.240]  and it's just like oh they're just like oh i mean what has happened to these
[3:09:27.240 --> 3:09:29.240]  people i like to say that they have been brainwashed
[3:09:29.240 --> 3:09:32.680]  they are brainwashed it's a fact that's simply compared to have been brainwashed
[3:09:32.680 --> 3:09:36.920]  by the pastors they do not say the word for themselves and i did and as they're
[3:09:36.920 --> 3:09:40.280]  also afraid and they think laying down is going to keep them safe
[3:09:40.280 --> 3:09:43.000]  well they're they're they're they're waiting for the rapture they're not
[3:09:43.000 --> 3:09:45.640]  concerned they're waiting you know they don't do anything get involved they
[3:09:45.640 --> 3:09:48.440]  don't want to lose their stuff they worship the god this world and the
[3:09:48.440 --> 3:09:51.400]  ender and their position more than they worship the almighty
[3:09:51.400 --> 3:09:54.280]  and i'm telling you again the damnation is going to be there just reward
[3:09:54.280 --> 3:09:58.120]  but again as i told you a few minutes ago that in numbers chapter one or four
[3:09:58.120 --> 3:10:01.160]  problems got the idea of a of a civilian militia
[3:10:01.160 --> 3:10:04.200]  after that at the second amendment was given a constitution for us
[3:10:04.200 --> 3:10:07.160]  for the duty for us to overthrow unrighteous leaders it's our duty it's
[3:10:07.160 --> 3:10:11.000]  not just her all right it's our duty this is a christian duty
[3:10:11.000 --> 3:10:14.440]  to to glorify our god all through history
[3:10:14.440 --> 3:10:17.160]  all through history the battle has always been
[3:10:17.160 --> 3:10:22.280]  from mankind overthrow unjust tyrants for the sake of freedom
[3:10:22.280 --> 3:10:25.560]  and christ come to give us all freedom but this is where the where the spirit
[3:10:25.560 --> 3:10:29.720]  of lord is there is freedom and until we stand and there is liberty until we
[3:10:29.720 --> 3:10:34.360]  stand for that as men and women who defy men who try to be gods
[3:10:34.360 --> 3:10:37.960]  we do not deserve freedom we deserve what we what we're getting
[3:10:37.960 --> 3:10:41.400]  absolutely god helped the people that don't understand it because i promise
[3:10:41.400 --> 3:10:45.560]  you paydays coming i hear you gentlemen thanks for joining us
[3:10:45.560 --> 3:10:49.080]  and that really is thank you that really is the crux of the problem
[3:10:49.080 --> 3:10:53.000]  that you have tens of billions of dollars 26 000
[3:10:53.000 --> 3:10:56.280]  now they're done a double that number by next year fema pastors we told you
[3:10:56.280 --> 3:10:59.720]  this one was secret it's now public trained to tell their flocks turn your
[3:10:59.720 --> 3:11:03.000]  guns in go to fema camps let the government take your children
[3:11:03.000 --> 3:11:05.960]  i mean this is right out of nazi germany soviet russia
[3:11:05.960 --> 3:11:11.320]  and uh that's why one of the main reasons we can't get this country moving
[3:11:11.320 --> 3:11:16.200]  is that the churches are bought and paid for by these corporate interests
[3:11:16.200 --> 3:11:20.440]  and uh are out there spewing the line of this government
[3:11:20.440 --> 3:11:24.680]  and i am just completely blown away by it every time one of those people calls
[3:11:24.680 --> 3:11:28.600]  in and says if you're a christian you're supposed to not stand up against tyranny
[3:11:28.600 --> 3:11:32.840]  and when it's just totally crazy number one i had a financial guest on
[3:11:32.840 --> 3:11:36.120]  my financial news and this guy calls in saying you know we basically
[3:11:36.120 --> 3:11:38.360]  shouldn't even criticize the federal reserve
[3:11:38.360 --> 3:11:42.440]  because god says i mean i i just can't handle this anymore
[3:11:42.440 --> 3:11:47.240]  i mean it's just so crazy now if you want to go off in a ditch and be a slave
[3:11:47.240 --> 3:11:50.920]  go ahead just get out of my way get behind me
[3:11:50.920 --> 3:11:55.640]  do we have dr roberts he's also okay thank you so much

[3:12:50.760 --> 3:12:53.960]  so much has happened since he was last with us a few weeks ago
[3:12:53.960 --> 3:12:57.880]  dr roberts thanks for coming on hello roberts
[3:12:57.880 --> 3:13:01.720]  hey just a side issue before we get into the economy in the in the in
[3:13:01.720 --> 3:13:05.880]  conures blocking a real impeachment hearing uh coming up this friday we had
[3:13:05.880 --> 3:13:09.000]  coincidence on yesterday what do you think of all these mainline
[3:13:09.000 --> 3:13:11.400]  christians that call into shows i'm sure you've heard them i know you've
[3:13:11.400 --> 3:13:14.920]  written about them saying do whatever government says roman's 13
[3:13:14.920 --> 3:13:20.920]  don't fight tyranny tortures good kill all the iraqis it's of the lord
[3:13:20.920 --> 3:13:24.680]  uh now they're getting so crazy pastor hagi saying jesus isn't even
[3:13:24.680 --> 3:13:27.640]  the the savior i mean i know you don't get into religious stuff but the point
[3:13:27.640 --> 3:13:33.160]  is it's really getting wacky right now oh yeah what pants is for
[3:13:33.160 --> 3:13:41.080]  evangelical christianity is uh uh far more barbaric and warlike
[3:13:41.080 --> 3:13:45.400]  religion than what they what they claim his law is
[3:13:45.400 --> 3:13:49.720]  so i i see these people as a great threat to humanity
[3:13:49.720 --> 3:13:53.080]  and it's certainly not christians there's nothing christian about them they're
[3:13:53.080 --> 3:13:57.560]  thugs they want to murder women and children and drop nukes on people that
[3:13:57.560 --> 3:14:02.120]  they don't even know i don't know what to make of it
[3:14:02.120 --> 3:14:06.920]  it sounds like that everybody's crazy is that the
[3:14:06.920 --> 3:14:11.640]  sect uh it went down there wherever it was john the jones
[3:14:11.640 --> 3:14:14.520]  sect and they all drank kool-aid and killed themselves
[3:14:14.520 --> 3:14:17.880]  poison kool-aid well i mean we hear this mantra in fact i even heard a guy on
[3:14:17.880 --> 3:14:21.320]  the network yesterday on another show saying
[3:14:21.320 --> 3:14:25.960]  that uh ockman denigine once nuclear war has a bomb is going to nuke
[3:14:25.960 --> 3:14:29.480]  israel israel's defenseless does he know anything like that he
[3:14:29.480 --> 3:14:33.800]  he's obviously doesn't have any information saying whatever comes into
[3:14:33.800 --> 3:14:36.200]  it well well that's my question pat robertson got up
[3:14:36.200 --> 3:14:39.560]  yesterday we have the clip and said they're gonna get the a bomb israel
[3:14:39.560 --> 3:14:43.080]  has to hit them uh it's of the lord i mean this is the
[3:14:43.080 --> 3:14:45.880]  same group that lied about iraq and the lord
[3:14:45.880 --> 3:14:49.400]  look alex these are not christians these are murderers
[3:14:49.400 --> 3:14:54.200]  liars they're thugs they're worse than the nazis
[3:14:54.200 --> 3:14:57.960]  they're not christians there's nothing christian
[3:14:57.960 --> 3:15:05.400]  or religious about them they're thugs murderers liars
[3:15:05.400 --> 3:15:09.880]  they are great threat to the continued existence
[3:15:09.880 --> 3:15:13.000]  of life on earth now i agree with you i'm saying
[3:15:13.000 --> 3:15:16.280]  i understand the kingpins are just manipulating their minions and are
[3:15:16.280 --> 3:15:20.040]  secular but my point is how do they get all these little church ladies
[3:15:20.040 --> 3:15:23.800]  to just be complete p-brains it's it's it's mind control because they have p
[3:15:23.800 --> 3:15:28.760]  brains to start with look alex never forget
[3:15:28.760 --> 3:15:34.920]  that at least half the population is under the left side of the bell curve
[3:15:34.920 --> 3:15:39.960]  and i sometimes think alex that the entire american population is under the
[3:15:39.960 --> 3:15:43.720]  left side of the bell curve
[3:15:45.080 --> 3:15:48.680]  well there's no doubt that it's it's we've had it too good too long and they're
[3:15:48.680 --> 3:15:51.480]  just have no idea the dark waters are swimming in
[3:15:51.480 --> 3:15:55.480]  part of of getting the population ready for the
[3:15:55.480 --> 3:16:02.120]  assault on aran this is israel's look everybody who's
[3:16:02.120 --> 3:16:07.320]  knowledge of one form knows that israel it has turned down it's now on the
[3:16:07.320 --> 3:16:10.040]  decline united states is on the decline in fact we're
[3:16:10.040 --> 3:16:14.440]  totally dependent now on the chinese to finance the daily operation of our own
[3:16:14.440 --> 3:16:19.240]  government so we're both on the decline our power is
[3:16:19.240 --> 3:16:24.200]  evaporating before our eyes israel has twice been defeated by the hezbollah
[3:16:24.200 --> 3:16:29.720]  militia the famed and vulnerable israeli army
[3:16:29.720 --> 3:16:35.160]  got its ass kicked twice driven out of lebanon by a few
[3:16:35.160 --> 3:16:40.120]  thousand militia the powers on decline this is the last
[3:16:40.120 --> 3:16:43.880]  chance bush assuming he doesn't pull a fast one
[3:16:43.880 --> 3:16:50.200]  will be gone in six months so right now they got their finger on the button
[3:16:50.200 --> 3:16:53.880]  and they're they're gonna push and push and push
[3:16:53.880 --> 3:16:58.040]  and try to get the situation where
[3:16:58.040 --> 3:17:03.880]  their attack on their own aran will be tolerated and so that's what they're
[3:17:03.880 --> 3:17:07.720]  using the churches for they've got all this out
[3:17:07.720 --> 3:17:11.800]  into the churches there and that's what it's all about i agree with you and
[3:17:11.800 --> 3:17:14.760]  rey mcgovern ron paul deniz kasinich the list
[3:17:14.760 --> 3:17:19.400]  is legion all say that that that they are gonna attack ron paul says in
[3:17:19.400 --> 3:17:22.840]  congress it's a done deal they're gonna attack
[3:17:22.840 --> 3:17:27.080]  if obama gets elected they're gonna attack right after the election
[3:17:27.080 --> 3:17:30.040]  if mccain gets elected it'll be right when he gets in office
[3:17:30.040 --> 3:17:34.840]  probably a stage terror attack to bring that in
[3:17:34.840 --> 3:17:38.040]  yeah well i i don't know if they'll get away with it
[3:17:38.040 --> 3:17:41.720]  but i certainly agree that that's what they want to do
[3:17:41.720 --> 3:17:45.000]  your idea sir to stop this is there any way to stop
[3:17:45.000 --> 3:17:49.000]  the the total destruction of our country
[3:17:50.440 --> 3:17:55.320]  well um i don't think that they're saying
[3:17:55.320 --> 3:18:00.680]  i don't think that they live in a factual reality
[3:18:00.680 --> 3:18:06.520]  um so i think that uh they want to do it bad enough they'll
[3:18:06.520 --> 3:18:13.560]  fool themselves that that they can but i think it will leave
[3:18:13.560 --> 3:18:17.880]  it will accelerate the collapse of american power
[3:18:17.880 --> 3:18:23.640]  and israeli power and if we think that our invasions of the
[3:18:23.640 --> 3:18:28.120]  iraq and afghanistan and the israeli bombings of
[3:18:28.120 --> 3:18:34.440]  the civilian lebanese population and their mirrors and gausser the west bank
[3:18:34.440 --> 3:18:40.520]  and radicalized muslims just wait until we knew they're in
[3:18:40.520 --> 3:18:44.680]  and then most likely all of our puppets will fall
[3:18:44.680 --> 3:18:50.760]  in the middle east uh israel will probably be exterminated
[3:18:50.760 --> 3:18:54.920]  uh americans won't be able to borrow a dime

[3:23:00.520 --> 3:23:03.400]  imagine if i'd come to you a couple of years ago and said to you
[3:23:03.400 --> 3:23:07.000]  hey gasoline prices are going to jump to five dollars a gallon
[3:23:07.000 --> 3:23:10.120]  and i know a way that we can store several hundred gallons for you
[3:23:10.120 --> 3:23:14.360]  a year or two supply of gasoline buy it today at two bucks a gallon
[3:23:14.360 --> 3:23:17.080]  and when it goes to five bucks a gallon you'll be way ahead of the game
[3:23:17.080 --> 3:23:19.560]  and you'll probably at the time would have said to me you're nuts get away
[3:23:19.560 --> 3:23:23.880]  you're crazy little dick go bye bye and okay fine now i'm telling you
[3:23:23.880 --> 3:23:29.240]  what's happened to gasoline is happening to food your grocery bills
[3:23:29.240 --> 3:23:32.600]  we've got to do our duty consequence belongs to gun we've got to try to
[3:23:32.600 --> 3:23:35.880]  warn people what this war is going to mean
[3:23:35.880 --> 3:23:41.400]  the economy to our name the military uh i'm seeing mainline reports where the
[3:23:41.400 --> 3:23:45.080]  transport planes are full of garbage the seats are all
[3:23:45.080 --> 3:23:49.880]  falling apart meanwhile the air force and army flying luxury aircraft
[3:23:49.880 --> 3:23:53.160]  that uh there's cockroaches and rats and all them
[3:23:53.160 --> 3:23:56.600]  and a whole bunch of the major v a's toilets overflowing at bragg
[3:23:56.600 --> 3:23:59.400]  i'm talking to army people saying they never see anything like it
[3:23:59.400 --> 3:24:02.760]  that the bases are falling apart i mean it really looks like the government has
[3:24:02.760 --> 3:24:06.520]  gone completely insane dr roberts
[3:24:06.520 --> 3:24:11.800]  well it not only looks like it's a fact
[3:24:12.520 --> 3:24:17.080]  you won't get any argument out of me on that score alec
[3:24:18.440 --> 3:24:22.440]  i think that's another important sign of just the disconnect from reality we're
[3:24:22.440 --> 3:24:26.520]  seeing in the power structure dr roberts
[3:24:26.520 --> 3:24:30.360]  well uh don't you know they bragged on how disconnected they were
[3:24:30.360 --> 3:24:35.400]  that they would they would create the reality and we'd have to go find out
[3:24:35.400 --> 3:24:41.400]  what it was so they don't accept any limits
[3:24:41.400 --> 3:24:47.800]  they think they're omniscient and um and it's so hilarious because
[3:24:47.800 --> 3:24:51.000]  these are the guys that can't act far back dead
[3:24:51.000 --> 3:24:55.560]  these are the guys that have to rely on the chinese to pay their salaries
[3:24:55.560 --> 3:25:00.040]  and uh lend us money to pay so security with us
[3:25:00.040 --> 3:25:06.360]  lend us money to buy fuel for the for the planes we use to bond
[3:25:06.360 --> 3:25:09.480]  civilians and the middle east and africa
[3:25:09.480 --> 3:25:14.840]  wherever and yet they think they're omniscient
[3:25:14.840 --> 3:25:18.840]  we already decided didn't we that they were insane
[3:25:18.840 --> 3:25:24.040]  so of course that means they're a huge danger to us
[3:25:24.040 --> 3:25:27.640]  what is the best course of action to try to stop this from happening or if it's
[3:25:27.640 --> 3:25:30.520]  going to happen what what do you think people should do
[3:25:30.520 --> 3:25:34.680]  i don't think people are short of taking up arms
[3:25:34.680 --> 3:25:38.840]  during what thomas jeff said that we needed to do every 200 years and of
[3:25:38.840 --> 3:25:45.160]  course he lived in a time of very slow change so 200 years he would
[3:25:45.160 --> 3:25:48.360]  probably shorten that he was around the day
[3:25:48.360 --> 3:25:52.440]  other than you know i was throwing the government starting over
[3:25:52.440 --> 3:25:56.120]  there's nothing we can do because they don't listen to us the people
[3:25:56.120 --> 3:26:00.840]  don't count which is made clear there's no interest in public opinion
[3:26:00.840 --> 3:26:05.800]  uh the democrats aren't either we mean the the
[3:26:05.800 --> 3:26:09.800]  electorate tried to stop it when we elected the democrats
[3:26:09.800 --> 3:26:13.640]  in 2006 and the democrats did nothing
[3:26:13.640 --> 3:26:17.480]  did not use the power why do you think konyers and palosia are blocking any
[3:26:17.480 --> 3:26:23.880]  impeachment fear paid off money they've been bought
[3:26:23.880 --> 3:26:27.640]  somebody's put you know 10 20 30 million dollars on the council and
[3:26:27.640 --> 3:26:32.200]  where for that's my view of it i mean i can't prove that nobody
[3:26:32.200 --> 3:26:35.720]  prove it but i think they're all bald they're not any
[3:26:35.720 --> 3:26:38.840]  sincere people who who do we know that's sincere
[3:26:38.840 --> 3:26:43.560]  in politics ron paul and then it's just finished and ron paul almost died a few
[3:26:43.560 --> 3:26:45.560]  days ago you i'm sure you heard about that
[3:26:45.560 --> 3:26:49.720]  no i didn't the depressurization and nose dive of the aircraft
[3:26:49.720 --> 3:26:54.360]  no i didn't know with seven congressmen on board
[3:26:54.360 --> 3:26:57.560]  well maybe that was a warning
[3:26:58.600 --> 3:27:01.320]  listen i don't want to get too conspiratorial
[3:27:01.320 --> 3:27:07.480]  um and i don't want to get people to you know down and give up but i think we
[3:27:07.480 --> 3:27:12.120]  reached the point now where it's out of my hand uh the question
[3:27:12.120 --> 3:27:17.480]  really is uh how the rising powers do this the rising powers are
[3:27:17.480 --> 3:27:23.800]  china russia india in 20 years they'll rule the world we'll be
[3:27:23.800 --> 3:27:27.640]  nothing and the question is how will they
[3:27:27.640 --> 3:27:33.000]  hear this um do the russians want regular activity
[3:27:33.000 --> 3:27:37.640]  you know on the on their borders uh they're the chinese won't
[3:27:37.640 --> 3:27:42.680]  all their energy investments destroyed in iran
[3:27:42.680 --> 3:27:49.160]  um the europeans uh won't us for their large muslim
[3:27:49.160 --> 3:27:52.520]  populations who probably radicalized by
[3:27:52.520 --> 3:27:57.160]  um and whether or not any of them do anything or whether they all say well
[3:27:57.160 --> 3:28:00.520]  look let's just let the fools go ahead because this is the best way to get rid
[3:28:00.520 --> 3:28:03.000]  of america well that's what the russians are saying they're
[3:28:03.000 --> 3:28:07.160]  saying go ahead fools yeah i think maybe that's
[3:28:07.160 --> 3:28:10.760]  i think that's what the chinese decided that
[3:28:10.760 --> 3:28:15.720]  um rather than interfere and then get in a conflict
[3:28:15.720 --> 3:28:20.040]  with us that might re-enter jazzers in some other way
[3:28:20.040 --> 3:28:24.040]  they'll just let us go on try to do them you know nobody tried to stop hit look
[3:28:24.040 --> 3:28:28.520]  from marching into germany but when he did that the british
[3:28:28.520 --> 3:28:36.120]  church hill said well now he won so i don't think anybody will stop us
[3:28:36.120 --> 3:28:40.200]  and in order to save the iranians because they haven't got anything to do
[3:28:40.200 --> 3:28:45.000]  with iranians so they've got a lot against us and if we self-destruct

[3:34:05.880 --> 3:34:08.280]  we can only hope to collapse like the soviet union that's what all the
[3:34:08.280 --> 3:34:11.960]  experts are saying instead of just going on and hit larry an event

[3:34:51.800 --> 3:34:55.160]  that dr roberts has a bestselling book now in its second edition
[3:34:55.160 --> 3:34:58.840]  the tyranny of good intentions you need to get it to see how they're setting up
[3:34:58.840 --> 3:35:02.600]  a total police state here in the united states it's in bookstores everywhere
[3:35:02.600 --> 3:35:04.440]  in fact i was at the bookstore about a month ago and saw it
[3:35:04.440 --> 3:35:07.720]  stack of them sitting there so be sure and get that even if you know all about
[3:35:07.720 --> 3:35:09.960]  this stuff get it and give it to somebody that reads
[3:35:09.960 --> 3:35:13.320]  in your family who's not fully awakened because that's the only way to stop this
[3:35:13.320 --> 3:35:16.600]  is educating people one one step at a time
[3:35:16.600 --> 3:35:19.720]  dr roberts briefly as i want to go to calls while we have you
[3:35:19.720 --> 3:35:24.120]  for people that want to talk to you um the economy give us a a rundown with
[3:35:24.120 --> 3:35:28.760]  your expertise on the current state of affairs and where you see it going
[3:35:28.760 --> 3:35:32.600]  okay i'll let you know the situation is different than ever before
[3:35:32.600 --> 3:35:36.520]  these financial instruments are different the risks that people have taken
[3:35:36.520 --> 3:35:42.200]  are much greater uh the the damage is far more widespread
[3:35:42.200 --> 3:35:46.520]  the most likely outcome in my opinion we're going to have a
[3:35:46.520 --> 3:35:56.040]  a inflationary recession serious recession inflationary
[3:35:56.040 --> 3:36:00.040]  not deflationary because the federal reserve
[3:36:00.040 --> 3:36:08.200]  is going to supply the liquidity to make whole all of these bad investments
[3:36:08.200 --> 3:36:12.360]  and therefore there's going to be an outpouring of money
[3:36:12.360 --> 3:36:17.000]  but it's going to have literally no effect in raising employment
[3:36:17.000 --> 3:36:20.680]  so we're going to have high inflation high unemployment it's going to be a
[3:36:20.680 --> 3:36:26.920]  very difficult situation to get out of because the the policy
[3:36:26.920 --> 3:36:31.960]  levers just don't exist to deal with that counter catastrophe
[3:36:31.960 --> 3:36:36.520]  it's amazing that the government of the united states
[3:36:36.520 --> 3:36:43.480]  was capable of producing such an unholy mess when you think it wasn't that long
[3:36:43.480 --> 3:36:47.560]  ago we had a very strong economy
[3:36:47.560 --> 3:36:50.760]  reagan gave us back the economy we were growing
[3:36:50.760 --> 3:36:56.040]  without rising inflation everything is fine it's just completely
[3:36:56.040 --> 3:37:00.920]  wrecked it and they've now got a situation as i said
[3:37:00.920 --> 3:37:04.680]  that i think it will be an inflationary
[3:37:04.680 --> 3:37:10.040]  recession that they will have no way to get out of
[3:37:10.040 --> 3:37:16.360]  so it's not good nothing nothing good there's no
[3:37:16.360 --> 3:37:21.720]  leadership there's no awareness they're full of hubris they still
[3:37:21.720 --> 3:37:27.800]  think they're a superpower what can you do isn't that the
[3:37:27.800 --> 3:37:31.240]  historically the worst combination to have a retracting
[3:37:31.240 --> 3:37:36.040]  contracting economy while you have inflation going into hyperinflation
[3:37:36.040 --> 3:37:41.480]  or is there any other oh so what is the worst that is the worst you nailed it
[3:37:41.480 --> 3:37:49.240]  alex you nailed it that is the worst situation and there's no obvious
[3:37:49.240 --> 3:37:53.720]  remedy in fact the remedy is so serious
[3:37:53.720 --> 3:38:01.000]  devil cult and imposing such cost that people shall away from it
[3:38:01.000 --> 3:38:04.280]  well isn't that it we have an infantile public that can't deal with interest
[3:38:04.280 --> 3:38:08.200]  rate hikes or with tariffs or with other things or with
[3:38:08.200 --> 3:38:12.040]  investment in manufacturing they want things that are instant and so instead
[3:38:12.040 --> 3:38:14.920]  they're going to give us kind of the morphine putting us into
[3:38:14.920 --> 3:38:19.800]  into a coma and then economic death collapse
[3:38:19.800 --> 3:38:23.000]  yeah i think you know people are not going to be able to afford
[3:38:23.000 --> 3:38:26.200]  anything and i have income the government's going to pay us bills by
[3:38:26.200 --> 3:38:32.680]  printing money and then this great uni power will
[3:38:32.680 --> 3:38:36.040]  disappear off the face of the earth really quick
[3:38:36.040 --> 3:38:39.960]  people have no idea how vulnerable we are you know the united states trade
[3:38:39.960 --> 3:38:45.080]  deficit is larger than the combined trade
[3:38:45.080 --> 3:38:47.880]  deficits of every other country in the world
[3:38:47.880 --> 3:38:51.080]  that's indebted to this
[3:38:52.280 --> 3:38:56.040]  this is extraordinary our budget deficit is larger
[3:38:56.040 --> 3:38:59.480]  but the the annual budget deficit for government
[3:38:59.480 --> 3:39:02.840]  than the combined budget deficit of every other country in the world okay let me
[3:39:02.840 --> 3:39:07.160]  ask you this question where Alex we finance these by foreigners lending us
[3:39:07.160 --> 3:39:10.840]  the money and then there's no industry to buy the
[3:39:10.840 --> 3:39:14.520]  to have the money to buy goods anymore so it's going to cause a worldwide
[3:39:14.520 --> 3:39:17.720]  problem isn't it nothing to sell we got nothing to sell
[3:39:17.720 --> 3:39:22.440]  to close the trade debt and now that they've run up the oil price so much
[3:39:22.440 --> 3:39:27.720]  the trade deficit must be somewhere over a trillion dollars
[3:39:27.720 --> 3:39:30.840]  i mean it was it was seven eight hundred billion
[3:39:30.840 --> 3:39:35.080]  back when the oil price was what thirty dollars
[3:39:35.080 --> 3:39:40.520]  let me ask you this hundred thirty it's got to be the trade deficit must be
[3:39:40.520 --> 3:39:44.760]  somewhere around a trillion dollars and the only way we pay for that is by
[3:39:44.760 --> 3:39:48.600]  turning over the ownership of our existing assets
[3:39:48.600 --> 3:39:51.880]  and that's happening now that's been happening so now we're going to start
[3:39:51.880 --> 3:39:55.080]  giving them instead of giving them seven eight hundred billion dollars a year of
[3:39:55.080 --> 3:39:58.840]  what we have we can give them a trillion dollars that's our companies
[3:39:58.840 --> 3:40:03.240]  you know the all the natural resources
[3:40:03.240 --> 3:40:09.240]  we selling the toll roads to them so they get the revenues from toll roads
[3:40:09.240 --> 3:40:15.320]  the real estate anything we can offer them how long until all that runs out
[3:40:15.320 --> 3:40:19.560]  uh... it wouldn't last very long your trillion dollars a year runs through
[3:40:19.560 --> 3:40:23.960]  wealth pretty fast even for a company a country that's
[3:40:23.960 --> 3:40:28.120]  you know been successful and and accumulated so this brings a new meaning
[3:40:28.120 --> 3:40:33.000]  to the word looted looted yeah we look we've
[3:40:33.000 --> 3:40:35.960]  we thought we were so smart we're looting the world
[3:40:35.960 --> 3:40:39.960]  getting all their goods getting them to finance us and handing the paper
[3:40:39.960 --> 3:40:43.560]  but the paper comes back and buys up our assets
[3:40:43.560 --> 3:40:47.400]  until the only question is will the paper collapse
[3:40:47.400 --> 3:40:50.440]  completely before they can buy it all up in a way that might be good
[3:40:50.440 --> 3:40:54.440]  uh... last question we're going to calls they are announcing
[3:40:54.440 --> 3:40:58.200]  and it's in the housing bill and i've got the bill right here we had ron paul on
[3:40:58.200 --> 3:41:01.880]  about it today that every credit card transaction will instantly be uploaded
[3:41:01.880 --> 3:41:06.600]  the irs major gas companies uh... a bc news reports
[3:41:06.600 --> 3:41:09.480]  are going to make you registered with a credit card to be able to buy gas to
[3:41:09.480 --> 3:41:10.840]  track everything you're doing
[3:41:10.840 --> 3:41:14.040]  they're hiring more police more checkpoints more tickets
[3:41:14.040 --> 3:41:19.000]  every american newborn baby will be visited by cps that bill is about to
[3:41:19.000 --> 3:41:22.760]  pass uh... turning carbon taxes harassment
[3:41:22.760 --> 3:41:25.640]  government is just as you know tripled in the last eight years
[3:41:25.640 --> 3:41:29.080]  it's just seems to be about to divide again and get even bigger
[3:41:29.080 --> 3:41:35.000]  like a bacterial infection uh... and they just seem to just giggle and laugh and
[3:41:35.000 --> 3:41:39.000]  put black uniforms on and wave tasers at us and put up more cameras and
[3:41:39.000 --> 3:41:43.880]  just tackle and put skulls on the sides of police armored vehicles and
[3:41:43.880 --> 3:41:48.440]  i mean it's just it's it seems like total mental meltdown
[3:41:48.440 --> 3:41:51.240]  it appears like when cancers racing to the body
[3:41:51.240 --> 3:41:54.280]  right before death i mean is that what you see this is what's going to happen
[3:41:54.280 --> 3:41:56.920]  to all the thugs and all the scum and all the
[3:41:56.920 --> 3:42:02.040]  uh... i mean it's not only that badges they'll all have badges
[3:42:02.040 --> 3:42:06.840]  but you know there's no reason for any of this to happen and we certainly don't
[3:42:06.840 --> 3:42:09.240]  have any money to pay for it
[3:42:09.240 --> 3:42:12.440]  and the chinese aren't going to keep them all this money either
[3:42:12.440 --> 3:42:15.960]  you know i just don't know it if it's really going to be something like that
[3:42:15.960 --> 3:42:19.960]  i think people should just leave the country
[3:42:19.960 --> 3:42:23.160]  they should just get out well that's what your book is about i mean what is it
[3:42:23.160 --> 3:42:28.280]  now i mean what what are they making i mean that's what they're setting up
[3:42:28.280 --> 3:42:33.480]  well what what is the point of this uh... credit card business and and all of
[3:42:33.480 --> 3:42:36.040]  the purchases going to the government and
[3:42:36.040 --> 3:42:41.800]  in visiting every child is born by child protect what is the point of all
[3:42:41.800 --> 3:42:44.760]  it would be i mean what purpose does that
[3:42:44.760 --> 3:42:49.720]  serve total control just to intimidate people
[3:42:49.720 --> 3:42:53.400]  well then then what they'll do is they'll
[3:42:53.400 --> 3:42:57.720]  alienate everyone from the government i don't know if that's what i'm not
[3:42:57.720 --> 3:43:01.320]  that's what i'm saying it's it's like
[3:43:01.320 --> 3:43:04.840]  well i i've got an abc news report we don't have time to play it today

[3:44:11.400 --> 3:44:18.680]  um but well those kinds of occupations police airport security any
[3:44:18.680 --> 3:44:23.480]  that stuff attract uh social path peon social
[3:44:23.480 --> 3:44:27.640]  them bugs they don't attract good people
[3:44:27.640 --> 3:44:31.000]  attract people that want to abuse people but they ain't got
[3:44:31.000 --> 3:44:35.880]  enough guts to go join the marines and actually have to go someone get shot
[3:44:35.880 --> 3:44:39.720]  back at so they like to have power where
[3:44:39.720 --> 3:44:44.040]  where their victims of power so they're cowards
[3:44:44.040 --> 3:44:48.520]  they know it all bullies are cowards
[3:44:48.520 --> 3:44:52.200]  and so it's this massive bureaucracy that protects them
[3:44:52.200 --> 3:44:58.600]  oh and uh so that's the kind of people that take those jobs when you
[3:44:58.600 --> 3:45:03.880]  create those kind of jobs you're creating homes places
[3:45:03.880 --> 3:45:08.200]  form it for those kinds of people yeah it's but it's incredible john do you have
[3:45:08.200 --> 3:45:11.320]  that queued up yet i have the power comment

[3:46:06.360 --> 3:46:09.240]  saying that they're done with all this
[3:46:09.240 --> 3:46:13.000]  all right yeah i think they're done with us but they're the rising powers
[3:46:13.000 --> 3:46:16.040]  yeah they don't think they don't need to act like a bunch it'll happen in our
[3:46:16.040 --> 3:46:18.840]  lifetime george and indiana you're on the air with

[3:46:31.320 --> 3:46:35.160]  me a fish sandwich and on the drive-thru window now it says no video
[3:46:35.160 --> 3:46:38.760]  filming or picture taking i'm going to tell that manager i'm never
[3:46:38.760 --> 3:46:41.800]  eating there again to let comes down well i want to explain they're going to
[3:46:41.800 --> 3:46:46.120]  surveil us but then we can't surveil them back and i've got tons of videos of
[3:46:46.120 --> 3:46:50.440]  cops walking up on city streets telling people don't take camp shots again it's
[3:46:50.440 --> 3:46:52.840]  just more martial law what's the other comment
[3:46:52.840 --> 3:46:56.600]  absolutely all right on the on this guy that thinks he follows the christian
[3:46:56.600 --> 3:47:00.680]  attitude uh second commandment says make no image of heaven or earth or bound
[3:47:00.680 --> 3:47:02.760]  down to it you see crosses everywhere
[3:47:02.760 --> 3:47:05.000]  these people don't understand what they're worshiping
[3:47:05.000 --> 3:47:08.360]  in florida this again says he is jesus and the antichrist
[3:47:08.360 --> 3:47:11.320]  put the six six six on people and they're following her here do you have any
[3:47:11.320 --> 3:47:14.840]  questions for dr roberts because that's why we open the phones up
[3:47:14.840 --> 3:47:19.400]  oh no uh another thing our our government is not a department of
[3:47:19.400 --> 3:47:23.160]  offense the department of defense we shouldn't be attacking people
[3:47:23.160 --> 3:47:26.280]  with no provocation what i want to ask you guys though
[3:47:26.280 --> 3:47:30.760]  is uh explain to everybody out there what it means what when it says that
[3:47:30.760 --> 3:47:34.440]  those are with israel god is with them those are against israel
[3:47:34.440 --> 3:47:37.720]  god is against them explain what that really means well i mean it's not in the
[3:47:37.720 --> 3:47:40.920]  bible uh the prophets were coming and saying when israel was bad and was
[3:47:40.920 --> 3:47:44.600]  going to go into exile it's just made up and it makes the christian religion
[3:47:44.600 --> 3:47:51.160]  now is real worship dr roberts i think you nailed it
[3:47:51.160 --> 3:47:54.600]  i mean i agree with you alex it's just mindless cold worship i mean it's it's
[3:47:54.600 --> 3:47:58.120]  insane and israel doesn't like the christian faith in the
[3:47:58.120 --> 3:48:00.920]  government so they have hagi say jesus is is not
[3:48:00.920 --> 3:48:04.600]  jesus i mean and they say all right he's bad i mean you know these people do
[3:48:04.600 --> 3:48:08.280]  anything they're told folks i mean that hagi could dress up in a devil outfit
[3:48:08.280 --> 3:48:11.240]  and say you know have anton levain and they bow down
[3:48:11.240 --> 3:48:14.840]  uh who's up next george or steve here
[3:48:14.840 --> 3:48:18.200]  steve in ohio you're on the air go ahead with dr roberts any economic
[3:48:18.200 --> 3:48:21.320]  questions hey how's it going alex mr roberts
[3:48:21.320 --> 3:48:25.560]  um i got a question that did you guys see that speech by george bush that he
[3:48:25.560 --> 3:48:29.080]  may address the exactly addressing the nation and he came more or less than
[3:48:29.080 --> 3:48:33.720]  form form just that uh our country was it going to be the industrial power that
[3:48:33.720 --> 3:48:38.040]  it used to be we were going to work we're uh we're moving toward uh data
[3:48:38.040 --> 3:48:41.800]  processing and service oriented industries
[3:48:41.800 --> 3:48:46.120]  you guys remember seeing that yes that's what we see now right
[3:48:46.120 --> 3:48:49.400]  we see the uh the destruction of the you know manufacturing and
[3:48:49.400 --> 3:48:52.680]  all these large corporations in this country disappear and it didn't happen
[3:48:52.680 --> 3:48:55.720]  by accident dr roberts you know thinks that they just
[3:48:55.720 --> 3:48:58.520]  are a bunch of idiots and i agree they are delusional but but they're
[3:48:58.520 --> 3:49:02.760]  engineering this i mean they know what they're doing don't they dr roberts
[3:49:02.760 --> 3:49:06.280]  it's not just manufacturing jobs either it's uh
[3:49:06.280 --> 3:49:11.080]  it's all the data processing jobs all the computer software jobs
[3:49:11.080 --> 3:49:14.920]  it's any uh job that's tradable that is
[3:49:14.920 --> 3:49:19.880]  that doesn't have to be done hands-on like the bar bar or dinner yet or
[3:49:19.880 --> 3:49:23.880]  awaiting a table or fixing a drink you don't make a living in town service
[3:49:23.880 --> 3:49:27.720]  can be all short and the reason they're doing it
[3:49:27.720 --> 3:49:33.720]  is because it dramatically lowers their cost of production
[3:49:33.720 --> 3:49:41.080]  and they then can pay themselves a multi-million dollar performance pay
[3:49:41.080 --> 3:49:46.200]  okay it's a short-term thing for them but does destroy the goose that lays the
[3:49:46.200 --> 3:49:50.680]  golden axe when china when china calls in their loans to us
[3:49:50.680 --> 3:49:53.880]  why happens when they stop taking american dollars
[3:49:53.880 --> 3:49:57.880]  yeah the government can't pay its bills any longer
[3:49:57.880 --> 3:50:02.440]  the u.s government can't pay its bills if the chinese
[3:50:02.440 --> 3:50:07.160]  don't buy its paper and that's why they're setting up work brigades and the
[3:50:07.160 --> 3:50:11.160]  million-man youth corps the did you see obama dr roberts
[3:50:11.160 --> 3:50:15.320]  say that he wants a million-man teenagers spying on the american people last
[3:50:15.320 --> 3:50:21.240]  week i didn't see that well then he's just now part of the problem
[3:50:21.240 --> 3:50:25.560]  isn't he i mean all this stuff about change it sounds like the only change
[3:50:25.560 --> 3:50:29.720]  he's gonna bring is for the worse well now he's
[3:50:29.720 --> 3:50:33.240]  out talking the line of warmongering that just i mean we know he's handled by
[3:50:33.240 --> 3:50:38.600]  the same crew that's right i totally agree it's the
[3:50:38.600 --> 3:50:42.920]  same crew and what we mustn't overlook though
[3:50:42.920 --> 3:50:47.720]  is they're not the united states is no longer the powerhouse that they think it
[3:50:47.720 --> 3:50:51.400]  is well like you said this isn't like a man who
[3:50:51.400 --> 3:50:54.920]  beats his wife every night with a tire iron and she's finally leaving
[3:50:54.920 --> 3:50:58.440]  and he and and and you know he really tries to intimidate her when she's got
[3:50:58.440 --> 3:51:01.960]  everything loaded up and he pulls a gun out and threatens to shoot her i mean i
[3:51:01.960 --> 3:51:05.640]  think we've gotten to that point would you agree with that analogy
[3:51:05.640 --> 3:51:11.160]  well if we pull a gun on china russia we're gonna get our clocks clean
[3:51:11.160 --> 3:51:14.280]  so i of course that's what mccain wants to do
[3:51:14.280 --> 3:51:19.720]  apparently mccain has the body language of a lunatic would you agree with that
[3:51:19.720 --> 3:51:22.200]  i mean he acts like i mean if i knew that guy in
[3:51:22.200 --> 3:51:25.240]  business i would i would think he had a screw loose i think they call it
[3:51:25.240 --> 3:51:31.560]  testosterone poisoning i think that's the psychological term for
[3:51:31.560 --> 3:51:36.040]  mccain just testosterone poisoning
[3:51:38.600 --> 3:51:42.840]  yeah he's definitely got a screw loose thank you steve uh Todd in Ohio you're
[3:51:42.840 --> 3:51:45.640]  on the air
[3:51:47.240 --> 3:51:51.640]  go ahead Todd hey how's it going i just wanted to call in and make the point
[3:51:51.640 --> 3:51:55.400]  uh it's funny how the people that are saying that you should follow the
[3:51:55.400 --> 3:51:58.280]  government do whatever they say they say follow those laws
[3:51:58.280 --> 3:52:02.360]  or the same ones that actually reject the laws of god but they say you got to
[3:52:02.360 --> 3:52:05.240]  follow man's laws that don't follow god's laws
[3:52:05.240 --> 3:52:07.960]  does that make any sense no no that's right they're the funny christians that
[3:52:07.960 --> 3:52:11.400]  go out and have abortions and get you know get divorced five or six
[3:52:11.400 --> 3:52:13.720]  times and i'm not even judging those people the point is
[3:52:13.720 --> 3:52:17.160]  they're the ones that do that and they're the ones that'll steal from you in
[3:52:17.160 --> 3:52:19.560]  business i mean i grew up around a bunch of big dallas preachers in the
[3:52:19.560 --> 3:52:22.440]  neighborhood i lived in you know upper middle class my dad
[3:52:22.440 --> 3:52:26.680]  my and uh and i saw him partying and i saw him with the hookers next door and i
[3:52:26.680 --> 3:52:29.880]  saw him with all that and i'd see him on tv the next you know the next day on
[3:52:29.880 --> 3:52:35.000]  sunday on dallas television dr robert you're giggling
[3:52:35.560 --> 3:52:41.160]  yeah well listen i think on the whole
[3:52:41.160 --> 3:52:46.360]  the question is open whether or not there is a christian religion maybe there's
[3:52:46.360 --> 3:52:50.040]  still something left in the catholic church i think the prophet churches
[3:52:50.040 --> 3:52:55.560]  have blown it by the catholics you mean at least they're still against abortion
[3:52:55.560 --> 3:52:58.840]  well i think they still believe that people have
[3:52:58.840 --> 3:53:04.200]  souls and that the purpose of religion is to save a soul
[3:53:04.200 --> 3:53:07.800]  and i guess the church has been against the war too so that's a
[3:53:07.800 --> 3:53:13.000]  generally they are against destruction of human life whether it's war abortion
[3:53:13.000 --> 3:53:19.000]  uh capital punishment and they think life is something god gives
[3:53:19.000 --> 3:53:23.320]  be so squandrous of it yeah okay let's uh go we're into the final
[3:53:23.320 --> 3:53:27.480]  last few minutes now uh here ladies and gentlemen john do you
[3:53:27.480 --> 3:53:31.240]  we're able to find that little sub clip of that abc news piece where they're
[3:53:31.240 --> 3:53:34.920]  going after the world war two vets and the 15 year old girls uh and then
[3:53:34.920 --> 3:53:38.360]  speeding their chest screaming i have power i have power did you find that
[3:53:38.360 --> 3:53:43.080]  he's ready oh let's go ahead and play this from abc news
[3:53:43.080 --> 3:53:46.760]  so i took the belt up he ran his hands down over and pulled the pants down they
[3:53:46.760 --> 3:53:50.760]  went down around my ankles at that point perry was standing in his
[3:53:50.760 --> 3:53:54.600]  underwear in public view he has to see a supervisor
[3:53:54.600 --> 3:53:59.000]  that made things worse she was yelling i have power
[3:53:59.000 --> 3:54:04.040]  i have power i have power the power to stop him from flying to florida with
[3:54:04.040 --> 3:54:08.200]  his wife that day to celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary
[3:54:08.200 --> 3:54:14.120]  make you feel like you you have no rights perry says he always alerts tsa agents
[3:54:14.120 --> 3:54:18.120]  about his metal knee and wonders why they can't just check his leg
[3:54:18.120 --> 3:54:21.800]  if somebody told me that i that i'm going to save the people on the airplane
[3:54:21.800 --> 3:54:25.560]  but by taking my pants off on public uh on there
[3:54:25.560 --> 3:54:30.680]  i wouldn't mind doing it but this was not necessary tsa officials say that when
[3:54:30.680 --> 3:54:35.560]  the metal detector goes off their agents must resolve what was the alarm
[3:54:35.560 --> 3:54:39.400]  dr roberts we know this is by design i mean they want to train us how to be
[3:54:39.400 --> 3:54:42.920]  slaves as you've said and people need to know that now they have the body
[3:54:42.920 --> 3:54:45.400]  scanners with a videotape your neck and body
[3:54:45.400 --> 3:54:48.520]  and i'm i'm not going through those and and uh
[3:54:48.520 --> 3:54:51.720]  you know you watch that same video where they beat people up for just
[3:54:51.720 --> 3:54:54.840]  not even rudely talking back and now they're killing people
[3:54:54.840 --> 3:54:59.720]  and they behind closed doors at airports i mean where's it gonna end
[3:54:59.720 --> 3:55:05.240]  well um when we stop being cheap you know
[3:55:05.240 --> 3:55:08.920]  this guy right around i have power somebody should have decked him in fact
[3:55:08.920 --> 3:55:13.000]  all the people there all there must have been hundreds of people waiting in
[3:55:13.000 --> 3:55:15.960]  those stupid lines they should have attacked
[3:55:15.960 --> 3:55:19.960]  those transportation security people in mass and just beat the leverage
[3:55:19.960 --> 3:55:23.720]  shut out of them that's what
[3:55:24.360 --> 3:55:28.040]  oh my god one that's exactly what they should
[3:55:28.040 --> 3:55:31.800]  if they all pull these people and they ought to strip them all
[3:55:31.800 --> 3:55:35.160]  or get them out of the building next
[3:55:35.160 --> 3:55:38.600]  when the cops come they ought to turn over their cars and do the same thing to
[3:55:38.600 --> 3:55:41.320]  them well you know the chinese are people start
[3:55:41.320 --> 3:55:44.360]  standing up themselves realize that they're dealing with a bunch of
[3:55:44.360 --> 3:55:48.440]  fascist thugs well you know the communist chinese their
[3:55:48.440 --> 3:55:51.720]  population is revolting and taking over cities every week
[3:55:51.720 --> 3:55:54.600]  and they try to cover it up in the news but the chinese have a lot more spirit
[3:55:54.600 --> 3:55:59.560]  than we do and less to revolt about
[3:55:59.560 --> 3:56:02.520]  well that's true in fact it was in the article and they put cameras up the
[3:56:02.520 --> 3:56:06.920]  chinese climb up and knock them down and throw fits
[3:56:06.920 --> 3:56:09.880]  i mean when communist china in many respects is more free than we are we're
[3:56:09.880 --> 3:56:12.760]  in a lot trouble i i agree that they are
[3:56:12.760 --> 3:56:16.760]  yes they definitely are more free than we are i've been there
[3:56:16.760 --> 3:56:21.000]  recently definitely they don't have the sphere
[3:56:21.000 --> 3:56:24.120]  of government and the government's trying not trying to instill
