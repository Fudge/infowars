[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:31.920]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones welcome to
[00:31.920 --> 00:36.800]  the Alex Jones show I've got Alex in the studio with me I'm David Knight filling in the rest of
[00:36.800 --> 00:41.560]  the show but Alex is joining us today to talk about the Hunger Games and to talk about the
[00:41.560 --> 00:46.120]  burgeoning police state you know it's one thing we talk about that all the time we see it happening
[00:46.120 --> 00:49.920]  all over the country it's one thing to talk about it it's one thing to understand it it's
[00:49.920 --> 00:54.040]  another thing to experience it firsthand and that's exactly what Alex and mostly in for
[00:54.040 --> 00:58.920]  wars crew did last week I was watching it here live in the studio it was pretty amazing but
[00:58.920 --> 01:03.920]  even then it's not the same as being in the middle of it is it Alex that's right folks and again
[01:03.920 --> 01:12.080]  it is Tuesday the 26th day of November 2013 and as usual wild horses cannot drag me away I had
[01:12.080 --> 01:16.400]  more stuff I had to do today but I am going to go home early today and I've actually got my
[01:16.400 --> 01:21.520]  children up here with me today at the office so we're getting you know some other things finished
[01:21.520 --> 01:28.640]  working on the Obama deception to working on the nightly news finishing up some work on the
[01:28.640 --> 01:36.960]  new studio really a busy operation here in the fight for liberty but I thought while I'm here
[01:38.720 --> 01:44.480]  why not give folks my review of the Hunger Games I know it's been out since last Friday but I went
[01:44.480 --> 01:52.320]  and I saw it last night and have some reflections on that coming up in the next segment that I will
[01:52.320 --> 01:58.880]  then tie into some of the police state news just that we see locally here in Austin Texas
[01:59.520 --> 02:05.920]  and outside Austin Texas where according to the cell phone video a young man saw two girls
[02:05.920 --> 02:11.840]  fighting so he was walked up with standing there and then was walking away and had done nothing
[02:11.840 --> 02:18.880]  and he wasn't a troubled student he was a good student and they tasered him in the back in Bastrop
[02:18.880 --> 02:27.600]  a Mr. Rivera 17 year old young man and he fell over bashed up in his head and is in a coma
[02:27.600 --> 02:32.720]  and they believe he's going to die if they take him off life support so I just wanted to point
[02:32.720 --> 02:38.560]  that out that the police are militarized they have been trained that were the enemy the conversion
[02:38.560 --> 02:43.920]  over to this system is almost complete and we are living in the Hunger Games and it really clicked
[02:43.920 --> 02:54.240]  when I saw the film that my goodness we're already living in this and this is agenda 21 this group
[02:54.240 --> 03:02.480]  of books and what is in the film is literally the neo feudalist system where we're underserved them
[03:03.120 --> 03:09.440]  in a post-industrial world living at starvation levels with a ration card and if we go above our
[03:09.440 --> 03:15.840]  calories were killed that's literally the books and then there's high tech mega cities with
[03:17.840 --> 03:23.920]  super advanced nano tech you name it that is actually in the plans going back to the 20s
[03:24.560 --> 03:30.640]  with Huxley and his brother and all of the top eugenicists this is really their plan
[03:31.200 --> 03:35.520]  and they're really deploying it so I'm going to talk about that when we come back plus we have a
[03:35.520 --> 03:44.000]  special new radio slash tv intro Darren Mcbrane is just an amazing editor and also a great reporter
[03:44.000 --> 03:48.800]  and so I kind of quasi directed this piece with him and it's a nice little three minute intro
[03:48.800 --> 03:55.680]  that's only a small section of how serious the police state is so if a police state came would
[03:55.680 --> 04:01.280]  we notice it well some of us have and then we of course are the heretics were criticized and in
[04:01.280 --> 04:06.000]  most authoritarian societies they admit you're under an authoritarian society it's just implicit
[04:06.560 --> 04:11.200]  here it's this no man's land where those of us that are not completely brain dead know we're in
[04:11.200 --> 04:17.200]  deep trouble it's in the rest of the public are in denial but that denial is rapidly boiling away
[04:17.200 --> 04:21.920]  and so now they're taking the velvet glove off the iron fist also up on info wars.com for some
[04:21.920 --> 04:26.160]  reason we didn't post it to the youtube channel yesterday but it was on prisonplanet.tv and
[04:26.160 --> 04:31.520]  premiered on the radio we have the Vivian Kubrick impromptu on the street interview
[04:32.320 --> 04:36.480]  that Josh Owens did a great job putting together and editing and we're going to have a more
[04:36.480 --> 04:40.080]  focused boil down to that coming up the next few days in the nightly news because I know you're
[04:40.080 --> 04:43.920]  a big Kubrick fan so David Knight's going to be hosting the whole show with a bunch of special

[05:12.720 --> 05:18.720]  fluoride ladies and gentlemen alex jones here in 1924 the federal government did the right thing
[05:18.720 --> 05:25.280]  and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic table and the
[05:25.280 --> 05:31.920]  results are on record reports documented a 15 point iq increase in areas that had previously
[05:31.920 --> 05:38.640]  been deficient in iodine bottom line iodine is important unbound clean in a glycerin base

[07:08.640 --> 07:13.600]  known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the united states and across

[09:10.640 --> 09:15.520]  government with potentially their biggest problem us so part of it is we have to break
[09:15.520 --> 09:20.240]  through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families
[09:20.240 --> 09:24.720]  and recognize that kids belong to whole communities if you've got a business that you didn't build
[09:24.720 --> 09:31.520]  that somebody else made that happen mercury containing vaccines may help not harm kids
[09:31.520 --> 09:36.560]  according to two new studies in the journal pediatrics blackhawk choppers soaring through the

[09:58.560 --> 10:03.120]  i am in my apartment sir i am inside i have two words for you
[10:03.120 --> 10:16.000]  the dramatic scene played out in front of our cameras parents grabbing their children and running
[10:16.000 --> 10:20.000]  after spending the night hunkering in their houses and then finding themselves face to
[10:20.000 --> 10:24.240]  face with the muzzle of a swat officer's rifle they let them in the area they told them they
[10:24.240 --> 10:37.200]  could come in and now they're coming in like they're trespassers punching and shoving people

[11:14.800 --> 11:20.240]  jones that was an amazing new intro put together by the people that are working on the documentary
[11:20.240 --> 11:24.240]  that's a sample of what's going to be coming up in this documentary darin Mcbrain and others
[11:24.240 --> 11:30.480]  put that together that's a great segment alex well i i wanted to actually the last few weeks
[11:30.480 --> 11:34.720]  been working on some new intros and that's just one of them for the radio slash tv show and the
[11:34.720 --> 11:41.520]  nightly news just to illustrate on different subjects a small snippet of what we're really
[11:41.520 --> 11:49.200]  facing what we're really dealing with and i wanted to segue with that because i want to
[11:49.200 --> 11:55.520]  give folks my review of the hunger games and then tie it in to the things that are currently
[11:55.520 --> 12:00.400]  happening in our world today and then i'm going to leave you at the end of this segment and you've
[12:00.400 --> 12:06.800]  got a bunch of guests coming up and a ton of really important news but i will be popping in tomorrow
[12:06.800 --> 12:12.880]  but then again on friday with you we're running a rebroadcast obviously on thanksgiving on thursday
[12:13.360 --> 12:18.960]  and i think i'm going to go out thursday night and friday and cover maybe with some live feeds
[12:19.760 --> 12:25.840]  maybe i'll go out and report for you from the street friday with some live feeds of the black
[12:25.840 --> 12:30.640]  friday madness because that's always a great illustration of the stampeding and rioting
[12:30.640 --> 12:35.440]  and things that happen so we'll have that for folks on friday into the weekend as well but we're
[12:35.440 --> 12:42.480]  live it is uh tuesday the 26th day of november 2013 and i'm your host and you're co-hosting
[12:42.480 --> 12:48.880]  with the hosts of m4's nightly news and of course that is david night now we just show people a small
[12:50.080 --> 12:56.240]  cross section of all over the country the military is rolling out preparing for war
[12:56.240 --> 13:02.080]  not with al-qaeda but with the tea party with gun owners with veterans with christians they
[13:02.080 --> 13:07.120]  have the irs they have the other agencies persecuting them illegally we have the president on at least
[13:07.120 --> 13:14.480]  eight different fields from war to energy to open borders to obama care the list goes on and on to
[13:14.480 --> 13:19.760]  federal appointments operating completely outside of congress and saying he doesn't need congress
[13:19.760 --> 13:26.480]  this has never happened except under total martial law with abraham lincoln this has never happened
[13:26.480 --> 13:34.240]  and i have to say that was on the war he acted a dictatorial not on all other issues so obama is
[13:34.240 --> 13:39.360]  officially by every yardstick on a scale of one to ten a ten being a total maximum dictator at
[13:39.360 --> 13:48.000]  off hitler uh saddam hussein obama is about a seven now uh and and the persecution is going on and
[13:48.000 --> 13:52.400]  the arms buildup is going on and well he set up the entire infrastructure i mean just because he
[13:52.400 --> 13:56.720]  hasn't started shooting people in streets or rounding them up and putting them in prison camps
[13:56.720 --> 14:01.840]  that doesn't mean that the others were talking about the seven on the scale of uh one to ten
[14:01.840 --> 14:06.720]  he set up the infrastructure for tyranny and just as they had in this video he started it and he
[14:06.720 --> 14:11.280]  ended it with a military industrial complex speech by eisenhower because that's what's driving this
[14:11.280 --> 14:17.040]  is the accumulation of weaponry absolutely and and you know directing that that little intro that's
[14:17.040 --> 14:23.120]  only a smidgen of the stuff i could have put in there we could have an hour long intro just showing
[14:23.120 --> 14:29.440]  more craziness on top of more insanity because it's not crazy it is the cold calculated
[14:30.480 --> 14:37.520]  takeover of society so what i'm explaining to people here is in nazi germany uh in the first
[14:37.520 --> 14:42.560]  decade of the soviet union or or the bolshevik takeover for the formation of the soviet union
[14:42.560 --> 14:49.280]  that's how it began was bureaucratic persecution and tax persecution that's how what hitler did
[14:49.280 --> 14:53.440]  with the jews and others was you know messing with their businesses not letting them operate
[14:53.440 --> 15:00.480]  right auditing them uh sending cps to take their kids this is already going on and the cps manuals
[15:00.480 --> 15:06.240]  demonize homeschoolers we would have abc news and others come up of the associated press as well
[15:06.240 --> 15:10.560]  and would say to our you know folks that wrapped are demonstrating in dallas on wednesday thursday
[15:10.560 --> 15:16.960]  friday and saturday they'd say are you a homeschooler do you own guns and and and these these reporters
[15:16.960 --> 15:24.240]  the ones that are left inside the system were absolutely animated with demoniac glow this one
[15:24.240 --> 15:27.520]  woman that was talking to good she already i walked over and she turned on me and was like
[15:28.240 --> 15:34.160]  smiling with hate and i mean these are actual operatives folks have to understand now who's
[15:34.160 --> 15:39.200]  left in the system are either people that are total mercenaries and hate their job and i talked to some
[15:39.200 --> 15:44.160]  of those high level and mid level and low level i mean dallas morning news writer came up in my
[15:44.160 --> 15:47.680]  hotel and she goes oh my dad's a huge listener i want a photo for him yeah i'm here to write this
[15:47.680 --> 15:51.200]  piece i don't i don't i don't i just it's so great what you're doing and then the piece comes out
[15:51.200 --> 15:58.400]  and it's a negative hit piece so that's the type of stuff that goes on because they will not let it
[15:58.400 --> 16:02.320]  get out the dallas morning news by the way is highly controlled my mother worked there for many years
[16:02.320 --> 16:06.080]  oh yeah and i'm not going to get into that but the whole point is i could see that from the story
[16:06.080 --> 16:11.440]  that they put out a bunch of them and they were all literal twisted fictions mixed in with some
[16:11.440 --> 16:16.640]  truths now in the time we've got left here i want to get into all this news and talk about
[16:16.640 --> 16:24.160]  the hunger games in context i went to the hunger games last night with my wife and the first one
[16:24.160 --> 16:29.840]  was pretty good the second one had unbelievable cinematography uh just the scenes driving in
[16:29.840 --> 16:35.200]  the train the scenes of the sports stadiums the way they can i mean i've this this was delicious
[16:35.200 --> 16:43.440]  to the eye this film was delicious to the eye you've seen it as well on friday and but looking at it
[16:43.440 --> 16:50.240]  you see this is all coming true this is all happening this is actually the agenda 21 exact plan
[16:50.240 --> 16:56.000]  this woman who wrote it is either a total patriot uh and aware of what's going on and super smart
[16:56.000 --> 17:00.000]  or she's a total operative and we tried to contact her many times obviously she hasn't gotten back
[17:00.000 --> 17:04.320]  with us because publishers and folks don't let somebody that big using new interviews they try
[17:04.320 --> 17:10.480]  to tie him down but who knows you she might be a listener like vivian cubrick and her
[17:10.480 --> 17:14.320]  interview is now up on info wars dot com for folks that want to see it from yesterday if you're
[17:14.320 --> 17:21.840]  a radio listener but looking at this this is the dream this is the greatest approximation
[17:22.400 --> 17:27.680]  of the competing eugenesis transhumanist programs that were launched in the 1850s
[17:27.680 --> 17:34.800]  officially going into transhumanism and post human model uh by the 1920s with this advanced
[17:34.800 --> 17:47.200]  breakaway technocracy above a feudal surf system with literal floating fortresses uh with peacekeepers
[17:47.200 --> 17:52.960]  coming down out of the sky in fact uh i read uh the book things to come and then he made it into a
[17:52.960 --> 17:58.320]  film uh what was the name of the hg wells film that came out in the in the 20s it was things to come
[17:58.320 --> 18:02.720]  that's right things to come book was or the novel shape of things to come exactly but in that it's a
[18:02.720 --> 18:08.720]  un world government bombing the the old uh you know countries that don't want to be part of it
[18:08.720 --> 18:14.640]  they end the family uh un peacekeepers come down out of giant what looks like batwing fighters
[18:14.640 --> 18:22.240]  b2 bombers and then i watch this it's giant batwing b2 bombers i i mean literally that's how
[18:22.240 --> 18:28.400]  smart the new order is hd wells wrote a book and made a film that even by today's standards is is
[18:28.400 --> 18:33.120]  incredibly high quality uh yeah there it is things to come that that everybody should watch it's free
[18:33.120 --> 18:37.600]  online on youtube yes uh in fact one of our film contests entrance actually did one uh
[18:37.600 --> 18:44.160]  paralleling at 2021 that's why you watch this this is a repeat of them shaping the mind
[18:45.280 --> 18:50.720]  preparing everyone now i'll give her the benefit of the doubt and say well you know hunger games
[18:50.720 --> 18:56.560]  catching fire just like bane wants you to have a revolution and says fire goes up it's the same
[18:56.560 --> 19:02.800]  thing they're trying to invoke a false revolution in a dialectic this is on record of the pressure
[19:02.800 --> 19:08.400]  they've created and here's peter southerland here's peter southerland in the guardian last week
[19:09.120 --> 19:14.000]  donald southerland always say peter southerland donald southerland saying i want hunger games
[19:14.000 --> 19:19.600]  to stir up a revolution but what revolution does he want against capitalism he says in here
[19:19.600 --> 19:24.960]  mm-hmm and uh you know that he's a left-wing socialist now i like donald southerland
[19:26.400 --> 19:32.400]  also like peter the late peter southerland uh but the point is uh is that i like we're gonna come
[19:32.400 --> 19:39.520]  back and i'm gonna break this down but the issue here is that they have created the crisis this is
[19:39.520 --> 19:45.600]  socialism we're seeing with fascism on top now their answer will be more of this and so they're
[19:45.600 --> 19:52.080]  saying they hope to cause a leftist revolution with this film and others so that's why it looks like
[19:52.080 --> 19:57.120]  it's anti-establishment because the establishment is so sophisticated they have to steal our energy
[19:57.120 --> 20:02.400]  well they're right back with david nine on alex shows alex jones here and i want to tell you

[24:11.600 --> 24:16.320]  welcome back to the alex joneshow i'm joined here in studio with alex jones i'm david knight and
[24:16.320 --> 24:22.400]  we were just talking about the hunger games and how it is either predictive programming for agenda
[24:22.400 --> 24:27.360]  21 or it's trying to wake people up what do you think alex well i don't want to say that the writer
[24:27.360 --> 24:33.920]  of it's a bad person i don't know but this is the deepest dream of the new world order but with the
[24:33.920 --> 24:39.760]  hg wells film and book things to come uh it was put out as positive this is putting it out as
[24:39.760 --> 24:45.440]  negative but you see what they're doing is they're saying the answer is rebel against this bring in
[24:45.440 --> 24:51.600]  socialism and communism and that's the message as well we've got now more than half the economy
[24:51.600 --> 24:56.800]  going to socialism and redistribution and the ultra rich are offshore and are exempt and they're
[24:56.800 --> 25:01.520]  the ones promoting this agenda why is that because it gives them a controlled economy what they lost
[25:01.520 --> 25:07.200]  after what they want they're the ones creating this hunger games gladiatorial obsessed with you
[25:07.200 --> 25:15.760]  vapid uh shallow uh trendiness literally that's what this is all about and and and this is the
[25:15.760 --> 25:24.160]  programming of the public with the false manufacture of culture but what really clicked for me was
[25:24.800 --> 25:31.280]  that uh you know the actor senator great these the starlet the heroine is just an amazing actress
[25:31.280 --> 25:38.320]  and and you know obviously very beautiful so so it's a very alluring film but at its base they
[25:38.320 --> 25:42.560]  say in there we've got to crush this rebellion we've got to show people there's no leaders
[25:42.560 --> 25:47.280]  we've got to show people there's no hope kind of like rollerball which is uh that came out in the
[25:47.280 --> 25:51.440]  70s it's all about globalism and it's the same thing deindustrialized everywhere else
[25:52.240 --> 25:56.400]  centralized computer systems you don't have access to technological elites again they're
[25:56.400 --> 26:00.560]  showing you what they're building and then here we are 40 years later they've built it
[26:00.560 --> 26:05.520]  and then we'll be here 40 years later and it'll be complete and it's the end of humanity the end
[26:05.520 --> 26:11.440]  of freedom that's the basic goal of it but but looking at this film david night and understanding it
[26:12.160 --> 26:19.200]  it's key to to come down to the fact that they're trying to capture the revolution against tyranny
[26:19.200 --> 26:25.600]  they know is there and put it into a false socialist movement but but it is the so-called
[26:25.600 --> 26:31.920]  socialist and the so-called republicans who are pushing the same agenda so again this is just taking
[26:31.920 --> 26:37.040]  what's already going on in the real world and standardizing it into fiction to prepare the
[26:37.040 --> 26:44.880]  subconscious mind for it and expanding on that they have the actual black homeland security
[26:44.880 --> 26:50.400]  vehicles that they've distributed over 7 000 of the last few years that all the police departments
[26:50.400 --> 26:56.720]  are getting but but painting them tan for some reason it's those actual vehicles this again is
[26:56.720 --> 27:01.840]  just total preparation you know it really goes back to a neo feudalism as you mentioned in the
[27:01.840 --> 27:08.160]  last segment and the answer to feudalism is not socialism the answer to feudalism was 1776 the
[27:08.160 --> 27:13.920]  answer to it was the renaissance the discovery of the small business the discovery of of new
[27:13.920 --> 27:21.200]  ideas of the printing press of liberty liberty is the answer not socialism not stealing from the rich
[27:21.200 --> 27:26.720]  guys in the ivory towers to just pass it out to everybody but teaching everyone how to fish yes
[27:26.720 --> 27:31.840]  but again they don't allowing private property that was a key thing about feudalism and feudalism
[27:31.840 --> 27:35.360]  there were a few landlords that owned everything and that's what we see happening whether it's
[27:35.360 --> 27:41.280]  a trans-pacific partnership or whether it's regs that are coming out of washington it's this small
[27:41.280 --> 27:45.440]  group of people who want to assert ownership over everything that's what we see with the copyright
[27:45.440 --> 27:51.440]  laws syspa and other things they want to assert indefinite perpetual ownership over all intellectual
[27:51.440 --> 27:57.200]  property and make us all so they want to own the economy and have us be renters in it if we
[27:58.080 --> 28:01.360]  are even allowed to live and then finally i want to show people some headlines that tie into the
[28:01.360 --> 28:06.480]  police state this is just the last two days outside austin high school student watching two girls
[28:06.480 --> 28:10.720]  fight they admit they just walked up taser him in the back he fell over he's in a coma he's probably
[28:10.720 --> 28:17.520]  going to die and the police say if he doesn't die we're going to charge him uh with interfering with
[28:17.520 --> 28:21.920]  police yeah so i mean and again it's all about they're right they're in charge oh and here's the key
[28:21.920 --> 28:26.000]  the dallas police on wednesday night and then the sheriff's deputies were overheard on friday when
[28:26.000 --> 28:31.120]  they attacked his shed we need to go after and basically arrest alex jones to show him he can't
[28:31.120 --> 28:35.520]  just come down here and demonstrate they literally believe they'll lose control because they're doing
[28:35.520 --> 28:41.680]  such bad things and the system's doing this that we're being converted consciously to an authoritarian
[28:41.680 --> 28:48.080]  system now here's another one businessman arrested for loitering carrying legal gun on his own
[28:48.080 --> 28:53.040]  property by the police that's w sb tv i know you're going to cover that in more detail coming up
[28:53.040 --> 28:58.560]  david here's another one utah mom says healthy son 19 year old died he said he was going out of the
[28:58.560 --> 29:02.800]  country wanted to do the right thing fox news said he did the right thing he took the flu shot
[29:02.800 --> 29:07.200]  caused an autoimmune response and he died and they're basically admitting the flu shot killing
[29:07.200 --> 29:13.200]  the insert says it can kill you but here's the key david if he'd have been a baby and died they
[29:13.200 --> 29:17.760]  would have arrested her they know full well the shot kills the baby set an infant death the added
[29:17.760 --> 29:24.240]  goody is getting to put you in jail and and so so this is the system they're killing us with the
[29:24.240 --> 29:29.040]  vaccines the gmo's all of it the nanny state's not there to take care of us it's there to prey
[29:29.040 --> 29:34.560]  upon us and to dumb down civilization and to literally wage war on humanity david night you're
[29:34.560 --> 29:39.440]  going to be hosting the next uh wednesday and then of course on friday and today you're going to
[29:39.440 --> 29:44.320]  tell folks what's coming up after this i'm going to turn the helm and the calm over to you great job

[33:36.720 --> 33:39.920]  show i'm david night filling in for alex i'm going to be here the rest of the show but i'm
[33:39.920 --> 33:44.000]  going to be joined at the top of the hour with anthony gucciardi and we're going to take some
[33:44.000 --> 33:48.320]  of your calls at that time and later in the show jacari jackson is going to be joining me we're
[33:48.320 --> 33:53.440]  going to talk about the burgeoning police state among other issues but first i want to talk about
[33:53.440 --> 33:58.480]  uh thanksgiving a little bit you know at thanksgiving we had the pilgrims which actually
[33:58.480 --> 34:05.440]  literally means travelers or somebody on a journey they left where they were in england and later in
[34:05.440 --> 34:09.120]  holland because they didn't like the society they didn't like what government was doing to their
[34:09.120 --> 34:14.320]  families they didn't like the oppression and there was a lot of oppression whether it was religious
[34:14.320 --> 34:19.760]  or other issues oppression is still oppression and so they packed up and they left now today we
[34:19.760 --> 34:23.760]  can't really do that there's not really anywhere left to go that's why we're here that's why we're
[34:23.760 --> 34:29.920]  fighting i think uh all of us here at the staff at info wars know enough that we would be probably
[34:29.920 --> 34:33.680]  bugging out if there was any place to bug out to but there isn't and there's no place for you to go
[34:33.680 --> 34:38.560]  either so we have to do something about this and we have to take care of our own families
[34:38.560 --> 34:43.520]  one of the things that these people found when they came to the to the u.s they realized that
[34:43.520 --> 34:48.080]  they didn't know how to even grow their own food they were pretty much dependent on the society
[34:48.080 --> 34:53.760]  that they lived in and many of us are in that same situation today it's time to start taking that back
[34:54.400 --> 35:00.960]  you can go to info wars store.com and you can get the survival seeds you can we have an info wars
[35:00.960 --> 35:06.720]  seed center it has the widest selection of non-gmo non-hybrid heirloom seeds available
[35:06.720 --> 35:12.000]  and we've got seeds there from my patriot supply emergency seed bank heirloom organics and arc
[35:12.640 --> 35:16.960]  it's something you can do for your family and you can teach others you can teach people who are
[35:16.960 --> 35:21.840]  friends and family you can be basically squanto to them you can teach them how to survive because
[35:21.840 --> 35:27.600]  you know it's not just a matter of leaving society our shaky infrastructure could leave you at any
[35:27.600 --> 35:31.440]  moment you never know when that infrastructure is going to go down and you could be in the same
[35:31.440 --> 35:36.640]  situation as the pilgrims who are starving through that first year until they finally figured out how
[35:36.640 --> 35:41.600]  to grow food right now you've got the time and you want to start with the very best material
[35:41.600 --> 35:46.320]  that's why you should go to info wars store.com it helps to support our operation that's how we
[35:46.320 --> 35:51.120]  support our operation we give you products that will help you in your life and it also funds
[35:51.120 --> 35:58.320]  our operation it's a win-win situation now last week as alex was in dallas with the crew and they
[35:58.320 --> 36:03.200]  were protesting first amendment because that was really the issue we've been lied to for 50 years
[36:03.200 --> 36:07.200]  about what was going on with the kennedy assassination they don't want people talking about
[36:07.200 --> 36:11.520]  the real facts they don't want people questioning the silly story that they're putting out the
[36:11.520 --> 36:17.040]  narrative it's obvious that there's a cover-up people could see that 50 years ago and for 50 years
[36:17.040 --> 36:20.720]  they've got documents that they haven't released for 50 years have been told the documents were
[36:20.720 --> 36:26.880]  burned destroyed that they didn't take any notes of the interrogation of lee hovrey oswald for 12
[36:26.880 --> 36:31.680]  hours that they took no notes whatever whatsoever when they're investigating the assassination
[36:31.680 --> 36:36.880]  of a president none of this rang true from the very beginning but it was about more than that
[36:36.880 --> 36:41.520]  it was about the fact that they were shutting everything down for the 50th anniversary even to
[36:41.520 --> 36:47.920]  the ridiculous extent of paving over the x that marks the spot you know the the fellow who
[36:49.200 --> 36:54.240]  found the Zapruder tape who got it out of the congressional committee what's that surfaced
[36:54.240 --> 36:59.440]  they were not going to show that to the public and when he put that out there he's been there
[36:59.440 --> 37:04.400]  ever since selling robert groden has been selling information about the assassination
[37:04.400 --> 37:09.520]  to people giving them information onsite fighting the dallas city officials who are continually
[37:09.520 --> 37:14.880]  moving him away arresting him he's got a lawsuit going on now and he put an x and has continued
[37:14.880 --> 37:19.440]  to put an x as they remove it at the spot where kennedy was shot so people can go there and see
[37:19.440 --> 37:25.440]  for themselves whether or not that aspect of the assassination is being correctly reported
[37:25.440 --> 37:29.760]  in the official story but of course even that they wanted to get rid of and they went to such
[37:29.760 --> 37:35.520]  extraordinary links it was absolutely amazing to see that not only did they not just pull up the
[37:35.520 --> 37:41.120]  piece of tape they said that they were afraid people would trip over a piece of tape on the ground
[37:41.120 --> 37:46.640]  so they didn't just pull it up what they did was they continually paved over that section of road
[37:46.640 --> 37:50.960]  they didn't just pave over it once they were they were working on it the entire time of the
[37:52.000 --> 37:56.960]  commemoration to basically keep people off of it and to keep him and others to keep groden and
[37:56.960 --> 38:02.720]  others from going down there and putting the x back on it was amazing piece of censorship and then
[38:02.720 --> 38:08.240]  it was followed up as we were in overdrive it was followed up with the police unprovoked and
[38:08.240 --> 38:12.640]  without warning coming in and attacking alex jones the protesters that were with him the staff that
[38:12.640 --> 38:18.480]  were with him after they'd been led into the area by the police standing there calmly waiting to get
[38:18.480 --> 38:23.200]  access a little bit farther in then they were attacked by all of these goons essentially from
[38:23.200 --> 38:29.120]  the federal police we can see them coming out of the homeland security trailer and just walk up and
[38:29.120 --> 38:35.280]  start punching and shoving people and as I was driving home after I'd just seen this I hear on
[38:35.280 --> 38:39.680]  the radio for the first time the story about the student down in Bastrop where the police just walk
[38:39.680 --> 38:44.560]  up and without warning according to the family's lawyer that's what they're the family is alleging
[38:44.560 --> 38:49.360]  and that's what a lot of the students are alleging who walked out they had a walk out there at the
[38:49.360 --> 38:54.240]  high school in Bastrop which is just a little bit south here of Austin and the other students
[38:54.240 --> 39:00.480]  walked out and discussed in an anger that this would happen to another student there there was
[39:00.480 --> 39:04.960]  a fight he was standing around he didn't get out of the way as quickly as the police wanted him to
[39:04.960 --> 39:09.440]  get out of the way so they just tasered him he felt lost consciousness as this often happens
[39:09.440 --> 39:15.200]  just like with the knockout game if you are immediately clocked or lose your lose consciousness
[39:15.200 --> 39:21.120]  with a knockout game or you're hit with a taser you hit the concrete floor many people have been
[39:21.120 --> 39:25.760]  seriously injured at least one person has died from the knockout game and this is happening all
[39:25.760 --> 39:30.160]  the time with tasers it's essentially the same thing it's the police playing the knockout game
[39:30.160 --> 39:34.000]  and what the police said this is amazing they haven't talked much because of course this is an open
[39:34.000 --> 39:41.120]  investigation but what they said was that he looked as though he were ready to fight see if you even
[39:41.120 --> 39:48.000]  give them the wrong look they feel justified to taser you and what's making this worse we see
[39:48.000 --> 39:52.640]  this happening all the time throughout the country just a little bit farther south in San Antonio
[39:52.640 --> 39:59.440]  we now see that an officer has been arrested while he was on duty he raped a young woman
[39:59.440 --> 40:08.800]  on the squad car he's 40 years old i think the lady was 19 and this uh yes a 19 year old woman
[40:08.800 --> 40:15.920]  just raped her on duty as a police officer pulls her over and rapes her and then this this story
[40:15.920 --> 40:21.600]  this is uh one that broke on uh ben swan's site cops spray a woman's vagina with mace
[40:22.400 --> 40:27.440]  in order to punish her in order to punish her again this is new mexico we've seen a lot of
[40:27.440 --> 40:32.160]  stuff coming out of new mexico lately that's that's absolutely amazing my wife looked at the story and
[40:32.160 --> 40:37.600]  said we are never going through that state people in new mexico need to try to get a hold of their
[40:37.600 --> 40:42.480]  police departments and control them but you know it's not just new mexico i wish it was just new
[40:42.480 --> 40:46.400]  mexico this is happening everywhere those first two stories i just talked about those are right here
[40:46.400 --> 40:53.760]  in texas there is no accountability to the police it doesn't matter what they do there's no accountability
[40:53.760 --> 40:59.280]  to them between the unions and between this club that they've got going nobody has ever held to
[40:59.280 --> 41:03.600]  account for these crimes and as long as that happens these things are going to continue to
[41:03.600 --> 41:10.320]  multiply now in this particular instance uh she was in a jail and uh they were taking her to a
[41:10.320 --> 41:16.320]  detention center and the staff did this to quote unquote punish her they said it's tantamount to
[41:16.320 --> 41:20.400]  torture this is the aclu talking about it it's tantamount to torture it's just maliciousness
[41:20.400 --> 41:24.800]  the wanton disregard the wanton maliciousness that the corrections officer demonstrated
[41:24.800 --> 41:29.280]  this is the kind of chemical that is intended to be sprayed on other parts of the body to
[41:29.280 --> 41:34.720]  cause pain but to spray it on the very most sensitive part of a person's body only doubles
[41:34.720 --> 41:40.480]  the pain it probably is even more than doubling the pain it's absolutely amazing and it's exactly
[41:40.480 --> 41:46.000]  you know alex was just in here talking about the hunger games and you see there the arrogance
[41:46.000 --> 41:50.560]  that was the thing that was bothering me about the live broadcast from dalas even before they came
[41:50.560 --> 41:58.480]  out punching and that was to see how the police were so incredibly arrogant with anybody that
[41:58.480 --> 42:02.720]  wanted to talk to them asked them a decent question asked them a question about where
[42:02.720 --> 42:07.520]  something is give them give me directions or even after the event when alex asked them
[42:07.520 --> 42:12.720]  where do i file a charge i've just been assaulted by the sheriff's deputies and they were
[42:12.720 --> 42:17.040]  incredibly arrogant in most cases they wouldn't even make eye contact with people who are talking
[42:17.040 --> 42:21.280]  to them and it isn't just the fact that they were there as part of a demonstration i've seen
[42:21.280 --> 42:26.800]  that over and over again and as we were talking about last thursday when jacari jackson and i went
[42:26.800 --> 42:33.920]  down to the austin airport to try to talk to the tsa they stonewall us they tell us uh we're not
[42:33.920 --> 42:37.520]  going to talk to you you have to submit questions of course when we submit questions they don't
[42:37.520 --> 42:42.160]  respond to us when they come up and talk to us they say we're not going to talk on on the air
[42:42.160 --> 42:48.160]  and these are the public information officers that's what their job is their job is to inform
[42:48.160 --> 42:55.440]  the public their job is to talk to the press they are arrogant and contemptuous and and it's when
[42:55.440 --> 43:00.320]  you see these types of things happening uh that they've done to these women that they've done to
[43:00.320 --> 43:06.160]  these children it's not surprising to see them do it to people who are protesting for the first
[43:06.160 --> 43:11.040]  amendment i've got to say that when we look at this first amendment protest in dallas and we look
[43:11.040 --> 43:16.480]  at the second amendment protest that we went to down in san antonio the police were not afraid
[43:16.480 --> 43:21.280]  to come after a lot of people even though we had a lot of cameras there even though we were broadcasting
[43:21.280 --> 43:25.680]  live maybe they didn't know that we were broadcasting live i would think that they would we'd been
[43:25.680 --> 43:30.320]  saying that we were doing that and at the time that they did that we had a million people watching
[43:30.320 --> 43:36.160]  just on the youtube on the ustream channel and actually crashed ustream now if you go back and
[43:36.160 --> 43:40.400]  look at those videos it's kind of interesting because ustream doesn't count the number of people
[43:40.400 --> 43:44.320]  that were watching it live they only count the number of videos a number of views of people
[43:44.320 --> 43:49.280]  that are watching the archive version but uh they could see it on this screen they snapshot the screen
[43:49.280 --> 43:54.000]  we had a million people just on that stream not counting people who are listening to our broadcast
[43:54.000 --> 43:58.880]  or listening on the radio because we were in overdrive at that time some of the radio stations
[43:58.880 --> 44:04.160]  that are listening to us right now we're not on there at that time yes but we will never be mainstream
[44:04.160 --> 44:08.880]  if we had a billion listeners we're not important that's right that's right people that the government
[44:08.880 --> 44:14.240]  certifies they are important that's right that's right and it's interesting to see how those alex
[44:14.240 --> 44:20.640]  poppin in here and making his comment it's interesting to see that the mainstream media
[44:20.640 --> 44:26.480]  essentially ignored it except to attack us as conspiracy theorists and remember that that
[44:26.480 --> 44:32.080]  was a term that was created by the cia in the wake of the kennedy assassination and that was used
[44:32.080 --> 44:37.680]  as a deliberate method to make people to to ridicule people to turn it into an ad hominem
[44:37.680 --> 44:42.800]  attack to ignore what's actually happened and we've got a video here that i want to play for you
[44:42.800 --> 44:47.040]  this is a special report we had on the nightly news and that's something if you're not supporting the
[44:47.040 --> 44:52.160]  nightly news you really need to consider that it's coming up christmas time it's a great gift for
[44:52.160 --> 44:57.920]  people you can see every one of the documentaries that alex and crew have made and if you saw that
[44:57.920 --> 45:02.640]  clip at the beginning that alex put together with darin mcbreen and others that that was an
[45:02.640 --> 45:06.800]  amazing piece of work and alex has been working on this next documentary it's going to be coming
[45:06.800 --> 45:11.920]  out in the spring we have a wealth of information there they can watch our documentaries all of them
[45:11.920 --> 45:16.640]  for free as well as get a nightly news broadcast so that's something that just a little plug there you
[45:16.640 --> 45:21.760]  can uh share that at christmas time it's a great gift for people but let's go to this report that
[45:21.760 --> 45:27.360]  i did for the nightly news about government conspiracies and coverups well three years after
[45:27.360 --> 45:34.640]  an mi6 code breaker's body was found padlocked in a bag in an empty bathtub in an mi6 safe house
[45:34.640 --> 45:39.360]  the london metropolitan police have ruled that it was an accident allow me to congratulate you on
[45:39.360 --> 45:44.560]  a brilliant bit of deduction that's right move along there's nothing to see here but there is
[45:44.560 --> 45:51.440]  plenty to see here about how governments work his body was found inside a zipped and padlocked bag
[45:51.440 --> 45:57.200]  in a bathtub no palm prints were on the side of the bathtub no traces of his dna on the padlock
[45:57.200 --> 46:03.440]  outside of the bag his cell phone was wiped clean that day and his employer mi6 that's
[46:03.440 --> 46:08.800]  british intelligence didn't report him missing for eight days despite the fact that his body was in
[46:08.800 --> 46:13.680]  one of their safe houses just blocks away from their headquarters and just last year the coroner
[46:13.680 --> 46:19.440]  concluded that he probably was killed by another person coroner fiona wilcox said that it was quote
[46:19.440 --> 46:25.040]  a legitimate line of inquiry that other spies were involved in the death of garith williams 31
[46:25.040 --> 46:31.520]  a member of the uk's secret intelligence service s is also known as mi6 but metropolitan police
[46:31.520 --> 46:38.720]  said he probably died accidentally on his own rejecting conspiracy theories his family said
[46:38.720 --> 46:44.320]  if this wasn't the sis and it was the cray twins or someone else you would be investigating you
[46:44.320 --> 46:49.680]  would have gone into far more detail and there were some more details thrown in he had 30 000
[46:49.680 --> 46:55.920]  dollars worth of unworn women's clothing a bright red wig and some suspicious sexual things there
[46:55.920 --> 47:02.000]  but the coroner's investigation ruled that he was not gay not a transvestite those things i
[47:02.000 --> 47:07.360]  believe were simply red herrings to distract people from what the real question is and that is
[47:07.360 --> 47:12.960]  how could he have gotten padlocked into the bag the press association reported that a former
[47:12.960 --> 47:18.640]  parachute regiment reservist who specializes in rescuing people from confined spaces was
[47:18.640 --> 47:24.640]  unable to lock himself inside an identical bag no palm prints were on the side of the bathtub
[47:24.640 --> 47:30.880]  no traces of his dna on the padlock outside of the bag he said i couldn't say it's impossible but i
[47:30.880 --> 47:35.440]  think even houdini would have struggled with this one this is something we've seen not just in the
[47:35.440 --> 47:41.040]  uk but frequently in the united states that people who have sensitive information about government
[47:41.040 --> 47:48.400]  secrets or about the people who run the government somehow just mysteriously die or commit suicide
[47:48.400 --> 47:52.720]  even though they didn't have any history of being suicidal and even though the explanations for their
[47:52.720 --> 47:59.280]  deaths make absolutely no sense take the case of gary webb investigative reporter who supposedly
[47:59.280 --> 48:05.200]  committed suicide by shooting himself in the head twice it was merely coincidental that he had
[48:05.200 --> 48:11.520]  exposed cia and reagan administration using the crack cocaine drug trade to finance nick rogwin
[48:11.520 --> 48:17.600]  contras or take debrajean paulfrey the dc madam who had perhaps incriminating information on very
[48:17.600 --> 48:24.160]  powerful men in washington she said this on the alex jones show in 2008 shortly before she was
[48:24.160 --> 48:30.000]  suicided i have no intention of letting anyone buy me off or make any kind of a deal with me
[48:30.000 --> 48:34.400]  and you're not planning to commit suicide and i'm not planning to commit suicide either but you
[48:34.400 --> 48:38.560]  want to put it on record that you're not planning to commit suicide no i'm not planning to commit
[48:38.560 --> 48:43.840]  suicide i'm planning to go into court on april seventh if indeed we do have the trial and i
[48:43.840 --> 48:49.520]  plan on defending myself vigorously and i plan on exposing the government uh
[48:50.800 --> 48:56.080]  in ways that you know i do not think they want me to expose them i want them to explain to me
[48:56.080 --> 49:02.800]  in open court why they came after me or take erin schwarz a feisty internet freedom activist who
[49:02.800 --> 49:09.200]  led the defeat of syspa we did it we won and then we started rubbing it in we're told that he hung
[49:09.200 --> 49:14.560]  himself also in a fit of depression concerned about the possibility of a long jail term
[49:14.560 --> 49:21.120]  sentence he asked his fiance to marry him just two months before his death two months after
[49:21.120 --> 49:26.160]  federal prosecutors came after him with ridiculously trumped up charges for downloading files from
[49:26.160 --> 49:32.960]  mit which neither the repository nor local law enforcement wanted to prosecute and the prosecutor
[49:32.960 --> 49:40.400]  karmann ortiz's husband had tweeted that he had refused a plea bargain for just a three month sentence
[49:40.400 --> 49:45.600]  or look at the improbable details in michael hastings death in a car explosion he was being
[49:45.600 --> 49:50.240]  pursued by the nsa and the fbi for a story that he was writing and had warned colleagues that they
[49:50.240 --> 49:55.200]  would be questioned and then there's the jfk assassination where the lies are even more obvious
[49:55.200 --> 50:01.280]  after 50 years but of course if you question any of these improbable stories you're labeled a
[50:01.280 --> 50:06.080]  conspiracy theorist and told to shut up for info wars nightly news i'm david night
[50:10.000 --> 50:16.080]  and he said of course there's also the person in arkansas who was found with his arms and legs
[50:16.080 --> 50:20.240]  saw it off and they ruled that was a suicide as well you know there's so many of these
[50:20.240 --> 50:25.040]  we don't have time to do them all in one report you could do an entire documentary on government
[50:25.040 --> 50:30.880]  suicides but it's interesting to see how they followed up on this spine a bag story they used
[50:30.880 --> 50:37.200]  the media they had the media come in and film a woman who was a yoga instructor about four inches
[50:37.200 --> 50:44.000]  shorter quite a bit lighter and she was able to get herself in that bag and lock it but she still
[50:44.000 --> 50:48.560]  wasn't able to do it without getting her fingerprints and dna on the outside and that's the way they
[50:48.560 --> 50:53.360]  fake these things we've seen this over and over again if you want to know why this is going on
[50:53.360 --> 50:57.040]  you ask questions you want to investigate your conspiracy theorist we're going to be right back
[50:57.040 --> 51:03.680]  we're going to have some analysis not theories in the last 50 years iodine has been phased out of
[51:03.680 --> 51:10.320]  our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine a practice now banned in nations around
[51:10.320 --> 51:15.840]  the world guess what else is in the halogen family fluoride ladies and gentlemen alex jones here in
[51:15.840 --> 51:22.720]  1924 the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's
[51:22.720 --> 51:29.200]  the good halogen on the periodic table and the results are on record reports documented a 15
[51:29.200 --> 51:35.360]  point iq increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine bottom line iodine is

[54:28.480 --> 54:33.360]  david night julian for alex now alex is here he's working on the documentary he just popped in and
[54:33.360 --> 54:39.200]  said maybe they could get that lady that got in the bag where they had the spy in the bag we just
[54:39.200 --> 54:44.880]  had the report last segment of a spy they found locked in a bag padlock from the outside no fingerprints
[54:44.880 --> 54:51.840]  no dna on the outside and scotland yard brilliantly ruled that it was an accidental death even after
[54:51.840 --> 54:56.960]  a year ago the coroner came out and said the obvious that he had been murdered and put there by
[54:56.960 --> 55:02.560]  somebody else and the alex had had mentioned this ark inside about the guy who was found with his
[55:02.560 --> 55:09.280]  arms and legs sawn off and the police ruled that that was a suicide maybe they could try to get that
[55:09.280 --> 55:14.800]  yoga instructor to duplicate that trick i don't know i don't think that's possible but getting
[55:14.800 --> 55:18.480]  on to something serious here you know we were talking about alex came in the beginning of the
[55:18.480 --> 55:25.760]  program was talking about the hunger games and how that is the kind of economic collapse and then
[55:25.760 --> 55:32.800]  feudalism that follows where everything is owned by just a few people and everyone is in such desperate
[55:32.800 --> 55:39.200]  straits to eat to survive that's already started in greece that's already started where they've
[55:39.200 --> 55:45.040]  put the goldman sacks bankers in charge of the government there and we have this story here
[55:45.040 --> 55:49.360]  that is on info wars it's actually originally an rt story and they're talking about the world
[55:49.360 --> 55:56.480]  health organization going in and reporting that since 2008 they've had this massive rise in hiv
[55:56.480 --> 56:04.080]  rates and what they said is that half of these new hiv infections are self-inflicted and why would
[56:04.080 --> 56:09.760]  people give themselves aids the world health organization says this is to enable people to
[56:09.760 --> 56:17.680]  receive benefits of 700 euros per month and faster admission into drugs drug substitution programs
[56:17.680 --> 56:22.560]  if you look at the article on info wars there's this picture that a photographer took of this old
[56:22.560 --> 56:27.840]  man humped over and walking along he just came out of a one euro store is kind of like a dollar
[56:27.840 --> 56:33.040]  store over here in the u.s. and this fellow he wrote about he took his picture and put it as
[56:33.040 --> 56:38.800]  it's an epic picture it looks like something out of the great depression and it looks like something
[56:38.800 --> 56:44.400]  that we may be facing here in this country as well and greece the photographer wrote this
[56:44.400 --> 56:49.040]  accompanying information he said unemployment is 26% and by the end of the year it'll reach
[56:49.040 --> 56:55.200]  34% of the active population and he said this is the kind of unemployment that is only noted in
[56:55.200 --> 57:02.640]  countries that have typically been facing long-term wars well see it's unusual but this is a long-term
[57:02.640 --> 57:08.000]  war as alex was pointing out this has been their plan for a very long time when he interviewed
[57:08.000 --> 57:13.200]  professor woods and we're going to have that in a rebroadcast on thursday and they were talking
[57:13.200 --> 57:18.400]  about neo feudalism and he mentioned that this was something that they even as far back of course
[57:18.400 --> 57:25.600]  alex mentions it goes back to the middle of the 1800s but even in the 1930s they were talking about
[57:26.160 --> 57:32.800]  changing the credits from money-based system to an energy-based system and if you notice
[57:33.600 --> 57:37.520]  that's what they're trying on the 100th anniversary of the federal reserve if you look at what these
[57:37.520 --> 57:43.680]  carbon credits are my opinion what that is is essentially the federal reserve and this private
[57:43.680 --> 57:50.640]  corporation being able to charge interest anybody that has as as as money is created this private
[57:50.640 --> 57:56.960]  cartel gets to charge the entire united states population interest for every dollar that they
[57:56.960 --> 58:01.520]  print and they of course decide how many dollars are going to print in the same way if we allow these
[58:01.520 --> 58:07.840]  private carbon credits that algore and his partner blood blood and gore and others are trying to set
[58:07.840 --> 58:12.640]  up if we allow them to do that if we allow them to change everything over to this energy system
[58:12.640 --> 58:16.960]  that they're trying to do they will measure everything that we do it's going to be much
[58:16.960 --> 58:21.840]  more lucrative for them it'll be global it's another way of establishing in my opinion
[58:21.840 --> 58:29.280]  a global federal reserve and that's exactly what they were planning in the 1930s 40 years 40 years
[58:29.280 --> 58:33.760]  before they started talking about global cooling and then about global warming this predated the
[58:33.760 --> 58:38.320]  environmentalist movement for a long time this is a long-term war we're going to be right back
[58:43.040 --> 58:47.120]  this is gcn the genesis communications radio network
[58:50.240 --> 58:54.960]  alex jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers the prognosis for the entire
[58:54.960 --> 59:01.600]  planetary economic system runs from bad to worse the globalist model is to shut down societies and

[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:21.280]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:30.240]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night filling in for alex i'm going to be
[01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:34.240]  joined in the next segment with anthony gucciardi is going to come in here we're going to talk about
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:39.440]  political correctness you know we talked about how they try to demonize and do a hominem attacks on
[01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:45.200]  people calling them conspiracy theorists and that's a technique that started after the kennedy
[01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:50.960]  assassination it was a way to shut down people who were trying to investigate what really happened
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:55.680]  the government did everything it could to cover it up they offered us implausible explanations
[01:00:55.680 --> 01:01:01.200]  and we have seen that happen over and over and over again for the last 50 years they set the
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:05.360]  pattern up for the kennedy assassination and we've seen that happening over and over again of course
[01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:09.920]  false flags and government conspiracies and cover-ups predate the kennedy assassination
[01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:15.520]  obviously we've seen this in cultures throughout history we've seen it with a reishtag fire in
[01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:22.400]  germany but it's a very carefully planned and orchestrated partnership with the media operation
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:26.960]  mockingbird you see them talking about people as conspiracy theorists as long as they start
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:31.280]  throwing that term at people they don't really have to explain away what we're talking about they
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:36.560]  just basically attack us as conspiracy theorists and that's what we see happening in dallas that's
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:41.920]  what these dallas morning news did to the demonstrators to alex jones there they simply
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:47.440]  talked about how there were some people there and there's one fellow in a 1776 costume and
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:51.920]  another guy who was holding a puppet and then they just talk about alex jones and he's this
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:57.520]  conspiracy theorist never talking about the fact that there was censorship going on never talking
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:02.240]  about the shutting down of the first amendment and this is a newspaper but that's okay dallas
[01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:07.360]  morning news we will fight for the first amendment we'll fight for your right to say what you want to
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:12.080]  until you wake up until you get off of the government payroll until you start trying to
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:16.400]  not suck up to people for access until you want to honestly report the news you know the guy who
[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:22.240]  was there with a puppet maybe he was having a good time maybe he was kind of making a point
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:27.120]  about puppet media who knows but we're going to be talking to anthony gucciardi in the next
[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:31.920]  segment we've got a lot of news here you know it just came out yesterday they said that the troops
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:36.800]  are going to be in afghanistan for another 10 years well if you go back and you look to the
[01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:43.920]  independent back in 2006 you got a british general saying at that time that was 2006 troops will be
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:49.120]  in afghanistan for the next 20 years is what he said and it was kind of interesting as brigadier
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:53.760]  butler and he said that international presence may be required in afghanistan for the next 20
[01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:59.360]  years this was back in 2006 and then in the same article from the independent it's very interesting
[01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:06.080]  because they talked about how opium cultivation was rising at that time 59 per year according to
[01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:12.800]  the un figures an all-time record crop and they point out that 90 percent of the heroin on british
[01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:19.520]  streets was coming from afghanistan 90 percent of the heroin worldwide is coming from afghanistan
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:25.920]  it was down to only 10 on the taliban once we went in and established it it jumped to 90 percent of
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:31.520]  the world's supply and of course they say that it's in this article that it is number one priority
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:37.040]  this is back in 2006 seven years ago they said you can say that afghanistan is pretty much out of
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:42.400]  control said someone with the un drug program he said afghanistan is basically supplying the world's
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:47.120]  opium and there's also evidence that the country's increasingly hooked on its own opium and they're
[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:51.840]  going to have nato troops and their afghan allies attack heroin labs well you know what that didn't
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:58.400]  happen as we saw with heraldo rivera what the what the us and nato troops did was they actually
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:03.520]  helped them they actually transported the drugs for them they actually helped them in the holiday
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:11.840]  and the uh uh the poppy feeds that's why they're there it's not just for this quote unquote war
[01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:16.880]  on terrorism which is going to last forever it's not going to be 20 years it'll never end
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:20.720]  we're going to have to end it we're going to have to end it by returning the government
[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:26.400]  to constitutional checks and balances we're going to have to end it by waking up but it's it's not
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:31.840]  going to end they went there for the heroin it funds their special secretive ops and it's also
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:38.320]  one of the places on earth that has the highest concentration of lithium now lithium is not
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:43.120]  used just to control people psychologically but it's a major component of batteries and so we've
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:48.960]  got a lot of resources there that the new world order the neocolonialists the neo feudalists want
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:53.840]  to have it provides funding for their black operations we're going to be there for a long
[01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:57.760]  time but we're going to be right back with anthony gucciardi we're going to be talking
[01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:02.960]  about political correctness so stay tuned why does the united states spend the largest percentage
[01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:08.640]  of gdp in the world on health care why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet the highest
[01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:16.240]  rates of diabetes autism and every other major disease it all comes down to one thing we are

[01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:21.840]  1924 the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine

[01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:29.200]  texas alex jones welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night filling in for alex and i'm
[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:34.640]  joined here live in studio with anthony gutiarty at story lake and we're going to talk to him about
[01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:39.920]  political correctness about mind control and about the way the government and the media carefully
[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:45.440]  shaped the agenda now i want you to think back it's only been about two years ago the lead up to
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:50.880]  the presidential election and remember what a stink it caused when some conservative candidates
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:57.040]  talked about the death panels and obama care everybody just railed about them but listen
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:09:02.720]  to this revelation to this confession from somebody who represents the left's position on this
[01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:08.800]  mark so you believe that there will be rationing aka death panels built into the plan it's not it's
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:13.360]  not like it's not like a gas or like a judgment that that's that's going to be part of how can
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:18.240]  cost or control yeah okay well but i but i'll say something else about that issue which is
[01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:23.680]  we do need to do some of that in this country because we can't afford to spend so much on end
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:28.240]  of life care a very high percentage of our health care spending is for a very small number of people
[01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:33.520]  at the last stages of their life i'm not saying the system shouldn't allow that but but but there's
[01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:38.480]  too much cost their judgments have to be made with the society made by who mark mark made by who the
[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:42.720]  government by no by individuals but it's not going to be made by individuals if you say it's
[01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:47.120]  included in the health care if you're not now it's not now for many people have insurance their
[01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:50.720]  insurance companies make those but they don't they don't pull they don't think it's very rare
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:54.880]  that they in other words if someone needs a bypass that's good that's uh steve mallsburg
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:10:00.400]  newsmax interviewed mark halpern and that's mark halpern who immediately takes the jump
[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:05.840]  anthony you know first of all for years death panels that was a laughable thing you know you
[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:10.480]  could demonize somebody just like calling them conspiracies there is to say that he's talking
[01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:14.800]  about death panels but they very quickly go but oh yeah there's death panels in it and it's a good
[01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:20.640]  thing see how they how quickly they pivoted so for years they say doesn't exist and we see this
[01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:25.280]  over and over and over again in so many different areas for years it doesn't exist you're crazy
[01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:30.160]  conspiracy theorist if you think it does you don't understand what's going on and they demonize
[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:33.920]  people for that and then all of a sudden they say no you're right but it's a good thing now that
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:38.480]  we're doing this now that's exactly right and i've come to the conclusion now we're going to get
[01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:45.120]  into this specifically why this society is so tightly controlled why julia ceasar hitler
[01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:50.640]  stallin and mal all failed but achieved so much in a short period of time and why this society is
[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:54.880]  actually going along with what the elite are saying even though it's so blatantly in our face
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:11:00.080]  and it was about two days ago i was doing an interview with a major network on the subject
[01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:06.320]  of antidepressants and psychotropic drugs and it was prerecorded we were talking you know more
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:11.840]  than 20 percent of kids now are diagnosed with ADHD they're on the pharmaceutical drugs that
[01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:17.600]  admittedly from the 1980s elie lily covered it all up admittedly caused more depression
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:23.200]  more suicide more aggressive behavior and the fda just lets them slide on at all but we were
[01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:27.840]  talking specifically about that in about two-thirds the way into the prerecorded interview i said you
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:33.920]  know what everything else i said before this doesn't matter here is the key and it was actually a
[01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:39.920]  realization by myself as well something i'm going to call a neo-conquest of the society what's going
[01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:47.280]  on now is you know Julius Caesar more like more so hitler had these zealots behind him these legions
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:52.880]  of believers that truly believed what he was doing they were so diluted and buying into the
[01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:56.960]  propaganda that they stood behind him and they're willing to die for him in war they're willing to
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:02.000]  give up their children to the hitler youth or stallin even the idea of communism they bought
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:07.200]  into this thing that was bigger than themselves because it was such a polarizing thing but the
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:12.320]  issue with that is at the same time since it's so polarizing hitler also had detractors he had
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:18.000]  you know enemies within his own organization his own cult organization the difference now this is
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:26.400]  neo-conquest this is a societal takeover that relies heavily on lethargy and ap apathy yes this is
[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:31.600]  never before seen julius Caesar was intelligent enough to try this at one point but they didn't
[01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:36.720]  have the technology at the time you know the infamous bread and circus that's nothing now we
[01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:41.840]  have portals of the coliseum that stream directly into your living room yes you know that was a
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:44.960]  live event that would happen from time to time they would or the virtual world that they're
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:48.800]  working on i mean look at how they're going by leaps and bounds and they're talking about now
[01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:53.360]  creating a virtual world with so many sensory feedbacks that you don't ever want to leave
[01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:58.960]  they have live sex bots now in japan i just saw this video that will perform any action you want
[01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:04.080]  you put on and it's called an oculus rift it's a 3d world where you've envisioned these cartoon
[01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:10.000]  women inside of it they have anything you want yeah this has never been successfully done you
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:14.400]  know hitler was a hard takeover hitler had the cult organization stalin had the cult organization
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:18.400]  but look at stalin even the high level people in his cabinet wanted to kill him yeah he was
[01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:22.080]  super paranoid yes but they did actually want to kill him at the same time because guess what if
[01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:27.280]  you kill stalin you take the power if you kill hitler you take the power but here's the difference
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:33.520]  in the united states of america it's all corrupt there's no power to be taken it is so bad that the
[01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:37.040]  ultimate thing they're doing is admitting everything now because they're saying yes
[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:40.960]  we're all catering to the moderates they say every election what do they talk about all day
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:47.040]  long the moderates this idea of not too hot not too cold every single thing they're doing now
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:51.920]  is yes they have some fans of obama some fervent fans of obama but bottom line is
[01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:56.960]  it's almost against the political politically correct laws to speak out and care about things
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:14:00.640]  that's why alex is having such success because people say oh my god he's actually energized
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:04.960]  about these things you know all of us are actually energized about these things the whole system
[01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:09.520]  is to shut us down and suppress our ability to feel things and care about things absolutely
[01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:15.120]  ruled by apathy and i think a key part of it is this this article you mentioned to the cdc says
[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:20.320]  that more than 20 percent of 14 year old boys are diagnosed with adhd that's on info wars right now
[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:24.720]  that's something we've seen for quite a long time we've homeschooled our children
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:33.200]  uh started you know 15 years ago and at the time we heard this exact same thing and that it was
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:38.720]  it was skewed towards males because they don't naturally want to go sit in a classroom that's
[01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:42.640]  something works out really well for females but i know when we're homeschooling our sons
[01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:48.480]  if we would make them sit absolutely still and listen to something that we're presenting to them
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:53.280]  or or assignment that they were doing they wouldn't retain anything but if we'd let them kind of dance
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:57.120]  around in the city that you thought that they weren't learning anything they would retain
[01:14:57.120 --> 01:15:01.840]  everything so we kind of learned that that early but this is deliberate charlotte isaby and others
[01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:06.160]  have talked about the deliberate dumbing down of america we saw that book here at info wars
[01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:11.360]  this is something that has been a key element of this has not just been we're seeing it in
[01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:15.760]  its final stages now with the electronics that are that are coming online in the game world
[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:19.520]  the virtual world so they're putting people in but they've been trying to dumb people down
[01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:25.680]  deliberately the the schools have been a center of social engineering from their inception if you
[01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:30.800]  go back and look at what do we and man and others talked about that was their purpose people say
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:36.080]  why can't johnny reid that was not the intention of the schools that's what they told the parents
[01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:43.040]  but their real agenda was one of basically getting people to be subservient to the state to understand
[01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:46.320]  that it's the mother and father that it's the authority on everything can you imagine if
[01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:50.960]  he told sullen back in the day that yes we have a drug anyone that stands out in the classroom
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:55.280]  and questions the officials these teachers everything like that that not only will sedate them
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:16:00.640]  and take away their ability to think intellectually but we actually have profit driven incentives for
[01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:05.360]  the teachers and the doctors to go ahead and do it yes the teachers see hey this kid's annoying me
[01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:09.520]  you know he's messing with our official story send him over to the doctor this happened to me when
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:13.520]  i was younger by the way i was asking questions and talking too much to my friends and they sent
[01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:18.080]  me to my doctor and he gave me a sheet and there was i believe eight or ten questions the number
[01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:23.600]  one question was who is your hero and i wrote some rock musician that i liked at the time
[01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:30.400]  and he just looked at that he was like yeah you have add and well you know what most business
[01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:34.160]  owners and self starters and entrepreneurs do have add that's why they work well do you think
[01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:37.840]  they would have given riddle into alex jones i mean they would have given it to him they would
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:41.520]  try to give it to you anybody that wants to be a self starter they would give it quote unquote
[01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:46.640]  add you know it's just is just a label given to people that are questioning things yes and the
[01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:51.200]  whole system though is that this wouldn't work if the if they if there wasn't a profit driven
[01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:55.840]  center to it all a central system where the doctors are giving kit back kickbacks by the
[01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:58.960]  drug companies you know massive hundreds of thousands of dollars you can look up your
[01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:03.200]  doctors online and find how much money they've gotten my harvard doctor was given i think
[01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:07.840]  250 000 over the course of his you know career speaking at these big farm events everything
[01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:12.800]  like that but anyway back in the day when i went to that guy it's this whole system now
[01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:16.880]  where if someone asks a question they're sent out of the classroom sent to the doctor drugged up
[01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:20.880]  and then they're not an issue anymore it's the dream of stall and hitler and mal and we finally
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:26.720]  come here and that's why apathy is the key to all this how they control us if we're not apathetic
[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:31.360]  we get and get out and actually care about things that's how they you know will lose that's also
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:35.680]  ties into this political correct agenda that we're going to get into specifically and how the
[01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:40.320]  political correct agenda is using you know major suppression on an intellectual level
[01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:44.240]  to make sure that we only bow down to the things that the system needs appropriate
[01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:49.120]  and that's why for example we're going to get into this waitress who said she was she was
[01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:52.960]  persecuted because you know she was homosexual and they didn't leave her a tip and they wrote
[01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:56.800]  all these nasty things it turns out that's completely false the people that went there
[01:17:56.800 --> 01:18:02.880]  actually have the receipt and they voted against christie because he didn't support gay marriage
[01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:07.440]  no i mean this is how this is working now and the system was just all over that saying yeah it's
[01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:12.800]  those crazy right wing extremists that do that kind of stuff but then it's like if a normal you
[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:17.360]  know a normal waiter or waitress didn't get a tip then it doesn't matter right this is all feeding
[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:21.520]  into this weird system where little things matter and the big things don't matter and if you care
[01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:25.600]  about the big things then you're insane well they have a they have a carefully constructed
[01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:30.720]  narrative an agenda that they want to put out and they create a narrative and whether or not
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:34.400]  it's real or whether or not it's funny in most cases they're making this up that's what we see
[01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:39.440]  over and over again when we look at these quote-unquote conspiracies we look at what's actually
[01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:43.440]  being told to us by the government we look at it and say you know this doesn't make any sense
[01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:48.880]  they've also got an agenda here just like the spy in the bag right you know am i he works for
[01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:53.760]  mi6 and they have some connections to him and there's a lot of issues there where they're
[01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:58.960]  not looking to see where this guy is he doesn't report for a week in that bag right i lock himself
[01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:03.280]  so you have to look at this you have to say maybe they've got a motive i mean if you were doing
[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:08.080]  an honest murder investigation you would look at people that were close by you would look at people
[01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:12.560]  who had a motive and you would honestly look at the facts and the government never does that
[01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:17.280]  and they do that with the social issues as well just like this case you just mentioned they've
[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:20.880]  got a narrative they want to put it out there as soon as they see something that fits that template
[01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:24.640]  they will run with it they will push it they want to investigate whether or not that's true or not
[01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:29.200]  exactly and that's you know speaking to some of the largest entrepreneurs in the website field
[01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:34.720]  they say the best website you can possibly get is user-generated content you give them the template
[01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:38.640]  and they make you the money the government is doing that on a large scale they're making us
[01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:43.040]  push their agenda for them and we can choose to opt out of it that's right well we're going to be
[01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:47.200]  right back after the break with anthony gucciardi and we're going to be taking some of your calls
[01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:50.400]  about some of these very issues if you want to talk to us about things that you've seen things
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:55.120]  that you've seen about the police state happening in your area things about how the government
[01:19:55.120 --> 01:20:00.240]  is creating this narrative this phony agenda and being joined by the press call us we'll be right back

[01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:27.680]  this crazy situation with more than 20 14-year-old boys are diagnosed with ADHD that's not the crazy
[01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:33.760]  part the crazy part is how they're medicating them with ritalin which is really related to cocaine
[01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:39.440]  in terms of the way that it acts basically creating a dependency of of drugs and dumbing them down
[01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:44.400]  that's one level of it but you were pointing out a level that was completely that was that was above
[01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:49.520]  it in terms of what this is all about in the ultimately right exactly well we could get
[01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:54.240]  into the fact that legal drugs kill more than cocaine and heroin combined where people are on
[01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:59.360]  pain killers and those drugs statistically it's more dangerous to be on the legal drugs than most
[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:04.080]  of the illegal drugs and you you'll find that the doctors are handing them out like candy and
[01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:08.480]  sometimes they know sometimes they don't know what they're doing yes but yes overall as i was
[01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:13.440]  saying before the whole entire system of control is to put us on these drugs the ones that step out
[01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:19.040]  of line because you know let's say 30 of people have unwavering you know they will never question
[01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:24.480]  the government then let's say 10 of the population is this really powerful intellectual you know
[01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:30.880]  supernova that can really change the world those people are the number one enemies that's right
[01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:35.280]  elite and the new order at home you want to get the kids that have got the most energy the go-getters
[01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:39.120]  the self-starters the people who would be the entrepreneurs in the future you want to get
[01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:44.800]  them on a pacifying drug and get them hooked to it and as i said i've been on them before i know
[01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:50.000]  what it feels like literally walking around like a zombie and i i told my mother at the time i said
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:54.400]  i can't take these and she said well the doctor says it's good for you you know because the doctor
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:59.520]  said he read my questions and answers for the eight top you know eight questions are you crazy or
[01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:04.160]  whatever an add and the teachers were flattered because you know i would sit there and i felt
[01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:08.560]  like i was ready to go to bed i felt like i had a bad cold i just felt terrible like a total mind
[01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:13.840]  block couldn't even put sentences together at the time that's right and i started not taking them and
[01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:18.560]  just hiding them around the house and stuff because i didn't want to take them and years later you know
[01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:24.320]  my my mom said oh my god thank god you didn't take those those pills i've seen when it's done to
[01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:29.200]  kids now they're giving them to like four-year-olds now well you have to at some point it's a difficult
[01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:34.480]  transition but people have to learn how to live in the real world the best you could say about the
[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:38.640]  drugs would be that they're going to take this transition this learning process and kick it
[01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:42.640]  down the road and at some point you're either going to stay on drugs your entire life to make
[01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:47.680]  you pacified or you're going to know they've known since the 80s though that it's fueling suicides
[01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:51.600]  and depression they know it's horrible that's right they they said i'm talking more to the parents
[01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:55.440]  now here i'm saying you know i get it parents you need to understand that your children if they've
[01:26:55.440 --> 01:27:00.960]  got a personality issue don't treat it with medication treat it with training or use this but
[01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:06.640]  use this time while they still are children to try to learn how to live in society and get along
[01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:13.040]  with other people or maybe look at the fact that in 2005 bbc harvard psychiatrists came out and said
[01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:17.440]  the human population being are being treated like guinea pigs human guinea pigs by taking prozac
[01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:21.440]  because elie lily knew since the 1980s they covered up he was part of he knew all about it
[01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:25.040]  they cherry picked the data said it was safe it actually made every single thing that was supposed
[01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:29.280]  to treat worse and that's across the board every single one of them you know all the major futures
[01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:33.840]  are on them the kids don't need this you know they need some kind of help if they actually
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:38.240]  have a serious mental illness but add oftentimes it's just not even a real thing you know people
[01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:42.240]  are just coming out and saying hey you know what's i don't believe that piece of history
[01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:46.160]  and you know teacher whatever and there's like you have add it's all a complete scam to get rid
[01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:50.240]  of that 10 of the people that will actually dominate and destroy the system people need to do their
[01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:55.440]  own homework they need to question the authority of the doctor of the pharmaceutical company they
[01:27:55.440 --> 01:28:00.000]  need to look at it and the information is there now online you can see what these things do you
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:04.480]  can see the articles that people have written you can understand what it is make the determination
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:09.360]  yourself it's not you know don't just read what's on the label but also read what the history of this
[01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:14.160]  is you want to reclaim your health naturally yes you know i as the creator of the third largest
[01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:17.920]  natural health website in the world i've gotten thousands of emails from people that were on
[01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:22.320]  these things or putting their kids on these i said oh my god you know it could be any herb or
[01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:26.320]  anything i've been taking you know whatever i've been cleansing my body i've been using the sideline
[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:31.040]  oh my god i can't believe the difference all those are real because they were on these these these
[01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:37.600]  pain inducing this this sleep inducing you know concoction by illy lillier whoever and they were
[01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:40.960]  just in this fog and they didn't realize that they didn't even have to feel like that anymore
[01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:44.880]  because they were on it for so many years there's people even taking those for 10 years they can't
[01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:48.560]  imagine life without it and those are the people unfortunately that go ahead and they you know they
[01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:52.080]  don't even watch the news they don't care about anything they hear about the NSA spying on them
[01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:55.840]  and they say you know whatever and it's the same thing they're putting the drugs and the
[01:28:55.840 --> 01:28:59.920]  drugs are already in the water supply they're putting biopharmaceutical crops now planting
[01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:05.440]  those yes all complete assault on the mind this is the extent that you can't it's very difficult
[01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:09.200]  for you to opt out of it you have to educate yourself and you have to be very deliberate
[01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:15.600]  to get out of this medication system because it's so pervasive it finds its way into the water supply
[01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:19.440]  so you have to get it exactly you've got to get something like a you know appropriate filter

[01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:50.240]  welcome back to the alex joe show i'm david night filling in for alex and i'm joined here in studio
[01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:57.520]  with anthony gucciardi of story leak and we were just talking about more than 20 of the people who
[01:33:57.520 --> 01:34:02.960]  were 14 year old boys according to the cdc have been diagnosed with adhd and of course they're
[01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:08.400]  being heavily medicated with riddolin and this is as anthony pointed out in the last segment this
[01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:14.320]  is like taking the most energetic the most focused the most people who are going to be the entrepreneurs
[01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:19.600]  in the next generation this is taking them and essentially taking the edge off of these kids
[01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:25.840]  kind of dumbing them down pacifying them putting them in a mental fog just so that they will
[01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:31.280]  ostensibly to behave in the classroom but there's something far broader than that a far deeper
[01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:35.760]  agenda isn't there anthony that's what we were talking about absolutely as i said before there's
[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:40.640]  probably about 10 of the population that's destined for greatness to struggle against the system that
[01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:45.840]  currently is you know active right now the nsa the tsa 10 of people i would say on average maybe a
[01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:52.240]  little bit more and ultimately it is the goal there's no question of big pharma and the elite
[01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:57.040]  to go ahead and drug up the people that would cause problems because after all they could hurt
[01:34:57.040 --> 01:35:01.600]  their profit margins they could hurt the overall goals and agendas of the establishment absolutely
[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:06.160]  and those 10 percent are the ones that are being heavily medicated along with maybe you know 10
[01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:11.600]  15 other percentages of individuals because the doctors are profit driven big pharma is profit
[01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:16.880]  driven it's ultimately what here's how the system works they will spin something that they want the
[01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:23.520]  establishment will create a a market for something and then give a profit driven incentive for others
[01:35:23.520 --> 01:35:28.000]  to go ahead and do it like i was talking about earlier to give you a really good example web
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:32.480]  entrepreneurs you know website developers and people who are launching their own organizations
[01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:38.480]  online they have told me time and time again i know this to be true user driven websites where
[01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:42.400]  the users make their own content and you know write their own stories or post their own stuff
[01:35:42.400 --> 01:35:47.600]  is the number one key to having a successful website where you you don't have to do much
[01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:52.560]  you know you sit back and relax and it generates income that is actually what the establishment's
[01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:57.120]  model is for this country they will go ahead and yes they control the media and everything
[01:35:57.120 --> 01:36:04.000]  like that but we are actually doing what they want if we are operating you know in a capacity where
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:09.280]  we don't understand their model for example you know the politically correct agenda when we actually
[01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:15.040]  bow down to these people and pretend we're morons and say oh my god you know i can't believe that
[01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:19.120]  you know that waitress wasn't given a tip because she was homosexual and not care about you know
[01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:23.920]  anything else we are playing into their model or when we go ahead and we say oh my god i have to
[01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:28.720]  get amily probed by the police officers because this is the right thing to do we're playing into
[01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:33.920]  their agenda and we're all going along with that unless we're you know oppositionally and intellectually
[01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:38.240]  going against it and every time you see these stories about police abuse we mentioned these
[01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:46.960]  stories about a prison situation where they sprayed a lady's vagina with mace as punishment
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:52.400]  you never see any punishment of the people who are perpetrating these crimes because they're
[01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:57.200]  officially working for the state and then of course the media comes in and covers for them and says
[01:36:57.760 --> 01:37:02.960]  oh but we need to be protected we need to have the tsa down our pants because al qaeda is such a
[01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:09.600]  threat when we've got the documents from a lawsuit showing that in mid 2011 they were writing internally
[01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:14.240]  that they knew there was no terrorist threat they knew the terrorists are simply propagandizing
[01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:19.440]  fundraising and recruiting which is exactly what the tsa and homeland security are about
[01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:25.280]  just a few days ago in dallas at the 50th anniversary of the jfk assassination you were there i mean
[01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:30.800]  you i was watching there you were putting on i was virtually there sorry sorry uh we were literally
[01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:36.640]  attacked by the sheriff's office federal federalized police and there are some good articles like
[01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:40.160]  we're going to talk about the washington times there's a caller calling about it but overall
[01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:45.040]  they were saying the police were being you know assaulted by protesters we were literally standing
[01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:48.080]  there saying hey can we get past this barricade that you guys said we could get past and they
[01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:53.440]  started just punching us we have it on video pushing people kids and everything it's going
[01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:59.760]  totally insane like totally third world level insane and the media covered up for them and
[01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:04.960]  said we started and alex jones alex jones was yelling at them and and provoking them we're
[01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:08.640]  just standing there saying hey can we get past the barricades now yeah absolutely well let's go
[01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:11.840]  to a couple of callers did call him before we get back to we've got a couple of callers who
[01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:16.800]  wanted to talk about their child in the classroom what we were talking about with a ad and with
[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:21.440]  ritalin but since we mentioned the jfk we had a couple of callers who called in about that let's
[01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:27.040]  go to allen in florida he said that he saw the article that uh was about info wars in the washington
[01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:32.800]  times allen are you there oh yeah good afternoon this is allen i'm actually uh the one that uh
[01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:39.360]  wrote an article in the uh washington times communities the reason i wrote it was i was
[01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:46.480]  watching the live stream and i was just floored when i saw what happened uh but i was even more
[01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:54.000]  astounded when i saw the failure of the media to respond and report on it so i've published a follow
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:39:01.760]  up article yesterday it's called media silence after deputies attacked journalists protesters you
[01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:09.600]  can find it uh on google news and basically i make the argument that the reason the mainstream
[01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:17.200]  media is not covering this incident that happened in dili plaza is they don't want to attract attention
[01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:23.680]  to the message of the protesters to the message of info wars of we are change of the others that
[01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:28.800]  were there therefore they're just ignoring it but it's at their own peril because if the
[01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:34.880]  journalists don't stick together if we don't hang together we hang separately as you often say
[01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:41.760]  absolutely i'm absolutely amazed to see the media and dallas not concerned about free
[01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:46.480]  speech issues i'm amazed to see that they were going to just basically take a powder on this
[01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:52.480]  and it got worse than that not only did they not complain about this zone of silence they
[01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:56.720]  actually criticized anybody who complained about it i mean it's even another level deeper than
[01:39:56.720 --> 01:40:01.760]  that it's bad enough when you have these political conventions and they you're both democrat and
[01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:08.800]  republican and they take the protesters and they put them literally in pens far far away from the
[01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:15.600]  convention and to to then have the press go and attack those people as opposed to attacking the
[01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:20.000]  people who are putting free speech in a in a pen that's the amazing thing to me and that's coming
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:24.800]  from the press there's no question as we talked about live at the actual event global wires now
[01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:30.880]  are coming to me and saying one of the main guys saying that yeah we're told to totally smear you
[01:40:30.880 --> 01:40:35.120]  guys and talk about how crazy you conspiracy theorists are but hey i'm actually with you guys
[01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:39.360]  and he was saying i can't believe this insanity so we know on record journalists have said and
[01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:44.320]  told alex time and time again they are out you know from their superiors to get us but they
[01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:48.720]  actually sometimes realize that hey we're actually telling the truth and on the right side of history
[01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:53.600]  right now so that's what going for i want to ask alan do you think anyone really believes
[01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:58.400]  the other mainstream pieces where they say that we were just uh for you know assaulting officers
[01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:05.120]  and they were just defending themselves do that i looked at some of the comments and i don't think
[01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:10.240]  people are giving a lot of credibility to their side of the story and the video speaks for itself
[01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:15.520]  yes no absolutely that's the key if people will look at it but you know what i've seen so often
[01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:20.720]  is people who are not really paying attention to politics or what's going on around them and
[01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:25.760]  they're just focused on football games or on pop culture they just see this and there's a passing
[01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:30.080]  story and it's like oh yeah a bunch of crazy protesters yeah a bunch of crazy protesters
[01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:34.480]  got stomped they deserve that yeah that's exactly right that's how they're controlling us because
[01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:38.400]  if everyone knew actually what was happening then we have a revolution tomorrow that's right it's the
[01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:45.040]  state of apathy they try and keep us in that's why people with big voices people with charisma
[01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:49.280]  and people with passion and dedication are the biggest threat to the establishment that's right
[01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:53.120]  thank you alan that was a great article it's very informative people can find it we've had it
[01:41:53.120 --> 01:41:56.800]  up on the screen here for people who are watching they can see the headline give us that headline one
[01:41:56.800 --> 01:42:07.120]  more time okay he's gone media silence as your deputies attack journalists thank you and we've
[01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:10.880]  got philip in california he had a quick comment about jfk and then we're going to get back to our
[01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:18.160]  subject of 14 year olds and drugs in school philip you wanted to say something about the jfk event
[01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:26.160]  yeah definitely uh i watched it uh i uh know that there were people that were denied permits
[01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:32.720]  i am fully aware that they were acting like bullies and uh and you rightfully describe them as
[01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:39.600]  bullies uh check this out okay what they want at these illegal perimeters what the police want
[01:42:40.160 --> 01:42:45.920]  is for you to stand down the whole time for them to ceremoniously like pull down those
[01:42:45.920 --> 01:42:51.440]  guardrails and stuff and they don't want you crossing until either regular traffic crosses
[01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:57.760]  or until uh like they're completely gone and like within a safe distance away from whatever might be
[01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:02.160]  happening or whatever to assert their dominance that's right and and that's what we wanted is us
[01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:05.840]  to punch back when they were punching us because then they could really have yes they'd probably
[01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:09.840]  take their guns out and shoot us at that point exactly i mean just like this this young kid and
[01:43:09.840 --> 01:43:16.240]  Bastrop who was tasered because he the way he looked at the cops that's their quote they tasered
[01:43:16.240 --> 01:43:22.000]  this kid he falls on the concrete floor cracks his head he's in a coma may die and what was his crime
[01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:26.320]  the way he looked at the police that's the way they're establishing their authority now it's
[01:43:26.320 --> 01:43:30.880]  absolutely authoritarian if we actually fought back which you know at a primal level you feel like
[01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:34.720]  you should you know intellectually you don't but when the police are pushing you and punching
[01:43:34.720 --> 01:43:38.400]  you in the kidneys over and over again you know you feel like you should actually do something about
[01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:44.080]  it if we did they probably would have just beat us to a pulp or shot somebody well and the headline
[01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:49.600]  would have been would have been police respond to conspiracy theory provocation or something
[01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:54.800]  something like that police defend against rabid conspiracy theories and then they would be like
[01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:58.720]  conspiracy theories assaulted police officers especially they're just punching us and pushing
[01:43:58.720 --> 01:44:04.080]  us more like hey stop that you have to you have to use asymmetric warfare it's like the american
[01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:08.560]  revolution right where they had their victories is when they use guerrilla tactics not when they
[01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:13.120]  lined up and marched straight ahead in the way that the british were fighting if you use their
[01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:17.040]  tactics whether you're talking about a real war whether you're talking about an information war
[01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:21.680]  if you use their tactics you're basically going to lose especially if it's you're talking about
[01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:26.320]  something that's physical because they dominate the physical situation right now that's taking
[01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:29.680]  it intellectually i mean yes actually we're just being punched in the kidneys over and over again
[01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:33.040]  as well and that's right and we're just sitting there just getting punched over and over and
[01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:38.000]  we're saying hey stop punching me you know at a proverbial level and fighting back but as long
[01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:42.240]  as we have the internet and we can communicate with people there were a million people watching
[01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:47.440]  that happen live a lot more people watching on the feed a lot more people have seen it afterwards
[01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:52.560]  they have to get control of the information flow and that's what they're trying to do now
[01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:57.360]  you know the ndaa they're loading that up with amendments they've got 507 amendments offered
[01:44:57.360 --> 01:45:05.280]  but to piggyback onto this thing but the one that really concerns me of many is uh this one from
[01:45:05.280 --> 01:45:11.280]  Rockefeller and he's trying to put syspa in the ndaa and that's what they want to do that's their
[01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:17.360]  number one priority is to have an excuse to shut down the internet to bully people the way that
[01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:21.200]  they're bullying them in the physical world that's what they want to do on the internet and they're
[01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:25.840]  going to use syspa to do that but let's get back to what we were just talking about with the adhd
[01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:30.400]  and the cd really the state of control it all ties into this the police aren't you know actively in
[01:45:30.400 --> 01:45:35.440]  the state of control as well working through the system everyone that's allowing ourselves to intellectually
[01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:39.920]  be beaten and punched in the kidneys over and over again are you know in the state of of control
[01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:43.920]  and the pharmaceutical drugging of the children is making sure they don't grow up to be that 10
[01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:47.600]  percent of people that fight and rally against the system and and grab you know hundreds of
[01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:51.440]  thousands of millions of people to fight alongside them yeah so we're going to talk you know specifically
[01:45:51.440 --> 01:45:56.240]  about how to escape that system and i'd like to hear from people that were on the drugs and how
[01:45:56.240 --> 01:46:00.160]  they feel and how they got out of off of them thank you philip in california let's go to uh
[01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:05.840]  steven california he says he has a child in the classroom steve just checked my webs
[01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:15.120]  oh you steve you there uh yeah hello hello go ahead yeah this is d yeah hello yes go ahead you're on
[01:46:15.120 --> 01:46:22.000]  the air sorry about that no problem about my son at eight years old he was having attention problems
[01:46:22.800 --> 01:46:31.840]  and we took him to a psychiatrist and he said he got age he has a g8 age a phd so knowing and
[01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:37.120]  listening to alex for over 10 years and knowing what the school system does knowing what drugs do
[01:46:37.120 --> 01:46:43.840]  we decided he's an eight-year-old boy he's got a lot of energy yes he's got a lot of downtime
[01:46:43.840 --> 01:46:53.360]  so no drugs now he's 13 and a half getting a's and b's and what they have done with the school system
[01:46:53.360 --> 01:47:00.400]  after reading a book dumbing us down by john gato gato as a teacher of the year it's that
[01:47:02.480 --> 01:47:09.040]  with his focus now they're not having recess in school they're eating heavily fat and sugared
[01:47:09.040 --> 01:47:14.880]  food so their brain is not getting the nutrition so that slows them down and makes them obese
[01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:22.880]  i cook all his food for him so he has plenty of energy and he gets a's and b's now adding to that
[01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:28.960]  a counselor that i know in new jersey was mentioning in middle school that she would get
[01:47:28.960 --> 01:47:34.960]  these boys that come in all bouncy and everything in the morning after their 11 o'clock dosing
[01:47:34.960 --> 01:47:42.320]  that they gave at the school they would walk around like zombies yeah and probably in the morning
[01:47:42.320 --> 01:47:47.200]  they were maybe bouncing around because of the high carbs and sugar that they just spent 11 o'clock
[01:47:47.200 --> 01:47:50.560]  dosing like a time where all the kids go and they take their prescription yeah were they shooting
[01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:55.760]  them there at the school they're giving them medications at school but here's another situation
[01:47:55.760 --> 01:48:02.240]  about my son and his assumed behavior that he was disruptive in class and chewing in class
[01:48:02.240 --> 01:48:08.320]  the teacher wrote him up a disciplinary action my son was sucking on a lozenge he wasn't chewing it
[01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:15.040]  so he is being honest she asked him and she wrote down on the disciplinary paper that my son he was
[01:48:15.040 --> 01:48:20.960]  eaten during class so when they said your son had ADHD though what did what specifically did they
[01:48:20.960 --> 01:48:25.120]  tell you that he needed medication and referred you to a doctor that he needed he needed medication
[01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:30.080]  that we should try him on different things and my wife who's an occupational therapist we said
[01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:37.520]  no i said all kids all boys have a lot of energy and are moody and they just go through phases
[01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:41.200]  well most parents would have done it they would have just dosed up their kids right with 50 different
[01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:45.440]  drugs if the if the teacher told them to because the teacher is a total medical professional thank
[01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:49.920]  you for sharing that steve people need parents need to hear that talking about the 11 o'clock
[01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:54.480]  being medication time it would they have like nurse ratchet come on to the intercom and and
[01:48:55.440 --> 01:48:59.680]  sounds like a trough of just pills and the kids would medication time medication time you know
[01:48:59.680 --> 01:49:04.000]  they all line up and get their their cups with pills on it at just like one flow of the cuckoo's
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:10.080]  nest yeah um damien and south carolina you had experience with schools and drugs as well i think
[01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:16.000]  that you want to talk about good afternoon gentlemen hey how are you going fine what you got
[01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:22.800]  i've got two children both boys one has autism and Tourette the other one has Tourette the older
[01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:29.280]  one from the moment he started having issues that is a younger child they want to put them on drugs
[01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:35.840]  and we didn't do it and he's doing fine now at 17 in high school and the younger one who does not
[01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:42.560]  have ADHD or autism but he does have Tourette's which makes him twitch and um a bit of a distraction
[01:49:42.560 --> 01:49:48.000]  in the class they want to medicate him but we wouldn't do it and he gets straight A's in school
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:55.680]  but um what we're seeing now is that he is um he's he's really smart and he speaks his mind
[01:49:55.680 --> 01:50:01.600]  both to the teachers and to his classmates and that um it's been causing issues for him as far as
[01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:09.280]  um you know kids targeting him for uh you know literally assaults and attacks because he doesn't
[01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:12.880]  he doesn't tell the line as far as you know the social engineering program and our public
[01:50:12.880 --> 01:50:18.640]  schools is going and he's been assaulted twice now in school and each time he stood up for himself
[01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:23.200]  and he gets suspended along with the kid who assaults him because the disciplinary policy now
[01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:28.880]  on our school district is if you um Damien hang on we're going to be coming right back from the
[01:50:28.880 --> 01:50:33.840]  break we'll continue with your call we'll be right back we're talking about the effect
[01:50:33.840 --> 01:50:39.360]  of medication in school and really what's behind all of this the bigger picture and this all started
[01:50:39.360 --> 01:50:44.640]  from this new revelation from the CDC that 20 percent of 14 year olds are now diagnosed and
[01:50:44.640 --> 01:50:56.880]  medicated for ADHD will be right back

[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:27.920]  in schools and we're just talking to damien in south carolina his two sons had autism and Tourette's
[01:54:28.560 --> 01:54:33.840]  he kept them off of medication and now much later they're thriving except for the bullies
[01:54:33.840 --> 01:54:40.240]  there uh have they diagnosed those bullies with anything giving them any medication damien it's
[01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:45.760]  funny as i was touching upon before the break the policy they have um it's really just completely
[01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:53.200]  shocking not shocking that i'm surprised but just shocking that um you know if you are in a fight
[01:54:53.200 --> 01:54:57.680]  you get suspended and it doesn't matter if you were just standing there minding your own business
[01:54:57.680 --> 01:55:02.160]  and someone jumps on you and starts pounding on you if you defend yourself you're complicit in the
[01:55:02.160 --> 01:55:10.720]  entire violation because you've raised your hand to defend yourself um and so my son uh one of the
[01:55:10.720 --> 01:55:14.000]  times he was targeted the kid was making fun of him because of his threats and he told him to
[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:18.160]  shut up and leave him alone and then the kid grabbed him and then my son was able to fight him off
[01:55:18.160 --> 01:55:22.480]  but the teacher just saw the two of them fighting so they don't even bother now to find out it's an
[01:55:22.480 --> 01:55:27.760]  amazing absolutely it's an amazing control grid isn't it i mean it's just the way that they
[01:55:28.400 --> 01:55:34.320]  indoctrinate the kids medicate the kids it's a system that was set up in the 1850s thank you damien
[01:55:34.320 --> 01:55:39.280]  we're gonna uh we got a couple other calls that we want to get to but i wanted to go to some of
[01:55:39.280 --> 01:55:44.000]  these we've got to do a product placement here is how we fund our operation and i just wanted to
[01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:47.680]  talk to anthony about some of the new stuff that's coming out because he's got the scoop on
[01:55:48.320 --> 01:55:55.840]  this coffee that alex is starting to sell which is amazing coffee my whole thing is as the head of
[01:55:55.840 --> 01:56:00.720]  the three in a natural society third largest natural health site in the world i don't ever
[01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:05.280]  really do you know plugs or anything like that unless i really believe in the product and i can
[01:56:05.280 --> 01:56:10.320]  honestly say i was there from the creation of this coffee you know when he was he was brewing up the
[01:56:10.320 --> 01:56:15.200]  idea when he was looking for the best ones actually examining the beans testing like 50 different
[01:56:15.200 --> 01:56:19.840]  batches you were there too drinking oh yeah i don't even drink coffee but this stuff is actually good
[01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:23.760]  yeah and i know i'm getting health benefits from it too and i know that the research is out there
[01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:27.920]  that you know coffee on average is a good thing for your body yes i've read it time and time again
[01:56:27.920 --> 01:56:31.760]  i've actually tried to start drinking coffee and i've had problems because you know you go to an
[01:56:31.760 --> 01:56:36.080]  actual run-of-the-mill coffee place and the coffee is in my opinion disgusting you don't know if it's
[01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:40.320]  gmo you don't know if there's pesticides you don't know what kind of fertilizer they've been using
[01:56:40.320 --> 01:56:44.960]  that's right you don't know any of that stuff and i do actually know where this is coming from
[01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:50.000]  and at the same time you know it's called the patreon blend the reality is when you are drinking it
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:53.920]  you are actually waking up others supporting the operation because i've seen you know i've seen
[01:56:53.920 --> 01:56:59.200]  what alex has to do just the jfk thing was major expenditures getting out there bringing the crew
[01:56:59.200 --> 01:57:03.360]  there getting the rooms you know the actually inexpensive you know all that stuff was super
[01:57:03.360 --> 01:57:09.680]  inexpensive in in relative terms because cbs you know nbc were there i talked to the guy one of the
[01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:15.120]  head of heads of cbs the logistics department in the bathroom and he had 45 people under him
[01:57:15.120 --> 01:57:18.960]  well they were all in one of the nicest hotels in the area well i mean you know we're just trying
[01:57:18.960 --> 01:57:23.360]  to catch up and and just completely blasting everyone out but it's just like what damien
[01:57:23.360 --> 01:57:27.600]  in south carolina was talking about and and the fellow before him steve in california
[01:57:27.600 --> 01:57:32.720]  who had their children in classrooms you need to take charge of your own life and take charge of
[01:57:32.720 --> 01:57:37.280]  your family's life think about what you're eating think about the supplements that you're taking
[01:57:37.280 --> 01:57:42.320]  i mean it's the iodine i mean that's that's a key thing people are not getting enough iodine it used
[01:57:42.320 --> 01:57:46.720]  to be put in as part of the bread they've taken that out used to be part of the baking process
[01:57:46.720 --> 01:57:51.600]  used to get a lot of iodine in that now you get zero from that unless you're eating a lot of seafood
[01:57:51.600 --> 01:57:56.960]  and shellfish and then you've got concerns about mercury contamination or radiation really actually
[01:57:56.960 --> 01:58:01.840]  have no idea you know to get into the depth of it would take hours dr group has formulated
[01:58:01.840 --> 01:58:07.760]  literally you know the best products i can find and with the iodine teaming up with him and you
[01:58:07.760 --> 01:58:12.160]  know delivering the best possible thing i just told you all fair that i was taking it i'm starting
[01:58:12.160 --> 01:58:17.280]  to feel kind of bad being out in 28 degree weather for 12 hours a day during the jfk protest i mean
[01:58:17.280 --> 01:58:21.840]  i'm taking the iodine that's what i go to take yeah that was pretty amazing i figured the entire
[01:58:21.840 --> 01:58:25.840]  crew was going to be sick when they came back but we're going to be right back jacari jackson's

[02:00:21.600 --> 02:00:29.840]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night filling in for alex we have an exciting
[02:00:29.840 --> 02:00:34.640]  show today i'm going to be joined in the next segment with jacari jackson and we're going to
[02:00:34.640 --> 02:00:40.240]  take your calls and discuss the news but this is a story that came out yesterday that i think is
[02:00:40.240 --> 02:00:46.800]  really important and it kind of gets to the heart of what's wrong with our country actually ran paul
[02:00:46.800 --> 02:00:52.240]  pointed it out with three bills that he had to read the bill write the bill and one subject at a time
[02:00:53.200 --> 02:00:59.440]  the ndaa has kind of been the catchall for every kind of tyranny that you can imagine especially
[02:00:59.440 --> 02:01:04.480]  the indefinite detention act has gotten the attention of everybody a couple years ago they
[02:01:04.480 --> 02:01:10.640]  threw that in and we understand the implications of that we understand the danger of that we
[02:01:10.640 --> 02:01:17.040]  understand the infrastructure of tyranny that's been built with that now we see that the senate is
[02:01:17.040 --> 02:01:22.160]  looking at 507 amendments that people are trying to stuff into this bill and this is the way they
[02:01:22.160 --> 02:01:28.480]  do it every time this is why ran paul had his uh one subject at a time where he said we're not
[02:01:28.480 --> 02:01:33.840]  going to take something that is ostensibly about funding the military and use that as a leverage to
[02:01:33.840 --> 02:01:39.120]  put in something about indefinite detention without trial by the military of american citizens
[02:01:39.120 --> 02:01:44.960]  assuming that because we've got a declaration of war in afghanistan or actually not even really
[02:01:44.960 --> 02:01:48.560]  an official declaration of war but it's an authorization for the use of military force
[02:01:48.560 --> 02:01:54.480]  in afghanistan they say now that they've got a war going on in america and because we've got a war
[02:01:54.480 --> 02:02:00.880]  going on in america therefore they can pick up anybody and detain them indefinitely in military
[02:02:00.880 --> 02:02:06.800]  facilities that's what they snuck into the ndaa two years ago a bill that was about authorizing
[02:02:06.800 --> 02:02:12.800]  defense appropriations now we see that this year we've got rockefella senator rockefella he's still
[02:02:12.800 --> 02:02:21.200]  alive and he's still doing his rockefella stuff trying to stuff into the ndaa 2014 bill a cyber
[02:02:21.200 --> 02:02:27.440]  security bill which is exactly what syspo was about and it says here in the rt article says if the
[02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:33.280]  amendment manages to stay intact as congress prepares to approve the authorization for 2014
[02:02:33.280 --> 02:02:40.480]  the cyber security act of 2013 which has been defeated over and over again may finally become law
[02:02:40.480 --> 02:02:44.240]  that's exactly the purpose and according to rockefella this is how he puts it out here we
[02:02:44.240 --> 02:02:51.760]  want to formalize cyber security as one of nests priority areas of focus in other words the government
[02:02:51.760 --> 02:02:58.000]  is going to focus on cyber security they're losing the info war they have to get control of the internet
[02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:02.560]  in the same way that they control the streets in dalas when they don't allow free speech the same
[02:03:02.560 --> 02:03:08.000]  way they control the streets of any city when they're having a major political convention they want
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:13.120]  to basically shut down free speech and to do that they're going to claim that it's in the name of
[02:03:13.120 --> 02:03:18.240]  cyber security because every time they rob you of your liberty they claim that they're making you
[02:03:18.240 --> 02:03:25.920]  safer no when you give up your liberty you get slavery not security slaves are never secure
[02:03:25.920 --> 02:03:30.880]  people who have given up their liberties are never secure you need to understand that it is not a
[02:03:30.880 --> 02:03:35.120]  trade-off between liberty and security but he's putting it out there he's saying we got to make
[02:03:35.120 --> 02:03:41.040]  that our number one priority we need to develop a set of voluntary cyber security standards for
[02:03:41.040 --> 02:03:46.960]  the critical infrastructure and he's joined in this it's being endorsed by at&t verizon
[02:03:46.960 --> 02:03:52.640]  motorola the electric and nuclear power coalition ibm and the us chamber of commerce now why are
[02:03:52.640 --> 02:03:57.600]  these big businesses getting behind this well one of the things that's going on you need to understand
[02:03:57.600 --> 02:04:02.800]  that whenever you give your information to facebook or you give it to the phone company
[02:04:02.800 --> 02:04:07.280]  and we're going to be talking to jacari jackson about what's exactly going on with facebook and
[02:04:07.280 --> 02:04:12.720]  and the facial recognition systems that are put into that but whenever you give up your information
[02:04:12.720 --> 02:04:18.720]  to a third party it's the government's position and i believe it's a legal fiction we need to address
[02:04:18.720 --> 02:04:24.080]  this directly it's their position that if a third party has information on you the government doesn't
[02:04:24.080 --> 02:04:28.560]  need to get a search warrant to get that information from the third party you've given it up legally
[02:04:28.560 --> 02:04:33.600]  to that third party the third party can just hand it over to you whenever they ask there are still
[02:04:33.600 --> 02:04:39.600]  some civil litigation issues if these third parties do that and that's what they're trying to protect
[02:04:39.600 --> 02:04:44.960]  against it's not that they're going to necessarily take new action they're looking at everybody's
[02:04:44.960 --> 02:04:51.040]  communication constantly now they're just trying to protect the big corporations and give themselves
[02:04:51.040 --> 02:04:55.200]  yet another excuse to shut people down we'll be right back with jacari jackson stay tuned
