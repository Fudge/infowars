[00:21.900 --> 00:27.840]  administration again. Clinton says the president has jeopardized national security and the
[00:27.840 --> 00:35.560]  ability to intervene in world crises because of the massive U.S. debt held partly by China.
[00:35.560 --> 00:41.440]  Democratic presidential hopeful claims the national debt of some $9 trillion puts the
[00:41.440 --> 00:47.200]  country at the mercy of many other nations. Clinton also says she is not stepping down
[00:47.200 --> 00:53.080]  the race. This is IRN USA radio news.
[00:53.080 --> 00:59.600]  My name is Michiko Walsh. I came here from Japan five years ago and I didn't know many
[00:59.600 --> 01:05.600]  people. I was scared to death to talk to a stranger, especially in English. I didn't
[01:05.600 --> 01:13.400]  know how to talk and how to find a job and I was so scared but I decided to do something
[01:13.400 --> 01:20.720]  and I started pre-step plan two years ago. I was amazed because it worked but all I did
[01:20.720 --> 01:26.840]  is just for the system. This has really made my experience in America much better and I
[01:26.840 --> 01:33.040]  met nice people and able to earn financial freedom so I appreciate everything and thank
[01:33.040 --> 01:34.040]  you very much.
[01:34.040 --> 01:38.000]  Hi, how in the world are you anyway? This is Andy Willoughby with the three-step plan
[01:38.000 --> 01:42.320]  home business system. To find out how you could make more money working from home go

[01:56.240 --> 02:00.000]  be in the mail. It's not every day that Americans look forward to hearing from the Internal
[02:00.000 --> 02:04.200]  Revenue Service but over the past few weeks many Americans have received a letter from
[02:04.200 --> 02:09.080]  the IRS with some good news. President Bush says the rebates coupled with the incentives
[02:09.080 --> 02:15.640]  to businesses will quote, help give our economy shot in the arm. The mortgage crisis also
[02:15.640 --> 02:20.520]  on the President's mind. He talked about a private sector program called the Hope Now
[02:20.520 --> 02:26.200]  Alliance that has been started to help struggling homeowners. Anti-communist activists from
[02:26.200 --> 02:31.880]  Orange County's Little Saigon neighborhood, leading on the University of Southern California
[02:31.880 --> 02:36.920]  to take down the flag of the People's Democratic Republic of Vietnam. It's part of a display
[02:36.920 --> 02:42.960]  of flags. Officials say if USC doesn't remove the flag or replace it with the red and yellow
[02:42.960 --> 02:47.600]  striped flag of the former government of South Vietnam, they'll be protest. The latest news

[02:50.600 --> 02:57.360]  Here's a word about Israel from Dr. Jack Hayford, President of the International Church of
[02:57.360 --> 02:58.360]  the Four Square Gospel.
[02:58.360 --> 03:03.800]  Go to Israel is to change the way you will ever approach the Bible. The Bible becomes
[03:03.800 --> 03:08.920]  based in an entirely deeper and richer way because you have been where it happened. You'll
[03:08.920 --> 03:14.000]  never be the same when you visit Israel. To start planning your trip to Israel today,
[03:14.000 --> 03:17.000]  visit www.goisrael.com.
[03:17.000 --> 03:30.000]  In Miami, a man is now in custody following a hostage incident at a drugstore today. Police
[03:30.000 --> 03:34.320]  captured the man after he crashed a getaway car. They already say the man was armed when
[03:34.320 --> 03:39.440]  he took the store manager hostage during an attempted robbery. The manager was able to
[03:39.440 --> 03:45.160]  escape before he could be forced into the car. The man did suffer minor injuries.
[03:45.160 --> 03:50.280]  With Pope Benedict set to arrive in New York next month, church officials are finding rather
[03:50.280 --> 03:54.080]  unique ways to honor him. Mike Watts explains.
[03:54.080 --> 03:57.520]  A planned gift from the Archdiocese of New York to Pope Benedict during the Ponups New
[03:57.520 --> 04:02.040]  York visit gives new meaning to the term holy roller. The Archdiocese is planning to present
[04:02.040 --> 04:06.280]  the Pope with a special skateboard with graphics designed by a local child. Dozens of young
[04:06.280 --> 04:09.800]  teens have entered a contest to design the skateboard, which church officials say will
[04:09.800 --> 04:13.640]  feature graphics with a religious theme. Officials say while skateboarding and the Pope don't
[04:13.640 --> 04:17.200]  go together in most people's minds, the church is using the contest to show that there is
[04:17.200 --> 04:21.840]  nothing ungodly about skateboarding and that the sport can be used to teach religious message.
[04:21.840 --> 04:23.040]  Mike Watts, New York.
[04:23.040 --> 04:28.760]  In Jacksonville, Florida, Dunkin' Donuts will offer free coffee to tax preparers and postal

[06:26.920 --> 06:35.000]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[06:35.000 --> 06:44.040]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us. It is already the March 30th, 2008 April
[06:44.040 --> 06:50.600]  Fool's Day. We're happily approaching everyone. We're gonna be live here for the next two hours.
[06:53.080 --> 07:01.480]  We have Yuki Hisa Fujita joining us coming up the start of the next hour. He is on Japan's
[07:01.480 --> 07:09.080]  National Security Council. He is also the leader of Japan's second-largest party,
[07:10.120 --> 07:18.120]  and he has had nationwide televised hearings in the Japanese Parliament concerning 9-11
[07:18.120 --> 07:22.360]  being an inside job. They played the clips of firefighters and police saying, get back.
[07:22.920 --> 07:28.520]  The government's going to blow up Building 7. Yeah, there's just a whole bunch of CNN, Fox,
[07:28.520 --> 07:32.120]  Clips where they say, we're going to blow up Building 7. We'll bring it down. The cops say,
[07:32.120 --> 07:38.360]  get back. We're blowing it up. And they say it fell on its own, 47-story building. And he goes
[07:38.360 --> 07:43.720]  through hours of that every month now on the Japanese diet and then at the higher council
[07:44.440 --> 07:51.080]  above that. And it's just coming out everywhere. We have one of the most respected and longest
[07:51.080 --> 07:59.640]  serving, the longest serving in the modern age since Mussolini served seven-plus years as
[07:59.640 --> 08:05.160]  Italy's president was the former head of their CIA. He's gone public saying that criminals
[08:05.160 --> 08:10.280]  running our government carried out the attacks. A bunch of former CIA section chiefs like Bill
[08:10.280 --> 08:15.320]  Christensen and others have gone public saying it's an inside job. But the media is very good
[08:15.320 --> 08:21.960]  at only giving an attention of some Hollywood person that they think that they can attack like...well,
[08:21.960 --> 08:26.760]  Oscar winner this year. She got Best Actress. She came out and talked about it. So they did focus
[08:26.760 --> 08:31.400]  on that in the media because she's foreign. She's French. She's a woman. They can try to demonize
[08:31.400 --> 08:39.000]  her. But Yuka Hisa Fujita will be on with us coming up for about 20 or 30 minutes in the
[08:39.560 --> 08:45.000]  second hour today. Jim Mars, former Fort Worth Star telegram reporter. He wrote the screenplay
[08:45.000 --> 08:54.760]  of the film JFK. He's going to be popping in. ABC News, BBC, NBC have come out with separate
[08:54.760 --> 09:04.040]  reports. The head of the National Forensics Society and then also one of the top doctorates
[09:04.040 --> 09:11.160]  in sound acoustics. They had a big symposium out in California a few weeks ago documenting
[09:11.160 --> 09:18.760]  how Sirhan Sirhan didn't shoot RFK, 40th anniversary coming up. But separately, the BBC
[09:19.640 --> 09:26.840]  just got the films analyzed showing four CIA operatives, one of them a section chief from Asia,
[09:27.480 --> 09:35.240]  there in the crowd. They've also analyzed the gun that was used to shoot Bobby in the back.
[09:35.240 --> 09:39.960]  Of course, we always knew this. The LA Coroner said that he was shot in the back at point blank
[09:39.960 --> 09:45.080]  powder burns not by the mental patient that they set up, Sirhan Sirhan. So that's coming up in
[09:45.080 --> 09:52.200]  about 20 minutes. Now, we'll take a few calls today, but I'm not taking many. So just understand
[09:52.200 --> 09:56.760]  that some shows we take nothing but call some shows we don't take many and today is one of those.
[09:56.760 --> 10:00.680]  So I don't know when we're going to get to you, but we will get to you because I've got a lot of
[10:00.680 --> 10:04.840]  news I want to cover while these two guests are on with us as well. So John and Florida and Moe
[10:04.840 --> 10:12.520]  and Oregon and Paul and Montana will get to you, but just be prepared to wait. Okay. Let me just
[10:12.520 --> 10:18.280]  give you the stacks of news I have here in front of me. China has been caught cloaking soldiers
[10:18.280 --> 10:22.920]  as monks to incite riots. British government is now saying that's even the case. We told you that
[10:22.920 --> 10:29.080]  about a week and a half ago. Also, airport security forces wanted to remove nipple ring with pliers
[10:29.080 --> 10:34.920]  and how that ties into other reports that we have like cops beat
[10:36.200 --> 10:41.800]  peaceful Tibetan protesters in America. How this is all training for the police state
[10:41.800 --> 10:47.080]  and how the elites are engaging in this training. Also, mobile phones more dangerous than smoking
[10:47.080 --> 10:52.600]  top government report, but people are going to continue their heavy use radiating in their
[10:52.600 --> 10:58.600]  brains. Also, Mukasey says the Attorney General terrorists behind copyright violations. They're
[10:58.600 --> 11:02.760]  saying that copyright violation of any type now will be terrorism and you won't get a
[11:02.760 --> 11:08.200]  bill of rights or constitution or due process. You can't make this stuff up. All misdemeanors
[11:08.200 --> 11:14.760]  under section 802 of the Patriot Act are terrorism. 10% of the college graduates going into homeland
[11:14.760 --> 11:20.920]  security isn't for real terrorism folks. It's to run your life is to have secret police everywhere.
[11:20.920 --> 11:27.000]  It's the new America. So we'll be going over some of that as well. And then I've got this report,
[11:27.000 --> 11:31.800]  this group of reports under siege and Baghdad's a muddy army stronghold.
[11:33.400 --> 11:38.760]  Areas of Baghdad fall to militias as Iraq army falters in Basra.
[11:41.640 --> 11:47.640]  Iraqi police in Basra shed their uniforms, kept their rifles and switched sides. Now,
[11:47.640 --> 11:50.520]  I was listening to fake conservative because they're not real conservative. They're
[11:50.520 --> 11:54.120]  there to neutralize real conservatives. So it's too late to the globalist agenda.
[11:54.120 --> 11:58.920]  I listened to some San Antonio radio and some national radio and it was Al Qaeda is attacking
[11:58.920 --> 12:08.360]  in Basra and Al Qaeda is attacking in Baghdad and that Al Qaeda backed by Iran is attacking
[12:08.360 --> 12:13.400]  the green zone. Now, I talk about this every week and it's finally getting some attention.
[12:13.400 --> 12:24.280]  Iran is Shiite. It is predominantly Shiites attacking the minority run Sunni government.
[12:24.920 --> 12:27.160]  Sunni is the group that Al Qaeda comes from.
[12:31.080 --> 12:35.080]  So when you listen to the news and you listen to McCain and I'm not saying vote for the
[12:35.080 --> 12:40.040]  Democrats either the point is they're all a pack of criminals. They talk to you like your
[12:40.040 --> 12:47.720]  two year old fools. So just find out where Iraq is on a map. Get a globe out or get a map out.
[12:47.720 --> 12:50.680]  Learn about the different branches of Islam. Learn about how they're at each other's
[12:50.680 --> 12:54.520]  throats and then watch the news and realize that they lie to you.
[12:55.720 --> 12:59.640]  Okay. Now, why did all this start? They were about to have fair elections again.
[12:59.640 --> 13:03.560]  It clearly showed that the Shiites were going to win. They can't have that.
[13:03.560 --> 13:11.400]  And so the Sunni started invading strongholds and they broke the ceasefire that had not the
[13:11.400 --> 13:16.840]  surge isn't what worked. The ceasefire a year and a half ago and by working it did cut back
[13:16.840 --> 13:24.440]  about 50% the violence against Iraqis and the troops on both sides. I see all three sides,
[13:24.440 --> 13:29.080]  the Iraqi government puppet troops, our troops and then the Shiites.
[13:29.080 --> 13:36.680]  So there was a ceasefire without solder and that is and that's admitted a week ago they
[13:36.680 --> 13:39.960]  rolled in there, started trying to get him, started trying to get others,
[13:39.960 --> 13:43.880]  started trying to take over Basra for no reason.
[13:45.800 --> 13:50.920]  And now all hell is broken loose. That way you can't have a real election and that way
[13:50.920 --> 13:52.440]  the people can't actually have their will.
[13:55.160 --> 13:57.400]  And now they've got an excuse to keep our troops there even longer.
[13:57.400 --> 14:01.400]  It's called the strategy of tension. When people get, you know, first they say we're
[14:01.400 --> 14:05.240]  going to Iraq for six weeks, then they say six months, then they say mission accomplished,
[14:05.880 --> 14:09.800]  then they say, oh, well, we've got to stop the violence, then they make deals and cut back on
[14:09.800 --> 14:14.680]  the violence, which is still just epidemic. Kind of having one leg saw it off and then,
[14:14.680 --> 14:17.880]  you know, they saw off the other and they turn it get one and say, well, you're okay.
[14:17.880 --> 14:21.880]  Both legs are sought off at a turk. It's on one. And then now they're going to say, oh,
[14:21.880 --> 14:24.360]  we got to stay forever because now the violence has started again.
[14:24.360 --> 14:28.600]  When you read the Pentagon plans and Israeli plans for more than a decade ago,
[14:28.600 --> 14:32.120]  they said split it in three parts, have the groups fight each other, and then set up
[14:32.120 --> 14:37.640]  military bases to project power into Iran. And then of course into Syria and surrounding areas.
[14:39.480 --> 14:45.080]  So that's the basics there. And now these vaunted brigades of troops trained by the U.S.
[14:45.080 --> 14:52.040]  and England have, are ordered to go in and attack their fellow Shiites and their fellow Iraqis.
[14:52.040 --> 14:57.160]  And they're laying their guns down. And I saw a London Guardian article calling them turncoach.
[14:59.480 --> 15:03.480]  No, they're not turncoach. They're with their people, with their religion.
[15:04.040 --> 15:08.520]  Would you expect Americans to do anything else? Again, the people running our government
[15:08.520 --> 15:12.680]  knowingly attacked them to get them to fight back because they don't want peace in the country.
[15:12.680 --> 15:17.560]  They want turmoil. That's the strategy. Now, the really big news when we get back.
[15:17.560 --> 15:23.560]  This is not Alex Jones, though I've talked a lot about this. I'm very thankful to see this in
[15:23.560 --> 15:29.080]  the New York Times. Asking the judge to save the world or more.
[15:29.080 --> 15:47.560]  When we get back, anti-matter weapons. Stay with us.
[15:47.560 --> 16:01.800]  It is a big idea. A New World Order. In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful
[16:01.800 --> 16:08.040]  world government. It's known as the Builder Bird. Could their objective be world domination?
[16:08.600 --> 16:14.680]  For thousands of years, their Dark Order grew. Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order,
[16:14.680 --> 16:19.160]  their great dream of exterminating 80 percent of humanity is at hand.
[16:22.120 --> 16:27.560]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide over.
[16:27.560 --> 16:31.400]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[16:31.400 --> 16:35.160]  Builder Bird is making great progress for the world government. Most people have no idea.
[16:35.160 --> 16:38.520]  They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. That's their
[16:38.520 --> 16:45.960]  after music. Order in-game on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com or watch it online right now

[17:08.200 --> 17:12.840]  Edge fund's cut in the malaise of mortgage bankruptcies. The bond market continues to slump.
[17:12.840 --> 17:18.280]  J.P. Morgan gets caught in a 10 billion bad deal for Chrysler. Housing sales fell 6.6 percent.
[17:18.280 --> 17:23.160]  Mortgage giant countrywide showed mortgage payment was spreading to the middle and upper class.
[17:23.160 --> 17:27.480]  Investors cast doubt on investment banks. Credit protection insurance for mortgage
[17:27.480 --> 17:32.200]  lenders are skyrocketing due to the increased risk. The U.S. dollar is free falling against
[17:32.200 --> 17:37.240]  foreign currencies in countries that previously financed the U.S. are now seeking safer alternatives.
[17:37.240 --> 17:41.400]  Economist Rody Boyd published the report bubble leaking. Call for the report today,

[17:52.120 --> 17:59.400]  7. My neighbor, they say the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Certainly we'd never
[17:59.400 --> 18:03.880]  intend to procrastinate getting our own food supply until there was none left at any price.
[18:03.880 --> 18:08.120]  We would intend to have plenty of food so the relief organizations could care for those unable
[18:08.120 --> 18:13.080]  to care for themselves. We would intend not to be standing in the bread line with the ignorant
[18:13.080 --> 18:18.200]  and the foolish who pretend the facts of food disappearance are untrue. If the experience
[18:18.200 --> 18:24.280]  of the Katrina disaster is evidence, the bread line may have no bread. Just like the good intentions
[18:24.280 --> 18:29.320]  on the road to that unheavenly place, the good intentions alone to get a supply of food will
[18:29.320 --> 18:34.760]  not feed us. Only getting our food supply immediately will make us independent and fearless for the
[18:34.760 --> 18:48.760]  future. Call 800-409-5633. 800-409-5633 on the web, eFoodsDirect.com. Who am I? Nobody. Steve

[20:12.680 --> 20:20.200]  I remember in college and I remember watching PBS and reading a few books by
[20:20.200 --> 20:27.400]  quantum mechanics and physicists about the danger of superconducting supercolliders.
[20:31.000 --> 20:38.680]  And there's a lot of other different devices and systems and they've had machines for 40 years
[20:38.680 --> 20:44.360]  that take the amount of power that Cincinnati was one example uses in a week to
[20:44.360 --> 20:52.440]  to change elements. They can change different metals into gold or they can create totally
[20:52.440 --> 20:57.160]  new elements. They've created a bunch of them. That's one example. I mean this science fiction
[20:57.160 --> 21:01.080]  stuff's been around 40 years. They were going to build a superconducting supercollider from
[21:01.080 --> 21:05.480]  Waukesha Hatchey down to Austin, Texas. And I remember at the time reading about it when it
[21:05.480 --> 21:10.680]  stalled in the mid 1990s. Actually when Bush Sr. left office in 93 he killed it.
[21:10.680 --> 21:16.200]  And they built a large part of it. Huge underground labyrinth up at Waukesha Hatchey.
[21:18.120 --> 21:27.240]  They built about a third of it and they shoot different particles of lead and uranium and
[21:27.240 --> 21:36.200]  plutonium and gold and other heavy elements at the speed of light into other elements or they
[21:36.200 --> 21:40.760]  accelerate them towards each other and these things cost hundreds of billions of dollars to build.
[21:40.760 --> 21:44.680]  The European Union built the biggest one. They've got a whole bunch of them here in the US
[21:45.800 --> 21:49.640]  and I'm going to get a bunch of top scientists and physicists on about this. Every time I mention
[21:49.640 --> 21:55.880]  this people email me and say man you're nuts. This is UFO stuff. Look I don't cover stuff that
[21:55.880 --> 22:02.360]  isn't documented. And all I know is the head of the British Royal Society, the most procedures in
[22:02.360 --> 22:07.640]  the world who's a physicist wrote a book 20 years ago saying this could easily destroy the planet
[22:07.640 --> 22:13.800]  or the solar system. There's a bunch of physicists that are now suing to block this new collider
[22:14.440 --> 22:22.680]  that the equations show that there is a possibility of basically any matter explosions is the simplest
[22:22.680 --> 22:28.280]  way to put it. But I thought instead of, I mean sometime this week, someday on the weekday show
[22:28.280 --> 22:36.280]  or maybe even tomorrow, in fact Trey, my producer is in there yesterday, I dug up one of these
[22:36.280 --> 22:40.680]  physicists who's suing number in Hawaii. I sent that to you. I want to get him on the next few
[22:40.680 --> 22:45.000]  days. We're going to have a bunch of them on and these are not quacks. These are highly respected
[22:45.000 --> 22:51.800]  physicists and they're saying that the equations are showing all sorts of problems. Now they're
[22:51.800 --> 22:57.240]  talking about it creating black holes and the same physicists and it's a large group of them have
[22:57.240 --> 23:05.400]  been saying this for any equations for 40 years, complaining for 20 lawsuits for well since 1990,
[23:05.400 --> 23:10.840]  they've been different groups have been filing suits. So that's 18 years and they said theoretically
[23:10.840 --> 23:17.800]  this shows that there's a probability if they do thousands of tests that you will get black holes.
[23:17.800 --> 23:23.160]  Well now they got black holes and the New York Times obviously didn't do its research on this.
[23:23.160 --> 23:27.240]  I mean they say it's a real threat but they say oh that's not going to make a black hole.
[23:27.240 --> 23:32.360]  They have the head of one of these colliders saying that's kooky. Well funny, already in similar
[23:32.360 --> 23:39.880]  colliders, national geographic black hole. A Brown University physicist has created a
[23:39.880 --> 23:48.840]  black hole and a particle accelerator. That's a national geographic. That was March 18, 2005.
[23:48.840 --> 23:55.000]  Here's Fox News. Scientists create artificial black hole in lab. Exactly what these physicists
[23:55.640 --> 24:04.520]  warned everybody about 20 years ago is what they're now doing. Now I've got LA Times here.
[24:04.520 --> 24:11.160]  Here's a San Francisco Chronicle. Air Force pursuing antimatter weapons. Program was touted
[24:11.160 --> 24:16.280]  publicly then official gag order came and it goes into this long article admitting that the Air Force
[24:16.280 --> 24:21.720]  seven years ago admitted they had already created antimatter weapons. Isolated them in these particle
[24:21.720 --> 24:27.640]  accelerators then they've got to hold them in these huge facilities with these different magnetic
[24:28.280 --> 24:33.560]  fields that take the power of a city literally just to hold it and then they go but don't worry
[24:33.560 --> 24:40.840]  they decay before they explode and then oh don't worry physicist Hawking's or Hawking
[24:40.840 --> 24:44.440]  he said that it would make black holes but that they would decay and break down.
[24:44.440 --> 24:50.840]  But he said that after these were developed. The physicists that predicted they would make
[24:50.840 --> 24:55.800]  black holes even by accident in these superconducting supercolliders predicted it and they laughed at
[24:55.800 --> 25:02.280]  them and then they made them. Now the problem is that they say well we're holding these black holes
[25:02.280 --> 25:07.560]  in these fields and so they're unable to get more matter to energize themselves and grow
[25:07.560 --> 25:13.560]  and so they decay and break up. You see if a black hole is able to start grabbing other
[25:13.560 --> 25:20.280]  particles around it its core gets smaller and denser and but don't worry if this happens you
[25:20.280 --> 25:27.000]  won't feel anything. You will be crushed into subatomic quarks and that's little subdivisions
[25:27.000 --> 25:33.320]  of atoms and sucked into a something smaller than a pinhead instantly. You will feel no pain
[25:33.320 --> 25:39.640]  no nothing just all the birds all the bees your boathouse your home grandma pictures of grandma
[25:39.640 --> 25:45.000]  it's all gone the whole planet everything gone solar system pulled in sun pulled in everything
[25:45.000 --> 25:50.600]  gone but that's only one of the hundreds of things that physicists have predicted that these
[25:50.600 --> 25:56.920]  would be able to create now they're creating them but don't worry you're worried about taking some
[25:56.920 --> 26:01.800]  farmers ranch the name of environmentalism or you're worried for some corrupt developer who
[26:01.800 --> 26:07.000]  runs the local environmental front group or you're worried about the ozone gases the carbon
[26:07.000 --> 26:14.200]  dioxide that plants breathe that humans exhale we've got to tax that or you know all these petty
[26:14.200 --> 26:18.040]  issues you're not worried about the genetic engineering the thousands of labs randomly
[26:18.040 --> 26:23.720]  cross-spicing different species huge mega viruses that have already gotten out all sorts of serious
[26:23.720 --> 26:28.120]  problems i've had double prize winners on about this i'm not giving you my opinion this is already
[26:28.120 --> 26:34.440]  happening you like one in 33 having cancer now it's one in three about three one and two
[26:34.440 --> 26:38.280]  you like everybody having diabetes all the stuff that's happening you like gmo food you like the
[26:38.280 --> 26:42.440]  fact that these gmo foods kill all the rats that eat it they still certify it and feed it to us
[26:42.440 --> 26:47.160]  we're a lot tougher than a rat folks but it's messing us up you like what sodium fluoride
[26:47.160 --> 26:52.840]  does your kidneys in your brain my point is the elites are out of their mind they've got to have
[26:52.840 --> 26:57.640]  this power they've got to be the ones that well whoever discovers it will have total control
[26:57.640 --> 27:02.040]  and whoever has the antimatter weapons whoever has the free energy we you know we have to do this
[27:02.040 --> 27:07.960]  us i don't know if atlantis existed but the you know the legend is is they created an energy
[27:07.960 --> 27:12.440]  system and we're playing with this type of stuff and it totally blew the continent to pieces
[27:12.440 --> 27:16.520]  in the middle of the atlantic ocean now i don't believe in stuff like that who knows if that was
[27:16.520 --> 27:22.680]  true the point is we're coming up to some torps some some type of atlantean disaster here with
[27:22.680 --> 27:27.800]  the with the genetic engineering with the uh with what they're doing in superconducting
[27:27.800 --> 27:33.080]  supercolliders and that's only one class of these laboratories there's literally hundreds of these
[27:33.080 --> 27:40.120]  things air force pursuing antimatter weapons program was touted publicly then came official
[27:40.120 --> 27:46.200]  gag order but before i get into that let me just reach the new york times from friday asking a judge
[27:46.200 --> 27:52.520]  to save the world or more more fighting in iraq somalia and chaos people in this country can't
[27:52.520 --> 27:57.640]  afford their mortgages and in some places now they can't even afford rice none of this
[27:57.640 --> 28:02.920]  nor the rest of the grimness on the front page today will matter a bit though if the two men
[28:02.920 --> 28:08.040]  pursuing a lawsuit in federal court in hawaii turn out to be right they think a giant particle
[28:08.040 --> 28:12.760]  accelerator will begin smashing protons together outside geneva this summer might produce a black
[28:12.760 --> 28:17.720]  hole or something else that will spell the end of earth and maybe the universe and it goes on to
[28:17.720 --> 28:23.560]  say that a lot of top scientists agree with them we'll finish up with this go to jim mars
[28:23.560 --> 28:29.000]  it's now basically admitted the government killed rfk and we've got a high-level member
[28:29.000 --> 28:54.040]  of the japanese parliament coming on to talk about 911 inside job straight with us our beloved
[28:54.040 --> 28:59.320]  republic is on her knees the forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide but
[28:59.320 --> 29:03.880]  in liberty's darkest hour there is hope the first time in modern history the people are beginning
[29:03.880 --> 29:08.840]  to wake up it is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of
[29:08.840 --> 29:13.640]  the new world order master plan we have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people

[30:56.920 --> 31:00.840]  feeling better than you have in years and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns
[31:00.840 --> 31:05.560]  blood sugar levels and had a sense of well-being overall there's something that is changing
[31:05.560 --> 31:10.360]  thousands of people's lives and you could be one of them it's called heart and body extract
[31:10.360 --> 31:14.840]  Sharon Harris co-creator of heart and body extract talks about the positive effects of
[31:14.840 --> 31:19.800]  heart and body extract what happens with the formula heart and body extract is giving the body
[31:19.800 --> 31:25.400]  the necessary vitamins minerals amino acids enzymes and phytonutrients so the body will heal
[31:25.400 --> 31:30.680]  itself and yes the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure balance cholesterol
[31:30.680 --> 31:36.280]  clean and unclog the arteries it can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetic so the
[31:36.280 --> 31:41.880]  body is an amazing thing it simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself here are just
[31:41.880 --> 31:46.680]  a few of the benefits associated with heart and body extract blood sugar cholesterol and circulation
[31:46.680 --> 31:52.360]  levels return to normal arteries unclog and gina is gone in just a few days blood pressure goes
[31:52.360 --> 31:58.440]  back to normal and irregular heartbeat returns to normal heart and body extract works by making sure
[31:58.440 --> 32:03.800]  your body is in balance naturally with absolutely no negative side effects doctors who've tried
[32:03.800 --> 32:08.520]  heart and body extract with their patients are thrilled with the results dr mark goodman talks
[32:08.520 --> 32:12.840]  about his experience with a patient of his who started taking heart and body extract i have the
[32:12.840 --> 32:17.160]  best experience with was a gentleman who was a colleague of mine for many many years and so we
[32:17.160 --> 32:22.200]  got him this product and um he could not walk from his house with a mailbox to get his mail because
[32:22.200 --> 32:27.240]  he had congestive heart failure and after being on this product for about four to six weeks he was
[32:27.240 --> 32:32.120]  able to walk 50 minutes per day and after two months he was walking up to three miles per day

[32:52.040 --> 33:00.920]  you are listening to gcn visit gcnlive.com today
[33:09.960 --> 33:16.200]  all right we're back live we're about to go to a man who is recognized as the world expert on the
[33:16.200 --> 33:22.520]  jfk and rfk assassinations he was the first person to teach an accredited college course
[33:22.520 --> 33:27.960]  in the assassination of course he was working uh dallas and fortworth as a crime reporter
[33:27.960 --> 33:33.880]  in fact he even danced on the bar at jack ruby's bar in the weeks before the jfk assassination
[33:33.880 --> 33:39.240]  in dallas 43 years ago but bobby's in the news now that's coming up in just a few minutes
[33:39.240 --> 33:44.040]  yet later this week on the weekday show or maybe even next sunday i'm going to do like two hours
[33:44.040 --> 33:51.720]  on advanced technologies uh on the types of things that the superconducting super colliders uh
[33:51.720 --> 33:58.920]  that that the uh quantum mechanics that the that the engineers are are the the physicists are doing
[33:58.920 --> 34:05.640]  there and a lot of i mean the head physicist the guy who previously headed up the royal
[34:07.480 --> 34:13.400]  society in england said 20 years ago he thought it could create black holes and that's why other
[34:13.400 --> 34:18.360]  physicists checked into it and and and said my god uh we think they're going to create black
[34:18.360 --> 34:22.600]  holes in these colliders there's a good chance that they do thousands of experiments with these
[34:22.600 --> 34:28.120]  heavy particles that this will happen and there's a bunch of other things they can create and now
[34:28.120 --> 34:32.920]  they've been doing that and you understand the black hole gets going it'll just suck the whole
[34:32.920 --> 34:37.400]  planet into it everything down to something much smaller than than the head of a pen and if you
[34:37.400 --> 34:43.560]  want to laugh at these equations plank and others in 1910 Einstein just picked it up and codified
[34:43.560 --> 34:49.720]  it german physicist came up with the plans and said our mathematics show that if you do this
[34:49.720 --> 34:55.160]  with uranium or plutonium that you'll have this happen and they were able to predict the yields
[34:55.160 --> 35:03.480]  exactly 30 years before it happened in 1944 and they dropped it in 45 that's 60 plus years ago
[35:03.480 --> 35:09.320]  almost 70 years ago and then the air force admits they've made antimatter weapons uh they admit that
[35:09.320 --> 35:18.120]  they've isolated antimatter in these chambers and then the new york times comes out and says well
[35:18.120 --> 35:24.200]  it is a problem but then they talk to the head of the european collider they call it the heavy
[35:24.200 --> 35:30.840]  the heavy reactor and uh well we only have jim for about 25 minutes i better shut up it's just
[35:30.840 --> 35:34.040]  how do you get into a subject like this this is the type of things while my kids are playing
[35:34.040 --> 35:38.360]  the backyard i'm thinking about this and i'm thinking about you know all the other serious
[35:38.360 --> 35:42.440]  issues why wouldn't you it's not like i'm special or intellectual you'll find out about this you
[35:42.440 --> 35:49.320]  get concerned and uh you find all these other top scientists are all concerned and the governments
[35:49.320 --> 35:54.760]  though all are in races with each other and and they're randomly splicing genetics they're randomly
[35:54.760 --> 35:59.480]  colliding heavy particles in superconducting supercolliders they're randomly just to see what
[35:59.480 --> 36:03.560]  will happen
[36:04.520 --> 36:08.680]  meanwhile the public's watching britney spears uh getting their botox
[36:10.440 --> 36:13.480]  i don't know what to do you know i know jim's actually written about subjects like this but
[36:13.480 --> 36:17.640]  we're about to get into bobby here briefly uh jim uh i know you've been concerned about these
[36:17.640 --> 36:23.480]  superconducting supercolliders but i've talked to people with degrees uh even people who
[36:23.480 --> 36:28.920]  you know have got science degrees and they're not even aware of this jim well what what we all
[36:28.920 --> 36:36.040]  need to keep in mind is that back when they tested the first atomic bomb at the trinity
[36:36.040 --> 36:44.680]  site in new mexico this is in the spring of 1945 fully half or more of the scientists working on
[36:44.680 --> 36:51.480]  the manhattan project uh sincerely believed that once they set off a nuclear chain reaction
[36:51.480 --> 36:57.080]  they would not be able to stop it and it would eventually catch catch the atmosphere on fire
[36:57.080 --> 37:03.640]  and would incinerate the entire planet but they set it off anyway luckily they were wrong about
[37:03.640 --> 37:09.320]  that one but you're absolutely right alex uh there's no question in my mind that right now
[37:09.320 --> 37:16.920]  even as we speak and even as your listeners are listening uh there are deep secret government
[37:16.920 --> 37:24.600]  laboratories where they are uh tinkering with the basic energy building blocks of the universe
[37:24.600 --> 37:29.720]  now let's be clear in public labs they're doing things that their own equations say
[37:29.720 --> 37:34.680]  have a good chance of blowing the whole solar system to kingdom come and but blowing is the
[37:34.680 --> 37:39.480]  wrong word it won't be expanding it'll be contracting uh and that's just one of the threats
[37:39.480 --> 37:45.880]  and i i mean what is wrong with these people in fact they've got that uh famous uh documentary
[37:45.880 --> 37:49.800]  from discovery channel the trinity where it showed the secret test for the first time where
[37:49.800 --> 37:55.240]  they detonated in one night like a hundred high-powered hydrogen bombs in the atmosphere
[37:55.240 --> 38:00.680]  to see if it would set the earth's atmosphere on fire i mean and that's on mainstream television
[38:00.680 --> 38:06.760]  at one night hundreds of nukes going off in the atmosphere and uh and now we're wondering why
[38:06.760 --> 38:12.680]  there's a hole in the ozone layer these people i mean what is wrong with the new world order
[38:12.680 --> 38:18.600]  one reason that they have uh been dismissing global warming for so long because once you
[38:18.600 --> 38:23.160]  really look at it you figure out that it was above the above ground atomic testing that blew
[38:23.160 --> 38:27.480]  the holes in the atmosphere then there's major studies on that i tell you there's not a subject
[38:27.480 --> 38:33.080]  jim in an expert on we only have about 20 minutes uh jim on let's quickly get into the two separate
[38:33.080 --> 38:39.880]  articles that have broken two separate camps the bbc three-year investigation news night their most
[38:39.880 --> 38:47.240]  prestigious program basically their nightly news saying that uh four cia high-level operatives from
[38:47.240 --> 38:53.880]  southeast asia photographed filmed around bobby at the time something you've always said and then
[38:53.880 --> 38:58.520]  separately we always knew that the coroner had talked about a ming shot in the back not in the
[38:58.520 --> 39:03.240]  front and now we have the head of the national forensic society and a whole bunch of other
[39:03.240 --> 39:07.960]  top scientists saying yes he was shot from the back not from the front boil it down for folks the
[39:07.960 --> 39:14.120]  two separate camps then let's go into detail on both sides well uh of course this is actually
[39:14.120 --> 39:20.120]  nothing new uh it may and many other people uh almost since the time of the robert kennedy
[39:20.120 --> 39:28.120]  assassination have uh loudly tried to shout out that uh he was not killed by sarhan sarhan who
[39:28.120 --> 39:34.440]  cannot remember anything that happened since he was probably brainwashed um but what is happening
[39:34.440 --> 39:39.960]  is and what makes these stories significant is that after all these years and after all the
[39:39.960 --> 39:47.000]  uh further evidence including scientific evidence comes out uh more and more people are waking up
[39:47.000 --> 39:52.440]  and beginning to realize that the so-called conspiracy theorists were actually right all
[39:52.440 --> 39:57.800]  along just as we were in the kennedy assassination just as we were in the martin luther king
[39:57.800 --> 40:05.720]  assassination just as we were in uh the gulf of tarkin weiko the bombing of the world of the uh
[40:05.720 --> 40:12.840]  uh murrah federal building in oakland city uh you know they're finally beginning to kind of wake up
[40:12.840 --> 40:18.840]  and it's almost too late because i know you like i do keep up with the economic news and uh
[40:19.640 --> 40:26.040]  it does not look good at all we're just uh uh basically we're a nation that's broke because
[40:26.040 --> 40:33.080]  according to the government's own statistics um the total government obligations total more than
[40:33.080 --> 40:40.760]  53 trillion dollars and compare that against the net worth of all us households which is
[40:41.560 --> 40:46.760]  estimated is just slightly above 40 trillion dollars so we owe more money than we could
[40:46.760 --> 40:51.560]  possibly ever that's right the private bankers created a liquidity bubble that no one again
[40:51.560 --> 40:57.800]  it's a uh uh economist called it a financial black hole its mass is so much greater than all
[40:57.800 --> 41:02.840]  real assets it cannot be escaped and the bankers will have a consolidation the federal reserve
[41:02.840 --> 41:08.920]  in 93 and then in 99 publicly change the rules to allow the criminal lending we have just witnessed
[41:08.920 --> 41:13.240]  that popped the the bubble we said three years ago that would start with the housing market
[41:13.240 --> 41:18.600]  we were right from inside sources inside davos and bill deberg and now new york times treasury
[41:18.600 --> 41:22.520]  department plan would give federal reserve more power federal reserve seeks broad authority
[41:22.520 --> 41:28.600]  to oversee financial market stability and they say with actual less regulation so they engineer
[41:28.600 --> 41:33.720]  the collapse and then they play the part of the judge jury and execution over their own crime jim
[41:33.720 --> 41:40.440]  mars that's exactly correct in fact if you go back and check out the uh booms and bust of the late
[41:40.440 --> 41:46.600]  1800s and early 1900s uh it was all contrived and the whole purpose was to create the federal
[41:46.600 --> 41:53.960]  reserve system in the first place which uh they studiously up until maybe uh just a decade ago
[41:53.960 --> 41:59.240]  refused to refer to as a central bank and now just all of a sudden you listen to national public
[41:59.240 --> 42:04.520]  radio you can read the wall street journal and they refer to the fed as the central bank the
[42:04.520 --> 42:10.920]  central bank is an issue that was uh highly contested since the very founding of this republic
[42:10.920 --> 42:16.840]  and basically the people have always said we don't want a central bank and yet uh now we have one
[42:16.840 --> 42:23.080]  and nobody ever got a chance to vote on it and now we gave the private bankers total control over
[42:23.080 --> 42:28.440]  the fiat currency and they're going to completely rape us jim though i want to in the last segment
[42:28.440 --> 42:33.640]  we've got with you i want us i know you've written books on it covered at nauseam it's old news for
[42:33.640 --> 42:41.240]  you it's all over the news now walk through exactly how they killed bobby in the back uh now they've
[42:41.240 --> 42:46.520]  even isolated that it was his gun that did it uh i mean this is mainstream news but i want to go over
[42:46.520 --> 42:53.560]  how they engineered that a lot more with our guests on the other side jim r's on alex johnson

[47:21.240 --> 47:27.480]  months you got a new book coming out too are you ready to tell folks what it's about proving
[47:28.040 --> 47:33.880]  how the whole nazi system was just transplanted over here jim well that's pretty much the story
[47:33.880 --> 47:39.720]  except of course that sounds pretty outrageous that oh wait a minute we're we are now the fourth
[47:39.720 --> 47:45.320]  right but uh if you'll read the material that i've put together in a new book that's due out here
[47:45.320 --> 47:51.080]  in a couple of months uh you'll find the names dates places families corporations
[47:51.080 --> 47:56.760]  which supported hitler and then when the hitler's third rike was defeated in world war two they
[47:56.760 --> 48:02.040]  simply uh brought thousands and thousands of nazis and pro-nazis and that's because there
[48:02.040 --> 48:08.120]  was already a huge nazi apparatus with the rockefellers right over here the owner uh thomas
[48:08.120 --> 48:16.200]  uh watson of ibm the bush senior was the head nazi backman uh of the yeah the names of the names
[48:16.200 --> 48:23.400]  of prominent americans who supported hitler is is pretty amazing uh you've got uh watson of ibm
[48:23.400 --> 48:28.600]  you've got henry ford of ford motor company you've got chase bank and john jay mccloy
[48:28.600 --> 48:33.800]  you've got the dullis brothers you got the rock who are all representing the rockefellers standard
[48:33.800 --> 48:40.120]  oil uh standard oil by the way had tankers that were refueling german u-boats in the caribbean
[48:41.080 --> 48:48.520]  in uh late 1944 almost towards the end of the war uh it's all it's always a deal it's just
[48:48.520 --> 48:53.880]  it's always a business deal they put hitler in power and then set him up i mean i mean as you
[48:53.880 --> 48:57.400]  know but that's all mainstream history i can't wait i'm gonna carry the book on the shopping
[48:57.400 --> 49:03.400]  cart the bookstore at info wars dot com okay we got about 10 minutes left get into the bobby situation
[49:03.400 --> 49:08.040]  i mean for people that don't know the basics of what really happened okay uh what most people
[49:08.040 --> 49:14.840]  know is that robert kennedy uh on the very night in june of 1968 when he received the california
[49:14.840 --> 49:20.440]  nomination for president that pretty well sent him for the national democratic nomination in other
[49:20.440 --> 49:30.920]  words he was going to be the presidential candidate uh in uh 1968 um just a few days before that
[49:30.920 --> 49:36.600]  before his assassination he was asked uh you know what can you do about the death of your
[49:36.600 --> 49:41.320]  brother president john f kennedy and he replied that he couldn't do anything about the death of
[49:41.320 --> 49:46.920]  his brother until he had the powers of the presidency which tells me he knows what alex you
[49:46.920 --> 49:53.480]  and i both know which is you have to have control of the fbi the cia the nsa all these other alphabet
[49:53.480 --> 50:00.040]  agencies before you can reveal what actually happened in the kennedy assassination but of
[50:00.040 --> 50:05.240]  course he never got a chance to do that because walking through a pantry a back pantry of the
[50:05.240 --> 50:11.800]  ambassador hotel shots were fired and he was fatally wounded okay now we all know that we all know
[50:11.800 --> 50:18.440]  that sir hand sir hand went to trial and is serving a life sentence uh for doing the shooting
[50:18.440 --> 50:23.640]  here's what you need to remember about the robert kennedy assassination number one sir hand sir hand
[50:23.640 --> 50:30.840]  never got uh closer than three or four feet in front of kennedy and yet thomas neguchi a world
[50:30.840 --> 50:36.680]  class medical examiner testified under oath in court that the shot to kill robert kennedy was fired
[50:36.680 --> 50:43.160]  into his uh right behind the right ear at the right mastoid there were four shots pumped into him
[50:43.160 --> 50:50.120]  yeah we're in a back one and one in the head and uh so the thing to remember is is that
[50:50.120 --> 50:56.200]  neguchi said that the shot to his right mastoid behind his right ear was at no more than three
[50:56.200 --> 51:03.240]  inches away so he was huge powder burns deeply burned in exactly so he was shot by someone
[51:03.240 --> 51:07.640]  standing right beside by the way he was the big la corner but they went after him but then he got
[51:07.640 --> 51:12.440]  vindicated later i mean this is the corner medical examiner saying he was shot in the back
[51:12.440 --> 51:17.880]  and and we have this little friend behind him and now it's the same gun we know he owned that these
[51:17.880 --> 51:23.800]  acoustics experts have matched but go ahead that's right so the actual killer of uh robert kennedy was
[51:23.800 --> 51:30.440]  a part-time security guard caught named fame cesar and his name has been bounced around for years
[51:30.440 --> 51:35.640]  and if there's no truth to this you'd think that cesar or his family would have filed suit made
[51:35.640 --> 51:43.400]  lots of money but nobody said anything and interestingly enough his day job was uh working
[51:43.400 --> 51:52.120]  at a u2 spy plane facility run by the cia so we see the footprints of cia and of government funny
[51:52.120 --> 51:58.360]  lee harvey uh oswald worked at the u2 spy base that's true and lee harvey oswald by the way and
[51:58.360 --> 52:05.240]  this has been totally confirmed was being used operationally by the cia prior to the assassination
[52:05.240 --> 52:09.160]  now that that control number has now been declassified but i'm interrupting here
[52:09.160 --> 52:14.360]  we're not just saying this about mr cesar uh he's the guy standing right behind kennedy
[52:14.360 --> 52:20.200]  when all of this happened and now this is abc news this is cbs nbc they're coming out and saying it
[52:20.200 --> 52:24.520]  the top forensic experts of the country the top i mean the guy that heads up the society
[52:24.520 --> 52:30.280]  they have gone in with the audio and isolated it to 14 shots explain that and then they matched it
[52:30.280 --> 52:35.560]  to the gun that cesar even had a license for that's right there were more shots fired than
[52:35.560 --> 52:45.080]  was possible for uh sir hand sir hands a six-shot revolver to uh to accommodate now everything this
[52:45.080 --> 52:50.520]  is the same thing that's going on and on uh 40 years after the kennedy assassination we finally
[52:50.520 --> 52:55.400]  anybody that cared to look uh could determine for themselves that he was killed as a result
[52:55.400 --> 52:59.480]  of a conspiracy to track right back to the federal government of the united states
[52:59.480 --> 53:04.120]  same thing now with robert kennedy and he had just won the i mean he had locked in the democratic
[53:04.120 --> 53:11.480]  nomination right and but my point is is that 40 years later it's like okay we'll tell the truth
[53:11.480 --> 53:17.320]  now or we'll allow the truth to come out because who's going to do anything and i say this because
[53:17.320 --> 53:22.120]  nine eleven is not that far back and we are still embroiled in the effects of nine eleven
[53:22.120 --> 53:28.360]  homeland security the wars in afghanistan iraq and it was all based on lies right down the line
[53:28.360 --> 53:33.720]  and as more information comes out we're finding that nine eleven was indeed an inside job stop
[53:33.720 --> 53:37.400]  there i want to get into that in closing but let's go back for people to be clear for police
[53:37.400 --> 53:42.200]  officers listening for instance it's mainstream news admitted the corner the police and they
[53:42.200 --> 53:47.800]  were told to show up about it 14 bullet holes they dug out two different calibers and sir hand
[53:47.800 --> 53:53.080]  had this six-shot gun right and they said and by the way he was grabbed after the first shot
[53:53.080 --> 53:59.720]  and his arm pinned down that's true the big uh rayford johnson and uh uh some other big old
[53:59.720 --> 54:05.880]  football player rosie greer they all jumped on him okay he may have gotten off one decent shot
[54:05.880 --> 54:10.360]  and the rest of the shots went wild in fact that's another thing to remember in the death of robert
[54:10.360 --> 54:15.960]  kennedy there were bullet holes and door panels and in the ceiling tiles these were all taken away
[54:15.960 --> 54:21.720]  by the los angeles police department and have now disappeared they're not available to anybody
[54:21.720 --> 54:26.520]  okay if that's not evidence of a cover-up then i don't know what is the same thing with oklahoma
[54:26.520 --> 54:30.440]  city they have controlled demolition incorporated come in and blow up the rest of the building
[54:30.440 --> 54:35.720]  hide it under guard pour concrete in with the chunks same thing with jfk same thing with 911
[54:35.720 --> 54:42.520]  same thing with waco covering up the evidence exactly and uh they are now so arrogant about it
[54:42.520 --> 54:47.240]  that they don't even take too much pain and trouble to cover it up they even blow up building seven
[54:47.240 --> 54:51.640]  in front of everybody that's right and then just said well there was a little fire in it somewhere
[54:51.640 --> 54:59.800]  but now we have just everybody all these physicists all these scientists you know italian presidents
[54:59.800 --> 55:09.080]  cia section chiefs uh willy nelson i mean i mean the all these top actors best actress this year
[55:09.080 --> 55:13.800]  bruce willis bruce willis uh no longer being a neocon saying they killed kennedy and the
[55:13.800 --> 55:18.200]  same group that did that basically did 911 i mean they're losing all their own people what are they
[55:18.200 --> 55:25.320]  going to do well unfortunately they'll probably go to the tactic of desperation newt to launch another
[55:25.320 --> 55:32.280]  war or to set off a nuke or some terrible uh terrorist weapon in this country and then of
[55:32.280 --> 55:37.240]  course blame it on foreign terrorists and take more power meanwhile the very same elite with the
[55:37.240 --> 55:41.960]  admitted uh superconducting super colliders and other similar facilities are doing things their
[55:41.960 --> 55:48.040]  own equations say good chance of blowing the entire planet up i mean what's wrong with these people
[55:48.040 --> 55:55.320]  i don't know but they need to be stopped they're just totally power mad aren't they jim absolutely
[55:55.320 --> 56:00.600]  absolutely and a little power is not enough it it's all of this is being orchestrated by the
[56:00.600 --> 56:07.080]  oligarchy that runs this country the little small wealthy elite and these people deal in
[56:07.080 --> 56:13.080]  millions of dollars i mean you know five ten million to them is pocket change uh how much more
[56:13.080 --> 56:18.840]  how much more wealth and power do you want well it's their very nature to be hyper competitive
[56:19.400 --> 56:25.000]  and uh they and plus just as the mad scientist out there who will do anything i mean they
[56:25.720 --> 56:31.480]  thousands of factories randomly splicing every type of dna you can imagine already giving rise to
[56:31.480 --> 56:38.120]  superviruses super bacteria i mean that alone can create the andromeda strain i mean that's why
[56:38.120 --> 56:42.600]  so many top scientists say they believe there's a very low probability that will even survive as a
[56:42.600 --> 56:48.440]  species jim well uh if we're going to survive we better start paying attention and start standing
[56:48.440 --> 56:55.000]  up for ourselves uh well i'm not an anti-technology person but we need to put serious breaks on all
[56:55.000 --> 56:59.960]  of these you know hyper uh you know you know sensitive technologies because they admit they're
[56:59.960 --> 57:04.920]  doing all these experiments having no idea what it's going to do well what we need to do is pass
[57:04.920 --> 57:10.600]  some laws that says all of this should be done uh in the open okay everybody needs to know what
[57:10.600 --> 57:15.880]  they're working on how they're working on it okay and that way then the public can uh
[57:16.600 --> 57:21.240]  thoughtfully decide if that's proper or not but like dick cheney says he doesn't care what the

[1:06:53.320 --> 1:06:59.560]  on national japanese television in the house of counselors and brought out a lot of information
[1:06:59.560 --> 1:07:05.320]  documented at nine eleven is an inside job and that idea that information is taking hold in japan
[1:07:05.320 --> 1:07:13.960]  and all over the world and so i want to welcome mr fujita on the show with us sir we really appreciate
[1:07:13.960 --> 1:07:20.680]  your research your courage and the fact that you do have the courage to speak out on an issue that
[1:07:20.680 --> 1:07:26.040]  more and more people know it's true but do not have the courage to speak out so we appreciate your
[1:07:26.040 --> 1:07:33.240]  courage thank you so much when did you first start to question the official story when did you
[1:07:33.240 --> 1:07:41.880]  first begin to look into questions of nine eleven attacks about two years ago when i watched the
[1:07:41.880 --> 1:07:50.120]  video the plain sight and also some documents and some photos from two years ago what was it
[1:07:50.120 --> 1:07:55.320]  like for you as you began to research some of the alternative views of nine eleven what was that
[1:07:55.320 --> 1:08:02.600]  awakening process like well at the beginning i thought i couldn't believe you know this can't
[1:08:02.600 --> 1:08:10.760]  be true but then last year when i heard more about various facts and the photos such as the
[1:08:10.760 --> 1:08:18.120]  collapse of the seventh building in the world trade center and also have heard about the put
[1:08:18.120 --> 1:08:25.960]  options that were obviously conducted a few days before the nine eleven i began to see that they
[1:08:25.960 --> 1:08:34.360]  were serious and the actual evidences of someone apart from al-qaeda might be involved so i began
[1:08:34.360 --> 1:08:42.760]  to have further research on various facts yuka hisa fujita is our guest today a senior member of the
[1:08:42.760 --> 1:08:47.800]  japanese parliament one of the leaders of this democratic party over there uh what has the
[1:08:47.800 --> 1:08:57.320]  response by your your fellow countrymen other japanese to your going public well i was very
[1:08:57.320 --> 1:09:05.880]  surprised that there are yes one or two people who said that i'm anti-american or anti-government
[1:09:05.880 --> 1:09:14.440]  but a lot of people a few dozens of people replied to my email encouraging my efforts
[1:09:14.440 --> 1:09:21.000]  and thanked me for my courage to ask the questions in public to the prime minister
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:27.400]  and i was also surprised that actually quite a few fellow MPs in my party had known
[1:09:27.400 --> 1:09:37.880]  bit and pieces of nine eleven someone knew about some fba person who testified in the commission
[1:09:37.880 --> 1:09:45.640]  that refused to go on and another person knew about the good options so quite a few japanese
[1:09:45.640 --> 1:09:51.960]  MPs in my party knew about them but did not have further enough information to speak up
[1:09:52.600 --> 1:09:59.160]  but they were pleased that i took a courage yes sir for those that don't know what put options are
[1:09:59.880 --> 1:10:07.640]  would you like to explain it to them well um you can buy certain stocks by a set price
[1:10:07.640 --> 1:10:15.720]  so if the price of the stock fell down as it did for united airlines and american airlines
[1:10:15.720 --> 1:10:22.840]  you can receive a lot of profit out of it and then the government engaged in a cover-up of that
[1:10:22.840 --> 1:10:32.120]  though it led back to the cia director buzzy chron guard yes very suspicious what about the
[1:10:32.120 --> 1:10:39.720]  fact that us troops 44 000 us 18 000 british troops aircraft carriers had already masked around
[1:10:39.720 --> 1:10:49.640]  afghanistan president bush uh president basher had signed the document uh to attack afghanistan
[1:10:49.640 --> 1:10:58.680]  the day before nine eleven well obviously various facts are coming up that u.s government obviously
[1:10:58.680 --> 1:11:05.880]  had been planning the attacks for afghanistan and later for iraq now that is another reason why i
[1:11:05.880 --> 1:11:12.120]  thought to take up this question because you know 24 japanese were killed in new york and because of
[1:11:12.120 --> 1:11:18.920]  that japanese government for all these governments to go into the warfare in afghanistan and iraq
[1:11:18.920 --> 1:11:26.120]  but when i asked the prime minister of japan how those 24 japanese were killed he didn't actually
[1:11:26.120 --> 1:11:33.000]  answer properly the japanese government had not have physical evidence of how those 24 japanese
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:40.840]  were killed i asked them if dna test was conducted for some of them for those whose bodies were not
[1:11:40.840 --> 1:11:47.240]  found the answer was that they do not have evidence well even the fbi sir as you know but
[1:11:47.240 --> 1:11:54.920]  listeners may not does not have been lauten listed as a wanted man for nine eleven the fbi won't
[1:11:54.920 --> 1:12:02.280]  even say bin laden did it yeah and this is why i am now asking written questions to the prime
[1:12:02.280 --> 1:12:08.040]  minister we have a system to ask written questions to the prime minister properly so i've been going
[1:12:08.040 --> 1:12:15.240]  on uh two uh round of questions and answers and i have done the third question to be answered next
[1:12:15.240 --> 1:12:22.760]  week so two separate times you have gone before uh the highest body of the parliament which you're
[1:12:22.760 --> 1:12:28.040]  a member of and have brought this forward i have to tell you reading the faces the prime minister
[1:12:28.040 --> 1:12:35.320]  and others they looked very i don't want to say afraid but very concerned very upset they were
[1:12:35.320 --> 1:12:42.920]  not laughing at you which again shows they know this is serious yes actually what the prime minister
[1:12:42.920 --> 1:12:48.520]  was looking at was the japanese translation of some of the quotes from patriots question nine
[1:12:48.520 --> 1:12:58.440]  eleven and i included you know former minister of defense of germany and the former president of
[1:12:58.440 --> 1:13:05.000]  central bank of germany who admitted that there were put option by the way i went to see him the
[1:13:06.200 --> 1:13:12.120]  chairman of bundesbank central bank of germany who had said there were put option i met him
[1:13:12.120 --> 1:13:19.320]  in person a few weeks ago in in europe and therefore the prime minister in the hearing in japan
[1:13:19.320 --> 1:13:27.320]  could not deny what i was trying to prove amazing amazing people with your type of courage may
[1:13:27.320 --> 1:13:33.800]  save us and we have andres von bulow uh who was the defense head in parliament we have the former
[1:13:34.520 --> 1:13:41.000]  very respected president of italy saying that that the us stage terror attacks which have been
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:46.840]  declassified in europe to blame it on communist uh... gulf of tonkin was staged uss liberty was
[1:13:46.840 --> 1:13:53.400]  staged that's now been declassified i want to be clear it's not our whole government it is criminals
[1:13:53.400 --> 1:13:59.720]  inside of it doing this uh... what are they going to do as the truth begins to break through the dam
[1:13:59.720 --> 1:14:11.720]  well um i started from the aspect of the twenty four japanese killed and the government also has
[1:14:11.720 --> 1:14:17.560]  said in answering to my question that terrorism is a crime and if it is a crime you have to
[1:14:17.560 --> 1:14:24.040]  investigate therefore i urge the japanese government to invest directly or indirectly
[1:14:24.040 --> 1:14:29.560]  then to verify if it was right for japan to support the warfare in afghanistan and the
[1:14:29.560 --> 1:14:38.280]  iraq then eventually ask the japanese government to ask the u.s government to have proper investigation
[1:14:38.280 --> 1:14:44.360]  again and this is something we parliamentarians of various countries could ask i was in europe
[1:14:44.360 --> 1:14:51.400]  meeting with european mp's and they are also thinking about asking the u n to investigate
[1:14:51.400 --> 1:14:58.520]  um uh... again so these kind of efforts have to be done in you know more internationally
[1:14:59.400 --> 1:15:02.120]  the perpetrators i think are starting to get scared
[1:15:03.880 --> 1:15:10.440]  um i don't know therefore some people say that uh i better be careful about my own you know life
[1:15:10.440 --> 1:15:15.160]  they better be careful because millions of people who have courage like yourself are
[1:15:15.160 --> 1:15:21.480]  starting to stand up stay there pleaser uh we'll be right back uh with our guests remember the

[1:20:10.680 --> 1:20:19.880]  party the democratic party of japan he is in the elite upper house of the diet the um
[1:20:19.880 --> 1:20:29.160]  um the counselors area house of the counselors and he joins us here today we have stories
[1:20:29.160 --> 1:20:35.880]  up on prison planet dot com of the hundreds of ci section chiefs from the us other intelligence
[1:20:35.880 --> 1:20:41.720]  directors two different former heads of german intelligence i mean he goes on and on russian
[1:20:41.720 --> 1:20:50.040]  generals anyone who looks at nine eleven uh mr fujita isn't an insult to our intelligence when we
[1:20:50.040 --> 1:20:54.200]  have firemen and police on video saying get back they're going to blow up building seven they're
[1:20:54.200 --> 1:20:58.360]  going to bring it down and we have all these witnesses and and and all of this happening
[1:20:58.360 --> 1:21:03.960]  why do you think the perpetrators thought we were so stupid and that they could do this in plain view
[1:21:03.960 --> 1:21:15.080]  i think uh they did not think that the internet world was so um prevailing that citizens can
[1:21:15.080 --> 1:21:22.520]  have access to those informations years later what happened but you know i have been to europe
[1:21:23.240 --> 1:21:29.640]  to see the truth seekers in eleven european countries and i have also been to australia
[1:21:29.640 --> 1:21:36.520]  to a conference on nine eleventh organized by truth seekers there you know the internet was
[1:21:36.520 --> 1:21:42.920]  an invention by the military people but now citizens are making the best use of it and
[1:21:42.920 --> 1:21:49.400]  citizens now can have access to the information so what has been able to be hidden by now cannot
[1:21:49.400 --> 1:21:56.120]  be hidden anymore and they have opened pandora's box i think inadvertently you're absolutely right
[1:21:56.120 --> 1:22:01.560]  and to be clear you just were you you just had a presentation at the european parliament
[1:22:01.560 --> 1:22:06.840]  with with andres von bulow and all these i mean the former head of the military all these top
[1:22:06.840 --> 1:22:12.040]  people they're saying the same thing showing videos showing documents that's got to scare
[1:22:12.040 --> 1:22:19.800]  the people that carried out nine eleven yes and i think that film shown in the united i mean
[1:22:19.800 --> 1:22:27.800]  european building was a film called zero uh made by italian uh member of parliament now the important
[1:22:27.800 --> 1:22:34.040]  thing about the zero is that this film is not meant to be shown in the internet world but in
[1:22:34.040 --> 1:22:40.440]  the film theaters in various cities in various countries and i think the most important thing
[1:22:40.440 --> 1:22:48.440]  now is that we have to go out from internet world to sort of daylight world that common people who
[1:22:48.440 --> 1:22:54.680]  do not use their computers in the villages in various countries can have access to the information
[1:22:54.680 --> 1:22:59.480]  that's right we have to take it out of the cyberspace and then physically manifest in the three
[1:22:59.480 --> 1:23:06.920]  dimensional universe yes indeed well you're helping do that i mean when we've got all the top actors
[1:23:06.920 --> 1:23:13.160]  and willy nelson and you know the media can't ignore them but they are ignoring the scientists
[1:23:13.160 --> 1:23:19.160]  and experts because they're afraid how do we force them to look at all the scientists and experts and
[1:23:19.160 --> 1:23:24.360]  bill christiansen was a ci section chief in europe i mean this guy's very high level he's saying
[1:23:24.360 --> 1:23:32.760]  inside job how do they ignore that well i think that the team efforts by the scientists of various
[1:23:32.760 --> 1:23:39.400]  continents together and the politicians of various continents together and the media people of various
[1:23:39.400 --> 1:23:48.200]  continents together to have common sort of strategy to pursue the the investigation of the thing
[1:23:48.920 --> 1:23:57.400]  either sort of the un or various european mp's network and i have been very encouraged by various
[1:23:57.400 --> 1:24:05.720]  us politicians who have been speaking up mr kushinich i understand yes a congressman has
[1:24:05.720 --> 1:24:12.360]  asked to have investigation again on those put options yes i will we had him on the
[1:24:12.360 --> 1:24:19.160]  announced that a few months ago yes and boy they have gone after him uh the good news is if if we
[1:24:19.160 --> 1:24:24.280]  don't expose the people that did this and they've now been caught gulf of tonkin declassified to
[1:24:24.280 --> 1:24:30.680]  get us into vietnam us's liberty declassified that was stage chicago tribune um so many things
[1:24:30.680 --> 1:24:36.600]  that they killed kennedy they killed bobby kennedy all coming out very small military group
[1:24:37.240 --> 1:24:43.560]  controlled by a few central banks in europe they are cannot stand exposure but if we don't expose
[1:24:43.560 --> 1:24:48.200]  them as you know mr fugita member of parliament they are going to continue to use the problem
[1:24:48.200 --> 1:24:54.600]  reaction solution uh same thing hitler used firebombing his own Reichstag to take over Germany
[1:24:54.600 --> 1:25:01.720]  i mean you agree that we've got to expose them or they will continue to stage more events
[1:25:02.680 --> 1:25:08.360]  yes i think so the way we have been what you have been exposing the things more in the
[1:25:08.360 --> 1:25:17.400]  internet world now has to expose those things in physical media means you told me you'd seen
[1:25:17.400 --> 1:25:22.280]  some of my films or pieces of them which have you seen because i'm going to send you all of them
[1:25:22.280 --> 1:25:30.040]  um yes um sorry i have seen various films by so many people so i can't sort of remember
[1:25:30.040 --> 1:25:35.560]  which of you have well well i will send them all to you my film yes please i think our strongest
[1:25:35.560 --> 1:25:41.160]  point is the science but also the admission of false flag terror you know the fact that
[1:25:41.160 --> 1:25:47.160]  governments have been caught doing it before i don't think the public realizes that false flag
[1:25:47.160 --> 1:25:53.720]  inside job is so popular in history yeah i think we seem to have more
[1:25:54.760 --> 1:26:03.000]  information that we need the time is coming for us in various walks of life to identify
[1:26:03.000 --> 1:26:11.800]  which evidence is most compelling and most of deniable and to make those evidences to be more
[1:26:11.800 --> 1:26:18.040]  visual by the common people who do not use computers yes sir in closing when you were there
[1:26:18.040 --> 1:26:23.400]  the highest level is ebony's parliament presenting video clips and stills of firemen talking about
[1:26:23.400 --> 1:26:28.760]  bombs going off and being told to get back they were going to blow it up what yes what was the
[1:26:28.760 --> 1:26:33.960]  average response of other members of parliament where they they looked shocked to be seeing this
[1:26:33.960 --> 1:26:40.760]  were they shocked they were shocked and they were surprised and the number seven building
[1:26:40.760 --> 1:26:46.600]  in a story i think the most compelling most convincing for them to understand
[1:26:47.400 --> 1:26:56.760]  and the pet option was another sort of convincing sort of element absolutely
[1:26:58.280 --> 1:27:02.280]  in japan i've been told that people are really starting to get into
[1:27:02.280 --> 1:27:08.280]  nine eleven million inside job is that the case well as i said there are quite a few
[1:27:08.280 --> 1:27:17.080]  um several dozen MPs in my party now are quite convinced about the wrongs about nine eleven
[1:27:17.080 --> 1:27:24.600]  official report and they are supporting me to have more further sort of approach and tomorrow

[1:34:08.760 --> 1:34:17.800]  john in florida been holding the longest you are on the air john welcome hi hi hello yes I want to
[1:34:17.800 --> 1:34:21.640]  make this quick as possible I have to cell phone so let me get this microwave away from my head
[1:34:21.640 --> 1:34:26.040]  before it increases my brain temperature too much don't say that that hurts valuable infrastructure
[1:34:26.040 --> 1:34:31.160]  badmouthing u.s companies are without kind of go ahead shut up I understand that but um I would just
[1:34:31.160 --> 1:34:37.960]  like to speak about the cost of I don't know whether the cost is for me has been more from the
[1:34:37.960 --> 1:34:46.520]  economic downturn or say from trying to relate this information to people I know I live in
[1:34:46.520 --> 1:34:53.640]  Florida my mom is a realistic broker and now she is broke my dad is a contractor of Georgia
[1:34:53.640 --> 1:34:59.720]  he is selling the houses he is contracted to get up from under them from keep losing money
[1:35:00.600 --> 1:35:05.880]  and I try to relate this information to people about how the IMS documents came out saying
[1:35:05.880 --> 1:35:11.640]  that they were going to bust a real estate bubble and you know all this other information and people
[1:35:11.640 --> 1:35:17.480]  call me a brainwashed conspiracy theory well they're that no they're the ones they're scared that
[1:35:17.480 --> 1:35:23.000]  it's going to get worse and it is scary to know this was all engineered and it is but even the
[1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:27.560]  financial times of London admits that it is scary to find there's bad people running things
[1:35:27.560 --> 1:35:31.000]  and so they'd rather keep living in a fantasy land and then but look they're gonna wake up don't
[1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:36.440]  worry I know probably when it's too late but you know they're gonna wake up and I get into
[1:35:36.440 --> 1:35:42.040]  arguments with my boss he's an ex-police officer and now we're in the metals business and we're
[1:35:42.040 --> 1:35:47.800]  sending out you know metals to China as fast as he can and because he thinks he's making
[1:35:47.800 --> 1:35:55.800]  good money off this the economy's fine that you know he's his economic situation well yeah I mean
[1:35:55.800 --> 1:36:02.360]  I mean it's a recession when your neighbor's out of work it's a depression when you're out of work
[1:36:02.920 --> 1:36:06.760]  and I'm not saying he shouldn't even be in the raw business of selling raw materiale
[1:36:07.320 --> 1:36:11.000]  the point is the government and I appreciate your call they they set up
[1:36:13.320 --> 1:36:17.240]  in taxes incentives to move offshore and the globalists said they were going to get rid of all
[1:36:17.240 --> 1:36:21.800]  of our industries and drive us into debt so they could fully bankrupt us and then buy everything
[1:36:21.800 --> 1:36:28.040]  up for pennies on the dollar uh you know it's the Federal Reserve that set the policies in 93 and
[1:36:28.040 --> 1:36:33.160]  99 that got everybody leveraged down and the subprime mortgage is only one part of that about a
[1:36:33.160 --> 1:36:38.520]  third of it the credit cards all of it they they knew they they issued credit out of nothing they
[1:36:38.520 --> 1:36:43.000]  the banks bought up all the real assets while that was happening or a lot of them now they're
[1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:47.640]  quote bailing themselves out with more of our tax money as they devalue the dollar at the same time
[1:36:47.640 --> 1:36:52.920]  and then the Federal Reserve who engineered it all who's just a shareholder in the global banking
[1:36:52.920 --> 1:36:58.360]  system the Federal Reserve is privately owned folks most banks don't own stock in it things like
[1:36:58.360 --> 1:37:04.520]  Chase do JP Morgan Chase and that's why they quote you know do the bailouts well they are the
[1:37:04.520 --> 1:37:11.080]  Federal Reserve and so this is just criminal bank consolidation going on and uh they want to hurt
[1:37:11.080 --> 1:37:16.040]  you and hurt you real bad and uh that's why they got riot police and FEMA camps built
[1:37:16.040 --> 1:37:19.880]  because they plan to bring it down to absolute nothing now they can do that this year next
[1:37:19.880 --> 1:37:25.000]  year three years from now i don't know but the imf documents well i mean you know your friends and
[1:37:25.000 --> 1:37:31.560]  family don't have to say they don't believe you you can just go to the bbc when it broke joseph
[1:37:31.560 --> 1:37:36.360]  sticklet's their chief economist nobel prize winner i've interviewed him several times he went public
[1:37:36.360 --> 1:37:41.560]  and the documents came out and it said they were going to engineer collapses and do all of this
[1:37:42.280 --> 1:37:45.320]  and so you can just take them that up they'll probably say that's not true either
[1:37:46.040 --> 1:37:51.960]  but uh but you know if your family's laughing at you move on you know purls before swine i'm not
[1:37:51.960 --> 1:37:56.360]  calling your parents pigs you know christ said that somebody wants to laugh and giggle i mean
[1:37:57.320 --> 1:38:00.760]  the average america can't find the u.s on a map the average american
[1:38:00.760 --> 1:38:07.720]  hardly knows how to wipe their hind in because they're they're forebears where the smartest
[1:38:07.720 --> 1:38:12.840]  toughest most root and tooth and this hardest working people there were and we're the children
[1:38:12.840 --> 1:38:17.640]  and the children of the children of the children of spoiled rotten people so we're lambs the slaughter
[1:38:21.240 --> 1:38:24.840]  all you can do is tell them who's going to rape them they're going to laugh at you but after
[1:38:24.840 --> 1:38:29.960]  they're good and raped by the man then they'll know let's go to the calls here let's go ahead and

[1:38:37.400 --> 1:38:43.160]  uh first time caller calling from new york welcome listening to the uh kacha interview on
[1:38:43.160 --> 1:38:50.760]  friday and uh i was a little annoyed and you know to him being completely oblivious to um you know
[1:38:50.760 --> 1:38:54.920]  the whole 9 11 building number seven that's right i interviewed former new york mayor
[1:38:54.920 --> 1:39:00.440]  coch former congressman he said basically ban free speech is fine yeah which doesn't make
[1:39:00.440 --> 1:39:05.560]  any sense and then well yeah it does they're gonna come arrest you if you it makes sense for the man
[1:39:06.520 --> 1:39:10.840]  they're gonna tell people that america never had free speech and then america fought free speech
[1:39:10.840 --> 1:39:15.560]  and the dummy uppies they know how to apply makeup they know how to act tough at the sports bar
[1:39:15.560 --> 1:39:21.240]  they don't know what america is yeah absolutely and then he claimed you know nothing was worse than
[1:39:21.240 --> 1:39:26.040]  the uh holocaust of world war two i mean what about the holocaust of the russian coolock
[1:39:26.040 --> 1:39:32.840]  farmers you know i mean what about the holocaust of more than 50 million black people of course
[1:39:32.840 --> 1:39:38.840]  exactly did you know that that about 55 percent of people in the transatlantic slave trade from
[1:39:38.840 --> 1:39:45.160]  the late uh 14 hundreds right through to the 1800s that over half the people on each ship of 400
[1:39:45.160 --> 1:39:53.240]  slaves would die exactly and even even that back to the uh the holocaust was terrible
[1:39:53.240 --> 1:39:58.680]  my point is is that it's you know it's not the worst thing that ever happened in history
[1:39:59.320 --> 1:40:03.800]  yeah i know but i mean but he's he was completely oblivious to everything you said i mean of course
[1:40:03.800 --> 1:40:08.840]  he knows you know he's he's just well my issue was is that we shouldn't take people's free speech
[1:40:09.400 --> 1:40:13.800]  and and in europe they're taking free speech to criticize the government now and that's in
[1:40:13.800 --> 1:40:17.800]  the news and he just said i was a liar well we're going to take that edcoch video of me

[1:40:29.560 --> 1:40:34.600]  of ignoramuses just thinking he's telling the truth we're going to just slamming every statement he

[1:47:57.320 --> 1:48:02.440]  show brother thank you hey man briefly i just want to let you know in uh south austin our uh
[1:48:02.440 --> 1:48:10.040]  republican convention you guys captured some uh delegate uh sectors oh yes big time um it was a
[1:48:10.040 --> 1:48:15.960]  close it was a close fight but um hot people took over the whole convention um i heard it went on for
[1:48:15.960 --> 1:48:22.120]  18 hours well the north one did um they had a little bit rougher time i think congressional
[1:48:22.120 --> 1:48:28.520]  district got taken over too didn't it yes it did it did now for those that don't know how that works
[1:48:28.520 --> 1:48:33.400]  and it's i even have studied it it's hard to understand so Byzantine uh this is a big deal
[1:48:33.400 --> 1:48:37.640]  you guys are getting to now basically write the party platform at the state level and this continues
[1:48:37.640 --> 1:48:42.680]  it can happen at the national level yeah we're gonna have ron paul anti-new world order people
[1:48:42.680 --> 1:48:46.840]  all through the machinery of the country i'm all for i think it's wonderful is there still talk
[1:48:46.840 --> 1:48:51.640]  though we're trying to go to the convention and demanding ron paul um i haven't heard much about
[1:48:51.640 --> 1:48:56.440]  that i've heard of some type of revolt on the floor possibly but i don't know what that would
[1:48:56.440 --> 1:49:01.640]  entail i'm for any revolt that stages these events i mean that exposes these staged events
[1:49:01.640 --> 1:49:07.160]  but i don't like a revolt if they try to claim that they want him for president because if you
[1:49:07.160 --> 1:49:11.960]  got 60 delegates and mccain's got over a thousand the media will crucify us for that claiming we're
[1:49:11.960 --> 1:49:16.760]  stealing people's votes with the delegates yeah people need to wake up to the truth about this
[1:49:16.760 --> 1:49:22.280]  all we've we've done what we've done i was so proud of everybody yesterday um but you know
[1:49:22.280 --> 1:49:27.000]  we got to be realistic about what's going on but well listen we got people everywhere
[1:49:28.040 --> 1:49:33.800]  in government everywhere and every the military the police and our numbers are growing and the

[1:49:38.600 --> 1:49:43.720]  is getting very serious our people are growing exponentially they're everywhere and we're going
[1:49:43.720 --> 1:49:47.400]  to defend america we're going to defend the republic and just understand new world order
[1:49:47.400 --> 1:49:54.760]  you better back off you know you know that you're in a losing scenario stage a new attack try to

[1:50:06.120 --> 1:50:11.640]  yeah i'd like to talk about um that jericho show that got canceled it's like what they do they um
[1:50:11.640 --> 1:50:17.240]  um that's like what the government and i'm posting notice in the paper about we're gonna take this
[1:50:17.240 --> 1:50:23.720]  car do this thing they do that they did that with that titan book back in the 20s or whatever
[1:50:23.720 --> 1:50:29.000]  whatever it was they did that with the lone gunman show it's like they believe that um
[1:50:29.560 --> 1:50:35.560]  the that they're that they're posting notice to the collective it's cabalistic it's it's
[1:50:35.560 --> 1:50:41.320]  yes it's cabalistic esoterica i don't believe in it but most of the elite and believe me
[1:50:41.320 --> 1:50:44.600]  you start meeting billionaires you say do you believe in black magic do you believe in and
[1:50:44.600 --> 1:50:49.240]  they'll see yes i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean these people are nuts and i i've got to
[1:50:49.240 --> 1:50:53.880]  move quick great point and yes lone gunman episode i've interviewed the people that wrote it i've
[1:50:53.880 --> 1:50:59.880]  interviewed the stars of it uh like dean hangland the cia came to them planted that story basically
[1:50:59.880 --> 1:51:04.680]  on them to do a simulation of a hijacked jet by remote control being flown to the world trade center
[1:51:05.720 --> 1:51:10.600]  in the x file show six months before nine eleven where the government then even was going to blame
[1:51:10.600 --> 1:51:15.400]  them on afghanistan and they were going to use hijacking drills to confuse norad so it stood
[1:51:15.400 --> 1:51:21.880]  down i mean the exact same thing six months before of what they really did like tom clancy
[1:51:21.880 --> 1:51:27.320]  admits the cia gives him his plots he wrote that a year before nine eleven and you'll find out uh
[1:51:27.320 --> 1:51:35.960]  the governor's brother keating's brother in oklahoma wrote a book uh and a tom mcvay bombs the
[1:51:35.960 --> 1:51:41.080]  alfred p mura building published one year before let me explain again the governor's brother
[1:51:41.800 --> 1:51:46.200]  and dedicated the book to the knights of the secret circle you might want to google and
[1:51:46.200 --> 1:51:51.320]  find out what the knights of the secret circle yes they're not very friendly pointed hats i'll
[1:51:51.320 --> 1:51:59.160]  just leave it at that oh yeah they like to brag they like to leave an ace card you're right about
[1:51:59.160 --> 1:52:03.880]  psychopaths leave mementos well these are big psychos i mean i'm sure the governor's brother
[1:52:03.880 --> 1:52:08.680]  just at just some accidents coincidence i'm sure everything's fine i mean you know he's a good guy
[1:52:08.680 --> 1:52:13.480]  and the knights of the secret circle are very friendly too uh you know that's his book not mine

[1:52:56.440 --> 1:53:01.880]  awesome he can't have that chopper on the border it's got to be on you yeah and then
[1:53:01.880 --> 1:53:05.720]  after he started coming towards me and then he was crossing a different direction and gave me a
[1:53:05.720 --> 1:53:10.840]  a quick flash and then he turned around my house and it was a full mean that night well drink fluoride

[1:53:26.680 --> 1:53:31.640]  and then bam that freaking light is shining down on me like for no reason i don't understand

[1:53:58.360 --> 1:54:05.800]  to submit to them oh it's so simple yeah uh the move the tv show jericho where the government
[1:54:05.800 --> 1:54:11.720]  nukes itself to bring in martial law and there's two ways to look at that is that them like put an
[1:54:11.720 --> 1:54:17.480]  ad in the newspaper when they're going to repossess something or imminent domain and it is you know
[1:54:17.480 --> 1:54:21.960]  vampire from legend i don't not seem to really vampire that's where that those ideas come from
[1:54:21.960 --> 1:54:26.360]  has to trick you has to tell you what it's going to has to trick you to have you invite them once
[1:54:26.360 --> 1:54:33.960]  into your house across the threshold and uh mayor negan was in a tv show called oil storm six months
[1:54:33.960 --> 1:54:40.760]  before the hurricane hit and did the exact same thing that made for tv movie did for fx but again
[1:54:40.760 --> 1:54:45.800]  it's a coincidence everything's fine the government of course patented in 68 could control and create
[1:54:45.800 --> 1:54:51.480]  hurricanes have had the father of weather weapons before it was even on the associated press on
[1:54:51.480 --> 1:54:57.240]  they can create and steer the hurricanes but everything's fine uh let's go ahead now and
[1:54:57.240 --> 1:55:03.160]  take another call steve in denver colorado you're on the air hey alex good show again today i was
[1:55:03.160 --> 1:55:08.440]  going to suggest what if we had something like a woodstock 9-11 uh big concert where we had one
[1:55:08.440 --> 1:55:12.520]  day where we had all these musicians and all these actors and famous people come together and we just
[1:55:12.520 --> 1:55:16.760]  spent one day you know i'm uh kind of helping the people with our architects and engineers
[1:55:16.760 --> 1:55:22.200]  for 9-11 truth right now we've suggested that as a media event and we could just have one major
[1:55:22.200 --> 1:55:26.280]  big event that we could videotape sell and try to show everybody how many people there are from
[1:55:26.280 --> 1:55:31.560]  the show here's the problem you know and it's like that in any society or group it would take a lot
[1:55:31.560 --> 1:55:36.680]  of groups getting involved in the groups would never agree and and also no one group i'm probably
[1:55:36.680 --> 1:55:40.680]  the only person that could actually pull it off could go out and get the celebrities because
[1:55:40.680 --> 1:55:44.920]  the celebrities don't know or don't trust because they don't know these other groups they haven't
[1:55:44.920 --> 1:55:49.000]  been around as long as i am you know the celebrities just call me up you know the phone rings and they're
[1:55:49.000 --> 1:55:53.480]  on uh and that's because they know i've been around a long time they're aware of what i've
[1:55:53.480 --> 1:55:58.520]  been doing a long time that's been batted around by people but i haven't really actively gone out
[1:55:58.520 --> 1:56:04.280]  and pushed it uh just because i couldn't imagine the headache of it all uh plus the logistics of
[1:56:04.280 --> 1:56:09.000]  trying to get people who are in rock bands or people that have national number one tv shows or
[1:56:09.000 --> 1:56:14.440]  people that are you know best actress or you know people who you know make movies about pirates or
[1:56:14.440 --> 1:56:19.720]  people who you know trying to get all these groups together to do that at one time it could probably
[1:56:19.720 --> 1:56:24.520]  be done but then people don't even want you to charge for the tickets you're supposed to rent
[1:56:24.520 --> 1:56:29.800]  some park or get someplace and it's you know a hundred thousand dollars a day you know in a big
[1:56:29.800 --> 1:56:35.000]  city like new york or la how much of building the holds 1500 is it's like 40 grand a day
[1:56:35.000 --> 1:56:40.760]  and then you get it and groups try to block you i had that la symposium with charlie sheen and a
[1:56:40.760 --> 1:56:45.640]  bunch of other big people the guy that made any of the state was there a bunch of others and uh
[1:56:45.640 --> 1:56:49.240]  people try to get that shut down they try to not you know they try to put pressure on sheridan
[1:56:49.800 --> 1:56:53.160]  and i had to basically threaten people to not let them cancel it nobody ever knew about that i'm
[1:56:53.160 --> 1:57:00.920]  telling you now so it's not fun and uh you know i'd rather just in their body blows in the new
[1:57:00.920 --> 1:57:06.120]  world order i'm um doing interviews every day on other radio shows on our websites get millions of
[1:57:06.120 --> 1:57:10.920]  visitors a week other people are coming to public we're just spreading the word and then they've
[1:57:10.920 --> 1:57:15.160]  had little wood stocks and little meetings with a few thousand people out of my hand but yeah it
[1:57:15.160 --> 1:57:21.160]  might be a good idea it'd be fun c-span carried our symposium we did heard it four times all right
