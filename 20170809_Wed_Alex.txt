[00:00:01.573 --> 00:00:14.137]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:14.137 --> 00:00:20.899]  This message is transmitted at the request of the President of the United States of America and the Office of Homeland Security.
[00:00:20.899 --> 00:00:26.241]  In compliance with the United Nations, the President of the United States has declared martial law.
[00:00:26.241 --> 00:00:27.662]  Curfew is now in place.
[00:00:27.662 --> 00:00:28.762]  Return to your homes.
[00:00:36.403 --> 00:00:41.207]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:43.189]  It's the Alex Jones Show!
[00:01:01.365 --> 00:01:07.248]  He has been very threatening beyond a normal state.
[00:01:07.248 --> 00:01:22.037]  And as I said, they will be met with fire, fury, and frankly, power, the likes of which this world has never seen before.
[00:01:22.037 --> 00:01:27.380]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this Wednesday, the ninth day of August 2017.
[00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:39.882]  I'm your host Alex Jones, and I'm not even going to get into the North Korea situation until we start the next segment because it's so dire.
[00:01:39.882 --> 00:01:52.025]  Top British newspapers, the top two papers in the UK, are telling the public prepare for nuclear war and directing them to the location of fallout shelters.
[00:01:52.025 --> 00:01:59.367]  Now there's a lot of Machiavellian angles to all of this that we're also going to be looking at, but the bottom line is this.
[00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:15.927]  Beyond McMasters and others who have been pushing for conflict with North Korea as a distraction from the fact that their coup inside the White House has been discovered.
[00:02:15.927 --> 00:02:21.250]  Separate from all of that, that doesn't take away from the fact that Kim Jong-un
[00:02:23.622 --> 00:02:34.607]  is completely delusional and out of his mind and just as bad as the corrupt globalists that we see plaguing our culture and our civilization.
[00:02:34.607 --> 00:02:52.274]  And of course, the big nuclear weapon in the room, the big elephant, is the Clintons and the globalists and their strategy of giving nuclear weapons and delivery systems to Kim Jong-un's father, Kim Jong-il.
[00:02:54.232 --> 00:03:09.136]  So really, we should be discussing the globalist policies of strategic tension, as they call it, that have brought us to this point.
[00:03:09.136 --> 00:03:13.838]  But there is no good guys and bad guys in this situation.
[00:03:13.838 --> 00:03:20.800]  When it comes to the gods of the state, North Korea is a purist and is an absolute nightmare hellhole with their poor people.
[00:03:21.783 --> 00:03:33.486]  But in many cases, being killed in a nuclear blast, if you're in a forced labor camp, being worked to death and tortured to death, would probably be some type of reprieve.
[00:03:33.486 --> 00:03:37.427]  I'm not saying I want to see a strike on North Korea.
[00:03:37.427 --> 00:03:45.589]  War's not beautiful, it's not elegant, it's not something that is to be celebrated.
[00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:47.570]  But Kim Jong-un is continually
[00:03:49.161 --> 00:03:52.644]  Threatening to nuke Seoul, South Korea, Tokyo, Japan.
[00:03:52.644 --> 00:03:57.468]  Now he's threatening preemptive strikes against Guam.
[00:03:57.468 --> 00:04:03.032]  Where we've got B-52s, nukes, you name it, cruise missiles.
[00:04:03.032 --> 00:04:12.220]  And they've got a wider range of missiles that can now hit easily as far east as Chicago, Illinois or Austin, Texas.
[00:04:15.162 --> 00:04:16.123]  Depends on how you look at it.
[00:04:16.123 --> 00:04:16.983]  It's the other side of the world.
[00:04:16.983 --> 00:04:22.887]  You could say as far west or as far east, but they would be firing their weapons at the eastern seaboard.
[00:04:22.887 --> 00:04:27.790]  They'd be firing in that direction.
[00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.994]  Merkel orders Trump calm down as North Korea crisis peaks over Guam threat.
[00:04:32.994 --> 00:04:39.638]  See, the media, CNN, all of them, are acting like it's Donald Trump's fault.
[00:04:39.638 --> 00:04:41.600]  And I'm not here as an apologist to Donald Trump.
[00:04:42.950 --> 00:05:04.145]  But North Korea is continually saying, we're going to have fire, we're going to have death, we're going to rain down destruction on you, we're going to kill you, we're going to turn the United States into a molten nuclear war zone, and then Trump comes back with one little smidgen back of that back, trying something new, as the Secretary of State pointed out, and the media acts like he gave the nuclear weapons to North Korea.
[00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:12.792]  Prepping for disaster and societal unrest has now gone so mainstream that even Realtor.com is writing about it.
[00:05:12.792 --> 00:05:22.036]  But the Realtors are still embarrassed to cover the subject and eager to set themselves apart from what they call Uncle Travis' guns and canned foods militia vision of preparedness.
[00:05:22.036 --> 00:05:24.377]  Well, the ants may have the last laugh
[00:05:24.597 --> 00:05:25.758]  On the grasshoppers.
[00:05:25.758 --> 00:05:29.020]  But the grasshoppers will still sing the tune, if they can make money.
[00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:35.706]  But maybe you don't have a Hollywood mansion where you can drop another million dollars to turn your home theater into a radiation-proof bunker.
[00:05:35.706 --> 00:05:40.189]  There are still very effective, low-tech, low-cost things you can do to prepare.
[00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:47.615]  In fact, even realizing that there's a need to prepare and doing anything to act on that realization increases your chances of survival.
[00:05:47.975 --> 00:05:56.439]  Things that you do to prepare for an Armageddon scenario will help you to weather storms, to absorb an economic shock, or to protect you from home invasion.
[00:05:56.439 --> 00:06:02.402]  Prepare for the worst-case scenario while you educate yourself and others and work for the best-case scenario.
[00:06:02.402 --> 00:06:05.284]  Get more information at InfoWars.com.
[00:06:05.284 --> 00:06:05.844]  I'm David Knight.
[00:06:07.857 --> 00:06:11.640]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:19.385]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:06:19.385 --> 00:06:28.011]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:06:28.011 --> 00:06:32.414]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:06:32.414 --> 00:06:37.377]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[00:06:37.717 --> 00:06:38.557]  We're good to go.
[00:07:06.463 --> 00:07:14.732]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the info war.
[00:07:14.732 --> 00:07:15.954]  A 360 win.
[00:07:15.954 --> 00:07:22.201]  Number one, when you choose auto ship before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at InfoWarshore.com.
[00:07:22.501 --> 00:07:30.444]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[00:07:30.444 --> 00:07:35.525]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[00:07:35.525 --> 00:07:41.607]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[00:07:41.607 --> 00:07:49.390]  Just go to InfoWareStore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on AutoShip, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:51.251]  As you know, I coined the term 360Win.
[00:07:52.031 --> 00:07:55.933]  And with the new auto ship feature at Infowarslife.com, this is a sure win.
[00:07:55.933 --> 00:07:57.574]  10% off on auto ship.
[00:07:57.574 --> 00:08:00.015]  Win, win, win at Infowarslife.com.
[00:08:00.015 --> 00:08:01.996]  Free shipping on orders above 50 bucks.
[00:08:01.996 --> 00:08:13.902]  And all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto ship.
[00:08:13.902 --> 00:08:21.266]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:08:22.623 --> 00:08:28.984]  Rallying patriots worldwide.
[00:08:28.984 --> 00:08:35.465]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:35.465 --> 00:08:47.888]  Hey you lives and interesting times, the old Chinese proverb.
[00:08:47.888 --> 00:08:50.328]  It's Wednesday, already the ninth day,
[00:08:52.156 --> 00:08:53.237]  Of August 2017.
[00:08:53.237 --> 00:09:02.345]  And it's at times like this that I don't even like being separated from my children.
[00:09:02.345 --> 00:09:06.108]  It's at times like this that I really don't want to go out of town.
[00:09:06.108 --> 00:09:13.594]  It's at times like this that I realize how mortal I am and how mortal my family is.
[00:09:13.594 --> 00:09:16.537]  And how mortal this planet is.
[00:09:16.537 --> 00:09:17.698]  Life on this planet.
[00:09:19.873 --> 00:09:22.794]  And that history repeats itself.
[00:09:22.794 --> 00:09:26.395]  History also tends to go in cycles.
[00:09:26.395 --> 00:09:29.655]  History rhymes.
[00:09:29.655 --> 00:09:37.957]  And if you look at the war that ended back on July 27th, 1953, it never officially ended.
[00:09:37.957 --> 00:09:41.458]  There on the DMZ between the North Korea and South Korea.
[00:09:45.543 --> 00:09:59.895]  This is the type of day, though, where I want to open the phones up for all of you to be able to chime in and give your response, particularly if you're in the military, or been in Korea, or in Japan, or in China, or in Guam.
[00:09:59.895 --> 00:10:02.837]  But everybody's a target of this.
[00:10:02.837 --> 00:10:12.024]  But the Korean War, the UN police action, came to a ceasefire July 27th, 1953.
[00:10:15.071 --> 00:10:18.592]  Millions died in that war.
[00:10:18.592 --> 00:10:26.195]  Millions, including over 100,000 Americans.
[00:10:26.195 --> 00:10:43.961]  And now we have a psychotic global elite that gave reactors in North Korea, allowing them to produce atomic warheads and missile secrets
[00:10:45.711 --> 00:10:49.514]  That the Communist Chinese wouldn't even give to them.
[00:10:49.514 --> 00:10:51.636]  And the strategy of tension was this.
[00:10:51.636 --> 00:11:13.475]  If the West needed an excuse to ever go to war with Red China, as it was properly called, back in the 1950s and 60s and 70s and 80s, till the political correctness came along, we're supposed to not call it that anymore, with their one-child policy and their forced abortions and the execution of Christians and harvesting their organs and Falun Gong and all the rest of it.
[00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:21.625]  But despite that warming towards China, the strategy of tension continued.
[00:11:21.625 --> 00:11:24.988]  And that's why North Korea was left there.
[00:11:24.988 --> 00:11:26.650]  That's why it's sitting there.
[00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:35.678]  Douglas MacArthur wanted to drop atomic bombs on the Chinese troops, 3 million of them, that came over the Yalu River.
[00:11:35.678 --> 00:11:37.700]  When President Truman told him no,
[00:11:43.373 --> 00:11:47.496]  The old soldier that never died but just faded away.
[00:11:47.496 --> 00:11:49.798]  As he said, old soldiers never die.
[00:11:49.798 --> 00:11:51.359]  They just fade away.
[00:11:51.359 --> 00:11:57.743]  He was removed from command.
[00:11:57.743 --> 00:12:04.108]  And the Chinese were backed up by Russia who threatened nuclear war.
[00:12:08.271 --> 00:12:10.914]  If we repulse the attack with atomic bombs.
[00:12:10.914 --> 00:12:16.138]  And why did the Soviets have atomic bombs and we're about to get the hydrogen bomb?
[00:12:16.138 --> 00:12:31.833]  Because our government, our deep state, the same folks that worked on the Manhattan Project, used the Rosenbergs as the cutout, this has all been declassified, to transfer the atomic weapons technology to the Russians.
[00:12:33.663 --> 00:12:49.181]  They had superior scientists in their own ranks and from the Germans when it came to missile delivery, payload delivery, but not when it came to the bombs themselves.
[00:12:49.181 --> 00:12:51.103]  So, the globalists!
[00:12:51.103 --> 00:12:53.687]  So we'd accept the UN and world government for world peace,
[00:12:55.154 --> 00:13:01.296]  They transferred nuclear weapons to Russia, then to China, and continued.
[00:13:01.296 --> 00:13:13.300]  You don't just think the Clintons did that in the 1990s as part of some thing they thought up to get a few million dollars into their foundation from North Korea, which they got.
[00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:16.061]  You don't just think that they did it on their own.
[00:13:16.061 --> 00:13:17.502]  They were authorized to do it.
[00:13:17.502 --> 00:13:22.283]  So I'm breaking down, ladies and gentlemen, not just the current crisis, but why we're in it.
[00:13:22.283 --> 00:13:24.324]  Why North Korea is threatening a preemptive strike.
[00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:30.752]  Against Guam, against Hawaii, against Seattle, against Chicago, against L.A.
[00:13:30.752 --> 00:13:35.414]  These are all being listed.
[00:13:35.414 --> 00:13:45.439]  Because our crazy elites propped up the grandfather of the current little demon that sits there.
[00:13:45.439 --> 00:13:50.861]  Even the New York Times admits the Clintons armed North Korea.
[00:13:50.861 --> 00:13:51.982]  But it's beyond that.
[00:13:51.982 --> 00:13:54.183]  The Clintons are scapegoats and they're horrible scapegoats.
[00:13:54.183 --> 00:13:54.703]  They're guilty.
[00:13:57.841 --> 00:14:05.283]  But they themselves are puppets!
[00:14:05.283 --> 00:14:17.806]  We have psychotic elite in control that transferred weapons to Russia, and transferred weapons to China, and transferred weapons to North Korea, and transferred weapons to everybody else!
[00:14:22.745 --> 00:14:32.528]  Because the globalists want ordered, controlled, cult-like states of absolutely servile, brainwashed minions.
[00:14:32.528 --> 00:14:41.910]  And since yesterday afternoon, I've just been giddy with the energy in the air, as this escalation went stratospheric.
[00:14:43.755 --> 00:15:05.140]  And now, I basically had the most unsettling dreams all last night, sickening dreams all last night, deeply having sorrow for my children, and the potentiality that is becoming a probability of worldwide nuclear war.
[00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:13.102]  And Joel Skousen will tell you, and he's dialed into the smartest guys out there, he's one of them, he's a smart guy, he agrees that they are planning a nuclear war.
[00:15:14.423 --> 00:15:18.989]  And then he's moved his timetable up to this year or next year now, instead of 2020.
[00:15:18.989 --> 00:15:22.533]  And he's been saying that for 15 years.
[00:15:22.533 --> 00:15:25.417]  And it's coming true.
[00:15:25.417 --> 00:15:29.942]  So, let's all... It's easy to get mad at the TSA, groping little kids.
[00:15:30.708 --> 00:15:39.595]  But then you gotta ask why'd Congress pass a law leaving the borders open to orthodox Muslims, letting them come in on terror networks, then letting them attack, and then taking all of our rights.
[00:15:39.595 --> 00:15:42.397]  I'm not going to blame the little TSA person anymore.
[00:15:42.397 --> 00:15:45.779]  I'm going to blame myself, Congress, the American people for letting it happen.
[00:15:45.779 --> 00:15:46.740]  And it's the same thing.
[00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:49.082]  We can sit here and blame North Korea all day.
[00:15:49.082 --> 00:15:56.748]  Most of the people there are total slaves, absolutely in the most hellish environment on earth in forced labor camps.
[00:15:56.748 --> 00:15:59.510]  Something like a third of the population is in forced labor camps.
[00:16:02.875 --> 00:16:11.797]  Where the morals are so whacked out and twisted that there's rules against raping a woman.
[00:16:11.797 --> 00:16:21.340]  So they'll rape the woman and then kill her.
[00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:26.961]  And the reports of where the people are so tough there that they'll chop their legs off for fun.
[00:16:26.961 --> 00:16:28.901]  The entertainment is just torturing people.
[00:16:28.901 --> 00:16:31.042]  And then people survive sometimes years
[00:16:32.588 --> 00:16:47.160]  Their legs heal and they just crawl around with no legs working in the fields.
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:53.065]  And so you can think maybe raining down hydrogen bombs on North Korea would be a gift to some people, but no, it's not.
[00:16:53.065 --> 00:16:54.086]  We can't play God.
[00:16:54.086 --> 00:16:55.107]  And here's the bigger issue.
[00:16:55.107 --> 00:16:57.109]  Here's the big takeaway from all of it.
[00:16:59.229 --> 00:17:02.511]  The globalists set this up and did this.
[00:17:02.511 --> 00:17:15.837]  Our evil elites in Europe, the United States, and the UK created communism, propped it up, put it in, gave them all the weapons, gave them our jobs, gave them our industry to prop it up.
[00:17:15.837 --> 00:17:19.118]  And we're not facing North Korea.
[00:17:19.118 --> 00:17:20.639]  We're facing China.
[00:17:24.591 --> 00:17:42.214]  And in the new strategy, Trump was trying to get China to leave this strategy of tension and to stop it and to reform and Russia, but the neocons and the globalists and the Democrats blocked Trump from his true JFK-level peace move.
[00:17:42.214 --> 00:17:51.716]  And now in this incredibly dangerous situation where we face China and Russia, things are deteriorating quicker in disputes all along.
[00:17:52.816 --> 00:18:14.280]  The 800 mile border with India and China, as India and China grab pieces of property from each other that's been disputed for a century and say they've gone to their highest level before they go into full war, which they've had wars before and both powers are nuclear!
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:17.101]  And the Indians didn't need help developing atomic weapons.
[00:18:18.407 --> 00:18:23.668]  Pakistan was given it again, allowed to by AQ Khan Laboratories.
[00:18:23.668 --> 00:18:25.309]  Under who again?
[00:18:25.309 --> 00:18:27.029]  Bill and Hillary Clinton.
[00:18:27.029 --> 00:18:28.349]  Same players.
[00:18:28.349 --> 00:18:29.550]  Same people.
[00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:30.750]  Same groups.
[00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:42.533]  But Donald Rumsfeld was involved with ABB and other companies in the transfers to Korea, North Korea, and Pakistan.
[00:18:42.533 --> 00:18:46.434]  And once the Pakistanis had the basic materials, they've built hundreds of weapons.
[00:18:47.881 --> 00:18:51.403]  They didn't need a lot of help, did they?
[00:18:51.403 --> 00:18:52.444]  So that's where we stand.
[00:18:52.444 --> 00:18:53.805]  We're gonna skip this network break.
[00:18:53.805 --> 00:18:57.827]  That's where we stand on the precipice right now.
[00:18:57.827 --> 00:19:02.130]  And so, it's not just, oh, Kim Jong-il's a horrible little dictator pig-like creature.
[00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:03.251]  I agree.
[00:19:03.251 --> 00:19:04.852]  He's nauseating.
[00:19:04.852 --> 00:19:08.814]  Those people he's got under his stinking thumb.
[00:19:08.814 --> 00:19:10.215]  I'd like to see him get his neck broken.
[00:19:11.348 --> 00:19:16.090]  A lot of people would, obviously, but transcending that, this is what evil puts on the throne.
[00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:20.092]  This is what the devil's got in store for this planet.
[00:19:20.092 --> 00:19:26.655]  Under the state god that everybody's pushing so hard for, that'll deliver us into this Valhalla.
[00:19:26.655 --> 00:19:31.917]  Into the golden Pelennor Fields of Elysium.
[00:19:31.917 --> 00:19:34.859]  But once you travel to Elysium, you find it's more like hell.
[00:19:36.431 --> 00:19:42.074]  The Greek Hades and the heaven we were supposedly going to be transported to.
[00:19:42.074 --> 00:19:51.338]  The Christian free market, open free will ethos is the fount of success and the fount of transcendence.
[00:19:51.338 --> 00:19:59.142]  And the enemy is seeking to pull it down with every ugly, stunted, wicked ideology of Islam, of communism,
[00:20:00.891 --> 00:20:11.156]  Force-feeding it with an icing of sexualization and pedophilia against our children.
[00:20:11.156 --> 00:20:22.541]  I should probably get a live mic in here and just walk over to the world map I've got, section by section here, of the continents and the countries, and point out the grand strategies, the grand chessboard.
[00:20:24.036 --> 00:20:32.702]  We're putting in a new studio with TV walls twice the size of what we've got in here so I can walk with PowerPoint and show people in daily briefings what we're dealing with here.
[00:20:32.702 --> 00:20:35.304]  So we can properly go over this for folks.
[00:20:35.304 --> 00:20:44.671]  Because on screen and on the walls and all around us is the planet, the ship we're on in deep space.
[00:20:44.671 --> 00:20:46.312]  And we've got people running the ship
[00:20:47.193 --> 00:20:52.958]  That are pedophiles, that are devil worshippers, and that have handed out nuclear weapons to everybody, but it's worse.
[00:20:52.958 --> 00:20:59.843]  Now their genetic engineering is spreading.
[00:20:59.843 --> 00:21:12.333]  And we're out here like if we were a science fiction movie, like some weapons colony, some weapons test, where some dangerous species has been put out in a primitive form on a planet
[00:21:13.285 --> 00:21:18.549]  For somebody's entertainment to watch if we can survive and what we do once we get to this level.
[00:21:18.549 --> 00:21:20.751]  We have an ancestral memory of technology.
[00:21:20.751 --> 00:21:25.995]  All the legends, all the information, all the understanding, the epigenetics.
[00:21:25.995 --> 00:21:27.756]  We know we've been in space.
[00:21:27.756 --> 00:21:29.418]  We know we're advanced.
[00:21:29.418 --> 00:21:32.480]  We know it's all just this memory that's there.
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:33.981]  We all know what we can build.
[00:21:33.981 --> 00:21:36.903]  We all know what we can do.
[00:21:36.903 --> 00:21:38.425]  And now we're sitting here
[00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:46.671]  On the face of this whole thing, I'll probably do it next segment, thanks, that was quick.
[00:21:46.671 --> 00:21:56.453]  Sitting here on this planet with this incredible potential of space colonies and life extension and unlimited cloning.
[00:21:56.453 --> 00:22:02.274]  And we got people running things that want Kim Jong-un in charge.
[00:22:02.274 --> 00:22:05.054]  And who want the communist Chinese in charge.
[00:22:05.054 --> 00:22:07.915]  Our CIA put them in power in 1949.
[00:22:11.798 --> 00:22:17.943]  And this global force wants to put dangerous, tainted vaccines where it's been discovered in the U.N.
[00:22:17.943 --> 00:22:18.683]  files.
[00:22:18.683 --> 00:22:19.764]  They're adding sterilants.
[00:22:19.764 --> 00:22:21.505]  They're adding cancer viruses.
[00:22:21.505 --> 00:22:23.887]  And you wonder why our life expectancy is going down.
[00:22:23.887 --> 00:22:26.509]  You wonder why infant mortality is skyrocketing.
[00:22:26.509 --> 00:22:32.113]  Why pediatric cancers are something like 15,000 times worse than they were on average.
[00:22:32.113 --> 00:22:32.313]  Plus 10,000.
[00:22:32.313 --> 00:22:35.576]  Diabetes, type 2, 3,000 plus increase for the 1960s.
[00:22:35.576 --> 00:22:37.597]  Type 1, multi-thousand increase.
[00:22:42.432 --> 00:22:47.594]  So-called genetic.
[00:22:47.594 --> 00:22:54.257]  We're being killed by whatever it is in charge and manipulating.
[00:22:54.257 --> 00:23:06.722]  And the thing in charge wants us to take microchips to buy and sell, it's now on the news, is building a worldwide AI system of computers that will project its three-dimensional image into
[00:23:09.977 --> 00:23:29.471]  The seats of power into the shopping malls, into the town squares, and we will worship the AI, because it's going to know when we're going to order something from Amazon before we do, and it's going to know when we're going to get cancer before we do, and it's going to save us, but we have to give up our humanity to be saved.
[00:23:29.471 --> 00:23:32.854]  We have to give up our humanity to have a baby, but it won't be a baby.
[00:23:35.774 --> 00:23:44.157]  It'll be a new humanoid with five daddies or five mommies, because you can't have a human in this new system.
[00:23:44.157 --> 00:23:46.658]  It can only be humanoid.
[00:23:46.658 --> 00:23:52.380]  The crime will be being male, the crime will be female, the crime will be male and female in union.
[00:23:52.380 --> 00:24:02.644]  They sold you on the sexual revolution in the free love of men and women, and then once they had you there, by successive approximation, they walked you into the gates of hell.
[00:24:04.739 --> 00:24:18.351]  Using the weapon of open free society, using the fact that we don't want to hurt anybody's feelings, they can successfully walk us into total genetic and cultural and species doom.
[00:24:18.351 --> 00:24:25.558]  But the doom is not reserved for just the humans.
[00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:29.283]  Everything will be defiled.
[00:24:29.283 --> 00:24:31.145]  Everything will be twisted.
[00:24:31.145 --> 00:24:33.347]  Everything will be mixed.
[00:24:33.347 --> 00:24:35.229]  Everything will be deformed.
[00:24:35.229 --> 00:24:47.943]  Everything will be made hideous and crying out for destruction before the force is allowed to finally kill everything on the planet.
[00:24:49.053 --> 00:25:01.396]  But because of free will, the life must be turned upside down and must beg for its delivery into death.
[00:25:01.396 --> 00:25:05.517]  But it will never get that far.
[00:25:05.517 --> 00:25:07.597]  Because God will spare flesh.
[00:25:07.597 --> 00:25:10.338]  But if God didn't intervene, there would be no flesh spared.
[00:25:12.995 --> 00:25:16.218]  You're gonna look back on these days as happy days.
[00:25:16.218 --> 00:25:21.662]  Halcyon azure skies.
[00:25:21.662 --> 00:25:26.325]  You're gonna look back on this time.
[00:25:26.325 --> 00:25:36.814]  Screwing around, playing your video games, not fulfilling your destiny, not feeling fulfilled.
[00:25:36.814 --> 00:25:41.057]  You're gonna look back and you're gonna beg on your knees to God.
[00:25:44.537 --> 00:26:09.214]  That you never would have done the things you did, those of you that serve this, but you're going to realize you don't deserve redemption in the end because you went too far and you spit in the face of life and you spit in the face of everything good and you're going to turn and go the direction you meant you were destined to go because it's what you chose and that is spiritual
[00:26:11.314 --> 00:26:21.585]  Cultural, genetic, oblivion.
[00:26:21.585 --> 00:26:23.988]  And that's the force of oblivion.
[00:26:23.988 --> 00:26:30.755]  Willing itself to death, willing itself to suicide, broadcasting, screeching, howling,
[00:26:33.564 --> 00:26:44.027]  Tornado level freight trade of... That's why you go out to these anti-Trump rallies.
[00:26:44.027 --> 00:26:47.168]  It's not that Trump's perfect, but they sense there's life force.
[00:26:47.168 --> 00:26:49.829]  They sense there's someone that doesn't want to destroy everything there.
[00:26:49.829 --> 00:26:51.269]  They sense there's prosperity.
[00:26:51.269 --> 00:26:54.630]  They sense there's something of strength.
[00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:59.132]  An idea of majesty.
[00:26:59.132 --> 00:27:00.372]  Of human majesty.
[00:27:02.742 --> 00:27:03.803]  Made in the image of God.
[00:27:03.803 --> 00:27:05.644]  That's majesty.
[00:27:05.644 --> 00:27:17.394]  And there's just a... Hell's right there and the gate's starting to lift.
[00:27:19.045 --> 00:27:25.366]  And people sense it, and then there's a few reprieves and a few nationalist movements and Christian movements and populist movements.
[00:27:25.366 --> 00:27:26.907]  And just look what they're doing to the children.
[00:27:26.907 --> 00:27:30.187]  Look how they're preparing the radical Islam for us.
[00:27:30.187 --> 00:27:31.868]  Look at the cashless society.
[00:27:31.868 --> 00:27:32.668]  Look at everything.
[00:27:32.668 --> 00:27:33.568]  Look at what they're doing.
[00:27:33.568 --> 00:27:36.589]  Look at the cancer rates.
[00:27:36.589 --> 00:27:40.610]  And so as the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord lifts up a standard against it.
[00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:45.030]  But then the hordes of the earth cry out and say, No!
[00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:47.011]  We don't want a reprieve!
[00:27:47.952 --> 00:27:53.697]  We want Barabbas!
[00:27:53.697 --> 00:27:56.299]  We don't want Jonah.
[00:27:56.299 --> 00:27:58.981]  We don't want Christ.
[00:27:58.981 --> 00:28:01.904]  We don't want Moses.
[00:28:01.904 --> 00:28:03.145]  We don't want any of it.
[00:28:03.145 --> 00:28:06.988]  We want the devil!
[00:28:06.988 --> 00:28:10.551]  Now give us the devil!
[00:28:10.551 --> 00:28:14.134]  Because we're jealous.
[00:28:14.134 --> 00:28:16.456]  And existentially angry.
[00:28:17.651 --> 00:28:20.054]  The goodness and the beauty.
[00:28:20.054 --> 00:28:34.473]  Because once they get you to be selfish, once they get you to be immature, once they get you to feel like you're ugly and stunted and to embrace it, embrace your evil side, then you see the strength and the honor and the will as twisted and as fallen.
[00:28:39.966 --> 00:28:44.752]  And then you wage war against it because the two cannot coexist.
[00:28:44.752 --> 00:28:47.034]  The globalists tell us coexist with them.
[00:28:47.034 --> 00:28:49.757]  They're not going to coexist with us.
[00:28:49.757 --> 00:28:52.140]  They're not going to let you have anything.
[00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:58.067]  They're going to suck your intellect out, use you, defame you, defile you.
[00:28:59.218 --> 00:29:06.760]  desecrate you, vandalize you, before they tear you into a thousand pieces.
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:24.564]  And the monster tearing you to pieces is already halfway down the throat of the next big monster behind him, and the next, and the next, and the next, and there at the end of the line is that old serpent Satan, right there at the switch, shoving his own legs right into the meat grinder.
[00:29:24.564 --> 00:29:27.245]  Well, I'm not going down that chute with him.
[00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:30.902]  But I'll tell you one thing, I've seen enough of the devil.
[00:29:30.902 --> 00:29:34.585]  And I'm kinda like the devil.
[00:29:34.585 --> 00:29:35.686]  I've been there.
[00:29:35.686 --> 00:29:37.148]  I've seen it.
[00:29:37.148 --> 00:29:39.750]  Every night when I go to sleep.
[00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:41.712]  Every night.
[00:29:41.712 --> 00:29:46.536]  Every night I get to get my little visits.
[00:29:46.536 --> 00:29:49.338]  And it ain't a visit from old Saint Nick.
[00:29:49.338 --> 00:29:51.921]  The devil's real and he wants to kill you.
[00:29:51.921 --> 00:29:54.103]  And he's visiting you every moment as well.
[00:29:55.683 --> 00:29:59.612]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:59.612 --> 00:30:02.298]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:07.816 --> 00:30:09.296]  December 23rd, 1776.
[00:30:09.296 --> 00:30:13.278]  These are the times that try men's souls.
[00:30:13.278 --> 00:30:18.279]  The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country.
[00:30:18.279 --> 00:30:23.080]  But he that stands by it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman.
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:25.701]  Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered.
[00:30:25.701 --> 00:30:27.782]  Yet we have this consolation with us.
[00:30:27.782 --> 00:30:30.722]  At the heart of the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.
[00:30:30.722 --> 00:30:33.743]  What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly.
[00:30:33.743 --> 00:30:36.384]  It is dearness only that gives everything its value.
[00:30:36.704 --> 00:30:45.426]  Heaven knows how to put a proper price on its goods, and it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as freedom should not be highly rated.
[00:30:45.426 --> 00:30:53.788]  Britain, with an army to enforce her tyranny, has declared that she has a right not only to tax, but to bind us in all cases whatsoever.
[00:30:53.788 --> 00:30:59.049]  And if being bound in that matter is not slavery, then there is no such thing as slavery upon Earth.
[00:30:59.049 --> 00:31:04.030]  Even the expression is impious, for so unlimited a power can only belong to God.
[00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:07.551]  Thomas Paine, The American Crisis.
[00:31:07.551 --> 00:31:16.615]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.

[00:31:25.018 --> 00:31:29.900]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[00:33:07.592 --> 00:33:12.474]  This program contains language and sequences some viewers may find disturbing.
[00:33:14.051 --> 00:33:21.294]  The nation and all of our freedoms hang by a thread, and the military apparatus of this country is about to be handed over to scum!
[00:33:21.294 --> 00:33:23.334]  Lord behold it to scum!
[00:33:23.334 --> 00:33:25.055]  Russian scum!
[00:33:25.055 --> 00:33:29.457]  Listen.
[00:33:29.457 --> 00:33:33.538]  Please listen.
[00:33:33.538 --> 00:33:35.299]  If you don't, if you won't,
[00:33:36.351 --> 00:33:41.979]  If you fail to understand, then the same incredible terror that's menacing me will strike at you!
[00:33:41.979 --> 00:33:46.286]  The function of all life is survival.
[00:33:46.286 --> 00:33:48.148]  Sleep.
[00:33:48.148 --> 00:33:50.131]  Sleep.
[00:33:50.131 --> 00:33:50.412]  Sleep.
[00:33:53.769 --> 00:33:54.249]  Lock the door!
[00:33:54.249 --> 00:33:55.149]  They're coming!
[00:33:55.149 --> 00:33:56.310]  They're coming!
[00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:57.010]  Help!
[00:33:57.010 --> 00:33:57.730]  Help!
[00:33:57.730 --> 00:33:58.670]  They're coming!
[00:33:58.670 --> 00:33:59.390]  They're coming!
[00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:00.351]  Listen to me!
[00:34:00.351 --> 00:34:00.991]  Listen!
[00:34:00.991 --> 00:34:02.151]  Help me!
[00:34:02.151 --> 00:34:02.711]  You're next!
[00:34:02.711 --> 00:34:03.391]  Please!
[00:34:03.391 --> 00:34:03.992]  Please!
[00:34:03.992 --> 00:34:04.512]  You're next!
[00:34:04.512 --> 00:34:05.572]  They're in danger!
[00:34:05.572 --> 00:34:06.472]  Please listen to me!
[00:34:06.472 --> 00:34:07.632]  It's something terrible!
[00:34:07.632 --> 00:34:08.513]  Please!
[00:34:08.513 --> 00:34:08.913]  You're next!
[00:34:08.913 --> 00:34:10.513]  They're already here!
[00:34:10.513 --> 00:34:11.813]  Help!
[00:34:11.813 --> 00:34:13.014]  You're next!
[00:34:13.014 --> 00:34:13.634]  They're coming!
[00:34:13.634 --> 00:34:15.334]  They're coming!
[00:34:15.334 --> 00:34:16.155]  Sleep.
[00:34:16.155 --> 00:34:17.295]  The seed is planted.
[00:34:17.295 --> 00:34:19.235]  Sleep.
[00:34:19.235 --> 00:34:20.176]  Sleep.
[00:34:20.176 --> 00:34:21.536]  Terror grows.
[00:34:21.536 --> 00:34:21.696]  Sleep.
[00:34:22.276 --> 00:34:23.797]  Elizabeth, wake up!
[00:34:23.797 --> 00:34:25.338]  That's you when you sleep!
[00:34:25.338 --> 00:34:26.780]  Sit up!
[00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:30.402]  Invasion of the body snatchers.
[00:34:30.402 --> 00:34:32.624]  All of a sudden, they're growing like parasites.
[00:34:32.624 --> 00:34:34.045]  Is it contagious?
[00:34:34.045 --> 00:34:34.806]  Mom!
[00:34:34.806 --> 00:34:36.027]  Rihanna, help me!
[00:34:36.027 --> 00:34:37.068]  It looked right at me.
[00:34:37.068 --> 00:34:38.008]  You need to get out!
[00:34:38.008 --> 00:34:42.452]  You're looking at it as if it was human, but we're not human.
[00:34:42.452 --> 00:34:45.714]  Now, the classic fear begins to grow.
[00:34:45.714 --> 00:34:47.776]  We're being cornered!
[00:34:47.776 --> 00:34:50.818]  In a modern masterpiece of science fiction.
[00:34:50.818 --> 00:34:51.379]  Hey, Barry.
[00:34:54.211 --> 00:35:21.731]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[00:35:22.748 --> 00:35:26.111]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:35:26.111 --> 00:35:48.427]  Notice that Keith Uberman and his other counterpart floating around over there, Mr. Maddow, all the rest of them, notice that they're now calling themselves the resistance and even using the same iconography because they are not the resistance.
[00:35:48.427 --> 00:35:51.509]  They're the globalists, they're the establishment, they the man.
[00:35:54.113 --> 00:36:00.234]  And they represent the same scum that armed North Korea.
[00:36:00.234 --> 00:36:03.575]  It's an incontrovertible, indisputed fact, but that doesn't matter.
[00:36:03.575 --> 00:36:06.375]  The whole world's on the verge of nuclear war right now.
[00:36:06.375 --> 00:36:22.158]  Doesn't matter if North Korea every day threatens to nuke Japan, nuke South Korea, nuke the U.S., nuke the protectorate, Guam, the possession, the territorial possession of the United States.
[00:36:24.608 --> 00:36:28.972]  The most westerly possession of the United States?
[00:36:28.972 --> 00:36:30.012]  That means you the citizens?
[00:36:30.012 --> 00:36:39.560]  Remember, we the people, right?
[00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:52.110]  No, ladies and gentlemen, we get to hear that Paul Manafort, that's right, he got raided about two weeks ago, on July 26th,
[00:36:57.941 --> 00:37:01.406]  Isn't that just cute?
[00:37:01.406 --> 00:37:09.598]  FBI conducted pre-dawn raid of former Trump campaign chairman Manafort's home.
[00:37:12.054 --> 00:37:25.336]  FBI agents raided the Alexandria home of President Trump's former campaign chairman late last month, using a search warrant to seize documents and other materials according to people familiar with the special counsel investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.
[00:37:25.336 --> 00:37:34.318]  From what I heard, he had agreed to send them all the documents, but none of it was Russian meddling.
[00:37:34.318 --> 00:37:39.019]  It was when he worked for the Ukrainian government in a pro-US capacity.
[00:37:39.898 --> 00:37:50.303]  It's kind of like the other guys they've had on national TV that worked on the Trump campaign, who were in the CIA, you name it, propping up Yeltsin, and now they're getting subpoenaed and called before the committee.
[00:37:50.303 --> 00:37:57.746]  And then the committees keep it secret, won't let them release it, but then they leak disinfo that isn't true.
[00:37:57.746 --> 00:38:07.730]  Manafort, now there it is in the New York Times, had been voluntarily producing documents from congressional committees investigating Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election.
[00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:09.191]  But see, they didn't find what they needed to.
[00:38:11.835 --> 00:38:27.944]  So now they've moved on to just, like they said back in mid-July, oh, we're not just looking at Russia now, we're looking at checks, we're looking at deposits, we're looking at taxes, we're looking to see if anybody in the Trump entourage didn't pay all their taxes.
[00:38:27.944 --> 00:38:38.149]  Oh, a giant, across the board, bigger than anything Nixon ever dreamed of, FBI IRS dragnet.
[00:38:38.149 --> 00:38:40.871]  And so Trump said, I'm gonna fire you.
[00:38:42.134 --> 00:38:46.257]  If you get outside the stupid Russia thing and start some dragnet.
[00:38:46.257 --> 00:38:56.365]  The next day, the Democrat operative with 99.8% of the money his law firm gives goes to Hillary.
[00:38:56.365 --> 00:38:59.167]  Almost everybody on his little kangaroo group are Democrats.
[00:38:59.167 --> 00:39:00.788]  Some of them fired by Trump.
[00:39:00.788 --> 00:39:03.250]  Talk about conflicts of interest from the Justice Department.
[00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:06.542]  They go, oh, we're not really looking at Russia now.
[00:39:06.542 --> 00:39:09.504]  Notice that kind of started fading down a little bit.
[00:39:09.504 --> 00:39:15.409]  They're still saying it so you don't notice, but they moved on to any crime, any money laundering.
[00:39:15.409 --> 00:39:16.810]  Well, they can call money laundering.
[00:39:16.810 --> 00:39:27.038]  I've seen cases where somebody bounces a check or on a financial form says they have more money or less money than they actually had when they're buying a house.
[00:39:29.192 --> 00:39:31.414]  Now, you're sitting there buying a car, buying a house, doing a credit check.
[00:39:31.414 --> 00:39:33.015]  They go, how much do you make a year?
[00:39:33.015 --> 00:39:34.616]  And you go, oh, I make this.
[00:39:34.616 --> 00:39:45.984]  Well, the FBI will go find that and say, look, six years ago on a form buying a car, you lied on a federal document!
[00:39:45.984 --> 00:39:47.986]  What are they doing to Benjamin Netanyahu?
[00:39:47.986 --> 00:39:56.472]  Forget if you love him, hate him, whatever, are pragmatic about Netanyahu, like I am.
[00:39:56.472 --> 00:39:57.313]  They got his wife.
[00:39:58.524 --> 00:40:07.792]  Indicted or facing indictment for cell phone bills that weren't to government people or cleaning crews at her house.
[00:40:07.792 --> 00:40:09.954]  He's the Prime Minister of Israel!
[00:40:09.954 --> 00:40:13.357]  I mean, imagine the next thing.
[00:40:13.357 --> 00:40:15.920]  Oh my gosh, Trump!
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:22.886]  You know, let's look and see if Ivanka has any cleaning crews paid for by the government cleaning her condo at Trump Tower.
[00:40:25.643 --> 00:40:26.924]  Remember Colonel Schaffer?
[00:40:26.924 --> 00:40:30.706]  When he exposed the government wouldn't kill Bin Laden and was backing Al-Qaeda and protecting him?
[00:40:30.706 --> 00:40:34.968]  Heading up the anti-Al-Qaeda group in the army?
[00:40:34.968 --> 00:40:37.690]  They talked about indicting him.
[00:40:37.690 --> 00:40:44.214]  The numbers were like $24 in cell phone bills that weren't to the Pentagon but were to his wife.
[00:40:44.214 --> 00:40:49.897]  And they actually said he may have taken pencils home.
[00:40:49.897 --> 00:40:50.597]  That's right, they said.
[00:40:50.597 --> 00:40:53.419]  I mean, the guy's so clean.
[00:40:53.419 --> 00:40:54.120]  Pencils?
[00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:57.302]  And cell phone bills.
[00:40:57.302 --> 00:41:01.246]  To his wife.
[00:41:01.246 --> 00:41:02.447]  That's what they got.
[00:41:02.447 --> 00:41:04.449]  And they dropped it because it was so dumb.
[00:41:04.449 --> 00:41:07.952]  They were set to indict him though.
[00:41:07.952 --> 00:41:08.853]  We gotta look that up.
[00:41:11.155 --> 00:41:13.257]  Look up Colonel Schaefer under criminal investigation.
[00:41:13.257 --> 00:41:15.358]  It was like 2003.
[00:41:15.358 --> 00:41:16.239]  They were having hearings.
[00:41:16.239 --> 00:41:17.199]  He testified secretly.
[00:41:17.199 --> 00:41:18.821]  They got real mad.
[00:41:18.821 --> 00:41:20.882]  And so they then were going to try to indict him.
[00:41:20.882 --> 00:41:27.747]  It was in the news like, he had a cell phone bill where 20-something dollars was to his wife and 40-something dollars was to his mom.
[00:41:27.747 --> 00:41:28.988]  It was stuff like that.
[00:41:28.988 --> 00:41:30.950]  And I was just reading this in the newspaper.
[00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:32.651]  What?
[00:41:32.651 --> 00:41:38.355]  Yeah, we've got cell phone bills that might total over $100 and under federal law that's stealing.
[00:41:38.355 --> 00:41:39.116]  We may indict him.
[00:41:40.017 --> 00:41:47.803]  You called your mama!
[00:41:47.803 --> 00:42:01.993]  So, we've got the Clintons giving nuclear weapons, the reactors to create the fissile material, and we've got them giving them the missile secrets and empowering them and sending Jimmy Carter over there and all this stuff, and that's okay.
[00:42:06.428 --> 00:42:06.848]  There it is.
[00:42:06.848 --> 00:42:09.310]  There's the Inspector General's case number.
[00:42:09.310 --> 00:42:12.212]  I guess they closed it in 2006 for his cell phone use.
[00:42:12.212 --> 00:42:13.893]  Yes.
[00:42:13.893 --> 00:42:14.713]  The internet's incredible.
[00:42:14.713 --> 00:42:17.335]  We just pulled it right up.
[00:42:17.335 --> 00:42:20.857]  Hell, why don't they execute Tony Schafer for that?
[00:42:20.857 --> 00:42:28.041]  But this is how they operate, and it's the same thing with Benjamin Netanyahu's wife.
[00:42:28.041 --> 00:42:29.282]  Yeah.
[00:42:29.282 --> 00:42:29.422]  Yeah.
[00:42:31.033 --> 00:42:32.314]  Oh, and dinners, too!
[00:42:32.314 --> 00:42:35.977]  Dinners paid for by the government, where everyone there wasn't from the government!
[00:42:35.977 --> 00:42:36.858]  Oh my gosh!
[00:42:36.858 --> 00:42:40.701]  The Prime Minister, the President of Israel had dinners!
[00:42:40.701 --> 00:42:43.824]  And some of his friends were there, and the taxpayers paid for the dinners.
[00:42:43.824 --> 00:42:47.067]  What do you think the dinners at the White House are?
[00:42:47.067 --> 00:42:53.572]  When Oprah Winfrey or, you know, Madonna's there.
[00:42:53.572 --> 00:42:56.835]  And there it is, Attorney General, indict Sarah Netanyahu.
[00:42:56.835 --> 00:42:59.257]  And then y'all was reading the hundreds of things they're listing, it's like,
[00:43:02.188 --> 00:43:04.009]  A piece of silverware came up missing.
[00:43:04.009 --> 00:43:07.049]  Oh my gosh.
[00:43:07.049 --> 00:43:13.171]  This is, but meanwhile, the Clintons stole all the cutlery and all the plates out of the White House and then had to give them back.
[00:43:13.171 --> 00:43:16.392]  Remember that at the George Washington stuff?
[00:43:16.392 --> 00:43:19.873]  Charity be indicted for using public funds for personal expenses.
[00:43:19.873 --> 00:43:20.834]  Let's just move on.
[00:43:20.834 --> 00:43:23.554]  And I'm not even defending Netanyahu.
[00:43:23.554 --> 00:43:25.035]  It's not about Netanyahu.
[00:43:26.266 --> 00:43:32.251]  It's about the Clintons have billions of dollars stolen and given to them by foreign governments to sell out U.S.
[00:43:32.251 --> 00:43:45.242]  interests while she was the Secretary of State, where you basically walk up to a computer window via email, tell them what you want, they give you the money, and then she changes the policy, countermanding Obama.
[00:43:45.242 --> 00:43:47.163]  Talk about deep state.
[00:43:47.163 --> 00:43:52.148]  Our government's so corrupt that you've just got rogue elements running their own thieving operations everywhere.
[00:43:52.848 --> 00:43:57.434]  It's pretty much normal now to have all these different factions that are not just ignoring Trump.
[00:43:57.434 --> 00:44:01.719]  That's what they do separate from Trump.
[00:44:01.719 --> 00:44:07.887]  And a president just kind of feeds a pack of wild dogs and tries to keep them at bay and tries to kiss all their butts.
[00:44:07.887 --> 00:44:09.829]  That's what normally goes on with a Barack Obama.
[00:44:10.845 --> 00:44:12.486]  With a Hillary Clinton, it's totally different.
[00:44:12.486 --> 00:44:16.750]  She's in there organizing all the fraud and making sure it flows through her.
[00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:37.729]  Shepard, while Obama played golf and did photo ops, she was the president, that's admitted, running the State Department that basically controls all the other agencies, putting in all her people and then just swindling everything, but also trying to shut down our economy as much as she could because, you know, she's got that bull-like instinct to keep her slave that she's pimpin' down.
[00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:45.786]  You don't let one ant stand up, because if one ant stands up, they might all stand up.
[00:44:45.786 --> 00:44:53.213]  And then, those puny ants outnumber us 100 to 1.
[00:44:53.213 --> 00:44:55.075]  So, this is the level we're reaching.
[00:44:55.075 --> 00:44:57.638]  So, let me give you the big takeaway from my perspective here.
[00:44:59.957 --> 00:45:02.018]  We're facing China and Russia.
[00:45:02.018 --> 00:45:05.720]  Trump had tried to cut Russia out of the deal and get them to back us.
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:10.043]  Russia was ready to do it, but the globalists have put the kibosh on that one.
[00:45:10.043 --> 00:45:11.624]  China's kind of ambivalent.
[00:45:11.624 --> 00:45:14.706]  North Korea is out of control, more and more not even doing what they say.
[00:45:14.706 --> 00:45:15.947]  There are real sanctions.
[00:45:15.947 --> 00:45:18.068]  This is really coming to a head, but it's out of control.
[00:45:18.068 --> 00:45:21.150]  McMaster wants to be in charge of political diversion from his problems.
[00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:23.211]  He's pushing for preemptive strikes.
[00:45:23.211 --> 00:45:29.435]  That then gives Kim Jong-un the excuse to act like that, and the whole thing is just out of control.
[00:45:31.581 --> 00:45:38.784]  But then you get the political piggybacking when Trump had nothing to do with this, and Merkel saying, settle down, Trump.
[00:45:38.784 --> 00:45:41.286]  No, you settle down, you communist appeaser.
[00:45:41.286 --> 00:45:44.707]  Both your parents, dirty communist.
[00:45:44.707 --> 00:45:52.231]  Collaborators at the fall of Germany, putting in the Russian control in East Germany, just as bad as the Nazis in many respects.
[00:45:54.224 --> 00:46:00.289]  Like a weird Nazi-Communist amalgamation made a real nasty combination there, didn't it?
[00:46:00.289 --> 00:46:01.810]  Real stinky thing.
[00:46:01.810 --> 00:46:02.891]  But here we go.
[00:46:02.891 --> 00:46:09.717]  FBI conducted pre-dawn raid of former Trump campaign chairman and Roger Stone's joining us exclusively.
[00:46:09.717 --> 00:46:12.660]  Former business partners with him.
[00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:15.022]  Pretty much, you know, really good buddies.
[00:46:15.022 --> 00:46:21.447]  You're gonna get the real scoop on this exclusively.
[00:46:21.447 --> 00:46:22.228]  But quite frankly,
[00:46:23.652 --> 00:46:24.633]  What does this signify?
[00:46:24.633 --> 00:46:26.734]  What's the takeaway here?
[00:46:26.734 --> 00:46:52.611]  That the coup against Trump is going from a trot, to a gallop, to an all-out, pedal-to-the-metal, bloody-your-spurs, yeah, mule, over-the-edge-of-the-cliff craziness, with a totally political, totally corrupt, completely partisan, total conflict of interest like nothing I've ever seen,
[00:46:53.755 --> 00:46:59.417]  It'd be like if you were divorcing your wife or husband and they were the divorce court judges, I've said, over their own case.
[00:46:59.417 --> 00:47:07.900]  It's textbook crazy!
[00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:17.024]  Just like a Google executive employee manager puts out a very well-penned deal saying, look, we're not advancing people according to how good they are.
[00:47:17.024 --> 00:47:20.285]  We're doing it, political correctness, and it's messing things up.
[00:47:22.506 --> 00:47:25.574]  And I'll take anybody from any pool we can get.
[00:47:25.574 --> 00:47:28.703]  There's a larger pool of male engineers.
[00:47:28.703 --> 00:47:30.046]  And, you know, we need these people.
[00:47:30.046 --> 00:47:30.948]  And so he's fired.
[00:47:33.183 --> 00:47:35.365]  You see, first they say, oh, just ban Nazis.
[00:47:35.365 --> 00:47:36.926]  Pretty soon it's banning everybody.
[00:47:36.926 --> 00:47:52.959]  We just got banned off a big web sharing service deal where I wanted to be able to share ads for our local radio stations on our platforms and basically pay for them, but also have them become self-generating and actually have a way to have affiliate agreements to help our stations.
[00:47:52.959 --> 00:47:57.123]  And they told us, oh, you have the potential to be bigoted.
[00:47:57.583 --> 00:48:01.647]  So, you're not allowed, and it's a total lawsuit, but do I have the time to do it?
[00:48:01.647 --> 00:48:06.111]  At a certain point, I keep saying I'm going to have to file some lawsuits.
[00:48:06.111 --> 00:48:08.634]  We're writing a story about it right now.
[00:48:08.634 --> 00:48:12.057]  I mean, I have to threaten Google, publicly and privately, with lawsuits.
[00:48:12.057 --> 00:48:15.641]  They have to get letters from me now just to back off and not ban us.
[00:48:17.588 --> 00:48:19.249]  You go, oh, we'll just go to another platform.
[00:48:19.249 --> 00:48:21.510]  They're gonna go to everybody's platform next.
[00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:23.972]  We gotta hold them and fight them on their territory.
[00:48:23.972 --> 00:48:25.093]  Ever heard that before?
[00:48:25.093 --> 00:48:26.934]  Gotta fight them over there instead of over here?
[00:48:26.934 --> 00:48:37.460]  We gotta fight them at Google, fight them at YouTube, they're a creature, fight them on Facebook, fight them on Twitter, fight them on Dig, fight them on Reddit, fight them, fight them, fight them, fight them, fight them!
[00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:45.185]  Yes, we're dug in here with our own systems and trying to build them and expand them, and trying to get out every way we can, but for every tentacle I grow, they cut one off.
[00:48:45.965 --> 00:48:50.448]  I'm trying to shoot out as many spores as I can, as many heads, or hacking my heads off.
[00:48:50.448 --> 00:48:52.030]  I'm growing them faster and faster.
[00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:53.251]  Hack one off, two more pop out.
[00:48:53.251 --> 00:48:54.432]  Hack those off, six more.
[00:48:54.432 --> 00:48:59.595]  They hack those, I mean... And I'm not complaining, but I mean, we're in a fight here!
[00:48:59.595 --> 00:49:01.637]  I got like two battle-axes fighting them.
[00:49:01.637 --> 00:49:02.678]  They're hacking at me.
[00:49:02.678 --> 00:49:03.638]  We're like, ahhh!
[00:49:03.638 --> 00:49:05.240]  We're not even thinking about who's winning.
[00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:06.180]  That's when you know you're in a fight.
[00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:07.161]  You ain't thinking about winning.
[00:49:07.161 --> 00:49:08.142]  You're thinking about surviving.
[00:49:14.189 --> 00:49:15.890]  That's where we are, okay.
[00:49:15.890 --> 00:49:24.595]  So, nuclear war, top British newspapers say, find out, you know, your nuclear fallout shelter, that's on Infowars.com.
[00:49:24.595 --> 00:49:40.124]  They're accelerating their incredible witch hunt, because there is no Russia stuff, so they now just want to have a criminal investigation show that it just looks bad, and then, you know, have this grand jury indict Trump when they're 90 plus percent Democrat voters in the District of Criminals.
[00:49:44.116 --> 00:49:46.778]  And just, oh look, indictments, oh FBI raids.
[00:49:46.778 --> 00:49:50.561]  But we never saw those FBI raids.
[00:49:50.561 --> 00:49:52.083]  We never saw those indictments.
[00:49:54.821 --> 00:50:18.022]  We never saw anything with Clintons, and Lynch, and the corruption, and the Chinese generals inside the White House, and the missile secrets, and the cattle futures, and the dead bodies, and the foundation, and the Haiti looting, and the emails, and the illegal server, and the communications from all these foreign governments and corporations saying, we'll have the three million in next week, and then can we meet with her the next day?
[00:50:20.523 --> 00:50:21.604]  She's coming to Morocco.
[00:50:21.604 --> 00:50:24.046]  We'll have 12 million wired before she gets here.
[00:50:24.046 --> 00:50:27.310]  And we need her to then bring in sanctions to shut down U.S.
[00:50:27.310 --> 00:50:28.150]  phosphate.
[00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:29.492]  I mean, it's all there.
[00:50:29.492 --> 00:50:32.234]  She shuts down hundreds of millions of phosphate, she gets 12 mil.
[00:50:33.649 --> 00:50:35.910]  Just cut and dry, baby!
[00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:43.313]  Like robbers coming out of the bank with bags of cash in their hands, and the nightly news is there catching them with the police.
[00:50:43.313 --> 00:50:46.315]  She's just got bags of money in her hands, just right there.
[00:50:46.315 --> 00:50:53.338]  Meanwhile, the FBI, the Russians, they've raided a pre-dawn SWAT team raid.
[00:50:53.338 --> 00:50:56.900]  Manafort, the dangerous criminal with no criminal record.
[00:50:56.900 --> 00:50:58.180]  How dare him!
[00:50:58.180 --> 00:50:59.221]  We're gonna get him!
[00:51:02.069 --> 00:51:02.595]  We'll be back.

[00:54:44.993 --> 00:54:53.094]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:54:53.094 --> 00:55:02.936]  Great part right here.
[00:55:02.936 --> 00:55:05.156]  The Blitzkrieg!
[00:55:05.156 --> 00:55:07.517]  Again, I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:55:07.517 --> 00:55:08.457]  Let's get serious here.
[00:55:11.144 --> 00:55:18.671]  I'm obviously very excited, not in a good way, but I can't help the amount of energy I've got today because we are on the edge of nuclear war with China and Russia.
[00:55:18.671 --> 00:55:20.853]  The preparations of this have been decades in the making.
[00:55:20.853 --> 00:55:25.417]  The main trigger, according to all the experts I respect in my own research, is North Korea.
[00:55:25.417 --> 00:55:27.058]  Kim Jong-un is out of his mind.
[00:55:27.058 --> 00:55:30.001]  He's got tens of millions of poor, pathetic slaves under him.
[00:55:30.001 --> 00:55:31.002]  Remember that.
[00:55:31.002 --> 00:55:32.363]  They're a brainwashed cult.
[00:55:32.363 --> 00:55:33.785]  They're not our enemy.
[00:55:33.785 --> 00:55:35.846]  Only maybe one half of one percent
[00:55:36.647 --> 00:55:52.301]  The leadership, and then maybe 5% under them that are the psychotic controllers, and who enjoy the country's main gross domestic product, enslavement, evil, torture, and innocents crying out for God.
[00:55:52.301 --> 00:55:54.463]  Remember, it's anti-Christ, it's anti-Christian.
[00:55:54.463 --> 00:55:55.263]  Remember that!
[00:55:55.263 --> 00:55:56.484]  And the globalists have cheated.
[00:55:56.484 --> 00:56:03.671]  They say, oh, be open to other religions and communism, and then it comes in and it bans Islam, communism, bans everything but itself.
[00:56:05.626 --> 00:56:08.167]  Just like the sanctuary cities, 800 plus.
[00:56:08.167 --> 00:56:16.972]  Nobody else says we have sanctuary cities, but areas of Europe, with the globalists bringing people in to politicize race and then use them as racial voting blocks.
[00:56:16.972 --> 00:56:18.632]  That's cheating!
[00:56:18.632 --> 00:56:28.978]  The Western world, Christians, pass all these laws, open up the borders, bring in all these people, use their labor, their culture, their smarts, a lot of positive things, but then try to turn
[00:56:29.838 --> 00:56:41.246]  America's strength of real diversity against it and create classical racism against white people, which you're then forced to respond to, which becomes classical race battle.
[00:56:41.246 --> 00:56:42.867]  But it is what it is.
[00:56:44.082 --> 00:56:45.083]  It's been manifest.
[00:56:45.083 --> 00:56:45.843]  It's been done.
[00:56:45.843 --> 00:56:46.724]  It's been foisted.
[00:56:46.724 --> 00:56:51.166]  But you've got to understand the North Korea threat's real, but it was created.
[00:56:51.166 --> 00:57:02.754]  You've got to understand all this race baiting coming down against you, if you're Hispanic or white or whatever it is, is real in the person's mind doing it, but is a mirage, but still nevertheless real.
[00:57:04.284 --> 00:57:12.926]  If you're a white guy, because it happens 12 to 1, 15 to 1, most of the cases turn out to be false flags when it is whites reportedly attacking black people.
[00:57:12.926 --> 00:57:13.546]  It's just a fact.
[00:57:13.546 --> 00:57:25.250]  Black folks, a certain percentage of them, a small minority percentage, but still, it's a high number when they attack, are just tracking down whites and shooting them, killing them, beating them, attacking them.
[00:57:25.250 --> 00:57:28.931]  If they have blonde hair and blue eyes, they just attack them and say, you voted for Trump.
[00:57:28.931 --> 00:57:30.451]  The videos are legion.
[00:57:32.870 --> 00:57:34.231]  That's mind control!
[00:57:34.231 --> 00:57:37.352]  That's CNN and the globalists' desperate rearguard action!
[00:57:37.352 --> 00:57:43.455]  It's in the WikiLeaks, using cultural warfare to distract from what they're doing, screwing us all over!
[00:57:43.455 --> 00:57:46.537]  The litmus test!
[00:57:46.537 --> 00:57:50.479]  You see any Hispanic groups telling people, don't take the Gardasil shot?
[00:57:50.479 --> 00:57:53.800]  No.
[00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:57.202]  See, if I didn't like Hispanics, I'd be saying, take your shots!
[00:57:57.202 --> 00:58:00.644]  Because it's known to massively reduce fertility.
[00:58:01.735 --> 00:58:07.017]  And then some people go, well, if the whole world's, you know, gonna be Hispanic here in the United States and they turn them into racist, good, kill them.
[00:58:07.017 --> 00:58:10.778]  They're killing everybody, idiots!
[00:58:10.778 --> 00:58:12.279]  They're coming after everybody!
[00:58:12.279 --> 00:58:14.500]  We have to realize it.
[00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:21.903]  It doesn't mean we don't expose the hypocrisy and all the garbage, but it doesn't mean we're under its control.
[00:58:21.903 --> 00:58:22.223]  Briefly.
[00:58:23.546 --> 00:58:26.589]  Skip breaks, don't even plug, other hosts every minute, just support us.
[00:58:26.589 --> 00:58:28.050]  We need financial support.
[00:58:28.050 --> 00:58:29.571]  We've got great fluoride-free toothpaste.
[00:58:29.571 --> 00:58:31.732]  The kids' version is back in, bubblegum flavor.
[00:58:31.732 --> 00:58:35.855]  We've got great water filtration, great air purifiers, 25% off.
[00:58:35.855 --> 00:58:38.617]  1776 for Brain Force, 1776 for the X2.
[00:58:38.617 --> 00:58:41.059]  We've never had 55% off on those.
[00:58:41.059 --> 00:58:43.821]  And those specials are going to have to end soon because we're getting low on those.
[00:58:43.821 --> 00:58:46.523]  Infowarsstore.com, please support us.
[00:58:46.523 --> 00:58:49.185]  But whatever you do, pray for us.
[00:58:49.185 --> 00:58:51.427]  Pray for America, pray for peace, pray for North Korea.
[00:58:58.091 --> 00:59:08.679]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:59:08.679 --> 00:59:10.740]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:59:10.740 --> 00:59:13.622]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:59:13.622 --> 00:59:15.103]  It's made in the USA.
[00:59:15.103 --> 00:59:18.245]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[00:59:18.465 --> 00:59:21.907]  Absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[00:59:21.907 --> 00:59:24.008]  It is a classical 360 win.
[00:59:24.008 --> 00:59:33.713]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:59:33.713 --> 00:59:46.220]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to
[00:59:46.220 --> 00:59:50.524]  To reignite those rush fires to the next level, and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:59:50.524 --> 00:59:53.828]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[00:59:53.828 --> 00:59:55.410]  Now it's time to change our bodies.
[00:59:55.410 --> 00:59:59.634]  With Z Field and InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:59:59.634 --> 01:00:02.257]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:17.617 --> 01:00:19.458]  North Korea.
[01:00:19.458 --> 01:00:21.138]  China.
[01:00:21.138 --> 01:00:22.379]  Russia.
[01:00:22.379 --> 01:00:30.181]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:30.181 --> 01:00:41.705]  Look at these headlines up on GrudgeReport.com!
[01:00:45.216 --> 01:00:49.517]  Wall Street Journal calls out Bannon for White House dysfunction.
[01:00:49.517 --> 01:00:52.817]  Poisonous atmosphere.
[01:00:52.817 --> 01:01:01.779]  Yes, everybody gangs up on Bannon because they know he helped write the blueprint for the American reboot.
[01:01:01.779 --> 01:01:10.661]  And even the Wall Street Journal, Fox News, more and more, it's getting anti-Trump, going after his allies.
[01:01:12.253 --> 01:01:14.894]  Manafort raided bank records.
[01:01:14.894 --> 01:01:21.257]  We're going to be getting to that with Roger Stone, his former business partner, on the other side.
[01:01:21.257 --> 01:01:24.078]  And he's been subpoenaed for the same non-existent Russia records.
[01:01:24.078 --> 01:01:30.581]  So when you don't send in the non-existent records, it's like, give us your documents, when you were in communication with the Easter Bunny.
[01:01:30.581 --> 01:01:32.522]  And I'm like, I am not in communication with the Easter Bunny.
[01:01:32.522 --> 01:01:38.304]  We're going to have to get a warrant for that then, because we happen to believe you've been talking to a little furry friend.
[01:01:38.304 --> 01:01:39.785]  He's got a cotton tail.
[01:01:41.809 --> 01:01:48.472]  Trump, nuke boast, bombers ready, North Korea no joke, Guam in the crosshairs, world of worry.
[01:01:48.472 --> 01:01:49.412]  Mattis, world?
[01:01:49.412 --> 01:01:57.276]  Needs to understand that this could lead to end of regime.
[01:01:57.276 --> 01:02:10.082]  Oh yeah, understand this, you can't just shoot or cruise missile or particle beam one of their missiles on the tarmac, on the launch pad, on the gantry.
[01:02:12.307 --> 01:02:17.253]  Because North Korea is then going to attack South Korea and Japan and everybody else.
[01:02:17.253 --> 01:02:23.240]  They're completely whacked out of their minds with a crazy obese penguin running them.
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:24.242]  The demonic hedgehog.
[01:02:25.735 --> 01:02:30.058]  If we do have a nuclear war and it ends human life on Earth, I mean, the hedgehog killed us.
[01:02:30.058 --> 01:02:32.620]  It's what Hitler looks like, too, the little pot-bellied guy up there.
[01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:36.003]  But, you know, at least Hitler actually had, like, the Congressional Medal of Honor from the Germans.
[01:02:36.003 --> 01:02:38.705]  He had the Iron Cross First Class.
[01:02:38.705 --> 01:02:43.449]  Kim Jong-un was in a Swiss boarding school until he was 18 years old.
[01:02:43.449 --> 01:02:50.414]  His brother, you know, got caught by his other brother trying to sneak into Disney World in Japan, so he hit him with nerve gas.
[01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:56.861]  Can't make this up.
[01:02:56.861 --> 01:02:59.803]  So we'll play that clip again here right now.
[01:02:59.803 --> 01:03:07.486]  This is Trump talking about fire and fury.
[01:03:07.486 --> 01:03:10.508]  Fire and fury and power.
[01:03:10.508 --> 01:03:19.752]  Which, yes, is what will happen because if he does fire some preemptive strike, which North Korea is saying it's going to do or may do against Guam,
[01:03:20.825 --> 01:03:23.866]  Or against Japan, or against South Korea, or against the U.S.
[01:03:23.866 --> 01:03:24.846]  mainland.
[01:03:24.846 --> 01:03:33.728]  You have to then take out his forces on the DMZ, and only atomic, nuclear, hydrogen weapons, particle weapons are going to do that.
[01:03:33.728 --> 01:03:37.309]  And you've got to get them all!
[01:03:37.309 --> 01:03:42.990]  Let's play a clip from the President, talk about the stuff that Armageddon's made of.
[01:03:42.990 --> 01:03:44.050]  This is really happening.
[01:03:44.050 --> 01:03:44.451]  Here it is.
[01:03:44.451 --> 01:03:50.052]  North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States.
[01:03:51.343 --> 01:03:59.209]  They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.
[01:03:59.209 --> 01:04:05.094]  He has been very threatening beyond a normal state.
[01:04:05.094 --> 01:04:16.183]  And as I said, they will be met with fire, fury, and frankly, power, the likes of which this world has never seen before.
[01:04:16.183 --> 01:04:17.564]  Well, Trump looks pretty
[01:04:20.233 --> 01:04:20.593]  I'll say it.
[01:04:20.593 --> 01:04:21.854]  Pretty evil right there.
[01:04:21.854 --> 01:04:23.055]  Looks pretty scary, doesn't he?
[01:04:23.055 --> 01:04:24.596]  That's the real Donald Trump right there.
[01:04:24.596 --> 01:04:26.858]  Now, I'm not saying evil in a bad way.
[01:04:26.858 --> 01:04:28.179]  He looks scary.
[01:04:28.179 --> 01:04:30.041]  But you're talking about nuclear war.
[01:04:30.041 --> 01:04:31.342]  That is evil.
[01:04:31.342 --> 01:04:33.263]  But if somebody's gonna do it to you, you gotta do it to them.
[01:04:33.263 --> 01:04:35.365]  Which I'm not cheerleading or pushing for.
[01:04:35.365 --> 01:04:36.506]  I have four children.
[01:04:37.714 --> 01:04:41.837]  And believe me, my guts are just... I don't have irrational fears, generally.
[01:04:41.837 --> 01:04:44.139]  I don't have just... Oh, anxiety, because they said so.
[01:04:44.139 --> 01:04:46.101]  My... I think all of us know.
[01:04:46.101 --> 01:04:48.963]  There is like a nasty, dirty, ugh feeling.
[01:04:48.963 --> 01:04:56.529]  You know, like... Just remember the little Easter Bunny that did exist, called Bill Clinton and Hillary, that laid the little eggies over there in North Korea.
[01:04:56.529 --> 01:04:58.190]  The missiles and the nukes.
[01:04:58.190 --> 01:05:00.492]  I was looking at a map, you know?
[01:05:00.492 --> 01:05:03.254]  We've dropped atomic bombs real close to North Korea before.
[01:05:03.254 --> 01:05:03.894]  We have.
[01:05:03.894 --> 01:05:04.375]  Only we.
[01:05:07.588 --> 01:05:18.552]  We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:05:18.552 --> 01:05:25.594]  That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.
[01:05:25.594 --> 01:05:34.737]  That whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government.
[01:05:36.394 --> 01:05:38.175]  Independence isn't a day.
[01:05:38.175 --> 01:05:39.216]  It's a mindset.
[01:05:39.216 --> 01:05:41.998]  An attitude that says, I will not be your dependent.
[01:05:41.998 --> 01:05:43.599]  I will not be your slave.
[01:05:43.599 --> 01:05:49.663]  Dependence and slavery is a chain that is forged link by link with gradual infringements.
[01:05:49.663 --> 01:05:54.626]  When you trade your liberty for safety, to that extent, you become their slave.
[01:05:54.626 --> 01:05:56.528]  Slaves are never safe.
[01:05:56.528 --> 01:05:59.510]  You won't get rich by being a slave.
[01:05:59.510 --> 01:06:00.610]  Guard your liberty.
[01:06:00.610 --> 01:06:03.952]  Regard with suspicion anyone who tries to take it.
[01:06:03.952 --> 01:06:05.854]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[01:06:07.134 --> 01:06:11.797]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[01:06:11.797 --> 01:06:24.743]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[01:06:24.743 --> 01:06:31.307]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[01:06:31.307 --> 01:06:33.788]  And so I set out to develop caveman.
[01:06:33.848 --> 01:06:45.080]  But to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:47.423]  InfoWars isn't just fighting the globalists.
[01:06:47.423 --> 01:06:48.904]  We're getting results.
[01:06:48.904 --> 01:06:54.871]  And we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.
[01:06:55.011 --> 01:06:57.893]  Caveman is finally back at the InfoWars store.
[01:06:57.893 --> 01:07:06.358]  You can get 25% off the regular price for a limited time only at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free, AAA253-3139.
[01:07:06.358 --> 01:07:15.704]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[01:07:15.704 --> 01:07:16.225]  That's right.
[01:07:16.225 --> 01:07:21.188]  Now's the time to build your own food storage with Harvest Rites freeze dryers.
[01:07:21.488 --> 01:07:28.155]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com to learn more and check out this innovative and smart technology that's easy to use.
[01:07:28.155 --> 01:07:35.763]  And let me tell you something, it is perfect for freeze-drying fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy products, desserts, and entire meals.
[01:07:35.763 --> 01:07:36.003]  Woo!
[01:07:36.003 --> 01:07:37.024]  That's what I'm talking about.
[01:07:37.024 --> 01:07:43.731]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store,
[01:07:43.871 --> 01:07:45.753]  There is no comparison.
[01:07:45.753 --> 01:07:55.340]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:58.803]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[01:07:58.803 --> 01:08:02.906]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[01:08:02.906 --> 01:08:03.987]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:08:03.987 --> 01:08:06.549]  Check it out right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:08:16.573 --> 01:08:22.636]  You let one ant stand up to us, then they all might stand up.
[01:08:22.636 --> 01:08:27.638]  Those puny little ants outnumber us a hundred to one.
[01:08:27.638 --> 01:08:32.501]  And if they ever figure that out, there goes our way of life.
[01:08:32.501 --> 01:08:34.482]  It's not about food.
[01:08:34.482 --> 01:08:37.023]  It's about keeping those ants in line.
[01:08:43.743 --> 01:08:45.884]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:45.884 --> 01:08:56.351]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[01:08:56.351 --> 01:08:57.291]  This is really happening.
[01:08:57.291 --> 01:09:08.979]  This is President Trump last night responding after Kim Jong-un, the hereditary dictator of North Korea, given nuclear weapons by the Clintons, threatened to preemptively nuke the United States again.
[01:09:08.979 --> 01:09:09.299]  Here it is.
[01:09:10.094 --> 01:09:16.119]  Korea best not make any more threats to the United States.
[01:09:16.119 --> 01:09:23.985]  They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.
[01:09:23.985 --> 01:09:29.889]  He has been very threatening beyond a normal state.
[01:09:29.889 --> 01:09:39.617]  And as I said, they will be met with fire, fury, and frankly, power, the likes of which this world has never seen before.
[01:09:41.414 --> 01:09:49.776]  Corporate fake press has Merkel running around and others trying to act like Trump is escalating things and that Trump is bad.
[01:09:49.776 --> 01:09:52.977]  Trump didn't give the fissile material, the reactors, to North Korea.
[01:09:52.977 --> 01:09:57.958]  The Clintons did, with a bipartisan group out of the U.S.
[01:09:57.958 --> 01:09:59.399]  Trump didn't give them the missile secrets.
[01:09:59.399 --> 01:10:02.159]  The globalists did.
[01:10:02.159 --> 01:10:07.501]  Trump didn't give the Russians atomic weapons in the late 40s.
[01:10:07.501 --> 01:10:08.801]  Leftists in our government did.
[01:10:10.151 --> 01:10:34.052]  The scourge of the planet, leftist, collectivist, and now we have seen the armistice, the ceasefire since 1953, July 27th, and here we are, looking at Kim Jong-un threatening to strike Guam with medium-range missiles, with nuclear weapons, threatening to attack the U.S., and now he's got missiles and warheads that can hit us, according to Pentagon reports.
[01:10:34.052 --> 01:10:36.394]  The question is, would they re-enter properly?
[01:10:36.394 --> 01:10:37.095]  Would they deploy?
[01:10:42.093 --> 01:10:43.213]  This is a big deal.
[01:10:43.213 --> 01:10:44.173]  Now it's multifaceted.
[01:10:44.173 --> 01:10:51.895]  You've got McMaster that's kind of been pushing for preemptive strikes and saying that, which then gives North Korea the excuse to escalate.
[01:10:51.895 --> 01:10:57.796]  McMaster wants that as a political distraction from the things he's doing.
[01:10:57.796 --> 01:11:06.118]  And you've also got a lot of deep state actors that are in communication with North Korea that are empowering Kim Jong-un.
[01:11:07.578 --> 01:11:15.682]  To believe that he can intimidate Trump and embarrass him, and he's being goaded from my sources into this.
[01:11:15.682 --> 01:11:29.670]  Now it may be a quadruple, double-cross game, but we know the Jimmy Carters, the Bill Clintons, the Hillary Clintons, the globalists of the world are in constant communication with his top generals and with the North Korean dictator.
[01:11:29.670 --> 01:11:31.131]  More so, maybe even than China.
[01:11:34.155 --> 01:11:43.317]  North Korea was left there as a strategic detonator used by all sides as the crisis between India and China escalates and as they openly threaten war with each other.
[01:11:43.317 --> 01:11:47.138]  But at Infowars.com is the headline.
[01:11:47.138 --> 01:11:54.260]  Two of Britain's biggest newspapers tell the public to prepare for nuclear war and to find their local fallout shelter.
[01:11:54.260 --> 01:11:56.980]  I'm not saying I think this is going to happen.
[01:11:56.980 --> 01:11:57.901]  I have four children.
[01:11:57.901 --> 01:11:59.581]  I don't want war with North Korea.
[01:11:59.581 --> 01:12:02.922]  But if he preemptively fires weapons and attacks somebody,
[01:12:04.124 --> 01:12:06.846]  He has to be decapitated quickly.
[01:12:06.846 --> 01:12:13.552]  And Russia and China have to be told in no uncertain terms, do not get involved in this when we do this.
[01:12:13.552 --> 01:12:17.375]  And they've been signaling they're going to stand down, but don't want it to happen.
[01:12:17.375 --> 01:12:18.616]  I don't want it to happen either.
[01:12:18.616 --> 01:12:27.364]  But if we go to war, it's got to be regime change, and it's got to be devastating, and ladies and gentlemen, we can't conventionally take on North Korea.
[01:12:27.364 --> 01:12:29.746]  They've got a million plus man brainwashed army.
[01:12:31.109 --> 01:12:34.091]  I'd say it's 20 times worse than Iraq.
[01:12:34.091 --> 01:12:35.292]  Cult-like following.
[01:12:35.292 --> 01:12:40.196]  They will attack 100,000 pieces of artillery, Katyusha rockets, the whole nine yards.
[01:12:40.196 --> 01:12:42.759]  You're going to have to hit them with nuclear weapons.
[01:12:42.759 --> 01:12:45.000]  And I've talked to a bunch of experts, they agree.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:51.406]  They're going to have to hit the entire DMZ with not just conventional, but high-powered atomic weapons.
[01:12:51.406 --> 01:12:53.387]  Hydrogen bombs, you name it.
[01:12:53.387 --> 01:12:57.731]  They can roll out the radiation weapons, directed energy weapons.
[01:12:57.731 --> 01:12:59.652]  They've got high-powered ones that'll kill whole cities.
[01:13:00.513 --> 01:13:07.359]  And I'm sad for the slaves in North Korea, but if that's what's going to happen, we're still at war with North Korea.
[01:13:07.359 --> 01:13:11.603]  So coming up at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to walk through all of this, the latest.
[01:13:11.603 --> 01:13:12.664]  Now's the time to be praying.
[01:13:15.134 --> 01:13:17.435]  Now's the time to be praying because Deep State is manipulating us.
[01:13:17.435 --> 01:13:19.136]  Steve Pchenik's been to North Korea many times.
[01:13:19.136 --> 01:13:25.198]  He's been involved as one of the undersecretaries of state in Asia with the State Department and the CIA, obviously.
[01:13:25.198 --> 01:13:26.399]  And he's going to come on.
[01:13:26.399 --> 01:13:28.620]  He knows some of the top generals over there.
[01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:32.521]  He was just in North Korea a few years ago.
[01:13:32.521 --> 01:13:34.542]  And we'll see what he has to say.
[01:13:34.542 --> 01:13:38.964]  We're going to get Joel Skousen of World Affairs Brief on.
[01:13:38.964 --> 01:13:42.706]  We're going to talk about it all, but joining us now
[01:13:43.899 --> 01:13:48.743]  from DC is Roger Stone.
[01:13:48.743 --> 01:13:56.229]  We have seen his former business partner Manafort, who was the head of the Trump campaign, raided.
[01:13:56.229 --> 01:14:01.714]  Roger was the former first campaign head of the 2016 Trump election campaign.
[01:14:01.714 --> 01:14:06.077]  FBI conducted pre-dawn raid of former Trump campaign chairman Manafort's home.
[01:14:06.077 --> 01:14:11.502]  And what's amazing is the Washington Post admits he'd already turned over these very documents.
[01:14:12.418 --> 01:14:16.401]  So this is done, in my view, I haven't talked to Roger yet, for optics.
[01:14:16.401 --> 01:14:19.463]  Of, oh look, a grand jury indictment coming.
[01:14:19.463 --> 01:14:20.864]  Oh, see, they're criminals.
[01:14:20.864 --> 01:14:22.125]  Oh, raids.
[01:14:22.125 --> 01:14:23.386]  It's all done.
[01:14:23.386 --> 01:14:25.227]  SWAT team raids in the early morning.
[01:14:25.227 --> 01:14:28.950]  So you must have, it's come from a raid Amish for giving their neighbors cheese.
[01:14:28.950 --> 01:14:33.973]  They have a SWAT team and shove the old Amish man down on the ground when he didn't have a criminal record.
[01:14:33.973 --> 01:14:35.895]  His daddy's daddy didn't have one.
[01:14:35.895 --> 01:14:37.196]  Nobody's got a criminal record.
[01:14:37.816 --> 01:14:49.188]  But we're just going to shove you down in the mud on camera from the jury, because the jury thinks, well, the FBI, the authority figure, shoved the Amish man down for giving his neighbor cheese that was an FBI informant.
[01:14:49.188 --> 01:14:50.970]  That's a real case.
[01:14:50.970 --> 01:14:57.818]  Manafort has voluntarily produced documents, the Congressional Committee's investigating Russia interference, the 2016 presidential election, the search warrant.
[01:14:59.215 --> 01:15:08.623]  Indicates investigators may have argued to a federal judge that they had reasonably been afford could not be trusted to turn over all the records in response to a grand jury subpoena.
[01:15:08.623 --> 01:15:11.205]  But what if, what if there are no documents?
[01:15:11.205 --> 01:15:15.569]  And that's why they had to do the raid for optics and they admit they've run into a brick wall.
[01:15:15.569 --> 01:15:17.651]  Now they're saying it's criminal!
[01:15:17.651 --> 01:15:20.373]  Was there any checks or did he lie on IRS forms?
[01:15:20.373 --> 01:15:24.457]  It's now a giant dragnet run out of the District of Columbia.
[01:15:25.669 --> 01:15:31.600]  The swamp has given birth to a grand jury with subpoenas going up!
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:33.504]  I'm told that I may be subpoenaed.
[01:15:33.504 --> 01:15:38.012]  I know the Federal Elections Commission wants me subpoenaed for my Russian funding!
[01:15:40.626 --> 01:15:44.529]  They're saying you buying our products are Russians!
[01:15:44.529 --> 01:15:46.010]  They think you're morons!
[01:15:46.010 --> 01:15:48.092]  They're coming after the press, they're bullies!
[01:15:48.092 --> 01:15:56.018]  And I'm proud to stand in the second American Revolution against globalists that are a thousand times worse than King George III, and we're winning!
[01:15:56.018 --> 01:15:57.619]  This is because they're failing!
[01:15:57.619 --> 01:16:06.687]  The stock market's up, our military's being rebuilt, our veterans are starting to get taken care of, our borders are getting secured, Christianity's being defended again, they don't know what to do!
[01:16:09.099 --> 01:16:14.363]  InfoWars contributor Roger Stone launching his own syndicated program coming up in early September.
[01:16:14.363 --> 01:16:20.188]  The War Room with Roger Stone, Mike Cernovich, and our own Owen Schroyer.
[01:16:20.188 --> 01:16:21.449]  You've heard my breakdown.
[01:16:21.449 --> 01:16:22.129]  Is it accurate?
[01:16:22.129 --> 01:16:23.611]  And give us your latest intel.
[01:16:23.611 --> 01:16:25.212]  Have you talked to Mana Ford?
[01:16:25.212 --> 01:16:26.773]  This was kept under wraps for a few weeks.
[01:16:26.773 --> 01:16:32.598]  Is it being brought out now to smoke screen for the fact that we have a Soros known operative now and General McMaster?
[01:16:34.656 --> 01:16:39.279]  Well, Alex, your report is essentially correct.
[01:16:39.279 --> 01:16:58.089]  Jack Boone and Thugs, authorized by Robert Mueller, kicked down the front door of Manafort Home, proceeded to the bedroom, kicked down the door to the marital bedroom, seeking documents that they had never requested.
[01:16:58.089 --> 01:17:03.592]  Mundane bank statements and documents that would certainly have been turned over.
[01:17:05.058 --> 01:17:14.408]  Mr. Mueller is extremely well acquainted with the law firm that represents Manafort, but no request was registered.
[01:17:14.408 --> 01:17:17.411]  The reason for this raid is to distract from the fact
[01:17:18.311 --> 01:17:34.285]  That prosecutors in the Southern District of New York are now questioning close associates of Hillary Clinton and are seeking an interview with Hillary and her husband regarding the activities of the Clinton Foundation.
[01:17:34.285 --> 01:17:37.628]  Evidently, Jeff Sessions suddenly woke up.
[01:17:37.628 --> 01:17:39.970]  Somebody woke him up.
[01:17:39.970 --> 01:17:44.274]  And therefore, I think the Manafort raid is made to distract from the fact
[01:17:45.129 --> 01:17:50.053]  That justice may be about to catch up with the Clintons.
[01:17:50.053 --> 01:17:58.480]  There is nothing I am told in the records that were seized that is anything beyond the mundane.
[01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:08.349]  This is part and parcel of the Mueller effort to frame Donald Trump or his associates based on constructing a case.
[01:18:09.113 --> 01:18:19.482]  Which the Democrats, should they grab control of the House in 2018, would use as a phony basis for impeachment.
[01:18:19.482 --> 01:18:24.446]  That's the game that is afoot.
[01:18:24.446 --> 01:18:27.168]  Expanding on that, is that breaking news?
[01:18:27.168 --> 01:18:30.391]  Dealing with Sessions beginning to go after Hillary herself?
[01:18:31.985 --> 01:18:39.466]  It has been intimated on the net, but I have now confirmed from law enforcement sources in New York.
[01:18:40.548 --> 01:18:48.190]  That there is definite movement and I will have more to report at 2 p.m.
[01:18:48.190 --> 01:18:50.611]  Central Time today on InfoWars.
[01:18:50.611 --> 01:19:06.396]  I'm still gathering data on this and the latest on McMaster's coordination with George Soros and the Soros mole in the Trump White House of Fiona Hill.
[01:19:06.396 --> 01:19:09.657]  More on all of that later today on InfoWars.
[01:19:12.182 --> 01:19:27.270]  Roger, this is like an action-adventure movie we're now living in, with North Korea and the Clintons arming them, and now the Clintons still somewhat in power through this corrupt shadow state, battling the American people and President Trump.
[01:19:27.270 --> 01:19:30.212]  And the people, it seems though, are seeing right through this.
[01:19:30.212 --> 01:19:36.495]  They're running all these new hoaxes that he's down in the polls, which our research shows isn't true.
[01:19:36.495 --> 01:19:38.737]  They're starting to abandon a lot of the Russian narrative, though.
[01:19:39.730 --> 01:19:45.455]  And are moving, as you predicted six months ago, to just general obstruction of anything.
[01:19:45.455 --> 01:19:52.401]  Crimes, bounce checks, anybody in the government, you know, having a government employee shine their shoes.
[01:19:52.401 --> 01:19:57.045]  I mean, just like with Netanyahu's wife for cell phone bills or whatever.
[01:19:57.045 --> 01:20:06.313]  It's now taking on classic dragnet, complete witch hunt, run by people that Trump has fired that are on Mueller's staff.
[01:20:08.567 --> 01:20:10.248]  Well, I think you're exactly right, Alex.
[01:20:10.248 --> 01:20:14.291]  The problem, fundamentally, is that the Obamas still run the U.S.
[01:20:14.291 --> 01:20:15.932]  Justice Department.
[01:20:15.932 --> 01:20:29.060]  In the recent trial of Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, a key endorser of Donald Trump, the Justice Department monitored his communications with his attorneys during the trial.
[01:20:30.171 --> 01:20:35.414]  They communicated improperly with the judge during the trial.
[01:20:35.414 --> 01:20:49.382]  And all of this, of course, is payback for Sheriff Joe's support of Donald Trump and his claims that Barack Obama was not born in the United States, which he has sought to pursue.
[01:20:49.382 --> 01:20:54.325]  You would think that the Trump Justice Department would dismiss this case
[01:20:55.083 --> 01:21:03.605]  But there is no one who works for Trump working at justice other than Jeff Sessions, who very sadly appears to be asleep.
[01:21:03.605 --> 01:21:06.265]  I think he's asleep, actually.
[01:21:06.265 --> 01:21:21.268]  Instead of pursuing the Clintons, who certainly deserve to go to jail, we have the entire front line of the NSA under Barack Obama wiretapping and surveilling at least 30,000 people.
[01:21:23.061 --> 01:21:35.469]  Brennan knew, Rogers knew, Valerie Jarrett knew, Susan Rice knew, Ben Rhodes knew, but there's no one kicking in their doors at five o'clock in the morning and arresting them.
[01:21:36.092 --> 01:21:38.513]  Barack Obama is running the U.S.
[01:21:38.513 --> 01:21:42.954]  Justice Department under the Trump presidency.
[01:21:42.954 --> 01:21:45.475]  It's extraordinary and frankly quite sad.
[01:21:45.475 --> 01:21:51.257]  And he's moved in down the block in a lavish armored compound with walls to run the operation.
[01:21:51.257 --> 01:21:57.720]  Before he left office when President Trump was President-elect, Obama bragged and his servants bragged, we're digging in.
[01:21:58.340 --> 01:22:00.741]  We're even putting more people in positions.
[01:22:00.741 --> 01:22:07.002]  We're even finding people that don't have a social history online that are our operatives, and they even put spies in.
[01:22:07.002 --> 01:22:16.764]  And as you said, even the New York Times now admits that they're out going to government employees to recruit them as moles.
[01:22:16.764 --> 01:22:19.024]  Some word is money's being paid.
[01:22:19.024 --> 01:22:22.125]  This is an espionage operation against our own
[01:22:23.831 --> 01:22:28.353]  Well, I think there's every possible effort being made to silence anyone who would expose what's going on.
[01:22:28.353 --> 01:22:31.535]  This lawsuit that Obama and his allies filed against me.
[01:22:54.082 --> 01:22:57.387]  is a is a an outrageous abusive process.
[01:22:57.387 --> 01:22:59.630]  It's a tissue of lies.
[01:22:59.630 --> 01:23:07.280]  And I would be unconcerned about it except for it's going to be heard in the District of Columbia where the chances of my getting
[01:23:08.167 --> 01:23:12.271]  A fair judge or a reasonable jury are non-existent.
[01:23:12.271 --> 01:23:13.071]  It's harassment.
[01:23:13.071 --> 01:23:26.762]  You see, Alex, if they can distract me and tie me up fighting this phony lawsuit, that's time and effort I can't spend trying to save the president from the cabal of globalists who have settled in around him.
[01:23:26.762 --> 01:23:30.365]  So I really think that's the goal.
[01:23:30.365 --> 01:23:33.768]  We are in for some very tough weeks ahead.
[01:23:34.446 --> 01:23:37.727]  Mueller has no concern for the law or the facts.
[01:23:37.727 --> 01:23:40.588]  He is hell-bent on taking down the president.
[01:23:40.588 --> 01:23:50.851]  And sadly, General Kelly, General McMaster, and perhaps General Mattis are prepared to sit back and let that happen.
[01:23:50.851 --> 01:24:00.334]  Roger, clearly if they're able to remove Trump, which I don't think they're gonna be able to do if we stay on air and stay focused, they're gonna go after everybody else.
[01:24:00.334 --> 01:24:03.315]  They're gonna try to show up the political system because they know they've lost
[01:24:04.930 --> 01:24:08.872]  The people entirely, the public knows that they've broken the social contract.
[01:24:08.872 --> 01:24:15.336]  And I like the fact that the president's really gotten tough on Sessions and they've reconciled now and that we're seeing some movement from him.
[01:24:15.336 --> 01:24:17.517]  But I agree with Congressman Chaffetz and others.
[01:24:18.775 --> 01:24:22.118]  I don't want press conferences, I want indictments.
[01:24:22.118 --> 01:24:36.190]  I mean, you've got Obama and his people on the news when President Trump was President-elect saying, we're going to sabotage, we're going to block, we're going to stop him, we've been spying on him, we're giving all the info to the media.
[01:24:36.650 --> 01:24:38.812]  And then Trump gets into office and goes, that's illegal.
[01:24:38.812 --> 01:24:40.174]  And they go, we never said that.
[01:24:40.174 --> 01:24:43.457]  And we've got hundreds of articles and statements where they said they did it.
[01:24:43.457 --> 01:24:45.679]  It's open and shut indictments.
[01:24:45.679 --> 01:24:47.721]  We think of espionage by some foreign power.
[01:24:47.721 --> 01:24:53.887]  This is the most common form of espionage is a coup, like we see in Latin America or Asia or Europe.
[01:24:53.887 --> 01:24:57.170]  Here, our coups are just more silent because we don't do that in the West.
[01:24:57.170 --> 01:24:59.413]  And it's a classic coup by deep state.
[01:25:00.677 --> 01:25:14.060]  With comedy shows acting as news bullhorns, out there cheerleading, and even targeting you and myself for destruction, cutting off our sponsors, trying to put us in prison, I would expect that...
[01:25:14.878 --> 01:25:16.138]  You've talked about this.
[01:25:16.138 --> 01:25:17.499]  I would expect a SWAT team raid.
[01:25:17.499 --> 01:25:20.500]  I would expect you to get one because that's what they do.
[01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:21.560]  We've sat around.
[01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:24.741]  We went out on my ski boat a few weeks ago and we had the discussion over a beer.
[01:25:24.741 --> 01:25:35.265]  We said, I wonder when we get the SWAT team raid because we know that then escalates into them killing us because first they want to demonize you as a criminal and then have somebody kill you.
[01:25:36.205 --> 01:25:41.647]  Car wreck, carjacking, whatever it is, or you're found dead with a hooker and, you know, heroin.
[01:25:41.647 --> 01:25:43.328]  This is the kind of crap they do.
[01:25:43.328 --> 01:25:45.809]  Assassinate your character ahead of actually killing you.
[01:25:45.809 --> 01:25:48.550]  So I just want everybody to know, I'm not a loser if they kill me.
[01:25:48.550 --> 01:25:49.250]  I'm a winner.
[01:25:49.250 --> 01:25:50.410]  We change the world.
[01:25:50.410 --> 01:25:53.171]  And don't take my death as a loss.
[01:25:53.171 --> 01:25:54.212]  Take it as a martyr.
[01:25:54.212 --> 01:25:55.432]  Move forward.
[01:25:55.432 --> 01:25:56.813]  We are going to defeat these people.
[01:25:56.813 --> 01:25:58.093]  We are the winners.
[01:25:58.093 --> 01:25:59.073]  We are the free market.
[01:25:59.073 --> 01:26:00.194]  We are the Americans.
[01:26:00.194 --> 01:26:01.134]  We are the patriots.
[01:26:01.134 --> 01:26:02.254]  We are the underdogs.
[01:26:02.254 --> 01:26:02.995]  And we are winning.
[01:26:02.995 --> 01:26:03.475]  Roger Stone.
[01:26:04.537 --> 01:26:29.291]  You know, Alex, I say again, the key to the president's survival is the FISA court declaration at the end of the Obama administration, which indisputably proves that Obama's NSA was illegally surveilling up to 30,000 Americans, which include Roger Stone, Paul Manafort, Donald Trump, and in my opinion, Alex Jones.
[01:26:32.253 --> 01:26:41.758]  General McMaster and General Kelly have worked very hard to keep the very existence of that report away from the President.
[01:26:41.758 --> 01:26:47.681]  Because were he to order the prosecutions, his tormentors are defeated.
[01:26:47.681 --> 01:26:52.183]  Obama will have a hard time running the anti-Trump campaign from a prison cell.
[01:26:52.967 --> 01:27:02.012]  Instead, unfortunately, Attorney General Sessions is too busy chasing marijuana smokers and now chasing the Clintons.
[01:27:02.012 --> 01:27:07.435]  While I appreciate the sentiment, the Clintons are no longer running the Democratic Party.
[01:27:07.435 --> 01:27:09.397]  This is an Obama operation.
[01:27:09.397 --> 01:27:12.698]  The Clintons are a vague embarrassment to the Democrats.
[01:27:12.698 --> 01:27:17.061]  Yes, they should go to jail for their crimes, but there's plenty of time for that.
[01:27:17.061 --> 01:27:20.303]  Right now, they have to gut the centerpiece
[01:27:20.953 --> 01:27:27.537]  Talking to patriots in Florida, they are planning to march on Mar-a-Lago the first time the President goes there to demand the firing of McMaster.
[01:27:51.013 --> 01:27:53.275]  They will line the motorcade route.
[01:27:53.275 --> 01:27:59.239]  They will make it very clear to the President that he is being misled, he is being lied to.
[01:27:59.239 --> 01:28:01.881]  McMaster works for Soros.
[01:28:01.881 --> 01:28:04.803]  McMaster reports to Soros.
[01:28:04.803 --> 01:28:14.490]  McMaster has inserted a Soros goon, Fiona Hill, and a fellow traveler neocon named Allison Nielsen.
[01:28:15.299 --> 01:28:23.010]  McMaster does not support the Trump agenda, but these things are being kept from the president.
[01:28:23.010 --> 01:28:29.160]  The president is unaware that General McMaster gave Susan Rice a pass
[01:28:30.429 --> 01:28:32.610]  On her political espionage.
[01:28:32.610 --> 01:28:40.772]  The president is unaware that he extended Susan Rice's national security clearance.
[01:28:40.772 --> 01:28:55.796]  The president is unaware that Samantha Powers, the UN ambassador, was unmasking hundreds of Republicans and engaging in political espionage in violation of the Constitution and the law.
[01:28:55.796 --> 01:28:59.317]  General Kelly has successfully kept that information
[01:29:00.020 --> 01:29:01.641]  From the President.
[01:29:01.641 --> 01:29:08.407]  Now, it's heartening to watch Sean Hannity, who finally figured out who the Deep State is.
[01:29:08.407 --> 01:29:14.292]  He's clearly been watching you and I on InfoWars because he's now repeating our schtick.
[01:29:14.292 --> 01:29:14.632]  Sean!
[01:29:15.191 --> 01:29:16.352]  Get your own script.
[01:29:16.352 --> 01:29:21.577]  Your heart's in the right place, but you don't need to keep repeating at night what we report on InfoWallet.
[01:29:35.850 --> 01:29:37.591]  I'm glad that they've looked into our research.
[01:29:37.591 --> 01:29:41.093]  The Washington Post has demonized him, saying, you know, he's becoming Alex Jones.
[01:29:41.093 --> 01:29:44.014]  That's... That's good!
[01:29:44.014 --> 01:29:46.515]  I know, I know that you and him had a beef behind the scenes.
[01:29:46.515 --> 01:29:47.675]  He should have you on.
[01:29:47.675 --> 01:29:48.976]  They'd probably fire him.
[01:29:48.976 --> 01:29:49.776]  Come on.
[01:29:49.776 --> 01:29:50.417]  Come on.
[01:29:50.417 --> 01:29:53.178]  We'll be right back with a few more comments from Roger that I meant in the North Korea News.
[01:29:53.178 --> 01:29:55.719]  I'm taking your calls.
[01:29:55.719 --> 01:29:57.100]  We're on the march.
[01:29:57.100 --> 01:29:59.641]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:59.641 --> 01:30:02.322]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:07.972 --> 01:30:13.215]  Protect your skin with SPF 30 sunscreen lotion by Emrix Essentials.
[01:30:13.215 --> 01:30:20.380]  Perfect for face and body, this natural unscented sunscreen can be worn at all times of the day, whenever you need sun protection.
[01:30:20.380 --> 01:30:26.263]  We source ingredients from nature, producing a product free of harmful chemicals and toxins.
[01:30:26.263 --> 01:30:34.088]  This natural lotion contains 21% zinc oxide, which is the largest particle size used, and we do not use nanoparticles.
[01:30:34.588 --> 01:30:38.111]  The larger the particle, the safer it is for your body.
[01:30:38.111 --> 01:30:42.233]  The organic oils help hydrate the skin, leaving it nice and smooth.
[01:30:42.233 --> 01:30:46.676]  The truly natural fragrance-free sunscreen for the most sensitive skin.
[01:30:46.676 --> 01:30:52.881]  Emerix Essentials wants you to enjoy the sun and strives to bring you organic products to enhance your life.
[01:30:52.881 --> 01:30:57.764]  Naturally protect your skin with SPF 30 sunscreen lotion by Emerix Essentials.
[01:30:58.024 --> 01:31:01.307]  Stop exposing yourself and your family to toxic ingredients.
[01:31:01.307 --> 01:31:06.591]  Visit InfoWarsStore.com and learn more about the new SPF30 sunscreen lotion.
[01:31:07.156 --> 01:31:12.539]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:31:12.539 --> 01:31:15.401]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[01:31:15.401 --> 01:31:17.382]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[01:31:17.382 --> 01:31:22.404]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[01:31:22.404 --> 01:31:24.506]  Research across the board is clear.
[01:31:24.506 --> 01:31:25.786]  In fact, it's certified.
[01:31:25.786 --> 01:31:30.909]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[01:31:30.909 --> 01:31:34.271]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns
[01:31:34.411 --> 01:31:37.772]  That your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[01:31:37.772 --> 01:31:40.773]  Super Blue Fluoride-Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[01:31:40.773 --> 01:31:44.454]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[01:31:44.454 --> 01:31:51.376]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[01:31:51.376 --> 01:31:58.878]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more.
[01:31:58.878 --> 01:32:01.819]  Learn more about InfoWars Life Super Blue Toothpaste.
[01:32:02.039 --> 01:32:07.860]  At Infowarslife.com and support the InfoWar while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[01:32:07.860 --> 01:32:15.402]  The rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[01:32:15.402 --> 01:32:23.744]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:32:23.744 --> 01:32:29.405]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:32:29.585 --> 01:32:31.386]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:32:31.386 --> 01:32:33.548]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:32:33.548 --> 01:32:38.011]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:32:38.011 --> 01:32:40.213]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:32:40.213 --> 01:32:47.939]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[01:32:48.339 --> 01:32:51.581]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:19.455 --> 01:33:22.877]  I'm just an average man with an average life.
[01:33:22.877 --> 01:33:23.717]  I work from 9 to 5.
[01:33:23.717 --> 01:33:25.898]  Hey, hell, I pay the price.
[01:33:25.898 --> 01:33:30.541]  All I want is to be left alone in my average home.
[01:33:30.541 --> 01:33:34.062]  But why do I always feel like I'm in the twilight zone?
[01:33:34.062 --> 01:33:39.365]  And I always feel like somebody's watching me.
[01:33:39.365 --> 01:33:41.026]  And I have no privacy.
[01:33:41.026 --> 01:33:41.806]  Oh, oh.
[01:33:41.806 --> 01:33:45.368]  I always feel like somebody's watching me.
[01:33:58.146 --> 01:34:12.272]  By the way, I've gotten so tunnel vision on North Korea and on the Manafort FBI raid and all the insanity going on
[01:34:25.572 --> 01:34:28.033]  That I haven't even told you about some of the guests today.
[01:34:28.033 --> 01:34:31.154]  Adam Curry, the most famous DJ ever.
[01:34:31.154 --> 01:34:35.036]  I mean, you know it's true, you know it's true.
[01:34:35.036 --> 01:34:42.239]  And of course, we've got Steve Pchenik, who was the Undersecretary of State Department for Asia.
[01:34:43.826 --> 01:34:51.537]  He will be joining us to get into North Korea, a place he's visited quite a bit, including recently, and that whole crisis.
[01:34:51.537 --> 01:35:00.028]  And then, of course, Roger Stone's hosting the 4th Hour, but he's going to get it spankin', because he works with InfoWars now officially, and he doesn't have his external mic.
[01:35:00.589 --> 01:35:04.733]  He's going to be hosting it from a hotel room, which is okay, but we're on all these radio stations.
[01:35:04.733 --> 01:35:11.139]  I've begged him privately, so now, not just woodshed about not worshipping Hannity properly, I'm joking, but now this.
[01:35:11.139 --> 01:35:20.649]  Seriously though, gallows humor, Adam Curry is with us, 30 minutes to the next hour, then Steve Pichinik, and I'm going to open the phones up for the first 30 minutes of the next hour to talk about North Korea.
[01:35:21.169 --> 01:35:24.412]  They're saying this is the closest to midnight we've ever been with nuclear war.
[01:35:24.412 --> 01:35:27.255]  I'm really concerned about it.
[01:35:27.255 --> 01:35:30.137]  Adam, you were pretty excited when you walked in here and saw Roger Stone up there.
[01:35:30.137 --> 01:35:30.597]  Of course!
[01:35:30.597 --> 01:35:32.619]  Is he not a living character?
[01:35:32.619 --> 01:35:35.202]  He is a legend, and he's really big here on the screen in front of me.
[01:35:35.202 --> 01:35:36.703]  Roger, how are you doing?
[01:35:36.703 --> 01:35:37.504]  I'm excellent.
[01:35:37.504 --> 01:35:43.969]  You know, Alex, I don't have an external mic, but as the Chinese say, one picture worth a thousand words.
[01:35:43.969 --> 01:35:45.431]  That's the Chinese, huh?
[01:35:53.833 --> 01:36:01.401]  Well, we finally have a president who doesn't draw a line in the sand and then sit back helplessly while our adversaries cross it.
[01:36:02.536 --> 01:36:06.298]  I think the boy dictator has picked a fight with the wrong guy.
[01:36:06.298 --> 01:36:10.881]  Maybe he was used to Obama, you know, rolling over on everything.
[01:36:10.881 --> 01:36:12.342]  Trump will not roll over.
[01:36:12.342 --> 01:36:21.287]  He will do what is necessary to preserve world peace and to stop these maniacs from incinerating the globe.
[01:36:21.287 --> 01:36:23.848]  And should the president
[01:36:25.405 --> 01:36:37.168]  Continue to make serious progress on improving the economy and demonstrate his commitment to a tougher-minded foreign policy, he will get re-elected.
[01:36:37.168 --> 01:36:48.970]  Terrific column by former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown last week saying to his fellow Democrats, wake up you idiots, he's on his way to re-election.
[01:36:50.120 --> 01:37:13.397]  Roger, other TedBets, I mean clearly, how would you define this massive escalation as just that, with this optics raid for bank documents that Manafort had agreed if they wanted to turn over, and of course the FBI has digital records going back decades, under Know Your Customer, they're in all the bank records, this is just ridiculous, purely optics, and I don't see the American people buying into it, what do you think?
[01:37:14.643 --> 01:37:20.346]  Alex, it's harassment, just like the lawsuit I referred to earlier that they filed against me.
[01:37:20.346 --> 01:37:23.968]  This is all meant to be harassment.
[01:37:23.968 --> 01:37:34.254]  No one has yet proven a scintilla of evidence that Manafort colluded in any way with the Russians or that anyone else in the Trump campaign did.
[01:37:34.854 --> 01:37:44.022]  But they need to distract from the fact that they were involved in wholesale political espionage in violation of the Constitution and the law.
[01:37:44.022 --> 01:37:59.936]  They need to distract from their ongoing crimes, the outrageousness of the prosecution of Joe Arpaio, the ongoing secret grand jury seeking an indictment against Julian Assange, the journalist who runs
[01:38:00.436 --> 01:38:02.918]  And by the way, you mentioned this earlier, but what's the word?
[01:38:02.918 --> 01:38:08.743]  I remember from other sources, when they said it publicly, they're floating my name around too, in the magic indictment, Hopper.
[01:38:08.743 --> 01:38:11.486]  I mean, are they going to indict me as being a Russkie?
[01:38:11.486 --> 01:38:18.972]  We had a meeting last night of the 45 group, which is a secret group of Trump loyalists.
[01:38:18.972 --> 01:38:23.296]  We have pledged to do whatever is necessary to avert this coup.
[01:38:24.496 --> 01:38:34.063]  And there is some discussion that you are on a hit list for government raid, for harassment.
[01:38:34.063 --> 01:38:35.464]  I'm on the list.
[01:38:35.464 --> 01:38:38.887]  There are several others that are mutual friends of ours.
[01:38:38.887 --> 01:38:40.728]  So you're in good company.
[01:38:40.728 --> 01:38:44.211]  But yes, I think that Alex, you've been targeted.
[01:38:45.655 --> 01:38:55.179]  Because you're the tip of the spear, because you are riling people to stand up against the machine, and they would love to silence you.
[01:38:55.179 --> 01:39:03.223]  One way, as you know, that they're seeking to do this is through their manipulation of the internet, the manipulation of the algorithms.
[01:39:04.844 --> 01:39:17.234]  Oh yeah, they've gone from denying that, I don't know about with Adam Curry, to just exploding because it's just really intensifying right now and it shows they know they have nothing left but to try to shut us up.
[01:39:17.234 --> 01:39:18.495]  You had the right idea.
[01:39:18.495 --> 01:39:21.037]  When did you start calling things InfoWars?
[01:39:21.037 --> 01:39:21.537]  20 years ago?
[01:39:21.537 --> 01:39:22.478]  25 years ago?
[01:39:22.478 --> 01:39:23.119]  About 20 years ago.
[01:39:23.119 --> 01:39:23.839]  You had the right idea.
[01:39:23.839 --> 01:39:25.741]  That is exactly what we're in right now.
[01:39:25.741 --> 01:39:26.562]  Information Wars.
[01:39:27.262 --> 01:39:30.327]  And not so much mainstream media, but the algorithms.
[01:39:30.327 --> 01:39:37.098]  The algorithms that place things, that grab your attention, that focus you on certain... We're fighting AI!
[01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:41.982]  Well, I will not give it the moniker of artificial intelligence.
[01:39:41.982 --> 01:39:43.703]  It's not artificial intelligence.
[01:39:43.703 --> 01:39:45.063]  It's more like skip logic.
[01:39:45.063 --> 01:39:48.625]  You know, if someone likes this, then you're going to bring that into them and show this over here.
[01:39:48.625 --> 01:39:49.605]  And they have pools.
[01:39:49.605 --> 01:39:50.146]  They have pools.
[01:39:50.146 --> 01:40:00.771]  No, no, I agree with you, but the AI in it is that humans are interfacing with it, and then they're able to program us with the information, and we are sentient, so really it's an interface.
[01:40:01.618 --> 01:40:04.460]  Yeah, I think AI is just tossed around really easily.
[01:40:04.460 --> 01:40:04.620]  Sure.
[01:40:04.620 --> 01:40:06.161]  I mean, there's no artificial intelligence.
[01:40:06.161 --> 01:40:06.942]  These are real people.
[01:40:06.942 --> 01:40:09.984]  There's a real movement behind structuring information.
[01:40:09.984 --> 01:40:11.605]  So it's more of an art form?
[01:40:11.605 --> 01:40:12.645]  It's totally an art form.
[01:40:12.645 --> 01:40:13.046]  You're right.
[01:40:13.046 --> 01:40:13.946]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:40:13.946 --> 01:40:17.028]  And there's a lot of people doing it.
[01:40:17.028 --> 01:40:18.489]  Amazing.
[01:40:18.489 --> 01:40:19.610]  Stone, thank you so much.
[01:40:19.610 --> 01:40:22.092]  You're going to be on in about an hour and a half.
[01:40:22.092 --> 01:40:27.175]  I really appreciate you being a stalwart, not backing down in the face of all the bullying.
[01:40:27.175 --> 01:40:27.976]  It is getting intense.
[01:40:29.395 --> 01:40:36.801]  Alex, always great to be with you and we will have some more exclusive breaking news here at InfoWars at 2 p.m.
[01:40:36.801 --> 01:40:38.103]  Central, 3 p.m.
[01:40:38.103 --> 01:40:38.843]  Eastern.
[01:40:38.843 --> 01:40:40.765]  Absolutely.
[01:40:40.765 --> 01:40:44.388]  Folks, as a joke, Jersey, get his hotel, have a courier, I don't care what it costs.
[01:40:44.388 --> 01:40:46.510]  I was going to say, we must be able to get someone with a mic over.
[01:40:46.510 --> 01:40:49.272]  Let's have a courier, or go over there and bring him a mic.
[01:40:49.272 --> 01:40:54.777]  It doesn't sound bad, but he's going to be on over 100 radio stations with an internal mic on a laptop.
[01:40:54.977 --> 01:41:00.682]  And the reason I'm flipping out about this on air now is, all these hosts and people trying to get lined up, they just won't stop doing it.
[01:41:00.682 --> 01:41:06.587]  I mail them mics, I mail them iPads, I mail them computers, to the point where we're going to go bankrupt here, and it's, I love Roger Tedeschi.
[01:41:06.587 --> 01:41:08.409]  This is why I never have guests on my show.
[01:41:08.409 --> 01:41:10.150]  You can't count on them to do it right.
[01:41:10.150 --> 01:41:11.171]  And that's why you're here.
[01:41:11.171 --> 01:41:11.852]  Yes.
[01:41:11.852 --> 01:41:14.334]  And you were just here like a year ago, and I said, where's Adam Curry?
[01:41:14.334 --> 01:41:14.974]  He's so awesome.
[01:41:14.974 --> 01:41:19.458]  Because I was watching old videos on MTV, but that's not really your true claim to fame.
[01:41:20.179 --> 01:41:21.100]  It's good to have you here.
[01:41:40.214 --> 01:41:41.716]  It's good to be here, Alex, for sure.
[01:41:41.716 --> 01:41:50.986]  A few weeks ago I wanted to get you in here just about culture and internet censorship and everything, but now you're here in the midst of crazy chipmunk North Korea, the president talking about fiery death and doom.
[01:41:50.986 --> 01:41:52.708]  Well, a little background.
[01:41:52.708 --> 01:41:54.751]  My uncle is Donald Gregg.
[01:41:55.511 --> 01:42:00.873]  And I don't know if you remember who he is, but he was the ambassador to South Korea for several years.
[01:42:00.873 --> 01:42:01.434]  Yes!
[01:42:01.434 --> 01:42:09.737]  He was George H. Walker Bush's national security advisor, longtime CIA guy from the OSS days.
[01:42:09.737 --> 01:42:12.939]  And he's now in his mid-80s and known as Uncle Don to me.
[01:42:13.939 --> 01:42:19.704]  When Rodman was going over there, I had a chance to sit down with my uncle and talk to him and say, what is going on?
[01:42:19.704 --> 01:42:25.569]  And he gave me two hours of, I'm sure he didn't tell me everything because he could never do that, he'd never leave the CIA.
[01:42:25.569 --> 01:42:30.513]  But the first thing he said was, Dennis Rodman knows more about North Korea than anyone in government.
[01:42:30.513 --> 01:42:34.597]  And that's coming from a guy who's been to North Korea five times in the last six years.
[01:42:34.597 --> 01:42:36.558]  Just how insane and quirky and weird it is.
[01:42:37.299 --> 01:42:38.680]  Well, not really.
[01:42:38.680 --> 01:42:42.282]  See, first of all, as you correctly said earlier, we have an armistice with North Korea.
[01:42:42.282 --> 01:42:44.143]  The war never ended, just a truce.
[01:42:44.143 --> 01:42:46.204]  We're not going to shoot anything, anybody.
[01:42:46.204 --> 01:42:51.588]  All they want is to be seen as a full-fledged player on the international scale.
[01:42:51.588 --> 01:42:54.810]  And that has been denied for one reason, well, two reasons.
[01:42:54.810 --> 01:42:59.533]  The military-industrial complex, whenever we need sales to South Korea or in that region,
[01:43:00.513 --> 01:43:01.814]  Oh, we have all kinds of problems.
[01:43:01.814 --> 01:43:03.214]  Oh, they have miniaturized nukes.
[01:43:03.214 --> 01:43:05.215]  So it's a trigger point.
[01:43:05.215 --> 01:43:06.556]  And then, poof, then we sell.
[01:43:06.556 --> 01:43:07.637]  Now, we've been trying to sell.
[01:43:07.637 --> 01:43:10.818]  The new President Park had been very difficult.
[01:43:10.818 --> 01:43:12.639]  He didn't want any missile defense.
[01:43:12.639 --> 01:43:15.341]  We, of course, want missile defense there to keep our eye on China.
[01:43:16.181 --> 01:43:18.423]  North Korea is not suicidal.
[01:43:18.423 --> 01:43:21.807]  I also don't think the President's words meant nuclear war.
[01:43:21.807 --> 01:43:23.729]  I love the words he chose.
[01:43:23.729 --> 01:43:24.329]  Fury.
[01:43:24.329 --> 01:43:27.633]  Fury and fire.
[01:43:27.633 --> 01:43:30.536]  Fury is like a really hot Valkyrie of war, isn't it?
[01:43:30.536 --> 01:43:31.577]  It conjures up images.
[01:43:31.577 --> 01:43:32.678]  He didn't say we're going to nuke you.
[01:43:33.879 --> 01:43:43.529]  And to me, personally, I think it may be another move in his negotiation, because all he has to do is let Kim Jong-un save face one way or the other.
[01:43:43.529 --> 01:43:44.610]  And we may see that happen.
[01:43:44.610 --> 01:43:45.370]  I'm just not buying it.
[01:43:45.370 --> 01:43:49.254]  We're going to play that clip in a moment, but I've got to tell you, Adam, this is amazing analysis.
[01:43:49.254 --> 01:43:51.617]  Because, I mean, what you're saying is really what's going on.
[01:43:52.097 --> 01:43:55.700]  I believe so, and it works, you know, because we all get riled up.
[01:43:55.700 --> 01:44:01.284]  I was in Europe for a couple of weeks, and man, no one was interested in talking about Trump, really.
[01:44:01.284 --> 01:44:03.426]  They were scared to death of North Korea.
[01:44:03.426 --> 01:44:05.348]  Oh my God, what's the crazy guy going to do?
[01:44:05.348 --> 01:44:07.269]  You don't hear it quite that way in the United States.
[01:44:07.269 --> 01:44:10.131]  Well, that's because most of Europe got burned down just 60, 70 years ago.
[01:44:11.172 --> 01:44:12.493]  They still have that memory.
[01:44:12.493 --> 01:44:16.777]  But also, why is it that all of a sudden, oh, he can reach Hawaii?
[01:44:16.777 --> 01:44:19.179]  This same report came out three years ago.
[01:44:19.179 --> 01:44:20.020]  The same thing.
[01:44:20.020 --> 01:44:22.262]  They have a nuke and they might be able to reach ICBM.
[01:44:22.262 --> 01:44:23.543]  And now they can hit Chicago.
[01:44:23.543 --> 01:44:26.045]  But you know why it's Hawaii?
[01:44:26.045 --> 01:44:26.626]  Tulsi Gabbard.
[01:44:27.628 --> 01:44:34.494]  Because she's the Democrat, she's not playing along, she's anti-war, she's in Hawaii.
[01:44:34.494 --> 01:44:36.556]  Let's just make Hawaii a little bit more dangerous.
[01:44:36.556 --> 01:44:40.519]  I think this truly is a big move in the information war.
[01:44:40.519 --> 01:44:48.206]  I'm not quite sure what side all the players are on yet, but definitely it's about weapons, weapons sales, spy stuff, focused in that region.
[01:44:49.947 --> 01:44:51.948]  North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States.
[01:44:51.948 --> 01:44:53.348]  They will be met with fire and fury.
[01:45:20.089 --> 01:45:23.351]  Like the world has never seen.
[01:45:23.351 --> 01:45:29.256]  He has been very threatening beyond a normal state.
[01:45:29.256 --> 01:45:39.003]  And as I said, they will be met with fire, fury, and frankly, power, the likes of which this world has never seen before.
[01:45:39.602 --> 01:45:44.923]  Now, Adam Curry of the noagendashow.com, the father of the podcast system.
[01:45:44.923 --> 01:45:48.464]  I want to get your take on the web and internet and censorship and where you think that's going.
[01:45:48.464 --> 01:45:49.304]  He's been a trailblazer.
[01:45:49.304 --> 01:45:53.285]  Of course, he's also known for being a big DJ and MTV and pioneering that.
[01:45:53.285 --> 01:45:58.786]  But what you said earlier about what you think Trump is doing is smart.
[01:45:58.786 --> 01:46:03.286]  Rex Tillerson was getting on a plane leaving Asia last night and he responded.
[01:46:03.286 --> 01:46:05.527]  And he said, well, we hope to calm things down.
[01:46:07.372 --> 01:46:12.479]  North Korea keeps threatening to blow everybody up, and nothing else has gotten through to them, so maybe this will.
[01:46:12.479 --> 01:46:18.588]  So is there truth to that, or is it like Merkel says, calm down, take Prozac, Trump, everything's your fault?
[01:46:20.165 --> 01:46:24.487]  Well, obviously there are problems, and I go back to my original premise.
[01:46:24.487 --> 01:46:31.069]  The problem is, we want to have stuff in that area to keep our eye on China, which really is, China is, I think, is dangerous.
[01:46:31.069 --> 01:46:40.713]  I mean, there's stuff going on that we really don't understand, don't know much about, and man, do we have cultural differences, incredible cultural differences with the Chinese.
[01:46:41.233 --> 01:46:42.575]  Yeah, Chinese tourists.
[01:46:42.575 --> 01:46:44.257]  I was in Florence.
[01:46:44.257 --> 01:46:47.981]  You know, they're spitting on the ground, they're hawking everywhere, they're rude, they push you around.
[01:46:47.981 --> 01:46:48.662]  That's their culture.
[01:46:48.662 --> 01:46:50.444]  They don't deem that to be rude.
[01:46:50.444 --> 01:46:53.207]  We are very incompatible from everything that I've seen.
[01:46:53.207 --> 01:46:55.570]  And I'm just talking about the people that come to...
[01:46:55.950 --> 01:46:56.350]  That's the thing.
[01:46:56.350 --> 01:46:57.932]  I'm not bashing Chinese people.
[01:46:57.932 --> 01:47:05.418]  My sister's Korean-adopted, but she's completely different than people you run into who are from Korea, where it's a total caste society.
[01:47:05.418 --> 01:47:06.799]  Men are, like, totally in charge.
[01:47:06.799 --> 01:47:07.780]  The liberals don't care about that.
[01:47:07.780 --> 01:47:08.701]  That's fine.
[01:47:08.701 --> 01:47:10.802]  And, I mean, it's almost like a hive or something.
[01:47:10.802 --> 01:47:13.064]  They're very smart people, but it's like a beehive.
[01:47:13.064 --> 01:47:17.228]  Then you talk to Paul Watson, who was married to a Chinese lady for a while, and he went there a lot.
[01:47:17.708 --> 01:47:24.656]  And I'm not going to get into the whole story, but they sort of get messages from China, watch what you're saying, even though they didn't, the family didn't even live in China, they were visiting people.
[01:47:24.656 --> 01:47:30.121]  And he said exactly, even the nice area, people just pull their pants down, start crapping, push you out of the way.
[01:47:30.121 --> 01:47:33.305]  The biggest group is Chinese women coming here to have babies for free.
[01:47:33.305 --> 01:47:37.029]  That's, there's more Chinese women than all Mexicans coming here.
[01:47:37.469 --> 01:47:38.830]  I mean, it's insane.
[01:47:38.830 --> 01:47:40.151]  In California, this happens a lot.
[01:47:40.151 --> 01:47:43.794]  And we're such an open, good society, I'm not being xenophobic.
[01:47:43.794 --> 01:47:52.041]  I'm saying, you go to China, ask for something for free, the police cut your testicles off, stab you in each thigh artery, and wait for you to bleed to death.
[01:47:52.041 --> 01:47:52.841]  But that's the standard deal.
[01:47:52.841 --> 01:47:57.866]  Cut your testicles off, if you're a man, stab you in each, what is it, ephemeral artery, and let you bleed out.
[01:47:57.866 --> 01:47:59.707]  I'm canceling my trip to China.
[01:47:59.707 --> 01:48:01.348]  This is not a good place to be.
[01:48:01.348 --> 01:48:03.130]  Well, you showed your astuteness, so I'm ranting.
[01:48:03.130 --> 01:48:05.652]  Sorry, get back into all the players.
[01:48:05.652 --> 01:48:06.953]  And now they're threatening war with India.
[01:48:08.214 --> 01:48:12.937]  That, that is probably more precarious.
[01:48:12.937 --> 01:48:18.981]  I mean, when you get into India and Pakistan, these are the nuclear powers that I believe we should be wary of.
[01:48:18.981 --> 01:48:24.805]  Not necessarily, you know, all freaking out, but, you know, that has been a big issue for a long time.
[01:48:24.805 --> 01:48:27.707]  And that's, we know that they have nuclear weapons.
[01:48:27.707 --> 01:48:29.528]  We're not, I mean, a report came out.
[01:48:29.528 --> 01:48:31.789]  Adam Currie, address America in camera four.
[01:48:31.789 --> 01:48:37.413]  It's really always about selling stuff so that we can kill brown people in sandy areas.
[01:48:39.747 --> 01:48:44.509]  And then what's the cultural deal with bringing in the most radical, battle-hardened males?
[01:48:44.509 --> 01:48:52.391]  While you're attacking and stirring up Islam and putting radicals in, then why do you then flood Europe with military-age men running around like pirate ships docking?
[01:48:52.391 --> 01:48:54.512]  Well, that's different.
[01:48:54.512 --> 01:48:56.413]  That is part of the Kalergi Plan.
[01:48:56.413 --> 01:48:58.474]  I don't know if you've ever heard of that Kalergi Plan.
[01:48:58.474 --> 01:49:05.156]  And they still give out awards, the Kalergi Award for furthering the European Union.
[01:49:05.156 --> 01:49:06.456]  Merkel won that recently.
[01:49:06.456 --> 01:49:07.857]  They want to expand that into the Middle East.
[01:49:08.177 --> 01:49:17.019]  Well, and the idea is to create a uniform, it literally calls for people who look like Egyptians, brown, and that's happening.
[01:49:17.019 --> 01:49:20.880]  I mean, I grew up in Amsterdam, and I saw the transition.
[01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:32.202]  First it was Turkish, and then Moroccan, and now we have, you know, second, third generation, kids born in the Netherlands, and people just start to become browns, you know, the culture kind of flows, the whole multicultural society.
[01:49:32.202 --> 01:49:35.163]  That was the idea, is to have a big mass of people
[01:49:35.703 --> 01:49:48.093]  Bring in people who can do the work that the old people, the whitish people, the Europeans as we know them, don't want to do, and slowly create a big, and I'm not making this up, and this is not a conspiracy.
[01:49:48.093 --> 01:49:56.080]  Peter Sutherland, the head of the EU, now the head of the cultural enrichment program, Open Borders, that's what they actually call it, said we've got it in Europe being white.
[01:49:56.080 --> 01:49:56.781]  But here's the thing.
[01:49:57.361 --> 01:50:03.149]  They don't want to get rid of the culture of big beautiful buildings and juries and property.
[01:50:03.149 --> 01:50:06.333]  I mean, they're bringing in the muzzles because they want to make it authoritarian.
[01:50:06.997 --> 01:50:10.159]  Yes, and that's what the elites always want to do.
[01:50:10.159 --> 01:50:15.022]  They want to make sure that people are quiet, docile, and don't steal their stuff.
[01:50:15.022 --> 01:50:16.282]  And just go along with the program.
[01:50:16.282 --> 01:50:18.764]  And the elites, they're never going to have their kids marry any of the others.
[01:50:18.764 --> 01:50:23.146]  Look at what happened, just the creation of the European Union with the Lisbon Treaty.
[01:50:23.146 --> 01:50:23.947]  France said no.
[01:50:23.947 --> 01:50:24.887]  The Netherlands said no.
[01:50:24.887 --> 01:50:26.568]  Oh, okay, that's too bad.
[01:50:26.568 --> 01:50:27.729]  Let's do that vote over again.
[01:50:28.249 --> 01:50:29.611]  Ireland said no.
[01:50:29.611 --> 01:50:30.492]  Ireland, do it again.
[01:50:30.492 --> 01:50:31.673]  Let's do it again.
[01:50:31.673 --> 01:50:32.334]  Much better outcome.
[01:50:32.334 --> 01:50:35.157]  Just like Brexit, we're doing it again.
[01:50:35.157 --> 01:50:37.059]  I've been waiting for that maybe to happen.
[01:50:37.059 --> 01:50:39.381]  Well, they're saying, let me have another vote now, because it's not clear.
[01:50:39.381 --> 01:50:41.183]  This referendum was done right.
[01:50:41.183 --> 01:50:42.384]  It was stupid people.
[01:50:42.384 --> 01:50:43.726]  That's what I read in The Independent.
[01:50:43.726 --> 01:50:47.309]  Stupid people who voted for Brexit, who were under-educated.
[01:50:48.090 --> 01:50:55.639]  Well, notice, they could have easily shipped people in from somewhere in Asia, or Brazil, or something that would be more culturally compatible with Europe.
[01:50:55.639 --> 01:51:02.587]  But they literally say, we want the worst Muslim countries, we're totally barbarous, let's ship them in and have them be the new bosses.
[01:51:02.587 --> 01:51:03.889]  We'll be right back with Adam Curry.

[01:51:37.750 --> 01:51:39.611]  A real zinc shortage is upon us.
[01:51:39.611 --> 01:51:47.697]  The Wall Street Journal says zinc supplies are down to three weeks, mine supplies struggling to meet demand, and no major discoveries in the last 22 years.
[01:51:47.697 --> 01:51:48.838]  What's it mean for you?
[01:51:48.838 --> 01:51:54.642]  Keith Neumeyer, who's made hundreds of millions investing in hard asset mining plays, is making his biggest call yet.

[01:54:15.362 --> 01:54:18.947]  Everybody knows that the days are loaded.
[01:54:18.947 --> 01:54:24.534]  Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed.
[01:54:24.534 --> 01:54:29.161]  Everybody knows the war is over.
[01:54:29.161 --> 01:54:29.822]  Everybody knows.
[01:54:34.163 --> 01:54:36.704]  Allergies are getting worse and worse all over the world.
[01:54:36.704 --> 01:54:38.765]  They know it's connected to GMOs and other things.
[01:54:38.765 --> 01:54:44.387]  We'll talk about that with a really smart guy, Adam Curry, who was in there like a year ago, and I thought, I want to get this guy on every week.
[01:54:44.387 --> 01:54:47.288]  And then just a year goes by, like 10 seconds, and I remember to get him back.
[01:54:47.288 --> 01:54:55.711]  So fellow Austinite, curry.com, nojendashow.com, very, very popular podcast, reaching millions of people every week.
[01:54:55.711 --> 01:54:59.352]  The podcast father, and he's here to talk about now censorship.
[01:54:59.952 --> 01:55:11.862]  Where he sees all this going, it's so surreal, not to make myself the center of attention, but seriously, to have the Federal Elections Commission, we want subpoenas of Jones and his Russian funding, and his Martian funding.
[01:55:11.862 --> 01:55:25.413]  It's just, it's like surreal to be in a Seven Days in May movie, but we're all in it, and now Google and everybody admits they're going to censor, and they call it left-wing versus right-wing, but it's really anybody that's, I wouldn't call you right-wing,
[01:55:26.374 --> 01:55:27.395]  What is currently happening?
[01:55:27.395 --> 01:55:37.589]  You're a pioneer in television and MTV, in computers, in independent broadcasting, in podcasting called The Podfather.
[01:55:37.589 --> 01:55:39.212]  Where would you say we are right now?
[01:55:39.212 --> 01:55:41.615]  Well, in the United States, we're at an interesting point.
[01:55:41.995 --> 01:55:50.981]  Just to go back to the European Union, they have a whole tolerance directive, which was launched several years ago, and from this stems the laws.
[01:55:50.981 --> 01:55:54.244]  They're not allowed to say negative things about migrants or refugees.
[01:55:54.244 --> 01:55:57.606]  And now they're getting rid of the soccer teams having national names?
[01:55:57.606 --> 01:56:01.629]  You were also telling me about the anthem, and they've now changed that.
[01:56:02.009 --> 01:56:04.831]  Oh, well, that was just part of what we were talking about, the Kalergi Plan.
[01:56:04.831 --> 01:56:09.373]  The plan was to make Beethoven's Ode to Joy the national anthem of the European Union.
[01:56:09.373 --> 01:56:12.335]  That plan was written quite a while ago, and today it is fact.
[01:56:12.335 --> 01:56:16.077]  Just to kind of show you that- Just to show that they're following this- Implemented.
[01:56:16.077 --> 01:56:20.220]  Now, when it comes to censorship in the United States, there's something a little more nefarious going on.
[01:56:20.780 --> 01:56:24.662]  Once again, the debate has been reignited about net neutrality.
[01:56:24.662 --> 01:56:28.305]  This is a plan to regulate the Internet.
[01:56:28.305 --> 01:56:30.206]  And it's done in such a great way.
[01:56:30.206 --> 01:56:31.987]  And by the way, it's completely paid for.
[01:56:31.987 --> 01:56:34.889]  All these organizations fight for the future, all of that.
[01:56:34.889 --> 01:56:46.576]  They're all small NGOs that are funded by Google and by Amazon and other big players in the Internet space in the United States.
[01:56:46.576 --> 01:56:48.577]  The idea is, under the guise of
[01:56:48.997 --> 01:56:53.458]  Oh, everything should be equal, everything should be fair, they're going to be able to regulate.
[01:56:53.458 --> 01:57:03.341]  And once you get one foot in the door to write one rule, and it's disguised as everything will be okay except for illegal traffic on the computer network.
[01:57:03.341 --> 01:57:04.541]  So what's illegal traffic?
[01:57:04.541 --> 01:57:07.662]  Right now it's not defined, but that could be BitTorrent, it could be...
[01:57:09.002 --> 01:57:10.902]  I've gotten to the point where I have to file a lawsuit now.
[01:57:10.902 --> 01:57:12.383]  We're just looking at what company.
[01:57:12.383 --> 01:57:16.863]  Every major company we go to for credit card processing or... This is the problem.
[01:57:16.863 --> 01:57:18.544]  They're going to go after the money.
[01:57:18.544 --> 01:57:23.104]  So they're going after all the places where you can get money to fund your operation.
[01:57:23.104 --> 01:57:25.545]  Just like what happened with WikiLeaks and PayPal.
[01:57:25.545 --> 01:57:26.725]  It's exactly the same thing.
[01:57:26.725 --> 01:57:28.765]  That is what... So it's an act of resistance.
[01:57:28.765 --> 01:57:30.206]  I haven't plugged once this hour.
[01:57:30.206 --> 01:57:31.606]  You go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:57:31.606 --> 01:57:37.507]  Seriously, great supplements, great products, great organic coffee, t-shirts, air filtration.
[01:57:37.987 --> 01:57:40.988]  I'm jacked up on male vitality pills right now, Alex.
[01:57:40.988 --> 01:57:48.350]  Well, it looks like you're a pretty virile guy, but I mean, I'll tell you, it has certainly helped me big time.
[01:57:48.350 --> 01:57:49.110]  I'm not kidding.
[01:57:49.110 --> 01:57:49.630]  I've tried them.
[01:57:49.630 --> 01:57:51.151]  I got a whole box last time.
[01:57:51.151 --> 01:57:51.691]  Absolutely.
[01:57:51.691 --> 01:57:53.231]  DNA repair, the whole deal.
[01:57:53.231 --> 01:57:58.953]  Well, I mean, we go out and find out whatever the top of the line stuff is, and then we private label it or develop it.
[01:57:58.953 --> 01:57:59.593]  I'm 70.
[01:57:59.593 --> 01:58:00.914]  Look at me.
[01:58:00.914 --> 01:58:01.254]  You are not 70.
[01:58:02.768 --> 01:58:04.248]  You look younger than me and I know that.
[01:58:04.248 --> 01:58:05.529]  Listen, I've put myself through a lot.
[01:58:05.529 --> 01:58:06.129]  You're younger than me.
[01:58:06.129 --> 01:58:07.009]  I know you're younger.
[01:58:07.009 --> 01:58:09.270]  I mean, I've had my face beat in probably a hundred times.
[01:58:09.270 --> 01:58:10.570]  It never happened to me, thank God.
[01:58:10.570 --> 01:58:11.371]  Yeah, it's a good thing.
[01:58:11.371 --> 01:58:12.211]  I used to look different.
[01:58:12.211 --> 01:58:14.031]  You used to look at photos of me before I got my face beat in.
[01:58:14.031 --> 01:58:15.292]  You were a good looking guy.
[01:58:15.292 --> 01:58:17.833]  I saw a picture when you were like, you know, maybe in your 20s.
[01:58:17.833 --> 01:58:19.473]  Holy crap!
[01:58:19.473 --> 01:58:20.913]  It's all bashed in and all beat in.
[01:58:20.913 --> 01:58:21.314]  It's good, though.
[01:58:21.314 --> 01:58:22.054]  Hot looking, baby.
[01:58:22.054 --> 01:58:23.174]  Hot, hot, hot.
[01:58:23.174 --> 01:58:25.075]  Well, look, we're going to go out later.
[01:58:25.075 --> 01:58:26.115]  I'll give you a signed photo.
[01:58:26.115 --> 01:58:27.215]  Stop it out here.
[01:58:27.215 --> 01:58:27.696]  We're gay.
[01:58:27.696 --> 01:58:28.536]  It's all true.
[01:58:28.536 --> 01:58:31.637]  Hey, ladies and gentlemen, and then we'll be kicked off the air for being homophobic.
[01:58:31.637 --> 01:58:32.177]  Now, it's a joke.
[01:58:32.677 --> 01:58:35.038]  Just like they're probably going to kick Milo off for being homophobic.
[01:58:35.038 --> 01:58:37.079]  Seriously, they're saying he is for making gay jokes.
[01:58:37.079 --> 01:58:37.799]  It's free for all!
[01:58:37.799 --> 01:58:38.379]  It's America!
[01:58:38.379 --> 01:58:39.180]  It's free speech!
[01:58:39.180 --> 01:58:41.981]  It's Adam Curry, the founder of vodcasting.

[01:58:57.654 --> 01:59:04.158]  More than two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has been called the Iodine Conspiracy.
[01:59:04.158 --> 01:59:16.965]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ, and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, a bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[01:59:17.165 --> 01:59:20.808]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[01:59:20.808 --> 01:59:27.795]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[01:59:27.795 --> 01:59:40.687]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[01:59:40.687 --> 01:59:42.108]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[01:59:42.508 --> 01:59:48.892]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.
[01:59:48.892 --> 01:59:53.074]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:59:53.074 --> 01:59:54.635]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:18.755 --> 02:00:19.896]  Big Brother.
[02:00:19.896 --> 02:00:21.678]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:21.678 --> 02:00:23.579]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:23.579 --> 02:00:25.261]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:00:25.261 --> 02:00:26.922]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:26.922 --> 02:00:31.586]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:35.373 --> 02:00:36.553]  Adam Curry's our guest.
[02:00:36.553 --> 02:00:40.494]  Coming up, we're going to take your phone call specifically on North Korea.
[02:00:40.494 --> 02:00:41.914]  What do you think about it?
[02:00:41.914 --> 02:00:43.395]  Where do you think it's going?
[02:00:43.395 --> 02:00:47.096]  We know that the globalists are making money off of it, manipulating, using it as a trigger point.
[02:00:47.096 --> 02:00:50.156]  But still, Kim Jong-un looks like a demonic ferret.
[02:00:50.156 --> 02:00:53.317]  He kills his family members with poison and mortar attacks.
[02:00:53.317 --> 02:00:55.217]  He's threatening to nuke everybody.
[02:00:55.217 --> 02:00:58.378]  It's just comical, like cartoon world to watch it.
[02:00:58.378 --> 02:00:59.098]  But it's real.
[02:00:59.098 --> 02:01:01.599]  But remember, most of those people are brainwashed slaves.
[02:01:02.299 --> 02:01:04.180]  And literally don't know what planet they're on.
[02:01:04.180 --> 02:01:07.643]  So, Adam Curry getting back to that and back into the censorship.
[02:01:07.643 --> 02:01:10.565]  Nothing is as good for censorship as a big war.
[02:01:10.565 --> 02:01:11.946]  What if things get out of hand?
[02:01:11.946 --> 02:01:14.828]  You were getting into Trump saying he was pretty smart what he's doing.
[02:01:14.828 --> 02:01:16.249]  What do you think?
[02:01:16.249 --> 02:01:27.596]  Well, again, I like the words that he used in this case and I have thought for quite a while that the idea would be, and Park in South Korea is definitely
[02:01:29.153 --> 02:01:33.694]  I think he's amenable to the idea of a reunification.
[02:01:33.694 --> 02:01:40.296]  Before this recent event, he was talking about having North and South Koreans together on an Olympic team.
[02:01:40.296 --> 02:01:43.817]  So that, of course, I'm amazed the guy's still alive, quite honestly.
[02:01:43.817 --> 02:01:47.739]  So now this has been flipped, and I don't know about this report.
[02:01:49.239 --> 02:01:49.920]  Very WMD-ish in Iraq.
[02:02:06.175 --> 02:02:09.219]  Yeah, aluminum tubes and yellow cake and all that kind of stuff.
[02:02:09.219 --> 02:02:11.121]  And they've got a reactor buried under a rose bush.
[02:02:11.121 --> 02:02:14.746]  But I haven't actually had the opportunity to see where the report came from.
[02:02:14.746 --> 02:02:16.348]  What's the genesis of that report?
[02:02:16.348 --> 02:02:16.908]  I really don't know.
[02:02:16.908 --> 02:02:18.190]  And it's not discussed on the mainstream.
[02:02:18.190 --> 02:02:19.852]  So what are the real crisis points?
[02:02:19.852 --> 02:02:22.095]  And I think it's India and China threatening a new war.
[02:02:22.952 --> 02:02:27.774]  Yeah, I would say we have to look for that.
[02:02:27.774 --> 02:02:34.997]  This duck and cover mentality that is kind of building again in Europe, first and foremost, I'm just not a believer in it.
[02:02:34.997 --> 02:02:38.239]  Why do you think in Europe, where you say you were just worried, that they're so freaked out?
[02:02:38.239 --> 02:02:39.479]  Because I've been around Europeans.
[02:02:39.479 --> 02:02:45.262]  When I was out in Hawaii, I ran into French and some Dutch and they were all, Kim Jong-un, madman, must stop him.
[02:02:45.262 --> 02:02:47.943]  And I'm like, of course, obviously he is a madman, but I mean,
[02:02:48.063 --> 02:02:59.970]  Well, in general, and I read Dutch, and German, and English, and to some degree some French, I can see how the... Are you sure it's your uncle that was in the CIA?
[02:02:59.970 --> 02:03:02.171]  You know, I was waiting for that.
[02:03:02.171 --> 02:03:03.972]  I am the black sheep of the family, sadly.
[02:03:03.972 --> 02:03:05.212]  I'm just joking.
[02:03:05.212 --> 02:03:06.513]  Only!
[02:03:06.513 --> 02:03:08.214]  Listen to this, I'm at family reunions.
[02:03:08.214 --> 02:03:09.395]  You're too good for the CIA.
[02:03:09.395 --> 02:03:14.758]  Family reunions, and then some, you know, nephew, back, cousin, whatever will say,
[02:03:15.658 --> 02:03:17.819]  Yeah, I can't talk about that because you don't have clearance.
[02:03:17.819 --> 02:03:19.861]  And I have to leave the room in my family reunion.
[02:03:19.861 --> 02:03:20.761]  They act like they're all cool.
[02:03:20.761 --> 02:03:24.563]  When most of the stuff they got is the same stuff that's out there.
[02:03:24.563 --> 02:03:25.063]  Probably.
[02:03:25.063 --> 02:03:26.644]  You know, they use security clearance.
[02:03:26.644 --> 02:03:28.585]  You'd have echo chambers of BS.
[02:03:28.585 --> 02:03:29.466]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:03:29.466 --> 02:03:30.627]  So they can really put out some mold.
[02:03:30.627 --> 02:03:32.528]  Let me tell you, when it comes to Russia...
[02:03:33.451 --> 02:03:40.138]  Wow, they really have an incredible, my family, an incredible hatred of Russia, completely see Putin.
[02:03:40.138 --> 02:03:45.523]  Where does that come from when it was western intellectuals that infested Russia with Bolshevik garbage?
[02:03:45.523 --> 02:03:46.544]  I can tell you.
[02:03:46.544 --> 02:03:50.629]  Like we gave Russia AIDS, and then they tried to give it back to us.
[02:03:51.189 --> 02:03:54.970]  Well, my family certainly, all living in the D.C.
[02:03:54.970 --> 02:04:02.132]  area, they remember very well having to go into the basement when they heated up with the Cold War.
[02:04:02.132 --> 02:04:03.592]  And certainly the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[02:04:03.592 --> 02:04:06.693]  They've been through... They're ten minutes ahead!
[02:04:06.693 --> 02:04:09.634]  Yeah, well, it's Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.
[02:04:09.634 --> 02:04:12.275]  And when you have that, and that's something we should actually talk about,
[02:04:13.575 --> 02:04:15.616]  Post-traumatic stress disorder can come from a number of things.
[02:04:15.616 --> 02:04:22.758]  It can come from eating disorders, it can come from severe psychological impacts that have happened to you.
[02:04:22.758 --> 02:04:29.659]  I think that Hillary Clinton losing the election created an enormous... Trump derangement syndrome.
[02:04:29.659 --> 02:04:31.260]  I'm just talking about PTSD.
[02:04:31.260 --> 02:04:36.801]  The thing about PTSD is when you get it, it actually changes the nature of your brain.
[02:04:36.801 --> 02:04:40.022]  Your hippocampus, the frontal cortex starts to shrink.
[02:04:40.702 --> 02:04:46.967]  And the amygdala starts to grow and the synapses... So they're going back to the more crocodile brain and this is causing the TDS?
[02:04:46.967 --> 02:04:53.511]  And then words that seem threatening are perceived as actual violence and often are returned with actual violence.
[02:04:53.511 --> 02:04:56.794]  Well let's talk about TDS and how it's spreading.
[02:04:56.794 --> 02:05:01.777]  Because whether you love Trump or hate him, I mean he basically has a JFK model of the economy and stuff.
[02:05:01.777 --> 02:05:03.098]  The guy's not really even a Republican.
[02:05:03.098 --> 02:05:05.220]  What are they flipping out about with the TDS?
[02:05:07.485 --> 02:05:09.587]  Joe Biggs here with Infowars.com.
[02:05:09.587 --> 02:05:11.909]  Today I want to talk to you about guns.
[02:05:11.909 --> 02:05:12.970]  Why we have them.
[02:05:12.970 --> 02:05:16.354]  Why the Bill of Rights guarantees that we can have them.
[02:05:16.354 --> 02:05:21.839]  And why my right to have a gun is more important than your right to rail against it in the press.
[02:05:21.839 --> 02:05:28.765]  I believe every good journalist needs to know why the Second Amendment must be considered more essential than the First Amendment.
[02:05:28.885 --> 02:05:39.611]  This may be a bitter pill to swallow, but the right to keep and bear arms is not an outdated, dusty idea some old dead white guys dreamed up in fear of the redcoats.
[02:05:39.611 --> 02:05:43.253]  No, it is just as essential to liberty today as it was in 1776.
[02:05:45.154 --> 02:05:52.320]  The original amendments we refer to as the Bill of Rights contain ten of what the constitutional framers termed unalienable rights.
[02:05:52.320 --> 02:05:54.962]  The Bill of Rights came to us with blinders on.
[02:05:54.962 --> 02:05:57.825]  It doesn't recognize color, or class, or wealth.
[02:05:57.825 --> 02:06:04.410]  It protects not just the rights of actors, or editors, or reporters, but extends even to those we love to hate.
[02:06:04.410 --> 02:06:07.132]  This is a small excerpt from Charlton Heston.
[02:06:07.132 --> 02:06:11.476]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[02:06:11.796 --> 02:06:24.745]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[02:06:24.745 --> 02:06:31.309]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[02:06:31.309 --> 02:06:33.771]  And so I set out to develop caveman.
[02:06:33.831 --> 02:06:44.678]  But to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[02:07:07.053 --> 02:07:11.056]  A new shipment of Bio-True Selenium is now available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:07:11.056 --> 02:07:12.517]  We've been sold out for months.
[02:07:12.517 --> 02:07:17.580]  Our one-of-a-kind Infowarslife Bio-True Selenium formula is now back in stock at Infowarslife.com.
[02:07:17.580 --> 02:07:21.723]  This is the true selenium formula that has rocked the nutraceutical industry to its core.
[02:07:21.723 --> 02:07:26.266]  Nearly every other selenium supplement on the market is produced with synthetic selenium.
[02:07:26.266 --> 02:07:29.468]  But Bio-True Selenium is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[02:07:34.031 --> 02:07:34.591]  I don't know.
[02:08:01.067 --> 02:08:03.128]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight.
[02:08:03.128 --> 02:08:04.629]  This is the time to support InfoWars.
[02:08:04.629 --> 02:08:12.852]  That's InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:08:12.852 --> 02:08:15.374]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[02:08:15.374 --> 02:08:18.155]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:08:18.155 --> 02:08:21.056]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:08:21.056 --> 02:08:24.678]  My love is in league with the freeway.
[02:08:24.678 --> 02:08:27.119]  Against the fashion world.
[02:08:27.992 --> 02:08:38.782]  Adam Curry is an impressive guy, not just a famous MTV host and radio DJ, but also a learned fellow who's traveled the world and is the father of podcasting and is the podfather.
[02:08:38.782 --> 02:08:45.448]  We're going to be taking your phone calls here in a few minutes on North Korea specifically and global crises.
[02:08:45.448 --> 02:08:46.629]  Trump inherited this.
[02:08:46.629 --> 02:08:51.333]  He didn't give the missiles and the reactors in North Korea for the strategy of tension, so we have an excuse to be there.
[02:08:51.793 --> 02:08:55.355]  Strategy of tension is the right word, absolutely.
[02:08:55.355 --> 02:08:59.058]  But now it still is a monster that's been appeased.
[02:08:59.058 --> 02:09:08.243]  Obama appeased him so much, Kim Jong-un, and of course a lot of experts say that Kim Jong-il was somewhat controlled by China, but there's a major breakaway happening.
[02:09:08.243 --> 02:09:09.344]  From your research, what do you think?
[02:09:10.031 --> 02:09:15.794]  Well, I come back to what I learned from my uncle, you know, who dealt with this.
[02:09:15.794 --> 02:09:21.357]  He's been to North Korea five times or six times in the past five years in his 80s.
[02:09:21.357 --> 02:09:22.818]  He's met with many people.
[02:09:22.818 --> 02:09:30.002]  I think he runs the, he's part of the North Korea Society, which is a think tank, obviously, but with the commerce.
[02:09:30.002 --> 02:09:34.384]  Because what North Korea really would want, what they really, really would want is to be a tourist destination.
[02:09:34.824 --> 02:09:41.752]  They had, remember they had the ski lifts all ready to go and then... And the culture is they like pretty signs and little pretty flowers and... Pyongyang is beautiful.
[02:09:41.752 --> 02:09:44.435]  I mean, I haven't been but it looks really nice.
[02:09:44.435 --> 02:09:45.716]  I mean, I hear a lot.
[02:09:45.716 --> 02:09:46.197]  I've never been.
[02:09:46.197 --> 02:09:48.560]  A lot of insane communist buildings?
[02:09:48.560 --> 02:09:49.020]  I don't know.
[02:09:49.020 --> 02:09:49.701]  I mean, I really...
[02:09:49.701 --> 02:09:50.562]  Here's the toll-free number.
[02:09:50.562 --> 02:09:52.043]  I forgot.
[02:09:52.043 --> 02:09:56.066]  I'm sorry to interrupt.
[02:09:56.066 --> 02:09:56.807]  800-259-9231.
[02:09:56.807 --> 02:09:57.027]  800-259-9231.
[02:09:57.027 --> 02:09:58.608]  Just please be first-time callers.
[02:09:58.608 --> 02:10:00.730]  I want to give folks a chance who haven't been able to get on.
[02:10:00.730 --> 02:10:02.151]  What is your view on North Korea?
[02:10:02.151 --> 02:10:02.772]  What's happening?
[02:10:02.772 --> 02:10:04.353]  The media trying to blame Trump for it.
[02:10:04.353 --> 02:10:07.075]  I'm not here just to defend Trump, but it's crazy.
[02:10:07.075 --> 02:10:10.638]  Where do you think this North Korea thing is going to go if there's not a war?
[02:10:10.638 --> 02:10:12.900]  I hope there's not a war, but it just seems to be escalating.
[02:10:13.755 --> 02:10:20.284]  Well, what I was starting to look in before I came in for the show today was, you know, where are some other military moves happening?
[02:10:20.284 --> 02:10:28.615]  This could also be a bit of, again, going back to where did this report come from that all of a sudden he's miniaturized the nukes and we should be really afraid.
[02:10:28.615 --> 02:10:30.818]  The President's words were not off the cuff.
[02:10:31.599 --> 02:10:36.245]  I mean he chose those words and he has a strategy behind it because you just don't come up with those words like that.
[02:10:36.245 --> 02:10:36.866]  I just don't think so.
[02:10:36.866 --> 02:10:39.249]  I think everything he says is very well thought out.
[02:10:39.249 --> 02:10:49.842]  Obama was the king of that because he would say something and you go back three years and he said it in a way that absolutely could be interpreted the way that he claimed it to be.
[02:10:50.622 --> 02:10:56.867]  And I think that the words fire and fury and power doesn't mean we're going to attack.
[02:10:56.867 --> 02:10:58.388]  It doesn't mean a nuclear war.
[02:10:58.388 --> 02:10:59.528]  We have been flying around.
[02:10:59.528 --> 02:11:00.949]  We do all kinds of sorties.
[02:11:00.949 --> 02:11:02.991]  We do, I mean, ships, submarines.
[02:11:02.991 --> 02:11:08.655]  And again, there's no, there's never been a North Korea for all intents and purposes is still at war.
[02:11:08.655 --> 02:11:09.755]  We just have an armistice.
[02:11:09.755 --> 02:11:11.457]  That's why Trump's saying the policy is.
[02:11:12.097 --> 02:11:14.639]  Maximum pressure and maximum engagement.
[02:11:14.639 --> 02:11:26.347]  And all that has to happen is he has to make a deal, and I think that the President's thinking, I hope, I could be wrong, and if I'm wrong it doesn't matter because we'll all be dead and then who cares what I said.
[02:11:26.347 --> 02:11:37.074]  I think his idea is to pressure Kim Jong-un into giving up his nuclear arsenal, whatever it is, under the auspices of let Kim Jong-un reunify the North and the South.
[02:11:37.975 --> 02:11:42.157]  And maybe like Hong Kong, in 100 years, or 90 years.
[02:11:42.157 --> 02:11:42.977]  Like we're gonna make a deal.
[02:11:42.977 --> 02:11:43.877]  It'll be like Germany.
[02:11:43.877 --> 02:11:47.959]  And that's exactly... Trump at first said, he's a smart cookie, let's work together.
[02:11:47.959 --> 02:11:50.880]  And Kim Jong-un said, I'll nuke, I'll blow you up, I'll kill you.
[02:11:50.880 --> 02:11:54.021]  I mean, he is the one that is initiating things.
[02:11:54.021 --> 02:11:55.941]  I know McMaster then says, we may have to privately strike.
[02:11:55.941 --> 02:11:58.502]  Well, yeah, if we're gonna hit him, we better hit him first.
[02:11:58.502 --> 02:11:59.963]  They're gonna blow up Seoul, South Korea.
[02:12:00.623 --> 02:12:03.045]  McMaster is a wild card for me.
[02:12:03.045 --> 02:12:05.126]  I don't know too much about this guy.
[02:12:05.126 --> 02:12:06.027]  I don't know if I like him.
[02:12:06.027 --> 02:12:10.970]  We've confirmed he is giving reports to Soros and was on a Soros major foundation.
[02:12:10.970 --> 02:12:18.775]  And this is so interesting that 10 years ago when I started our show, No Agenda Show, I of course heard you well before we even started that.
[02:12:19.415 --> 02:12:22.416]  All these things that we were... Oh, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[02:12:22.416 --> 02:12:23.937]  You're completely nuts.
[02:12:23.937 --> 02:12:27.038]  All these things, like Soros is a great example.
[02:12:27.038 --> 02:12:28.759]  Everything's Soros, everything's Soros.
[02:12:28.759 --> 02:12:29.559]  Yeah, you're crazy.
[02:12:29.559 --> 02:12:33.000]  And now you can... I can't believe how it's all him.
[02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:36.001]  I don't know how at almost 90 this guy's like... It's amazing.
[02:12:36.001 --> 02:12:37.102]  He is in everything.
[02:12:37.102 --> 02:12:38.202]  I mean, it really is him.
[02:12:38.202 --> 02:12:38.622]  Yeah.
[02:12:38.622 --> 02:12:44.444]  Well, it's Open Society Institute and all of the... The CIA groups and all the foundations and all the other billionaires.
[02:12:44.444 --> 02:12:45.885]  He's kind of the figurehead of it.
[02:12:46.405 --> 02:13:02.252]  Yeah, well, I don't know how much he... he must operate a lot of it himself, but really if you look at all of the groups that, you know, have a million, million and a half dollars from him, that organize protests, that do everything that is generally set up to benefit his trade of usually foreign exchange...
[02:13:03.092 --> 02:13:08.435]  That's always a cut out for media to point at the astroturf and create an illusion.
[02:13:08.435 --> 02:13:09.515]  Always, always.
[02:13:09.515 --> 02:13:19.661]  And he's doing it on behalf of the global elites who want no nations, no borders, everybody be the same, have the same culture, be quiet, just move on, carry on.
[02:13:19.821 --> 02:13:36.434]  And the reason InfoWars is here is I want a true open liberal society, Thomas Jefferson style, and think there should be somebody for the American people, for Renaissance, for free market, for individual property and the Second Amendment and religious freedom, to be religious or not be religious.
[02:13:36.434 --> 02:13:38.255]  And that's, to me, we're true liberals.
[02:13:38.255 --> 02:13:43.940]  And the whole corporate power structure has found their real opposition was from true Western liberalism.
[02:13:43.940 --> 02:13:49.444]  So that's why they fill the vacuum of, quote, liberalism, because they, in truth, are corporate fascists.
[02:13:50.504 --> 02:13:55.690]  Yes, and technology is not going to end very well for us, I believe.
[02:13:55.690 --> 02:14:01.057]  I think it's already being used against us in many ways.
[02:14:01.057 --> 02:14:07.244]  Professor Theodore Kaczynski from Stanford... Turns out he was a prophet!
[02:14:07.865 --> 02:14:15.852]  If you ever read Industrial Society and its future, you'll understand that he predicted all of this would happen.
[02:14:15.852 --> 02:14:18.094]  And by the way, I'm not supporting the bombing or whatever.
[02:14:18.094 --> 02:14:20.877]  That manifesto has nothing... Here's the difference.
[02:14:20.877 --> 02:14:21.498]  We don't know.
[02:14:21.498 --> 02:14:23.479]  He was in the CIA.
[02:14:23.479 --> 02:14:24.921]  But he was MKUltra.
[02:14:24.921 --> 02:14:25.421]  Exactly.
[02:14:25.421 --> 02:14:26.322]  And that's LA Times.
[02:14:26.322 --> 02:14:28.144]  You can't make... I tell people that.
[02:14:29.005 --> 02:14:32.548]  I think I even had, like, Time Magazine, I think it was, go, Jones is crazy!
[02:14:32.548 --> 02:14:35.231]  He said the Unabomber was MKUltra.
[02:14:35.231 --> 02:14:36.392]  It was a fact!
[02:14:36.392 --> 02:14:40.375]  Yeah, he was tortured psychologically, along with others.
[02:14:40.375 --> 02:14:41.636]  He volunteered into it.
[02:14:41.636 --> 02:14:42.457]  At school, at school.
[02:14:42.457 --> 02:14:43.698]  At Stanford.
[02:14:43.698 --> 02:14:45.260]  But you don't, or is it Harvard?
[02:14:45.260 --> 02:14:52.726]  You don't know, you don't know you're signing on to it until lights out, electropulses in your brain, and six months later you're released.
[02:14:53.887 --> 02:14:57.308]  The psychological things that happened to him were very, very nasty.
[02:14:57.308 --> 02:15:01.729]  A lot of sexual deviance and, you know, and exposure of things.
[02:15:01.729 --> 02:15:02.950]  But back to what he wrote.
[02:15:02.950 --> 02:15:03.690]  That's what we've been told.
[02:15:03.690 --> 02:15:05.450]  That's what Alexander Cochran dug up.
[02:15:05.450 --> 02:15:06.491]  Yes.
[02:15:06.491 --> 02:15:11.272]  But when I, much later in life, thought, you know, why would, why would this guy who, you know,
[02:15:11.852 --> 02:15:13.175]  Imagine if he just waited around for the internet!
[02:15:26.075 --> 02:15:26.535]  Right.
[02:15:26.535 --> 02:15:28.036]  But he went through all this trouble!
[02:15:28.036 --> 02:15:29.878]  But he already predicted social networks.
[02:15:29.878 --> 02:15:35.141]  He said, the problem that we will face with technology is over-socialization.
[02:15:35.141 --> 02:15:37.623]  That's how the politically correct culture comes in.
[02:15:37.623 --> 02:15:44.848]  If you're over-socialized, like, you can't say this about, use the wrong pronouns, address someone in the wrong manner.
[02:15:44.848 --> 02:15:45.748]  It's turning into a cult.
[02:15:45.748 --> 02:15:50.872]  But what happens is, there's so many things that you can do wrong, you're always thinking, oh my god, am I saying something wrong?
[02:15:50.872 --> 02:15:54.774]  So you have these filters on, and you become over-socialized, you're afraid to say anything.
[02:15:54.774 --> 02:15:55.835]  It's a panoptagon effect.
[02:15:56.015 --> 02:15:56.111]  Yeah.
[02:15:57.205 --> 02:15:58.366]  Now you're above my pay grade.
[02:15:58.366 --> 02:15:59.206]  No, no.
[02:15:59.206 --> 02:16:05.491]  That was the old French model of putting the guard tower in the middle in a circular prison where you always think you're being watched.
[02:16:05.491 --> 02:16:05.731]  Yes.
[02:16:05.731 --> 02:16:06.751]  So you self-censored.
[02:16:06.751 --> 02:16:07.972]  Yes.
[02:16:07.972 --> 02:16:12.816]  And when he wrote the manifesto, he had no idea that social networks were coming.
[02:16:12.816 --> 02:16:19.700]  And you can see, I mean, I'm on Facebook and Twitter only to see what's happening and to see how the algos are looking at me.
[02:16:19.700 --> 02:16:24.303]  And I think I'm pretty, I can protect myself if I can step back a little bit from it.
[02:16:24.303 --> 02:16:26.885]  But man, it's some very, very dangerous.
[02:16:27.005 --> 02:16:28.686]  I'll tell you how good it is.
[02:16:28.686 --> 02:16:35.512]  I was looking at some discount furniture store thing online, like, you know, $500 couches.
[02:16:35.512 --> 02:16:36.112]  I forget the name of it.
[02:16:36.112 --> 02:16:38.734]  It's on my phone, on my little smart computer.
[02:16:38.734 --> 02:16:45.019]  And then I was up here and I was on Gary McBrain's computer because he was doing some stuff in and out of the room and I was watching some of the work he had on the screen.
[02:16:45.019 --> 02:16:47.742]  One of our video guys, great talent.
[02:16:48.792 --> 02:16:53.835]  And I just went to a few sites, and it knew and popped up that ad.
[02:16:53.835 --> 02:16:59.358]  So the algorithm is so smart that it knows these are Alex Jones computers in general.
[02:16:59.358 --> 02:17:00.899]  And I asked him, I said, has that been popping up?
[02:17:00.899 --> 02:17:02.019]  He goes, no, that hasn't been popping up.
[02:17:02.019 --> 02:17:06.822]  And it was just because of where I went, in like 20 minutes, it knew, oh, that's Alex, and bloop!
[02:17:06.822 --> 02:17:07.342]  Possible.
[02:17:07.342 --> 02:17:13.946]  So it wasn't just targeted mapping of knowing I already looked at something, so it followed me, and then other sites that are in the network show it too.
[02:17:14.266 --> 02:17:21.168]  Now, I'm not going to give them too much credit because I still, every single time I buy something, I get ads for the product that I just bought.
[02:17:21.168 --> 02:17:22.728]  So, I'm not giving them a lot of credit.
[02:17:22.728 --> 02:17:24.209]  They know completely what they're doing.
[02:17:24.209 --> 02:17:26.029]  I just bought ten cuckoo clocks.
[02:17:26.029 --> 02:17:30.291]  Then you should be seeing lots of cuckoo clock ads, because that's how it works, which is very annoying.
[02:17:30.291 --> 02:17:33.932]  Although, I understand from people that that actually does sell more products.
[02:17:33.932 --> 02:17:35.352]  Did you know I did just buy ten cuckoo clocks?
[02:17:38.672 --> 02:17:43.794]  My wife teased me about buying one, so I bought a lot of my friends one.
[02:17:43.794 --> 02:17:44.955]  It's my contribution.
[02:17:44.955 --> 02:17:46.896]  Now, your wife has a mold allergy.
[02:17:46.896 --> 02:17:48.396]  Would you like a cuckoo clock?
[02:17:48.396 --> 02:17:49.397]  I'd love a cuckoo clock.
[02:17:49.397 --> 02:17:50.797]  Let me give your wife some help.
[02:17:50.797 --> 02:17:51.358]  All right.
[02:17:51.358 --> 02:17:57.620]  Because when I moved to Austin six years ago, the second year, it's never in the brochure, Austin, great city, young, fantastic.
[02:17:57.620 --> 02:17:59.161]  But the pollen's like nerve gas.
[02:17:59.161 --> 02:17:59.781]  Wow.
[02:17:59.781 --> 02:18:03.443]  I've never had any type of allergy in my life, and mold hit me.
[02:18:03.443 --> 02:18:07.785]  So right now we've had three weeks of just 100% crazy off-the-chart mold.
[02:18:08.585 --> 02:18:09.966]  You said, let me guess, is she in bed?
[02:18:09.966 --> 02:18:11.387]  Is she sleeping 18 hours a day?
[02:18:11.387 --> 02:18:12.988]  Is she having chills?
[02:18:12.988 --> 02:18:13.709]  That's it.
[02:18:13.709 --> 02:18:18.192]  And the doctor said you have mold, but then they give her some drug that doesn't work, and you said it's an herb.
[02:18:18.192 --> 02:18:21.755]  By the way, we don't own the company, but I'm going to go out, and if it works, I'm going to sell it.
[02:18:21.755 --> 02:18:23.116]  Quercetin is just the name of the herb.
[02:18:23.116 --> 02:18:23.936]  It's not a brand name.
[02:18:23.936 --> 02:18:25.097]  It's just the name of this herb.
[02:18:25.097 --> 02:18:26.899]  Q-U-E-R-C-I-T-I-N, I think.
[02:18:26.899 --> 02:18:27.939]  Quercetin.
[02:18:27.939 --> 02:18:33.984]  And it's a natural product that will, the way it was explained to me... Anti-inflammatory.
[02:18:33.984 --> 02:18:34.784]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:18:34.784 --> 02:18:35.745]  Shrinks your brain a little bit.
[02:18:35.845 --> 02:18:41.889]  That's what the vaccines and everything are doing, the GMO, we're all having allergic responses, and so of course I should go to Herbs.
[02:18:41.889 --> 02:18:47.353]  I know this, I even do it myself, and then they demonize, oh Mother Earth, that doesn't work, but you're saying it worked for you.
[02:18:47.353 --> 02:18:48.474]  I'm here.
[02:18:48.474 --> 02:18:51.396]  By the way, we're not selling Questerton, though I will be within one month.
[02:18:52.376 --> 02:18:54.557]  And I'll buy it from you, because it's a lifesaver.
[02:18:54.557 --> 02:18:55.458]  For me, it's a lifesaver.
[02:18:55.458 --> 02:18:58.039]  Anyone who has mold allergies, specifically.
[02:18:58.039 --> 02:19:00.100]  So what happened when you started taking it?
[02:19:00.100 --> 02:19:02.041]  I didn't have the sleeping anymore.
[02:19:02.041 --> 02:19:03.142]  I didn't have the falling asleep.
[02:19:03.142 --> 02:19:07.183]  I was constantly, literally on the couch, fall asleep.
[02:19:07.183 --> 02:19:08.064]  12, 14 hours a day.
[02:19:08.064 --> 02:19:08.724]  I still have it.
[02:19:08.724 --> 02:19:11.185]  I can feel it coming on a little bit.
[02:19:11.185 --> 02:19:16.328]  I live in a different apartment now, which is more closed off, because we also have construction downtown.
[02:19:16.328 --> 02:19:18.169]  Lord knows what's in the construction duct.
[02:19:18.169 --> 02:19:18.549]  Not good.
[02:19:19.129 --> 02:19:20.451]  Tearing down old buildings?
[02:19:20.451 --> 02:19:20.831]  Not good.
[02:19:20.831 --> 02:19:22.433]  None of it can be good.
[02:19:22.433 --> 02:19:26.157]  And so if I feel it coming on, I take four and I'm pretty good.
[02:19:26.157 --> 02:19:28.159]  Well, you've sold me if it works on my wife.
[02:19:28.159 --> 02:19:29.681]  You know, I've kind of power through it.
[02:19:29.681 --> 02:19:31.683]  We need no agenda question!
[02:19:31.683 --> 02:19:32.544]  I've got a business here!
[02:19:33.968 --> 02:19:37.450]  Austin is a hellhole of mold, the highest recorded on planet Earth.
[02:19:37.450 --> 02:19:38.891]  The mold's mutating.
[02:19:38.891 --> 02:19:48.356]  When you're not getting your incredible anti-mold system for your gut, that's the products at Infowarslife.com, be sure and get Queserton, not available there.

[02:20:04.765 --> 02:20:06.406]  I'm not always gay, but for him I am.
[02:20:06.406 --> 02:20:07.827]  I ordered some Andrew 400.
[02:20:07.827 --> 02:20:10.769]  I'm losing weight around the belly really quickly.
[02:20:10.769 --> 02:20:13.710]  Some of the pants that didn't fit me, now they're falling off my hips.
[02:20:13.710 --> 02:20:16.852]  There's been a noticeable increase in energy.
[02:20:16.852 --> 02:20:17.893]  Then this stuff works.
[02:20:17.893 --> 02:20:18.333]  It does work.
[02:20:18.553 --> 02:20:22.234]  That's what Bill said after taking Andro 400 for a month.
[02:20:22.234 --> 02:20:24.535]  Now listen to what Richard says about Andro 400.

[02:24:09.989 --> 02:24:11.810]  Strange days have found us.
[02:24:11.810 --> 02:24:15.292]  We have a reality TV host as our president, who is a patriot.
[02:24:15.292 --> 02:24:20.075]  It's not perfect, but he really wants to be president.

[02:24:36.685 --> 02:24:37.146]  All of it.
[02:24:37.146 --> 02:24:39.028]  Yeah, he helped found Delta Force.
[02:24:39.028 --> 02:24:40.270]  He did the Camp David Accords.
[02:24:40.270 --> 02:24:42.833]  That was his first big thing, was the psych warfare.
[02:24:42.833 --> 02:24:44.695]  He was a psych warfare guy for the CIA and everything else.
[02:24:44.695 --> 02:24:45.316]  Right, right, right.
[02:24:45.316 --> 02:24:48.680]  But the point is, is that he co-wrote the Tom Clancy books.
[02:24:48.680 --> 02:24:50.222]  He was one of the big sources for Tom Clancy.
[02:24:50.222 --> 02:24:52.525]  Boy, those Clancy books were always predictive, weren't they?
[02:24:52.765 --> 02:24:53.345]  Yeah.
[02:24:53.345 --> 02:24:54.226]  Of what was coming.
[02:24:54.226 --> 02:24:55.247]  Holy crap.
[02:24:55.247 --> 02:24:56.107]  Really predictive.
[02:24:56.107 --> 02:24:57.348]  I've always enjoyed that.
[02:24:57.348 --> 02:24:59.530]  But Chenek was on like 10 years ago.
[02:24:59.530 --> 02:25:08.917]  He's been on this like 15, like predicting, and then the EU's gonna start collapsing, and there's gonna be a big nationalist movement, and then it's gonna happen, and we're gonna have the... He's a pretty smart guy.
[02:25:08.917 --> 02:25:10.178]  Yeah, but he was read in.
[02:25:12.449 --> 02:25:19.755]  And what's your feeling about where we are right now with what would be called the deep state?
[02:25:19.755 --> 02:25:22.357]  I think there's a civil war in the deep state.
[02:25:22.357 --> 02:25:28.862]  There's folks that want prosperity and don't want to have everybody be forced converted to Islam or liberalism.
[02:25:28.862 --> 02:25:32.565]  There's classical liberalism is battling neocons and fake liberals.
[02:25:32.745 --> 02:25:32.905]  That's
[02:25:47.509 --> 02:25:49.109]  The promise was to drain the swamp.
[02:25:49.109 --> 02:25:50.190]  That's right.
[02:25:50.190 --> 02:25:54.010]  It's not that there's suddenly rogue governments doing what they want because Trump's here.
[02:25:54.010 --> 02:25:57.251]  Now they're just working together against him because they're all running their own little kingdoms.
[02:25:57.251 --> 02:26:02.272]  Remember when he was talking to the Russians, to the Russian ambassador in the Oval Office?
[02:26:02.272 --> 02:26:11.314]  And what came out, and I wish I had the exact quote, but even from intelligence officials saying, it's unbelievable that he went off script.
[02:26:11.314 --> 02:26:11.794]  And I'm thinking,
[02:26:12.737 --> 02:26:20.403]  Off script, I mean, when you, so... And he talked to him and said, I'm really worried about the laptops, let's work together, thanks for helping us in Syria with the radical Muslims.
[02:26:20.403 --> 02:26:21.804]  He's the president!
[02:26:21.804 --> 02:26:28.189]  So we've gone from Kennedy with his red line talking to Khrushchev, to now, they said he went off script and gave him secret info.
[02:26:28.189 --> 02:26:35.195]  Because when he talks, it's secret because he's the president, even though it's been in the news for two months, and they talked about it to warn everybody about the laptop bombs.
[02:26:35.700 --> 02:26:41.702]  And my overall point is that I believe they actually give him a script and say, this is what you're going to say.
[02:26:41.702 --> 02:26:44.182]  We've had actors in the White House.
[02:26:44.182 --> 02:26:45.063]  They do give him a briefing.
[02:26:45.063 --> 02:26:46.603]  They go, sir, this is our policy.
[02:26:46.603 --> 02:26:48.043]  This is your policy.
[02:26:48.043 --> 02:26:48.984]  They call it a script.
[02:26:48.984 --> 02:26:50.524]  I think they're giving him a script.
[02:26:50.524 --> 02:26:53.525]  Maybe it's just bullet points, but when he doesn't adhere to it,
[02:26:54.005 --> 02:26:57.028]  That's when all of a sudden we have blood on the moon and everybody's all upset.
[02:26:57.028 --> 02:27:01.831]  So this is the breaking of some form of sub-government.
[02:27:01.831 --> 02:27:04.313]  He's really being the president.
[02:27:04.313 --> 02:27:09.257]  And he goes, the script isn't we shut off our coal and nobody else does when it's totally clean.
[02:27:09.257 --> 02:27:11.919]  And then our energy prices will start going down, which you see happening.
[02:27:11.919 --> 02:27:13.020]  And we're not going to screw Americans.
[02:27:13.020 --> 02:27:14.782]  And they go, sir, it's a much larger plan.
[02:27:15.242 --> 02:27:18.765]  But here's the thing, we're being screwed and he is for us!
[02:27:18.765 --> 02:27:27.131]  And that's why the idiot liberals, when he's carrying out a JFK-style economic plan with classical liberal stuff to help the average person, are bitching about it!
[02:27:27.131 --> 02:27:28.212]  They're stupid!
[02:27:28.212 --> 02:27:34.857]  And we only have to go back to what Kennedy said about the force, the power that no man speaks of.
[02:27:34.857 --> 02:27:40.221]  You only have to go back to the famous military-industrial complex, which Eisenhower
[02:27:40.461 --> 02:27:47.063]  Which actually was, the original term was, academic military industrial complex.
[02:27:47.063 --> 02:27:49.023]  Because of course academia is a part of that.
[02:27:49.023 --> 02:27:51.924]  Well he actually said that in the larger 21 minute speech.
[02:27:51.924 --> 02:27:57.645]  He says a technocracy, he says a technological elite of academics, and he goes then controlling the military industrial complex.
[02:27:57.645 --> 02:27:58.046]  Yeah.
[02:27:58.046 --> 02:27:59.466]  And they always just cut out only that.
[02:28:00.086 --> 02:28:05.691]  But academia is a big part of it, and look at where a lot... My dad was top of his class when he was in high school.
[02:28:05.691 --> 02:28:14.799]  They called a man to UT and said, here's the nuclear reactor nobody knows about, and then, oh, and by the way, we're gonna set up a world government, it's gonna be eugenics, but not the Nazi kind, but the good kind.
[02:28:15.399 --> 02:28:26.182]  Well, it has worked because through academia we are now seeing people, young people, saying we don't want nations, we don't want borders, we want everything to be open.
[02:28:26.182 --> 02:28:28.683]  I know young people in the European Union.
[02:28:28.683 --> 02:28:32.264]  They are so excited about really two things.
[02:28:32.264 --> 02:28:40.126]  The idea that they could travel without a passport, which they call freedom of movement, and they're so dumb they think when Brexit passed, oh my gosh, I can't go to the EU now.
[02:28:41.413 --> 02:28:44.635]  Because, of course, we'll never have a visa and they won't let us in.
[02:28:44.635 --> 02:28:46.115]  But they just did something.
[02:28:46.115 --> 02:28:51.197]  It took them, I think, almost 14 years to get this through and I think it just happened to appease everybody.
[02:28:51.197 --> 02:29:04.883]  In the vacation time, they finally said, okay, if you have a cell phone or SIM card with data in one EU country, you can now roam without any extra cost in another country.
[02:29:04.883 --> 02:29:05.203]  Wow!
[02:29:05.203 --> 02:29:08.165]  June 15th this went in and it's off the chart.
[02:29:09.185 --> 02:29:10.025]  Unbelievably happened.
[02:29:10.025 --> 02:29:13.447]  And it shouldn't take government to have that, because you already have the companies across the line.
[02:29:13.447 --> 02:29:14.427]  Well, they were forced to do it.
[02:29:14.427 --> 02:29:15.408]  The companies were forced to do it.
[02:29:15.408 --> 02:29:15.808]  Exactly.
[02:29:15.808 --> 02:29:22.951]  But it really gave everybody a, wow, now we're really joined, because we can use our cell phones across borders.
[02:29:22.951 --> 02:29:30.514]  And see, now that the EU has pressure against it, it's having to liberalize with more freedoms that they were actually using the EU to deny people.
[02:29:30.514 --> 02:29:32.094]  Yeah, but it's... I have an idea.
[02:29:32.094 --> 02:29:38.437]  Let's ship 10 million military-age men from the Middle East, from the most backward countries, to North Korea.
[02:29:39.901 --> 02:29:43.284]  That would really help North Korea, like it's helping Europe and us, right?
[02:29:43.284 --> 02:29:44.825]  It's an evil plan, Mr. Jones.
[02:29:44.825 --> 02:29:45.246]  An evil plan.
[02:29:45.246 --> 02:29:46.687]  We're going to come back with your phone calls.
[02:29:46.687 --> 02:29:48.348]  Kevin, Max, Paul, Bill, Jay.
[02:29:48.348 --> 02:29:49.929]  You're going to keep riding shotgun with us.
[02:29:49.929 --> 02:29:52.091]  Adam Curry, the father of podcasting is here.
[02:29:52.091 --> 02:29:55.574]  Steve Pucinich to give us the intel on North Korea and more.
[02:29:55.574 --> 02:29:56.975]  We're on the march.
[02:29:56.975 --> 02:29:59.497]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:59.497 --> 02:30:02.180]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:07.904 --> 02:30:20.983]  Police departments across the country are now using an invasive surveillance tool called stingrays, which use cell phone towers to intercept phone calls and text messages without warrants.
[02:30:22.284 --> 02:30:34.273]  The technology comes courtesy of the FBI, who have forced our nation's police departments into signing non-disclosure agreements, forbidding them from publicly talking about the technology.
[02:30:34.273 --> 02:30:50.565]  Needless to say, this is a direct violation of our Fourth Amendment, and they have no legal authority for warrantless stingray spying, where we now know that police are collecting information on thousands of innocent people who are not even suspected of any crimes.
[02:30:51.005 --> 02:30:56.009]  Once again, more evidence that the police state isn't coming, it's already here.
[02:30:56.009 --> 02:31:00.232]  This is Darren McBreen and I invite you to join the resistance.
[02:31:00.232 --> 02:31:01.953]  Infowars.com.
[02:31:06.641 --> 02:31:08.523]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[02:31:08.523 --> 02:31:10.564]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[02:31:10.564 --> 02:31:13.467]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[02:31:13.467 --> 02:31:19.531]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[02:31:19.531 --> 02:31:28.739]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[02:31:28.739 --> 02:31:33.583]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children.
[02:31:33.803 --> 02:31:36.247]  Do the best job you can to purify your air.
[02:31:36.247 --> 02:31:44.280]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[02:31:44.280 --> 02:31:45.261]  The general public doesn't.
[02:31:46.463 --> 02:31:50.387]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[02:31:50.387 --> 02:31:53.971]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[02:31:53.971 --> 02:32:00.678]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[02:32:00.678 --> 02:32:04.783]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:32:06.744 --> 02:32:11.407]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[02:32:11.407 --> 02:32:24.354]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[02:32:24.354 --> 02:32:30.938]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[02:32:30.938 --> 02:32:33.379]  And so I set out to develop caveman.
[02:32:33.459 --> 02:32:44.691]  But to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[02:32:44.691 --> 02:32:47.054]  InfoWars isn't just fighting the globalists.
[02:32:47.054 --> 02:32:48.515]  We're getting results.
[02:32:48.515 --> 02:32:54.482]  And we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.
[02:32:54.622 --> 02:32:57.504]  Caveman is finally back at the InfoWars store.
[02:32:57.504 --> 02:33:04.148]  You can get 25% off the regular price for a limited time only at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free, AAA253-3139.
[02:33:20.530 --> 02:33:24.514]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:24.514 --> 02:33:28.137]  Coming on at six!
[02:33:31.804 --> 02:33:33.666]  And who is this, Adam Curry, bringing us in?
[02:33:33.666 --> 02:33:35.187]  Hey, everybody, I have no idea.
[02:33:35.187 --> 02:33:36.748]  I'm just here as a DJ.
[02:33:36.748 --> 02:33:38.750]  I have all the Lawrence Weld albums, though.
[02:33:38.750 --> 02:33:40.591]  You used to host Headbangers Ball.
[02:33:40.591 --> 02:33:42.353]  Yes, I did.
[02:33:42.353 --> 02:33:44.254]  You know this is the Misfits.
[02:33:44.254 --> 02:33:46.396]  You know this is Hollywood, Babylon.
[02:33:46.396 --> 02:33:47.577]  You know it's the Evil Elvis.
[02:33:47.577 --> 02:33:49.599]  They didn't play that on Headbangers Ball.
[02:33:49.599 --> 02:33:52.061]  We actually had to play Bon Jovi sometimes.
[02:33:52.061 --> 02:33:52.521]  I remember.
[02:33:52.521 --> 02:33:56.965]  Because you could only get really good metal a few hours a week in Dallas when I was growing up.
[02:33:56.965 --> 02:33:57.225]  Midnight to 3.
[02:33:57.225 --> 02:33:57.305]  Yeah.
[02:33:58.746 --> 02:33:59.346]  That's right.
[02:33:59.346 --> 02:34:00.227]  I was up late.
[02:34:00.227 --> 02:34:02.749]  Yeah, what was that program that was on, like, CBS?
[02:34:02.749 --> 02:34:05.971]  Z Rock was syndicated for a while, and it was heavy metal.
[02:34:05.971 --> 02:34:11.134]  But anyways, I would tune in to watch Headbangers Ball, and it was like, then they started, like, putting Bon Jovi on there, and I couldn't watch it.
[02:34:11.134 --> 02:34:12.575]  No, it was horrible.
[02:34:12.575 --> 02:34:13.495]  That was the worst part.
[02:34:13.495 --> 02:34:19.799]  But, you know, so every other video, every other interview was cool, but yeah, and this didn't fit with Headbangers Ball, but that was, you know, the mentality.
[02:34:19.799 --> 02:34:27.444]  MTV had different... Alright, we've got loaded phones, we've got Dr. Steve Pachinik, we've got Adam Curry, founder of podcasting, most famous DJ out there.
[02:34:28.204 --> 02:34:30.286]  Even, you know, bigger than Wolfman Jack.
[02:34:30.286 --> 02:34:31.427]  I mean, you gotta say it.
[02:34:31.427 --> 02:34:42.818]  We got the serious situation with North Korea, all the threats of nuclear war, the president, you know, saying, uh, fire and fury, and then Tillerson saying that, well, he doesn't respond to anything else.
[02:34:42.818 --> 02:34:45.781]  I know that Dr. Sipochenik has been to North Korea recently.
[02:34:45.781 --> 02:34:49.424]  I know that he worked in the State Department and other agencies over there.
[02:34:49.424 --> 02:34:52.807]  And as soon as he came on the line... It's civilian in the State Department.
[02:34:52.887 --> 02:34:56.668]  Yeah, he said, he said, he said, who is, he said, you know who Adam Curry is?
[02:34:56.668 --> 02:34:57.609]  You know who his uncle was?
[02:34:57.609 --> 02:34:59.630]  I guess he was the head of the CIA in Korea.
[02:34:59.630 --> 02:35:04.351]  But, and, and, and, and Pachinik was about how many times he was reprimanded by your uncle, I guess it's 87 now?
[02:35:04.351 --> 02:35:05.332]  Yeah, Uncle Don's about 87.
[02:35:05.332 --> 02:35:13.095]  Yeah, so, so, let's, let's start the story with who you were saying, one of the top North Korea experts is Uncle Don, Dr. Steve Pachinik.
[02:35:13.095 --> 02:35:19.297]  And then we're gonna go to some phone calls for Alex and Paul and Bill and Kevin that have been holding patiently with their questions for, for all you guys.
[02:35:19.297 --> 02:35:21.578]  But I did not intend for you guys to come together here today.
[02:35:21.578 --> 02:35:21.898]  Go ahead.
[02:35:22.598 --> 02:35:45.694]  Well, as fortune would have it, I was a great admirer of your uncle because we worked together and often when I was overseas and exceeded my boundaries, it was Don who would call me in, bring me to the White House, have a very nice lunch and say, I can't say in real words here, but he was very appropriate and I had a great admiration for him.
[02:35:45.694 --> 02:35:47.055]  He is really the finest
[02:35:48.215 --> 02:35:51.477]  That we have produced in the CIA or anywhere else.
[02:35:51.477 --> 02:35:53.057]  He was an incredible individual.
[02:35:53.057 --> 02:35:53.998]  He still is.
[02:35:53.998 --> 02:35:57.459]  I'm going to talk a little bit about North Korea now.
[02:35:57.459 --> 02:36:01.721]  And I don't want to spoil the feast that's going on, the food feast.
[02:36:01.721 --> 02:36:06.163]  But unfortunately, what Trump did had nothing to do with North Korea.
[02:36:06.163 --> 02:36:11.045]  I hate to spoil it for the New York Times, the Washington Post and everybody else.
[02:36:11.045 --> 02:36:13.166]  But everybody called it incorrectly.
[02:36:13.166 --> 02:36:15.267]  For months, I've been on your show and I see
[02:36:15.467 --> 02:36:17.830]  And now they're saying they're about to go to war.
[02:36:24.864 --> 02:36:25.184]  Possibly.
[02:36:25.184 --> 02:36:26.826]  They're not about to go to war.
[02:36:26.826 --> 02:36:28.787]  They are in a war right now.
[02:36:28.787 --> 02:36:34.432]  So what Donald Trump said, basically, was not that he was going to attack North Korea.
[02:36:34.432 --> 02:36:48.303]  This was the signal to Xi Jinping, who was warned by me and others on your show close to a year ago, that if you do not do anything with North Korea, we will hurt your left flank.
[02:36:48.303 --> 02:36:49.804]  And that's exactly what's happening.
[02:36:49.824 --> 02:37:02.593]  You did say that a year ago, you did say that a few weeks ago, so as usual... I say that repeatedly, and quite frankly it's not just myself, it's the people who are involved in this intelligence military community.
[02:37:02.593 --> 02:37:06.456]  And what I'm trying to explain to the world is that we have nothing to...
[02:37:07.056 --> 02:37:10.437]  Concerned, real concerned with North Korea.
[02:37:10.437 --> 02:37:12.898]  Number one, Kim Jong-un is not irrational.
[02:37:12.898 --> 02:37:15.559]  Number two, the country's not going to war.
[02:37:15.559 --> 02:37:18.261]  Number three, it doesn't serve anybody's purpose.
[02:37:18.261 --> 02:37:25.463]  Number four, they're more fearful of China and Japan than they are of anyone else, and also of Russia.
[02:37:25.463 --> 02:37:32.246]  So those of us who want to attack Russia or anybody else, step back a little bit and understand what the strategy is.
[02:37:32.246 --> 02:37:34.587]  And Don Gregg would have understood this perfectly.
[02:37:35.147 --> 02:37:41.313]  Number one, North Korea is really an extension of Xi Jinping or China.
[02:37:41.313 --> 02:37:46.399]  There's no way the nuclear weapons there could have come out of anywhere else but China.
[02:37:46.399 --> 02:37:50.042]  And this is Trump's way of saying to China, we've had it.
[02:37:50.042 --> 02:37:50.963]  I'm exhausted.
[02:37:50.963 --> 02:37:52.585]  I'm tired with you.
[02:37:52.585 --> 02:37:57.570]  And if you think in any way I'm going to back off on you, China, not North Korea,
[02:37:58.150 --> 02:38:00.412]  On China, you see what I'm doing.
[02:38:00.412 --> 02:38:07.837]  And honestly, everybody's attention went to North Korea when I've been warning everybody to look to the borders of Bhutan.
[02:38:07.837 --> 02:38:18.686]  And it was on your show that I said repeatedly, the Indians and the Chinese are now in a conflict over Bhutan, ostensibly over land property, but in reality over water.
[02:38:19.546 --> 02:38:23.828]  And that's what Trump's meeting with the Indian President, Prime Minister, was all about.
[02:38:23.828 --> 02:38:26.050]  Him hugging Trump and the rest of it is.
[02:38:26.050 --> 02:38:29.131]  The word is, that was pretty much clear, an alliance behind the scenes.
[02:38:29.131 --> 02:38:33.473]  I know they've tried to make one with Russia, but the neocons are trying to block that.
[02:38:33.473 --> 02:38:34.054]  What's the query?
[02:38:35.114 --> 02:38:37.556]  That's correct, Alex, but let's go back again.
[02:38:37.556 --> 02:38:39.557]  The neocons are failing.
[02:38:39.557 --> 02:38:49.025]  I mean, that's one of the reasons why I went after Pence to say, if you're going to put back Steve Hadley, you better forget it, because there's no way we're going to accept Steve Hadley.
[02:38:49.025 --> 02:38:51.166]  The intelligence community won't accept him.
[02:38:51.166 --> 02:38:53.668]  This is a guy who's been involved 9-11.
[02:38:53.668 --> 02:38:59.933]  Don Gregg was not a great fan of Hadley, neither am I. The real issue at hand here is Russia works with us.
[02:39:00.433 --> 02:39:02.634]  Russia is on the border of North Korea.
[02:39:02.634 --> 02:39:04.554]  China is on the border of North Korea.
[02:39:04.554 --> 02:39:06.855]  Japan is on its southern flank.
[02:39:06.855 --> 02:39:16.317]  But one of the things America has to understand, and we have not explained it very well, and for many reasons, but Rex Tillerson is an excellent Secretary of State.
[02:39:16.317 --> 02:39:20.558]  He was very calm, and he was very correct when he said, take it easy, America.
[02:39:20.558 --> 02:39:22.158]  We're not going to war.
[02:39:22.158 --> 02:39:24.959]  And we have... He said you can sleep well at night.
[02:39:25.731 --> 02:39:27.612]  Yeah, but it's true.
[02:39:27.612 --> 02:39:29.492]  And we have incredible generals.
[02:39:29.492 --> 02:39:31.473]  Mattis, McMaster, a whole bunch of them.
[02:39:31.473 --> 02:39:31.733]  Kelly.
[02:39:31.733 --> 02:39:38.816]  So you think overall McMaster, because we see all these articles and reports, that it's McMaster in communication with Soros?
[02:39:38.816 --> 02:39:40.956]  Yeah, but forget Soros.
[02:39:40.956 --> 02:39:46.138]  You keep worrying about a man who's not relevant to anything except himself and to the Nazis.
[02:39:46.138 --> 02:39:54.041]  The real issue here is that we have a strategic focus where no one has talked about the fact
[02:39:54.401 --> 02:39:59.002]  We have 450 military bases around China.
[02:39:59.002 --> 02:40:01.463]  China is now in a noose.
[02:40:01.463 --> 02:40:10.246]  We can tighten the noose and make China really hurt because this is not just a situation where it's economic embargo to North Korea.
[02:40:10.246 --> 02:40:14.907]  This is in a situation where China knows it's surrounded by our military forces.
[02:40:15.547 --> 02:40:20.849]  That Twitter account was really directed to President Xi Jinping.
[02:40:20.849 --> 02:40:22.450]  He knew that.
[02:40:22.450 --> 02:40:24.811]  And so did our generals understand that.
[02:40:24.811 --> 02:40:33.415]  So what you're saying is you're saying Trump did work out this strategy and that he's not being a wild card with a statement about fire and fury and power.
[02:40:34.147 --> 02:40:34.627]  Correct.
[02:40:34.627 --> 02:40:46.712]  If you look at the art of the deal, you will see that Trump always looks to another person in order to put a... He'll look to A, but he wants pressure on B. So he's very clever.
[02:40:46.712 --> 02:40:51.174]  Putin has said it repeatedly, and those who work with Trump say it repeatedly.
[02:40:51.174 --> 02:40:56.016]  I have never met him personally, but I know his modus operandi.
[02:40:56.016 --> 02:40:57.777]  I see exactly how it works.
[02:40:57.777 --> 02:40:58.838]  I understand how it works.
[02:40:58.838 --> 02:41:01.699]  So here's the next question, and I've got to go to phone calls, because they want to talk to you and Adam.
[02:41:02.728 --> 02:41:07.469]  And I'm going to skip this next break coming up so we have more time here, but you did call.
[02:41:07.469 --> 02:41:14.312]  In fact, it gives me a headache trying to, all the times you did, a couple years ago, a few months ago, a few weeks ago, you were like, Alex, don't worry about North Korea.
[02:41:14.312 --> 02:41:18.653]  It's all a bunch of saber rattling, you know, as a pretext for the forces to be there encircling China.
[02:41:18.653 --> 02:41:21.754]  And if they keep going, we're going to have India, you know, destabilize them.
[02:41:21.754 --> 02:41:22.974]  And that's what this deal's about.
[02:41:22.974 --> 02:41:24.455]  Well, clearly that's what's happened.
[02:41:24.455 --> 02:41:25.475]  So what comes next?
[02:41:25.475 --> 02:41:26.655]  What do you expect China to do?
[02:41:26.655 --> 02:41:26.915]  Really?
[02:41:26.915 --> 02:41:28.196]  Well, here's a question I have.
[02:41:28.196 --> 02:41:31.917]  So I know that, you know, Uncle Don can't even get an op-ed in the New York Times anymore.
[02:41:31.977 --> 02:41:36.078]  He used to, you know, if he wrote something they'd be like, we'll take it, almost sight unseen.
[02:41:36.078 --> 02:41:43.380]  He finally wound up recently with kind of like an interview in Newsweek of all things, like that's not really that relevant anymore.
[02:41:43.380 --> 02:41:54.502]  And he's, right off the top he says, North Korea is not suicidal, they're not going to attack us, they just want to be seen as a player, they just want, you know, real truce, not armistice and all this crap.
[02:41:54.502 --> 02:42:00.004]  But why is it, in your opinion, this being, you know, the information wars, why
[02:42:01.104 --> 02:42:09.833]  Does the New York Times not see the simple fact, we were just, before you came on, we were talking about look at China, look at India, not on the brink of nuclear war.
[02:42:09.833 --> 02:42:14.018]  Why, is this because they're instructed to do so or are they just stupid?
[02:42:14.938 --> 02:42:19.501]  No, Adam, it gets to a very basic point that you just pointed out.
[02:42:19.501 --> 02:42:20.922]  They're not Don Greggs.
[02:42:20.922 --> 02:42:26.366]  They're not any of the guys who were trained in national security and intelligence.
[02:42:26.366 --> 02:42:28.747]  The New York Times is stupid.
[02:42:28.747 --> 02:42:30.148]  I mean, as simple as that.
[02:42:30.148 --> 02:42:35.452]  Aren't they worried just about trying to stay relevant and attacking any independent media they don't control?
[02:42:35.452 --> 02:42:37.113]  Well, they run on sources.
[02:42:37.113 --> 02:42:39.755]  They run on sources and whatever their sources are, they print them.
[02:42:44.938 --> 02:42:47.480]  It's easy in the New York Times.
[02:42:47.480 --> 02:42:49.421]  The day of the source is over.
[02:42:49.421 --> 02:42:51.322]  The day of the Twitter has come about.
[02:42:51.322 --> 02:42:53.563]  The New York Times is not relevant.
[02:42:53.563 --> 02:42:57.025]  You have millions of dollars that's going down the drain in the New York Times.
[02:42:57.025 --> 02:42:58.927]  The Washington Post... So let's talk about Twitter.
[02:42:58.927 --> 02:42:59.647]  You come on.
[02:42:59.647 --> 02:43:01.848]  You get thousands of tweets bullying you.
[02:43:01.848 --> 02:43:02.809]  What are you doing?
[02:43:02.809 --> 02:43:03.809]  Don't go on Alex Jones.
[02:43:03.809 --> 02:43:05.070]  We're gonna not like you.
[02:43:05.070 --> 02:43:06.311]  And then most of it's bots.
[02:43:06.311 --> 02:43:07.772]  And all they do is try to bully
[02:43:08.272 --> 02:43:17.535]  Like, like, like they're stopping Infowars, or like they're stopping you when you're relevant, not being right-wing, not being left-wing, Adam Curry, but just on having a real discussion.
[02:43:17.535 --> 02:43:19.996]  I mean, this is not right-wing, it's not left-wing.
[02:43:19.996 --> 02:43:21.136]  Well, twofold.
[02:43:21.136 --> 02:43:31.079]  One is, all people have bias, and as we talked earlier, I think that people have actual forms of brain damage after the loss of the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton.
[02:43:31.499 --> 02:43:32.600]  It was such a shock.
[02:43:32.600 --> 02:43:34.361]  It was a actual shock.
[02:43:34.361 --> 02:43:34.581]  PTSD!
[02:43:34.581 --> 02:43:38.143]  I mean, up until, you know, midnight.
[02:43:38.143 --> 02:43:39.863]  It's like, 95% she's going to win.
[02:43:39.863 --> 02:43:42.985]  That's a shock if you think you're going to win the Academy Award and you don't win.
[02:43:42.985 --> 02:43:49.268]  Especially when they're such snowflakes and they've invested their whole identity, like Sauron, into the ring, into Hillary.
[02:43:49.268 --> 02:43:51.129]  The ring gets thrown into the lava pit.
[02:43:52.150 --> 02:44:08.495]  Well, that doesn't matter that much to me, because, you know, people support whoever they want to support, but the media so mistreated the information, that shock came, so now people will just see, oh, InfoWars, hey, it must be, oh, he's crazy, he must be nuts, oh, oh, the propaganda, oh, what are you doing?
[02:44:08.495 --> 02:44:10.676]  Literally, literally like that.
[02:44:12.056 --> 02:44:14.078]  But you see the quality of guests you have on here.
[02:44:14.078 --> 02:44:16.240]  This is really, this is really fantastic.
[02:44:16.240 --> 02:44:18.602]  But the difference is the mainstream media doesn't want real guests on.
[02:44:18.602 --> 02:44:21.825]  They just want to have talking heads, like, we're going to pre-interview now.
[02:44:21.825 --> 02:44:23.486]  What are you going to talk about, Pachenik?
[02:44:23.486 --> 02:44:24.907]  Curry, what are you going to talk about?
[02:44:24.907 --> 02:44:27.209]  I want to know first or I'm not letting you on.
[02:44:27.209 --> 02:44:29.131]  Can we even talk before you came on?
[02:44:29.131 --> 02:44:29.491]  No, sir.
[02:44:29.491 --> 02:44:30.252]  Just walk in.
[02:44:30.252 --> 02:44:31.113]  Here you go.
[02:44:31.113 --> 02:44:39.740]  Yeah, but you see, one of the reasons why I come on, guys, it's because we all have a sense of humor and a sense of proportion about ourselves.
[02:44:40.180 --> 02:44:46.544]  The reason I adored your uncle and some of his colleagues was the fact he would always kid about himself.
[02:44:46.544 --> 02:44:52.607]  And, you know, if I was down in the garage, he'd say to me, did you check underneath your car?
[02:44:52.607 --> 02:44:56.190]  Which was another way of saying, oh, maybe somebody put a bomb there.
[02:44:56.190 --> 02:44:57.510]  How nice!
[02:44:57.510 --> 02:45:03.034]  I mean, he had a great sense of humor, even when he reprimanded me, and it had to do with Panama and all.
[02:45:03.034 --> 02:45:04.354]  I said, you're right.
[02:45:04.354 --> 02:45:05.435]  You're absolutely right.
[02:45:05.435 --> 02:45:08.257]  But you see... Did you know Felix Rodriguez and all those guys?
[02:45:09.346 --> 02:45:12.289]  Well, I don't want to get into it.
[02:45:12.289 --> 02:45:16.273]  He's the only one who could call me back, and he was the only one I listened to.
[02:45:16.273 --> 02:45:17.955]  But you got to understand one thing.
[02:45:17.955 --> 02:45:25.803]  Don Greggs of the world and those of us who were trained in the 70s and 60s and 80s, we were trained by MIT.
[02:45:25.803 --> 02:45:27.926]  We were trained by a national character.
[02:45:27.926 --> 02:45:30.008]  Don Gregg knows national character.
[02:45:30.008 --> 02:45:30.869]  He knows strategy.
[02:45:30.869 --> 02:45:31.830]  He knows tactics.
[02:45:32.330 --> 02:45:35.175]  And I'm not sure we have that anymore in the intelligence community.
[02:45:35.175 --> 02:45:38.220]  And he could not get into the White House when Obama was there.
[02:45:38.220 --> 02:45:39.702]  They would not let him in.
[02:45:39.702 --> 02:45:46.092]  You got people in suits with swipe cards who actually watch movies and think they're like secret agents.
[02:45:47.014 --> 02:45:47.394]  I guess.
[02:45:47.394 --> 02:45:49.596]  I mean, he tried to get a meeting.
[02:45:49.596 --> 02:45:52.538]  He said, look, and he actually was Republican.
[02:45:52.538 --> 02:45:54.479]  He voted for Obama twice.
[02:45:54.479 --> 02:45:56.761]  And he said, you know, I have some standing.
[02:45:56.761 --> 02:45:58.462]  I've been there in the past couple of years.
[02:45:58.462 --> 02:45:59.662]  Here's what we need to do.
[02:45:59.662 --> 02:46:04.045]  They let him in, had some flunky talk to him, and 30 minutes later, he was out the back door.
[02:46:04.045 --> 02:46:04.446]  No meeting.
[02:46:18.495 --> 02:46:33.681]  And that's why they're all freaking out, because the edifice realizes it lost, so now it's got to prove that it can come back, or it's going to be defunded.
[02:46:33.681 --> 02:46:39.863]  So they're all fighting for their lives, but they don't get, even if they defeat Trump, it's Pyrrhic, they're gone, they're done.
[02:46:40.163 --> 02:46:44.244]  And I'm not just saying give up like propaganda to the globalists, they're done.
[02:46:44.244 --> 02:46:46.345]  Your system doesn't work, people are sick of it.
[02:46:46.345 --> 02:46:50.306]  Let's go to Paul in Virginia, then we'll go to Alex, Bill, Kevin, and Max.
[02:46:50.306 --> 02:46:51.726]  Thanks for holding, guys.
[02:46:51.726 --> 02:46:52.826]  Let's go to Paul in Virginia.
[02:46:52.826 --> 02:46:55.427]  You're on the air worldwide, Paul.
[02:46:55.427 --> 02:46:56.887]  Amazing discussion.
[02:46:56.887 --> 02:47:06.970]  I've been listening to it bitterly on the edge of my seat as I see it, and I used to work for Mr. Kissinger himself when I was in the Navy.
[02:47:08.265 --> 02:47:10.887]  I see it very clearly as you have three options.
[02:47:10.887 --> 02:47:13.109]  Two are war options.
[02:47:13.109 --> 02:47:18.793]  Those two are assassinate them, make a deal with the people, assassinate them and replace them.
[02:47:18.793 --> 02:47:27.679]  The second one is a preemptive nuclear strike with 40 to 50 tactical weapons and five city blockbusters.
[02:47:27.679 --> 02:47:35.545]  But that requires deep raids of 600 plus people into the country to secure the nuclear stockpile.
[02:47:36.394 --> 02:47:47.640]  And then you're looking at a 300,000, 400,000 troop excursion across the border to surround the DMZ and cut off all those troops.
[02:47:47.640 --> 02:47:49.381]  Both those options are unrealistic.
[02:47:49.381 --> 02:47:56.184]  I think you've got to, if you're going to actually have a military strike, you've got to go ahead and kill everybody in the DMZ with nuclear weapons.
[02:47:56.184 --> 02:48:05.949]  And I don't want this to happen, but if you're going to hit North Korea, you've got to pretty much destroy, or would a decapitation, if it went that way, Dr. Pachenik, in your view, work?
[02:48:07.287 --> 02:48:10.591]  Well, the issue of decapitation is interesting.
[02:48:10.591 --> 02:48:14.935]  I mean, that's always been what we call a scenario that's been up there.
[02:48:14.935 --> 02:48:22.303]  But one of the reasons why Kim Jong-un is nervous and keeps on pushing the buttons, as Don Gregg understands, is
[02:48:22.363 --> 02:48:22.844]  Very well.
[02:48:40.863 --> 02:48:43.745]  One in North Korea, but more importantly in China.
[02:48:43.745 --> 02:48:50.128]  We can decapitate them in terms of taking them out tactically, not strategically.
[02:48:50.128 --> 02:48:52.349]  I told you, the borders are too close.
[02:48:52.349 --> 02:48:55.331]  DMZ is 30 miles away from Seoul.
[02:48:55.331 --> 02:48:58.192]  Any attack would totally obliterate Seoul.
[02:48:58.192 --> 02:48:59.993]  We're talking about millions of people.
[02:48:59.993 --> 02:49:02.594]  I just don't see it happening at all, at all, at all.
[02:49:02.594 --> 02:49:09.278]  I'm saying if you do it, you have to wipe all those troops out because they've all got dead man switches to attack if they don't get orders.
[02:49:10.003 --> 02:49:15.288]  No, what the gentleman I think was referring to is a specific assassination.
[02:49:15.288 --> 02:49:16.850]  That's why I brought up decapitation, yeah.
[02:49:17.799 --> 02:49:22.621]  Yeah, but in reality, it sounds easier than it is.
[02:49:22.621 --> 02:49:26.603]  It's not a complicated process, but I don't want to get into it here.
[02:49:26.603 --> 02:49:37.028]  The truth of the matter is that Kim Jong-un wants to remain as part of the familial heritage to maintain power, and he will give away a lot in order to remain in power.
[02:49:37.028 --> 02:49:40.010]  But he knows one thing, and Don Gregg always knew this,
[02:49:40.570 --> 02:49:45.674]  That if we took away the atomic bomb from Saddam Hussein or any weapons, then we took him out.
[02:49:45.674 --> 02:49:48.156]  We took out Qaddafi, gave us the weapons.
[02:49:48.156 --> 02:49:51.658]  He knows that if he has weapons and missiles, then he's a player and gets left alone.
[02:49:51.658 --> 02:49:52.098]  Correct.
[02:49:52.098 --> 02:49:53.119]  And he gets left alone.
[02:49:53.119 --> 02:49:54.740]  It's his insurance policy.
[02:49:54.740 --> 02:49:55.861]  It doesn't really work.
[02:49:55.861 --> 02:49:59.384]  I mean, the missiles aren't all that great and he's not going to go to war.
[02:49:59.384 --> 02:50:03.887]  But he has to have some kind of assurance that he will remain in power so that at least
[02:50:04.187 --> 02:50:04.567]  Exactly.
[02:50:04.567 --> 02:50:12.615]  Paul, real quick, getting a decapitation, are you saying you think it would be good to decapitate the North Korean leadership?
[02:50:12.615 --> 02:50:13.936]  Well, no.
[02:50:13.936 --> 02:50:17.599]  You've got to do it with a deal with the North Korean leadership.
[02:50:17.599 --> 02:50:20.562]  I don't think we know enough people in North Korea.
[02:50:20.562 --> 02:50:22.704]  If you make the deal with
[02:50:23.160 --> 02:50:26.943]  The underlings underneath him to kill him, that's the deal.
[02:50:26.943 --> 02:50:28.283]  That's the decapitation.
[02:50:28.283 --> 02:50:28.924]  That's the only one.
[02:50:28.924 --> 02:50:29.904]  Well, take over of them.
[02:50:29.904 --> 02:50:37.830]  Actually, getting people that wanted to work with the West would be better unless you want to keep selling weapons and using North Korea as a chess piece.
[02:50:38.650 --> 02:50:55.678]  I don't know if you heard earlier, but Don was telling me, he said, look, what is going on in this axis of evil, especially with North Korea, for the longest time is, time for a sales call, gotta sell some gear over there to install to watch China, and to just sell some $40 billion worth of gear!
[02:50:55.678 --> 02:50:57.279]  It's the military-industrial complex.
[02:50:57.279 --> 02:50:58.660]  He said that very clearly to me.
[02:50:59.680 --> 02:51:01.642]  It's all theater.
[02:51:01.642 --> 02:51:07.707]  This, to me, is just more of the same, and definitely, as you point out, towards China.
[02:51:07.707 --> 02:51:20.377]  And what I think may be happening is, if we can present a deal to Kim Jong-un, which would be, you know, like Hong Kong, reunification in 50 years or 90 years, you'll be the guy that did it.
[02:51:20.377 --> 02:51:24.941]  We'll totally give you all the props and honors, but you've got to get rid of the nuclear arsenal.
[02:51:25.957 --> 02:51:30.923]  Maybe you want to be our ambassador to Korea and North Korea.
[02:51:30.923 --> 02:51:33.426]  Your lineage is very strong.
[02:51:33.426 --> 02:51:35.289]  I think Adam has the right idea.
[02:51:35.289 --> 02:51:37.211]  It's not a complicated situation.
[02:51:37.211 --> 02:51:38.192]  But here's the difference then.
[02:51:38.192 --> 02:51:42.738]  What's so threatening about this broadcast or others like it that the media lies about it?
[02:51:43.078 --> 02:52:01.080]  But all we're doing is having a real discussion about the real players, the real history, the real facts, because they want a dumbed-down message to have our own ruling elite that rule over a bunch of idiots in this country, and that's what InfoWars is about, is getting people behind the curtain to see the real debates that are actually going on.
[02:52:01.080 --> 02:52:01.840]  Paul, anything else?
[02:52:03.254 --> 02:52:12.980]  Yeah, the real option that you have, the only one that's viable, and you'll know when it happens, is to boycott China.
[02:52:12.980 --> 02:52:17.943]  If you boycott China, within 30 days the communist government's finished.
[02:52:19.716 --> 02:52:22.178]  Well, it sounds easier than it is.
[02:52:22.178 --> 02:52:39.148]  The reality is we do have economic pressure, but what we are doing, and I can't speak on behalf of this administration, but it's been done before, and that is the intelligence community and the military communities running what we call a financial war.
[02:52:39.148 --> 02:52:40.668]  Same thing we did with Iran.
[02:52:40.668 --> 02:52:42.990]  They're basically cutting into China's
[02:52:43.630 --> 02:52:47.213]  Assistance to North Korea, and Paul is correct.
[02:52:47.213 --> 02:52:58.862]  We are running an economic war right now, but we're hitting the specific... But has China... Has China... Well, and thank you, caller, thank you, Paul, I got other callers, but just briefly to both of you.
[02:52:58.862 --> 02:53:05.827]  Why are the sectors of the elites, Hollywood, the globalist faction, fighting for their lives against Trump?
[02:53:05.827 --> 02:53:11.591]  When you look at what he's doing, it's like a standard Americana stability, prosperity system.
[02:53:11.591 --> 02:53:12.472]  I think I can answer that.
[02:53:13.272 --> 02:53:18.215]  Almost 700 billion dollars a year of our economy is the military-industrial complex.
[02:53:18.215 --> 02:53:23.578]  People are slowly starting to figure out, we have 400, 500 bases, you know, what exactly is all this?
[02:53:23.578 --> 02:53:24.999]  What is all this money going to?
[02:53:24.999 --> 02:53:31.162]  And I think that it does not behoove any of the existing systems for people to be really aware of all that.
[02:53:31.162 --> 02:53:35.345]  So it's, and I believe... Trump's crime is he wants to be pragmatic and work with Russia.
[02:53:35.905 --> 02:53:37.486]  Well, that's part of his crime.
[02:53:37.486 --> 02:53:43.608]  That changes the whole... And he also probably doesn't want to be killing people all the time to extract resources.
[02:53:43.608 --> 02:53:44.649]  I hope.
[02:53:44.649 --> 02:53:45.549]  I hope.
[02:53:45.549 --> 02:53:47.830]  Dr. Pucinich, what is his great crime?
[02:53:47.830 --> 02:53:48.791]  Then we're going to go back to calls.
[02:53:48.791 --> 02:53:50.431]  I mean, why are they so angry at Trump?
[02:53:50.431 --> 02:53:51.012]  Because it's like...
[02:53:52.012 --> 02:53:53.413]  It's not about Trump, really.
[02:53:53.413 --> 02:53:55.174]  It's what I said a long time ago.
[02:53:55.174 --> 02:53:56.956]  They failed miserably.
[02:53:56.956 --> 02:53:58.116]  It's what Adam said.
[02:53:58.116 --> 02:53:59.817]  They had no, absolutely no leadership.
[02:53:59.817 --> 02:54:00.538]  So it's projection.
[02:54:00.538 --> 02:54:07.022]  They hate themselves, their mismanagers, their failures, their jokes, and so they hate winners.
[02:54:07.022 --> 02:54:10.885]  Well, it's basically a very simple psychology.
[02:54:10.885 --> 02:54:19.411]  They project it out so that we look like the enemies, when in fact, their deficiencies have compounded immensely, even since Hillary.
[02:54:19.949 --> 02:54:20.049]  Yes.
[02:54:35.387 --> 02:54:44.294]  Who could be the next chairman of the DNC, but they refused him and put a Hispanic in for Montgomery County who has never done anything.
[02:54:44.294 --> 02:54:47.197]  So the DNC is self-destructive.
[02:54:47.197 --> 02:54:55.263]  What's happening is you're the fly in the ointment that constantly is there and reminding them of their incompetency.
[02:54:55.263 --> 02:54:59.427]  And never forget the fact that you're still around and you came out of nowhere.
[02:55:00.027 --> 02:55:04.429]  And you have somebody like Adam or whoever else, that creates envy.
[02:55:04.429 --> 02:55:07.250]  Envy in the system is very disruptive.
[02:55:07.250 --> 02:55:11.132]  That means they have to destroy you and they want to destroy themselves.
[02:55:11.132 --> 02:55:17.175]  The reality is the more they keep hitting you or when they call you to court or when they did this or that, it doesn't matter.
[02:55:17.675 --> 02:55:22.198]  You become stronger, the community understands... And by the way, you're not just boosting me.
[02:55:22.198 --> 02:55:23.078]  This is for everybody.
[02:55:23.078 --> 02:55:23.859]  It's true.
[02:55:23.859 --> 02:55:26.700]  We get stronger, like Nietzsche said, when we survive these attacks.
[02:55:26.700 --> 02:55:30.202]  We literally got stronger when they tried to take my kids and destroy me.
[02:55:30.202 --> 02:55:33.684]  We literally get stronger when they do these demonization pieces.
[02:55:33.684 --> 02:55:37.106]  Which other commentator on the left ever said the word Nietzsche?
[02:55:38.546 --> 02:55:42.151]  I mean, that's my point.
[02:55:42.151 --> 02:55:50.401]  Who can at the same time use Nietzsche heuristic concepts and make jokes about rock and roll?
[02:55:50.401 --> 02:55:52.584]  Tell me one person other than yourself.
[02:55:53.996 --> 02:55:55.638]  I'm number two.
[02:55:55.638 --> 02:55:57.200]  Well, they all take themselves too serious.
[02:55:57.200 --> 02:55:58.762]  It's what you said at the beginning.
[02:55:58.762 --> 02:55:59.803]  They're not regular people.
[02:55:59.803 --> 02:56:00.804]  Well, that's the point.
[02:56:00.804 --> 02:56:02.006]  But you're unique.
[02:56:02.006 --> 02:56:02.907]  So is Adam.
[02:56:02.907 --> 02:56:06.952]  So am I. You know, the Don Greggs of the world understood what I was about.
[02:56:06.952 --> 02:56:11.177]  When I came out of MIT, they immediately came to me and said, let's work together.
[02:56:11.477 --> 02:56:13.039]  There was no ifs ands and buts.
[02:56:13.039 --> 02:56:17.425]  They didn't ask me about whether I care about their mothers and fathers as a psychiatrist.
[02:56:17.425 --> 02:56:23.512]  What they were interested in, what we were all interested in, was what's the strategy, what's the tactics, where do we go next?
[02:56:23.512 --> 02:56:25.315]  And Don Gregg is brilliant.
[02:56:29.660 --> 02:56:30.801]  I would love to have him on.
[02:56:30.801 --> 02:56:33.103]  I would definitely talk to him about it.
[02:56:33.103 --> 02:56:37.888]  He wrote a book, which you might find interesting, called Pot Shards, P-O-T, Pot Shards.
[02:56:37.888 --> 02:56:38.268]  Wow.
[02:56:38.268 --> 02:56:39.750]  And I'll definitely send you a copy.
[02:56:39.750 --> 02:56:40.310]  Well, it's interesting.
[02:56:40.310 --> 02:56:41.231]  We've got to go to more calls.
[02:56:41.231 --> 02:56:42.512]  Both of you, let's do five more minutes.
[02:56:42.512 --> 02:56:46.216]  I promise I'm going to go to Kevin's up next and others.
[02:56:46.216 --> 02:56:47.697]  I've got to plug some stuff, speaking of money.
[02:56:48.718 --> 02:56:50.459]  We're funded by the listeners and viewers.
[02:56:50.459 --> 02:56:52.480]  We want to make America and the whole planet great.
[02:56:52.480 --> 02:56:53.260]  We want prosperity.
[02:56:53.260 --> 02:56:56.401]  We want free, real, open societies, not Soros' system.
[02:56:56.401 --> 02:56:58.722]  And we're beginning to win, but we're under massive attack.
[02:56:58.722 --> 02:57:01.303]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:57:01.303 --> 02:57:07.966]  I've got a whole bunch of huge specials on air purification, water purification.
[02:57:07.966 --> 02:57:09.246]  It's not that we think we can have nuclear war.
[02:57:09.246 --> 02:57:11.367]  It's just the tap water's full of garbage, folks.
[02:57:11.367 --> 02:57:12.267]  We've got it all there.
[02:57:12.267 --> 02:57:13.228]  The Alexa PurePrub.
[02:57:14.306 --> 02:57:15.567]  Massively discounted.
[02:57:15.567 --> 02:57:16.728]  The Alexa Breeze Pro.
[02:57:16.728 --> 02:57:17.969]  Massively discounted.
[02:57:17.969 --> 02:57:18.649]  Competing units.
[02:57:18.649 --> 02:57:19.330]  Cost $400 to $600.
[02:57:19.330 --> 02:57:20.831]  They do the exact same thing.
[02:57:20.831 --> 02:57:21.271]  It's $149.
[02:57:21.271 --> 02:57:24.333]  And it runs almost silently.
[02:57:24.333 --> 02:57:26.295]  I've got them all over my house.
[02:57:26.295 --> 02:57:27.636]  What is this thing?
[02:57:27.636 --> 02:57:29.778]  It's a four-stage filtration system.
[02:57:29.778 --> 02:57:30.938]  Oh, because I have a HEPA filter?
[02:57:30.938 --> 02:57:32.419]  This filters the air.
[02:57:32.419 --> 02:57:32.920]  I need this.
[02:57:32.920 --> 02:57:34.401]  And it's even got the ion system.
[02:57:34.401 --> 02:57:38.324]  And the point is, is that everybody else is putting like five times markup.
[02:57:39.036 --> 02:57:39.216]  Right.
[02:58:00.905 --> 02:58:01.806]  No one's even close.
[02:58:01.806 --> 02:58:04.327]  At $2.49 what it normally is, it's insane.
[02:58:04.327 --> 02:58:06.029]  We normally discount at $1.99.
[02:58:06.029 --> 02:58:16.836]  So the Alexa Pure Breeze, InfowarsStore.com, or 888-253-3139, with all the particulate and garbage and things that's out there, you owe it to yourself and your children.
[02:58:16.836 --> 02:58:23.961]  We have a 1776 specials running in the month of July, but I've got to stop some of these because the products sell out and they come back in.
[02:58:23.961 --> 02:58:25.182]  Children's fluoride-free
[02:58:26.002 --> 02:58:30.905]  With Iodine and Coil Silver is back in of the Super Blue Toothpaste.
[02:58:30.905 --> 02:58:34.047]  We also have the Adult Type and Super Blue mouthwash now available.
[02:58:34.047 --> 02:58:37.330]  It's got Iodine and Coil Silver in it and is amazing.
[02:58:37.330 --> 02:58:39.431]  InfoWorksStore.com.
[02:58:39.431 --> 02:58:42.273]  33% off right now on the toothpaste.
[02:58:42.273 --> 02:58:42.533]  888-253-3139.
[02:58:42.533 --> 02:58:44.374]  Thanks for all your support.
[02:58:44.374 --> 02:58:47.316]  We'll be back in 70 seconds with your phone calls.
[02:58:47.316 --> 02:58:53.220]  And I'm going to go ahead and co-host with old Roger Stone because he didn't bring his microphone with him on the road.
[02:58:53.220 --> 02:58:54.621]  I tell you, I'm going to skin him alive.
[02:58:54.621 --> 02:58:55.582]  We'll be right back in 70 seconds.
[02:58:57.403 --> 02:58:58.864]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:58:58.864 --> 02:59:01.586]  Visit Infowarslife.com to secure your chemistry.

[02:59:46.639 --> 02:59:47.941]  That means it's clean.
[02:59:47.941 --> 02:59:49.202]  That means it's pure.
[02:59:49.202 --> 02:59:52.086]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[02:59:52.086 --> 02:59:54.889]  That's InfoWarsLives.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:59:54.889 --> 02:59:58.974]  Take action now before we sell out.
[02:59:58.974 --> 03:00:01.598]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:20.600 --> 03:00:24.224]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, taking your phone calls.
[03:00:24.224 --> 03:00:26.546]  I'm going to stay on with Roger Stone to get to all these calls.
[03:00:26.546 --> 03:00:29.489]  Roger's got big breaking news on Manafort Rated.
[03:00:29.489 --> 03:00:33.393]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:33.393 --> 03:00:34.474]  Yeah, I got to cut to the liners.
[03:00:34.474 --> 03:00:34.994]  They're good.
[03:00:34.994 --> 03:00:36.336]  You are the resistance.
[03:00:36.336 --> 03:00:38.938]  Have you noticed the Democrats have totally adopted the resistance and all that?
[03:00:38.938 --> 03:00:39.679]  Adopt stolen.
[03:00:41.161 --> 03:00:41.981]  Resist we much?
[03:00:41.981 --> 03:00:43.923]  That is the most sincere form of flattery.
[03:00:43.923 --> 03:00:44.904]  True, true.
[03:00:44.904 --> 03:00:45.324]  I love it.
[03:00:45.324 --> 03:00:47.746]  The Sean Hannity Show is now the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:47.746 --> 03:00:54.432]  But I don't even want to say that because I want to concede that's true victory when you're being, it's not plagiarized, it's the truth, it's being magnified.
[03:00:54.432 --> 03:00:58.196]  That means they won't kill me probably because now the transmission's already been sent.
[03:00:58.196 --> 03:00:59.577]  See, I've already done my mission.
[03:00:59.577 --> 03:01:02.940]  Why blow up the missile launcher when the ICBM's already, you know...
[03:01:03.280 --> 03:01:03.901]  Gone into orbit.
[03:01:03.901 --> 03:01:05.202]  Man, they're not going to kill you.
[03:01:05.202 --> 03:01:06.202]  They need you.
[03:01:06.202 --> 03:01:07.423]  You're necessary.
[03:01:07.423 --> 03:01:09.325]  Necessary in the whole machine.
[03:01:09.325 --> 03:01:10.026]  I don't know about that.
[03:01:10.026 --> 03:01:11.207]  They're really getting pissed off at me.
[03:01:11.207 --> 03:01:12.388]  The leftists are.
[03:01:12.388 --> 03:01:13.168]  He's agreeing with me.
[03:01:13.168 --> 03:01:13.488]  I know.
[03:01:13.488 --> 03:01:13.689]  I know.
[03:01:13.689 --> 03:01:14.809]  The doctor knows what's up.
[03:01:14.809 --> 03:01:15.230]  We'll see.
[03:01:15.230 --> 03:01:17.452]  They're trying to wind up crazies to kill us all.
[03:01:17.452 --> 03:01:19.233]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:01:19.233 --> 03:01:19.874]  We're necessary.
[03:01:19.874 --> 03:01:20.574]  They keep us around.
[03:01:20.574 --> 03:01:21.415]  It's important.
[03:01:21.415 --> 03:01:22.316]  You need someone to hate.
[03:01:23.342 --> 03:01:24.422]  Oh, you think it's that?
[03:01:24.422 --> 03:01:25.083]  Totally!
[03:01:25.083 --> 03:01:28.184]  You need some kind of opposition that can be marginalized and spat upon.
[03:01:28.184 --> 03:01:28.804]  Exactly!
[03:01:28.804 --> 03:01:29.585]  Kevin!
[03:01:29.585 --> 03:01:32.286]  They don't get they're so hated as they spit on us.
[03:01:32.286 --> 03:01:33.186]  It's like laurels.
[03:01:33.186 --> 03:01:35.027]  It's like the rose petals.
[03:01:35.027 --> 03:01:39.208]  And believe me, this information war stuff, this is what's been going on.
[03:01:39.208 --> 03:01:42.670]  CIA is more in that than any covert killing crap.
[03:01:42.670 --> 03:01:44.651]  It's all about manipulation.
[03:01:44.651 --> 03:01:45.231]  It used to be
[03:01:45.811 --> 03:01:51.315]  You see what happened is you blew apart the entire system and that was part of what I
[03:02:05.424 --> 03:02:06.685]  That's an accurate statement?
[03:02:32.304 --> 03:02:37.249]  Well, you've got to understand, in our world, or my world, the elite is Don Gregg.
[03:02:37.249 --> 03:02:39.091]  It's not the New York Times.
[03:02:39.091 --> 03:02:43.755]  The elite are the people who worked with Don Gregg and others, and I'm not going to mention them.
[03:02:43.755 --> 03:02:46.518]  But that is the elite that was the elite.
[03:02:46.518 --> 03:02:48.660]  They were part of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[03:02:48.660 --> 03:02:50.722]  Some of us left, as I did.
[03:02:50.722 --> 03:02:51.503]  Some remained.
[03:02:51.503 --> 03:02:55.787]  But the real elite has never been part of the New York Times or the Washington Post.
[03:02:56.467 --> 03:03:03.433]  Adam can tell you, when did David Ignatius of the Washington Post ever call up Don Gregg for information recently?
[03:03:03.433 --> 03:03:04.374]  Never.
[03:03:04.374 --> 03:03:06.075]  Because they don't want more truth.
[03:03:06.075 --> 03:03:10.239]  They want to regurgitate what some think tank or elitist wanted.
[03:03:10.239 --> 03:03:10.619]  Kevin?
[03:03:10.619 --> 03:03:15.543]  Well, they're basically much more sycophants than that, and they're opportunists.
[03:03:15.543 --> 03:03:19.987]  And the problem is, if Don Gregg is not relevant today, which he is to me,
[03:03:20.667 --> 03:03:24.770]  Sure, but the point is they don't want to know what North Korea really is.
[03:03:24.770 --> 03:03:26.251]  They just want to make something up.
[03:03:37.978 --> 03:03:41.461]  Well, if it bleeds... Which, if they put that out, it becomes more of a fantasy land and becomes dangerous.
[03:03:41.461 --> 03:03:42.542]  If it bleeds, it leads.
[03:03:42.542 --> 03:03:45.625]  It's much better for ratings, and that is the bottom line.
[03:03:45.625 --> 03:03:46.886]  The bottom line.
[03:03:46.886 --> 03:03:48.608]  It is much better for ratings to scare people.
[03:03:48.608 --> 03:03:49.268]  Well, I'll admit it, too.
[03:03:49.268 --> 03:03:54.053]  I mean, when they're talking about nuking and the President saying, fire and fury, I'm gonna come running around here, stay around the house.
[03:03:54.053 --> 03:03:56.215]  I mean, you know, like a chicken, you know.
[03:03:57.135 --> 03:03:57.676]  That's what happened.
[03:03:57.676 --> 03:03:58.557]  We love you for that.
[03:03:58.557 --> 03:04:00.038]  You guys are worse than I am.
[03:04:00.038 --> 03:04:02.420]  For 25 years I've been building babies and cows!
[03:04:02.420 --> 03:04:03.541]  Yeah.
[03:04:03.541 --> 03:04:05.303]  And you were right!
[03:04:05.303 --> 03:04:06.644]  That's the crazy part.
[03:04:06.644 --> 03:04:07.185]  It said it.
[03:04:07.185 --> 03:04:09.747]  It was like in the BBC 20 years ago.
[03:04:09.747 --> 03:04:14.292]  For at least 20 years they've had humans chastating in embryonic form inside bovine.
[03:04:14.292 --> 03:04:16.093]  And then I'm reading it, I mean.
[03:04:16.093 --> 03:04:18.496]  Yeah, you know.
[03:04:18.496 --> 03:04:19.817]  But I wasn't a trailblazer.
[03:04:19.817 --> 03:04:20.497]  They were doing it.
[03:04:21.830 --> 03:04:23.333]  Gay frogs?
[03:04:23.333 --> 03:04:24.235]  Yes, gay frogs.
[03:04:24.235 --> 03:04:25.357]  The WB frog?
[03:04:25.357 --> 03:04:27.160]  Yeah, well that's Atrazine.
[03:04:27.160 --> 03:04:28.362]  Atrazine is a real issue.
[03:04:28.362 --> 03:04:31.006]  It's not being discussed at all.
[03:04:31.006 --> 03:04:32.048]  He's just laughing.
[03:04:32.048 --> 03:04:33.711]  He's like, I can't believe I'm alive!
[03:04:34.850 --> 03:04:38.055]  What's funny is, actually, you hit on a soft spot right now.
[03:04:38.055 --> 03:04:40.879]  There's this whole new genetic editing called CRISPR.
[03:04:40.879 --> 03:04:43.062]  Oh, yeah.
[03:04:43.062 --> 03:04:46.006]  So, in effect, you know, we're all in the same boat.
[03:04:46.006 --> 03:04:51.333]  Unicorns didn't exist, but we could engineer a baby now with a big pink unicorn horn.
[03:04:52.065 --> 03:04:52.625]  Yeah, you got it.
[03:04:52.625 --> 03:04:54.866]  You could probably even engineer him to crap Skittles.
[03:04:54.866 --> 03:04:58.328]  Hey, Dr. Steve Pachenik!
[03:04:58.328 --> 03:05:03.370]  Hey, we're gonna come right back with Roger Stone, Adam Curry, amazing, thank you so much.
[03:05:03.370 --> 03:05:03.850]  Thank you very much.
[03:05:03.850 --> 03:05:05.391]  Nice to meet you, Steve.
[03:05:05.391 --> 03:05:05.851]  Crazy show.
[03:05:07.279 --> 03:05:11.041]  What exactly is political correctness, and why is it being pushed on the American public?
[03:05:11.041 --> 03:05:17.224]  Well, political correctness is simply a form of psychological manipulation the government uses to control public opinion.
[03:05:17.224 --> 03:05:26.148]  By controlling your opinions, the establishment gets you to not only agree with their agenda, but to also ensure that your government-created viewpoint also influences others in ripple effect.
[03:05:26.388 --> 03:05:28.829]  This is how the power elite and the government stay in power.
[03:05:28.829 --> 03:05:32.671]  They use psychological manipulation to turn the public into obedient sheeple.
[03:05:32.671 --> 03:05:36.373]  And over time, we lose our ability to distinguish reality from deception.
[03:05:36.373 --> 03:05:39.755]  But how does political correctness and other deliberate deceptions work?
[03:05:39.755 --> 03:05:48.319]  Well, first, the establishment saturates mass media with their agenda they're trying to push until it invades every aspect of popular culture and is accepted as truth.
[03:05:48.319 --> 03:05:49.780]  Such as global warming, for example.
[03:05:49.980 --> 03:05:59.165]  Then the establishment suppresses any counter-arguments to their agenda by calling critics kooky, nutjobs, racists, or, in the case of man-made climate change, climate deniers.
[03:05:59.165 --> 03:06:05.669]  You can learn more about this tyranny over the minds of men at InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and our YouTube channel, Resistance News.
[03:06:05.669 --> 03:06:06.850]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[03:06:08.428 --> 03:06:12.209]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[03:06:12.209 --> 03:06:19.950]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[03:06:19.950 --> 03:06:28.572]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[03:06:28.572 --> 03:06:32.573]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[03:06:33.073 --> 03:06:42.798]  Our pathogen's added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[03:06:42.798 --> 03:06:46.220]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[03:06:46.220 --> 03:06:57.266]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[03:06:57.346 --> 03:07:00.248]  Discover why Anthroplex is turning so many heads today.
[03:07:00.248 --> 03:07:03.350]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands.
[03:07:03.350 --> 03:07:07.172]  And it starts at Infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[03:07:07.172 --> 03:07:10.194]  They use their media to assassinate Real News.
[03:07:10.194 --> 03:07:14.397]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[03:07:14.397 --> 03:07:21.101]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[03:07:21.101 --> 03:07:24.864]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[03:07:25.564 --> 03:07:45.052]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding, until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[03:07:45.612 --> 03:07:49.736]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[03:07:49.736 --> 03:08:00.966]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom, is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[03:08:00.966 --> 03:08:06.091]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm freedom's safest place.
[03:08:13.192 --> 03:08:21.706]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:08:51.350 --> 03:09:02.715]  Between the time of the fall of the witch Queen Hillary, and the rise of the anti-globalist movement, there was a time of great adventure.
[03:09:02.715 --> 03:09:04.236]  I alone am your chronicler.
[03:09:05.287 --> 03:09:07.469]  It's kind of a rip-off of the Conan the Barbarian intro.
[03:09:07.469 --> 03:09:09.751]  I'm cutting one for David Knight.
[03:09:09.751 --> 03:09:18.318]  It's kind of a comedy piece, but fun for his new show he's launching, where it starts like that, between the time of the fall of Hillary.
[03:09:18.318 --> 03:09:20.920]  No, no, I was writing it yesterday, I'm gonna voice it today.
[03:09:20.920 --> 03:09:30.668]  It was more like, between the defeat of the Witch Queen Hillary, and the fall of the New World Order, there was a time of great adventure.
[03:09:30.668 --> 03:09:32.229]  And then it comes in with the big, uh,
[03:09:34.105 --> 03:09:36.287]  Anvil of Krom music you just heard.
[03:09:36.287 --> 03:09:39.929]  Kind of a side issue, but that is coming up.
[03:09:39.929 --> 03:09:43.972]  What's the launch date of David Knight's new broadcast?
[03:09:43.972 --> 03:09:46.914]  It's the 21st.
[03:09:46.914 --> 03:09:49.555]  August 21st, 2017.
[03:09:49.555 --> 03:09:51.877]  Real News with David Knight.
[03:09:51.877 --> 03:09:54.278]  And folks are saying, are you still going to call it Real News?
[03:09:54.278 --> 03:09:56.220]  President Trump's launched his new thing called Real News.
[03:09:57.116 --> 03:09:58.977]  Yes, the two don't compete with each other.
[03:09:58.977 --> 03:10:01.198]  One is an hourly boil-down.
[03:10:01.198 --> 03:10:07.842]  Ours is a week-morning, three-hour transmission of talk radio, and we launched it first.
[03:10:07.842 --> 03:10:09.603]  Is the president plagiarizing us?
[03:10:09.603 --> 03:10:10.304]  No.
[03:10:10.304 --> 03:10:15.467]  If the CNN is fake news, we're launching something called the real news.
[03:10:17.011 --> 03:10:22.875]  And I know that most of our audience understands that, but some people territorialize things a little too much.
[03:10:22.875 --> 03:10:30.380]  And I get territorialism with women and things like that, but I do not get territorialism when it comes to ideas.
[03:10:30.380 --> 03:10:35.163]  I want my ideas taken when it's by the patriots.
[03:10:35.163 --> 03:10:37.685]  I don't like the plagiarism of the left.
[03:10:37.685 --> 03:10:41.628]  And Roger Stone has had CNN and all the rest of them take what he says and invert it.
[03:10:42.571 --> 03:10:46.334]  We have had them call themselves the Resistance now everywhere.
[03:10:46.334 --> 03:10:47.354]  We've got so much to cover.
[03:10:47.354 --> 03:10:52.418]  Manafort, SWAT team raided, the North Korea situation, and then he's got a guest coming up.
[03:10:52.418 --> 03:10:58.962]  But I promise, that's why I stayed over in his time, we're going to go to Kevin and Max and Bill and Josh and Alex in about two minutes.
[03:10:58.962 --> 03:11:01.103]  But Roger Stone, tell us what's coming up.
[03:11:01.103 --> 03:11:09.109]  And speaking of people stealing information, that's what MSM has done to us in their desperateness, but it's not working.
[03:11:11.398 --> 03:11:26.487]  Alex, in the second half hour, we're going to analyze the President's decision yesterday to endorse Senator Luther Strange in the special election in Alabama for the seat of Jeff Sessions.
[03:11:26.487 --> 03:11:37.974]  The reason this is important is because the President has unfortunately folded to pressure from Mitch McConnell and is supporting a candidate who does not support the Trump agenda.
[03:11:38.704 --> 03:11:46.568]  I view this as a golden opportunity to demonstrate that the President's prepared to punish his Republican opponents.
[03:11:46.568 --> 03:11:53.392]  But unfortunately, General Kelly and others have got the President to go along to get along.
[03:11:53.392 --> 03:11:56.714]  We'll get into this in the second half hour.
[03:11:56.714 --> 03:12:00.516]  The big news today, of course, is the Manafort raid.
[03:12:00.516 --> 03:12:02.977]  I have now conferred with Manafort's attorneys.
[03:12:04.130 --> 03:12:11.464]  I have confirmed that all of the records that were obtained were never requested by Mueller's office.
[03:12:11.464 --> 03:12:14.751]  They were all mundane, mostly public documents.
[03:12:15.402 --> 03:12:22.787]  Bank records could certainly have been obtained by Mueller from the bank with a subpoena.
[03:12:22.787 --> 03:12:27.550]  So this is a kangaroo court style show process.
[03:12:27.550 --> 03:12:45.142]  And as I said earlier, I think they're trying to distract from the fact that Jeff Sessions may finally have woken up and appears to be on the trail of Bill and Hillary Clinton and the corruption at the Clinton Foundation because attorneys from the Southern District in New York
[03:12:46.162 --> 03:12:46.603]  Wow.
[03:12:46.603 --> 03:13:01.191]  Flesh that out more for us, because obviously you're the former business partner in your lobbying firm with Manafort.
[03:13:01.191 --> 03:13:02.371]  Manafort and Stone.
[03:13:02.371 --> 03:13:03.772]  Stone and Manafort.
[03:13:03.772 --> 03:13:12.877]  And he was the campaign chairman after Lewandowski took over from you, which I guess he was the third campaign manager.
[03:13:14.838 --> 03:13:19.081]  Pure optics, obviously they admit they've run cold on their whole Russian narrative.
[03:13:19.081 --> 03:13:24.906]  You've said many times when you've been subpoenaed by these same people, you send nothing because there is nothing.
[03:13:24.906 --> 03:13:32.351]  They're talking about in Reuters and places, but me being subpoenaed, I mean, there's literally about my Russian funding.
[03:13:32.351 --> 03:13:37.355]  I mean, it's like saying, they're going to subpoena me about the leprechaun I've got living in my basement.
[03:13:37.355 --> 03:13:40.097]  I mean, it's just, there is no Russian connection.
[03:13:40.097 --> 03:13:42.579]  There's zero, zero, zero.
[03:13:44.791 --> 03:13:46.192]  That's exactly right, Alex.
[03:13:46.192 --> 03:13:48.114]  Look, this is really quite simple.
[03:13:48.114 --> 03:14:01.384]  Paul Manafort represented a political party in the Ukraine that competed in an election, the results of which we, the United States, recognized.
[03:14:01.384 --> 03:14:10.571]  The individual that he elected, Viktor Yukanovich, then went on to take Ukraine into the European Union
[03:14:11.603 --> 03:14:15.564]  Over the opposition of Vladimir Putin.
[03:14:15.564 --> 03:14:27.388]  There's nothing untoward or illegal or improper about Manafort's representation of a political party in a foreign country.
[03:14:27.388 --> 03:14:28.728]  It's perfectly proper.
[03:14:28.728 --> 03:14:31.449]  In fact, it's common.
[03:14:31.449 --> 03:14:39.351]  Some have said, well, because Yukonovich was a pro-Eastern, that shows that Manafort is in bed with the Russians.
[03:14:40.120 --> 03:14:42.401]  It shows nothing of the kind.
[03:14:42.401 --> 03:14:43.502]  But that's all they've got.
[03:14:43.502 --> 03:14:45.102]  You've been saying that for over a year.
[03:14:45.102 --> 03:14:46.063]  That's what's come out.
[03:14:46.063 --> 03:14:50.364]  But the big problem I've read from this is they're now looking with what you predicted with total precision.
[03:14:50.364 --> 03:14:51.665]  It's just true.
[03:14:51.665 --> 03:14:57.488]  That next it would be, oh, banks or money or campaign money or laundering or not paying all his taxes.
[03:14:57.488 --> 03:15:03.890]  And now they admit it's a total dragnet of his friends, his family, the entire Trump organization, any media that supports him.
[03:15:03.890 --> 03:15:07.832]  It's an intimidation, not just a witch hunt, but the message, you back Trump,
[03:15:08.352 --> 03:15:15.098]  Exactly right, exactly right.
[03:15:15.098 --> 03:15:30.831]  And we have seen this by Mueller's publicly stated intention that he's going to look at real estate transactions done by Donald Trump 25 years ago, long before he entered the public arena of politics.
[03:15:30.831 --> 03:15:36.996]  Alex, they believe, or at least they purport to believe, that Russian-funded bots
[03:15:37.789 --> 03:15:44.929]  Uh, have taken the InfoWars links of some of our best stories and put them out on the internet.
[03:15:44.929 --> 03:15:45.952]  This is a lie!
[03:15:46.699 --> 03:15:49.380]  There is no evidence to this effect.
[03:15:49.380 --> 03:15:54.661]  It's merely a way to blacken your name and try to discredit InfoWars.
[03:15:54.661 --> 03:15:57.361]  There is no there, there.
[03:15:57.361 --> 03:15:59.842]  I can tell you what Mueller's got in his hand.
[03:15:59.842 --> 03:16:01.062]  Nothing.
[03:16:01.062 --> 03:16:01.822]  Zero.
[03:16:01.822 --> 03:16:07.903]  The Russian thing is the ultimate nothing burger, just like global warming and all the rest of it, but are man-made, anthropogenic, but expanding on that.
[03:16:07.903 --> 03:16:09.944]  Then we're going to these calls and skip this break so you get more time.
[03:16:12.492 --> 03:16:17.396]  Clearly, though, their strategy is just get this grand jury that comes out of the swamp.
[03:16:17.396 --> 03:16:20.338]  91% voted for Hillary.
[03:16:20.338 --> 03:16:26.762]  Clearly, it's just shake the voodoo stick at things and just say, oh, look, they're criminal over and over again.
[03:16:26.762 --> 03:16:33.146]  And then just say abracadabra and subpoena and SWAT team enough people until that materializes.
[03:16:33.146 --> 03:16:34.507]  But I just don't see the public buying it.
[03:16:35.852 --> 03:16:37.013]  No, it's kind of interesting.
[03:16:37.013 --> 03:16:56.605]  What you have, and it's very noticeable, Brennan, Clapper, Rogers, and all of the deep state talking heads saying over and over again, we know the Russians interfered with the American elections and they colluded with the Trump campaign.
[03:16:56.605 --> 03:17:02.289]  They mindlessly repeat it over and over and over, and it's a lie.
[03:17:03.032 --> 03:17:09.196]  And they know it's a lie, but they think if they keep saying it, that people will believe it.
[03:17:09.196 --> 03:17:16.200]  The national polls say, even in their fake polls, 6% think Russia's real or important in New York Times polls.
[03:17:16.200 --> 03:17:17.581]  People are sick of it.
[03:17:17.581 --> 03:17:24.666]  Their own party constituents say, fire Pelosi from leadership, fire Waters, we're sick of these losers, we want jobs.
[03:17:24.666 --> 03:17:27.768]  Well, Trump's giving you, in fact there's a clip Daria was pointing out,
[03:17:28.268 --> 03:17:34.133]  My Russian handler, I'm joking, I shouldn't even joke about that, she's the biggest Russian I've actually got here.
[03:17:34.133 --> 03:17:36.134]  She is of evil Russian lineage.
[03:17:36.134 --> 03:17:48.184]  She was pointing out a video we ought to air from the news, I'll dig it out here after calls, where, I mean, they're pointing out Trump is giving people classic, nationalistic, JFK-style economic stuff.
[03:17:48.184 --> 03:17:53.608]  I mean, he's more of an old-fashioned Democrat when it comes to economic policies than he's a Republican.
[03:17:55.357 --> 03:17:59.200]  One million new jobs since he became president.
[03:17:59.200 --> 03:18:02.802]  The stock market hitting record levels.
[03:18:02.802 --> 03:18:06.985]  Cutting back the low-level regulations that are holding America back.
[03:18:07.774 --> 03:18:13.096]  These are the stories you won't read on the front page of the New York Times or the Washington Post.
[03:18:13.096 --> 03:18:17.477]  These are the stories that won't lead on CBS or CNN.
[03:18:17.477 --> 03:18:18.717]  That's the real story.
[03:18:18.717 --> 03:18:36.123]  Yes, he is a John F. Kennedy, rising tide lifts all boats, style Democrat with a small D. And the fact that Trump is bringing us prosperity, when they predicted the stock market would crash if he was elected, is driving them insane.
[03:18:37.489 --> 03:18:38.670]  And that really is the thing.
[03:18:38.670 --> 03:18:46.257]  I noticed on Monday, or no, last Friday, Drudge tweeted the jobs numbers from CNBC.
[03:18:46.257 --> 03:18:49.279]  Hardly a right-wing, you know, bastion of propaganda.
[03:18:49.279 --> 03:18:51.061]  It was just the job numbers.
[03:18:51.061 --> 03:18:53.363]  And they blocked Trump.
[03:18:55.101 --> 03:19:05.169]  Eric Trump, his son, the tweet, it just said, this is sensitive, this is, you know, this could violate our terms, which has a whole list of racist, all that crap, if you go read the rules.
[03:19:05.169 --> 03:19:14.597]  Just a link, it wasn't even Drudge's production, it was just a Drudge tweet with, oh, look at the great job numbers, and look at the small business numbers, the best in decades, and they're like, oh, you can't see that.
[03:19:14.597 --> 03:19:21.522]  These people are, even in communist China, they let people tweet out positive stuff about the economy.
[03:19:21.522 --> 03:19:23.104]  I mean, this is beyond North Korea.
[03:19:24.861 --> 03:19:29.243]  Censorship is kind of the last vestige of the scoundrels here.
[03:19:29.243 --> 03:19:31.683]  They can't argue with us on the merits.
[03:19:31.683 --> 03:19:34.464]  They can't argue with us on the facts.
[03:19:34.464 --> 03:19:36.945]  So they try to silence us.
[03:19:36.945 --> 03:19:53.411]  This is why I'm affiliated with the FreeOurInternet.org movement to make sure that the internet remains a true level playing field and that important outlets like InfoWars and Breitbart and The Daily Caller and others
[03:19:54.071 --> 03:19:58.452]  Cannot be censored, cannot be blocked, cannot be silenced.
[03:19:58.452 --> 03:20:00.873]  We are not going to be silenced.
[03:20:00.873 --> 03:20:03.153]  We will not stand for it.
[03:20:03.153 --> 03:20:14.096]  We will take drastic action to defend our First Amendment rights and our rights to a free press and our rights to a free association.
[03:20:14.096 --> 03:20:16.677]  They are really down to censorship as a tactic.
[03:20:17.330 --> 03:20:20.893]  Because they've lost the war of ideas and they know that.
[03:20:20.893 --> 03:20:23.416]  And historically, that's one of the biggest losing tactics.
[03:20:23.416 --> 03:20:31.743]  I mean, when you go to the desperate censorship button and then they have to admit it, now Google employees, Facebook, Twitter start defecting, start leaking more data.
[03:20:31.743 --> 03:20:32.684]  It's hurting them worse.
[03:20:32.684 --> 03:20:40.712]  I mean, Trump needs to move against Facebook, Twitter and Google for antitrust, for campaign violations, for clearly
[03:20:41.212 --> 03:20:54.698]  Because anybody has free speech outside campaign law, but when you get directives from the Democratic Party, as WikiLeaks shows, and you go out and try to shut down the general speech, it's racketeering by the very definition of it!
[03:20:54.698 --> 03:20:55.499]  Well, you're right.
[03:20:55.499 --> 03:21:08.005]  It would be excellent if the Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust would take a look at these issues, but unfortunately that position is vacant thanks to Reince Priebus's inability to
[03:21:09.057 --> 03:21:13.802]  Because the president is unaware of the fact that there is a vacancy
[03:21:32.737 --> 03:21:36.338]  Because General Kelly has not told him there's a vacancy.
[03:21:36.338 --> 03:21:39.839]  Mr. Priebus didn't tell him that there was a vacancy.
[03:21:39.839 --> 03:21:45.181]  The current administration... Instead there's an Obama snot nose right below operating in that position.
[03:21:45.181 --> 03:21:45.321]  Right.
[03:21:45.321 --> 03:21:50.262]  What's happening today in Washington is the current administration in place is 20% Trump and 80% Obama.
[03:21:53.084 --> 03:22:02.646]  At the second and third levels of government, all decisions, all information, all operations are controlled by the Obama holdover.
[03:22:02.646 --> 03:22:04.046]  And they're dug in.
[03:22:04.046 --> 03:22:06.247]  The man responsible for this?
[03:22:06.247 --> 03:22:07.787]  Reince Priebus.
[03:22:07.787 --> 03:22:09.227]  Remember that name.
[03:22:09.227 --> 03:22:12.608]  He is responsible.
[03:22:12.608 --> 03:22:14.728]  Amazing.
[03:22:14.728 --> 03:22:15.548]  I gotta go to these calls.
[03:22:15.548 --> 03:22:16.929]  They're so awesome.
[03:22:16.929 --> 03:22:17.409]  Let's do it.
[03:22:17.409 --> 03:22:18.229]  But just briefly.
[03:22:19.628 --> 03:22:20.728]  Is Kelly going to survive?
[03:22:20.728 --> 03:22:30.291]  Because this new stuff where he is sending communiques to Soros, and then more is even coming out, not just from your sources, this is all confirmed, that he's an actual Soros mole.
[03:22:30.291 --> 03:22:32.431]  I mean, how long did he survive?
[03:22:32.431 --> 03:22:37.332]  Just to be clear, I think you're referring to McMaster rather than Kelly.
[03:22:37.332 --> 03:22:39.693]  Oh, I apologize, McMaster, excuse me.
[03:22:39.693 --> 03:22:44.254]  Yeah, look, McMaster was affiliated with the International Institute for Strategic Studies
[03:22:45.041 --> 03:22:51.207]  Uh, funded by the Saudis, the Chinese, uh, and, uh, George Soros.
[03:22:51.207 --> 03:23:01.196]  Israeli intelligence sources have confirmed for InfoWars, uh, that McMaster and Soros are in direct email touch.
[03:23:02.243 --> 03:23:10.447]  This is not surprising because into the White House policy shop, McMaster's has brought a woman named Fiona Hill.
[03:23:10.447 --> 03:23:15.370]  She comes directly from the payroll of George Soros.
[03:23:15.370 --> 03:23:18.732]  And she's in charge of Russia policy.
[03:23:18.732 --> 03:23:21.613]  You can't make this stuff up.
[03:23:21.613 --> 03:23:22.994]  It's just extraordinary.
[03:23:23.941 --> 03:23:33.586]  McMaster leaked information to the acting FBI director, Andy McCabe, and has been personally derisive of the President's family.
[03:23:33.586 --> 03:23:43.830]  McMaster has been trying to oust the loyalist Sebastian Gorka, who supports the President's non-intervention foreign policy.
[03:23:43.830 --> 03:23:51.794]  McMaster essentially cleared Susan Rice of political espionage, saying there was nothing wrong with it.
[03:23:52.535 --> 03:24:05.725]  And he extended her national security clearance so even today she can receive top secret information regarding our foreign policy and lag it to Obama.
[03:24:05.725 --> 03:24:17.254]  It is really extraordinary the way the information regarding McMaster has been... And you got a shadow White House a mile and a half down the road with Obama admitting he's got moles dug in.
[03:24:17.254 --> 03:24:18.454]  This is incredible.
[03:24:18.454 --> 03:24:20.056]  Kevin, thank you for holding like a trooper.
[03:24:20.056 --> 03:24:21.297]  You're on the air worldwide.
[03:24:21.297 --> 03:24:21.617]  Go ahead.
[03:24:22.708 --> 03:24:24.569]  Hey guys, how is everybody doing today?
[03:24:24.569 --> 03:24:25.469]  I hope well.
[03:24:25.469 --> 03:24:26.049]  Thank you.
[03:24:26.049 --> 03:24:27.009]  Good.
[03:24:27.009 --> 03:24:32.011]  North Korea is nothing more than a distraction than what Roger Stone has just laid out.
[03:24:32.011 --> 03:24:41.553]  Remember when Bill Clinton or Monica Lewinsky was testifying about how she got the stain on her blue dress and she came out and nobody was there to greet her?
[03:24:41.553 --> 03:24:45.515]  Because he shot cruise missiles at an aspirin factory.
[03:24:45.515 --> 03:24:46.415]  Absolutely.
[03:24:46.415 --> 03:24:48.515]  This is nothing more than a distraction.
[03:24:48.515 --> 03:24:49.556]  That's all it is.
[03:24:50.832 --> 03:24:56.397]  Kim Jong Yum, or whatever his name is, is not going to nuke the United States.
[03:24:56.397 --> 03:24:58.339]  He doesn't have them.
[03:24:58.339 --> 03:24:59.260]  At all.
[03:24:59.260 --> 03:25:05.665]  Adam Curry was asking about the genesis of the report that he was wondering how that report came from.
[03:25:05.665 --> 03:25:15.154]  The genesis of that report is the same genesis that incubate babies in the incubators, Saddam has weapons of mass destruction, and Russians hacked the election.
[03:25:15.154 --> 03:25:15.534]  It's fake.
[03:25:18.186 --> 03:25:18.747]  Absolutely.
[03:25:18.747 --> 03:25:19.328]  Great call.
[03:25:19.328 --> 03:25:20.109]  Great point, Kevin.
[03:25:20.109 --> 03:25:20.930]  Thank you for holding.
[03:25:20.930 --> 03:25:22.812]  Kevin, come on hold.
[03:25:22.812 --> 03:25:29.881]  I want to send him a free bottle of X2 or a CNN's Fake News t-shirt or a Bill Clinton rape shirt, whatever he chooses.
[03:25:29.881 --> 03:25:31.022]  He's been holding too long.
[03:25:31.022 --> 03:25:32.844]  Everybody holding, whether I get to you or not, you get...
[03:25:33.745 --> 03:25:37.528]  A t-shirt or a bottle of X2 or whatever you want, basically, from the supplements.
[03:25:37.528 --> 03:25:38.529]  Appreciate that, Kevin.
[03:25:38.529 --> 03:25:39.590]  I've got to take more calls.
[03:25:39.590 --> 03:25:49.478]  The only problem with my show is I'm not taking enough calls, and it's wrong, and it's insulting to make you hold for an hour, and I'm going to get better about it, or Nico is going to punch me in the nose.
[03:25:49.478 --> 03:25:51.800]  Even though Nico is so nice, we never do that.
[03:25:51.800 --> 03:25:54.182]  And Rodgers Jones is going to start using external mics, which he's doing.
[03:25:54.182 --> 03:25:55.523]  He's good, too.
[03:25:55.523 --> 03:25:56.484]  Let's go ahead now.
[03:25:56.484 --> 03:25:58.025]  Who's been on the longest here?
[03:25:58.025 --> 03:25:59.146]  Bill in Wisconsin.
[03:25:59.146 --> 03:25:59.807]  You're on the air.
[03:25:59.807 --> 03:26:00.107]  Welcome.
[03:26:01.877 --> 03:26:03.478]  Yeah, right on, Kevin.
[03:26:03.478 --> 03:26:05.879]  You hit the nail on the head.
[03:26:05.879 --> 03:26:12.102]  I'm a grunt that supported Trump out here in Wisconsin.
[03:26:12.102 --> 03:26:18.564]  I worked hard for him, and I'm sick of hearing about how he is being protected.
[03:26:18.564 --> 03:26:21.145]  He puts all these guys in.
[03:26:21.145 --> 03:26:23.306]  McMaster, okay?
[03:26:23.306 --> 03:26:26.748]  Christopher Wray.
[03:26:26.748 --> 03:26:28.048]  Nikki Haley.
[03:26:28.048 --> 03:26:31.330]  He puts them all in there and then throws up his hands and says,
[03:26:31.863 --> 03:26:33.524]  What a mess we got.
[03:26:33.524 --> 03:26:41.307]  Either he is stupid or we are being played once again.
[03:26:41.307 --> 03:26:44.889]  I've had long discussions with Roger Stone on this and I know I'm right.
[03:26:44.889 --> 03:26:51.412]  The elite hate him because he's trying to be the president and wants to do policies that help America and hurt their globalism.
[03:26:52.443 --> 03:26:55.125]  That said, he literally eats McDonald's for real.
[03:26:55.125 --> 03:26:56.046]  I thought that was a joke.
[03:26:56.046 --> 03:27:00.250]  He eats steaks overcooked with the ketchup, which is a sin.
[03:27:00.250 --> 03:27:05.014]  And he literally is 71 years old and doesn't get it fully.
[03:27:05.014 --> 03:27:10.939]  He's a patriot, better than Ronald Reagan, but you don't understand, he doesn't know the pedigrees of all these people.
[03:27:10.939 --> 03:27:13.702]  I do this 18 hours a day and I can't keep track of it all.
[03:27:13.702 --> 03:27:14.723]  Roger, is that unaccurate?
[03:27:15.953 --> 03:27:18.974]  You know, Alex, I think he's willfully misled.
[03:27:18.974 --> 03:27:27.997]  As I've said here many times in my 40-year experience with him, when he has all the information, he almost always makes the right decision.
[03:27:27.997 --> 03:27:29.417]  He's a patriot at heart.
[03:27:29.417 --> 03:27:40.241]  So they show him, for example, Dina Habib Powell's resume, and they say, Mr. President, she's a good Republican and she's got extensive foreign policy experience.
[03:27:41.264 --> 03:27:46.768]  They don't mention her associations with Huma Abedin or Condi Rice.
[03:27:46.768 --> 03:27:49.069]  And then when it comes up, he goes, OK, get rid of her.
[03:27:49.069 --> 03:27:50.490]  They go, oh, sir, that'll look weak.
[03:27:50.490 --> 03:27:51.110]  Don't do that.
[03:27:51.110 --> 03:27:54.413]  They're in total rebellion against him.
[03:27:54.413 --> 03:27:55.873]  Believe me.
[03:27:55.873 --> 03:27:58.995]  And we have the perfect example of this past week.
[03:27:58.995 --> 03:28:04.419]  The president put out a statement in support of McMaster's because he was tricked into doing so.
[03:28:05.876 --> 03:28:17.146]  Kelly went to him and said, Mr. President, some people, never said conservatives, never said Trump supporters, some people are criticizing McMaster's for not being sufficiently pro-Israel.
[03:28:17.146 --> 03:28:21.850]  We'd like to put out a statement in support of him from you saying that he is for Israel.
[03:28:21.850 --> 03:28:24.373]  Read the statement.
[03:28:24.373 --> 03:28:30.438]  No one said, oh, by the way, Mr. President, he also just gave Susan Rice a pass for political espionage.
[03:28:30.914 --> 03:28:32.898]  And he extended her security clearance.
[03:28:32.898 --> 03:28:35.643]  They didn't tell the president of that.
[03:28:35.643 --> 03:28:37.186]  He's not a mind reader.
[03:28:37.186 --> 03:28:38.569]  This isn't the great Karnak.
[03:28:39.173 --> 03:28:44.795]  They give him partial information to trick him into being manipulated.
[03:28:44.795 --> 03:28:45.676]  Bill's a county commissioner.
[03:28:45.676 --> 03:28:47.657]  I've been calling for like 15 years, if I remember.
[03:28:47.657 --> 03:28:48.117]  Great guy.
[03:28:48.117 --> 03:28:49.037]  I've seen a lot of great intel.
[03:28:49.037 --> 03:28:50.878]  He's been a guest on before, so I respect.
[03:28:50.878 --> 03:28:52.779]  He's run some things before in business, too.
[03:28:52.779 --> 03:28:54.019]  I know Bill is.
[03:28:54.019 --> 03:28:56.620]  So I'm not talking down to him here, but let me tell you something.
[03:28:56.620 --> 03:29:00.382]  I got like 80 employees and they're great people, but let me tell you.
[03:29:00.942 --> 03:29:07.123]  We've gone through some problems, we've gone through management, we've gone through folks saying they're doing something they're not, BS in your face.
[03:29:07.123 --> 03:29:11.044]  I'm managing 80 people and I got great people and it's hard.
[03:29:11.044 --> 03:29:13.044]  I don't know what it's like managing 4,000.
[03:29:13.044 --> 03:29:16.285]  So, I'm telling you, I'm not here apologizing for the president.
[03:29:16.285 --> 03:29:18.425]  I have sat there, gotten him information.
[03:29:18.425 --> 03:29:19.785]  I don't mean to have a heyday with this.
[03:29:19.785 --> 03:29:21.426]  He's checked it and acted on it.
[03:29:21.426 --> 03:29:22.986]  That's why they go, oh he's so unstable.
[03:29:22.986 --> 03:29:25.826]  No, he really does act when he gets good info.
[03:29:25.826 --> 03:29:29.167]  The problem is there's such a bunch of cowards in Washington and scum.
[03:29:29.847 --> 03:29:32.208]  You understand what I'm saying, Bill?
[03:29:32.208 --> 03:29:35.529]  Oh, Alex, I want one t-shirt.
[03:29:35.529 --> 03:29:38.610]  I voted for Trump, not Ivanka.
[03:29:38.610 --> 03:29:39.991]  Okay?
[03:29:39.991 --> 03:29:47.054]  She set up, she and Jared set up that trip over there where we saw the dancing Saudis.
[03:29:47.874 --> 03:29:48.515]  No, I know.
[03:29:48.515 --> 03:29:49.757]  Certainly Trump.
[03:29:49.757 --> 03:29:51.239]  Trump's 71 years old, man.
[03:29:51.239 --> 03:29:52.981]  Look, imagine how bad it'd be if we didn't have him.
[03:29:52.981 --> 03:29:54.082]  That's all I'm saying.
[03:29:54.082 --> 03:29:55.103]  Imagine if we had Hillary.
[03:29:55.103 --> 03:29:56.445]  We're gonna come right back.
[03:29:56.445 --> 03:30:01.371]  We got Roger's guest coming up too, but I'm gonna come right back.
[03:30:01.371 --> 03:30:03.294]  I'm telling you folks, he's not perfect.
[03:30:03.294 --> 03:30:03.754]  He's not Jesus.
[03:30:07.637 --> 03:30:09.038]  Why is the fungus?
[03:30:09.038 --> 03:30:10.119]  Why is the mold?
[03:30:10.119 --> 03:30:11.880]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[03:30:11.880 --> 03:30:12.841]  What is going on?
[03:30:12.841 --> 03:30:13.601]  What has changed?
[03:30:37.897 --> 03:30:39.318]  We only have a limited supply of this.
[03:30:39.318 --> 03:30:40.358]  I want to get your reviews.
[03:30:40.358 --> 03:30:41.298]  I want to hear what you have to say.
[03:30:41.298 --> 03:30:42.758]  For me, it's been incredible.
[03:30:42.758 --> 03:30:47.280]  MycoZX, antifungal, antifungus, anti-yeast.
[03:30:47.280 --> 03:30:48.000]  Get it today.
[03:30:48.000 --> 03:30:48.600]  Limited run.
[03:30:48.600 --> 03:30:50.001]  It'll be months till we get more.
[03:30:50.001 --> 03:30:54.662]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:30:54.662 --> 03:30:58.003]  I cannot sell something unless it helps somebody.
[03:30:58.003 --> 03:31:00.343]  And you can't support an organization that isn't fighting hard.
[03:31:00.343 --> 03:31:02.204]  Look at the response we're getting.
[03:31:02.204 --> 03:31:03.684]  We're changing the world together.
[03:31:03.684 --> 03:31:04.705]  You are the InfoWar.
[03:31:04.705 --> 03:31:05.445]  God bless you all.
[03:31:06.989 --> 03:31:16.077]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[03:31:16.077 --> 03:31:24.484]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:31:24.484 --> 03:31:29.368]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[03:31:29.368 --> 03:31:33.011]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee.
[03:31:34.212 --> 03:31:35.012]  We're good to go.
[03:31:58.200 --> 03:32:04.485]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[03:32:04.485 --> 03:32:06.986]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[03:32:06.986 --> 03:32:17.414]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[03:32:17.554 --> 03:32:19.615]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[03:32:19.615 --> 03:32:22.496]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[03:32:22.496 --> 03:32:23.977]  It's made in the USA.
[03:32:23.977 --> 03:32:30.800]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[03:32:30.800 --> 03:32:32.061]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[03:32:32.881 --> 03:32:42.589]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[03:32:42.589 --> 03:32:59.422]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[03:32:59.422 --> 03:33:02.565]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[03:33:02.705 --> 03:33:12.567]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield at InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:33:12.567 --> 03:33:17.028]  It's Roger Stone, and he's got another guest coming on.
[03:33:17.028 --> 03:33:22.270]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:22.270 --> 03:33:27.511]  I used to be such a sweet, sweet thing till they got a hold of me.
[03:33:35.396 --> 03:33:40.518]  I got no friends!
[03:33:40.518 --> 03:33:45.380]  They can't be seen with me.
[03:33:45.380 --> 03:33:49.421]  And I'm feeling real shot down.
[03:33:49.421 --> 03:33:53.303]  But this isn't the 1970s.
[03:33:53.303 --> 03:33:55.163]  When MSM could attack you and destroy you.
[03:33:55.163 --> 03:34:00.365]  Now, a large portion of the public knows it's a badge of honor.
[03:34:00.365 --> 03:34:01.405]  They're running out of gas.
[03:34:01.405 --> 03:34:02.666]  I'm gonna get out of here in a minute or two.
[03:34:04.033 --> 03:34:05.535]  Riding shotgun with Roger Stone.
[03:34:05.535 --> 03:34:08.918]  He's got a guest coming on as we look at the battle of the heart and soul.
[03:34:08.918 --> 03:34:10.720]  When we fight for stuff with Trump, we get it.
[03:34:10.720 --> 03:34:15.424]  When we back off and say he's not perfect, the globalists win.
[03:34:15.424 --> 03:34:16.525]  They are panicked.
[03:34:16.525 --> 03:34:19.589]  Their reaction to Trump is not kabuki theater.
[03:34:19.589 --> 03:34:22.952]  It is as real as it gets.
[03:34:22.952 --> 03:34:24.674]  Does that mean we're getting something perfect here?
[03:34:24.674 --> 03:34:25.695]  Absolutely not.
[03:34:26.832 --> 03:34:31.737]  I have the best intentions of stuff I do, and I make mistakes and get the wrong info and do stuff.
[03:34:31.737 --> 03:34:33.899]  The difference is I have good will.
[03:34:33.899 --> 03:34:36.661]  The globalists have bad will towards you, and it's the same thing with Trump.
[03:34:36.661 --> 03:34:41.906]  He has good will, classic Americana, kind of pig-headed, but aren't a lot of good guys like that?
[03:34:41.906 --> 03:34:49.674]  If they didn't get pushed around their whole lives and turned into somebody else, they are originally what they were, genetically, culturally, historically.
[03:34:51.175 --> 03:34:55.597]  Roger Stone's taken over, but he mentioned their big attack at censorship.
[03:34:55.597 --> 03:35:00.079]  We've had AdBlade with Google ban us off the ads.
[03:35:00.079 --> 03:35:02.640]  We've been kicked off Google Store.
[03:35:02.640 --> 03:35:07.242]  We've just had everything happen to us since Trump won, trying to shut down our funding.
[03:35:07.242 --> 03:35:11.424]  There's a new story on Infowars.com by Kit Daniels.
[03:35:11.424 --> 03:35:15.546]  Agency selling sex toy ads and barely legal videos.
[03:35:16.684 --> 03:35:17.904]  That's what they're promoting.
[03:35:17.904 --> 03:35:22.606]  Blacklist obscene InfoWars ads for hate and racism.
[03:35:22.606 --> 03:35:34.290]  They said the potential, the potential, concentrated effort to censor free-thinking libertarians.
[03:35:34.290 --> 03:35:39.372]  It was a very popular ad platform, California-based AJ Affiliates.
[03:35:39.372 --> 03:35:44.094]  I had the idea, or Frigier had the idea, we had the idea together to have an affiliate program with our stations
[03:35:45.578 --> 03:35:54.745]  Where we then basically promote ads for their products at their stations on this system and we push them on InfoWars and it's an affiliate program and builds and builds and builds.
[03:35:54.745 --> 03:36:00.729]  We've been very successful with other systems like this and they were all ready to sign us up and they said, oh my gosh, we can't.
[03:36:00.729 --> 03:36:01.950]  You violate our terms of service.
[03:36:01.950 --> 03:36:03.291]  This is a giant company.
[03:36:03.291 --> 03:36:04.111]  It's discriminatory.
[03:36:04.111 --> 03:36:10.276]  Now, you can have a gay couple going in and wanting their cake baked and then everybody jumps on to sue the
[03:36:11.713 --> 03:36:14.915]  To the people who are not baking, and I say bake the cake.
[03:36:14.915 --> 03:36:26.742]  But when it's big financial institutions and groups and credit card companies saying, we're not going to do business, you're not real news, there's no judge, there's no jury, that's defamatory, that's fraud.
[03:36:26.742 --> 03:36:29.024]  And so I am considering legal action.
[03:36:29.024 --> 03:36:40.311]  I don't want a lawsuit, I don't want to have to look around for the right lawyers to do it, but I'm putting these folks on notice right now that I've told people I'm getting ready to file a lawsuit because we've got to do something about this.
[03:36:41.624 --> 03:36:44.167]  And I've filed lawsuits before and everybody knows that.
[03:36:44.167 --> 03:36:45.409]  I've been successful every time.
[03:36:45.409 --> 03:36:50.916]  But it's because we develop real cases, we don't just throw lawsuits out there.
[03:36:50.916 --> 03:36:53.319]  And we just want them to stop doing what they're doing.
[03:36:53.319 --> 03:36:56.864]  And we want others to know, there's a precedent here, you're not going to discriminate against us.
[03:36:59.236 --> 03:37:07.460]  Advertising agency denied business with Infowars due to possibility of obscene, abusive, violent, bigoted, or hate-oriented content.
[03:37:07.460 --> 03:37:13.884]  Despite the fact that the agency does business with sex shops, barely legal magazines, and clients accused of selling hate content.
[03:37:13.884 --> 03:37:22.109]  By the way, I've been in Hustler magazine, not as a photograph spread, but three articles I've written have been in Hustler, one of them on the cover.
[03:37:23.460 --> 03:37:31.005]  And I don't totally agree with everything going on in Hustler, but at the same time, it was a place to publish my controversial views.
[03:37:31.005 --> 03:37:33.266]  And Larry Flynn's a listener.
[03:37:33.266 --> 03:37:34.647]  That's on record.
[03:37:34.647 --> 03:37:38.930]  Now, are they going to ban Hustler now?
[03:37:38.930 --> 03:37:42.452]  Because you choose to opt in to have these ads on your website.
[03:37:42.452 --> 03:37:44.674]  So this is all incredible.
[03:37:46.854 --> 03:37:52.778]  California-based AJ Affiliates, a major affiliate marketing firm for websites, said it consulted with legal team.
[03:37:52.778 --> 03:37:55.039]  Well, your legal team's a little bit more busy now.
[03:37:55.039 --> 03:38:06.027]  About info wars and decided not to move forward, which suggests the company is picking and choosing clients based on political affiliations through the false veil of combating obscene and hate given to its clients.
[03:38:06.027 --> 03:38:08.589]  I mean, our ads are very, very tame.
[03:38:08.589 --> 03:38:14.673]  In fact, on a scale of 1 to 10, 0 being the most tame and 10 being out of control, our ads are like a 2, folks.
[03:38:14.673 --> 03:38:16.294]  We're just straight up, oh, here's water filters.
[03:38:17.454 --> 03:38:30.704]  For one thing, CJ Affiliates does business with Discount Magazines, which sells subscriptions to Hustlers, barely legal magazine, and Adam and Eve, the self-proclaimed number one source for adult toys.
[03:38:30.704 --> 03:38:38.250]  And it just goes on and on and on here, what they wrote back to us.
[03:38:38.250 --> 03:38:42.813]  In fact, I don't know, we should probably publish their letter to us, hear about it.
[03:38:42.813 --> 03:38:45.015]  They have Cafe Press, they have everybody else in here.
[03:38:47.799 --> 03:38:50.401]  And they selectively enforce what they want.
[03:38:50.401 --> 03:38:51.282]  And it's discriminatory.
[03:38:51.282 --> 03:38:57.227]  And they're just trying to put my name out there that I'm this evil pariah, I'm this devil, I killed the kids at Sandy Hook.
[03:38:57.227 --> 03:38:58.708]  It's basically what they're saying now.
[03:38:58.708 --> 03:39:00.830]  It's all made up in an attempt to set the precedent.
[03:39:00.830 --> 03:39:04.913]  So we need folks to support us and buy the products from infowarestore.com.
[03:39:04.913 --> 03:39:12.199]  Because whether it's Google, or Facebook, or Twitter, or these platforms, more and more we're being isolated as a message to everybody.
[03:39:13.083 --> 03:39:15.564]  So take advantage of the 1776 specials right now.
[03:39:15.564 --> 03:39:17.625]  55% off on Brain Force.
[03:39:17.625 --> 03:39:19.045]  We've never done that.
[03:39:19.045 --> 03:39:19.745]  55% off on X2.
[03:39:19.745 --> 03:39:20.946]  It's an amazing product.
[03:39:20.946 --> 03:39:24.727]  And so much more, because we found we sell even more when we discount even more.
[03:39:24.727 --> 03:39:27.788]  So the more you buy from us, the more we can drop the price.
[03:39:27.788 --> 03:39:34.710]  But I'm trying to expand around here, so please, come up to the counter there and get some great products and shop with the good guys at infowarrestore.com.
[03:39:34.710 --> 03:39:38.712]  And you've got my commitment to never back down and to get you results!
[03:39:39.616 --> 03:39:42.137]  You can talk all day about Trump's results are amazing.
[03:39:42.137 --> 03:39:42.757]  Is he perfect?
[03:39:42.757 --> 03:39:43.618]  No.
[03:39:43.618 --> 03:39:45.358]  But look at what he's done delivering.
[03:39:45.358 --> 03:39:46.979]  Well, we've really delivered.
[03:39:46.979 --> 03:39:51.621]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:39:51.621 --> 03:39:56.703]  And again, this is a great article by Kit Daniels who writes like eight articles a day.
[03:39:56.703 --> 03:39:59.824]  Let's add screenshots of their letter to us.
[03:39:59.824 --> 03:40:02.906]  I want to add that in there so people see exactly.
[03:40:02.906 --> 03:40:05.587]  I mean, the emails, everything from a full correspondence, put it up there.
[03:40:07.030 --> 03:40:10.331]  Roger, you've got your guest to go to, very important, but this is emergency breaking news.
[03:40:10.331 --> 03:40:12.451]  This just illustrates what's happening.
[03:40:12.451 --> 03:40:20.333]  Just like you're going to have to counter-sue, you're having to raise money right now because Obama set up a team of lawyers, admits he's suing you through them.
[03:40:20.333 --> 03:40:21.753]  He can clearly be a plaintiff now.
[03:40:21.753 --> 03:40:22.993]  It's time to fight!
[03:40:22.993 --> 03:40:25.214]  And you're moving forward with lawyers.
[03:40:25.214 --> 03:40:30.155]  I'm looking at who I'm going to sue here, but it's down to
[03:40:32.301 --> 03:40:35.502]  Certain yogurt company that we... I'm going to leave it at that.
[03:40:35.502 --> 03:40:38.022]  It's down to these people, Google, a lot of folks.
[03:40:38.022 --> 03:40:41.783]  Google I put on notice and they at least put our stuff back at the top listing.
[03:40:41.783 --> 03:40:42.863]  But I mean, what do we do about this?
[03:40:42.863 --> 03:40:51.965]  We have Google in the internal documents hiring companies to censor us and saying that we lied about Syrian rebels launching chemical attacks when it was confirmed by our own government.
[03:40:51.965 --> 03:40:55.926]  They say that's the fake news and even use exhibits of why we're being banned, Roger.
[03:40:58.034 --> 03:41:09.439]  Alex, ironically, the same day that they told you that they would not do business with you, they also told me they would not do business with my site, the Stone Cold Truth.
[03:41:09.439 --> 03:41:12.900]  This happened previously, as you know, with a company called AdRoll.
[03:41:13.522 --> 03:41:17.266]  So if you decide to sue, I'm with you.
[03:41:17.266 --> 03:41:19.047]  It's time to fight back.
[03:41:19.047 --> 03:41:19.368]  That's right.
[03:41:19.368 --> 03:41:20.849]  I said AdBlade earlier.
[03:41:20.849 --> 03:41:22.030]  It's AdRoll, AdRoll.
[03:41:22.030 --> 03:41:23.131]  I apologize to AdBlade.
[03:41:23.131 --> 03:41:24.293]  They're wonderful folks.
[03:41:24.293 --> 03:41:25.254]  AdRoll, AdRoll.
[03:41:25.254 --> 03:41:27.296]  I apologize to AdBlade.
[03:41:27.296 --> 03:41:27.516]  Go ahead.
[03:41:29.617 --> 03:41:33.438]  It's just outrageous, and you're right, it's selective.
[03:41:33.438 --> 03:41:35.999]  It has nothing to do with our content.
[03:41:35.999 --> 03:41:42.020]  There's nothing inappropriate or hateful or obscene about any of our content.
[03:41:42.020 --> 03:41:44.621]  Their problem is we tell the truth.
[03:41:44.621 --> 03:41:50.202]  Their problem is that we expose the conspiracy theories of the left.
[03:41:50.202 --> 03:41:53.543]  I mean, the mainstream media is absolutely right.
[03:41:54.284 --> 03:41:57.365]  Conspiracy theories are a big problem today.
[03:41:57.365 --> 03:42:03.828]  The problem is that most of them are promulgated by the government and by the mainstream media.
[03:42:03.828 --> 03:42:06.569]  All we do, Alex, is correct the record.
[03:42:06.569 --> 03:42:10.010]  All we do is debunk their conspiracy theories.
[03:42:10.010 --> 03:42:11.551]  I'll give you an example.
[03:42:11.551 --> 03:42:13.171]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[03:42:13.171 --> 03:42:14.972]  I'll give you a perfect example.
[03:42:14.972 --> 03:42:17.613]  The Russians colluded with Trump to steal the election.
[03:42:18.416 --> 03:42:20.759]  That's a left-wing conspiracy theory.
[03:42:20.759 --> 03:42:21.760]  It's nutty.
[03:42:21.760 --> 03:42:23.141]  There's no evidence of it.
[03:42:23.141 --> 03:42:25.664]  They just keep saying it over and over again.
[03:42:25.664 --> 03:42:28.226]  I feel sorry for these conspiracy theorists.
[03:42:28.226 --> 03:42:30.309]  They must be very unhappy people.
[03:42:30.309 --> 03:42:32.111]  All right, I want you to get to your guests.
[03:42:32.111 --> 03:42:34.373]  I just barely plugged the last three and a half hours.
[03:42:34.373 --> 03:42:35.374]  I need listeners to understand.
[03:42:35.374 --> 03:42:36.675]  You want people to fight?
[03:42:37.506 --> 03:42:38.626]  We're fighting.
[03:42:38.626 --> 03:42:49.248]  And I know you've been supporting us, but if you just sign up for AutoShip, you get an additional 10% off on things like the coffee, or things like the Methylcobalamin Secret 12, or things like the Brain Force.

[03:42:50.889 --> 03:42:53.789]  If you sign up for AutoShip, you get an additional 10% off.
[03:42:53.789 --> 03:42:56.050]  That funds the operation.
[03:42:56.050 --> 03:42:58.550]  You are the lifeblood.
[03:42:58.550 --> 03:43:02.291]  The children's fluoride-free toothpaste that's so good is back in.
[03:43:03.561 --> 03:43:05.347]  The children's super blue.
[03:43:05.347 --> 03:43:07.114]  We now have the Dr. Jones approved.
[03:43:08.172 --> 03:43:17.095]  Super, not me, my dad is the doctor, fluoride-free, super blue mouthwash with iodine, colloidal silver, peppermint, and tea tree oil.
[03:43:17.095 --> 03:43:18.855]  The number one recommended mouthwash by Alex Jones.
[03:43:18.855 --> 03:43:24.657]  We also have the 10 to 1 by Emrix Essentials that's excellent but doesn't have the iodine or colloidal silver, but it's excellent as well.
[03:43:24.657 --> 03:43:29.198]  Purchase it at InfowarsStore.com exclusively and help fund our operation.
[03:43:29.198 --> 03:43:35.921]  Now back to Roger Stone of Infowars and StoneColdTruth.com.
[03:43:35.921 --> 03:43:36.561]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:43:37.848 --> 03:43:42.251]  I think a golden opportunity was lost this week.
[03:43:42.251 --> 03:43:48.755]  The Republicans in Congress have done everything humanly possible to thwart the President's program.
[03:43:48.755 --> 03:44:05.005]  And the special election in Alabama afforded the President an excellent opportunity to send a clear message to his Republican opponents that he will go to the mat with those who refuse to support the reform agenda.
[03:44:06.093 --> 03:44:19.024]  Unfortunately, shockingly, yesterday, the President endorsed the appointed Senator, Luther Strange, who has the support of Mitch McConnell.
[03:44:19.024 --> 03:44:24.029]  While I have huge respect for the President, perhaps he's unaware of the fact that Luther Strange
[03:44:25.214 --> 03:44:39.650]  As Attorney General of Alabama, corruptly and unethically held a criminal investigation over the head of disgraced and outgoing Governor Bentley to obtain his appointment to the Senate.
[03:44:40.419 --> 03:44:57.127]  Perhaps the president is unaware of the fact that Luther Strange wants to keep the Senate's 60% rule that empowers Chuck Schumer and the Democrats to kill the entire conservative Republican Trump reform agenda.
[03:44:57.127 --> 03:44:57.567]  Perhaps.
[03:44:58.217 --> 03:45:22.221]  The President is unaware of the fact that Luther Strange took a $50,000 contribution from a heavy polluter as a reward for sending two letters to the EPA blocking an investigation of the polluter and preventing them from paying the cleanup costs of pollution of the inner city areas of Birmingham.
[03:45:22.221 --> 03:45:24.381]  This is really extraordinary.
[03:45:24.381 --> 03:45:27.502]  Luther Strange is no friend of the President.
[03:45:28.291 --> 03:45:50.127]  Also in that race is Congressman Mo Brooks, who does not admit that he was named after Mo of the Three Stooges, and who is a virulent never-Trumper, who not only attacked Trump before he was the nominee, attacked him while he was the nominee, but also attacked him only weeks ago in this primary.
[03:45:51.275 --> 03:45:59.166]  The good news is there is a Trump supporter in this race, Dr. Randy Brinson, who joins me now.
[03:45:59.166 --> 03:46:02.090]  Dr. Brinson, welcome to InfoWars.
[03:46:02.090 --> 03:46:03.372]  Well, thank you so much, Roger.
[03:46:03.372 --> 03:46:04.894]  I appreciate this opportunity to be with you.
[03:46:06.908 --> 03:46:16.054]  As you know, I am deeply disappointed in the President's decision or the decision that was foisted upon him by Mitch McConnell.
[03:46:16.054 --> 03:46:24.479]  I think he had a golden opportunity to show the Senate Republicans that he's not going to stand for their obstruction and they're undermining his program.
[03:46:24.479 --> 03:46:28.742]  You are the only candidate in this race who is actually for Donald Trump.
[03:46:29.489 --> 03:46:39.052]  I should note that former Supreme Court Justice Roy Moore, who's a good man, is in the race, but all of the polls show that he cannot win this race.
[03:46:39.052 --> 03:46:47.335]  He will lose the race, as he had all of his previous statewide races, once he gets into a runoff.
[03:46:47.335 --> 03:46:56.598]  The idea of a runoff between Mo Brooks and Luther Strange boggles the mind to Never Trumpers who cannot be counted on to support the president.
[03:46:57.510 --> 03:47:10.018]  Why don't you walk through, people, the scandal regarding Luther Strange, presumably Attorney General Sessions, and why we are where we are today.
[03:47:10.018 --> 03:47:13.480]  Well, it's a very convoluted path, as you know, Roger.
[03:47:13.480 --> 03:47:25.568]  First of all, Luther Strange has two ethics violations pending with the Ethics Commission that was filed not by a candidate, but the Secretary of State, for campaign finance violations.
[03:47:26.511 --> 03:47:27.472]  So those are pending.
[03:47:27.472 --> 03:47:32.935]  And so what happened was they were supposed to answer on those complaints.
[03:47:32.935 --> 03:47:36.658]  And the Ethics Commission decided to go take a vacation.
[03:47:36.658 --> 03:47:38.519]  One of them went off to Canada.
[03:47:38.519 --> 03:47:40.541]  And so they put it off till after the election.
[03:47:40.541 --> 03:47:42.562]  That's unheard of.
[03:47:42.562 --> 03:47:43.563]  So we have that pending.
[03:47:43.563 --> 03:47:51.448]  So he could potentially be in the runoff and then be removed or disqualified from the ballot because of this ethics violation.
[03:47:51.448 --> 03:47:55.411]  The more serious one, even on top of that, is this with the Superfund.
[03:47:56.612 --> 03:48:17.069]  He basically did the bidding of Drum & Coal, not once but twice, got campaign finance payments right after that, the tune of $25,000 each, and basically blocked the EPA from cleaning up the site, of which the state of Alabama already agreed they would go along with the cleanup.
[03:48:17.069 --> 03:48:22.994]  And the reason he did that is because Drum & Coal and others would have to pay the fines for the cleanup.
[03:48:24.016 --> 03:48:40.129]  And now we see on top of that this recent article now by Adam Zagorin that maps out the whole connection between Walsh and Bingham Law Firm, who is another big contributor to Alabama campaigns and Alabama politics, including Luther Strange.
[03:48:40.869 --> 03:48:48.215]  And I think somehow Senator Sessions, even though he's a good man, these people that he's surrounded, that give him money, are not good people.
[03:48:48.215 --> 03:48:49.616]  And that's the problem.
[03:48:49.616 --> 03:48:52.818]  I think Senator Sessions trusted people that aren't to be trusted.
[03:48:52.818 --> 03:48:53.919]  And that's the problem.
[03:48:53.919 --> 03:48:57.741]  And many of them have been implicated with connections to Balsham Bingham.
[03:48:57.741 --> 03:49:00.423]  And that needs to be investigated, including the U.S.
[03:49:00.423 --> 03:49:01.924]  Attorney that's a designee.
[03:49:01.924 --> 03:49:06.808]  So all these things are just a big wash of corruption, and that's what we need to try to delve into.
[03:49:07.428 --> 03:49:17.074]  I truly believe that Donald Trump, this president, was probably told that he feared Mo Brooks might get the nomination, or at least be in the runoff, and he didn't want that to happen.
[03:49:17.074 --> 03:49:18.734]  So that's why he did what he did.
[03:49:18.734 --> 03:49:21.396]  But he got only half the information.
[03:49:21.396 --> 03:49:30.161]  He didn't get the whole information that I was running, that the Trump Nation is behind me, and all of his supporters are behind me, and that's the person that's a real reformer in this election.
[03:49:32.229 --> 03:49:42.363]  Well, you are, of course, a former chairman of the Alabama Christian Coalition, active in your church and a Bible-believing evangelical Christian.
[03:49:42.363 --> 03:49:44.326]  You're an early Trump supporter.
[03:49:44.326 --> 03:49:46.609]  You've been endorsed by Citizens for Trump.
[03:49:47.450 --> 03:49:52.795]  Uh, and for my many critics out there, no, I have no financial relationship with Randy Brinson.
[03:49:52.795 --> 03:49:55.617]  No, I am not a consultant to his campaign.
[03:49:55.617 --> 03:49:59.140]  I have only one race, uh, horse in this race.
[03:49:59.140 --> 03:50:01.182]  Randy Brinson's a friend of mine.
[03:50:01.182 --> 03:50:02.043]  He's a good man.
[03:50:02.663 --> 03:50:03.964]  He supports the President.
[03:50:03.964 --> 03:50:06.364]  And we're digging out all the swamp creatures.
[03:50:06.364 --> 03:50:07.685]  We're digging out the swamp creatures.
[03:50:07.685 --> 03:50:08.565]  I'm sitting here watching.
[03:50:08.565 --> 03:50:11.946]  We're digging out the swamp creatures and trying to get rid of the establishment Republicans.
[03:50:11.946 --> 03:50:13.167]  That's our real revolution.
[03:50:13.167 --> 03:50:14.607]  The Democrats, we're not going to fix them.
[03:50:14.607 --> 03:50:17.388]  They're totally mentally ill and on another planet.
[03:50:17.388 --> 03:50:19.369]  But the Republican Party is the real fight.
[03:50:19.369 --> 03:50:21.369]  That's where we've got the beachhead.
[03:50:21.369 --> 03:50:30.853]  And we've got to start supporting the grassroots, hard chargers, not more establishment swamp creatures that have been in the baby swamps to then be sent to the big daddy swamps.
[03:50:30.853 --> 03:50:31.353]  Sorry, go ahead.
[03:50:32.694 --> 03:50:33.855]  Look, let's be very clear.
[03:50:33.855 --> 03:50:37.376]  Luther Strange is Mitch McConnell's bitch.
[03:50:37.376 --> 03:50:41.498]  He will vote against the President when Mitch McConnell directs it to.
[03:50:41.498 --> 03:50:47.722]  One of the biggest problems in Washington today is that Republicans don't fear the President anymore.
[03:50:47.722 --> 03:50:51.583]  It's been a long time since he's taken a liberal Republican scalp.
[03:50:51.583 --> 03:51:00.568]  And therefore they now believe you can flout the President, you can undermine him, you can even attack him as Mitch McConnell did yesterday, and he will do nothing.
[03:51:01.349 --> 03:51:06.691]  Alabama was a unique opportunity to show that that's not the case.
[03:51:06.691 --> 03:51:13.873]  I believe if Luther Strange makes the runoff, he may get removed because of his looming ethical problems.
[03:51:13.873 --> 03:51:15.474]  There is one solid
[03:51:16.334 --> 03:51:22.277]  Bible-based, Trump-supporting, conservative in this race, who will stand up for the Trump agenda.
[03:51:22.277 --> 03:51:24.277]  And that is my friend, Randy Brinson.
[03:51:24.277 --> 03:51:25.298]  Let's expand on that.
[03:51:25.298 --> 03:51:29.220]  We don't want to send anybody there with any hint of corruption.
[03:51:29.220 --> 03:51:30.780]  Bottom line, because we're good people.
[03:51:30.780 --> 03:51:34.282]  But plus, exactly, don't send a scalp to the Democrats.
[03:51:34.282 --> 03:51:36.963]  Don't send somebody with a crooked toenail up there.
[03:51:36.963 --> 03:51:41.185]  We don't want to send career politicians with all their dirt there for multiple reasons.
[03:51:41.185 --> 03:51:43.386]  We don't want to give them a whole nother scandal.
[03:51:45.875 --> 03:51:49.538]  So, Dr. Brinson, how do you feel about... Go ahead.
[03:51:49.538 --> 03:51:51.219]  Well, here's the thing.
[03:51:51.219 --> 03:51:53.401]  You nailed it, both you and Alex.
[03:51:53.401 --> 03:51:55.223]  But here's even more important.
[03:51:55.223 --> 03:52:00.827]  I have the only plan that can pass with Democrat-Republican votes for Obamacare replacement.
[03:52:01.287 --> 03:52:03.109]  If we don't, all we want to do is just repeal.
[03:52:03.109 --> 03:52:06.911]  If we don't have our votes to repeal, then we have to have a plan to put in place.
[03:52:06.911 --> 03:52:15.678]  And we have that plan in place that will cap Medicaid spending, create competition for Medicaid patients to take care of them, and that will actually work.
[03:52:15.678 --> 03:52:17.379]  And we can use that model in Alabama.
[03:52:17.939 --> 03:52:19.220]  Throughout the nation.
[03:52:19.220 --> 03:52:20.240]  I just want the opportunity.
[03:52:20.240 --> 03:52:25.663]  I'm challenging the White House to let me go meet with the President and his advisors to show them this plan.
[03:52:25.663 --> 03:52:30.165]  And I promise you that that thing will get through Congress if we allow that to go forward.
[03:52:30.165 --> 03:52:31.826]  That's very important.
[03:52:31.826 --> 03:52:35.288]  Otherwise, we're going to go bankrupt with Obamacare in the next six to eight months.
[03:52:35.288 --> 03:52:36.989]  And then you lose all your majorities.
[03:52:36.989 --> 03:52:39.550]  We'll be voted out because of inaction by the Republican leadership.
[03:52:41.628 --> 03:52:57.177]  Not only that, but of course if we lose control of the House, well then, they'll use a trumped-up phony charge cooked up by Mr. Mueller to remove our president, and Mitch McConnell will stand on the sidelines and do nothing, probably applaud, actually.
[03:52:57.177 --> 03:53:05.162]  So, tell us the date of the special election in Alabama, and tell me how you feel about the campaign trail.
[03:53:05.879 --> 03:53:08.821]  Well, August 15th is the big day, Roger.
[03:53:08.821 --> 03:53:10.883]  That's next Tuesday.
[03:53:10.883 --> 03:53:12.564]  We're right in the thick of it.
[03:53:12.564 --> 03:53:14.405]  You can't poll an election like this.
[03:53:14.405 --> 03:53:19.889]  If you're being serious, you can't poll it because it's going to be a low turnout, middle of the summer election.
[03:53:19.889 --> 03:53:23.552]  People are going to be at the beach or the lake or somewhere on that Tuesday, as many of them.
[03:53:23.552 --> 03:53:25.374]  So it's going to be the hardcore people.
[03:53:25.374 --> 03:53:27.475]  And those are the people that usually support me.
[03:53:27.475 --> 03:53:31.778]  So if they don't get discouraged, this is all to discourage turnout and discourage our people.
[03:53:32.899 --> 03:53:34.100]  The Trump people turn out.
[03:53:34.100 --> 03:53:35.421]  The Trump Nation turns out.
[03:53:35.421 --> 03:53:36.281]  Citizen for Trump.
[03:53:36.281 --> 03:53:38.623]  And the people that supported Trump's agenda.
[03:53:38.623 --> 03:53:40.364]  We can still win this race.
[03:53:40.364 --> 03:53:42.846]  Because we've got the ideas.
[03:53:42.846 --> 03:53:45.748]  We've got the reason to actually have some.
[03:53:45.748 --> 03:53:46.228]  That's right.
[03:53:46.228 --> 03:53:47.609]  Trump's not fighting alone.
[03:53:47.609 --> 03:53:49.010]  We're out there fighting.
[03:53:49.010 --> 03:53:51.932]  And when the swamp has a victory, we can grab that away from them.
[03:53:51.932 --> 03:53:57.396]  You know, grab that victory right out of their jaws and give it to ourselves and the American people and the future.
[03:53:57.396 --> 03:54:01.899]  If we get the word out that all over the country, races like this, that when the swamp
[03:54:02.279 --> 03:54:04.806]  You know, tricks Trump into endorsing somebody, it's okay.
[03:54:04.806 --> 03:54:06.409]  We all just go against the swamp.
[03:54:08.010 --> 03:54:09.951]  Yeah, exactly right.
[03:54:09.951 --> 03:54:10.551]  Exactly right.
[03:54:10.551 --> 03:54:11.731]  That's what we need to do.
[03:54:11.731 --> 03:54:14.072]  And the thing is, we just got to fight back, Alex and Roger.
[03:54:14.072 --> 03:54:16.833]  We got to fight back with all this misinformation.
[03:54:16.833 --> 03:54:20.255]  I think the president was misinformed intentionally.
[03:54:20.255 --> 03:54:22.015]  I think it was intentionally misinformed.
[03:54:22.015 --> 03:54:29.538]  And if we can get the president's ear, even at this late hour, I think he can see he can take his own heads about who were giving him wrong information.
[03:54:29.538 --> 03:54:31.019]  That's been the whole problem with the White House.
[03:54:31.019 --> 03:54:33.380]  He's trusting people because he's a trusting person.
[03:54:33.900 --> 03:54:42.285]  And he's trusting the wrong people to give him misinformation to try to discredit and get their way instead of doing what really needs to be happening for the American people.
[03:54:42.285 --> 03:54:44.287]  You know, it's really extraordinary.
[03:54:44.287 --> 03:54:58.756]  Since the beginning of this broadcast, my cell phone has rung twice with a call from a heavy-duty Washington lobbyist who sent me a text saying, Drop Brinson can get you paid by Strange immediately.
[03:54:59.705 --> 03:55:01.507]  This is what we're up against.
[03:55:01.507 --> 03:55:06.450]  This is the kind of crap that goes on in the swamp.
[03:55:06.450 --> 03:55:21.922]  I happen to know in the case of Randy's campaign, Dr. Brinson's campaign, the first five Republican pollsters he attempted to retain to help him analyze the race were all pressured out of working for him by none other than Mitch McConnell.
[03:55:22.532 --> 03:55:25.235]  So this is an inside game.
[03:55:25.235 --> 03:55:36.126]  There is only one Trump supporter and solid evangelical Christian conservative who can win this race and beat the Democrats, and that's Dr. Randy Brinson.
[03:55:36.126 --> 03:55:39.550]  Dr. Brinson, thanks for joining us here at InfoWars.
[03:55:39.550 --> 03:55:41.072]  Thank you, Alex, and thank you, Roger.
[03:55:41.072 --> 03:55:41.913]  Appreciate everything.
[03:55:41.913 --> 03:55:43.915]  Appreciate all you do for the American people.
[03:55:46.610 --> 03:55:55.941]  Moving along, I must say I just looked at the $17.76 specials at the Infowars store and it blows me away.
[03:55:55.941 --> 03:56:03.049]  Mrs. Stone is particularly happy that the new Super Blue Fluoride Mouthwash can be had for $17.76.
[03:56:06.058 --> 03:56:14.984]  She started using this right after she started using the Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste, which is now a real favorite in the Stone household.
[03:56:14.984 --> 03:56:18.527]  My grandson, Nicholas, has actually stolen mine.
[03:56:18.527 --> 03:56:21.909]  I have to order more because he liked mine so much.
[03:56:21.909 --> 03:56:23.350]  Well, he took it.
[03:56:23.350 --> 03:56:26.973]  But if you look at these prices, folks, they will blow you away.
[03:56:27.791 --> 03:56:33.713]  Brain Force, which I assure you is absolutely necessary for me to do this show.
[03:56:33.713 --> 03:56:36.594]  What is it about kids stealing your toiletries?
[03:56:36.594 --> 03:56:41.835]  My son never steals anything but my razors and my deodorant and my toothpaste.
[03:56:41.835 --> 03:56:45.737]  He uses my bathroom like Walgreens.
[03:56:45.737 --> 03:56:46.577]  What is it about that?
[03:56:46.977 --> 03:56:49.079]  They're like raccoons.
[03:56:49.079 --> 03:56:54.883]  I go to Papa Brain Force because I have to write a paper or do a conference call, and it's not there.
[03:56:54.883 --> 03:56:58.326]  When I asked my grandson Nick what happened, he said, oh, I had to work yesterday.
[03:56:58.326 --> 03:56:58.686]  I took it.
[03:56:59.525 --> 03:57:05.430]  So, I guess they feel a license, but they ought to go on the site and buy their own.
[03:57:05.430 --> 03:57:07.832]  Rainforce, 55% off.
[03:57:07.832 --> 03:57:09.874]  That's never happened before.
[03:57:09.874 --> 03:57:13.757]  Survival Shield X2, 55% off.
[03:57:13.757 --> 03:57:16.679]  Secret 12, 55% off.
[03:57:16.679 --> 03:57:19.822]  Oil of Oregano, 40% off.
[03:57:19.822 --> 03:57:25.026]  Alex, you have cut prices to the bone here with some of your best products.
[03:57:25.026 --> 03:57:28.489]  And I agree with some of you said earlier, buy with the good guys.
[03:57:29.218 --> 03:57:34.082]  When you support the InfoWars store, you support the fight for freedom.
[03:57:34.082 --> 03:57:38.366]  You support the fight against the never-truthers and the globalists.
[03:57:38.366 --> 03:57:39.527]  We're not just saying that.
[03:57:39.527 --> 03:57:43.050]  We have them all coming after us because you are the InfoWars.
[03:57:44.691 --> 03:57:51.594]  The summer is always a very, very dead time for sales wise in talk radio period, but I've already just been cutting things more and more.
[03:57:51.594 --> 03:57:54.936]  I mean, because we don't like raise prices and then have 55% off.
[03:57:54.936 --> 03:57:56.796]  I mean, this is 55% off.
[03:57:56.796 --> 03:57:57.817]  The price is always the same.
[03:57:57.817 --> 03:57:58.377]  People see that.
[03:57:58.377 --> 03:58:01.899]  So we do discounts and we're doing this because we found we bring in even more money.
[03:58:02.759 --> 03:58:04.520]  Well, we cut it down to almost nothing.
[03:58:04.520 --> 03:58:12.125]  But I'll tell you, some of these are lost leaders when you sign up for AutoShip and get an additional 10% off, especially the 50% off on the silver products.
[03:58:12.125 --> 03:58:16.508]  That baby is a lost leader right there without that even happening, but we're doing it.
[03:58:16.508 --> 03:58:17.289]  Roger, amazing.
[03:58:17.289 --> 03:58:18.129]  Thanks for letting me go.
[03:58:18.129 --> 03:58:23.293]  It's fun to be able to eat my late lunch, you know, and then kind of just pop in here obnoxiously.
[03:58:23.293 --> 03:58:23.793]  So thank you.
[03:58:23.793 --> 03:58:25.915]  We're all in this together, my friend.
[03:58:25.915 --> 03:58:28.316]  And so a lot more will be breaking, I know, in the next few days.
[03:58:28.316 --> 03:58:32.199]  Look forward to having you right here with InfoWars coming up in early September with the launch of your own
[03:58:33.160 --> 03:58:36.864]  Weekday transmission, so thank you so much, Roger.
[03:58:36.864 --> 03:58:39.627]  Alex, victory or death?
[03:58:39.627 --> 03:58:41.209]  That's right, they'll never take us alive.
[03:58:41.209 --> 03:58:43.071]  We mean that figuratively, you know, politically.
[03:58:43.071 --> 03:58:44.252]  We're never giving up.
[03:58:44.252 --> 03:58:44.873]  No surrender.
