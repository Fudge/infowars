[00:00.000 --> 00:15.660]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show this message is transmitted at the
[00:15.660 --> 00:19.460]  request with the president of the United States of America and the office of
[00:19.460 --> 00:23.580]  Homeland Security in compliance with the United Nations the president of the
[00:23.580 --> 00:43.580]  United States has declared martial law. Curfee is now in place return to your homes and congregate with two more people outside of your homes who will result in you being arrested on site. If you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance. It's the Alex Jones show.
[00:53.580 --> 01:17.580]  He has been very threatening beyond a normal state and as I said they will be met with fire, fury and frankly power the likes of which this world has never seen before.
[01:17.580 --> 01:38.580]  Ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us on this Wednesday the 9th day of August 2017. I'm your host Alex Jones and I am not even going to get into the North Korea situation until we start the next segment because it's so dire.
[01:38.580 --> 01:50.580]  Top British newspapers the top two papers in the UK are telling the public prepare for nuclear war and directing them with a location of fallout shelters.
[01:50.580 --> 02:14.580]  Now there's a lot of Machiavellian angles to all of this that we're also going to be looking at. The bottom line is this beyond McMasters and others who have been pushing for conflict with North Korea as a distraction from the fact that their coup inside the White House has been discovered.
[02:14.580 --> 02:33.580]  Separate from all of that that doesn't take away from the fact that Kim Jong-un is completely delusional and out of his mind and just as bad as the corrupt globalists that we see plaguing our culture and our civilization.
[02:33.580 --> 02:52.580]  And of course the big nuclear weapon in the room the big elephant is the Clintons and the globalist and their strategy of giving nuclear weapons and delivery systems to Kim Jong-un's father Kim Jong-il.
[02:52.580 --> 03:07.580]  So really we should be discussing the globalist policies of strategic tension as they call it that have brought us to this point.
[03:07.580 --> 03:12.580]  But there is no good guys and bad guys in this situation.
[03:12.580 --> 03:22.580]  When it comes to the gods of the state North Korea is a purist and is an absolute nightmare hellhole with their poor people.
[03:22.580 --> 03:33.580]  But in many cases being killed in a nuclear blast if you're in a forced labor camp being worked to death and tortured to death would probably some type of reprieve.
[03:33.580 --> 03:45.580]  I'm not saying I want to see a strike on North Korea. War is not beautiful it's not elegant it's not something that is to be celebrated.
[03:45.580 --> 03:52.580]  But Kim Jong-un is continually threatening to nuke Seoul South Korea Tokyo Japan.
[03:52.580 --> 04:02.580]  Now he's threatening preemptive strikes against Guam where we've got B-52s nukes you name it cruise missiles.
[04:02.580 --> 04:14.580]  And they've got a wide range of missiles that can now hit easily as far east as Chicago Illinois or Austin Texas.
[04:14.580 --> 04:27.580]  Depends on how you look at it it's the other side of the world you could say as far west or as far east but they would be firing their weapons at the eastern seaboard they'd be firing in that direction.
[04:27.580 --> 04:39.580]  Merkel orders Trump calm down as North Korea crisis peaks over Guam threat. See the media singing in all of them are acting like it's Donald Trump's fault.
[04:39.580 --> 04:53.580]  And I'm not here as an apologist to Donald Trump but North Korea is continually saying we're going to have fire we're going to have death we're going to rain down destruction on you we're going to kill you we're going to turn the United States into a molten nuclear war zone.
[04:53.580 --> 05:06.580]  And Trump comes back with one little smidgen back of that back trying something new as the Secretary of State pointed out and the media acts like he gave the nuclear weapons to North Korea.
[05:24.580 --> 05:35.580]  But the grasshoppers will still sing the tune if they can make money. But maybe you don't have a Hollywood mansion where you can drop another million dollars to turn your home theater into a radiation proof bunker.
[05:35.580 --> 05:47.580]  There are still very effective low tech low cost things you can do to prepare. In fact even realizing that there's a need to prepare and doing anything to act on that realization increases your chances of survival.
[05:47.580 --> 05:55.580]  Things that you do to prepare for an Armageddon scenario will help you to weather storms to absorb an economic shock or to protect you from home invasion.
[05:55.580 --> 06:01.580]  Prepare for the worst case scenario while you educate yourself and others and work for the best case scenario.
[06:01.580 --> 06:18.580]  Get more information at info wars dot com. I'm David Knight.
[06:32.580 --> 06:41.580]  Pathogens added to the food and water and the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.

[08:13.580 --> 08:28.580]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Commence Center in the heart of the resistance rallying Patriots worldwide.
[08:28.580 --> 08:43.580]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[08:43.580 --> 09:01.580]  Hey you live in interesting times the old Chinese proverb it's Wednesday already the ninth day of August 2017 and it's at times like this that I don't even like being separated from my children.
[09:01.580 --> 09:18.580]  It's at times like this that I really don't want to go out of town. It's at times like this that I realize how mortal I am and how mortal my family is and how mortal this planet is life on this planet.
[09:18.580 --> 09:32.580]  And that history repeats itself history also tends to go in cycles. History rhymes.
[09:32.580 --> 09:38.580]  And if you look at the war that ended back on July 27th 1953, it never officially ended.
[09:38.580 --> 09:45.580]  They're on the DMZ between the North Korea and South Korea.
[09:45.580 --> 09:59.580]  This is the type of day though where I want to open the phones up for all of you to be able to chime in and give your response particularly if you're in the military or been in Korea or in Japan or in China or in Guam.
[09:59.580 --> 10:02.580]  But everybody's a target of this.
[10:02.580 --> 10:25.580]  But the Korean War the UN police action came to a cease fire. July 27 1953. Millions died in that war. Millions, including over 100,000 Americans.
[10:25.580 --> 10:48.580]  And now we have a psychotic global elite that gave reactors in North Korea allowing them to produce atomic warheads and missile secrets that the communist Chinese wouldn't even give to them.
[10:48.580 --> 11:03.580]  And the strategy of tension was this if the West needed an excuse to ever go to war with red China as it was properly called back in the 1950s and 60s and 70s and 80s till the political correctness came along.
[11:03.580 --> 11:15.580]  We're supposed to not call it that anymore with their one child policy and their forced abortions and the execution of Christians and harvesting their organs and fall on gong and all the rest of it.
[11:15.580 --> 11:19.580]  But despite that warming towards China.
[11:19.580 --> 11:24.580]  The strategy of tension continued and that's why North Korea was left there.
[11:24.580 --> 11:26.580]  That's why it's sitting there.
[11:26.580 --> 11:35.580]  Douglas MacArthur wanted to drop atomic bombs on the Chinese troops 3 million of them that came over the Yellow River.
[11:35.580 --> 11:49.580]  When President Truman told him no, the old soldier that never died but just faded away as he said old soldiers never die.
[11:49.580 --> 11:51.580]  They just fade away.
[11:51.580 --> 11:57.580]  He was removed from command.
[11:57.580 --> 12:10.580]  And the Chinese were backed up by Russia who threatened nuclear war if we repulse the attack with atomic bombs.
[12:10.580 --> 12:15.580]  And why did the Soviets have atomic bombs and we're about to get the hydrogen bomb?
[12:15.580 --> 12:25.580]  Because our government, our deep state, the same folks that worked on the Manhattan Project, used the Rosenbergs as the cutout.
[12:25.580 --> 12:33.580]  This has all been declassified to transfer the atomic weapons technology to the Russians.
[12:33.580 --> 12:48.580]  They had superior scientists in their own ranks and from the Germans when it came to missile delivery, payload delivery, but not when it came to the bombs themselves.
[12:48.580 --> 13:01.580]  So the globalist, so he'd accepted you in and world government for world peace, transferred nuclear weapons to Russia, then to China and continued.
[13:01.580 --> 13:12.580]  You don't just think the Clintons did that in the 1990s as part of some thing they thought up to get a few million dollars into their foundation from North Korea, which they got.
[13:12.580 --> 13:15.580]  You don't just think that they did it on their own.
[13:15.580 --> 13:21.580]  They were authorized to do it. So I'm breaking down, ladies and gentlemen, not just the current crisis, but why we're in it.
[13:21.580 --> 13:30.580]  Why North Korea is threatening a preemptive strike against Guam, against Hawaii, against Seattle, against Chicago, against LA.
[13:30.580 --> 13:34.580]  These are all being listed.
[13:34.580 --> 13:44.580]  Because our crazy elites propped up the grandfather of the current little demon that sits there.
[13:44.580 --> 13:53.580]  Even the New York Times admits the Clintons armed North Korea, but it's beyond that the Clintons are scapegoats and they're horrible scapegoats.
[13:53.580 --> 14:04.580]  They're guilty, but they themselves are puppets.
[14:04.580 --> 14:21.580]  We have psychotic elite and control that transferred weapons to Russia and transferred weapons to China and transferred weapons in North Korea and transferred weapons to everybody else.
[14:21.580 --> 14:31.580]  Because the globalist want ordered controlled cult like states of absolutely servile brainwashed minions.
[14:31.580 --> 14:42.580]  And since yesterday afternoon, I've just been giddy with the energy in the air as this escalation went stratospheric.
[14:42.580 --> 15:04.580]  And now I basically had the most unsettling dreams all last night, sickening dreams all last night, deeply having sorrow for my children and the potentiality that is becoming a probability of worldwide nuclear war.
[15:04.580 --> 15:13.580]  And Joe Scowson will tell you and he's dialed into the smartest guys out there. He's one of them. He's a smart guy. He agrees that they are planning a nuclear war.
[15:13.580 --> 15:24.580]  And that he's moved his timetable up to this year or next year now instead of 2020. And he's been saying that for 15 years and it's coming true.
[15:24.580 --> 15:39.580]  So that's all. It's easy to get mad at the TSA, groping little kids. But then you got to ask why Congress passed a law, even the borders opened Orthodox Muslims, letting them come in on terror networks, then letting them attack and then taking all of our rights.
[15:39.580 --> 15:45.580]  I'm not going to blame the little TSA person anymore. I'm going to blame myself, Congress, the American people for letting it happen.
[15:45.580 --> 15:56.580]  And it's the same thing. We consider and blame North Korea all day. Most of the people there are total slaves, absolutely in the most hellish environment on earth in forced labor camps.
[15:56.580 --> 16:11.580]  Something like a third of the population is in forced labor camps where the morals are so whacked out and twisted that there's rules against raping a woman.
[16:11.580 --> 16:20.580]  So they'll rape the woman and then kill her.
[16:20.580 --> 16:32.580]  And the reports of where the people are so tough there that they'll chop their legs off for fun. The entertainment is just torturing people. And then people survive sometimes years.
[16:32.580 --> 16:46.580]  Their legs heal and they just crawl around with no legs working in the fields.
[16:46.580 --> 16:53.580]  And so you can think maybe raining down hydrogen bombs on North Korea would be a gift to some people, but no, it's not. We can't play God.
[16:53.580 --> 16:58.580]  And here's the bigger issue. Here's the big takeaway from all of it.
[16:58.580 --> 17:15.580]  The globalists set this up and did this. Our evil elites in Europe, the United States and the UK created communism, propped it up, put it in, gave them all the weapons, gave them our jobs, gave them our industry to prop it up.
[17:15.580 --> 17:24.580]  And we're not facing North Korea. We're facing China.
[17:24.580 --> 17:32.580]  And in the new strategy, Trump was trying to get China to leave the strategy of tension and to stop it and to reform and Russia.
[17:32.580 --> 17:42.580]  But the neocons and the globalists and the Democrats blocked Trump from his true JFK level peace move.
[17:42.580 --> 17:57.580]  Now, in this incredibly dangerous situation where we face China and Russia, things are deteriorating quicker in disputes all along the 800 mile border with India and China.
[17:57.580 --> 18:09.580]  As India and China grab pieces of property from each other that's been disputed for a century and say they've gone to their highest level before they go into full war, which they've had wars before and both powers are nuclear.
[18:09.580 --> 18:17.580]  And the Indians didn't need help developing atomic weapons.
[18:17.580 --> 18:41.580]  Pakistan was given it again, allowed to by AQCon laboratories under who again, Bill and Hillary Clinton, same players, same people, same groups, but Donald Rumsfeld was involved with ABB and other companies in the transfers to Korea, North Korea and Pakistan.
[18:41.580 --> 18:50.580]  And once the Pakistanis had the basic materials, they've built hundreds of weapons. They didn't need a lot of help, did they?
[18:50.580 --> 18:57.580]  So that's where we stand. We're going to skip this network break. That's where we stand on the precipice right now.
[18:57.580 --> 19:08.580]  And so it's not just, oh, Kim Jong-il's a horrible little dictator, pig-like creature. I agree. He's nauseating. Those people, he's got under a stinking thumb.
[19:08.580 --> 19:15.580]  I'd like to see him get his neck broken. And a lot of people would obviously, but transcending that, this is what evil puts on the throne.
[19:15.580 --> 19:23.580]  This is what the devil's got in store for this planet under the state god that everybody's pushing so hard for.
[19:23.580 --> 19:41.580]  He's going to deliver us into this Valhalla, into the golden pelaner fields of Elysium. But once you travel to Elysium, you find it's more like hell. The Greek 80s and the heaven, we were supposedly going to be transported to.
[19:41.580 --> 20:00.580]  The Christian free market, open free will ethos is the fount of success and the fount of transcendence. And the enemy is seeking to pull it down with every ugly, stunted, wicked ideology of Islam, of communism.
[20:00.580 --> 20:10.580]  Force feeding it with an icing of sexualization and pedophilia against our children.
[20:10.580 --> 20:23.580]  I should probably get a live mic in here and just walk over to the world map. I've got section by section here of the continents and the countries and point out the grand strategies, the grand chessboard.
[20:23.580 --> 20:32.580]  We're putting in a new studio with TV walls twice the size of what we've got in here so I can walk with PowerPoint and show people in daily briefings what we're dealing with here.
[20:32.580 --> 20:44.580]  We can properly go over this for folks because on screen and on the walls and all around this is the planet, the ship we're on in deep space.
[20:44.580 --> 20:52.580]  And we've got people running the ship that are pedophiles that are devil worshipers and that have handed out nuclear weapons to everybody, but it's worse.
[20:52.580 --> 21:15.580]  Now their genetic engineering is spreading. And we're out here, like if we were a science fiction movie, like some weapons colony, some weapons test, where some dangerous species has been put out in a primitive form on a planet for somebody's entertainment to watch if we can survive
[21:15.580 --> 21:25.580]  and what we do once we get to this level, we have an ancestral memory of technology, all the legends, all the information, all the understanding, the epigenetics.
[21:25.580 --> 21:36.580]  We know we've been in space. We know we're advanced. We know it's all just this memory that's there. We all know what we can build. We all know what we can do.
[21:36.580 --> 21:46.580]  And now we're sitting here on the face of this whole thing. I'll probably do it next segment. Thanks. That was quick.
[21:46.580 --> 21:56.580]  Sitting here on this planet with this incredible potential of space colonies and life extension and unlimited cloning.
[21:56.580 --> 22:11.580]  We got people running things that want Kim Jong-un in charge and who want the communist Chinese in charge. RCIA put them in power in 1949.
[22:11.580 --> 22:26.580]  And this global force wants to put dangerous, tainted vaccines where it's been discovered in the UN files. They're adding sterilants. They're adding cancer viruses. And you wonder why our life expectancy is going down. You wonder why infant mortality skyrocketing.
[22:26.580 --> 22:42.580]  You wonder why pediatric cancers are something like 15,000 times worse than they were on average, was 10,000. Diabetes, type 2, 3,000 plus increase for the 1960s. Type 1, multi-thousand increase.
[22:42.580 --> 22:57.580]  We're called genetic. We're being killed by whatever it is in charge and manipulating. And the thing in charge wants us to take microchips to buy and sell.
[22:57.580 --> 23:14.580]  It's now on the news. It's building a worldwide AI system of computers that will project its three-dimensional image into the seats of power, into the shopping malls, into the town squares.
[23:14.580 --> 23:28.580]  And we will worship the AI because it's going to know when we're going to order something from Amazon before we do. And it's going to know when we're going to get cancer before we do. And it's going to save us. But we have to give up our humanity to be saved.
[23:28.580 --> 23:34.580]  We have to give up our humanity to have a baby, but it won't be a baby.
[23:34.580 --> 23:46.580]  It'll be a new humanoid with five daddies or five mommies because you can't have a human in this new system. It can only be humanoid.
[23:46.580 --> 23:53.580]  The crime will be being male. The crime will be female. The crime will be male and female in union.
[23:53.580 --> 24:04.580]  They sold you on the sexual revolution in the free love of men and women. And then once they had you there, by successive approximation, they walked you into the gates of hell.
[24:04.580 --> 24:17.580]  Using the weapon of the open free society. Using the fact that we don't want to hurt anybody's feelings. They can successfully walk us into total genetic and cultural and species doom.
[24:17.580 --> 24:32.580]  But the doom is not reserved for just the humans. Everything will be defiled. Everything will be twisted. Everything will be mixed.
[24:32.580 --> 24:42.580]  Everything will be deformed. Everything will be made hideous and crying out for destruction.
[24:42.580 --> 24:48.580]  Before the force is allowed to finally kill everything on the planet.
[24:48.580 --> 25:00.580]  But because of free will, the life must be turned upside down and must beg for its delivery into death.
[25:00.580 --> 25:04.580]  But it will never get that far.
[25:04.580 --> 25:12.580]  Because God will spare flesh. But if God didn't intervene, there would be no flesh spared.
[25:12.580 --> 25:20.580]  You're going to look back on these days as happy days. Halcyon azure skies.
[25:20.580 --> 25:35.580]  You're going to look back on this time, screwing around, playing your video games, not fulfilling your destiny, not feeling fulfilled.
[25:35.580 --> 25:43.580]  You're going to look back and you're going to beg on your knees to God.
[25:43.580 --> 25:51.580]  That you never would have done the things you did. Those of you that serve this. But you're going to realize you don't deserve redemption in the end.
[25:51.580 --> 25:57.580]  Because you went too far and you spit in the face of life and you spit in the face of everything good.
[25:57.580 --> 26:21.580]  And you're going to turn and go the direction you meant you were destined to go because it's what you chose. And that is spiritual, cultural, genetic oblivion.
[26:21.580 --> 26:41.580]  And that's the force of oblivion. Willing itself to death, willing itself to suicide, broadcasting, screeching, howling, tornado-level freight trade.
[26:41.580 --> 26:47.580]  That's why you go out of these anti-Trump rallies. It's not that Trump's perfect, but they sense there's life force.
[26:47.580 --> 27:02.580]  They sense there's someone that doesn't want to destroy everything there. They sense there's prosperity. They sense there's something of strength, an idea of majesty, of human majesty.
[27:02.580 --> 27:18.580]  Made the image of God. That's majesty. And there's just a... hell's right there and the gates start to lift.
[27:18.580 --> 27:24.580]  And people sense it and there's a few reprieves and a few nationalist movements and Christian movements and populist movements.
[27:24.580 --> 27:33.580]  And just look what they're doing to the children. Look how they're preparing the radical Islam for us. Look at the casual society. Look at everything. Look at what they're doing.
[27:33.580 --> 27:43.580]  Look at the cancer rates. And so as the enemy comes in like a flood, the spirit of the Lord lifts up standard against it, but then the hordes of the earth cry out and say,
[27:43.580 --> 28:02.580]  No, we don't want a reprieve. We want Barabbas. We don't want Jonah. We don't want Christ. We don't want Moses. We don't want any of it.
[28:02.580 --> 28:19.580]  We want the devil. Now give us the devil. Because we're jealous and existentially angry at the goodness and the beauty.
[28:19.580 --> 28:26.580]  Because once they get you to be selfish, once they get you to be immature, once they get you to feel like you're ugly and stunted and to embrace it,
[28:26.580 --> 28:39.580]  embrace your evil side, then you see the strength and the honor and the will as twisted and as fallen.
[28:39.580 --> 28:49.580]  And then you wage war against it because the two cannot coexist. The globalists tell us coexist with them. They're not going to coexist with us.
[28:49.580 --> 29:06.580]  They're not going to let you have anything. They're going to suck your intellect out, use you, defame you, defile you, desecrate you, vandalize you before they tear you into a thousand pieces.
[29:06.580 --> 29:14.580]  And the monster tearing you to pieces is already halfway down the throat of the next big monster behind him and the next and the next and the next.
[29:14.580 --> 29:23.580]  And there at the end of the line is that old serpent Satan right there at the switch shoving his own legs right into the meat grinder.
[29:23.580 --> 29:33.580]  Well, I'm not going down that chute with him, but I'll tell you one thing. I've seen enough of the devil. I'm kind of like the devil.
[29:33.580 --> 29:45.580]  I've been there. I've seen it every night when I go to sleep. Every night. Every night I get to get my little visits.
[29:45.580 --> 30:05.580]  And it ain't a visit from old Saint Nick. The devil's real and he wants to kill me. He's visiting you every moment as well.
[30:05.580 --> 30:17.580]  December 23, 1776. These are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the Sunshine Patriot will in this crisis shrink from the service of their country.
[30:17.580 --> 30:22.580]  But he that stands by it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman.
[30:22.580 --> 30:36.580]  Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered yet we have this consolation with us that the heart of the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly. It is dearness only that gives everything its value.
[30:36.580 --> 30:44.580]  Heaven knows how to put a proper price on its goods and it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as freedom should not be highly rated.
[30:44.580 --> 30:53.580]  Britain, with an army to enforce her tyranny, has declared that she has a right not only to tax, but to bind us in all cases whatsoever.
[30:53.580 --> 31:03.580]  And if being bound in that matter is not slavery, then there is no such thing as slavery upon earth. Even the expression is impious, for so unlimited a power can only belong to God.
[31:03.580 --> 31:06.580]  Thomas Paine, The American Crisis.

[34:01.580 --> 34:07.580]  You're next, please, please, you're next, they're in danger, please, listen to me, it's something terrible.

[34:23.580 --> 34:26.580]  Elizabeth, wake up, I'll get you when you sleep, sit up.
[34:26.580 --> 34:29.580]  Invasion of the body snatchers.
[34:29.580 --> 34:33.580]  All of a sudden they're growing like parasites. Is it contagious?
[34:33.580 --> 34:35.580]  It's real, it's real, it's real.
[34:35.580 --> 34:37.580]  It looks right after it, you need to get out.
[34:37.580 --> 34:40.080]  You're looking at it as if it was human, but not human.
[34:42.080 --> 34:45.580]  Now, the classic fear begins to grow.
[34:45.580 --> 34:47.080]  We're being cornered.
[34:48.080 --> 34:51.080]  In a modern masterpiece of science fiction.
[34:51.080 --> 34:52.080]  The barricading street.
[34:53.580 --> 34:56.080]  Invasion of the body statues.
[34:56.080 --> 35:12.580]  The land of the walking dead.
[35:17.580 --> 35:21.580]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[35:22.580 --> 35:24.580]  It's Alex Jones.
[35:24.580 --> 35:33.580]  Notice the teeth of Oberman and his other counterpart floating around over there.
[35:34.580 --> 35:36.580]  Mr. Maddow, all the rest of them.
[35:37.580 --> 35:47.580]  Notice that they're now calling themselves the resistance and even using the same iconography because they are not the resistance.
[35:47.580 --> 35:49.580]  They're the globalists. They're the establishment.
[35:49.580 --> 35:59.580]  They, the man, and they represent the same scum that armed North Korea.
[35:59.580 --> 36:02.580]  It's an incontrovertible, indisputed fact, but that doesn't matter.
[36:02.580 --> 36:05.580]  The whole world's on the verge of nuclear war right now.
[36:07.580 --> 36:17.580]  It doesn't matter if North Korea every day threatens to nuke Japan, nuke South Korea, nuke the U.S., nuke the protectorate, guam,
[36:17.580 --> 36:22.580]  the possession, the territorial possession of the United States.
[36:24.580 --> 36:28.580]  The most westerly possession of the United States.
[36:28.580 --> 36:30.580]  That means you, the citizens.
[36:31.580 --> 36:33.580]  Remember we, the people, right?
[36:39.580 --> 36:42.580]  No, ladies and gentlemen, we get to hear that Paul Manafort.
[36:42.580 --> 36:52.580]  That's right. He got raided about two weeks ago on July 26th.
[36:57.580 --> 36:58.580]  Isn't that just cute?
[37:00.580 --> 37:09.580]  FBI conducted pre-dawn raid of former Trump campaign chairman Manafort's home.
[37:09.580 --> 37:16.580]  FBI agents raided the Alexandria home of President Trump's former campaign chairman late last month,
[37:16.580 --> 37:19.580]  using a search warrant to seize documents and other materials,
[37:19.580 --> 37:24.580]  according to people familiar with the special counsel investigation into Russia meddling in the 2016 election.
[37:24.580 --> 37:31.580]  From what I heard, he had agreed to send him all the documents.
[37:31.580 --> 37:33.580]  But none of it was Russian meddling.
[37:33.580 --> 37:39.580]  It was when he worked for the Ukrainian government in a pro-U.S. capacity.
[37:39.580 --> 37:43.580]  It's kind of like the other guys they've had on national TV that worked on the Trump campaign,
[37:43.580 --> 37:46.580]  who were in the CIA, you name it, propping up Yeltsin,
[37:46.580 --> 37:49.580]  and now they're getting subpoenaed and called before the committee.
[37:49.580 --> 37:52.580]  And then the committees keep it secret, won't let them release it,
[37:52.580 --> 37:55.580]  but then they leak disinfo that is it true.
[37:57.580 --> 38:00.580]  Manafort, yeah, there it is, the New York Times, had been voluntarily producing documents
[38:00.580 --> 38:06.580]  and congressional committees investigating Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election.
[38:06.580 --> 38:09.580]  So they didn't find what they needed to.
[38:11.580 --> 38:15.580]  So now they've moved on to just, like they said back in mid-July,
[38:15.580 --> 38:20.580]  oh, we're not just looking at Russia now, we're looking at checks,
[38:20.580 --> 38:22.580]  we're looking at deposits, we're looking at taxes,
[38:22.580 --> 38:27.580]  we're looking to see if anybody in the Trump entourage didn't pay all their taxes.
[38:27.580 --> 38:35.580]  Oh, a giant across the board, bigger than anything Nixon ever dreamed of, FBI IRS dragnet.
[38:37.580 --> 38:44.580]  And so Trump said, I'm gonna fire you if you get outside the stupid Russia thing
[38:44.580 --> 38:45.580]  and start some dragnet.
[38:45.580 --> 38:54.580]  The next day, the Democrat operative with 99.8% of the money his law firm gives goes to Hillary.
[38:54.580 --> 39:00.580]  Almost everybody on his little kangaroo group are Democrats, some of them fired by Trump.
[39:00.580 --> 39:03.580]  Talk about conflicts of interest from the Justice Department.
[39:03.580 --> 39:09.580]  They go, oh, we're not really looking at Russia now, notice that kind of sort of fading down a little bit.
[39:09.580 --> 39:15.580]  They're still saying it so you don't notice, but they moved on to any crime, any money laundering.
[39:15.580 --> 39:19.580]  Well, they can call money laundering, I've seen cases where somebody bounces a check
[39:19.580 --> 39:25.580]  or on a financial form says they have more money or less money than they actually had
[39:25.580 --> 39:27.580]  when they're buying a house.
[39:28.580 --> 39:31.580]  Now, you're sitting there buying a car, buying a house, shooting a credit check.
[39:31.580 --> 39:32.580]  They go, how much do you make a year?
[39:32.580 --> 39:34.580]  And you go, oh, I make this.
[39:34.580 --> 39:40.580]  Well, the FBI will go find that and say, look, six years ago on a form, buying a car,
[39:40.580 --> 39:43.580]  you lie on a federal document.
[39:45.580 --> 39:47.580]  What are they doing to Benjamin yet in Yahoo?
[39:47.580 --> 39:52.580]  Forget if you love him, hate him, whatever, or pragmatic about that in Yahoo.
[39:52.580 --> 39:55.580]  Like I am.
[39:55.580 --> 40:04.580]  They got his wife indicted or facing indictment for cell phone bills that weren't to government people
[40:04.580 --> 40:07.580]  or cleaning crews at her house.
[40:07.580 --> 40:10.580]  He's the prime minister of Israel.
[40:10.580 --> 40:12.580]  I mean, imagine the next thing.
[40:12.580 --> 40:15.580]  Oh my gosh, Trump.
[40:15.580 --> 40:17.580]  You know, let's look at sea of Ivanka.
[40:17.580 --> 40:25.580]  Has any cleaning crews paid for by the government cleaning her condo at Trump Tower?
[40:25.580 --> 40:28.580]  Member Colonel Schaefer, when he exposed the government wouldn't kill bin Laden.
[40:28.580 --> 40:34.580]  He was backing Al Qaeda and protecting him, heading up the anti-Al Qaeda group in the army.
[40:34.580 --> 40:37.580]  They talked about indicting him.
[40:37.580 --> 40:43.580]  The numbers were like $24 in cell phone bills that weren't to the Pentagon, but were to his wife.
[40:43.580 --> 40:49.580]  And they actually said he may have taken pencils home.
[40:49.580 --> 40:50.580]  That's right.
[40:50.580 --> 41:00.580]  They said, I mean, the guy's so clean, pencils and cell phone bills to his wife.
[41:00.580 --> 41:02.580]  That's what they got.
[41:02.580 --> 41:04.580]  And they dropped it because it was so dumb.
[41:04.580 --> 41:07.580]  They were set to indict him, though.
[41:07.580 --> 41:13.580]  We had to look that up, look up Colonel Schaefer under criminal investigation.
[41:13.580 --> 41:15.580]  It was like 2003.
[41:15.580 --> 41:16.580]  They were having hearings.
[41:16.580 --> 41:17.580]  He testified secretly.
[41:17.580 --> 41:18.580]  They got real mad.
[41:18.580 --> 41:20.580]  And so they then were to try to indict him.
[41:20.580 --> 41:27.580]  It was in the news like he had cell phone bill or $20 something was to his wife and $40 something was to his mom.
[41:27.580 --> 41:28.580]  It was stuff like that.
[41:28.580 --> 41:30.580]  And I was just reading this in the newspaper.
[41:30.580 --> 41:31.580]  What?
[41:31.580 --> 41:35.580]  Yeah, we've got cell phone bills that might total over $100.
[41:35.580 --> 41:38.580]  And under federal law, that's stealing.
[41:38.580 --> 41:39.580]  We may indict him.
[41:39.580 --> 41:47.580]  You called your mama.
[41:47.580 --> 41:54.580]  So we've got the Clintons giving nuclear weapons, the reactors to create the fissile material.
[41:54.580 --> 42:01.580]  And we've got them giving them the missile secrets and empowering them and sending Jimmy Carter over there and all this stuff.
[42:01.580 --> 42:06.580]  It's okay.
[42:06.580 --> 42:07.580]  There it is.
[42:07.580 --> 42:12.580]  There's the inspector general's case number as they closed in 2006 for his cell phone years.
[42:12.580 --> 42:13.580]  Yes.
[42:13.580 --> 42:14.580]  The Internet's incredible.
[42:14.580 --> 42:16.580]  We just pulled it right up.
[42:16.580 --> 42:20.580]  Hell, why don't they execute Tony Schaefer for that?
[42:20.580 --> 42:22.580]  But this is how they operate.
[42:22.580 --> 42:27.580]  And it's the same thing with Benjamin Netanyahu's wife.
[42:27.580 --> 42:28.580]  Yeah.
[42:28.580 --> 42:30.580]  Yeah.
[42:30.580 --> 42:32.580]  Oh, and dinners too.
[42:32.580 --> 42:35.580]  Dinners paid for by the government where everyone there wasn't from the government.
[42:35.580 --> 42:40.580]  Oh my gosh, the prime minister, the president of Israel had dinners.
[42:40.580 --> 42:43.580]  And some of his friends were there and the taxpayers paid for the dinners.
[42:43.580 --> 42:46.580]  What do you think the dinners at the White House are?
[42:46.580 --> 42:52.580]  When Oprah Winfrey or, you know, Madonna's there.
[42:52.580 --> 43:01.580]  Yeah, there it is, attorney general in Dites, Sarah Netanyahu, and then I was reading the hundreds of things they're listing.
[43:01.580 --> 43:03.580]  It's like a piece of silverware came up missing.
[43:03.580 --> 43:06.580]  Oh my gosh.
[43:06.580 --> 43:12.580]  This is, but meanwhile the Clintons stole all the cutlery and all the plates out of the White House and then had to give them back.
[43:12.580 --> 43:15.580]  Remember that at the George Washington stuff.
[43:15.580 --> 43:23.580]  Share to be indicted for using public funds for personal expenses. Let's just move on. And I'm not even defending Netanyahu.
[43:23.580 --> 43:25.580]  It's not about Netanyahu.
[43:25.580 --> 43:38.580]  It's about the Clintons have billions of dollars stolen and given to them by foreign governments to sell out US interest while she was the secretary of state where you basically walk up to a computer window via email.
[43:38.580 --> 43:43.580]  Tell them what you want. They give you the money and then she changes the policy.
[43:43.580 --> 43:45.580]  Governor Manding Obama.
[43:45.580 --> 43:52.580]  Talk about deep state. Our government's so corrupt that you just got rogue elements running their own thieving operations everywhere.
[43:52.580 --> 43:57.580]  It's pretty much normal now to have all these different factions that are not just ignoring Trump.
[43:57.580 --> 44:01.580]  That's what they do separate from Trump.
[44:01.580 --> 44:07.580]  And a president just kind of feeds a pack of wild dogs and tries to keep them at bay and tries to kiss all their butts.
[44:07.580 --> 44:10.580]  That's what normally goes on with the Barack Obama.
[44:10.580 --> 44:19.580]  With the Hillary Clinton. It's totally different. She's in there organizing all the fraud and making sure it flows through her separate while Obama played golf and did photo ops.
[44:19.580 --> 44:31.580]  She was the president. That's admitted running the state department that basically controls all the other agencies putting in all her people and then just swindling everything but also trying to shut down our economy as much as she could.
[44:31.580 --> 44:39.580]  Because you know she's got that bull like instinct to keep her slave that she's pimping down.
[44:39.580 --> 44:45.580]  You don't let one aunt stand up because if one's aunt stands up they might all stand up.
[44:45.580 --> 44:52.580]  And then those puny aunts outnumber us a hundred to one.
[44:52.580 --> 44:59.580]  So this is the level we're reaching. So let me give you the big takeaway from my perspective here.
[44:59.580 --> 45:01.580]  We're facing China and Russia.
[45:01.580 --> 45:09.580]  Trump had tried to cut Russia out of the deal and get them to back us. Russia was ready to do it but the globalists have put the kibosh on that one.
[45:09.580 --> 45:15.580]  China is kind of ambivalent. North Korea is out of control more and more. Not even doing what they say there are real sanctions.
[45:15.580 --> 45:17.580]  This is really coming to a head but it's out of control.
[45:17.580 --> 45:22.580]  McMaster wants to be in charge of political diversion from his problems. He's pushing for preemptive strikes.
[45:22.580 --> 45:31.580]  That then gives Kim Jong-un the excuse to act like that and the whole thing is just out of control.
[45:31.580 --> 45:38.580]  But then you get the political piggybacking when Trump had nothing to do with this and Merkel saying settle down Trump.
[45:38.580 --> 45:49.580]  No you settle down you communist appeaser both your parents dirty communist collaborators at the fall of Germany putting in the Russian control in East Germany.
[45:49.580 --> 45:53.580]  Just as bad as the Nazis in many respects.
[45:53.580 --> 46:01.580]  Like a weird Nazi communist abalgamation made a real nasty combination there didn't it. Real stinky thing.
[46:01.580 --> 46:08.580]  But here we go FBI conducted pre-dawn raid of former Trump campaign chairman and Roger Stones joining us exclusively.
[46:08.580 --> 46:14.580]  Former business partners with him. Pretty much you know really good buddies.
[46:14.580 --> 46:20.580]  You're going to get the real scoop on this exclusively.
[46:20.580 --> 46:26.580]  But quite frankly what does this signify what's the takeaway here.
[46:26.580 --> 46:30.580]  That the coup against Trump is going from a trot.
[46:30.580 --> 46:33.580]  To a gallop. To an all out.
[46:33.580 --> 46:36.580]  Pedal to the metal.
[46:36.580 --> 46:38.580]  Bloody your spurs.
[46:38.580 --> 46:40.580]  Yeah mule.
[46:40.580 --> 46:42.580]  Over the edge of the cliff craziness.
[46:42.580 --> 46:53.580]  With a totally political totally corrupt completely partisan total conflict of interest like nothing I've ever seen.
[46:53.580 --> 47:07.580]  It'd be like if you were divorcing your wife or husband and they were the divorce court judges I've said over their own case it's it's it's textbook crazy.
[47:07.580 --> 47:16.580]  Just like a Google executive employee manager puts out a very well penned deal saying look we're not advancing people according to how good they are.
[47:16.580 --> 47:21.580]  We're doing it political correctness and it's messing things up.
[47:21.580 --> 47:32.580]  And I'll take anybody from any pool we can get there's a larger pool of male engineers and you know we need these people and say he's he's fired.
[47:32.580 --> 47:37.580]  You see first they say oh just banned Nazis pretty soon it's banned everybody.
[47:37.580 --> 47:49.580]  We just got banned off a big web sharing service deal where I wanted to be able to share ads for our local radio stations on our platforms and basically pay for them but also have them become self generating with the.
[47:49.580 --> 47:52.580]  And actually have a way to have affiliate agreements to help our stations.
[47:52.580 --> 48:02.580]  And they told us oh you're you you have the potential to be bigoted so you're not allowed and it's a total lawsuit but do I have the time to do it at a certain point.
[48:02.580 --> 48:05.580]  I keep saying I'm going to have to follow some lawsuits.
[48:05.580 --> 48:08.580]  We're writing a story about it right now.
[48:08.580 --> 48:17.580]  I mean I have to threaten Google publicly and privately lawsuits they have to get letters from me now just to back off and not ban us.
[48:17.580 --> 48:24.580]  You know we'll just go another platform they're going to go to everybody's platform next we got to hold them and fight them on their territory ever heard that before.
[48:24.580 --> 48:27.580]  Got to find them over there is it over here we got to fight them at Google.
[48:27.580 --> 48:29.580]  Find them at YouTube their creature.
[48:29.580 --> 48:30.580]  Find them on Facebook.
[48:30.580 --> 48:31.580]  Fight them on Twitter.
[48:31.580 --> 48:32.580]  Fight them on dig.
[48:32.580 --> 48:33.580]  Fight them on Reddit.
[48:33.580 --> 48:34.580]  Fight them.
[48:34.580 --> 48:35.580]  Fight them.
[48:35.580 --> 48:36.580]  Fight them.
[48:36.580 --> 48:37.580]  Fight them.
[48:37.580 --> 48:38.580]  Fight them.
[48:38.580 --> 48:45.580]  Yes we're dug in here with our own systems and trying to build them and expand them and trying to get out everywhere we can but for every tentacle I grow they cut one off.
[48:45.580 --> 48:50.580]  I'm trying to shoot out as many spores as I can as many heads are hacking my heads off.
[48:50.580 --> 48:51.580]  I'm growing them faster and faster.
[48:51.580 --> 48:53.580]  Hack one off two more pop out.
[48:53.580 --> 48:54.580]  Hack those off six more.
[48:54.580 --> 48:55.580]  They hack those.
[48:55.580 --> 48:59.580]  I mean and I'm not complaining but I mean we're in a fight here.
[48:59.580 --> 49:01.580]  I got like two battle axes fighting them.
[49:01.580 --> 49:02.580]  They're hacking at me.
[49:02.580 --> 49:04.580]  We're like when we're not even thinking about his winning.
[49:04.580 --> 49:05.580]  That's when you know you're in a fight.
[49:05.580 --> 49:06.580]  You ain't thinking about winning.
[49:06.580 --> 49:13.580]  You're thinking about surviving.
[49:13.580 --> 49:15.580]  That's where we are.
[49:15.580 --> 49:16.580]  Okay.
[49:16.580 --> 49:21.580]  So nuclear war top British newspapers say find out you know your nuclear fallout shelter.
[49:21.580 --> 49:24.580]  That's on info wars.com.
[49:24.580 --> 49:28.580]  They're accelerating their incredible witch hunt because there is no rush of stuff.
[49:28.580 --> 49:42.580]  So they now just want to have an criminal investigation show that it just looks bad and then you know have this grand jury indict Trump when they're 90 plus percent Democrat voters in the district of criminals.
[49:42.580 --> 49:45.580]  And just oh look indictments.
[49:45.580 --> 49:46.580]  Oh FBI raids.
[49:46.580 --> 49:50.580]  But we never saw those FBI raids.
[49:50.580 --> 49:54.580]  We never saw those indictments.
[49:54.580 --> 50:10.580]  We never saw anything with Clintons and Lynch and the corruption and the Chinese generals inside the White House and the missile secrets and the cattle futures and the dead bodies and the foundation and the Haiti looting and the emails and the illegal server.
[50:10.580 --> 50:19.580]  And the communications from all these foreign governments corporations saying we'll have the three million in next week and then can we meet with her the next day.
[50:19.580 --> 50:27.580]  She's coming to Morocco will have 12 million wired before she gets here and we need her to then bring in sanctions to shut down US phosphate.
[50:27.580 --> 50:28.580]  I mean it's all there.
[50:28.580 --> 50:30.580]  She shuts down hundreds of millions of phosphate.
[50:30.580 --> 50:32.580]  She gets 12 million.
[50:32.580 --> 50:40.580]  Just cut and dry baby like robbers coming out of the bank with bags of cash in their hands.
[50:40.580 --> 50:43.580]  And the nightly news is there catching them with the police.
[50:43.580 --> 50:46.580]  He's just got bags of money in her hands just right there.
[50:46.580 --> 50:49.580]  Meanwhile the FBI and the Russians.
[50:49.580 --> 50:56.580]  They've raided a predawn Swatty raid manifold the dangerous criminal with no criminal record.

[54:31.580 --> 54:51.580]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[54:51.580 --> 54:53.580]  Great part right here.
[54:53.580 --> 55:04.580]  The Blitzkrieg.
[55:04.580 --> 55:06.580]  Again, I am your host, Alex Jones.
[55:06.580 --> 55:08.580]  Let's get serious here.
[55:08.580 --> 55:14.580]  I'm obviously very excited, not in a good way, but I can't help the amount of energy I've got today
[55:14.580 --> 55:17.580]  because we are on the edge of nuclear war with China and Russia.
[55:17.580 --> 55:20.580]  The preparations of this have been decades in the making.
[55:20.580 --> 55:24.580]  The main trigger, according to all the experts I respect in my own research, is North Korea.
[55:24.580 --> 55:26.580]  Kim Jong-un is out of his mind.
[55:26.580 --> 55:29.580]  He's got tens of millions of poor, pathetic slaves under him.
[55:29.580 --> 55:31.580]  Remember that they are a brainwashed cult.
[55:31.580 --> 55:33.580]  They're not our enemy.
[55:33.580 --> 55:40.580]  Only maybe one half of 1% the leadership and then maybe 5% under them that are the psychotic controllers
[55:40.580 --> 55:50.580]  and who enjoy the country's main gross domestic product, enslavement, evil, torture, and innocence crying out for God.
[55:50.580 --> 55:54.580]  Remember, it's anti-Christ. It's anti-Christian.
[55:54.580 --> 55:56.580]  Remember that, and the globalists have cheated.
[55:56.580 --> 56:04.580]  They say, oh, be open to other religions and communism, and then it comes in and it bans Islam, communism, bans everything but itself.
[56:04.580 --> 56:07.580]  Just like the sanctuary cities, 800 plus.
[56:07.580 --> 56:10.580]  Nobody else says we have sanctuary cities but areas of Europe.
[56:10.580 --> 56:16.580]  With the globalists bringing people in to politicize, race, and then use them as racial voting blocks.
[56:16.580 --> 56:18.580]  That's cheating.
[56:18.580 --> 56:27.580]  The Western world, Christians, pass all these laws, open up the borders, bring in all these people, use their labor, their culture, their smarts, a lot of positive things,
[56:27.580 --> 56:35.580]  but then try to turn America's strength of real diversity against it and create classical racism against white people,
[56:35.580 --> 56:41.580]  which you're then forced to respond to, which becomes classical race battle.
[56:41.580 --> 56:43.580]  But it is what it is.
[56:43.580 --> 56:46.580]  It's been manifest. It's been done. It's been foisted.
[56:46.580 --> 56:50.580]  But you've got to understand the North Korea threats real, but it was created.
[56:50.580 --> 57:01.580]  You've got to understand all this race-baiting coming down against you, if you're Hispanic or white or whatever it is, is real in the person's mind doing it, but is a mirage.
[57:01.580 --> 57:12.580]  It's still nevertheless real. If you're a white guy, because it happens 12 to 1, 15 to 1, most of the cases turn out to be false flags when it is whites reportedly attacking black people.
[57:12.580 --> 57:13.580]  It's just a fact.
[57:13.580 --> 57:24.580]  Black folks, a certain percentage of them, a small minority percentage, but still it's a high number when they attack are just tracking down whites and shooting them, killing them, beating them, attacking them.
[57:24.580 --> 57:28.580]  If they have blonde hair and blue eyes, they just attack them and say, you voted for Trump.
[57:28.580 --> 57:32.580]  The videos are legion.
[57:32.580 --> 57:37.580]  That's mind control. That's CNN and the globalist desperate rearguard action.
[57:37.580 --> 57:44.580]  It's in the WikiLeaks using cultural warfare to distract from what they're doing, screwing us all over.
[57:44.580 --> 57:46.580]  The litmus test.
[57:46.580 --> 57:50.580]  You see any Hispanic groups telling people, don't take the Gardasil shot?
[57:50.580 --> 57:53.580]  No.
[57:53.580 --> 58:01.580]  See, if I didn't like Hispanics, I'd be saying take your shots because it's known to massively reduce fertility.
[58:01.580 --> 58:07.580]  And then some people go, well, if the whole world's going to be Hispanic here in the United States and I turn them into racist good, kill them.
[58:07.580 --> 58:10.580]  They're killing everybody, idiots.
[58:10.580 --> 58:14.580]  They're coming after everybody. We have to realize it.
[58:14.580 --> 58:21.580]  It doesn't mean we don't expose the hypocrisy and all the garbage, but it doesn't mean we're under its control.
[58:21.580 --> 58:23.580]  Briefly.
[58:23.580 --> 58:26.580]  Skip breaks. Don't even plug like other hosts every minute. Just support us.
[58:26.580 --> 58:29.580]  We need financial support. We've got great fluoride-free toothpaste.
[58:29.580 --> 58:31.580]  The kid's version is back in bubblegum flavor.
[58:31.580 --> 58:34.580]  We've got great water filtration, great air purifiers, 25% off.
[58:34.580 --> 58:38.580]  1776 from Rainforest, 1776 for the X2.
[58:38.580 --> 58:40.580]  We've never had 55% off on those.
[58:40.580 --> 58:43.580]  And those specials are going to have to ensue as we're getting low on those.
[58:43.580 --> 58:46.580]  Infowarsstore.com, please support us.
[58:46.580 --> 58:52.580]  But whatever you do, pray for us. Pray for America. Pray for peace. Pray for North Korea.
[58:52.580 --> 59:21.580]  And financial support to Transmission.
[59:23.580 --> 59:27.580]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[59:27.580 --> 59:33.580]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[59:33.580 --> 59:35.580]  You owe it to yourself. You owe it to your family.
[59:35.580 --> 59:42.580]  And you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.
[59:42.580 --> 59:50.580]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[59:50.580 --> 59:53.580]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[59:53.580 --> 59:57.580]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Field and infowarslive.com.
[59:59.580 --> 01:00:02.580]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:02.580 --> 01:00:07.580]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:37.580]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:44.580]  Look at these headlines up on drugreport.com.
[01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:48.580]  Wall Street Journal calls out Bannon for White House dysfunction.
[01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:52.580]  Poisonous atmosphere.
[01:00:52.580 --> 01:01:01.580]  Yes, everybody gangs up on Bannon because they know he helped write the blueprint for the American reboot.
[01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:11.580]  And even the Wall Street Journal Fox News, more and more, it's getting anti-Trump going after his allies.
[01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:14.580]  Manafort rated bank records.
[01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:20.580]  We're going to be getting to that with Roger Stone, his former business partner on the other side.
[01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:23.580]  And he's been subpoenaed for the same non-existent Russia records.
[01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:30.580]  So when you don't send in the non-existent records, it's like give us your documents when you were in communication with the Easter Bunny.
[01:01:30.580 --> 01:01:33.580]  I'm like, I am not in communication with the Easter Bunny.
[01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:38.580]  We're going to have to get a warrant for that then because we've happened to believe you've been talking to a little furry friend.
[01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:41.580]  It's got a cotton tail.
[01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:45.580]  Trump, nuke boast, bombers ready, North Korea, no joke.
[01:01:45.580 --> 01:01:48.580]  Guam in the crosshairs, world of worry.
[01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:51.580]  Mattis, world.
[01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:56.580]  Bees to understand this could lead to end of regime.
[01:01:56.580 --> 01:02:07.580]  Oh, yeah, understand this, you can't just shoot or cruise missile or particle beam one of their missiles on the tarmac.
[01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:11.580]  On the launch pad, on the gantry.
[01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:15.580]  Because North Korea is then going to attack South Korea and Japan.
[01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:22.580]  Everybody else are completely whacked out of their minds with a crazy obese penguin running them.
[01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:25.580]  The demonic hedgehog.
[01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:29.580]  If we do have a nuclear war and an inhuman life on earth, the hedgehog killed us.
[01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:32.580]  It's what Hitler looks like too, a little potbellied guy up there.
[01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:36.580]  At least Hitler actually had the congressional medal of honor from the Germans.
[01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:38.580]  He had the iron cross first class.
[01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:43.580]  Kim Jong-un was in a Swiss boarding school until he was 18 years old.
[01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:53.580]  His brother got caught by his other brother trying to sneak into Disney World in Japan so he had him with nerve gas.
[01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:56.580]  Can't make this up.
[01:02:56.580 --> 01:02:59.580]  So we'll play that clip again here right now.
[01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:07.580]  This is Trump talking about fire and fury.
[01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:10.580]  Fire and fury and power.
[01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:20.580]  Which, yes, is what will happen because if he does fire some preemptive strike, which North Korea is saying it's going to do or may do against Guam,
[01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:24.580]  or against Japan, or against South Korea, or against the U.S. mainland,
[01:03:24.580 --> 01:03:33.580]  you have to then take out his forces on the DMZ and only atomic, nuclear, hydrogen weapons, particle weapons are going to do that.
[01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:36.580]  And you've got to get them all.
[01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:42.580]  Let's play a clip from the president and talk about the stuff that Armageddon's made of.
[01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:44.580]  This is really happening. Here it is.
[01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:50.580]  North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States.
[01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:58.580]  They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.
[01:03:58.580 --> 01:04:04.580]  He has been very threatening beyond a normal state.
[01:04:04.580 --> 01:04:15.580]  And as I said, they will be met with fire, fury, and frankly power, the likes of which this world has never seen before.
[01:04:15.580 --> 01:04:19.580]  Well, Trump looks pretty...
[01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:22.580]  I'll say it, pretty evil right there. Looks pretty scary, doesn't he?
[01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:24.580]  That's the real Donald Trump right there.
[01:04:24.580 --> 01:04:28.580]  Now, I'm not saying evil in a bad way. He looks scary.
[01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:30.580]  You're talking about nuclear war. That is evil.
[01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:35.580]  But if somebody is going to do it to you, you've got to do it to them, which I'm not cheerleading or pushing for.
[01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:39.580]  I have four children. And believe me, my guts are just...
[01:04:39.580 --> 01:04:44.580]  I don't have irrational fears generally. I don't have just all anxiety because they said so.
[01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:49.580]  I think all of us know there is like a nasty, dirty feeling.
[01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:56.580]  Just remember the little Easter Bunny that did exist called Bill Clinton and Hillary that laid the little eggies over there in North Korea.
[01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:59.580]  The missiles and the nooks. I was looking at a map, you know?
[01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:04.580]  We've dropped atomic bombs real close to North Korea before. We have only we.
[01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:36.580]  To alter or to abolish it and to institute new government.
[01:05:36.580 --> 01:05:39.580]  Independence isn't a day. It's a mindset.
[01:05:39.580 --> 01:05:43.580]  An attitude that says, I will not be your dependent. I will not be your slave.
[01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:49.580]  Dependence and slavery is a chain that is forged link by link with gradual infringements.
[01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:54.580]  When you trade your liberty for safety, to that extent, you become their slave.
[01:05:54.580 --> 01:05:58.580]  Slaves are never safe. You won't get rich by being a slave.
[01:05:58.580 --> 01:05:59.580]  Guard your liberty.
[01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:02.580]  Regard with suspicion anyone who tries to take it.
[01:06:02.580 --> 01:06:31.580]  Remember Wars.com. I'm David Dyke.
[01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:47.580]  I'm David Dyke.
[01:06:47.580 --> 01:06:52.580]  I'm David Dyke.
[01:06:52.580 --> 01:07:07.580]  I'm David Dyke.

[01:08:35.580 --> 01:08:39.140]  ants in line.
[01:08:42.900 --> 01:08:50.700]  The Alex Jones Show because there is a war on for your mind.
[01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:59.500]  This is really happening this is President Trump last night responding
[01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:03.820]  after Kim Jong-un, the hereditary dictator of North Korea, given nuclear
[01:09:03.820 --> 01:09:08.900]  weapons by the Clintons, threatened to preemptively nuke the United States again.
[01:09:08.900 --> 01:09:16.460]  Here it is. Korea best not make any more threats to the United States. They will
[01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:25.260]  be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen. He has been very
[01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:33.340]  threatening beyond a normal state and as I said they will be met with fire, fury
[01:09:33.340 --> 01:09:41.820]  and frankly power the likes of which this world has never seen before. Corporate
[01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:46.420]  fake press has Merkel running around and others trying to act like Trump is
[01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:51.460]  escalating things and that Trump is bad. Trump didn't give the fissile material,
[01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:55.740]  the reactors North Korea, the Clintons did with a bipartisan group out of the
[01:09:55.740 --> 01:10:02.660]  U.S. Trump didn't give them the missile secrets, the globalists did. Trump didn't
[01:10:02.660 --> 01:10:09.420]  give the Russians atomic weapons in the late 40s. Leftist in our government did.
[01:10:09.420 --> 01:10:14.900]  The scourge of the planet. Leftist collectivist and now we have seen the
[01:10:14.900 --> 01:10:22.820]  armistice the ceasefire since 1953 July 27th and here we are looking at Kim
[01:10:22.820 --> 01:10:26.820]  Jong-un threatening to strike Guam with medium-range missiles with nuclear
[01:10:26.820 --> 01:10:29.900]  weapons threatening to attack the U.S. and now he's got missiles and warheads
[01:10:29.900 --> 01:10:34.940]  that can hit us according to Pentagon reports. The question is would they
[01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:44.140]  re-enter properly? Would they deploy? This is a big deal. Now it's multifaceted.
[01:10:44.140 --> 01:10:48.220]  You've got McMaster that's kind of been pushing for print strikes and saying
[01:10:48.220 --> 01:10:52.820]  that which then gives North Korea the excuse to escalate. McMaster wants that
[01:10:52.820 --> 01:10:58.420]  as a political distraction from the things he's doing and you've also got a
[01:10:58.420 --> 01:11:04.420]  lot of deep state actors that are in communication with North Korea that are
[01:11:04.420 --> 01:11:10.700]  empowering Kim Jong-un to believe that he can intimidate Trump and embarrass him
[01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:16.820]  and he's being goaded from my sources into this. Now it may be a quadruple
[01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:22.900]  double-cross game but we know the Jimmy Carter's, the Bill Clinton's, the Hillary
[01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:26.140]  Clinton's, the globalists of the world are in constant communication with his top
[01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:33.100]  generals and with the North Korean dictator. More so maybe even than China.
[01:11:33.380 --> 01:11:38.140]  North Korea was left there as a strategic detonator used by all sides as
[01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:42.340]  the crisis between India and China escalates and as they openly threaten
[01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:47.900]  war with each other. But at infowars.com is the headline. Two of Britain's
[01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:52.580]  biggest newspapers sell the public to prepare for nuclear war and to find their
[01:11:52.580 --> 01:11:57.180]  local fallout shelter. I'm not saying I think this is going to happen. I have
[01:11:57.180 --> 01:12:01.580]  four children. I don't want war with North Korea but if he preemptively fires
[01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:07.460]  weapons and attacks somebody he has to be decapitated quickly and Russia and
[01:12:07.460 --> 01:12:12.900]  China have to be told in no uncertain terms do not get involved in this when
[01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:16.500]  we do this and they've been signaling they're going to stand down but don't
[01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:20.260]  want it to happen. I don't want it to happen either but if we go to war it's
[01:12:20.260 --> 01:12:24.340]  got to be regime change and it's got to be devastating and it ladies and
[01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:28.460]  gentlemen we can't conventionally take on North Korea. They've got a million plus
[01:12:28.460 --> 01:12:35.180]  man brainwashed army. I'd say it's 20 times worse than Iraq. Cult-like following
[01:12:35.180 --> 01:12:39.260]  they will attack a hundred thousand pieces of artillery. Kutusha rockets the
[01:12:39.260 --> 01:12:42.900]  whole nine yards you're going to have to hit them with nuclear weapons and I've
[01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:46.180]  talked to all the I've talked to a bunch of experts they agree they have to hit
[01:12:46.180 --> 01:12:50.620]  the entire DMZ with not just conventional but high-powered atomic
[01:12:50.620 --> 01:12:55.940]  weapons hydrogen bombs you name it they can roll out the radiation weapons
[01:12:55.940 --> 01:12:59.260]  directed energy weapons they've got high-powered ones that will kill whole
[01:12:59.260 --> 01:13:04.020]  cities and I'm sad for the slaves in North Korea but if that's what's going to
[01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:08.060]  happen we've already we're still at war with North Korea so coming up at the
[01:13:08.060 --> 01:13:11.940]  bottom of the hour I'm going to walk through all of this the latest now's the
[01:13:11.940 --> 01:13:16.900]  time to be praying now's the time to be praying because deep state is
[01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:19.420]  manipulating the Steve Pachennik's been to North Korea many times he's been
[01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:23.500]  involved as one of the undersecretaries of state in Asia with the State
[01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:27.460]  Department of CIA obviously and he's going to come on he's knows some of the
[01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:32.820]  top generals over there he was just in North Korea a few years ago and we'll
[01:13:32.820 --> 01:13:38.660]  see what he has to say we're going to get Joel Scowles in a World Affairs brief
[01:13:38.660 --> 01:13:48.820]  on we're going to talk about it all but joining us now from DC is Roger Stone we
[01:13:48.820 --> 01:13:53.220]  have seen his former business partner Manafort who was the head of the Trump
[01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:59.580]  campaign rated Roger was the former first campaign head of the 2016 Trump
[01:13:59.580 --> 01:14:04.900]  election campaign FBI conducted pre-dawn rate of former Trump campaign
[01:14:04.900 --> 01:14:09.540]  chairman Manafort's home and what's amazing is the Washington Post admits
[01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:13.660]  he'd already turned over these very documents so this is done in my view
[01:14:13.660 --> 01:14:18.900]  I haven't talked to Roger yet for optics of oh look a grand jury indictment coming
[01:14:18.900 --> 01:14:24.580]  oh see their criminals oh raids it's all done SWAT team raids in the early
[01:14:24.580 --> 01:14:28.460]  morning so you must have it's come with a raid Amish for giving their neighbors
[01:14:28.460 --> 01:14:32.420]  cheese they have a SWAT team and shove the old Amish man down on the ground when
[01:14:32.420 --> 01:14:36.300]  he didn't have a criminal record his daddy's daddy didn't have one nobody's
[01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:39.500]  got a criminal record but we're just going to shove you down in the mud on
[01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:43.180]  camera for the jury because the jury thinks well the FBI the authority
[01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:47.340]  figure shoved the Amish man down for giving his neighbor cheese that was an
[01:14:47.340 --> 01:14:49.980]  FBI informant that's a real case
[01:14:49.980 --> 01:14:54.180]  bond Manafort has voluntarily produced documents the congressional committees
[01:14:54.180 --> 01:14:57.460]  investigating Russia interference the 2016 presidential election the search
[01:14:57.460 --> 01:15:03.300]  warrant indicates investigators may have argued to a federal judge that they had
[01:15:03.300 --> 01:15:06.380]  reasonably Manafort could not be trusted to turn over all the records in
[01:15:06.380 --> 01:15:10.940]  response to a grand jury subpoena but what if what if there are no documents
[01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:14.660]  and that's why they had to do the raid for optics and they admit they've run
[01:15:14.660 --> 01:15:19.020]  into a brick wall now they're saying it's criminal was there any checks or did
[01:15:19.020 --> 01:15:23.620]  he lie on IRS forms it's now a giant drag net run out of the District of
[01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:31.540]  Columbia the swap as given birth to a grand jury with subpoenas going up I'm
[01:15:31.540 --> 01:15:35.780]  told that I may be subpoenaed I know the Federal Elections Commission wants me
[01:15:35.780 --> 01:15:42.820]  subpoenaed for my Russian funding they're saying you buying our products are
[01:15:42.820 --> 01:15:47.380]  Russians they think you're morons they're coming out of the press they're
[01:15:47.380 --> 01:15:51.340]  bullies and I'm proud to stand in the second American Revolution against
[01:15:51.340 --> 01:15:54.460]  globalists that are a thousand times worse than King George the third and
[01:15:54.460 --> 01:15:58.700]  we're winning this is because they're failing the stock market stuff our
[01:15:58.700 --> 01:16:01.780]  military is being rebuilt our veterans are starting to get taken care of they
[01:16:01.780 --> 01:16:05.300]  are borders are getting secured Christianity is being defended again
[01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:11.420]  they don't know what to do in full wars contributor Roger Stone launching his
[01:16:11.420 --> 01:16:15.420]  own syndicated program coming up in early September the war room with Roger
[01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:21.660]  Stone Mike Cernovich and our own Owen shroyer you've heard my breakdown is it
[01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:25.460]  accurate and give us your latest intel have you talked to man afford this was
[01:16:25.460 --> 01:16:28.620]  kept under wraps for a few weeks is it being brought out now to smoke screen
[01:16:28.620 --> 01:16:34.780]  for the fact that we have a Soros known operative down in general McMaster well
[01:16:34.780 --> 01:16:42.540]  Alex your report is essentially correct jack booted dogs authorized by Robert
[01:16:42.540 --> 01:16:48.580]  Mueller picked down the front door of manifold home proceeded to the bedroom
[01:16:48.580 --> 01:16:55.020]  picked down the door to the to the marital bedroom seeking documents that
[01:16:55.020 --> 01:17:01.140]  they had never requested mundane bank statements and documents that would
[01:17:01.140 --> 01:17:07.420]  certainly have been turned over now that mr. Mueller is extremely well acquainted
[01:17:07.420 --> 01:17:13.580]  with the law firm that represents manifold but no request was registered
[01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:20.780]  the reason for this raid is to distract from the fact that prosecutors in the
[01:17:20.780 --> 01:17:25.460]  southern district of New York are now questioning close associates of Hillary
[01:17:25.460 --> 01:17:31.100]  Clinton and are seeking an interview with Hillary and her husband regarding
[01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:37.140]  the activities of the Clinton Foundation evidently Jeff Sessions suddenly woke
[01:17:37.140 --> 01:17:43.140]  up somebody woke him up and therefore I think the Maniforte raid is to made to
[01:17:43.140 --> 01:17:49.140]  distract from the fact that justice may be about to catch up with the Clintons
[01:17:49.140 --> 01:17:55.140]  there is nothing I am told in the records that were seized that is anything
[01:17:55.140 --> 01:18:02.660]  beyond the mundane this is part and parcel of the Mueller effort to frame
[01:18:02.660 --> 01:18:10.300]  Donald Trump or his associates based on constructing a case which the Democrats
[01:18:10.300 --> 01:18:17.740]  should they grab control of the house in 2018 would use as a holy basis for
[01:18:17.740 --> 01:18:26.300]  impeachment that's the game that is a point expanding on that is that breaking
[01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:32.420]  news dealing with sessions beginning to go after Hillary herself it has been
[01:18:32.420 --> 01:18:38.660]  intimated on the net but I have now confirmed from law enforcement sources
[01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:45.020]  in New York that there is definite movement and I will have more to report
[01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:53.300]  at 2 p.m. central time today on info wars I'm still gathering data on this and
[01:18:53.300 --> 01:19:01.820]  the latest on McMaster's coordination with George Soros and the Soros mole
[01:19:01.820 --> 01:19:11.460]  in the Trump White House Fiona L more on all of that later today on info wars
[01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:16.420]  Roger this is like an action-adventure movie we're now living in with North
[01:19:16.420 --> 01:19:21.020]  Korea and the Clintons arming them and now the Clintons still someone in power
[01:19:21.020 --> 01:19:25.380]  through you know this corrupt shadow state battling the American people and
[01:19:25.380 --> 01:19:30.140]  President Trump and the people it seems though we're seeing right through this
[01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:34.660]  they're running all these new hoaxes that he's down in the polls which are our
[01:19:34.660 --> 01:19:38.180]  research shows is it true they're starting to abandon a lot of the Russian
[01:19:38.180 --> 01:19:43.700]  narrative though and are moving as you predicted six months ago to just general
[01:19:43.700 --> 01:19:50.060]  obstruction of anything crimes bounce checks anybody in the government you
[01:19:50.060 --> 01:19:53.380]  know having a government employee shine their shoes I mean just like with net
[01:19:53.380 --> 01:19:58.260]  yahoo's wife for cell phone bills or whatever it's now taking on classic
[01:19:58.260 --> 01:20:05.660]  dragnet complete witch hunt run by people that Trump has fired that are on
[01:20:05.660 --> 01:20:10.740]  Mueller staff well I think you're exactly right Alex the problem
[01:20:10.740 --> 01:20:16.140]  fundamentally is that the Obama's still run the US Justice Department in the
[01:20:16.140 --> 01:20:23.780]  recent trial of Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio a key endorser of Donald
[01:20:23.780 --> 01:20:28.340]  Trump the Justice Department monitored his communications with his attorneys
[01:20:28.340 --> 01:20:34.100]  during the trial they they communicated improperly with the judge during the
[01:20:34.100 --> 01:20:39.460]  trial and all of this of course is payback for Sheriff Joe's support of
[01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:45.340]  Donald Trump and his claims that Barack Obama was not born in the United States
[01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:52.460]  which he has sought to pursue you would think that the Trump Justice Department
[01:20:52.460 --> 01:20:57.660]  would dismiss this case but there is no one who works for Trump working at
[01:20:57.660 --> 01:21:03.900]  justice other than Jeff Sessions who very sadly appears to be asleep I think
[01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:11.460]  he's asleep actually instead of pursuing the Clintons who certainly deserved to
[01:21:11.460 --> 01:21:19.100]  go to jail we have the entire front line of the NSA under Barack Obama wire
[01:21:19.100 --> 01:21:26.060]  tapping and surveilling at least 30,000 people Brennan knew Rogers knew Valerie
[01:21:26.060 --> 01:21:32.300]  Jarrett knew Susan Rice knew Ben Rhodes knew but there's no one kicking in
[01:21:32.300 --> 01:21:36.700]  their doors at five o'clock in the morning and arresting them Barack Obama
[01:21:36.700 --> 01:21:42.980]  is running the US Justice Department under the Trump presidency it's
[01:21:42.980 --> 01:21:47.180]  extraordinary and frankly quite sad and he's moved in down the block in a
[01:21:47.180 --> 01:21:52.700]  lavish armored compound with walls to run the operation before he left office
[01:21:52.700 --> 01:21:56.420]  when president Trump was president-elect Obama bragged in his surrogates bragged
[01:21:56.420 --> 01:22:01.460]  we're digging in we're even putting more people in positions or even finding
[01:22:01.460 --> 01:22:05.740]  people that don't have a social history online that are our operatives and they
[01:22:05.740 --> 01:22:10.860]  even put spies in and as you said even the New York Times now admits that
[01:22:10.860 --> 01:22:17.340]  they're out going to government employees to recruit them as moles somewhere it is
[01:22:17.340 --> 01:22:24.580]  money's being paid this is an espionage operation against our own government and
[01:22:24.580 --> 01:22:30.580]  it just gets more intense more serious as no one is punished and more emboldened
[01:22:30.580 --> 01:22:37.860]  and more brazen I mean I've just never even imagined in a spy novel something
[01:22:37.860 --> 01:22:44.100]  this insane so where is it going now well I think there's every possible
[01:22:44.100 --> 01:22:49.420]  effort being made to silence anyone who would expose what's going on this
[01:22:49.420 --> 01:22:55.620]  lawsuit that Obama and his allies filed against me is a is a an outrageous
[01:22:55.620 --> 01:23:03.180]  abusive process it's a tissue of lies and I would be unconcerned about it
[01:23:03.180 --> 01:23:06.540]  except for it's going to be heard in the District of Columbia where the chances
[01:23:06.540 --> 01:23:12.300]  of my getting a fair judge or a reasonable jury are non-existent it's
[01:23:12.300 --> 01:23:17.260]  harassment you see Alex if they can distract me and time me up fighting this
[01:23:17.260 --> 01:23:22.060]  phony lawsuit that's time and effort I can't spend trying to save the president
[01:23:22.060 --> 01:23:28.020]  from the cabal of globalists who have settled in around him so I really think
[01:23:28.020 --> 01:23:35.180]  that's the goal we are in for some very tough weeks ahead Mueller has no
[01:23:35.180 --> 01:23:40.020]  concern for the law or the facts he is hell bent on taking down the president
[01:23:40.020 --> 01:23:45.700]  and sadly general Kelly general McMaster and perhaps general Mattis are
[01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:54.060]  prepared to sit back and what that happened Roger clearly if they're able
[01:23:54.060 --> 01:23:56.420]  to remove Trump which I don't think they're gonna be able to do if we stay
[01:23:56.420 --> 01:24:00.740]  on air and stay focused they're gonna go after everybody else they're gonna try
[01:24:00.740 --> 01:24:05.340]  to show up the political system because they know they've lost the people
[01:24:05.340 --> 01:24:09.220]  entirely the public knows that they've broken the social contract and I like
[01:24:09.220 --> 01:24:12.260]  the fact that the president's really gotten tough on sessions and they've
[01:24:12.260 --> 01:24:16.220]  reconciled now and that we're seeing some movement from him but I agree with
[01:24:16.220 --> 01:24:20.900]  congressman Schaffitz and others I don't want press conferences I want
[01:24:20.900 --> 01:24:27.060]  indictments I mean you've got Obama and his people on the news when President
[01:24:27.060 --> 01:24:31.300]  Trump was president elect saying we're going to sabotage we're going to block
[01:24:31.300 --> 01:24:35.740]  we're going to stopping we've been spying on him we're giving all the info to
[01:24:35.740 --> 01:24:38.940]  the media and then Trump gets into office and goes that's illegal and they
[01:24:38.940 --> 01:24:42.060]  go we never said that and we've got hundreds of articles and statements where
[01:24:42.060 --> 01:24:46.740]  they said they did it it's open and shut indictments we think of espionage by
[01:24:46.740 --> 01:24:50.620]  some foreign power this is the most common form of espionage is a coup like
[01:24:50.620 --> 01:24:55.340]  we see in Latin America or Asia or Europe here our coups are just more silent
[01:24:55.340 --> 01:25:00.820]  because we don't do that in the West and it's a classic coup by deep state with
[01:25:00.820 --> 01:25:06.780]  with with comedy shows acting as news bullhorns out there cheerleading and
[01:25:06.780 --> 01:25:11.220]  even targeting you and myself for destruction cutting off our sponsors
[01:25:11.220 --> 01:25:15.940]  trying to put us in prison I would expect it you've talked about this I
[01:25:15.940 --> 01:25:19.580]  would expect a SWAT team right I would expect you to get one because that's
[01:25:19.580 --> 01:25:23.380]  what they do we've sat around we went out on my ski boat a few weeks ago and we
[01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:27.100]  had the discussion over a beer we said I wonder when we get the SWAT team right
[01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:32.100]  because we know that then escalates into them killing us because first they
[01:25:32.100 --> 01:25:36.660]  want to demonize you as a criminal and then have somebody kill you car wreck
[01:25:36.660 --> 01:25:40.780]  or you know carjacking whatever it is or you're found dead with a hooker and you
[01:25:40.780 --> 01:25:44.660]  know heroin this is the kind of crap they do assassinate your character ahead
[01:25:44.660 --> 01:25:48.140]  of actually killing you so I just want everybody to know I'm not a loser if they
[01:25:48.140 --> 01:25:52.740]  kill me I'm a winner we change the world and don't take my death as a loss
[01:25:52.740 --> 01:25:57.340]  take it as a martyr move forward we are going to defeat these people we are the
[01:25:57.340 --> 01:26:01.300]  winners we are the free market we are the Americans we are the patriots we are
[01:26:01.300 --> 01:26:06.540]  the underdogs and we are winning Roger Stone you know Alex I I say again the
[01:26:06.540 --> 01:26:13.100]  key to the president's survival is the FISA court declaration at the end of the
[01:26:13.100 --> 01:26:19.500]  Obama administration which indisputably proves that Obama's NSA was
[01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:24.700]  illegally surveilling up to 30,000 Americans which include Roger Stone
[01:26:24.700 --> 01:26:33.260]  Paul Manafort Donald Trump and in my opinion Alex Jones and General McMaster
[01:26:33.260 --> 01:26:39.060]  and General Kelly have worked very hard to keep the very existence of that
[01:26:39.060 --> 01:26:45.420]  report away from the president because were he to order the prosecutions his
[01:26:45.420 --> 01:26:50.420]  tormentors are defeated Obama will have a hard time running the anti-Trump
[01:26:50.420 --> 01:26:56.700]  campaign from a prison cell instead unfortunately Attorney General Sessions
[01:26:56.700 --> 01:27:02.140]  is too busy chasing marijuana smokers and now chasing the Clintons while I
[01:27:02.140 --> 01:27:06.660]  appreciate the sentiment the Clintons are no longer running the Democratic Party
[01:27:06.660 --> 01:27:11.460]  this is an Obama operation the Clintons are a vague embarrassment to the
[01:27:11.460 --> 01:27:15.860]  Democrats yes they should go to jail for their crimes but there's plenty of time
[01:27:15.860 --> 01:27:22.620]  for that right now they have to gut the centerpiece of the opposition which is
[01:27:22.620 --> 01:27:27.780]  Obama McMaster and if the president was really surrounded by hard-line patriots
[01:27:27.780 --> 01:27:31.740]  like George Washington had they would already have moved against these traders
[01:27:31.740 --> 01:27:35.700]  who are openly in sedition against the Republic and the American way of life
[01:27:35.700 --> 01:27:41.660]  they are the opposite of the American way they are the enemy period talking to
[01:27:41.660 --> 01:27:46.220]  patriots in Florida they are planning to march on Mar-a-Lago the first time the
[01:27:46.220 --> 01:27:52.100]  president goes there to demand the firing of McMaster they will line the
[01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:56.580]  motorcade route they will make it very clear to the president that he is being
[01:27:56.580 --> 01:28:03.780]  misled he is being lied to McMaster works for Soros McMaster reports to
[01:28:03.780 --> 01:28:12.140]  Soros McMaster has inserted a Soros goon Fiona Hill and a a fellow traveler
[01:28:12.140 --> 01:28:19.180]  neocon named Allison Nielsen McMaster does not support the Trump agenda but
[01:28:19.180 --> 01:28:25.300]  these things are being kept from the president the president is unaware that
[01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:32.660]  General McMaster gave Susan Rice a pass on her political espionage the
[01:28:32.660 --> 01:28:40.220]  president is unaware that he extended Susan Rice's national security clearance
[01:28:40.220 --> 01:28:47.260]  the president is unaware that Samantha Powers the UN ambassador was unmasking
[01:28:47.260 --> 01:28:53.300]  hundreds of Republicans and engaging in political espionage in violation of the
[01:28:53.300 --> 01:28:59.300]  Constitution and the law General Kelly has successfully kept that information
[01:28:59.300 --> 01:29:06.140]  from the president now it's heartening to watch Sean Hannity who finally figured
[01:29:06.140 --> 01:29:10.740]  out who the deep state is he's clearly been watching you and I on info wars
[01:29:10.740 --> 01:29:16.460]  because he's he's now repeating our stick Sean get your own script your
[01:29:16.460 --> 01:29:20.380]  heart's in the right place but you don't need to keep repeating at night what we
[01:29:20.380 --> 01:29:23.900]  report on Roger we had a private discussion about this and I and I
[01:29:23.900 --> 01:29:28.540]  normally agree with you but he's seeing the same thing Lou Dobbs is saying at
[01:29:28.540 --> 01:29:32.260]  Colonel Schaefer there it's we're just saying the same thing and yes I use terms
[01:29:32.260 --> 01:29:36.380]  like clear and present danger and things they use it I'm glad I'm glad that
[01:29:36.380 --> 01:29:39.260]  they've looked into our research the Washington Post has demonized him saying
[01:29:39.260 --> 01:29:45.340]  you know he's becoming Alex Jones that's that's good I know I know that you and
[01:29:45.340 --> 01:29:48.020]  him out of beef behind the scenes he should have you on you probably they
[01:29:48.020 --> 01:29:51.300]  probably fire me come on come on but we'll be right back with a few more

[01:34:54.460 --> 01:34:58.460]  but he's gonna get it spankin' because he works for them followers now officially
[01:34:58.460 --> 01:35:02.460]  he doesn't have his external mic he's gonna be hosting it from a hotel room which is okay
[01:35:02.460 --> 01:35:06.460]  but you know we're on all these radio stations I've begged him privately so now
[01:35:06.460 --> 01:35:10.460]  not just woodshed about the not worshiping handy properly I'm joking but now this
[01:35:10.460 --> 01:35:15.460]  seriously though Gallows humor Adam Curry is with us 30 minutes to the next hour
[01:35:15.460 --> 01:35:19.460]  then Steve Pachennick and I'm gonna open the phones up for the first 30 minutes to the next hour
[01:35:19.460 --> 01:35:23.460]  to talk about North Korea they're saying this is the closest to midnight we've ever been with nuclear war
[01:35:23.460 --> 01:35:30.460]  I'm really concerned about it Adam you were pretty excited when you walked in here and saw Roger Stone up there
[01:35:30.460 --> 01:35:35.460]  is he not a living a living character he is a legend and he's really big here on the screen in front of me
[01:35:35.460 --> 01:35:40.460]  Roger how you doin'? I'm excellent you know Alex I don't have an external mic but as the Chinese say
[01:35:40.460 --> 01:35:47.460]  one picture worse a thousand words that's the Chinese huh?
[01:35:47.460 --> 01:35:53.460]  no they made that up oh my gosh hey seriously Roger your take on the whole North Korea situation
[01:35:53.460 --> 01:35:59.460]  well we finally have a president who doesn't draw a line in the sand and then sit back helplessly
[01:35:59.460 --> 01:36:05.460]  while our adversaries cross it I think the boy dictator has picked a fight with the wrong guy
[01:36:05.460 --> 01:36:11.460]  maybe he was used to Obama you know rolling over on everything Trump will not roll over
[01:36:11.460 --> 01:36:20.460]  he will do what is necessary to preserve world peace and to stop these maniacs from incinerating the globe
[01:36:20.460 --> 01:36:29.460]  and should the president continue to make serious progress on improving the economy
[01:36:29.460 --> 01:36:36.460]  and demonstrate his commitment to a tougher minded foreign policy he will get reelected
[01:36:36.460 --> 01:36:44.460]  terrific column by former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown last week saying to his fellow Democrats
[01:36:44.460 --> 01:36:50.460]  wake up you idiots he's on his way to reelect you
[01:36:50.460 --> 01:36:55.460]  Roger other tidbits I mean clearly how would you define this massive escalation is just that
[01:36:55.460 --> 01:37:01.460]  with this optics raid for bank documents that Manafort had agreed if they wanted to turn over
[01:37:01.460 --> 01:37:07.460]  and of course the FBI has digital records going back decades under know your customer they're in all the bank records
[01:37:07.460 --> 01:37:12.460]  this is just ridiculous purely optics and I don't see the American people buying into it
[01:37:12.460 --> 01:37:20.460]  what do you think Alex it's harassment just like the lawsuit I referred to earlier that they filed against me
[01:37:20.460 --> 01:37:30.460]  this is all meant to be harassment no one has yet proven a scintilla of evidence that Manafort colluded in any way with the Russians
[01:37:30.460 --> 01:37:37.460]  or that anyone else in the Trump campaign did but they need to distract from the fact that they were involved
[01:37:37.460 --> 01:37:43.460]  in wholesale political espionage and violation of the Constitution and law
[01:37:43.460 --> 01:37:52.460]  they need to distract from their ongoing crimes the outrageousness of the prosecution of Joe Arpaio
[01:37:52.460 --> 01:38:00.460]  the ongoing secret grand jury seeking an indictment against Julian Assange the journalist who runs Wikileaks
[01:38:00.460 --> 01:38:07.460]  and by the way I mean you mentioned this earlier but what's the work of other sources when they said it publicly they're floating my name around too
[01:38:07.460 --> 01:38:11.460]  in the magic indictment hopper I mean are they going to indict me as being a Roski
[01:38:11.460 --> 01:38:18.460]  we had a meeting last night of the 45 group which is a secret group of Trump loyalists
[01:38:18.460 --> 01:38:24.460]  we have pledged to do what is ever is necessary to avert this coup
[01:38:24.460 --> 01:38:33.460]  and there is some discussion that you are on a hit list for government raid for harassment
[01:38:33.460 --> 01:38:40.460]  I'm on the list there are several others that are mutual friends of ours so you're in good company
[01:38:40.460 --> 01:38:47.460]  but yes I think that Alex you've been targeted because you're the tip of the spear
[01:38:47.460 --> 01:38:55.460]  because you are riling people to stand up against the machine and they would love to silence you
[01:38:55.460 --> 01:39:01.460]  one way as you know that they're seeking to do this is through their manipulation of the internet
[01:39:01.460 --> 01:39:09.460]  the manipulation of the algorithms they've gone from denying that I want to talk about with Adam Curry to just exploding
[01:39:09.460 --> 01:39:16.460]  because it's just really intensifying right now and it shows they know they have nothing left but to try to shut us up
[01:39:16.460 --> 01:39:22.460]  you had the right idea when did you start calling things info wars 20 years ago 25 years ago
[01:39:22.460 --> 01:39:23.460]  about 20 years ago
[01:39:23.460 --> 01:39:29.460]  you had the right idea that is exactly what we're in right now information wars and not so much mainstream media
[01:39:29.460 --> 01:39:36.460]  but the algorithms the algorithms that place things that grab your attention that focus you on certain
[01:39:36.460 --> 01:39:38.460]  we're fighting AI
[01:39:38.460 --> 01:39:43.460]  well I will not give it the moniker of artificial intelligence it's not artificial intelligence
[01:39:43.460 --> 01:39:48.460]  it's more like skip logic you know if if someone likes this and you're going to bring that into them and show this over here
[01:39:48.460 --> 01:39:54.460]  and they've pools they've pooled and I agree with you but they the AI in it is that humans are interfacing with it
[01:39:54.460 --> 01:40:01.460]  and then they're able to program us with the information and we are sent in so really it's an interface
[01:40:01.460 --> 01:40:08.460]  yeah I think AI is just tossed around really easy sure I mean there's no artificial intelligence these are real people as a real movement behind
[01:40:08.460 --> 01:40:16.460]  structuring information it's more of an art form it's totally an art form you're right yeah yeah yeah and there's you know a lot of people doing it
[01:40:16.460 --> 01:40:21.460]  amazing stone thank you so much you're going to be on about an hour and a half
[01:40:21.460 --> 01:40:28.460]  I really appreciate you being a stalwart not backing down the face of all the bullying it is getting intense
[01:40:28.460 --> 01:40:38.460]  Alex always great to be with you and we will have some more exclusive breaking news here at info wars at 2 p.m. Central 3 p.m. Eastern
[01:40:38.460 --> 01:40:46.460]  absolutely folks as a joke Jersey get this hotel have a courier I don't care what I say we must be able to get someone with a mic over
[01:40:46.460 --> 01:40:54.460]  let's have a courier or go over there and bring him a mic it doesn't sound bad but he's going to be on over a hundred radio stations with an internal mic on a laptop
[01:40:54.460 --> 01:41:00.460]  and the reason I'm flipping out about this on air now is all these hosts people trying to get lined up they just won't stop doing it
[01:41:00.460 --> 01:41:06.460]  I mailed them mics I mailed them iPads I mailed them computers to the point we're going to go bankrupt here and it's I love Roger to death
[01:41:06.460 --> 01:41:13.460]  this is why I never have guests on my show you can't count on them to do it right and that's why you're here and you were just here like a year ago
[01:41:13.460 --> 01:41:19.460]  and I said where's Adam Curry he's so awesome because I was watching old videos on MTV but that's not really your true claim to fame
[01:41:19.460 --> 01:41:27.460]  you were known as the pod father inventing the podcast curry.com and the last time you were here I didn't even mention that I'd be like having George Washington here
[01:41:27.460 --> 01:41:34.460]  and not not mentioning you know he didn't shop down the chair he didn't lie about chopping down the cherry tree and didn't go across the Delaware but curry.com
[01:41:34.460 --> 01:41:44.460]  you have of course the no agenda radio no agenda TV show it's good to have you here it's good to be here Alex for sure it was few weeks ago I wanted to get you in here just about culture and internet censorship and everything
[01:41:44.460 --> 01:41:54.460]  but now you're here in the midst of no crazy chipmunk North Korea the president talking about fiery death and doom well a little background my uncle is Donald Greg
[01:41:54.460 --> 01:42:04.460]  and I don't know if you remember who he is but he was the ambassador to South Korea for several years yes he was George H. Walker Bush's
[01:42:04.460 --> 01:42:15.460]  national security advisor long time CIA guy from the OSS days and he's now in his mid eighties and known as Uncle Don to me and when the whole when Rodman was going over there
[01:42:15.460 --> 01:42:23.460]  I had a chance to sit down with my uncle and talk to him and say what is going on and he gave me two hours of I'm sure he didn't tell me everything because he could never do that
[01:42:23.460 --> 01:42:33.460]  you never leave the CIA but he the first thing he said was Dennis Rodman knows more about North Korea than anyone in government and that's coming from a guy who has been to North Korea five times in the last six years
[01:42:33.460 --> 01:42:45.460]  just how insane and quirky and weird it is well not really see first as you correctly said earlier we have an armistice with North Korea the war never ended just a truce we're not going to shoot anything anybody
[01:42:45.460 --> 01:42:59.460]  all they want is to be seen as a full fledged player on the international scale and that has been denied for one reason well two reasons the military industrial complex whenever we need sales to South Korea or in that region
[01:42:59.460 --> 01:43:12.460]  oh we have all kinds of problems they have miniaturized nukes so it's a trigger point and then then we sell now we've been trying to sell the new president Park had been very difficult he didn't want any missile defense
[01:43:12.460 --> 01:43:26.460]  we of course want missile defense there to keep our eye on China North Korea is not suicidal I also don't think the president's words meant nuclear war I love the words he chose fury and fire and
[01:43:26.460 --> 01:43:42.460]  fury is like a really hot valkyrie of war it conjures up images he didn't say we're going to nuke you and to me personally I think it may be another move in his negotiation because all he has to do is let Kim Jong Un save face one way or the other
[01:43:42.460 --> 01:43:51.460]  and we may see that happen I'm just not we're going to play that clip in a moment but I'm going to tell you Adam this is amazing analysis because I mean what you're saying is really what's going on
[01:43:51.460 --> 01:44:04.460]  I believe so and it works you know because we all get riled up and I was in Europe for a couple of weeks and man no one was interested in talking about Trump really they were scared to death of North Korea oh my god what's the crazy guy going to do
[01:44:04.460 --> 01:44:19.460]  you don't hear it quite that way in the United States oh that's because most of Europe got burned down just 60 70 years ago they still have that memory but also why is it that all of a sudden he can reach Hawaii this the same report came out three years ago the same thing
[01:44:19.460 --> 01:44:32.460]  they have a nuke and they might be able to reach or ICB and now they can hit Chicago but you know why it's Hawaii Tulsi Gabbard because she's you know the Democrats he's not playing along she's anti-war she's
[01:44:32.460 --> 01:44:47.460]  she's in Hawaii let's just make Hawaii a little bit more dangerous I think this is this truly is a big move in the information war I'm not quite sure what side all the players are on yet but definitely it's about weapons weapons sales spy stuff focused in that region
[01:44:47.460 --> 01:45:01.460]  I normally only play clip once a show we played probably already five times let's play that clip of Trump yesterday surreal with his gorgeous supermodel wife looking a little bit Jack Nicholson he is pretty scary you're going to see a little bit of the real
[01:45:01.460 --> 01:45:08.460]  Trump when he's angry but talking about fire and fury and power pretty scary stuff here it is
[01:45:08.460 --> 01:45:27.460]  North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States they will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen he has been very threatening beyond a normal state
[01:45:27.460 --> 01:45:44.460]  and as I said they will be met with fire fury and frankly power the likes of which this world has never seen before now Adam Curry of the no agenda show.com father of the podcast system
[01:45:44.460 --> 01:45:58.460]  I want to get your take on the web and internet and censorship and where you think that's going she's been a trailblazer and of course he's also known for being a big DJ and MTV and pioneering that but what you said earlier about what you think Trump is doing is smart
[01:45:58.460 --> 01:46:11.460]  Rex Tillerson was getting on a plane leaving Asia last night and he responded and he said well we hope to calm things down and but North Korea keeps threatening to blow everybody up and nothing else has gotten through to him so maybe this will
[01:46:11.460 --> 01:46:19.460]  so so is there true to that or is it like Merkel says calm down take pro's act from everything's your fault
[01:46:19.460 --> 01:46:34.460]  well obviously there are problems and I go back to my original premise the problem is we want to have stuff in that area to keep our on China which really is China is I think is dangerous I mean that there's stuff going on that we really don't understand don't know much about
[01:46:34.460 --> 01:46:47.460]  and man do we have cultural differences incredible cultural differences with the Chinese Chinese tourists I was in in Florence they're spitting on the ground they're hawking everywhere they're rude they push you around
[01:46:47.460 --> 01:46:55.460]  that's their culture they don't deem that to be rude we are very incompatible from everything that I've seen and I'm just talking about the people that come to
[01:46:55.460 --> 01:47:08.460]  and that's the thing I'm not bashing Chinese people my sister's Korean adopted but she's completely different than people you run into or from Korea where it's a total caste society men are like totally in charge the liberals don't care about that that's fine
[01:47:08.460 --> 01:47:21.460]  and I mean it's almost like a hive or something they're very smart people but it's like a beehive then you talk to Paul Watson he was married to a Chinese lady for a while and he went there a lot and I'm not going to get into the whole story but they sort of get messages from China watch what you're saying
[01:47:21.460 --> 01:47:29.460]  even though they didn't the family didn't even live in China they were visiting people and he said exactly even the nice area people just pull their pants down start crapping push you out of the way
[01:47:29.460 --> 01:47:43.460]  the biggest group is Chinese women coming here to have babies for free that's there's more Chinese women than all Mexicans coming here I mean it's insane California this happens a lot and we're such an open good society I'm not being xenophobic
[01:47:43.460 --> 01:47:57.460]  I'm saying you go to China ask for something for free the police cut your testicles off stab you in each thigh artery and wait for you to bleed to death but that's the standard deal cut your testicles off if you're a man stab you in each what is an ephemeral artery and let you bleed out
[01:47:57.460 --> 01:48:01.460]  I'm canceling my chip to trip to China this is not a good place to be
[01:48:01.460 --> 01:48:07.460]  well you showed your astuteness so I'm ranting sorry get back into get back into all the players and now they're threatening war with India
[01:48:07.460 --> 01:48:15.460]  that that is probably more precarious I mean when you get into India and Pakistan
[01:48:15.460 --> 01:48:27.460]  these are the the nuclear powers that I believe we should be wary of not necessarily you know all freaking out but you know that has been a big issue for a long time and that's we know that they have nuclear weapons
[01:48:27.460 --> 01:48:39.460]  we're not I mean a report came out and I'm great address America and camera for it's really always about selling stuff so that we can kill brown people in sandy areas
[01:48:39.460 --> 01:48:52.460]  and then what's the cultural deal with bringing in the most radical battle-harden males while you're while you're attaching and stirring up Islam and putting radicals in then why do you then flood Europe with military aged men running around like pirate ships docking
[01:48:52.460 --> 01:49:05.460]  well I think well that that's different and that is part of the Colergy plan and if you've ever heard of that Colergy plan and they still give out awards the Colergy award for furthering the European Union
[01:49:05.460 --> 01:49:17.460]  Merkel won that recently. They want to expand that into the Middle East. Well and the idea is to create a uniform it literally calls for people who look like Egyptians brown and that's happening
[01:49:17.460 --> 01:49:29.460]  I grew up in Amsterdam and I saw the transition. First it was Turkish and then Moroccan and now we have you know second third generation kids born in the Netherlands and people just start to become browns.
[01:49:29.460 --> 01:49:44.460]  The culture kind of flow the whole multicultural society that was the idea is to have a big mass of people bringing people who can do the work that the old people the white whitish people the Europeans as we know them don't want to do
[01:49:44.460 --> 01:49:55.460]  really create a big and and I'm not making this up and this is not you know not conspiracy Peter Sutherland and the head of the EU's now the head of the cultural enrichment program open borders so they actually call it said we've got it in
[01:49:55.460 --> 01:50:07.460]  Europe being white but here's the thing they don't want to get rid of the culture of big beautiful buildings and juries and and property I mean they're bringing in the muscles because they want to make it authoritarian.
[01:50:07.460 --> 01:50:18.460]  And that's what the elites always want to do they want to make sure that people you know are quiet docile and don't steal their stuff and just go along with the pro and the elites they're never going to have their kids marrying
[01:50:18.460 --> 01:50:29.460]  look at what happened just the creation of the European Union with the Lisbon treaty. France said no the Netherlands said no. Okay that's too bad. Let's do that vote over again. Ireland said no.
[01:50:29.460 --> 01:50:39.460]  Let's do it again. Let's do it again. Much better. It's like Brexit. We're doing it again. I've been waiting for that maybe to happen. They're saying let me have another vote now because it's not clear.
[01:50:39.460 --> 01:50:47.460]  Well now this referendum was done right. I was stupid people. That's what I read in the independent stupid people who voted for Brexit who are undereducated.
[01:50:47.460 --> 01:51:02.460]  Well notice they could have easily shipped people in from somewhere in Asia or Brazil or something that would be more cultural compatible with Europe but they literally say we want the worst Muslim countries were totally barbarous let's ship them in and have them be the new bosses.
[01:51:02.460 --> 01:51:28.460]  We'll be right back with Adam Curry.

[01:54:33.460 --> 01:54:47.460]  Allergies are getting worse and worse all over the world. They know it's connected to GMOs and other things. We'll talk about that with a really smart guy Adam Curry who was in there like a year ago and I thought I want to get this guy on every week and then just a year goes by like 10 seconds and I remember to get him back.
[01:54:47.460 --> 01:55:06.460]  He's a fellow Austinite, Curry.com, NoGenishow.com, very, very popular podcast reaching millions of people every week. The podcast father and he's here to talk about now censorship, where he sees all this going. It's so surreal not to make myself a center of attention but seriously to have the Federal Elections Commission.
[01:55:06.460 --> 01:55:25.460]  We want subpoenas of Jones and his Russian funding. It's like surreal to be in a 7 days in May movie but we're all in it and now Google and everybody admits they're going to censor and they call it left wing versus right wing but it's really anybody that's saying I wouldn't call you right wing.
[01:55:25.460 --> 01:55:39.460]  What is currently happening? You're a pioneer in television and MTV, in computers, in independent broadcasting and podcasting called the Podfather. Where would you say we are right now?
[01:55:39.460 --> 01:55:54.460]  Well in the United States we're an interesting point. Just to go back to the European Union they have a whole tolerance directive which was launched several years ago and from this stems the laws that are not allowed to say negative things about migrants or refugees.
[01:55:54.460 --> 01:56:01.460]  So they're getting rid of the soccer teams having national names. You're also telling me about the Anthem and they've now changed that.
[01:56:01.460 --> 01:56:12.460]  Oh well that was just part of what we're talking about the Kalergy plan. The plan was to make Beethoven's ode to joy the national anthem of the European Union. That plan was written quite a while ago and today it is fact.
[01:56:12.460 --> 01:56:13.460]  Just to kind of show you that.
[01:56:13.460 --> 01:56:15.460]  Just to show, they're following this.
[01:56:15.460 --> 01:56:20.460]  Implement it. Now when it comes to censorship in the United States there's something a little more nefarious going on.
[01:56:20.460 --> 01:56:34.460]  Once again the debate has been reignited about net neutrality. This is a plan to regulate the internet and it's done in such a great way and by the way it's completely paid for all of these organizations, fight for the future, all of that.
[01:56:34.460 --> 01:56:46.460]  They're all small NGOs that are funded by Google and by Amazon and other big players in the internet space in the United States.
[01:56:46.460 --> 01:56:53.460]  The idea is under the guise of oh everything should be equal, everything should be fair, they're going to be able to regulate.
[01:56:53.460 --> 01:57:03.460]  And once you get one foot in the door to write one rule and it's disguised as everything will be okay except for illegal traffic on the computer network.
[01:57:03.460 --> 01:57:08.460]  So what's illegal traffic? Right now it's not defined but that could be bit torrent, it could be.
[01:57:08.460 --> 01:57:16.460]  I've gotten the point where I have to follow all suit now, we're just looking at what company, every major company we go to for credit card processing.
[01:57:16.460 --> 01:57:23.460]  This is the problem, they're going to go after the money, so they're going after all the places where you can get money to fund your operation.
[01:57:23.460 --> 01:57:27.460]  Just like what happened with WikiLeaks and PayPal is exactly the same thing.
[01:57:27.460 --> 01:57:37.460]  So it's an act of resistance, I haven't plugged once this hour, you go to infowarstore.com, seriously great supplements, great products, great organic coffee, t-shirts, air filtration.
[01:57:37.460 --> 01:57:40.460]  I'm jacked up on male vitality pills right now, Alex.
[01:57:40.460 --> 01:57:47.460]  Well, it looks like you're a pretty virile guy but I'll tell you, it has certainly helped me big time.
[01:57:47.460 --> 01:57:52.460]  I'm not kidding, I've tried them, I got a whole box last time, absolutely, DNA repair, the whole deal.
[01:57:52.460 --> 01:57:58.460]  Well, I mean, we go out and find out whatever the top of the line stuff is and then we private label it or develop it.
[01:57:58.460 --> 01:58:00.460]  I'm 70, look at me.
[01:58:00.460 --> 01:58:02.460]  You were not 70.
[01:58:02.460 --> 01:58:05.460]  You look younger than me and I know, listen, I've put myself there a lot.
[01:58:05.460 --> 01:58:07.460]  You're younger than me, I know you're younger.
[01:58:07.460 --> 01:58:09.460]  I mean, I've had my face beat in probably 100 times.
[01:58:09.460 --> 01:58:11.460]  It never happened to me, thank God.
[01:58:11.460 --> 01:58:14.460]  Yeah, it's a good thing, I used to look different, you look different before I got my face beat in.
[01:58:14.460 --> 01:58:19.460]  You were a good looking guy, I saw a picture when you were like, you know, maybe in your 20s, holy crap.
[01:58:19.460 --> 01:58:21.460]  It's all bashed in and all beat in, it's good though.
[01:58:21.460 --> 01:58:22.460]  Hot looking baby.
[01:58:22.460 --> 01:58:23.460]  Hot, hot, hot.
[01:58:23.460 --> 01:58:27.460]  Well, we're gonna go out later, I'll give you a signed photo, stop it out here.
[01:58:27.460 --> 01:58:28.460]  We're gay, it's all true.
[01:58:28.460 --> 01:58:29.460]  Yeah, there you go.
[01:58:29.460 --> 01:58:32.460]  Hey, ladies and gentlemen, and then we'll be kicked off the ever being homophobic now, it's a joke.
[01:58:32.460 --> 01:58:36.460]  Just like they're probably gonna kick a mile off from being homophobic, seriously, they're saying yes, we're making gay jokes.
[01:58:36.460 --> 01:58:41.460]  It's free for all, it's America, it's free speech, it's Adam Curry, the founder of God Jasting.
[01:58:41.460 --> 01:58:45.460]  Your phone calls and more in hour number three, stay with us.
[01:58:47.460 --> 01:58:49.460]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:50.460 --> 01:58:53.460]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[01:58:53.460 --> 01:59:00.460]  More than two years ago, Info Wars first told you about our research into what has been called the iodine conspiracy.
[01:59:00.460 --> 01:59:06.460]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ
[01:59:06.460 --> 01:59:11.460]  and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride,
[01:59:11.460 --> 01:59:14.460]  the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[01:59:14.460 --> 01:59:17.460]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[01:59:17.460 --> 01:59:24.460]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[01:59:24.460 --> 01:59:31.460]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut,
[01:59:31.460 --> 01:59:37.460]  which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[01:59:37.460 --> 01:59:39.460]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[01:59:39.460 --> 01:59:43.460]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view,
[01:59:43.460 --> 01:59:49.460]  to any optimum health regimen. Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at InfoWarsLife.com,
[01:59:49.460 --> 02:00:18.460]  or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:00:18.460 --> 02:00:23.460]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:00:23.460 --> 02:00:26.460]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he.
[02:00:26.460 --> 02:00:34.460]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:34.460 --> 02:00:36.460]  Adam Curry's our guest.
[02:00:36.460 --> 02:00:40.460]  Coming up, we're going to take your phone call specifically on North Korea.
[02:00:40.460 --> 02:00:43.460]  What do you think about it? Where do you think it's going?
[02:00:43.460 --> 02:00:47.460]  We know that the globalists are making money off of it, manipulating it, using it as a trigger point.
[02:00:47.460 --> 02:00:53.460]  Kim Jong-un looks like a demonic ferret. He kills his family members with poison and mortar attacks.
[02:00:53.460 --> 02:00:58.460]  He's threatening to nuke everybody. It's just comical, like cartoon world, to watch it.
[02:00:58.460 --> 02:01:02.460]  But it's real. But remember, most of those people are brainwashed slaves
[02:01:02.460 --> 02:01:04.460]  and literally don't know what planet they're on.
[02:01:04.460 --> 02:01:07.460]  So Adam Curry getting back to that and back into the censorship.
[02:01:07.460 --> 02:01:10.460]  Nothing is as good for censorship as a big war.
[02:01:10.460 --> 02:01:12.460]  What if things get out of hand?
[02:01:12.460 --> 02:01:16.460]  You were getting into Trump saying he was pretty smart what he's doing. What do you think?
[02:01:16.460 --> 02:01:19.460]  Again, I like the words that he used in this case.
[02:01:19.460 --> 02:01:25.460]  And I have thought for quite a while that the idea would be...
[02:01:25.460 --> 02:01:28.460]  And Park in South Korea is definitely...
[02:01:28.460 --> 02:01:35.460]  I think he's amenable to the idea of a reunification before this recent event.
[02:01:35.460 --> 02:01:40.460]  He was talking about having North and South Koreans together on an Olympic team.
[02:01:40.460 --> 02:01:43.460]  So that, of course, I'm amazed the guy's still alive, quite honestly.
[02:01:43.460 --> 02:01:47.460]  So now this has been flipped. And I don't know about this report,
[02:01:47.460 --> 02:01:53.460]  that the nuclear weapons I understood they may have were really large.
[02:01:53.460 --> 02:01:56.460]  And now they've miniaturized them to put theater on ICBM.
[02:01:56.460 --> 02:01:58.460]  I don't really see any analysis of that report.
[02:01:58.460 --> 02:02:01.460]  Where did it come from? Who wrote it? What's the deal with it?
[02:02:01.460 --> 02:02:03.460]  It seems very convenient to have that.
[02:02:03.460 --> 02:02:05.460]  Very WMD-ish in Iraq.
[02:02:05.460 --> 02:02:09.460]  Yeah, aluminum tubes and yellow cake and all that kind of stuff.
[02:02:09.460 --> 02:02:11.460]  And they got a reactor buried under a rose bush.
[02:02:11.460 --> 02:02:14.460]  I haven't actually had the opportunity to see where the report came from.
[02:02:14.460 --> 02:02:16.460]  What's the genesis of that report? I really don't know.
[02:02:16.460 --> 02:02:18.460]  And it's not discussed on the mainstream.
[02:02:18.460 --> 02:02:22.460]  So what are the real crisis points that I think it's India and China threatening a new war?
[02:02:22.460 --> 02:02:25.460]  Yeah, I would say we have to look for that.
[02:02:25.460 --> 02:02:33.460]  This duck-and-cover mentality that is kind of building, again, in Europe, first and foremost,
[02:02:33.460 --> 02:02:35.460]  I'm just not a believer in it.
[02:02:35.460 --> 02:02:38.460]  Why do you think in Europe where you say you were just worried that they're so freaked out?
[02:02:38.460 --> 02:02:42.460]  I've been around Europeans. When I was out in Hawaii, I ran into French and some Dutch.
[02:02:42.460 --> 02:02:45.460]  And they were all, Kim Jong-un, madman must stop him.
[02:02:45.460 --> 02:02:48.460]  And I'm like, well, of course, obviously he is a madman, but I mean...
[02:02:48.460 --> 02:02:55.460]  Well, in general, and I read Dutch and German and English and to some degree some French,
[02:02:55.460 --> 02:02:57.460]  I can see how the...
[02:02:57.460 --> 02:02:59.460]  Are you sure it's your uncle who was in the CIA?
[02:02:59.460 --> 02:03:01.460]  You know, I was waiting for that.
[02:03:01.460 --> 02:03:04.460]  I am the black sheep of the family, sadly.
[02:03:04.460 --> 02:03:05.460]  I'm just joking.
[02:03:05.460 --> 02:03:08.460]  Listen to this. I'm at family reunions.
[02:03:08.460 --> 02:03:09.460]  You're too good for the CIA.
[02:03:09.460 --> 02:03:10.460]  Family reunions.
[02:03:10.460 --> 02:03:15.460]  And then some, you know, nephew, back, cousin, whatever will say,
[02:03:15.460 --> 02:03:17.460]  yeah, I can't talk about that because you don't have clearance.
[02:03:17.460 --> 02:03:19.460]  And I have to leave the room in my family reunion.
[02:03:19.460 --> 02:03:21.460]  And they act like they're all cool.
[02:03:21.460 --> 02:03:24.460]  When most of the stuff they got is the same stuff that's out there.
[02:03:24.460 --> 02:03:25.460]  Probably.
[02:03:25.460 --> 02:03:26.460]  You know, they use pretty clearance.
[02:03:26.460 --> 02:03:28.460]  You'd have echo chambers of BS.
[02:03:28.460 --> 02:03:29.460]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:03:29.460 --> 02:03:30.460]  So they can really put out some mold.
[02:03:30.460 --> 02:03:35.460]  Let me tell you, when it comes to Russia, wow, they really have an incredible...
[02:03:35.460 --> 02:03:39.460]  My family, an incredible hatred of Russia, completely see Putin...
[02:03:39.460 --> 02:03:45.460]  Where does that come from when it was Western intellectuals that infested Russia with Bolshevik garbage?
[02:03:45.460 --> 02:03:46.460]  I can tell you.
[02:03:46.460 --> 02:03:50.460]  Like we gave Russia AIDS, and then they tried to give it back to us.
[02:03:50.460 --> 02:03:58.460]  Well, my family certainly, all living in the D.C. area, they remember very well having to go into the basement
[02:03:58.460 --> 02:04:03.460]  when they heated up with the Cold War, and certainly the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[02:04:03.460 --> 02:04:05.460]  They've been through their...
[02:04:05.460 --> 02:04:06.460]  The 10 minutes of hate.
[02:04:06.460 --> 02:04:09.460]  Yeah, well, it's post-traumatic stress disorder.
[02:04:09.460 --> 02:04:12.460]  And when you have that, and that's something we should actually talk about,
[02:04:12.460 --> 02:04:15.460]  post-traumatic stress disorder can come from a number of things.
[02:04:15.460 --> 02:04:17.460]  It can come from eating disorders.
[02:04:17.460 --> 02:04:22.460]  It can come from severe psychological impacts that have happened to you.
[02:04:22.460 --> 02:04:27.460]  I think that Hillary Clinton losing the election created an enormous...
[02:04:27.460 --> 02:04:29.460]  Trump Derangement Syndrome.
[02:04:29.460 --> 02:04:31.460]  I'm just going to look at PTSD.
[02:04:31.460 --> 02:04:36.460]  The thing about PTSD is when you get it, it actually changes the nature of your brain.
[02:04:36.460 --> 02:04:42.460]  Your hippocampus, you know, the frontal cortex starts to shrink, and the amygdala starts to grow,
[02:04:42.460 --> 02:04:43.460]  and the synapses...
[02:04:43.460 --> 02:04:47.460]  So they're going back to the more crocodile brain, and this is causing the TDS.
[02:04:47.460 --> 02:04:51.460]  And then words that seem threatening are perceived as actual violence,
[02:04:51.460 --> 02:04:53.460]  and often are returned with actual violence.
[02:04:53.460 --> 02:04:58.460]  Well, let's talk about TDS and how it's spreading, because whether you love Trump or hate him,
[02:04:58.460 --> 02:05:01.460]  I mean, he basically has a JFK model of economics and stuff.
[02:05:01.460 --> 02:05:03.460]  He's the guy who's not really even a Republican.
[02:05:03.460 --> 02:05:28.460]  I believe every good journalist needs to know why the Second Amendment must be considered more essential than the First Amendment.
[02:05:28.460 --> 02:05:35.460]  This may be a bitter pill to swallow, but the right to keep and bear arms is not an outdated, dusty idea
[02:05:35.460 --> 02:05:39.460]  some old dead white guys dreamed up in fear of the Redcoats.
[02:05:39.460 --> 02:05:44.460]  No, it is just as essential to liberty today as it was in 1776.
[02:05:44.460 --> 02:05:51.460]  The original amendments we refer to as the Bill of Rights contain ten of what the constitutional framers termed unalienable rights.
[02:05:51.460 --> 02:05:54.460]  The Bill of Rights came to us with blinders on.
[02:05:54.460 --> 02:05:57.460]  It doesn't recognize color or class or wealth.
[02:05:57.460 --> 02:06:01.460]  It protects not just the rights of actors or editors or reporters,
[02:06:01.460 --> 02:06:04.460]  but extends even to those we love to hate.
[02:06:04.460 --> 02:06:06.460]  This is a small excerpt from Charlton Heston.
[02:06:06.460 --> 02:06:11.460]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[02:06:11.460 --> 02:06:14.460]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research,
[02:06:14.460 --> 02:06:19.460]  I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact
[02:06:19.460 --> 02:06:24.460]  that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[02:06:24.460 --> 02:06:31.460]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[02:06:31.460 --> 02:06:37.460]  And so I set out to develop caveman, but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken,
[02:06:37.460 --> 02:06:44.460]  but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[02:06:44.460 --> 02:06:47.460]  Info wars isn't just fighting the globalist.
[02:06:47.460 --> 02:06:52.460]  We're getting results and we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault
[02:06:52.460 --> 02:06:54.460]  and winning because of your support.
[02:06:54.460 --> 02:06:57.460]  Caveman is finally back at the info war store.
[02:06:57.460 --> 02:07:02.460]  You can get 25% off the regular price for a limited time only at infowarslife.com
[02:07:02.460 --> 02:07:06.460]  or by calling toll free triple A 253 3139.
[02:07:06.460 --> 02:07:10.460]  A new shipment of bio truth selenium is now available at infowarslife.com.
[02:07:10.460 --> 02:07:12.460]  We've been sold out for months.
[02:07:12.460 --> 02:07:17.460]  Our one of a kind info wars life bio truth selenium formula is now back in stock at infowarslife.com.
[02:07:17.460 --> 02:07:21.460]  This is the true selenium formula that has rocked the pharmaceutical industry to its core.
[02:07:21.460 --> 02:07:25.460]  Nearly every other selenium supplement on the market is produced with synthetic selenium,
[02:07:25.460 --> 02:07:31.460]  but bio truth selenium is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[02:07:31.460 --> 02:07:34.460]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are well known
[02:07:34.460 --> 02:07:38.460]  from supporting the thyroid gland and immune system to DNA production and eyesight.
[02:07:38.460 --> 02:07:43.460]  Bio truth selenium is also the perfect supercharger to survival shield X2 nascent iodine
[02:07:43.460 --> 02:07:46.460]  as both help support a healthy thyroid and many other systems.
[02:07:46.460 --> 02:07:51.460]  Visit infowarslife.com to order your bottle of bio truth selenium before we sell it again.
[02:07:51.460 --> 02:07:55.460]  That's infowarslife.com to secure your selenium and other key products
[02:07:55.460 --> 02:08:00.460]  that don't only help yourself and your family, but also fund our operation against the globalist A360 wind.
[02:08:00.460 --> 02:08:02.460]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight.
[02:08:02.460 --> 02:08:27.460]  This is the time to support InfoWars. That's infowarslife.com.
[02:08:27.460 --> 02:08:32.460]  Adam Curry is an impressive guy, not just a famous MTV host and radio DJ,
[02:08:32.460 --> 02:08:38.460]  but also a learned fellow who's traveled the world and is the father of podcasting.
[02:08:38.460 --> 02:08:43.460]  We're going to be taking your phone calls here in a few minutes on North Korea specifically
[02:08:43.460 --> 02:08:45.460]  and global crises.
[02:08:45.460 --> 02:08:48.460]  Trump inherited this. He didn't give the missiles and the reactors in North Korea
[02:08:48.460 --> 02:08:51.460]  for the strategy of tension, so we have an excuse to be there.
[02:08:51.460 --> 02:08:55.460]  The strategy of tension is the right word. Absolutely.
[02:08:55.460 --> 02:09:00.460]  But now it still is a monster that's been appeased. Obama appeased him so much.
[02:09:00.460 --> 02:09:05.460]  Kim Jong-un and, of course, a lot of experts say that Kim Jong-il was somewhat controlled by China,
[02:09:05.460 --> 02:09:08.460]  but there's a major breakaway happening.
[02:09:08.460 --> 02:09:10.460]  From your research, what do you think?
[02:09:10.460 --> 02:09:15.460]  Well, I come back to what I learned from my uncle who dealt with this
[02:09:15.460 --> 02:09:19.460]  and he's been to North Korea five times or six times in the past five years.
[02:09:19.460 --> 02:09:26.460]  In his 80s, he's met with many people. I think he's part of the North Korea Society,
[02:09:26.460 --> 02:09:31.460]  which is a think tank, obviously, but with commerce, because what North Korea really would want,
[02:09:31.460 --> 02:09:34.460]  what they really, really would want is to be a tourist destination.
[02:09:34.460 --> 02:09:37.460]  Remember, they had the ski lifts all ready to go.
[02:09:37.460 --> 02:09:40.460]  And the culture is they like pretty signs and little pretty flowers.
[02:09:40.460 --> 02:09:44.460]  Pyongyang is beautiful. I haven't been, but it looks really nice.
[02:09:44.460 --> 02:09:46.460]  I hear a lot. I've never been.
[02:09:46.460 --> 02:09:48.460]  A lot of insane communist buildings.
[02:09:48.460 --> 02:09:49.460]  I don't know. I mean, I really...
[02:09:49.460 --> 02:09:51.460]  Here's the toll-free number. I forgot. I'm sorry to interrupt.
[02:09:51.460 --> 02:09:56.460]  800-25-99-231-800-25-99-231.
[02:09:56.460 --> 02:10:00.460]  Just please be first-time callers. I want to give folks a chance to have them able to get on.
[02:10:00.460 --> 02:10:02.460]  What is your view on North Korea? What's happening?
[02:10:02.460 --> 02:10:06.460]  The media trying to blame Trump for it. I'm not here to defend Trump, but it's crazy.
[02:10:06.460 --> 02:10:10.460]  Where do you think this North Korea thing is going to go if there's not a war?
[02:10:10.460 --> 02:10:13.460]  I hope there's not a war, but it just seems to be escalating.
[02:10:13.460 --> 02:10:18.460]  Well, what I was starting to look in before I came in for the show today was, you know,
[02:10:18.460 --> 02:10:20.460]  where is some other military moves happening?
[02:10:20.460 --> 02:10:24.460]  This could also be a bit of, again, going back to where did this report come from,
[02:10:24.460 --> 02:10:28.460]  that all of a sudden he's miniaturized the nukes, and we should be really afraid.
[02:10:28.460 --> 02:10:31.460]  The president's words were not off the cuff.
[02:10:31.460 --> 02:10:34.460]  I mean, he chose those words, and he has a strategy behind it,
[02:10:34.460 --> 02:10:36.460]  because you just don't come up with those words like that.
[02:10:36.460 --> 02:10:39.460]  I just don't think... I think everything he says is very well thought out.
[02:10:39.460 --> 02:10:44.460]  Obama was the king of that, because he would say something. You go back three years,
[02:10:44.460 --> 02:10:50.460]  and he said it in a way that absolutely could be interpreted the way that he claimed it to be.
[02:10:50.460 --> 02:10:56.460]  And I think that the words fire and fury and power doesn't mean we're going to attack.
[02:10:56.460 --> 02:10:59.460]  It doesn't mean a nuclear war. We have been flying around.
[02:10:59.460 --> 02:11:02.460]  We do all kinds of sorties. We do, I mean, ship submarines.
[02:11:02.460 --> 02:11:05.460]  And again, there's no... there's never been...
[02:11:05.460 --> 02:11:09.460]  North Korea, for all intents and purposes, is still at war. We just have an armistice.
[02:11:09.460 --> 02:11:14.460]  That's why Trump's saying the policy is maximum pressure and maximum engagement.
[02:11:14.460 --> 02:11:19.460]  And all that has to happen is he has to make a deal, and I think that the president's thinking, I hope,
[02:11:19.460 --> 02:11:23.460]  I could be wrong, and if I'm wrong, it doesn't matter, because we'll all be dead,
[02:11:23.460 --> 02:11:25.460]  and then who cares what I said?
[02:11:25.460 --> 02:11:32.460]  I think his idea is to pressure Kim Jong-un into giving up his nuclear arsenal, whatever it is,
[02:11:32.460 --> 02:11:37.460]  under the auspices of let Kim Jong-un reunify the North and the South.
[02:11:37.460 --> 02:11:41.460]  And maybe like Hong Kong in 100 years or 90 years.
[02:11:41.460 --> 02:11:43.460]  Like, we're going to make a deal, we'll be like Germany.
[02:11:43.460 --> 02:11:47.460]  And that's exactly... Trump at first said, he's a smart cookie, let's work together.
[02:11:47.460 --> 02:11:50.460]  And Kim Jong-un said, I'll nuke, I'll blow you up, I'll kill you.
[02:11:50.460 --> 02:11:53.460]  I mean, he is the one that is initiating things.
[02:11:53.460 --> 02:11:55.460]  I know McMaster then says we may have to perfectly strike.
[02:11:55.460 --> 02:11:57.460]  Well, yeah, if we're going to hit him, we better hit him first.
[02:11:57.460 --> 02:12:00.460]  Or they're going to blow up Seoul, South Korea.
[02:12:00.460 --> 02:12:02.460]  McMaster is a wild card for me.
[02:12:02.460 --> 02:12:05.460]  I don't know too much about this guy, I don't know if I like him.
[02:12:05.460 --> 02:12:10.460]  We've confirmed he is giving reports to Soros and was on a Soros Major Foundation.
[02:12:10.460 --> 02:12:15.460]  And this is so interesting that 10 years ago, when I started our show, No Agenda Show,
[02:12:15.460 --> 02:12:18.460]  of course, heard you well before we even started that.
[02:12:18.460 --> 02:12:20.460]  All these things that we were...
[02:12:20.460 --> 02:12:23.460]  Oh, your conspiracy theories, you're completely nuts.
[02:12:23.460 --> 02:12:26.460]  All these things like Soros is a great example.
[02:12:26.460 --> 02:12:28.460]  Everything's Soros, everything's Soros.
[02:12:28.460 --> 02:12:30.460]  Yeah, you're crazy, and now you can...
[02:12:30.460 --> 02:12:32.460]  I can't believe how it's all him.
[02:12:32.460 --> 02:12:34.460]  I don't know how in almost 90, this guy is like...
[02:12:34.460 --> 02:12:35.460]  It's amazing.
[02:12:35.460 --> 02:12:37.460]  He is in everything. I mean, he really is him.
[02:12:37.460 --> 02:12:40.460]  Yeah, well, it's Open Society Institute and all of the...
[02:12:40.460 --> 02:12:43.460]  The CIA groups and all the foundations and all the other billionaires.
[02:12:43.460 --> 02:12:45.460]  He's kind of the figurehead of it.
[02:12:45.460 --> 02:12:48.460]  Yeah, well, I don't know how much he...
[02:12:48.460 --> 02:12:52.460]  He must operate a lot of it himself, but really, if you look at all of the groups
[02:12:52.460 --> 02:12:55.460]  that have a million, a million and a half dollars from him,
[02:12:55.460 --> 02:12:59.460]  that organize protests, that do everything that is generally set up
[02:12:59.460 --> 02:13:02.460]  to benefit his trade of usually foreign exchange...
[02:13:02.460 --> 02:13:08.460]  And that's always a cutout for media to point at the astrotruthic credit and illusion.
[02:13:08.460 --> 02:13:12.460]  Always, always. And he's doing it on behalf of the global elites
[02:13:12.460 --> 02:13:15.460]  who want no nations, no borders, everybody be the same,
[02:13:15.460 --> 02:13:19.460]  have the same culture, be quiet, just move on, carry on.
[02:13:19.460 --> 02:13:23.460]  And the reason Info Wars is here is I want a true open liberal society,
[02:13:23.460 --> 02:13:26.460]  Thomas Jefferson-style, and think there should be somebody
[02:13:26.460 --> 02:13:30.460]  for the American people, for Renaissance, for free market,
[02:13:30.460 --> 02:13:33.460]  for individual property in the Second Amendment and religious freedom
[02:13:33.460 --> 02:13:35.460]  to be religious or not be religious.
[02:13:35.460 --> 02:13:37.460]  And that's, to me, we're true liberals.
[02:13:37.460 --> 02:13:40.460]  And the whole corporate power structure has found
[02:13:40.460 --> 02:13:43.460]  their real opposition was from true Western liberalism.
[02:13:43.460 --> 02:13:47.460]  So that's why they fill the vacuum of, quote, liberalism
[02:13:47.460 --> 02:13:49.460]  because they, in truth, are corporate fascists.
[02:13:49.460 --> 02:13:55.460]  Yes, and technology is not going to end very well for us, I believe.
[02:13:55.460 --> 02:13:59.460]  I think it's already being used against us in many ways.
[02:13:59.460 --> 02:14:06.460]  Professor Theodore Kaczynski from Stanford.
[02:14:06.460 --> 02:14:07.460]  Turns out he was a prophet.
[02:14:07.460 --> 02:14:12.460]  If you ever read Industrial Revolution, Industrial Society, and its future,
[02:14:12.460 --> 02:14:15.460]  you'll understand that he predicted all of this would happen.
[02:14:15.460 --> 02:14:18.460]  And by the way, I'm not supporting the bombing or whatever it has not.
[02:14:18.460 --> 02:14:19.460]  That manifesto has nothing.
[02:14:19.460 --> 02:14:20.460]  Here's the difference.
[02:14:20.460 --> 02:14:21.460]  We don't know.
[02:14:21.460 --> 02:14:22.460]  He was in the CIA.
[02:14:22.460 --> 02:14:24.460]  But he was MK Ultra.
[02:14:24.460 --> 02:14:25.460]  Exactly.
[02:14:25.460 --> 02:14:26.460]  That's L.A. Times.
[02:14:26.460 --> 02:14:28.460]  You can't make, I tell people that.
[02:14:28.460 --> 02:14:30.460]  I think I even had, like, Time Magazine.
[02:14:30.460 --> 02:14:32.460]  I think it was, go, Jones is crazy.
[02:14:32.460 --> 02:14:34.460]  He said the Unabomber was MK Ultra.
[02:14:34.460 --> 02:14:36.460]  It was a fact.
[02:14:36.460 --> 02:14:40.460]  He was tortured psychologically, along with others.
[02:14:40.460 --> 02:14:41.460]  He volunteered into it.
[02:14:41.460 --> 02:14:42.460]  At school.
[02:14:42.460 --> 02:14:43.460]  At Stanford.
[02:14:43.460 --> 02:14:45.460]  But you don't, or is it Harvard?
[02:14:45.460 --> 02:14:49.460]  You don't know, you don't know you're signing on to it until lights out
[02:14:49.460 --> 02:14:51.460]  electro-pulskas of your brain.
[02:14:51.460 --> 02:14:53.460]  And six months later, you're released.
[02:14:53.460 --> 02:14:57.460]  Well, the psychological things that happened to him were very, very nasty.
[02:14:57.460 --> 02:15:01.460]  A lot of sexual deviants and, you know, an exposure of things.
[02:15:01.460 --> 02:15:03.460]  But back to what he wrote.
[02:15:03.460 --> 02:15:04.460]  That's what we've been told.
[02:15:04.460 --> 02:15:05.460]  That's what Alexander Cockburn dug up.
[02:15:05.460 --> 02:15:06.460]  Yes.
[02:15:06.460 --> 02:15:10.460]  But when I, much later in life, thought, you know, why would, why would this guy
[02:15:10.460 --> 02:15:14.460]  who, you know, went to the university, he became a professor, and he wrote
[02:15:14.460 --> 02:15:15.460]  something.
[02:15:15.460 --> 02:15:18.460]  Why would he go blow people up to get, because he wanted the New York Times to
[02:15:18.460 --> 02:15:19.460]  publish it in the Washington Post.
[02:15:19.460 --> 02:15:20.460]  That's all he wanted to do.
[02:15:20.460 --> 02:15:23.460]  And they did eventually publish it before they caught him.
[02:15:23.460 --> 02:15:25.460]  Imagine if he just waited around for the Internet.
[02:15:25.460 --> 02:15:26.460]  Right.
[02:15:26.460 --> 02:15:28.460]  So he, he went through all this trouble.
[02:15:28.460 --> 02:15:30.460]  But he already predicted social networks.
[02:15:30.460 --> 02:15:35.460]  He said the problem that we will face with technology is over-socialization.
[02:15:35.460 --> 02:15:37.460]  That's how the politically correct culture comes in.
[02:15:37.460 --> 02:15:42.460]  If you're over-socialized, like, you can't have, you can't say this about, use the
[02:15:42.460 --> 02:15:44.460]  wrong pronouns, address someone in the wrong manner.
[02:15:44.460 --> 02:15:45.460]  He's turning into a cult.
[02:15:45.460 --> 02:15:48.460]  But what happens is, there's so many things that you can do wrong, you're always
[02:15:48.460 --> 02:15:50.460]  thinking, oh my God, am I saying something wrong?
[02:15:50.460 --> 02:15:54.460]  So you have these filters on, and you become over-socialized, you're afraid to say,
[02:15:54.460 --> 02:15:56.460]  It's a panopticon effect.
[02:15:56.460 --> 02:15:58.460]  Now you're above my pay grade.
[02:15:58.460 --> 02:16:02.460]  No, no, that was the old French model of putting the guard tower in the middle in
[02:16:02.460 --> 02:16:05.460]  a circular prison, where you always think you're being watched.
[02:16:05.460 --> 02:16:06.460]  Yes.
[02:16:06.460 --> 02:16:07.460]  So you self-censored.
[02:16:07.460 --> 02:16:08.460]  Yes.
[02:16:08.460 --> 02:16:11.460]  And, and, and when he wrote the manifesto, he had no idea that social networks were
[02:16:11.460 --> 02:16:12.460]  coming.
[02:16:12.460 --> 02:16:17.460]  And you can see, I mean, I'm on FaceBag and Twitter, only to see what's happening,
[02:16:17.460 --> 02:16:21.460]  and to see how the algos are looking at me and what, and I think I'm pretty, I can
[02:16:21.460 --> 02:16:24.460]  protect myself, so I can step back a little bit from it.
[02:16:24.460 --> 02:16:26.460]  But man, it's some, it's some very, very dangerous.
[02:16:26.460 --> 02:16:28.460]  Can we tell you how good it is?
[02:16:28.460 --> 02:16:34.460]  I was looking at some discount furniture store thing online, like, you know, $500
[02:16:34.460 --> 02:16:38.460]  couches, I forget the name, but it's on my phone, on my little smart computer.
[02:16:38.460 --> 02:16:42.460]  And then I was up here and I was on Darren McBrain's computer because he was doing some
[02:16:42.460 --> 02:16:45.460]  stuff out of the room and I was watching some of the work he had on the screen, a little
[02:16:45.460 --> 02:16:48.460]  more video guys, great talent.
[02:16:48.460 --> 02:16:53.460]  And I was just, I went to a few sites and it knew and popped up that ad.
[02:16:53.460 --> 02:16:58.460]  So the algorithm is so smart that it knows, these are Alex Jones computers in general.
[02:16:58.460 --> 02:17:00.460]  And, and I asked him, I said, had that been popping up?
[02:17:00.460 --> 02:17:01.460]  He goes, no, that hadn't been popping up.
[02:17:01.460 --> 02:17:05.460]  And it was just because of where I went in like 20 minutes, it knew, oh, that's Alex
[02:17:05.460 --> 02:17:06.460]  and bloop.
[02:17:06.460 --> 02:17:07.460]  Possible.
[02:17:07.460 --> 02:17:11.460]  So it wasn't just targeted mapping of knowing already looked at something.
[02:17:11.460 --> 02:17:14.460]  So it followed me and then other sites that are in the network show it too.
[02:17:14.460 --> 02:17:18.460]  Now I'm not going to give them too much credit because I still, every single time I buy
[02:17:18.460 --> 02:17:21.460]  something, I get ads for the product that I just bought.
[02:17:21.460 --> 02:17:23.460]  So I'm not giving them a lot of credit.
[02:17:23.460 --> 02:17:24.460]  They know completely what they're doing.
[02:17:24.460 --> 02:17:26.460]  I just bought 10 cuckoo clocks.
[02:17:26.460 --> 02:17:29.460]  Then you should be seeing lots of cuckoo clock ads because that's how it works, which is
[02:17:29.460 --> 02:17:30.460]  very annoying.
[02:17:30.460 --> 02:17:34.460]  Although I understand from people that that actually does sell more products.
[02:17:34.460 --> 02:17:36.460]  Did you know I did just buy 10 cuckoo clocks?
[02:17:36.460 --> 02:17:37.460]  Cuckoo.
[02:17:37.460 --> 02:17:40.460]  My wife teased me about buying one.
[02:17:40.460 --> 02:17:42.460]  So I bought a lot of my friends one.
[02:17:42.460 --> 02:17:44.460]  It's, I thought this, it's my contribution.
[02:17:44.460 --> 02:17:46.460]  Now your wife has a mold allergy.
[02:17:46.460 --> 02:17:48.460]  Would you like a cuckoo clock?
[02:17:48.460 --> 02:17:49.460]  I love a cuckoo clock.
[02:17:49.460 --> 02:17:50.460]  Let me, let me, let me give your wife some help.
[02:17:50.460 --> 02:17:51.460]  All right.
[02:17:51.460 --> 02:17:55.460]  Because when I moved to Austin six years ago, the second year, it's never in the brochure.
[02:17:55.460 --> 02:17:57.460]  Austin, great city, young, fantastic.
[02:17:57.460 --> 02:17:59.460]  But the pollen's like nerve gas.
[02:17:59.460 --> 02:18:00.460]  Wow.
[02:18:00.460 --> 02:18:03.460]  I've never had any type of allergy in my life and mold hit me.
[02:18:03.460 --> 02:18:08.460]  So right now we've had three weeks of just 100% crazy off the chart mold.
[02:18:08.460 --> 02:18:09.460]  And you said, let me guess.
[02:18:09.460 --> 02:18:10.460]  Is she in bed?
[02:18:10.460 --> 02:18:11.460]  Is she sleeping 18 hours a day?
[02:18:11.460 --> 02:18:12.460]  Yeah.
[02:18:12.460 --> 02:18:13.460]  Is she having chills?
[02:18:13.460 --> 02:18:14.460]  That's it.
[02:18:14.460 --> 02:18:16.460]  And the doctor said you have mold, but then they give her some drug that doesn't work.
[02:18:16.460 --> 02:18:18.460]  And you said it's an herb.
[02:18:18.460 --> 02:18:21.460]  By the way, we don't own the company, but I'm going to go out and it works.
[02:18:21.460 --> 02:18:22.460]  I'm going to sell it.
[02:18:22.460 --> 02:18:24.460]  Corsetin is just the name of the, it's not a brand name.
[02:18:24.460 --> 02:18:27.460]  It's just the name of this herb, Q, U, E, R, C, I, T, I, N, I think Corsetin.
[02:18:27.460 --> 02:18:32.460]  And it's a natural, a natural product that will, I mean, the way it was explained to
[02:18:32.460 --> 02:18:33.460]  me.
[02:18:33.460 --> 02:18:34.460]  Anti-inflammatory.
[02:18:34.460 --> 02:18:35.460]  Yeah.
[02:18:35.460 --> 02:18:36.460]  Exactly.
[02:18:36.460 --> 02:18:37.460]  Strings your brain a little bit.
[02:18:37.460 --> 02:18:38.460]  But that's what the vaccines and everything are doing.
[02:18:38.460 --> 02:18:40.460]  The GMO, we're all having allergic responses.
[02:18:40.460 --> 02:18:41.460]  And so of course I should go to herbs.
[02:18:41.460 --> 02:18:42.460]  I know this.
[02:18:42.460 --> 02:18:43.460]  I'm going to do it myself.
[02:18:43.460 --> 02:18:46.460]  And then they demonize, oh mother earth, that doesn't work, but you're saying it worked
[02:18:46.460 --> 02:18:47.460]  for you.
[02:18:47.460 --> 02:18:48.460]  It's, I'm here.
[02:18:48.460 --> 02:18:52.460]  By the way, we're not selling Corsetin, though I will be within one month.
[02:18:52.460 --> 02:18:54.460]  And I'll buy it from you because it's a lifesaver.
[02:18:54.460 --> 02:18:55.460]  For me, it's a lifesaver.
[02:18:55.460 --> 02:18:57.460]  Anyone who has mold allergies specifically.
[02:18:57.460 --> 02:18:59.460]  So what happened when you started taking it?
[02:18:59.460 --> 02:19:01.460]  I didn't have the sleeping anymore.
[02:19:01.460 --> 02:19:02.460]  I didn't have the falling asleep.
[02:19:02.460 --> 02:19:07.460]  I was constantly just literally on the couch fall asleep, 12, 14 hours a day.
[02:19:07.460 --> 02:19:08.460]  I still have it.
[02:19:08.460 --> 02:19:10.460]  I can feel it coming on a little bit.
[02:19:10.460 --> 02:19:11.460]  Oh God.
[02:19:11.460 --> 02:19:15.460]  I live in a different apartment now, which is more closed off because we also have construction
[02:19:15.460 --> 02:19:16.460]  downtown.
[02:19:16.460 --> 02:19:17.460]  The Lord knows what's in the construction.
[02:19:17.460 --> 02:19:18.460]  Not good.
[02:19:18.460 --> 02:19:19.460]  None of them.
[02:19:19.460 --> 02:19:20.460]  Tearing down old buildings, not good.
[02:19:20.460 --> 02:19:22.460]  None of it can be good.
[02:19:22.460 --> 02:19:26.460]  And so if I feel it coming on, you know, I take four and I'm pretty good.
[02:19:26.460 --> 02:19:27.460]  Well, you've sold me.
[02:19:27.460 --> 02:19:28.460]  It works on my wife.
[02:19:28.460 --> 02:19:29.460]  You know, I've kind of power through it.
[02:19:29.460 --> 02:19:31.460]  We need no agenda question.
[02:19:31.460 --> 02:19:33.460]  I've got a business here.
[02:19:33.460 --> 02:19:35.460]  Austin is a hellhole of mold.
[02:19:35.460 --> 02:19:37.460]  The highest recorded on planet Earth.
[02:19:37.460 --> 02:19:38.460]  The mold's mutating.
[02:19:38.460 --> 02:19:44.460]  When you're not getting your incredible anti-mold system for your gut, that's the products at

[02:19:57.460 --> 02:20:00.460]  We're having a good time as Nuclear War Edges Closer.
[02:20:00.460 --> 02:20:03.460]  Yay, Kim Jong-un is so handsome.
[02:20:03.460 --> 02:20:06.460]  I'm not always gay, but if I am, I am.
[02:20:06.460 --> 02:20:07.460]  I ordered some Andro 400.
[02:20:07.460 --> 02:20:10.460]  I'm losing weight around the belly really quickly.
[02:20:10.460 --> 02:20:13.460]  Some of the pants that didn't fit me, now they're falling off my hips.
[02:20:13.460 --> 02:20:16.460]  There's been a noticeable increase in energy.
[02:20:16.460 --> 02:20:17.460]  Then this stuff works.
[02:20:17.460 --> 02:20:18.460]  It does work.
[02:20:18.460 --> 02:20:21.460]  That's what Bill said after taking Andro 400 for a month.
[02:20:21.460 --> 02:20:24.460]  Now listen to what Richard says about Andro 400.
[02:20:24.460 --> 02:20:29.460]  I did a lot of research on it before I ordered it because I've tried other products in the
[02:20:29.460 --> 02:20:33.460]  past and they haven't worked, but I could not believe the difference literally within
[02:20:33.460 --> 02:20:34.460]  a month.
[02:20:34.460 --> 02:20:36.460]  Since I started taking it, I have lost 37 pounds.
[02:20:36.460 --> 02:20:37.460]  It was the belly fat.
[02:20:37.460 --> 02:20:40.460]  I could get weight off, but I could never get the tummy off.
[02:20:40.460 --> 02:20:44.460]  Now the tummy's coming off and I have more energy than I've had in 20 years.
[02:20:44.460 --> 02:20:49.460]  Guys, if you too want to lose belly fat, gain energy and feel 20 years younger like Richard.
[02:20:49.460 --> 02:20:51.460]  Try Andro 400.

[02:36:00.460 --> 02:36:26.460]  That's 888-965-2140.
[02:36:26.460 --> 02:36:52.460]  That's 888-965-2140.
[02:36:52.460 --> 02:37:18.460]  That's 888-965-2140.
[02:37:18.460 --> 02:37:46.460]  That's 888-965-2140.
[02:37:46.460 --> 02:38:14.460]  That's 888-965-2140.
[02:38:14.460 --> 02:38:42.460]  That's 888-965-2140.
[02:38:42.460 --> 02:39:10.460]  That's 888-965-2140.
[02:39:10.460 --> 02:39:38.460]  That's 888-965-2140.
[02:39:38.460 --> 02:39:40.460]  Yeah, but forget Soros.
[02:39:40.460 --> 02:39:46.460]  You keep worrying about a man who's not relevant to anything except in South and to the Nazis.
[02:39:46.460 --> 02:39:54.460]  The real issue here is that we have a strategic focus where no one has talked about the fact.
[02:39:54.460 --> 02:39:58.460]  We have 450 military bases around China.
[02:39:58.460 --> 02:40:01.460]  China is now in a noose.
[02:40:01.460 --> 02:40:10.460]  We can tighten the noose and make China really hurt because this is not just a situation where it's economic embargo to North Korea.
[02:40:10.460 --> 02:40:15.460]  This is in a situation where China knows it's surrounded by our military forces.
[02:40:15.460 --> 02:40:21.460]  That Twitter account was really directed to President Xi Jinping.
[02:40:21.460 --> 02:40:25.460]  He knew that and so did our generals understand.
[02:40:25.460 --> 02:40:33.460]  As you're saying, Trump did work out this strategy and that he's not being a wild card with a statement about fire and fury and power.
[02:40:33.460 --> 02:40:34.460]  Correct.
[02:40:34.460 --> 02:40:44.460]  If you look at the art of the deal, you will see that Trump always looks to another person in order to look to A, but he wants pressure on B.
[02:40:44.460 --> 02:40:46.460]  So he's very clever.
[02:40:46.460 --> 02:40:50.460]  Putin has said it repeatedly and those who work with Trump say it repeatedly.
[02:40:50.460 --> 02:40:55.460]  I have never met him personally, but I know his modus operandi.
[02:40:55.460 --> 02:40:57.460]  I see exactly how it works.
[02:40:57.460 --> 02:40:58.460]  I understand how it works.
[02:40:58.460 --> 02:41:01.460]  So here's the next question and I got to go to phone calls because they want to talk to you and Adam.
[02:41:01.460 --> 02:41:04.460]  And I'm going to skip this next break because we have more time here.
[02:41:04.460 --> 02:41:06.460]  But you did call.
[02:41:06.460 --> 02:41:11.460]  In fact, it gives me a headache trying to call the times you did a couple of years ago, a few months ago, a few weeks ago.
[02:41:11.460 --> 02:41:13.460]  You were like, Alex, don't worry about North Korea.
[02:41:13.460 --> 02:41:18.460]  It's all about the saber rattling, you know, as a pretext for the forces to be there in circling China.
[02:41:18.460 --> 02:41:21.460]  And if they keep going, we're going to have India destabilize them.
[02:41:21.460 --> 02:41:22.460]  That's what this deal is about.
[02:41:22.460 --> 02:41:24.460]  Well, clearly that's what's happened.
[02:41:24.460 --> 02:41:25.460]  So what comes next?
[02:41:25.460 --> 02:41:26.460]  What do you expect China to do?
[02:41:26.460 --> 02:41:27.460]  Well, here's a question I have.
[02:41:27.460 --> 02:41:31.460]  So I know that Uncle Don can't even get an op-ed in the New York Times anymore.
[02:41:31.460 --> 02:41:35.460]  He used to, you know, if he wrote something, they'd be like, we'll take it almost sight unseen.
[02:41:35.460 --> 02:41:40.460]  He finally wound up recently with kind of like an interview in Newsweek of all things.
[02:41:40.460 --> 02:41:42.460]  Like that's not really that relevant anymore.
[02:41:42.460 --> 02:41:44.460]  And he's right off the top.
[02:41:44.460 --> 02:41:46.460]  He says North Korea is not suicidal.
[02:41:46.460 --> 02:41:48.460]  They're not going to attack us.
[02:41:48.460 --> 02:41:50.460]  They just want to be seen as a player.
[02:41:50.460 --> 02:41:54.460]  They just want, you know, real truths, not armistice and all this crap.
[02:41:54.460 --> 02:41:59.460]  But why is it, in your opinion, this being, you know, the information wars,
[02:41:59.460 --> 02:42:03.460]  why does the New York Times not see this simple fact?
[02:42:03.460 --> 02:42:06.460]  We were just, before you came on, we were talking about look at China, look at India,
[02:42:06.460 --> 02:42:09.460]  not done the brink of nuclear war.
[02:42:09.460 --> 02:42:12.460]  Why is this because they're instructed to do so?
[02:42:12.460 --> 02:42:13.460]  Or are they just stupid?
[02:42:13.460 --> 02:42:14.460]  No.
[02:42:14.460 --> 02:42:18.460]  Adam, it gets to a very basic point that you just pointed out.
[02:42:18.460 --> 02:42:20.460]  They're not Don Greggs.
[02:42:20.460 --> 02:42:25.460]  They're not any of the guys who were trained in national security and intelligence.
[02:42:25.460 --> 02:42:28.460]  The New York Times is stupid.
[02:42:28.460 --> 02:42:30.460]  I mean, as simple as that.
[02:42:30.460 --> 02:42:32.460]  Aren't they worried just about trying to stay relevant
[02:42:32.460 --> 02:42:35.460]  and attacking any independent media they don't control?
[02:42:35.460 --> 02:42:36.460]  Well, they run on sources.
[02:42:36.460 --> 02:42:38.460]  They run on sources and whatever their sources are.
[02:42:38.460 --> 02:42:39.460]  They print.
[02:42:39.460 --> 02:42:40.460]  Yeah.
[02:42:40.460 --> 02:42:41.460]  And you know that, Adam.
[02:42:41.460 --> 02:42:45.460]  If Don wanted to manipulate a source or I wanted to manipulate a source,
[02:42:45.460 --> 02:42:47.460]  it's easy in the New York Times.
[02:42:47.460 --> 02:42:49.460]  The day of the source is over.
[02:42:49.460 --> 02:42:51.460]  The day of the Twitter has come about.
[02:42:51.460 --> 02:42:53.460]  New York Times is not relevant.
[02:42:53.460 --> 02:42:56.460]  You have millions of dollars that's going down the drain in the New York Times,
[02:42:56.460 --> 02:42:57.460]  the Washington Post.
[02:42:57.460 --> 02:42:58.460]  So let's talk about Twitter.
[02:42:58.460 --> 02:42:59.460]  You come on.
[02:42:59.460 --> 02:43:01.460]  You get thousands of tweets bullying you.
[02:43:01.460 --> 02:43:02.460]  What are you doing?
[02:43:02.460 --> 02:43:03.460]  Don't go on Alex Jones.
[02:43:03.460 --> 02:43:04.460]  We're going to not like you.
[02:43:04.460 --> 02:43:07.460]  And then most of its bots and all they do is try to bully,
[02:43:07.460 --> 02:43:12.460]  like they're stopping info wars or like they're stopping you when you're relevant,
[02:43:12.460 --> 02:43:14.460]  not being right wing, not being left wing, Adam Curry,
[02:43:14.460 --> 02:43:17.460]  but just on having a real discussion.
[02:43:17.460 --> 02:43:18.460]  I mean, this is not right wing.
[02:43:18.460 --> 02:43:19.460]  It's not left wing.
[02:43:19.460 --> 02:43:23.460]  Well, the twofold one is all people have bias.
[02:43:23.460 --> 02:43:24.460]  And as we talked earlier,
[02:43:24.460 --> 02:43:30.460]  I think that people have actual forms of brain damage after the loss of Democratic Party
[02:43:30.460 --> 02:43:31.460]  and Hillary Clinton.
[02:43:31.460 --> 02:43:32.460]  It was such a shock.
[02:43:32.460 --> 02:43:33.460]  It was a actual shock.
[02:43:33.460 --> 02:43:34.460]  PTSD.
[02:43:34.460 --> 02:43:39.460]  I mean, up until, you know, midnight, it's like 95% she's going to win.
[02:43:39.460 --> 02:43:40.460]  That's a shock.
[02:43:40.460 --> 02:43:42.460]  If you think you're going to win the Academy Award and you don't,
[02:43:42.460 --> 02:43:46.460]  especially when there's snowflakes and they've invested their whole identity,
[02:43:46.460 --> 02:43:50.460]  like Soran into the ring, into Hillary, the ring gets thrown into the,
[02:43:50.460 --> 02:43:51.460]  into the lava pit.
[02:43:51.460 --> 02:43:54.460]  Well, that doesn't matter that much to me because, you know,
[02:43:54.460 --> 02:43:56.460]  people support whoever they want to support,
[02:43:56.460 --> 02:44:01.460]  but the media so mistreated the information that shock came.
[02:44:01.460 --> 02:44:04.460]  So now people will just see, oh, info wars.
[02:44:04.460 --> 02:44:05.460]  Hey, it must be, oh, he's crazy.
[02:44:05.460 --> 02:44:06.460]  He must be nuts.
[02:44:06.460 --> 02:44:07.460]  Oh, oh, propaganda.
[02:44:07.460 --> 02:44:08.460]  What are you doing?
[02:44:08.460 --> 02:44:11.460]  That's what happens when I literally, literally like that.
[02:44:11.460 --> 02:44:13.460]  But you see the quality of guests you have on here.
[02:44:13.460 --> 02:44:15.460]  This is really, this is really fantastic.
[02:44:15.460 --> 02:44:18.460]  But the difference is the mainstream media doesn't want real guests on.
[02:44:18.460 --> 02:44:20.460]  Well, and they just want to have talking heads.
[02:44:20.460 --> 02:44:21.460]  Like we're going to pre interview now.
[02:44:21.460 --> 02:44:23.460]  What are you going to talk about, Pachennik?
[02:44:23.460 --> 02:44:24.460]  What are you going to talk about?
[02:44:24.460 --> 02:44:26.460]  I want to know first or I'm not letting you on.
[02:44:26.460 --> 02:44:28.460]  Well, that's what we even talked before you came on.
[02:44:28.460 --> 02:44:29.460]  No, sir.
[02:44:29.460 --> 02:44:30.460]  Just walk in.
[02:44:30.460 --> 02:44:31.460]  There you go.
[02:44:31.460 --> 02:44:32.460]  Yeah.
[02:44:32.460 --> 02:44:34.460]  But you see one of the reasons why come on guys,
[02:44:34.460 --> 02:44:39.460]  it's because we all have a sense of humor and a sense of proportion about ourselves.
[02:44:39.460 --> 02:44:44.460]  The reason I adored your uncle and some of his colleagues was the fact he would always
[02:44:44.460 --> 02:44:46.460]  kid about himself.
[02:44:46.460 --> 02:44:51.460]  And, you know, if I was down in the garage, he'd say to me, did you check underneath
[02:44:51.460 --> 02:44:55.460]  your car, which was another way of saying, oh, maybe somebody put a bomb there.
[02:44:55.460 --> 02:44:59.460]  I mean, he had a great sense of humor.
[02:44:59.460 --> 02:45:02.460]  Even when he reprimanded me and it had to do with Panama and all.
[02:45:02.460 --> 02:45:04.460]  I said, you're right.
[02:45:04.460 --> 02:45:05.460]  You're absolutely right.
[02:45:05.460 --> 02:45:08.460]  But you see, you know, Felix Rodriguez and all those guys.
[02:45:08.460 --> 02:45:11.460]  Well, I don't want to get into it.
[02:45:11.460 --> 02:45:14.460]  But he's the only one who could call me back.
[02:45:14.460 --> 02:45:16.460]  And he was the only one I listened to.
[02:45:16.460 --> 02:45:20.460]  But you got to understand one thing that Don Greggs of the world and those of us who were
[02:45:20.460 --> 02:45:25.460]  trained in the seventies and sixties and eighties, we were trained by MIT.
[02:45:25.460 --> 02:45:27.460]  We were trained by a national character.
[02:45:27.460 --> 02:45:29.460]  Don Gregg knows national character.
[02:45:29.460 --> 02:45:30.460]  He knows strategy.
[02:45:30.460 --> 02:45:31.460]  He knows tactics.
[02:45:31.460 --> 02:45:34.460]  And I'm not sure we have that anymore in the intelligence.
[02:45:34.460 --> 02:45:37.460]  And he could not get into the White House when Obama was there.
[02:45:37.460 --> 02:45:39.460]  They would not let him.
[02:45:39.460 --> 02:45:45.460]  You got people in suits with swipe cards who actually watch movies and think they're like
[02:45:45.460 --> 02:45:46.460]  secret agents.
[02:45:46.460 --> 02:45:47.460]  I guess.
[02:45:47.460 --> 02:45:49.460]  I mean, he, he, he tried to get a meeting.
[02:45:49.460 --> 02:45:52.460]  He said, look, I, and he actually was Republican.
[02:45:52.460 --> 02:45:56.460]  He voted for Obama twice and he said, you know, I have some standing.
[02:45:56.460 --> 02:45:58.460]  I've been there in the past couple of years.
[02:45:58.460 --> 02:45:59.460]  Here's what we need to do.
[02:45:59.460 --> 02:46:01.460]  They let him in, had some flunky talk to him.
[02:46:01.460 --> 02:46:03.460]  And 30 minutes later, he was out the back door.
[02:46:03.460 --> 02:46:07.460]  Well, again, it's, it's ignorance and arrogance, my friend.
[02:46:07.460 --> 02:46:09.460]  The two elements that defeated Hillary.
[02:46:09.460 --> 02:46:14.460]  And I said that to you, Alex, for a long time was ignorance and arrogance of Hillary.
[02:46:14.460 --> 02:46:17.460]  She had a hundred million dollars of worthless advice.
[02:46:17.460 --> 02:46:20.460]  And there was Trump with Twitter cost him nothing.
[02:46:20.460 --> 02:46:24.460]  Now, how can you explain that other than basic stupidity?
[02:46:24.460 --> 02:46:26.460]  And that's why they're all freaking out.
[02:46:26.460 --> 02:46:28.460]  The other fist realizes it lost.
[02:46:28.460 --> 02:46:33.460]  So now it's got to prove that it, it, it can come back or it's going to be defunded.
[02:46:33.460 --> 02:46:37.460]  So they're all fighting for their lives, but they don't get even if they defeat Trump.
[02:46:37.460 --> 02:46:38.460]  It's Pyrrhic.
[02:46:38.460 --> 02:46:39.460]  They're gone.
[02:46:39.460 --> 02:46:40.460]  They're done.
[02:46:40.460 --> 02:46:43.460]  They, and I'm not just saying give up like propaganda to the globalist.
[02:46:43.460 --> 02:46:44.460]  They're done.
[02:46:44.460 --> 02:46:45.460]  Your system doesn't work.
[02:46:45.460 --> 02:46:46.460]  People are sick of it.
[02:46:46.460 --> 02:46:48.460]  Let's go to Paul and Virginia.
[02:46:48.460 --> 02:46:50.460]  I'm going to go to Alex, Bill, Kevin and Max.
[02:46:50.460 --> 02:46:51.460]  Thanks for holding guys.
[02:46:51.460 --> 02:46:52.460]  Let's go to Paul and Virginia.
[02:46:52.460 --> 02:46:53.460]  You're on the air worldwide, Paul.
[02:46:53.460 --> 02:46:54.460]  Amazing discussion.
[02:46:54.460 --> 02:47:02.460]  I've been listening to it, literally on the edge of my feet as I see it.
[02:47:02.460 --> 02:47:07.460]  And I used to work for Mr. Kissinger himself when I was in the Navy.
[02:47:07.460 --> 02:47:12.460]  I see it very clearly as you have three options, two or more options.
[02:47:12.460 --> 02:47:17.460]  Those two are assassinate them, make a deal with the people, assassinate them and replace
[02:47:17.460 --> 02:47:18.460]  them.
[02:47:18.460 --> 02:47:25.460]  The second one is a preemptive nuclear strike with 40 to 50 tactical weapons and five city
[02:47:25.460 --> 02:47:26.460]  blockbusters.
[02:47:26.460 --> 02:47:36.460]  But that requires deep raids of 600-plus people into the country to secure the nuclear stockpile.
[02:47:36.460 --> 02:47:44.140]  And then you're looking at 300,000, 400,000 troops excursion across the border to surround
[02:47:44.140 --> 02:47:47.460]  the DMZ and cut off all those troops.
[02:47:47.460 --> 02:47:53.260]  If you're going to actually have a military strike, you've got to go ahead and kill everybody
[02:47:53.260 --> 02:47:55.460]  in the DMZ with nuclear weapons.
[02:47:55.460 --> 02:47:59.660]  And I don't want this to happen, but if you're going to hit North Korea, you've got to pretty
[02:47:59.660 --> 02:48:05.660]  much destroy, or what a decapitation if it went that way, Dr. Pachennick, and your view
[02:48:05.660 --> 02:48:06.660]  work.
[02:48:06.660 --> 02:48:10.460]  Well, the issue of decapitation is interesting.
[02:48:10.460 --> 02:48:15.100]  I mean, that's always been what we call a scenario that's been up there.
[02:48:15.100 --> 02:48:20.660]  But one of the reasons why Kim Jong-un is nervous and keeps on pushing the buttons, as
[02:48:20.660 --> 02:48:27.060]  Don Gray understands it very well, is the fact that he's really signaling to us that
[02:48:27.060 --> 02:48:32.900]  if we had a discussion in terms of keeping him in power, he would calm down somewhat.
[02:48:32.900 --> 02:48:36.060]  And that's what the Chinese response is towards.
[02:48:36.060 --> 02:48:41.620]  And in fact, we're saying, look, you can't continue this kind of behavior, one in North
[02:48:41.620 --> 02:48:43.820]  Korea, but more importantly, in China.
[02:48:43.820 --> 02:48:49.700]  We can decapitate them in terms of taking them out tactically, not strategically.
[02:48:49.700 --> 02:48:55.460]  I told you, the borders are too close, DMZ is 30 miles away from Seoul.
[02:48:55.460 --> 02:48:58.260]  Any attack would totally obliterate Seoul.
[02:48:58.260 --> 02:48:59.900]  We're talking about millions of people.
[02:48:59.900 --> 02:49:02.380]  I just don't see it happening at all, at all, at all.
[02:49:02.380 --> 02:49:06.780]  I'm saying if you do it, you have to wipe all those troops out, because they've all
[02:49:06.780 --> 02:49:09.540]  got dead man switches to attack if they don't get orders.
[02:49:09.540 --> 02:49:15.620]  No, what the gentleman, I think, was referring to is a specific assassination.
[02:49:15.620 --> 02:49:18.220]  That's why I brought up decapitation, yeah.
[02:49:18.220 --> 02:49:22.700]  But in reality, it sounds easier than it is.
[02:49:22.700 --> 02:49:26.620]  It's not a complicated process, but I don't want to get into it here.
[02:49:26.620 --> 02:49:31.980]  The truth of the matter is that Kim Jong-un wants to remain as part of the familial heritage
[02:49:31.980 --> 02:49:37.100]  to maintain power, and he will give away a lot in order to remain in power.
[02:49:37.100 --> 02:49:41.580]  But he knows from one thing, and Don Greg always knew this, that if we took away the
[02:49:41.580 --> 02:49:45.700]  atomic bomb from Saddam Hussein or any weapons, then we took him out.
[02:49:45.700 --> 02:49:47.700]  We took out Gaddafi, gave us the weapon.
[02:49:47.700 --> 02:49:51.540]  He knows that if he has weapons and missiles, then he's a player and gets left alone.
[02:49:51.540 --> 02:49:53.140]  Correct, and he gets left alone.
[02:49:53.140 --> 02:49:54.700]  It's his insurance policy.
[02:49:54.700 --> 02:49:55.700]  It doesn't really work.
[02:49:55.700 --> 02:49:59.860]  I mean, the missiles aren't all that great, and he's not going to go to war, but he has
[02:49:59.860 --> 02:50:04.100]  to have some kind of assurance that he will remain in power so that at least-
[02:50:04.100 --> 02:50:10.180]  Exactly, Paul, real quick, getting a decapitation, are you saying you think it's good to decapitate
[02:50:10.180 --> 02:50:11.460]  the North Korean leadership?
[02:50:11.460 --> 02:50:12.620]  Well, no.
[02:50:12.620 --> 02:50:18.100]  You've got to do it with a deal with the North Korean leadership, and I don't think
[02:50:18.100 --> 02:50:21.220]  we know enough people in North Korea.
[02:50:21.220 --> 02:50:27.180]  If you make the deal with the underlings underneath him to kill them, that's the deal.
[02:50:27.180 --> 02:50:28.180]  That's the decapitation.
[02:50:28.180 --> 02:50:29.180]  That's the only way-
[02:50:29.180 --> 02:50:32.060]  Well, the takeover of them, I mean, actually getting people that wanted to work with the
[02:50:32.060 --> 02:50:37.240]  West would be better unless you want to keep selling weapons and using North Korea as a
[02:50:37.240 --> 02:50:38.740]  chess piece.
[02:50:38.740 --> 02:50:39.740]  And this-
[02:50:39.740 --> 02:50:43.300]  I don't know if you heard earlier, but Don was telling me, he said, look, what is going
[02:50:43.300 --> 02:50:49.060]  on in this axis of evil, especially with North Korea, for the longest time is time for a
[02:50:49.060 --> 02:50:53.660]  sales call, got to sell some gear over there to install, to watch China, and to just sell
[02:50:53.660 --> 02:50:55.740]  some $40 billion worth of gear.
[02:50:55.740 --> 02:50:57.300]  It's the military industrial complex.
[02:50:57.300 --> 02:50:58.740]  He said that very clearly to me.
[02:50:58.740 --> 02:51:01.780]  He said, it's all theater.
[02:51:01.780 --> 02:51:07.780]  This to me is just more of the same, and definitely, as you point out, towards China.
[02:51:07.780 --> 02:51:13.700]  And what I think may be happening is, if we can present a deal to Kim Jong-un, which would
[02:51:13.700 --> 02:51:20.780]  be like Hong Kong, reunification in 50 years or 90 years, you'll be the guy that did it.
[02:51:20.780 --> 02:51:24.500]  We'll totally give you all the props and the honors, but you got to get rid of the nuclear
[02:51:24.500 --> 02:51:25.500]  arsenal.
[02:51:25.500 --> 02:51:26.500]  That may be-
[02:51:26.500 --> 02:51:29.660]  You want to be our ambassador to Korea, North Korea.
[02:51:29.660 --> 02:51:30.660]  I mean-
[02:51:30.660 --> 02:51:31.660]  I'm in.
[02:51:31.660 --> 02:51:32.660]  The message is very strong.
[02:51:32.660 --> 02:51:35.380]  I mean, I think Adam has the right idea.
[02:51:35.380 --> 02:51:37.260]  It's not a complicated situation.
[02:51:37.260 --> 02:51:38.380]  But here's the difference then.
[02:51:38.380 --> 02:51:42.740]  What's so threatening about this broadcast or others like it that the media lies about
[02:51:42.740 --> 02:51:43.740]  it?
[02:51:43.740 --> 02:51:47.420]  When all we're doing is having a real discussion about the real players, the real history, the
[02:51:47.420 --> 02:51:52.180]  real facts, because they want a dumbed-down message to have our own ruling elite that
[02:51:52.180 --> 02:51:56.220]  rule over a bunch of idiots in this country, and that's what Info Wars is about, is getting
[02:51:56.220 --> 02:52:01.100]  people behind the curtain to see the real debates that are actually going on.
[02:52:01.100 --> 02:52:02.100]  Paul, anything else?
[02:52:02.100 --> 02:52:09.820]  Yeah, the real option that you have, the only one that's viable, and you'll know when it
[02:52:09.820 --> 02:52:13.580]  happens, is to boycott China.
[02:52:13.580 --> 02:52:18.660]  If you boycott China, within 30 days, the communist government's finished.
[02:52:18.660 --> 02:52:22.220]  Well, it sounds easier than it is.
[02:52:22.220 --> 02:52:27.940]  The reality is we do have economic pressure, but what we are doing, and I can't speak on
[02:52:27.940 --> 02:52:33.060]  behalf of this administration, but it's been done before, and that is the intelligence
[02:52:33.060 --> 02:52:39.620]  community and the military community is running what we call a financial war, same thing we
[02:52:39.620 --> 02:52:40.620]  did with Iran.
[02:52:40.620 --> 02:52:47.260]  They're basically cutting into China's assistance to North Korea, and Paul is correct.
[02:52:47.260 --> 02:52:52.020]  We are running an economic war right now, but we're hitting the specific...
[02:52:52.020 --> 02:52:53.580]  But has China...
[02:52:53.580 --> 02:52:54.580]  Has China...
[02:52:54.580 --> 02:52:58.180]  Well, and thank you, Collard, thank you, Paul, I got other colleagues, but just briefly to
[02:52:58.180 --> 02:52:59.180]  both of you.
[02:52:59.180 --> 02:53:04.500]  Why are the sectors of the elites, Hollywood, the globalist faction, fighting for their
[02:53:04.500 --> 02:53:05.900]  lives against Trump?
[02:53:05.900 --> 02:53:10.580]  When you look at what he's doing, it's like a standard Americana stability, prosperity
[02:53:10.580 --> 02:53:11.580]  black system.
[02:53:11.580 --> 02:53:13.460]  I think I can answer that.
[02:53:13.460 --> 02:53:18.380]  Almost $700 billion a year of our economy is the military industrial complex.
[02:53:18.380 --> 02:53:22.500]  People are slowly starting to figure out, we have 400, 500 bases.
[02:53:22.500 --> 02:53:23.620]  What exactly is all this?
[02:53:23.620 --> 02:53:25.060]  What is all this money going to it?
[02:53:25.060 --> 02:53:29.820]  And I think that it does not behoove any of the existing systems for people to be really
[02:53:29.820 --> 02:53:31.180]  aware of all that.
[02:53:31.180 --> 02:53:32.180]  So it's...
[02:53:32.180 --> 02:53:33.180]  And I believe...
[02:53:33.180 --> 02:53:35.940]  Trump's crime is he wants to be pragmatic and work with Russia.
[02:53:35.940 --> 02:53:37.460]  Well, that's part of his...
[02:53:37.460 --> 02:53:38.460]  That changes the whole...
[02:53:38.460 --> 02:53:43.500]  But he also probably doesn't want to be killing people all the time to extract resources.
[02:53:43.500 --> 02:53:44.500]  I hope.
[02:53:44.500 --> 02:53:45.500]  I hope.
[02:53:45.500 --> 02:53:46.500]  No.
[02:53:46.500 --> 02:53:47.500]  It just seems...
[02:53:47.500 --> 02:53:48.500]  Dr. Bachinic, what is his great crime?
[02:53:48.500 --> 02:53:49.500]  Then we're going to go back to the calls.
[02:53:49.500 --> 02:53:50.500]  I mean, why are they so angry at Trump?
[02:53:50.500 --> 02:53:55.220]  Because it's like... It's not about Trump really, it's what I said a long time ago.
[02:53:55.220 --> 02:53:58.180]  They failed miserably, it's what Adam said.
[02:53:58.180 --> 02:53:59.180]  They had no...
[02:53:59.180 --> 02:54:00.180]  Absolutely no...
[02:54:00.180 --> 02:54:01.180]  So it's projection.
[02:54:01.180 --> 02:54:05.780]  They hate themselves, their mismanagers, their failures, their jokes, and so they hate
[02:54:05.780 --> 02:54:06.780]  winners.
[02:54:06.780 --> 02:54:07.780]  Well...
[02:54:07.780 --> 02:54:08.780]  Well, now they praise...
[02:54:08.780 --> 02:54:10.900]  It's basically a very simple psychology.
[02:54:10.900 --> 02:54:16.300]  They project it out so that we look like the enemies when, in fact, their deficiencies
[02:54:16.300 --> 02:54:22.380]  have compounded immensely even since Hillary has fled, I mean, you still have Maxine Waters,
[02:54:22.380 --> 02:54:27.300]  you have Diane Feinstein, you have all these 80-year-olds, and I'm of junior, and there
[02:54:27.300 --> 02:54:33.340]  they are speaking on behalf of the millennials when, in fact, I have a young homosexual,
[02:54:33.340 --> 02:54:39.380]  naval intelligence officer who could be the next chairman of the DNC, but they refuse
[02:54:39.380 --> 02:54:44.340]  him and put a Hispanic in from Montgomery County who has never done anything.
[02:54:44.340 --> 02:54:47.300]  So the DNC is self-destructive.
[02:54:47.300 --> 02:54:53.060]  What's happening is you're the fly in the ointment that constantly is there and reminding
[02:54:53.060 --> 02:54:58.180]  them of their incompetency, and never forget the fact that you're still around and you
[02:54:58.180 --> 02:55:03.980]  came out of nowhere and you have somebody like Adam or whoever else, that creates envy.
[02:55:03.980 --> 02:55:07.340]  Envy in the system is very disruptive.
[02:55:07.340 --> 02:55:11.140]  That means they have to destroy you and they want to destroy themselves.
[02:55:11.140 --> 02:55:15.260]  The reality is the more they keep hitting you or when they call you to court or when
[02:55:15.260 --> 02:55:17.740]  they did this or that, it doesn't matter.
[02:55:17.740 --> 02:55:20.660]  You become stronger, the community understands you.
[02:55:20.660 --> 02:55:22.220]  And by the way, you're not just boosting me.
[02:55:22.220 --> 02:55:23.220]  This is for everybody.
[02:55:23.220 --> 02:55:24.220]  It's true.
[02:55:24.220 --> 02:55:26.740]  We get stronger, like Nietzsche said when we survived these attacks.
[02:55:26.740 --> 02:55:30.220]  We literally got stronger when they tried to take my kids and destroy me.
[02:55:30.220 --> 02:55:34.180]  We literally get stronger when they do these demonization pieces.
[02:55:34.180 --> 02:55:37.180]  Which other commentator on the left ever said the word Nietzsche?
[02:55:37.180 --> 02:55:39.700]  Would you explain that to me?
[02:55:39.700 --> 02:55:41.540]  I mean, that's my point.
[02:55:41.540 --> 02:55:50.500]  Who can at the same time use Nietzsche, heuristic concepts and make jokes about rock and roll?
[02:55:50.500 --> 02:55:53.020]  Tell me one person other than yourself.
[02:55:53.020 --> 02:55:55.020]  I'm number two.
[02:55:55.020 --> 02:55:58.820]  Well, they all take themselves too serious is what you said at the beginning.
[02:55:58.820 --> 02:55:59.820]  They're not regular people.
[02:55:59.820 --> 02:56:00.820]  Well, that's the point.
[02:56:00.820 --> 02:56:02.060]  But you're unique.
[02:56:02.060 --> 02:56:03.060]  So is the Adam.
[02:56:03.060 --> 02:56:04.060]  So am I.
[02:56:04.060 --> 02:56:07.020]  You know, the Don Greggs of the world understood what I was about.
[02:56:07.020 --> 02:56:11.540]  When I came out of MIT, they immediately came to me and said, let's work together.
[02:56:11.540 --> 02:56:13.040]  There was no if and buts.
[02:56:13.040 --> 02:56:17.500]  They didn't ask me about whether I care about their mothers and fathers as psychiatrists.
[02:56:17.500 --> 02:56:21.300]  What they were interested in, what we were all interested in is what's the strategy?
[02:56:21.300 --> 02:56:22.300]  What's the tactics?
[02:56:22.300 --> 02:56:23.300]  Where do we go next?
[02:56:23.300 --> 02:56:25.300]  And Don Gregg is brilliant.
[02:56:25.300 --> 02:56:26.300]  I mean, it's...
[02:56:26.300 --> 02:56:27.300]  Well, hey, try to get your...
[02:56:27.300 --> 02:56:28.300]  Sort of when you...
[02:56:28.300 --> 02:56:29.540]  Oh, Sean is trying to have your uncle on.
[02:56:29.540 --> 02:56:31.060]  I would love to have him on.
[02:56:31.060 --> 02:56:32.060]  I think he should be.
[02:56:32.060 --> 02:56:33.060]  I would definitely talk to him about it.
[02:56:33.060 --> 02:56:38.300]  But he wrote a book which you might find interesting called Pot Shards, P-O-T, Pot Shards.
[02:56:38.300 --> 02:56:39.300]  And I'll definitely say...
[02:56:39.300 --> 02:56:40.300]  Well, it's interesting.
[02:56:40.300 --> 02:56:41.300]  We got to go to more calls.
[02:56:41.300 --> 02:56:42.300]  Both of you to five more minutes.
[02:56:42.300 --> 02:56:46.140]  That was how I promised I'm going to go to Kevin's up next and others.
[02:56:46.140 --> 02:56:48.820]  But I've got to plug some stuff, speaking of money.
[02:56:48.820 --> 02:56:50.540]  We're funded by the listeners and viewers.
[02:56:50.540 --> 02:56:52.500]  We want to make America and the whole planet great.
[02:56:52.500 --> 02:56:53.500]  We want prosperity.
[02:56:53.500 --> 02:56:56.500]  We want free, real open societies, not Soros's system.
[02:56:56.500 --> 02:56:58.860]  And we're beginning to win, but we're under massive attack.
[02:56:58.860 --> 02:57:05.860]  So, go to infowarstore.com, I've got a whole bunch of huge specials on air purification,
[02:57:05.860 --> 02:57:06.860]  water purification.
[02:57:06.860 --> 02:57:09.340]  It's not because we think we can have nuclear war.
[02:57:09.340 --> 02:57:11.460]  It's because the tap water is full of garbage, folks.
[02:57:11.460 --> 02:57:12.460]  We've got it all there.
[02:57:12.460 --> 02:57:15.620]  The Alexa Pure Probe, massively discounted.
[02:57:15.620 --> 02:57:18.300]  The Alexa Breeze Probe, massively discounted.
[02:57:18.300 --> 02:57:20.900]  Competing units cost $400 to $600 to do the exact same thing.
[02:57:20.900 --> 02:57:24.260]  It's $149 and it runs almost silently.
[02:57:24.260 --> 02:57:25.860]  I've got them all over my house.
[02:57:25.860 --> 02:57:26.860]  You name it.
[02:57:26.860 --> 02:57:27.860]  What is this thing?
[02:57:27.860 --> 02:57:29.500]  It's a four-stage filtration system.
[02:57:29.500 --> 02:57:30.500]  Oh, I see.
[02:57:30.500 --> 02:57:31.500]  Because I have a HEPA filter?
[02:57:31.500 --> 02:57:32.500]  This filters the air.
[02:57:32.500 --> 02:57:33.500]  I need this.
[02:57:33.500 --> 02:57:34.500]  And it's even got the ION system.
[02:57:34.500 --> 02:57:41.060]  And the point is, is that everybody else is putting, like, five times markup when – and
[02:57:41.060 --> 02:57:42.580]  now the patents are out on all this.
[02:57:42.580 --> 02:57:45.300]  They've been around submarines for 50 years.
[02:57:45.300 --> 02:57:47.180]  But now that the patent's up, the price has gone way down.
[02:57:47.180 --> 02:57:48.180]  We solved the lowest price.
[02:57:48.180 --> 02:57:49.180]  Oh, I've got to check it out.
[02:57:49.180 --> 02:57:54.140]  So, it's got a four-stage filter, true HEPA filter, carbon filter, and a pre-filter.
[02:57:54.140 --> 02:57:56.820]  And then it's got an ION cluster in it as well.
[02:57:56.820 --> 02:57:58.300]  It's at $149.
[02:57:58.300 --> 02:57:59.300]  It's insane.
[02:57:59.300 --> 02:58:00.300]  Okay?
[02:58:00.300 --> 02:58:03.940]  I mean, I can tell you right now, no one's even close at $249 what it normally is.
[02:58:03.940 --> 02:58:04.940]  It's insane.
[02:58:04.940 --> 02:58:05.940]  We normally discount at $199.
[02:58:05.940 --> 02:58:13.140]  So, the AlexaPrees, uh-oh, AlexaPereBreeze, infowarstore.com, or triple-A-2-5-3-3-1-3-9,
[02:58:13.140 --> 02:58:16.180]  with all the particular and garbage and things that's out there, yo, it's yourself and your
[02:58:16.180 --> 02:58:17.180]  children.
[02:58:17.180 --> 02:58:21.300]  We have the 1776 specials running in the month of July, but I've got to stop some of these
[02:58:21.300 --> 02:58:24.420]  because the products sell out and they come back in.
[02:58:24.420 --> 02:58:29.700]  It's fluoride-free with iodine and, and, uh, colloidal silver is back in, uh, of the
[02:58:29.700 --> 02:58:30.700]  super blue toothpaste.
[02:58:30.700 --> 02:58:34.100]  We also have the adult type and super blue mouthwash now available.
[02:58:34.100 --> 02:58:37.180]  It's got iodine and colloidal silver in it and is amazing.
[02:58:37.180 --> 02:58:43.700]  infowarstore.com, 33% off right now on the toothpaste, triple-A-2-5-3-3-1-3-9, thanks
[02:58:43.700 --> 02:58:44.700]  for all your support.

[03:00:20.660 --> 03:00:23.460]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, taking your phone calls.
[03:00:23.460 --> 03:00:26.700]  I'm going to stay on the Rogers tunnel to get to all these calls.
[03:00:26.700 --> 03:00:29.500]  The Rogers got big breaking news on Manafort rated.
[03:00:29.500 --> 03:00:33.060]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:33.060 --> 03:00:36.060]  Yeah, I got to cut to the line, they're good, but you are the resistance.
[03:00:36.060 --> 03:00:39.180]  Have you noticed the Democrats have totally adopted the resistance and all that?
[03:00:39.180 --> 03:00:41.460]  Adopt stolen.
[03:00:41.460 --> 03:00:42.460]  Resist we much.
[03:00:42.460 --> 03:00:43.980]  That is the most sincere form of flattering.
[03:00:43.980 --> 03:00:44.980]  True, true.
[03:00:44.980 --> 03:00:45.980]  I love it.
[03:00:45.980 --> 03:00:47.420]  The Sean Hannity show is now the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:47.420 --> 03:00:49.620]  But I don't even want to say that because I want to concede.
[03:00:49.620 --> 03:00:50.940]  That's true victory.
[03:00:50.940 --> 03:00:54.580]  When you're being, it's not plagiarized, it's the truth, it's being magnified.
[03:00:54.580 --> 03:00:57.780]  That means they won't kill me probably because now the transmission has already been sent.
[03:00:57.780 --> 03:00:59.620]  See, I've already done my mission.
[03:00:59.620 --> 03:01:04.500]  Why blow up the missile launcher when the ICBM has already gone into orbit?
[03:01:04.500 --> 03:01:05.500]  They're not going to kill you.
[03:01:05.500 --> 03:01:06.500]  They need you.
[03:01:06.500 --> 03:01:09.260]  You're necessary, necessary in the whole machine.
[03:01:09.260 --> 03:01:10.260]  I don't know about that.
[03:01:10.260 --> 03:01:11.260]  They're really getting pissed off at me.
[03:01:11.260 --> 03:01:12.260]  The leftist.
[03:01:12.260 --> 03:01:13.260]  He's agreeing with me.
[03:01:13.260 --> 03:01:14.260]  I know.
[03:01:14.260 --> 03:01:15.260]  I know Dr. Nose is up.
[03:01:15.260 --> 03:01:16.260]  We'll see.
[03:01:16.260 --> 03:01:17.260]  They're trying to wind up crazy.
[03:01:17.260 --> 03:01:18.260]  He's to kill us all.
[03:01:18.260 --> 03:01:19.260]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:01:19.260 --> 03:01:20.260]  We're necessary.
[03:01:20.260 --> 03:01:21.260]  They keep us around.
[03:01:21.260 --> 03:01:22.260]  It's important.
[03:01:22.260 --> 03:01:23.260]  You need someone to hate.
[03:01:23.260 --> 03:01:24.260]  Oh, you think it's that?
[03:01:24.260 --> 03:01:25.260]  Totally.
[03:01:25.260 --> 03:01:28.340]  You need some kind of opposition that can be marginalized and spat upon.
[03:01:28.340 --> 03:01:29.340]  Exactly.
[03:01:29.340 --> 03:01:30.340]  Kevin.
[03:01:30.340 --> 03:01:32.340]  But they don't get there so hated as they spit on us.
[03:01:32.340 --> 03:01:33.340]  It's like laurels.
[03:01:33.340 --> 03:01:35.100]  It's like the rose petals.
[03:01:35.100 --> 03:01:39.340]  And believe me, this information war stuff, this is what's been going on.
[03:01:39.340 --> 03:01:42.740]  CIA is more in that than any covert killing crap.
[03:01:42.740 --> 03:01:44.660]  It's all about speculation.
[03:01:44.660 --> 03:01:50.380]  It used to be you write something in, you know, like the Kenya Times.
[03:01:50.380 --> 03:01:52.660]  You have an asset right in the Kenya Times.
[03:01:52.660 --> 03:01:56.420]  And then the New York Times goes, according to the Kenyan Times, and right.
[03:01:56.420 --> 03:01:57.420]  Am I right?
[03:01:57.420 --> 03:01:58.420]  Really?
[03:01:58.420 --> 03:01:59.420]  It's just the CIA.
[03:01:59.420 --> 03:02:00.420]  Yeah.
[03:02:00.420 --> 03:02:01.420]  Of course.
[03:02:01.420 --> 03:02:02.420]  That's exactly.
[03:02:02.420 --> 03:02:04.300]  You see what happened is you blew apart the entire system.
[03:02:04.300 --> 03:02:06.740]  And that was part of what I said in the Internet.
[03:02:06.740 --> 03:02:10.940]  And of course, who brought the Internet in with all due respect, it was people like down
[03:02:10.940 --> 03:02:16.580]  Greg, the CIA and DARPA that brought it in in the 1970s and they trained guys like us
[03:02:16.580 --> 03:02:17.580]  at MIT.
[03:02:17.580 --> 03:02:20.220]  But there's some talk that the elite thought it was their total control arm.
[03:02:20.220 --> 03:02:25.620]  But instead, Patriots inside really had it as the ultimate sabotage of the elite.
[03:02:25.620 --> 03:02:29.460]  But I think it's a machine we're building, the people built together using it that the
[03:02:29.460 --> 03:02:30.460]  elites are fighting over.
[03:02:30.460 --> 03:02:31.820]  You think that's an accurate statement?
[03:02:31.820 --> 03:02:37.340]  Well, you got to understand in our world or my world, the elite is down Greg.
[03:02:37.340 --> 03:02:39.140]  It's not the New York Times.
[03:02:39.140 --> 03:02:43.140]  The elite are the people who worked with Don Greg and others and I'm not going to mention
[03:02:43.140 --> 03:02:44.140]  them.
[03:02:44.140 --> 03:02:46.580]  But that is the elite that was the elite.
[03:02:46.580 --> 03:02:48.820]  They were part of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[03:02:48.820 --> 03:02:50.860]  Some of us left as I did.
[03:02:50.860 --> 03:02:55.380]  Some remain, but the real elite has never been part of the New York Times or the Washington
[03:02:55.380 --> 03:02:56.380]  Post.
[03:02:56.380 --> 03:03:01.620]  Adam can tell you, when did David Ignatius of the Washington Post ever call up Don Greg
[03:03:01.620 --> 03:03:02.940]  for information recently?
[03:03:02.940 --> 03:03:03.940]  Never.
[03:03:03.940 --> 03:03:04.940]  Never.
[03:03:04.940 --> 03:03:06.100]  Because they don't want truth.
[03:03:06.100 --> 03:03:09.660]  They want to regurgitate what some think tanker elitist wanted.
[03:03:09.660 --> 03:03:10.660]  Let's Kevin.
[03:03:10.660 --> 03:03:15.620]  Well, they're basically much more sick of things than that and they're opportunists.
[03:03:15.620 --> 03:03:21.340]  And the problem is, if Don Greg is not relevant today, which he is to me, the other elite,
[03:03:21.340 --> 03:03:27.260]  the more important elite in terms of intelligence and military, then he is to the ongoing discussions
[03:03:27.260 --> 03:03:29.700]  and they don't call a Don Greg anymore.
[03:03:29.700 --> 03:03:32.220]  But I would always say to ask, well, where's Don Greg?
[03:03:32.220 --> 03:03:33.220]  What does he think?
[03:03:33.220 --> 03:03:34.220]  Sure.
[03:03:34.220 --> 03:03:36.300]  The point is they don't want to know what North Korea really is.
[03:03:36.300 --> 03:03:37.620]  They just want to make something up.
[03:03:37.620 --> 03:03:41.460]  Well, if they put that out, it becomes more of a fantasy land and becomes dangerous.
[03:03:41.460 --> 03:03:45.660]  If it bleeds, it leads, it's much better for ratings and that is the bottom line.
[03:03:45.660 --> 03:03:48.540]  The bottom line, it is much better for ratings to scare people.
[03:03:48.540 --> 03:03:49.540]  Well, I'll admit it too.
[03:03:49.540 --> 03:03:51.660]  I mean, when they're talking about New King and the President's saying, fire and fury,
[03:03:51.660 --> 03:03:53.660]  I'm going to come around and around and stay around the house.
[03:03:53.660 --> 03:03:57.620]  I mean, you know, like a chicken, you know, I mean, that's what happened.
[03:03:57.620 --> 03:03:58.620]  We love you for that.
[03:03:58.620 --> 03:03:59.620]  You guys are worse than I am.
[03:03:59.620 --> 03:04:02.620]  For 25 years, I've been bowing babies and cows.
[03:04:02.620 --> 03:04:03.620]  Yeah.
[03:04:03.620 --> 03:04:04.620]  And you were right.
[03:04:04.620 --> 03:04:06.620]  That's the crazy part.
[03:04:06.620 --> 03:04:07.620]  It's sad.
[03:04:07.620 --> 03:04:09.260]  It was like in the BBC 20 years ago.
[03:04:09.260 --> 03:04:13.740]  For at least 20 years, they've had humans chest dating and embryonic form inside bovine.
[03:04:13.740 --> 03:04:15.860]  And then I've been, I'm reading it.
[03:04:15.860 --> 03:04:19.820]  I mean, yeah, yeah, you know, but I wasn't a trailblazer.
[03:04:19.820 --> 03:04:20.820]  They were doing it.
[03:04:20.820 --> 03:04:21.820]  Mm hmm.
[03:04:21.820 --> 03:04:22.820]  You were.
[03:04:22.820 --> 03:04:23.820]  Gay frogs.
[03:04:23.820 --> 03:04:24.820]  Yes.
[03:04:24.820 --> 03:04:25.820]  Gay frogs.
[03:04:25.820 --> 03:04:26.820]  The WB frog.
[03:04:26.820 --> 03:04:27.820]  Yeah.
[03:04:27.820 --> 03:04:28.820]  Well, that's atrazine.
[03:04:28.820 --> 03:04:29.820]  Atrazine is a real issue.
[03:04:29.820 --> 03:04:30.820]  It's not being discussed at all.
[03:04:30.820 --> 03:04:31.820]  He's just laughing.
[03:04:31.820 --> 03:04:35.020]  He's like, I can't believe I'm alive.
[03:04:35.020 --> 03:04:38.100]  What's funny is actually you hit on a soft spot right now.
[03:04:38.100 --> 03:04:42.060]  There's this whole new genetic editing called crystal where they can create anything they
[03:04:42.060 --> 03:04:43.060]  want.
[03:04:43.060 --> 03:04:46.460]  So in effect, you know, we're all in the same boat.
[03:04:46.460 --> 03:04:51.020]  Unicorns didn't exist, but we could, we could engineer a baby now with a big pink unicorn
[03:04:51.020 --> 03:04:52.020]  horn.
[03:04:52.020 --> 03:04:53.020]  Yeah, you got it.
[03:04:53.020 --> 03:04:54.700]  You could probably even engineer them to crap skittles.
[03:04:54.700 --> 03:05:02.100]  Hey, Dr. Steve Pachennick, hey, we're going to come right back with Roger Stone, Adam
[03:05:02.100 --> 03:05:03.100]  Curry.
[03:05:03.100 --> 03:05:04.100]  Amazing.
[03:05:04.100 --> 03:05:05.100]  Thank you so much.
[03:05:05.100 --> 03:05:06.100]  Thank you very much.
[03:05:06.100 --> 03:05:07.100]  Nice to meet you, Steve.
[03:05:07.100 --> 03:05:11.020]  What exactly is political correctness and why is it being pushed on the American public?
[03:05:11.020 --> 03:05:15.420]  Well, political correctness is simply a form of psychological manipulation the government
[03:05:15.420 --> 03:05:17.260]  uses to control public opinion.
[03:05:17.260 --> 03:05:21.340]  By controlling your opinions, the establishment gets you to not only agree with their agenda,
[03:05:21.340 --> 03:05:25.820]  but to also ensure that your government created viewpoint also influences others in ripple
[03:05:25.820 --> 03:05:26.820]  effect.
[03:05:26.820 --> 03:05:28.860]  This is how the power elite and the government stay in power.
[03:05:28.860 --> 03:05:32.940]  They use psychological manipulation to turn the public into obedient sheeple, and over
[03:05:32.940 --> 03:05:36.460]  time we lose our ability to distinguish reality from deception.
[03:05:36.460 --> 03:05:39.700]  So how does political correctness and other deliberate deceptions work?
[03:05:39.700 --> 03:05:43.540]  Well, first, the establishment saturates mass media with their agenda they're trying
[03:05:43.540 --> 03:05:48.540]  to push until it invades every aspect of popular culture and is accepted as truth, such as
[03:05:48.540 --> 03:05:50.060]  global warming, for example.
[03:05:50.060 --> 03:05:54.580]  Then the establishment suppresses any counterarguments through their agenda by calling critics kooky,
[03:05:54.580 --> 03:05:58.780]  nut jobs, racists, or, in the case of man-made climate change, climate deniers.
[03:05:58.780 --> 03:06:03.900]  You can learn more about this tyranny over the minds of men at infowarze.com, PrismPlanet.tv,
[03:06:03.900 --> 03:06:05.740]  and our YouTube channel, Resistance News.
[03:06:05.740 --> 03:06:08.380]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[03:06:08.380 --> 03:06:12.220]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[03:06:12.220 --> 03:06:17.100]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance
[03:06:17.100 --> 03:06:19.980]  to organize and prepare a defense.
[03:06:19.980 --> 03:06:26.180]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums
[03:06:26.180 --> 03:06:28.700]  of their own, air raid sirens.
[03:06:28.700 --> 03:06:32.940]  But in the 21st century, there were silent weapons for quiet war.
[03:06:32.940 --> 03:06:37.460]  The pathogens added to the food and water, and to the lining of plastics that destroy
[03:06:37.460 --> 03:06:42.700]  our vitality, turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[03:06:42.700 --> 03:06:46.100]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[03:06:46.100 --> 03:06:54.140]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation
[03:06:54.140 --> 03:06:57.460]  to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[03:06:57.460 --> 03:07:00.340]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today.
[03:07:00.340 --> 03:07:05.220]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands, and it starts at inforwarslife.com
[03:07:05.220 --> 03:07:07.220]  with Anthroplex.
[03:07:07.220 --> 03:07:10.220]  They use their media to assassinate real news.
[03:07:10.220 --> 03:07:14.420]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[03:07:14.420 --> 03:07:19.060]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their
[03:07:19.060 --> 03:07:21.780]  narrative over and over again.
[03:07:21.780 --> 03:07:27.260]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance, all to make them march, make
[03:07:27.260 --> 03:07:34.060]  them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows,
[03:07:34.060 --> 03:07:39.580]  burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding, until
[03:07:39.580 --> 03:07:45.660]  the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[03:07:45.660 --> 03:07:49.740]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[03:07:49.740 --> 03:07:56.380]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight
[03:07:56.380 --> 03:08:00.860]  this violence of lies with the clenched fist of truth.
[03:08:00.860 --> 03:08:29.100]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm Freedom's Safest Place.
[03:08:30.860 --> 03:08:58.580]  Between the time of the fall of the witch Queen Hillary and the rise of the anti-globalist
[03:08:58.580 --> 03:09:07.980]  movement, there was a time of great adventure, I alone am your chronicler, I'm cutting one
[03:09:07.980 --> 03:09:13.340]  for David Knight, it's kind of a comedy piece but fun for his new show, he's launching,
[03:09:13.340 --> 03:09:19.660]  where it starts like that, between the time of the fall of Hillary, no, no, I was writing
[03:09:19.660 --> 03:09:24.060]  it yesterday, I've been a voice today, it was more like between the defeat of the witch
[03:09:24.060 --> 03:09:30.740]  Queen Hillary and the fall of the New World Order, there was a time of great adventure,
[03:09:30.740 --> 03:09:36.900]  and then it comes in with the big anvil of crom music you just heard, kind of a side
[03:09:36.900 --> 03:09:44.060]  issue but that is coming up, what's the launch date of David Knight's new broadcast?
[03:09:44.060 --> 03:09:52.740]  It's the 21st, August 21st, 2017, real news with David Knight, and folks are saying, are
[03:09:52.740 --> 03:09:54.580]  you still going to call it real news?
[03:09:54.580 --> 03:09:58.340]  President Trump's launched his new thing called real news, yes the two don't compete
[03:09:58.340 --> 03:10:04.620]  with each other, one is an hourly boil down, ours is a week morning, three hour transmission
[03:10:04.620 --> 03:10:09.740]  of talk radio, and we launched it first, is the president plagiarizing us?
[03:10:09.740 --> 03:10:17.300]  No, if the CNN is fake news, we're launching something called the real news, and I know
[03:10:17.300 --> 03:10:22.300]  that most of our audience understands that but some people territorialize things a little
[03:10:22.300 --> 03:10:29.020]  too much, and I get territorialism with women and things like that, but I do not get territorialism
[03:10:29.020 --> 03:10:36.220]  when it comes to ideas, I want my ideas taken when it's by the patriots, I don't like the
[03:10:36.220 --> 03:10:40.500]  plagiarism of the left, and Roger Stone has had CNN all the rest of them take what he
[03:10:40.500 --> 03:10:46.740]  says and invert it, we have had him call themselves the resistance now everywhere, we've got so
[03:10:46.740 --> 03:10:51.780]  much to cover Manafort, SWAT team rated, the North Korea situation, and then he's got a
[03:10:51.780 --> 03:10:55.700]  guest coming up, but I promise that's why I stayed over in his time, we're gonna go
[03:10:55.700 --> 03:11:00.180]  to Kevin and Max and Bill and Josh and Alex in about two minutes, but Roger Stone tells
[03:11:00.180 --> 03:11:06.340]  what's coming up, and speaking of people stealing information, that's what MSM's done
[03:11:06.340 --> 03:11:11.660]  to us in their desperateness, but it's not working.
[03:11:11.660 --> 03:11:16.820]  Alex in the second half hour, we're gonna analyze the president's decision yesterday
[03:11:16.820 --> 03:11:26.540]  to endorse Senator Luther Strange in the special election in Alabama for the seat of Jeff Sessions.
[03:11:26.540 --> 03:11:31.980]  The reason this is important is because the president has unfortunately folded to pressure
[03:11:31.980 --> 03:11:38.620]  from Mitch McConnell and is supporting a candidate who does not support the Trump agenda.
[03:11:38.620 --> 03:11:44.460]  I view this as a golden opportunity to demonstrate that the president's prepared to punish his
[03:11:44.460 --> 03:11:51.860]  Republican opponents, but unfortunately General Kelly and others have got the president to
[03:11:51.860 --> 03:11:56.740]  go along to get along, we'll get into this in the second half hour.
[03:11:56.740 --> 03:12:02.420]  The big news today of course is the Manafort raid, I have now conferred with Manafort's
[03:12:02.420 --> 03:12:09.580]  attorneys, I have confirmed that all of the records that were obtained were never requested
[03:12:09.580 --> 03:12:16.820]  by Mueller's office, they were all mundane, mostly public documents, bank records could
[03:12:16.820 --> 03:12:22.860]  certainly have been obtained by Mueller from the bank with a subpoena.
[03:12:22.860 --> 03:12:29.780]  So this is a kangaroo court style show process, and as I said earlier, I think they're trying
[03:12:29.780 --> 03:12:34.940]  to distract from the fact that Jeff Sessions may finally have woken up and appears to be
[03:12:34.940 --> 03:12:41.620]  on the trail of Bill and Hillary Clinton and the corruption at the Clinton Foundation
[03:12:41.620 --> 03:12:48.500]  because attorneys from the Southern District in New York have interviewed a number of Clinton
[03:12:48.500 --> 03:12:54.580]  Foundation officials and are seeking an interview with Hillary herself.
[03:12:54.580 --> 03:12:59.380]  Wow, flesh that out more for us, because obviously you're the former business partner in your
[03:12:59.380 --> 03:13:05.940]  lobbying firm with Manafort, Manafort Stone, Stone and Manafort, and he was the campaign
[03:13:05.940 --> 03:13:12.420]  chairman after Lewandowski took over from you, which I guess he was the third campaign
[03:13:12.420 --> 03:13:19.180]  manager, pure optics, obviously they admit they've run cold on their whole Russian narrative.
[03:13:19.180 --> 03:13:23.060]  You've said many times when you've been subpoenaed by these same people, you've said nothing
[03:13:23.060 --> 03:13:28.820]  because there is nothing, they're talking about in Reuters and places but me being subpoenaed,
[03:13:28.820 --> 03:13:33.340]  I mean there's literally about my Russian funding, I mean it's like saying they're going
[03:13:33.340 --> 03:13:38.580]  to subpoena me about the leprechaun I've got living in my basement, I mean it's just there
[03:13:38.580 --> 03:13:44.980]  is no Russian connection, there's zero, zero, zero.
[03:13:44.980 --> 03:13:52.380]  That's exactly right Alex, look this is really quite simple, Paul Manafort represented a political
[03:13:52.380 --> 03:13:59.340]  party in the Ukraine that competed in an election the results of which we the United States
[03:13:59.340 --> 03:14:02.220]  are recognized.
[03:14:02.220 --> 03:14:10.140]  The individual that he elected, Viktor Yukonovich, then went on to take Ukraine into the European
[03:14:10.140 --> 03:14:15.780]  Union over the opposition of Vladimir Putin.
[03:14:15.780 --> 03:14:24.100]  There's nothing untoward or illegal or improper about Manafort's representation of a political
[03:14:24.100 --> 03:14:31.620]  party in a foreign country, it's perfectly proper in fact it's common.
[03:14:31.620 --> 03:14:38.300]  Some have said well because Yukonovich was a pro-eastern that shows that Manafort is
[03:14:38.300 --> 03:14:42.820]  in bed with the Russians, it shows nothing of the kind.
[03:14:42.820 --> 03:14:45.940]  That's all they've got, you've been saying that for over a year, that's what's come out
[03:14:45.940 --> 03:14:49.500]  but the big problem I've read from this is they're now looking with what you predicted
[03:14:49.500 --> 03:14:53.860]  with total precision, it's just it's just true that next it would be oh banks or money
[03:14:53.860 --> 03:14:58.860]  or campaign money or laundering or not paying all his taxes and now they admit it's a total
[03:14:58.860 --> 03:15:03.500]  dragnet of his friends, his family, the entire Trump organization, any media that supports
[03:15:03.500 --> 03:15:08.380]  him, it's an intimidation not just a witch hunt but the message you back Trump and the
[03:15:08.380 --> 03:15:13.220]  make America great again agenda, we're going to destroy you.
[03:15:13.220 --> 03:15:21.020]  Exactly right, exactly right and we have seen this by Mueller's publicly stated intention
[03:15:21.020 --> 03:15:27.180]  that he's going to look at real estate transactions done by Donald Trump 25 years ago long before
[03:15:27.180 --> 03:15:33.620]  he entered the public arena of politics, Alex they believe or at least they purport
[03:15:33.620 --> 03:15:42.300]  to believe that Russian funded bots have taken the info wars links of some of our best stories
[03:15:42.300 --> 03:15:45.100]  and put them out on the internet.
[03:15:45.100 --> 03:15:51.340]  This is a lie, there is no evidence to this effect, it's merely a way to blacken your
[03:15:51.340 --> 03:15:58.380]  name and try to discredit info wars, there is no there there, I can tell you what Mueller
[03:15:58.380 --> 03:16:01.860]  has got in his hand, nothing, zero.
[03:16:01.860 --> 03:16:05.100]  The Russian thing is the ultimate nothing burger just like global warming and all the
[03:16:05.100 --> 03:16:08.300]  rest of it but are man made anthropogenic but expanding on that to them, I know these
[03:16:08.300 --> 03:16:14.820]  calls, this breaks you get more time, clearly the other strategy is just get this grand jury
[03:16:14.820 --> 03:16:22.900]  that comes out of the swamp, 91% voted for Hillary, clearly it's just shake the voodoo
[03:16:22.900 --> 03:16:28.180]  stick at things and just say oh look they're criminal over and over again and then just
[03:16:28.180 --> 03:16:33.220]  say abracadabra and subpoena and swat team enough people until that materializes but
[03:16:33.220 --> 03:16:35.940]  I just don't see the public buying it.
[03:16:35.940 --> 03:16:43.020]  No it's kind of interesting what you have and it's very noticeable, Brennan, Clapper,
[03:16:43.020 --> 03:16:51.620]  Rogers and all of the deep state talking heads saying over and over again we know the Russians
[03:16:51.620 --> 03:16:56.660]  interfered with the American elections and they colluded with the Trump campaign, they
[03:16:56.660 --> 03:17:05.020]  mindlessly repeated over and over and over and it's a lie and they know it's a lie but
[03:17:05.020 --> 03:17:09.180]  they think if they keep saying it that people will believe it.
[03:17:09.180 --> 03:17:14.900]  The national polls say, even in their fake polls, 6% think Russia's real or important
[03:17:14.900 --> 03:17:19.740]  in New York Times polls, people are sick of it, their own party constituents say fire
[03:17:19.740 --> 03:17:25.380]  Pelosi from leadership, fire waters, we're sick of these losers, we want jobs, well Trump's
[03:17:25.380 --> 03:17:29.500]  giving you, in fact there's a clip Daria was pointing out, my Russian handler, I'm joking
[03:17:29.500 --> 03:17:34.420]  I shouldn't even joke about that, she's the biggest Russian, actually we got here, she
[03:17:34.420 --> 03:17:38.620]  is of evil Russian lineage, she was pointing out a video we ought to air from the news,
[03:17:38.620 --> 03:17:43.100]  I'll dig it out here after calls where, I mean they're pointing out Trump is giving
[03:17:43.100 --> 03:17:49.660]  people classic nationalistic JFK style economic stuff, I mean he's more of an old fashioned
[03:17:49.660 --> 03:17:55.340]  Democrat when it comes to economic policies than he's a Republican.
[03:17:55.340 --> 03:18:03.060]  1 million new jobs since he became president, the stock market hitting record levels, cutting
[03:18:03.060 --> 03:18:09.100]  back the low level regulations that are holding America back, these are the stories you won't
[03:18:09.100 --> 03:18:13.900]  read on the front page of the New York Times or the Washington Post, these are the stories
[03:18:13.900 --> 03:18:21.500]  that won't lead on CBS or CNN, that's the real story, yes he is a John F. Kennedy rising
[03:18:21.500 --> 03:18:28.260]  tide lifts all boats style Democrat with a small D, and the fact that Trump is bringing
[03:18:28.260 --> 03:18:34.820]  us prosperity when they predicted the stock market would crash if he was elected is driving
[03:18:34.820 --> 03:18:37.580]  them insane.
[03:18:37.580 --> 03:18:43.740]  And that really is the thing, I noticed on Monday or on the last Friday Drudge tweeted
[03:18:43.740 --> 03:18:49.340]  the jobs numbers from CNBC, hardly a right wing you know a bastion of propaganda, it
[03:18:49.340 --> 03:18:57.580]  was just the job numbers, and they blocked Trump, Eric Trump is his son, the tweet it
[03:18:57.580 --> 03:19:02.900]  just said this is sensitive, this could violate our terms which has the whole list of racist,
[03:19:02.900 --> 03:19:07.340]  all that crap, if you go read their rules, just a link, it wasn't even Drudge's production,
[03:19:07.340 --> 03:19:11.140]  it was just a Drudge tweet with oh look at the great job numbers and look at the small
[03:19:11.140 --> 03:19:15.940]  business numbers the best in decades and they're like oh you can't see that, these people are
[03:19:15.940 --> 03:19:21.700]  even in communist China they let people tweet out positive stuff about the economy, I mean
[03:19:21.700 --> 03:19:25.460]  this is beyond North Korea.
[03:19:25.460 --> 03:19:30.380]  Censorship is kind of the last vestige of the scoundrels here, they can't argue with
[03:19:30.380 --> 03:19:37.060]  us on the merits, they can't argue with us on the facts, so they try to silence us, this
[03:19:37.060 --> 03:19:45.300]  is why I'm affiliated with the FreeRInternet.org movement to make sure that the internet remains
[03:19:45.300 --> 03:19:52.020]  a true level playing field and that important outlets like InfoWars and Breitbart and The
[03:19:52.020 --> 03:19:58.500]  Daily Caller and others cannot be censored, cannot be blocked, cannot be silenced, we
[03:19:58.500 --> 03:20:05.980]  are not going to be silenced, we will not stand for it, we will take drastic action to defend
[03:20:05.980 --> 03:20:11.900]  our First Amendment rights and our rights to a free press and our rights to a free
[03:20:11.900 --> 03:20:19.180]  association, they are really down to censorship as a tactic because they've lost the war
[03:20:19.180 --> 03:20:20.820]  of ideas and they know that.
[03:20:20.820 --> 03:20:24.340]  And historically that's one of the biggest losing tactics, I mean when you go to the
[03:20:24.340 --> 03:20:28.900]  desperate censorship button and then they have to admit it, now Google employees, Facebook,
[03:20:28.900 --> 03:20:34.220]  Twitter start defecting, start leaking more data, it's hurting them worse, I mean Trump
[03:20:34.220 --> 03:20:40.180]  needs to move against Facebook, Twitter and Google for antitrust, for campaign violations,
[03:20:40.180 --> 03:20:45.100]  for clearly, because anybody has free speech outside campaign law, but when you get directives
[03:20:45.100 --> 03:20:50.220]  from the Democratic Party as WikiLeaks shows and you go out and try to shut down the general
[03:20:50.220 --> 03:20:53.940]  speech, it's racketeering by the very definition of it.
[03:20:53.940 --> 03:21:00.140]  Well, you're right, it would be excellent if the assistant attorney general for antitrust
[03:21:00.140 --> 03:21:06.140]  would take a look at these issues, but unfortunately that position is vacant thanks to Ryan's
[03:21:06.140 --> 03:21:10.820]  previous inability to build a Trump government.
[03:21:10.820 --> 03:21:13.260]  Alex, very seriously, what's happening?
[03:21:13.260 --> 03:21:15.780]  Why doesn't he put the guy that got rid of the fairness doctrine in?
[03:21:15.780 --> 03:21:21.780]  I mean, why doesn't he, you know, grab right now Bruce Fine and boom, you're in that position.
[03:21:21.780 --> 03:21:25.460]  You've already headed up the FCC or Chief Counsel, you move free speech forward, you're
[03:21:25.460 --> 03:21:28.780]  right back where you were, boom.
[03:21:28.780 --> 03:21:33.860]  Because the president is unaware of the fact that there is a vacancy because General Kelly
[03:21:33.860 --> 03:21:36.420]  has not told him there's a vacancy.
[03:21:36.420 --> 03:21:39.860]  Mr. Pribis didn't tell him that there was a vacancy.
[03:21:39.860 --> 03:21:40.860]  The current administration-
[03:21:40.860 --> 03:21:44.620]  Instead there's an Obama snot nose right below operating in that position.
[03:21:44.620 --> 03:21:49.740]  You're right, what's happening today in Washington is the current administration in place is
[03:21:49.740 --> 03:21:53.060]  20% Trump and 80% Obama.
[03:21:53.060 --> 03:21:59.500]  At the second and third levels of government, all decisions, all information, all operations
[03:21:59.500 --> 03:22:02.700]  are controlled by the Obama holdover.
[03:22:02.700 --> 03:22:04.460]  And they're dug in.
[03:22:04.460 --> 03:22:09.260]  The man responsible for this, Reintz Pribis, remember that name.
[03:22:09.260 --> 03:22:11.300]  He is responsible.
[03:22:11.300 --> 03:22:12.620]  Amazing.
[03:22:12.620 --> 03:22:16.980]  I gotta go to these calls, they're so awesome.
[03:22:16.980 --> 03:22:17.980]  Let's do it.
[03:22:17.980 --> 03:22:20.660]  But just briefly, is Kelly gonna survive?
[03:22:20.660 --> 03:22:24.940]  Because this new stuff where he is sending communiques to Soros and then more is even
[03:22:24.940 --> 03:22:28.260]  coming out, not just from your sources, that this is all confirmed, that he's an actual
[03:22:28.260 --> 03:22:29.260]  Soros mole.
[03:22:29.260 --> 03:22:32.540]  I mean, how long did he survive?
[03:22:32.540 --> 03:22:36.740]  Just to be clear, I think you're referring to McMaster rather than Kelly.
[03:22:36.740 --> 03:22:39.340]  Oh, I apologize, McMaster, excuse me.
[03:22:39.340 --> 03:22:44.860]  Yeah, look, McMaster was affiliated with the International Institute for Strategic Studies
[03:22:44.860 --> 03:22:51.660]  funded by the Saudis, the Chinese, and George Soros.
[03:22:51.660 --> 03:22:59.500]  Israeli intelligence sources have confirmed for info wars that McMaster and Soros are in
[03:22:59.500 --> 03:23:02.340]  direct email touch.
[03:23:02.340 --> 03:23:07.980]  This is not surprising because into the White House policy shop, McMasters has brought a
[03:23:07.980 --> 03:23:15.780]  woman named Fiona Hill, she comes directly from the payroll of George Soros, and she's
[03:23:15.780 --> 03:23:18.780]  in charge of Russia policy.
[03:23:18.780 --> 03:23:21.700]  You can't make this stuff up.
[03:23:21.700 --> 03:23:24.500]  It's just extraordinary.
[03:23:24.500 --> 03:23:30.780]  McMaster leaked information to the acting FBI director, Andy McCabe, and has been personally
[03:23:30.780 --> 03:23:34.100]  derisive of the president's family.
[03:23:34.100 --> 03:23:40.300]  McMaster has been trying to oust the loyalist Sebastian Gorka, who supports the president's
[03:23:40.300 --> 03:23:44.420]  non-intervention foreign policy.
[03:23:44.420 --> 03:23:51.460]  McMaster essentially cleared Susan Rice of political SB&I saying there was nothing wrong
[03:23:51.460 --> 03:23:56.420]  with it, and he extended her national security clearance.
[03:23:56.420 --> 03:24:03.140]  So even today, she can receive top-secret information regarding our foreign policy and
[03:24:03.140 --> 03:24:05.740]  lag it to Obama.
[03:24:05.740 --> 03:24:12.300]  It is really extraordinary the way the information regarding McMaster has been.
[03:24:12.300 --> 03:24:15.820]  And you got a shadow White House a mile and a half down the road with Obama admitting
[03:24:15.820 --> 03:24:17.300]  he's got moles dug in.
[03:24:17.300 --> 03:24:18.300]  This is incredible.
[03:24:18.300 --> 03:24:20.140]  Kevin, thank you for holding like a trooper.
[03:24:20.140 --> 03:24:21.300]  You're on the air worldwide.
[03:24:21.300 --> 03:24:22.300]  Go ahead.
[03:24:22.300 --> 03:24:24.500]  Hey guys, how was everybody doing today?
[03:24:24.500 --> 03:24:25.500]  Good.
[03:24:25.500 --> 03:24:26.500]  Thank you.
[03:24:26.500 --> 03:24:27.500]  Good.
[03:24:27.500 --> 03:24:32.060]  North Korea is nothing more than a distraction than what Roger Stern has just laid out.
[03:24:32.060 --> 03:24:37.500]  Remember when Bill Clinton or Monica Lewinsky was testifying about how she got the stain
[03:24:37.500 --> 03:24:41.300]  on her blue dress, and she came out and nobody was there to greet her?
[03:24:41.300 --> 03:24:44.980]  Because he shot cruise missiles at a aspirin factory.
[03:24:44.980 --> 03:24:45.980]  Absolutely.
[03:24:45.980 --> 03:24:48.620]  This is nothing more than a distraction.
[03:24:48.620 --> 03:24:50.900]  That's all it is.
[03:24:50.900 --> 03:24:56.420]  Kim Jong-yam, or whatever his name is, is not going to nuke the United States.
[03:24:56.420 --> 03:24:59.140]  He doesn't have them at all.
[03:24:59.140 --> 03:25:04.300]  Adam Curry was asking about the genesis of the report that he was wondering how that
[03:25:04.300 --> 03:25:05.660]  report came from.
[03:25:05.660 --> 03:25:12.060]  The genesis of that report is the same genesis that incubate babies and incubators, sedoms,
[03:25:12.060 --> 03:25:15.180]  weapons of mass destruction, and Russians hacked the election.
[03:25:15.180 --> 03:25:16.180]  It's fake.
[03:25:16.180 --> 03:25:17.180]  Absolutely.
[03:25:17.180 --> 03:25:18.180]  Great call.
[03:25:18.180 --> 03:25:21.060]  Great point, Kevin, thank you for holding.
[03:25:21.060 --> 03:25:22.780]  Kevin, come on on hold.
[03:25:22.780 --> 03:25:28.860]  I want to send him a free bottle of X2 or a CNN's fake news T-shirt or a Bill Clinton
[03:25:28.860 --> 03:25:29.860]  red shirt, whatever he chooses.
[03:25:29.860 --> 03:25:30.860]  He's been holding too long.
[03:25:30.860 --> 03:25:35.860]  In fact, everybody holding, whether or not you get a T-shirt or a bottle of X2 or whatever
[03:25:35.860 --> 03:25:38.500]  you want, basically from the supplements, appreciate that, Kevin.
[03:25:38.500 --> 03:25:39.500]  I've got to take more calls.
[03:25:39.500 --> 03:25:43.340]  The only problem my show is, I'm not taking enough calls, and it's wrong, and it's insulting
[03:25:43.340 --> 03:25:44.940]  to make you hold for an hour.
[03:25:44.940 --> 03:25:49.620]  I'm going to get better about it, or Nico is going to punch me in the nose, even though
[03:25:49.620 --> 03:25:50.620]  I'm Nico's so nice.
[03:25:50.620 --> 03:25:51.620]  He would never do that.
[03:25:51.620 --> 03:25:55.620]  Roger Stone's going to start using external mics, which he's doing, he's good too.
[03:25:55.620 --> 03:25:56.620]  Let's go ahead now.
[03:25:56.620 --> 03:25:58.180]  Who's been holding the longest here?
[03:25:58.180 --> 03:25:59.180]  Bill in Wisconsin.
[03:25:59.180 --> 03:26:00.180]  You're on the air.
[03:26:00.180 --> 03:26:01.180]  Welcome.
[03:26:01.180 --> 03:26:03.580]  Yeah, right on, Kevin.
[03:26:03.580 --> 03:26:05.740]  You hit the nail on the head.
[03:26:05.740 --> 03:26:12.060]  I'm a grunt that supported hunts from out here in Wisconsin.
[03:26:12.060 --> 03:26:18.620]  I worked hard for him, and I'm sick of hearing about how he is being protected.
[03:26:18.620 --> 03:26:28.060]  He puts all these guys in, McMaster, okay, Christopher Ray, Nikki Haley.
[03:26:28.060 --> 03:26:33.020]  He puts them all in there and then throws up his hands and says, oh, what a mess we
[03:26:33.020 --> 03:26:34.020]  got.
[03:26:34.020 --> 03:26:41.100]  Either he is stupid, or we are being played once again.
[03:26:41.100 --> 03:26:44.940]  I've had long discussions with Roger Stone on this, and I know I'm right.
[03:26:44.940 --> 03:26:49.380]  The elite hate him because he's trying to be the president and wants to do policies
[03:26:49.380 --> 03:26:52.620]  that help America and hurt their globalism.
[03:26:52.620 --> 03:26:55.100]  That said, he literally eats McDonald's for real.
[03:26:55.100 --> 03:26:56.100]  I thought that was a joke.
[03:26:56.100 --> 03:27:00.340]  He eats steaks overcooked with ketchup, which is a sin.
[03:27:00.340 --> 03:27:05.020]  And he literally is 71 years old and doesn't get it fully.
[03:27:05.020 --> 03:27:08.900]  He's a patriot, better than Ronald Reagan, but you don't understand.
[03:27:08.900 --> 03:27:10.820]  He doesn't know the pedigrees of all these people.
[03:27:10.820 --> 03:27:13.740]  I do this 18 hours a day, and I can't keep track of it all.
[03:27:13.740 --> 03:27:14.740]  Roger, is that inaccurate?
[03:27:14.740 --> 03:27:19.020]  You know, Alex, I think he is willfully misled.
[03:27:19.020 --> 03:27:25.620]  As I've said here many times in my 40-year experience with him, when he has all the information,
[03:27:25.620 --> 03:27:28.060]  he almost always makes the right decision.
[03:27:28.060 --> 03:27:29.460]  He's a patriot at heart.
[03:27:29.460 --> 03:27:36.580]  So they show him, for example, Dina Habib Powell's resume, and they say, Mr. President,
[03:27:36.580 --> 03:27:41.300]  he's a good Republican, and she's got extensive foreign policy experience.
[03:27:41.300 --> 03:27:47.900]  They don't mention her associations with Huma Abedin or Condu, and then when it comes up,
[03:27:47.900 --> 03:27:48.900]  he goes, okay, get rid of it.
[03:27:48.900 --> 03:27:50.660]  They go, oh, sir, that'll look weak.
[03:27:50.660 --> 03:27:52.160]  Don't do that.
[03:27:52.160 --> 03:27:55.940]  They're in total rebellion against him, believe me.
[03:27:55.940 --> 03:27:59.020]  And we have the perfect example of this past week.
[03:27:59.020 --> 03:28:04.260]  The president put out a statement in support of McMasters because he was tricked into doing
[03:28:04.260 --> 03:28:06.060]  so.
[03:28:06.060 --> 03:28:10.660]  He went to him and said, Mr. President, some people, never said conservatives, never said
[03:28:10.660 --> 03:28:17.180]  Trump supporters, some people are criticizing McMasters for not being sufficiently pro-Israel.
[03:28:17.180 --> 03:28:22.100]  We'd like to put out a statement in support of him from you saying that he is for Israel.
[03:28:22.100 --> 03:28:24.380]  Read the statement.
[03:28:24.380 --> 03:28:29.580]  No one said, oh, by the way, Mr. President, he also just gave Susan Rice a pass for political
[03:28:29.580 --> 03:28:32.900]  espionage, and he extended her security clearance.
[03:28:32.900 --> 03:28:35.700]  They didn't tell the president of that.
[03:28:35.700 --> 03:28:37.260]  He's not a mind reader.
[03:28:37.260 --> 03:28:39.220]  This isn't the great Karnak.
[03:28:39.220 --> 03:28:44.940]  They give him partial information to trick him into being manipulated.
[03:28:44.940 --> 03:28:45.940]  Bill's the county commissioner.
[03:28:45.940 --> 03:28:46.940]  He's been calling for like 15 years.
[03:28:46.940 --> 03:28:47.940]  I remember.
[03:28:47.940 --> 03:28:48.940]  Great guys.
[03:28:48.940 --> 03:28:49.940]  I mean, a lot of great intel.
[03:28:49.940 --> 03:28:50.940]  He's been a guest on the force.
[03:28:50.940 --> 03:28:51.940]  I respect.
[03:28:51.940 --> 03:28:52.940]  He's run some things before in business too.
[03:28:52.940 --> 03:28:53.940]  I know Bill is.
[03:28:53.940 --> 03:28:56.140]  So I'm not talking down to him here, but let me tell you something.
[03:28:56.140 --> 03:29:01.340]  I got like 80 employees and they're great people, but let me tell you, we've gone through
[03:29:01.340 --> 03:29:02.340]  some problems.
[03:29:02.340 --> 03:29:03.580]  We've gone through management.
[03:29:03.580 --> 03:29:05.300]  We've gone through folks saying they're doing something.
[03:29:05.300 --> 03:29:06.980]  They're not BS in your face.
[03:29:06.980 --> 03:29:10.980]  I'm managing 80 people and I'm, and I got great people and it's hard.
[03:29:10.980 --> 03:29:13.100]  I don't know what it's like managing 4,000.
[03:29:13.100 --> 03:29:16.140]  So I'm telling you, I'm not here apologizing for the president.
[03:29:16.140 --> 03:29:19.940]  I have sat there, gotten him information on the media, have a heyday with this.
[03:29:19.940 --> 03:29:21.540]  He's checked it and acted on it.
[03:29:21.540 --> 03:29:23.020]  That's why they go, oh, he's so unstable.
[03:29:23.020 --> 03:29:25.860]  No, he really does act when he gets good info.
[03:29:25.860 --> 03:29:29.900]  The problem is there's such a bunch of cowards in Washington and scum.
[03:29:29.900 --> 03:29:31.900]  You understand what I'm saying, Bill?
[03:29:31.900 --> 03:29:33.460]  Oh, Alex.
[03:29:33.460 --> 03:29:35.420]  I want one t-shirt.
[03:29:35.420 --> 03:29:39.500]  I've learned for Trump that Ivanka, okay?
[03:29:39.500 --> 03:29:47.220]  I guess he set up, he and Jared set up that trip over there where we saw the dancing Saudis.
[03:29:47.220 --> 03:29:48.860]  No, I know.
[03:29:48.860 --> 03:29:51.380]  Certainly Trump, Trump's 71 years old, man.
[03:29:51.380 --> 03:29:53.100]  Imagine how bad it'd be if we didn't have him.
[03:29:53.100 --> 03:29:54.100]  That's all I'm saying.
[03:29:54.100 --> 03:29:55.100]  Imagine if we had Hillary.
[03:29:55.100 --> 03:29:56.100]  We're going to come right back.
[03:29:56.100 --> 03:30:00.020]  We got Rodgers, yes, coming up too, but I'm going to come, I'm going to come right back.
[03:30:00.020 --> 03:30:01.460]  Alex Joe and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.460 --> 03:30:02.460]  I'm telling you folks.
[03:30:02.460 --> 03:30:03.460]  He's not perfect.
[03:30:03.460 --> 03:30:07.740]  He's not Jesus.
[03:30:07.740 --> 03:30:09.140]  Why is the fungus?
[03:30:09.140 --> 03:30:10.220]  Why is the mold?
[03:30:10.220 --> 03:30:12.060]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[03:30:12.060 --> 03:30:13.060]  What is going on?
[03:30:13.060 --> 03:30:14.060]  What has changed?
[03:30:14.060 --> 03:30:19.020]  Dr. Group, the new product, Myco ZX supports normal fungal and yeast balance proprietary
[03:30:19.020 --> 03:30:21.740]  blend of herbs and enzymes, made with high quality ingredients.
[03:30:21.740 --> 03:30:27.020]  Yeah, fungus is a growing epidemic, and I've been testing this formula and making changes
[03:30:27.020 --> 03:30:29.340]  to this formula for over 10 years.
[03:30:29.340 --> 03:30:30.340]  It's available at mformerstore.com.

[03:30:54.460 --> 03:30:59.660]  I cannot sell something unless it helps somebody, and you can't support an organization that
[03:30:59.660 --> 03:31:00.660]  is fighting harder.
[03:31:00.660 --> 03:31:03.740]  Look at the response we're getting, whoever changed the world together.
[03:31:03.740 --> 03:31:04.740]  You are the Info War.
[03:31:04.740 --> 03:31:07.020]  God bless you all.
[03:31:07.020 --> 03:31:10.980]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, while also
[03:31:10.980 --> 03:31:16.100]  enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[03:31:16.100 --> 03:31:20.180]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[03:31:20.180 --> 03:31:24.500]  Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:31:24.500 --> 03:31:29.820]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[03:31:29.820 --> 03:31:36.220]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% organic coffee at infowarslife.com.
[03:31:36.220 --> 03:31:41.340]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn
[03:31:41.340 --> 03:31:43.460]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[03:31:43.460 --> 03:31:47.740]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections
[03:31:47.740 --> 03:31:50.340]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[03:31:50.340 --> 03:31:54.780]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[03:31:54.780 --> 03:31:58.260]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[03:31:58.260 --> 03:32:03.180]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of
[03:32:03.180 --> 03:32:07.060]  my favorite coffee, available at infowarslife.com.
[03:32:07.060 --> 03:32:11.460]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[03:32:11.460 --> 03:32:16.140]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[03:32:16.140 --> 03:32:17.660]  to detoxify the body.
[03:32:17.660 --> 03:32:22.540]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[03:32:22.540 --> 03:32:27.740]  It's made in the USA, it's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely
[03:32:27.740 --> 03:32:30.820]  associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the infowar.
[03:32:30.820 --> 03:32:33.060]  It is a classical 360-win.
[03:32:33.060 --> 03:32:37.540]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe
[03:32:37.540 --> 03:32:42.380]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[03:32:42.380 --> 03:32:43.380]  get.
[03:32:43.380 --> 03:32:46.420]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this
[03:32:46.420 --> 03:32:51.460]  country and the world that Patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[03:32:51.460 --> 03:32:56.700]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[03:32:56.700 --> 03:32:59.420]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[03:32:59.420 --> 03:33:02.700]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[03:33:02.700 --> 03:33:16.780]  Now it's time to change our bodies with ZShield InfowarsLive.com.
[03:33:16.780 --> 03:33:35.460]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:35.460 --> 03:33:49.700]  I got no friends, they can't be seen with me, and I'm feeling real shot down, but this
[03:33:49.700 --> 03:33:55.700]  isn't the 1970s when MSM could attack you and destroy you.
[03:33:55.700 --> 03:33:59.300]  Now, a large portion of the public knows it's a badge of honor.
[03:33:59.300 --> 03:34:04.820]  They're running out of gas, I'm gonna get out of here in a minute or two, riding a shotgun
[03:34:04.820 --> 03:34:05.820]  with Roger Stone.
[03:34:05.820 --> 03:34:09.020]  He's got a guest coming on as we look at the battle with a heart and soul.
[03:34:09.020 --> 03:34:10.820]  When we fight for stuff with Trump, we get it.
[03:34:10.820 --> 03:34:15.460]  When we back off and say he's not perfect, the globalists win.
[03:34:15.460 --> 03:34:16.660]  They are panicked.
[03:34:16.660 --> 03:34:19.620]  Their reaction to Trump is not Kabuki Theater.
[03:34:19.620 --> 03:34:23.020]  It is as real as it gets.
[03:34:23.020 --> 03:34:25.180]  Does that mean we're getting something perfect here?
[03:34:25.180 --> 03:34:26.180]  Absolutely not.
[03:34:26.180 --> 03:34:30.660]  I have the best intentions of stuff I do and I make mistakes and get the wrong info and
[03:34:30.660 --> 03:34:31.660]  do stuff.
[03:34:31.660 --> 03:34:33.940]  The difference is I have good will.
[03:34:33.940 --> 03:34:36.700]  The globalists have bad will towards you, and it's the same thing with Trump.
[03:34:36.700 --> 03:34:41.820]  He has good will, classic Americana, kind of pigheaded, but aren't a lot of good guys like
[03:34:41.820 --> 03:34:42.820]  that.
[03:34:42.820 --> 03:34:45.900]  They didn't get pushed around their whole lives and turned into somebody else.
[03:34:45.900 --> 03:34:51.220]  They are originally what they were, genetically, culturally, historically.
[03:34:51.220 --> 03:34:55.740]  Roger Stone's taken over, but he mentioned their big attack at censorship.
[03:34:55.740 --> 03:35:00.260]  We've had ad blade with Google, ban us off the ads.
[03:35:00.260 --> 03:35:03.300]  We've been kicked off Google Store.
[03:35:03.300 --> 03:35:07.180]  We just had everything happen to us since Trump won, trying to shut down our funding.
[03:35:07.180 --> 03:35:11.820]  There's a new story on infowars.com by Kit Daniels.
[03:35:11.820 --> 03:35:18.140]  Agency selling sex toy ads and barely legal videos, that's what they're promoting, black
[03:35:18.140 --> 03:35:22.660]  list obscene info wars ads for hate and racism.
[03:35:22.660 --> 03:35:32.060]  They said the potential, the potential.
[03:35:32.060 --> 03:35:34.340]  Good effort to censor free thinking libertarians.
[03:35:34.340 --> 03:35:39.260]  It was a very popular ad platform, California based AJ affiliates.
[03:35:39.260 --> 03:35:43.020]  I had the idea, or Fruget had the idea, we had the idea together to have an affiliate
[03:35:43.020 --> 03:35:49.540]  program with our stations, where we then basically promote ads for their products or their stations
[03:35:49.540 --> 03:35:53.980]  on this system, and we push them on info wars, and it's an affiliate program and builds
[03:35:53.980 --> 03:35:54.980]  and builds and builds.
[03:35:54.980 --> 03:35:58.500]  We've been very successful with other systems like this, and they were all ready to sign
[03:35:58.500 --> 03:36:02.020]  us up, and they said, oh my gosh, we can't, you violate our terms of service.
[03:36:02.020 --> 03:36:03.380]  This is a giant company.
[03:36:03.380 --> 03:36:04.380]  It's discriminatory.
[03:36:04.380 --> 03:36:09.180]  Now, you can have a gay couple going in and wanting their cake baked, and then everybody
[03:36:09.180 --> 03:36:15.060]  jumps on to sue the people for not baking, and I say bake the cake.
[03:36:15.060 --> 03:36:19.460]  But when it's big financial institutions and groups and credit card companies saying, we're
[03:36:19.460 --> 03:36:23.340]  not going to do business, you're not real news, there's no judge, there's no jury, that's
[03:36:23.340 --> 03:36:26.820]  defamatory, that's fraud.
[03:36:26.820 --> 03:36:28.940]  And so I am considering legal action.
[03:36:28.940 --> 03:36:32.260]  I don't want a lawsuit, I don't want to look around for the right lawyers to do it, but
[03:36:32.260 --> 03:36:37.820]  I'm putting these folks on notice right now that I've told people I'm getting ready to
[03:36:37.820 --> 03:36:42.420]  file lawsuits, because this is, we got to do something about this, and I've filed lawsuits
[03:36:42.420 --> 03:36:44.140]  before, and everybody knows that.
[03:36:44.140 --> 03:36:48.340]  I've been successful every time, but it's because we develop real cases.
[03:36:48.340 --> 03:36:50.940]  We don't just throw lawsuits out there.
[03:36:50.940 --> 03:36:54.700]  And we just want them to stop doing what they're doing, and we want others to know, there's
[03:36:54.700 --> 03:36:58.140]  a precedent here, you're not going to discriminate against us.
[03:36:58.140 --> 03:37:04.100]  That advertising agency denied business with info wars due to possibility of obscene, abusive,
[03:37:04.100 --> 03:37:08.900]  violent, bigoted, or hate-oriented content, close quote, despite the fact that the agency
[03:37:08.900 --> 03:37:12.940]  does business with sex shops, barely legal magazines, and clients accused of selling
[03:37:12.940 --> 03:37:13.940]  hate content.
[03:37:13.940 --> 03:37:19.340]  By the way, I've been in Hustler Magazine, not as a photograph spread, but three articles
[03:37:19.340 --> 03:37:23.540]  I've written have been in Hustler, one of them on the cover.
[03:37:23.540 --> 03:37:27.540]  And I don't totally agree with everything going on in Hustler, but at the same time,
[03:37:27.540 --> 03:37:31.140]  it was a place to publish My Controversial Views.
[03:37:31.140 --> 03:37:33.420]  And Larry Flint's a listener.
[03:37:33.420 --> 03:37:34.420]  That's on record.
[03:37:34.420 --> 03:37:39.220]  Now, are they going to ban Hustler now?
[03:37:39.220 --> 03:37:47.220]  Because you choose to opt in to have these ads on your website, so this is all incredible.
[03:37:47.220 --> 03:37:52.020]  California-based AJ Affiliates, a major affiliate marketing firm for websites, said it consulted
[03:37:52.020 --> 03:37:56.140]  with legal team, well, your legal team's a little bit more busy now, about info wars
[03:37:56.140 --> 03:38:00.700]  and decided not to move forward, which suggests the company is picking and choosing clients
[03:38:00.700 --> 03:38:05.100]  based on political affiliations through the false veil of combating, obscene, and hate
[03:38:05.100 --> 03:38:06.100]  given to its clients.
[03:38:06.100 --> 03:38:08.100]  I mean, our ads are very, very tame.
[03:38:08.100 --> 03:38:13.020]  In fact, on a scale of one to ten, zero being the most tame, and ten being out of control,
[03:38:13.020 --> 03:38:17.540]  our ads are like a two, folks, because we're just straight up, oh, here's water filters.
[03:38:17.540 --> 03:38:22.740]  For one thing, CJ Affiliates does business with discount magazines, which sells subscriptions
[03:38:22.740 --> 03:38:27.220]  to Hustlers, barely legal magazine, and Adam and Eve, the shop acclaimed number one source
[03:38:27.220 --> 03:38:38.260]  for adult toys, and it just goes on and on and on here, what they wrote back to us.
[03:38:38.260 --> 03:38:42.860]  In fact, I don't know, we should probably publish their letter to us here about it.
[03:38:42.860 --> 03:38:49.220]  They have Cafe Press, they have everybody else in here, and they selectively enforce
[03:38:49.220 --> 03:38:52.660]  what they want, and it's discriminatory, and they're just trying to put my name
[03:38:52.660 --> 03:38:57.180]  out there, that I'm this evil pariah, I'm this devil, I killed the kids at Sandy Hook,
[03:38:57.180 --> 03:39:00.020]  you know, it's basically what they're saying now, it's all made up in attempt to set the
[03:39:00.020 --> 03:39:01.020]  precedent.
[03:39:01.020 --> 03:39:05.460]  So we need folks to support us and buy the products for info or store.com, because whether
[03:39:05.460 --> 03:39:11.140]  it's Google, or Facebook, or Twitter, or these platforms, more and more we're being isolated
[03:39:11.140 --> 03:39:13.140]  as a message to everybody.
[03:39:13.140 --> 03:39:18.100]  So take advantage of the 1776 specials right now, 55% off on BrainForce, we've never done
[03:39:18.100 --> 03:39:22.500]  that, 55% off on X2, it's an amazing product, and so much more, because we found, we sell,
[03:39:22.500 --> 03:39:26.260]  even more, when we discount even more, so the more you buy from us, the more we can
[03:39:26.260 --> 03:39:27.260]  drop the price.
[03:39:27.260 --> 03:39:31.940]  But I'm trying to expand around here, so please come up to the counter there and get some
[03:39:31.940 --> 03:39:36.220]  great products, and shop with the good guys at infowarstore.com, and you've got my commitment
[03:39:36.220 --> 03:39:41.420]  to never back down, and to get you results, you can talk all day about Trump's results
[03:39:41.420 --> 03:39:46.180]  are amazing, is he perfect, no, but look at what he's done delivering, well we've really
[03:39:46.180 --> 03:39:53.420]  delivered, infowarstore.com or triple eight, two five, three, three one, three nine, and
[03:39:53.420 --> 03:39:56.860]  again, this is a great article by Kit Daniels, who writes like eight articles a day, let's
[03:39:56.860 --> 03:40:01.340]  add screenshots of their letter to us, because that's, that's, I want to add that in there
[03:40:01.340 --> 03:40:05.300]  so people see exactly, I mean the emails, everything from a full correspondence, put
[03:40:05.300 --> 03:40:06.300]  it up there.
[03:40:06.300 --> 03:40:10.420]  Roger, you've got your guests to go to, very important, this is emergency breaking news,
[03:40:10.420 --> 03:40:14.100]  this just illustrates what's happening, just like you're going to have to counter sue,
[03:40:14.100 --> 03:40:18.460]  you're having to raise money, right now because Obama set up a team of lawyers, admits he's
[03:40:18.460 --> 03:40:23.220]  suing you through them, he can clearly be a plaintiff now, it's time to fight, and you're
[03:40:23.220 --> 03:40:30.020]  moving forward with lawyers, I'm looking at who I'm going to sue here, but it's down
[03:40:30.020 --> 03:40:36.820]  to a certain yogurt company that we, I'm going to leave it at that, it's down to these people,
[03:40:36.820 --> 03:40:40.460]  Google a lot of folks, Google I put on notice and they at least put our stuff back at the
[03:40:40.460 --> 03:40:44.060]  top listing, but I mean what do we do about this, we have Google in the internal documents,
[03:40:44.060 --> 03:40:49.500]  hiring companies to censor us, and saying that we lied about Syrian rebels launching
[03:40:49.500 --> 03:40:52.820]  chemical attacks when it was confirmed by our own government, they say that's the fake
[03:40:52.820 --> 03:40:58.260]  news and even use exhibits of why they're being banned, Roger.
[03:40:58.260 --> 03:41:03.820]  Alex ironically, the same day that they told you that they would not do business with you,
[03:41:03.820 --> 03:41:10.220]  they also told me they would not do business with my site, the Stone Cold Truth, this happened
[03:41:10.220 --> 03:41:16.060]  previously, as you know, the company called AdRoll, so if you decide to sue, I'm with
[03:41:16.060 --> 03:41:21.980]  you, it's time to fight back, that's right, I said AdBlade earlier, it's AdRoll, AdRoll,
[03:41:21.980 --> 03:41:27.340]  I apologize to AdBlade, they're one or five folks, AdRoll, AdRoll, I apologize to AdBlade,
[03:41:27.340 --> 03:41:29.620]  go ahead.
[03:41:29.620 --> 03:41:35.060]  This is just outrageous, and you're right, it's selective, it has nothing to do with
[03:41:35.060 --> 03:41:42.140]  our content, there's nothing inappropriate or hateful or obscene about any of our content,
[03:41:42.140 --> 03:41:48.420]  their problem is we tell the truth, their problem is that we expose the conspiracy theories
[03:41:48.420 --> 03:41:55.620]  of the left, I mean, the mainstream media is absolutely right, conspiracy theories are
[03:41:55.620 --> 03:42:02.420]  a big problem today, the problem is that most of them are promulgated by the government
[03:42:02.420 --> 03:42:08.140]  and by the mainstream media, all we do, Alex, is correct the record, all we do is debunk
[03:42:08.140 --> 03:42:14.980]  their conspiracy theories, I'll give you an example, but I'll give you a perfect example,
[03:42:14.980 --> 03:42:20.100]  the Russians colluded with Trump to steal the election, that's a left wing conspiracy
[03:42:20.100 --> 03:42:25.060]  theory, it's nutty, there's no evidence of it, they just keep saying it over and over
[03:42:25.060 --> 03:42:30.380]  again, I feel sorry for these conspiracy theorists, they must be very unhappy people.
[03:42:30.380 --> 03:42:33.740]  Alright, I want you to get to your guess, I just barely plugged in the last three and
[03:42:33.740 --> 03:42:38.700]  a half hours, I need listeners to understand, you want people to fight, we're fighting,
[03:42:38.700 --> 03:42:41.860]  and I know you've been supporting us, but if you just sign up for auto-ship, look at
[03:42:41.860 --> 03:42:46.000]  an additional 10% off on things like the coffee or things like the methylcobalamin secret
[03:42:46.000 --> 03:42:51.660]  12, or things like the brain force, free shipping on $50 or more, if you sign up for
[03:42:51.660 --> 03:42:58.580]  auto-ship and get additional 10% off, that funds the operation, you are the lifeblood,
[03:42:58.580 --> 03:43:04.380]  the children's fluoride-free toothpaste is so good, it's back in, the children's super
[03:43:04.380 --> 03:43:12.220]  blue, we now have the Dr. Jones approved, super, not me, my dad is the doctor, fluoride-free,
[03:43:12.220 --> 03:43:17.220]  super blue mouthwash with iodine, colloidal silver, peppermint, and tea tree oil, the
[03:43:17.220 --> 03:43:21.180]  number one recommended mouthwash by Alex Jones, we also have the 10 to 1 by Emmerich's Essentials,
[03:43:21.180 --> 03:43:23.860]  that's excellent, but it doesn't have the iodine or colloidal silver, but it's excellent
[03:43:23.860 --> 03:43:29.260]  as well, purchase it at infowarstore.com exclusively and help fund our operation.
[03:43:29.260 --> 03:43:36.100]  Now back to Roger Stone of Infowars and StoneCullTruth.com.
[03:43:36.100 --> 03:43:43.540]  Thank you Alex, I think a golden opportunity was lost this week, the Republicans in Congress
[03:43:43.540 --> 03:43:50.020]  have done everything humanly possible to thwart the President's program, and the special
[03:43:50.020 --> 03:43:57.060]  election in Alabama afforded the President an excellent opportunity to send a clear message
[03:43:57.060 --> 03:44:03.700]  to his Republican opponents that he will go to the mat with those who refused to support
[03:44:03.700 --> 03:44:05.940]  the reform agenda.
[03:44:05.940 --> 03:44:14.820]  Unfortunately, shockingly yesterday, the President endorsed the appointed Senator, Luther Strange,
[03:44:14.820 --> 03:44:19.140]  who has the support of Mitch McConnell.
[03:44:19.140 --> 03:44:23.300]  While I have huge respect for the President, perhaps he's unaware of the fact that Luther
[03:44:23.300 --> 03:44:32.420]  Strange, as Attorney General of Alabama, corruptly and unethically held a criminal investigation
[03:44:32.420 --> 03:44:40.780]  over the head of disgraced and outgoing Governor Bentley to obtain his appointment to the Senate.
[03:44:40.780 --> 03:44:45.740]  Perhaps the President is unaware of the fact that Luther Strange wants to keep the Senate's
[03:44:45.740 --> 03:44:52.660]  60% rule that empowers Chuck Schumer and the Democrats to kill the entire conservative
[03:44:52.660 --> 03:44:57.580]  Republican Trump reform agenda.
[03:44:57.580 --> 03:45:04.460]  Perhaps the President is unaware of the fact that Luther Strange took a $50,000 contribution
[03:45:04.460 --> 03:45:12.300]  from a heavy polluter as a reward for sending two letters to the EPA blocking an investigation
[03:45:12.300 --> 03:45:18.740]  of the polluter and preventing them from paying the cleanup costs of pollution of the inner
[03:45:18.740 --> 03:45:22.340]  city areas of Birmingham.
[03:45:22.340 --> 03:45:24.260]  This is really extraordinary.
[03:45:24.260 --> 03:45:28.500]  Luther Strange is no friend of the President.
[03:45:28.500 --> 03:45:34.300]  Also in that race is Congressman Mo Brooks, who does not admit that he was named after
[03:45:34.300 --> 03:45:41.700]  Mo of the Three Stooges, and who is a virulent never-Trumper who not only attacked Trump
[03:45:41.700 --> 03:45:47.820]  before he was the nominee, attacked him while he was the nominee, but also attacked him
[03:45:47.820 --> 03:45:51.300]  only weeks ago in this primary.
[03:45:51.300 --> 03:45:57.620]  The good news is there is a Trump supporter in this race, Dr. Randy Brinson, who joins
[03:45:57.620 --> 03:45:58.620]  me now.
[03:45:58.620 --> 03:46:01.620]  Dr. Brinson, welcome to Infowars.
[03:46:01.620 --> 03:46:03.340]  Well, thank you so much, Roger.
[03:46:03.340 --> 03:46:06.940]  Appreciate this opportunity to be with you.
[03:46:06.940 --> 03:46:12.220]  As you know, I am deeply disappointed in the President's decision or the decision that
[03:46:12.220 --> 03:46:15.980]  was hoisted upon him by Mitch McConnell.
[03:46:15.980 --> 03:46:19.780]  I think he had a golden opportunity to show the Senate Republicans that he's not going
[03:46:19.780 --> 03:46:24.540]  to stand for their obstruction and their undermining his program.
[03:46:24.540 --> 03:46:29.380]  You are the only candidate in this race who was actually for Donald Trump.
[03:46:29.380 --> 03:46:34.980]  I should note that former Supreme Court Justice Roy Moore, who's a good man, is in the race,
[03:46:34.980 --> 03:46:39.060]  but all of the polls show that he cannot win this race.
[03:46:39.060 --> 03:46:43.740]  He will lose the race, as he had all of his previous statewide races.
[03:46:43.740 --> 03:46:50.340]  Once he gets into a runoff, the idea of a runoff between Mo Brooks and Luther Strange
[03:46:50.340 --> 03:46:57.580]  boggles the mind to never-Trumpers who cannot be counted on to support the President.
[03:46:57.580 --> 03:47:04.420]  Why don't you walk through people with people, the scandal regarding Luther Strange, presumably
[03:47:04.420 --> 03:47:09.220]  Attorney General Sessions, and why we are where we are today?
[03:47:09.220 --> 03:47:13.700]  Well, it's a very convoluted path, as you know, Roger.
[03:47:13.700 --> 03:47:20.100]  First of all, Luther Strange has two ethics violations pending with the Ethics Commission
[03:47:20.100 --> 03:47:26.580]  that was filed not by a candidate, but the Secretary of State for campaign finance violations.
[03:47:26.580 --> 03:47:27.580]  So those are pending.
[03:47:27.580 --> 03:47:33.140]  And so what happened was they were supposed to answer on those complaints.
[03:47:33.140 --> 03:47:36.740]  And the Ethics Commission decided to go take a vacation.
[03:47:36.740 --> 03:47:40.740]  One of them went off to Canada, and so they put it off after the election.
[03:47:40.740 --> 03:47:42.620]  That's unheard of.
[03:47:42.620 --> 03:47:43.620]  So we have that pending.
[03:47:43.620 --> 03:47:49.220]  So he could potentially be in the runoff and then be removed or disqualified from the ballot
[03:47:49.220 --> 03:47:51.580]  because of this ethics violation.
[03:47:51.580 --> 03:47:56.700]  Then more serious one, even on top of that, is this with the Superfund.
[03:47:56.700 --> 03:48:04.940]  He basically did the bidding of Drum and Coal, not once but twice, got campaign finance payments
[03:48:04.940 --> 03:48:11.420]  right after that, the tune of $25,000 each, and basically blocked the EPA from cleaning
[03:48:11.420 --> 03:48:15.780]  up the site, of which the State of Alabama already agreed they would go along with the
[03:48:15.780 --> 03:48:16.780]  cleanup.
[03:48:16.780 --> 03:48:21.060]  And the reason he did that is because Drum and Coal and others would have to pay the
[03:48:21.060 --> 03:48:24.100]  fines for the cleanup.
[03:48:24.100 --> 03:48:31.260]  And now we see, on top of that, this recent article now by Adam Zagoren that maps out the
[03:48:31.260 --> 03:48:36.180]  whole connection between Bolsh and Bingham Law Firm, who was another big contributor
[03:48:36.180 --> 03:48:41.020]  to Alabama campaigns and Alabama politics, including Luther Strange.
[03:48:41.020 --> 03:48:44.940]  And I think somehow Center Sessions, even though he's a good man, these people that
[03:48:44.940 --> 03:48:49.540]  he's surrounded that giving money are not good people, and that's the problem.
[03:48:49.540 --> 03:48:53.980]  I think Center Sessions trusted people that aren't to be trusted, and that's the problem.
[03:48:53.980 --> 03:48:57.820]  And many of them have been implicated with connection to Bolsh and Bingham.
[03:48:57.820 --> 03:49:01.980]  And that needs to be investigated, including the U.S. Attorney that's addressing me.
[03:49:01.980 --> 03:49:06.140]  So all these things are just a big wash of corruption, and that's what we need to try
[03:49:06.140 --> 03:49:07.140]  to delve into.
[03:49:07.140 --> 03:49:12.420]  I truly believe that Donald Trump, this president, was probably told that he feared Moe Brooks
[03:49:12.420 --> 03:49:17.140]  might get the nomination, or at least be in the runoff, and he didn't want that to happen.
[03:49:17.140 --> 03:49:21.460]  So that's why he did what he did, but he got only half the information.
[03:49:21.460 --> 03:49:25.180]  He didn't get the whole information that I was running, that the Trump nation is behind
[03:49:25.180 --> 03:49:29.380]  me, and all of his supporters are behind me, and that's the person that's a real reformer
[03:49:29.380 --> 03:49:30.980]  in this election.
[03:49:30.980 --> 03:49:38.260]  Well, you are, of course, a former chairman of the Alabama Christian Coalition, an active
[03:49:38.260 --> 03:49:42.420]  in your church and a Bible-believing evangelical Christian.
[03:49:42.420 --> 03:49:44.460]  You are an early Trump supporter.
[03:49:44.460 --> 03:49:49.900]  You've been endorsed by Citizens for Trump, and for my many critics out there know I have
[03:49:49.900 --> 03:49:52.500]  no financial relationship with Randy Brinson.
[03:49:52.500 --> 03:49:55.460]  No, I am not a consultant to his campaign.
[03:49:55.460 --> 03:49:59.140]  I have only one race, a horse in this race.
[03:49:59.140 --> 03:50:01.340]  Randy Brinson is a friend of mine.
[03:50:01.340 --> 03:50:02.700]  He's a good man.
[03:50:02.700 --> 03:50:03.700]  He supports the president.
[03:50:03.700 --> 03:50:06.420]  And we're digging out all the swamp creatures.
[03:50:06.420 --> 03:50:07.420]  We're digging out the swamp creatures.
[03:50:07.420 --> 03:50:08.620]  I'm sitting there watching.
[03:50:08.620 --> 03:50:12.100]  We're digging out the swamp creatures and trying to get rid of the establishment Republicans.
[03:50:12.100 --> 03:50:13.180]  That's our real revolution.
[03:50:13.180 --> 03:50:14.620]  The Democrats, we're not going to fix them.
[03:50:14.620 --> 03:50:17.460]  They're totally mentally ill, and on another planet.
[03:50:17.460 --> 03:50:19.540]  But the Republican Party is the real fight.
[03:50:19.540 --> 03:50:23.820]  That's where we've got the beachhead, and we've got to start supporting the grassroots,
[03:50:23.820 --> 03:50:29.140]  hard chargers, not more establishment swamp creatures that have been in the baby swamps
[03:50:29.140 --> 03:50:30.980]  to then be sent to the big daddy swamp.
[03:50:30.980 --> 03:50:31.980]  Sorry, go ahead.
[03:50:31.980 --> 03:50:34.060]  Look, let's be very clear.
[03:50:34.060 --> 03:50:37.380]  Luther Strange is Mitch McConnell's bitch.
[03:50:37.380 --> 03:50:41.540]  He will vote against the president when Mitch McConnell directs it to.
[03:50:41.540 --> 03:50:46.580]  One of the biggest problems in Washington today is that Republicans don't fear the president
[03:50:46.580 --> 03:50:47.580]  anymore.
[03:50:47.580 --> 03:50:52.340]  It's been a long time since he's taken a liberal Republican scalp, and therefore they now
[03:50:52.340 --> 03:50:54.540]  believe you can flout the president.
[03:50:54.540 --> 03:50:55.980]  You can undermine him.
[03:50:55.980 --> 03:51:01.220]  You can even attack him as Mitch McConnell did yesterday, and he will do nothing.
[03:51:01.220 --> 03:51:06.340]  Alabama was a unique opportunity to show that that's not the case.
[03:51:06.340 --> 03:51:12.700]  I believe if Luther Strange makes the runoff, he may get removed because of his looming ethical
[03:51:12.700 --> 03:51:13.980]  problems.
[03:51:13.980 --> 03:51:20.980]  There is one solid Bible-based Trump-supporting conservative in this race who will stand up
[03:51:20.980 --> 03:51:24.380]  for the Trump agenda, and that is my friend, Randy Brinson.
[03:51:24.380 --> 03:51:25.380]  Let's expand on that.
[03:51:25.380 --> 03:51:30.260]  We don't want to send anybody there with any hint of corruption, bottom line, because we're
[03:51:30.260 --> 03:51:31.260]  good people.
[03:51:31.260 --> 03:51:34.420]  But plus, exactly don't send a scalp to the Democrats.
[03:51:34.420 --> 03:51:37.020]  Don't send somebody with a crooked toenail up there.
[03:51:37.020 --> 03:51:40.300]  We don't want to send career politicians with all their dirt there.
[03:51:40.300 --> 03:51:44.180]  For multiple reasons, we don't want to give them a whole other scandal.
[03:51:44.180 --> 03:51:49.660]  Well, as Dr. Brinson, how do you feel about, go ahead.
[03:51:49.660 --> 03:51:51.540]  Well, here's the thing.
[03:51:51.540 --> 03:51:55.020]  You nailed it, both you and Alex, but here's even more important.
[03:51:55.020 --> 03:52:01.300]  I have the only plan that can pass with Democrat-Republican votes for Obamacare replacement.
[03:52:01.300 --> 03:52:03.220]  If we don't, all we want to do is just repeal it.
[03:52:03.220 --> 03:52:07.020]  If we don't have the votes to repeal, then we have to have a plan to put in place, and
[03:52:07.020 --> 03:52:12.420]  we have that plan in place that will cap Medicaid spending, create competition for Medicaid
[03:52:12.420 --> 03:52:16.820]  patients to take care of them, and that will actually work, and we can use that model in
[03:52:16.820 --> 03:52:19.100]  Alabama throughout the nation.
[03:52:19.100 --> 03:52:22.940]  I just want the opportunity, I'm challenging the White House to let me go meet with the
[03:52:22.940 --> 03:52:27.300]  President and his advisors to show them this plan, and I promise you that that thing will
[03:52:27.300 --> 03:52:31.020]  get through Congress if we allow that to go forward.
[03:52:31.020 --> 03:52:32.020]  That's very important.
[03:52:32.020 --> 03:52:35.380]  Otherwise, we're going to go bankrupt with Obamacare in the next six to eight months,
[03:52:35.380 --> 03:52:37.100]  and then you lose all your majorities.
[03:52:37.100 --> 03:52:41.780]  We'll be voted out because of inaction by the Republican leadership.
[03:52:41.780 --> 03:52:46.860]  Not only that, but of course, if we lose control of the House, well, then they'll use a trumped-up
[03:52:46.860 --> 03:52:53.060]  phony charge cooked up by Mr. Mueller to remove our president, and Mitch McConnell will stand
[03:52:53.060 --> 03:52:59.820]  on the sidelines and do nothing, probably applaud, actually.
[03:52:59.820 --> 03:53:04.380]  Tell us the date of the special election in Alabama, and tell me how you feel about the
[03:53:04.380 --> 03:53:05.380]  campaign trail.
[03:53:05.380 --> 03:53:09.020]  Well, August 15th is a big day, Roger.
[03:53:09.020 --> 03:53:11.020]  That's next Tuesday.
[03:53:11.020 --> 03:53:12.660]  We're riding the thick of it.
[03:53:12.660 --> 03:53:14.860]  You can't poll an election like this.
[03:53:14.860 --> 03:53:15.860]  You're being serious.
[03:53:15.860 --> 03:53:20.100]  You can't poll it because it's going to be a low turnout, middle of the summer election.
[03:53:20.100 --> 03:53:23.020]  People are going to be at the beach or the lake or somewhere on that Tuesdays, many of
[03:53:23.020 --> 03:53:24.020]  them.
[03:53:24.020 --> 03:53:27.540]  So it's going to be the hardcore people, and those are people that usually support me.
[03:53:27.540 --> 03:53:31.340]  So if they don't get discouraged, this is all to discourage turnout and discourage our
[03:53:31.340 --> 03:53:32.340]  people.
[03:53:32.340 --> 03:53:36.700]  So the Trump people turn out, the Trump nation turns out, citizen for Trump, and the people
[03:53:36.700 --> 03:53:42.940]  that supported Trump's agenda, we can still win this race because we've got the ideas.
[03:53:42.940 --> 03:53:45.500]  We've got the reason to actually have some.
[03:53:45.500 --> 03:53:46.500]  That's right.
[03:53:46.500 --> 03:53:47.740]  Trump's not fighting alone.
[03:53:47.740 --> 03:53:51.860]  We're out there fighting, and when the swamp has a victory, we can grab that away from
[03:53:51.860 --> 03:53:55.620]  them, grab that victory right out of their jaws and give it to ourselves and the American
[03:53:55.620 --> 03:54:00.980]  people and the future if we get the word out that all over the country, races like this,
[03:54:00.980 --> 03:54:04.860]  that when the swamp, you know, tricks Trump into endorsing somebody, it's okay.
[03:54:04.860 --> 03:54:07.140]  We all just go against the swamp.
[03:54:07.140 --> 03:54:08.140]  Yeah.
[03:54:08.140 --> 03:54:09.140]  Exactly right.
[03:54:09.140 --> 03:54:10.140]  Exactly right.
[03:54:10.140 --> 03:54:11.860]  That's what we need to do.
[03:54:11.860 --> 03:54:14.100]  And the thing is, we just got to fight back, Alex and Roger.
[03:54:14.100 --> 03:54:16.620]  We got to fight back with all this misinformation.
[03:54:16.620 --> 03:54:20.180]  I think the president was misinformed intentionally.
[03:54:20.180 --> 03:54:23.980]  I think it was intentionally misinformed, and if we can get the president's ear, even at
[03:54:23.980 --> 03:54:28.420]  this late hour, I think he can see, he can take his own heads about who were giving him
[03:54:28.420 --> 03:54:29.420]  wrong information.
[03:54:29.420 --> 03:54:31.140]  That's been the whole problem with the White House.
[03:54:31.140 --> 03:54:34.900]  He's trusting people because he's a trusting person, and he's trusting the wrong people
[03:54:34.900 --> 03:54:39.460]  that give him misinformation to try to discredit, to get their way instead of doing what really
[03:54:39.460 --> 03:54:42.380]  needs to be happened for the American people.
[03:54:42.380 --> 03:54:44.460]  You know, it's really extraordinary.
[03:54:44.460 --> 03:54:49.700]  Since the beginning of this broadcast, my cell phone has rung twice with a call from
[03:54:49.700 --> 03:54:56.620]  a heavy-duty Washington lobbyist who sent me a text saying, drop a Brinson, can get you
[03:54:56.620 --> 03:54:59.860]  paid by strange immediately.
[03:54:59.860 --> 03:55:01.620]  This is what we're up against.
[03:55:01.620 --> 03:55:06.060]  This is the kind of crap that goes on in the swamp.
[03:55:06.060 --> 03:55:12.980]  I happen to know in the case of Randy's campaign, Dr. Brinson's campaign, the first five Republican
[03:55:12.980 --> 03:55:18.020]  pollsters he attempted to retain to help him analyze the race were all pressured out of
[03:55:18.020 --> 03:55:22.580]  working for him by none other than Mitch McConnell.
[03:55:22.580 --> 03:55:25.340]  So this is an inside game.
[03:55:25.340 --> 03:55:31.580]  There is only one Trump supporter and solid evangelical Christian conservative who can
[03:55:31.580 --> 03:55:36.100]  win this race and beat the Democrats, and that's Dr. Randy Brinson.
[03:55:36.100 --> 03:55:39.740]  Dr. Brinson, thanks for joining us here at InfoWars.
[03:55:39.740 --> 03:55:41.340]  Thank you, Alex, and thank you, Roger.
[03:55:41.340 --> 03:55:42.340]  Appreciate everything.
[03:55:42.340 --> 03:55:46.820]  Appreciate all you do for American people.
[03:55:46.820 --> 03:55:53.700]  Moving along, I must say, I just looked at the 1776 specials at the InfoWars store, and
[03:55:53.700 --> 03:55:55.940]  it blows me away.
[03:55:55.940 --> 03:56:02.260]  Mrs. Stone is particularly happy that the new super blue fluoride toothpaste, mouthwash,
[03:56:02.260 --> 03:56:06.100]  can be had for $17.76.
[03:56:06.100 --> 03:56:11.780]  She started using this right after she started using the super blue fluoride-free toothpaste,
[03:56:11.780 --> 03:56:15.020]  which is now a real favorite in the Stone household.
[03:56:15.020 --> 03:56:18.460]  My grandson, Nicholas, has actually stolen mine.
[03:56:18.460 --> 03:56:23.460]  I have to order more because he liked mine so much, well, he took it.
[03:56:23.460 --> 03:56:27.940]  But if you look at these prices, folks, they will blow you away.
[03:56:27.940 --> 03:56:33.820]  Brainforce, which I assure you is absolutely necessary for me to do this show.
[03:56:33.820 --> 03:56:36.620]  What is it about kids stealing your toiletries?
[03:56:36.620 --> 03:56:43.260]  My son never steals anything, but my razors and my deodorant and my tooth, he uses my
[03:56:43.260 --> 03:56:45.860]  bathroom like Walgreens.
[03:56:45.860 --> 03:56:46.860]  What is it about that?
[03:56:46.860 --> 03:56:48.980]  They're like raccoons.
[03:56:48.980 --> 03:56:54.100]  I go to pop a brain force because I have to write a paper or do a conference call, and
[03:56:54.100 --> 03:56:55.100]  it's not there.
[03:56:55.100 --> 03:56:58.260]  When I asked my grandson, Nick, what happened, he said, oh, I had to work yesterday.
[03:56:58.260 --> 03:57:00.140]  I took it.
[03:57:00.140 --> 03:57:05.860]  I guess they feel a license, but they ought to go on the site and buy their own.
[03:57:05.860 --> 03:57:07.980]  Brainforce, 55% off.
[03:57:07.980 --> 03:57:10.300]  That's never happened before.
[03:57:10.300 --> 03:57:14.100]  Survival shield, X2, 55% off.
[03:57:14.100 --> 03:57:16.780]  Secret 12, 55% off.
[03:57:16.780 --> 03:57:19.580]  Steel of oregano, 40% off.
[03:57:19.580 --> 03:57:25.500]  Alex, you have cut prices to the bone here with some of your best products.
[03:57:25.500 --> 03:57:29.340]  I agree with some of you said earlier, buy with the good guys.
[03:57:29.340 --> 03:57:34.140]  When you support the Info War store, you support the fight for freedom.
[03:57:34.140 --> 03:57:38.420]  You support the fight against the never-truthers and the globalists.
[03:57:38.420 --> 03:57:39.540]  We're not just saying that.
[03:57:39.540 --> 03:57:44.700]  We have them all coming after us because you are the Info War.
[03:57:44.700 --> 03:57:49.540]  The summer is always a very, very dead time for sales-wise in talk radio period, but I've
[03:57:49.540 --> 03:57:53.420]  already just been cutting things more and more because we don't like raise prices and
[03:57:53.420 --> 03:57:54.420]  then have 55% off.
[03:57:54.420 --> 03:57:56.780]  I mean, this is 55% off.
[03:57:56.780 --> 03:57:57.980]  The price is always the same.
[03:57:57.980 --> 03:58:01.100]  People see that because we do discounts, and we're doing this because we found we bring
[03:58:01.100 --> 03:58:04.580]  in even more money when we cut it down to almost nothing.
[03:58:04.580 --> 03:58:06.180]  But I'll tell you, some of these are lost leaders.
[03:58:06.180 --> 03:58:10.620]  When you sign up for auto-ship, you get an additional 10% off, especially the 50% off
[03:58:10.620 --> 03:58:12.220]  on the silver products.
[03:58:12.220 --> 03:58:15.620]  That baby is a lost leader right there without that even happening.
[03:58:15.620 --> 03:58:16.620]  But we're doing it.
[03:58:16.620 --> 03:58:17.620]  Roger, amazing.
[03:58:17.620 --> 03:58:18.620]  Thanks for letting me go.
[03:58:18.620 --> 03:58:23.340]  It's fun to be able to eat my late lunch and then kind of just pop in here obnoxiously.
[03:58:23.340 --> 03:58:24.340]  So thank you.
[03:58:24.340 --> 03:58:25.940]  We're all in this together, my friend.
[03:58:25.940 --> 03:58:26.940]  And so a lot more I'll be breaking.
[03:58:26.940 --> 03:58:30.580]  I know in the next few days, look forward to having you right here with Info Wars coming
[03:58:30.580 --> 03:58:34.700]  up in early September with the launch of your own weekday transmission.
[03:58:34.700 --> 03:58:36.900]  So thank you so much, Roger.
[03:58:36.900 --> 03:58:39.220]  Alex, victory or death?
[03:58:39.220 --> 03:58:40.220]  That's right.
[03:58:40.220 --> 03:58:41.220]  They'll never take us alive.
[03:58:41.220 --> 03:58:44.980]  We mean that figuratively, politically, we're never giving up, no surrender.
