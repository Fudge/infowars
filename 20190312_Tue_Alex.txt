[00:00.000 --> 00:18.560]  It's gradually becoming clear to anyone questioning the science and statistics generated by the
[00:18.560 --> 00:24.480]  vaccine industry that they will be silenced by the gods of Silicon Valley if they do not
[00:24.480 --> 00:31.520]  speak glowingly of vaccinations. A logical adult conversation about the pros and cons of vaccines
[00:31.520 --> 00:38.400]  is no longer an option. If you could share additional ideas about the you developed over
[00:38.400 --> 00:44.400]  because of the experience you've had as to how to effectively reach out to parents and address
[00:44.400 --> 00:53.040]  their concerns so that they are confident in the advice of their doctors and don't hesitate to have
[00:53.040 --> 00:57.120]  their children immunized. I know you've spoken to this a little bit already. Yes thank you for
[00:57.120 --> 01:01.040]  that question actually because there's a really important distinction things we make made between
[01:01.040 --> 01:06.240]  the information provided as we discussed earlier when you see that with a lot of the anti-vaccine
[01:06.240 --> 01:11.520]  community that a large portion of the foundation that they build to communicate with parents is
[01:11.520 --> 01:17.200]  on a very anecdotal level sharing stories and experiences and that speaks volumes to people
[01:17.200 --> 01:21.600]  because at least for even my family my mom would reaffirm that her position was correct because
[01:21.600 --> 01:27.920]  she knows people and she's seen stories regardless that roughly four billion dollars has been quietly
[01:27.920 --> 01:34.400]  doled out from vaccine related injuries according to the national vaccine injury compensation program
[01:34.400 --> 01:39.120]  despite the government admitting to and paying four billion dollars for vaccine injuries no
[01:39.120 --> 01:45.200]  informed consent is used or required when you vaccinate your child this may be the only medical
[01:45.200 --> 01:50.960]  procedure in today's medical world where an informed consent is not required but if the fear of this
[01:50.960 --> 01:59.120]  is valid are we to find that next will be mandating flu vaccines between 12 and 56 thousand people
[01:59.120 --> 02:04.080]  die from the flu or are said to die from the flu in America and there's estimated to be a few
[02:04.080 --> 02:08.080]  hundred from measles so I would guess that those who want to mandate measles will be after us on
[02:08.080 --> 02:13.680]  the flu next yet the current science only allows for educated guessing when it comes to the flu
[02:13.680 --> 02:20.160]  vaccine each year before that year's flu vaccine is or strain is known the scientists put their best
[02:20.160 --> 02:25.920]  guess into that year's vaccine some years it's completely wrong we vaccinate for the wrong
[02:25.920 --> 02:33.520]  strand of the wrong strain of a flu vaccine yet five states already mandate flu vaccines is it
[02:33.520 --> 02:39.120]  really appropriate appropriate to mandate a vaccine that more often than not vaccinate for the wrong
[02:39.120 --> 02:45.600]  flu strain as we contemplate forcing parents to choose this or that vaccine I think it's important
[02:45.600 --> 02:51.280]  to remember that force is not consistent with the american story nor is force consistent consistent
[02:51.280 --> 02:56.320]  with the liberty our forefathers saw when they came to America I don't think you have to have one
[02:56.320 --> 03:00.720]  of the other though I'm not here to say don't vaccinate your kids if this appearing is for
[03:00.720 --> 03:06.640]  persuasion I'm all for the persuasion I vaccinated myself I vaccinated my kids for myself and my
[03:06.640 --> 03:11.840]  children I believe that the benefits of vaccines greatly outweigh the risks but I still do not
[03:11.840 --> 03:18.640]  favor giving up on liberty for a false sense of security of course vaccines are also responsible
[03:18.640 --> 03:25.840]  for disease prevention as the cdc estimates that vaccinations will prevent more than 21 million
[03:25.840 --> 03:33.760]  hospitalizations and 732 000 deaths among children born in the last 20 years but the true debate
[03:33.760 --> 03:43.200]  remains at a standstill as since 1988 over 20,428 petitions have been filed with the vicp over
[03:43.200 --> 03:53.920]  that 30 year time period 17,718 petitions have been adjudicated with 6,430 of those determined to be
[03:53.920 --> 04:01.600]  compensable while 11,288 were dismissed and again total compensation paid over the life of the
[04:01.600 --> 04:08.640]  program is approximately four billion children today are expected to endure 36 vaccinations
[04:08.640 --> 04:16.240]  within the same time period that my generation generation x received just five to 13 vaccinations
[04:16.240 --> 04:24.160]  maximum meanwhile cases of autism have skyrocketed since the early 90s it's not rocket science but it
[04:24.160 --> 04:30.800]  is a dangerously unresolved medical crisis that deserves further open debate if it is ever to
[04:30.800 --> 04:37.120]  be truly addressed furthermore the censorship of the debate represents a glaring example of the
[04:37.120 --> 04:43.360]  vicious attack on free speech by the industries violating that free speech for their own corporate
[04:43.360 --> 05:02.720]  credit gain john bound reporting well i've got some really good news for all the viewers and
[05:02.720 --> 05:06.320]  all the listeners this was going to be a big loss because we couldn't get the deep breath crystals
[05:06.320 --> 05:11.120]  anymore 20 year and a half fight but we have the original producer the original crystal source
[05:11.120 --> 05:16.400]  the best atomic iodine in the world x two is back we got it this deal just happened about a
[05:16.400 --> 05:21.520]  month ago we rushed it into production it's been bottled the labels are being put on today and
[05:21.520 --> 05:27.120]  that it's going to be on an 18 wheeler right here to austin from the plant in the rockies and it's
[05:27.120 --> 05:32.640]  going to be shipped out to you be sure and sign up for auto ship then an additional 10 off the 25
[05:32.640 --> 05:37.360]  percent off celebration of the fact that we got it back and we're relaunching it research the iodine
[05:37.360 --> 05:42.080]  conspiracy find out why it's so important find out what the globalists don't want you to have
[05:42.640 --> 05:48.000]  the good halogen you have the bad halogens at info war store dot com that's the umbrella site
[05:48.000 --> 05:52.400]  enforce life dot com makes you write the supplements and this is the king daddy
[05:52.400 --> 06:08.320]  uh ladies and gentlemen it is x2 original now back at info war store dot com
[06:11.440 --> 06:19.600]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well so does he
[06:19.600 --> 06:24.400]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[06:28.400 --> 06:32.960]  oh and shroy are filling in for alex jones on this tuesday march 12 2019
[06:34.960 --> 06:40.720]  and as of right now we have a wide open broadcast leo zigami may be joining us
[06:40.720 --> 06:50.560]  to talk about a story where the yellow vests are going after a masonic lodge so the media
[06:50.560 --> 06:55.520]  is trying to acting like the yellow vests uh protests aren't still going on they are
[06:56.720 --> 07:04.880]  paul joseph watson will host the fourth hour and between now and then i have stacks and stacks
[07:04.880 --> 07:11.120]  and stacks and stacks and stacks and stacks of news to get to but you know
[07:12.960 --> 07:17.920]  it's not that i feel pressure when i come on air here and i know i'm about to be
[07:17.920 --> 07:31.760]  speaking to millions of people the pressure is to be as concise and focused and concentrated and
[07:31.760 --> 07:39.280]  understanding the real issues at the root of the problems as i possibly can be and then being
[07:39.280 --> 07:47.200]  clairvoyant enough to lay them out in a matter that is understandable and persuasive
[07:49.360 --> 07:57.440]  and there's a lot of distractions here on planet earth there's a lot of trivial things that
[07:57.440 --> 08:06.480]  that we become obsessed with and there's a lot of selfish narcissistic tendencies
[08:07.680 --> 08:11.920]  that are always going to plague us as humans but
[08:14.400 --> 08:22.080]  how do you decide where you land on the map how do you decide what you stand for how do you decide
[08:22.080 --> 08:28.160]  what to stand and fight for how do you decide where you draw the line in the sand
[08:32.160 --> 08:40.320]  and for me personally watching that john bouncer port in the first segment and just covering all
[08:40.320 --> 08:48.400]  the vaccine news for that i have for the last week and a half now i know where i stand
[08:48.400 --> 08:57.680]  i know my mission and you know what it's ugly to be in the position that we're in here at info
[08:57.680 --> 09:05.840]  wars because you know what at the end of the day i mean i do everything i can to bring you as much
[09:05.840 --> 09:10.320]  news as possible and then tie the dots together and then show you what that means for the future
[09:10.320 --> 09:20.080]  but but this is what info wars role really is it's to sit here like a rock in the way of tyranny
[09:22.560 --> 09:29.920]  that's our role that's my role and you know what if alex jones has to be a little rambunctious
[09:29.920 --> 09:36.480]  in that role if i have to be a little loud and aggressive in that role then god bless us
[09:36.480 --> 09:45.600]  because when you look out on the horizon
[09:48.160 --> 09:55.040]  sometimes you feel like you're all alone and nobody wants to stand in the way of this
[09:55.040 --> 10:03.440]  unstoppable force known as tyranny and the vaccines is just an example just a microcosm
[10:03.440 --> 10:12.240]  but if you can somehow red pill someone on the issue of vaccines then maybe they can start
[10:12.240 --> 10:15.760]  to understand everything it's kind of like yesterday how i talked about the loose thread
[10:18.400 --> 10:23.280]  was the fact that it was actually hillary clinton that colluded with russia not donald trump in the
[10:23.280 --> 10:27.520]  2016 presidential election and you pull that loose thread all of a sudden the emperor has no clothes
[10:27.520 --> 10:32.960]  this isn't about me telling you not to take a vaccine this isn't about me telling you the vaccines
[10:32.960 --> 10:38.000]  are causing autism this isn't about me telling you they're putting cancer viruses in the vaccines
[10:38.000 --> 10:44.960]  that jack into your dna because they have it all studied and they know that if your dna has this
[10:44.960 --> 10:50.480]  deficiency you're going to get cancer you're prone to it so they jack it into the vaccine and then
[10:50.480 --> 10:57.920]  the vaccine and then bing pediatric cancer shoots up a thousand percent that's not what i'm here to
[10:57.920 --> 11:03.200]  tell you you can do that research for yourself you can believe what you want to believe about that
[11:04.720 --> 11:08.880]  but here's well i will stand till the death
[11:12.720 --> 11:16.080]  americans right to choose whether they get to take a vaccine or not
[11:16.080 --> 11:24.000]  and that's our role here at info wars to stand in the way defiant like a rock
[11:27.120 --> 11:32.880]  in this wave of tyranny we will not move
[11:37.840 --> 11:44.160]  and you're right there behind us as part of the rock we're all this rock standing in the
[11:44.160 --> 11:50.640]  way of tyranny together and there's another level to that now
[11:54.880 --> 11:57.200]  i didn't even know that this was going to be in the news today
[11:58.080 --> 12:02.720]  and it's funny because i had a whole list of notes breaking down the democrats pulling back
[12:02.720 --> 12:09.680]  from impeachment i left it at home but it's no big deal because it's much more important than this
[12:09.680 --> 12:16.640]  this comes out of c nbc the man who invented the web says it's now dysfunctional with perverse
[12:16.640 --> 12:24.560]  incentives as a regular user of the internet to put it lightly you could say obsessive
[12:26.480 --> 12:30.480]  i've been reporting on this for a while folks the internet is different than it was five years
[12:30.480 --> 12:34.720]  ago the internet is different than it was two years ago seo's are different than they were two
[12:34.720 --> 12:40.320]  years ago google has the whole thing rigged and algorithmed and censored so much that even alternative
[12:41.760 --> 12:48.800]  seo's like duck duck go can't even work properly and i'm just seeing it all in real time
[12:51.360 --> 12:59.760]  but the internet again is just a microcosm of the world the world is just as rigged as the internet
[12:59.760 --> 13:09.760]  the world is just as censored as the internet and i realized something last night
[13:09.920 --> 13:19.760]  through my own life and my own experience but really it's just common sense and it's always been true
[13:19.760 --> 13:28.880]  you will be blind in this world if you are not connected to god
[13:31.760 --> 13:38.400]  because there'll be someday believe me and who knows how many times we've already been down this
[13:38.400 --> 13:46.000]  road we could be going down this road right now as we speak there'll be someday where they'll say
[13:46.000 --> 13:53.360]  there was not ever two genders where men and women never even got married had kids and that's
[13:53.360 --> 13:58.320]  just one example i mean you're already seeing it you're already seeing the slippery slope and so
[13:58.320 --> 14:05.760]  there'll be a time we're saying that two plus two equals four is considered insane is considered
[14:05.760 --> 14:12.560]  lunacy but how will you know what's real how do you look at the world and know what's real
[14:12.560 --> 14:19.200]  how do you listen to what people say and know if they're genuine or not
[14:22.320 --> 14:26.640]  you have to ask for god's vision you have to ask for god's discernment and you have to
[14:27.600 --> 14:34.640]  really truly seek it out and you have to find that connection and if you lack that connection
[14:34.640 --> 14:44.960]  you will be blind in this world and so you can sit here and talk about whatever is behind it the
[14:44.960 --> 14:52.480]  illuminati the deep state satan it doesn't matter it all has the same result and if you're not connected
[14:52.480 --> 15:00.160]  to the creator you will be blind in this world you will be deceived you will believe all of
[15:00.160 --> 15:09.760]  satan's lies because they come off as the truth and it's it's it's kind of the same thing where
[15:09.760 --> 15:13.840]  somebody's trying to tell you that two plus two equals five and it's like okay i'm not even gonna
[15:13.840 --> 15:19.760]  try to argue with you i know it equals four but go on believing what you believe and you can look
[15:19.760 --> 15:26.720]  around and you find kindred spirits that are like yeah i know it equals four you know we don't know
[15:26.720 --> 15:33.440]  what's wrong with this person but slowly but surely they're trying to get rid of god they're
[15:33.440 --> 15:37.920]  trying to get rid of common sense they're censoring reality they're rigging reality
[15:37.920 --> 15:42.080]  they're rigging the internet they're censoring the internet and it's all about total control
[15:44.480 --> 15:51.120]  and so when i sit here and think about my role as i host the alex joneshow today it's to stand here
[15:51.120 --> 15:58.640]  like a rock in the face of tyranny never ever to be moved we will always stand against tyranny
[15:59.520 --> 16:06.320]  maybe not today maybe not tomorrow but soon you'll need a plan and place to survive forget

[21:16.640 --> 21:22.080]  but i just realized you know i the the media does this whole thing where they want to make
[21:22.080 --> 21:29.360]  you feel like a piece of crap and there's multiple waves and levels of this where
[21:29.920 --> 21:35.680]  first they create a degenerative society then you engage in the degenerative society
[21:35.680 --> 21:40.320]  then you become the degenerative society then you just are a degenerate
[21:42.560 --> 21:47.360]  and so yeah once you've become a degenerate and you don't take care of your mental health you
[21:47.360 --> 21:52.640]  don't take care of your physical health you really don't even give a damn about anything then it's
[21:52.640 --> 21:59.760]  really easy to feel like a piece of crap isn't it because well maybe you are and so they use that
[21:59.760 --> 22:06.960]  against you so that you have this whole self reflection of feeling like garbage and then
[22:06.960 --> 22:11.280]  when you feel like garbage and like nothing you're never going to try to change the world
[22:11.280 --> 22:19.440]  you're never going to stand against evil and i realized in my own skin it's not that i feel guilty
[22:20.800 --> 22:28.400]  but i've always thought you know look i i'm no choir boy i'm not perfect who am i to stand up
[22:30.000 --> 22:36.800]  and be righteous in the face of wickedness who am i to stand here
[22:36.800 --> 22:46.960]  to be a leader i'm nothing i'm i'm fallen i'm weak i've made mistakes but then i realized
[22:47.600 --> 22:52.800]  as long as you stand against evil and as long as you're firm against tyranny
[22:54.160 --> 23:01.520]  you cannot lose we cannot lose they can destroy us in the process and they've been trying to
[23:01.520 --> 23:08.160]  do and that's just victory because that's what this whole fight is all about
[23:10.320 --> 23:14.000]  and who knows if we'll ever be able to fix all the corruption and evil that's
[23:14.800 --> 23:22.240]  occupying this planet this reality but you'll always have victory if you fight it
[23:22.240 --> 23:32.400]  but then i realized the level of propaganda that even i fall for thinking less of myself because
[23:32.400 --> 23:40.000]  i'm worldly instead of thinking no you are a good person you're trying to be better you're
[23:40.000 --> 23:46.640]  trying to help people you're trying to change the world so are you out there and so we have to realize
[23:46.640 --> 23:56.400]  look we're not saints we're sinners and we've all fallen to the wicked deceptions
[23:58.480 --> 24:01.520]  and the gravity
[24:01.520 --> 24:15.520]  of all the things that give us short-term satisfaction instead of realizing the bigger picture
[24:16.560 --> 24:22.880]  and instead of channeling the things that are universal and we know are good
[24:25.120 --> 24:30.320]  but we're we're kind of starting to get back on our feet right now we're we're kind of starting
[24:30.320 --> 24:35.920]  to realize what we have to do here and that's because the true evil is rearing its head
[24:36.880 --> 24:42.480]  when they go for late term abortion when they use propaganda to force you to take a vaccine
[24:44.400 --> 24:53.200]  and so you know what you can be the biggest degenerate out there but if you stand against
[24:53.200 --> 25:00.800]  tyranny then you're better than most of your counterparts if you're willing to take that
[25:00.800 --> 25:07.040]  mantle and this isn't me patting me on the back or patting you on the back i just want you to realize
[25:07.040 --> 25:15.120]  that for example watching the tucker carlson opening segment last night whether you think he
[25:15.120 --> 25:19.760]  should be fired or not whether you think his comments were too far or not it doesn't matter
[25:19.760 --> 25:27.120]  it's the fact that tucker stood there and said i'm not going to be bullied i'm not going to let
[25:27.120 --> 25:37.600]  hate mobs deter me from my mission from my goal now tucker carlson isn't perfect never claimed to be
[25:38.320 --> 25:40.320]  info wars isn't perfect never claimed to be
[25:43.120 --> 25:48.400]  but here's one promise that info wars will always deliver on and that's we're going to stand
[25:48.400 --> 25:53.200]  like a rock against tyranny and so you're not going to force vaccinate
[25:55.120 --> 25:56.800]  you're not going to late term term abort
[25:59.520 --> 26:04.000]  you're not going to censor reality and censor the internet and get away with it
[26:05.440 --> 26:09.440]  you might do it you will do it you have done it
[26:12.000 --> 26:15.120]  but we're going to continue to call it out despite all the threats
[26:15.120 --> 26:24.000]  despite all the attacks and despite everything now i think i've gotten everything i need to
[26:24.000 --> 26:29.280]  off my chest here today and i'm going to get to some news and probably open up the phone lines
[26:29.280 --> 26:37.920]  as well but as we are nearing the 2020 election cycle we do have a lot of important philosophical
[26:37.920 --> 26:44.880]  questions to ask ourselves and the tricky thing to realize is
[26:47.520 --> 26:58.160]  here we are today march 2019 a year from now march 2020 will be nearing the nomination process
[26:58.160 --> 27:14.480]  but just imagine this march 2020 is going to be so diametrically different than march 2019
[27:15.360 --> 27:21.600]  i'm not even going to try to figure it out but i can tell you if i'm sitting in this studio
[27:21.600 --> 27:30.400]  a year from today the world as we know it is not going to be the same because we're in a quickening
[27:32.880 --> 27:35.760]  the vortex of reality is tightening
[27:38.160 --> 27:45.760]  and so everything is happening until we reach the singularity which is the bottom of the vortex
[27:45.760 --> 27:54.160]  so i understand it's easy to get dizzy it's easy to get disoriented it's easy to get confused but
[27:54.160 --> 28:01.680]  that's why you have to humble yourself and just sink into the sand as the waves wash over you
[28:02.240 --> 28:12.320]  and just affirm your stance against tyranny like a big gigantic rock as the waves crash against it
[28:12.320 --> 28:18.880]  and those waves are going to crash against it a lot and it's going to reshape that rock it's
[28:18.880 --> 28:25.920]  going to create sand off that rock but as long as you're there as that rock stopping that flow
[28:25.920 --> 28:34.240]  of tyranny that is victory and that's what we do at info wars and that's what this audience does
[28:35.200 --> 28:39.520]  and that's what hopefully more people in this country are going to do around the world are
[28:39.520 --> 28:44.960]  going to do and maybe just maybe we can get them in the right positions of power in the government
[28:44.960 --> 28:52.640]  and industry to clear up some of this corruption and disgust that has overwhelmed our culture
[28:53.600 --> 28:57.760]  and our society news on the other side this is the alex joan show don't go anywhere

[33:09.680 --> 33:29.680]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the alex joneshow with owin treuer
[33:40.400 --> 33:51.680]  oh
[33:58.240 --> 33:59.680]  you know i'm really not sure
[33:59.680 --> 34:11.840]  how you address a country that suffers the number i think is about 20 000 deaths
[34:13.040 --> 34:19.120]  because of september 11th 2001 3000 that day tens of thousands in the aftermath
[34:20.560 --> 34:26.480]  and we blamed radical islam spent trillions of dollars fighting radical islam and now we never
[34:26.480 --> 34:31.440]  ended that war we never said that that was a false narrative we never said it wasn't radical islam
[34:31.440 --> 34:35.040]  and now we're told to embrace islam or we're islamophobic
[34:37.120 --> 34:41.920]  and i was actually listening to a powerful interview michael savage had with a muslim author
[34:42.960 --> 34:48.480]  and i won't get into the weeds on it but but basically and you have the iranian restart
[34:48.480 --> 34:55.280]  happening right now but imagine i mean there's billions of muslims in the world okay not all
[34:55.280 --> 34:59.520]  of them want to kill the united states of america not all of them want to wipe israel off the map
[34:59.520 --> 35:05.920]  it's just the extreme ones that do and their religious leadership promotes those ideas
[35:06.480 --> 35:13.120]  and there is basically a seventh century form of islam that is still pretty much in power
[35:14.080 --> 35:18.560]  it basically be like if christians were basically orthodox christians and engage in all the fasting
[35:18.560 --> 35:24.560]  and all the other stuff that the bible talks about they don't but listening to this woman
[35:24.560 --> 35:30.160]  she highlights something that's not talked about enough how there are muslim heretics
[35:31.520 --> 35:37.760]  it's like imagine the left in america you've got the left in america that's gone totally extreme
[35:37.760 --> 35:43.760]  out of their minds violent hateful disgusting but that's not all of them and there's some
[35:43.760 --> 35:46.720]  that are seeing that and they're kind of like okay well we need to leave that we need to get
[35:46.720 --> 35:51.200]  away from that we need to find something else that's actually happening in the religion of islam
[35:51.200 --> 35:57.280]  right now but the media doesn't want you to hear about that and there's a multiple layers as to
[35:57.280 --> 36:05.840]  why that is and i'm not even going to try to break that down but when i see the story that
[36:05.840 --> 36:11.040]  was just handed to me man yells allahu akbar at funeral of german woman murdered by muslim boyfriend
[36:11.040 --> 36:22.400]  it just continues this divide and
[36:24.800 --> 36:31.600]  i just don't know what to do at this point because we've been lied to so much about these wars in
[36:31.600 --> 36:37.440]  the middle east i mean most of them are funded by the west i mean it's a joke it's not all of them
[36:37.440 --> 36:43.360]  and then people say well that means they're funded by jews and so then you go down the whole zionist
[36:43.360 --> 36:47.120]  thing and it's like look man i'm just trying to figure out what the hell is going on here
[36:47.120 --> 36:51.520]  they tell us that 9 11 the biggest terror event us history was done by radical islam and they
[36:51.520 --> 36:56.880]  tell us to accept radical islam and then you have ilhan omar and rashidah talib saying allahu akbar
[36:56.880 --> 37:01.680]  and getting sworn in on a on a karan so it's like i don't know what the hell's going on
[37:01.680 --> 37:07.040]  but it doesn't make sense you see i just want things to make sense
[37:09.600 --> 37:16.400]  but if you're tommy robinson you're not even allowed to exist and they're trying to totally
[37:16.400 --> 37:21.920]  erase him just out off of the planet earth really i mean they'll erase him off the internet then
[37:21.920 --> 37:26.480]  they'll just throw him in jail and lock and throw away the key and you know you'll never hear from
[37:26.480 --> 37:36.400]  tom robinson again because how dare he call out a muslim uh i guess i don't even know what you
[37:36.400 --> 37:42.240]  would call it a group of muslims that were trafficking children basically you know he's not
[37:42.240 --> 37:48.320]  allowed to do that because you know muslims are somehow protected all of a sudden because i guess
[37:48.320 --> 37:53.920]  we lied about 9 11 and it wasn't really muslims but they never told us that did they so what are we
[37:53.920 --> 37:58.640]  to believe nothing we're just supposed to be confused fighting with each other for the rest of time
[37:59.200 --> 38:05.520]  that's what the establishment really wants but i'm pontificating here and i still haven't gotten
[38:05.520 --> 38:12.560]  to any of this important news like the democrats pulling back from impeachment which just tells you
[38:12.560 --> 38:19.920]  i mean even adam schiff is pulling back from impeachment so i i mean there are so many different
[38:19.920 --> 38:30.720]  reasons why that could be but you notice how the radical left's uh watch this won't even stop the
[38:30.720 --> 38:34.480]  radical left from going out in the street and calling for impeachment folks they've been so
[38:34.480 --> 38:43.200]  radicalized nancy you can't bring these people back into the barn they're gone you've radicalized
[38:43.200 --> 38:48.640]  the left so much adam schiff you can't wrangle them back up just because you're saying oh no
[38:48.640 --> 38:54.000]  impeachment isn't gonna work it's too late they already drank your kool-aid they're already on
[38:54.000 --> 39:02.240]  the suicide mission they're already in the death cult so adam schiff who says i've seen the russian
[39:02.240 --> 39:09.120]  collusion with my own eyes he now says well impeachment isn't a good option you are such a
[39:09.120 --> 39:18.160]  lying scumbag and much worse nancy polosi says impeachment just isn't worth it i'm not for it
[39:19.920 --> 39:25.200]  now if the democrats were honest people they'd say look we lied about the russian collusion thing
[39:26.080 --> 39:30.960]  we hyped up the mall report there's nothing there we're sorry but they're not gonna do that
[39:30.960 --> 39:36.000]  they're just to say oh it's not worth it oh we don't want to divide the country with impeachment
[39:36.000 --> 39:47.840]  you know you people are so satanic i can't even put words to it the deception these people engage in
[39:48.400 --> 39:55.680]  as they try to divide the country as they try to incite civil war as they try to incite race war
[39:55.680 --> 40:03.360]  to sit here and all the sudden act like they're choosing the path of righteousness oh well
[40:03.360 --> 40:09.680]  we don't want to do impeachment it'd be selfish and it divide the country you sacks of garbage
[40:09.680 --> 40:13.440]  know exactly you have been dividing this country for the last two years
[40:16.800 --> 40:24.800]  and so but see that's what i'm saying honestly folks the average human wouldn't even be able to
[40:24.800 --> 40:33.760]  see this they would have no clue and but you don't even have to be informed because that's what i'm
[40:33.760 --> 40:38.240]  saying like i can come on here and give you all the information that you want and give you all
[40:38.240 --> 40:43.920]  the information that you need to be informed if you're connected to god you don't need it
[40:45.280 --> 40:49.920]  you can look at a nancy polosi and an adam schiff and and you just have god's vision and you just
[40:49.920 --> 41:04.240]  know that is total evil you know i haven't even plugged today and the censorship continues to ramp
[41:04.240 --> 41:09.920]  up i have an entire stack of censorship news right here in front of me that i'm going to get to
[41:12.560 --> 41:18.640]  obviously alex jones totally banned the platform off the internet i've got one last place i've got
[41:18.640 --> 41:22.560]  twitter i'm personally banned off facebook and youtube i actually have the world record for
[41:22.560 --> 41:31.280]  sure to stay on facebook of 12 hours but you know what as long as the satanists and the statists
[41:32.000 --> 41:36.000]  and the people that want to abort their children and the people that want to force you to take a
[41:36.000 --> 41:41.760]  vaccine as long as they attack us and try to censor us and want to shut down i will just
[41:41.760 --> 41:50.000]  bask in their hatred i will revel i will revel in the fact that they want to shut down because
[41:50.000 --> 41:55.600]  that means we're doing something right i'm telling you we're not perfect it's not even close but man

[43:29.520 --> 43:35.360]  incredible now due to the establishment trying to block that we did more research and secured

[48:08.960 --> 48:15.280]  the best physical condition possible and while exercise is obviously key you also need to think
[48:15.280 --> 48:24.000]  about your diet and the truth is the average diet is not going to get you the vitamins and nutrients

[49:35.280 --> 49:42.880]  wants to break in with some big news but i'll tell you what let me just bear down here and get into
[49:42.880 --> 49:52.880]  these stacks of news so Nancy Pelosi has now come out and said she's not for impeachment
[49:52.880 --> 50:01.680]  and so what happened Nancy is Donald Trump all of a sudden not a bigot is Donald Trump all of a
[50:01.680 --> 50:08.400]  sudden not a russian agent is Donald Trump not all of a sudden the worst thing in the history of
[50:08.400 --> 50:15.520]  america like you guys act like he is so you don't want impeachment though oh i see Nancy you guys
[50:15.520 --> 50:24.160]  are taking the high road and you don't want to divide the country ah yes so Nancy Pelosi says
[50:24.160 --> 50:30.160]  well i still believe Trump is unfit for office i'd like to see your drug test Nancy Nancy Pelosi
[50:30.160 --> 50:34.880]  will never submit to a drug test because you'll see all the real health issues that she has
[50:34.880 --> 50:44.000]  ladies and gentlemen but she's no longer for impeachment because she doesn't want to divide
[50:44.000 --> 50:53.600]  the country oh Nancy thank god you're so moral and righteous oh i'm so glad that Nancy Pelosi
[50:53.600 --> 51:02.160]  doesn't want to divide the country anymore oh thank god oh what's this adam schiff now says
[51:02.160 --> 51:09.680]  impeachment gamble is not worth it wow and adam schiff says it would only be worth it if he had
[51:09.680 --> 51:18.640]  the very graphic evidence but wait a second little adam you said you did what happened adam adam
[51:20.240 --> 51:28.960]  oh adam remember when you told us you've seen the evidence with your little pal there in california
[51:28.960 --> 51:38.240]  eric swalwell what were you guys talking to ed buck about hmm remember ed buck your friend ed
[51:38.240 --> 51:44.640]  buck adam remember him remember the dead bodies found in his house remember him adam
[51:46.160 --> 51:52.880]  remember all the sex cults out in hollywood adam in your district remember all the child abuse
[51:52.880 --> 52:05.520]  that goes on out there little adam mm-hmm oh but adam what happened adam you said you've seen the
[52:05.520 --> 52:12.800]  evidence you said you had the evidence adam what happened well now you say impeachment gamble is not
[52:12.800 --> 52:24.800]  worth it without very graphic evidence but adam you said you had it wow and then he says this in
[52:24.800 --> 52:29.520]  the absence of very graphic evidence it would be difficult to get the support and the senate needed
[52:29.520 --> 52:34.880]  to make an impeachment successful my feeling is let's see what bob moeller produces but the
[52:34.880 --> 52:41.760]  evidence would have to be pretty overwhelming huh i thought you've seen the overwhelming evidence
[52:42.560 --> 52:48.560]  fact i bet you i could go find an old story and quote you exactly saying you have overwhelming
[52:48.560 --> 52:57.280]  evidence uh but you're a piece of you know what the kind of stuff that you walk a block in san
[52:57.280 --> 53:10.000]  francisco and smell everywhere little adam shift oh but don't worry republicans are out to divide
[53:10.000 --> 53:17.440]  this country too dick chaney former vice president he like i think he still has like the record for
[53:17.440 --> 53:24.560]  most heart surgeries or something these are like seven heart surgeries like each rarer than the one
[53:24.560 --> 53:29.840]  before it challenges pence on trump's foreign policy so yeah i mean dick chaney wants to
[53:29.840 --> 53:34.640]  invade every country bomb every country get filthy rich off of it because he probably has options
[53:34.640 --> 53:40.240]  and lockheed martin and other such things and rathion which uh i don't know if the trump still
[53:40.240 --> 53:46.480]  do but they did at one point but now pence is saying trump is an isolationist yeah don't you
[53:46.480 --> 53:50.000]  know if you don't bomb every country in the middle east into oblivion you're an isolationist
[53:50.000 --> 53:55.600]  dick chaney is such a warmonger
[53:58.240 --> 54:03.600]  you know i think there's a special place in the afterlife for people that promote death and war
[54:03.600 --> 54:10.880]  don't you i do i think there's a special place in hell for people that lie us in the war
[54:10.880 --> 54:20.480]  remember that golf of tonkin incident that lied us into war at vietnam never even happened
[54:21.920 --> 54:28.640]  never even happened weapons of mass destruction in iraq we invaded millions of people died
[54:30.720 --> 54:38.160]  never found them never even had them dick chaney was a part of that you know dick
[54:38.160 --> 54:43.440]  i think it would behoove you to come out and apologize for all your war crimes during the
[54:43.440 --> 54:48.720]  bush era instead of coming out and attacking trump but i guess you've totally committed to
[54:48.720 --> 54:52.560]  evil haven't you dick you've totally committed to war haven't you dick
[54:57.360 --> 55:01.680]  after a week of infighting democrats wonder where to draw the line on speech
[55:01.680 --> 55:09.840]  well let's see the democrats used to fight for jewish people the democrats used to stand
[55:09.840 --> 55:13.440]  with the jewish people because you know they were the ones that were the most mitigated from
[55:13.440 --> 55:17.920]  society they were the ones that most ostracized they were the ones that were the most attacked
[55:17.920 --> 55:22.240]  and ridiculed and and the hatred was all against the jews but you know i guess that's changed now
[55:22.800 --> 55:27.840]  and so the democrats don't care about them now they're embracing uh muslims because of islamophobia
[55:27.840 --> 55:33.760]  and uh you know everybody in america is racist so you know they have to fight for the minorities
[55:34.880 --> 55:42.560]  but they're in a big trouble right now with actual intellectual democrats and liberals
[55:42.560 --> 55:51.600]  and progressives because uh folks the average american that is a democrat is not a socialist
[55:51.600 --> 55:58.160]  the average american that is a democrat uh doesn't want islam in the west
[56:00.080 --> 56:06.160]  and when the democrats can't even decide where they stand on antisemitism
[56:08.160 --> 56:13.920]  in fact there was a video i don't know if i sent it to the crew it was a whole
[56:14.800 --> 56:20.560]  group of holocaust survivors saying they voted democrat their whole life and now they're going
[56:20.560 --> 56:33.120]  to vote trump in 2020 but see the democrats can't figure out where to put their their foot in the
[56:33.120 --> 56:39.520]  water because they have to keep moving first they disavowed the women's march for antisemitism
[56:39.520 --> 56:45.600]  but now they stand with ilhan omar and her antisemitism and then ilhan omar yesterday
[56:45.600 --> 56:53.440]  said trump isn't even human so uh you know that's also what muslims say about the infidels
[56:54.240 --> 56:59.200]  that they're not human the radical muslims say the infidel is not human that's why
[56:59.200 --> 57:06.720]  you're allowed to kill them and lie to them and the radical sect of islam is starting to even
[57:07.280 --> 57:13.600]  do that to heretics that don't want to kill jews don't want to kill the free market in the west
[57:13.600 --> 57:17.840]  and have not been indoctrinated into the seventh century islam
[57:20.640 --> 57:27.440]  but the democrats will have to figure all that out before the 2020 election before they all eat
[57:27.440 --> 57:33.600]  each other's lunch during these presidential debates which is going to be fun to watch but
[57:33.600 --> 57:40.000]  you watch this yang and tulsi gabard by far the best the democrats have to have to offer i i could
[57:40.000 --> 57:43.360]  understand supporting either one of them personally i wouldn't vote for them but i could totally see
[57:43.360 --> 57:47.600]  it and you watch the democrats will throw yang and gabard totally under the bus because they're
[57:47.600 --> 57:51.920]  actually legitimate people well i've got some really good news for all the viewers and all the
[57:51.920 --> 57:55.840]  listeners this was going to be a big loss because we couldn't get the deep earth crystals anymore

[1:01:57.120 --> 1:02:02.880]  to end a war that should have ended long ago the war in afghanistan the united states has been fighting
[1:02:02.880 --> 1:02:10.640]  the war on terror since october of 2001 and it has cost six trillion dollars two thousand three
[1:02:10.640 --> 1:02:16.480]  hundred military members have lost their lives and another 20 000 were wounded in action but we
[1:02:16.480 --> 1:02:23.040]  are many many years past that mission we have turned to a nation building at a cost of over
[1:02:23.040 --> 1:02:29.680]  50 billion dollars a year spent in afghanistan i agree and now i'm pushing forward to end our
[1:02:29.680 --> 1:02:35.920]  long-running war in afghanistan my bill also rewards those who served within one year after
[1:02:35.920 --> 1:02:41.360]  the war ends two thousand five hundred dollar victory bonus will be paid to all members of the
[1:02:41.360 --> 1:02:48.000]  military who served in the global war on terrorism since 2001 more than three million men and women
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:53.600]  have been deployed each of them will get two thousand five hundred dollars this would be a
[1:02:53.600 --> 1:03:00.160]  one-time cost of seven billion dollars and an immediate savings of over 83 percent when compared
[1:03:00.160 --> 1:03:05.920]  to the current yearly cost of nation building so we're spending 50 some odd billion there we're
[1:03:05.920 --> 1:03:11.520]  going to take seven billion of that give bonuses to our soldiers and then what we're going to do is
[1:03:11.520 --> 1:03:16.480]  the rest of it will be a peace dividend and from here on out we'll save about 50 billion dollars a
[1:03:16.480 --> 1:03:23.360]  year why does uncle sam have to be uncle sap and pay for everything the list is ongoing and incredibly
[1:03:23.360 --> 1:03:30.560]  insulting to american taxpayers it's time to declare our mission over and our war one it's
[1:03:30.560 --> 1:03:37.680]  time to build here not there but that's why they want to keep us there because the trillion six
[1:03:38.480 --> 1:03:44.080]  trillion not one trillion not two trillion not three trillion not four trillion not five trillion
[1:03:44.080 --> 1:03:52.320]  six trillion dollars i mean this is ridiculous and in meanwhile china gets all the rare earth
[1:03:52.320 --> 1:03:58.400]  minerals we pay for their security there so they get all the different rare earth minerals to build
[1:03:58.400 --> 1:04:03.360]  all the smartphones and the crap that we buy rare earth elements it's a term used to describe a group
[1:04:03.360 --> 1:04:10.800]  of 17 metals most of which most of us never heard of china mines most of it for the world's technology
[1:04:10.800 --> 1:04:16.800]  industry more than 95 percent the rest has been mined in the united states in estonia in india
[1:04:16.800 --> 1:04:22.880]  in malaysia and in brazil in south america we are doing this as a subsidy to china it has to end
[1:04:29.680 --> 1:04:35.360]  you know and when i go out and i talk to leftists or liberals or progressives like i just did it
[1:04:35.360 --> 1:04:40.480]  south by southwest there's one thing we always agree on stop wars overseas stop spending trillions
[1:04:40.480 --> 1:04:45.120]  of dollars overseas why why doesn't the mainstream media ever get behind that it's a unifying message
[1:04:45.760 --> 1:04:50.240]  it's funny the only the only non-interventionist you find on cable news or tucker carlsson

[1:06:30.320 --> 1:06:39.360]  media matters trying to get tucker carlson kicked off a fox news did tucker carlson say some things
[1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:47.280]  on the radio that uh people might deem offensive or inappropriate he absolutely did big whoop
[1:06:48.640 --> 1:06:53.840]  and so you know that's the big thing that gets me about this is like these people promote the most
[1:06:53.840 --> 1:07:00.640]  disgusting crap i mean slate and all these magazines promote pedophilia it gets promoted
[1:07:00.640 --> 1:07:05.760]  on youtube i mean just look at the disgust that comes out of hollywood and the entertainment
[1:07:05.760 --> 1:07:13.680]  industry i mean it's a joke i mean these people california's entertainment culture just gives us
[1:07:13.680 --> 1:07:24.560]  total filth fake butts fake boobs naked women porn violence death gore i mean it's all they push
[1:07:24.560 --> 1:07:28.160]  and okay fine i mean it's entertaining it's what the people want i'm not even sitting here acting
[1:07:28.160 --> 1:07:33.920]  like i'm above it but then they sit here and they're like look at what tucker carlson said one time
[1:07:36.160 --> 1:07:42.720]  uh what about joy reeds homophobic remarks what about what bill and hillary clinton have
[1:07:42.720 --> 1:07:52.400]  said about black people they never care do they it's all about getting tucker carlson why
[1:07:53.120 --> 1:07:59.920]  because he embarrasses their intellectuals every time they go on his television show
[1:07:59.920 --> 1:08:08.800]  he makes mincemeat out of their quote unquote intellect so they have to remove him see he embarrasses
[1:08:08.800 --> 1:08:15.200]  them and i'm sure they'd also love to remove him because he doesn't want to abort american children
[1:08:15.200 --> 1:08:18.640]  and i'm sure they'd also want to remove him because he doesn't want to fight endless wars
[1:08:18.640 --> 1:08:28.240]  in the middle east but i encourage i actually media matters and the rest of them to continue to
[1:08:28.240 --> 1:08:35.600]  attack tucker carlson and info wars and everyone else because you don't get it yet do you people
[1:08:35.600 --> 1:08:42.640]  are sick of you and when you try to remove someone off air because they did some racy
[1:08:42.640 --> 1:08:50.000]  shock jock interview a decade ago people look at you and think you're the one with the problem
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:56.080]  not tucker carlson and i'm gonna sit here and say that everybody talks like tucker and bubble the
[1:08:56.080 --> 1:09:02.400]  love sponge we're saying or like trump during the billy bush tape but it's like give me a break
[1:09:02.400 --> 1:09:07.920]  people can you imagine what the average leftist that says death to america on the street says
[1:09:07.920 --> 1:09:13.360]  behind closed doors can you imagine what the average leftist that celebrates the fact that she's
[1:09:13.360 --> 1:09:18.480]  aborted three children says behind closed doors i've got all this on tape by the way is why the
[1:09:18.480 --> 1:09:24.400]  band is on youtube is why they banned me on youtube because i've got it all on tape can you imagine
[1:09:24.400 --> 1:09:31.200]  what they sound like behind closed doors can you imagine what they consume entertainment wise
[1:09:31.200 --> 1:09:40.080]  behind closed doors but see it's all about the perpetual pathological projection of the left
[1:09:41.360 --> 1:09:47.120]  see because that's the thing we actually sit here with morals and think wow like i'm really
[1:09:47.120 --> 1:09:52.160]  not that good of a person in god's eyes i wish i could be better they sit here with no morals
[1:09:52.160 --> 1:09:59.360]  total garbage total crap humans and they know they are but see they want to hide it and they want
[1:09:59.360 --> 1:10:04.960]  to act like we're the bad people so they want to act like they're the moral righteous ones so
[1:10:04.960 --> 1:10:11.600]  they stand for open borders because it's morally righteous they stand against trump because it's
[1:10:11.600 --> 1:10:18.880]  morally righteous meanwhile they're the most immoral people immoral people in the world
[1:10:21.120 --> 1:10:26.560]  tucker carlson blast liberal mob after comments on earth they've been working hard to kill this show
[1:10:26.560 --> 1:10:34.000]  now i'm not sitting here saying what tucker said was good or bad but i will say this his response
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:41.120]  last night in the opening segment of his show was perfect here is tucker carlson responding to the
[1:10:41.120 --> 1:10:47.520]  hate mob trying to kick him off fox news why are the people who consider bill clinton a hero
[1:10:47.520 --> 1:10:53.760]  lecturing me about sexism how can the party that demands racial quotas denounce other people as
[1:10:53.760 --> 1:11:00.320]  racist after a while you begin to think that maybe their criticisms aren't sincere maybe their
[1:11:00.320 --> 1:11:06.480]  moral puffery is a costume maybe the whole conversation is an absurd joke maybe we're falling
[1:11:06.480 --> 1:11:12.880]  for it you sometimes hear modern progressives described as new puritans that's a slur on
[1:11:12.880 --> 1:11:17.360]  colonial americans whatever their flaws the puritans cared about the fate of the human
[1:11:17.360 --> 1:11:22.320]  soul and the moral regeneration of their society those are not topics that interest progressives
[1:11:22.320 --> 1:11:27.200]  they're too busy pushing late term abortion and cross dressing on fifth graders these are the people
[1:11:27.200 --> 1:11:32.800]  who write our movies and our sitcoms they are not shocked by naughty words they just pretend to be
[1:11:32.800 --> 1:11:38.640]  when it's useful it's been very useful lately the left's main goal in case you haven't noticed
[1:11:38.640 --> 1:11:43.280]  is controlling what you think in order to do that they have to control the information that you
[1:11:43.280 --> 1:11:48.640]  receive google and facebook and twitter are fully on board with that they're happy to ban unapproved
[1:11:48.640 --> 1:11:52.800]  thoughts and they don't apologize for it they often do so to the other cable channels and
[1:11:52.800 --> 1:11:58.800]  virtually every major news outlet in this country one of the only places left in the united states
[1:11:58.800 --> 1:12:05.920]  where independent thoughts are allowed is right here the opinion hours on this network just a few
[1:12:05.920 --> 1:12:11.120]  hours in a sea of television programming it's not much relatively speaking for the left it's
[1:12:11.120 --> 1:12:16.800]  unacceptable they demand total conformity since the day we went on the air they've been working
[1:12:16.800 --> 1:12:21.840]  hard to kill this show we haven't said much about it in public it seemed too self-referential
[1:12:21.840 --> 1:12:27.040]  the point of this show has never been us but now it's obvious to everybody there's no pretending
[1:12:27.040 --> 1:12:30.880]  that it's not happening it is happening and so going forward we'll be covering their efforts to
[1:12:30.880 --> 1:12:37.120]  make us be quiet for now though just two points to leave you with first fox news is behind us
[1:12:37.120 --> 1:12:42.560]  as they have been since the very first day toughness is a rare quality at a tv network and we are
[1:12:42.560 --> 1:12:47.440]  grateful for that second we've always apologized when we're wrong and we'll continue to do that
[1:12:47.440 --> 1:12:55.120]  that's what decent people do they apologize but we will never bow to the mob ever no matter what
[1:12:57.680 --> 1:13:02.640]  now and you also notice that media matters isn't writing a bunch of hit pieces on bubba the love
[1:13:02.640 --> 1:13:09.280]  sponge or howard stern who make a living off talk like that because they have the right to
[1:13:09.280 --> 1:13:14.560]  do and because they don't deem them as a threat to their political agenda and that
[1:13:15.280 --> 1:13:22.720]  is all you need to know selective censorship because it's not about morals it's not about
[1:13:22.720 --> 1:13:28.960]  righteousness it's not about the content it's about the politics and it's about how effective
[1:13:28.960 --> 1:13:35.280]  tucker carlson is i mean i don't know why they continue to put those leftist liberal progressive
[1:13:35.280 --> 1:13:40.160]  guests on his show i mean it's it's literally just a mincemeat segment every night uh but
[1:13:43.200 --> 1:13:46.800]  we'll see what happens tonight on the tucker carlson show because they've they they
[1:13:46.800 --> 1:13:54.960]  i mean i'll give media matters some credit their iq jumped from like 15 to like 17 last night
[1:13:56.560 --> 1:14:04.080]  and so they learned or they thought they could basically own the situation by releasing some
[1:14:04.080 --> 1:14:10.320]  of the tape and then have tucker go live and then releasing more of the tape like see you can't hide
[1:14:10.320 --> 1:14:16.640]  from this so we'll let's see what happens tonight on tucker carlson my guess is he probably won't
[1:14:16.640 --> 1:14:22.240]  talk about it tonight um but who knows but the censorship doesn't stop there facebook has now
[1:14:22.240 --> 1:14:34.480]  banned zero hedge uh very popular news site zero hedge dot com and facebook has now banned them because
[1:14:34.480 --> 1:14:40.560]  quote they go against facebook's community standards well yeah facebook's community
[1:14:40.560 --> 1:14:46.160]  standards are censorship not free speech facebook's community standards are not america's community
[1:14:46.160 --> 1:14:52.800]  standards it's the nazis community standards facebook backtracks after removing worn ads
[1:14:52.800 --> 1:14:58.640]  calling for facebook breakup so for the first time ever a democrat had to deal with facebook
[1:14:58.640 --> 1:15:04.000]  censorship and immediately facebook said okay fine we're sorry we won't censor you even though
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:12.400]  you're talking trash on us and so even a fake indian can find a tp every once in a while
[1:15:12.400 --> 1:15:18.960]  and lisbeth warren says facebook should be broken up and then she gets banned welcome to the club
[1:15:19.520 --> 1:15:24.880]  eliz zuckerberg wants facebook to build a mind reading machine wow
[1:15:27.760 --> 1:15:30.240]  but hasn't facebook kind of already done that
[1:15:32.800 --> 1:15:39.280]  isn't that what facebook was really all about as they're about to roll out the facial recognition
[1:15:39.280 --> 1:15:44.720]  in the united states of america and they're gonna act like oh we're just rolling this out now for

[1:20:24.480 --> 1:20:44.400]  you'll notice a tactic
[1:20:46.560 --> 1:20:49.440]  a tactical difference that is between
[1:20:49.440 --> 1:20:55.280]  between liberals and conservatives and that's really just the terms i'm using
[1:20:56.640 --> 1:21:03.520]  because it's just kind of the modern day parlance if you will but we're about to go to the buzzfeed
[1:21:03.520 --> 1:21:08.960]  ceo complaining about big tech having a problem controlling content well it doesn't really seem
[1:21:08.960 --> 1:21:12.400]  like they have a problem they're erasing everybody that's pro america off their platform so i don't
[1:21:12.400 --> 1:21:18.880]  know what the problem is but see here's the tactical difference when i see or hear from somebody
[1:21:18.880 --> 1:21:24.960]  that has a different political view and stance than i i stick a mic in their face
[1:21:25.920 --> 1:21:31.280]  i want to give them a platform i want them to talk i want to talk to them but you notice how
[1:21:31.280 --> 1:21:35.840]  the left is totally different they don't want to talk to us they don't want us to have a voice
[1:21:35.840 --> 1:21:39.680]  they don't want anyone to hear from us and doesn't that tell you everything you need to know about
[1:21:39.680 --> 1:21:45.040]  these people they're so weak and pathetic that they know they can't win in an intellectual debate
[1:21:45.040 --> 1:21:52.400]  so they just erase the rest of us off of social media here's the ceo of buzzfeed complaining about
[1:21:53.520 --> 1:21:59.360]  conservatives existing on social media and we never had access to more information but it's
[1:21:59.360 --> 1:22:05.680]  harder and harder to figure out what's true and um we never needed truths more um and so what's
[1:22:05.680 --> 1:22:10.320]  happened in the last year is that the crisis that started in digital media has spread to the tech
[1:22:10.320 --> 1:22:17.040]  platforms now pause it real quick says we've never needed truth more so obviously he's talking about
[1:22:17.040 --> 1:22:24.000]  like msn bc and cnn and washington post new york times with the covington catholic host uh hoax
[1:22:24.000 --> 1:22:30.640]  the jesse smallett hoax the hoax that trump is a racist bigot the cavernal hoax surely that's what
[1:22:30.640 --> 1:22:34.080]  he's talking about right because those are the ones that he wants banned right so uh since the
[1:22:34.080 --> 1:22:40.560]  truth is so important clearly the ceo of buzzfeed is talking about the massive whoppers of lies that
[1:22:40.560 --> 1:22:47.280]  people like don lemont try to tell you every night at cnn but let's go back a year to go the tech
[1:22:47.280 --> 1:22:53.040]  platform seemed all powerful it seemed like they were never going to have a crisis they were printing
[1:22:53.040 --> 1:23:00.800]  money they were growing they were hiring um and their business is still strong but they're having
[1:23:00.800 --> 1:23:07.680]  huge problems with the content that lives on their platforms um anti-vaxxers pedophile right there
[1:23:09.760 --> 1:23:17.040]  another whopper of a lie anti-vaxxers kind of like anti-immigration they say we're anti-immigration
[1:23:17.040 --> 1:23:26.000]  no we're pro-immigration they say anti-vaxxers i'm not anti-vaxxer go get a vaccine the science
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:32.160]  behind vaccines is real absolutely no one's saying that you should never get a vaccine
[1:23:32.160 --> 1:23:38.960]  i just want choice i just want informed consent i just want to read the insert that's not anti-vaxing
[1:23:38.960 --> 1:23:45.280]  you lying piece of crap i mean i i'm trying not to yell i'm trying not to get upset but the
[1:23:45.280 --> 1:23:50.400]  ceo of buzzfeed stands up here and says the truth matters and then lies to you through his teeth
[1:23:50.400 --> 1:24:01.040]  why are these people such scumbags man go back um but uh people just making things up and posting
[1:24:01.040 --> 1:24:05.200]  fake news saying the pope endorsed trump and things that are positive again positive again
[1:24:05.200 --> 1:24:11.120]  literally everything buzzfeed does they just may crap up trumps are racist trumps this trumps that
[1:24:11.120 --> 1:24:17.280]  trump remove the martin luther king bust i mean you people fake everything you freaking do man
[1:24:17.280 --> 1:24:27.200]  who are these people go back to the clip um the the platforms don't make content and they're having
[1:24:27.200 --> 1:24:32.240]  trouble controlling the content that reaches the public and they reach billions of people
[1:24:32.240 --> 1:24:37.600]  and so this has become a real crisis for the platforms to the point where uh today elizabeth
[1:24:37.600 --> 1:24:42.880]  warren was saying she wants to break up the platforms as part of her political um um platform
[1:24:42.880 --> 1:24:48.800]  so there's a real sense of crisis in yes you got sense for that the way consumers interact with
[1:24:48.800 --> 1:24:53.920]  their services is through content and they have very little control over that content and they
[1:24:53.920 --> 1:25:00.400]  and they have are having a lot of trouble maintaining the integrity of that content um so
[1:25:00.400 --> 1:25:05.120]  there's an obvious pause it real quick pause real quick what what what notice how he hasn't actually
[1:25:05.120 --> 1:25:13.440]  given you any like solid reference to anything folks it go ahead and try to rebroadcast today's
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:20.080]  alex joneshow on facebook on twitter on youtube you will be shut down within minutes
[1:25:24.240 --> 1:25:29.040]  just go back to them digital media companies you know what here's something to do pause it real
[1:25:29.040 --> 1:25:33.120]  quick because this is like a common thread that i don't know if this is annoying to the audience
[1:25:33.120 --> 1:25:40.640]  but like who are these people like who is this jonah paredi that is just such either an ignoramus
[1:25:40.640 --> 1:25:45.280]  or a liar but you know what i'm done asking i'm done asking i'm done asking who these people are
[1:25:45.280 --> 1:25:54.240]  they're satan jonah paredi is the devil whether he consciously knows it or not he's the devil so
[1:25:54.240 --> 1:26:00.960]  so let's go back to the uh ceo of buzzfeed uh satan himself but they make tons of great content
[1:26:00.960 --> 1:26:05.840]  and tech platforms have tons of revenue tons of profit but they're having a lot of problems with
[1:26:06.400 --> 1:26:11.280]  the um with the content that lives on their platform and so there's an obvious solution of
[1:26:11.280 --> 1:26:16.160]  the tech platforms and digital media companies working together and working together to solve
[1:26:16.160 --> 1:26:20.000]  these problems for society and you mean the democrats problems in their respective industries
[1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:24.960]  and businesses no no no no pause right there you mean you mean uh satan you mean the democrats
[1:26:24.960 --> 1:26:30.160]  right i mean it's the democrats that prepared jerry nadler statement it's the democrats getting
[1:26:30.160 --> 1:26:34.240]  money from google and and plant parenthood and all this stuff and it's the democrats calling for
[1:26:34.240 --> 1:26:39.440]  censorship so so this guy the devil's talking about the democrats right i mean obviously
[1:26:39.440 --> 1:26:43.280]  that's what satan's talking about here all right go back to satan we can work together to fix the
[1:26:43.280 --> 1:26:51.520]  internet and and i think that the good news is that we are um we're we're starting to make progress
[1:26:51.520 --> 1:26:56.240]  on this but one thing that is important to make progress is we can't just police bad content if
[1:26:56.240 --> 1:27:02.480]  you think about um the tens of thousands of moderators anti-police companies like facebook
[1:27:02.480 --> 1:27:08.480]  and youtube are hiring um they're trying to get rid of all the bad stuff and it's an endless fight
[1:27:08.480 --> 1:27:12.720]  to get rid of all the terrible content that's uploaded these platforms and they can never win
[1:27:12.720 --> 1:27:18.400]  this what content there's a vacuum of which is created by a lack of good content and it's made
[1:27:18.400 --> 1:27:24.800]  it difficult for what content for um the plaza real quick what content you notice how he gives no
[1:27:24.800 --> 1:27:31.200]  references no examples now what he'd like to say is i don't like it when i get on social media and i
[1:27:31.200 --> 1:27:36.640]  see info wars i don't like it when i get on social media and i see tucker carlson i don't like it when
[1:27:36.640 --> 1:27:41.360]  i go on social media and i see people that want to warn you about vaccines i don't like it when
[1:27:41.360 --> 1:27:48.160]  i go on social media and there's people that are pro-life boy sounds like the devil doesn't it but
[1:27:48.160 --> 1:27:54.000]  see the devil is very disciplined in its deception so he doesn't give you the examples because he
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:28:01.440]  doesn't want to fully expose himself as the devil so he works in vagueness and ambiguity to keep you
[1:28:01.440 --> 1:28:06.720]  thinking oh he's a good guy he cares about me no it's the devil let's go back to the devil
[1:28:07.280 --> 1:28:12.640]  opportunity for all these other bad actors to upload content who what bad actors much easier
[1:28:13.360 --> 1:28:18.400]  to actually create an ecosystem where good content can thrive if you do that there's less room for bad
[1:28:18.400 --> 1:28:24.560]  content there's less room for bad actors who and you actually have more ability to buzzfeed connect
[1:28:24.560 --> 1:28:33.520]  with your audience and give them things that they really like buzzfeed published the fake russian

[1:35:08.080 --> 1:35:12.560]  leo zagami is going to be joining us shortly we are getting connected with him the latest
[1:35:12.560 --> 1:35:20.000]  story that he has yellow vests finally attack masonic lodge of the gof involved in a political
[1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:27.920]  conspiracy against the french people so we will be getting leo zagami's breakdown of
[1:35:27.920 --> 1:35:32.800]  that story from leo zagami dot com where he's always doing great work you know i want to
[1:35:32.800 --> 1:35:37.440]  talk to him about something too because he understands this as well as anybody but
[1:35:40.240 --> 1:35:45.520]  you know this isn't like some sort of like power trip or anything honestly it's humbling
[1:35:45.520 --> 1:35:52.560]  but it's like i couldn't do any of this without god's help i would be totally lost i'd be a lost soul
[1:35:54.080 --> 1:36:00.720]  and i'd probably still be brainwashed if it wasn't for god's divine intervention in my life
[1:36:01.440 --> 1:36:05.440]  sometimes you have to learn things the hard way sometimes god has to kind of twist your arm give
[1:36:05.440 --> 1:36:10.560]  you a little arm bar before you tap out and realize what the world is really about but
[1:36:10.560 --> 1:36:15.600]  leo zagami knows about that so i'd like to talk to him about that too but by the way
[1:36:16.480 --> 1:36:19.680]  as we're getting leo connected and alex jones is going to be joining us in the next hour
[1:36:23.040 --> 1:36:27.760]  stories coming out of venezuela they're having power grid shuts that shut downs the lights are
[1:36:27.760 --> 1:36:33.520]  going out hospitals are losing power people are dying because of it the internet keeps going out
[1:36:33.520 --> 1:36:40.480]  and then uh the story is in the mitt press and i'm i'm seeing others suggest this did the u.s
[1:36:40.480 --> 1:36:46.960]  recycle a bush era plan to take out venezuela's power grid now i don't know what the bush era plan
[1:36:46.960 --> 1:36:55.680]  is uh with this but i do believe it was in 2012 when we the story goes it was either the nsa or
[1:36:55.680 --> 1:37:04.000]  i forget who it was shut down serious power grid and i was reading stories about that last night um
[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:08.080]  let me just comb through this real quick to see exactly what years they're talked about they're
[1:37:08.080 --> 1:37:15.680]  saying uh the bush administration did it or tried to do it too i ran a little tougher to do it too
[1:37:15.680 --> 1:37:27.040]  i ran their allies with russia but you know i john bolton of course john bolton is always around
[1:37:27.040 --> 1:37:34.640]  for all this stuff you know the war mustache but and then you had elliott abram is basically admit
[1:37:34.640 --> 1:37:43.200]  well you know we just want to scare them into regime change i say just let venezuela be i
[1:37:43.200 --> 1:37:47.680]  just just stop with foreign intervention you know our own damn country is so messed up man
[1:37:49.920 --> 1:37:53.440]  there's a socialist hellhole in california in case you haven't noticed
[1:37:56.240 --> 1:38:02.720]  so you know how about regime change in california how about regime change in new york
[1:38:02.720 --> 1:38:13.920]  oh my god but uh i really hope that that's not the case wouldn't put it past us though
[1:38:15.120 --> 1:38:19.280]  would not put it past us one bit
[1:38:24.160 --> 1:38:27.440]  you know speaking of regime change in new york

[1:42:19.720 --> 1:42:25.320]  Yeah, I've probably done over
[1:42:27.160 --> 1:42:33.920]  303 hour broadcasts in my life that was an hour long event. She had it South by Southwest
[1:42:33.920 --> 1:42:37.520]  I guarantee you you could not you could not even in the
[1:42:37.960 --> 1:42:42.480]  303 hour broadcasts that I've done in my life probably more than that
[1:42:43.560 --> 1:42:45.560]  You could not compile a
[1:42:45.560 --> 1:42:52.200]  Video of me sounding like that from thousands of hours of me live on air without a teleprompter
[1:42:52.400 --> 1:42:55.800]  She does one speech in South by Southwest. She sounds like an idiot

[1:44:01.240 --> 1:44:09.760]  Censorship and I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored the most buried the most suppressed
[1:44:09.760 --> 1:44:16.680]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant
[1:44:17.000 --> 1:44:22.000]  Leftist authoritarians like the young turds and others get so butt-hurt when Trump won
[1:44:22.960 --> 1:44:27.920]  They don't want us to have that victory. They don't want us to remember what political action did

[1:47:57.480 --> 1:48:00.560]  latest story at Leo Zagami dot com
[1:48:02.080 --> 1:48:09.960]  Yellow vests finally attack Masonic Lodge of the GOF involved in a political conspiracy against the French people
[1:48:10.520 --> 1:48:12.520]  now Leo the
[1:48:12.520 --> 1:48:18.880]  Yellow vests protests have been going on for a couple months now. The media is trying to act like they've died down
[1:48:19.440 --> 1:48:21.440]  Your story would indicate the opposite
[1:48:22.960 --> 1:48:28.200]  So what's going on with these yellow vests and what happened at the Masonic Lodge Leo Zagami?
[1:48:29.680 --> 1:48:34.640]  Hello, everybody. Well, what happened they destroyed the Masonic temple
[1:48:34.640 --> 1:48:42.040]  It was 400 people strong mob that was incited by somebody of course not
[1:48:42.800 --> 1:48:47.640]  Identifiable so we don't really know who was the guy who incited this act
[1:48:47.640 --> 1:48:51.520]  But in the end it wasn't against a regular Lodge
[1:48:51.520 --> 1:48:56.240]  It was against a lodge a temple that holds a number of lodges
[1:48:56.840 --> 1:49:02.560]  Under the Grand Orient of France now the difference between the Grand Orient of France and regular Freemasonry
[1:49:02.560 --> 1:49:05.680]  Is that they actually involve themselves in politics?
[1:49:05.680 --> 1:49:12.680]  And they have given their open support for many years to Emmanuel Macron since he was already minister of economy
[1:49:12.680 --> 1:49:16.960]  So this is not like the Freemasonry we have in the United States
[1:49:17.280 --> 1:49:24.840]  Where politics and religion is forbidden. This is a very different form of Freemasonry that is schismatic
[1:49:24.840 --> 1:49:33.240]  It started in 1877 when the Grand Orient of France broke from the regular network of Masonic lodges
[1:49:33.240 --> 1:49:38.720]  Opening the possibility for atheists for non-believers to join Freemasonry
[1:49:38.720 --> 1:49:45.200]  In fact, they function as cradle for what become later on the Grand Orient of the Russian people
[1:49:45.200 --> 1:49:48.320]  That took over what became later on the Soviet Union
[1:49:48.320 --> 1:49:55.920]  So they became this playground for all the progressive liberal minded people
[1:49:55.920 --> 1:50:03.920]  That later on established worldwide this alternative network of Freemasonry known as liberal Freemasonry
[1:50:03.920 --> 1:50:08.120]  Which is the one that is pushing all this progressive politics
[1:50:08.120 --> 1:50:11.120]  All these left-wing and populist issues
[1:50:11.120 --> 1:50:15.120]  So in a way the Yellow Vests of course have done a criminal act
[1:50:15.120 --> 1:50:17.920]  Because it's not good to destroy anything
[1:50:17.920 --> 1:50:22.920]  But in this case they were actually destroying a base of the enemy
[1:50:22.920 --> 1:50:27.920]  Because this enemy is being conspiring actively against the French people
[1:50:27.920 --> 1:50:32.120]  Against the sovereignty together with Emmanuel Macron
[1:50:32.120 --> 1:50:36.120]  And I have shown this on my website with a couple of documents
[1:50:36.120 --> 1:50:45.320]  One of them is from 2016 in which Emmanuel Macron spoke at the Grand Orient of France main temple
[1:50:45.320 --> 1:50:50.720]  About mondialization as a synonym of progress
[1:50:50.720 --> 1:50:55.720]  So this is an open endorsement of mondialism by the Grand Orient of France
[1:50:55.720 --> 1:50:58.320]  So no wonder they get in trouble
[1:50:58.320 --> 1:51:05.320]  So we have to really start warning all those Freemasons in the US
[1:51:05.320 --> 1:51:10.120]  And I know many of them were starting to collaborate with the Grand Orient of France
[1:51:10.120 --> 1:51:13.320]  Because of their Masonic knowledge of their archives and so on
[1:51:13.320 --> 1:51:21.320]  Because it's dangerous to collaborate with people who are actively conspiring against their own country
[1:51:21.320 --> 1:51:23.320]  This is what I say
[1:51:23.320 --> 1:51:26.320]  Plus the Grand Orient of France in 2015
[1:51:26.320 --> 1:51:30.320]  You remember when there was the massive influx of immigrants arriving
[1:51:30.320 --> 1:51:34.320]  With the Syrian refugees, a million of them in Germany and so on
[1:51:34.320 --> 1:51:38.320]  And the whole of Europe was flooded more than ever
[1:51:38.320 --> 1:51:44.320]  At that point the Grand Orient of France and all the various obedience that worked with the Grand Orient of France
[1:51:44.320 --> 1:51:49.320]  So the Grand Lodge of France, the Federation of France and the Druid of Man and many others
[1:51:49.320 --> 1:51:54.320]  Joined in an official declaration that we should be welcoming of these immigrants
[1:51:54.320 --> 1:51:59.320]  No matter if later on we end up with terrorist attacks and great problems
[1:51:59.320 --> 1:52:07.320]  And ghettos in cities in Europe that are looking more and more like, I don't know, like Beirut
[1:52:07.320 --> 1:52:10.320]  And they are implementing the Sharia
[1:52:10.320 --> 1:52:15.320]  So the big problem here is also that they are accusing of antisemitism the Yellow West
[1:52:15.320 --> 1:52:22.320]  And this is of course something that has been also manipulated by CNN and so on last month
[1:52:22.320 --> 1:52:26.320]  Because the real problem here as you know is not the Yellow West
[1:52:26.320 --> 1:52:28.320]  The problem is Islam
[1:52:28.320 --> 1:52:34.320]  Islam that is flooding, is invading Europe and the West
[1:52:34.320 --> 1:52:36.320]  And of course they are antisemitic
[1:52:36.320 --> 1:52:40.320]  We have seen what is happening in US politics
[1:52:40.320 --> 1:52:43.320]  The same is happening also in Europe
[1:52:43.320 --> 1:52:48.320]  And a long time before the Yellow West even appeared in the picture
[1:52:48.320 --> 1:52:55.320]  A lot of Jewish people, about 4-5 million of them have decided to go back to Israel
[1:52:55.320 --> 1:53:00.320]  Or to go to Israel because they feel persecuted here in Europe
[1:53:00.320 --> 1:53:05.320]  Because this growing Muslim population is indeed antisemitic
[1:53:05.320 --> 1:53:07.320]  And we have to be honest with this
[1:53:07.320 --> 1:53:10.320]  I mean this problem needs to be addressed before it's too late
[1:53:10.320 --> 1:53:14.320]  Well and Leo, I'm just curious because I didn't even hear about this
[1:53:14.320 --> 1:53:19.320]  If it wasn't for leozagami.com, I wouldn't even be hearing about this
[1:53:19.320 --> 1:53:25.320]  And in fact, I was kind of of the notion that the Yellow West protests were starting to die down
[1:53:25.320 --> 1:53:31.320]  But that's just, you know, everybody kind of falls victim to the media control over information
[1:53:31.320 --> 1:53:35.320]  So it would indicate to me that it hasn't died down
[1:53:35.320 --> 1:53:39.320]  And maybe while the numbers are dying down, it seems like they're getting more focused
[1:53:39.320 --> 1:53:42.320]  Again, I'm not supporting destruction of property or anything
[1:53:42.320 --> 1:53:45.320]  But this is in France and they're trying to take their country back
[1:53:45.320 --> 1:53:51.320]  And it seems to me for all intensive purposes, Leo, that Emmanuel Macron is nowhere to be found
[1:53:51.320 --> 1:53:55.320]  He's basically hiding in the storm shelter through all of this
[1:53:55.320 --> 1:53:58.320]  And I guess he thinks that he just hides out, he can last
[1:53:58.320 --> 1:54:01.320]  I mean, what do you think is going through Macron's mind?
[1:54:01.320 --> 1:54:06.320]  Because France is really, I mean, the protests continue
[1:54:06.320 --> 1:54:10.320]  France, I mean, they have a salary cap, you can't make more than X amount a year
[1:54:10.320 --> 1:54:16.320]  So I mean, France is trying to revolutionize itself and get more free market, have a border, have culture
[1:54:16.320 --> 1:54:21.320]  And Macron, the elected leader, is just hiding in a hole
[1:54:21.320 --> 1:54:24.320]  He's hiding but he's still very powerful
[1:54:24.320 --> 1:54:30.320]  I remember that Macron's president of France has even an office in the Vatican
[1:54:30.320 --> 1:54:33.320]  He's totally linked with Pope Francis
[1:54:33.320 --> 1:54:40.320]  I mean, they're not managing to get out of the picture Maduro, who is, of course, protected by Pope Francis
[1:54:40.320 --> 1:54:45.320]  They will never take out of the picture Macron, who is also protected by Pope Francis
[1:54:45.320 --> 1:54:51.320]  That's why there is this link between the Grand Orient of France form of liberal freemasonry
[1:54:51.320 --> 1:54:55.320]  And the Pope and this link was made back in the Second Vatican Council
[1:54:55.320 --> 1:55:02.320]  When, at the time of the Second Vatican Council, these liberal freemasons infiltrated the council
[1:55:02.320 --> 1:55:08.320]  And together with a number of KGB agents ruined basically the Catholic Church
[1:55:08.320 --> 1:55:12.320]  Because the Catholic Church has been infiltrated by these progressive forces
[1:55:12.320 --> 1:55:18.320]  That eventually created all the problems that we are living nowadays
[1:55:18.320 --> 1:55:22.320]  And we are seeing every day in the Catholic Church
[1:55:22.320 --> 1:55:28.320]  So they're now kind of, the yellow vests are going after the banks and their establishments
[1:55:28.320 --> 1:55:32.320]  Their physical establishments, the Masonic physical establishments
[1:55:32.320 --> 1:55:36.320]  And I think that's because, again, the people of France that have been protesting are saying, look
[1:55:36.320 --> 1:55:42.320]  They don't want to destroy property, they don't want to destroy other people's property and private businesses and stuff like that
[1:55:42.320 --> 1:55:44.320]  So they're trying to go after levers of power
[1:55:44.320 --> 1:55:49.320]  I would imagine in hopes to get a response from the leader
[1:55:49.320 --> 1:55:54.320]  The problem here is with the yellow vests, I mean, I have been very close to some of them
[1:55:54.320 --> 1:55:59.320]  And I have direct links with some of them, so I am able to judge what's happening
[1:55:59.320 --> 1:56:05.320]  And I can tell you that there is a lot of confusion because they don't have national leaders that can take on themselves
[1:56:05.320 --> 1:56:09.320]  The responsibility of guiding a movement
[1:56:09.320 --> 1:56:16.320]  The absence of leaders has been made because every time they try to create a leader
[1:56:16.320 --> 1:56:21.320]  The French government will immediately arrest them or stop them or persecute them
[1:56:21.320 --> 1:56:26.320]  So they would like to stay in this kind of liquid form as a movement
[1:56:26.320 --> 1:56:31.320]  But unfortunately, when you don't have a leader, it's very difficult, especially in a place like France
[1:56:31.320 --> 1:56:36.320]  Remember, France is a place for revolution, is the place that created the big revolution
[1:56:36.320 --> 1:56:41.320]  And of course, it's also the place that later on gave in to a little man called Napoleon
[1:56:41.320 --> 1:56:44.320]  So, I mean, Macron is trying
[1:56:44.320 --> 1:56:49.320]  Don't call Napoleon a little man, he might crawl out of his grave and come kind of try to choke you
[1:56:49.320 --> 1:56:55.320]  Okay, but seriously, Leo, I mean, actually this is a good point that you raise here
[1:56:55.320 --> 1:57:00.320]  There isn't really a figurehead or a leader of the yellow vest movement, it seems like
[1:57:00.320 --> 1:57:05.320]  It just seems to be a bunch of people in the streets looking for some change
[1:57:05.320 --> 1:57:10.320]  Yeah, and unfortunately, there is a lot of foreign intelligence operatives
[1:57:10.320 --> 1:57:17.320]  Both from Russia and the U.S. who are trying to, you know, getting involved in all this
[1:57:17.320 --> 1:57:20.320]  That's just like what was going on in Ukraine a couple years ago
[1:57:20.320 --> 1:57:23.320]  And they kept finding all of these infiltrators and they were shooting people
[1:57:23.320 --> 1:57:26.320]  Alright, Leo, we gotta go to a break, stick with us here
[1:57:26.320 --> 1:57:30.320]  We're gonna go to a break, Leo Zagami, leozagami.com is with us

[2:00:40.320 --> 2:00:44.320]  In the new Disney Aladdin movie
[2:00:44.320 --> 2:00:47.320]  So I'm not sure if Leo is interested in that or not
[2:00:47.320 --> 2:00:51.320]  But that has now been suggested
[2:00:51.320 --> 2:00:55.320]  And we also have a story that he wants to cover now
[2:00:55.320 --> 2:00:59.320]  Ukraine Blacklist Kroner Albano as Secured Riz
[2:00:59.320 --> 2:01:03.320]  First of all, I didn't know that there were any Kroner still out there making music
[2:01:03.320 --> 2:01:12.320]  Oh well, Albano Garisi is more than a Kroner. In Russia, he's one of the biggest idols you can ever imagine
[2:01:12.320 --> 2:01:15.320]  I mean, you can compare Michael Jackson to Albano
[2:01:15.320 --> 2:01:18.320]  In fact, actually, Albano sued Michael Jackson
[2:01:18.320 --> 2:01:22.320]  And nearly one Michael Jackson was forced to come to Rome in court
[2:01:22.320 --> 2:01:24.320]  In the middle of the 90s
[2:01:24.320 --> 2:01:29.320]  I covered the whole thing at the time I was a journalist for a different kind of publication
[2:01:29.320 --> 2:01:32.320]  Left in publication called Larry Publica
[2:01:32.320 --> 2:01:34.320]  And I covered the whole thing
[2:01:34.320 --> 2:01:38.320]  And actually Albano was surprised he was not even in Italy when Michael Jackson arrived
[2:01:38.320 --> 2:01:43.320]  Because he didn't expect Michael to turn in person for the court trial against him
[2:01:43.320 --> 2:01:50.320]  So Albano Garisi now has been blacklisted by the Ukrainian government as a national fray
[2:01:50.320 --> 2:01:55.320]  Now this is a very delicate situation because you have to understand this is not just a singer
[2:01:55.320 --> 2:01:58.320]  Albano is one of the best friends of Vladimir Putin
[2:01:58.320 --> 2:02:02.320]  And Albano is not only one of the best friends of Vladimir Putin
[2:02:02.320 --> 2:02:07.320]  But he's one of the best friends of many kernels and generals in the Russian intelligence
[2:02:07.320 --> 2:02:13.320]  So this might trigger a real problem because I mean, Albano apparently is very upset
[2:02:13.320 --> 2:02:17.320]  I saw him yesterday on TV here in Italy and stuff, he's really upset
[2:02:17.320 --> 2:02:23.320]  And I can tell you one thing, you don't want to make Albano upset
[2:02:23.320 --> 2:02:25.320]  I want to say more
[2:02:25.320 --> 2:02:28.320]  So he's kind of, I mean, so he kind of just kind of
[2:02:28.320 --> 2:02:30.320]  He's a sort of a dog
[2:02:30.320 --> 2:02:36.320]  But as a cultural thing though Leo, I mean he really kind of, it sounds like, I'd never heard of him until now
[2:02:36.320 --> 2:02:40.320]  It sounds like he had kind of the Frank Sinatra appeal
[2:02:40.320 --> 2:02:44.320]  Where he was kind of bigger than his music, but Frank Sinatra, he used to hang out with presidents
[2:02:44.320 --> 2:02:46.320]  He hang out with all the stars
[2:02:46.320 --> 2:02:50.320]  I mean Frank Sinatra was one of the most popular people in America, he hung out with everyone
[2:02:50.320 --> 2:02:58.320]  He met Albano Carisi, he met him in 1986 when he was still the head of the KGB
[2:02:58.320 --> 2:03:02.320]  I mean here we are talking about a guy, I was also in Russia at that time
[2:03:02.320 --> 2:03:10.320]  I participated in 2002 to a very big event that was organized at the Bolshoi
[2:03:10.320 --> 2:03:12.320]  For the children victims of terrorism
[2:03:12.320 --> 2:03:18.320]  And I spent many years working also in Russia at the time
[2:03:18.320 --> 2:03:20.320]  He was one of the biggest artists
[2:03:20.320 --> 2:03:23.320]  I arrived there as a record producer, as a DJ
[2:03:23.320 --> 2:03:31.320]  So what's behind this, why does Ukraine want Albano banned and blacklisted?
[2:03:31.320 --> 2:03:38.320]  Well, they want because Albano apparently is too close to Putin
[2:03:38.320 --> 2:03:43.320]  And he's now even saying on TV, no, I'm not that close to Putin
[2:03:43.320 --> 2:03:45.320]  Why do you have to ban me?
[2:03:45.320 --> 2:03:51.320]  But there is some kind of intelligence interest here in wanting Albano out of the picture
[2:03:51.320 --> 2:03:57.320]  Because Ukraine is a very delicate political situation at the moment, very frail
[2:03:57.320 --> 2:04:01.320]  So they are afraid that, you know, even an artist of his caliber
[2:04:01.320 --> 2:04:06.320]  That can be used by Putin in some way to influence Russian politics
[2:04:06.320 --> 2:04:11.320]  I mean, I know it's crazy, but he is being put and blacklisted as a national threat
[2:04:11.320 --> 2:04:15.320]  So this is the news that today I'm also bringing here
[2:04:15.320 --> 2:04:20.320]  So now if you have any sort of celebrity power
[2:04:20.320 --> 2:04:24.320]  And so we can kind of tie this into the American celebrity politics
[2:04:24.320 --> 2:04:28.320]  Where it's like, if you're a conservative or you like Trump or you like America
[2:04:28.320 --> 2:04:32.320]  Just shut the hell up or you're going to be blacklisted from Hollywood
[2:04:32.320 --> 2:04:36.320]  It's kind of the same thing, so it's like the same thing is going on over across the world
[2:04:36.320 --> 2:04:40.320]  Well, absolutely, because Albano praised Vladimir Putin
[2:04:40.320 --> 2:04:43.320]  And of course, once you praise Vladimir Putin, that's it
[2:04:43.320 --> 2:04:48.320]  Yeah, and I'm sure that, you know, once you praise Putin or Trump, you lose all your talent too
[2:04:48.320 --> 2:04:50.320]  And that's why they don't want you on the scene
[2:04:50.320 --> 2:05:13.320]  Oh wait, no, it's because of the politics, not about the music
[2:05:20.320 --> 2:05:23.320]  It's sold a lot, but people want original X2
[2:05:23.320 --> 2:05:27.320]  I was resigned the fact we didn't have X2, but it came through about a month ago
[2:05:27.320 --> 2:05:31.320]  We now have X2 again at m4store.com, so hallelujah
[2:05:31.320 --> 2:05:33.320]  It's been sold out for about almost three months
[2:05:33.320 --> 2:05:38.320]  But we have now had the same company, the original X2
[2:05:38.320 --> 2:05:43.320]  Develop it again, and we were able to do the exact same formula
[2:05:43.320 --> 2:05:46.320]  We want to pre-order X2, the ultimate iodine out there

[2:05:50.320 --> 2:05:52.320]  Learn about how the other iodines are bound

[2:06:17.320 --> 2:06:23.320]  You know, not to get distracted here with the guests Leo Zagami that we have on air
[2:06:23.320 --> 2:06:29.320]  And I want to talk about something a little, let's just say higher consciousness with him now
[2:06:29.320 --> 2:06:32.320]  But I can tie this into it
[2:06:32.320 --> 2:06:36.320]  So there's this story, and I've never really bothered to look into it
[2:06:36.320 --> 2:06:40.320]  Until just here in the last couple minutes
[2:06:40.320 --> 2:06:43.320]  This big college scam story that's going around
[2:06:43.320 --> 2:06:46.320]  I just figured it was some kind of low level, you know, typical college scam
[2:06:46.320 --> 2:06:48.320]  And people are always cheating the system
[2:06:48.320 --> 2:06:50.320]  I couldn't believe the names involved in this
[2:06:50.320 --> 2:06:54.320]  Top actresses, I mean household names
[2:06:54.320 --> 2:06:57.320]  Just rigging the whole college system basically
[2:06:57.320 --> 2:07:03.320]  But here's my point, because it's really just a microcosm of the college system in general
[2:07:03.320 --> 2:07:08.320]  The whole higher education system in America, the whole college system in America is all rigged
[2:07:08.320 --> 2:07:11.320]  It's all fake, it's all bull crap
[2:07:11.320 --> 2:07:16.320]  Just look at the NCAA folks, I mean the NCAA has got to be one of the most corrupt organizations in America
[2:07:16.320 --> 2:07:20.320]  They basically get free labor, I mean you could call it slave labor if you wanted
[2:07:20.320 --> 2:07:23.320]  But they get free labor off the backs of these student athletes
[2:07:23.320 --> 2:07:27.320]  Oh, we give them an education, they're students first, no they're not
[2:07:27.320 --> 2:07:32.320]  Anybody who's been around college campus and new college athletes specifically at division one schools
[2:07:32.320 --> 2:07:36.320]  Know that they're athletes first, they're athletes second, they're athletes third
[2:07:36.320 --> 2:07:41.320]  And then if they choose to with any free time they may or may not have left if they want to study and get good grades
[2:07:41.320 --> 2:07:44.320]  They can do that, but then most of their grades are rigged for them anyway
[2:07:44.320 --> 2:07:48.320]  Again, I've been around college athletes, I hung around them, I saw the benefits
[2:07:48.320 --> 2:07:52.320]  I don't need to get into it, they throw underage drinking parties for high school recruits
[2:07:52.320 --> 2:07:55.320]  They have local car dealerships, give them all new cars
[2:07:55.320 --> 2:08:00.320]  Some of them just get straight cash payouts, they give them homes, I mean folks, it's a joke
[2:08:00.320 --> 2:08:05.320]  Look at what they had at North Carolina, literally fake classes that they had the basketball team signed up with
[2:08:05.320 --> 2:08:09.320]  I remember Derrick Rose when he got to Memphis, they fabricated his SAT scores
[2:08:09.320 --> 2:08:13.320]  But let me tie it into what I wanted to get into with Leo
[2:08:13.320 --> 2:08:20.320]  You know, you should be able to see how corrupt the college system is in America
[2:08:20.320 --> 2:08:24.320]  Without even knowing all of that stuff, but only if you're connected to God
[2:08:24.320 --> 2:08:26.320]  And only if you have his vision
[2:08:26.320 --> 2:08:32.320]  Now Leo, you've seen a lot of the devil's work at hand, you've been covering it
[2:08:32.320 --> 2:08:35.320]  You've written books about it
[2:08:35.320 --> 2:08:40.320]  And I've just realized here, honestly, just in the last like 48 hours, it's really hit me how
[2:08:40.320 --> 2:08:45.320]  If you're not connected to God, if you don't ask for his vision and his discernment
[2:08:45.320 --> 2:08:52.320]  The world has been so rigged and censored and twisted, yes by humans, but really by Satan
[2:08:52.320 --> 2:08:56.320]  That you can't even really see the world anymore
[2:08:56.320 --> 2:09:00.320]  The world has been so, I mean the veil has been put over our eyes by Satan
[2:09:00.320 --> 2:09:04.320]  That unless you have God's vision, you can't even see all the deception that's going on
[2:09:04.320 --> 2:09:08.320]  So for most people, they probably see this story of all the college rig and everything like
[2:09:08.320 --> 2:09:12.320]  Oh my gosh, how could this have been going on right under our eyes?
[2:09:12.320 --> 2:09:19.320]  Anybody who's connected to God knows that higher education in this country and college in the west has been totally corrupted
[2:09:19.320 --> 2:09:24.320]  So this is old news for people that get it, new news for people that don't
[2:09:24.320 --> 2:09:30.320]  Leo, just talk about your experience with that because, I mean, you've written the books, you've seen it all firsthand
[2:09:30.320 --> 2:09:32.320]  What is your take on that?
[2:09:32.320 --> 2:09:38.320]  I would say that in America, incredibly enough, you really have right from the very first
[2:09:38.320 --> 2:09:43.320]  From the establishment of the United States of America in 1776, the phenomenon of the fraternities
[2:09:43.320 --> 2:09:50.320]  And of the sororities in colleges in a way that we didn't have until a little while ago
[2:09:50.320 --> 2:09:56.320]  Even here in Europe, I mean, of course, there's been some very old ones, especially in Germany
[2:09:56.320 --> 2:10:06.320]  But in the U.S. is a really wide phenomenon that has characterized the spread not only of secrecy at certain levels
[2:10:06.320 --> 2:10:16.320]  But the possibility also of these fraternities and these sororities to conspire in a way against, you know,
[2:10:16.320 --> 2:10:22.320]  Making sure that their own members were always in front of the others in society in the end
[2:10:22.320 --> 2:10:29.320]  So I think that that is already something, the fraternity system in North America is already something that should make us wonder
[2:10:29.320 --> 2:10:34.320]  About the genuinity of the way the universities are
[2:10:34.320 --> 2:10:44.320]  But also the fact that we have a lot of Jesuit universities and other universities that are run always by the old establishment
[2:10:44.320 --> 2:10:53.320]  Of course, the old establishment has all the interest to give you a specific model that doesn't have to go outside certain schemes
[2:10:53.320 --> 2:10:56.320]  Because otherwise you become a threat to society
[2:10:56.320 --> 2:11:03.320]  So in the end, when you go and study in a college, in a university, well, you come out more ignorant than you went in
[2:11:03.320 --> 2:11:12.320]  Because either you have a closed mind, but if you really have an open mind, they are implementing on your system
[2:11:12.320 --> 2:11:19.320]  You can't really break because otherwise you go out of the academic perception of things
[2:11:19.320 --> 2:11:24.320]  So that is what I criticize, especially because you said you talked about God
[2:11:24.320 --> 2:11:33.320]  Well, God is something more, it's not about some satanic initiation right or some diability
[2:11:33.320 --> 2:11:43.320]  God is about believing and having faith in something that will give you access to everything and more, of course
[2:11:43.320 --> 2:11:52.320]  And the possibility of unlimited access to knowledge because that's what happens when you're really embracing God and the love of God
[2:11:52.320 --> 2:12:00.320]  That's why real knowledge still preserves in monasteries, in ancient places and libraries that see these custodians
[2:12:00.320 --> 2:12:07.320]  That seem a bit like in the movie, in the name of the road, out of these dark libraries
[2:12:07.320 --> 2:12:12.320]  But that is the way knowledge is still preserved in a very jealous way
[2:12:12.320 --> 2:12:17.320]  I think if we have to open it up to the world, of course it should be opened up to the world
[2:12:17.320 --> 2:12:24.320]  It should be done also with a lot of respect because this knowledge is something that pathways also hold
[2:12:24.320 --> 2:12:32.320]  So we should have a certain respect for it, the creation around us, the universe is all holy, is all part of God
[2:12:32.320 --> 2:12:40.320]  So I think that's very important for us to go towards, what they're doing in CERN is disrespecting God
[2:12:40.320 --> 2:12:49.320]  Even the mockery ritual that they did outside of CERN once, even if it wasn't a real human sacrifice
[2:12:49.320 --> 2:12:59.320]  It's still disgusting to think that these scientists can have fun in front of this pagan statue disrespecting God in such a way
[2:12:59.320 --> 2:13:08.320]  Well actually, Leo, hold on, stick on this for a second because CERN with the Hadron Collider and all the crazy stuff they're doing over there and colliding particles
[2:13:08.320 --> 2:13:15.320]  And then you had the tunnel that they built, the longest tunnel, it's in Europe and they had that weird parade with all the satanic crap
[2:13:15.320 --> 2:13:18.320]  What is that about? Why do they do that, Leo?
[2:13:18.320 --> 2:13:26.320]  Today we are celebrating 30 years since the invention of the World Wide Web inside CERN
[2:13:26.320 --> 2:13:36.320]  Today, right today, so I mean 30 years ago the World Wide Web where we are talking, we are transmitting now, was born out of CERN
[2:13:36.320 --> 2:13:45.320]  Now we have to see if in the long run this World Wide Web doesn't become just another tool of evil
[2:13:45.320 --> 2:14:00.320]  So that's why we have to really be very cautious at this moment of time before the AEI take over and everything that of course will make it impossible for human beings at that point to have any relevance in society
[2:14:00.320 --> 2:14:06.320]  And so that's the thing too, and that's what I'm saying, you need that connection to God
[2:14:06.320 --> 2:14:16.320]  It's not like, oh my gosh, like AEI is ultimately going to be evil no matter what or it's the devil, it's realizing the threats, it's realizing how Satan can co-opt it
[2:14:16.320 --> 2:14:20.320]  And it's realizing how it can be used against humanity to thwart humanity
[2:14:20.320 --> 2:14:27.320]  And that's what I'm saying, the person that's not connected to God is just like, oh yeah, give me the AEI, just give me Hollywood
[2:14:27.320 --> 2:14:35.320]  But it's that discernment through God that kind of gives you that pause to say, well now wait a second, what are we really dealing with here?
[2:14:35.320 --> 2:14:38.320]  What are the real implications of this?
[2:14:38.320 --> 2:14:42.320]  Well, transhumanism is satanic
[2:14:42.320 --> 2:14:50.320]  So the fact that everybody in transhumanism is promoting the idea of merging man with machine
[2:14:50.320 --> 2:14:53.320]  Well, this is already satanic, you see
[2:14:53.320 --> 2:15:05.320]  The fact that behind transhumanism there was a Jesuit called Pierre Carden, who was the father of transhumanism
[2:15:05.320 --> 2:15:16.320]  He was regarded by wire as one of the creators of the internet and is one of the main and central figures of my latest book which I have just published
[2:15:16.320 --> 2:15:23.320]  Because this whole age of cybersatan has been hashered in by the Jesuits
[2:15:23.320 --> 2:15:26.320]  And the Jesuits are in full control of it
[2:15:26.320 --> 2:15:32.320]  And if we don't realize this, well, I mean, Georgetown, you know, it's a great place
[2:15:32.320 --> 2:15:42.320]  Oh yeah, exactly, if they get the microchip in all the humans, you flip the switch and you're gone
[2:15:42.320 --> 2:15:47.320]  But that's the ultimate end game, isn't it? Because humans are scum according to Satan
[2:15:47.320 --> 2:15:55.320]  Leo Zagami, thank you so much, LeoZagami.com folks, always great stuff from him, check out his books, they're game changers

[2:20:26.320 --> 2:20:31.320]  I've got some news that I want to knock out first before we're joined by Alex though
[2:20:31.320 --> 2:20:39.320]  And before I get to the rest of it, I want to tie it in to something that we provide a solution for
[2:20:39.320 --> 2:20:48.320]  First of all, you had this story out today, breathing in before doing something may actually make you better at it
[2:20:48.320 --> 2:21:01.320]  And I have learned that just in my life and even before I start a segment a lot of times, I take deep breaths, it's part of meditation, it's taught in yoga as well
[2:21:01.320 --> 2:21:12.320]  And so, yeah, and really it's just about getting oxygen into your blood, getting oxygen into your brain, that's the deep breathing, that's why people do it
[2:21:12.320 --> 2:21:22.320]  But the problem with those exercises, air pollution deaths are double previous estimates finds research
[2:21:22.320 --> 2:21:31.320]  Scientists use new data to estimate that nearly 800,000 people die prematurely each year in Europe because of dirty air
[2:21:31.320 --> 2:21:40.320]  You also had studies come out that said the average US home is as polluted as a major metropolitan area
[2:21:40.320 --> 2:21:49.320]  So, yeah, you need to do deep breathing meditation practices to help you focus and it's healthy and it's good
[2:21:49.320 --> 2:21:55.320]  The problem is the air is so polluted, it can literally lead to early death
[2:21:55.320 --> 2:22:05.320]  And so, we have a solution at infowarstore.com and that is the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is $50 off right now
[2:22:05.320 --> 2:22:14.320]  So look, I first started to really get into meditation and learn the power of it not quite 10 years ago
[2:22:14.320 --> 2:22:22.320]  But when I was kind of, I don't want to say experimenting with Qigong and Taoism
[2:22:22.320 --> 2:22:31.320]  But when you do the Qigong, there's a bunch of breathing exercises and they teach you different positions of your body and it's supposed to connect you with higher consciousnesses and stuff
[2:22:31.320 --> 2:22:35.320]  But it's, you know, breathing is one of the big things
[2:22:35.320 --> 2:22:46.320]  And so, when you're at home and you're praying or you're meditating or you're doing yoga or something like that, or you're just taking a deep breath before you're getting ready to do something
[2:22:46.320 --> 2:22:49.320]  Make sure that you're breathing in clean air, ladies and gentlemen
[2:22:49.320 --> 2:22:57.320]  Get the Alexa Pure Breeze from infowarstore.com and quite frankly, you're going to be amazed at the difference
[2:22:57.320 --> 2:23:00.320]  You really will be amazed at the difference
[2:23:00.320 --> 2:23:08.320]  And on a certain level, you're going to kind of probably be disgusted when you look at the air filter after it's been running for three months
[2:23:08.320 --> 2:23:13.320]  You'll be shocked at how disgusting the air in your home actually is, folks
[2:23:13.320 --> 2:23:18.320]  And the Alexa Pure Breeze air filter is top quality, the best

[2:23:35.320 --> 2:23:41.320]  If you have pets in your home, they're making the air not clean and they're making it smell bad

[2:24:23.320 --> 2:24:28.320]  Find BuzzFeed, find Media Matters, breathe in the toxic air
[2:24:28.320 --> 2:24:30.320]  Not my problem
[2:24:30.320 --> 2:24:40.320]  Now, let me just pile drive through this news in no rhyme or reason here
[2:24:40.320 --> 2:24:49.320]  Democrats to introduce Bill, oh my gosh, sorry, I just, like I said, I just picked up a stack of news and I just piled driving through it
[2:24:49.320 --> 2:24:54.320]  Now I remember what the story was. This is real. This is not the onion
[2:24:54.320 --> 2:24:57.320]  Jamie White has the story at infowarstore.com
[2:24:57.320 --> 2:25:04.320]  Democrats to introduce Bill requiring men to call police when they release sperm from their testicles
[2:25:04.320 --> 2:25:11.320]  A pair of Georgia Democrat lawmakers are planning to introduce a bill that would require men to call police when they ejaculate
[2:25:11.320 --> 2:25:17.320]  And classify unprotected sex as aggravated assault
[2:25:17.320 --> 2:25:33.320]  That's Deshaun Kendrick of Lithu-Lithonia and Park Cannon of Atlanta putting forward a testicular bill of rights
[2:25:33.320 --> 2:25:41.320]  In protest of Georgia's house passing a bill preventing abortions once a heartbeat is detected
[2:25:41.320 --> 2:25:54.320]  Kendrick and Cannon's bill would require men who are age 55 and older to immediately report to the county sheriff or local law enforcement agency
[2:25:54.320 --> 2:26:00.320]  When he releases sperm from his testicles according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution
[2:26:00.320 --> 2:26:07.320]  Quote, this bill helps men who are well past reproductive age to self-report when they willfully engage in conception
[2:26:07.320 --> 2:26:14.320]  This is insanity
[2:26:14.320 --> 2:26:18.320]  And we've got the video for this one. Let me see how long this video is
[2:26:18.320 --> 2:26:26.320]  Number seven, black trans woman arrested suspected of hate crime spree against white people
[2:26:26.320 --> 2:26:28.320]  Guys just roll the B roll on this
[2:26:28.320 --> 2:26:35.320]  So you've got this black trans woman who's going around intentionally spraying people because they're white
[2:26:35.320 --> 2:26:41.320]  And she's even asking them, are you white? Are you white?
[2:26:41.320 --> 2:26:45.320]  And then they say yes, and then she sprays them with pepper spray
[2:26:45.320 --> 2:26:48.320]  Funny, I didn't see that one on CNN
[2:26:48.320 --> 2:26:53.320]  Hmm, think you'll hear about that on MSNBC?
[2:26:53.320 --> 2:26:59.320]  Hmm, will Good Morning America be interviewing the victims of that racist?
[2:26:59.320 --> 2:27:09.320]  Hmm, somehow I don't think so, but they'll bring Jesse Small-Ed on for a redemption piece, bet your bottom dollar
[2:27:09.320 --> 2:27:14.320]  Meanwhile, there's another one in here
[2:27:14.320 --> 2:27:24.320]  Bartender refuses to serve man in MAGA visor and attempts to rip his phone out of his hand
[2:27:24.320 --> 2:27:30.320]  So, I mean, you know, they sit here and they act like the Trump supporters are the hateful ones
[2:27:30.320 --> 2:27:33.320]  Trump supporters are intolerant, Trump supporters are getting violent
[2:27:33.320 --> 2:27:36.320]  Trump supporters are beating people senselessly
[2:27:36.320 --> 2:27:39.320]  And it's literally nothing but Trump haters
[2:27:39.320 --> 2:27:45.320]  And so again, folks, you have to understand how deceptive the devil is
[2:27:45.320 --> 2:27:50.320]  The devil's media tells you Trump supporters are bad, Trump supporters are racist, Trump supporters are bigots
[2:27:50.320 --> 2:27:53.320]  Trump supporters are intolerant, Trump supporters are beating people
[2:27:53.320 --> 2:27:56.320]  And it's literally the exact opposite
[2:27:56.320 --> 2:27:58.320]  All documented
[2:27:58.320 --> 2:28:03.320]  I mean, you got the story from Breitbart, it's up to like, I think, 700 cases of assault against Trump supporters
[2:28:03.320 --> 2:28:05.320]  That's not even half of them
[2:28:05.320 --> 2:28:07.320]  That's not even half of them
[2:28:07.320 --> 2:28:12.320]  I've submitted two of the examples of like the 10 that I've just experienced
[2:28:12.320 --> 2:28:17.320]  And so I know I'm not the only one, and these two latest ones aren't even on there
[2:28:17.320 --> 2:28:20.320]  So, but the media doesn't cover it
[2:28:20.320 --> 2:28:22.320]  And this is how they engage in their deception
[2:28:22.320 --> 2:28:26.320]  They lie about Trump 24-7, they lie about Trump supporters 24-7
[2:28:26.320 --> 2:28:30.320]  And then they ignore the real news, which is their audience
[2:28:30.320 --> 2:28:35.320]  That they got hopped up, that they incited, that they made hateful and angry
[2:28:35.320 --> 2:28:38.320]  They go out, they attack white people, they attack Trump supporters
[2:28:38.320 --> 2:28:41.320]  And it's all because of CNN, it's all because of MMSNBC
[2:28:41.320 --> 2:28:44.320]  It's all because of the Washington Post, it's all because of the New York Times
[2:28:44.320 --> 2:28:47.320]  It's all because of Don Lemon, it's all because of Rachel Maddow
[2:28:47.320 --> 2:28:51.320]  It's all your guys' faults, and you know you're inciting violence in this country
[2:28:51.320 --> 2:28:54.320]  And that's why you're blaming us, you are the liars
[2:28:55.320 --> 2:28:57.320]  Know someone with a drinking or drug problem?
[2:28:57.320 --> 2:29:00.320]  Learn how to get sober after we share these stories
[2:29:00.320 --> 2:29:05.320]  I was 35 with two beautiful children when my life and addiction started to spiral out of control
[2:29:05.320 --> 2:29:10.320]  After my divorce, I went into a depression cycle and started drinking more often
[2:29:10.320 --> 2:29:12.320]  And using prescription drugs
[2:29:12.320 --> 2:29:17.320]  After my second DWI and arrest, my ex-husband threatened to take our children away from me

[2:32:10.320 --> 2:32:12.320]  In the world is energy drinks
[2:32:12.320 --> 2:32:14.320]  And energy supplements
[2:32:14.320 --> 2:32:16.320]  But they are riddled with dyes
[2:32:16.320 --> 2:32:18.320]  And toxins and synthetic caffeine
[2:32:18.320 --> 2:32:21.320]  And other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost
[2:32:21.320 --> 2:32:23.320]  But burn out in just a few hours

[2:32:47.320 --> 2:32:49.320]  For the first time you take it
[2:32:49.320 --> 2:32:51.320]  Because turbo force is named turbo force
[2:32:51.320 --> 2:32:53.320]  Because it will take you into overdrive
[2:32:53.320 --> 2:33:18.320]  For the first time you take it
[2:33:18.320 --> 2:33:23.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:33:23.320 --> 2:33:26.320]  And now your host, Owen Shroyer
[2:33:26.320 --> 2:33:28.320]  Alex Jones is about to join us
[2:33:28.320 --> 2:33:29.320]  I want to play this clip
[2:33:29.320 --> 2:33:31.320]  I may have time for some more news
[2:33:31.320 --> 2:33:33.320]  But I want to kind of put a bookend
[2:33:33.320 --> 2:33:35.320]  On something I've been talking about
[2:33:35.320 --> 2:33:36.320]  And I'll do that at the end of this clip
[2:33:36.320 --> 2:33:38.320]  Here's Rashida Tlaib
[2:33:38.320 --> 2:33:42.320]  Blaming Islamophobia for Ilhan Omar criticism
[2:33:42.320 --> 2:33:44.320]  Representative Omar
[2:33:44.320 --> 2:33:46.320]  Why do you think it's in your own party
[2:33:46.320 --> 2:33:48.320]  You know, I'm trying to figure it out
[2:33:48.320 --> 2:33:50.320]  It's just this past week
[2:33:50.320 --> 2:33:54.320]  I feel and I know this would be
[2:33:54.320 --> 2:33:56.320]  Somewhat shocking for some
[2:33:56.320 --> 2:33:59.320]  But I think Islamophobia is very much among
[2:33:59.320 --> 2:34:01.320]  The Democratic Party as well as the Republican Party
[2:34:01.320 --> 2:34:03.320]  And I know that's hard for people to hear
[2:34:03.320 --> 2:34:05.320]  But there's only been four members of Congress
[2:34:05.320 --> 2:34:08.320]  Of Muslim faith, three of them currently serve
[2:34:08.320 --> 2:34:10.320]  In this institution
[2:34:10.320 --> 2:34:11.320]  More of us need to get elected
[2:34:11.320 --> 2:34:14.320]  But more of us need to understand
[2:34:14.320 --> 2:34:16.320]  As we come into this institution
[2:34:16.320 --> 2:34:19.320]  That I have a lot of work to do with my colleagues
[2:34:19.320 --> 2:34:22.320]  So you think Democrats have some Islamophobia
[2:34:22.320 --> 2:34:24.320]  And that's at the root of some of this consternation
[2:34:24.320 --> 2:34:26.320]  I think our country is struggling with it
[2:34:26.320 --> 2:34:28.320]  So this whole notion of Islamophobia
[2:34:28.320 --> 2:34:30.320]  What is it, where does it come from
[2:34:30.320 --> 2:34:33.320]  We were told that radical Islam hates the West
[2:34:33.320 --> 2:34:35.320]  Wants to kill us all
[2:34:35.320 --> 2:34:37.320]  And attack this on September 11, 2001
[2:34:37.320 --> 2:34:39.320]  So until they disavow that as not radical
[2:34:39.320 --> 2:34:41.320]  Islamic terrorism
[2:34:41.320 --> 2:34:43.320]  Then Islamophobia is fake news
[2:34:43.320 --> 2:34:45.320]  Alex Jones joins us now
[2:34:45.320 --> 2:34:47.320]  Alex, all kinds of breaking stuff right now
[2:34:47.320 --> 2:34:49.320]  Internet censorship being ramped up
[2:34:49.320 --> 2:34:51.320]  The Democrats admitting they have nothing on Trump
[2:34:51.320 --> 2:34:53.320]  And like they never were investigating him to begin with
[2:34:53.320 --> 2:34:55.320]  What's on your mind today, Alex?
[2:34:55.320 --> 2:34:57.320]  Well, there's a lot of angles to cover here
[2:34:57.320 --> 2:34:59.320]  And I took off a few weeks ago
[2:34:59.320 --> 2:35:01.320]  And again, I've taken off for four or five days now
[2:35:01.320 --> 2:35:03.320]  Just because I realize
[2:35:03.320 --> 2:35:05.320]  That I've been working
[2:35:05.320 --> 2:35:07.320]  16, 18 hours a day
[2:35:07.320 --> 2:35:09.320]  And just getting too aggressive
[2:35:09.320 --> 2:35:11.320]  Too angry on air
[2:35:11.320 --> 2:35:13.320]  So it's very important that I do take time off
[2:35:13.320 --> 2:35:15.320]  Because we're having a lot of big victories
[2:35:15.320 --> 2:35:17.320]  A lot of big successes
[2:35:17.320 --> 2:35:19.320]  It's important for all of us to go into dry dock
[2:35:19.320 --> 2:35:21.320]  Occasionally and take some time off
[2:35:21.320 --> 2:35:23.320]  But I always get very, very retrospective
[2:35:23.320 --> 2:35:25.320]  And also very, very clear headed
[2:35:25.320 --> 2:35:27.320]  When I can just take off for five days
[2:35:27.320 --> 2:35:29.320]  And I've actually for the first time in years
[2:35:29.320 --> 2:35:31.320]  98% disconnected
[2:35:31.320 --> 2:35:33.320]  From the news
[2:35:33.320 --> 2:35:35.320]  Meaning I only spent probably an hour a day
[2:35:35.320 --> 2:35:37.320]  Looking at news
[2:35:37.320 --> 2:35:39.320]  And information where I normally
[2:35:39.320 --> 2:35:41.320]  Ironically probably spent six, eight hours a day
[2:35:41.320 --> 2:35:43.320]  Totally focused on it
[2:35:43.320 --> 2:35:45.320]  But
[2:35:45.320 --> 2:35:47.320]  Just looking at the headlines
[2:35:47.320 --> 2:35:49.320]  At infowars.com
[2:35:49.320 --> 2:35:51.320]  Just looking at the headlines
[2:35:51.320 --> 2:35:53.320]  At newswars.com
[2:35:53.320 --> 2:35:55.320]  Places like rugreport.com
[2:35:55.320 --> 2:35:57.320]  But also enemy transmission systems
[2:35:57.320 --> 2:35:59.320]  Like CNN
[2:35:59.320 --> 2:36:01.320]  And the rest of them
[2:36:01.320 --> 2:36:03.320]  What you were just talking about is very, very clear
[2:36:03.320 --> 2:36:05.320]  So I've just got a list of notes here that I'm going to cover
[2:36:05.320 --> 2:36:07.320]  And then I was going to be back live tomorrow
[2:36:07.320 --> 2:36:09.320]  But
[2:36:09.320 --> 2:36:11.320]  They had said they were going to move my deposition
[2:36:11.320 --> 2:36:13.320]  On the fake Sandy Hook lawsuits next week
[2:36:13.320 --> 2:36:15.320]  But they're not moved
[2:36:15.320 --> 2:36:17.320]  So that's over the next two days
[2:36:17.320 --> 2:36:19.320]  But I'll be back Friday
[2:36:19.320 --> 2:36:21.320]  I won't be taking off for months
[2:36:21.320 --> 2:36:23.320]  After that
[2:36:23.320 --> 2:36:25.320]  Everybody can be absolutely assured of that
[2:36:25.320 --> 2:36:27.320]  Because there's so much to cover
[2:36:27.320 --> 2:36:29.320]  But there's a lot of things I can't tell listeners
[2:36:29.320 --> 2:36:31.320]  I can't tell viewers, but know this
[2:36:31.320 --> 2:36:33.320]  We're in the thick of a fight for the very heart
[2:36:33.320 --> 2:36:35.320]  And soul of this country in the future
[2:36:35.320 --> 2:36:37.320]  We are winning major victories
[2:36:37.320 --> 2:36:39.320]  We are winning the fight
[2:36:39.320 --> 2:36:41.320]  Some of the things going on, I can't tell folks obviously
[2:36:41.320 --> 2:36:43.320]  For strategic reasons
[2:36:43.320 --> 2:36:45.320]  But this is real
[2:36:45.320 --> 2:36:47.320]  This revolution to take back our country
[2:36:47.320 --> 2:36:49.320]  And take back other nations is real
[2:36:49.320 --> 2:36:51.320]  It is happening
[2:36:51.320 --> 2:36:53.320]  And thanks to all the viewers and listeners
[2:36:53.320 --> 2:36:55.320]  We're in this together
[2:36:55.320 --> 2:36:57.320]  Okay, so let me just lay out the four or five things I want to cover here
[2:36:57.320 --> 2:36:59.320]  First off
[2:36:59.320 --> 2:37:01.320]  Huawei
[2:37:01.320 --> 2:37:03.320]  And the global war
[2:37:03.320 --> 2:37:05.320]  Which is currently happening
[2:37:05.320 --> 2:37:07.320]  One of the biggest news there is
[2:37:07.320 --> 2:37:09.320]  Also
[2:37:09.320 --> 2:37:11.320]  AOC and her incredible corruption
[2:37:11.320 --> 2:37:13.320]  In our face and why she's allowed to do that
[2:37:13.320 --> 2:37:15.320]  We'll also
[2:37:15.320 --> 2:37:17.320]  Look at Pelosi claiming
[2:37:17.320 --> 2:37:19.320]  That she's not going to try to impeach Trump
[2:37:19.320 --> 2:37:21.320]  It's because they have nothing
[2:37:21.320 --> 2:37:23.320]  And they don't have to vote for the Senate
[2:37:23.320 --> 2:37:25.320]  Because she's acting like she's big magnanimous
[2:37:25.320 --> 2:37:27.320]  It's because she's weak
[2:37:27.320 --> 2:37:29.320]  We'll look at that
[2:37:29.320 --> 2:37:31.320]  We'll also look at the power
[2:37:31.320 --> 2:37:33.320]  Versus character
[2:37:33.320 --> 2:37:35.320]  And how civilizations
[2:37:35.320 --> 2:37:37.320]  Are built on character, not raw power
[2:37:37.320 --> 2:37:39.320]  And then when you're talking about radical Islam
[2:37:39.320 --> 2:37:41.320]  And how it's green-lit and promoted
[2:37:41.320 --> 2:37:43.320]  And supported by the West
[2:37:43.320 --> 2:37:45.320]  And major corporations
[2:37:45.320 --> 2:37:47.320]  We have mass car deaths
[2:37:47.320 --> 2:37:49.320]  Shooting scavings every day
[2:37:49.320 --> 2:37:51.320]  And for every attack we hear about
[2:37:51.320 --> 2:37:53.320]  There are
[2:37:53.320 --> 2:37:55.320]  Five or six that we don't hear about
[2:37:55.320 --> 2:37:57.320]  And I'm going to be breaking some of that when I come back
[2:37:57.320 --> 2:37:59.320]  To the amount it takes today
[2:37:59.320 --> 2:38:01.320]  Also
[2:38:01.320 --> 2:38:03.320]  Huge censorship news
[2:38:03.320 --> 2:38:05.320]  That's come out where
[2:38:05.320 --> 2:38:07.320]  Google and YouTube and others admit
[2:38:07.320 --> 2:38:09.320]  That they are paid to play
[2:38:09.320 --> 2:38:11.320]  Whoever pays them is what the search engine rank is
[2:38:11.320 --> 2:38:13.320]  So their lives to Congress if they're not doing it
[2:38:13.320 --> 2:38:15.320]  Are just their incredible
[2:38:15.320 --> 2:38:17.320]  Achilles' heel
[2:38:17.320 --> 2:38:19.320]  So that's all coming up
[2:38:19.320 --> 2:38:21.320]  But the first thing I want to hit is this
[2:38:21.320 --> 2:38:23.320]  We told folks
[2:38:23.320 --> 2:38:25.320]  Twenty years ago because it was in
[2:38:25.320 --> 2:38:27.320]  The Defense Intelligence Briefings to Congress
[2:38:27.320 --> 2:38:29.320]  People go, how do you know all this?
[2:38:29.320 --> 2:38:31.320]  Well, it was public
[2:38:31.320 --> 2:38:33.320]  The Defense Intelligence Agency and others
[2:38:33.320 --> 2:38:35.320]  Pointed out that Democrats
[2:38:35.320 --> 2:38:37.320]  And Republican Blue Bloods were selling us out to China
[2:38:37.320 --> 2:38:39.320]  Twenty years ago and that many of our
[2:38:39.320 --> 2:38:41.320]  Expensive defense chips
[2:38:41.320 --> 2:38:43.320]  Were actually being made in China
[2:38:43.320 --> 2:38:45.320]  And then shipped into the U.S.
[2:38:45.320 --> 2:38:47.320]  They'd have some other circuitry added
[2:38:47.320 --> 2:38:49.320]  But basically they were 90% shotgun made
[2:38:49.320 --> 2:38:51.320]  Whether it was our cruise missiles
[2:38:51.320 --> 2:38:53.320]  Or smart bombs or helicopter avionics
[2:38:53.320 --> 2:38:55.320]  And guidance systems for jet fighter avionics
[2:38:55.320 --> 2:38:57.320]  Or drone avionics
[2:38:57.320 --> 2:38:59.320]  Or guidance systems for our propulsion systems
[2:38:59.320 --> 2:39:01.320]  We would develop a technology
[2:39:01.320 --> 2:39:03.320]  We would then
[2:39:03.320 --> 2:39:05.320]  Sell it
[2:39:05.320 --> 2:39:07.320]  To other foreign countries
[2:39:07.320 --> 2:39:09.320]  In some cases we would then give it to China
[2:39:09.320 --> 2:39:11.320]  They would then knock it off and sell it
[2:39:11.320 --> 2:39:13.320]  For 10% of the price
[2:39:13.320 --> 2:39:15.320]  Even back to us
[2:39:15.320 --> 2:39:17.320]  So that's how these scams work
[2:39:17.320 --> 2:39:19.320]  And it's all about selling America out
[2:39:19.320 --> 2:39:21.320]  The industrializing us, setting us up
[2:39:21.320 --> 2:39:23.320]  To capitulate to China giving China the Panama Canal
[2:39:23.320 --> 2:39:25.320]  All the deep water ports
[2:39:25.320 --> 2:39:27.320]  Giving them 99%
[2:39:27.320 --> 2:39:29.320]  That's 98% of the rare earth minerals
[2:39:29.320 --> 2:39:31.320]  All of that strategically
[2:39:31.320 --> 2:39:33.320]  Positioning them
[2:39:33.320 --> 2:39:35.320]  To bring in the new world order
[2:39:35.320 --> 2:39:37.320]  But you can say what you want about Trump
[2:39:37.320 --> 2:39:39.320]  Letting us float in the wind
[2:39:39.320 --> 2:39:41.320]  Hanging us out to dry to twist in the wind
[2:39:41.320 --> 2:39:43.320]  With the censorship and really destroying himself
[2:39:43.320 --> 2:39:45.320]  And making it a campaign promise
[2:39:45.320 --> 2:39:47.320]  To fix it if we reelect him in a year and a half
[2:39:47.320 --> 2:39:49.320]  I'm really pissed off about that
[2:39:49.320 --> 2:39:51.320]  He said he'd go after the vaccines
[2:39:51.320 --> 2:39:53.320]  He closed those, he's rolled over to that
[2:39:53.320 --> 2:39:55.320]  Now they're censoring anybody off the internet
[2:39:55.320 --> 2:39:57.320]  That reads off vaccine inserts
[2:39:57.320 --> 2:39:59.320]  To come with the vaccine that said they could cause paralysis
[2:39:59.320 --> 2:40:01.320]  Death, cancer, sterilization
[2:40:01.320 --> 2:40:03.320]  All we're saying is there's damn dangers here
[2:40:03.320 --> 2:40:05.320]  Look at it
[2:40:05.320 --> 2:40:07.320]  So I've got a lot of beef with Trump
[2:40:07.320 --> 2:40:09.320]  And I'm going to be bringing those out on air
[2:40:09.320 --> 2:40:11.320]  Only because he only pays attention
[2:40:11.320 --> 2:40:13.320]  According to high level folks I've talked to
[2:40:13.320 --> 2:40:15.320]  When you go after him
[2:40:15.320 --> 2:40:17.320]  Which is good, he responds to pressure
[2:40:17.320 --> 2:40:19.320]  Unlike the Clintons, they just try to shut you down
[2:40:19.320 --> 2:40:21.320]  To pressure him, Trump gets reminded by it
[2:40:21.320 --> 2:40:23.320]  He's a busy guy
[2:40:23.320 --> 2:40:25.320]  But that said
[2:40:25.320 --> 2:40:27.320]  Even CNN had the headline yesterday
[2:40:27.320 --> 2:40:29.320]  U.S. government says
[2:40:29.320 --> 2:40:31.320]  Wall-way and national security threat
[2:40:31.320 --> 2:40:33.320]  Stealing U.S. data
[2:40:33.320 --> 2:40:35.320]  It's setting up bases
[2:40:35.320 --> 2:40:37.320]  Coast to coast from Indiana to Texas
[2:40:37.320 --> 2:40:39.320]  From New York
[2:40:39.320 --> 2:40:41.320]  To Utah
[2:40:41.320 --> 2:40:43.320]  I mean all 50 states
[2:40:43.320 --> 2:40:45.320]  5G super
[2:40:45.320 --> 2:40:47.320]  Tiny waves that go through
[2:40:47.320 --> 2:40:49.320]  Anything and everything
[2:40:49.320 --> 2:40:51.320]  And steal all your data
[2:40:51.320 --> 2:40:53.320]  And then runs all your data through their hubs
[2:40:53.320 --> 2:40:55.320]  And it's CHICOM government run
[2:40:55.320 --> 2:40:57.320]  And there's the Pentagon saying
[2:40:57.320 --> 2:40:59.320]  What we already know from the specs
[2:40:59.320 --> 2:41:01.320]  All of these cell phone systems
[2:41:01.320 --> 2:41:03.320]  And digital systems and smart meters
[2:41:03.320 --> 2:41:05.320]  You pay for them
[2:41:05.320 --> 2:41:07.320]  But their main business, just like the cell phone
[2:41:07.320 --> 2:41:09.320]  Is not really a cell phone
[2:41:09.320 --> 2:41:11.320]  It's a tracking and surveillance system
[2:41:11.320 --> 2:41:13.320]  It is a control grid to scoop everything up
[2:41:13.320 --> 2:41:15.320]  And by design
[2:41:15.320 --> 2:41:17.320]  To be on those services
[2:41:17.320 --> 2:41:19.320]  They've got to have almost all the code keys
[2:41:19.320 --> 2:41:21.320]  And systems to get into
[2:41:21.320 --> 2:41:23.320]  Your phone
[2:41:23.320 --> 2:41:25.320]  Plus they all have the keystroke systems
[2:41:25.320 --> 2:41:27.320]  To break it if they want
[2:41:27.320 --> 2:41:29.320]  So the CHICOMs
[2:41:29.320 --> 2:41:31.320]  Google has said they'll work with and not the Pentagon
[2:41:31.320 --> 2:41:33.320]  And that Apple's moved over to China
[2:41:33.320 --> 2:41:35.320]  Get this through your head folks
[2:41:35.320 --> 2:41:37.320]  I know you're getting it, but understand
[2:41:37.320 --> 2:41:39.320]  They are putting in 5G
[2:41:39.320 --> 2:41:41.320]  From Africa to Asia
[2:41:41.320 --> 2:41:43.320]  To the United States, North America, South America
[2:41:43.320 --> 2:41:45.320]  Way ahead of us
[2:41:45.320 --> 2:41:47.320]  They've got 17 countries already
[2:41:47.320 --> 2:41:49.320]  Implementing their global social score
[2:41:49.320 --> 2:41:51.320]  That's a world mark of the beast
[2:41:51.320 --> 2:41:53.320]  Total control surveillance system
[2:41:53.320 --> 2:41:55.320]  And the Pentagon word for word came out yesterday
[2:41:55.320 --> 2:41:57.320]  Even CNN had to report it
[2:41:57.320 --> 2:41:59.320]  And said they're scooping up all of your data
[2:41:59.320 --> 2:42:01.320]  It's a national security threat
[2:42:01.320 --> 2:42:03.320]  Any ally that uses Huawei
[2:42:03.320 --> 2:42:05.320]  We cannot be allied with
[2:42:05.320 --> 2:42:07.320]  It's the truth
[2:42:07.320 --> 2:42:09.320]  So say what you want about Trump
[2:42:09.320 --> 2:42:11.320]  The fundamental crime he committed
[2:42:11.320 --> 2:42:13.320]  When I figured this out
[2:42:13.320 --> 2:42:15.320]  Was he said America still exists
[2:42:15.320 --> 2:42:17.320]  We're not under CHICOM control
[2:42:17.320 --> 2:42:19.320]  Why should we parlay and sell all our power out
[2:42:19.320 --> 2:42:21.320]  Even from a dictatorial perspective
[2:42:21.320 --> 2:42:23.320]  You want to use American prowess
[2:42:23.320 --> 2:42:25.320]  If you ran America
[2:42:25.320 --> 2:42:27.320]  Why would you want to sell it out?
[2:42:27.320 --> 2:42:29.320]  It makes no sense even from an evil perspective
[2:42:29.320 --> 2:42:31.320]  Unless you're against it
[2:42:31.320 --> 2:42:33.320]  Because we've had so much freedom
[2:42:33.320 --> 2:42:35.320]  They want to wreck the country
[2:42:35.320 --> 2:42:37.320]  And Trump stands with the Republic
[2:42:37.320 --> 2:42:39.320]  And that's why we've got to be behind Trump
[2:42:39.320 --> 2:42:41.320]  You know, I have a love-hate relationship with Trump
[2:42:41.320 --> 2:42:43.320]  I've done so much for Trump, so has our audience
[2:42:43.320 --> 2:42:45.320]  We've been through so much
[2:42:45.320 --> 2:42:47.320]  We're going to be right back and talk about this
[2:42:47.320 --> 2:42:49.320]  But this Huawei situation is ultra-massive
[2:42:49.320 --> 2:43:11.320]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like
[2:43:11.320 --> 2:43:29.320]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like
[2:43:29.320 --> 2:43:39.320]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like
[2:43:39.320 --> 2:43:41.320]  It's the peak of your optimal health
[2:43:41.320 --> 2:43:44.320]  Don't fall short on energy in the fight against tyranny
[2:43:44.320 --> 2:43:47.320]  Show the world what a true alpha male looks like today
[2:43:47.320 --> 2:43:49.320]  With alpha power at 50% off
[2:43:49.320 --> 2:43:55.320]  Only at the Info Wars store
[2:43:55.320 --> 2:43:57.320]  You know, the worst part about getting old
[2:43:57.320 --> 2:43:59.320]  I'm still strong at 45
[2:43:59.320 --> 2:44:01.320]  Is that I won't be there for my children someday
[2:44:01.320 --> 2:44:03.320]  That's why I need to make them strong now
[2:44:03.320 --> 2:44:05.320]  Now I can be there for my children
[2:44:05.320 --> 2:44:07.320]  Now I can make them strong
[2:44:07.320 --> 2:44:09.320]  Now I can teach them what I've learned
[2:44:09.320 --> 2:44:10.320]  But not once I'm gone
[2:44:10.320 --> 2:44:11.320]  You think of this digital age
[2:44:11.320 --> 2:44:12.320]  Your word's gone forever
[2:44:12.320 --> 2:44:13.320]  But now they're even better
[2:44:13.320 --> 2:44:15.320]  Getting rid of what you said they were before
[2:44:15.320 --> 2:44:17.320]  It's so much easier to burn video
[2:44:17.320 --> 2:44:19.320]  Or text or languages now that we have
[2:44:19.320 --> 2:44:21.320]  High-tech book burning, isn't it?
[2:44:21.320 --> 2:44:24.320]  But I have joined my will to the resistance
[2:44:24.320 --> 2:44:25.320]  I can't be destroyed now
[2:44:25.320 --> 2:44:27.320]  As long as I realize I've done right
[2:44:27.320 --> 2:44:29.320]  And as long as the people know the truth
[2:44:29.320 --> 2:44:31.320]  And you can't be destroyed either
[2:44:31.320 --> 2:44:33.320]  As long as you bind yourself to something
[2:44:33.320 --> 2:44:35.320]  And commit to it
[2:44:35.320 --> 2:44:37.320]  Through the fire for it
[2:44:37.320 --> 2:44:39.320]  There is a magic that then takes place
[2:44:39.320 --> 2:44:41.320]  That prints in space and time
[2:44:41.320 --> 2:44:43.320]  When you commit the award of mouth
[2:44:43.320 --> 2:44:44.320]  Or to pray for us
[2:44:44.320 --> 2:44:46.320]  Or to spread our articles and videos
[2:44:46.320 --> 2:44:48.320]  That overrides everything the enemy's doing
[2:44:48.320 --> 2:44:51.320]  So please now, commit to support Info Wars
[2:44:51.320 --> 2:44:52.320]  However you can

[2:45:19.320 --> 2:45:20.320]  When you get it in the box

[2:47:13.320 --> 2:47:14.320]  Alex is with us here
[2:47:14.320 --> 2:47:16.320]  And what I'm going to do here is
[2:47:16.320 --> 2:47:18.320]  I'm just going to lob up
[2:47:18.320 --> 2:47:20.320]  About four or five pitches for Alex
[2:47:20.320 --> 2:47:22.320]  To swing away at and knock out of the park
[2:47:22.320 --> 2:47:24.320]  You've got the internet censorship
[2:47:24.320 --> 2:47:26.320]  Ramping up on multiple different levels
[2:47:26.320 --> 2:47:28.320]  Zero hedge band from Facebook
[2:47:28.320 --> 2:47:31.320]  They're rigging movie reviews
[2:47:31.320 --> 2:47:33.320]  So that their liberal movies
[2:47:33.320 --> 2:47:35.320]  Get high reviews like Captain Marvel
[2:47:35.320 --> 2:47:37.320]  They're removing climate skeptics
[2:47:37.320 --> 2:47:39.320]  From having apps
[2:47:39.320 --> 2:47:41.320]  They're removing you if you post about vaccines
[2:47:41.320 --> 2:47:43.320]  And you know
[2:47:43.320 --> 2:47:45.320]  There's one thing I really want to get
[2:47:45.320 --> 2:47:46.320]  Alex's take on
[2:47:46.320 --> 2:47:49.320]  As the border crossings continue to get worse
[2:47:49.320 --> 2:47:51.320]  And this is hurting Trump's base
[2:47:51.320 --> 2:47:53.320]  But you know Alex
[2:47:53.320 --> 2:47:56.320]  I've been talking a lot about having God's vision today
[2:47:56.320 --> 2:47:58.320]  And you know I think a lot of people
[2:47:58.320 --> 2:48:01.320]  Don't fully understand what we do here at Infowars
[2:48:01.320 --> 2:48:03.320]  Because a lot of it is quite frankly
[2:48:03.320 --> 2:48:05.320]  Just trying to channel God
[2:48:05.320 --> 2:48:07.320]  And just fighting the devil
[2:48:07.320 --> 2:48:08.320]  In this spiritual battle
[2:48:08.320 --> 2:48:10.320]  But having God's discernment
[2:48:10.320 --> 2:48:11.320]  There's certain things Alex
[2:48:11.320 --> 2:48:13.320]  That I've experienced with you
[2:48:13.320 --> 2:48:15.320]  Where you'll say something to me
[2:48:15.320 --> 2:48:16.320]  And I'll be like wow Alex
[2:48:16.320 --> 2:48:17.320]  And then a couple months later
[2:48:17.320 --> 2:48:19.320]  It comes to full fruition
[2:48:19.320 --> 2:48:20.320]  And I'm like oh my gosh
[2:48:20.320 --> 2:48:22.320]  Are AirPods dangerous
[2:48:22.320 --> 2:48:24.320]  250 scientists warn they may be
[2:48:24.320 --> 2:48:26.320]  Now I have never used Bluetooth speakers
[2:48:26.320 --> 2:48:28.320]  Never used Bluetooth headsets
[2:48:28.320 --> 2:48:30.320]  And I never knew why the science was never out
[2:48:30.320 --> 2:48:32.320]  I just felt like there's something bad with it
[2:48:32.320 --> 2:48:33.320]  It's going to be bad
[2:48:33.320 --> 2:48:35.320]  Now they're learning that the waves
[2:48:35.320 --> 2:48:37.320]  The electromagnetic waves in the AirPods
[2:48:37.320 --> 2:48:39.320]  Can be zapping your brain
[2:48:39.320 --> 2:48:41.320]  Combine that with the 5G
[2:48:41.320 --> 2:48:43.320]  And we're pretty much dead
[2:48:43.320 --> 2:48:45.320]  So you know
[2:48:45.320 --> 2:48:47.320]  There's a bunch of stuff going on out there folks
[2:48:47.320 --> 2:48:49.320]  Let me tackle that one first
[2:48:49.320 --> 2:48:51.320]  Let me tackle that one first
[2:48:51.320 --> 2:48:53.320]  And again we're not trying to scare people folks
[2:48:53.320 --> 2:48:55.320]  It's how the devil works
[2:48:55.320 --> 2:48:57.320]  God gives us technology
[2:48:57.320 --> 2:48:59.320]  And our great brain that builds it
[2:48:59.320 --> 2:49:01.320]  But the devil and these globalists
[2:49:01.320 --> 2:49:03.320]  Any technology we then develop
[2:49:03.320 --> 2:49:04.320]  Has a Trojan horse
[2:49:04.320 --> 2:49:05.320]  So yes
[2:49:05.320 --> 2:49:07.320]  Putting the AirPods in your ears
[2:49:07.320 --> 2:49:09.320]  Having the Wi-Fi connected
[2:49:09.320 --> 2:49:11.320]  Having all that electromagnetic system
[2:49:11.320 --> 2:49:12.320]  Pushing through there
[2:49:12.320 --> 2:49:14.320]  With all the other electromagnetic radiation
[2:49:14.320 --> 2:49:15.320]  Was going on
[2:49:15.320 --> 2:49:17.320]  I was on Joe Rogan's show a week and a half ago
[2:49:17.320 --> 2:49:19.320]  Now the number two podcast in history
[2:49:19.320 --> 2:49:20.320]  Under Elon Musk
[2:49:20.320 --> 2:49:22.320]  Set in about a week through the number one in history
[2:49:22.320 --> 2:49:23.320]  Very proud of that
[2:49:23.320 --> 2:49:25.320]  Thanks to literature to spread the word
[2:49:25.320 --> 2:49:26.320]  And I said
[2:49:26.320 --> 2:49:28.320]  I remember the Baltimore Sun
[2:49:28.320 --> 2:49:31.320]  Reported on the CIA testing
[2:49:31.320 --> 2:49:32.320]  Microwaves
[2:49:32.320 --> 2:49:34.320]  Through the cell towers
[2:49:34.320 --> 2:49:35.320]  In 1999
[2:49:35.320 --> 2:49:36.320]  To calm the public
[2:49:36.320 --> 2:49:37.320]  Now
[2:49:37.320 --> 2:49:39.320]  Jamie is so good at searching
[2:49:39.320 --> 2:49:40.320]  And I'm not just kissing his butt
[2:49:40.320 --> 2:49:42.320]  It's true Joe's producer
[2:49:42.320 --> 2:49:44.320]  He found the article
[2:49:44.320 --> 2:49:46.320]  That I couldn't find for years
[2:49:46.320 --> 2:49:47.320]  I don't know how he did it
[2:49:47.320 --> 2:49:49.320]  And Joe's reading
[2:49:49.320 --> 2:49:51.320]  Scientific American had quotes
[2:49:51.320 --> 2:49:53.320]  From the Baltimore Sun
[2:49:53.320 --> 2:49:55.320]  About cell towers
[2:49:55.320 --> 2:49:56.320]  Mind-controlling people
[2:49:56.320 --> 2:49:59.320]  Look, I'm not the one saying this
[2:49:59.320 --> 2:50:01.320]  I read 23 years ago
[2:50:01.320 --> 2:50:02.320]  The BBC said
[2:50:02.320 --> 2:50:04.320]  We have human animal hybrids
[2:50:04.320 --> 2:50:05.320]  But we don't show them to you
[2:50:05.320 --> 2:50:07.320]  But that was a test balloon
[2:50:07.320 --> 2:50:09.320]  I've noticed they have these test balloons
[2:50:09.320 --> 2:50:11.320]  Where they report the most insane stuff
[2:50:11.320 --> 2:50:12.320]  So yes
[2:50:12.320 --> 2:50:14.320]  Like Dr. Dick Beggis explains
[2:50:14.320 --> 2:50:16.320]  And he's one of the top guys
[2:50:16.320 --> 2:50:17.320]  Brother, U.S. senator
[2:50:17.320 --> 2:50:18.320]  Dad, famous congressman
[2:50:18.320 --> 2:50:20.320]  That actually gave the land of Alaska
[2:50:20.320 --> 2:50:21.320]  Back to the people
[2:50:21.320 --> 2:50:22.320]  So they killed him
[2:50:22.320 --> 2:50:23.320]  With hellbugs
[2:50:23.320 --> 2:50:25.320]  He's a smart cookie
[2:50:25.320 --> 2:50:26.320]  But he'll say, Alex
[2:50:26.320 --> 2:50:27.320]  Don't worry about the fluoride
[2:50:27.320 --> 2:50:28.320]  Don't worry about the chemicals
[2:50:28.320 --> 2:50:29.320]  The vaccines, they're bad enough
[2:50:29.320 --> 2:50:31.320]  Because they're nothing compared
[2:50:31.320 --> 2:50:33.320]  To electromagnetic
[2:50:33.320 --> 2:50:35.320]  And so it's not that
[2:50:35.320 --> 2:50:37.320]  Magnetics and the atmosphere is bad
[2:50:37.320 --> 2:50:38.320]  The sun creates incredible ones
[2:50:38.320 --> 2:50:39.320]  Gives us sunburns
[2:50:39.320 --> 2:50:41.320]  It also grows our crops
[2:50:41.320 --> 2:50:43.320]  It's that we have developed
[2:50:43.320 --> 2:50:45.320]  Under God's control with the sun
[2:50:45.320 --> 2:50:47.320]  Over a long period of time
[2:50:47.320 --> 2:50:49.320]  They're creating all these other systems
[2:50:49.320 --> 2:50:51.320]  That nudge and manipulate
[2:50:51.320 --> 2:50:53.320]  So anything, just like
[2:50:53.320 --> 2:50:55.320]  My dad in the 60s, 1965
[2:50:55.320 --> 2:50:57.320]  He's a junior in high school
[2:50:57.320 --> 2:50:58.320]  Top of his class
[2:50:58.320 --> 2:50:59.320]  So they bring him to UT
[2:50:59.320 --> 2:51:02.320]  They've got virtual reality goggles
[2:51:02.320 --> 2:51:04.320]  They've got gloves
[2:51:04.320 --> 2:51:06.320]  You put on, it's virtual reality
[2:51:06.320 --> 2:51:08.320]  They've got CD-ROM
[2:51:08.320 --> 2:51:10.320]  This is stuff that didn't come out until the 90s
[2:51:10.320 --> 2:51:12.320]  I'm on Joe Rogan's show
[2:51:12.320 --> 2:51:14.320]  Jamie's so good
[2:51:14.320 --> 2:51:15.320]  His producer
[2:51:15.320 --> 2:51:17.320]  I've never even been able to find
[2:51:17.320 --> 2:51:19.320]  The patent that shows the VR goggles
[2:51:19.320 --> 2:51:20.320]  The ones that are sold in stores
[2:51:20.320 --> 2:51:22.320]  He finds it in 1955
[2:51:22.320 --> 2:51:24.320]  So my point is
[2:51:24.320 --> 2:51:26.320]  My dad thought he saw it first
[2:51:26.320 --> 2:51:28.320]  In a DARPA program in 65
[2:51:28.320 --> 2:51:30.320]  No, 10 years before, it's patented
[2:51:30.320 --> 2:51:32.320]  So anything we're given
[2:51:32.320 --> 2:51:35.320]  AirPods, iPhones, droids
[2:51:35.320 --> 2:51:36.320]  TV flicker rates
[2:51:36.320 --> 2:51:39.320]  They decide to give it to us
[2:51:39.320 --> 2:51:42.320]  With a system they can piggyback things on
[2:51:42.320 --> 2:51:44.320]  In fact, a lot of scientists say
[2:51:44.320 --> 2:51:46.320]  Why does the US and Europe have different flicker rates
[2:51:46.320 --> 2:51:47.320]  On TVs?
[2:51:47.320 --> 2:51:49.320]  And why are they not even the best for energy
[2:51:49.320 --> 2:51:50.320]  Or the best for visuals?
[2:51:50.320 --> 2:51:52.320]  Because they're the best for, quote
[2:51:52.320 --> 2:51:54.320]  Highly suggestibility
[2:51:54.320 --> 2:51:56.320]  They put you into a trance
[2:51:56.320 --> 2:51:58.320]  So people that are suggestible
[2:51:58.320 --> 2:52:00.320]  You wonder why the public looks so dumb
[2:52:00.320 --> 2:52:01.320]  Why they look so zombified
[2:52:01.320 --> 2:52:03.320]  Why they don't look conscious
[2:52:03.320 --> 2:52:05.320]  They've been put into a dream
[2:52:05.320 --> 2:52:07.320]  Into a dream trance
[2:52:07.320 --> 2:52:09.320]  And now they're being programmed
[2:52:09.320 --> 2:52:10.320]  To not reproduce
[2:52:10.320 --> 2:52:11.320]  To not be strong
[2:52:11.320 --> 2:52:13.320]  To not connect to God
[2:52:13.320 --> 2:52:15.320]  So you bring that up exactly
[2:52:15.320 --> 2:52:17.320]  I mean, I take my children's cell phones away
[2:52:17.320 --> 2:52:19.320]  I give them cell phones to go to a friend's house
[2:52:19.320 --> 2:52:21.320]  Or they're going to go on a field trip
[2:52:21.320 --> 2:52:22.320]  Or something
[2:52:22.320 --> 2:52:23.320]  I'm even taking that away
[2:52:23.320 --> 2:52:24.320]  Because they literally just beg
[2:52:24.320 --> 2:52:25.320]  And beg and beg
[2:52:25.320 --> 2:52:27.320]  And then act up after they've been given them
[2:52:27.320 --> 2:52:29.320]  And it's not that the cell phone itself would be evil
[2:52:29.320 --> 2:52:33.320]  It's that everything piggybacked on it is bad
[2:52:33.320 --> 2:52:35.320]  And has already been pre-tested
[2:52:35.320 --> 2:52:37.320]  We're not giving anything
[2:52:37.320 --> 2:52:39.320]  It took to the mid-2000s
[2:52:39.320 --> 2:52:41.320]  Until real VR goggles came out
[2:52:41.320 --> 2:52:45.320]  The exact patent was out in 55
[2:52:45.320 --> 2:52:48.320]  I mean, they had, my dad saw in the 60s
[2:52:48.320 --> 2:52:51.320]  TV screens that were paper thin
[2:52:51.320 --> 2:52:54.320]  And that you could fold up like a magazine
[2:52:54.320 --> 2:52:55.320]  And I didn't read about that
[2:52:55.320 --> 2:52:56.320]  Till the 90s in Wired Magazine
[2:52:56.320 --> 2:52:58.320]  Everything we've been given
[2:52:58.320 --> 2:53:00.320]  Is 30 to 40 years old, ladies and gentlemen
[2:53:00.320 --> 2:53:02.320]  Now, that's why the globalists are on such power trips
[2:53:02.320 --> 2:53:04.320]  They've already got life extension
[2:53:04.320 --> 2:53:06.320]  They can already keep you alive to 200, 300
[2:53:06.320 --> 2:53:08.320]  They're not going to give us that
[2:53:08.320 --> 2:53:11.320]  They've said, there's too many people
[2:53:11.320 --> 2:53:12.320]  The population is there
[2:53:12.320 --> 2:53:13.320]  We have to call the population
[2:53:13.320 --> 2:53:16.320]  Then a select group, like Moonraker
[2:53:16.320 --> 2:53:17.320]  Ian Fleming wrote about that
[2:53:17.320 --> 2:53:20.320]  Will then go on to build the new age
[2:53:20.320 --> 2:53:22.320]  And so this is why they're setting up
[2:53:22.320 --> 2:53:24.320]  This Luciferian system
[2:53:24.320 --> 2:53:25.320]  This is why they're doing it
[2:53:25.320 --> 2:53:26.320]  And here's the deal
[2:53:26.320 --> 2:53:28.320]  They're so threatened by men and women together
[2:53:28.320 --> 2:53:30.320]  Have a woman who wants to be president, great
[2:53:30.320 --> 2:53:32.320]  A woman wants to be a scientist, great
[2:53:32.320 --> 2:53:33.320]  Women are awesome
[2:53:33.320 --> 2:53:34.320]  I've got three daughters
[2:53:34.320 --> 2:53:35.320]  The point is, they're artificially
[2:53:35.320 --> 2:53:37.320]  Want women out of the household
[2:53:37.320 --> 2:53:38.320]  In the workforce
[2:53:38.320 --> 2:53:40.320]  So the children are raised by the state
[2:53:40.320 --> 2:53:43.320]  That's why Captain Marvel, just like Ghostbusters
[2:53:43.320 --> 2:53:45.320]  Is super unpopular, the new one
[2:53:45.320 --> 2:53:46.320]  And so they admit
[2:53:46.320 --> 2:53:48.320]  Rotten tomatoes used to be 90% against it
[2:53:48.320 --> 2:53:50.320]  Now it's 90% for
[2:53:50.320 --> 2:53:52.320]  That Google admits they rigged
[2:53:52.320 --> 2:53:56.320]  This feminist anti-family anti-woman program
[2:53:56.320 --> 2:53:57.320]  And it's right there
[2:53:57.320 --> 2:53:59.320]  They admit it's all rigged
[2:53:59.320 --> 2:54:00.320]  Everyone rejects it
[2:54:00.320 --> 2:54:02.320]  So they rig it and say you must see it
[2:54:02.320 --> 2:54:03.320]  Still people will reject it
[2:54:03.320 --> 2:54:05.320]  So they're trying to break
[2:54:05.320 --> 2:54:08.320]  The basic man-woman program
[2:54:08.320 --> 2:54:09.320]  Of our species
[2:54:09.320 --> 2:54:12.320]  Electromagnetically, chemically, biologically
[2:54:12.320 --> 2:54:14.320]  But it's not working on
[2:54:14.320 --> 2:54:17.320]  Well, and Alex, I just feel like
[2:54:17.320 --> 2:54:18.320]  To the average human out there
[2:54:18.320 --> 2:54:20.320]  That doesn't understand that this is all going on
[2:54:20.320 --> 2:54:22.320]  That's why they're trying to eliminate God
[2:54:22.320 --> 2:54:23.320]  From the school
[2:54:23.320 --> 2:54:24.320]  That's why they're trying to eliminate God
[2:54:24.320 --> 2:54:25.320]  From people's lives
[2:54:25.320 --> 2:54:27.320]  Because if you don't have that connection with God
[2:54:27.320 --> 2:54:29.320]  It's the highest program
[2:54:29.320 --> 2:54:30.320]  And here's the thing
[2:54:30.320 --> 2:54:32.320]  When humans know they're under attack and resist
[2:54:32.320 --> 2:54:33.320]  They get stronger
[2:54:33.320 --> 2:54:35.320]  When we don't know we're under attack
[2:54:35.320 --> 2:54:36.320]  And adapt to the attack
[2:54:36.320 --> 2:54:38.320]  To survive in the attack
[2:54:38.320 --> 2:54:39.320]  Long-term, we're killed
[2:54:39.320 --> 2:54:41.320]  That's a top globalist program
[2:54:41.320 --> 2:54:43.320]  So listen, be aware of the attack, folks
[2:54:43.320 --> 2:54:45.320]  We're not victims like the left
[2:54:45.320 --> 2:54:47.320]  One reason conservatives can't wake up
[2:54:47.320 --> 2:54:48.320]  As they go, I'm not a victim
[2:54:48.320 --> 2:54:49.320]  I'm just gonna adapt to the attack
[2:54:49.320 --> 2:54:50.320]  No, no, you're not a victim
[2:54:50.320 --> 2:54:51.320]  You're a target
[2:54:51.320 --> 2:54:52.320]  Like Tommy Robinson says
[2:54:52.320 --> 2:54:54.320]  So admit you're under attack
[2:54:54.320 --> 2:54:56.320]  Organize your brain to resist it
[2:54:56.320 --> 2:54:58.320]  And your brain will open up avenues
[2:54:58.320 --> 2:55:00.320]  And God will open up discernment pathways
[2:55:00.320 --> 2:55:04.320]  To battle, prefix, overhead, relays
[2:55:04.320 --> 2:55:06.320]  I'm telling you, folks, the enemy
[2:55:06.320 --> 2:55:08.320]  Is trying to implement what God already has
[2:55:08.320 --> 2:55:09.320]  You jack into God
[2:55:09.320 --> 2:55:10.320]  You say, God, I need help
[2:55:10.320 --> 2:55:11.320]  I love Jesus
[2:55:11.320 --> 2:55:13.320]  I want children to be free
[2:55:13.320 --> 2:55:14.320]  I want a human future
[2:55:14.320 --> 2:55:16.320]  I want to be guided by your program
[2:55:16.320 --> 2:55:17.320]  Then God comes in
[2:55:17.320 --> 2:55:20.320]  You have to say, Jesus, I want you
[2:55:20.320 --> 2:55:21.320]  God, I want you
[2:55:21.320 --> 2:55:22.320]  The God of the Bible
[2:55:22.320 --> 2:55:23.320]  The real God
[2:55:23.320 --> 2:55:24.320]  The God of life
[2:55:24.320 --> 2:55:25.320]  The God of Genesis
[2:55:25.320 --> 2:55:26.320]  The God of Revelation
[2:55:26.320 --> 2:55:27.320]  You ask God in
[2:55:27.320 --> 2:55:30.320]  This isn't something with fake preachers, folks
[2:55:30.320 --> 2:55:32.320]  This is literal interdimensional
[2:55:32.320 --> 2:55:34.320]  Then the real program comes in
[2:55:34.320 --> 2:55:36.320]  And then you can see the code
[2:55:36.320 --> 2:55:38.320]  Then you understand the whole enemy operation
[2:55:38.320 --> 2:55:40.320]  Now, you may go a little crazy
[2:55:40.320 --> 2:55:43.320]  But I'm telling you, imagine seeing the code, folks
[2:55:43.320 --> 2:55:45.320]  And many of you already see the code
[2:55:45.320 --> 2:55:46.320]  Many of you see the code better than I do
[2:55:46.320 --> 2:55:48.320]  God wants to give you the full code right now
[2:55:48.320 --> 2:55:51.320]  But he's only gonna give you what you can take
[2:55:51.320 --> 2:55:54.320]  And Alex, I just sit here
[2:55:54.320 --> 2:55:56.320]  Like, wow, of course the average human thinks
[2:55:56.320 --> 2:55:58.320]  The liberal progressive agenda is good
[2:55:58.320 --> 2:55:59.320]  And it's loving
[2:55:59.320 --> 2:56:01.320]  And they're calling humans into just falling for it
[2:56:01.320 --> 2:56:02.320]  No, it's all anti-human
[2:56:02.320 --> 2:56:04.320]  It's all anti-human, it's all pure death
[2:56:04.320 --> 2:56:06.320]  All the metrics, all the numbers
[2:56:06.320 --> 2:56:08.320]  If you had a dashboard of what liberalism
[2:56:08.320 --> 2:56:10.320]  And globalism does, it's anti-human
[2:56:10.320 --> 2:56:12.320]  It's pure death, it's pure failure
[2:56:12.320 --> 2:56:15.320]  So what happens next, Alex, as the panel
[2:56:15.320 --> 2:56:19.320]  Involved in getting the Epstein
[2:56:19.320 --> 2:56:21.320]  Sex trafficking case documents unsealed
[2:56:21.320 --> 2:56:22.320]  Has moved to do it
[2:56:22.320 --> 2:56:25.320]  I mean, are people gonna come and apologize to Alex Jones
[2:56:25.320 --> 2:56:27.320]  And say, wow, Alex, you were right
[2:56:27.320 --> 2:56:30.320]  They're protecting pedophiles at the highest levels
[2:56:30.320 --> 2:56:33.320]  Well, I mean, listen, Robert Mueller protected Epstein
[2:56:33.320 --> 2:56:35.320]  Using for 10 years as a confidential informant
[2:56:35.320 --> 2:56:37.320]  That came out in the federal documents
[2:56:37.320 --> 2:56:39.320]  That were released five years ago
[2:56:39.320 --> 2:56:41.320]  And in the news spot that I said, Mueller raped the kids
[2:56:41.320 --> 2:56:43.320]  Notice how they always lie
[2:56:43.320 --> 2:56:45.320]  No, I said, Mueller doesn't rape the kids
[2:56:45.320 --> 2:56:47.320]  He videotaped it
[2:56:47.320 --> 2:56:48.320]  That came out
[2:56:48.320 --> 2:56:51.320]  So this high level of what's going on
[2:56:51.320 --> 2:56:53.320]  Obviously, Alan Dershowitz was not involved
[2:56:53.320 --> 2:56:54.320]  In any of this
[2:56:54.320 --> 2:56:55.320]  And it was Trump
[2:56:55.320 --> 2:56:59.320]  That's why through Dershowitz, Trump wants it all released
[2:56:59.320 --> 2:57:01.320]  When you hear about Dershowitz wanting it all released
[2:57:01.320 --> 2:57:02.320]  That's Trump
[2:57:02.320 --> 2:57:04.320]  They have nothing to do with Epstein
[2:57:04.320 --> 2:57:05.320]  Other than, you know, New York parties
[2:57:05.320 --> 2:57:07.320]  And say, oh, yeah, great, yeah, I know him
[2:57:07.320 --> 2:57:09.320]  And so it's the Democrats
[2:57:09.320 --> 2:57:11.320]  Hundreds of flights on the airplane
[2:57:11.320 --> 2:57:12.320]  It's Harvey Weinstein
[2:57:12.320 --> 2:57:14.320]  It's all these people
[2:57:14.320 --> 2:57:16.320]  I mean, take...
[2:57:16.320 --> 2:57:20.320]  Who was the guy that did the Kevin Spacey House of Cards?
[2:57:20.320 --> 2:57:23.320]  They're trying to flush him for low level stuff
[2:57:23.320 --> 2:57:25.320]  And so the real stuff he was involved with
[2:57:25.320 --> 2:57:26.320]  It's all coming down
[2:57:26.320 --> 2:57:28.320]  We'll come back in two minutes and finish this up
[2:57:28.320 --> 2:57:29.320]  And then there's more coming up
[2:57:29.320 --> 2:57:31.320]  In FullWars.com tomorrow's news today
[2:57:31.320 --> 2:57:33.320]  The enemy hopes you don't spread those links
[2:57:33.320 --> 2:57:35.320]  You spread those links, we smash the enemy
[2:57:35.320 --> 2:57:36.320]  You don't spread those links
[2:57:36.320 --> 2:57:38.320]  The globalists win
[2:57:38.320 --> 2:57:39.320]  Stay with us
[2:57:45.320 --> 2:57:47.320]  I've got some really good news, though
[2:57:47.320 --> 2:57:50.320]  X2 is back, the original X2
[2:57:50.320 --> 2:57:53.320]  Deep Earth Crystal, pure atomic iodine
[2:57:53.320 --> 2:57:55.320]  What you want, in FullWars.com
[2:57:55.320 --> 2:57:57.320]  It'll be here in a week
[2:57:57.320 --> 2:57:59.320]  Manufactured in the US, in FullWars.com
[2:57:59.320 --> 2:58:01.320]  With the best iodine in the world
[2:58:01.320 --> 2:58:02.320]  X2, it's available
[2:58:02.320 --> 2:58:03.320]  I thought X3 is great
[2:58:03.320 --> 2:58:05.320]  We still got another Deep Earth Crystal source
[2:58:05.320 --> 2:58:07.320]  But I thought, add the other two types of iodine
[2:58:07.320 --> 2:58:08.320]  The scientists that do that
[2:58:08.320 --> 2:58:11.320]  It sold a lot that people want original X2
[2:58:11.320 --> 2:58:13.320]  I was resigned the fact we didn't have X2
[2:58:13.320 --> 2:58:15.320]  But it came through about a month ago
[2:58:15.320 --> 2:58:17.320]  We now have X2 again
[2:58:17.320 --> 2:58:19.320]  At FullWars.com, so hallelujah
[2:58:19.320 --> 2:58:21.320]  It's been sold out for about almost three months
[2:58:21.320 --> 2:58:24.320]  But we have now had the same company
[2:58:24.320 --> 2:58:26.320]  The original X2
[2:58:26.320 --> 2:58:28.320]  Develop it again
[2:58:28.320 --> 2:58:31.320]  And we were able to do the exact same formula
[2:58:31.320 --> 2:58:34.320]  We want to pre-order X2, the ultimate iodine out there

[2:58:43.320 --> 2:58:47.320]  Our grandparents, our great grandparents
[2:58:47.320 --> 2:58:49.320]  They can't food during the fall
[2:58:49.320 --> 2:58:51.320]  So they have it during the winter
[2:58:51.320 --> 2:58:53.320]  And that's what I'm talking about

[2:59:43.320 --> 2:59:45.320]  Powered by my patriot supply
[2:59:48.320 --> 2:59:51.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:00:03.320 --> 3:00:05.320]  The thing they hate the most about Infowars folks
[3:00:05.320 --> 3:00:07.320]  It's really not our political coverage
[3:00:07.320 --> 3:00:09.320]  Our political coverage is just
[3:00:09.320 --> 3:00:12.320]  A method of exposing the Satanists
[3:00:12.320 --> 3:00:14.320]  And devil trying to destroy humanity
[3:00:14.320 --> 3:00:16.320]  And us trying to channel God
[3:00:16.320 --> 3:00:18.320]  And get you in touch with God, Alex
[3:00:18.320 --> 3:00:21.320]  That's what they really hate
[3:00:21.320 --> 3:00:23.320]  Well, you're absolutely right
[3:00:23.320 --> 3:00:26.320]  And God wants humanity
[3:00:26.320 --> 3:00:29.320]  To ask for the blueprints to Satan's plan
[3:00:29.320 --> 3:00:30.320]  So that we can stop it
[3:00:30.320 --> 3:00:32.320]  Because God is a free will God
[3:00:32.320 --> 3:00:33.320]  And it's the true God
[3:00:33.320 --> 3:00:34.320]  The one God
[3:00:34.320 --> 3:00:35.320]  And that's what this comes down to
[3:00:35.320 --> 3:00:37.320]  Is that literally
[3:00:37.320 --> 3:00:39.320]  The enemy blueprint is in front of us
[3:00:39.320 --> 3:00:40.320]  It's an anti-human blueprint
[3:00:40.320 --> 3:00:42.320]  It's a woodchipping machine
[3:00:42.320 --> 3:00:43.320]  To destroy all of us
[3:00:43.320 --> 3:00:44.320]  And we must stand against it
[3:00:44.320 --> 3:00:45.320]  And I'm glad you're pointing that out
[3:00:45.320 --> 3:00:48.320]  Because covering all the politics
[3:00:48.320 --> 3:00:50.320]  Is only a way to show people the enemy's design
[3:00:50.320 --> 3:00:53.320]  It is a good versus evil paradigm
[3:00:53.320 --> 3:00:55.320]  That's what it comes down to
[3:00:55.320 --> 3:00:58.320]  Why would the left channel
[3:00:58.320 --> 3:01:00.320]  Even when I've been on vacation for five days
[3:01:00.320 --> 3:01:01.320]  At this particular hotel
[3:01:01.320 --> 3:01:03.320]  They have like a gay wedding here
[3:01:03.320 --> 3:01:05.320]  And you've got a bunch of Muslims here
[3:01:05.320 --> 3:01:06.320]  At the same time
[3:01:06.320 --> 3:01:07.320]  Who are sitting there
[3:01:07.320 --> 3:01:08.320]  With their women wearing burkas
[3:01:08.320 --> 3:01:09.320]  And then hajibs
[3:01:09.320 --> 3:01:12.320]  And looking disgustingly at these gay men
[3:01:12.320 --> 3:01:14.320]  And the gay men all kissing their ass
[3:01:14.320 --> 3:01:15.320]  Right next to them
[3:01:15.320 --> 3:01:16.320]  And you just have to understand
[3:01:16.320 --> 3:01:18.320]  That's two cultures that don't even get along
[3:01:18.320 --> 3:01:21.320]  But aren't even on the same wavelength
[3:01:21.320 --> 3:01:23.320]  Except they're both destructive
[3:01:23.320 --> 3:01:25.320]  And the left is trying to bring all this in
[3:01:25.320 --> 3:01:27.320]  They're trying to set all this up
[3:01:27.320 --> 3:01:28.320]  They're trying to do this
[3:01:28.320 --> 3:01:30.320]  There's other article on infowars.com
[3:01:30.320 --> 3:01:31.320]  In Germany
[3:01:31.320 --> 3:01:33.320]  Where the woman's murdered by a Muslim
[3:01:33.320 --> 3:01:35.320]  So a Muslim goes to the wedding
[3:01:35.320 --> 3:01:36.320]  I mean goes to the funeral
[3:01:36.320 --> 3:01:37.320]  This is a wedding of death
[3:01:37.320 --> 3:01:39.320]  And screams Allah Akbar
[3:01:39.320 --> 3:01:41.320]  And it was mentioned in YouTube
[3:01:41.320 --> 3:01:44.320]  Sensoring bad reviews of leftist movies
[3:01:44.320 --> 3:01:46.320]  I mean this is where they're going
[3:01:46.320 --> 3:01:47.320]  I didn't even get into this
[3:01:47.320 --> 3:01:49.320]  I'll cover it with you obviously tomorrow
[3:01:49.320 --> 3:01:50.320]  And Paul Watson
[3:01:50.320 --> 3:01:52.320]  I'll be back tomorrow
[3:01:52.320 --> 3:01:54.320]  But I've got to deal with the depositions
[3:01:54.320 --> 3:01:55.320]  AOC
[3:01:55.320 --> 3:01:57.320]  Saying America's garbage
[3:01:57.320 --> 3:01:59.320]  You can't fix capitalism
[3:01:59.320 --> 3:02:01.320]  Well then move to Venezuela
[3:02:01.320 --> 3:02:02.320]  But it's bigger than that
[3:02:02.320 --> 3:02:03.320]  Yes she wears his honor clothes
[3:02:03.320 --> 3:02:05.320]  Yes she flies in private jets
[3:02:05.320 --> 3:02:07.320]  Yes she wears all these fancy outfits
[3:02:07.320 --> 3:02:09.320]  And drives around in the SUVs
[3:02:09.320 --> 3:02:11.320]  It's about she's a god
[3:02:11.320 --> 3:02:12.320]  And you're a slave
[3:02:12.320 --> 3:02:13.320]  And it's about flaunting it
[3:02:13.320 --> 3:02:15.320]  And breaking your will
[3:02:15.320 --> 3:02:16.320]  But the good news is
[3:02:16.320 --> 3:02:18.320]  Her corruption is boiled over
[3:02:18.320 --> 3:02:20.320]  And the Justice Department
[3:02:20.320 --> 3:02:22.320]  Isn't under full Democrat control
[3:02:22.320 --> 3:02:23.320]  You know in the past
[3:02:23.320 --> 3:02:25.320]  An AOC
[3:02:25.320 --> 3:02:26.320]  Like a Maxine water
[3:02:26.320 --> 3:02:28.320]  She's an older AOC
[3:02:28.320 --> 3:02:30.320]  And steal hundreds of millions of dollars
[3:02:30.320 --> 3:02:32.320]  Give tens of millions to her husband's
[3:02:32.320 --> 3:02:33.320]  Failed bank directly
[3:02:33.320 --> 3:02:35.320]  Because they control the Justice Department
[3:02:35.320 --> 3:02:36.320]  That's why they're so scared
[3:02:36.320 --> 3:02:37.320]  Is their CHICOM deals
[3:02:37.320 --> 3:02:38.320]  And their money laundering
[3:02:38.320 --> 3:02:40.320]  And their banker bailouts
[3:02:40.320 --> 3:02:41.320]  And the scams they've run
[3:02:41.320 --> 3:02:42.320]  Are coming to an end
[3:02:42.320 --> 3:02:43.320]  And so here she is keeping
[3:02:43.320 --> 3:02:44.320]  Millions of dollars
[3:02:44.320 --> 3:02:45.320]  Not a million
[3:02:45.320 --> 3:02:46.320]  Millions of dollars
[3:02:46.320 --> 3:02:47.320]  Of 18 million she got
[3:02:47.320 --> 3:02:49.320]  Not declaring she's in a pack
[3:02:49.320 --> 3:02:51.320]  Not declaring she kept the money
[3:02:51.320 --> 3:02:53.320]  Not declaring it's paying for her house or car
[3:02:53.320 --> 3:02:54.320]  Meanwhile
[3:02:54.320 --> 3:02:56.320]  Number two documentary filmmaker in history
[3:02:56.320 --> 3:02:58.320]  Give 20-something thousand to friends
[3:02:58.320 --> 3:03:00.320]  To give to a senate campaign
[3:03:00.320 --> 3:03:01.320]  Technically illegal
[3:03:01.320 --> 3:03:02.320]  Didn't fill out the paperwork
[3:03:02.320 --> 3:03:04.320]  He goes to jail for nine months
[3:03:04.320 --> 3:03:06.320]  He's on probation for two years
[3:03:06.320 --> 3:03:07.320]  The National Susan
[3:03:07.320 --> 3:03:09.320]  She does nothing in the same
[3:03:09.320 --> 3:03:10.320]  State of New York
[3:03:10.320 --> 3:03:12.320]  But we're gonna continue to
[3:03:12.320 --> 3:03:13.320]  Expose this hypocrisy
[3:03:13.320 --> 3:03:14.320]  And that's what's so key
[3:03:14.320 --> 3:03:16.320]  So oh and I salute you
[3:03:16.320 --> 3:03:18.320]  And I thank you
[3:03:18.320 --> 3:03:19.320]  You know I didn't get to power
[3:03:19.320 --> 3:03:20.320]  Versus character
[3:03:20.320 --> 3:03:22.320]  But there's no time to get to that now
[3:03:22.320 --> 3:03:24.320]  But I'm gonna take something
[3:03:24.320 --> 3:03:26.320]  For tomorrow's show
[3:03:26.320 --> 3:03:27.320]  Power versus character
[3:03:27.320 --> 3:03:29.320]  Power is just raw power
[3:03:29.320 --> 3:03:30.320]  To burn something down
[3:03:30.320 --> 3:03:31.320]  What is character?
[3:03:31.320 --> 3:03:33.320]  Character means you have a program
[3:03:33.320 --> 3:03:34.320]  That perseveres
[3:03:34.320 --> 3:03:35.320]  That you're actually committed to
[3:03:35.320 --> 3:03:37.320]  And that you are an individual
[3:03:37.320 --> 3:03:39.320]  Tied into something greater
[3:03:39.320 --> 3:03:41.320]  Carrying out a larger operation
[3:03:41.320 --> 3:03:42.320]  And it's a character
[3:03:42.320 --> 3:03:43.320]  Real character
[3:03:43.320 --> 3:03:44.320]  Good character
[3:03:44.320 --> 3:03:45.320]  Not evil character
[3:03:45.320 --> 3:03:46.320]  This is actually a point out
[3:03:46.320 --> 3:03:47.320]  But it's bad character
[3:03:47.320 --> 3:03:48.320]  And good character
[3:03:48.320 --> 3:03:49.320]  It's like evil people
[3:03:49.320 --> 3:03:50.320]  Will go out of their way
[3:03:50.320 --> 3:03:51.320]  To screw somebody over
[3:03:51.320 --> 3:03:53.320]  Even if it would help them
[3:03:53.320 --> 3:03:54.320]  In their term
[3:03:54.320 --> 3:03:55.320]  In the long term
[3:03:55.320 --> 3:03:56.320]  To do something good
[3:03:56.320 --> 3:03:57.320]  They can't do good
[3:03:57.320 --> 3:03:59.320]  Because their character is evil
[3:03:59.320 --> 3:04:00.320]  Well those of us
[3:04:00.320 --> 3:04:02.320]  Whose character is good
[3:04:02.320 --> 3:04:03.320]  We have this tendency
[3:04:03.320 --> 3:04:04.320]  We don't want to be arrogant
[3:04:04.320 --> 3:04:06.320]  We have this tendency to
[3:04:06.320 --> 3:04:07.320]  Think that it's arrogant
[3:04:07.320 --> 3:04:08.320]  If we're leaders
[3:04:08.320 --> 3:04:09.320]  That we're trying to
[3:04:09.320 --> 3:04:10.320]  Force our way to the front
[3:04:10.320 --> 3:04:11.320]  No
[3:04:11.320 --> 3:04:12.320]  We're not looking for power
[3:04:12.320 --> 3:04:13.320]  We already built the planet
[3:04:13.320 --> 3:04:14.320]  Built the country
[3:04:14.320 --> 3:04:16.320]  Built everything with God's help
[3:04:16.320 --> 3:04:17.320]  Remained the image of God
[3:04:17.320 --> 3:04:19.320]  And so it's absolutely imperative
[3:04:19.320 --> 3:04:20.320]  And it's time
[3:04:20.320 --> 3:04:22.320]  That we realize the big picture
[3:04:22.320 --> 3:04:24.320]  And decide which side we're on
[3:04:24.320 --> 3:04:26.320]  So I'm going to throw this back to you
[3:04:26.320 --> 3:04:27.320]  The great job you're doing
[3:04:27.320 --> 3:04:28.320]  I want to just encourage everybody
[3:04:28.320 --> 3:04:29.320]  To remember
[3:04:29.320 --> 3:04:30.320]  Without your financial help
[3:04:30.320 --> 3:04:31.320]  Getting a t-shirt
[3:04:31.320 --> 3:04:32.320]  Getting a book
[3:04:32.320 --> 3:04:33.320]  Getting a film
[3:04:33.320 --> 3:04:34.320]  We will not be here
[3:04:34.320 --> 3:04:35.320]  In FullWarStore.com
[3:04:35.320 --> 3:04:36.320]  God bless you
[3:04:36.320 --> 3:04:37.320]  Back to Owen
[3:04:37.320 --> 3:04:38.320]  And the fourth hour host
[3:04:38.320 --> 3:04:39.320]  To get more
[3:04:39.320 --> 3:04:40.320]  Again, I'll be back tomorrow
[3:04:40.320 --> 3:04:41.320]  With Owen Polwatch
[3:04:41.320 --> 3:04:42.320]  And more
[3:04:42.320 --> 3:04:43.320]  Thank you
[3:04:43.320 --> 3:04:44.320]  Alright ladies and gentlemen
[3:04:44.320 --> 3:04:45.320]  There goes Alex Jones
[3:04:45.320 --> 3:04:46.320]  He'll be back with us tomorrow
[3:04:46.320 --> 3:04:47.320]  Paul Joseph Watson
[3:04:47.320 --> 3:04:49.320]  Takes over the Alex Jones show now
[3:04:49.320 --> 3:04:50.320]  Before the war room starts

[3:04:56.320 --> 3:04:57.320]  And it's not like
[3:04:57.320 --> 3:04:58.320]  We're selling stuff
[3:04:58.320 --> 3:04:59.320]  You don't need
[3:04:59.320 --> 3:05:00.320]  You don't want
[3:05:00.320 --> 3:05:01.320]  The air in the average
[3:05:01.320 --> 3:05:02.320]  American home
[3:05:02.320 --> 3:05:03.320]  Is filled with toxins
[3:05:03.320 --> 3:05:05.320]  That put it on par
[3:05:05.320 --> 3:05:07.320]  With a major city
[3:05:07.320 --> 3:05:08.320]  There's some of the most
[3:05:08.320 --> 3:05:09.320]  Polluted areas on earth
[3:05:09.320 --> 3:05:10.320]  Are major cities
[3:05:10.320 --> 3:05:12.320]  How can I solve that problem
[3:05:12.320 --> 3:05:14.320]  So we have air filters
[3:05:14.320 --> 3:05:15.320]  At infowarstore.com
[3:05:15.320 --> 3:05:16.320]  The Alexa Pure Breeze

[3:05:25.320 --> 3:05:27.320]  And we've got a limited quantity
[3:05:27.320 --> 3:05:28.320]  Of these left right now
[3:05:28.320 --> 3:05:30.320]  We're basically selling these at cost

[3:05:46.320 --> 3:05:48.320]  In a polluted major city
[3:05:48.320 --> 3:05:49.320]  In your home

[3:05:50.320 --> 3:06:16.320]  Go to infowarstore.com
[3:06:16.320 --> 3:06:21.320]  Be alive on the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show
[3:06:21.320 --> 3:06:24.320]  Right as the latest round of Brexit votes
[3:06:24.320 --> 3:06:27.320]  Is happening in the UK Parliament
[3:06:27.320 --> 3:06:29.320]  Of course I've been saying for months
[3:06:29.320 --> 3:06:31.320]  That Brexit is not going to happen
[3:06:31.320 --> 3:06:33.320]  It's been a planned sabotage
[3:06:33.320 --> 3:06:34.320]  From the very beginning
[3:06:34.320 --> 3:06:35.320]  So last night
[3:06:35.320 --> 3:06:37.320]  Basically the Prime Minister
[3:06:37.320 --> 3:06:38.320]  Of the UK Theresa May
[3:06:38.320 --> 3:06:40.320]  Went to the EU once again
[3:06:40.320 --> 3:06:42.320]  With no foundation
[3:06:42.320 --> 3:06:44.320]  For any negotiation whatsoever
[3:06:44.320 --> 3:06:46.320]  She's already basically ruled out no deal
[3:06:46.320 --> 3:06:48.320]  So she holds no cards whatsoever
[3:06:48.320 --> 3:06:50.320]  In this entire process
[3:06:50.320 --> 3:06:52.320]  Because she's a globalist
[3:06:52.320 --> 3:06:53.320]  Who planned to sabotage the deal
[3:06:53.320 --> 3:06:55.320]  From the very beginning
[3:06:55.320 --> 3:06:57.320]  So she went to Yonker
[3:06:57.320 --> 3:06:58.320]  She went to the EU
[3:06:58.320 --> 3:07:00.320]  And tried to get assurances
[3:07:00.320 --> 3:07:02.320]  That the United Kingdom would not
[3:07:02.320 --> 3:07:04.320]  Remain in the customs union
[3:07:04.320 --> 3:07:06.320]  Going forward as this supposed
[3:07:06.320 --> 3:07:09.320]  New trade deal with the EU was worked out
[3:07:09.320 --> 3:07:12.320]  And after the UK officially left the EU
[3:07:12.320 --> 3:07:14.320]  Which was initially planned to happen
[3:07:14.320 --> 3:07:16.320]  On the 29th of March
[3:07:16.320 --> 3:07:18.320]  Now she came back after that meeting
[3:07:18.320 --> 3:07:20.320]  And said that she'd got legally binding assurance
[3:07:20.320 --> 3:07:24.320]  That the UK would not remain in the customs union
[3:07:24.320 --> 3:07:26.320]  As a result of the hard border
[3:07:26.320 --> 3:07:28.320]  On the island of Ireland
[3:07:28.320 --> 3:07:30.320]  She presented that publicly
[3:07:30.320 --> 3:07:32.320]  And she lied once again
[3:07:32.320 --> 3:07:34.320]  Because the QC there
[3:07:34.320 --> 3:07:36.320]  Studied it, the Attorney General in the UK
[3:07:36.320 --> 3:07:37.320]  Studied it and said
[3:07:37.320 --> 3:07:39.320]  This is not legally binding
[3:07:39.320 --> 3:07:41.320]  Basically the UK would have to go
[3:07:41.320 --> 3:07:43.320]  Again begging to the EU
[3:07:43.320 --> 3:07:45.320]  To be let out of the European Union
[3:07:45.320 --> 3:07:48.320]  It wasn't legally binding agreement
[3:07:48.320 --> 3:07:51.320]  That became widely known
[3:07:51.320 --> 3:07:53.320]  In the hours after she announced it
[3:07:53.320 --> 3:07:55.320]  And lied to the British public once again
[3:07:55.320 --> 3:07:57.320]  Now they're having the vote on whether
[3:07:57.320 --> 3:07:59.320]  To accept that Brexit deal
[3:07:59.320 --> 3:08:01.320]  And she's gonna lose the vote once again
[3:08:01.320 --> 3:08:03.320]  By as many as 100 votes
[3:08:03.320 --> 3:08:05.320]  And she's still probably
[3:08:05.320 --> 3:08:08.320]  Going to remain in power unbelievably
[3:08:08.320 --> 3:08:10.320]  There's another vote tomorrow
[3:08:10.320 --> 3:08:12.320]  I believe on whether there's
[3:08:12.320 --> 3:08:14.320]  To take no deal off the table
[3:08:14.320 --> 3:08:16.320]  Again
[3:08:16.320 --> 3:08:18.320]  When we voted to leave the European Union
[3:08:18.320 --> 3:08:20.320]  It was a straight direct question
[3:08:20.320 --> 3:08:22.320]  Do you want to leave the European Union?
[3:08:22.320 --> 3:08:24.320]  It wasn't do you want no deal?
[3:08:24.320 --> 3:08:26.320]  Do you want a deal? It was to leave the European Union
[3:08:26.320 --> 3:08:29.320]  The best situation for the United Kingdom
[3:08:29.320 --> 3:08:31.320]  To forge itself going forward
[3:08:31.320 --> 3:08:33.320]  And to make new trade deals would to leave
[3:08:33.320 --> 3:08:35.320]  On the 29th of March with no deal
[3:08:35.320 --> 3:08:38.320]  We'd save $39 billion
[3:08:38.320 --> 3:08:40.320]  Theresa May and the Conservatives
[3:08:40.320 --> 3:08:42.320]  Would save political face
[3:08:42.320 --> 3:08:44.320]  But again they don't care about that
[3:08:44.320 --> 3:08:46.320]  Because the majority of them are Eurofiles
[3:08:46.320 --> 3:08:48.320]  And want to stay in the European Union
[3:08:48.320 --> 3:08:50.320]  They want to override the democratic will
[3:08:50.320 --> 3:08:54.320]  Of 17.4 million British people
[3:08:54.320 --> 3:08:56.320]  Who voted to leave the European Union
[3:08:56.320 --> 3:08:58.320]  So they're gonna have a vote on that
[3:08:58.320 --> 3:09:00.320]  It's taking place right now actually
[3:09:00.320 --> 3:09:02.320]  She's gonna lose it
[3:09:02.320 --> 3:09:04.320]  Then they're gonna have a vote on delaying
[3:09:04.320 --> 3:09:06.320]  The Brexit negotiations
[3:09:06.320 --> 3:09:08.320]  The date on which we leave once again
[3:09:08.320 --> 3:09:10.320]  So that will probably go through
[3:09:10.320 --> 3:09:13.320]  The vote to take no deal off the table again
[3:09:13.320 --> 3:09:16.320]  Betraying the vast majority
[3:09:16.320 --> 3:09:19.320]  Of the people who voted for leave
[3:09:19.320 --> 3:09:21.320]  That will probably pass
[3:09:21.320 --> 3:09:23.320]  So they'll take no deal off the table
[3:09:23.320 --> 3:09:25.320]  Then Theresa May once again
[3:09:25.320 --> 3:09:27.320]  Will have to go begging to the European Union
[3:09:27.320 --> 3:09:31.320]  Cap in hand for another crappy deal
[3:09:31.320 --> 3:09:33.320]  So we'll continue to monitor that
[3:09:33.320 --> 3:09:35.320]  Jacob Rees-Margo of course is
[3:09:35.320 --> 3:09:37.320]  One of the senior Brexiteers
[3:09:37.320 --> 3:09:39.320]  In the Conservative Party
[3:09:39.320 --> 3:09:41.320]  Says he will be voting against the deal
[3:09:41.320 --> 3:09:43.320]  He told the press association
[3:09:43.320 --> 3:09:45.320]  I'll be voting against the government this evening
[3:09:45.320 --> 3:09:47.320]  I expect the majority of the ERG
[3:09:47.320 --> 3:09:51.320]  Which is the pro-Brexiteer European
[3:09:51.320 --> 3:09:54.320]  Research Group will vote against the deal
[3:09:54.320 --> 3:09:56.320]  So it's not gonna pass
[3:09:56.320 --> 3:09:57.320]  Said from the start
[3:09:57.320 --> 3:09:59.320]  They're gonna delay Brexit to the point
[3:09:59.320 --> 3:10:01.320]  Where it becomes untenable to leave
[3:10:01.320 --> 3:10:03.320]  That was the plan from the very beginning
[3:10:03.320 --> 3:10:05.320]  Even if by some miracle
[3:10:05.320 --> 3:10:07.320]  Now we do leave the European Union
[3:10:07.320 --> 3:10:09.320]  They'll make it so horrific
[3:10:09.320 --> 3:10:11.320]  That we'll just be forced to rejoin
[3:10:11.320 --> 3:10:12.320]  Within two years
[3:10:12.320 --> 3:10:13.320]  And that's the example
[3:10:13.320 --> 3:10:15.320]  As the President of the EU said
[3:10:15.320 --> 3:10:17.320]  I think it was the President last night
[3:10:17.320 --> 3:10:19.320]  That they want to use the United Kingdom
[3:10:19.320 --> 3:10:21.320]  As the example
[3:10:21.320 --> 3:10:23.320]  On what happens when
[3:10:23.320 --> 3:10:25.320]  Countries try to leave this
[3:10:25.320 --> 3:10:27.320]  Authoritarian bureaucracy
[3:10:27.320 --> 3:10:29.320]  So if you make it as hard as possible
[3:10:29.320 --> 3:10:31.320]  If you make it as painful as possible
[3:10:31.320 --> 3:10:33.320]  All these other Eurosceptic forces
[3:10:33.320 --> 3:10:35.320]  Throughout Europe which are growing
[3:10:35.320 --> 3:10:37.320]  Will even want to consider
[3:10:37.320 --> 3:10:39.320]  Their countries leaving the European Union
[3:10:39.320 --> 3:10:41.320]  So it's all about the threat of a good example
[3:10:41.320 --> 3:10:43.320]  And it's about punishing countries
[3:10:43.320 --> 3:10:45.320]  Who try to leave this
[3:10:45.320 --> 3:10:48.320]  Byzantine authoritarian bureaucracy
[3:10:48.320 --> 3:10:50.320]  So we'll continue to monitor that
[3:10:50.320 --> 3:10:51.320]  As it comes in
[3:10:51.320 --> 3:10:53.320]  But it's almost certain that you'll lose the vote
[3:10:53.320 --> 3:10:55.320]  And by a good 100 votes
[3:10:55.320 --> 3:10:57.320]  At least probably
[3:10:57.320 --> 3:10:58.320]  Now
[3:10:58.320 --> 3:11:00.320]  President Trump has come out
[3:11:00.320 --> 3:11:02.320]  Today in a bright bar interview
[3:11:02.320 --> 3:11:04.320]  On the subject of big tech
[3:11:04.320 --> 3:11:06.320]  Headlined Donald Trump accuses
[3:11:06.320 --> 3:11:08.320]  Tech giants of colluding with Democrats
[3:11:08.320 --> 3:11:10.320]  President Donald Trump accuses companies
[3:11:10.320 --> 3:11:12.320]  Like Facebook, Twitter and Google of colluding
[3:11:12.320 --> 3:11:14.320]  With Democrats that censor his supporters
[3:11:14.320 --> 3:11:16.320]  Online to their political advantage
[3:11:16.320 --> 3:11:18.320]  Trump said quote
[3:11:18.320 --> 3:11:20.320]  Actually it's incredible I won the election
[3:11:20.320 --> 3:11:22.320]  Because you know it was so rigged against me
[3:11:22.320 --> 3:11:24.320]  It wasn't Russians, Russia collusion
[3:11:24.320 --> 3:11:26.320]  Collusion was a delusion
[3:11:26.320 --> 3:11:28.320]  But what there is is there was collusion
[3:11:28.320 --> 3:11:30.320]  With Democrats and these tech companies
[3:11:30.320 --> 3:11:32.320]  Which is right
[3:11:32.320 --> 3:11:34.320]  And he's right to say that
[3:11:34.320 --> 3:11:36.320]  He went on to say Twitter's horrible
[3:11:36.320 --> 3:11:38.320]  What they're doing to people, they're blanking them out
[3:11:38.320 --> 3:11:40.320]  What's going on with Twitter is terrible for conservatives
[3:11:40.320 --> 3:11:42.320]  Of course last night we had
[3:11:42.320 --> 3:11:44.320]  Zero hedge which is one of the biggest
[3:11:44.320 --> 3:11:46.320]  Non-corporate
[3:11:46.320 --> 3:11:48.320]  News websites on the internet
[3:11:48.320 --> 3:11:50.320]  Be directly censored by Facebook
[3:11:50.320 --> 3:11:52.320]  Their accounts weren't removed
[3:11:52.320 --> 3:11:54.320]  They've removed the ability for anyone to post
[3:11:54.320 --> 3:11:56.320]  A link
[3:11:56.320 --> 3:11:58.320]  To a zero hedge article on Facebook
[3:11:58.320 --> 3:12:00.320]  From what I checked
[3:12:00.320 --> 3:12:02.320]  As of a couple of hours ago that is now being
[3:12:02.320 --> 3:12:04.320]  Corrected they've flipped it back
[3:12:04.320 --> 3:12:06.320]  And you can actually post zero hedge articles on Facebook
[3:12:06.320 --> 3:12:08.320]  That is another chilling insight
[3:12:08.320 --> 3:12:10.320]  As to where they're going to go next
[3:12:10.320 --> 3:12:12.320]  Outright banning URLs
[3:12:12.320 --> 3:12:14.320]  Completely
[3:12:14.320 --> 3:12:16.320]  To completely legitimate
[3:12:16.320 --> 3:12:18.320]  Non-corporate news websites
[3:12:18.320 --> 3:12:20.320]  Which gets millions of millions of viewers every day
[3:12:20.320 --> 3:12:22.320]  But here's the problem
[3:12:22.320 --> 3:12:24.320]  With what Trump said to Breitbart
[3:12:24.320 --> 3:12:26.320]  He was asked by Breitbart
[3:12:26.320 --> 3:12:28.320]  News reporter Charlie Spearing
[3:12:28.320 --> 3:12:30.320]  About how he planned to fight tech bias
[3:12:30.320 --> 3:12:32.320]  In the 2020 election
[3:12:32.320 --> 3:12:34.320]  He replied quote, you fight it by just
[3:12:34.320 --> 3:12:36.320]  Being good
[3:12:36.320 --> 3:12:38.320]  You've got to be really good
[3:12:38.320 --> 3:12:40.320]  It's much harder for a conservative Republican
[3:12:40.320 --> 3:12:42.320]  To win than it is for a liberal Democrat
[3:12:42.320 --> 3:12:44.320]  So
[3:12:44.320 --> 3:12:46.320]  The executive order that we were promised
[3:12:46.320 --> 3:12:48.320]  Months and months ago is not happening
[3:12:48.320 --> 3:12:50.320]  It hasn't happened
[3:12:50.320 --> 3:12:52.320]  There were rumors that it was going to be part of his
[3:12:52.320 --> 3:12:54.320]  Campaign platform after he won
[3:12:54.320 --> 3:12:56.320]  Too little, too late
[3:12:56.320 --> 3:12:58.320]  And now Trump is saying that
[3:12:58.320 --> 3:13:00.320]  Although he acknowledges
[3:13:00.320 --> 3:13:02.320]  That Twitter is blacklisting conservatives
[3:13:02.320 --> 3:13:04.320]  That they're in violation of section
[3:13:04.320 --> 3:13:06.320]  230 of the communications act
[3:13:06.320 --> 3:13:08.320]  Which decrees that social media
[3:13:08.320 --> 3:13:10.320]  Networks like Twitter and Facebook
[3:13:10.320 --> 3:13:12.320]  Have to act as platforms
[3:13:12.320 --> 3:13:14.320]  And not publishers
[3:13:14.320 --> 3:13:16.320]  As soon as they act as publishers
[3:13:16.320 --> 3:13:18.320]  In curating content, in banning content
[3:13:18.320 --> 3:13:20.320]  In banning users
[3:13:20.320 --> 3:13:22.320]  Without proper justification
[3:13:22.320 --> 3:13:24.320]  Which is brazenly proven at this point
[3:13:24.320 --> 3:13:26.320]  They lose immunity
[3:13:26.320 --> 3:13:28.320]  Under section 230 for the content
[3:13:28.320 --> 3:13:30.320]  Posted on their website
[3:13:30.320 --> 3:13:32.320]  So then they become legally liable
[3:13:32.320 --> 3:13:34.320]  For all that content
[3:13:34.320 --> 3:13:36.320]  It's very simple to have an executive
[3:13:36.320 --> 3:13:38.320]  Order to put that into force and to tighten
[3:13:38.320 --> 3:13:40.320]  That up, it's not happening
[3:13:40.320 --> 3:13:42.320]  Trump's basically said
[3:13:42.320 --> 3:13:44.320]  Just be good
[3:13:44.320 --> 3:13:46.320]  Whatever that means, I don't know
[3:13:46.320 --> 3:13:48.320]  Behave yourself and then maybe you won't get banned
[3:13:48.320 --> 3:13:50.320]  Don't be too instrumental in trying to convince
[3:13:50.320 --> 3:13:52.320]  People to vote for Donald Trump
[3:13:52.320 --> 3:13:54.320]  In this 2020 election
[3:13:54.320 --> 3:13:56.320]  Maybe that will, you know, prevent you
[3:13:56.320 --> 3:13:58.320]  From being banned. Just being good
[3:13:58.320 --> 3:14:00.320]  Isn't a solution
[3:14:00.320 --> 3:14:02.320]  Now, Mike Sernovich
[3:14:02.320 --> 3:14:04.320]  Reacted to this strongly
[3:14:04.320 --> 3:14:06.320]  And he's still talking about it on Twitter
[3:14:06.320 --> 3:14:08.320]  He tweeted, quote, I could peel off
[3:14:08.320 --> 3:14:10.320]  Enough votes from Trump to cost him 2020
[3:14:10.320 --> 3:14:12.320]  And that's exactly how I'm thinking
[3:14:12.320 --> 3:14:14.320]  If he doesn't do his executive order
[3:14:14.320 --> 3:14:16.320]  On free speech
[3:14:16.320 --> 3:14:18.320]  He must also order Treasury
[3:14:18.320 --> 3:14:20.320]  To issue regulations prohibiting
[3:14:20.320 --> 3:14:22.320]  Discriminating against conservatives
[3:14:22.320 --> 3:14:24.320]  In banking
[3:14:24.320 --> 3:14:26.320]  We've seen numerous examples of that
[3:14:26.320 --> 3:14:28.320]  Over the past few months, of course, PayPal
[3:14:28.320 --> 3:14:30.320]  Banned info was last year
[3:14:30.320 --> 3:14:32.320]  Laura Loomer had her account
[3:14:32.320 --> 3:14:34.320]  Shut down at one point
[3:14:34.320 --> 3:14:36.320]  I think it was Joe Biggs who had a problem
[3:14:36.320 --> 3:14:38.320]  With his bank account at one point
[3:14:38.320 --> 3:14:40.320]  Martina Markota had her bank
[3:14:40.320 --> 3:14:42.320]  Account shut down by Chase
[3:14:42.320 --> 3:14:44.320]  Because of political reasons
[3:14:44.320 --> 3:14:46.320]  Again, it's not just about big tech
[3:14:46.320 --> 3:14:48.320]  It's about big banking
[3:14:48.320 --> 3:14:50.320]  Shutting down conservatives
[3:14:50.320 --> 3:14:52.320]  For their political opinions
[3:14:52.320 --> 3:14:54.320]  That is brazen discrimination
[3:14:54.320 --> 3:14:56.320]  That has to stop
[3:14:56.320 --> 3:14:58.320]  But Trump's come out and said
[3:14:58.320 --> 3:15:00.320]  Just be good
[3:15:00.320 --> 3:15:02.320]  So Mike Sernovich is now
[3:15:02.320 --> 3:15:04.320]  Seriously considering running for president
[3:15:04.320 --> 3:15:06.320]  To take off
[3:15:06.320 --> 3:15:08.320]  To take away enough votes from Trump
[3:15:08.320 --> 3:15:10.320]  That will cost him
[3:15:10.320 --> 3:15:12.320]  The 2020 election
[3:15:12.320 --> 3:15:14.320]  Because that is a political threat
[3:15:14.320 --> 3:15:16.320]  At this point, it's designed to get attention
[3:15:16.320 --> 3:15:18.320]  To
[3:15:18.320 --> 3:15:20.320]  The posh for this executive order
[3:15:20.320 --> 3:15:22.320]  Which we were promised for months and months
[3:15:22.320 --> 3:15:24.320]  Which has not happened
[3:15:24.320 --> 3:15:26.320]  From Trump's latest statements
[3:15:26.320 --> 3:15:28.320]  It's very unlikely that it is going to happen
[3:15:28.320 --> 3:15:30.320]  Any time before the election
[3:15:30.320 --> 3:15:32.320]  So now, Trump's base is revolting
[3:15:32.320 --> 3:15:34.320]  We saw Ann Coulter
[3:15:34.320 --> 3:15:36.320]  Challenging Trump on the wall
[3:15:36.320 --> 3:15:38.320]  And him hitting back at her
[3:15:38.320 --> 3:15:40.320]  Calling her basically crazy
[3:15:40.320 --> 3:15:42.320]  Now, Sernovich says I brought a lot of votes to Trump
[3:15:42.320 --> 3:15:44.320]  People who family recently have no idea
[3:15:44.320 --> 3:15:46.320]  Those votes go with me
[3:15:46.320 --> 3:15:48.320]  And I get even more votes, you'll see
[3:15:48.320 --> 3:15:50.320]  So he's threatening to run against Trump
[3:15:50.320 --> 3:15:52.320]  If this executive order is not introduced
[3:15:52.320 --> 3:15:54.320]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live
[3:15:54.320 --> 3:15:56.320]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla
[3:15:56.320 --> 3:15:58.320]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago
[3:15:58.320 --> 3:16:00.320]  When they tried to seize my mother's house
[3:16:00.320 --> 3:16:02.320]  I sued the IRS in one
[3:16:02.320 --> 3:16:04.320]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since
[3:16:04.320 --> 3:16:06.320]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement

[3:16:22.320 --> 3:16:50.320]  The United States of Empire
[3:16:50.320 --> 3:16:52.320]  The last thing I want is to take another pill
[3:16:52.320 --> 3:16:54.320]  So what's so good about Sunny Bay heating pads?

[3:17:14.320 --> 3:17:16.320]  With that
[3:17:16.320 --> 3:17:18.320]  You know, what's so good about it
[3:17:18.320 --> 3:17:22.040]  legs, knees or shoulder and neck. But I need to know their good quality.

[3:17:57.720 --> 3:18:00.560]  going to be a big loss because we couldn't get the deep earth crystals anymore. It's
[3:18:00.560 --> 3:18:04.160]  been a year and a half fight, but we have the original producer, the original crystal
[3:18:04.160 --> 3:18:09.920]  source, the best atomic iodide in the world. X2 is back. We got it. This deal just happened
[3:18:09.920 --> 3:18:14.200]  about a month ago. We rushed it into production. It's been bottled. The labels are being put
[3:18:14.200 --> 3:18:19.760]  on today and then it's going to be on an 18-wheeler right here to Austin from the plant in the
[3:18:19.760 --> 3:18:23.760]  Rockies and it's going to be shipped out to you. Be sure and sign up for auto-ship.

[3:18:34.320 --> 3:18:37.720]  why the globalists don't want you to have the good halogens and what you have the bad
[3:18:37.720 --> 3:18:43.840]  halogens at infowarstore.com. That's the umbrella site, infowarstive.com. They should write the
[3:18:43.840 --> 3:18:51.000]  supplements and this is the King Daddy. Ladies and gentlemen, it is X2 original now back at
[3:18:51.000 --> 3:18:54.000]  infowarstore.com.
[3:18:54.000 --> 3:18:58.400]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[3:18:58.400 --> 3:19:03.120]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[3:19:03.120 --> 3:19:08.840]  to detoxify the body. That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense
[3:19:08.840 --> 3:19:14.720]  Support. It's made in the USA. It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely
[3:19:14.720 --> 3:19:19.640]  associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war. It is a classical 360
[3:19:19.640 --> 3:19:23.920]  win. This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we
[3:19:23.920 --> 3:19:29.200]  believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[3:19:29.200 --> 3:19:33.320]  get. You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of
[3:19:33.320 --> 3:19:38.280]  this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as
[3:19:38.280 --> 3:19:43.680]  you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those rush fires the
[3:19:43.680 --> 3:19:47.400]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be. Thanks to your support and
[3:19:47.400 --> 3:19:51.200]  your prayers together, we're changing the world. Now it's time to change our bodies
[3:19:51.200 --> 3:20:19.200]  with Z-Shield InfoWarsLive.com.
[3:20:21.520 --> 3:20:26.520]  We're going to go to a video here in a moment which I put out a couple of months ago about
[3:20:26.520 --> 3:20:32.920]  the amazing number of cases, the incredible number of cases of westerners who travel abroad
[3:20:32.920 --> 3:20:39.200]  and specifically in many cases tragically women who travel abroad to very dangerous
[3:20:39.200 --> 3:20:44.240]  countries with this mindset that the world is just a utopian playground and it's completely
[3:20:44.240 --> 3:20:48.600]  peaceful and that these countries are not dangerous and that they're not full of dangerous
[3:20:48.600 --> 3:20:54.600]  people and they go there trying to spread this message of love and peace and understanding
[3:20:54.600 --> 3:21:01.280]  and in many cases they end up dead, raped, murdered, slaughtered. We saw it a couple of
[3:21:01.280 --> 3:21:05.800]  months ago with the two Scandinavian women in Morocco, horrifically beheaded by ISIS
[3:21:05.800 --> 3:21:13.080]  on tape. Denmark responded to that by prosecuting the people who shared the video. I think people
[3:21:13.080 --> 3:21:18.520]  need to see that video to emphasize this point. We've got another example tragically of
[3:21:18.520 --> 3:21:24.240]  this today where a woman was found dead after hiking in Guatemala which has a huge violent
[3:21:24.240 --> 3:21:30.400]  crime and violent rape problem. But to preface this, let's first take a look at all the other
[3:21:30.400 --> 3:21:36.400]  recent cases of cultural relativism where you have these people, mainly females, traveling
[3:21:36.400 --> 3:21:40.880]  abroad with this deluded mindset that the world is not a dangerous place. They don't
[3:21:40.880 --> 3:21:47.280]  take proper precautions and they end up raped and murdered. Here is that video and we'll
[3:21:47.280 --> 3:21:49.560]  be back.
[3:21:49.560 --> 3:21:56.840]  Yep, it happened again. A left-wing couple travelled to a dangerous country to spread
[3:21:56.840 --> 3:22:02.240]  love. They ignored government warnings that violent crime and terrorism were commonplace
[3:22:02.240 --> 3:22:07.480]  and they ended up being abducted and possibly killed. Now the following is unconfirmed but
[3:22:07.480 --> 3:22:12.560]  it's circulating on social media. Apparently Edith Blase, a Canadian citizen, posted a
[3:22:12.560 --> 3:22:18.680]  picture of herself on Facebook holding an Iraq sign in Arabic alongside the following
[3:22:18.680 --> 3:22:23.760]  words, hitchhiking Iraq. I just wanted to share that there is love and warmth everywhere
[3:22:23.760 --> 3:22:28.480]  in the world. You just need the wisdom and courage to reach out and grasp it. Open your
[3:22:28.480 --> 3:22:32.800]  minds and hearts. We are the people showing others that the world is a place in which
[3:22:32.800 --> 3:22:40.080]  solo females can travel to its far corners. Happy 2019, let's hit the road. She hit the
[3:22:40.080 --> 3:22:44.880]  road with her boyfriend travelling through Mali and Bikina Faso with the intention of
[3:22:44.880 --> 3:22:50.480]  reaching Togo to carry out environmentalist activist work. They ignored a government travel
[3:22:50.480 --> 3:22:56.720]  advisory warning to avoid all unnecessary travel to Bikina Faso. They travelled there
[3:22:56.720 --> 3:23:02.840]  despite a 2016 Islamic terror attack in the country's capital that killed six Canadians.
[3:23:02.840 --> 3:23:08.280]  They ignored a government travel warning to quote, avoid all travel to Mali due to the
[3:23:08.280 --> 3:23:14.320]  severe threat of terrorism and violent carjacking. They ignored a global affairs Canada warning
[3:23:14.320 --> 3:23:19.800]  that armed criminals don't hesitate to shoot at vehicles to stop and rob their occupants.
[3:23:19.800 --> 3:23:25.000]  Such incidents can happen day or night on both main and secondary roads. On December
[3:23:25.000 --> 3:23:30.360]  15, all communications with their families abruptly ceased and the couple have been
[3:23:30.360 --> 3:23:36.480]  missing ever since. They were likely kidnapped and held for ransom if not murdered in cold
[3:23:36.480 --> 3:23:44.440]  blood. Two more victims of cultural relativism. The quixotic progressive utopian fantasy that
[3:23:44.440 --> 3:23:49.880]  all cultures are equal and that our negative view of some parts of the world is just a
[3:23:49.880 --> 3:23:55.840]  manifestation of our own inherent racism. But the reality is quite different. Not all
[3:23:55.840 --> 3:24:01.280]  cultures are equal. Some cultures are better than others. Not all countries are safe. Some
[3:24:01.280 --> 3:24:05.960]  countries are safer than others. The most dangerous countries in the world are almost
[3:24:05.960 --> 3:24:12.000]  exclusively located in the Middle East and Africa. Don't believe me? Just look at any
[3:24:12.000 --> 3:24:17.520]  list. The Middle East and Africa. The same two continents from which Europe is accepting
[3:24:17.520 --> 3:24:23.680]  millions and millions of migrants. And while leftists like CNN's Anna Navarro can file
[3:24:23.680 --> 3:24:30.480]  their nails and roll their eyes, the fact remains. This is why we have borders to keep
[3:24:30.480 --> 3:24:37.800]  out violent criminals and terrorists. Borders work. Walls work. Walls work. But if you
[3:24:37.800 --> 3:24:44.600]  import people from violent cultures and dangerous countries, then your own society is going
[3:24:44.600 --> 3:24:50.920]  to become more violent and more dangerous. You can't argue with that fact. Now obviously
[3:24:50.920 --> 3:24:56.040]  this isn't to say that you should just live like a hermit in fear and never travel anywhere.
[3:24:56.040 --> 3:25:02.640]  But if you visit violent, crime-ridden, poverty-stricken countries as a westerner with the pie-in-the-sky
[3:25:02.640 --> 3:25:09.560]  belief that everyone is as tolerant, open-minded and peaceful as progressives make out with
[3:25:09.560 --> 3:25:14.600]  the urge to vacation in shithole countries just so you can come back and virtue signal
[3:25:14.600 --> 3:25:19.280]  about it to all your lefty friends, then eventually you're going to run into trouble.
[3:25:19.280 --> 3:25:23.800]  And it's not just anecdotal evidence that strongly suggests these people put themselves
[3:25:23.800 --> 3:25:28.820]  at risk because of their erroneous, innate, progressive beliefs. There's science to back
[3:25:28.820 --> 3:25:35.160]  it up. A study by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln reported on by Scientific American found that
[3:25:35.160 --> 3:25:41.360]  conservatives are more attuned than liberals to assessing potential threats. How many more
[3:25:41.360 --> 3:25:46.640]  examples of this do we need to see before liberals accept that their utopian view of
[3:25:46.640 --> 3:25:52.200]  the world is a complete self-delusion? Two Scandinavian tourists who went hiking in Morocco,
[3:25:52.200 --> 3:25:57.160]  one of whom posted an anti-Islamophobia video and urged her followers to not judge people
[3:25:57.160 --> 3:26:02.240]  by their appearance, raped and beheaded by Islamic terrorists. Swedish supporter of multiculturalism
[3:26:02.240 --> 3:26:08.360]  and a strong advocate of mass immigration, member of a Facebook page called We Like Diversity,
[3:26:08.360 --> 3:26:12.420]  raped and killed by an Ethiopian immigrant and dumped in a forest. Left-wing American
[3:26:12.420 --> 3:26:16.560]  couple who cycled through the Middle East and the Balkans wrote blogs about how evil
[3:26:16.560 --> 3:26:21.880]  is a make-believe concept born out of Westerners' bigoted views of other cultures. Mowed down
[3:26:21.880 --> 3:26:26.320]  and stabbed to death by Islamic terrorists, Italian performance artist who said she would
[3:26:26.320 --> 3:26:30.920]  hitchhike from Italy to the Middle East to quote, send a message of peace and marriage
[3:26:30.920 --> 3:26:36.520]  between different peoples and nations, raped and strangled to death. Belgian psychologist
[3:26:36.520 --> 3:26:41.280]  who worked with failed asylum seekers in Sweden to prevent their deportation. Mowed down by
[3:26:41.280 --> 3:26:46.600]  a truck driven by a failed asylum seeker in Sweden, liberal activist who traveled to Haiti
[3:26:46.600 --> 3:26:51.680]  to raise awareness about violence against women while decrying the racism of Westerners
[3:26:51.680 --> 3:26:58.000]  towards black men. Held on a rooftop and repeatedly raped by a black man. Female interpreter working
[3:26:58.000 --> 3:27:02.840]  on a documentary about the plight of vulnerable refugees, raped by refugees. There are more
[3:27:02.840 --> 3:27:08.960]  examples in my previous video which is linked in the description. Evil exists in the world,
[3:27:08.960 --> 3:27:14.600]  danger exists in the world and those two things are more likely to exist in certain parts
[3:27:14.600 --> 3:27:20.920]  of the world than others. And just because the BBC or the Guardian or MSNBC or the Huffington
[3:27:20.920 --> 3:27:27.160]  Post tells you that such beliefs are only held by racists doesn't make them any less
[3:27:27.160 --> 3:27:33.280]  true. Projecting your own fanciful progressive worldview onto other cultures doesn't eliminate
[3:27:33.280 --> 3:27:40.320]  the negative aspects of those cultures. It only increases the chance of you becoming
[3:27:40.320 --> 3:27:41.320]  another victim.
[3:27:41.320 --> 3:27:51.400]  That video is called It Happened Again. It's up on YouTube and maybe it happened again.
[3:27:51.400 --> 3:27:54.960]  We've got another story about this today up on infowars.com which I'll get into in
[3:27:54.960 --> 3:27:59.520]  depth after the break because we've got about a minute left here. But here's another headline
[3:27:59.520 --> 3:28:04.080]  related headline out of the New York Post. Americans are traveling alone more than ever.
[3:28:04.080 --> 3:28:08.200]  Solo travel is indisputably on the rise as nearly one in four Americans prefers to travel
[3:28:08.200 --> 3:28:14.600]  alone according to new research. So again, this just goes to the atomization of society.
[3:28:14.600 --> 3:28:19.320]  Who would want to travel on their own anyway? How boring would that be? But more Americans
[3:28:19.320 --> 3:28:24.840]  are traveling alone. You've got left-wing newspapers encouraging women to go to dangerous
[3:28:24.840 --> 3:28:31.640]  countries and travel alone even in light of story after story after story of them not
[3:28:31.640 --> 3:28:35.960]  coming home. And we've got another example of that which happened to a British woman
[3:28:35.960 --> 3:28:40.960]  in Guatemala. Again, probably the rape capital of South America. I'm going to get into that
[3:28:40.960 --> 3:28:45.960]  story right after this break. This is the Alex Show Show Live breaking news infowars.com.
[3:28:45.960 --> 3:29:14.960]  Don't go away, but we'll be back.

[3:32:00.280 --> 3:32:05.960]  wants it, who's prepared to go the longest and who's ready to do the damage. We took
[3:32:05.960 --> 3:32:10.600]  on Hillary Clinton. We stopped her. We got a national stand. Nationalists are getting

[3:34:47.400 --> 3:34:54.160]  Headline up on Infowars.com, cultural relativism, British woman found dead after hiking in Guatemala.
[3:34:54.160 --> 3:34:58.720]  And I'm reminded of the story, of course, which was published by the Huffington Post,
[3:34:58.720 --> 3:35:03.480]  not known as the right wing publication. 80% of Central American women girls are raped
[3:35:03.480 --> 3:35:09.840]  crossing into the US. And it made the point. This is from a fusion investigation. 80% of
[3:35:09.840 --> 3:35:14.720]  women and girls crossing into the US by way of Mexico are raped during their journey.
[3:35:14.720 --> 3:35:19.400]  That's up from a previous estimate of 60% according to Amnesty International. And of
[3:35:19.400 --> 3:35:25.600]  course, many of those women and young girls are coming from El Salvador and Guatemala,
[3:35:25.600 --> 3:35:32.360]  which is where this British hiker was holidaying over the past few weeks. 23 year old British
[3:35:32.360 --> 3:35:36.600]  woman Catherine Shaw had set out traveling in September 2018 and was in Guatemala for
[3:35:36.600 --> 3:35:43.160]  two weeks before being reported missing on March the 5th. Her body was subsequently found.
[3:35:43.160 --> 3:35:48.480]  Now, the charity that was behind the search for her body or the search for her when she
[3:35:48.480 --> 3:35:54.400]  went missing were very, very insistent on coming out before the police investigation
[3:35:54.400 --> 3:35:59.760]  was even concluded and asserting that her death was an accident. Now, it could well
[3:35:59.760 --> 3:36:05.200]  have been an accident. Nobody knows, but they were very keen to stress that from the start.
[3:36:05.200 --> 3:36:09.840]  They said that speculation she'd been raped and murdered was quote, incredibly unhelpful,
[3:36:09.840 --> 3:36:16.440]  distressing and unnecessary. Problem is that from the reports, it sounds like she was found
[3:36:16.440 --> 3:36:22.440]  naked. Now, they claimed that she'd stripped off her own clothes while climbing up the
[3:36:22.440 --> 3:36:29.560]  side of a hiking trail. And that that was the reason why she was found dead naked. This
[3:36:29.560 --> 3:36:34.520]  was before a police investigation has even been concluded. And while authorities still
[3:36:34.520 --> 3:36:40.040]  say that they're investigating the potential that a third party was involved in her death.
[3:36:40.040 --> 3:36:43.960]  So this charity was very keen to come out and stress even though she was found naked
[3:36:43.960 --> 3:36:48.920]  that she wasn't raped and murdered. And that may well be the case. But we've seen as we
[3:36:48.920 --> 3:36:54.040]  saw in the video we played before the break, numerous examples of these mainly young women
[3:36:54.040 --> 3:37:00.080]  from Western countries going to dangerous countries traveling traveling alone in many
[3:37:00.080 --> 3:37:05.160]  cases, not making it back. They see the American couple who went cycling through the Balkans
[3:37:05.160 --> 3:37:09.240]  in the Middle East to prove that the world was a safe place. They said that our view
[3:37:09.240 --> 3:37:15.680]  that the world was dangerous in certain areas was merely a product of our own bigotry racism
[3:37:15.680 --> 3:37:20.400]  through every country they traveled, they were harassed, they were robbed in some cases
[3:37:20.400 --> 3:37:27.200]  attacked. And they wound up being mowed down in trucks by ISIS and then stabbed to death.
[3:37:27.200 --> 3:37:31.320]  ISIS made a propaganda video after the fact there you see the two Scandinavian hikers
[3:37:31.320 --> 3:37:37.760]  who went to a remote region in Morocco. And again, one of them had posted a video on her
[3:37:37.760 --> 3:37:42.880]  Facebook page about how Muslims were being demonized as violent. It was basically a propaganda
[3:37:42.880 --> 3:37:48.600]  video showing a Muslim man carrying a bag. Then some police arrived there you see the
[3:37:48.600 --> 3:37:52.980]  video, a screenshot of it. The police arrived to chase somebody on the street. It looks
[3:37:52.980 --> 3:37:56.520]  like they're chasing this Muslim guy, but they run straight past the Muslim guy with
[3:37:56.520 --> 3:38:02.560]  a beard and tackle the white guy with a suit and a briefcase. And Maren Yulun shared this
[3:38:02.560 --> 3:38:09.000]  video to express her opposition to Islamophobia. She wound up getting raped and beheaded by
[3:38:09.000 --> 3:38:15.440]  Islamic terrorists. Now, I found the Facebook page of this British woman tragically killed
[3:38:15.440 --> 3:38:21.800]  in Guatemala, Catherine Shaw. And she too had shared links promoting open borders. And
[3:38:21.800 --> 3:38:27.040]  she had a bunch of likes on her Facebook page, which suggested that she had left-wing views.
[3:38:27.040 --> 3:38:34.080]  They were advocacy groups for environmental activism and new age spirituality. But again,
[3:38:34.080 --> 3:38:39.920]  the charity responsible for helping search for this woman insists that she wasn't raped
[3:38:39.920 --> 3:38:43.520]  or murdered even though she was found naked. So the police are still investigating that
[3:38:43.520 --> 3:38:50.640]  remains to be seen. But the U.S. State Department in its official travel advisory about Guatemala
[3:38:50.640 --> 3:38:56.080]  says, quote, violent crime such as armed robbery, murder is common. Gang activity such as extortion,
[3:38:56.080 --> 3:39:02.200]  violent street crime and narcotics trafficking is widespread. They've had 30 years of civil
[3:39:02.200 --> 3:39:07.080]  war after which sexual violence committed against women is now commonplace. That was
[3:39:07.080 --> 3:39:13.440]  basically instituted as a tool of war, raping women, which of course is why many young girls
[3:39:13.440 --> 3:39:18.320]  and women are fleeing to America. But even when they do, 80% of them coming through
[3:39:18.320 --> 3:39:25.080]  Mexico from countries, including Guatemala, are raped. Now, this is a serious problem.
[3:39:25.080 --> 3:39:30.560]  The worldview espoused by the cycling couple that was showed an image of was again, they
[3:39:30.560 --> 3:39:36.080]  did an article in the New York Times basically studying their blogs and they said, this idea
[3:39:36.080 --> 3:39:40.040]  that some countries are more dangerous than others, that some cultures are more dangerous
[3:39:40.040 --> 3:39:46.840]  than others, that some cultures are more violent towards women, is a racist bigoted myth invented
[3:39:46.840 --> 3:39:53.880]  by ignorant Westerners. And literally in every blog, they made illusions to this belief despite
[3:39:53.880 --> 3:39:59.240]  the fact that also in every blog, they were basically getting harassed into in all these
[3:39:59.240 --> 3:40:04.320]  Muslim countries that they visited. In one case, the guy literally got almost crushed
[3:40:04.320 --> 3:40:10.480]  up against a vehicle because they wouldn't let him cross the road on a bike. Hitchhiking
[3:40:10.480 --> 3:40:15.960]  Iraq, that was another case featured in my video. There was a, there was a an Israeli
[3:40:15.960 --> 3:40:21.080]  woman who again, hitchhiked across the Middle East to prove that Islam was a religion of
[3:40:21.080 --> 3:40:27.440]  peace ended up getting raped and strangled to death in Turkey. There was a woman in Sweden
[3:40:27.440 --> 3:40:33.400]  who again was a big proponent of migration. She was kidnapped after getting off a train
[3:40:33.400 --> 3:40:39.480]  raped and her body was dumped in the woods by a failed asylum seeker. So again, we see
[3:40:39.480 --> 3:40:44.800]  a trend here and it's largely based on the fact that a lot of these leftists travel the
[3:40:44.800 --> 3:40:49.520]  world not knowing that the world is a dangerous place. They think that they can impose their
[3:40:49.520 --> 3:40:53.160]  world view on the rest of the world and that the rest of the world will just go along with
[3:40:53.160 --> 3:41:01.480]  it when in reality, that is not the case. So potentially another tragic example of that.
[3:41:01.480 --> 3:41:07.880]  Meanwhile, in Germany, Maniels Ale Akbar at funeral of German woman murdered by Muslim
[3:41:07.880 --> 3:41:12.600]  boyfriend. So basically there was a white German woman named in the media as Cynthia
[3:41:12.600 --> 3:41:17.160]  are. They don't use their full surnames in German media who married a Muslim migrant
[3:41:17.160 --> 3:41:23.400]  who was about to be deported. When this Muslim migrant named as Armet T tried to convince
[3:41:23.400 --> 3:41:29.200]  his girlfriend to travel to Tunisia with him to leave Germany, he viciously stabbed her
[3:41:29.200 --> 3:41:36.080]  with a kitchen knife through the neck, lungs, hands, and in her back more than 10 times.
[3:41:36.080 --> 3:41:43.680]  So then the local, the local population there in Worms, Germany had a funeral march, 500
[3:41:43.680 --> 3:41:48.640]  people marched to the funeral. As soon as they got to the funeral, a man rushed to the
[3:41:48.640 --> 3:41:54.600]  front of the church shouted Allah Akbar with his arms outstretched, which of course means
[3:41:54.600 --> 3:41:59.040]  God is great in Arabic, but it also is routinely shouted by Islamic terrorists before they carry
[3:41:59.040 --> 3:42:05.040]  out violent attacks. 20 of the attendees to this funeral rushed out of the church. They
[3:42:05.040 --> 3:42:09.920]  were distraught. They were crying. The police eventually arrested the man and then the media
[3:42:09.920 --> 3:42:18.160]  blamed it on a bad joke or a confused individual. So again, you had a woman, white woman, German
[3:42:18.160 --> 3:42:22.400]  woman, marrying a Muslim man. He forced her into a hijab. He asked her to move to Tunisia
[3:42:22.400 --> 3:42:27.720]  with him after he was about to be deported, viciously killed her. And then somebody
[3:42:27.720 --> 3:42:34.400]  else, presumably possibly somebody that knew the perpetrator, basically ruined her funeral,
[3:42:34.400 --> 3:42:40.880]  terrified dozens of attendees and the media reported it as just a bad joke. That's what's
[3:42:40.880 --> 3:42:45.880]  going on in Germany. Migrant crime is again on the rise. Violent crime is on the rise.
[3:42:45.880 --> 3:42:50.480]  90% of it is due to migrants, according to the government's own statistics. Cultural

[3:47:20.160 --> 3:47:24.200]  I'm going to get into some more new stories here. In a second, first, I want to tell you
[3:47:24.200 --> 3:47:31.920]  about the massive discount we've got on bodies available right now at InfowarsLive.com. This

[3:49:13.640 --> 3:49:20.000]  Now, staying on cultural enrichment news in Europe, 800-year-old church heavily vandalized
[3:49:20.000 --> 3:49:26.120]  in French no-go suburbs, Sondanie. Remember, this is one of the areas where the Paris massacre
[3:49:26.120 --> 3:49:32.840]  suspects hit out after the attack. Now, the Basilica of Sondanie built in 1135 was heavily
[3:49:32.840 --> 3:49:37.320]  vandalized last week with vandals smashing stained glass windows and severely damaging
[3:49:37.320 --> 3:49:43.000]  the nearly 200-year-old organ. It appears as if somebody had actually broken into the
[3:49:43.000 --> 3:49:49.040]  church beforehand, hid inside the organ, smashed their way out of it, and then smashed up some
[3:49:49.040 --> 3:49:54.280]  ancient stained glass windows in this beautiful Basilica, which is located in the middle of
[3:49:54.280 --> 3:50:01.040]  a migrant no-go zone. Hmm, I wonder who the prime suspects could be. This was also the
[3:50:01.040 --> 3:50:06.040]  site of a left-wing raid of the church, I think that was a couple of years ago, where
[3:50:06.040 --> 3:50:11.120]  they teamed up with migrants to raid the church in protest against a law that would have curbed
[3:50:11.120 --> 3:50:18.040]  illegal immigration. Sondanie has 400,000 illegal immigrants living there. This is one
[3:50:18.040 --> 3:50:26.040]  area of Paris. One area of Paris has 400,000 illegal immigrants living in it. And now,
[3:50:26.040 --> 3:50:32.280]  the beautiful Basilica of Sondanie has been vandalized. I wonder who the prime suspects
[3:50:32.280 --> 3:50:39.640]  might be. Swedish Islamophobia experts and ISIS fighters are arrested in Syria. Swedish
[3:50:39.640 --> 3:50:45.080]  Norwegian Islamophobia experts and Islamic State jihadists, the government of Sweden
[3:50:45.080 --> 3:50:50.000]  actually hired somebody to be the expert on Islamophobia and to lecture everyone else
[3:50:50.000 --> 3:50:58.320]  about being mean to Muslims. He joined ISIS. That was his next career step. They also had
[3:50:58.320 --> 3:51:02.800]  a cultural expert who basically said that Swedish culture was trash. They appointed him
[3:51:02.800 --> 3:51:08.840]  as the head of their cultural heritage board. But the government Islamophobia expert who
[3:51:08.840 --> 3:51:15.240]  lectured everyone about being mean to Muslims, who literally went on to join ISIS and went
[3:51:15.240 --> 3:51:21.080]  to Syria to fight alongside Islamic terrorists, has now been arrested by Kurdish forces in
[3:51:21.080 --> 3:51:26.560]  Syria with sources claiming Norway wants to prosecute the extremists. The 33-year-old
[3:51:26.560 --> 3:51:30.800]  born in Sweden to Norwegian parents was captured this week in the village of Baghus, in one
[3:51:30.800 --> 3:51:35.360]  of the very few remaining areas under any form of Islamic State control, Swedish newspaper
[3:51:35.360 --> 3:51:41.360]  Express and reports. So he was literally the government expert on Islamophobia joined ISIS.
[3:51:41.360 --> 3:51:48.000]  No, they finally caught him. Also, as these final ISIS areas fall in Syria, jihadi brides
[3:51:48.000 --> 3:51:54.320]  yell daesh slogans amid battle for last stronghold in Syria. This is out of sputnik. So of course,
[3:51:54.320 --> 3:51:59.400]  we've got this entire debate in the UK over allowing in literal terrorist wives, not just
[3:51:59.400 --> 3:52:06.280]  wives, but actual open ISIS supporters like the woman with the baby recently was a, received
[3:52:06.280 --> 3:52:13.160]  widespread platform, positive sympathetic platform, Miss Begum to return to the UK.
[3:52:13.160 --> 3:52:18.120]  Despite the fact that she said she saw severed heads in trash cans, but that they deserved
[3:52:18.120 --> 3:52:23.080]  it because they were enemies of ISIS. These are the people who the left wing media lobbying
[3:52:23.080 --> 3:52:26.640]  to allow back into the UK.
[3:52:26.640 --> 3:52:30.840]  Now we have a Kurdish led Syrian democratic forces continuing their offensive in the Syrian
[3:52:30.840 --> 3:52:36.920]  city of Baghus and a video, which is in this news article showing Daesh brides still loyal
[3:52:36.920 --> 3:52:41.280]  to the self proclaimed caliphate, caliphate yelling abusive words and saluting the terror
[3:52:41.280 --> 3:52:48.880]  group. So the video basically shows them throwing water bottles at media people, insulting people,
[3:52:48.880 --> 3:52:54.320]  shouting back here, which is from ISIS. They call it Daesh. Why anyone calls it Daesh?
[3:52:54.320 --> 3:53:00.120]  I've got no idea. It's just confusing. It's ISIS. Okay. So they're yelling the ISIS slogan
[3:53:00.120 --> 3:53:05.760]  back here. Watt Hamad, which is translated as remaining and expanding. Yeah, not really.
[3:53:05.760 --> 3:53:10.160]  You've been wiped out systematically, verbally abusing journalists and throwing water and
[3:53:10.160 --> 3:53:15.640]  bottles at the camera, filming them over the weekend. The Daily Mail report that foreign
[3:53:15.640 --> 3:53:19.680]  jihadi brides have been isolated from other female refugees in the whole camp in northeast
[3:53:19.680 --> 3:53:25.760]  Syria, since they tried to assault the infidels for not abiding by the laws of the self proclaimed
[3:53:25.760 --> 3:53:30.640]  caliphate. So when they go on their media blitz, they claim to be reformed characters
[3:53:30.640 --> 3:53:34.640]  and that they're leaving it all behind. But in actual fact, they're still assaulting the
[3:53:34.640 --> 3:53:41.880]  infidels, shouting ISIS slogans and throwing bottles at cameraman. So now you can't come
[3:53:41.880 --> 3:53:49.160]  back in. Sorry. That's going on in Syria. We also have more tech news now. I spoke about
[3:53:49.160 --> 3:53:53.440]  Trump talking about big tech censorship earlier, which he acknowledged, but said he would do
[3:53:53.440 --> 3:53:59.440]  nothing about. He said, just be good. Well, now YouTube changes search algorithm to suppress
[3:53:59.440 --> 3:54:05.400]  criticism of Brie Larson and Captain Marvel. We've spoken about this many times before.
[3:54:05.400 --> 3:54:11.720]  Anytime YouTube wants to break its own search engine, it merely classifies a subject as
[3:54:11.720 --> 3:54:18.680]  news. So as soon as it drops into that news category, a wall of mainstream media search
[3:54:18.680 --> 3:54:24.920]  results appear above every other independently made video, which is kind of ironic, given
[3:54:24.920 --> 3:54:31.680]  that it's called YouTube. They've gained it to favor their corporate partners. So anytime
[3:54:31.680 --> 3:54:36.160]  they want to criticize, anytime they want to censor, dissent against any cultural or
[3:54:36.160 --> 3:54:42.120]  media narrative, they just pick out a subject or a name and plop it in the news category.
[3:54:42.120 --> 3:54:47.920]  Then every other search result for this topic is buried beneath a wall of mainstream media
[3:54:47.920 --> 3:54:51.920]  results, which are obviously pushing the entirely opposite narrative. And they've done it once
[3:54:51.920 --> 3:54:56.720]  again. Google owned YouTube changed their search algorithm last week to suppress criticism
[3:54:56.720 --> 3:55:02.120]  of Disney's Captain Marvel before its release on March the 8th. So he had a bunch of people
[3:55:02.120 --> 3:55:07.840]  making videos saying that this was just another warped identity politics, social justice,
[3:55:07.840 --> 3:55:13.120]  warrior narrative, that this was a terrible film. They partnered with Disney, obviously
[3:55:13.120 --> 3:55:19.200]  had a call with Disney and said, get rid of this and it was gone. And remember, Google
[3:55:19.200 --> 3:55:24.400]  YouTube changed their search results, routinely changed their search results, their YouTube
[3:55:24.400 --> 3:55:28.960]  search results, YouTube being the second biggest search engine in the world. In response to
[3:55:28.960 --> 3:55:35.920]  complaints by left wing journalists, Slate complained about the fact that anti-abortion
[3:55:35.920 --> 3:55:41.240]  videos were appearing at the top of YouTube search results. Within hours, that was changed.
[3:55:41.240 --> 3:55:46.800]  They also made that change in Ireland before the Irish referendum. So he had them literally
[3:55:46.800 --> 3:55:52.520]  election meddling by changing search results, artificially amplifying others which carried
[3:55:52.520 --> 3:55:58.720]  the narrative above ones which didn't. So the article makes the point here. In less
[3:55:58.720 --> 3:56:04.200]  than two years time, they've gone from, we must suppress crisis act to conspiracy theories
[3:56:04.200 --> 3:56:09.280]  to we must suppress negative movie critiques of Disney propaganda films. And you have the
[3:56:09.280 --> 3:56:15.880]  same bizarre situation on Rotten Tomatoes, where you see the critic reviews, which are
[3:56:15.880 --> 3:56:21.040]  obviously half of them are getting paid off to give a movie good reviews. It's about them
[3:56:21.040 --> 3:56:26.640]  being in with the production studios, completely odds with the user reviews. So you could get
[3:56:26.640 --> 3:56:32.520]  a movie review, a critic review on Rotten Tomatoes, which is like 85%. For the exact
[3:56:32.520 --> 3:56:39.760]  same movie, the user reviews, the punters, the people have actually seen it, 30%. There
[3:56:39.760 --> 3:56:44.920]  is a diametrically opposed. Everyone who sees it in the general public thinks it's a bad
[3:56:44.920 --> 3:56:51.840]  movie most of the time because it pushes diversity and identity politics over having a good plot
[3:56:51.840 --> 3:56:55.720]  and characters who you care about compared to the critics who are going to say it's
[3:56:55.720 --> 3:57:03.360]  great whatever because they're in on the media bandwagon. So now no one can even tell what's
[3:57:03.360 --> 3:57:08.040]  a good movie anymore because the difference is so vast on websites like Rotten Tomatoes
[3:57:08.040 --> 3:57:13.720]  because these critic reviews are just on the bandwagon of pushing this identity politics
[3:57:13.720 --> 3:57:19.840]  narrative with Captain Marvel, with other movies in the past, with the female Ghostbusters.
[3:57:19.840 --> 3:57:25.320]  When the actual general public sees it, they trash it and those reviews get buried just
[3:57:25.320 --> 3:57:32.160]  as the YouTube reviews about this Captain Marvel film and now getting buried on YouTube.
[3:57:32.160 --> 3:57:35.040]  That's going to wrap it up for the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show breaking news
