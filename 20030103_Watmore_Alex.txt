[00:00.000 --> 00:06.480]  I read a chilling news article on air that a lot of people couldn't believe, but we linked directly on Infowars.com
[00:06.480 --> 00:12.480]  through the Times of London and other news reports. Channel 4 will show performance artists eating baby.
[00:12.480 --> 00:25.360]  Now, the Bohemian Grove footage I shot was used on Channel 4 production, and Channel 4 has been accused of sensationalism over a decision to broadcast a program that will show a performance artist eating the flesh of a dead baby.
[00:25.360 --> 00:33.360]  It shows the Chinese artist, as they call him, the degenerate, washing the newborn dead baby and then eating it.
[00:33.360 --> 00:40.240]  And this is to be aired tonight in the United Kingdom, I guess on some satellite channels around the world.
[00:40.240 --> 00:46.800]  No wonder some of these foreign countries hate the West so much now, giving the image that the West would show something like this.
[00:46.800 --> 00:55.120]  We know this has been going on in the East for a long time, but do we have to go to the level of total barbarism where there's no value in human life?
[00:56.000 --> 01:08.480]  It's just amazing. We're joined right now by John Milton Whitmore, chairman of MediaWatch, and we have a link to their fine organization on Infowars.com.
[01:08.480 --> 01:15.280]  He's saying the artist is being controversial for controversy's sake, not for art. It is also typical of Channel 4 to try to be sensationalist.
[01:15.280 --> 01:22.640]  I would say much more than sensationalist. This should be criminal. It's totally obscene and just totally evil.
[01:22.880 --> 01:28.400]  And doctors in the U.S., and I believe in the U.K., you have to have a special license just to own a skull.
[01:28.400 --> 01:37.120]  My father is an oral surgeon and teaches at Baylor University Medical School, and he has to have a special license to own a skull.
[01:37.120 --> 01:45.040]  But this guy can sit around eating babies. I think this is the angle we need to attack this from. Thank you for joining me, John Milton Whitmore.
[01:45.040 --> 01:49.840]  Good morning to you, Alex. Thank you, Vic. I don't know why you've got me on the show. You've made a very good K-Test yourself there.
[01:50.720 --> 01:59.200]  Well, you're there. This is airing in just a few hours. You're trying to block it, admirably so.
[01:59.200 --> 02:02.800]  Tell us about your organization and when you first learned of this horror.
[02:04.320 --> 02:15.760]  Well, MediaWatch has been in operation over here, Alex, since 1964, and it was inaugurated by the late Mary Whitehouse, CBE.
[02:16.160 --> 02:24.080]  She died last year. And for many years now, we've been fighting any organization in the media,
[02:24.080 --> 02:28.720]  whether it be the written word or radio or television or what, and latterly the internet as well,
[02:29.520 --> 02:38.080]  who are attempting to put out material for general consumption that we feel is morally
[02:38.080 --> 02:45.840]  indefensible, that lacks taste and decency. And we have a small but dedicated team that
[02:47.200 --> 02:52.000]  goes about this work, and I'm the chairman of the organization and I'm an ex-television producer,
[02:52.000 --> 03:01.280]  so I know the area very well. When we heard about this particular outrage, in fact,
[03:02.000 --> 03:07.760]  Channel 4 had kept it very close to their chest, and I heard it, first of all, when one or two of
[03:07.760 --> 03:15.920]  my friends in the press phoned me up as outraged and surprised as you are. By the way, we gave
[03:15.920 --> 03:20.880]  Channel 4, we've been calling them since this weekend, they will not return our calls,
[03:20.880 --> 03:25.840]  they do not want to come on, so we gave them a chance to give their side. Well, perhaps I
[03:25.840 --> 03:30.880]  were to tell your listeners a little bit about the television setup over here, being a much
[03:30.880 --> 03:37.920]  smaller country than the United States, we mainly have a very few national broadcasters, of course,
[03:37.920 --> 03:45.120]  so everyone will have heard of the BBC and the independent television company ITV, which is a
[03:45.120 --> 03:50.400]  commercial arm of television over here, they've got one or two channels and, luckily, Digital has
[03:50.400 --> 03:56.480]  come on stream, they've got several more as well. Channel 4 was put into operation 20-odd years ago,
[03:56.480 --> 04:02.640]  so they're quite the baby of the group, and it's important for your listeners, Alex, to know that
[04:02.640 --> 04:11.520]  Channel 4 was set up deliberately to make programs for minority audiences, and they've succeeded
[04:11.520 --> 04:23.040]  admirably, and if Channel 4 were a little more successful at making, sorry, if they were a little
[04:23.040 --> 04:28.080]  less consistent with making successful programs for minority audiences, we could just ignore them
[04:28.080 --> 04:36.160]  and go away, but unfortunately, they make either very good programs or absolutely atrocious
[04:36.160 --> 04:40.960]  programs, and this clearly falls into the absolutely atrocious. Also, I've seen a lot of
[04:40.960 --> 04:46.880]  British writers point out that they do some serious issues and they mix it in with a bunch of trash,
[04:46.880 --> 04:56.640]  thus destroying the legitimacy of other programs, so it's almost being used to discredit a lot of
[04:56.640 --> 05:02.960]  different things. Now, details of this baby eating, according to the Times of London, it's scheduled to
[05:02.960 --> 05:10.160]  air tonight, do you know what time? Yes, I haven't seen the program, I ought to state that up front,
[05:10.240 --> 05:16.880]  I haven't actually seen the program, it is due to go out UK time at five past eleven in the evening
[05:16.880 --> 05:23.600]  this evening, and it lasts about an hour. So that's in about four or five hours? Absolutely,
[05:23.600 --> 05:30.720]  yeah, and it's very unlikely at this stage that it will be pulled from the screen. Channel 4 are
[05:30.720 --> 05:35.760]  enjoying the notoriety of the publicity they're getting at the moment, and I have a feeling because
[05:35.760 --> 05:41.040]  of it they'll be more than viewers listening in and looking in than perhaps would have been
[05:41.040 --> 05:48.160]  otherwise. Well, that's obviously one of the reasons they're doing this. Now, Channel 4 did
[05:48.160 --> 05:56.240]  talk to the Times of London, they admit that it shows the skills of this Chinese so-called artist
[05:57.280 --> 06:02.800]  washing a newborn stillborn baby and then eating it, and then getting sick from eating it.
[06:03.680 --> 06:10.640]  Can you give us any details of what Channel 4 has said, or what other press reports are saying about
[06:10.640 --> 06:20.000]  the details of this truly wicked production? Well, curiously enough, as I say, wallowing in the
[06:20.800 --> 06:27.040]  publicity they're getting on this particular one issue, the program itself is about art culture
[06:27.040 --> 06:35.040]  in general in China, and I suspect that this particular piece in the program will only take
[06:35.040 --> 06:41.520]  up three or four minutes of an hour-long program. The program isn't about the artist concerned,
[06:41.520 --> 06:46.320]  it's just touching on some of his work, and it's interesting to note, and I'm not thinking to
[06:46.320 --> 06:52.000]  justify this at all, but just again so we have a bit more background information, the artist has
[06:52.000 --> 06:58.240]  gone on record as saying that his work, questionable though you may think it be,
[07:00.080 --> 07:09.840]  is attempting to fall between what is legal just about and what is morally indefensible.
[07:12.640 --> 07:19.600]  We've had serial killers that kidnap women and gut them and then say it was an art performance,
[07:19.600 --> 07:24.080]  it says Zhu, the degenerate who's doing this who claims to be a Christian, says his group has a
[07:24.080 --> 07:29.440]  major impact on his art, Jesus is always related to blood, death, and wounds, and this is an
[07:29.440 --> 07:34.960]  reflection of my art, this person needs to be in a mental institution in my opinion.
[07:36.240 --> 07:41.200]  I'm inclined to agree with you, and I too am a Christian, and I'm deeply offended
[07:41.200 --> 07:46.160]  by him drawing lines parallel with the Christian faith.
[07:46.800 --> 07:51.600]  Well how can they arrest the former BBC host of A Man and His Dog,
[07:53.600 --> 07:58.160]  Robin Clark, how can they arrest him for saying farmers deserve the same rights as
[07:58.160 --> 08:04.400]  other minority groups, blacks, Muslims, and gays, homosexuals, and then he gets arrested,
[08:04.400 --> 08:07.760]  but then this guy can go on TV and eat babies, I mean this is insane.
[08:08.400 --> 08:15.120]  It is, I agree, and of course we don't have any jurisdiction over the artist, he's in China.
[08:15.520 --> 08:19.920]  But Channel 4 is airing this and propagating this trash.
[08:19.920 --> 08:25.280]  Well I agree with you, and we're doing all we can, I've had numerous calls this week from around the
[08:25.280 --> 08:31.440]  world to talk about this, and we have inquired of all our membership, and they're going to write
[08:31.440 --> 08:36.400]  to the Broadcasting Standards Commission about this, Channel 4 already have an avalanche of
[08:36.400 --> 08:41.760]  phone calls and letters from people associated with us about the impending program, they will
[08:41.760 --> 08:48.320]  get a lot more when it's gone out as well, but it's curious, you know, that over here we do have
[08:48.320 --> 08:55.440]  in the UK a very far too liberal attitude about these things, we've had our own artist Tracy
[08:55.440 --> 09:02.800]  Ermin with her Unmade Bed winning an award, Damien Hirst preserving a sheep in formaldehyde winning
[09:02.800 --> 09:08.240]  award, the pile of bricks that won an award a few years ago at the Tate, we do have a rather sad
[09:08.240 --> 09:13.440]  record as far as I'm concerned. Well, look, I mean here we've got people going in and smearing
[09:14.320 --> 09:22.560]  elephant dung on Christian icons and pictures of, you know, $200,000 the government buys a picture
[09:22.560 --> 09:29.760]  of a crucifix and a glass of urine, but that all pales in significance to eating a baby. Also,
[09:29.760 --> 09:32.960]  I take it from the article here in the Times of London, you may be able to correct this,
[09:32.960 --> 09:40.960]  that this was shot in China and in China we know they have forced abortion and infanticide,
[09:40.960 --> 09:47.520]  we know that you can buy baby parts in health food stores, but so I mean obviously it was done in
[09:47.520 --> 09:53.920]  China where this is legal, but at the same time do we know the history of this newborn dead baby?
[09:55.120 --> 10:00.080]  We don't at the moment and you quite rightly point out Alex that this did happen in China,
[10:00.080 --> 10:06.720]  has been filmed in China and has been bought by Channel 4 to transmit here. One couldn't do this
[10:06.720 --> 10:11.680]  in the UK, one would be locked up, but apparently one can buy material and show it for public
[10:11.680 --> 10:17.520]  service consumption and not be locked up. They don't have laws, I don't know the laws in China,
[10:17.520 --> 10:21.760]  but I guess there's no law on having body parts and eating them there. Well, apparently not.
[10:24.400 --> 10:28.480]  Well, here in the US you can't even own body parts now, they made a law in the 60s unless
[10:28.480 --> 10:34.560]  you're a doctor or in medical teaching or a student, do you have a law on that in England?
[10:34.560 --> 10:41.840]  Well, can I just say that I mean I have been to China some 16 or 17 times and I'm fairly
[10:41.840 --> 10:46.000]  well acquainted with the country and its people in certain areas, it's such a vast country of
[10:46.000 --> 10:54.320]  course, and there is no doubt Alex that there is a deep divide in the cultural attitudes of the
[10:54.400 --> 10:59.440]  people of China as opposed to the people of the West. And I'm not defending this at all,
[10:59.440 --> 11:04.800]  but clearly when you go to foreign countries they behave in different ways, they have different rules
[11:04.800 --> 11:11.600]  and regs and they operate their lives in different ways. Even the divide between Americans and UK
[11:11.600 --> 11:17.280]  across the pond differs as you know to a fair degree as well. Well, the Chinese ambassador
[11:17.600 --> 11:24.160]  or the undersecretary is very upset about this, you know at least the Chinese who have a much
[11:24.160 --> 11:29.840]  lower view of life culturally just at least in the past, at least the communist Chinese don't want to
[11:29.840 --> 11:34.640]  have this on television, at least they know you're supposed to hide this type of stuff, you don't
[11:34.640 --> 11:40.480]  splatter it all over national television. So, two things on that, we have to keep this in proportion
[11:40.480 --> 11:48.080]  Alex, this guy is one of very very few that is conducting his art in such a controversial way.
[11:48.080 --> 11:56.880]  I'm with you 120% on the fact that it's outrageous and morally indefensible, but we have to put that
[11:56.880 --> 12:00.480]  in perspective, you know for every one guy that's doing this there's a million that are doing
[12:00.480 --> 12:05.760]  something else which we can actually relate to. As for the second thing, as for putting it on
[12:05.760 --> 12:12.240]  television, that is I believe indefensible and our organization has been rattling up every single
[12:12.240 --> 12:16.320]  address and telephone number that we can think of this last week. Well, here's the problem, where
[12:16.320 --> 12:23.920]  does it go next? How much further down the toilet bowl do we have to go here? I mean how much worse
[12:23.920 --> 12:30.080]  can it get now? I mean they're always trying to push the boundaries here. Sure, they are and
[12:30.080 --> 12:33.440]  in channel with channel four they are actually pushing them further and further back and it's
[12:33.440 --> 12:39.920]  very demoralizing. Even the BBC though I have to say over the Christmas period over here
[12:39.920 --> 12:47.120]  on the 22nd of December put out a documentary which was blasphemous in my view as a Christian
[12:47.120 --> 12:53.280]  and I was offended by it, questioning the virgin birth of Mary. So it doesn't just start with
[12:53.280 --> 12:58.960]  channel four, we've got quite a fight on our hands over here Alex. So they're trying to destroy any
[12:59.920 --> 13:07.760]  basis, any foundation of the society in the West. This is obviously a tool of social control to push
[13:07.760 --> 13:13.040]  the agenda, to change our worldview so we're more easily suggestible according to the government
[13:13.040 --> 13:17.920]  psychiatrist I've seen that have written about this as part of a larger plan. We've been talking
[13:17.920 --> 13:24.640]  to John Milton Watmore, chairman of MediaWatch and you can link through at Infowars.com to their
[13:24.640 --> 13:28.640]  fine site to learn more about what they're doing and what they're putting up with over there.
[13:29.440 --> 13:33.840]  Television here has turned into just a bunch of trash and they're always pushing the boundaries
[13:33.840 --> 13:37.920]  and I just can't see how much further it's going to go but obviously it's going to sink further.
[13:37.920 --> 13:44.960]  Are you starting to see a grassroots backlash against this? Well I wish I could report that
[13:44.960 --> 13:50.960]  we could but in actual fact we have completely restructured our organization over the last three
[13:50.960 --> 13:54.720]  or four years. We used to be known as the National Viewers and Listeners Association
[13:54.720 --> 13:59.520]  and we rebranded a few years ago called ourselves MediaWatch and we're trying to repackage all of
[13:59.520 --> 14:05.600]  the things which we believe are wholesome and part of a wholesome society with regard to the media
[14:05.600 --> 14:10.240]  so that younger people can relate to it and we have an active campaign with colleges, schools
[14:10.240 --> 14:14.880]  and universities and in fact we're putting together at the moment an award scheme for
[14:14.880 --> 14:20.080]  universities that we're going to distribute once a year on the basis of films that they can make
[14:20.080 --> 14:26.560]  which we think would be worth it but it's a very very hard job and I wish I could report that
[14:28.000 --> 14:32.160]  the position is getting better quickly but it's not and I think I agree with you it'll probably
[14:32.160 --> 14:39.040]  get worse before it gets better. Will it ever get better or will one day will we be obscene because
[14:39.040 --> 14:47.280]  we like mom and apple pie and you know football games? Will people that just want decency will we
[14:47.280 --> 14:53.520]  be labeled I guess like Sodom and Gomorrah or something as the bad people, the extremists
[14:53.520 --> 14:58.400]  because I've seen reaction in this country to wholesome things as if they are obscene.
[14:58.400 --> 15:04.000]  It seems like the world is now upside down. I think it's in fashion and in vogue at the moment
[15:04.000 --> 15:10.480]  to take the pillars and the foundations away from any establishment and certainly the Christian
[15:10.480 --> 15:17.200]  religion in the UK gets a bit of a battering. We just had a new appointment with an Archbishop
[15:17.200 --> 15:22.880]  of Canterbury and he's quite a controversial chap. He's a top druid, a high priest,
[15:22.880 --> 15:30.480]  as reported by your papers in the whole ritual up there? Well the church over here is very
[15:30.480 --> 15:36.560]  traditional and is slow to change. The free churches probably have a freer reign literally
[15:36.560 --> 15:42.480]  to change more quickly and in one sense it's his own enemy I think, it's the best enemy sometimes
[15:42.480 --> 15:47.920]  the church because it doesn't actually relate very quickly to things like this but certainly
[15:47.920 --> 15:55.920]  Christians over here get a bad time from the media on average. Oh I've seen it, totally ridiculed,
[15:55.920 --> 16:04.320]  but some sex slaughtering goats in the street is totally protected. Well John Milton Watmore,
[16:04.320 --> 16:07.920]  Chairman of Media Watch, what's your website real quick if folks want to go directly to it?
[16:08.800 --> 16:22.640]  Our website is www.info.netco. All right we've got a link to it on infowars.com and so this show
[16:22.640 --> 16:26.560]  it looks like it's going to go ahead in about four or five hours and air on national British
[16:26.560 --> 16:32.640]  television. Yes indeed and we're expecting a bit of fallout afterwards. Well there should be and
[16:32.640 --> 16:37.040]  we shouldn't let them continue to push the lines. Thank you for joining us and taking some time out
[16:37.040 --> 16:42.640]  John. My pleasure. Take care. Now there goes John Milton Watmore from the United Kingdom. We'll come
[16:42.640 --> 16:48.720]  back and talk to David and Daryl and many others if you'd like to join us on air. Our next guest
[16:48.720 --> 16:56.880]  isn't joining us for about 40 minutes. Joining us in the middle of the next hour 1-800-259-9231.
[16:57.600 --> 17:01.920]  Don't forget the American Psychological Association said pedophilia is good.
[17:01.920 --> 17:06.560]  They're trying to train you to be degenerate scum balls.
