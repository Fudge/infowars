[00:00:10.925 --> 00:00:19.988]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:19.988 --> 00:00:22.028]  Alright, welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:22.028 --> 00:00:24.809]  Mike Adams here for the first half of the show.
[00:00:24.809 --> 00:00:27.790]  It's February 26th already.
[00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:28.530]  Just amazing.
[00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.671]  We've got a bombshell show for you today.
[00:00:30.671 --> 00:00:36.533]  I've done a full analysis of what's going on and I believe that the CDC is setting a trap for Trump.
[00:00:37.423 --> 00:00:43.472]  And that Trump is about to commit perhaps political suicide this evening by addressing the nation at 6 p.m.
[00:00:43.472 --> 00:00:48.619]  Eastern to tell the nation that everything's fine with this coronavirus situation.
[00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:52.004]  I think that Trump's advisors are setting him up.
[00:00:52.796 --> 00:00:57.017]  To take the fall when this pandemic spreads in America.
[00:00:57.017 --> 00:01:01.998]  But not everybody agrees with me, so we're going to cover some different angles here, some different possibilities.
[00:01:01.998 --> 00:01:09.680]  One of the interesting things that has come out is Dr. Nancy Messonnier of the CDC, who's the one saying that this is going to spread in America.
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:16.842]  Reportedly, she is the sister, now I haven't confirmed this fully yet, but reportedly she's the sister of Rod Rosenstein.
[00:01:18.226 --> 00:01:21.827]  If that's true, then it starts to beg a lot of questions.
[00:01:21.827 --> 00:01:23.907]  What are the various agendas here?
[00:01:23.907 --> 00:01:27.888]  Is Rod working with William Barr against the deep state?
[00:01:27.888 --> 00:01:31.468]  Or is he still part of the deep state that's the anti-Trump agenda?
[00:01:31.468 --> 00:01:34.529]  And also today, Rush Limbaugh has chimed in on this.
[00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:45.071]  There was a caller yesterday at his show that mentioned my name and my work, and Rush said that basically this is really no big deal.
[00:01:45.071 --> 00:01:46.891]  That the coronavirus is no worse than the flu.
[00:01:47.967 --> 00:01:52.429]  But another radio host, Michael Savage, is outraged that Rush would say such a thing.
[00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:56.910]  Michael Savage, of course, is a brilliant scientist with a background in epidemiology.
[00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:06.414]  Michael Savage, I think, agrees with most of what I'm saying, and I'm citing the CDC when I say that there's virtually no testing taking place in the United States.
[00:02:06.414 --> 00:02:07.114]  Now on top of that,
[00:02:08.188 --> 00:02:16.155]  We have the Public Health Laboratory Association of America that is tired of waiting for the CDC to fix their test kits.
[00:02:16.155 --> 00:02:17.656]  Their test kits don't work.
[00:02:17.656 --> 00:02:26.004]  And as of this morning, the CDC's numbers show that only 426 Americans have been tested for the coronavirus by the CDC.
[00:02:26.004 --> 00:02:26.304]  That's it. 426.
[00:02:28.786 --> 00:02:31.308]  I mean, it's astonishing.
[00:02:31.308 --> 00:02:36.472]  How are you supposed to find community outbreaks if you're not testing for community outbreaks?
[00:02:36.472 --> 00:02:43.877]  When South Korea is testing 28,000 people and America's only testing 400, how are you supposed to detect community outbreaks?
[00:02:43.877 --> 00:02:51.443]  So you now have these labs or this lab association going to the FDA saying, give us permission to do our own tests so that we can test it.
[00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:55.812]  And I believe, in fact, I'm going to present evidence for you here today.
[00:02:55.812 --> 00:03:06.480]  I believe that the CDC is withholding test kits to set a trap for President Trump so that Trump can take the blame when the pandemic explodes in America.
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:15.507]  And Senator Schumer and even Mitt Romney are ready to pounce on Trump and blame him for the pandemic that's coming.
[00:03:15.507 --> 00:03:20.171]  I think we're looking at a possible Trump
[00:03:21.271 --> 00:03:21.671]  I think so.
[00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.532]  So we've got all those stories today, plus amazing clips.
[00:03:43.532 --> 00:03:46.194]  Oh, by the way, it's confirmed in Brazil now.
[00:03:46.194 --> 00:03:49.216]  This thing is in so many countries around the world now.
[00:03:49.216 --> 00:03:50.076]  It's in Germany.
[00:03:50.076 --> 00:03:50.777]  It's in Brazil.
[00:03:50.777 --> 00:03:52.058]  It's in Croatia.
[00:03:52.058 --> 00:03:52.758]  It's in Iraq.
[00:03:52.758 --> 00:03:53.558]  It's in Israel.
[00:03:53.558 --> 00:03:55.420]  It's spreading just like crazy.
[00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:56.480]  Uncontained.
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.221]  A new outbreak hub, of course, in Italy.
[00:03:58.221 --> 00:04:00.563]  Over 300 cases there confirmed yesterday.
[00:04:00.563 --> 00:04:02.184]  This is not contained.
[00:04:02.184 --> 00:04:09.309]  And everyone who was warned about the R-naught value of this, which is how quickly it multiplies in the population, everyone is being proven correct.
[00:04:10.273 --> 00:04:14.338]  All the predictions that we made here on InfoWars.com are being proven correct.
[00:04:14.338 --> 00:04:21.786]  And sadly, I'll talk about this, Rush Limbaugh is behind the curve on this, but maybe we can help bring Rush up to speed.
[00:04:21.786 --> 00:04:25.290]  He needs to get educated, and President Trump needs to get educated.
[00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:30.095]  So we're going to cover the vaccine, also six weeks away, of vaccine testing in humans?
[00:04:30.856 --> 00:04:31.457]  Are you kidding me?
[00:04:31.457 --> 00:04:32.458]  Human trials already?
[00:04:32.458 --> 00:04:34.660]  Did they skip all the animal trials?
[00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.343]  Is there going to be any quality control when they roll out a vaccine?
[00:04:37.343 --> 00:04:44.870]  And are they going to criminalize anti-vaxxers and throw them in prison when they roll out a mandatory vaccine for the coronavirus?
[00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.134]  We'll answer all those questions and much more today here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:04:48.134 --> 00:04:48.854]  This is Mike Adams.
[00:04:48.854 --> 00:04:49.615]  Stay with me.
[00:04:49.615 --> 00:04:50.216]  One-minute break.
[00:04:50.216 --> 00:04:52.018]  We'll be back with all that news and much more.
[00:04:59.818 --> 00:05:02.259]  We know that the globalists are in trouble.
[00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:09.262]  Humanity's waking up to their tyranny, how they run their scams, their Ponzi schemes, how they're building a post-human world.
[00:05:09.262 --> 00:05:11.123]  But we know they're going to strike back.
[00:05:11.123 --> 00:05:26.309]  And the UN has said that they're going to absolutely implode third world countries and then use those giant populations as weaponized hordes to come in and overwhelm the West and collapse our social services in a giant cloward and piven program.
[00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:27.329]  The U.N.
[00:05:27.329 --> 00:05:34.654]  also has said they'll use mass plagues to make us capitulate to world government, inner coronavirus.
[00:05:34.654 --> 00:05:43.800]  This is a critical year and it's a critical time to stay informed and to be spreading the word because people are waking up like never before.
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.302]  But this fight against tyranny is neck and neck.
[00:05:46.302 --> 00:05:51.946]  So spread the word about Band.Video and Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:05:51.946 --> 00:05:53.967]  That is so important.
[00:05:53.967 --> 00:05:56.089]  You are at the center of the resistance.
[00:05:56.749 --> 00:06:05.283]  You are our only hope.
[00:06:05.283 --> 00:06:10.292]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:13.709 --> 00:06:20.193]  This is one of the most important shows that you will ever see me hosting here on Infowars.com.
[00:06:20.193 --> 00:06:24.296]  We've got Professor Francis Boyle coming up at the top of the next hour.
[00:06:24.296 --> 00:06:29.700]  Alex Jones himself will be popping in at the bottom of this hour with an update from Washington, D.C.
[00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:33.082]  Judge Bergman and the Roger Stone trial, all of that.
[00:06:33.082 --> 00:06:37.605]  At the same time, I've got bombshell news about the CDC setting a trap for Trump.
[00:06:38.746 --> 00:06:40.167]  Well, welcome to the show.
[00:06:40.167 --> 00:06:47.233]  I'm Mike Adams, the health ranger here from Natural News, and you are watching Infowars.com Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:47.233 --> 00:06:48.794]  The CDC is setting a trap for Trump.
[00:06:48.794 --> 00:06:50.195]  That's the big headline for right now.
[00:06:50.195 --> 00:06:52.156]  Here's what we know so far.
[00:06:52.156 --> 00:06:55.779]  The CDC sent out hundreds of thousands of test kits around February 5.
[00:06:57.099 --> 00:07:02.161]  We soon found out, and this is mainstream news, this is not some wacko theory.
[00:07:02.161 --> 00:07:04.022]  We found out that those test kits did not work.
[00:07:04.022 --> 00:07:05.283]  It was reported everywhere.
[00:07:05.283 --> 00:07:07.584]  Wall Street Journal, CNBC, everywhere.
[00:07:07.584 --> 00:07:08.684]  Test kits did not work.
[00:07:08.684 --> 00:07:11.506]  They produced false positives and false negatives.
[00:07:11.506 --> 00:07:17.288]  At the same time, it now appears the CDC was ordering states not to conduct their own tests.
[00:07:17.288 --> 00:07:24.252]  And that's why, to date, only 426 tests for the coronavirus have been made nationwide.
[00:07:25.012 --> 00:07:29.515]  And those are CDC figures that I double-checked as of this morning.
[00:07:29.515 --> 00:07:30.975]  CDC official website.
[00:07:30.975 --> 00:07:32.656]  You can go, I mean, pull it up.
[00:07:32.656 --> 00:07:39.360]  CDC official website on the coronavirus currently says, or at least as of this morning, it said 426 tests nationwide.
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.300]  That's it.
[00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:45.063]  California, the testing that they have, quote, done for the coronavirus, they sent them to Atlanta.
[00:07:45.063 --> 00:07:46.264]  The CDC did the testing.
[00:07:47.193 --> 00:07:51.957]  I had staffers research the public health websites of all 50 states.
[00:07:51.957 --> 00:07:56.320]  Basically, almost none of them report any in-state testing.
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.342]  There is virtually no testing happening anywhere in America.
[00:07:59.342 --> 00:08:00.784]  In fact, I've got a story here.
[00:08:00.784 --> 00:08:01.584]  Here it is.
[00:08:01.584 --> 00:08:03.606]  This is CNBC from yesterday.
[00:08:03.606 --> 00:08:04.807]  Only three U.S.
[00:08:04.807 --> 00:08:08.990]  states can test for coronavirus, says Public Lab Group.
[00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:11.572]  This is the Association of Public Health Laboratories, APHL.
[00:08:13.166 --> 00:08:26.954]  They're saying that no one's testing for this and the CDC is prohibiting people from testing for it while the CDC is apparently, this is my theory, withholding test kits so that no one tests for community outbreaks in America.
[00:08:26.954 --> 00:08:31.277]  How are you supposed to know if there's an outbreak if you're not testing for one?
[00:08:31.957 --> 00:08:39.948]  And then you have Dr. Nancy Messonnier from the CDC, who's a very interesting person, reported to be the sister of Rod Rosenstein.
[00:08:39.948 --> 00:08:46.257]  Now, I haven't confirmed that yet, but I saw that on Zero Hedge and a couple other places, that may be the case.
[00:08:46.257 --> 00:08:48.780]  But she is the one who said the test kits are broken.
[00:08:49.401 --> 00:08:52.263]  They don't work and now she's quoted in the Wall Street Journal.
[00:08:52.263 --> 00:08:54.164]  I'll have quotes from her right here.
[00:08:54.164 --> 00:09:00.769]  Quote, now is the time for businesses, hospitals, communities, schools, and everyday people to begin preparing.
[00:09:00.769 --> 00:09:06.873]  We are asking the American public to work with us to prepare for the expectation that this could be bad.
[00:09:08.186 --> 00:09:08.566]  Here we go.
[00:09:08.566 --> 00:09:09.947]  We do have confirmation.
[00:09:09.947 --> 00:09:15.352]  Rod Rosenstein's sister is the CDC's Dr. Nancy Messonnier.
[00:09:15.352 --> 00:09:16.693]  So yeah, thank you for that.
[00:09:16.693 --> 00:09:19.375]  So now the plot thickens, folks.
[00:09:19.375 --> 00:09:20.236]  The plot thickens.
[00:09:20.236 --> 00:09:22.718]  How many agendas are flying around on all this?
[00:09:22.718 --> 00:09:25.340]  You've got President Trump that says everything's fine.
[00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:27.842]  He's going to address the nation tonight at 6 p.m.
[00:09:27.842 --> 00:09:33.027]  and he's going to tell people, at least reportedly, he's going to say, don't worry, the CDC has us under control.
[00:09:33.027 --> 00:09:34.388]  The WHO has us under control.
[00:09:34.648 --> 00:09:35.810]  We're working on a vaccine.
[00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:36.712]  Everything's going to be fine.
[00:09:36.712 --> 00:09:38.876]  There's no evidence of any outbreaks in America.
[00:09:38.876 --> 00:09:39.858]  Rush Limbaugh is out there.
[00:09:39.858 --> 00:09:41.461]  We're going to talk about him a little bit today.
[00:09:41.461 --> 00:09:43.405]  Rush Limbaugh says there's no problem.
[00:09:43.405 --> 00:09:44.206]  This is just the flu.
[00:09:46.069 --> 00:09:47.470]  We need to get Rush up to speed on this.
[00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:49.211]  We'll talk about that in a minute.
[00:09:49.211 --> 00:09:53.254]  Rush is a great American hero, but he's not yet up to speed on this.
[00:09:53.254 --> 00:10:01.099]  Then you've got Dr. Nancy Messonnier at the CDC, the sister of Rob Rosenstein, saying this thing's coming to America.
[00:10:01.099 --> 00:10:03.121]  Schools and hospitals get ready.
[00:10:03.121 --> 00:10:04.702]  The test kits have failed.
[00:10:04.702 --> 00:10:07.724]  There's no testing taking place anywhere across the country.
[00:10:07.724 --> 00:10:15.149]  The Lab Association of America is saying, FDA, give us permission to test for coronavirus because there's no testing being done.
[00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:15.733]  We're good.
[00:10:16.092 --> 00:10:20.594]  And then Nancy Messonnier says, we don't have any evidence of any outbreaks in America.
[00:10:20.594 --> 00:10:23.856]  She didn't say we don't have any outbreaks in America.
[00:10:23.856 --> 00:10:27.457]  She said we don't have any evidence of outbreaks in America.
[00:10:27.457 --> 00:10:28.518]  You understand the difference?
[00:10:28.518 --> 00:10:31.079]  Because there's no testing being done.
[00:10:31.079 --> 00:10:32.260]  No testing being done.
[00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:41.964]  Meanwhile, a reliable source of mine from the Department of Homeland Security told me days ago that they already have confirmation of 989 confirmed infections on a map
[00:10:45.686 --> 00:10:49.488]  Known to Homeland Security from a week ago!
[00:10:49.488 --> 00:10:57.332]  And if this thing, with an R-naught value of estimated up to 6.6, if this thing doubles every, what, 3.5 days or so?
[00:10:57.332 --> 00:10:59.993]  That means it's doubled twice in the last week.
[00:10:59.993 --> 00:11:05.496]  A thousand infections in America that were known over a week ago could be 4,000 infections right now.
[00:11:05.496 --> 00:11:07.757]  And that's assuming that they caught every infection.
[00:11:08.962 --> 00:11:15.968]  So I believe, realistically, mathematically, we have over 4,000 infections in America right now.
[00:11:15.968 --> 00:11:22.073]  And yesterday we had a super-secret classified briefing before the United States Senate.
[00:11:22.073 --> 00:11:26.997]  And NIH was briefing Senators and the CDC and Homeland Security.
[00:11:26.997 --> 00:11:28.618]  Classified briefing.
[00:11:28.618 --> 00:11:28.919]  Whoa!
[00:11:28.919 --> 00:11:30.300]  Why does this have to be a secret?
[00:11:31.471 --> 00:11:34.552]  If it's all good news, why can't you make it public?
[00:11:34.552 --> 00:11:37.094]  Why can't you just say, oh, public hearing?
[00:11:37.094 --> 00:11:39.015]  Hey, senators, everything's fine.
[00:11:39.015 --> 00:11:41.155]  There will be no outbreaks in America.
[00:11:41.155 --> 00:11:42.116]  Everything's awesome.
[00:11:42.116 --> 00:11:43.457]  Everybody buy more stocks.
[00:11:43.457 --> 00:11:44.977]  Proceed as normal.
[00:11:44.977 --> 00:11:47.578]  But no, it's a super secret hearing.
[00:11:47.578 --> 00:11:49.239]  So it's classified.
[00:11:49.239 --> 00:11:51.220]  What are they telling them that's classified?
[00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:55.082]  And I have an educated theory on this point.
[00:11:55.082 --> 00:11:58.243]  And I'm going to share that with you right now.
[00:11:58.243 --> 00:11:59.204]  We have four minutes on this.
[00:12:00.114 --> 00:12:00.834]  Here we go.
[00:12:00.834 --> 00:12:01.635]  Here's my theory.
[00:12:01.635 --> 00:12:04.696]  Can't prove it yet, but here's what I think has happened.
[00:12:04.696 --> 00:12:11.679]  I believe the United States of America has already been subjected to a bioweapons attack.
[00:12:11.679 --> 00:12:20.183]  That enemies of America, which include China, Iran, which has the virus, North Korea, and perhaps other nations, that they've already harvested this.
[00:12:21.476 --> 00:12:28.791]  They've already incubated it, multiplied it, which is easy to do in egg yolks, and they've already released it in American cities.
[00:12:28.791 --> 00:12:29.473]  That's my theory.
[00:12:29.473 --> 00:12:30.355]  I can't prove it.
[00:12:31.305 --> 00:12:32.286]  It's an educated theory.
[00:12:32.286 --> 00:12:35.668]  It's something I talked about weeks ago, probably happening.
[00:12:35.668 --> 00:12:49.956]  I believe, based on the evidence we're seeing right now, that the Department of Homeland Security is aware that a bioterrorism attack has taken place against America, that human weapons with this virus have been unleashed in U.S.
[00:12:49.956 --> 00:12:54.719]  cities by flying to America from nations where we don't have a travel ban.
[00:12:55.419 --> 00:12:58.202]  Again, I caution you, I can't prove this yet.
[00:12:58.202 --> 00:13:06.188]  This is a well-educated estimation of what might be happening, and that explains the super-secret classified hearing.
[00:13:06.188 --> 00:13:13.275]  And I believe that these officials from the CDC and the NIH, I believe that they're telling the Senators
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.763]  This is going to have outbreaks in America.
[00:13:16.763 --> 00:13:18.285]  We can't control it.
[00:13:18.285 --> 00:13:19.906]  It's broken containment.
[00:13:19.906 --> 00:13:22.650]  And we're going to have to have medical martial law.
[00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:25.713]  We're going to have to have quarantines in America.
[00:13:25.713 --> 00:13:30.459]  And I believe these officials are asking the Senators, please, Senators, tell us what should we do?
[00:13:32.082 --> 00:13:40.307]  Because you can't even say this news to the American people without, I suppose, putting them in a state of shock, since nobody's prepared for anything.
[00:13:40.307 --> 00:13:45.309]  The average American has less than $400 in terms of backup money for an emergency.
[00:13:45.309 --> 00:13:46.630]  They don't have backup food supplies.
[00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:48.071]  They don't have backup medicine.
[00:13:48.071 --> 00:13:49.032]  There's no vaccine ready.
[00:13:49.032 --> 00:13:51.213]  There's no drug proven to treat this.
[00:13:51.213 --> 00:13:53.894]  And the stock market is overbought.
[00:13:53.894 --> 00:13:58.557]  And we don't want to see the stock market crash, even though Democrats want to crash it.
[00:13:58.557 --> 00:14:00.118]  What are these officials going to do?
[00:14:01.363 --> 00:14:07.071]  Now, if you think that that case is not happening, maybe you say, OK, Mike, you're taking it too far.
[00:14:07.071 --> 00:14:09.154]  It's not a bioterrorism attack yet.
[00:14:09.154 --> 00:14:10.195]  It's just an outbreak.
[00:14:10.195 --> 00:14:12.078]  OK, it's just an outbreak.
[00:14:12.078 --> 00:14:13.780]  It's an outbreak in America.
[00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:15.783]  Then the CDC knows the outbreak is happening.
[00:14:15.783 --> 00:14:17.305]  The NIH knows it.
[00:14:17.305 --> 00:14:18.266]  What are we supposed to do then?
[00:14:19.247 --> 00:14:21.508]  I think it's a trap for Trump.
[00:14:21.508 --> 00:14:24.670]  I think Trump is being kept out of the loop.
[00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:30.893]  I think Trump is being misinformed on purpose so that they can blame Trump when the testing begins.
[00:14:30.893 --> 00:14:33.334]  Remember, the testing has not even begun in America.
[00:14:33.334 --> 00:14:37.597]  When the testing begins, we're going to see hundreds, if not thousands of cases almost immediately confirmed.
[00:14:38.337 --> 00:14:39.618]  Trump is going to take the blame.
[00:14:39.618 --> 00:14:42.721]  You're going to see Mitt Romney up there saying, ah, Trump was unprepared.
[00:14:42.721 --> 00:14:43.681]  He doesn't know what he's doing.
[00:14:43.681 --> 00:14:48.705]  You're going to have Senator Schumer saying, Trump took money away from the CDC, which is a lie.
[00:14:48.705 --> 00:14:50.127]  He didn't do that.
[00:14:50.127 --> 00:14:52.328]  Oh, Trump didn't have enough funding.
[00:14:52.328 --> 00:14:56.652]  He just approved, I think, was it a billion or two billion or 2.5 billion?
[00:14:56.652 --> 00:15:03.477]  The number keeps jumping around, but Trump just approved that, apparently, or at least a request from the White House to have more funding for this.
[00:15:03.477 --> 00:15:06.540]  Trump is going to get blamed, and he, in my opinion,
[00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:19.395]  Even though I'm a Trump supporter, and I hope Trump wins, in November, Trump is putting his political future at risk by downplaying the severity of this outbreak.
[00:15:19.395 --> 00:15:23.757]  And I don't even know exactly what Trump is supposed to say to America.
[00:15:23.757 --> 00:15:24.478]  What do you say?
[00:15:24.478 --> 00:15:33.782]  Oh, the stock market's overbought, pandemic outbreaks are coming, we don't have a vaccine, and maybe China just attacked us.
[00:15:33.782 --> 00:15:35.783]  How do you say that to America?
[00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:39.262]  So I don't know what Trump is supposed to do.
[00:15:39.262 --> 00:15:41.424]  He's in a real bind.
[00:15:41.424 --> 00:15:44.487]  But we'll try to help you survive it here at Infowars.com.
[00:15:44.487 --> 00:15:45.347]  We're going to break right now.
[00:15:45.347 --> 00:15:46.909]  We'll come back with a lot more straight ahead.
[00:15:46.909 --> 00:15:47.529]  I'm Mike Adams.
[00:15:47.529 --> 00:15:49.091]  Thank you for watching.
[00:15:49.091 --> 00:15:52.454]  We're going to talk about Rush Limbaugh, too, when we come back.
[00:15:52.454 --> 00:15:54.636]  Infowars.com, Alex Jones Show.
[00:15:54.636 --> 00:15:56.077]  Stay with us after this break.
[00:15:58.254 --> 00:15:59.475]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[00:15:59.475 --> 00:16:03.398]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[00:16:03.398 --> 00:16:04.939]  I sued the IRS and won.
[00:16:04.939 --> 00:16:07.882]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[00:16:07.882 --> 00:16:13.446]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[00:16:13.446 --> 00:16:14.647]  I can help you, too.
[00:16:14.647 --> 00:16:17.590]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.

[00:16:42.702 --> 00:16:48.103]  We even have reduced the total debt some of our clients were required to pay through what is known as an offer in compromise.
[00:16:48.203 --> 00:16:50.624]  Can you give us an example of somebody you help?
[00:16:50.624 --> 00:16:52.065]  Oh, can I ever?
[00:16:52.065 --> 00:16:57.208]  We have taken a $500,000 liability with the IRS.
[00:16:57.208 --> 00:16:57.988]  Guess what?
[00:16:57.988 --> 00:17:02.671]  The client didn't pay a dime through the representation known as non-collectible status with the government.
[00:17:03.012 --> 00:17:13.557]  If you owe the IRS more than $10,000 and you want to see if it's possible to pay a lot less, call OMG Tax right now for a free tax-saving consultation.

[00:18:58.755 --> 00:19:04.579]  I want to talk about Super Silver Whitening Toothpaste because I hadn't tried it except for maybe the last week and a half.
[00:19:04.579 --> 00:19:08.142]  And I told Alex, I said, man, this is the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[00:19:08.142 --> 00:19:10.444]  He's like, well, what are you doing just sitting in here telling me?
[00:19:10.444 --> 00:19:12.265]  You got to get up there and tell people.
[00:19:12.265 --> 00:19:19.851]  So here I am telling people Super Silver Whitening Toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[00:19:19.851 --> 00:19:20.311]  And I'm 45 years old.
[00:19:21.092 --> 00:19:23.053]  And I've tried a lot of different toothpaste.
[00:19:23.053 --> 00:19:24.754]  And it's fluoride free.
[00:19:24.754 --> 00:19:28.015]  I think the big difference, the game changer in this is the Coral Calcium.
[00:19:28.015 --> 00:19:31.617]  Because after I brush my teeth with this, they feel so clean.
[00:19:31.617 --> 00:19:36.299]  And the toothpaste, I don't even like rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this.
[00:19:36.299 --> 00:19:37.580]  It feels so good.
[00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:41.742]  It feels like good things are happening in my mouth.
[00:19:41.742 --> 00:19:47.945]  In fact, I find myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now.
[00:19:47.945 --> 00:19:49.606]  Because I like the way it feels.
[00:20:02.529 --> 00:20:10.015]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:10.015 --> 00:20:24.247]  What's going on, Bobby?
[00:20:24.247 --> 00:20:28.210]  There's a sick congressman from Illinois in D.C.
[00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:30.232]  He was in Chicago over the holiday.
[00:20:32.301 --> 00:20:34.322]  They're using the pod to fly him home.
[00:20:34.322 --> 00:20:36.743]  Then they're closing down Midway and O'Hare.
[00:20:36.743 --> 00:20:38.724]  The governor there is calling out the National Guard.
[00:20:38.724 --> 00:20:40.405]  They're setting up roadblocks.
[00:20:40.405 --> 00:20:43.126]  They're shutting down the Board of Trade, public transportation.
[00:20:43.126 --> 00:20:45.667]  Even the Teamsters are pulling their drivers off the road.
[00:20:45.667 --> 00:20:47.108]  People are still going to slip through, you know that?
[00:20:47.108 --> 00:20:48.308]  Yes, they will.
[00:20:48.308 --> 00:20:51.570]  The Secret Service is moving the President underground.
[00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:54.071]  Congress is figuring out how to work online.
[00:20:55.635 --> 00:21:01.759]  When the word goes out, there will be a run on the banks, gas stations, grocery stores, you name it.
[00:21:01.759 --> 00:21:02.780]  People will panic.
[00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:04.601]  The virus will be the least of our worries.
[00:21:04.601 --> 00:21:06.423]  It will tip over now.
[00:21:06.423 --> 00:21:11.366]  We just need to make sure that nobody knows until everybody knows.
[00:21:11.366 --> 00:21:14.528]  That's from the movie Contagion, the last line there.
[00:21:14.528 --> 00:21:19.111]  We just need to make sure nobody knows until everybody knows.
[00:21:20.232 --> 00:21:23.315]  Wow, what foreshadowing of current events.
[00:21:23.315 --> 00:21:26.618]  Just an incredible film to watch their contagion, I believe from the year 2011.
[00:21:26.618 --> 00:21:32.263]  Notably, the hero of the movie Contagion was of course the vaccine.
[00:21:32.263 --> 00:21:37.848]  And the bad guy in the movie, played by Jude Law, was someone who promoted herbs.
[00:21:38.826 --> 00:21:57.243]  And someone who was, you might call them today, an anti-vaxxer, played by Jude Law, and they even put false teeth in his mouth to give him kind of a crooked bucktooth look to say that, oh, these herb people, these anti-vax people are a little bit crazy and they have messed up teeth and they look funny.
[00:21:57.243 --> 00:22:03.789]  And at the end of the movie, he was indicted, criminally indicted, because he made money selling an herb when
[00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:07.213]  The vaccine was the hero of the film.
[00:22:07.213 --> 00:22:10.879]  So, of course, a total setup for exactly what we're seeing today.
[00:22:10.879 --> 00:22:13.703]  Now, we've got so much information here.
[00:22:15.318 --> 00:22:18.441]  One thing I want to mention, you've heard of the R-naught value.
[00:22:18.441 --> 00:22:20.882]  It's R followed by a subscript zero.
[00:22:20.882 --> 00:22:22.704]  It's called R-naught.
[00:22:22.704 --> 00:22:29.969]  And the R-naught value, according to mainstream science, describes the characteristics of the multiplying effect of the virus.
[00:22:29.969 --> 00:22:34.172]  How many people it spreads to for every one person that has it.
[00:22:34.172 --> 00:22:38.275]  So if one person spreads it to three people, it's called an R-naught value of three.
[00:22:39.398 --> 00:22:47.020]  This virus is believed to have an R0 value of 6.6, according to some research, which is through the roof.
[00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:51.481]  And this is explaining why we have so many outbreaks happening in Italy and around the world.
[00:22:51.481 --> 00:22:57.923]  In fact, if we can go to this map right now, we've got 1,261 in South Korea now, just exploding there.
[00:22:57.923 --> 00:23:05.585]  Italy confirmed 374 cases off the charts, sustained human-to-human transmission in Italy, Japan 178, and Iran
[00:23:07.665 --> 00:23:10.907]  Just leaping at 139.
[00:23:10.907 --> 00:23:12.968]  Singapore seems to be doing a good job right now.
[00:23:12.968 --> 00:23:14.629]  Taiwan is doing a good job.
[00:23:14.629 --> 00:23:18.771]  I don't trust the numbers out of Thailand and I don't trust the numbers in the United States.
[00:23:18.771 --> 00:23:19.531]  I think the U.S.
[00:23:19.531 --> 00:23:24.694]  has thousands of cases but they're just not yet tested for because of course there are no testing kits available.
[00:23:26.069 --> 00:23:30.496]  But I have a new theory, because I like to interject a little bit of satire into all this.
[00:23:30.496 --> 00:23:35.144]  I think the R-naught value has a new alternative definition.
[00:23:35.144 --> 00:23:37.749]  You talk about R-naught, here's what I think it should mean.
[00:23:39.016 --> 00:23:44.660]  If you keep waiting, you are not going to be able to buy food.
[00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:50.064]  If you don't take action, you are not going to be able to make it through this pandemic.
[00:23:50.064 --> 00:23:52.645]  That's my version of the are not value.
[00:23:52.645 --> 00:23:55.848]  You are not going to be helped by the federal government.
[00:23:55.848 --> 00:24:01.271]  You are not going to want FEMA at your door with a gun telling you to go to a FEMA camp.
[00:24:01.271 --> 00:24:03.973]  So that's, I'm going to call this the are not sale.
[00:24:05.054 --> 00:24:14.242]  Like, if you need food supplies right now, MyPatriotSupply is about the only place in America that's got any food left, and it's at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:24:14.242 --> 00:24:20.467]  In fact, last night, a friend of mine who runs another major online retailer, he called me just about in a panic.
[00:24:21.007 --> 00:24:27.993]  And he said all these companies that he had bought from, like Mountain House, they make like the freeze-dried camping food that you buy at Walmart.
[00:24:27.993 --> 00:24:29.634]  He said they're just, they're wiped out.
[00:24:29.634 --> 00:24:30.876]  These other companies are wiped out.
[00:24:30.876 --> 00:24:37.081]  He said he just bought $50,000 worth of food from another supplier to try to fulfill his customer orders.
[00:24:37.081 --> 00:24:38.322]  And he said that's it.
[00:24:38.322 --> 00:24:38.842]  They're done.
[00:24:38.842 --> 00:24:41.204]  And these other companies are not even taking orders anymore.
[00:24:41.204 --> 00:24:42.285]  They're out.
[00:24:42.285 --> 00:24:45.388]  Our own Health Ranger store is out of food.
[00:24:45.388 --> 00:24:46.829]  We're waiting on supplies right now.
[00:24:46.829 --> 00:24:48.251]  We can't get any more food at the moment.
[00:24:48.991 --> 00:24:51.877]  Infowarsstore.com has the food.
[00:24:51.877 --> 00:24:55.043]  MyPatriotSupply has the food.
[00:24:55.043 --> 00:24:58.670]  And I know, I mean, yeah, it's storable food.
[00:24:58.670 --> 00:24:59.752]  It's got a long shelf life.
[00:25:00.785 --> 00:25:06.488]  And people are asking me, like, are you going to eat this food yourself?
[00:25:06.488 --> 00:25:09.169]  If it's that versus starving, you bet I am.
[00:25:09.169 --> 00:25:15.653]  I'm not going to go out to my backyard and just cut grass and juice grass and try to drink wheatgrass all through the pandemic.
[00:25:15.653 --> 00:25:17.354]  I'd love to have some food.
[00:25:17.354 --> 00:25:21.536]  And if you want to have some food, just take advantage of this are not sale.
[00:25:21.536 --> 00:25:23.497]  That's what I'm calling it.
[00:25:23.497 --> 00:25:23.997]  It's a joke.
[00:25:23.997 --> 00:25:25.398]  It's a play on the are not term.
[00:25:26.098 --> 00:25:28.642]  Infowarsstore.com, get your food supplies right now.
[00:25:28.642 --> 00:25:32.827]  There's gonna come a day in America where you can't get anything.
[00:25:33.666 --> 00:25:34.927]  That day is coming.
[00:25:34.927 --> 00:25:38.849]  Nancy Messonnier even warned about that, if you believe what she's saying.
[00:25:38.849 --> 00:25:41.110]  I'll talk about that a little bit more in a second.
[00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:43.812]  In Italy, one day, everything was fine.
[00:25:43.812 --> 00:25:46.314]  You could go to the store, you could get supplies.
[00:25:46.314 --> 00:25:55.879]  And then suddenly, overnight, in Italy, because of all those infections, again now, 374 confirmed infections, now you can't get any supplies because you can't travel.
[00:25:55.879 --> 00:25:59.261]  They locked down 10 or 12 towns in Italy.
[00:25:59.261 --> 00:26:00.482]  Overnight!
[00:26:00.482 --> 00:26:01.543]  Armed roadblocks!
[00:26:02.691 --> 00:26:06.775]  Police with submachine guns on the roads in Italy.
[00:26:06.775 --> 00:26:10.598]  You think that can't happen in America?
[00:26:10.598 --> 00:26:11.799]  Of course it can.
[00:26:11.799 --> 00:26:14.441]  In fact, I think it's inevitable.
[00:26:14.441 --> 00:26:16.283]  Now, we're going to talk about Rush Limbaugh for just a second here.
[00:26:20.279 --> 00:26:26.822]  Amazing caller called into Russia's show yesterday, and I don't know who this caller is, but I thank the person.
[00:26:26.822 --> 00:26:29.363]  He's well-spoken, and he mentioned me.
[00:26:29.363 --> 00:26:33.105]  Let's go to that clip and see what he said and what Russia's response was.
[00:26:33.105 --> 00:26:34.106]  Go ahead.
[00:26:34.106 --> 00:26:35.006]  News.com.
[00:26:35.006 --> 00:26:37.027]  The gentleman's name is Mike Adams.
[00:26:37.027 --> 00:26:40.729]  I don't know if this is credible, but he claims to be using U.S.
[00:26:40.729 --> 00:26:44.731]  government and CDC and other U.S.
[00:26:44.731 --> 00:26:47.232]  government websites and statistics
[00:26:47.958 --> 00:26:48.258]  It's
[00:27:07.815 --> 00:27:08.736]  People in the U.S.
[00:27:08.736 --> 00:27:14.560]  have this or how serious it is and the CDC kits are not reliable.
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:19.524]  I'm not really sure if this is to be believed and then we don't yet have a handle on this.
[00:27:19.524 --> 00:27:23.687]  Well, I can't I can't I can't help you because I never heard of the guy.
[00:27:23.687 --> 00:27:25.748]  I mean, I know a lot of Mike Adams.
[00:27:25.748 --> 00:27:29.771]  I don't know this guy on this website.
[00:27:29.771 --> 00:27:30.392]  I can't help you.
[00:27:32.273 --> 00:27:36.254]  These are the kind of things that... They're a challenge!
[00:27:36.254 --> 00:27:40.355]  Everybody wants to know more than what is being reported on something.
[00:27:40.355 --> 00:27:48.917]  And you glom on the... If you're worried and scared and if you think this is going to be bad and you run across a site that confirms your fears, then you tend to believe them.
[00:27:48.917 --> 00:27:50.857]  So that's Rush Limbaugh commenting.
[00:27:50.857 --> 00:27:52.538]  First of all, I thank that caller.
[00:27:52.538 --> 00:27:54.238]  I don't know the caller.
[00:27:54.238 --> 00:27:56.179]  And that was not an arranged call from me.
[00:27:57.279 --> 00:27:59.020]  I thank the caller for asking the question.
[00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:11.284]  I just want to point out that the caller, it was very accurate in their description that I'm citing the CDC and the state of California, the state of Washington, the state of Hawaii, that there's no testing virtually going on in America.
[00:28:11.284 --> 00:28:14.966]  Now Rush Limbaugh, look, Rush Limbaugh is a living legend.
[00:28:15.914 --> 00:28:18.015]  I'm a subscriber to Rush 24-7.
[00:28:18.015 --> 00:28:19.935]  I pay to listen to Rush Limbaugh.
[00:28:19.935 --> 00:28:22.616]  I've listened to his show for years.
[00:28:22.616 --> 00:28:24.557]  Rush Limbaugh is a great American.
[00:28:24.557 --> 00:28:29.759]  He just had the Presidential Medal of Freedom awarded to him and he earned it.
[00:28:29.759 --> 00:28:32.660]  But Rush Limbaugh needs to get up to speed on this.
[00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:36.361]  He doesn't yet have the information that he needs and I believe Rush has a responsibility
[00:28:37.423 --> 00:28:40.645]  to get better information about this so that he can inform his audience.
[00:28:40.645 --> 00:28:43.906]  I'm a fan of Rush, but he's behind the curve on this issue.
[00:28:43.906 --> 00:28:45.647]  He's not a scientist.
[00:28:45.647 --> 00:28:52.370]  He's a brilliant analyst in the world of politics, but he doesn't know what's happening with this exponential spread of the virus.
[00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:55.252]  I pray for you, Rush, but please get educated.
[00:28:55.252 --> 00:28:55.832]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:58.348 --> 00:29:00.309]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:29:00.309 --> 00:29:05.633]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:29:05.633 --> 00:29:07.215]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:29:07.215 --> 00:29:15.581]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:29:15.581 --> 00:29:21.265]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:29:21.425 --> 00:29:23.266]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:29:23.266 --> 00:29:25.426]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:29:25.426 --> 00:29:29.928]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:29:29.928 --> 00:29:32.128]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:29:32.128 --> 00:29:39.971]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[00:29:59.474 --> 00:30:02.075]  Alex Jones here with two big announcements.
[00:30:02.075 --> 00:30:09.057]  Ultra 12 and Vitamin Mineral Fusion are both back in stock after being sold out for months.
[00:30:09.057 --> 00:30:19.501]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion is high quality vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and other key cofactors that are so good for you and your family, especially your children's bodies and your immune systems.
[00:30:19.941 --> 00:30:26.205]  Ultra 12 is the highest quality vitamin B12 taken sublingually under the tongue.
[00:30:26.205 --> 00:30:27.186]  It is back in stock.
[00:30:27.186 --> 00:30:36.412]  You can get them both individually for 40% off right now and get them together as a combo for 50% off.
[00:30:36.412 --> 00:30:43.856]  This makes your life so much better when you have a good multivitamin mineral that you actually absorb and as a tasty fruit punch.
[00:30:43.856 --> 00:30:44.317]  And of course,
[00:30:45.177 --> 00:30:51.900]  Vladimir 12 is the bedrock foundation of energy, stamina, libido, just everything.
[00:30:51.900 --> 00:31:00.023]  And they're both back in stock, 40% off individually or 50% off when you get them together at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:31:00.023 --> 00:31:00.804]  Real stuff, man.
[00:31:00.804 --> 00:31:02.204]  We're talking about the real deal here.
[00:31:02.204 --> 00:31:07.727]  And I love Trump all day long, but man, I tell you, he sits here and lets these big tech people keep running roughshod over him, everybody.
[00:31:08.789 --> 00:31:10.289]  I mean, I've got a problem.
[00:31:10.289 --> 00:31:12.010]  And we'll just take the Trump rallies over.
[00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:15.791]  That said, about two months ago, I came up with a plan that I haven't launched yet.
[00:31:15.791 --> 00:31:19.652]  We have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers.
[00:31:19.652 --> 00:31:20.872]  20 different stickers.
[00:31:20.872 --> 00:31:22.512]  Impeach the Democrats.
[00:31:22.512 --> 00:31:23.573]  Save the Second Amendment.
[00:31:23.573 --> 00:31:24.673]  Defend the First Amendment.
[00:31:24.673 --> 00:31:25.993]  Infowars.com.
[00:31:25.993 --> 00:31:28.174]  And it looks like duct tape, but it's just a regular sticker.
[00:31:28.174 --> 00:31:32.915]  You put it over your mouth, you go to a Trump rally, and you instantly take over without even disrupting things.
[00:31:32.915 --> 00:31:34.515]  People say, why are you doing this?
[00:31:34.515 --> 00:31:35.055]  What's happening?
[00:31:35.055 --> 00:31:36.536]  Well, you go, well, we're being censored.
[00:31:37.176 --> 00:31:38.677]  You know, Trump won't do anything about it.
[00:31:38.677 --> 00:31:42.000]  And Dr. Puccini, let me just ask you what you think, because I've not launched this yet.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:42.981]  It's brilliant.
[00:31:42.981 --> 00:31:50.067]  You've taken the very element that they try to repress you with, that's silence, and made it into a weapon.
[00:31:50.067 --> 00:31:53.009]  You have the loudest sound of all, silence.
[00:31:53.009 --> 00:31:55.832]  And you know what's most disturbing to people?
[00:31:55.832 --> 00:31:56.452]  Silence.
[00:31:58.587 --> 00:32:02.408]  Since the beginning, Secret 12 has been one of our most popular formulas.

[00:33:01.957 --> 00:33:12.590]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:15.273]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:15.273 --> 00:33:20.399]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:33:24.433 --> 00:33:27.376]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:33:27.376 --> 00:33:35.263]  I am Alex Jones, your host, coming to you from deep in the heart of the swamp that is beginning to show signs of drainage.
[00:33:35.263 --> 00:33:40.267]  Crocodiles and alligators and anacondas and piranhas are not pleased.
[00:33:40.267 --> 00:33:46.273]  I can tell you that Mike Adams is doing an exemplary job running the ship.
[00:33:46.273 --> 00:33:47.273]  When we got to D.C.
[00:33:47.273 --> 00:33:50.036]  last night, I thought, let me tune into the rebroadcast.
[00:33:51.002 --> 00:34:00.388]  It's about to restart on the streams, and I ended up watching two hours of Mike Adams and Alan Keyes and G. Edward Griffin.
[00:34:00.388 --> 00:34:02.769]  And then this morning I got up at 5 a.m.
[00:34:02.769 --> 00:34:05.210]  and watched some of Paul Watson.
[00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:08.432]  So an out-of-the-park broadcast yesterday.
[00:34:08.432 --> 00:34:15.977]  We really want to thank Mike Adams and Dr. Keyes for the amazing job that they engaged in yesterday.
[00:34:17.769 --> 00:34:23.493]  Obviously now the federal government says get food and prepare a shelter in place.
[00:34:23.493 --> 00:34:38.863]  Whether this virus is super deadly or not, as we keep saying, the giant response to it and the martial law in Russia where they're raiding Chinese and dragging them out and martial law in Northern Italy, the response is massive.
[00:34:38.863 --> 00:34:41.085]  And obviously it's being used to drive down the economy.
[00:34:42.208 --> 00:34:45.591]  I know he's already been extensively talking about it, but I wanted to first get into this.
[00:35:00.146 --> 00:35:11.229]  Who was appointed especially by Obama to sit at the center of the spiderweb in DC so they could send cases from all over the country that she was going to cover up corruption or cover up crimes to her.
[00:35:11.229 --> 00:35:17.731]  But she could also then prosecute and persecute people like Roger Stone.
[00:35:17.731 --> 00:35:27.354]  She has been caught one trillion infinities in the most classic pan in the cookie jar stealing
[00:35:28.552 --> 00:35:31.154]  Uh, justice away from people that has ever been seen.
[00:35:31.154 --> 00:35:49.064]  She literally put in a jury for a woman who was the communications director for the Office of White House Communications, a major position, as the first jury woman whose husband worked in the Robert Mueller probe as a lawyer on the Russiagate.
[00:35:49.694 --> 00:35:51.795]  That is beyond Fox in the henhouse.
[00:35:51.795 --> 00:35:56.296]  That'd be like Hitler presiding over the Nuremberg trials against the Nazis.
[00:35:56.296 --> 00:35:58.937]  Or let's say my ex-wife was a judge.
[00:35:58.937 --> 00:35:59.537]  Well, she's not.
[00:35:59.537 --> 00:36:05.939]  But imagine if I was in a divorce and the judge is your wife.
[00:36:05.939 --> 00:36:07.780]  It's beyond conflict of interest.
[00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:10.261]  It's redonkulous.
[00:36:10.261 --> 00:36:12.401]  It is so obscene.
[00:36:12.401 --> 00:36:14.022]  So I talked to reporters.
[00:36:14.022 --> 00:36:16.422]  They were all scared to say it.
[00:36:16.422 --> 00:36:17.503]  But I said, give me the name.
[00:36:17.503 --> 00:36:17.903]  I'll say it.
[00:36:18.829 --> 00:36:21.951]  Because I went and checked with lawyers, but I already knew before I called them.
[00:36:21.951 --> 00:36:25.572]  Jurors are always public, especially after.
[00:36:25.572 --> 00:36:31.655]  Even in mafia trials, maybe super hardcore MS-13s threaten to kill people, threaten to kill jurors.
[00:36:31.655 --> 00:36:36.718]  Sometimes there's special allotments where the jurors aren't public until afterwards.
[00:36:36.718 --> 00:36:39.259]  But then we exposed it.
[00:36:39.259 --> 00:36:43.541]  The Washington Post had Obama officials calling for our arrest, Obama former U.S.
[00:36:43.541 --> 00:36:43.901]  attorneys.
[00:36:44.753 --> 00:36:45.554]  Total BS.
[00:36:45.554 --> 00:36:47.255]  Just like they said, arrest anybody.
[00:36:47.255 --> 00:36:50.158]  Arrest Senator Rand Paul for saying Eric Siromala's name.
[00:36:50.158 --> 00:36:51.719]  Totally legal, totally lawful.
[00:36:51.719 --> 00:36:55.342]  When a whistleblower goes to the Inspector General, they can't release it.
[00:36:55.342 --> 00:36:56.563]  Just like when I go to the hospital.
[00:36:57.483 --> 00:36:59.623]  They can't release my HIPAA stuff.
[00:36:59.623 --> 00:37:05.205]  But then if I go out on national TV and say I've got some illness, well that's not the hospital releasing HIPAA info.
[00:37:05.205 --> 00:37:09.385]  When you accuse the president of crimes, now he gets to face his accuser.
[00:37:09.385 --> 00:37:10.346]  It's called due process.
[00:37:10.346 --> 00:37:16.567]  So we all know about that and the fake stuff that happened with the FISA court with all of the fake info they were given.
[00:37:16.567 --> 00:37:25.069]  The FISA court has said they were lied to by all these Obama and Hillary Justice Department appointees and operatives inside the FBI.
[00:37:25.069 --> 00:37:26.629]  We all know about that ad nauseum.
[00:37:27.375 --> 00:37:31.278]  But they thought President Trump would be removed by now.
[00:37:31.278 --> 00:37:42.425]  They thought that they were going to get rid of him and then they would have the sentencing of Stone as another cherry on top, legitimizing what they'd done.
[00:37:42.425 --> 00:37:46.048]  The best laid plans of mice and men often go astray.
[00:37:46.048 --> 00:37:51.592]  That didn't work the way they wanted it to at all.
[00:37:51.592 --> 00:37:55.054]  So now, Russiagate blows up, falls apart.
[00:37:55.054 --> 00:37:56.135]  Ukrainegate falls apart.
[00:37:58.624 --> 00:38:07.126]  She, after we exposed the jury for woman that she had put in, it was in the transcript, it turns out, in front of the media three months ago.
[00:38:07.126 --> 00:38:10.787]  The woman says, yeah, I work for Obama, headed up a department.
[00:38:10.787 --> 00:38:13.147]  My husband works in the Justice Department.
[00:38:13.147 --> 00:38:16.128]  And she's like, no problem, no big deal, no problem.
[00:38:16.128 --> 00:38:17.968]  We get the name.
[00:38:17.968 --> 00:38:20.829]  She headed up a department and her husband was high level in the Mueller probe.
[00:38:20.829 --> 00:38:21.829]  Unbelievable.
[00:38:21.829 --> 00:38:24.490]  So they finally have to remove her.
[00:38:24.490 --> 00:38:25.230]  They get the new jury.
[00:38:27.227 --> 00:38:31.110]  Bill Protege ran for national and high office.
[00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:34.453]  Democrat Party operative has worked for the DNC.
[00:38:34.453 --> 00:38:36.334]  The DNC.
[00:38:36.334 --> 00:38:38.916]  That is unbelievable.
[00:38:38.916 --> 00:38:43.260]  It'd be like putting Sylvester in charge of Tweety Bird's care.
[00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:45.201]  No one has ever acted like this.
[00:38:45.201 --> 00:38:48.283]  Not even third world kangaroo courts in Venezuela.
[00:38:48.283 --> 00:38:50.986]  This is unbelievable.
[00:38:50.986 --> 00:38:55.209]  But see, they thought Trump would be gone by now, so they thought they had the media.
[00:38:55.209 --> 00:38:56.430]  They thought they could get away with this.
[00:38:57.409 --> 00:39:04.431]  So I went and bullhorned, drove around four times over an hour and a half period around the federal courthouse.
[00:39:04.431 --> 00:39:05.872]  She's reportedly there today.
[00:39:05.872 --> 00:39:16.135]  And then I went on the front steps and bullhorned her for another 30 minutes with everybody looking out the windows at us and pointed out that you've been caught committing a major crime, but it gets worse.
[00:39:16.135 --> 00:39:22.476]  Back when we exposed it, she told the people in the courtroom and the media, you do not cover this.
[00:39:22.476 --> 00:39:24.157]  You do not tell anybody about this.
[00:39:25.905 --> 00:39:28.066]  You don't say the names of these juries.
[00:39:28.066 --> 00:39:30.847]  Well, she doesn't have that power.
[00:39:30.847 --> 00:39:32.508]  So then we put the information out.
[00:39:32.508 --> 00:39:34.269]  Then we learn about the new lady.
[00:39:34.269 --> 00:39:35.069]  Now she doesn't.
[00:39:35.069 --> 00:39:39.251]  Here's the key to everything I should have gotten to up front.
[00:39:39.251 --> 00:39:42.392]  The judge is a deer in the headlights.
[00:39:42.392 --> 00:39:49.916]  She is trying to suppress the names of the other jurors and their jury questionnaires now, even from the lawyers, even though that's part of the record.
[00:39:50.609 --> 00:40:01.774]  Even though the Supreme Court has ruled that that should all be public information, because it's going to come out that more of them are Democrat Party operatives and more of them are globalists.
[00:40:01.774 --> 00:40:05.156]  And so, not one, not two, it's going to be a lot more.
[00:40:05.156 --> 00:40:11.539]  And the transcripts of the judge saying, it's okay if you work for the DNC, it's okay if you work for Obama.
[00:40:11.539 --> 00:40:15.120]  And then they lied on the questionnaires and said, oh, I don't even know who Roger Stone is.
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:18.782]  Meanwhile, before they said they hated him, during the trial, they said he's going to go to jail.
[00:40:19.477 --> 00:40:40.515]  So, we've caught them red-handed, the judge protecting it, a giant criminal operation because she was under orders by Obama and Hillary and the deep state to carry this out, and now the wheels are totally coming off, and these massive crimes that they've committed are just devastatingly insane, and Trump is tweeting and talking about it, and the judge says that's intimidation of jurors.
[00:40:40.515 --> 00:40:43.878]  She talked about me yesterday and said, I've been trying to intimidate jurors.
[00:40:43.878 --> 00:40:47.201]  The jury already rendered their fraudulent verdict.
[00:40:47.662 --> 00:40:49.366]  They're already gone.
[00:40:49.366 --> 00:40:51.131]  It's dissolved.
[00:40:51.131 --> 00:40:55.663]  So how the hell is it intimidating jurors to
[00:40:56.838 --> 00:40:59.179]  Talk about a jury that isn't even there anymore.
[00:40:59.179 --> 00:41:00.299]  It's total crap.
[00:41:00.299 --> 00:41:08.201]  She's desperate to cover up her crimes and doesn't want the jurors talking about how they're all DNC operatives and how much trouble these criminals are going to get in.
[00:41:08.201 --> 00:41:10.281]  They have really bitten off more than they can chew.
[00:41:10.281 --> 00:41:20.304]  I want to play some of the clips with Andrew Napolitano and Tucker Carlson next segment getting into this and finish up with the latest coronavirus news before Dr. Francis Boyle, the author of the U.S.
[00:41:20.304 --> 00:41:24.125]  Biological Weapons Convention, who's been dead on this whole time about being man-made.
[00:41:24.565 --> 00:41:26.547]  It's more deadly than what we're saying.
[00:41:26.547 --> 00:41:28.409]  Looks like he's been proven right at spades.
[00:41:28.409 --> 00:41:34.095]  But Mike Adams, this is bigger than just this Judge Jackson, Amy Bergman Jackson.
[00:41:34.095 --> 00:41:37.819]  This is their whole house of cards coming down, just like the FISA Court.
[00:41:37.819 --> 00:41:41.083]  I don't know how the Justice Department doesn't prosecute this witch-like creature.
[00:41:42.287 --> 00:41:47.649]  Well, it's very clear that they have to control the narrative in order to prevent their people from going to jail.
[00:41:47.649 --> 00:42:03.214]  If justice is really served in this country, then there's a whole long list of people that go to jail, especially those who signed the fraudulent FISA court documents that began the entire investigation into people like Roger Stone and other Trump affiliates, even though Stone wasn't officially on the campaign.
[00:42:03.214 --> 00:42:05.795]  So yeah, this is the House of Cards, and by the way,
[00:42:06.175 --> 00:42:09.737]  They are trying to use this pandemic, Alex, to take out Trump.
[00:42:09.737 --> 00:42:13.019]  And that's, I don't know if you heard the opening segment, that's what I'm warning about today.
[00:42:13.019 --> 00:42:15.940]  You know, of course, they're not going to let a crisis go to waste.
[00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:18.782]  Everything that they can use to destroy Trump, they will use.
[00:42:18.782 --> 00:42:20.063]  And they're going to use this too.
[00:42:20.063 --> 00:42:21.824]  That's the big warning today.
[00:42:21.824 --> 00:42:27.807]  So we've got to reach Trump and educate him about this, what's really going on, how the CDC is lying to him.
[00:42:27.807 --> 00:42:28.367]  Absolutely.
[00:42:28.367 --> 00:42:31.609]  And I understand that Trump doesn't want to hype something up that can hurt the economy.
[00:42:32.592 --> 00:42:35.535]  I believe we are going to make it through this virus, but it's man-made.
[00:42:35.535 --> 00:42:36.635]  It's a chimera.
[00:42:36.635 --> 00:42:40.739]  Obama, again, can't make this up, sold it to China five years ago.
[00:42:40.739 --> 00:42:41.700]  He authorized it.
[00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:43.281]  It was in the Scientist magazine.
[00:42:43.281 --> 00:42:44.362]  It was in the news.
[00:42:44.362 --> 00:42:46.484]  The scientific community said, this is crazy.
[00:42:46.484 --> 00:42:46.944]  What are you doing?
[00:42:46.944 --> 00:42:49.006]  We're going to break, Alex.
[00:42:49.006 --> 00:42:50.207]  We'll be right back after this break.
[00:42:50.207 --> 00:42:50.707]  Stay with us.
[00:42:50.707 --> 00:42:53.249]  Alex Jones, Mike Adams, and Francis Boyle coming up.
[00:42:53.249 --> 00:42:53.690]  Stay with us.
[00:42:58.129 --> 00:43:06.558]  At the end of World War II, Adolf Hitler had discredited the eugenics and world population control organizations.
[00:43:06.558 --> 00:43:15.708]  They openly had meetings and led by Julian Huxley, Aldous Huxley's brother, decided to repackage themselves as transhumanist.
[00:43:15.708 --> 00:43:19.231]  Now in the year 2020, to set the precedent that
[00:43:19.992 --> 00:43:25.415]  People can be turned into cyborgs, that robots can be given rights, you name it.
[00:43:25.415 --> 00:43:32.380]  They are intimidating and arresting people all over the world who simply misgender someone.
[00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:39.364]  So the ultimate crime will be even asking what someone is if you can't even tell what they are.
[00:43:39.904 --> 00:43:42.705]  This is the ultimate Kafkaesque mind control.
[00:43:42.705 --> 00:43:47.327]  And there's several big articles up on Infowars.com that break this down.
[00:43:47.327 --> 00:43:59.611]  UK teen fined under house arrest for asking trans police officers, gender, UK mother, spare jail for misgendering trans woman, ordered to pay 1,000 pound fine.
[00:43:59.611 --> 00:44:01.091]  All right, folks, here's the bad news.
[00:44:01.091 --> 00:44:08.974]  We've already sold out of the 16 ounce immune gargle with the patented nanotech silver that's documented to knock out viruses and bacteria unlike anything else.
[00:44:09.673 --> 00:44:13.817]  But, we do still have it in the 3 oz and the 1 oz for a limited time.
[00:44:13.817 --> 00:44:22.405]  The good news is, we have the Super Blue toothpaste and the Super Silver toothpaste, both that have the Nano Silver in them as well.
[00:44:22.405 --> 00:44:25.989]  The Super Blue has tea tree, that's also antiviral and antibacterial.
[00:44:26.449 --> 00:44:28.150]  And high quality iodine.
[00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:35.552]  And then of course the whitening has the nano silver, but on top of that it has the above sea coral calcium that re-memorizes the teeth.
[00:44:35.552 --> 00:44:37.792]  And so it's just the best toothpaste you're going to find.
[00:44:37.792 --> 00:44:38.732]  Period.
[00:44:38.732 --> 00:44:43.914]  It has the nano silver and we still have supplies of it, though it'll sell out at current rates in about two weeks.
[00:44:43.914 --> 00:44:50.796]  But despite that, I'm keeping it at sale at 50% off so everybody can protect themselves with this high quality product.
[00:44:50.796 --> 00:44:52.996]  If you've never used it before, get yours today.
[00:44:52.996 --> 00:44:54.077]  Infowarestore.com.
[00:44:55.257 --> 00:44:59.080]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:00.221]  Don't be a victim.
[00:45:00.221 --> 00:45:05.105]  If you're worried about the coronavirus, exercise, but not too hard, because that can lower your immune system.
[00:45:05.105 --> 00:45:09.389]  Drink extra purified clean water, so that no toxins weigh you down, but you have plenty of hydration.
[00:45:09.389 --> 00:45:11.791]  Prayer and meditation has been proven to make you healthier.
[00:45:11.791 --> 00:45:15.253]  Get plenty of vitamin C, get plenty of vitamin D3, which is fish oil.
[00:45:15.253 --> 00:45:17.215]  Take your colloidal silver, all of it, fats.
[00:45:17.395 --> 00:45:20.518]  That's what allows you to be healthier and get plenty of sleep.
[00:45:20.518 --> 00:45:30.367]  We have sold out of the 16 ounce immune gargle that has the nano silver that's patented and documented and even admitted in documents we've shown that go after this whole Corona SARS family of virus.
[00:45:30.367 --> 00:45:32.929]  We're almost sold out of the one ounce spray bottles.
[00:45:32.929 --> 00:45:37.494]  That'll be sold out in a couple days and we're about a week and a half or so of the super silver three ounce bottles.
[00:45:37.494 --> 00:45:40.196]  Great to have period, really good for your gums, really great for your
[00:45:40.676 --> 00:45:43.319]  We also have the super silver in our whitening toothpaste.
[00:45:43.319 --> 00:45:48.283]  Again, we're the only folks allowed to private label or make our own products with this top nanotech company based here in the U.S.
[00:45:48.283 --> 00:45:51.826]  that's in all these Homeland Security documents and everything, because we get the best stuff.
[00:45:51.826 --> 00:45:52.967]  There's a lot of patriots.
[00:45:52.967 --> 00:45:54.568]  There's not just bad guys coming after us.
[00:45:54.568 --> 00:45:57.571]  There's a flip side of all the good guys and good gals.
[00:45:57.571 --> 00:45:58.311]  It's very exciting.
[00:45:59.312 --> 00:46:05.881]  Keith Bansumer powers the great line of high-quality, storable food we have available at ReadyHour and InfoWareStore.com.
[00:46:05.881 --> 00:46:07.643]  And yes, we're selling storable food here.
[00:46:07.643 --> 00:46:12.169]  What concerns me is, we're a month into this, and food sales aren't going down, they're going up.
[00:46:12.169 --> 00:46:13.932]  You've never seen anything like this.
[00:46:13.932 --> 00:46:14.172]  Never.
[00:46:14.452 --> 00:46:16.373]  Never like this and sustain.
[00:46:16.373 --> 00:46:19.874]  You know, it started, you know, 27 days ago and it kind of went hyper.
[00:46:19.874 --> 00:46:21.575]  And it doesn't fall off.
[00:46:21.575 --> 00:46:25.077]  And in even recent days, you know, it's further increasing.
[00:46:25.077 --> 00:46:26.157]  The semis are rolling.
[00:46:26.157 --> 00:46:26.977]  The chips are in.
[00:46:26.977 --> 00:46:29.458]  We're producing as much as quickly as possible.
[00:46:29.458 --> 00:46:31.819]  Orders that are getting in today, they're going to ship.
[00:46:31.819 --> 00:46:33.740]  They're going to ship in 10 to 14 days.
[00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:35.261]  We're helping people prepare.
[00:46:35.481 --> 00:46:37.381]  It's just something you cover.
[00:46:37.381 --> 00:46:37.781]  Absolutely.
[00:46:37.781 --> 00:46:40.282]  I like to eat daily, and so we're just backing that up.
[00:46:40.282 --> 00:46:41.762]  It's the best insurance out there.
[00:46:41.762 --> 00:46:46.303]  You can get food today that you can eat ten years from now at today's prices.
[00:46:46.303 --> 00:46:49.903]  It's normal to sit on top of horrible food and guns.
[00:46:49.903 --> 00:46:51.004]  All our forebears did it.
[00:46:51.004 --> 00:46:54.824]  We've got food, we've got guns, we've got Jesus, we know how to use it.
[00:46:54.824 --> 00:46:56.185]  We've got a phrase around here, Alex.
[00:46:56.185 --> 00:46:57.165]  It's real simple.
[00:46:57.165 --> 00:47:02.025]  Noah prepared.
[00:47:02.025 --> 00:47:04.666]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:20.148 --> 00:47:24.812]  We are back live on this Wednesday Global Transmission.
[00:47:24.812 --> 00:47:26.714]  CPAC has begun.
[00:47:26.714 --> 00:47:31.318]  We're going to be at the Omni Hotel tonight in D.C., the big one.
[00:47:31.318 --> 00:47:34.241]  That's where I'm sitting right now.
[00:47:34.241 --> 00:47:39.125]  I've sponsored National File with a big, giant event.
[00:47:39.125 --> 00:47:42.068]  Thousand-person ballroom in this really nice hotel.
[00:47:42.068 --> 00:47:44.871]  It's free, brought to you by the listeners of
[00:47:51.271 --> 00:47:52.052]  We're good to go.
[00:48:13.649 --> 00:48:19.033]  He literally just says, please don't talk about my case because they blame me for what you're saying.
[00:48:19.033 --> 00:48:20.253]  That's the only communication.
[00:48:20.253 --> 00:48:21.634]  He says, hey, do you like my suit?
[00:48:21.634 --> 00:48:23.055]  You know, it makes jokes.
[00:48:23.055 --> 00:48:25.557]  He will not talk to me about any of it for months.
[00:48:25.557 --> 00:48:33.382]  And then Bergman Jackson is on the stand saying Stone tells Jones what to do.
[00:48:33.382 --> 00:48:35.363]  And so I'm going to punish Stone for Jones.
[00:48:35.363 --> 00:48:39.886]  And I told Roger, I said, listen, buddy, the Globalist can put a gun to my head.
[00:48:39.886 --> 00:48:41.327]  I'm not shutting up about stuff.
[00:48:41.327 --> 00:48:42.348]  I understand your position.
[00:48:43.211 --> 00:48:46.914]  But this is my country too, and my judiciary.
[00:48:46.914 --> 00:48:48.755]  And this woman is a monster.
[00:48:48.755 --> 00:48:51.217]  And this woman has rigged the jury.
[00:48:51.217 --> 00:48:57.581]  And I understand she's holding you hostage, but I can't negotiate with terrorists.
[00:48:57.581 --> 00:49:00.823]  And Bergman is a terrorist in my view.
[00:49:00.823 --> 00:49:01.444]  A total tyrant.
[00:49:02.026 --> 00:49:04.588]  And the things the Swamp's done, they're too corrupt to fail.
[00:49:04.588 --> 00:49:09.591]  They're too big to fail, they believe, that they committed such crimes that if one goes down, they all go down.
[00:49:09.591 --> 00:49:15.635]  So three musketeers, one for all and all for one, that's how they operate, but in a corruption.
[00:49:15.635 --> 00:49:17.976]  And so let me explain again.
[00:49:17.976 --> 00:49:19.417]  Everyone was in the trial.
[00:49:19.417 --> 00:49:28.222]  There were dozens and hundreds of members of the press in the overflow area as well, hundreds and hundreds, during jury selection three months ago.
[00:49:28.222 --> 00:49:29.183]  And we had reporters there.
[00:49:29.921 --> 00:49:32.962]  And I had him on air, scared to say the names.
[00:49:32.962 --> 00:49:36.224]  But then I got him to give us the names off record, and I put the names up.
[00:49:36.224 --> 00:49:37.905]  I told him, I said, I'm going to put the name out.
[00:49:37.905 --> 00:49:41.766]  And the woman headed up a federal department for Obama!
[00:49:41.766 --> 00:49:45.608]  The judge is appointed by Obama, and her husband works on the Mueller report.
[00:49:45.608 --> 00:49:47.529]  That's ridiculous!
[00:49:47.529 --> 00:49:53.372]  And now we learn about the new foreman, who's a DNC operative with Donna Brazile, who was rigging all the debates for Hillary.
[00:49:53.372 --> 00:49:54.592]  Now a Fox News pundit.
[00:49:54.592 --> 00:49:55.893]  Give me a break.
[00:49:55.893 --> 00:49:56.913]  But here's the big takeaway.
[00:49:56.913 --> 00:49:57.994]  I want Mike Adams' take on this.
[00:49:59.602 --> 00:50:13.893]  Now she's trying to sequester and say for the safety of the jurors because President Trump, these are quotes in the news, because President Trump, Tucker Carlson, and Alex Jones are threatening the jurors.
[00:50:13.893 --> 00:50:15.154]  She won't release their name.
[00:50:15.154 --> 00:50:22.599]  It's not threatening a juror after they've already ruled, after they've already voted with their verdict.
[00:50:22.599 --> 00:50:27.963]  Months later, to say they're Democrat operatives, no wonder you kept them secret.
[00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:32.364]  So they changed the subject from her cover-up and her criminal activity to this.
[00:50:32.364 --> 00:50:34.166]  It is Stalin-esque.
[00:50:34.166 --> 00:50:38.011]  I got to tell you, though, they have just done so many evil things here, Mike.
[00:50:38.011 --> 00:50:40.794]  They think they're too big to fail, but they've just gone too far.
[00:50:40.794 --> 00:50:45.279]  And all over D.C., I'm mobbed by people, mainly black folks, going, we love Roger Stone.
[00:50:45.279 --> 00:50:48.043]  We love you while I'm driving the tank around or on the street.
[00:50:48.043 --> 00:50:48.904]  They really
[00:50:49.544 --> 00:50:54.207]  Well, Amy Berman Jackson, her actions are a parade of tyranny, the exact type of tyranny that our founding fathers
[00:51:10.655 --> 00:51:14.656]  Needed us to get away from, and that's why we fought for our independence.
[00:51:14.656 --> 00:51:18.298]  She needs to be criminally investigated by the DOJ.
[00:51:18.298 --> 00:51:22.919]  Not just removed from her bench, but criminally investigated, in my opinion.
[00:51:22.919 --> 00:51:36.184]  Because what she is doing, abusing, exploiting her power to silence people who are merely trying to discuss the bias of the jury in a twisted, rigged case against Roger Stone.
[00:51:36.184 --> 00:51:39.845]  She needs to be investigated, and if anybody needs to go to jail for seven to nine years,
[00:51:40.445 --> 00:51:43.247]  It's people like her, not Roger Stone.
[00:51:43.247 --> 00:51:45.068]  That's my take, Alex.
[00:51:45.068 --> 00:51:46.089]  I totally agree with you.
[00:51:46.089 --> 00:51:50.531]  I want to play a few clips here that I know we're going to get into.
[00:51:50.531 --> 00:51:52.392]  Corona is the attack on nation states.
[00:51:52.392 --> 00:51:53.973]  It is the attack on Trump.
[00:51:53.973 --> 00:51:54.954]  And it is man-made.
[00:51:54.954 --> 00:51:57.575]  It was transferred by Obama to the Chi-Coms five years ago.
[00:51:57.575 --> 00:51:59.597]  That's Science Magazine.
[00:51:59.597 --> 00:52:00.177]  Five years ago.
[00:52:00.177 --> 00:52:02.699]  It's unbelievably hiding in plain view.
[00:52:02.699 --> 00:52:07.501]  I know that Dr. Boyle is going to have the latest breaking super intel.
[00:52:09.059 --> 00:52:10.340]  World-changing, really.
[00:52:10.340 --> 00:52:11.181]  Cutting-edge.
[00:52:11.181 --> 00:52:12.943]  Next hour with you.
[00:52:12.943 --> 00:52:13.984]  But I wanted just to play this.
[00:52:13.984 --> 00:52:17.467]  This is Napolitano.
[00:52:17.467 --> 00:52:19.229]  I've told you, friends of Trump have been threatened.
[00:52:19.229 --> 00:52:20.069]  They've been attacked.
[00:52:20.069 --> 00:52:21.991]  And not everybody can handle it.
[00:52:21.991 --> 00:52:22.952]  I know the inside baseball.
[00:52:22.952 --> 00:52:24.153]  I'm going to stop there.
[00:52:24.153 --> 00:52:27.977]  But now that the Democrats have been defeated in their impeachment,
[00:52:28.709 --> 00:52:33.013]  Now that that coup failed, Trump is cementing his power as the president right now.
[00:52:33.013 --> 00:52:36.696]  He's still not invincible, far from it, but he's getting stronger every day.
[00:52:36.696 --> 00:52:37.076]  So are we.
[00:52:37.076 --> 00:52:37.817]  They're really scared.
[00:52:37.817 --> 00:52:38.797]  We're all coming together, folks.
[00:52:38.797 --> 00:52:40.199]  We're winning.
[00:52:40.199 --> 00:52:47.825]  And after having his job threatened and blackmail and all the rest of it, Napolitano turned on Trump.
[00:52:47.825 --> 00:52:51.508]  Now, I didn't attack him for that because I've been friends with him.
[00:52:51.508 --> 00:52:52.268]  I just left it at that.
[00:52:52.268 --> 00:52:53.730]  I'll just stop there.
[00:52:53.730 --> 00:52:55.291]  But the truth is the truth.
[00:52:55.291 --> 00:52:57.573]  Now he knows that Trump's winning.
[00:52:58.809 --> 00:53:00.973]  And so he didn't attack Trump with enjoyment.
[00:53:00.973 --> 00:53:03.056]  He had a gun to his head, basically.
[00:53:03.056 --> 00:53:04.478]  Now he comes out and tells the truth.
[00:53:04.478 --> 00:53:06.581]  The old apolitana comes back.
[00:53:06.581 --> 00:53:12.770]  And remember, even some of the disciples, I'm not comparing Trump to Jesus, but there was a
[00:53:14.326 --> 00:53:18.948]  Which one of the disciples was it when the Pharisees had already grabbed Jesus and they're like, are you with him?
[00:53:18.948 --> 00:53:19.428]  Are you with him?
[00:53:19.428 --> 00:53:20.529]  And he said, I'm not with him.
[00:53:20.529 --> 00:53:21.349]  I'm not with him.
[00:53:21.349 --> 00:53:23.210]  That guy, you know, went on to be a great guy.
[00:53:23.210 --> 00:53:25.491]  People get scared is my point.
[00:53:25.491 --> 00:53:27.872]  And they, I mean, I've never done this.
[00:53:27.872 --> 00:53:28.632]  I'm not trying to brag.
[00:53:28.632 --> 00:53:30.073]  I'm just telling you, I'm the opposite.
[00:53:30.073 --> 00:53:31.554]  I get threatened.
[00:53:31.554 --> 00:53:33.535]  But not everybody's a Tasmanian devil.
[00:53:33.535 --> 00:53:41.838]  And so the fact that Napolitano has now come back to the Trumpian side is another bellwether of our giant, our giant victory.
[00:53:41.838 --> 00:53:43.119]  So here's what Napolitano had to say.
[00:53:44.016 --> 00:53:50.022]  No one should be happy about secrecy, whether you like Stone or dislike him, whether you like the President or dislike him.
[00:53:50.022 --> 00:53:56.288]  This is a hearing to determine whether or not there was jury impropriety in the trial.
[00:53:56.288 --> 00:54:05.778]  Whether a juror failed to disclose her preconceived prejudice against President Trump and against Roger Stone.
[00:54:06.278 --> 00:54:07.639]  Why it is secret?
[00:54:07.639 --> 00:54:08.960]  We're not being given a reason.
[00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:11.001]  But the secrecy is compounded.
[00:54:11.001 --> 00:54:15.363]  It's one thing to have a secret hearing and then let the participants go out and speak to the press.
[00:54:15.363 --> 00:54:21.207]  It's another thing to have a secret hearing and to bar the participants from speaking to the press.
[00:54:21.207 --> 00:54:22.867]  That's what this judge has done.
[00:54:22.867 --> 00:54:25.189]  This is absolutely Stalinistic.
[00:54:25.729 --> 00:54:38.438]  Now, when this argument that I had been making in summary fashion was made by Stone's lawyers in writing two days ago, she said, okay, I will hear you at 1.30 and you can tell me why it should not be secret.
[00:54:38.438 --> 00:54:43.821]  And then at 2 o'clock, I'll lock the courtroom door and make it secret unless you change my mind.
[00:54:43.821 --> 00:54:45.443]  That's what we're confronting.
[00:54:45.443 --> 00:54:46.783]  That's based on a sentence.
[00:54:46.783 --> 00:54:48.325]  She has gagged Stone.
[00:54:49.272 --> 00:54:57.485]  It is one thing to gag the defendant during a trial because you don't want him going out talking to the press and it's a way to communicate with the jury.
[00:54:57.485 --> 00:54:58.547]  There is no jury.
[00:54:58.547 --> 00:54:59.609]  There is no trial.
[00:54:59.609 --> 00:55:00.730]  He's been convicted.
[00:55:00.730 --> 00:55:01.472]  He's been sentenced.
[00:55:02.830 --> 00:55:10.253]  The gag serves no legitimate governmental purpose and yet she's enforcing it on him and on his lawyers.
[00:55:10.253 --> 00:55:20.138]  Question, why is the Bill Barr Department of Justice not opposing this secrecy and not opposing this gag rule?
[00:55:20.138 --> 00:55:26.441]  Now notice the old Napolitano was riveting and happy and smart and being himself on having to lie.
[00:55:27.122 --> 00:55:30.568]  I'm having a twist, but then the one that was attacking Trump would like to end.
[00:55:30.568 --> 00:55:34.675]  Then Trump might have done something bad here because he had a gun to his head.
[00:55:35.686 --> 00:55:37.887]  So I just point out that that's the worm turning.
[00:55:37.887 --> 00:55:40.229]  That's the whole system realizing they're losing.
[00:55:40.229 --> 00:55:42.150]  But they're going to do even more desperate things now.
[00:55:42.150 --> 00:55:44.011]  They're going to double down on even bigger crimes.
[00:55:44.011 --> 00:55:53.357]  But what Jackson has been caught doing and how she's trying to cover up the rest of the jury pool, that's where everything is at, is the other jurors.
[00:55:53.357 --> 00:55:54.798]  Wait until we find out who else they are.
[00:55:54.798 --> 00:55:56.779]  Well, I've already been told about folks that were there.
[00:55:56.779 --> 00:55:57.279]  It's bad.
[00:55:57.279 --> 00:56:01.242]  They're basically, almost all of them, were Democratic Party operatives.
[00:56:02.202 --> 00:56:09.786]  One old lady said, I'm not going along with this the day before the trial ended, and she fell down on her head and a special juror was put in her place.
[00:56:09.786 --> 00:56:13.248]  This is globalist gangster activity, Mike Adams.
[00:56:13.248 --> 00:56:17.951]  It is gang-style warfare at the highest levels in the United States of America.
[00:56:17.951 --> 00:56:23.454]  But as we, the independent media, continue to expose the names and the backgrounds and the biases of these jurors,
[00:56:23.894 --> 00:56:25.416]  The truth is going to come out.
[00:56:25.416 --> 00:56:29.519]  The investigations must be commenced against these individuals.
[00:56:29.519 --> 00:56:43.232]  If we are to have any remaining public faith in our system of justice, in the Department of Justice, even in the Trump oversight or presidency itself, we have to have these potential criminals investigated.
[00:56:43.232 --> 00:56:44.454]  Otherwise... Am I... Yes.
[00:56:45.339 --> 00:56:46.900]  Mike, that's the key, the part I forgot.
[00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:49.102]  I'm glad you brought that up, as you always do.
[00:56:49.102 --> 00:56:56.507]  This is the exact type of abuses the Declaration of Independence talks about heavily in judiciary systems that become kangaroo show trials.
[00:56:56.507 --> 00:57:04.553]  But then, we have to understand, they were beta testing this, they admit, for judicial tyranny across the country.
[00:57:04.553 --> 00:57:06.394]  I've been under the very same systems.
[00:57:06.394 --> 00:57:12.319]  And so they pick these select judges, they're Democrat operatives, then you're put into their courtrooms and they literally lynch you.
[00:57:13.317 --> 00:57:14.638]  Thank you for having me.
[00:57:48.419 --> 00:57:53.963]  I don't sell firearms, but I promote them constantly.
[00:57:53.963 --> 00:57:57.386]  Now, could somebody listen to me and go out and buy a gun and use it wrong?
[00:57:57.386 --> 00:57:57.946]  Yeah.
[00:57:57.946 --> 00:57:59.648]  Just like I'm telling people, hey, I'm a man.
[00:57:59.648 --> 00:58:00.508]  I love women.
[00:58:00.508 --> 00:58:02.130]  You ought to go out and get a girlfriend.
[00:58:02.130 --> 00:58:03.511]  You may have problems with her.
[00:58:03.511 --> 00:58:04.772]  You may get a divorce.
[00:58:04.772 --> 00:58:05.392]  You may whatever.
[00:58:05.392 --> 00:58:10.136]  The point is, I'm just steering you in the direction I went that was successful and I loved.
[00:58:10.416 --> 00:58:24.331]  Well, when it comes to supplements and when it comes to storable foods, we've got the best out there because I want you to get a great result and to come back again and again as a customer and fund our political, spiritual operations against globalism.
[00:58:24.331 --> 00:58:29.216]  So if you want storable foods and everybody else is sold out, and you want them delivered to your door, you want to be high quality,
[00:58:29.736 --> 00:58:33.360]  Take action now at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:37.264]  I've got to tell you, the next week or two I may come out and say, sorry, no more food sales.

[01:00:09.255 --> 01:00:14.376]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live broadcasting worldwide from Washington, D.C.
[01:00:14.376 --> 01:00:15.676]  and CPAC.
[01:00:15.676 --> 01:00:18.157]  Again, I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:00:18.157 --> 01:00:25.318]  Mike Adams is about to be taking over on the other side of this break with Dr. Francis Boyle, the author of the U.S.
[01:00:25.318 --> 01:00:29.759]  Biological Weapons Treaty that then became world law.
[01:00:29.759 --> 01:00:37.240]  He broke that it was man-made, confirming the Indian universities and institutes and others, and our research, Mike Adams' research,
[01:00:38.104 --> 01:00:46.549]  And he also broke the fact that it was transferred by Obama five years ago from North Carolina University to the shy comms.
[01:00:46.549 --> 01:00:48.190]  Did the shy comms release it on purpose?
[01:00:48.190 --> 01:00:49.491]  Did it get out of the lab?
[01:00:49.491 --> 01:00:52.693]  Now we see it being used against the world economy, against Trump.
[01:00:52.693 --> 01:00:55.435]  I believe this has been intentional.
[01:00:55.435 --> 01:01:01.218]  And we can all have our opinion on that, but the bombshell is that it is man-made.
[01:01:01.218 --> 01:01:03.660]  It does have a high kill rate in areas of the
[01:01:07.344 --> 01:01:07.704]  We're good.
[01:01:22.602 --> 01:01:22.862]  Yes, sir.
[01:01:47.023 --> 01:01:52.451]  We didn't want to have a sponsor that just sells the government every time there's a crisis so that you get your food from the government.
[01:01:52.451 --> 01:01:54.415]  We wanted to have it directly to the people.
[01:01:54.415 --> 01:01:56.137]  My Patriots been around 12 years.
[01:01:56.137 --> 01:01:56.698]  We've been with them
[01:01:59.735 --> 01:02:00.235]  Thank you, Mike.
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:22.922]  Most of them are customers that never bought from us before.
[01:02:22.922 --> 01:02:26.245]  And that's the general public realizing that they need swearable foods.
[01:02:26.245 --> 01:02:29.547]  That's the general public realizing that there's a real crisis going on.
[01:02:29.547 --> 01:02:34.631]  And now the federal government's saying, get swearable food, get prepared to shelter in place for at least a month.
[01:02:34.631 --> 01:02:36.953]  What do they know that we don't know?
[01:02:36.953 --> 01:02:38.714]  Hopefully they're just overreacting.
[01:02:38.714 --> 01:02:41.056]  Hopefully it's just hype, but it doesn't matter.
[01:02:41.056 --> 01:02:42.437]  This is insurance.
[01:02:42.437 --> 01:02:44.718]  You can eat and it funds the info war.
[01:02:44.718 --> 01:02:49.322]  And you see us here driving around the federal building, federal courthouse, bullhorning that corrupt,
[01:02:50.154 --> 01:02:52.998]  Globalist judge that got caught rigging the Stone Jury.
[01:02:52.998 --> 01:02:57.826]  You see us putting on a big event, sponsoring an event here at the AMI tonight.
[01:02:57.826 --> 01:03:03.835]  Free to the public, an emergency summit on the First Amendment and how to save free expression, an emergency message to President Trump.
[01:03:03.835 --> 01:03:05.698]  I'm going to be bullhorning at the White House again.
[01:03:06.767 --> 01:03:12.251]  It's all about leadership, and the only way we can engage in leadership is your funding of this show.
[01:03:12.251 --> 01:03:26.040]  And you do that by buying the high-quality, affordable food that you and your family already need at infowarrestore.com today and locking it in, because next week, some of the food prices on some of the number 10 cans are going to have to go up, maybe even others, because it's just going up exponentially.
[01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:30.463]  Get your orders in now at infowarrestore.com or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[01:03:30.463 --> 01:03:32.564]  But as of this Wednesday, live show, it is four weeks for delivery,
[01:03:36.927 --> 01:03:39.108]  They have the food on hand, but they've got to package it.
[01:03:39.108 --> 01:03:42.210]  They've got now four factories going 24 hours a day.
[01:03:42.210 --> 01:03:43.931]  They're trying to get a fifth factory.
[01:03:43.931 --> 01:03:47.613]  They're taking all their money and putting it forward to buy even more food into the future.
[01:03:47.613 --> 01:03:49.494]  I told them a month ago, I said, just keep buying.
[01:03:49.494 --> 01:03:50.554]  My gut says this is big.
[01:03:50.554 --> 01:03:52.655]  It's not a gamble for you to spend all your reserves.
[01:03:52.655 --> 01:03:54.056]  You know, just keep buying.
[01:03:54.056 --> 01:03:54.917]  And they did.
[01:03:54.917 --> 01:03:56.037]  So they have food.
[01:03:56.037 --> 01:04:01.400]  Others sell out, hold the money because they're not in this business for the reasons we are.
[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:04.982]  We're in this to promote freedom and to be prepared and to be self-sufficient.
[01:04:05.632 --> 01:04:06.933]  InfoWarsTore.com.

[01:04:23.102 --> 01:04:29.926]  Now, Mike Adams is taking over right now to cover the waterfront on the virus and what it's really intended to do.
[01:04:29.926 --> 01:04:31.607]  Mike Adams, you're going to break in 30 seconds.
[01:04:31.607 --> 01:04:32.107]  Please take over.
[01:04:32.782 --> 01:04:49.336]  All right, we've got Professor Francis Boyle coming up with a lot of intriguing new questions I have ready for Francis Boyle, and he has been at the forefront of the truth, speaking out courageously about the death science industry around the world that builds biological weapons against humanity.
[01:04:49.336 --> 01:04:49.937]  That's coming up.
[01:04:49.937 --> 01:04:52.058]  Stay with us right after this one-minute break.
[01:04:52.058 --> 01:04:52.459]  We'll be back.
[01:04:57.179 --> 01:04:59.902]  There can no longer be any doubt.
[01:04:59.902 --> 01:05:03.886]  This coronavirus is serious on multiple levels.
[01:05:03.886 --> 01:05:05.207]  It's very communicable.
[01:05:05.207 --> 01:05:07.209]  It spreads very, very fast.
[01:05:07.209 --> 01:05:09.191]  It is killing a lot of people.
[01:05:09.191 --> 01:05:12.915]  And the Chinese Communist government has covered up just how bad it is.
[01:05:12.915 --> 01:05:15.858]  And the White House is now openly challenging them.
[01:05:15.858 --> 01:05:18.941]  So are Trump's top scientists, and so is Senator Cotton.
[01:05:19.742 --> 01:05:24.364]  My friends, now is the time to get prepared.
[01:05:24.364 --> 01:05:26.724]  2020 is not a year to play games with.
[01:05:26.724 --> 01:05:30.466]  The globalists are trying to create economic collapse, race riots.
[01:05:30.466 --> 01:05:33.347]  We don't know how bad this virus is going to get here.
[01:05:33.347 --> 01:05:36.908]  That's why listeners to InfoWars need to be prepared.
[01:05:36.908 --> 01:05:40.349]  InfoWarsStore.com has the products that make
[01:05:40.849 --> 01:05:46.572]  We have the last of the immune gargle selling out as we speak.
[01:05:46.572 --> 01:05:49.513]  We have high-quality, storable foods ready to ship.
[01:05:49.513 --> 01:05:59.498]  And Vitamin Mineral Fusion is back in stock along with Ultra 12 at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:05:59.498 --> 01:06:07.362]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones with Mike Adams.
[01:06:10.581 --> 01:06:12.682]  All right, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:12.682 --> 01:06:24.787]  Mike Adams here, the Health Ranger, and I'm joined in this segment, the next couple of segments, in fact, by Professor Francis Boyle, who has been one of the most courageous and accurate outspoken voices.
[01:06:24.787 --> 01:06:35.932]  You could call him a whistleblower on this issue of the bioengineering origins of the current COVID-19 coronavirus that is circulating and spreading worldwide.
[01:06:36.432 --> 01:06:40.234]  Professor Boyle joins us by Skype with some new questions.
[01:06:40.234 --> 01:06:44.075]  I've got a lot of new questions for you today, but welcome to the show, Professor Boyle.
[01:06:44.075 --> 01:06:46.116]  It's great to have you on.
[01:06:46.116 --> 01:06:56.040]  Well, thank you for having me on, Mike, and my best year viewing audience, and keep up the good work with your newsletter.
[01:06:56.040 --> 01:07:04.123]  I can't guarantee I can answer all your questions, Mike, because this is an evolving situation.
[01:07:05.078 --> 01:07:09.204]  And I try to evaluate the evidence as it comes in.
[01:07:09.204 --> 01:07:16.573]  So you're free to answer your questions, but if I don't have the answers, please accept my apologies.
[01:07:16.573 --> 01:07:18.275]  Well, this is what we appreciate about you.
[01:07:18.275 --> 01:07:18.335]  You
[01:07:19.677 --> 01:07:23.781]  Often talk about you're working with the best information available at the moment.
[01:07:23.781 --> 01:07:27.485]  You adjust your answers as new information comes in.
[01:07:27.485 --> 01:07:33.691]  It's a very scientific approach to being cautious but as accurate as you can given the current data set.
[01:07:33.691 --> 01:07:39.136]  So let's begin with a question going back to some of your previous interviews with Owen Schroyer and Alex Jones.
[01:07:40.177 --> 01:08:04.914]  Is it accurate to state that because the imprint of the origins of the virus is really part of the RNA code of the virus, isn't it true, or let's have your take on it, that basically any virologist who has the proper library of patterns of RNA could independently confirm that yes, this had to have been engineered because here's the evidence of it?
[01:08:04.914 --> 01:08:05.935]  Is that an accurate statement?
[01:08:07.662 --> 01:08:24.959]  Yes, as a matter of fact, when I was on with Alex, I cited that study by the French and Canadian virologists saying, yes indeed, it was gain-of-function work.
[01:08:24.959 --> 01:08:33.187]  And two Chinese that I cited last week, two Chinese scientists
[01:08:34.528 --> 01:08:39.252]  Came out and said the same thing, and we would call that an admission against interest.
[01:08:39.252 --> 01:08:48.218]  We lawyers, we actually have Chinese scientists coming out and saying, yes, it came out of that Wuhan BSL-4 lab.
[01:08:48.218 --> 01:08:55.403]  Now, I've read recently they were forced to withdraw that study, but you can see it there.
[01:08:55.403 --> 01:08:57.545]  So, sure, and I think
[01:08:58.868 --> 01:09:00.609]  You know, if I can figure it out.
[01:09:00.609 --> 01:09:08.192]  I don't have a PhD from MIT, but if I can figure it out, I think most people can figure it out.
[01:09:08.192 --> 01:09:12.794]  Sure, certainly virologists, microbiologists can, yes.
[01:09:12.794 --> 01:09:19.436]  So it's interesting that you just mentioned the political pressure in China for those scientists to withdraw their paper.
[01:09:19.436 --> 01:09:21.557]  We've seen that before, not the first time with this.
[01:09:22.057 --> 01:09:25.778]  Here's a question to you, and if you're not comfortable answering this, that's perfectly okay.
[01:09:25.778 --> 01:09:32.341]  You can pass on it, but are you being pressured to stop doing these interviews, for example, or to stop talking about this?
[01:09:32.341 --> 01:09:35.342]  I know you've been blacklisted from the media for many, many years.
[01:09:35.342 --> 01:09:36.662]  You mentioned that before.
[01:09:36.662 --> 01:09:44.185]  Are you receiving new pressure now for talking about the bioengineering origins of this virus?
[01:09:44.185 --> 01:09:46.766]  Well, let me put it this way.
[01:09:46.766 --> 01:09:47.286]  As I said,
[01:09:48.591 --> 01:09:57.778]  The last time I was interviewed, I did blow the whistle on Amerithrax coming out of a U.S.
[01:09:57.778 --> 01:10:04.442]  biological warfare weapons program the first week in the weekend of November 2001.
[01:10:06.868 --> 01:10:08.609]  I said that to Fox News.
[01:10:08.609 --> 01:10:11.449]  I said that to a Washington, D.C.
[01:10:11.449 --> 01:10:12.850]  radio station.
[01:10:12.850 --> 01:10:17.311]  And then I said it to the BBC.
[01:10:17.311 --> 01:10:19.671]  So the whole world heard me then.
[01:10:19.671 --> 01:10:20.852]  And then I was cut off.
[01:10:20.852 --> 01:10:22.652]  The hammer came down.
[01:10:22.652 --> 01:10:25.193]  And no other mainstream news media source
[01:10:26.451 --> 01:10:31.392]  Certainly here in the United States, Europe, Latin America, Asia has interviewed me.
[01:10:31.392 --> 01:10:47.677]  So certainly I have been blackballed and blacklisted since then, despite the fact that I wrote the statute that deals precisely with this issue and criminalizes it and expressly dealing with
[01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:54.703]  The use of DNA and genetic engineering to create biological weapons.
[01:10:54.703 --> 01:11:12.291]  As for pressure, so far the only pressure I've gotten was some public relations firm up in Chicago who was paid, I guess, to silence me by filing complaints with the law school
[01:11:13.255 --> 01:11:13.636]  All right.
[01:11:32.674 --> 01:11:33.154]  Of course.
[01:11:52.014 --> 01:11:56.758]  You'll see my name is all over everywhere, over the entire world.
[01:11:56.758 --> 01:12:00.441]  Not that I want the publicity, but I don't really need it.
[01:12:00.441 --> 01:12:07.947]  Well, you're not really a frontline whistleblower until you've had a PR company hired to spread lies and defame you.
[01:12:07.947 --> 01:12:13.792]  So you are in good company because, of course, I've had the same thing happen to me, same things happen to Alex and so on.
[01:12:13.792 --> 01:12:19.677]  So yeah, there's a coordinated, well-funded campaign to try to smear all the voices that are telling the truth about this.
[01:12:20.997 --> 01:12:36.262]  Well, they were trying to intimidate me into silence by filing this complaint with my employers, what they were doing, and I'm not easily intimidated, what can I say?
[01:12:37.253 --> 01:12:40.758]  Well, that's what we love about you because you follow the science.
[01:12:40.758 --> 01:12:46.044]  You have the courage to state the obvious when it's not politically correct.
[01:12:46.044 --> 01:12:49.869]  And I don't know your politics in general, and that's not even relevant here.
[01:12:49.869 --> 01:12:52.913]  I honor you for your courage on this issue.
[01:12:52.913 --> 01:12:53.614]  Next question.
[01:12:54.435 --> 01:12:57.498]  I do want to say I am a political independent.
[01:12:57.498 --> 01:13:08.407]  When I decided to do this work shortly after turning 17 years old, I concluded the only way I could do it was remain a political independent.
[01:13:08.407 --> 01:13:10.809]  And so that's how I appear here.
[01:13:10.809 --> 01:13:15.052]  And I'm not trying to match President Trump or anything like that.
[01:13:15.052 --> 01:13:20.297]  I'm trying to look at this objectively and analytically.
[01:13:21.538 --> 01:13:25.540]  from my background in training and tell the truth as I see it.
[01:13:25.540 --> 01:13:27.921]  Of course, I could be wrong.
[01:13:27.921 --> 01:13:36.807]  New information could come out at any time that would force me to reevaluate my position and I get in here.
[01:13:36.807 --> 01:13:46.473]  I get up early in the morning, go through the computer, I see your newsletter and a lot of other sources and for the last week I get my secretary to run them off.
[01:13:47.199 --> 01:13:51.525]  I come in here first thing in the morning in my office, and I read through them all.
[01:13:51.525 --> 01:13:59.916]  And then I continue on with my ongoing evaluation, because it's such a fluid situation, Mike, as you know.
[01:14:00.638 --> 01:14:02.619]  Yes, well, and by the way, I apologize.
[01:14:02.619 --> 01:14:08.241]  I misspelled your first name in the first round of the transcript that we did, but I now know how to spell your name correctly.
[01:14:08.241 --> 01:14:09.721]  I apologize.
[01:14:09.721 --> 01:14:19.685]  Next question is, how easy is it for rogue nations to harvest this virus now that it is really open source?
[01:14:19.685 --> 01:14:21.106]  It's in the public domain.
[01:14:21.106 --> 01:14:27.368]  If Iran or North Korea or anyone wanted to harvest this virus and then incubate it and grow it themselves, how easy would that be?
[01:14:29.867 --> 01:14:32.329]  Well, it's out there.
[01:14:32.329 --> 01:14:42.697]  I think we have to understand that the original people who grew it were the University of North Carolina.
[01:14:42.697 --> 01:14:48.722]  I established that already in my last interview.
[01:14:48.722 --> 01:14:55.928]  I went through the entire scientific article, which Alex put up there, and
[01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:01.261]  Due to limitations of time, we only had an hour.
[01:15:01.261 --> 01:15:04.283]  I could only spend about 10 minutes going through this article.
[01:15:04.283 --> 01:15:04.863]  Yes.
[01:15:04.863 --> 01:15:20.969]  All the evil behind this article of what they were doing and what they knew they were doing, and that they took this dirty money from China to allow one of the leading death scientists from China
[01:15:21.730 --> 01:15:32.977]  To be involved in this extremely dangerous, existentially dangerous research and undoubtedly... Professor Boyle, I'm sorry to interrupt you.
[01:15:32.977 --> 01:15:33.817]  Hold that thought.
[01:15:33.817 --> 01:15:35.078]  We've got to go to a break here.
[01:15:35.078 --> 01:15:47.025]  We're going to come back with more details from Francis Boyle about the bioengineering origins of this virus and what it means for humanity and the death industry of death science that's behind this.
[01:15:47.025 --> 01:15:48.186]  You're watching the Alex Jones Show.
[01:15:48.186 --> 01:15:48.946]  This is Mike Adams.
[01:15:48.946 --> 01:15:49.507]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:56.243 --> 01:15:58.184]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:15:58.184 --> 01:16:03.505]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:16:03.505 --> 01:16:05.085]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:16:05.085 --> 01:16:13.427]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:16:13.427 --> 01:16:19.129]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:16:19.309 --> 01:16:21.130]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:16:21.130 --> 01:16:23.412]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:16:23.412 --> 01:16:27.794]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:16:27.794 --> 01:16:29.996]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:16:29.996 --> 01:16:37.841]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[01:17:06.315 --> 01:17:14.038]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[01:17:14.038 --> 01:17:21.922]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[01:17:22.082 --> 01:17:23.883]  Not a security IPO or note.
[01:17:23.883 --> 01:17:33.405]  Blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each month.
[01:17:33.405 --> 01:17:34.246]  Don't miss this one.

[01:17:37.827 --> 01:17:38.547]  Equipment offer poses a
[01:17:49.650 --> 01:17:52.152]  A lot of people ask me the InfoWars secret, and I'll just tell you, I'm just real.
[01:18:03.584 --> 01:18:08.508]  Now, the problem is, I go back and forth, though, in my mind about where I stand.
[01:18:08.508 --> 01:18:12.111]  I mean, on basic stuff, like the Second Amendment, and family, and God, I'm 100%.
[01:18:12.111 --> 01:18:16.234]  But if you get to other issues, I start asking myself questions.
[01:18:16.234 --> 01:18:22.079]  So I'll just tell you, I feel really guilty during the middle of this crisis selling high-quality, storable food.
[01:18:22.079 --> 01:18:30.646]  Even though I was pre-positioned, I'm right, we were right about being man-made, we're right about it being super deadly, we're right about being prepared, it still feels weird to be right.
[01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:32.701]  Isn't that crazy?
[01:18:32.701 --> 01:18:33.481]  But you know what?
[01:18:33.481 --> 01:18:34.862]  I'm getting past that.
[01:18:34.862 --> 01:18:36.483]  We still have storable food.
[01:18:36.483 --> 01:18:37.363]  We have plenty of it.
[01:18:37.363 --> 01:18:39.885]  The problem is the packaging of it and getting it out.
[01:18:39.885 --> 01:18:41.285]  Other competitors don't have it.
[01:18:41.285 --> 01:18:42.046]  They're lying to you.
[01:18:42.046 --> 01:18:47.289]  Get your orders at infowarsstore.com and you know you're going to get high quality storable food.
[01:18:47.289 --> 01:18:48.930]  But now it's not two weeks.
[01:18:48.930 --> 01:18:49.950]  It's four weeks, folks.
[01:18:49.950 --> 01:18:50.651]  We got the food.
[01:18:50.651 --> 01:18:51.831]  We got to package it.
[01:18:51.831 --> 01:18:55.753]  Get your food today, high quality, and fund the Infowar at infowarsstore.com.
[01:18:57.114 --> 01:19:08.824]  Across the Western world, from high school to college sports, to even the Olympics, men, biological men, are winning almost all of the sporting events.
[01:19:08.824 --> 01:19:12.668]  This is men invading women's spaces and bullying them.
[01:19:13.148 --> 01:19:15.229]  And taking their rights away.
[01:19:15.229 --> 01:19:17.810]  All in the name of liberalism and openness.
[01:19:17.810 --> 01:19:21.672]  And then every day I have stacks of news articles just like today.
[01:19:21.672 --> 01:19:28.395]  UK teen fined under house arrest for asking trans police officers gender and it hurt their feelings.
[01:19:28.395 --> 01:19:28.936]  UK mother.
[01:19:29.796 --> 01:19:40.221]  Spare jail for misgendering trans woman ordered to pay thousand pound fine because it could have caused anxiety in the new royalty.
[01:19:40.221 --> 01:19:41.922]  That's the thought police.
[01:19:41.922 --> 01:19:47.064]  If a leftist has their feelings hurt for any reason, you get fined and you go to jail.
[01:19:47.064 --> 01:19:48.344]  This is tyranny.
[01:19:48.344 --> 01:19:54.627]  These people are bullies and it's sick and it's evil and it's part of a scientific anti-human takeover.
[01:19:54.627 --> 01:19:55.247]  Resist it.
[01:19:55.247 --> 01:19:56.048]  Speak out against it.
[01:19:59.406 --> 01:20:10.958]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:10.958 --> 01:20:18.005]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Mike Adams.
[01:20:18.005 --> 01:20:20.807]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:24.982]  And we're back on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:24.982 --> 01:20:29.748]  Mike Adams here interviewing Professor Francis Boyle about the origins of the coronavirus.
[01:20:29.748 --> 01:20:40.540]  We're also going to ask him here about biological weapons response protocols that may be likely by nations if this is ever deployed in an aggressive weapon format.
[01:20:41.021 --> 01:20:41.601]  I don't think so.
[01:21:00.530 --> 01:21:02.471]  You're in a lot of trouble.
[01:21:02.471 --> 01:21:03.451]  So get prepared.
[01:21:03.451 --> 01:21:04.331]  It's a smart thing to do.
[01:21:04.331 --> 01:21:07.312]  It's like buying insurance for your life.
[01:21:07.312 --> 01:21:09.893]  And it's much better than having nothing to eat.
[01:21:09.893 --> 01:21:12.654]  So definitely infowarestore.com.
[01:21:12.654 --> 01:21:15.015]  Continuing with Professor Francis Boyle.
[01:21:15.015 --> 01:21:23.938]  So my opening question here is, as I just hinted there, Professor, is there a protocol in place for the United States, for example, if the U.S.
[01:21:23.938 --> 01:21:23.998]  is
[01:21:24.898 --> 01:21:30.240]  Confirming that we are being, let's say, attacked with a biological weapon.
[01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:33.482]  What protocols might be in place to respond to that?
[01:21:33.482 --> 01:21:35.803]  Because how do you not escalate that?
[01:21:35.803 --> 01:21:38.784]  Or what are other countries doing in terms of their escalation policies?
[01:21:38.784 --> 01:21:42.366]  Do you have some background on that?
[01:21:42.366 --> 01:21:44.387]  Well, Mike, we attacked ourselves.
[01:21:44.387 --> 01:21:46.528]  We have to understand that.
[01:21:46.528 --> 01:21:48.008]  Again, excuse me.
[01:21:48.008 --> 01:21:50.689]  Yes, so go ahead.
[01:21:50.689 --> 01:21:54.231]  We're talking about escalation protocols, biological weapons responses.
[01:21:55.211 --> 01:22:17.689]  As far as I can tell, Mike, we attacked ourselves with that University of North Carolina gain-of-function DNA genetically engineered research that basically China paid to get access to and took back and has now leaked out of that BSL-4 facility.
[01:22:17.689 --> 01:22:20.671]  As for protocols, well,
[01:22:21.877 --> 01:22:35.864]  Mike, the problem is, if you look at the response by the United States government so far, I'm not personally blaming President Trump, but I am blaming all of his scientific advisors.
[01:22:35.864 --> 01:22:42.267]  You'll see mass confusion, disinformation, and lies.
[01:22:42.267 --> 01:22:47.550]  And that is because all of President Trump's top scientific advisors
[01:22:48.428 --> 01:22:55.474]  Have been up to their eyeballs in this Nazi biological warfare work for forever.
[01:22:55.474 --> 01:22:59.818]  Tony Fauci, who's out there, he knows all about it.
[01:22:59.818 --> 01:23:02.740]  And what does he say in today's New York Times?
[01:23:02.740 --> 01:23:05.042]  Well, just continue on the way we're going.
[01:23:05.042 --> 01:23:06.544]  We're doing a great job.
[01:23:06.544 --> 01:23:07.865]  Right.
[01:23:07.865 --> 01:23:09.086]  Woman, Les Marnier.
[01:23:09.790 --> 01:23:17.454]  Well, she says, well, we got to get ready, but she's not going to come clean with us.
[01:23:17.454 --> 01:23:27.320]  Azar, the Secretary of Health, he worked for the pharmaceutical companies, and he was a lobbyist for the pharmaceutical countries.
[01:23:27.320 --> 01:23:31.002]  They planned to make a killing off of this.
[01:23:31.002 --> 01:23:32.863]  And so he's in cahoots
[01:23:33.473 --> 01:23:43.056]  In cahoots with them, CDC has been up to their eyeballs in biological warfare work since at least the Reagan administration.
[01:23:43.056 --> 01:23:52.158]  So how can any of these people coordinate a proper response to the healthcare crisis here
[01:23:52.896 --> 01:23:55.278]  That affects us in America today.
[01:23:55.278 --> 01:23:55.979]  They can't.
[01:23:55.979 --> 01:24:07.608]  And that's why even your own newsletter put out basically a silencing of reporting here by the CDC.
[01:24:07.608 --> 01:24:08.749]  I think that's correct.
[01:24:08.749 --> 01:24:10.971]  They're saying, well, there's only 57 cases.
[01:24:10.971 --> 01:24:12.372]  Don't worry about it.
[01:24:12.372 --> 01:24:16.915]  Well, we see this Harvard professor estimate 200 to 400.
[01:24:16.915 --> 01:24:18.637]  It's far worse, I think,
[01:24:19.326 --> 01:24:21.308]  Than anything they are telling it.
[01:24:21.308 --> 01:24:24.250]  And then Larry Kudlow saying, well, we have it all under control.
[01:24:24.250 --> 01:24:25.671]  Don't worry about it.
[01:24:25.671 --> 01:24:26.992]  This is progress.
[01:24:26.992 --> 01:24:35.798]  So how, Mike, how can we deal with the current situation here in America?
[01:24:35.798 --> 01:24:39.020]  Let's put aside the rest of the world.
[01:24:39.020 --> 01:24:45.225]  If the people advising the president are guilty themselves.
[01:24:45.225 --> 01:24:46.326]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:24:46.326 --> 01:24:47.787]  How can that possibly be done?
[01:24:48.215 --> 01:24:49.436]  I've got huge concerns.
[01:25:06.365 --> 01:25:30.660]  People get infected and start dying and then they get a windfall of profits by creating the vaccines and then they get to be positioned as the saviors of humanity because now lives are being saved by the mandatory vaccine which is being fast-tracked with probably no clinical trials and Congress is going to pass a law to say that the vaccine companies have legal immunity from side effects and so on and so forth.
[01:25:30.660 --> 01:25:33.542]  I get all that and that's kind of what you're describing is what it sounds like.
[01:25:34.284 --> 01:25:40.865]  Mike, these vaccines will be more dangerous than worthless between you and me.
[01:25:40.865 --> 01:25:49.307]  Indeed, that's what happened was behind the Ebola pandemic there in West Africa.
[01:25:49.307 --> 01:26:03.469]  It was a biowarfare Ebola vaccine that was being given out at that BSL-4 facility at Kenema that was being run by Fort Detrick
[01:26:04.629 --> 01:26:17.112]  And USAID, which is really a front organization for the CIA, and the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT.
[01:26:17.112 --> 01:26:26.854]  And they gave these Black West Africans this Ebola vaccine, alleged vaccine, that was giving them live Ebola in there.
[01:26:26.854 --> 01:26:32.015]  And there was also, I can't remember if it was GlaxoSmithKline that was involved in that too,
[01:26:32.811 --> 01:26:37.637]  And they eventually admitted, yeah, the vaccine was more dangerous than worthless, but they're in there.
[01:26:37.637 --> 01:26:46.367]  So sure, all the drug companies that Azar represented, and I suspect still is in cahoots with,
[01:26:46.992 --> 01:26:50.753]  They're out there chomping at the bit and getting ready.
[01:26:50.753 --> 01:27:06.998]  If you read yesterday's Wall Street Journal, they just had a big article on this and, you know, everyone's trying to rush into proof these bogus vaccines that I suspect are only going to make this situation work.
[01:27:06.998 --> 01:27:09.438]  Certainly, I wouldn't take one of them.
[01:27:09.438 --> 01:27:11.679]  I guess what other people do is up to them.
[01:27:12.159 --> 01:27:25.408]  They rushed the diagnostic test kits the CDC did, and those test kits had bad reagents, and it turned out that those kits had false positives and false negatives, so of course they're completely unreliable from a scientific point of view.
[01:27:25.408 --> 01:27:30.051]  If you don't know whether your results are false positive or false negative, it's pointless.
[01:27:30.051 --> 01:27:39.297]  So now the CDC says they're going to replace those, but doesn't this also then underscore the fact that everything is being so rushed that quality control steps are being skipped
[01:27:39.637 --> 01:27:41.459]  Laboratory validation is being skipped.
[01:27:41.459 --> 01:27:46.604]  I mean, I spent 18 months validating a quantitation method for glyphosate in my lab.
[01:27:46.604 --> 01:27:47.886]  I know how long this takes.
[01:27:47.886 --> 01:27:49.507]  That's not even with genetics.
[01:27:49.507 --> 01:27:52.510]  That's just liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry.
[01:27:52.510 --> 01:27:54.072]  That took me a year and a half.
[01:27:54.072 --> 01:27:58.837]  You can't make a vaccine in six months unless you skip all the quality control.
[01:27:58.837 --> 01:27:59.938]  That's what I know for sure.
[01:27:59.938 --> 01:28:00.679]  Would you agree with that?
[01:28:02.248 --> 01:28:02.789]  Of course.
[01:28:02.789 --> 01:28:10.094]  This becomes nothing more than a violation of the Nuremberg Code on medical experimentation.
[01:28:10.094 --> 01:28:11.655]  You're exactly right.
[01:28:11.655 --> 01:28:18.580]  As for the CDC, they promised there would be replacement tests put out.
[01:28:18.580 --> 01:28:20.802]  No replacement tests have been put out at all.
[01:28:20.802 --> 01:28:21.323]  That's right.
[01:28:22.421 --> 01:28:23.302]  None.
[01:28:23.302 --> 01:28:30.427]  And by the way, by comparison, in South Korea, I believe they've already tested 30,000 people.
[01:28:30.427 --> 01:28:39.954]  So why weren't those tests here on the spot to use for the benefit of the American people?
[01:28:39.954 --> 01:28:40.875]  It's not even real.
[01:28:40.875 --> 01:28:41.916]  We've got to go to break.
[01:28:41.916 --> 01:28:43.857]  I apologize, Professor Boyle.
[01:28:43.857 --> 01:28:45.438]  We've got to go to break real quick.
[01:28:45.438 --> 01:28:46.659]  We'll be back with more.
[01:28:46.659 --> 01:28:47.120]  Stay with us.
[01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:48.000]  One more segment, please.
[01:28:49.301 --> 01:28:51.185]  Mind-blowing information.
[01:28:51.185 --> 01:28:52.287]  Alex Jones Show.
[01:28:52.287 --> 01:28:52.989]  Mike Adams here.
[01:28:52.989 --> 01:28:53.570]  Stay with us.
[01:28:53.570 --> 01:28:54.351]  One more break.
[01:28:54.351 --> 01:28:54.992]  One more segment.
[01:28:54.992 --> 01:28:55.393]  We'll be back.
[01:28:56.038 --> 01:28:57.259]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:28:57.259 --> 01:29:01.180]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:29:01.180 --> 01:29:02.721]  I sued the IRS and won.
[01:29:02.721 --> 01:29:05.683]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:29:05.683 --> 01:29:11.245]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:29:11.245 --> 01:29:12.446]  I can help you, too.
[01:29:12.446 --> 01:29:15.387]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[01:29:15.387 --> 01:29:17.588]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[01:29:17.588 --> 01:29:22.030]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[01:29:22.030 --> 01:29:24.331]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[01:29:25.709 --> 01:29:29.570]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[01:29:29.570 --> 01:29:34.572]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month, you could fight against heart disease naturally?
[01:29:34.572 --> 01:29:39.394]  At Heart and Body Extract, we've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart.
[01:29:39.394 --> 01:29:40.734]  Don't just take my word for it.
[01:29:40.734 --> 01:29:44.515]  Check out all of the success stories at hbextract.com.

[01:29:46.436 --> 01:29:48.717]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[01:29:56.766 --> 01:29:59.788]  There's a lot of things I can say about the high quality storable food.
[01:29:59.788 --> 01:30:01.509]  We sell it in fullrestore.com.
[01:30:01.509 --> 01:30:07.614]  But everybody knows any product I sell is going to be high quality at a great price because I treat you like I want to be treated.
[01:30:07.614 --> 01:30:10.416]  It is my religion, the golden rule.
[01:30:10.416 --> 01:30:18.501]  But the bad news is our main sponsor that does a great job, MyPatriot, is now three to four weeks out before they ship food.
[01:30:18.501 --> 01:30:20.503]  They have the food, but they've got to package it.
[01:30:20.503 --> 01:30:24.726]  And any day now, they may come and tell me, oh, sorry, we're not selling food anymore.
[01:30:24.926 --> 01:30:27.866]  Because they're not going to take orders for food they don't have.
[01:30:27.866 --> 01:30:31.067]  Now, you get your order in now, you get the high quality food.
[01:30:31.067 --> 01:30:32.107]  It's a smart move.
[01:30:32.107 --> 01:30:33.127]  It funds the M4.
[01:30:33.127 --> 01:30:34.028]  You can't lose.

[01:30:43.009 --> 01:30:44.009]  They're in our back end.
[01:30:44.009 --> 01:30:45.009]  We're partnered with them.
[01:30:45.009 --> 01:30:47.230]  They'll ship it out to you the day it's packaged.
[01:30:47.230 --> 01:30:51.030]  They've got the food, but they are days and days behind shipping it out.
[01:30:51.030 --> 01:30:52.751]  So get your order in now to lock it in.
[01:30:52.751 --> 01:30:53.651]  And it funds the M4, our 360 win.
[01:30:54.633 --> 01:30:55.648]  EvoreStore.com
[01:30:56.883 --> 01:30:59.485]  Alex Jones here with two big announcements.
[01:30:59.485 --> 01:31:06.470]  Ultra 12 and Vitamin Mineral Fusion are both back in stock after being sold out for months.
[01:31:06.470 --> 01:31:17.357]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion is high quality vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and other key cofactors that are so good for you and your family, especially your children's bodies and your immune systems.
[01:31:17.357 --> 01:31:21.440]  Ultra 12 is the highest quality vitamin B12.
[01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:24.502]  Taken sublingually under the tongue, it is back in stock.
[01:31:24.602 --> 01:31:33.833]  You can get them both individually for 40% off right now and get them together as a combo for 50% off.
[01:31:33.833 --> 01:31:41.282]  This makes your life so much better when you have a good multivitamin mineral that you actually absorb and as a tasty fruit punch.
[01:31:41.282 --> 01:31:41.742]  And of course,
[01:31:42.583 --> 01:31:49.334]  Vitamin B12 is the bedrock foundation of energy, stamina, libido, just everything.
[01:31:49.334 --> 01:31:55.423]  And they're both back in stock, 40% off individually or 50% off when you get them together at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:31:57.827 --> 01:32:01.088]  This should really be easier than it is.
[01:32:01.088 --> 01:32:03.228]  I'm not here giving you a sales pitch.
[01:32:03.228 --> 01:32:05.689]  I'm pointing out the way forward.
[01:32:05.689 --> 01:32:19.153]  Things that I've discovered that I absolutely know work that if you listen to me and try them out for yourself you will see how amazing it is and then your support of the product we're selling will help you
[01:32:19.853 --> 01:32:19.913]  I'm
[01:32:36.238 --> 01:32:41.240]  Eight years ago I started taking True Iodine, Atomic Iodine.
[01:32:41.240 --> 01:32:48.922]  We've got it back in stock, X2, 40% off right now at InfoWarStore.com and I'm telling you folks, get it.
[01:32:48.922 --> 01:32:50.103]  It's amazing.
[01:32:50.103 --> 01:32:53.684]  Discover the benefits and it funds the Info War, a 360 win.
[01:32:53.684 --> 01:33:00.386]  You can't lose unless you don't take action.
[01:33:00.386 --> 01:33:03.007]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:15.943 --> 01:33:21.589]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:21.589 --> 01:33:24.873]  And now, your host, Mike Adams.
[01:33:27.023 --> 01:33:41.302]  This has been just an extraordinary conversation already with Professor Francis Boyle, who is the author of really, I think, one of the most important founding documents on biological weapons and treaties and restrictions and so on.
[01:33:42.183 --> 01:33:52.474]  And he is outspoken in terms of, well, just having courage to state what's true and with accuracy as well and without any political overtones.
[01:33:52.474 --> 01:33:55.357]  So, Professor Boyle, thank you for continuing with us.
[01:33:55.357 --> 01:33:57.580]  It's a real pleasure to speak with you.
[01:33:57.580 --> 01:34:03.125]  My question for this segment is, you understand this perhaps more than most, what would be the rational
[01:34:03.846 --> 01:34:08.210]  Deployment plan of any nation that was developing these weapons.
[01:34:08.210 --> 01:34:09.731]  What are they thinking?
[01:34:09.731 --> 01:34:26.564]  Could possibly be a scenario where they could even aggressively use them because with nuclear weapons you have half lives of the radioisotopes nuclear weapons go away Biological weapons self-replicate so you don't have half lives you have doubling time you have are not values How do you ever close that Pandora's box?
[01:34:26.564 --> 01:34:27.345]  What are they thinking?
[01:34:27.345 --> 01:34:30.367]  Mike you're right.
[01:34:30.367 --> 01:34:31.188]  I mean this is a
[01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:39.943]  A Nazi mentality at work that we see at the University of North Carolina.
[01:34:39.943 --> 01:34:48.447]  And I sent you an article, which you mentioned there on your newsletter, that U.S.
[01:34:48.447 --> 01:34:56.210]  biological warfare programs have 13,000 death scientists at work.
[01:34:56.210 --> 01:35:00.372]  And that was as of 2015, the last time I crunched the numbers.
[01:35:01.138 --> 01:35:02.098]  So, you're right.
[01:35:02.098 --> 01:35:25.526]  Now, they justify this by saying, well, once we have developed the biological warfare offensive agent, then we will develop a vaccine so that we can protect ourselves against this Machiavellian monster, this Frankensteinian monster that we have already developed.
[01:35:26.809 --> 01:35:31.646]  And those are the two elements of an effective biological weapon itself.
[01:35:31.646 --> 01:35:32.248]  First, the
[01:35:33.770 --> 01:35:36.612]  The offensive agent, and then second, the vaccine.
[01:35:36.612 --> 01:35:42.516]  Indeed, that's what UNC tried to justify, if you read through it.
[01:35:42.516 --> 01:35:49.781]  Oh, well, there might be this terrible biological warfare agent out there that we need to protect ourselves from.
[01:35:49.781 --> 01:35:58.887]  So, let's develop this terrible biological warfare agent in the first place, and then we can make a vaccine to protect ourselves from it.
[01:35:59.167 --> 01:36:09.855]  It's almost like a mafia shakedown of the taxpayers, where the mafia comes to your retail store in Chicago and says, oh, it sure would be a bad thing if this thing caught fire.
[01:36:09.855 --> 01:36:12.537]  You better pay us so we can protect you from the fire.
[01:36:12.537 --> 01:36:16.981]  I mean, that's what the whole death science industry is doing on a global scale.
[01:36:16.981 --> 01:36:23.426]  They're putting us all at risk so they can make money developing weapons that are designed to exterminate human beings.
[01:36:23.426 --> 01:36:24.427]  How insane is this?
[01:36:26.724 --> 01:36:28.986]  Well, you're right about that, Mike.
[01:36:28.986 --> 01:36:30.628]  It's all about the money.
[01:36:30.628 --> 01:36:35.954]  These so-called best scientists are on a gravy train.
[01:36:35.954 --> 01:36:36.854]  If you look at the
[01:36:38.041 --> 01:36:48.212]  The article I sent you, again, the last time I crunched the numbers from 9-11-2001 until October 2015, the United States government has spent over $100 billion.
[01:36:57.362 --> 01:37:01.285]  On Nazi biological warfare weapons work.
[01:37:01.285 --> 01:37:08.232]  So, of course, it's a gravy train for all these 13,000 death scientists.
[01:37:08.232 --> 01:37:12.235]  And I would add in, it's usually about $5 billion a year.
[01:37:12.235 --> 01:37:16.299]  So, as of today, it's probably in the area of $120 billion.
[01:37:16.299 --> 01:37:19.822]  And now the Democrats are saying, well, let's throw another $8 billion to these Nazis.
[01:37:22.784 --> 01:37:25.845]  That's not going to solve anything.
[01:37:25.845 --> 01:37:31.747]  So, you're perfectly correct, but it's all about the money.
[01:37:31.747 --> 01:37:34.407]  I just want to clarify something.
[01:37:34.407 --> 01:37:37.088]  When you say Nazis, it's not a flippant comment.
[01:37:37.088 --> 01:37:47.231]  You're talking about the historical origins of the intellectual lineage of this research goes back to Nazi Germany, correct?
[01:37:48.651 --> 01:38:15.242]  Well, not only that, Mike, it goes back to the Japanese Imperial Army's occupation of China before and during the Second World War, and they were allies with Hitler and Mussolini, the Pact of Steel, and they had a massive biological warfare weapons program against the Chinese.
[01:38:15.242 --> 01:38:16.623]  When the war ended,
[01:38:17.367 --> 01:38:20.614]  The United States government made a deal with them.
[01:38:21.241 --> 01:38:36.270]  Namely, if you turn over all your biological warfare work, agents, research, etc., and you Nazi death scientists cooperate with us, we will not prosecute you.
[01:38:36.270 --> 01:38:39.272]  So, yes, I'm not exaggerating.
[01:38:39.272 --> 01:38:48.958]  These are the allies of Hitler and Mussolini who were doing this to the Chinese people, and that's where a good deal, although not all of our
[01:38:49.398 --> 01:38:54.521]  So, the origins of this are consistent with the anti-human philosophical slant of eugenicists
[01:39:12.409 --> 01:39:13.610]  That's exactly correct.
[01:39:42.731 --> 01:39:49.737]  And as a matter of fact, as for the eugenics movement, well, that originated here in the United States.
[01:39:49.737 --> 01:39:53.520]  And Hitler and the Nazis thought it was a great idea.
[01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:54.441]  They got it from us.
[01:39:55.297 --> 01:40:04.347]  And eventually they proceeded to apply it, as you said, to the Jews, to the Roma, and to Slavic people.
[01:40:04.347 --> 01:40:07.731]  They were deemed to be in inferior races of people.
[01:40:07.731 --> 01:40:09.493]  That's right.
[01:40:09.493 --> 01:40:13.818]  And some of the funders today, for example, the Rockefeller Institute,
[01:40:14.218 --> 01:40:15.420]  So, yes, that is correct.
[01:40:30.865 --> 01:40:32.747]  All right, we've only got about two minutes left.
[01:40:32.747 --> 01:40:34.208]  I could talk to you for hours.
[01:40:34.208 --> 01:40:36.931]  I mean, this is beyond fascinating.
[01:40:36.931 --> 01:40:42.077]  But where does this go if we don't stop this death science industry?
[01:40:42.077 --> 01:40:43.918]  Where do we end up in another 10 years?
[01:40:43.918 --> 01:40:45.880]  If we even survive that long, who knows?
[01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:53.188]  But if they get better at killing humans, how do we survive this as a species?
[01:40:53.188 --> 01:40:53.909]  That's my question.
[01:40:55.379 --> 01:40:56.299]  Well, I agree with you, Mike.
[01:40:56.299 --> 01:41:05.042]  That's why I drafted my Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989 that provides life imprisonment for all these death scientists.
[01:41:05.042 --> 01:41:11.384]  Certainly, we need immediately to shut down all BSL-3 and BSL-4
[01:41:12.424 --> 01:41:12.824]  I'm good.
[01:41:30.578 --> 01:41:45.102]  The people doing this type of death science research, like the University of North Carolina, they should be investigated and prosecuted for violating my Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act that provides life in prison.
[01:41:45.102 --> 01:41:45.762]  Right.
[01:41:45.762 --> 01:41:51.444]  And that's why I drafted that in the first place, to send a shot across their bowels.
[01:41:51.444 --> 01:41:55.605]  So the universities have become the bioweapons terrorism factories of America?
[01:41:56.707 --> 01:41:58.268]  You're correct.
[01:41:58.268 --> 01:42:13.338]  If you look at these contracts, Harvard, where I went, I have three degrees there, University of Chicago, undergrad, University of North Carolina, here at the University of Illinois.
[01:42:13.338 --> 01:42:13.858]  Right.
[01:42:13.858 --> 01:42:15.780]  They're all on the gravy train.
[01:42:15.780 --> 01:42:17.441]  That's exactly right.
[01:42:17.441 --> 01:42:25.306]  And they don't really care about the existential dangers behind this type of research.
[01:42:25.706 --> 01:42:28.128]  It's unreal.
[01:42:28.128 --> 01:42:29.950]  Professor Boyle, it's an honor to speak with you.
[01:42:29.950 --> 01:42:31.711]  I hope you'll join me again in the future.
[01:42:31.711 --> 01:42:33.913]  It's a real honor to talk to you.
[01:42:33.913 --> 01:42:35.114]  I'm glad that you are there.
[01:42:35.114 --> 01:42:37.215]  Thank you so much for your thoughts today.
[01:42:37.215 --> 01:42:47.103]  Well, thank you, Mike, and keep up the good work with that newsletter, because I read it all the time and use what you're saying there to formulate my own opinion.
[01:42:47.103 --> 01:42:50.006]  Wow, that's an amazing comment.
[01:42:50.006 --> 01:42:51.407]  Thank you so much, Professor Boyle.
[01:42:51.407 --> 01:42:52.608]  This is Mike Adams here.
[01:42:52.608 --> 01:42:54.810]  We'll be right back after this break with more.
[01:42:55.908 --> 01:43:02.412]  Keith Bansumer powers the great line of high-quality, storable food we have available at Ready Hour at ImpulseFoodStore.com.
[01:43:02.412 --> 01:43:04.173]  And yes, we're selling storable food here.
[01:43:04.173 --> 01:43:08.716]  What concerns me is, we're a month into this, and food sales aren't going down, they're going up.
[01:43:08.716 --> 01:43:10.457]  You've never seen anything like this.
[01:43:10.457 --> 01:43:13.079]  Never, never like this, and sustained.
[01:43:13.079 --> 01:43:16.021]  You know, it started, you know, 27 days ago, and it kind of went hyper.
[01:43:16.101 --> 01:43:17.162]  It's just something you cover.
[01:43:47.563 --> 01:43:48.484]  We've got food.
[01:43:48.484 --> 01:43:49.525]  We've got guns.
[01:43:49.525 --> 01:43:50.486]  We've got Jesus.
[01:43:50.486 --> 01:43:51.388]  We know how to use it.
[01:43:51.388 --> 01:43:52.769]  We've got a phrase around here, Alex.
[01:43:52.769 --> 01:43:53.711]  It's real simple.
[01:43:53.711 --> 01:43:54.672]  Noah prepared.
[01:43:55.856 --> 01:43:58.878]  It's no secret that our daily lives are becoming more stressful.

[01:45:09.844 --> 01:45:18.350]  And of course, do not get storable foods or any other types of colloidal nano-silver at InfoWarstore.com.
[01:45:18.350 --> 01:45:20.231]  Do not do it.
[01:45:20.231 --> 01:45:21.792]  Trust CNN.
[01:45:21.792 --> 01:45:23.793]  Trust MSNBC.
[01:45:23.793 --> 01:45:25.454]  Drink fluoridated water.
[01:45:25.954 --> 01:45:34.937]  Just like the loving kiss of a king cobra, pumping deadly, I mean loving, helpful nutrients into your body.
[01:45:34.937 --> 01:45:36.717]  Hug the cobra.
[01:45:36.717 --> 01:45:38.498]  Love the cobra.
[01:45:38.498 --> 01:45:39.998]  Kiss the cobra.
[01:45:39.998 --> 01:45:47.741]  But never, never go to InfoWars.com or InfoWarsStore.com!
[01:45:47.741 --> 01:45:50.681]  Do not order those products!
[01:45:50.681 --> 01:45:52.542]  Silence Jones now!
[01:45:57.375 --> 01:45:59.259]  You want to break some globalist ribs.
[01:45:59.259 --> 01:46:01.082]  You want to crush some skulls politically.
[01:46:01.082 --> 01:46:04.028]  You want to drive ice picks through their eyeballs.
[01:46:04.028 --> 01:46:04.609]  Spiritually.
[01:46:04.609 --> 01:46:06.653]  There's nowhere you can spend money.
[01:46:06.653 --> 01:46:08.216]  There's nowhere you can place your bet.
[01:46:09.833 --> 01:46:12.955]  In a fight where it's gonna have more power per dollar.
[01:46:39.913 --> 01:46:41.854]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:10.419 --> 01:47:12.801]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:47:12.801 --> 01:47:19.966]  It's Alex Jones with Mike Adams.
[01:47:19.966 --> 01:47:29.092]  Sort of a surprise endorsement there from Professor Francis Boyle for the naturalnews.com email newsletter.
[01:47:29.092 --> 01:47:37.198]  Of course, that's my publication and we send out email alerts every day with solutions and things like that.
[01:47:38.098 --> 01:47:40.179]  If you'd like to join that, it's at nationalnews.com.
[01:47:40.179 --> 01:47:41.799]  Sign up for the email newsletter.
[01:47:41.799 --> 01:47:48.781]  We also, of course, publish a lot of Paul Joseph Watson stories and big breaking news here from infowars.com.
[01:47:48.781 --> 01:47:54.782]  There's actually quite a lot of cross-publication of each other's stories, so check it out there.
[01:47:54.782 --> 01:47:56.143]  We send out emails every day.
[01:47:56.143 --> 01:48:01.024]  By the way, for those of you signing up for email newsletters, whether it's InfoWars or us or anybody,
[01:48:01.704 --> 01:48:15.371]  Don't use Gmail and don't use Yahoo Mail and don't use Microsoft Mail because all those three providers, and I'm sure the InfoWars team, technical people can confirm this, they tend to ban independent media emails.
[01:48:15.371 --> 01:48:22.955]  So you should use something more like a ProtonMail.com or a HushMail or some more of an independent email provider.
[01:48:22.955 --> 01:48:24.376]  Otherwise, you're going to get banned.
[01:48:24.376 --> 01:48:28.939]  Like Microsoft banned our emails temporarily a week ago.
[01:48:29.699 --> 01:48:33.721]  And so that was Hotmail and Microsoft or MSN and all that stuff.
[01:48:33.721 --> 01:48:37.043]  And we couldn't deliver emails to all of our Microsoft subscribers.
[01:48:37.043 --> 01:48:39.524]  They just do that to mess with us.
[01:48:39.524 --> 01:48:40.665]  They do it on purpose.
[01:48:40.665 --> 01:48:46.788]  Now, one of the things that we cover is natural molecules, natural supplements, things like that.
[01:48:46.788 --> 01:48:48.990]  And I always promise to show and tell here.
[01:48:48.990 --> 01:48:51.191]  By the way, Alan Keyes is coming up here in just a minute.
[01:48:51.591 --> 01:48:54.173]  But I've got to share this with you because I brought another show and tell.
[01:48:54.173 --> 01:48:56.095]  This is not something that I sell.
[01:48:56.095 --> 01:49:00.118]  This is something that I found, that I discovered in my research.
[01:49:00.118 --> 01:49:02.400]  This is a special spice.
[01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:03.701]  You've got to watch this.
[01:49:03.701 --> 01:49:07.044]  It's called cubeb pepper.
[01:49:07.044 --> 01:49:08.385]  C-U-B-E-B.
[01:49:08.385 --> 01:49:10.087]  Cubeb pepper.
[01:49:10.087 --> 01:49:14.210]  It's also known as java pepper or tailed pepper.
[01:49:14.210 --> 01:49:15.452]  I've got a bowl of it right here.
[01:49:16.132 --> 01:49:26.498]  And this contains the molecule that we spoke about yesterday, henokinin, the same molecule that was in the hinoki wood that we talked about yesterday.
[01:49:26.498 --> 01:49:31.020]  This is the spice that's used to flavor some Russian vodka.
[01:49:31.020 --> 01:49:41.646]  It contains this molecule that has been tested for the 3Cl protease inhibition properties, which may be useful in what we're seeing today.
[01:49:41.646 --> 01:49:45.148]  It's probably going to be studied for a possible future drug.
[01:49:45.868 --> 01:49:49.369]  It doesn't hurt to eat more spices.
[01:49:49.369 --> 01:49:56.870]  And I'm not saying to anybody that you should never take pharmaceuticals or never even consider the vaccine if it's ever made safe.
[01:49:56.870 --> 01:49:59.451]  I'm just saying, look, there's nothing else available.
[01:49:59.451 --> 01:50:01.651]  Why not spice up your life?
[01:50:01.651 --> 01:50:04.572]  You know, why not just have better food, better cuisine?
[01:50:04.572 --> 01:50:08.992]  I've talked about Indian cuisine, like Lebanese food, Middle Eastern food, all these spices.
[01:50:08.992 --> 01:50:11.493]  This is another spice, kubeb pepper.
[01:50:12.173 --> 01:50:13.054]  You can get it.
[01:50:13.054 --> 01:50:17.936]  I think it's sold on Amazon and spice companies and herb companies and places like that.
[01:50:17.936 --> 01:50:21.198]  Again, it's called Java pepper or tailed pepper.
[01:50:21.198 --> 01:50:23.559]  This is something that I'm and it tastes amazing.
[01:50:23.559 --> 01:50:26.981]  It's like an explosion of 50 different spices right in your mouth.
[01:50:26.981 --> 01:50:28.622]  It's not peppery like black pepper.
[01:50:28.622 --> 01:50:32.344]  It's more like a nutmeg, cinnamon, mint explosion.
[01:50:32.344 --> 01:50:33.284]  It's nuts.
[01:50:33.284 --> 01:50:34.585]  It's crazy.
[01:50:34.585 --> 01:50:38.707]  If I ate it right now, I probably couldn't speak and I couldn't introduce Alan Keyes.
[01:50:38.707 --> 01:50:40.188]  So I'm not going to eat it at the moment.
[01:50:40.808 --> 01:50:43.309]  But this is the kind of thing to check out.
[01:50:43.309 --> 01:50:45.830]  Now, every day I'm going to bring you something, OK?
[01:50:45.830 --> 01:50:46.470]  That's my promise.
[01:50:46.470 --> 01:50:50.812]  I'm hosting for the next couple of days, along with Alan Keyes, who's one of my favorite people.
[01:50:50.812 --> 01:50:52.373]  I love to talk with Alan Keyes.
[01:50:52.373 --> 01:50:56.154]  And Alan, I'm not going to take too much time from you today.
[01:50:56.154 --> 01:51:00.236]  I know you have a guest coming up, but welcome to the show, Alan.
[01:51:00.236 --> 01:51:02.917]  Can you also tell us who's your guest coming up?
[01:51:02.917 --> 01:51:05.558]  Because I'm not familiar with this guest.
[01:51:05.558 --> 01:51:08.139]  Oh, our guest coming up is John Michael Chambers.
[01:51:09.353 --> 01:51:17.055]  And he's going to be, well, we're going to be going back and forth a little bit about what the media is pleased to call the purge at the White House.
[01:51:17.055 --> 01:51:19.036]  A term that I don't particularly care for.
[01:51:19.036 --> 01:51:20.716]  Well, you are outstanding.
[01:51:20.716 --> 01:51:22.777]  I'm going to turn the show over to you.
[01:51:22.777 --> 01:51:28.658]  I thank you for who you are and what you do and your willingness to speak the truth every day here.
[01:51:28.658 --> 01:51:30.319]  It's just an honor to know you, Alan.
[01:51:30.319 --> 01:51:31.939]  So I'm going to turn the show over to you right now.
[01:51:32.469 --> 01:51:33.049]  Well, thank you.
[01:51:33.049 --> 01:51:35.270]  It's an honor to be in your company.
[01:51:35.270 --> 01:51:44.333]  And I'm glad to know that we're both of us now doing a good turn for Alex Jones and for the network.
[01:51:44.333 --> 01:51:45.133]  Absolutely.
[01:51:45.133 --> 01:51:53.656]  Because I think that it's all vitally important and that we mutually reinforce one another in these trying times is particularly important.
[01:51:53.656 --> 01:51:55.276]  So, God bless you, Mike.
[01:51:55.276 --> 01:51:55.776]  God bless you.
[01:51:55.776 --> 01:51:56.497]  Take it away.
[01:51:56.497 --> 01:51:56.757]  Take care.
[01:51:57.817 --> 01:52:05.246]  Well, I'm Alan Keyes, and we're going to be talking to you today a little bit about a number of things.
[01:52:05.246 --> 01:52:16.100]  But one of them, to start out with, is I'm going to share with John Michael Chambers, who is somebody, by the way, who if you don't know him, he's the author of a book called Trump and the Resurrection of America.
[01:52:16.900 --> 01:52:21.662]  He has done a lot of writing and thinking about the significance of the Trump phenomenon.
[01:52:21.662 --> 01:52:31.425]  He was somebody who had actually given up on American politics and thought that it was just going to be alienated from the grassroots for good and all with the way things were going.
[01:52:31.425 --> 01:52:41.388]  And then in 2016, I think Trump surprised him a little bit and things look like we have a cope that they can be turned around in terms of
[01:52:42.668 --> 01:52:50.991]  Disappointing, Nancy Pelosi's expectation that our elections aren't going to matter very much, because they should be mattering a lot.
[01:52:50.991 --> 01:53:00.874]  And once again I'm joined by my good friend, and the inspiration by the way for IMTV, which is the network where I broadcast my show, Let's Talk America.
[01:53:02.123 --> 01:53:10.907]  And we're going to be talking to John about the present situation where you're hearing all these things about purges going on at the White House.
[01:53:10.907 --> 01:53:28.355]  I think what it actually amounts to is finally getting around, after all of this shenanigans with the phony impeachment and all of this junk, that Donald Trump has finally been freed to get around to the business of taking over the government of the United States.
[01:53:28.355 --> 01:53:30.056]  You know, presidents are supposed to do that.
[01:53:30.915 --> 01:53:32.977]  So, welcome to the show, John.
[01:53:32.977 --> 01:53:35.039]  It's great to have you on.
[01:53:35.039 --> 01:53:37.621]  Appreciate your being with us.
[01:53:37.621 --> 01:53:38.882]  Is he there?
[01:53:38.882 --> 01:53:40.483]  Not yet.
[01:53:40.483 --> 01:53:42.004]  John will be with us in a moment.
[01:53:42.004 --> 01:53:42.544]  Oh, there he is!
[01:53:42.544 --> 01:53:44.186]  Hi, John.
[01:53:44.186 --> 01:53:45.026]  How are you?
[01:53:45.026 --> 01:53:45.807]  Hi.
[01:53:45.807 --> 01:53:46.588]  I'm good, Alan.
[01:53:46.588 --> 01:53:47.448]  Nice to see you.
[01:53:47.448 --> 01:53:49.450]  And Bob, you're on InfoWards.
[01:53:50.605 --> 01:53:51.686]  Yes, indeed.
[01:53:51.686 --> 01:54:00.334]  And we're talking, I think, about one of the aspects of the warfare that's been going on politically in this country.
[01:54:00.334 --> 01:54:12.025]  I find it strange that we're now being feted to a view that suggests that when the President goes about the business of making sure the White House is staffed,
[01:54:12.569 --> 01:54:20.112]  With people who represent his policies and his point of view, it's some kind of purge.
[01:54:20.112 --> 01:54:24.033]  That's just the normal business of a new administration taking over.
[01:54:24.033 --> 01:54:34.097]  These jokers are trying to get us to accept the notion that government should remain the same no matter what the result of an election.
[01:54:34.097 --> 01:54:34.937]  I think that's crazy.
[01:54:36.789 --> 01:54:37.710]  Well, it is crazy.
[01:54:37.710 --> 01:54:41.492]  The deep state and the Democrats' spin on this is just that.
[01:54:41.492 --> 01:54:42.152]  It's spin.
[01:54:42.152 --> 01:54:48.196]  The President, as you know, has the right to choose people in certain positions.
[01:54:48.196 --> 01:54:50.698]  And then the rest of us do that at the ballot box.
[01:54:50.698 --> 01:54:54.940]  So if the Democrats don't care for it, well, too bad.
[01:54:54.940 --> 01:54:56.501]  I mean, this is a purge.
[01:54:56.501 --> 01:55:00.724]  If they think there's a purge going on right now, wait till they see what's coming.
[01:55:02.216 --> 01:55:03.937]  Well, see, I have been a little disturbed.
[01:55:03.937 --> 01:55:18.481]  The other day, I was doing, well, it's extraneous what I was doing, but I went to the page for IO, which is the bureau in the State Department that I used to head up, international organizations.
[01:55:18.481 --> 01:55:23.663]  And I was surprised to see that they still had an acting Assistant Secretary of State.
[01:55:23.663 --> 01:55:30.345]  I mean, here we are, a solid three years into the new administration, and you don't have
[01:55:32.060 --> 01:55:41.006]  Assistant Secretary of State chosen by and reflecting the policies and viewpoint of the President, reliably.
[01:55:41.006 --> 01:55:43.327]  At least that was the impression I got.
[01:55:43.327 --> 01:55:44.368]  I don't know.
[01:55:44.368 --> 01:55:51.332]  But it seems to me that if that's going on at various levels of the government, we've got a serious problem.
[01:55:51.332 --> 01:55:59.257]  And that problem is a problem that is now being aggravated by all these Democrats who are trying to give the impression that somehow or another
[01:55:59.950 --> 01:56:05.652]  Elections shouldn't matter very much and the government personnel should remain the same and so forth and so on.
[01:56:05.652 --> 01:56:16.676]  Where do they get this idea that that is not what's supposed to be happening after an election where the people decide they want a change of direction?
[01:56:16.676 --> 01:56:29.001]  Well because it's in their best interest because they have an awful lot to hide is the situation and they know what's coming because we're at the exposure phase
[01:56:29.904 --> 01:56:31.805]  Of draining the swamp.
[01:56:31.805 --> 01:56:33.626]  We've exposing.
[01:56:33.626 --> 01:56:38.369]  And now we've entered the next bit where we're sort of in a shakedown mode.
[01:56:38.369 --> 01:56:40.291]  And soon the takedown.
[01:56:40.291 --> 01:56:41.291]  The hammer of justice.
[01:56:41.291 --> 01:56:42.912]  And they know this is coming.
[01:56:42.912 --> 01:56:49.096]  And so it doesn't surprise me that they express their views as such in terms of the purge.
[01:56:49.096 --> 01:56:51.658]  But look, Gordon Sondland was one of the purge, right?
[01:56:51.658 --> 01:56:57.001]  Well, he was the no witness witness in the impeachment hoax in the House.
[01:56:58.826 --> 01:56:59.186]  I don't know.
[01:57:24.082 --> 01:57:41.394]  When we come back, let's explore that a little bit more in detail, and I'll try to explain why I take such exception to the word purge, because I think it is just beyond the pale for me of the words that we should be using to describe what is happening after one of our free elections.
[01:57:41.394 --> 01:57:42.075]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:46.863 --> 01:57:47.644]  Real stuff, man.
[01:57:47.644 --> 01:57:49.045]  We're talking about the real deal here.
[01:57:49.045 --> 01:57:54.290]  And I love Trump all day long, but man, I tell you, he sits there and lets these big tech people keep running roughshod over him.
[01:57:54.290 --> 01:57:57.153]  Everybody, I mean, I've got a problem.
[01:57:57.153 --> 01:57:58.855]  And we'll just take the Trump rallies over.
[01:57:58.855 --> 01:58:02.098]  That said, about two months ago, I came up with a plan that I haven't launched yet.
[01:58:02.638 --> 01:58:06.500]  We have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers.
[01:58:06.500 --> 01:58:07.741]  20 different stickers.
[01:58:07.741 --> 01:58:09.361]  Impeach the Democrats.
[01:58:09.361 --> 01:58:10.422]  Save the Second Amendment.
[01:58:10.422 --> 01:58:11.522]  Defend the First Amendment.
[01:58:11.522 --> 01:58:12.843]  Infowars.com.
[01:58:12.843 --> 01:58:14.264]  And it looks like duct tape.
[01:58:14.264 --> 01:58:15.024]  It's just a regular sticker.
[01:58:15.024 --> 01:58:16.024]  You put it over your mouth.
[01:58:16.024 --> 01:58:17.345]  You go to a Trump rally.
[01:58:17.345 --> 01:58:19.826]  And you instantly take over without even disrupting things.
[01:58:19.826 --> 01:58:21.367]  People say, why are you doing this?
[01:58:21.367 --> 01:58:21.907]  What's happening?
[01:58:21.907 --> 01:58:23.428]  Well, you go, well, we're being censored.
[01:58:23.428 --> 01:58:25.409]  You know, Trump won't do anything about it.
[01:58:25.669 --> 01:58:28.851]  And Dr. Petchenik, let me just ask you what you think, because I've not watched this yet.
[01:58:28.851 --> 01:58:29.831]  It's brilliant.
[01:58:29.831 --> 01:58:36.914]  You've taken the very element that they try to repress you with, that's silence, and made it into a weapon.
[01:58:36.914 --> 01:58:39.856]  You have the loudest sound of all, silence.
[01:58:39.856 --> 01:58:42.697]  And you know what's most disturbing to people?
[01:58:42.697 --> 01:58:46.519]  Silence.
[01:58:46.519 --> 01:58:48.220]  I love watching David Knight in the morning.
[01:58:48.220 --> 01:58:50.341]  I love tuning in to Owen Schroer.
[01:58:50.341 --> 01:58:52.101]  I love all the other shows we do here.
[01:58:52.101 --> 01:58:52.982]  But I'll be honest with you.
[01:58:53.826 --> 01:58:59.172]  We run during the breaks a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads.
[01:58:59.172 --> 01:59:01.054]  So you think you don't want to hear an ad?
[01:59:01.054 --> 01:59:02.335]  I don't want to hear an ad.
[01:59:02.335 --> 01:59:04.097]  But here's the bottom line.
[01:59:04.097 --> 01:59:05.578]  We're barely paying the bills here.
[01:59:05.578 --> 01:59:08.281]  And I want to expand to the face of the globalist, not contract.
[01:59:08.281 --> 01:59:09.442]  I don't want them to win.
[01:59:09.442 --> 01:59:11.384]  So listen, you've got this guarantee from me.
[01:59:12.335 --> 01:59:15.457]  We sell enough product, we'll have less ads and less plugs.
[01:59:15.457 --> 01:59:18.619]  And we'll expand and really give the globalists around for their money.
[01:59:18.619 --> 01:59:22.402]  But we've got products you already really need, like DNA Force Plus, X2.
[01:59:22.402 --> 01:59:23.983]  These will change your life.
[01:59:23.983 --> 01:59:25.384]  Go check out the turmeric products.
[01:59:25.384 --> 01:59:27.385]  Check out the water filtration, air filtration.
[01:59:27.385 --> 01:59:28.086]  Check it all out.
[01:59:28.086 --> 01:59:30.027]  Whatever you do, take action and know.
[01:59:30.027 --> 01:59:31.828]  Be part of the Second American Revolution.
[01:59:31.828 --> 01:59:33.309]  Be part of crushing the globalists.
[01:59:33.309 --> 01:59:34.790]  And get great products at the same time.
[01:59:34.790 --> 01:59:37.252]  InfoWarsStore.com is the umbrella site.
[01:59:37.252 --> 01:59:39.433]  InfoWarsLife.com is the supplements.
[01:59:39.433 --> 01:59:42.295]  Take action now and fund the InfoWars for your own future.
[01:59:42.295 --> 01:59:42.675]  Welcome back.
[02:00:06.946 --> 02:00:18.198]  Now I want to spend a second or two to explain why it is I'm so sensitive about this word purge, because I'm part of that generation that came along thinking of this as the United States of America.
[02:00:18.198 --> 02:00:20.401]  You'll forgive me for that, right?
[02:00:20.401 --> 02:00:26.688]  We're not the Socialist Republics of America, we're not the Communist Party of America, none of this junk that is now being
[02:00:27.526 --> 02:00:33.528]  Offered us on the table, which I consider to be poison for the body politic of the United States.
[02:00:33.528 --> 02:00:35.769]  None of that was in the air.
[02:00:35.769 --> 02:00:56.616]  It was, by and large, taken for granted that on a bipartisan basis, we all were against turning this country into one of those regimented Communist Party regimes that only looked like they had elections, but where things didn't really change until the infighting was done among a little group of people who actually ran the country.
[02:00:57.276 --> 02:01:11.921]  This is how a lot of these politicians, and I have to say there are particularly a lot of Democrats, but you see a little bit of that on both sides of the aisle, they want us now to get into this mentality, to get used to living in a country that has this communist parlance going on, and I can't stand it!
[02:01:11.921 --> 02:01:22.925]  We don't have purges in America, we have elections, and after elections, changes will be made to reflect what will be, if it is appropriate after the election, changes in policy,
[02:01:23.465 --> 02:01:29.530]  That the people have decided by deciding who they want to represent them in the White House.
[02:01:29.530 --> 02:01:32.213]  And that being the case, they're perfectly normal.
[02:01:32.213 --> 02:01:34.595]  It's not some abnormal abuse of power.
[02:01:34.595 --> 02:01:37.658]  I know these people have been trying to give this impression.
[02:01:37.658 --> 02:01:39.079]  But it's not at all.
[02:01:39.079 --> 02:01:49.208]  Why they think that they have the prerogative of making sure that the President has to work with people who don't accept his policies is beyond me.
[02:01:50.345 --> 02:02:02.775]  But he not only should be working to make sure he has such people, it is perfectly okay, and it's essential to making sure that the election is actually reflected in the way the government changes.
[02:02:02.775 --> 02:02:03.856]  And things have been belated.
[02:02:03.856 --> 02:02:12.303]  They've been trying to delay this process and confuse this process ever since Trump got into office, and it's not a good thing for America.
[02:02:12.303 --> 02:02:13.284]  Am I wrong about that, John?
[02:02:15.325 --> 02:02:17.567]  You're 100 percent accurate and spot on.
[02:02:17.567 --> 02:02:24.994]  I mean, what's happening is is the draining of the swamp, as I was explaining, is exposure, takedown, shakedown.
[02:02:24.994 --> 02:02:28.858]  What we have happening here, and they're not used to it, it's the rule of law.
[02:02:28.858 --> 02:02:32.662]  The rule of law reset is returning to America and they're panicking.
[02:02:33.254 --> 02:02:36.836]  They're panicking, thus false flags and so forth and so on.
[02:02:36.836 --> 02:02:39.879]  But look, it's just getting started.
[02:02:39.879 --> 02:02:50.426]  Don't forget, let us know, there's been over at least 22 firings and or resignations within the FBI just since Donald Trump's been in office, and we're just getting started.
[02:02:50.426 --> 02:02:55.469]  Again, as Lindsey Graham just stated, and this is a paraphrase, but he said about 50% of those people
[02:02:56.870 --> 02:03:00.131]  Uh, involved in the Russian hoax, are going to jail.
[02:03:00.131 --> 02:03:09.733]  And Lindsey Graham is conducting, in the Senate Judiciary hearings, he's told us, of course, he's, uh, test- 21 people are going to be called in to testify.
[02:03:09.733 --> 02:03:13.534]  And these are the people that we finally want to see on the carpet, under oath.
[02:03:13.534 --> 02:03:16.555]  Things are about to get very, very real, my friends at InfoWars.
[02:03:16.555 --> 02:03:17.155]  Very real.
[02:03:17.155 --> 02:03:18.235]  Something we've been waiting for.
[02:03:18.235 --> 02:03:20.216]  Uh, because John Durham is at a-
[02:03:21.156 --> 02:03:27.920]  You have been talking to me and to us about this on Let's Talk America for quite a while.
[02:03:27.920 --> 02:03:39.427]  And I think things were postponed a little bit by all of the furor that was created by the phony impeachment process and the whole way that that sad sham was handled.
[02:03:39.427 --> 02:03:48.813]  But I'm hoping that upcoming election notwithstanding, the President's getting down to business and the business of making sure
[02:03:49.591 --> 02:04:07.564]  Uh, that this administration has a good hold on the government and will continue to take it in the right direction, uh, in spite of what some people think ought to be the dominance of our government by the elements of the deep state that have already shown that they have no particular loyalty to Donald Trump.
[02:04:07.984 --> 02:04:22.116]  But what's more important, they have no particular loyalty to the Constitution, to the integrity of our process, of our national security, or of the respect that is owed to due process and truth in the justice system.
[02:04:22.116 --> 02:04:24.038]  We're seeing it infect everything now.
[02:04:24.778 --> 02:04:35.928]  Including the judicial process and other things that are going on where biases are being confessed and admitted that simply shouldn't be part of our judicial process.
[02:04:35.928 --> 02:04:38.691]  We'll get more in-depth into that right after this.
[02:04:54.987 --> 02:04:56.910]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[02:04:56.910 --> 02:05:01.856]  Coronavirus is a man-made bioweapon designed to destroy nation-states.
[02:05:05.220 --> 02:05:06.821]  A planetary government.
[02:05:06.821 --> 02:05:09.243]  This is how the globalists are striking back.
[02:05:09.243 --> 02:05:11.325]  Here's a fortune headline today.
[02:05:11.325 --> 02:05:18.210]  Fears of global coronavirus contagion rage as 3,000 cruise ship passengers return home.
[02:05:18.210 --> 02:05:20.752]  And that's just in one nation.
[02:05:20.752 --> 02:05:25.536]  Coronavirus deals major blow to German car factories in China.
[02:05:25.536 --> 02:05:29.719]  They're reporting it could cut their sales in half this year.
[02:05:30.519 --> 02:05:33.701]  That's how major this is.
[02:05:33.701 --> 02:05:35.402]  Everyone needs to be prepared.
[02:05:35.402 --> 02:05:39.145]  2020 is not a year to play games.
[02:05:39.145 --> 02:05:48.391]  InfoWars will continue to report the latest information as it comes out, regardless of the fact that the establishment will try to punish us for telling the truth.
[02:05:48.391 --> 02:05:54.015]  We need you to step to the plate and help spread the word about Bandop Video and InfoWars.com today.
[02:06:06.304 --> 02:06:10.366]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news.
[02:06:10.366 --> 02:06:14.549]  Today, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:18.748 --> 02:06:19.389]  Welcome back.
[02:06:19.389 --> 02:06:26.232]  I am so glad that I am working today in the context of Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[02:06:26.232 --> 02:06:40.358]  I'm especially glad because with all this coronavirus thing going on, it's good to be working for folks who are in the business of helping people both take care of their health in the normal course of things, but also become increasingly aware of
[02:06:40.838 --> 02:06:53.544]  Of the environment that we are now in and operating in, where people might need to know that you don't have to rely on what appears to be an increasingly questionable system.
[02:06:53.544 --> 02:07:02.408]  You can get the kind of information you need to take control of your health, of your weight, and also to deal with things like the coronavirus when it comes down to it.
[02:07:02.908 --> 02:07:05.812]  Understand it better, but also to deal with it.
[02:07:05.812 --> 02:07:11.319]  And that's part of why I feel that we're in the right place at the right time right now.
[02:07:11.319 --> 02:07:12.260]  What do you think, Bob?
[02:07:12.260 --> 02:07:13.442]  Well, absolutely.
[02:07:13.442 --> 02:07:17.146]  And we have all these great products that we get from InfoWars.
[02:07:17.146 --> 02:07:19.690]  We also get stuff from Mike Adams, too.
[02:07:19.690 --> 02:07:20.511]  We love Mike.
[02:07:20.976 --> 02:07:34.585]  But I wanted to ask John Michael, because before you do that, though, I have to particularly I said it yesterday, but I want to particularly repeat that when I'm talking about these products, I have always been in the habit when I was doing radio and everything else.
[02:07:34.585 --> 02:07:36.346]  I don't talk about products till I use them.
[02:07:37.026 --> 02:07:50.792]  And I've been using the Alex Jones products and I have to tell you, I am really impressed with the effect that they have with the efficacy of both the vitamin packs that I've been taking.
[02:07:50.792 --> 02:07:53.894]  I've been using the colloidal silver, the toothpaste.
[02:07:55.035 --> 02:07:57.278]  It has been a work in wonders.
[02:07:57.278 --> 02:08:07.110]  So I hope that you all will know that this isn't just a matter of, you know, promoting things because I'm sitting here and feel like I owe it to the folks who are sponsoring.
[02:08:07.110 --> 02:08:09.172]  No, I think we owe it to you.
[02:08:09.853 --> 02:08:25.298]  To share this with you because part of the truth about the universe that you're drawn into when you're watching InfoWars is that trying to communicate with people, to give them both truth and substantive products that help you to take charge of your life.
[02:08:25.962 --> 02:08:30.005]  Remember, this is supposed to be government of, by, and for the people.
[02:08:30.005 --> 02:08:39.151]  But everything that goes on now, all the messages they're beaming at you, are leading people to think, I'll just passively wait until somebody spoon-feeds me the answer.
[02:08:39.151 --> 02:08:40.912]  That's not what InfoWars is about.
[02:08:40.912 --> 02:08:47.036]  It's not what we're about, Bob and I. And I hope it's not what you're about anymore, because we need to be active.
[02:08:47.036 --> 02:08:50.518]  Now, you were going to talk... Well, I wanted to ask John Michael.
[02:08:50.518 --> 02:08:52.880]  He's got his pen on.
[02:08:52.880 --> 02:08:55.682]  John Michael, is that a Q-pen you have?
[02:08:57.323 --> 02:09:00.124]  Well, it's the American flag with the letter Q in it.
[02:09:00.124 --> 02:09:03.946]  Yes, that would be correct.
[02:09:03.946 --> 02:09:08.508]  This is the same pin that Donald Trump Jr.
[02:09:08.508 --> 02:09:15.131]  wore on Tucker Carlson and Eric wore on Laura Ingraham and the two people at the
[02:09:16.431 --> 02:09:17.713]  I'm wearing a Q-Pin today.
[02:09:34.614 --> 02:09:42.220]  Well, you need to spend a moment or two for folks in Alex Jones' audience who might or might not know, what is the significance of the pen?
[02:10:02.472 --> 02:10:07.794]  Well, Q stands for QAnon, which is highly controversial.
[02:10:07.794 --> 02:10:18.238]  The fact that CNN tells everyone not to be looking at Q tells me we should probably be looking at Q. They try to discredit it, but these are the same people that brought to us the fact that Donald Trump is a Russian spy.
[02:10:18.238 --> 02:10:29.522]  So, I don't hold much credence to what they say, but look, QAnon, if people do the homework and the research, is the most intelligent military intel operation in modern history.
[02:10:32.495 --> 02:10:35.118]  I decided to wear my Q pin.
[02:10:35.118 --> 02:10:36.660]  Why not spread the word about Q?
[02:10:38.675 --> 02:10:39.035]  Yes.
[02:10:39.035 --> 02:10:48.504]  We certainly have been in need, in the last little while, of getting information to try to make heads or tails of what's going on with this coronavirus.
[02:10:48.504 --> 02:10:52.267]  Now I know that, like everything else, you try to stay on top of things like that.
[02:10:52.267 --> 02:11:04.898]  What's your sense of what's actually going on now with the coronavirus, its origins and its potential impact, but also, I would say, its significance
[02:11:05.598 --> 02:11:15.550]  In terms of the pressures that are being brought now against Donald Trump, against the United States, against our system of self-government, what's happening?
[02:11:15.550 --> 02:11:17.092]  Everything has failed.
[02:11:17.092 --> 02:11:23.199]  All the coup d'etat attempts, hoax and shams from the beginning, we don't need to name them, Alex's audience knows very well.
[02:11:24.535 --> 02:11:25.776]  These things have failed.
[02:11:25.776 --> 02:11:31.998]  So now they're ramping up the game because they know they can't beat Trump in 2020.
[02:11:31.998 --> 02:11:42.443]  I couldn't agree with Alex more on the fact that the coronavirus is a man-made weapon to do the ultimate takeover, population reduction, so forth and so on.
[02:11:42.443 --> 02:11:42.843]  But you know,
[02:11:43.523 --> 02:11:47.046]  Infowar, yes, it's also an intelligence war, an intelligence battle.
[02:11:47.046 --> 02:11:55.252]  And I'm going to very quickly and calmly connect the dots because, you know, I don't watch a lot of sports and I certainly don't watch a lot of Hollywood.
[02:11:55.252 --> 02:11:58.074]  But I'll tell you what, here's what I watch.
[02:11:58.074 --> 02:12:05.799]  We have here Lindsey Graham's Judiciary Senate hearings pulling in 21 people to testify under oath.
[02:12:05.799 --> 02:12:06.840]  About what?
[02:12:06.840 --> 02:12:09.242]  About FISA warrants, how they were obtained.
[02:12:09.981 --> 02:12:13.362]  About how the dossier came to be and was funded.
[02:12:13.362 --> 02:12:15.362]  In there is everything we need.
[02:12:15.362 --> 02:12:20.664]  Number two, we have the federal death penalty reinstated by Attorney General Barr.
[02:12:20.664 --> 02:12:22.224]  What other dot would we like to connect?
[02:12:22.224 --> 02:12:30.286]  As reported by, I believe, the Washington Times last year, and I wrote an article on it on my website, johnmichaelchambers.com, about Gitmo.
[02:12:30.286 --> 02:12:37.028]  Gitmo, they're talking about Gitmo tribunals being live streamed.
[02:12:37.028 --> 02:12:38.708]  Then we have, of course, Weinstein,
[02:12:39.241 --> 02:12:39.601]  I don't know.
[02:13:02.373 --> 02:13:06.135]  Because it's now reached Attorney General Barr's desk, officially coming into the government.
[02:13:06.135 --> 02:13:15.321]  So, this is what's happening while we're being distracted by false flags and all the noise from the deep state, the Democrats and the fake news media.
[02:13:15.321 --> 02:13:16.982]  These are the dots to be connecting.
[02:13:16.982 --> 02:13:19.963]  The stage is being set and justice is coming.
[02:13:19.963 --> 02:13:22.945]  I know a lot of Americans believe the big names will never be taken down.
[02:13:22.945 --> 02:13:23.486]  Well, you know what?
[02:13:23.486 --> 02:13:24.566]  I beg to differ.
[02:13:24.566 --> 02:13:26.607]  Because here's the bottom line.
[02:13:26.607 --> 02:13:27.328]  It's either us
[02:13:28.095 --> 02:13:28.955]  With them.
[02:13:28.955 --> 02:13:30.756]  That's where we are in this battle.
[02:13:30.756 --> 02:13:38.238]  And we didn't come this far with all the things that Trump has accomplished with all the barriers that he's overcome and we're still fighting many battles as you know.
[02:13:38.238 --> 02:13:39.918]  I believe we come out winners.
[02:13:39.918 --> 02:13:40.618]  We are winning.
[02:13:40.618 --> 02:13:46.580]  I just connected the dots on a few things that should be on mainstream news every night and in fact aren't.
[02:13:46.580 --> 02:13:54.482]  So and I also believe that the economy will survive the attack that it's under right now and this attack
[02:13:54.810 --> 02:13:55.391]  We're good to go.
[02:14:10.208 --> 02:14:12.009]  Isn't that kind of nice?
[02:14:12.009 --> 02:14:12.889]  In this year.
[02:14:12.889 --> 02:14:18.352]  Later on, there's a whole other talk to have in the economy, but I believe we're going to win this battle.
[02:14:18.352 --> 02:14:22.774]  And they're evil, they're monsters, and they're trying to take over the world.
[02:14:22.774 --> 02:14:25.355]  And that's what this weaponization is all about.
[02:14:25.355 --> 02:14:28.156]  And like everything else, this one too is going to fail.
[02:14:28.156 --> 02:14:32.298]  And I can't wait to hear what the President has to say in his briefing tonight.
[02:14:32.298 --> 02:14:36.159]  But I think he's going to calm the fears, calm the nerves, and we're going to get through this, America.
[02:14:36.159 --> 02:14:37.280]  We're going to get through this one too.
[02:14:38.123 --> 02:14:57.093]  Well, I noticed a while back, and I think I've mentioned it on this air before, that when the President talked to Xi Jinping back in January, end of January, as the coronavirus thing was rearing its head, he said, or reported in one of his tweets,
[02:14:58.218 --> 02:15:07.984]  And it was a statement that I think he was making, in which he said that he thought that this would abate, start abating when the weather got warmer.
[02:15:07.984 --> 02:15:16.269]  Implying, I think, a connection between the coronavirus strain that we're dealing with and hot weather.
[02:15:16.269 --> 02:15:27.215]  I've noticed reports coming out that suggest, and I don't know whether it's because of inadequate reporting or because of the climate, that South America and Africa haven't been very hard hit.
[02:15:27.859 --> 02:15:47.543]  And that's an interesting thing if it correlates in terms of the fact that a lot of the countries there are on the equator, you're dealing with a climate where folks are dealing with hotter temperatures longer throughout more of the year, except in certain parts of South America.
[02:15:47.543 --> 02:15:49.363]  And so it could be an interesting correlation.
[02:15:49.363 --> 02:15:52.564]  We'll get in to more in all of that right after we get back.
[02:15:54.158 --> 02:15:57.160]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[02:15:57.160 --> 02:16:00.082]  So do you know who's on your wireless network?

[02:17:57.922 --> 02:18:01.926]  This coronavirus is serious on multiple levels.
[02:18:01.926 --> 02:18:03.227]  It's very communicable.
[02:18:03.227 --> 02:18:05.229]  It spreads very, very fast.
[02:18:05.229 --> 02:18:07.211]  It is killing a lot of people.
[02:18:07.211 --> 02:18:10.935]  And the Chinese Communist government has covered up just how bad it is.
[02:18:10.935 --> 02:18:13.878]  And the White House is now openly challenging them.
[02:18:13.878 --> 02:18:16.981]  So are Trump's top scientists, and so is Senator Cotton.
[02:18:17.762 --> 02:18:22.406]  My friends, now is the time to get prepared.
[02:18:22.406 --> 02:18:24.748]  2020 is not a year to play games with.
[02:18:24.748 --> 02:18:28.492]  The globalists are trying to create economic collapse, race riots.
[02:18:28.492 --> 02:18:31.394]  We don't know how bad this virus is going to get here.
[02:18:31.394 --> 02:18:34.937]  That's why listeners to InfoWars need to be prepared.
[02:18:34.937 --> 02:18:38.020]  InfoWarsStore.com has the products that
[02:18:38.080 --> 02:18:38.720]  We're good to go.

[02:19:01.245 --> 02:19:05.527]  There are many reasons why we need to think about what is really in the air around us.
[02:19:05.527 --> 02:19:09.969]  We may not be able to stop breathing, but we can control what's in the air we breathe.

[02:19:57.811 --> 02:20:00.495]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:15.359 --> 02:20:29.490]  We've been talking about a range of things, but a lot of it has to do with what is going on that impacts the environment that we'll be dealing with as we run up to the election.
[02:20:29.490 --> 02:20:32.573]  And I think a lot of forces are at work, you've probably noticed.
[02:20:32.573 --> 02:20:42.661]  We have been watching it for weeks, months even, as they try to create an environment that's deeply prejudiced against President Trump in all kinds of ways.
[02:20:43.561 --> 02:20:46.424]  But then you have to also think about the events that are taking place.
[02:20:46.424 --> 02:20:51.748]  And John, what is your sense, given what's been happening on the stock market?
[02:20:51.748 --> 02:20:56.872]  It appears to be related to the coronavirus outbreak.
[02:20:56.872 --> 02:21:10.222]  Now, I have been listening to Mike Adams and to Alex and to others, and it looks to me like we have to factor in as a good possibility that we are, in fact, going to see a domestic effect.
[02:21:11.162 --> 02:21:22.688]  Whether it's actually in terms of communal outbreaks, I noticed that one official was warning the American people that we have to brace ourselves for outbreaks of the coronavirus in our communities.
[02:21:22.688 --> 02:21:34.353]  Since they haven't really been handing out these test kits, it seems to me that they might be priming the pump to make sure we get some such outbreaks that will then perhaps panic the public a little bit.
[02:21:35.294 --> 02:21:51.046]  But at the same time, what's happening with the stock market could potentially panic people in terms of economic prospects, and that has its own kind of domino effect on the stock market and on the economy at large.
[02:21:51.046 --> 02:22:04.377]  What's your sense of what this whole coronavirus episode is about, and what effect it's going to have on the environment in which the American people are heading toward this very critical election in November?
[02:22:06.297 --> 02:22:07.098]  It's a great question.
[02:22:07.098 --> 02:22:10.380]  And Dr. Keyes, we've spoken about this on your program.
[02:22:10.380 --> 02:22:13.421]  But, you know, it's a direct answer to your question.
[02:22:13.421 --> 02:22:14.542]  Problem.
[02:22:14.542 --> 02:22:15.443]  Reaction.
[02:22:15.443 --> 02:22:16.043]  Solution.
[02:22:16.043 --> 02:22:17.124]  It's textbook.
[02:22:17.124 --> 02:22:17.544]  Create.
[02:22:17.544 --> 02:22:18.004]  They.
[02:22:18.004 --> 02:22:19.265]  You know, we know who they is.
[02:22:19.265 --> 02:22:20.826]  They create the problem.
[02:22:20.826 --> 02:22:21.266]  Right.
[02:22:21.266 --> 02:22:21.987]  Coronavirus.
[02:22:21.987 --> 02:22:23.447]  They anticipate the action.
[02:22:23.447 --> 02:22:24.048]  Reaction.
[02:22:24.048 --> 02:22:24.248]  Fear.
[02:22:24.944 --> 02:22:26.445]  And then the solution is what?
[02:22:26.445 --> 02:22:28.605]  Well, vaccinations, right?
[02:22:28.605 --> 02:22:30.586]  And all these other control mechanisms.
[02:22:30.586 --> 02:22:31.787]  Now, they're hitting the economy.
[02:22:31.787 --> 02:22:36.248]  My point on the economy is, yes, I mean, look, the Dow dropped 2000 points.
[02:22:36.248 --> 02:22:37.369]  It's up a bit today.
[02:22:37.369 --> 02:22:38.569]  We'll see what happens.
[02:22:38.569 --> 02:22:42.771]  But this isn't over because supply chains, as we know, have been disrupted.
[02:22:43.431 --> 02:22:48.837]  Because the factory workers aren't working in China and so forth and this is a global issue because we're globally connected.
[02:22:48.837 --> 02:22:53.561]  Another reason why we want to make our own goods here and sell them, but that's a different subject.
[02:22:53.561 --> 02:23:07.274]  But look, we... Well, you know, on that though, before you go ahead, I noticed a couple of articles where people were talking about the fact that because we have had this exchange, shall we say, with the Chinese on trade,
[02:23:08.671 --> 02:23:20.578]  And there had been sanctions, there had been their reaction, and people were all kind of looking warily at what might very well be a disruption of the supply chains.
[02:23:20.578 --> 02:23:33.785]  Don't you think that all of that happening over the course of several months, people were already thinking ahead to discount the possibility that we were going to have to deal with these supply chain disruptions with China?
[02:23:36.414 --> 02:23:42.380]  Well, yes, but there's going to be a delay, you know, from from lack of production and export and so on.
[02:23:42.380 --> 02:23:44.082]  I think there's going to be some issues.
[02:23:44.082 --> 02:23:54.672]  And look, a lot of people speculated this may be their final way to help take to potentially derail Trump's electability by taking the markets down.
[02:23:55.525 --> 02:23:57.066]  But Trump does seem to have a magic wand.
[02:23:57.066 --> 02:23:58.947]  I think we'll work our way out of this.
[02:23:58.947 --> 02:24:02.830]  But, you know, we just saw the Dow drop 2,000 points.
[02:24:02.830 --> 02:24:11.295]  I think what they're doing right now is they're scaring the hell out of Americans because right now, obviously, the travel industry has been hit very hard.
[02:24:11.295 --> 02:24:13.416]  Other sectors have been hit hard.
[02:24:13.416 --> 02:24:19.360]  But if they get us to the point of fear where people don't just live their life the way they do, that's how you really take the economy down.
[02:24:19.360 --> 02:24:20.360]  People don't go to movies.
[02:24:20.360 --> 02:24:21.661]  People don't go to conventions.
[02:24:21.661 --> 02:24:23.322]  People don't go out and spend money in malls.
[02:24:23.622 --> 02:24:27.203]  And that's a problem, and I think the President may very well address this this evening.
[02:24:27.203 --> 02:24:35.405]  But, you know, so they're very smart, they're very evil, and they know that we're coming after them, and that's why they're ramping up their efforts.
[02:24:35.405 --> 02:24:39.146]  This is evil rearing its ugly, ugly face.
[02:24:39.146 --> 02:24:44.168]  I think there could be, underlying it all though, a positive note.
[02:24:44.168 --> 02:24:47.889]  Because I have been watching with some concern, and it's over years now,
[02:24:48.946 --> 02:25:06.415]  That more and more, giving the head to, whether it's the technical companies or other companies, investing themselves in the Chinese economy in various ways, and becoming increasingly dependent.
[02:25:07.569 --> 02:25:26.194]  I think that this whole business, whether it's the discussion over trade and President Trump's determined effort to get fairness for us in terms of that trade relationship, or this little warning that we're getting, which could turn into a more serious warning, that we can't afford to become a nation.
[02:25:26.914 --> 02:25:33.316]  That is dependent on others in these critical respects and we don't have to.
[02:25:33.316 --> 02:25:53.443]  And don't you think that's actually a kind of silver lining in this cloud if people really start thinking about the fact that we need to remain a people that has both our own productive capacities but also has diversified our sources and resources in a way that helps to keep our economy healthy?
[02:25:55.296 --> 02:25:56.476]  Yeah, these are great points.
[02:25:56.476 --> 02:25:58.597]  And there's this additional silver linings in there.
[02:25:58.597 --> 02:26:03.539]  Just like we look back on everything, the Kavanaugh thing imploded, the Mueller witch hunt imploded.
[02:26:03.539 --> 02:26:06.540]  Then they brought out Mueller look like from his casket to try and salvage it.
[02:26:06.540 --> 02:26:07.200]  And that imploded.
[02:26:07.200 --> 02:26:11.341]  Then they had the impeachment hoax and Stormy Daniels and Avenatti and so forth and so on.
[02:26:11.341 --> 02:26:16.963]  This is going to backfire, too, to the point that you've just made, making the point, come back home and manufacture here.
[02:26:16.963 --> 02:26:17.463]  Number one.
[02:26:17.463 --> 02:26:21.525]  Number two, I mean, you can go you can go on and on with the benefits.
[02:26:21.525 --> 02:26:22.385]  Here's another benefit.
[02:26:23.407 --> 02:26:25.850]  The Federal Reserve is lowering rates.
[02:26:25.850 --> 02:26:27.731]  Isn't that what Trump's been asking the Fed to do?
[02:26:27.731 --> 02:26:38.081]  He's been asking the Fed to do that to keep his economy going, playing their rigged system against them to make sure that the economy, the markets stay intact for the electability.
[02:26:38.081 --> 02:26:46.128]  But come 2020, after the 2020 landslide by President Trump, the global financial reset is going to really accelerate.
[02:26:47.150 --> 02:26:53.132]  Taking the power away from the central bank monetary system and returning it back to we, the people.
[02:26:53.132 --> 02:26:55.932]  And this is playing right into that, just the same.
[02:26:55.932 --> 02:26:58.013]  But listen, no pain, no gain.
[02:26:58.013 --> 02:27:02.654]  And we certainly didn't, I didn't expect this, of course, but most of us didn't, this coronavirus thing to hit.
[02:27:02.654 --> 02:27:10.056]  Although there was a book written back in 1981, if I got the author, that commented very specifically about what's happening right now in a novel.
[02:27:10.056 --> 02:27:11.036]  But I'm all for it.
[02:27:12.145 --> 02:27:20.894]  Myself, that we can look forward to a talk tonight from President Trump that's going to accentuate the positive.
[02:27:20.894 --> 02:27:27.341]  Because I think that that's not only essential at the moment, but it's a reflection of our real and actual potential.
[02:27:27.341 --> 02:27:33.568]  So long as we react with prudence and with the kind of common sense
[02:27:34.088 --> 02:27:38.733]  That Americans are certainly still capable of showing to everything that's now happening in the world.
[02:27:38.733 --> 02:27:54.128]  And I think that everything that's going on, Alex Jones and people trying, in spite of China's reluctance, in spite of the overall reluctance now of the whole health sector to be honest about what's going on, I think that that's the key to the kind of reaction we need.
[02:27:54.508 --> 02:28:13.691]  Well, I would love it if President Trump tonight was up to speed and was to announce that there's an inexpensive product that's going to be talked about tomorrow on Alex Jones that will explain to everybody how you can make in your own little kitchen what you need to kill the corona thing and not even have to worry.
[02:28:13.691 --> 02:28:15.972]  But I don't expect him to know that tonight.
[02:28:15.972 --> 02:28:20.433]  Maybe he'll do another thing tomorrow night and explain that after he watches Alex Jones tomorrow.
[02:28:20.433 --> 02:28:21.833]  Well, that's a great teaser for our show.
[02:28:25.016 --> 02:28:31.063]  So, anyway, I think that we are in the midst of a time that is that combination.
[02:28:31.063 --> 02:28:37.331]  Bad guys are at work, but very often America has reacted to pressure, existential pressure.
[02:28:37.871 --> 02:28:50.381]  In a way that shows, whether it's wars or peace or economic development, that once you give the American people the right information and give them their head, we're more than capable of coping with the circumstances.
[02:28:50.381 --> 02:28:52.302]  And we will again.
[02:28:52.302 --> 02:28:52.823]  More of that...
[02:28:53.945 --> 02:28:56.586]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners.
[02:28:56.586 --> 02:29:05.130]  If you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system, but were waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[02:29:05.130 --> 02:29:14.435]  Bill Hyde here and I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's gonna let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[02:29:14.435 --> 02:29:19.497]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the East Bank of the Mississippi.
[02:29:19.717 --> 02:29:23.940]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location.
[02:29:23.940 --> 02:29:31.905]  And rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[02:29:31.905 --> 02:29:33.166]  So here's what you should do right now.
[02:29:33.166 --> 02:29:35.147]  Check out the PPX microgrid system
[02:29:35.307 --> 02:29:35.888]  That's right.
[02:29:55.856 --> 02:29:56.637]  Real stuff, man.
[02:29:56.637 --> 02:29:57.798]  We're talking about the real deal here.
[02:29:57.798 --> 02:30:03.263]  And I love Trump all day long, but man, I tell you, he sits there and lets these big tech people keep running roughshod over him.
[02:30:03.263 --> 02:30:06.126]  Everybody, I mean, I've got a problem.
[02:30:06.126 --> 02:30:07.848]  And we'll just take the Trump rallies over.
[02:30:07.848 --> 02:30:11.071]  That said, about two months ago, I came up with a plan that I haven't launched yet.
[02:30:11.611 --> 02:30:15.474]  We have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers.
[02:30:15.474 --> 02:30:16.715]  20 different stickers.
[02:30:16.715 --> 02:30:18.336]  Impeach the Democrats.
[02:30:18.336 --> 02:30:19.416]  Save the Second Amendment.
[02:30:19.416 --> 02:30:20.497]  Defend the First Amendment.
[02:30:20.497 --> 02:30:21.838]  Infowars.com.
[02:30:21.838 --> 02:30:24.000]  And it looks like duct tape, but it's just a regular sticker.
[02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:28.743]  You put it over your mouth, you go to a Trump rally, and you instantly take over without even disrupting things.
[02:30:28.743 --> 02:30:30.364]  People say, why are you doing this?
[02:30:30.364 --> 02:30:30.884]  What's happening?
[02:30:30.884 --> 02:30:34.667]  Well, you go, well, we're being censored, and, you know, Trump won't do anything about it.
[02:30:34.667 --> 02:30:37.789]  And Dr. Pucinich, let me just ask you what you think, because I've not launched this yet.
[02:30:38.029 --> 02:30:38.790]  Brilliant.
[02:30:38.790 --> 02:30:45.899]  You've taken the very element that they try to repress you with, that silence, and made it into a weapon.
[02:30:45.899 --> 02:30:48.843]  You have the loudest sound of all, silence.
[02:30:48.843 --> 02:30:51.667]  And you know what's most disturbing to people?
[02:30:51.667 --> 02:30:52.508]  Silence.
[02:30:54.887 --> 02:30:57.490]  Alex Jones here with two big announcements.
[02:30:57.490 --> 02:31:04.478]  Ultra 12 and Vitamin Mineral Fusion are both back in stock after being sold out for months.
[02:31:04.478 --> 02:31:14.930]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion is high quality vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and other key cofactors that are so good for you and your family, especially your children's bodies and your immune systems.
[02:31:15.370 --> 02:31:21.634]  Ultra 12 is the highest quality vitamin B12 taken sublingually under the tongue.
[02:31:21.634 --> 02:31:22.615]  It is back in stock.
[02:31:22.615 --> 02:31:31.841]  You can get them both individually for 40% off right now and get them together as a combo for 50% off.
[02:31:31.841 --> 02:31:39.285]  This makes your life so much better when you have a good multivitamin mineral that you actually absorb and as a tasty fruit punch.
[02:31:39.285 --> 02:31:39.746]  And of course,
[02:31:40.586 --> 02:31:47.332]  Platinum Me 12 is the bedrock foundation of energy, stamina, libido, just everything.
[02:31:47.332 --> 02:31:48.533]  And they're both back in stock.
[02:31:48.533 --> 02:31:54.898]  40% off individually or 50% off when you get them together at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:31:54.898 --> 02:31:59.842]  I don't sell firearms, but I promote them constantly.
[02:32:00.422 --> 02:32:03.846]  Now, could somebody listen to me and go out and buy a gun and use it wrong?
[02:32:03.846 --> 02:32:04.427]  Yeah.
[02:32:04.427 --> 02:32:06.128]  Just like I'm telling people, hey, I'm a man.
[02:32:06.128 --> 02:32:06.989]  I love women.
[02:32:06.989 --> 02:32:08.611]  You ought to go out and get a girlfriend.
[02:32:08.611 --> 02:32:09.993]  You may have problems with her.
[02:32:09.993 --> 02:32:11.254]  You may get a divorce.
[02:32:11.254 --> 02:32:11.875]  You may whatever.
[02:32:11.875 --> 02:32:16.620]  The point is, I'm just steering you in the direction I went that was successful and I loved.
[02:32:16.900 --> 02:32:30.815]  Well, when it comes to supplements and when it comes to storable foods, we've got the best out there because I want you to get a great result and to come back again and again as a customer and fund our political, spiritual operations against the law.
[02:32:30.815 --> 02:32:35.681]  So if you want storable foods and everybody else is sold out, and you want them delivered to your door, you want them to be high quality,
[02:32:36.041 --> 02:32:38.263]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:14.970 --> 02:33:21.196]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:32.688 --> 02:33:32.948]  Yes, sir.
[02:33:57.350 --> 02:34:02.774]  We didn't want to have a sponsor that just sells to government every time there's a crisis so that you get your food from the government.
[02:34:02.774 --> 02:34:04.735]  We wanted to have it directly to the people.
[02:34:04.735 --> 02:34:06.456]  My Patriot's been around 12 years.
[02:34:06.456 --> 02:34:07.657]  We've been with them 11.
[02:34:07.657 --> 02:34:14.821]  They've been partners for us, partners with us for about five or six years where they actually run our shopping cart, the area that takes the orders, so that you get fastest delivery.
[02:34:14.821 --> 02:34:21.746]  And it's just amazing to know that the general public, as Mike Adams said a few days ago, is now going out and buying storable food.
[02:34:21.786 --> 02:34:22.126]  I think.
[02:34:38.766 --> 02:34:38.986]  I think?
[02:34:53.487 --> 02:34:56.288]  Globalist judge that got caught rigging the Stone Jury.
[02:34:56.288 --> 02:35:01.089]  You see us putting on a big event, sponsoring an event here at the AMI tonight.
[02:35:01.089 --> 02:35:06.830]  Free to the public, an emergency summit on the First Amendment and how to save free expression, an emergency message to President Trump.
[02:35:06.830 --> 02:35:09.190]  I'm going to be bullhorning at the White House again.
[02:35:09.190 --> 02:35:11.011]  It's all about leadership.
[02:35:11.011 --> 02:35:14.671]  And the only way we can engage in leadership is your funding of this show.
[02:35:14.671 --> 02:35:20.413]  And you do that by buying the high quality, affordable food that you and your family already need at infomorestore.com today and locking it in.
[02:35:20.413 --> 02:35:22.413]  Because next week, some of the food prices
[02:35:23.373 --> 02:35:28.257]  Some of the number 10 cans are gonna have to go up, maybe even others, because it's just going up exponentially.
[02:35:28.257 --> 02:35:35.081]  Get your orders in now at infowarestore.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:35:35.081 --> 02:35:38.324]  But as of this Wednesday, live show, it is four weeks for delivery.
[02:35:38.324 --> 02:35:40.345]  They have the food on hand, but they've got to package it.
[02:35:40.345 --> 02:35:43.187]  They've got now four factories going 24 hours a day.
[02:35:43.187 --> 02:35:44.528]  They're trying to get a fifth factory.
[02:35:44.588 --> 02:35:48.010]  They're taking all their money and putting it forward to buy even more food into the future.
[02:35:48.010 --> 02:35:49.631]  I told him a month ago, I said, just keep buying.
[02:35:49.631 --> 02:35:50.692]  My gut says this is big.
[02:35:50.692 --> 02:35:52.473]  It's not a gamble for you to spend all your reserves.
[02:35:52.473 --> 02:35:53.474]  Just keep buying.
[02:35:53.474 --> 02:35:54.315]  And they did.
[02:35:54.315 --> 02:35:55.195]  So they have food.
[02:35:55.195 --> 02:35:59.838]  Others sell out, hold the money because they're not in this business for the reasons we are.
[02:35:59.838 --> 02:36:03.401]  We're in this to promote freedom and to be prepared and to be self-sufficient.
[02:36:04.056 --> 02:36:05.358]  InfoWarsStore.com.

[02:36:16.170 --> 02:36:19.353]  So many other great products now back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:36:27.248 --> 02:36:28.148]  Welcome back.
[02:36:28.148 --> 02:36:37.150]  We have been talking in the course of our recent discussion about this whole coronavirus environment and what it portends.
[02:36:37.150 --> 02:36:53.273]  I was reading an article about a US health official who has been telling Americans that they should, and I'm reading now, should prepare for community spread of the new coronavirus
[02:36:54.031 --> 02:37:02.422]  With families sitting down and explaining that there could very well be a rapid, sudden increase in the number of patients.
[02:37:02.422 --> 02:37:03.123]  A top U.S.
[02:37:03.123 --> 02:37:07.970]  health official has said this, but it would have been yesterday.
[02:37:07.970 --> 02:37:10.113]  In an escalation from previous warnings,
[02:37:11.345 --> 02:37:30.619]  Dr. Nancy Messonnier, Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said Americans should prepare for their lives to be disrupted by the spread of the new virus, including closure of schools and businesses.
[02:37:32.509 --> 02:37:40.974]  And from what I've been hearing here on Mike Adams Show and other places, this is an interesting, almost a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy.
[02:37:40.974 --> 02:37:44.395]  That's the problem with dealing with government these days, isn't it?
[02:37:44.395 --> 02:37:56.382]  Because when they tell you something's going to happen, it used to be the case that this is because it was an emergency, it's an event that's happening, it's happening to us, and then we're going to be controlling it, doing our level best to deal with it, and so forth and so on.
[02:37:56.382 --> 02:37:59.423]  And then when you start to look now behind the scenes, what's going on?
[02:37:59.423 --> 02:38:00.804]  Well, part of the reason
[02:38:01.284 --> 02:38:15.055]  That it may be a sudden outbreak is because they actually haven't been doing everything they need to be doing to make sure we're testing and quarantining in the way that we might do to avoid this kind of bloom, right?
[02:38:15.055 --> 02:38:19.359]  So that it comes up all of a sudden and then we all have to deal with it, etc.
[02:38:19.359 --> 02:38:25.784]  Now, it's nice that we're getting this warning, but it implies something that goes beyond the coronavirus.
[02:38:25.784 --> 02:38:29.427]  And yet, we live in a time when we're not being prepared for this at all.
[02:38:31.080 --> 02:38:37.705]  What she's saying has a lot to do with how you're going to take responsibility for yourself.
[02:38:37.705 --> 02:38:41.368]  Everything about the present juncture, including what's going on in our politics.
[02:38:41.368 --> 02:38:55.680]  All these people coming forward saying socialism, government's going to take care of it, government will take care of your education, government will take care of your kids, government will even take care of your kids behind your back so that they know stuff that you don't want them to know about sex and everything else.
[02:38:55.680 --> 02:38:58.583]  They're taking away the initiative from the American people.
[02:38:59.247 --> 02:39:07.936]  At the same time that one could argue they're helping to set the stage for a crisis that requires what?
[02:39:07.936 --> 02:39:11.379]  That you take the initiative in taking care of yourself.
[02:39:11.379 --> 02:39:15.583]  That you take the initiative in dealing with the situation that's going on.
[02:39:15.583 --> 02:39:18.546]  You think is that going to really work?
[02:39:18.546 --> 02:39:21.989]  Why are they doing these contradictory things?
[02:39:21.989 --> 02:39:23.771]  I think we need to be thinking this through.
[02:39:24.426 --> 02:39:35.837]  Because the challenge that's involved here goes beyond health and has to do with the mentality that is now being encouraged in the population of the United States.
[02:39:35.837 --> 02:39:41.642]  A kind of passive, government's going to do it for you mentality, going hand in hand.
[02:39:41.642 --> 02:39:44.165]  And I remember, I've heard people talk about this Bob.
[02:39:44.898 --> 02:39:47.600]  And they say that, you know what's needed in this country?
[02:39:47.600 --> 02:39:48.901]  We need a crisis!
[02:39:48.901 --> 02:39:52.723]  We need a crisis so that Americans will wake up and do this and do that and the other thing.
[02:39:52.723 --> 02:39:54.425]  And it looks like they're putting one together.
[02:39:54.425 --> 02:39:58.047]  Am I wrong, John?
[02:39:58.047 --> 02:40:00.329]  Problem, reaction, solution.
[02:40:00.329 --> 02:40:01.870]  False flag season.
[02:40:01.870 --> 02:40:03.591]  Trump's about to win another election.
[02:40:04.709 --> 02:40:07.030]  Well, I'm not talking about Trump winning now.
[02:40:07.030 --> 02:40:09.771]  We're going to get off the topic of Trump winning or losing.
[02:40:09.771 --> 02:40:17.695]  Because at some point, Americans need to remember that what's really important in this country is whether we are winning or losing our country.
[02:40:17.695 --> 02:40:22.937]  After Trump is no longer president, there's still going to be a challenge to our posterity.
[02:40:22.937 --> 02:40:30.160]  And that challenge is supposed to be government of, by, and for the people, sustained through our constitutional system.
[02:40:30.160 --> 02:40:31.481]  Can a passive people,
[02:40:32.768 --> 02:40:48.160]  Regimented to believe that the government takes the initiative, and you do what they tell you, and the government takes the initiative, and they give you your education, the government takes the initiative, they create your future, and the government takes the initiative, and they take care of your children, and they educate your children, and they take care of your family.
[02:40:48.160 --> 02:40:53.144]  Are we going to be a free people when they get done with all of this?
[02:40:53.144 --> 02:40:54.506]  I wonder.
[02:40:54.506 --> 02:41:00.811]  Because I think the real challenge is, are we accepting the challenge of taking responsibility for ourselves?
[02:41:00.811 --> 02:41:01.231]  What do you think?
[02:41:02.580 --> 02:41:06.204]  Well, I think it ties right hand in hand to your point.
[02:41:06.204 --> 02:41:09.026]  I think your point is well taken and critical.
[02:41:09.026 --> 02:41:12.470]  It goes when you look at the freak show we just saw the other night with a bunch of bees.
[02:41:12.470 --> 02:41:17.394]  We had Buttigieg and Biden and Bernie and Bloomberg, a whole lot of bees up there.
[02:41:17.394 --> 02:41:19.256]  That's what they want.
[02:41:19.256 --> 02:41:20.598]  What they don't want are free
[02:41:21.298 --> 02:41:27.480]  People, critical thinking people that take responsibility of themselves and their lives and their communities and so forth.
[02:41:27.480 --> 02:41:30.761]  So they've got this whole platform to say, well, come over here.
[02:41:30.761 --> 02:41:32.401]  You know, we're going to take care of everything.
[02:41:32.401 --> 02:41:34.422]  It's the big government plan, as you well know.
[02:41:34.422 --> 02:41:36.683]  And it's backfiring.
[02:41:36.683 --> 02:41:40.864]  I think the point you're raising is something that's going to take some time.
[02:41:40.864 --> 02:41:43.285]  And Life After Trump should be the title of my next book.
[02:41:44.865 --> 02:41:49.407]  But you know, I would like to get this in if I can real quick, because this is the biggest news story that didn't make the news.
[02:41:49.407 --> 02:41:50.567]  May 24th, 2019.
[02:41:50.567 --> 02:41:55.769]  And it's pertinent to right where we're heading today and immediate tomorrows before us.
[02:41:55.769 --> 02:41:59.350]  The biggest news story is Constitution State's
[02:42:00.074 --> 02:42:03.175]  That the punishment for treason is execution.
[02:42:03.175 --> 02:42:06.797]  A reporter asked this to the president at the agriculture briefing.
[02:42:06.797 --> 02:42:11.039]  And he said, you, sir, have accused your adversaries of treason.
[02:42:11.039 --> 02:42:12.020]  Do you care to name them?
[02:42:12.020 --> 02:42:13.000]  And Trump said, sure.
[02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:18.763]  You have to look at Comey, Stroke, Page, McCabe, Clapper, and others much higher up than that.
[02:42:18.763 --> 02:42:25.666]  This is the president talking about treason, naming people in the Department of Justice and the FBI, and citing the Constitution.
[02:42:25.666 --> 02:42:27.087]  And that's why those thoughts are connected.
[02:42:29.168 --> 02:42:31.571]  I think we can get into a discussion of that.
[02:42:31.571 --> 02:42:34.994]  I think it's a fairly complex point.
[02:42:34.994 --> 02:42:41.280]  And it has to do with my neuralgia about talking about purges and doing other things like this.
[02:42:41.280 --> 02:42:42.602]  But we can get into that.
[02:42:42.602 --> 02:42:46.686]  I really want to drill down on it a little bit when we get back from this message.
[02:42:53.812 --> 02:42:54.973]  Don't be a victim.
[02:42:54.973 --> 02:42:59.835]  If you're worried about the coronavirus, exercise, but not too hard because that can lower your immune system.
[02:42:59.835 --> 02:43:04.117]  Drink extra purified clean water so that no toxins weigh you down, but you have plenty of hydration.
[02:43:04.117 --> 02:43:06.519]  Prayer and meditation has been proven to make you healthier.
[02:43:06.519 --> 02:43:09.980]  Get plenty of vitamin C. Get plenty of vitamin D3, which is fish oil.
[02:43:09.980 --> 02:43:11.641]  Take your colloidal silver, all of it.
[02:43:11.641 --> 02:43:15.263]  That's what allows you to be healthier and get plenty of sleep.
[02:43:15.263 --> 02:43:18.865]  We have sold out of the 16-ounce immune gargle that has the nano-silicon
[02:43:18.965 --> 02:43:19.945]  We're good to go.
[02:43:35.051 --> 02:43:38.055]  We also have the super silver in our whitening toothpaste.
[02:43:38.055 --> 02:43:43.021]  Again, we're the only folks allowed to private label or make our own products with this top nanotech company based here in the U.S.
[02:43:43.021 --> 02:43:46.486]  that's in all these Homeland Security documents and everything, because we get the best stuff.
[02:43:46.486 --> 02:43:47.707]  There's a lot of patriots.
[02:43:47.707 --> 02:43:49.309]  There's not just bad guys coming after us.
[02:43:49.309 --> 02:43:52.313]  There's a flip side of all the good guys and good gals.
[02:43:52.313 --> 02:43:53.054]  It's very exciting.
[02:43:54.321 --> 02:44:02.504]  It's wonderful that so many people are now thinking about preparedness, and that we're seeing record food sales, not just here, but across the world.
[02:44:02.504 --> 02:44:03.084]  That's good.
[02:44:03.084 --> 02:44:05.464]  People need to be self-sufficient.
[02:44:05.464 --> 02:44:12.467]  The average person is living hand-to-mouth, paycheck-to-paycheck, and doesn't even know how to change their tire.
[02:44:12.467 --> 02:44:16.128]  We need to reverse this trend and start getting prepared.
[02:44:16.128 --> 02:44:23.090]  And that means even with just the basics, even a three-week food supply that you know is always there, that you only go to in emergencies.
[02:44:23.710 --> 02:44:28.914]  That said, boosting your immune system is just as critical, or even more so.
[02:44:28.914 --> 02:44:37.199]  And things like DNA Force Plus, that's now back in stock, is so good for your cells, your mitochondria, your telomeres, the engine of your body.
[02:44:37.199 --> 02:44:46.605]  It's back in stock, 40% off right now, along with Ultra 12, and along with Vitamin Mineral Fusion, and a bunch of other great products that are finally back in stock.

[02:44:52.249 --> 02:44:52.669]  A total 360 win.
[02:44:55.155 --> 02:45:00.610]  A lot of people ask me the InfoWars secret and I'll just tell you, I'm just real.
[02:45:01.604 --> 02:45:06.548]  Now, the problem is, I go back and forth, though, in my mind about where I stand.
[02:45:06.548 --> 02:45:10.371]  I mean, on basic stuff, like the Second Amendment and family and God, I'm 100%.
[02:45:10.371 --> 02:45:14.274]  But you get to other issues, I start asking myself questions.
[02:45:14.274 --> 02:45:20.099]  So I'll just tell you, I feel really guilty during the middle of this crisis selling high-quality, storable food.
[02:45:20.099 --> 02:45:22.301]  Even though I was pre-positioned, I'm right.
[02:45:22.301 --> 02:45:23.642]  We were right about being man-made.
[02:45:23.642 --> 02:45:25.543]  We're right about it being super deadly.
[02:45:25.543 --> 02:45:26.724]  We're right about being prepared.
[02:45:26.724 --> 02:45:28.686]  It still feels weird to be right.
[02:45:29.417 --> 02:45:30.718]  Isn't that crazy?
[02:45:30.718 --> 02:45:31.499]  But you know what?
[02:45:31.499 --> 02:45:32.900]  I'm getting past that.
[02:45:32.900 --> 02:45:34.501]  We still have swearable food.
[02:45:34.501 --> 02:45:35.382]  We have plenty of it.
[02:45:35.382 --> 02:45:37.904]  The problem is the packaging of it and getting it out.
[02:45:37.904 --> 02:45:39.306]  Other competitors don't have it.
[02:45:39.306 --> 02:45:40.066]  They're lying to you.
[02:45:40.066 --> 02:45:45.311]  Get your orders at infowarsstore.com, and you know you're going to get high-quality, swearable food.
[02:45:45.311 --> 02:45:46.972]  But now it's not two weeks.
[02:45:46.972 --> 02:45:47.973]  It's four weeks, folks.
[02:45:47.973 --> 02:45:48.694]  We got the food.
[02:45:48.694 --> 02:45:49.875]  We got to package it.
[02:45:49.875 --> 02:45:53.778]  Get your food today, high-quality, and fund the InfoWar at infowarsstore.com.
[02:45:54.739 --> 02:46:01.388]  There's roughly only 260 days left until the 2020 election and already you've seen all sorts of crazy things happen.
[02:46:01.388 --> 02:46:12.002]  The globalists are trying to plunge the economy, they're trying to start wars, they're trying to overthrow the president, they're trying to silence free speech, they're trying to trigger riots in the streets, but everything they do is blowing up in the
[02:46:12.482 --> 02:46:21.806]  We the people have to pray, stay focused, be involved, keep spreading the word, keep countering their lies, and we have to be prepared in case things go south.
[02:46:21.806 --> 02:46:33.892]  That's why it's so critical to go to InfoWareStore.com and stock up on high-quality preparedness items from storable foods, high-quality water filtration, air filtration, to the very best supplements and silver products you're going to find.
[02:46:33.892 --> 02:46:34.872]  They're all available at
[02:46:35.092 --> 02:46:36.793]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:13.570 --> 02:47:20.815]  Well, I want to give John, uh, John, I want to give you a chance to, uh, finish the point that you were making when we were, uh, at the break.
[02:47:20.815 --> 02:47:24.258]  Because I think it was a, well, it was a critical one.
[02:47:24.258 --> 02:47:25.779]  Yeah.
[02:47:25.779 --> 02:47:26.799]  Thank you, Dr. Keyes.
[02:47:26.799 --> 02:47:28.040]  It's great to be with you.
[02:47:28.040 --> 02:47:33.124]  Um, yeah, again, the president was at a live briefing and a reporter figured he would sandbag the president.
[02:47:33.124 --> 02:47:33.344]  He said,
[02:47:34.056 --> 02:47:38.279]  Sir, the Constitution states that punishment for treason is execution.
[02:47:38.279 --> 02:47:40.961]  Would you name your adversaries, and Trump went on to name them.
[02:47:40.961 --> 02:47:43.362]  Comey, Stroke, Page, McCabe.
[02:47:43.362 --> 02:47:46.404]  That's a pretty big deal, and I'll take it one step further.
[02:47:46.404 --> 02:47:48.686]  This is where we are, and this is where we're heading.
[02:47:48.686 --> 02:47:49.946]  The rule of law reset.
[02:47:49.946 --> 02:47:50.587]  You know, U.S.
[02:47:50.587 --> 02:47:51.267]  section codes 2384.
[02:47:52.788 --> 02:47:53.368]  We're good to go.
[02:48:15.945 --> 02:48:22.549]  Falsely reported information, thus aiding and abetting these failed coup d'etats.
[02:48:22.549 --> 02:48:28.133]  So this is a pretty big deal because seditious conspiracy and advocating the overthrow of government are not small issues.
[02:48:28.133 --> 02:48:30.875]  And lastly, John Kerry and Barack Obama.
[02:48:31.175 --> 02:48:34.436]  You want to talk about high crimes and misdemeanors?
[02:48:34.436 --> 02:48:37.658]  You want to talk about treasonous acts and violating the Logan Act?
[02:48:37.658 --> 02:48:42.540]  Well, you've got to look at the previous administration, and this will all come out in the Pfizer reports now.
[02:48:42.540 --> 02:48:53.785]  But what we're talking about here is the last failed coup was to try and bring Trump into war, but that backfired because of the intel we had, and we beat them to the punch.
[02:48:53.785 --> 02:48:56.406]  And so now we've got the coronavirus, sure.
[02:48:56.406 --> 02:48:57.247]  Let me ask a question.
[02:49:00.737 --> 02:49:04.978]  I think these are very serious charges.
[02:49:04.978 --> 02:49:06.979]  They're a very serious subject.
[02:49:06.979 --> 02:49:10.920]  And it's a subject that goes beyond politics.
[02:49:10.920 --> 02:49:14.001]  And it goes beyond individual wrongdoing.
[02:49:14.001 --> 02:49:18.742]  Because it has something to do with the culture of our self-government.
[02:49:18.742 --> 02:49:26.084]  One of the things I've liked about being American, and you notice that they're very careful in the Constitution, when they talk about
[02:49:27.449 --> 02:49:29.871]  Impeachment and removal, for instance.
[02:49:29.871 --> 02:49:38.255]  The penalties that are specified are penalties that have to do with being removed from office and having trust withdrawn from you by the American people.
[02:49:38.255 --> 02:49:41.477]  They haven't been applying that one, but I think they really ought to.
[02:49:41.477 --> 02:49:44.819]  Because once you've been in a breach of trust, it's a serious problem.
[02:49:44.819 --> 02:49:52.143]  But don't you think that when we're dealing with the issue of treason and the death penalty, what I don't want to see happen here, and I'll be frank with you, John,
[02:49:53.004 --> 02:49:55.765]  And it's why the word purge, I don't like it.
[02:49:55.765 --> 02:50:07.730]  It's all associated with the communist system in which disputes quickly become a subject of show trials in which you're going to be put to death.
[02:50:07.730 --> 02:50:11.391]  That's the French Revolution, it's not the American Revolution.
[02:50:11.391 --> 02:50:15.533]  That's the Russian Revolution, it's not the American Revolution.
[02:50:15.533 --> 02:50:21.555]  One of the things that I think has been an advantage for our politics is that we've been very careful
[02:50:22.426 --> 02:50:37.050]  To make sure that the political competition doesn't become a matter of life and death, because once it does, holding on to power becomes an imperative that people not only can't resist, they think their lives depend on it.
[02:50:37.050 --> 02:50:42.151]  Do you think it would be a little careless of us to be rushing into that kind of a political culture?
[02:50:42.151 --> 02:50:43.972]  Because I do.
[02:50:43.972 --> 02:50:48.033]  Well, I agree with your points and my comments are we're not rushing.
[02:50:48.033 --> 02:50:49.573]  That's what everyone wanted us to do.
[02:50:49.573 --> 02:50:50.794]  Why didn't you lock her up yet?
[02:50:50.794 --> 02:50:51.794]  Well, you know, timing.
[02:50:52.304 --> 02:50:53.604]  Timing is everything.
[02:50:53.604 --> 02:51:01.807]  And just because the Constitution states the punishment for treason is execution doesn't necessarily mean it will be carried out if one is guilty of that.
[02:51:01.807 --> 02:51:04.808]  But at least they will pay some price.
[02:51:04.808 --> 02:51:09.189]  And so your point is well taken and I completely agree.
[02:51:09.189 --> 02:51:14.231]  That would be a reasonable response to these guys because I always keep in mind two things.
[02:51:15.154 --> 02:51:20.885]  When they start poking and prodding on issues like this, it partly has to do with Donald Trump.
[02:51:20.885 --> 02:51:23.791]  It also partly has to do with what they are planning to do.
[02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:47.458]  See, when they talk socialism and communism, when Bernie Sanders shows all this admiration for Joseph Stalin and stuff, you know, part of what warns me against socialists, it's why I absolutely, you'd really have to convince me before I go with anybody who subscribes to that ideology, because it has always been an ideology of death and mass murder.
[02:51:48.445 --> 02:51:54.408]  Everywhere it gets total control, it's a life or death issue, politics.
[02:51:54.408 --> 02:52:07.655]  And if it gets into their hands, that power, it's French Revolution, off with their heads, streets running red with blood, people dying because they didn't tow the party line.
[02:52:07.655 --> 02:52:10.676]  I never want to see that culture in this country.
[02:52:10.676 --> 02:52:18.060]  And if we're getting to the point where our political competition becomes a matter of if you lose, you die,
[02:52:18.959 --> 02:52:26.863]  Then I think we're going to be in serious trouble as a people, and we should do everything as a self-conscious effort on the part of this people.
[02:52:26.863 --> 02:52:36.068]  Because at the end of the day, it's not a matter of these people fighting on their little elitist level to wipe each other out so they can get total control.
[02:52:36.068 --> 02:52:37.548]  We can't let it happen.
[02:52:37.548 --> 02:52:42.011]  Otherwise, the American people will no longer be in control.
[02:52:42.011 --> 02:52:43.131]  And that's a question, see?
[02:52:43.131 --> 02:52:44.632]  Because I think that right now,
[02:52:45.572 --> 02:52:49.273]  If you were to ask me, Alan, do you think that the American people are still in control of this country?
[02:52:49.273 --> 02:52:51.594]  I think that's what's hanging in the balance.
[02:52:51.594 --> 02:53:13.521]  That's why Nancy Pelosi doesn't want our elections to matter so much, and so forth and so on, because she wants us to live in a system where you've got the elitist faction in control, and the different sides of it compete with each other the way the old aristocrats used to, and the battlefield may be politics, and the buildings are left standing, but they're still out to do murder.
[02:53:14.361 --> 02:53:18.322]  And I don't think we want to take this country down that road.
[02:53:18.322 --> 02:53:21.363]  I don't think the founders envisaged it as such.
[02:53:21.363 --> 02:53:28.545]  So I think every time we use the word treason, we ought to be speaking with the most deep seriousness that we're capable of.
[02:53:28.545 --> 02:53:31.525]  And right now, I don't see it in our leadership in this country.
[02:53:31.525 --> 02:53:42.068]  I don't see that kind of serious regard for conscience, right and wrong, and the deep issues of justice that sustain self-government, not their pursuit of power.
[02:53:42.068 --> 02:53:42.508]  Am I wrong?
[02:53:44.642 --> 02:54:00.155]  Well, I think as the declass gets underway, the things we cited before, the things that are in fact actually happening now, because the pendulum has shifted, we're going to see these things overall that you're talking about start to play out in a positive way.
[02:54:00.155 --> 02:54:02.457]  But you've got, if you don't restore just
[02:54:03.132 --> 02:54:03.292]  Yes.
[02:54:20.218 --> 02:54:21.679]  It's a very clear, distinct thing.
[02:54:21.679 --> 02:54:25.883]  We are fighting a revolution.
[02:54:25.883 --> 02:54:28.004]  Trump is trying to resurrect America.
[02:54:28.004 --> 02:54:33.769]  This is a second revolution in America and it's being fought peacefully to an extent.
[02:54:33.769 --> 02:54:37.812]  But we have to win this because socialism and communism is where they are heading.
[02:54:37.812 --> 02:54:38.452]  They're not hiding.
[02:54:38.452 --> 02:54:39.693]  They're hidden in plain sight.
[02:54:39.693 --> 02:54:40.454]  They've de-cloaked.
[02:54:40.974 --> 02:54:45.676]  And look, as far as the candidates go, Biden is dead on arrival.
[02:54:45.676 --> 02:54:48.797]  The old guard, if you will, have used him, chewed him up and spit him out.
[02:54:48.797 --> 02:54:50.338]  He's finished.
[02:54:50.338 --> 02:54:53.919]  Buttigieg was, I believe, who they wanted, but he's not going to make it.
[02:54:53.919 --> 02:54:58.360]  Look, at the end of the day, Bernie Sanders is the only one that has a real movement.
[02:54:58.360 --> 02:55:00.841]  They don't want him in, so he isn't going to get it.
[02:55:00.841 --> 02:55:02.522]  In my opinion, just an opinion,
[02:55:03.294 --> 02:55:06.438]  I think you're going to seek Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama.
[02:55:06.438 --> 02:55:11.062]  There's a ticket that they're going to bring out on the 11th hour.
[02:55:11.062 --> 02:55:11.823]  And you know what?
[02:55:11.823 --> 02:55:21.133]  Bring that on because Hillary Clinton will be in the middle of indictments and I can't wait to see Trump on a debate stage unpack Michelle Obama's suitcase if you hear me loud and clear.
[02:55:21.133 --> 02:55:21.834]  Forget about it.
[02:55:21.834 --> 02:55:22.795]  No one's going to beat Trump.
[02:55:23.175 --> 02:55:30.926]  But it's a fascinating time to be alive, and it's capitalism and America and freedom or tyranny.
[02:55:30.926 --> 02:55:32.288]  That's where we're heading, folks.
[02:55:32.288 --> 02:55:35.372]  It's a clear decision in the 2020 election, in my opinion.
[02:55:36.311 --> 02:55:40.093]  Well, John, I tell you, man, I really appreciate you.
[02:55:40.093 --> 02:55:47.258]  You're always optimistic, and this reminds me a little bit, just a little bit, now don't get excited, of the Bible.
[02:55:47.258 --> 02:55:48.959]  There's prophecies in here.
[02:55:48.959 --> 02:55:49.880]  Yeah, I know.
[02:55:49.880 --> 02:55:50.860]  Isn't that exciting?
[02:55:50.860 --> 02:55:56.724]  There's prophecies in here that are now playing out, as if you were Ezekiel or Jeremiah or something.
[02:55:56.724 --> 02:55:57.905]  But this is exciting.
[02:55:57.905 --> 02:56:04.069]  You can get it from Defiance Press, or also johnmichaelchambers.com, and John Michael, it's
[02:56:04.369 --> 02:56:13.780]  Always a pleasure to be with you, and enjoy your optimism and your Q stuff, and let's hope that this all plays out the way you say.
[02:56:13.780 --> 02:56:20.568]  The only comparison that can be factually made between me and the Bible would be, I have the same initials, but that's about it.
[02:56:22.612 --> 02:56:23.413]  There you go!
[02:56:23.413 --> 02:56:24.233]  I love it!
[02:56:24.233 --> 02:56:25.854]  Thank you, man!
[02:56:25.854 --> 02:56:27.455]  Well, thank you, John, as always.
[02:56:27.455 --> 02:56:35.760]  I really appreciate it when you come on, and I hope that all of you who are watching, I know that the InfoWars audience, y'all are very thoughtful people.
[02:56:35.760 --> 02:56:41.504]  You are looking to feed your own capacity to reach a judgment.
[02:56:42.148 --> 02:56:46.911]  Based on information rather than having information withheld from you.
[02:56:46.911 --> 02:56:51.493]  And I'm glad to be a little part today of that effort to bring it to you.
[02:56:51.493 --> 02:57:01.458]  But also to spark your thinking because I think one of the things we're not encouraged to do anymore is remember that we're not just responsible for ourselves as citizens of the United States.
[02:57:01.458 --> 02:57:02.439]  You do realize that, right?
[02:57:03.103 --> 02:57:04.684]  They want us to think about ourselves.
[02:57:04.684 --> 02:57:05.504]  What are we getting?
[02:57:05.504 --> 02:57:06.865]  What have they done for you lately?
[02:57:06.865 --> 02:57:08.226]  How is your job going?
[02:57:08.226 --> 02:57:09.367]  What money are you making?
[02:57:09.367 --> 02:57:10.467]  How is your company doing?
[02:57:10.467 --> 02:57:12.128]  And so forth and so on.
[02:57:12.128 --> 02:57:25.156]  But when we participate in elections, when we make choices for the government of the United States, that's all about maintaining the sovereignty of the American people as implemented through the Constitution of the United States.
[02:57:25.908 --> 02:57:35.034]  We are making judgments that will, of course, affect our posterity and the future of the kind of liberty and self-government we've enjoyed.
[02:57:35.034 --> 02:57:44.600]  And I think that means that we have to always be thinking about our special responsibility to that future.
[02:57:44.600 --> 02:57:52.966]  I spend a lot of time reminding the InfoWars family of listeners and viewers that without you, we won't be on the air.
[02:57:52.966 --> 02:57:54.487]  And I spend a lot of time thanking you.
[02:57:55.270 --> 02:58:02.635]  But I really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really changing the world for the better and raising the alarm as modern Paul Revere's.
[02:58:02.635 --> 02:58:10.121]  But something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are really amazing.
[02:58:10.121 --> 02:58:18.947]  You've got that pledge from me, but you've seen the third party test out there, the air filtration, the water filtration, the supplements are all the very best you're going to find out there.
[02:58:18.947 --> 02:58:23.491]  And you can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalists.
[02:58:24.460 --> 02:58:25.000]  It's hard.
[02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:28.923]  So it's not a burden to support InfoWars.
[02:58:28.923 --> 02:58:39.549]  It really is something that is good for everybody, that stands for justice and freedom, and makes your life and your family's life and your children's life so much better.
[02:58:39.549 --> 02:58:42.211]  So visit InfoWarsStore.com today.
[02:58:45.276 --> 02:58:48.018]  There can no longer be any doubt.
[02:58:48.018 --> 02:58:52.000]  This coronavirus is serious on multiple levels.
[02:58:52.000 --> 02:58:53.300]  It's very communicable.
[02:58:53.300 --> 02:58:55.321]  It spreads very, very fast.
[02:58:55.321 --> 02:58:57.302]  It is killing a lot of people.
[02:58:57.302 --> 02:59:01.024]  And the Chinese Communist government has covered up just how bad it is.
[02:59:01.024 --> 02:59:03.946]  And the White House is now openly challenging them.
[02:59:03.946 --> 02:59:07.028]  So are Trump's top scientists, and so is Senator Cotton.
[02:59:07.848 --> 02:59:12.494]  My friends, now is the time to get prepared.
[02:59:12.494 --> 02:59:14.836]  2020 is not a year to play games with.
[02:59:14.836 --> 02:59:18.581]  The globalists are trying to create economic collapse, race riots.
[02:59:18.581 --> 02:59:21.484]  We don't know how bad this virus is going to get here.
[02:59:21.484 --> 02:59:25.028]  That's why listeners to InfoWars need to be prepared.
[02:59:25.028 --> 02:59:28.472]  InfoWarsStore.com has the products that make
[02:59:28.752 --> 02:59:30.713]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:01.758 --> 03:00:26.590]  I'm Alan Keyes, this is InfoWars, and right now I want to take us into some areas that deal with what I introduced yesterday, because it's always on my mind, and even as we're having our discussions here, you may have noticed I try to, whenever I can, bring things back so that we're not just talking about this issue or that issue, we are talking about the issue.
[03:00:26.590 --> 03:00:27.571]  And what is the issue?
[03:00:28.705 --> 03:00:31.387]  Even if you say we're at war, right?
[03:00:31.387 --> 03:00:34.008]  People usually go to war to defend things.
[03:00:34.008 --> 03:00:34.949]  At least decent people.
[03:00:34.949 --> 03:00:37.651]  You don't go to war to take stuff from folks.
[03:00:37.651 --> 03:00:41.213]  You don't go to war to get vengeance and all of these kinds of things.
[03:00:41.213 --> 03:00:43.574]  That's possible, but you don't really.
[03:00:43.574 --> 03:00:49.918]  Decent people only go to war in order to defend that which is most precious to their lives.
[03:00:49.918 --> 03:00:55.221]  Because war involves, when you're dealing with it in the way it has been dealt with historically, going out there to kill people.
[03:00:56.697 --> 03:01:03.203]  One of the problems is we've become all together too nonchalant these days about what it means to kill other people.
[03:01:03.203 --> 03:01:04.804]  To kill innocent folks.
[03:01:04.804 --> 03:01:06.966]  People who have done us no harm.
[03:01:06.966 --> 03:01:09.108]  You don't kill them, generally speaking.
[03:01:09.108 --> 03:01:10.029]  You don't want to kill them.
[03:01:10.029 --> 03:01:11.830]  You don't get involved in killing them.
[03:01:11.830 --> 03:01:17.575]  And wars that are started with a view to taking something from somebody else by killing innocent folks.
[03:01:17.575 --> 03:01:22.940]  Americans have always, pretty much as a people now, reacted to such wars as wrong.
[03:01:23.928 --> 03:01:26.309]  That doesn't mean we haven't been engaged in them.
[03:01:26.309 --> 03:01:34.834]  But usually, you can't keep the American people involved in a war once they realize, oh my gosh, we're doing what the bad guys do.
[03:01:34.834 --> 03:01:36.275]  We don't want to do this.
[03:01:36.275 --> 03:01:44.719]  And that means that something we're trying to preserve, something we're fighting for, goes beyond the issues they usually talk to us about.
[03:01:44.719 --> 03:01:48.722]  It's not just about how much money's in your pocket, how prosperous you're going to be.
[03:01:48.722 --> 03:01:50.703]  I think, and I hope and pray,
[03:01:51.479 --> 03:02:13.633]  That it is still the case that if we have a choice between damaging our pocketbooks and losing our conscience, which is necessary to sustain our understanding of rights and everything else we hold dear and precious about this nation's opportunity for self-government, I still hope we're the sort of people who will choose conscience over convenience.
[03:02:13.633 --> 03:02:14.653]  But I don't know.
[03:02:14.653 --> 03:02:15.474]  And you know why I don't know?
[03:02:16.354 --> 03:02:20.957]  I don't know, because everything that's going on seems to militate against that now.
[03:02:20.957 --> 03:02:35.887]  And people don't see the connection sometimes, but the issues that we're being challenged with, particularly issues like what we're doing in terms of the education of our kids, what are we doing with issues of conscience that have to do with taking innocent life.
[03:02:36.474 --> 03:02:38.354]  People always say, well it's the abortion issue.
[03:02:38.354 --> 03:02:42.915]  I'll be talking about an issue like that when we get back and getting a little more deeply into it.
[03:02:42.915 --> 03:02:53.978]  There's been a bill before the Congress and the big debate between the Senators is, is this an issue that involves abortion or is this an issue that involves taking life?
[03:02:53.978 --> 03:02:58.239]  And I'm thinking to myself, what if we get off making a distinction like that?
[03:02:58.239 --> 03:02:59.579]  What does this mean?
[03:02:59.579 --> 03:03:03.480]  When folks can actually think they're having a debate that doesn't miss the point.
[03:03:04.099 --> 03:03:06.041]  When they make that contrast.
[03:03:06.041 --> 03:03:23.734]  And when I'm watching young people in one interview I saw recently, who are being asked what they think about abortion, and their response has all to do with whether or not the particular individual woman is getting what she wants, doing what she wants, getting her choice.
[03:03:23.734 --> 03:03:25.395]  No longer even a thought
[03:03:26.005 --> 03:03:29.428]  About whether or not a life is being taken that shouldn't be taken.
[03:03:29.428 --> 03:03:36.294]  Whether there's a rubric for that that goes beyond the way we feel, our convenience, what's going to happen to us.
[03:03:36.294 --> 03:03:46.423]  And that really has to do with our fundamental claim to be a way of life that is based on respect for God-endowed rights.
[03:03:46.423 --> 03:03:49.066]  Now that word rights, I know, they've really fooled us.
[03:03:50.106 --> 03:03:54.567]  They fooled us by getting us to believe that that word right equals freedom.
[03:03:54.567 --> 03:03:56.668]  Does that word right equal freedom?
[03:03:56.668 --> 03:03:58.109]  And why don't we call it freedom all the time?
[03:03:58.109 --> 03:03:58.869]  Why do we call it right?
[03:03:58.869 --> 03:04:01.910]  Why is it God endowed unalienable freedom?
[03:04:01.910 --> 03:04:10.473]  They said right for a reason because the freedom is not always used rightly.
[03:04:10.473 --> 03:04:11.953]  So you have the power.
[03:04:11.953 --> 03:04:13.413]  That's what freedom essentially is.
[03:04:13.413 --> 03:04:14.974]  It's the power to do something.
[03:04:15.962 --> 03:04:21.787]  The real choice is the power to get something done, affect something in a certain way.
[03:04:21.787 --> 03:04:25.491]  And if you use that power wrongly, is it still a right?
[03:04:26.550 --> 03:04:29.091]  Do we ponder these questions any more properly?
[03:04:29.091 --> 03:04:34.353]  I'm going to be talking about that in terms of specific issues right after we get back from this break.
[03:04:34.353 --> 03:04:49.720]  And I hope you prepare your mind, shake off the doldrums that we're sometimes in, because I want us to think about not just that particular issue, but its implications for our liberty, understood as righteous self-government.
[03:04:49.720 --> 03:04:50.240]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:53.394 --> 03:04:57.396]  It's really smart to get high quality storable food at InfoWareStore.com.

[03:05:55.570 --> 03:05:57.510]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:05:57.510 --> 03:06:00.071]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[03:06:00.071 --> 03:06:05.332]  Welcome back.
[03:06:05.332 --> 03:06:06.452]  I love that line.
[03:06:06.452 --> 03:06:09.673]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:06:09.673 --> 03:06:11.294]  Right?
[03:06:11.294 --> 03:06:19.256]  And what your mind needs to be reminded of sometimes is that the war for your mind turns out to be a war for your soul.
[03:06:19.256 --> 03:06:20.356]  See?
[03:06:21.167 --> 03:06:33.595]  It's a war for your heart, it's a war for your soul, and the issues that we talk about, sometimes altogether too nonchalantly, invite this kind of reflection, but we don't, we're not invited anymore to think of it that way.
[03:06:33.595 --> 03:06:36.737]  Matter of fact, I think they want us to stay away from all of that.
[03:06:36.737 --> 03:06:38.778]  And they try to get us to be all frightened of it.
[03:06:38.778 --> 03:06:40.119]  That's religious stuff.
[03:06:40.119 --> 03:06:42.561]  You can't talk about religion in politics.
[03:06:42.561 --> 03:06:44.302]  How can it be that we've become a people?
[03:06:45.501 --> 03:06:52.166]  Based on the notion, the country started, had a big war, looked impossible but they got through it anyway.
[03:06:52.166 --> 03:06:56.468]  Had a big war again over slavery, looked impossible but they got through it anyway.
[03:06:56.468 --> 03:07:05.695]  And both those major wars in the history of the United States, Revolutionary War and Civil War, they weren't just based on a question of what's in your pocketbook and so forth and so on.
[03:07:05.695 --> 03:07:09.237]  They were based on the question of whether it's right or wrong.
[03:07:10.123 --> 03:07:22.395]  To abuse other human beings as you are using the freedom that you have on account of your material wealth or power or position.
[03:07:22.395 --> 03:07:23.496]  See?
[03:07:23.496 --> 03:07:33.026]  We're always arguing about what makes us more wealthy and more powerful and gets us into this or that position and so forth and so on, but the argument that brought the country into existence
[03:07:33.874 --> 03:07:42.876]  Was an argument over whether the use of one's freedom, not just the freedom, but is the use of your freedom in accordance with right.
[03:07:42.876 --> 03:07:47.237]  That's what the word right requires that we think about.
[03:07:47.237 --> 03:07:49.818]  And this occurs to me all the time.
[03:07:49.818 --> 03:07:58.480]  It occurred to me as I was reading an article recently in which debates going on in the Senate.
[03:07:58.480 --> 03:08:01.441]  And it was a debate between the people who think that if
[03:08:02.125 --> 03:08:17.217]  Somebody tries to abort a child, and that abortion doesn't succeed, and the child comes out of the womb alive, that there should be a law that says you've got to treat that child as a life that has to be cared for.
[03:08:17.217 --> 03:08:26.525]  It reflects the underlying issue that's at the heart of abortion that nobody wants to talk about, which is the same issue that was at the heart of slavery.
[03:08:26.525 --> 03:08:31.589]  If otherwise innocent people are in your power, do you get
[03:08:32.159 --> 03:08:35.480]  Do you get to kill them because they're in your way?
[03:08:35.480 --> 03:08:38.341]  Do you get to kill them because it's more convenient for you?
[03:08:38.341 --> 03:08:48.064]  Do you get to kill them because their existence, their continued existence will make you, is going to get in the way of your feelings or will get in the way of your career and so forth?
[03:08:48.064 --> 03:08:49.604]  That's a simple truth.
[03:08:49.604 --> 03:08:51.265]  That's what we're facing.
[03:08:51.265 --> 03:08:59.287]  It's just like powerful countries used to look at other people's lands and say, we get to go in and take whatever we like because we have the power to do it.
[03:09:00.303 --> 03:09:03.124]  That's how the Romans thought about everything.
[03:09:03.124 --> 03:09:04.464]  Were they right?
[03:09:04.464 --> 03:09:08.185]  Well, our founders, thank God, didn't think so.
[03:09:08.185 --> 03:09:12.846]  And I know when I say that, all of those folks are going to stand up and say, well, they had slaves.
[03:09:12.846 --> 03:09:15.147]  What do you mean they didn't think so?
[03:09:15.147 --> 03:09:26.950]  They didn't think so because just like folks today who understand somewhere in their minds what's right, the problem is that in those days, the fact that they were doing wrong
[03:09:27.788 --> 03:09:34.273]  Didn't lead many of them to deny what was the standard of right.
[03:09:34.273 --> 03:09:37.815]  They demanded respect for it anyway, and then they felt what?
[03:09:37.815 --> 03:09:42.018]  They felt guilt, and they felt shame, and they felt difficulty.
[03:09:42.018 --> 03:09:47.382]  Because they knew that they were plodding along this path, they couldn't see their way out of it, but they were doing wrong.
[03:09:47.382 --> 03:09:48.403]  Do you know what we're doing now?
[03:09:49.668 --> 03:09:56.692]  Instead of wrestling with those issues of conscience, we're basically saying, can't decide right and wrong.
[03:09:56.692 --> 03:10:00.374]  It's all relative to how I feel and what power I have and so forth and so on.
[03:10:00.374 --> 03:10:04.877]  And so the only rubric is, is it good for me?
[03:10:04.877 --> 03:10:07.839]  You really think that's a standard of right, do you?
[03:10:07.839 --> 03:10:10.740]  Because it's not the standard we were founded on.
[03:10:10.740 --> 03:10:17.004]  And I know that for some people it's so unpopular to remember, but the words in the Declaration of Independence
[03:10:17.834 --> 03:10:20.916]  Are endowed by their Creator.
[03:10:20.916 --> 03:10:25.340]  All human beings endowed by their Creator.
[03:10:25.340 --> 03:10:34.266]  Not by their will, not by their preference, not by their convenience, not by their bodies, but by their Creator.
[03:10:34.266 --> 03:10:44.854]  With certain unalienable, meaning you can't give them up, can't escape them, can't give them away, and then you ask yourself, well, is that just, that's my freedom.
[03:10:45.612 --> 03:10:51.175]  Well no, it's your freedom only if you are exercising the right.
[03:10:51.175 --> 03:10:55.036]  Exercising the right means implementing it, carrying it into practice.
[03:10:55.036 --> 03:11:10.504]  And so there's big debate going on, and on the Democrat side for the most part, they stopped a bill recently through the cloture procedure, because it requires a supermajority to get something back to the floor for a final vote.
[03:11:11.586 --> 03:11:17.029]  And the Democrats blocked the cloture motion, which would have shut down the debate.
[03:11:17.029 --> 03:11:25.313]  And so they stopped Republican legislation that would require doctors to provide care to babies who survive abortion.
[03:11:25.313 --> 03:11:27.534]  Now think about that.
[03:11:27.534 --> 03:11:37.819]  They call it babies, and at one, I think CNN or somebody actually referred to a fetus that is born alive, they called it.
[03:11:37.819 --> 03:11:39.800]  What is a fetus that is born alive, y'all?
[03:11:40.703 --> 03:11:42.565]  Well, it's us!
[03:11:42.565 --> 03:11:44.006]  You do remember that, right?
[03:11:44.006 --> 03:11:47.689]  You were once a fetus that was born alive.
[03:11:47.689 --> 03:11:48.710]  You think it would have been okay?
[03:11:48.710 --> 03:11:52.533]  You're a fetus, you're born alive, and somebody just takes a gun and shoots your brains out?
[03:11:52.533 --> 03:11:54.534]  You think that's alright?
[03:11:54.534 --> 03:11:57.997]  And they do it because, well, you're mine!
[03:11:57.997 --> 03:11:59.438]  You're my possession!
[03:11:59.438 --> 03:12:03.201]  You're my belonging, and I get to do with you what I want.
[03:12:03.201 --> 03:12:09.767]  I've been trying to make it clear to people that the kind of property that's involved in procreation
[03:12:10.712 --> 03:12:12.774]  Is not instrumental property.
[03:12:12.774 --> 03:12:15.516]  Property we get to use.
[03:12:15.516 --> 03:12:17.357]  It's responsibility property.
[03:12:17.357 --> 03:12:28.286]  Property, belongings for which we are responsible in their care, in their upbringing, in their cultivation, whatever you want to call it, to God.
[03:12:28.286 --> 03:12:32.950]  That's what a God endowed unalienable right is all about.
[03:12:32.950 --> 03:12:40.016]  And so when you deal with a question like this, you're getting into an issue of whether or not
[03:12:41.078 --> 03:12:46.200]  You're going to be thinking when you deal with this question about that claim of right.
[03:12:46.200 --> 03:12:50.321]  Now why should it be so important to everybody?
[03:12:50.321 --> 03:12:52.162]  Because we have a unique form of government.
[03:12:52.162 --> 03:12:54.843]  You do remember, a unique form of government.
[03:12:54.843 --> 03:12:57.084]  Never before in the history of humankind
[03:12:58.169 --> 03:13:11.705]  As a people this large and extensive had the kind of responsibility for the outcomes that determine the fate of governments, who's going to staff them, who's going to lead them, who's going to exercise the power in them.
[03:13:12.535 --> 03:13:21.225]  Never before on the scale that we've known it and especially not with a population so diverse that it now represents all of humanity.
[03:13:21.225 --> 03:13:31.336]  There used to be this idea, no you had to be this kind of person and that kind of person before you could get involved in any governmental decision and it mainly meant power and it mainly meant wealth and to us it means
[03:13:32.346 --> 03:13:44.871]  That you're just a person who is endowed with the same sense of right, the same sense of conscience, and that you have the capacity to let that sense of conscience govern your behavior.
[03:13:44.871 --> 03:13:55.696]  That qualifies you to be somebody who participates in deciding who is going to make key legislative and executive decisions in your society.
[03:13:55.696 --> 03:13:57.997]  But what if you allow that conscience to be destroyed?
[03:13:59.742 --> 03:14:08.490]  But if you've allowed yourself to be turned into somebody who doesn't care about such things, how long do you think this way of life is going to last if we keep this up?
[03:14:08.490 --> 03:14:11.672]  And we look at an article like this and we think, that's about abortion.
[03:14:11.672 --> 03:14:14.294]  No, that's about self-government, y'all.
[03:14:14.294 --> 03:14:23.082]  That's about whether we're going to stick to or deny the premise that keeps powerful people from looking at us and saying, by the way,
[03:14:23.908 --> 03:14:31.374]  When you get in our way, you are no more to us than that child is to the mother.
[03:14:31.374 --> 03:14:32.114]  See?
[03:14:32.114 --> 03:14:38.279]  That child, his or her mother, you're no more to us than the child is to his or her mother.
[03:14:38.279 --> 03:14:52.950]  And we have now accepted the notion that human beings get to choose whether or not people who are so disparate in power from them that they're helpless, that they entirely depend on the forbearance or even the aid of others.
[03:14:53.820 --> 03:14:55.181]  You just get to slaughter them.
[03:14:55.181 --> 03:14:56.202]  Do you really believe that?
[03:14:56.202 --> 03:15:00.166]  Because that's what's really involved in these issues.
[03:15:00.166 --> 03:15:02.448]  And it's more than just this issue.
[03:15:02.448 --> 03:15:08.394]  See, that's the kind of connection that I don't think we're making properly anymore.
[03:15:08.394 --> 03:15:11.978]  We pretend we're dealing with the issues, but we don't realize that in a way
[03:15:12.771 --> 03:15:15.254]  All these issues are the same issue.
[03:15:15.254 --> 03:15:24.144]  And when I get back, I'll go to another issue and show you that you can trace it back to that foundation in just the same way.
[03:15:24.144 --> 03:15:29.130]  And you'll have to reach the same conclusion about what's really involved.
[03:15:29.130 --> 03:15:30.892]  And if we don't keep that in mind,
[03:15:31.488 --> 03:15:42.896]  Then we'll keep dealing carelessly with these issues and wake up one day and find that we got so careless, we just threw all our claim to govern ourselves right out the window.
[03:15:42.896 --> 03:15:43.517]  We'll be right back.
[03:15:51.977 --> 03:15:53.197]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:15:53.197 --> 03:15:57.118]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:15:57.118 --> 03:15:58.659]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:15:58.659 --> 03:16:01.600]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:16:01.600 --> 03:16:07.161]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:16:07.161 --> 03:16:08.361]  I can help you, too.
[03:16:08.361 --> 03:16:11.302]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:16:11.302 --> 03:16:13.523]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:16:13.523 --> 03:16:17.964]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.

[03:16:24.448 --> 03:16:28.171]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[03:16:28.171 --> 03:16:29.252]  Forget bunkers.
[03:16:29.252 --> 03:16:31.093]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[03:16:31.093 --> 03:16:32.794]  You need Survivalist Camps.

[03:17:52.793 --> 03:17:56.015]  There's a lot of phony garbage out there in the world.
[03:17:56.015 --> 03:17:58.396]  A lot of people that never deliver.
[03:17:58.396 --> 03:18:11.624]  Well, I'm here to tell you, InfoWars has delivered in royal flush, in a handful of ace of spades, because of God, because of the audience of activists, and because of the great team at InfoWars.
[03:18:11.624 --> 03:18:14.985]  And we are all a team, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:18:14.985 --> 03:18:18.908]  So right now, Humanity's Awakening is explosive, it's powerful, it's incredible.
[03:18:19.688 --> 03:18:29.032]  But there's major obstacles coming down the road, and the only way we can effectively fight the NWO and stay in the game, like M4 Wars is, to tip the spear, is your financial support.
[03:18:29.032 --> 03:18:31.874]  We make it really easy at m4warsstore.com.
[03:18:31.874 --> 03:18:36.596]  But I am blowing through our backup money right now with our reporters.
[03:18:36.596 --> 03:18:36.976]  We're good.
[03:18:53.777 --> 03:18:54.538]  Real stuff, man.
[03:18:54.538 --> 03:18:55.699]  We're talking about the real deal here.
[03:18:55.699 --> 03:19:01.185]  And I love Trump all day long, but, man, I tell you, he sits there and lets these big tech people keep running roughshod over him.
[03:19:01.185 --> 03:19:04.048]  Everybody, I mean, I've got a problem.
[03:19:04.048 --> 03:19:05.750]  And we'll just take the Trump rallies over.
[03:19:05.750 --> 03:19:08.994]  That said, about two months ago, I came up with a plan that I haven't launched yet.
[03:19:09.534 --> 03:19:13.396]  We have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers.
[03:19:13.396 --> 03:19:14.617]  20 different stickers.
[03:19:14.617 --> 03:19:16.238]  Impeach the Democrats.
[03:19:16.238 --> 03:19:17.319]  Save the Second Amendment.
[03:19:17.319 --> 03:19:18.419]  Defend the First Amendment.
[03:19:18.419 --> 03:19:19.740]  Infowars.com.
[03:19:19.740 --> 03:19:21.922]  And it looks like duct tape, but it's just a regular sticker.
[03:19:21.922 --> 03:19:26.724]  You put it over your mouth, you go to a Trump rally, and you instantly take over without even disrupting things.
[03:19:26.724 --> 03:19:28.265]  People say, why are you doing this?
[03:19:28.265 --> 03:19:28.786]  What's happening?
[03:19:28.786 --> 03:19:32.568]  Well, you go, well, we're being censored, and, you know, Trump won't do anything about it.
[03:19:32.568 --> 03:19:35.690]  And Dr. Pucinich, let me just ask you what you think, because I've not launched this yet.
[03:19:35.930 --> 03:19:36.711]  Brilliant.
[03:19:36.711 --> 03:19:43.816]  You've taken the very element that they try to repress you with, that silence, and made it into a weapon.
[03:19:43.816 --> 03:19:46.759]  You have the loudest sound of all, silence.
[03:19:46.759 --> 03:19:49.581]  And you know what's most disturbing to people?
[03:19:49.581 --> 03:19:55.806]  Silence.
[03:19:55.806 --> 03:19:58.448]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:13.410 --> 03:20:14.371]  Welcome back.
[03:20:14.371 --> 03:20:22.658]  Now I was talking in the last few minutes about this question that's in front of the Congress of a vote on abortion.
[03:20:22.658 --> 03:20:29.044]  And I know we have these parameters that we're supposed to use to talk about the abortion issue and they all missed the point.
[03:20:29.044 --> 03:20:32.587]  And I hope to illustrate very quickly here why they missed the point.
[03:20:33.759 --> 03:20:40.723]  Because, on one side of the argument, you have people who pretend that the issue is just abstract.
[03:20:40.723 --> 03:20:54.791]  And on the other side, you have people who are also, I think, sometimes pretending, but don't quite get all the way where they want to go, that they are seriously interested in making sure that we respect innocent human life.
[03:20:58.119 --> 03:21:17.968]  This led to a situation in which you had people who were arguing against this bill to make sure that fetuses who were not aborted when an abortion was attempted upon them and they come out of the womb as viable living babies, to make sure that they're not being killed.
[03:21:17.968 --> 03:21:22.490]  And they were saying that that is the issue of infant mortality.
[03:21:22.490 --> 03:21:24.151]  No, it's not the issue of infant mortality.
[03:21:24.975 --> 03:21:36.923]  Infant mortality is a statistic about how many children who are ready to be born and are being born die and when they die and how soon during birth or after birth they die.
[03:21:36.923 --> 03:21:38.524]  All that's involved in infant mortality.
[03:21:38.524 --> 03:21:39.964]  That's a general kind of issue.
[03:21:39.964 --> 03:21:41.465]  That's a statistic.
[03:21:41.465 --> 03:21:43.266]  We're talking about individual life.
[03:21:43.266 --> 03:21:44.687]  Yours and mine.
[03:21:44.687 --> 03:21:47.209]  Just like somebody were to come up and over to put a gun to your head.
[03:21:48.035 --> 03:21:57.159]  And it's not only a question of how that makes you feel, but what is the real issue that's involved in deciding whether or not to pull that trigger?
[03:21:57.159 --> 03:22:01.021]  Well, I think we all know that the real issue we generally understand is you just don't do that.
[03:22:01.021 --> 03:22:02.542]  You don't go around murdering people.
[03:22:02.542 --> 03:22:06.944]  Especially not if they're just minding their own business and doing you no harm.
[03:22:06.944 --> 03:22:08.725]  You especially don't get to murder them, do you?
[03:22:09.463 --> 03:22:10.964]  What if they're helpless people?
[03:22:10.964 --> 03:22:13.065]  Absolutely in your power!
[03:22:13.065 --> 03:22:16.406]  You get to murder them then just because you have the power to do it?
[03:22:16.406 --> 03:22:24.410]  Now, when you're just in your common sense mode and you're thinking you would be the individual, you immediately say, no, that's not right.
[03:22:24.410 --> 03:22:31.533]  But you're talking about offspring of humanity in the womb, totally in the power of another human individual.
[03:22:31.533 --> 03:22:37.456]  And they're proven, both of them to be proven individuals now by the genetic markers our science knows all about.
[03:22:38.459 --> 03:22:54.408]  But, one of the Democratic Senators, Derman, suggested that if lawmakers are interested in infant mortality, doing something about it, they should consider that if you're an African-American infant born in America today, you are three times more likely to die in the first year of birth.
[03:22:55.469 --> 03:22:56.990]  But the question isn't about that.
[03:22:56.990 --> 03:22:58.570]  The question in front of them wasn't about that.
[03:22:58.570 --> 03:23:11.615]  The question in front of them was whether or not you're encouraging the mother to kill the child, or to think that she has the right to kill the child, or to think that the course of action that's the only way to escape is to kill the child.
[03:23:11.615 --> 03:23:15.517]  That's not an issue of infant mortality, that's an issue of conscience.
[03:23:15.517 --> 03:23:18.558]  Whether you like it or not, whether you want to admit it or not.
[03:23:18.558 --> 03:23:20.659]  And it's also an issue that goes to the heart
[03:23:21.650 --> 03:23:37.060]  Of our way of life, because the fundamental premise of our way of life is that every individual, powerless, powerful, doesn't matter, is born and before birth, created, equal.
[03:23:37.060 --> 03:23:44.105]  That means, among other things, every individual has an equal claim to be respected in their life.
[03:23:44.105 --> 03:23:44.986]  Right?
[03:23:44.986 --> 03:23:47.587]  Is this going on here or not?
[03:23:47.587 --> 03:23:49.669]  And I found myself thinking about
[03:23:50.737 --> 03:23:54.580]  The fact that they were raising, hey, they're trying to make this a race issue, right?
[03:23:54.580 --> 03:23:59.563]  Well, as I recall, there was a race issue involved in the slavery business.
[03:23:59.563 --> 03:24:06.868]  And that race issue had to do with whether you could use your freedom to take away the freedom of other human beings.
[03:24:06.868 --> 03:24:11.332]  And they're always trying to pretend, oh, people were slave owners and therefore we shouldn't listen to them.
[03:24:11.332 --> 03:24:12.612]  And they have nothing to do with it.
[03:24:12.612 --> 03:24:14.554]  Okay, they were slave owners and they owned slaves.
[03:24:14.554 --> 03:24:16.615]  I'm owned by ancestors and so forth.
[03:24:16.615 --> 03:24:19.617]  I'm supposed to hate on them, but I found that was pretty fruitless.
[03:24:19.617 --> 03:24:20.418]  But leave that aside.
[03:24:21.689 --> 03:24:26.491]  What I do, though, is I think about the real situation that we're faced with here.
[03:24:26.491 --> 03:24:41.336]  So we're talking about people then who owned slaves and enslaved them and kept them in bondage, but where the Constitution regarded those slaves, those enslaved black people, as persons.
[03:24:42.597 --> 03:24:46.018]  Within the meaning of the Constitution's word, persons.
[03:24:46.018 --> 03:24:57.663]  And then they had to agonize over the fact that, wait a minute, if we regard them as persons, that means that according to our understanding of the Declaration, we don't have the right to own these slaves.
[03:24:57.663 --> 03:25:03.885]  And you can read them as they're agonizing, the guys with D's and C's, agonizing over this fact.
[03:25:03.885 --> 03:25:11.788]  Today we have people who don't seem to understand that the very same question is involved in killing children in the womb.
[03:25:12.975 --> 03:25:21.982]  And they're pretending that, oh, I care so much about human life, and yes I do, but I think that if the child gets in the way, that's the mother, and you get to kill it.
[03:25:21.982 --> 03:25:23.243]  No!
[03:25:23.243 --> 03:25:25.465]  They are endowed by their Creator.
[03:25:25.465 --> 03:25:30.930]  That is, as created, you must respect that life.
[03:25:30.930 --> 03:25:37.115]  And that means, from the moment of conception, we used to have a big debate because they wanted the material proof.
[03:25:37.115 --> 03:25:40.177]  If you're not a walking around human being, I don't have to respect you.
[03:25:40.177 --> 03:25:40.778]  Turns out,
[03:25:41.906 --> 03:25:43.027]  That that's not true.
[03:25:43.027 --> 03:25:47.168]  That our science can now see who's human, who's not.
[03:25:47.168 --> 03:25:49.650]  They can see the individual human being.
[03:25:49.650 --> 03:25:53.171]  They can see that that is an individual from the moment of conception.
[03:25:53.171 --> 03:25:56.073]  They can see the relationship with the mother and the whole thing.
[03:25:56.073 --> 03:25:57.273]  Can't deny it anymore.
[03:25:57.273 --> 03:25:59.234]  You're killing people!
[03:25:59.234 --> 03:26:00.655]  You're killing persons!
[03:26:02.259 --> 03:26:15.683]  And the very same people who want to make a big noise about how bad the slaveholders were for enslaving people are not thinking about how bad they are for killing them.
[03:26:15.683 --> 03:26:16.343]  See?
[03:26:16.343 --> 03:26:20.545]  And they'll make all kinds of excuses about it and say they haven't reached this point, they haven't reached that point.
[03:26:20.545 --> 03:26:21.545]  Don't they see that?
[03:26:21.545 --> 03:26:27.547]  When I hear these arguments about how well it's a trimester and it hasn't reached this stage of development, that stage, you do know
[03:26:28.806 --> 03:26:39.253]  That that echoes the very same arguments that were made by John C. Calhoun and the other dyed-in-the-wool, I'm dead set on exercising my freedom to enslave people.
[03:26:39.253 --> 03:26:40.534]  That's the argument they made.
[03:26:41.841 --> 03:26:45.384]  Saying that it was the development, developmental argument.
[03:26:45.384 --> 03:26:47.466]  These people are not in the right stage of development.
[03:26:47.466 --> 03:26:53.011]  They don't have this attribute or that attribute that we regard as worthy and etc.
[03:26:53.011 --> 03:26:55.213]  You really want that applied to you?
[03:26:55.213 --> 03:26:59.797]  Do you think our way of life survives once we have reintroduced the notion?
[03:27:01.155 --> 03:27:20.584]  That absolutely conflicts with the idea that we're all created equal and says instead we must gauge whether or not I can treat you as a person based on whether you satisfy the following 25 criteria of humanity that I've invented for my convenience.
[03:27:20.584 --> 03:27:22.785]  You do know that's where we are, right?
[03:27:22.785 --> 03:27:26.307]  And if you think that just endangers the babes in the womb,
[03:27:27.223 --> 03:27:36.628]  Those of you who are a little up there in the years, getting closer to that point where I'm at the moment, I have to now begin to suspect that I'm getting old.
[03:27:36.628 --> 03:27:39.469]  Well, I'll be one of those elderly people soon.
[03:27:39.469 --> 03:27:40.130]  Right?
[03:27:40.130 --> 03:27:41.811]  Some people would say, I am already.
[03:27:41.811 --> 03:27:43.572]  I don't know.
[03:27:43.572 --> 03:27:46.653]  And at that point, there are people who say, well, I'm just a useless eater.
[03:27:46.653 --> 03:27:48.914]  That's what the Nazis call them.
[03:27:48.914 --> 03:27:51.656]  I shouldn't be left around because I'm just going to be a drain.
[03:27:51.656 --> 03:27:55.798]  And all those people out there more productive than I am, they get to live and you,
[03:27:56.730 --> 03:27:59.311]  You get to die, so it's your choice.
[03:27:59.311 --> 03:28:02.733]  You want to die this way or that way?
[03:28:02.733 --> 03:28:05.875]  Do they really have that right?
[03:28:05.875 --> 03:28:11.677]  You realize we've already answered that question if we go on killing babies in the womb.
[03:28:11.677 --> 03:28:13.338]  Because then it's just a matter of power.
[03:28:13.338 --> 03:28:14.639]  I've got power over you.
[03:28:14.639 --> 03:28:16.680]  You're in my power.
[03:28:16.680 --> 03:28:19.221]  And therefore I get to kill you.
[03:28:19.221 --> 03:28:21.582]  And government has that kind of power.
[03:28:21.582 --> 03:28:23.323]  That's what we're thinking.
[03:28:23.323 --> 03:28:25.104]  It's not supposed to under our system.
[03:28:26.161 --> 03:28:41.719]  And when are we going to wake up and realize when we're dealing with these issues, every time we think about them, we must go to this fundamental question and ask whether the answer will keep us free or make us slaves.
[03:28:41.719 --> 03:28:42.280]  Be right back.
[03:28:52.025 --> 03:28:55.047]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[03:28:55.047 --> 03:28:57.949]  So do you know who's on your wireless network?

[03:30:54.195 --> 03:30:57.437]  This should really be easier than it is.
[03:30:57.437 --> 03:30:59.579]  I'm not here giving you a sales pitch.
[03:30:59.579 --> 03:31:02.061]  I'm pointing out the way forward.
[03:31:02.061 --> 03:31:05.643]  Things that I've discovered that I absolutely know work.

[03:31:18.792 --> 03:31:19.273]  My friends,
[03:31:19.893 --> 03:31:23.815]  I harp and harp and harp about iodine because it's the good halogen.
[03:31:23.815 --> 03:31:25.436]  Fluoride's the bad halogen.
[03:31:25.436 --> 03:31:28.358]  And people told me about it for years and I didn't listen.
[03:31:28.358 --> 03:31:37.283]  And I'm so thankful that finally I listened to Dr. Group like eight years ago and started taking true iodine, atomic iodine.
[03:31:37.603 --> 03:31:45.293]  We've got it back in stock, X2, 40% off right now at InfoWareStore.com and I'm telling you folks, get it.

[03:32:50.130 --> 03:32:52.471]  InfoWars, brought to you by you.
[03:32:55.695 --> 03:33:14.849]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:14.849 --> 03:33:19.512]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:23.123 --> 03:33:31.708]  Now it would be easy for me to say that in the last segment I was talking about the controversy we have in this country over abortion.
[03:33:31.708 --> 03:33:33.289]  Right?
[03:33:33.289 --> 03:33:38.412]  Made a little allusion to the controversy that was once there about slavery.
[03:33:38.412 --> 03:33:44.816]  And the fact that now they have tried to turn the issue of slavery into the issue of racism.
[03:33:44.816 --> 03:33:47.278]  But, is that right?
[03:33:47.278 --> 03:33:49.239]  That's a way of distracting everybody from truth.
[03:33:51.145 --> 03:34:00.436]  Because the issue at the heart of slavery wasn't about the color of the skin of the person being enslaved.
[03:34:00.436 --> 03:34:10.989]  Because though people like to forget it, the very word slave should remind you that the issue involved in slavery has nothing to do with skin color.
[03:34:12.051 --> 03:34:12.952]  Why, Alan?
[03:34:12.952 --> 03:34:38.190]  Because, as I read the etymological dictionary, that word slave was actually a function of the fact that in the part of the Mediterranean world, when the Islamic empires were all ruling that basin, pretty much, and various parts of it, they used to highly value on the slave markets in the Islamic world, guess who they highly valued?
[03:34:38.190 --> 03:34:41.253]  Blonde, white-skinned slobs.
[03:34:41.977 --> 03:34:43.638]  We're valued as slaves.
[03:34:43.638 --> 03:34:44.919]  See?
[03:34:44.919 --> 03:34:47.641]  Slavery wasn't about skin color then.
[03:34:47.641 --> 03:34:53.525]  It was about the fact that they thought these folks made wonderful slaves.
[03:34:53.525 --> 03:34:55.686]  And the slavery wasn't racist.
[03:34:55.686 --> 03:35:06.893]  It was about thinking that because you had the power and conquered people or defeated them in this or that battle or stole them away in this or that way, you got to make them slaves.
[03:35:06.893 --> 03:35:10.636]  And you would just exercise that power and nobody got in your way and you could do it.
[03:35:11.727 --> 03:35:13.948]  That's the issue at the heart of it.
[03:35:13.948 --> 03:35:15.409]  It's not race.
[03:35:15.409 --> 03:35:20.392]  So when they try to turn it into an issue of racism, I'm sitting there questioning that.
[03:35:20.392 --> 03:35:21.332]  It's not about race.
[03:35:21.332 --> 03:35:24.314]  It's about, unless you're talking about human race.
[03:35:24.314 --> 03:35:39.242]  I often try to get people to see that when it comes to these questions and when it comes to the challenge facing us as a people in the United States, the question isn't black racism, this racism, color racism, no, human race.
[03:35:39.242 --> 03:35:41.003]  It's anti-human racism.
[03:35:42.549 --> 03:35:47.393]  And right now, that's the racism that's taking over the place.
[03:35:47.393 --> 03:36:02.825]  People who are disregarding the claims of our common humanity and wanting to act as if the mere fact that I'm dealing with a human being doesn't mean that there's anything there to respect anymore, unless it serves my purpose.
[03:36:03.982 --> 03:36:13.711]  Unless it can be instrumental to something that has to do with my welfare, my prosperity, my gain, my ambition, my happiness, then I have to respect you.
[03:36:13.711 --> 03:36:15.792]  Otherwise, get out of the way.
[03:36:15.792 --> 03:36:23.979]  And if you don't get out, I get to kill you and push you over the cliff so that you won't be around to be in my way anymore.
[03:36:23.979 --> 03:36:29.184]  And you know, that's going to take us right back to the oldest possible way of doing things.
[03:36:30.658 --> 03:36:32.639]  A way that most of us should just put it in front of them.
[03:36:32.639 --> 03:36:33.359]  That's wicked!
[03:36:33.359 --> 03:36:35.240]  That shouldn't be happening!
[03:36:35.240 --> 03:36:39.402]  Why are those people getting brutalized this way when they're human beings?
[03:36:39.402 --> 03:36:40.323]  People shouldn't do that!
[03:36:41.724 --> 03:37:01.276]  And then I see these young people now and they're talking about issues of life and death and it's all the pretend world of I get to choose and if in the end I'm choosing this callous disregard for all the information and personhood and everything, that doesn't matter because that's my way.
[03:37:01.276 --> 03:37:02.037]  I get to do it my way.
[03:37:02.037 --> 03:37:03.958]  That's freedom!
[03:37:03.958 --> 03:37:04.098]  See?
[03:37:04.098 --> 03:37:07.240]  Yeah, but the word in the Declaration isn't freedom.
[03:37:07.240 --> 03:37:10.722]  It's actually liberty and it's defined as an unalienable right
[03:37:11.334 --> 03:37:22.258]  An unalienable right is based on what we would today call the encoded inclination to do what's right.
[03:37:22.258 --> 03:37:32.983]  In a way that then not only preserves this individual, but our physical flesh is programmed to actually take care of humanity as a whole.
[03:37:32.983 --> 03:37:36.424]  Procreation is about the preservation of the whole human race.
[03:37:37.663 --> 03:37:44.807]  Somewhere in there, there's a thought that sees the existence of the whole community.
[03:37:44.807 --> 03:37:51.291]  And that really sees it as well when you think about eating and drinking and the necessary relationship with stuff that's around us.
[03:37:51.291 --> 03:37:59.335]  Thinks about how you follow through on that in a way that respects our relationship to all the stuff that's out there in the universe.
[03:37:59.335 --> 03:38:01.636]  Kind of reminds me of that biblical phrase about
[03:38:03.294 --> 03:38:09.035]  That all things work together for good for those who love the Lord, and then Christ defines love as obedience.
[03:38:09.035 --> 03:38:22.877]  So if you are walking in the way of that law of nature, then you're doing what will help you to survive, even as it depends on a world that has been put together in such a way that you can survive in it.
[03:38:22.877 --> 03:38:32.099]  And that it can survive you, by the way, contrary to the whole we're going to destroy the universe pretense of some of the people talking about climate change.
[03:38:32.958 --> 03:38:34.719]  But it's not only that issue.
[03:38:34.719 --> 03:38:42.145]  So another headline that was about a Governor Grisham in New Mexico.
[03:38:42.145 --> 03:38:44.847]  And she they've just passed a law there.
[03:38:44.847 --> 03:38:54.994]  And that law essentially amounts to allowing officers, state officers, to come in and confiscate guns under court order and so forth.
[03:38:54.994 --> 03:38:56.916]  Is that right?
[03:38:56.916 --> 03:38:58.697]  There is that little thing in the Constitution.
[03:38:59.665 --> 03:39:02.547]  About how the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[03:39:02.547 --> 03:39:06.169]  To keep means to hold on to.
[03:39:06.169 --> 03:39:07.390]  Right?
[03:39:07.390 --> 03:39:09.831]  And so they're saying, no, you don't get to hold on to that gun.
[03:39:09.831 --> 03:39:13.213]  If we tell you to give it up, you're going to give it up to us and all the sheriffs.
[03:39:13.213 --> 03:39:14.854]  Whatever you may think, you have to give it up.
[03:39:14.854 --> 03:39:18.756]  And the sheriffs are probably sitting there thinking, wait a minute, I can read the Constitution as well as you.
[03:39:18.756 --> 03:39:22.298]  And it says right here that I don't get to do that.
[03:39:22.298 --> 03:39:25.380]  It says that the right to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged.
[03:39:26.235 --> 03:39:26.575]  Right?
[03:39:26.575 --> 03:39:34.461]  That means shall not be cut back on, so that it doesn't exist anymore, so that it's constrained in the way that you're trying to constrain it.
[03:39:34.461 --> 03:39:36.322]  So people can't even have guns in their home.
[03:39:36.322 --> 03:39:38.564]  I'll go in there and take them out.
[03:39:38.564 --> 03:39:42.326]  Anybody who has a gun, I just get to take it, because some court has ordered it.
[03:39:42.326 --> 03:39:46.029]  But has that court acted constitutionally or unconstitutionally?
[03:39:46.029 --> 03:39:48.151]  And you all say, well, the court gets to decide that.
[03:39:48.151 --> 03:39:50.292]  Well, no, it doesn't actually.
[03:39:50.292 --> 03:39:55.536]  That's why the revolution occurred, you see, because the court, in this case it was the court of King George,
[03:39:56.651 --> 03:39:59.712]  Uh, who was in charge of the colonies.
[03:39:59.712 --> 03:40:06.954]  And that court decided that they could abridge the rights of the American people.
[03:40:06.954 --> 03:40:09.095]  And they said no, and that's how come the whole thing started.
[03:40:09.095 --> 03:40:13.736]  The whole country was based on a revolution made against that notion.
[03:40:13.736 --> 03:40:15.837]  And it's what I try to remind folks of.
[03:40:15.837 --> 03:40:19.298]  We have an individual responsibility to respect these things.
[03:40:19.298 --> 03:40:24.520]  And ultimately, this whole Second Amendment thing, what is it really about?
[03:40:24.520 --> 03:40:25.360]  It's about two things.
[03:40:27.043 --> 03:40:38.331]  It is about how necessary it can be to have the means you need to use if someone's threatening your life to stop them from taking it.
[03:40:38.331 --> 03:40:39.792]  That's part of the reason.
[03:40:39.792 --> 03:40:45.476]  It was also involved in those days with hunting and doing other stuff you needed to procure food for yourself.
[03:40:45.476 --> 03:40:54.863]  So, that sense of self-preservation wasn't just in the moment you were threatened, it was also in the pursuit of what was necessary to keep you alive, right?
[03:40:55.982 --> 03:41:20.244]  Is it necessary to keep you alive, as the person you are, for you to stand up and defend your liberty as an individual citizen of the United States of America, which liberty depends on regard for the declaration premise of God-endowed, unalienable rights, and on the respect demanded for that premise in the Constitution of the United States?
[03:41:22.063 --> 03:41:33.631]  If they disregard that God-endowed, unalienable right to which all human persons are entitled, are they still treating you as a person?
[03:41:33.631 --> 03:41:42.737]  Or are they batting aside that fact in order to pursue their own aims or ends?
[03:41:42.737 --> 03:41:47.260]  And is that in accordance with respect for your personhood?
[03:41:47.260 --> 03:41:51.663]  Because if it isn't, that God-endowed, unalienable right
[03:41:52.290 --> 03:41:56.013]  To represent the nature the Creator has given you.
[03:41:56.013 --> 03:42:03.099]  Because the word persona was the mask that actors used on the Roman or Greek stage to represent a character.
[03:42:03.099 --> 03:42:05.961]  And what character do we represent in our nature?
[03:42:05.961 --> 03:42:09.524]  We represent the character of God.
[03:42:09.524 --> 03:42:10.604]  See?
[03:42:10.604 --> 03:42:12.546]  That's what the script is very clear about that.
[03:42:12.546 --> 03:42:17.630]  But it's also there in the logic that underlies our claim to rights.
[03:42:18.268 --> 03:42:19.389]  Uh, which the U.S.
[03:42:19.389 --> 03:42:21.711]  Constitution was codifying, that's all.
[03:42:21.711 --> 03:42:24.773]  Didn't create the right, just codifying.
[03:42:24.773 --> 03:42:26.114]  See that connection?
[03:42:26.114 --> 03:42:31.799]  Suddenly, this disrespect for persons is right here in the Second Amendment issue as well.
[03:42:31.799 --> 03:42:32.620]  Did you think of that?
[03:42:32.620 --> 03:42:34.301]  Ponder that.
[03:42:34.301 --> 03:42:34.941]  We'll be right back.
[03:42:51.866 --> 03:43:00.053]  It's wonderful that so many people are now thinking about preparedness, and that we're seeing record food sales, not just here, but across the world.
[03:43:00.053 --> 03:43:00.633]  That's good.
[03:43:00.633 --> 03:43:03.015]  People need to be self-sufficient.
[03:43:03.015 --> 03:43:10.000]  The average person is living hand-to-mouth, paycheck-to-paycheck, and doesn't even know how to change their tire.
[03:43:10.000 --> 03:43:13.683]  We need to reverse this trend and start getting prepared.
[03:43:13.683 --> 03:43:20.669]  And that means even with just the basics, even a three-week food supply that you know is always there, that you only go to in emergencies.
[03:43:21.249 --> 03:43:26.453]  That said, boosting your immune system is just as critical, or even more so.
[03:43:26.453 --> 03:43:34.738]  And things like DNA Force Plus, that's now back in stock, is so good for your cells, your mitochondria, your telomeres, the engine of your body.
[03:43:34.738 --> 03:43:44.144]  It's back in stock, 40% off right now, along with Ultra 12, and along with Vitamin Mineral Fusion, and a bunch of other great products that are finally back in stock.

[03:43:49.788 --> 03:43:50.208]  A total 360 win.
[03:43:53.071 --> 03:43:54.553]  Alright folks, here's the bad news.
[03:43:54.553 --> 03:44:03.161]  We've already sold out of the 16 ounce immune gargle with the patented nanotech silver that's documented to knock out viruses and bacteria unlike anything else.
[03:44:03.161 --> 03:44:07.306]  But, we do still have it in the 3 ounce and the 1 ounce for a limited time.
[03:44:07.306 --> 03:44:09.208]  The good news is we have
[03:44:09.628 --> 03:44:15.871]  The super blue toothpaste and the super silver toothpaste both that have the nano silver in them as well.
[03:44:15.871 --> 03:44:21.634]  The super blue has tea tree that's also antiviral and antibacterial and high quality iodine.
[03:44:21.634 --> 03:44:32.220]  And then of course the whitening has the nano silver but on top of that it has the above sea coral calcium that re-minimalizes the teeth and so it's just the best toothpaste you're going to find period.
[03:44:32.220 --> 03:44:35.642]  It has the nano silver and we still have supplies of it though it'll sell out
[03:44:35.902 --> 03:44:36.242]  That's right.
[03:44:53.590 --> 03:44:54.371]  Real stuff, man.
[03:44:54.371 --> 03:44:55.531]  We're talking about the real deal here.
[03:44:55.531 --> 03:45:00.995]  And I love Trump all day long, but man, I tell you, he sits here and lets these big tech people keep running roughshod over him.
[03:45:00.995 --> 03:45:03.857]  Everybody, I mean, I've got a problem.
[03:45:03.857 --> 03:45:05.579]  And we'll just take the Trump rallies over.
[03:45:05.579 --> 03:45:08.821]  That said, about two months ago, I came up with a plan that I haven't launched yet.
[03:45:09.361 --> 03:45:12.624]  We have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers.
[03:45:12.624 --> 03:45:14.466]  20 different stickers.
[03:45:14.466 --> 03:45:16.087]  Impeach the Democrats.
[03:45:16.087 --> 03:45:17.148]  Save the Second Amendment.
[03:45:17.148 --> 03:45:18.229]  Defend the First Amendment.
[03:45:18.229 --> 03:45:19.570]  Infowars.com.
[03:45:19.570 --> 03:45:21.752]  And it looks like duct tape, but it's just a regular sticker.
[03:45:21.752 --> 03:45:26.477]  You put it over your mouth, you go to a Trump rally, and you instantly take over without even disrupting things.
[03:45:26.477 --> 03:45:28.098]  People say, why are you doing this?
[03:45:28.098 --> 03:45:28.619]  What's happening?
[03:45:28.619 --> 03:45:30.180]  Well, you go, well, we're being censored.
[03:45:30.180 --> 03:45:32.402]  You know, Trump won't do anything about it.
[03:45:32.402 --> 03:45:35.505]  And Dr. Pucinich, let me just ask you what you think, because I've not watched this yet.
[03:45:35.765 --> 03:45:36.546]  Brilliant.
[03:45:36.546 --> 03:45:43.634]  You've taken the very element that they try to repress you with, that silence, and made it into a weapon.
[03:45:43.634 --> 03:45:46.577]  You have the loudest sound of all, silence.
[03:45:46.577 --> 03:45:49.421]  And you know what's most disturbing to people?
[03:45:49.421 --> 03:45:50.101]  Silence.
[03:45:52.073 --> 03:45:55.114]  There's a lot of things I can say about the high-quality, storable food.
[03:45:55.114 --> 03:45:56.835]  We sell it in fullrestore.com.
[03:45:56.835 --> 03:46:02.917]  But everybody knows any product I sell is going to be high-quality at a great price because I treat you like I want to be treated.
[03:46:02.917 --> 03:46:05.738]  It is my religion, the golden rule.
[03:46:05.738 --> 03:46:13.821]  But the bad news is our main sponsor that does a great job, MyPatriot, is now three to four weeks out before they ship food.
[03:46:13.821 --> 03:46:15.702]  They have the food, but they've got to package it.
[03:46:15.822 --> 03:46:20.268]  And any day now, they may come and tell me, oh, sorry, we're not selling food anymore.
[03:46:20.268 --> 03:46:23.192]  Because they're not going to take orders for food they don't have.
[03:46:23.192 --> 03:46:26.396]  Now, you get your order in now, you get the high quality food.
[03:46:26.396 --> 03:46:27.457]  It's a smart move.
[03:46:27.457 --> 03:46:28.459]  It funds the M4.
[03:46:28.459 --> 03:46:29.360]  You can't lose.
[03:46:29.360 --> 03:46:33.225]  Take action at M4restore.com, whether it's three weeks, four weeks, five weeks, six weeks.
[03:46:33.465 --> 03:46:34.606]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:47:11.358 --> 03:47:23.642]  I don't want to miss the opportunity to say, once again, how wonderful it is to be sharing these ideas with you in the context of InfoWars.
[03:47:23.642 --> 03:47:26.743]  Because I think that information takes all kinds of forms.
[03:47:26.743 --> 03:47:32.945]  These days we think of it as discrete little tidbits talking about this issue, that issue, this fact, that fact.
[03:47:32.945 --> 03:47:37.246]  Our preoccupation with material, physical, empirical science
[03:47:38.332 --> 03:47:43.293]  Sometimes takes our understanding of information and corrupts it.
[03:47:43.293 --> 03:47:49.374]  So that we think that information is just about, quote, facts, unquote.
[03:47:49.374 --> 03:47:55.355]  But in terms of dealing with other human beings, have you noticed that human beings are not just facts?
[03:47:55.355 --> 03:48:00.776]  I mean, their existence is a fact, the things they do or acts they take are a fact, and so forth and so on.
[03:48:00.776 --> 03:48:04.117]  But each human being you meet is not just a fact.
[03:48:04.117 --> 03:48:06.217]  That human being is, in a way, a meaning, right?
[03:48:07.405 --> 03:48:19.254]  And in the context of our shared way of life, we still share it, even though some people seem to be quietly trying to get us to destroy it, but we still share it, or we pretend to.
[03:48:19.254 --> 03:48:22.477]  And that shared way of life is based on certain ideas.
[03:48:22.477 --> 03:48:27.641]  And one of those ideas has at the root of it, respect for other people.
[03:48:28.974 --> 03:48:32.377]  Not respect according to the standard of my will.
[03:48:32.377 --> 03:48:34.318]  Not even when it's a majority will.
[03:48:34.318 --> 03:48:37.061]  That was one of the things they agonized over with the Constitution.
[03:48:37.061 --> 03:48:41.064]  Making sure that it wasn't just majority will.
[03:48:41.064 --> 03:48:42.665]  And I'm really grateful for that.
[03:48:42.665 --> 03:48:42.945]  See?
[03:48:42.945 --> 03:48:45.307]  A lot of people think, well nothing to do with the slave owners.
[03:48:45.307 --> 03:48:46.968]  Don't be grateful to them.
[03:48:46.968 --> 03:48:48.470]  Why not?
[03:48:48.470 --> 03:48:51.392]  By remembering the standard.
[03:48:51.392 --> 03:48:55.295]  They gave people something to appeal to against the evil.
[03:48:56.445 --> 03:49:05.907]  If they had forgotten the standard, if they had torn it away, torn it out of the heart, torn it out of the minds, then there would have been no appeal but to arms.
[03:49:05.907 --> 03:49:18.431]  And the appeal but to arms, that involves persuading the people who already have the power to change their minds, I guess, without any argument that persuasively convinces them to do so.
[03:49:18.431 --> 03:49:24.012]  Or you wait until you get enough power and then you kill them and stuff, and then we can have bloodbaths and all this kind of stuff.
[03:49:24.696 --> 03:49:27.859]  Aren't you glad that didn't work quite that way here?
[03:49:27.859 --> 03:49:32.763]  We had our wars and we had our conflicts and we had our difficulties with people killing each other.
[03:49:32.763 --> 03:49:45.553]  But what made this country what it is was the ability to resolve those things on the basis of a shared understanding that allowed us to talk each other into doing what's right.
[03:49:45.553 --> 03:49:46.994]  And that's what I've been talking about here.
[03:49:46.994 --> 03:49:49.697]  And how do you do that?
[03:49:49.697 --> 03:49:51.358]  Well, there are certain prerequisites.
[03:49:51.358 --> 03:49:53.380]  You've got to be able to understand what's going on.
[03:49:54.128 --> 03:49:58.091]  And that's why I'm sure I'm about to say something that's going to shock you.
[03:49:58.091 --> 03:50:05.317]  I'm not sure that Bernie Sanders is exactly wrong to talk about how important it is that people should be educated.
[03:50:05.317 --> 03:50:15.845]  He talks about praising, they talk about him beating him up because he praised Castro for having a good literacy program and China for taking people out of poverty and so forth and so on.
[03:50:15.845 --> 03:50:18.487]  And I think that's part of the story.
[03:50:18.487 --> 03:50:22.610]  But the interesting thing that I always think of when people start talking that way
[03:50:23.294 --> 03:50:33.100]  As I think back over why it is that I still find the whole memory of my ancestors in slavery repugnant.
[03:50:33.100 --> 03:50:36.201]  It still makes me feel somewhere inside me like I want to fight.
[03:50:36.201 --> 03:50:38.342]  That's what the word repugnant means.
[03:50:38.342 --> 03:50:41.964]  Takes you back to the point where you think you really ought to fight over that.
[03:50:41.964 --> 03:50:42.665]  Right?
[03:50:42.665 --> 03:50:45.166]  Why do you think you ought to fight over that?
[03:50:45.166 --> 03:50:48.088]  Because there's more to being a human being
[03:50:48.769 --> 03:51:16.595]  Then these external things like that, even externalized attributes like that, that we can appreciate, but if the whole thing doesn't come together in a way that respects the meaning of the human person, the meaning of the whole package, then you could have literacy programs and people taken out of poverty and you're not treating them like people, you're not treating them like persons, you're not treating them like human beings.
[03:51:18.337 --> 03:51:20.458]  That's what I think is happening in China right now.
[03:51:20.458 --> 03:51:26.601]  I think China has a regime in which they have all kinds of wonderful material goals for everybody.
[03:51:26.601 --> 03:51:31.423]  The one goal they don't have is to treat people like people.
[03:51:31.423 --> 03:51:41.247]  Because if you don't treat people in a way that respects their God-endowed, unalienable rights, that sense that makes them responsible,
[03:51:41.943 --> 03:51:59.153]  For the choices they make, and keeping those choices in line with a standard of right and justice that applies to everybody like them in the world, all the human beings in the world, and also, by the way, if you take Christ seriously, all creation.
[03:51:59.153 --> 03:52:02.394]  So that all things work together for good.
[03:52:02.394 --> 03:52:05.376]  Then you're going to get into serious trouble.
[03:52:05.376 --> 03:52:06.797]  And that's why the statement
[03:52:07.443 --> 03:52:25.838]  That somehow or another that's a justification for all the millions of people murdered by communist regimes and totalitarian regimes and all the repression and all the death camps and all the gulags and to this day what's being done to Uyghurs and others where their conscience is not being respected, they're being put in camps!
[03:52:26.610 --> 03:52:37.657]  Because they think that they ought to be worshipping God and trying to do right in a certain way that's harmless to others, but that they must stop because it doesn't follow your party line.
[03:52:37.657 --> 03:52:42.300]  That's starting to happen to Christians in this country.
[03:52:42.300 --> 03:52:46.643]  It's called freedom of religion, the exercise of religion, but it's important
[03:52:47.634 --> 03:52:54.816]  Because, as human beings, we must be encouraged to take responsibility for those issues.
[03:52:54.816 --> 03:52:59.477]  To look to the standard that's higher than the standard of our will.
[03:52:59.477 --> 03:53:03.679]  And have some sense of how we mean to serve it.
[03:53:03.679 --> 03:53:04.459]  And respect it.
[03:53:05.855 --> 03:53:17.824]  And in the ways that kind of take the common denominators of our concerns and try to put them in a codified form, the Constitution helps us to remember what some of those are.
[03:53:17.824 --> 03:53:29.673]  And among them is this business of not killing other people just because they're in our way or because we have the power to do so or because doing so will help us to feel better and maybe get happier and something.
[03:53:29.673 --> 03:53:34.117]  It's taking seriously the responsibility that is encoded into this flesh.
[03:53:34.907 --> 03:53:54.822]  Reminding us that we're not just individuals, that we are bound somehow through the will of our Creator to an obligation that has to do with whether or not this whole human race that we're part of, with all its diversity and everything, whether that's going to be perpetuated, that's procreation.
[03:53:54.822 --> 03:53:59.706]  And we're treating that aspect of our conscience now with the utmost carelessness.
[03:54:00.603 --> 03:54:18.808]  And we think it's just one issue over here in the corner when in fact it is an issue where the thread of truth that it involves underlies everything we're supposed to be as a people and therefore everything we must be respected in as persons.
[03:54:18.808 --> 03:54:20.708]  Get that?
[03:54:20.708 --> 03:54:23.529]  We need to start seeing these things in their right context.
[03:54:24.338 --> 03:54:49.877]  If we keep allowing ourselves to pretend that they're just isolated points of light or darkness here or there or otherwhere, then we're shredding the foundations of our way of life and we're shredding the fabric in our character and in fact for our claim and ability to maintain this way of life.
[03:54:50.529 --> 03:55:11.617]  Which invites people who are willing to listen to the information of righteousness within them to participate in the key decisions that determine not only their individual destiny, but the destiny of their whole family, community, nation, even world.
[03:55:11.617 --> 03:55:13.338]  That's at the heart of our citizenship.
[03:55:14.959 --> 03:55:25.641]  Well, I hope that that makes some sense to you and that you'll notice it as we go through various issues, if I get a chance to share time with you in the future.
[03:55:25.641 --> 03:55:28.641]  And it's somewhere always in the back of my mind.
[03:55:28.641 --> 03:55:34.002]  And I guess it's because, given my background, I had to wrestle with this a lot.
[03:55:34.002 --> 03:55:43.444]  And at the end of the day, I came to love my country, the United States of America, not because it had done everything right and people were always wonderful to me or in general.
[03:55:44.881 --> 03:56:09.827]  But because people, time and again, finally decided that the ideas of common humanity, that respect our individual responsibility to God, to respect the meaning of human life, not just its physical necessities and attributes and consequences, that that's common ground for us.
[03:56:09.827 --> 03:56:12.468]  And it's common ground that I think is more than worthwhile.
[03:56:13.379 --> 03:56:23.082]  It's common ground that deserves the sacrifice of life that so many Americans have made in the name of liberty.
[03:56:23.082 --> 03:56:42.747]  Not as the freedom to do what you please, but as the freedom to please God by doing in righteousness what upholds the meaning of life, the respect for the wholesomeness of life in individuals and in the community we can build together.
[03:56:43.547 --> 03:56:47.581]  When we respect that ground or foundation.
[03:56:47.581 --> 03:56:47.982]  You see that?
[03:56:49.255 --> 03:56:50.496]  Well, I hope you do.
[03:56:50.496 --> 03:56:53.357]  And I'll keep trying to get more and more people to see it.
[03:56:53.357 --> 03:56:55.718]  That's all I've been about for the last little while.
[03:56:55.718 --> 03:57:04.422]  And it's all I'll be about, I think, as I get closer and closer to the time when I get a little rest, hopefully, in God.
[03:57:04.422 --> 03:57:09.525]  And because I think that over time you learn, you've got to walk that walk.
[03:57:09.525 --> 03:57:14.667]  It's better for others, and it probably will turn out to be overall better for me, better for everybody.
[03:57:15.396 --> 03:57:19.082]  Well, anyway, War Room with Owen Schroyer is next.
[03:57:19.082 --> 03:57:24.690]  Alex and Owen, by the way, are live at CPAC tonight, so that should be exciting.
[03:57:24.690 --> 03:57:26.834]  And I will be back tomorrow.
[03:57:26.834 --> 03:57:28.236]  So, take care until then.
