[00:00.000 --> 00:19.000]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[00:19.000 --> 00:24.640]  all right welcome to the Alex Jones show Mike Adams here for the first half of
[00:24.640 --> 00:29.720]  show it's February 26th already just amazing we've got a bombshell show for
[00:29.720 --> 00:33.680]  you today I've done a full analysis of what's going on and I believe that the
[00:33.680 --> 00:39.740]  CDC is setting a trap for Trump and the Trump is about to commit perhaps
[00:39.740 --> 00:43.760]  political suicide this evening by addressing the nation at 6 p.m. Eastern
[00:43.760 --> 00:48.040]  to tell the nation that everything's fine with this coronavirus situation I
[00:48.040 --> 00:54.520]  think that Trump's advisors are setting him up to take the fall when this
[00:54.520 --> 00:58.760]  pandemic spreads in America but not everybody agrees with me so we're gonna
[00:58.760 --> 01:02.240]  cover some different angles here some different possibilities one of the
[01:02.240 --> 01:06.680]  interesting things that has come out is Dr. Nancy Messonnier of the CDC who's
[01:06.680 --> 01:11.960]  the one saying that this is going to spread in America reportedly she is the
[01:11.960 --> 01:15.720]  sister now I haven't confirmed this fully yet but reportedly she's the sister
[01:15.720 --> 01:21.920]  of Rod Rosenstein if that's true then it starts to beg a lot of questions what
[01:21.920 --> 01:26.400]  are the various agendas here is Rod working with William Barr against the
[01:26.400 --> 01:30.920]  Deep State or is he still part of the Deep State that's the anti-Trump agenda
[01:30.920 --> 01:35.520]  and also today Rush Limbaugh has chimed in on this there was a caller yesterday
[01:35.520 --> 01:42.680]  at his show that mentioned my name and my work and Rush said that basically this
[01:42.680 --> 01:48.080]  is really no big deal that the coronavirus is no worse than the flu but
[01:48.080 --> 01:52.120]  another radio host Michael Savage is outraged that Rush would say such a
[01:52.120 --> 01:55.760]  thing Michael Savage of course is a brilliant scientist with a background in
[01:55.760 --> 01:59.760]  epidemiology Michael Savage I think agrees with most of what I'm saying and
[01:59.760 --> 02:04.120]  I'm citing the CDC when I say that there's virtually no testing taking place
[02:04.120 --> 02:10.160]  in the United States now on top of that we have the Public Health Laboratory
[02:10.160 --> 02:15.440]  Association of America that is tired of waiting for the CDC to fix their test
[02:15.440 --> 02:20.080]  kits their test kits don't work and as of this morning the CDC's numbers show
[02:20.080 --> 02:26.120]  that only 426 Americans have been tested for the coronavirus by the CDC that's
[02:26.120 --> 02:32.520]  it 426 I mean it's it's it's astonishing how are you supposed to find
[02:32.520 --> 02:36.560]  community outbreaks if you're not testing for community outbreaks when
[02:36.560 --> 02:41.920]  South Korea is testing 28,000 people and America is only testing 400 how are you
[02:41.920 --> 02:46.000]  supposed to detect community outbreaks so you now have these labs with his lab
[02:46.000 --> 02:50.640]  association going to the FDA saying give us permission to do our own tests so
[02:50.640 --> 02:55.000]  that we can test it and I believe in fact I'm gonna present evidence for you
[02:55.000 --> 03:00.680]  here today I believe that the CDC is withholding test kits to set a trap for
[03:00.680 --> 03:05.240]  President Trump so that Trump can take the blame when the pandemic explodes in
[03:05.240 --> 03:11.080]  America and Senator Schumer and even Mitt Romney are ready to pounce on
[03:11.080 --> 03:16.560]  Trump and blame him for the pandemic that's coming I think we're looking at
[03:16.560 --> 03:25.080]  a possible Trump defeat if he doesn't handle this correctly and that's why
[03:25.080 --> 03:30.680]  today on the show I'm gonna urge Trump to get up to speed to be upfront with
[03:30.680 --> 03:34.200]  the American people about what's coming so we can be prepared prepared and not
[03:34.200 --> 03:38.680]  panic we don't want panic we want preparedness which is the opposite of
[03:38.680 --> 03:43.960]  panic so we've got all those stories today plus amazing clips oh by the way
[03:43.960 --> 03:48.640]  it's confirmed in Brazil now this thing is in so many countries around the
[03:48.640 --> 03:52.960]  world now it's in Germany it's in Brazil it's in Croatia it's in Iraq it's in
[03:52.960 --> 03:57.480]  Israel it's spreading just like crazy uncontained a new outbreak hub of
[03:57.480 --> 04:00.960]  course in Italy over 300 cases they're confirmed yesterday this is not
[04:00.960 --> 04:05.480]  contained and everyone who was warned about the are not value of this which is
[04:05.480 --> 04:08.960]  how quickly it multiplies in the population everyone is being proven
[04:08.960 --> 04:13.000]  correct all the predictions that we made here on info wars calm are being
[04:13.000 --> 04:17.640]  proven correct and sadly I'll talk about this Rush Limbaugh is behind the curve
[04:17.640 --> 04:22.440]  on this but maybe we can help bring Rush up to speed he needs to get edged
[04:22.440 --> 04:26.000]  educated and President Trump needs to get educated so we're gonna cover the
[04:26.000 --> 04:31.400]  vaccine also six weeks away a vaccine testing in humans are you kidding me
[04:31.400 --> 04:35.160]  human trials already did they skip all the animal trials is there gonna be any
[04:35.160 --> 04:38.880]  quality control when they roll out a vaccine and are they going to criminalize
[04:38.880 --> 04:43.680]  anti-vaxxers and throw them in prison when they roll out a mandatory vaccine
[04:43.680 --> 04:46.920]  for the corona virus we'll answer all those questions and much more today here
[04:46.920 --> 04:50.320]  on the Alex Jones show this is Mike Adams stay with me one minute break we'll
[04:50.320 --> 04:53.880]  be back with all that news much more
[04:58.920 --> 05:03.560]  we know that the globalists are in trouble humanity's waking up to their
[05:03.560 --> 05:07.840]  tyranny how they run their scams their Ponzi schemes how they're building a
[05:07.840 --> 05:11.720]  post-human world but we know they're going to strike back and the UN has
[05:11.720 --> 05:16.480]  said that they're going to absolutely implode third-world countries and then
[05:16.480 --> 05:21.120]  use those giant populations as weaponized hordes to come in and
[05:21.120 --> 05:25.640]  overwhelm the West and collapse our social services in a giant clowered and
[05:25.640 --> 05:30.400]  pivot program the UN also has said they'll use mass plagues to make us
[05:30.400 --> 05:36.520]  capitulate to world government inner coronavirus this is a critical year and
[05:36.520 --> 05:41.400]  it's a critical time to stay informed and to be spreading the word because
[05:41.400 --> 05:45.800]  people are waking up like never before but this fight against tyranny is neck
[05:45.800 --> 05:50.920]  and neck so spread the word about band dot video and in full wars dot com for
[05:50.920 --> 05:56.960]  slash show that is so important you are at the center of the resistance you are
[05:56.960 --> 06:13.800]  our only hope from the frontlines of the information war it's Alex Jones this
[06:13.800 --> 06:19.080]  is one of the most important shows that you will ever see me hosting here on
[06:19.080 --> 06:23.120]  info wars dot com we've got professor Francis Boyle coming up at the top of
[06:23.120 --> 06:26.720]  the next hour Alex Jones himself will be popping in at the bottom of this
[06:26.720 --> 06:31.480]  hour with an update from Washington DC Judge Bergman and the Roger Stone
[06:31.480 --> 06:36.680]  trial all of that at the same time I've got bombshell news about the CDC setting
[06:36.680 --> 06:41.680]  a trap for Trump so well welcome to the show I'm Mike Adams the health ranger
[06:41.680 --> 06:45.840]  here from natural news and you are watching info wars dot com Alex Jones
[06:45.840 --> 06:50.040]  show the CDC is setting a trap for Trump that's the big headline for right now
[06:50.040 --> 06:54.880]  here's what we know so far the CDC sent out hundreds of thousands of test kits
[06:54.880 --> 06:59.880]  around February 5 we soon found out and this is mainstream news this was not
[06:59.880 --> 07:04.200]  some wacko theory we found out that those test kits did not work it was
[07:04.200 --> 07:08.600]  reported everywhere Wall Street Journal CNBC everywhere test kits did not work
[07:08.600 --> 07:12.560]  they produce false positives and false negatives at the same time it now
[07:12.560 --> 07:17.520]  appears the CDC was ordering states not to conduct their own tests and that's
[07:17.520 --> 07:25.080]  why to date only 426 tests for the coronavirus have been made nationwide and
[07:25.080 --> 07:29.960]  that those are CDC figures that I double-checked as of this morning CDC
[07:29.960 --> 07:34.240]  official website you can go I mean pull it up CDC official website on the
[07:34.240 --> 07:38.440]  coronavirus currently says or at least as of this morning it said 426 tests
[07:38.440 --> 07:43.280]  nationwide that's it California the testing that they have quote done for
[07:43.280 --> 07:47.480]  the coronavirus they sent them to Atlanta the CDC did the testing I had
[07:47.480 --> 07:52.440]  staffers research the public health websites of all 50 states basically
[07:52.440 --> 07:57.760]  almost none of them report any in-state testing there is virtually no testing
[07:57.760 --> 08:01.840]  happening anywhere in America in fact I've got a story here here it is this is
[08:01.840 --> 08:07.880]  CNBC from yesterday only three US states can test for coronavirus says public
[08:07.880 --> 08:12.520]  lab group this is the Association of Public Health Laboratories APHL
[08:12.520 --> 08:17.040]  they're saying that no one's testing for this and the CDC is prohibiting people
[08:17.040 --> 08:21.880]  from testing for it while the CDC is apparently this is my theory withholding
[08:21.880 --> 08:27.400]  test kits so that no one tests for community outbreaks in America how are
[08:27.400 --> 08:31.240]  you supposed to know if there's an outbreak if you're not testing for one
[08:31.240 --> 08:36.400]  and then you have Dr. Nancy Messonnier from the CDC who's a very interesting
[08:36.400 --> 08:41.440]  person reported to be the sister of Rob Rosenstein now I haven't confirmed that
[08:41.440 --> 08:45.440]  yet but I saw that on zero hedge and a couple other places that may be the case
[08:45.440 --> 08:50.240]  but she is the one who said the test kits are broken they don't work and now
[08:50.240 --> 08:53.680]  she's quoted in the Wall Street Journal I'll have quotes from her right here
[08:53.680 --> 08:58.160]  quote now is the time for businesses hospitals communities schools and
[08:58.160 --> 09:02.560]  everyday people to begin preparing we are asking the American public to work
[09:02.560 --> 09:08.720]  with us to prepare for the expectation that this could be bad here we go we do
[09:08.720 --> 09:15.440]  have confirmation Rob Rosenstein's sister is the CDC's Dr. Nancy Messonnier so
[09:15.440 --> 09:20.120]  yeah thank thank you for that so now the plot thickens folks the plot thickens
[09:20.120 --> 09:24.040]  how many agendas are flying around on all this you've got President Trump that
[09:24.040 --> 09:27.720]  says everything's fine he's gonna address the nation tonight at 6 p.m. and
[09:27.720 --> 09:31.160]  he's gonna tell people at least reportedly he's going to say don't worry
[09:31.160 --> 09:35.240]  the CDC has us under control the WHO has us under control we're working on a
[09:35.240 --> 09:38.000]  vaccine everything's gonna be fine there's no evidence of any outbreaks in
[09:38.000 --> 09:40.880]  America Rush Limbaugh is out there we're gonna talk about him a little bit
[09:40.880 --> 09:46.400]  today Rush Limbaugh says there's no problem this is just the flu we need to
[09:46.400 --> 09:49.760]  get rush up to speed on this we'll talk about that in a minute rush is a great
[09:49.760 --> 09:54.880]  American hero but he's not yet up to speed on this then you've got that Dr.
[09:54.880 --> 09:59.840]  Nancy Messonnier at the CDC the sister of Rob Rosenstein saying this thing's
[09:59.840 --> 10:04.320]  coming to America schools and hospitals get ready the test kits have failed
[10:04.320 --> 10:08.080]  there's no testing taking place anywhere across the country the lab
[10:08.080 --> 10:13.320]  Association of America is saying FDA give us permission to test for corona
[10:13.320 --> 10:17.920]  virus because there's no testing being done and then Nancy Messonnier says we
[10:17.920 --> 10:22.320]  don't have any evidence of any outbreaks in America she didn't say we don't have
[10:22.320 --> 10:27.120]  any outbreaks in America she said we don't have any evidence of outbreaks in
[10:27.120 --> 10:31.120]  America you understand the difference because there's no testing being done no
[10:31.120 --> 10:36.400]  testing being done meanwhile a reliable source of mine from the Department of
[10:36.400 --> 10:42.280]  Homeland Security told me days ago that they already have confirmation of 989
[10:42.280 --> 10:49.640]  confirmed infections on a map known to Homeland Security from a week ago and if
[10:49.640 --> 10:53.560]  this thing with an r not value of estimated up to 6.6 if this thing
[10:53.560 --> 10:59.160]  doubles every what 3.5 days or so that means it's doubled twice in the last
[10:59.160 --> 11:04.400]  week 1,000 infections in America that were known over a week ago could be 4,000
[11:04.400 --> 11:09.160]  infections right now and that's assuming that they caught every infection so I
[11:09.160 --> 11:14.720]  believe realistically mathematically we have over 4,000 infections in America
[11:14.720 --> 11:20.080]  right now and yesterday we had a super secret classified briefing before the
[11:20.080 --> 11:25.720]  United States Senate and NIH was briefing senators and the CDC and
[11:25.720 --> 11:31.440]  Homeland Security classified briefing whoa why does this have to be a secret if
[11:31.440 --> 11:36.560]  it's all good news why can't you make it public why can't you just say a public
[11:36.560 --> 11:40.800]  hearing hey senators everything's fine there will be no outbreaks in America
[11:40.800 --> 11:45.560]  everything's awesome everybody buy more stocks proceed as normal but no it's a
[11:45.560 --> 11:50.160]  super secret hearing so it's classified what are they telling them that's
[11:50.160 --> 11:55.600]  classified and I have an educated theory on this point and I'm going to share
[11:55.600 --> 12:01.200]  that with you right now we have four minutes on this here we go here's my
[12:01.200 --> 12:05.200]  theory can't prove it yet but here's what I think has happened I believe the
[12:05.200 --> 12:10.440]  United States of America has already been subjected to a bio weapons attack
[12:10.440 --> 12:16.480]  that enemies of America which include China Iran which has the virus North
[12:16.480 --> 12:21.600]  Korea and perhaps other nations that they've already harvested this they've
[12:21.600 --> 12:26.320]  already incubated it multiplied it which is easy to do in egg yolks and they've
[12:26.320 --> 12:31.360]  already released it in American cities that's my theory I can't prove it it's
[12:31.360 --> 12:34.560]  an educated theory it's something I talked about weeks ago probably
[12:34.560 --> 12:38.760]  happening I believe based on the evidence we're seeing right now that the
[12:38.760 --> 12:43.560]  Department of Homeland Security is aware that a bioterrorism attack has taken
[12:43.560 --> 12:48.640]  place against America that human weapons with this virus have been
[12:48.640 --> 12:53.920]  unleashed in US cities by flying to America from nations where we don't
[12:53.920 --> 12:59.200]  have a travel ban again I caution you I can't prove this yet this is a well
[12:59.200 --> 13:03.960]  educated estimation of what might be happening and that explains the super
[13:03.960 --> 13:11.200]  secret classified hearing and I believe that these officials from the CDC and the
[13:11.200 --> 13:15.560]  NIH I believe that they're telling the senators this is going to have outbreaks
[13:15.560 --> 13:20.400]  in America we can't control it it's broken containment and we're going to
[13:20.400 --> 13:24.360]  have to have medical martial law we're going to have to have quarantines in
[13:24.360 --> 13:28.920]  America and I believe these officials are asking the senators please senators
[13:28.920 --> 13:35.280]  tell us what should we do because you can't even say this news to the American
[13:35.280 --> 13:39.480]  people without I suppose putting them in a state of shock since nobody's
[13:39.480 --> 13:43.280]  prepared for anything the average American has less than $400 in in terms
[13:43.280 --> 13:46.720]  of backup money for an emergency they don't have backup food supplies they
[13:46.720 --> 13:50.040]  don't have backup medicine there's no vaccine ready there's no drug proven to
[13:50.040 --> 13:55.080]  treat this and the stock market is overbought and we don't want to see the
[13:55.080 --> 13:59.080]  stock market crash even though Democrats want to crash it what are these
[13:59.080 --> 14:03.960]  officials going to do now if you think that that's that that case is not
[14:03.960 --> 14:07.440]  happening maybe you say okay Mike you're taking it too far it's not a
[14:07.440 --> 14:12.160]  bioterrorism attack yet it's just an outbreak okay it's just an outbreak it's
[14:12.160 --> 14:16.120]  an outbreak in America then the CDC knows the outbreak is happening the NIH
[14:16.120 --> 14:21.760]  knows it what are we supposed to do then I think it's a trap for Trump I think
[14:21.760 --> 14:26.480]  Trump is being kept out of the loop I think Trump is being misinformed on
[14:26.480 --> 14:31.160]  purpose so that they can blame Trump when the testing begins remember the
[14:31.160 --> 14:34.680]  testing has not even begun in America when the testing begins we're gonna see
[14:34.680 --> 14:38.720]  hundreds if not thousands of cases almost immediately confirmed Trump is
[14:38.720 --> 14:41.720]  going to take the blame you're gonna see Mitt Romney up there saying ah Trump was
[14:41.720 --> 14:45.640]  unprepared he doesn't know what he's doing you're gonna have senator Schumer
[14:45.640 --> 14:49.600]  saying a Trump took money away from the CDC which is a lie he didn't do that oh
[14:49.600 --> 14:54.400]  Trump didn't have enough funding he just approved I think was it a billion or
[14:54.400 --> 14:58.480]  two billion or 2.5 billion the number keeps jumping around but Trump just
[14:58.480 --> 15:01.560]  approved that apparently or at least a request from the White House to have
[15:01.560 --> 15:07.960]  more funding for this Trump is going to get blamed and he in my opinion even
[15:07.960 --> 15:13.280]  though I'm a Trump supporter and I hope Trump wins in November Trump is putting
[15:13.280 --> 15:17.720]  his political future at risk by downplaying the severity of this
[15:17.720 --> 15:22.280]  outblit outbreak and I don't even know exactly what Trump is supposed to say
[15:22.280 --> 15:28.520]  to America what do you say oh the the stock markets overbought pandemic
[15:28.520 --> 15:33.120]  outbreaks are coming we don't have a vaccine and maybe China just attacked
[15:33.120 --> 15:37.840]  us well how do you how do you say that to America so I don't know what Trump is
[15:37.840 --> 15:42.840]  supposed to do he's in a real bind but we'll we'll try to help you survive it
[15:42.840 --> 15:46.000]  here at info wars.com we're going to break right now we'll come back with a
[15:46.000 --> 15:49.520]  lot more straight ahead on Mike Adams thank you for watching we're gonna talk
[15:49.520 --> 15:54.760]  about Rush Limbaugh too when we come back info wars.com Alex Jones show stay

[18:58.000 --> 19:02.320]  want to talk about super silver whitening toothpaste because I hadn't tried it
[19:02.320 --> 19:06.800]  except for maybe the last week and a half and I told Alex I said man this is
[19:06.800 --> 19:09.680]  the best toothpaste I've ever tried he's like well what are you doing just
[19:09.680 --> 19:13.000]  sitting in here telling me you got to get up there and tell people and so here
[19:13.000 --> 19:17.880]  I am telling people super silver whitening toothpaste is by far the best
[19:17.880 --> 19:21.720]  toothpaste I've ever tried and I'm 45 years old and I've tried a lot of
[19:21.720 --> 19:26.280]  different toothpaste and it's fluoride free I think the big difference the game
[19:26.280 --> 19:29.960]  changer in this is the coral calcium because after I brush my teeth with this
[19:29.960 --> 19:34.160]  they feel so clean and the toothpaste that I don't even like rinse out my
[19:34.160 --> 19:39.000]  mouth after I brush my teeth at this it feels so good it feels like it feels
[19:39.000 --> 19:43.000]  like good things are happening in my mouth in fact I brought I find myself
[19:43.000 --> 19:47.480]  brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now
[19:47.480 --> 20:02.120]  because I like the way it feels
[20:02.120 --> 20:23.480]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[20:23.480 --> 20:29.760]  there's a sick congressman from Illinois in DC he was in Chicago over the
[20:29.760 --> 20:35.720]  holiday they're using the pod to fly him home then they're closing down midway
[20:35.720 --> 20:38.880]  and O'Hare the governor there is calling out the National Guard they're
[20:38.880 --> 20:42.280]  setting up roadblocks they're shutting down the board of trade public
[20:42.280 --> 20:45.560]  transportation even the teamsters are pulling their drivers off the road
[20:45.560 --> 20:48.720]  people are still going to slip through you know yes they will the Secret
[20:48.720 --> 20:53.080]  Service is moving the president underground congress is figuring out how
[20:53.080 --> 20:59.680]  to work online when the word goes out there will be a run on the banks gas
[20:59.680 --> 21:03.520]  stations grocery stores you name it people will panic the virus will be the
[21:03.520 --> 21:07.840]  least of our worries it will tip over now we just need to make sure that nobody
[21:07.840 --> 21:14.480]  knows until everybody knows that's from the movie contagion the last line there
[21:14.480 --> 21:20.880]  we just need to make sure nobody knows until everybody knows wow what
[21:20.880 --> 21:25.680]  foreshadowing of current events just an incredible film to watch their contagion
[21:25.680 --> 21:30.440]  I believe from the year 2011 notably the hero of the movie contagion was of
[21:30.440 --> 21:36.680]  course the vaccine and the bad guy in the movie played by Jude Law was someone
[21:36.680 --> 21:42.400]  who promoted herbs and someone who was you might call them today an anti-vaxxer
[21:42.400 --> 21:46.840]  played by Jude Law and they even put false teeth in his mouth to give him
[21:46.840 --> 21:51.480]  kind of a crooked buck tooth look to say that oh these herb people these
[21:51.480 --> 21:55.960]  anti-vaxx people are a little bit crazy and they have messed up teeth and they
[21:55.960 --> 22:00.640]  look funny and and at the end of the movie he was indicted criminally
[22:00.640 --> 22:06.720]  indicted because he made money selling an herb when the vaccine was the hero of
[22:06.720 --> 22:12.120]  the film so of course a total setup for exactly what we're seeing today now we
[22:12.120 --> 22:16.680]  we've got so much information here one thing I want to mention you've heard of
[22:16.680 --> 22:22.400]  the are not value it's are followed by a subscript zero it's called are not and
[22:22.400 --> 22:26.160]  the are not value according to mainstream science describes the
[22:26.160 --> 22:31.200]  characteristics of the multiplying effect of the virus how many people it
[22:31.200 --> 22:36.240]  spreads to for every one person that has it so if one person spreads it to three
[22:36.240 --> 22:41.240]  people it's called an are not value of three this virus is believed to have an
[22:41.240 --> 22:46.520]  are not value of six point six according to some research which is through the roof
[22:46.520 --> 22:50.480]  and this is explaining why we have so many outbreaks happening in Italy and
[22:50.480 --> 22:55.480]  around the world in fact if we can go to this map right now we've got 1261 in
[22:55.480 --> 23:01.760]  South Korea now just exploding there Italy confirmed 374 cases off the charts
[23:01.760 --> 23:08.440]  sustained human to human transmission in Italy Japan 178 and Iran just leaping
[23:08.440 --> 23:14.160]  at 139 Singapore seems to be doing a good job right now Taiwan is doing a good
[23:14.160 --> 23:17.560]  job I don't trust the numbers out of Thailand and I don't trust the numbers
[23:17.560 --> 23:21.320]  in the United States I think the US has thousands of cases but they're just not
[23:21.320 --> 23:26.200]  yet tested for because of course there are no testing kits available but I
[23:26.200 --> 23:30.040]  have a new theory because I like to interject a little bit of satire into
[23:30.040 --> 23:35.400]  all this I think the are not value has a new alternative definition you talk
[23:35.400 --> 23:41.560]  about are not here's here's what I think it should mean if you keep waiting you
[23:41.560 --> 23:47.360]  are not gonna be able to buy food if if you don't don't take action you are not
[23:47.360 --> 23:51.360]  gonna be able to make it through this pandemic that that's my version of the
[23:51.360 --> 23:56.160]  are not value you are not gonna be helped by the federal government you are
[23:56.160 --> 24:01.360]  not gonna want FEMA at your door with a gun telling you to go to a FEMA camp so
[24:01.360 --> 24:07.640]  that's I'm gonna call this the are not sale if you need food supplies right now
[24:07.640 --> 24:11.920]  my Patriot supply is about the only place in America that's got any food left
[24:11.920 --> 24:16.520]  and it's at infowarstore.com in fact last night a friend of mine who
[24:16.520 --> 24:21.200]  runs another major online retailer he called me just about in a panic and he
[24:21.200 --> 24:25.600]  said all these companies that he had bought from like Mountain House they
[24:25.600 --> 24:28.480]  make like the freeze-dried camping food that you buy at Walmart he said they're
[24:28.480 --> 24:31.400]  just they're wiped out these other companies are wiped out he said he just
[24:31.400 --> 24:35.960]  bought $50,000 worth of food from another supplier to try to fulfill his
[24:35.960 --> 24:39.800]  customer orders and he said that's it they're done and these other companies
[24:39.800 --> 24:44.000]  are not even taking orders anymore they're out our own health ranger store is
[24:44.000 --> 24:47.840]  out of food we're waiting on supplies right now we can't get any more food at
[24:47.840 --> 24:55.200]  the moment infowarstore.com has the food my Patriot supply has the food and I
[24:55.200 --> 25:00.960]  know I mean yeah it's it's storeable food it's got a long shelf life and if
[25:00.960 --> 25:06.720]  people are asking me like are you are you gonna eat this food yourself if it's
[25:06.720 --> 25:10.960]  that versus starving you bet I am I'm not gonna go out to my backyard and just
[25:10.960 --> 25:14.640]  cut grass and juice grass and try to drink wheat grass all through the
[25:14.640 --> 25:19.280]  pandemic I'd love to have some food and if you want to have some food just take
[25:19.280 --> 25:23.640]  advantage of this are not sale that's what I'm calling it's it's it's it's a
[25:23.640 --> 25:27.520]  joke it's a play on the on the are not term but infowarstore.com get your food
[25:27.520 --> 25:32.440]  supplies right now there's gonna come a day in America where you can't get
[25:32.440 --> 25:37.240]  anything that day is coming Nancy Messonnier even warned about that if you
[25:37.240 --> 25:40.440]  believe what she's saying I'll talk about that a little bit more in a second
[25:40.440 --> 25:45.280]  in Italy one day everything was fine you could go to the store you could get
[25:45.280 --> 25:49.680]  supplies and then suddenly overnight in Italy because of all those infections
[25:49.680 --> 25:54.480]  again now 374 confirmed infections now you can't get any supplies because you
[25:54.480 --> 26:01.120]  can't travel they locked down 10 or 12 towns in Italy overnight armed road
[26:01.120 --> 26:07.640]  blocks police with submachine guns on the roads in Italy you think that can't
[26:07.640 --> 26:14.520]  happen in America of course it can in fact I think it's it's inevitable now
[26:14.520 --> 26:21.000]  we're gonna talk about Russia limbo for just a second here a very amazing caller
[26:21.000 --> 26:25.800]  called into Russia's show yesterday and I don't know who this caller is but I
[26:25.800 --> 26:30.560]  thank the person he's well spoken and he mentioned me let's go to that clip and
[26:30.560 --> 26:35.080]  see what he said and what Russia's response was go ahead news.com the
[26:35.080 --> 26:38.880]  gentleman's name is Mike Adams I don't know if this is credible but he claims
[26:38.880 --> 26:46.440]  to be using US government and CDC and other US government websites and and
[26:46.440 --> 26:53.520]  statistics to prove all his points and he's got a background in in pandemics
[26:53.520 --> 27:01.160]  or in science and health so he's saying as of yesterday that there's hardly any
[27:01.160 --> 27:08.200]  testing going on in the US so therefore we don't really know how many people in
[27:08.200 --> 27:14.600]  the US have this or how serious it is and the CDC kits are not reliable I'm
[27:14.600 --> 27:19.240]  not really sure if this is to be believed and then we don't yet have a handle
[27:19.240 --> 27:24.680]  on this I can't I can't I can't help you because I never heard of the guy I mean I
[27:24.680 --> 27:30.200]  know a lot of Mike Adams I don't know this guy on this website I can't help
[27:30.200 --> 27:37.120]  you these are the kind of things that they're a challenge everybody wants to
[27:37.120 --> 27:41.760]  know more than what is being reported on something and you glom on the if you're
[27:41.760 --> 27:45.280]  worried and scared and if you think this is going to be bad and you run across a
[27:45.280 --> 27:49.600]  site that confirms your fears then you tend to believe them so that's that's
[27:49.600 --> 27:53.400]  Rush Limbaugh commenting first of all I thank that caller I don't know the caller
[27:53.400 --> 27:58.520]  and this was not an arranged call from from me I thank the caller for asking
[27:58.520 --> 28:02.800]  the question I just want to point out that the caller it was very accurate in
[28:02.800 --> 28:06.920]  their description that I'm citing the CDC and the state of California and the
[28:06.920 --> 28:10.160]  state of Washington the state of Hawaii that there's no testing virtually going
[28:10.160 --> 28:16.080]  on in America now Rush Limbaugh look he Rush Limbaugh is a living legend I'm a
[28:16.080 --> 28:20.480]  subscriber to Rush 24-7 I pay to listen to Rush Limbaugh I've listened to his
[28:20.480 --> 28:26.000]  show for years Rush Limbaugh is a great American he just had the presidential
[28:26.000 --> 28:31.360]  Medal of Freedom awarded to him and and he earned it but Rush Limbaugh needs to
[28:31.360 --> 28:34.640]  get up to speed on this he doesn't yet have the information that he needs and I
[28:34.640 --> 28:39.400]  believe Rush has a responsibility to get better information about this so that
[28:39.400 --> 28:43.480]  he can inform his audience I'm a fan of Rush but he's behind the curve on this
[28:43.480 --> 28:47.200]  issue he's not a scientist he's a brilliant analyst in the world of
[28:47.200 --> 28:51.480]  politics but he doesn't know what's happening with this exponential spread
[28:51.480 --> 28:57.480]  of the virus I pray for you Rush but please get educated we'll be right back

[33:02.160 --> 33:12.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:12.680 --> 33:15.360]  Waging war on corruption.
[33:15.360 --> 33:20.680]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[33:20.680 --> 33:27.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live broadcasting worldwide.
[33:27.280 --> 33:32.160]  I am Alex Jones, your host, coming to you from deep in the heart of the swamp that is
[33:32.160 --> 33:37.760]  beginning to show signs of drainage from crocodiles and alligators and adicondas and
[33:37.760 --> 33:45.080]  piranhas are not pleased, I can tell you that Mike Adams is doing an exemplary job running
[33:45.080 --> 33:48.480]  the ship when we got to the sea last night.
[33:48.480 --> 33:52.600]  I thought, let me tune into the rebroadcast because it's about to restart on the streams
[33:52.600 --> 34:00.440]  and I ended up watching two hours of Mike Adams and Alan Keyes and G. Edward Griffin.
[34:00.440 --> 34:05.280]  And then this morning I watched, got to 5 a.m., watched some of Paul Watson.
[34:05.280 --> 34:12.400]  So out of the park broadcast yesterday, I really want to thank Mike Adams and Dr. Keyes
[34:12.400 --> 34:17.000]  for the amazing job that they engaged in yesterday.
[34:17.000 --> 34:23.680]  Obviously, now the federal government says get food and prepare to shelter in place.
[34:23.680 --> 34:28.800]  Whether this virus is super deadly or not, as we keep saying, the giant response to it
[34:28.800 --> 34:34.440]  and the martial law in Russia where they're raiding Chinese and dragging them out and
[34:34.440 --> 34:39.000]  martial law in Northern Italy, the response is massive.
[34:39.000 --> 34:43.840]  And obviously it's being used to drive down the economy and try to derail nationalism.
[34:43.840 --> 34:44.840]  The globalists have always said that.
[34:44.840 --> 34:47.440]  I want to get Mike Adams' take on that right now.
[34:47.440 --> 34:53.880]  I know he's already been extensively talking about it, but I wanted to first get into this.
[34:53.880 --> 35:02.960]  Amy Jackson, the federal judge who was appointed especially by Obama to sit at the center of
[35:02.960 --> 35:07.320]  the spider web in D.C. so they could send cases from all over the country that she was
[35:07.320 --> 35:11.360]  going to cover up a corruption or cover up crimes to her.
[35:11.360 --> 35:17.840]  But she could also then prosecute and persecute people like Roger Stone.
[35:17.840 --> 35:26.680]  She has been caught one trillion infinities in the most classic hand in the cookie jar
[35:26.680 --> 35:31.240]  stealing justice away from people that has ever been seen.
[35:31.240 --> 35:38.360]  She literally put in a jury forewoman who was the communications director for the office
[35:38.360 --> 35:45.200]  of White House Communications, a major position as the first jury woman whose husband worked
[35:45.200 --> 35:49.880]  in the Robert Mueller probe as a lawyer on the Russiagate.
[35:49.880 --> 35:51.920]  That is beyond Fox and the Henhouse.
[35:51.920 --> 35:56.680]  That'd be like Hitler presiding over the Nuremberg trials against the Nazis or let's
[35:56.680 --> 36:02.200]  say my ex-wife was a judge, but she's not, but imagine if I was in a divorce and the
[36:02.200 --> 36:06.000]  judge is your wife.
[36:06.000 --> 36:07.920]  It's beyond conflict of interest.
[36:07.920 --> 36:12.440]  It's redonkulous, it is so obscene.
[36:12.440 --> 36:17.560]  So I talked to reporters, they were all scared to say it, but I said give me the name, I'll
[36:17.560 --> 36:22.200]  say it, because I went to check with lawyers, but I already knew before I called them.
[36:22.200 --> 36:25.680]  Juries are always public, especially after.
[36:25.680 --> 36:31.000]  Women in mafia trials may be in super hardcore, MS-13 threatened to kill people, threatened
[36:31.000 --> 36:32.000]  to kill jurors.
[36:32.000 --> 36:36.880]  Sometimes there's special lawments where the jurors aren't public till afterwards.
[36:36.880 --> 36:39.280]  But then we exposed it.
[36:39.280 --> 36:44.960]  The Washington Post had Obama officials calling for our arrest, Obama former U.S. attorneys.
[36:44.960 --> 36:45.960]  Total BS.
[36:45.960 --> 36:49.120]  Just like they said arrest anybody, arrest Senator Rand Paul for saying Eric Sierra
[36:49.120 --> 36:50.120]  Mahler's name.
[36:50.120 --> 36:51.840]  Totally legal, totally lawful.
[36:51.840 --> 36:55.480]  When a whistleblower goes to the inspector general, they can't release it.
[36:55.480 --> 36:59.720]  Just like when I go to the hospital, they can't release my HIPAA stuff.
[36:59.720 --> 37:03.160]  But then if I go out on national TV and say I've got some illness, well, that's not the
[37:03.160 --> 37:05.320]  hospital releasing HIPAA info.
[37:05.320 --> 37:10.400]  When you accuse the president of crimes, now he gets to face his accuser called due process.
[37:10.400 --> 37:15.240]  So we all know about that and the fake stuff that happened with the FISA court, with all
[37:15.240 --> 37:19.560]  of the fake info they were given, the FISA court has said they were lied to by all these
[37:19.560 --> 37:25.120]  Obama and Hillary Justice Department appointees and operatives inside the FBI.
[37:25.120 --> 37:27.480]  We all know about that ad nauseum.
[37:27.480 --> 37:31.320]  But they thought President Trump would be removed by now.
[37:31.320 --> 37:37.080]  They thought they were going to get rid of him and then they would have the sentencing
[37:37.080 --> 37:42.480]  of stone as another chairing on top legitimizing what they'd done.
[37:42.480 --> 37:46.280]  The best laid plans of my some men often go astray.
[37:46.280 --> 37:51.640]  That didn't work the way they wanted it to at all.
[37:51.640 --> 37:55.040]  So now Russiagate blows up, falls apart.
[37:55.040 --> 37:56.880]  Ukraine gate falls apart.
[37:56.880 --> 38:02.880]  Now we know that she, after we exposed the jury for woman that she had put in, it was
[38:02.880 --> 38:07.160]  in the transcript, it turns out, in front of the media three months ago.
[38:07.160 --> 38:10.800]  The woman says, yeah, I worked for Obama, headed up a department.
[38:10.800 --> 38:13.240]  My husband works for Justice Department.
[38:13.240 --> 38:16.200]  And she's like, no problem, no big deal, no problem.
[38:16.200 --> 38:18.040]  We get the name.
[38:18.040 --> 38:19.040]  She headed up a department.
[38:19.040 --> 38:21.920]  Her husband was high level on the Mueller probe, unbelievable.
[38:21.920 --> 38:26.640]  So they finally have to remove her, they get the new jury for woman.
[38:26.640 --> 38:32.800]  Dona Brazil protégé ran for national and high office, Democrat Party operative has
[38:32.800 --> 38:36.520]  worked for the DNC, the DNC.
[38:36.520 --> 38:37.520]  That is unbelievable.
[38:37.520 --> 38:43.320]  It'd be like putting Sylvester in charge of Tweety Bird's care.
[38:43.320 --> 38:48.400]  No one has ever acted like this, not even third world kangaroo courts in Venezuela.
[38:48.400 --> 38:51.040]  This is unbelievable.
[38:51.040 --> 38:55.240]  But see, they thought Trump would be gone by now, so they thought they had the media.
[38:55.240 --> 38:57.440]  They thought they could get away with this.
[38:57.440 --> 39:03.200]  So I went and Bullhorn drove around four times over an hour and a half period around the
[39:03.200 --> 39:04.200]  federal courthouse.
[39:04.200 --> 39:05.600]  She's reportedly there today.
[39:05.600 --> 39:09.800]  And then I went on the front steps in Bullhorn for another 30 minutes with everybody looking
[39:09.800 --> 39:15.240]  out the windows at us and pointed out that you've been caught committing a major crime.
[39:15.240 --> 39:16.240]  But it gets worse.
[39:16.240 --> 39:21.800]  Back when we exposed it, she told the people in the courtroom and the media, you do not
[39:21.800 --> 39:22.800]  cover this.
[39:22.800 --> 39:25.960]  You do not tell anybody about this.
[39:25.960 --> 39:27.880]  You don't say the names of these juries.
[39:27.880 --> 39:30.920]  Well, she doesn't have that power.
[39:30.920 --> 39:34.320]  So then we put the information out, then we learn about the new lady.
[39:34.320 --> 39:39.280]  Now she doesn't, here's the key to everything I should have gotten to up front.
[39:39.280 --> 39:42.480]  The judge is a deer in the headlights.
[39:42.480 --> 39:46.560]  She is trying to suppress the names of the other jurors and their jury questionnaires
[39:46.560 --> 39:51.640]  now, even from the lawyers, even though that's part of the record, even the Supreme Court
[39:51.640 --> 39:55.800]  has ruled that should all be public information because it's going to come out that more of
[39:55.800 --> 40:01.840]  them are Democrat party operatives and more of them are globalist.
[40:01.840 --> 40:05.280]  And so not one, not two, it's going to be a lot more.
[40:05.280 --> 40:09.680]  And the transcripts of the judge saying, it's okay if you work for the DNC.
[40:09.680 --> 40:11.680]  It's okay if you work for Obama.
[40:11.680 --> 40:14.760]  And then they lied on the questionnaires and said, oh, I don't even know who Roger Stone
[40:14.760 --> 40:15.760]  is.
[40:15.760 --> 40:18.400]  Meanwhile, before they said they hated him, during the trial they said he's going to
[40:18.400 --> 40:19.560]  go to jail.
[40:19.560 --> 40:24.960]  So we've caught them red-handed, the judge protecting it, a giant criminal operation
[40:24.960 --> 40:29.200]  because she was under orders by Obama and Hillary and the deep state to carry this out.
[40:29.200 --> 40:33.160]  And now the wheels are totally coming off and these massive crimes that they've committed
[40:33.160 --> 40:35.680]  are just devastatingly insane.
[40:35.680 --> 40:38.080]  And Trump is tweeting and talking about it.
[40:38.080 --> 40:40.560]  And the judge says, that's intimidation of jurors.
[40:40.560 --> 40:43.880]  She talked about me yesterday and said, I'm trying to intimidate jurors.
[40:43.880 --> 40:47.840]  The jury already rendered their fraudulent verdict.
[40:47.840 --> 40:49.440]  They're already gone.
[40:49.440 --> 40:51.160]  It's dissolved.
[40:51.160 --> 40:58.600]  So how the hell is it intimidating jurors to talk about a jury that isn't even there
[40:58.600 --> 40:59.600]  anymore?
[40:59.600 --> 41:00.600]  It's total crap.
[41:00.600 --> 41:04.240]  She's desperate to cover up her crimes and doesn't want the jurors talking about how
[41:04.240 --> 41:08.240]  they're all DNC operatives and how much trouble these criminals are going to get in.
[41:08.240 --> 41:10.600]  They have really bitten off more than they could chew.
[41:10.600 --> 41:14.800]  I want to play some of the clips with Andrew Napolitano and Tucker Carlson next segment
[41:14.800 --> 41:18.440]  getting into this and finish up with the latest coronavirus news before Dr. Francis
[41:18.440 --> 41:22.840]  Boyle, the author of the US Biological Weapons Convention, who's been dead on this whole
[41:22.840 --> 41:26.720]  time about being man-made and it's more deadly than what they're saying.
[41:26.720 --> 41:28.520]  Looks like he's been proven right in spades.
[41:28.520 --> 41:34.240]  But Mike Adams, this is bigger than just this Judge Jackson, Amy Bergman Jackson.
[41:34.240 --> 41:37.520]  This is their whole house of cards coming down, just like the FISA court.
[41:37.520 --> 41:41.440]  I don't know how the Justice Department doesn't prosecute this witch-like creature.
[41:41.440 --> 41:46.480]  Well, it's very clear that they have to control the narrative in order to prevent their people
[41:46.480 --> 41:47.680]  from going to jail.
[41:47.680 --> 41:51.600]  If justice has really served in this country, then there's a whole long list of people that
[41:51.600 --> 41:56.640]  go to jail, especially those who signed the fraudulent FISA court documents that began
[41:56.640 --> 42:01.160]  the entire investigation into people like Roger Stone and other Trump affiliates, even
[42:01.160 --> 42:03.280]  though Stone wasn't officially on the campaign.
[42:03.280 --> 42:05.360]  So yeah, this is the house of cards.
[42:05.360 --> 42:09.760]  And by the way, they are trying to use this pandemic, Alex, to take out Trump.
[42:09.760 --> 42:12.360]  And that's, I don't know if you heard the opening segment, that's what I'm warning
[42:12.360 --> 42:13.360]  about today.
[42:13.360 --> 42:16.280]  They, you know, of course, they're not going to let a crisis go to waste.
[42:16.280 --> 42:19.600]  Everything that they can use to destroy Trump, they will use, and they're going to use this
[42:19.600 --> 42:20.600]  too.
[42:20.600 --> 42:21.840]  That's, that's the big warning today.
[42:21.840 --> 42:25.400]  So we've got to reach Trump and educate him about this, what's really going on, how the
[42:25.400 --> 42:27.280]  CDC is lying to him.
[42:27.280 --> 42:28.280]  Absolutely.
[42:28.280 --> 42:31.840]  And I understand that Trump doesn't want to hype something up that can hurt the economy.
[42:31.840 --> 42:35.640]  I believe we are going to make it through this virus, but it's manmade.
[42:35.640 --> 42:36.640]  It's a chimera.
[42:36.640 --> 42:40.760]  Obama, again, can't make this up, sold it to China five years ago.
[42:40.760 --> 42:41.760]  He authorized it.
[42:41.760 --> 42:45.920]  It was in the Scientist magazine, it was in the news, the scientific community said this
[42:45.920 --> 42:46.920]  is crazy.
[42:46.920 --> 42:47.920]  What are you doing?
[42:47.920 --> 42:48.920]  We're going to break Alex.
[42:48.920 --> 42:50.240]  Let's, we'll be right back after this break.
[42:50.240 --> 42:51.240]  Stay with us.
[42:51.240 --> 42:53.320]  Alex Jones, Mike Adams, and Francis Boyle coming up.
[42:53.320 --> 42:58.160]  Stay with us.
[42:58.160 --> 43:04.800]  At the end of World War II, Adolf Hitler had discredited the eugenics and world population
[43:04.800 --> 43:06.600]  control organizations.
[43:06.600 --> 43:12.040]  They openly had meetings and led by Julian Huxley, all this Huxley's brother, decided
[43:12.040 --> 43:15.760]  to repackage themselves as transhumanists.
[43:15.760 --> 43:22.680]  Now in the year 2020, to set the precedent that people can be turned into cyborgs, that
[43:22.680 --> 43:27.920]  robots can be given rights, you name it, they are intimidating and arresting people all
[43:27.920 --> 43:32.440]  over the world who simply misgender someone.
[43:32.440 --> 43:38.880]  So the ultimate crime will be even asking what someone is if you can't even tell what
[43:38.880 --> 43:40.080]  they are.
[43:40.080 --> 43:45.880]  This is the ultimate Kafka-esque mind control, and there's several big articles up on infowars.com
[43:45.880 --> 43:47.400]  that break this down.
[43:47.400 --> 43:52.960]  UK teen fine under house arrest for asking trans police officers, gender, UK mother,
[43:52.960 --> 43:58.360]  spare jail for misgenerating trans woman, order to pay 1,000 pound fine.
[43:58.360 --> 44:01.160]  All right, folks, here's the bad news.
[44:01.160 --> 44:05.760]  We've already sold out of the 16 ounce immune gargle with the patented nanotech silver that's
[44:05.760 --> 44:09.880]  documented to knock out viruses and bacteria unlike anything else.
[44:09.880 --> 44:13.840]  But we do still have it in the three ounce and the one ounce for limited time.
[44:13.840 --> 44:20.120]  The good news is we have the super blue toothpaste and the super silver toothpaste, both that
[44:20.120 --> 44:22.400]  have the nano silver in them as well.
[44:22.400 --> 44:28.240]  The super blue has tea tree that's also antiviral and antibacterial and high quality iodine.
[44:28.240 --> 44:31.960]  And then of course, the whitening has the nano silver, but on top of that, it has the
[44:31.960 --> 44:35.640]  above sea coral calcium that remelanorizes the teeth.
[44:35.640 --> 44:38.760]  And so it's just the best toothpaste you're going to find, period.
[44:38.760 --> 44:43.000]  It has the nano silver and we still have supplies of it, though it'll sell out at current rates
[44:43.000 --> 44:44.000]  in about two weeks.
[44:44.000 --> 44:49.600]  But despite that, I'm keeping it at sale at 50% off so everybody can protect themselves
[44:49.600 --> 44:51.040]  with this high quality product.
[44:51.040 --> 44:59.320]  You've never used it before, get yours today, infowarstore.com, infowarstore.com.
[44:59.320 --> 45:00.320]  Don't be a victim.
[45:00.320 --> 45:04.120]  If you're worried about the coronavirus, exercise, but not too hard because that can
[45:04.120 --> 45:05.120]  lower your immune system.
[45:05.120 --> 45:08.640]  Drink extra purified clean water so that no toxins weigh you down when you have plenty
[45:08.640 --> 45:09.640]  of hydration.
[45:09.640 --> 45:11.920]  Prayer and meditation has been proven to make you healthier.
[45:11.920 --> 45:15.360]  Get plenty of vitamin C, get plenty of vitamin D3, which is fish oil.
[45:15.360 --> 45:17.200]  Take your colloidal silver, all of it.
[45:17.200 --> 45:20.600]  That's what allows you to be healthier and get plenty of sleep.
[45:20.600 --> 45:25.400]  We have sold out of the 16 ounce immune gargle that has the nano silver that's patented and
[45:25.400 --> 45:28.840]  documented and even admitted in documents we've shown to go after this whole Corona
[45:28.840 --> 45:29.840]  SARS family.
[45:29.840 --> 45:30.840]  A virus.
[45:30.840 --> 45:32.760]  We're almost sold out of the one ounce spray bottles.
[45:32.760 --> 45:36.040]  That'll be sold out a couple days and we're in about a week and a half or so of the super
[45:36.040 --> 45:37.680]  silver three ounce bottles.
[45:37.680 --> 45:38.880]  Great to have, period.
[45:38.880 --> 45:39.880]  Really good for your gums.
[45:39.880 --> 45:40.880]  Really great for your teeth.
[45:40.880 --> 45:43.080]  We also have the super silver in our whitening toothpaste.
[45:43.080 --> 45:46.520]  Again, we're the only folks allowed to private label or make our own products with this top
[45:46.520 --> 45:49.840]  nano tech company based here in the U.S. that's in only some of the security documents and
[45:49.840 --> 45:50.840]  everything.
[45:50.840 --> 45:51.840]  Because we get the best stuff.
[45:51.840 --> 45:52.840]  There's a lot of patriots.
[45:52.840 --> 45:56.840]  There's not just bad guys coming after us, there's a flipside of all the good guys and
[45:56.840 --> 45:57.840]  good gals.
[45:57.840 --> 45:58.840]  It's very exciting.
[45:58.840 --> 46:03.720]  Keith Bansomer powers the great line of high quality storeable food we have available
[46:03.720 --> 46:06.000]  at readyhour at m4store.com.
[46:06.000 --> 46:10.160]  And yes, we're selling storeable food here, but concerns me is we're a month into this
[46:10.160 --> 46:11.480]  and food sales aren't going down.
[46:11.480 --> 46:12.480]  They're going up.
[46:12.480 --> 46:14.120]  You've never seen anything like this.
[46:14.120 --> 46:18.760]  Never, never like this and sustained, you know, we started, you know, 27 days ago and
[46:18.760 --> 46:21.440]  it kind of went hyper and it doesn't fall off.
[46:21.440 --> 46:25.120]  And then even recent days, you know, it's further increasing.
[46:25.120 --> 46:29.840]  The semis are rolling, the chips are in, we're producing as much as quickly as possible.
[46:29.840 --> 46:33.080]  Orders that are getting in today, they're going to ship, they're going to ship in 10
[46:33.080 --> 46:34.080]  to 14 days.
[46:34.080 --> 46:35.580]  We're helping people prepare.
[46:35.580 --> 46:37.080]  It's just something you cover.
[46:37.080 --> 46:38.080]  Absolutely.
[46:38.080 --> 46:39.080]  You like to eat daily.
[46:39.080 --> 46:40.320]  And so we're just backing that up.
[46:40.320 --> 46:41.880]  It's the best insurance out there.
[46:41.880 --> 46:46.400]  You can get food today that you can eat 10 years from now at today's prices.
[46:46.400 --> 46:49.960]  It's normal to sit on top storeable food and guns.
[46:49.960 --> 46:51.120]  All our forebears did it.
[46:51.120 --> 46:52.120]  We've got food.
[46:52.120 --> 46:53.120]  We've got guns.
[46:53.120 --> 46:54.120]  We've got Jesus.
[46:54.120 --> 46:55.120]  We know how to use it.
[46:55.120 --> 46:56.120]  We've got a phrase around here, Alex.
[46:56.120 --> 46:57.120]  It's real simple.
[46:57.120 --> 47:24.680]  We are back live on this Wednesday global transmission.
[47:24.680 --> 47:26.680]  A CPAC has begun.
[47:26.680 --> 47:31.480]  We're going to be at the Omni Hotel tonight in DC, the big one.
[47:31.480 --> 47:34.160]  That's where I'm sitting right now.
[47:34.160 --> 47:41.280]  I've sponsored National File with a big, giant event, 1,000 person ballroom in this really
[47:41.280 --> 47:42.280]  nice hotel.
[47:42.280 --> 47:43.280]  It's free.
[47:43.280 --> 47:46.080]  Brought to you by the listeners of M4 Wars.
[47:46.080 --> 47:53.040]  M4 Wars is the sponsor of this event, 1,000 person ballroom, free food and drinks.
[47:53.040 --> 47:56.440]  Not a big lead up to this.
[47:56.440 --> 48:00.720]  We've already had over 500 people RSVP.
[48:00.720 --> 48:03.560]  It's open to the establishment media.
[48:03.560 --> 48:05.240]  It's open to real media.
[48:05.240 --> 48:09.480]  It's open to we, the people, and I'm going to be keynote speaker.
[48:09.480 --> 48:11.760]  I tried to get Roger Stone to come.
[48:11.760 --> 48:16.840]  He was thinking about it, but he literally just says, please don't talk about my case
[48:16.840 --> 48:19.200]  because they blame me for what you're saying.
[48:19.200 --> 48:20.200]  That's the only communication.
[48:20.200 --> 48:21.720]  He says, hey, do you like my suit?
[48:21.720 --> 48:23.120]  You know, I'm a mixed jokes.
[48:23.120 --> 48:25.680]  He will not talk to me about any of it for months.
[48:25.680 --> 48:33.440]  And then Bergman Jackson is on the stand saying, Stone tells Jones what to do.
[48:33.440 --> 48:35.480]  And so I'm going to punish Stone for Jones.
[48:35.480 --> 48:39.840]  And I told Roger, I said, listen, buddy, the globalist can put a gun to my head.
[48:39.840 --> 48:41.240]  I'm not shutting up about stuff.
[48:41.240 --> 48:47.040]  I understand your position, but this is my country too and my judiciary.
[48:47.040 --> 48:48.840]  And this woman is a monster.
[48:48.840 --> 48:51.400]  And this woman has rigged the jury.
[48:51.400 --> 48:54.000]  And I understand she's holding you hostage.
[48:54.000 --> 48:57.680]  But I can't negotiate with terrorists.
[48:57.680 --> 49:02.120]  And Bergman is a terrorist, in my view, a total tire.
[49:02.120 --> 49:04.680]  And the things the swamps done, they're too corrupt to fail.
[49:04.680 --> 49:08.360]  They're too big to fail, they believe, that they committed such crimes that if one goes
[49:08.360 --> 49:09.360]  down, they all go down.
[49:09.360 --> 49:15.680]  So three musketeers, one for all and all for one, that's how they operate, but in a corruption.
[49:15.680 --> 49:18.240]  And so I'm going to explain it again.
[49:18.240 --> 49:19.480]  Everyone was in the trial.
[49:19.480 --> 49:24.840]  There were dozens, hundreds of members of the press in the overflow area as well, hundreds
[49:24.840 --> 49:28.280]  and hundreds, during jury selection three months ago.
[49:28.280 --> 49:32.720]  And we had reporters there, and I had them on air, scared to say the names.
[49:32.720 --> 49:36.160]  But then I got them to give us the names off record, and I put the names up.
[49:36.160 --> 49:38.000]  I told them, I said, I'm going to put the name out.
[49:38.000 --> 49:41.800]  And the woman headed up a federal department for Obama.
[49:41.800 --> 49:45.120]  The judge is appointed by Obama, and her husband works on the Mueller report.
[49:45.120 --> 49:46.120]  It gets it.
[49:46.120 --> 49:47.600]  That's ridiculous.
[49:47.600 --> 49:51.600]  And now we learn about the new foreman is a DNC operator with Donna Brazil, who was
[49:51.600 --> 49:53.440]  rigging all the debates for Hillary.
[49:53.440 --> 49:57.480]  Now a Fox News pundit, give me a break, but here's the big takeaway, I want Mike Adams
[49:57.480 --> 49:59.680]  to take on this.
[49:59.680 --> 50:03.520]  Now she's trying to sequester and say for the safety of the jurors, because President
[50:03.520 --> 50:11.920]  Trump, these are quotes in the news, because President Trump, Tucker Carlson and Alex Jones
[50:11.920 --> 50:15.240]  are threatening the jurors, she won't release their name.
[50:15.240 --> 50:20.760]  It's not threatening a juror after they've already ruled, after they've already voted
[50:20.760 --> 50:22.840]  with their verdict.
[50:22.840 --> 50:28.840]  Months later, to say their Democrat operatives, no wonder you kept them secret.
[50:28.840 --> 50:33.960]  So they changed the subject from her cover-up and her criminal activity to this, it is Stalinist.
[50:33.960 --> 50:38.040]  I got to tell you though, they have just done so many evil things here, Mike.
[50:38.040 --> 50:42.240]  They think they're too big to fail, but they've just gone too far, and all over DC, I'm mobbed
[50:42.240 --> 50:43.240]  by people.
[50:43.240 --> 50:47.360]  I mean, black folks going, we love Roger Stone, we love you while I'm driving the tank around
[50:47.360 --> 50:48.360]  or on the street.
[50:48.360 --> 50:53.760]  They really know about injustice, I guess, and just like Roger Stone, because I'm telling
[50:53.760 --> 50:57.800]  like every black person we drive by, especially black males, like Alex Jones, Roger Stone,
[50:57.800 --> 50:58.800]  yeah, we love you.
[50:58.800 --> 51:02.600]  It's like, wow, here in DC, what do you think's really going to happen here, Mike Adams?
[51:02.600 --> 51:08.400]  Well, Amy Berman Jackson, her actions are a parade of tyranny, the exact type of tyranny
[51:08.400 --> 51:13.920]  that our founding fathers needed us to get away from, and that's why we fought for our
[51:13.920 --> 51:14.920]  independence.
[51:14.920 --> 51:20.080]  She needs to be criminally investigated by the DOJ, not just removed from her bench,
[51:20.080 --> 51:26.040]  but criminally investigated, in my opinion, because what she is doing, abusing, exploiting
[51:26.040 --> 51:32.480]  her power to silence people who are merely trying to discuss the bias of the jury in
[51:32.480 --> 51:36.280]  a twisted, rigged case against Roger Stone.
[51:36.280 --> 51:40.560]  She needs to be investigated, and if anybody needs to go to jail for seven or nine years,
[51:40.560 --> 51:43.400]  it's people like her, not Roger Stone.
[51:43.400 --> 51:44.400]  That's my take, Alex.
[51:44.400 --> 51:46.400]  I totally agree with you.
[51:46.400 --> 51:50.560]  I want to play a few clips here that I know we're going to get into.
[51:50.560 --> 51:52.320]  Corona is the attack on nation states.
[51:52.320 --> 51:55.000]  It is the attack on Trump, and it is man-made.
[51:55.000 --> 51:57.720]  It was transferred by Obama to the Chicobs five years ago.
[51:57.720 --> 51:59.760]  That's Science Magazine.
[51:59.760 --> 52:02.640]  Five years ago, it's unbelievably hiding a plain view.
[52:02.640 --> 52:09.800]  I know that Dr. Boyle is going to have the latest breaking super intel that's world-changing,
[52:09.800 --> 52:14.080]  really, cutting edge next hour with you, but I want to just to play this.
[52:14.080 --> 52:19.280]  This is an apolitop who, I told you, friends of Trump have been threatened.
[52:19.280 --> 52:21.320]  They've been attacked, and not everybody can handle it.
[52:21.320 --> 52:25.760]  I'm just going to, I know the inside baseball, I'm going to stop there, but now that the
[52:25.760 --> 52:30.800]  Democrats have been defeated in their impeachment, now that that coup failed, Trump is cementing
[52:30.800 --> 52:33.040]  his power as the president right now.
[52:33.040 --> 52:36.760]  He's still not invincible far from it, but he's getting stronger every day.
[52:36.760 --> 52:37.760]  So are we.
[52:37.760 --> 52:38.760]  They're really scared.
[52:38.760 --> 52:39.760]  We're all coming together.
[52:39.760 --> 52:40.760]  Folks, we're winning.
[52:40.760 --> 52:46.920]  After having his job threatened and blackmail and all the rest of it, the Polatono turned
[52:46.920 --> 52:47.920]  on Trump.
[52:47.920 --> 52:51.440]  Now, I didn't attack him for that because I've been friends with him.
[52:51.440 --> 52:52.440]  I just left it at that.
[52:52.440 --> 52:55.320]  I'll just stop there, but the truth is the truth.
[52:55.320 --> 53:01.000]  Now he knows that Trump's winning, and so he didn't attack Trump with enjoyment.
[53:01.000 --> 53:03.120]  He had a gun to his head, basically.
[53:03.120 --> 53:04.480]  Now he comes out and tells the truth.
[53:04.480 --> 53:06.680]  The old Apolitono comes back.
[53:06.680 --> 53:10.080]  And remember, even some of the disciples, I'm not going to compare Trump to Jesus, but
[53:10.080 --> 53:17.760]  remember, there was, which one of the disciples was it when the Pharisees had already grabbed
[53:17.760 --> 53:19.000]  Jesus and they're like, are you with him?
[53:19.000 --> 53:20.000]  Are you with him?
[53:20.000 --> 53:21.000]  He said, I'm not with him.
[53:21.000 --> 53:22.000]  I'm not with him.
[53:22.000 --> 53:23.400]  That guy, you know, went on to be a great guy.
[53:23.400 --> 53:25.640]  People get scared, is my point.
[53:25.640 --> 53:27.840]  And they, I mean, I've never done this.
[53:27.840 --> 53:28.840]  I'm not trying to brag.
[53:28.840 --> 53:29.840]  I'm just telling you.
[53:29.840 --> 53:30.840]  I'm the opposite.
[53:30.840 --> 53:31.840]  I get threatened.
[53:31.840 --> 53:33.600]  But not everybody's a Tasmanian devil.
[53:33.600 --> 53:40.040]  And so the fact that Napolitano has now come back to the Trumpian side is another bellwether
[53:40.040 --> 53:41.920]  of our giant victory.
[53:41.920 --> 53:44.040]  So here's what Napolitano had to say.
[53:44.040 --> 53:47.880]  No one should be happy about secrecy, whether you like Stone or dislike him, whether you
[53:47.880 --> 53:50.120]  like the president or dislike him.
[53:50.120 --> 53:56.520]  This is a hearing to determine whether or not there was jury impropriety in the trial.
[53:56.520 --> 54:03.400]  Whether a juror failed to disclose her, disclose her preconceived prejudice against President
[54:03.400 --> 54:06.360]  Trump and against Roger Stone.
[54:06.360 --> 54:11.080]  Why it is secret, we're not being given a reason, but the secrecy is compounded.
[54:11.080 --> 54:14.440]  It's one thing to have a secret hearing and then let the participants go out and speak
[54:14.440 --> 54:15.440]  to the press.
[54:15.440 --> 54:20.280]  It's another thing to have a secret hearing and to bar the participants from speaking
[54:20.280 --> 54:21.440]  to the press.
[54:21.440 --> 54:22.980]  That's what this judge has done.
[54:22.980 --> 54:25.800]  This is absolutely Stalinistic.
[54:25.800 --> 54:31.520]  Now when this argument that I had been making in summary fashion was made by Stone's lawyers
[54:31.520 --> 54:36.840]  in writing two days ago, she said, OK, I will hear you at 1.30 and you can tell me why it
[54:36.840 --> 54:37.840]  should not be secret.
[54:37.840 --> 54:43.040]  And then at two o'clock, I'll lock the courtroom door and make it secret unless you change
[54:43.040 --> 54:44.040]  my mind.
[54:44.040 --> 54:45.640]  That's what we're confronting.
[54:45.640 --> 54:46.840]  That's what he says.
[54:46.840 --> 54:49.280]  She has gagged Stone.
[54:49.280 --> 54:53.720]  It is one thing to gag the defendant during a trial because you don't want him going out
[54:53.720 --> 54:57.520]  talking to the press and it's a way to communicate with the jury.
[54:57.520 --> 54:58.600]  There is no jury.
[54:58.600 --> 54:59.640]  There is no trial.
[54:59.640 --> 55:00.760]  He's been convicted.
[55:00.760 --> 55:02.840]  He's been sent.
[55:02.840 --> 55:07.280]  The gag serves no legitimate governmental purpose.
[55:07.280 --> 55:11.320]  And yet she's enforcing it on him and on his lawyers question.
[55:11.320 --> 55:18.080]  Why is the Bill Barr Department of Justice not opposing this secrecy and not opposing
[55:18.080 --> 55:19.480]  this gag role?
[55:19.480 --> 55:26.040]  Now, notice the old Napolitano was riveting and happy and smart and being himself on having
[55:26.040 --> 55:27.720]  to lie, on having to twist.
[55:27.720 --> 55:30.720]  But then the one that was attacking Trump would like to end.
[55:30.720 --> 55:35.760]  Then Trump might have done something bad here because he had a gun to his head.
[55:35.760 --> 55:38.040]  So I just point out that that's the worm turning.
[55:38.040 --> 55:40.320]  That's the whole system realizing they're losing.
[55:40.320 --> 55:42.240]  But they're going to do even more desperate things now.
[55:42.240 --> 55:44.120]  They're going to double down even bigger crimes.
[55:44.120 --> 55:48.840]  But what Jackson has been caught doing and how she's trying to cover up the rest of the
[55:48.840 --> 55:53.480]  jury pool, that's where everything is at, is the other jurors.
[55:53.480 --> 55:54.880]  Wait until we find out who else they are.
[55:54.880 --> 55:56.880]  Well, I've already been told about folks that were there.
[55:56.880 --> 55:57.880]  It's bad.
[55:57.880 --> 56:02.280]  They're basically almost all of them were Democratic Party operatives.
[56:02.280 --> 56:06.880]  One old lady said, I'm not going along with this today before the trial ended and she
[56:06.880 --> 56:09.920]  fell down in her head and a special juror was put in her place.
[56:09.920 --> 56:13.280]  She's globalist gangster activity, my God.
[56:13.280 --> 56:18.080]  It is gang style warfare at the highest levels in the United States of America.
[56:18.080 --> 56:21.960]  But as we, the independent media continue to expose the names and the backgrounds and
[56:21.960 --> 56:25.440]  the biases of these jurors, the truth is going to come out.
[56:25.440 --> 56:29.560]  The investigations must be commenced against these individuals.
[56:29.560 --> 56:34.040]  If we are to have any remaining public faith in our system of justice, in the Department
[56:34.040 --> 56:41.600]  of Justice, even in the Trump oversight or presidency itself, we have to have these potential
[56:41.600 --> 56:43.080]  criminals investigated.
[56:43.080 --> 56:44.080]  Otherwise.
[56:44.080 --> 56:45.080]  Yes.
[56:45.080 --> 56:46.080]  Mike, that's the key.
[56:46.080 --> 56:48.720]  The part I forgot, I'm glad you brought that up as you always do.
[56:48.720 --> 56:54.200]  This is the exact type of abuses the Declaration of Independence talks about heavily in judiciary
[56:54.200 --> 56:56.600]  systems that become kangaroo show trials.
[56:56.600 --> 57:00.960]  But then we have to understand they were beta testing this.
[57:00.960 --> 57:06.480]  They admit for judicial tyranny across the country, I've been under the very same systems.
[57:06.480 --> 57:09.960]  And so they pick these select judges, they're Democrat operatives that you're put into their
[57:09.960 --> 57:14.760]  courtrooms and they literally lynch you and rig things.
[57:14.760 --> 57:18.160]  That's why we've been, you know, fighting as we've been fighting, because we understand
[57:18.160 --> 57:22.200]  that they're trying to bring us into these kangaroo situations and they're so pissed.
[57:22.200 --> 57:25.280]  Every day we stay on air is another victory against them.
[57:25.280 --> 57:28.120]  We're going to come right back with five more minutes with yours truly and Mike Adams will
[57:28.120 --> 57:33.320]  then continue on and we have Dr. Francis will coming up with huge breaking Intel in full
[57:33.320 --> 57:48.320]  wars.com tomorrow's news today.
[57:48.320 --> 57:54.000]  I don't sell firearms, but I promote them constantly.
[57:54.000 --> 57:57.480]  Now could somebody listen to me and go out and buy a gun and use it wrong?
[57:57.480 --> 57:58.480]  Yeah.
[57:58.480 --> 57:59.640]  Just like I'm telling people, Hey, I'm a man.

[1:00:09.280 --> 1:00:15.880]  Ladies and gentlemen we are live broadcasting worldwide from Washington D.C. and CPAC again
[1:00:15.880 --> 1:00:18.320]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[1:00:18.320 --> 1:00:22.960]  Mike Adams is about to be taking over on the other side of this break with Dr. Francis
[1:00:22.960 --> 1:00:29.800]  Boyle the author of the U.S. biological weapons treaty that then became world law.
[1:00:29.800 --> 1:00:35.160]  He broke that it was man made confirming the Indian universities and institutes and others
[1:00:35.160 --> 1:00:40.120]  and our research and Mike Adams research and he also broke the fact that it was transferred
[1:00:40.120 --> 1:00:47.160]  by Obama five years ago from North Carolina University to the chai comms to the chai comms
[1:00:47.160 --> 1:00:49.520]  released it on purpose to get out of the lab.
[1:00:49.520 --> 1:00:52.440]  Now we see it being used against the world economy against Trump.
[1:00:52.440 --> 1:00:58.440]  I believe this has been intentional and we can all have our opinion on that but the bombshell
[1:00:58.440 --> 1:01:04.200]  is that it is man made it does have a high kill rate and areas of the world are now under
[1:01:04.200 --> 1:01:09.600]  martial law and it is expanding and you're getting more cases all over the world right
[1:01:09.600 --> 1:01:15.040]  now and more deaths and U.S. military getting it so something big is going on any way you
[1:01:15.040 --> 1:01:16.040]  slice it separately.
[1:01:16.040 --> 1:01:19.880]  We told you over a month ago that almost all the other major storeable food companies
[1:01:19.880 --> 1:01:24.800]  have sold out because of institutional buyers and governmental buyers and that our big sponsor
[1:01:24.800 --> 1:01:28.880]  the biggest in the world my patriot who again takes the orders and for store.com you know
[1:01:28.880 --> 1:01:34.360]  the front of line that they were seven to ten days the ten to fourteen days and now
[1:01:34.360 --> 1:01:39.680]  they're up to three weeks no no four weeks now get your order in it's locked in at four
[1:01:39.680 --> 1:01:47.080]  weeks but it may be five weeks by next week because the food orders are going up exponentially.
[1:01:47.080 --> 1:01:50.400]  We didn't want to have a sponsor that just sells to government every time there's a crisis
[1:01:50.400 --> 1:01:52.480]  so that you get your food from the government.
[1:01:52.480 --> 1:01:56.240]  We wanted to have it directly to the people my patriots been around twelve years we've
[1:01:56.240 --> 1:02:00.240]  been with them eleven they've been partners for us partners with us about five or six
[1:02:00.240 --> 1:02:04.000]  years where they actually run our shopping cart you know the area that takes the orders
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:11.320]  so you get fastest delivery and it's just amazing to know that the general public as
[1:02:11.320 --> 1:02:16.680]  Mike Adams said a few days ago is now going on and buying storeable food the general public
[1:02:16.680 --> 1:02:21.120]  that had never done it the customers we have it in four store.com most of them are customers
[1:02:21.120 --> 1:02:25.080]  that never bought from us before and that's the general public realizing that they need
[1:02:25.080 --> 1:02:28.880]  storeable foods that's the general public realizing that there's a real crisis going
[1:02:28.880 --> 1:02:33.000]  on and now the federal government saying get storeable food get prepared to shelter in
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:37.600]  place for at least a month what do they know that we don't know hopefully they're just
[1:02:37.600 --> 1:02:42.680]  overreacting hopefully it's just hype but it doesn't matter this is insurance you can
[1:02:42.680 --> 1:02:47.520]  eat and it funds the info war and you see us here driving around the federal building

[1:04:45.680 --> 1:04:49.840]  industry around the world that builds biological weapons against humanity that's coming up

[1:04:57.280 --> 1:05:04.960]  There can no longer be any doubt this coronavirus is serious on multiple levels it's very communicable
[1:05:04.960 --> 1:05:10.840]  it spreads very very fast it is killing a lot of people and the Chinese communist government

[1:06:15.440 --> 1:06:20.640]  joined in this segment next couple of segments in fact by Professor Francis Boyle who has
[1:06:20.640 --> 1:06:26.640]  been one of the most courageous and accurate outspoken voices you could call him a whistleblower
[1:06:26.640 --> 1:06:33.560]  on this issue of the bioengineering origins of the current COVID-19 coronavirus that is
[1:06:33.560 --> 1:06:40.160]  circulating and spreading worldwide a professor Boyle joins us by Skype with some new questions
[1:06:40.160 --> 1:06:44.120]  I've got a lot of new questions for you today but welcome to the show Professor Boyle it's
[1:06:44.120 --> 1:06:46.200]  great to have you on.
[1:06:46.200 --> 1:06:52.400]  Well thank you for having me on Mike and my best you're viewing audience and keep up
[1:06:52.400 --> 1:06:59.840]  the good work with your newsletter I can't guarantee I can answer all your questions
[1:06:59.840 --> 1:07:08.760]  Mike because this is an evolving situation and I try to evaluate the evidence as it comes
[1:07:08.760 --> 1:07:15.680]  in so you're free to answer your questions but if I don't have the answers please accept
[1:07:15.680 --> 1:07:16.680]  my apologies.
[1:07:16.680 --> 1:07:21.560]  Well this is what we appreciate about you you often talk about you're working with the
[1:07:21.560 --> 1:07:27.040]  best information available at the moment you would you adjust your answers as new information
[1:07:27.040 --> 1:07:32.080]  comes in it's a very scientific approach to being cautious but as accurate as you can
[1:07:32.080 --> 1:07:36.960]  given the current data set so let's begin with a question going back to some of your
[1:07:36.960 --> 1:07:44.320]  previous interviews with Owen Schreuer and Alex Jones is it accurate to state that because
[1:07:44.320 --> 1:07:50.920]  the the imprint of the origins of the virus is really part of the RNA code of the virus
[1:07:50.920 --> 1:07:55.440]  isn't it true or let's have your take on it that basically any virologist who has the
[1:07:55.440 --> 1:08:02.920]  proper library of patterns of RNA could independently confirm that yes this had to have been engineered
[1:08:02.920 --> 1:08:06.560]  because here's the evidence of it is that an accurate statement.
[1:08:06.560 --> 1:08:16.960]  Yes it's a matter of fact when I was on with Alex I cited that study by the French and
[1:08:16.960 --> 1:08:28.960]  Canadian virologist saying yes indeed it was gain or function work and two Chinese that
[1:08:28.960 --> 1:08:37.040]  that I cited last week two Chinese scientists came out and said the same thing and we would
[1:08:37.040 --> 1:08:42.840]  call that an admission against interest we lawyers we actually have Chinese scientists
[1:08:42.840 --> 1:08:50.040]  coming out and saying yes it came out of that wool hand BSL4 lab now I've read recently
[1:08:50.040 --> 1:08:59.160]  they were forced to withdraw that study but you can see it there so sure and I think if
[1:08:59.160 --> 1:09:06.880]  I can figure it out I don't have a PhD from MIT but if I can figure it out I think most
[1:09:06.880 --> 1:09:13.520]  people can figure it out sure certainly virologists microbiologists can yes so it's interesting
[1:09:13.520 --> 1:09:19.040]  that you just mentioned the political pressure in China for those scientists to withdraw their
[1:09:19.040 --> 1:09:23.240]  paper we've seen that before not the first time with this here's a question to you and
[1:09:23.240 --> 1:09:26.440]  if you're not comfortable answering this that's that's perfectly okay you can you can pass
[1:09:26.440 --> 1:09:31.560]  on them but are you being pressured to stop doing these interviews for example to stop
[1:09:31.560 --> 1:09:35.760]  talking about this I know you've been blacklisted from the media for many many years you mentioned
[1:09:35.760 --> 1:09:41.040]  that before are you receiving new pressure now for talking about the bioengineering origins
[1:09:41.040 --> 1:09:51.200]  of this virus well let me put it this way as I said the last time I was interviewed
[1:09:51.200 --> 1:10:00.960]  I did blow the whistle on a marathon coming out of a U.S. biological warfare weapons program
[1:10:00.960 --> 1:10:09.320]  the first week in the weekend of November 2001 I said that the Fox News I said that
[1:10:09.320 --> 1:10:18.320]  to a Washington DC radio station and then I said it to the BBC so the whole world heard
[1:10:18.320 --> 1:10:24.760]  me then and then I was cut off the hammer came down and no other mainstream news media
[1:10:24.760 --> 1:10:31.080]  source certainly here in the United States Europe Latin America Asia has interviewed
[1:10:31.080 --> 1:10:38.320]  me so certainly I have been blackballed and blacklisted since then despite the fact that
[1:10:38.320 --> 1:10:46.920]  I wrote the statute that deals precisely with this issue and criminalizes it and expressly
[1:10:46.920 --> 1:10:55.480]  dealing with the use of DNA genetic engineering to create biological weapons as the pressure
[1:10:55.480 --> 1:11:06.040]  so far the only pressure I've gotten was some public relations firm up in Chicago who was
[1:11:06.040 --> 1:11:15.160]  paid I guess to silence me by filing complaints with the law school demanding an explanation
[1:11:15.160 --> 1:11:24.720]  for why I was perpetrating fake news wow well but you know as far as I can figure out there's
[1:11:24.720 --> 1:11:30.920]  a big consulate Chinese consulate up there in Chicago and they probably were paying
[1:11:30.920 --> 1:11:38.720]  them to try to intimidate me into silence but so far that's the only pressure I've seen
[1:11:38.720 --> 1:11:46.200]  on on the current situation things could change but I'm still being blackballed off all the
[1:11:46.200 --> 1:11:52.160]  mainstream news news media here in the United States and if you just do a course you'll
[1:11:52.160 --> 1:11:57.480]  see my name is all over everywhere over the entire world but not and not that I want the
[1:11:57.480 --> 1:12:03.760]  publicity but I don't really need it but you're not really a frontline whistleblower until
[1:12:03.760 --> 1:12:10.120]  you've had a PR company hired to spread lies and defame you so you are in good company
[1:12:10.120 --> 1:12:13.400]  because of course I've had the same thing happen to me same things happen to Alex and
[1:12:13.400 --> 1:12:17.880]  so on so yeah there's a coordinated well-funded campaign to try to smear all the voices that
[1:12:17.880 --> 1:12:26.000]  are telling the truth about about this another smear they they they were trying to intimidate
[1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:33.720]  me into silence by filing this complaint with my employer is what they were doing I'm not
[1:12:33.720 --> 1:12:39.040]  easily intimidated what can I say well that's that's what we love about you because you
[1:12:39.040 --> 1:12:44.960]  follow the science you have the courage to state the obvious when it's not politically
[1:12:44.960 --> 1:12:49.920]  correct and I don't know your politics in general and that's not even relevant here
[1:12:49.920 --> 1:12:56.520]  I honor you for your courage on this issue next question I do want to say I am a political
[1:12:56.520 --> 1:13:03.960]  independent when I decided to do this work shortly after turning 17 years old I concluded
[1:13:03.960 --> 1:13:09.880]  the only way I could do it was remain a political independent and and so that's how I appear
[1:13:09.880 --> 1:13:19.120]  here wise president Trump or anything like that right I'm trying to look at this objectively
[1:13:19.120 --> 1:13:26.360]  and analytically from my background in training and and tell the truth as I see it of course
[1:13:26.360 --> 1:13:33.560]  I could be wrong new information could come out at any time that would force me to reevaluate
[1:13:33.560 --> 1:13:40.000]  my position and I get in here I get up early in the morning go through the computer I see
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:45.800]  your newsletter and a lot of other sources and for the last week I get my secretary to
[1:13:45.800 --> 1:13:50.560]  run them off I come in here first thing in the morning in my office and I read through
[1:13:50.560 --> 1:13:59.160]  them all and then I continue on with my ongoing evaluation because it's such a fluid situation
[1:13:59.160 --> 1:14:04.120]  Mike as you know yes well and by the way I apologize I misspelled your first name in
[1:14:04.120 --> 1:14:07.840]  the first round of the transcript that we did but I now know how to spell your name
[1:14:07.840 --> 1:14:16.160]  correctly I apologize next question is how easy is it for rogue nations to harvest this
[1:14:16.160 --> 1:14:22.640]  virus now that it is really open source it's in the public domain if I ran or North Korea
[1:14:22.640 --> 1:14:26.600]  or anyone wanted to harvest this virus and then incubate it and grow it themselves how
[1:14:26.600 --> 1:14:35.120]  easy would that be well it's out there yeah I think we have to understand that the the
[1:14:35.120 --> 1:14:46.560]  original people who grew it were the University of North Carolina I established that already
[1:14:46.560 --> 1:14:55.640]  in my last interview I went through the entire scientific article which Alex put up there
[1:14:55.640 --> 1:15:03.080]  and due to limitations of time we only had an hour I could only spend about 10 minutes
[1:15:03.080 --> 1:15:10.520]  going through this article yes evil behind this article of what they were doing and what
[1:15:10.520 --> 1:15:18.440]  they knew they were doing and that they took this dirty money from China to allow one of
[1:15:18.440 --> 1:15:27.600]  the leading death scientists from China to be involved in this extremely dangerous existentially
[1:15:27.600 --> 1:15:34.120]  dangerous research and undoubtedly I'm sorry to interrupt you hold that thought we've got
[1:15:34.120 --> 1:15:39.720]  to go to a break here we're going to come back with more details from Francis Boyle
[1:15:39.720 --> 1:15:44.640]  about the bioengineering origins of this virus and what it means for humanity and the death

[1:17:54.680 --> 1:18:03.960]  a lot of people ask me the info war secret and I'll just tell you I'm just real now the
[1:18:03.960 --> 1:18:09.520]  problem is I go back and forth though in my mind about where I stand I mean on basic stuff
[1:18:09.520 --> 1:18:15.080]  like the second amendment family and God I'm 100% but you know other issues I start asking
[1:18:15.080 --> 1:18:20.160]  myself questions so I'll just tell you I feel really guilty during the middle of this crisis
[1:18:20.160 --> 1:18:24.840]  selling high quality storeable food even though it's prepositioned I'm right we're right about
[1:18:24.840 --> 1:18:28.600]  being man made we're right about it being super deadly we're right about being prepared
[1:18:28.600 --> 1:18:34.840]  it still feels weird to be right isn't that crazy but you know what I'm getting past that
[1:18:34.840 --> 1:18:38.840]  we still have storeable food we have plenty of it the problem is the packaging of it
[1:18:38.840 --> 1:18:43.080]  and getting it out other competitors don't have it they're lying to you gear orders
[1:18:43.080 --> 1:18:47.360]  and info or store.com and you know you're gonna get high quality storeable food but
[1:18:47.360 --> 1:18:52.040]  now it's not two weeks it's four weeks folks we got the food we got a package it get your
[1:18:52.040 --> 1:18:58.240]  food today high quality and fund the info war and infowarstore.com across the western
[1:18:58.240 --> 1:19:06.520]  world from high school to college sports to even the Olympics men biological men are winning
[1:19:06.520 --> 1:19:13.040]  almost all of the sporting events this is men invading women's spaces and bullying them
[1:19:13.040 --> 1:19:18.200]  and taking their rights away all in the name of the liberalism and openness and then every
[1:19:18.200 --> 1:19:24.240]  day I have stacks of news articles just like today UK team find under house arrest for
[1:19:24.240 --> 1:19:30.760]  asking trans police officers gender and it hurt their feelings UK mother spared jail
[1:19:30.760 --> 1:19:36.040]  for misgendering trans woman ordered to pay thousand pound fine because it could have
[1:19:36.040 --> 1:19:43.320]  caused anxiety in the new royalty that's the thought police if a leftist has their feeling
[1:19:43.320 --> 1:19:48.920]  sir for any reason you get fined and you go to jail this is tyranny these people are
[1:19:48.920 --> 1:19:54.520]  bullies and it's sick and it's evil and it's part of a scientific anti-human takeover
[1:19:54.520 --> 1:19:59.560]  resist it speak out against it.
[1:19:59.560 --> 1:20:16.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's
[1:20:16.040 --> 1:20:24.920]  Mike Adams you're listening to the Alex Jones show and we're back on the Alex Jones show
[1:20:24.920 --> 1:20:29.680]  Mike Adams here interviewing professor Francis Boyle about the origins of the coronavirus
[1:20:29.680 --> 1:20:36.400]  we're almost going to ask him here about biological weapons response protocols that may be likely
[1:20:36.400 --> 1:20:42.040]  by nations that this is ever deployed in an aggressive weapon format this segment of course
[1:20:42.040 --> 1:20:47.560]  is brought to you by info or store.com get your preparedness food now while you still
[1:20:47.560 --> 1:20:53.480]  can remember if we are wrong about all this and you end up extra prepared you're prepared
[1:20:53.480 --> 1:20:59.360]  against every eventuality every crisis if we are right about this and you don't prepare
[1:20:59.360 --> 1:21:04.920]  then you're in a lot of trouble so get prepared it's a smart thing to do it's like buying
[1:21:04.920 --> 1:21:11.240]  insurance for your life and it's much better than having nothing to eat so so definitely
[1:21:11.240 --> 1:21:16.960]  info or store.com continuing with professor Francis Boyle so my my opening question here
[1:21:16.960 --> 1:21:22.520]  is as I just hinted their professor is there a protocol in place for the United States
[1:21:22.520 --> 1:21:28.600]  for example if the US is confirming that we are being let's say attacked with a biological
[1:21:28.600 --> 1:21:35.560]  weapon what what protocols might be in place to respond to that because how do you not escalate
[1:21:35.560 --> 1:21:38.880]  that or what are other countries doing in terms of their escalation policies do you
[1:21:38.880 --> 1:21:46.920]  have some background on that well Mike we attacked ourselves we have to understand that again
[1:21:46.920 --> 1:21:55.080]  excuse me yes so go ahead we're talking about escalation protocols biological weapons responses
[1:21:55.080 --> 1:22:03.480]  as far as I can tell Mike we attacked ourselves with that University of North Carolina gain
[1:22:03.480 --> 1:22:10.680]  of function DNA genetically engineered research that basically China paid to get access to
[1:22:10.680 --> 1:22:21.280]  and took back and that's now leaked out of that BSL for facility as for protocols well
[1:22:21.280 --> 1:22:28.680]  Mike the problem is if if you look at the response by the United States government so far I'm
[1:22:28.680 --> 1:22:35.800]  not personally blaming President Trump but I am blaming all of his scientific advisors
[1:22:35.800 --> 1:22:44.600]  you'll see mass confusion disinformation and lies and that is because all of President
[1:22:44.600 --> 1:22:52.520]  Trump top and scientific advisors have been up to their eyeballs in this Nazi biological
[1:22:52.520 --> 1:23:00.200]  warfare work for forever Tony Fauci who's out there he knows all about it and what does
[1:23:00.200 --> 1:23:05.360]  he say in today's New York Times well just continue on the way we're going we're doing
[1:23:05.360 --> 1:23:14.160]  a great job right the woman less money well she says well we got to get ready but she's
[1:23:14.160 --> 1:23:22.480]  not going to come clean with us Azar the secretary of health he worked for the pharmaceutical
[1:23:22.480 --> 1:23:29.680]  companies and he was a lobbyist for the pharmaceutical countries they plan to make a killing off
[1:23:29.680 --> 1:23:37.800]  of this and so he's in cahoots in cahoots with them CDC has been up to their eyeballs
[1:23:37.800 --> 1:23:44.120]  and biological warfare work since at least the Reagan administration yeah so how can
[1:23:44.120 --> 1:23:53.400]  any of these people coordinate a proper response to the health care crisis here that affects
[1:23:53.400 --> 1:24:02.680]  us in America today they can't and that's why even your own newsletter put out a basically
[1:24:02.680 --> 1:24:09.560]  a silencing of reporting here by the CDC I think that's correct where say well there's
[1:24:09.560 --> 1:24:14.960]  only 57 cases don't worry about it well we we see this Harvard professor estimate two
[1:24:14.960 --> 1:24:21.840]  to four hundred it's far worse I think than anything they are telling it and then Larry
[1:24:21.840 --> 1:24:28.080]  cuddlows say well we have it all under control don't worry about it this is this so how like
[1:24:28.080 --> 1:24:37.080]  how can we deal with the current situation here in America let's put aside the rest
[1:24:37.080 --> 1:24:47.280]  of the world if the people advising the president are guilty themselves yeah I absolutely possibly
[1:24:47.280 --> 1:24:51.680]  be done I've got huge concerns you just hinted at a couple of them I'm glad you pointed out
[1:24:51.680 --> 1:24:56.720]  that the very corporations the pharmaceutical industries that stand to gain billions of
[1:24:56.720 --> 1:25:01.560]  dollars maybe tens of billions of dollars in profits from the vaccine are really linked
[1:25:01.560 --> 1:25:06.320]  to the same people that built this by a weapon in the first place so the weapon gets out
[1:25:06.320 --> 1:25:10.400]  people get infected to start dying and then they get a windfall of profits by creating
[1:25:10.400 --> 1:25:17.120]  the vaccines and then they get to be positioned as the saviors of humanity because now lives
[1:25:17.120 --> 1:25:22.040]  are being saved by the mandatory vaccine which is being fast tracked with probably no clinical
[1:25:22.040 --> 1:25:26.760]  trials and there's going to Congress is going to pass a law to say that the vaccine companies
[1:25:26.760 --> 1:25:31.880]  have legal immunity from side effects and so on and so forth I get all that and that's
[1:25:31.880 --> 1:25:36.440]  kind of what you're describing is what it sounds like my these vaccines will be more
[1:25:36.440 --> 1:25:43.920]  dangerous than worthless between you and me indeed that's what happened was behind the
[1:25:43.920 --> 1:25:55.200]  Ebola pandemic there in West Africa it was a bio warfare Ebola vaccine that was being
[1:25:55.200 --> 1:26:06.200]  given out at that BSL for facility at Kenema that was being run by Fort Dietrich and US
[1:26:06.200 --> 1:26:15.120]  AID which is really a front organization for the CIA and the Broad Institute of Harvard
[1:26:15.120 --> 1:26:24.240]  and MIT and they gave these black West Africans this Ebola vaccine alleged vaccine that was
[1:26:24.240 --> 1:26:30.080]  getting them live Ebola in there and there was also I can't remember this Glaxo Smith
[1:26:30.080 --> 1:26:35.440]  Klein that was involved in that too and they eventually admitted yeah the the vaccine was
[1:26:35.440 --> 1:26:39.920]  more dangerous than worthless but they're in there so sure all the drug companies that
[1:26:39.920 --> 1:26:48.560]  Oz are represented and I suspect still is in cahoots with they're out there champ chomping
[1:26:48.560 --> 1:26:54.360]  at the bit and getting ready if you read yesterday's Wall Street Journal they just had a big article
[1:26:54.360 --> 1:27:02.920]  on this and you know everyone's trying to rush into print it into proof these these bogus
[1:27:02.920 --> 1:27:07.640]  vaccines that there are I suspect they're only gonna make this situation work certainly
[1:27:07.640 --> 1:27:13.040]  I wouldn't take one of them I guess well what other will do is up to them they rushed the
[1:27:13.040 --> 1:27:19.160]  diagnostic test kits the CDC did and those test kits had bad reagents and it turned out
[1:27:19.160 --> 1:27:24.160]  that those kits had false positives and false negatives so of course they're completely unreliable
[1:27:24.160 --> 1:27:28.560]  from a scientific point of view if you don't know whether your results are false positive
[1:27:28.560 --> 1:27:33.440]  or false negative it's pointless so now the CDC says they're gonna replace those but doesn't
[1:27:33.440 --> 1:27:38.480]  this also then underscore the fact that everything is being so rushed that quality control steps
[1:27:38.480 --> 1:27:43.680]  are being skipped laboratory validation is being skipped I mean I spent 18 months validating
[1:27:43.680 --> 1:27:48.160]  a quantitation method for glyphosate in my lab I know how long this takes that's not
[1:27:48.160 --> 1:27:53.240]  even with genetics that's just liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry that took me a year and
[1:27:53.240 --> 1:27:59.000]  a half you can't make a vaccine in six months unless you skip all the quality control that's
[1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:04.880]  what I know for sure would you agree with that of course this this becomes nothing more than
[1:28:04.880 --> 1:28:11.920]  a violation of the Nuremberg code on medical experimentation you're exactly right as for
[1:28:11.920 --> 1:28:20.000]  the CDC they promised there would be a replacement test put out no replacement tests have been
[1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:27.920]  put out at all right to none and by the way by comparison in South Korea I believe they've
[1:28:27.920 --> 1:28:38.600]  already tested 30,000 people so why why those tests here on the spot to use for the benefit
[1:28:38.600 --> 1:28:43.520]  of the American people certainly it's unreal we gotta go to break I apologize professor
[1:28:43.520 --> 1:28:47.680]  boy we gotta go to break real quick we'll be back with more stay with us one more segment
[1:28:47.680 --> 1:28:53.280]  please this is just mind-blowing information Alex Jones show Mike Adams here stay with
[1:28:53.280 --> 1:28:57.920]  us one more break one more segment we'll be back hi I'm Dan Pilla I started fighting

[1:33:18.280 --> 1:33:32.680]  This has been just an extraordinary conversation already with Professor Francis Boyle who is
[1:33:32.680 --> 1:33:39.200]  the author of really that I think one of the most important founding documents on biological
[1:33:39.200 --> 1:33:45.680]  weapons and treaties and restrictions and so on and he is outspoken in terms of well
[1:33:45.680 --> 1:33:51.800]  just having courage to state what's true and with accuracy as well and without any political
[1:33:51.800 --> 1:33:56.040]  overtones so Professor Boyle thank you for continuing with us it's a real pleasure to
[1:33:56.040 --> 1:34:01.240]  speak with you my question for this segment is you understand this perhaps more than most
[1:34:01.240 --> 1:34:08.040]  what would be the rational deployment plan of any nation that was developing these weapons
[1:34:08.040 --> 1:34:12.440]  what are they thinking could possibly be a scenario where they could even aggressively
[1:34:12.440 --> 1:34:16.880]  use them because with nuclear weapons you have half lives of the radioisotopes nuclear
[1:34:16.880 --> 1:34:22.320]  weapons go away biological weapons self-replicate so you don't have half lives you have doubling
[1:34:22.320 --> 1:34:29.560]  time you have are not values how do you ever close that Pandora's box what are they thinking
[1:34:29.560 --> 1:34:38.560]  like you're right I mean this is a Nazi mentality at work that we see at the University of
[1:34:38.560 --> 1:34:48.000]  North Carolina and I sent you an article which which you mentioned there on your newsletter
[1:34:48.000 --> 1:34:56.920]  that U.S. biological warfare programs have 13,000 death scientists at work and that was
[1:34:56.920 --> 1:35:04.680]  as of 2015 the last time I crunched the numbers so you're right now they justify this by saying
[1:35:04.680 --> 1:35:14.800]  well once we have developed the biological warfare offensive agent then we will develop
[1:35:14.800 --> 1:35:22.760]  a vaccine so that we can protect ourselves against this Machiavellian monster this Frankensteinian
[1:35:22.760 --> 1:35:29.840]  monster that we have already developed and those are the two elements of an effective
[1:35:29.840 --> 1:35:37.680]  biological weapon itself first the the offensive agent and then second the vaccine indeed that's
[1:35:37.680 --> 1:35:45.080]  what UNC tried to justify if you read through it oh well there might be this terrible biological
[1:35:45.080 --> 1:35:52.000]  warfare agent out there that we need to protect ourselves from so let's develop this terrible
[1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:58.080]  biological warfare agent in the first place and then we can make a vaccine to protect
[1:35:58.080 --> 1:36:03.360]  ourselves from it it's almost like a like a mafia shakedown of the taxpayers where where
[1:36:03.360 --> 1:36:08.920]  the mafia comes to your retail store in Chicago and says I sure would be a bad thing if this
[1:36:08.920 --> 1:36:13.200]  thing caught fire you better pay us so we can protect you from the fire I mean that's
[1:36:13.200 --> 1:36:17.760]  what the whole death science industry is doing on a on a global scale they're putting us
[1:36:17.760 --> 1:36:22.760]  all at risk so they can make money developing weapons that are designed to exterminate human
[1:36:22.760 --> 1:36:31.560]  beings how insane is this well you're right about that Mike it's all about the money these
[1:36:31.560 --> 1:36:40.080]  so-called death scientists are on a gravy train if you look at the article I sent you
[1:36:40.080 --> 1:36:51.080]  again the last time I crunched the numbers from 9 11 2001 until 2015 October 2015 the
[1:36:51.080 --> 1:36:59.920]  United States government has spent over $100 billion my goodness not see biological warfare
[1:36:59.920 --> 1:37:08.360]  weapons work so of course it's a gravy train for all these 13,000 of death scientists and
[1:37:08.360 --> 1:37:14.080]  I would add in it's usually about five billion a year so as of today it's probably in the
[1:37:14.080 --> 1:37:20.600]  area of 120 billion and now the Democrats are saying well let's throw another $8 billion
[1:37:20.600 --> 1:37:28.960]  to these Nazis that that's not going to sell anything so that you perfectly correct but
[1:37:28.960 --> 1:37:37.920]  it it's all about the money when you say Nazis it's not a flippant comment you're talking
[1:37:37.920 --> 1:37:45.800]  about the historical origins of the intellectual the lineage of this research goes back to
[1:37:45.800 --> 1:37:53.280]  Nazi Germany correct I mean you're not just well not only that my it goes back to the
[1:37:53.280 --> 1:38:03.120]  Japanese Imperial Army's occupation of China before and during the Second World War and
[1:38:03.120 --> 1:38:09.560]  they were allies with Hitler and Mussolini the pact of steel and they had a massive
[1:38:09.560 --> 1:38:18.120]  biological warfare weapons program against the Chinese when the war ended the United
[1:38:18.120 --> 1:38:25.400]  States government made a deal with them namely if you turn over all your biological warfare
[1:38:25.400 --> 1:38:35.560]  work agents research etc and you not see death scientists cooperate with us we will not prosecute
[1:38:35.560 --> 1:38:42.920]  you so yes I'm not exaggerating these are the allies of Hitler and Mussolini who were
[1:38:42.920 --> 1:38:49.360]  doing this to the Chinese people and that's where a good deal although not all of our
[1:38:49.360 --> 1:38:57.440]  biological warfare weapons program came from that Merck was really there at the beginning
[1:38:57.440 --> 1:39:03.480]  but a good chunk of it came from these Nazi bio warfare death scientists there in China
[1:39:03.480 --> 1:39:11.080]  sure so the origins of this are consistent with the anti-human philosophical slant of
[1:39:11.080 --> 1:39:17.760]  eugenicists who committed atrocities carried out the Holocaust against humanity and by
[1:39:17.760 --> 1:39:22.520]  the way I want to add something what you said which is operation paperclip the Apollo program
[1:39:22.520 --> 1:39:27.600]  was built of course by Nazi rocket scientists who were offered US citizenship after World
[1:39:27.600 --> 1:39:34.840]  War two the v2 rockets were the precursor to the Apollo rockets and we America sent people
[1:39:34.840 --> 1:39:41.400]  to the moon because of Nazi scientists that's not an exaggeration that's history so that's
[1:39:41.400 --> 1:39:47.840]  exactly correct and as a matter of fact as for the eugenics movement well that originated
[1:39:47.840 --> 1:39:53.880]  here in the United States and Hitler and the Nazis thought it was a great idea they got
[1:39:53.880 --> 1:40:01.920]  from us and eventually they proceeded to apply it as you said to the Jews to the Roma and
[1:40:01.920 --> 1:40:10.000]  to Slavic people they were deemed to be an inferior racist of people that's right and
[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:16.520]  some of the funders today for example the Rockefeller Institute Bayer eugenicists so
[1:40:16.520 --> 1:40:23.960]  you have eugenics and eugenic philosophy getting involved with Bill Gates funding a lot of
[1:40:23.960 --> 1:40:31.040]  this Gates said we need a lot fewer people in the world so yes that is correct all right
[1:40:31.040 --> 1:40:35.600]  we've only got about two minutes left I could talk to you for hours I mean this is beyond
[1:40:35.600 --> 1:40:42.440]  fascinating but where does this go if we don't stop this death science industry where do we
[1:40:42.440 --> 1:40:47.120]  end up in another 10 years if we even survive that long who knows but if they get better
[1:40:47.120 --> 1:40:55.440]  at killing humans we're having how do we survive this as a species that's my question well
[1:40:55.440 --> 1:40:59.880]  I agree with you Mike that's why I drafted my biological weapons anti-terrorism act
[1:40:59.880 --> 1:41:06.440]  of 1989 that provides life imprisonment for all these death scientists certainly we need
[1:41:06.440 --> 1:41:15.360]  immediately to shut down all BSL 3 and BSL 4 laboratories here in the United States
[1:41:15.360 --> 1:41:24.200]  and abroad that's for sure we have at least I would say 12 BSL 4s they should be shut
[1:41:24.200 --> 1:41:32.280]  down this afternoon and the same with the BSL 3s and then the people doing this type
[1:41:32.280 --> 1:41:38.320]  of death science research like the University of North Carolina they should be investigated
[1:41:38.320 --> 1:41:43.920]  and prosecuted for violating my biological weapons anti-terrorism act that provides
[1:41:43.920 --> 1:41:50.280]  life in prison right and that's why I drafted that in the first place to send a shot across
[1:41:50.280 --> 1:41:56.800]  their bio so the universities have become the bio weapons terrorism factories of America
[1:41:56.800 --> 1:42:05.160]  you're correct if you look at these contracts Harvard where I went I have three degrees
[1:42:05.160 --> 1:42:12.680]  there University of Chicago undergrad University of North Carolina here at the University of
[1:42:12.680 --> 1:42:18.800]  Illinois right they're all on the gravy train that's exactly right and they don't really
[1:42:18.800 --> 1:42:28.400]  care about the existential dangers behind this type of research it's unreal a professor
[1:42:28.400 --> 1:42:32.120]  Boyle it's an honor to speak with you I hope you'll join me again in the future it's it's

[1:47:54.640 --> 1:47:58.560]  we send out emails every day by the way for those of you signing up for email newsletters
[1:47:58.560 --> 1:48:04.880]  whether it's info wars or us or anybody don't use gmail and don't use yahoo mail and don't
[1:48:04.880 --> 1:48:09.680]  use microsoft mail because all those three providers and i'm sure the info wars team
[1:48:09.680 --> 1:48:15.680]  technical people can confirm this they tend to ban independent media emails so you should
[1:48:15.680 --> 1:48:22.080]  use something more like a proton mail dot com or a hush mail or some more of an independent email
[1:48:22.080 --> 1:48:28.240]  provider otherwise you're going to get banned like microsoft banned our emails temporarily
[1:48:28.240 --> 1:48:34.800]  a week ago and so that was hotmail and microsoft or msn and all that stuff and we couldn't deliver
[1:48:34.800 --> 1:48:40.480]  emails to all of our microsoft subscribers they just do that to mess with us they do it on purpose
[1:48:40.480 --> 1:48:46.480]  now one of the things that we cover is natural molecules natural supplements things like that
[1:48:46.480 --> 1:48:50.880]  and i i always promise to show and tell here by the way alan keys is coming up here in just a
[1:48:50.880 --> 1:48:54.880]  minute but i got to share this with you because i brought another show until this is not something
[1:48:54.880 --> 1:49:02.320]  that i sell this is something that i found that i discovered in my research this is a special spice
[1:49:02.320 --> 1:49:11.200]  you got to watch this it's it's called kubeb pepper c u b e b kubeb pepper it's also known as
[1:49:11.200 --> 1:49:18.480]  java pepper or tailed pepper i've got a bowl of it right here and this contains the molecule
[1:49:18.480 --> 1:49:25.040]  that we spoke about yesterday hinokinon the same molecule that was in the hinoki wood
[1:49:25.040 --> 1:49:31.520]  that we talked about yesterday this is the spice that's used to flavor some russian vodka it contains
[1:49:31.520 --> 1:49:40.400]  this molecule that has been tested for the three cl protease inhibition properties which may be useful
[1:49:40.400 --> 1:49:46.480]  in what we're seeing today it's probably going to be studied for a possible future drug it doesn't
[1:49:46.480 --> 1:49:52.720]  hurt to eat more spices and i'm not saying to anybody that you should never take pharmaceuticals
[1:49:52.720 --> 1:49:58.320]  or never even consider the vaccine if it's ever made safe i'm just saying look there's nothing
[1:49:58.320 --> 1:50:04.400]  else available why not spice up your life you know why not just have better food better cuisine
[1:50:04.400 --> 1:50:09.040]  i've talked about indian cuisine like lebanese food middle eastern food all these spices this
[1:50:09.040 --> 1:50:15.840]  is another spice kubeb pepper you can get it i think it's sold on amazon and spice companies and
[1:50:15.840 --> 1:50:21.360]  herb companies and places like that again it's called java pepper or tailed pepper uh this is
[1:50:21.360 --> 1:50:26.560]  something that i'm and it tastes amazing it's like an explosion of 50 different spices right in
[1:50:26.560 --> 1:50:32.480]  your mouth it's not peppery like black pepper it's more like a nutmeg cinnamon mint explosion it's
[1:50:32.480 --> 1:50:38.560]  nuts it's crazy if i ate it right now i probably couldn't speak and i couldn't introduce alan keys
[1:50:38.560 --> 1:50:43.360]  so i'm not going to eat it at the moment but uh this is the kind of thing to check out now
[1:50:43.360 --> 1:50:46.880]  every day i'm going to bring you something okay that's my promise i'm hosting for the next couple
[1:50:46.880 --> 1:50:51.520]  of days along with alan keys who's one of my favorite people i love to talk with alan keys

[1:50:57.680 --> 1:51:03.120]  but welcome to the show alan can you also tell us who's your guest coming up because i'm not familiar
[1:51:03.120 --> 1:51:09.920]  with this guest oh a guest coming up is john michael chambers uh and he's going to be uh
[1:51:09.920 --> 1:51:14.240]  we're going to be going back and forth a little bit about what the media is pleased to call
[1:51:14.800 --> 1:51:20.560]  the purge at the white house okay that i don't particularly care for well you are outstanding
[1:51:20.560 --> 1:51:25.840]  i'm going to turn the show over to you i thank you for who you are and what you do and your
[1:51:25.840 --> 1:51:30.400]  willingness to speak the truth every day here it's just an honor to know you alan so i'm
[1:51:30.400 --> 1:51:34.720]  going to turn the show over to you right now well thank you it's an honor to be in your company
[1:51:34.720 --> 1:51:42.080]  and and uh i'm glad to know uh that we're both of us now um doing a good turn for
[1:51:42.080 --> 1:51:48.240]  alex jones and for the network absolutely that that it's all vitally important and that we
[1:51:48.240 --> 1:51:54.000]  mutually reinforce one another uh in these trying times is particularly important so
[1:51:54.000 --> 1:51:59.920]  god bless you my god bless you take it away take care okay well i'm alan keys and we're
[1:51:59.920 --> 1:52:06.160]  going to be talking to you uh today a little bit about a number of things but one of them
[1:52:07.440 --> 1:52:11.600]  to start out with is i'm going to share with john michael chambers who is somebody by the way who if
[1:52:11.600 --> 1:52:17.040]  you don't know him is the author of a book called trump and the resurrection of america uh he has
[1:52:17.040 --> 1:52:21.760]  done a lot of writing and thinking about the significance of the trump phenomenon he was
[1:52:21.760 --> 1:52:26.560]  somebody who had actually given up on american politics and thought that it was just going to
[1:52:26.560 --> 1:52:32.000]  be alienated from the grassroots for good and all with the way things were going and then
[1:52:32.000 --> 1:52:38.000]  in 2016 uh i think trump surprised him a little bit and things look like we have a
[1:52:38.000 --> 1:52:45.840]  cope that they can be turned around in terms of disappointing nancy polosi's expectations
[1:52:45.840 --> 1:52:50.240]  that our elections aren't going to matter very much because they should be mattering a lot
[1:52:50.800 --> 1:52:55.600]  and once again i'm joined by my good friend uh and the inspiration by the way for i am tv
[1:52:55.600 --> 1:53:03.520]  which is the network where i broadcast my show uh let's talk america and we're going to be talking
[1:53:03.520 --> 1:53:09.840]  to john uh about the present situation uh where you're hearing all these things about purges going
[1:53:09.840 --> 1:53:16.080]  on at the white house i think what it actually amounts to is finally getting around after all
[1:53:16.080 --> 1:53:22.640]  of this shenanigans with the phony impeachment and all of this junk uh that don trump has finally
[1:53:22.640 --> 1:53:28.480]  been free to get around to the business of taking over the government of the united states you know
[1:53:28.480 --> 1:53:34.080]  presidents are supposed to do that uh so welcome to the show john it's it's great to have you on
[1:53:34.880 --> 1:53:42.480]  appreciate your being with us see there no yeah oh john will be with us in a moment oh there he is
[1:53:43.280 --> 1:53:51.440]  hi john how are you hi i'm good alan nice to see you and bob you're on info wars yeah yes indeed
[1:53:51.440 --> 1:53:58.320]  and and we're talking i think about one of the aspects of the warfare that's been going on
[1:53:58.320 --> 1:54:06.320]  politically in this country i find it strange that we're now being fated to a view that suggests
[1:54:06.320 --> 1:54:12.800]  that when the president goes about the business of making sure the white house is staffed with
[1:54:12.800 --> 1:54:20.640]  people who represent his policies and his point of view it's some kind of purge that's just the
[1:54:20.640 --> 1:54:27.920]  normal business of a new administration taking over these jokers are trying to get us to accept the
[1:54:27.920 --> 1:54:34.240]  notion that government should remain the same no matter what the result of an election i think
[1:54:34.240 --> 1:54:42.000]  that's crazy well it is crazy the deep state the democrats spin on this is is just that it's spin
[1:54:42.000 --> 1:54:48.000]  the president as you know has the right to to uh to choose uh people in certain positions
[1:54:48.000 --> 1:54:54.080]  and then the rest of us do that at the ballot box so if the democrats don't care for it well
[1:54:54.080 --> 1:54:59.680]  too bad i mean this is a purge if they think there's a purge going on right now wait'll they
[1:54:59.680 --> 1:55:07.360]  see what's coming well see i have been a little disturbed the other day i was doing um well it's
[1:55:07.360 --> 1:55:13.840]  extraneous what i was doing but i went to the page uh for i o which is the bureau and the state
[1:55:13.840 --> 1:55:19.680]  department that i used to head up uh international organizations and i was surprised to see that
[1:55:19.680 --> 1:55:27.200]  they still had an acting assistant secretary of state i mean here we are uh solid three years into
[1:55:27.200 --> 1:55:34.400]  the new administration and you don't have uh assistant secretary of state chosen by and
[1:55:34.400 --> 1:55:41.600]  reflecting the policies and viewpoint of the president reliably uh at least that was the
[1:55:41.600 --> 1:55:48.080]  impression i got uh i don't know but it seems to me that if that's going on at various levels of
[1:55:48.080 --> 1:55:53.520]  the government we've got a serious problem uh and that problem is a problem that is now being
[1:55:53.520 --> 1:55:59.200]  aggravated by all these democrats who are trying to give the impression that somehow or another
[1:55:59.840 --> 1:56:04.560]  election shouldn't matter very much and the government personnel should remain the same
[1:56:04.560 --> 1:56:10.800]  and so forth and so on where do they get this idea that that is not what's supposed to be happening
[1:56:10.800 --> 1:56:14.640]  after an election where the people decide they want to change of direction
[1:56:16.480 --> 1:56:20.400]  well because it's in their best interest because they have an awful lot to hide
[1:56:21.360 --> 1:56:26.880]  is the is the situation and they know what's coming because we're at the exposure
[1:56:28.240 --> 1:56:36.320]  a phase of draining the swamp we've exposing and now we've entered the next bit we're sort of in a
[1:56:36.320 --> 1:56:42.720]  shake down mode and soon the take down the hammer of justice and they know this is coming
[1:56:42.720 --> 1:56:48.160]  and so uh it doesn't surprise me uh that they they express their their views as such in terms of the
[1:56:48.160 --> 1:56:54.080]  purge but look gordon sonland was one of the purge right well well he was the no witness witness
[1:56:54.960 --> 1:57:02.240]  in the impeachment hoax in the house uh so hasta la vista and then you have uh you had the vinman
[1:57:02.240 --> 1:57:07.760]  in uh another beauty there to use one of trump's words uh he and his brother were escorted out
[1:57:08.320 --> 1:57:11.600]  and again this is the tip of the iceberg what people don't realize is there's been since trump's
[1:57:11.600 --> 1:57:17.840]  been in office over 13 000 global arrests corporate business government there's been over 100 there
[1:57:17.840 --> 1:57:27.040]  are over 147 926 i've got to have to when we come back let's explore that a little bit more in
[1:57:27.040 --> 1:57:33.280]  detail and i'll try to explain why i take such exception to the word purge because i think it
[1:57:33.280 --> 1:57:39.280]  it is just beyond the pale for me of the words that we should be using to describe what is happening
[1:57:39.280 --> 1:57:48.320]  after one of our free elections we'll be right back real stuff man we're talking about the real
[1:57:48.320 --> 1:57:52.720]  deal here and i and i love trump all day long but man i tell you he sits here and lets these big tech
[1:57:52.720 --> 1:57:57.600]  people keep running roughshod over and everybody i i mean i've got a problem and we'll just take
[1:57:57.600 --> 1:58:02.400]  the trump rallies over that said about two months ago i came with a plan that i haven't launched yet
[1:58:02.400 --> 1:58:08.160]  we have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers 20 different stickers impeach the
[1:58:08.160 --> 1:58:13.200]  democrats save the second amendment defend the first amendment info wars dot com and it looks
[1:58:13.200 --> 1:58:17.200]  like duct tape it's just a regular sticker you put it over your mouth you go to a trump rally
[1:58:17.200 --> 1:58:21.440]  and you instantly take over without even disrupting things people say why are you doing this what's
[1:58:21.440 --> 1:58:25.600]  happening when you go well we're being censored you know trump won't do anything about it and
[1:58:25.600 --> 1:58:28.880]  dr pochetic i'm let me just ask you what you think because i've not launched this yet it's
[1:58:28.880 --> 1:58:35.680]  brilliant you've taken the very element that they try to repress you with that silence and made it
[1:58:35.680 --> 1:58:41.520]  into a weapon you have the loudest sound of all silence and you know what's most disturbing to
[1:58:41.520 --> 1:58:49.200]  people silence silence silence i love watching david night in the morning i love tuning in to
[1:58:49.200 --> 1:58:54.560]  oh and shroyer i love all the other shows we do here but i'll be honest with you we run during
[1:58:54.560 --> 1:59:00.240]  the breaks a lot of news reports because i'm sick of hearing the ads so you think you don't want to
[1:59:00.240 --> 1:59:05.360]  hear an ad i don't want to hear an ad but here's the bottom line we're barely paying the bills here
[1:59:05.360 --> 1:59:10.240]  and i want to expand the face the globalists not contract i don't want them to win so listen you've
[1:59:10.240 --> 1:59:16.160]  got this guarantee from me we saw enough product we'll have less ads and less plugs and we'll expand
[1:59:16.160 --> 1:59:20.640]  and really give the globals run for their money but we've got products you already really need

[1:59:39.520 --> 1:59:52.320]  action now and fund the info war for your own future you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:59:52.320 --> 2:00:10.560]  welcome back now i want to spend a second or two to explain why it is i'm so sensitive about
[2:00:10.560 --> 2:00:15.920]  this word purge because i'm i'm part of that generation that came along thinking of this
[2:00:15.920 --> 2:00:21.200]  is the united states of america you'll forgive me for that right we're not this we're not the socialist
[2:00:21.200 --> 2:00:26.640]  republics of america we're not the communist party of america none of this junk that is now being
[2:00:27.360 --> 2:00:33.120]  offered us on the table which i consider to be poisoned for the body politic of the united
[2:00:33.120 --> 2:00:39.120]  states none of that was in the air uh it was by and large taken for granted that on a bipartisan
[2:00:39.120 --> 2:00:46.480]  basis we all were against turning this country into one of those regimented communist party regimes
[2:00:46.480 --> 2:00:51.600]  that only looked like they had elections but where things didn't really change until the
[2:00:51.600 --> 2:00:57.920]  infighting was done among a little group of people who actually ran the country this is how a lot of
[2:00:57.920 --> 2:01:01.360]  these politicians and i have to say they're particularly a lot of democrats but you see a
[2:01:01.360 --> 2:01:06.480]  little bit of that on both sides of the other they want us now to get into this mentality to get used
[2:01:06.480 --> 2:01:12.000]  to living in a country that has this communist parlance going on and i can't stand it we don't
[2:01:12.000 --> 2:01:18.640]  have purges in america we have elections and after elections changes will be made to reflect what will
[2:01:18.640 --> 2:01:26.000]  be if it is appropriate after the election changes in policy that the people have decided by deciding
[2:01:26.000 --> 2:01:32.000]  who they want to represent them in the white house and that being the case they're perfectly normal
[2:01:32.000 --> 2:01:36.880]  it's not some abnormal abuse of power i know these people have been trying to give this impression
[2:01:36.880 --> 2:01:44.080]  but it's not at all why they think that they have the prerogative of making sure that the president
[2:01:44.080 --> 2:01:51.520]  has to work with people who don't accept his policies is beyond me but he not only should be
[2:01:51.520 --> 2:01:57.760]  working to make sure he has such people it is perfectly okay and it's essential to making sure
[2:01:57.760 --> 2:02:03.280]  that the election is actually reflected in the way the government changes and things have been
[2:02:03.280 --> 2:02:08.960]  belated they've been trying to delay this process and confuse this process ever since
[2:02:08.960 --> 2:02:13.280]  trump got into office and it's not a good thing for america am i wrong about that john
[2:02:15.200 --> 2:02:20.480]  you're 100 accurate and spot on i mean what's happening is is the draining of the swamp as
[2:02:20.480 --> 2:02:26.640]  i was explaining is exposure take down shake down what we have happening here and they're not used
[2:02:26.640 --> 2:02:33.440]  to it it's the rule of law the rule of law reset is returning to america and they're panicking they're
[2:02:33.440 --> 2:02:39.440]  panicking thus false flags and so forth and so on but but look it's just be just getting started
[2:02:39.440 --> 2:02:45.520]  you know don't forget let let us know there's been over at least 22 firings and or resignations
[2:02:45.520 --> 2:02:50.320]  within the fbi just since president donald trump's been in office and we're just getting started
[2:02:50.320 --> 2:02:55.760]  again as as as lindsay graham just stated and it's the paraphrase but he said about 50 percent of those
[2:02:55.760 --> 2:03:02.560]  people involved in the russian hoax are going to jail and lindsay graham is conducting in the senate
[2:03:02.560 --> 2:03:09.520]  judiciary hearings he told us of course he's test 21 people are going to be called in to testify
[2:03:09.520 --> 2:03:14.000]  and these are the people that we finally want to see on the carpet under oath things are about to
[2:03:14.000 --> 2:03:18.960]  get very very real my friends at info wars very real something we've been waiting for uh because
[2:03:18.960 --> 2:03:24.800]  well you know i'm is that a stuff you have been talking to me and to us about that on on uh let's
[2:03:24.800 --> 2:03:31.040]  talk america for quite a while uh and i think things were postponed a little bit by all of the
[2:03:31.040 --> 2:03:37.840]  furor that was created by the phony impeachment process and the whole way that that uh sad sham
[2:03:37.840 --> 2:03:45.120]  was handled uh but i'm hoping that uh election upcoming election notwithstanding the president's
[2:03:45.120 --> 2:03:51.280]  getting down to business and make the business of making sure uh that this administration has a good
[2:03:51.280 --> 2:03:58.000]  hold on the government and will continue to take it in the right direction uh in spite of what some
[2:03:58.000 --> 2:04:03.760]  people think ought to be the dominance of our government by the elements of the deep state
[2:04:03.760 --> 2:04:09.040]  that have already shown that they have no particular loyalty to down trump but what's more important
[2:04:09.040 --> 2:04:14.960]  they have no particular loyalty to the constitution to the integrity of our process of our national
[2:04:14.960 --> 2:04:22.240]  security or of the respect that is owed to due process and truth in the justice system we're
[2:04:22.240 --> 2:04:28.400]  seeing it infect everything now uh including the judicial process and other things that are going on
[2:04:28.400 --> 2:04:35.360]  where biases are being confessed and admitted that simply shouldn't be part of our judicial
[2:04:35.360 --> 2:04:51.280]  process we'll get more in depth into that right after this
[2:04:54.800 --> 2:05:01.360]  the evidence is overwhelming coronavirus is a man-made bio weapon designed to destroy nation
[2:05:01.360 --> 2:05:07.920]  states economies and free peoples and usher in a planetary government this is how the globalists
[2:05:07.920 --> 2:05:14.560]  are striking back here's a fortune headline today fears of global coronavirus contagion rage as
[2:05:14.560 --> 2:05:21.920]  3 000 cruise ship passengers return home and that's just in one nation coronavirus deals
[2:05:21.920 --> 2:05:29.360]  major blow to german car factories in china the reporting it could cut their sales in half this

[2:05:38.960 --> 2:05:44.400]  info wars will continue to report the latest information as it comes out regardless of the
[2:05:44.400 --> 2:05:49.200]  fact that the establishment will try to punish us for telling the truth we need you to step
[2:05:49.200 --> 2:06:05.120]  into the plate and help spread the word about band on video and info wars dot com today
[2:06:06.160 --> 2:06:14.480]  info wars dot com is tomorrow's news today you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:06:14.480 --> 2:06:24.640]  you welcome back i am so glad that i am working today in the context of alex jones
[2:06:24.640 --> 2:06:29.440]  and info wars i'm especially glad because with all this coronavirus thing going on
[2:06:30.160 --> 2:06:35.680]  it's good to be working for folks who are in the business of helping people both take care of their
[2:06:35.680 --> 2:06:41.920]  health in the normal course of things but also becoming increasingly aware of the environment
[2:06:41.920 --> 2:06:48.640]  that we are now in and operating in where people might need to know that you don't have to rely on
[2:06:48.640 --> 2:06:55.680]  what appears to be an increasingly questionable system you can get the kind of information you
[2:06:55.680 --> 2:07:01.280]  need to take control of your health of your weight and also to deal with things like the coronavirus
[2:07:01.280 --> 2:07:07.840]  when it comes down to it understand it better but also to deal with it and that's part of why i feel
[2:07:07.840 --> 2:07:13.600]  that we're in the right place at the right time now what do you think about well absolutely and
[2:07:13.600 --> 2:07:18.880]  we have all these great products that we get from uh info wars we also get stuff from mike
[2:07:18.880 --> 2:07:25.360]  adams too we love mike but uh i wanted to ask uh john michael because before you do that though i
[2:07:25.360 --> 2:07:30.000]  have to particularly i said it yesterday but i want to particularly repeat that when i'm talking
[2:07:30.000 --> 2:07:34.560]  about these products i have always been in the habit when i was doing radio and everything else i
[2:07:34.560 --> 2:07:40.400]  don't talk about products till i use them and i've been using the alex jones products and i have
[2:07:40.400 --> 2:07:49.040]  to tell you i am really impressed with the effect that they have uh with the efficacy of both the
[2:07:49.040 --> 2:07:54.400]  vitamin packs that i've been taking i've been using uh the colloidal silver the toothpaste right
[2:07:54.400 --> 2:08:01.680]  right it has been uh working wonders so i hope that y'all will know that this isn't just a matter of
[2:08:01.680 --> 2:08:05.520]  you know promoting things because i'm sitting here and feel like i owe it to the folks who are
[2:08:05.520 --> 2:08:12.080]  sponsoring brand no i think we owe it to you to share this with you because part of the truth
[2:08:12.080 --> 2:08:17.360]  about the universe that you're drawn into when you're watching info wars is that trying to
[2:08:17.360 --> 2:08:24.240]  communicate with people to give them both truth and substantive products that help you to take
[2:08:24.240 --> 2:08:29.840]  charge of your life remember this is supposed to be government of buy and for the people
[2:08:29.840 --> 2:08:33.680]  but everything that goes on now all the messages they're beaming at you
[2:08:33.680 --> 2:08:39.040]  are leading people to think i'll just passively wait till somebody spoon feeds me the answer
[2:08:39.040 --> 2:08:43.840]  that's not what info wars is about it's not what we're about bob and i and i hope it's not what
[2:08:43.840 --> 2:08:49.200]  you're about anymore because we need to be active now you are going to talk well i wanted to uh
[2:08:49.200 --> 2:08:55.600]  ask john michael he's got his uh pin on uh john michael is that a uh q pin you have
[2:08:55.600 --> 2:09:01.200]  well it's the american flag with the letter q in it yes i would be correct
[2:09:01.760 --> 2:09:09.360]  hey now this is the same pin the same pin that donald trump jr uh war on uh
[2:09:09.360 --> 2:09:15.440]  tucker colson and and eric wore on on laura ingram and the two people at the um
[2:09:17.200 --> 2:09:21.520]  guests of honor if you will at the state of the union also had their q pins on so
[2:09:21.520 --> 2:09:27.120]  we're in a q pin today yeah but i wanted to bring that up because alex is like a lot of
[2:09:27.120 --> 2:09:32.320]  americans we're very frustrated about what hasn't happened yet and i wanted to plug your book a
[2:09:32.320 --> 2:09:37.840]  little bit because your book talks about the 10 step program or 12 whatever it is but that we're
[2:09:37.840 --> 2:09:42.880]  we're getting on down there now we're getting close to un unleashed in a bunch of the sealed
[2:09:42.880 --> 2:09:49.200]  indictments things that you've been talking about for a long time and you give q a lot of uh uh credit
[2:09:49.200 --> 2:09:55.600]  for for what you know and uh well you need to ask spend a moment or two for folks and
[2:09:55.600 --> 2:09:59.920]  alex john's audience who might or might not know uh what is the significance of the pin
[2:10:02.320 --> 2:10:09.360]  well q stands for q and on which is uh highly controversial um the fact that cnn tells everyone
[2:10:09.360 --> 2:10:14.240]  not to be looking at q tells me we should probably be looking at q they try to discredit it but these
[2:10:14.240 --> 2:10:19.040]  are the same people that brought to us the fact that donald trump is a russian spy so i don't
[2:10:19.040 --> 2:10:23.840]  uh hold much credence to what they say but look q and on if people do the homework in the research
[2:10:23.840 --> 2:10:32.800]  is the most intelligent military intel operation in modern history um and uh and so uh i decided
[2:10:32.800 --> 2:10:39.520]  to wear my q pin um why not spread the word about q but we don't want what's yes we certainly have
[2:10:39.520 --> 2:10:46.160]  been in need in the last little while of getting information to try to make heads or tails of what's
[2:10:46.160 --> 2:10:51.360]  going on with this coronavirus now i know that like everything else you try to stay on top of
[2:10:51.360 --> 2:10:58.960]  things like that what's your sense of what's actually going on now uh with uh the coronavirus
[2:10:58.960 --> 2:11:07.120]  its origins and uh its potential impact but also i would say its significance in terms of the
[2:11:07.120 --> 2:11:12.080]  pressures that are being brought now against donald trump against the united states against our system
[2:11:12.080 --> 2:11:19.120]  of self-government what's happening everything has failed all the coup day attempts hoax and
[2:11:19.120 --> 2:11:24.720]  shams from the beginning we don't need to name them alex audience knows very well uh the these
[2:11:24.720 --> 2:11:29.600]  things have failed so now they're ramping up uh the game uh because they know they can't be
[2:11:30.160 --> 2:11:36.880]  trump in 2020 i couldn't agree with alex more on the fact that the coronavirus is is a man made
[2:11:36.880 --> 2:11:43.760]  weapon uh to do the ultimate takeover population reduction so forth and so on but you know info
[2:11:43.760 --> 2:11:48.400]  war yes it's also an intelligence war an intelligence battle and i'm going to very quickly
[2:11:48.400 --> 2:11:53.680]  and calmly connect the dots because you know i don't watch a lot of sports and i certainly don't
[2:11:53.680 --> 2:12:00.880]  watch a lot of hollywood but i'll tell you what here's what i watch we have here lindsey grams
[2:12:00.880 --> 2:12:07.280]  judiciary senate hearings pulling in 21 people to test the fire under oath about what about the
[2:12:07.280 --> 2:12:13.200]  fiza warrants how they were obtained about how the dossier was came to be and was funded
[2:12:13.200 --> 2:12:19.040]  in there is everything we need number two we have the federal death penalty reinstated by
[2:12:19.040 --> 2:12:23.280]  attorney general bar what other dot would we like to connect as reported by i believe the
[2:12:23.280 --> 2:12:28.720]  washington times last year and i wrote an article on it on my website john michael chambers dot com
[2:12:28.720 --> 2:12:37.520]  about gitmo gitmo uh they're talking about uh gitmo tribunals being live streamed then we have
[2:12:37.520 --> 2:12:42.400]  of course wine steen uh is now going to more than likely serve the rest of his days in jail
[2:12:42.400 --> 2:12:48.800]  epstein was suicided small that's now been indicted on six felony charges inspector general one
[2:12:48.800 --> 2:12:54.800]  labeled comey a liar and a leaker we're going to come after him we at ig2 exposes fiza we're
[2:12:54.800 --> 2:13:00.000]  now taking at the next step rudy juliani's files is going to bury biden and every one of the
[2:13:00.000 --> 2:13:04.960]  dead bodies in the ukraine uh because it's now reached attorney general bar's desk officially
[2:13:04.960 --> 2:13:09.680]  coming into the government so this is what's happening while while we're being distracted
[2:13:09.680 --> 2:13:15.360]  by false flags and all the noise from the deep state the democrats in the fake news media these
[2:13:15.360 --> 2:13:20.960]  are the dots to be connecting the stage is being set and justice is coming i know a lot of americans
[2:13:20.960 --> 2:13:25.120]  believe the big names will never be taken down well you know what i beg to differ because here's the
[2:13:25.120 --> 2:13:31.760]  bottom line it's either us or them that's where we are in this battle and we didn't come this far
[2:13:31.760 --> 2:13:35.760]  with all the things that trump has accomplished with all the barriers that that he's overcome and
[2:13:35.760 --> 2:13:40.720]  we're still fighting many battles as you know i believe we come out winners we are winning i just
[2:13:40.720 --> 2:13:45.600]  connected the dots on a few things that should be on mainstream news news every night and in fact
[2:13:45.600 --> 2:13:53.520]  aren't so and i also believe that the the economy will survive the the attack that it's under right
[2:13:53.520 --> 2:13:59.520]  now and this attack with coronavirus goes far beyond the economic issue but that's a big piece of it
[2:13:59.520 --> 2:14:04.960]  but remember who's controlling the fed unofficially right now donald trump what is the fed i mean
[2:14:04.960 --> 2:14:10.720]  they're falling for the trap now that the rates have to come down even further isn't that kind of
[2:14:10.720 --> 2:14:16.960]  nice uh in this year later on there's a whole nother talk to have in the economy but i believe
[2:14:16.960 --> 2:14:21.840]  we're going to win this battle and uh they're evil they're monsters and they're trying to take over
[2:14:21.840 --> 2:14:27.520]  the world and that's what this weaponization is all about and like everything else this one too is
[2:14:27.520 --> 2:14:32.080]  going to fail and i can't wait to hear what the president has to say in his briefing tonight um
[2:14:32.080 --> 2:14:36.080]  but i think he's going to calm the fears calm the nerves and we're going to get through this america
[2:14:36.080 --> 2:14:40.960]  we're going to get through this one too well i noticed a while back and i think i've mentioned
[2:14:40.960 --> 2:14:48.080]  it um on this air before that when the president talked to uh jijin ping back in january end of
[2:14:48.080 --> 2:14:56.480]  january as the coronavirus thing was uh rearing its head um he said uh or reported in in one of
[2:14:56.480 --> 2:15:03.120]  his tweets uh and it was a statement that i think he was making in which he said uh that he thought
[2:15:03.120 --> 2:15:09.600]  that this would abate start abating when the weather got warmer uh implying i think a connection
[2:15:09.600 --> 2:15:17.600]  between uh the uh coronavirus strain that we're dealing with and hot weather i've noticed reports
[2:15:17.600 --> 2:15:23.200]  coming out that suggest and i don't know whether it's because of inadequate reporting or because
[2:15:23.200 --> 2:15:28.800]  of the climate that south america and africa haven't been very hard hit and that's an interesting
[2:15:28.800 --> 2:15:35.200]  thing if it correlates in terms of the fact that a lot of the country's there or on the equator
[2:15:35.200 --> 2:15:43.440]  you're dealing with a climate where folks are dealing with hotter temperatures longer throughout
[2:15:43.440 --> 2:15:48.640]  more of the year except in certain parts of south america and so it could be an interesting
[2:15:48.640 --> 2:15:55.520]  correlation we'll get in to more and all of that right after we get back we can all agree these are
[2:15:55.520 --> 2:16:01.680]  troubled times right so do you know who's on your wireless network whether it's a big company selling

[2:19:53.200 --> 2:20:03.200]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:20:12.800 --> 2:20:20.720]  we're back we've been talking about a range of things but a lot of it has to do with what is
[2:20:20.720 --> 2:20:28.560]  going on that impacts the environment that we'll be dealing with as we run up to the election
[2:20:29.280 --> 2:20:34.080]  and i think a lot of forces are at work you've probably noticed we have been watching it for
[2:20:34.080 --> 2:20:40.400]  weeks months even as they try to create an environment that's deeply prejudiced against
[2:20:40.400 --> 2:20:45.760]  president trump in all kinds of ways but then you have to also think about the events that are
[2:20:45.760 --> 2:20:51.760]  taking place and john what is your sense given the what's been happening on the stock market it
[2:20:51.760 --> 2:20:58.880]  appears to be be related to the corona virus outbreak now i have been listening to mike
[2:20:58.880 --> 2:21:06.160]  adams and to alex and to others and it looks to me like we have to factor in as a good possibility
[2:21:06.880 --> 2:21:13.360]  that we are in fact going to see a domestic effect whether it's actually in terms of communal
[2:21:13.360 --> 2:21:17.920]  outbreaks i noticed that one official was warning the american people that we have to
[2:21:17.920 --> 2:21:23.200]  brace ourselves for outbreaks of the corona virus in our communities since they haven't
[2:21:23.200 --> 2:21:29.040]  really been handing out these test kits it seems to me that they might be priming the pump
[2:21:29.040 --> 2:21:34.320]  to make sure we get some such outbreaks that will then perhaps panic the public a little bit
[2:21:35.120 --> 2:21:40.080]  but at the same time what's happening with the stock market could potentially panic people in
[2:21:40.080 --> 2:21:48.960]  terms of economic prospects and that has its own kind of domino effect on the stock market
[2:21:49.520 --> 2:21:56.160]  and on the economy at large what's your sense of what this whole corona virus episode is about
[2:21:56.800 --> 2:22:01.120]  and what effect it's going to have on the environment in which the american people
[2:22:01.120 --> 2:22:07.680]  are heading toward this very critical election in november it's a great question and dr keys
[2:22:07.680 --> 2:22:12.800]  we've spoken about this on your program but you know it's a direct answer to your question
[2:22:13.360 --> 2:22:19.680]  problem reaction solution it's textbook create they you know we we know who they is they create
[2:22:19.680 --> 2:22:26.000]  the problem right corona virus they anticipate the action reaction fear and then the solution is
[2:22:26.000 --> 2:22:30.960]  what well vaccinations right and and all these other control mechanisms now they're hitting
[2:22:30.960 --> 2:22:36.960]  the economy my point on the economy is is yes i mean look the dow dropped 2000 points it's up a bit
[2:22:36.960 --> 2:22:42.000]  today we'll see what happens but this is this isn't over because supply chains as we know have
[2:22:42.000 --> 2:22:47.040]  been disrupted because the factory workers aren't working in china and so forth and this is a global
[2:22:47.040 --> 2:22:51.200]  issue because we're globally connected another reason why we want to make our own goods here
[2:22:51.200 --> 2:22:56.000]  and sell them but uh that's a different subject but look we well you know on that though before you
[2:22:56.000 --> 2:23:02.000]  go ahead i noticed a couple of articles where people were talking about the fact that because
[2:23:02.000 --> 2:23:10.320]  we had had this exchange shall we say with the chinese entree and there had been sanctions
[2:23:10.320 --> 2:23:17.040]  there had been their reaction and people were all kind of looking warily at what might very well
[2:23:17.040 --> 2:23:23.760]  be a disruption of the supply chain don't you think that all of that happening over the course
[2:23:23.760 --> 2:23:30.480]  of several months people were already thinking ahead to discount the possibility that we were
[2:23:30.480 --> 2:23:37.200]  going to have to deal with these supply chain disruptions with china well yes but there's
[2:23:37.200 --> 2:23:42.640]  going to be a delay you know from from lack of production and export and so on i think there's
[2:23:42.640 --> 2:23:48.080]  going to be some issues and look a lot of people have speculated this may be their final way to
[2:23:48.080 --> 2:23:55.520]  help take uh due to potentially derail trump's electability by taking the markets down now but
[2:23:55.520 --> 2:24:00.000]  trump does seem to have a magic one i think we'll work our way out of this uh but but you know this
[2:24:00.000 --> 2:24:03.840]  you know we just saw the drop dow dropped 2000 points i think that what they're doing right
[2:24:03.840 --> 2:24:08.640]  now is they're scaring the hell out of americans because because right now obviously the travel
[2:24:08.640 --> 2:24:14.560]  industry has been hit very hard other sectors have been hard hit hard but if they get us to the
[2:24:14.560 --> 2:24:18.320]  point of fear where people don't just live their life the way they do that's how you really take
[2:24:18.320 --> 2:24:22.240]  the economy down people don't go to movies people don't go to conventions people don't go out and
[2:24:22.240 --> 2:24:26.400]  spend money in malls and that's a problem i think the president may very well address this this
[2:24:26.400 --> 2:24:31.040]  evening but um you know so they're very smart they're very evil uh and they know that we're
[2:24:31.040 --> 2:24:36.640]  coming after them and that's why they're they're ramping up their efforts uh this is this is evil
[2:24:36.640 --> 2:24:43.280]  rearing its ugly ugly face um i think there could be underlying it all though a positive note
[2:24:44.080 --> 2:24:50.720]  because i have been watching with some concern and it's over years now uh that more and more giving
[2:24:50.720 --> 2:24:56.320]  the your your head the head to whether it's the technical companies or other companies uh investing
[2:24:56.320 --> 2:25:07.920]  themselves in uh the chinese economy in various ways and becoming increasingly dependent i think
[2:25:07.920 --> 2:25:13.920]  that this whole business whether it's the discussion over trade and president trump's determined
[2:25:13.920 --> 2:25:20.080]  effort to get fairness for us in terms of that trade relationship or this little warning that
[2:25:20.080 --> 2:25:26.160]  we're getting which could turn into a more serious warning uh that we can't afford to become a nation
[2:25:26.800 --> 2:25:33.440]  that is dependent on others in these critical respects and we don't have to uh and don't
[2:25:33.440 --> 2:25:40.800]  you think that's actually a kind of silver lining uh in this cloud if people really start thinking
[2:25:40.800 --> 2:25:47.520]  about the fact uh that we need to remain a people that has both our own productive capacities
[2:25:47.520 --> 2:25:53.440]  but also has diversified our sources and resources in a way that helps to keep our economy healthy
[2:25:55.120 --> 2:25:58.960]  yeah these are great points and there's this additional silver linings in there just like
[2:25:58.960 --> 2:26:03.680]  we look back on everything the cavanaugh thing imploded the mule witch hunt imploded then they
[2:26:03.680 --> 2:26:07.520]  brought out mule look like from his casket to try and salvage it and that imploded then they had the
[2:26:07.520 --> 2:26:12.480]  impeachment hoax and stormy daniels and avanade and so forth and so on this is going to backfire too
[2:26:12.480 --> 2:26:17.120]  to the point that you've just made making the point come back home and manufacture here number
[2:26:17.120 --> 2:26:22.320]  one number two um i mean you can go you can go on and on with the benefits here's another benefit
[2:26:23.280 --> 2:26:28.080]  the federal reserve is lowering rates isn't that what trump's been asking the fed to do
[2:26:28.080 --> 2:26:33.200]  he's been asking the fed to do that to keep his economy going playing their rig system against
[2:26:33.200 --> 2:26:39.040]  them to make sure that the economy the markets stay intact for the electability but come 2020
[2:26:39.920 --> 2:26:45.360]  after the 2020 landslide by president trump the global financial reset that is going to really
[2:26:45.360 --> 2:26:51.760]  accelerate um taking the power away from the central bank monetary system and returning it back
[2:26:51.760 --> 2:26:57.840]  to we the people and this is playing right into that just the same but listen no pain no gain
[2:26:57.840 --> 2:27:01.920]  and we certainly didn't i didn't expect this of course but most of us didn't this corona virus
[2:27:01.920 --> 2:27:06.400]  thing to hit although there was a book written back in 1981 if i got the author that's commented
[2:27:06.400 --> 2:27:12.480]  very specifically about what's happening right now well in a novel but i'm pretty sure myself
[2:27:12.480 --> 2:27:19.280]  that we can look forward to a talk tonight from president trump that's going to accentuate the
[2:27:19.280 --> 2:27:24.960]  positive uh because i think that that's not only essential at the moment but it's a reflection
[2:27:24.960 --> 2:27:33.120]  of our real and actual potential so long as we react with prudence and with the kind of common
[2:27:33.120 --> 2:27:38.160]  scent that americans are certainly still capable of showing to everything that's now happening in
[2:27:38.160 --> 2:27:43.520]  the world and i think that everything that's going on alex jones and people trying in spite
[2:27:43.520 --> 2:27:48.560]  of china's reluctance in spite of the overall reluctance now of the whole health sector to
[2:27:48.560 --> 2:27:54.400]  be honest about what's going on i think that that's the key to the kind of reaction we need
[2:27:54.400 --> 2:28:00.400]  well i would love it if president trump tonight was up to speed and was to announce that there's
[2:28:00.400 --> 2:28:06.720]  an inexpensive product that's going to be talked about tomorrow on alex jones that will explain
[2:28:06.720 --> 2:28:12.000]  to everybody how you can make in your own little kitchen what you need to kill the corona thing and
[2:28:12.000 --> 2:28:17.040]  not even have to worry but i don't expect him to know that tonight maybe he'll do another thing
[2:28:17.040 --> 2:28:21.280]  tomorrow night and explain that after he watches alex jones tomorrow well that's a great teaser
[2:28:24.880 --> 2:28:31.840]  so anyway i think that we are in the midst of a time that is that combination bad guys are at
[2:28:31.840 --> 2:28:39.360]  work but very often america has reacted to pressure existential pressure in a way that shows whether
[2:28:39.360 --> 2:28:45.760]  it's wars or peace or economic development uh that once you give the american people the right
[2:28:45.760 --> 2:28:50.160]  information and give them their head we're more than capable of coping with the circumstances
[2:28:50.160 --> 2:28:57.440]  and we will again uh more of that attention gcn self-reliance listeners if you've ever wanted
[2:28:57.440 --> 2:29:02.320]  an emergency solar survival backup system but we're waiting for prices too crazy to pass up

[2:29:20.960 --> 2:29:25.280]  move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move it back to the
[2:29:25.280 --> 2:29:30.080]  warehouse we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't

[2:36:28.080 --> 2:36:34.240]  we have been talking in the course of our recent discussion about this whole coronavirus
[2:36:34.240 --> 2:36:46.880]  environment and what it portends i was reading an article about a us health official who has been
[2:36:46.880 --> 2:36:52.240]  telling americans that they should and i'm reading now should prepare for community spread of the
[2:36:52.240 --> 2:36:58.080]  new coronavirus with families sitting down and explaining that there could be very well be a
[2:36:58.080 --> 2:37:06.560]  rapid sudden increase in the number of patients a top u.s. health official has said this would
[2:37:06.560 --> 2:37:14.240]  have been yesterday in an escalation from previous warnings dr. Nancy Messonnier director of the
[2:37:14.240 --> 2:37:18.240]  centers for disease control and prevention national center for immunization and respiratory
[2:37:18.240 --> 2:37:24.560]  diseases said americans should prepare for their lives to be disrupted by the spread of the new
[2:37:24.560 --> 2:37:35.360]  virus including closure of schools and businesses and from what i've been hearing here on on mic
[2:37:35.360 --> 2:37:41.040]  adam show and other places this is an interesting almost a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy that's
[2:37:41.040 --> 2:37:46.160]  the problem with dealing with government these days in that because when they tell you something's
[2:37:46.160 --> 2:37:50.080]  going to happen it used to be the case that this is because it was an emergency it's an event that's
[2:37:50.080 --> 2:37:54.320]  happening it's happening to us and then we're going to be controlling it doing our level best
[2:37:54.320 --> 2:37:58.000]  to deal with it and so forth and so on and then when you start to look now behind the
[2:37:58.000 --> 2:38:04.640]  scene what's going on well part of the reason that it may be a sudden outbreak is because
[2:38:04.640 --> 2:38:09.280]  they actually haven't been doing everything they need to be doing to make sure we're testing
[2:38:09.280 --> 2:38:15.440]  and quarantining in the way that we might do to avoid this kind of bloom right so that it
[2:38:15.440 --> 2:38:20.400]  comes up all of a sudden and then we all have to deal with it etc now it's nice that we're
[2:38:20.400 --> 2:38:26.720]  getting this warning but it implies something that goes beyond the corona virus and yet we live
[2:38:26.720 --> 2:38:33.280]  in a time when we're not being prepared for this at all okay what she's saying has a lot to do with
[2:38:33.280 --> 2:38:39.440]  how you're going to take responsibility for yourself everything about the present juncture
[2:38:39.440 --> 2:38:43.200]  including what's going on in our politics all these people coming forward say socialism
[2:38:43.200 --> 2:38:46.480]  government's going to take care of government will take care of your education government will take
[2:38:46.480 --> 2:38:51.360]  care of your kids government will even take care of your kids behind your back so that they know
[2:38:51.360 --> 2:38:56.880]  stuff that you don't want them to know about sex and everything else they're taking away the
[2:38:56.880 --> 2:39:03.680]  initiative from the american people at the same time that one could argue they're helping to set
[2:39:03.680 --> 2:39:11.200]  the stage for a crisis that requires a lot that you take the initiative and taking care of yourself
[2:39:11.200 --> 2:39:16.480]  that you take the initiative in dealing with the situation that's going on you think it's is that
[2:39:16.480 --> 2:39:22.640]  going to really work why are they doing these contradictory things i think we need to be
[2:39:22.640 --> 2:39:29.520]  thinking this through because the challenge that's involved here goes beyond health and has to do
[2:39:29.520 --> 2:39:36.480]  with the mentality that is now being encouraged in the population of the united states a kind of
[2:39:36.480 --> 2:39:42.320]  passive government's going to do it for your mentality going hand in hand and i remember
[2:39:42.320 --> 2:39:47.440]  i've heard people talk about this spot and they say that you know what's needed in this country
[2:39:47.440 --> 2:39:53.040]  we need a crisis we need a crisis so the americans will wake up and do this and do that and it looks
[2:39:53.040 --> 2:40:01.680]  like they're putting one together am i wrong john problem reaction solution false flag season
[2:40:01.680 --> 2:40:06.880]  trump's about to win another election people well i'm not talking about trump winning now
[2:40:06.880 --> 2:40:11.680]  we're going to get off the topic of trump winning or losing because at some point americans need to
[2:40:11.680 --> 2:40:16.400]  remember that what's really important in this country is whether we are winning or losing our
[2:40:16.400 --> 2:40:22.160]  country okay after trump is no longer president there's still going to be a challenge to our
[2:40:22.160 --> 2:40:28.080]  posterity and that challenge is supposed to be government of by and for the people sustained
[2:40:28.080 --> 2:40:34.640]  through our constitutional system can a passive people regimented to believe that the government
[2:40:34.640 --> 2:40:38.800]  takes the initiative and you do what they tell you and the government takes the initiative and
[2:40:38.800 --> 2:40:42.720]  they give you your education the government takes the initiative they create your future and the
[2:40:42.720 --> 2:40:46.560]  government takes the initiative and they take care of your children they educate your children
[2:40:46.560 --> 2:40:50.880]  and they take care of your family are we going to be a free people when they get done with all of this
[2:40:50.880 --> 2:40:59.000]  or I wonder because I think the real challenge is are we accepting the challenge of taking
[2:40:59.000 --> 2:41:04.680]  responsibility for ourselves? What do you think? Well, I think it ties right hand in
[2:41:04.680 --> 2:41:09.760]  hand to your point. I take your point is well taken and critical. It goes when you
[2:41:09.760 --> 2:41:13.280]  look at the freak show we just saw the other night with a bunch of bees. We had booty judge
[2:41:13.280 --> 2:41:18.800]  and Biden and Bernie and Bloomberg, a whole lot of bees up there. That's what they want.
[2:41:18.800 --> 2:41:24.880]  What they don't want are free people, critical thinking people to take responsibility of
[2:41:24.880 --> 2:41:29.040]  themselves and their lives and their communities and so forth. So they've got this whole platform
[2:41:29.040 --> 2:41:33.160]  to say, well, come over here. We're going to take care of everything. It's the big government
[2:41:33.160 --> 2:41:38.800]  plan, as you well know, and it's backfiring. I think the point you're raising is something
[2:41:38.800 --> 2:41:45.000]  that's going to take some time and life after Trump should be the title of my next book.
[2:41:45.000 --> 2:41:48.480]  But I would like to get this in if I can real quick because it's the biggest news story
[2:41:48.480 --> 2:41:53.240]  that didn't make the news. May 24th, 2019. And it's pertinent to right where we're heading
[2:41:53.240 --> 2:42:00.080]  today and immediate tomorrows before us. The biggest news story is Constitution states
[2:42:00.080 --> 2:42:05.280]  that the punishment for treason is execution. A reporter asked this to the president at
[2:42:05.280 --> 2:42:11.080]  the Agriculture Briefing and he said, you, sir, have accused your adversaries of treason.
[2:42:11.080 --> 2:42:15.400]  Do you care to name them? And Trump said, sure, you have to look at Comey, Stroke, Page,
[2:42:15.400 --> 2:42:20.240]  McCabe, Clapper and others, others much higher up than that. This is the president talking
[2:42:20.240 --> 2:42:25.560]  about treason, naming people in the Department of Justice and the FBI and citing the Constitution.
[2:42:25.560 --> 2:42:31.480]  When we get back, when we get back, yes. I think we can get into a discussion of that.
[2:42:31.480 --> 2:42:38.280]  I think it's a fairly complex point and it has to do with my neurology about talking
[2:42:38.280 --> 2:42:43.160]  about purges and doing other things like this. But we can get into that. I really want to
[2:42:43.160 --> 2:42:47.360]  drill down on it a little bit when we get back from this message.
[2:43:43.160 --> 2:43:58.440]  It's wonderful that so many people are now thinking about preparedness and that we're
[2:43:58.440 --> 2:44:03.720]  seeing record food sales, not just here, but across the world. That's good. People need
[2:44:03.720 --> 2:44:10.280]  to be self-sufficient. The average person is living hand-to-mouth paycheck-to-paycheck
[2:44:10.280 --> 2:44:15.480]  and doesn't even know how to change their tire. We need to reverse this trend and start getting
[2:44:15.480 --> 2:44:20.120]  prepared. And that means even with just the basics, even a three-week food supply that
[2:44:20.120 --> 2:44:25.280]  you know is always there that you only go to in emergencies. That said, boosting your
[2:44:25.280 --> 2:44:30.680]  immune system is just as critical or even more so. And things like DNA Force Plus that's
[2:44:30.680 --> 2:44:36.080]  now back in stock is so good for your cells, your mitochondria, your telomeres, the engine
[2:44:36.080 --> 2:44:42.640]  of your body. It's back in stock 40% off right now along with ultra-twelve and along with
[2:44:42.640 --> 2:44:45.760]  vitamin and mineral fusion and a bunch of other great products that are finally back

[2:44:55.120 --> 2:45:01.920]  A lot of people ask me the Info War secret and I'll just tell you, I'm just real. Now
[2:45:01.920 --> 2:45:06.760]  the problem is I go back and forth though in my mind about where I stand. I mean on
[2:45:06.760 --> 2:45:11.760]  basic stuff like the Second Amendment and family and God, I'm 100%. But you get to other
[2:45:11.760 --> 2:45:16.760]  issues, I start asking myself questions. So I'll just tell you, I feel really guilty during
[2:45:16.760 --> 2:45:21.400]  the middle of this crisis selling high-quality, swareable food. Even though it's pre-positioned,
[2:45:21.400 --> 2:45:25.640]  I'm right. We're right about being man-made. We're right about it being super deadly. We're
[2:45:25.640 --> 2:45:30.960]  right about being prepared. It still feels weird to be right. Isn't that crazy? But you
[2:45:30.960 --> 2:45:35.400]  know what? I'm getting past that. We still have swareable food. We have plenty of it.
[2:45:35.400 --> 2:45:39.440]  The problem is the packaging of it and getting it out. Other competitors don't have it. They're
[2:45:39.440 --> 2:45:44.720]  lying to you. Get your orders at infowarstore.com and you know you're going to get high-quality
[2:45:44.720 --> 2:45:48.800]  swareable food. But now it's not two weeks. It's four weeks, folks. We got the food. We
[2:45:48.800 --> 2:45:54.880]  got to package it. Get your food today, high quality and fund the Info War at infowarstore.com.
[2:45:54.880 --> 2:45:59.960]  There's roughly only 260 days left until the 2020 election and already you've seen all
[2:45:59.960 --> 2:46:03.240]  sorts of crazy things happen. The globalists are trying to plunge the economy. They're
[2:46:03.240 --> 2:46:07.400]  trying to start wars. They're trying to overthrow the president. They're trying to silence free
[2:46:07.400 --> 2:46:11.680]  speech. They're trying to trigger riots in the streets, but everything they do is blowing
[2:46:11.680 --> 2:46:16.360]  up in their face. We the people have to pray, stay focused, be involved, keep spreading the
[2:46:16.360 --> 2:46:21.960]  word, keep countering their lies, and we have to be prepared in case things go south. That's
[2:46:21.960 --> 2:46:26.840]  why it's so critical to go to infowarstore.com and stock up on high-quality preparedness
[2:46:26.840 --> 2:46:31.640]  items from storeable foods, high-quality water filtration, air filtration to the very best

[2:46:58.520 --> 2:47:02.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:47:02.240 --> 2:47:18.200]  Well, I want to give John, John, I want to give you a chance to finish the point that
[2:47:18.200 --> 2:47:24.840]  you were making when we were at the break, because I think it was a critical one.
[2:47:24.840 --> 2:47:30.240]  Yes. Thank you, Dr. Keyes, and it's great to be with you. Again, the president was at
[2:47:30.240 --> 2:47:34.600]  a live briefing and a reporter figured he would sandbag the president. He said, sir,
[2:47:34.600 --> 2:47:38.880]  the Constitution states the punishment for treason is execution. Would you name your
[2:47:38.880 --> 2:47:43.800]  adversaries? And Trump went on to name them, Comey, Stroke, Page, Backe. That's a pretty
[2:47:43.800 --> 2:47:48.320]  big deal, and I'll take it one step further. This is where we are, and this is where we're
[2:47:48.320 --> 2:47:53.840]  heading, the rule of law reset. You know, U.S. Section Code 2384, seditious conspiracy
[2:47:53.840 --> 2:47:58.400]  in 2385, advocating the overthrow of a government. That's what we're dealing with here. And
[2:47:58.400 --> 2:48:02.800]  even Julian Assange, why understand the paperwork is being prepared. He's going to come back
[2:48:02.800 --> 2:48:06.840]  in the U.S. and we'll find his day in U.S. court. Thank goodness for that. But I'll tell
[2:48:06.840 --> 2:48:12.800]  you what, he sent a report out 200 people in the media that are complicit in violation
[2:48:12.800 --> 2:48:18.720]  of these codes. Why? Because they knowingly, falsely reported information, thus aiding
[2:48:18.720 --> 2:48:24.800]  and abetting these failed coup d'etats. So this is a pretty big deal because seditious
[2:48:24.800 --> 2:48:29.080]  conspiracy and advocating the overthrow of a government are not small issues. And lastly,
[2:48:29.080 --> 2:48:34.520]  John Kerry and Barack Obama. You want to talk about high crimes and misdemeanors? You
[2:48:34.520 --> 2:48:38.280]  want to talk about treasonous acts and violating the Logan Act? Well, you've got to look at
[2:48:38.280 --> 2:48:42.840]  the previous administration and this will all come out in the Pfizer reports now. But
[2:48:42.840 --> 2:48:48.040]  what we're talking about here is the failed, the last failed coup was to try and bring
[2:48:48.040 --> 2:48:52.880]  Trump into war. But that backfired because of the intel we had and we beat them to the
[2:48:52.880 --> 2:49:01.640]  punch. And now we got the coronavirus. Sure. Let me ask a question because I think these
[2:49:01.640 --> 2:49:10.960]  are very serious charges. A very serious subject. And it's a subject that goes beyond politics
[2:49:10.960 --> 2:49:16.840]  and it goes beyond individual wrongdoing because it has something to do with the culture of
[2:49:16.840 --> 2:49:20.800]  our self-government. One of the things I've liked about being American and you notice
[2:49:20.800 --> 2:49:28.640]  that they're very careful in the Constitution. When they talk about impeachment and removal,
[2:49:28.640 --> 2:49:33.720]  for instance, the penalties that are specified are penalties that have to do with being removed
[2:49:33.720 --> 2:49:38.560]  from office and having trust withdrawn from you by the American people. They haven't been
[2:49:38.560 --> 2:49:42.960]  applying that one, but I think they really ought to because once you've been in a breach
[2:49:42.960 --> 2:49:47.520]  of trust, it's a serious problem. But don't you think that when we're dealing with the
[2:49:47.520 --> 2:49:51.560]  issue of treason and the death penalty, what I don't want to see happen here, I'll be frank
[2:49:51.560 --> 2:49:57.680]  with you, John. And it's why the word purge, I don't like it. It's all associated with
[2:49:57.680 --> 2:50:05.440]  the communist system in which disputes quickly become a subject of show trials in which you're
[2:50:05.440 --> 2:50:11.600]  going to be put to death. That's the French Revolution. It's not the American Revolution.
[2:50:11.600 --> 2:50:16.320]  That's the Russian Revolution. It's not the American Revolution. One of the things that
[2:50:16.320 --> 2:50:22.920]  I think has been an advantage for our politics is that we've been very careful to make sure
[2:50:22.920 --> 2:50:28.720]  that the political competition doesn't become a matter of life and death because once it
[2:50:28.720 --> 2:50:35.160]  does, holding on to power becomes an imperative that people not only can't resist, they think
[2:50:35.160 --> 2:50:39.640]  their lives depend on it. Do you think it would be a little careless of us to be rushing
[2:50:39.640 --> 2:50:43.480]  into that kind of a political culture? Because I do.
[2:50:43.480 --> 2:50:48.600]  Well, I agree with your points and my comments are we're not rushing. That's what everyone
[2:50:48.600 --> 2:50:53.960]  wanted us to do. Why didn't you lock her up yet? Well, timing is everything. And just
[2:50:53.960 --> 2:50:58.640]  because the Constitution states the punishment for treasonous execution doesn't necessarily
[2:50:58.640 --> 2:51:04.840]  mean it will be carried out if one is guilty of that. But at least they will pay some price.
[2:51:04.840 --> 2:51:08.000]  And so your point is well taken and I completely agree.
[2:51:08.000 --> 2:51:13.400]  Because I think that would be a reasonable response to these guys because I always keep
[2:51:13.400 --> 2:51:19.640]  in mind two things. When they start poking and prodding on issues like this, it partly
[2:51:19.640 --> 2:51:25.240]  has to do with Donald Trump, but also partly has to do with what they are planning to do.
[2:51:25.240 --> 2:51:29.960]  When they talk socialism and communism, when Bernie Sanders shows all this admiration for
[2:51:29.960 --> 2:51:35.880]  Joseph Stalin stuff, you know, part of what warns me against socialists. It's why I absolutely,
[2:51:35.880 --> 2:51:42.840]  you'd really have to convince me before I go with anybody who subscribes to that ideology
[2:51:42.840 --> 2:51:50.080]  because it has always been an ideology of death and mass murder. Everywhere it gets total
[2:51:50.080 --> 2:51:57.600]  control. It's a life or death issue politics. And if it gets into their hands that power,
[2:51:57.600 --> 2:52:04.800]  it's French Revolution off with their heads, streets running red with blood, people dying
[2:52:04.800 --> 2:52:10.720]  because they didn't tow the party line. I never want to see that culture in this country.
[2:52:10.720 --> 2:52:16.400]  And if we're getting to the point where our political competition becomes a matter of
[2:52:16.400 --> 2:52:21.600]  if you lose, you die, then I think we're going to be in serious trouble as a people and we
[2:52:21.600 --> 2:52:27.280]  should do everything as a self conscious effort on the part of this people. Because at the
[2:52:27.280 --> 2:52:33.320]  end of the day, it's not a matter of these people fighting on their little elitist level
[2:52:33.320 --> 2:52:38.080]  to wipe each other out so they can get total control. We can't let it happen. Otherwise,
[2:52:38.080 --> 2:52:44.000]  the American people will no longer be in control. And that's a question, see, because I think
[2:52:44.000 --> 2:52:48.080]  that right now, if you were to ask me, Alan, do you think that the American people are
[2:52:48.080 --> 2:52:51.800]  still in control of this country? I think that's what's hanging in the balance. That's
[2:52:51.800 --> 2:52:56.040]  why Nancy Pelosi doesn't want our elections to matter so much and so forth and so on.
[2:52:56.040 --> 2:53:02.760]  Because she wants us to live in a system where you've got the elitist faction in control
[2:53:02.760 --> 2:53:06.960]  and the different sides of it compete with each other the way the old aristocrats used
[2:53:06.960 --> 2:53:12.320]  to. And the battlefield may be politics and the buildings are left standing, but they're
[2:53:12.320 --> 2:53:18.000]  still out to do murder. And I don't think we want to take this country down that road.
[2:53:18.000 --> 2:53:23.120]  I don't think the founders envisaged it as such. So I think every time we use the word
[2:53:23.120 --> 2:53:28.000]  treason, we ought to be speaking with the most deep seriousness that we're capable
[2:53:28.000 --> 2:53:33.360]  of. And right now, I don't see it in our leadership in this country. I don't see that kind of serious
[2:53:33.360 --> 2:53:40.120]  regard for conscience, right and wrong, and the deep issues of justice that sustain self-government,
[2:53:40.120 --> 2:53:44.760]  not their pursuit of power. Am I wrong?
[2:53:44.760 --> 2:53:48.680]  Well I think as the D-class gets underway, the things we cited before, the things that
[2:53:48.680 --> 2:53:55.800]  are in fact actually happening now, because the pendulum has shifted, we're going to see
[2:53:55.800 --> 2:54:00.240]  these things, overall, that you're talking about start to play out in a positive way.
[2:54:00.240 --> 2:54:06.960]  Which you've got, if you don't restore justice, if you don't restore the integrity of what
[2:54:06.960 --> 2:54:11.400]  the FBI is supposed to be about and the FISA warrant process supposed to be about, you're
[2:54:11.400 --> 2:54:17.400]  in serious trouble. So people do have to hang figuratively speaking. This is a big issue.
[2:54:17.400 --> 2:54:22.720]  And to the elections right now with socialism, it's a very clear, distinct thing. We are
[2:54:22.720 --> 2:54:29.520]  fighting a revolution. Trump is trying to resurrect America. This is a second revolution
[2:54:29.520 --> 2:54:35.160]  in America, and it's being fought peacefully to an extent. But we have to win this, because
[2:54:35.160 --> 2:54:38.720]  socialism and communism is where they are heading. They're not hiding. They're hidden
[2:54:38.720 --> 2:54:44.680]  in plain sight. They've decloaked. And look, as far as the candidates go, Biden is dead
[2:54:44.680 --> 2:54:48.560]  on the rival. The old guard, if you will, have used him, chewed him up and spit him
[2:54:48.560 --> 2:54:52.840]  out. He's finished. But a Buttigieg was, I believe, who they wanted, but he's not going
[2:54:52.840 --> 2:54:58.440]  to make it. Look, at the end of the day, Bernie Sanders is the only one that has a real movement.
[2:54:58.440 --> 2:55:03.160]  They don't want him in, so he isn't going to get it. In my opinion, just an opinion,
[2:55:03.160 --> 2:55:07.240]  I think you're going to seek Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama. There's a ticket that
[2:55:07.240 --> 2:55:12.760]  they're going to bring out the 11th hour. Yeah. And you know what? Bring that on, because
[2:55:12.760 --> 2:55:16.600]  Hillary Clinton will be in the middle of indictments. And I can't wait to see Trump
[2:55:16.600 --> 2:55:21.360]  on a debate stage unpack Michelle Obama's suitcase if you hear me loud and clear. Forget
[2:55:21.360 --> 2:55:27.000]  about it. No one's going to be Trump. But it's a fascinating time to be alive. And it's
[2:55:27.000 --> 2:55:32.400]  capitalism and America and freedom or tyranny. That's where we're heading, folks. It's a
[2:55:32.400 --> 2:55:35.600]  clear decision in the 2020 election, in my opinion.
[2:55:35.600 --> 2:55:36.600]  Yeah, they are.
[2:55:36.600 --> 2:55:43.480]  Don't I tell you, man, I really appreciate you. You're always optimistic. And this reminds
[2:55:43.480 --> 2:55:48.320]  me a little bit, just a little bit. Now, don't get excited of the Bible. There's prophecies
[2:55:48.320 --> 2:55:53.360]  in here. Yeah, I know. Isn't that exciting? There's prophecies in here that are now playing
[2:55:53.360 --> 2:55:58.360]  out as if you were Ezekiel or Jeremiah or something. But this is exciting. You can get
[2:55:58.360 --> 2:56:05.120]  it from Defiance Press or also johnmichaelchambers.com. And John Michael, it's always a pleasure
[2:56:05.120 --> 2:56:11.120]  to be with you and enjoy your optimism and your Q stuff. And let's hope that this all
[2:56:11.120 --> 2:56:13.840]  plays out the way you say.
[2:56:13.840 --> 2:56:18.640]  The only comparison that can be factually made between me and the Bible would be, I have
[2:56:18.640 --> 2:56:25.960]  the same initials, but that's about it. I love it. Thank you, man.
[2:56:25.960 --> 2:56:30.200]  Well, thank you, John. As always, I really appreciate it when you when you come on. And
[2:56:30.200 --> 2:56:34.680]  I hope that all of you who are watching, I know that the Info Wars audience, you all
[2:56:34.680 --> 2:56:42.000]  are very thoughtful people. You are looking to feed your own capacity to reach a judgment
[2:56:42.000 --> 2:56:48.400]  based on information rather than having information withheld from you. And I'm glad to be a little
[2:56:48.400 --> 2:56:53.360]  part today of that effort to bring it to you. But also to spark your thinking, because I
[2:56:53.360 --> 2:56:57.920]  think one of the things we're not encouraged to do anymore is remember that we're not just
[2:56:57.920 --> 2:57:03.160]  responsible for ourselves as citizens of the United States. You do realize that, right?
[2:57:03.160 --> 2:57:06.320]  They want us to think about ourselves. What are we getting? What have they done for you
[2:57:06.320 --> 2:57:10.480]  lately? How is your job going? What money are you making? How is your company doing?
[2:57:10.480 --> 2:57:15.080]  And so forth and so on. But when we participate in elections, when we make choices for the
[2:57:15.080 --> 2:57:21.520]  government of the United States, that's all about maintaining the sovereignty of the American
[2:57:21.520 --> 2:57:27.040]  people as implemented through the Constitution of the United States. We are making judgments
[2:57:27.040 --> 2:57:32.840]  that will, of course, affect our posterity and the future of the kind of liberty and
[2:57:32.840 --> 2:57:38.120]  self-government we've enjoyed. And I think that means that we have to always be thinking
[2:57:38.120 --> 2:57:47.240]  about our special responsibility for that future. I spend a lot of time reminding the
[2:57:47.240 --> 2:57:53.080]  info wars, the family of listeners and viewers that without you, we won't be on the air.
[2:57:53.080 --> 2:57:57.320]  And I spend a lot of time thanking you. But I really think you should thank yourself for
[2:57:57.320 --> 2:58:01.400]  keeping us on the air and really changing the world for the better and raising the alarm
[2:58:01.400 --> 2:58:06.520]  as modern ball reviewers. But something I should spend more time on is just reminding
[2:58:06.520 --> 2:58:11.720]  you that these products are really amazing. You've got that pledge from me, but you've
[2:58:11.720 --> 2:58:16.400]  seen the third party test out there, the air filtration, the water filtration, the supplements
[2:58:16.400 --> 2:58:21.200]  are all the very best you're going to find out there. And you can't fund an operation
[2:58:21.200 --> 2:58:27.480]  anywhere else that's fighting the globalist this hard. So it's not a burden to support
[2:58:27.480 --> 2:58:34.600]  info wars. It really is something that is good for everybody that stands for justice
[2:58:34.600 --> 2:58:39.560]  and freedom and makes your life and your family's life and your children's life so much better.

[2:58:45.400 --> 2:58:52.080]  There can no longer be any doubt. This Corona virus is serious on multiple levels. It's
[2:58:52.080 --> 2:58:57.960]  very communicable. It spreads very, very fast. It is killing a lot of people. And the Chinese
[2:58:57.960 --> 2:59:02.520]  communist government has covered up just how bad it is. And the White House is now openly
[2:59:02.520 --> 2:59:09.280]  challenging them, show our Trump's top scientist. And so is Senator Cotton. My friends, now
[2:59:09.280 --> 2:59:15.600]  is the time to get prepared. 2020 is not a year to play games with the globalist are
[2:59:15.600 --> 2:59:20.440]  trying to create economic collapse, race riots. We don't know how bad this virus is going

[2:59:47.960 --> 3:00:04.920]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. I'm on keys. This is info wars. And right now
[3:00:04.920 --> 3:00:12.160]  I want to take us into some areas that deal with what I introduced yesterday because it's
[3:00:12.160 --> 3:00:16.200]  always on my mind. And even as we're having our discussions here, you may have noticed
[3:00:16.200 --> 3:00:22.360]  I try to whenever I can bring things back so that we're not just talking about this
[3:00:22.360 --> 3:00:28.920]  issue or that issue. We are talking about the issue. And what is the issue? Even if
[3:00:28.920 --> 3:00:34.640]  you say we're at war, right? People usually go to war to defend things, at least decent
[3:00:34.640 --> 3:00:39.760]  people. You don't go to war to take stuff from folks. You don't go to war to get vengeance
[3:00:39.760 --> 3:00:44.960]  and all of these kinds of things as possible. But you don't really decent people only go
[3:00:44.960 --> 3:00:51.160]  to war in order to defend that which is most precious to their lives. Because war involves
[3:00:51.160 --> 3:00:54.480]  when you're dealing with it in the way it has been dealt with. It's starting to go out
[3:00:54.480 --> 3:00:59.840]  there to kill people. And one of the problems is we've become all together too much along
[3:00:59.840 --> 3:01:05.160]  these days about what it means to kill other people, to kill innocent folks, people who
[3:01:05.160 --> 3:01:09.920]  have done us no harm. You don't kill them, generally speaking. You don't want to kill
[3:01:09.920 --> 3:01:14.560]  them. You don't get involved in killing them and wars that are started with a view to taking
[3:01:14.560 --> 3:01:19.880]  something from somebody else by killing innocent folks. Americans have always pretty much as
[3:01:19.880 --> 3:01:25.440]  a people now reacted to such wars as wrong. That doesn't mean we haven't been engaged
[3:01:25.440 --> 3:01:31.360]  in them. But usually you can't keep the American people involved in a war once they realize,
[3:01:31.360 --> 3:01:36.800]  oh my gosh, we're doing what the bad guys do. We don't want to do this. And that means
[3:01:36.800 --> 3:01:42.600]  that something we're trying to preserve, something we're fighting for goes beyond the issues
[3:01:42.600 --> 3:01:47.240]  they usually talk to us about. It's not just about how much money is in your pocket, how
[3:01:47.240 --> 3:01:53.400]  prosperous you're going to be. I think, and I hope and pray, that it is still the case
[3:01:53.400 --> 3:01:59.200]  that if we have a choice between damaging our pocketbooks and losing our conscience,
[3:01:59.200 --> 3:02:05.040]  which is necessary to sustain our understanding of rights and everything else we hold dear
[3:02:05.040 --> 3:02:09.760]  and precious about this nation's opportunity for self-government, I still hope we're the
[3:02:09.760 --> 3:02:14.760]  sort of people who will choose conscience over convenience. But I don't know. And do
[3:02:14.760 --> 3:02:19.480]  you know why I don't know? I don't know because everything that's going on seems to militate
[3:02:19.480 --> 3:02:24.560]  against that now. And people don't see the connection sometimes, but the issues that
[3:02:24.560 --> 3:02:30.000]  we're being challenged with, particularly issues like what we're doing in terms of the
[3:02:30.000 --> 3:02:34.640]  education of our kids. What are we doing with issues of conscience that have to do with
[3:02:34.640 --> 3:02:39.280]  taking innocent life? Well, if he was a question to the abortion issue, I'll be talking about
[3:02:39.280 --> 3:02:43.240]  an issue like that when we get back and getting a little more deeply into it. There's been
[3:02:43.240 --> 3:02:49.520]  a bill before the Congress and the big debate between the senators is, is this an issue
[3:02:49.520 --> 3:02:54.520]  that involves abortion or is this an issue that involves taking life? And I'm thinking
[3:02:54.520 --> 3:02:59.960]  to myself, where did we get off making a distinction like that? What does this mean? When folks
[3:02:59.960 --> 3:03:04.560]  can actually think they're having a debate that doesn't miss the point when they make
[3:03:04.560 --> 3:03:09.360]  that contrast. And when I'm watching young people in one interview I saw recently, you
[3:03:09.360 --> 3:03:14.600]  know, who are being asked what they think about abortion and their response has all
[3:03:14.600 --> 3:03:21.240]  to do with whether or not the particular individual woman is getting what she wants, doing what
[3:03:21.240 --> 3:03:27.520]  she wants, getting her choice, no longer even a thought about whether or not a life is being
[3:03:27.520 --> 3:03:32.920]  taken that shouldn't be taken, whether there's a rubric for that that goes beyond the way
[3:03:32.920 --> 3:03:38.280]  we feel, our convenience, what's going to happen to us. And that really has to do with
[3:03:38.280 --> 3:03:44.680]  our fundamental claim to be a way of life that is based on respect for God endowed
[3:03:44.680 --> 3:03:50.880]  right. Now that word rights, I know they've, they've really fooled us. They fooled us by
[3:03:50.880 --> 3:03:55.760]  getting us to believe that that word right equals freedom. Does that word right equal
[3:03:55.760 --> 3:03:58.920]  freedom? And why don't we call it freedom all the time? Why do we call it right? Why
[3:03:58.920 --> 3:04:06.320]  does it God endowed unalienable freedom? They said right for a reason because the freedom
[3:04:06.320 --> 3:04:13.480]  is not always used rightly. So you have the power. That's what freedom essentially is.
[3:04:13.480 --> 3:04:19.600]  It's the power to do something. The real choice is the power to get something done, affect
[3:04:19.600 --> 3:04:26.600]  something in a certain way. And if you use that power wrongly, is it still a right? Do
[3:04:26.600 --> 3:04:30.960]  we ponder these questions anymore properly? I'm going to be talking about that in terms
[3:04:30.960 --> 3:04:35.320]  of specific issues right after we get back from this break. And I hope you prepare your
[3:04:35.320 --> 3:04:42.240]  mind, shake off the doldrums that we're sometimes in because I want us to think about not just
[3:04:42.240 --> 3:04:49.440]  the particular issue, but its implications for our liberty understood as righteous self-government.
[3:04:49.440 --> 3:04:53.440]  We'll be right back.

[3:06:18.120 --> 3:06:24.200]  A war for your soul. It's a war for your heart. It's a war for your soul. And the issues
[3:06:24.200 --> 3:06:30.040]  that we talk about sometimes altogether too nonchalantly and invite this kind of reflection.
[3:06:30.040 --> 3:06:34.320]  But we don't, we're not invited anymore to think of it that way. Matter of fact, I think
[3:06:34.320 --> 3:06:38.440]  they want us to stay away from all of that. And they try to get us to be all frightened
[3:06:38.440 --> 3:06:42.960]  of it. You're not religious. You can't talk about religion and politics. How can it be
[3:06:42.960 --> 3:06:50.680]  that we've become a people based on the notion country started, had a big war, looked impossible,
[3:06:50.680 --> 3:06:54.760]  but they got through it anyway, had a big war again over slavery, looked impossible,
[3:06:54.760 --> 3:07:00.680]  but they got through it anyway. And both those major wars in the history of the United States,
[3:07:00.680 --> 3:07:04.200]  Revolutionary War and Civil War, they weren't just based on a question of what's in your
[3:07:04.200 --> 3:07:08.520]  pocketbook and so forth and so on. They were based on the question of whether it's right
[3:07:08.520 --> 3:07:17.880]  or wrong to abuse other human beings as you are using the freedom that you have on account
[3:07:17.880 --> 3:07:25.480]  of your material wealth or power or position. We're always arguing about what makes this
[3:07:25.480 --> 3:07:30.120]  more wealthy and more powerful and gets us into that position and so forth and so on.
[3:07:30.120 --> 3:07:35.400]  But the argument that brought the country into existence was an argument over whether
[3:07:35.400 --> 3:07:41.240]  the use of one's freedom, not just the freedom, but is the use of your freedom in accordance
[3:07:41.240 --> 3:07:48.600]  with right. That's what the word right requires that we think about. And this occurs to me
[3:07:48.600 --> 3:07:55.840]  all the time. It occurred to me as I was reading an article recently in which debates
[3:07:55.840 --> 3:08:02.400]  going on in the Senate. And it was a debate between the people who think that if somebody
[3:08:02.400 --> 3:08:08.680]  tries to abort a child and that abortion doesn't succeed and the child comes out of
[3:08:08.680 --> 3:08:14.440]  the womb alive, that there should be a law that says you've got to treat that child as
[3:08:14.440 --> 3:08:20.240]  a life that has to be cared for. It reflects the underlying issue that's at the heart of
[3:08:20.240 --> 3:08:24.640]  abortion that nobody wants to talk about, which is the same issue that was at the heart
[3:08:24.640 --> 3:08:34.080]  of slavery. If otherwise innocent people are in your power, do you get to kill them?
[3:08:34.080 --> 3:08:37.960]  Because they're in your way. Do you get to kill them because it's more convenient for
[3:08:37.960 --> 3:08:42.800]  you? Do you get to kill them because their little existence, their continued existence
[3:08:42.800 --> 3:08:46.920]  will make you is going to get in the way of your feelings or will get in the way of your
[3:08:46.920 --> 3:08:52.400]  career and so forth. That's a simple truth. That's what we're facing. It's just like powerful
[3:08:52.400 --> 3:08:57.080]  countries used to look at other people's lands and say we get to go in and take whatever
[3:08:57.080 --> 3:09:03.240]  we like because we have the power to do it. That's how the Romans thought about everything.
[3:09:03.240 --> 3:09:09.920]  Were they right? Well, our founders, God didn't think so. And I know when I say that all of
[3:09:09.920 --> 3:09:13.440]  those folks are going to stand up and say, well, they had slaves. What do you mean they
[3:09:13.440 --> 3:09:19.760]  didn't think so? They didn't think so because just like folks today who understand somewhere
[3:09:19.760 --> 3:09:25.920]  in their minds, what's right? The problem is that in those days, the fact that they
[3:09:25.920 --> 3:09:34.320]  were doing wrong didn't lead many of them to deny what was the standard of right. They
[3:09:34.320 --> 3:09:39.760]  demanded respect for it anyway. And then they felt what? They felt guilt and they felt shame
[3:09:39.760 --> 3:09:45.120]  and they felt difficulty because they knew that they were plotting along this path. They
[3:09:45.120 --> 3:09:48.200]  couldn't see their way out of it, but they were doing wrong. Do you know what we're doing
[3:09:48.200 --> 3:09:55.760]  now? Instead of wrestling with those issues of conscience, we're basically saying, hey,
[3:09:55.760 --> 3:09:59.320]  can't decide right and wrong. It's all relative to how I feel and what power I have and so
[3:09:59.320 --> 3:10:05.760]  forth and so on. And so the only rubric is, is it good for me? You really think that's
[3:10:05.760 --> 3:10:11.840]  a standard of right to you because it's not the standard we were founded on. And I know
[3:10:11.840 --> 3:10:16.160]  that for some people, it's so unpopular to remember. But the words in the Declaration
[3:10:16.160 --> 3:10:25.520]  of Independence are endowed by their creator, all human beings endowed by their creator,
[3:10:25.520 --> 3:10:31.800]  not by their will, not by their preference, not by their convenience, not by their bodies,
[3:10:31.800 --> 3:10:38.120]  but by their creator with certain unalienable meaning you can't give them up, can't escape
[3:10:38.120 --> 3:10:45.280]  them, can't give them away. And then you ask yourself, well, is that just that's my freedom?
[3:10:45.280 --> 3:10:52.080]  Well, no, it's your freedom only if you are exercising the right. Exercising the right
[3:10:52.080 --> 3:10:57.440]  means implementing it, carrying it into practice. And so there's big debate going on. And on
[3:10:57.440 --> 3:11:03.920]  the Democrat side, for the most part, they stopped a bill recently through the cloture
[3:11:03.920 --> 3:11:10.200]  procedure because it requires a supermajority to get something back to the floor for a final
[3:11:10.200 --> 3:11:17.120]  vote. And the Democrats blocked the cloture motion, which would have shut down the debate.
[3:11:17.120 --> 3:11:22.520]  And so they stopped Republican legislation that would require doctors to provide care
[3:11:22.520 --> 3:11:29.000]  to babies who survive abortion. Now think about that. They call it babies, and at one,
[3:11:29.000 --> 3:11:37.920]  I think CNN or somebody actually or four to a fetus that is born alive, they called it.
[3:11:37.920 --> 3:11:44.080]  What is a fetus that is born alive, y'all? Well, it's us. You do remember that, right?
[3:11:44.080 --> 3:11:48.840]  You were once a fetus that was born alive. You think it would have been okay, you're
[3:11:48.840 --> 3:11:52.640]  a fetus, you're born alive, and somebody just takes a gun and shoots your brains out? You
[3:11:52.640 --> 3:11:59.600]  think that's all right? And they do it because, well, you're mine. You're my possession. You're
[3:11:59.600 --> 3:12:04.240]  my belonging, and I get to do with you what I want. I've been trying to make it clear
[3:12:04.240 --> 3:12:12.160]  to people that the kind of property that's involved in procreation is not instrumental
[3:12:12.160 --> 3:12:19.760]  property, property we get to use. It's responsibility property, property, belongings for which we
[3:12:19.760 --> 3:12:26.560]  are responsible in their care, in their upbringing, in their cultivation, whatever you want to
[3:12:26.560 --> 3:12:34.040]  call it, to God. That's what a God in doubt on alienable right is all about. And so when
[3:12:34.040 --> 3:12:41.200]  you deal with a question like this, you're getting into an issue of whether or not you're
[3:12:41.200 --> 3:12:47.240]  going to be thinking when you deal with this question about that claim of right. Now, why
[3:12:47.240 --> 3:12:52.360]  should it be so important to everybody? Because we have a unique form of government. You do
[3:12:52.360 --> 3:12:58.960]  remember, a unique form of government. Never before in the history of humankind, as a people,
[3:12:58.960 --> 3:13:05.560]  this large and extensive had the kind of responsibility for the outcomes that determine
[3:13:05.560 --> 3:13:10.040]  the fate of governments who's going to staff them, who's going to leave them, who's going
[3:13:10.040 --> 3:13:16.080]  to exercise the power in them. Never before on the scale that we've known it, and especially
[3:13:16.080 --> 3:13:21.600]  not with a population so diverse that it now represents all of humanity. There used to
[3:13:21.600 --> 3:13:25.480]  be this idea, no, you had to be this kind of person, and that kind of person before
[3:13:25.480 --> 3:13:28.960]  you could get involved in any governmental decision, and it mainly meant power, and it
[3:13:28.960 --> 3:13:35.240]  mainly meant wealth. And to us, it means that you're just a person who is endowed with the
[3:13:35.240 --> 3:13:41.720]  same sense of right, the same sense of conscience, and that you have the capacity to let that
[3:13:41.720 --> 3:13:49.680]  sense of conscience govern your behavior. That qualifies you. To be somebody who participates
[3:13:49.680 --> 3:13:55.400]  in deciding who is going to make key legislative and executive decisions in your society.
[3:13:55.400 --> 3:14:00.840]  But what if you've allowed that conscience to be destroyed? What if you've allowed yourself
[3:14:00.840 --> 3:14:05.120]  to be just turned into somebody who doesn't care about such things? How long do you think
[3:14:05.120 --> 3:14:10.080]  this way of life is going to last if we keep this up? And we look at an article like this
[3:14:10.080 --> 3:14:14.920]  and we think, that's about abortion. No, that's about self-government. That's about whether
[3:14:14.920 --> 3:14:21.440]  we're going to stick to or deny the premise that keeps powerful people from looking at
[3:14:21.440 --> 3:14:28.560]  us and saying, by the way, when you get in our way, you are no more to us than that child
[3:14:28.560 --> 3:14:35.480]  is to the mother. See? That child, his or her mother, you're no more to us than the child
[3:14:35.480 --> 3:14:42.740]  is to his or her mother. And we have now accepted the notion that human beings get to choose
[3:14:42.740 --> 3:14:48.520]  whether or not people who are so disparate in power from them that they're helpless,
[3:14:48.520 --> 3:14:54.320]  that they entirely depend on the forbearance or even the aid of others. You just get to
[3:14:54.320 --> 3:14:59.480]  slaughter them. Do you really believe that? Because that's what's really involved in these
[3:14:59.480 --> 3:15:05.040]  issues and it's more than just this issue. See, that's the kind of connection that I
[3:15:05.040 --> 3:15:10.440]  don't think we're making properly anymore. We pretend we're dealing with the issues,
[3:15:10.440 --> 3:15:15.680]  but we don't realize that in a way, all these issues are the same issue. And when I get
[3:15:15.680 --> 3:15:21.880]  back, I'll go to another issue and show you that you can trace it back to that foundation
[3:15:21.880 --> 3:15:29.200]  in just the same way. And you'll have to reach the same conclusion about what's really involved.
[3:15:29.200 --> 3:15:34.600]  And if we don't keep that in mind, then we'll keep dealing carelessly with these issues
[3:15:34.600 --> 3:15:40.880]  and wake up one day and find that we got so careless, we just threw all our claim to govern
[3:15:40.880 --> 3:15:46.640]  ourselves right out the window. We'll be right back.

[3:17:55.000 --> 3:18:01.160]  world. A lot of people that never deliver. Well, I'm here to tell you, InfoWars has delivered
[3:18:01.160 --> 3:18:08.640]  in royal flush, in a handful of ace of spades because of God, because of the audience of
[3:18:08.640 --> 3:18:14.080]  activists and because of the great team at InfoWars and we are all a team, ladies and
[3:18:14.080 --> 3:18:19.800]  gentlemen. So right now, humanity's awakening is explosive, it's powerful, it's incredible.
[3:18:19.800 --> 3:18:24.400]  But there's major obstacles coming down the road and the only way we can effectively fight
[3:18:24.400 --> 3:18:29.000]  the NWO and stay in the game like InfoWars has to tip the spear is your financial support
[3:18:29.000 --> 3:18:35.400]  and make it really easy at InfoWarsStore.com. But I am blowing through our backup money
[3:18:35.400 --> 3:18:39.600]  right now with our reporters doing triple the work they ever have because they volunteered
[3:18:39.600 --> 3:18:44.360]  to do it. And Owen and the rest of the crew will fight 18 hours a day, seven days a week
[3:18:44.360 --> 3:18:48.560]  during this election year that's so critical, but they need the financing to put them in
[3:18:48.560 --> 3:18:53.880]  the field. Go to InfoWarsStore.com and fight for your own future.
[3:18:53.880 --> 3:18:57.160]  Real stuff, man, we're talking about the real deal here and I love Trump all day long, but
[3:18:57.160 --> 3:19:00.960]  man, I tell you, he sits here and lets these big tech people keep running roughshod over
[3:19:00.960 --> 3:19:05.880]  and everybody, I mean, I've got a problem and we'll just take the Trump rallies over.
[3:19:05.880 --> 3:19:09.560]  That said, about two months ago, I came up with a plan that I haven't launched yet. We
[3:19:09.560 --> 3:19:14.880]  have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers, 20 different stickers, impeach
[3:19:14.880 --> 3:19:19.800]  the Democrats, save the Second Amendment, defend the First Amendment, InfoWars.com and
[3:19:19.800 --> 3:19:23.120]  it looks like duct tape, but it's just a regular sticker. You put it over your mouth, you go
[3:19:23.120 --> 3:19:27.000]  to a Trump rally and you instantly take over without even disrupting things. People say,
[3:19:27.000 --> 3:19:31.040]  why are you doing this? What's happening? Well, you go, well, we're being censored and
[3:19:31.040 --> 3:19:34.440]  Trump won't do anything about it. And Dr. Pachennick, let me just ask you what you think
[3:19:34.440 --> 3:19:39.800]  because I've not launched this yet. It's brilliant. You've taken the very element that they try
[3:19:39.800 --> 3:19:45.120]  to repress you with that silence and made it into a weapon. You have the loudest sound
[3:19:45.120 --> 3:19:57.080]  of all silence. And you know what's most disturbing to people? Silence. You're listening to the
[3:19:57.080 --> 3:20:18.840]  Alex Jones show. Now, I was talking in the last few minutes about the question that's
[3:20:18.840 --> 3:20:25.160]  in front of the Congress of a vote on abortion. And I know we have these parameters that we're
[3:20:25.160 --> 3:20:29.400]  supposed to use to talk about the abortion issue and they all miss the point. And I hope
[3:20:29.400 --> 3:20:36.400]  to illustrate very quickly here why they miss the point because on one side of the argument,
[3:20:36.400 --> 3:20:42.160]  you have people who pretend that the issue is just abstract. And on the other side, you
[3:20:42.160 --> 3:20:46.920]  have people who are also, I think sometimes pretending, but don't quite get all the way
[3:20:46.920 --> 3:20:54.160]  where they want to go, that they are seriously interested in making sure that we respect
[3:20:54.160 --> 3:21:02.560]  human life. And this led to a situation in which you had people who were arguing against
[3:21:02.560 --> 3:21:11.040]  this bill to make sure that fetuses who were not aborted when an abortion was attempted
[3:21:11.040 --> 3:21:16.840]  upon them and they come out of the womb as viable living babies to make sure that they're
[3:21:16.840 --> 3:21:22.600]  not being killed. And they were saying that that is the issue of infant mortality. No,
[3:21:22.600 --> 3:21:28.000]  that's not the issue of infant mortality. Infant mortality is a statistic about how
[3:21:28.000 --> 3:21:34.320]  many children who are ready to be born and are being born die and when they die and how
[3:21:34.320 --> 3:21:38.680]  soon during birth or after birth they die. All that's involved in infant mortality. That's
[3:21:38.680 --> 3:21:43.560]  a general kind of issue. That's a statistic. We're talking about individual life, yours
[3:21:43.560 --> 3:21:48.800]  and mine, just like somebody were to come up and over to put a gun to your head. And
[3:21:48.800 --> 3:21:53.120]  it's not only a question of how that makes you feel, but what is the real issue that's
[3:21:53.120 --> 3:21:58.280]  involved in deciding whether or not to pull that trigger? I think we all know that the
[3:21:58.280 --> 3:22:02.040]  real issue we generally understand is you just don't do that. You don't go around murdering
[3:22:02.040 --> 3:22:07.000]  people, especially not if they're just minding their own business and doing you no harm.
[3:22:07.000 --> 3:22:11.520]  You especially don't get to murder them, do you? What if they're helpless people? Absolutely
[3:22:11.520 --> 3:22:16.120]  in your power. You get to murder them then just because you have the power to do it.
[3:22:16.120 --> 3:22:20.720]  Now, when you're just in your common sense mode and you're thinking you would be the
[3:22:20.720 --> 3:22:26.480]  individual, you immediately say no. That's not right. But you're talking about offspring
[3:22:26.480 --> 3:22:32.280]  of humanity in the womb totally in the power of another human individual and they're proven,
[3:22:32.280 --> 3:22:37.080]  both of them to be proven individuals now by the genetic markers our science knows all
[3:22:37.080 --> 3:22:43.800]  about. But one of the Democratic senators, Derbyn, suggested that if lawmakers are interested
[3:22:43.800 --> 3:22:48.160]  in infant mortality doing something about it, they should consider that if you're an
[3:22:48.160 --> 3:22:53.480]  African-American infant born in America today, you are three times more likely to die in
[3:22:53.480 --> 3:22:57.640]  the first year of birth. But the question isn't about that. The question in front of
[3:22:57.640 --> 3:23:01.880]  them wasn't about that. The question in front of them was whether or not you're encouraging
[3:23:01.880 --> 3:23:06.200]  the mother to kill the child or to think that she has the right to kill the child or to think
[3:23:06.200 --> 3:23:11.880]  that the course of action that's the only way to escape is to kill the child. That's
[3:23:11.880 --> 3:23:16.120]  not an issue of infant mortality. That's an issue of conscience, whether you like it
[3:23:16.120 --> 3:23:21.560]  or not, whether you want to admit it or not. And it's also an issue that goes to the heart
[3:23:21.560 --> 3:23:27.880]  of our way of life because the fundamental premise of our way of life is that every individual,
[3:23:27.880 --> 3:23:37.840]  powerless, powerful, doesn't matter, is born and before birth created equal. That means,
[3:23:37.840 --> 3:23:45.000]  among other things, every individual has an equal claim to be respected in their life.
[3:23:45.000 --> 3:23:51.960]  Is this going on here or not? And I found myself thinking about the fact that they were raising
[3:23:51.960 --> 3:23:59.680]  a race issue. Well, as I recall, there was a race issue involved in the slavery business
[3:23:59.680 --> 3:24:04.200]  and that race issue had to do with whether you could use your freedom to take away the
[3:24:04.200 --> 3:24:09.080]  freedom of other human beings. And they're always trying to pretend, oh, people were slave
[3:24:09.080 --> 3:24:12.840]  owners and therefore we shouldn't listen to them. And they have nothing to do with, okay,
[3:24:12.840 --> 3:24:16.760]  they were slave owners and they owned slaves. I'm owned by ancestors and so forth. I'm
[3:24:16.760 --> 3:24:21.840]  going to hate on them, but I found that was pretty fruitless. But leave that aside. What
[3:24:21.840 --> 3:24:27.200]  I do, though, is I think about the real situation that we're faced with here. So we're talking
[3:24:27.200 --> 3:24:35.800]  about people then who owned slaves and enslaved them and kept them in bondage, but where the
[3:24:35.800 --> 3:24:42.960]  Constitution regarded those slaves, those enslaved black people as persons within the
[3:24:42.960 --> 3:24:49.080]  meaning of the Constitution's word, persons, and then they had to agonize over the fact
[3:24:49.080 --> 3:24:54.120]  that, wait a minute, if we regard them as persons, that means that according to our
[3:24:54.120 --> 3:24:57.840]  understanding of the declaration, we don't have the right to own these slaves. And you
[3:24:57.840 --> 3:25:02.280]  can read them as they're agonizing, the guys with these and kinds, agonizing over this
[3:25:02.280 --> 3:25:09.760]  fact, right? Today, we have people who don't seem to understand that the very same question
[3:25:09.760 --> 3:25:15.960]  is involved in killing children in the womb. And they're pretending that, oh, we care so
[3:25:15.960 --> 3:25:20.400]  much about human life and yes, I do. But I think that if the child gets in the way, that's
[3:25:20.400 --> 3:25:26.120]  the mother and you could get to kill it. No, they are endowed by their Creator. That is,
[3:25:26.120 --> 3:25:34.560]  as created, you must respect that life. And that means from the moment of conception, we
[3:25:34.560 --> 3:25:37.840]  used to have a big debate because they wanted the material proof. If you're not a walking
[3:25:37.840 --> 3:25:43.160]  around human being, I don't have to respect you. Turns out that that's not true, that
[3:25:43.160 --> 3:25:49.720]  our science can now see who's human, who's not. They can see the individual human being.
[3:25:49.720 --> 3:25:54.000]  They can see that that is an individual from the moment of conception. They can see the
[3:25:54.000 --> 3:25:57.880]  relationship with the mother and the whole thing. Can't deny it anymore. You're killing
[3:25:57.880 --> 3:26:06.360]  people. You're killing persons. And the very same people who want to make a big noise about
[3:26:06.360 --> 3:26:12.560]  how bad the slave owners were for enslaving people are not thinking about how bad they
[3:26:12.560 --> 3:26:18.760]  are for killing them. And they'll make all kinds of excuses about it and say, they haven't
[3:26:18.760 --> 3:26:22.280]  reached this point. They haven't reached that point. Don't they see that? When I hear these
[3:26:22.280 --> 3:26:26.440]  arguments about how well it's a trimester and it hasn't reached this stage of development,
[3:26:26.440 --> 3:26:32.840]  that stage, you do know that that echoes the very same arguments that were made by John
[3:26:32.840 --> 3:26:38.920]  C. Calhoun and the other died in the wool. I'm dead set on exercising my freedom to enslave
[3:26:38.920 --> 3:26:44.560]  people. That's the argument they made, saying that it was the development, developmental
[3:26:44.560 --> 3:26:48.960]  argument. These people are not the right stage of development. They don't have this attribute
[3:26:48.960 --> 3:26:55.240]  or that attribute that we regard as worthy and etc. You really want that applied to you.
[3:26:55.240 --> 3:27:02.040]  Do you think our way of life survives once we have reintroduced the notion that absolutely
[3:27:02.040 --> 3:27:08.800]  conflicts with the idea that we're all created equal and says, instead, we must gauge whether
[3:27:08.800 --> 3:27:16.320]  or not I can treat you as a person based on whether you satisfy the following 25 criteria
[3:27:16.320 --> 3:27:22.840]  of humanity that I've invented for my convenience. You do know that's where we are, right? And
[3:27:22.840 --> 3:27:28.120]  if you think that just endangers the babes in the womb, those of you who are a little
[3:27:28.120 --> 3:27:33.840]  up there in years, getting closer to that point where I'm at the moment, I have to now
[3:27:33.840 --> 3:27:40.200]  begin to suspect that I'm getting old. I'll be one of those elderly people soon, right?
[3:27:40.200 --> 3:27:44.840]  Some people would say I am already. I don't know. And at that point, there are people
[3:27:44.840 --> 3:27:49.800]  who say, well, I'm just a useless eater. That's what the Nazis call them. I shouldn't be left
[3:27:49.800 --> 3:27:53.200]  around because I'm just going to be a drain and all those people out there are more productive
[3:27:53.200 --> 3:27:59.560]  than I am. They get to live and you get to die. So it's your choice. You want to die
[3:27:59.560 --> 3:28:06.720]  this way or that way, right? Do they really have that right? You realize we've already
[3:28:06.720 --> 3:28:12.400]  answered that question if we go on killing babies in the womb because then it's just
[3:28:12.400 --> 3:28:17.520]  a matter of power. I've got power over you. You're in my power and therefore I get to
[3:28:17.520 --> 3:28:23.560]  kill you. And government has that kind of power. That's what we're thinking. It's not
[3:28:23.560 --> 3:28:28.080]  supposed to under our system. And when are we going to wake up and realize when we're
[3:28:28.080 --> 3:28:34.640]  dealing with these issues? Every time we think about, we must go to this fundamental question
[3:28:34.640 --> 3:28:53.200]  and ask whether the answer will keep us free or make us slaves. We can all agree. These
[3:28:53.200 --> 3:28:58.360]  are troubled times, right? So do you know who's on your wireless network? Whether it's

[3:33:14.880 --> 3:33:29.600]  Now it would be easy for me to say that in the last segment I was talking about the controversy
[3:33:29.600 --> 3:33:35.400]  we have in this country over abortion, right? Made a little allusion to the controversy
[3:33:35.400 --> 3:33:41.160]  that was once there about slavery. And the fact that now they have tried to turn the
[3:33:41.160 --> 3:33:48.360]  issue of slavery into the issue of racism. But is that right? That's a way of distracting
[3:33:48.360 --> 3:33:55.920]  everybody from truth. Because the issue at the heart of slavery wasn't about the color
[3:33:55.920 --> 3:34:03.440]  of the skin of the person being enslaved. Because though people like to forget it, the
[3:34:03.440 --> 3:34:10.120]  very word slave should remind you that the issue involved in slavery has nothing to
[3:34:10.120 --> 3:34:17.840]  do with skin color. Why, Alan? Because as I read the etymological dictionary, that word
[3:34:17.840 --> 3:34:22.880]  slave was actually a function of the fact that in the part of the Mediterranean world
[3:34:22.880 --> 3:34:32.280]  when the Islamic empires were all ruling that basin pretty much in various parts of it,
[3:34:32.280 --> 3:34:36.880]  they used to highly value on the slave markets in the Islamic world, guess who they highly
[3:34:36.880 --> 3:34:46.240]  value. Blonde, white skin, slobs were valued as slaves. Slavery wasn't about skin color
[3:34:46.240 --> 3:34:53.920]  then. It was about the fact that they thought these folks made wonderful slaves. And the
[3:34:53.920 --> 3:34:58.920]  slavery wasn't raised to do that. It was about thinking that because you had the power and
[3:34:58.920 --> 3:35:03.480]  conquered people or defeated them and this or that battle or stole them away and this
[3:35:03.480 --> 3:35:09.200]  or that way you got to make them slaves. And you would just exercise that power and nobody
[3:35:09.200 --> 3:35:15.480]  got in your way and you could do it. That's the issue at the heart of it. It's not race.
[3:35:15.480 --> 3:35:19.600]  So when they try to turn it into an issue of racism, I'm sitting there questioning
[3:35:19.600 --> 3:35:24.920]  that. It's not about race. It's about unless you're talking about human race. I often try
[3:35:24.920 --> 3:35:31.320]  to get people to see that when it comes to these questions and when it comes to the challenge
[3:35:31.320 --> 3:35:36.880]  facing us as a people in the United States, the question is it black racism, this racism,
[3:35:36.880 --> 3:35:45.160]  color racism? No, human race. It's anti-human racism. And right now, that's the racism that's
[3:35:45.160 --> 3:35:52.960]  taking over the place. People who are disregarding the claims of our common humanity and wanting
[3:35:52.960 --> 3:35:58.600]  to act as if the mere fact that I'm dealing with a human being doesn't mean that there's
[3:35:58.600 --> 3:36:05.880]  anything there to respect anymore unless it serves my purpose, unless it can be instrumental
[3:36:05.880 --> 3:36:12.600]  to something that has to do with my welfare, my prosperity, my gain, my ambition, my happiness.
[3:36:12.600 --> 3:36:17.080]  Then I have to respect you otherwise get out of the way. And if you don't get out, I get
[3:36:17.080 --> 3:36:24.360]  to kill you and push you over the cliff so that you won't be around to be in my way anymore.
[3:36:24.360 --> 3:36:30.600]  And you know, that's going to take us right back to the oldest possible way of doing things.
[3:36:30.600 --> 3:36:34.200]  A way that most of us, you just put it in front of us, that's wicked. That shouldn't
[3:36:34.200 --> 3:36:39.640]  be happening. Why are those people getting brutalized this way when they're human beings?
[3:36:39.640 --> 3:36:45.200]  People shouldn't do that. And yet I see these young people now and they're talking about
[3:36:45.200 --> 3:36:51.960]  issues of life and death and it's all the pretend world of I get to choose. And if in
[3:36:51.960 --> 3:36:59.520]  the end I'm choosing this callous disregard for all the information and personhood, everything,
[3:36:59.520 --> 3:37:04.480]  that doesn't matter because that's my way. I get to do it my way. That's freedom. See?
[3:37:04.480 --> 3:37:09.000]  Yeah, but the word in the declaration isn't freedom. It's actually liberty and it's defined
[3:37:09.000 --> 3:37:16.920]  as an unalienable right. An unalienable right is based on what we would today call the encoded
[3:37:16.920 --> 3:37:28.280]  inclination to do what's right in a way that then not only preserves this individual, but
[3:37:28.280 --> 3:37:33.640]  our physical flesh is programmed to actually take care of humanity as a whole. Procreation
[3:37:33.640 --> 3:37:39.920]  is about the preservation of the whole human race. Somewhere in there, there's a thought
[3:37:39.920 --> 3:37:46.480]  that sees the existence of the whole community. And that really sees it as well when you think
[3:37:46.480 --> 3:37:51.520]  about eating and drinking and the necessary relationship with stuff that's around us.
[3:37:51.520 --> 3:37:56.720]  Think about how you follow through on that in a way that respects our relationship to
[3:37:56.720 --> 3:38:01.240]  all the stuff that's out there in the universe. Kind of reminds me of that biblical phrase
[3:38:01.240 --> 3:38:07.520]  about that all things work together for good for those who love the Lord. And then Christ
[3:38:07.520 --> 3:38:13.600]  defines love as obedience. So if you are walking in the way of that law of nature, then you're
[3:38:13.600 --> 3:38:20.440]  doing what will help you to survive even as it depends on a world that has been put together
[3:38:20.440 --> 3:38:25.040]  in such a way that you can survive in it. And that it can survive you, by the way, contrary
[3:38:25.040 --> 3:38:31.400]  to the whole, we're going to destroy the universe pretense of some of the people talking about
[3:38:31.400 --> 3:38:38.800]  climate change. But it's not only that issue. So another headline that was about a Governor
[3:38:38.800 --> 3:38:46.600]  Grisham in New Mexico. And they've just passed a law there. And that law essentially amounts
[3:38:46.600 --> 3:38:54.120]  to allowing officers, state officers to come in and confiscate guns under court order and
[3:38:54.120 --> 3:39:00.280]  so forth. It's not right. There is that little thing in the Constitution about how the right
[3:39:00.280 --> 3:39:08.000]  to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. To keep means to hold on to. Right? And so
[3:39:08.000 --> 3:39:10.800]  they're saying, no, you don't get to hold on to that gun. If we tell you to give it up,
[3:39:10.800 --> 3:39:14.200]  you're going to give it up to us and all the sheriffs, whatever you may think you have
[3:39:14.200 --> 3:39:16.880]  to give it up. And the sheriffs are probably sitting there thinking, wait a minute, I can
[3:39:16.880 --> 3:39:21.480]  read the Constitution as well as you. And it says right here that I don't get to do
[3:39:21.480 --> 3:39:26.880]  that. Says that the right to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged. Right? That means
[3:39:26.880 --> 3:39:32.840]  shall not be cut back on so that it doesn't exist anymore so that it's constrained in the
[3:39:32.840 --> 3:39:36.240]  way that you're trying to constrain it. So people can't even have guns in their home.
[3:39:36.240 --> 3:39:40.440]  I'll go in there and take them out. Anybody who has a gun, I just get to take it because
[3:39:40.440 --> 3:39:46.120]  some court has ordered it. Well, has that court acted constitutionally or unconstitutionally?
[3:39:46.120 --> 3:39:50.440]  And you all say, well, the court gets to decide that. Well, no, it doesn't actually. That's
[3:39:50.440 --> 3:39:54.320]  why the revolution occurred, you see, because the court, in this case, it was the court
[3:39:54.320 --> 3:40:05.400]  of King George who was in charge of the colonies. And that court decided that they could abridge
[3:40:05.400 --> 3:40:08.920]  the rights of the American people. And they said, no, and that's how come the whole thing
[3:40:08.920 --> 3:40:14.280]  started. The whole country was based on a revolution made against that notion. And it's what I
[3:40:14.280 --> 3:40:19.400]  tried to remind folks of. We have an individual responsibility to respect these things. And
[3:40:19.400 --> 3:40:27.080]  ultimately, this whole Second Amendment thing, what is it really about? It's about two things.
[3:40:27.080 --> 3:40:34.360]  It is about how necessary it can be to have the means you need to use if someone's threatening
[3:40:34.360 --> 3:40:41.040]  your life to stop them from taking it. That's part of the reason. It was also involved in
[3:40:41.040 --> 3:40:46.000]  those days with hunting and doing other stuff you needed to procure food for yourself. So
[3:40:46.000 --> 3:40:50.400]  that sense of self-preservation wasn't just in the moment you were threatened. It was
[3:40:50.400 --> 3:40:56.760]  also in the pursuit of what was necessary to keep you alive, right? Is it necessary
[3:40:56.760 --> 3:41:04.920]  to keep you alive as the person you are for you to stand up and defend your liberty as
[3:41:04.920 --> 3:41:11.280]  an individual citizen of the United States of America, which liberty depends on regard
[3:41:11.280 --> 3:41:17.400]  for the declaration premise of God endowed unalienable rights and on the respect demanded
[3:41:17.400 --> 3:41:24.520]  for that premise in the Constitution of the United States? If they disregard that God endowed
[3:41:24.520 --> 3:41:32.160]  unalienable right to which all human persons are entitled, are they still treating you
[3:41:32.160 --> 3:41:40.560]  as a person or are they batting aside that fact in order to pursue their own aims or
[3:41:40.560 --> 3:41:49.080]  aims? And is that in accordance with respect for your person? Because if it isn't, that
[3:41:49.080 --> 3:41:56.520]  God endowed unalienable right to represent the nature the Creator has given you, because
[3:41:56.520 --> 3:42:02.240]  the word persona was the mask that actors used on the Roman or Greek stage to represent
[3:42:02.240 --> 3:42:07.400]  a character, and what character do we represent in our nature? We represent the character
[3:42:07.400 --> 3:42:15.160]  of God. That's what the script is very clear about that, but it's also there in the logic
[3:42:15.160 --> 3:42:21.080]  that underlies our claim to rights, which the U.S. Constitution was codifying. That's
[3:42:21.080 --> 3:42:27.800]  all. It didn't create the right, just codifying. See that connection? Suddenly, this disrespect
[3:42:27.800 --> 3:42:33.800]  for persons is right here in the Second Amendment issue as well. Did you think of that? Ponder
[3:42:33.800 --> 3:42:34.800]  that. We'll be right back.
[3:42:34.800 --> 3:42:56.000]  It's wonderful that so many people are now thinking about preparedness and that we're
[3:42:56.000 --> 3:43:01.240]  seeing record food sales not just here but across the world. That's good. People need
[3:43:01.240 --> 3:43:07.840]  to be self-sufficient. The average person is living hand-to-mouth paycheck-to-paycheck
[3:43:07.840 --> 3:43:12.560]  and doesn't even know how to change their tire. We need to reverse this trend and start
[3:43:12.560 --> 3:43:17.520]  getting prepared, and that means even with just the basics, even a three-week food supply
[3:43:17.520 --> 3:43:22.640]  that you know is always there that you only go to in emergencies. That said, boosting
[3:43:22.640 --> 3:43:28.000]  your immune system is just as critical or even more so. And things like DNA Force Plus
[3:43:28.000 --> 3:43:33.080]  that's now back in stock is so good for your cells, your mitochondria, your telomeres,
[3:43:33.080 --> 3:43:39.880]  the engine of your body. It's back in stock 40% off right now, along with Ultra-12 and
[3:43:39.880 --> 3:43:43.280]  along with Vito-Elemental Fusion and a bunch of other great products that are finally back
[3:43:43.280 --> 3:43:48.880]  in stock. Get yours at infowarstore.com today and support the Info War while living a healthy
[3:43:48.880 --> 3:43:51.080]  and better life. A total 360 win.
[3:43:51.080 --> 3:43:57.040]  All right, folks. Here's the bad news. We've already sold out of the 16-ounce immune gargle
[3:43:57.040 --> 3:44:01.520]  with the patented nanotech silver that's documented to knock out viruses and bacteria
[3:44:01.520 --> 3:44:06.240]  unlike anything else. But we do still have it in the three-ounce and the one-ounce for
[3:44:06.240 --> 3:44:12.320]  limited time. The good news is we have the super blue toothpaste and the super silver
[3:44:12.320 --> 3:44:17.440]  toothpaste, both that have the nano-silver in them as well. The super blue has tea tree
[3:44:17.440 --> 3:44:22.240]  that's also antiviral and antibacterial and high-quality iodine. And then, of course,
[3:44:22.240 --> 3:44:26.840]  the whitening has the nano-silver, but on top of that, it has the above-secral calcium
[3:44:26.840 --> 3:44:31.600]  that remelanorizes the teeth. And so it's just the best toothpaste you're going to find.
[3:44:31.600 --> 3:44:35.840]  Period. It has the nano-silver and we still have supplies of it, though it'll sell out
[3:44:35.840 --> 3:44:41.560]  at current rates in about two weeks. But despite that, I'm keeping it at sale at 50% off so
[3:44:41.560 --> 3:44:45.040]  everybody can protect themselves with this high-quality product. You've never used it
[3:44:45.040 --> 3:44:48.480]  before. Get yours today. Infowarstore.com.
[3:44:48.480 --> 3:44:53.680]  Infowarstore.com.
[3:44:53.680 --> 3:44:56.960]  Real stuff, man. We're talking about the real deal here. And I love Trump all day long,
[3:44:56.960 --> 3:45:00.640]  but, man, I tell you, he sits here and lets these big tech people keep running rough shot
[3:45:00.640 --> 3:45:05.720]  over him, everybody. I mean, I've got a problem. And we'll just take the Trump rallies over.
[3:45:05.720 --> 3:45:09.400]  That said, about two months ago, I came up with a plan that I haven't launched yet. We
[3:45:09.400 --> 3:45:14.760]  have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers, 20 different stickers. You impeach
[3:45:14.760 --> 3:45:18.960]  the Democrats, save the Second Amendment, defend the First Amendment, infowarstore.com.
[3:45:18.960 --> 3:45:22.800]  And it looks like duct tape, but it's just a regular sticker. You put it over your mouth,
[3:45:22.800 --> 3:45:26.480]  you go to a Trump rally, and you instantly take over without even disrupting things.
[3:45:26.480 --> 3:45:29.600]  People say, why are you doing this? What's happening? Well, you go, well, we're being
[3:45:29.600 --> 3:45:33.480]  censored. You know, Trump won't do anything about it. And Dr. Pachennick, let me just
[3:45:33.480 --> 3:45:35.680]  ask you what you think, because I've not launched this yet.
[3:45:35.680 --> 3:45:41.920]  It's brilliant. You've taken the very element that they try to repress you with, that silence,
[3:45:41.920 --> 3:45:47.160]  and made it into a weapon. You have the loudest sound of all, silence. And you know what's
[3:45:47.160 --> 3:45:52.200]  most disturbing to people? Silence, silence, silence.
[3:45:52.200 --> 3:45:56.920]  There's a lot of things I can say about the high quality, storeable food we sell at infowarstore.com.
[3:45:56.920 --> 3:46:00.840]  But everybody knows any product I sell is going to be high quality at a great price,
[3:46:00.840 --> 3:46:06.200]  because I treat you like I want to be treated. It is my religion, the golden rule. But the
[3:46:06.200 --> 3:46:12.520]  bad news is our main sponsor that does a great job, my patriot, is now three to four weeks
[3:46:12.520 --> 3:46:16.360]  out before they ship food. They have the food, but they've got to package it. And any day
[3:46:16.360 --> 3:46:20.560]  now they may come and tell me, oh, sorry, we're not selling food anymore, because they're
[3:46:20.560 --> 3:46:24.920]  not going to take orders for food they don't have. Now, you get your order in now, you
[3:46:24.920 --> 3:46:30.080]  get the high quality food. It's a smart move. It funds the M4. You can't lose. Take action
[3:46:30.080 --> 3:46:33.760]  at infowarstore.com. Whether it's three weeks, four weeks, five weeks, six weeks, a three
[3:46:33.760 --> 3:46:38.520]  month, a six month a year, special diets, they've got it all at infowarstore.com. They're
[3:46:38.520 --> 3:46:42.640]  in our back end. We're partnered with them. They'll ship it out to you the day it's packaged.
[3:46:42.640 --> 3:46:46.960]  They've got the food, but they are days and days behind shipping it out. So get your order
[3:46:46.960 --> 3:46:56.400]  in now to lock it in and it funds the M4 361 at fourstore.com. You're listening to the
[3:46:56.400 --> 3:47:11.320]  Alex Jones show.
[3:47:11.320 --> 3:47:19.280]  I don't want to miss the opportunity to say once again how wonderful it is to be sharing
[3:47:19.280 --> 3:47:25.760]  these ideas with you in the context of info war because I think that information takes
[3:47:25.760 --> 3:47:29.880]  all kinds of forms. These days we think of it as discrete little tidbits talking about
[3:47:29.880 --> 3:47:36.160]  this issue, that issue, this fact, that fact. Our preoccupation with material, physical,
[3:47:36.160 --> 3:47:43.680]  and empirical science sometimes takes our understanding of information and corrupts it so that we
[3:47:43.680 --> 3:47:50.720]  think that information is just about, quote, facts, unquote. But in terms of dealing with
[3:47:50.720 --> 3:47:55.680]  other human beings, have you noticed that human beings are not just facts? I mean their
[3:47:55.680 --> 3:48:00.200]  existence is a fact. The things they do or acts they take are a fact and so forth and
[3:48:00.200 --> 3:48:05.160]  so on. But each human being you meet is not just a fact. That human being is in a way
[3:48:05.160 --> 3:48:12.560]  of meaning, right? And in the context of our shared way of life, we still share it even
[3:48:12.560 --> 3:48:17.480]  though some people seem to be quietly trying to get us to destroy it, but we still share
[3:48:17.480 --> 3:48:22.720]  it when we pretend to. And that shared way of life is based on certain ideas. And one
[3:48:22.720 --> 3:48:30.200]  of those ideas has at the root of it, respect for other people. Not respect according to
[3:48:30.200 --> 3:48:35.040]  the standard of my will. Not even when it's a majority will. That was one of the things
[3:48:35.040 --> 3:48:40.360]  they agonized over with the Constitution, making sure that it wasn't just a majority
[3:48:40.360 --> 3:48:44.280]  will. And I'm really grateful for that. A lot of people think, well, nothing to be
[3:48:44.280 --> 3:48:51.440]  heard about slave owners. Don't be grateful to them. Why not? By remembering the standard,
[3:48:51.440 --> 3:48:57.960]  they gave people something to appeal to against the evil. If they had forgotten the standard,
[3:48:57.960 --> 3:49:02.200]  if they had torn it away, torn it out of the heart, torn it out of the minds, then there
[3:49:02.200 --> 3:49:09.240]  would have been no appeal but to arms. And the appeal but to arms, that involves persuading
[3:49:09.240 --> 3:49:14.560]  the people who already have the power to change their minds, I guess, without any argument
[3:49:14.560 --> 3:49:20.280]  that persuasively convinces them to do so. Or you wait until you get enough power and
[3:49:20.280 --> 3:49:23.760]  then you kill them and stuff, and then we can have blood baths and all this kind of
[3:49:23.760 --> 3:49:29.040]  stuff. Aren't you glad that didn't work quite that way here? We had our wars and we had
[3:49:29.040 --> 3:49:33.280]  our conflicts and we had our difficulties with people killing each other. But what made
[3:49:33.280 --> 3:49:39.040]  this country what it is was the ability to resolve those things on the basis of a shared
[3:49:39.040 --> 3:49:45.760]  understanding that allowed us to talk each other into doing what's right. And that's
[3:49:45.760 --> 3:49:51.400]  what I've been talking about here. And how do you do that? Well, there are certain prerequisites.
[3:49:51.400 --> 3:49:55.480]  You've got to be able to understand what's going on. And that's why I'm sure I'm about
[3:49:55.480 --> 3:50:00.520]  to say something that's going to shock you. I'm not sure that Bernie Sanders is exactly
[3:50:00.520 --> 3:50:05.960]  wrong to talk about how important it is that people should be educated. When he talks about
[3:50:05.960 --> 3:50:10.040]  praising, they talk about beating him up because he praised Castro for having a good
[3:50:10.040 --> 3:50:15.920]  literacy program and China for taking people out of poverty and so forth and so on. And
[3:50:15.920 --> 3:50:21.520]  I think that's part of the story. But the interesting thing that I always think of when
[3:50:21.520 --> 3:50:27.520]  people start talking that way is I think back over why it is that I still find the whole
[3:50:27.520 --> 3:50:35.320]  memory of my ancestors in slavery repugnant. It still makes me feel somewhere inside me
[3:50:35.320 --> 3:50:39.080]  like I want to fight. That's what the word repugnant means. It takes you back to the
[3:50:39.080 --> 3:50:43.400]  point where you think you really ought to fight over that. Why do you think you ought
[3:50:43.400 --> 3:50:49.840]  to fight over that? Because there's more to being a human being than these external
[3:50:49.840 --> 3:50:56.400]  things like that. Even the externalized attributes like that that we can appreciate. But if the
[3:50:56.400 --> 3:51:02.880]  whole thing doesn't come together in a way that respects the meaning of the human person,
[3:51:02.880 --> 3:51:09.960]  the meaning of the whole package, then you could have literacy programs and people taken
[3:51:09.960 --> 3:51:13.840]  out of poverty and you're not treating them like people. You're not treating them like
[3:51:13.840 --> 3:51:19.440]  persons. You're not treating them like human beings. That's what I think is happening in
[3:51:19.440 --> 3:51:24.640]  China right now. I think China has a regime in which they have all kinds of wonderful
[3:51:24.640 --> 3:51:31.640]  material goals for everybody. The one goal they don't have is to treat people like people.
[3:51:31.640 --> 3:51:38.080]  Because if you don't treat people in a way that respects their God endowed, unalienable
[3:51:38.080 --> 3:51:44.200]  rights, that sense that makes them responsible for the choices they make and keeping those
[3:51:44.200 --> 3:51:50.600]  choices in line with a standard of right and justice that applies to everybody like them
[3:51:50.600 --> 3:51:55.280]  in the world, all the human beings in the world, and also, by the way, if you take
[3:51:55.280 --> 3:52:02.600]  Christ seriously, all creation so that all things work together for good, then you're
[3:52:02.600 --> 3:52:08.480]  going to get into serious trouble. And that's why the statement that somehow or another
[3:52:08.480 --> 3:52:13.240]  asks a justification for all the millions of people murdered by communist regimes and
[3:52:13.240 --> 3:52:18.360]  totalitarian regimes and all the repression and all the death camps and all the gulags
[3:52:18.360 --> 3:52:23.520]  and to this day what's being done to Uyghurs and others, where their conscience is not
[3:52:23.520 --> 3:52:29.320]  being respected. They're being put in camps because they think that they ought to be worshiping
[3:52:29.320 --> 3:52:35.000]  God and trying to do right in a certain way that's harmless to others, but that they must
[3:52:35.000 --> 3:52:40.760]  stop because it doesn't follow your party line. That's starting to happen to Christians
[3:52:40.760 --> 3:52:47.560]  in this country. It's called freedom of religion, the exercise of religion, but it's important
[3:52:47.560 --> 3:52:54.880]  because as human beings, we must be encouraged to take responsibility for those issues, to
[3:52:54.880 --> 3:53:00.720]  look to the standard that's higher than the standard of our will and have some sense of
[3:53:00.720 --> 3:53:10.520]  how we mean to serve it and respect it. And in the ways that kind of take the common denominators
[3:53:10.520 --> 3:53:16.800]  of our concerns and try to put them in a codified form, the Constitution helps us to remember
[3:53:16.800 --> 3:53:22.240]  what some of those are. And among them is this business of not killing other people
[3:53:22.240 --> 3:53:25.920]  just because they're in our way or because we have the power to do so or because doing
[3:53:25.920 --> 3:53:30.760]  so will help us to feel better and maybe get happier and something. It's taking seriously
[3:53:30.760 --> 3:53:38.360]  the responsibility that is encoded into this flesh reminding us that we're not just individuals,
[3:53:38.360 --> 3:53:45.360]  that we are bound somehow through the will of our Creator to an obligation that has to
[3:53:45.360 --> 3:53:50.560]  do with whether or not this whole human race that we're part of with all its diversity
[3:53:50.560 --> 3:53:55.800]  and everything, whether that's going to be perpetuated, that's procreation. We're treating
[3:53:55.800 --> 3:54:01.520]  that aspect of our conscience now with the utmost carelessness and we think it's just
[3:54:01.520 --> 3:54:06.720]  one issue over here in the corner when in fact it is an issue where the thread of truth
[3:54:06.720 --> 3:54:14.360]  that it involves underlies everything we're supposed to be as a people and therefore everything
[3:54:14.360 --> 3:54:22.720]  we must be respected in as persons. Get that? We need to start seeing these things in their
[3:54:22.720 --> 3:54:29.360]  right context. If we keep allowing ourselves to pretend that they're just isolated points
[3:54:29.360 --> 3:54:37.080]  of light or darkness here or there or other where then we're shredding the foundations
[3:54:37.080 --> 3:54:45.040]  of our way of life and we're shredding the fabric in our character and in fact for our
[3:54:45.040 --> 3:54:53.000]  claim and ability to maintain this way of life which invites people who are willing to
[3:54:53.000 --> 3:55:00.800]  listen to the information of righteousness within them to participate in the key decisions
[3:55:00.800 --> 3:55:08.240]  that determine not only their individual destiny but the destiny of their whole family, community,
[3:55:08.240 --> 3:55:16.600]  nation, even world. That's at the heart of our citizenship. Well, I hope that that makes
[3:55:16.600 --> 3:55:22.240]  some sense to you and that you'll notice it as we go through various issues. If I get
[3:55:22.240 --> 3:55:27.520]  a chance to share time with you in the future, as it's somewhere always in the back of my
[3:55:27.520 --> 3:55:34.280]  mind and I guess it's because given my background I had to wrestle with this a lot and at the
[3:55:34.280 --> 3:55:39.440]  end of the day I came to love my country, the United States of America, not because
[3:55:39.440 --> 3:55:46.360]  it had done everything right and people were always wonderful to me or in general but because
[3:55:46.360 --> 3:55:54.360]  people's time and again finally decided that the ideas of common humanity that respect
[3:55:54.360 --> 3:56:03.500]  our individual responsibility to God to respect the meaning of human life, not just its physical
[3:56:03.500 --> 3:56:10.480]  necessities and attributes and consequences. But that's common ground for us and it's common
[3:56:10.480 --> 3:56:16.840]  ground that I think is more than worthwhile. It's common ground that deserves the sacrifice
[3:56:16.840 --> 3:56:24.200]  of life that so many Americans have made in the name of liberty, not as the freedom to
[3:56:24.200 --> 3:56:31.760]  do what you please but as the freedom to please God by doing in righteousness what upholds
[3:56:31.760 --> 3:56:41.320]  the meaning of life, the respect for the wholesomeness of life in individuals and in the community
[3:56:41.320 --> 3:56:49.440]  we can build together when we respect that ground or foundation. You see that? Well I
[3:56:49.440 --> 3:56:53.800]  hope you do and I'll keep trying to get more and more people to see it. That's all I've
[3:56:53.800 --> 3:56:58.240]  been about for the last little while and it's all I'll be about I think as I get closer
[3:56:58.240 --> 3:57:06.880]  and closer to the time when I get a little rest hopefully in God and because I think
[3:57:06.880 --> 3:57:11.400]  that over time you learn you've got to walk that walk. It's better for others and it probably
[3:57:11.400 --> 3:57:16.480]  will turn out to be overall better for me, better for everybody. Well anyway War Room
[3:57:16.480 --> 3:57:23.160]  with Owen Schwier is next. Alex and Owen by the way are live at CPAC tonight so that
[3:57:23.160 --> 3:57:40.040]  should be exciting and I will be back tomorrow so take care until then.
