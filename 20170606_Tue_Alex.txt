[00:00:02.082 --> 00:00:07.446]  The collusion argument, which a lot of Democrats state as a fact.
[00:00:07.446 --> 00:00:09.008]  Like, oh, the collusion case.
[00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:12.250]  There is no collusion case.
[00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:17.334]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[00:00:17.334 --> 00:00:26.842]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that.
[00:00:26.842 --> 00:00:28.983]  We came, we saw, he died.
[00:00:31.178 --> 00:00:35.983]  The intervention led by NATO to topple Gaddafi has led to a failed state.
[00:00:40.768 --> 00:00:47.813]  Maybe Libya was not perfect under Gaddafi, but it had, even if to some extent, a functioning government, one unified country.
[00:00:47.813 --> 00:00:50.895]  It was a sovereign state.
[00:00:50.895 --> 00:00:57.820]  Libya now has two rival governments, a civil war that has left over 4,000 people dead, and its cities are in ruin.
[00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:04.325]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be.
[00:01:04.725 --> 00:01:09.532]  Women are treated discriminated against in all these countries she took money against.
[00:01:09.532 --> 00:01:13.077]  Gays and lesbians are either executed or punished severely.
[00:01:13.077 --> 00:01:14.639]  They're mistreated.
[00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:16.302]  She claims to be their champion.
[00:01:16.302 --> 00:01:17.223]  We led ISIS!
[00:01:18.226 --> 00:01:19.867]  Take this position.
[00:01:19.867 --> 00:01:26.012]  It was Hillary Clinton that she should get an award from them as the founder of ISIS.
[00:01:26.012 --> 00:01:38.181]  We had this brilliant idea that we were going to come to Pakistan and create a force of Mujahideen, equip them with stinger missiles and everything else to go after the Soviets inside Afghanistan.
[00:01:38.181 --> 00:01:39.402]  And we were successful.
[00:01:39.402 --> 00:01:41.604]  And this really just is so disgusting.
[00:01:41.704 --> 00:01:48.949]  When Vince Foster left his White House office on that July day in 1993, he told his secretary that he would be back.
[00:01:48.949 --> 00:01:53.293]  But the Deputy White House Counsel and boyhood friend of Bill Clinton never returned.
[00:01:53.293 --> 00:01:57.056]  There has been this urgency to end this.
[00:01:57.056 --> 00:02:00.818]  And, you know, historically that makes no sense.
[00:02:00.818 --> 00:02:05.542]  We all remember Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June in California.
[00:02:05.782 --> 00:02:15.266]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story.
[00:02:15.266 --> 00:02:17.427]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[00:02:17.427 --> 00:02:28.831]  If a Google user types in Clinton body, they get car repair shop results instead of a story that talks about a list of people tied to the Clintons who have died under mysterious circumstances over the last three decades.
[00:02:29.131 --> 00:02:34.036]  Whistleblowers go to significant efforts to get us material and often very significant risks.
[00:02:34.036 --> 00:02:37.560]  We have upcoming leaks in relation to Hillary Clinton.
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:45.008]  You know, the emails we published show that Hillary Clinton is receiving constant updates about my personal situation.
[00:02:45.148 --> 00:02:50.971]  The latest story was the death of DNC staffer Seth Rich, who was murdered last month in an apparent robbery.
[00:02:50.971 --> 00:02:58.095]  WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has hinted that Rich was his source, but has made no further comments about the case.
[00:02:58.095 --> 00:03:00.456]  That murder, we should say, remains unsolved.
[00:03:00.456 --> 00:03:10.622]  He's a 27-year-old, works for the DNC, who was shot in the back, murdered just two weeks ago for unknown reasons as he was walking down the street in Washington.
[00:03:10.882 --> 00:03:15.948]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[00:03:15.948 --> 00:03:22.476]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be.
[00:03:30.177 --> 00:03:47.377]  I don't know how dark your heart's gotta be, Hillary, to openly finance the Arab Spring with Google, and with George Soros, and with NATO, and with England, and France, and others, and turn the Middle East and North Africa over to the most radical jihadis in the world.
[00:03:48.158 --> 00:04:01.627]  Or to make a deal with the UN to oversee our State Department and the refugee program, and to flood us with unvetted refugees from failed states, where they don't even have working passport systems like Sudan and Somalia.
[00:04:01.627 --> 00:04:04.669]  Where the Imam issues it, basically.
[00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:10.813]  And then you call that extreme, and pseudo-intellectuals like Stephen Colbert make jokes about it.
[00:04:10.813 --> 00:04:15.677]  Well now Hillary, with all the different terror attacks we're seeing in Paris and Australia,
[00:04:17.398 --> 00:04:18.459]  Unfolding right now.
[00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:25.244]  Her answer is, way to stop terrorism is to understand other cultures and their food.
[00:04:25.244 --> 00:04:27.846]  Close quote.
[00:04:27.846 --> 00:04:30.408]  Spoken like a true psychopath trying to act like she's a human.
[00:04:31.377 --> 00:04:43.421]  Yeah, how about you throw a leg of lamb at an Islamicist that's trying to kill you while they scream Allah Akbar and try to stab you and your wife or daughter's eyeballs out with some type of butcher knife.
[00:04:43.421 --> 00:04:44.241]  It's amazing.
[00:04:44.241 --> 00:04:46.882]  It's all coming up today and a bunch of huge guests.
[00:04:46.882 --> 00:04:48.663]  And Megyn Kelly!
[00:04:48.663 --> 00:04:52.964]  Oh yeah, Megyn Kelly is going to be invading the building.
[00:04:52.964 --> 00:04:55.025]  Like when they say an empire strikes back.
[00:04:55.025 --> 00:04:56.786]  Imperial troops have entered the base!
[00:04:56.786 --> 00:04:57.886]  Imperial troops have entered the base!
[00:05:03.911 --> 00:05:05.752]  The collapse of the left continues.
[00:05:05.752 --> 00:05:10.456]  After Kathy Griffin's epic meltdown, Bill Maher is now the latest under fire for a public statement.
[00:05:10.456 --> 00:05:13.138]  Here's Bill Maher in an interview with Senator Ben Sasse.
[00:05:13.138 --> 00:05:14.219]  You're welcome.
[00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:17.121]  We'd love to have you work in the fields with us.
[00:05:17.121 --> 00:05:17.962]  Work in the fields?
[00:05:17.962 --> 00:05:24.487]  That's part of the... That's... Senator, I'm a house... I can't sleep at night.
[00:05:25.347 --> 00:05:28.949]  So Bill Maher uses a racial slur while interviewing a senator.
[00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:33.150]  But remember, the left does eat its own, and liberals are now calling for his firing.
[00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:39.693]  Perhaps Bill Maher, who recognizes the reality of radical Islamic terror, may also recognize the reality of the insane left.
[00:05:39.693 --> 00:05:51.298]  While I don't believe this is anywhere near as bad as Griffin, and shouldn't cost him his job, I do believe that this is just another example of the left crashing and burning, which will only mean more sweet victory in the next round of elections.
[00:05:51.298 --> 00:05:53.519]  This is Owen Schroer for InfoWars.com.
[00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:54.640]  Are you tired of winning yet?
[00:06:03.334 --> 00:06:07.096]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:06:07.096 --> 00:06:14.841]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:06:14.841 --> 00:06:23.446]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:06:23.446 --> 00:06:27.869]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:06:27.869 --> 00:06:30.070]  Pathenogens added to the food and water,
[00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:37.694]  To the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[00:06:37.694 --> 00:06:41.115]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[00:06:41.115 --> 00:06:52.161]  AnthroPlex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[00:06:52.261 --> 00:06:55.142]  Discover why Anthroplex is turning so many heads today.
[00:06:55.142 --> 00:06:58.223]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands.
[00:06:58.223 --> 00:07:01.724]  And it starts at Infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[00:07:01.724 --> 00:07:03.645]  Embrix Essentials, that's my middle name.
[00:07:03.645 --> 00:07:16.089]  I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic and high quality.
[00:07:16.089 --> 00:07:21.851]  This is one of the top three selling organic brands in the country that puts out
[00:07:22.031 --> 00:07:25.214]  High-quality organic shampoo, mouthwash, you name it.
[00:07:25.214 --> 00:07:29.858]  And they're such patriots, they have let us basically keep their well-known packaging.
[00:07:29.858 --> 00:07:36.984]  It is an answer to prayer, and because we're cutting out the middleman, 20% off retail, sign up for auto-ship, an additional 25% off.
[00:07:36.984 --> 00:07:38.145]  It's all there.
[00:07:38.145 --> 00:07:43.570]  The body wash, the shampoo, the deodorant, the mouthwash, all of it is truly game-changing.
[00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:47.434]  It is the exact same product, just the name is different, Emrix Essentials,
[00:07:47.694 --> 00:07:54.295]  And it's on average 20% off what it would be in stores, buying it directly from InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:07:54.295 --> 00:07:56.896]  Help us win the Info War while getting products everybody needs.
[00:07:56.896 --> 00:08:07.758]  InfoWarsLife.com, where you'll find the entire line of Emmerich's essentials.
[00:08:07.758 --> 00:08:14.520]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.800]  You better believe you've got one!
[00:08:18.993 --> 00:08:24.135]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:29.178 --> 00:08:35.360]  We are coming to you live from deep in the heart of Texas on Tuesday, the 6th day of June 2017.
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:44.462]  We are teleprompter free, but we've got Megyn Kelly's crew here and she, I guess Darth Vader herself, is going to be arriving a little bit later in the next hour.
[00:08:44.462 --> 00:08:47.643]  So I look forward to being interviewed for her new program.
[00:08:47.643 --> 00:08:50.583]  She just interviewed Putin, that was a big success.
[00:08:50.583 --> 00:08:54.044]  Then I guess Trump's next, so I'm honored to be in that lineup.
[00:08:54.044 --> 00:08:54.864]  So it should be fun.
[00:08:54.864 --> 00:08:56.805]  The crew's pretty excited about it.
[00:08:58.319 --> 00:09:08.122]  But I never even had any writers in exchange for doing this interview, but I did think that once she gets here, we need to try to at least holler in front of the cameras a little bit.
[00:09:08.122 --> 00:09:11.623]  Or if they don't air the interview, they'll say it never happened.
[00:09:11.623 --> 00:09:17.946]  But seriously, we'll definitely get you a Twitter picture or something like that out in the next few hours.
[00:09:17.946 --> 00:09:21.847]  But it all remains to be seen how the interview goes.
[00:09:22.802 --> 00:09:44.074]  Wow, we have got really some tragic news as usual for you in the month of Ramadan, the terror extravaganza month that comes around every year where you see Coptic Christians blown up and synagogues blown up and Shiite mosques blown up and Sunni mosques blown up and Alawite mosques blown up and churches blown up in Europe and
[00:09:45.868 --> 00:09:54.525]  Ariana Grande concerts with young girls blown into bits by psychopathic killers that have nothing to do with Islam.
[00:09:55.410 --> 00:10:00.193]  Mayor Kahn, who's turning London into Lundistan, has said that.
[00:10:00.193 --> 00:10:05.477]  He says the problem is our President Donald Trump, and he wants him banned.
[00:10:05.477 --> 00:10:08.339]  He does not want him to come to London.
[00:10:08.339 --> 00:10:15.043]  He says he's not welcome, and he wants the government to ban him entering the country, just like Michael Savage and thousands of others are.
[00:10:15.043 --> 00:10:16.064]  For what?
[00:10:16.064 --> 00:10:18.766]  Criticizing the religion of peace.
[00:10:20.748 --> 00:10:23.490]  Meanwhile, Notre Dame hammered attack.
[00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:25.792]  Investigators, terror officer and suspect hurt.
[00:10:25.792 --> 00:10:29.735]  He was trying to kill people reportedly with a hammer, screaming Allah Akbar as usual.
[00:10:29.735 --> 00:10:33.338]  Paris police officer attacked with hammer outside Notre Dame.
[00:10:33.338 --> 00:10:35.820]  Ramadan, Australia.
[00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:37.741]  Not even the Joey's are safe.
[00:10:37.741 --> 00:10:40.283]  Why, look at that jihadi crikey.
[00:10:40.283 --> 00:10:42.125]  Gunman takes hostages.
[00:10:42.125 --> 00:10:43.546]  Not funny for them, is it?
[00:10:43.546 --> 00:10:44.587]  The religion of peace.
[00:10:44.587 --> 00:10:46.989]  Tells TV station, this is for ISIS.
[00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:50.361]  Isn't that nice?
[00:10:50.361 --> 00:10:55.484]  Of course they were stabbing and killing people and running over them with cars just a few days ago in London.
[00:10:55.484 --> 00:10:58.446]  London Bridge!
[00:10:58.446 --> 00:11:03.409]  Screaming, this is for Allah and Allah Akbar, but it had nothing to do with Islam.
[00:11:03.409 --> 00:11:06.972]  Notre Dame, man, shot by French police again after terror attack.
[00:11:08.853 --> 00:11:10.994]  149 dead so far in Ramadan attacks.
[00:11:10.994 --> 00:11:13.315]  Daily Caller breaks down that chronicle.
[00:11:13.315 --> 00:11:19.677]  Former Islamic extremist warns Britain is in the midst of a jihadist insurgency.
[00:11:19.677 --> 00:11:22.218]  It's just like the Intifada and things in Israel.
[00:11:22.218 --> 00:11:36.124]  London terrorist was allowed to work at tube station despite being known jihadist who traveled back and forth, Scotland Yard confirms, at leisure to Libya where his father fought as a terrorist.
[00:11:38.166 --> 00:11:43.469]  But it's okay, because it has nothing to do with Islam and nothing to do with Jihad.
[00:11:43.469 --> 00:11:50.132]  And if you say Islam has anything to do with Jihad, or that Jihad's even in the Quran, you're fake news.
[00:11:50.132 --> 00:12:02.418]  So says the same MSN that tells us Obamacare is going to be free, you didn't build your own business, and that Hillary Clinton doesn't look like a cross between a lot lizard and some type of overcooked pizza.
[00:12:02.418 --> 00:12:03.219]  Now, continuing.
[00:12:06.516 --> 00:12:07.959]  How bad is this going to get?
[00:12:07.959 --> 00:12:09.682]  Well, the answer is really bad.
[00:12:09.682 --> 00:12:14.812]  But what's really disgusting is the propaganda out of both the left and right wing, especially in the UK.
[00:12:16.417 --> 00:12:23.242]  What we need is total surveillance over the internet, they say, Theresa May, the Prime Minister, and we need to basically ban extremist talk.
[00:12:23.242 --> 00:12:42.936]  Well, I get banned all the time and restricted on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, that's Google, Google delist our stories, and they'll say, oh, this is an extremist comment, your video is extremist, and the community has decided, and then I go look at the community that's doing it, and it's usually a bunch of jihadis, or leftists,
[00:12:43.925 --> 00:12:59.689]  College students that are admittedly going around in brigades, going and flagging things, and it'll be a video where I simply show some Islamists saying, we're going to take over the West, we're going to kill you, we're going to enslave you.
[00:12:59.689 --> 00:13:02.550]  And they will then say, we say this is not allowed.
[00:13:07.264 --> 00:13:20.553]  The type of stuff that gets flagged and blocked is where right-wing watch had the true accurate clip in the same two-minute clip where I said, I don't know if Hillary's killing kids in devil worshiping ceremonies, like the new House of Cards episode.
[00:13:20.553 --> 00:13:25.937]  I don't know if she's killing kids in a basement, but I know she funded jihadists and radicals all over the Middle East.
[00:13:25.937 --> 00:13:28.479]  She came, she saw, Gaddafi died.
[00:13:29.019 --> 00:13:54.036]  They went into Syria, they started the civil war, and hundreds of thousands have died, and ISIS has sold tens of thousands of women and children to sex slavery, and they rape these little kids to death in some cases, and murder them, and it's all over mainstream news, they're selling women as sex slaves out of Libya now, after the West made a failed state, so she is guilty of helping create ISIS, and funding it, and she's guilty of murdering children!
[00:13:54.036 --> 00:13:56.078]  And Megyn Kelly on Fox News!
[00:13:57.375 --> 00:14:11.813]  sat there and played the clip with the front and the back chopped off of the same two minute clip or minute and a half clip to where I said she was in a basement Hillary murdering children in a pizza place.
[00:14:11.813 --> 00:14:14.557]  Then they take a little correction I do on other people's reporting
[00:14:15.646 --> 00:14:18.367]  And then say that I was correcting myself on that.
[00:14:18.367 --> 00:14:21.327]  That's how you produce fake news.
[00:14:21.327 --> 00:14:26.228]  And when I asked Megyn Kelly about it a few weeks ago on the phone, the conversation was off the record.
[00:14:26.228 --> 00:14:30.029]  She just, this part I'm going to tell you about, she said, I don't remember that.
[00:14:30.029 --> 00:14:30.929]  I don't remember that.
[00:14:30.929 --> 00:14:39.071]  So today, when she's here, it won't be on film, certainly they don't want that, but I'm going to sit there, because that's part of the condition of her coming here, and I'm going to show her right when we watch.
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:43.981]  That was hating me and attacking me, but at least they admitted it was a tongue-in-cheek piece I did.
[00:14:43.981 --> 00:14:47.222]  And then we're going to show her what her producers did.
[00:14:47.222 --> 00:14:49.423]  Because that is fake news right there.
[00:14:49.423 --> 00:14:54.584]  So I want to know if she stands for that because, look, in fact, here's the video since her crew is here.
[00:14:54.584 --> 00:14:57.845]  Let's punch the video up on screen for TV viewers.
[00:14:57.845 --> 00:14:59.085]  You can pull up the article.
[00:14:59.085 --> 00:15:02.106]  Exclusive Megyn Kelly caught fabricating lies about Alex Jones.
[00:15:02.106 --> 00:15:03.706]  And I don't hate Megyn Kelly.
[00:15:03.706 --> 00:15:07.688]  I used to like her when she, you know, was there reading the news on Fox News or whatever.
[00:15:07.688 --> 00:15:08.908]  When she came purely political,
[00:15:10.086 --> 00:15:15.709]  I started disliking her, and then when she had her producers do that to me, I really got upset.
[00:15:15.709 --> 00:15:19.691]  That's why I'm gonna break down and cry right now.
[00:15:19.691 --> 00:15:26.395]  Make sarcastic, I actually need to wet my throat a bit here.
[00:15:26.395 --> 00:15:28.556]  Because we are teleprompting free news.
[00:15:28.556 --> 00:15:32.358]  So, that's all coming up today as well.
[00:15:32.358 --> 00:15:37.461]  But first off, let's get to Hillary Clinton, since we've been talking about this vicious, evil,
[00:15:38.928 --> 00:15:40.510]  True Wicked Witch.
[00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:50.119]  I mean, the lady in Wizard of Oz disappearing into a cloud of green smoke has nothing on Hillary and her consortium of flying monkeys.
[00:15:50.119 --> 00:15:51.280]  So here is Hillary Clinton.
[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:53.823]  The story is up on InfoWars.com.
[00:15:53.823 --> 00:15:55.705]  It's a Paul Joseph Watson article.
[00:15:55.705 --> 00:16:02.291]  Hillary, way to stop terrorism is to understand other cultures and their food.
[00:16:02.291 --> 00:16:02.632]  Here it is.
[00:16:03.846 --> 00:16:16.429]  This is a time for us to reach out to the world, to understand more about what is happening, not just in our own country, but indeed across the globe.
[00:16:16.429 --> 00:16:27.512]  It's a time for steady, determined leadership, like we are seeing from local authorities in London, including the Mayor of London.
[00:16:27.512 --> 00:16:29.313]  And it is a time to remember.
[00:16:31.516 --> 00:16:34.719]  How important our alliances are.
[00:16:34.719 --> 00:16:36.921]  You heard from Victor.
[00:16:36.921 --> 00:16:38.682]  You heard from Maya.
[00:16:38.682 --> 00:16:41.825]  You heard from the Congressman.
[00:16:41.825 --> 00:16:44.387]  Getting to know one another.
[00:16:44.387 --> 00:16:50.412]  Learning about the experiences, the lives, the cultures, the religions, the food!
[00:16:56.405 --> 00:17:18.735]  So, if you're just nice to Islam, and if you move to Saudi Arabia, or you move to Qatar, or you move to Sudan, or you move to Libya, or you move to Rwanda, where now Muslims are coming in and attacking, or Nigeria, where they're bombing people and shooting people almost every day, if you go to Somalia,
[00:17:19.718 --> 00:17:27.140]  I mean, how dare President Trump block flights of people with Somali passports to the U.S.
[00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:28.881]  Of course, they're known to be terrorists.
[00:17:28.881 --> 00:17:31.422]  They're known to issue them to terrorists.
[00:17:31.422 --> 00:17:35.703]  They're known to support terrorism and piracy against everybody.
[00:17:35.703 --> 00:17:36.903]  And that's okay!
[00:17:36.903 --> 00:17:39.964]  We've got to let those people in unvetted.
[00:17:39.964 --> 00:17:42.985]  And I think the President's wrong.
[00:17:42.985 --> 00:17:47.947]  I think we should actually import Somali pirates
[00:17:49.301 --> 00:17:58.204]  To, say, Galveston Bay, and just let them rob and murder and kill there, too, because that's their culture, and all cultures are equal.
[00:17:58.204 --> 00:18:05.126]  I think we should get the time machine, bring back the Aztecs, and just let them set up in our neighborhoods, grab our kids out of backyards, and chop their hearts out.
[00:18:05.126 --> 00:18:09.187]  Of course, I'm being sarcastic, but that's how crazy this is.
[00:18:09.187 --> 00:18:11.347]  The Nazis were an evil culture.
[00:18:11.347 --> 00:18:12.988]  We don't need to accept it.
[00:18:12.988 --> 00:18:16.609]  The Aztecs were an evil culture by the time they collapsed.
[00:18:18.376 --> 00:18:24.915]  We can look at cultures that are bad and say this isn't good and currently the orthodox Islam that is the
[00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:36.882]  Exploding ideology and political and religious system on the planet today is going through its reformation.
[00:18:36.882 --> 00:18:55.046]  This is Islam's reformation getting back to the roots of robbing the caravans there at Mecca 1,500 years ago, 1,400 years ago, the slave trade coming out of the slave trade there at the Four Corners, there at the crossroads of the caravans of the spice
[00:18:56.307 --> 00:19:04.070]  ...of the Silk Roads, where you grab the women, you sell the children, you have the slave pitch, you rob your neighbors, you do this.
[00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:05.691]  Women are not humans.
[00:19:05.691 --> 00:19:08.352]  You can do what you want with them.
[00:19:08.352 --> 00:19:12.233]  The Koran says black people aren't humans.
[00:19:12.233 --> 00:19:21.616]  And then by the time the liberal media turns it around, black folks run out and convert to Islam, because that's what you do, because the Muslims started the modern global slave trade 1,400 years ago.
[00:19:23.953 --> 00:19:32.877]  But by the time MSM's done with it, the West, England that ended global slavery, except in a few Islamic countries today, it gets the blame.
[00:19:32.877 --> 00:19:34.538]  And America gets the blame.
[00:19:34.538 --> 00:19:36.198]  The West gets the blame.
[00:19:36.198 --> 00:19:39.780]  The Republicans that passed the Civil Rights Act, they get the blame.
[00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:43.922]  The Democrats that are the KKK party, they are the people that fight the racism.
[00:19:43.922 --> 00:19:46.143]  Arnold Schwarzenegger says he loves Hitler.
[00:19:46.143 --> 00:19:47.523]  He gets ADL awards.
[00:19:47.523 --> 00:19:48.744]  I say I hate Hitler.
[00:19:48.744 --> 00:19:50.345]  I'm attacked by the ADL.
[00:19:50.345 --> 00:19:51.905]  Upside down world.
[00:19:51.905 --> 00:19:52.606]  See how it works.
[00:19:53.246 --> 00:19:57.598]  When we come back, we've got big news on the Mayor of Londonstown.
[00:19:57.598 --> 00:20:00.105]  Yes, he's feeling very powerful right now.
[00:20:02.205 --> 00:20:04.087]  Fully cooked, ready-to-eat bacon.
[00:20:04.087 --> 00:20:07.309]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center-cut, presidential bacon.

[00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:11.752]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.

[00:24:05.791 --> 00:24:11.816]  Let me tell you who's coming up on the broadcast today.
[00:24:36.994 --> 00:24:43.779]  We have Tommy Robbins obviously right there in the middle of London stand with the ongoing terror attacks that happen every few days.
[00:24:43.779 --> 00:24:44.580]  He'll be popping in.
[00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:51.946]  We have Ben Garrison, the amazing cartoonist, who I think is the emblematic political cartoonist of our age.
[00:24:51.946 --> 00:24:55.148]  There's some other great people, Anthony Frida, he's just not as prolific.
[00:24:55.148 --> 00:24:56.810]  There's some other great folks out there as well.
[00:24:58.814 --> 00:25:00.395]  Bracco, I think's his name.
[00:25:00.395 --> 00:25:01.495]  Bracco.
[00:25:01.495 --> 00:25:04.936]  But when you get down to it, it is Ben Garrison.
[00:25:04.936 --> 00:25:06.256]  It's simply amazing.
[00:25:06.256 --> 00:25:12.899]  By the way, we sell his new book that is a compendium of many of his best political cartoons.
[00:25:12.899 --> 00:25:19.461]  A great way to wake people up, to have it on your coffee table, or give it to a libtard in your family.
[00:25:21.055 --> 00:25:22.956]  Or to leave one at the barbershop.
[00:25:22.956 --> 00:25:24.337]  This is an information war.
[00:25:24.337 --> 00:25:26.578]  Or go donate one to the library.
[00:25:26.578 --> 00:25:28.959]  Then thousands of people will read it.
[00:25:28.959 --> 00:25:40.886]  And you have to have that information warfare perspective that you understand that every heart and every mind we reach is a major victory against the globals and we have turned the tide.
[00:25:40.886 --> 00:25:44.288]  Their global government, TPP, is destroyed.
[00:25:44.288 --> 00:25:47.529]  Their global carbon tax, the Paris Accord, is on fire.
[00:25:47.529 --> 00:25:50.371]  This is irrevocable damage to the New World Order.
[00:25:51.786 --> 00:26:05.492]  The above-the-law corporatocracy that they've denied existed in Bilderberg and all of it, and it's out in the open, and then Hollywood and all the low-information voters on Facebook are just, he's stomping the earth, he hates the earth!
[00:26:05.492 --> 00:26:11.114]  Now America and Europe won't be the only ones with carbon taxes to shut off our economies!
[00:26:11.114 --> 00:26:11.534]  Oh no!
[00:26:14.522 --> 00:26:18.144]  Now there'll be less dirty plants in China because the plants won't get built there.
[00:26:18.144 --> 00:26:20.686]  They'll get built here where it's totally clean.
[00:26:20.686 --> 00:26:21.626]  No!
[00:26:21.626 --> 00:26:23.947]  It's not true!
[00:26:23.947 --> 00:26:25.268]  It's impossible!
[00:26:25.268 --> 00:26:26.349]  No, Trump!
[00:26:26.349 --> 00:26:27.630]  Don't kill the Earth!
[00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:29.311]  No, we're saviors of the Earth!
[00:26:30.211 --> 00:26:31.751]  We've been cast as the saviors.
[00:26:31.751 --> 00:26:36.912]  We're just a bunch of idiots that are trendy and don't have jobs and have two or three college degrees that are worthless.
[00:26:36.912 --> 00:26:46.214]  But we listen to Stephen Colbert and we want to feel important and you're the bad guy hurting us and trying to keep the jihadis out.
[00:26:46.214 --> 00:26:48.815]  I mean, think about how crazy he is.
[00:26:48.815 --> 00:26:53.716]  In total failed states where the imams issue the passports like Somalia.
[00:26:53.716 --> 00:26:57.897]  He says they can't come in from Somalia.
[00:26:57.897 --> 00:26:58.877]  Bad man!
[00:26:59.637 --> 00:27:00.398]  Batman!
[00:27:00.398 --> 00:27:04.001]  I mean, think about how evil Trump is.
[00:27:04.001 --> 00:27:07.043]  And every time there's another terror attack, he's proven wrong, see?
[00:27:07.043 --> 00:27:20.735]  Because he said there'd be more terror attacks, because you let in people from third-world Islamic hellholes that are all killing each other, and they're totally crazed, and have a culture of not working, just murdering each other, and walking around in nightgowns, and they wipe their asses with their hands, and they're just total, complete
[00:27:21.275 --> 00:27:30.177]  These fiend demons that cut their children's genitals off and put hoods over women's heads and beat them to death if they talk back and rape any women they want.
[00:27:30.177 --> 00:27:36.119]  The woman complains she gets charged with sex crimes and throw gays off buildings and murder everybody.
[00:27:36.119 --> 00:27:44.221]  How about Trump bans people from any country that throw gays off buildings and the governments openly certify it and say it's good?
[00:27:44.221 --> 00:27:47.902]  How about people are banned from any country where women have to wear hoods over their heads?
[00:27:48.923 --> 00:27:51.384]  Oh, but the media spends the whole thing!
[00:27:51.384 --> 00:27:57.207]  And they sit there and they say, oh, actually, the answer here is that we should all wear hijabs.
[00:27:57.207 --> 00:27:59.728]  This is a sign of feminism!
[00:27:59.728 --> 00:28:17.037]  So the West is horrible and evil, and all over the country at campuses, they're having no-whites days, run by the faculty, creating total racism and division under multiculturalism, and they're bringing in incompatible, most radical forms of vile Islam that is a true cult!
[00:28:18.152 --> 00:28:27.595]  Islam, in its orthodox Wahhabist form, is the biggest, oldest, most dangerous, murderous, incompatible, cancerous cult on the planet!
[00:28:27.595 --> 00:28:38.998]  But they have official UN videos and German TV ads put out by the state government with their rock stars and their music stars first wearing turbans and going, I wear the hijab, it's fun!
[00:28:38.998 --> 00:28:41.279]  And the next, it's a real hijab!
[00:28:41.279 --> 00:28:43.700]  And then it's a beekeeper suit over their heads!
[00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:46.961]  And those of us that see this cult taking over, we get upset about it!
[00:28:48.254 --> 00:29:03.001]  Because we know our government, and the left, and the globalists, and the Ford Foundation, is out there financing and fomenting every incompatible system, every authoritarian system, to bring them into our countries and then let them have their way with us.
[00:29:03.001 --> 00:29:12.985]  So that they can then turn around and say, oh, we gotta surveil all of you, oh, we have to control the internet, oh, we have to censor everybody, oh, we have to take your rights away, oh, we gotta get rid of this and that and everything else, gotta have all this happen.
[00:29:12.985 --> 00:29:16.127]  Meanwhile, England won't let its citizens have guns to defend themselves.
[00:29:17.449 --> 00:29:29.877]  And they bring in absolute murderous scum who are admittedly part of jihad groups who fought in Libya and fought in Syria, overthrowing those countries and murdering people.
[00:29:29.877 --> 00:29:32.899]  And then they bring them back and wonder why they're killing people.
[00:29:32.899 --> 00:29:36.901]  And Trump says, if you fought for ISIS, you shouldn't be allowed back in the country.
[00:29:36.901 --> 00:29:39.043]  How about you should be dead?
[00:29:39.043 --> 00:29:44.166]  How about instead of deporting these people that fought for ISIS, we give them a real quick trial and then we hang their asses.
[00:29:44.426 --> 00:29:45.226]  I'll be there.
[00:29:45.226 --> 00:29:46.327]  I'll kick the lever.
[00:29:46.327 --> 00:29:51.349]  I'm ready to kill these people after a court finds them guilty of being mass murderers.
[00:29:51.349 --> 00:29:52.729]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.729 --> 00:29:55.270]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:57.951]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:05.991]  The collapse of the left continues.
[00:30:05.991 --> 00:30:10.694]  After Kathy Griffin's epic meltdown, Bill Maher is now the latest under fire for a public statement.
[00:30:10.694 --> 00:30:13.315]  Here's Bill Maher in an interview with Senator Ben Sasse.
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:29.181]  So Bill Maher uses a racial slur while interviewing a senator.
[00:30:29.181 --> 00:30:33.381]  But remember, the left does eat its own, and liberals are now calling for his firing.
[00:30:33.381 --> 00:30:39.922]  Perhaps Bill Maher, who recognizes the reality of radical Islamic terror, may also recognize the reality of the insane left.
[00:30:39.922 --> 00:30:48.004]  While I don't believe this is anywhere near as bad as Griffin, and shouldn't cost him his job, I do believe that this is just another example of the left crashing and burning.
[00:30:48.004 --> 00:30:51.524]  Which will only mean more sweet victory in the next round of elections.
[00:30:51.524 --> 00:30:53.745]  This is Owen Troyer for InfoWars.com.
[00:30:53.745 --> 00:30:54.885]  Are you tired of winning yet?
[00:31:02.199 --> 00:31:04.079]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[00:31:04.079 --> 00:31:06.120]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:09.021]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[00:31:09.021 --> 00:31:15.082]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[00:31:15.082 --> 00:31:24.284]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[00:31:24.284 --> 00:31:29.145]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children.
[00:31:29.445 --> 00:31:31.809]  Do the best job you can to purify your air.
[00:31:31.809 --> 00:31:39.844]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[00:31:39.844 --> 00:31:40.805]  The general public doesn't.
[00:31:42.006 --> 00:31:45.389]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[00:31:45.389 --> 00:31:49.533]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[00:31:49.533 --> 00:31:56.239]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[00:31:56.239 --> 00:32:00.363]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:12.974]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:32:12.974 --> 00:32:15.035]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:32:15.035 --> 00:32:17.917]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:32:17.917 --> 00:32:19.397]  It's made in the USA.
[00:32:19.397 --> 00:32:22.539]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[00:32:22.639 --> 00:32:26.222]  It's absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[00:32:26.222 --> 00:32:28.304]  It is a classical 360 win.
[00:32:28.304 --> 00:32:38.012]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:32:38.012 --> 00:32:50.343]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America,
[00:32:50.503 --> 00:32:54.827]  To reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:32:54.827 --> 00:32:58.110]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[00:32:58.110 --> 00:33:07.879]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield and Infowarslife.com.
[00:33:07.879 --> 00:33:13.464]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen.
[00:33:13.464 --> 00:33:16.307]  Right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:36.721 --> 00:33:38.322]  Welcome back, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:33:38.322 --> 00:33:53.529]  We've got a bunch of big guests coming up today, but before I get back into who's coming up, let me just explain what I just did earlier, so we can actually take this clip later and put it out as a video for the general public, not just our great audience of radio affiliates and TV stations and folks watching live right now on InfoWars.com.
[00:33:54.858 --> 00:34:05.122]  I deliberately this morning thought about how do I trigger a debate about radical orthodox Islam's tenet being kill everyone outside of Islam.
[00:34:05.122 --> 00:34:11.104]  That's why they're constantly killing other Muslims that they catch drinking or who are gay or lesbian or whatever.
[00:34:11.904 --> 00:34:13.706]  And I'm not even a gay or lesbian activist.
[00:34:13.706 --> 00:34:15.127]  I don't go to gay parades.
[00:34:15.127 --> 00:34:16.448]  I don't hate those people though.
[00:34:16.448 --> 00:34:18.090]  I want them to be able to have their own life.
[00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:21.653]  I'm upset by Islam running around killing them en masse.
[00:34:21.653 --> 00:34:30.500]  And you wonder why Islam continues to attack the gay bars and the little, you know, teeny bopper, Andrea Grande, liberal events.
[00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:36.385]  And they said, we don't like a bunch of young women dancing around without male escorts.
[00:34:36.385 --> 00:34:36.966]  We're gonna kill them!
[00:34:38.291 --> 00:34:39.753]  That was a sinful event!
[00:34:39.753 --> 00:34:48.262]  Teenage girls there listening to another woman posing as a teenage girl who, quote, hopes her effing fans die.
[00:34:48.262 --> 00:34:50.084]  Ariana Grande, a true pig-like creature.
[00:34:52.418 --> 00:34:57.562]  They're there, they get killed, and the media tries to cover up that it's Islamic, the usual thing.
[00:34:57.562 --> 00:35:06.569]  And so yes, I'm saying Trump's being called a radical for banning seven countries where they don't have real passport systems in many of them.
[00:35:06.569 --> 00:35:10.252]  Failed states like Libya, thanks to Hillary and Obama again.
[00:35:10.252 --> 00:35:12.734]  Failed states like Somalia.
[00:35:12.734 --> 00:35:16.177]  On and on and on, we accept the weirdo passports?
[00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:22.047]  that are issued by the caliphate with the symbol of Al-Qaeda.
[00:35:22.047 --> 00:35:24.270]  You know that black flag you see ISIS has?
[00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:24.831]  They all have?
[00:35:24.831 --> 00:35:27.034]  That's not the Al-Qaeda flag.
[00:35:27.034 --> 00:35:28.656]  That's the flag Al-Qaeda uses.
[00:35:28.656 --> 00:35:30.959]  That's the Wahhabist flag.
[00:35:32.577 --> 00:35:44.732]  And so, if they've been in battle zones, and are bragging about killing people, and posing in photographs with severed heads, type into mainstream news even reported there's sex slavery out of Libya now, where they're trafficking women and little girls.
[00:35:44.732 --> 00:35:46.614]  Type it into a search engine.
[00:35:46.614 --> 00:35:51.780]  So yes, if you're kidnapping and raping little girls, and if you're murdering people, and if you're making the
[00:35:52.748 --> 00:36:12.249]  Libyan military that was secular compared to you, eat their own bodies before you kill them so they go to hell, you believe, then I'm saying you deserve to be tried for crimes against humanity like the Nazis at Nuremberg and hung by the neck until dead just like those damn Nazis!
[00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:16.032]  But if I say, hang the Nazis, I'll kick the lever.
[00:36:16.032 --> 00:36:17.533]  Well, of course, that's good.
[00:36:17.533 --> 00:36:28.119]  But if I say I'd kick the lever for a convicted ISIS killer, I guarantee it's going to be on Media Matters and George Soros and others going, oh my gosh, he said he wants to kill people!
[00:36:28.119 --> 00:36:30.861]  I said after they're tried.
[00:36:30.861 --> 00:36:31.741]  After they're convicted.
[00:36:31.741 --> 00:36:34.583]  I don't personally want to get near them.
[00:36:34.583 --> 00:36:36.484]  And then watch them twitch and jerk.
[00:36:36.484 --> 00:36:39.046]  I just want those animals euthanized.
[00:36:41.152 --> 00:36:51.620]  But I'm saying I'd belly up if I had to and get near their stinking pig-like carcasses if I had to because they're a bunch of murdering trash.
[00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:59.086]  And so the president tries to stop this murdering trash from pouring into the country.
[00:36:59.086 --> 00:37:03.250]  And then we're supposed to sit here and take it like it's some form of hospitality.
[00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:09.182]  And Trump calls it a travel ban and then people go, oh my gosh, he would get it through.
[00:37:09.182 --> 00:37:13.606]  He didn't call it a travel ban because he's not trying to get things done by lying.
[00:37:13.606 --> 00:37:17.188]  Even the controlled leftist corporate media admits he's telling the truth.
[00:37:17.188 --> 00:37:23.352]  He told the Russian ambassador the Russian investigation was nuts because they all know it's nuts.
[00:37:23.352 --> 00:37:25.294]  He hasn't gotten anything from Russia.
[00:37:25.294 --> 00:37:30.898]  It's totally normal during a transition to be talking to the ambassadors and presidents.
[00:37:30.898 --> 00:37:32.459]  He should have already met with Putin.
[00:37:34.434 --> 00:37:35.440]  But see the optics!
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:36.365]  Oh, Mr. President!
[00:37:36.365 --> 00:37:37.611]  Mr. President, don't do that!
[00:37:37.611 --> 00:37:38.416]  But I told you!
[00:37:40.842 --> 00:37:48.805]  A month ago with Cernovich, we both have our sources that Trump was going to go back to hardcore populist and was going to ignore his advisors and run over them.
[00:37:48.805 --> 00:37:50.185]  And what did you see?
[00:37:50.185 --> 00:37:51.626]  Everything we told you now.
[00:37:51.626 --> 00:37:55.507]  And now CNN and others report that he's turned super populist.
[00:37:55.507 --> 00:37:57.527]  Trump's populist wing on the rise.
[00:37:57.527 --> 00:38:04.890]  And of course, Bannon's in there advising Trump, but only because it clicks with what Trump believes as a blue collar billionaire.
[00:38:05.973 --> 00:38:10.495]  As a guy that came up running big crews, construction crews, you name it.
[00:38:10.495 --> 00:38:12.395]  Liking America.
[00:38:12.395 --> 00:38:13.676]  Tough guy.
[00:38:13.676 --> 00:38:14.296]  Patriot.
[00:38:14.296 --> 00:38:15.456]  Not out to get you.
[00:38:15.456 --> 00:38:17.797]  And Bannon is a blue collar union.
[00:38:17.797 --> 00:38:19.518]  Tough guy too.
[00:38:19.518 --> 00:38:20.458]  Used to be a liberal.
[00:38:20.458 --> 00:38:23.819]  These are real liberals that aren't out to screw the country.
[00:38:23.819 --> 00:38:25.279]  You want to see a real liberal?
[00:38:25.279 --> 00:38:26.380]  Donald John Trump!
[00:38:27.446 --> 00:38:29.708]  Stephen Bannon, those are liberals!
[00:38:29.708 --> 00:38:31.409]  Those are Americans!
[00:38:31.409 --> 00:38:32.350]  I'm a liberal!
[00:38:32.350 --> 00:38:33.591]  I believe in freedom!
[00:38:33.591 --> 00:38:34.892]  I believe in low taxes!
[00:38:34.892 --> 00:38:36.393]  I believe in the right to self-defense!
[00:38:36.393 --> 00:38:39.535]  I believe people should be able to practice the religion they want or not!
[00:38:39.535 --> 00:38:41.697]  And they should be able to have the sexual preference they want!
[00:38:41.697 --> 00:38:43.398]  And they should be able to go to the schools they want!
[00:38:43.398 --> 00:38:46.541]  And they should be left alone and not bullied by political correctness!
[00:38:46.541 --> 00:38:49.183]  And they shouldn't have no white days at campuses!
[00:38:49.183 --> 00:38:51.785]  And whites shouldn't be taught they're inherently evil and bad!
[00:38:54.383 --> 00:39:08.366]  This is the mind warp of the Democratic Party and the sick Hollywood culture that wants to enslave this country and dominate it so bad that it'll do anything, including weaponize culture to destroy flyover country and to destroy the bitter clingers.
[00:39:11.294 --> 00:39:16.917]  And that's what we're coming down to here, and the human species is awake and not backing down.
[00:39:16.917 --> 00:39:27.564]  Ladies and gentlemen of every race, color, and creed, we do all bleed red blood, and we do have one sovereign flag that is the history of our republic, and I call it 1776 worldwide.
[00:39:27.564 --> 00:39:30.365]  And Donald Trump is launching Operation 1776.
[00:39:30.365 --> 00:39:31.066]  That's what all this is.
[00:39:33.953 --> 00:39:41.125]  A lot of people in the government and the CIA and everywhere else go, stuff Jones was saying 15 years ago, word for word, is coming out of Trump's mouth.
[00:39:41.125 --> 00:39:43.850]  Stuff he was saying five years ago, word for word, yes, you guessed it.
[00:39:47.006 --> 00:39:54.369]  Of course the President, and of course Bannon, and of course all those people, and the military, and the generals listen to me.
[00:39:54.369 --> 00:39:55.469]  And do you know why they listen?
[00:39:55.469 --> 00:39:58.350]  Because they already know everything I know and more.
[00:39:58.350 --> 00:40:02.292]  This is just one of the only radio shows that actually is in reality.
[00:40:02.292 --> 00:40:03.893]  They don't get their info from me.
[00:40:05.657 --> 00:40:09.898]  They're on the same page, because we're bringing back America.
[00:40:09.898 --> 00:40:11.858]  We want the Republic to be strong.
[00:40:11.858 --> 00:40:13.419]  We want prosperity.
[00:40:13.419 --> 00:40:14.379]  We want 1950 2.0.
[00:40:14.379 --> 00:40:18.220]  People go, oh, you want to go back?
[00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:25.862]  No, 1950 was when we were science, and we could do anything, and we were going to end the discrimination in America, and we were going to come together.
[00:40:25.862 --> 00:40:30.223]  Because we just won World War II, and darn it, we weren't like those Nazis.
[00:40:30.703 --> 00:40:32.684]  And the Democrats were scared.
[00:40:32.684 --> 00:40:34.324]  The KKK wasn't popular anymore.
[00:40:34.324 --> 00:40:37.265]  They didn't know what to do, so they became the anti-racist.
[00:40:37.265 --> 00:40:41.726]  And you see them using their same tricks today, whether it's Nancy Pelosi or Maxine Waters.
[00:40:41.726 --> 00:40:51.949]  These are conscious, evil, race-pimp, horrible people who hate everybody and are using divide and conquer when Donald Trump is unifying the people and having them come together.
[00:40:53.246 --> 00:41:14.456]  Now, unifying America, not unifying us with the UN, and global government, and TPP, and IMF, and World Bank, and all these things we never got a vote in, and to watch the corporate media sit there dumbfounded when he had that speech recently, pulling out of the Paris Accords, when he told it like it was, to the whole world.
[00:41:16.212 --> 00:41:19.393]  And said, I represent Pittsburgh, not Paris.
[00:41:19.393 --> 00:41:20.734]  And this is a screw job.
[00:41:20.734 --> 00:41:22.734]  And here's how the taxes affect us.
[00:41:22.734 --> 00:41:28.897]  And it's designed to shut us down economically and to pick winners and losers by a corporate elite.
[00:41:28.897 --> 00:41:32.758]  That was high noon to Count Dracula.
[00:41:32.758 --> 00:41:34.439]  That was like dragging his
[00:41:35.666 --> 00:41:46.352]  Coffin out in the middle of a big field on the 4th of July and just opening that coffin up and Count Dracula is burning up right now.
[00:41:46.352 --> 00:41:52.415]  George Soros, the New World Order, their whole big plan, their whole technocracy is dying.
[00:41:52.415 --> 00:41:58.959]  The American people and the Brexit, everybody else have already literally driven two foot
[00:41:59.910 --> 00:42:06.953]  Short sword, double-edged daggers, up through the sternum, into the heart, and are just sloshing around the liver, kidneys, and everything else.
[00:42:06.953 --> 00:42:12.015]  And we just pull the knife out and the globalists are stumbling off, bleeding to death, and they know it.
[00:42:12.015 --> 00:42:24.800]  The most important thing politically to understand, though, is while they die, while the giant squid dies, let's make sure it can't get its tentacles wrapped around us and drag us to the bottom.
[00:42:27.605 --> 00:42:28.785]  So don't ever give up.
[00:42:28.785 --> 00:42:32.867]  All the giant squids rolling around bleeding to death, we're the equivalent of sperm whales.
[00:42:32.867 --> 00:42:35.828]  We gotta turn in and go over and get another big bite in.
[00:42:35.828 --> 00:42:37.108]  Another big bite in.
[00:42:37.108 --> 00:42:56.094]  And make sure they know, we know you're the enemy, we know you hate America, we know you're a bunch of alpha psychopaths that think you're better than us, and that think you'll dominate us, and just like the communists, and just like the fascists, and just like the redcoats, America is coming back and is gonna kick your butt politically, so get ready.
[00:42:57.114 --> 00:43:00.416]  The trance you've had over humanity is over.
[00:43:00.416 --> 00:43:03.518]  So get ready.
[00:43:03.518 --> 00:43:07.621]  Nationalism, free market is the winning team.
[00:43:07.621 --> 00:43:10.563]  Always has been, always will be.
[00:43:10.563 --> 00:43:15.746]  The Renaissance 550 years old, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:43:15.746 --> 00:43:22.431]  And it's about to go into full bloom and we're about to see the greatest innovations and the secrets of the universe unlocked.
[00:43:23.598 --> 00:43:25.579]  And the globalists don't want that.
[00:43:25.579 --> 00:43:49.407]  They want the universities busy turning the youth into basket cases that are mentally ill and all fighting with each other so that you're so screwed up and such a chip-on-the-shoulder neurotic that by the time you get three degrees and you're $150,000 in debt, and you realize you'll never get out of debt because just the financing of it will be another $100,000, you're so politically scrambled in a cult, you don't know what hit you.
[00:43:52.799 --> 00:43:55.760]  And that's what this is all about.
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:59.200]  And it's going to get worse.
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:05.561]  It's going to get worse, and it's going to get worse, and worse, and worse, because of your big foreign banks that have hijacked the country.
[00:44:05.561 --> 00:44:07.122]  All you can do is create, divide, and conquer.
[00:44:07.122 --> 00:44:12.683]  It's called the Great Game, what British intelligence used to control India with only 10,000 men.
[00:44:12.683 --> 00:44:18.824]  They could control tens of millions of people by creating tribal animosity and divide and conquer.
[00:44:18.824 --> 00:44:20.684]  And they created sociology
[00:44:23.049 --> 00:44:41.392]  To go into India and other areas with the first vanguard, doctors normally, and missionaries, and then they would go in and track all the divisions, write it up, and then come back in within another 10, 15, 20 years and then start the civil wars.
[00:44:42.799 --> 00:44:56.363]  And so you got all these dirtbags like Gruber who sits up there on C-SPAN with a bunch of other professors going, and they're all like fawning after him, he goes, I know how to scam Americans, they're so stupid, they have no attention spans, we're gonna double and triple their prices, and I was chosen to come up with the lies.
[00:44:56.363 --> 00:45:10.208]  I am the great, and they're just like, oh, he's just so proud, just, I'm the big liar, I say it on TV, and all the big leftists are like, oh God, you're helping bring down America, you are so incredible, he's like, I know I am, oh, I'm so incredible, and he's just sitting there, just on a total power trip.
[00:45:11.517 --> 00:45:13.239]  And that's what they go to college for.
[00:45:13.239 --> 00:45:14.560]  That's the upper crust, though.
[00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:22.606]  You go knowing you're a sociopath or a psychopath, knowing you're going to prey on everyone, and then you try to get into the upper graduate areas so you can actually fawn after the elites.
[00:45:22.606 --> 00:45:24.508]  And will you teach me how to be a good liar?
[00:45:24.508 --> 00:45:27.851]  And then can I work for you and help oppress the people and suck off of them?
[00:45:28.291 --> 00:45:29.572]  And they all cackle and laugh.
[00:45:29.572 --> 00:45:30.672]  Read the WikiLeaks.
[00:45:30.672 --> 00:45:33.893]  They're like, top Democrats are saying, we're losing this war.
[00:45:33.893 --> 00:45:36.274]  We're trying to keep them in the dark and helpless as best we can.
[00:45:36.274 --> 00:45:37.075]  These are quotes.
[00:45:37.075 --> 00:45:38.975]  We're trying to keep them in the dark and helpless.
[00:45:38.975 --> 00:45:39.776]  It's not working.
[00:45:39.776 --> 00:45:41.656]  Now, they're not listening to us.
[00:45:41.656 --> 00:45:42.937]  They're still not moving against us.
[00:45:42.937 --> 00:45:44.738]  But if they start moving against us, we're going to lose.
[00:45:44.738 --> 00:45:45.898]  The answer is culture war.
[00:45:45.898 --> 00:45:48.059]  We've got to intensify it.
[00:45:48.059 --> 00:45:52.721]  And that's what all this is.
[00:45:52.721 --> 00:45:55.262]  So when you understand, you see one of these fake liberals,
[00:45:56.371 --> 00:46:07.762]  These are sociopaths who are beta males who want to be in dominant positions but don't want to create economies, don't want responsibility, don't want prosperity.
[00:46:07.762 --> 00:46:11.305]  They want to see everybody else fail so they feel big.
[00:46:11.305 --> 00:46:19.493]  So you get consortiums of beta males together with also control freak cryptic women and they build these alliances with psychology and all the rest of it.
[00:46:21.004 --> 00:46:24.012]  To create an unaware... Oh yeah, they found another one.
[00:46:24.012 --> 00:46:24.914]  I forgot this one.
[00:46:24.914 --> 00:46:27.561]  The unaware and compliant and ignorant.
[00:46:27.561 --> 00:46:28.624]  Yes, that's another one of them.
[00:46:30.932 --> 00:46:32.752]  Oh, you're so smart!
[00:46:32.752 --> 00:46:41.177]  Oh my gosh, you put the wrong, you know, you told women don't breastfeed and then put out for generations formula combinations you knew would reduce IQ 30 points.
[00:46:41.177 --> 00:46:43.498]  Oh, you're such, you're so advanced!
[00:46:43.498 --> 00:46:59.227]  You created billions of quasi-retarded people to rule over everyone so you could be so powerful and then get a bunch of mercenary TV crews to run around and point at somebody who's actually virile and alive and primitive and is aware of what they're doing and is exposing it!
[00:46:59.887 --> 00:47:03.108]  So they can make all their jokes all day and have their Buckford characters and the rest of it.
[00:47:03.108 --> 00:47:04.168]  But you know what?
[00:47:04.168 --> 00:47:09.709]  I am primitively reaching out to people in an emergency warning saying, you are under attack.
[00:47:09.709 --> 00:47:10.670]  We are under attack.
[00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:12.830]  These are con artists that are running your life.
[00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:15.771]  And if you go along with them, you have conned yourself.
[00:47:15.771 --> 00:47:17.951]  And when you give in to them, you have conned yourself.
[00:47:17.951 --> 00:47:18.871]  Come out of the trance.
[00:47:18.871 --> 00:47:20.392]  You don't have to believe what I believe.
[00:47:20.392 --> 00:47:21.712]  You don't have to follow what I follow.
[00:47:21.712 --> 00:47:28.394]  You just have to know you've been lied to and take the blinders off.
[00:47:28.394 --> 00:47:29.334]  And that's all I'm asking.
[00:47:30.609 --> 00:47:33.871]  That's all I'm asking!
[00:47:33.871 --> 00:47:35.232]  I got a bunch of clips I want to get to.
[00:47:35.232 --> 00:47:39.915]  A ton of stuff I want to break down.
[00:47:39.915 --> 00:47:41.896]  Hillary, though, just said, don't worry about a jihad attack.
[00:47:41.896 --> 00:47:50.701]  If a guy screams, comes into your pub, screaming Allah Akbar with, you know, a two-foot knife, three guys come in and start stabbing women in front of you.
[00:47:50.701 --> 00:47:52.142]  Imagine!
[00:47:52.142 --> 00:47:53.223]  I've got the full reports here.
[00:47:54.264 --> 00:47:58.528]  The Islamists always target the weakest, and they got a thing about hating women.
[00:47:58.528 --> 00:48:04.495]  And so, I guess they figure they can kill more because they won't resist as much, and they just start stabbing them right in the eyes, and right in the throat.
[00:48:05.646 --> 00:48:10.009]  And the men report they would just stand there while he would stab each woman ten times.
[00:48:10.009 --> 00:48:11.210]  I'm loving, I'm liberal!
[00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:12.451]  This is for Allah!
[00:48:12.451 --> 00:48:14.472]  This is for Allah!
[00:48:14.472 --> 00:48:27.602]  And the men are all sitting there and one guy out of over a hundred in this pub, the blue and white pub, who's a hooligan, a bad man, he still goes to soccer games, some vestigial male thing, and still gets in fights sometimes.
[00:48:27.602 --> 00:48:28.683]  Oh my God!
[00:48:28.683 --> 00:48:32.085]  It's men like this that got us here standing up against garbage like this.
[00:48:32.085 --> 00:48:33.966]  He stands up, takes them on, the lion
[00:48:34.787 --> 00:48:38.470]  of London Bridge, and they're talking about maybe charging him now.
[00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:41.371]  You know, it's like the guy that had the gypsies robbing him, and he shot him.
[00:48:41.371 --> 00:48:42.272]  They robbed him the third time.
[00:48:42.272 --> 00:48:43.973]  He spent like, what was it, 10 years in prison?
[00:48:43.973 --> 00:48:45.194]  I'm going from memory.
[00:48:45.194 --> 00:48:51.398]  And so this guy stands up and says, F you, shouts the name of his soccer team.
[00:48:51.398 --> 00:48:52.179]  It wasn't England.
[00:48:52.179 --> 00:48:53.299]  It wasn't Western culture.
[00:48:53.299 --> 00:48:54.360]  It wasn't Renaissance.
[00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:56.662]  But at least he had something he had allegiance to.
[00:48:56.662 --> 00:48:57.862]  At least he was willing to stand up.
[00:48:57.862 --> 00:48:59.644]  This was his pub, his people.
[00:48:59.644 --> 00:49:04.247]  He just watched them stab a bunch of people, and they're talking about how incredible, what a lion he is.
[00:49:05.508 --> 00:49:07.249]  I mean, let me tell you, I want to survive.
[00:49:07.249 --> 00:49:09.491]  Three guys pop in here with knives, man.
[00:49:09.491 --> 00:49:10.793]  I'm going to overturn this.
[00:49:10.793 --> 00:49:11.834]  I'm going to grab this bottle.
[00:49:11.834 --> 00:49:16.998]  Of course, I'm here in the United States, and my forebears made sure I had the Second Amendment.
[00:49:16.998 --> 00:49:18.700]  I fought for it, and I've got my concealed carry.
[00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:19.341]  So, oh, guess what?
[00:49:19.341 --> 00:49:24.085]  If jihadis bust in here, they're going to have to face my 9mm.
[00:49:24.085 --> 00:49:30.291]  But see, imagine, see, this guy that fought them, a hundred people stood there and just watched as they stabbed women.
[00:49:31.451 --> 00:49:32.312]  He's the weirdo.
[00:49:32.312 --> 00:49:33.412]  He's the bad guy.
[00:49:33.412 --> 00:49:35.674]  I'm the weirdo because I've got a firearm.
[00:49:35.674 --> 00:49:40.717]  The government can have big armored bases and command bases and nuclear weapons and take my tax money to have it.
[00:49:40.717 --> 00:49:43.678]  But if I've got a firearm, see, it's scary, isn't it?
[00:49:43.678 --> 00:49:46.980]  And it was so scary when I was growing up.
[00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:53.024]  You know, if some gang member four years older than me, when I'm like 12, starts beating me up,
[00:49:54.198 --> 00:50:02.421]  And so I pick a brick up and smash it over their head and the police get there and they go, well, the people said they saw he attacked you, but you know, this guy's, this guy's in a coma.
[00:50:02.421 --> 00:50:04.002]  We're going to have to take you to juvenile.
[00:50:04.002 --> 00:50:05.002]  See, it was still bad.
[00:50:05.002 --> 00:50:06.323]  It was still bad.
[00:50:06.323 --> 00:50:10.944]  You've got a 12 year old beating his head in the ground and you're like 16, 17 years old trying to kill me.
[00:50:10.944 --> 00:50:12.205]  And I fought back.
[00:50:12.205 --> 00:50:13.765]  I'm the bad man.
[00:50:13.765 --> 00:50:15.066]  I'm the evil man.
[00:50:15.066 --> 00:50:16.406]  I never attacked anybody.
[00:50:16.406 --> 00:50:17.307]  Didn't attack me first.
[00:50:18.007 --> 00:50:20.088]  But see, I'm the ultimate evil, you see.
[00:50:20.088 --> 00:50:24.569]  Because the sociopaths and the psychopaths, they don't like anybody standing up.
[00:50:24.569 --> 00:50:38.694]  That's why they've got their filthy, degenerate, stinking nanny state.
[00:50:38.694 --> 00:50:39.394]  I'm gonna skip this break.
[00:50:43.305 --> 00:50:47.946]  You know, I would have gotten this wound up today even if Megyn Kelly hadn't been here.
[00:50:47.946 --> 00:50:59.228]  I haven't gotten wound up in a while as much because I just, I just, it's, it's, I try to just, I try to realize what the social engineers are doing and just deal with it intellectually and take care of it.
[00:50:59.228 --> 00:51:03.449]  But I understand, I need to be real with people at a primitive level.
[00:51:03.449 --> 00:51:04.570]  People ask, am I fake?
[00:51:04.570 --> 00:51:06.550]  Am I an actor?
[00:51:06.550 --> 00:51:08.570]  I've been in movies.
[00:51:08.570 --> 00:51:10.911]  I can be an actor, but I've always played parts
[00:51:12.247 --> 00:51:17.750]  That were what I already believed.
[00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:18.130]  Understand?
[00:51:18.130 --> 00:51:22.572]  It's like saying, are you an actor when you go up to a pretty woman and try to be charming?
[00:51:22.572 --> 00:51:25.394]  No, you're being yourself.
[00:51:25.394 --> 00:51:26.634]  But it's the same thing.
[00:51:26.634 --> 00:51:28.175]  I'm angry about the Islamic attacks.
[00:51:28.175 --> 00:51:30.676]  I'm angry about the apologies for it.
[00:51:30.676 --> 00:51:33.478]  I'm genuinely pissed off.
[00:51:33.478 --> 00:51:36.479]  And then I let myself be that way on air.
[00:51:36.479 --> 00:51:38.981]  But I'm in control of myself.
[00:51:38.981 --> 00:51:39.501]  Most of the time.
[00:51:40.817 --> 00:51:50.641]  All I'm saying is, I'm letting people at least see verbally what people were like in the past if there was a threat going on.
[00:51:50.641 --> 00:51:54.102]  I mean, if you went back a thousand years ago and you're in some valley,
[00:51:55.216 --> 00:52:13.186]  Let's say in Europe or wherever it is in the world, or Asia, it didn't matter, and somebody had come through the valley that day, marauders, and grabbed your wife and daughters and some of your kids and run off with them, you'd go give a speech like that to the men in the village, saying, I know that tribe over the hill might be bigger than us, but if we don't stand up, they're never going to stop coming and kidnapping our family.
[00:52:13.186 --> 00:52:17.349]  Let's get our weapons and let's go get our family back.
[00:52:17.349 --> 00:52:19.590]  And guarantee the speeches were just like the one you just heard.
[00:52:21.786 --> 00:52:23.710]  And that's what a leader is.
[00:52:23.710 --> 00:52:27.017]  And I have politically done everything I can in the information war.
[00:52:28.581 --> 00:52:49.405]  In the last 20 years to wake up as many people to the anti-American, anti-woman, anti-family, anti-human, anti-God, anti-everything, global authoritarian system that is using Islam and socialism and communism and all these failed systems on purpose to screw up society and consolidate control.
[00:52:49.405 --> 00:52:56.566]  And we've even got all the WikiLeaks where they admit they're in a race to make you poor, to control you, that they use poverty as a weapon.
[00:52:58.107 --> 00:53:04.130]  Of course globalists can't compete with free market, and they want monopoly, so that's why they're attacking it.
[00:53:04.130 --> 00:53:22.940]  And we've got terror attacks now in Paris, we've got people taken hostage in Australia, just today in Ramadan, and they just say, nothing to do with Islam, nothing to do with Islam, nothing to do with Islam, like they're going to tame us in the West to go along with it, and like the social engineers are going to tame the Islamists and make them be nice.
[00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:24.961]  That's the useful idiots at the university level.
[00:53:25.481 --> 00:53:27.122]  Or at the local newscaster level.
[00:53:27.122 --> 00:53:43.296]  Let me assure you, at the Pentagon level, and at the CIA level, and at the Zbigniew Brzezinski level, who just died a week ago or two weeks ago, at the Zbigniew Brzezinski level, they wrote books explaining they're using Islam as the global destabilization force to bring in a world government.
[00:53:43.296 --> 00:53:48.301]  And when they're done with it, they're going to wipe out large portions of the Muslim population.
[00:53:51.869 --> 00:53:56.411]  Let's go ahead and play a clip that deals with this, with a former Islamist warning the world.
[00:53:56.411 --> 00:53:58.872]  Former Islamic extremist, Majid Nawaz.
[00:53:58.872 --> 00:54:00.632]  Majid, thank you for being here tonight.
[00:54:00.632 --> 00:54:02.093]  It's good to have you with us this evening.
[00:54:02.093 --> 00:54:10.316]  You know, you listen to that list and we played the soundbite from our last conversation back in March when you warned that there would be much more to come.
[00:54:10.316 --> 00:54:13.817]  I suppose you're sorry you were right.
[00:54:13.817 --> 00:54:17.639]  Indeed, and I think we have to come to terms, Martha, with the fact that Europe
[00:54:18.337 --> 00:54:23.399]  Britain and the rest of Europe are in the midst of a full-blown jihadist insurgency.
[00:54:23.399 --> 00:54:32.424]  You were citing figures earlier that our security services are attempting to monitor around 23,000 suspected jihadists.
[00:54:32.424 --> 00:54:41.728]  That, by the way, is out of a population in the UK of just 5% that are Muslim, which means that 23,000 from 4 million Muslims in this country
[00:54:42.128 --> 00:54:44.910]  Yes, this is a military insurgency in Europe, in the UK, and the answer is bring more in.
[00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:46.310]  What do you think was going to happen when
[00:55:08.550 --> 00:55:17.074]  The UN, NATO, The Globalist, seven, eight years ago with Google, with Obama, this has all been in the news.
[00:55:17.074 --> 00:55:25.619]  Met up in Watford at that five-star hotel, we went and covered it, and organized publicly the Arab Spring, and then launched it with Anderson Cooper going, look how liberal it is!
[00:55:25.619 --> 00:55:32.662]  They were blowing up and burning every church they could get a hold of in Egypt, and overthrowing our allies.
[00:55:32.662 --> 00:55:36.284]  And I sat there and watched, CIA, Anderson Cooper, Robert Barron Eyre,
[00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:41.701]  Gay.
[00:55:41.701 --> 00:55:48.243]  Promoting the Arab Spring in Egypt while they were throwing gays off buildings every hour.
[00:55:48.243 --> 00:55:49.904]  Conservatively.
[00:55:49.904 --> 00:55:51.764]  In some cases blocks from where he is.
[00:55:51.764 --> 00:55:58.467]  I mean, imagine the sellout, weird, twisted nature of that.
[00:55:58.467 --> 00:56:00.687]  Of a robber baron.
[00:56:00.687 --> 00:56:02.928]  Toady.
[00:56:02.928 --> 00:56:06.129]  Now I'm gonna go to break here and we've got a bunch of guys coming up.
[00:56:06.129 --> 00:56:07.590]  And a ton of clips I haven't even gotten to yet.
[00:56:09.073 --> 00:56:15.097]  I'm going to get settled down now and more focused here.
[00:56:15.097 --> 00:56:18.339]  But I do just want to ask the listeners to spread the word about Infowars.com.
[00:56:18.339 --> 00:56:21.701]  I want you to spread the videos, the articles, because they're doing everything they can to stop it.
[00:56:21.701 --> 00:56:22.502]  They want to censor us.
[00:56:22.502 --> 00:56:23.802]  They admit they are.
[00:56:23.802 --> 00:56:26.264]  You are destroying the controlled fake press.
[00:56:26.264 --> 00:56:29.566]  You are destroying the corporate media.
[00:56:29.566 --> 00:56:30.827]  You are annihilating them.
[00:56:34.209 --> 00:56:41.876]  They've been somewhat energized in their death battle with Trump and America and nationalism, but that's a dead cat bounce.
[00:56:41.876 --> 00:56:43.918]  That's their death battle.
[00:56:43.918 --> 00:56:46.320]  We just get stronger as their ideology is exposed.
[00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:51.224]  We have come light years exposing the unelected nature of world government.
[00:56:51.224 --> 00:56:52.485]  That's why it's more important than ever.
[00:56:53.510 --> 00:57:08.073]  That everyone support InfoWars by going to InfoWarsStore.com and circumventing the establishment so that they can't get our sponsors, and buying the highest quality, private-labeled, many of our items are private-labeled, top best-selling brands.
[00:57:08.073 --> 00:57:09.253]  They're at Whole Foods, you name it.
[00:57:09.253 --> 00:57:17.255]  We just go get the very best organic, top certified companies around 30, 40 years, and then we have it private-labeled, and we have 25% off on average.
[00:57:17.255 --> 00:57:17.655]  That's what we do.
[00:57:18.968 --> 00:57:20.910]  We also sell the Emmerich's Essentials line.
[00:57:20.910 --> 00:57:23.132]  It's one of the top companies in the United States.
[00:57:23.132 --> 00:57:26.175]  They let us private label it.
[00:57:26.175 --> 00:57:31.880]  That's why you'll recognize the packaging and it's 20% off retail with 25% off at auto ship.
[00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:36.885]  That is the third largest brand in Whole Foods we now private label.
[00:57:36.885 --> 00:57:41.850]  Just an example, they'll probably call it snake poo or snake screen because anything we sell
[00:57:42.935 --> 00:57:47.398]  It could be, you know, a bottle opener or a book or a t-shirt.
[00:57:47.398 --> 00:57:50.620]  It's just evil because you aren't allowed to have your own funding.
[00:57:50.620 --> 00:58:03.848]  And if other people ever figure out in media having their own funding with their audiences, it's over for the globalists who know that they're propping up MSM and that know that, you know, Archer Daniels Midland and Lockheed have ads on mainstream news.
[00:58:03.848 --> 00:58:09.631]  No one's buying, you know, fighter bombers for a billion and a half dollars, you know, who's watching that.
[00:58:09.631 --> 00:58:12.133]  It's just part of their tithe to mainstream news.
[00:58:13.174 --> 00:58:15.576]  Well, tithe here and get high quality products.
[00:58:15.576 --> 00:58:19.858]  Selenium is electrochemical in the body, just like vitamin C or iodine.
[00:58:19.858 --> 00:58:21.359]  If you don't have it, you'll die.
[00:58:21.359 --> 00:58:24.502]  And this is the purest form from mustard seed.
[00:58:24.502 --> 00:58:30.065]  Bio selenium sold out for months because we get the absolutely clean California level clean standards.
[00:58:30.065 --> 00:58:31.867]  It's hard to get it at that level.
[00:58:31.867 --> 00:58:35.009]  700 plus reviews, 4.8 stars on Power Reviews.
[00:58:35.009 --> 00:58:36.209]  Nobody's got that.
[00:58:36.209 --> 00:58:40.832]  It's back in stock, 25% off and other specials at InfoWarsTore.com or AAA2533139.
[00:58:43.315 --> 00:58:45.142]  But most importantly, pray for us.
[00:58:45.142 --> 00:58:46.106]  Tell folks to tune in.
[00:58:46.106 --> 00:58:46.507]  Hour number two.
[00:58:52.495 --> 00:58:59.981]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[00:58:59.981 --> 00:59:13.190]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[00:59:14.131 --> 00:59:26.026]  Biome Defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[00:59:26.026 --> 00:59:31.993]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.
[00:59:32.734 --> 00:59:41.739]  Secure your biome defense in ultra strength or regular strength at InfoWarsLife.com today and get started supporting your digestive system naturally.
[00:59:41.739 --> 00:59:54.905]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first run to the public, so please take advantage of it today, support your own health, and support the InfoWar.
[00:59:54.905 --> 00:59:57.527]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:08.371 --> 01:00:11.993]  I'm going to destroy Colbert in the next segment.
[01:00:11.993 --> 01:00:14.674]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:14.674 --> 01:00:19.397]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[01:00:19.397 --> 01:00:26.881]  I'm going to go to Colbert and his sickening attacks on the president and how he preys on his servile audience.
[01:00:28.209 --> 01:00:34.934]  Then we're going to get Tommy Robinson on, who's exposing the whole jihad invasion that's taking place.
[01:00:34.934 --> 01:00:45.181]  We've got so much more, but first, with all the new terror attacks happening today from Australia to Paris, France, here is a clip from Tommy Robinson, UK government housing radical jihadists on your streets.
[01:00:45.181 --> 01:00:50.185]  The aim of these videos is to radicalize people.
[01:00:50.185 --> 01:00:50.946]  It's to brainwash people.
[01:00:50.946 --> 01:00:52.707]  It's to clean their brain of the filth of the kuffar.
[01:00:56.297 --> 01:01:02.859]  So, what we have is, five doors down here, the government of Howes, one of the country's most extreme radical Muslims.
[01:01:02.859 --> 01:01:10.321]  The acts that the homosexuals do, that act is something that other persons, anyone that gets caught doing that act, they will be punished.
[01:01:10.321 --> 01:01:11.241]  And what's the punishment?
[01:01:11.241 --> 01:01:13.842]  Well, one of them is obviously chucking them on five wheelers.
[01:01:15.782 --> 01:01:17.403]  We just said throw people off buildings.
[01:01:17.403 --> 01:01:26.369]  He's that extreme and that much of a potential jihadist and terrorist that the government seized his passport to stop him going to fight for ISIS in Syria.
[01:01:26.369 --> 01:01:31.612]  Now, they seem more concerned about people in Syria getting hurt than they do about English people.
[01:01:31.612 --> 01:01:34.754]  Because if you have a look here, look where they've housed him.
[01:01:34.754 --> 01:01:36.615]  That's a primary school.
[01:01:36.615 --> 01:01:42.719]  They've housed one of the country's worst and potential jihadists, five doors from a children's primary school.
[01:01:42.719 --> 01:01:42.859]  Now,
[01:01:43.973 --> 01:01:45.354]  I don't know how much.
[01:01:45.354 --> 01:01:52.058]  Theresa May, or I keep hearing Amber Rudd, you keep saying, we're all going to be alright, everything's going to be alright, get back to normal, life as normal.
[01:01:52.058 --> 01:01:52.879]  What do you mean life as normal?
[01:01:52.879 --> 01:01:54.440]  There's dead kids in Manchester.
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:59.763]  You're housing terrorists next to a children's... You're housing terrorist supporters next to a children's school.
[01:01:59.763 --> 01:02:00.524]  Not your children!
[01:02:01.345 --> 01:02:02.786]  They don't cross paths with you.
[01:02:02.786 --> 01:02:04.087]  You drive around in bulletproof cars.
[01:02:04.087 --> 01:02:05.208]  Okay?
[01:02:05.208 --> 01:02:06.508]  They're our children.
[01:02:06.508 --> 01:02:07.189]  They're our kids.
[01:02:07.189 --> 01:02:08.330]  They're our families.
[01:02:08.330 --> 01:02:11.071]  And you think you can just put them at risk like this?
[01:02:11.071 --> 01:02:11.712]  The potential risk?
[01:02:11.712 --> 01:02:18.076]  What we find with every terrorist attack, we find that the man that's committed it was known to MI5.
[01:02:18.076 --> 01:02:19.617]  They were watching him at some point.
[01:02:19.617 --> 01:02:20.438]  Just like this man is.
[01:02:21.198 --> 01:02:24.800]  This man is one of 3,000 who are monitored 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:31.165]  We have another 20,000 would-be jihadists in our country that we simply can't afford to monitor all the time.
[01:02:31.165 --> 01:02:32.826]  But this is one of the worst.
[01:02:32.826 --> 01:02:34.607]  He has a police guard outside his house.
[01:02:34.607 --> 01:02:35.988]  He has cameras, okay?
[01:02:35.988 --> 01:02:39.450]  That's only come for the last day because they're aware that I'm trying to track him down.
[01:02:39.450 --> 01:02:40.931]  Usually there's no police guard there.
[01:02:40.931 --> 01:02:45.615]  How easy would it be for him to walk out of there with a knife and target them kids?
[01:02:45.615 --> 01:02:46.675]  How easy is that?
[01:02:46.675 --> 01:02:47.496]  You think you can stop that?
[01:02:52.674 --> 01:02:59.641]  If you're a parent, if you're a parent and your children go to this school, how do you feel about the risk that they've been put at?
[01:02:59.641 --> 01:03:02.684]  The potential risk that's just there, just there.
[01:03:02.684 --> 01:03:04.406]  The potential risk.
[01:03:04.406 --> 01:03:09.651]  And to our government, if you're going to continue to think you can hide these men, we're going to find them.
[01:03:09.651 --> 01:03:11.112]  We're going to find them because
[01:03:12.028 --> 01:03:15.370]  The general public need to be aware of the fray.
[01:03:15.370 --> 01:03:17.030]  They need to be aware of the risk.
[01:03:17.030 --> 01:03:20.392]  If you've got kids in that school, you deserve to know how extreme that man is.
[01:03:20.392 --> 01:03:20.852]  That's right.
[01:03:20.852 --> 01:03:21.933]  It's beyond a sex offender.
[01:03:21.933 --> 01:03:24.114]  If we look at how big our problem is... That's dangerous.
[01:03:24.114 --> 01:03:27.555]  We have 3,000 Muslims on 24-hour day, 7-day-a-week watch.
[01:03:27.555 --> 01:03:31.077]  But up to 20,000 more radicals that we simply don't have the resources to watch.
[01:03:31.978 --> 01:03:34.381]  Up to 23, 25,000 people, okay?
[01:03:34.381 --> 01:03:40.750]  Even if we wanted to raid them and arrest them and bring them all in, that would take hundreds of thousands of police officers.
[01:03:40.750 --> 01:03:43.734]  It would take months and months and months.
[01:03:43.734 --> 01:03:45.836]  That's how bad the problem is now.
[01:03:45.836 --> 01:03:45.997]  Now!
[01:03:47.227 --> 01:03:49.089]  You wouldn't house a paedophile next to a school.
[01:03:49.089 --> 01:03:50.930]  Don't house a terrorist supporter.
[01:03:50.930 --> 01:03:58.998]  With what we've seen now, with the attacks we've seen, what our government should have been doing, what we should have been hearing from you on our news, is that you're rounding up every ISIS supporter.
[01:03:58.998 --> 01:04:00.639]  You're rounding them up and interning them.
[01:04:00.639 --> 01:04:02.621]  You're getting them off our streets.
[01:04:02.621 --> 01:04:04.503]  Not walking, crossing paths with us.
[01:04:04.503 --> 01:04:06.445]  Whose mum wants to queue up and live next door to these men?
[01:04:06.445 --> 01:04:07.866]  We have to live next door to them, it's not right!
[01:04:12.535 --> 01:04:16.476]  I don't know how much more you think as a government English men are going to tolerate.
[01:04:16.476 --> 01:04:20.077]  When their children are being blown up, it sort of steps it up to a next level.
[01:04:20.077 --> 01:04:23.098]  At some point in the future, you're going to create a monster.
[01:04:23.098 --> 01:04:26.199]  You're going to create a monster because you need to intern these men.
[01:04:26.199 --> 01:04:28.260]  You need to take them off our streets.
[01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:30.461]  You need to protect our people.
[01:04:30.461 --> 01:04:33.302]  You need to protect our children, which you're failing at.
[01:04:33.962 --> 01:04:34.803]  You're failing them.
[01:04:34.803 --> 01:04:43.368]  And when people can no longer rely on the police, when they can no longer rely on the government or the system, people will endeavor to seek their own justice.
[01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:12.070]  You might think the best ways to stop terrorism is maybe extreme vetting, not allowing unvetted refugees into your home, maybe not trying to do so many regime changes in Middle Eastern countries.
[01:05:12.070 --> 01:05:13.451]  Love, you're all wrong.
[01:05:13.451 --> 01:05:18.856]  In fact, Hillary Clinton says a way to stop terrorism is to understand other cultures and their food.
[01:05:18.856 --> 01:05:19.317]  Yes, really.
[01:05:19.437 --> 01:05:30.185]  She also defended London Mayor Siti Khan, the man who once represented 9-11 Al-Qaeda member Zacharias Moussaoui, called moderate Muslims Uncle Toms, and said terrorism was part and parcel to living in a major city.
[01:05:30.185 --> 01:05:32.847]  And she added, Khan has shown steady, determined leadership.
[01:05:32.847 --> 01:05:35.549]  Hillary said the best way to combating terror is to reach out to the world.
[01:05:35.649 --> 01:05:37.830]  In order to understand people living in foreign countries.
[01:05:37.830 --> 01:05:38.831]  Getting to know one another.
[01:05:38.831 --> 01:05:42.833]  Learning about the experiences, the lives, the cultures, the religions, the food.
[01:05:42.833 --> 01:05:47.276]  So does this mean we gotta be like into stoning women, cutting off their genitals, and throwing gays off buildings?
[01:05:47.276 --> 01:05:52.299]  This is not a time to lash out, to incite fear, to use tragedy and terror for political gain, said Clinton.
[01:05:52.299 --> 01:05:53.940]  A comment obviously aimed at Donald Trump.
[01:05:53.940 --> 01:06:00.044]  And anyone else who has correctly identified political correctness and tolerance of Islam as creating a fertile ground for terrorist attacks in the Western world.
[01:06:00.044 --> 01:06:02.906]  Rob Dewey reporting for InfoWars Nightly News and InfoWars.com.
[01:06:03.366 --> 01:06:08.828]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:06:08.828 --> 01:06:10.908]  Research across the board is clear.
[01:06:10.908 --> 01:06:16.210]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[01:06:16.210 --> 01:06:19.971]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that
[01:06:20.071 --> 01:06:23.494]  Your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[01:06:23.494 --> 01:06:26.676]  Super Blue Fluoride-Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[01:06:26.676 --> 01:06:30.559]  It's loaded with good halogen iodide instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[01:06:30.559 --> 01:06:37.724]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[01:06:37.724 --> 01:06:43.128]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil,
[01:06:43.388 --> 01:06:45.430]  Iodine, nano, silver, and more.
[01:06:45.430 --> 01:06:53.738]  Due to requests from listeners who found that Spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children, we have created the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue that is Spearmint free.
[01:06:53.738 --> 01:07:02.026]  Learn more about the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue toothpaste and more at InfoWarsLife.com and support the InfoWars while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[01:07:03.078 --> 01:07:07.083]  A new shipment of Bio-True Selenium is now available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:07:07.083 --> 01:07:08.565]  We've been sold out for months.
[01:07:08.565 --> 01:07:13.632]  Our one-of-a-kind InfoWars Life Bio-True Selenium formula is now back in stock at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:07:13.632 --> 01:07:17.638]  This is the true selenium formula that has rocked the nutraceutical industry to its core.
[01:07:18.158 --> 01:07:22.281]  Every other selenium supplement on the market is produced with synthetic selenium.
[01:07:22.281 --> 01:07:27.444]  But bio-true selenium is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[01:07:27.444 --> 01:07:30.906]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are well known.
[01:07:30.906 --> 01:07:34.929]  From supporting the thyroid gland and immune system to DNA production and eyesight.
[01:07:35.069 --> 01:07:43.151]  BioTruth Selenium is also the perfect supercharger to Survival Shield X2 Mason Iodine, as both help support a healthy thyroid and many other systems.
[01:07:43.151 --> 01:07:48.052]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com to order your bottle of BioTruth Selenium before we sell it again.
[01:07:48.052 --> 01:07:56.554]  That's InfoWarsLife.com to secure your selenium and other key products that not only help yourself and your family, but also fund our operation against the globalists.
[01:07:56.554 --> 01:07:57.114]  A 360 win.
[01:07:57.114 --> 01:07:59.174]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight.
[01:07:59.174 --> 01:08:00.695]  This is the time to support InfoWars.
[01:08:00.695 --> 01:08:01.855]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:08:03.496 --> 01:08:07.884]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[01:08:10.669 --> 01:08:16.152]  Who claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[01:08:16.152 --> 01:08:24.677]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that.
[01:08:24.677 --> 01:08:36.124]  The Russians ran an extensive information war campaign against my campaign to influence voters in the election.
[01:08:36.124 --> 01:08:37.665]  And then they began to weaponize them.
[01:08:38.445 --> 01:08:54.399]  And they began to have some of their allies within the internet world, like InfoWars, take out pieces and began to say the most outrageous, outlandish, absurd lies you can imagine.
[01:08:54.399 --> 01:08:57.122]  But Trump doesn't challenge these lies.
[01:08:57.122 --> 01:09:03.528]  He actually went on Jones' show and said, your reputation is amazing, I will not let you down.
[01:09:06.038 --> 01:09:07.519]  And he hasn't let us down.
[01:09:07.519 --> 01:09:19.502]  On corruption, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[01:09:19.502 --> 01:09:25.785]  That was Hillary, Hitler-y, last week, saying that Infowars, in part, lost her in the election.
[01:09:25.785 --> 01:09:29.446]  Lady, your own campaign head said you lost the election.
[01:09:30.199 --> 01:09:31.140]  The Clinton name.
[01:09:31.140 --> 01:09:32.061]  We're sick of you.
[01:09:32.061 --> 01:09:34.122]  We're sick of Jeb Bush.
[01:09:34.122 --> 01:09:40.428]  Jeb Bush was polling in single digits for most of the campaign, but he got most of the money in the first half of it.
[01:09:40.428 --> 01:09:42.329]  This is a joke!
[01:09:42.329 --> 01:09:50.837]  Bill Clinton, Jerry Epstein's Lolita Express, Weiner and the child sexting garbage.
[01:09:50.837 --> 01:09:53.279]  By the way, we broke all that.
[01:09:53.279 --> 01:09:54.660]  And they know it.
[01:09:54.660 --> 01:09:55.521]  And they can't stand it.
[01:09:56.576 --> 01:10:05.980]  It's in the emails, sweetheart, how you want to keep us dumb and in the dark and hopeless, and how much you hate us.
[01:10:05.980 --> 01:10:08.041]  We know you're a monster.
[01:10:08.041 --> 01:10:20.507]  You chose as a lawyer to represent pedophiles, child kidnappers, and child rapists that raped little girls so hard their insides came out.
[01:10:20.507 --> 01:10:22.848]  I've had those little girls on air that are women now.
[01:10:25.287 --> 01:10:29.930]  And Hillary's on tape saying she knew the clients were guilty!
[01:10:29.930 --> 01:10:31.291]  And she laughed about it.
[01:10:31.291 --> 01:10:45.060]  What type of woman represents men that grab 11-year-old girls off their bicycles in Arkansas, and then what, six men rape them and beat them?
[01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:48.102]  So hard, their insides come out.
[01:10:48.102 --> 01:10:49.222]  That's Hillary Clinton.
[01:10:49.222 --> 01:10:50.723]  Remember that.
[01:10:50.723 --> 01:10:52.865]  No, I don't say horrible things, lady.
[01:10:54.082 --> 01:11:06.430]  I report on who you are and all the wars and all the jihadists you backed in Serbia, taking over Serbia, taking over Southern Serbia, Kosovo.
[01:11:11.144 --> 01:11:12.445]  And all the other evil things you've done.
[01:11:12.445 --> 01:11:14.426]  You're a monster.
[01:11:14.426 --> 01:11:18.368]  And you've had some of your top campaign people caught chipping in kids out of Haiti.
[01:11:18.368 --> 01:11:20.929]  Then they changed their name and still run children relief funds.
[01:11:20.929 --> 01:11:22.970]  And then we flew aircraft there.
[01:11:22.970 --> 01:11:30.073]  We documented, first, last year, the UN kidnapping thousands of children, killing hundreds.
[01:11:30.073 --> 01:11:35.596]  The AP, months after we reported it, came out and confirmed it all.
[01:11:35.596 --> 01:11:39.398]  And that's why they hit us.
[01:11:42.128 --> 01:11:48.851]  So anybody that supports these people, just remember, what side you're on.
[01:11:48.851 --> 01:11:52.792]  She says I have a dark heart.
[01:11:52.792 --> 01:12:03.356]  Lady, you're a joke.
[01:12:03.356 --> 01:12:09.979]  I was offered a million dollars, three million dollars, ten million dollars, which is nothing.
[01:12:11.858 --> 01:12:15.760]  Over a decade ago, in repeated offers to go be the next Rush Limbaugh.
[01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:19.382]  They told me the whole plan, basically.
[01:12:19.382 --> 01:12:25.324]  To be Glenn Beck before I said no, and they went in a year and had Glenn Beck ready.
[01:12:25.324 --> 01:12:28.946]  And they went and had him study me to be the new Alex Jones.
[01:12:28.946 --> 01:12:31.267]  That's why he hates me so much.
[01:12:31.267 --> 01:12:32.668]  Think of the level of these people.
[01:12:32.668 --> 01:12:33.208]  Oh, guess what?
[01:12:33.208 --> 01:12:35.409]  You failed!
[01:12:35.409 --> 01:12:36.750]  You didn't stop anything.
[01:12:39.099 --> 01:12:42.161]  In fact, your counterfeit only brought more people to me.
[01:12:42.161 --> 01:12:47.165]  It's like the invasion of the body snatchers.
[01:12:47.165 --> 01:12:49.487]  You didn't get the transfer done on time.
[01:12:49.487 --> 01:12:53.390]  Didn't go the way you wanted it to go, did it?
[01:12:53.390 --> 01:13:01.716]  And the reason I make it about Alex Jones is they've made it about me and they think that they're having a referendum on news and nationalism and information on me.
[01:13:01.716 --> 01:13:07.481]  And they think the fact that I'm real, they think the fact that I don't back down, that I tell it like it is, is some form of weakness.
[01:13:07.481 --> 01:13:08.702]  It's my strength!
[01:13:10.066 --> 01:13:14.529]  And it's your strength to not care what they think or care what they say.
[01:13:14.529 --> 01:13:22.294]  They're so radical in Hollywood that they want to teach elementary students about being different sexes.
[01:13:22.294 --> 01:13:25.877]  I mean, if parents did that, you'd say they were mentally ill or trying to screw their kid up.
[01:13:25.877 --> 01:13:29.799]  But if the government does it, it's okay.
[01:13:29.799 --> 01:13:31.861]  Think of all the... I've got stacks of news here.
[01:13:32.708 --> 01:13:37.912]  Where they're teaching at universities that being white is inherently evil and that white genocide is needed.
[01:13:37.912 --> 01:13:39.693]  I'm not even looking for these stories.
[01:13:39.693 --> 01:13:41.935]  I didn't even go through all my stacks today.
[01:13:41.935 --> 01:13:47.339]  I ran into three articles about them teaching white genocide at colleges.
[01:13:47.339 --> 01:13:54.344]  The lady that they just arrested for reportedly allegedly leaking hacked information is a federal contractor.
[01:13:57.386 --> 01:14:05.693]  The Intercept, who I think are good guys overall, reportedly didn't know that printer paper all has codes on it for at least 30 years.
[01:14:05.693 --> 01:14:09.036]  Secret Service claimed they wanted that to fund counterfeit bills.
[01:14:09.036 --> 01:14:09.816]  And she got caught.
[01:14:09.816 --> 01:14:11.538]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[01:14:11.538 --> 01:14:16.121]  Jailed NSA leaker.
[01:14:16.121 --> 01:14:19.104]  Being white is terrorism.
[01:14:19.104 --> 01:14:20.585]  That's right.
[01:14:20.585 --> 01:14:21.926]  Yes.
[01:14:21.926 --> 01:14:23.267]  I mean, talk about not being a winner.
[01:14:23.267 --> 01:14:24.128]  That's her last name.
[01:14:24.128 --> 01:14:25.289]  Jailed NSA leaker.
[01:14:26.997 --> 01:14:30.319]  Being white is terrorism.
[01:14:30.319 --> 01:14:33.441]  Isn't that just amazing?
[01:14:33.441 --> 01:14:34.582]  Paul Watson has an article on it.
[01:14:34.582 --> 01:14:35.663]  There's a bunch of other articles.
[01:14:35.663 --> 01:14:43.889]  And then I've broken down the fact Trump must seize control of the rogue government agencies that are completely out of control and leaking seven ways to Sunday.
[01:14:43.889 --> 01:14:47.211]  And she reportedly, allegedly, is just one of these people.
[01:14:47.211 --> 01:14:51.634]  And I have stacks of this where I can't, I'm not even looking for this news.
[01:14:51.634 --> 01:14:52.695]  Look at this report.
[01:14:54.201 --> 01:14:58.987]  Swedish women prove their tolerance by having sex with refugees.
[01:14:58.987 --> 01:15:02.511]  That's in mainstream German newspapers and Swedish newspapers.
[01:15:02.511 --> 01:15:06.156]  Talk about new meaning to the term Stockholm Syndrome.
[01:15:06.156 --> 01:15:08.378]  And we've shown you the video here, the edited video.
[01:15:08.378 --> 01:15:11.162]  We can't show the actual... ...coitus.
[01:15:12.924 --> 01:15:31.197]  of these women, Swedish particularly, go to these anti-racism concerts put on by Islamic hip-hop groups, and the women literally get grabbed, the men hold them down, and then run a train on them, where 10, 15, 20 men rape her till, again, they're bleeding everywhere.
[01:15:31.197 --> 01:15:35.040]  And you see the faces of these women while they're being raped, because the guys are videotaping it.
[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:40.684]  The total horror and the dismay, it looks like something out of hell.
[01:15:40.684 --> 01:15:42.465]  They just can't believe it's happening.
[01:15:46.425 --> 01:15:49.348]  And, I mean, should we show the footage behind me on the screen again?
[01:15:49.348 --> 01:15:52.071]  Because we just have the women's faces blown up.
[01:15:52.071 --> 01:15:53.512]  We ought to run that every day.
[01:15:53.512 --> 01:16:05.263]  Just their faces, they look around in horror as the men, two men holding each arm, each leg, their legs spread all the way back, and the Islamists just rape, rape, rape, rape, rape, rape, rape, rape!
[01:16:05.263 --> 01:16:06.885]  No feminists talk about it.
[01:16:06.885 --> 01:16:08.286]  No liberals talk about it.
[01:16:08.286 --> 01:16:10.889]  Nobody covers it because you don't do that.
[01:16:12.267 --> 01:16:15.488]  You tell Western men that they're not good.
[01:16:15.488 --> 01:16:18.708]  You tell Western men that they're evil.
[01:16:18.708 --> 01:16:27.590]  You tell Western men they're bad, because they have a conscience, whether they be black, white, Hispanic, of Arabic descent.
[01:16:27.590 --> 01:16:36.932]  You take people of Arabic descent, and they're Christians, low crime rate, no terror, one of the highest levels of money making, you name it.
[01:16:36.932 --> 01:16:39.112]  You take them that are Islamic, horrible record.
[01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:43.421]  Because it's the culture.
[01:16:43.421 --> 01:16:44.882]  He says that nature nurture.
[01:16:44.882 --> 01:16:46.983]  The culture of Islam is evil.
[01:16:46.983 --> 01:16:49.205]  White Muslims in Chechnya do horrible things.
[01:16:49.205 --> 01:16:50.405]  Some of the worst.
[01:16:50.405 --> 01:16:52.827]  And I don't want to just go off on some jag about Muslims.
[01:16:52.827 --> 01:16:58.891]  I was against the Iraq War because it was going to go in and take out a secular country and put in a radical system.
[01:16:58.891 --> 01:17:00.151]  But now the dam's broken.
[01:17:00.151 --> 01:17:01.232]  Now that they're here.
[01:17:01.232 --> 01:17:05.435]  Now there's thousands of known jihadis and hundreds of ongoing plots.
[01:17:05.435 --> 01:17:10.158]  Scotland Yard says they're not allowed to stop people they know are planning terror attacks.
[01:17:12.568 --> 01:17:19.630]  And then I get Stephen Colbert making jokes about Trump coming out and saying it's a travel ban.
[01:17:19.630 --> 01:17:21.610]  The president has that power in the law.
[01:17:21.610 --> 01:17:23.990]  Rogue courts have blocked him.
[01:17:23.990 --> 01:17:29.392]  His surrogates come out and say it's not a travel ban because they're hoping to play along with the lawyers and Trump's like, it is a travel ban.
[01:17:29.392 --> 01:17:31.072]  And they're going to keep killing people.
[01:17:31.072 --> 01:17:33.613]  These are from failed states that don't even have real passports.
[01:17:33.613 --> 01:17:38.014]  You'd be insane to let people in from Somalia.
[01:17:38.014 --> 01:17:39.774]  I mean, it is the best case.
[01:17:41.943 --> 01:17:42.843]  Point to show.
[01:17:42.843 --> 01:17:43.783]  Next is Libya.
[01:17:43.783 --> 01:17:44.724]  Next is Sudan.
[01:17:44.724 --> 01:17:52.105]  These are literal insane asylums where women are kept in cages.
[01:17:52.105 --> 01:18:01.627]  These people, it's like taking a crazy caveman out of some crazy death cult from another era and teleporting them into the middle of Los Angeles or New York City.
[01:18:01.627 --> 01:18:02.987]  It's insane.
[01:18:02.987 --> 01:18:04.248]  And they don't reform.
[01:18:04.248 --> 01:18:06.008]  They crap on the sidewalk right in front of you.
[01:18:13.516 --> 01:18:16.837]  And Trump has responded by saying, no, it is a travel ban.
[01:18:16.837 --> 01:18:19.118]  When we come back, I'm going to play that just briefly.
[01:18:19.118 --> 01:18:25.020]  We have Mr. Robbins, who's amazing, joining us from over in the UK.
[01:18:25.020 --> 01:18:27.061]  He's been witnessing all this and been warning of it.
[01:18:27.061 --> 01:18:31.562]  Was put in jail for years and beaten up because he criticized Muslims.
[01:18:31.562 --> 01:18:32.383]  I mean, they have law.
[01:18:32.383 --> 01:18:33.223]  He can't even criticize.
[01:18:33.223 --> 01:18:34.523]  They're God men.
[01:18:34.523 --> 01:18:37.304]  But now that's starting to change.
[01:18:37.304 --> 01:18:38.685]  So Tommy Robinson joining us.
[01:18:41.016 --> 01:18:42.437]  Author of Enemy of the State.
[01:18:42.437 --> 01:18:45.080]  We should carry that book.
[01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:46.821]  It's been sold out for months.
[01:18:46.821 --> 01:18:51.085]  A new shipment of bio-true selenium is now available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:18:51.085 --> 01:18:56.269]  And if you are deficient in selenium or you're taking synthetic selenium, I'm telling you, it's such a life-changer to take it.
[01:18:56.269 --> 01:19:01.374]  It goes with the high-quality X2, deep-earth crystal iodine, like a horse and carriage.
[01:19:01.374 --> 01:19:02.294]  All of these are essential.
[01:19:03.502 --> 01:19:06.484]  It's back in stock, 25% off out of the gates.

[01:19:11.907 --> 01:19:16.190]  This is the true selenium formula that has rocked the nutraceutical industry to its core.
[01:19:16.190 --> 01:19:24.855]  Nearly every other selenium supplement on the market is produced with synthetic selenium, but biotruth selenium is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[01:19:24.855 --> 01:19:32.560]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are well known for supporting the thyroid gland and immune system to DNA production and eyesight.
[01:19:33.579 --> 01:19:33.779]  I don't
[01:19:53.328 --> 01:19:57.391]  The new Z-Shield toxic metal and chemical defense support, excellent.
[01:19:57.391 --> 01:19:59.633]  It's 25% off as well.
[01:19:59.633 --> 01:20:02.075]  We make it very easy to support the InfoWarp.
[01:20:02.075 --> 01:20:02.955]  It's a no-brainer.
[01:20:02.955 --> 01:20:05.337]  A big, berky water filter is the one you need, period.
[01:20:05.337 --> 01:20:13.384]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA, and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses, and much more, right?
[01:20:13.384 --> 01:20:15.185]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.

[01:20:31.725 --> 01:20:34.208]  Many books have been written regarding the law of attraction.
[01:20:34.568 --> 01:20:41.052]  But what if all these books are missing the most important information we can use when it comes to activating this law in our lives?
[01:20:41.052 --> 01:20:51.458]  The new book, It's Time to Align, the most powerful self-help book ever written by Alan Lautinger, takes a look at how the law of attraction really works and how it is being suppressed in our lives.
[01:20:51.458 --> 01:20:57.142]  Learn how to overcome this manipulation and how to experience alignment with the creative power of the universe.

[01:21:02.466 --> 01:21:03.887]  Let's go to Devin in Florida.
[01:21:03.887 --> 01:21:06.189]  Devin in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:21:06.189 --> 01:21:06.669]  Great!
[01:21:06.669 --> 01:21:07.790]  Hey, thank you so much.
[01:21:07.790 --> 01:21:12.434]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[01:21:12.434 --> 01:21:14.195]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it.
[01:21:14.195 --> 01:21:21.942]  Because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret Swell, Vitamin Mineral Fusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[01:21:21.942 --> 01:21:22.842]  Wow, thank you.
[01:21:22.842 --> 01:21:25.224]  You're the top of the list that makes it all possible.
[01:21:25.224 --> 01:21:27.066]  Which nutraceuticals do you like best?
[01:21:27.066 --> 01:21:30.629]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion to be honest.
[01:21:30.629 --> 01:21:31.029]  That's amazing.
[01:21:31.309 --> 01:21:36.231]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at Infowarslife.com.

[01:22:03.035 --> 01:22:04.596]  I love sporting events.
[01:22:04.596 --> 01:22:06.237]  The atmosphere, the crowd.
[01:22:06.237 --> 01:22:08.059]  I even enjoy waiting in line.
[01:22:08.059 --> 01:22:14.943]  Because while I'm standing next to you, the RFID scanner in my pocket is capturing your personal information.
[01:22:14.943 --> 01:22:18.766]  From debit and credit cards, even your apartment building key.
[01:22:18.766 --> 01:22:22.628]  So you'll still be paying for this game long after it's over.
[01:22:24.029 --> 01:22:26.732]  Every two seconds, someone is a victim of identity fraud.

[01:24:20.805 --> 01:24:31.274]  Now, Stephen Colbert is an actor who has 19 writers, 17 of which are men, but he lectures us all day how America's sexist and bad, but Islam's good.
[01:24:31.274 --> 01:24:41.242]  And he makes little, you know, little jokes all day about how Trump doesn't like women and all this other made-up stuff, but never talks about Epstein and his Lolita Express and the pedophilia.
[01:24:41.242 --> 01:24:48.428]  He makes jokes about Uma Abedin and stuff I've said when her husband, you know, is pled guilty to his pedophile-type behavior.
[01:24:49.625 --> 01:24:50.086]  I don't know.
[01:25:05.646 --> 01:25:10.368]  And that's the president for infrastructure, like the president's putting us down.
[01:25:10.368 --> 01:25:14.009]  The United States has some of the worst railways in the world.
[01:25:14.009 --> 01:25:15.550]  We're worse than Mexico.
[01:25:15.550 --> 01:25:16.470]  Worse than other third world countries.
[01:25:16.470 --> 01:25:17.311]  It's a fact.
[01:25:17.311 --> 01:25:19.031]  Our roads are falling apart in some areas.
[01:25:19.031 --> 01:25:20.352]  Our bridges are falling apart.
[01:25:20.352 --> 01:25:21.052]  This is a fact.
[01:25:21.052 --> 01:25:25.994]  Trump's trying to ram through the biggest infrastructure spending ever, and that'll actually create jobs too.
[01:25:25.994 --> 01:25:26.575]  It's a win-win.
[01:25:26.575 --> 01:25:29.616]  It's one of the purest forms of things that government can really do that work.
[01:25:30.755 --> 01:25:33.156]  Something good that Roosevelt did.
[01:25:33.156 --> 01:25:34.016]  I give him credit for that.
[01:25:34.016 --> 01:25:36.417]  I mean, this works, okay?
[01:25:36.417 --> 01:25:37.757]  This is a Roosevelt-type deal.
[01:25:37.757 --> 01:25:42.759]  That's why I call Trump the real liberal, the blue-collar billionaire.
[01:25:42.759 --> 01:25:53.762]  And he makes a big joke about it that, oh, and he won't tell us what country it is, because we don't want those countries and companies to know we want it, because we want to bid and get a better deal on it.
[01:25:53.762 --> 01:25:55.903]  He knows it's going to cost a lot of money to get these systems.
[01:25:57.751 --> 01:25:59.992]  But they go, oh, but he'll tell the Russians everything.
[01:25:59.992 --> 01:26:03.554]  What, that there were laptop bombs two months after it was on the news?
[01:26:03.554 --> 01:26:05.595]  That's another lie!
[01:26:05.595 --> 01:26:14.139]  So when you know everything Colbert is saying is written by writers, sentence by sentence, crafted in boardrooms, every day for hours, on how to deceive you.
[01:26:14.139 --> 01:26:20.102]  He then reads off a teleprompter, and everybody talks about what a genius he is.
[01:26:20.102 --> 01:26:21.783]  It's sick!
[01:26:21.783 --> 01:26:23.464]  So here's the President.
[01:26:23.464 --> 01:26:23.944]  There's Colbert.
[01:26:27.073 --> 01:26:30.336]  Trump is still trying to push his Muslim travel ban.
[01:26:30.336 --> 01:26:35.340]  Remember, he had that executive order, he signed, showed everybody, and then that was struck down in court.
[01:26:35.340 --> 01:26:38.542]  Then it was rewritten to be a little softer, and then it was struck down again.
[01:26:38.542 --> 01:26:42.466]  Well, now a revised version is headed to the Supreme Court.
[01:26:42.466 --> 01:26:48.230]  And the administration's only chance of winning is not calling it a travel ban.
[01:26:48.230 --> 01:26:49.371]  Tell them why, Sean.
[01:26:49.371 --> 01:26:50.732]  It's not a travel ban.
[01:26:50.732 --> 01:26:52.593]  Because when we use words like travel ban,
[01:26:53.354 --> 01:26:55.176]  That misrepresents what it is.
[01:26:55.176 --> 01:26:57.798]  Got it, got it, okay.
[01:26:57.798 --> 01:27:04.323]  So this thing should get approved by the Supreme Court as long as nobody calls it a travel ban.
[01:27:04.323 --> 01:27:13.211]  People, the lawyers, and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a travel ban!
[01:27:23.684 --> 01:27:28.991]  Let's just pause for a moment, because I'm going to go back to the travel ban a little bit later.
[01:27:28.991 --> 01:27:30.113]  We have two clips.
[01:27:30.113 --> 01:27:32.376]  We play the travel ban, but it's all bull.
[01:27:32.376 --> 01:27:37.803]  These are countries, failed states, and Somalia, Libya, that our governments have helped fail.
[01:27:38.935 --> 01:27:45.358]  The Democratic Party particularly, and then now they're coming here and killing people, and then he's making fun of the President because he is being truthful.
[01:27:45.358 --> 01:27:47.659]  He's not spinning like his press secretary.
[01:27:47.659 --> 01:27:48.559]  That's refreshing.
[01:27:48.559 --> 01:27:52.701]  It is a travel ban on those failed states because they're not real countries.
[01:27:52.701 --> 01:27:57.784]  Islamist crazies are there giving passports to known terrorists.
[01:27:57.784 --> 01:27:59.885]  Now back to infrastructure.
[01:27:59.885 --> 01:28:06.628]  Our infrastructure is falling apart, and the air traffic controller systems we have are admittedly some of the worst in the world.
[01:28:06.628 --> 01:28:07.308]  It's a crisis!
[01:28:08.973 --> 01:28:12.574]  Trump wants to fix that.
[01:28:12.574 --> 01:28:13.814]  And so he's a bad guy.
[01:28:13.814 --> 01:28:14.534]  Here it is.
[01:28:14.534 --> 01:28:20.636]  The White House announced today that they're kicking off Infrastructure Week.
[01:28:20.636 --> 01:28:23.537]  It's like Shark Week.
[01:28:23.537 --> 01:28:28.438]  Except American infrastructure might actually kill you.
[01:28:28.438 --> 01:28:28.898]  Exactly.
[01:28:30.450 --> 01:28:33.613]  A week of focusing on our infrastructure, a week of innovating America.
[01:28:33.613 --> 01:28:35.534]  We used to be about that, Colbert.
[01:28:35.534 --> 01:28:38.076]  Not about worshipping Hollywood nobodies like you.
[01:28:38.076 --> 01:28:39.657]  Let's finish up.
[01:28:39.657 --> 01:28:47.003]  And it started with Trump's plan to turn the air traffic control functions of the FAA into a non-profit corporation.
[01:28:47.003 --> 01:28:53.068]  Although, to be fair, any company Trump runs eventually is a non-profit.
[01:28:53.068 --> 01:28:55.910]  Really, our economy's exploding.
[01:28:55.910 --> 01:28:56.770]  Best job numbers since 1984.
[01:29:01.565 --> 01:29:13.073]  We're proposing reduced wait times, increased route efficiency, and far fewer delays.
[01:29:13.073 --> 01:29:18.778]  Our plan will get you where you need to go more quickly, more reliably, more affordably.
[01:29:19.398 --> 01:29:26.322]  Plus more leg room and the whole can of apple juice.
[01:29:26.322 --> 01:29:27.723]  That's the stuff right there.
[01:29:27.723 --> 01:29:36.688]  And then they go on to attack him and make it a big joke that America's just fine and our infrastructure's great and how dare Trump be putting it down.
[01:29:36.688 --> 01:29:37.589]  I mean, this is just...
[01:29:38.712 --> 01:29:41.593]  They will attack anything and everything he does.
[01:29:41.593 --> 01:29:43.334]  Three trillion in the stock market.
[01:29:43.334 --> 01:29:45.055]  Hundreds of billions of new jobs.
[01:29:45.055 --> 01:29:46.976]  Millions of new people getting jobs.
[01:29:46.976 --> 01:29:52.318]  People having hope again and they're there trying to kill it at every step of the way because they hate America.
[01:29:52.318 --> 01:29:56.080]  Hollywood and the East Coast elite are disconnected.
[01:29:56.080 --> 01:29:56.620]  Space aliens!
[01:29:56.620 --> 01:29:58.561]  I mean they're equivalent to space aliens.
[01:29:58.561 --> 01:29:59.241]  They're from another planet.
[01:30:02.662 --> 01:30:12.152]  You might think the best ways to stop terrorism is maybe extreme vetting, not allowing unvetted refugees into your home, maybe not trying to do so many regime changes in Middle Eastern countries.
[01:30:12.152 --> 01:30:13.554]  Well, you're all wrong.
[01:30:13.554 --> 01:30:18.959]  In fact, Hillary Clinton says the way to stop terrorism is to understand other cultures and their food.
[01:30:18.959 --> 01:30:19.420]  Yes, really.
[01:30:19.540 --> 01:30:30.267]  She also defended London Mayor Sidi Kahn, the man who once represented 9-11 Al-Qaeda member Zacharias Moussaoui, called moderate Muslims Uncle Tom's, and said terrorism was part and parcel to living in a major city.
[01:30:30.267 --> 01:30:32.949]  And she added, Kahn has shown steady, determined leadership.
[01:30:32.949 --> 01:30:35.631]  Hillary said the best way to combating terror is to reach out to the world.
[01:30:35.751 --> 01:30:42.934]  In order to understand people living in foreign countries, getting to know one another, learning about the experiences, the lives, the cultures, the religions, the food.
[01:30:42.934 --> 01:30:47.376]  So does this mean we gotta be like into stoning women, cutting off their genitals, and throwing gays off buildings?
[01:30:47.376 --> 01:30:52.378]  This is not a time to lash out, to incite fear, to use tragedy and terror for political gain, said Clinton.
[01:30:52.378 --> 01:31:00.142]  A comment obviously aimed at Donald Trump, and anyone else who has correctly identified political correctness and tolerance of Islam as creating a fertile ground for terrorist attacks in the Western world.
[01:31:00.142 --> 01:31:03.003]  Rob Deere reporting for InfoWars Nightly News and InfoWars.com.
[01:31:03.323 --> 01:31:12.414]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:31:12.414 --> 01:31:20.523]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:31:20.803 --> 01:31:25.685]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:31:25.685 --> 01:31:32.468]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:31:32.468 --> 01:31:39.630]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:31:39.630 --> 01:31:46.493]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:31:46.673 --> 01:31:51.140]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:31:51.140 --> 01:31:54.544]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[01:31:54.544 --> 01:32:00.854]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.

[01:32:03.337 --> 01:32:09.860]  More than two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has been called the Iodine Conspiracy.
[01:32:09.860 --> 01:32:22.645]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ, and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, a bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[01:32:22.845 --> 01:32:26.506]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[01:32:26.506 --> 01:32:33.489]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[01:32:33.489 --> 01:32:46.353]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[01:32:46.353 --> 01:32:47.894]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[01:32:48.194 --> 01:32:54.578]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.

[01:33:27.719 --> 01:33:37.526]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:37.526 --> 01:33:39.287]  Right and wrong.
[01:33:39.287 --> 01:33:46.272]  A new world order.
[01:33:46.272 --> 01:33:51.756]  We see more religion of peace celebrations.
[01:33:51.756 --> 01:33:53.377]  Mexicans like to
[01:33:54.614 --> 01:34:04.856]  Eat enchiladas and have fun and shoot fireworks and drink tequila and beer on their holidays and hit piñatas.
[01:34:04.856 --> 01:34:12.838]  And, well, if you talk about white folks around here, we like doing the same thing on holidays or Fourth of July, same thing.
[01:34:12.838 --> 01:34:17.239]  Eat enchiladas or hamburgers or steaks and shoot fireworks off in the air.
[01:34:18.502 --> 01:34:30.764]  And pretty much everybody else, like you go to Thailand, or you go to China, or you go to Russia, or you go to Brazil, you go to Japan, they like doing the same thing on their holidays.
[01:34:30.764 --> 01:34:32.965]  It's pretty much the same deal.
[01:34:32.965 --> 01:34:39.726]  Get together, eat food, have a few drinks, light some lanterns off, shoot them up in the sky, whatever.
[01:34:39.726 --> 01:34:41.507]  Not with Islam.
[01:34:41.507 --> 01:34:47.748]  Why, during the month of Ramadan, we always see tens of thousands of Christians killed all over the world, hundreds and hundreds killed in the West,
[01:34:49.116 --> 01:34:51.677]  And so, George Soros and the UN, they had a plan.
[01:34:51.677 --> 01:34:56.218]  They said, just bring them in en masse.
[01:34:56.218 --> 01:35:00.999]  Bring the folks in that can't even live with each other in peace in their own countries.
[01:35:00.999 --> 01:35:03.720]  And everything will turn out just wonderfully.
[01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:09.041]  And now we've got people taken hostage in Australia by people screaming, this is for Allah.
[01:35:09.041 --> 01:35:10.382]  So I guess they got tired of Allah Akbar.
[01:35:10.382 --> 01:35:11.662]  Now it's, this is for Allah.
[01:35:12.526 --> 01:35:17.028]  And the same thing happened with this attack on a cop with a hammer, so the cops hurt and the jihadi's been shot.
[01:35:17.028 --> 01:35:22.091]  You've got the London Bridge and the Lion of London Bridge, the guy that took on the three guys.
[01:35:22.091 --> 01:35:31.156]  They come in, they start stabbing everybody, and one guy, they call him a football hooligan, 47-year-old guy gets up and starts fighting him until the police get there.
[01:35:31.156 --> 01:35:33.877]  And he gets stabbed in the neck and stabbed in the chest and stabbed in the arms.
[01:35:33.877 --> 01:35:36.819]  And some liberals are calling for him to be arrested for a hate crime.
[01:35:36.819 --> 01:35:37.379]  I'm not kidding.
[01:35:38.479 --> 01:35:40.799]  They charge you in England if you fight back.
[01:35:40.799 --> 01:35:45.921]  In fact, our guest, who is a hero, ladies and gentlemen, has been put in jail before.
[01:35:45.921 --> 01:35:48.701]  Tommy Robbins of TheRebel.media on Twitter.
[01:35:48.701 --> 01:35:49.761]  T. Robbins.
[01:35:49.761 --> 01:35:50.902]  New Arab.
[01:35:50.902 --> 01:35:52.362]  Amazing guy.
[01:35:52.362 --> 01:35:53.122]  Everybody loves him.
[01:35:53.122 --> 01:35:56.163]  I remember thinking he was a radical ten years ago when I first learned about him.
[01:35:56.163 --> 01:36:00.303]  Paul Watson, of course, really introduced him to me on air to show how ignorant I am in the last few years.
[01:36:00.303 --> 01:36:01.764]  I actually started following his work.
[01:36:01.764 --> 01:36:04.844]  Thank God he now actually makes documentaries and does news.
[01:36:04.844 --> 01:36:07.325]  We can see who he is, not what the media says about him.
[01:36:08.527 --> 01:36:15.496]  This is all part of a process as we all learn how lied to we've been and how we want to be politically correct even if we're libertarians.
[01:36:15.496 --> 01:36:17.579]  We want to try to live and let live.
[01:36:17.579 --> 01:36:21.764]  Well if people don't want to live and let live with us, it's suicide to go along with it.
[01:36:21.764 --> 01:36:22.785]  And so I'm done.
[01:36:22.785 --> 01:36:25.649]  The greatest victims of Islam are Islam.
[01:36:25.649 --> 01:36:26.370]  Are the people in it.
[01:36:27.990 --> 01:36:30.211]  And folks across the UK are fed up with it.
[01:36:30.211 --> 01:36:32.112]  So, he joins us.
[01:36:32.112 --> 01:36:33.792]  More and more, unfortunately.
[01:36:33.792 --> 01:36:35.793]  Used to be every month that there'd be a terror attack.
[01:36:35.793 --> 01:36:38.094]  Now it's every couple days in the UK.
[01:36:38.094 --> 01:36:39.674]  We almost just forget about them.
[01:36:39.674 --> 01:36:41.235]  That's what Khan, the mayor, said.
[01:36:41.235 --> 01:36:42.735]  Don't let Trump come, he said today.
[01:36:42.735 --> 01:36:44.536]  He's the problem.
[01:36:44.536 --> 01:36:47.277]  He said we should just get used to these terror attacks.
[01:36:47.277 --> 01:36:48.117]  And that it's no big deal.
[01:36:48.117 --> 01:36:50.038]  And that it's not Islam.
[01:36:50.038 --> 01:36:54.980]  That's the London mayor that said if the Brexit doesn't let more Muslims in, he'll just block it.
[01:36:55.871 --> 01:36:58.193]  Himself, he'll block the government and just bring them in.
[01:36:58.193 --> 01:37:00.256]  He's in sedition!
[01:37:00.256 --> 01:37:01.857]  But he's the good cop, bad cop thing.
[01:37:01.857 --> 01:37:03.219]  So, Tommy Robbins joins us.
[01:37:03.219 --> 01:37:04.019]  He has a new video.
[01:37:04.019 --> 01:37:06.702]  He goes to these mosques where they're radicalizing these very people.
[01:37:06.702 --> 01:37:07.603]  He confronts them.
[01:37:07.603 --> 01:37:08.744]  He shows where they live.
[01:37:08.744 --> 01:37:12.989]  People that are calling for jihad and the death live right next to schools.
[01:37:12.989 --> 01:37:14.350]  And that's what Muslims target.
[01:37:14.350 --> 01:37:14.951]  The weakest.
[01:37:14.951 --> 01:37:16.552]  They want it to be the most heinous.
[01:37:17.830 --> 01:37:18.170]  Hi Alex.
[01:37:43.544 --> 01:37:44.405]  Where do you want to begin?
[01:37:44.405 --> 01:37:46.866]  Because give us the numbers, the facts.
[01:37:46.866 --> 01:37:47.947]  What's going on the numbers?
[01:37:47.947 --> 01:37:50.869]  500 ongoing plots, Scotland Yard says.
[01:37:50.869 --> 01:37:52.970]  Is that accurate?
[01:37:52.970 --> 01:37:56.252]  500 open investigations, the plots.
[01:37:56.252 --> 01:38:10.401]  Three plots which you've seen, which is the Westminster attack by Colleen Mastood, the most recent one, London Bridge, and then the attack on the Children's Concert in Manchester, and five failed attempts in the last three months.
[01:38:11.101 --> 01:38:18.426]  We have over 3,000 Muslims on 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week watch that are a potential threat to us.
[01:38:18.426 --> 01:38:23.028]  And we have up to 23,000 to 25,000 Muslims who are on the terror watch.
[01:38:23.028 --> 01:38:25.830]  That's the reality of where we're at.
[01:38:25.830 --> 01:38:28.812]  Terrorism offences go up 60% every year.
[01:38:28.812 --> 01:38:33.135]  So what we need to understand, and everyone needs to understand, is there's problems not getting better.
[01:38:33.815 --> 01:38:42.922]  I remember David Cameron, after Lee Rigby was beheaded, a member of our military, on the streets of London, David Cameron set up a government task force.
[01:38:42.922 --> 01:38:51.028]  He'd come out the next day, like Theresa May's just done, he'd come out with this big speech about, we will now combat this extremism, we have this five-year plan.
[01:38:51.028 --> 01:38:54.011]  I remember sitting there at the time saying,
[01:38:55.134 --> 01:38:59.296]  It's only a lot worse in five years, because you still have not even named the problem.
[01:38:59.296 --> 01:39:00.816]  You haven't identified the problem.
[01:39:00.816 --> 01:39:11.901]  Now, in that five years, whilst David Cameron had this big plan, in that five years, four times as many Muslims joined ISIS than have ever signed up to the British military.
[01:39:11.901 --> 01:39:21.565]  We've allowed in excess of 500 of them, who have been trained in Syria, they've been out there already, they've been raping, pillaging, murdering.
[01:39:21.565 --> 01:39:22.366]  They're now back.
[01:39:23.206 --> 01:39:24.707]  Walking around our streets.
[01:39:24.707 --> 01:39:28.170]  I've actually been looking at the whereabouts, trying to find some of them this week.
[01:39:28.170 --> 01:39:34.454]  One of them's working in a car park, as a car park attendant at a hospital in the UK.
[01:39:34.454 --> 01:39:41.459]  The most recent, that video that you're showing there, that most recent video, that man's name is Abu Halima, okay?
[01:39:41.459 --> 01:39:44.521]  He's one of the most radical extremists in our country.
[01:39:45.502 --> 01:39:48.724]  He was working as a bus driver, Alex.
[01:39:48.724 --> 01:39:49.864]  A bus driver.
[01:39:49.864 --> 01:39:50.965]  In London.
[01:39:50.965 --> 01:39:54.806]  So, at any point that he wanted to ram that bus into whatever he could, he could've.
[01:39:54.806 --> 01:40:01.309]  But, obviously, if the government put him on a watch list, one of the top watch lists, they know he's a threat.
[01:40:01.309 --> 01:40:03.430]  They're fully aware of what a threat he is to us.
[01:40:03.430 --> 01:40:06.592]  Why don't we give him a jet pilot's license?
[01:40:06.592 --> 01:40:07.652]  Maybe he can fly 777s.
[01:40:10.118 --> 01:40:11.279]  This is how ludicrous it is.
[01:40:11.279 --> 01:40:14.520]  It doesn't sound believable, does it?
[01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:21.303]  They also went into his house and seized his passport because they knew he was going to try and fight jihad in Syria.
[01:40:21.303 --> 01:40:25.165]  So when you take away a Muslim's passport, you prevent him from going.
[01:40:25.165 --> 01:40:26.745]  We know he wants to fight jihad.
[01:40:26.745 --> 01:40:31.367]  That is leaving a ticking time bomb waiting to explode.
[01:40:31.367 --> 01:40:32.488]  Now, as we've seen recently,
[01:40:33.408 --> 01:40:35.009]  It's exploding on children.
[01:40:35.009 --> 01:40:42.972]  And most recently, innocent women sitting in a restaurant in London have had knives ploughed into their neck.
[01:40:42.972 --> 01:40:45.093]  So we know this man's a danger.
[01:40:45.093 --> 01:40:51.496]  And when I track him down and find out where he is, they've housed him in a lovely area with our money.
[01:40:52.580 --> 01:40:54.081]  Next to our kids.
[01:40:54.081 --> 01:40:54.841]  In a school.
[01:40:54.841 --> 01:41:12.447]  So even, I understand, because there was an attack after the last Westminster Bridge attack, there was another attack stopped, where they'd been following this Muslim for three, four months, and they followed him, and he had a bag full of knives, and he just got to Parliament, where he was just about to attack someone, and they jumped out and arrested him, yeah?
[01:41:12.447 --> 01:41:16.969]  So, in those circumstances, yeah okay, you can monitor them and arrest them.
[01:41:17.589 --> 01:41:23.313]  Where he lives, he has to climb over his back garden and he's in the children's playground.
[01:41:23.313 --> 01:41:25.154]  You can't spot that.
[01:41:25.154 --> 01:41:26.215]  They cannot spot that.
[01:41:26.954 --> 01:41:33.837]  So, the danger they're putting us in, as a public, it's an absolute liberty that the government are doing this.
[01:41:33.837 --> 01:41:44.661]  These men, especially the ones who have been fighting for ISIS, all the ones on the terror watch list, what you find out again, I've found out again, one of these London Bridge attackers was a failed asylum seeker.
[01:41:44.661 --> 01:41:46.182]  What's he doing here?
[01:41:46.182 --> 01:41:47.382]  What is he doing here?
[01:41:47.382 --> 01:41:53.485]  Not only is he a failed asylum seeker, one of the other ones appeared on a documentary 12 months ago called The Jihadi Next Door.
[01:41:54.411 --> 01:41:55.822]  They're walking around our streets!
[01:41:55.822 --> 01:41:56.608]  So let's be clear.
[01:41:57.912 --> 01:41:59.773]  They're launching more and more attacks.
[01:41:59.773 --> 01:42:04.136]  ISIS said three years ago, we're going to flood Europe and the UK with millions.
[01:42:04.136 --> 01:42:07.598]  And inside those millions of refugees, we have hundreds of thousands of operatives.
[01:42:07.598 --> 01:42:09.540]  And then we're going to have the sleeper cells activate.
[01:42:09.540 --> 01:42:15.864]  And we see exponentially them activating here, Europe, Australia, Russia.
[01:42:15.864 --> 01:42:18.686]  And when Russia gets bombed, our media actually goes, oh, you're bad.
[01:42:18.686 --> 01:42:19.206]  You deserve it.
[01:42:19.206 --> 01:42:26.231]  I mean, there is like an alliance with the left and Islam that you and others have been exposing for a long time.
[01:42:26.231 --> 01:42:27.292]  David Horowitz, you name it.
[01:42:28.192 --> 01:42:30.176]  And they're in the news.
[01:42:30.176 --> 01:42:33.200]  And then I have media say, I'm a conspiracy theorist.
[01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:37.046]  Jones believes Europe is knowingly bringing in ISIS.
[01:42:37.046 --> 01:42:41.754]  When Merkel and others advertise, come here, put you up in government housing, pay for you.
[01:42:42.898 --> 01:42:50.702]  Put you in nice areas, kick pensioners out of their Section 8 housing in Sweden, in Germany, in Denmark, in Finland.
[01:42:50.702 --> 01:42:56.605]  I mean, you cannot, in Italy, there's countless footage of old people and stuff being thrown out of their houses.
[01:42:56.605 --> 01:43:09.532]  Hotels being, the paying customers thrown out, and asylum seekers that have been shuttled in on Jordan Soros boats, literally, from the coast of Libya, brought into the country
[01:43:10.788 --> 01:43:12.509]  What is the master plan?
[01:43:12.509 --> 01:43:15.790]  A. Then B. Where do you see this going?
[01:43:15.790 --> 01:43:20.412]  Because I said this in the last hour, and I said it to create a controversy.
[01:43:20.412 --> 01:43:26.094]  I said, people that are known ISIS fighters, that have killed people, that have raped women, that have murdered, they all post videos of it.
[01:43:26.094 --> 01:43:27.775]  Why are you letting them back in?
[01:43:27.775 --> 01:43:29.136]  Why are you giving them government jobs?
[01:43:29.136 --> 01:43:32.477]  Why are you putting police cars outside their houses to quote, protect them?
[01:43:32.477 --> 01:43:34.678]  Like you just showed in a video we aired before you came on.
[01:43:34.678 --> 01:43:38.279]  It's on Infowars.com and on Rebel Media.
[01:43:38.279 --> 01:43:39.080]  When you look at this,
[01:43:41.698 --> 01:43:46.742]  I'm saying they should be tried for their crimes against humanity, just like Nazis at Nuremberg.
[01:43:46.742 --> 01:43:48.604]  They should be executed.
[01:43:48.604 --> 01:43:51.006]  And if they're convicted, I will kick the lever.
[01:43:51.006 --> 01:43:52.707]  I'm saying I'm willing to stand up to them.
[01:43:52.707 --> 01:43:54.128]  I'm sick of this.
[01:43:54.128 --> 01:44:02.955]  You've got these guys, 80% on welfare, literally wearing women's nightgowns, walking around wearing diapers, not working, usually weighing 400 pounds.
[01:44:04.056 --> 01:44:05.337]  And the maddest part of all of that
[01:44:34.454 --> 01:44:36.655]  Is that we're paying for them.
[01:44:36.655 --> 01:44:41.516]  We are actually paying for all of this ourselves, out of our taxpayers' money.
[01:44:41.516 --> 01:44:48.078]  We keep hearing, we're in an election campaign, there's an election on Thursday, we keep hearing about the shortage of police.
[01:44:48.078 --> 01:44:52.379]  Those 3,000 men, to monitor one of them, cost £2 million, yeah?
[01:44:52.379 --> 01:44:54.239]  To monitor one of them a year.
[01:44:54.239 --> 01:44:59.961]  Now, it takes three sets of nine men, each day, to monitor them.
[01:44:59.961 --> 01:45:02.682]  That's 27 officers a day, times by 3,000.
[01:45:04.735 --> 01:45:06.536]  And we've got a shortage of police.
[01:45:06.536 --> 01:45:08.976]  We've got a shortage of money.
[01:45:08.976 --> 01:45:14.678]  Let's also talk about what percentage of the birth defects are Muslims babies, because of the inbreeding, and what percentage of the crime?
[01:45:14.678 --> 01:45:23.981]  I mean, it's like, take the most barbarous, inbred, insane people, bring them into one of the most beautiful places, one of the freest places in the world, and turn it into a giant open sewer.
[01:45:23.981 --> 01:45:28.002]  3% of Britain is Pakistani.
[01:45:28.002 --> 01:45:32.123]  33% of all child defects are Pakistani.
[01:45:33.874 --> 01:45:35.676]  That's what we've imported.
[01:45:35.676 --> 01:45:37.337]  The costs, again.
[01:45:37.337 --> 01:45:39.859]  Like I said, the terrorism, all of these things.
[01:45:39.859 --> 01:45:41.621]  But the costs to our country.
[01:45:41.621 --> 01:45:53.412]  When we're going about, and old people are going out, when everyone's moaning about the cutbacks and the financial problems that the country's having, and then we look at what money we're spending.
[01:45:53.412 --> 01:45:56.654]  When you go on about the inbreeding, why?
[01:45:58.099 --> 01:45:59.800]  Where's 2017?
[01:45:59.800 --> 01:46:03.021]  We're fully aware of the problems when a cousin marries a cousin.
[01:46:03.021 --> 01:46:12.364]  Why are we allowing upwards of, I think it's upwards of 70% in one state in England called Bradford, upwards of 70% of them are married to first cousins.
[01:46:13.393 --> 01:46:14.954]  What are we allowing this?
[01:46:14.954 --> 01:46:17.696]  Well, we know why it happens because Mohammed did it.
[01:46:17.696 --> 01:46:24.480]  So because the Prophet Mohammed did it and we know that everything he did was perfect, then if he married his cousin, you can marry his cousin.
[01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:29.263]  If he said sleep with a six, marry a six year old and rape her when she's nine, you can.
[01:46:29.263 --> 01:46:32.465]  All the problems, again, all the problems come back.
[01:46:32.465 --> 01:46:33.306]  Even when we look at
[01:46:33.866 --> 01:46:44.298]  The thoughts of the British Muslim community, we see that 66% of them would not report on another Muslim who was going to fight or join ISIS, terrorism.
[01:46:44.298 --> 01:46:44.778]  66%!
[01:46:44.778 --> 01:46:46.020]  Now why is that?
[01:46:46.020 --> 01:46:51.746]  That's because of the scripture in the Quran that tells them they can never side or go against a Muslim because they'll end up in hellfire.
[01:46:51.906 --> 01:46:56.088]  And by the way, tell us about this guy that has police protection you just showed a few days ago.
[01:46:56.088 --> 01:46:58.570]  He's walking around on the video saying, what do you do to gays?
[01:46:58.570 --> 01:46:59.970]  I throw them off buildings.
[01:46:59.970 --> 01:47:06.394]  I mean, this guy is just saying he wants to do all this and he's not even from the UK and they won't get rid of him.
[01:47:07.290 --> 01:47:15.515]  Obviously, we had to cut that video in certain bits, but there's also things he says, where he basically admits that he, yeah, I support ISIS, basically sits there and admits it.
[01:47:15.515 --> 01:47:21.459]  So, when he had no, there was no police protection there until I went to his house.
[01:47:21.459 --> 01:47:27.263]  So once I've gone to his house, which is when I spoke to the police officer, I said, sorry, let me get this clear.
[01:47:27.263 --> 01:47:30.185]  Yesterday, you weren't sat here.
[01:47:30.185 --> 01:47:33.567]  So if he wanted to walk out of his house, and he's a danger, which we know he is,
[01:47:34.639 --> 01:47:40.001]  To any of the people living on this road, or any of those school children in that playground, you weren't here.
[01:47:40.001 --> 01:47:42.201]  The police, you were not here to protect us.
[01:47:42.201 --> 01:47:46.103]  But now that I'm here, here you are to protect him.
[01:47:46.103 --> 01:47:48.883]  Do you know how insane that is?
[01:47:48.883 --> 01:47:50.284]  Do you know how ridiculous that is?
[01:47:50.284 --> 01:47:52.785]  And again, this is us paying for it.
[01:47:52.785 --> 01:47:57.366]  You know how hard it is to get a British police officer in the UK for crimes?
[01:47:57.366 --> 01:48:03.308]  And here they are guarding an ISIS-supporting scumbag terrorist who should not even be breathing the same air as us.
[01:48:04.088 --> 01:48:05.990]  That's where we're at.
[01:48:05.990 --> 01:48:07.792]  And it's very frustrating because this isn't a one-off.
[01:48:07.792 --> 01:48:09.233]  This is happening across our country.
[01:48:09.233 --> 01:48:13.678]  They are literally housing jihadists next to our schools with our kids.
[01:48:13.678 --> 01:48:14.559]  And we're supposed to.
[01:48:14.559 --> 01:48:15.880]  And when you say, where is it leading?
[01:48:16.943 --> 01:48:22.469]  I don't wish for anything, but I have to... In all honesty, my phone has not stopped.
[01:48:22.469 --> 01:48:33.581]  And it's not stopped with every sort of character across the whole country who is demanding some sort of action and some sort of path or some sort of guidance in what to do.
[01:48:33.581 --> 01:48:35.303]  And what they're going to do, and I say it in that video,
[01:48:36.161 --> 01:48:44.924]  You're going to create a monster because when the police fail and the state and the system fails to protect its citizens, which it's doing now, right now, it fails.
[01:48:44.924 --> 01:48:46.265]  There's no argument about it.
[01:48:46.265 --> 01:48:47.685]  They have got blood on their hands.
[01:48:47.685 --> 01:48:56.369]  That most recent attack, if they'd have listened to what we've been asking them, if they'd have listened to the laws we've been demanding them to implement for almost a decade, then these people would be alive.
[01:48:56.989 --> 01:48:57.349]  That's it.
[01:48:57.349 --> 01:48:57.990]  There's no way.
[01:48:57.990 --> 01:48:58.410]  It's impossible.
[01:48:58.410 --> 01:49:00.451]  Let me expand on where you think this is going to go.
[01:49:00.451 --> 01:49:01.832]  Because look at Paris.
[01:49:01.832 --> 01:49:04.693]  They're reporting that their tourism is down by half the last few years.
[01:49:04.693 --> 01:49:06.314]  80% on the decade.
[01:49:06.314 --> 01:49:07.935]  I sent a crew there last year.
[01:49:07.935 --> 01:49:09.596]  There were no-go zones all over the place.
[01:49:09.596 --> 01:49:10.957]  We went to Brussels, Belgium.
[01:49:10.957 --> 01:49:12.338]  No-go zones everywhere.
[01:49:13.362 --> 01:49:20.451]  The Muslims are so aggressive, so hateful, they won't give you service at restaurants, gas stations, taxi drivers, more and more.
[01:49:20.451 --> 01:49:27.160]  There is a jihad on, and they admit that France is going bankrupt because of this, but they don't care.
[01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:28.162]  They won't stop.
[01:49:28.642 --> 01:49:28.943]  It's like...
[01:49:50.952 --> 01:50:01.815]  The security and the stability that we enjoyed as a generation, and the previous generation, growing up, we're handing it away, so our children will not enjoy those freedoms.
[01:50:01.815 --> 01:50:10.777]  Our children in years to come, the simple things of going to a pop concert, which we take for granted, will not be the same for the next generation.
[01:50:10.777 --> 01:50:16.459]  People going out and enjoying themselves, people going out into bars, there will be an install of fear, and that comes down to
[01:50:17.239 --> 01:50:19.700]  That comes down to strike fear into the heart of the disbeliever.
[01:50:19.700 --> 01:50:21.840]  Again, scripture in the Quran, 12 verses.
[01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:24.021]  That's why they target little girls, little boys.
[01:50:24.021 --> 01:50:25.721]  That's why they eat hearts.
[01:50:25.721 --> 01:50:27.882]  That's why they want to be as nasty as possible.
[01:50:27.882 --> 01:50:30.342]  They have videos of six-year-old boys killing people.
[01:50:30.342 --> 01:50:34.123]  It's to strike fear in our hearts and terrorize us into submission.
[01:50:34.123 --> 01:50:35.083]  And terrorize us.
[01:50:35.083 --> 01:50:36.744]  I see, I see we're not far off.
[01:50:36.744 --> 01:50:37.884]  I've been saying it for years.
[01:50:37.884 --> 01:50:40.625]  We're not far off the young children, but also
[01:50:41.425 --> 01:50:47.269]  Just starting on the end of one road and going into the houses and killing every people in the road, yeah?
[01:50:47.269 --> 01:50:55.375]  And when they do that, which at some point I believe they will, when they do that, the whole country, when they're going to bed that night, is a door locked, is a door locked.
[01:50:55.375 --> 01:50:57.117]  Everyone will be worried, everyone will be fearful.
[01:50:57.117 --> 01:50:58.878]  Stay there, let's talk about the time bomb.
[01:50:58.878 --> 01:51:01.400]  What you're warning of right now in Tommy Robinson.
[01:51:02.071 --> 01:51:03.072]  It's been said.
[01:51:03.072 --> 01:51:06.516]  Any society is only three missed meals away from chaos.
[01:51:06.516 --> 01:51:08.118]  Those times may be near.
[01:51:08.118 --> 01:51:09.019]  Think about it.
[01:51:09.019 --> 01:51:13.644]  Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[01:51:13.644 --> 01:51:18.290]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[01:51:18.630 --> 01:51:24.436]  And our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack.
[01:51:24.436 --> 01:51:31.142]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency.
[01:51:31.142 --> 01:51:33.685]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.
[01:51:34.125 --> 01:51:36.927]  That's where My Patriot Supply comes in.

[01:52:03.678 --> 01:52:05.259]  I love sporting events.
[01:52:05.259 --> 01:52:06.879]  The atmosphere, the crowd.
[01:52:06.879 --> 01:52:08.720]  I even enjoy waiting in line.
[01:52:08.720 --> 01:52:15.602]  Because while I'm standing next to you, the RFID scanner in my pocket is capturing your personal information.
[01:52:15.602 --> 01:52:19.423]  From debit and credit cards, even your apartment building key.
[01:52:19.423 --> 01:52:23.265]  So you'll still be paying for this game long after it's over.
[01:52:24.685 --> 01:52:27.386]  Every two seconds, someone is a victim of identity fraud.
[01:52:27.386 --> 01:52:32.829]  This Father's Day, protect Dad from crimes he can't see with ID Stronghold wallets in all Dad's favorite styles.
[01:52:32.829 --> 01:52:36.130]  Bifold, trifold, and even front pocket wallets and money clips.
[01:52:36.130 --> 01:52:40.072]  ID Stronghold pioneered RFID blocking technology over 10 years ago.
[01:52:40.072 --> 01:52:44.134]  ID Stronghold wallets look great and even cost about the same as wallets in most stores.
[01:52:44.134 --> 01:52:47.156]  I'm Wal Augustinowitz, founder and CEO of ID Stronghold.
[01:52:47.156 --> 01:52:49.777]  Protect yourself from crimes you can't see with ID Stronghold.

[01:53:30.734 --> 01:53:31.635]  It's a no-brainer.
[01:53:31.635 --> 01:53:34.016]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[01:53:34.016 --> 01:53:42.060]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?
[01:53:42.060 --> 01:53:43.981]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.

[01:53:56.708 --> 01:53:57.348]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[01:54:11.267 --> 01:54:16.011]  Again, let's get past Islam.
[01:54:16.011 --> 01:54:18.693]  The globalists are doing this by design.
[01:54:18.693 --> 01:54:19.294]  They admit it.
[01:54:19.294 --> 01:54:28.381]  The head of the UN Migration Group, who founded the EU, Peter Sutherland, says it's about ending Europeans' Europeanness.
[01:54:28.381 --> 01:54:30.943]  Well, if Europeans don't want to have kids, that's their issue.
[01:54:30.943 --> 01:54:33.725]  Bring in, like I said, people from Latin America or something.
[01:54:36.437 --> 01:54:40.980]  They're compatible with Western civilization, not folks from Muslim countries, folks.
[01:54:40.980 --> 01:54:41.720]  I mean, this is crazy.
[01:54:41.720 --> 01:54:44.882]  We'll go back to Mr. Robinson here in just a moment.
[01:54:44.882 --> 01:54:47.343]  TheRebel.media is the great outfit he's with.
[01:54:47.343 --> 01:54:51.365]  And of course, you can follow him on Twitter at T. Robinson, New Era.
[01:54:51.365 --> 01:54:52.926]  He also has his book, Enemy of the State.
[01:54:52.926 --> 01:54:57.549]  He should come on sometime just about what he's been through, what it's been like, how crazy it is.
[01:54:57.549 --> 01:55:01.131]  And then you know that's the model for Germany, the model for here.
[01:55:01.131 --> 01:55:03.072]  This is what we're going under.
[01:55:03.072 --> 01:55:03.952]  This is a plan.
[01:55:03.952 --> 01:55:04.893]  You can see the phases.
[01:55:06.375 --> 01:55:11.439]  Being brought in here, but before we go any further Please support the broadcast.
[01:55:11.439 --> 01:55:15.862]  We've got several new specials That we're running

[01:56:04.767 --> 01:56:08.331]  I want to thank you all for your support and your prayers.
[01:56:08.331 --> 01:56:12.276]  And yes, I've been hardcore about all this, folks, because people are in a malaise.
[01:56:12.276 --> 01:56:15.400]  They're in a state of going along with this garbage.
[01:56:15.400 --> 01:56:16.562]  They are in a trance.
[01:56:16.562 --> 01:56:19.225]  We've got to shock them out of it before it explodes too big.
[01:56:19.225 --> 01:56:20.807]  So, Tommy Robinson.
[01:56:21.548 --> 01:56:37.116]  One of the main leaders globally, exposing the true threat of Islam, how it says in the Quran, lay low, act like you're nice, until your numbers get big enough, then let attacks happen, play the part of the good cop, to lull them in until your numbers are high enough.
[01:56:37.116 --> 01:56:43.239]  Where does this end if people don't stand up, but we're getting to the main point,
[01:56:44.448 --> 01:56:47.449]  When you warn folks about a blow-up, how do you see this happening?
[01:56:47.449 --> 01:57:00.113]  What is the breaking point when the government disarms the people, then brings in an outside, third-world, cult-like piranha force, who are now enforcing Sharia law on the streets, kidnapping little girls everywhere, murdering everybody.
[01:57:00.113 --> 01:57:00.733]  What do you do?
[01:57:00.733 --> 01:57:03.373]  I mean, what do you see coming?
[01:57:03.373 --> 01:57:08.095]  I see us getting close to... I don't think... The situation in France, I don't think...
[01:57:09.206 --> 01:57:10.787]  I think England will be different.
[01:57:10.787 --> 01:57:15.009]  I can see a point where English men are going to react, and react en masse.
[01:57:15.009 --> 01:57:19.991]  And I'd say by the phone calls I've been receiving all week that they're pushing the point close already.
[01:57:22.898 --> 01:57:29.262]  I don't see any, we have no, there is no reasonable solution to this, with the problems they've imported.
[01:57:29.262 --> 01:57:30.163]  We all know that.
[01:57:30.163 --> 01:57:35.026]  So to get through this and to bring the change we need, there's going to be chaos either way.
[01:57:35.026 --> 01:57:45.093]  Because if we try to enforce the laws that we already have, which should be enforced upon that community, in order to bring about that change, there's going to be huge chaos from them, riots on mass levels.
[01:57:45.093 --> 01:57:51.577]  And if they ignore them, and they continue to allow it to go this way, I can see them creating English bombers.
[01:57:51.577 --> 01:57:52.358]  That's what they're going to do.
[01:57:53.038 --> 01:57:55.902]  They're going to do that.
[01:57:55.902 --> 01:58:02.349]  And again, just looking at it as a father of three, there's no light at the end of the tunnel here for anyone.
[01:58:02.349 --> 01:58:07.175]  So when people get desperate like that, which is why I keep saying, it's like they're forcing people down that path.
[01:58:07.895 --> 01:58:08.975]  That's how I see it.
[01:58:08.975 --> 01:58:12.397]  Until you address the issue and you show people hope.
[01:58:12.397 --> 01:58:16.398]  And when the system fails, again Alex, I'll bring you back to a situation.
[01:58:16.398 --> 01:58:19.019]  So there's a situation in a city called Leicester.
[01:58:19.019 --> 01:58:21.621]  Leicester is just north of where I live.
[01:58:21.621 --> 01:58:24.001]  And this is a Sikh community.
[01:58:24.001 --> 01:58:26.983]  There was a young Sikh girl who was gang raped by Muslim men.
[01:58:26.983 --> 01:58:28.763]  So the family went to the police.
[01:58:28.763 --> 01:58:32.245]  The police actually, just like they used to always do, they refused to do anything.
[01:58:32.987 --> 01:58:35.408]  So then... Tommy Robinson, stay there.
[01:58:35.408 --> 01:58:36.428]  We're back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:36.428 --> 01:58:38.289]  I'll go right to you to finish your story.
[01:58:38.289 --> 01:58:39.129]  Stay with us, folks.
[01:58:39.129 --> 01:58:43.411]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:58:43.411 --> 01:58:46.813]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:46.813 --> 01:58:55.056]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:55.056 --> 01:58:56.516]  Let's go to Deben in Florida.
[01:58:56.516 --> 01:58:57.797]  Deben in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:58:58.740 --> 01:58:59.200]  Great!
[01:58:59.200 --> 01:59:00.321]  Hey, thank you so much.
[01:59:00.321 --> 01:59:04.864]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[01:59:04.864 --> 01:59:13.990]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret Swell, 5mm Fusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[01:59:13.990 --> 01:59:14.710]  Wow, thank you.
[01:59:14.710 --> 01:59:17.352]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[01:59:17.352 --> 01:59:18.913]  Which Nutra-Certical does he like best?
[01:59:19.173 --> 01:59:22.654]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[01:59:22.654 --> 01:59:23.034]  That's amazing.
[01:59:23.034 --> 01:59:23.914]  That's really incredible.
[01:59:23.914 --> 01:59:27.295]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[01:59:27.295 --> 01:59:28.315]  I haven't felt this week.
[01:59:28.315 --> 01:59:29.996]  My morning was fantastic.
[01:59:29.996 --> 01:59:31.136]  And I love you guys.
[01:59:31.136 --> 01:59:33.397]  I love the Info Wars crew.
[01:59:33.397 --> 01:59:40.258]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[01:59:40.258 --> 01:59:41.278]  You will love it.
[01:59:41.278 --> 01:59:43.099]  I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.
[01:59:43.419 --> 01:59:47.842]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at Infowarslife.com.
[01:59:47.842 --> 01:59:54.708]  It's a win-win, Infowarslife.com.
[01:59:54.708 --> 01:59:57.370]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:13.544 --> 02:00:21.926]  Coming to you from the former United States of America, from deep in the heart of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:21.926 --> 02:00:22.367]  That's right.
[02:00:22.367 --> 02:00:23.247]  We're under FEMA.
[02:00:23.247 --> 02:00:23.827]  We're under the UN.
[02:00:23.827 --> 02:00:25.487]  We're under international treaty.
[02:00:25.487 --> 02:00:26.508]  Trump's trying to pull us out of it.
[02:00:26.508 --> 02:00:28.808]  The UK discovered they were under the unelected EU.
[02:00:28.808 --> 02:00:30.089]  They never had to vote in that.
[02:00:30.089 --> 02:00:30.709]  They're pulling out.
[02:00:32.122 --> 02:00:39.289]  All the stuff that was fringe, you know, 20 years ago is now mainstream now, and Donald Trump is blowing big holes in the globalist operation.
[02:00:39.289 --> 02:00:42.512]  Final segment we have with this amazing guest, Tommy Robinson.
[02:00:42.512 --> 02:00:45.555]  My website's InfoWars.com, our backup's PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:00:45.555 --> 02:00:50.140]  You can follow him on Twitter at T. Robinson, New Era.
[02:00:50.140 --> 02:00:52.242]  And again, his book is Enemy of the State.
[02:00:52.242 --> 02:00:53.222]  I want to carry his book.
[02:00:54.053 --> 02:01:03.338]  I know it's been out for a year or so, and I want to really focus on what he's doing in the reporting he's doing for Rebel Media because it's groundbreaking and he has a lot of courage.
[02:01:03.338 --> 02:01:08.361]  I don't have time to get into the whole story of what he's been through to bring you this information, but let's just say this, freedom's not free.
[02:01:08.361 --> 02:01:09.582]  So we got four minutes left.
[02:01:09.582 --> 02:01:10.982]  I appreciate your time.
[02:01:10.982 --> 02:01:15.525]  Other key points, your predictions, you were telling the story about the family, going to the police.
[02:01:16.715 --> 02:01:17.575]  Don't worry about the Sikhs.
[02:01:17.575 --> 02:01:21.157]  The Sikhs went to the police and the police done nothing.
[02:01:21.157 --> 02:01:21.957]  So then what happened?
[02:01:21.957 --> 02:01:24.598]  Which is what will happen in this circumstance as well.
[02:01:24.598 --> 02:01:27.139]  Sikhs went in to become vigilantes.
[02:01:27.139 --> 02:01:30.120]  And 20 to 30 Sikh men found the groomers.
[02:01:30.120 --> 02:01:36.002]  The men that were raping the girl, they found them, they attacked them, they attacked their businesses, they attacked their properties.
[02:01:36.002 --> 02:01:40.864]  What then happened, because of that, the police then arrested the Muslims for gang raping the girl.
[02:01:40.864 --> 02:01:42.084]  Then and only then.
[02:01:42.084 --> 02:01:43.345]  Because of that vigilantism.
[02:01:43.985 --> 02:01:46.508]  And then the 20 Sikh men were sent to prison.
[02:01:46.508 --> 02:01:50.111]  But the only reason why the Sikhs had to do that was because the system failed.
[02:01:50.111 --> 02:02:01.863]  Now if the government and the police continue to fail English people in our country, they continue to put our children at risk to bombs, put our women at risk to rape, then unfortunately that is what you're going to see.
[02:02:01.863 --> 02:02:05.787]  You're going to see English men getting together, you're going to see them finding where these men are.
[02:02:06.447 --> 02:02:15.691]  Well, I know they've tried to hire a bunch of social justice warrior police, but when I've been to the UK, a lot of the police are listeners.
[02:02:15.691 --> 02:02:18.332]  The word I'm getting is the police are going to start doing stuff vigilante.
[02:02:19.386 --> 02:02:24.387]  No, and again, I complain about what the police have done to me a lot.
[02:02:24.387 --> 02:02:25.547]  Look, that's not the police.
[02:02:25.547 --> 02:02:27.008]  That's the hierarchy of the police.
[02:02:27.008 --> 02:02:28.548]  That's political policing.
[02:02:28.548 --> 02:02:34.869]  Individual police officers that I meet, even the officer that was killed in the most recent one, run at them.
[02:02:34.869 --> 02:02:39.050]  So if you look at how the police reacted to the Manchester investigation, great.
[02:02:39.050 --> 02:02:45.712]  I don't have a bad word to say about your individual police officers on the ground because I have so many of them complaining to me every time I see them.
[02:02:46.292 --> 02:02:50.514]  Well, the police are just going to have to stand down when people take matters into their own hands.
[02:03:01.377 --> 02:03:02.718]  Unfortunately, that's what I see happening.
[02:03:02.718 --> 02:03:17.948]  You know, after the London riots, when London was burning, on the third day of the police failing to deal with it, you had 2,000 English men who were football hooligans, like this Millwall man, 2,000 English men who come out to fight.
[02:03:17.948 --> 02:03:20.489]  Well, at least, thank God for hooligans.
[02:03:20.489 --> 02:03:21.330]  We ought to have a t-shirt.
[02:03:21.330 --> 02:03:26.653]  I mean, why is it only hooligans that are, you know, like to go watch soccer and fight?
[02:03:26.653 --> 02:03:28.935]  At least they're still men.
[02:03:28.935 --> 02:03:30.136]  They're men that aren't afraid to fight.
[02:03:31.081 --> 02:03:38.706]  So, they're men that aren't afraid to fight, and unfortunately, what we've done in this generation, what we've done in Britain, is we've really pacified our men.
[02:03:38.706 --> 02:03:41.227]  And we've really created a weak generation of men.
[02:03:41.227 --> 02:03:45.550]  And until we... I don't know how you sit there while people are stabbing women in front of you and don't do anything.
[02:03:45.550 --> 02:03:47.031]  I mean, I would... It's so obvious.
[02:03:47.031 --> 02:03:51.514]  Pick up chairs, beat them over the head, attack them, grab a fire extinguisher off the wall, bash their brains out.
[02:03:52.054 --> 02:03:52.854]  I mean, it's so easy.
[02:03:52.854 --> 02:03:53.975]  It's so easy to kill people.
[02:03:53.975 --> 02:03:57.116]  I watch these Muslims, they're so pathetic when they're trying to kill somebody.
[02:03:57.116 --> 02:03:58.797]  It's like they're like a 14-year-old boy.
[02:03:58.797 --> 02:04:02.178]  I mean, they're a joke, is all I'm saying.
[02:04:02.178 --> 02:04:03.839]  Well, that's the problem.
[02:04:03.839 --> 02:04:07.220]  And the men... For years, I've been condemned.
[02:04:07.220 --> 02:04:09.861]  For years, the English Defence League was condemned.
[02:04:09.861 --> 02:04:14.063]  But the men that will be fighting on the front line of that battle will be those men.
[02:04:14.063 --> 02:04:16.224]  And when that battle comes, because it's coming...
[02:04:18.271 --> 02:04:22.395]  Well, and I know this, you guys aren't going to be targeting women and children.
[02:04:22.395 --> 02:04:25.638]  It's going to be the known Islamists, correct?
[02:04:25.638 --> 02:04:29.181]  It's like, I don't want to ever see that.
[02:04:29.181 --> 02:04:30.802]  I don't ever want to get to that situation.
[02:04:30.802 --> 02:04:35.046]  And when I say these things, I'm not encouraging or supporting or saying that's what it was.
[02:04:35.046 --> 02:04:37.148]  No, you're trying to stop it from happening.
[02:04:37.148 --> 02:04:38.049]  I'm warning.
[02:04:38.049 --> 02:04:38.549]  I'm warning.
[02:04:38.549 --> 02:04:44.195]  But the government is creating a guaranteed vacuum, like a chemistry experiment, that will explode.
[02:04:44.815 --> 02:04:45.535]  They are.
[02:04:45.535 --> 02:04:46.516]  They are.
[02:04:46.516 --> 02:04:47.677]  They're the ones allowing this.
[02:04:47.677 --> 02:04:48.937]  They're the ones bringing it in.
[02:04:48.937 --> 02:04:51.699]  They're the ones covering up for it, and so is MSM.
[02:04:51.699 --> 02:04:53.480]  All right, therebel.media.
[02:04:53.480 --> 02:04:55.661]  Tommy Robbins, thank you so much, sir.
[02:04:55.661 --> 02:04:56.581]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:04:56.581 --> 02:04:57.001]  Thank you.
[02:04:57.001 --> 02:04:59.323]  That's a real journalist and a real patriot and a real hero.
[02:04:59.323 --> 02:04:59.763]  We'll be back.
[02:05:02.392 --> 02:05:11.780]  You might think the best ways to stop terrorism is maybe extreme vetting, not allowing unvetted refugees into your home, maybe not trying to do so many regime changes in Middle Eastern countries.
[02:05:11.780 --> 02:05:13.281]  Well, you're all wrong.
[02:05:13.281 --> 02:05:18.686]  In fact, Hillary Clinton says a way to stop terrorism is to understand other cultures and their food.
[02:05:18.686 --> 02:05:19.126]  Yes, really.
[02:05:19.266 --> 02:05:30.019]  She also defended London Mayor Sidi Kahn, the man who once represented 9-11 Al-Qaeda member Zacharias Moussaoui, called moderate Muslims Uncle Toms, and said terrorism was part and parcel to living in a major city.
[02:05:30.019 --> 02:05:32.683]  And she added, Kahn has shown steady, determined leadership.
[02:05:32.683 --> 02:05:35.366]  Hillary said the best way to combating terror is to reach out to the world.
[02:05:35.486 --> 02:05:42.648]  In order to understand people living in foreign countries, getting to know one another, learning about the experiences, the lives, the cultures, the religions, the food.
[02:05:42.648 --> 02:05:47.089]  So does this mean we gotta be like into stoning women, cutting off their genitals and throwing gays off buildings?
[02:05:47.089 --> 02:05:52.110]  This is not a time to lash out, to incite fear, to use tragedy and terror for political gain, said Clinton.
[02:05:52.110 --> 02:05:59.871]  A comment obviously aimed at Donald Trump, and anyone else who has correctly identified political correctness and tolerance of Islam as creating a fertile ground for terrorist attacks in the Western world.
[02:05:59.871 --> 02:06:02.712]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars Nightly News and InfoWars.com.
[02:06:04.261 --> 02:06:09.763]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[02:06:09.763 --> 02:06:10.603]  I take this.
[02:06:10.603 --> 02:06:11.723]  My family takes this.
[02:06:11.723 --> 02:06:16.005]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[02:06:16.005 --> 02:06:20.466]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:06:20.606 --> 02:06:25.249]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[02:06:25.249 --> 02:06:26.390]  I don't feel good.
[02:06:26.390 --> 02:06:30.152]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[02:06:30.152 --> 02:06:32.834]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[02:06:32.834 --> 02:06:38.638]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[02:06:38.638 --> 02:06:41.600]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[02:06:41.600 --> 02:06:45.122]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[02:06:45.122 --> 02:06:47.364]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[02:06:47.364 --> 02:06:47.724]  I love it.
[02:06:47.884 --> 02:06:50.686]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[02:06:50.686 --> 02:06:51.686]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:06:51.686 --> 02:06:57.510]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[02:06:57.510 --> 02:06:59.531]  It's got a five-star rating.
[02:06:59.531 --> 02:07:01.553]  It's a win-win in fullwarslife.com.
[02:07:03.243 --> 02:07:05.123]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[02:07:05.123 --> 02:07:07.164]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[02:07:07.164 --> 02:07:10.065]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[02:07:10.065 --> 02:07:16.126]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[02:07:16.126 --> 02:07:25.309]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[02:07:25.309 --> 02:07:30.170]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children.
[02:07:30.390 --> 02:07:32.854]  Do the best job you can to purify your air.
[02:07:32.854 --> 02:07:40.885]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[02:07:40.885 --> 02:07:41.846]  The general public doesn't.
[02:07:43.050 --> 02:07:46.434]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[02:07:46.434 --> 02:07:50.558]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[02:07:50.558 --> 02:07:57.285]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[02:07:57.285 --> 02:08:01.370]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at m4warstore.com.
[02:08:24.364 --> 02:08:28.967]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:08:28.967 --> 02:08:36.153]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:36.153 --> 02:08:38.875]  Ben Garrison joins us.
[02:08:38.875 --> 02:08:40.436]  And at the bottom of the hour, I'm opening the phones up.
[02:08:41.560 --> 02:08:45.602]  People taken hostage by people yelling this is for Allah in Australia.
[02:08:45.602 --> 02:08:51.105]  A cop getting brutally attacked with a hammer and the jihadi gets shot in Paris.
[02:08:51.105 --> 02:08:55.487]  Just ongoing garbage during the month of Ramadan but none of it has anything to do with Islam.
[02:08:55.487 --> 02:08:57.027]  And I want to explain.
[02:08:57.027 --> 02:08:59.288]  I'm not just here harping on Islam all day.
[02:08:59.288 --> 02:09:06.432]  It's our governments bringing it in and admitting it's a clash of civilizations so they can then take our free society away.
[02:09:07.850 --> 02:09:19.838]  And you don't blame the cops, you blame the Congress, you blame the governments, you blame the presidents, you blame the prime ministers, you blame the UN, you blame the globalists that are doing this, and you stop them!
[02:09:19.838 --> 02:09:37.051]  And Trump has it under the law to be able to stop seven countries that have failed passport systems, like Libya, that our own previous government destroyed, and like Somalia, which everybody knows is a total failed state hellhole,
[02:09:38.564 --> 02:09:41.366]  Beyond hell holes, our own military won't go there.
[02:09:41.366 --> 02:09:42.746]  It's the most dangerous place on earth.
[02:09:42.746 --> 02:09:47.829]  It's not like certain areas of Mexico are dangerous and others aren't.
[02:09:47.829 --> 02:09:50.871]  Or North Korea is all authoritarian.
[02:09:50.871 --> 02:09:57.135]  All, all of Somalia is a veritable slave pit, a hell hole.
[02:09:58.387 --> 02:10:00.729]  Beyond anything else on earth.
[02:10:00.729 --> 02:10:03.512]  And they don't have working passport systems.
[02:10:03.512 --> 02:10:05.574]  Their airports aren't even properly working.
[02:10:05.574 --> 02:10:11.219]  And people are coming from there with these little pieces of paper issued by their mosque and are let into the country?
[02:10:11.219 --> 02:10:13.541]  Because the UN vets them?
[02:10:13.541 --> 02:10:19.086]  Because George Soros and all these guys that are on the board, they vet them?
[02:10:19.086 --> 02:10:20.828]  So Ben Garrison's been exposing that.
[02:10:20.828 --> 02:10:22.689]  He's been exposing the swamp.
[02:10:22.689 --> 02:10:23.270]  He is the
[02:10:25.660 --> 02:10:28.865]  Political cartoonist of this era.
[02:10:28.865 --> 02:10:29.386]  Hands down.
[02:10:29.386 --> 02:10:34.756]  There's some other great ones out there that we post on Infowars.com daily.
[02:10:34.756 --> 02:10:36.799]  But it's simply amazing.
[02:10:36.799 --> 02:10:37.741]  He's got a new book.
[02:10:39.125 --> 02:10:41.947]  He's self-published, it's amazing, it's like a coffee table book.
[02:10:41.947 --> 02:10:49.834]  The 2016 Presidential Election Collection, it is absolutely a must-see, especially for teenagers, especially for kids.
[02:10:49.834 --> 02:10:53.797]  This is the best way, because kids are into comic books, this is the best.
[02:10:53.797 --> 02:10:55.159]  I mean, it's just amazing.
[02:10:55.159 --> 02:10:57.381]  It's good for adults, it's good for children, it's good for everybody.
[02:10:57.381 --> 02:10:59.202]  But this is how you wake somebody up.
[02:10:59.202 --> 02:11:01.504]  Usually people that are leftist or globalist minions,
[02:11:02.905 --> 02:11:05.427]  They won't watch a film, they won't even read a long book.
[02:11:05.427 --> 02:11:06.708]  This is the weapon.
[02:11:06.708 --> 02:11:10.371]  And when I saw this a few months ago, I said, get it, carry it.
[02:11:10.371 --> 02:11:12.713]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:11:12.713 --> 02:11:17.357]  And I'll tell you what's great about this too.
[02:11:17.357 --> 02:11:18.978]  No reviews yet, it just went up.
[02:11:18.978 --> 02:11:23.782]  And it's a big, you know, color, print, glossy book.
[02:11:23.782 --> 02:11:26.404]  And you're supporting an independent publisher and it costs them a lot more to publish it.
[02:11:26.404 --> 02:11:28.866]  So you're doing a great job when you order it, helping support him and everything.
[02:11:29.738 --> 02:11:30.639]  They've tried to shut him down.
[02:11:30.639 --> 02:11:32.140]  They've tried to block him in the newspapers.
[02:11:32.140 --> 02:11:34.363]  He's been in newspapers for decades all over the country.
[02:11:34.363 --> 02:11:38.467]  Mainstream media kicks people like him out of their system.
[02:11:38.467 --> 02:11:40.970]  Anthony Frieda is just some of the top magazines in the country.
[02:11:40.970 --> 02:11:46.655]  They try to threaten him and others, you know, when they are just libertarian, not even, you know, pro-Trump.
[02:11:46.655 --> 02:11:47.696]  Just like, this is crazy.
[02:11:48.771 --> 02:11:56.781]  The left saying ban whites on campuses and just all this racism and all this division and Hillary and robbing the money from the Haitians and running child kidnapping rings.
[02:11:56.781 --> 02:11:59.946]  I mean, this is all out and Ben Garrison exposes it.
[02:11:59.946 --> 02:12:01.788]  Graphics.com.
[02:12:01.788 --> 02:12:02.669]  G-R-R.
[02:12:02.669 --> 02:12:03.390]  Graphics.com.
[02:12:04.071 --> 02:12:07.573]  And so, here is the new book, the 2016 Presidential Election.
[02:12:07.573 --> 02:12:12.856]  Much of his art festoons and decorates the halls here at the Infowars News Center in Austin, Texas.
[02:12:12.856 --> 02:12:13.937]  I want to work with him.
[02:12:13.937 --> 02:12:15.118]  I never have time to talk to him proudly.
[02:12:15.118 --> 02:12:15.978]  I should do this.
[02:12:15.978 --> 02:12:17.519]  About carrying his posters and everything.
[02:12:17.519 --> 02:12:20.821]  Another outpost of his great materials at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:12:20.821 --> 02:12:23.002]  But we're starting off with the book.
[02:12:23.002 --> 02:12:24.163]  Everybody needs to get it.
[02:12:24.163 --> 02:12:25.724]  InfowarsStore.com.
[02:12:25.724 --> 02:12:28.845]  But Ben, wow, what a crazy time to be alive.
[02:12:28.845 --> 02:12:31.527]  This is just, this is getting crazier and crazier.
[02:12:31.527 --> 02:12:32.648]  Your new Big Bad Wolf
[02:12:33.268 --> 02:12:41.557]  That illustration is one of the best I've ever seen, showing the little sheep of Europe saying we're not wolfaphobic running into the mouth of Islam.
[02:12:44.039 --> 02:12:57.464]  Yeah, I drew that one yesterday, and I almost did not put the word radical on there, but I said, well, I'll put radical, but very, very small, because Islam in and of itself is a radical religion, in my opinion.
[02:12:57.464 --> 02:13:00.224]  It's a religion of force, not peace.
[02:13:00.224 --> 02:13:02.845]  And we should be able to criticize Muhammad.
[02:13:02.845 --> 02:13:10.468]  I mean, look at the guy who killed, what, a thousand Jews in Medina, and he had slaves, and he had a half dozen wives, and he practiced barbarity.
[02:13:11.930 --> 02:13:12.971]  Compare him to Jesus.
[02:13:12.971 --> 02:13:14.052]  I mean, there's no comparison.
[02:13:14.052 --> 02:13:15.193]  Jesus was resurrected.
[02:13:15.193 --> 02:13:16.314]  Muhammad was not.
[02:13:16.314 --> 02:13:29.166]  So I'm going to start speaking out against it because I don't think these so-called peaceful Muslims are doing enough to stop what's going on by themselves, and they're in the best positions to do it.
[02:13:29.166 --> 02:13:36.192]  And I heard your last guess, and I was thinking to myself, a lot of this problem would be solved if the men are allowed to have concealed carry.
[02:13:36.192 --> 02:13:36.853]  Can you imagine?
[02:13:37.972 --> 02:13:52.260]  Can you imagine in the UK of even three of the guys out of 50 men and 50 women they estimate it was a pub full of people and in come three scumbags with knives and they go right to women because they just hate women so much.
[02:13:52.260 --> 02:13:58.963]  And then men stand there and one guy charges in and blocks them and probably saved ten lives in the eight minutes it took the cops to get there.
[02:13:58.963 --> 02:14:02.345]  One guy fought them for they say most the time.
[02:14:04.178 --> 02:14:06.960]  Well, that certainly wouldn't happen in Montana.
[02:14:06.960 --> 02:14:09.761]  All the men would get up and start bull-rushing those people.
[02:14:09.761 --> 02:14:12.823]  I was about to say, people think people are tough in Texas.
[02:14:12.823 --> 02:14:15.524]  Texas is, you know, what it is, but most people aren't from here.
[02:14:15.524 --> 02:14:21.608]  You don't mess with, people are nice in Montana, but you look at somebody wrong, you're going to be in a fist fight or a knife fight in two seconds.
[02:14:21.608 --> 02:14:23.549]  Well, I lived in Texas for ten years.
[02:14:23.549 --> 02:14:26.551]  Now, Montana is like Texas, only a much colder version.
[02:14:28.151 --> 02:14:31.152]  But I'm saying it's mainly Montanans that are still there.
[02:14:31.152 --> 02:14:32.173]  Yes, exactly.
[02:14:32.173 --> 02:14:39.896]  Although there are some liberal hotbeds, such as Missoula, and they want to bring in like 10,000 Muslim refugees, you know.
[02:14:39.896 --> 02:14:44.658]  And so there are a lot of people here in Montana, myself included, are trying to speak out against that.
[02:14:44.658 --> 02:14:46.559]  There's no reason for that.
[02:14:46.559 --> 02:14:53.022]  What would happen in a Montana bar if three jihadis came in with butcher knives?
[02:14:53.022 --> 02:14:54.062]  What's that?
[02:14:54.062 --> 02:14:57.764]  If three jihadis ran into a Montana bar, what would happen?
[02:14:59.773 --> 02:15:03.435]  Well, they'd probably be shot down.
[02:15:03.435 --> 02:15:06.316]  We wouldn't stand for that kind of guff, no.
[02:15:06.316 --> 02:15:10.038]  It just... It wouldn't happen, Alex.
[02:15:10.038 --> 02:15:10.458]  Not here.
[02:15:10.458 --> 02:15:15.640]  And if it does, well, it'll be in the news, and you'll see some dead jihadis.
[02:15:15.640 --> 02:15:16.000]  It's true.
[02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:28.866]  I know a lot of friends that have been up in Montana and stuff, and in Texas that have moved there, and they just said, they said, man, a lot of nice folks up there, but it's kind of got that mining thing left over from the Walla Walla West, and it's like,
[02:15:29.600 --> 02:15:34.964]  Montana is more like, I'm an old guy, Alex, and Montana is more like what America used to be, what I remember it used to be.
[02:15:46.793 --> 02:15:49.216]  You're not being pulled over by cops everywhere you go.
[02:15:49.216 --> 02:15:53.140]  There's no red light ticket camera sending you tickets in the mail.
[02:15:53.140 --> 02:15:58.306]  The freedom here is real and it's more palpable than say some place like Seattle.
[02:15:58.306 --> 02:15:59.988]  And everybody respects everybody else.
[02:15:59.988 --> 02:16:02.531]  Everybody looks at everybody like it's an old western because it is.
[02:16:02.531 --> 02:16:03.612]  They're friendly.
[02:16:05.742 --> 02:16:08.623]  You know, unless you cross them, but, you know, that's a good thing.
[02:16:08.623 --> 02:16:10.323]  You know, it's like the old South.
[02:16:10.323 --> 02:16:11.924]  They're all nice and polite down there.
[02:16:11.924 --> 02:16:12.384]  Why?
[02:16:12.384 --> 02:16:21.226]  Because if you insult some Southerner, there could have been a duel in the past, or there's going to be some kind of violent, you know, confrontation.
[02:16:21.226 --> 02:16:23.227]  So people are more polite, and that's a good thing.
[02:16:23.227 --> 02:16:30.369]  You don't want to go out and start insulting people higgledy-piggledy because you don't know what you're going to get, and that's the same way it is here in Montana.
[02:16:30.369 --> 02:16:30.769]  That's right.
[02:16:31.249 --> 02:16:43.837]  You know, I was against the Iraq War, I know you were as well, because that was a non-radical country that was being blamed for Saudi Arabia's behavior, and now we're toppling the regimes that let Jews and Christians live in peace, and putting radicals in.
[02:16:43.837 --> 02:16:46.759]  Why do you think Obama and Soros and all of them are behind it?
[02:16:46.759 --> 02:16:53.703]  Ben Garrison, again, the legendary, and I'm not just saying this, he is the top cartoonist in the world, just from page views and Google searches.
[02:16:53.703 --> 02:16:59.547]  It's hands down, you were already probably in the top two or three, but in the Trump era, you are numero uno.
[02:17:01.007 --> 02:17:05.168]  And it all happened, it really turned around in 2016 because of the election.
[02:17:05.168 --> 02:17:10.730]  And my wife and I sat down in late 2015 and decided, you know what?
[02:17:10.730 --> 02:17:13.791]  I'm going to draw more cartoons, this is too important.
[02:17:13.791 --> 02:17:16.612]  And we're going to go all out this year.
[02:17:16.612 --> 02:17:20.093]  And we saw our support snowball exponentially.
[02:17:20.093 --> 02:17:24.654]  I remember you were on in 2015, they were boycotting you, you were losing your big corporate deals.
[02:17:24.654 --> 02:17:28.395]  And you came on, we had a fine interview, and you said, me and my wife decided to double down.
[02:17:28.395 --> 02:17:30.296]  And now you are superstar.
[02:17:30.996 --> 02:17:33.517]  Yeah, well, I don't know about that, but we have seen success.
[02:17:33.517 --> 02:17:35.418]  We sold a lot of books, a lot of signed books.
[02:17:35.418 --> 02:17:36.398]  We sell a lot of prints.
[02:17:36.398 --> 02:17:40.960]  No, no, I understand monetarily, but I mean, when it comes to changing the world, bro, you're like The Voice.
[02:17:40.960 --> 02:17:42.341]  You're as big as InfoWars.
[02:17:42.341 --> 02:17:44.241]  You're as big as Drudge now.
[02:17:44.241 --> 02:17:46.002]  There's not much out there as big as this.
[02:17:46.002 --> 02:17:48.663]  You are now one of the main guns, brother.
[02:17:48.663 --> 02:17:50.544]  You are one of the main things defending this country.
[02:17:51.304 --> 02:17:53.244]  And there are plenty of room for more guns.
[02:17:53.244 --> 02:17:56.765]  I always encourage young cartoonists to join the fray.
[02:17:56.765 --> 02:17:59.825]  And a lot of them are afraid because they don't want to lose their job.
[02:17:59.825 --> 02:18:02.206]  They don't want to lose their, you know, they don't want to get trolled.
[02:18:02.206 --> 02:18:08.707]  And unfortunately, that's kind of the crucible that you're going to get hammered with when you start out.
[02:18:08.707 --> 02:18:11.047]  However, this is just too important.
[02:18:11.047 --> 02:18:17.068]  And what my cartoons are, Alex, I consider them visual alarm bells.
[02:18:17.068 --> 02:18:20.309]  Now, you get on your show and you get angry and you rant.
[02:18:21.255 --> 02:18:28.881]  My cartoons are a form of a visual rant, but they're visual alarm bells, and when that alarm bell goes off...
[02:18:29.597 --> 02:18:30.958]  And they get heard.
[02:18:30.958 --> 02:18:32.459]  It's going to make some people angry.
[02:18:32.459 --> 02:18:34.180]  Well, how'd you turn that damn thing off?
[02:18:34.180 --> 02:18:35.261]  And other people are happy.
[02:18:35.261 --> 02:18:36.942]  Well, you're doing a great service.
[02:18:36.942 --> 02:18:40.044]  So you're waking us up to what's going on.
[02:18:40.044 --> 02:18:44.868]  So I hear very positive things and I hear very negative things.
[02:18:44.868 --> 02:18:45.548]  But that's good.
[02:18:45.548 --> 02:18:46.929]  That's the mark of a good cartoonist.
[02:18:46.929 --> 02:18:47.430]  Well, I gotta say it.
[02:18:47.430 --> 02:18:51.433]  And the way you can draw women.
[02:18:51.433 --> 02:18:54.155]  I was just looking at the scales of justice.
[02:18:55.135 --> 02:18:56.856]  With the Goddess of Justice there?
[02:18:56.856 --> 02:18:59.678]  I mean, that... I would love... I wish you were a sculptor.
[02:18:59.678 --> 02:19:03.060]  I'd love to have a sculpture of that woman in my house.
[02:19:03.060 --> 02:19:07.822]  Well, that cartoon uses a basic cartoon principle called contrast.
[02:19:07.822 --> 02:19:15.707]  So you see the contrast between Hillary and her giant platter of corruption and then the non-Russian... And we're seeing right now with this latest... What's her name?
[02:19:15.707 --> 02:19:16.847]  Reality Winner.
[02:19:16.847 --> 02:19:17.608]  What a name.
[02:19:17.608 --> 02:19:17.888]  Well...
[02:19:18.872 --> 02:19:26.878]  It might be a tiny flame, Alex, but you're going to see the deep state left start fanning that little tiny flame into a gigantic confrontation.
[02:19:26.878 --> 02:19:45.713]  I was about to say, we knew the left was running all this leaking, which is illegal, because they're not leaking stuff that's illegal, they're leaking stuff that's legal when we see it, and they're leaking disinfo, mixing in lies, for this latest anti-America, says whites are the devil, white weirdo, self-hater, that's been caught reportedly
[02:19:46.638 --> 02:19:59.389]  Leaking classified info, Michael Moore has launched, it's on Infowars.com, a giant new leak organization to basically infiltrate the Trump administration and sabotage his attempts to save the country.

[02:23:01.323 --> 02:23:01.563]  I think?
[02:23:19.076 --> 02:23:20.778]  I actually don't even think about food.
[02:23:20.778 --> 02:23:22.319]  My knee pain went away.
[02:23:22.319 --> 02:23:29.025]  I've had some lower back issues and I've noticed that that went away and I can only contribute that to Andro 400.
[02:23:29.025 --> 02:23:32.448]  One thing that Andro 400 said on the radio ad is that it attacks belly fat.
[02:23:32.448 --> 02:23:33.669]  Well, let me tell you it did.
[02:23:33.669 --> 02:23:38.734]  The second month is where I saw a drastic change in the size of my stomach.
[02:23:38.734 --> 02:23:39.975]  I've lost six inches.
[02:23:39.975 --> 02:23:41.316]  This product really does work.

[02:24:04.915 --> 02:24:13.579]  Alright, we're gonna open the phones up in the next segment and Ben Garrison's gonna ride shotgun with us.
[02:24:13.579 --> 02:24:13.859]  800-259-9231.
[02:24:13.859 --> 02:24:17.841]  800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to join us.
[02:24:17.841 --> 02:24:20.342]  It's a compendium, a whole bunch of cartoons.
[02:24:20.342 --> 02:24:25.064]  Gee, it's gotta be... It's got a couple per page, or one per page.
[02:24:25.064 --> 02:24:25.725]  It's a hundred and...
[02:24:27.154 --> 02:24:28.935]  34 pages long.
[02:24:28.935 --> 02:24:29.515]  It's amazing.
[02:24:29.515 --> 02:24:31.096]  Ben Garrison Collection.
[02:24:31.096 --> 02:24:32.277]  Everybody needs this.
[02:24:32.277 --> 02:24:40.401]  And it's $29.95 because he self-publishes, and I know these books are a lot more expensive when they're color and they're glossy like this.
[02:24:40.401 --> 02:24:42.942]  They cost a lot more to print.
[02:24:42.942 --> 02:24:49.286]  I'm telling you, I ought to talk to Garrison about putting this stuff out in mass and getting this cost down for him and stuff because this needs to get to everybody.
[02:24:49.286 --> 02:24:53.368]  And I've wanted to do this for a while, but I just got so busy I haven't called him, so I'm kind of doing it on air right now.
[02:24:54.008 --> 02:25:01.271]  I know we've talked about putting on a few of his shirts, his t-shirts, a few of his designs, but I almost want this Big Bad Wolf one, but I'm gonna call him this afternoon.
[02:25:01.271 --> 02:25:05.953]  I got Megan Kelly here, I guess you just got here, so we're dealing with that too.
[02:25:05.953 --> 02:25:14.416]  800-259-9231, but get the new book at Infowarshore.com or Graphics, G-R-R-R, Graphics.com.
[02:25:14.416 --> 02:25:15.456]  Ben Garrison.
[02:25:15.456 --> 02:25:19.037]  Ben, I saw you shake your head because people couldn't see you, then we got into break when I said the legend.
[02:25:20.678 --> 02:25:24.343]  I see your stuff more than any other memes ever together.
[02:25:24.343 --> 02:25:26.325]  And it was already like that two years ago.
[02:25:26.325 --> 02:25:28.127]  It's exponential.
[02:25:28.127 --> 02:25:31.952]  And it's all so hard-hitting.
[02:25:31.952 --> 02:25:33.914]  There's some other great guys as well.
[02:25:33.914 --> 02:25:34.254]  What's it?
[02:25:34.254 --> 02:25:34.875]  Gracko?
[02:25:34.875 --> 02:25:35.956]  Or Grocker?
[02:25:35.956 --> 02:25:36.297]  What's his name?
[02:25:36.297 --> 02:25:36.998]  The other guy that's pretty good?
[02:25:38.843 --> 02:25:40.203]  Bracco or something?
[02:25:40.203 --> 02:25:40.924]  Oh, Bronco.
[02:25:40.924 --> 02:25:41.604]  Yeah, Bronco.
[02:25:41.604 --> 02:25:43.365]  He's a very prolific cartoonist.
[02:25:43.365 --> 02:25:45.025]  I mean, he really knocks them out.
[02:25:45.025 --> 02:25:46.666]  And by the way, I didn't mean that in disrespect.
[02:25:46.666 --> 02:25:47.726]  I'm teleprompter-free.
[02:25:47.726 --> 02:25:49.627]  I was just going out of memory.
[02:25:49.627 --> 02:25:50.847]  Tell us who he is.
[02:25:50.847 --> 02:25:52.608]  Oh, and there's another one.
[02:25:52.608 --> 02:25:54.208]  Glenn McCoy is really good.
[02:25:54.208 --> 02:25:57.569]  But you know, conservative cartoonists are very few and far between.
[02:25:57.569 --> 02:26:02.311]  The vast majority of cartoonists working in the mainstream media are liberals.
[02:26:02.311 --> 02:26:05.412]  They consider themselves centrists, but no, what they're drawing is
[02:26:06.172 --> 02:26:07.153]  Far left.
[02:26:07.153 --> 02:26:08.295]  They're anti-gun.
[02:26:08.295 --> 02:26:10.097]  They're pro-big government.
[02:26:10.097 --> 02:26:12.039]  They always want more taxes as a solution.
[02:26:12.039 --> 02:26:15.624]  But I see more of your cartoons in cyberspace than all of theirs combined.
[02:26:15.624 --> 02:26:18.047]  It just shows no... This is a new paradigm.
[02:26:18.875 --> 02:26:23.739]  Alex, the social media, the dinosaur media is dying.
[02:26:23.739 --> 02:26:28.922]  I released a cartoon a couple months ago and it had like 500,000 views on Facebook or something like that.
[02:26:28.922 --> 02:26:30.684]  I was saying, well that's more than a major metro.
[02:26:30.684 --> 02:26:32.565]  Who needs newspapers anymore?
[02:26:32.565 --> 02:26:44.854]  And young people are not reading newspapers or watching mainstream TV and they know it and they're desperate to try to get their fat thumbs on the internet and try to slow us down.
[02:26:44.854 --> 02:26:45.594]  But this is a new
[02:26:48.116 --> 02:26:49.217]  We're good to go.
[02:27:08.635 --> 02:27:16.941]  A lot of that, of course, I mean, I have to, I'm married to a great woman, Tina, who's worked very hard to make Girl Graphic a success.
[02:27:16.941 --> 02:27:22.625]  She works on the website, she does social media, she handles the prints and mailing, and I couldn't have done it without her.
[02:27:22.625 --> 02:27:26.088]  So I'm really lucky to have a woman like her to make this possible.
[02:27:26.088 --> 02:27:26.648]  Absolutely.
[02:27:27.549 --> 02:27:28.610]  That's why this is so important.
[02:27:28.610 --> 02:27:30.491]  It's an information war.
[02:27:30.491 --> 02:27:34.775]  And whereas you don't make a ton of money, you're doing well and you're reaching the world.
[02:27:34.775 --> 02:27:37.197]  And isn't that the incredible satisfaction?
[02:27:37.197 --> 02:27:45.143]  If you talk about one of your cartoons, 500,000 actual, you know, readers you can confirm on one page, but then you were duplicated on millions of pages.
[02:27:45.143 --> 02:27:46.764]  We've got the algorithms.
[02:27:46.764 --> 02:27:47.685]  We've got the numbers.
[02:27:47.685 --> 02:27:48.306]  We can look.
[02:27:49.667 --> 02:28:00.616]  Just what we post of your stuff, and you know, a cartoon that doesn't get a lot of traffic gets a hundred thousand readers, fifteen thousand shares, and then once it's shared, we can't track it anymore.
[02:28:00.616 --> 02:28:01.937]  So, I mean, it's crazy.
[02:28:01.937 --> 02:28:06.141]  Some of your stuff on our site gets out, like you said, a half million, a million times.
[02:28:06.141 --> 02:28:08.963]  That's just one site, and you're everywhere.
[02:28:08.963 --> 02:28:15.348]  That's changing the world, and it shows what just a few people working together can do, and it shows, can we even name
[02:28:16.169 --> 02:28:17.830]  The so-called liberal cartoonist?
[02:28:17.830 --> 02:28:19.231]  Does anyone even know who they are?
[02:28:19.231 --> 02:28:19.372]  No.
[02:28:19.372 --> 02:28:21.293]  No.
[02:28:21.293 --> 02:28:25.817]  Because no one wants to be force-fed this garbage anymore.
[02:28:25.817 --> 02:28:26.357]  That's right.
[02:28:26.357 --> 02:28:28.439]  That's one of the reasons I've, you know, it's like...
[02:28:29.947 --> 02:28:35.672]  The left says there's no such thing as a conservative cartoonist because you're not funny and your status quo wrong.
[02:28:35.672 --> 02:28:40.577]  The status quo is now the liberal deep state, the globalist deep state, the collectivist deep state.
[02:28:40.577 --> 02:28:51.866]  And so that's how come I've gotten so much attention and traction because it's like, well, finally somebody is coming out and drawing the cartoons that the mainstream media won't allow to be seen.
[02:28:51.866 --> 02:28:53.928]  That's a paradigm I've explained to media.
[02:28:53.928 --> 02:28:55.610]  When Rand Paul was being hardcore and he won that
[02:28:56.969 --> 02:28:58.872]  Upset Senate election.
[02:28:58.872 --> 02:29:00.354]  Politico say, how'd he win?
[02:29:00.354 --> 02:29:01.375]  And why are we such a big part of it?
[02:29:01.375 --> 02:29:04.379]  And I said, because he was seen as an outsider in his one.
[02:29:04.379 --> 02:29:06.502]  If he becomes establishment, he'll destroy himself.
[02:29:06.502 --> 02:29:09.426]  I said, if you want to destroy Rand Paul, Politico, endorse him.
[02:29:09.426 --> 02:29:12.550]  And they actually had that quote, but they just don't get it.
[02:29:13.499 --> 02:29:14.740]  They're a joke!
[02:29:14.740 --> 02:29:23.048]  And since everybody sold out, those of us that don't sell out actually win in the end, even though we didn't do it to be Maxiavellian, it turned out that way.
[02:29:23.048 --> 02:29:26.051]  I mean, InfoWars... I'm not even going to get into the numbers, it sounds like we're bragging.
[02:29:26.051 --> 02:29:27.732]  It's insane, okay?
[02:29:27.732 --> 02:29:29.554]  Even post-election, because that was the peak.
[02:29:29.554 --> 02:29:31.356]  Eighty-something million in one week confirmed.
[02:29:31.656 --> 02:29:32.237]  Not hits.
[02:29:32.237 --> 02:29:35.400]  Impressions, listeners, real stuff.
[02:29:35.400 --> 02:29:37.181]  Our old plateau was 30-something million.
[02:29:37.181 --> 02:29:38.903]  Our new plateau is almost 50 million a week.
[02:29:38.903 --> 02:29:42.306]  I mean, how do they compete with 50 million people a week?
[02:29:42.306 --> 02:29:46.089]  Conservatively, just on our platforms, we can confirm.
[02:29:46.089 --> 02:29:46.850]  Stay right there.
[02:29:46.850 --> 02:29:47.931]  Let me tell you something.
[02:29:47.931 --> 02:29:50.553]  Nobody knows, but I can tell you.
[02:29:50.553 --> 02:29:51.594]  I can tell you right now.
[02:29:51.594 --> 02:29:54.817]  100 million people see his work a week.
[02:29:54.817 --> 02:29:55.297]  Ben Garrison.
[02:29:55.297 --> 02:29:57.880]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.597 --> 02:30:11.960]  You might think the best ways to stop terrorism is maybe extreme vetting, not allowing unvetted refugees into your home, maybe not trying to do so many regime changes in Middle Eastern countries.
[02:30:11.960 --> 02:30:13.460]  Well, you're all wrong.
[02:30:13.460 --> 02:30:18.862]  In fact, Hillary Clinton says a way to stop terrorism is to understand other cultures and their food.
[02:30:18.862 --> 02:30:19.322]  Yes, really.
[02:30:19.462 --> 02:30:30.190]  She also defended London Mayor Siti Khan, the man who once represented 9-11 Al-Qaeda member Zacharias Moussaoui, called moderate Muslims Uncle Tom's, and said terrorism was part and parcel to living in a major city.
[02:30:30.190 --> 02:30:32.872]  And she added, Khan has shown steady, determined leadership.
[02:30:32.872 --> 02:30:35.574]  Hillary said the best way to combating terror is to reach out to the world.
[02:30:35.674 --> 02:30:37.855]  In order to understand people living in foreign countries.
[02:30:37.855 --> 02:30:38.856]  Getting to know one another.
[02:30:38.856 --> 02:30:42.638]  Learning about the experiences, the lives, the cultures, the religions, the food.
[02:30:42.638 --> 02:30:47.301]  So does this mean we gotta be like into stoning women, cutting off their genitals and throwing gays off buildings?
[02:30:47.301 --> 02:30:52.304]  This is not a time to lash out, to incite fear, to use tragedy and terror for political gain, said Clinton.
[02:30:52.304 --> 02:30:53.965]  A comment obviously aimed at Donald Trump.
[02:30:53.965 --> 02:31:00.069]  And anyone else who has correctly identified political correctness and tolerance of Islam as creating a fertile ground for terrorist attacks in the Western world.
[02:31:00.069 --> 02:31:02.931]  Rob Dewar reporting for InfoWars Nightly News and InfoWars.com.
[02:31:03.251 --> 02:31:04.072]  Embrics Essentials.
[02:31:04.072 --> 02:31:05.173]  That's my middle name.
[02:31:05.173 --> 02:31:17.625]  I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic and high quality.
[02:31:17.625 --> 02:31:23.390]  This is one of the top three selling organic brands in the country that puts out
[02:31:23.570 --> 02:31:26.754]  High-quality organic shampoo, mouthwash, you name it.
[02:31:26.754 --> 02:31:31.400]  And they're such patriots, they have let us basically keep their well-known packaging.
[02:31:31.400 --> 02:31:38.529]  It is an answer to prayer, and because we're cutting out the middleman, 20% off retail, sign up for auto-ship, an additional 25% off.
[02:31:38.529 --> 02:31:39.691]  It's all there.
[02:31:39.691 --> 02:31:40.372]  The Body Wash.
[02:31:40.652 --> 02:31:45.096]  The shampoo, the deodorant, the mouthwash, all of it is truly game-changing.
[02:31:45.096 --> 02:31:55.826]  It is the exact same product, just the name is different, Emrix Essentials, and it's on average 20% off what it would be in stores, buying it directly from InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:31:55.826 --> 02:31:58.449]  Help us win the Info War while getting products everybody needs.
[02:31:58.449 --> 02:32:02.513]  InfoWarsLife.com, where you'll find the entire line of Emrix Essentials.
[02:32:04.463 --> 02:32:08.226]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[02:32:08.226 --> 02:32:15.951]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[02:32:15.951 --> 02:32:24.556]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[02:32:24.556 --> 02:32:28.999]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[02:32:28.999 --> 02:32:34.343]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[02:32:34.583 --> 02:32:38.805]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[02:32:38.805 --> 02:32:42.226]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[02:32:42.226 --> 02:32:53.370]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[02:32:53.370 --> 02:32:56.271]  Discover why AnthroPlex is turning so many heads today.
[02:32:56.271 --> 02:33:02.233]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at InfoWarsLife.com with AnthroPlex.
[02:33:04.582 --> 02:33:08.949]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:33:08.949 --> 02:33:12.215]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:39.466 --> 02:33:42.810]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are financing the return of America.
[02:33:42.810 --> 02:33:44.652]  We're financing a war.
[02:33:44.652 --> 02:33:46.835]  An information war.
[02:33:46.835 --> 02:33:53.924]  And Hillary Clinton came out last week and said that InfoWars, she believes, is advising Russia on how to create the narrative.
[02:33:53.924 --> 02:33:56.627]  Now, that's obviously not true.
[02:33:56.627 --> 02:33:58.649]  We the American people bringing back Americana
[02:33:59.915 --> 02:34:04.376]  Are what Trump adopted because he already believed in that going back 30, 40 years on record.
[02:34:04.376 --> 02:34:06.376]  He was against NAFTA, GATT, you name it.
[02:34:06.376 --> 02:34:07.917]  And so together we're doing this.
[02:34:07.917 --> 02:34:13.358]  It's not like I came up with some blueprint or Ben Garrison came up with it or Ron Paul or Barry Goldwater.
[02:34:13.358 --> 02:34:14.718]  This is what Americana is.
[02:34:14.718 --> 02:34:18.439]  We're just bringing back what's been buried.
[02:34:18.439 --> 02:34:25.781]  You look at Archie Bunker, you know, he'd say some things I didn't agree with as a fictional character, but they'd mix it in with the writers with good stuff.
[02:34:27.059 --> 02:34:28.961]  To then discredit Americana.
[02:34:28.961 --> 02:34:30.884]  So, no.
[02:34:30.884 --> 02:34:32.926]  Russia doesn't get the credit for the win.
[02:34:32.926 --> 02:34:34.448]  Trump doesn't get the credit for the win.
[02:34:34.448 --> 02:34:37.953]  The American people and the listeners of this broadcast do.
[02:34:37.953 --> 02:34:41.917]  You, when you get excited, when you get involved, nothing can stop you.
[02:34:42.950 --> 02:34:46.774]  So please, tell folks about InfoWars.com every day.
[02:34:46.774 --> 02:34:52.700]  Share the videos by hand over the internet on your YouTube or your Twitter or your Facebook or on your own private email.
[02:34:52.700 --> 02:34:55.603]  Sign up for our free newsletter, InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:34:55.603 --> 02:34:58.606]  We send you articles, videos, specials, discounts, you name it.
[02:34:58.606 --> 02:35:05.352]  So when they do censor us with some issues or even our own sites they're trying to, believe me, we can then get you the information.
[02:35:05.352 --> 02:35:05.953]  InfoWars.com.
[02:35:07.520 --> 02:35:08.961]  Get these out to people.
[02:35:08.961 --> 02:35:11.203]  It is an act of resistance.
[02:35:11.203 --> 02:35:13.325]  They're trying to shut us down.
[02:35:13.325 --> 02:35:14.346]  Because here's the deal.
[02:35:35.595 --> 02:35:36.596]  We reach millions of people.
[02:35:36.596 --> 02:35:38.257]  It's a fraction of folks that actually buy stuff.
[02:35:38.257 --> 02:35:48.787]  If just a fraction more will go buy the BioTrue Selenium, very breast, highest quality, produced from mustard seed, it's a key.
[02:35:48.787 --> 02:35:55.493]  Find out about why deficiency in this is such a big, big cover-up and why from the mustard seed is the best.
[02:35:55.493 --> 02:35:57.454]  InfoWareStore.com, 25% off.
[02:35:57.454 --> 02:35:58.715]  That is now back.
[02:35:58.715 --> 02:36:01.057]  We also are introducing, and this is the top
[02:36:01.949 --> 02:36:10.837]  Three, it's in the top three private personal care product lines that you see in Whole Foods and other high-quality shops.
[02:36:10.837 --> 02:36:23.528]  If you look at the Emrix Essentials line of shampoo, non-nano, SPF 30, zinc oxide, sunscreen, bug repellent, unscented body wash, pure tea tree shampoo, long-lasting natural deodorant and more.
[02:36:24.909 --> 02:36:35.074]  I've seen those bottles if you shop at Whole Foods or other finer establishments and that's because it's, and the owner will even let me say who it is, but I don't want to compete with them.
[02:36:35.074 --> 02:36:41.298]  We're not planning to put this in stores, but it's 20% off their average retail, additional 25% off when you sign up for auto ship.
[02:36:43.029 --> 02:36:55.274]  But again, anybody that shopped at Whole Foods or Central Market or other places that have, you know, big organic lines of stuff, you can see that, wait, that's, that's, that's, that's, this, this product has the end cap at Whole Foods in many stores.
[02:36:55.274 --> 02:36:59.116]  The deodorant, you're saying, wait, I've seen that at Whole Foods, that's the best seller.
[02:36:59.116 --> 02:37:02.177]  Yes, it's the top, it's in the top three.
[02:37:02.177 --> 02:37:05.238]  Sometimes it's the top company, you know, because sales vary.
[02:37:05.238 --> 02:37:08.680]  We have it, the guy's a listener, it's awesome, and he's now even
[02:37:09.720 --> 02:37:10.400]  Spotting us.
[02:37:10.400 --> 02:37:11.221]  He's so cool.
[02:37:11.221 --> 02:37:15.962]  Sending us a thousand of each of new products we're launching without us even paying up front.
[02:37:15.962 --> 02:37:17.582]  He's that big a listener.
[02:37:17.582 --> 02:37:20.163]  So we're just really, really, this is a godsend to fund the operation.
[02:37:20.163 --> 02:37:22.004]  I mean, it's such a good deal.
[02:37:22.004 --> 02:37:25.425]  And the crew come up with the idea, Emmerich's Essentials, my middle name.
[02:37:25.425 --> 02:37:26.465]  So there you go.
[02:37:26.465 --> 02:37:28.206]  It's really a good deal.
[02:37:28.206 --> 02:37:30.206]  And we hope you buy a lot of it.
[02:37:30.206 --> 02:37:31.887]  That's why it's 25% off on auto ship.
[02:37:32.327 --> 02:37:36.051]  So you get it every 15 days, every 30 days, every 3 months, every 6 months.
[02:37:36.051 --> 02:37:38.113]  However you sign up, cancel any time.
[02:37:38.113 --> 02:37:41.136]  Emmerich Essentials, InfowarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:37:41.136 --> 02:37:44.019]  Alright, I've been ranting.
[02:37:44.019 --> 02:37:49.064]  I'm going to go back to Ben Kerrison for 5 minutes, give him the floor to make other points, and then go to your phone calls.
[02:37:49.064 --> 02:37:50.426]  He's riding shotgun with us.
[02:37:50.426 --> 02:37:52.007]  But I get so excited, Ben,
[02:37:52.668 --> 02:37:56.414]  Because despite how bad things are, people know the Federal Reserve is private now.
[02:37:56.414 --> 02:37:58.537]  They know there's a world government.
[02:37:58.537 --> 02:38:01.642]  All this stuff that MSM tried to suppress, they have failed.
[02:38:01.642 --> 02:38:03.405]  Bilderberg, it's out in the open.
[02:38:03.405 --> 02:38:06.189]  Where do you see all this going and what are other key points?
[02:38:07.472 --> 02:38:08.152]  Well, you're right.
[02:38:08.152 --> 02:38:16.157]  I mean, all these things that used to be called conspiracy theories have now been revealed to be flat out conspiracies.
[02:38:16.157 --> 02:38:28.764]  And so I say what Trump has done, and I consider him not necessarily a Democrat or Republican, but a populist president, a populist president like Andrew Jackson.
[02:38:28.764 --> 02:38:32.386]  And what Trump has done is really he's beaten the snakes out of their holes.
[02:38:32.386 --> 02:38:33.827]  So now we see him for what they
[02:38:34.207 --> 02:38:39.293]  What they are, and that in and of itself is quite a good accomplishment.
[02:38:39.293 --> 02:38:45.701]  More people are waking up and, you know, your show and my cartoons were just trying to continue that momentum.
[02:38:46.562 --> 02:38:51.184]  And people are realizing, you know, hey, we have something called a Constitution.
[02:38:51.184 --> 02:38:54.926]  The Constitution has given us unalienable rights.
[02:38:54.926 --> 02:38:57.267]  It's actually unalienable rights.
[02:38:57.267 --> 02:39:04.691]  But in actuality, we all have a lien on us due to our immoral system of money.
[02:39:04.691 --> 02:39:08.053]  So we have a lien on us and we're living in an illusion of freedom.
[02:39:08.053 --> 02:39:10.394]  But in reality, we're owned and we're kind of like
[02:39:12.553 --> 02:39:17.655]  Drifting more and more toward this police state and the prison planet as you call it.
[02:39:17.655 --> 02:39:28.359]  So we have to really wake up and not just go with our, like in my cartoon shows, these smiling lambs going brainwashed into the Great Maw.
[02:39:28.359 --> 02:39:30.020]  Great Maw of globalism.
[02:39:30.020 --> 02:39:35.222]  And they're using Islam as a tool to expedite that.
[02:39:35.222 --> 02:39:37.483]  There is something inherently scummy
[02:39:38.607 --> 02:39:40.248]  In the eyes of Islamists.
[02:39:40.248 --> 02:39:44.250]  I don't care if they're white, black, Hispanic.
[02:39:44.250 --> 02:39:45.270]  I mean, you name it.
[02:39:45.270 --> 02:39:47.311]  It's just so trashy.
[02:39:47.311 --> 02:39:48.332]  It's a prison culture.
[02:39:48.332 --> 02:39:50.213]  They recruit out of the prisons.
[02:39:50.213 --> 02:39:57.096]  And I mean, the women are just scared to death when you see, you know, orthodox Islamic women out in public with their husbands or their sons.
[02:39:57.096 --> 02:39:58.357]  They're bowing down.
[02:39:58.357 --> 02:40:04.440]  So there's this paradox of these spoiled, rotten Western women allied with it in some type of sick Stockholm syndrome.
[02:40:05.180 --> 02:40:10.462]  Complaining about the Western man that literally has put women on a pedestal.
[02:40:10.462 --> 02:40:13.123]  I mean, it is the most upside-down abomination.
[02:40:13.123 --> 02:40:15.264]  What do you make of that?
[02:40:15.264 --> 02:40:17.325]  Well, to me, it's not a religion of peace.
[02:40:17.325 --> 02:40:20.106]  It's a religion of hate and force.
[02:40:20.106 --> 02:40:27.749]  And compare that to Jesus, who preached love and forgiveness.
[02:40:27.749 --> 02:40:31.190]  You know, Islam preaches domination and revenge.
[02:40:32.273 --> 02:40:35.594]  And so, I mean, we just have to start calling it for what it is.
[02:40:35.594 --> 02:40:41.836]  And what the major disconnect I see is, why are these feminists all pro-Islam?
[02:40:41.836 --> 02:40:43.597]  I do not understand that at all.
[02:40:43.597 --> 02:40:47.859]  They should be out there with their hats on protesting Islam.
[02:40:47.859 --> 02:40:49.879]  And let's be clear, because we followed this.
[02:40:49.879 --> 02:40:54.701]  I sort of noticed it six, seven, eight years ago, that feminism kept defending it, or Stalin kept defending it.
[02:40:54.701 --> 02:40:55.561]  And then we'd talk about it.
[02:40:55.561 --> 02:40:56.342]  They said, oh, that's crazy.
[02:40:56.342 --> 02:40:57.322]  Feminists don't defend Islam.
[02:40:57.702 --> 02:41:01.844]  And then now they have Soros funded deals in Germany and Berlin and D.C.
[02:41:01.844 --> 02:41:15.549]  I've been there, and my crews have been there, where they hand out thousands of hijabs, the main sponsors, and then USA Today and everybody comes out, and just hundreds, I see articles every day, wear a hijab, go to a mosque, learn to be a Muslim, it's liberal!
[02:41:16.589 --> 02:41:19.211]  You know, Muslims are the true feminists, Huffington Post.
[02:41:19.211 --> 02:41:20.673]  I mean, what?
[02:41:20.673 --> 02:41:21.573]  What?
[02:41:21.573 --> 02:41:22.294]  What?
[02:41:22.294 --> 02:41:23.175]  What?
[02:41:23.175 --> 02:41:26.137]  And then USA Today, wear the hijab to fight Trump.
[02:41:26.137 --> 02:41:30.781]  What type of fruitcake BS is this?
[02:41:30.781 --> 02:41:33.023]  If you look at a map of Europe and you see
[02:41:34.302 --> 02:41:38.066]  Two countries that are mass importing Islam into their countries.
[02:41:38.066 --> 02:41:39.748]  One is Poland, the other one is Hungary.
[02:41:39.748 --> 02:41:43.192]  And you see that there are no terrorist attacks there.
[02:41:43.192 --> 02:41:43.973]  What does that tell you?
[02:41:43.973 --> 02:41:50.220]  And of course, Saros is very angry at countries like Hungary because they're not going along with the program.
[02:41:50.220 --> 02:41:52.602]  We need more of these countries in Europe.
[02:41:53.303 --> 02:41:58.754]  I think England is starting to wake up because they voted for Brexit.
[02:41:58.754 --> 02:42:00.998]  That's why we're getting hit now.
[02:42:00.998 --> 02:42:03.242]  That's exactly what I was going to say Alex.
[02:42:03.242 --> 02:42:05.406]  That's why you're seeing so much of that.
[02:42:06.995 --> 02:42:09.998]  The pushback there by Islam in Londonistan.
[02:42:09.998 --> 02:42:19.568]  So, it's like, we have to see people like Geert Wilders and we have to support people like Marine Le Pen.
[02:42:19.568 --> 02:42:24.814]  And let's remember, once we're just a few years down the road from this, they start killing people trying to kill Geert Wilders.
[02:42:25.174 --> 02:42:27.076]  Killing other politicians that speak the truth.
[02:42:27.076 --> 02:42:28.297]  I mean, this is vicious.
[02:42:28.297 --> 02:42:29.137]  This is dangerous.
[02:42:29.137 --> 02:42:30.458]  This is bullying.
[02:42:30.458 --> 02:42:34.922]  And when we were invading the Middle East and doing stuff to them, I was against it because that's bullying.
[02:42:34.922 --> 02:42:37.164]  Plus, we were getting rid of the good guys, quite frankly.
[02:42:37.164 --> 02:42:41.528]  And yes, Saddam and others are good guys compared to what we're facing.
[02:42:41.528 --> 02:42:45.911]  Why do you think, and then we're going to calls, Western governments are backing radical Islam?
[02:42:45.911 --> 02:42:46.412]  Ben Garrison.
[02:42:48.733 --> 02:42:52.814]  The Western governments are no longer answerable to the people.
[02:42:52.814 --> 02:42:59.755]  They're answerable to the Illuminati at the top, which want to control people.
[02:42:59.755 --> 02:43:01.055]  It's like this relentless push.
[02:43:01.055 --> 02:43:02.216]  You see it.
[02:43:02.216 --> 02:43:11.097]  They're never going to give up their Agenda 21 and their goals to achieve global government, or global governance, as Al Gore would call it.
[02:43:11.097 --> 02:43:15.198]  But it's always the same means to an end, and they're using
[02:43:15.798 --> 02:43:19.279]  The importation of Islam to break down Western civilization.
[02:43:19.279 --> 02:43:22.839]  It goes basically against the Magna Carta and common law.
[02:43:22.839 --> 02:43:30.181]  And when you get Sharia law, it's just, it's completely incompatible with Western civilization and our laws and our Constitution.
[02:43:30.181 --> 02:43:33.701]  And they're not going to give Sharia law up because it's part of their Quran.
[02:43:33.701 --> 02:43:35.382]  It tells them they have to implement that.
[02:43:35.382 --> 02:43:36.622]  So what can be done?
[02:43:36.622 --> 02:43:41.423]  Well, what can be done is they, the Muslims need a mass reformation or something to renounce
[02:43:42.563 --> 02:43:48.968]  I agree, but I think we're seeing the Reformation.
[02:43:48.968 --> 02:43:51.049]  I think Al-Qaeda is the Reformation.
[02:43:51.049 --> 02:43:52.670]  I mean, that's what Al-Qaeda says.
[02:43:52.670 --> 02:43:54.171]  No, this is the Reformation.
[02:43:54.171 --> 02:43:56.353]  We're getting back to our roots.
[02:43:56.353 --> 02:43:56.853]  Exactly.
[02:43:56.853 --> 02:43:57.754]  Well, that's, you know...
[02:43:59.151 --> 02:44:04.795]  The roots have always been pretty radical, haven't they?
[02:44:04.795 --> 02:44:06.857]  That's how they've been able to conquer.
[02:44:06.857 --> 02:44:10.259]  I mean, Syria used to be a Christian country, now it's Muslim.
[02:44:10.259 --> 02:44:14.703]  Look what they're doing to all the... Turkey used to be Christian.
[02:44:14.703 --> 02:44:17.825]  Yes, well, look what they're doing to the Coptic Christians in Egypt.
[02:44:17.825 --> 02:44:18.986]  They're still wiping them out.
[02:44:19.824 --> 02:44:23.288]  It's a war on Christianity and it's a war on Western civilization.
[02:44:39.585 --> 02:44:40.626]  I want to talk to you Alex.
[02:45:05.126 --> 02:45:08.190]  I just want to say thank you for all your fine products you have.
[02:45:08.190 --> 02:45:08.751]  Thank you.
[02:45:08.751 --> 02:45:12.196]  If I was rich, I would buy a ton more products.
[02:45:12.196 --> 02:45:16.381]  You know, I'm just a middle class... Brother, just spread the links and take action and pray for us.
[02:45:16.381 --> 02:45:16.902]  It doesn't matter.
[02:45:16.902 --> 02:45:17.423]  God bless you.
[02:45:17.423 --> 02:45:17.703]  Go ahead.
[02:45:17.703 --> 02:45:18.264]  What's your question?
[02:45:19.505 --> 02:45:22.966]  Well, not less of a question, but more like a statement.
[02:45:22.966 --> 02:45:33.548]  You know, obviously the terror that's going on, the attacks that are going on everywhere, you know, you guys really, you know, got my attention when you were talking about, you know, they're targeting women and these fake liberals and all these things.
[02:45:33.548 --> 02:45:44.530]  Well, you know, obviously the Third World War, you know, must be fomented by taking advantage of the differences caused by the Asian-Turkish Illuminati and, you know, the Islamic world
[02:45:45.163 --> 02:45:47.285]  You know, it separates from the nihilists.
[02:45:47.285 --> 02:45:49.547]  You know, Albert Pike lays it all out best.
[02:45:49.547 --> 02:45:59.214]  There's no doubt the globalists want to play Christianity off against Islam, have a big giant war, and they've been saying this for a hundred years, and then out of it bring this new religious system.
[02:45:59.214 --> 02:46:00.756]  And that's what Ben Garrison was just saying.
[02:46:00.756 --> 02:46:03.538]  They're using this clash to bring everybody down.
[02:46:03.538 --> 02:46:04.499]  I don't want to kill Muslims.
[02:46:04.499 --> 02:46:05.860]  I don't want to see Muslims die.
[02:46:05.860 --> 02:46:12.205]  But I'm not going to have guys running around in nightgowns on welfare, bitching and telling me that my family has to wear hoods over their heads.
[02:46:13.473 --> 02:46:15.414]  Exactly, you know, and this is all planned.
[02:46:15.414 --> 02:46:22.038]  You know, you say this all the time, and you know, you're highly intelligent on this, and you know, it's their plan.
[02:46:22.038 --> 02:46:31.944]  They want to bring them in here, collapse us, and take over again, and use, you know, cause cyber war, class war, religious war.
[02:46:31.944 --> 02:46:35.787]  Exactly, and then the media spins it and says that I say the cops are doing the bombings.
[02:46:35.787 --> 02:46:40.790]  No, the politicians are bringing in people that are known ISIS and Al Qaeda fighters
[02:46:41.650 --> 02:46:55.174]  I mean, if somebody's on video killing people, swearing allegiance to ISIS, they should be, when they go to the airport, they should be met by the military that literally takes them, you know, back to the country they came from, or takes them and tries them and then executes them.
[02:46:55.174 --> 02:46:56.574]  And that's not a radical statement.
[02:46:56.574 --> 02:47:01.096]  If we caught Nazis that had been involved killing people in World War II, try them and execute them.
[02:47:01.096 --> 02:47:04.277]  I'm not a vicious person, but you have to deal with these people.
[02:47:04.277 --> 02:47:06.757]  God bless you, I appreciate your call.
[02:47:06.757 --> 02:47:08.298]  Ben Garrison, you want to comment before we go to Dan?
[02:47:10.031 --> 02:47:14.477]  Well, yeah, what he said is right on.
[02:47:14.477 --> 02:47:18.263]  I mean, I don't want a confrontation with him either.
[02:47:18.263 --> 02:47:19.805]  And I don't hate Muslims.
[02:47:19.805 --> 02:47:20.165]  You know what?
[02:47:20.165 --> 02:47:21.107]  I don't know any Muslims.
[02:47:22.890 --> 02:47:29.515]  I hate what is happening when we are forced to respect something we don't respect.
[02:47:29.515 --> 02:47:30.436]  Let's face it.
[02:47:30.436 --> 02:47:42.065]  And I don't want to have to be forced to comply with the traditions and customs that Muslims bring in or else get accused of hate speech and then locked up.
[02:47:42.065 --> 02:47:43.166]  I want to be clear.
[02:47:43.886 --> 02:47:45.609]  Erica, but it's happening in Europe right now.
[02:47:45.609 --> 02:47:48.875]  If somebody speaks out against it, well, you know, you're going to lose your job.
[02:47:48.875 --> 02:47:50.056]  You're going to get a big fine.
[02:47:50.056 --> 02:47:55.065]  I have a friend in Germany right now, and he's outraged by the constant influx of immigrants.
[02:47:55.683 --> 02:48:02.570]  But he's reluctant to speak up too vociferously about it because they have hate speech laws and he doesn't want to get involved.
[02:48:02.570 --> 02:48:07.375]  But see, everybody has to violate those because they're unconstitutional so that it's ineffectual.
[02:48:07.375 --> 02:48:09.277]  That's the key is people have to break with that.
[02:48:09.277 --> 02:48:13.361]  I mean, by the way, folks, I'm not going to get into it.
[02:48:13.361 --> 02:48:16.083]  It's just the Muslims respect people that are aware of this.
[02:48:16.804 --> 02:48:17.845]  Especially the Shiites.
[02:48:17.845 --> 02:48:22.669]  I was invited to speak and have dinner with Achmed Denizci, didn't do it, for obvious reasons.
[02:48:22.669 --> 02:48:28.853]  I've been invited just currently to go meet with the Ayatollah, the ruler of... and I don't mean just go to an event, I mean go meet with him.
[02:48:28.853 --> 02:48:32.136]  So that's the kind of stuff goes on, but the media would have a heyday with that.
[02:48:32.136 --> 02:48:37.420]  I've been invited to some other countries to speak, long before all these controversies, and I didn't go for exactly those reasons.
[02:48:37.420 --> 02:48:40.742]  But let's just say this, they respect us for saying this.
[02:48:40.742 --> 02:48:41.583]  Okay?
[02:48:41.583 --> 02:48:42.544]  It's not the other way around.
[02:48:43.204 --> 02:48:48.486]  On the mainstream media, though, Alex, what the mainstream media, what you're allowed to do there is bash Christianity.
[02:48:48.486 --> 02:48:54.708]  That can be laughed at and humiliated, but you cannot humiliate or bash... Well, that's right.
[02:48:54.708 --> 02:48:55.808]  Let's go to Dan in Indiana.
[02:48:55.808 --> 02:48:58.569]  You're on the air, Dan.
[02:48:58.569 --> 02:48:59.209]  Alex.
[02:48:59.209 --> 02:48:59.770]  Yes, sir.
[02:48:59.770 --> 02:49:04.751]  Alex, give me a chance to speak my mind before you cut me off.
[02:49:04.751 --> 02:49:05.512]  Don't preface it.
[02:49:05.512 --> 02:49:06.052]  Just go.
[02:49:06.052 --> 02:49:06.532]  Start talking.
[02:49:07.361 --> 02:49:14.548]  Okay, alright, you got a big fan in Akron, Ohio with Christy Wall, Land O' Plenty, if you ever want to come and hang out.
[02:49:14.548 --> 02:49:18.752]  But my topic is an eye for an eye.
[02:49:18.752 --> 02:49:29.923]  I mentioned it the last time I was on the show, and Tommy Robinson said there will be people on the street, and he just confirmed what I was saying, an eye for an eye.
[02:49:30.430 --> 02:49:33.455]  Then Roger Stone did not answer my question.
[02:49:33.455 --> 02:49:35.217]  Who is Jared Kushner?
[02:49:35.217 --> 02:49:36.499]  Is he a big Satanist?
[02:49:36.499 --> 02:49:39.764]  He's got a big 666 on his building.
[02:49:39.764 --> 02:49:41.948]  I know Satanists need powers.
[02:49:42.677 --> 02:49:47.200]  And that location may be a magnet.
[02:49:47.200 --> 02:49:48.081]  Well, I'll say this.
[02:49:48.081 --> 02:49:51.764]  I'm not going to say we have no evidence that Kushner is a devil worshiper.
[02:49:51.764 --> 02:49:53.285]  He's an Orthodox Jew.
[02:49:53.285 --> 02:49:54.325]  And I don't think he's a bad guy.
[02:49:54.325 --> 02:49:55.706]  I think he's influenced by Democrats.
[02:49:55.706 --> 02:49:59.389]  That was already a prime piece of real estate that came up for sale.
[02:49:59.389 --> 02:50:01.270]  I think it's an unlucky number, 666.
[02:50:01.270 --> 02:50:07.735]  But, you know, I mean, the point is, is that what's your question or statement about Kushner?
[02:50:10.319 --> 02:50:25.579]  It could be a portal to another demonic dimension, that location, because don't you find it kind of curious that Rockefeller Center is right across the street from that and there was a house sitting at that same site
[02:50:26.425 --> 02:50:30.610]  Back in the day that used to have strange things going on.
[02:50:30.610 --> 02:50:32.312]  So that is a portal.
[02:50:32.312 --> 02:50:36.398]  That is like a magnet drawing negative energy.
[02:50:36.398 --> 02:50:41.043]  And he may be just a freak about the number 666.
[02:50:41.043 --> 02:50:45.068]  Well you know the UN building was built on a giant slaughterhouse facility.
[02:50:46.190 --> 02:50:48.312]  That's strange enough, but I'm not saying anything happened there.
[02:50:48.312 --> 02:50:56.180]  Because one of my great-great-great-great-great grandfather ancestors sold that land that the Rockefellers later bought that the UN building is on.
[02:50:56.180 --> 02:50:58.083]  It was just a bunch of swamp land he owned.
[02:50:58.083 --> 02:50:58.683]  He was wealthy.
[02:50:58.683 --> 02:51:00.565]  It was David Ayers or William Ayers.
[02:51:00.565 --> 02:51:01.947]  He came to Texas, started the revolution.

[02:52:04.830 --> 02:52:05.231]  You're on the air.
[02:52:06.212 --> 02:52:06.692]  Great!
[02:52:06.692 --> 02:52:07.813]  Hey, thank you so much.
[02:52:07.813 --> 02:52:12.477]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.

[02:52:14.198 --> 02:52:21.964]  Because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret Swell, Plymouth Interfusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[02:52:21.964 --> 02:52:22.805]  Wow, thank you.
[02:52:22.805 --> 02:52:25.247]  You're the top of the list that makes it all possible.
[02:52:25.247 --> 02:52:26.828]  Which Nutraceutical does he like best?
[02:52:27.068 --> 02:52:30.629]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[02:52:30.629 --> 02:52:31.949]  That's really incredible.
[02:52:31.949 --> 02:52:35.070]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[02:52:35.070 --> 02:52:36.450]  Like, I haven't felt weak.
[02:52:36.450 --> 02:52:38.151]  My morning was fantastic.
[02:52:38.151 --> 02:52:39.411]  And I love you guys.
[02:52:39.411 --> 02:52:41.652]  I love the Info Wars crew.

[02:52:49.713 --> 02:52:50.234]  I'm telling you.
[02:52:50.234 --> 02:52:51.594]  I've never bought a bad product.

[02:53:01.320 --> 02:53:03.282]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:53:03.282 --> 02:53:08.605]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:53:08.605 --> 02:53:10.187]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:53:10.187 --> 02:53:18.533]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:53:18.533 --> 02:53:24.237]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:53:24.397 --> 02:53:26.219]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:53:26.219 --> 02:53:28.382]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:53:28.382 --> 02:53:32.888]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:53:32.888 --> 02:53:35.091]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.

[02:54:20.949 --> 02:54:37.578]  She's standing where Matt Drudge was about a year and a half ago in the last big interview he gave.
[02:54:37.578 --> 02:54:38.618]  But you can't see her.
[02:54:38.618 --> 02:54:40.459]  You can see her white blouse.
[02:54:40.459 --> 02:54:42.900]  Princess Leia with blonde hair.
[02:54:42.900 --> 02:54:43.781]  Megyn Kelly is here.
[02:54:45.543 --> 02:54:46.903]  Yeah, go ahead and kick the fluorescent lights on.
[02:54:46.903 --> 02:54:48.264]  Let's see if we can see her there.
[02:54:48.264 --> 02:54:49.044]  So there you go.
[02:54:49.044 --> 02:54:52.025]  The conspiracy theory is true.
[02:54:52.025 --> 02:54:55.866]  Megan, you know, some people are saying that you're not really here actually to interview me.
[02:54:55.866 --> 02:54:56.266]  I'm here.
[02:54:56.266 --> 02:54:58.587]  She's there.
[02:54:58.587 --> 02:54:59.627]  So you just interviewed Putin.
[02:54:59.627 --> 02:55:00.867]  That was a big, big newsmaker.
[02:55:00.867 --> 02:55:02.808]  And the next is what?
[02:55:02.808 --> 02:55:03.288]  Really?
[02:55:03.288 --> 02:55:06.169]  What's there in this next Sunday?
[02:55:06.169 --> 02:55:07.709]  You're in good company.
[02:55:07.709 --> 02:55:08.709]  This Sunday, Aaron Andrews.
[02:55:08.709 --> 02:55:09.810]  Okay, Aaron Andrews.
[02:55:09.810 --> 02:55:11.930]  And then when's Trump?
[02:55:11.930 --> 02:55:13.491]  As soon as he says yes.
[02:55:13.491 --> 02:55:13.771]  Okay.
[02:55:16.539 --> 02:55:17.560]  Are you gonna be sweet to him?
[02:55:17.560 --> 02:55:19.201]  What do you mean?
[02:55:19.201 --> 02:55:20.121]  I am very sweet.
[02:55:20.121 --> 02:55:21.082]  He and I are all good.
[02:55:21.082 --> 02:55:23.744]  Would you sit in his lap?
[02:55:23.744 --> 02:55:24.444]  Move on!
[02:55:24.444 --> 02:55:25.785]  I know, I'm just having some fun.
[02:55:25.785 --> 02:55:27.726]  Okay, Megyn Kelly.
[02:55:27.726 --> 02:55:29.007]  That's actually a lookalike.
[02:55:29.007 --> 02:55:30.528]  That's actually not Megyn Kelly.
[02:55:30.528 --> 02:55:32.089]  Thank you, Megyn.
[02:55:32.089 --> 02:55:33.670]  I gotta say, she's prettier in person.
[02:55:33.670 --> 02:55:36.532]  I never know whether that's a compliment or not in my life.
[02:55:36.532 --> 02:55:37.032]  No, no, no.
[02:55:37.032 --> 02:55:37.973]  I mean it.
[02:55:37.973 --> 02:55:38.353]  I mean it.
[02:55:38.353 --> 02:55:39.154]  You're prettier in person.
[02:55:40.126 --> 02:55:42.007]  Okay, well, thank you, Megan.
[02:55:42.007 --> 02:55:43.848]  I'm ready to be interviewed.
[02:55:43.848 --> 02:55:44.488]  Okay, thanks.
[02:55:44.488 --> 02:55:45.749]  She's very nice.
[02:55:45.749 --> 02:55:50.512]  Because they had a bunch of newspapers saying she wasn't actually coming, like I'd lie or something.
[02:55:50.512 --> 02:55:56.115]  Because we've done like three corrections in 20 years, and then they say that that's fake news when I do a correction.
[02:55:56.115 --> 02:55:58.856]  Let's now go back to Ben Garrison.
[02:55:58.856 --> 02:56:01.037]  That's actually the Drudge chair right there.
[02:56:01.037 --> 02:56:07.321]  So if we wanted to give her a microphone, she could actually co-host From the Shadows and actually copy Matt Drudge.
[02:56:07.321 --> 02:56:08.481]  I don't think Megyn Kelly can help it.
[02:56:10.155 --> 02:56:11.657]  I can't afford you.
[02:56:11.657 --> 02:56:12.118]  I know.
[02:56:12.118 --> 02:56:13.259]  Hey, we're of the people.
[02:56:13.259 --> 02:56:15.522]  We don't have a lot of money around here.
[02:56:15.522 --> 02:56:16.022]  We're just here.
[02:56:16.022 --> 02:56:16.603]  No, I'm serious.
[02:56:16.603 --> 02:56:18.785]  We're just here in Texas.
[02:56:18.785 --> 02:56:22.009]  And, you know, we are just small-time little guys here.
[02:56:22.009 --> 02:56:24.932]  We're not the big, mighty NBC.
[02:56:24.932 --> 02:56:27.255]  Seriously, though, we should hand her a microphone.
[02:56:27.255 --> 02:56:30.439]  Somebody hand her a microphone on the remote just in case she wants it.
[02:56:32.541 --> 02:56:34.062]  Okay, I'm going to stop.
[02:56:34.062 --> 02:56:36.525]  Ben Garrison, this is crazy stuff going on.
[02:56:36.525 --> 02:56:37.927]  You heard the last caller.
[02:56:37.927 --> 02:56:41.190]  Let's just get into the politics of Jared Kushner.
[02:56:41.190 --> 02:56:47.096]  I noticed he's kept his head down the last month or so since it became a big controversy that he might have actually seen a Russian.
[02:56:47.096 --> 02:56:51.861]  If you even see a Russian now and you're in the Trump administration, you have to be burned at the stake.
[02:56:51.861 --> 02:56:53.603]  I don't think Kushner's that bad of a guy.
[02:56:53.603 --> 02:56:54.004]  What do you think?
[02:56:56.917 --> 02:56:58.337]  I've got mixed opinions about it.
[02:56:58.337 --> 02:57:02.298]  I'm still waiting to see how it's going to unfold.
[02:57:02.298 --> 02:57:08.900]  I've got some trepidations about his daughter having as much, much power as she does.
[02:57:08.900 --> 02:57:20.683]  But overall, I mean, I'll criticize Trump and I have drawn, I drew a cartoon with a tug of war with Bannon on one side and Kushner and Ivanka and others on the other, battling for his ear, so to speak.
[02:57:23.760 --> 02:57:25.541]  I just think it needs a little bit more time.
[02:57:25.541 --> 02:57:30.203]  I was very happy to see Trump reject the climate change stuff.
[02:57:30.203 --> 02:57:35.466]  That to me was him slapping the climate change Illuminati right in the face.
[02:57:35.466 --> 02:57:38.888]  And I was really happy to see it as a good sign and I hope he can continue.
[02:57:38.888 --> 02:57:45.751]  Because again, I see him as a strong populist president, similar to Andrew Jackson.
[02:57:45.751 --> 02:57:49.253]  And as you know, it took him two turns to take down the central bankers.
[02:57:50.053 --> 02:57:54.075]  And since then, I mean, the swamp has grown exponentially larger and deeper.
[02:57:54.075 --> 02:57:56.276]  But if anybody can do it, it's Trump.
[02:57:56.276 --> 02:57:57.457]  He's our last best hope.
[02:57:57.457 --> 02:58:00.618]  So I'm going to continue supporting him in my cartoons.
[02:58:00.618 --> 02:58:03.560]  Well, Ben Garrison, I wanted to get some more calls, but we're out of time.
[02:58:03.560 --> 02:58:06.781]  I'm going to do five more minutes and then punch out or so I can go to those calls.
[02:58:06.781 --> 02:58:07.882]  But we've got your new.
[02:58:08.886 --> 02:58:13.650]  Cartoon booklet, the 2016 presidential election collection at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:58:13.650 --> 02:58:14.851]  Great job producing this.
[02:58:14.851 --> 02:58:19.135]  You know, I'm now selling organic shampoo and stuff, the same brand Whole Foods sells.
[02:58:19.135 --> 02:58:22.518]  So I'm imagining they're going to call it snake poo and snake screen.
[02:58:22.518 --> 02:58:26.141]  I also sell sunscreen at Infowarsstore.com because everything we sell is evil and bad.
[02:58:26.141 --> 02:58:26.962]  We're not allowed to have...
[02:58:27.282 --> 02:58:30.004]  Our own media and our own industry, according to MSM.
[02:58:30.004 --> 02:58:33.446]  We'll see if Megyn Kelly's any different in her piece that's coming out in a few weeks.
[02:58:33.446 --> 02:58:39.250]  But right now, these snake cartoons, because again, nothing we have is real or good, is available at infowarestore.com.
[02:58:39.250 --> 02:58:43.573]  Only MSM that tells you there's no Islamic terror, you didn't build your business.
[02:58:43.573 --> 02:58:44.834]  They are the only ones that are right.
[02:58:45.618 --> 02:58:48.140]  And you didn't, again, and Obamacare is free.
[02:58:48.140 --> 02:58:50.823]  Fourth hour coming up with Paul Watson from France.
[02:58:50.823 --> 02:58:52.204]  Cytoteratax.
[02:58:52.204 --> 02:58:53.645]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:58:53.645 --> 02:58:56.408]  Visit Infowarslife.com to secure your chemister.

[02:59:03.874 --> 02:59:14.539]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix at Infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[02:59:14.539 --> 02:59:22.363]  In the history of Infowarslife, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mill Vitality, and so many others.
[02:59:22.363 --> 02:59:27.806]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[02:59:28.126 --> 02:59:32.569]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[02:59:32.569 --> 02:59:34.611]  And this part is most important.
[02:59:34.611 --> 02:59:41.436]  The ingredients in Vitamin Mineral Fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[02:59:41.436 --> 02:59:42.877]  That means it's clean.
[02:59:42.877 --> 02:59:43.997]  That means it's pure.
[02:59:43.997 --> 02:59:46.900]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the Infowar.
[02:59:46.900 --> 02:59:49.702]  That's Infowarslife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:59:49.702 --> 02:59:54.245]  Take action now before we sell out.
[02:59:54.245 --> 02:59:56.847]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:11.278 --> 03:00:12.359]  You want answers?
[03:00:12.359 --> 03:00:13.919]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:13.919 --> 03:00:16.260]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:32.290 --> 03:00:34.292]  Okay, to be continued on NBC.
[03:00:34.292 --> 03:00:35.353]  There you go.
[03:00:35.353 --> 03:00:37.335]  Having some fun, folks.
[03:00:37.335 --> 03:00:38.135]  We have Paul Watson.
[03:00:38.135 --> 03:00:45.803]  I don't know how much of that just got seen, but just like I was chasing Matt Drudge around with a microphone, but then I gave him the microphone.
[03:00:45.803 --> 03:00:47.424]  He goes, all right, I'll do five minutes.
[03:00:47.424 --> 03:00:52.829]  And it was an hour of mega, mega hit, tens of millions of extra views on YouTube.
[03:00:52.829 --> 03:00:53.750]  So that was fun.
[03:00:53.750 --> 03:00:57.133]  Do we have His Britannic Majesty joining us from New York?
[03:00:58.507 --> 03:01:00.890]  From Brittany, I guess he's over there in France right now.
[03:01:00.890 --> 03:01:04.315]  Paul Watson, Skype audio only in this hour.
[03:01:04.315 --> 03:01:10.423]  More terror attacks in France, terror attacks everywhere that have nothing to do with Islam, Paul.
[03:01:10.423 --> 03:01:11.264]  Well, that's right, Alex.
[03:01:11.264 --> 03:01:15.129]  We're on Ramadan, bomb-a-thon, stab-a-thon, whatever you want to call it.
[03:01:15.129 --> 03:01:15.310]  Day 11.
[03:01:17.444 --> 03:01:27.957]  59 attacks so far in that 11 day period, 627 dead after ISIS called for attacks during Ramadan, but of course it has nothing to do with Islam.
[03:01:27.957 --> 03:01:35.926]  And as he said, we had another attack in Paris today at the Notre Dame Cathedral, which is normally surrounded by troops because Islam is so peaceful.
[03:01:36.807 --> 03:01:40.111]  And it was an Algerian student screaming, this is for Syria!
[03:01:40.111 --> 03:01:46.017]  So I guess they'll be debating whether it's political or whether it's terrorism for the next 48 hours.
[03:01:46.017 --> 03:01:50.682]  He tried to attack a police officer with hammers, with other crude instruments.
[03:01:50.682 --> 03:01:52.464]  He was shot, he was injured.
[03:01:52.464 --> 03:01:58.910]  So we're now at the point, Alex, where it's not just coerced plots, it's not cells of individuals that are radicalised.
[03:01:59.511 --> 03:02:06.883]  It's just, students that just run around on a whim go absolutely insane with hammers and just strike out at anyone they can.
[03:02:06.883 --> 03:02:11.470]  So that's the situation right now in France, which is basically a dying country.
[03:02:12.634 --> 03:02:17.399]  Tell that people are just absolutely at the end of their wits about this.
[03:02:17.399 --> 03:02:19.501]  The morale is in the toilet.
[03:02:19.501 --> 03:02:29.470]  What about they've got jihadis that openly say they want to kill gays and murder people, you know, on video, to Tommy Robinson, and then they put them in a lavish flat, because I know how much stuff costs in London.
[03:02:30.467 --> 03:02:42.809]  With police protection and police cameras, and they're housing thousands of them for their own protection, right next to an elementary school, and the back fence in his backyard, in his garden, is to the playground.
[03:02:44.375 --> 03:02:44.695]  Oh, no.
[03:02:44.695 --> 03:02:46.677]  I mean, they're flaunting it now, Alex.
[03:02:46.677 --> 03:02:48.338]  You saw the guy just there in the clip.
[03:02:48.338 --> 03:02:59.248]  He was in the same Channel 4 documentary as one of the London Bridge attackers, basically laughing sardonically when they said, well, your views are exactly... And he looks like a total wimp!
[03:02:59.248 --> 03:03:00.989]  He looks like a total wimp!
[03:03:00.989 --> 03:03:01.850]  I just can't believe this.
[03:03:03.226 --> 03:03:06.909]  And they're in a documentary called The Jihadis Next Door.
[03:03:06.909 --> 03:03:10.553]  Being jihadis, the police knew about them.
[03:03:10.553 --> 03:03:12.955]  They say, oh, we don't know, they were planning an attack.
[03:03:12.955 --> 03:03:14.196]  This is the situation, Alex.
[03:03:14.196 --> 03:03:19.801]  There's at least 3,000 of these people, another 20,000 potential terrorists.
[03:03:19.801 --> 03:03:22.543]  It takes dozens of cops to monitor them 24-7.
[03:03:22.543 --> 03:03:23.264]  They can't do it.
[03:03:24.605 --> 03:03:26.367]  We can't lock them up.
[03:03:26.367 --> 03:03:30.610]  They're allowing them back in from Syria, from Iraq, to attack us.
[03:03:30.610 --> 03:03:35.234]  The Manchester bomber came back in from Libya, and it's just an absolute joke.
[03:03:35.234 --> 03:03:41.079]  And what's crazy is thousands of them, as the police have said, won't even deny they fought for ISIS or Al-Qaeda.
[03:03:41.079 --> 03:03:44.202]  Won't deny their families, won't deny they want to kill people.
[03:03:44.202 --> 03:03:47.865]  It's like, okay, you just said you want to kill people and you fought for ISIS.
[03:03:47.865 --> 03:03:49.246]  We're going to euthanize you.
[03:03:49.246 --> 03:03:50.968]  I mean, you're admitting it.
[03:03:50.968 --> 03:03:51.949]  They need to be euthanized.
[03:03:53.634 --> 03:03:59.178]  Instead, they give them free housing and benefits and situate them one minute away from a school, Alex.
[03:03:59.178 --> 03:04:02.120]  Notice I said euthanized because these aren't people, these are animals.
[03:04:03.939 --> 03:04:16.523]  And you have Sadiq Khan today, the Islamist mayor of London, who defended actual Al-Qaeda members in the past, that said that moderate Muslims are Uncle Toms, literally, you know, while letting in terrorists from Syria.
[03:04:16.523 --> 03:04:18.824]  He's calling for Trump to be banned.
[03:04:18.824 --> 03:04:29.447]  This is the guy who, you know, demanded that Louis Farrakhan, who has described Jews as bloodsuckers and called Hitler a very great man, he says that Farrakhan should be allowed to enter the UK.
[03:04:30.703 --> 03:04:33.604]  Well, I'll say this, Farrakhan has moderated to a great extent.
[03:04:33.604 --> 03:04:39.305]  I just want to have peace, and I think he could be the guy, he's trying to get Islam to actually back down now, but I know he did say some of that wilder stuff in his youth.
[03:04:39.305 --> 03:04:41.725]  I'm not defending it, but you're right.
[03:04:41.725 --> 03:04:43.946]  Paul Watson takes over from France.
[03:04:43.946 --> 03:04:45.466]  He's over there investigating right now.
[03:04:45.466 --> 03:04:47.426]  We'll be back on the other side with Paul Watson.
[03:04:47.426 --> 03:04:51.347]  Don't forget, BioTruth Selenium, the purest out there in super high quality.

[03:04:59.969 --> 03:05:00.750]  Back to Paul Watson.
[03:05:19.226 --> 03:05:29.970]  She also defended London Mayor Sidi Kahn, the man who once represented 9-11 Al-Qaeda member Zacharias Moussaoui, called moderate Muslims Uncle Tom's, and said terrorism was part and parcel to living in a major city.
[03:05:29.970 --> 03:05:32.631]  And she added, Kahn has shown steady, determined leadership.
[03:05:32.631 --> 03:05:35.352]  Hillary said the best way to combating terror is to reach out to the world.
[03:05:35.452 --> 03:05:35.632]  Okay, okay.
[03:05:59.830 --> 03:06:03.151]  Rob, you're reporting for InfoWars Nightly News and InfoWars.com.
[03:06:03.151 --> 03:06:13.756]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[03:06:13.756 --> 03:06:15.817]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[03:06:15.817 --> 03:06:18.678]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[03:06:18.678 --> 03:06:20.178]  It's made in the USA.
[03:06:20.178 --> 03:06:27.001]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the InfoWars.
[03:06:27.001 --> 03:06:28.262]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[03:06:29.062 --> 03:06:38.765]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[03:06:38.765 --> 03:06:48.348]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.
[03:06:48.348 --> 03:06:55.590]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brushfires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[03:06:55.590 --> 03:06:58.751]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[03:06:58.871 --> 03:07:03.037]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield at Infowarslife.com.
[03:07:03.037 --> 03:07:04.419]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[03:07:38.928 --> 03:07:43.373]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[03:07:43.373 --> 03:07:45.435]  And this part is most important.
[03:07:45.435 --> 03:07:52.262]  The ingredients in Vitamin Mineral Fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[03:07:52.262 --> 03:07:53.683]  That means it's clean.
[03:07:53.683 --> 03:07:54.824]  That means it's pure.
[03:07:54.824 --> 03:07:57.727]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[03:07:57.727 --> 03:08:00.510]  That's InfoWarsLife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[03:08:00.510 --> 03:08:02.152]  Take action now before we sell out.
[03:08:06.565 --> 03:08:08.828]  Broadcasting live from the U.N.
[03:08:08.828 --> 03:08:15.157]  stronghold, Austin, Texas, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:15.157 --> 03:08:18.862]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:08:22.452 --> 03:08:30.355]  CNN, the counterfeit news network, has been caught stage managing a scene and then presenting it as if it were news on their fake news network.
[03:08:30.355 --> 03:08:45.681]  So what's happening here is this is right outside the scene of the latest terrorist attack that happened in London over the weekend and this is CNN and their reporter Becky Anderson stage managing a small group of Muslims who are carrying signs that are denouncing the terrorist attack.
[03:08:46.161 --> 03:08:57.873]  And this is a clear violation of journalistic ethics because journalists are not supposed to be involved in what's called stage managing to manipulate scenes that are then presented as news.
[03:08:57.873 --> 03:09:08.665]  You can see that the small group was allowed past the police line and the CNN crew here is literally directing them, helping them get framed properly for their shot.
[03:09:08.925 --> 03:09:14.290]  Of course, this footage was shot by a bystander and posted on Twitter at Mark Antro.
[03:09:14.290 --> 03:09:18.293]  And this is what the viewers at home were presented as to what happened.
[03:09:18.293 --> 03:09:22.477]  But of course, those who were there in person saw something totally different.
[03:09:22.477 --> 03:09:29.043]  Look at this, here you can see one of the CNN producers wearing their headphones telling them, no, no, no, move over a little bit more to your left.
[03:09:29.043 --> 03:09:34.808]  Then once the shot was framed up the way that they wanted to present it, then the CNN reporter began her piece.
[03:09:35.168 --> 03:09:40.532]  Those are bystanders laughing and they said this is embarrassing.
[03:10:01.135 --> 03:10:14.303]  Now if you're thinking that this isn't really a big deal, as long as those protesters weren't like paid actors, let me just point out to you from The Ethical Journalist, Making Responsible Decisions in the Digital Age, a book by Gene Forman.
[03:10:14.303 --> 03:10:22.689]  He writes, most print photojournalists, and let me add video journalists, reject the stage managing of news photographs, or news broadcasts.
[03:10:22.689 --> 03:10:27.392]  That is, directing the people being photographed to do something for the benefit of the camera.
[03:10:27.952 --> 03:10:35.034]  These photojournalists argue that a posed photograph cannot ethically be presented as a found moment.
[03:10:35.034 --> 03:10:40.355]  A noteworthy example of stage managing occurred in the Los Angeles Times in 1993.
[03:10:40.355 --> 03:10:48.838]  While covering a fire scene, a Times photographer, Mike Meadows, suggested that a firefighter go to a swimming pool and pour water over his head to cool off.
[03:10:49.298 --> 03:10:51.479]  The result was a stunning photograph.
[03:10:51.479 --> 03:11:00.403]  But when the photo director, Larry Armstrong, discovered the circumstances in which the photo had been taken, he suspended Meadows.
[03:11:00.403 --> 03:11:06.406]  When you manipulate the situation, Armstrong said, you manipulate the news.
[03:11:06.406 --> 03:11:10.728]  Even the Washington Compost denounced the stage managing of that photo.
[03:11:10.728 --> 03:11:13.729]  Here's an old 1994 article about it.
[03:11:13.729 --> 03:11:16.771]  LA Times gets burned by disaster photograph.
[03:11:17.131 --> 03:11:29.594]  In a riveting picture carried by newspapers and magazines nationwide last fall, a Los Angeles firefighter doused his head with water from a backyard swimming pool while the luxury home behind him was consumed by a spectacular blaze.
[03:11:29.594 --> 03:11:38.036]  The Los Angeles Times, which was preparing to enter the photo for a Pulitzer Prize, now says it was staged by one of the paper's veteran photographers.
[03:11:38.036 --> 03:11:45.998]  The Times has suspended staffer Mike Meadows without pay for one week and canceled plans to enter the picture in all prize competitions.
[03:11:46.158 --> 03:11:50.984]  Larry Armstrong, the paper's director of photography, called the picture a, quote, fabrication.
[03:11:50.984 --> 03:11:53.066]  We regard it as extremely serious, he said.
[03:11:53.066 --> 03:11:54.788]  This is a firing offense.
[03:11:54.788 --> 03:11:59.354]  When you manipulate the situation, you manipulate the news.
[03:11:59.354 --> 03:12:03.579]  This is similar to when ABC News was recently captured staging a crime scene.
[03:12:03.959 --> 03:12:08.601]  So they could appear that they were doing a news report from right where the crime was committed.
[03:12:08.601 --> 03:12:13.783]  This is what viewers at home saw with the police line there just blowing in the wind.
[03:12:13.783 --> 03:12:22.227]  But of course, just like this recent example with CNN, there were people that were gathered around to watch the people reporting on the news.
[03:12:22.907 --> 03:12:26.689]  And people were taking photographs of what was actually happening.
[03:12:26.689 --> 03:12:38.953]  And on social media, we found this photo, which clearly shows that the producers tied the fake crime scene tape themselves on two different tripods.
[03:12:38.953 --> 03:12:46.396]  Of course, these are blatant violations of journalistic ethics, but since CNN and ABC News aren't really journalists, I guess they just don't care.
[03:12:46.396 --> 03:12:47.156]  I'm Mark Dice.
[03:12:47.156 --> 03:12:47.997]  Thanks for watching.
[03:12:47.997 --> 03:12:50.878]  Subscribe to my channel if you're new and check back here every day for new reports.
[03:12:51.418 --> 03:12:57.783]  Talking about CNN faking that Muslim anti-terror protest a couple of days ago.
[03:12:57.783 --> 03:13:08.190]  Again, the question I put to CNN, if Tommy Robinson or someone of his ilk was staging an anti-sharia law protest, would the police let him through a cordon?
[03:13:08.670 --> 03:13:14.574]  Would they situate Muslim police officers next to him to give his message more credibility?
[03:13:14.574 --> 03:13:22.839]  Would CNN carefully set up the shot so it's perfect, so they can gush about it, so they can genuflect about it?
[03:13:22.839 --> 03:13:24.780]  No, no, and no.
[03:13:24.780 --> 03:13:26.801]  They wouldn't do any of those things.
[03:13:26.801 --> 03:13:30.083]  They wouldn't even give his protest any attention.
[03:13:30.083 --> 03:13:37.948]  And if they did, it would be to criticize it, it would be to attack it, it would be to smear Tommy Robinson as an Islamophobe.
[03:13:38.388 --> 03:13:42.090]  That's what CNN would do under such a scenario.
[03:13:42.090 --> 03:13:49.053]  Of course, in this scenario, they carefully staged that protest, whether the protesters were organic, aware of it or not.
[03:13:49.053 --> 03:13:55.056]  This was clearly done to push a narrative, and they're culpable for staging fake news.
[03:13:55.056 --> 03:13:57.577]  So their denial was completely pathetic.
[03:13:58.297 --> 03:14:02.942]  They would have only behaved that way under those exact circumstances.
[03:14:02.942 --> 03:14:05.905]  That is manipulating the viewing public.
[03:14:05.905 --> 03:14:08.268]  That's what CNN are experts at doing.
[03:14:08.268 --> 03:14:10.410]  So again, their denial makes no sense.
[03:14:10.410 --> 03:14:13.153]  It has zero credibility.
[03:14:13.153 --> 03:14:20.500]  Just as the Mayor of London has zero credibility, Fox News reports London Mayor Corn suggests calling off Trump's state visit to Britain.
[03:14:21.229 --> 03:14:22.630]  Not the first time he's done it.
[03:14:22.630 --> 03:14:31.378]  London Mayor Sadiq Khan escalated his war of words with President Trump late Monday, suggesting the US President's planned state visits to Britain should be cancelled.
[03:14:31.378 --> 03:14:38.164]  Speaking on Channel 4 News, Khan said Britain should not be rolling out the red carpet to the President of the USA in the circumstances.
[03:14:38.164 --> 03:14:39.505]  What are the circumstances?
[03:14:39.505 --> 03:14:45.451]  Well, Khan got triggered by a few Trump tweets calling him out as being weak on terrorism.
[03:14:46.684 --> 03:14:53.987]  But Sadiq Khan is more upset over those tweets than the fact that we're actually letting real terrorists back into the UK.
[03:14:53.987 --> 03:14:55.748]  Oh no, they're not the problem.
[03:14:55.748 --> 03:15:09.455]  The ISIS jihadists leaving the country and coming back in from Syria and Iraq, which the UK government has failed to do anything about, won't deport them, won't take their passports away if they're British citizens.
[03:15:09.455 --> 03:15:10.835]  No, they're not the problem.
[03:15:10.835 --> 03:15:12.876]  Donald Trump is the problem.
[03:15:12.876 --> 03:15:14.037]  He's the extremist.
[03:15:15.100 --> 03:15:21.897]  And it's no surprise given that this is a guy who defended the 9-11 Al-Qaeda conspirator.
[03:15:22.799 --> 03:15:45.486]  Zacarias Moussaoui, back, what was it now, at least 10-15 years ago, it was a few years after 9-11, defended an Al-Qaeda terrorist, demanded Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader, who's previously described Jews as bloodsuckers and called Hitler a very great man, demanded he be allowed to enter the UK.
[03:15:45.486 --> 03:15:47.647]  But Donald Trump can't enter the UK.
[03:15:48.652 --> 03:15:58.979]  Now don't get me wrong, as long as somebody's not a physical violent danger, I don't think anyone should be barred from entering the country simply because of their opinions.
[03:15:58.979 --> 03:16:02.181]  Like, Michael Savage is barred from entering the country.
[03:16:02.181 --> 03:16:06.564]  Like, Richard Spencer, love him or hate him, is banned from entering the UK.
[03:16:06.564 --> 03:16:09.706]  No, don't ban someone based on their opinions.
[03:16:09.706 --> 03:16:13.569]  If they're an actual terrorist threat, then yes, ban them.
[03:16:13.569 --> 03:16:18.232]  If they're Donald Trump, the president of the free world, no, don't ban them.
[03:16:18.932 --> 03:16:21.053]  Absolutely insane.
[03:16:21.053 --> 03:16:27.817]  There's an article out of DC Whispers which really crystallizes the Islamist nature of Sadiq Khan.
[03:16:27.817 --> 03:16:40.224]  It says, in 2004, Khan defended the radical Muslim scholar Yusuf al-Qaradawi, who Khan argued was being unfairly portrayed as an extremist by political conservatives in England.
[03:16:40.224 --> 03:16:45.386]  And yet al-Qaradawi authored the book, The Lawful and Prohibited in Islam.
[03:16:45.386 --> 03:16:45.987]  Listen to this.
[03:16:46.607 --> 03:16:56.716]  Which advocates for the subjugation of women and applauds and condones suicide bombings against Israel, which he considers to be God's justice.
[03:16:56.716 --> 03:16:58.959]  That's the real Al-Qaidawi.
[03:16:58.959 --> 03:17:05.284]  The man Sadiq Khan says is not an extremist, but Donald Trump is an extremist.
[03:17:06.238 --> 03:17:14.324]  Sadiq Khan, the same guy who in a 2009 interview said that moderate Muslims are, quote, Uncle Toms.
[03:17:14.324 --> 03:17:25.012]  The same guy that appeared on a stage with ISIS sympathisers at least nine times during his campaign to become London Mayor.
[03:17:25.012 --> 03:17:31.557]  He again defended the 9-11 terrorist Zakarious Moussaoui, the Al-Qaeda conspirator.
[03:17:31.557 --> 03:17:33.298]  The DC Whispers article goes on.
[03:17:34.451 --> 03:17:43.380]  Please ask yourself how it is that an anti-Semite who is now telling Londoners that Islamist terror attacks should be accepted as a way of life for them.
[03:17:43.380 --> 03:17:44.461]  Don't forget that, he said.
[03:17:44.461 --> 03:17:49.646]  Terror in major cities was a part and parcel of life, which by the way is...
[03:17:51.348 --> 03:17:58.335]  A method by which Islamists, by which jihadists use to encourage submission and capitulation.
[03:17:58.335 --> 03:18:06.122]  Now our own Mayor of London is doing their bidding for them by telling Londoners to just get used to it.
[03:18:06.122 --> 03:18:09.445]  And just yesterday, this is out of westmonster.com,
[03:18:10.686 --> 03:18:13.569]  He again shared a platform with an Islamist.
[03:18:13.569 --> 03:18:25.678]  Senior politicians drew criticism last night after inviting a representative from the Muslim Council of Britain to share a platform with them following the London Bridge attacks.
[03:18:25.678 --> 03:18:34.386]  They were criticised by leading Muslim reformists including Majid Nawaz for sharing a platform with Haroon Khan, Secretary General of the Muslim Council of Britain.
[03:18:35.336 --> 03:18:42.541]  This guy is an advocate of the caliphate, just like Isis is.
[03:18:42.541 --> 03:18:44.103]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:18:44.103 --> 03:18:55.851]  The Mayor of London saying that Donald Trump should de facto be banned from visiting the UK, should not have a state visit, while he's literally defending actual terrorists.
[03:18:55.851 --> 03:19:02.056]  While he's saying that people who say Hitler was great, who say Jews are bloodsuckers, they should be allowed to enter the UK.
[03:19:03.377 --> 03:19:05.458]  And I agree, I'm a free speech purist.
[03:19:05.458 --> 03:19:09.479]  I think they should, as long as they don't pose a physical danger to anyone.
[03:19:09.479 --> 03:19:11.780]  They should be allowed to enter the UK.
[03:19:11.780 --> 03:19:23.364]  But the fact he defends them and advocates that they be allowed to enter, while saying Donald Trump's state visit shouldn't happen, tells you everything you need to know about Sadiq Khan.
[03:19:23.364 --> 03:19:26.685]  And I'll be doing a video about him probably tonight or tomorrow.
[03:19:28.410 --> 03:19:33.815]  London Bridge terrorist was allowed to work at Westminster Station despite known jihadist views.
[03:19:33.815 --> 03:19:38.319]  We're finding out more and more about the three individuals responsible for the attack.
[03:19:38.319 --> 03:19:48.548]  Khurram Shahzad Butt, one of the three London Bridge attackers, was allowed to work at Westminster Tube Station even after he featured in a TV documentary about British jihadists.
[03:19:48.548 --> 03:19:50.009]  He was in the documentary.
[03:19:50.009 --> 03:19:51.370]  It was being flaunted.
[03:19:52.111 --> 03:19:57.857]  He was allowed to work in a tube station directly under Parliament.
[03:19:57.857 --> 03:19:58.758]  Incredible!
[03:19:58.758 --> 03:20:02.422]  We'll be back with the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show live in 4Wars.com.
[03:20:09.690 --> 03:20:11.130]  The symptoms are there.

[03:24:17.835 --> 03:24:29.172]  Before I jump back into the news, I want to tell you about the great products available at InfoWars.com because your support has never been more needed than it is right now.
[03:24:29.172 --> 03:24:30.554]  Did you hear about Breitbart?
[03:24:31.499 --> 03:24:37.187]  Now, of course, we're fans of Breitbart here, but they've got a 90% deficit on their advertising.
[03:24:37.187 --> 03:24:43.315]  They've lost about 90% of their advertisers in the last six months or so alone.
[03:24:43.315 --> 03:24:44.777]  Absolutely amazing.
[03:24:44.777 --> 03:24:48.062]  Of course, thanks to the boycotts by the intolerant left.
[03:24:49.278 --> 03:25:14.958]  They're really in the toilet as far as advertising is concerned and one good thing about InfoWars is that we're not nearly as dependent on outside advertisers because of course we've got the products in-house and we rely on you, our listeners, for support, not third-party advertisers that can be bullied and intimidated out of advertising with us by left-wing outrage mobs.
[03:25:16.380 --> 03:25:29.167]  So we really appreciate the support you've given us so far and we continue to invite you to visit InfoWarsLife.com where we currently have the new Z-Shield Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support Formula for 25% off retail.
[03:25:31.488 --> 03:25:35.751]  This is the proprietary toxic metal and chemical defence support formula.
[03:25:35.751 --> 03:25:40.615]  It's available at infowarslife.com in a very limited first run.
[03:25:40.615 --> 03:25:42.296]  It's not going to stick around for long.
[03:25:42.296 --> 03:25:49.562]  Countless studies show that our food, water and air is loaded with toxic metals and chemicals that are known to be wreaking havoc on our bodies.
[03:25:50.342 --> 03:26:03.351]  Even the EPA has admitted that more than 800 million pounds of pesticide is dumped in the US every year and 80% of these pesticides are used on crops and that's just the tip of the iceberg.
[03:26:03.351 --> 03:26:05.192]  So we have this great product formulated
[03:26:06.013 --> 03:26:16.003]  Alongside our team of doctors, PhD herbalists and chemists who have spent years developing and testing the proprietary technology used to create Z-Shield.
[03:26:16.003 --> 03:26:17.585]  It's a game-changing formula.
[03:26:17.585 --> 03:26:29.477]  It contains the organic ingredients known to help support the body in the fight against toxic metals and chemicals like cilantro, shillap, milk thistle and super concentrated zeolites.
[03:26:30.037 --> 03:26:32.098]  This is a first-time limited run, though.
[03:26:32.098 --> 03:26:33.579]  It's not going to stick around for long.
[03:26:33.579 --> 03:26:38.102]  We have it 25% off retail at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:26:38.102 --> 03:26:39.663]  Get it today.
[03:26:39.663 --> 03:26:42.525]  Support the growth of this network.
[03:26:42.525 --> 03:26:45.727]  We really appreciate you doing so, so far.
[03:26:45.727 --> 03:26:48.589]  And that's how we've been able to survive and thrive, because again,
[03:26:49.522 --> 03:26:59.608]  We're not at the whim of left-wing outrage mobs that could take down, intimidate, bully third-party advertisers out of advertising bidders.
[03:26:59.608 --> 03:27:02.850]  We're only dependent on you.
[03:27:02.850 --> 03:27:06.852]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com.
[03:27:06.852 --> 03:27:15.578]  Now, in case you've been living under a rock for the past few days, the United Kingdom has been hit with three major terror attacks in less than three months.
[03:27:16.479 --> 03:27:20.423]  And what are authorities seemingly most concerned about in some cases?
[03:27:20.423 --> 03:27:32.357]  Well, Cheshire Police put out a Facebook post saying, quote, we would remind all social media users to think carefully about what they are saying before posting messages online.
[03:27:32.357 --> 03:27:34.899]  Although you may believe your message is acceptable.
[03:27:35.640 --> 03:27:39.261]  You may believe you're not committing a thought crime.
[03:27:39.261 --> 03:27:42.202]  Other people may take offence.
[03:27:42.202 --> 03:27:49.384]  And you could face a large fine or up to two years in prison if your message is deemed to have broken the law.
[03:27:49.384 --> 03:28:02.548]  So now you have an actual police department in the United Kingdom, in the light of these terror attacks, telling people that causing offence could land them in jail for two years.
[03:28:02.548 --> 03:28:03.609]  Let that sink in.
[03:28:04.574 --> 03:28:09.680]  Of course, they could be concerned with catching actual criminals and terrorists, but no.
[03:28:09.680 --> 03:28:13.605]  They're more concerned with regulating your free speech on Facebook.
[03:28:14.875 --> 03:28:22.182]  They're more concerned with identifying 15-year-old UKIP supporters as terrorists.
[03:28:22.182 --> 03:28:24.263]  Yes, that actually happened.
[03:28:24.263 --> 03:28:34.032]  Breitbart reports teachers report 15-year-old boy to government extremism watchdog for jokes about Caitlyn Jenner and campaigning for UKIP.
[03:28:34.032 --> 03:28:38.696]  Now bear in mind that Salford University, attended by the Manchester bomber,
[03:28:39.727 --> 03:28:44.053]  ...campaigned against the government's Prevent Terrorism program.
[03:28:44.053 --> 03:28:49.120]  So they actually rallied against a program designed to identify terrorists.
[03:28:50.626 --> 03:28:54.487]  And who are people on the left identifying as terrorists?
[03:28:54.487 --> 03:28:55.767]  Islamist extremists?
[03:28:55.767 --> 03:28:55.967]  No.
[03:28:55.967 --> 03:28:59.988]  15-year-old members of UKIP.
[03:28:59.988 --> 03:29:01.528]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:29:01.528 --> 03:29:20.072]  Michael Higginson, a 15-year-old student at Vision Studio School in Mansfield, says that his teachers who openly backed the Labour Party, the far-left party here in Britain, actually reported him to authorities as a potential terrorist because he's a UKIP supporter.
[03:29:21.055 --> 03:29:25.296]  The third biggest political party in Britain.
[03:29:25.296 --> 03:29:26.877]  He talks about immigration.
[03:29:26.877 --> 03:29:30.638]  He talks about supporting Marine Le Pen in France.
[03:29:30.638 --> 03:29:34.459]  He, God forbid, made a joke about Caitlyn Jenner.
[03:29:34.459 --> 03:29:41.482]  And now he's been identified, or at least reported, as a terrorist.
[03:29:41.482 --> 03:29:42.862]  Let that sink in.
[03:29:42.862 --> 03:29:43.902]  We'll be back.
[03:29:43.902 --> 03:29:46.403]  It's the Alex Jones Show live, fourth hour.
[03:29:46.403 --> 03:29:48.244]  BreakingNewsAtInfoWars.com.
[03:29:48.244 --> 03:29:48.864]  Don't go away.
[03:29:51.107 --> 03:29:55.028]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.028 --> 03:30:02.450]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:02.450 --> 03:30:11.833]  You might think the best ways to stop terrorism is maybe extreme vetting, not allowing unvetted refugees into your home, maybe not trying to do so many regime changes in Middle Eastern countries.
[03:30:11.833 --> 03:30:13.333]  Well, you're all wrong.
[03:30:13.333 --> 03:30:18.735]  In fact, Hillary Clinton says a way to stop terrorism is to understand other cultures and their food.
[03:30:18.735 --> 03:30:19.195]  Yes, really.
[03:30:19.315 --> 03:30:30.058]  She also defended London Mayor Siti Khan, the man who once represented 9-11 Al-Qaeda member Zacharias Moussaoui, called moderate Muslims Uncle Toms, and said terrorism was part and parcel to living in a major city.
[03:30:30.058 --> 03:30:32.719]  And she added, Khan has shown steady, determined leadership.
[03:30:32.719 --> 03:30:35.420]  Hillary said the best way to combating terror is to reach out to the world.
[03:30:35.520 --> 03:30:42.703]  In order to understand people living in foreign countries, getting to know one another, learning about the experiences, the lives, the cultures, the religions, the food.
[03:30:42.703 --> 03:30:47.145]  So does this mean we gotta be like into stoning women, cutting off their genitals, and throwing gays off buildings?
[03:30:47.145 --> 03:30:52.167]  This is not a time to lash out, to incite fear, to use tragedy and terror for political gain, said Clinton.
[03:30:52.167 --> 03:30:59.931]  A comment obviously aimed at Donald Trump, and anyone else who has correctly identified political correctness and tolerance of Islam as creating a fertile ground for terrorist attacks in the Western world.
[03:30:59.931 --> 03:31:02.792]  Rob Dewar reporting for InfoWars Nightly News and InfoWars.com.
[03:31:03.152 --> 03:31:12.243]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[03:31:12.243 --> 03:31:20.332]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:31:20.632 --> 03:31:25.496]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[03:31:25.496 --> 03:31:32.301]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[03:31:32.301 --> 03:31:39.487]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[03:31:39.487 --> 03:31:46.512]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[03:31:46.512 --> 03:31:50.435]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[03:31:50.495 --> 03:32:08.669]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue Fluoride Toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:32:08.669 --> 03:32:10.771]  Research across the board is clear.
[03:32:10.771 --> 03:32:16.055]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[03:32:16.055 --> 03:32:19.818]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants that
[03:32:19.898 --> 03:32:23.341]  Your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[03:32:23.341 --> 03:32:26.503]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[03:32:26.503 --> 03:32:30.407]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[03:32:30.407 --> 03:32:37.572]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[03:32:37.572 --> 03:32:42.957]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil,
[03:32:43.217 --> 03:32:45.278]  Iodine, nano, silver, and more.
[03:32:45.278 --> 03:32:53.560]  Due to requests from listeners who found that Spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children, we have created the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue that is Spearmint free.
[03:32:53.560 --> 03:33:01.882]  Learn more about the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue toothpaste and more at InfoWarsLife.com and support the Info War while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[03:33:04.660 --> 03:33:11.686]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:11.686 --> 03:33:17.210]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:33:17.210 --> 03:33:28.599]  We are back, hosting The Alex Jones Show fourth hour from somewhere up a mountain in occupied France.
[03:33:28.599 --> 03:33:33.744]  Former site of the French Resistance, who actually occupied this house that I'm living in.
[03:33:34.525 --> 03:33:40.994]  Not much resistance going on in France anymore, is there, after the election of the globalist Emmanuel Macron?
[03:33:42.401 --> 03:33:45.522]  Now who says that the left is soft on terrorism?
[03:33:45.522 --> 03:33:52.005]  Because they're outing the real threat, which is 15-year-old UKIP activists.
[03:33:52.005 --> 03:33:56.966]  I'm going to read this whole story because it's absolutely jaw-dropping.
[03:33:56.966 --> 03:34:08.771]  A member of UKIP's youth wing has been labelled far-right by his school and reported to the government's prevent de-radicalisation programme, which is designed to stop young people from being drawn into terrorism.
[03:34:09.671 --> 03:34:14.536]  An activist for the third biggest political party in Britain.
[03:34:14.536 --> 03:34:15.898]  Think about that for a second.
[03:34:15.898 --> 03:34:21.564]  Based on the 2015 election, UKIP is the third biggest political party in Britain.
[03:34:21.564 --> 03:34:26.690]  This 15-year-old student is an activist for UKIP.
[03:34:26.690 --> 03:34:31.255]  He's been reported to the government as a terrorist by his own school.
[03:34:32.895 --> 03:34:46.642]  He told Breitbart London the school's safeguarding officer told him he could have committed a hate crime and that they needed to find out if he was an extremist before he was subsequently interviewed by two police officers.
[03:34:46.642 --> 03:34:50.124]  They actually sent cops to the school because he supports UKIP.
[03:34:51.249 --> 03:34:56.753]  A student said he is vocal in his support for UKIP in citizenship lessons.
[03:34:56.753 --> 03:35:01.796]  God forbid he wants immigrants coming into the country to actually be able to speak English.
[03:35:01.796 --> 03:35:04.638]  That must mean he's an extremist, right?
[03:35:04.638 --> 03:35:13.723]  And has tweeted approvingly about right-wing French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen, who about 40% of the French people supported.
[03:35:13.723 --> 03:35:16.505]  Can't support her, you're an extremist.
[03:35:16.505 --> 03:35:19.207]  He claims there were two reasons for his referral to prevent
[03:35:20.325 --> 03:35:26.567]  Again, to remind you, Prevent is the government program that identifies terrorists.
[03:35:26.567 --> 03:35:27.828]  So why did they report him?
[03:35:27.828 --> 03:35:33.349]  Well, he told a mildly politically incorrect joke about transgendered celebrity Caitlyn Jenner.
[03:35:33.349 --> 03:35:34.270]  Can't do that.
[03:35:34.270 --> 03:35:35.990]  That means you're a terrorist.
[03:35:35.990 --> 03:35:37.991]  Which he admitted was crude.
[03:35:37.991 --> 03:35:40.372]  He had also brought UKIP leaflets into school.
[03:35:41.235 --> 03:35:54.427]  Oh my God, he actually brought terrorist propaganda UKIP leaflets into school, which he handed out after lessons, or at least intended to, when campaigning for the local elections.
[03:35:54.427 --> 03:36:01.032]  The literature which remained in sealed bags was confiscated, and he was told he could only retrieve it with a parent or guardian.
[03:36:02.585 --> 03:36:04.085]  Oh God!
[03:36:04.085 --> 03:36:13.308]  The school also allegedly tracked Mr. Higginson's internet search history and claimed he had viewed the Britain First website.
[03:36:13.308 --> 03:36:19.570]  Again, hate speech, terrorism, can't look at a website, even though he denies viewing it.
[03:36:19.570 --> 03:36:26.232]  After the allegations surfaced, he said teachers told him he was not allowed to discuss his opinions with other students in his free time.
[03:36:28.191 --> 03:36:35.077]  So they literally told him, you can't even talk about UKIP outside of school to your fellow students.
[03:36:35.077 --> 03:36:36.378]  That's hate speech.
[03:36:36.378 --> 03:36:38.901]  Again, third biggest political party in Britain.
[03:36:40.250 --> 03:36:51.936]  Quote, to tell me that I can't express any political opinions because it's a public building is complete contradiction because they, some teachers, back Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.
[03:36:51.936 --> 03:36:57.179]  He said the officers were friendly, had no concerns about his beliefs and did not appear to consider him a threat.
[03:36:57.179 --> 03:37:03.263]  However, they did question his views on immigration and the school has said he could face a follow-up meeting.
[03:37:04.448 --> 03:37:05.268]  That's right.
[03:37:05.268 --> 03:37:13.791]  You can't say that 300,000 plus immigrants net pouring into the UK every year might be a bit of a problem.
[03:37:13.791 --> 03:37:17.413]  That means you're an extremist.
[03:37:17.413 --> 03:37:26.596]  The school is not alone in reporting UKIP supporting pupils to authorities and it goes through previous examples where people viewed a UKIP website on a school computer
[03:37:27.938 --> 03:37:35.663]  Someone in Yorkshire was referred again to the Prevent Terrorist Program for opposing the burqa.
[03:37:35.663 --> 03:37:43.228]  So you can't say that women being covered in beekeepers outfits looks a little bit odd and might be a problem.
[03:37:43.228 --> 03:37:46.451]  With regards to criminal activity, no, you're an extremist.
[03:37:46.451 --> 03:37:48.712]  You're the terrorist.
[03:37:48.712 --> 03:37:56.998]  Following the killing of Joe Cox MP, police promised to refocus Prevent on the so-called far-right and a large and growing proportion of those targeted come from this group.
[03:37:58.670 --> 03:38:02.972]  Absolutely jaw-dropping insanity.
[03:38:02.972 --> 03:38:18.640]  Amidst three massive terrorist attacks in the last three months alone, under three months, this school is reporting a 15-year-old kid as a potential terrorist because he's handing out frigging UKIP leaflets.
[03:38:18.640 --> 03:38:21.241]  He's saying mass immigration's a problem.
[03:38:22.967 --> 03:38:25.569]  He's making a joke about Caitlyn Jenner.
[03:38:25.569 --> 03:38:27.910]  That means he's a terrorist.
[03:38:27.910 --> 03:38:31.032]  This is the mindset that pervades this country.
[03:38:31.032 --> 03:38:33.213]  Remember the story back from a few years ago?
[03:38:33.213 --> 03:38:35.555]  There was an immigrant couple.
[03:38:35.555 --> 03:38:37.076]  I think they were Polish.
[03:38:37.076 --> 03:38:38.597]  They weren't even British.
[03:38:38.597 --> 03:38:39.858]  They supported UKIP.
[03:38:40.632 --> 03:38:42.793]  They adopted children.
[03:38:42.793 --> 03:38:47.315]  By all accounts, extremely good parents, extremely caring parents.
[03:38:47.315 --> 03:38:49.176]  They adopted a baby.
[03:38:49.176 --> 03:39:08.144]  Social services in Rotherham, the scene of thirteen, what was it, thirteen hundred girls at least, being trafficked for years and years by Muslim rape gangs, authorities turned a blind eye because it would be politically incorrect to actually catch the paedophiles.
[03:39:09.861 --> 03:39:19.128]  They took the baby from these loving, caring foster parents because they supported UKIP.
[03:39:19.128 --> 03:39:22.350]  Can't support the third biggest political party in Britain.
[03:39:22.350 --> 03:39:24.431]  You'll have your children snatched.
[03:39:24.431 --> 03:39:27.734]  You'll be reported as a terrorist.
[03:39:27.734 --> 03:39:31.796]  That's the mindset dominating the United Kingdom right now.
[03:39:31.796 --> 03:39:32.257]  So is it...
[03:39:54.483 --> 03:39:58.189]  You can run on for a long time.
[03:39:58.189 --> 03:40:01.093]  Run on for a long time.
[03:40:01.093 --> 03:40:03.957]  Run on for a long time.
[03:40:03.957 --> 03:40:06.942]  Sooner or later gonna cut you down.
[03:40:06.942 --> 03:40:09.365]  Sooner or later gonna cut you down.
[03:40:11.565 --> 03:40:18.730]  Go tell that long-tongue liar, go and tell that... Six and a half million refugees the last five years into Europe and the UK.
[03:40:18.730 --> 03:40:24.933]  Do you ban everybody's free speech and have a big internet police force internationally to stop Islamic terror?
[03:40:24.933 --> 03:40:35.800]  Or do you stop bringing people in from the failed state of Libya, the failed state of Syria, the failed state of Iraq, the... Obviously, you stop bringing in the people that are doing the attacks.
[03:40:35.800 --> 03:40:37.941]  But let's go further.
[03:40:37.941 --> 03:40:40.123]  The EU, the United Nations,
[03:40:41.684 --> 03:40:50.731]  The different Soros funds that are openly funding the Arab Spring, that are openly funding and promoting all this jihadist garbage.
[03:40:50.731 --> 03:40:53.913]  They need to get in trouble for what they've done.
[03:40:53.913 --> 03:40:59.517]  And they need to stop financing the most radical forms of Islam to go around conquering the Middle East.
[03:40:59.517 --> 03:41:03.360]  It is a fact that there are a lot of America haters in this world.
[03:41:04.198 --> 03:41:20.970]  And it is a fact there are a lot of globalists that are trying to destroy the freedoms we have in the West, the middle class, and that they are allied with the most nasty, despicable, disgusting, murderous forms of orthodox Wahhabi Islam.
[03:41:20.970 --> 03:41:22.731]  Now you think about Europe.
[03:41:22.731 --> 03:41:32.959]  Five million military-age men, many of them off the battlefields of the Middle East, who kill each other in their own towns and cities, one-upping each other on who's the most Islamic.
[03:41:33.746 --> 03:41:42.189]  You bring in these radicalized people that are constantly competing with each other for who can be more backward.
[03:41:42.189 --> 03:41:50.632]  Then you have the left that's so busy apologizing for him and who's been embarrassing him so long, they will never say that they were in the wrong.
[03:41:50.632 --> 03:41:52.533]  So they'll never back off defending it.
[03:41:52.533 --> 03:41:57.055]  Or you've got major newspapers and major publications saying, let's not be mean to Muslims.
[03:41:58.061 --> 03:41:59.781]  Let's back off.
[03:41:59.781 --> 03:42:01.602]  Let's not say this is an Islamic attack.
[03:42:01.602 --> 03:42:06.603]  Remember, Obama would never call terror Islamic terror or radical Islamic terror.
[03:42:06.603 --> 03:42:08.783]  That's because of the whacked out Islamic ideology.
[03:42:08.783 --> 03:42:10.864]  It's not controlled by the globalists.
[03:42:10.864 --> 03:42:13.384]  It's just let in.
[03:42:13.384 --> 03:42:15.225]  The doors just opened.
[03:42:15.225 --> 03:42:22.306]  It hates liberals, gays, lesbians, rock and roll, pop music.
[03:42:22.306 --> 03:42:26.247]  They went and targeted a bunch of teenagers, you know, dressed up.
[03:42:27.867 --> 03:42:31.950]  In many cases, provocatively.
[03:42:31.950 --> 03:42:37.134]  Because that's what drives radical orthodox Islam up a wall.
[03:42:37.134 --> 03:42:40.476]  They kill women that go out dressed like that in public.
[03:42:40.476 --> 03:42:41.577]  They rape women.
[03:42:41.577 --> 03:42:47.441]  And if the woman complains, she's charged with adultery.
[03:42:47.441 --> 03:42:49.542]  She's charged with the sex crime.
[03:42:49.542 --> 03:42:50.363]  That's a fact.
[03:42:51.840 --> 03:42:59.463]  And then they bring in five million men, military age men, another million or so women and children.
[03:42:59.463 --> 03:43:04.645]  You watch the videos of thousands coming in, none of them are old men, none of them are old women.
[03:43:04.645 --> 03:43:06.546]  Because they're being sent on the jihad.
[03:43:06.546 --> 03:43:09.587]  There's what, five pillars of jihad?
[03:43:09.587 --> 03:43:12.728]  You've also got to go to Mecca at least once in life for the hajj?
[03:43:12.728 --> 03:43:17.710]  But bigger than the hajj is when the jihad comes, the physical jihad, you go forth.
[03:43:17.710 --> 03:43:21.272]  And ISIS said four years ago, ISIS
[03:43:22.483 --> 03:43:24.964]  Announces plans to use refugees to flood Europe.
[03:43:24.964 --> 03:43:29.567]  Type it in, you'll get InfoWars.com and Zero Hedge First from 2014.
[03:43:29.567 --> 03:43:32.989]  Four years ago, five years ago.
[03:43:32.989 --> 03:43:34.169]  There it is, that's September 8, 2015.
[03:43:34.169 --> 03:43:36.470]  That's one of the older ones.
[03:43:36.470 --> 03:43:42.934]  Flashback, ISIS threatens to send 500,000 migrants to Europe as psychological weapon.
[03:43:44.209 --> 03:43:48.578]  They go on to announce embedded within them are ISIS fighters.
[03:43:48.578 --> 03:43:50.341]  Now estimated 3,000 in England, 500 plots they've stopped.
[03:43:54.431 --> 03:43:55.311]  Or that are ongoing.
[03:43:55.311 --> 03:43:56.132]  That was last week.
[03:43:56.132 --> 03:43:58.853]  So, again, we're acting like this is a mystery.
[03:43:58.853 --> 03:44:17.343]  We said, you're bringing in people out of failed Syria, failed Libya, where our governments went, funded the revolutions to overthrow secular governments, in Egypt as well, that put radicals in charge that blow up every church, murder every Christian, kill every Jew, every Shiite, every non-radical Muslim, they can get their hands on.
[03:44:18.615 --> 03:44:28.281]  Taxpayers are paying to bring this in to create a clash of civilizations so that they can then say, they've got to regulate the internet, we've got to take free speech.
[03:44:28.281 --> 03:44:34.604]  So, you bring them in, they create the crisis, oh we've got to get rid of internet freedom now, something Soros openly said he wants.
[03:44:34.604 --> 03:44:36.706]  Oh, we've got to have an international group do it.
[03:44:36.706 --> 03:44:39.167]  Oh, we've got to take your rights away now.
[03:44:39.167 --> 03:44:41.028]  We've got to set up checkpoints on the highways.
[03:44:41.028 --> 03:44:43.710]  But we're going to bring in more of the Islamists.
[03:44:47.600 --> 03:45:10.156]  Live, it's the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show, hosted from this internet connection, which is basically two tin cans and a bit of string, because France is such a dreadful country in terms of economic activity, that when you try and buy a 4G connection, and it runs out of data after two days, you literally try and give them your money, and they say, no, we don't want your money.
[03:45:10.876 --> 03:45:12.558]  That's friends for you.
[03:45:12.558 --> 03:45:14.261]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:45:14.261 --> 03:45:17.545]  You literally try to pay them every two days.
[03:45:17.545 --> 03:45:18.927]  Here, take my money.
[03:45:18.927 --> 03:45:19.608]  Take my money.
[03:45:19.608 --> 03:45:20.449]  No.
[03:45:20.449 --> 03:45:21.530]  We don't want your money.
[03:45:21.530 --> 03:45:23.553]  No internet data for you.
[03:45:23.553 --> 03:45:24.374]  That's friends.
[03:45:24.374 --> 03:45:25.836]  That's why I'm leaving.
[03:45:25.836 --> 03:45:26.697]  But we were talking about...
[03:45:27.608 --> 03:45:35.792]  The 15-year-old UKIP activist I identified reported as a terrorist to the Government's Prevent Programme, so don't say the left is soft on terror.
[03:45:35.792 --> 03:45:44.037]  They're really hardcore on terror when it comes to, quote, right-wing extremists, which is basically anyone who has a different opinion.
[03:45:44.037 --> 03:45:50.340]  So you had a baby who was taken from a loving foster care couple because, again, they supported UKIP.
[03:45:51.218 --> 03:45:57.442]  Literally punishing people for their political opinions by snatching their kids and reporting them as terrorists.
[03:45:57.442 --> 03:45:59.604]  That's progressive!
[03:45:59.604 --> 03:46:05.228]  Breitbart reports Poland refusing to import Muslims is only proven counter-terror method.
[03:46:06.414 --> 03:46:12.298]  That's kind of interesting given that Breitbart just fired someone for basically saying the same thing in a tweet.
[03:46:12.298 --> 03:46:20.723]  They're now publishing this article which is from the, I think it's a minister there in Poland, the Law and Justice MEP.
[03:46:21.974 --> 03:46:28.275]  Who says, the only way to protect Poland from Islamic terror attacks is to not allow Muslims to migrate en masse.
[03:46:28.275 --> 03:46:37.057]  When it comes to reducing the chances of Poland being hit by Islamist terror attacks, the only proven method is to not allow in Muslim migrants.
[03:46:37.057 --> 03:46:45.359]  That's Ryszard Szynecki, who told local radio, after an attack on London, killed seven and injured 48 others.
[03:46:45.359 --> 03:46:47.240]  So he's basically out saying publicly,
[03:46:48.376 --> 03:46:57.883]  That the only surefire method of avoiding Islamist terror attacks is not to import huge numbers of Muslims into your country.
[03:46:57.883 --> 03:47:05.828]  Again, interesting given that Breitbart just fired a columnist for saying virtually that exact thing in a tweet.
[03:47:05.828 --> 03:47:09.671]  This was a report that went up on Infowars.com last night.
[03:47:09.671 --> 03:47:13.434]  Swedish women prove their tolerance by having sex with refugees.
[03:47:14.673 --> 03:47:23.240]  Swedish women are proving their tolerance, proving how progressive they are by having sex with refugee children who are actually grown adult men.
[03:47:23.240 --> 03:47:33.128]  Now of course the official government study in Sweden found that 75% or more of quote child refugees are actually adults.
[03:47:33.128 --> 03:47:35.650]  They did the medical tests and confirmed it.
[03:47:35.650 --> 03:47:41.175]  So now you have a spate of women in Sweden who are taking in migrants into their own homes
[03:47:42.301 --> 03:47:45.364]  Being asked to sleep with the migrants.
[03:47:45.364 --> 03:47:49.968]  This is a message that appeared on a left-wing blog called Blank Spot.
[03:47:49.968 --> 03:47:53.751]  So this is them admitting it on their own left-wing blogs.
[03:47:53.751 --> 03:47:59.757]  The woman who took in a migrant said, quote, from time to time, he gets to stay the night at my place.
[03:47:59.757 --> 03:48:05.242]  Adding, now the sofa doesn't work anymore, he gets to sleep with me in my bed.
[03:48:05.242 --> 03:48:06.042]  That's tolerance.
[03:48:07.054 --> 03:48:08.835]  I text a friend, help!
[03:48:08.835 --> 03:48:10.756]  I have to take him in my bed.
[03:48:10.756 --> 03:48:12.657]  She responds, we all do it, don't worry.
[03:48:12.657 --> 03:48:13.717]  That's how it is.
[03:48:13.717 --> 03:48:15.058]  Give him intimacy.
[03:48:15.058 --> 03:48:17.239]  That's all you can do.
[03:48:17.239 --> 03:48:20.100]  So it's literally got to the level.
[03:48:20.100 --> 03:48:29.104]  We featured the reports about this before, whether Calais volunteer charity workers there are literally prostitutes for migrants.
[03:48:29.104 --> 03:48:32.126]  And it's the other volunteers that blow the whistle on them.
[03:48:33.237 --> 03:48:42.540]  You had a founder of a charity, Care for Callie, who left her husband to go and have a relationship with a Tunisian migrant.
[03:48:42.540 --> 03:48:45.401]  So it's gone beyond virtue signalling now.
[03:48:45.401 --> 03:48:49.682]  It's gone off into some bizarre fetish world where these Swedish women
[03:48:50.580 --> 03:48:56.123]  Most of them in their 50s and 60s who are taking in these migrants, child refugees.
[03:48:56.123 --> 03:48:59.224]  They're actually literally 20 and 30 years old.
[03:48:59.224 --> 03:49:00.905]  They have full beards.
[03:49:00.905 --> 03:49:02.445]  Six foot two.
[03:49:02.445 --> 03:49:04.346]  You've seen the pictures.
[03:49:04.346 --> 03:49:06.347]  Taking them into their homes.
[03:49:06.347 --> 03:49:07.708]  They demand sex.
[03:49:09.312 --> 03:49:11.033]  The Swedish women are perplexed.
[03:49:11.033 --> 03:49:12.094]  Should I offer them sex?
[03:49:12.094 --> 03:49:14.835]  Should I allow myself to basically become a prostitute?
[03:49:14.835 --> 03:49:16.997]  They phone their friends, they say yes.
[03:49:16.997 --> 03:49:22.120]  That's the new tolerance, is having sex with migrants.
[03:49:22.120 --> 03:49:23.881]  This is who we're dealing with.
[03:49:23.881 --> 03:49:24.962]  This is the mindset.
[03:49:26.533 --> 03:49:31.456]  Gateway Pundit reports Melbourne Islamist killer was refugee from Somalia.
[03:49:31.456 --> 03:49:35.219]  Again, for about three hours they said, oh, I wonder if this is political.
[03:49:35.219 --> 03:49:37.720]  We just don't know if it's terror related.
[03:49:37.720 --> 03:49:42.143]  Even as he was screaming out his attack was for ISIS and Al-Qaeda.
[03:49:42.143 --> 03:49:47.006]  Kind of like during the Orlando attack where he literally told police, this is for ISIS.
[03:49:47.006 --> 03:49:52.510]  And still, over a year later, people claim it was about frigging gun control.
[03:49:54.434 --> 03:49:57.036]  So he said it was for ISIS and Al-Qaeda.
[03:49:57.036 --> 03:50:00.419]  Again, killed one man, injured three police officers.
[03:50:00.419 --> 03:50:02.841]  He was a refugee from Somalia.
[03:50:02.841 --> 03:50:08.825]  Isn't multiculturalism, isn't cultural enrichment working out just great?
[03:50:08.825 --> 03:50:14.330]  The third perpetrator of the London attack has been identified as Moroccan, Youssef Zagbar.
[03:50:16.374 --> 03:50:26.345]  Born in January 1995 in Morocco to a Moroccan father, last year he was stopped at the Bologna airport while trying to fly to Turkey to reach Syria.
[03:50:27.423 --> 03:50:33.589]  So, again, he was trying to get to Syria to join ISIS.
[03:50:33.589 --> 03:50:39.334]  The Italian authorities stopped him, despite the fact they're allowing in 200,000 migrants unvetted every year.
[03:50:39.334 --> 03:50:42.097]  Even they were intelligent enough to stop him.
[03:50:42.097 --> 03:50:44.559]  He's allowed to come back into Britain.
[03:50:44.559 --> 03:50:47.082]  They do absolutely nothing.
[03:50:47.742 --> 03:50:57.286]  Why are we allowing people into our country who are literally fighting alongside ISIS jihadists who go on to carry out deadly terrorist attacks?
[03:50:57.286 --> 03:50:58.746]  It's total insanity.
[03:50:58.746 --> 03:51:00.507]  Theresa May is doing nothing about it.
[03:51:00.507 --> 03:51:03.088]  We'll be back with the final segment in 4Wars.com.
[03:51:03.268 --> 03:51:04.389]  It really works.
[03:51:04.389 --> 03:51:06.590]  Just listen to what some people have to say.
[03:51:06.590 --> 03:51:10.192]  About six months ago, my wife bought the Xtend-a-Lite.
[03:51:10.192 --> 03:51:12.373]  She didn't tell me she was giving it to me.
[03:51:12.373 --> 03:51:16.796]  So after about three days, I said, you know, maybe the weather's changed or something.
[03:51:16.796 --> 03:51:18.797]  I said, my legs feel really good.
[03:51:18.797 --> 03:51:22.359]  And she goes, well, I've been giving you this stuff, and it was the Xtend-a-Lite.
[03:51:22.359 --> 03:51:25.961]  And you know that I'm about 75% better.
[03:51:25.961 --> 03:51:29.963]  I can actually climb stairs now, and I can get up out of chairs.
[03:51:29.963 --> 03:51:31.284]  I can even get down.
[03:51:31.944 --> 03:51:35.467]  ExtendoVite is only $69.95 for a 2 month supply of either capsules or liquid.
[03:51:35.467 --> 03:51:35.927]  Call now!
[03:51:35.927 --> 03:51:37.168]  That's 1-877-928-8822 or visit heartdrop.com.
[03:52:02.403 --> 03:52:03.804]  Let's go to Devin in Florida.
[03:52:03.804 --> 03:52:06.104]  Devin in Florida, you're on the air.
[03:52:06.104 --> 03:52:06.605]  Great!
[03:52:06.605 --> 03:52:07.725]  Hey, thank you so much.
[03:52:07.725 --> 03:52:12.067]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[03:52:12.067 --> 03:52:12.447]  Thank you.
[03:52:12.447 --> 03:52:14.107]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it.
[03:52:14.107 --> 03:52:21.850]  Because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret 12, Platinum Interfusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[03:52:21.850 --> 03:52:22.590]  Wow, thank you.
[03:52:22.590 --> 03:52:22.710]  Wow.
[03:52:22.710 --> 03:52:25.131]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[03:52:25.131 --> 03:52:26.712]  Which nutraceutical does he like best?
[03:52:26.972 --> 03:52:30.535]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[03:52:30.535 --> 03:52:30.956]  That's amazing.
[03:52:30.956 --> 03:52:31.837]  That's really incredible.
[03:52:31.837 --> 03:52:34.980]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[03:52:34.980 --> 03:52:36.361]  Like, I haven't fell asleep.
[03:52:36.361 --> 03:52:38.042]  My morning was fantastic.
[03:52:38.042 --> 03:52:39.223]  And I love you guys.
[03:52:39.223 --> 03:52:41.566]  I love the Info Wars crew.
[03:52:41.566 --> 03:52:48.552]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[03:52:48.552 --> 03:52:49.633]  You will love it.
[03:52:49.633 --> 03:52:50.154]  I'm telling you.
[03:52:50.154 --> 03:52:51.515]  I've never bought a bad product.
[03:52:51.795 --> 03:52:56.283]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at Infowarslife.com.

[03:54:02.509 --> 03:54:03.069]  Real life.
[03:54:18.149 --> 03:54:19.730]  Final segment of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:19.730 --> 03:54:24.273]  Again, I want to remind you about the great line of products at infowarsstore.com.
[03:54:24.273 --> 03:54:27.495]  We're not dependent on outside advertisers.
[03:54:27.495 --> 03:54:38.463]  That's why we're not subjected to, we're not prey to the outrage mobs that try and take down Sean Hannity's advertisers, that try and take down Brightbox advertisers.
[03:54:38.463 --> 03:54:47.369]  We're dependent only on you, our fantastic audience that has supported us through thick and thin for the best part of two decades.
[03:54:48.149 --> 03:54:54.212]  Now we have the Emerix Essentials line of organic household products at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:54:54.212 --> 03:55:01.795]  We have the Zinc Oxide Sunscreen, the Herbal Bug Spray, the Body Wash, the Shampoo, the Deodorant.
[03:55:01.795 --> 03:55:06.877]  Again, all organic, all natural, long-lasting, high-quality products.
[03:55:06.877 --> 03:55:11.219]  You're going to buy these essential items anyway from the grocery store.
[03:55:11.219 --> 03:55:12.240]  Why not buy them from us?
[03:55:13.740 --> 03:55:18.664]  Many of them are 20% less than the brands that you will see in major grocery stores.
[03:55:18.664 --> 03:55:23.189]  And again, these are high quality organic products.
[03:55:23.189 --> 03:55:33.798]  They don't contain all the crap, all the hidden toxic ingredients, and they're not overpriced like you will see with a lot of these type of products in the grocery store.
[03:55:33.798 --> 03:55:37.902]  I mean, the shampoo, for example, I mean, I pay what the equivalent of
[03:55:39.416 --> 03:55:45.640]  $12, $13, $14 for shampoo that doesn't contain all the parabens and all the toxic crap.
[03:55:45.640 --> 03:55:50.783]  Emmerich's Essentials, a line of organic household products now available at infowarsstore.com.
[03:55:50.783 --> 03:55:55.827]  Please go there, get them today, support the growth of this network.
[03:55:56.687 --> 03:56:02.069]  We got time for a few final news stories here in the last three minutes.
[03:56:02.069 --> 03:56:06.731]  Jailed NSA leaker reality winner being white is terrorism.
[03:56:06.731 --> 03:56:11.413]  Now, you probably heard Alex cover this earlier, but just think about the insanity.
[03:56:11.413 --> 03:56:19.616]  Crazed 25-year-old radicalized social justice warriors are being given top-level security clearances.
[03:56:20.660 --> 03:56:22.641]  How insane is that?
[03:56:22.641 --> 03:56:24.683]  Who was she radicalized by?
[03:56:24.683 --> 03:56:28.965]  We know she said that being white is terrorism, in her own words.
[03:56:28.965 --> 03:56:38.331]  We know she was a supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement, a violent domestic hate movement whose ideological guru is a cop-killing terrorist.
[03:56:38.331 --> 03:56:40.392]  Who was she radicalized by?
[03:56:40.392 --> 03:56:46.176]  John Oliver, The Daily Show, Stephen Colbert, Michael Moore, Leonardo DiCaprio.
[03:56:47.455 --> 03:56:50.998]  And for that she's facing life in prison.
[03:56:50.998 --> 03:56:53.601]  People have gone through her social media profiles.
[03:56:53.601 --> 03:56:55.983]  She said Donald Trump was an orange fascist.
[03:56:55.983 --> 03:56:58.045]  She was a Bernie Sanders supporter.
[03:56:58.045 --> 03:57:01.268]  Extreme far-left social justice warrior.
[03:57:01.268 --> 03:57:03.389]  Hysterical loon.
[03:57:03.389 --> 03:57:12.137]  Again proving the point that these people inside the intel agencies leaking this info are not doing it because they have the moral high ground.
[03:57:12.137 --> 03:57:13.419]  They're doing it because they have
[03:57:14.039 --> 03:57:18.421]  Trump Derangement Syndrome, they would rather see the country fail.
[03:57:18.421 --> 03:57:26.886]  They're happy to see the country fail, so long as it soothes their butthurt over Donald Trump winning the election.
[03:57:26.886 --> 03:57:29.587]  Incredible situation.
[03:57:29.587 --> 03:57:31.008]  More on the London terrorist.
[03:57:31.008 --> 03:57:32.509]  He attended a Muslim gym.
[03:57:32.509 --> 03:57:33.709]  It was segregated.
[03:57:33.709 --> 03:57:40.733]  Again, we have a society within a society in the UK where these people are ghettoized into these communities.
[03:57:40.733 --> 03:57:42.974]  Multiculturalism has completely failed.
[03:57:44.622 --> 03:58:00.714]  Now it turns out that the other guy was coming in and out of the country, having wanted to go to Syria, just like the Manchester bomber went to Libya, literally fought alongside Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, an Al-Qaeda affiliated terror organisation, was allowed back into the country.
[03:58:00.714 --> 03:58:07.979]  But just listen to Hillary Clinton, because she said all we need to do is understand their food.
[03:58:07.979 --> 03:58:10.862]  Yes, by understanding Muslim dietary habits.
[03:58:11.673 --> 03:58:13.895]  That means we can prevent terrorism.
[03:58:13.895 --> 03:58:15.376]  She literally said that.
