[00:00.000 --> 00:09.080]  The collusion argument, which a lot of Democrats state as a fact, like, oh, the collusion case.
[00:09.080 --> 00:12.320]  There is no collusion case.
[00:12.320 --> 00:17.240]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[00:17.240 --> 00:26.040]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things
[00:26.040 --> 00:27.040]  like that.
[00:27.040 --> 00:31.200]  He came, we saw, he died.
[00:31.200 --> 00:40.960]  The intervention led by NATO to topple Qaddafi has led to a failed state.
[00:40.960 --> 00:45.760]  Maybe Libya was not perfect under Qaddafi, but it had, even if to some extent, a functioning
[00:45.760 --> 00:50.920]  government, one unified country, it was a sovereign state.
[00:50.920 --> 00:56.320]  Libya now has two rival governments, a civil war that has left over 4,000 people dead and
[00:56.320 --> 00:57.720]  its cities are ruined.
[00:57.720 --> 01:04.960]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be.
[01:04.960 --> 01:09.480]  Women are treated, discriminated against in all of these countries she took money against.
[01:09.480 --> 01:13.200]  Gays and lesbians are either executed or punished severely.
[01:13.200 --> 01:14.680]  They're mistreated.
[01:14.680 --> 01:16.360]  She claims to be their champion.
[01:16.360 --> 01:19.920]  We let ISIS take this position.
[01:19.920 --> 01:26.080]  It was Hillary Clinton that she should get an award from them as the founder of ISIS.
[01:26.080 --> 01:31.400]  We had this brilliant idea that we were going to come to Pakistan and create a force of
[01:31.400 --> 01:36.200]  Mujahideen, equip them with stinger missiles and everything else to go after the Soviets
[01:36.200 --> 01:38.320]  inside Afghanistan.
[01:38.320 --> 01:39.320]  And we were successful.
[01:39.320 --> 01:41.820]  And this really just is so disgusting.
[01:41.820 --> 01:47.000]  When Vince Foster left his White House office on that July day in 1993, he told his secretary
[01:47.000 --> 01:49.040]  that he would be back.
[01:49.040 --> 01:53.440]  But the deputy White House counsel and boyhood friend of Bill Clinton never returned.
[01:53.440 --> 02:00.880]  There has been this urgency to end this and you know, historically that makes no sense.
[02:00.880 --> 02:05.840]  We all remember Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June in California.
[02:05.840 --> 02:10.720]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by
[02:10.720 --> 02:15.760]  changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story that's according
[02:15.760 --> 02:16.760]  to website Infowars.
[02:16.760 --> 02:22.960]  If a Google user types in Clinton body, they get car repair shop results instead of a story
[02:22.960 --> 02:26.960]  that talks about a list of people tied to the Clintons who have died under mysterious
[02:26.960 --> 02:29.120]  circumstances over the last three decades.
[02:29.120 --> 02:33.520]  Whistleblowers go to significant efforts to get us material and often very significant
[02:33.520 --> 02:34.520]  risks.
[02:34.520 --> 02:37.640]  We have upcoming leaks in relation to Hillary Clinton.
[02:37.640 --> 02:43.560]  You know, the emails we published show that Hillary Clinton is receiving constant updates
[02:43.560 --> 02:44.880]  about my personal situation.
[02:44.880 --> 02:49.360]  And the latest story was the death of DNC staffer Seth Ritch who was murdered last month
[02:49.360 --> 02:54.840]  in an apparent robbery, WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange has hinted that Rich was his
[02:54.840 --> 02:55.840]  source.
[02:55.840 --> 02:59.480]  But as may know from the comments about the case, that murder, we should say, remains
[02:59.480 --> 03:00.480]  unsolved.
[03:00.480 --> 03:06.320]  He's a 27 year old that works for the DNC who was shot in the back, murdered just two
[03:06.320 --> 03:10.960]  weeks ago for unknown reasons as he was walking down the street in Washington.
[03:10.960 --> 03:15.880]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[03:15.880 --> 03:22.760]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be.
[03:22.760 --> 03:35.800]  I don't know how dark your heart's got to be, Hillary, to openly finance the Arab Spring
[03:35.800 --> 03:42.440]  with Google and with George Soros and with NATO and with England and France and others
[03:42.440 --> 03:48.080]  and turn the Middle East and North Africa over to the most radical jihadis in the world
[03:48.080 --> 03:52.080]  or to make a deal with the UN to oversee our State Department and the refugee program
[03:52.080 --> 03:57.720]  and to flood us with unvetted refugees from failed states where they don't even have
[03:57.720 --> 04:04.760]  working passport systems like Sudan and Somalia, where the EMOM issues it basically.
[04:04.760 --> 04:09.240]  And then you call that extreme and student intellectuals like Stephen Colbert make jokes
[04:09.240 --> 04:10.240]  about it.
[04:10.240 --> 04:15.040]  Well, now, Hillary, with all the different terror attacks we're seeing in Paris and
[04:15.040 --> 04:23.320]  Australia unfolding right now, her answer is, way to stop terrorism is to understand
[04:23.320 --> 04:25.480]  other cultures and their food.
[04:25.480 --> 04:27.980]  Close close.
[04:27.980 --> 04:30.800]  Spoken like a true psychopath trying to act like she's a human.
[04:30.800 --> 04:35.680]  Yeah, how about you throw a leg of lamb that an Islamist is trying to kill you while they
[04:35.680 --> 04:39.440]  scream Allah Akbar and try to stab you and your wife or daughter's eyeballs out with
[04:39.440 --> 04:43.520]  some type of butcher knife.
[04:43.520 --> 04:44.520]  It's amazing.
[04:44.520 --> 04:47.920]  It's all coming up today and a bunch of huge guests and Megan Kelly.
[04:47.920 --> 04:53.920]  Oh, yeah, Megan Kelly is going to be invading the building like when they say an empire
[04:53.920 --> 04:55.440]  strikes back.
[04:55.440 --> 05:03.920]  Imperial troops have entered the base, Imperial troops have entered the base.
[05:03.920 --> 05:08.080]  The collapse of the left continues after Kathy Griffin's epic meltdown, Bill Maher
[05:08.080 --> 05:10.600]  is now the latest under fire for a public statement.
[05:10.600 --> 05:13.440]  Here's Bill Maher in an interview with Senator Ben Sass.
[05:13.440 --> 05:14.440]  You're welcome.
[05:14.440 --> 05:17.240]  We'd love to have you work in the fields with us.
[05:17.240 --> 05:18.240]  Work in the fields.
[05:18.240 --> 05:19.240]  That's part of that.
[05:19.240 --> 05:20.240]  Senator.
[05:20.240 --> 05:21.240]  I'm a house.
[05:21.240 --> 05:22.240]  Yeah.
[05:22.240 --> 05:29.040]  So Bill Maher uses a racial slur while interviewing a senator.
[05:29.040 --> 05:33.240]  But remember, the left does eat its own and liberals are now calling for his firing.
[05:33.240 --> 05:37.600]  Perhaps Bill Maher, who recognizes the reality of radical Islamic terror, may also recognize
[05:37.600 --> 05:39.720]  the reality of the insane left.
[05:39.720 --> 05:43.120]  While I don't believe this is anywhere near as bad as Griffin and shouldn't cost him
[05:43.120 --> 05:47.760]  his job, I do believe that this is just another example of the left crashing and burning,
[05:47.760 --> 05:51.320]  which will only mean more sweet victory in the next round of elections.
[05:51.320 --> 05:53.520]  This is Owen Troyer for infowars.com.
[05:53.520 --> 06:03.800]  Are you tired of winning yet?
[06:03.800 --> 06:06.680]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[06:06.680 --> 06:12.000]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance
[06:12.000 --> 06:14.880]  to organize and prepare a defense.
[06:14.880 --> 06:21.080]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums
[06:21.080 --> 06:23.600]  of their own, air raid sirens.
[06:23.600 --> 06:27.960]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[06:27.960 --> 06:32.640]  Pathogens added to the food and water, and to the lining of plastics that destroy our
[06:32.640 --> 06:37.600]  vitality, turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[06:37.600 --> 06:41.080]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[06:41.080 --> 06:49.040]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation
[06:49.040 --> 06:52.360]  to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[06:52.360 --> 06:55.240]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today.
[06:55.240 --> 07:00.120]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands, and it starts at infowarslife.com
[07:00.120 --> 07:01.120]  with Anthroplex.
[07:01.120 --> 07:03.560]  Emdix Essentials, that's my middle name.
[07:03.560 --> 07:09.880]  I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already
[07:09.880 --> 07:15.200]  trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic
[07:15.200 --> 07:16.200]  and high quality.
[07:16.200 --> 07:22.440]  This is one of the top three selling organic brands in the country that puts out high quality
[07:22.440 --> 07:25.400]  organic shampoo, mouthwash, you name it.
[07:25.400 --> 07:29.880]  And if they're such patriots, they have let us basically keep their well-known packaging.
[07:29.880 --> 07:33.920]  It is an answer to prayer, and because we're cutting out the middleman, 20% off retail,
[07:33.920 --> 07:37.080]  sign up for auto-ship, an additional 25% off.
[07:37.080 --> 07:38.160]  It's all there.
[07:38.160 --> 07:43.600]  The body wash, the shampoo, the deodorant, the mouthwash, all of it is truly game changing.
[07:43.600 --> 07:48.160]  It is the exact same product, just the name is different, Emdix Essentials, and it's
[07:48.160 --> 07:54.440]  on average 20% off what it would be in stores, buying it directly from infowarsstore.com.
[07:54.440 --> 07:57.560]  Help us win the info war while getting the products everybody needs, infowarslife.com,
[07:57.560 --> 08:01.080]  where you'll find the entire line of Emdix Essentials.
[08:01.080 --> 08:12.080]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's
[08:12.080 --> 08:17.080]  going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got
[08:17.080 --> 08:18.080]  one.
[08:18.080 --> 08:29.240]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[08:29.240 --> 08:32.800]  We are coming to you live from deep in the heart of Texas on Tuesday, the 6th day of
[08:32.800 --> 08:35.400]  June 2017.
[08:35.400 --> 08:41.400]  We are teleprompter free, but we've got Megan Kelly's crew here and she, I guess Darth Vader
[08:41.400 --> 08:45.480]  herself is going to be arriving a little bit later in the next hour, so I look forward
[08:45.480 --> 08:49.160]  to being interviewed for her a new program, she just interviewed Putin and that was a
[08:49.160 --> 08:50.160]  big success.
[08:50.160 --> 08:54.880]  And then I guess Trump's next, so I'm honored to be in that lineup, so it should be fun.
[08:54.880 --> 09:01.800]  The crew's pretty excited about it, but I never even had the riders in exchange doing
[09:01.800 --> 09:05.820]  this interview, but I did think that once she gets here, we need to try to at least
[09:05.820 --> 09:09.160]  haul her in front of the cameras a little bit, or if they don't air the interview, they'll
[09:09.160 --> 09:11.720]  say it, it never happened.
[09:11.720 --> 09:16.360]  But seriously, we'll definitely get you a Twitter picture or something like that out
[09:16.360 --> 09:22.360]  in the next few hours, but it all remains to be seen how the interview goes.
[09:22.360 --> 09:27.360]  Wow, we have got really some tragic news as usual for you in the month of Ramadan, the
[09:27.360 --> 09:32.440]  terror extravaganza month that comes around every year where you see Coptic Christians
[09:32.440 --> 09:38.480]  blown up and synagogues blown up and Shiite Mosque blown up and Sunni Mosque blown up
[09:38.480 --> 09:48.080]  and Alawite Mosque blown up and churches blown up in Europe and Ariana Grande concerts
[09:48.080 --> 09:55.440]  with young girls blown into bits by psychopathic killers that have nothing to do with Islam.
[09:55.440 --> 10:00.200]  Mayor Khan, who's turning London into London stand has said that.
[10:00.200 --> 10:05.480]  He says the problem is our president, Donald Trump, and he wants him banned.
[10:05.480 --> 10:10.600]  He does not want him to come to London, he says he's not welcome, and he wants the government
[10:10.600 --> 10:15.080]  to ban him entering the country, just like Michael Savage and thousands of others are,
[10:15.080 --> 10:19.960]  for what, criticizing the religion of peace.
[10:19.960 --> 10:26.080]  Meanwhile, Notre Dame Hammer attack investigated his terror officer and suspect, he was trying
[10:26.080 --> 10:30.560]  to kill people reportedly with a hammer screaming Allah Akbar as usual, Paris police officer
[10:30.560 --> 10:37.800]  attacked with hammer outside Notre Dame, Ramadan, Australia, not even the joeys are safe, why
[10:37.800 --> 10:43.960]  look at that jihadi crikey, gunman takes hostages, not funny for them, isn't the religion of
[10:43.960 --> 10:52.000]  peace, tells TV station this is for ISIS, isn't that nice, of course they were stabbing and
[10:52.000 --> 10:58.800]  killing people and running over the cars just a few days ago in London, London Bridge, screaming
[10:58.800 --> 11:04.360]  this is for Allah and Allah Akbar, but it had nothing to do with Islam, Notre Dame man
[11:04.360 --> 11:11.160]  shot by French police again after terror attack, 149 dead so far in Ramadan attacks, daily
[11:11.160 --> 11:16.280]  caller wrecks down that chronicle, former Islamic extremist warns Britain is in the midst
[11:16.280 --> 11:23.360]  of a jihadist insurgency, just like the Intifada and things in Israel, London terrorist was
[11:23.360 --> 11:29.800]  allowed to work at tube station despite being known jihadist who traveled back and forth,
[11:29.800 --> 11:37.000]  Scotland Yard confirms, at leisure to Libya where his father fought as a terrorist, but
[11:37.000 --> 11:43.640]  it's okay, because it has nothing to do with Islam and nothing to do with jihad, and if
[11:43.640 --> 11:49.200]  you say Islam has anything to do with jihad, or the jihads even the Koran, you're fake
[11:49.200 --> 11:54.240]  news, so says the same MSN that tells us Obamacare is going to be free, you didn't build your
[11:54.240 --> 12:00.120]  own business, and that Hillary Clinton doesn't look like a cross between a lot lizard and
[12:00.120 --> 12:08.520]  some type of overcooked pizza, now continuing, how bad is this going to get, well the answer
[12:08.520 --> 12:13.320]  is really bad, but what's really disgusting is the propaganda out of both the left and
[12:13.320 --> 12:18.760]  right wing, especially in the UK, what we need is total surveillance over the internet,
[12:18.760 --> 12:23.360]  they say, Theresa May, the Prime Minister, and we need to basically ban extremist talk,
[12:23.360 --> 12:28.920]  well I get banned all the time and restricted on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, that's Google,
[12:28.920 --> 12:35.000]  Google delist our stories, and they'll say, oh this is an extremist comment, your video
[12:35.000 --> 12:39.400]  is extremist, and the community has decided, and then I go look at the community that's
[12:39.400 --> 12:45.160]  doing it, and it's usually a bunch of jihadis or leftist college students that are admittedly
[12:45.160 --> 12:53.880]  going around in brigades, going and flagging things, and it'll be a video where I simply
[12:53.880 --> 12:58.000]  show some Islamists as saying, we're going to take over the West, we're going to kill
[12:58.000 --> 13:04.760]  you, we're going to enslave you, and they will then say, we say this is not allowed,
[13:04.760 --> 13:11.120]  or the type of stuff that gets flagged and blocked is where right wing watch had the
[13:11.120 --> 13:16.440]  true accurate clip in the same two minute clip where I said, I don't know if Hillary's
[13:16.440 --> 13:21.160]  killing kids in devil worshiping ceremonies, like the New House of Cards episode, I don't
[13:21.160 --> 13:24.720]  know if she's killing kids in a basement, but I know she funded jihadist and radicals
[13:24.720 --> 13:30.280]  all over the Middle East, she came, she saw Gaddafi died, they went into Syria, they started
[13:30.280 --> 13:34.320]  the civil war, and hundreds of thousands have died, and ISIS has sold tens of thousands
[13:34.320 --> 13:38.720]  of women and children to sex slavery, and they rape these little kids to death in some
[13:38.720 --> 13:43.720]  cases and murder them, and it's all over mainstream news, they're selling women as sex slaves
[13:43.720 --> 13:50.240]  out of Libya now, after the West made a failed state, so she is guilty of helping create
[13:50.240 --> 13:55.560]  ISIS and funding it, and she's guilty of murdering children, and Megan Kelly on Fox
[13:55.560 --> 14:02.120]  News sat there and played the clip with the front and the back chopped off of the same
[14:02.120 --> 14:08.840]  two minute clip, or minute and a half clip, to where I said she was in a basement, Hillary
[14:08.840 --> 14:13.840]  murdering children in a pizza place, then they take a little correction I do on other
[14:13.840 --> 14:19.240]  people's reporting, and then say that I was correcting myself on that, that's how you
[14:19.240 --> 14:24.160]  produce fake news, and when I asked Megan Kelly about it a few weeks ago on the phone,
[14:24.160 --> 14:28.200]  the conversation was off the record, she just, this part I'm going to tell you about, she
[14:28.200 --> 14:33.320]  said I don't remember that, I don't remember that, so today when she's here, it won't be
[14:33.320 --> 14:36.560]  on film, certainly they don't want that, but I'm going to sit there, because that's part
[14:36.560 --> 14:40.240]  of the condition of her coming here, and I'm going to show her right when you watch, that
[14:40.240 --> 14:43.040]  was hating me and attacking me, but at least they admitted it was a tongue in cheek piece
[14:43.040 --> 14:48.960]  I did, and then we're going to show her what her producers did, because that is fake news
[14:48.960 --> 14:53.000]  right there, so I want to know if she stands for that, because look, in fact here's the
[14:53.000 --> 14:57.920]  video since her crew is here, let's punch the video up on screen for TV viewers, you
[14:57.920 --> 15:02.200]  can pull up the article, exclusive Megan Kelly cup fabricating lies about Alex Jones, and
[15:02.200 --> 15:06.160]  I don't hate Megan Kelly, I used to like her when she, you know, was there reading the
[15:06.160 --> 15:11.280]  news on Fox News or whatever, when she came purely political, I started disliking her,
[15:11.280 --> 15:16.680]  and then when she had her producers do that to me, I really got upset, that's why I'm
[15:16.680 --> 15:24.040]  going to break down and cry right now, makes her cast, I actually need to wet my throat
[15:24.040 --> 15:30.320]  a little bit here, because we are teleprompter free news, so that's all coming up today
[15:30.320 --> 15:36.320]  as well, but first off, let's get to Hillary Clinton since we've been talking about this
[15:36.320 --> 15:43.920]  vicious evil, true wicked witch, I mean the lady in Wizard of Oz, disappearing into a
[15:43.920 --> 15:50.400]  cloud of green smoke has nothing on Hillary, and her consortium of flying monkeys, so here
[15:50.400 --> 15:57.680]  is Hillary Clinton, the story is up on infowars.com, it's a Paul Joseph Watson article, Hillary,
[15:57.680 --> 16:04.000]  way to stop terrorism is to understand other cultures and their food, here it is.
[16:04.000 --> 16:11.600]  This is a time for us to reach out to the world, to understand more about what is happening,
[16:11.600 --> 16:19.680]  not just in our own country, but indeed across the globe, it's a time for steady, determined
[16:19.680 --> 16:26.200]  leadership, like we are seeing from local authorities in London, including the mayor
[16:26.200 --> 16:35.680]  of London, and it is a time to remember how important our alliances are, you heard from
[16:35.680 --> 16:44.680]  Victor, you heard from Maya, you heard from the congressman, getting to know one another,
[16:44.680 --> 16:56.480]  learning about the experiences, the lives, the cultures, the religions, the food.
[16:56.480 --> 17:02.680]  So if you're just nice to Islam, and if you moved to Saudi Arabia, or you moved to Qatar,
[17:02.680 --> 17:11.560]  or you moved to Sudan, or you moved to Libya, or you moved to Rwanda, where now Muslims
[17:11.560 --> 17:15.120]  are coming in and attacking, or Nigeria, where they're bombing people and shooting people
[17:15.120 --> 17:24.120]  almost every day, if you go to Somalia, how dare President Trump block flights of people
[17:24.120 --> 17:30.080]  with Somali passports to the US, of course they're known to be terrorists, they're known
[17:30.080 --> 17:35.800]  to issue them to terrorists, they're known to support terrorism and piracy against everybody,
[17:35.800 --> 17:42.920]  and that's okay, we've got to let those people in unvetted, and I think the president's wrong.
[17:42.920 --> 17:52.040]  I think we should actually import Somali pirates to say Galveston Bay and just let them rob
[17:52.040 --> 17:58.160]  and murder and kill there too, because that's their culture, and all cultures are equal.
[17:58.160 --> 18:02.240]  I think we should get the time machine, bring back the Aztecs, and just let them set up
[18:02.240 --> 18:06.200]  in our neighborhoods, grab our kids out of backyards and chop their hearts out, of course
[18:06.200 --> 18:11.400]  I'm being sarcastic, but that's how crazy this is, the Nazis were an evil culture,
[18:11.400 --> 18:18.440]  we don't need to accept it, the Aztecs were an evil culture by the time they collapsed.
[18:18.440 --> 18:23.640]  We can look at cultures that are bad and say this isn't good, and currently the Orthodox
[18:23.640 --> 18:34.480]  Islam that is the exploding ideology and political and religious system on the planet today is
[18:34.480 --> 18:37.040]  going through its reformation.
[18:37.040 --> 18:42.480]  This is Islam's reformation, getting back to the roots of robbing the caravans there
[18:42.480 --> 18:50.160]  at Mecca 1500 years ago, 1400 years ago, the slave trade coming out of the slave trade
[18:50.160 --> 18:57.280]  there at the four corners, there at the crossroads of the caravans, of the spice road, of the
[18:57.280 --> 19:02.160]  silk roads, where you grab the women, you sell the children, you have the slave pits,
[19:02.160 --> 19:06.680]  you rob your neighbors, you do this, women are not humans, you can do what you want with
[19:06.680 --> 19:13.640]  them, the Koran says black people aren't humans, and then by the time the liberal media turns
[19:13.640 --> 19:17.800]  it around, black folks run out and convert to Islam, because that's what you do, because
[19:17.800 --> 19:24.960]  the Muslims started the modern global slave trade 1400 years ago, but by the time MSM's
[19:24.960 --> 19:31.200]  done with it, the West, England that ended global slavery, except in a few Islamic countries
[19:31.200 --> 19:36.880]  today, it gets the blame, and America gets the blame, the West gets the blame, the Republicans
[19:36.880 --> 19:42.160]  that pass the Civil Rights Act, they get the blame, the Democrats that are the KKK party,
[19:42.160 --> 19:46.200]  they are the people that fight the racism, Arnold Schwarzenegger says he loves Hitler,
[19:46.200 --> 19:52.000]  he gets ADL awards, I say I hate Hitler, I'm attacked by the ADL, upside down world, see
[19:52.000 --> 19:58.040]  how it works, when we come back, we've got big news on the mayor of London stand, yes

[20:31.560 --> 20:42.780]  Tiffani Janks, remember that name, Tiffani Janks Illuminati in the New World Order remember
[20:42.780 --> 20:44.820]  her, the Oregon police remember her, murdered October 8th, 2013 at the age of 35, the story
[20:44.820 --> 20:50.480]  of Tiffani Janks, a woman under mind control was murdered, who really killed Tiffany Janks,
[20:50.480 --> 20:54.920]  a story that won't go away, read about it on Facebook at Tiffani Janks Murder spelled
[20:54.920 --> 21:06.220]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[21:06.220 --> 21:10.920]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[21:10.920 --> 21:12.420]  to detoxify the body.
[21:12.420 --> 21:17.260]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[21:17.260 --> 21:18.780]  It's made in the USA.
[21:18.780 --> 21:23.660]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[21:23.660 --> 21:25.480]  the body and it supports the info war.
[21:25.480 --> 21:27.720]  It is a classical 360 win.
[21:27.720 --> 21:32.200]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe
[21:32.200 --> 21:36.800]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[21:36.800 --> 21:37.800]  get.
[21:37.800 --> 21:41.020]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this

[21:51.240 --> 21:55.080]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be thanks to your support and your

[23:40.240 --> 23:44.040]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless

[24:10.400 --> 24:37.040]  Let me tell you who's coming up on the broadcast today.
[24:37.040 --> 24:41.480]  We have Tommy Robbins, obviously right there in the middle of London, staying with the ongoing
[24:41.480 --> 24:43.400]  terror attacks that happen every few days.
[24:43.400 --> 24:44.640]  He'll be popping in.
[24:44.640 --> 24:51.280]  We have Ben Garrison, the amazing cartoonist, who I think is the emblematic political cartoonist
[24:51.280 --> 24:52.280]  of our age.
[24:52.280 --> 24:53.280]  There's some other great people.
[24:53.280 --> 24:54.280]  Anthony Frida.
[24:54.280 --> 24:55.280]  He's just not as prolific.
[24:55.280 --> 24:57.720]  There's some other great folks out there as well.
[24:57.720 --> 25:00.760]  Racco, I think is his name.
[25:00.760 --> 25:01.760]  Brocco.
[25:01.760 --> 25:04.760]  But when you get down to it, it is Ben Garrison.
[25:04.760 --> 25:05.760]  It's simply amazing.
[25:05.760 --> 25:12.800]  By the way, we sell his new book that is a compendium of many of his best political cartoons.
[25:12.800 --> 25:18.520]  A great way to wake people up, to have it on your coffee table or give it to a libtard
[25:18.520 --> 25:23.040]  in your family or to leave one at the barber shop.
[25:23.040 --> 25:26.680]  This is an information war or go donate one to the library.
[25:26.680 --> 25:33.840]  Then thousands of people will read it and you have to have that information warfare perspective
[25:33.840 --> 25:38.560]  that you understand that every heart and every mind we reach is a major victory against
[25:38.560 --> 25:40.960]  the globalists and we have turned the tide.
[25:40.960 --> 25:44.360]  Their global government TPP is destroyed.
[25:44.360 --> 25:47.640]  Their global carbon tax, the Paris Accord is on fire.
[25:47.640 --> 25:51.840]  This is irrevocable damage to the New World Order.
[25:51.840 --> 25:56.600]  The above the law corporatocracy that they've denied existed in Bilderberg and all of it
[25:56.600 --> 26:01.040]  and it's out in the open and then Hollywood and all the low information voters on Facebook
[26:01.040 --> 26:05.560]  are just, he's stomping the earth, he hates the earth.
[26:05.560 --> 26:10.560]  Now America and Europe won't be the only ones with carbon taxes to shut off our economies.
[26:10.560 --> 26:14.560]  Oh no.
[26:14.560 --> 26:18.240]  Now there'll be less dirty plants in China because the plants won't get built there.
[26:18.240 --> 26:20.680]  They'll get built here where it's totally clean.
[26:20.680 --> 26:21.680]  No, it's not true.
[26:21.680 --> 26:22.680]  It's impossible.
[26:22.680 --> 26:23.680]  No Trump.
[26:23.680 --> 26:24.680]  Don't kill the earth.
[26:24.680 --> 26:26.680]  No, we're saviors of the earth.
[26:26.680 --> 26:31.680]  We've been cast as the saviors.
[26:31.680 --> 26:35.600]  We're just a bunch of idiots that are trendy and don't have jobs and have two or three
[26:35.600 --> 26:39.160]  college degrees that are worthless but we listen to Stephen Colbert and we want to feel
[26:39.160 --> 26:45.480]  important and you're the bad guy hurting us and trying to keep the jihadis out.
[26:45.480 --> 26:48.480]  I mean think about how crazy he is.
[26:48.480 --> 26:53.480]  In total failed states where the Emoms issue the passports like Somalia.
[26:53.480 --> 27:01.680]  He says they can't come in from Somalia, bad man, bad man.
[27:01.680 --> 27:06.040]  I mean think about how evil Trump is and every time there's another terror track he's proven
[27:06.040 --> 27:09.840]  wrong see because he said there'd be more terror attacks because you let in people from
[27:09.840 --> 27:13.680]  third world Islamic hellholes that are all killing each other and they're totally crazed
[27:13.680 --> 27:17.440]  and have a culture of not working just murdering each other and walking around in nightgowns
[27:17.440 --> 27:22.320]  and they wipe their asses with their hands and they're just total complete fiend demons
[27:22.320 --> 27:26.880]  that cut their children's genitals off and then you know put hoods over women's heads
[27:26.880 --> 27:31.120]  and beat them to death if they talk back and rape any women they want the woman complains
[27:31.120 --> 27:36.160]  she gets charged with the sex crimes and throw gays off buildings and murder everybody.
[27:36.160 --> 27:42.080]  How about Trump bans people from any country that throw gays off buildings and the governments
[27:42.080 --> 27:44.240]  openly certify it and say it's good.
[27:44.240 --> 27:47.600]  How about people are banned from any country where women have to wear hoods over their
[27:47.600 --> 27:48.600]  heads.
[27:48.600 --> 27:54.560]  Oh but the media spins the whole thing and they sit there and they say oh actually the
[27:54.560 --> 27:57.280]  answer here is we should all wear hoods.
[27:57.280 --> 28:02.600]  This is a sign of feminism so the west is horrible and evil and all over the country
[28:02.600 --> 28:08.480]  at campuses they're having no whites days run by the faculty creating total racism and
[28:08.480 --> 28:13.720]  division under multiculturalism and they're bringing in incompatible most radical forms
[28:13.720 --> 28:18.640]  of vile Islam that is a true cult.
[28:18.640 --> 28:24.560]  Islam in its orthodox, Wahhabist form is the biggest, oldest, most dangerous, murderous,
[28:24.560 --> 28:30.200]  incompatible, cancerous cult on the planet but they have official UN videos and German
[28:30.200 --> 28:35.720]  TV ads put out by the state government with their rock stars and their music stars first
[28:35.720 --> 28:41.400]  wearing turbans and going I wear the hajib it's fun and the next it's a real hajib and
[28:41.400 --> 28:45.400]  then it's a beekeeper suit over their heads and those of us that see this cult taking
[28:45.400 --> 28:51.400]  over we got upset about it because we know our government and the left and the globalist
[28:51.400 --> 28:57.920]  and the Ford Foundation is out there financing and foaming every incompatible system every
[28:57.920 --> 29:01.840]  authoritarian system to bring them into our countries and then let them have their way
[29:01.840 --> 29:06.760]  with us so that they can then turn around and say oh we got to surveil all of you oh
[29:06.760 --> 29:09.320]  we have to control the internet oh we have to censor everybody oh we have to take your
[29:09.320 --> 29:12.280]  rights away oh we got to get rid of this and that and everything else got to have all this
[29:12.280 --> 29:17.920]  happen meanwhile England won't let its citizens have guns to defend themselves and they bring
[29:17.920 --> 29:25.640]  in absolute murderous scum who are admittedly part of jihad groups who fought in Libya and
[29:25.640 --> 29:30.520]  fought in Syria overthrowing those countries and murdering people and then they bring them
[29:30.520 --> 29:35.160]  back and wonder why they're killing people and Trump says if you fought for ISIS you
[29:35.160 --> 29:40.000]  shouldn't be allowed back in the country how about you should be dead how about set a deport
[29:40.000 --> 29:43.720]  these people that fought for ISIS we give them a real quick trial and then we hang their
[29:43.720 --> 29:49.280]  asses I'll be there I'll kick the lever I'm ready to kill these people after a court finds
[29:49.280 --> 29:56.000]  them guilty of being mass murderers we're on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones
[29:56.000 --> 30:07.240]  and the GCN radio network the collapse of the left continues after Kathy Griffin's epic
[30:07.240 --> 30:11.360]  meltdown Bill Maher is now the latest under fire for a public statement here's Bill Maher
[30:11.360 --> 30:15.280]  in an interview with Senator Ben Sass you're welcome we'd love to have you work in the
[30:15.280 --> 30:29.680]  fields with us so Bill Maher uses a racial slur while interviewing a senator but remember
[30:29.680 --> 30:34.200]  the left does eat its own and liberals are now calling for his firing perhaps Bill Maher
[30:34.200 --> 30:38.920]  who recognizes the reality of radical Islamic terror may also recognize the reality of the
[30:38.920 --> 30:43.000]  insane left while I don't believe this is anywhere near as bad as Griffin and shouldn't
[30:43.000 --> 30:47.200]  cost him his job I do believe that this is just another example of the left crashing
[30:47.200 --> 30:51.640]  and burning which will only mean more sweet victory in the next round of elections this
[30:51.640 --> 31:03.280]  is Owen Troyer for info wars dot com are you tired of winning yet it's not just our water
[31:03.280 --> 31:07.440]  we need to filter it's not just our food that needs to be cleaned it's the air we're breathing
[31:07.440 --> 31:13.880]  especially for our children the artificial particulates the chemicals is absolutely weighing down
[31:13.880 --> 31:18.760]  our immune systems the same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa
[31:18.760 --> 31:24.480]  pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa pure breeze whether
[31:24.480 --> 31:29.480]  it's your home or office you know it's yourself your co-workers your family your children to
[31:29.480 --> 31:34.480]  the best job you can to purify your air the elite are masters at poisoning our environment
[31:34.480 --> 31:39.840]  while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most toxic effects for themselves
[31:39.840 --> 31:44.800]  the general public doesn't the Alexa pure breeze would be a steal at three hundred four
[31:44.800 --> 31:48.520]  hundred five hundred dollars one of these systems can keep eight hundred square feet
[31:48.520 --> 31:53.000]  incredibly clean this is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older
[31:53.000 --> 31:58.560]  more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job find out why this system is so revolutionary
[31:58.560 --> 32:05.440]  today info or store dot com we've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together
[32:05.440 --> 32:10.800]  with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave
[32:10.800 --> 32:15.440]  us your mother nature to detoxify the body that's why I'm introducing the shield toxic
[32:15.440 --> 32:21.400]  metal and chemical defense support it's made in the USA it's filled with known compounds
[32:21.400 --> 32:25.400]  from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports
[32:25.400 --> 32:30.480]  the info or it is a classical three sixty when this is the formula that I personally
[32:30.480 --> 32:35.080]  have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection
[32:35.080 --> 32:39.920]  when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get you want yourself you want your family

[33:09.760 --> 33:36.840]  developments years before they happen right here on the Alex Jones show
[33:36.840 --> 33:40.120]  come back I'm Alex Jones your host got a bunch of big guests coming up today but before
[33:40.120 --> 33:44.720]  I get back into who's coming up let me just explain what I just did earlier so we can
[33:44.720 --> 33:48.760]  actually take this clip later put it out as a video for the general public not to start
[33:48.760 --> 33:52.720]  great audience of radio affiliates and TV stations and folks watching live right now
[33:52.720 --> 33:59.240]  and info wars dot com I deliberately this morning thought about how do I trigger a debate
[33:59.240 --> 34:05.320]  about radical orthodox Islam's tenant being kill everyone outside of Islam that's why
[34:05.320 --> 34:10.520]  they're constantly killing other Muslims that they catch drinking or who are gay or lesbian
[34:10.520 --> 34:15.360]  or whatever and I'm not even a gay or lesbian activist I don't go to gay parades I don't
[34:15.360 --> 34:20.000]  hate those people though I want them to have their own life I'm upset by Islam running
[34:20.000 --> 34:26.040]  around killing them in mass and you wonder why Islam continues to attack the gay bars
[34:26.040 --> 34:31.400]  and the little you know teeny bopper Andrea grande liberal events and they said we don't
[34:31.400 --> 34:38.400]  like a bunch of young women dancing around without male escorts we're gonna kill them
[34:38.400 --> 34:45.120]  that was a sinful event teenage girls they're listening to another woman posing as a teenage
[34:45.120 --> 34:52.520]  girl who quote hopes are effing fans die Ariana Grande a true pig like creature and they're
[34:52.520 --> 34:57.480]  there they get killed and the media tries to cover up that it's Islamic the usual thing
[34:57.480 --> 35:03.640]  and so yes I'm saying Trump's being called a radical for banning seven countries where
[35:03.640 --> 35:08.240]  they don't have real passport systems in many of them failed states like Libya thanks to
[35:08.240 --> 35:15.280]  Hillary and Obama again failed states like Somalia on and on and on we accept the weirdo
[35:15.280 --> 35:22.360]  passports that are issued by the caliphate with the symbol of al-qaeda you know that
[35:22.360 --> 35:27.480]  black flag you see ISIS has them they all have that's not the al-qaeda flag that's the
[35:27.480 --> 35:34.920]  flag al-qaeda uses that's the Wahhabist flag and so if they've been in battle zones and
[35:34.920 --> 35:39.400]  are bragging about killing people and posing in photographs with severed heads type into
[35:39.400 --> 35:43.560]  mainstream news even reported their sex slavery out of Libya now where they're trafficking
[35:43.560 --> 35:48.280]  women and little girls type it into a search engine so yes if you're kidnapping and raping
[35:48.280 --> 35:54.400]  little girls and if you're murdering people and if you're making the Libyan military that
[35:54.400 --> 35:58.880]  was secular compared to you eat their own bodies before you kill them so they go to
[35:58.880 --> 36:06.160]  hell you believe that I'm saying you deserve to be tried for crimes against humanity like
[36:06.160 --> 36:13.600]  the Nazis at Nuremberg and hung by the neck until dead just like those damn Nazis but
[36:13.600 --> 36:18.480]  if I say hang the Nazis I'll kick the lever well of course that's good but if I say I'd
[36:18.480 --> 36:22.840]  kick the lever for a convicted ISIS killer I guarantee it's gonna be on media matters
[36:22.840 --> 36:28.720]  and George Soros and others going oh my gosh he said he wants to kill people I said after
[36:28.720 --> 36:34.960]  they're tried after they're convicted I don't personally want to get near them and watch
[36:34.960 --> 36:42.560]  them twitch and jerk I just want those animals euthanized but I'm saying I'd belly up if
[36:42.560 --> 36:49.960]  I had to and get near their stinking pig like carcasses if I had to because they're a bunch
[36:49.960 --> 36:56.600]  of murdering trash and so the president tries to stop this murdering trash from pouring
[36:56.600 --> 37:02.440]  into the country and then we're supposed to sit here and take it like it's some form of
[37:02.440 --> 37:08.880]  hospitality and Trump calls it a travel ban and then people go oh my gosh he would get
[37:08.880 --> 37:12.240]  it through he didn't call it a travel ban because he's not trying to get things done
[37:12.240 --> 37:17.480]  by lying even the controlled leftist corporate media admits he's telling the truth he told
[37:17.480 --> 37:23.360]  the Russian ambassador the Russian investigation was nuts because they all know it's nuts he
[37:23.360 --> 37:27.880]  hasn't gotten anything from Russia it's totally normal during a transition to be talking to
[37:27.880 --> 37:35.280]  the ambassadors and presidents he should have already met with Putin but see the optics
[37:35.280 --> 37:42.040]  oh Mr. President Mr. President don't do that but I told you a month ago at Cernovich we
[37:42.040 --> 37:45.640]  both have our sources that Trump was going to go back to hardcore populist and was going
[37:45.640 --> 37:51.520]  to ignore his advisors and run over them and what did you see everything we told you now
[37:51.520 --> 37:57.000]  and now CNN and others report that he's turned super populist Trump's populist wing on the
[37:57.000 --> 38:01.960]  rise and of course Bannon's in there advising Trump but only because it clicks with what
[38:01.960 --> 38:09.120]  Trump believes as a blue collar billionaire as a guy that came up running big crews construction
[38:09.120 --> 38:16.200]  crews you name it liking America tough guy patriot not out to get you and Bannon is a
[38:16.200 --> 38:22.040]  blue collar union tough guy to used to be a liberal these are real liberals that aren't
[38:22.040 --> 38:28.200]  out to screw the country you want to see a real liberal Donald John Trump Stephen Bannon
[38:28.200 --> 38:34.080]  those are liberals those are Americans I'm a liberal I believe in freedom I believe in
[38:34.080 --> 38:38.280]  low taxes I believe in the right to self-defense I believe people should be able to practice
[38:38.280 --> 38:41.160]  the religion they want or not and they should be able to have the sexual preference they
[38:41.160 --> 38:44.760]  want and they should be able to go to the schools they want and they should be left alone and
[38:44.760 --> 38:49.200]  not bullied by political correctness and they shouldn't have no white days at campuses and
[38:49.200 --> 38:56.000]  whites shouldn't be taught they're inherently evil and bad but this is the mind warp of
[38:56.000 --> 39:00.640]  the Democratic Party and the sick Hollywood culture that wants to enslave this country
[39:00.640 --> 39:06.240]  and dominate it so bad that it'll do anything including weaponized culture to destroy flyover
[39:06.240 --> 39:12.840]  country and to destroy the bitter clingers and that's what we're coming down to here
[39:12.840 --> 39:18.480]  and the human species is awake and not backing down ladies and gentlemen of every race, color
[39:18.480 --> 39:23.720]  and creed we do all bleed red blood and we do have one sovereign flag that is the history
[39:23.720 --> 39:32.000]  of our republic and I call it 1776 worldwide and Donald Trump is launching operation 1776
[39:32.000 --> 39:36.280]  that's what all this is a lot of people in the government and the CIA and everywhere
[39:36.280 --> 39:41.040]  else go stuff Jones was saying 15 years ago word for word has come out of Trump's mouth
[39:41.040 --> 39:48.440]  stuff he was saying five years ago word for word yes you guessed it of course the president
[39:48.440 --> 39:53.280]  and of course Bannon and of course all those people and the military and the generals listen
[39:53.280 --> 39:58.360]  to me and you know why they listen because they already know everything I know and more
[39:58.360 --> 40:03.120]  this is just one of the only radio shows that actually is in reality they don't get their
[40:03.120 --> 40:10.520]  info from me they're on the same page because we're we're bringing back America we want
[40:10.520 --> 40:17.560]  the republic to be strong we want prosperity we want 1950 2.0 people go oh you want to
[40:17.560 --> 40:23.200]  go back no 1950 was when we was science and we could do anything and we were going to
[40:23.200 --> 40:27.120]  end the discrimination in America and we were going to come together because we just won
[40:27.120 --> 40:32.680]  world war two and darn it we weren't like those Nazis and the democrats were scared
[40:32.680 --> 40:37.440]  the KKK wasn't popular anymore they know what to do so they became the anti-racist and you
[40:37.440 --> 40:42.000]  see them using their same tricks today whether it's Nancy Pelosi or Maxine Waters these are
[40:42.000 --> 40:48.320]  conscious evil race pimp horrible people who hate everybody and are using divide and conquer
[40:48.320 --> 40:56.360]  when Donald Trump is unifying the people and having them come together now unifying America
[40:56.360 --> 41:02.960]  not unifying us with the UN and global government and TPP and IMF and World Bank and all these
[41:02.960 --> 41:07.280]  things we never got a vote in and to watch the corporate media sit there dumbfounded
[41:07.280 --> 41:11.840]  when he had that speech recently pulling out of the Paris Accords when he told it like
[41:11.840 --> 41:20.680]  it was to the whole world and said I represent Pittsburgh not Paris and this is a screw job
[41:20.680 --> 41:26.320]  and here's how the taxes affect us and it's designed to shut us down economically and
[41:26.320 --> 41:33.040]  to pick winners and losers by a corporate elite that was high noon to count Dracula that was
[41:33.040 --> 41:40.520]  like dragging his coffin out in the middle of a big field on the 4th of July and just
[41:40.520 --> 41:47.280]  opening that coffin up and count Dracula is burning up right now George Soros the new
[41:47.280 --> 41:53.800]  world order their whole big plan their whole technocracies is dying the American people
[41:53.800 --> 42:00.760]  and the bricks that everybody else have already literally driven two foot short sword double
[42:00.760 --> 42:05.520]  edge daggers up through the sternum into the heart and are just sloshing around the liver
[42:05.520 --> 42:09.680]  kidneys and everything else and we just pulled the knife on the globalists are stumbling
[42:09.680 --> 42:14.080]  off bleeding to death and they know it the most important thing politically to understand
[42:14.080 --> 42:22.000]  though is while they die while the giant squid dies let's make sure it can't get its tentacles
[42:22.000 --> 42:29.760]  wrapped around us and drag us to the bottom so don't ever give up while the giant squids
[42:29.760 --> 42:33.440]  rolling around bleeding to death were the equivalent of sperm whales we got to turn
[42:33.440 --> 42:38.200]  in and go over and get another big bite in another big bite in and make sure they know
[42:38.200 --> 42:43.400]  we know you're the enemy we know you hate America we know you're a bunch of alpha psychopaths
[42:43.400 --> 42:47.840]  that think you're better than us and I think you'll dominate us and just like the communists
[42:47.840 --> 42:52.720]  and just like the fascists and just like the redcoats America is coming back and is going
[42:52.720 --> 43:00.320]  to kick your butt politically so get ready the trance you've had over humanity is over
[43:00.320 --> 43:10.520]  so get ready nationalism free market is the winning team always has been always will be
[43:10.520 --> 43:17.880]  the Renaissance 550 years old ladies and gentlemen and it's about to go into full bloom and we're
[43:17.880 --> 43:23.720]  about to see the greatest innovations and the secrets of the universe unlocked and the
[43:23.720 --> 43:29.080]  globalists don't want that they want the university's busy turning the youth into basket cases
[43:29.080 --> 43:32.920]  that are mentally ill and all fighting with each other so that you're so screwed up and
[43:32.920 --> 43:37.400]  such a such a chip on the shoulder neurotic that by the time you get three degrees and
[43:37.400 --> 43:42.560]  you're $150,000 in debt and you realize you'll never get out of debt because just the financing
[43:42.560 --> 43:49.200]  of it'll be another $100,000 you're so politically scrambled in a cult you don't know what hit
[43:49.200 --> 43:59.840]  you up and that's what this is all about and it's going to get worse it's going to get
[43:59.840 --> 44:03.800]  worse and it's going to get worse and worse and worse because of your big foreign banks
[44:03.800 --> 44:07.480]  in the hijacked country all you can do is create divide and conquer it's called the
[44:07.480 --> 44:12.880]  great game but British intelligence use to control India with only 10,000 men they can
[44:12.880 --> 44:18.920]  control tens of millions of people by creating tribal animosity and divide and conquer and
[44:18.920 --> 44:27.800]  they created sociology to go into India and other areas with the first vanguard doctors
[44:27.800 --> 44:37.080]  normally and missionaries and then they would go in and track all the divisions righted up
[44:37.080 --> 44:42.880]  and then come back in within another 10, 15, 20 years and then start the civil wars and
[44:42.880 --> 44:46.320]  so you got all these dirt bags like Gruber who sits up there on C-span with a bunch of
[44:46.320 --> 44:50.040]  professors going and they're all like fawning after me goes I know how to scam Americans
[44:50.040 --> 44:53.760]  they're so stupid they have no attention spans we're going to double and triple their prices
[44:53.760 --> 44:57.840]  and I was chosen to come up with the lies I am the great and they're just like oh you
[44:57.840 --> 45:01.880]  just see so proud just I'm the big liar I say it on TV and all the big leftists are
[45:01.880 --> 45:07.840]  like oh god you're helping bring down America you are so incredibly I know I am I'm so incredible
[45:07.840 --> 45:12.720]  and he's just sitting there just on a total power trip and that's what they go to college
[45:12.720 --> 45:17.520]  for that's the upper crust though you go knowing your sociopath or psychopath knowing you're
[45:17.520 --> 45:21.000]  going to prey on everyone and then you try to get into the upper graduate areas so you
[45:21.000 --> 45:25.200]  can actually fawn after the elites and will you teach me how to be a good liar and then
[45:25.200 --> 45:29.160]  can I work for you and help oppress the people and suck off of them and they all cackle and
[45:29.160 --> 45:32.920]  laugh read the read the WikiLeaks they're like top Democrats are saying we're losing
[45:32.920 --> 45:36.960]  this war we're trying to keep them in the dark and helpless best we can these are quotes
[45:36.960 --> 45:40.360]  we're trying to keep them in the dark and helpless but it's not working now they're
[45:40.360 --> 45:43.840]  not listening to us they're still not moving against us but if they start moving against
[45:43.840 --> 45:47.960]  us we're going to lose the answers culture war we've got to we've got to intensify it
[45:47.960 --> 45:57.200]  and that's what all this is so when you understand you see one of these fake liberals these are
[45:57.200 --> 46:03.640]  sociopaths who are beta males who want to be in dominant positions but don't want to
[46:03.640 --> 46:08.800]  create economies don't want responsibility don't want prosperity they want to see everybody
[46:08.800 --> 46:14.720]  else fail so they feel big so you get consortiums of beta males together with also control
[46:14.720 --> 46:21.040]  free cryptic women and they build these alliances with psychology and all the rest of it to
[46:21.040 --> 46:25.480]  create an unaware oh yeah let's oh they found another one I forgot this one the unaware
[46:25.480 --> 46:33.680]  and compliant and ignorant yes that's another one of them oh you're so smart oh my gosh you
[46:33.680 --> 46:38.600]  put the wrong you know you told women don't breastfeed and put out for generations formula
[46:38.600 --> 46:43.920]  combinations you knew would reduce IQ 30 points oh you're such you're so advanced you created
[46:43.920 --> 46:49.680]  billions of quasi retarded people to rule over everyone so you could be so powerful
[46:49.680 --> 46:54.120]  and then get a bunch of mercenary TV crews to run around and point at somebody who's
[46:54.120 --> 46:59.080]  actually virile and alive and primitive and is aware of what they're doing and is exposing
[46:59.080 --> 47:02.640]  it so they can make all their jokes all day and have their top buffered characters the
[47:02.640 --> 47:07.160]  rest of it but you know what I am primitive Lee reaching out to people in an emergency
[47:07.160 --> 47:11.960]  warning saying you are under attack we are under attack these are con artists that are
[47:11.960 --> 47:16.040]  running your life and if you go along with them you have conned yourself and when you
[47:16.040 --> 47:19.720]  give in to them you have conned yourself come out of the trance you don't believe what
[47:19.720 --> 47:23.960]  I believe you don't follow what I follow you just have to know you've been lied to and
[47:23.960 --> 47:34.560]  take the blinders off that's all I'm asking that's all I'm asking I got a bunch of clips
[47:34.560 --> 47:40.960]  I want to get to a ton of stuff I want to break down Hillary though just said don't
[47:40.960 --> 47:45.080]  worry about a jihad attack if a guy screams comes into your pub screaming Allah hot bar
[47:45.080 --> 47:49.760]  with you know a two-foot knife three guys come in and start stabbing women in front
[47:49.760 --> 47:56.360]  of you imagine I've got the full reports here the Islamist always target the weakest
[47:56.360 --> 48:00.280]  and they got a thing about hating women and so I guess they figure they can kill more
[48:00.280 --> 48:03.680]  because they won't resist as much and they just start stabbing them right in the eyes
[48:03.680 --> 48:07.320]  and right in the throat and the men report they would just stand there while he was
[48:07.320 --> 48:12.640]  stabbed each woman ten times I'm loving I'm liberal this is this is for Allah this is

[48:41.800 --> 48:45.680]  third time he spent like was it ten years in prison I'm going from memory and so this

[48:52.520 --> 48:56.160]  Western culture it wasn't Renaissance but at least he had something he had allegiance
[48:56.160 --> 49:00.280]  to at least it was willing to stand up this was his pub his people he just watched them
[49:00.280 --> 49:05.800]  stab a bunch of people and they're talking about how incredible lion he is I mean let
[49:05.800 --> 49:10.440]  me tell you I want to survive three guys pop in here with knives man I'm going to overturn
[49:10.440 --> 49:14.800]  this I'm going to grab this bottle of course I'm I'm I'm here in the United States and
[49:14.800 --> 49:18.640]  my forebears made sure I had the second amendment I fought for and I've got my concealed carry
[49:18.640 --> 49:24.160]  so oh guess what a jihadi's busting here they're going to have to face my nine millimeter
[49:24.160 --> 49:29.560]  but see imagine see this guy that fought him a hundred people stood there and just watched
[49:29.560 --> 49:34.680]  as they stabbed women he's the weirdo he's the bad guy I'm the weirdo because I've got
[49:34.680 --> 49:39.400]  a firearm the government can have big armored bases and command bases and nuclear weapons
[49:39.400 --> 49:44.240]  and take my tax money to have it but if I've got a firearm see it's scary isn't it and
[49:44.240 --> 49:50.480]  it was so scary when I was growing up you know if some gang member four years older
[49:50.480 --> 49:55.880]  than me when I'm like 12 starts beating me up and so I pick a brick up and smash it over
[49:55.880 --> 49:59.280]  their head and the police get there and they go well the people said they saw he attacked
[49:59.280 --> 50:03.960]  you but you know this guy's this guy's in a coma we're gonna have to take you to juvenile
[50:03.960 --> 50:08.320]  see it was still bad it was still bad you've got a 12 year old beating his head in the
[50:08.320 --> 50:13.520]  ground and you're like 16 17 years old trying to kill me and I fought back I'm the bad man
[50:13.520 --> 50:19.080]  I'm the evil man I never attacked anybody didn't attack me first but see I'm the ultimate
[50:19.080 --> 50:24.760]  evil you see because the sociopaths and psychopaths they don't like anybody standing up that's
[50:24.760 --> 50:43.400]  why they've got their filthy degenerate stinking nanny state I'm gonna skip this break you
[50:43.400 --> 50:51.000]  know I would have gotten this wound up today even if Megan Kelly hadn't been here I haven't
[50:51.000 --> 50:55.840]  gotten wound up in a while as much because I just I just it's I try to just I try to
[50:55.840 --> 50:58.800]  realize what social engineers are doing and just deal with it intellectually and take
[50:58.800 --> 51:03.880]  care of it but I understand I need to be real with people at a primitive level people ask
[51:03.880 --> 51:12.320]  am I fake am I an actor I've been in movies I can be an actor but I've always played parts
[51:12.320 --> 51:20.040]  that were what I already believed understand it's like saying are you an actor when you
[51:20.040 --> 51:25.560]  go up to a pretty woman and are trying to be charming no you're being yourself but it's
[51:25.560 --> 51:29.440]  the same thing I'm angry about the Islamic attacks I'm angry about the apologies for
[51:29.440 --> 51:37.200]  it I'm genuinely pissed off and then I let myself be that way on air but I'm in control
[51:37.200 --> 51:44.560]  of myself most of the time but all I'm saying is I'm letting people at least see verbally
[51:44.560 --> 51:51.320]  what people were like in the past if there was a threat going on I mean if you went back
[51:51.320 --> 51:56.760]  a thousand years ago and you're in some valley let's say in Europe or wherever it is in the
[51:56.760 --> 52:00.880]  world or Asia didn't matter and somebody had come through the valley that day Marauders
[52:00.880 --> 52:04.680]  and grabbed your wife and daughters and some of your kids and run off with them you'd go
[52:04.680 --> 52:08.560]  give a speech like that to the men in the village saying I know that tribe over the
[52:08.560 --> 52:12.000]  hill might be bigger than us but if we don't stand up they're never gonna stop coming and
[52:12.000 --> 52:18.160]  kidnap our family let's get our weapons and let's go get our family back and guarantee
[52:18.160 --> 52:24.120]  the speeches were just like the one you just heard and that's what a leader is and I have
[52:24.120 --> 52:29.840]  politically done everything I can in the information war in the last 20 years to wake
[52:29.840 --> 52:38.280]  up as many people to the anti-American anti-woman anti-family anti-human anti-God anti-everything
[52:38.280 --> 52:44.640]  global authoritarian system that is using Islam and socialism and communism and all
[52:44.640 --> 52:49.920]  these failed systems on purpose to screw up society and solid a control and we've even
[52:49.920 --> 52:54.800]  got all the WikiLeaks where they admit they're in a race to make you poor to control you
[52:54.800 --> 53:00.160]  that they use poverty as a weapon of course globalists can't compete with free market
[53:00.160 --> 53:05.120]  and they want monopoly so that's why they're attacking it and we've got terror attacks
[53:05.120 --> 53:10.840]  now in Paris we've got people taking hostage in Australia just today in Ramadan and they
[53:10.840 --> 53:14.800]  just say nothing to do with Islam nothing to do with Islam nothing to do with Islam
[53:14.800 --> 53:19.640]  like they're gonna tame us in the west to go along with it and like the social engineers
[53:19.640 --> 53:24.640]  are gonna tame the Islamists and make them be nice that's the useful idiots at the university
[53:24.640 --> 53:30.000]  level or at the local newscaster level let me assure you at the Pentagon level and at
[53:30.000 --> 53:33.720]  the CIA level and at the Zbigniew Brzezinski level who just died a week ago or two weeks
[53:33.720 --> 53:39.160]  ago at the Zbigniew Brzezinski level they wrote books explaining they're using Islam
[53:39.160 --> 53:43.960]  as the global destabilization force to bring in a world government and when they're done
[53:43.960 --> 53:52.000]  with it they're going to wipe out large portions of the Muslim population.
[53:52.000 --> 53:54.960]  Let's go ahead and play a clip that deals with this with the former Islamists warning
[53:54.960 --> 53:55.960]  the world.
[53:55.960 --> 54:00.880]  Former Islamic extremist Majid Nawaz Majid thank you for being here tonight it's good
[54:00.880 --> 54:04.560]  to have you with us this evening you know you listen to that list and we played the
[54:04.560 --> 54:08.440]  sound bite from our last conversation back in March when you warned that there would
[54:08.440 --> 54:13.880]  be much more to come I suppose you're sorry you were right.
[54:13.880 --> 54:19.080]  Indeed and I think we have to come to terms Martha with the fact that Europe Britain and
[54:19.080 --> 54:24.200]  the rest of Europe are in the midst of a full blown jihadist insurgency you were citing
[54:24.200 --> 54:31.320]  figures earlier that our security services are attempting to monitor around 23,000 suspected
[54:31.320 --> 54:38.280]  jihadists that by the way is out of a population in the UK of just 5% that are Muslim which
[54:38.280 --> 54:44.440]  means that 23,000 from 4 million Muslims in this country and around those 23,000 that's
[54:44.440 --> 54:49.360]  those who are jihadists around them will be those who sympathize with the ideology Islamists
[54:49.360 --> 54:54.360]  who believe in establishing a caliphate and around them those who empathize with their
[54:54.360 --> 55:00.080]  friends who happen to be Islamists if that's not insurgency levels I don't know what is.
[55:00.080 --> 55:05.560]  Yes this is a military insurgency in Europe in the UK and the answers bring more in what
[55:05.560 --> 55:11.280]  do you think was going to happen when the UN NATO the globalist seven eight years ago
[55:11.280 --> 55:18.640]  with Google with Obama this is all been in the news met up in Watford at that five star
[55:18.640 --> 55:23.320]  hotel we went and covered it and organized publicly the Arab Spring and then launched
[55:23.320 --> 55:27.680]  it with Anderson Cooper going look how liberal it is they were blowing up and burning every
[55:27.680 --> 55:33.440]  church they could get a hold of in Egypt and overthrowing our allies I sat there and watched
[55:33.440 --> 55:44.320]  CIA Anderson Cooper Robert Barron air who's gay promoting the Arab Spring in Egypt while
[55:44.320 --> 55:51.120]  they were throwing gays off buildings every hour conservatively in some cases blocks from
[55:51.120 --> 56:00.960]  where he is I mean imagine the sellout weird twisted nature of that of a robber baron toadie
[56:00.960 --> 56:06.400]  now I'm gonna go to break here and we've got a bunch of guys coming up and a ton of
[56:06.400 --> 56:15.160]  clips I haven't gotten to yet and I'm coming home it's held down now and more focused here
[56:15.160 --> 56:19.080]  but I do just want to ask the listeners to spread the word about him for wars.com only
[56:19.080 --> 56:21.760]  spread the videos the articles because they're doing everything they can to stop it they
[56:21.760 --> 56:26.280]  want to censor as they admit they are you are destroying the controlled fake press you
[56:26.280 --> 56:34.840]  are destroying the corporate media you are annihilating them and they've been somewhat
[56:34.840 --> 56:39.360]  energized in their death battle with Trump and America and nationalism but that's a dead
[56:39.360 --> 56:45.800]  cat bounce that's that's that's their death battle we just get stronger as their ideologies
[56:45.800 --> 56:51.360]  expose we have come light years exposing the unelected nature of world government that's
[56:51.360 --> 56:57.640]  why it's more important than ever that everyone support info wars by going to info or store.com
[56:57.640 --> 57:01.360]  and circumventing the establishment so that they can't get our sponsors and buying the
[57:01.360 --> 57:08.080]  highest quality private labeled many of our items are private label top best-selling brands
[57:08.080 --> 57:11.600]  they're at Whole Foods you name it we just go get the very best organic top certified
[57:11.600 --> 57:17.200]  companies around 30 40 years and then we have it private labeled and we have 25% off on average
[57:17.200 --> 57:21.920]  that's what we do we also sell the emmerks essentials line it's one of the top companies
[57:21.920 --> 57:27.800]  in the United States they let us private label it that's why the you'll you'll you'll recognize
[57:27.800 --> 57:32.520]  the packaging and it's 20% off retail with 25% off at auto ship and that is the what
[57:32.520 --> 57:37.880]  the third largest brand in Whole Foods we now private label just just an example they'll
[57:37.880 --> 57:43.840]  probably call it snake poo or snake screen because anything we sell it could be you know
[57:43.840 --> 57:49.560]  a bottle opener or a book or a t-shirt it's just evil because you aren't allowed to have
[57:49.560 --> 57:53.760]  your own funding and if other people ever figure out in media having their own funding
[57:53.760 --> 57:59.240]  with their audiences it's over for the globalist who know that they're propping up MSM and
[57:59.240 --> 58:03.840]  that know that you know Archer Daniels Midland and Lockheed have ads on mainstream news no
[58:03.840 --> 58:08.800]  one's buying you know fighter bombers for a billion and a half dollars you know who's
[58:08.800 --> 58:14.680]  watching that it's just part of their tithe to mainstream news well tithe here and get

[1:00:38.960 --> 1:00:43.920]  to paris france here is a clip from tommy robinson uk government housing radicals you
[1:00:43.920 --> 1:01:00.400]  had us on your streets so what we have is five doors down here the government is one
[1:01:00.400 --> 1:01:17.680]  of the country's most extreme radical muslims you said throw people are building he's that
[1:01:17.680 --> 1:01:22.240]  extreme and that much of potential jihadists and terrorists that the government seized
[1:01:22.240 --> 1:01:27.520]  his passport to stop him going to fight for isis in syria now they seem more concerned
[1:01:27.520 --> 1:01:32.080]  about people in syria getting hurt than they do about english people because if you have
[1:01:32.080 --> 1:01:37.200]  a look here look where they've housed him that's a primary school they've housed one
[1:01:37.200 --> 1:01:42.640]  of the country's worst and potential jihadists five doors from a children's primary school
[1:01:42.640 --> 1:01:48.720]  now i don't know how much therese are made well keep hearing amberud you keep saying
[1:01:48.720 --> 1:01:51.480]  we're all going to be alright everything's going to be alright get back to normal life
[1:01:51.480 --> 1:01:55.600]  is normal what do you mean life is normal instead kids in manchester your housing terrorists
[1:01:55.600 --> 1:01:59.840]  next to a children's your housing terrorist supporters next to a children's school not
[1:01:59.840 --> 1:02:05.120]  yours children they don't cross paths with you you drive around in bulletproof cars okay
[1:02:05.120 --> 1:02:09.280]  there are children there are kids there are families and you can put that you think you
[1:02:09.280 --> 1:02:13.520]  can just put them at risk like this the potential risk what we find with every terrorist attack
[1:02:13.520 --> 1:02:18.320]  we find that the the man that's committed it was known to the known tommy five they were
[1:02:18.320 --> 1:02:22.640]  watching him at some point just like this man is this man is one of three thousand who
[1:02:22.640 --> 1:02:27.360]  are monitored 24 hours a day seven days a week we have another 20 000 would be would be jihadists
[1:02:27.360 --> 1:02:32.080]  in our country and we simply can't afford to monitor all the time but this is one of the worst
[1:02:32.640 --> 1:02:37.040]  he has a police car outside his house he has cameras okay that's only come for the last day
[1:02:37.040 --> 1:02:40.800]  because they're aware that i'm trying to track him down usually there's no police car there
[1:02:40.800 --> 1:02:46.480]  how easy it would be for him to walk out of there with a knife and target them kids how easy is that
[1:02:46.480 --> 1:02:55.680]  you think you can stop that if you're a parent if you're a parent and your children go to this school
[1:02:56.640 --> 1:03:01.840]  how do you feel that the risk that they've been put the potential risk that's just there just there
[1:03:02.480 --> 1:03:08.000]  the potential risk and to our government if you're going to continue to think you can hide these men
[1:03:08.800 --> 1:03:12.720]  we're going to find them we're going to find them because the general public
[1:03:12.720 --> 1:03:17.840]  need to be aware of the threat they need to be aware of the risk if you've got kids in that school
[1:03:17.840 --> 1:03:23.040]  you deserve to know how extreme and that man is beyond a sex offender we look at how big our problem
[1:03:23.040 --> 1:03:28.640]  is that's dangerous three thousand muslims on 24 our day seven day a week watch but up to 20 000
[1:03:28.640 --> 1:03:33.520]  more radicals that we simply don't have the resources to watch that's up to 23 25 000 people
[1:03:33.520 --> 1:03:38.320]  okay even if we wanted to raid them and arrest them and bring them all in that would take
[1:03:38.320 --> 1:03:42.880]  hundreds of thousands of police officers it would take months and months and months
[1:03:43.520 --> 1:03:48.880]  that's how bad the problem is now now you wouldn't house a pedophile next to a school
[1:03:48.880 --> 1:03:54.080]  don't house a terrorist support with what we've seen now with with the attacks we've seen what our
[1:03:54.080 --> 1:03:56.880]  government should have been doing what we should have been hearing from you on our news is that
[1:03:56.880 --> 1:04:00.880]  you're rounding up every ISIS supporter you're rounding them up and interning them you're getting
[1:04:00.880 --> 1:04:05.520]  them off our streets not walking cross and pass with us whose mum wants to queue up and live next
[1:04:05.520 --> 1:04:13.840]  door to these men we have to live next door to him it's not right i don't know how much more you
[1:04:13.840 --> 1:04:17.760]  think as a government english men are going to tolerate when their children are being blown up
[1:04:17.760 --> 1:04:22.960]  it sort of steps it up to a next level at some point in the future you're going to create a monster
[1:04:22.960 --> 1:04:27.280]  you're going to create a monster because you need to intern these men you need to take them off our
[1:04:27.280 --> 1:04:33.280]  streets you need to protect our people you need to protect our children which you're failing at
[1:04:33.280 --> 1:04:38.560]  you're failing at and when people can no longer no longer rely on the police when they can no
[1:04:38.560 --> 1:04:43.360]  no longer rely on the government or the system people will endeavor to to seek their own justice
[1:04:43.360 --> 1:04:49.120]  justice the full videos on rebel media some info wars tony robison's on fire absolute veritas

[1:05:00.320 --> 1:05:07.280]  you might think the best ways to stop terrorism is maybe extreme vetting not allowing unbedded

[1:05:11.920 --> 1:05:17.440]  love you're all wrong in fact hillary clinton says a way to stop terrorism is to understand

[1:05:31.840 --> 1:05:35.520]  determined leadership hillary said the best way to combatting terror is to reach out to the world

[1:05:38.960 --> 1:05:43.360]  about the experiences the lives the cultures the religions the food so does this mean we

[1:08:17.840 --> 1:08:25.520]  happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that the russians
[1:08:25.520 --> 1:08:36.000]  ran an extensive information war campaign against my campaign to influence voters in the election
[1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:43.440]  and then they began to weaponize them and they began to have some of their allies within the
[1:08:44.800 --> 1:08:51.920]  internet world like info wars take out pieces and began to say the most outrageous outlandish
[1:08:51.920 --> 1:08:58.560]  absurd lies you can imagine but trump doesn't challenge these lies he actually went on jones's
[1:08:58.560 --> 1:09:07.600]  show and said your reputation is amazing i will not let you down and he has it let us down on

[1:09:32.400 --> 1:09:38.400]  of jeb bush jeb bush was polling in a single digits for most of the campaign but he got most
[1:09:38.400 --> 1:09:46.080]  the money in the first half of it this is a joke bill clinton jerry epstein's lolita express
[1:09:46.080 --> 1:09:53.840]  weiner and the and the child sexting garbage by the way we broke all that and they know it
[1:09:53.840 --> 1:10:00.000]  and they can't stand it it's in the emails sweetheart how you want to keep us dumb and in
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:09.040]  the dark and hopeless and how much you hate us we know you're a monster you chose as a lawyer
[1:10:09.600 --> 1:10:16.480]  to represent pedophiles child kidnappers and child rapists that raped little girls so hard
[1:10:16.480 --> 1:10:22.880]  hard their insides came out i've had those little girls on air that are women now
[1:10:25.120 --> 1:10:31.120]  and hillary's on tape saying she knew the clients were guilty and she laughed about it
[1:10:31.120 --> 1:10:36.160]  what type of woman represents men that grab 11 year old girls off their bicycles in arkansas
[1:10:39.200 --> 1:10:41.440]  and then what six men rape them and beat them
[1:10:41.440 --> 1:10:52.160]  so hard their insides come out that's hillary clinton remember that no i don't say horrible
[1:10:52.160 --> 1:10:59.920]  things lady i report on who you are and all the wars and all the jihadists you backed in
[1:10:59.920 --> 1:11:12.080]  syria taking over syria taking over southern syria kosovo and all the other evil things you've
[1:11:12.080 --> 1:11:16.960]  done you're a monster and you've had some of your top campaign people caught chipping in
[1:11:16.960 --> 1:11:21.360]  kids out of Haiti and then they changed their name and still run children relief funds and then
[1:11:21.360 --> 1:11:29.120]  we flew aircraft there we documented first last year the un kidnapping thousands of children
[1:11:29.120 --> 1:11:35.280]  killing hundreds the ap months after we reported it came out and confirmed it all
[1:11:38.240 --> 1:11:39.360]  and that's why they hit us
[1:11:41.920 --> 1:11:46.480]  so anybody that supports these people just remember but side you're on
[1:11:48.640 --> 1:11:50.400]  she says i have a dark heart
[1:11:52.640 --> 1:11:52.960]  lady
[1:11:52.960 --> 1:11:58.960]  you're a joke
[1:12:03.120 --> 1:12:09.920]  i was offered a million dollars three million dollars ten million dollars which is nothing
[1:12:11.600 --> 1:12:17.040]  over a decade ago and repeated offers to go be the next rush limbaugh they told me the whole plan
[1:12:17.040 --> 1:12:23.840]  basically to be glenbeck before i said no and they went in a year and had glenbeck ready
[1:12:25.120 --> 1:12:29.840]  and they went and had him study me to be the new alec shones that's why he hates me so much
[1:12:31.040 --> 1:12:36.640]  think of the level of these people oh guess what you failed you didn't stop anything
[1:12:38.880 --> 1:12:42.000]  in fact your counterfeit only brought more people to me
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:48.800]  it's like the invasion of the body snatchers you didn't get the transfer done on time
[1:12:49.360 --> 1:12:54.960]  didn't didn't go the way you wanted it to go did it and the reason i'm making about alex jones is
[1:12:54.960 --> 1:12:59.760]  they've made it about me and they think that they're having a referendum on news and nationalism
[1:12:59.760 --> 1:13:04.720]  and information on me and they think the fact that i'm real they think the fact that i don't
[1:13:04.720 --> 1:13:10.240]  back down that i tell it like it is it's some form of weakness and it's my strength and it's
[1:13:10.240 --> 1:13:15.840]  your strength to not care what they think or care what they say they're so radical in hollywood
[1:13:15.840 --> 1:13:23.200]  that they want to teach elementary students about being different sexes i mean if parents did that
[1:13:23.200 --> 1:13:27.280]  you'd say they were mentally ill or try to screw their kid up but if the government does it it's
[1:13:27.280 --> 1:13:34.160]  okay think of all that i've got stacks of news here where they're teaching at universities
[1:13:34.160 --> 1:13:38.960]  that being white is inherently evil and that white genocide is needed i'm not even looking for these
[1:13:38.960 --> 1:13:45.200]  stories i've i didn't go through all my stacks today i ran into three articles about them teaching
[1:13:45.200 --> 1:13:52.080]  white genocide at colleges the lady that they just arrested for reportedly allegedly uh leaking
[1:13:52.080 --> 1:13:59.440]  hacked information as a federal contractor the intercept i think are good guys overall reportedly
[1:13:59.440 --> 1:14:06.400]  didn't know that printer paper all has codes on it for at least 30 years secret service claim they
[1:14:06.400 --> 1:14:12.480]  wanted that to find counterfeit bills and she got caught it's on info wars.com jailed in essay leaker
[1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:23.680]  being white is terrorism that's right yes i mean talk about not being a winner that's her last
[1:14:23.680 --> 1:14:33.840]  name jailed in essay leaker being white is terrorism isn't that just amazing paul watson
[1:14:33.840 --> 1:14:38.000]  has an article on there's a bunch of other articles and then i've broken down the fact
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:42.320]  trump must seize control of the rogue government agencies they're completely out of control and
[1:14:42.320 --> 1:14:47.760]  leaking seven ways to sunday and she reportedly allegedly is just one of these people and i have
[1:14:47.760 --> 1:14:52.640]  stacks of this where i can't i'm not even looking for this news look at this report
[1:14:54.080 --> 1:15:00.240]  swedish woman prove their tolerance by having sex with refugees that's in mainstream german
[1:15:00.240 --> 1:15:04.880]  newspapers and swedish newspapers talk about new meaning to the term stockholm syndrome
[1:15:05.920 --> 1:15:09.120]  and we've shown you the video here the edited video we can't show the actual
[1:15:10.640 --> 1:15:16.480]  coitus of these women swedish particularly go to these anti-racism
[1:15:17.120 --> 1:15:25.280]  concerts put on by islamic hip-hop groups and the women literally get grabbed the men hold them down
[1:15:25.280 --> 1:15:30.240]  and then run a train on them we're 10 15 20 men riper till again they're bleeding everywhere
[1:15:30.960 --> 1:15:34.640]  and you see the faces these women while they're being raped because the guys are videotaping
[1:15:34.640 --> 1:15:41.920]  it the total horror and the dismay it looks like something out of hell they just can't believe it's
[1:15:41.920 --> 1:15:50.240]  happening and i mean should we show the footage behind me on the screen again because we just
[1:15:50.240 --> 1:15:54.640]  have the women's faces blown up we ought to run that every day just their faces they look around
[1:15:54.640 --> 1:16:00.240]  and horror as the men two men holding each arm each leg their legs spread all the way back
[1:16:00.240 --> 1:16:06.720]  and the islamicists rape rape rape rape rape rape rape rape rape no feminists talk about it
[1:16:06.720 --> 1:16:14.000]  no liberals talk about it nobody covers it because you don't do that you tell western men that they're
[1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:22.080]  not good you tell western men that they're evil you tell western men they're bad because they have
[1:16:22.080 --> 1:16:28.720]  a conscience whether they be black white hispanic of arabic descent you tell people of arabic descent
[1:16:30.080 --> 1:16:34.720]  and you they're christians low crime rate no terror one of the highest your levels of money
[1:16:34.720 --> 1:16:39.120]  making uh you name it you take them that are islamic horrible record
[1:16:41.680 --> 1:16:47.120]  because it's the culture he says it nature nurture the culture of islam is evil white
[1:16:47.120 --> 1:16:51.280]  muslims in chechnya do horrible things some of the worst and i don't want to just go off on
[1:16:51.280 --> 1:16:55.520]  some jag about muslims i was against the iraq war because it was going to go in and take out a
[1:16:55.520 --> 1:17:01.040]  secular country and put in a radical system but now the dam's broken now that they're here
[1:17:01.040 --> 1:17:06.400]  now there's thousands of known jihadis and hundreds of ongoing plots scotland yard says
[1:17:06.400 --> 1:17:10.080]  they're not allowed to stop people they know are planning terror attacks
[1:17:12.400 --> 1:17:19.440]  and then i get steven cobert making jokes about trump coming out and saying it's a travel ban
[1:17:19.440 --> 1:17:24.880]  the president has that power in the law rogue courts have blocked him his surrogates come out
[1:17:24.880 --> 1:17:28.400]  and say it's not a travel ban because they're hoping to play along with the lawyers and trumps
[1:17:28.400 --> 1:17:32.160]  like it is a travel ban and they're going to keep killing people these are from failed states that
[1:17:32.160 --> 1:17:39.120]  don't even have real passports you'd be insane to let people in from samalia though i mean it is the
[1:17:39.120 --> 1:17:47.760]  best case point to show nexus libya nexus sedan these are literal insane asylums where women
[1:17:47.760 --> 1:17:56.880]  are kept in cages these people it's like taking a crazy caveman out of some crazy death call from
[1:17:56.880 --> 1:18:02.960]  another era and teleporting them into the middle of los angeles or new york city it's insane and
[1:18:02.960 --> 1:18:14.800]  they don't reform they crap on the sidewalk right in front of you good lord and trump has responded
[1:18:14.800 --> 1:18:19.040]  i saying no it is a travel ban we come back i'm going to play that uh just briefly

[1:24:20.640 --> 1:24:27.280]  now Stephen Colbert is an actor who has 19 writers 17 of which are men but he lectures us
[1:24:27.280 --> 1:24:33.600]  all day how america's sex is sin bad but islam's good and he makes little you know little jokes
[1:24:33.600 --> 1:24:37.360]  all day about how trump doesn't like women and all his other made-up stuff but never talks about
[1:24:38.240 --> 1:24:43.040]  epstein and his lelita express and the pedophilia he makes jokes about umma abadine and stuff i've
[1:24:43.040 --> 1:24:48.320]  said when her husband you know is pled guilty to his his you know pedophile type behavior
[1:24:48.320 --> 1:24:55.680]  you're a sex offender so everything we co-bear he's about deception and about his writers trying
[1:24:55.680 --> 1:24:59.680]  to prey on the american people i mean this is literal psychological warfare aimed at you and your
[1:24:59.680 --> 1:25:09.280]  family and he sits there and attacks the president for infrastructure like the president's putting
[1:25:09.280 --> 1:25:15.360]  us down the united states has some of the worst railways in the world were worse than mexico
[1:25:15.360 --> 1:25:19.040]  or some of the third world countries it's a fact our roads are falling apart in some areas our
[1:25:19.040 --> 1:25:23.600]  bridges are falling apart this is the fact trump's trying to ram through the biggest infrastructure
[1:25:23.600 --> 1:25:28.160]  spending ever and that'll actually create jobs too it's a win-win it's one of the purest forms of
[1:25:28.160 --> 1:25:33.360]  things that government can really do that work something good that uh roosevelt did i give him
[1:25:33.360 --> 1:25:39.600]  credit for that i mean this works okay this is a roosevelt type deal so i call trump the real
[1:25:39.600 --> 1:25:45.680]  liberal the blue collar billionaire and he makes a big joke about it that oh and he won't tell us
[1:25:45.680 --> 1:25:51.440]  what country it is because we don't want those countries and companies to know we want it because
[1:25:51.440 --> 1:25:55.040]  we want to bid and get a better deal on it he knows it's going to cost a lot of money to get
[1:25:55.040 --> 1:26:00.480]  this these systems but they go oh but he'll tell the russians everything what that there were
[1:26:00.480 --> 1:26:06.720]  laptop bombs two months after it was on the news that's another lie so when you know everything
[1:26:06.720 --> 1:26:12.880]  cobert saying is written by writers sentence by sentence crafted in boardrooms every day for hours
[1:26:12.880 --> 1:26:17.440]  on how to deceive you he then reads off a teleprompter and everybody talks about what a genius he is
[1:26:19.920 --> 1:26:23.920]  it's sick so here's the president there's cobert
[1:26:26.320 --> 1:26:31.760]  very excited trump is still trying to push his muslim travel ban remember uh he had that executive
[1:26:31.760 --> 1:26:36.320]  order he signed showed everybody and then there is a democratic court then it was rewritten to be
[1:26:36.320 --> 1:26:41.440]  a little softer and then it was struck down again well now a revised version is headed to the supreme
[1:26:41.440 --> 1:26:48.480]  court and the administration's only chance of winning is not calling it a travel ban tell my
[1:26:48.480 --> 1:26:55.040]  son it's not a travel ban because when we use words like travel ban that misrepresents what it is
[1:26:55.040 --> 1:27:02.000]  got it got it okay so this thing should get approved by the supreme court as long as nobody
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:09.200]  calls it a travel ban people the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want but i am
[1:27:09.200 --> 1:27:22.800]  calling it what we need and what it is a travel ban come on
[1:27:23.840 --> 1:27:27.200]  now let's just pause for a moment because i'm going to go back to the travel
[1:27:27.200 --> 1:27:32.480]  ban when a little bit later we have two clips we play the travel ban but it's all bull these are
[1:27:32.480 --> 1:27:39.360]  countries failed states and somalia libya that our governments have helped fail the democratic
[1:27:39.360 --> 1:27:43.040]  party particularly and and and then now they're coming here and killing people and then he's making
[1:27:43.040 --> 1:27:47.840]  fun of the president because he is being truthful he's not spinning like his press secretary that's
[1:27:47.840 --> 1:27:52.720]  refreshing it is a travel ban on those failed states because they're not real countries is
[1:27:52.720 --> 1:27:58.720]  lamas is crazies are they're giving passports to known terrorists now back to infrastructure
[1:27:59.680 --> 1:28:05.040]  our infrastructure is falling apart and the air traffic controller systems we have are admittedly
[1:28:05.040 --> 1:28:14.480]  some of the worst in the world it's a crisis trump wants to fix that and so he's a bad guy here it is
[1:28:14.480 --> 1:28:23.440]  the white house announced today that they're kicking off infrastructure week it's it's like shark week
[1:28:23.440 --> 1:28:32.080]  except american infrastructure might actually kill you exactly a week of focusing on our infrastructure
[1:28:32.080 --> 1:28:37.280]  a week of innovating america we used to be about that cobert not about worshiping hollywood no bodies
[1:28:37.280 --> 1:28:43.200]  like you let's finish up and it started with trump's plan to turn the air traffic control
[1:28:43.200 --> 1:28:49.440]  functions of the f a a into a nonprofit corporation although to be fair any company trump runs
[1:28:49.440 --> 1:28:57.280]  eventually is a nonprofit really our economy is exploding that's job number since 1984
[1:28:58.960 --> 1:29:06.560]  huge stock market fans here and donald trump defended the plan we're proposing reduced wait times
[1:29:06.560 --> 1:29:15.920]  increased route efficiency and far fewer delays our plan will get you where you need to go more
[1:29:15.920 --> 1:29:25.440]  quickly more reliably more affordably plus more legroom and and the whole can of apple juice
[1:29:27.440 --> 1:29:32.480]  and then they go on to attack him and make it a big joke that you know america is just fine and
[1:29:32.480 --> 1:29:36.960]  our infrastructure is great and you know how you know how dare trump be putting it down i mean i mean
[1:29:36.960 --> 1:29:43.120]  this is just they will attack anything and everything he does three trillion in the stock market
[1:29:43.120 --> 1:29:47.920]  hundreds of billions of new jobs millions of new people getting jobs people have no hope again
[1:29:47.920 --> 1:29:53.360]  and they're there trying to kill it at every step of the way because they hate america hollywood
[1:29:53.360 --> 1:29:58.560]  and the east coast elite are disconnected gcn radio network space aliens i mean they're
[1:29:58.560 --> 1:30:04.800]  a couple of space aliens are from another planet you might think the best ways to stop terrorism
[1:30:04.800 --> 1:30:09.680]  is maybe extreme bedding not allowing unbedded refugees into your home maybe not trying to do
[1:30:09.680 --> 1:30:14.960]  so many regime changes in middle eastern countries but you're all wrong in fact hillary clinton says
[1:30:14.960 --> 1:30:19.840]  a way to stop terrorism is to understand other cultures and their food yes really she also
[1:30:19.840 --> 1:30:24.800]  defended london mayor city con the man who once represented 911 al-qaeda member zacharias misali
[1:30:24.800 --> 1:30:29.280]  called moderate muslim's uncle tom's and said terrorism was part and parcel to living in a
[1:30:29.280 --> 1:30:33.520]  major city and she added con has shown steady determined leadership hillary said the best
[1:30:33.520 --> 1:30:37.120]  way to combatting terror is to reach out to the world in order to understand people living in
[1:30:37.120 --> 1:30:40.880]  foreign countries getting to know one another learning about the experiences the lives the
[1:30:40.880 --> 1:30:45.600]  cultures the religions the food so does this mean we got to be like into stoning women cutting off
[1:30:45.600 --> 1:30:49.440]  their genitals and throwing gaze off buildings this is not a time to lash out to incite fear to
[1:30:49.440 --> 1:30:53.920]  use tragedy and terror for political gain said clinton a comment obviously aimed at donald trump
[1:30:53.920 --> 1:30:57.680]  and anyone else was correctly identified political correctness and tolerance of islam as creating
[1:30:57.680 --> 1:31:01.280]  a fertile ground for terrorist attacks in the western world rob your reporting for info wars

[1:32:16.240 --> 1:32:21.440]  knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride the bad member of the halogen
[1:32:21.440 --> 1:32:26.640]  family into the water they took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in and when the

[1:32:48.960 --> 1:32:54.480]  deal folks and the truth is that iodine is essential in my view to any optimum health regimen

[1:33:25.200 --> 1:33:32.720]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[1:33:37.360 --> 1:33:42.480]  right and wrong a new world order
[1:33:42.480 --> 1:33:56.320]  we see more religion of peace celebrations mexicans like to eat enchiladas and have fun and
[1:33:56.320 --> 1:34:06.240]  shoot fireworks and drink tequila and beer on their holidays and hit pinatas and well if you
[1:34:06.240 --> 1:34:11.760]  talk about white folks around here we like doing the same thing on holidays or the fourth of july
[1:34:11.760 --> 1:34:17.040]  same thing eat eat eat eat eat enchiladas or hamburgers or steaks and shoot fireworks off in the
[1:34:17.040 --> 1:34:24.160]  air and pretty much everybody else like you go to thailand or you go to china uh or you go to
[1:34:24.160 --> 1:34:30.640]  russia or you go to brazil you go to japan they like doing the same thing on their holidays
[1:34:30.640 --> 1:34:36.720]  it's pretty much the same deal get together eat food have a few drinks light some lanterns off shoot
[1:34:36.720 --> 1:34:43.840]  them up with sky whatever not with islam why during the month of ramadan we always see tens of
[1:34:43.840 --> 1:34:47.680]  thousands of christians killed all over the world hundreds and hundreds killed in the west
[1:34:48.960 --> 1:34:53.040]  and so george soros of the un they had a plan they said just bring them in en masse
[1:34:56.080 --> 1:34:59.280]  bring the folks in that can't even live with each other in peace in their own countries
[1:35:00.800 --> 1:35:06.320]  and everything will turn out just wonderfully and now we've got people taking hostage in australia
[1:35:06.320 --> 1:35:11.280]  by people screaming this is for a la so i guess they got tired of a la akbar now it's this is for
[1:35:11.280 --> 1:35:15.920]  a la and the same thing happened with this attack on a cop with a hammer so the cops hurt and the
[1:35:15.920 --> 1:35:21.360]  jihadi's been shot you've got the london bridge and the lion of london bridge the guy that took on
[1:35:21.360 --> 1:35:25.680]  the three guys they come in they start stabbing everybody and one guy they call him a football
[1:35:25.680 --> 1:35:31.200]  hooligan 47 year old guy gets up and starts fighting him until the police get there and he
[1:35:31.200 --> 1:35:35.120]  gets stabbed in the neck and stabbed in the chest and stabbed in the arms and some liberals are
[1:35:35.120 --> 1:35:40.160]  calling for him to be arrested for a hate crime i'm not kidding they charge you in england if you
[1:35:40.160 --> 1:35:45.760]  fight back in fact um our guest who is a hero ladies and gentlemen has been put in jail before
[1:35:45.760 --> 1:35:53.040]  tommy robbins of the rebel dot media on twitter t robbins new arab amazing guy uh everybody loves him
[1:35:53.600 --> 1:35:56.960]  i remember thinking he was a radical 10 years ago when i first learned about him paul watson
[1:35:56.960 --> 1:36:00.400]  of course really introduced him to me on air show out ignorant i am the last few years
[1:36:00.400 --> 1:36:04.240]  as you start following his work thank god he now actually makes documentaries and
[1:36:04.240 --> 1:36:09.200]  does news we can see who he is not what the media says about him this is all part of
[1:36:09.200 --> 1:36:14.320]  a process as we all learn how lied to we've been and and and how we want to be politically correct
[1:36:14.320 --> 1:36:18.320]  even if we're libertarians we want to you know try to live and let live well if people don't want
[1:36:18.320 --> 1:36:23.520]  to live and let live with us it's suicide to go along with it and so i'm done the greatest victims
[1:36:23.520 --> 1:36:30.320]  of islam are islam are the people in it and folks across the uk are fed up with it so
[1:36:30.320 --> 1:36:35.360]  he joins us more and more unfortunately used to be every month if there'd be a terror attack
[1:36:35.360 --> 1:36:39.760]  it'd be on now it's every couple days in the uk we almost just forget about him and that's
[1:36:39.760 --> 1:36:44.320]  what con the mayor said don't let trump come he said today you know he's the problem and
[1:36:44.320 --> 1:36:48.400]  he said we should just get used to these terror attacks and then it's no big deal and then it's
[1:36:48.400 --> 1:36:54.000]  not islam that's the london stand mayor of it said if the if the brexit doesn't let more muslims in
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:59.120]  he'll just block it himself he'll block the government and just bring him in he's in sedition
[1:36:59.120 --> 1:37:04.480]  but he's the good cop bad cop thing so tommy robbins joins us a new video he goes to these
[1:37:04.480 --> 1:37:08.240]  mosques where they're radicalizing these very people he confronts them he shows where they
[1:37:08.240 --> 1:37:13.120]  live people that are calling for jihad of the death live right next to the schools and that's
[1:37:13.120 --> 1:37:18.880]  what muslims target the weakest they want it to be the most heinous like gingis khan would do he
[1:37:18.880 --> 1:37:24.000]  wasn't a muslim but the same thing because it creates a terror it drives you out that's what
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:29.440]  the prophet muhammad said you should do peace be upon him because there's the piece of total
[1:37:29.440 --> 1:37:35.600]  submission so the the religion of peace strikes again but again none of this has anything to do
[1:37:35.600 --> 1:37:44.000]  with islam so tommy robbins said just crazy to see this unfolding hi alex where do you want to
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:49.600]  begin because give us the numbers the facts what's going on the numbers 500 ongoing plots
[1:37:49.600 --> 1:37:57.200]  scotland yard says it is that accurate 500 open investigations the plots um three plots which
[1:37:57.200 --> 1:38:03.760]  you've seen which is the west minister attack by collie mesud the most most recent one london bridge
[1:38:03.760 --> 1:38:09.840]  and then the attack on the children's concert in mancha sun and five failed attempts in the last
[1:38:09.840 --> 1:38:17.280]  three months we have over 3000 muslims on 24 hour day seven day a week watch our potential
[1:38:17.280 --> 1:38:23.680]  threat to us and we have up to 23 to 25 000 muslims who are on the terror watch that's the reality of
[1:38:23.680 --> 1:38:30.080]  where we're at um terrorism offences go up 60 every year so what we need to understand and
[1:38:30.080 --> 1:38:35.680]  everyone needs to understand is this problem's not getting better i remember david cameron
[1:38:35.680 --> 1:38:40.480]  after leaving being with the head it's a member of our military on the streets of london david
[1:38:40.480 --> 1:38:45.040]  cameron set up a government task force he come out the next day lights reason he's just done he
[1:38:45.040 --> 1:38:50.880]  come out with this big speech about we will now combat this extremism we have this five-year plan
[1:38:52.000 --> 1:38:57.120]  i remember sitting there at the time saying it's gonna be a lot worse in five years because you
[1:38:57.120 --> 1:39:02.320]  still have not even named the problem you don't identify the problem now in that five years of
[1:39:02.320 --> 1:39:08.560]  whilst david cameron had this big plan in that five years four times as many muslims joined
[1:39:08.560 --> 1:39:14.480]  isis then have ever signed up to the british military we've allowed in excess of 500 of them
[1:39:14.480 --> 1:39:19.840]  who have been trained in syria they've been out there already they've been raping pillaging
[1:39:19.840 --> 1:39:25.600]  murdering murdering they're now back walking around our streets i've actually been looking at the
[1:39:25.600 --> 1:39:30.480]  whereabouts trying to find some of them this week one of them is working in a car park as a car park
[1:39:30.480 --> 1:39:36.800]  attendant at a hospital in the uk um the most recent that video that he's showing there that
[1:39:36.800 --> 1:39:43.760]  most recent video that man's name is abu halima okay he's one of the most radical extremists
[1:39:43.760 --> 1:39:52.240]  in our country he was working as a bus driver alex a bus driver in london so at any point that he
[1:39:52.240 --> 1:39:57.360]  wanted to ram that bus into wherever he could he could have but that obviously there's a government
[1:39:57.360 --> 1:40:01.920]  to put him on a watch list one of the top watch lists they know he's a threat they're fully aware
[1:40:01.920 --> 1:40:06.640]  of what a threat is to us why don't they also why don't we give him a uh a jet pilots license maybe
[1:40:06.640 --> 1:40:12.720]  he can fly seven seven sevens this this is how ludicrous it doesn't sound believable does it
[1:40:12.720 --> 1:40:18.320]  they also gave him they also went into his house they seized his passport because they knew he was
[1:40:18.320 --> 1:40:24.160]  going to try and fight jihad in syria so when you take away a muslim's passport you prevent him from
[1:40:24.160 --> 1:40:31.120]  going we know he wants to fight jihad we that is leaving a ticking time bomb waiting to explode
[1:40:31.120 --> 1:40:37.120]  now as we've seen recently it's exploding on children and most recently innocent women sitting
[1:40:37.120 --> 1:40:43.520]  in having a restaurant in london have had knives plowed into their neck okay now so we know this
[1:40:43.520 --> 1:40:49.680]  man's a danger and when i track him down and find out where he is they've housed him in a lovely area
[1:40:50.640 --> 1:40:57.920]  with our money next to our kids in a school so even i understand because there was an attack
[1:40:57.920 --> 1:41:01.680]  after the last west minister bridge attack there was another attack stopped where they've
[1:41:01.680 --> 1:41:06.240]  been following this muslim for three four months and they followed him and he had a bag full of
[1:41:06.240 --> 1:41:10.640]  knives and he just got to parliament where it was just about to attack someone and they jumped out
[1:41:10.640 --> 1:41:16.240]  and arrested him yeah so in that in those circumstances you're okay you can monitor them
[1:41:16.240 --> 1:41:21.920]  and arrest them where he lives he has to climb over his back garden and he's in the children's
[1:41:21.920 --> 1:41:29.600]  playground you can't stop that you they cannot stop that so that the danger they're putting us in
[1:41:29.600 --> 1:41:35.520]  as a public is an absolute liberty that the government are doing this these men that especially
[1:41:35.520 --> 1:41:39.360]  the ones who have been fighting for ices all the ones on the terror watch this what you find out
[1:41:39.360 --> 1:41:44.480]  again you've i've found out again one of these london bridge attackers was a failed asylum seeker
[1:41:44.480 --> 1:41:49.600]  what's he doing here what is he doing here not only is there a failed asylum seeker one of the
[1:41:49.600 --> 1:41:54.800]  other ones appeared on a documentary 12 months ago called the jihadi next door they're walking
[1:41:54.800 --> 1:42:00.400]  around our streets so let's be clear they're launching more and more attacks ices said three
[1:42:00.400 --> 1:42:05.440]  years ago we're going to flood europe and the uk with millions and inside those millions of refugees
[1:42:05.440 --> 1:42:08.880]  we have hundreds of thousands of operatives and then we're going to have the sleeper cells
[1:42:08.880 --> 1:42:16.720]  activate and we see exponentially them activating here europe australia russia and when russia gets
[1:42:16.720 --> 1:42:20.880]  bombed our media actually goes oh you're bad you deserve it i mean there is like an alliance
[1:42:20.880 --> 1:42:26.560]  with the left in islam that you and others have been exposing for a long time a david horror
[1:42:26.560 --> 1:42:33.040]  which you name it and they're in the news and then i have media say i'm a conspiracy theorist
[1:42:33.040 --> 1:42:39.120]  jones believes europe is knowingly bringing an ices when merkel and others advertise come here
[1:42:39.120 --> 1:42:45.840]  put you up a government housing pay for you put you in nice areas kick pensioners out of their
[1:42:45.840 --> 1:42:52.480]  section eight housing in sweden in germany in denmark in finland i mean you cannot in italy
[1:42:52.480 --> 1:42:57.360]  i there's countless footage of old people in stopping throwing other houses hotels being
[1:42:57.360 --> 1:43:04.080]  the the paying customers thrown out and asylum seekers that have been shuttled in on george
[1:43:04.080 --> 1:43:12.480]  soros boats literally from the coast of libya brought into the country what is the master plan
[1:43:12.480 --> 1:43:18.800]  a then b where do you see this going because i said this in the last hour and i said it to
[1:43:18.800 --> 1:43:23.280]  create a controversy i said people that are known ices fighters that have killed people that have
[1:43:23.280 --> 1:43:27.200]  raped women that have murdered they all post videos of it why are you letting them back in
[1:43:27.200 --> 1:43:31.200]  why are you giving them government jobs why are you putting police cars outside their houses to
[1:43:31.200 --> 1:43:35.200]  quote protect them like you just showed in the video we aired before you came on it's on info
[1:43:35.200 --> 1:43:44.240]  wars dot com and on rebel media when you look at this i'm saying they should be tried for their
[1:43:44.240 --> 1:43:49.520]  crimes against humanity just like nazis at nuremberg they should be executed and if they're convicted
[1:43:49.520 --> 1:43:54.480]  i will kick the lever saying i'm willing to stand up to them i'm sick of this and you've got these
[1:43:54.480 --> 1:44:01.280]  guys 80 on welfare literally wearing women's nightgowns walking around uh wearing diapers uh
[1:44:01.280 --> 1:44:07.520]  not working usually weighing 400 pounds bitching at everyone with their big greasy beards just running
[1:44:07.520 --> 1:44:12.560]  around i mean it's disgusting then it's a joke and then their women are wearing hoods that are
[1:44:12.560 --> 1:44:18.240]  kept in cages at home and i'm just sick of them so i literally i don't want violence what i'm saying
[1:44:18.240 --> 1:44:22.480]  is they're bringing in violent groups they've domesticated that out of a whole pub of like
[1:44:22.480 --> 1:44:27.120]  a hundred people one guy went and started trying to fight back and then the media calls him a wild
[1:44:27.120 --> 1:44:35.440]  man i mean what planet are we on and the maddest part of all of that is that we're paying for them
[1:44:36.480 --> 1:44:42.320]  we are actually paying for all of this ourselves and our tax payers money we keep hearing we're in
[1:44:42.320 --> 1:44:46.400]  election campaign there's an election on thursday we keep hearing about the shortage of police
[1:44:46.400 --> 1:44:53.440]  those 3000 men to monitor one of them cost two million pounds yeah to monitor one of them a year
[1:44:54.080 --> 1:45:02.800]  now it takes three sets of nine men each day to monitor them that's 27 officers a day times by
[1:45:02.800 --> 1:45:09.600]  3000 and we've got a shortage of police we've got a shortage of money now let's also talk about
[1:45:09.600 --> 1:45:13.520]  what percentage of the burnt effects are muslims babies because the inbreeding and
[1:45:13.520 --> 1:45:18.320]  what percentage of the crime i mean it's like take the most barbarous inbred insane people
[1:45:18.320 --> 1:45:22.080]  bring them into one of the most beautiful places one of the freest places in the world
[1:45:22.080 --> 1:45:30.560]  and turn into a giant open sewer three percent of britain is pakistani 33 percent of all child
[1:45:30.560 --> 1:45:38.960]  defects are pakistani that's what we've employed um the cost again well like i said the terrorism
[1:45:38.960 --> 1:45:43.600]  all of these things but the cost to our country when we're going about and old people are going out
[1:45:43.600 --> 1:45:51.040]  well everyone's moaning about the cutbacks and the financial problems that the country's having
[1:45:51.600 --> 1:45:55.680]  and then we look at what money was spending which we even when you go on about the inbreeding
[1:45:56.320 --> 1:46:02.320]  why where's 2017 we're fully aware of the problems when a cousin marries a cousin
[1:46:02.320 --> 1:46:09.040]  why are we allowing upwards of i think it's upwards to 70 percent in one city in in england
[1:46:09.040 --> 1:46:14.160]  called brudford upwards of 70 percent of them are married to first cousins what are we allowing this
[1:46:14.720 --> 1:46:18.960]  well well we know why it happens because muhammad did it so because the prophet muhammad did it
[1:46:18.960 --> 1:46:23.600]  and we know that everything he did was perfect then if he if he married his cousin you can marry
[1:46:23.600 --> 1:46:29.040]  his cousin if he said sleep over six married a six-year-old and rape on she's nine you can
[1:46:29.040 --> 1:46:35.760]  all the problems again all the problems come back even when we look at the the the thoughts of the
[1:46:35.760 --> 1:46:41.520]  british muslim community we see that 66 percent of them would not report on another muslim who was
[1:46:41.520 --> 1:46:48.160]  going to fight or join isis terrorism 66 percent now why is that and because of the scripture in
[1:46:48.160 --> 1:46:51.280]  the Quran that tells them they can never slide or go against the muslim because they end up in
[1:46:51.280 --> 1:46:55.120]  alpha and by the way tell us about this guy that has police protection you just showed a few days
[1:46:55.120 --> 1:47:00.400]  ago he's walking around the video saying what do you do to gays i throw him off buildings i mean
[1:47:00.400 --> 1:47:06.000]  this guy just is saying he wants to do all this and he's not even from the uk and they won't get
[1:47:06.000 --> 1:47:11.360]  rid of him obviously we had to cut that video in certain pits but there's also things he says
[1:47:11.360 --> 1:47:16.960]  where he basically admits that yeah i support isis basically sits there in a minute so when he had
[1:47:16.960 --> 1:47:22.880]  no there was no police protection there until i went to his house yeah so once i've gone to his house
[1:47:22.880 --> 1:47:28.640]  which is when i spoke to the police officer i said so let me get this clear yesterday you
[1:47:28.640 --> 1:47:33.520]  weren't sat here so if he wanted to walk out of his house and he's a danger which we know he is
[1:47:34.400 --> 1:47:38.880]  to any of the people living on this road or any of those school children in that playgrounds
[1:47:38.880 --> 1:47:43.120]  you weren't here the police you were not here to protect us but now that i'm here
[1:47:44.080 --> 1:47:50.560]  here you are to protect him do you know how insane that is don't how ridiculous and again
[1:47:50.560 --> 1:47:55.120]  this is us paying for it why you know how hard it is to get a police officer in the uk
[1:47:55.600 --> 1:48:01.600]  it's for crimes and here they are guarding an isis supporting scumbag terrorists who should not even
[1:48:01.600 --> 1:48:07.040]  be breathing the same air as us that's where we're at and um and it's so frustrating because this
[1:48:07.040 --> 1:48:11.680]  isn't a one-off this is happening across our country they are literally housing g-hardest next
[1:48:11.680 --> 1:48:17.280]  to our schools with our kids and we're supposed to and when you say where is it leading i don't
[1:48:17.280 --> 1:48:22.800]  i don't wish for anything but i have to in all honesty my phone has not stopped and it's not
[1:48:22.800 --> 1:48:27.440]  stopped with every sort of character across the whole country who is demanding some sort of action
[1:48:27.440 --> 1:48:33.680]  and some sort of path or some sort of um some sort of guidance in what to do because and what
[1:48:33.680 --> 1:48:38.960]  they're going to do and i'll say in that video you're going to create a monster because when the
[1:48:38.960 --> 1:48:43.840]  police fail and the state and the system fails to protect its citizens which it's doing now right
[1:48:43.840 --> 1:48:48.240]  now it's fails there's no argument about it they have got blood on their hands that most recent
[1:48:48.240 --> 1:48:51.360]  attack if they didn't listen to what we've been asking them if they didn't listen to the laws
[1:48:51.360 --> 1:48:56.240]  would have been demanding them to be implemented for almost a decade then these people would be alive
[1:48:56.800 --> 1:49:00.800]  that's it there's no it's from let me expand on where you think this is going to go because look
[1:49:00.800 --> 1:49:06.560]  at paris they're reporting that their tourism is down by half the last few years 80 on the decade
[1:49:06.560 --> 1:49:10.800]  i sent a crew there last year there were no go zones all over the place we went to brussels belgium
[1:49:10.800 --> 1:49:16.800]  no go zones everywhere the muslims are so aggressive so hateful they won't give you service at
[1:49:16.800 --> 1:49:23.920]  restaurants gas stations uh taxi drivers more and more there is a there is a g hot on and they admit
[1:49:23.920 --> 1:49:30.000]  that france is going bankrupt because of this but they don't care they won't stop it's this commitment
[1:49:30.000 --> 1:49:34.800]  so so where is this going to go because i've talked to so many folks we've had on from the uk the
[1:49:34.800 --> 1:49:38.800]  fellow that caught the video of cnn doing the fake press conference with the muslims saying they
[1:49:38.800 --> 1:49:43.600]  were sorry which of course was all fake because they don't do that and he said him and his girlfriend
[1:49:43.600 --> 1:49:48.000]  won't go out now during ramadan because they knew this would happen and this is what's going on
[1:49:49.520 --> 1:49:55.520]  so the security and the stability that we enjoyed as a generation and the previous generation
[1:49:56.080 --> 1:50:02.480]  growing up we're handing it away so our children will not enjoy those freedoms our children in
[1:50:02.480 --> 1:50:07.840]  years to come the the simple things of going to a pop concert which we take for granted
[1:50:07.840 --> 1:50:12.720]  will not be the same for the next generation people going out and enjoying themselves people going
[1:50:12.720 --> 1:50:18.400]  out into bars there will be an install of fear and that comes down to that comes down to strike fear
[1:50:18.400 --> 1:50:22.880]  into the heart of the disbeliever again scriptural in the caran 12 a that's why they target little
[1:50:22.880 --> 1:50:27.680]  girls little boys that's why they eat hearts that's why they want to be as nasty as possible
[1:50:27.680 --> 1:50:31.600]  in that videos of six-year-old boys killing people is is to strike fear in our hearts and
[1:50:31.600 --> 1:50:37.120]  terrorize us into submission and terrorize us i see i see we're not far off i've been saying that
[1:50:37.120 --> 1:50:43.920]  for years we weren't far off the young children but also just just starting on the end of one road
[1:50:43.920 --> 1:50:48.080]  and going into the houses and killing every people in the road yeah and when they do that
[1:50:48.080 --> 1:50:53.120]  just some point i believe they will when they do that the whole country and they're going to bed
[1:50:53.120 --> 1:50:57.280]  that night it's a door lot it's a door lot everyone will be worried everyone will be fearful stay
[1:50:57.280 --> 1:51:02.080]  there let's talk about the time bomb what you're warning of right now with tommy robinson it's
[1:51:02.080 --> 1:51:08.480]  been said any society is only three missed meals away from chaos those times may be near think about
[1:51:08.480 --> 1:51:13.920]  it our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from russia and north korea social
[1:51:13.920 --> 1:51:19.200]  unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns and a crumbling
[1:51:19.200 --> 1:51:24.320]  infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack
[1:51:24.320 --> 1:51:28.640]  when the chaos from any one of these threats arises the government knows it can't provide
[1:51:28.640 --> 1:51:34.000]  during a widespread national emergency that's why you need your own plan for self-reliance

[1:56:12.400 --> 1:56:17.600]  in a state of going along with this garbage they are in a trance we've got to shock them out of it
[1:56:17.600 --> 1:56:25.040]  before it explodes too big so tommy robinson one of the main leaders globally uh exposing the you
[1:56:25.040 --> 1:56:30.400]  know the true threat of islam how it says in the quran lay low act like you're nice till your numbers
[1:56:30.400 --> 1:56:34.880]  get big enough then let attacks happen play the part of the good cop to lull them in until your
[1:56:34.880 --> 1:56:42.400]  numbers are high enough where does this end if people don't stand up but but you but you were
[1:56:42.400 --> 1:56:47.600]  getting the main point when you warn folks about a blow-up how do you see this happening what is
[1:56:47.600 --> 1:56:52.880]  the breaking point when the government disarms the people then brings in an outside third world
[1:56:52.880 --> 1:56:58.160]  cult-like piranha force who are now enforcing syria law on the streets kidnapping little girls
[1:56:58.160 --> 1:57:04.800]  everywhere murdering everybody what do you do i mean what do you see coming i see us getting close to
[1:57:05.360 --> 1:57:10.880]  i don't think the situation in france i don't think i think england would be different i can
[1:57:10.880 --> 1:57:16.800]  see a point where english men are going to react and react en masse and i'd say by the phone calls
[1:57:16.800 --> 1:57:24.480]  i've been receiving all week that they're pushing the point close already um i don't see any we have
[1:57:24.480 --> 1:57:30.160]  no there is no no reasonable solution to this with the problems they've imported we all know that so
[1:57:30.160 --> 1:57:35.200]  to get through this and to bring the change we need there's going to be chaos either way because if
[1:57:35.200 --> 1:57:39.600]  we try to enforce the laws that we already have which should be enforced upon that community in
[1:57:39.600 --> 1:57:44.880]  order to bring about that change there's going to be huge chaos from them riots on mass levels
[1:57:44.880 --> 1:57:50.640]  and if they ignore them and they continue to allow it go this way i can see them creating english
[1:57:50.640 --> 1:57:56.800]  bombers that's what they're going to do they're going to do that and um and again just i look at
[1:57:56.800 --> 1:58:00.560]  it as a father of three it's just there's no there's no light at the end of the tunnel here
[1:58:01.120 --> 1:58:05.440]  for anyone so when people get desperate on that which is why i keep saying it's like it's like
[1:58:05.440 --> 1:58:10.800]  they're forcing people down that path that's how i see it till you till you address the issue
[1:58:10.800 --> 1:58:15.680]  and you show people hope and when the system fails again alex i'll bring you back to a
[1:58:15.680 --> 1:58:21.440]  situation so there's a situation in a city called lester lester is um just north of where i live
[1:58:21.440 --> 1:58:26.800]  and there this is a sick community there was a young sick girl who was gang raped by muslim men
[1:58:26.800 --> 1:58:30.960]  so the family went to the police the police actually just like they used to always do
[1:58:30.960 --> 1:58:36.000]  they refused to do anything so then tell me around this and stay there we're back in 70

[2:00:25.280 --> 2:00:29.200]  from trying to pull us out of it the uk discovered they were under the unelected e u they never had
[2:00:29.200 --> 2:00:34.640]  to vote in that they're pulling out all the stuff that was fringe you know 20 years ago
[2:00:34.640 --> 2:00:39.120]  it's now mainstream now and donald trump is blowing big holes in the globalist operation
[2:00:39.120 --> 2:00:44.080]  final segment we have with this amazing gas tommy robinson my website's info wars dot com
[2:00:44.080 --> 2:00:50.480]  our backups prison planet dot com can follow him on twitter at t robinson new era and again
[2:00:50.480 --> 2:00:55.280]  his book is enemy of the state i want to carry his book i know it's been out for a year or so
[2:00:55.280 --> 2:01:00.160]  and i want to you know really uh focus on what he's doing on the reporting he's doing for rebel
[2:01:00.160 --> 2:01:04.000]  media because it's groundbreaking and he has a lot of courage i don't have time to get the
[2:01:04.000 --> 2:01:07.040]  whole story of what he's been through to bring you this information but let's just say this
[2:01:07.040 --> 2:01:11.760]  freedom's not free uh so we got four minutes left i appreciate your time other key points your
[2:01:11.760 --> 2:01:17.440]  predictions you were telling the story about the family going to the police we're about to speak so
[2:01:17.440 --> 2:01:22.400]  the seats went to the police and the police done nothing so then what happened which is what will
[2:01:22.400 --> 2:01:28.800]  happen in this circumstance as well seats went into become vigilantes and 20 to 30 seat men
[2:01:28.800 --> 2:01:34.080]  found the groomers the men that were raping the girl they found them they attacked them they attacked
[2:01:34.080 --> 2:01:38.640]  their businesses they attacked their properties what then happened because of that the police then
[2:01:38.640 --> 2:01:43.840]  arrested the muslims for gang raping the girl then and only then because of that vigilantism
[2:01:43.840 --> 2:01:48.480]  and then the 20 seat men were sent to prison but the only reason why the steaks had to do that
[2:01:48.480 --> 2:01:53.360]  was because the system failed now if the government and the police continue to fail English people
[2:01:53.360 --> 2:01:58.640]  in our country they continue to put our children at risk to bombs uh put our women at risk to rape
[2:01:58.640 --> 2:02:03.120]  then i'm unfortunately that is what you're going to see you're going to see English men getting
[2:02:03.120 --> 2:02:07.040]  together you're going to see see them finding where these men are finding where they are and
[2:02:07.040 --> 2:02:10.720]  taking the law into our own hands and that would have been created that no one's well i know they've
[2:02:10.720 --> 2:02:14.480]  tried to hire a bunch of social justice warrior police but when i'm been to the uk a lot of the
[2:02:14.480 --> 2:02:18.400]  police are listeners the word i'm getting is the police are going to start doing stuff vigilante
[2:02:19.280 --> 2:02:24.240]  no yeah and again before because i i complained about what the police have done to me a lot
[2:02:24.240 --> 2:02:28.880]  look that's not the police that's the hierarchy of the police that's political policing individual
[2:02:28.880 --> 2:02:33.760]  police officers that i meet even the the officer that was killed last in the most recent one run
[2:02:33.760 --> 2:02:38.720]  at them yeah so if you look at how the police reacted how the reacted to the Manchester investigation
[2:02:38.720 --> 2:02:42.640]  great okay i don't have a bad word to say about your individual police officers on the ground
[2:02:42.640 --> 2:02:47.360]  because i have so many of them complaining to me every time i see them about what what they have
[2:02:47.360 --> 2:02:52.880]  they we cannot cope with this i have a lead officer in one city saying we're not prepared for
[2:02:52.880 --> 2:02:57.120]  what's going to happen and we know it's coming we know it's coming well the police are just going
[2:02:57.120 --> 2:03:02.080]  to have to stand down and people take the matters in their own hands unfortunately that's what i see
[2:03:02.080 --> 2:03:06.720]  happening you know after the london riots when the london when london was burning on the third day
[2:03:06.720 --> 2:03:12.960]  the police failing to deal with it you had 2000 english english men who were football hooligans like
[2:03:12.960 --> 2:03:20.400]  this millwall man 200 2000 english men who come out to fight and they at least thank god for hooligans
[2:03:20.400 --> 2:03:25.920]  we ought to have a t-shirt i mean why is it only hooligans that are you like to go watch a soccer
[2:03:25.920 --> 2:03:31.840]  and fight at least they're still men they're men that aren't afraid to fight so they're men that
[2:03:31.840 --> 2:03:35.760]  aren't afraid to fight and unfortunately what what we've done in this generation what we've
[2:03:35.760 --> 2:03:41.040]  done in britain is we've really pacified our men and we've really created a weak generation of men
[2:03:41.040 --> 2:03:44.880]  and until we don't know how you sit there while people are stabbing women in front of you and
[2:03:44.880 --> 2:03:49.120]  don't do anything i mean i would it's so obvious pick up chairs beat them over the head attack them
[2:03:49.120 --> 2:03:53.600]  grab a fire extinguisher off the wall bash their brains out i mean it's so easy it's so easy to kill
[2:03:53.600 --> 2:03:57.360]  people i watch these muslims they're so pathetic we're trying to kill someone it's like a it's like
[2:03:57.360 --> 2:04:02.720]  they're like a 14 year old boy i had to be so i mean it's a they're a joke so i'm saying well that
[2:04:02.720 --> 2:04:08.880]  that's the problem and the men and for years we i've been condemned for years the english defense
[2:04:08.880 --> 2:04:12.080]  league was condemned but the men that will be fighting on the front line of that battle will
[2:04:12.080 --> 2:04:20.720]  be those men and when that battle comes because it's coming well and i know this the you guys
[2:04:20.720 --> 2:04:24.560]  aren't going to be targeting women and children it's going to be the known islamists is correct
[2:04:26.320 --> 2:04:30.720]  it's like i don't want to i don't want to ever see that i don't ever want to get to that situation
[2:04:30.720 --> 2:04:35.520]  when i say these things i'm not encouraging or supporting or saying that's why you're trying to
[2:04:35.520 --> 2:04:41.760]  stop it from happening i'm warning i'm warning and the government is creating a guaranteed vacuum
[2:04:41.760 --> 2:04:47.520]  like a chemistry experiment that will explode they are they are they're the ones allowing this
[2:04:47.520 --> 2:04:52.320]  they're the ones bringing it in they're the ones covering up for it and so is msm all right uh the
[2:04:52.320 --> 2:04:57.760]  rebel dot media tommy robbins thank you so much sir thank you alex thank you that's a real journalist
[2:04:57.760 --> 2:05:04.640]  and a real patriot a real hero we'll be back you might think the best ways to stop terrorism is
[2:05:04.640 --> 2:05:09.200]  maybe extreme vetting not allowing unvetted refugees into your home maybe not trying to
[2:05:09.200 --> 2:05:14.000]  do so many regime changes in middle eastern countries but you're all wrong in fact hillary
[2:05:14.000 --> 2:05:18.800]  clinton says the way to stop terrorism is to understand other cultures and their food yes
[2:05:18.800 --> 2:05:23.440]  really she also defended london mayor city con the man who once represented 911 al-qaeda member
[2:05:23.440 --> 2:05:28.320]  zacharias missouri called moderate muslim's uncle tom's and said terrorism was part and parcel to
[2:05:28.320 --> 2:05:33.200]  living in a major city and she added con has shown steady determined leadership hillary said the best
[2:05:33.200 --> 2:05:37.040]  way to combatting terror is to reach out to the world in order to understand people living in foreign
[2:05:37.040 --> 2:05:41.200]  countries getting to know one another learning about the experiences the lives the cultures the
[2:05:41.200 --> 2:05:45.520]  religions the food so does this mean we got to be like into stoning women cutting off their
[2:05:45.520 --> 2:05:49.840]  genitals and throwing gaze off buildings this is not a time to lash out to incite fear to use tragedy
[2:05:49.840 --> 2:05:53.680]  and terror for political gain said clinton a comment obviously aimed at donald trump and
[2:05:53.680 --> 2:05:57.360]  anyone else was correctly identified political correctness and tolerance of islam as creating
[2:05:57.360 --> 2:06:00.960]  a fertile ground for cherished attacks in the western world rob your reporting for info wars

[2:08:52.800 --> 2:08:57.280]  month of ramadan but none of it has anything to do with islam and i want to explain i'm not just
[2:08:57.280 --> 2:09:02.080]  you're harping on islam all day it's our government's bringing it in and admitting it's a class of
[2:09:02.080 --> 2:09:10.480]  civilizations so they can then take our free society away and you don't blame the cops you blame
[2:09:10.480 --> 2:09:14.480]  the congress you blame the governments you blame the presidents you blame the prime ministers
[2:09:14.480 --> 2:09:19.600]  that you blame the un you you you blame the globalists that are doing this and you stop them
[2:09:19.600 --> 2:09:25.360]  and trump has it under the law to be able to stop seven countries that have failed passport systems
[2:09:25.360 --> 2:09:35.200]  like libya that our own previous government destroyed and like samalia which everybody knows
[2:09:35.200 --> 2:09:41.600]  is a total failed state hellhole beyond hellholes our own military won't go there it's the most
[2:09:41.600 --> 2:09:47.520]  dangerous place on earth it's not like certain areas of mexico are dangerous and others aren't
[2:09:47.520 --> 2:09:57.040]  or north korea is all authoritarian all all of samalia is a veritable slave pit a hellhole
[2:09:58.240 --> 2:10:02.720]  beyond anything else on earth and they don't have working passport systems
[2:10:03.280 --> 2:10:07.680]  their airports aren't even properly working and people are coming from there with these little
[2:10:07.680 --> 2:10:13.600]  pieces of paper issued by their mosque and are led into the country because the un vets them because
[2:10:13.600 --> 2:10:19.760]  george soros and and and you know all these guys that are on the board they vet them so ben garrison
[2:10:19.760 --> 2:10:28.160]  has been exposing that has been exposing the swamp he is the political cartoonist of this era
[2:10:28.720 --> 2:10:32.720]  hands down there's some other great ones out there that we post on info wars dot com daily
[2:10:34.640 --> 2:10:40.640]  but it's simply amazing he's got a new book that he self-published it's amazing it's like a copy
[2:10:40.640 --> 2:10:48.080]  table book the 2016 presidential election collection it is absolutely a must-see especially for teenagers
[2:10:48.080 --> 2:10:53.840]  especially for kids this is the best way these kids are in a comic books this is the best i mean
[2:10:53.840 --> 2:10:57.760]  it's just amazing it's good for adults it's good for children it's good for everybody but this is
[2:10:57.760 --> 2:11:03.760]  how you wake somebody up usually people that are leftist or globalist minions they won't watch a film
[2:11:03.760 --> 2:11:08.880]  they won't even read a long book this is the weapon and when i saw this a few months ago i said get it
[2:11:08.880 --> 2:11:15.040]  carry it info wars store dot com or triple a two five three three one three nine i'll tell you what's
[2:11:15.040 --> 2:11:21.680]  great about this too no reviews yet it just went up and it's a big you know color print glossy book
[2:11:23.600 --> 2:11:26.480]  and you're supporting an independent publisher and it costs him a lot more to publish it so you're
[2:11:26.480 --> 2:11:30.560]  doing a great job when you order helping support him and everything they've tried to shut him down
[2:11:30.560 --> 2:11:34.240]  they've tried to block him in the newspapers he's been in newspapers for decades all over the country
[2:11:34.240 --> 2:11:39.680]  mainstream media kicks people like him out of their system uh entity frida's does some of the top
[2:11:39.680 --> 2:11:44.160]  magazines of the country they they try to threaten him and others uh you know when they are just
[2:11:44.160 --> 2:11:50.000]  libertarian not even even you know pro trump just like this is crazy the left-wing ban whites on
[2:11:50.000 --> 2:11:54.400]  campuses and just all this racism and all this division and hillary and you know robbing the
[2:11:54.400 --> 2:11:58.720]  money from the Haitians and running child kidnapping ranks i mean this is all out and ben garrison
[2:11:58.720 --> 2:12:07.040]  exposes it graphics dot com g r r graphics dot com and so here is the new book the 2016 presidential
[2:12:07.040 --> 2:12:12.160]  election much of his art festoons and decorates the halls here at the info wars news center in
[2:12:12.160 --> 2:12:15.760]  austin texas i want to work with him i never have time to talk to him probably i should do this
[2:12:15.760 --> 2:12:20.160]  about carrying his posters everything another outpost of his great materials at info wars
[2:12:20.160 --> 2:12:25.040]  store dot com but we're starting off with the book everybody needs to get it info wars store
[2:12:25.040 --> 2:12:31.040]  dot com but ben wow what a crazy time to be alive this is just this is getting crazier and crazier
[2:12:31.040 --> 2:12:35.840]  you knew your new big bad wolf uh illustrations one of the best i've ever seen showing the little
[2:12:35.840 --> 2:12:41.520]  sheep of europe uh saying we're not wolfophobic uh running into the mouth of islam
[2:12:43.920 --> 2:12:50.080]  yeah i drew that one yesterday and um i i almost did not put the word radical on there but i said
[2:12:50.080 --> 2:12:55.920]  it well i'll put radical but very very small because islam in and of itself is a radical
[2:12:55.920 --> 2:13:02.000]  religion in my my opinion it's a religion of force not peace and we should be able to criticize
[2:13:02.000 --> 2:13:07.680]  um muhammad i mean look at the guy killed what a thousand jews in medina and he had slaves and he
[2:13:07.680 --> 2:13:13.920]  had a half dozen wives and he practiced barbarity uh compare him to jesus i mean there's no comparison
[2:13:13.920 --> 2:13:19.520]  jesus was resurrected muhammad was not so i'm going to start speaking out against it because i don't
[2:13:19.520 --> 2:13:26.720]  think uh these so-called peaceful muslims are doing enough to stop what's going on um by themselves
[2:13:26.720 --> 2:13:31.440]  and they're in the best positions to do it and i heard your last guess and i was thinking to myself
[2:13:31.440 --> 2:13:36.320]  a lot of this problem would be solved if uh the men are allowed to have a concealed carry can you
[2:13:36.320 --> 2:13:41.840]  imagine can you imagine in the uk and even three of the guys out of 50 men and 50 women they asked
[2:13:41.840 --> 2:13:48.080]  me it was it was a pub full of people and income three scumbags with knives and they go right to
[2:13:48.080 --> 2:13:54.640]  women because they just hate women so much and then men stand there and one guy charges in and
[2:13:54.640 --> 2:13:58.720]  blocks them and probably save 10 lives in the eight minutes it took the cops to get there
[2:13:58.720 --> 2:14:05.840]  one guy fought them for they say most of the time well that certainly wouldn't happen in montana
[2:14:05.840 --> 2:14:10.320]  they'd you know all the men would get up and start bull rushing those people i was about to say i
[2:14:10.320 --> 2:14:14.160]  don't want to montan people think people are tough in texas texas is you know what it is that most
[2:14:14.160 --> 2:14:18.320]  people aren't from here you don't mess with people are nice in montana but you look at somebody
[2:14:18.320 --> 2:14:23.040]  wrong you're going to be in a fistfight or a knife fight in two seconds well i lived in texas for 10
[2:14:23.040 --> 2:14:29.840]  years now montana is like texas the only a much colder version but i'm saying it's mainly montanans
[2:14:29.840 --> 2:14:35.600]  that are still there yes exactly although there are some uh liberal hotbeds such as mazula and they
[2:14:35.600 --> 2:14:41.440]  want to bring in like 10 000 muslim refugees you know and so there are a lot of people here in
[2:14:41.440 --> 2:14:46.800]  montana myself included are trying to speak out against that lord no reason for that what would
[2:14:46.800 --> 2:14:54.720]  happen in a montana bar if three jihadis came in with butcher knives what's that but if three jihadis
[2:14:54.720 --> 2:15:03.680]  ran into a montana bar what would happen well they'd probably be shot down we wouldn't we wouldn't
[2:15:03.680 --> 2:15:12.400]  stand for that kind of gulf no it just it wouldn't happen alex not here and if it does well it'll be
[2:15:12.400 --> 2:15:18.080]  in the news and you'll see some dead jihadis it's true i know a lot of friends that uh have been
[2:15:18.080 --> 2:15:22.720]  up in montana and stuff and um and in texas that have moved there and they they've they've just said
[2:15:22.720 --> 2:15:27.520]  they said man a lot of nice folks up there but it's kind of got that mining thing left over from the
[2:15:27.520 --> 2:15:33.840]  wall all west and it's like it montana is nice but it's not cute it's i mean it's a little on the
[2:15:33.840 --> 2:15:40.480]  super aggressive side but that's another cultural side issue because montana is more like i'm an
[2:15:40.480 --> 2:15:46.640]  old guy alex and montana is more like what america used to be what i remembered used to be
[2:15:46.640 --> 2:15:51.120]  you're not being pulled over by cops everywhere you go there's no ticket red light ticket cameras
[2:15:51.120 --> 2:15:56.320]  sending you tickets in the mail the freedom here is is real and it's more palpable than
[2:15:56.320 --> 2:16:00.560]  say someplace like uh seattle and everybody respects everybody else everybody looks at
[2:16:00.560 --> 2:16:06.080]  everybody like it's an old western because it is to each other they're friendly you know unless
[2:16:06.080 --> 2:16:10.400]  you cross them but you know that's a good thing you know it's like the old south they're they're
[2:16:10.400 --> 2:16:15.200]  all nice and polite down there why because if you insult some southerner there could be a there
[2:16:15.200 --> 2:16:20.400]  could have been a duel in the past or there's going to be some kind of violent um you know
[2:16:20.400 --> 2:16:24.400]  confrontation so people are more polite and that's a good thing you don't want to go out and start
[2:16:24.400 --> 2:16:29.520]  insulting people because you don't know what you're going to get and that's the same way it is here
[2:16:29.520 --> 2:16:34.320]  in montana that's right you know i i was against the iraq war i know you were as well because that
[2:16:34.320 --> 2:16:38.880]  was a non-radical country that was being blamed for saudi arabia's behavior and and now we're
[2:16:38.880 --> 2:16:44.080]  toppling the regimes that let jews and christians live in peace and putting radicals in why do you
[2:16:44.080 --> 2:16:48.800]  think obama and soros and all them are behind it ben garrison again the legendary and i'm not just
[2:16:48.800 --> 2:16:54.000]  saying this he is the top cartoonist in the world just from page views and google searches it's
[2:16:54.000 --> 2:16:59.520]  hands down you were already probably in the top two or three but in the trump era you are numero uno
[2:17:00.800 --> 2:17:06.720]  and it all happened it really turned around in 2016 because of the election and my wife and i sat
[2:17:06.720 --> 2:17:12.560]  down in in the late 2015 and decided you know what i'm going to draw more cartoons this is too
[2:17:12.560 --> 2:17:19.920]  important and we're going to go all out this year and we saw our support snowball exponentially
[2:17:19.920 --> 2:17:24.480]  i remember you were on in 2015 they were boycotting you you were losing your big corporate deals
[2:17:24.480 --> 2:17:29.040]  and you came on we had a five interview and you said me and my wife decided to double down and now
[2:17:29.040 --> 2:17:34.160]  you are superstar yeah well i don't know about that but we have seen success we sold a lot of
[2:17:34.160 --> 2:17:38.480]  books a lot of signed books we sell a lot of print no i understand monetarily but i mean when it
[2:17:38.480 --> 2:17:42.800]  comes to changing the world bro you're like the voice you're as big as info wars you're as big as
[2:17:42.800 --> 2:17:48.000]  drudge now there's not there's not much out there as big as this you are now one of the main guns
[2:17:48.000 --> 2:17:52.480]  brother you are one of the main things defending this country and there are plenty of room for
[2:17:52.480 --> 2:17:58.400]  more guns i always encourage young cartoonists to join the fray and a lot of them are afraid
[2:17:58.400 --> 2:18:01.440]  because they don't want to lose their job they don't want to lose their you know they don't want
[2:18:01.440 --> 2:18:06.880]  to get trolled and and unfortunately that's kind of the crucible that you're going to get hammered
[2:18:06.880 --> 2:18:13.120]  with when you start out however this is this is just too important and what well what my cartoons
[2:18:13.120 --> 2:18:19.920]  are alex i consider them um visual alarm bells now you get on your show and you get angry and you
[2:18:19.920 --> 2:18:27.920]  rant my cartoons are a form of a visual rant but it's their visual alarm bells and when yet alarm
[2:18:27.920 --> 2:18:33.520]  bell goes off and they get heard it's going to make some people angry why did you turn that damn
[2:18:33.520 --> 2:18:38.000]  thing off and other people are happy well you're you're doing a great service so you're waking
[2:18:38.000 --> 2:18:44.720]  us up to the what's going on so i hear very positive things and i hear very negative things
[2:18:44.720 --> 2:18:50.560]  but that's good that's a mark of a good i gotta say it then the way you control women happy i was
[2:18:50.560 --> 2:18:56.400]  just i was just looking at that uh these scales of justice uh with with the goddess of justice
[2:18:56.400 --> 2:19:00.800]  there i mean that i would love i wish you were a sculptor i'd love to have a sculptor of that
[2:19:00.800 --> 2:19:07.040]  woman in my house well that cartoon uses a basic cartoon principle called contrast
[2:19:07.040 --> 2:19:12.640]  so you see the contrast between hillary and her giant platter of corruption and then the non russian
[2:19:12.640 --> 2:19:17.840]  and we're seeing right now with this latest uh what's her name reality winner what a name well
[2:19:18.720 --> 2:19:24.640]  it might be a tiny flame alex but you're going to see the deep state left start fanning that little

[2:25:09.360 --> 2:25:16.480]  new book at m4store.com or graphics grr graphics.com ben garrison uh then i saw you shake your head
[2:25:16.480 --> 2:25:21.200]  because people couldn't see you then we gone to break when i said the legend i mean i see your
[2:25:21.200 --> 2:25:26.160]  stuff more than any other memes ever together and it's it was already like that two years ago
[2:25:26.160 --> 2:25:34.080]  it's exponential and it's so all so hard-hitting uh there's some other great guys as well what's
[2:25:34.080 --> 2:25:40.800]  brocco or grocker what's his name the other guy that's pretty good brocco or some oh brocco
[2:25:40.800 --> 2:25:45.440]  yeah brocco he's a very prolific cartoonist i mean he really knocks him out and by the way
[2:25:45.440 --> 2:25:49.760]  i didn't mean that in disrespect i'm teleprompter free i was just going out of memory uh tell us
[2:25:49.760 --> 2:25:55.280]  who he is bro and there's another one that glenn mccoy is really good but you know a conservative
[2:25:55.280 --> 2:25:59.760]  cartoonists are very few and far between the vast majority of cartoonists working in the mainstream
[2:25:59.760 --> 2:26:06.640]  media are are liberals they consider themselves centrist but no what they're drawing is far left
[2:26:06.640 --> 2:26:11.920]  uh they're anti-gun they're they're pro big government they always want more taxes as a solution
[2:26:11.920 --> 2:26:16.320]  but i see more of your cartoons in cyberspace than all of theirs combined it just shows no
[2:26:16.880 --> 2:26:23.760]  this is a new paradigm alex the social media is the dinosaur media is dying and i know i
[2:26:23.760 --> 2:26:28.800]  released a cartoon a couple months ago and it had like 500 000 views on facebook or something like that
[2:26:28.800 --> 2:26:33.440]  and i'm saying well that's more than a major metro who needs newspapers anymore and young people are
[2:26:33.440 --> 2:26:39.760]  not reading newspapers or watching mainstream tv and they know it and they're desperate to try to
[2:26:40.400 --> 2:26:46.720]  get their their fat thumbs on the internet and try to slow us down but this is a new uh this is a new
[2:26:48.000 --> 2:26:54.400]  means for any cartoonist out there to uh to to circumvent the uh publishers who would not
[2:26:54.400 --> 2:26:59.920]  publish my book or the mainstream media would not publish my cartoons but there's a way to get seen
[2:27:00.560 --> 2:27:05.520]  and i've been successful like i said we started out in 2016 with like 2 000 twitter followers
[2:27:05.520 --> 2:27:12.080]  we're up to like 80 000 now i mean and a lot of that of course i mean i have to um i'm married to
[2:27:12.080 --> 2:27:18.000]  a great woman and tina who's worked very hard to make gir-graphic success she works on the website
[2:27:18.000 --> 2:27:22.320]  she does social media she handles the prince and mailing and i couldn't have done it without her
[2:27:22.320 --> 2:27:27.920]  but so i'm really lucky to have a woman like her to make this absolutely well look that's why this
[2:27:27.920 --> 2:27:33.680]  is so important it's an information war and whereas you don't make a ton of money you're doing well
[2:27:33.680 --> 2:27:37.600]  and you're reaching the world and isn't that the incredible satisfaction if you're talking about one
[2:27:37.600 --> 2:27:43.200]  of your cartoons 500 000 actual you know readers you can confirm on one page but then you were
[2:27:43.200 --> 2:27:48.240]  duplicated on millions of pages we've got the algorithms we've got the numbers we can look
[2:27:48.240 --> 2:27:54.000]  uh and just and just what we post of your stuff and you know a cartoon that doesn't get a lot of
[2:27:54.000 --> 2:28:01.120]  traffic gets 100 000 readers 15 000 shares and then once it's shared we can't track it anymore so i
[2:28:01.120 --> 2:28:05.680]  mean it's crazy some of your stuff on our site gets out like you said a half million a million
[2:28:05.680 --> 2:28:10.880]  times that's just one site and you're everywhere that's changing the world and it shows what just
[2:28:10.880 --> 2:28:16.880]  a few people working together can do and it shows can we even name the so-called liberal
[2:28:16.880 --> 2:28:23.040]  cartoonist does anyone even know who they are no no they because no one wants to be force fed this
[2:28:23.040 --> 2:28:30.160]  garbage anymore that's right that's one of the reasons i've you know it's like the the left
[2:28:30.160 --> 2:28:34.160]  says there's no such thing as a conservative cartoonist because you're not funny and and
[2:28:34.160 --> 2:28:39.280]  your status quo wrong the status quo is now the liberal deep state the globalist deep state the
[2:28:39.280 --> 2:28:44.400]  collectivist deep state and so that's how come i've gotten so so much attention and traction
[2:28:44.400 --> 2:28:49.040]  because because it's like uh well finally somebody is uh coming out and drawing the
[2:28:49.040 --> 2:28:52.960]  cartoons that the mainstream media won't won't allow to be seen that's a paradigm i've explained
[2:28:52.960 --> 2:28:59.680]  to media when rand paul's being hardcore and he won that upset senate election politico say how'd he
[2:28:59.680 --> 2:29:03.680]  win and why are you such a big part of it and i said because he was seen as an outsider in his
[2:29:03.680 --> 2:29:07.600]  one if he becomes an establishment he'll destroy himself i said if you want to destroy rand paul
[2:29:07.600 --> 2:29:14.560]  politico endorse him and they actually had that quote but they just don't get it they're a joke
[2:29:14.560 --> 2:29:20.080]  and and since everybody sold out those of us that don't sell out actually win in the end
[2:29:20.080 --> 2:29:24.400]  even though we didn't do it to be maxia valiant it turned out that way i mean info wars i'm not
[2:29:24.400 --> 2:29:28.480]  gonna even get into the numbers it sounds like we're bragging it's insane okay even post-election
[2:29:28.480 --> 2:29:32.800]  because you know that was the peak 80 something million in one week confirmed not hits impressions
[2:29:32.800 --> 2:29:37.280]  listeners real stuff and then it was you know our old plateau was 30 something million our new
[2:29:37.280 --> 2:29:42.160]  plateau is almost 50 million a week i mean how do they compete with 50 million people a week
[2:29:42.160 --> 2:29:47.520]  conservatively just on our platforms we can confirm stay right there because i'm let me tell
[2:29:47.520 --> 2:29:53.440]  you something nobody knows but i can tell you i can tell you right now 100 million people see
[2:29:53.440 --> 2:30:03.920]  his work a week ben garrison like jones and the gcn radio network you might think the best ways to
[2:30:03.920 --> 2:30:09.280]  stop terrorism is maybe extreme vetting not allowing unvetted refugees into your home maybe not trying
[2:30:09.280 --> 2:30:14.160]  to do so many regime changes in middle eastern countries love you're all wrong in fact hillary
[2:30:14.160 --> 2:30:19.520]  clinton says a way to stop terrorism is to understand other cultures and their food yes really she
[2:30:19.520 --> 2:30:24.160]  also defended london mayor city con the man who once represented 911 al-qaeda member zacharias
[2:30:24.160 --> 2:30:29.120]  missouri called moderate muslim's uncle tom's and said terrorism was part and parcel to living in a
[2:30:29.120 --> 2:30:33.600]  major city and she added con has shown steady determined leadership hillary said the best way
[2:30:33.600 --> 2:30:37.280]  to combating terror is to reach out to the world in order to understand people living in foreign
[2:30:37.280 --> 2:30:41.440]  countries getting to know one another learning about the experiences the lives the cultures the
[2:30:41.440 --> 2:30:46.080]  religions the food so does this mean we got to be like into stoning women cutting off their genitals
[2:30:46.080 --> 2:30:50.160]  and throwing gays off buildings this is not a time to lash out to incite fear to use tragedy and
[2:30:50.160 --> 2:30:54.320]  terror for political gain said clinton a comment obviously aimed at donald trump and anyone else
[2:30:54.320 --> 2:30:58.080]  was correctly identified political correctness and tolerance of islam as creating a fertile ground
[2:30:58.080 --> 2:31:02.400]  for terrorist attacks in the western world robert reporting for info wars nightly news and info wars

[2:37:54.960 --> 2:37:59.680]  the Federal Reserve's private now they know there's a world government uh they all this stuff that MSM
[2:37:59.680 --> 2:38:04.400]  tried to suppress they have failed Bilderberg it's out in the open where do you see all this going
[2:38:04.400 --> 2:38:10.880]  or what are other key points well you're right i mean all these things that used to be called
[2:38:10.880 --> 2:38:18.560]  conspiracy theories have now been revealed to be flat out conspiracies and so i say um what
[2:38:18.560 --> 2:38:25.040]  trump has done and i consider him not necessarily a democrat or republican but a populist president
[2:38:25.600 --> 2:38:31.600]  populist president like Andrew Jackson and what trump has done is really he's beaten the snakes
[2:38:31.600 --> 2:38:37.200]  out of their holes so now we see him for what they what they are and that that in and of itself is
[2:38:37.200 --> 2:38:43.360]  quite quite a good accomplishment more people are waking up and you know your show and my cartoons
[2:38:43.360 --> 2:38:48.880]  we're just trying to to continue that momentum and people are realizing you know hey the constant we
[2:38:48.880 --> 2:38:55.440]  have something called a constitution the constitution has given us unalienable rights it's actually
[2:38:55.440 --> 2:39:04.160]  unalienable rights but in actuality we all have a lien on us due to our our um immoral system of
[2:39:04.160 --> 2:39:08.960]  money so we have a lien on us and we're living in an illusion of freedom but in reality we're
[2:39:08.960 --> 2:39:16.000]  owned and we're kind of like um drifting more and more toward this uh the police state and um the
[2:39:16.000 --> 2:39:22.720]  prison planet as you call it so we have to really wake up and not just go with our like in my cartoon
[2:39:22.720 --> 2:39:30.160]  shows these smiling lambs going brainwashed into the great maw great maw of globalism and they're
[2:39:30.160 --> 2:39:39.520]  using islam as a tool to uh expedite that there is something inherently scummy in the eyes of
[2:39:39.520 --> 2:39:46.880]  islamists so i don't care if they're white black hispanic uh i mean you name it it's just so trashy
[2:39:46.880 --> 2:39:52.160]  it's it's a prison culture they recruit out of the prisons and i mean the women are just scared
[2:39:52.160 --> 2:39:56.640]  to death when you see uh you know orthodox islamic women out in public with their husbands or their
[2:39:56.640 --> 2:40:02.160]  sons they're bowing down so there's this paradox of these spoiled rotten western women allied with it
[2:40:02.160 --> 2:40:08.640]  in some type of sick Stockholm syndrome complaining about the western man that literally has put
[2:40:08.640 --> 2:40:13.840]  women on a pedestal i mean it is it is the most upside down abomination what do you make of that
[2:40:15.120 --> 2:40:18.960]  well it's to me it's not a religion of peace it's a religion of hate and force
[2:40:18.960 --> 2:40:28.480]  and compare that to uh um jesus who pretty preached love and forgiveness you know islam
[2:40:28.480 --> 2:40:35.440]  preaches domination and revenge and so i mean we just have to start calling it for what it is
[2:40:35.440 --> 2:40:42.640]  and what the major disconnect i see is why are these feminists all pro islam i do not understand
[2:40:42.640 --> 2:40:48.640]  that at all they should be out there with their hats on for protesting islam and let's be clear
[2:40:48.640 --> 2:40:52.320]  because we followed this i sort of noticed in six seven eight years ago that feminism kept
[2:40:52.320 --> 2:40:56.160]  defending it lord stymie kept defending it and then we talked about they said oh that's crazy
[2:40:56.160 --> 2:41:00.880]  feminists don't defend islam and then now they have soros funded deals in germany and in uh
[2:41:00.880 --> 2:41:05.600]  berlin and dc i've been there uh and my crews have been there where they hand out thousands of
[2:41:05.600 --> 2:41:10.720]  ajibs the main sponsors and then us today and everybody comes out in just hundreds i see articles
[2:41:10.720 --> 2:41:17.440]  every day wear a ajib go to a mosque learn to be a muslim it's liberal uh you know muslims are the
[2:41:17.440 --> 2:41:25.360]  true feminists huffington post i mean what what what what and then us today wear the ajib to fight
[2:41:25.360 --> 2:41:32.960]  trump what type of fruit cake bs is this it's if you look at a map of europe and you see
[2:41:34.160 --> 2:41:39.200]  two countries that aren't mass importing islam into their countries one is poland the other one is
[2:41:39.200 --> 2:41:44.800]  hungry and you see that there are no terrorist attacks there what does that tell you and of course
[2:41:44.800 --> 2:41:50.080]  soros is very angry at countries like uh hungry because they're not going along with the program
[2:41:50.080 --> 2:41:54.800]  we need more of this countries in europe you know i think england is starting to wake up
[2:41:54.800 --> 2:41:59.840]  because they you know they voted for brexit and i hear i that's why they're getting hit now well
[2:41:59.840 --> 2:42:05.120]  with them that's exactly what i was going to say alex and that that's why you're seeing so much of
[2:42:05.120 --> 2:42:14.720]  that um the pushback there by islam in londonistan so um it's like um we have to we have to see people
[2:42:14.720 --> 2:42:20.160]  like uh geert wilders and we have to support people like marina marina lepan and let's remember
[2:42:20.160 --> 2:42:23.840]  once that we're just a few years down the road with us they start killing people trying to kill
[2:42:23.840 --> 2:42:29.040]  kirk wilders killing other politicians that speak the truth i mean this is vicious this is dangerous
[2:42:29.040 --> 2:42:33.760]  this is bullying and when we were invading the middle east and doing stuff to them i was against
[2:42:33.760 --> 2:42:37.920]  it because that's bullying plus we were getting rid of the good guys quite frankly and yes saddam
[2:42:37.920 --> 2:42:42.400]  and and others are good guys compared to to to what we're facing why do you think and then we're
[2:42:42.400 --> 2:42:49.520]  going to call western governments are backing radical islam um ben garrison the western governments
[2:42:49.520 --> 2:42:55.920]  are no longer um answerable to the people they're answerable to um you know the illuminati at the
[2:42:55.920 --> 2:43:01.120]  top which want to control people and they want to get you know it's like this relentless push you
[2:43:01.120 --> 2:43:05.920]  see it you know they they're never going to give up their agenda 21 and their goals to achieve
[2:43:05.920 --> 2:43:12.160]  um global government or global governance is al gaur would call it but it's always the same
[2:43:12.880 --> 2:43:19.200]  means to an end and they're using the importation as islam to break down western civilization it
[2:43:19.200 --> 2:43:25.120]  goes basically against the magna carta and common law and when you get sharia law is just it's
[2:43:25.120 --> 2:43:31.200]  completely incompatible with western civilization and our laws and our constitution and they're
[2:43:31.200 --> 2:43:34.480]  not going to give sharia law because it's part of their career and it tells them they have to
[2:43:34.480 --> 2:43:39.280]  implement that so what can be done well what can be done is they the muslims need a mass
[2:43:39.280 --> 2:43:46.240]  reformation or something to renounce some of these um radical ideas i agree but i think we're seeing
[2:43:46.240 --> 2:43:53.360]  the reformation i think al qaeda is the reformation i i mean if that's what al qaeda says no this is
[2:43:53.360 --> 2:44:00.400]  the reformation we're getting back to our roots exactly well that's you know the roots of oris
[2:44:00.400 --> 2:44:07.200]  have always um been pretty radical haven't they that's how they they are able to conquer i mean
[2:44:07.200 --> 2:44:11.200]  you know sharia used to be a christian country now it's muslim look at look what they're doing
[2:44:11.200 --> 2:44:16.640]  the two all the the turkey used to be christian yes well look what they're doing to the koptic
[2:44:16.640 --> 2:44:21.920]  christians in egypt they're still wiping them out it's still it's a war on christianity and it's a
[2:44:21.920 --> 2:44:26.240]  war on western civilization and then truss criticized for saying that they've doubled the
[2:44:26.240 --> 2:44:30.720]  amount of christians killed the last decade it's exponential more than half of all religious
[2:44:30.720 --> 2:44:35.680]  persecuted people are christians it's exploding and islams about to double the three billion people
[2:44:35.680 --> 2:44:40.800]  from 1.4 ladies and gentlemen we have to deal with this and i don't want a class of civilizations i
[2:44:40.800 --> 2:44:45.680]  don't want a police state to counter it no no i want it dealt with and i want people that espouse
[2:44:45.680 --> 2:44:50.240]  they're with isis and espouse they think women are toilet paper they have no right to come here
[2:44:50.240 --> 2:44:55.600]  period and i don't think trump's gone far enough ben garrison's our guest let's go to phone calls here
[2:44:55.600 --> 2:45:00.720]  we're gonna go to dan dan rod keith christ and many others dan in florida you're on the year worldwide
[2:45:03.680 --> 2:45:08.640]  to talk to you alex um i just want to say thank you for all your fine products you have thank you
[2:45:08.640 --> 2:45:14.000]  if i had if i was rich i would buy a ton more products um you know i'm just a middle class brother
[2:45:14.000 --> 2:45:17.520]  just spread the links and take action and pray for us it doesn't matter god bless you go ahead
[2:45:17.520 --> 2:45:23.840]  what's your question well um not less of a question but more like a statement you know obviously
[2:45:23.840 --> 2:45:28.240]  the terror that's going on the attacks are going on everywhere you know you guys really
[2:45:28.240 --> 2:45:31.760]  you know got my attention when you're talking about you know they're targeting women and
[2:45:31.760 --> 2:45:37.200]  these fake liberals and all these things well you know obviously the third war you know must be
[2:45:37.200 --> 2:45:42.640]  fermented by taking advantage of the differences caused by the asian toward illuminati and you
[2:45:42.640 --> 2:45:48.240]  know the islamic world you know separates from the the nihilists you know the albert pike lays
[2:45:48.240 --> 2:45:53.040]  all best and there's no doubt the globalists want to play christianity off against islam
[2:45:53.040 --> 2:45:56.480]  have a big giant war and they've been saying this for a hundred years and then out of it
[2:45:56.480 --> 2:46:00.880]  bring this new this new religious system and that's what ben garrison was just saying they're
[2:46:00.880 --> 2:46:05.200]  using this clash to bring everybody down i don't want to kill muslims i don't want to see muslims
[2:46:05.200 --> 2:46:09.760]  die but i'm not going to have guys run around in nightgowns on welfare bitching and telling
[2:46:09.760 --> 2:46:15.280]  me that my family has to wear hoods over their heads exactly you know and this is all planned
[2:46:15.280 --> 2:46:20.560]  you know you you say this all the time and you know you're you're highly intelligent on this and
[2:46:20.560 --> 2:46:25.920]  you know it's their plan they want to bring them in here collapse us and take over again
[2:46:25.920 --> 2:46:33.600]  and use you know cause cyber war class war religious war exactly and then the media spends it
[2:46:33.600 --> 2:46:38.160]  and says that i say the cops are doing the bombings no the politicians are bringing in people
[2:46:38.160 --> 2:46:43.520]  from that are known isis and al-qaeda fighters i mean if somebody's on video killing people
[2:46:43.520 --> 2:46:48.000]  swearing allegiance to isis they should be when they go to the airport they should be met by the
[2:46:48.000 --> 2:46:53.760]  military that literally takes them you know back to the country they came from or takes them and
[2:46:53.760 --> 2:46:57.760]  tries them and then executes them and that's not a radical statement if we caught nazis
[2:46:57.760 --> 2:47:01.680]  that had been involved killing people in world war two try them and execute them i'm not a vicious
[2:47:01.680 --> 2:47:07.200]  person but you have to deal with these people god bless you i appreciate your call ben garrison
[2:47:07.200 --> 2:47:14.800]  you want to comment before we go to dan well yeah it's what he said is uh is right on i mean what
[2:47:14.800 --> 2:47:19.760]  what i don't want to i don't want a confrontation with them either and i don't hate muslims i you
[2:47:19.760 --> 2:47:27.600]  know what i don't know any muslims but i hate what is happening when we are forced to respect
[2:47:27.600 --> 2:47:34.640]  something we don't respect let's face it and i don't want to have to be forced to comply with
[2:47:36.560 --> 2:47:41.440]  the traditions and customs that muslims bring in or else get accused of hate speech and then
[2:47:41.440 --> 2:47:46.320]  locked up but i don't want to be clear america but it's happening in europe right now somebody
[2:47:46.320 --> 2:47:49.280]  speaks out against it well well you know you're going to lose your job you're going to get a
[2:47:49.280 --> 2:47:55.040]  big fine i have a friend in germany right now he's outraged by the constant influx of immigrants
[2:47:55.600 --> 2:48:01.600]  but he's reluctant to speak up too vociferously about it because they have hate speech laws and
[2:48:01.600 --> 2:48:05.920]  he doesn't want to see everybody has to violate those because they're unconstitutional so that
[2:48:05.920 --> 2:48:11.760]  it's ineffectual that's the key is people have to break with that uh i mean by the way folks
[2:48:11.760 --> 2:48:16.080]  i'm not going to get into it it it's just the muslims respect people that are aware of this
[2:48:16.640 --> 2:48:21.040]  especially the shiites i was invited to speak and have dinner with octman denigé didn't do it
[2:48:21.040 --> 2:48:25.680]  for obvious reasons i've been invited just currently to go meet with the itola the ruler of and i
[2:48:25.680 --> 2:48:30.400]  don't mean just go to an event i mean go meet with them so that's the kind of stuff goes on boy the
[2:48:30.400 --> 2:48:33.920]  media would have a heyday with that i've been divided some other countries to speak long before
[2:48:33.920 --> 2:48:39.120]  all these controversies i didn't go for exactly those reasons but let's just say this they respect
[2:48:39.120 --> 2:48:44.880]  us for saying this okay and it's not the other way around on the mainstream media though alex
[2:48:44.880 --> 2:48:48.880]  what the mainstream media what you're allowed to do there is basch christianity that could be
[2:48:48.880 --> 2:48:55.280]  laughed at humiliated but you cannot humiliate um or bash uh well that's right let's go to dan
[2:48:55.280 --> 2:49:03.760]  in indiana you're on the air dan alex yes sir alex give me a chance to speak my mind uh before
[2:49:03.760 --> 2:49:09.280]  you cut me off oh don't don't preface it just go start talking okay all right you got a big fan
[2:49:09.280 --> 2:49:15.280]  in akron ohio with christie wall land of plenty if you ever want to come and hang out but my
[2:49:15.280 --> 2:49:24.080]  topic is uh i for i i mentioned it the last time i was on the show and tommy rominson said there will
[2:49:24.080 --> 2:49:31.840]  be uh people on the street and he just confirmed what i was saying i i for i then roger stone did
[2:49:31.840 --> 2:49:38.400]  not answer my question who is jerry kushner is he a big satanist he's got a big six six six on his
[2:49:38.400 --> 2:49:47.280]  building uh i know satanist needs towers and that that location may be a magnet uh enter the well
[2:49:47.280 --> 2:49:50.960]  i'll say this i'm not going to say i'm not going to say we have no evidence kush there's a devil
[2:49:50.960 --> 2:49:55.600]  worshipper he's an orthodox jew and i don't think he's a bad guy i think he's influenced by democrats
[2:49:55.600 --> 2:50:00.400]  that was already a prime piece of real estate that came up for sale i think it's an unlucky number
[2:50:00.400 --> 2:50:07.360]  six six six but you know uh i mean the point is is that uh what's your question or statement about
[2:50:07.360 --> 2:50:18.240]  kushner it could be a portal to another demonic uh uh dimension uh that location because uh don't
[2:50:18.240 --> 2:50:23.040]  you find it kind of curious that roger fellow center is right across the street from there
[2:50:23.040 --> 2:50:29.920]  and there was a house sitting at the same site back in the day that used to have strange things
[2:50:29.920 --> 2:50:37.520]  going on so that is a portal that is like a magnet drawing negative energy and he may be just
[2:50:38.080 --> 2:50:43.440]  just uh a freak about the number six six six well you know the the the u n building was built on a
[2:50:43.440 --> 2:50:47.520]  giant slaughterhouse facility uh that was there so that's that's strange enough but i'm not saying
[2:50:47.520 --> 2:50:52.400]  anything happened there because one of my great great great great great great grandfather ancestors
[2:50:52.400 --> 2:50:56.960]  sold that land that the rogerfellers later bought that the u n building is on was just a bunch of
[2:50:56.960 --> 2:51:01.440]  swamp land he owned he was wealthy those david errors or william errors he came to texas started

[2:55:40.880 --> 2:55:46.240]  meghan i'm ready to be interviewed thank you okay thanks she's very nice because they had a bunch
[2:55:46.240 --> 2:55:50.880]  of newspapers saying she wasn't actually coming like i'd lie or something uh because we've done
[2:55:50.880 --> 2:55:55.760]  like three corrections in 20 years and then they say that that's fake news i'll do a correction
[2:55:55.760 --> 2:56:01.200]  uh let's now go back to uh ben garrison that's actually the drudge chair right there so if she
[2:56:01.200 --> 2:56:05.520]  wanted if we wanted to give her a microphone she'd actually co-host from the shadows and actually
[2:56:05.520 --> 2:56:12.000]  copy matt drudge i don't think meghan kelly can help it can can i can't afford you i know we
[2:56:12.000 --> 2:56:16.480]  hey we're of the people we don't have a lot of money around here we're just here no i'm serious
[2:56:16.480 --> 2:56:22.560]  we're just here in texas uh and you know we are just small time little guys here we're not the big
[2:56:22.560 --> 2:56:28.320]  mighty nbc uh seriously though uh we should handle her microphone should we handle her microphone
[2:56:28.320 --> 2:56:34.960]  on the remote just just in case she wants it okay i'm gonna stop uh ben garrison this is
[2:56:34.960 --> 2:56:40.080]  uh crazy stuff going on you heard the last caller let's just give her the politics of jaren kushner
[2:56:40.080 --> 2:56:44.480]  um i noticed he's kept his head down the last month or so since it became a big controversy
[2:56:44.480 --> 2:56:49.120]  that he might have actually seen a russian you have to even see a russian now and you know and
[2:56:49.120 --> 2:56:52.960]  you're in the trump administration you have to be burned at the stake i don't think kushner's that
[2:56:52.960 --> 2:56:59.920]  bad of a guy what do you think i've got mixed opinions about it i'm still waiting to see
[2:57:00.640 --> 2:57:07.120]  how it's going to unfold i've got some trepidations about his daughter having as much um much power
[2:57:07.120 --> 2:57:13.200]  as she does um but overall i mean i i'll criticize trump and i have drawn a person i drew a cartoon
[2:57:13.200 --> 2:57:17.840]  with a tug of war with ban on one side and kushner and nivanka and others on the other
[2:57:17.840 --> 2:57:25.760]  um battling for his ear so to speak and um i i just think we need a little bit more time i was
[2:57:25.760 --> 2:57:32.640]  i was very happy to see trump reject the climate change stuff that's to me was him slapping the
[2:57:32.640 --> 2:57:37.600]  climate change illuminati right in the face and i was really happy to see it as a good sign and i
[2:57:37.600 --> 2:57:44.240]  hope he can continue because again i see him as as a strong populist president similar to
[2:57:44.240 --> 2:57:49.280]  to andrew jackson and as you know it took him two turns to turn take down the central bankers
[2:57:49.840 --> 2:57:55.200]  and since then i mean the swamp has grown exponentially larger and deeper but if anybody
[2:57:55.200 --> 2:57:59.680]  can do it it's trump he's our last best hope so i'm going to continue supporting on my cartoons
[2:58:00.480 --> 2:58:03.840]  well ben garrison i wanted to get some more calls but we're out of time i'm going to
[2:58:03.840 --> 2:58:07.840]  do five more minutes and then punch out or so i can go to those calls but we've got your new

[2:58:22.880 --> 2:58:27.040]  sunscreen info or store.com because everything we sell is evil and bad we're not allowed to have

[3:00:38.320 --> 3:00:43.920]  know how much of that just got seen but uh just like i was chasing matt dredge around with a
[3:00:43.920 --> 3:00:47.680]  microphone but then i gave him the microphone he goes oh all right i'll do five minutes and it was an
[3:00:47.680 --> 3:00:54.320]  hour of mega mega hit tens of millions of extra views on youtube so that was fun do we have uh
[3:00:54.320 --> 3:01:00.560]  his botanic majesty joining us from uh from britany i guess he's over there in france right
[3:01:00.560 --> 3:01:06.000]  now paul watch and skype audio only in this hour more terror attacks in france terror attacks
[3:01:06.000 --> 3:01:12.720]  everywhere that have nothing to do with islam paul well that's right alex we're on ramadan
[3:01:12.720 --> 3:01:19.680]  bombathon stabathon whatever you want to call it day 11 59 attacks so far in that 11 day period
[3:01:19.680 --> 3:01:27.040]  627 dead uh after isis called for attacks during ramadan but of course it has nothing to do with
[3:01:27.040 --> 3:01:32.560]  islam and as he said we had another attack in paris today at the notredam cathedral which is
[3:01:32.560 --> 3:01:38.800]  normally surrounded by troops because islam is so peaceful and it was an Algerian student screaming
[3:01:38.800 --> 3:01:43.600]  this is for Syria so i guess they'll be debating whether it's uh political or whether it's
[3:01:43.600 --> 3:01:49.600]  terrorism for the next 48 hours he tried to attack a police officer hammers with other
[3:01:49.600 --> 3:01:54.560]  crude instruments he was shot he was injured so we're now at the point alex where it's not just
[3:01:55.440 --> 3:02:01.440]  plots it's not cells of individuals that are radicalized it's just students that just run
[3:02:01.440 --> 3:02:06.720]  around on a whim go absolutely insane with hammers and just strike out at anyone they can
[3:02:06.720 --> 3:02:13.440]  so that's the situation right now in france which is basically a dying country tell that people are
[3:02:13.440 --> 3:02:19.360]  just absolutely at the end of their wits about this it's it's the the the morale is in the toilet
[3:02:19.360 --> 3:02:24.000]  what about they've got jihadis that openly say they want to kill gays and and murder people
[3:02:24.000 --> 3:02:28.320]  you know on video to tommy robinson and then they put them in a lavish flat because i know
[3:02:28.320 --> 3:02:33.600]  how much stuff costs in london with police protection and police cameras and they're housing
[3:02:33.600 --> 3:02:38.720]  thousands of them for their own protection right next to an elementary school and the back fence in
[3:02:38.720 --> 3:02:46.640]  his backyard in his garden is is to the playground oh no i mean they're flaunting it now alex you
[3:02:46.640 --> 3:02:51.840]  saw the guy just there in the clip he was in the same channel for a documentary as one of the london
[3:02:51.840 --> 3:02:57.440]  bridge attackers basically laughing sardonically when they said well your views are exactly and
[3:02:57.440 --> 3:03:03.920]  he looks like a total now he looks like a total now i just can't believe us and they're in a
[3:03:03.920 --> 3:03:11.120]  documentary called the jihadis next door being jihadis police knew about them they say oh we
[3:03:11.120 --> 3:03:15.520]  don't know they were planning an attack this is the situation alex there's at least three under
[3:03:15.520 --> 3:03:22.960]  these people another 20 000 potential terrorists they take it takes dozens of cops to monitor them 24
[3:03:22.960 --> 3:03:29.600]  seven they can't do it we can't lock them up they're allowing them back in from syria from iraq to
[3:03:29.600 --> 3:03:35.360]  attack us the manchester bomber came back in from libya and it's just an absolute joke and what's
[3:03:35.360 --> 3:03:40.880]  crazy is thousands of them as the police have said won't even deny they fought for isis or al-qaeda
[3:03:40.880 --> 3:03:45.440]  won't it won't deny their families won't deny they want to kill people it's like okay you just said
[3:03:45.440 --> 3:03:50.160]  you want to kill people and you fought for isis we're going to euthanize you i mean you're admitting
[3:03:50.160 --> 3:03:57.040]  it just they need to be euthanized and instead they give them free housing and benefits and situate
[3:03:57.040 --> 3:04:01.440]  them one minute away from a school alex notice i said euthanized because these aren't people these
[3:04:01.440 --> 3:04:08.320]  are animals and you've got you have sadeeq khan today the islamist mayor of london who defended
[3:04:08.320 --> 3:04:13.600]  actual al-qaeda members in the past that said that moderate muslims are uncle tom's literally
[3:04:14.240 --> 3:04:18.640]  you know we're letting in terrorists from syria he's calling for trump to be banned
[3:04:18.640 --> 3:04:24.160]  this is the guy who you know demanded that lewis farrakhan who has described jews as bloodsuckers
[3:04:24.160 --> 3:04:30.720]  and called hitler a very great man he says that farrakhan should be allowed to enter the uk well
[3:04:30.720 --> 3:04:34.800]  i'll say this farrakhan has moderated to a great extent i just want to have peace and i think he
[3:04:34.800 --> 3:04:38.240]  could be the god he's trying to get us along to actually back down now but i know he did say some
[3:04:38.240 --> 3:04:43.040]  of that wilder stuff in his youth i'm not defending it but you're right uh paul watson takes over from
[3:04:43.040 --> 3:04:47.280]  france he's over there investigating right now we'll be back on the other side with paul watson
[3:04:47.280 --> 3:04:52.320]  don't forget bio truce selenium the purest out there in super high quality 25 off and sold out
[3:04:52.320 --> 3:04:57.360]  for months ben garrison's a new cartoon book at info war store dot com and so much more your
[3:04:57.360 --> 3:05:03.680]  purchase of products makes it all possible back to paul watson you might think the best ways to
[3:05:03.680 --> 3:05:08.400]  stop terrorism is maybe extreme bedding not allowing unbedded refugees into your home
[3:05:08.400 --> 3:05:13.120]  maybe not trying to do so many regime changes in middle eastern countries but you're all wrong
[3:05:13.120 --> 3:05:17.920]  in fact hillary clinton says a way to stop terrorism is to understand other cultures
[3:05:17.920 --> 3:05:22.080]  and their food yes really she also defended london mayor city con the man who once represented
[3:05:22.080 --> 3:05:27.200]  9 11 al-qaeda member zacharias missouri called moderate muslim's uncle tom's and said terrorism
[3:05:27.200 --> 3:05:32.080]  was part and parcel to living in a major city and she added con has shown steady determined
[3:05:32.080 --> 3:05:35.760]  leadership hillary said the best way to combatting terror is to reach out to the world in order to
[3:05:35.760 --> 3:05:39.200]  understand people living in foreign countries getting to know one another learning about the
[3:05:39.200 --> 3:05:43.920]  experiences the lives the cultures the religions the food so this means we got to be like into
[3:05:43.920 --> 3:05:47.680]  stoning women cutting off their genitals and throwing gaze off buildings this is not a time
[3:05:47.680 --> 3:05:52.320]  to lash out to incite fear to use tragedy and terror for political gain said clinton a comment
[3:05:52.320 --> 3:05:56.000]  obviously aimed at donald trump and anyone else was correctly identified political correctness and
[3:05:56.000 --> 3:06:00.000]  tolerance of islam as creating a fertile ground for terrorist attacks in the western world robert

[3:07:56.640 --> 3:08:01.600]  in the info war that's info wars life dot com and vitamin mineral fusion take action now before we
[3:08:01.600 --> 3:08:14.000]  sell out broadcasting live from the un stronghold austin texas you're listening to the alex jones
[3:08:14.000 --> 3:08:24.160]  show and now your host paul joseph watson see it and the counterfeit news network has been
[3:08:24.160 --> 3:08:30.160]  caught stage managing a scene and then presenting it as if it were news on their fake news network
[3:08:30.160 --> 3:08:34.400]  so what's happening here is this is right outside the scene of the latest terrorist attack that
[3:08:34.400 --> 3:08:40.720]  happened in london over the weekend and this is cnn and their reporter becky anerson stage managing
[3:08:40.720 --> 3:08:46.320]  a small group of muslims who are carrying signs that are denouncing the terrorist attack and this
[3:08:46.320 --> 3:08:51.600]  is a clear violation of journalistic ethics because journalists are not supposed to be involved in
[3:08:51.600 --> 3:08:58.400]  what's called stage managing to manipulate scenes that are then presented as news you can see that
[3:08:58.400 --> 3:09:05.360]  the small group was allowed past the police line and the cnn crew here is literally directing them
[3:09:05.360 --> 3:09:11.040]  helping them get framed properly for their shot of course this footage was shot by a bystander
[3:09:11.040 --> 3:09:17.280]  and posted on twitter at mark entrow and this is what the viewers at home were presented as to what
[3:09:17.280 --> 3:09:22.560]  happened but of course those who were there in person saw something totally different look at
[3:09:22.560 --> 3:09:26.640]  this here you can see one of the cnn producers wearing their headphones telling them no no no
[3:09:26.640 --> 3:09:30.960]  move over a little bit more to your left then once the shot was framed up the way that they
[3:09:30.960 --> 3:09:43.040]  wanted to present it then the cnn reporter began her piece these are those are bystanders laughing
[3:09:43.040 --> 3:09:55.520]  and they said this is embarrassing
[3:10:00.960 --> 3:10:04.880]  now if you're thinking that this isn't really a big deal as long as those protesters weren't
[3:10:04.880 --> 3:10:10.640]  like paid actors let me just point out to you from the ethical journalist making responsible
[3:10:10.640 --> 3:10:16.320]  decisions in the digital age a book by gene foreman he writes most print photo journalists and
[3:10:16.320 --> 3:10:22.560]  let me add video journalists reject the stage managing of news photographs or news broadcasts
[3:10:22.560 --> 3:10:27.760]  that is directing the people being photographed to do something for the benefit of the camera
[3:10:27.760 --> 3:10:32.880]  these photo journalists argue that a post photograph cannot ethically be presented
[3:10:32.880 --> 3:10:38.800]  as a found moment a noteworthy example of stage managing occurred in the los angeles times
[3:10:38.800 --> 3:10:44.560]  in 1993 while covering a fire scene eight times photographer mike meadows suggested that a
[3:10:44.560 --> 3:10:50.560]  firefighter go to a swimming pool and pour water over his head to cool off the result was a stunning
[3:10:50.560 --> 3:10:55.680]  photograph but when the photo director larry armstrong discovered the circumstances in which
[3:10:55.680 --> 3:11:03.840]  the photo had been taken he suspended meadows when you manipulate the situation armstrong said
[3:11:03.840 --> 3:11:09.840]  you manipulate the news even the washington compost denounced the stage managing of that
[3:11:09.840 --> 3:11:16.880]  photo here's an old 1994 article about it la times gets burned by disaster photograph
[3:11:16.880 --> 3:11:21.600]  in a riveting picture carried by newspapers and magazines nationwide last fall a los angeles
[3:11:21.600 --> 3:11:25.840]  firefighter doused his head with water from a backyard swimming pool while the luxury home
[3:11:25.840 --> 3:11:31.920]  behind him was consumed by a spectacular blaze the los angeles times which was preparing to
[3:11:31.920 --> 3:11:36.800]  enter the photo for a Pulitzer prize now says it was staged by one of the paper's veteran
[3:11:36.800 --> 3:11:42.240]  photographers the times has suspended staffer mike meadows without pay for one week and
[3:11:42.240 --> 3:11:47.360]  cancelled plans to enter the picture in all prize competitions larry armstrong the paper's
[3:11:47.360 --> 3:11:52.720]  director of photography called the picture a quote fabrication we regard it as extremely serious he
[3:11:52.720 --> 3:11:59.520]  said this is a firing offense when you manipulate the situation you manipulate the news this is
[3:11:59.520 --> 3:12:05.040]  similar to when abc news was recently captured staging a crime scene so that they could appear
[3:12:05.040 --> 3:12:10.000]  that they were doing a news report from right where the crime was committed this is what viewers at
[3:12:10.000 --> 3:12:16.240]  home saw with the police line there just blowing in the wind but of course just like this recent
[3:12:16.240 --> 3:12:21.680]  example with cnn there were people that were gathered around to watch the people reporting on
[3:12:21.680 --> 3:12:28.000]  the news and people were taking photographs of what was actually happening and on social media
[3:12:28.000 --> 3:12:35.760]  we found this photo which clearly shows that the producers tied the fake crime scene tape
[3:12:35.760 --> 3:12:41.120]  themselves on two different tripods of course these are blatant violations of journalistic
[3:12:41.120 --> 3:12:46.400]  ethics but cnn and abc news aren't really journalists i guess they just don't care
[3:12:46.400 --> 3:12:49.680]  i'm mark dice thanks for watching subscribe to my channel if you're doing a check back here
[3:12:49.680 --> 3:12:56.160]  every day for new reports and i'll see you talking about cnn faking that muslim anti-sera
[3:12:56.160 --> 3:13:02.160]  protest a couple of days ago again the question i put to cnn if tommy robinson or someone of his
[3:13:02.160 --> 3:13:08.880]  ilk was staging an anti-sharia law protest would the police let him through a cordon would they
[3:13:08.880 --> 3:13:16.400]  situate muslim police officers next to him to give his message more credibility would cnn carefully
[3:13:16.400 --> 3:13:23.600]  set up the shot so it's perfect so they can gush about it so they can genuflect about it no no
[3:13:23.600 --> 3:13:29.840]  and no they wouldn't do any of those things they wouldn't even give his protest any attention
[3:13:29.840 --> 3:13:35.840]  and if they did it would be to criticize it it would be attack to attack it would be to smear
[3:13:35.840 --> 3:13:42.560]  tommy robinson as an islamophone that's what cnn would do under such a scenario of course in this
[3:13:42.560 --> 3:13:48.880]  scenario they carefully staged that protest whether the protesters were organic aware of it or not
[3:13:48.880 --> 3:13:55.280]  this was clearly done to push a narrative and they're culpable for staging fake news so their
[3:13:55.280 --> 3:14:02.800]  denial was completely pathetic they would have only behaved that way under those exact circumstances
[3:14:02.800 --> 3:14:09.040]  that is manipulating the viewing public that's what cnn are experts at doing so again their
[3:14:09.040 --> 3:14:15.680]  denial makes no sense it has zero credibility just as the mayor of london has zero credibility
[3:14:15.680 --> 3:14:20.400]  fox news reports london mayor corn suggests calling off trump state visits to britain
[3:14:21.040 --> 3:14:25.200]  not the first time he's done it london mayor sadeep corn escalated his war of words with
[3:14:25.200 --> 3:14:29.360]  president trump like monday suggesting the u.s president's planned state visits to britain
[3:14:29.360 --> 3:14:34.080]  should be cancelled speaking on channel four news corn said britain should not be rolling out the
[3:14:34.080 --> 3:14:39.600]  red carpet to the president of the usa in the circumstances what are the circumstances well
[3:14:39.600 --> 3:14:45.440]  corn got triggered by a few trump tweets calling him out as being weak on terrorism
[3:14:46.480 --> 3:14:52.000]  but sadeep corn is more upset over those tweets than the fact that we're actually letting real
[3:14:52.000 --> 3:14:58.400]  terrorists back into the uk oh no they're not the problem the isis jihadist leaving the country
[3:14:58.400 --> 3:15:04.960]  and coming back in from syria in iraq which the uk government has failed to do anything about won't
[3:15:04.960 --> 3:15:10.720]  deport them won't take their passports away if they're british citizens no they're not the problem
[3:15:10.720 --> 3:15:17.440]  donald trump is the problem he's the extremist and it's no surprise given that this is a guy
[3:15:17.440 --> 3:15:27.600]  who defended the 9 11 al-qaeda conspirator zikarius musui back what was it now at least 10 15 years
[3:15:27.600 --> 3:15:35.280]  ago it was a few years after 9 11 defended an al-qaeda terrorist demanded lewis farrakhan
[3:15:35.280 --> 3:15:40.960]  the nation of islam leader who's previously described jews as bloodsuckers and called hitler
[3:15:40.960 --> 3:15:48.640]  a very great man demanded he be allowed to enter the uk but donald trump can't enter the uk now
[3:15:48.640 --> 3:15:54.000]  don't get me wrong as long as somebody's not a physical violent danger i don't think anyone
[3:15:54.000 --> 3:16:00.160]  should be barred from entering the country simply because of their opinions like michael savage is
[3:16:00.160 --> 3:16:05.440]  barred from entering the country like richard spencer love him or hate him is banned from
[3:16:05.440 --> 3:16:12.240]  entering the uk no don't ban someone based on their opinions if they're an actual terrorist threat
[3:16:12.240 --> 3:16:18.160]  then yes ban them if they're donald trump the president of the free world no don't ban them
[3:16:18.160 --> 3:16:24.000]  absolutely insane there's an article out of dc whispers which really crystallizes
[3:16:25.200 --> 3:16:31.920]  the islamist nature of siddiq khan it says in 2004 khan defended the radical muslim scholar
[3:16:31.920 --> 3:16:38.960]  yusef al-karadawi who khan argued was being unfairly portrayed as an extremist by political
[3:16:38.960 --> 3:16:44.160]  conservatives in england and yet al-qadawi authored the book the the lawful and prohibited
[3:16:44.160 --> 3:16:50.720]  in islam listen to this which advocates for the subjugation of women and applauds and condones
[3:16:50.720 --> 3:16:58.800]  suicide bombings against israel which he considers to be god's justice that's the real al-qadawi
[3:16:58.800 --> 3:17:07.440]  the man siddiq khan says is not an extremist but donald trump is an extremist siddiq khan the same
[3:17:07.440 --> 3:17:15.040]  guy who in a 2009 interview said that moderate muslims are quote uncle tom's the same guy that
[3:17:15.040 --> 3:17:22.160]  appeared on a stage with isis sympathizers at least nine times during his campaigns to become
[3:17:22.160 --> 3:17:31.840]  london mayor he again defended the 9 11 terrorist zikaris musawi the al-qaeda conspirator the dc
[3:17:31.840 --> 3:17:38.160]  wispers article goes on please ask yourself how it is that an anti-semite who is now telling london
[3:17:38.160 --> 3:17:44.320]  as the islamist terror attacks should be accepted as a way of life for them don't forget that he said
[3:17:45.040 --> 3:17:49.600]  terror in major cities was a part part and parcel of life which by the way is
[3:17:51.120 --> 3:17:58.160]  a method by which islamists by which jihadists use to encourage submission and capitulation
[3:17:58.160 --> 3:18:04.400]  now our own mayor of london is doing their bidding for them by telling londoners to just
[3:18:04.400 --> 3:18:12.400]  get used to it and just yesterday this is out of westmonster.com he again shared a platform
[3:18:12.400 --> 3:18:17.600]  with an islamist senior politicians drew criticism last night after inviting a representative from
[3:18:17.600 --> 3:18:24.240]  the muslim council of britain to share a platform with them following the london bridge attacks
[3:18:24.240 --> 3:18:30.560]  they were criticized by leading muslim reformists including majid noaz sharing a platform with haroon
[3:18:30.560 --> 3:18:39.120]  khan secretary general of the muslim council of britain this guy is an advocate of the caliphate
[3:18:39.120 --> 3:18:47.280]  just like i this is absolutely incredible the mayor of london saying that donald trump should
[3:18:47.280 --> 3:18:53.680]  de facto be banned from visiting the uk should not have a state visit while he's literally
[3:18:53.680 --> 3:18:59.680]  defending actual terrorists while he's saying that people who say hitler was great who say jews
[3:18:59.680 --> 3:19:05.440]  are bloodsuckers they should be allowed to enter the uk and i agree i'm a free speech purist i
[3:19:05.440 --> 3:19:10.160]  think they should as long as they don't pose a physical danger to anyone they should be allowed
[3:19:10.160 --> 3:19:15.360]  to enter the uk but the fact he defends them and advocates that they be allowed to enter
[3:19:15.360 --> 3:19:20.560]  while saying donald trump's state visit shouldn't happen tells you everything you need to know
[3:19:20.560 --> 3:19:26.640]  about sadeek khan and i'll be doing a video about him probably tonight or tomorrow
[3:19:28.240 --> 3:19:33.680]  london bridge terrorist was allowed to work at west minster station despite known jihadist views
[3:19:33.680 --> 3:19:37.600]  we're finding out more and more about the three individuals responsible for the attack
[3:19:38.160 --> 3:19:43.120]  kuram shazad but one of the three london bridge attackers was allowed to work at west minster
[3:19:43.120 --> 3:19:48.720]  tube station even after he featured in a tv documentary about british jihadist he was in
[3:19:48.720 --> 3:19:56.640]  the documentary it was being flaunted he was allowed to work in a tube station directly under

[3:27:05.360 --> 3:27:10.400]  now in case you've been living under rock for the past few days the united kingdom has been hit with
[3:27:10.400 --> 3:27:17.440]  three major terror attacks in less than three months and what are authorities seemingly most
[3:27:17.440 --> 3:27:23.920]  concerned about in some cases well cheshire police put out a facebook post saying quote
[3:27:23.920 --> 3:27:29.440]  we would remind all social media users to think carefully about what they are saying before posting
[3:27:29.440 --> 3:27:35.680]  messages online although you may believe your message is acceptable you may believe you're
[3:27:35.680 --> 3:27:42.400]  not committing a thought crime other people may take offense and you could face a large fine
[3:27:42.400 --> 3:27:48.400]  or up to two years in prison if your message is deemed to have broken the law so now you have
[3:27:48.400 --> 3:27:55.440]  an actual police department in the united kingdom in the light of these terror attacks telling people
[3:27:55.440 --> 3:28:03.840]  that causing offense could land them in jail for two years let that sink in of course they could
[3:28:03.840 --> 3:28:08.880]  be concerned with catching actual criminals and terrorists but no they're not concerned with
[3:28:08.880 --> 3:28:16.560]  regulating your free speech on facebook they're more concerned with identifying 15 year old
[3:28:16.560 --> 3:28:28.080]  ukip supporters as terrorists yes that actually happened bright bar reports teachers report 15 year
[3:28:28.080 --> 3:28:35.280]  old boy to government extremism watchdog for jokes about katelyn jenna and campaigning for ukip now
[3:28:35.280 --> 3:28:42.400]  bear in mind that solford university attended by the manchester bomber campaigned against the
[3:28:42.400 --> 3:28:48.960]  terrorism program so they actually rallied against a program designed to identify terrorists
[3:28:50.400 --> 3:28:57.680]  and who are people on the left identifying as terrorists islamist extremist no 15 year old
[3:28:57.680 --> 3:29:05.280]  members of ukip absolutely incredible michael higginson a 15 year old student at vision studio
[3:29:05.280 --> 3:29:10.960]  school in mansfield says that his teachers who openly back to the labor party the far left
[3:29:10.960 --> 3:29:18.240]  party here in britain actually reported him to authorities as a potential terrorist because
[3:29:18.240 --> 3:29:26.880]  he's a ukip supporter the third biggest political party in britain he talks about immigration he
[3:29:26.880 --> 3:29:34.240]  talks about supporting marina le penne in france he god forbid made a joke about katelyn jenna
[3:29:34.240 --> 3:29:43.680]  and now he's been identified or at least reported as a terrorist let that sink in we'll be back
[3:29:43.680 --> 3:29:48.800]  it's the alex jones show live fourth hour breaking news at info wars dot com don't go away
[3:29:50.960 --> 3:29:57.680]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[3:29:57.680 --> 3:30:07.200]  you might think the best ways to stop terrorism is maybe extreme bedding not allowing unbedded
[3:30:07.200 --> 3:30:11.840]  refugees into your home maybe not trying to do so many regime changes in middle eastern countries
[3:30:11.840 --> 3:30:17.520]  love you're all wrong in fact hillary clinton says a way to stop terrorism is to understand other
[3:30:17.520 --> 3:30:21.600]  cultures and their food yes really she also defended london mayor city con the man who once
[3:30:21.600 --> 3:30:26.800]  represented 9 11 al-qaeda member zacharias missouri called moderate muslim's uncle tom's and said
[3:30:26.800 --> 3:30:31.680]  terrorism was part and parcel to living in a major city and she added con has shown a steady
[3:30:31.680 --> 3:30:35.360]  determined leadership hillary said the best way to combatting terror is to reach out to the world
[3:30:35.360 --> 3:30:38.880]  in order to understand people living in foreign countries getting to know one another learning
[3:30:38.880 --> 3:30:43.280]  about the experiences the lives the cultures the religions the food so does this mean we
[3:30:43.280 --> 3:30:47.040]  got to be like into stoning women cutting off their genitals and throwing gaze off buildings
[3:30:47.040 --> 3:30:51.360]  this is not a time to lash out to incite fear to use tragedy and terror for political gain
[3:30:51.360 --> 3:30:55.200]  said clinton a comment obviously aimed at donald trump and anyone else who's correctly identified
[3:30:55.200 --> 3:30:58.800]  political correctness and tolerance of islam as creating a fertile ground for terrorist attacks

[3:33:24.400 --> 3:33:32.400]  somewhere up a mountain in occupied france former site of the french resistance who actually occupied
[3:33:32.400 --> 3:33:38.000]  this house that i'm living in not much resistance going on in france anymore is there after the
[3:33:38.000 --> 3:33:45.360]  election of the globalist immanuel macron now who says that the left is soft on terrorism
[3:33:45.360 --> 3:33:52.480]  because they're outing the real threat which is 15 year old ukip activists i'm going to read this
[3:33:52.480 --> 3:33:59.440]  whole story because it's absolutely jaw dropping a member of ukip's youth wing has been labeled far
[3:33:59.440 --> 3:34:04.880]  right by his school and reported to the government's prevent de-radicalization program which is
[3:34:04.880 --> 3:34:12.000]  designed to stop young people from being drawn into terrorism an activist for the third biggest
[3:34:12.000 --> 3:34:18.640]  political party in britain think about that for a second based on the 2015 election ukip is the
[3:34:18.640 --> 3:34:26.960]  third biggest political party in britain this 15 year old student is an activist in ukip he's been
[3:34:26.960 --> 3:34:34.640]  reported to the government as a terrorist by his own school he told brybart london the school's
[3:34:34.640 --> 3:34:40.560]  safeguarding officer told him he could have committed a hate crime that they needed to find
[3:34:40.560 --> 3:34:46.480]  out if he was an extremist before he was subsequently interviewed by two police officers
[3:34:46.480 --> 3:34:53.360]  they actually sent cops to the school because he supports ukip the student said he is vocal in
[3:34:53.360 --> 3:34:59.360]  his support for ukip in citizenship lessons god forbid he wants immigrants coming into the country
[3:34:59.360 --> 3:35:05.200]  to actually be able to speak english that must mean he's an extremist right and has tweeted
[3:35:05.200 --> 3:35:11.280]  approvingly about right wing french presidential candidate marine le penne who about 40 percent of
[3:35:11.280 --> 3:35:17.600]  the french people supported can't support her you're an extremist he claims there were two reasons
[3:35:17.600 --> 3:35:24.000]  for his referral to prevent again to remind you prevent is the government program that identifies
[3:35:24.000 --> 3:35:30.880]  terrorists so why did they report him well he told a mildly politically incorrect joke about
[3:35:30.880 --> 3:35:36.640]  transgendered celebrity kaitlyn jenna can't do that that means you're a terrorist which he admitted
[3:35:36.640 --> 3:35:43.600]  was crude he had also brought ukip leaflets into school oh my god he actually brought terrorist
[3:35:43.600 --> 3:35:51.120]  propaganda ukip leaflets into school which he handed out after lessons or at least intended to
[3:35:51.120 --> 3:35:56.720]  when campaigning for the local elections the literature which remained in sealed bags was
[3:35:56.720 --> 3:36:04.800]  confiscated and he was sold he could only retrieve it with a parent or guardian oh god the school also
[3:36:04.800 --> 3:36:11.040]  allegedly tracked mr higginson's internet search history and claimed he had viewed the britain
[3:36:11.040 --> 3:36:18.400]  first website again hate speech terrorism can't look at a website even though he denies viewing it
[3:36:19.360 --> 3:36:23.680]  after the allegation surfaced he said teachers told him he was not allowed to discuss his
[3:36:23.680 --> 3:36:30.720]  opinions with other students in his free time so they literally told him you can't even talk about
[3:36:30.720 --> 3:36:38.080]  ukip outside of school to your fellow students that's hate speech again third biggest political
[3:36:38.080 --> 3:36:43.840]  party in britain quote to tell me that i can't express any political opinions because it is a
[3:36:43.840 --> 3:36:50.800]  it's a public building is complete contradiction because they some teachers back labor leader jeremy
[3:36:50.800 --> 3:36:55.760]  corbin he said the officers were friendly had no concerns about his beliefs and did not appear to
[3:36:55.760 --> 3:37:01.280]  consider him a threat however they did question his views on immigration and the school has said he
[3:37:01.280 --> 3:37:09.920]  could face a follow-up meeting that's right you can't say that 300 000 plus immigrants net pouring
[3:37:09.920 --> 3:37:18.080]  into the uk every year might be a bit of a problem that means you're an extremist the school is not
[3:37:18.080 --> 3:37:22.640]  alone in reporting ukip sporting people to do authorities and it goes through previous examples
[3:37:22.640 --> 3:37:30.400]  where people viewed a ukip website on a school computer someone in yorkshire referred was referred
[3:37:30.400 --> 3:37:36.480]  again to the the prevent terrorist program for opposing the burka so you can't say that
[3:37:37.520 --> 3:37:42.000]  women being covered in beekeepers outfits looks a little bit odd and might be a problem
[3:37:43.040 --> 3:37:47.360]  with regards to criminal activity now you're an extremist you're the terrorist
[3:37:47.360 --> 3:37:53.440]  following the killing of joe cox and people he's promised to refocus prevent on the so-called far
[3:37:53.440 --> 3:37:59.920]  right and the large and growing proportions that's targeted come from this group absolutely jaw
[3:37:59.920 --> 3:38:09.040]  dropping insanity amidst three massive terrorist attacks in the last three months alone under three
[3:38:09.040 --> 3:38:15.920]  months this school is reporting a 15 year old kid as a potential terrorist because he's handing out
[3:38:15.920 --> 3:38:25.440]  frigging ukip leaflets he's saying mass immigration's a problem he's making a joke about katlyn jenna
[3:38:25.440 --> 3:38:31.840]  that means he's a terrorist this is the mindset that pervades this country remember the story
[3:38:31.840 --> 3:38:37.520]  back from a few years ago there was an immigrant couple i think they were polish they weren't even
[3:38:37.520 --> 3:38:45.840]  british they supported ukip they adopted children by all accounts extremely good parents extremely
[3:38:45.840 --> 3:38:56.080]  caring parents they adopted a baby social services in rotherham the scene of uh 13 what was it 1300
[3:38:56.080 --> 3:39:02.640]  girls at least being trafficked for years and years by muslim rape gangs authorities turned
[3:39:02.640 --> 3:39:08.080]  a blind eye because it would be politically incorrect to actually catch the pedophiles
[3:39:08.080 --> 3:39:17.040]  they took the baby from these loving caring foster parents because they supported ukip
[3:39:18.960 --> 3:39:23.280]  can't support the third biggest political party in britain you'll have your children
[3:39:23.280 --> 3:39:31.120]  snatched you'll be reported as a terrorist that's the mindset dominating the united kingdom right
[3:39:31.120 --> 3:39:43.120]  now so is it
[3:39:43.120 --> 3:39:53.120]  you
[3:39:54.320 --> 3:40:03.120]  you can run on for a long time run on for a long time run on for a long time
[3:40:03.760 --> 3:40:09.360]  sooner or later gotta cut you down sooner or later gotta cut you down
[3:40:09.360 --> 3:40:17.360]  go tell that long tongue wire go and tell that six and a half million refugees last five years
[3:40:17.360 --> 3:40:22.400]  into europe in the uk do you ban everybody's free speech and have a big internet police force
[3:40:22.400 --> 3:40:27.520]  internationally to stop islamic terror or do you stop bringing people in from the fell state of
[3:40:27.520 --> 3:40:34.480]  libya the fell state of syria the fell state of iraq the the uh obviously you stop bringing in the
[3:40:34.480 --> 3:40:42.000]  people that are doing the attacks but let's go further the eu the united nations the different
[3:40:42.000 --> 3:40:47.520]  soros funds that are openly funding the arab spring that are openly funding and promoting all
[3:40:47.520 --> 3:40:55.200]  this jihadist garbage they need to get in trouble for what they've done and they need to stop
[3:40:55.200 --> 3:41:00.720]  financing the most radical forms of islam to go around conquering the middle east it is a fact
[3:41:00.720 --> 3:41:06.800]  that there are a lot of america haters in this world and it is a fact there are a lot of globalists
[3:41:06.800 --> 3:41:11.040]  that are trying to destroy the freedoms we have in the west the middle class and that they are
[3:41:11.040 --> 3:41:21.120]  allied with the most nasty despicable disgusting murderous forms of ortodox wahabi islam now you
[3:41:21.120 --> 3:41:28.320]  think about europe five million military age men many of them off the battlefields of the middle east
[3:41:28.320 --> 3:41:32.960]  who kill each other in their own towns and cities one upping each other on who's the most islamic
[3:41:33.600 --> 3:41:39.760]  you bring in these radicalized people that are constantly competing with each other for who can
[3:41:39.760 --> 3:41:45.520]  be more backward then you have the left that's so busy apologizing for them who's been embossing
[3:41:45.520 --> 3:41:52.080]  them so long they will never say that they were in the wrong so they'll never back off defending
[3:41:52.080 --> 3:41:57.040]  it where you've got major newspapers and major publications saying let's not be mean to muslims
[3:41:57.040 --> 3:42:03.200]  let's back off let's not say this is an islamic attack remember obama would never call terror
[3:42:03.200 --> 3:42:08.640]  islamic terror or radical islamic terror that's because of the whacked out islamic ideology
[3:42:08.640 --> 3:42:16.720]  it's not controlled by the globalist it's just let in the doors just opened it hates liberals
[3:42:16.720 --> 3:42:26.160]  gays lesbians rock and roll pop music they went and targeted a bunch of teenagers you know dressed up
[3:42:27.680 --> 3:42:36.960]  in many cases provocatively because that's what drives radical orthodox islamic wall
[3:42:36.960 --> 3:42:42.400]  they kill women that go out dressed like that in public they rape women and if the woman
[3:42:42.400 --> 3:42:50.320]  complains she's charged with adultery she's charged with the sex crime that's a fact
[3:42:51.600 --> 3:42:56.880]  and then they bring in five million men military aged men other million or so
[3:42:56.880 --> 3:43:02.880]  women and children you watch the videos of thousands coming in none of marold men
[3:43:02.880 --> 3:43:08.400]  none of marold women because they're being sent on the jihad there's what five pillars of jihad
[3:43:08.400 --> 3:43:14.720]  you've also got to go to mecca at least once in life for the hodge but bigger than the hodge is
[3:43:14.720 --> 3:43:21.200]  when the jihad comes the physical jihad you go forth and isis said four years ago isis
[3:43:22.320 --> 3:43:27.440]  announces plans to use refugees to flood europe type it in you'll get info wars calm
[3:43:27.440 --> 3:43:34.000]  and zero hedge first from 2014 four years ago five years ago there it is that's september
[3:43:34.000 --> 3:43:40.400]  eight 2015 that's one of the older ones flashback isis threatens to send 500 000 migrants to europe
[3:43:40.400 --> 3:43:48.720]  as psychological weapon they go on to announce embedded within them are isis fighters now
[3:43:48.720 --> 3:43:56.240]  estimated 3 000 in england 500 plots they have stopped or they're ongoing that was last week so
[3:43:56.800 --> 3:44:02.160]  again we're acting like this is a mystery we said you're bringing in people out of failed syria
[3:44:02.160 --> 3:44:07.600]  failed libya where our governments went funded the revolutions to overthrow secular governments in
[3:44:07.600 --> 3:44:12.640]  egypt as well then put radicals in charge that blow up every church murder every christian kill
[3:44:12.640 --> 3:44:20.000]  every jew every shiite every non radical muslim they can get their hands on taxpayers are paying
[3:44:20.000 --> 3:44:26.160]  to bring this in to create a class of civilizations so that they can then say we've got to regulate
[3:44:26.160 --> 3:44:30.720]  the internet we've got to take free speech so you bring them in they create the crisis
[3:44:30.720 --> 3:44:34.960]  oh we got to get rid of internet internet freedom now something sorrows openly said he wants oh we
[3:44:34.960 --> 3:44:39.360]  got to have an international group do it oh we've got to you take your rights away now we've got to
[3:44:39.360 --> 3:44:46.880]  set up checkpoints on the highways but we're going to bring in more of the islamism and we are back
[3:44:47.520 --> 3:44:51.840]  live it's the fourth hour of the alex joneshow hosted from this internet connection which is
[3:44:51.840 --> 3:44:58.400]  basically two tin cans and a bit of string because france is such a dreadful country in terms of
[3:44:58.400 --> 3:45:05.680]  economic activity that when you try and buy a 4g connection and it runs out of data after two days
[3:45:05.680 --> 3:45:11.440]  you literally try and give them your money and they say no we don't want your money that's friends
[3:45:11.440 --> 3:45:18.800]  for you absolutely incredible you literally try to pay them like every two days here take my money
[3:45:18.800 --> 3:45:24.640]  take my money no we don't want your money no internet data for you that's friends that's why
[3:45:24.640 --> 3:45:31.120]  i'm leaving but we were talking about the 15-year-old ukip activist identified reported as a terrorist
[3:45:31.120 --> 3:45:36.080]  to the government's prevent program so don't say the set the left is soft on terror they're really
[3:45:36.080 --> 3:45:41.440]  hardcore on terror when it comes to quote right wing extremists which is basically anyone who
[3:45:41.440 --> 3:45:47.840]  has a different opinion so you had a baby who was taken from a loving foster care couple
[3:45:48.480 --> 3:45:53.760]  because again they supported ukip literally punishing people for their political opinions
[3:45:53.760 --> 3:46:00.560]  by snatching their kids and reporting them as terrorists that's progressive bright bar reports
[3:46:00.560 --> 3:46:07.360]  poland refusing to import muslims is only proven counter terror method that's kind of interesting
[3:46:07.360 --> 3:46:11.520]  given that bright bar just fired someone for basically saying the same thing in a tweet
[3:46:12.160 --> 3:46:18.800]  they're now publishing this article which is from the uh i think it's a minister there in poland
[3:46:18.800 --> 3:46:25.280]  the law and justice mep who says the only way to protect poland from islamic terror attacks is to
[3:46:25.280 --> 3:46:30.560]  not allow muslims to migrate en masse when it comes to reducing the chances of poland being
[3:46:30.560 --> 3:46:37.280]  hit by islamist terror attacks the only proven method is to not allow in muslim migrants that's
[3:46:37.280 --> 3:46:45.200]  uh rizard shineki who told local radio after an attack on london killed seven and injured 48 others
[3:46:45.200 --> 3:46:51.840]  so he's basically out saying publicly that the only sure-fi method of avoiding islamist terror
[3:46:51.840 --> 3:46:59.040]  attacks is not to import huge numbers of muslims into your country again interesting given that
[3:46:59.040 --> 3:47:06.080]  bright bar just fired a columnist for saying virtually that exact thing in a tweet this was
[3:47:06.080 --> 3:47:11.440]  a report that went up on info wars dot com last night swedish women proved their tolerance by
[3:47:11.440 --> 3:47:18.960]  having sex with refugees swedish women are proving their tolerance proving how progressive they are
[3:47:18.960 --> 3:47:23.760]  by having sex with refugee children who are actually grown adult men now of course the
[3:47:23.760 --> 3:47:31.040]  official government study in sweden found that 75 percent or more of quote child refugees are
[3:47:31.040 --> 3:47:37.600]  actually adults they did the medical tests and confirmed it so now you have a spate of women
[3:47:37.600 --> 3:47:45.120]  in sweden who are taking in migrants into their own homes being asked to sleep with the migrants
[3:47:45.120 --> 3:47:51.280]  this is a message that appeared on a left-wing blog called blank spot so this is them admitting it
[3:47:51.280 --> 3:47:57.200]  on their own left-wing blogs the woman who took in a migrant said quote from time to time he gets
[3:47:57.200 --> 3:48:04.160]  to stay the night at my place adding now the sofa doesn't work anymore he gets to sleep with me in my
[3:48:04.160 --> 3:48:12.000]  bed that's tolerance i text a friend help i have to take him in my bed she responds we all do it
[3:48:12.000 --> 3:48:18.480]  don't worry that's how it is give him intimacy that's all you can do so it's literally got to the
[3:48:18.480 --> 3:48:25.440]  level and we we featured the reports about this before whether call a volunteer charity workers
[3:48:25.440 --> 3:48:31.680]  there are literally prostitutes for migrants and it's the other volunteers that blow the whistle
[3:48:31.680 --> 3:48:39.120]  on them you had a founder of a charity care for Callie who left her husband to go and have a
[3:48:39.120 --> 3:48:46.400]  relationship with a Tunisian migrant so it's gone beyond virtue signaling now it's gone off into some
[3:48:46.400 --> 3:48:53.200]  bizarre fetish world where these swedish women most of them in their 50s and 60s who are taking in
[3:48:53.200 --> 3:48:59.760]  these migrants child refugees they're actually literally 20 and 30 years old they have full
[3:48:59.760 --> 3:49:07.760]  beards six foot two you've seen the pictures taking them into their homes they demand sex
[3:49:09.120 --> 3:49:13.520]  the swedish women are perplexed should i offer them sex should i allow myself to basically
[3:49:13.520 --> 3:49:20.400]  become a prostitute they phone their friends they say yes that's the new tolerance is having sex with
[3:49:20.400 --> 3:49:28.560]  migrants this is who we're dealing with this is the mindset gateway pundit reports melbourne islamist
[3:49:28.560 --> 3:49:34.480]  killer was refugee from somalia again for about three hours they said oh i wonder if this is
[3:49:34.480 --> 3:49:40.240]  political we just don't know if it's terror related even as he was screaming out his attack was for
[3:49:40.240 --> 3:49:45.840]  isis and al-qaeda kind of like during the orlando attack where he literally told police this is for
[3:49:45.840 --> 3:49:52.480]  isis and still over a year later people claim it was about frigging gun control
[3:49:52.480 --> 3:50:00.240]  so he said it was for isis and al-qaeda again killed one man injured three police officers
[3:50:00.240 --> 3:50:07.760]  he was a refugee from somalia isn't multiculturalism isn't cultural enrichment working out just great
[3:50:08.720 --> 3:50:14.320]  the third perpetrator of the london attack has been identified as moroccan yusef zagbar
[3:50:14.320 --> 3:50:22.720]  born in january 1995 in morocco to a moroccan father last year he was stopped at the balonia
[3:50:22.720 --> 3:50:31.040]  airport while trying to fly to turkey to reach syria so again he was trying to get to syria
[3:50:31.040 --> 3:50:37.520]  to join isis the italian authority stopped him despite the fact they're allowing in 200 000
[3:50:37.520 --> 3:50:42.560]  migrants unvetted every year even they were intelligent enough to stop him he's allowed
[3:50:42.560 --> 3:50:49.440]  to come back into britain they do absolutely nothing why are we allowing people into our
[3:50:49.440 --> 3:50:56.160]  country who are literally fighting alongside isis jihadis who go on to carry out deadly
