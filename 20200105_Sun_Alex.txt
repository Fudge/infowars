[00:00.000 --> 00:12.860]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[00:12.860 --> 00:17.600]  front lines of the Info War.
[00:17.600 --> 00:25.080]  Gawker, President Barack Obama, has his fingerprints all over the sabotage of the Trump administration
[00:25.080 --> 00:30.080]  and ultimately the future of the United States. From the allegations of the wiretapping of
[00:30.080 --> 00:36.640]  Trump's phones during the 2016 campaign, to the ongoing details of the bar Durham investigation,
[00:36.640 --> 00:41.680]  Barack Obama and his Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, just keep the hits coming.
[00:41.680 --> 00:47.440]  It did not start with Donald Trump. He is a symptom, not the cause.
[00:47.440 --> 00:53.840]  Lo and behold, the point man behind the siege on the American embassy in Iraq, Hadi al-Amiri,
[00:53.840 --> 00:59.440]  was hosted in the Oval Office by President Obama in 2011. According to the Daily Mail,
[00:59.440 --> 01:05.760]  Amiri is head of the Bader Korps, an Iranian vassal, which despite fighting alongside the
[01:05.760 --> 01:14.600]  U.S. against ISIS in 2014 and 2015, has received funding and arms from Iran's Islamic Revolutionary
[01:14.600 --> 01:19.480]  Guard, a designated terror group. President Trump had stirred a hornet's nest after he
[01:19.480 --> 01:26.320]  ordered U.S. Air Force jets to decimate Hezbollah bases in 25 were killed. And now the smoke
[01:26.320 --> 01:31.200]  is clearing on the propaganda's hit job on the American embassy in Iraq. The sniveling
[01:31.200 --> 01:36.680]  cowards in the media want another Benghazi. And what they got was a real-time response
[01:36.680 --> 01:41.800]  from the commander-in-chief. They came immediately and it's in great shape.
[01:41.800 --> 01:46.960]  As you know, this will not be a Benghazi. Benghazi should never have happened. The Iranian regime's
[01:46.960 --> 01:53.840]  aggression in the region, including the use of proxy fighters to destabilize its neighbors,
[01:53.840 --> 01:58.240]  must end and it must end now. Now the left, led by the rhetoric of Joe Biden
[01:58.240 --> 02:03.040]  and Ilhan Omar, are showing their hand as the bulwark of national security that they
[02:03.040 --> 02:08.800]  are. As Biden called the bold action that of throwing a stick of dynamite into a tinderbox,
[02:08.800 --> 02:14.320]  and Omar vowed to step in and stop Trump. Of course, the truth didn't slow down the
[02:14.320 --> 02:19.720]  Mockingbird Media's love affair with terrorists. As Steve Watson writes, the leftist media
[02:19.720 --> 02:26.560]  in the U.S. started off 2020 with a cacophony of fake news by labeling Hezbollah terrorists
[02:26.560 --> 02:32.440]  who attempted to storm the U.S. embassy and Baghdad as protesters. The pictures from the
[02:32.440 --> 02:38.320]  mob attack clearly show that it was led by members of trans militia units in Iraq, which
[02:38.320 --> 02:41.760]  have been absorbed into the Iraqi security forces.
[02:41.760 --> 02:46.680]  John Kerry's underhanded violation of the foreign diplomacy of the executive office
[02:46.680 --> 02:52.040]  is a sobering example of the left's true danger to our national security.
[02:52.040 --> 02:57.760]  You know, John Kerry speaks to him a lot. John Kerry tells him not to call. That's the violation
[02:57.760 --> 03:03.440]  of the Logan Act. And frankly, he should be prosecuted on that. But my people don't want
[03:03.440 --> 03:07.680]  to do anything that's only the Democrats do that kind of stuff, you know?
[03:07.680 --> 03:12.920]  If it were the opposite way, they'd prosecute him under the Logan Act.
[03:12.920 --> 03:18.680]  While Obama's ties to the Muslim Brotherhood during the toppling of regimes in North Africa
[03:18.680 --> 03:20.120]  is indisputable.
[03:20.120 --> 03:25.760]  And what I indicated tonight to President Mubarak is my belief that an orderly transition must
[03:25.760 --> 03:34.080]  be meaningful, it must be peaceful, and it must begin now. Furthermore, the process must
[03:34.080 --> 03:40.200]  include a broad spectrum of Egyptian voices and opposition parties.
[03:40.200 --> 03:45.360]  The most important thing for me is to have real friendship between the Egyptians and
[03:45.360 --> 03:46.360]  the Americans.
[03:46.360 --> 03:47.360]  So what does that mean? What does that mean?
[03:47.360 --> 03:52.880]  Yeah, what that means is mutual, uh, talented relationships.
[03:52.880 --> 03:57.800]  Jubilation erupting on Tahir Square as the news spread that President Morsi had been
[03:57.800 --> 04:04.040]  deposed. Yet another Egyptian leader taken down by the people on this now iconic square.
[04:04.040 --> 04:09.720]  Those ties to Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood President Mohammed Morsi snaked a path to an
[04:09.720 --> 04:16.000]  Iran that Obama had generously rewarded for a nuclear disarmament deal that failed.
[04:16.000 --> 04:20.200]  Where will Obama and Hillary's signature of sabotage appear next?
[04:20.200 --> 04:24.600]  And how much of the Iranian conflict is being driven by their influence?
[04:24.600 --> 04:32.120]  John Baum reporting, ladies and gentlemen, this is the Alex Jones show on this Sunday,

[05:57.120 --> 06:03.520]  out and fight for freedom. The three days of morning are over for Iran's head general
[06:03.520 --> 06:10.880]  Soleimani. The red flag of war has been hoisted above the main mosque in Tehran. And the Ayatollah
[06:10.880 --> 06:21.160]  has come out and issued an $80 million murder for hire contract or a bounty on Islamic fatwa
[06:21.160 --> 06:27.480]  for Shiites anywhere in the world and they're in almost every country or for anybody else
[06:27.480 --> 06:32.760]  for that matter who can assassinate President Trump. You can read the quotes here where
[06:32.760 --> 06:39.960]  they say the yellow hair madman bring us his head. You'll get $80 million U.S. That's
[06:39.960 --> 06:47.240]  $10 for every Iranian citizen. So a huge escalation. They promised to hit 35 targets. Trump says
[06:47.240 --> 06:52.800]  if they do, we'll hit 50 plus targets. A huge escalation. Now I want to be clear before
[06:52.800 --> 07:00.240]  I lay out how huge this is obviously that I have never been for offensive war. I am
[07:00.240 --> 07:06.160]  not for these strikes. And then I have not endorsed what the president did. But I have
[07:06.160 --> 07:13.000]  laid out why I believe he did it. And it's important to understand the players geopolitically
[07:13.000 --> 07:17.960]  to see the president's perspective. Because if you understand his perspective, you understand
[07:17.960 --> 07:22.960]  how this is really a deep state war playing out on the grand chessboard that is central
[07:22.960 --> 07:30.120]  Asia. So let's lay this out. You'll remember a few years ago, the ISIS al Qaeda forces
[07:30.120 --> 07:36.000]  with Saudi Arabia kept launching false flag chemical attacks against Assad and blaming
[07:36.000 --> 07:43.320]  him to try to bring Trump in. And when Trump finally the third time blew up a chemical dump
[07:43.320 --> 07:50.640]  and went along with the propaganda, I blew up. I'm not in a cold for Donald Trump. His
[07:50.640 --> 07:56.080]  family. All these people. All right, see, I shouldn't be live right now. When are we
[07:56.080 --> 08:03.920]  going on the satellite? And I did that because I've gone to the mat for Trump. I've been
[08:03.920 --> 08:07.920]  deplatformed for Trump. I've been sued more than 30 times for Trump. I had been persecuted
[08:07.920 --> 08:13.080]  for Trump and he promised to be anti war. He talked about how the previous attacks
[08:13.080 --> 08:18.800]  had been false flags in Syria, how Hillary and Obama had helped found modern ISIS, how
[08:18.800 --> 08:23.680]  they'd run the Arab Spring. He was fighting to keep Europe's borders closed. He was really
[08:23.680 --> 08:27.840]  understanding the situation, being advised by Senator Rand Paul, being advised by Ted
[08:27.840 --> 08:32.400]  Cruz, who also understood these facts. And so when I saw that, I thought it was like
[08:32.400 --> 08:38.080]  in the past, the beginning of a whole bunch of other strikes of a full on war. But instead,
[08:38.080 --> 08:43.040]  Trump did it. That's why the Russians back down, they understood so that the Warhawks
[08:43.040 --> 08:48.440]  and the neocons couldn't say that Trump was soft and then remove him from office completely.
[08:48.440 --> 08:53.720]  So I then began to understand Trump's more sophisticated policy as he tries to get us
[08:53.720 --> 09:00.440]  out of Afghanistan, as he got us out of Syria. And so now we know that Obama and Kerry, mainly
[09:00.440 --> 09:05.680]  Hillary some, but mainly Obama and Kerry have been behind the scenes. Well, I'm behind
[09:05.680 --> 09:10.780]  the scenes. They've been public. Ian Iran saying ignore Trump and do stuff in the straight
[09:10.780 --> 09:14.400]  of her mousse and you'll be able to embarrass him and we can remove him. So they've been
[09:14.400 --> 09:20.160]  hijacking ships, blowing up ships, sinking ships, taking ships over, shooting down drones.
[09:20.160 --> 09:25.480]  And Trump over and over again has said, no, we're not going to strike or call the strikes
[09:25.480 --> 09:31.040]  back. So they thought he was weak. And that's why this particular general who was running
[09:31.040 --> 09:37.320]  their international operations had previously launched operations with improvised explosive
[09:37.320 --> 09:41.920]  devices made in Iran against US troops all over the world, killing thousands. And he
[09:41.920 --> 09:48.720]  was doing it again and had already launched offensives against US troops in Iraq. As Trump
[09:48.720 --> 09:53.880]  was announcing their drawdown and that they were going to be leaving, he was coming into
[09:53.880 --> 09:59.120]  the power vacuum to try to take over Iraq, which again would cause a civil war between
[09:59.120 --> 10:06.200]  the Shiites and the Sunnis. So Trump is legitimately trying to stabilize as we pull out, letting
[10:06.200 --> 10:11.400]  Iran know you better let Iraq be their own country again, instead of destabilization,
[10:11.400 --> 10:15.680]  or we're going to take your leadership out because Saudi Arabia and Israel will get involved
[10:15.680 --> 10:21.560]  if we didn't do that. So Trump is doing this as he said to stop a war, straight shooting.
[10:21.560 --> 10:25.760]  He always tells the truth, folks. He does what he says he'll do. It's very pragmatic, very
[10:25.760 --> 10:32.280]  easy to understand. I love it as a Texan. And he's saying, I did this to stop a war.
[10:32.280 --> 10:37.320]  And so you better stop it right now. And that's why he did it. And so that's why they've
[10:37.320 --> 10:41.040]  now put a price on his head, because just like in the old days where you'd have two
[10:41.040 --> 10:44.960]  different champions, this happened in China, it happened in Japan, it happened in Asian
[10:44.960 --> 10:49.640]  Africa, it happened all over Europe, it happened in Mesoamerica, every culture will get sick
[10:49.640 --> 10:56.240]  of wars. So they start saying, hey, our champion will fight your champion. And instead of having
[10:56.240 --> 11:00.920]  a full war, whoever wins in that championship, that's where sports come from, the original
[11:00.920 --> 11:05.600]  sports were blood sports, will then be the winners. And that way, only one person dies
[11:05.600 --> 11:09.440]  or a few people die, in the case of the Aztecs with the ball playing court, but we don't
[11:09.440 --> 11:13.200]  kill thousands. And so I said on Friday, we'll play a clip in a moment on David Knight's
[11:13.200 --> 11:16.960]  show when he had a guest host, that this is like El Cid, where Trump just went in and
[11:16.960 --> 11:20.960]  killed the guy that's launching the operations against our troops as they try to pull out
[11:20.960 --> 11:25.200]  and who's trying to take over Iraq, saying, hey, we're not going to just kill your troops,
[11:25.200 --> 11:30.480]  we're going to kill you. So it's very gangster, it's very primitive, but it's actually how
[11:30.480 --> 11:36.440]  the world works. And so I said it's like El Cid. Well, I predicted it. Now they have
[11:36.440 --> 11:44.360]  put this giant price on Trump's head. So that's where we are. Trump is legitimately understanding
[11:44.360 --> 11:48.200]  what China is the big threat they're taking over the South China Sea. They're at war with
[11:48.200 --> 11:54.160]  Vietnam. They've been attacking them for several years, huge battles. There are also big threats
[11:54.160 --> 11:58.200]  out of the Philippines. If China keeps declaring that they control part of the Philippines.
[11:58.200 --> 12:01.520]  That's the big threat. That's who owns our debt. That's who owns Hollywood. That's who
[12:01.520 --> 12:06.200]  is censoring us with big tech. That's the big enchilada. And Trump gets it. He understands
[12:06.200 --> 12:11.040]  the pivot out. And America first means we still look out for our interests. America
[12:11.040 --> 12:15.840]  first means we don't turn and run. Because if we just turn and run, all these powerful
[12:15.840 --> 12:20.000]  interests are going to then invade their neighbors. So I don't want to be the policeman
[12:20.000 --> 12:24.200]  of the world. I want out of the Middle East. But again, if we run up white flags and turn
[12:24.200 --> 12:29.760]  and run and leave our weapons on the field, that will trigger larger wars for all of us
[12:29.760 --> 12:32.560]  that want peace. That is not a good thing.
[12:32.560 --> 12:36.320]  Well, it's like El Cid, which is a movie based on the true story. In the old days, those
[12:36.320 --> 12:39.960]  kingdoms would just have their champions fight. That's where gladiators actually started.
[12:39.960 --> 12:42.760]  It wasn't just out of entertainment. It was like two champions would fight instead of
[12:42.760 --> 12:47.520]  killing all your people. And so really, okay, you kill our people. We're going to kill you.
[12:47.520 --> 12:50.520]  And that's going to send a message that we're not going to just target your military. We're
[12:50.520 --> 12:53.240]  going to kill you. And I think the Mullahs are thinking twice.
[12:53.240 --> 12:57.480]  But now I want to take a moment to talk about in full wars and why the establishment hates
[12:57.480 --> 13:00.600]  us and why they're attacking us and why they're putting out fake news about us and why they're
[13:00.600 --> 13:05.160]  trying to shut us down. Because I don't get talking points from on high. I'm an independent
[13:05.160 --> 13:09.880]  individual who's real and who loves America and loves freedom and has good will in my
[13:09.880 --> 13:14.120]  heart for everybody. And so I saw some of the comments on info wars and some of the calls
[13:14.120 --> 13:18.960]  Friday saying, oh my gosh, Tucker Carlson is the anti-war guy now. Alex Jones is a neocon
[13:18.960 --> 13:26.320]  warmonger. We're also upset. Well, hey, I didn't call for this. I don't support war. Everybody
[13:26.320 --> 13:31.320]  knows that and that's not true. That's a cheap shot. And the idea that I'm doing this to
[13:31.320 --> 13:36.000]  like curry favor with the establishment, I'm being attacked because I've supported Trump.
[13:36.000 --> 13:39.520]  I'm being attacked because I support the Second Amendment. I'm being attacked because I support
[13:39.520 --> 13:45.880]  national sovereignty and Christianity and basic freedom. And so if I turned on Trump
[13:45.880 --> 13:51.200]  and attacked the Second Amendment and things like that, then you'd know I'd sold out.
[13:51.200 --> 13:55.080]  The establishment hates me because I'm real. It's making sure media undermining Trump
[13:55.080 --> 13:59.480]  on this strike and saying he's wrong and saying he's an idiot and hoping it goes wrong. And
[13:59.480 --> 14:05.680]  it is a gamble. So I did this. I broke this down on air and talked about all the different
[14:05.680 --> 14:10.520]  angles. It had Syrian girl on with one perspective and Steve Puchennecon from another perspective
[14:10.520 --> 14:16.160]  to have a real discussion. We don't get talking points from on high here and then go out and
[14:16.160 --> 14:21.400]  regurgitate those. Some of my hosts are for the strike. Some are against it. I don't call
[14:21.400 --> 14:26.480]  them up and say, Hey, you better agree with me. But by the way, what is my view? What
[14:26.480 --> 14:32.440]  is my policy? What is my idea? It's supporting getting out of the Middle East. And you saw
[14:32.440 --> 14:36.400]  what the Iraqi president came out today and said he's been in talks with Trump for months.
[14:36.400 --> 14:40.320]  He says Trump wants to pull out. The US was already quietly beginning to pull out. The
[14:40.320 --> 14:44.320]  Iranians knew it and we're getting ready to come into the vacuum and take over. And now
[14:44.320 --> 14:48.800]  Trump's going to use this to say, Hey, we took out the bad guy. You guys better not invade.
[14:48.800 --> 14:52.720]  We're pulling out. It's a win-win. And if Trump has his way, we're going to pull out
[14:52.720 --> 14:58.720]  of Iraq just like Syria, which again is anti-war and the reason I support Trump. So watch what
[14:58.720 --> 15:03.440]  happens. Ladies and gentlemen, this is 3D chess. I do support the president and I'm not crying
[15:03.440 --> 15:06.880]  that that very corrupt general that killed thousands of our troops over the last 20 years
[15:06.880 --> 15:11.280]  is dead. Does that mean I agree with all these wars? Absolutely not. I'm simply saying Iran
[15:11.280 --> 15:15.600]  is an expansionist group and people who are in love with the Mullahs are fools because
[15:15.600 --> 15:19.640]  they're unpopular with their own people. That doesn't mean I want regime change, but I can
[15:19.640 --> 15:24.440]  say that I don't worship the Shiite dictators. Okay? All right, Owen Stroyer is taken over
[15:24.440 --> 15:28.920]  live with all the latest developments. The Shiites are beginning to strike back and attack
[15:28.920 --> 15:33.160]  with rockets and attack bases. Let's pray for peace and hope this de-escalates. But the
[15:33.160 --> 15:36.360]  Iranians, I think, aren't going to be too rash. They're smart. And they now say it's
[15:36.360 --> 15:42.000]  fair game. They're going to try to kill President Trump. So Trump really valiantly, like el-Sid,
[15:42.000 --> 15:46.400]  has put himself in that place of the champion and says, if you want to get me, come and
[15:46.400 --> 15:50.800]  kill me. I'm going to kill your leaders, too, instead of our troops and their troops. Finally,
[15:50.800 --> 15:58.800]  a general leading from the front. I'm Alex Jones and this is the Info War.
[15:58.800 --> 16:02.520]  You want to break some globalist ribs. You want to crush some skulls politically. You
[16:02.520 --> 16:07.760]  want to drive ice picks through their eyeballs spiritually. There's nowhere you can spend
[16:07.760 --> 16:13.680]  money. There's nowhere you can place your bet in a fight where it's going to have more
[16:13.680 --> 16:19.800]  power per dollar. Your bang for your buck here gets you great products at great prices
[16:19.800 --> 16:25.400]  that literally fund the system where the spirit of resistance lives to drive it home to the
[16:25.400 --> 16:30.240]  enemy. And so it's very simple. If you don't want to be slaves and you want to see the
[16:30.240 --> 16:34.240]  fight taken to the enemy, which God wants to see, you see, we have to make the effort.
[16:34.240 --> 16:39.680]  110% God will finish the move. And I know I need to stay in the fight in the attack,
[16:39.680 --> 16:43.800]  attack, attack. I want to attack. I want to go after the globalists and just believe
[16:43.800 --> 16:46.480]  me, ladies and gentlemen, that if you want somebody to commit to you and your family
[16:46.480 --> 16:49.960]  to fight for all of our futures together, you've got to guarantee you keep me in the
[16:49.960 --> 16:54.640]  game. I'm going to bust my ass with everything I got for us, for myself and my family, for
[16:54.640 --> 16:59.240]  your family, because we're in this together. Infowarstore.com.
[16:59.240 --> 17:03.040]  It was about three and a half months ago and I said on air, I'm going to religiously
[17:03.040 --> 17:06.720]  take my supplements. I'd always taken them in the past, but I forget like everybody else
[17:06.720 --> 17:12.440]  to stay on the regiment. Well, I've done it and I've lost 39 pounds in less than four
[17:12.440 --> 17:17.240]  months and my life is so amazing. And I still have cake and ice cream and pie just like
[17:17.240 --> 17:23.320]  I did before. I'm exercising the same amount, but my body has the trace elements and the
[17:23.320 --> 17:28.960]  key things it needs like the clean iodine and X2 and X3. And I take a good energy booster
[17:28.960 --> 17:33.280]  like turbo force and brain force for my brain and I take the fish oil and I take the turmeric
[17:33.280 --> 17:37.040]  and I take the knockout and I use the good toothpaste fluoride free that's got the tea
[17:37.040 --> 17:42.680]  tree oil and so much more at infowarslife.com. 2020 is dawning. We have big sales total clearance

[17:52.360 --> 17:56.120]  more important than ever to keep info wars on the air and only you can do that by getting
[17:56.120 --> 18:01.480]  great products at infowarslife.com. I want to talk about super silver whitening toothpaste
[18:01.480 --> 18:06.600]  because I hadn't tried it except for maybe the last week and a half. And I told Alex
[18:06.600 --> 18:09.680]  I said, man, this is the best toothpaste I've ever tried. He's like, well, what are you
[18:09.680 --> 18:13.360]  doing just sitting in here telling me you got to get up there and tell people. So here
[18:13.360 --> 18:19.040]  I am telling people super silver whitening toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste I've
[18:19.040 --> 18:23.640]  ever tried. And I'm 45 years old and I've tried a lot of different toothpaste and it's
[18:23.640 --> 18:28.320]  fluoride free. I think the big difference the game changer in this is the coral calcium
[18:28.320 --> 18:33.280]  because after I brush my teeth with this, they feel so clean and the toothpaste that
[18:33.280 --> 18:38.000]  I don't even like rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this. It feels so good.
[18:38.000 --> 18:43.560]  It feels like it feels like good things are happening in my mouth. In fact, I find myself
[18:43.560 --> 18:48.600]  brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now because I
[18:48.600 --> 19:04.240]  like the way it feels. Knock on wood. I am not tempting fate. But everybody around the
[19:04.240 --> 19:09.760]  office, especially folks that have worked there a long time have noticed that I really
[19:09.760 --> 19:15.000]  don't ever get sick. Now again, I might get sick tomorrow because I just made that statement.
[19:15.000 --> 19:19.120]  I'm not tempting fate. I'll say that again because I am superstitious when it comes down
[19:19.120 --> 19:24.880]  to that. I'm very thankful for the good Lord, for the Constitution I've been given. But
[19:24.880 --> 19:30.120]  up until about eight, nine years ago when I started taking X2 and the products, then
[19:30.120 --> 19:35.480]  for life, I still got sick every couple of years. And you know, I still get sore throats
[19:35.480 --> 19:41.560]  from allergies and pollen and things like that. But now that I religiously take the
[19:41.560 --> 19:46.120]  products and then for life, the highest quality supplements you're going to find out there,
[19:46.120 --> 19:54.800]  I just never get a fever anymore. It's probably been three, four years since I've had a fever.
[19:54.800 --> 20:01.600]  It's just crazy. So I chalk it up to genetics and the great products.
[20:01.600 --> 20:22.920]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:22.920 --> 20:30.240]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic. It's Alex Jones. And now your
[20:30.240 --> 20:50.120]  host, Owen Troyer. There have been a lot of developments in the past 48 hours since the
[20:50.120 --> 21:02.800]  strike in Iran. Multiple strikes in Iran that have everybody talking about World War Three
[21:02.800 --> 21:13.480]  all of a sudden. And I realized something. Just like everything else that's been done
[21:13.480 --> 21:22.280]  in the Middle East and with the war on terror, this World War Three narrative is just as
[21:22.280 --> 21:25.880]  contrived. Now that's not to say that the threat isn't real. That's not to say that
[21:25.880 --> 21:31.080]  people's fears aren't real. It's just, you notice that this has never happened before
[21:31.080 --> 21:39.680]  in such a wave of public awareness. That's because now it's being forced to trend on
[21:39.680 --> 21:44.160]  Twitter. Now everybody is talking about it on the news. It used to be nobody would use
[21:44.160 --> 21:53.240]  that rhetoric, but now they're all willing to use it because they want Trump to be synonymous
[21:53.240 --> 22:00.320]  with World War Three. And so if you take a step back and look at everything that's happened
[22:00.320 --> 22:10.120]  since Trump was elected, this is just another example of them blaming Trump, whether it
[22:10.120 --> 22:16.800]  be the Democrats, old guard Republicans, the DC establishment, the media, all of them blaming
[22:16.800 --> 22:28.400]  Trump for what they did. They were the ones that spread fake news to start multiple wars.
[22:28.400 --> 22:31.840]  Only in the Middle East. They were the ones that funded proxy armies. They were the ones
[22:31.840 --> 22:36.360]  that dumped weapons over there. They were the ones that were arming terrorists and rebels
[22:36.360 --> 22:47.840]  and governments. And it's all been going on for decades. And it gets handed to Trump.
[22:47.840 --> 22:57.520]  It's a mess. It's a disaster. It's war. And he is probably trying to do what he thinks
[22:57.520 --> 23:06.440]  is best to try to clear it up. Now, again, it becomes a purist issue, a polarized issue
[23:06.440 --> 23:10.960]  where either you're for strikes or against strikes, which means you're either for war
[23:10.960 --> 23:19.240]  or against war. Well, I think it's more complex than that. But let's just look at everything
[23:19.240 --> 23:27.320]  that's developed. And again, you notice for the first time ever, all of these trending
[23:27.320 --> 23:31.520]  hashtags and stuff about World War III and war in the Middle East and us being against
[23:31.520 --> 23:36.680]  it with the media promoting it that way, that's all new. Why? Because it's all meant to make
[23:36.680 --> 23:43.360]  Trump look bad. So just like Russian collusion, wasn't Trump, it was the deep state with Hillary
[23:43.360 --> 23:49.120]  and John McCain. Just like election meddling, wasn't Trump or Russia, that's been the Democrats
[23:49.120 --> 23:56.440]  for decades in the deep state, illegal immigration, etc. Just like quid pro quo with Ukraine.
[23:56.440 --> 24:02.400]  That wasn't Trump. That was Joe Biden during the Obama administration. The list goes on
[24:02.400 --> 24:11.880]  and on. World War III is now that next addition to the list. And is this finally where it
[24:11.880 --> 24:19.000]  reaches the end of the plateau? Is there anywhere else they can go? Does it get any worse than
[24:19.000 --> 24:23.760]  or just like the Me Too movement? Point the finger at Trump? No, it was Bill Clinton. No,
[24:23.760 --> 24:30.760]  it was Hollywood. And so now they want to blame Trump for World War III. No, that was
[24:30.760 --> 24:34.840]  the Obama administration. No, that was the Bush administration. No, that was the Clinton
[24:34.840 --> 24:46.960]  administration. But you see, they now want World War III so that they can blame Donald
[24:46.960 --> 24:55.480]  Trump. You see how that works? And it really is sickening. It really is sickening what
[24:55.480 --> 25:02.360]  you see happening from former Obama administration officials and members of the media where
[25:02.360 --> 25:07.080]  if this was considered an official war with Iran, if we were actually considered war with
[25:07.080 --> 25:19.840]  Iran, CNN would be shut down, seized, raided, and they'd all be arrested. Think about that.
[25:19.840 --> 25:28.400]  But let's just look at some of these developments. Iran vows to hit 35 U.S. targets and unfurls
[25:28.400 --> 25:37.520]  red flag of war. Iran raises red flag of jihad over dome of its holiest city signaling revenge
[25:37.520 --> 25:45.920]  for Soleimani death. Iran threatens to attack White House in crushing retaliation. Iran
[25:45.920 --> 25:49.600]  regime offers 80 million for President Trump's head, which isn't that kind of like an Austin
[25:49.600 --> 26:03.440]  powers moment, like $1 million. $1 million isn't that much anymore. It's like $80 million.
[26:03.440 --> 26:09.280]  For Trump's head, you wonder how serious they really are. Trump retaliates as 52 Iranian
[26:09.280 --> 26:18.080]  targets lined up if there's retaliation. And then in some other developments, Netanyahu
[26:18.080 --> 26:24.280]  in alleged stumble says Israel is a nuclear power. Well, was he saying Israel has nuclear
[26:24.280 --> 26:29.360]  weapons? Is he just saying that the United States is the United States Army and our
[26:29.360 --> 26:34.520]  capabilities are in his command? What is he really saying there? Or did he just lie? Royal
[26:34.520 --> 26:40.320]  Navy deployed to protect British ships in Gulf in wake of Soleimani's assassination.
[26:40.320 --> 26:45.760]  So yeah, the Strait of Armuz, the Gulf, everybody's on edge. Thousands chant death to America
[26:45.760 --> 26:52.800]  at funeral to top Iranian general Soleimani. We're being told that also all of these protests
[26:52.800 --> 26:57.320]  out there, basically it's like a same thing that they do here. They give you, you know,
[26:57.320 --> 27:04.500]  breakfast, lunch and dinner and just come out and protest. And then Iraqi parliament
[27:04.500 --> 27:11.520]  passes resolution to end foreign troop presence in Iraq. Now, I think it would be smart and
[27:11.520 --> 27:15.480]  I would like to see Trump pull out of the Middle East right now, specifically Iraq and
[27:15.480 --> 27:19.520]  Iran. Just get out, declare a victory. All right, you killed the top general. You killed
[27:19.520 --> 27:27.880]  some others. Pull out. Get out of there. It'd be a huge political victory. Now, here's
[27:27.880 --> 27:33.320]  the question that we ask ourselves. Obviously, us going to war with Iran or Iraq does not
[27:33.320 --> 27:40.660]  benefit you or I in the short term or the long term. And you have all kinds of headlines
[27:40.660 --> 27:46.400]  and protests. Outraged Americans condemn US actions in Iraq and Iran. Enough of this nonsense.
[27:46.400 --> 27:50.440]  You have the left drumming up protests, funding them. They have their whole thing on a string,
[27:50.440 --> 27:54.920]  folks. They can just literally hit a button and they can have protests nationwide. More
[27:54.920 --> 28:00.880]  than 70 protests planned across US against Soleimani strike. Well, forget Soleimani.
[28:00.880 --> 28:04.200]  I mean, that's just the name. That's just the face. That's just the narrative. What's
[28:04.200 --> 28:09.120]  really going on here is that the average American is sick of being at war in the Middle East.
[28:09.120 --> 28:13.680]  The average American has no interest in Iran or Iraq. The average American doesn't care.
[28:13.680 --> 28:24.240]  So who does? Ah, ah, because you see Donald Trump, the president of the United States,
[28:24.240 --> 28:30.280]  has to consider that too. And I'm not saying that's good, folks, but the reality is it's
[28:30.280 --> 28:35.080]  not just what's best for the American people and that's what we're sick of. And that's
[28:35.080 --> 28:38.840]  why we don't want to see foreign wars anymore. Why we're sick of the foreign intervention
[28:38.840 --> 28:42.880]  and that's why it's time to bring the troops home. But now it doesn't look like that's
[28:42.880 --> 28:50.480]  happening anytime soon. I think we're all frustrated with that. More coming up on the
[28:50.480 --> 28:54.960]  other side, more developments again. If we were at war with Iran, CNN would be committing
[28:54.960 --> 28:58.720]  blatant treason.
[28:58.720 --> 29:02.840]  Just during the break, I went and got a delicious cup, a second cup of the day. It's really
[29:02.840 --> 29:06.880]  strong. I shouldn't do this because all work and no playmates jack a really aggressive
[29:06.880 --> 29:11.200]  boy and the coffee has to wake up America coffee there by loves highest rated in the
[29:11.200 --> 29:14.800]  shop of some mountains. It's beyond Mexican coffee beyond Guatemalan coffee. It's the best

[29:53.680 --> 30:00.800]  It's not as popular. Anyways, it's all at infowarstore.com. I keep my eye on the news
[30:00.800 --> 30:06.960]  all the time, but I miss the fact that in late 2019, just about two weeks ago,
[30:06.960 --> 30:16.960]  the CDC and the FDA approved live Ebola vaccine to be given inside the United States. And it
[30:16.960 --> 30:24.480]  is an experimental vaccine. It is live. It's not even attenuated. They've just genetically
[30:24.480 --> 30:30.480]  modified it. So it's supposedly not lethal. Same stuff they did with the Gardasil vaccine
[30:30.480 --> 30:36.320]  that's admittedly killed and named so many. This is just crazy. And the Congos had the
[30:36.320 --> 30:41.840]  biggest outbreaks of Ebola ever since they started giving the vaccine there in the last few years.
[30:41.840 --> 30:47.200]  Oh, and of course, open the borders up here and letting people in unvetted the Democrats
[30:47.200 --> 30:53.040]  distribute across the country. You cannot make up the magnitude of this insanity. And it is
[30:53.040 --> 31:03.120]  an attempted Ebola assault on America. This is the New World Order. Please remember,
[31:03.120 --> 31:06.960]  without your financial support, we're not here. We've been demonized, sued, attacked by the
[31:06.960 --> 31:10.800]  globalist. That's fine. You're supporting us. We're overcoming it. We're still on air. We're
[31:10.800 --> 31:14.880]  expanding in some ways. Thanks to you. The year in sale is extended for three more days,
[31:14.880 --> 31:19.600]  worldwide free shipping, double patriot points up to 70% off and a bunch of stuff just sold out
[31:19.600 --> 31:23.200]  and a bunch of stuff's about to sell out. So a lot of the sale is already ending with more than
[31:23.200 --> 31:26.960]  20 items, more than 40 items are still on sale. But that's how you find the operation. Plus,
[31:26.960 --> 31:30.320]  they're great products. Get your wake up America coffee experience with the best coffee out there

[31:47.440 --> 31:51.280]  amendment in the face of the globalist. I'm Alex Jones and this is 2020.
[32:17.440 --> 32:23.040]  Or we develop our own with top developers and folks, I'm telling you, you can see the difference
[32:23.040 --> 32:28.640]  in me, my energy, my focus. I've lost almost 40 pounds in less than four months. It's incredible.
[32:28.640 --> 32:34.160]  So do yourself a favor. Try out the products if you've been on the fence. You can't lose
[32:34.160 --> 32:38.400]  except if you don't take action because when you buy the products, you're funding the operation
[32:38.400 --> 32:44.080]  that is always delivering thanks to your support and God's grace and our action. But you need these
[32:44.080 --> 32:47.920]  products. That's the real reason you want to get them is because they're amazing. And then when
[32:47.920 --> 32:53.280]  you get great results, please tell others about it word of mouth. That's how we expand in the face
[32:53.280 --> 33:22.080]  of the NWO instead of imploding. We're fighting to win and we are winning. Thanks to you.
[33:23.280 --> 33:38.880]  It really just comes down to this to me in these difficult times. And I've said this before,
[33:38.880 --> 33:46.480]  this covering trying to cover wars and military action and stuff as it's developing is maybe the
[33:46.480 --> 33:54.160]  second least fun thing to do here on air outside of covering mass shooting when it's happening
[33:54.160 --> 33:58.080]  live. It's the toughest thing to cover. People want answers. They want understanding. And sometimes
[33:58.080 --> 34:03.520]  it takes time. And because of the way media works and the landscape escape here, everybody
[34:04.560 --> 34:12.400]  wants to be on the leading edge. But you know, here's what it boils down to for me because
[34:12.400 --> 34:18.640]  you're never going to please everybody. Trump's never going to please everybody. To sit here and
[34:18.640 --> 34:25.360]  blame Trump for what's going on in the Middle East is so disingenuous and unfair. And the media knows
[34:25.360 --> 34:31.920]  it. And all these former Obama administration officials know it. Congress knows it. They do
[34:31.920 --> 34:36.640]  it anyway because they hate Trump. They never held Obama's heat to the fire. Now Bush used to take
[34:36.640 --> 34:44.560]  heat. Obama was just like Bush. He just didn't quote unquote start the wars. But I will say this,
[34:44.560 --> 34:53.840]  Trump could finish him if he wants to. But that's on President Donald Trump. So yeah, I'm against
[34:53.840 --> 34:59.120]  foreign intervention. I'm against striking. I'm against military action. I'd like all the troops
[34:59.120 --> 35:14.400]  to come home. But if I don't get that and Trump further alongs or progresses further or regresses,
[35:14.400 --> 35:21.600]  I mean, people are debating what's happening in the Middle East. Well, I'm not going to sit here
[35:21.600 --> 35:32.400]  and say it's all Trump's fault. He inherited a disaster. And there is a larger geopolitical game
[35:32.400 --> 35:40.320]  of chess going on right now. And so for the media and the Democrats to sit here and focus on this
[35:40.320 --> 35:46.240]  strike of Soleimani and say, wow, look, Trump starting World War three again, that's disingenuous,
[35:46.240 --> 35:57.040]  that is dishonest, and that is not fair. So if Trump furthers us into more conflict and intervention
[35:57.040 --> 36:03.600]  in the Middle East, yeah, I'm against that. I don't want to see that. And so far, it really
[36:03.600 --> 36:08.400]  hasn't been that bad. Again, Obama was much worse than Trump when it comes to action military
[36:08.400 --> 36:19.040]  action in the Middle East. When Trump does something, you know what it is. And you know why.
[36:19.040 --> 36:23.360]  So again, though, Trump could have the biggest political victory by declaring victory right
[36:23.360 --> 36:26.080]  now and pulling the troops home. Now, I don't expect that to happen.
[36:29.440 --> 36:32.880]  Even though that's what the American people want. And this is again, where we get so frustrated
[36:32.880 --> 36:40.480]  because we know who really runs DC, don't we? And it's not us. And that's why some Trump supporters
[36:40.480 --> 36:47.280]  are frustrated right now. But look at what's going on in the media where Susan Rice stories
[36:47.280 --> 36:59.280]  at info wars.com is on face the nation. Or I'm sorry, this is on CNN. Excuse me. Wow. So CNN is
[36:59.280 --> 37:03.600]  even worse than I thought. I mean, seriously, CNN, I just can't even imagine working for such a
[37:03.600 --> 37:08.880]  traitorous network. And if we were officially at war with Iran, the military would probably be
[37:08.880 --> 37:17.520]  taking action at CNN. But but this is what I'm saying. This is how Susan Rice, who's smart
[37:17.520 --> 37:26.800]  enough to try to play both angles here, she says this on CNN. I am doubtful. It will prove to be
[37:26.800 --> 37:32.880]  the right thing. Soleimani strike. In the first instance, any of us familiar with Soleimani
[37:32.880 --> 37:37.840]  and the extraordinary blood on his hands has to be happy to see him off the battlefield.
[37:37.840 --> 37:42.080]  He's a murderer and a terrorist of the first order. Wow. That's from Susan Rice.
[37:43.280 --> 37:47.280]  So you see, even they know he was a terrorist, even they labeled him a terrorist.
[37:49.440 --> 37:53.520]  But then she says having said that, whether we and Americans around the world are safer as a
[37:53.520 --> 37:57.440]  result of his targeted assassination, even though she just said having him off the battlefield is a
[37:57.440 --> 38:06.720]  good thing, they would have been had we pursued other means to deal with what was purportedly
[38:06.720 --> 38:11.280]  the imminent threat at hand. I'm not sure about that. I am not sure as I look at this,
[38:11.280 --> 38:15.600]  there are other ways to deescalate the situation. Oh, like giving them hundreds of billions of
[38:15.600 --> 38:27.600]  dollars like Obama did. Yeah, that. Oh, good call. The UN is saying the US broke international
[38:27.600 --> 38:33.520]  law by eliminating Soleimani. But again, he's already listed as a terrorist. He's already
[38:33.520 --> 38:38.960]  listed as a murderer. He already has thousands of deaths to his name, but he's protected
[38:38.960 --> 38:48.160]  and trumps the bad guy. And the times of London, or now they get triggered when you say this,
[38:48.160 --> 38:56.000]  so I say it more often, London stand times of London stand named the Iranian general to a list
[38:56.000 --> 39:09.280]  of rising stars in 2020. How do you like that? Now, what are the odds of that really? I mean,
[39:11.440 --> 39:23.040]  what are the odds of that really? I wonder CNN gives softball interview to Iran's PR encourages
[39:23.040 --> 39:31.920]  Trump bashing rhetoric. CNN is pro Iran anti American. And then just to illustrate what
[39:31.920 --> 39:37.440]  a quagmire at all is and how again, they've all been lying. All of them. They all lied before
[39:37.440 --> 39:41.360]  Trump got in before Trump even ran for office. They were all bombing the Middle East. They were
[39:41.360 --> 39:46.400]  all doing it for all kinds of different reasons. And they and they became so
[39:48.560 --> 39:52.240]  confident in their lives that they didn't even care what they lied about anymore,
[39:52.240 --> 40:00.080]  because they never get checked on it. And so now Biden caught in flat out lie over bin Laden raid
[40:00.640 --> 40:07.040]  stories at zero hedge. But basically he's he's given about five different accounts of what happened
[40:07.040 --> 40:12.160]  between him and Obama at the bin Laden raid. First he was against it, then he was for it,
[40:12.160 --> 40:15.600]  then against it. Now he's tripled down saying he was for it. People call him out saying,
[40:15.600 --> 40:19.680]  no, here's the quote. You said you were against it. And then he freaks out because they don't
[40:19.680 --> 40:24.400]  even know folks. They don't even know the story. They don't even try to be honest or truthful.
[40:24.400 --> 40:28.400]  They don't care. They know the media will never check them. They know Hollywood's in their
[40:28.400 --> 40:33.520]  pocket. The media is in their pocket. Everything's in their pocket. Now Trump doesn't have that luxury.
[40:36.080 --> 40:41.840]  Trump can't do anything good. And so if Obama let me put it to you this way.
[40:43.120 --> 40:49.200]  If Obama would have had a military strike that killed Soleimani, he'd be a hero.
[40:49.200 --> 40:53.840]  The media would be holding him up as a hero. Hollywood would be holding him up as a hero.
[40:53.840 --> 40:57.680]  He'd probably get a Nobel Peace Prize. He'd probably host the Golden Globes.
[40:58.720 --> 41:04.560]  It'd be the ultimate hero. He'd be number one. And of course Soleimani would be the bad guy,
[41:04.560 --> 41:08.080]  the terrorist. And they'd mention all the Americans he's killed and all the blood on his
[41:08.080 --> 41:11.760]  hands. And he's this and he's that. He's a terrorist and everything. And he, okay.
[41:12.400 --> 41:16.240]  But you see Trump does it. Now all of a sudden Trump bad, Trump's the bad guy.
[41:16.240 --> 41:22.480]  Soleimani was a king. He was a hero, a sphere religious leader. And then ironically enough,
[41:22.480 --> 41:27.920]  Soleimani actually means man of peace. Originating from Soleimani, translator over the years,
[41:27.920 --> 41:36.880]  Soleimani, man of peace. But that just shows you how the media is skewed, how politics is skewed,
[41:36.880 --> 41:42.560]  how DC is skewed. Trump has a different set of rules. So again, I'm not in support of airstrikes.
[41:42.560 --> 41:47.040]  I don't want to see further intervention. I want all the troops home. But I'm not going to sit here
[41:47.040 --> 41:52.320]  and point the finger at Trump when he's got everything stacked against him, everything
[41:52.320 --> 41:57.120]  weighed against him. This whole quagmire he inherited. And in comparison, you look at the
[41:57.120 --> 42:01.760]  military action he's taken versus what's happened in the past. Yeah, he's like
[42:03.040 --> 42:08.640]  one one hundredth as bad as a Bush administration or an Obama administration, maybe less. And at
[42:08.640 --> 42:12.960]  least with him, you know what you're getting. And you know where and you know when and you know why.
[42:13.520 --> 42:17.520]  We've never had that luxury before. But you're so you because of all that, Trump's bad now,
[42:17.520 --> 42:23.200]  you see. So he gets blamed for everything. But it's just like everything else. They colluded
[42:23.200 --> 42:29.360]  with Russia. They meddled in the election. They're the ones attacking free speech. They're the threats
[42:29.360 --> 42:36.000]  to America. They're the ones responsible for the Me Too movement. They're the ones responsible for
[42:36.000 --> 42:42.160]  World War Three. They're the ones that have initiated all of this in the Middle East, not Trump. So
[42:42.160 --> 42:48.240]  this is just another case and maybe the final case of blame Trump for what we did. If you're
[42:48.240 --> 42:52.880]  Obama, if you're Bush, if you're the deep state establishment politics, the establishment media,
[42:52.880 --> 42:56.800]  they blame Trump for everything they did. No, World War Three will be on your hands, CNN.
[42:56.800 --> 43:07.200]  As I drive in to the Central Texas Information Warfare Command Center in Austin, Texas, it is
[43:07.200 --> 43:16.080]  January 2nd, 2020. And you only have four days left as of me taping this to take advantage of

[44:59.040 --> 45:02.960]  I want to talk about super silver whitening toothpaste because I hadn't tried it,
[45:02.960 --> 45:07.440]  except for maybe the last week and a half. And I told Alex, I said, man, this is the best
[45:07.440 --> 45:10.800]  toothpaste I've ever tried. He's like, well, what are you doing? Just sitting in here telling me,
[45:10.800 --> 45:16.880]  you got to get up there and tell me. So here I am telling people super silver whitening toothpaste
[45:16.880 --> 45:22.160]  is by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried. And I'm 45 years old and I've tried a lot of
[45:22.160 --> 45:27.200]  different toothpaste and it's fluoride free. I think the big difference the game changer in
[45:27.200 --> 45:32.400]  this is the coral calcium because after I brush my teeth with this, they feel so clean and the
[45:32.400 --> 45:37.040]  toothpaste that I don't even like rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this. It feels
[45:37.040 --> 45:43.600]  so good. It feels like it feels like good things are happening in my mouth. In fact, I find myself
[45:43.600 --> 45:49.360]  brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now because I like the way
[45:49.360 --> 46:03.040]  it feels. I would thank you for everything you've done for the info war, but I know you're like
[46:03.040 --> 46:07.920]  me. You don't want my thanks. You want victory over the globalist and these devil worship and
[46:07.920 --> 46:12.320]  child molesters and you want them off your back and off your children's back. You know what?
[46:12.320 --> 46:17.520]  I'm the same way and that's why we're on the same damn team and it's why M4s has been delivering
[46:17.520 --> 46:24.000]  time and time again when it's clutch time to focus the people on taking action against the
[46:24.000 --> 46:30.800]  globalist because I'm committed to a future for humanity and I know you are as well. So thank
[46:30.800 --> 46:35.680]  you in 2019 for standing with us because you are the info war and I want to thank you for committing
[46:35.680 --> 46:40.720]  to stand with us in 2020 however you can. For the bottom of my heart, for my family, and for the
[46:40.720 --> 46:45.680]  great crew at info wars, I want to thank you all because you are the info war and you know that's
[46:45.680 --> 46:53.120]  not just words, that's reality. You have made history. We have made history together. infowars.com
[46:53.120 --> 47:04.320]  only has power because of you and I suggest you use it you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[47:04.320 --> 47:27.840]  big brother mainstream media government coverups you want to stop tyranny well so does he live
[47:27.840 --> 47:35.360]  from the info wars.com studios it's alex jones and now your host owin shroyer
[47:43.600 --> 47:50.960]  the power of the dark side what is the real power of the dark side
[47:50.960 --> 48:03.680]  it's destroying americans iqs lowering their consciousness cutting off their connection
[48:03.680 --> 48:15.040]  with god and humanity weakening their confidence weakening their instincts and then training them
[48:15.040 --> 48:24.480]  with lights and propaganda literally lights on a screen to flickerate images training them to
[48:24.480 --> 48:34.560]  believe your propaganda then dominating all the main factors of communication and messaging
[48:34.560 --> 48:44.640]  hollywood entertainment mainstream news dc politics so that then you have a controllable mass
[48:44.640 --> 48:50.160]  of people that won't question anything won't look behind and around the corner or the curtain
[48:51.440 --> 48:53.680]  and will literally believe anything that they're fed
[49:01.120 --> 49:12.800]  and when there's no real heroes anymore you can replace the likeness of a hero the concept of a hero
[49:12.800 --> 49:24.560]  that idea with a scarecrow with a strawman
[49:28.480 --> 49:36.880]  with a false icon and then you control those false icons and you control those masses and
[49:36.880 --> 49:43.680]  that's where we're at and the trump phenomenon is the line where do you stand now this doesn't mean
[49:43.680 --> 49:49.920]  you they're like everything trump does or don't like anything trump does it means you recognize
[49:49.920 --> 49:57.120]  the paradigm of the dc establishment the hollywood establishment the media establishment and the
[49:57.120 --> 50:04.960]  confluence of all three to deceive you misinform you and they've been doing it for decades that's
[50:04.960 --> 50:08.800]  the very power structure that opposes trump that's the very power structure that we're opposing
[50:11.760 --> 50:18.480]  but when you have the brainwashed masses believing anything you put out it becomes an upward battle
[50:20.640 --> 50:27.680]  and a spiritual battle the likes of which we were never even meant to win
[50:27.680 --> 50:34.400]  but the victory is in the fight now i got plenty of more news to get to here
[50:35.040 --> 50:39.040]  and i'm going to get to all of it but i want to open up the phone lines here because i want to get

[51:57.360 --> 52:04.400]  a lot of overcast and rain and you know typically here in austin what winter means is not necessarily
[52:04.400 --> 52:10.320]  cold weather i mean sometimes it gets a little cold but it does mean dreary weather and overcast
[52:10.320 --> 52:17.840]  and cloudy and no sun and so in the winter i make sure i focus on getting my vitamin d
[52:18.400 --> 52:24.800]  and winter sun plus from in from infowarestore.com is the best vitamin d supplement that i've come

[53:44.560 --> 53:52.160]  going to believe in the next segment and then your phone calls in the next hour the deep state
[53:52.160 --> 53:58.640]  battle here internally against trump rages on trump administration subpoena case gets mixed

[54:27.280 --> 54:31.920]  what's really going on here it's kind of like the whole story about solomony being on the time of
[54:31.920 --> 54:41.840]  times of london 2020 what was the exact rising stars list if you can believe that here it is
[54:41.840 --> 54:49.120]  here it is sit in fours dot com times of london names iranian general to list of 2020 rising stars
[54:49.120 --> 54:52.960]  day before assassination now you can either believe in that coincidence or you can think
[54:54.080 --> 54:57.360]  maybe someone leaked that he was going to be assassinated and they figured hey let's make
[54:57.360 --> 55:01.280]  him a rising star and then when he gets killed you know we'll say oh trump bad he killed a hero
[55:02.400 --> 55:08.640]  maybe it's just coincidence but let me explain what this is a headline for matthew daily in the
[55:08.640 --> 55:14.880]  associated press syndicated goes on pbs other websites small cracks have appeared in g.o.p.
[55:14.880 --> 55:19.360]  unity on impeachment trial what is this really folks this is what you call bait
[55:21.440 --> 55:26.480]  so they write up stories and headlines they've been doing this for two years we've been explaining
[55:26.480 --> 55:36.000]  it here info wars dot com to create a self-fulfilling prophecy there's not really a small cracks
[55:36.000 --> 55:44.560]  in impeachment trial there's news reports there's rhetoric there's gossip but what they do is they
[55:44.560 --> 55:48.720]  write these stories they write these headlines they put out these press releases they put the
[55:48.720 --> 55:54.480]  bottom lines on these news networks saying oh republican split oh cracks and g.o.p. unity on
[55:54.480 --> 56:01.600]  impeachment oh it's looking bad to create a self-fulfilling prophecy so then republicans see this and
[56:01.600 --> 56:05.120]  they think and then you know this has been like licking their finger to put their hand in the wind
[56:05.120 --> 56:10.320]  see which way it's blowing or how hard it's blowing and they say oh my oh oh i don't want to look bad
[56:10.320 --> 56:14.880]  oh there's cracks in the union impeachment oh oh maybe i should consider impeachment now
[56:15.840 --> 56:20.320]  because they're more afraid of the media than their own constituents they're more afraid of the
[56:20.320 --> 56:29.520]  media than they are american citizens so that's what that is so if you see this narrative start to
[56:29.520 --> 56:37.760]  play out they're just trying to intimidate republicans and put a wedge in republicans on the unity
[56:37.760 --> 56:44.480]  and impeachment it's a self-fulfilling prophecy you create the headline to then create the scenario
[56:45.680 --> 56:54.000]  you put into the headline meanwhile though donald trump's immigration judges boost deportation
[56:54.000 --> 57:02.960]  numbers they're actually rejecting asylum seekers now they're actually busing asylum seekers back
[57:02.960 --> 57:10.640]  to mexico now obama is still beating trump in deportation numbers i suggest trump changed that
[57:10.640 --> 57:16.400]  before 2020 in fact i see again this is where it comes in that people are so afraid of the
[57:16.400 --> 57:19.920]  media not trump but he has people inside of his campaign that say oh don't do this they'll bash
[57:19.920 --> 57:25.600]  you for it gotta quit being afraid of the media donald trump should deport more illegal immigrants
[57:25.600 --> 57:31.280]  in the year 2020 than any other year in american history run on that as a campaign promise delivered
[57:31.280 --> 57:35.280]  and it'll be total victory but people inside of his campaign say oh don't do that you'll be called
[57:35.280 --> 57:40.560]  racist oh they'll spin it no it's time to double down triple down and start deporting illegal
[57:40.560 --> 57:46.000]  immigrants and using that to declare victory see that republicans hate declaring victory they hate
[57:46.000 --> 57:51.360]  having victory they like remaining neutral it was about three and a half months ago and i said on
[57:51.360 --> 57:55.760]  air i'm going to religiously take my supplements i'd always taken them in the past but i forget
[57:55.760 --> 58:01.840]  like everybody else to stay on the regiment well i've done it and i've lost 39 pounds in less than
[58:01.840 --> 58:07.360]  four months and my life is so amazing and i still have cake and ice cream and pie just like i did
[58:07.360 --> 58:14.400]  before i'm exercising the same amount but my body has the trace elements and the key things it needs
[58:14.400 --> 58:20.160]  like the clean iodine and x2 and x3 and i take a good energy booster like turbo force and brain
[58:20.160 --> 58:24.480]  force for my brain and i take the fish oil and i take the turmeric and i take the knock out and
[58:24.480 --> 58:28.080]  i use the good toothpaste it's fluoride free that's got the tea tree oil and so much more

[58:56.160 --> 59:06.800]  ago the cdc and the fda approved live ebola vaccine to be given inside the united states and
[59:06.800 --> 59:14.480]  it is an experimental vaccine it is live it's not even attenuated they've just genetically
[59:14.480 --> 59:20.720]  modified it so it's supposedly non-lethal same stuff they did with the Gardasil vaccine that's
[59:20.720 --> 59:27.120]  admittedly killed in name so many this is just crazy and the congos had the biggest outbreaks
[59:27.120 --> 59:32.240]  of ebola ever since they started giving the vaccine there in the last few years oh and of
[59:32.240 --> 59:37.760]  course opening the borders up here and letting people in unfettered the democrats distribute
[59:37.760 --> 59:44.240]  across the country you cannot make up the magnitude of this insanity and it is an attempted ebola
[59:44.240 --> 1:00:06.240]  assault on america this is the new world order you're listening to the alex jones show

[1:01:11.280 --> 1:01:15.600]  that because they protect the democrat party adam schiff should have been removed from office
[1:01:15.600 --> 1:01:21.680]  after that and censured uh but of course he's a protected democrat the media never mentioned that
[1:01:21.680 --> 1:01:27.680]  well it's now happened to good old maxine waters if adam schiff isn't the dumbest member of congress

[1:08:36.960 --> 1:08:42.880]  we're three witnesses we used to be followed by the iranian air force on our twitter account
[1:08:42.880 --> 1:08:50.320]  bubba scout rev and they told us they'll overthrow that regime they gave the coordinates to that
[1:08:50.320 --> 1:08:57.440]  airstrike last week to get rid of that asshole all right we got to dump that we got to dump that
[1:08:57.440 --> 1:09:02.640]  we can't have cursing sorry bubba appreciate the call uh but we have to dump you when you curse uh
[1:09:02.640 --> 1:09:06.480]  because uh we can't have that over terrestrial radio look there's a lot of stuff happening in
[1:09:06.480 --> 1:09:10.240]  iran a lot of stuff going unreported there's people in iran that want to see regime change
[1:09:10.240 --> 1:09:16.320]  there's obviously people that not there's other sort of revolutions or uprisings happening like
[1:09:16.320 --> 1:09:21.760]  white wednesday and the restart so there's all crazy there's a bunch of crazy stuff i mean 2020
[1:09:21.760 --> 1:09:27.200]  is really kicked off with a bang i mean it's unbelievable to think like i mean how does man
[1:09:27.200 --> 1:09:32.240]  make a calendar and it just so happens when we flip to a new decade and four days in it's already
[1:09:32.240 --> 1:09:40.960]  like the whole world has changed uh let's go to richard and texas go ahead richard uh hey on
[1:09:42.400 --> 1:09:47.920]  i i never plug i've actually never plugged once i talk to you guys all the time but just
[1:09:48.960 --> 1:09:55.360]  the listeners grow up and buy some stuff uh it's extremely important and if you're doubting my
[1:09:55.360 --> 1:09:59.600]  words then listen to the john bowen report that was played at the beginning of this broadcast
[1:09:59.600 --> 1:10:04.960]  listen to the alex jones show on friday that was some of the top information i've ever
[1:10:04.960 --> 1:10:12.080]  heard in my entire life and to hear people attacking both you and alex uh on friday was
[1:10:12.080 --> 1:10:18.400]  extremely concerning mainly because it wasn't legitimate criticism it was just kind of off-handed
[1:10:18.400 --> 1:10:25.440]  nonsense but what i wanted to ask is that you'd have ron paul on because rt is having ron paul on
[1:10:25.440 --> 1:10:32.080]  to basically try and turn him against trump and i know alex has at least some relationship with
[1:10:32.080 --> 1:10:37.680]  ron paul so if there's any way you could get him on i would really appreciate that and then
[1:10:39.280 --> 1:10:47.360]  the thing i talked about with you the other day is about um solomani and elbag daddy being
[1:10:47.360 --> 1:10:54.080]  clapper and brennan's largest highest investment programs and i made a comment that q is fake after
[1:10:54.080 --> 1:11:02.000]  that and i didn't explain why and the way politics works is trump isn't i mean i think he should go
[1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:08.080]  after them going to jail but what he's doing he's trying to destroy their legacy and if whether
[1:11:08.080 --> 1:11:14.560]  that's right or wrong that's another issue but he's doing the best he can to stop yeah and you
[1:11:14.560 --> 1:11:19.760]  know what let me let me kind of just let me kind of just rephrase that and get your brief response
[1:11:19.760 --> 1:11:24.640]  it's the same thing trump is fighting the same war whether it's here or in iraq or iran it's
[1:11:24.640 --> 1:11:29.760]  against the globalist it's against the deep state they're the ones that set up all of these factions
[1:11:29.760 --> 1:11:34.960]  again i don't want strikes i want the us out of that region but to sit here and act like trump
[1:11:35.680 --> 1:11:41.360]  is going out of his powers or or a frame of powers here and and assassinating some general that
[1:11:41.360 --> 1:11:47.200]  didn't deserve it no no no this war was set up by the globalists it that region was corrupted by
[1:11:47.200 --> 1:11:52.160]  the globalist trump is fighting the same globalist forces the same deep state forces he's been fighting
[1:11:52.160 --> 1:11:55.840]  it's just now they can spin it about war and everything where they used to ignore it
[1:11:57.840 --> 1:12:06.400]  exactly on and i think you and alex are really on point and i i see your um seriousness in this
[1:12:06.400 --> 1:12:11.680]  issue and i think what you're saying is accurate and correct that trump isn't perfect and we don't
[1:12:11.680 --> 1:12:18.480]  necessarily have to support everything trump does but let's grow up people i mean he's this
[1:12:18.480 --> 1:12:25.600]  is a complex issue he can't just do things out of this idealistic nonsense fake land i mean this
[1:12:25.600 --> 1:12:30.640]  is the real world yeah we we should write the white house we should write congress if he does
[1:12:30.640 --> 1:12:36.960]  something bizarre and he does do things that all of us don't agree with but let's support him and
[1:12:36.960 --> 1:12:44.480]  then make our voice known uh let's not attack alex and oan because they i really genuinely think if
[1:12:44.480 --> 1:12:49.680]  anyone listens to this show i call in every single day well and look i appreciate people that are
[1:12:49.680 --> 1:12:54.480]  upset about foreign interventions and even people that want to attack us it's just it's just i hope
[1:12:54.480 --> 1:12:59.040]  they understand like again we're info wars is not your enemy and and i don't even think you
[1:12:59.040 --> 1:13:02.720]  could say trump is your enemy even if you're against all these these strikes in the middle east i
[1:13:02.720 --> 1:13:08.560]  mean it's bad stuff but it's been ongoing for a while and again you just you juxtapose that
[1:13:08.560 --> 1:13:13.200]  with what's been happening in past administrations while the outrage now thanks for the call richard
[1:13:13.200 --> 1:13:19.440]  let's go to sandy in minnesota uh i know that they're celebrating in minnesota today go ahead sandy
[1:13:20.560 --> 1:13:26.080]  hey oan thanks for taking my call i'm sorry i'm a little horse but thanks to silver bullet wait
[1:13:26.080 --> 1:13:29.760]  you're a little horse i've never had a little horse call into the show before this is amazing
[1:13:29.760 --> 1:13:38.320]  i'm talking to a horse go ahead okay stop sorry sandy i just having some fun here go ahead i i heard
[1:13:38.320 --> 1:13:44.720]  your show yesterday and and i understand where where you're upset it's true you know you can sit
[1:13:44.720 --> 1:13:52.560]  there in armchair all you want on what trump is going to do but until you're actually in his shoes
[1:13:52.560 --> 1:14:00.720]  we need to support him we need to support him but what what really gripes me is i was looking through
[1:14:00.720 --> 1:14:08.400]  some of these bright part articles and okay it says obama um bypasses congress to give
[1:14:09.040 --> 1:14:17.280]  1.5 billion to the muslim brotherhood obama gave 221 million to palestine in his last
[1:14:17.280 --> 1:14:28.080]  hours of his uh presidency you know and then he goes and he supports el qaeda and stuff like that
[1:14:28.080 --> 1:14:35.760]  where was the outrage then exactly that's why i'm saying it's the same it's it's it's a new thing
[1:14:35.760 --> 1:14:41.280]  but it's the same thing it's the same people responsible for all this crap trying to frame
[1:14:41.280 --> 1:14:48.000]  trump for it and so again exactly where was the outrage when obama surpassed congress for all the
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:52.960]  funding and all the arms deals and all of that there was no outrage where was the outrage when
[1:14:52.960 --> 1:14:57.360]  obama was drone striking left and right which by the way most of that we didn't even know about
[1:14:57.360 --> 1:15:02.640]  till months or years later innocent civilians were killed weddings were struck with trump we know
[1:15:02.640 --> 1:15:07.840]  who he struck when he struck and why he struck we get the coordinates we see the video but there's
[1:15:07.840 --> 1:15:12.480]  all this outrage over trump even though the obama administration said soulimani was a terrorist
[1:15:12.480 --> 1:15:17.760]  so again it just is another level of illustration of the lies of the deep state the lies of the
[1:15:17.760 --> 1:15:22.560]  new world order and how it doesn't matter what trump does trump could literally like simon says
[1:15:22.560 --> 1:15:30.480]  do everything obama did and they'd say trump bad for it obama a hero exactly exactly and you know
[1:15:30.480 --> 1:15:36.640]  do you ever notice or maybe it's just me but when he ran on his trump ran on his campaign
[1:15:36.640 --> 1:15:43.680]  he mentioned um bill clinton getting impeached for what's happening to trump he mentioned um
[1:15:44.800 --> 1:15:48.720]  you know all this stuff obama and you know you mentioned that i gotta go to break but you know
[1:15:48.720 --> 1:15:52.720]  it's almost perfect nancy with nancy withholds the articles of impeachment and then all this
[1:15:52.720 --> 1:16:01.360]  stuff and i ran happens mm-hmm i keep my eye on the news all the time but i miss the fact that
[1:16:01.360 --> 1:16:11.200]  in late 2019 just about two weeks ago the cdc and the fda approved live ebola vaccine
[1:16:12.080 --> 1:16:19.200]  to be given inside the united states and it is an experimental vaccine it is live it's not even
[1:16:19.200 --> 1:16:25.840]  attenuated they've just genetically modified it so it's supposedly not lethal same stuff they did
[1:16:25.840 --> 1:16:33.040]  with the garter cell vaccine that's admittedly killed a man so many this is just crazy and the
[1:16:33.040 --> 1:16:38.160]  congos had the biggest outbreaks of ebola ever since they started giving the vaccine there in
[1:16:38.160 --> 1:16:43.920]  the last few years oh and of course opening the borders up here and letting people in unfettered
[1:16:43.920 --> 1:16:49.760]  the democrats distribute across the country you cannot make up the magnitude of this insanity
[1:16:49.760 --> 1:16:56.880]  and it is an attempted ebola assault on america this is the new world order i would thank you for
[1:16:56.880 --> 1:17:02.240]  everything you've done for the info war but i know you're like me you don't want my thanks you want

[1:20:53.840 --> 1:20:59.600]  wars i'm a big fan and also i'm here in la i'm friends with sable table and also leo's i got me
[1:20:59.600 --> 1:21:05.200]  i've been on the show before you played at maxine waters uh funko thinking that she was with creta
[1:21:05.200 --> 1:21:12.640]  that was just a window into how crazy this whole thing is i'm in south la man she's the brightest
[1:21:12.640 --> 1:21:19.120]  person in the con in her constituents by the way so that just gives you an idea what the power of
[1:21:19.120 --> 1:21:24.880]  i call it the possession of the electromagnetic field because what's happening is that foreigners
[1:21:24.880 --> 1:21:31.680]  own the airways of the united states of america so we need to go back to the 1938 communications
[1:21:31.680 --> 1:21:38.560]  fact which is under the executive branch of five commissioners of the fcp are all american citizens
[1:21:38.560 --> 1:21:44.080]  and they issue licenses to who gets to broadcast anything in the airways of the electromagnetic
[1:21:44.080 --> 1:21:52.160]  field of the united states of america so we basically need to deal with that as soon as possible
[1:21:52.160 --> 1:21:58.160]  with the executive order from president trump yeah and again it's just amazing that you can
[1:21:58.160 --> 1:22:04.640]  have adam schiff and maxine waters get get duped so easily it just shows you how pathetic these
[1:22:04.640 --> 1:22:10.080]  members of congress are and at a certain level it's a gut blow to think wow maxine waters has
[1:22:10.080 --> 1:22:15.600]  been in congress for 30 years and and she's so stupid i mean that's what it is she's so stupid
[1:22:15.600 --> 1:22:21.920]  and gullible she can be trolled into giving a speech to a country that doesn't exist with a fake
[1:22:21.920 --> 1:22:26.960]  grev thunberg on the phone on a whim i mean she needs to be removed from office immediately
[1:22:28.320 --> 1:22:33.920]  that is why they are suppressing the truth let me tell you something owen the most powerful thing
[1:22:33.920 --> 1:22:39.680]  in the universe is the human mind you don't want ordinary people to know that they keep them in the
[1:22:39.680 --> 1:22:44.480]  dark for a reason and they're killing them with all that you know by the way your info
[1:22:44.480 --> 1:22:51.760]  were products are excellent but they're selling the masses trash and deadly poison no that's really
[1:22:51.760 --> 1:22:57.680]  know who they are intellectual poison spiritual poison and and literal physical chemical poison
[1:22:57.680 --> 1:23:02.560]  let me tell you something man scholars would agree all scholars from all the universities
[1:23:02.560 --> 1:23:08.160]  would agree on two things there was a man that existed in the world his name was jesus and he
[1:23:08.160 --> 1:23:13.280]  was baptized by john the baptist the other thing too that we know that for sure is that he was
[1:23:13.280 --> 1:23:18.800]  crucified and on top of the cross there was a charge that said king of the jews so we know
[1:23:18.800 --> 1:23:23.280]  that there was a man who was baptized and he was crucified and was killed because he can't claim to
[1:23:23.280 --> 1:23:33.040]  be king of the jews but he said this i am the truth i am the light i am the life no one comes to the
[1:23:33.040 --> 1:23:40.640]  father except to me and his words to this day applies to every single one of us know the truth
[1:23:41.840 --> 1:23:48.960]  so we are dealing with some serious demons out there and that is why the electromagnetic
[1:23:48.960 --> 1:23:53.600]  field needs to be taken back to the united states Donald Trump needs to sign an executive order
[1:23:53.600 --> 1:23:59.520]  immediately going back to 1934 before the 1996 telecommunications act of bilkin which he actually
[1:23:59.520 --> 1:24:06.640]  opened the floodgate for all those people to come and reclaim our power and it really just comes
[1:24:06.640 --> 1:24:12.160]  down to americans being vigilant before uh and again you're just looking it's like the same thing
[1:24:12.160 --> 1:24:19.520]  like you know where are all these apple products uh manufactured and put together china what about
[1:24:19.520 --> 1:24:23.440]  nike i mean these are the two things nike dominates the sports world apple dominates the tech world
[1:24:23.440 --> 1:24:28.800]  these are american companies and institutions and what happens they make everything in china
[1:24:29.840 --> 1:24:34.480]  okay so that's just an example let's go to quarry in california as well go ahead quarry
[1:24:34.480 --> 1:24:41.280]  hey there oh and they still have to take my call now uh so i want to uh i have a few things i want
[1:24:41.280 --> 1:24:46.640]  to mention uh since the other call or brought it up uh i want to thank you for your evangelical
[1:24:46.640 --> 1:24:52.880]  efforts uh i didn't actually believe in jesus before i started listening to your show um i've
[1:24:52.880 --> 1:25:00.560]  had experiences where i have learned for pretty much beyond doubt that demons are real and uh when
[1:25:00.560 --> 1:25:06.960]  i prayed to jesus and the heavenly father uh they went away and for a brief moment they stopped
[1:25:06.960 --> 1:25:13.360]  to work for me and then when i started doubting it uh they came back so i uh i was afraid to believe
[1:25:14.160 --> 1:25:20.000]  the other thing i wanted to mention is that uh i bought your iodine it works great it gives me a
[1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:25.360]  lot of energy i feel like my body's working a lot better now i bought some toothpaste for my dad
[1:25:25.360 --> 1:25:31.200]  um he used to use fluoride toothpaste and uh converted more to non-flourish so that's pretty
[1:25:31.200 --> 1:25:39.760]  cool i want to thank you for that uh thank you yeah no problem now uh so about trump i think i
[1:25:39.760 --> 1:25:44.000]  i think i don't i mean i don't want anybody to die but i think what he did is a good thing because
[1:25:44.800 --> 1:25:49.520]  you have to shut you have to send a message uh other presidents might have done that by
[1:25:50.240 --> 1:25:54.320]  as you said bombing weddings doing all these horrible things that make this country stay
[1:25:54.320 --> 1:26:00.320]  does and uh taking out a military leader the like the top military leader that shows uh
[1:26:01.280 --> 1:26:06.560]  i mean it shows what we're strong it shows that we're gonna do uh we're gonna take the proper
[1:26:06.560 --> 1:26:10.560]  routes to deal with yeah and you know what let me just hone in on that for a second and again
[1:26:10.560 --> 1:26:16.320]  believe me i'm no warmonger i don't want to see any foreign intervention let's just you know i'm
[1:26:16.320 --> 1:26:21.600]  just doing play by play here colored commentary by by trump initiating these last two strikes you
[1:26:21.600 --> 1:26:27.920]  know iran can come out here and talk about striking us targets and and talk about further strikes
[1:26:27.920 --> 1:26:35.440]  and threaten nuclear war or whatever but you see i think they know better than that because they've
[1:26:35.440 --> 1:26:40.400]  now seen trump will take action and they know whatever retaliation they take is going to be
[1:26:40.400 --> 1:26:45.360]  10 times worse on them again i'm not supporting that folks this is just this is the real world
[1:26:45.360 --> 1:26:52.400]  here this is what we're dealing with and so uh at the very least that was the message sent and i mean
[1:26:52.400 --> 1:26:59.920]  look this isn't it's kind of almost funny but like for iran to say 80 million dollars for
[1:26:59.920 --> 1:27:04.880]  trump's head i mean that that's kind of a joke folks i mean that's that's that's almost comical
[1:27:04.880 --> 1:27:10.560]  it's so pathetic i mean 80 million dollars that's either literally like i mean i don't even know
[1:27:10.560 --> 1:27:15.600]  how you how how you analyze that that's either them saying yeah this is a huge joke or them basically
[1:27:15.600 --> 1:27:20.640]  saying like we're poor i mean so i i don't know how you analyze that but that it's crazy go ahead
[1:27:20.640 --> 1:27:26.880]  kory yeah absurd uh the other thing is i want to mention i have a recommendation for your website
[1:27:27.680 --> 1:27:33.440]  uh sometimes you guys mention public access documents like i think the white papers you
[1:27:33.440 --> 1:27:39.440]  talk about maybe public access and these other things i want to recommend that you start a
[1:27:39.440 --> 1:27:44.560]  document archive on your website where you for you host these white papers and other things that
[1:27:44.560 --> 1:27:49.920]  you mentioned you can use them as uh show citations but not might be a good idea uh i don't know if
[1:27:49.920 --> 1:27:54.000]  you already do but if not i just want to recommend you know we may but here's what i'll respond to
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:59.600]  this and this isn't uh this isn't uh a dig at you this is just a response because i i have stuff
[1:27:59.600 --> 1:28:03.360]  like this all the time and this is really the formula for victory i understand why people
[1:28:03.360 --> 1:28:08.560]  look to the mothership here at info wars to do more and put more out there and be even you know
[1:28:08.560 --> 1:28:13.040]  more effective and victorious believe me we're doing everything we can plus we're taking on water
[1:28:13.040 --> 1:28:17.200]  and we have a tiny little spoon trying to get it out of here so we don't sink so what we need is
[1:28:17.200 --> 1:28:23.840]  people like you kory to create that archive call it government archives dot com or whatever you can
[1:28:23.840 --> 1:28:29.760]  and then you become that person and then you become a a a spot for information and then people
[1:28:29.760 --> 1:28:34.640]  source your website for information and then maybe we can link up your site or promote your site so

[1:31:56.480 --> 1:32:00.400]  i want to talk about super silver whitening toothpaste because i hadn't tried it
[1:32:00.400 --> 1:32:05.280]  except for maybe the last week and a half and i told alex i said man this is the best toothpaste

[1:32:14.320 --> 1:32:19.520]  is by far the best toothpaste i've ever tried and i'm 45 years old and i've tried a lot of
[1:32:19.520 --> 1:32:24.640]  different toothpaste and it's fluoride free i think the big difference the game changer in
[1:32:24.640 --> 1:32:29.840]  this is the coral calcium because after i brush my teeth with this they feel so clean and the
[1:32:29.840 --> 1:32:34.640]  toothpaste that i don't even like rinse out my mouth after i brush my teeth with this it feels so
[1:32:34.640 --> 1:32:41.040]  good it feels like it feels like good things are happening in my mouth in fact i find myself
[1:32:41.040 --> 1:32:46.800]  brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now because i like the way

[1:34:19.120 --> 1:34:26.240]  you know regularly here um i wanted to talk about uh what happened with the rating of the
[1:34:26.240 --> 1:34:33.120]  offices of ex-president of ukraine poroshenko and i think this is really important we've got
[1:34:34.160 --> 1:34:41.120]  you know his office is rated he owned a gym um his gym was rated and we had his
[1:34:43.440 --> 1:34:48.720]  they found that there were cameras and mics and the smoke detectors in his gym that he owned
[1:34:48.720 --> 1:34:58.960]  uh and that is also they have rated the ukrainian seaport in uh various places in ukraine
[1:34:59.680 --> 1:35:08.640]  this is um in odessa kiev areas around it and it's it's a big deal because yeah you know and
[1:35:08.640 --> 1:35:13.440]  this is a huge deal and and you know i don't even know if this is a fair uh comparison here
[1:35:13.440 --> 1:35:20.640]  but it would be it would be similar to trump you know rating the obamas and investigating the
[1:35:20.640 --> 1:35:27.520]  obamas and we don't get any of that and one thing that's really important is that um poroshenko one
[1:35:27.520 --> 1:35:35.600]  of the things they're looking for is that he stole servers from his uh presidential offices
[1:35:35.600 --> 1:35:41.440]  servers we know that president trump said how about the servers solensky what about
[1:35:41.440 --> 1:35:47.280]  crowd strikes well they actually were looking for servers that were stolen out of poroshenko's
[1:35:47.280 --> 1:35:54.480]  offices that's one of the reasons they rated him uh this all happened in the last few days of the
[1:35:54.480 --> 1:36:03.040]  last year and this was simultaneous with rating ukrainian seaport authority uh where they rated
[1:36:03.040 --> 1:36:13.040]  offices in um uh uh well it was navu right this is this was navu doing this and they rated the
[1:36:13.040 --> 1:36:19.440]  offices um in the seaport authority detectives from the national anti-corruption bureau
[1:36:20.960 --> 1:36:28.960]  and the scu the ukrain secret service they rated these offices looking for illegal procurement of
[1:36:28.960 --> 1:36:38.480]  construction services for a marine infrastructure and this is for illegal preference for foreign
[1:36:38.480 --> 1:36:47.120]  companies given a marine infrastructure to basically provide a what looks like a nuclear
[1:36:48.400 --> 1:36:56.400]  off-port infrastructure for pretty much taking energy out of ukraine this is all rated it all
[1:36:56.400 --> 1:37:04.000]  happened december 27th and it happened um in poroshenko at the same time and nobody's really
[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:10.960]  talking about it in the in the news we had a little bit of a a small uh special yeah that's
[1:37:10.960 --> 1:37:15.280]  because it's not really sexy most people don't understand the deep geopolitics of it and the
[1:37:15.280 --> 1:37:20.560]  media will continue to cover up for the globalists in the deep state as they always have and they
[1:37:20.560 --> 1:37:25.600]  know that the biden's the obama administration the clintons and uh some of their political
[1:37:25.600 --> 1:37:29.840]  operatives with with companies such as crowd strike are deeply involved with the ukraine
[1:37:29.840 --> 1:37:33.520]  because of the corruption so yeah they're not going to highlight that uh but excellent
[1:37:33.520 --> 1:37:38.720]  informative call from free in massachusetts let's go to pastor sam in sexus go ahead pastor sam
[1:37:40.400 --> 1:37:45.840]  you know the doom and gloom preachers we like to borrow a quote from the terminator judgment day
[1:37:45.840 --> 1:37:53.120]  is inevitable doesn't matter what we do world war three will happen global war will happen
[1:37:53.120 --> 1:37:58.880]  and we have a president one for once in our lives that's willing to face it willing to
[1:37:58.880 --> 1:38:04.160]  face that threat and he's bringing a lot of troops home to defend the americas he's trying
[1:38:04.160 --> 1:38:09.920]  to get out of the middle east like you commented like alex has commented he sees the threat from
[1:38:09.920 --> 1:38:17.520]  asia and without getting into anything from my classified briefing uh the americas are on fire
[1:38:17.520 --> 1:38:23.600]  right now the venezuela situation has boiled over today including fist fights in the parliament
[1:38:24.400 --> 1:38:30.560]  there have been three very suspicious crash accidents the last two of which were aircraft
[1:38:30.560 --> 1:38:36.080]  with generals on board in three different western nations well one of them is taiwan but that really
[1:38:36.080 --> 1:38:42.880]  affects china moving to the americas them getting rid of taiwan so there's already military action
[1:38:42.880 --> 1:38:48.800]  happening just nobody wants to admit that this is military activity when airplanes disappear with
[1:38:48.800 --> 1:38:52.880]  generals on board or with the top general of the country you know everybody's screaming about
[1:38:52.880 --> 1:39:01.680]  solomony and really hardly anybody in the news talked about the very top general from taiwan dying
[1:39:01.680 --> 1:39:07.600]  in a suspicious crash of a military aircraft with seven other persons all of whom were very very
[1:39:07.600 --> 1:39:13.760]  high ranking and so i would just like for everyone to buckle up realize that this is inevitable
[1:39:14.320 --> 1:39:21.200]  realize that the president is determined to uh defend the hemisphere and that the americas
[1:39:21.200 --> 1:39:26.720]  are on fire you'll have to surf around the net a little bit to find that but there is serious
[1:39:26.720 --> 1:39:31.920]  conflict in the americas today that's part of the reason the president is drawing back because he
[1:39:31.920 --> 1:39:37.120]  knew that was going to happen thanks for taking my call a vitamin mineral fusion and x2 those are
[1:39:37.120 --> 1:39:41.920]  my favorites thank you for the call patcher sam another excellent caller our callers are so

[1:40:05.680 --> 1:40:10.800]  again um i've been doing a lot of thought about this i think the deep state is about to really
[1:40:10.800 --> 1:40:18.720]  release a bio weapon we need to to put all available military on the u.s and canadian border
[1:40:18.720 --> 1:40:23.760]  and trump needs to act on this quickly no i completely agree and this is such common sense
[1:40:23.760 --> 1:40:28.720]  it's almost offensive that we don't do it i mean there's not going to be a foreign invasion
[1:40:28.720 --> 1:40:35.120]  from iraq in iraq because it's in iraq it's going to be at the southern border it's going to be at
[1:40:35.120 --> 1:40:40.000]  the northern border it's very porous it's a serious situation and all these people want to sit here
[1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:46.080]  and bitch and moan oh iran's gonna get us oh iran please don't kill us oh 80 million dollars for
[1:40:46.080 --> 1:40:50.800]  trump's head i mean come on uh trump farts 80 million dollars again i'm not trying to like
[1:40:50.800 --> 1:40:55.600]  say oh they're porous just like that's kind of a joke so for all these people that complain
[1:40:55.600 --> 1:41:01.680]  oh iran's gonna kill us well then we buy are you for uh closing the border now you understand
[1:41:01.680 --> 1:41:06.960]  why we want a southern wall at the border i mean it's like but they still don't get it because
[1:41:06.960 --> 1:41:16.880]  they're so filled with hate they have no common sense left anything else bark yeah i just wanted
[1:41:16.880 --> 1:41:21.040]  to say i've been i'm live streaming this on the bark fine channel on youtube and everybody

[1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:38.400]  hey what's up this is crazy because we got three in a row here yeah you know i still do in my
[1:41:38.400 --> 1:41:43.600]  live stream we get past our stand we got part almost every night in there and it's funny because
[1:41:43.600 --> 1:41:48.000]  a couple callers ago talked about taking action and you were talking about making a website and
[1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:52.320]  getting and doing your own thing making your voice that's what i try to do every single night
[1:41:52.320 --> 1:41:57.520]  thanks for taking my call i wanted to talk about iran and basic geography if you look at a map people
[1:41:57.520 --> 1:42:02.720]  you can see that this has been something in slow motion right before our face for a long time iran
[1:42:02.720 --> 1:42:08.240]  sits right in between iraq and afghanistan where our troops have been put in there by the tens of
[1:42:08.240 --> 1:42:13.360]  thousands over the last two decades and right over on the side of the other side of persian gulf there
[1:42:13.360 --> 1:42:18.240]  you have saudi arabia so again if you look at basic geography all throughout time you can
[1:42:18.240 --> 1:42:25.040]  see a war happen right before your eyes sometimes and the crew was just pulling it up from this week
[1:42:25.040 --> 1:42:33.120]  care assisting iranians at the border look again i'm not sitting here i don't hate iranians i don't
[1:42:33.120 --> 1:42:38.960]  hate the iranian people i don't want to see war with iran most americans don't but if you're gonna
[1:42:38.960 --> 1:42:45.280]  sit here and say oh my gosh trump's gonna get us killed i'm so afraid of iran but then you promote
[1:42:45.280 --> 1:42:50.080]  having an open border and being so tolerant and diverse that you literally bring in foreign agents
[1:42:50.080 --> 1:42:58.080]  to kill you i mean that's the definition of insanity but that's what the left is
[1:42:58.480 --> 1:43:05.120]  as i drive in to the central texas information warfare command center in austin texas it is
[1:43:05.120 --> 1:43:14.160]  january 2nd 2020 and you only have four days left as of me taping this to take advantage of the

[1:43:56.400 --> 1:44:03.680]  i keep my eye on the news all the time but i miss the fact that in late 2019 just about two weeks
[1:44:03.680 --> 1:44:14.160]  ago the cdc and the fda approved live ebola vaccine to be given inside the united states
[1:44:14.160 --> 1:44:22.000]  and it is an experimental vaccine it is live it's not even attenuated they've just genetically
[1:44:22.000 --> 1:44:27.520]  modified it so it's supposedly not lethal same stuff they did with the garter cell
[1:44:27.520 --> 1:44:33.840]  vaccine that's admittedly killed and made so many this is just crazy and the congos had the
[1:44:33.840 --> 1:44:39.360]  biggest outbreaks of ebola ever since they started giving the vaccine there in the last few years
[1:44:39.360 --> 1:44:44.720]  oh and of course opening the borders up here and letting people in unvetted the democrats
[1:44:44.720 --> 1:44:51.200]  distribute across the country you cannot make up the magnitude of this insanity and it is an attempted
[1:44:51.200 --> 1:45:00.080]  ebola assault on america this is the new world order info wars life dot com info wars life

[1:47:25.120 --> 1:47:31.440]  troyer all right final segment of this sunday show let me hit these headlines before i go back out
[1:47:31.440 --> 1:47:40.720]  to your phone calls inside jeffrey eppstein's cell sunday on 60 minutes so of course that's
[1:47:40.720 --> 1:47:45.120]  this evening 60 minutes is going to be running maybe running on the east coast right now actually
[1:47:46.160 --> 1:47:51.280]  inside eppstein's cell now i've seen the previews there is some powerful information here but you
[1:47:51.280 --> 1:47:58.560]  know it's ironic this comes out what three months after eppstein's fake suicide so info wars literally
[1:47:59.200 --> 1:48:04.320]  again next month's news today when 60 minutes can't even keep up with us it's not even close
[1:48:04.320 --> 1:48:08.640]  and you know there's going to be all kinds of twists and turns and spins on this deal
[1:48:09.200 --> 1:48:12.640]  and they probably won't mention the clintons they're not allowed to which you know what i
[1:48:12.640 --> 1:48:20.320]  didn't mean to do this but by the way what's the lady's name who spiked the eppstein story on abc
[1:48:20.320 --> 1:48:28.880]  you remember it was gene or something anyway you know gene a robot amy robot you know people
[1:48:28.880 --> 1:48:34.160]  were saying oh don't be so mean to amy oh it's not her fault and i kind of backed off a little but
[1:48:34.160 --> 1:48:43.440]  you know what that woman hosts like all these shows at abc she's a sellout so no i am gonna i
[1:48:43.440 --> 1:48:48.640]  am gonna sit here and point the finger at amy robot you sold out you took the million dollar
[1:48:48.640 --> 1:48:55.200]  contracts you spiked the eppstein story and you still are so no i don't feel bad for amy robot
[1:48:55.200 --> 1:49:01.200]  with her millions of dollars for spiking a pedophile network story screw that i can't turn
[1:49:01.200 --> 1:49:07.280]  on abc without her hosting good morning america hosting this hosting that now we know why sorry
[1:49:07.280 --> 1:49:13.840]  i didn't mean to rant on that it's just a reminder report jislane maxwell under x special forces guard
[1:49:13.840 --> 1:49:20.960]  due to credible death threats apparently us navy seals are guarding her well uh boy i hope that's
[1:49:20.960 --> 1:49:26.240]  not government funded i'd like to know why she either isn't in jail or being investigated or
[1:49:26.240 --> 1:49:36.080]  interrogated maybe she is but uh this is just ridiculous i mean it's just ridiculous man there's
[1:49:36.080 --> 1:49:40.960]  you know the largest child sex trafficking largest sex trafficking network you know young girls
[1:49:40.960 --> 1:49:49.040]  blackmail network and it's just like you know the guy killed himself prince andrew beg jislane
[1:49:49.040 --> 1:49:57.920]  maxwell to clear his name over eppstein scandal too late for that jack this talk about this is
[1:49:57.920 --> 1:50:02.560]  this is rich right here the comical irony of this next headline from the hollywood reporter
[1:50:02.560 --> 1:50:08.400]  winestein attorney says accuser anabella scoria has spent an entire life acting for a living
[1:50:08.400 --> 1:50:12.640]  it's like yeah because she's an actress
[1:50:15.040 --> 1:50:18.400]  where winestein probably took advantage of her and this whole thing again
[1:50:20.160 --> 1:50:24.800]  i'm not going to sit here and attack winestein or defend winestein but the whole me too thing
[1:50:24.800 --> 1:50:29.680]  was contrived and it was meant to be aimed at donald trump and that failed and so now people
[1:50:29.680 --> 1:50:34.320]  like eppstein and cosby are taking the brunt whether they deserve it or not
[1:50:34.320 --> 1:50:43.280]  terry gilliam faces backlash after labeling me too a witch hunt well again the me too movement was
[1:50:43.840 --> 1:50:49.760]  not a witch hunt but it was a false flag intended to be aimed at donald trump that failed
[1:50:50.320 --> 1:50:54.320]  then it just became legitimate things that are happening in hollywood and the median such
[1:50:55.920 --> 1:51:00.880]  with people like winestein and then that got exposed but then the truth is well everybody
[1:51:00.880 --> 1:51:04.800]  kind of knew it was going on and there was some give and take there and it's just total degeneracy
[1:51:04.800 --> 1:51:10.400]  coming out of hollywood everybody knew that the real me too is bill clinton the real me too is
[1:51:10.400 --> 1:51:15.040]  hollywood not donald trump that's the false flag that's the witch hunt of it the real me too is
[1:51:15.040 --> 1:51:20.640]  jeff rey eppstein they all knew it and they all ignored it another anti-semitic incident under
[1:51:20.640 --> 1:51:28.800]  investigation in new york uh yeah but you know but you know all the the the black people assaulting
[1:51:28.800 --> 1:51:33.440]  jews in new york nothing to see here because white people are the terrorists according to uh
[1:51:33.440 --> 1:51:38.720]  i mean that was literally i think the cia to put that up bloomberg rises to third place alongside
[1:51:38.720 --> 1:51:44.000]  warren in national poll now i may have to go back and highlight my odds making of the democrat
[1:51:44.000 --> 1:51:49.040]  nominee because it really has been spot on but let me just i'm gonna give some free advice right
[1:51:49.040 --> 1:51:55.920]  now to michael bloomberg and tom steyer because this is incredible that their campaign team
[1:51:55.920 --> 1:52:03.920]  may be the worst ever they are running ads at the top of their ads that feature donald trump
[1:52:04.480 --> 1:52:09.520]  for example mike bloomberg's ad says donald trump wants to end obama care these people
[1:52:09.520 --> 1:52:16.480]  are so politically illiterate so media illiterate they're literally promoting donald trump at the
[1:52:16.480 --> 1:52:23.040]  top of their political campaign ads which is going to be the most percentage of the ad seen
[1:52:23.040 --> 1:52:28.960]  and they don't even have enough realization self-awareness to get it so they're literally
[1:52:28.960 --> 1:52:36.960]  promoting trump in their ads and not even realizing it folks uh but if they're that stupid i can't
[1:52:36.960 --> 1:52:41.760]  imagine what they're going to be doing for the next 11 months hong kong activates serious response
[1:52:41.760 --> 1:52:47.520]  as chinese mystery illness prompts hospital lockdown mm-hmm 44 people have been admitted to
[1:52:47.520 --> 1:52:52.400]  the hospital with the unidentified virus uh and of course people here are worried about
[1:52:52.400 --> 1:52:55.840]  something like that happening all right let's go back out to the phone lines to close it out
[1:52:55.840 --> 1:52:58.240]  mason in vancouver island go ahead mason
[1:53:01.040 --> 1:53:07.680]  hi it's yes nathan from vancouver island uh parents get the super blue immune gargle spray
[1:53:07.680 --> 1:53:13.040]  one ounce spray it's like five bucks right now okay i'm talking censorship here i hope we can all
[1:53:13.040 --> 1:53:22.400]  agree that online censorship equals digital book burning and with that i've got a quote from 1823
[1:53:22.400 --> 1:53:30.320]  from heinrich heinie quote whenever they burn books they will also in the end burn people
[1:53:30.320 --> 1:53:36.640]  and quote and my next quote a final quote is to secret donald trump's secret service
[1:53:36.640 --> 1:53:47.040]  George bernard Shaw about 100 years ago 1916 quote assassination is the extreme form of
[1:53:47.040 --> 1:53:54.800]  censorship and quote look it's it's martin looser king's uh juniors day in two weeks
[1:53:55.920 --> 1:54:05.280]  these freak shows um with their illuminati new numerology secret service we have to stop it
[1:54:05.280 --> 1:54:12.240]  before it starts that's that's the info wars mantra expose it and we can stop it thank you
[1:54:13.600 --> 1:54:19.680]  well it is it's such a complex thing for people to understand it's not an insult to the audience
[1:54:19.680 --> 1:54:27.440]  i mean i have trouble understanding it where do you even measured that it's like i'll make a sports
[1:54:27.440 --> 1:54:33.440]  analogy like if you know what the if you're on offense and you just realize the defense just
[1:54:33.440 --> 1:54:38.720]  found out what play you're calling or now you have to call an audible too and so there's no
[1:54:38.720 --> 1:54:44.720]  way for us to measure how many times info wars has caused that to happen uh but yeah sometimes
[1:54:44.720 --> 1:54:49.760]  people say how dare you say that not even realizing as the defense we just forced the offense to
[1:54:49.760 --> 1:54:55.200]  call an audible so yeah we're in serious times right now you know there are forces that be that
[1:54:55.200 --> 1:54:59.920]  want to assassinate the president and it's a joke to sit here and act like that's going to be iran
[1:54:59.920 --> 1:55:03.360]  in fact now that i'm thinking about it more that just seems like a frame up in a setup
[1:55:03.360 --> 1:55:07.600]  80 million dollars what trump said they might as well have said 80 billion dollars
[1:55:07.600 --> 1:55:13.040]  because that's ridiculous 80 million dollars so either iran's that desperate and that broke
[1:55:13.600 --> 1:55:17.760]  or or they just like oh we're just putting it out there like we're going to assassinate trump
[1:55:18.400 --> 1:55:24.960]  it's another failure folks but yeah i hey look i still question the death of solo money i'm not
[1:55:24.960 --> 1:55:28.960]  saying it didn't happen i'm not trying to start a conspiracy theory but hey you know maybe some
[1:55:28.960 --> 1:55:34.640]  people wanted him dead for all the other reasons maybe he was a man that knew too much let's go
[1:55:34.640 --> 1:55:44.000]  to mark in indiana go ahead mark hey i want to mark here uh don't stop doing what you're doing
[1:55:44.000 --> 1:55:51.280]  you and uh everybody there you know men will love it you know what can i say uh i'd like to talk about
[1:55:51.280 --> 1:55:59.760]  uh our southern border what i'd like to see president bring all the troops back
[1:56:01.040 --> 1:56:08.480]  and uh let's defend our southern border better you know uh well yes especially for national
[1:56:08.480 --> 1:56:13.600]  security reasons right now i mean everybody wants to sit here and hype up world war three uh you
[1:56:13.600 --> 1:56:17.920]  know media hollywood social media entertainment it's all about world war three world war three
[1:56:17.920 --> 1:56:23.040]  well let's protect our damn border then huh see but that's see but it just exposes how fake they all
[1:56:23.040 --> 1:56:28.080]  are it just exposes how fake they all are they're going to sit here in fear monger over world war
[1:56:28.080 --> 1:56:36.240]  three and they're going to call for open borders right i think we ought to go into mexico the 12
[1:56:36.240 --> 1:56:42.080]  mile limit remember the 12 mile limit out the ocean i think i'd get the president of mexico's
[1:56:42.080 --> 1:56:48.640]  attention you know hey let's clean up these drug dealers you got down here the this uh
[1:56:49.360 --> 1:56:54.400]  all all these people that's getting killed that that you know that's uncalled for and it makes more
[1:56:54.400 --> 1:56:59.920]  sense look and that's the thing the problems in the middle east that trump is trying to take care of
[1:56:59.920 --> 1:57:03.520]  are really not our problems now they're problems that were started by the west and and british
[1:57:03.520 --> 1:57:07.680]  intelligence and and former administrations but they're not really our interests or our problems
[1:57:07.680 --> 1:57:11.440]  it's protecting the deep state which i'm sick of doing i get it so is the audience we need to
[1:57:11.440 --> 1:57:16.400]  protect our own interests at the southern border drugs are pouring in weapons are pouring in who
[1:57:16.400 --> 1:57:20.160]  knows what could be pouring in that's the point and now they want to sit here and hype up world war
[1:57:20.160 --> 1:57:24.800]  three and they don't even have to wear with all or the common sense to protect the southern border
[1:57:24.800 --> 1:57:29.200]  but that's because it's all fake folks just like everything's fake the me too movement fake they
[1:57:29.200 --> 1:57:34.160]  never call out bill clinton they never call out ebstein world war three fears fake they never call
[1:57:34.160 --> 1:57:38.400]  for the protection of the southern border these people are fake as the day is long ladies and
[1:57:38.400 --> 1:57:41.680]  gentlemen that does it for the alex jones show today be sure to tune in tomorrow we'll be back
