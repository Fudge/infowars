[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.720]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:20.720 --> 00:38.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are seeing criminal investigations and indictments by the Obama
[00:38.920 --> 00:46.680]  administration of people that work for the federal government who just talk to Fox News
[00:46.680 --> 00:55.480]  and tell them their opinion. That's what reporters do. We call people sources in the government
[00:55.480 --> 00:59.400]  and we try to get their opinion. Hey, what do you think is gonna happen? Not what's classified,
[00:59.400 --> 01:02.480]  but what do you personally think is going on with Kim Jong-un?
[01:02.480 --> 01:12.360]  Oh, well, we'll just arrest you and I guess they're looking at arresting Fox News reporters.
[01:12.360 --> 01:18.440]  And even the London Guardian is saying this is authoritarian chilling effect and is incredibly
[01:18.440 --> 01:24.360]  dangerous. The president of the Associated Press, which you don't get any more establishment
[01:24.360 --> 01:29.880]  than that, is saying this is unconstitutional and dangerous what's going on. And then a
[01:29.880 --> 01:33.160]  massive chilling effect has already taken place.
[01:33.160 --> 01:39.000]  That's some of what's coming up today. And you notice when they have White House spokesman
[01:39.000 --> 01:47.000]  out there, who do they really attack? Drudgereport.com. And their surrogates like Media Matters that's
[01:47.000 --> 01:55.320]  admittedly White House run, obsesses on info wars.com. And all the other Democratic Party
[01:55.320 --> 02:02.860]  run sites. And again, I'm just a constitutionalist. I fear the Republican machine. The issue though
[02:02.860 --> 02:11.520]  is I've never seen anything like Obama. It is at light speed the tyranny that we're seeing
[02:11.520 --> 02:12.520]  unfold.
[02:12.520 --> 02:20.560]  Adam Kokesh, I heard Saturday he'd been arrested at a pro-marijuana legalization rally for not
[02:20.560 --> 02:26.640]  even smoking pot. I saw the video and now we've confirmed that they're still holding
[02:26.640 --> 02:33.640]  him in a federal prison. So he walked on federal land they use at a federal park in Philadelphia.
[02:33.640 --> 02:38.640]  They use that as the quickest way to grab him.
[02:38.640 --> 02:42.520]  And then now he's charged today reportedly they're gonna charge him with resisting. Show
[02:42.520 --> 02:46.780]  the cart before the horse, they come up and grab you. You put your hands up, they throw
[02:46.780 --> 02:52.900]  you on the ground and then you're arrested for them assaulting you. Cart before the horse,
[02:52.900 --> 02:57.160]  how do you get arrested for resisting arrest? What was the reason to arrest you?
[02:57.160 --> 03:01.260]  Most states have laws saying you can't do that. Courts have thrown it out for the feds.
[03:01.260 --> 03:07.560]  They don't care. So that article is up on infowars.com. Activists rally to free Adam
[03:07.560 --> 03:14.040]  Kokesh, calls floods, seeks to secure, release a former Marine kidnapped for exercising First
[03:14.040 --> 03:19.220]  Amendment. And we've got his libertarian cohorts, Lucas Jewell and Darrell Young who were on
[03:19.220 --> 03:23.880]  last night with us popping in at the bottom of the hour.
[03:23.880 --> 03:27.200]  When they would go to the jail, they would yell at them and tell them we're not gonna
[03:27.200 --> 03:32.180]  tell you even where he is. So that's eyewitnesses that had this happen. They're in Philadelphia
[03:32.180 --> 03:37.700]  right now, covering this. And now the reports are coming out on their Facebook. We'll find
[03:37.700 --> 03:38.700]  out when they come on.
[03:38.700 --> 03:46.620]  That when you call the federal prison, skip court, skip trials, just go directly to federal
[03:46.620 --> 03:53.640]  prison, NDAA style. Reportedly, they're saying we blew his head off. Now we haven't confirmed
[03:53.640 --> 03:57.960]  this yet. You're like, man, that's a terroristic threat. That's a felony. Feds don't care.
[03:57.960 --> 04:01.960]  I mean, hell, they like burn up little kids and roast marshmallows while they're doing
[04:01.960 --> 04:06.800]  it. They ship in narcotics. This country's far and run. They want you to know this is
[04:06.800 --> 04:07.800]  their country.
[04:07.800 --> 04:13.680]  That's why they're arresting press and doing all this. This is their nation. And they deserve
[04:13.680 --> 04:19.320]  a peace prize for it. So we're gonna be breaking down this. And again, they need to break your
[04:19.320 --> 04:24.360]  will. That's what the TSA, bobbing for goodies in your pants is for. That's what all of this
[04:24.360 --> 04:28.720]  is about. So that's coming up after the break.
[04:28.720 --> 04:35.520]  There's an incredible article up on infowars.com that's in the local news. And they report
[04:35.520 --> 04:43.800]  it in the local news like it's a good thing. Italian shotgun maker at a gun show loaded
[04:43.800 --> 04:52.040]  the fine shotguns in the vehicle legally lawfully. And the snitch program, the taxi driver, all
[04:52.040 --> 04:55.960]  the police on them. And they still arrested him even though no law was violated and told
[04:55.960 --> 04:56.960]  him get out.
[04:56.960 --> 05:04.120]  So he fled in fear. I had tried everything. I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[05:04.120 --> 05:09.240]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working. My body was literally starving
[05:09.240 --> 05:13.960]  for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins. And as soon as I had that, I
[05:13.960 --> 05:19.360]  immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied. Now there are
[05:19.360 --> 05:24.200]  hundreds of great products at infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have
[05:24.200 --> 05:30.640]  helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[05:30.640 --> 05:35.480]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Holland Burst and Rebound. When I started taking the
[05:35.480 --> 05:41.000]  Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[05:41.000 --> 05:47.320]  Now that's results. I want to challenge my listeners to go to infowarsteam.com and order
[05:47.320 --> 05:52.420]  just three of their products. And you will see the changes in the way you look, feel

[06:05.920 --> 06:11.560]  immunity and health. At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing

[07:01.760 --> 07:06.000]  There's been a disaster and most of you don't even realize the terrible danger we're in.
[07:06.000 --> 07:10.400]  Alex Jones has warned you for years to get a good food storage. We thought the danger
[07:10.400 --> 07:15.920]  was drought, or food delivered to our gas tanks, or our food sold to other countries,
[07:15.920 --> 07:20.700]  or food so expensive that only those on food stamps and welfare could afford it. But we
[07:20.700 --> 07:25.560]  have just experienced the most effective way to lose your freedom, liberty, and security
[07:25.560 --> 07:32.600]  without even a fight. Government regulation. After a 160-year tradition of self-reliance,
[07:32.600 --> 07:36.960]  the do-it-yourself and charitable Mormon food storage canneries in half the country are
[07:36.960 --> 07:43.640]  forced to shut down due to excessive government regulations. Grow your own food, more regulations.
[07:43.640 --> 07:50.040]  If you've ever been warned to get food while you can, this is it. Call 800-409-5633 or
[07:50.040 --> 07:57.880]  on the web, efoodsdirect.com slash Alex. That's 800-409-5633 or on the web, efoodsdirect.com
[07:57.880 --> 08:09.680]  slash Alex.
[08:27.880 --> 08:51.680]  You better stand. There's no turning back. The bugle sounds, the charge begins. But on
[08:51.680 --> 08:57.720]  this battlefield, no one wins. That's what all the fools joining the New World Order
[08:57.720 --> 09:04.400]  are going to realize, joining the dehumanization, joining the guilds of psychopaths and sadists
[09:04.400 --> 09:10.280]  and control freaks. You are destroying our entire future by selling out to this New World
[09:10.280 --> 09:11.280]  Order.
[09:11.280 --> 09:17.120]  All right, here's the deal, ladies and gentlemen, on this live Monday edition, the 20th day
[09:17.120 --> 09:24.880]  of May 2013, we have Lucas Jewell and Darrell Young joining us about political prisoner
[09:24.880 --> 09:31.480]  Adam Kokesh, who went on to a federal park in Philadelphia and was grabbed and disappeared
[09:31.480 --> 09:35.720]  into a federal prison. And reportedly, they're saying some pretty obscene stuff when you
[09:35.720 --> 09:37.840]  call and ask where he's at.
[09:37.840 --> 09:43.840]  They just can't wait to fully go after everybody, folks, and feel sorry for them. They've taken
[09:43.840 --> 09:50.520]  our restraint as a sign of weakness when it's the opposite. Also, Kristin Meghan is on,
[09:50.520 --> 09:57.320]  she was in the Air Force and is an insider, just gone public last week, whistleblower.
[09:57.320 --> 10:01.480]  She'd given a couple speeches and she went public on Nightly News last week. And I saw
[10:01.480 --> 10:05.800]  this interview with Sha'Carri Jackson and had my mouth hanging open because everything
[10:05.800 --> 10:11.420]  she said fits my deep research on the admitted programs, but the details are classified.
[10:11.420 --> 10:17.160]  This is the Air Force, weather modding, geoengineering, terra farming to whatever they want for the
[10:17.160 --> 10:22.120]  climate here. That's coming up at the bottom of the next hour. And then in studio, Joel
[10:22.120 --> 10:28.200]  Scousum will give us his take on all of the different Benghazi gates, IRS gate, press
[10:28.200 --> 10:30.840]  spying gate, all of that in studio.
[10:30.840 --> 10:36.240]  He's here to be interviewed for Obama Deception 2. And he'll also be on the Nightly News with
[10:36.240 --> 10:41.320]  yours truly tonight. We're gonna look at why strategic relocation. Not because we're in
[10:41.320 --> 10:48.800]  fear, but because we're in charge. And specifically, where are the elite going? Just so happens,
[10:48.800 --> 10:53.400]  I've noticed that where Joel Scousum recommends is where the elite are going.
[10:53.400 --> 10:57.480]  And of course, Joel Scousum won't say this on air. It's not a secret, but he advises
[10:57.480 --> 11:04.320]  billionaires, millionaires, you name it. I mean, he really is the top of his game, building
[11:04.320 --> 11:12.440]  high security houses and other type fortresses. So he's going to be joining us in studio today,
[11:12.440 --> 11:18.480]  always informative, and survived a one in a million plane crash about a month ago that
[11:18.480 --> 11:20.240]  made national news.
[11:20.240 --> 11:24.520]  The plane completely destroyed, he survived with a small scratch on his head. He certainly
[11:24.520 --> 11:29.400]  is counting his lucky stars, his lucky angels on that front. So Joel Scousum is gonna be
[11:29.400 --> 11:30.400]  joining us.
[11:30.400 --> 11:35.720]  Okay, this is happening worse and worse, and I have a burning frustration once I get off
[11:35.720 --> 11:41.760]  air every day that I don't cover everything. I'm lucky if I get 20% of it. Let me just
[11:41.760 --> 11:47.520]  try to do it this way. And God give me strength, let me do it this one time and just read the
[11:47.520 --> 11:51.920]  stinking headlines instead of commenting on them.
[11:51.920 --> 11:56.600]  Because I mean, I studied last night, I studied this morning. I get in here, I go over it
[11:56.600 --> 12:00.800]  all, and I get so angry looking at it. It's so over the top. Let me just try to read you
[12:00.800 --> 12:05.040]  these headlines. Some of these, let's just start with stuff I didn't get to yesterday,
[12:05.040 --> 12:06.040]  okay?
[12:06.040 --> 12:13.200]  Let's just start with that. This is from Reuters. Taxes on some wealthy French tops 100% of
[12:13.200 --> 12:18.720]  income. And that's one of the major newspapers there in France breaking that down, Reuters
[12:18.720 --> 12:25.560]  reports. 100% while the EU bureaucrats are exempt and pay zero, and that's come out.
[12:25.560 --> 12:31.200]  I'm sorry, I said I'd only read the headline. It's 100 times worse. This is their plan.
[12:31.200 --> 12:38.280]  Total slavery. Google insider exposes immoral tax scam. Top Google executive goes public
[12:38.280 --> 12:43.440]  and says that they have a scam to pay zero tax. Sunday Times of London, they're so liberal.
[12:43.440 --> 12:49.600]  Suicide nets at Apple. Merkel and Pope talk about strong Europe. USA Today, it's strong
[12:49.600 --> 12:53.960]  imploding national sovereignty, bankrupting families.
[12:53.960 --> 13:00.640]  Dear class of 2013, you've been scammed. The Wall Street Journal. How the college industrial
[13:00.640 --> 13:09.280]  complex drove tuition so high. I've been saying that for 17 years on air. So has people like
[13:09.280 --> 13:14.240]  Gerald Salente. But we're wrong telling you. Folks, I was in college and knew it was going
[13:14.240 --> 13:15.240]  to be worthless.
[13:15.240 --> 13:21.160]  I already knew more about RTF than they were teaching me. Because I went out and read books
[13:21.160 --> 13:28.320]  by famous directors and researchers and radio host. And my parents like, you're not gonna
[13:28.320 --> 13:32.200]  go to college, you're gonna drop out? I'm like, yeah, I'm gonna go get a job and I did.
[13:32.200 --> 13:37.280]  And here I am. Unbelievable. And then people always lecture me. You don't have a college
[13:37.280 --> 13:39.840]  degree? Like it's gonna get to me.
[13:39.840 --> 13:45.360]  Hey, you go bag groceries at the grocery store with your PhD, okay? I'll try to take the
[13:45.360 --> 13:50.840]  world back. How's that sound? All right, am I putting people down that have college degrees?
[13:50.840 --> 13:54.080]  It's just don't ring knock. You know what a ring knocker is? They take their college
[13:54.080 --> 13:59.920]  ring and they go on the table. I've actually had it done. I'm like, what the? You want
[13:59.920 --> 14:00.920]  some crony job?
[14:00.920 --> 14:07.700]  If you wanna go get a crony job, the most important thing at college is the fraternities.
[14:07.700 --> 14:11.280]  That's the only reason to go to college is if you're gonna try to get in the right fraternity
[14:11.280 --> 14:16.120]  and do whatever you've got to, to get into that elite fraternity, that has some value.
[14:16.120 --> 14:20.780]  It's nepotism. All right, let's continue here, ladies and gentlemen, to give a little college
[14:20.780 --> 14:23.220]  course here on how to actually go to college if you are.
[14:23.220 --> 14:30.040]  The IRS job is to violate our liberties, Ron Paul article on infoawars.com. Absolutely,
[14:30.040 --> 14:34.720]  that's its job, to watch the go to for all its criminality. That's just some of the news
[14:34.720 --> 14:40.200]  on that front. Here, let's look at this news stack from yesterday. Surgeons, this is if
[14:40.200 --> 14:46.460]  I didn't get to yesterday, surgeons now cutting out healthy prostate glands of men who carry
[14:46.460 --> 14:48.200]  the BRCA gene.
[14:48.200 --> 14:54.900]  But why is prostate cancer in the Western world up over 2,000% since the 1950s? Look
[14:54.900 --> 15:00.120]  it up. I think I'm being conservative. Some estimates of some types of prostate cancer
[15:00.120 --> 15:06.680]  up over 5,000%. Type 2 diabetes up several thousand percent in the US population. It's
[15:06.680 --> 15:13.720]  set to be half of Hispanics by 2015 and half of everybody by 2020.
[15:13.720 --> 15:21.460]  Look it up. Half of us are going to have burnout pancreases. Folks, we're not in Kansas anymore,
[15:21.460 --> 15:25.520]  and it's not that we're drinking more sugar. I've looked at the studies, people used to
[15:25.520 --> 15:30.720]  eat more unhealthy 30, 40 years ago. Everybody knows that. Hell, people were skinny, smoking
[15:30.720 --> 15:33.640]  two packs of cigarettes, drinking whiskey every night.
[15:33.640 --> 15:39.040]  You'd eat a big chicken fried steak, gravy, everything else, and then have a piece of
[15:39.040 --> 15:45.720]  cake and go to your office job and you didn't look like people do now. They feed GMO to
[15:45.720 --> 15:53.920]  the rats, they look just like us. I said, I try to just read each headline, I'm sorry.
[15:53.920 --> 15:59.360]  Surgeons now cutting out healthy prostate glands of men who carry BRCA gene, Mike Adams,
[15:59.360 --> 16:01.800]  naturalnews.com, mfowars.com story.
[16:01.800 --> 16:08.760]  UK man has prostate removed after test revealed Joe Lee gene flop. Again, we have predisposition
[16:08.760 --> 16:13.640]  with different genetics for different things. Some for heart disease, some for cancer, some
[16:13.640 --> 16:21.640]  for rage, that's an attribute. Some for depression, some for eczema, some for this, some for that,
[16:21.640 --> 16:24.960]  some to be more susceptible to the flu, some to not be.
[16:24.960 --> 16:28.880]  Some people have thicker skulls, some people can take a stronger punch. Some people are
[16:28.880 --> 16:32.980]  more susceptible to not being able to take a punch. Some people can take more crap, other
[16:32.980 --> 16:38.580]  people can. There's all sorts of people in the world. And it's our genetics, like some
[16:38.580 --> 16:48.280]  cars can take 1,200 or 7,000, whatever it is, RPMs, 10,000, 15,000 RPMs.
[16:48.280 --> 16:53.400]  Some cars can't take 5,000 RPMs, you'll blow the engine. I forget the RPM designation.
[16:53.400 --> 16:59.280]  You don't say, this car needs to have its engine removed because it can't have super
[16:59.280 --> 17:08.340]  RPMs like a souped up Corvette. You don't say this car has bad genes. Ladies and gentlemen,
[17:08.340 --> 17:13.680]  this is the garbage. They're telling you it's your genes that have the problem. But we already
[17:13.680 --> 17:19.880]  had these same genes 50 years ago, 60 years ago, and weren't dying in mass.
[17:19.880 --> 17:28.080]  Didn't have, what's the increase of from one in 30,000 with autism? And a one in 25,000
[17:28.080 --> 17:32.600]  30 something years ago to now one in 50 something. I mean, how many tens of thousands of percentile
[17:32.600 --> 17:38.240]  increases that? This stuff is off the chart and no one wants to talk about it. They wanna
[17:38.240 --> 17:39.880]  just ease us into this death.
[17:39.880 --> 17:45.680]  And then Angelina Jolie has both her breasts removed. And again, the different types of
[17:45.680 --> 17:50.840]  eye cancer are up, very rare, now become in common. Do we have our eyes removed preemptively?
[17:50.840 --> 17:55.920]  Colon cancer is way up. Have your colon removed preemptively? Cancer of the lungs is way up,
[17:55.920 --> 17:57.520]  even though smoking's gone down, look it up.
[17:57.520 --> 18:01.480]  Are we gonna have our lungs removed? How about our brain, brain cancers? Cancers that weren't
[18:01.480 --> 18:05.120]  even known in the brain are skyrocketing cuz of different cancer viruses, mainly in the
[18:05.120 --> 18:09.600]  vaccines that embed themselves, that's on record. Should we have our brains removed?
[18:09.600 --> 18:13.560]  You're like, well, you would die with your brain removed. Let me tell you, you take your
[18:13.560 --> 18:20.640]  lung out, it's gonna ruin the rest of your life, folks. Do you have any idea the hell
[18:20.640 --> 18:23.100]  we're going into?
[18:23.100 --> 18:30.380]  And look at this, look at this headline. This is CBS News. CDC, one in five US school children
[18:30.380 --> 18:34.600]  may have mental disorder. That's cuz they're listing everything as a mental disorder. Feed
[18:34.600 --> 18:38.760]  them red dye, feed them high fructose corn syrup, put them in front of televisions and
[18:38.760 --> 18:43.360]  computers all day, rewire their brains, and then wonder why they act like gibbering idiots.
[18:43.360 --> 18:48.320]  And then the answer is put them on Ritalin, put them on other speeds, and their brains
[18:48.320 --> 18:51.720]  burn out. Then put them on other stuff, then put them on stuff to put them to sleep at
[18:51.720 --> 18:54.300]  night, and then you get drug addict zombies.
[18:54.300 --> 18:57.800]  And what did the New Freedom Initiative say in 2005? It was gonna do, the New Freedom
[18:57.800 --> 19:05.360]  Initiative, amply Orwellian named. They said, we're gonna put half the kids in America on
[19:05.360 --> 19:11.280]  psychotropics. And they went then from about 10% to 20%. So just in seven, eight, nine
[19:11.280 --> 19:15.180]  years, I don't know how many years that's, eight years, they've gone from 10% on drugs
[19:15.180 --> 19:16.180]  to 20%.
[19:16.180 --> 19:22.480]  And in captive audiences of foster kids, 68 to 69% national average, look it up, are on
[19:22.480 --> 19:28.760]  psychotropics alone. You add in other drugs, it's like 80 something percent, look it up.
[19:28.760 --> 19:34.760]  Look it up. When they have it, folks, these people are not going to stop. Do you understand?
[19:34.760 --> 19:39.280]  So I've got that whole stack of news. Now, I haven't even gotten into the huge IRS giant
[19:39.280 --> 19:40.500]  bombshell developments.
[19:40.500 --> 19:46.440]  The giant stalking and persecution of Fox News reporters for just going and asking a
[19:46.440 --> 19:51.740]  State Department person, do you think Kim Jong-un is really unstable? You're arrested
[19:51.740 --> 19:57.400]  for that. I mean, this is a reign of terror if they get away with it. If they convert
[19:57.400 --> 19:59.920]  this, if they, if they go over the top, they're trying.
[19:59.920 --> 20:05.200]  Man, I love that buttstock pouch on your Mosin Nagant. Where'd you get it?

[20:29.860 --> 20:34.600]  We the people grow cotton, we fabric engraving embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit
[20:34.600 --> 20:39.000]  and carting to a private bank, having a lead back at interest, forcing taxes to service
[20:39.000 --> 20:42.800]  debt. This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public
[20:42.800 --> 20:46.560]  currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army. Ted Anderson,

[20:59.520 --> 21:04.960]  It's time for a home security quiz. What effective home security device is smaller than a coffee
[21:04.960 --> 21:09.580]  cup fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home at your house while you're away plugs
[21:09.580 --> 21:14.760]  into any wall outlet is recommended by many police departments and sells for less than
[21:14.760 --> 21:21.120]  $30? Yes, it's fake TV. This year about one in every 50 US homes will have a break in
[21:21.120 --> 21:26.560]  with burglars usually picking the easy target, a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[21:26.560 --> 21:31.580]  Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching
[21:31.580 --> 21:37.440]  TV by simulating the light from a real TV. Fake TV could be the difference between coming
[21:37.440 --> 21:43.920]  home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked. To get your fake TV for only $29.95

[24:11.760 --> 24:18.040]  continue just randomly here with a stack. I have no exaggeration. Thirty-something stacks
[24:18.040 --> 24:22.560]  of every article off the chart. I could spend three hours on it, going into the background
[24:22.560 --> 24:27.800]  of it, what it means, what it signifies. And again, the good news is that America and the
[24:27.800 --> 24:32.540]  world is really starting to wake up. And when you realize how passive the general public
[24:32.540 --> 24:36.600]  is that isn't awake, that's how the globalists have gotten away with all this. But for those
[24:36.600 --> 24:42.040]  of us that are awake and active, we can basically take the world back, folks. I've been doing
[24:42.040 --> 24:46.600]  some tests locally, I'm gonna talk about in the next few weeks, just to see how powerless
[24:46.600 --> 24:52.480]  the system is. And it's incredible. It's incredible that if we all just start resisting and
[24:52.480 --> 24:58.840]  in little ways, it will fail. And you've also got to discredit the system, speak out against
[24:58.840 --> 24:59.840]  them.
[24:59.840 --> 25:05.840]  That power of saying, you're crooks, we know you're illegitimate. They need people to go
[25:05.840 --> 25:12.000]  along with the fraud that the government's run by good guys. And yeah, the guy on the
[25:12.000 --> 25:16.800]  street may be the best guy in the world. The cop on the beat, I gotta say it, and I looked
[25:16.800 --> 25:23.200]  it up, they were police. I ran into four cops yesterday at a university I was at.
[25:23.200 --> 25:29.160]  And they were all listeners. I mean, wild eyed listeners. And basically said, we're
[25:29.160 --> 25:33.720]  with the rebels, we know what's going on. So that's good news. But see, they are under
[25:33.720 --> 25:39.280]  the command of a corrupt system. So it's up to us to take that system back and not let
[25:39.280 --> 25:41.160]  the system play us off against them.
[25:41.160 --> 25:45.200]  Because as mad as I get at the police being out of control, that's part of the globalist
[25:45.200 --> 25:50.520]  plan is to hate them. So that we then get into a fight with each other instead of going,
[25:50.520 --> 25:54.160]  hey, what you're doing is wrong. I'm gonna speak out and resist what you're doing through
[25:54.160 --> 25:58.440]  the Constitution. But I'm not gonna hate you because you're screwing your own future as
[25:58.440 --> 25:59.440]  well.
[25:59.440 --> 26:03.440]  And I'm gonna try to give aid and comfort to good police and good military that have
[26:03.440 --> 26:08.520]  courage to stand up and do the right thing. And I'm telling you, folks, that's the essence
[26:08.520 --> 26:15.180]  of having a free society is just doing what's right and standing up. It's that Aaron Tibbitt
[26:15.180 --> 26:18.320]  stepping song. We ought to try to dig that up and come back with it. I know it's in the
[26:18.320 --> 26:20.040]  computer.
[26:20.040 --> 26:24.480]  Daddy didn't like trouble, but if it came along, everyone that knew him knew which side
[26:24.480 --> 26:32.760]  that he'd be on. And the song goes on that he wasn't a hero or this county shining light,
[26:32.760 --> 26:38.160]  but you could always count on him to do what was right. And I'm actually the type of person
[26:38.160 --> 26:43.360]  that doesn't enjoy trouble. I'm a very private, very quiet person off air.
[26:43.360 --> 26:46.880]  But I can't help it when somebody tries to wrongfully dominate me. And if they've got
[26:46.880 --> 26:52.160]  a look of dominance in their eyes, trying to intimidate me, man, you just hit my buttons.
[26:52.160 --> 26:56.500]  And I've done everything I can in 18 years, really 20 years fighting, but 18 years on
[26:56.500 --> 27:01.480]  air to fight them. And look what I've built. And I'm nobody, folks. I know who you are
[27:01.480 --> 27:03.280]  out there.
[27:03.280 --> 27:08.120]  I know your leaders, it's in you. And you know you're a leader if you've got that tingle
[27:08.120 --> 27:12.600]  in your heart and soul right now. If you've got that electricity in your mind right now,
[27:12.600 --> 27:17.160]  that's because you know your destiny is to stand up and be a leader. So stop trying to
[27:17.160 --> 27:22.800]  make a pilgrimage to Austin, Texas to meet Alex Jones.
[27:22.800 --> 27:26.320]  And think that that's where you're gonna get the answers of what you should do. I mean,
[27:26.320 --> 27:31.840]  they go to 590 AM now, 20, 30 people a day where I've got their managers calling me begging
[27:31.840 --> 27:36.120]  going, tell people you're not here. They don't believe it. They're camped out, 20, 30 people
[27:36.120 --> 27:44.440]  a day. One of my old addresses, they show up 20, 30 a day. Look, I'm not at South Lamar,
[27:44.440 --> 27:47.440]  I'm not off Mary Street, and I'm not at the 590 studios.
[27:47.440 --> 27:51.200]  And I can't meet with you, folks. I'm having to battle the New World Order. The only reason
[27:51.200 --> 27:54.960]  I just brought that up was to not brag, but to tell you how popular the show's getting.
[27:54.960 --> 28:02.560]  And because of the request by all those other offices, the please, please, they beg, please,
[28:02.560 --> 28:08.600]  we cannot conduct business. In fact, they haven't said this, but you'll probably just
[28:08.600 --> 28:09.600]  get me kicked off the radio.
[28:09.600 --> 28:14.800]  And it's that bad. I mean, imagine, it's like they're trying to meet Elvis or something
[28:14.800 --> 28:19.480]  over there. And the only reason I bring that up is, is that that's not where I'm at, okay?
[28:19.480 --> 28:24.000]  And it won't matter, they'll still just show up by the dozens a day. Believe me, I know,
[28:24.000 --> 28:27.400]  we had to get a secret location because of it.
[28:27.400 --> 28:31.320]  Just like you will talk to me, you will talk to me, I cannot talk to you. I'm in here at
[28:31.320 --> 28:36.520]  the guns, in the info war, fighting the globalist, okay? All right, I've covered that, I've done
[28:36.520 --> 28:41.720]  what they asked again, that's all I can do. And they tell him he's not here and they go,
[28:41.720 --> 28:42.720]  I know you're lying.
[28:42.720 --> 28:46.560]  And they say most of them are really sweet, really nice. But they said, you get 20, 30
[28:46.560 --> 28:54.960]  people, sometimes more a day. And one a day, in all these places, they beg, they beg. Places
[28:54.960 --> 29:00.800]  where I've lived formerly, they beg. Places where I don't live, I get other Alex Jones's
[29:00.800 --> 29:05.280]  through the grapevine finding it, sending me letters to the PO box going, can you please
[29:05.280 --> 29:07.980]  say you don't live in Austin anymore?
[29:07.980 --> 29:11.920]  They're climbing the gate and coming to my house and leaving trinkets on my front door,
[29:11.920 --> 29:19.080]  my wife's freaked out. My wife tells them that I'm not the Alex Jones they think I am.
[29:19.080 --> 29:27.760]  It's sick, man. It's unbelievable. I think I'm gonna move again, just to move. And again,
[29:27.760 --> 29:32.480]  it's not that I just can't handle it. I mean, I am under frickin' siege here, excuse me.
[29:32.480 --> 29:38.400]  All right, I apologize, Lord. All right, we're gonna come right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[29:38.400 --> 29:43.600]  And we're gonna get into the news and get the latest on Adam Kokesh. But a guy at a
[29:43.600 --> 29:48.280]  Denver gun show legally bought shotguns or brought shotguns to sell and they arrested
[29:48.280 --> 29:49.880]  him, we're gonna get to that.

[32:58.720 --> 33:22.480]  shop dot com. Now daddy didn't like trouble. But he became alone. Everyone that knew him
[33:22.480 --> 33:31.360]  knew each side that he'd be on. He never was a hero for this county shining light. But
[33:31.360 --> 33:38.760]  you could always find him standing up for what he thought was right. He'd say you've
[33:38.760 --> 33:44.760]  got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything. You've got to be your own man.
[33:44.760 --> 33:54.960]  Not a puppet. Never compromise what's right. Never compromise what's right. And uphold
[33:54.960 --> 34:01.200]  your family name. You've got to stand for something. You'll fall for anything. That's
[34:01.200 --> 34:05.800]  Aaron Dippin. And if you go to the YouTube channel with millions of views on that, people
[34:05.800 --> 34:10.240]  make fun of the song. Oh, you've got to stand for something or fall for anything. That's
[34:10.240 --> 34:14.960]  what I heard growing up. That's what the kind of things my grandfather said.
[34:14.960 --> 34:19.160]  And you know, my grandfather's weren't heroes. They weren't anything special, but they didn't
[34:19.160 --> 34:24.960]  give in. They didn't back down. And that's why America was still somewhat free. But what
[34:24.960 --> 34:30.080]  is our culture today? Who are you? I mean, I know our listeners are Liberty lovers. I
[34:30.080 --> 34:34.360]  know who you are, but who are the hundreds of thousands of new listeners today? That's
[34:34.360 --> 34:35.960]  a conservative estimate.
[34:35.960 --> 34:41.460]  Standing on AM and FM stations all over the country, watching this on YouTube later, listening
[34:41.460 --> 34:52.200]  to us on shortwave, on XM, channel 244. Who are you? What if I say I'm not like the others?
[34:52.200 --> 34:56.800]  What if I say I'm not one of your slaves? You're the pretender. What if I say I will
[34:56.800 --> 35:03.580]  never surrender? If you don't have freedom, you don't have anything else. And acting like
[35:03.580 --> 35:07.000]  slaves makes you a slave.
[35:07.000 --> 35:11.440]  And the end of slavery is when you realize what's going on is the beginnings of slavery
[35:11.440 --> 35:16.740]  and is wrong. I mean, now they're arresting members of the State Department and looking
[35:16.740 --> 35:21.260]  at arresting a Fox News reporter cuz they talked to somebody at the State Department.
[35:21.260 --> 35:25.480]  The guy was visiting the State Department above board. I've called the State Department
[35:25.480 --> 35:29.400]  getting gassed on before, getting people on that worked at the State Department are working
[35:29.400 --> 35:35.000]  there. And hey, so what are you as the liaison expert on North Korea?
[35:35.000 --> 35:40.240]  What do you think? I mean, do you think Kim Jong-un's really that dangerous? I mean, that's
[35:40.240 --> 35:45.920]  in the London Guardian today, quotes of what is going on. Well, none of us know, but we
[35:45.920 --> 35:52.000]  think he is pretty unstable and that he may actually do more nuclear testing. Look at
[35:52.000 --> 35:53.000]  this.
[35:53.000 --> 35:59.280]  This is out of London Guardian. Obama DOJ formally accuses journalists in leaked case
[35:59.280 --> 36:04.180]  of committing crimes. Yet another serious escalation of the Obama administration's attacks
[36:04.180 --> 36:08.360]  on press freedoms emerges. It is now well known that the Obama Justice Department, this
[36:08.360 --> 36:14.020]  is the ultra liberal guardian, Obama Justice Department has prosecuted more government
[36:14.020 --> 36:20.320]  leakers under the 1917 folks, that's the Espionage Act, which was unconstitutional, than all
[36:20.320 --> 36:25.200]  prior administrations. Espionage is if you were giving info to a foreign government.
[36:25.200 --> 36:30.320]  That's what Obama does, put in our military under NATO. Obama Justice Department has prosecuted
[36:30.320 --> 36:35.600]  more government leakers under the 1917 Espionage Act than all prior administrations combined.
[36:35.600 --> 36:41.360]  In fact, double the number of all such prior prosecutions. I said a few weeks ago, I said
[36:41.360 --> 36:45.100]  triple what Bush did, just cuz I knew it was a big number and I forgot it.
[36:45.100 --> 36:49.000]  And I went and looked it up. Bush didn't even really do that. It's more than all presidents
[36:49.000 --> 36:55.120]  before him combined. But at last week's controversy of the DOJ's pursuit of phone records of AP
[36:55.120 --> 37:00.880]  illustrated this obsessive fixation in defense of secrecy, targets and severely damages journalists
[37:00.880 --> 37:03.760]  specifically and the news gathering process in general.
[37:03.760 --> 37:08.920]  The president of the AP says there's already a chilling effect. Duh, think so? And they're
[37:08.920 --> 37:14.760]  putting all this out now, folks, cuz they wanna just scare you. Stephen Kim, a naturalized
[37:14.760 --> 37:19.760]  citizen from South Korea who was indicted in 2009 for allegedly telling Fox News Chief
[37:19.760 --> 37:23.800]  of Washington correspondent, Jay's Rosen, that US intelligence believed North Korea
[37:23.800 --> 37:27.680]  would respond in addition to UN sanctions with more nuclear tests.
[37:27.680 --> 37:32.360]  Something Rosen then reported, Kim did not obtain unauthorized access classified information
[37:32.360 --> 37:37.480]  nor steal documents, nor sell secrets, nor pass them to enemies of the US. Instead, he
[37:37.480 --> 37:45.440]  gave his opinion, which is normal. By the way, that's why Colonel Schaefer isn't been
[37:45.440 --> 37:50.400]  coming on the show. He was threatened, and he's not even currently, he's in the Army
[37:50.400 --> 37:55.400]  Reserves, but he is in a Pentagon think tank, for coming on and saying in October everything
[37:55.400 --> 37:57.960]  that's now been confirmed from his sources.
[37:57.960 --> 38:02.160]  And now he's being threatened. And he did tell us that off record, and then later he
[38:02.160 --> 38:07.800]  said, we could say it on record. But he said, I have never had hell come down on me. And
[38:07.800 --> 38:10.760]  then he's always like, I'll come on in a few months, but he keeps saying, I'll come on,
[38:10.760 --> 38:11.760]  I'll come on, I'll come on.
[38:11.760 --> 38:18.680]  Well, it's out in the open, okay? That's America, where army colonels won't come on this show
[38:18.680 --> 38:24.640]  because they're afraid of this kind of crap. Because you're not even supposed to give your
[38:24.640 --> 38:30.600]  view or your opinion now in America. It's a giant, stinking, chilling effect. And you
[38:30.600 --> 38:34.400]  think I'm scared? No, I'm scared you won't recognize how serious this is.
[38:34.400 --> 38:38.760]  We should all band together as Americans, liberal, conservative, libertarian, it doesn't
[38:38.760 --> 38:45.560]  matter. Gay, straight, Christian, Muslim, Jewish, agnostic, atheist, it doesn't matter.
[38:45.560 --> 38:51.840]  Doesn't matter if you worship Count Chocula or Toucan Sam. You better recognize folks
[38:51.840 --> 38:57.000]  that, what's the old quote by the, I think it was Episcopal priest. He said, first they
[38:57.000 --> 39:00.880]  came for the labor unions, I said nothing, I wasn't in the labor union. Then they came
[39:00.880 --> 39:03.440]  for the communists, I wasn't a communist, so I said nothing.
[39:03.440 --> 39:07.280]  They came for the Jews, I wasn't Jewish, and I said nothing. Then they came for the Baptists
[39:07.280 --> 39:10.440]  and I wasn't Baptist, so I said nothing. And finally, when they came for me, there was
[39:10.440 --> 39:15.720]  nobody left. There was nobody left, because they'd already taken everybody. This is how
[39:15.720 --> 39:21.400]  tyranny works. And I told you day one, cuz I would get the manuals, which by the way,
[39:21.400 --> 39:23.960]  I guess they could try to arrest me for that.
[39:23.960 --> 39:28.840]  They sure figured out who gave it to me, federal and state. And I knew then, boy, they really
[39:28.840 --> 39:37.240]  are spying on people, folks. They're spying on everybody, that's what I'm saying. You
[39:37.240 --> 39:45.840]  understand how much we either run for the hills or we fight this thing politically.
[39:45.840 --> 39:49.920]  And as for me, you know what I'm doing in a fight? I didn't start this fight, they started
[39:49.920 --> 39:55.720]  it, they won't get off my back. I'm gonna open a can of good old boy whoop ass, politically.
[39:55.720 --> 39:59.120]  And I'm sorry to have to say that, but you know that feeling when somebody's punching
[39:59.120 --> 40:03.000]  in the head and you're seeing stars and something in you just goes, you know what? I'm gonna
[40:03.000 --> 40:08.080]  flip a switch, flip, boom, there's nothing gonna stop me.
[40:08.080 --> 40:13.300]  And folks, the only way to politically deal with these people is to flip that switch.
[40:13.300 --> 40:17.860]  It's time to flip the switch, folks, and stop playing games. When somebody tries to get
[40:17.860 --> 40:21.880]  in your face from government and dominate you and intimidate you, that is the spirit
[40:21.880 --> 40:28.320]  of pure evil and they wanna rob you of everything. They may not even know that cuz they hire
[40:28.320 --> 40:31.540]  people more and more that are mindless punks, but it doesn't matter.
[40:31.540 --> 40:36.940]  That is the ultimate rape when they do that. Now, I'm gonna go to our guest who are outside
[40:36.940 --> 40:45.720]  the federal facility, info wars. Their Skype just died, reconnected. Activists rally to
[40:45.720 --> 40:54.980]  free Adam Kokesh. Call Floods seeks to secure release of former Marine kidnapped for exercising
[40:54.980 --> 40:57.680]  First Amendment.
[40:57.680 --> 41:02.120]  Activists are rallying to secure the release of former Marine and broadcaster Adam Kokesh
[41:02.120 --> 41:07.160]  who was arrested by police in Philadelphia on Saturday during a speech he gave at a marijuana
[41:07.160 --> 41:10.720]  legalization protest. By the way, he did not have marijuana and did not smoke it.
[41:10.720 --> 41:15.240]  And they came and singled him out on federal property and disappeared him. And his girlfriend,
[41:15.240 --> 41:20.920]  his producers, none of them have heard from him. Do we have them back? We have them back.
[41:20.920 --> 41:24.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, some people are saying, hey, I don't like the fact this guy wants
[41:24.240 --> 41:28.520]  an armed march, so I'm not gonna support him. Hey, I don't particularly like the idea. That's
[41:28.520 --> 41:32.700]  why I haven't done it cuz I know they'll do stuff like this.
[41:32.700 --> 41:37.100]  But once he's committed to it, people gotta have cameras there as observers to try to
[41:37.100 --> 41:42.380]  not let them set people up. And the Supreme Court did rule in 2008, you can have loaded
[41:42.380 --> 41:48.400]  rifles in DC, and they've illegally not implemented the Constitution there. So I get like going
[41:48.400 --> 41:51.800]  to the lunch counter cuz you're black, and they tell you you're not allowed to, that's
[41:51.800 --> 41:52.840]  civil disobedience.
[41:52.840 --> 41:59.680]  It's breaking laws that are unconstitutional. They said, if you help slaves escape in 1855,
[41:59.680 --> 42:06.760]  we'll execute you. Well, people still helped blacks escape, and they prosecuted and executed
[42:06.760 --> 42:11.840]  some of them. And so then people like John Brown started killing people, and they called
[42:11.840 --> 42:18.600]  him a terrorist. But the point is, is that I don't want it to get to that cuz we're winning
[42:18.600 --> 42:22.640]  the fight in the info war, plus the people we're gonna be fighting are brainwashed.
[42:22.640 --> 42:26.960]  These are, on average, not bad people. Now, federal jail guards are another thing entirely.
[42:26.960 --> 42:30.640]  That's where they mainly hired people to run Abu Ghraib and other camps, were jail guards
[42:30.640 --> 42:34.960]  that had complaint list of rape and stuff around the torture that came out. So federal
[42:34.960 --> 42:38.040]  jail guards are as bad as it gets.
[42:38.040 --> 42:43.520]  And reportedly, Paul Watson saw this on the Facebook of Kokesh. We haven't confirmed it
[42:43.520 --> 42:47.040]  that it's actually happening. But people are saying when they call, there's jokes like,
[42:47.040 --> 42:51.440]  yeah, we shot Adam Kokesh in the head, which is a terroristic threat if it's true. But
[42:51.440 --> 42:56.040]  see, they don't care cuz they've been told, you're above the law, go after the Tea Party,
[42:56.040 --> 42:57.040]  go after everybody.
[42:57.040 --> 43:01.160]  And remember, the anti-terrorism stuff is pointed at the American people. We're joined
[43:01.160 --> 43:06.840]  by his two producers, Lucas Jewell and Darrell Young, who were on with us yesterday. Gentlemen,
[43:06.840 --> 43:10.240]  you're there. You're welcome to, after you talk, get out and show us some video shots
[43:10.240 --> 43:14.560]  of the federal facility. The phone numbers to call are up on infowars.com.
[43:14.560 --> 43:20.000]  But he's another talk show host, but I'm not in competition with him. I am in competition
[43:20.000 --> 43:24.120]  against the tyrants, and I'm pushing liberty, and we all hang together and we hang separate.
[43:24.120 --> 43:29.240]  And I've seen other talk show hosts making slide comments and things, and they're idiots.
[43:29.240 --> 43:34.200]  I expect if I ever get set up like this, that you're gonna support me. That's how the instinct
[43:34.200 --> 43:39.400]  of winning works. Gentlemen, give us the latest on what's happening to Adam Kokesh right now,
[43:39.400 --> 43:43.080]  who strayed onto Federal Park and got kidnapped.
[43:43.080 --> 43:50.440]  Well, we're right outside of Federal Detention Center Philadelphia right now, which is a
[43:50.440 --> 43:59.640]  federal prison. Today, Adam will be appearing in court in about 45 minutes. And we'll find
[43:59.640 --> 44:04.560]  out his bail and everything like that. We haven't been in contact with him. None of
[44:04.560 --> 44:09.280]  his family has been in contact with him. It's been a couple days now, so we're a little
[44:09.280 --> 44:11.720]  concerned.
[44:11.720 --> 44:18.200]  That's putting it lightly. I mean, he disappeared Saturday. What about the reports, and I haven't
[44:18.200 --> 44:22.240]  called yet, but others have, and I see a lot of it, that they're yelling at people. You
[44:22.240 --> 44:26.200]  told me they were rude. When he went in and tried to find out where he was yesterday,
[44:26.200 --> 44:30.880]  they wouldn't even say where he was. What can you say on that front?
[44:30.880 --> 44:36.220]  Well, we still have no information. We're going in there expecting to find something
[44:36.220 --> 44:40.580]  out because we have no knowledge of what he's being charged with. He said, we haven't had
[44:40.580 --> 44:44.720]  any contact from this man, and we're just a little concerned cuz that's our friend.
[44:44.720 --> 44:48.360]  Forget the business partner, that's our friend in this movement. And we haven't heard anything
[44:48.360 --> 44:49.360]  from him.
[44:49.360 --> 44:53.440]  A little concerned. I mean, we should all be concerned about this. You told me they
[44:53.440 --> 44:58.400]  were rude yesterday. What did they say to you?
[44:58.400 --> 45:02.080]  I believe it was Saturday when we went to the police office to find out where he was
[45:02.080 --> 45:05.920]  when he said he was picked up by the federal agents. They just said, hey, unless we're
[45:05.920 --> 45:09.240]  a lawyer, they can't provide any information to us. That was basically it.
[45:09.240 --> 45:13.100]  Yeah, that's pure bull. You're obviously his friend's on record. And his girlfriend hasn't
[45:13.100 --> 45:15.040]  heard from him, family hasn't, correct?
[45:15.040 --> 45:18.760]  Correct. Spoke to his girlfriend early this morning. As soon as I hear something, I would
[45:18.760 --> 45:21.880]  definitely contact her immediately. Nobody has heard anything.
[45:21.880 --> 45:27.760]  Spade, folks, do you realize this is like Russia or Nazi Germany? This is over the top.
[45:27.760 --> 45:31.720]  And by the way, he shouldn't be in a federal facility, usually a park police federal pick
[45:31.720 --> 45:35.920]  you up for being drunk or something. They give you the local police. He's in a federal
[45:35.920 --> 45:38.000]  jail, federal prison, correct?
[45:38.000 --> 45:42.080]  But Alex, we're the terrorists, so that's why he's in there. You know that.
[45:42.080 --> 45:46.220]  No, no, no, no, listen to this article. Denver cops, this is on local news. This isn't me
[45:46.220 --> 45:51.840]  saying this. Denver cops arrest Italian shotgun manufacturer as a terrorist because at the
[45:51.840 --> 45:57.600]  gun show, he loaded the $5,000 to $10,000 Italian shotguns that he hadn't sold in the
[45:57.600 --> 46:03.440]  back of the, imagine you pull up at a gun show, a rich Italian loads shotguns in the
[46:03.440 --> 46:08.000]  back of the car that he was unable to sell, one of the finest models out there.
[46:08.000 --> 46:13.160]  And they arrested him as a terrorist, and the news reports that like it's normal.
[46:13.160 --> 46:19.440]  Yeah, just recently we had one of our protesters out here open, carrying his firearm. And what
[46:19.440 --> 46:25.120]  they do call, no over-exaggerating, about 30 to 40 officers to come question this guy
[46:25.120 --> 46:31.520]  and bring him to the corner to find out if his gun is legit. And he's went out there
[46:31.520 --> 46:35.880]  blowing up buildings, killing babies, it's outrageous, and then there's police there.
[46:35.880 --> 46:41.760]  That's the globalist doing that. Specifically on Adam, my friend, specifically here. So
[46:41.760 --> 46:47.220]  no one has heard from him, and correct me if I'm wrong, but you said on radio yesterday,
[46:47.220 --> 46:50.320]  you went in to talk to him and they said, hey, we're not even gonna tell you where he's
[46:50.320 --> 46:51.320]  at.
[46:51.320 --> 46:53.880]  So how do we even know he's in the federal jail, cuz the police told you?
[46:53.880 --> 46:54.880]  Yeah.
[46:54.880 --> 46:57.200]  I'm telling people, nobody knows, we have yet to confirm it.
[46:57.200 --> 47:03.600]  Well, no, I believe it's BOP.gov, it's the Bureau of Prisons. And there is something
[47:03.600 --> 47:09.960]  on there, some people have sent me the link where it says that he's at FDC Philadelphia,
[47:09.960 --> 47:14.740]  which is right outside where we're at. Yesterday, we had a bunch of people out here, caught
[47:14.740 --> 47:19.360]  in a ruckus, making noise, and we ended up having all these prisoners banging on the
[47:19.360 --> 47:20.920]  windows and everything.
[47:20.920 --> 47:24.680]  So we caused quite a stir inside the prison.
[47:24.680 --> 47:27.880]  What about all the stuff we're seeing when people call, they're saying they've killed
[47:27.880 --> 47:28.880]  him?
[47:28.880 --> 47:34.600]  Well, I wouldn't put it past the government to do that, they've killed a lot of people.
[47:34.600 --> 47:36.880]  But I think it's highly unlikely that they actually did.
[47:36.880 --> 47:40.720]  Sure, sure, but I mean, what happens, what have you heard when people call? The phone
[47:40.720 --> 47:44.720]  numbers are on infoawards.com. What are you hearing?
[47:44.720 --> 47:48.480]  Well, whenever I call, I'm actually calling, not to disturb anyone, but calling to get
[47:48.480 --> 47:53.660]  serious information. I've been in contact with our lawyer, we have two different lawyers,
[47:53.660 --> 47:58.960]  and I'm actually just calling to try to get information. So I don't know what the fans
[47:58.960 --> 48:00.520]  are calling and saying or-
[48:00.520 --> 48:09.500]  Well, for those who don't know, well, they're supporters of Liberty. Look, here's the issue.
[48:09.500 --> 48:12.680]  Everybody's seen the video, but you were there, but I belong to all the angles now to make
[48:12.680 --> 48:17.280]  sure that people weren't being selective with it. He's up there giving a speech, they come
[48:17.280 --> 48:21.960]  and arrest him, and then throw him on the ground, and then disappear him. I mean, this
[48:21.960 --> 48:23.400]  is a kidnapping.
[48:23.400 --> 48:24.400]  It is.
[48:24.400 --> 48:28.800]  Yeah, it's a kidnapping, but society isn't gonna judge it as that because they're wearing
[48:28.800 --> 48:35.180]  funny costumes and shiny badges. They have a pseudo society granted monopoly on the use
[48:35.180 --> 48:37.680]  of force, that's what government is.
[48:37.680 --> 48:43.800]  Unbelievable. So gentlemen, points you wanna make?
[48:43.800 --> 48:47.960]  I just wanna see my brother, man. I want both of my brothers to be free, not only cold catch,
[48:47.960 --> 48:51.000]  but N.A. Poe is a political prisoner right now.
[48:51.000 --> 48:55.240]  Tell us who N.A. Poe is. So he disappeared into the snatch and grab.
[48:55.240 --> 49:00.320]  Yeah, he is the other half of the panic hour with Steve Miller Miller, just another political
[49:00.320 --> 49:06.180]  activist fighting the tyranny, just being active, educating people. And they wanna stop
[49:06.180 --> 49:09.040]  people like that because they can spread the message of liberty, and they wanna continue
[49:09.040 --> 49:10.620]  poisoning and brainwashing people.
[49:10.620 --> 49:15.520]  And it's people like that that's making the people at a large number. So if they silence
[49:15.520 --> 49:19.920]  them, they feel like they can silence that large number, but you can't stop what we do.
[49:19.920 --> 49:20.920]  They can't.
[49:20.920 --> 49:27.160]  Yeah, Alex, I was actually on the radio or internet radio show with some people you work
[49:27.160 --> 49:30.920]  with yesterday. And they told me, you know you're on the list, right? You know you're
[49:30.920 --> 49:34.920]  on the government list. If you're not on the list right now as an American citizen, you
[49:34.920 --> 49:36.260]  should be ashamed.
[49:36.260 --> 49:41.620]  You should be ashamed of yourself for not standing up against this brutal tyranny.
[49:41.620 --> 49:45.640]  People I work with? Somebody from my office?
[49:45.640 --> 49:48.240]  Someone who claimed they were affiliated with you.
[49:48.240 --> 49:53.680]  Well, everybody does that. I'm gonna ask you all who that was. Let's put this back up on
[49:53.680 --> 50:00.640]  screen here. There it is. That's at the federal prison's website. Adam Kokesh, register number
[50:00.640 --> 50:07.520]  69371-066, 41 year old white male.
[50:07.520 --> 50:09.080]  That's not true.
[50:09.080 --> 50:12.280]  Yeah, so they say he's 41. How old is Adam?
[50:12.280 --> 50:13.280]  31.
[50:13.280 --> 50:14.280]  31.
[50:14.280 --> 50:17.400]  Let's punch it back up so the feds can't even, pretty soon it'll be a conspiracy theory
[50:17.400 --> 50:23.240]  to be able to get a number right. And it says release date unknown, Philadelphia, FDC, Federal
[50:23.240 --> 50:27.880]  Department of Corrections. And there you go. So he's in there. We're gonna come back from
[50:27.880 --> 50:32.040]  break. I want you guys to get your laptop out and maybe give us a walking tour.
[50:32.040 --> 50:36.600]  Show us the facility when we come back in three minutes for prisonplanet.tv viewers,
[50:36.600 --> 50:37.600]  okay?
[50:37.600 --> 50:38.600]  Sounds good.
[50:38.600 --> 50:42.360]  All right, and also folks need to obviously go to adamversustheman.com and support what
[50:42.360 --> 50:46.520]  they're doing. And that's what we're here for. We're here as a platform to support everybody
[50:46.520 --> 50:52.860]  exercising their First Amendment. And this is shameful. The press is under attack. Demonstrators
[50:52.860 --> 50:57.960]  are under attack. Free speech is under attack. Mainline churches are being audited and told
[50:57.960 --> 51:00.920]  to say, hey, what are you praying?
[51:00.920 --> 51:06.200]  So a natural disaster strikes and out goes your power. You risk losing stored food in
[51:06.200 --> 51:11.680]  electric freezers and refrigerators, your options lose all that expensive food and medication
[51:11.680 --> 51:17.500]  fire up a noisy gasoline powered generator or switch now to a propane or natural gas
[51:17.500 --> 51:23.080]  powered refrigerator from Benz Discount Supply. BenzDiscountSupply.com has a complete line

[52:01.280 --> 52:05.520]  There's been a disaster and most of you don't even realize the terrible danger we're in.
[52:05.520 --> 52:09.920]  Alex Jones has warned you for years to get a good food storage. We thought the danger
[52:09.920 --> 52:15.760]  was drought or food delivered to our gas tanks or our food sold to other countries or food
[52:15.760 --> 52:20.720]  so expensive that only those on food stamps and welfare could afford it. But we have just
[52:20.720 --> 52:25.480]  experienced the most effective way to lose your freedom, liberty and security without
[52:25.480 --> 52:32.140]  even a fight. Government regulation. After a 160 year tradition of self-reliance, the
[52:32.140 --> 52:36.480]  do-it-yourself and charitable Mormon food storage canneries in half the country are
[52:36.480 --> 52:43.280]  forced to shut down due to excessive government regulations. Grow your own food, more regulations.
[52:43.280 --> 52:49.560]  If you've ever been warned to get food while you can, this is it. Call 800-409-5633 or
[52:49.560 --> 52:57.400]  on the web efoodsdirect.com slash Alex. That's 800-409-5633 or on the web efoodsdirect.com
[52:57.400 --> 53:00.100]  slash Alex.

[54:06.000 --> 54:09.000]  By the way folks, they're not just getting rid of the fourth and fifth amendment, the
[54:09.000 --> 54:13.180]  first, all of it, the tenth amendment. They're getting rid of everything and saying they're
[54:13.180 --> 54:20.360]  going to raise your taxes up to 80%. France, it's now at 100%. Reuters is reporting. I'm
[54:20.360 --> 54:25.720]  not joking, 100%. But then it turned out all the socialists were exempt and had Swiss bank
[54:25.720 --> 54:32.160]  accounts. They are robbers. Robbers will take everything you've got and your life for fun.
[54:32.160 --> 54:37.080]  They've already robbed you? I'll go ahead and shoot you, boom, because they like it.
[54:37.080 --> 54:42.720]  It's what they like to do. Now there's Skype cut out. We're trying to reconnect right now.
[54:42.720 --> 54:48.600]  And as soon as we get them, we'll get them back on. But the whole point is that if they
[54:48.600 --> 54:53.040]  arrested him for even the marijuana, I'd say, okay, it'll be fought out in court.
[54:53.040 --> 54:56.200]  But I mean, he's not even smoking marijuana and he's giving a speech and they go and grab
[54:56.200 --> 55:01.520]  him, tackle him, and then disappear him. I mean, this is a big deal. At G20, we got footage
[55:01.520 --> 55:06.060]  of them just grabbing peaceful protesters and disappearing them. By the way, it's more
[55:06.060 --> 55:11.520]  important than ever. I'm going to fight 110%. I want you to help us.

[56:13.840 --> 56:18.800]  operation. There's partners in that. Finishing up, get out with a laptop if you can or finish
[56:18.800 --> 56:23.960]  any points you want to make about this political prisoner, Adam Kokesh and the other fellow.
[56:23.960 --> 56:29.720]  We have the phone numbers, all the details at Infowars.com. And make any other points
[56:29.720 --> 56:33.400]  you want as you show viewers shots of the federal gulag.
[56:33.400 --> 56:40.100]  Yeah, Darrell is secure in the vehicle right now. We're right outside of the federal detention
[56:40.100 --> 56:49.040]  center here in Philly. There it is. I'm gonna come up to the door and show you more stuff.
[56:49.040 --> 56:52.640]  Man, I almost jaywalked in front of a cop.
[56:52.640 --> 56:54.160]  My gosh, you're so evil.
[56:54.160 --> 56:56.200]  What a criminal. Fuck it.
[56:56.200 --> 57:01.120]  Blink that. Try not to cuss, man. It's really hard for us to cut that out.
[57:01.120 --> 57:10.160]  I apologize, Alex. You see here, I don't know if you can see in the camera. So this is where
[57:10.160 --> 57:19.400]  he's being held. Federal detention center in Philly. So we walk across here. This is
[57:19.400 --> 57:24.800]  where we were yesterday. We were bullhorning. We were causing quite a stir. We were actually
[57:24.800 --> 57:30.800]  bullhorning these front doors here. Not a lot of traffic coming in and out.
[57:30.800 --> 57:33.800]  My gosh, but you know if you were by yourself, they'd come over and say you're not allowed
[57:33.800 --> 57:38.800]  to videotape and threaten to arrest you for terrorism. Molly Rogers, one of our crew members
[57:38.800 --> 57:43.240]  a few months ago. And then once you come and confront them, they go, there is no law. We
[57:43.240 --> 57:44.240]  apologize.
[57:44.240 --> 57:51.760]  In fact, step back from the laptop. Give us all a wide shot of the facility, please.
[57:51.760 --> 57:53.760]  See what we have here.
[57:53.760 --> 57:59.560]  Absolutely. So somewhere in there, we believe Adam is being held by the goons who can't
[57:59.560 --> 58:02.280]  even put his name right in the computer.
[58:02.280 --> 58:08.960]  And then, correct. And here we have a couple of guardians of the Emperor here. Allegedly,
[58:08.960 --> 58:10.440]  we're not supposed to be standing where I'm standing.
[58:10.440 --> 58:13.320]  Oh yeah, show me the guardians of the Emperor.
[58:13.320 --> 58:19.120]  Here we are. We have a couple of police officers here. Obviously afraid of the camera because
[58:19.120 --> 58:21.440]  you know, good deeds are done in light, Alex.
[58:21.440 --> 58:23.760]  So show us. Yeah, keep it going.
[58:23.760 --> 58:27.280]  Here we are. We got, you know, the bald guy. He's not afraid.
[58:27.280 --> 58:33.520]  Show us the bald guy. Oh, look, he's got a badge. He's God. Hey, that badge only means
[58:33.520 --> 58:37.200]  something if you're lawful. Hey, by the way, stay there back in one minute. I want to go
[58:37.200 --> 58:44.160]  up and talk to the cops. We'll be right back.
[58:44.160 --> 58:46.840]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:46.840 --> 58:51.000]  The Mordor Guardians. Take your shots.
[58:51.000 --> 58:55.720]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms. But if you don't have a home security
[58:55.720 --> 59:00.480]  system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection. When

[59:55.760 --> 01:00:10.120]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You
[01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:18.560]  want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live
[01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:26.480]  from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. So the feds, and the federal government's not even federal,
[01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:29.960]  it's occupied by the globalists, came over and told them they couldn't be filming in
[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:36.880]  front of the God Center, the house of our owners, the federal foreign banker minions.
[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:47.320]  Adam Kokesh was arrested for a speech he gave, a peaceful speech in Philadelphia. And now,
[01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:52.720]  his producers are out there. They have a laptop with live video feed Skype, and they won't
[01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:58.800]  say why he's been arrested. He's disappeared. The full details are at infowars.com. Let's
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:02.280]  go live to that video feed right now before their laptop dies. It's almost out of batteries.
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:11.760]  Here we go. We're live here right in front of the FTC, Philly. It's me and Daryl. And
[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:15.720]  we have these two gentlemen. Actually, now it's three. The bald head guy came back. We
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:22.740]  have these three gentlemen who are here in silly costumes to prevent us from freely moving
[01:01:22.740 --> 01:01:29.760]  our bodies. So what are the guys in costumes doing? Maybe you'd do what they said. They're
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:36.480]  wearing Star Trek costumes. I'm sorry. Hey, hey, try to tip the camera down. Give us a
[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:43.600]  full shot. There we go. What are they doing? Blocking you? What's he doing? Well, Alex,
[01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:47.100]  I had to waste the taxpayers' money. You know the rest. I have some military experience
[01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:52.240]  in the Youth of Force Continuum. The first step in the Youth of Force Continuum is presence.
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:56.120]  So I believe they're establishing a presence to try to intimidate activists from coming
[01:01:56.120 --> 01:02:01.560]  out here and causing a ruckus like we did yesterday. Here, show us the bald headed guy.
[01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:10.320]  Pan these guys. I hope his Skype hasn't cut out. Well, good job, guys. So I mean, they've
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:16.960]  disappeared and drug Kokesh off into a spider hole. They're in there working for the globalists.
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:21.120]  This is the government that publicly ships in almost all the narcotics, runs the opium
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:27.120]  fields in Afghanistan. And they've got some kind of gait, it looks like, out there trying
[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:32.320]  to block you guys from standing in front of the spider hole. And people need to go to
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:36.920]  mfallwars.com, get the article. Activists rally to free Adam Kokesh. I'm gonna have
[01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:37.920]  Paul Watson.
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:42.360]  Will you guys IM Paul Watson, that federal filing? Yeah, IM him that link, and we'll
[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:46.600]  have that screenshotted and put in there. And they can't even get that he's 31. They
[01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:51.240]  have that he's 41. He's white, but at least they got that right. Maybe they'll say he's
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:56.040]  black next. And it's unknown why you guys in the federal government are so evil. That's
[01:02:56.040 --> 01:03:06.160]  what's unknown. It's unbelievable. I tell you, Adam Kokesh, he's like the good linen.
[01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:12.280]  He kinda looks like linen or something. I'm sorry. Linen was reborn and reincarnated as
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:16.120]  Adam Kokesh, but now he's an anarchist instead of a communist. All right, I'm gonna stop.
[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:22.600]  I'm gonna stop. The whole point is that Adam does look a little sinister. I think that's
[01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:27.660]  what makes the cops even more angry cuz they always try to look like that too.
[01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:33.200]  But we're gonna be covering all of this, ladies and gentlemen. Me, I'm a big, sweet teddy
[01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:40.660]  bear. And that's what I could grow a goatee though. Maybe shave my head, everybody like
[01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:47.520]  that. All right, man, we're gonna go to break. We lost those guys. This is only going to
[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:51.440]  intensify the awakening in this country.
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:56.280]  And if they ever disappear me into one of these spider holes, no, that's our victory.
[01:03:56.280 --> 01:04:00.480]  And just continue moving forward, because there are a bunch of people that are scared
[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:04.480]  following their unconstitutional orders. And that's why they're scared of his armed march
[01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:08.720]  on Washington, peaceful, to demonstrate the Second Amendment. They're scared of the idea
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:12.120]  that even if they provocateur, that's going to come out.
[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:17.080]  And they understand that they're trying to dominate us right now and break our will,
[01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:22.440]  and set the precedent that we have no basic liberty. And it's all coming out that we do
[01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:26.560]  have a tyranny, and so people are now having that choice. Like, okay, we're in a tyranny,
[01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:28.800]  now what do we do about it?
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:34.080]  And either people will acquiesce to it, we'll go into a very long, dark time, or people
[01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:43.000]  will start non-compliance across the board everywhere. And their video feed cut out,
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:47.440]  but call their cell phone, give them our hotline, guys. If they have any problems out there,
[01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:49.520]  tell them to call in during the show today, okay?
[01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:53.400]  And we got a bunch of guests. We got an Air Force chem trail whistleblower about him spraying
[01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:58.200]  poison on you and your family coming up, and Joel Skousen in studio. And we got a ton of
[01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:00.640]  the latest IRS impeachment news.

[01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:12.160]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:16.680]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states
[01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:22.260]  on earth. This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps
[01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:27.720]  now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program
[01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:32.480]  has established an all powerful shadow state. Police state four chronicles the sickening

[01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:05.960]  There's been a disaster and most of you don't even realize the terrible danger we're in.
[01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:10.360]  Alex Jones has warned you for years to get a good food storage. We thought the danger
[01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:16.200]  was drought or food delivered to our gas tanks or our food sold to other countries or food
[01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:21.160]  so expensive that only those on food stamps and welfare could afford it. But we have just
[01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:25.920]  experienced the most effective way to lose your freedom, liberty and security without
[01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:32.580]  even a fight. Government regulation. After a 160 year tradition of self-reliance, the
[01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:36.920]  do-it-yourself and charitable Mormon food storage canneries in half the country are
[01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:43.720]  forced to shut down due to excessive government regulations. Grow your own food, more regulations.
[01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:50.000]  If you've ever been warned to get food while you can, this is it. Call 800-409-5633 or
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:57.840]  on the web, efoodsdirect.com slash Alex. That's 800-409-5633 or on the web, efoodsdirect.com
[01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:05.520]  slash Alex.
[01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:14.800]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:35.680]  on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:44.040]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live. Thank you so much for joining us on
[01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:51.400]  this Monday edition. We're now into the second hour. We have just masses of news that I'm
[01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:57.000]  gonna get to in detail right now. I haven't even gotten into our top stories in detail
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.000]  yet.
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:02.980]  The London Guardian and even the Associated Press officially are saying we're in a police
[01:09:02.980 --> 01:09:08.600]  state and that the press is being intimidated. They are arresting members of the State Department
[01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:14.360]  who just give their opinion to a journalist about how dangerous Kim Jong-un is. That's
[01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:19.680]  totally protected. The Espionage Act is giving secrets to a foreign power.
[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:24.600]  Everything the federal government does, selling out to globalist Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan,
[01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:30.240]  the private Federal Reserve that's European-owned, saying NATO's over our military. The Army
[01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:35.180]  has come out and said they don't need presidential authorization to quell unrest. And this is
[01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:41.440]  all unprecedented treason. And then Fox News goes over to the State Department, I mean,
[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:45.080]  openly talk to people, it's not even hidden.
[01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:50.480]  And they're surveilling people in the State Department that talk to Fox News. I mean,
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:56.280]  what do you think goes on in Washington? What do you think reporters do? And they're now
[01:09:56.280 --> 01:10:01.160]  talking about arresting him, saying he's a criminal. I mean, these people aren't playing
[01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:05.540]  games, they may march out and try to arrest us all.
[01:10:05.540 --> 01:10:10.040]  And that set the point, folks, where the civil disobedience has to go, you have to hit the
[01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:17.200]  streets nationwide, aggressively. And then if they put it down with force, 1776 kicks
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:21.680]  in. And I've done everything I can to stop this, but they start trying to arrest the
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:27.920]  press in mass and put us in the reeducation centers that are in the official Army manual.
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:32.280]  That is offensive oppression, and we have every constitutional right to defend ourselves.
[01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:36.040]  I don't wanna go there, and I've tried my hardest, but they know they're losing the
[01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:42.000]  political battle with us. They're gonna start something, they're gonna start something.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:49.480]  And by the way, you're gonna lose that too, punks. But listen, I don't have a bunch of
[01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:54.240]  bravada, I'm not looking for trouble.
[01:10:54.240 --> 01:11:00.180]  But if it starts, ladies and gentlemen, they started it. And if they mean to get a war,
[01:11:00.180 --> 01:11:05.880]  they're gonna get one. There's only so much we're gonna take from these people. There's
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:09.480]  the old saying that you can do you know what to me, but you can't rub it in. And they're
[01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:11.840]  just in our faces, you're rubbing it in.
[01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:15.840]  But we're winning because we just sit back while they race around committing all these
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:22.080]  crimes and we expose them. And they get away with more and more and more. And I believe
[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:29.080]  the false flag is going to be going around and staging events to blame it on the liberty
[01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:37.000]  movement or staging something and saying that media leakers caused the terrorists to attack
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.640]  or something.
[01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:43.880]  And by the way, the White House is listening right now. Their operations, their transition
[01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:49.680]  director running media matters, they're listening, they admit they listen every day. But the
[01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:54.760]  White House itself is listening. And why are they listening? Cuz they know, I know what
[01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:55.760]  they're doing.
[01:11:55.760 --> 01:12:01.040]  I'm the detective, full time on their butt, who knows who they are, knows how they think,
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:04.880]  and knows how to stop them. And I freak them out. And by the way, I freak them out because
[01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:12.440]  I'm committed unto death to not stop. I have the spirit of 1776 in me, and I do not fear
[01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:13.440]  them.
[01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:18.160]  They can kill me, kill my family. People ask Alex, why don't you have security? Alex, why
[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:22.600]  don't you, why aren't you more paranoid? Why don't you wear a bulletproof vest? Because
[01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:29.860]  if they strike me down, it's God's will. I am not going to sit here and live in fear.
[01:12:29.860 --> 01:12:35.780]  My fear is having 30 people banging on the door a day where I can't get my job done.
[01:12:35.780 --> 01:12:40.440]  My fear is not being articulate enough. My fear is not getting the job done. My fear
[01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:46.880]  is not beating these people. My life has zero value outside of a free society.
[01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:50.920]  I love life, and I never wanna die, and I never commit suicide. If they kill me and
[01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:57.280]  say it was suicide, it's pure bull, folks. But I'll say this, if we don't beat them,
[01:12:57.280 --> 01:13:04.280]  life is not going to be worth living. You understand that? I'm not gonna sit here and
[01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:11.280]  watch my children go into hot bondage, not Cold War bondage, but hot enslavement, a war,
[01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:13.640]  a hot war.
[01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:22.280]  And I'm not gonna go out violently and oppose them unless they're shooting at me. Because
[01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:26.840]  that's not effective, that's when you're losing, is when you're in the shooting war. I will
[01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:33.200]  pull out all sorts of tricks before I'm dead to attack these people politically and hurt
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:34.440]  them with the truth.
[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:39.160]  And folks, we've got the truth, we need to stab them with it. Not worry about who's won
[01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:44.000]  in the fight, not worry about what's going on, just stab, stab, stab. And folks, if we
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:48.140]  all just start stabbing with the truth, this sucker will bleed out real quick, death by
[01:13:48.140 --> 01:13:49.400]  a billion cuts.
[01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:55.200]  So start shoving the knife in, ladies and gentlemen. Info war is 90% of warfare, the
[01:13:55.200 --> 01:14:00.880]  Pentagon's own words. We have the truth, the globalists have lies. Savage them, destroy
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:06.600]  them. All you guys talk about a shooting war and how they keep pushing it, you're gonna
[01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:07.600]  go out and do all this.
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:13.360]  Folks, you've lost, we'll end up winning that war, but that's a major failure, a huge failure.
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:20.960]  We wanna beat them with the info war, that's the 90% of the war, it is violence. I have
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:26.280]  been successful because I am violent with the truth. In fact, I'm not violent enough,
[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:28.280]  my crew is not violent enough.
[01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:33.920]  These people are violently attacking our liberty, violently robbing our freedom, violently bankrupting
[01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:39.620]  our country, violently using our name for all their evil operations, violently trying
[01:14:39.620 --> 01:14:49.080]  to intimidate us. They are an outrage, they are an abomination. They are a fraud, they
[01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:54.640]  are a despicable joke. Put it back on screen, yeah, there's the info wars.com headline with
[01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:59.520]  links to her Council on Foreign Relations speech, where she said we are losing the info
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:01.520]  war.
[01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:07.760]  Yes, witch, we are finding our human spirit again. We're finding the righteous spirit
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:13.480]  to not even hate you but be disgusted by you and just be animated with energy to pull you
[01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:18.480]  down. It's a battle of spirit, ladies and gentlemen, and they're trying to kill the
[01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:20.280]  human spirit.
[01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:24.840]  They're waging war against the human spirit because only the dumb will go along with all
[01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:29.580]  this idiocy. It's elementary, these are the most selfish people in the world. I am not
[01:15:29.580 --> 01:15:34.760]  even worried about my own life. I am in love with humanity. I am in love with your success.
[01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:40.640]  I am in love with everything you've done, the paintings, the art, the literature. I
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:45.960]  don't get jealous when some guy's got a gorgeous wife. I admire that. That's the spirit that
[01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:49.320]  builds civilizations, and you've got that spirit too.
[01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:54.640]  These people have the opposite spirit. They are envious and jealous, and they don't like
[01:15:54.640 --> 01:16:02.680]  you. They, it's painful to them the beauty, the goodness, the purity, the creativity,
[01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:07.760]  the love, the compassion, the empathy. It's painful to them because they've turned to
[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:14.600]  darkness out of their single drive to be in a position of power.
[01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:21.720]  There is no future without this species on this planet. I mean, it is beyond insane how
[01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:29.280]  beautiful the universe it is. It is beyond unimaginable that we, I say this, we're on
[01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:35.840]  a planet with a thin atmosphere, spinning through space around a gas giant, and we can
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:41.480]  stare out into space and see other planets, and there's just life all around us.
[01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:46.920]  I was swimming in the river the other night after I went for a jog, and it had already,
[01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:54.560]  the sun had gone down, but over the planet, pink light was hitting. Pink light was hitting
[01:16:54.560 --> 01:17:00.320]  the clouds, and I was in like 15 foot of water going down and picking up rocks in crystal
[01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:04.280]  clear water in a spring feeding out the Colorado River.
[01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:10.080]  You're not supposed to swim in there. I do whatever I want. I'm not your slave. I wasn't
[01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:13.720]  playing your video games then. I wasn't on the computer then. I was in a river with big
[01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:21.120]  snapping turtles and fish all around me, and I saw waves of pink from the waves above me,
[01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:29.480]  and I came up out of the water, and there were bats, and there were skylarks and chimney
[01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:35.560]  swifts flying around eating bugs everywhere, and I saw a big owl fly by, and I was just
[01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:42.400]  sitting there in just absolute awe of the universe, and it's that stillness.
[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:51.680]  It's that wholeness. It was looking up into the sky, the pink sky. It was heaven. It was
[01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:56.840]  heaven. They can't take that away from any of us. They feed off our fear. Well, I'm not
[01:17:56.840 --> 01:18:06.440]  afraid of you. I'm not afraid anymore. I'm only afraid that we fail. I'm only afraid
[01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:07.440]  that you not be defeated.
[01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:14.800]  I mean, I look at giggling children with discovery in their eyes and love, and I think about
[01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:18.400]  how they want to hurt them and brainwash them and turn them into evil people and want to
[01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:22.960]  shoot them up with deadly vaccines and want to feed them GMO designed to sterilize them
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:30.240]  and give them cancer, and it's a feeling beyond rage now of just the evil of it, the evil
[01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:37.800]  force that drives that, that the globalists look at giggling children and see them as
[01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:45.200]  the larva of an infestation upon the face of the world that they must exterminate.
[01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:49.600]  They get a thrill out of it knowing that we don't know, knowing that we're simple minded,
[01:18:49.600 --> 01:19:01.280]  knowing that we were not simple minded. The fool on the hill sees the world going by.
[01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:06.720]  The fool on the hill sees the world spinning around, and the eyes in his head see the sun
[01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:20.800]  going down. The fool on the hill keeps perfectly still. That's still place. That's infinity.
[01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:31.240]  That's forever. That's a moment in forever. We live forever. And you go back to all your
[01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:36.840]  ancestors screaming out in your instincts who resist this dehumanization, screaming
[01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:42.740]  and saying, Do you know what we did to get you to this level? Do you know everything
[01:19:42.740 --> 01:19:48.600]  we put on the line? Screaming through your genetics, screaming through your soul, saying,
[01:19:48.600 --> 01:20:01.560]  Do something! Awaken! Sleeper! Awaken! Sleeper! Awaken! Awaken! Rise, sleeping giant! Rise!
[01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:05.960]  There's been a disaster and most of you don't even realize the terrible danger we're in.
[01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:10.360]  Alex Jones has warned you for years to get a good food storage. We thought the danger
[01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:15.760]  was drought, or food delivered to our gas tanks, or our food sold to other countries,
[01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:20.660]  or food so expensive that only those on food stamps and welfare could afford it. But we
[01:20:20.660 --> 01:20:25.520]  have just experienced the most effective way to lose your freedom, liberty and security
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:32.480]  without even a fight. Government regulation. After a 160 year tradition of self-reliance,
[01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:36.920]  the do-it-yourself and charitable Mormon food storage canneries in half the country are
[01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:43.600]  forced to shut down due to excessive government regulations. Grow your own food, more regulations.
[01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:50.000]  If you've ever been warned to get food while you can, this is it. Call 800-409-5633 or

[01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:08.240]  don't taste that good, have artificial flavors, sweeteners or unhealthy sugars. About a year
[01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:12.920]  ago I was introduced to a new protein powder that changed my experience. This protein powder
[01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:18.080]  made me feel noticeably better and it tasted more delicious than any drink I've ever had.
[01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:22.560]  Here's the experience of one satisfied user named Rich. The term best of all worlds has
[01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:27.160]  been belabored to death and yet I've just discovered a whey protein powder that truly
[01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:33.800]  deserves to be called best of all worlds. Best taste by far. Best results by far. You
[01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:38.240]  almost feel like you're cheating that something that tastes that good could be so good for
[01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:44.320]  you. Thank you Steven and Cocoon Nutrition. One World Whey truly is the best of all worlds.
[01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:54.320]  The only way for me. Yours truly, Rich from Georgia. Real user, real happy. Call 888-988-3325

[01:22:39.740 --> 01:22:43.600]  or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater
[01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:47.240]  menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army. Hi, Ted Anderson. I'm placing

[01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:05.000]  Bollinger, author of the bestselling book Cancer Step Outside the Box. I want you to
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:11.160]  know some very important information. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora
[01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:15.120]  be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this

[01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:23.040]  It's the only one you've got.
[01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:31.640]  It's like it always is. We're back live, finishing up the story about being in the river the
[01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:36.080]  other night, right where the extreme of spring water was coming in. It was crystal clear
[01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:41.400]  it had gotten dark, but there was still clouds way up high where the sun was shooting over
[01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:47.640]  the planet. And I'd never seen, I'd seen pink on the water. This was like 10, 15 feet down.
[01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:54.100]  There was rivulets of the water with the pink. So the marks of the waves, it's like you see
[01:24:54.100 --> 01:24:59.800]  in the daytime gold on the bottom of the water. Well, this was pink and purple on the bottom
[01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:06.060]  of the river, on the stones, on the pebbles with fish and things swimming around reflected
[01:25:06.060 --> 01:25:07.060]  by the sun.
[01:25:07.060 --> 01:25:12.220]  Just, just amazing. Imagine a sun in space shooting over the edge of the planet, hitting
[01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:19.640]  clouds beaming down into the water. I mean, it's just, it's just incredible. Creation
[01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:27.880]  is incredible. Being alive is a blessing. And the evil hates it and wants to destroy
[01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:32.440]  it. I mean, you can call it what you want, but it's a very small percentage of the population
[01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:36.040]  loves ugliness.
[01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:40.620]  And it's gotta be dealt with. Speaking of that, the Washington Post actually did a pretty
[01:25:40.620 --> 01:25:47.680]  fair article. Has Adam Kokesh been kidnapped by the feds? Alex Jones tells all. And the
[01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:57.280]  writer actually does a pretty fair and balanced, I would say, report. And she says at the end
[01:25:57.280 --> 01:26:04.000]  of the report, it doesn't matter if Kokesh is a good guy or a bad guy, he's had his rights
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:07.200]  violated for speaking.
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:10.840]  Adam Kokesh has had his civil and political rights, just like every other American. The
[01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:15.120]  government appears to have infringed on those rights targeting Kokesh because of his anti-government
[01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:20.440]  views. And that's a liberal saying that. See, I mean, it gets to a point, folks, where we
[01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:24.880]  either stand up for the press and we either stand up for freedom, we either stand up for
[01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:26.640]  rights or everybody loses them.
[01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:30.600]  I mean, look at this. Look at this article by Kurt Nemo up on infoawards.com. We have
[01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:36.400]  a newscast that goes with this, we're about to play. Denver cops arrest Italian shotgun
[01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:40.560]  manufacturer as a terrorist. And he was at the Colorado Gun Collector Show. I'm not even
[01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:47.760]  a collector of really fancy shotguns, but I know who Daniele Perazzi shotguns are, and
[01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:49.760]  they're selling them.
[01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:54.160]  And he's the executive who was there showing them to gun shops to sell. And these are the
[01:26:54.160 --> 01:27:01.160]  fancy shotguns that rich people use. And the cab driver called the police on him as part
[01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:07.400]  of a terrorism program called Taxis on Patrol, TOPS, where they just gave awards to him.
[01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:10.440]  And yeah, if somebody's getting in the car saying I'm gonna go kidnap kids or somebody's
[01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:13.040]  a crack dealer, but the cops won't respond to that.
[01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:16.800]  And I can go show them crack dealers here in Austin right now. But they did respond
[01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:20.840]  to this and arrested him, even though the guns weren't illegal and he had all the licenses
[01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:25.080]  to bring them in and said, get out of Colorado. And he said, forget that, I'm getting out
[01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:26.680]  of the United States.
[01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:32.360]  Man, those shotguns are even allowed in Italy and they've taken most of the guns. So let's
[01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:36.000]  go ahead and go to a piece of this newscast. But when you have a cleaner in your house
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:45.580]  or you have a repair person, a lot of them make more money on kickbacks for tips than
[01:27:45.580 --> 01:27:47.520]  they do on their job.
[01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:52.440]  And you need to know America is like East Germany now. And they're hungry for new people.
[01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:55.920]  They're hungry for folks that haven't done anything wrong, cuz the cops won't go after
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:59.360]  the real criminals. They're not allowed to. They can't go after their own cocaine dealers.
[01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:01.360]  Let's go ahead and go to this clip.
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:06.760]  A taxi driver called police claiming he just dropped off a terrorist at a gun show. Turns
[01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:11.460]  out the man wasn't who the cab driver thought. Fox 31, Denver's Hendrix O'Brandy is here
[01:28:11.460 --> 01:28:12.460]  with this developing story.
[01:28:12.460 --> 01:28:15.320]  It's not a very good place to go attack people at a gun show.
[01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:19.960]  We've been instructed to report any suspicious activity. When in doubt, we're told call the
[01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:20.960]  police.
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:21.960]  We've been instructed.
[01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:25.800]  That's exactly what a cabbie did today after he dropped off a man carrying a bunch of weapons
[01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:31.460]  at a local gun show. It took a police interrogation determined that the man, who's the grandson
[01:28:31.460 --> 01:28:34.680]  of a prominent Italian gun maker, was totally legit.
[01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:37.480]  Those guns cost 10 grand apiece.
[01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:42.640]  It was around noon today when a taxi driver picked up a fare who was carrying seven expensive
[01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:43.640]  shotguns.
[01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:44.640]  Oh my gosh.
[01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:48.860]  He dropped the customer off at the merchandise mart at a Colorado Gun Collectors Association
[01:28:48.860 --> 01:28:49.860]  gun show.
[01:28:49.860 --> 01:28:50.860]  Oh, that's not obvious.
[01:28:50.860 --> 01:28:53.760]  A cabbie then called police saying he just dropped off a terrorist.
[01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:54.760]  Oh.
[01:28:54.760 --> 01:28:59.400]  Police came, took the gun toting man in for questioning, then released him when they realized
[01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:01.260]  he'd done nothing wrong.
[01:29:01.260 --> 01:29:07.660]  The man is the grandson of the founder of Porazzi, an Italian maker of competition shotguns.
[01:29:07.660 --> 01:29:12.560]  Former Vice President Dick Cheney was reportedly using a Porazzi shotgun when he accidentally
[01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:15.800]  shot a friend back in 2006.
[01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:19.240]  Just this week, Denver taxi driver got this reminder.
[01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:21.600]  If you see something, say something.
[01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:23.560]  Well, I see a corrupt government out of control.
[01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:29.800]  Folks, these are single shot and double shot carved shotguns, but that shows how dumb the
[01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:30.800]  public are.
[01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:36.360]  I told you, I had the carpet cleaner call the cops on me 15 years ago for a gun case
[01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:39.200]  and he'd moved here from a state where guns were pretty much illegal.
[01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:40.200]  And I said, listen, it's okay.
[01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:42.400]  And he ran out in fear from a gun case.
[01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:50.120]  I mean, that's how you got us normal, informed people and then armies of mindless idiot zombies.
[01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:53.800]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:57.960]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:29:57.960 --> 01:30:06.240]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our
[01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:08.280]  immunity and health.

[01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:07.000]  With health threats on the rise such as West Nile virus, MRSA, CRE, and now the new bird

[01:33:18.440 --> 01:33:19.440]  us here in a minute.
[01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:20.440]  This is big.
[01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:25.880]  Please tell your friends and family to tune in and the whole next hour, we're going to
[01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:31.360]  be talking with Joel Skalzen in studio about all the big scandals and what he thinks is
[01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:32.360]  behind them.
[01:33:32.360 --> 01:33:38.720]  We're gonna go over IRS gate, spy gate, Benghazi gate, where he thinks the whole power structure
[01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:39.720]  is right now.
[01:33:39.720 --> 01:33:43.200]  So we're gonna be looking at that with him.
[01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:48.440]  We're also going to look at some other issues tonight on the Nightly News.
[01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:55.460]  We're gonna look at what strategic relocation means, region by region, and what the elites
[01:33:55.460 --> 01:33:59.180]  are doing, why they're digging in and saying they're getting ready for total collapse and
[01:33:59.180 --> 01:34:00.180]  civil unrest.
[01:34:00.180 --> 01:34:05.400]  We're gonna have Joel Skalzen on the Nightly News for a lengthy interview tonight.
[01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:09.280]  He's here to be interviewed for Obama Deception 2 that should be out in the fall that I'm
[01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:11.280]  working on right now.
[01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:20.060]  Now, before we go to our guest, I just briefly want to remind all of the listeners and viewers
[01:34:20.060 --> 01:34:24.900]  that the entire Infowars operation is a creature of your doing.

[01:35:46.340 --> 01:36:01.340]  Okay, all right, ladies and gentlemen, again, we are gonna get our guest on here in just
[01:36:01.340 --> 01:36:02.340]  a moment.
[01:36:02.340 --> 01:36:03.500]  Her Skype just dropped.
[01:36:03.500 --> 01:36:07.780]  Again, coming up in the next hour, I'm gonna get into some of these reports.
[01:36:07.780 --> 01:36:16.820]  Obama's backed FSA rebels name their brigade Osama bin Laden, and it shows videos on our
[01:36:16.820 --> 01:36:26.420]  site of brigades of thousands of men marching in Al-Qaeda black uniforms with Al-Qaeda
[01:36:26.420 --> 01:36:29.320]  patches and the official Al-Qaeda flag.
[01:36:29.320 --> 01:36:32.460]  That is the main public force, it has been the entire time.
[01:36:32.460 --> 01:36:34.920]  Now it's all over mainstream news.
[01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:39.300]  While they simultaneously say, and I'll show people a document cam shot of their TV viewers
[01:36:39.300 --> 01:36:47.700]  of this, Obama backed FSA rebels name their brigade Osama bin Laden.
[01:36:47.700 --> 01:36:49.980]  And then it continues here.
[01:36:49.980 --> 01:36:56.340]  Here is a article, Washington gets explicit, its war on terror is permanent.
[01:36:56.340 --> 01:36:59.860]  Cheney said it would last 100 years, now it's permanent.
[01:36:59.860 --> 01:37:00.860]  Next will be infinity.
[01:37:00.860 --> 01:37:06.900]  A senior Obama official tells the US Senate, the war is limitless, form will continue,
[01:37:06.900 --> 01:37:08.780]  or at least another decade or two.
[01:37:08.780 --> 01:37:14.060]  And of course, the main enemy is conservatives, libertarians, returning veterans.
[01:37:14.060 --> 01:37:25.660]  Think of the magnitude, think of the magnitude of that statement that, yeah, it's not Al-Qaeda
[01:37:25.660 --> 01:37:27.380]  now, it's you.
[01:37:27.380 --> 01:37:32.340]  It's for you, you're the suspect and we're gonna audit and harass churches and pro-life
[01:37:32.340 --> 01:37:33.340]  groups.
[01:37:33.340 --> 01:37:36.500]  And we're gonna not let you have protest, we're not even gonna have free speech zones
[01:37:36.500 --> 01:37:37.500]  now.
[01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:39.340]  And we're gonna arrest you if you videotape the police.
[01:37:39.340 --> 01:37:43.580]  I have more articles about it happening all over the US right here.
[01:37:43.580 --> 01:37:47.820]  This is lawlessness that we are seeing unfold.
[01:37:47.820 --> 01:37:54.740]  And look at this, Obama backed FSA rebel names their brigade Osama bin Laden.
[01:37:54.740 --> 01:38:00.820]  Here's another one, Marines growing use of ground robots raises ethics concerns.
[01:38:00.820 --> 01:38:05.620]  Yeah, cuz soon it's gonna be totally autonomous, they already have them and humans are out
[01:38:05.620 --> 01:38:06.620]  of the equation.
[01:38:06.620 --> 01:38:09.620]  They will follow orders, the robots.
[01:38:09.620 --> 01:38:12.260]  Now there are stealth drone boats, this has already been announced, they're gonna have
[01:38:12.260 --> 01:38:14.060]  them on all lakes.
[01:38:14.060 --> 01:38:19.660]  Lethal remote vessels will take on pirates, see the globalists are going to all robots.
[01:38:19.660 --> 01:38:25.300]  Al Qaeda Syrian wing takes over oil fields once belonging to Assad.
[01:38:25.300 --> 01:38:31.620]  Al Qaeda Syrian wing is helping to finance its activities by selling the product of oil
[01:38:31.620 --> 01:38:35.940]  fields that once helped to prop up the regime of Bashir Al Assad.
[01:38:35.940 --> 01:38:41.740]  I mean, that's London Telegraph folks, one of the biggest papers in England.
[01:38:41.740 --> 01:38:47.220]  But when I fly to Bilderberg, I guarantee you, when you leave the country, they're gonna
[01:38:47.220 --> 01:38:51.140]  have a see something, say something where some idiot that's taking a six hour course
[01:38:51.140 --> 01:38:54.020]  or eight hour course can ask me questions.
[01:38:54.020 --> 01:38:57.220]  Knowing full well, hello, Mr. Jones, we're gonna ask you some questions.
[01:38:57.220 --> 01:38:59.500]  You're not planning anything, you're not a terrorist, are you?
[01:38:59.500 --> 01:39:02.720]  We're gonna take you over here and grab your genitals, how's that sound?
[01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:09.860]  When the government publicly, do I get apologies from all the neocon talk show host?
[01:39:09.860 --> 01:39:16.020]  Cuz now I've seen them, I've seen the video clips of them going, Obama's running Al Qaeda.
[01:39:16.020 --> 01:39:19.540]  That really freaked the White House out when I came out with a headline a few months ago,
[01:39:19.540 --> 01:39:23.540]  Obama now head of Al Qaeda worldwide, he is.
[01:39:23.540 --> 01:39:31.020]  I mean, that's how insane all of this garbage has gotten.
[01:39:31.020 --> 01:39:37.880]  And it's just gonna get more and more and more and more and more and more crazy.
[01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:44.300]  And I've told the story about the carpet cleaner in my house, sees a gun case and wouldn't
[01:39:44.300 --> 01:39:49.460]  clean the carpets and left and then I called the place saying, is he calling the cops?
[01:39:49.460 --> 01:39:53.420]  Well, yes, but we stopped it, he doesn't understand, he's not from around here.
[01:39:53.420 --> 01:39:57.380]  And these people watch these shows, their parents didn't raise them, they sit in front
[01:39:57.380 --> 01:39:59.700]  of the television, they don't even know what continent they're on, they don't know what
[01:39:59.700 --> 01:40:01.820]  three branches of governments are.
[01:40:01.820 --> 01:40:07.780]  And then they watch shows based in New York, all these dramas where they find a gun and
[01:40:07.780 --> 01:40:10.620]  everybody that has a gun is a bad guy and all guns are illegal.
[01:40:10.620 --> 01:40:14.740]  Hope you've got a handgun, you're gonna go to jail for 20 years for this.
[01:40:14.740 --> 01:40:19.420]  And then I always read the articles where it's always some old vet in a semi-rural area
[01:40:19.420 --> 01:40:21.720]  cleaning guns in their garage.
[01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:27.040]  And the new neighbor sees it, calls the police, they SWAT team them, and it'll say 11 guns
[01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:32.300]  and 1,000 rounds of ammo were taken, he's being charged with having an arsenal.
[01:40:32.300 --> 01:40:36.340]  And then you go check the state law, there's not an arsenal law.
[01:40:36.340 --> 01:40:41.700]  But they got juries that are so dumb that they'll convict them for stuff that doesn't
[01:40:41.700 --> 01:40:42.700]  even exist.
[01:40:42.700 --> 01:40:46.620]  I mean, this country's really weird, man.
[01:40:46.620 --> 01:40:50.960]  And then so you've got the grandson of one of the fanciest, I think not one of, probably
[01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:53.260]  the most fancy shotguns.
[01:40:53.260 --> 01:40:56.220]  I mean, the cheap ones are 10 grand.
[01:40:56.220 --> 01:41:00.060]  I've been to the gun shops, I've looked at them.
[01:41:00.060 --> 01:41:07.140]  And he's there at a major dealer show about dealers, one of the biggest dealer shows in
[01:41:07.140 --> 01:41:09.060]  the country where it's mainly dealers there.
[01:41:09.060 --> 01:41:12.460]  It's like they have trade shows, they're there to see it.
[01:41:12.460 --> 01:41:16.820]  He's there trying to show them there's seven models of shotgun.
[01:41:16.820 --> 01:41:22.540]  And imagine the taxi driver, you load the shotguns in, they're totally legal.
[01:41:22.540 --> 01:41:32.140]  You drive to the conference place, you get out at the gun dealer expo.
[01:41:32.140 --> 01:41:34.340]  He goes in, imagine how dumb you gotta be.
[01:41:34.340 --> 01:41:40.000]  A guy's going to a gun show for gun dealers with seven Italian shotguns that no one would
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:41.660]  use in a terror attack.
[01:41:41.660 --> 01:41:46.140]  And then the guy calls going, they're terrorists.
[01:41:46.140 --> 01:41:49.180]  This is how stupid these people are.
[01:41:49.180 --> 01:41:51.540]  This is how weird they are.
[01:41:51.540 --> 01:41:53.860]  This is how bizarre they are.
[01:41:53.860 --> 01:41:59.900]  And they're invincibly ignorant.
[01:41:59.900 --> 01:42:01.700]  And that's why you're seeing so much tyranny.
[01:42:01.700 --> 01:42:04.860]  That's why they're telling churches, you're gonna tell us what you pray now.
[01:42:04.860 --> 01:42:11.780]  I mean, that's beyond North Korea.
[01:42:11.780 --> 01:42:16.620]  We have a pack of criminals that have taken over with all these servile idiots who call
[01:42:16.620 --> 01:42:17.620]  the police.
[01:42:17.620 --> 01:42:21.060]  If your five year old's throwing a fitness store and you spat them totally legal, they
[01:42:21.060 --> 01:42:22.060]  call the cops.
[01:42:22.060 --> 01:42:26.140]  Then CPS comes, there's no law, but they say, well, we say it's abuse, and then they take
[01:42:26.140 --> 01:42:27.140]  your kid.
[01:42:27.140 --> 01:42:30.340]  We say you didn't vaccinate your kid.
[01:42:30.340 --> 01:42:31.780]  There's no law, we don't care.
[01:42:31.780 --> 01:42:34.980]  We have a judge that'll take your kids in the fake court.
[01:42:34.980 --> 01:42:40.100]  This is what, it's so incredible, because the public are a bunch of jellyfish idiots.
[01:42:40.100 --> 01:42:44.300]  But here's the message of the new world war that we're going to our guests, we got connected.
[01:42:44.300 --> 01:42:46.140]  There's probably 30% of us fully awake.
[01:42:46.140 --> 01:42:51.020]  Just because you've got a bunch of zombies doesn't mean that we are gonna be your slaves.
[01:42:51.020 --> 01:42:52.020]  Scum.
[01:42:52.020 --> 01:42:54.340]  5% beat you in 1776.
[01:42:54.340 --> 01:42:56.400]  Now, we have a major whistleblower.
[01:42:56.400 --> 01:42:58.460]  The video she did is 20 minutes long.
[01:42:58.460 --> 01:43:02.500]  It's on infowars.com with Jakari Jackson Friday night.
[01:43:02.500 --> 01:43:05.320]  She's just recently gone public, given some speeches.
[01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:10.780]  And when I watch her, I'm an expert on geoengineering and chemtrailing from studying it for 15, 16
[01:43:10.780 --> 01:43:11.780]  years.
[01:43:11.780 --> 01:43:15.900]  The actual documents, the engineers, so I know she knows what she's talking about.
[01:43:15.900 --> 01:43:18.260]  She breaks it all down on her YouTube channel.
[01:43:18.260 --> 01:43:23.700]  She spent nine years on active duty in the US Air Force bio environmental engineering.
[01:43:23.700 --> 01:43:24.700]  That's what they call it.
[01:43:24.700 --> 01:43:27.700]  By the way, this is all quasi public, the details are classified.
[01:43:27.700 --> 01:43:34.020]  And when you talk about it, they go, you're crazy, working in industrial hygiene and environmental
[01:43:34.020 --> 01:43:35.020]  protection.
[01:43:35.020 --> 01:43:43.540]  She was, and then it goes through all the things that she's fighting and exposing.
[01:43:43.540 --> 01:43:54.920]  And she joins us now, sugardecodedsanity.com is her website, sugardecoded.com.
[01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:57.460]  And she joins us now, I appreciate her coming on.
[01:43:57.460 --> 01:44:01.540]  Just give us the skinny of it because of time constraints, how you woke up, what you saw
[01:44:01.540 --> 01:44:08.660]  in the Air Force, what's going on with the bio, environmental, it's biological too, engineering.
[01:44:08.660 --> 01:44:13.240]  And because you're one of the few insiders, there's been a couple others.
[01:44:13.240 --> 01:44:16.900]  One of them got shut down and then won't talk to anybody, wouldn't even know where he's
[01:44:16.900 --> 01:44:17.900]  at.
[01:44:17.900 --> 01:44:18.900]  But by the way, tell us what you witnessed.
[01:44:18.900 --> 01:44:20.540]  Thank you, Kristin, Megan, for coming on.
[01:44:20.540 --> 01:44:22.820]  Well, thanks for having me, Alex.
[01:44:22.820 --> 01:44:26.260]  Like I said before, actually, it was your documentary, Terror Storm.
[01:44:26.260 --> 01:44:28.580]  My brother showed it to me back in 06.
[01:44:28.580 --> 01:44:32.540]  I was in the military, completely ignorant to what was really going on and what we were
[01:44:32.540 --> 01:44:33.540]  doing.
[01:44:33.540 --> 01:44:37.340]  That video woke me up, I kind of went through a stage of what's going on, question what
[01:44:37.340 --> 01:44:42.620]  I was doing in the military, and that video ignited me going into researching a lot of
[01:44:42.620 --> 01:44:44.540]  things you were talking about.
[01:44:44.540 --> 01:44:48.500]  And in doing a lot of the research, I came across truther sites, heard about chemtrails
[01:44:48.500 --> 01:44:52.340]  and engineering, thought it was just a crazy conspiracy, and then the light bulb goes off,
[01:44:52.340 --> 01:44:56.420]  hey, if this is going to go on and people are blaming the Air Force, I'm in a good position
[01:44:56.420 --> 01:44:58.220]  to kind of look into this.
[01:44:58.220 --> 01:45:01.740]  So kind of living a secret life while I was in the military, I started to look and try
[01:45:01.740 --> 01:45:02.740]  to debunk this.
[01:45:02.740 --> 01:45:05.300]  It was almost offensive to my lifestyle.
[01:45:05.300 --> 01:45:09.900]  In an attempt to debunk it, like I've said before in my speech, part of the process was
[01:45:09.900 --> 01:45:13.060]  to follow what's called an Air Force form 3952.
[01:45:13.060 --> 01:45:16.540]  It's the approval and authorization that has materials on base.
[01:45:16.540 --> 01:45:21.260]  So I would tie like from benzene, toluene, things like that that were coming on base,
[01:45:21.260 --> 01:45:24.900]  even metal sheets to come on base, we would tie it to a building in a process.
[01:45:24.900 --> 01:45:30.500]  So just to make a long story short, I started seeing the same constituents that were blamed
[01:45:30.500 --> 01:45:38.860]  for chemtrails, and I went, wow, this stuff is coming on base and it's not labeled.
[01:45:38.860 --> 01:45:42.460]  It's normally tied to a building, but you got barium, stromium, aluminum, different
[01:45:42.460 --> 01:45:46.740]  radioactive materials and tiny particulates coming on base, which is usually the same
[01:45:46.740 --> 01:45:51.900]  hazards that we were trying to debate for all the DOD and Air Force personnel.
[01:45:51.900 --> 01:45:57.780]  So I did my own solar sampling, rain sampling, grid sampling, and what I was coming back
[01:45:57.780 --> 01:46:04.300]  with was government reportable and the EPA would not do anything about it.
[01:46:04.300 --> 01:46:07.940]  I hear a radio on in the background, can you do me a favor and turn that down just so I
[01:46:07.940 --> 01:46:08.940]  don't be able to hear you clearly?
[01:46:08.940 --> 01:46:09.940]  Sorry, hold on just a second.
[01:46:09.940 --> 01:46:12.940]  Can you turn off that audio out there, please?
[01:46:12.940 --> 01:46:16.580]  I know everybody wants to listen, but it kind of makes it hard.
[01:46:16.580 --> 01:46:21.940]  Okay, now expanding on this, I mean, they admit the geoengineering, they don't call
[01:46:21.940 --> 01:46:26.380]  it chemtrails, but under the Department of Energy and Air Force, the billions a year
[01:46:26.380 --> 01:46:27.700]  are public.
[01:46:27.700 --> 01:46:33.780]  We just don't have the details, specifically for laymen out there, explain the chemicals
[01:46:33.780 --> 01:46:38.100]  they're using at the Air Force and then what you discovered.
[01:46:38.100 --> 01:46:45.100]  Well, again, what I had seen was materials coming on base and these were completely didn't
[01:46:45.100 --> 01:46:47.740]  label which company they were coming from.
[01:46:47.740 --> 01:46:49.700]  That was a huge red flag for me.
[01:46:49.700 --> 01:46:53.700]  So at the time, you know, fearing replies, I didn't ask the questions, but I thought,
[01:46:53.700 --> 01:46:57.660]  wow, you know, this is a huge indicator to what people are saying.
[01:46:57.660 --> 01:47:03.020]  So again, I lived a mile behind the flight line and I did my own soil and rain sampling
[01:47:03.020 --> 01:47:06.220]  and those same constituents were showing in my soil.
[01:47:06.220 --> 01:47:10.060]  And so people know I am credentialed to understand how to do this type of sampling.
[01:47:10.060 --> 01:47:14.260]  You go and you get your county's background information and you know what's already naturally
[01:47:14.260 --> 01:47:16.540]  occurring in your soil for your state.
[01:47:16.540 --> 01:47:19.860]  And when you have these parameters, these constituents and compounds that I sampled
[01:47:19.860 --> 01:47:23.240]  for, it should not be in the soil.
[01:47:23.240 --> 01:47:25.740]  This was a very scary, scary time for me.
[01:47:25.740 --> 01:47:30.380]  It took me until I left the federal service to actually start talking about it.
[01:47:30.380 --> 01:47:34.840]  And I just hope that more people will come forward that are still in my job or anyone
[01:47:34.840 --> 01:47:39.380]  in my line of work in the federal government as a whole will come forward and talk about
[01:47:39.380 --> 01:47:40.380]  this.
[01:47:40.380 --> 01:47:41.380]  Sure.
[01:47:41.380 --> 01:47:46.180]  And again, this shows the compartmentalization they use until you knew not to trust the system.
[01:47:46.180 --> 01:47:50.840]  You even though you were over environmental procedures there in your area of the base,
[01:47:50.840 --> 01:47:52.460]  you didn't know what to look for.
[01:47:52.460 --> 01:47:57.220]  Talk about the different chemicals and things that were being brought on and the amounts
[01:47:57.220 --> 01:48:00.620]  of it that was being brought on.
[01:48:00.620 --> 01:48:03.740]  Well it was aluminum oxide, barium, and strontium.
[01:48:03.740 --> 01:48:07.420]  And the thing about strontium, in the form of paint, it's a strontium chromate similar
[01:48:07.420 --> 01:48:10.100]  to chromium chrome six, if you've ever heard of that.
[01:48:10.100 --> 01:48:18.460]  So they were coming in like tonnage, I mean, not as solid materials, but as aerosols.
[01:48:18.460 --> 01:48:22.100]  And it's coated by if it's a solid, if it's a liquid, if it's an aerosol.
[01:48:22.100 --> 01:48:27.060]  Exactly what the Chemtrail researchers exposed 15, 16 years ago, yeah, which now all over
[01:48:27.060 --> 01:48:30.700]  the US, the soil's going way up to where plants can't even grow.
[01:48:30.700 --> 01:48:31.700]  Exactly.
[01:48:31.700 --> 01:48:32.700]  Unbelievable.
[01:48:32.700 --> 01:48:35.180]  I mean, the evidence is here on the ground, yes.
[01:48:35.180 --> 01:48:36.820]  Unbelievable, keep going.
[01:48:36.820 --> 01:48:41.420]  And one thing that just blew my mind was I started to kind of talk about this amongst
[01:48:41.420 --> 01:48:44.100]  some of my coworkers and they thought it was crazy.
[01:48:44.100 --> 01:48:46.100]  But I'm always known as being against the fringe.
[01:48:46.100 --> 01:48:52.540]  So just throughout my career, this was around 2007, 2008, even when I moved to Robbins Air
[01:48:52.540 --> 01:48:57.360]  Force Base in Georgia, I didn't see those same materials on system, but those same things
[01:48:57.360 --> 01:49:00.500]  were coming back in my soil and rain samples.
[01:49:00.500 --> 01:49:03.860]  And now that I'm in Chicago, I'm getting the same things.
[01:49:03.860 --> 01:49:08.620]  And actually, when I worked at the VA after leaving the Air Force, I met an EPA compliance
[01:49:08.620 --> 01:49:13.380]  inspector who was actually chastised for bringing this up.
[01:49:13.380 --> 01:49:15.660]  He's a full believer in Chemtrails.
[01:49:15.660 --> 01:49:20.180]  He's seen some things that he is going to talk about when he retires from the EPA.
[01:49:20.180 --> 01:49:26.620]  I mean, they kind of took a 26-year EPA compliance officer who's a GS-13 high ranking and put
[01:49:26.620 --> 01:49:29.380]  them out in the field to kind of shut them up.
[01:49:29.380 --> 01:49:33.740]  So you have people within the EPA who are saying, hey, we know about this and it's a
[01:49:33.740 --> 01:49:35.500]  shut up in color type ordeal.
[01:49:35.500 --> 01:49:38.620]  I've had them on from the EPA and recently retired.
[01:49:38.620 --> 01:49:42.140]  And they talk about in areas of the country because they have, as you know, the soil samples
[01:49:42.140 --> 01:49:43.700]  going back 100 years.
[01:49:43.700 --> 01:49:48.740]  They go, my God, in five years, the aluminum dioxide levels, one person I interviewed in
[01:49:48.740 --> 01:49:51.900]  Washington State, had gone up more than ten times what it was.
[01:49:51.900 --> 01:49:54.980]  I mean, they are just, and you see it everywhere.
[01:49:54.980 --> 01:50:02.940]  The trees are dying, the plants, farm growth belts, I mean, it's almost like aliens that
[01:50:02.940 --> 01:50:04.140]  want to kill the Earth or something.
[01:50:04.140 --> 01:50:07.620]  I mean, I'm not saying they are, it's so diabolical.
[01:50:07.620 --> 01:50:11.960]  What's insane to you, Alex, is the fact that if you're familiar with any time there's removal
[01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:17.780]  of soil, soil remediation, construction, you cannot even haul off soil waste until it's
[01:50:17.780 --> 01:50:18.780]  been tested.
[01:50:18.780 --> 01:50:23.820]  Due to different CFRs, you have to test it for benzene and oil and biologicals.
[01:50:23.820 --> 01:50:28.820]  So when you really start to see how many people can profit off of this whole program, it's
[01:50:28.820 --> 01:50:29.820]  disturbing.
[01:50:29.820 --> 01:50:32.180]  And I actually, now that I'm done with it, I can talk about it.
[01:50:32.180 --> 01:50:38.060]  I've been doing a study pretending to be some student and I've contacted a lot of land disposal
[01:50:38.060 --> 01:50:42.380]  sites here to get copies of their trends and this stuff is everywhere.
[01:50:42.380 --> 01:50:43.380]  Unbelievable.
[01:50:43.380 --> 01:50:45.860]  Stay there and break that news when we get back.
[01:50:45.860 --> 01:50:52.140]  A nine-year veteran of the Air Force over bio-environmental engineering, Kristen Meghan,
[01:50:52.140 --> 01:50:55.800]  she's going to break down this new study she's been doing.
[01:50:55.800 --> 01:50:56.800]  This is incredible.
[01:50:56.800 --> 01:50:59.020]  It's levels of this are exploding everywhere.
[01:50:59.020 --> 01:51:02.340]  Tell her she'll be all right.
[01:51:02.340 --> 01:51:05.940]  Imagine waking one morning only to find your family shivering in the dark because you couldn't
[01:51:05.940 --> 01:51:08.160]  afford to pay your electric bill.
[01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:09.900]  That's closer than you think.
[01:51:09.900 --> 01:51:13.360]  You probably hadn't heard about this yet because the liberal media has been suppressing what
[01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:19.900]  is fast becoming the most shocking news story of 2012, Obama's secret war on coal that could
[01:51:19.900 --> 01:51:24.260]  increase your already high power bill as much as 400% in coming months.
[01:51:24.260 --> 01:51:29.180]  As shocking as it sounds, it may well be just a matter of time before the lights start going
[01:51:29.180 --> 01:51:31.140]  out across America.
[01:51:31.140 --> 01:51:32.580]  But here's some good news.
[01:51:32.580 --> 01:51:38.300]  There's an underground video at Exposed123.com that thousands of smart patriots have used
[01:51:38.300 --> 01:51:41.980]  to end their slavery to the corrupt electricity monopoly.
[01:51:41.980 --> 01:51:47.200]  The video at Exposed123.com has already been banned by Google and the liberal media is
[01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:51.260]  doing everything in its power to take it down and keep America in the dark.
[01:51:51.260 --> 01:51:55.700]  So watch it now at Exposed123.com before it's too late.
[01:51:55.700 --> 01:52:00.660]  Again, that's Exposed123.com.
[01:52:00.660 --> 01:52:02.540]  Great news, pure water lovers.

[01:54:50.620 --> 01:54:55.860]  And here's the deal, there also we found the patents adding aluminum dioxide, barium salts,
[01:54:55.860 --> 01:55:01.340]  and the strontium and things to the jet fuel through the big manufacturers, and then it
[01:55:01.340 --> 01:55:04.820]  aerosolizes it in the engines and puts it out.
[01:55:04.820 --> 01:55:07.980]  Perfect compartmentalization, you have special Air Force teams.
[01:55:07.980 --> 01:55:12.780]  I saw one thing recently, 5 billion for the Department of Energy in this.
[01:55:12.780 --> 01:55:17.420]  There is a huge program, I think I'll ask Joel Skalzen when he comes up in the next
[01:55:17.420 --> 01:55:21.940]  hour what he thinks of this, but Kristen Megan, you're saying, trained in this in the Air
[01:55:21.940 --> 01:55:27.180]  Force, in bio-environmental engineering, working in industrial hygiene, environmental protection,
[01:55:27.180 --> 01:55:31.300]  that you've now been going around and getting samples all over the country, and what are
[01:55:31.300 --> 01:55:34.540]  your findings, and when is this report coming out?
[01:55:34.540 --> 01:55:38.940]  I'm hoping to have it out by the end of July, I've had to be really careful in getting this
[01:55:38.940 --> 01:55:45.500]  information, but I presented myself as a student who was learning about new remediation techniques
[01:55:45.500 --> 01:55:51.580]  by different things as cool locks, new programs for companies, so I wanted to look at different
[01:55:51.580 --> 01:55:54.580]  contaminants that were common in industry.
[01:55:54.580 --> 01:56:00.340]  So I've been able to get a lot of information, this public record, from different sites all
[01:56:00.340 --> 01:56:01.340]  around the country.
[01:56:01.340 --> 01:56:06.220]  I've been doing this for about the last six, seven months, and this was actually just started
[01:56:06.220 --> 01:56:07.220]  out as me personally.
[01:56:07.220 --> 01:56:10.840]  I have a lot of disinformation trolls that attack me, and I'm just trying to give as
[01:56:10.840 --> 01:56:12.980]  much evidence as I can for people to understand that.
[01:56:12.980 --> 01:56:14.380]  Yeah, I wouldn't even respond to critics.
[01:56:14.380 --> 01:56:15.380]  Yeah, I don't.
[01:56:15.380 --> 01:56:16.380]  I always do.
[01:56:16.380 --> 01:56:17.380]  It's just meant to change the subject.
[01:56:17.380 --> 01:56:22.420]  Yeah, but all this information is to help those people who are on the edge to say, hey,
[01:56:22.420 --> 01:56:23.420]  this is really happening.
[01:56:23.420 --> 01:56:24.420]  Look at your areas.
[01:56:24.420 --> 01:56:27.900]  So I hope to have that finished by the end of July because it's very technical, and I'm
[01:56:27.900 --> 01:56:32.300]  trying to get it to a non-technical level so everyone can understand what I found and
[01:56:32.300 --> 01:56:35.300]  the trends across this country, and it's not even across the country.
[01:56:35.300 --> 01:56:39.220]  I haven't been able to get records in other countries, but I have kind of liaisons in
[01:56:39.220 --> 01:56:44.700]  other countries, other biologists and chemists, actually, who are fully awake to this.
[01:56:44.700 --> 01:56:49.660]  And one thing I wanted to bring up for what we discussed earlier of how big this program
[01:56:49.660 --> 01:56:54.140]  is, I don't know if you've heard of this new TV series on the Weather Channel called Hacking
[01:56:54.140 --> 01:56:59.060]  the Planet, but it's a new show just aired a couple months ago.
[01:56:59.060 --> 01:57:03.980]  They had an episode about weather modification, and in the show they talked about how they
[01:57:03.980 --> 01:57:06.180]  did weather weaponry for Vietnam.
[01:57:06.180 --> 01:57:11.360]  They openly admitted that there are contractors that are doing, quote, cloud seeding.
[01:57:11.360 --> 01:57:15.320]  Bill Gates runs a giant company, quote, that can control hurricanes.
[01:57:15.320 --> 01:57:20.220]  I had been Livingston, the father of weather weapons, on, he's like 90 something now.
[01:57:20.220 --> 01:57:22.700]  He broke it with me because it had just been declassified.
[01:57:22.700 --> 01:57:27.300]  He was the father of weather weapons, first kind of fly into typhoons and hurricanes back
[01:57:27.300 --> 01:57:28.700]  in the 40s.
[01:57:28.700 --> 01:57:33.540]  And he was the guy that led squadrons in Vietnam, and he admitted all this.
[01:57:33.540 --> 01:57:40.100]  And they could control hurricanes in the 60s, Stanford Research Institute certified.
[01:57:40.100 --> 01:57:44.540]  And what do you think they're doing here, cuz they're not just doing weather modification.
[01:57:44.540 --> 01:57:48.620]  What do you think this larger program is, and what did your findings, I mean, obviously
[01:57:48.620 --> 01:57:50.340]  from what I've seen, it's going up.
[01:57:50.340 --> 01:57:52.380]  Is that what you're finding, show this stuff's going up?
[01:57:52.380 --> 01:57:56.820]  It is definitely going up, and like you said, I'm very familiar with the work.
[01:57:56.820 --> 01:57:59.460]  I think it all started out as weather weaponry.
[01:57:59.460 --> 01:58:03.480]  And I think over time, different corporations and government entities realized how they
[01:58:03.480 --> 01:58:04.480]  can all profit.
[01:58:04.480 --> 01:58:07.180]  We're all familiar with UN Agenda 21.
[01:58:07.180 --> 01:58:11.660]  And one thing that all these people that work in the health profession and OSHA will never
[01:58:11.660 --> 01:58:16.780]  talk about the number one hazard that is hidden, and that's called autotoxicity.
[01:58:16.780 --> 01:58:21.540]  And it's certain constituents in pharmaceuticals and in these materials used in geoengineering
[01:58:21.540 --> 01:58:26.340]  to where when you are inhaling or ingesting certain constituents, it actually poisons
[01:58:26.340 --> 01:58:27.340]  the inner ear.
[01:58:27.340 --> 01:58:30.460]  So you're hearing these crazy stories of children.
[01:58:30.460 --> 01:58:31.740]  When I was in school, I didn't have-
[01:58:31.740 --> 01:58:37.300]  No, no, no, stay there, you're on to it, it's also a binary weapon system, absolutely.
[01:58:37.300 --> 01:58:39.180]  And then they're doing it mainly to America.
[01:58:39.180 --> 01:58:52.300]  You are listening to GCN, visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:52.300 --> 01:58:56.520]  There's been a disaster and most of you don't even realize the terrible danger we're in.
[01:58:56.520 --> 01:59:00.180]  Alex Jones has warned you for years to get a good food storage.
[01:59:00.180 --> 01:59:05.180]  We thought the danger was drought, or food delivered to our gas tanks, or our food sold
[01:59:05.180 --> 01:59:10.200]  to other countries, or food so expensive that only those on food stamps and welfare could
[01:59:10.200 --> 01:59:11.200]  afford it.
[01:59:11.200 --> 01:59:16.080]  But we have just experienced the most effective way to lose your freedom, liberty, and security
[01:59:16.080 --> 01:59:19.380]  without even a fight, government regulation.
[01:59:19.380 --> 01:59:25.180]  After a 160 year tradition of self-reliance, the do-it-yourself and charitable Mormon food
[01:59:25.180 --> 01:59:30.500]  storage canneries in half the country are forced to shut down due to excessive government
[01:59:30.500 --> 01:59:31.780]  regulations.
[01:59:31.780 --> 01:59:34.260]  Grow your own food, more regulations.
[01:59:34.260 --> 01:59:37.860]  If you've ever been warned to get food while you can, this is it.
[01:59:37.860 --> 01:59:43.820]  Call 800-409-5633 or on the web, efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[01:59:43.820 --> 01:59:53.880]  That's 800-409-5633 or on the web, efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[01:59:53.880 --> 02:00:05.660]  Raging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.660 --> 02:00:10.460]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.460 --> 02:00:11.460]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.460 --> 02:00:13.580]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.580 --> 02:00:17.780]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.780 --> 02:00:30.420]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:30.420 --> 02:00:33.860]  Joel Scowel's been getting into all the big controversy, he's the one he thinks is behind
[02:00:33.860 --> 02:00:36.940]  it and where this country is, he's going to be in studio with us.
[02:00:36.940 --> 02:00:39.020]  He's also on the Nightly News for another big subject.
[02:00:39.020 --> 02:00:42.900]  Tonight, I'll get his view on geoengineering as well, I don't think I've ever asked him
[02:00:42.900 --> 02:00:43.900]  that.
[02:00:43.900 --> 02:00:47.220]  Finishing up here, we're going to be on for a full hour when a report comes out in July,
[02:00:47.220 --> 02:00:52.580]  Justin Meghan, Air Force whistleblower who was there, watching them shipping in tons
[02:00:52.580 --> 02:00:58.900]  of barium salts, aluminum oxide in the aerosolized form, which is what they're using for weather
[02:00:58.900 --> 02:00:59.900]  mod.
[02:00:59.900 --> 02:01:03.540]  And then the White House Science Czar admits they're doing it, but it's classified.
[02:01:03.540 --> 02:01:07.660]  And Bill Gates brags, and they have conferences where they admit it, and then they have newscasts
[02:01:07.660 --> 02:01:08.660]  going crazy.
[02:01:08.660 --> 02:01:11.300]  People say the planes are spraying something.
[02:01:11.300 --> 02:01:12.300]  Those are ice crystals.
[02:01:12.300 --> 02:01:16.580]  Yes, I remember when a kid watching the ice crystals disappear, on a really cold day they
[02:01:16.580 --> 02:01:17.580]  might stay there five minutes.
[02:01:17.580 --> 02:01:21.820]  We're talking about hours and creating whole plaques.
[02:01:21.820 --> 02:01:25.860]  So other in the five minutes we've got left here, three, four minutes, Meghan, Kristen,
[02:01:25.860 --> 02:01:29.220]  Meghan, what other tidbits do you want to impart to people about what's really going
[02:01:29.220 --> 02:01:32.220]  on here and the whole health effects of this?
[02:01:32.220 --> 02:01:37.460]  Well, the biggest issue again, what I discussed before the break was the auto toxicity and
[02:01:37.460 --> 02:01:43.500]  all of the health hazards that are associated with these constituents through it's inhalation
[02:01:43.500 --> 02:01:46.420]  hazard, it's an adjustment within our food and water.
[02:01:46.420 --> 02:01:50.740]  I'm sure people are familiar with how Monsanto is resistant to a lot of constituents to use
[02:01:50.740 --> 02:01:52.700]  in geoengineering.
[02:01:52.700 --> 02:01:55.900]  It's about believing, and this is my biggest thing.
[02:01:55.900 --> 02:01:57.760]  You always say go out and research it yourself.
[02:01:57.760 --> 02:02:03.540]  You can air sample, soil sample for all of these constituents, all the panel for under
[02:02:03.540 --> 02:02:04.540]  $50.
[02:02:04.540 --> 02:02:08.380]  You can look up the lab in your area, do it for yourself.
[02:02:08.380 --> 02:02:10.980]  Find out what the background is in your area and you can see-
[02:02:10.980 --> 02:02:17.020]  Highly poisonous levels of this are everywhere and everybody in the EPA and state levels
[02:02:17.020 --> 02:02:20.020]  are told shut up.
[02:02:20.020 --> 02:02:21.020]  You're exactly right.
[02:02:21.020 --> 02:02:24.100]  And as a federal employee, I was told to shut up.
[02:02:24.100 --> 02:02:29.740]  I didn't get responses from the EPA in my region and I was a GS-12 working for the VA
[02:02:29.740 --> 02:02:34.020]  and I had the credentials for them to realize I wasn't some crazy conspiracy theorist.
[02:02:34.020 --> 02:02:40.460]  I have the credentials and the interactions and the networking to say this isn't right.
[02:02:40.460 --> 02:02:45.060]  And what's happening is because we're exposing them, they're now trying to segue with shows
[02:02:45.060 --> 02:02:51.100]  and movies and Time Magazine for Kids last year said, look, it's sunscreen for the planet
[02:02:51.100 --> 02:02:53.420]  and said, we're spraying this.
[02:02:53.420 --> 02:02:55.500]  It's added to the fuel.
[02:02:55.500 --> 02:02:57.820]  They're admitting it to kids.
[02:02:57.820 --> 02:03:03.300]  And then here's Bill Gates, Bill Gates' climate scientist lobbying for large scale geoengineering.
[02:03:03.300 --> 02:03:08.600]  Other wealthy individuals have also funded a series of reports and tests for us.
[02:03:08.600 --> 02:03:11.420]  Isn't that sweet, to save the climate.
[02:03:11.420 --> 02:03:17.340]  Oh, so see now because we're exposing it, they're now trying to segue, super creepy.
[02:03:17.340 --> 02:03:21.620]  Bill Gates who says there's too many of us are, I'm spraying aluminum on you that sterilizes
[02:03:21.620 --> 02:03:27.220]  you and causes neurological disorders cuz I love you children.
[02:03:27.220 --> 02:03:28.220]  You're exactly right.
[02:03:28.220 --> 02:03:32.640]  And the rise in the neurological and respiratory illness are documented, especially if you
[02:03:32.640 --> 02:03:36.380]  follow a lot of the OSHA reports related to those in industry.
[02:03:36.380 --> 02:03:40.860]  I mean, I know personal medical for the general public you can't find, but in the workforce
[02:03:40.860 --> 02:03:41.960]  you can.
[02:03:41.960 --> 02:03:45.700]  And that's why a lot of people in general industry and construction are saying, okay,
[02:03:45.700 --> 02:03:49.300]  people are claiming these injury and illnesses not related to our hazard.
[02:03:49.300 --> 02:03:53.180]  These are people that work around soil remediation, construction workers.
[02:03:53.180 --> 02:03:54.980]  I mean, this stuff is all documented.
[02:03:54.980 --> 02:03:56.540]  You just have to connect the-
[02:03:56.540 --> 02:04:00.340]  Well, if Hitler would have taken groups he wanted to kill, if he would have taken over
[02:04:00.340 --> 02:04:05.800]  Russia to some area of Siberia, put them there and then flew over and sprayed them at this,
[02:04:05.800 --> 02:04:07.140]  they would have never even known.
[02:04:07.140 --> 02:04:10.820]  I mean, again, it's a soft kill weapon.
[02:04:10.820 --> 02:04:11.820]  You're exactly right.
[02:04:11.820 --> 02:04:15.220]  And one thing here, I live in the west suburbs of Chicago, we just had a notice from the
[02:04:15.220 --> 02:04:20.980]  police department letting us know that they were spraying BTK to kill gypsy moss and that
[02:04:20.980 --> 02:04:27.540]  there's nothing wrong with BTK, which the biology of BTK if inhaled has potential effects
[02:04:27.540 --> 02:04:32.220]  as the same protein buildup as anthrax, but you're gonna say it's safe.
[02:04:32.220 --> 02:04:36.780]  So they'll alert us about spraying a contaminant on us, a biological contaminant slash weapon.
[02:04:36.780 --> 02:04:38.300]  Well, that's just to get you used to it.
[02:04:38.300 --> 02:04:42.140]  Yeah, they killed people in the New York subway in 68, the tells remain classified.
[02:04:42.140 --> 02:04:45.220]  But I mean, shooting black men up with syphilis, that's loving.
[02:04:45.220 --> 02:04:46.220]  Don't be an extremist.
[02:04:46.220 --> 02:04:50.340]  Folks, drink your fluoride, take your shots, enjoy the increased cancer rates.
[02:04:50.340 --> 02:04:52.660]  The government loves you, okay?
[02:04:52.660 --> 02:04:54.620]  Kristen Meghan, we'll talk to you again soon.
[02:04:54.620 --> 02:05:00.900]  We salute your courage, God bless you.

[02:06:18.140 --> 02:06:23.620]  be several hundred times more effective than colloidal or ionic silver and is powerful
[02:06:23.620 --> 02:06:27.020]  enough to help protect you and your family.

[02:06:31.500 --> 02:06:33.900]  use inside the body as well as out.
[02:06:33.900 --> 02:06:38.340]  The Science Digest Journal says silver is our mightiest germ fighter.
[02:06:38.340 --> 02:06:43.740]  It is virtually non-toxic and is emerging as a wonder of modern medicine.
[02:06:43.740 --> 02:06:48.220]  Supernatural Silver is the number one choice of thousands for improved health and immune
[02:06:48.220 --> 02:06:49.220]  system support.

[02:07:00.780 --> 02:07:05.860]  A little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why, even if I had a pretty
[02:07:05.860 --> 02:07:08.220]  good sized meal, that I was still starving.
[02:07:08.220 --> 02:07:13.200]  My research led me to a well known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on
[02:07:13.200 --> 02:07:18.380]  here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost
[02:07:18.380 --> 02:07:24.060]  all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves,
[02:07:24.060 --> 02:07:25.860]  fight off cancer and be healthy.
[02:07:25.860 --> 02:07:32.180]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Younggevity.
[02:07:32.180 --> 02:07:36.740]  The Younggevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need and once you've
[02:07:36.740 --> 02:07:40.140]  got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[02:07:40.140 --> 02:07:46.580]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[02:07:46.580 --> 02:07:48.820]  Check it out for yourself, it's incredible.

[02:08:04.180 --> 02:08:15.500]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:15.500 --> 02:08:28.700]  We're now into hour number three, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:08:28.700 --> 02:08:32.420]  It is the 20th day of May 2013.
[02:08:32.420 --> 02:08:36.580]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we're gonna have Joel Skalzen who's in studio with us
[02:08:36.580 --> 02:08:41.220]  on for I think about an hour special interview tonight, we'll see how long it goes, on strategic
[02:08:41.220 --> 02:08:42.540]  relocation.
[02:08:42.540 --> 02:08:45.460]  What does that really mean?
[02:08:45.460 --> 02:08:50.900]  Government strategically locates, corporations strategically locate, I noticed in his book,
[02:08:50.900 --> 02:08:54.900]  it's the best research I've seen out there in the film we produced, strategic relocation
[02:08:54.900 --> 02:09:00.460]  that where he's saying live is where the globalists are moving in many cases, but he picks areas
[02:09:00.460 --> 02:09:03.980]  alternate to that but still close by.
[02:09:03.980 --> 02:09:08.900]  And where I live, which I separately did my own research and later found he'd also recommended,
[02:09:08.900 --> 02:09:14.620]  the hill country of Austin is one of the few safer areas in a whole constellation of problems.
[02:09:14.620 --> 02:09:18.540]  And that's basic mammals try to pick a place that they think is safe.
[02:09:18.540 --> 02:09:22.740]  They act like being prepared and being ready is kooky or weird.
[02:09:22.740 --> 02:09:27.640]  That is a instinct of moronic-ness or kind of an anti-instinct to try to drum into you,
[02:09:27.640 --> 02:09:31.900]  but that's tonight, Nightly News, 7 o'clock this evening.
[02:09:31.900 --> 02:09:36.620]  And we're gonna interview him today for Obama Deception 2, so he's got a grueling work schedule.
[02:09:36.620 --> 02:09:38.020]  No, I know he'll love it.
[02:09:38.020 --> 02:09:42.140]  He also just survived, we'll talk about that at the end of the hour, a harrowing plane
[02:09:42.140 --> 02:09:47.140]  crash they said was one in a million to survive, much less be unscathed, talk about guardian
[02:09:47.140 --> 02:09:48.140]  angels.
[02:09:48.140 --> 02:09:52.900]  So we're glad to have you here, Joel, in person and he flew on a commercial aircraft to get
[02:09:52.900 --> 02:09:53.900]  here.
[02:09:53.900 --> 02:10:00.140]  He was a former Marine Corps, was a captain or more in the Marines, carrier pilot, naval
[02:10:00.140 --> 02:10:02.700]  pilot, so interesting individual.
[02:10:02.700 --> 02:10:08.720]  We're gonna have Joel Skousen with us in this hour, though, to cover the latest developments
[02:10:08.720 --> 02:10:15.740]  on the IRS, the spying on the reporters, and where he thinks that's going politically.
[02:10:15.740 --> 02:10:19.140]  And is this a chilling effect or are they trying to divert off of Benghazi?
[02:10:19.140 --> 02:10:24.340]  I think they hope that at first, but this is actually capturing people's imagination.
[02:10:24.340 --> 02:10:25.340]  How do you pray?
[02:10:25.340 --> 02:10:26.340]  What is your pro-life?
[02:10:26.340 --> 02:10:30.940]  They told pro-life groups, you've gotta go out and 50% of the time be pro-abortion.
[02:10:30.940 --> 02:10:31.940]  Government can't do that.
[02:10:31.940 --> 02:10:33.900]  They can't tell you what your First Amendment is.
[02:10:33.900 --> 02:10:38.020]  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise
[02:10:38.020 --> 02:10:39.020]  thereof.
[02:10:39.020 --> 02:10:40.020]  That's how the First Amendment begins.
[02:10:40.020 --> 02:10:42.340]  Then it's the freedom of the press, freedom to assemble.
[02:10:42.340 --> 02:10:47.060]  So that's all the info we're gonna be going over on that front, and then how that ties
[02:10:47.060 --> 02:10:48.060]  into Benghazi.
[02:10:48.060 --> 02:10:54.060]  And of course, Joel Skousen is also the editor-in-chief over at worldaffairsbrief.com, and I think
[02:10:54.060 --> 02:10:58.500]  has some of the most, from my research, and I'm obsessed with this stuff, folks.
[02:10:58.500 --> 02:11:01.520]  So I tend to know what I'm talking about a little bit, says some of the best piercing
[02:11:01.520 --> 02:11:04.400]  analysis out there.
[02:11:04.400 --> 02:11:07.700]  And so he joins us to break all this down.
[02:11:07.700 --> 02:11:09.020]  Joel Skousen, good to have you here with us.
[02:11:09.020 --> 02:11:10.700]  It's good to be with you, Alex.
[02:11:10.700 --> 02:11:16.820]  I really, when we talk about news, we've got a lot of facts out there, but it is the analysis
[02:11:16.820 --> 02:11:21.060]  that makes your stuff valuable, that makes my stuff valuable, because we never get all
[02:11:21.060 --> 02:11:22.060]  the news.
[02:11:22.060 --> 02:11:25.420]  This is a conspiracy of omission of what's true and what's false.
[02:11:25.420 --> 02:11:30.780]  You just have a lot of stuff missing, and we have to piece the puzzle back together.
[02:11:30.780 --> 02:11:35.060]  You've had a couple of weeks now to ruminate, got a new report out at worldaffairsbrief.com
[02:11:35.060 --> 02:11:36.100]  right now.
[02:11:36.100 --> 02:11:39.740]  You've had some time to sit back and look at Benghazi.
[02:11:39.740 --> 02:11:43.100]  You were on right after it happened, your analysis has turned out to be dead on.
[02:11:43.100 --> 02:11:47.540]  Same analysis, basically, of Colonel Shaffer, same analysis of some of our other guests.
[02:11:47.540 --> 02:11:53.060]  I wanna recap that coming up, but looking at IRS gate, looking at Spygate, looking at
[02:11:53.060 --> 02:11:58.060]  intimidation gate, what's really going on here?
[02:11:58.060 --> 02:12:02.940]  First of all, it's important to remember, I was reviewing just this morning the church
[02:12:02.940 --> 02:12:08.620]  committee hearings about the CIA, where a lot was revealed about the CIA.
[02:12:08.620 --> 02:12:12.620]  And in that, Walter Mondale came out and said directly.
[02:12:12.620 --> 02:12:18.700]  Now we've got evidence here that the IRS has been targeting individuals that the government
[02:12:18.700 --> 02:12:23.020]  views as hostile to their point of view, and that they're subjecting them to yearly audits
[02:12:23.020 --> 02:12:24.240]  one after another.
[02:12:24.240 --> 02:12:27.480]  Now he didn't specify who they are, but I happen to know.
[02:12:27.480 --> 02:12:30.940]  When I was chairman of the Conservative National Committee, I talked to Bunker Hunt and I talked
[02:12:30.940 --> 02:12:35.700]  to a lot of the other funders of various conservative and Christian points, and they were all being
[02:12:35.700 --> 02:12:37.780]  audited every year.
[02:12:37.780 --> 02:12:39.500]  We now know that that was targeted.
[02:12:39.500 --> 02:12:42.300]  That was clear back in the 80s when that was going on.
[02:12:42.300 --> 02:12:44.220]  It's still going on.
[02:12:44.220 --> 02:12:48.820]  So now we have a cover up about the fact that this has been going on.
[02:12:48.820 --> 02:12:50.420]  The press isn't focusing on that.
[02:12:50.420 --> 02:12:54.740]  What they're focusing on is the fact that the president fired somebody who was in fact
[02:12:54.740 --> 02:12:57.820]  gonna resign and was going to in fact be leaving.
[02:12:57.820 --> 02:13:01.500]  Steve Miller, the acting IRS chief, had nothing to do with this.
[02:13:01.500 --> 02:13:03.060]  So a total cynical fraud.
[02:13:03.060 --> 02:13:05.420]  A total cynical fraud, but it's even worse.
[02:13:05.420 --> 02:13:13.220]  We have Joseph Grant, who was just put in the place of Susan Ingram, who was in fact
[02:13:13.220 --> 02:13:18.020]  in charge of this division over tax exempt groups.
[02:13:18.020 --> 02:13:24.080]  He was just put in to replace her, graduate stepped up, and he had to step down as a second
[02:13:24.080 --> 02:13:28.300]  one because it wasn't enough to fire Steve Hall.
[02:13:28.300 --> 02:13:34.660]  And Susan Hall Ingram now is in charge of the IRS tax policy for Obamacare, of sticking
[02:13:34.660 --> 02:13:39.660]  it to those of us who don't have insurance by choice because we don't like the medical
[02:13:39.660 --> 02:13:40.780]  establishment system.
[02:13:40.780 --> 02:13:45.760]  And now the woman that ordered all this illegal spying and harassment, she's the head of the
[02:13:45.760 --> 02:13:48.180]  Obamacare division with our records.
[02:13:48.180 --> 02:13:52.120]  I mean, it's clear they plan to use the IRS as their Gestapo.
[02:13:52.120 --> 02:13:53.120]  That's right.
[02:13:53.120 --> 02:13:58.940]  And Lois Lerner, who's the actual on-hands in daily charge of the division, was not fired.
[02:13:58.940 --> 02:14:00.980]  And she certainly has to know about this.
[02:14:00.980 --> 02:14:02.840]  But it goes beyond, as I say, the Obamacare.
[02:14:02.840 --> 02:14:08.660]  So that brings up the case, it goes beyond the IRS currently, it goes beyond the Obama
[02:14:08.660 --> 02:14:12.580]  administration that was going on during the Bush administration, the Clinton administration,
[02:14:12.580 --> 02:14:13.580]  and clear back on.
[02:14:13.580 --> 02:14:16.020]  Even during the Reagan administration, the IRS was targeting people.
[02:14:16.020 --> 02:14:18.860]  We have a runaway dark side of government.
[02:14:18.860 --> 02:14:24.100]  We have legitimate CIA and dark side CIA, we have legitimate FBI and dark side CIA.
[02:14:24.100 --> 02:14:28.580]  And in the IRS, we have legitimate honest people doing IRS work and we have dark side
[02:14:28.580 --> 02:14:32.300]  IRS, and they aren't allowed to know what the other is doing.
[02:14:32.300 --> 02:14:34.300]  They're compartmentalization.
[02:14:34.300 --> 02:14:35.460]  Exactly.
[02:14:35.460 --> 02:14:37.460]  And so I don't expect to see any change.
[02:14:37.460 --> 02:14:42.540]  There's going to be some congressional investigations, as in Benghazi, they're not gonna go after
[02:14:42.540 --> 02:14:48.220]  the real problem, which is who gave, I mean, look at the Treasury Inspector General.
[02:14:48.220 --> 02:14:54.460]  Comes out with a report that this was a managerial problem, that somehow these magically appear,
[02:14:54.460 --> 02:14:58.780]  these criteria which were incorrect and they ended up targeting magically, without any
[02:14:58.780 --> 02:15:02.420]  human intervention, some 500 conservative groups.
[02:15:02.420 --> 02:15:07.020]  Well, I've even seen Rachel Maddow and people say, we need to go after these groups, look
[02:15:07.020 --> 02:15:08.980]  at their tax exemption.
[02:15:08.980 --> 02:15:13.220]  Media Matters put a memo out three years ago saying, we're gonna infiltrate media groups
[02:15:13.220 --> 02:15:14.220]  and destroy them.
[02:15:14.220 --> 02:15:18.820]  That's why it's encouraging the head of the RNC said, Obama is running a guerrilla war.
[02:15:18.820 --> 02:15:22.260]  He said this over the weekend on Fox, against conservatives.
[02:15:22.260 --> 02:15:23.260]  That's absolutely true.
[02:15:23.260 --> 02:15:24.480]  It is a guerrilla war.
[02:15:24.480 --> 02:15:27.540]  They deny what they're doing while they do it.
[02:15:27.540 --> 02:15:30.660]  Of course they ordered it, from Fast and Furious to this.
[02:15:30.660 --> 02:15:36.300]  Well, in the Cincinnati, our IRS person said anonymously without giving his name that everything
[02:15:36.300 --> 02:15:39.300]  that we do at the IRS comes down from the- Well, of course it does.
[02:15:39.300 --> 02:15:44.860]  Yes, it's just like the DEA when they cover up for drugs that are imported from Mexico
[02:15:44.860 --> 02:15:49.580]  and they refuse to let the snooping dogs go in after trucks that are sealed in Mexico,
[02:15:49.580 --> 02:15:51.660]  they say orders come from Washington.
[02:15:51.660 --> 02:15:52.660]  So that's what happens.
[02:15:52.660 --> 02:15:56.080]  But the Treasury was covering up for this today on their IRS investigation.
[02:15:56.080 --> 02:15:59.460]  They said, we interviewed every official we could talk to.
[02:15:59.460 --> 02:16:04.780]  And they assured us that no one outside of the IRS had any influence on this tax policy.
[02:16:04.780 --> 02:16:09.760]  But that's not the issue, Alex, about who outside the IRS, they're assuming that if
[02:16:09.760 --> 02:16:13.740]  it's political interference with the IRS, it has to be from some politician outside
[02:16:13.740 --> 02:16:14.980]  the agency.
[02:16:14.980 --> 02:16:17.900]  This has been going on from within the agency for decades.
[02:16:17.900 --> 02:16:24.220]  Well, I know for a fact that they use food trucks with packaged food out of Mexico with
[02:16:24.220 --> 02:16:26.180]  the cocaine hidden in it.
[02:16:26.180 --> 02:16:30.860]  And one time the state police stopped a truck, found three tons of cocaine, were ordered
[02:16:30.860 --> 02:16:32.260]  to turn it over.
[02:16:32.260 --> 02:16:36.660]  And then they deliver it and then it's brought into a major grocery store chain and distributed
[02:16:36.660 --> 02:16:37.660]  out.
[02:16:37.660 --> 02:16:38.760]  And it's just well known.
[02:16:38.760 --> 02:16:41.620]  And then the cops wanna pull me over and ask if I have drugs in my car.
[02:16:41.620 --> 02:16:44.420]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[02:16:44.420 --> 02:16:49.200]  So there is a dark side of every portion of government in terms of enforcement and it's
[02:16:49.200 --> 02:16:51.480]  starting to get out more and more.
[02:16:51.480 --> 02:16:54.340]  But when it gets out, and this is what we're seeing, it's gonna be the big thing we're
[02:16:54.340 --> 02:16:59.620]  gonna have to discuss is whether or not they're gonna take down Obama over these things.
[02:16:59.620 --> 02:17:02.100]  Because there's four major scandals now that have piled up.
[02:17:02.100 --> 02:17:07.060]  That's why I wanna ask you, why did the scandals come out now from your intel and your analysis?
[02:17:07.060 --> 02:17:10.620]  What does this signify and where is it going?
[02:17:10.620 --> 02:17:12.020]  It is hard to tell.
[02:17:12.020 --> 02:17:16.220]  In the AP scandal, for example, of the news, I know how this happened.
[02:17:16.220 --> 02:17:21.320]  Now, I wanna be very, very clear with your listeners that the government surveils every
[02:17:21.320 --> 02:17:23.260]  form of communication.
[02:17:23.260 --> 02:17:24.540]  They don't listen to it all.
[02:17:24.540 --> 02:17:25.540]  They record it all.
[02:17:25.540 --> 02:17:26.540]  They record it all.
[02:17:26.540 --> 02:17:27.540]  It's all digitally recorded.
[02:17:27.540 --> 02:17:29.060]  Then they go back when they want to.
[02:17:29.060 --> 02:17:30.060]  That's right.
[02:17:30.060 --> 02:17:31.060]  They go back.
[02:17:31.060 --> 02:17:32.060]  Actually, they're sifting.
[02:17:32.060 --> 02:17:35.580]  They have computers going through and sifting and picking out keywords and compartmentalizing.
[02:17:35.580 --> 02:17:37.420]  They have basic compartments for criminals.
[02:17:37.420 --> 02:17:39.140]  They have basic compartments for enemies.
[02:17:39.140 --> 02:17:40.660]  They have compartments for allies.
[02:17:40.660 --> 02:17:41.660]  They spy on Israel.
[02:17:41.660 --> 02:17:42.660]  They spy on France.
[02:17:42.660 --> 02:17:43.660]  They spy on Britain.
[02:17:43.660 --> 02:17:45.800]  They don't like to say that, but they do that.
[02:17:45.800 --> 02:17:48.960]  And those allies, to a certain extent, spy on us as well.
[02:17:48.960 --> 02:17:50.580]  But they also have compartments for dissidents.
[02:17:50.580 --> 02:17:52.660]  And those are divided into right and left.
[02:17:52.660 --> 02:17:57.540]  By far, the largest compartment are people like you and I and followers who believe in
[02:17:57.540 --> 02:17:58.540]  the Constitution.
[02:17:58.540 --> 02:18:00.340]  Those are considered future domestic enemies.
[02:18:00.340 --> 02:18:05.940]  And they've now bled over and admitted their total obsession is on us because we know who
[02:18:05.940 --> 02:18:07.000]  they are.
[02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:08.000]  We know the ballgame.
[02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.120]  It's not Al-Qaeda, it's us.
[02:18:10.120 --> 02:18:15.020]  And to a certain extent, there are those on the left who are legitimate liberals, meaning
[02:18:15.020 --> 02:18:18.900]  they are concerned about civil liberties.
[02:18:18.900 --> 02:18:21.460]  They do have a leftist bent, which we don't agree with.
[02:18:21.460 --> 02:18:25.980]  But they are also the enemies, because in many regards, those leftist liberals, like
[02:18:25.980 --> 02:18:29.740]  Glenn Greenwald of The Guardian, does a yeoman's work-
[02:18:29.740 --> 02:18:32.120]  Now he's right here coming out against the DOJ.
[02:18:32.120 --> 02:18:33.120]  That's exactly right.
[02:18:33.120 --> 02:18:34.120]  He's attacking those things.
[02:18:34.120 --> 02:18:36.320]  So they want to discredit those people eventually.
[02:18:36.320 --> 02:18:37.660]  So they're keeping track of all those.
[02:18:37.660 --> 02:18:42.500]  But what happened in the AP case, as well as the recent today, it broke about the Fox
[02:18:42.500 --> 02:18:50.340]  News, Mr. Rosen that was surveilled, is that in order to go through and do a detailed search
[02:18:50.340 --> 02:18:54.860]  and get all the listening done, they do a special search that goes through DOJ that
[02:18:54.860 --> 02:18:59.260]  tasked the CIA and the NSA to pull up everything they've got on this particular person.
[02:18:59.260 --> 02:19:01.460]  In this case, it was a very broad search.
[02:19:01.460 --> 02:19:07.780]  Well, somebody down the line leaked this to the AP, recognized this is an illegal call
[02:19:07.780 --> 02:19:08.780]  for a search.
[02:19:08.780 --> 02:19:13.420]  They're doing a subpoena, the DOJ has specific procedures that they've got to follow through,
[02:19:13.420 --> 02:19:18.060]  including alerting the news organization, AP, that we're going to do an investigation
[02:19:18.060 --> 02:19:22.400]  and we're going to subpoena records and give them a chance to appear in court and say show
[02:19:22.400 --> 02:19:25.340]  cause about whether or not you really have the power.
[02:19:25.340 --> 02:19:26.340]  They didn't do that.
[02:19:26.340 --> 02:19:28.500]  And again, the truth is they're already grabbing everything.
[02:19:28.500 --> 02:19:31.700]  It's just when they want to now use it in court, they go get the subpoenas and everything.
[02:19:31.700 --> 02:19:32.700]  That's right.
[02:19:32.700 --> 02:19:35.640]  Now what happens here, and this is what we've got to determine, is whether or not those
[02:19:35.640 --> 02:19:42.220]  leaks were purposeful or whether or not they were actually a whistleblower within the DOJ.
[02:19:42.220 --> 02:19:46.100]  It looks to me like it's a whistleblower because this is going to hurt them, but maybe they're
[02:19:46.100 --> 02:19:48.120]  going to double back and use it as a chilling effect.
[02:19:48.120 --> 02:19:49.120]  Stay there.
[02:19:49.120 --> 02:19:53.000]  We're going to be right back with Joel Skousen, editor in chief of worldaffairsbrief.com.
[02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.540]  And again, I'm Alex Jones of infowars.com.
[02:19:55.540 --> 02:19:59.660]  This country is on the knife's edge of falling into pure evil.
[02:19:59.660 --> 02:20:00.660]  Stay with us.
[02:20:00.660 --> 02:20:04.560]  If you're going to have a bunker, why not have an ultimate bunker?

[02:20:30.260 --> 02:20:32.420]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:20:32.420 --> 02:20:36.140]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold
[02:20:36.140 --> 02:20:37.140]  IRAs?
[02:20:37.140 --> 02:20:41.060]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value
[02:20:41.060 --> 02:20:42.740]  of gold for your retirement.
[02:20:42.740 --> 02:20:46.180]  Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:20:46.180 --> 02:20:51.060]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:51.060 --> 02:20:56.660]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns, call 800-686-2237.

[02:21:39.260 --> 02:21:44.100]  natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the

[02:22:34.300 --> 02:22:38.860]  If Obama has his way, all guns will be either banned, restricted, or confiscated, possibly
[02:22:38.860 --> 02:22:40.500]  by executive order.
[02:22:40.500 --> 02:22:42.940]  The best way to keep your guns is to hide them.
[02:22:42.940 --> 02:22:45.540]  What Obama can't find, Obama can't take away.

[02:23:05.020 --> 02:23:07.860]  coffee grounds, pizza crusts, and more into the Bokashi.
[02:23:07.860 --> 02:23:11.440]  If you love to garden and compost but don't like the hassle of turning a compost bin or
[02:23:11.440 --> 02:23:16.340]  the smell, then check out the EM Bokashi Food Waste Recycling System from Terreganics.
[02:23:16.340 --> 02:23:20.340]  Finally a way to recycle all your food and plant waste safely and effectively and stop
[02:23:20.340 --> 02:23:21.700]  using fertilizers.
[02:23:21.700 --> 02:23:24.140]  The EM Bokashi Food Waste Recycling System.
[02:23:24.140 --> 02:23:28.460]  Rather than decomposition, the Bokashi system uses fermentation to break down waste so it
[02:23:28.460 --> 02:23:32.940]  takes less time to create nutrient-dense humus for crops or gardens with no turning and no
[02:23:32.940 --> 02:23:34.280]  obnoxious odors.

[02:23:57.420 --> 02:23:58.420]  Life's getting better.
[02:23:58.420 --> 02:23:59.420]  Federal agents!
[02:23:59.420 --> 02:24:00.420]  We are armed!
[02:24:00.420 --> 02:24:10.500]  By the way, this is breaking news at infoawards.com.
[02:24:10.500 --> 02:24:14.580]  Adam Kokesh should be charged with assaulting a federal officer so they come up while he's
[02:24:14.580 --> 02:24:19.140]  giving a speech, grab him, he puts his hands up, slam him to the ground, and then charge
[02:24:19.140 --> 02:24:20.140]  him.
[02:24:20.140 --> 02:24:23.340]  Carved before the horse, why were they arresting him to begin with and then how did he assault
[02:24:23.340 --> 02:24:24.340]  him, which he clearly didn't?
[02:24:24.340 --> 02:24:28.020]  They're going to have trouble making that case with the video and everything else.
[02:24:28.020 --> 02:24:31.180]  Absolutely, let's punch up his mic there.
[02:24:31.180 --> 02:24:32.180]  Joel, go ahead.
[02:24:32.180 --> 02:24:36.280]  Yeah, the thing that I observed, and he did it correctly, he wasn't smoking marijuana.
[02:24:36.280 --> 02:24:40.380]  If they were going to arrest anyone, they had to arrest the ones that were violating
[02:24:40.380 --> 02:24:42.220]  the law of the park and arrest them.
[02:24:42.220 --> 02:24:43.820]  He was merely the spokesman.
[02:24:43.820 --> 02:24:47.540]  They were clearly going after him and took him down.
[02:24:47.540 --> 02:24:48.540]  They've got video.
[02:24:48.540 --> 02:24:52.060]  I don't think they're going to be able to make this stick if they allow in court, and
[02:24:52.060 --> 02:24:55.420]  that's the big question, whether or not they'll allow any of that evidence to come in from
[02:24:55.420 --> 02:24:59.120]  the private hands.
[02:24:59.120 --> 02:25:06.460]  I'm not in favor of irritating the government on illegal acts, and you have to be very careful
[02:25:06.460 --> 02:25:08.380]  when you do to appear very, very innocent.
[02:25:08.380 --> 02:25:14.700]  You don't go around calling the police criminals, even if they're in a criminal act, but I think
[02:25:14.700 --> 02:25:17.220]  that we need to support the fact that we've got a First Amendment right that has been
[02:25:17.220 --> 02:25:18.220]  violated here.
[02:25:18.220 --> 02:25:24.420]  I know that's your position, Alex, but I still think Adam needs to be very careful about
[02:25:24.420 --> 02:25:26.140]  how he approaches these acts.
[02:25:26.140 --> 02:25:27.140]  I agree.
[02:25:27.140 --> 02:25:30.220]  Even the Washington Post kind of dished a bunch of dirt on him.
[02:25:30.220 --> 02:25:33.280]  Not real dirt, but saying he's a provocateur, but admitted, well, it looks like his rights
[02:25:33.280 --> 02:25:34.280]  were violated.
[02:25:34.280 --> 02:25:38.120]  I mean, even they had to admit that, and people better get, if you don't support other people's
[02:25:38.120 --> 02:25:40.220]  rights, you're gonna lose yours.
[02:25:40.220 --> 02:25:41.220]  It's so elementary.
[02:25:41.220 --> 02:25:43.940]  Now, you were telling me during the break, this is a short segment, cuz you've run some
[02:25:43.940 --> 02:25:47.300]  of the biggest conservative organizations in the country, Joel, about back when you
[02:25:47.300 --> 02:25:49.380]  were in Washington in the 80s.
[02:25:49.380 --> 02:25:50.380]  Tell people what happened.
[02:25:50.380 --> 02:25:54.500]  I mean, to let people know, we don't say this to scare you, we do this to show you how illegal
[02:25:54.500 --> 02:25:55.500]  the government is.
[02:25:55.500 --> 02:25:59.420]  I mean, how it's been, it's out of control.
[02:25:59.420 --> 02:26:02.120]  Tell people what happened to you when they get back into this AP thing.
[02:26:02.120 --> 02:26:05.280]  This happened as chairman of the Conservative National Committee, and I had an office in
[02:26:05.280 --> 02:26:09.820]  Washington DC, and I was in communication with several of the liberty groups in El Salvador
[02:26:09.820 --> 02:26:11.540]  and Guatemala.
[02:26:11.540 --> 02:26:18.660]  And there was this young army major, reserve major, who was trying to influence the conservative
[02:26:18.660 --> 02:26:20.740]  groups, and I didn't trust him.
[02:26:20.740 --> 02:26:27.280]  And so I warned in a telephone call my compatriots down there in El Salvador that he's coming
[02:26:27.280 --> 02:26:30.840]  down to visit, but you better not trust him, and why I thought so.
[02:26:30.840 --> 02:26:36.660]  In 15 minutes, that guy was standing in front of my desk saying, don't you ever talk about
[02:26:36.660 --> 02:26:39.140]  me to anyone on the telephone.
[02:26:39.140 --> 02:26:41.340]  And he wasn't in your building, he was from the military.
[02:26:41.340 --> 02:26:42.340]  That's right.
[02:26:42.340 --> 02:26:44.680]  So they were listening right then, he drove right over.
[02:26:44.680 --> 02:26:45.680]  That's exactly right.
[02:26:45.680 --> 02:26:46.680]  So this was echelon.
[02:26:46.680 --> 02:26:51.060]  This is a satellite system that's surveilling any overseas communications, etc.
[02:26:51.060 --> 02:26:53.180]  And of course, this was purely domestic.
[02:26:53.180 --> 02:26:59.220]  This was my telephone and my rights were violated, they didn't have a warrant, of course, this
[02:26:59.220 --> 02:27:00.220]  happened instantaneously.
[02:27:00.220 --> 02:27:04.900]  You know, they didn't go before a judge, but it just told me right then they surveil everything
[02:27:04.900 --> 02:27:05.900]  now.
[02:27:05.900 --> 02:27:09.660]  Well, the congressman came out last week and said there they know the cloakroom's bugged.
[02:27:09.660 --> 02:27:11.620]  And he's like, is that impeachable?
[02:27:11.620 --> 02:27:13.580]  Does that rise to the level of impeachment?
[02:27:13.580 --> 02:27:17.220]  I mean, it's obviously a violation of the fourth, fifth amendment.
[02:27:17.220 --> 02:27:19.820]  It's obviously a violation of the tenth amendment.
[02:27:19.820 --> 02:27:22.540]  It's a violation of the states, the separation of powers.
[02:27:22.540 --> 02:27:24.980]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:27:24.980 --> 02:27:25.980]  Yeah.
[02:27:25.980 --> 02:27:31.180]  So the surveillance has gotten much worse even since my experience in 1983 because they
[02:27:31.180 --> 02:27:35.500]  were just doing telephones and the echelon system was only doing things that were wirelessly
[02:27:35.500 --> 02:27:37.620]  being transmitted around the world.
[02:27:37.620 --> 02:27:39.600]  But now they've got everything digitally.
[02:27:39.600 --> 02:27:48.500]  We have whistleblowers from the NSA talking about the ISP systems that the FBI has installed
[02:27:48.500 --> 02:27:54.580]  in every major node in the Internet so that every email, every digital cell phone, telephone
[02:27:54.580 --> 02:27:56.060]  call is being recorded.
[02:27:56.060 --> 02:27:59.380]  And all your web history, everything, and that was all in the Telecommunications Act
[02:27:59.380 --> 02:28:06.060]  of 96, but we were called conspiracy theorists to talk about saying the Statue of Liberty
[02:28:06.060 --> 02:28:07.060]  exists.
[02:28:07.060 --> 02:28:08.060]  I mean, we're talking about known facts.
[02:28:08.060 --> 02:28:11.380]  It's like Gibbs was told, say the drone program doesn't exist overseas.
[02:28:11.380 --> 02:28:13.780]  And he's like, but it's been public for years.
[02:28:13.780 --> 02:28:15.180]  Just say it doesn't exist.
[02:28:15.180 --> 02:28:17.460]  And the press played along with that.
[02:28:17.460 --> 02:28:21.380]  And the press better get, folks, if you go along with this purge, it's over.
[02:28:21.380 --> 02:28:27.460]  My answer is everybody needs to start whistleblowing in a swarm attack, which they're not gonna
[02:28:27.460 --> 02:28:28.460]  be able to handle.
[02:28:28.460 --> 02:28:32.660]  And we have to remember that the government itself covers all these leaks.
[02:28:32.660 --> 02:28:35.460]  In other words, there's no way that anybody leaks to the reporters.
[02:28:35.460 --> 02:28:41.060]  Many times they have prosecuted people during the Cheney-Bush administration for trying
[02:28:41.060 --> 02:28:42.060]  to get their sources.
[02:28:42.060 --> 02:28:45.460]  Well, they know who the sources are, but they can't admit that they know who the source
[02:28:45.460 --> 02:28:46.820]  is because they know they'd be.
[02:28:46.820 --> 02:28:47.820]  So they go to court.
[02:28:47.820 --> 02:28:53.500]  They try to get the courts, and the courts always lay down and do what the government
[02:28:53.500 --> 02:28:54.700]  wants.
[02:28:54.700 --> 02:28:56.220]  It's very, very interesting.
[02:28:56.220 --> 02:29:00.580]  But the leaks about government torture, the leaks about government surveillance were done,
[02:29:00.580 --> 02:29:03.420]  in my opinion, on purpose back in the Bush-Cheney administration.
[02:29:03.420 --> 02:29:04.820]  You gotta scare everybody.
[02:29:04.820 --> 02:29:06.560]  Well, not just to scare.
[02:29:06.560 --> 02:29:10.600]  What they did is give Congress an excuse to then react to it and say, well, we'd better
[02:29:10.600 --> 02:29:12.940]  give them some more authority to surveil.
[02:29:12.940 --> 02:29:15.020]  In other words, we leak a mistake.
[02:29:15.020 --> 02:29:16.020]  We say, we've got a problem.
[02:29:16.020 --> 02:29:18.900]  Well, because they're illegally doing it, how about we just get rid of the law?
[02:29:18.900 --> 02:29:21.140]  In fact, the New York Times said that last week.
[02:29:21.140 --> 02:29:24.340]  The answer is just get rid of any of it, yeah.
[02:29:24.340 --> 02:29:25.720]  We'll shove a microphone down your throat.
[02:29:25.720 --> 02:29:26.720]  Stay there.
[02:29:26.720 --> 02:29:27.720]  Let's come back.
[02:29:27.720 --> 02:29:28.720]  Long segment coming up.
[02:29:28.720 --> 02:29:30.420]  You're right, cuz that's exactly what they're saying.
[02:29:30.420 --> 02:29:31.860]  It's like, we committed a murder?
[02:29:31.860 --> 02:29:34.020]  We better legalize the murder then.
[02:29:34.020 --> 02:29:35.020]  Stay with us.
[02:29:35.020 --> 02:29:37.180]  World Affairs Brief Editor is in studio with us.

[02:31:03.900 --> 02:31:08.920]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[02:31:08.920 --> 02:31:14.940]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce

[02:33:20.860 --> 02:33:24.740]  You load 16 tons, what do you get?
[02:33:24.740 --> 02:33:27.420]  Another day older and deeper in depth.
[02:33:27.420 --> 02:33:30.900]  St. Peter don't you call me cause I can't go.
[02:33:30.900 --> 02:33:38.140]  I owe my soul to the company store.
[02:33:38.140 --> 02:33:43.380]  Ladies and gentlemen we're back live and we're going to get into the other scandals, Benghazi,
[02:33:43.380 --> 02:33:46.780]  arrest, all of it.
[02:33:46.780 --> 02:33:52.580]  And you know I guess Joel hasn't said what he thinks yet, he's not sure but I agree with
[02:33:52.580 --> 02:33:57.740]  him that they're certainly going to use these leaks coming out because they're now saying
[02:33:57.740 --> 02:33:58.740]  it.
[02:33:58.740 --> 02:34:02.960]  You know what, let's just get rid of warrants period, we're trying to keep you safe.
[02:34:02.960 --> 02:34:07.420]  But you read Glenn Greenwald and the London Guardian and others, they're pointing out
[02:34:07.420 --> 02:34:14.060]  that people they're arresting like Stephen Kim talked to the Fox News chief, Washington
[02:34:14.060 --> 02:34:16.220]  bureau chief, just publicly.
[02:34:16.220 --> 02:34:19.940]  He went there, talked to him, hey, you're the State Department person on this, what
[02:34:19.940 --> 02:34:25.380]  do you think Kim Jong-un might detonate more nukes to threaten people as underground tests?
[02:34:25.380 --> 02:34:28.140]  Yeah, we don't have any proof of that but that's kind of what we think.
[02:34:28.140 --> 02:34:30.300]  Well, you're arrested.
[02:34:30.300 --> 02:34:34.780]  And then now they're saying that, well, I tell you what, we might go after the Fox reporter
[02:34:34.780 --> 02:34:35.780]  for this.
[02:34:35.780 --> 02:34:42.060]  I mean, this is really just the brazen criminality of these people now where they're saying look,
[02:34:42.060 --> 02:34:45.140]  you don't even criticize anything or we'll come after you.
[02:34:45.140 --> 02:34:49.700]  But look at this, the impeachment option representative Jason Chaffetz, is that how you pronounce
[02:34:49.700 --> 02:34:50.700]  it?
[02:34:50.700 --> 02:34:56.260]  Chaffetz, a Utah Republican, says President Barack Obama may face impeachment over his
[02:34:56.260 --> 02:34:58.860]  administration's response to the Benghazi attack.
[02:34:58.860 --> 02:35:03.620]  Yeah, they've been caught lying there and the situation rooms all saw the drones, all
[02:35:03.620 --> 02:35:05.300]  saw the stand down.
[02:35:05.300 --> 02:35:09.340]  They know that, NATO knows that, and so that's what they're really scared of.
[02:35:09.340 --> 02:35:13.300]  But Joel, getting back now to what you've been trying to say in that last short segment,
[02:35:13.300 --> 02:35:18.140]  you were talking about how they're gonna try to pass stuff on the back of this.
[02:35:18.140 --> 02:35:23.180]  You've got the floor, get into the IRS stuff, the AP stuff, where you think it's going,
[02:35:23.180 --> 02:35:27.820]  and then finally Benghazi and where you think the New World Order is right now and what
[02:35:27.820 --> 02:35:33.980]  good people in government but just in the general public can do to really push these
[02:35:33.980 --> 02:35:34.980]  people back.
[02:35:34.980 --> 02:35:40.580]  Well, my two examples that I started out with were torture and the surveillance, domestic
[02:35:40.580 --> 02:35:43.000]  surveillance to get caught up in terrorism.
[02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:46.580]  And they were admitted, the government through the leaks that I think they caused, admitted
[02:35:46.580 --> 02:35:51.420]  both that they were doing torture, even though they tried to downplay it as something, and
[02:35:51.420 --> 02:35:55.580]  that they were surveilling in a limited way that was going beyond the law.
[02:35:55.580 --> 02:35:59.360]  And they tried to justify it with Congress so that they had predictable hacks in Congress
[02:35:59.360 --> 02:36:05.620]  to introduce immediately legislation allowing this expansion of torture, expansion of enhanced
[02:36:05.620 --> 02:36:07.660]  interrogation.
[02:36:07.660 --> 02:36:13.340]  And so there was this scenario where the government is using purposeful leaks.
[02:36:13.340 --> 02:36:16.740]  And I don't believe the government ever allows any leaks that they don't want out because
[02:36:16.740 --> 02:36:17.840]  they surveil everything.
[02:36:17.840 --> 02:36:18.840]  They can find out anything.
[02:36:18.840 --> 02:36:21.940]  They don't need to go to court to ever find out who a reporter's sources are.
[02:36:21.940 --> 02:36:24.620]  They surveil everything.
[02:36:24.620 --> 02:36:30.820]  But this appears, my first impression is that both the IRS leak is an inadvertent leak.
[02:36:30.820 --> 02:36:32.900]  And the reason I say that, it's been going on for decades.
[02:36:32.900 --> 02:36:33.900]  I agree with you.
[02:36:33.900 --> 02:36:35.860]  So you agree with me then?
[02:36:35.860 --> 02:36:36.860]  Yes.
[02:36:36.860 --> 02:36:41.400]  But the reason that I feel that is that Obama came out and his scriptwriters wrote in, but
[02:36:41.400 --> 02:36:44.460]  we must give the due respect to the IRS.
[02:36:44.460 --> 02:36:47.900]  I know they're very powerful, but we must not limit their power.
[02:36:47.900 --> 02:36:52.940]  In other words, he's trying to forestall anything in Congress that would limit the power of
[02:36:52.940 --> 02:36:53.940]  the IRS.
[02:36:53.940 --> 02:36:57.040]  Protect the IRS, not expand its authority.
[02:36:57.040 --> 02:36:59.540]  Don't do anything to stop.
[02:36:59.540 --> 02:37:01.220]  So I think that was inadvertent.
[02:37:01.220 --> 02:37:10.380]  I think the AP was inadvertent because it didn't appear to come from a direct government
[02:37:10.380 --> 02:37:11.700]  source.
[02:37:11.700 --> 02:37:15.780]  And it's not something I don't think they can expand.
[02:37:15.780 --> 02:37:19.260]  That is, they cannot expand and say, well, the press isn't gonna have the same rights
[02:37:19.260 --> 02:37:20.700]  that they are.
[02:37:20.700 --> 02:37:24.660]  What does the phenomenon mean, though, that, because I've argued with you, well, not really
[02:37:24.660 --> 02:37:27.700]  argue but talk to you about this, where you're saying, look, a lot of these leaks are fake
[02:37:27.700 --> 02:37:29.380]  or there's no way these people have real sources.
[02:37:29.380 --> 02:37:33.100]  I'm finding government people are mad and don't care anymore, and we're getting to the
[02:37:33.100 --> 02:37:35.020]  point where they're just willing to leak stuff.
[02:37:35.020 --> 02:37:38.580]  And okay, go ahead and put me in jail for exposing, you're a dirty crook.
[02:37:38.580 --> 02:37:42.820]  The problem with this is that after the AP leaked, the AP reporter said universally nobody
[02:37:42.820 --> 02:37:44.880]  wants to talk to us anymore.
[02:37:44.880 --> 02:37:46.580]  This is a real problem.
[02:37:46.580 --> 02:37:48.620]  So it is shutting down whistleblower, and that may be-
[02:37:48.620 --> 02:37:49.620]  Chilling effect.
[02:37:49.620 --> 02:37:51.480]  It's a chilling effect.
[02:37:51.480 --> 02:37:55.380]  Nobody dares talk because everybody realizes, every whistleblower now realizes that the
[02:37:55.380 --> 02:37:57.220]  press is being bugged.
[02:37:57.220 --> 02:37:58.220]  Now we knew it before.
[02:37:58.220 --> 02:38:01.160]  You know what the answer is, mail it to people.
[02:38:01.160 --> 02:38:08.060]  Mail it to infoawards.com, mail it to Drudge, put a other address or no address or whatever,
[02:38:08.060 --> 02:38:09.500]  and then get it to people.
[02:38:09.500 --> 02:38:10.500]  Isn't this interesting?
[02:38:10.500 --> 02:38:13.820]  I tell my clients to, if they're worried about privacy, look, everything you tell me in a
[02:38:13.820 --> 02:38:17.300]  conversation about your consultation is gonna be recorded.
[02:38:17.300 --> 02:38:18.580]  Everything is going to be talked about.
[02:38:18.580 --> 02:38:21.980]  Either you gotta fly me out there to talk about your private situation, or you gotta
[02:38:21.980 --> 02:38:22.980]  mail it to me.
[02:38:22.980 --> 02:38:28.740]  Isn't that ironic that the snail mail is now the safest, because it requires a human being
[02:38:28.740 --> 02:38:31.080]  to intervene in every letter that they open.
[02:38:31.080 --> 02:38:34.400]  And they've got the private offices at all the places where they take it, but still they're
[02:38:34.400 --> 02:38:37.220]  lazy and won't do it, and then they don't know what to do with the intelligence.
[02:38:37.220 --> 02:38:38.840]  So the answer is go back to snail mail.
[02:38:38.840 --> 02:38:43.140]  But if you go to snail mail and you introduce and you open it up, you've gotta photocopy,
[02:38:43.140 --> 02:38:44.140]  you've gotta scan it.
[02:38:44.140 --> 02:38:48.320]  I mean, it's a tremendous costly process, and the government's under sequester, even
[02:38:48.320 --> 02:38:52.300]  the CIA, who has black budget type of thing, doesn't wanna put a lot of money in it.
[02:38:52.300 --> 02:38:54.060]  Well, how does France communicate with itself?
[02:38:54.060 --> 02:38:59.220]  It has the pneumatic tubes, that's the right term, the pressure tubes, and that's under
[02:38:59.220 --> 02:39:03.100]  their sewers, how the government sends its info, knowing that's gonna be hard to scan
[02:39:03.100 --> 02:39:04.380]  with satellite.
[02:39:04.380 --> 02:39:06.460]  No, that's right, and it's physical.
[02:39:06.460 --> 02:39:09.900]  I mean, anything digital just isn't safe anymore.
[02:39:09.900 --> 02:39:11.460]  That doesn't mean that you shouldn't.
[02:39:11.460 --> 02:39:12.620]  You shouldn't stop all communication.
[02:39:12.620 --> 02:39:15.380]  Yeah, well, then they say, well, what do you have to hide?
[02:39:15.380 --> 02:39:17.660]  Well, why is government so secret?
[02:39:17.660 --> 02:39:21.260]  Because you're a criminal government that wants to use, who I've really been told by
[02:39:21.260 --> 02:39:23.820]  high level sources they spy on, is inventors in people.
[02:39:23.820 --> 02:39:26.580]  I mean, the poor folks get everything stolen.
[02:39:26.580 --> 02:39:30.820]  I mean, and American companies, why are they trying to shut down American companies?
[02:39:30.820 --> 02:39:34.060]  They do everything they can.
[02:39:34.060 --> 02:39:35.980]  That's a hard question, Alex.
[02:39:35.980 --> 02:39:41.620]  I think they want us dependent on China more, they wanna drive people overseas.
[02:39:41.620 --> 02:39:46.100]  They want us, so that when this, and my theory is that they're setting us up for eventual
[02:39:46.100 --> 02:39:48.820]  nuclear war, that's when the real curtain comes down.
[02:39:48.820 --> 02:39:51.020]  They can justify anything at that time.
[02:39:51.020 --> 02:39:54.820]  They wanna make sure that we don't have any ability to respond to the war, so they can
[02:39:54.820 --> 02:39:57.940]  say you've got to go to a militarized new world order.
[02:39:57.940 --> 02:40:00.740]  It's globally that we've gotta fight this next war.
[02:40:00.740 --> 02:40:03.600]  We don't wanna have America rejuvenated as if-
[02:40:03.600 --> 02:40:09.020]  Exactly, I wanna get to Benghazi with you, but the army has come out and said, we don't
[02:40:09.020 --> 02:40:12.200]  need the president for authorization to quell civil disturbances.
[02:40:12.200 --> 02:40:16.260]  Is that so they can start doing it routinely, like they already are, and not have it be
[02:40:16.260 --> 02:40:17.920]  a big presidential deal?
[02:40:17.920 --> 02:40:21.780]  But then there's the issue of, they're already saying the military is under NATO.
[02:40:21.780 --> 02:40:28.040]  Is this like some type of weird quasi announcement of a military industrial complex, pure coup?
[02:40:28.040 --> 02:40:29.540]  Or what do you think's behind that?
[02:40:29.540 --> 02:40:35.700]  NATO is to become the militarized order of the globalists, and that's why everything
[02:40:35.700 --> 02:40:38.820]  from Eisenhower on was to get France.
[02:40:38.820 --> 02:40:42.980]  Tikal didn't wanna be part of NATO, didn't wanna supply troops, to twist his arm to get
[02:40:42.980 --> 02:40:45.820]  Eisenhower to reform the German troops and things.
[02:40:45.820 --> 02:40:50.840]  But it was because NATO is gonna be the military arm of the new world order, and they are gonna
[02:40:50.840 --> 02:40:55.100]  cut off the communist nations that are part of the United Nations, reform, call it the
[02:40:55.100 --> 02:40:59.060]  League of Democracies or some more innocuous name.
[02:40:59.060 --> 02:41:03.400]  So to get American support after they've been nuked or after various military cities have
[02:41:03.400 --> 02:41:04.400]  been nuked.
[02:41:04.400 --> 02:41:08.480]  I do not believe that the Russians and Chinese are gonna nuke everything in the United States.
[02:41:08.480 --> 02:41:10.240]  They don't wanna be looked as the bully of the world.
[02:41:10.240 --> 02:41:13.620]  They're taking down the bully of the world, but they want blackmail.
[02:41:13.620 --> 02:41:14.620]  They want to-
[02:41:14.620 --> 02:41:18.780]  But may they back up because they're ten years behind in the Anglo-American plan.
[02:41:18.780 --> 02:41:25.140]  And I mean, it came out in mainstream news that Assad reads Infowars.com.
[02:41:25.140 --> 02:41:27.660]  And the foreign government's too listen to this show as well.
[02:41:27.660 --> 02:41:28.660]  And they read what you're doing.
[02:41:28.660 --> 02:41:29.660]  We're not bragging, folks.
[02:41:29.660 --> 02:41:31.460]  It's just there's not many of us that know what's going on.
[02:41:31.460 --> 02:41:33.140]  It's really kind of scary.
[02:41:33.140 --> 02:41:37.140]  But I mean, are the Chinese gonna really be manipulated into that and the Russians?
[02:41:37.140 --> 02:41:43.780]  Well, they want to take down, you see, they've always had this philosophy that we are superior
[02:41:43.780 --> 02:41:44.780]  to the West.
[02:41:44.780 --> 02:41:47.180]  We're going to have to take them down a little bit, but they don't wanna destroy the West.
[02:41:47.180 --> 02:41:50.460]  They know the West is the engine of ingenuity.
[02:41:50.460 --> 02:41:55.100]  They depend on that for all their military, but they wanna control it, not just have to
[02:41:55.100 --> 02:41:56.100]  spy on it.
[02:41:56.100 --> 02:41:58.200]  That's why they wanna nuke the military of the US.
[02:41:58.200 --> 02:42:02.500]  The US wants its own military nuke because it drives Americans into accepting a new world
[02:42:02.500 --> 02:42:04.940]  order, a militarized new world order.
[02:42:04.940 --> 02:42:09.260]  But the Russians and Chinese don't wanna destroy either Europe or America totally.
[02:42:09.260 --> 02:42:11.940]  They wanna decapitate the military.
[02:42:11.940 --> 02:42:16.900]  They wanna take down the US socially with an EMP strike, which will happen about 20
[02:42:16.900 --> 02:42:22.260]  minutes before the actual nuclear strike on American military targets and communication
[02:42:22.260 --> 02:42:23.380]  targets.
[02:42:23.380 --> 02:42:29.520]  And then they'll issue a blackmail notice, give up, and everyone will be acceptable to
[02:42:29.520 --> 02:42:34.000]  that, literally, in the sense that what is there now that the military, but our leaders
[02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:36.660]  will come out of their bunkers and say, no, no.
[02:42:36.660 --> 02:42:41.300]  The Russians and Chinese deceived us, and finally, they'll have the gumption to say,
[02:42:41.300 --> 02:42:42.980]  we need to fight.
[02:42:42.980 --> 02:42:47.860]  And everything the US puts out about China now is pacifistic, no, it's not a problem.
[02:42:47.860 --> 02:42:52.020]  And they know that everybody will line up and then the secret weapons roll out and it's
[02:42:52.020 --> 02:42:54.140]  the real deal and we take over the world.
[02:42:54.140 --> 02:42:57.940]  But now it's a fascist Anglo-American eugenics-based new world order.
[02:42:57.940 --> 02:42:59.280]  That's right.
[02:42:59.280 --> 02:43:01.900]  And all of this is leading up that we're talking about.
[02:43:01.900 --> 02:43:05.380]  We're seeing the preparation for martial law, we're seeing the preparation for camps that
[02:43:05.380 --> 02:43:06.380]  are being established.
[02:43:06.380 --> 02:43:09.060]  And for 20 year wars, I mean, they're long hauling.
[02:43:09.060 --> 02:43:10.060]  That's right.
[02:43:10.060 --> 02:43:12.020]  Seed bunkers, underground bases.
[02:43:12.020 --> 02:43:16.280]  But you know, I am resisting the call that this is imminent because they're very smart
[02:43:16.280 --> 02:43:17.660]  that we're dealing with.
[02:43:17.660 --> 02:43:22.560]  This is preparatory, and when it is unleashed, they've gotta have a proper excuse or they
[02:43:22.560 --> 02:43:26.080]  convince the whole world that the government is tyrannical.
[02:43:26.080 --> 02:43:30.940]  But if they do it under the cover of war, after this nuclear weapon strike comes, then
[02:43:30.940 --> 02:43:33.740]  nobody questions martial law.
[02:43:33.740 --> 02:43:34.940]  Nobody questions any of it.
[02:43:34.940 --> 02:43:39.580]  Just like in Boston, the people laid down and let people strip them of their rights,
[02:43:39.580 --> 02:43:41.700]  take them out of the house and throw them to the ground without any-
[02:43:41.700 --> 02:43:45.460]  Sure, you know it came out in the 60s that the Russians wanted to nuke China with the
[02:43:45.460 --> 02:43:46.460]  US.
[02:43:46.460 --> 02:43:50.020]  And then the US said no, because it already really made a deal with the communist Chinese,
[02:43:50.020 --> 02:43:51.860]  kind of like helping put Mao in power.
[02:43:51.860 --> 02:43:57.000]  I mean, it seems like the globalists have kind of got a double game though, that I mean,
[02:43:57.000 --> 02:44:00.300]  they're moving to China, they're investing there, they're doing everything they can.
[02:44:00.300 --> 02:44:03.620]  But is that really the trick then, cuz they're just giving America to the Chinese.
[02:44:03.620 --> 02:44:11.460]  Well, a lot of people, there is this conflict within theoretical, how globalism operates.
[02:44:11.460 --> 02:44:14.900]  One side says because of the Rowan Gaither quotes to Norman Dodd that we're trying to
[02:44:14.900 --> 02:44:20.980]  seamlessly join the US with the American Republic, is that the globalists control the Russians
[02:44:20.980 --> 02:44:23.500]  and the Chinese and therefore- Sure, that's the Carnegie plan.
[02:44:23.500 --> 02:44:25.420]  Yeah, there's not gonna be war, but it's not true.
[02:44:25.420 --> 02:44:28.760]  In fact, Rowan Gaither was lying to Norman Dodd, he never would have admitted the real
[02:44:28.760 --> 02:44:29.760]  thing.
[02:44:29.760 --> 02:44:33.020]  He had a cover excuse to explain to them in some rational way.
[02:44:33.020 --> 02:44:38.100]  In fact, Rowan Gaither of the Ford Foundation had invited the investigator to come and get
[02:44:38.100 --> 02:44:39.100]  an interview.
[02:44:39.100 --> 02:44:40.100]  That's right, Ford Foundation.
[02:44:40.100 --> 02:44:42.580]  It wasn't that he was responding to a subpoena.
[02:44:42.580 --> 02:44:46.360]  He invited him to come and give him the propaganda that we're trying to peacefully merge the
[02:44:46.360 --> 02:44:47.360]  two countries.
[02:44:47.360 --> 02:44:53.340]  But in fact, the globalists don't control the Russians, they're trying to induce them
[02:44:53.340 --> 02:44:58.020]  by giving them aid, giving them trade, and the Russians and Chinese are skittish.
[02:44:58.020 --> 02:45:02.060]  They're deathly afraid that we've got secret weapon systems they don't now know about and
[02:45:02.060 --> 02:45:04.340]  they're afraid to- Well, I've talked to Bob Bowman and many others,
[02:45:04.340 --> 02:45:07.140]  they can talk about what's been accidentally leaked in debates and things.
[02:45:07.140 --> 02:45:12.900]  They had the Star Wars program in the 70s and Shabo drones in orbit and just everything
[02:45:12.900 --> 02:45:13.900]  else.
[02:45:13.900 --> 02:45:15.700]  I mean, it's- That's right, and that's why the Chinese are
[02:45:15.700 --> 02:45:18.100]  really working on anti-satellite.
[02:45:18.100 --> 02:45:19.820]  That's right, that's their main program.
[02:45:19.820 --> 02:45:23.780]  They're still eight to 10 years out about having the confidence to strike the West,
[02:45:23.780 --> 02:45:25.980]  and that's why I don't think it's imminent.
[02:45:25.980 --> 02:45:29.620]  But they don't control the Chinese, they're going to make a deal with the Chinese in my
[02:45:29.620 --> 02:45:34.340]  opinion when the Russians and Chinese in a temporary alliance strike the West.
[02:45:34.340 --> 02:45:38.580]  And when we start this new world order war, this great new patriotic war that they'll
[02:45:38.580 --> 02:45:44.340]  try to get in one enthusiastic about prosecuting, then I think they'll make a deal with China
[02:45:44.340 --> 02:45:50.980]  to attack Russia's rear just as China and Russia or China, I'm sorry, Russia and Hitler
[02:45:50.980 --> 02:45:52.700]  went after one another.
[02:45:52.700 --> 02:45:57.980]  And we used Russia knowing that they would be a predator and gave them aid in trade.
[02:45:57.980 --> 02:46:00.820]  I think we'll lure China in with that same thing.
[02:46:00.820 --> 02:46:04.700]  And the globalists want that because, you see, after the war, instead of like World
[02:46:04.700 --> 02:46:08.060]  War II where they gave sovereignty back to the US and all the countries wanted to be
[02:46:08.060 --> 02:46:13.420]  independent again, they'll have this great new enemy, China, that they built up and say,
[02:46:13.420 --> 02:46:18.980]  now we can't disband the military new world order army because we've got this great threat.
[02:46:18.980 --> 02:46:22.600]  And so that's why I think the one thing that will be different in World War III is we
[02:46:22.600 --> 02:46:23.600]  won't get sovereignty-
[02:46:23.600 --> 02:46:27.340]  And they're enticing the Chinese, not just all the deep water ports in the Caribbean
[02:46:27.340 --> 02:46:31.980]  and the West Coast and the East Coast and not just the big Mexican ports, but they're
[02:46:31.980 --> 02:46:38.300]  giving them just the entire infrastructure, 90, I saw a number of 98% of rare earth minerals,
[02:46:38.300 --> 02:46:40.420]  it was like 90% five years ago.
[02:46:40.420 --> 02:46:45.700]  They're just enticing, just come, come, just to ever, here, have it all.
[02:46:45.700 --> 02:46:51.780]  And I always look at it as just a globalist hatred of America, hatred of Christians, really
[02:46:51.780 --> 02:46:53.740]  the spirit of evil that animates them.
[02:46:53.740 --> 02:46:57.060]  And I'd warn the globalist, the Anglo-Americans, I don't think you're gonna get away with this.
[02:46:57.060 --> 02:47:00.860]  I don't think it's gonna turn out the way they think because they've got all these thousands
[02:47:00.860 --> 02:47:04.660]  of bio labs just randomly splicing genetics.
[02:47:04.660 --> 02:47:08.220]  I don't think they're in control like they think they are, I think there's gonna be catastrophes
[02:47:08.220 --> 02:47:09.540]  they don't even control.
[02:47:09.540 --> 02:47:13.580]  There will be a loss of control once this nuclear war starts, probably for at least
[02:47:13.580 --> 02:47:15.940]  a year and a half, maybe two years.
[02:47:15.940 --> 02:47:20.260]  That's the time for America to reform in the liberty movement.
[02:47:20.260 --> 02:47:23.820]  And that's why strategic relocation is so important because you can't do it like we're
[02:47:23.820 --> 02:47:24.820]  now.
[02:47:24.820 --> 02:47:28.380]  We're now spread out all over the United States, everybody's alone, everybody feels alone.
[02:47:28.380 --> 02:47:34.540]  Somehow, and I think it's through the instrumentality of war, the Lord is gonna drive people together,
[02:47:34.540 --> 02:47:36.100]  drive people out of the big cities.
[02:47:36.100 --> 02:47:40.860]  It won't mean a job to keep you there anymore, no excuse not to relocate.
[02:47:40.860 --> 02:47:44.780]  Just that if you didn't do it prior to that, you're gonna be out on the roads with masses
[02:47:44.780 --> 02:47:47.100]  of people like in Germany fleeing from the Russians.
[02:47:47.100 --> 02:47:48.100]  That's not what you're-
[02:47:48.100 --> 02:47:52.580]  They say it's kooky to get ready and geared up, all governments doing is gearing up, acting
[02:47:52.580 --> 02:47:53.780]  like it's the end of the world.
[02:47:53.780 --> 02:47:57.620]  Deep underground bunkers, this is not against terror that they're preparing, they know there's
[02:47:57.620 --> 02:47:58.620]  a nuclear-
[02:47:58.620 --> 02:48:01.580]  And they know when they emerge, their enemy's gonna be the liberty movement, they're preparing
[02:48:01.580 --> 02:48:05.460]  the giant cadres, no longer secret armies for war with us.
[02:48:05.460 --> 02:48:06.580]  That's right.
[02:48:06.580 --> 02:48:09.820]  And they're not gonna, and of course, not gonna make a deal with us to stop this cuz
[02:48:09.820 --> 02:48:10.820]  they hate us.
[02:48:10.820 --> 02:48:13.340]  Yeah, that's right, there's no deal to make.
[02:48:13.340 --> 02:48:16.460]  They know that this is gonna be an absolute separation between good and evil.
[02:48:16.460 --> 02:48:19.820]  Well, I take it back, there's an awful lot of dumbed down people who will be dumbed down
[02:48:19.820 --> 02:48:22.660]  because of the false patriotism of this war.
[02:48:22.660 --> 02:48:23.660]  They won't realize this is a global-
[02:48:23.660 --> 02:48:25.340]  Well, they'll be cannon fodder.
[02:48:25.340 --> 02:48:28.900]  They'll be cannon fodder and they'll join the military and that's why I don't recommend
[02:48:28.900 --> 02:48:31.820]  any more of our boys and girls go into the military.
[02:48:31.820 --> 02:48:35.020]  Not only because of the deadly vaccines that you're required to take, but because you're
[02:48:35.020 --> 02:48:37.580]  not fighting to save America's liberties.
[02:48:37.580 --> 02:48:42.720]  Even though they tell you that, you're not fighting for democracy in Syria or Iran, you're
[02:48:42.720 --> 02:48:45.700]  fighting for a globalist agenda that the US government is-
[02:48:45.700 --> 02:48:46.700]  Well, that was my next question.
[02:48:46.700 --> 02:48:49.180]  I wanna get into Benghazi, Joel Scousins, our guest.
[02:48:49.180 --> 02:48:54.240]  Isn't it an overload point, though, where they're in the Washington Post and the London
[02:48:54.240 --> 02:49:00.220]  Telegraph going, the bin Laden brigade is leading, Al-Qaeda is doing a great job fighting
[02:49:00.220 --> 02:49:04.680]  Assad, he's got the oil, and I'm like, and then when you fly, they treat you like you're
[02:49:04.680 --> 02:49:05.680]  bin Laden.
[02:49:05.680 --> 02:49:12.260]  I mean, how do they get away with this otherworldly absurdistness that's now going on where our
[02:49:12.260 --> 02:49:13.900]  government runs Al-Qaeda publicly?
[02:49:13.900 --> 02:49:18.460]  I just- Well, we know that government has always had
[02:49:18.460 --> 02:49:19.460]  their fingers on Al-Qaeda.
[02:49:19.460 --> 02:49:22.980]  They started Al-Qaeda essentially as funding it through the Saudis.
[02:49:22.980 --> 02:49:27.780]  They've used the Pakistani ISI as well to fund another branch of Al-Qaeda.
[02:49:27.780 --> 02:49:30.660]  And even though there's a lot of legitimate terrorists who hate the United States that
[02:49:30.660 --> 02:49:35.660]  we have bred, as Ron Paul correctly stated, nevertheless, the top levels are directed.
[02:49:35.660 --> 02:49:41.340]  That's why in 9-11, yes, there were terrorists, but they were known to the United States military-
[02:49:41.340 --> 02:49:42.340]  Projected.
[02:49:42.340 --> 02:49:46.420]  And they were protected, they were trained, they'd been on CAIA bases before-
[02:49:46.420 --> 02:49:50.500]  I talked to the head of the US Embassy visa section, they were ordered a lot of men.
[02:49:50.500 --> 02:49:54.300]  That's right, and they got aircraft training and large aircraft in Saudi Arabia.
[02:49:54.300 --> 02:49:57.900]  They didn't get it at the flying sessions, that was a cover story.
[02:49:57.900 --> 02:50:01.500]  So as to shield the Saudis from somebody had to train those people in-
[02:50:01.500 --> 02:50:05.780]  And then we don't attack Saudi Arabia, we attack Iraq.
[02:50:05.780 --> 02:50:10.500]  Well, Saudi Arabia, we have this incestuous relationship with Saudi Arabia, we have promised
[02:50:10.500 --> 02:50:11.500]  them protection.
[02:50:11.500 --> 02:50:16.460]  They're a very corrupt regime, they claim to be Islamist fundamentalists with their
[02:50:16.460 --> 02:50:20.020]  form of sharia law there, but they aren't.
[02:50:20.020 --> 02:50:21.660]  They're pedophiles, they are-
[02:50:21.660 --> 02:50:24.560]  Well, I mean, it's a Wahhabist death cult.
[02:50:24.560 --> 02:50:28.540]  And if you expand on that, I guess, why did the British choose them?
[02:50:28.540 --> 02:50:30.580]  I guess those are the worst of the Muslims?
[02:50:30.580 --> 02:50:35.180]  Well, it's because they had the biggest oil first, and they made a deal.
[02:50:35.180 --> 02:50:39.260]  Basically, yeah, you can nationalize it, but you've got to make sure that you supply us
[02:50:39.260 --> 02:50:42.780]  and you use dollars, and they will continue to do so.
[02:50:42.780 --> 02:50:47.180]  Sure, but I mean, and of course, I guess they could use the Wahhabist to take over all of
[02:50:47.180 --> 02:50:51.780]  the Sunnis, and then use that in a war against the Shiites, it's just all divide and conquer
[02:50:51.780 --> 02:50:52.780]  crap.
[02:50:52.780 --> 02:50:53.780]  Yeah.
[02:50:53.780 --> 02:50:56.260]  We'll be right back with Joel Scales, we're gonna get into Benghazi straight ahead, ladies
[02:50:56.260 --> 02:50:58.980]  and gentlemen, I'm Alex Jones, stay with us.
[02:50:58.980 --> 02:51:05.980]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the bestselling book Cancer Step Outside the Box.

[02:52:29.060 --> 02:52:31.540]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:52:31.540 --> 02:52:35.340]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors want to talk about gold
[02:52:35.340 --> 02:52:36.340]  IRAs?
[02:52:36.340 --> 02:52:40.380]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value
[02:52:40.380 --> 02:52:42.060]  of gold for your retirement.
[02:52:42.060 --> 02:52:45.540]  Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:52:45.540 --> 02:52:50.540]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:52:50.540 --> 02:52:56.380]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns, call 800-686-2237.
[02:52:56.380 --> 02:53:01.340]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:53:01.340 --> 02:53:05.580]  There's been a disaster and most of you don't even realize the terrible danger we're in.
[02:53:05.580 --> 02:53:09.220]  Alex Jones has warned you for years to get a good food storage.
[02:53:09.220 --> 02:53:14.220]  We thought the danger was drought, or food delivered to our gas tanks, or our food sold
[02:53:14.220 --> 02:53:19.260]  to other countries, or food so expensive that only those on food stamps and welfare could
[02:53:19.260 --> 02:53:20.260]  afford it.
[02:53:20.260 --> 02:53:25.140]  But we have just experienced the most effective way to lose your freedom, liberty and security
[02:53:25.140 --> 02:53:26.940]  without even a fight.
[02:53:26.940 --> 02:53:28.420]  Government regulation.
[02:53:28.420 --> 02:53:34.240]  After a 160-year tradition of self-reliance, the do-it-yourself and charitable Mormon food
[02:53:34.240 --> 02:53:39.580]  storage canneries in half the country are forced to shut down due to excessive government
[02:53:39.580 --> 02:53:40.860]  regulations.
[02:53:40.860 --> 02:53:43.340]  Grow your own food, more regulations.
[02:53:43.340 --> 02:53:46.940]  If you've ever been warned to get food while you can, this is it.
[02:53:46.940 --> 02:53:52.820]  Call 800-409-5633 or on the web efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[02:53:52.820 --> 02:54:15.620]  Call 800-409-5633 or on the web efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[02:54:22.820 --> 02:54:31.220]  All right, we're gonna go a little bit into overdrive.
[02:54:31.220 --> 02:54:36.580]  Adam Kokesh, activist, has been charged with resisting arrest from his people, assaulting
[02:54:36.580 --> 02:54:41.260]  a federal god, I mean officer, impeding a federal officer.
[02:54:41.260 --> 02:54:45.680]  And he's gonna be detained at the Fed Center till Thursday due to denial to tell authorities
[02:54:45.680 --> 02:54:49.300]  where his house is located and whether there are firearms present in his home.
[02:54:49.300 --> 02:54:52.940]  So they are the feds, he went on federal land, a federal park.
[02:54:52.940 --> 02:54:53.940]  They grabbed him.
[02:54:53.940 --> 02:54:54.940]  We're gonna get to that in the next segment.
[02:54:54.940 --> 02:54:55.940]  I warned him.
[02:54:55.940 --> 02:54:57.940]  I said, man, they're coming after you.
[02:54:57.940 --> 02:55:00.620]  And he's lucky, and I'm not saying it's a good thing this happened.
[02:55:00.620 --> 02:55:02.540]  He's lucky they didn't do worse.
[02:55:02.540 --> 02:55:06.460]  I mean, you start doing stuff that could really upset their apple cart, cuz they don't want
[02:55:06.460 --> 02:55:07.460]  a shooting war to start.
[02:55:07.460 --> 02:55:08.460]  They'll lose that.
[02:55:08.460 --> 02:55:11.260]  I don't want it either, cuz it would really turn into a big problem for everybody.
[02:55:11.260 --> 02:55:15.140]  But Joel, Benghazi, we'll talk more about it tonight on the Nightly News.
[02:55:15.140 --> 02:55:17.900]  But I mean Benghazi, what's at the core of that?
[02:55:17.900 --> 02:55:20.620]  Well, the core is covering up for the stand down.
[02:55:20.620 --> 02:55:21.980]  Let me go back to the actual thing.
[02:55:21.980 --> 02:55:27.180]  We have an arms trading going on where they had captured a lot of arms in the takedown
[02:55:27.180 --> 02:55:28.860]  of the Libyan government.
[02:55:28.860 --> 02:55:35.100]  They were funneling those arms to the Syrian Free Army, which is now a jihadist, and as
[02:55:35.100 --> 02:55:39.620]  we know, calls themselves the Bin Laden Brigade.
[02:55:39.620 --> 02:55:41.480]  Supposedly our enemies, but we're arming them.
[02:55:41.480 --> 02:55:43.280]  And this was top secret.
[02:55:43.280 --> 02:55:47.340]  There are competitors, however, who wanted those arms for their own purposes in Libya
[02:55:47.340 --> 02:55:49.100]  and they attacked the embassy.
[02:55:49.100 --> 02:55:54.860]  I do not believe in the blind, chic thing that James Lyon, the admiral who was present
[02:55:54.860 --> 02:55:58.380]  there has been fed as the reason that that was really going down.
[02:55:58.380 --> 02:56:05.340]  The story is that Obama, it's like an October surprise, Obama's advisors were gonna make
[02:56:05.340 --> 02:56:10.060]  him popular by having him get involved in getting the release of a hostage, which was
[02:56:10.060 --> 02:56:12.460]  to be this ambassador.
[02:56:12.460 --> 02:56:17.620]  And they were going to basically let these Al Qaeda people capture the ambassador.
[02:56:17.620 --> 02:56:22.740]  Then they were gonna negotiate and they were gonna get the blind chic released, which the
[02:56:22.740 --> 02:56:23.740]  government could have done anytime.
[02:56:23.740 --> 02:56:24.860]  Do you believe that or not believe it?
[02:56:24.860 --> 02:56:25.860]  I do not believe it.
[02:56:25.860 --> 02:56:30.900]  The reason I don't believe it is because it would have been very easy and less lethal
[02:56:30.900 --> 02:56:34.740]  to set it up so the ambassador on the way to this annex was captured.
[02:56:34.740 --> 02:56:37.140]  Well, of course, and too much could go wrong.
[02:56:37.140 --> 02:56:38.300]  What do you really think happened?
[02:56:38.300 --> 02:56:40.100]  I think they were transferring missiles.
[02:56:40.100 --> 02:56:41.620]  They wanted to cover it up.
[02:56:41.620 --> 02:56:43.140]  That's right.
[02:56:43.140 --> 02:56:47.740]  And they knew that if the ambassador survived, there would be a congressional investigation
[02:56:47.740 --> 02:56:48.740]  on this.
[02:56:48.740 --> 02:56:51.540]  And this guy was apparently, even though he was knowledgeable of what he was doing, he
[02:56:51.540 --> 02:56:55.360]  was taking orders, a good yes man to the government, he would have talked.
[02:56:55.360 --> 02:56:58.420]  So they decided to let him die, let everybody die.
[02:56:58.420 --> 02:57:00.500]  And that's why there was a stand on order.
[02:57:00.500 --> 02:57:06.860]  Don't let any reinforcements, unfortunately, about 30 people survived, wounded from that
[02:57:06.860 --> 02:57:09.500]  who didn't die in that and they could have talked as well.
[02:57:09.500 --> 02:57:13.700]  That's the only reason to explain why they took him to Walter Reed, after Germany, to
[02:57:13.700 --> 02:57:17.140]  Walter Reed Army Medical Center and kept them in Comunecado.
[02:57:17.140 --> 02:57:20.340]  Meaning that they aren't allowed to talk to the press, even your family-
[02:57:20.340 --> 02:57:23.220]  Well, exactly, but I watched Hicks and others.
[02:57:23.220 --> 02:57:25.620]  They were freaked out, they were angry.
[02:57:25.620 --> 02:57:27.020]  Those were real testimonies.
[02:57:27.020 --> 02:57:28.820]  Those weren't the witnesses that I'm talking to.
[02:57:28.820 --> 02:57:30.600]  No, I understand, there's others.
[02:57:30.600 --> 02:57:35.920]  Those are mild whistleblowers and Greg Hicks did a good job talking about the stand down.
[02:57:35.920 --> 02:57:40.300]  But you'll notice that he says, I don't know who issued the order to General, it wasn't
[02:57:40.300 --> 02:57:41.300]  General Hamm.
[02:57:41.300 --> 02:57:42.760]  Yeah, so where are the 30 people?
[02:57:42.760 --> 02:57:43.760]  You never hear that in the press.
[02:57:43.760 --> 02:57:44.820]  No, no, and that's right.
[02:57:44.820 --> 02:57:46.820]  The 30 people are still in Comunecado.
[02:57:46.820 --> 02:57:50.360]  They're not coming before, and Congress is not demanding that they come before them.
[02:57:50.360 --> 02:57:51.700]  They know what was going on.
[02:57:51.700 --> 02:57:56.620]  My goodness, I knew that and it's just hiding in plain view, but I hadn't covered it.
[02:57:56.620 --> 02:57:58.940]  A lot of people thought, well, Greg Hicks and others are the whistleblowers.
[02:57:58.940 --> 02:58:00.000]  No, they aren't.
[02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:01.000]  They're mild whistleblowers.
[02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:05.180]  They aren't the ones that are really trying to keep away, who were there during the attack,
[02:58:05.180 --> 02:58:08.500]  who knew about the stand down, who knew about the orders.
[02:58:08.500 --> 02:58:12.700]  And the point is General Hamm knows because he was replaced.
[02:58:12.700 --> 02:58:16.860]  And Gibson knows who got the stand door and he isn't telling who actually told him.
[02:58:16.860 --> 02:58:20.580]  Well, folks, get the film Strategic Relocation that we produced with Joel Scowles and it's

[03:00:05.900 --> 03:00:10.700]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[03:00:10.700 --> 03:00:11.700]  You want answers?
[03:00:11.700 --> 03:00:13.820]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:13.820 --> 03:00:18.020]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:18.020 --> 03:00:28.980]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:28.980 --> 03:00:43.100]  Hey, folks, we're on air.
[03:00:43.100 --> 03:00:45.900]  Lucas Jewell is joining us.
[03:00:45.900 --> 03:00:46.980]  We're now into overdrive.
[03:00:46.980 --> 03:00:48.940]  Joel Skousen's riding shotgun with us.
[03:00:48.940 --> 03:00:54.100]  Lucas Jewell works as one of the radio slash TV producers for Adam Kokesh, and now it's
[03:00:54.100 --> 03:00:55.100]  getting serious.
[03:00:55.100 --> 03:00:58.420]  He wanted the armed march, peaceful march, civil disobedience on DC.
[03:00:58.420 --> 03:01:02.660]  And I'd point out that the federal Supreme Court ruled five years ago or four and a half
[03:01:02.660 --> 03:01:06.780]  years ago that you can have guns there, but still they don't allow it.
[03:01:06.780 --> 03:01:11.020]  And now he's been charged with three things and won't even be going to court, I guess,
[03:01:11.020 --> 03:01:12.260]  until Thursday.
[03:01:12.260 --> 03:01:14.300]  That's the info Lucas Jewell sent us.
[03:01:14.300 --> 03:01:15.500]  Lucas, thanks for joining us.
[03:01:15.500 --> 03:01:17.060]  This is some bad news.
[03:01:17.060 --> 03:01:19.020]  Wow, the feds are really out of control.
[03:01:19.020 --> 03:01:22.260]  It makes me not even want to go on federal property.
[03:01:22.260 --> 03:01:25.260]  They grabbed, he had his hands up, didn't resist, they could do that to me.
[03:01:25.260 --> 03:01:30.740]  I mean, I guess next, punch you in the nose and say you assaulted them.
[03:01:30.740 --> 03:01:31.740]  What's happening, Lucas Jewell?
[03:01:31.740 --> 03:01:41.140]  No, as you just said, Adam, it's a very, I don't even, whatever the negative adjective
[03:01:41.140 --> 03:01:45.860]  you could think of right now, because we are basically coming here to pick up Adam.
[03:01:45.860 --> 03:01:52.700]  We were talking to a legal team and supposedly they thought that he was going to be released
[03:01:52.700 --> 03:01:54.660]  on his own with cognizance.
[03:01:54.660 --> 03:02:01.780]  But the prosecutor pointed out that Adam refused to speak on whether or not he owned firearms.
[03:02:01.780 --> 03:02:06.180]  And that was one of the reasons for- Yeah, they're going to go confiscate your
[03:02:06.180 --> 03:02:07.180]  guns.
[03:02:07.180 --> 03:02:11.300]  They're going to engage you next, and then you might fall down and hit your head.
[03:02:11.300 --> 03:02:12.300]  Do what?
[03:02:12.300 --> 03:02:17.020]  I said, well, we're going back to the house soon, so they might have a confrontation on
[03:02:17.020 --> 03:02:20.900]  their hands if they want to do that.
[03:02:20.900 --> 03:02:21.900]  Oh, really?
[03:02:21.900 --> 03:02:24.060]  You know, these guys are all a bunch of former Marines.
[03:02:24.060 --> 03:02:25.060]  Former Navy.
[03:02:25.060 --> 03:02:29.460]  Yeah, but- We have another former Marine, we have another
[03:02:29.460 --> 03:02:30.460]  former Navy.
[03:02:30.460 --> 03:02:38.220]  You know, I'm not sitting here claiming I'm going to do violent things or anything like
[03:02:38.220 --> 03:02:39.220]  that.
[03:02:39.220 --> 03:02:42.980]  But you're saying- It would definitely be very hard.
[03:02:42.980 --> 03:02:46.580]  Yeah, let's turn his mic on, Joel.
[03:02:46.580 --> 03:02:48.860]  Have you spoken to Adam by phone?
[03:02:48.860 --> 03:02:50.860]  Has he been allowed to call out?
[03:02:50.860 --> 03:02:54.460]  Actually, Adam hasn't been able to make any phone calls.
[03:02:54.460 --> 03:02:56.020]  That's a violation of his rights.
[03:02:56.020 --> 03:02:59.100]  That's a violation of a bunch of rights.
[03:02:59.100 --> 03:03:04.820]  Well, I spoke to his lawyer, and she passed a message and confirmed with him that he hasn't
[03:03:04.820 --> 03:03:06.740]  been able to make a phone call.
[03:03:06.740 --> 03:03:10.620]  Wow, they really are proud of, ooh, this is big.
[03:03:10.620 --> 03:03:11.620]  That's right.
[03:03:11.620 --> 03:03:15.660]  There's a bunch of federal cases and stuff on that, not being able to make phone calls.
[03:03:15.660 --> 03:03:17.380]  This is kind of NDAA light here.
[03:03:17.380 --> 03:03:21.020]  I would advise you guys to not make provocative statements about this.
[03:03:21.020 --> 03:03:25.020]  You're going to beat them and come out of this smelling like a rose if you guys cool
[03:03:25.020 --> 03:03:26.020]  off.
[03:03:26.020 --> 03:03:28.580]  But I would get out of your house for the next few days, if I was you.
[03:03:28.580 --> 03:03:33.300]  And document everything that happens, everything they say, when you try to talk to them.
[03:03:33.300 --> 03:03:36.140]  Film it if you can, when you go in there and say, is he being-
[03:03:36.140 --> 03:03:39.780]  Always on the police, yeah.
[03:03:39.780 --> 03:03:42.860]  So the lawyer says he's not allowed to make phone calls, wow.
[03:03:42.860 --> 03:03:46.660]  Well, I spoke to one of his defense attorneys.
[03:03:46.660 --> 03:03:51.420]  But imagine, you're giving a speech, they grab you, you disappear into a federal prison
[03:03:51.420 --> 03:03:52.420]  now.
[03:03:52.420 --> 03:03:53.420]  Man, the feds are evil.
[03:03:53.420 --> 03:03:55.860]  They really want a war, I'll tell you.
[03:03:55.860 --> 03:04:00.140]  So we made a motion to grant him a phone call to his dad.
[03:04:00.140 --> 03:04:07.820]  And that motion passed, and he will be given at least the phone call to his father, will
[03:04:07.820 --> 03:04:10.580]  be in contact with his dad so that when he makes that call-
[03:04:10.580 --> 03:04:11.700]  Isn't that nice of him?
[03:04:11.700 --> 03:04:14.680]  I want all the feds to know they're ending our way of life right now.
[03:04:14.680 --> 03:04:17.900]  All you idiots that go along with this, feel like you're on the winning team, your whole
[03:04:17.900 --> 03:04:19.740]  future is destroyed by this.
[03:04:19.740 --> 03:04:22.260]  Is just giving up on the Bill of Rights and Constitution, Joel.
[03:04:22.260 --> 03:04:24.740]  Well, guys, we'll have to get you on the nightly news tonight.
[03:04:24.740 --> 03:04:28.260]  I'm doing the interview portion, other folks are doing the news portion.
[03:04:28.260 --> 03:04:33.260]  But we'll get more tonight, seven o'clock central, prisonplanet.tv.
[03:04:33.260 --> 03:04:35.500]  Thank you so much for joining us, and we'll talk to you soon.
[03:04:35.500 --> 03:04:37.620]  All right, have a great night, Adam.
[03:04:37.620 --> 03:04:38.620]  Okay.
[03:04:38.620 --> 03:04:39.620]  Alex.
[03:04:39.620 --> 03:04:40.620]  All right, you bet, guys.
[03:04:40.620 --> 03:04:42.820]  Listen, folks, that's why you need to support Infowars.com.
[03:04:42.820 --> 03:04:45.940]  You need to buy the books, the videos, the water filters, the materials.
[03:04:45.940 --> 03:04:50.140]  We need to be big and strong up against this enemy, because we are totally committed in
[03:04:50.140 --> 03:04:51.140]  this fight.
[03:04:51.140 --> 03:04:53.460]  We're going in all the way against the globalists.
[03:04:53.460 --> 03:04:55.860]  And these are very serious times we're all in.
[03:04:55.860 --> 03:05:25.460]  So pray for liberty, pray for people that are fighting tyranny.
