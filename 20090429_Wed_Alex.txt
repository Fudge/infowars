[00:00.000 --> 00:14.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.160 --> 00:24.400]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones we are hoping and praying for
[00:24.400 --> 00:30.960]  the best but preparing for the worst ladies and gentlemen and I've been saying since Saturday
[00:30.960 --> 00:39.600]  when I did that two-hour emergency update transmission on the designer flu story as it was
[00:39.600 --> 00:49.440]  really starting to become a panic that if deaths began in the United States then we would have an
[00:49.440 --> 00:56.480]  issue because it's the fast spread of this flu it's the long incubation period so you can't
[00:56.480 --> 01:00.000]  detect it and somebody could spread it for a long time you don't know they're sick you don't know
[01:00.000 --> 01:05.120]  they have a temperature that because they don't have a temperature and I've continued to say
[01:05.120 --> 01:12.400]  that if deaths start in the United States that we have to start taking this a lot more serious
[01:12.400 --> 01:18.960]  I've been hoping this was hype I've been hoping that this was gonna not be a big deal because
[01:18.960 --> 01:23.120]  I'm right here in Texas where this stuff first broke out in the United States and
[01:23.840 --> 01:32.640]  Austin Texas where I live is where the first death happened a 23 month old baby die here in
[01:32.640 --> 01:40.560]  Austin Texas where I live and I know a lot of people that are having respiratory problems it is not
[01:40.560 --> 01:47.760]  imaginary it's not psychosomatic they are throwing up they got diarrhea they're they're coughing
[01:48.960 --> 01:53.520]  a lot of people are sick a lot of people that work in my office have sick family members
[01:54.560 --> 02:00.640]  and you know who's I saw him on Sunday Paul Hartman and he'd been in San Antonio visiting
[02:00.640 --> 02:05.040]  family he didn't even really know about all this and he came in saying oh sorry you know I couldn't
[02:05.040 --> 02:09.360]  come in and help you Saturday my wife's sick so these are people that didn't even know about this
[02:09.360 --> 02:13.680]  flu stuff you know back on Saturday it wasn't big news who were going oh yeah my wife and kid are
[02:13.680 --> 02:20.960]  real sick now she's at home getting better she's getting better right Paul I like this little 23
[02:20.960 --> 02:26.480]  month old it's dead here in Austin so I am here broadcasting from where we have the first death
[02:26.480 --> 02:32.240]  in the United States they're saying and whole schools are canceled in Texas in New York and other
[02:32.240 --> 02:38.800]  places hospitals are filled with people a lot of folks are getting put on ventilators respirators
[02:38.800 --> 02:45.200]  in Mexico clearly the government's been covering up the full spread and extent of this so their
[02:45.200 --> 02:49.280]  actions show that they're really concerned about it but then their rhetoric shows oh it's no big
[02:49.280 --> 02:55.600]  deal no problem now let me tell you who we got coming up on this broadcast this is going to be
[02:55.600 --> 03:01.680]  quite an informative transmission Bob Chapman who has friends and family in Mexico and a lot of intel
[03:01.680 --> 03:08.800]  in Mexico will be popping in in 30 minutes he's got some developments there and can you tell you about
[03:09.040 --> 03:14.160]  Larry Pratt's coming on briefly about this treaty that will ban oil reloading in the
[03:14.160 --> 03:18.960]  United States this is not a drill not a joke this is from gun owners of America the second
[03:18.960 --> 03:24.000]  largest second amendment group and I have the treaty he's just popping in for about 10 minutes
[03:24.000 --> 03:31.360]  then Dr Lynn Horowitz who has put out a very powerful report that's up on info wars.com
[03:31.360 --> 03:38.880]  a text report and an audio report right now at info wars.com where he details and lays out who
[03:38.880 --> 03:45.120]  and what he thinks is behind this will be playing that audio coming up in the next segment and then
[03:45.920 --> 03:52.160]  I'm going to play what Ron Paul has to say about all of this from last night to give you both
[03:52.160 --> 03:59.120]  views on this but the reason I respect Horowitz nothing I've ever heard Horowitz say has turned
[03:59.120 --> 04:05.520]  out to be wrong when he talks about the history of bio weapons the Nazis the eugenicists I learned
[04:05.520 --> 04:10.400]  a lot from him now I got to say when he gets into this kind of new age Christianity and all of that
[04:10.400 --> 04:13.920]  I'm not poo pooing and I just can't prove it one way or the other and he's kind of gotten more off
[04:13.920 --> 04:18.000]  into that so we haven't had him on as much as the last few years I was on with Burmese a few weeks
[04:18.000 --> 04:23.120]  ago night of midnight but when he's talking about bio weapons how they work he's a Harvard
[04:23.120 --> 04:28.240]  Harvard grad he has broken so many major stories and always been right it blew me away he was the
[04:28.240 --> 04:38.960]  first guy a weekend of the anthrax attack in 2001 that said it was a Fort Dietrich Maryland
[04:38.960 --> 04:43.680]  weaponized miniaturized version the FBI was so threatened it was in mainstream news they visited
[04:43.680 --> 04:48.160]  him and tried to say he was behind it when he had no connection to Fort Dietrich trying to shut him
[04:48.160 --> 04:54.960]  down years later it came out he was exactly right he's fingering people he's pointing them out he
[04:54.960 --> 05:01.520]  says he knows exactly how this happened and who did it it's powerful stay with us alex jones here

[08:21.120 --> 08:26.240]  all right there are confirmed cases of this strain this designer appears to be a designer
[08:26.240 --> 08:37.760]  lab strain popping up all over asia europe united states mexico and i had a local austin news report
[08:37.760 --> 08:43.200]  that must have been incorrect there you know there's so much craziness going on the death was in
[08:43.200 --> 08:50.640]  houston the death was in houston but there are people in austin and san antonio hospitals but a
[08:50.640 --> 09:00.080]  lot of that we hope is panicking but there has been a death this is out of the houston chronicle
[09:00.080 --> 09:07.680]  cdc says texas swine flu death is first in us child died in a houston hospital after being
[09:07.680 --> 09:13.600]  transported from brownsville the first reported death united states from the swine flu outbreak
[09:13.600 --> 09:20.240]  was out of a 23 month old mexico city boy who fell ill in brownsville we're now learning more
[09:20.240 --> 09:25.360]  just an hour ago this was not out okay just an hour ago when i was printing these stories
[09:25.360 --> 09:30.400]  they were even getting the cities wrong so uh that is good news it's not good news he's dead
[09:30.400 --> 09:35.360]  it's good news because i was saying uh you know clearly when i called paul watson this morning
[09:37.120 --> 09:44.640]  to do a story and others that if this person died and was in the united states or came from a
[09:44.640 --> 09:51.440]  mexican city that wasn't a big metropolis and that wasn't mexico city that this could be a
[09:51.440 --> 09:58.400]  race specific bio weapon i mean if all you've got dying is mexicans in the united states
[09:59.520 --> 10:06.960]  in mexico and in other countries then this thing is race specific but if you can look at
[10:06.960 --> 10:12.240]  mexico city one of the most toxic full of dioxins and poisons we've had medical doctors on with all
[10:12.240 --> 10:18.560]  the studies about how if you're already toxic how that can allow uh flues that normally aren't lethal
[10:18.560 --> 10:23.280]  to kill you because your immune system has been destroyed by the toxic chemicals that's why
[10:23.840 --> 10:31.440]  drug addicts that use dirty methamphetamine that's been produced in you know back room labs
[10:32.320 --> 10:38.240]  that are filled with all sorts of toxins because the drug dealers can't get the original
[10:38.240 --> 10:44.640]  uh chemicals they need to make the pure speed those sub chemical chemicals to make the speed
[10:45.200 --> 10:49.520]  are controlled substance so people have to mix four or five six seven eight different chemicals
[10:49.520 --> 10:55.680]  together just to get uh just to get each sub component and so you might have 10 20 30 40
[10:55.680 --> 11:01.360]  depending on what recipe it is chemicals mixed together and then improperly separated out in
[11:01.360 --> 11:08.240]  things and then they call it speed you're really just taking a bunch of under the you know sink
[11:08.240 --> 11:14.080]  poisons i mean you can spray raid on your tongue get high off of it probably hit yourself in the
[11:14.080 --> 11:19.200]  hammer for five times and get a buzz you know i've had concussions before and felt like i was
[11:19.200 --> 11:23.680]  high as a kite and you can run your head into a brick wall and get high i'm sure as you're dying
[11:23.680 --> 11:29.040]  you know you eat some cyanide they say you're high for 30 seconds reportedly it feels pretty wild
[11:29.040 --> 11:36.800]  uh but uh so that's why all these people end up getting quote hiv like diseases aids like
[11:36.800 --> 11:42.960]  diseases caused by hiv but they test their blood and they have no hiv virus the toxins have just
[11:42.960 --> 11:48.560]  killed all their white blood cells and now a common cold will kill them so that's what's going on at
[11:48.560 --> 11:54.080]  least in the past in mexico city people die of the common flu by the hundreds a day in mexico
[11:54.080 --> 11:59.840]  city the common cold by hundreds a day so they talk about 150 something dead this is nothing this is
[11:59.840 --> 12:06.880]  a hoax and pure hype unless they're covering up the true number of deaths because they're acting
[12:06.880 --> 12:12.880]  like this is the worst thing since the spanish flu of 1918 but if their government's telling the
[12:12.880 --> 12:20.400]  truth it isn't though it is not the flu season it is not the cold season in texas and there's a bunch
[12:20.400 --> 12:25.120]  of people sick and they're reporting a lot of normal flu cases so i don't know what's going on
[12:25.120 --> 12:30.080]  that's why we've got dr linhoro what's coming up in an hour and a half then we've got steve quail
[12:30.080 --> 12:36.640]  joining us for an update uh in the last hour today with all his latest intel and info so
[12:36.640 --> 12:41.440]  the first reported death in the united states from the swine flu outbreak was that of a 23 year old
[12:41.440 --> 12:46.640]  mexico city boy who fell ill in brownsville and was transported for treatment at texas children's
[12:46.640 --> 12:54.080]  hospital in houston where he died monday now folks it's wednesday and they didn't tell us about this
[12:54.720 --> 13:04.080]  until this morning in fact this was posted at 10 46 a.m central standard time in the houston
[13:04.080 --> 13:11.040]  chronicle this went up on drudge 25 30 minutes ago it's up on info wars dot com is one dot com
[13:11.040 --> 13:16.480]  right now so this just came out that's why there was even a wrong story here in the local news
[13:16.480 --> 13:20.560]  in austin saying it was austin so there's a lot of panicking a lot of freaking out going on
[13:20.560 --> 13:27.040]  dr david perrest director of the city's emergency medical services said the acutely old child was
[13:27.040 --> 13:33.440]  admitted to brownsville hospital on april 13th well they just die of that's a long time ago folks
[13:33.440 --> 13:39.600]  that's 15 days ago 16 days ago and immediately was rushed by medical transport to houston
[13:39.600 --> 13:47.120]  so they've known about this in houston for close to two weeks according to the texas
[13:47.120 --> 13:51.760]  department of state health services so see this kind of adds to maybe they know it's already
[13:51.760 --> 13:55.440]  spread maybe they know it has a long incubation as they've admitted seven eight days maybe they
[13:55.440 --> 14:00.000]  know it is deadly we don't know we're going to find out though we're going to find out in the next
[14:00.000 --> 14:06.320]  week or so is that more and more pieces of the puzzle come into play we'll be covering it all
[14:06.320 --> 14:11.040]  here according to the texas department of state health services the boy already had several
[14:11.040 --> 14:15.920]  underlying health problems so there you go they're all ways i'm reading this is i got this rise
[14:15.920 --> 14:21.600]  we went on air we're already in this together so see like i said run down already sick was he a
[14:21.600 --> 14:28.160]  hemophiliac that'll probably come out was he given factor eight from bear did he live in
[14:28.160 --> 14:33.840]  nexco city was he poor in a toxic area according to the texas department of public health services
[14:33.840 --> 14:38.400]  the boy already had several underlying health problems before he flew to matta morris on
[14:38.400 --> 14:43.440]  april fourth and crossing the brownsville to visit relatives the boy came down with a fever
[14:43.440 --> 14:48.080]  april eight followed by another flu-like symptom you know you got to love it whether you're italian
[14:48.080 --> 14:54.000]  german chinese spanish it didn't matter you came to this country to ellis island they tested you for
[14:54.000 --> 14:59.840]  diseases were you sick you had to stay in quarantine not in america now it's wide open but if you're a
[14:59.840 --> 15:05.840]  u.s citizen coming over you're lucky if you don't get a proctology exam you know putting the gloves on
[15:07.280 --> 15:11.680]  because we're the cows we're the slaves we're the milk cows to be fed on and we'd like scum
[15:12.800 --> 15:14.960]  not people with deadly flues or whatever
[15:17.040 --> 15:21.280]  pares learned of the centers of disease control and prevention confirmation of the virus before
[15:21.280 --> 15:25.920]  dawn this morning other people accompanying the child have shown no signs of illness and the boy
[15:25.920 --> 15:31.200]  was not known to be sick when he crossed the border yeah right seeing he was sick and then they
[15:31.200 --> 15:35.920]  brought him across the border came down with a fever april eight followed by other flu-like
[15:35.920 --> 15:42.240]  symptoms and they crossed the border those precautions include it says uh they this doesn't
[15:42.240 --> 15:47.280]  really change the landscape here in houston he said we know it's in the us it's in texas we need
[15:47.280 --> 15:53.680]  to take our own personal precautions that's why the first thing they said sunday at the cdc
[15:53.680 --> 15:57.520]  and homeland security is oh it's already spread everywhere we're not going to control the borders
[15:59.120 --> 16:02.880]  but then they start saying there may be another strain in mexico that's killing everybody
[16:02.880 --> 16:07.840]  a different mutation of this in an earlier strains in the u.s well if they're saying that's a
[16:07.840 --> 16:14.240]  possibility why isn't that border shut because they won't shut it come hell or high water the spp
[16:14.240 --> 16:19.600]  security prosperity partnership north american union plan that we've published and posted their
[16:19.600 --> 16:26.320]  own documents is to use flu and smallpox outbreaks to create a contiguous border from alaska through
[16:26.320 --> 16:31.200]  canada through the united states to mexico with its border with central america by guatemoa
[16:34.080 --> 16:38.720]  they're going to use this crisis to set this up we're already under un control the un secretary
[16:38.720 --> 16:43.040]  general bragged yesterday that we're at level four of the u.s and mexico are following world
[16:43.040 --> 16:49.360]  health organization orders those precautions include hand washing covering coughs or ceases
[16:49.360 --> 16:55.360]  and contacting a physician upon detection of flu likes symptoms such as fever body aches nausea
[16:55.360 --> 17:00.960]  and upset stomach he said mayor bill whites today it should come as no surprise that severely ill
[17:00.960 --> 17:05.360]  people are transported to a city with some of the most outstanding medical facilities in the world
[17:05.360 --> 17:10.320]  that does not mean that houston is somehow an epicenter of the swine flu yeah we were all arguing
[17:10.320 --> 17:15.920]  around the office where we thought it would first have deaths i'm on record i said i thought it would
[17:15.920 --> 17:23.760]  be houston i said i think it'll be houston where it first pops up there still have been no reported
[17:23.760 --> 17:28.480]  houston area cases of the disease which is thought to have begun in mexico but it's being detected
[17:28.480 --> 17:33.120]  around the globe however houston department of health and human services spokesman kathy barton
[17:33.120 --> 17:38.960]  said this will likely change we expect to see confirmations the next few days as those arrest
[17:38.960 --> 17:44.240]  the country yeah it's spread everywhere uh let's go ahead and start with ron paul into the break
[17:44.240 --> 17:49.200]  he said this last night before they've been a confirmed death but i hope he's right and i tend
[17:49.200 --> 17:52.800]  to lean towards what he's saying but we'll get the views of steve quail dumberland horowitz
[17:53.920 --> 17:58.240]  and others today let's go ahead and go to this tape of ron paul last night this is up on info
[17:58.240 --> 18:05.200]  wars dot com looks like our government's getting us pretty upset and concerned about the swine flu
[18:05.200 --> 18:10.640]  this is interesting to me not only for political reason but also as a physician it makes me think
[18:10.640 --> 18:18.800]  back to 1976 the first year i served in the congress we had a vote on the swine flu back then
[18:18.800 --> 18:24.240]  there was a panic and they said it was going to sweep the nation and they rapidly came up with
[18:24.240 --> 18:30.160]  some flu shots and the government was going to inoculate everybody and save the world from this
[18:30.160 --> 18:36.000]  disaster and i remember there were two votes against it myself and larry mcdonald another
[18:36.000 --> 18:41.600]  physician uh it turned out though that our instincts were correct not only did we object
[18:41.600 --> 18:45.040]  to it because we didn't think the government should be in the medical business and making
[18:45.040 --> 18:49.840]  these medical decisions but it turned out that the instincts were absolutely right
[18:49.840 --> 18:56.160]  because uh the flu came and the flu went and one person died except for those individuals
[18:56.160 --> 19:02.480]  who died from getting the flu vaccine and over 25 people died uh just from getting the vaccine
[19:02.480 --> 19:07.760]  and many got ill from it until finally they had to suspend the whole program but here we are once
[19:07.760 --> 19:12.880]  again the swine flu coming up and everybody's panicking and this is not the downplay that
[19:12.880 --> 19:19.120]  seriousness some people have died some people might die yet uh we've had no deaths in this country
[19:19.840 --> 19:26.000]  but there's seven or eight cases up in new york none have even been hospitalized and yet it's
[19:26.000 --> 19:32.240]  practically like uh we've been attacked by nuclear weapons i mean press conference of the weekend
[19:32.240 --> 19:37.600]  prime uh item for the department of homeland security how did the department of homeland
[19:37.600 --> 19:44.160]  security get into the medical business you know it just is totally totally out of out of control
[19:44.160 --> 19:49.440]  on what they think uh we we should do but but you know trying to put this in a perspective
[19:49.440 --> 19:56.000]  i checked to find out how many cases of tuberculosis we had last year we had about 13 000 cases of
[19:56.000 --> 20:03.040]  tuberculosis now that's a serious disease attention gardeners this is an urgent gc and

[25:39.600 --> 25:45.120]  ron paul then i've got the economic news there is no doubt whether this is a serious pandemic
[25:45.120 --> 25:50.160]  or not that they are using it as a political distraction the economic numbers just came in
[25:50.160 --> 25:56.400]  and it's worse and moving quicker than even i had thought so that's the guaranteed devastation
[25:57.040 --> 26:01.120]  that's happening meanwhile obama's meant to radiate confidence and happiness with all the
[26:01.120 --> 26:05.600]  smiling and the giddiness and he starts laughing and giggling and all the interviews and it's all
[26:05.600 --> 26:13.200]  bubbly it's it's acting and the uh interviewer from 60 minutes says are you drunk are you punch
[26:13.200 --> 26:19.040]  drunk it's all an act to make sure you know to make it look like to all the natives the american
[26:19.040 --> 26:25.120]  people everything's calm everything's fine just go about your business obama's up there acting
[26:25.120 --> 26:30.160]  like he's sitting in his easy chair you know and in the sun drinking a corona while everything
[26:30.160 --> 26:35.600]  collapses and burns behind him and they go but look you know the head bird that you never notice
[26:35.600 --> 26:40.000]  how there's one bird and a flock of birds or all the other birds watch and if that bird flies and
[26:40.000 --> 26:44.640]  takes off they all do but if one of the lesser birds does they don't you're i mean that's how
[26:44.640 --> 26:49.360]  humans operate it's how wolves operate it's how a lot of creatures operate we're all watching
[26:49.360 --> 26:55.040]  obama but he says it's fine it must be the bankers love me here's ron paul getting into what he
[26:55.040 --> 27:02.080]  thinks is going on with the uh flu about 13 000 cases of tuberculosis now that's a serious disease
[27:02.080 --> 27:07.360]  and also the last time they recorded the number of deaths in this country was in in 06 and there
[27:07.360 --> 27:13.600]  were 644 deaths from tuberculosis now i hate to even bring that subject up to try to put this in a
[27:13.600 --> 27:21.200]  proper perspective because maybe tomorrow they're going to quarantine everybody in the world and
[27:21.200 --> 27:27.680]  they're coming into this country to watch out for tuberculosis and uh all these things are very
[27:27.680 --> 27:33.200]  serious the big question is does uh a bigger government always solve these problems they
[27:33.200 --> 27:38.960]  usually make things much worse so all i'm asking people to do is step back and think for a minute
[27:38.960 --> 27:45.280]  rather than rushing and panicking and taking taking advantage of opportunities like this this is what
[27:45.280 --> 27:49.520]  happens whether they're economic problems or medical problems uh the people who love big
[27:49.520 --> 27:54.640]  governments take advantage of this and in the department of homeland security she's really
[27:54.640 --> 27:59.920]  not acting outside the prerogatives or the heck that department and one of the reasons i voted
[27:59.920 --> 28:06.160]  against it it's it's an open door invitation to deal with medical problems and of course the way
[28:06.160 --> 28:11.280]  i see medical care in this country is deteriorating and the costs are skyrocketing mainly because we
[28:11.280 --> 28:16.880]  have had central economic planning in medicine now for 30 some years it hasn't worked very well so
[28:16.880 --> 28:23.680]  now we're about to embark on socialized medicine but i i just don't think that uh we need the
[28:23.680 --> 28:29.920]  government uh in this manner dealing with this problem in a hysterical manner we ought to just
[28:29.920 --> 28:35.200]  sit back and think about it for a minute and maybe we'll come to our senses but certainly
[28:35.200 --> 28:41.760]  it isn't a responsibility on the department of homeland security even though technically they
[28:41.760 --> 28:48.720]  might have the authority that to me is not something that should be turned over to to that
[28:48.720 --> 28:54.240]  department that is the medical care of this country all right that's congressman ron paul
[28:54.240 --> 28:59.440]  before there had been a confirmed death uh in houston texas at a medical center of a
[28:59.440 --> 29:08.400]  a mexican national a 20 month 23 month old mexican national who was brought in to texas
[29:09.360 --> 29:14.880]  back on april eighth brought into a hospital in brownsville texas and on the border and then
[29:14.880 --> 29:23.360]  taken to houston and then died there uh confirmed of this new mutagen flu that's uh got pig human
[29:23.360 --> 29:28.640]  and bird in it all the experts medical doctors we've talked to call a designer every piece of
[29:28.640 --> 29:34.800]  evidence shows that it's popped up out of season in the wrong hemisphere it's just all the evidence
[29:34.800 --> 29:39.280]  points towards manufactured but the big news is economic we'll tell you about that briefly
[29:39.280 --> 29:43.760]  when we come back and bob chatman's uh got a lot of intel of what's going on in mexico he's got

[33:31.840 --> 33:38.960]  brownsville uh people in other areas that are flu affected if you have an eyewitness report
[33:38.960 --> 33:45.520]  one eight hundred two five nine ninety two thirty one one eight hundred two five nine

[34:05.280 --> 34:11.920]  this with the director of gunners of america larry pratt then dr lynn horowitz will be joining us
[34:11.920 --> 34:17.680]  with amazing developments and information then steve quayle that is a jam packed transmission
[34:17.680 --> 34:21.680]  now uh next hour we'll have some open phones because again larry pratt's only on with us for
[34:21.680 --> 34:27.680]  about 15 minutes uh and then uh we will uh take calls and and cover all the news as this develops
[34:27.680 --> 34:34.640]  confirmed death in houston but first one i saw this morning it said the death was in austin texas
[34:34.640 --> 34:40.800]  that was in mainstream news then about 30 minutes for airtime that's the time stamp on this the
[34:40.800 --> 34:47.840]  houston chronicles actually time stamped 14 minutes for airtime 10 46 a.m central standard time they
[34:47.840 --> 34:53.760]  said no no it's houston and all the details came out first the cdc and the texas health department
[34:53.760 --> 34:59.200]  had just said there was a death in texas in austin and they wouldn't say it was a boy or girl uh now
[34:59.200 --> 35:08.240]  they have said specifically uh so 23 month old mexican national boy from mexico city now again
[35:08.240 --> 35:14.560]  we're hoping it's not race specific because if it continues to just kill mexicans even in small
[35:14.560 --> 35:21.840]  healthy towns with well-to-do people as is happening and then it doesn't kill any gringos blacks or
[35:21.840 --> 35:29.440]  whites uh here in the united states we got a problem because then you know it's designer race
[35:29.440 --> 35:35.120]  specifics are almost always designer a very effective it's they say that it might have been
[35:35.120 --> 35:44.240]  reading up on it might be able to occur uh in nature you know there's some breeds of wolves
[35:44.240 --> 35:50.080]  some breeds of pigs some breeds of skunk that are more successful you know i mean just varieties
[35:50.080 --> 35:57.200]  you know that is you can read a certain variety of uh say skunk that's in the florida everglades
[35:57.200 --> 36:03.760]  that is more susceptible to you know different diseases than a skunk you could breed it with
[36:03.760 --> 36:10.480]  from upstate new york it's a different variety though kind of like there's what six or seven
[36:10.480 --> 36:15.680]  varieties of wolves in the u.s five or six varieties for some reason it's the same number
[36:15.680 --> 36:18.800]  you know they argue is this really a different variety or is that but six or seven different
[36:18.800 --> 36:24.880]  varieties of mountain lion puma wildcat you know all the different names for it but there's a tiny
[36:24.880 --> 36:32.000]  one in the florida everglades only about 60 pounds versus bigans in in east uh in west texas
[36:32.000 --> 36:37.600]  they're also in east texas but the biggest ones are in uh west texas and south texas big bend
[36:37.600 --> 36:45.680]  you know they get up to 190 pounds 200 pounds 220 pounds that attack people the variety in california
[36:45.680 --> 36:52.480]  i'm already digressing into it's it's it's interesting the issue here is this if this is
[36:52.480 --> 36:57.600]  race specific if it only kills hispanics and that's what it looks like it's doing
[36:58.800 --> 37:03.600]  then we got a problem but you have to look at all the environmental factors one of the dirtiest
[37:03.600 --> 37:09.040]  most toxic cities i mean i've seen documentaries and federal reports and the video of it
[37:09.040 --> 37:16.160]  for some reason the travis county was airing on its cable channel about 12 years ago don't forget
[37:16.160 --> 37:22.480]  seeing it a documentary done by a county worker down there where it showed uh a third of the
[37:22.480 --> 37:26.560]  children born with this disorder with no brain or it's a tiny brain they're just vegetables
[37:26.560 --> 37:33.520]  they're born total vegetables uh because of all the toxic waste unless they all mean the majority
[37:33.520 --> 37:39.600]  of it is dumped in mexico city from north america mexico takes it they're so corrupt they just put
[37:39.600 --> 37:42.800]  it in giant open landfills and the people live in and around the landfills and it seeps into the
[37:42.800 --> 37:47.840]  water table and they get it out of well water city water and they can't afford anything else
[37:47.840 --> 37:52.720]  the documentary showed how an hour or two a day water will come out of the faucet and they all
[37:52.720 --> 37:57.680]  fight with rubbed with uh with jugs to get the water and you test it it's total toxic waste
[37:57.680 --> 38:03.200]  the mothers drink this 30 plus million people in mexico city i digress and bob's holding
[38:05.040 --> 38:10.000]  and it said he had underlying health issues they're not saying what he was from mexico city
[38:10.000 --> 38:16.160]  now if they're deaths in the united states a healthy mexican americans we are in a crisis
[38:18.400 --> 38:23.520]  and i'm just praying and hoping that doesn't happen so we'll break all that down without
[38:23.520 --> 38:27.840]  her horowitz and many others coming up and steve quail right now bob shatman who's got contacts
[38:29.200 --> 38:37.680]  in mexico and uh he can tell us what's going on in mexico bob shatman thank you for coming on
[38:39.040 --> 38:46.160]  you're welcome nice to be here again and uh uh what we've been able to find out is that uh the
[38:46.160 --> 38:55.520]  president of mexico mr called around and those around him uh they decided to implement what
[38:55.520 --> 39:06.000]  amounts to is martial law uh in regard to the disease which has appeared in and around mexico
[39:06.000 --> 39:14.080]  city and uh but not too much in the outlying areas although uh schools are being closed over
[39:14.080 --> 39:23.360]  most of the country and uh people are being told that they shouldn't congregate uh they shouldn't
[39:23.360 --> 39:29.520]  get together in groups yeah for those of them here's the specifics all eateries all restaurants
[39:29.520 --> 39:35.120]  were ordered closed yesterday all schools were ordered closed on monday uh are people following
[39:35.120 --> 39:44.240]  those orders in mexico uh the schools are uh the restaurants are not restaurants are open up open
[39:44.240 --> 39:51.760]  all over the country uh in the soccer games that they had over the weekend uh some cities allowed
[39:52.320 --> 39:58.240]  people to attend that didn't have any experience with the disease uh in big cities uh such as
[39:58.240 --> 40:05.040]  monoray and wadahata uh and mexico city uh the games were played with nobody in the stands
[40:06.800 --> 40:14.240]  and meetings are being called off etc but the the only thing that i understand is open
[40:15.040 --> 40:23.920]  uh our restaurants and uh i'm sure some of them are closed but uh they've mentioned to me that
[40:23.920 --> 40:29.840]  they went out to eat last night so uh and people are running around with masks on
[40:30.720 --> 40:36.560]  and uh you know masks aren't very effective uh unless you happen to cough and spittle
[40:37.280 --> 40:41.360]  comes out of your mouth other than that uh they're not going to keep you from catching anything
[40:43.760 --> 40:48.480]  well the the regular mask i've talked to medical doctors they say it helps a little bit
[40:49.040 --> 40:52.400]  if you're constantly changing them every few hours every time you go out
[40:52.400 --> 40:56.880]  and if you get around people you've got to instantly take the mask off put a new one on
[40:56.880 --> 41:01.520]  because all they're good at is catching the spittle or mucus from a sneeze or a cough
[41:02.160 --> 41:08.480]  in the layer but then as that uh dehydrates then the virus goes ahead and gets pulled on in through
[41:08.480 --> 41:14.640]  by your respiration into your nose or mouth now they do have the nano mask uh and goggles
[41:15.440 --> 41:20.160]  they say that would reduce it by around 90 but most people don't have those you do see the health
[41:20.160 --> 41:25.200]  workers uh in the u.s and others actually wearing those now basically they're glorified uh you know
[41:25.200 --> 41:30.800]  gas mask uh and and and some of them are a hybrid in between a regular mask and and a gas mask
[41:30.800 --> 41:36.000]  or a respirator uh but you're absolutely right i mean if you're not changing these every time
[41:36.000 --> 41:40.400]  you go in another store or around people it's worthless if you have a truckload of them
[41:40.400 --> 41:44.080]  and you're constantly you know wearing them it gives you some protection
[41:44.080 --> 41:53.600]  well i think um you know this uh the discussion in mexico among the people i talked to uh about
[41:53.600 --> 42:02.240]  this uh race specific uh uh aspect but my question is if they have found cases in new zealand and
[42:02.240 --> 42:10.160]  israel and scotland and other places are they with latinos in their those areas well no see it's
[42:10.160 --> 42:16.400]  not killing them and with most race specifics as you know bob it uh it will make all homo sapiens
[42:16.400 --> 42:28.560]  sapiens sick uh it just won't kill them or won't kill them as as as often uh so so well you know
[42:28.560 --> 42:36.160]  as you said earlier i i hope to god this is not race specific but there's no question uh this was
[42:36.160 --> 42:43.360]  made up in a laboratory by the u.s government or someone in contact with them and uh they're doing
[42:43.360 --> 42:48.720]  some experimenting for a whole bunch of reasons well they admit they've made these exact type of
[42:48.720 --> 42:54.080]  splices in thousands of major labs not hundreds there's thousands of these labs that are doing
[42:54.080 --> 43:02.080]  these type of experiments uh ron paul said yesterday that he thinks it's uh hype and when
[43:02.080 --> 43:07.440]  he was first elected to his first term and then he got kicked out and came back to congress i read
[43:07.440 --> 43:16.000]  his uh quotes yesterday uh and uh vectors his quote ron paul warned swine flu scare will be used
[43:16.000 --> 43:21.680]  as precedent for more big government and uh steve washington story and info wars dot net on this
[43:21.680 --> 43:32.480]  uh where he has the quotes uh from ron paul uh where he was saying in 76 this is nothing but
[43:32.480 --> 43:39.040]  fair mongering and is going to be used uh to basically sell people on taking a dangerous
[43:39.040 --> 43:48.000]  vaccine and it was as if he was uh prophetic uh he predicted that uh with great great uh
[43:48.000 --> 43:53.520]  precision the story is up on info wars dot com present wanted dot com uh right now ron paul
[43:54.240 --> 43:59.040]  warns of a swine flu scare and in fact that was published in a book saying this was nothing
[43:59.040 --> 44:06.320]  but the government fair mongering to sell vaccines uh and antiviral drugs uh and ron paul said in a
[44:06.320 --> 44:10.400]  speech we just played earlier that turned out his instincts were correct so was larry mcdonald's
[44:10.400 --> 44:21.440]  uh who also uh predicted that at the time uh ron paul i knew her larry uh he uh described it ron
[44:21.440 --> 44:28.480]  paul did in 76 as a shocking misuse of funds and an evil political maneuver blatant advertising
[44:28.480 --> 44:34.640]  ever to panic the public into taking swine flu shots and he said it will fail and it did fail
[44:34.640 --> 44:38.400]  oh yeah you knew larry mcdonald you've you've been an icon and the he was the head of the john
[44:38.400 --> 44:43.120]  bird society democratic congressman from georgia they clearly killed him on flight 007
[44:43.120 --> 44:46.960]  where his plane suddenly got canceled the end to get on this other one tell folks about that
[44:48.320 --> 44:56.000]  well helen abbey a uh who's a good friend of myself and gary allen in particular in fact i
[44:56.000 --> 45:02.400]  used to go and visit helen when he was living in monaco and he was quite a character um larry
[45:02.400 --> 45:09.840]  mcdonald uh helen abbey abbey but the reason i break him up is he was a foreign policy advisor for
[45:09.840 --> 45:18.160]  larry and um uh he told me the story and uh about what happened which you just briefly explained
[45:18.960 --> 45:25.440]  and um larry was a marked man and there was no question he was coming out with too many things
[45:25.440 --> 45:31.680]  that he had a lot of visibility and he was gaining momentum he was gaining momentum and really leading
[45:31.680 --> 45:37.520]  the charge against the new world order and going on tv and exposing everything now that's correct
[45:37.520 --> 45:47.040]  and he was a very charismatic speaker a very handsome man and uh and very confident and uh i
[45:47.040 --> 45:55.280]  had a long talk with him in of all places san joseco costa rica about a year before he uh
[45:55.280 --> 46:02.960]  got killed and we talked about hill air who he knew uh jointly and uh but anybody who gets close
[46:03.920 --> 46:11.760]  to that sort of thing is marked um somebody sent me a and it's going to be in today's issue which
[46:11.760 --> 46:17.760]  they're preparing right now of the international forecaster and i didn't know about this but uh i
[46:17.760 --> 46:24.800]  know use this mullins quite well in fact i met him the same year i met uh ed griffith and gary allen
[46:24.800 --> 46:36.000]  and in all of those fellows and um i he had wrote a book about uh these uh inoculations or taking
[46:36.000 --> 46:41.600]  shots oh yeah mullins i've interviewed him about that i mean he wrote a book detailing it all
[46:42.560 --> 46:51.440]  that's right and then it was sent to me this morning the page where the medical authorities
[46:51.440 --> 46:59.360]  admitted in the boston globe which still exists during the flu epidemic of 1918
[47:00.880 --> 47:08.960]  that this had been an experiment with inoculations of men in the navy who were in boston
[47:10.080 --> 47:15.680]  who contracted this spanish flu as it was known oh yeah it broke out on the military on the army
[47:15.680 --> 47:19.920]  and naval bases with the returning troops who had been inoculated they were testing a bio weapon on
[47:19.920 --> 47:27.200]  them and so did the 76 these people never stop they never end well it's good for people to read
[47:27.200 --> 47:34.400]  that and i got it in the forecaster and you should pick it up for info wars too yeah as soon as it
[47:34.400 --> 47:40.720]  comes out we'll have it posted proves what evil evil people exact and what really makes me mad
[47:40.720 --> 47:50.160]  about this is my grandfather died in that epidemic oh really and my father barely lived and of course
[47:50.160 --> 47:59.440]  he he lived on to produce me and uh ultimately get parkinson's disease because of his survival
[47:59.440 --> 48:05.440]  and exposure to the spanish flu and that's right for those that don't know it's a fact uh this type
[48:05.440 --> 48:13.600]  of flu uh the type that popped up in 76 in 1918 attacks the brain so even if you survive it uh
[48:13.600 --> 48:20.400]  it it causes major uh degenerative diseases not just in the brain but all major nerve ganglia's
[48:20.400 --> 48:29.200]  like the spine go ahead well so and being the uh the offspring of my father now you can understand
[48:29.200 --> 48:35.760]  why i am the way i am did your dad know about this joke pardon me did your dad know about this
[48:36.960 --> 48:47.520]  i know now he uh he spent uh oh probably uh 25 years uh as a parkinson uh victim and it was on
[48:47.520 --> 48:54.800]  al dopa which you know had him out of his head half the time and uh my mother's loving care kept
[48:54.800 --> 49:02.800]  him alive for years she wouldn't allow him to be put into any kind of an institution and uh it was
[49:02.800 --> 49:10.800]  just a a wonderful act of love but all of this could should have never happened had our government
[49:10.800 --> 49:18.880]  not been doing what they're they were doing in the early 19s and uh you know so what are we saying
[49:18.880 --> 49:26.720]  here uh government has been up to this sort of thing for years and years and years you're right
[49:26.720 --> 49:32.640]  i mean they've been caught over and over and over and over and over and over putting troops in
[49:32.640 --> 49:38.640]  chambers nerve-gassing us troops to death putting out uh homeland security reports saying veterans
[49:38.640 --> 49:42.800]  the number one threat and homeland security is really set up for you we kept telling you that
[49:42.800 --> 49:49.360]  now it's admitted uh and that gun owners are bad these are eugenicists criminals who openly say
[49:49.360 --> 49:54.160]  they want to get rid of you they've been caught with you know all the classic stuff to ski all of
[49:54.160 --> 49:58.080]  it when are we going to wake up you know that's why out of the gates we say this could be the
[49:58.080 --> 50:03.920]  government if they keep grandstanding and hyping and even if it is just a mild flu they're hyping
[50:03.920 --> 50:07.360]  it using it to get control and bob that's what i want to talk to you about in the final segment
[50:07.360 --> 50:15.600]  because the real news here for me is what this is causing as a distraction from horrible economic
[50:15.600 --> 50:23.200]  numbers for those that don't know the last quarter had a 4.9 percent annual uh expected uh drop the
[50:23.200 --> 50:31.680]  last quarter now just came out today 6.3 percent decline in the last quarter because you know this
[50:31.680 --> 50:35.920]  thing's always six months behind so we're now getting it for the last quarter last year i mean
[50:35.920 --> 50:41.040]  this is unbelievable china is basically dumping most its dollars right now to buy hard assets gold
[50:41.040 --> 50:48.400]  copper and us companies uh so they're moving to dump the dollar uh just layoffs are exploding
[50:48.400 --> 50:52.800]  faster than we even thought meanwhile nobody's even talking about that as we go into free fall
[50:52.800 --> 50:56.640]  they're talking about this stupid flu we'll do five minutes with bob Chapman on the economy
[50:56.640 --> 51:01.840]  then larry pratt pops in with draconian gun control news stay with us americans do you

[53:59.360 --> 54:19.040]  okay governor rick perry just minutes ago declared a swine flu state of disaster
[54:19.040 --> 54:24.800]  an emergency in texas so whether this is a real crisis or not they are certainly using it
[54:24.800 --> 54:31.840]  and making it one one death in houston of a mexican national 23 months old boy brought in
[54:32.400 --> 54:40.160]  to brownsville already sick then brought in weeks ago back on back on april 14th he was brought to
[54:40.160 --> 54:46.720]  the hospital guide this morning and they are just way over hyping us they are clearly using this for
[54:46.720 --> 54:51.600]  control the un says they're at level four they may go to level five the world health organization
[54:51.600 --> 54:56.320]  is in control the federal government mexico openly ordering them around through treaties
[54:56.320 --> 55:01.200]  they're they're taking their lead and uh so we're now under the control we need to do an
[55:01.200 --> 55:04.800]  article on that because it's on record you and secretary general announced it yesterday
[55:05.520 --> 55:12.720]  under un control under the spp agreements and the state is just using this and now we're not
[55:12.720 --> 55:17.520]  talking about the economy so more details on this coming up the next segment then lary pratt pops in
[55:17.520 --> 55:21.680]  in closing bob chaplain the international forecaster dot com our sites are info wars dot
[55:21.680 --> 55:25.600]  com prison planet dot com will link up to that latest report you put out as soon as you do
[55:26.400 --> 55:32.480]  bob uh the economic numbers quickly coming in am i right to say this is worse than we were
[55:32.480 --> 55:38.320]  even thinking i mean this is an incredible last quarter decline of 6.3 percent that is a massive
[55:38.320 --> 55:43.920]  plunge is it not well it matches up the fourth quarter of last year and they were looking for
[55:43.920 --> 55:50.880]  five percent and of course they didn't get it that's a minus five and uh i thought that quite
[55:50.880 --> 56:00.000]  frankly uh we might get a uh uh a minus you know uh five and a half percent maybe even five and as
[56:00.000 --> 56:06.720]  we go out into the stimulus package there'll still be deterioration uh but we could inch down to
[56:06.720 --> 56:11.600]  toward the end of the year to perhaps minus four so it's kind of putting paint on a rotten house
[56:11.600 --> 56:15.840]  to interrupt to give the numbers out the u.s. economy contracted a surprisingly sharp 6.1
[56:15.840 --> 56:22.800]  percent rate in the first quarter matching last quarters to be specific 6.3 now now now to put
[56:22.800 --> 56:28.880]  that in context they're saying if russia slows from a six percent growth to a four and a half
[56:28.880 --> 56:33.360]  that means depression if china goes from a 10 percent to below a seven percent they're saying
[56:33.360 --> 56:40.400]  depression we're talking about negative drops here go ahead well the the answer is obvious
[56:40.400 --> 56:48.240]  we are in depression we went into depression around february the first after being in recession

[1:00:32.320 --> 1:00:39.840]  that play that live as that develops and link to it up on info wars dot com news eight awesome
[1:00:39.840 --> 1:00:44.880]  reporting the governor has said that the state has enacted its pandemic flu plan the through the
[1:00:44.880 --> 1:00:50.000]  division of the emergency management perry urge texas to act responsibly and he advised from state
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:54.880]  officials so they put out announcements to scare everybody but then say be calm that way they get
[1:00:54.880 --> 1:00:59.440]  to fear monger but then also play the part of the big daddy figure that's going to take it
[1:00:59.440 --> 1:01:03.600]  care of you rick perry is a globalist he went to bill terberg group and bragged about even though
[1:01:03.600 --> 1:01:11.200]  it violated federal law to set policy internationally uh they're they're saying two different types of
[1:01:11.200 --> 1:01:17.280]  pig flu with human flu and bird flu combined back into another pig and then jump to humans
[1:01:17.280 --> 1:01:21.760]  that's what cnn's claiming can't believe anything these people say it's confirmed 91 cases in the
[1:01:21.760 --> 1:01:28.320]  united states one death in the u.s and houston texas 2,500 cases in mexico that is definitely a lie
[1:01:28.320 --> 1:01:33.040]  and in closing bob Chapman uh finishing up your point that the break uh interrupted
[1:01:33.040 --> 1:01:42.080]  um there's just several hundred cases in mexico not the amount that they're talking about
[1:01:42.080 --> 1:01:49.120]  and most of all of it is confined to mexico city and the environs and so you know again
[1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:57.600]  it is just absolute foolishness and of course the people are going to fall for it they always do
[1:01:57.600 --> 1:02:05.760]  well that's my point is that you get 15 to 35,000 people kept emailing me going it's 36,000 cdc says
[1:02:05.760 --> 1:02:10.640]  but i've read the medical reports and heard from doctors and others that they just exaggerate and
[1:02:10.640 --> 1:02:15.200]  you know people that die of old age they call it flu and that's really about 15,000 fine let's say
[1:02:15.200 --> 1:02:21.120]  that makes my point even better let's say 36,000 people die 36,000 people die a year in this country
[1:02:21.120 --> 1:02:25.840]  of flu of 300 million okay and it's usually dehydration because they you know they're in their
[1:02:25.840 --> 1:02:30.320]  house they live alone generally you know they get sick nobody's there to know they're sick
[1:02:30.320 --> 1:02:35.520]  they can't drink any water for three or four days and they die of dehydration now you got
[1:02:36.960 --> 1:02:42.160]  close to 200 deaths they're saying in mexico now uh you know you got one death in the us that was
[1:02:42.160 --> 1:02:47.600]  from mexico this is out of control fear mongering now we'll get all the other angles here today
[1:02:47.600 --> 1:02:51.920]  and people think it's something worse and it could be but regardless the response to what
[1:02:51.920 --> 1:02:56.720]  the government says they know is going on is overblown in fear mongering now they know something we
[1:02:56.720 --> 1:03:01.360]  don't know maybe in court maybe it's confirmed to be more serious but it's the track record
[1:03:01.360 --> 1:03:07.680]  of the government and releasing deadly pathogens that we have to look at uh bob Chapman reporting
[1:03:07.680 --> 1:03:12.800]  to us so with contacts in mexico thank you so much for popping in with us well thank you i'll see
[1:03:12.800 --> 1:03:18.720]  on friday bye bye take care bob Chapman i want to bring up rob do now uh rob do uh has one of
[1:03:18.720 --> 1:03:24.240]  his bandmates who works in a facility and they uh at seven in the morning uh delivered two truck
[1:03:24.240 --> 1:03:29.440]  loads of camouflage but we're all shush hush about it uh tell folks about that to rob yeah he gets
[1:03:29.440 --> 1:03:34.000]  in uh really early in the morning and uh he was having his coffee and he looks out the the window
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:38.800]  and he sees um the the cops pulling up you know and they're kind of coordinating everything off
[1:03:38.800 --> 1:03:44.880]  and these two trucks come in and uh back in um you know two giant tractor trailer loads of stuff
[1:03:44.880 --> 1:03:50.400]  and he goes that usually doesn't happen here and like that and uh and then he talked to somebody
[1:03:50.400 --> 1:03:55.600]  later that day and they they were told uh our i think it was a memo went out um that said they
[1:03:55.600 --> 1:04:01.280]  were delivering that they had the tamaflu here at the at the facility that he works at and what
[1:04:01.280 --> 1:04:08.480]  facility is that he's a he uh tests um uh water i guess for for the state so it's a health department
[1:04:08.480 --> 1:04:14.720]  yeah state health department or city um it's state yeah so the state health department here in austin
[1:04:14.720 --> 1:04:20.720]  right right and they had two 18 wheelers full of tamaflu tractor trailers yeah which by the way
[1:04:20.720 --> 1:04:26.240]  mutates the virus and accelerates its mutation with the medical doctors on confirming that the
[1:04:26.240 --> 1:04:32.560]  media admits it and that's the state buying the tamaflu from the private company that rumsfeld
[1:04:32.560 --> 1:04:38.000]  bush and obama own stockings so right there they have a reason now they got general james conway
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:43.120]  marine corps commandant uh fear mongering about it that by the way they're they're doing a latin

[1:05:11.840 --> 1:05:16.720]  and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid some say that this summer's demand for electrical
[1:05:16.720 --> 1:05:22.240]  power may finally push the grid over its edge creating a cascade of power outages across the
[1:05:22.240 --> 1:05:28.240]  country putting us all in the dark are you prepared for the next round of storm related outages or
[1:05:28.240 --> 1:05:33.600]  government created blackouts have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate
[1:05:33.600 --> 1:05:39.120]  your own private supply of electrical power if so this will be the most important information you
[1:05:39.120 --> 1:05:44.480]  have ever heard solar powered generators are finally available they have no moving parts to
[1:05:44.480 --> 1:05:50.800]  wear out or break and require absolutely no gas whatsoever remember the government doesn't own

[1:09:18.720 --> 1:09:22.960]  i've been saying this since saturday in the emergency broadcast we did this is being used as
[1:09:22.960 --> 1:09:28.240]  a giant political distraction that the country is now officially according to the economist magazine
[1:09:28.240 --> 1:09:32.160]  and others in depression two quarters now of continual
[1:09:35.280 --> 1:09:42.000]  6.1 to 6.3 drop in the economy chinese beginning to dump the dollar jobs being lost everywhere
[1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:47.120]  and all anybody's talking about is barack obama and how he's saving us and how great he is and oh
[1:09:47.120 --> 1:09:51.600]  look they released a bunch of white house photos of our great dear leader i was getting coffee in the
[1:09:51.600 --> 1:09:55.680]  break room with the tv on and had to take a double take as they were calling him just an amazing
[1:09:55.680 --> 1:10:00.240]  leader and a great leader and a great man and just how he's all inspiring and it was the anchor on
[1:10:00.240 --> 1:10:06.640]  seeing and doing this i thought i'd woken up in north korea you know the dear leader and now
[1:10:06.640 --> 1:10:11.040]  we're not talking about how he's protecting bush on the torture memos and saying no investigation
[1:10:11.040 --> 1:10:18.320]  now we're not talking about all of his gun control we cannot be distracted from their agenda while we
[1:10:18.320 --> 1:10:23.680]  are busy looking at this they're trying to get through their g20 handing over further us authority
[1:10:23.680 --> 1:10:28.160]  and trillions of dollars to farm offshore banks as they set up the quote bank of the world
[1:10:29.120 --> 1:10:34.080]  they will pay our carbon taxes too they're trying to pass the carbon tax bills that literally shut
[1:10:34.080 --> 1:10:40.400]  down our industry tax and regulate every facet of our lives it's all happening while this flew
[1:10:40.400 --> 1:10:45.360]  with one death of a mexican national that came in here for mexico city where they're all run down
[1:10:45.360 --> 1:10:52.080]  and sick because it's so toxic that's why we got larry pratt here joining us headline from gun owners
[1:10:52.080 --> 1:10:59.200]  dot org the second largest and the only real national pro second amendment group who have
[1:10:59.200 --> 1:11:04.160]  documented that the nra is actually a pro gun control judo scope group controlling the good
[1:11:04.720 --> 1:11:10.400]  members of their organization obama pushing treaty to ban reloading even bb guns could
[1:11:10.400 --> 1:11:17.440]  be on the chopping block now remember the unidear july 7th 2001 meeting in new york where they said
[1:11:17.440 --> 1:11:23.040]  we want to ban all civilian ownership of firearms worldwide because it threatens the legitimate
[1:11:23.040 --> 1:11:28.480]  power monopoly of the state now under this treaty and these are binding that's what all the naftan
[1:11:28.480 --> 1:11:34.000]  got and all of that is we're under unesco we're under you in control right now with this flu
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:39.360]  situation it allows and says it's basically explosives manufacturing to have your own
[1:11:39.360 --> 1:11:43.840]  reloading or even have companies reloading and you see the government now trying to block
[1:11:43.840 --> 1:11:49.760]  the army from selling the spent brass all this is happening larry pratt joining us
[1:11:49.760 --> 1:11:55.360]  from virginia right outside dc the director of governors of america thank you for joining us
[1:11:55.360 --> 1:12:01.120]  hi alex good to be with you we can't allow ourselves to be distracted by this flu while
[1:12:01.120 --> 1:12:06.640]  they move with the carbon taxes the the attacks on the second amendment you name it tell us what's
[1:12:06.640 --> 1:12:14.720]  happening sir well during the president's world apology tour apologizing for all the terrible
[1:12:14.720 --> 1:12:22.080]  things united states has done he stopped off in mexico and apologized for the united states
[1:12:22.080 --> 1:12:29.680]  causing mexico's crime problem and this is a kind of a favorite of the liberals they
[1:12:29.680 --> 1:12:35.600]  and the anti gunners they like to do this sort of thing they've done it for years blaming virginia
[1:12:35.600 --> 1:12:43.440]  for dc's crime problem and nobody asked the president or nobody asked the mexican president
[1:12:43.440 --> 1:12:51.440]  calderón well if guns are the problem how come texas has so much a lower crime rate than even
[1:12:51.440 --> 1:12:56.320]  right across the river from el paso where they hardly have any problem in juarez they had a
[1:12:56.320 --> 1:13:03.280]  terrible murder problem it's a truly an epidemic that makes the swine flu look like a walk in a park
[1:13:03.280 --> 1:13:10.400]  which may be you know comparatively what it really is so he said in order to solve this terrible
[1:13:10.400 --> 1:13:19.760]  problem i'm going to make sure that the senate acts quickly on the inter-american gun control
[1:13:19.760 --> 1:13:27.680]  treaty it's called sifta in its hispanic or hispanic language acronym and the sifta treaty has
[1:13:27.680 --> 1:13:33.440]  been kicking around for quite a while and as you said it would require licenses for reloading
[1:13:33.440 --> 1:13:39.680]  ammunition if you wanted to change the barrel on your gun you'd be a manufacturer hence you'd need
[1:13:39.680 --> 1:13:49.680]  to be licensed gun bans would be a fairly easy thing and it could be done without a once the
[1:13:49.680 --> 1:13:56.640]  treaty is ratified it all these things could be done and more without any kind of vote of congress
[1:13:56.640 --> 1:14:03.840]  because the treaty would be viewed as law of the land therefore kind of like paul begalla said under
[1:14:03.840 --> 1:14:10.160]  the clinton administration regarding executive orders stroke of the pen law of the land kind of
[1:14:10.160 --> 1:14:17.360]  cool well i think we got some strokes of the pen coming if his treaty ever does end up being ratified
[1:14:17.360 --> 1:14:25.520]  by the united states senate i think we can stop it they need uh to get at least uh 65 votes depends
[1:14:25.520 --> 1:14:31.360]  on how many senators are actually there because there's a couple of uh vacant seats at them well
[1:14:31.360 --> 1:14:38.800]  one empty one vacant um depends on among other things will governor minnesota polenti hold tight
[1:14:38.800 --> 1:14:47.840]  and refuse to can to affirm the election which i think has been stolen so far by acorn on behalf
[1:14:47.840 --> 1:14:54.720]  of al franken and will they just leave the seat open till all the court appeals have been run well
[1:14:54.720 --> 1:14:59.680]  that was my next point is that we now have specter announcing he is going to become a democrat that's
[1:14:59.680 --> 1:15:04.800]  going to give them a filibuster proof in the senate they've got the house and they can just
[1:15:04.800 --> 1:15:13.200]  ram through carbon taxes amnesty plans gun bans and as you know analyzing this draconian treaty
[1:15:13.200 --> 1:15:19.040]  this is bigger and batter than what he's been asking for an hr 45 what they've been pushing in
[1:15:19.040 --> 1:15:26.400]  the new expanded assault weapons ban uh and and so all the lies all their disinfo about stand down
[1:15:26.400 --> 1:15:31.760]  gi like tokyo rose in world war two saying we're not firing on you as they were firing uh you know
[1:15:31.760 --> 1:15:37.840]  all these lies about we don't want your guns this is the absolute proof his gun banning who
[1:15:37.840 --> 1:15:42.240]  wants a total gun ban for citizens support of the dc gun ban his gun banning attorney general in
[1:15:42.240 --> 1:15:47.520]  mexico in texas in california constant speeches saying we've got to do something about this uh
[1:15:47.520 --> 1:15:52.800]  uh you know blaming the mexican drug cartels and the victim disarmament culture down there
[1:15:52.800 --> 1:15:57.040]  and their culture of corruption uh blaming the united states for this is asinine they always
[1:15:57.040 --> 1:16:01.840]  blame indiana for chicago where they have a gun ban they always blame upstate new york and new
[1:16:01.840 --> 1:16:07.680]  jersey for uh new york city you're absolutely right and so now there's no debating they are
[1:16:07.680 --> 1:16:13.760]  openly coming at the throat of all gun owners with with something bigger than the 68 gun control
[1:16:13.760 --> 1:16:20.400]  act bigger than the uh i mean everything rolled together all previous gun control rolled together
[1:16:20.400 --> 1:16:25.600]  here it is manifesting and they just keep saying this is not an assault this is not an assault
[1:16:25.600 --> 1:16:32.000]  with that military tactic of of lying and denying that you're assaulting while you're assaulting
[1:16:32.000 --> 1:16:39.440]  just like tanks when they charge an emplacement put out smoke to obscure themselves from artillery
[1:16:39.440 --> 1:16:44.320]  and mortars that is all they're doing well we got radar folks we're cutting right through the smoke
[1:16:44.320 --> 1:16:49.600]  these bastards are coming at the heart of the bill of rights right now the good news is that
[1:16:49.600 --> 1:16:56.400]  because it's a treaty they would need a two-thirds vote which ups the ante and i think we can hold
[1:16:56.400 --> 1:17:03.360]  them but the only way we're going to uh keep them from voting for the treaty is for the senate to
[1:17:03.360 --> 1:17:08.960]  realize that uh we're watching them we've gotten a couple of good votes so far in the senate and
[1:17:08.960 --> 1:17:16.080]  we've talked about those uh the uh dc gun ban was uh stuck pretty hard by an amendment to a measure
[1:17:16.080 --> 1:17:25.200]  in the senate and a uh an amtrak gun shipping prohibition was dumped um again by something
[1:17:25.200 --> 1:17:31.600]  like 63 votes in the senate well we've got uh almost 20 votes more than we need assuming
[1:17:31.600 --> 1:17:37.600]  it is an up or down vote which is the only way they're going to get a treaty through and larry
[1:17:37.600 --> 1:17:42.240]  and larry assuming mexico does it totally collapse with his flu hysteria emergency
[1:17:42.240 --> 1:17:46.480]  being declared in texas they can just say hey we're in an emergency congress you've got to do
[1:17:46.480 --> 1:17:53.360]  this same way they pass the patriot act same way they pass all this stuff the um the never let a
[1:17:53.360 --> 1:17:58.800]  good crisis go to waste is the seems like the watchword of this administration and so you're
[1:17:58.800 --> 1:18:05.120]  quite right they will try to do anything they can to consolidate power i have to admit i was
[1:18:05.120 --> 1:18:12.800]  mistaken i i did not think that obama socialist that i'm convinced he is a marxist to the core
[1:18:13.360 --> 1:18:20.240]  from his education how could he be anything but uh i did not think he would take the gun issue in his
[1:18:20.240 --> 1:18:27.840]  teeth and move as quickly and openly as he has been because he runs a high risk of losing in
[1:18:27.840 --> 1:18:32.880]  the next congressional election his party's control of the congress larry they're going for
[1:18:32.880 --> 1:18:38.800]  the oak they're going for broke and maybe maybe they're kind of uh expecting that they're going
[1:18:38.800 --> 1:18:44.880]  to have an amnesty measure pass soon so they can get lots of heretofore illegal aliens
[1:18:45.520 --> 1:18:50.960]  legalized and registered to vote absolutely no you're right that's what's happening larry
[1:18:51.600 --> 1:18:58.960]  that's probably why they're willing to be so brazen and take this on and in your face
[1:18:58.960 --> 1:19:05.440]  because otherwise i can't see what they're thinking they they've already produced a pushback
[1:19:05.440 --> 1:19:11.920]  there's no doubt about that you can see it in gun store gun show sales it's as if the manufacturers
[1:19:11.920 --> 1:19:19.520]  were making their product with boxes with wings on them as soon as they hit the shelf deploying
[1:19:19.520 --> 1:19:26.160]  and they're off in the air again so the the american people uh are are catching on and
[1:19:26.160 --> 1:19:32.960]  then the market is responding it's reacting it's registering just how much we've caught on

[1:26:31.760 --> 1:26:36.800]  the nr a was actually bad mounting us in the dallas morning news calling us extremist for being

[1:26:55.120 --> 1:27:00.480]  of uh... the secretary of homeland security to uh... find that
[1:27:00.480 --> 1:27:03.680]  g uh... the only terrorist that i can figure out
[1:27:04.480 --> 1:27:11.120]  are anybody that uh... that whole complex of issues pro-life pro-gun pro-limited government
[1:27:11.120 --> 1:27:16.160]  veteran blah blah blah those are all the people that had a tendency to vote against my boss
[1:27:16.160 --> 1:27:22.400]  uh... yeah those are terrible now these exploding muslims on jahad that's the story about that
[1:27:22.400 --> 1:27:27.040]  that's not a real terrorist problem but i we figured it out these guys are really amazing
[1:27:27.600 --> 1:27:34.160]  they uh... you know they know they're in a war and it's our side we've been kidding ourselves
[1:27:34.160 --> 1:27:39.360]  thinking we can make nice we can make concessions we can give things away we can go and do other
[1:27:39.360 --> 1:27:46.880]  things and instead of paying attention to politics and the other side doesn't play that way they
[1:27:46.880 --> 1:27:52.560]  want it all and if they can get it without shooting they'll do it that's what politics all about for
[1:27:52.560 --> 1:27:57.520]  them well erie 99 percent of the time as you know in history you have a fascist or a communist
[1:27:57.520 --> 1:28:02.400]  ruling you uh... this is the nature of power and we know the people running washington
[1:28:02.400 --> 1:28:07.200]  these international bankers and their commie workers we know they want to take over everything
[1:28:07.200 --> 1:28:12.080]  they want to micromanage our lives what else is going on on the gun grabber front and closing

[1:28:25.840 --> 1:28:32.320]  three weeks ago maybe maybe not even that long and they were slobbering over the feet of the
[1:28:32.320 --> 1:28:38.000]  castro brothers and what wonderful people they are and bobby rush was saying how you would
[1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:44.080]  just be honored to have a gun bans death camps everything and castro brothers use the the
[1:28:44.080 --> 1:28:51.360]  previous government's gun registration list the first full day in power sent their thugs out and
[1:28:51.360 --> 1:28:58.080]  they came back with one of two things the registered gun or the missing guns owner and they then
[1:28:58.080 --> 1:29:04.800]  proceeded to kill tens of murder i should say precisely tens of thousands of people in order
[1:29:04.800 --> 1:29:09.280]  to consolidate their power got the cuba admits they killed a hundred and forty something thousand
[1:29:09.280 --> 1:29:16.080]  the first year well that's the bobby rush gun bill it's the dictatorship facilitation bill
[1:29:16.080 --> 1:29:23.120]  registration has never solved a crime in hawaii or canada where handguns they know that they want
[1:29:23.120 --> 1:29:27.600]  their slaves disarmed and they come to the guns it's going to get nasty like we say in texas come

[1:34:52.320 --> 1:34:58.560]  of this you know whether they manufactured it or not they are certainly hyping it you can use that
[1:34:58.560 --> 1:35:07.120]  to wake people up about the endgame for global enslavement what their larger eugenics program is
[1:35:07.120 --> 1:35:17.920]  this that is the key here yes he's got it up is swine flu a race specific virus very important

[1:39:39.040 --> 1:39:44.800]  to bring ted anerson up as he hasn't been up this week to talk about this a peso tumble swine flu
[1:39:44.800 --> 1:39:50.960]  may prompt mexico to tap imf bloomberg mexico is more likely to draw on the 47 billion credit
[1:39:50.960 --> 1:39:54.240]  line for the national monetary fund after the deadly swine flu outbreak sparked the page
[1:39:54.240 --> 1:40:01.360]  those biggest tumble in six months according to barclays capital and those are s dr's imaginary
[1:40:01.360 --> 1:40:08.240]  fiat money the imf and world bank are issuing and the imf is been chosen not the world bank
[1:40:08.240 --> 1:40:12.640]  to be the new bank of the world that and then it's backed up with your carbon taxes to these
[1:40:12.640 --> 1:40:17.920]  bastards so they get the interest in the power you pay for it the peso shake five point one
[1:40:17.920 --> 1:40:23.120]  percent yesterday biggest decline among all currencies the dollars dropping gold and silver
[1:40:23.120 --> 1:40:30.480]  are exploding but cop coppers just off the chart imf again approves 47 million dollar credit line
[1:40:30.480 --> 1:40:35.360]  for mexico that's already happened governor perry declares swine flu state of disaster in texas
[1:40:35.360 --> 1:40:38.960]  as they prepare for quarantines and forced inoculations that's what happens when they go
[1:40:38.960 --> 1:40:43.360]  to level five and that's the quietly being done right now that he's a gentleman want to bring
[1:40:43.360 --> 1:40:49.920]  ted anerson up ted uh i've got the reports here in my stack china is now dumping dollars in mass
[1:40:49.920 --> 1:40:59.520]  uh snatching up gold silver copper uh palladium platinum the timber stocks road stocks mining
[1:40:59.520 --> 1:41:06.480]  stocks media stocks military stocks u.s companies they are just dumping dumping dumping dumping
[1:41:07.120 --> 1:41:15.440]  uh and this is just insane ted you're right about that alex china is the key player in in the uh
[1:41:15.440 --> 1:41:22.320]  economic picture for the united states because china has been the largest financer of u.s government
[1:41:22.320 --> 1:41:28.640]  security sales for about the last 10 years and china holds on to i can't even i don't you know
[1:41:28.640 --> 1:41:33.760]  it's like 3.3 trillion dollars with the u.s government securities if they decided to dump
[1:41:33.760 --> 1:41:39.440]  that portfolio all at once the united states dollar would be worth less than the mexican peso
[1:41:39.440 --> 1:41:44.400]  and uh you're watching the mexican peso go down right now i mean it it has a lot to do with
[1:41:44.400 --> 1:41:50.560]  you know people not traveling to that company that country uh you know a lot of trust we the european
[1:41:50.560 --> 1:41:55.440]  continent right now is is looking at quarantining the united states i mean that's the that's the
[1:41:55.440 --> 1:42:00.320]  type of things that are going on of course that is this has huge economic consequences and like
[1:42:00.320 --> 1:42:05.600]  you said the united states dollar is tumbling right now and gold is going up and so is silver
[1:42:05.600 --> 1:42:10.720]  and of course that industrial metal copper uh is going up as well so yeah indeed indeed
[1:42:10.720 --> 1:42:16.480]  uh right now this uh particular time uh is is another one of those trigger points that people
[1:42:16.480 --> 1:42:21.920]  should be looking seriously at gold and silver and they should be looking seriously at their
[1:42:21.920 --> 1:42:28.240]  stock investments their bond investments their annuities their their ira is their 401k plans
[1:42:28.240 --> 1:42:34.240]  everything that has anything to do with paper currency i mean this this whole euphoric uh
[1:42:34.240 --> 1:42:38.880]  movement that happened on the stock market here recently can be wiped out so quickly we all know
[1:42:38.880 --> 1:42:42.720]  that that's what i was about to say is that and people can go back to this three months ago
[1:42:43.520 --> 1:42:47.040]  two and a half months ago when the market was down to six thousand something people said what
[1:42:47.040 --> 1:42:50.880]  do i do and i said well i'm not going to give you advice but what i would do my own stock which i don't
[1:42:51.760 --> 1:42:57.040]  is i would wait till it runs back up because bob Chapman and dr paul craig roberts everybody
[1:42:57.040 --> 1:43:01.200]  else i trust we've been accurate in the past that's the key you know proofs in the puddin as they say
[1:43:01.920 --> 1:43:07.360]  they have been saying it's going to probably run up to eight or nine thousand again and that that's
[1:43:07.360 --> 1:43:13.360]  the time to get out uh and then it may go down again and then back up again but the point is
[1:43:13.360 --> 1:43:18.160]  i would say now is the time personally to at least partially uh get out of the market
[1:43:18.720 --> 1:43:24.000]  before it goes back down again because folks they're already telling americans not to come to europe
[1:43:24.000 --> 1:43:27.920]  they're already banning a lot of the food exports that we export one of the few things we still have
[1:43:28.720 --> 1:43:33.760]  this is already causing a lot of people to cancel trips to the united states and if this continues
[1:43:33.760 --> 1:43:38.960]  the government continues to hype this up and it just hit me ted it just hit me remember how when
[1:43:38.960 --> 1:43:43.440]  they wanted the banker takeover act known as the bailout act october 3rd to pass and congress
[1:43:43.440 --> 1:43:48.240]  wouldn't pass it they threatened them with physical martial law senator inhofe uh and others on record
[1:43:48.240 --> 1:43:53.040]  and we had some congressmen here on the show to confirm it and they spoke on c span and the floor
[1:43:53.760 --> 1:43:57.600]  that it was it was psychological terrorism fear mongering saying we're gonna have a depression
[1:43:57.600 --> 1:44:03.200]  if you don't do this and then it made the market in the next four months uh go down uh what from
[1:44:03.200 --> 1:44:08.400]  ten thousand to six thousand it's almost almost four thousand full points that was psychological
[1:44:08.400 --> 1:44:14.080]  terrorism and the way the media is hyping this and and making it such a big deal when if they're
[1:44:14.080 --> 1:44:18.400]  separately telling the truth that it isn't that deadly of a flu then when they ignore other
[1:44:18.400 --> 1:44:24.560]  flues that kill tens of thousands then they are purposely trying to kill the market so come out
[1:44:24.560 --> 1:44:29.280]  and say the scary stuff but then say uh you know it's like saying hey honey you're really ugly but
[1:44:29.280 --> 1:44:34.720]  oh i i'm just joking i think you're beautiful you know to your wife the the the damage is done
[1:44:34.720 --> 1:44:39.840]  and they go but we'll save you will protect you it looks like they're trying to bottom out the
[1:44:39.840 --> 1:44:45.680]  markets right as they've agreed and are having the meetings to officially set up the world government
[1:44:45.680 --> 1:44:51.200]  ted well i can tell you alex have been trading in the gold and silver market for 30 years and i
[1:44:51.200 --> 1:44:56.160]  also during that period of time had a series seven license and i handled securities as well
[1:44:56.160 --> 1:45:03.600]  including the stocks bonds cds annuities we i handled all that stuff and uh and i can tell
[1:45:03.600 --> 1:45:08.880]  you right now there's there's a resistance level somewhere at 8200 right around on that level at
[1:45:08.880 --> 1:45:14.160]  the on the dow jones industrial average and gold comes down to that 880 level and it bounces right
[1:45:14.160 --> 1:45:20.560]  back up again always you know just i shouldn't say always but almost a hundred percent of the time
[1:45:20.560 --> 1:45:26.240]  the dow jones industrial average is falling in in the fall of the year and up during the summer
[1:45:26.240 --> 1:45:31.680]  and gold and silver is falling during the summertime it's having its lowest point and then
[1:45:31.680 --> 1:45:37.280]  comes racing right back up by the time october comes we have our october surprises like the crash
[1:45:37.280 --> 1:45:44.160]  in 1997 and certainly a lot of things that happen here uh the the market right now is telling us
[1:45:44.160 --> 1:45:50.480]  that you know that that things are very unstable because golden silvers up now in the spring coming
[1:45:50.480 --> 1:45:56.240]  into the summer the stock market is teetering right at this 8100 dollar dow and then you know
[1:45:56.240 --> 1:46:00.880]  in here you have china talking about dumping the u.s. government securities and getting away
[1:46:00.880 --> 1:46:04.960]  from the paper currency all together the u.s. dollars now is the time to move into golden
[1:46:04.960 --> 1:46:09.520]  silver that's what i personally believe in my heart you know if i had more capital that's
[1:46:09.520 --> 1:46:13.520]  what i'd be doing right now that's what i've been doing ladies and gentlemen get into golden
[1:46:13.520 --> 1:46:20.240]  silver now dead i want to go to calls but first give folks the contact info to stop the procrastination
[1:46:20.240 --> 1:46:31.840]  and get into physical holdings of golden silver well 1800 686 2237 again it's 1800 686 2237 and
[1:46:31.840 --> 1:46:37.840]  once again alex i've been buying a lot of gold here at that 880 level and i have things priced
[1:46:37.840 --> 1:46:43.040]  according to that point in the marketplace and gold is over 900 dollars an ounce so now is the
[1:46:43.040 --> 1:46:48.000]  time to be getting involved i mean the franks right now are 214 they should be trading in the
[1:46:48.000 --> 1:46:54.480]  221 level right now i still have a good supply of those lakota silver rounds which are people are

[1:55:27.520 --> 1:55:32.720]  law makes a just man a criminal and that doesn't mean that you have to obey these laws when they

[1:55:55.440 --> 1:56:00.720]  and implement one-child policies to follow the carbon footprint the water footprints i mean this

[1:56:38.880 --> 1:56:42.480]  st charles missouri two weeks ago we had a roadblock mandatory roadblock
[1:56:43.040 --> 1:56:47.440]  i saw that in the news i saw that the ui checkpoint but they were drawing blood for people that
[1:56:47.440 --> 1:56:51.440]  didn't see that they uh if you refuse to breathalyzer they had court orders to draw your blood now
[1:56:51.440 --> 1:56:57.600]  last night at a uh channel nine the pbs jim leer news hour that was filmed in st louis last night
[1:56:57.600 --> 1:57:01.760]  our mayor patty orc was on the panel i approached her after the filming and i asked her about this
[1:57:01.760 --> 1:57:05.600]  i said why would the city allow this to happen and she looked at me and said this is not a city
[1:57:05.600 --> 1:57:09.840]  program this is a federal program yeah let me stop you in austin it's a federal program
[1:57:09.840 --> 1:57:15.360]  in missouri i didn't see the newspapers hands a city star and others uh these are not real warrants
[1:57:15.360 --> 1:57:20.560]  the the judge signs a blank court order to take blood at the side of the road they have the cops
[1:57:20.560 --> 1:57:26.800]  do it it's totally illegal and now the feds are announcing oh we want dna taken from everybody
[1:57:26.800 --> 1:57:32.640]  stopped at checkpoints with the tissue swab out of the cheek so think of how imagine if if if
[1:57:32.640 --> 1:57:37.360]  when we were kids they taught us in nazi germany they took blood at checkpoints you'd go those
[1:57:37.360 --> 1:57:43.120]  nazis are in 1984 they only videotape you and check your papers you imagine they were taking blood
[1:57:43.120 --> 1:57:51.600]  from winston smith in 1984 this is beyond 1984 they just do it the government is rogue the
[1:57:51.600 --> 1:57:56.240]  government is criminal and so you talk to your local rep and they said hey this is federal
[1:57:56.240 --> 1:58:00.400]  yeah she said this was a federal program and i said is this dhs she said yes it is homeland
[1:58:00.400 --> 1:58:06.560]  security and then we also have FEMA facilities within the area we have welden springs uh and
[1:58:06.560 --> 1:58:09.840]  i was curious why the federal program will be doing this here and then i realized we're the
[1:58:09.840 --> 1:58:14.800]  home place of bowing raytheon and monsanto they're doing it everywhere as a federal grant
[1:58:14.800 --> 1:58:18.480]  to train you to go through checkpoints and have your blood taken i appreciate your call no i mean

[2:00:53.520 --> 2:01:06.720]  going to be very clear about something about dr horowitz i remember in october of 2001
[2:01:07.280 --> 2:01:14.560]  seeing articles he put out at tetrahedron.org and other news sites that he has he's an author
[2:01:14.560 --> 2:01:21.200]  harvett a medical graduate bestselling author researcher filmmaker radio talk show host at
[2:01:21.200 --> 2:01:26.080]  that time on genesis this network came on before me the hours before me in the morning
[2:01:26.720 --> 2:01:32.400]  very popular show just got too busy with his practice to uh to continue it and i remember
[2:01:33.520 --> 2:01:37.280]  as people watch us live at prisonplanet.tv and then around the world and the web later
[2:01:37.280 --> 2:01:42.320]  when this gets posted the four wins in fact we should probably pull that article up maybe he
[2:01:42.320 --> 2:01:47.840]  remind me of the of the title of it or you just google dr lin horowitz anthrax and then you'll
[2:01:47.840 --> 2:01:53.600]  find his original article from 2001 it laying out that it was weaponized had to be fort detrick
[2:01:53.600 --> 2:01:58.560]  maryland that had been coated in bentonite that had little wings on it that they add with nanotech
[2:01:58.560 --> 2:02:02.960]  that cost hundreds of millions of dollars of equipment and that it was uh you know totally
[2:02:02.960 --> 2:02:07.680]  weaponized and that these people were patsies that they were claiming had done it and that it
[2:02:07.680 --> 2:02:12.240]  was the government and then it came out months and months later like a year later that the whole
[2:02:12.240 --> 2:02:16.880]  white house was on cipro the anthrax fighting antibiotic there it is the cia's role in the
[2:02:16.880 --> 2:02:22.400]  anthrax mailings could our spies be agents for military industrial sabotage terrorism
[2:02:22.400 --> 2:02:26.960]  and even population control special report expressly prepared for simultaneous publication
[2:02:27.760 --> 2:02:32.240]  in the spectrum of media bypass that may be that's one of the early articles he did
[2:02:32.240 --> 2:02:41.120]  it yeah october first 2001 absolutely incredible i mean within days of within hours in fact i mean
[2:02:41.120 --> 2:02:45.920]  i was saying i go i like horowitz but how does he you know come out and say all this because
[2:02:45.920 --> 2:02:50.960]  this is all he studies okay it's kind of like i'm an expert on police state martial law and
[2:02:50.960 --> 2:02:56.240]  covert operations domestically because i've been studying that that's how i woke up to their covert
[2:02:56.240 --> 2:03:00.240]  ops that are going on around underneath the surface of life you know here a daily life in
[2:03:00.240 --> 2:03:07.520]  the government drug dealing and the rest of it so he laid it all out and the fbi came to his house
[2:03:07.520 --> 2:03:12.560]  and threatened him and that was in the news saying he was maybe a suspect had nothing to do with
[2:03:12.560 --> 2:03:17.120]  fort detrick nothing to do with government bio weapons he was so close to them that they came
[2:03:17.120 --> 2:03:24.320]  after him and then months after he did all this it came out that he was right the whole white
[2:03:24.320 --> 2:03:28.800]  house was on cipro ap admitted it white house secretary admitted it they started got on
[2:03:28.800 --> 2:03:33.200]  at september 10th three and a half weeks before it showed up bush's enemies were mailed it it was
[2:03:33.200 --> 2:03:38.800]  weaponized it was miniaturized it was the aim strain fort detrick maryland and now they've
[2:03:38.800 --> 2:03:43.200]  tried to burn three patsies and then killed another one so we're gonna first get him to recap
[2:03:44.000 --> 2:03:48.080]  we come back from this break we're going to break right now about erlyn horowitz it's important
[2:03:48.080 --> 2:03:54.240]  introduction that he's been very accurate on this in the past and i made my own film about eugenics
[2:03:54.240 --> 2:03:59.520]  in game blueprint for global enslavement and i done a lot of research on eugenics and i learned a
[2:03:59.520 --> 2:04:04.640]  lot from dr horowitz but as i did my research for a year and a half making that film i found out how
[2:04:04.640 --> 2:04:08.240]  much of what he said was completely accurate because i hear this guy ten years ago laying on
[2:04:08.240 --> 2:04:13.520]  the side and i said maybe that's his interpretation it's not that bad no it is that bad and worse
[2:04:13.520 --> 2:04:19.040]  and so that's why we've got him here today because when i saw the video he made yesterday that's
[2:04:19.040 --> 2:04:24.960]  already viral on youtube the emergency release he did it's up on info wars dot com i i got very
[2:04:24.960 --> 2:04:30.080]  disquieted feeling because the way he was laying it out and breaking it out and how many times not
[2:04:30.080 --> 2:04:35.040]  just the anthrax situation that he's been the first to lay it out accurately that's what really
[2:04:35.040 --> 2:04:41.120]  concerns me so is it a hoax is it hype is the hype what we're seeing for the police state
[2:04:41.120 --> 2:04:46.720]  or is this the beginning of a beta test of how does it tie into baxter shipping out the weaponized
[2:04:46.720 --> 2:04:51.200]  bird flu to be mixed with vaccines in europe it's all coming up our websites are info wars dot com

[2:08:27.600 --> 2:08:32.960]  time than in the youtube video but really break down all of our facets of this is going to horowitz
[2:08:32.960 --> 2:08:37.600]  is internationally known authority in overlapping fields of public health behavioral science
[2:08:37.600 --> 2:08:42.160]  emerging diseases and natural healing in 99 he was voted author of the year by the world

[2:09:42.160 --> 2:09:49.360]  medicine to study a whole bunch of different issues and medical situations just goes on and on with
[2:09:49.360 --> 2:09:54.960]  this bio i'm going to cut it off there and go via a video skype connection as we're live here at
[2:09:54.960 --> 2:10:01.440]  prisonplanet.tv to dr linda horowitz sir can you recap what you broke down in the video that we've
[2:10:01.440 --> 2:10:08.000]  got up on info wars.com and on your site tetrahedron.org and others and then tie this into the overall
[2:10:08.000 --> 2:10:14.000]  strategic operation of the new world order and whether you think this flu is it or a beta test
[2:10:14.000 --> 2:10:20.640]  for something larger that napolitano chillingly said sunday is going to be coming on the heels
[2:10:20.640 --> 2:10:26.560]  of this very very cryptic dr linda horowitz thank you for joining us thank you alex you know it's
[2:10:26.560 --> 2:10:32.160]  really hard to say but what tipped me off was it didn't make any sense that we had a multiple
[2:10:32.160 --> 2:10:37.920]  strain three different strains we have a swan flu the avian flu and the spanish flu that was
[2:10:37.920 --> 2:10:44.960]  actually engineered in the laboratories down in now novavax but as uh they had to get those strains
[2:10:44.960 --> 2:10:51.200]  from the cdc they got them from england and so i started to do some research and you know the sky
[2:10:51.200 --> 2:10:59.840]  rocketing stock values at novavax which produces the vaccine really is a tip off for me you know
[2:10:59.840 --> 2:11:06.000]  you follow the money i know you do that very well and it followed me to a dr james robertson
[2:11:06.000 --> 2:11:12.080]  england's leading bioengineer of viruses for the vaccine industry he's an avid promoter of
[2:11:12.080 --> 2:11:19.120]  u.s government funding for lucrative biodefense and uh bioengineering contracts along with his
[2:11:19.120 --> 2:11:25.520]  collaborators at the cdc the whole thing smacks as a public relations ploy to sell a lot of vaccines
[2:11:25.520 --> 2:11:31.760]  which are very very deadly and that essentially when you really look at what these people have
[2:11:31.760 --> 2:11:39.440]  done that before we even heard about this outbreak that is the day that we heard about
[2:11:39.440 --> 2:11:44.080]  actually the day that the mexican officials began to say that they may have some cases of this
[2:11:44.960 --> 2:11:52.640]  flu they had actually just that day virtually published in the journal of virology that this was
[2:11:53.280 --> 2:11:59.760]  what they were about in preclinical studies and so it's really absolutely ludicrous to think
[2:11:59.760 --> 2:12:07.520]  that this just happened by nature somehow an avian flu from asia would combine with a swine flu
[2:12:07.520 --> 2:12:15.360]  from mexico combined with a spanish flu from a 1918 corpse and now suddenly gets into a human
[2:12:15.360 --> 2:12:19.840]  in any other way than the government manipulation is absolutely ludicrous
[2:12:22.720 --> 2:12:28.640]  dr horowitz continue break down these connections and uh now we see the governor declaring emergency
[2:12:28.640 --> 2:12:33.520]  in texas the feds declaring emergency they're admitting that the world health organization
[2:12:33.520 --> 2:12:39.840]  the un is in control of our government's response the secretary general the un bragged about that
[2:12:39.840 --> 2:12:46.480]  that mr moon yesterday uh we have all of this right now coming together and if you've just got a few
[2:12:46.480 --> 2:12:53.600]  deaths in mexico a couple hundred unless they're lying one death in houston texas then then and
[2:12:53.600 --> 2:12:59.360]  the flu normally kills tens of thousands a year in the us alone just the regular flu why are they
[2:12:59.360 --> 2:13:05.840]  hyping this then so much in closing schools and uh and and and talking about bringing in
[2:13:05.840 --> 2:13:11.680]  literal martial law uh what does your nose tell you from all your deep research on this one
[2:13:12.880 --> 2:13:17.440]  you know i suspect strongly that they're pushing for the mandatory vaccinations which are going
[2:13:17.440 --> 2:13:23.680]  to cause the major depopulation i think that uh the incriminating evidence and giving giving you
[2:13:23.680 --> 2:13:28.800]  some names and i believe that these people should be really held to the burner they really should
[2:13:28.800 --> 2:13:34.640]  be brought before uh some sort of a grand jury the scientists at the u.s. centers for disease control
[2:13:34.640 --> 2:13:40.560]  that are implicated through their collaborations with the organization called nova vax and the
[2:13:40.560 --> 2:13:48.160]  co-authors of publications that i've reviewed uh the influenza branch director at the cdc his name
[2:13:48.160 --> 2:13:56.880]  is ruben o donis and dr rick bright used to work for donis at the cdc he's now at nova vax you know
[2:13:56.880 --> 2:14:01.680]  the revolving door there is between the drug industrialists and the government officials
[2:14:01.680 --> 2:14:07.680]  well that's the same thing that's happened here with nova vax as vice president of global influenza
[2:14:07.680 --> 2:14:15.440]  programs used to be working at the cdc so there's this corporate governmental alliance here to
[2:14:15.440 --> 2:14:21.920]  commit what amounts to genocide the mass killing of people for profit uh there's additional conspiracy
[2:14:21.920 --> 2:14:29.040]  evidence when you really begin to go deeper and you know what i think the most hideous thing when i
[2:14:29.040 --> 2:14:36.160]  say deeper i want to talk about the genetic uh implications the genetic associations of these
[2:14:36.160 --> 2:14:43.280]  vaccines associate with this particular outbreak uh but i think that the most hideous reality
[2:14:43.280 --> 2:14:49.360]  tragic reality that i've looked at is when you look at dr james robertson's testimony before the
[2:14:49.360 --> 2:14:56.240]  world health organization just a couple years ago these people in behind closed doors these are the
[2:14:56.240 --> 2:15:01.680]  people by the way that are making the money from the vaccine sales and the technology for the genetic
[2:15:01.680 --> 2:15:08.640]  engineering to produce these germs in their labs these people already decided behind closed doors
[2:15:08.640 --> 2:15:17.040]  that they would inject or inoculate the population or spray the population somehow seed these viruses
[2:15:17.040 --> 2:15:23.040]  exactly like you're looking at with this flu a combination of spanish flu virtually all the
[2:15:23.040 --> 2:15:28.880]  feared the most feared flues they kind of like mixed together into this cocktail flu and that's what
[2:15:28.880 --> 2:15:34.560]  it is and they said in their closed door meetings that they would be doing this seeding actually
[2:15:34.560 --> 2:15:42.400]  the populations beforehand they give the excuse or the rationale that this may be better off with
[2:15:42.400 --> 2:15:50.400]  less people dying in the end if they basically unwittingly unwitting populations disseminate
[2:15:50.400 --> 2:15:57.840]  disperse these kinds of bio weapons and that that would raise their saying immunity and so you know
[2:15:57.840 --> 2:16:05.120]  it's flies in the face of ethical medicine it flies in the face of of public health because
[2:16:05.120 --> 2:16:11.360]  it's not really uh healthy in fact if you simply just looked at all the people you were creating
[2:16:11.360 --> 2:16:17.600]  in terms of phobic reactions there are a lot of people who are on meds today that are depressed
[2:16:17.600 --> 2:16:22.240]  that are fearful they don't even go outside a lot of people they don't want to touch each other
[2:16:22.240 --> 2:16:27.360]  you know they don't want to shake hands anymore they're going to the fact is that we've got a major
[2:16:27.360 --> 2:16:32.400]  public health problem being overlooked in what the induction and anxiety and depression in the
[2:16:32.400 --> 2:16:37.840]  population is and you know it's insane alex i know that you know that so you're saying basically
[2:16:37.840 --> 2:16:43.840]  you believe this overalls a hype psiop and that the real action will be in the vaccine
[2:16:43.840 --> 2:16:49.040]  that they're rolling out to the people that they've now terrorized and currently it the hype's also
[2:16:49.040 --> 2:16:54.800]  being used as a cover for the open establishment of the new bank of the world and carbon taxes
[2:16:54.800 --> 2:17:00.560]  treaties to restrict the second amendment now moving through the economy in freefall with a
[2:17:00.560 --> 2:17:06.000]  6.1 reduction implosion in the last quarter now do you believe this is being used as an overall
[2:17:06.000 --> 2:17:11.840]  smoke screen for other issues yeah i think that's very accurate yeah i i suspect straw i mean it's
[2:17:11.840 --> 2:17:17.360]  very very clear right now all of the most hideous plagues that we're witnessing from the cancer
[2:17:17.360 --> 2:17:24.320]  pandemics today to the chronic fatigue phobromyalgia the autoimmune diseases the whole array i mean
[2:17:24.320 --> 2:17:30.080]  we've done programs on this before this is where the drug industrials not only make money but they
[2:17:30.080 --> 2:17:36.160]  also reduce the populations it's control that's why it's called centers for disease control it's
[2:17:36.160 --> 2:17:43.840]  not con centers for disease elimination remedial action they they've even dropped the prevention
[2:17:43.840 --> 2:17:52.080]  it's just called cdc today amazing now dr. Horowitz i want to go back through and you're not just
[2:17:52.080 --> 2:17:54.880]  saying that you have documentation behind everything you've been discussing with all the
[2:17:54.880 --> 2:18:01.600]  articles up on your site if you just google though mainstream news about the mixing of
[2:18:01.600 --> 2:18:06.640]  flues they admit they've been mixing at literally hundreds of labs or probably more than that
[2:18:07.200 --> 2:18:12.000]  but hundreds per year that i've seen different bird flues different swine flows with human flues
[2:18:12.000 --> 2:18:18.320]  and then people like baxter thank god got caught bloomberg reported it mailing weaponized bird
[2:18:18.320 --> 2:18:22.480]  flew that if you get it kills 90 percent of people but it's not airborne yet to mix it with
[2:18:22.480 --> 2:18:30.800]  regular spectrums of human flu to mix all that RNA together and to then have it given out as
[2:18:30.800 --> 2:18:35.280]  vaccines and then simultaneously all these homeless people start dying and it's in the
[2:18:35.280 --> 2:18:39.760]  london telegraph and other papers that quote an unnamed biological firm at the very same time
[2:18:39.760 --> 2:18:46.160]  paid city workers cash to lie to the workers to the homeless and others and tell them take this
[2:18:46.160 --> 2:18:52.800]  regular flu shot and it turned out they're dying of the bird flu what is going on dr. Horowitz well
[2:18:52.800 --> 2:18:59.360]  that's what you're saying is exactly what they're doing and so that now that we see this kind of a
[2:18:59.360 --> 2:19:06.640]  virus suddenly never in the history of humanity has this combination a recombinant of the swine
[2:19:06.640 --> 2:19:14.080]  flu the sparrows flew the avian flew plus they've got insect parts in it too by the way uh this is
[2:19:14.080 --> 2:19:22.000]  a description of totally diagnostic it's called pathodinomonic it's a slam dunk in other words
[2:19:22.000 --> 2:19:28.560]  diagnosis that the virus came from robertson's circle of friends you know and the robertson
[2:19:28.560 --> 2:19:33.840]  again is the chief head honcho in europe and this is a lot it's all coming down from europe

[2:24:15.520 --> 2:24:26.640]  riding on his horse he's going the distance notice my copy cup has a little pig on it uh dr
[2:24:26.640 --> 2:24:32.400]  horowitz from your research this isn't coming from pigs is what you're saying all the other doctors
[2:24:32.400 --> 2:24:37.280]  and virologists we've talked to and even people on singing in generals who are experts in bio weapons
[2:24:37.280 --> 2:24:42.320]  are saying this was probably made in the lab uh and then people even be going what's your proof
[2:24:42.320 --> 2:24:46.800]  for that what's your proof well it's in the wrong hemisphere where it started it's not during the flu
[2:24:46.800 --> 2:24:51.760]  season i've been studying this for years and are being people like yourself and others and the
[2:24:51.760 --> 2:24:57.040]  folks have been saying the bird flu was engineered because it has these markers can you explain that
[2:24:57.040 --> 2:25:04.080]  to people the i mean recap the evidence of why this is a slam dunk as you and others are saying
[2:25:04.080 --> 2:25:09.360]  that it is engineered and then secondarily is it race specific because it looks like it's only
[2:25:09.360 --> 2:25:14.720]  killing hispanics including hispanics in this country and it seems it's making hispanics more ill
[2:25:16.720 --> 2:25:21.440]  well you know i think that i'm getting more specific than that i would like to put some people
[2:25:22.160 --> 2:25:27.600]  indict some people and put them on a witness stand and i have those people those people number one
[2:25:27.600 --> 2:25:35.280]  are james robertson and odonis at the cdc and rick brighton overvax and here's why i say that
[2:25:35.280 --> 2:25:45.040]  because no other group in the world takes h5n1 asian infected chickens brings them to europe
[2:25:45.040 --> 2:25:55.040]  extracts their dna combines proteins with h1n1 viruses from the 1918 spanish flu isolate
[2:25:55.040 --> 2:26:03.680]  additionally mixes it and swine flu genes from pigs then reverse engineers them to infect humans
[2:26:03.680 --> 2:26:09.360]  this is the only group in the world alexa does that these people should be brought before the
[2:26:09.360 --> 2:26:14.960]  american public before the unfortunately we can't trust the judicial system that's why i suggest
[2:26:14.960 --> 2:26:20.880]  the grand jury but the reality is the end product that roiders and the officials are currently
[2:26:20.880 --> 2:26:28.480]  describing to describe this virus is pathomomonic the mixture that these guys have been working on
[2:26:28.480 --> 2:26:35.040]  again they published they put out their press releases basically at the exact time that this
[2:26:35.040 --> 2:26:40.960]  broke in mexico before we even heard about it was the precise time that they started to release
[2:26:40.960 --> 2:26:48.240]  all of their promotional literature their stock went heavily from low to high so this is just like
[2:26:48.240 --> 2:26:54.320]  this is just a general this is just like 9 11 when we see record all-time highs still for
[2:26:54.320 --> 2:27:01.040]  a short betting against united american not just airline stocks united american specifically and
[2:27:01.040 --> 2:27:08.720]  then it led back to alex brown and a buzzy crown guard of the cia and then that investigation got
[2:27:08.720 --> 2:27:13.200]  shut down so that's how you're fingering these guys because i've seen their names and i did notice
[2:27:13.200 --> 2:27:18.080]  the promotion in the last few weeks leading up to this and then lo and behold you go look
[2:27:18.080 --> 2:27:23.040]  at what they're developing and they admit that they're splicing all of the things that look
[2:27:23.040 --> 2:27:29.440]  just like uh this how does how does uh baxter who they're saying is getting the world health
[2:27:29.440 --> 2:27:34.800]  organization contract to develop the vaccine how do they tie in out of hundreds of companies
[2:27:34.800 --> 2:27:41.280]  why is the un picking the one company dr horowitz uh that specifically got caught in 18 countries
[2:27:41.280 --> 2:27:46.560]  ordering their subsidiaries to mix live bird flu with the vaccine stock well again look at
[2:27:46.560 --> 2:27:52.960]  baxter's history i mean you're looking at i g farbans prodigy here you know progeny you know it's
[2:27:52.960 --> 2:27:59.040]  it's the same old same old that you and i have seen and it's sad because you know alex i think
[2:27:59.040 --> 2:28:04.400]  we're getting to the end of this game this is like you know end game you know this is basically we've
[2:28:04.400 --> 2:28:10.400]  got the emperor's new clothes the emperor's completely new and people see it people are
[2:28:10.400 --> 2:28:15.600]  screaming about it now more than ever before and yet the parade just keeps marching along the
[2:28:15.600 --> 2:28:21.760]  mainstream media keeps playing the deception and and really it's gotten to the point where
[2:28:21.760 --> 2:28:27.200]  we've got to do something we do have a plan by the way it's called live h2o concert for the
[2:28:27.200 --> 2:28:33.040]  living water this coming june 19th of the 21st where we can make a big shift we're looking at
[2:28:33.040 --> 2:28:39.120]  the need for that hundredth monkey in in the parade in the stands in the where the parade is
[2:28:39.120 --> 2:28:45.280]  marching if we can get about a hundred one out of a hundred people to start screaming like you've
[2:28:45.280 --> 2:28:49.840]  been screaming over the airways and i've been screaming all these years you know i think what
[2:28:49.840 --> 2:28:55.680]  we're going to have is this conspiracy of silence where we're afraid to speak up the reality is if
[2:28:55.680 --> 2:29:00.480]  we don't we may lose not just our lives of our children and our children's children we've got
[2:29:00.480 --> 2:29:04.640]  30 minutes left with you and i'll hold you five minutes into the next hour so we get a full hour

[2:29:42.560 --> 2:29:46.800]  you'd gone over the deep end you know back then to day one say what it was and you were proven

[2:33:47.280 --> 2:33:51.600]  it and it's it's stunning and i know you don't just come out and say something and i respected
[2:33:51.600 --> 2:33:56.720]  you back in 2001 but you know it was like here's who did it here's how they did it fort detrick
[2:33:56.720 --> 2:34:02.480]  weaponized this is all alive you know and then it freaked him out so bad the fbi came after you
[2:34:02.480 --> 2:34:09.360]  briefly recap that story before you get into your evidence on this one well it's actually
[2:34:09.360 --> 2:34:14.800]  batel memorial institute west jefferson ohio and how i was able to determine that was the
[2:34:14.800 --> 2:34:20.640]  primary source for the anthrax is because there was a lot of evidence that suggested that they
[2:34:20.640 --> 2:34:27.200]  were the only ones who had the capability the technology to produce not only a hyper weaponized
[2:34:27.200 --> 2:34:34.320]  strain of anthrax it was silica cut it would spread it was electromagnetized it was hyper
[2:34:34.320 --> 2:34:40.240]  concentrated and there was only one laboratory really in the world and it wasn't at fort detrick
[2:34:40.240 --> 2:34:46.160]  fort detrick received it from them there was only one in the world that had the uh capacity to test
[2:34:46.160 --> 2:34:53.360]  that it was and to produce it it was at batel memorial institute and the aerosolized laboratories
[2:34:53.360 --> 2:34:59.920]  and so that's how i was able to actually one week before the first anthrax mailing was announced
[2:34:59.920 --> 2:35:05.440]  to the press i actually marched into the fbi headquarters in northern idaho because i saw
[2:35:05.440 --> 2:35:09.840]  the whole thing unfolding you know when i saw that's right now i remember i remember that's
[2:35:09.840 --> 2:35:13.040]  what i thought you'd gone crazy that's right because i haven't reread this in years that's
[2:35:13.040 --> 2:35:17.440]  right it's here you came out before it happened and went into their headquarters and you were on
[2:35:17.440 --> 2:35:21.760]  genesis warning everybody and i'm like what's he doing talking about anthrax please continue
[2:35:22.640 --> 2:35:29.120]  yeah that's exactly right and so you know the fbi never responded until eight about six months later
[2:35:29.120 --> 2:35:35.520]  afterwards you know when i kept hounding them and i met i was banging everybody miller uh you
[2:35:35.520 --> 2:35:42.720]  know fbi director miller on down for negligence and official malfeasance of course the cia was
[2:35:42.720 --> 2:35:47.760]  basically suppressing all of that i saw you know it was coming i mean i i mean sure it's one thing
[2:35:47.760 --> 2:35:52.080]  when it breaks within a day to come out and finger the right people but how did you beforehand know
[2:35:52.080 --> 2:35:59.840]  well because i had just in june of 2001 i published the book death in the air globalism
[2:35:59.840 --> 2:36:06.000]  terrorism and toxic warfare nobody before september 11th very few people there was steve quayle who
[2:36:06.000 --> 2:36:10.480]  you're gonna have as a guest soon steve and i were virtually the only people out there is this
[2:36:10.480 --> 2:36:15.520]  saying that we've got some major bioterrorism happening white-colored bioterrorism by our own
[2:36:15.520 --> 2:36:21.600]  government and so you know i had actually done all the questions looked at all the questions of
[2:36:21.600 --> 2:36:28.400]  what they were doing aerosolized sprays and and anthrax i had been studying for about three years
[2:36:28.400 --> 2:36:35.520]  and so when i saw peter jennings on the uh evening news say this was two weeks after september 11th
[2:36:36.240 --> 2:36:41.760]  he said tomorrow we're going to cover anthrax we're going through your fears one by one
[2:36:41.760 --> 2:36:48.400]  day by day good night i said oh man i gotta watch this program so i put it on and it was a commercial
[2:36:48.400 --> 2:36:55.760]  for bear sip row and i go all these smoke bear corporation is ig farben it was the basis for
[2:36:55.760 --> 2:37:01.520]  the germanese and the holocaust manipulation of the populations and the intoxications that have
[2:37:01.520 --> 2:37:07.200]  come out of nazi germany experimentation knowingly as you know for those that don't know just got
[2:37:07.200 --> 2:37:12.560]  caught for decades shipping out knowing every ampule of factor eight had hiv an appetite as a death
[2:37:12.560 --> 2:37:17.600]  sentence and the documents came out msnbc reported they knew it and did it on purpose and they said
[2:37:17.600 --> 2:37:23.040]  oh they were cold blooded didn't care no this is eugenics please continue that's exactly right
[2:37:23.040 --> 2:37:29.840]  and so that's how i was able to you know get that and then this particular case really alex it's a
[2:37:29.840 --> 2:37:34.400]  no-brainer you know you have to ask number you have to ask a couple questions number one what
[2:37:34.400 --> 2:37:42.160]  would be the statistical probability for this kind of a virus to not be a laboratory creation
[2:37:42.160 --> 2:37:48.000]  you've got to ask yourself how is it that an asian chicken virus could come up with a spanish
[2:37:48.000 --> 2:37:56.560]  flu virus could come from it 1918 mind you couple that with a swine and couple that with a reverse
[2:37:56.560 --> 2:38:04.000]  engineering for humans with a little bit of insect part and european virus engaged and you've
[2:38:04.000 --> 2:38:09.680]  got to ask well what's the probability then that that would happen by nature or you know
[2:38:09.680 --> 2:38:17.040]  that you know synchronicity or uh serendipity and you you can't you can't even go there it's
[2:38:17.040 --> 2:38:22.560]  ridiculously remote what's the opposite the opposite well what is the likelihood that
[2:38:23.120 --> 2:38:30.560]  dr james robertson and his group of the most powerful people in the world in biological
[2:38:30.560 --> 2:38:37.200]  weapons research and development and vaccinations and specifically flu when you talk about flu
[2:38:37.200 --> 2:38:43.280]  when you talk about bio preparedness for influenza and these types of viruses you must
[2:38:43.280 --> 2:38:50.240]  go to robertson he is the gatekeeper for the multi-billion dollar vaccine stockpiling deals
[2:38:50.240 --> 2:38:57.280]  he's got the influence over the european medicines agency the ena it's a quasi corporate quasi
[2:38:57.280 --> 2:39:03.200]  scientific think tank that serves the european economic union and the drug industry so you've
[2:39:03.200 --> 2:39:08.320]  got to go to robertson and when you go to robertson and you see what he's been researching over the
[2:39:08.320 --> 2:39:15.040]  last four or five years his whole group has been focused on exactly the development of this vaccine
[2:39:15.040 --> 2:39:24.720]  for this precise virus so it's a no-brainer alex uh donter horowitz uh let's go back through some
[2:39:24.720 --> 2:39:27.760]  more of the evidence you've been breaking down on the articles and videos you've been putting up
[2:39:28.320 --> 2:39:32.240]  but first i want to just ask you somebody who's been in depth like nobody else researching this
[2:39:32.240 --> 2:39:38.480]  and from a medical perspective and talking to all the world experts how bad is this flu from the
[2:39:38.480 --> 2:39:46.880]  preliminary info we have one dead person in houston a 23 year old 23 month old baby toddler
[2:39:46.880 --> 2:39:52.400]  but he was in mexico city and then brought up 15 days ago up into brownsville and then
[2:39:53.280 --> 2:39:58.880]  to houston so is this race specific because it only continues to kill hispanics or is it
[2:39:58.880 --> 2:40:03.520]  just that it's been incubating longer and there's been more cases in mexico so the first death we're
[2:40:03.520 --> 2:40:09.120]  going to see statistically will be hispanics or mexicans uh where do you see this going where do
[2:40:09.120 --> 2:40:14.160]  you see the marshal law implications with all these states of emergency season the un saying we're
[2:40:14.160 --> 2:40:19.040]  about to go to level five then we can order quarantining and forced inoculation what do you see
[2:40:19.040 --> 2:40:25.680]  that will be in that vaccine well there's a lot of questions there you know i think that that
[2:40:25.680 --> 2:40:32.240]  it's not a particularly gruesome virus i don't see that the major death rates it's certainly
[2:40:32.240 --> 2:40:38.880]  nowhere like 90 kill like in some populations with Ebola you know i think the most chilling evidence
[2:40:38.880 --> 2:40:45.680]  though against dr robertson and his economic union research team besides being the gatekeeper
[2:40:45.680 --> 2:40:51.440]  and the chief promoter of these multi-billion dollar vaccine deals is his warning that he actually
[2:40:51.440 --> 2:41:00.720]  it wasn't a warning here's a quote from april 27 2006 it was a scientific discussion that was behind
[2:41:00.720 --> 2:41:07.440]  closed doors with a world health organization working group wherein he recommended that quote
[2:41:07.440 --> 2:41:14.240]  they would use primary i'm sorry they would prime the population in advance of pandemics
[2:41:14.240 --> 2:41:20.640]  reaching either the uk or other nations now what does that mean pruning that's what i think this
[2:41:20.640 --> 2:41:26.160]  is i think that they have already started to prime and i think that you have because they've
[2:41:26.160 --> 2:41:34.160]  started to release or lose these things that they call biosimilars uh and or mock-up files they
[2:41:34.160 --> 2:41:38.560]  call them different names now they don't want you to they don't want to say virus you know in
[2:41:38.560 --> 2:41:43.920]  their behind closed door means they're reading real they're reading real super viruses is what
[2:41:43.920 --> 2:41:48.480]  other medical doctors and virologists we've had on are you saying this is a beta test to scare
[2:41:48.480 --> 2:41:53.440]  everybody to test their police state grid and to script it and cast it that the government's the
[2:41:53.440 --> 2:41:58.640]  savior and then they're going to fix this problem but then also this virus from what other scientists
[2:41:58.640 --> 2:42:04.880]  are saying is this is a carrier virus because it has all these different dna uh systems the rna
[2:42:04.880 --> 2:42:10.720]  systems so that it can jump through animals uh you name it and spread uh and that it's meant to
[2:42:10.720 --> 2:42:15.360]  mutate or be combined with something else that is the big megadeth uh driver
[2:42:15.360 --> 2:42:22.640]  uh driver you know all of the above you think about it there's a lot of money being made in
[2:42:22.640 --> 2:42:28.720]  bio preparedness look at all of this you know look at the media alone is making so much money
[2:42:28.720 --> 2:42:35.520]  from the hype so when you consider what is at stake here besides the population reduction agenda
[2:42:35.520 --> 2:42:40.720]  which is foremost but they've got to do it in the most profitable way that's what their game plan
[2:42:40.720 --> 2:42:46.880]  has always been so they've got them making money hand over fist every which way possible with this
[2:42:46.880 --> 2:42:52.560]  thing so killings their business business is good they always make money off their phony drug wars
[2:42:52.560 --> 2:42:58.000]  their wars their police state they're making money off of this i mean because think about it tens of
[2:42:58.000 --> 2:43:02.160]  thousands die every year in the us of flu in mexico and this is only a few hundred they're
[2:43:02.160 --> 2:43:07.920]  acting like it's the end of the world right so you're saying this is a primer or a beta test
[2:43:07.920 --> 2:43:13.680]  i i don't think it's the real thing i think it's created and if if it is you know kind of like
[2:43:14.640 --> 2:43:19.920]  part of my prayer you know if i were to pray for the best outcome of what this virus really is
[2:43:20.480 --> 2:43:27.680]  that it that it would be a legitimate escape from you know you know it's hard to it's hard to even
[2:43:27.680 --> 2:43:34.240]  believe that though because the reality is that it's mexico it's not atlanta it's not the fez the
[2:43:34.240 --> 2:43:39.680]  maryland where they got their labs so it's just like the anthrax what the hell did it end up doing
[2:43:39.680 --> 2:43:46.160]  down there in bokeh rattan florida mailed specifically to these guys who were like
[2:43:46.160 --> 2:43:52.960]  you know engaged as they were as inside dealers and uh i'm sure you probably know the connections
[2:43:52.960 --> 2:43:58.880]  with 9 11 and the bokeh rattan organization america media so they were there were specific
[2:43:58.880 --> 2:44:06.880]  agendas being served they were served when the anthrax was mailed to uh the legislators
[2:44:07.440 --> 2:44:13.760]  there were specific agendas being served when they were mailed to uh brokaw so it's kind of
[2:44:13.760 --> 2:44:19.360]  like these are all messages here these are all messages i want to ask you a separate question
[2:44:19.360 --> 2:44:25.040]  why would air force one fly between the buildings with f-16s terrorizing people we said that we knew
[2:44:25.040 --> 2:44:29.920]  that it would terrorize that you know that they knew that that it would and now they admit it yes
[2:44:29.920 --> 2:44:34.400]  we knew it would terrorize you we ordered the police and fbi not to warn people and not to tell
[2:44:34.400 --> 2:44:39.680]  them what it was and to let them do it so they're now admitting they're running scyops why did they
[2:44:39.680 --> 2:44:47.280]  do that scyop well again terror is is part of this whole manipulation of the population you know
[2:44:47.280 --> 2:44:52.960]  you know you're either in fear or you're in love you're at peace and joy and love or you're in your
[2:44:52.960 --> 2:44:59.920]  egoic manipulated mind control mass mediated hyped brain so they get away to remind everybody of
[2:44:59.920 --> 2:45:08.560]  911 well no i think it's a generic neurotic i mean this is my area of expertise and this is how i saw
[2:45:08.560 --> 2:45:14.880]  the scyops being run that's why i went to the fbi i saw this whole thing unfolding in the media
[2:45:14.880 --> 2:45:21.600]  and this is what they're doing now if you look at the whole population reduction agenda read the
[2:45:21.600 --> 2:45:28.480]  book folks listening death in the air globalism terrorism and toxic warfare you'll get the complete
[2:45:28.480 --> 2:45:37.040]  understanding of what is happening it is simply the uh the revolution in military affairs whereby
[2:45:37.040 --> 2:45:43.680]  they're using biological cocktails which has a combination of things that you can't trace and to
[2:45:43.680 --> 2:45:51.280]  do it they've got to run these extreme extensive scyops where they're literally creating fear
[2:45:51.280 --> 2:45:56.400]  inducing all of this fear problem reaction solution if people are freaking out then the
[2:45:56.400 --> 2:46:03.280]  legislators in congress have a good excuse for voting for the the scams and giving all the
[2:46:03.280 --> 2:46:08.880]  money to the people that are paying them off on capitol hill this is what's required so it's
[2:46:08.880 --> 2:46:14.400]  silent quiet weapons for quiet wars i agree with you and and it's not just they're trying to create
[2:46:14.400 --> 2:46:20.400]  a new rose seas of fear in us they are neurotic like regular garden variety psychopaths are
[2:46:20.400 --> 2:46:25.280]  where they have to flaunt their power over their victims like psychos mailing letters
[2:46:25.280 --> 2:46:30.320]  to the police taunting them is that what you're saying yes absolutely i mean there's a lot of
[2:46:30.320 --> 2:46:35.600]  trauma when you talk about neuroticism you're looking at trauma you look at look at the way
[2:46:35.600 --> 2:46:45.120]  medicine operates and in fact you know i have a hard time judging this fellow uh james uh robertson
[2:46:45.120 --> 2:46:51.120]  as as somebody probably should a good court of law definitely needs to get these people maybe a
[2:46:51.120 --> 2:46:56.400]  congressional investigation or some some legitimate investigating group i don't know if we have that
[2:46:56.400 --> 2:47:01.520]  on planet earth anymore but the reality is you know when you look at medicine and you look at
[2:47:01.520 --> 2:47:10.160]  academic tracking and science it's all largely if not completely Rockefeller controlled you only get
[2:47:10.160 --> 2:47:17.920]  grants to do research when they tell you a grant application is requested or open they track you
[2:47:17.920 --> 2:47:24.160]  and look at the way doctors are trained it's trauma-based learning it's no different from any
[2:47:24.160 --> 2:47:32.080]  cult it is a cult manipulation indoctrination method that uses trauma fear you know you're in
[2:47:32.080 --> 2:47:37.600]  competition you you don't go you don't sleep you know they've got you in the residency programs
[2:47:37.600 --> 2:47:45.440]  you don't sleep for 48 hours it's definitely a deprivation and traumatization whereby then you
[2:47:45.440 --> 2:47:50.800]  become a virtual man sharing a candidate who thinks they're doing good it's not so it's like
[2:47:50.800 --> 2:47:55.600]  marine corps boys are doing it's like marine corps training but for the mind with no sleep
[2:47:55.600 --> 2:48:00.320]  competition being washed out and by the time they're out the doctors literally are like a
[2:48:00.320 --> 2:48:04.480]  tomaton zombies who don't question they do what the am a tells them and then meanwhile they're
[2:48:04.480 --> 2:48:09.200]  all compartmentalized and you see doctors and dentists have the highest rates of heart attacks
[2:48:09.200 --> 2:48:16.480]  and suicides you know and that's why I think that there's only a few at the very top you know
[2:48:16.480 --> 2:48:22.480]  the people that I really distrust or Harold Jaffe who's in charge of the Americas the
[2:48:22.480 --> 2:48:27.920]  infectious disease agency you know national institute for allergies and infectious diseases
[2:48:27.920 --> 2:48:35.440]  this guy knows what's going on this guy knows that AIDS was created and injected by Merck
[2:48:35.440 --> 2:48:41.040]  pharmaceutical hepatitis B vaccines into gay men in New York and blacks in central Africa
[2:48:41.040 --> 2:48:47.760]  between 1972 and 74 all of this is definitive it's science it's rock science and that's why
[2:48:47.760 --> 2:48:51.760]  I've published not just the book emerging viruses but also in the scientific literature
[2:48:51.760 --> 2:48:58.720]  peer review science but yet look at what is the media doing neglecting genocide neglecting the
[2:48:58.720 --> 2:49:04.560]  fact that our children and our children's children are being decimated genetically and through the
[2:49:04.560 --> 2:49:09.600]  chemical the mercury is all during the DNA for those that don't know it's all during the DNA
[2:49:09.600 --> 2:49:14.640]  irrevocably in fact I mean I know people all over 25 year old women 22 year old women
[2:49:14.640 --> 2:49:19.040]  everybody I know who's got a friend or a business partner somebody in their band dying of cancer
[2:49:19.040 --> 2:49:24.240]  kids are dying all over my neighborhood and when 20 years ago it was rare to see a kid with cancer
[2:49:24.240 --> 2:49:30.080]  we are under total bio weapon attack they have incrementally turned up the background ambient
[2:49:30.080 --> 2:49:34.800]  chemical biological radiological attacks on us and that's how I saw 9 11 coming just like you
[2:49:34.800 --> 2:49:39.680]  saw the anthrax coming was the preconditioning here's al-qaeda they're going to get you give
[2:49:39.680 --> 2:49:44.160]  your rights up when they attack and I do remember them hyping anthrax and who they're going to get
[2:49:44.160 --> 2:49:49.760]  you and you saw that and then were able to because you're right they are doing the preparatory phase
[2:49:49.760 --> 2:49:54.880]  and I've seen months and months and months of preparatory phase for bird flu for swine flu
[2:49:55.520 --> 2:49:59.200]  that's why a month ago I said on air I think the next card they're going to play
[2:49:59.200 --> 2:50:03.680]  is going to be some super flu and look what's happening so you can see it I can see it
[2:50:03.680 --> 2:50:07.840]  how do we get the public where they can see it and that comes up with the 100th monkey
[2:50:07.840 --> 2:50:11.600]  start talking about that I mean you know these studies where you've got an island with monkeys
[2:50:11.600 --> 2:50:16.480]  then as soon as you can train the monkeys on one island five miles away suddenly these monkeys know
[2:50:16.480 --> 2:50:23.280]  it as if there's some almost radio wave connection well you know the number one thing is you got to
[2:50:23.280 --> 2:50:28.640]  get people out of fear so to get them out of fear you got to have a holistic approach you know
[2:50:28.640 --> 2:50:33.520]  everything from oxy silver which is a protective I don't worry about this thing and you want to
[2:50:33.520 --> 2:50:38.880]  look at suppression look at what silver hydrosols have undergone the fact is that the government
[2:50:38.880 --> 2:50:44.800]  and the pharmaceutical industry has been suppressing the silver hydrosols again oxy silver is my
[2:50:44.800 --> 2:50:50.480]  favorite but you know you get the website give the website we got a break yeah oxysilver.com
[2:50:50.480 --> 2:50:57.520]  O X Y S I L D E R dot com all right we got a break oxysilver.com we'll be right back with Dr.

[2:52:06.080 --> 2:52:11.360]  is the tip of the spear we've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as
[2:52:11.360 --> 2:52:18.480]  powerful just as strong just as well funded the obama deception completely destroys the myth
[2:52:18.480 --> 2:52:23.760]  that obama is working for the best interest of the american people while obama's already fudging
[2:52:23.760 --> 2:52:29.120]  yeah fudged since day one in this election if you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement
[2:52:29.120 --> 2:52:36.480]  a personality cultist who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs

[2:56:07.440 --> 2:56:13.200]  and then the day after it came out you know when the to more detail uh just just amazing
[2:56:13.200 --> 2:56:18.480]  so as we want to commend him uh for his foresight and understanding of this and his great knowledge
[2:56:20.080 --> 2:56:23.760]  let's talk to don in texas don you're on the air with dr. Lynn horror let's go ahead
[2:56:23.760 --> 2:56:29.360]  hello dr. Horowitz and alex god bless and keep you for what you're doing i want to thank first
[2:56:29.360 --> 2:56:34.880]  first of all thank dr. Horowitz for literally saving my life through the publication of it
[2:56:34.880 --> 2:56:41.280]  of this book aids an ebola accident or intentional back in 1994 i used that information there to
[2:56:41.280 --> 2:56:47.440]  survive hepatitis c and i'm just so grateful for him for providing it my question for you both is
[2:56:47.440 --> 2:56:55.280]  there a possibility that you and tetrahedron dot org get together and draw up a list of indictable
[2:56:55.280 --> 2:57:00.240]  offenses that we could put in front of our grand juries at a county level throughout the united
[2:57:00.240 --> 2:57:07.440]  states well that's a great question brother thank you so much you know my area of expertise is not
[2:57:07.440 --> 2:57:14.560]  law uh and if you can put together a group of volunteer attorneys who might be able to advance
[2:57:14.560 --> 2:57:19.360]  that uh and maybe with the sovereignty movement you we don't even need to go that route maybe
[2:57:19.360 --> 2:57:25.440]  what we could do is uh some other uh mechanism by which these people can be brought uh to justice
[2:57:25.440 --> 2:57:30.000]  and be accountable well i have an idea i have an idea you know you can't get them at first for the
[2:57:30.000 --> 2:57:36.560]  big thing you start it with the fact that they are mixing weaponized level viruses together
[2:57:36.560 --> 2:57:41.440]  and then mailing them around so you go after them for endangering the public for gross neglect
[2:57:41.440 --> 2:57:45.920]  now there's a lot of charges you can prove they've done that then once you've gotten them in an
[2:57:45.920 --> 2:57:50.800]  investigation with a grand jury and you go after a bunch of these companies they'll start spilling
[2:57:50.800 --> 2:57:56.320]  their guts would you agree with that idea dr horowitz i sounds great you know at this point
[2:57:56.320 --> 2:58:02.640]  gee whiz you know i've got a plan to we'll have to do a show on live h2o again this coming summer
[2:58:02.640 --> 2:58:08.080]  solstice june 19th to the 21st i'd love to talk about the plan that i've got i believe that the
[2:58:08.080 --> 2:58:14.320]  creator has for us getting out of this mess but anything that people can do you know that that
[2:58:14.320 --> 2:58:22.160]  is going to help to save lives and to wake people up is going to be a blessing so i totally encourage
[2:58:22.960 --> 2:58:27.600]  everything that we can possibly do well i agree with you that it's at the core it's about the
[2:58:27.600 --> 2:58:32.640]  spirit the soul the mind if we break through break through mentally and stop being afraid
[2:58:32.640 --> 2:58:36.800]  then we can meet these people we have to believe in ourselves first though back in 70 seconds with

[3:09:18.480 --> 3:09:25.440]  growing in utero and cow uteruses that i saw in 1998 in the bbc and you tell the public this and
[3:09:25.440 --> 3:09:30.560]  they laugh at you because uh i guess they don't read the news south korean expert claims they've
[3:09:30.560 --> 3:09:37.280]  cloned glowing dogs and then that's a ap and then it actually shows video of them they didn't claim
[3:09:37.280 --> 3:09:42.720]  anything this has been out for over a decade with glowing dogs glowing jellyfish uh monkeys that
[3:09:43.520 --> 3:09:49.520]  glow with jellyfish genetics uh to be technical and so i wanted to bring steve quail up and get
[3:09:49.520 --> 3:09:57.760]  the latest information uh on this uh whole subject of the flu a few days has passed since i had steve
[3:09:57.760 --> 3:10:02.640]  on monday we uh were both guest together for two hours on coast to coast a m for extremely powerful
[3:10:03.280 --> 3:10:11.440]  transmission there's now been a death uh in texas but it was a mexican national 23 month old boy
[3:10:11.440 --> 3:10:18.640]  who came in in uh mid uh april about 15 days ago in the brownsville was transferred on the last week
[3:10:18.640 --> 3:10:27.440]  to uh houston where he died of this flu and uh if it only continues to kill mexicans is it
[3:10:27.440 --> 3:10:33.760]  race specific now because that is it'll make other uh you know varieties of homo sapiens sapiens
[3:10:33.760 --> 3:10:38.880]  sick but won't kill them or is this because they're chemically debilitated in mexico city
[3:10:38.880 --> 3:10:44.160]  where he came from all of this and more with steve quail in the next 50 minutes steve quail
[3:10:44.160 --> 3:10:49.520]  thanks for coming on with us thank you alex boy this is like uh all of these events are
[3:10:49.520 --> 3:10:56.480]  amping up in total i would say this total new world order scripted delight even as we're
[3:10:56.480 --> 3:11:02.880]  talking about this i think in fort mires florida the joint uh nato u.s military is having landing
[3:11:02.880 --> 3:11:07.760]  exercises you've probably seen the video have you not yeah i forgot that the bermas played it last
[3:11:07.760 --> 3:11:12.000]  night the senator he played it right yeah yeah it's really important for people to understand
[3:11:12.000 --> 3:11:16.960]  this secretary defense gates made the statement and ladies and gentlemen you need to listen to
[3:11:16.960 --> 3:11:22.400]  what alex and what i are saying and giving you the heads up secretary defense gates made a statement
[3:11:22.400 --> 3:11:27.520]  so astonishing yet it was totally uh glossed over by the mainstream media and simply this
[3:11:27.520 --> 3:11:33.280]  that due to the financial collapse and the calamities that are going to be coming on
[3:11:33.840 --> 3:11:38.720]  the united states during the summer he made an appeal to nato to send their troops did you see that
[3:11:38.720 --> 3:11:46.720]  that yes and in the fact alex said now we have a scripted and an orchestrated bogeyman on a
[3:11:46.720 --> 3:11:52.800]  worldwide scale i.e. and it should not be called a swine flu okay let's call it what it is a new
[3:11:52.800 --> 3:11:59.440]  world order cocktail of death okay because this thing is no more swine flu than uh bird flu
[3:11:59.440 --> 3:12:04.720]  with strictly bird flu we've talked about the genetic alteration of genomes and what that would
[3:12:04.720 --> 3:12:10.400]  mean now i i put up on my website the most critical story before people go poo pooing you and i about
[3:12:10.400 --> 3:12:17.440]  is this a bio or an ethnically a bio ethnically directed weapon they need to go and read the
[3:12:17.440 --> 3:12:21.520]  history of who already possesses such weapons it's not a question of can they develop them
[3:12:21.520 --> 3:12:26.160]  they're already developed you quoted uh with george uh nori the other night you remember
[3:12:26.160 --> 3:12:31.600]  uh the former vice president statement on it so where are we going now the exploding vials of
[3:12:31.600 --> 3:12:39.120]  swine flu quote their term new world order death cocktail my term uh in switzerland that actually
[3:12:39.120 --> 3:12:43.920]  was on the french swiss border in the area of fraybord the fascinating thing about this i think
[3:12:43.920 --> 3:12:49.120]  that's a declaration now that just as it's going to go down the united states it's going to go down
[3:12:49.120 --> 3:12:55.520]  in the european union we'll have our first glimpse of that as europe the eu the european union
[3:12:55.520 --> 3:13:02.480]  uh the euro dollar starts to go get sold off in unison with the u.s dollar the thing that's
[3:13:02.480 --> 3:13:07.360]  important for people understand this is scripted and alex as you and i've said in the past even
[3:13:07.360 --> 3:13:13.040]  if this isn't the full release of the most deadly biological pathogens in the world it is the most
[3:13:13.040 --> 3:13:18.800]  amazing field beta tests going on because they're tracking look their supercomputers are already
[3:13:18.800 --> 3:13:24.000]  projecting the outcome and whether the information is accurate or not we will never be told how many
[3:13:24.000 --> 3:13:29.200]  people are dying and separate until it serves their purpose and the only purpose that will serve
[3:13:29.200 --> 3:13:33.520]  is to basically get everybody into force uh mandatory vaccinations it isn't interesting
[3:13:33.520 --> 3:13:38.000]  that with the lead time that magazines take to come up with their stories time magazine has already
[3:13:38.000 --> 3:13:43.200]  got an article out as if they were tipped off that this will lead to forced and mandatory
[3:13:43.200 --> 3:13:48.720]  vaccinations and the laws implemented for a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine and so many
[3:13:48.720 --> 3:13:54.400]  years in prison already in the books and now it makes all those uh laughing hyenas maybe sit up
[3:13:54.400 --> 3:13:59.360]  and take notice that now the vehicles in place to make everybody have to take the vaccination
[3:13:59.360 --> 3:14:08.160]  those who refuse go to the camps it is so plain and apparent at this point now uh steve i i want
[3:14:08.160 --> 3:14:11.840]  to go back to what you just talked about about nato troops lay out the source of that let's
[3:14:11.840 --> 3:14:16.560]  spend some time on that perry announcing uh state of emergency in texas over one death
[3:14:16.560 --> 3:14:22.960]  uh this is just amazing uh and and then we also uh hear about how they may need to go to level five
[3:14:23.920 --> 3:14:28.480]  the head of the un secretary general brags that we are under un control that the us in
[3:14:28.480 --> 3:14:34.720]  mexico and other countries are following their orders and this is a great test of the un's control
[3:14:35.440 --> 3:14:40.880]  absolutely the security council obviously can order troops into any place that they feel is a
[3:14:40.880 --> 3:14:46.320]  destabilizing force to the world at large now remember alex this is the most important term
[3:14:46.320 --> 3:14:52.800]  your listeners can get into their minds is curative process it does not mean help them
[3:14:52.800 --> 3:14:58.720]  helping people by any means under the current agreements that are out there especially in
[3:14:58.720 --> 3:15:07.440]  the world of medical coordination and uh syncopation of activities it is the dilemma that is presented
[3:15:07.440 --> 3:15:13.440]  with people why are there only 450 million uh doses of vaccine you and i have been heralding
[3:15:13.440 --> 3:15:19.840]  for a decade the new world order wants 5.5 billion people killed there are 500 let's say
[3:15:19.840 --> 3:15:25.360]  approximately 500 million doses of effective vaccine what people don't understand is there
[3:15:25.360 --> 3:15:32.640]  are multiple multiple strains of this biological variant and virus that are being initiated and
[3:15:32.640 --> 3:15:39.360]  being uh uh put out there worldwide and that's the to keep all of the different uh bio labs
[3:15:39.360 --> 3:15:45.520]  off base so they cannot track it to a single source that's why you have a hundred scientists
[3:15:45.520 --> 3:15:50.800]  murdered over the space of the last eight years that's why the world's leading epidemiologists
[3:15:50.800 --> 3:15:56.400]  and virologists and molecular biologists and guys who's uh whose pedigrees would make a
[3:15:56.400 --> 3:16:01.520]  harvard yale and all the medical schools the world the most brilliant people at mit every place
[3:16:01.520 --> 3:16:06.480]  out there would be jealous of some of these men's pedigrees yet systematically they have been
[3:16:06.480 --> 3:16:12.080]  uh annihilated destroyed assassinated whatever you want to say so now we've got multiple strains
[3:16:12.080 --> 3:16:17.360]  of genetically altered um but the cocktail of death going out to different points and globe
[3:16:17.360 --> 3:16:21.360]  and the thing in france switzerland was really critical because it tells you why the natal
[3:16:21.360 --> 3:16:27.200]  troops are going to be here too is that france right now is probably the most uh the closest
[3:16:27.200 --> 3:16:35.200]  nation in the world to having a full-fledged revolution if you introduce and another variable
[3:16:35.200 --> 3:16:40.960]  i.e. a full-blown panic with everything else that's going that may be what's down necessary to
[3:16:40.960 --> 3:16:46.800]  the scale i maintain that whatever caused those vials to explode there were not mine
[3:16:46.800 --> 3:16:53.040]  was not just simply freezing or not freezing uh something that was uh compressed and expanding
[3:16:53.040 --> 3:16:59.520]  i believe that there must have been some form of a time detonation or some form of explosive
[3:16:59.520 --> 3:17:04.640]  device to set that off now you and i will never know the truth on that but think about it if
[3:17:04.640 --> 3:17:09.280]  you're going to destabilize the world you're going to destabilize it in the full sense of
[3:17:09.280 --> 3:17:14.880]  word order out of chaos we quoted in latin tex marz has written about it you and i quoted on
[3:17:14.880 --> 3:17:20.240]  all the things we talk about yet we're seeing it right now the chaos isn't even here yet yet
[3:17:20.240 --> 3:17:24.320]  governor perry as you said just declared what a national health emergency or a state health
[3:17:24.320 --> 3:17:29.440]  emergency governor schwarzenegger a couple days ago in california i would say this that we're
[3:17:29.440 --> 3:17:35.680]  going to have to first see multiple deaths in different states in the united states other than
[3:17:36.480 --> 3:17:42.320]  the hispanic or latino community to convince me that uh this thing is a full-scale pandemic i
[3:17:42.320 --> 3:17:48.160]  believe this is the presentation of pandemic and that they are simply trying to use this
[3:17:48.160 --> 3:17:54.160]  to scare everybody this is what henry kissinger was talking about the world needed if you will
[3:17:54.160 --> 3:17:59.200]  uh a problem that they had to rally together and by rallying together they can get rid of
[3:17:59.200 --> 3:18:03.840]  all nationalism and patriotism in the whole world you remember a statement you quote and now know
[3:18:03.840 --> 3:18:08.560]  exactly and now nobody really in the mainstream media is talking about the economy just shrunk
[3:18:08.560 --> 3:18:14.160]  again the last quarter by six point one percent that's total depression level massive unemployment
[3:18:14.160 --> 3:18:19.440]  obama is not going after bush for the torture uh that was coming to a head none of this is
[3:18:19.440 --> 3:18:24.480]  being discussed it's all flu flu flu flu flu and then every scientist every virologist every
[3:18:24.480 --> 3:18:30.720]  doctor i have on an even mainstream they admit this thing looks like it was manufactured and then
[3:18:30.720 --> 3:18:35.200]  if it's not killing a bunch of people what is all the hype what is all the fear they're using this
[3:18:35.200 --> 3:18:41.760]  as a cover story the question is will it mutate into something worse or what is going to be
[3:18:41.760 --> 3:18:47.520]  in these vaccines and then there's the calls to joys riley and the confirmed mass graves and the
[3:18:47.520 --> 3:18:53.920]  confirmed counties being called and managers in illinois and indiana and texas and new york can
[3:18:53.920 --> 3:18:58.880]  you have mass graves i've got the documents are you ready for a flu pandemic they've been priming
[3:18:58.880 --> 3:19:04.240]  the locals that this is going to happen and having drills the last few months at never before seen
[3:19:04.240 --> 3:19:11.680]  levels right up to this point that's why i was saying they may launch some kind of flu uh i mean
[3:19:12.320 --> 3:19:18.000]  just in my gut steve this is tied i think to the big one in some way does that mean an economic
[3:19:18.000 --> 3:19:24.240]  collapse a nuke out of left field an attack on iran an attack on pakistan they've got cia
[3:19:24.240 --> 3:19:30.400]  former section chiefs head of counterterrorism on fox saying al qaeda has a nuke out of pakistan
[3:19:30.400 --> 3:19:36.800]  and giving no evidence or no sources i mean are you i mean just in my gut and then intellectually
[3:19:36.800 --> 3:19:42.480]  all the evidence it's like they're moving in high gear all of this acceleration of tyranny was just
[3:19:42.480 --> 3:19:48.880]  the preparation now everything's going from light speed to warp speed to warp two warp three warp four
[3:19:48.880 --> 3:19:53.600]  right up to you know warp warp nine here we'll talk to steve quill when we get back some of your

[3:24:09.760 --> 3:24:17.760]  they're saying that there's two probable deaths of this new flu in california this continues
[3:24:17.760 --> 3:24:24.080]  they're just going to completely declare martial law that now to explain it's not fully implemented
[3:24:24.080 --> 3:24:30.160]  but the state of martial law has been activated now will they implement all the facets of that
[3:24:30.160 --> 3:24:34.320]  and again it's an ap and Reuters that the un is commanding and directing the forces
[3:24:35.280 --> 3:24:40.320]  just just incredible this is the type of smoke screen they need to carry out their operations
[3:24:40.320 --> 3:24:47.280]  your calls are coming up in the next segment the public is really getting concerned and scared
[3:24:48.320 --> 3:24:53.600]  steve and we're now hearing that they're going to soon have a special vaccine for all of us
[3:24:55.040 --> 3:25:00.480]  i mean this is just ridiculous well it's too ridiculous to alex because baxter was developing
[3:25:00.480 --> 3:25:06.080]  you know the slime blue vaccine we talked on it the other night obviously they sent it to 18 nations
[3:25:06.080 --> 3:25:10.160]  it was in fact did come on you got a deal in such a sterile environment i mean you're talking
[3:25:10.160 --> 3:25:15.440]  you know bsl bio safety level three at least with that stuff and i think it's important to
[3:25:15.440 --> 3:25:19.520]  understand this lady and gentlemen the fact that time magazine has already prepped americans for
[3:25:19.520 --> 3:25:24.960]  mandatory vaccinations i had a time thinking of the lead time it takes this whole thing is a
[3:25:24.960 --> 3:25:30.240]  setup and here's the thing alex if anybody's going to have any place i'm really concerned
[3:25:30.240 --> 3:25:34.160]  about tomorrow night i said that on coast to coast i said it on your show tomorrow night is
[3:25:34.160 --> 3:25:41.280]  waltz purge is not or waltz purge is night then mayday and the fact of obama's aircraft flying
[3:25:41.280 --> 3:25:48.320]  over new york at this time given the flu fear you've got to ask what kind of a symbol was it
[3:25:48.320 --> 3:25:53.920]  have you given much thought to that and by the way monday you said here uh i think it was on
[3:25:53.920 --> 3:25:58.080]  coast to coast but i remember you said it on record that there was no way they didn't know
[3:25:58.080 --> 3:26:03.120]  that that would cause a panic that it was done on purpose and then they even with a double meaning
[3:26:03.120 --> 3:26:08.560]  publicly admit it it's now public they admit the fbi didn't like it the police didn't like it they
[3:26:08.560 --> 3:26:14.080]  said don't tell the mayor don't tell the locals we're going to do this for a photo op and they
[3:26:14.080 --> 3:26:19.440]  said well what's the photo op they said you saw it and then obama laughed about it on tv like it
[3:26:19.440 --> 3:26:27.600]  was a big joke they admit they did this to terrorize people to bring back the fears of 9 11 to the
[3:26:27.600 --> 3:26:31.520]  occultist believe and you think this is kooky folks even if you don't believe in spirituality
[3:26:31.520 --> 3:26:37.360]  that globalists do they believe they have to tell you what they're going to do beforehand so i guess
[3:26:37.360 --> 3:26:43.280]  they're letting us know 9 11 was the white house 9 11 is the new world order 9 11 is us and you're
[3:26:43.280 --> 3:26:48.640]  about to see a new 9 11 is that what you're saying the symbolism is absolutely and even at a deeper
[3:26:48.640 --> 3:26:55.920]  level before you take down a person in some religious belief systems especially asian ones
[3:26:55.920 --> 3:27:02.160]  the thing is is that you've got to realize that the in order to basically capture their essence
[3:27:02.160 --> 3:27:05.600]  now ladies and gentlemen i don't believe this is a bible believing christian either does alex
[3:27:05.600 --> 3:27:11.200]  but these people believe this so the fact that someone would laugh at new yorkers who live with
[3:27:11.200 --> 3:27:16.800]  the pain of our last ones this to me is in the word of what i would call supernatural demonic
[3:27:16.800 --> 3:27:22.720]  mischief okay and remember when before the president ran he he pulled a bunch of callous
[3:27:22.720 --> 3:27:27.360]  men's alex out of his pocket one of them is hanuman the the hindu monkey god you know
[3:27:27.920 --> 3:27:34.000]  hanuman h-a-n-u-m-a-n the mischief now here's what people have got to understand there is a
[3:27:34.480 --> 3:27:42.480]  symbolism that has been telegraphed to the world every time 13 people die in new zealand or 13
[3:27:42.480 --> 3:27:48.800]  people die here whatever the number is that that these these entities from hell focus on
[3:27:48.800 --> 3:27:56.000]  d-o-h's they absolutely are sending a message around the world that it's happening now there
[3:27:56.000 --> 3:28:02.560]  is no pulling back from this one there may be a little bit of a on app just for um i would say
[3:28:02.560 --> 3:28:09.840]  two to three days but the thing that's happening is that if mexico continues to truly face the
[3:28:09.840 --> 3:28:14.720]  losses that you and i are being told off record i understand that you've had people call you
[3:28:14.720 --> 3:28:21.600]  doctors everything alex then their economy will collapse and if their economy collapses then within
[3:28:21.600 --> 3:28:27.360]  several weeks our economy collapses i'm saying this i'm saying this it is the coordinated collapse
[3:28:27.360 --> 3:28:33.200]  the coordinated fear that is being manufactured throughout the world that is going to bring
[3:28:33.200 --> 3:28:39.520]  people into compliance of all the economies of the world um north korea is even more stable
[3:28:39.520 --> 3:28:43.920]  though they're unstable comparatively to other nations north korea is more stable than mexico
[3:28:43.920 --> 3:28:48.880]  the state department has been saying mexico is admitted they are the most unstable prone to
[3:28:48.880 --> 3:28:55.920]  collapse any day going into the summer and then perfect timing to make it collapse preemptively
[3:28:55.920 --> 3:29:01.520]  so they can bring in the control and make sure the global is staying power down there so a control
[3:29:01.520 --> 3:29:07.200]  destruction so they're in charge of the destruction uh the more i've analyzed it the more i've
[3:29:07.200 --> 3:29:11.840]  dwelled on it and and and thought about it i see that's what's happening and and as the spp
[3:29:11.840 --> 3:29:17.360]  documents state north american union documents they said they would use a flu or smallpox pandemic
[3:29:17.360 --> 3:29:25.360]  to bring in uh a a a centralized regional government in the name of dealing with the crisis

[3:34:07.600 --> 3:34:12.800]  that we know of here in the u.s that's total hype it's a psi op to sell vaccines and with their
[3:34:12.800 --> 3:34:21.520]  history of what they put in vaccines woe unto he that takes it these are eugenicists and they're
[3:34:21.520 --> 3:34:26.400]  using it to train us to hear about troops on the streets lockdown of cities marshal law time magazine
[3:34:26.400 --> 3:34:31.280]  newsweek or both writing articles we got them posted at info wars dot com prism planet dot com
[3:34:31.280 --> 3:34:36.720]  saying look force inoculations coming do what the government says if this continues it's going to
[3:34:36.720 --> 3:34:41.840]  happen they're introducing they're acclimating they're baptizing you in this tyranny while leaving
[3:34:41.840 --> 3:34:48.800]  the borders wide open so that is the their agenda we know right now we're hoping this doesn't mutate
[3:34:48.800 --> 3:34:52.800]  or that they've covered up how many it's really killing a lot of people have flu like symptoms
[3:34:52.800 --> 3:34:58.640]  here in austin texas and it's not psychosomatic or placebo they're not you know it's not psychological
[3:34:58.640 --> 3:35:04.560]  they're not imagining it they're not hypochondriacs you know they're sick quite a few people that i
[3:35:04.560 --> 3:35:10.480]  know in my office have sick family or sick friends or sick band mates and uh it's to the point of
[3:35:10.480 --> 3:35:18.960]  my children are already homeschooled but i mean i don't like getting into the fear it is a precaution
[3:35:18.960 --> 3:35:26.400]  but i know that even then trying to do that feeds into it all the biggest issue here is is remember
[3:35:26.400 --> 3:35:30.720]  who the globalist star and what they've done in the past and go from there but we can't forget
[3:35:30.720 --> 3:35:36.160]  they've got a treaty to ban reloading register gun owners to register any changes you make to a
[3:35:36.160 --> 3:35:40.800]  firearm like putting a new barrel in or having something fixed at a gunsmith just incredible

[3:37:28.640 --> 3:37:32.720]  thank you alex and one of the books that was the most telling and prescient was a breed no evil
[3:37:32.720 --> 3:37:38.400]  because i had made the statement on national talk radio prior to the aum shin rikio release of
[3:37:38.400 --> 3:37:44.400]  sarin nerve gas in the tokyo subway that within two weeks or be a biological or chemical event
[3:37:44.400 --> 3:37:49.440]  and that kind of launched me into the world of uh maybe some people should pay attention to what
[3:37:49.440 --> 3:37:54.400]  i have to say over the years i've developed a lot of sources interviewed a lot of different people
[3:37:54.400 --> 3:38:01.600]  across the spectrum from scientists russian spies weapons trading specialists people that
[3:38:01.600 --> 3:38:07.840]  most people read about novels but don't know they exist in reality uh double agents uh both for
[3:38:07.840 --> 3:38:12.880]  russia and the us and that the common denominator alex and all this stuff was how stupid can the
[3:38:12.880 --> 3:38:17.520]  american people be it's not one it's enough to hear it from a russian it's another thing to hear
[3:38:17.520 --> 3:38:23.120]  it from your own uh supposed number one top spy during the cold war and you you see what's gone
[3:38:23.120 --> 3:38:27.600]  on and i can i share something with you the even the russian the old-time spies this was given to
[3:38:27.600 --> 3:38:34.240]  me about 24 hours ago are laughing at the at this administration they're actually telling our old
[3:38:34.240 --> 3:38:39.840]  time spies it's too easy it's not any fun anymore in other words the national security of the united
[3:38:39.840 --> 3:38:45.280]  states is a total joke and fiasco there's a total war going on and i dealt with these types of issues
[3:38:45.280 --> 3:38:51.440]  in the book i wrote breathe no evil which holly my webmaster dolly dale jomey i printed that or
[3:38:51.440 --> 3:38:56.480]  you know had it published in 1996 at that time no publisher would take it they said it was crazy
[3:38:56.480 --> 3:39:02.000]  no one was interested in i said you mark my words this will be the uh topic of the day
[3:39:02.000 --> 3:39:06.480]  and it will be so important that you guys will say in retrospectively wish you would have
[3:39:06.480 --> 3:39:11.360]  uh dealt with it then in fact her words gave you credit for being probably the first person
[3:39:11.360 --> 3:39:15.760]  other than himself to really detail what's happening yes and the thing that's interesting
[3:39:15.760 --> 3:39:21.920]  about that is then you know the hot zone came out uh then uh the coming plague by lori garrett
[3:39:21.920 --> 3:39:26.160]  and all those things but see again what we're doing we're trying to share this you know i figured

[3:41:25.760 --> 3:41:32.240]  forces under command the u.s david marine port team is being joined by uh in the area uh
[3:41:32.240 --> 3:41:38.400]  the area from uh many countries throughout the uh my region so it's a really historic event for us
[3:41:38.400 --> 3:41:42.320]  i think personally i think it's been a long time coming it's important because it demonstrates
[3:41:42.320 --> 3:41:47.680]  the importance of the relationships between our countries and how important it is for us to
[3:41:47.680 --> 3:41:53.280]  continue to work together i think it's demonstration basically we had marine corps uh us marine corps
[3:41:53.280 --> 3:41:58.800]  we had partner nation marine corps uh coming above uh off the us's ashen and us has messed up already
[3:41:58.800 --> 3:42:04.640]  to do what we call an eponymous demonstration uh as you noticed there was various uh landing craft
[3:42:04.640 --> 3:42:14.720]  elk hacks and aavs as well as the osprey and uh ch46 helicopters and it's a 16 helicopters coming
[3:42:14.720 --> 3:42:19.840]  in a synchronized demonstration of a landing force and it was not just the us marine landing
[3:42:19.840 --> 3:42:24.960]  force it was a joint landing force of us marine corps and partner nation folks how many partner
[3:42:24.960 --> 3:42:32.160]  nations we have uh 11 partner nation um and not including us us 12 total nations and participating
[3:42:32.160 --> 3:42:38.080]  in unitas gold how do you think the people on the beach enjoyed it i think with all the cheers i
[3:42:38.080 --> 3:42:42.800]  heard afterwards uh they enjoyed it i don't know if they were totally expected everything especially
[3:42:42.800 --> 3:42:48.400]  the marine corps the um all the marine corps uh people coming out of the aavs with guns drawn and
[3:42:48.400 --> 3:42:54.320]  and uh uh doing a landing Mexican flag you gotta kick out of America what do you think of the attack
[3:42:54.880 --> 3:43:02.000]  look at that those those um all those tanks are like one and me so like you're seeing anything
[3:43:02.000 --> 3:43:08.320]  like it before yes yes goodbye daybook career but i gotta tell you this was well done
[3:43:11.040 --> 3:43:16.560]  there it is i saw it in oakland and the marines were with foreign troops trained to take our guns
[3:43:16.560 --> 3:43:21.520]  it's called police state 2000 and people were so shocked in 99 when i released that they thought i
[3:43:21.520 --> 3:43:27.840]  hired hovercraft marines tanks and there were thousands of them imagine if the if if the public
[3:43:27.840 --> 3:43:32.400]  there saw the gun confiscation drills they do now listen this is all done to acclimate they admit
[3:43:32.400 --> 3:43:36.240]  they're preparing to use foreign troops they've signed official deals with the canadiens and
[3:43:36.240 --> 3:43:40.480]  mexicans remember in katrina they brought in mexican troops and it's the first time since the
[3:43:40.480 --> 3:43:48.000]  1860s mexican troops coming back into texas with huge flags this is all part of conditioning
[3:43:48.000 --> 3:43:54.160]  this is all part of acclimating the public and i said six nations see memory fails it was 12 excuse
[3:43:54.160 --> 3:43:59.120]  me worse than what i was saying from memory watching that last night steve quayle well i
[3:43:59.120 --> 3:44:04.320]  think alex this is this is absolutely in our face now and the deal is is that people better
[3:44:04.320 --> 3:44:08.560]  understand that when henry kissinger made the statement by september there'd be no private
[3:44:08.560 --> 3:44:14.080]  firearms ownership and that this is what's going down listen i want to and i want to give all you
[3:44:14.080 --> 3:44:20.160]  guys an austin a heads up to because austin has as you know so many retired military and a lot of
[3:44:20.160 --> 3:44:25.760]  the old guys that still love the country when i say old i don't put that in a uh anything outside
[3:44:25.760 --> 3:44:32.080]  of respect but i would say this that uh groups in austin that have been at war with other groups
[3:44:32.080 --> 3:44:38.160]  should take notice that there are indications that your area is going to get hit i'm not i
[3:44:38.160 --> 3:44:42.720]  i'm not trying to be vague or or melodramatic but just beware of that because the new world
[3:44:42.720 --> 3:44:48.160]  order people they show no mercy obviously that's an attribute of god and their god satan doesn't
[3:44:48.160 --> 3:44:54.320]  show any of that so the point is that that it's going to be very very critical seriously that
[3:44:54.320 --> 3:44:59.360]  that people who are retired military in the special forces special operations community
[3:44:59.360 --> 3:45:04.160]  uh the people that have been green berets everybody take note of this you know alex when i
[3:45:04.160 --> 3:45:09.520]  gave the orange alert it was only days and i'm not just saying that it was days because of my
[3:45:09.520 --> 3:45:15.600]  orange alert but when people are dispatched to go and gps uh everybody that attends the tea
[3:45:15.600 --> 3:45:19.120]  parties and they're using facial recognition software you and i talked about that goes up
[3:45:19.120 --> 3:45:25.200]  satellite and within one hour one hour someone's dispatched in many cases that can never you know
[3:45:25.200 --> 3:45:31.120]  that type of effectiveness never exists in a federal organization it has to be higher up
[3:45:31.120 --> 3:45:35.040]  someone's controlling it who is a military background and i think you and i both know
[3:45:35.040 --> 3:45:39.280]  who's controlling quote the census takers are not census takers ladies and gentlemen
[3:45:39.280 --> 3:45:45.040]  they're just double verifying uh who lives where when these people that alex and i were
[3:45:45.040 --> 3:45:49.520]  talking about he just played the clip these are the people that are coming i have four star general
[3:45:49.520 --> 3:45:54.320]  no no they admit in that fema report and the and the dhs report the one that got all the attention
[3:45:54.320 --> 3:45:58.720]  we've got we just got another fbi one who it's really wild we're gonna have that tomorrow
[3:45:58.720 --> 3:46:02.640]  and copies are already outside the office you can't stop it getting up we've got it ready to load
[3:46:02.640 --> 3:46:10.960]  right now we're just going to do a report tomorrow um they are in those reports talking about how they
[3:46:10.960 --> 3:46:17.120]  have intelligence on the gun owners they admit in the in the secret reports that mention the more
[3:46:17.120 --> 3:46:22.960]  classified reports that they're surveilling gun owners christians ron paul supporters libertarians
[3:46:22.960 --> 3:46:30.320]  and veterans and that we and that homeland security is for us it's astonishing and then
[3:46:30.320 --> 3:46:34.960]  again let me finish up one thought i've gotten challenged for over 10 years the amount of people
[3:46:34.960 --> 3:46:38.400]  in this country nato troops that have been bivouac placed in all the bases at george
[3:46:38.400 --> 3:46:46.160]  boy senior closed down my number from multi-star generals across the board and spies on both sides
[3:46:46.160 --> 3:46:52.000]  of the former iron curtain 345 000 so just because ladies and gentlemen you don't see them
[3:46:52.000 --> 3:46:56.880]  look these people are professionals are a lot of bases any military base that was closed down worth
[3:46:56.880 --> 3:47:01.840]  its fault had extensive underground facilities to prepare for nuclear war doing and and well most
[3:47:01.840 --> 3:47:06.800]  of these people have jobs we've confirmed uh in intelligence where they'll be working at a pizza
[3:47:06.800 --> 3:47:12.400]  place a factory uh and they're pre-placed uh you know stay behind teams uh but instead of a
[3:47:12.400 --> 3:47:17.120]  stay behind team they've always been here and they work for the un let's take calls let's talk to
[3:47:17.120 --> 3:47:24.800]  pedro in mexico pedro what can you tell us about what's happening down there hi alex hi everybody
[3:47:24.800 --> 3:47:30.320]  good thanks for calling it though it's uh a million people it's a million people town it's
[3:47:30.320 --> 3:47:34.800]  about a hundred miles north of mexico city okay say the name again because i was cutting you off
[3:47:34.800 --> 3:47:42.320]  you're from where it's caretaro okay there's a delay okay tell us what you're seeing sir
[3:47:42.320 --> 3:47:50.000]  okay well i see people in the streets like about 10 to 20 percent of the people where the surgical
[3:47:51.440 --> 3:47:57.440]  and basically they've created a lot of hysteria of what they show on the mainstream tv here i have
[3:47:57.440 --> 3:48:02.880]  no any lack of food in the supermarkets i hear that pharmacies have reported a 15 percent increase
[3:48:02.880 --> 3:48:08.480]  in sales of course tourism restaurants coffee shops are dead and this is going to be terrible
[3:48:08.480 --> 3:48:14.800]  for the economy thanks for this flu now central banks can keep printing money and this swine flu
[3:48:14.800 --> 3:48:17.920]  will postpone higher prices of goods and services at least for a few months
[3:48:19.280 --> 3:48:23.520]  um as far as i'm concerned mexico's economy was struggling along i think it was holding better
[3:48:23.520 --> 3:48:28.000]  than in the u.s but even with the higher taxation measures that the the latest the
[3:48:28.960 --> 3:48:31.520]  mexican iris implement in the last 12 months
[3:48:34.160 --> 3:48:37.440]  that's right i've read they want to squeeze more taxes out of people it says the mexican
[3:48:37.440 --> 3:48:43.360]  government's going to start taking s dr's that's the new global currency from the imf and i guess
[3:48:43.360 --> 3:48:50.320]  they got to then squeeze it out of you four folks yeah every every year they put new measures
[3:48:50.320 --> 3:48:55.840]  they make it you know harder to to not pay taxes or every time they they force us to pay more
[3:48:55.840 --> 3:48:59.600]  however there was a very interesting article this morning and uh yesterday evening in the
[3:48:59.600 --> 3:49:05.200]  reforma newspaper which is uh one of the mainstream newspapers in mexico city where
[3:49:05.200 --> 3:49:11.520]  they courted the secretary of health saying that only 26 cases of flu have been absolutely
[3:49:11.520 --> 3:49:17.440]  confirmed to be related to the swine flu and only seven deaths have been absolutely confirmed
[3:49:17.440 --> 3:49:25.600]  he said that they have a total of 2400 they have a total of 2498 cases of a typical pneumonia
[3:49:25.600 --> 3:49:32.000]  of which 159 have resulted in deaths these are 159 deaths are the ones that cnn is reporting
[3:49:32.000 --> 3:49:40.800]  yes yes absolutely how many people go ahead i don't know how many people have uh you know
[3:49:40.800 --> 3:49:46.000]  been to these poor hospitals in mexico but i can tell you i mean these they're very humble and
[3:49:46.000 --> 3:49:50.400]  simple and they have no way to know what virus is killing them i mean all they know is that these
[3:49:50.400 --> 3:49:54.320]  people are dying from a pneumonia and every all the doctors you know they start hearing
[3:49:54.320 --> 3:50:02.320]  all the swine flu so they must attribute these a typical uh pneumonia cases to this uh swine flu
[3:50:02.320 --> 3:50:10.800]  virus and now they want to use another point that i've noticed go ahead okay the other point
[3:50:10.800 --> 3:50:16.960]  i've noticed is i've been following ken trails in mexico since may 1997 in fact when i started
[3:50:16.960 --> 3:50:21.920]  seeing them nobody knew what they were here i had seen pictures of the ken trails in the us
[3:50:21.920 --> 3:50:28.640]  and uh i i think i was one of the first websites that were placed uh regarding ken trails and so
[3:50:28.640 --> 3:50:34.320]  i've been very you know tracking them ever since and one of the things i've noticed is that in the
[3:50:34.320 --> 3:50:40.560]  last 90 days approximately the ken trail spraying at least in a hundred mile radius of where i'm
[3:50:40.560 --> 3:50:47.120]  located has been just two or three hundred percent uh you know harder i mean i got friends
[3:50:47.120 --> 3:50:50.720]  with little kids enough and i'm talking about people that are not poor i mean i'm talking about
[3:50:50.720 --> 3:50:55.520]  people that at least have you know resources that will equal the average you know a middle
[3:50:55.520 --> 3:50:59.200]  class american you know private health care stay there stay there i want to hear more we

[3:57:45.840 --> 3:57:50.480]  a typical if you want because of the timing of the year but probably because of these

[4:00:45.360 --> 4:00:50.240]  website is the info warrior dot com and you can check that out of the subsidiary of info wars
[4:00:50.240 --> 4:00:58.400]  dot com in the info war all right i want to go to a baby of phone calls for folks that we're holding
[4:00:58.400 --> 4:01:02.960]  on the other phone system with genesis and then let steve get out of here before we break this news
[4:01:02.960 --> 4:01:08.160]  with jason bermas steve quail the kim trail increasing now you have the government admitting
[4:01:08.160 --> 4:01:14.000]  they're terraforming the atmosphere for your own good exactly as we said baryon salts aluminum dioxide
[4:01:14.000 --> 4:01:18.560]  saying quote these pollutants will help cool the earth but the studies show it's actually heating
[4:01:18.560 --> 4:01:24.400]  them uh you have a massive increase of kim trails worldwide they're coming out with everything how
[4:01:24.400 --> 4:01:29.280]  do the kim trails that you pioneered exposing back in the mid 90s how does that feed into all this
[4:01:29.920 --> 4:01:35.840]  well uh there's multiple levels of this but it's probably the largest genetic engineering experiment
[4:01:35.840 --> 4:01:42.320]  alex down in a worldwide basis that has ever been concocted because not only are they just
[4:01:42.320 --> 4:01:47.520]  spraying the baryon and aluminum salts and the variations etc for the original reasons supposedly
[4:01:47.520 --> 4:01:52.880]  to deflect the solar radiation back in the upper atmosphere the real thing was actually not only
[4:01:52.880 --> 4:02:00.240]  terraforming but changing the genetic structure of the food we eat look all the cows all the sheep
[4:02:00.240 --> 4:02:06.720]  everything is out in the form of livestock in the form of everything plants and us too and see
[4:02:06.720 --> 4:02:12.640]  the thing is and i say that that we are what we eat and this is what most people can't put together
[4:02:12.640 --> 4:02:18.720]  they are absolutely testing various strains in various places it's just like the old dustin
[4:02:18.720 --> 4:02:23.440]  hopman movie outbreak and by the way that really happened the opening scene with the african village
[4:02:23.440 --> 4:02:29.120]  ebola uh i was on with george dory when i said look when at the last time i did a ebola story
[4:02:29.120 --> 4:02:33.440]  in the ebola by year i said the u.s military or some of the intelligence agency gotta get
[4:02:33.440 --> 4:02:37.440]  somebody down there because you're going to be guys flying in in helicopters and taking samples
[4:02:37.440 --> 4:02:42.880]  guess what they didn't take my uh admonition seriously and within hours after i said that
[4:02:42.880 --> 4:02:47.200]  sure enough the helicopters went there they were life-culturing ebola now here's the deal
[4:02:47.200 --> 4:02:52.560]  what we're trying to get across is the fact that this is the implementation stage of the new world
[4:02:52.560 --> 4:02:56.240]  order everything alex has warned about everything he's moved his bait it's movies about everything i
[4:02:56.240 --> 4:03:01.920]  have written about is this time see alex there's no more time for warning what we're doing now
[4:03:01.920 --> 4:03:06.800]  is chronicling the implementation i mean they're openly i mean you're right they're openly announcing
[4:03:06.800 --> 4:03:10.560]  the world government they're openly announcing the bank of the world they're openly announcing the
[4:03:10.560 --> 4:03:15.120]  bankruptcy of the planet they're openly announcing the u n is in control of the major governments
[4:03:15.120 --> 4:03:21.040]  for your own good they're openly saying a world authority openly saying one child policies openly
[4:03:21.040 --> 4:03:26.000]  saying humans are bad but they're so concerned about our health take this shot go ahead well
[4:03:26.000 --> 4:03:32.160]  again the thing is is that everything everything everything is lining up so uh what is going to
[4:03:32.160 --> 4:03:38.400]  be broken on that u n documents that listen what people have got to finally recognize this is
[4:03:38.400 --> 4:03:43.120]  is that everything they've known is being taken away from it doesn't matter if it's a 401k turning
[4:03:43.120 --> 4:03:48.960]  into a 201k turning to 101k whatever it's going to their hope for their future their children's
[4:03:48.960 --> 4:03:55.120]  future their grandchildren's future and at this point there are no political solutions the only
[4:03:55.120 --> 4:04:00.800]  solution is quite candidly is that enough people can get warned and can get prepared
[4:04:00.800 --> 4:04:05.280]  to try and escape these devils because like one person just sent me an email calling it the builder
[4:04:05.280 --> 4:04:11.440]  burger flu let's call it the builder burger brew because again ladies and gentlemen there's nothing
[4:04:11.440 --> 4:04:16.160]  that we're telling you that hasn't already been laid out scripted out and and put into
[4:04:16.160 --> 4:04:21.520]  implementation remember the vice president biden statement about the first six months of uh the
[4:04:21.520 --> 4:04:26.000]  new administration that president obama was going to be challenged well i got news for you alex that's
[4:04:26.000 --> 4:04:31.120]  almost to the day isn't it yeah well they're acting like his first hundred days are like
[4:04:31.120 --> 4:04:36.720]  that he saved the earth and he was george washington and and jesus and everybody wrapped
[4:04:36.720 --> 4:04:41.360]  into one i mean it's just amazing worship of this guy right were you surprised were you surprised
[4:04:41.360 --> 4:04:47.760]  by the image i think you put it up on obama and uh you know as jesus with the crown of thorns on
[4:04:47.760 --> 4:04:52.320]  his head and stuff yes and that way and the city of new york has hung that up publicly
[4:04:52.320 --> 4:05:00.240]  with him and jesus with that sickening fake smile i mean this is just over the top like north korea
[4:05:00.240 --> 4:05:05.200]  or something the worship of this guy let's take a call let's talk to randy in canada randy you're
[4:05:05.200 --> 4:05:12.080]  on there with steve quayle go ahead hey man how's it going today good go ahead sir um now i'm
[4:05:12.080 --> 4:05:18.960]  just reporting from canada here uh this one blue thing you see it on the news and all this shit
[4:05:18.960 --> 4:05:23.520]  they tell us how i'm letting you go i appreciate your call take care that's uh you won't be going
[4:05:23.520 --> 4:05:31.280]  out there that's fine you guys want to do that you just get cut off okay um now yeah we have
[4:05:31.280 --> 4:05:35.840]  actually a 15 second delay we can engage but whatever doesn't matter the powers that's how
[4:05:35.840 --> 4:05:40.800]  people get knocked off the air and from now on your band we actually go ahead what i think is
[4:05:40.800 --> 4:05:46.480]  is too is and we're not now we don't know the exact time frame but when the people at that
[4:05:46.480 --> 4:05:51.520]  fort meyers beach or whatever that the landing exercise not one person questioned you know and
[4:05:51.520 --> 4:05:55.840]  i i was praying under my breath oh please let somebody go up and ask if this is a u n thing for
[4:05:55.840 --> 4:06:00.320]  the amazing united states they may have questioned they just won't show that in the newscast right
[4:06:00.320 --> 4:06:05.920]  but given the fact that now it's in your face you see i believe that obviously god gives a flashing
[4:06:05.920 --> 4:06:10.800]  neon signs and this is a flashing neon sign but i've got to get people to understand this
[4:06:10.800 --> 4:06:14.880]  very soon the shortages which have already appeared started bearing ammo
[4:06:14.880 --> 4:06:21.200]  reloading supplies some food so everything is going to be dried up and to the victors go to
[4:06:21.200 --> 4:06:27.120]  spoils when you've got four mercenary troops alex from the backside that means the deepest levels
[4:06:27.120 --> 4:06:33.360]  of real world intelligence these guys are laughing at how easy it's going to be to walk in and literally
[4:06:33.360 --> 4:06:39.600]  plunder the american citizens of everything they own and that's that that's what i'm telling you
[4:06:39.600 --> 4:06:45.760]  is so maddening to me because it's like everybody thinks listen if the paratroopers start coming
[4:06:45.760 --> 4:06:50.320]  out of the sky a machine gunny everybody below they'll think it's a rambo movie and they'll
[4:06:50.320 --> 4:06:56.080]  run out and try and get the you know 50 bucks for a stand-in part it's that controlled television
[4:06:56.080 --> 4:07:02.400]  has to go off people have got to formulate immediate plans and again for those who are in the highest
[4:07:02.400 --> 4:07:08.240]  highest target-rich environment you guys have got to take immediate immediate action like
[4:07:08.240 --> 4:07:13.440]  look when i gave that orange alert people gave me so much up stop you know that that it was just
[4:07:13.440 --> 4:07:18.080]  amazing yet i prayed and i prayed i prayed i had people who are intercessors praying
[4:07:18.080 --> 4:07:23.520]  and i couldn't get away from it you see it's again enough to warn we've done that but again
[4:07:23.520 --> 4:07:28.480]  enough warning now this is the implementation and it's happening right before every eye this
[4:07:28.480 --> 4:07:33.440]  is scripted trust me they know every step we're going to take they know every step they're going
[4:07:33.440 --> 4:07:39.600]  to take okay steve steve um i want to take a few calls here and for folks that want to call in
[4:07:39.600 --> 4:07:47.760]  specifically didn't get a chance the last hour it's 888-201-2244-888-201-2244-512
[4:07:49.120 --> 4:07:55.840]  that's 512-646-1776 we'll take three or four more calls before steve leaves us but i wanted
[4:07:55.840 --> 4:08:01.360]  jason bermas to get to this let me show people that on tv this is the huge checklist for influenza
[4:08:01.360 --> 4:08:06.560]  pandemic preparedness planning and they admit that at a level four they can start locking areas
[4:08:06.560 --> 4:08:11.840]  down quarantining getting the force inoculations ready level five that all begins we covered that
[4:08:11.840 --> 4:08:17.600]  with dr sherry tenpenny yesterday and the bermas has been reading over the epidemic alert and
[4:08:17.600 --> 4:08:22.160]  response world health organization department of communicable diseases surveillance and response
[4:08:22.160 --> 4:08:30.240]  global influenza program of the united nations in association with the cdc cds csr and the gip
[4:08:30.880 --> 4:08:35.600]  go ahead and go over those key areas and get steve quill's take on that jason sure i mean
[4:08:36.320 --> 4:08:42.080]  section 1.2 for instance is the command and control section where they ask who is really in
[4:08:42.080 --> 4:08:45.760]  charge i gotta stop you by the way for weird listeners that send emails saying don't interrupt
[4:08:45.760 --> 4:08:50.400]  we interrupt here for key breaking news you guys are just neurotic out there this is huge
[4:08:50.400 --> 4:08:55.920]  breaking news get it up on screen i want to play a clip of this right now swine alert level up to
[4:08:55.920 --> 4:09:01.840]  the second highest it goes from one to six they were at four saying they go to five five can be
[4:09:01.840 --> 4:09:08.640]  forced inoculations roundups arrest military checkpoints that's in ap reuters official announcements
[4:09:08.640 --> 4:09:14.640]  level six is open total martial law you're basically shot if you leave your house suspension of all
[4:09:14.640 --> 4:09:19.680]  freedoms and they're doing this in the name of a flu that's only killed a few people they're not
[4:09:19.680 --> 4:09:25.600]  saying nine people in mexico the others died of other stuff just unbelievable breaking news
[4:09:26.160 --> 4:09:31.120]  it's a phase five alert is a strong signal that a pandemic is imminent it is called when there is
[4:09:31.120 --> 4:09:36.080]  a human to human spread of the virus in at least two countries in one region so far 150 people are
[4:09:36.080 --> 4:09:41.760]  thought to have died from the h1n1 mexico saying that's not true all but one deaths have been in
[4:09:41.760 --> 4:09:46.720]  mexico a mexican toddler visiting united states was the first death in america the virus has spread
[4:09:46.720 --> 4:09:52.720]  to nine countries and may have infected more than 2500 people sources of the level will be raised
[4:09:52.720 --> 4:09:57.760]  from four to five print that article for me asap okay i want to get steve quills take on this
[4:09:57.760 --> 4:10:01.840]  environments then you can get into the un saying what they're going to do go ahead steve well right
[4:10:01.840 --> 4:10:06.560]  now as we're on the air this is breaking news uh a lot of the people that monitor the different
[4:10:06.560 --> 4:10:10.560]  traffic these are from military intelligence former intelligence guys i'm getting an email
[4:10:11.200 --> 4:10:15.520]  steve warn everybody i'm picking up activity on the army national guard frequencies also hearing
[4:10:15.520 --> 4:10:21.680]  helicopters being put on standby also unusual red cross activity on bhf low ban i will advise you
[4:10:21.680 --> 4:10:28.000]  as i sort this out let me share this with you alex a hundred percent no melodrama this guy just
[4:10:28.000 --> 4:10:35.120]  calls it like he sees it so the point being is that with uh jason's documentation it is already
[4:10:35.120 --> 4:10:40.720]  being implemented i don't know if that means we have two days or two weeks but again i want to
[4:10:40.720 --> 4:10:46.000]  make this plea anybody who is going to leave their current location have better consider doing it
[4:10:46.000 --> 4:10:49.920]  they've got nothing but an extended vacation if we're wrong they won't be able to get to where
[4:10:49.920 --> 4:10:54.640]  they're going if we're right people in new york you need to probably because because if they got
[4:10:54.640 --> 4:10:59.680]  a level five can lock down old cities a level six just means it's guaranteed absolutely that's what
[4:10:59.680 --> 4:11:04.480]  i'm trying to say and i gotta tell you i'm surrounded by people that will all think about leaving
[4:11:04.480 --> 4:11:10.960]  when i see it in the roadblocks is that you'll be dead i'm serious alex this is this is so in your
[4:11:10.960 --> 4:11:17.840]  face this is so these people do not care builder burger flew adept brew all the antecedents that
[4:11:17.840 --> 4:11:23.360]  are the precedents and everything that has followed that have gone on hey steve did you
[4:11:23.360 --> 4:11:28.000]  call coast to coast to get us on the other day or did they call you they called us yeah they called
[4:11:28.000 --> 4:11:33.520]  me and i did maybe we should call them and say that we need to have an update tonight in the first
[4:11:33.520 --> 4:11:39.280]  hour because going to this level five is a big big deal and george is a smart guy but i'm not
[4:11:39.280 --> 4:11:43.680]  sure they're gonna understand the full import of this well here's the deal alex i'll talk to
[4:11:43.680 --> 4:11:48.960]  lisa and tell her that uh you know we're both available do that but again ladies and gentlemen
[4:11:48.960 --> 4:11:55.120]  this is no dry run you would not have the documents what what's happened okay a lot of stuff has
[4:11:55.120 --> 4:11:58.880]  existed in the background it's not being brought to the foreground because you're gonna have military
[4:11:58.880 --> 4:12:04.240]  commanders u.s. military commanders rightly so challenging a lot of these orders okay and i can
[4:12:04.240 --> 4:12:11.200]  tell you this a four-star general from my best friend uh just left for another part of the world
[4:12:11.200 --> 4:12:16.400]  and he said to my friend he said you tell all the people you know keep your head down because it's
[4:12:16.400 --> 4:12:22.240]  coming apart seems and this is active duty this is not bravo seara some guy on the news worried
[4:12:22.240 --> 4:12:28.080]  about you know his pension that there are real people who are ready to basically uh defend
[4:12:28.080 --> 4:12:31.520]  their constitution take up the oath and they know what's happening and ladies and gentlemen
[4:12:31.520 --> 4:12:36.320]  whether you know it or not there is no longer a united states as you know it let me state this
[4:12:36.320 --> 4:12:43.600]  calmly okay regardless it looks like this flew as a hoax absolutely it is designer to look weird
[4:12:43.600 --> 4:12:48.400]  and and and to scare people and to spread quickly but it's mild to everybody that's getting it
[4:12:48.400 --> 4:12:52.560]  except for a very small percentage and that tends to be people who are run down they met this boy
[4:12:52.560 --> 4:12:56.640]  from mexico that died in houston we already had a bunch of medical issues i bet he's got a hemophilia
[4:12:56.640 --> 4:13:02.880]  or hiv or something okay now now that's going on user chronicle says that now but that doesn't
[4:13:02.880 --> 4:13:08.880]  matter the way over response the craziness the troops on standby all the drills and flu drills
[4:13:08.880 --> 4:13:16.160]  and martial law drills and mass grave preparations we confirmed before this that's why things are so
[4:13:16.160 --> 4:13:22.000]  and that's why my gut has been taken this since last friday and then saturday i said this something's
[4:13:22.000 --> 4:13:27.520]  going on i said i think this is a hoax flu wise but the response is real the vaccine is real
[4:13:27.520 --> 4:13:32.880]  you know my spirit you know my gut my instincts tells me something's very serious here and uh
[4:13:32.880 --> 4:13:36.720]  we're going to go to jason bermas in a moment with this other breaking news of what this means
[4:13:36.720 --> 4:13:42.240]  what the united nations is saying but let's go to a few calls a tommy dropped a lot tommy disagreed

[4:13:59.760 --> 4:14:04.080]  steve i i really want to ask you i know it's hard to do because things are in such a state of
[4:14:04.080 --> 4:14:09.920]  flux at the moment and they're actually evolving um it may not be possible for you to answer this
[4:14:09.920 --> 4:14:15.600]  this day but what do you see occurring here with what you know at this point in time over the next
[4:14:15.600 --> 4:14:20.080]  two to three weeks in this country that's going to affect every person in this country and i'll
[4:14:20.080 --> 4:14:24.480]  take my hands off their shirt certainly appreciate everything you guys that thank you thank you mark
[4:14:24.480 --> 4:14:28.400]  in origan go ahead steve quayle well i'll ask you just gave the answer that ahead of time i said i
[4:14:28.400 --> 4:14:33.280]  don't know if we've got two days or two weeks but we go to level five and god forgive we go to level
[4:14:33.280 --> 4:14:38.640]  six well they will implement martial law now the question should be more will they implement it first
[4:14:38.640 --> 4:14:42.560]  in the state that have already declared i gotta interrupt you i want to be clear they implemented
[4:14:42.560 --> 4:14:49.680]  martial law sunday that is they said we have now implemented this but they said it's a formality
[4:14:50.800 --> 4:14:56.320]  the question is will they then physically enforce it but they have declared we're under the martial
[4:14:56.320 --> 4:15:01.520]  law civil emergency if you read the corresponding executive orders as you know steve right i agree
[4:15:01.520 --> 4:15:06.560]  with that but here's what i'm saying i mean implement implement right if i hear that the
[4:15:06.560 --> 4:15:10.960]  control has gone up and others by the way it's not just the thing with me okay there are plenty
[4:15:10.960 --> 4:15:15.520]  of people they can blow the whistle if we hear that the control has gone up and they go operational
[4:15:15.520 --> 4:15:21.680]  for people to understand this the airborne command structure that will initiate the implementation
[4:15:21.680 --> 4:15:26.960]  sending troops in and the assassination teams against those who are designated targets that
[4:15:26.960 --> 4:15:32.320]  that will go up when that individual goes up and says you know gives his code and his emergency
[4:15:32.320 --> 4:15:37.120]  action message and demands total total obedience and he'll say it probably three to seven times
[4:15:37.120 --> 4:15:42.400]  where the protocol is and changes it from one word this is not an exercise this is go that's
[4:15:42.400 --> 4:15:46.640]  when the purplice and alex we were there this is what i tried to get across everybody i don't
[4:15:46.640 --> 4:15:51.360]  think that people understood this on coast to coast we were there on saturday when you were
[4:15:51.360 --> 4:15:57.040]  having your emergency broadcasting yeah now now we know they have a list of american patriots gun
[4:15:57.040 --> 4:16:02.320]  owners and people of influence that was declassified the church hearings in the 70s and we know and
[4:16:02.320 --> 4:16:06.720]  now publicly confirmed it was already documented people didn't want to believe it that the main
[4:16:06.720 --> 4:16:11.920]  threat to the terrorists that run the government homeland security is the american people gun
[4:16:11.920 --> 4:16:18.800]  owners christians business owners veterans and so this whole military apparatus of north com is
[4:16:18.800 --> 4:16:23.440]  for us because when they take america down they got to go after us you don't think they're not
[4:16:23.440 --> 4:16:27.280]  going to use the marshal law to get it in place and get everybody acclimated and then start you
[4:16:27.280 --> 4:16:33.440]  think they're going to slam it down day one i think they're going to slam it down day one from the
[4:16:33.440 --> 4:16:39.520]  time the ariel command directive is given i want people to understand this when i have a lieutenant
[4:16:39.520 --> 4:16:45.280]  colonel that works for that organization in my office who's a christian and scared to death out
[4:16:45.280 --> 4:16:50.640]  of what is being planned and i asked him what's his name i said how many he says 200 million
[4:16:50.640 --> 4:16:54.800]  well you know what that question was all about alex how many people are they prepared to take out
[4:16:54.800 --> 4:17:02.720]  well we know they we know they killed half of ukraine and 35 percent of uh 35 percent of uh
[4:17:02.720 --> 4:17:07.200]  cambodia and then they write books about it bragging i want to go back to calls in a moment
[4:17:07.200 --> 4:17:12.480]  but uh vermice i apologize for interrupting you with the level five alert i apologize listeners
[4:17:12.480 --> 4:17:16.800]  that don't like that that i interrupted with the level five alert but people need to know that uh
[4:17:16.800 --> 4:17:21.360]  you go ahead and uh read from the start the document name and what you found sure this is uh
[4:17:21.360 --> 4:17:28.160]  um the who or world health organization checklist for influenza pandemic preparedness planning and
[4:17:28.160 --> 4:17:33.600]  it's a 39 page document but some of the highlights here alex are in the command and control section
[4:17:33.600 --> 4:17:38.080]  they ask oh who's in charge is the prime minister or the president the ministry of health other
[4:17:38.080 --> 4:17:42.960]  departments regional officers we just don't know and then they tell you who's in charge right over
[4:17:42.960 --> 4:17:49.440]  here in section 1.4.2 uh to ensure that mechanisms exist for the information sharing between national
[4:17:49.440 --> 4:17:56.000]  authorities who and other united nations agencies coordinate with or use existing mechanisms set
[4:17:56.000 --> 4:18:01.440]  up in the implementation of the international health regulations so it's all international it's all
[4:18:01.440 --> 4:18:06.720]  global it's all you know it's in reuters and ap the the secretary general saying the u.s canada
[4:18:06.720 --> 4:18:11.600]  uh europe mexico are all following their directive the global government is activated and he said
[4:18:11.600 --> 4:18:15.440]  this is great for global governance this is a great test for everybody to go under our control
[4:18:15.440 --> 4:18:21.440]  yeah and then in section 1.5.1 legal and ethical issues they say during a pandemic it may be necessary
[4:18:21.440 --> 4:18:26.240]  to overrule existing legislation or individual human rights that's right folks you have no
[4:18:26.240 --> 4:18:30.720]  rights examples are the enforcement of quarantine that means you know they can take you put you
[4:18:30.720 --> 4:18:35.680]  in the camp keep you there overruling individual freedom of movement uh use of privately owned
[4:18:35.680 --> 4:18:40.000]  buildings for hospitals uh off license use of drugs in other words the drugs don't actually
[4:18:40.000 --> 4:18:43.920]  have to be good for you have to be verified they can be total poison and they can't get in trouble
[4:18:43.920 --> 4:18:49.760]  for it uh compulsory vaccination you must take the vaccination or implementation of emergency
[4:18:49.760 --> 4:18:54.640]  shifts in essential services and that's level five uh yes i believe so that's level five i've
[4:18:54.640 --> 4:18:59.600]  read their checklist you know what we've taken a lot of steve quail steve quail dot com's time

[4:20:06.880 --> 4:20:12.240]  or last monday you launched the the orange alert saying get ready for the next two weeks for the
[4:20:12.240 --> 4:20:17.680]  drop the hammer never done that before now it's just happened again uh and you're saying you're
[4:20:17.680 --> 4:20:22.960]  going to death con five you're i mean you're gonna put out a red alert my red alert then i mean that's
[4:20:22.960 --> 4:20:27.520]  saying they're guaranteed to come out for everybody uh let me say this if the message is given and
[4:20:27.520 --> 4:20:32.800]  they're going up now can somebody say well how can you make sure the internet uh stays up i can't
[4:20:32.800 --> 4:20:37.360]  but i prayed that the people that will have the time to see the red alert will take it seriously
[4:20:37.360 --> 4:20:43.040]  i'm not saying alex at this point i'm saying specifically i need one piece of information
[4:20:43.040 --> 4:20:47.760]  i have never done that in my entire life nor would i get only get one shot at it okay
[4:20:47.760 --> 4:20:55.040]  but if it's if it is implementation of martial law and the command directive is given by the aerial
[4:20:55.040 --> 4:21:00.480]  control mechanism i'll leave it vague then the point is that we're there and uh well you know what
[4:21:00.480 --> 4:21:06.480]  happened a month ago uh the the the head of cyber security obama hired quentin said it's a it's a
[4:21:06.480 --> 4:21:12.000]  takeover police take takeover the pentagon's taking over all the major internet hubs to shut it down
[4:21:12.000 --> 4:21:15.920]  and they said yes we need to be able to shut the web down to save it and the new york times
[4:21:15.920 --> 4:21:22.160]  and others so they are ready the safety is off the gun is to our head and with these globalist
[4:21:22.160 --> 4:21:27.440]  history and them certainly hyping something that shouldn't be being hyped we've got to be ready
[4:21:28.240 --> 4:21:33.440]  well and and and literally alex in your case too and i want to encourage everybody out there

[4:21:51.840 --> 4:21:56.880]  ladies and gentlemen even though these people can plan and they're ready to dispose of all of us
[4:21:56.880 --> 4:22:02.800]  my heart beat uh dispatch us as their term the point is there is a god in heaven who can act
[4:22:02.800 --> 4:22:08.240]  on behalf of intercessory prayer it's been proven time and time again and by the way alex we are
[4:22:08.240 --> 4:22:13.760]  at the darkest hour we are literally to the point where we're at a tipping point and that all right
[4:22:14.400 --> 4:22:18.480]  that's all i can say no i agree with you we've got time to take a few more calls bermus will be

[4:22:32.480 --> 4:22:36.400]  probably going to be up here so i might even be sitting in with you jason uh for those that don't
[4:22:36.400 --> 4:22:41.440]  know swine alert level up to second highest it's gone from level four to level five that sky news
[4:22:41.440 --> 4:22:45.680]  will make sure that's up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com if it isn't already up ask an
[4:22:45.680 --> 4:22:51.520]  ammo and paul to get that up immediately this is just off the charts uh for a flu that's nothing
[4:22:51.520 --> 4:22:56.160]  at least unless they're lying about what it's doing this is incredible uh let's not that it's not
[4:22:56.160 --> 4:23:02.160]  the threat alex it's a solution to the threat and the solution is what's getting the dominant uh
[4:23:02.160 --> 4:23:05.920]  amount of air coverage and not one thinking individual thing wait a minute wait a minute
[4:23:05.920 --> 4:23:09.600]  wait a minute on national media look you guys you're blowing this out of proportion coming
[4:23:09.600 --> 4:23:15.120]  people die of a year of pneumonia or whatever it's absolutely the most creative uh let's
[4:23:15.120 --> 4:23:20.880]  say this use of fear and terror by the mainstream media that i've ever seen in my life yeah it is
[4:23:20.880 --> 4:23:26.240]  it's incredible that's why even though it looks like a total hoax i'm still upset and it's
[4:23:26.240 --> 4:23:30.880]  it's because of what they're doing and it's because it's how obvious it is and if we get the word out
[4:23:30.880 --> 4:23:35.520]  what they're doing they may back off we've done this before uh and i told you we're the main
[4:23:35.520 --> 4:23:39.360]  threat we we have power that's why those of you out there were so important that's why we're the
[4:23:39.360 --> 4:23:43.920]  number one threat the secret homeland security documents they know that we know what they're
[4:23:43.920 --> 4:23:48.320]  doing they're aware that we understand their program that and that's why they hate it that
[4:23:48.320 --> 4:23:51.760]  our numbers are growing so they're and i've said they're going to turn the chessboard over
[4:23:51.760 --> 4:23:55.040]  that's what they're going to go ahead and just move right at us that's what i've been seeing in
[4:23:55.040 --> 4:24:02.480]  the cards and i'll oh man uh forest in texas you're on the air forest yes sir uh i have a question
[4:24:02.480 --> 4:24:08.160]  for for uh steven a quick question for you out okay go ahead okay this is a question for steve
[4:24:08.160 --> 4:24:14.080]  um i do believe that there could be any type of way that the that the world's scientific
[4:24:14.080 --> 4:24:18.640]  political and economic oligarchy can be convinced to turn around what they're doing and to be at one
[4:24:18.640 --> 4:24:26.720]  was like just this and what is wholesome no categorically no okay this is rough um
[4:24:28.080 --> 4:24:32.960]  do you think it would be possible if we could all have uh maybe like like half of the show or

[4:26:44.720 --> 4:26:51.440]  a video entitled border agents i travelers for signs of flu uh marie mortara reports uh and it
[4:26:51.440 --> 4:26:57.200]  says basically that the cdc has ordered the border agents to i travelers for obvious signs of flu
[4:26:57.200 --> 4:27:02.880]  and to uh send them to a cdc quarantine or a local health official if you'd like to have the video
[4:27:02.880 --> 4:27:07.520]  queued up right now i can play the report yeah will you email that 30 seconds for that email
[4:27:07.520 --> 4:27:14.000]  that sir can you hear me sir can you hear yeah uh yeah email it to erinandfallwars.com go ahead
[4:27:14.000 --> 4:27:21.680]  and play the clip okay thank you here it is folks it has been asked by the cdc to look for travelers
[4:27:21.680 --> 4:27:27.760]  with obvious flu signs now those people might be taken to the cdc quarantine area or to a local
[4:27:27.760 --> 4:27:33.360]  health official for an evaluation for some they say any extra tax is a welcome response
[4:27:34.080 --> 4:27:38.320]  do you get that yeah that's marcia law when they say we're gonna make you go to a facility
[4:27:38.320 --> 4:27:42.800]  that's already level five or six and i was saying yesterday when i saw those articles
[4:27:42.800 --> 4:27:47.440]  were already at level five so they're saying we're at five steve that means we're at six
[4:27:47.440 --> 4:27:51.440]  like yesterday they said we were four but we really said we were five now they're saying
[4:27:51.440 --> 4:27:56.000]  we're five have they already gone to six steve quail yes they have because time magazines are
[4:27:56.000 --> 4:28:03.040]  written an article about it you know we are going to face mandatory forest vaccinations i believe
[4:28:03.040 --> 4:28:08.880]  alex isn't in the fine 250 grand in five years in jail for refusing it well you know try and get
[4:28:08.880 --> 4:28:14.720]  250 grand out of some guy that is just totally wiped out but you see the law has got to be in
[4:28:14.720 --> 4:28:21.200]  place so that these monsters have justification or all mine for carrying out the destruction of
[4:28:21.200 --> 4:28:25.920]  their family or their fellow countrymen and and that's what that's what i'll tell you what's
[4:28:25.920 --> 4:28:31.440]  incredible other patriot talk shows i turn into yep are making fun of us even covering this
[4:28:32.160 --> 4:28:36.960]  uh... even on this network and are busy talking about issues of little or no significance
[4:28:36.960 --> 4:28:42.320]  uh... it's obvious and it's obvious where their allegiance lies it's obvious
[4:28:42.320 --> 4:28:46.560]  where their loyalties lie and it's obvious probably that who's paying them look i make no
[4:28:46.560 --> 4:28:52.160]  bones about it you cannot be where we're at and anybody listen i'm saying this and i'll say this
[4:28:52.160 --> 4:28:56.960]  so alex to don't give alex he'd give me the heat for this but anybody that's making fun of us when
[4:28:56.960 --> 4:29:02.400]  we have been so right even to the urgent alert all of the everything that we've both done has
[4:29:02.400 --> 4:29:07.840]  brought everyone to this point they are on the other side and i don't give a darn who's who's
[4:29:07.840 --> 4:29:11.840]  think that if anybody is saying what we're saying to warm people to save their lives
[4:29:11.840 --> 4:29:15.760]  then they are the enemy and they are as much an enemy as the people that are coming in with
[4:29:15.760 --> 4:29:20.800]  the blueberries to blow us all away well what they do is and i don't even think some of them
[4:29:20.800 --> 4:29:26.480]  are agents and it's other networks and people is that they say that i'm saying it's a pandemic
[4:29:26.480 --> 4:29:31.200]  when from day one i went on the air saturday and friday but saturday i should know i think this
[4:29:31.200 --> 4:29:35.200]  is hype but the way they're acting and the police state they're setting up and all the
[4:29:35.200 --> 4:29:40.720]  preparation and pre-hype i saw go into this tells me that they're getting ready for a big move
[4:29:40.720 --> 4:29:47.840]  like 9 11 absolutely and so and so all i'm saying is there's a lot of crazy crap going on and they
[4:29:47.840 --> 4:29:52.400]  stand to gain we're not the ones that are putting this alert out it's the government they're the
[4:29:52.400 --> 4:29:57.040]  ones saying they're getting ready for forced inoculations and in north in north carolina and
[4:29:57.040 --> 4:30:01.600]  california and texas saying they're going to have checkpoints and grab you off the street
[4:30:01.600 --> 4:30:06.880]  i mean you know hell all i'm doing is reporting what's going on and when you even use the sources
[4:30:06.880 --> 4:30:12.720]  they all pay attention to to validate their positions then you know look here's the thing
[4:30:12.720 --> 4:30:18.720]  people don't understand alex there is an entire division in north com that does nothing but try
[4:30:18.720 --> 4:30:24.880]  and neutralize what you and i say i'm not making me or you important all i'm saying is this
[4:30:24.880 --> 4:30:30.560]  is that to keep the maximum amount of sheep asleep before they get slaughtered there is
[4:30:30.560 --> 4:30:36.560]  absolute cyberwarper going on spiritual warfare going on soon to be liberal warfare going on
[4:30:36.560 --> 4:30:41.520]  and and the hills are you know are too busy on the different boards making sure well do you know
[4:30:41.520 --> 4:30:45.760]  that's the quail for this or that's that alex jones and i are only in this for the money you
[4:30:45.760 --> 4:30:50.640]  want to know something i can't tell people they wouldn't believe us but how much of our money
[4:30:50.640 --> 4:30:56.720]  on our our our our the stuff we've accumulated if you will buy other things we've done just goes
[4:30:56.720 --> 4:31:00.480]  right back into this thing you know so when they spend a half a million dollars out their pocket
[4:31:00.480 --> 4:31:05.520]  or whatever it is in your case you know the point is i'm just telling you that people should learn
[4:31:05.520 --> 4:31:10.160]  to be discerning if everything that we're well that's a distraction everything we say comes to
[4:31:10.160 --> 4:31:14.000]  everything we've said has been right and of course it takes funds to pay all these people
[4:31:14.000 --> 4:31:19.280]  and do all this we're totally obsessed with finding the new world order we need more donations
[4:31:19.280 --> 4:31:24.640]  people need to buy more of our books and videos and support us and but not even that's look i i make
[4:31:24.640 --> 4:31:31.360]  the films like truth rising in game jason makes fabled enemies you know obama deception and day
