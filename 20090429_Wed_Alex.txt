[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.864]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.864 --> 00:00:11.445]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:13.006]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.006 --> 00:00:17.209]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.209 --> 00:00:22.633]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.633 --> 00:00:27.797]  We are hoping and praying for the best, but preparing for the worst, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:29.639 --> 00:00:53.117]  And I've been saying since Saturday when I did that two hour emergency update transmission on the designer flu story, as it was really starting to become a panic, that if deaths began in the United States, then we would have an issue, because it's the fast spread of this flu.
[00:00:53.117 --> 00:00:55.219]  It's the long incubation period.
[00:00:56.261 --> 00:00:58.864]  You can't detect it and somebody can spread it for a long time.
[00:00:58.864 --> 00:01:03.989]  You don't know they're sick, you don't know they have a temperature, because they don't have a temperature.
[00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:12.517]  And I've continued to say that if deaths start in the United States, that we have to start taking this a lot more serious.
[00:01:12.517 --> 00:01:16.281]  I've been hoping this was hype, I've been hoping that this was
[00:01:17.182 --> 00:01:28.112]  Gonna not be a big deal because I'm right here in Texas where this stuff first broke out in the United States and Austin, Texas, where I live, is where the first death happened.
[00:01:28.112 --> 00:01:36.340]  A 23-month-old baby died here in Austin, Texas, where I live.
[00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.223]  And I know a lot of people that are having respiratory problems.
[00:01:40.223 --> 00:01:40.664]  It is not
[00:01:42.237 --> 00:01:44.521]  Imaginary, it's not psychosomatic.
[00:01:44.521 --> 00:01:49.108]  They are throwing up, they got diarrhea, they're coughing.
[00:01:49.108 --> 00:01:51.071]  A lot of people are sick.
[00:01:51.071 --> 00:01:54.817]  A lot of people that work in my office have sick family members.
[00:01:54.817 --> 00:01:56.720]  And, you know, Hoos, I saw him on Sunday.
[00:01:57.981 --> 00:01:59.241]  Paul Hartman.
[00:01:59.241 --> 00:02:00.982]  And he'd been in San Antonio visiting family.
[00:02:00.982 --> 00:02:02.783]  He didn't even really know about all this.
[00:02:02.783 --> 00:02:06.044]  And he came in saying, oh, sorry, you know, I couldn't come in and help you Saturday.
[00:02:06.044 --> 00:02:07.424]  My wife's sick.
[00:02:07.424 --> 00:02:09.985]  So these are people that didn't even know about this flu stuff.
[00:02:09.985 --> 00:02:12.266]  You know, back on Saturday, it wasn't big news.
[00:02:12.266 --> 00:02:14.527]  They were going, oh yeah, my wife and kid are real sick.
[00:02:14.527 --> 00:02:16.587]  Now, she's at home getting better.
[00:02:16.587 --> 00:02:17.868]  She's getting better, right, Paul?
[00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.602]  Not like this little 23-month-old that's dead here in Austin.
[00:02:22.602 --> 00:02:27.986]  So, I am here broadcasting from where we have the first death in the United States, they're saying.
[00:02:27.986 --> 00:02:33.570]  And whole schools are cancelled in Texas and New York and other places.
[00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.151]  Hospitals are filled with people.
[00:02:35.151 --> 00:02:39.494]  A lot of folks are getting put on ventilators, respirators in Mexico.
[00:02:40.814 --> 00:02:52.999]  Clearly the government's been covering up the full spread and extent of this, so their actions show that they're really concerned about it, but then their rhetoric shows, oh, it's no big deal, no problem.
[00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:55.179]  Now let me tell you who we got coming up on the broadcast today.
[00:02:55.179 --> 00:02:57.840]  This is going to be quite an informative transmission.
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:05.383]  Bob Chapman, who has friends and family in Mexico and a lot of intel in Mexico, will be popping in in 30 minutes.
[00:03:05.383 --> 00:03:07.644]  He's got some developments there, and he can tell you about them.
[00:03:09.181 --> 00:03:15.245]  Larry Pratt's coming on briefly about this treaty that will ban all reloading in the United States.
[00:03:15.245 --> 00:03:17.326]  This is not a drill, not a joke.
[00:03:17.326 --> 00:03:20.668]  This is from Gun Owners of America, the second largest Second Amendment group.
[00:03:20.668 --> 00:03:22.289]  And I have the treaty.
[00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:24.171]  He's just popping in for about ten minutes.
[00:03:24.171 --> 00:03:35.238]  Then Dr. Lynn Horowitz, who has put out a very powerful report that's up on InfoWars.com, a text report and an audio report right now at InfoWars.com.
[00:03:37.315 --> 00:03:40.016]  Where he details and lays out who and what he thinks is behind this.
[00:03:40.016 --> 00:03:44.698]  We'll be playing that audio coming up in the next segment.
[00:03:44.698 --> 00:03:52.961]  And then, I'm going to play what Ron Paul has to say about all of this from last night to give you both views on this.
[00:03:52.961 --> 00:04:02.145]  But the reason I respect Horowitz, nothing I've ever heard Horowitz say has turned out to be wrong.
[00:04:02.145 --> 00:04:06.107]  When he talks about the history of bioweapons, the Nazis, the eugenicists, I learned a lot from him.
[00:04:06.806 --> 00:04:16.831]  Now I gotta say, when he gets into his kind of New Age Christianity and all of that, I'm not pooh-poohing it, I just can't prove it one way or the other, and he's kind of gotten more off into that, so we haven't had him on as much in the last few years.
[00:04:16.831 --> 00:04:19.653]  He was on with Burmese a few weeks ago, 9 to midnight.
[00:04:19.653 --> 00:04:27.937]  But when he's talking about bio-weapons, how they work, he's a Harvard grad, he has broken so many major stories and always been right, it blew me away.
[00:04:27.937 --> 00:04:32.240]  He was the first guy, a week into the anthrax attack in 2001, that said
[00:04:37.381 --> 00:04:40.984]  It was a Fort Detrick, Maryland, weaponized, miniaturized version.
[00:04:40.984 --> 00:04:49.029]  The FBI was so threatened, it was in mainstream news, they visited him and tried to say he was behind it when he had no connection to Fort Detrick, trying to shut him down.
[00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:51.831]  Years later it came out he was exactly right.
[00:04:51.831 --> 00:04:53.812]  He's fingering people.
[00:04:53.812 --> 00:04:54.993]  He's pointing them out.
[00:04:54.993 --> 00:04:57.615]  He says he knows exactly how this happened and who did it.
[00:04:57.615 --> 00:04:58.295]  It's powerful.
[00:04:58.295 --> 00:04:58.756]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.802 --> 00:05:02.504]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[00:05:02.504 --> 00:05:04.246]  What does humidity mean to you?
[00:05:04.246 --> 00:05:06.929]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[00:05:06.929 --> 00:05:12.075]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[00:05:12.075 --> 00:05:15.259]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:18.763]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.

[00:05:31.702 --> 00:05:34.024]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[00:05:34.024 --> 00:05:35.445]  I use one every day.
[00:05:35.445 --> 00:05:37.887]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[00:05:38.087 --> 00:05:41.309]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:06:07.621 --> 00:06:13.505]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:06:13.505 --> 00:06:20.009]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:21.970]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:24.451]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:06:24.451 --> 00:06:35.318]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.281]  It's not about left or right.
[00:06:39.281 --> 00:06:41.142]  It's about a one world government.
[00:06:41.142 --> 00:06:48.044]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:06:56.308 --> 00:06:57.888]  The Obama Deception.
[00:06:57.888 --> 00:06:59.069]  The people strike back.
[00:07:00.859 --> 00:07:02.320]  So you want to stop smoking.
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.601]  Well, here's what I want you to do.
[00:07:03.601 --> 00:07:06.483]  Go to a drugstore and take a stop smoking product off the shelf.
[00:07:06.483 --> 00:07:10.467]  Go to the cashier, tell him you don't want to pay for the product, you just want to take it home and try it.
[00:07:10.467 --> 00:07:14.250]  And if, and only if, you stop smoking, will you then come back and pay for it.
[00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:16.251]  Most likely, if you try this, you'd be arrested.
[00:07:16.251 --> 00:07:20.555]  But as silly as this sounds, this is exactly what the Smokefree free trial offer is.

[00:07:49.729 --> 00:07:53.830]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:55.791]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:17.383 --> 00:08:24.325]  All right, there are confirmed cases of this strain.
[00:08:24.325 --> 00:08:35.728]  This designer, who appears to be a designer, lab strain, popping up all over Asia, Europe, the United States, Mexico.
[00:08:35.728 --> 00:08:39.389]  And I had a local Austin News report that must have been incorrect.
[00:08:39.389 --> 00:08:42.029]  You know, there's so much craziness going on.
[00:08:42.029 --> 00:08:43.810]  The death was in Houston.
[00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:50.532]  The death was in Houston, but there are people in Austin and San Antonio hospitals.
[00:08:50.532 --> 00:08:52.572]  But a lot of that, we hope, is panicking.
[00:08:52.572 --> 00:08:54.913]  But there has been a death.
[00:08:54.913 --> 00:09:00.195]  This is out of the Houston Chronicle.
[00:09:00.195 --> 00:09:04.836]  CDC says Texas swine flu death is first in U.S.
[00:09:04.836 --> 00:09:09.838]  Child died in a Houston hospital after being transported from Brownsville.
[00:09:10.916 --> 00:09:19.559]  The first reported death in the United States from the swine flu outbreak was that of a 23-month-old Mexico City boy who fell ill in Brownsville.
[00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:20.340]  We're now learning more.
[00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:22.741]  Just an hour ago, this was not out.
[00:09:22.741 --> 00:09:23.601]  Okay?
[00:09:23.601 --> 00:09:27.282]  Just an hour ago, when I was printing these stories, they were going to get the cities wrong.
[00:09:27.282 --> 00:09:28.963]  So, uh, that is good news.
[00:09:28.963 --> 00:09:30.584]  It's not good news he's dead.
[00:09:30.584 --> 00:09:38.387]  It's good news because I was saying, uh, you know, clearly when I called Paul Watson this morning to do a story and others,
[00:09:39.454 --> 00:09:54.288]  That if this person died and was in the United States, or came from a Mexican city that wasn't a big metropolis, and that wasn't Mexico City, that this could be a race-specific bioweapon.
[00:09:54.288 --> 00:10:04.458]  I mean, if all you've got dying is Mexicans, in the United States, in Mexico, and in other countries, then this thing is race-specific.
[00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:10.893]  But, if you can look at Mexico City, one of the most toxic, full of dioxins and poisons.
[00:10:10.893 --> 00:10:19.939]  We've had medical doctors on with all the studies about how if you're already toxic, how that can allow flus that normally aren't lethal to kill you.
[00:10:19.939 --> 00:10:23.001]  Because your immune system has been destroyed by the toxic chemicals.
[00:10:23.001 --> 00:10:34.769]  That's why drug addicts that use dirty methamphetamine that's been produced in, you know, backroom labs that are filled with all sorts of toxins.
[00:10:35.683 --> 00:10:42.025]  Because the drug dealers can't get the original chemicals they need to make the pure speed.
[00:10:42.025 --> 00:10:46.866]  Those sub-chemicals to make the speed are a controlled substance.
[00:10:46.866 --> 00:10:53.828]  So people have to mix four or five, six, seven, eight different chemicals together just to get each sub-component.
[00:10:53.828 --> 00:11:02.291]  And so you might have 10, 20, 30, 40, depending on what recipe it is, chemicals mixed together and then improperly separated out in things.
[00:11:02.291 --> 00:11:04.072]  And then they call it speed.
[00:11:04.072 --> 00:11:04.912]  You're really just taking
[00:11:05.532 --> 00:11:05.932]  I don't know.
[00:11:27.739 --> 00:11:30.861]  Reportedly, it feels pretty wild.
[00:11:30.861 --> 00:11:41.909]  So that's why all these people end up getting quote, HIV-like diseases, AIDS-like diseases caused by HIV, but they test their blood and they have no HIV virus.
[00:11:41.909 --> 00:11:45.852]  The toxins have just killed all their white blood cells, and now a common cold will kill them.
[00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:50.313]  So that's what's going on, at least in the past in Mexico City.
[00:11:50.313 --> 00:11:54.576]  People die of the common flu by the hundreds a day in Mexico City.
[00:11:54.576 --> 00:11:56.538]  The common cold by hundreds a day.
[00:11:56.538 --> 00:11:58.179]  So they talk about 150-something dead.
[00:11:58.179 --> 00:11:59.661]  This is nothing!
[00:11:59.661 --> 00:12:06.246]  This is a hoax and pure hype unless they're covering up the true number of deaths.
[00:12:06.246 --> 00:12:11.091]  Because they're acting like this is the worst thing since the Spanish Flu of 1918.
[00:12:11.091 --> 00:12:13.593]  But if their government's telling the truth, it isn't.
[00:12:14.673 --> 00:12:25.260]  Though, it is not the flu season, it is not the cold season in Texas, and there's a bunch of people sick, and they're reporting a lot of normal flu cases, so I don't know what's going on.
[00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:35.146]  That's why we've got Dr. Len Horowitz coming up in an hour and a half, then we've got Steve Quayle joining us for an update in the last hour today with all his latest intel and info.
[00:12:36.127 --> 00:12:51.217]  So, the first reported death in the United States from the swine flu outbreak was that of a 23-year-old Mexico City boy who fell ill in Brownsville and was transported for treatment to Texas Children's Hospital in Houston, where he died Monday.
[00:12:51.217 --> 00:12:55.960]  Now, folks, it's Wednesday and they didn't tell us about this until this morning.
[00:12:57.765 --> 00:13:02.553]  In fact, this was posted at 1046 a.m.
[00:13:02.553 --> 00:13:05.318]  Central Standard Time in the Houston Chronicle.
[00:13:05.318 --> 00:13:07.702]  This went up on Drudge 25-30 minutes ago.
[00:13:07.702 --> 00:13:10.246]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:13:13.149 --> 00:13:17.953]  So this just came out, that's why there was even a wrong story here in the local news in Austin, saying it was Austin.
[00:13:17.953 --> 00:13:20.655]  So there's a lot of panicking, a lot of freaking out going on.
[00:13:20.655 --> 00:13:29.803]  Dr. David Perez, Director of the City's Emergency Medical Services, said the acutely ill child was admitted to Brownsville Hospital on April 13th.
[00:13:29.803 --> 00:13:33.546]  Well, they just die of... That's a long time ago, folks.
[00:13:33.546 --> 00:13:36.889]  That's 15 days ago, 16 days ago.
[00:13:36.889 --> 00:13:39.771]  And immediately was rushed by medical transport to Houston.
[00:13:39.771 --> 00:13:41.293]  So they've known about this in Houston,
[00:13:43.848 --> 00:13:46.390]  For close to two weeks.
[00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:56.780]  According to the Texas Department of State Health Services, so see, this kind of adds to, maybe they know it's already spread, maybe they know it has a long incubation as they've admitted, seven to eight days, maybe they know it is deadly.
[00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:59.162]  We don't know, we're going to find out though.
[00:13:59.162 --> 00:14:00.604]  We're going to find out in the next week or so.
[00:14:02.492 --> 00:14:05.455]  Is that more and more pieces of the puzzle come into play.
[00:14:05.455 --> 00:14:06.596]  We'll be covering it all here.
[00:14:06.596 --> 00:14:12.180]  According to the Texas Department of State Health Services, the boy already had several underlying health problems.
[00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:12.861]  So there you go.
[00:14:12.861 --> 00:14:16.704]  They're all ways... I'm reading this as... I got this right as we went on air.
[00:14:16.704 --> 00:14:19.266]  We're all reading this together.
[00:14:19.266 --> 00:14:21.368]  So see, like I said, run down, already sick.
[00:14:21.368 --> 00:14:23.009]  Was he a hemophiliac?
[00:14:23.009 --> 00:14:24.110]  That'll probably come out.
[00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:27.813]  Was he given Factor VIII from Bayer?
[00:14:27.813 --> 00:14:29.034]  Did he live in Mexico City?
[00:14:29.034 --> 00:14:30.576]  Was he poor in a toxic area?
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:41.207]  According to the Texas Department of Public Health Services, the boy already had several underlying health problems before he flew to Matamoros on April 4th and crossing to Brownsville to visit relatives.
[00:14:41.207 --> 00:14:45.670]  The boy came down with a fever April 8th, followed by another flu-like symptom.
[00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:47.191]  You know, you gotta love it.
[00:14:47.191 --> 00:14:51.054]  Whether you're Italian, German, Chinese, Spanish, it didn't matter.
[00:14:51.054 --> 00:14:54.996]  You came to this country, to Ellis Island, they tested you for diseases.
[00:14:54.996 --> 00:14:55.817]  Were you sick?
[00:14:55.817 --> 00:14:57.598]  You had to stay in quarantine.
[00:14:57.598 --> 00:14:58.599]  Not in America now.
[00:14:58.599 --> 00:15:00.300]  It's wide open, but if you're a U.S.
[00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:01.081]  citizen coming over,
[00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:04.761]  You're lucky if you don't get a proctology exam.
[00:15:04.761 --> 00:15:05.841]  You know, putting the gloves on.
[00:15:05.841 --> 00:15:08.542]  Because we're the cows.
[00:15:08.542 --> 00:15:09.562]  We're the slaves.
[00:15:09.562 --> 00:15:12.924]  We're the milk cows to be fed on and treated like scum.
[00:15:12.924 --> 00:15:17.205]  Not people with deadly flus or whatever.
[00:15:17.205 --> 00:15:22.527]  Peres learned of the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention confirmation of the virus before dawn this morning.
[00:15:22.527 --> 00:15:28.028]  Other people accompanying the child have shown no signs of illness, and the boy was not known to be sick when he crossed the border.
[00:15:28.028 --> 00:15:29.089]  Yeah, right.
[00:15:29.089 --> 00:15:29.629]  Saying he was sick
[00:15:30.865 --> 00:15:32.625]  And then they brought him across the border.
[00:15:32.625 --> 00:15:37.807]  Came down with a fever April 8th, followed by other flu-like symptoms, and then he crossed the border.
[00:15:37.807 --> 00:15:44.749]  Those precautions include, it says, uh, they, this doesn't really change the landscape here in Houston, he said.
[00:15:44.749 --> 00:15:50.930]  We know it's in the U.S., it's in Texas, we need to take our own personal precautions.
[00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:57.512]  That's why the first thing they said Sunday at the CDC and Homeland Security is, oh, it's already spread everywhere, we're not going to control the borders.
[00:15:59.281 --> 00:16:06.986]  But then they start saying there may be another strain in Mexico that's killing everybody, a different mutation of this and earlier strains in the U.S.
[00:16:06.986 --> 00:16:10.469]  Well, if they're saying that's a possibility, why isn't that border shut?
[00:16:10.469 --> 00:16:13.030]  Because they won't shut it come hell or high water!
[00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:17.373]  The SPP, Security Prosperity Partnership North American Union Plan,
[00:16:18.334 --> 00:16:34.280]  That we've published and posted their own documents is to use flu and smallpox outbreaks to create a contiguous border from Alaska through Canada through the United States to Mexico with its border with Central America with Guatemala.
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:36.161]  They're going to use this crisis to set this up.
[00:16:36.161 --> 00:16:38.082]  We're already under UN control.
[00:16:38.082 --> 00:16:44.284]  The UN Secretary General bragged yesterday that we're at level 4 and that the US and Mexico are following World Health Organization orders.
[00:16:46.308 --> 00:16:57.132]  Those precautions include hand-washing, covering coughs or seizures, and contacting a physician upon detection of flu-like symptoms such as fever, body aches, nausea, and upset stomach, he said.
[00:16:57.132 --> 00:17:05.536]  Mayor Bill White said today, it should come as no surprise that severely ill people are transported to a city where some of the most outstanding medical facilities in the world.
[00:17:05.536 --> 00:17:09.437]  That does not mean that Houston is somehow an epicenter of the swine flu.
[00:17:09.437 --> 00:17:12.779]  Yeah, we were all arguing around the office where we thought it would first have deaths,
[00:17:13.639 --> 00:17:14.940]  I'm on record!
[00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:18.361]  I said I thought it would be Houston.
[00:17:18.361 --> 00:17:22.603]  I said I think it'll be Houston where it first pops up.
[00:17:22.603 --> 00:17:29.305]  There still have been no reported Houston area cases of the disease, which is thought to have begun in Mexico, but is being detected around the globe.
[00:17:29.305 --> 00:17:35.248]  However, Houston Department of Health and Human Services spokesman Kathy Barton said this will likely change.
[00:17:35.248 --> 00:17:37.249]  We expect to see confirmations in the next few days.
[00:17:38.522 --> 00:17:39.443]  As does the rest of the country.
[00:17:39.443 --> 00:17:41.164]  Yeah, it's spread everywhere.
[00:17:41.164 --> 00:17:45.106]  Let's go ahead and start with Ron Paul into the break.
[00:17:45.106 --> 00:17:55.473]  He said this last night before there had been a confirmed death, but I hope he's right, and I tend to lean towards what he's saying, but we'll get the views of Steve Quayle, Dr. Lynn Horowitz, and others today.
[00:17:55.473 --> 00:17:57.515]  Let's go ahead and go to this tape of Ron Paul last night.
[00:17:57.515 --> 00:17:59.756]  This is up on InfoWars.com.
[00:17:59.756 --> 00:18:05.340]  Looks like our government's getting us pretty upset and concerned about the swine flu.
[00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:08.142]  This is interesting to me, not only for political reasons, but also
[00:18:08.644 --> 00:18:17.787]  As a physician, it makes me think back to 1976, the first year I served in the Congress, we had a vote on the swine flu.
[00:18:17.787 --> 00:18:31.410]  Back then there was a panic and they said it was going to sweep the nation and they rapidly came up with some flu shots and the government was going to inoculate everybody and save the world from this disaster.
[00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:36.572]  I remember there were two votes against it, myself and Larry McDonald, another physician.
[00:18:37.427 --> 00:18:40.568]  It turned out though that our instincts were correct.
[00:18:40.568 --> 00:18:58.571]  Not only did we object to it because we didn't think the government should be in the medical business and making these medical decisions, but it turned out that the instincts were absolutely right because the flu came and the flu went and one person died except for those individuals who died from getting the flu vaccine.
[00:18:58.571 --> 00:19:06.293]  And over 25 people died just from getting the vaccine and many got ill from it until finally they had to suspend the whole program.
[00:19:07.026 --> 00:19:11.672]  Here we are, once again, the swine flu coming up and everybody's panicking.
[00:19:11.672 --> 00:19:13.695]  And this is not to downplay the seriousness.
[00:19:13.695 --> 00:19:17.701]  Some people have died, some people might die yet.
[00:19:17.701 --> 00:19:22.527]  We've had no deaths in this country, but there are seven or eight cases up in New York.
[00:19:22.527 --> 00:19:24.350]  None have even been hospitalized.
[00:19:25.015 --> 00:19:29.898]  And yet, it's practically like we've been attacked by nuclear weapons.
[00:19:29.898 --> 00:19:35.901]  I mean, press conference over the weekend, prime item for the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:19:35.901 --> 00:19:39.983]  How did the Department of Homeland Security get into the medical business?
[00:19:39.983 --> 00:19:47.587]  You know, it just is totally, totally out of control on what they think we should do.
[00:19:47.587 --> 00:19:53.390]  But, you know, trying to put this in a perspective, I checked to find out how many cases of tuberculosis we had last year.
[00:19:54.145 --> 00:19:56.906]  We had about 13,000 cases of tuberculosis.
[00:19:56.906 --> 00:20:00.927]  Now that's a serious disease.
[00:20:00.927 --> 00:20:01.828]  Attention gardeners!
[00:20:01.828 --> 00:20:04.429]  This is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[00:20:04.429 --> 00:20:08.950]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs.
[00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:17.153]  It's called Proto-Gro and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[00:20:17.153 --> 00:20:19.974]  Now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:27.892]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[00:20:27.892 --> 00:20:33.713]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[00:20:33.713 --> 00:20:39.554]  Proto-Gro's full-spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[00:20:39.554 --> 00:20:42.795]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[00:20:43.095 --> 00:20:46.676]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[00:20:46.676 --> 00:20:51.758]  GCN listeners who want to grow Dirt Chief superfoods should visit the ProtoGro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[00:20:51.758 --> 00:20:54.639]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[00:20:54.639 --> 00:20:54.959]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:20:54.959 --> 00:20:57.820]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:21:07.006 --> 00:21:14.590]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:21.134]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:21:21.134 --> 00:21:23.155]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:21:23.155 --> 00:21:25.657]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:21:25.657 --> 00:21:36.603]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:38.892]  It's not about left or right.
[00:21:38.892 --> 00:21:40.754]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:21:40.754 --> 00:21:47.681]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:21:47.681 --> 00:21:55.950]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:57.511]  The Obama Deception.
[00:21:57.511 --> 00:21:58.713]  The people strike back.
[00:22:00.404 --> 00:22:02.605]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:22:02.605 --> 00:22:02.945]  April 29th, 2009.
[00:22:02.945 --> 00:22:03.925]  Gold open this morning at $898.
[00:22:03.925 --> 00:22:06.986]  A one ounce gold coin to be purchased for $924.12, $462.06 for a half ounce, or $231.03 for the quarter ounce.
[00:22:06.986 --> 00:22:07.566]  That's $924.12, $462.06, and $231.03.
[00:22:17.649 --> 00:22:30.339]  On June 4th, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110, was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[00:22:30.339 --> 00:22:33.581]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[00:22:33.581 --> 00:22:36.964]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[00:22:36.964 --> 00:22:39.846]  However, the Executive Order still stands unrepealed.
[00:22:40.086 --> 00:22:42.927]  Midas has the Kennedy vs. Fed document.
[00:22:42.927 --> 00:22:45.888]  Call 800-686-2237.

[00:24:09.397 --> 00:24:11.158]  Fitting song for the stuff going on.
[00:24:11.158 --> 00:24:15.899]  There's a man going around taking names.
[00:24:15.899 --> 00:24:21.502]  And he decides who to free and who to blame.
[00:24:21.502 --> 00:24:26.164]  Everybody will be treated all the same.
[00:24:26.164 --> 00:24:32.446]  There'll be a golden ladder reaching down.
[00:24:32.446 --> 00:24:34.107]  When the man comes around.
[00:24:38.729 --> 00:24:51.980]  Yeah, those of you that serve the dark God, you serve the weak God.
[00:24:51.980 --> 00:25:00.768]  We worship the God that creates life and the universe and all that is good.
[00:25:00.768 --> 00:25:02.009]  That's who I'm with.
[00:25:02.009 --> 00:25:02.530]  What about you?
[00:25:08.688 --> 00:25:35.274]  One hundred million angels singing Multitudes are marching to the big kettle drum Voices calling, voices crying Some are born and some are dying It's Alpha and Omega's kingdom come And the whirlwind
[00:25:36.406 --> 00:25:40.228]  All right, let's go ahead and go back to Congressman Ron Paul.
[00:25:40.228 --> 00:25:41.949]  Then I've got the economic news.
[00:25:41.949 --> 00:25:48.553]  There is no doubt whether this is a serious pandemic or not, that they are using it as a political distraction.
[00:25:48.553 --> 00:25:53.436]  The economic numbers just came in and it's worse and moving quicker than even I had thought.
[00:25:54.574 --> 00:25:57.757]  So that's the guaranteed devastation that's happening.
[00:25:57.757 --> 00:26:06.365]  Meanwhile, Obama's meant to radiate confidence and happiness with all the smiling and the giddiness and he starts laughing and giggling in all interviews and it's all bubbly.
[00:26:06.365 --> 00:26:09.428]  It's acting.
[00:26:09.428 --> 00:26:12.771]  And the interviewer from 60 Minutes says, are you drunk?
[00:26:12.771 --> 00:26:14.113]  Are you punch drunk?
[00:26:14.113 --> 00:26:16.895]  It's all an act.
[00:26:16.895 --> 00:26:19.398]  To make it look like to all the natives, the American people,
[00:26:21.184 --> 00:26:23.005]  Everything's calm, everything's fine.
[00:26:23.005 --> 00:26:24.125]  Just go about your business.
[00:26:24.125 --> 00:26:31.747]  Obama's up there acting like he's sitting in his easy chair, you know, in the sun drinking a Corona, while everything collapses and burns behind him.
[00:26:31.747 --> 00:26:33.428]  And they go, but look!
[00:26:33.428 --> 00:26:35.008]  You know, the head bird.
[00:26:35.008 --> 00:26:38.989]  You ever notice how there's one bird and a flock of birds and all the other birds watch?
[00:26:38.989 --> 00:26:41.090]  And if that bird flies and takes off, they all do.
[00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:43.691]  But if one of the lesser birds does, they don't.
[00:26:43.691 --> 00:26:45.692]  I mean, that's how humans operate.
[00:26:45.692 --> 00:26:46.792]  It's how wolves operate.
[00:26:47.509 --> 00:26:48.749]  It's how a lot of creatures operate.
[00:26:48.749 --> 00:26:50.170]  We're all watching Obama.
[00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:51.110]  He says it's fine.
[00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:52.070]  It must be.
[00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:53.491]  The bankers love me.
[00:26:53.491 --> 00:26:57.152]  Here's Ron Paul getting into what he thinks is going on with the flu.
[00:26:57.152 --> 00:27:00.032]  About 13,000 cases of tuberculosis.
[00:27:00.032 --> 00:27:02.293]  Now that's a serious disease.
[00:27:02.293 --> 00:27:05.894]  And also, the last time they recorded the number of deaths in this country was in 06.
[00:27:05.894 --> 00:27:07.534]  And there were 644 deaths from tuberculosis.
[00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:24.550]  Now, I hate to even bring that subject up to try to put this in a proper perspective, because maybe tomorrow they're going to quarantine everybody in the world coming into this country to watch out for tuberculosis.
[00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:28.201]  And all these things are very serious.
[00:27:28.201 --> 00:27:33.122]  The big question is, does a bigger government always solve these problems?
[00:27:33.122 --> 00:27:35.463]  They usually make things much worse.
[00:27:35.463 --> 00:27:44.826]  So all I'm asking people to do is step back and think for a minute rather than rushing and panicking and taking advantage of opportunities like this.
[00:27:44.826 --> 00:27:48.907]  This is what happens whether they're economic problems or medical problems.
[00:27:48.907 --> 00:27:51.208]  The people who love big governments take advantage of this.
[00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:58.974]  And in the Department of Homeland Security, she's really not acting outside the prerogatives of that department.
[00:27:58.974 --> 00:28:05.078]  And one of the reasons I voted against it, it's an open-door invitation to deal with medical problems.
[00:28:05.078 --> 00:28:15.685]  And of course, the way I see medical care in this country is deteriorating and the costs are skyrocketing, mainly because we have had central economic planning and medicine now for 30-some years.
[00:28:15.685 --> 00:28:19.627]  It hasn't worked very well, so now we're about to embark on socialized medicine.
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:29.128]  But I just don't think that we need the government in this manner dealing with this problem in a hysterical manner.
[00:28:29.128 --> 00:28:34.013]  We ought to just sit back and think about it for a minute and maybe we'll come to our senses.
[00:28:34.013 --> 00:28:37.096]  But certainly it isn't a responsibility.
[00:28:37.532 --> 00:28:39.834]  on of the department of homeland security
[00:29:07.762 --> 00:29:25.016]  To Texas, back on April 8th, brought into a hospital in Brownsville, Texas, on the border, and then taken to Houston, and then died there, confirmed of this new mutagen flu that's got pig, human, and bird in it.
[00:29:25.016 --> 00:29:28.339]  All the experts, medical doctors we've talked to, call it designer.
[00:29:28.339 --> 00:29:29.880]  Every piece of evidence shows that.
[00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:32.442]  It's popped up out of season in the wrong hemisphere.
[00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:36.351]  It's just all the evidence points towards manufactured.
[00:29:36.351 --> 00:29:37.771]  But the big news is economic.
[00:29:37.771 --> 00:29:40.311]  We'll tell you about that briefly when we come back.
[00:29:40.311 --> 00:29:43.552]  And Bob Chapman's got a lot of intel of what's going on in Mexico.
[00:29:43.552 --> 00:29:45.813]  He's got friends and family that work down there.
[00:29:45.813 --> 00:29:49.233]  We'll get a report from Bob Chapman, the international forecaster, straight ahead.
[00:29:49.233 --> 00:29:51.114]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:29:51.114 --> 00:29:52.494]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.494 --> 00:29:55.034]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.034 --> 00:29:57.715]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.107 --> 00:30:11.677]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[00:30:11.677 --> 00:30:13.098]  Garden in a can!
[00:30:13.098 --> 00:30:17.242]  Garden in a can is your source for premium long-term storable seeds.
[00:30:17.242 --> 00:30:19.264]  Garden in a can is ready when you are.
[00:30:19.264 --> 00:30:21.566]  Plant them now or store them for when you really need them.
[00:30:22.026 --> 00:30:31.695]  There are 16 large hermetically sealed non-hybrid open pollinated packets of seeds along with detailed planting instructions sealed in a can for ultimate long-term protection.
[00:30:31.695 --> 00:30:33.117]  Garden in a can.
[00:30:33.117 --> 00:30:34.318]  It's that simple.
[00:30:34.318 --> 00:30:35.038]  Fresh.
[00:30:35.038 --> 00:30:35.899]  Healthy.
[00:30:35.899 --> 00:30:36.720]  Easy.
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:41.064]  Only $69.95 for over a half acre of safe fresh vegetables.
[00:30:41.064 --> 00:30:41.945]  Ready when you are.

[00:30:52.806 --> 00:30:56.828]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:30:56.828 --> 00:30:57.928]  We've got to give them a stake.
[00:31:08.507 --> 00:31:12.750]  In creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:19.254]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:19.254 --> 00:31:21.235]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:21.235 --> 00:31:23.697]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:31:23.697 --> 00:31:34.584]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:31:36.872 --> 00:31:38.534]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:38.534 --> 00:31:40.396]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:31:40.396 --> 00:31:47.323]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:31:55.592 --> 00:31:57.153]  The Obama Deception.
[00:31:57.153 --> 00:31:58.355]  The people strike back.
[00:32:04.502 --> 00:32:07.785]  Times are tough right now, and people are unsure about our future.
[00:32:07.785 --> 00:32:12.069]  The economy is hurting, even though there are powers that would make us believe differently.
[00:32:12.069 --> 00:32:15.172]  Banks are failing, and the gold buyers are buying.
[00:32:15.172 --> 00:32:15.873]  Question.
[00:32:15.873 --> 00:32:23.340]  With all the chemicals being put into our air, how do you use gold when you are very sick or dead?
[00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:25.462]  Investing in precious metals is smart.
[00:32:25.462 --> 00:32:28.024]  Investing in your health could be smarter.
[00:32:28.024 --> 00:32:28.825]  Life change tea.
[00:32:29.343 --> 00:32:29.823]  Life Change Tea.
[00:32:29.823 --> 00:32:30.883]  We're changing lives.
[00:33:02.653 --> 00:33:03.356]  Yeah.
[00:33:11.294 --> 00:33:14.316]  We have a jam-packed transmission for you today.
[00:33:14.316 --> 00:33:17.597]  Bob's chatting with us for about 15 minutes.
[00:33:17.597 --> 00:33:23.040]  He's got family in Mexico and business associates, and he's been talking to them in detail.
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:26.882]  We've been having callers on from Mexico City.
[00:33:26.882 --> 00:33:37.588]  In fact, that's the only open lines we've got is people in Houston that may know this dead child, people in Brownsville, people in other areas that are flu affected.
[00:33:37.588 --> 00:33:38.949]  If you have an eyewitness report,
[00:33:40.179 --> 00:33:40.319]  1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231
[00:33:49.022 --> 00:33:52.864]  Then we have Larry Pratt joining us for about 15 minutes in the next hour.
[00:33:52.864 --> 00:33:59.647]  Quick report, because there is bonafide, hardcore, massive gun control introduced.
[00:33:59.647 --> 00:34:03.208]  But as we told you, it's bypassing the legislative system in Congress.
[00:34:03.208 --> 00:34:04.569]  It is a treaty.
[00:34:04.569 --> 00:34:08.971]  Wait till you hear about this with the Director of Gunners of America, Larry Pratt.
[00:34:08.971 --> 00:34:10.292]  Then Dr. Lynn Horowitz.
[00:34:11.271 --> 00:34:15.935]  We'll be joining us with amazing developments and information, then Steve Quayle.
[00:34:15.935 --> 00:34:17.817]  That is a jam-packed transmission.
[00:34:17.817 --> 00:34:23.522]  Now, next hour we'll have some open phones, because again, Larry Pratt's only on with us for about 15 minutes.
[00:34:23.522 --> 00:34:27.845]  And then we will take calls and cover all the news as this develops.
[00:34:27.845 --> 00:34:31.589]  Confirmed death in Houston, but first when I saw it this morning,
[00:34:33.410 --> 00:34:34.791]  It said the death was in Austin, Texas.
[00:34:34.791 --> 00:34:36.152]  That was in mainstream news.
[00:34:36.152 --> 00:34:40.855]  Then, about 30 minutes before airtime, that's the time stamp on this.
[00:34:40.855 --> 00:34:47.859]  The Houston Chronicle's actually time stamped 14 minutes before airtime, 1046 AM Central Standard Time.
[00:34:47.859 --> 00:34:50.801]  They said, no, no, it's Houston, and all the details came out.
[00:34:50.801 --> 00:34:59.086]  First, the CDC and the Texas Health Department had just said there was a death in Texas and Austin, and they wouldn't say it was a boy or girl.
[00:34:59.086 --> 00:35:00.867]  Now they have said, specifically,
[00:35:02.619 --> 00:35:07.800]  So, 23-month-old Mexican national boy from Mexico City.
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:27.905]  Now, again, we're hoping it's not race-specific, because if it continues to just kill Mexicans, even in small, healthy towns, with well-to-do people, as is happening, and then it doesn't kill any gringos, blacks or whites, here in the United States, we got a problem.
[00:35:27.905 --> 00:35:29.365]  Because then you know it's designer.
[00:35:29.365 --> 00:35:31.366]  Race-specifics are almost always designer.
[00:35:32.199 --> 00:35:40.621]  A very, they say that it might, I've been reading up on it, might be able to occur in nature.
[00:35:40.621 --> 00:35:48.983]  You know, there's some breeds of wolves, some breeds of pigs, some breeds of skunk that are more successful, you know.
[00:35:48.983 --> 00:35:50.683]  I mean, just varieties, you know.
[00:35:50.683 --> 00:35:58.585]  That is, you can breed a certain variety of, say, skunk that's in the Florida Everglades that is more susceptible to
[00:35:59.976 --> 00:36:06.044]  You know, different diseases than a skunk you could breed it with from upstate New York.
[00:36:07.236 --> 00:36:08.536]  It's a different variety, though.
[00:36:08.536 --> 00:36:12.858]  Kind of like there's, what, six or seven varieties of wolves in the U.S.
[00:36:12.858 --> 00:36:15.419]  Five or six varieties, for some reason it's the same number.
[00:36:15.419 --> 00:36:18.160]  You know, they argue, is this really a different variety or is that?
[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:24.002]  But six or seven different varieties of mountain lion, puma, wildcat, you know, all the different names for it.
[00:36:24.002 --> 00:36:32.145]  But there's a tiny one in the Florida Everglades, only about 60 pounds, versus biggins in the West Texas.
[00:36:32.145 --> 00:36:34.286]  They're also in East Texas, but the biggest ones are in
[00:36:35.632 --> 00:36:44.398]  West Texas and South Texas Big Ben, you know, that get up to 190 pounds, 200 pounds, 220 pounds, that attack people!
[00:36:44.398 --> 00:36:57.647]  The variety in California, I'm already digressing into, it's interesting, the issue here is, this is race specific, if it only kills Hispanics, and that's what it looks like it's doing,
[00:36:59.005 --> 00:37:02.846]  Then we got a problem, but you have to look at all the environmental factors.
[00:37:02.846 --> 00:37:05.667]  One of the dirtiest, most toxic cities.
[00:37:05.667 --> 00:37:10.929]  I mean, I've seen documentaries and federal reports and the video of it.
[00:37:10.929 --> 00:37:15.790]  For some reason, the Travis County was airing on its cable channel about 12 years ago.
[00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:17.131]  I'll never forget seeing it.
[00:37:17.131 --> 00:37:20.132]  A documentary done by a county worker.
[00:37:20.132 --> 00:37:25.813]  Down there where it showed a third of the children born with this disorder with no brain or it's a tiny brain.
[00:37:25.813 --> 00:37:26.654]  They're just vegetables.
[00:37:26.654 --> 00:37:27.894]  They're born total vegetables.
[00:37:30.221 --> 00:37:37.663]  uh... because of all the toxic waste, and when I say all, I mean the majority of it is dumped in Mexico City from North America.
[00:37:37.663 --> 00:37:46.405]  Mexico takes it, they're so corrupt, they just put it in giant open landfills and the people live in and around the landfills and it seeps into the water table and they get it out of the well water, city water.
[00:37:46.405 --> 00:37:48.005]  They can't afford anything else.
[00:37:48.005 --> 00:37:58.628]  The documentary showed how an hour or two a day water will come out of the faucet and they all fight with jugs to get the water and you test it, it's total toxic waste, and the mothers drink this.
[00:38:00.247 --> 00:38:05.250]  Thirty plus million people in Mexico City, I digress, and Bob's holding.
[00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:06.951]  And it said he had underlying health issues.
[00:38:06.951 --> 00:38:08.452]  They're not saying what.
[00:38:08.452 --> 00:38:10.093]  He was from Mexico City.
[00:38:10.093 --> 00:38:18.618]  Now, if there are deaths in the United States of healthy Mexican-Americans, we are in a crisis.
[00:38:18.618 --> 00:38:22.480]  And I'm just praying and hoping that doesn't happen.
[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:26.002]  So we'll break all that down with Dr. Horowitz and many others coming up and Steve Quayle.
[00:38:26.002 --> 00:38:27.923]  Right now, Bob Chapman, who's got contacts,
[00:38:29.406 --> 00:38:36.550]  In Mexico, and he can tell us what's going on in Mexico.
[00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:39.212]  Bob Chapman, thank you for coming on.
[00:38:39.212 --> 00:38:39.952]  You're welcome.
[00:38:39.952 --> 00:38:41.293]  Nice to be here again.
[00:38:41.293 --> 00:38:57.442]  And what we've been able to find out is that the President of Mexico, Mr. Calderon, and those around him, they decided to implement what amounts to is martial law.
[00:38:58.574 --> 00:39:24.573]  in regard to the disease which has appeared in and around Mexico City and but not too much in the outlying areas although schools are being closed over most of the country and people are being told that they shouldn't congregate they shouldn't get together in groups
[00:39:25.114 --> 00:39:27.254]  Yeah, for those that don't know, here's the specifics.
[00:39:27.254 --> 00:39:34.296]  All eateries, all restaurants were ordered closed yesterday, all schools were ordered closed on Monday.
[00:39:34.296 --> 00:39:38.316]  Are people following those orders in Mexico?
[00:39:38.316 --> 00:39:40.377]  The schools are.
[00:39:40.377 --> 00:39:42.817]  The restaurants are not.
[00:39:42.817 --> 00:39:46.178]  Restaurants are open all over the country.
[00:39:46.178 --> 00:39:51.819]  In the soccer games that they had over the weekend, some cities allowed
[00:39:52.472 --> 00:39:56.654]  People to attend that didn't have any experience with the disease.
[00:39:56.654 --> 00:40:07.139]  In big cities, such as Monterey and Guadalajara and Mexico City, the games were played with nobody in the stands.
[00:40:07.139 --> 00:40:10.580]  And meetings are being called off, etc.
[00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:18.264]  But the only thing that I understand is open are restaurants.
[00:40:18.264 --> 00:40:20.945]  And I'm sure some of them are closed, but
[00:40:22.145 --> 00:40:26.230]  Uh, they've mentioned to me that they went out to eat last night.
[00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:38.544]  So, uh, and people are running around with masks on and, uh, you know, masks aren't very effective, uh, unless you happen to cough and spittle, uh, comes out of your mouth.
[00:40:38.544 --> 00:40:41.407]  Other than that, uh, they're not going to keep you from catching anything.
[00:40:43.888 --> 00:40:51.573]  Well, the regular mask, I've talked to medical doctors, they say it helps a little bit if you're constantly changing them every few hours.
[00:40:51.573 --> 00:41:01.579]  Every time you go out and you get around people, you've got to instantly take the mask off, put a new one on, because all they're good at is catching the spittle or mucus from a sneeze or a cough.
[00:41:02.219 --> 00:41:02.339]  Yeah.
[00:41:15.598 --> 00:41:19.380]  They say that would reduce it by around 90 percent, but most people don't have those.
[00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:21.701]  You do see the health workers in the U.S.
[00:41:21.701 --> 00:41:23.362]  and others actually wearing those now.
[00:41:23.362 --> 00:41:32.347]  Basically, they're glorified gas masks, and some of them are a hybrid in between a regular mask and a gas mask or a respirator.
[00:41:32.347 --> 00:41:33.468]  But you're absolutely right.
[00:41:33.468 --> 00:41:38.771]  I mean, if you're not changing these every time you go in another store or around people, it's worthless.
[00:41:38.771 --> 00:41:44.134]  If you have a truckload of them and you're constantly wearing them, it gives you some protection.
[00:41:46.411 --> 00:41:58.181]  Well, I think, you know, the discussion in Mexico among the people I talked to about this race-specific aspect.
[00:41:58.181 --> 00:42:08.650]  But my question is, if they have found cases in New Zealand and Israel and Scotland and other places, are they with Latinos in those areas?
[00:42:09.616 --> 00:42:12.098]  Well, no, see, it's not killing them.
[00:42:12.098 --> 00:42:18.602]  And with most race-specifics, as you know, Bob, it will make all homo sapiens sapiens sick.
[00:42:18.602 --> 00:42:21.604]  It just won't kill them.
[00:42:21.604 --> 00:42:25.046]  Or won't kill them as often.
[00:42:25.046 --> 00:42:33.912]  So... Well, you know, as you said earlier, I hope to God this is not race-specific, but there's no question
[00:42:35.225 --> 00:42:38.707]  This was made up in a laboratory by the U.S.
[00:42:38.707 --> 00:42:42.269]  government or someone in contact with them.
[00:42:42.269 --> 00:42:46.591]  And they're doing some experimenting for a whole bunch of reasons.
[00:42:46.591 --> 00:42:51.754]  Well, they admit they've made these exact type of splices in thousands of major labs, not hundreds.
[00:42:51.754 --> 00:42:56.416]  There's thousands of these labs that are doing these type of experiments.
[00:42:56.416 --> 00:42:57.037]  Ron Paul
[00:42:58.587 --> 00:43:05.086]  said yesterday that he thinks it's uh... hype and when he was first elected to his first term then he got kicked out and came back
[00:43:06.072 --> 00:43:07.133]  The Congress.
[00:43:07.133 --> 00:43:10.555]  I read his quotes yesterday.
[00:43:10.555 --> 00:43:14.198]  In fact, here's his quote.
[00:43:14.198 --> 00:43:19.201]  Ron Paul warns swine flu scare will be used as precedent for more big government.
[00:43:19.201 --> 00:43:27.727]  And Steve Watson did a story on Infowars.net on this, where he has the quotes from Ron Paul.
[00:43:30.529 --> 00:43:40.232]  Where he was saying in 76 this is nothing but fear-mongering and is going to be used to basically sell people on taking a dangerous vaccine.
[00:43:40.232 --> 00:43:43.453]  And it was as if he was prophetic.
[00:43:43.453 --> 00:43:46.994]  He predicted that with great, great
[00:43:48.134 --> 00:43:48.734]  Precision.
[00:43:48.734 --> 00:43:53.096]  This story is up on Infowars.com, PrisonBlock.com right now.
[00:43:53.096 --> 00:43:56.057]  Ron Paul warns of a swine flu scare.
[00:43:56.057 --> 00:44:05.419]  In fact, that was published in a book saying this was nothing but the government faremongering to sell vaccines and antiviral drugs.
[00:44:05.419 --> 00:44:09.300]  And Ron Paul said in a speech we just played earlier that it turned out his instincts were correct.
[00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:10.441]  So was Larry McDonald's.
[00:44:12.441 --> 00:44:16.683]  Who also predicted that at the time.
[00:44:16.683 --> 00:44:27.008]  Ron Paul described it, Ron Paul did in 76, as a shocking misuse of funds and an evil political maneuver, blatant
[00:44:28.047 --> 00:44:33.692]  Advertising effort to panic the public into taking swine flu shots, and he said it will fail.
[00:44:33.692 --> 00:44:34.873]  And it did fail.
[00:44:34.873 --> 00:44:36.494]  Oh yeah, you knew Larry McDonald.
[00:44:36.494 --> 00:44:37.315]  You've been an icon.
[00:44:37.315 --> 00:44:40.918]  He was the head of the John Byrne Society, a Democratic congressman from Georgia.
[00:44:40.918 --> 00:44:46.182]  They clearly killed him on flight 007, where his plane suddenly got cancelled, and he had to get on this other one.
[00:44:46.182 --> 00:44:48.484]  Tell folks about that.
[00:44:48.484 --> 00:44:55.090]  Well, Helene de Berlier, who's a good friend of myself, and Gary Allen in particular,
[00:44:55.566 --> 00:45:00.187]  In fact, I used to go and visit Hilaire when he was living in Monaco.
[00:45:00.187 --> 00:45:02.268]  And he was quite a character.
[00:45:02.268 --> 00:45:04.408]  Larry McDonald?
[00:45:04.408 --> 00:45:11.490]  Hilaire de Berrier, but the reason I bring him up is he was a foreign policy advisor for Larry.
[00:45:11.490 --> 00:45:19.231]  And he told me the story about what happened, which you just briefly explained.
[00:45:19.231 --> 00:45:22.112]  And Larry was a marked man.
[00:45:23.124 --> 00:45:26.868]  There was no question he was coming out with too many things and he had a lot of visibility.
[00:45:26.868 --> 00:45:29.770]  He was gaining momentum.
[00:45:29.770 --> 00:45:36.917]  He was gaining momentum and really leading the charge against the New World Order and going on TV and exposing everything.
[00:45:36.917 --> 00:45:47.086]  That's correct and he was a very charismatic speaker, a very handsome man and very confident.
[00:45:47.086 --> 00:45:48.788]  I had a long talk with him
[00:45:50.007 --> 00:46:01.594]  And of all places, San Jose, Costa Rica, about a year before he got killed, and we talked about Hilaire, who we knew jointly.
[00:46:01.594 --> 00:46:07.337]  But anybody who gets close to that sort of thing is marked.
[00:46:07.337 --> 00:46:14.982]  Somebody sent me a, and it's going to be in today's issue, which they're preparing right now, of the International Forecaster.
[00:46:15.666 --> 00:46:20.128]  And I didn't know about this, but I know Eustace Mullins quite well.
[00:46:20.128 --> 00:46:28.452]  In fact, I met him the same year I met Ed Griffith and Gary Allen and all of those fellows.
[00:46:28.452 --> 00:46:37.397]  And he had wrote a book about these inoculations or taking shots.
[00:46:37.397 --> 00:46:38.097]  Oh yeah, Mullins.
[00:46:38.097 --> 00:46:39.958]  I've interviewed him about that.
[00:46:39.958 --> 00:46:42.679]  He wrote a book detailing it all.
[00:46:42.679 --> 00:46:43.240]  That's right.
[00:46:44.316 --> 00:47:11.523]  It was sent to me this morning, the page, where the medical authorities admitted in the Boston Globe, which still exists, during the flu epidemic of 1918, that this had been an experiment with inoculations of men in the Navy who were in Boston who contracted this
[00:47:12.369 --> 00:47:15.371]  Well it's good for people to read that and I got it in the forecaster and
[00:47:31.661 --> 00:47:33.881]  You should pick it up for InfoWars, too.
[00:47:33.881 --> 00:47:35.482]  Yeah, as soon as it comes out, we'll have it posted.
[00:47:35.482 --> 00:47:39.222]  It again proves what evil, evil people these are.
[00:47:39.222 --> 00:47:44.663]  And what really makes me mad about this is my grandfather died in that epidemic.
[00:47:44.663 --> 00:47:46.084]  Oh, really?
[00:47:46.084 --> 00:47:49.804]  And my father barely lived.
[00:47:49.804 --> 00:48:00.426]  And of course, he lived on to produce me and ultimately get Parkinson's disease because of his survival and exposure.
[00:48:01.209 --> 00:48:04.830]  Well, so, being the offspring of my father, now you can understand why I am the way I am.
[00:48:31.561 --> 00:48:34.823]  Did your dad know about this?
[00:48:34.823 --> 00:48:37.124]  Did your dad know about this?
[00:48:37.124 --> 00:48:38.065]  Uh, no.
[00:48:38.065 --> 00:48:47.070]  No, he, uh, he spent, uh, oh, probably, uh, 25 years, uh, as a Parkinson, uh, victim.
[00:48:47.070 --> 00:48:52.753]  And it was on L-Dopa, uh, which, you know, had him out of his head half the time.
[00:48:52.753 --> 00:48:56.135]  And, uh, my mother's loving care kept him alive for years.
[00:48:56.135 --> 00:49:00.238]  She wouldn't allow him to be put into any kind of an institution.
[00:49:01.187 --> 00:49:06.229]  And it was just a wonderful act of love.
[00:49:06.229 --> 00:49:18.094]  But all of this should have never happened had our government not been doing what they were doing in the early 19s.
[00:49:18.094 --> 00:49:20.055]  So what are we saying here?
[00:49:20.055 --> 00:49:23.256]  Government has been up to this sort of thing for years and years and years.
[00:49:26.377 --> 00:49:26.858]  You're right.
[00:49:26.858 --> 00:49:34.586]  I mean, they've been caught over and over and over and over and over and over putting troops in chambers, nerve-gassing U.S.
[00:49:34.586 --> 00:49:42.094]  troops to death, putting out Homeland Security reports saying veterans are the number one threat and Homeland Security is really set up for you.
[00:49:42.094 --> 00:49:44.336]  We kept telling you that and now it's admitted.
[00:49:44.336 --> 00:49:45.898]  And that gun owners are bad.
[00:49:45.898 --> 00:49:48.000]  These are eugenicist criminals
[00:49:48.621 --> 00:49:50.863]  Who openly say they want to get rid of you.
[00:49:50.863 --> 00:49:53.185]  They've been caught with, you know, all the classic stuff.
[00:49:53.185 --> 00:49:54.667]  Tuskegee, all of it.
[00:49:54.667 --> 00:49:55.768]  When are we going to wake up?
[00:49:55.768 --> 00:50:00.672]  You know, that's why out of the gates we say this could be the government if they keep grandstanding and hyping.
[00:50:00.672 --> 00:50:05.217]  And even if it is just a mild flu, they're hyping it, using it to get control.
[00:50:05.217 --> 00:50:07.439]  And Bob, that's what I want to talk to you about in the final segment.
[00:50:08.581 --> 00:50:16.003]  Because the real news here for me is what this is causing as a distraction from horrible economic numbers.
[00:50:16.003 --> 00:50:23.145]  For those that don't know, the last quarter had a 4.9% annual expected drop.
[00:50:23.145 --> 00:50:25.666]  The last quarter now just came out today, 6.3% decline.
[00:50:29.546 --> 00:50:35.771]  In the last quarter, because this thing's always six months behind, so we're now getting it for the last quarter of last year.
[00:50:35.771 --> 00:50:37.212]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[00:50:37.212 --> 00:50:42.556]  China is basically dumping most its dollars right now to buy hard assets, gold, copper, and U.S.
[00:50:42.556 --> 00:50:44.338]  companies.
[00:50:44.338 --> 00:50:46.759]  So they're moving to dump the dollar.
[00:50:46.759 --> 00:50:49.722]  Just layoffs are exploding faster than we even thought.
[00:50:50.302 --> 00:50:52.963]  Meanwhile, nobody's even talking about that as we go into free fall.
[00:50:52.963 --> 00:50:54.724]  They're talking about this stupid flu.
[00:50:54.724 --> 00:50:59.847]  We'll do five minutes with Bob Chapman on the economy, then Larry Pratt pops in with draconian gun control news.
[00:50:59.847 --> 00:51:01.087]  Stay with us.
[00:51:01.087 --> 00:51:03.529]  Americans, do you know where your food comes from?
[00:51:03.529 --> 00:51:05.470]  Is it safe, secure, and healthy?
[00:51:05.470 --> 00:51:09.932]  Did you know most of our food is not contaminated with genetically modified ingredients?
[00:51:09.932 --> 00:51:18.236]  We at Baker Creek Heirloom Seed Company have been helping people get pure garden seed for 12 years and carry over 1,200 varieties of GMO-free heirloom seed.
[00:51:18.919 --> 00:51:22.740]  Go to www.rareseeds.com for more information.
[00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:24.821]  That's rareseeds.com.
[00:51:24.821 --> 00:51:29.883]  Baker Creek Heirloom Seed Company was started in 1998 by a 17-year-old as a hobby.
[00:51:29.883 --> 00:51:33.504]  It was developed out of a passion for preserving our vegetable heritage.
[00:51:33.504 --> 00:51:40.287]  The company now offers the largest selection of pure heirloom seeds strived every year to bring back varieties like our forefathers grew.
[00:51:40.287 --> 00:51:44.429]  In times like these, we can't trust the government to keep our seeds safe.
[00:51:44.429 --> 00:51:48.250]  Every year at Baker Creek, we work to preserve the best of the oldest for future gardeners.
[00:51:48.971 --> 00:51:52.632]  We also offer affordable seed collections for long-term storage.
[00:51:52.632 --> 00:51:58.055]  Go to www.rareseeds.com and get your seeds from America's pure seed source.
[00:51:58.055 --> 00:52:00.916]  That's rareseeds.com.
[00:52:00.916 --> 00:52:06.738]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:52:06.738 --> 00:52:13.721]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:52:14.309 --> 00:52:20.891]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:52:20.891 --> 00:52:22.871]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:52:22.871 --> 00:52:25.372]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:52:25.372 --> 00:52:36.934]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:52:36.934 --> 00:52:38.615]  It's not about left or right.
[00:52:38.615 --> 00:52:40.475]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:52:40.475 --> 00:52:43.036]  This film documents who Obama works for.
[00:52:43.638 --> 00:52:47.380]  The lies he has told and his real agenda.
[00:52:47.380 --> 00:52:55.645]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at Infowars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:52:55.645 --> 00:52:57.226]  The Obama Deception.
[00:52:57.226 --> 00:53:00.327]  The people strike back.
[00:53:00.327 --> 00:53:03.569]  Companies continue to lay off thousands of people.
[00:53:03.569 --> 00:53:06.891]  Unemployment is the highest it's been in over 30 years.
[00:53:06.891 --> 00:53:10.293]  Statistics prove that in a recession, crime rates go up
[00:53:10.655 --> 00:53:17.240]  Everyone needs something for that extra edge to prevent becoming a victim in these difficult and trying times.
[00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:22.464]  You need to prepare yourself with DPS pepper spray available at MrDefense.com.
[00:53:22.464 --> 00:53:29.169]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray in the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies from around the world.
[00:53:29.514 --> 00:53:30.575]  Need something more?
[00:53:30.575 --> 00:53:34.538]  The Scorpion Stun Gun is a great way to take down a potential attacker.

[00:54:13.144 --> 00:54:20.609]  Okay, Governor Rick Perry just minutes ago declared a swine flu state of disaster, an emergency in Texas.
[00:54:20.609 --> 00:54:25.972]  So, whether this is a real crisis or not, they are certainly using it and making it one.
[00:54:25.972 --> 00:54:40.721]  One death in Houston of a Mexican national, 23 months old boy, brought in to Brownsville, already sick, then brought in weeks ago, back on April 14th, he was brought to the hospital.
[00:54:42.034 --> 00:54:42.715]  We're good to go.
[00:55:09.286 --> 00:55:13.870]  And the state is just using this, and now we're not talking about the economy.
[00:55:13.870 --> 00:55:17.674]  So more details on this coming up in the next segment, then Larry Pratt pops in.
[00:55:17.674 --> 00:55:20.656]  In closing, Bob Chapman, TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[00:55:20.656 --> 00:55:22.818]  Our sites are Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:55:22.818 --> 00:55:25.661]  We'll link up to that latest report you put out as soon as you do.
[00:55:28.552 --> 00:55:30.933]  The economic numbers quickly coming in.
[00:55:30.933 --> 00:55:33.134]  Am I right to say this is worse than we were even thinking?
[00:55:33.134 --> 00:55:36.236]  I mean, this is an incredible last quarter decline of 6.3%.
[00:55:36.236 --> 00:55:40.157]  That is a massive plunge, is it not?
[00:55:40.157 --> 00:55:43.199]  Well, it matches up the fourth quarter of last year.
[00:55:43.199 --> 00:55:45.540]  And they were looking for 5%.
[00:55:45.540 --> 00:55:46.660]  And of course they didn't get it.
[00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:49.081]  That's a minus 5.
[00:55:49.081 --> 00:55:55.604]  And I thought that, quite frankly, we might get a minus, you know,
[00:55:56.314 --> 00:55:56.494]  I think?
[00:56:06.883 --> 00:56:09.004]  Toward the end of the year to perhaps minus four.
[00:56:38.004 --> 00:56:40.525]  Well, the answer is obvious.
[00:56:40.525 --> 00:56:43.786]  We are in depression.
[00:56:43.786 --> 00:56:49.389]  We went into depression around February the 1st after being in recession for two years.
[00:56:49.389 --> 00:56:51.230]  And now we're not talking about that, though.
[00:56:51.230 --> 00:56:52.651]  We're talking about the bird flu.
[00:56:52.651 --> 00:56:54.872]  We're talking about the pig flu.
[00:56:54.872 --> 00:56:55.552]  Well, that's right.
[00:56:55.552 --> 00:56:58.213]  This is the cover, which you've explained.
[00:56:58.213 --> 00:57:01.795]  This is to distract people and also to control them.
[00:57:01.795 --> 00:57:05.597]  And, of course, you know very well that Mr. Perry is
[00:57:06.972 --> 00:57:21.881]  Illuminist, and he's going to do whatever he's told to do in relation, and it's interesting that Texas happened to be the first state that calls this national emergency, and I'm sure that we'll have more of them.
[00:57:21.881 --> 00:57:26.324]  It is all just smoke and mirrors.
[00:57:26.324 --> 00:57:34.809]  It's to control Americans' thinking, it's to get them to take shots, make Mr. Rumsfeld richer, and the whole thing stinks.
[00:57:38.015 --> 00:57:40.016]  Absolutely.
[00:57:40.016 --> 00:57:43.056]  You're absolutely right.
[00:57:43.056 --> 00:57:46.937]  Again, this is a fast-moving news story here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:46.937 --> 00:57:53.679]  We're bringing you all the latest facets of this as it all unfolds.
[00:57:53.679 --> 00:57:56.880]  Bob Chapman, anything else?
[00:57:56.880 --> 00:58:06.182]  No, I expect the markets topping out again, and gold is up today, and that's good, and I think we're coming to the end of this
[00:58:07.469 --> 00:58:14.593]  I'll put correction in the market and I wouldn't be along the market except gold and silver stocks.
[00:58:14.593 --> 00:58:21.116]  We told our people who want to and can to short a number of issues.
[00:58:21.116 --> 00:58:24.278]  That means you would bet betting that they're going to go down.
[00:58:24.278 --> 00:58:27.860]  And I think this is another piece.
[00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:33.403]  This this flu epidemic, so to speak, is another piece of of action.
[00:58:34.178 --> 00:58:36.241]  By desperate people.
[00:58:36.241 --> 00:58:36.902]  Absolutely.
[00:58:36.902 --> 00:58:37.442]  We're after them.
[00:58:37.442 --> 00:58:38.123]  Mom, stay there.
[00:58:38.123 --> 00:58:39.345]  We gotta break.
[00:58:39.345 --> 00:58:43.170]  We gotta break.
[00:58:43.170 --> 00:58:45.674]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.674 --> 00:58:47.977]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.916 --> 00:58:52.598]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:52.598 --> 00:58:57.344]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:58:57.344 --> 00:59:00.308]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:59:00.308 --> 00:59:03.352]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:59:03.352 --> 00:59:09.200]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[00:59:09.420 --> 00:59:12.664]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:59:12.664 --> 00:59:19.672]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:59:19.672 --> 00:59:22.935]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[00:59:39.486 --> 00:59:40.087]  Take action today.
[00:59:40.087 --> 00:59:42.068]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:59:53.573 --> 00:59:55.954]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.954 --> 01:00:05.356]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.356 --> 01:00:06.656]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.656 --> 01:00:08.437]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.437 --> 01:00:10.197]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.197 --> 01:00:11.758]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.758 --> 01:00:13.318]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.318 --> 01:00:17.519]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.519 --> 01:00:19.860]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[01:00:20.755 --> 01:00:22.157]  Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.157 --> 01:00:31.509]  Okay, they're gonna have another press conference soon with Governor Rick Perry.
[01:00:31.509 --> 01:00:35.474]  We'll try to cover that and play that live.
[01:00:35.474 --> 01:00:37.737]  As that develops, I'll link to it up on InfoWars.com.
[01:00:39.284 --> 01:00:40.365]  News 8 Austin reporting.
[01:00:40.365 --> 01:00:46.773]  The governor has said that the state has enacted its pandemic flu plan through the division of the emergency management.
[01:00:46.773 --> 01:00:50.518]  Perry urged Texans to act responsibly and he'd advise from state officials.
[01:00:50.518 --> 01:00:54.543]  So they put out announcements to scare everybody but then say be calm.
[01:00:54.543 --> 01:00:55.604]  That way they get the fear monger.
[01:00:56.465 --> 01:01:00.271]  But then also play the part of the big daddy figure that's going to take good care of you.
[01:01:00.271 --> 01:01:01.873]  Rick Perry is a globalist.
[01:01:01.873 --> 01:01:08.302]  He went to Bilderberg Group and bragged about it even though it violated federal law to set policy internationally.
[01:01:08.302 --> 01:01:09.784]  They're saying two different
[01:01:10.834 --> 01:01:12.636]  There's just several hundred cases
[01:01:38.507 --> 01:01:42.210]  In Mexico, not the amount that they're talking about.
[01:01:42.210 --> 01:01:47.755]  And most of it, all of it is confined to Mexico City and the environs.
[01:01:47.755 --> 01:01:55.302]  And so, you know, again, it is just absolute foolishness.
[01:01:55.302 --> 01:01:57.043]  And of course, the people are going to fall for it.
[01:01:57.043 --> 01:01:57.664]  They always do.
[01:01:58.814 --> 01:02:02.657]  Well, that's my point, is that you get 15 to 35,000.
[01:02:02.657 --> 01:02:14.006]  People kept emailing me going, it's 36,000, CDC says, but I've read the medical reports and heard from doctors and others that they just exaggerate and, you know, people that die of old age, they call it flu, and it's really about 15,000.
[01:02:14.006 --> 01:02:19.871]  Fine, let's say, that makes my point even better, let's say 36,000 people die.
[01:02:19.871 --> 01:02:22.113]  36,000 people die a year in this country of flu, of 300 million.
[01:02:23.519 --> 01:02:34.391]  Okay, and it's usually dehydration because they, you know, they're in their house, they live alone generally, you know, they get sick, nobody's there to know they're sick, they can't drink any water for three or four days, and they die of dehydration.
[01:02:34.391 --> 01:02:35.613]  Now, you've got
[01:02:37.113 --> 01:02:39.315]  Close to 200 deaths, they're saying, in Mexico now.
[01:02:39.315 --> 01:02:42.058]  You know, you got one death in the U.S.
[01:02:42.058 --> 01:02:43.039]  that was from Mexico.
[01:02:43.039 --> 01:02:46.282]  This is out-of-control fear-mongering.
[01:02:46.282 --> 01:02:49.885]  Now, look at all the other angles here today of people that think it's something worse, and it could be.
[01:02:49.885 --> 01:02:55.951]  But regardless, their response to what the government says they know is going on is overblown and fear-mongering.
[01:02:55.951 --> 01:02:57.272]  Now, they know something we don't know.
[01:02:58.733 --> 01:03:06.439]  Maybe he's going to try to be more serious, but it's the track record of the government releasing deadly pathogens that we have to look at.
[01:03:06.439 --> 01:03:09.542]  Bob Chapman reporting to us with Contacts in Mexico.
[01:03:09.542 --> 01:03:10.943]  Thank you so much for popping in with us.
[01:03:11.974 --> 01:03:12.574]  Well, thank you.
[01:03:12.574 --> 01:03:13.454]  I'll see you on Friday.
[01:03:13.454 --> 01:03:13.734]  Bye-bye.
[01:03:13.734 --> 01:03:14.014]  All right.
[01:03:14.014 --> 01:03:15.155]  Take care, Bob Chapman.
[01:03:15.155 --> 01:03:17.235]  I want to bring up Rob Due now.
[01:03:17.235 --> 01:03:27.277]  Rob Due has one of his bandmates who works at a facility, and they, at 7 in the morning, delivered two truckloads of Tamiflu, but we're all hush-hush about it.
[01:03:27.277 --> 01:03:28.978]  Tell folks about that, Rob.
[01:03:28.978 --> 01:03:40.000]  Yeah, he gets in really early in the morning, and he was having his coffee, and he looks out the window, and he sees the cops pulling up, you know, and they're kind of cordoning everything off, and these two trucks come in.
[01:03:41.127 --> 01:03:41.627]  Back in 2011.
[01:04:00.026 --> 01:04:01.127]  At the facility that he works at.
[01:04:01.127 --> 01:04:02.887]  And what facility is that?
[01:04:02.887 --> 01:04:07.589]  He tests water, I guess, for the state.
[01:04:07.589 --> 01:04:08.530]  So it's a health department?
[01:04:08.530 --> 01:04:09.370]  Yeah.
[01:04:09.370 --> 01:04:11.211]  State health department or city?
[01:04:11.211 --> 01:04:13.151]  It's state.
[01:04:13.151 --> 01:04:14.812]  So the state health department here in Austin?
[01:04:14.812 --> 01:04:15.552]  Right, right.
[01:04:15.552 --> 01:04:18.214]  And they had two 18-wheelers full of camouflage?
[01:04:18.214 --> 01:04:19.034]  Tractor trailers, yeah.
[01:04:19.622 --> 01:04:24.044]  Which, by the way, mutates the virus and accelerates its mutation.
[01:04:24.044 --> 01:04:26.244]  We've had medical doctors on confirming that.
[01:04:26.244 --> 01:04:27.845]  The media admits it.
[01:04:27.845 --> 01:04:33.467]  And that's the state buying the Tamiflu from the private company that Rumsfeld, Bush, and Obama
[01:04:34.443 --> 01:04:36.604]  On Stockton, so right there they have a reason.
[01:04:36.604 --> 01:04:41.866]  Now they got General James Conway, Marine Corps Commandant, fear-mongering about it.
[01:04:41.866 --> 01:04:48.648]  By the way, they're doing a Latin American slash Marine takeover drill in Florida right now.
[01:04:48.648 --> 01:04:50.409]  That's in the news.
[01:04:50.409 --> 01:04:52.369]  Anything else your friend told you?
[01:04:52.369 --> 01:04:54.430]  That's about it.
[01:04:54.430 --> 01:04:56.671]  He said he's not taking anything.
[01:04:56.671 --> 01:04:59.572]  He's not going to take the vaccine, which I encourage.
[01:04:59.572 --> 01:05:00.272]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[01:05:01.348 --> 01:05:08.473]  Finally in the news this evening, it's being reported that cyber spies from Russia and China have now penetrated our power grid.
[01:05:08.473 --> 01:05:24.385]  Even as energy experts are reporting that each summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid, some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge, creating a cascade of power outages across the country, putting us all in the dark.
[01:05:24.685 --> 01:05:30.051]  Are you prepared for the next round of storm-related outages or government-created blackouts?
[01:05:30.051 --> 01:05:36.577]  Have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private supply of electrical power?
[01:05:36.577 --> 01:05:40.461]  If so, this will be the most important information you have ever heard.
[01:05:40.461 --> 01:05:43.163]  Solar-powered generators are finally available.
[01:05:43.163 --> 01:05:48.529]  They have no moving parts to wear out or break and require absolutely no gas whatsoever.
[01:05:48.829 --> 01:05:51.493]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:05:51.493 --> 01:05:53.735]  So go to MySolarBackup.com.
[01:05:53.735 --> 01:05:56.219]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[01:05:56.219 --> 01:06:01.626]  Check out MySolarBackup.com before you lose your power.
[01:06:01.626 --> 01:06:04.209]  In the New World Order's war against humanity.
[01:06:04.813 --> 01:06:07.437]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:06:07.437 --> 01:06:15.028]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:06:15.028 --> 01:06:21.177]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:06:21.597 --> 01:06:23.558]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:06:23.558 --> 01:06:26.060]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:06:26.060 --> 01:06:37.648]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:06:37.648 --> 01:06:39.329]  It's not about left or right.
[01:06:39.329 --> 01:06:41.190]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:06:41.190 --> 01:06:47.414]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:06:48.078 --> 01:06:56.347]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:06:56.347 --> 01:06:57.929]  The Obama Deception.
[01:06:57.929 --> 01:07:00.952]  The people strike back.
[01:07:00.952 --> 01:07:01.633]  You worry.
[01:07:01.633 --> 01:07:03.976]  If you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[01:07:03.976 --> 01:07:04.536]  Hi.
[01:07:04.536 --> 01:07:06.979]  Summer's coming and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[01:07:07.298 --> 01:07:11.839]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's a learning curve.
[01:07:11.839 --> 01:07:14.299]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[01:07:14.299 --> 01:07:17.660]  To speed it up, you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[01:07:17.660 --> 01:07:19.600]  Author Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:22.381]  Her Wild Food Knowledge Package is the crash course.
[01:07:22.381 --> 01:07:26.101]  The DVD gives you a three-hour overview of her world directly from her.
[01:07:26.101 --> 01:07:30.502]  The book gives you an in-depth reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need.
[01:07:30.502 --> 01:07:34.243]  And her Wild Cards are your portable summary and cheat sheet for your fieldwork.
[01:07:34.603 --> 01:07:40.929]  This three-pronged learning system will take you from spectator to scholar to gourmet survivalist in weeks, not years.
[01:07:40.929 --> 01:07:43.291]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal.
[01:07:43.291 --> 01:07:45.413]  She's my mom and I watched her do it.
[01:07:45.413 --> 01:07:50.077]  So go to upthefield.com or call 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[01:07:50.077 --> 01:07:50.978]  Start now.
[01:07:50.978 --> 01:07:52.699]  Knowledge is power.
[01:07:52.699 --> 01:07:53.700]  Better take action.
[01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:54.661]  I think a storm's coming.
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:04.823]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:04.823 --> 01:08:10.307]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:10.307 --> 01:08:22.898]  We've got in for one segment.
[01:08:22.898 --> 01:08:25.380]  This is Busy Man and I'm gonna get back into all the flu news.
[01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:30.841]  Texas declaring a state of emergency.
[01:08:30.841 --> 01:08:32.282]  The Feds have already declared one.
[01:08:32.282 --> 01:08:33.043]  The U.N.
[01:08:33.043 --> 01:08:42.630]  prepares to go to Level 5, which they can then implement forced inoculations and mass quarantines, lockdowns of cities, military checkpoints.
[01:08:42.630 --> 01:08:43.550]  That is coming up.
[01:08:43.550 --> 01:08:56.580]  Confirmed death of a Mexican national, 23-month-old toddler that traveled back on April 8th and got sick the 14th in Brownsville, traveled to Houston, died there.
[01:08:59.281 --> 01:09:00.783]  That is coming up.
[01:09:00.783 --> 01:09:10.112]  Then we have Dr. Leonard Horowitz coming up in 51 minutes with amazing research he's done.
[01:09:10.112 --> 01:09:16.059]  And then we have Steve Quayle popping in on the last hour on this Wednesday, the 29th day of April 2009.
[01:09:16.059 --> 01:09:17.220]  But listen to me very carefully.
[01:09:18.925 --> 01:09:21.987]  I've been saying this since Saturday in the emergency broadcast we did.
[01:09:21.987 --> 01:09:30.393]  This is being used as a giant political distraction that the country is now officially, according to The Economist magazine and others, in depression.
[01:09:30.393 --> 01:09:32.214]  Two quarters now of continual
[01:09:35.585 --> 01:09:46.949]  6.1 to 6.3 drop in the economy, Chinese beginning to dump the dollar, jobs being lost everywhere, and all anybody's talking about is Barack Obama and how he's saving us and how great he is.
[01:09:46.949 --> 01:09:50.310]  And oh look, they released a bunch of White House photos of our great dear leader.
[01:09:50.310 --> 01:10:01.373]  I was getting coffee in the break room with the TV on and had to take a double take as they were calling him just an amazing leader and a great leader and a great man and just how he's awe-inspiring and it was the anchor on CNN doing this.
[01:10:01.373 --> 01:10:02.954]  I thought I'd woken up in North Korea
[01:10:06.407 --> 01:10:11.149]  And now we're not talking about how he's protecting Bush on the torture memos and saying no investigation.
[01:10:11.149 --> 01:10:14.451]  Now we're not talking about all of his gun control.
[01:10:14.451 --> 01:10:17.693]  We cannot be distracted from their agenda.
[01:10:17.693 --> 01:10:23.335]  While we are busy looking at this, they're trying to get through their G20, handing over further U.S.
[01:10:23.335 --> 01:10:28.218]  authority and trillions of dollars to foreign offshore banks as they set up the quote, Bank of the World.
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:30.921]  They will pay our carbon taxes too.
[01:10:30.921 --> 01:10:37.563]  They're trying to pass the carbon tax bills to literally shut down our industry, tax and regulate every facet of our lives.
[01:10:37.563 --> 01:10:47.848]  It's all happening while this flu with one death of a Mexican national that came in here from Mexico City where they're all run down and sick because it's so toxic.
[01:10:47.848 --> 01:10:50.809]  That's why we got Larry Pratt here joining us.
[01:10:50.809 --> 01:10:52.330]  Headline from GunOwners.org.
[01:10:53.985 --> 01:11:07.137]  The second largest and the only real national pro-Second Amendment group who have documented that the NRA is actually a pro-gun control judoscope group controlling the good members of their organization.
[01:11:07.137 --> 01:11:09.540]  Obama pushing treaty to ban reloading.
[01:11:09.540 --> 01:11:11.401]  Even BB guns could be on the chopping block.
[01:11:12.591 --> 01:11:24.902]  Remember the UNIDIR July 7, 2001 meeting in New York where they said we want to ban all civilian ownership of firearms worldwide because it threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the state.
[01:11:24.902 --> 01:11:29.546]  Now under this treaty, and these are binding, that's what all the NAFTA and GATT and all of that is.
[01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:32.281]  We're under UNESCO.
[01:11:32.281 --> 01:11:32.941]  We're under U.N.
[01:11:32.941 --> 01:11:35.202]  control right now with this flu situation.
[01:11:35.202 --> 01:11:46.389]  It allows and says it's basically explosives manufacturing to have your own reloading, or to even have companies reloading, and you see the government now trying to block the army from selling the spent brass.
[01:11:46.389 --> 01:11:47.890]  All this is happening.
[01:11:47.890 --> 01:11:54.374]  Larry Pratt, joining us from Virginia, right outside D.C., the Director of Gun Owners of America.
[01:11:54.374 --> 01:11:55.515]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:11:55.515 --> 01:11:56.115]  Hi, Alex.
[01:11:56.115 --> 01:11:56.736]  Good to be with you.
[01:11:57.652 --> 01:12:06.279]  We can't allow ourselves to be distracted by this flu while they move with the carbon taxes, the attacks on the Second Amendment, you name it.
[01:12:06.279 --> 01:12:08.040]  Tell us what's happening, sir.
[01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:23.993]  Well, during the President's world apology tour, apologizing for all the terrible things the United States has done, he stopped off in Mexico and apologized for the United States causing Mexico's crime problem.
[01:12:25.606 --> 01:12:30.749]  This is kind of a favorite of the liberals and the anti-gunners.
[01:12:30.749 --> 01:12:33.210]  They like to do this sort of thing.
[01:12:33.210 --> 01:12:36.692]  They've done it for years, blaming Virginia for D.C.'
[01:12:36.672 --> 01:12:38.513]  's crime problem.
[01:12:38.513 --> 01:12:52.281]  And nobody asked the president or nobody asked the Mexican president, Calderon, well, if guns are the problem, how come Texas has so much lower crime rate than even right across the
[01:12:52.785 --> 01:12:55.987]  River from El Paso, where they hardly have any problem in Juarez.
[01:12:55.987 --> 01:12:58.689]  They had a terrible murder problem.
[01:12:58.689 --> 01:13:04.172]  It's truly an epidemic that makes the swine flu look like a walk in a park.
[01:13:04.172 --> 01:13:07.954]  Which may be, you know, comparatively what it really is.
[01:13:07.954 --> 01:13:20.222]  So, he said, in order to solve this terrible problem, I'm going to make sure that the Senate acts quickly on the Inter-American Gun Control Treaty.
[01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:26.021]  It's called SIFTA, and it's a Spanish language acronym.
[01:13:26.021 --> 01:13:34.603]  And the SIFTA treaty has been kicking around for quite a while, and as you said, it would require licenses for reloading ammunition.
[01:13:34.603 --> 01:13:42.905]  If you wanted to change the barrel on your gun, you'd be a manufacturer, hence you'd need to be licensed.
[01:13:42.905 --> 01:13:50.067]  Gun bans would be a fairly easy thing, and it could be done without, once the treaty
[01:13:50.800 --> 01:14:00.688]  Is ratified, all these things could be done and more without any kind of vote of Congress because the treaty would be viewed as law of the land.
[01:14:00.688 --> 01:14:11.077]  Therefore, kind of like Paul Begala said under the Clinton administration regarding executive orders, stroke of the pen, law of the land, kind of cool.
[01:14:11.077 --> 01:14:18.623]  Well, I think we got some strokes of the pen coming if this treaty ever does end up being ratified by the United States Senate.
[01:14:19.341 --> 01:14:21.683]  I think we can stop it.
[01:14:21.683 --> 01:14:33.590]  They need to get at least 65 votes, depends on how many Senators are actually there because there's a couple of vacant seats at the, well, one empty, one vacant.
[01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:48.100]  Depends on, among other things, will Governor Minnesota Pawlenty hold tight and refuse to affirm the election, which I think has been stolen so far by Acorn on behalf of
[01:14:50.138 --> 01:14:59.623]  Well, that was my next point, is that we now have Specter announcing he is going to become a Democrat.
[01:14:59.623 --> 01:15:02.705]  That's going to give them a filibuster proof in the Senate.
[01:15:02.705 --> 01:15:03.686]  They've got the House.
[01:15:04.286 --> 01:15:17.689]  And they can just ram through carbon taxes, amnesty plans, gun bans, and as you know, analyzing this draconian treaty, this is bigger and badder than what he's been asking for in H.R.
[01:15:17.689 --> 01:15:25.311]  45, what they've been pushing in the new expanded assault weapons ban, and so all the lies, all their disinfo about
[01:15:25.851 --> 01:15:26.971]  Stand down G.I.
[01:15:26.971 --> 01:15:31.813]  like Tokyo Rose in World War II saying we're not firing on you as they were firing.
[01:15:31.813 --> 01:15:34.334]  All these lies about we don't want your guns.
[01:15:34.334 --> 01:15:36.955]  This is the absolute proof.
[01:15:36.955 --> 01:15:40.216]  His gun banning, who wants a total gun ban for citizens, supported the D.C.
[01:15:40.216 --> 01:15:40.937]  gun ban.
[01:15:40.937 --> 01:15:44.558]  His gun banning Attorney General in Mexico, in Texas, in California.
[01:15:44.558 --> 01:15:48.499]  Constant speeches saying we've got to do something about this.
[01:15:48.499 --> 01:15:52.461]  Blaming the Mexican drug cartels and the victim disarmament culture down there.
[01:15:53.021 --> 01:15:56.845]  And their culture of corruption, blaming the United States for this is asinine.
[01:15:56.845 --> 01:15:59.808]  They always blame Indiana for Chicago, where they have a gun ban.
[01:15:59.808 --> 01:16:04.392]  They always blame upstate New York and New Jersey for New York City.
[01:16:04.392 --> 01:16:05.693]  You're absolutely right.
[01:16:05.693 --> 01:16:07.395]  And so now there's no debating.
[01:16:07.395 --> 01:16:15.182]  They are openly coming at the throat of all gun owners with something bigger than the 68 Gun Control Act, bigger than the...
[01:16:16.303 --> 01:16:18.624]  I mean, everything rolled together.
[01:16:18.624 --> 01:16:20.546]  All previous gun control rolled together.
[01:16:20.546 --> 01:16:33.754]  Here it is, manifesting, and they just keep saying, this is not an assault, this is not an assault, with that military tactic of lying and denying that you're assaulting while you're assaulting, just like tanks when they...
[01:16:34.835 --> 01:16:40.296]  Charge and emplacement, put out smoke to obscure themselves from artillery and mortars.
[01:16:40.296 --> 01:16:41.276]  That is all they're doing.
[01:16:41.276 --> 01:16:42.957]  Well, we got radar, folks.
[01:16:42.957 --> 01:16:44.417]  We're cutting right through the smoke.
[01:16:44.417 --> 01:16:48.198]  These bastards are coming at the heart of the Bill of Rights right now.
[01:16:48.198 --> 01:16:55.319]  The good news is that because it's a treaty, they would need a two-thirds vote, which ups the ante.
[01:16:55.319 --> 01:17:02.141]  And I think we can hold them, but the only way we're going to keep them from voting for the treaty is for
[01:17:02.816 --> 01:17:05.899]  The Senate to realize that we're watching them.
[01:17:05.899 --> 01:17:09.042]  We've gotten a couple of good votes so far in the Senate.
[01:17:09.042 --> 01:17:10.663]  We've talked about those.
[01:17:10.663 --> 01:17:11.484]  The D.C.
[01:17:11.484 --> 01:17:17.629]  gun ban was stuck pretty hard by an amendment to a measure in the Senate.
[01:17:17.629 --> 01:17:27.018]  And an Amtrak gun shipping prohibition was dumped again by something like 63 votes in the Senate.
[01:17:28.065 --> 01:17:36.729]  We've got almost 20 votes more than we need, assuming it is an up or down vote, which is the only way they're going to get a treaty through.
[01:17:36.729 --> 01:17:51.394]  And Larry, assuming Mexico doesn't totally collapse with its flu hysteria, emergency being declared in Texas, they can just say, hey, we're in an emergency, Congress, you've got to do this, same way they passed the Patriot Act, same way they pass all this stuff.
[01:17:51.394 --> 01:17:55.676]  The never let a good crisis go to waste is the
[01:17:56.178 --> 01:18:00.040]  Seems like the watchword of this administration, and so you're quite right.
[01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:04.201]  They will try to do anything they can to consolidate power.
[01:18:04.201 --> 01:18:05.902]  I have to admit, I was mistaken.
[01:18:05.902 --> 01:18:17.207]  I did not think that Obama, socialist, that I'm convinced that he is a Marxist to the core from his education, how could he be anything but?
[01:18:17.207 --> 01:18:23.950]  I did not think he would take the gun issue in his teeth and move as quickly and openly as he has been
[01:18:24.605 --> 01:18:32.130]  Because he runs a high risk of losing in the next congressional election his party's control of the Congress.
[01:18:32.130 --> 01:18:33.631]  Larry, they're going for broke.
[01:18:33.631 --> 01:18:34.712]  They're going for broke.
[01:18:34.712 --> 01:18:35.192]  Go ahead.
[01:18:35.192 --> 01:18:48.821]  And maybe they're kind of expecting that they're going to have an amnesty measure pass soon so they can get lots of heretofore illegal aliens legalized and registered to vote.
[01:18:48.821 --> 01:18:49.462]  Absolutely.
[01:18:49.462 --> 01:18:49.982]  No, you're right.
[01:18:49.982 --> 01:18:51.763]  That's what's happening, Larry.
[01:18:51.763 --> 01:18:53.825]  That's probably why
[01:18:54.383 --> 01:19:02.876]  They're willing to be so brazen and take this on and in your face because otherwise I can't see what they're thinking.
[01:19:02.876 --> 01:19:05.580]  They've already produced a pushback.
[01:19:05.580 --> 01:19:06.661]  There's no doubt about that.
[01:19:06.661 --> 01:19:10.247]  You can see it in gun store gun show sales.
[01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:16.705]  It's as if the manufacturers were making their product with boxes with wings on them.
[01:19:16.705 --> 01:19:19.708]  As soon as they hit the shelf, boing!
[01:19:19.708 --> 01:19:21.229]  And they're off in the air again.
[01:19:21.229 --> 01:19:29.277]  So, the American people are catching on and the market is responding.
[01:19:29.277 --> 01:19:30.057]  It's reacting.
[01:19:30.057 --> 01:19:32.820]  It's registering just how much we've caught on.
[01:19:33.174 --> 01:19:35.216]  I'll tell you what Larry, let's do one more five minute segment.
[01:19:35.216 --> 01:19:38.218]  We'll have you gone to 29 after because I want to plug Gun Owners of America.
[01:19:38.218 --> 01:19:41.922]  You know, every time you're on, I kept telling people last year, I said, they're coming for your guns.
[01:19:41.922 --> 01:19:44.484]  This is the only real gun group we've got.
[01:19:44.484 --> 01:19:45.405]  You better join.
[01:19:45.405 --> 01:19:46.245]  You better get involved.
[01:19:46.245 --> 01:19:48.167]  You better at least get their free updates.
[01:19:48.167 --> 01:19:50.729]  And I want to find out when we got back from you.
[01:19:50.729 --> 01:19:51.690]  Are people responding?
[01:19:51.690 --> 01:19:52.511]  Do they understand?
[01:19:52.511 --> 01:19:53.452]  This is it.
[01:19:53.452 --> 01:19:54.573]  This is it.
[01:19:54.573 --> 01:19:56.094]  We're not waiting for the new world order.
[01:19:56.094 --> 01:19:57.816]  It is attacking us now.
[01:19:57.816 --> 01:19:58.236]  Stay with us.
[01:19:58.236 --> 01:19:59.197]  We'll be right back with Larry Pratt.
[01:20:02.702 --> 01:20:04.204]  Recognize that sound?
[01:20:04.204 --> 01:20:08.988]  If you're taking vitamins and minerals in pill form, that's exactly where many are ending up.
[01:20:08.988 --> 01:20:11.451]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman.
[01:20:11.451 --> 01:20:16.776]  According to the physician's desk reference, vitamins in a pill form are 10% absorbed.
[01:20:16.776 --> 01:20:22.182]  So for every $100 you spend on vitamins, that's $90 you're flushing down the toilet.
[01:20:22.182 --> 01:20:25.245]  In fact, orderlies at hospitals call these bedpan bullets.
[01:20:25.265 --> 01:20:25.965]  We're good to go.
[01:20:50.070 --> 01:20:53.274]  Isn't it time you stop flushing your vitamins down the toilet?
[01:20:53.274 --> 01:20:54.435]  1-800-210-1922 Or go to orderchoose.com
[01:21:02.797 --> 01:21:04.259]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:21:04.259 --> 01:21:10.305]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:21:10.305 --> 01:21:11.126]  That's right.
[01:21:11.126 --> 01:21:13.969]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:21:13.969 --> 01:21:21.476]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:21:21.476 --> 01:21:24.960]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments
[01:21:25.322 --> 01:21:29.584]  Like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:21:29.584 --> 01:21:35.068]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:21:35.068 --> 01:21:40.871]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:40.871 --> 01:21:45.394]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[01:21:45.394 --> 01:21:45.634]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:50.722]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[01:21:50.722 --> 01:21:53.225]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:53.225 --> 01:21:54.766]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:54.766 --> 01:22:07.539]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:22:07.539 --> 01:22:08.660]  We've got to give them a stake.
[01:22:09.139 --> 01:22:13.402]  In creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:22:13.402 --> 01:22:19.886]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:22:19.886 --> 01:22:21.867]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:22:21.867 --> 01:22:24.329]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:22:24.329 --> 01:22:35.216]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:22:37.518 --> 01:22:39.179]  It's not about left or right.
[01:22:39.179 --> 01:22:41.040]  It's about a one world government.
[01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:47.945]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:22:47.945 --> 01:22:56.210]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:22:56.210 --> 01:22:57.791]  The Obama Deception.
[01:22:57.791 --> 01:22:58.972]  The people strike back.
[01:23:00.646 --> 01:23:04.168]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.

[01:24:00.003 --> 01:24:10.306]  Hi, Larry Pratt, Gunners of America.
[01:24:10.306 --> 01:24:17.148]  He's going to give us some other updates on a bunch of other state-level court rulings against the Second Amendment and other things that are happening.
[01:24:17.148 --> 01:24:23.850]  But I'm going to tell people something that's very important here and I want you to pay attention.
[01:24:23.850 --> 01:24:24.570]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:24:25.740 --> 01:24:30.352]  A year ago, I was telling you that the anti-gun forces had tripled the size of the BATF.
[01:24:30.352 --> 01:24:31.415]  They're not playing games.
[01:24:31.415 --> 01:24:32.719]  They're coming for the Second Amendment.
[01:24:35.290 --> 01:24:40.515]  And they're trying to pacify you with this Supreme Court ruling, while they just ignore it and move forward.
[01:24:40.515 --> 01:24:43.338]  And with this treaty, and the rest of it.
[01:24:43.338 --> 01:24:45.179]  You need to join Gun Owners of America.
[01:24:45.179 --> 01:24:53.247]  If you at least go sign up at gunowners.org, gunowners.org, for the free updates, and they've redesigned the site, it's gorgeous.
[01:24:53.247 --> 01:24:56.730]  But I suggest you call and get a yearly membership or a lifetime membership.
[01:24:56.730 --> 01:24:57.931]  They need your funds.
[01:24:57.931 --> 01:24:59.152]  I talk to them behind the scenes.
[01:24:59.813 --> 01:25:07.595]  You know, half the time I can't get Larry on because he's down at the hill, or his people are, or he's fighting to expose what's happening, and I'm telling you, he's standing alone.
[01:25:07.595 --> 01:25:10.656]  The NRA is a Judas Goat organization.
[01:25:10.656 --> 01:25:16.617]  You really think with a hundred and something million gun owners that we couldn't have our Second Amendment totally back if we moved?
[01:25:16.617 --> 01:25:17.757]  It's a Judas Goat group.
[01:25:17.757 --> 01:25:19.638]  We're not attacking NRA members.
[01:25:19.638 --> 01:25:20.158]  It's a fact.
[01:25:20.158 --> 01:25:21.138]  We have their documents.
[01:25:21.138 --> 01:25:23.358]  They pushed the Sixty-Eight Gun Control Act.
[01:25:23.358 --> 01:25:24.599]  You gotta join gun owners.
[01:25:24.599 --> 01:25:25.499]  How do folks do that, Larry?
[01:25:26.124 --> 01:25:28.585]  Well, they can do it at GunOwners.org.
[01:25:28.585 --> 01:25:43.770]  There's a place to not only get those updates, the free subscription for the updates that you were talking about, but you can join 20 bucks a year, 500 bucks life membership, do it over a period of time if you would like to do it that way, or you can call us toll-free, 888-886-GUNS.
[01:25:52.230 --> 01:25:55.953]  Well, you're all we've got, other than the people at the state level.
[01:25:55.953 --> 01:25:58.255]  And folks don't know the power of citizen lobbying.
[01:25:58.255 --> 01:26:08.964]  You know, back when the legislature was in session in 99, there's video of this, a JPFO local member runs in and goes, Alex, bring your camera out, there's bribery going on.
[01:26:08.964 --> 01:26:14.648]  And it turned out that the Ethics Commission said it was bribery, and that was the payoff going on in the hall.
[01:26:14.648 --> 01:26:19.973]  And that made such a scandal, they said they had the votes to pass basically shutting down the gun shows, private sales.
[01:26:20.473 --> 01:26:21.014]  Some other things.
[01:26:21.014 --> 01:26:31.942]  It failed because of that ending up in the paper and the video going viral on the web, but there was a few hundred of us there and we were the ones that stopped it.
[01:26:31.942 --> 01:26:40.069]  The NRA was actually bad-mouthing us in the Dallas Morning News, calling us extremists for being against the gun show shutting down the loophole.
[01:26:40.069 --> 01:26:42.010]  Thank you for mentioning the word extremist.
[01:26:42.010 --> 01:26:43.531]  I meant to begin by
[01:26:45.176 --> 01:26:52.200]  I just marvel at the audacity of the Secretary of Homeland Security to find that the only terrorist that I can figure out
[01:27:04.791 --> 01:27:32.878]  are anybody that uh... that that whole complex of issues pro-life pro-gun pro-limited government uh... veteran blah blah blah uh... those are all the people that had a tendency to vote against my boss uh... yep those are terrorists now these exploding muslims on jihad bass that's don't worry about that that's not a real terrorist problem but i we figured it out these guys are really amazing they uh... you know they know they're in a war and it's our side
[01:27:33.206 --> 01:27:42.564]  We've been kidding ourselves thinking we can make nice, we can make concessions, we can give things away, we can go and do other things instead of paying attention to politics.
[01:27:44.366 --> 01:27:46.227]  The other side doesn't play that way.
[01:27:46.227 --> 01:27:48.008]  They want it all.
[01:27:48.008 --> 01:27:50.829]  And if they can get it without shooting, they'll do it!
[01:27:50.829 --> 01:27:53.190]  That's what politics is all about for them.
[01:27:53.190 --> 01:27:58.952]  Well, Larry, 99% of the time, as you know, in history, you have a fascist or a communist ruling you.
[01:27:58.952 --> 01:28:07.356]  This is the nature of power, and we know the people running Washington, these international bankers and their commie workers, we know they want to take over everything.
[01:28:07.356 --> 01:28:09.457]  They want to micromanage our lives.
[01:28:09.457 --> 01:28:12.118]  What else is going on on the gun-grabber front in closing?
[01:28:13.018 --> 01:28:21.788]  Well, I was just amazed that our good buddy Bobby Rush, we've talked about him and his registration of guns bill HR 45.
[01:28:21.788 --> 01:28:27.814]  This guy went with a congressional delegation to Cuba, what about three weeks ago maybe?
[01:28:27.814 --> 01:28:28.655]  Maybe not even that long.
[01:28:29.306 --> 01:28:41.912]  And they were slobbering over the feet of the Castro Brothers, and what wonderful people they are, and Bobby Rush was saying how he would just be honored to have... Total gun bans, death camps, everything.
[01:28:41.912 --> 01:28:53.437]  And Castro Brothers used the previous government's gun registration list, the first full day in power, sent their thugs out, and they came back with one of two things.
[01:28:53.437 --> 01:28:56.638]  The registered gun, or the missing gun's owner.
[01:28:57.265 --> 01:29:06.580]  And they then proceeded to kill tens of, murder I should say precisely, tens of thousands of people in order to consolidate their power.
[01:29:06.580 --> 01:29:09.885]  Yeah, Cuba admits they killed 140 something thousand the first year.
[01:29:10.342 --> 01:29:12.964]  Well, that's the Bobby Rush Gun Bill.
[01:29:12.964 --> 01:29:16.185]  It's the Dictatorship Facilitation Bill.
[01:29:16.185 --> 01:29:22.309]  Registration has never solved a crime in Hawaii or Canada where handguns have been registered.
[01:29:22.309 --> 01:29:22.889]  They know that!
[01:29:22.889 --> 01:29:28.513]  They want their slaves disarmed and if they come for the guns, it's going to get nasty like we say in Texas, come and take them.
[01:29:28.513 --> 01:29:30.354]  Well, thank you for the update on this.
[01:29:30.354 --> 01:29:31.294]  We'll continue to get updates.
[01:29:31.294 --> 01:29:32.615]  Gunowners.org.
[01:29:32.615 --> 01:29:33.996]  Gunowners.org.
[01:29:33.996 --> 01:29:34.937]  Join now.
[01:29:34.937 --> 01:29:36.057]  Stop playing games.
[01:29:36.057 --> 01:29:36.738]  Give the number again.
[01:29:37.438 --> 01:29:42.281]  It's 888-888-6GUNS or just gunowners.org.
[01:29:42.281 --> 01:29:43.321]  Larry Pratt, God bless you.
[01:29:43.321 --> 01:29:44.522]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[01:29:44.522 --> 01:29:45.563]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:29:45.563 --> 01:29:46.503]  Great American.
[01:29:46.503 --> 01:29:48.024]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:29:48.024 --> 01:29:51.566]  We probably wouldn't have any Second Amendment without that guy.
[01:29:51.566 --> 01:29:52.947]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.947 --> 01:29:55.468]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.468 --> 01:29:58.170]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.664 --> 01:30:03.644]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:30:03.644 --> 01:30:10.606]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[01:30:10.606 --> 01:30:18.988]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:30:18.988 --> 01:30:24.729]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:30:24.909 --> 01:30:26.750]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:30:26.750 --> 01:30:28.912]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:30:28.912 --> 01:30:33.456]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:30:33.456 --> 01:30:35.698]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:30:35.698 --> 01:30:43.464]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[01:30:43.604 --> 01:30:47.806]  Order your two-month supply today by calling 866-295-5305.
[01:30:47.806 --> 01:30:51.707]  That's 866-295-5305.
[01:30:51.707 --> 01:30:54.728]  Or order online at HBextract.com.
[01:30:54.728 --> 01:30:58.890]  Heart and Body Extract, 866-295-5305.
[01:30:58.890 --> 01:31:01.711]  Or HBextract.com.
[01:31:01.711 --> 01:31:06.953]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:31:07.535 --> 01:31:15.097]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:31:15.097 --> 01:31:21.638]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:31:21.638 --> 01:31:23.658]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:31:23.658 --> 01:31:26.179]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:31:26.179 --> 01:31:37.121]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:31:37.739 --> 01:31:39.420]  It's not about left or right.
[01:31:39.420 --> 01:31:41.281]  It's about a one world government.
[01:31:41.281 --> 01:31:48.183]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:31:48.183 --> 01:31:56.447]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:31:56.447 --> 01:31:58.007]  The Obama Deception.
[01:31:58.007 --> 01:31:59.208]  The people strike back.
[01:32:02.153 --> 01:32:03.294]  You are a rebel.
[01:32:03.294 --> 01:32:04.055]  Admit it.
[01:32:04.055 --> 01:32:07.017]  You refuse to read the directions when assembling a new item.
[01:32:07.017 --> 01:32:09.399]  You won't ask for directions when you're lost.
[01:32:09.399 --> 01:32:13.342]  Once in a while, you drive in the carpool lane with only you in the car.
[01:32:13.342 --> 01:32:15.383]  Your neighbors call you a crackpot.
[01:32:15.383 --> 01:32:17.545]  And you can count your real friends on one hand.
[01:32:17.745 --> 01:32:18.846]  Well, join the club.
[01:32:18.846 --> 01:32:25.051]  Einstein failed math, quit school, and his rebel ideas led to some of the world's most amazing discoveries.
[01:32:25.051 --> 01:32:29.695]  Edison rebelled against the dark, failed over a thousand times, then invented the lightbulb.
[01:32:29.695 --> 01:32:34.458]  George Washington rebelled against an entire country and led the creation of a new one.
[01:32:34.458 --> 01:32:37.701]  Now, Alex Jones is working to save that very country.
[01:32:37.701 --> 01:32:39.242]  So go ahead, be a rebel.
[01:32:39.242 --> 01:32:42.064]  Put in a food supply from efoodsdirect.com.
[01:32:42.064 --> 01:32:44.987]  Everyone will realize you were not a nutcase after all.
[01:32:50.481 --> 01:32:50.842]  We're good.
[01:33:24.770 --> 01:33:27.091]  We're only 26 minutes, 27 minutes away.
[01:33:27.091 --> 01:33:32.432]  From Dr. Lynn Horowitz joining us.
[01:33:32.432 --> 01:33:42.614]  Hi, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:33:42.614 --> 01:33:44.235]  We're gonna go to your phone calls.
[01:33:44.235 --> 01:33:48.516]  Michael, Leo, Randy, Steve, Jim and others coming up here in a few minutes.
[01:33:48.516 --> 01:33:49.836]  I'm gonna recap all the latest.
[01:33:51.394 --> 01:33:57.139]  Swine flu, it's really a, it's been called manufactured flu, laboratory flu.
[01:33:57.139 --> 01:34:04.606]  Not just the mixes from all over the world, but where it came from, what hemisphere, what time of year, out of season.
[01:34:04.606 --> 01:34:07.769]  The globalist preparations for martial law.
[01:34:07.769 --> 01:34:08.770]  Is this a beta test?
[01:34:10.629 --> 01:34:14.975]  Are they going to release something else even more deadly if they think they can sell us on the police state?
[01:34:14.975 --> 01:34:18.400]  Why is Rick Perry declaring a state of emergency in Texas?
[01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:19.882]  Out of the gates, that's coming up.
[01:34:19.882 --> 01:34:26.612]  I do want to encourage listeners to continue with other issues, not to let them use this as a total distraction.
[01:34:27.389 --> 01:34:36.014]  Now, you can use this bird flu, swine flu, human flu, transmutation to wake people up and go, you know, the governments have manufactured bioweapons.
[01:34:36.014 --> 01:34:37.515]  They've said they want to use them on us.
[01:34:37.515 --> 01:34:43.839]  In fact, Paul Watson's working on a story at PrisonPlanet.com on this subject that is very, very important.
[01:34:43.839 --> 01:34:46.540]  In fact, it may be up right now.
[01:34:46.540 --> 01:34:46.940]  Let me check it.
[01:34:46.940 --> 01:34:48.121]  I know he's been working on it all morning.
[01:34:48.121 --> 01:34:50.342]  Is it a race-specific bioweapon?
[01:34:50.342 --> 01:34:53.364]  You can use the enemy's hype of this.
[01:34:53.364 --> 01:34:56.386]  Whether they manufactured it or not, they are certainly hyping it.
[01:34:57.321 --> 01:35:10.070]  You can use that to wake people up about the endgame for global enslavement, what their larger eugenics program is.
[01:35:10.070 --> 01:35:13.913]  That is the key here.
[01:35:13.913 --> 01:35:14.794]  Yes, he's got it up.
[01:35:14.794 --> 01:35:17.456]  Is swine flu a race-specific virus?
[01:35:17.456 --> 01:35:24.481]  Very important for people to see that, to educate them about the fact that regardless of this is or not, and we certainly hope not, this is the real issue.
[01:35:25.711 --> 01:35:39.398]  This is what the globalists are planning to release on us in their own words in the United Nations Biological Diversity Assessments, in Secretary of Defense Cohen's speech in 97, in Dick Cheney's Rebuilding America's Defense of September 20th, 2000 document.
[01:35:39.398 --> 01:35:53.425]  This is the crisis they're using to bring in the New World Order, the smokescreen for the gun control treaties, the smokescreen for the SDRs and the new global currency, the smokescreen for the dumping of the dollar.
[01:35:53.425 --> 01:35:54.586]  It's all happening right now.
[01:35:55.851 --> 01:36:01.034]  Peso, tumbles, swine flu may prompt Mexico to tap IMF.
[01:36:01.034 --> 01:36:03.355]  We're going to get to that coming up.
[01:36:03.355 --> 01:36:14.481]  But I do want to encourage listeners to not become distracted to the fact they're trying to pass a whole regimen of listing carbon, carbon dioxide as a deadly toxic waste, carcinogens they can tax.
[01:36:14.481 --> 01:36:16.202]  They say hundreds of things.
[01:36:16.202 --> 01:36:18.443]  Every facet of life, they're trying to pass that right now.
[01:36:19.531 --> 01:36:29.395]  They're trying to pass a treaty to massively ban reloading and license you individually to do it, to change anything on your rifle, license you, register all your guns.
[01:36:29.395 --> 01:36:30.255]  It's happening!
[01:36:30.255 --> 01:36:31.455]  They've introduced it!
[01:36:31.455 --> 01:36:33.036]  Obama's lobbying for it!
[01:36:34.229 --> 01:36:35.310]  The plunging economy.
[01:36:35.310 --> 01:36:37.553]  They're setting up the new bank of the world right now.
[01:36:37.553 --> 01:36:40.556]  China announced today they're going to dump more dollars.
[01:36:40.556 --> 01:36:43.960]  They're buying up all these US, European companies with their dollars.
[01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:50.648]  They're dumping them, not into other currencies, but into copper, gold, silver, and real assets and infrastructure.
[01:36:50.648 --> 01:36:51.549]  Shipping companies.
[01:36:52.029 --> 01:36:57.233]  Highway, toll road companies, the elites are dumping their fiat currency into snatching up the infrastructure.
[01:36:57.233 --> 01:36:58.834]  That's why you hear about privatization.
[01:36:58.834 --> 01:37:00.175]  It's not privatization.
[01:37:00.175 --> 01:37:09.643]  It's the government stuff we all paid for being given to them to still be managed by the government, but with taxes slapped on it to private interest.
[01:37:09.643 --> 01:37:11.124]  That's what the New World Order is.
[01:37:11.124 --> 01:37:17.529]  It's paying taxes to private global cartels that are bigger than governments.
[01:37:17.529 --> 01:37:19.551]  Walmart is the
[01:37:21.704 --> 01:37:26.926]  Seventh largest economy in the world, Walmart!
[01:37:26.926 --> 01:37:34.388]  Of the 100 biggest economies, 49 of them, last time I saw it in Forbes a couple years ago, I'm told it was growing.
[01:37:34.388 --> 01:37:36.228]  I got an email that said it was 50-something, but I haven't proven it.
[01:37:36.228 --> 01:37:41.810]  49 of the 100 biggest economies aren't governments!
[01:37:41.810 --> 01:37:48.132]  They're corporations, and they combine forces together, and that's called the New World Order.
[01:37:48.132 --> 01:37:51.153]  You understand, that's what the New World Order is, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:37:52.182 --> 01:37:56.664]  And so I'm telling you, keep buying the books and videos at InfoWars.com.
[01:37:56.664 --> 01:38:00.906]  Continue to support us, what we're doing here, so we can expand while all this is going on.
[01:38:00.906 --> 01:38:02.907]  The bandwidth charges are going up and up and up.
[01:38:02.907 --> 01:38:06.549]  InfoWars, Prison Planet, all of them are just exploding.
[01:38:08.919 --> 01:38:12.262]  The young people listening on the internet, watching the videos that we pay to stream.
[01:38:12.262 --> 01:38:14.464]  We need your financial support, so don't forget that.
[01:38:14.464 --> 01:38:16.705]  Get End Game Blueprint for Global Enslavement right now.
[01:38:16.705 --> 01:38:17.386]  It's so important.
[01:38:17.386 --> 01:38:18.587]  Everybody see that?
[01:38:18.587 --> 01:38:19.187]  It's so important.
[01:38:19.187 --> 01:38:24.712]  You give your neighbor the high-quality DVD, so they know who the globalists are, what their history is, what their master plan is.
[01:38:24.712 --> 01:38:27.134]  End Game Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:38:27.134 --> 01:38:30.236]  The Obama deception, so people know who this guy really works for.
[01:38:30.236 --> 01:38:33.699]  And now he's going to use crises to bring in world government.
[01:38:33.699 --> 01:38:34.880]  We say that at the end of the film.
[01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:35.280]  Look out!
[01:38:36.618 --> 01:38:39.360]  Get the DVDs at Infowars.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:39.460]  888-253-3139.
[01:38:39.460 --> 01:38:42.501]  Or write to me, Alex Jones at 3001, that's 3001, South Lamar Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[01:38:42.501 --> 01:38:44.202]  And don't forget PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:38:44.202 --> 01:38:48.005]  It's the quickest way to download in-game in high quality, TerrorStorm in high quality,
[01:39:02.850 --> 01:39:09.131]  Obama Deception, Truth Rising, Fabled Enemies, and iQuality, and burn them to DivX that plays on almost all the new DVD players.
[01:39:09.131 --> 01:39:16.292]  You can burn it on regular CDs for like twenty cents a piece that play on regular systems and give them to everybody!
[01:39:16.292 --> 01:39:17.273]  It's an info war!
[01:39:17.273 --> 01:39:29.235]  The people are now ready to wake up, but if we all just only care about ourselves and just hide out in our houses from what looks like hyped-up flu, that isn't the real threat.
[01:39:30.134 --> 01:39:36.721]  The threat is the martial law, the police state that they're quietly announcing and setting up all around us right now.
[01:39:36.721 --> 01:39:43.428]  Now, speaking of the economy, I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up, because he hasn't been up this week, to talk about this.
[01:39:43.428 --> 01:39:47.032]  A peso tumble swine flu may prompt Mexico to tap IMF Bloomberg.
[01:39:48.632 --> 01:39:58.660]  Mexico is more likely to draw on the $47 billion credit line for the International Monetary Fund after the deadly swine flu outbreak sparked the peso's biggest tumble in six months according to Barclays Capital.
[01:39:58.660 --> 01:40:00.642]  And those are SDRs.
[01:40:00.642 --> 01:40:06.006]  Imaginary fiat money the IMF and World Bank are issuing.
[01:40:06.006 --> 01:40:10.249]  And the IMF has been chosen, not the World Bank, to be the new bank of the world.
[01:40:10.249 --> 01:40:13.172]  And then it's backed up with your carbon taxes to these bastards.
[01:40:14.056 --> 01:40:16.858]  So they get the interest and the power, you pay for it.
[01:40:16.858 --> 01:40:20.760]  The peso sank 5.1% yesterday, biggest decline among all currencies.
[01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:26.383]  The dollar is dropping, gold and silver are exploding, but copper is just off the chart.
[01:40:27.913 --> 01:40:31.015]  IMF, again, approves $47 million credit line for Mexico.
[01:40:31.015 --> 01:40:32.597]  That's already happened.
[01:40:32.597 --> 01:40:38.201]  Governor Perry declares swine flu a state of disaster in Texas as they prepare for quarantines and forced inoculations.
[01:40:38.201 --> 01:40:42.524]  That's what happens when they go to level 5, and that's quietly being done right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:40:42.524 --> 01:40:44.526]  I want to bring Ted Anderson up.
[01:40:44.526 --> 01:40:47.388]  Ted, I've got the reports here in my stack.
[01:40:47.388 --> 01:40:54.893]  China is now dumping dollars en masse, snatching up gold, silver, copper, palladium.
[01:40:55.970 --> 01:41:03.014]  Platinum, timber stocks, road stocks, mining stocks, media stocks, military stocks, U.S.
[01:41:03.014 --> 01:41:03.935]  companies.
[01:41:03.935 --> 01:41:07.777]  They are just dumping, dumping, dumping, dumping.
[01:41:07.777 --> 01:41:10.479]  And this is just insane, Ted.
[01:41:10.479 --> 01:41:11.780]  You're right about that, Alex.
[01:41:11.780 --> 01:41:22.006]  China is the key player in the economic picture for the United States because China has been the largest financer of U.S.
[01:41:22.006 --> 01:41:24.908]  government security sales for about the last ten years.
[01:41:25.752 --> 01:41:31.880]  And China holds on to, I can't even, you know, it's like 3.3 trillion dollars worth of U.S.
[01:41:31.880 --> 01:41:32.861]  government securities.
[01:41:32.861 --> 01:41:38.989]  If they decided to dump that portfolio all at once, the United States dollar would be worth less than the Mexican peso.
[01:41:39.617 --> 01:41:42.659]  And you're watching the Mexican peso go down right now.
[01:41:42.659 --> 01:41:47.301]  I mean, it has a lot to do with, you know, people not traveling to that country.
[01:41:47.301 --> 01:41:49.502]  You know, a lot of trust.
[01:41:49.502 --> 01:41:54.565]  The European continent right now is looking at quarantining the United States.
[01:41:54.565 --> 01:41:56.646]  I mean, that's the type of things that are going on.
[01:41:56.646 --> 01:42:00.148]  Of course, this has huge economic consequences.
[01:42:00.148 --> 01:42:03.630]  And like you said, the United States dollar is tumbling right now.
[01:42:03.630 --> 01:42:05.811]  And gold is going up, and so is silver.
[01:42:05.811 --> 01:42:07.772]  And of course, that industrial metal, copper,
[01:42:08.411 --> 01:42:08.812]  I think so.
[01:42:31.465 --> 01:42:39.451]  I mean, this whole euphoric movement that happened on the stock market here recently can be wiped out so quickly, and we all know that.
[01:42:39.451 --> 01:42:47.717]  That's what I was about to say, is that, and people can go back to this, three months ago, two and a half months ago, when the market was down to 6,000-something, people said, what do I do?
[01:42:47.717 --> 01:42:50.920]  And I said, well, I'm not going to give you advice, but what I would do if I owned stock, which I don't.
[01:42:51.860 --> 01:42:52.100]  Yes.
[01:43:04.249 --> 01:43:10.114]  It's going to probably run up to eight or nine thousand again, and that's the time to get out.
[01:43:10.114 --> 01:43:12.236]  And then it may go down again and then back up again.
[01:43:12.236 --> 01:43:20.302]  But the point is, I would say now is the time, personally, to at least partially get out of the market before it goes back down again.
[01:43:20.302 --> 01:43:24.186]  Because, folks, they're already telling Americans not to come to Europe.
[01:43:24.186 --> 01:43:28.870]  They're already banning a lot of the food exports that we export, one of the few things we still have.
[01:43:28.870 --> 01:43:31.091]  This is already causing a lot of people to cancel trips.
[01:43:31.772 --> 01:43:36.595]  To the United States, and if this continues, the government continues to hype this up, and it just hit me, Ted.
[01:43:36.595 --> 01:43:37.856]  It just hit me.
[01:43:37.856 --> 01:43:59.351]  Remember how, when they wanted the Banker Takeover Act, known as the Bailout Act, October 3rd to pass, and Congress wouldn't pass it, they threatened them with physical martial law, Senator Inhofe and others on record, and we had some congressmen here on the show to confirm it, and they spoke on C-SPAN and the floor, that it was psychological terrorism, fear-mongering, saying, we're going to have a depression if you don't do this, and then it made the market
[01:44:00.168 --> 01:44:00.448]  I don't know.
[01:44:22.714 --> 01:44:25.255]  Well, I can tell you, Alex, I've been trading in the gold and silver market
[01:44:49.960 --> 01:44:51.081]  For 30 years.
[01:44:51.081 --> 01:44:59.988]  And I also, during that period of time, had a Series 7 license and I handled securities as well, including the stocks, bonds, CDs, annuities.
[01:44:59.988 --> 01:45:01.950]  I handled all that stuff.
[01:45:01.950 --> 01:45:11.217]  And I can tell you right now, there's a resistance level somewhere at 8200, right around that level on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
[01:45:11.217 --> 01:45:15.781]  And gold comes down to that 880 level and it bounces right back up again.
[01:45:15.781 --> 01:45:18.023]  Always, you know, just, I shouldn't say always, but
[01:45:18.672 --> 01:45:26.414]  Almost 100% of the time, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is falling in the fall of the year and up during the summer.
[01:45:26.414 --> 01:45:33.335]  And gold and silver is falling during the summertime, it's having its lowest point, and then comes racing right back up.
[01:45:33.335 --> 01:45:42.337]  By the time October comes, we have our October surprises, like the crash in 1997, and certainly a lot of things that happened here.
[01:45:42.337 --> 01:45:44.518]  The market right now is telling us that
[01:45:46.448 --> 01:45:51.890]  Things are very unstable, because gold and silver's up now in the spring, coming into the summer.
[01:45:51.890 --> 01:45:59.272]  The stock market is teetering right at this $8,100 Dow, and here you have China talking about dumping their U.S.
[01:45:59.272 --> 01:46:02.893]  government securities and getting away from the paper currency altogether, the U.S.
[01:46:02.893 --> 01:46:03.253]  dollar.
[01:46:03.493 --> 01:46:05.374]  Now is the time to move into gold and silver.
[01:46:05.374 --> 01:46:08.515]  That's what I personally believe in my heart.
[01:46:08.515 --> 01:46:10.776]  You know, if I had more capital, that's what I'd be doing right now.
[01:46:10.776 --> 01:46:12.176]  That's what I've been doing.
[01:46:12.176 --> 01:46:14.157]  Ladies and gentlemen, get into gold and silver now.
[01:46:14.157 --> 01:46:24.481]  Ted, I want to go to Karl's, but first, give folks the contact info to stop the procrastination and get into physical holdings of gold and silver.
[01:46:24.481 --> 01:46:24.801]  Well, 1-800-686-2237.
[01:46:24.801 --> 01:46:25.161]  Again, it's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:46:30.742 --> 01:46:31.842]  686-2237.
[01:46:31.842 --> 01:46:40.388]  And once again, Alex, I've been buying a lot of gold here at that $880 level, and I have things priced according to that point in the marketplace.
[01:46:40.388 --> 01:46:44.731]  And gold is over $900 an ounce, so now is the time to be getting involved.
[01:46:44.731 --> 01:46:47.072]  I mean, the Franks right now are at $214.
[01:46:47.072 --> 01:46:48.653]  They should be trading in the $221 level right now.
[01:46:50.375 --> 01:46:58.597]  I still have a good supply of those Lakota Silver Rounds, which people are just crazy over, which I think is great that people are getting silver in their hands.
[01:46:58.597 --> 01:47:02.959]  They're at $17.71, and just everything's moving up.
[01:47:02.959 --> 01:47:08.520]  And those are selling for literally $20 to $25 a piece on eBay and everywhere else, and people can't get them.
[01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:10.521]  You've got thousands of them.
[01:47:10.521 --> 01:47:10.821]  Again, 800-686-2237.
[01:47:10.821 --> 01:47:12.061]  What other coins do you have, Ted?
[01:47:12.061 --> 01:47:13.442]  Well, we also have U.S.
[01:47:13.442 --> 01:47:13.622]  Eagles.
[01:47:18.883 --> 01:47:21.784]  Just a very, very tiny supply of the Buffalo Coin.
[01:47:21.784 --> 01:47:25.866]  I have $20 Double Eagles.
[01:47:25.866 --> 01:47:27.807]  I've got $10 Gold Pieces.
[01:47:27.807 --> 01:47:32.229]  Probably, again, the best buy in the marketplace right now, however, is the Sovereign at $267.
[01:47:33.612 --> 01:47:35.494]  The Franks at 214.
[01:47:35.494 --> 01:47:37.936]  I picked up about 30 bags of Franklin halves.
[01:47:37.936 --> 01:47:41.960]  They're at $8.69 apiece.
[01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:42.500]  Okay.
[01:47:42.500 --> 01:47:42.780]  800-686-2237.
[01:47:42.780 --> 01:47:44.102]  You have the Franklin halves.
[01:47:44.102 --> 01:47:44.902]  That's a great deal.
[01:47:44.902 --> 01:47:45.003]  800-686-2237.
[01:47:45.003 --> 01:47:49.347]  And the brokers will be there until midnight tonight, Ted?
[01:47:49.347 --> 01:47:50.287]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[01:47:50.287 --> 01:47:52.429]  And if you want to place your order, just go ahead and call in.
[01:47:52.429 --> 01:47:55.312]  And even if you don't hit us at that time, leave a message.
[01:47:55.312 --> 01:47:56.373]  Let us know you did call.
[01:47:56.373 --> 01:47:59.516]  And I don't care if Silver's $15 an ounce tomorrow.
[01:47:59.924 --> 01:48:02.166]  And gold is sitting at $1,005.
[01:48:02.166 --> 01:48:03.568]  I'm still going to honor those prices.
[01:48:03.568 --> 01:48:03.928]  Alright, 800-686-2237.
[01:48:03.928 --> 01:48:03.988]  800-686-2237.
[01:48:03.988 --> 01:48:06.290]  Okay, thank you so much, Ted Anderson, for coming on with us.
[01:48:06.290 --> 01:48:07.171]  You're certainly welcome.
[01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:18.403]  Now listen, folks, we've got Dr. Len Horowitz coming up in about 15 minutes.
[01:48:18.403 --> 01:48:29.272]  We're going to start simulcasting right at the start of the hour at PrisonPlanet.tv, the radio show that then turns into a TV show the last two hours for PrisonPlanet.tv members and viewers.
[01:48:29.272 --> 01:48:40.882]  Dr. Len Horowitz is coming up with just incredible bombshell info, and we hope he's wrong about all this, but he was the guy that was right about the anthrax attacks being the government, and the FBI came to his house and threatened him.
[01:48:41.562 --> 01:48:55.369]  So that is coming up, just power-packed info, giving you the full spectrum analysis from people who think it's a hoax, to people who think it's real, to people who think it's in-between, but the government's using it as certainly as a way to take liberties and train us to take forced inoculations and the rest of it.
[01:48:55.369 --> 01:48:59.331]  We're covering it all, ladies and gentlemen, here today.
[01:49:00.071 --> 01:49:07.455]  Well, let's go ahead and talk to John in Ohio, who says he disagrees, so he goes ahead of the line, then Michael, Leo, Randy, Steve, and others.
[01:49:07.455 --> 01:49:08.755]  Go ahead, John.
[01:49:08.755 --> 01:49:10.736]  Yeah, uh, wait a minute or two.
[01:49:10.736 --> 01:49:28.145]  Of course, I can't really compete with you, but, uh, and you know I've been supporting most of what you've been saying and publicizing your work on national radio and the rest of it, but I'm really getting really disgusted that it's almost obsessive-compulsive that you pick a piggyback
[01:49:28.769 --> 01:49:33.477]  On the decades of marinated anti-communist propaganda and falsification.
[01:49:33.477 --> 01:49:34.999]  Nobody's going to question it.
[01:49:34.999 --> 01:49:40.748]  You get ahead in this society for promoting some of the most exaggerated distortions of what
[01:49:41.326 --> 01:49:47.430]  Of various forms of communism, of socialism, whether it's China, the former Soviet Union... Hey, John!
[01:49:47.430 --> 01:49:49.652]  Hold on, John.
[01:49:49.652 --> 01:49:55.876]  I explain that the big bankers use socialist systems to rob the public blind.
[01:49:55.876 --> 01:50:01.000]  So, and I mean, I call people liberals, I call them conservatives, just so they can understand what I'm talking about.
[01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.041]  I don't believe in the left-right paradigm.
[01:50:03.041 --> 01:50:08.285]  And let me guess, you're upset about Larry Pratt calling Obama a Marxist?
[01:50:09.045 --> 01:50:10.268]  That's part of it.
[01:50:10.268 --> 01:50:13.314]  Everything bad, everything evil is socialist or communist.
[01:50:13.314 --> 01:50:15.378]  It's an insult to people's intelligence.
[01:50:15.828 --> 01:50:18.269]  I heard the old takers say the same thing.
[01:50:18.269 --> 01:50:30.051]  Larry Preck, for instance, supported the genocide in Guatemala and said this is the kind of gun ownership we want is to have the death squad that they've got in Guatemala killing a quarter million people.
[01:50:30.051 --> 01:50:39.653]  You know, that was Rolling Stone Magazine, John, that he was saying we need citizens to be able to be armed in America just like the Contras.
[01:50:40.393 --> 01:50:45.678]  Look, I was sent a liberal video saying I supported McVeigh bombing OKC.
[01:50:45.678 --> 01:50:47.339]  I could sue that guy into oblivion.
[01:50:47.339 --> 01:50:48.680]  I said the government did it.
[01:50:48.680 --> 01:50:49.821]  McVeigh was a puppet.
[01:50:49.821 --> 01:50:52.023]  I mean, the left lies.
[01:50:52.023 --> 01:50:55.826]  Their foundation paid for, John, just like the controlled right.
[01:50:55.826 --> 01:50:58.409]  But, look, I appreciate your call.
[01:51:01.189 --> 01:51:03.370]  The world appears to be on the brink of collapse.
[01:51:03.370 --> 01:51:10.494]  Experts say a pinch of heirloom vegetable seed could soon be the most valuable resource on earth because it will provide healthy food now and every year after.
[01:51:10.494 --> 01:51:16.337]  Survivalistseeds.com now has the heirloom garden seed time capsule, allowing you to store your seeds for the future anywhere.
[01:51:16.477 --> 01:51:17.358]  Even underground.
[01:51:17.358 --> 01:51:29.808]  For 100 years, the Heirloom Garden Seed Time Capsule can withstand 3 tons of weight, is 100% rodent-proof, waterproof, and comes with a whopping 6,000 healthy vegetable seeds from 20 varieties that will grow anywhere in the USA.
[01:51:29.808 --> 01:51:36.374]  Unless you trust the government, the Heirloom Garden Seed Time Capsule and Heirloom Seeds from survivalistseeds.com is your long-term food solution.
[01:51:36.394 --> 01:51:37.935]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[01:52:05.154 --> 01:52:07.996]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:52:07.996 --> 01:52:13.880]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:52:13.880 --> 01:52:20.365]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:52:20.365 --> 01:52:22.366]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:52:22.366 --> 01:52:24.808]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:52:24.808 --> 01:52:34.555]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs
[01:52:35.017 --> 01:52:37.998]  That's fascism.
[01:52:37.998 --> 01:52:39.658]  It's not about left or right.
[01:52:39.658 --> 01:52:41.519]  It's about a one world government.
[01:52:41.519 --> 01:52:48.421]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:52:48.421 --> 01:52:56.683]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:52:56.683 --> 01:52:58.264]  The Obama Deception.
[01:52:58.264 --> 01:53:01.185]  The people strike back.
[01:53:01.185 --> 01:53:02.045]  Ah, springtime.
[01:53:02.483 --> 01:53:08.144]  Now that you've planted your organic garden, how will you keep the bugs away without using toxic chemicals and poisons?
[01:53:08.144 --> 01:53:12.625]  The answer is all natural insecticides from FreshwaterOrganics.com.
[01:53:12.625 --> 01:53:18.586]  These revolutionary insecticides start with the same organic product that we use in FPP to kill parasites.
[01:53:18.586 --> 01:53:26.888]  We then add a small amount of pyrethrin from chrysanthemum flowers and a mild attractant to offer you the most effective insecticide available anywhere.
[01:53:27.208 --> 01:53:30.192]  It can even be applied up to the day of harvest.
[01:53:30.192 --> 01:53:41.066]  Our natural insecticides work in the home, on plants, and in your garden, killing pests mechanically, not with poisons, so pests can't develop an immunity and they won't harm your children or pets.
[01:53:41.066 --> 01:53:44.470]  It's effective against white flies, moths, bedbugs, fleas,
[01:53:44.750 --> 01:53:45.170]  We're good to go.
[01:54:11.972 --> 01:54:28.308]  We've got Adderlyn Horowitz coming up at the start of the next hour.
[01:54:28.308 --> 01:54:31.311]  In fact, John, let's go ahead and get him on the horn.
[01:54:34.841 --> 01:54:36.521]  You don't want to miss this interview with Dr. Len Horowitz.
[01:54:36.521 --> 01:54:41.483]  We've got a bombshell video we did up on InfoWars.com on YouTube right now where he lays it out.
[01:54:41.483 --> 01:54:44.564]  And I'd roll my eyes.
[01:54:44.564 --> 01:54:50.005]  I've seen similar info put up by others, but we didn't post it because I don't know them.
[01:54:50.005 --> 01:54:57.967]  But I know Horowitz pegged the anthrax situation back in 2001 with total precision before anybody else did.
[01:54:57.967 --> 01:55:01.949]  So that's why I take what he's saying with a lot of credibility.
[01:55:01.949 --> 01:55:03.429]  And that is coming up.
[01:55:06.058 --> 01:55:07.959]  Right now, let's go to Michael in Missouri.
[01:55:07.959 --> 01:55:08.699]  Michael, you're on the air.
[01:55:08.699 --> 01:55:09.619]  Go ahead.
[01:55:09.619 --> 01:55:10.079]  Hi, Alex.
[01:55:10.079 --> 01:55:10.859]  Thanks for taking the call.
[01:55:10.859 --> 01:55:21.703]  I wanted to say a couple things locally, globally, and then to comment on the carbon taxes and the gun laws that are trying to be passed right now.
[01:55:21.703 --> 01:55:29.445]  I just wanted to remind people what another resistor to empire once said, is that an unjust law makes a just man a criminal.
[01:55:30.183 --> 01:55:33.424]  And that doesn't mean that you have to obey these laws when they pass them.
[01:55:33.424 --> 01:55:36.526]  If you're a just person, you can become a resistor.
[01:55:36.526 --> 01:55:40.027]  We're already criminals in their eyes, in a lot of ways.
[01:55:40.027 --> 01:55:41.968]  No, no, let me be clear.
[01:55:41.968 --> 01:55:44.069]  In fact, let me coin this now.
[01:55:44.069 --> 01:55:45.289]  Living is a crime.
[01:55:45.289 --> 01:55:47.990]  Being alive is a crime as a globalist.
[01:55:47.990 --> 01:55:58.815]  I saw like five more stories yesterday, I didn't even cover, where they're all over the news in major papers saying, we've got to cut our population by half and implement one-child policies to follow the carbon footprint.
[01:55:59.255 --> 01:56:00.416]  The water footprints.
[01:56:00.416 --> 01:56:02.517]  I mean, this is total tyranny.
[01:56:02.517 --> 01:56:04.257]  It's actually happening.
[01:56:04.257 --> 01:56:14.242]  So everybody, call everybody you know, tell them Dr. Lynn Horowitz is coming up right now, whether you're listening on AM, FM, shortwave, internet, satellite, you know, everybody's got computers, or almost everybody.
[01:56:14.242 --> 01:56:19.425]  Tell them to tune in right now at INFOWARS.com to Dr. Horowitz.
[01:56:19.425 --> 01:56:21.366]  What would happen if the millions of listeners we got
[01:56:21.846 --> 01:56:23.547]  Told somebody to tune in right now.
[01:56:23.547 --> 01:56:25.608]  We double our audience today.
[01:56:25.608 --> 01:56:27.909]  And a lot of days you can't get your friends or family to listen.
[01:56:27.909 --> 01:56:32.792]  Today, they might tune in and want to know what's really going on with this strange flu.
[01:56:32.792 --> 01:56:35.454]  So I can't wait to hear the full breakdown by Dr. Len Horowitz.
[01:56:43.183 --> 01:56:44.244]  I saw that in the news.
[01:57:04.895 --> 01:57:06.216]  This is not a city program.
[01:57:06.216 --> 01:57:07.056]  This is a federal program.
[01:57:07.056 --> 01:57:08.096]  Yeah, let me stop you.
[01:57:08.096 --> 01:57:10.017]  In Austin, it's a federal program.
[01:57:10.017 --> 01:57:14.159]  In Missouri, I did see the newspapers, Kansas City Star and others.
[01:57:14.159 --> 01:57:15.720]  These are not real warrants.
[01:57:15.720 --> 01:57:19.922]  The judge signs a blank court order to take blood at the side of the road.
[01:57:19.922 --> 01:57:21.202]  They have the cops do it.
[01:57:21.202 --> 01:57:22.943]  It's totally illegal.
[01:57:22.943 --> 01:57:29.526]  And now the feds are announcing, oh, we want DNA taken from everybody stopped at checkpoints with a tissue swab out of the cheek.
[01:57:30.186 --> 01:57:36.370]  So think of how, imagine if when we were kids they taught us in Nazi Germany they took blood at checkpoints.
[01:57:36.370 --> 01:57:41.794]  You'd go, those Nazis are in 1984, they only videotape you and check your papers.
[01:57:41.794 --> 01:57:44.956]  Can you imagine if they were taking blood from Winston Smith in 1984?
[01:57:46.809 --> 01:57:47.829]  This is beyond 1984.
[01:57:47.829 --> 01:57:50.170]  They just do it.
[01:57:50.170 --> 01:57:51.631]  The government is rogue.
[01:57:51.631 --> 01:57:52.931]  The government is criminal.
[01:57:52.931 --> 01:57:56.452]  And so you talked to your local rep and they said, hey, this is federal.
[01:57:56.452 --> 01:57:58.033]  Yeah, she said this was a federal program.
[01:57:58.033 --> 01:57:59.373]  And I said, is this DHS?
[01:57:59.373 --> 01:58:01.153]  She said, yes, it is Homeland Security.
[01:58:01.153 --> 01:58:04.615]  And then we also have FEMA facilities within the area.
[01:58:04.615 --> 01:58:05.815]  We have Weldon Springs.
[01:58:06.445 --> 01:58:12.366]  Uh, and I was curious why the federal program would be doing this here, and then I realized we're the home place of Boeing, Raytheon, and Monsanto.
[01:58:12.366 --> 01:58:13.226]  They're doing it everywhere.
[01:58:13.226 --> 01:58:17.487]  It is a federal grant to train you to go through checkpoints and have your blood taken.
[01:58:17.487 --> 01:58:18.347]  I appreciate your call.
[01:58:18.347 --> 01:58:19.387]  No, I mean, I know it's federal.
[01:58:19.387 --> 01:58:22.508]  I've had the police chief of Austin in here defending himself.
[01:58:22.508 --> 01:58:28.129]  The vampiric, uh, Arte Civetum.
[01:58:28.129 --> 01:58:29.929]  Oh, he is something else.
[01:58:29.929 --> 01:58:34.270]  But you know, the devil's pretty nice when he's standing next to you with his arm around you going, let's go out and get dinner, Alex.
[01:58:35.196 --> 01:58:42.123]  Probably Ace of Eight, I'd probably want to suck my blood behind the trash cans, you know, at the restaurant.
[01:58:42.123 --> 01:58:43.365]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:43.365 --> 01:58:47.088]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.189 --> 01:58:52.870]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:58:52.870 --> 01:58:57.611]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:58:57.611 --> 01:59:00.573]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:59:00.573 --> 01:59:03.614]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:59:03.614 --> 01:59:09.456]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[01:59:09.696 --> 01:59:12.939]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:59:12.939 --> 01:59:19.924]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:59:19.924 --> 01:59:23.207]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[01:59:40.355 --> 01:59:42.336]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:59:53.897 --> 01:59:56.278]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.278 --> 02:00:05.661]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.661 --> 02:00:06.982]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.982 --> 02:00:08.742]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.742 --> 02:00:10.503]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.503 --> 02:00:12.083]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.083 --> 02:00:13.024]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.024 --> 02:00:17.365]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.365 --> 02:00:21.887]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.420 --> 02:00:27.865]  It is Wednesday, the 29th day of April, 2009.
[02:00:27.865 --> 02:00:32.513]  We've got two hours left standing out before us.
[02:00:32.513 --> 02:00:33.875]  The Searcher, author...
[02:00:35.083 --> 02:00:37.464]  Steve Quayle joins us in T-minus 60 minutes.
[02:00:37.464 --> 02:00:41.065]  In the next hour, Dr. Len Horowitz joins us.
[02:00:41.065 --> 02:00:47.488]  He has an extremely informative 10-minute video that we have posted up at InfoWars.com right now.
[02:00:47.488 --> 02:00:53.390]  Dr. Horowitz, Anglo-American vaccine industry behind swine flu outbreak.
[02:00:53.390 --> 02:00:58.492]  Now, I want to be very clear about something about Dr. Horowitz.
[02:00:58.492 --> 02:00:59.953]  I remember in October of
[02:01:06.895 --> 02:01:13.618]  2001, seeing articles he put out at tetrahedron.org and other news sites that he has.
[02:01:13.618 --> 02:01:23.743]  He's an author, Harvard medical graduate, best-selling author, researcher, filmmaker, radio talk show host at that time on Genesis.
[02:01:23.743 --> 02:01:26.924]  This network came on before me, the hours before me in the morning.
[02:01:26.924 --> 02:01:31.686]  Very popular show, just got too busy with his practice to continue it.
[02:01:31.686 --> 02:01:32.487]  And I remember
[02:01:33.803 --> 02:01:39.066]  As people watch us live at PrisonPlanet.tv and then around the world on the web later when this gets posted to the Four Winds.
[02:01:39.066 --> 02:01:41.567]  In fact, we should probably pull that article up.
[02:01:41.567 --> 02:01:44.349]  Maybe he can remind me of the title of it.
[02:01:44.349 --> 02:01:49.171]  Or you can just Google Dr. Len Horowitz anthrax and then you'll find his original article from 2001.
[02:01:51.112 --> 02:02:09.620]  Laying out that it was weaponized, had to be Fort Detrick, Maryland, that had been coated in bentonite, that had little wings on it that they had with nanotech, that cost hundreds of millions of dollars of equipment, and that it was, you know, totally weaponized, and that these people were patsies, that they were claiming had done it, and that it was the government.
[02:02:09.620 --> 02:02:15.582]  And then it came out months and months later, like a year later, that the whole White House was on Cipro, the anthrax-fighting antibiotic.
[02:02:15.582 --> 02:02:17.763]  There it is, the CIA's role in the anthrax mailings.
[02:02:19.599 --> 02:02:23.883]  Could our spies be agents for military industrial sabotage, terrorism, and even population control?
[02:02:23.883 --> 02:02:31.069]  Special report expressly prepared for simultaneous publication in the Spectrum and Media Bypass.
[02:02:31.069 --> 02:02:33.511]  That's one of the early articles he did.
[02:02:33.511 --> 02:02:35.453]  Yeah, October 1st, 2001.
[02:02:35.453 --> 02:02:37.815]  Absolutely incredible.
[02:02:37.815 --> 02:02:39.896]  I mean, within days of it.
[02:02:39.896 --> 02:02:40.977]  Within hours, in fact.
[02:02:40.977 --> 02:02:45.742]  I mean, and I was saying, I go, I like Horowitz, but how does he, you know, come out and say all this?
[02:02:45.742 --> 02:02:47.203]  Because this is all he studies.
[02:02:48.516 --> 02:03:03.174]  Okay, it's kind of like I'm an expert on police state and martial law and covert operations, domestically, because I've been studying that that's how I woke up to their covert ops that are going on right underneath the surface of life, you know, here in daily life and the government drug dealing and the rest of it.
[02:03:03.174 --> 02:03:03.335]  So...
[02:03:05.526 --> 02:03:09.669]  He laid it all out and the FBI came to his house and threatened him and that was in the news.
[02:03:09.669 --> 02:03:11.950]  Saying he was maybe a suspect.
[02:03:11.950 --> 02:03:15.092]  Had nothing to do with Fort Detrick, nothing to do with government bioweapons.
[02:03:15.092 --> 02:03:22.696]  He was so close to them that they came after him and then months after he did all this, it came out.
[02:03:22.696 --> 02:03:23.977]  That he was right.
[02:03:23.977 --> 02:03:25.458]  The whole White House was on Cipro.
[02:03:25.458 --> 02:03:26.499]  AP admitted it.
[02:03:26.499 --> 02:03:28.200]  White House Press Secretary admitted it.
[02:03:28.200 --> 02:03:31.462]  They got on it September 10th, three and a half weeks before it showed up.
[02:03:31.462 --> 02:03:32.943]  Bush's enemies were mailed it.
[02:03:32.943 --> 02:03:33.963]  It was weaponized.
[02:03:33.963 --> 02:03:35.024]  It was miniaturized.
[02:03:36.297 --> 02:03:38.458]  It was the Ames Strain, Fort Detrick, Maryland.
[02:03:38.458 --> 02:03:41.398]  And now they've tried to burn three Patsy's and then killed another one.
[02:03:41.398 --> 02:03:44.199]  So we're going to first get him to recap.
[02:03:44.199 --> 02:03:51.801]  We come back from this break, we're going to break right now, Dr. Len Horowitz, this important introduction, that he's been very accurate on this in the past.
[02:03:51.801 --> 02:03:56.182]  And I made my own film about eugenics, End Game Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[02:03:57.771 --> 02:04:06.920]  And I've done a lot of research on eugenics, and I learned a lot from Dr. Horowitz, but as I did my research for a year and a half making that film, I found out how much of what he said was completely accurate.
[02:04:06.920 --> 02:04:10.483]  Because I'd hear this guy 10 years ago laying this out, and I said, maybe that's his interpretation.
[02:04:10.483 --> 02:04:11.725]  It's not that bad.
[02:04:11.725 --> 02:04:15.328]  No, it is that bad and worse, and so that's why we've got him here today, because...
[02:04:16.309 --> 02:04:34.658]  When I saw the video he made yesterday that's already viral on YouTube, the emergency release he did that's up on Infowars.com, I got very disquieted feeling because the way he was laying it out and breaking it out, and how many times, not just the anthrax situation, that he's been the first to lay it out accurately.
[02:04:34.658 --> 02:04:35.779]  That's what really concerns me.
[02:04:35.779 --> 02:04:37.040]  So, is it a hoax?
[02:04:37.040 --> 02:04:37.840]  Is it hype?
[02:04:37.840 --> 02:04:41.382]  Is the hype what we're seeing for the police state?
[02:04:41.382 --> 02:04:43.343]  Or is this the beginning of a beta test of
[02:04:44.744 --> 02:04:49.027]  How does it tie into Baxter shipping out the weaponized bird flu to be mixed with vaccines in Europe?
[02:04:49.027 --> 02:04:49.748]  It's all coming up.
[02:04:49.748 --> 02:04:52.590]  Our websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:04:52.590 --> 02:04:55.211]  Dr. Len Horowitz straight ahead after this break.
[02:04:55.211 --> 02:04:55.712]  Stay with us.
[02:05:01.598 --> 02:05:04.081]  Hi, this is Peter Kronschnabel with Midas Resources.
[02:05:04.081 --> 02:05:07.886]  As you know, government spending is at an all-time high and inflation is on the rise.
[02:05:07.886 --> 02:05:10.689]  What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially?
[02:05:10.689 --> 02:05:17.918]  As the economy continues to deteriorate due to corporate greed and government intervention, more people will lose their jobs and worse, their life savings.
[02:05:18.018 --> 02:05:23.121]  Having your hard-earned money in banks, the stock market, or any other paper asset is a lose-lose deal.
[02:05:23.121 --> 02:05:28.244]  You'll lose on your capital investment and you'll lose purchasing power as the dollar continues to devalue.
[02:05:28.244 --> 02:05:34.348]  One thing is certain, having physical possession of gold and silver will guarantee that no matter what happens, your investment will never be worthless.
[02:05:34.488 --> 02:05:38.630]  If you've been thinking about investing in the physical possession of precious metals, I can help.
[02:05:38.630 --> 02:05:44.434]  Call me today, Peter Kranchnobel, at 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[02:05:44.434 --> 02:05:49.477]  And I will take the time personally to put together a portfolio designed to protect what you've worked so hard for.
[02:05:49.477 --> 02:05:53.939]  Call Peter, 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[02:05:53.939 --> 02:05:56.581]  You've worked hard your whole life, and I want to work hard for you.
[02:05:56.581 --> 02:05:57.061]  Call 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[02:06:02.136 --> 02:06:07.396]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:06:08.167 --> 02:06:14.051]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:06:14.051 --> 02:06:20.535]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:06:20.535 --> 02:06:22.516]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:06:22.516 --> 02:06:24.997]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:06:24.997 --> 02:06:35.864]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:06:38.169 --> 02:06:39.830]  It's not about left or right.
[02:06:39.830 --> 02:06:41.692]  It's about a one world government.
[02:06:41.692 --> 02:06:48.597]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:06:48.597 --> 02:06:56.864]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:06:56.864 --> 02:06:58.445]  The Obama Deception.
[02:06:58.445 --> 02:06:59.646]  The people strike back.
[02:07:01.596 --> 02:07:06.119]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[02:07:06.119 --> 02:07:11.223]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:07:11.223 --> 02:07:12.724]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:07:12.724 --> 02:07:16.326]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?
[02:07:16.326 --> 02:07:21.750]  They're all natural and you'll save some 85% the money you're spending for your cleaning products now.
[02:07:21.750 --> 02:07:27.514]  Marty Schachter founded Calbin Soap Company in 1947 and provided products for health institutions.
[02:07:27.854 --> 02:07:30.355]  Now, Calvin Soaps are available to you and me.
[02:07:30.355 --> 02:07:32.896]  Triple concentrated for all your cleaning needs.

[02:07:36.518 --> 02:07:37.699]  No animal testing.
[02:07:37.699 --> 02:07:39.039]  I use them and love them.
[02:07:39.039 --> 02:07:40.920]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[02:07:40.920 --> 02:07:42.341]  And I say it big time.
[02:07:42.341 --> 02:07:44.042]  Call Calvin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.
[02:07:44.042 --> 02:07:44.402]  That's 1-800-340-7091.

[02:08:06.156 --> 02:08:07.457]  Big Brother.
[02:08:07.457 --> 02:08:09.239]  Mainstream media.
[02:08:09.239 --> 02:08:11.000]  Covering cover-ups.
[02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:12.562]  You want answers?
[02:08:12.562 --> 02:08:14.143]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:14.143 --> 02:08:18.326]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:18.326 --> 02:08:22.390]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:23.531 --> 02:08:27.016]  All right, for the next 52 minutes, we've got Dr. Len Horowitz.
[02:08:27.016 --> 02:08:31.922]  And we've got more time than in the YouTube video for him to really break down all the different facets of this.
[02:08:31.922 --> 02:08:39.452]  Dr. Leonard Horowitz is internationally now an authority in overlapping fields of public health, behavioral science, emerging diseases, and natural healing.
[02:08:39.452 --> 02:08:40.414]  In 99, he was voted
[02:08:40.954 --> 02:08:49.820]  Author of the year by the World Natural Health Association for his first national bestseller, Emerging Viruses, AIDS, Ebola, Nature or Accident or Intentional.
[02:08:49.820 --> 02:08:55.484]  2006 he was honored by the World Organization for Natural Medicine as the world's leading intellectual.
[02:08:55.484 --> 02:08:59.987]  Later that year he was honored for his global efforts to advance public health and vaccine risk awareness.
[02:09:00.367 --> 02:09:04.651]  By officials of the Sovereign Order, the Orthodox Knights Hospital of St.
[02:09:04.651 --> 02:09:05.992]  John of Jerusalem.
[02:09:05.992 --> 02:09:13.679]  Dr. Horwich received his doctorate from Tufts University School of Dental Medicine in 1977 as a student faculty member of Tufts.
[02:09:13.679 --> 02:09:22.568]  He taught medical and dental history, graduating with honors, and was awarded a research fellowship in behavioral science at Harvard University of Rochester.
[02:09:22.568 --> 02:09:24.850]  And he goes on and on and on.
[02:09:25.671 --> 02:09:43.631]  Uh, there, uh, later earned his Master's of Public Health degree from Harvard University, focused on behavioral science and media, persuasion technologies, Master's of Arts degree with health education, counseling psychology from, uh, Bacon College, uh, before joining the research faculty at Harvard School of Dental Medicine to study, um,
[02:09:44.372 --> 02:09:48.598]  A whole bunch of different issues and medical situations.
[02:09:48.598 --> 02:09:50.220]  He just goes on and on with his bio.
[02:09:50.220 --> 02:09:58.551]  I'm going to cut it off there and go via a video Skype connection as we're live here at PrisonPlanet.tv to Dr. Lynn Horowitz.
[02:09:58.551 --> 02:09:59.433]  Sir, can you recap
[02:09:59.853 --> 02:10:10.698]  What you broke down in the video that we've got up on Infowars.com and on your sites, tetrahedron.org and others, and then tie this into the overall strategic operation of the New World Order.
[02:10:10.698 --> 02:10:21.063]  And whether you think this flu is it, or a beta test for something larger that Napolitano chillingly said Sunday, is going to be coming on the heels of this.
[02:10:21.063 --> 02:10:22.324]  Very, very cryptic.
[02:10:22.324 --> 02:10:23.985]  Dr. Len Horowitz, thank you for joining us.
[02:10:24.875 --> 02:10:26.256]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:10:26.256 --> 02:10:33.820]  You know, it's really hard to say, but what tipped me off was it didn't make any sense that we had multiple strains, three different strains.
[02:10:33.820 --> 02:10:36.782]  We have the swine flu, the avian flu, and the Spanish flu.
[02:10:37.386 --> 02:10:43.771]  That was actually engineered in the laboratories down in Novavax, Bethesda.
[02:10:43.771 --> 02:10:46.633]  They had to get those strains from the CDC.
[02:10:46.633 --> 02:10:59.743]  They got them from England, and so I started to do some research, and you know, the skyrocketing stock values at Novavax, which produces the vaccine, really is a tip-off for me.
[02:10:59.743 --> 02:11:00.984]  You know, you follow the money.
[02:11:00.984 --> 02:11:02.305]  I know you do that very well.
[02:11:02.865 --> 02:11:10.388]  And it followed me to Dr. James Robertson, England's leading bioengineer of viruses for the vaccine industry.
[02:11:10.388 --> 02:11:15.110]  He's an avid promoter of US government funding for lucrative biodefense and
[02:11:15.854 --> 02:11:44.173]  uh... bio engineering contracts along with his collaborators at the cdc the whole thing smacks as a public relations ploy to sell a lot of vaccines which are very very deadly and that uh... essentially when you really look at what these people have done that before we even heard about this outbreak that is the day that we heard about actually the day that the mexican officials began to say that they may have some cases of this
[02:11:46.014 --> 02:12:11.074]  They had actually just that day virtually published in the Journal of Virology that this was what they were about in preclinical studies and so it's really absolutely ludicrous to think that this just happened by nature somehow an avian flu from Asia would combine with a swine flu from Mexico combined with a Spanish flu from
[02:12:12.054 --> 02:12:19.919]  1918 corpse and now suddenly gets into a human in any other way than the government manipulation is absolutely ludicrous.
[02:12:22.898 --> 02:12:37.853]  Dr. Horowitz, continue, break down these connections and now we see the Governor declaring emergency in Texas, the Fed's declaring emergency, they're admitting that the World Health Organization, the UN, is in control of our government's response.
[02:12:37.853 --> 02:12:41.196]  The Secretary General of the UN bragged about that to Mr. Moon yesterday.
[02:12:42.157 --> 02:12:56.647]  We have all of this right now coming together, and if you've just got a few deaths in Mexico, a couple hundred unless they're lying, one death in Houston, Texas, and the flu normally kills tens of thousands a year in the U.S.
[02:12:56.647 --> 02:13:08.975]  alone, just the regular flu, why are they hyping this then so much and closing schools and talking about bringing in literal martial law?
[02:13:08.975 --> 02:13:11.537]  What does your nose tell you from all your deep research on this?
[02:13:13.038 --> 02:13:20.261]  You know, I suspect strongly that they're pushing for the mandatory vaccinations which are going to cause the major depopulation.
[02:13:20.261 --> 02:13:28.404]  I think that the incriminating evidence and giving you some names, and I believe that these people should be really held to the burner.
[02:13:28.404 --> 02:13:31.586]  They really should be brought before some sort of a grand jury.
[02:13:31.986 --> 02:13:33.187]  The scientists at the U.S.
[02:13:33.187 --> 02:13:44.654]  Centers for Disease Control that are implicated through their collaborations with the organization called Novavax and the co-authors of publications that I've reviewed.
[02:13:44.654 --> 02:13:54.940]  The influenza branch director at the CDC, his name is Ruben O'Donis, and Dr. Rick Bright used to work for Donis at the CDC.
[02:13:54.940 --> 02:13:56.401]  He's now at Novavax.
[02:13:56.741 --> 02:14:01.844]  You know the revolving door there is between the drug industrialists and the government officials?
[02:14:01.844 --> 02:14:08.809]  Well that's the same thing that's happened here with Novavax's Vice President of Global Influenza Programs.
[02:14:08.809 --> 02:14:11.431]  He used to be working at the CDC.
[02:14:11.431 --> 02:14:17.835]  So there's this corporate governmental alliance here to commit what amounts to genocide.
[02:14:17.835 --> 02:14:20.517]  The mass killing of people for profit.
[02:14:20.517 --> 02:14:24.680]  There's additional conspiracy evidence when you really begin to go deeper.
[02:14:25.300 --> 02:14:26.622]  And you know what?
[02:14:26.622 --> 02:14:40.574]  I think the most hideous thing, when I say deeper, I want to talk about the genetic implications, the genetic associations of these vaccines associated with this particular outbreak.
[02:14:40.574 --> 02:14:50.864]  But I think that the most hideous reality, tragic reality that I've looked at is when you look at Dr. James Robertson's testimony before the World Health Organization
[02:14:51.264 --> 02:15:04.921]  Just a couple years ago, these people behind closed doors, these are the people by the way that are making the money from the vaccine sales and the technology for the genetic engineering to produce these germs in their labs.
[02:15:04.921 --> 02:15:09.447]  These people already decided behind closed doors that they would
[02:15:09.987 --> 02:15:17.172]  Inject or inoculate the population or spray the population, somehow seed these viruses.
[02:15:17.172 --> 02:15:19.934]  Exactly like you're looking at with this flu.
[02:15:19.934 --> 02:15:28.519]  A combination of Spanish flu, virtually all the feared, the most feared flus, they kind of like mix together into this cocktail flu.
[02:15:28.519 --> 02:15:29.760]  And that's what it is.
[02:15:29.760 --> 02:15:36.985]  And they said in their closed door meetings that they would be doing this, seeding actually the populations beforehand.
[02:15:36.985 --> 02:15:39.747]  They give the excuse or the rationale
[02:15:40.047 --> 02:15:40.687]  I think so.
[02:15:57.012 --> 02:16:02.136]  And so, you know, it flies in the face of ethical medicine.
[02:16:02.136 --> 02:16:07.501]  It flies in the face of public health because it's not really healthy.
[02:16:07.501 --> 02:16:18.930]  In fact, if you simply just looked at all the people you were creating in terms of phobic reactions, there are a lot of people who are on meds today that are depressed, that are fearful.
[02:16:18.930 --> 02:16:20.891]  They don't even go outside a lot of people.
[02:16:20.891 --> 02:16:22.433]  They don't want to touch each other.
[02:16:22.433 --> 02:16:24.174]  You know, they don't want to shake hands anymore.
[02:16:24.174 --> 02:16:24.714]  They're globic.
[02:16:25.855 --> 02:16:34.019]  The fact is that we've got a major public health problem being overlooked in what the induction and anxiety and depression in the population is.
[02:16:34.019 --> 02:16:35.640]  And, you know, it's insane, Alex.
[02:16:35.640 --> 02:16:36.820]  I know that you know that.
[02:16:36.820 --> 02:16:47.185]  So you're saying basically you believe this overalls a hype psyop and that the real action will be in the vaccine that they're rolling out to the people that they've now terrorized.
[02:16:47.185 --> 02:16:51.027]  And currently, the hype's also being used as a cover for the open
[02:16:51.527 --> 02:16:51.807]  Thank you.
[02:17:08.456 --> 02:17:10.238]  Yeah, I think that's very accurate.
[02:17:10.238 --> 02:17:11.579]  Yeah, I suspect straw.
[02:17:11.579 --> 02:17:13.861]  I mean, it's very, very clear right now.
[02:17:13.861 --> 02:17:23.611]  All of the most hideous plagues that we're witnessing from the cancer pandemics today to the chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, the autoimmune diseases, the whole array.
[02:17:23.611 --> 02:17:26.074]  I mean, we've done programs on this before.
[02:17:26.514 --> 02:17:32.140]  This is where the drug industrialists not only make money, but they also reduce the populations.
[02:17:32.140 --> 02:17:33.040]  It's control.
[02:17:33.040 --> 02:17:36.144]  That's why it's called Centers for Disease Control.
[02:17:36.144 --> 02:17:42.069]  It's not Centers for Disease Elimination, Remedial Action.
[02:17:42.069 --> 02:17:43.971]  They've even dropped the prevention.
[02:17:43.971 --> 02:17:45.433]  It's just called CDC today.
[02:17:47.256 --> 02:17:47.837]  Amazing.
[02:17:47.837 --> 02:17:56.285]  Now, Dr. Horowitz, I want to go back through, and you're not just saying that you have documentation behind everything you've been discussing with all the articles up on your site.
[02:17:56.285 --> 02:18:05.113]  If you just Google, though, mainstream news about the mixing of flus, they admit they've been mixing at literally hundreds of labs.
[02:18:05.894 --> 02:18:31.835]  Probably more than that, but hundreds per year that I've seen different bird flus, different swine flus with human flus, and then people like Baxter, thank God, got caught, Bloomberg reported it, mailing weaponized bird flu that if you get it, kills 90% of people, but it's not airborne yet, to mix it with regular spectrums of human flu, to mix all that RNA together, and to then have it given out as vaccines, and then
[02:18:32.475 --> 02:18:49.859]  Simultaneously all these homeless people start dying and it's in the London Telegraph and other papers that quote an unnamed biological firm at the very same time paid city workers cash to lie to the workers, to the homeless and others and tell them take this regular flu shot and it turned out they're dying of the bird flu.
[02:18:49.859 --> 02:18:51.460]  What is going on Dr. Horowitz?
[02:18:52.773 --> 02:19:13.473]  Well that's what you're saying is exactly what they're doing and so that now that we see this kind of a virus suddenly never in the history of humanity has this combination, a recombinant of the swine flu, the Spanish flu, the avian flu, plus they've got insect parts in it too by the way.
[02:19:13.473 --> 02:19:15.795]  This is a description of
[02:19:16.756 --> 02:19:20.279]  Totally diagnostic, it's called pathognomonic.
[02:19:20.279 --> 02:19:27.084]  It's a slam dunk, in other words, diagnosis that the virus came from Robertson's circle of friends.
[02:19:27.084 --> 02:19:34.029]  You know, and Robertson again is the chief head honcho in Europe, and this is a lot, it's all coming down from Europe.
[02:19:34.029 --> 02:19:45.678]  I'm sure that you've probably talked about on your show how CIA is directed by British Secret Service, the global industrialists, the military, medical, petrochemical, pharmaceutical cartel has its roots in
[02:19:46.178 --> 02:19:47.679]  Germany and England.
[02:19:47.679 --> 02:19:54.284]  So this is out of England that this particular virus came, or these combinations of technology produced them.
[02:19:54.284 --> 02:19:58.948]  And we've got Prince Philip saying he wants to come back as an antivirus to kill us.
[02:19:58.948 --> 02:19:59.909]  We'll come right back to you.
[02:20:01.567 --> 02:20:02.868]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:20:02.868 --> 02:20:08.472]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:20:08.472 --> 02:20:13.495]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:20:13.495 --> 02:20:19.058]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:20:19.058 --> 02:20:24.282]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:20:24.282 --> 02:20:26.163]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[02:20:26.587 --> 02:20:31.390]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:20:31.390 --> 02:20:32.511]  And here's the best part.
[02:20:32.511 --> 02:20:35.273]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:20:35.273 --> 02:20:39.196]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:20:39.196 --> 02:20:42.398]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:20:42.398 --> 02:20:44.620]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[02:20:44.620 --> 02:20:45.560]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:20:45.560 --> 02:20:45.960]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:20:45.960 --> 02:20:46.881]  Remember, in a real crisis,
[02:20:55.697 --> 02:20:58.238]  Non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:20:58.238 --> 02:21:01.840]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:21:01.840 --> 02:21:07.683]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:21:07.683 --> 02:21:14.626]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:21:15.245 --> 02:21:21.810]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:21:21.810 --> 02:21:23.811]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:21:23.811 --> 02:21:26.313]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:21:26.313 --> 02:21:37.882]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:21:37.882 --> 02:21:39.563]  It's not about left or right.
[02:21:39.563 --> 02:21:40.924]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:21:41.405 --> 02:21:48.311]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:21:48.311 --> 02:21:56.578]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:21:56.578 --> 02:21:58.160]  The Obama Deception.
[02:21:58.160 --> 02:21:59.341]  The people strike back.
[02:22:01.155 --> 02:22:03.377]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[02:22:03.377 --> 02:22:03.717]  April 29th, 2009.
[02:22:03.717 --> 02:22:04.698]  Gold open this morning at $898.
[02:22:04.698 --> 02:22:07.761]  A one ounce gold coin to be purchased for $924.12, $462.06 for a half ounce, or $231.03 for the quarter ounce.
[02:22:07.761 --> 02:22:08.342]  That's $924.12, $462.06, and $231.03.
[02:22:18.411 --> 02:22:31.122]  On June 4th, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110, was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[02:22:31.122 --> 02:22:34.345]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[02:22:34.345 --> 02:22:37.728]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[02:22:37.728 --> 02:22:40.611]  However, the Executive Order still stands unrepealed.
[02:22:40.851 --> 02:22:43.712]  Midas has the Kennedy vs. Fed document.
[02:22:43.712 --> 02:22:46.654]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:46.654 --> 02:22:48.955]  Unlike your liberty, the paper is free.
[02:22:48.955 --> 02:22:51.917]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:51.917 --> 02:22:55.678]  If you're interested in breaking the bondage of taxation and debt, call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:55.678 --> 02:22:55.858]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:23:01.341 --> 02:23:06.927]  As the economy continues to plummet, many of us will have to make difficult choices and cut back on our expenses.
[02:23:06.927 --> 02:23:09.890]  One thing we cannot afford to cut back on, though, is our health.
[02:23:09.890 --> 02:23:16.997]  If you suffer from chronic illness, stress, weak immune health, or just feel tired, you need to visit Shentrition.com.
[02:23:16.997 --> 02:23:20.741]  Shentrition is an innovative supplement that stimulates the healing power of the body.
[02:23:21.301 --> 02:23:23.342]  Shentrition is made up of two parts.
[02:23:23.342 --> 02:23:26.984]  The first part is superfoods, alkalizing greens and hemp protein.
[02:23:26.984 --> 02:23:31.447]  The second half contains a powerful herbal formula to heal and detoxify the body.
[02:23:31.447 --> 02:23:37.030]  The philosophy at Shentrition is to feed the body what it needs and heal the body with food in one product.

[02:23:47.415 --> 02:23:50.437]  That's S-H-E-N-T-R-I-T-I-O-N.
[02:23:50.837 --> 02:23:52.698]  Shentrition.com or call 1-866-497-7436.
[02:23:52.698 --> 02:23:53.158]  That's 1-866-497-7436 today.
[02:24:22.179 --> 02:24:24.204]  I just noticed my coffee cup has a little pin on it.
[02:24:26.449 --> 02:24:31.273]  Dr. Horowitz, from your research, this isn't coming from pigs, is what you're saying.
[02:24:31.273 --> 02:24:40.659]  All the other doctors and virologists we've talked to, and even people on CNN, generals, who are experts in bioweapons, are saying this was probably made in a lab.
[02:24:40.659 --> 02:24:42.761]  And then people email me going, what's your proof for that?
[02:24:42.761 --> 02:24:43.321]  What's your proof?
[02:24:43.321 --> 02:24:45.823]  Well, it's in the wrong hemisphere where it started.
[02:24:45.823 --> 02:24:48.105]  It's not during the flu season.
[02:24:48.105 --> 02:24:55.310]  I've been studying this for years, interviewing people like yourself and others, and folks have been saying the bird flu was engineered because it has these markers
[02:24:56.210 --> 02:24:57.592]  Can you explain that to people?
[02:24:57.592 --> 02:25:05.582]  I mean, recap the evidence of why this is a slam-dunk, as you and others are saying, that it is engineered.
[02:25:05.582 --> 02:25:08.346]  And then secondarily, is it race-specific?
[02:25:08.346 --> 02:25:12.931]  Because it looks like it's only killing Hispanics, including Hispanics in this country.
[02:25:12.931 --> 02:25:14.794]  And it seems it's making Hispanics more ill.
[02:25:16.834 --> 02:25:20.116]  Well, you know, I think that I'm getting more specific than that.
[02:25:20.116 --> 02:25:25.458]  I would like to put some people, indict some people, and put them on a witness stand.
[02:25:25.458 --> 02:25:26.659]  And I have those people.
[02:25:26.659 --> 02:25:33.822]  Those people, number one, are James Robertson and O'Donis at the CDC and Rick Bright at Novavax.
[02:25:33.822 --> 02:25:35.423]  And here's why I say that.
[02:25:35.423 --> 02:25:39.745]  Because no other group in the world takes H5N1
[02:25:41.426 --> 02:25:43.647]  Asian infected chickens.
[02:25:43.647 --> 02:25:45.208]  Brings them to Europe.
[02:25:45.208 --> 02:25:47.029]  Extracts their DNA.
[02:25:47.029 --> 02:25:55.233]  Combines proteins with H1N1 viruses from the 1918 Spanish flu isolate.
[02:25:55.233 --> 02:25:59.535]  Additionally mixes it in swine flu genes from pigs.
[02:25:59.535 --> 02:26:03.357]  Then reverse engineers them to infect humans.
[02:26:03.837 --> 02:26:07.059]  This is the only group in the world, Alex, that does that.
[02:26:07.059 --> 02:26:16.166]  These people should be brought before the American public, before the... Unfortunately, we can't trust the judicial system, that's why I suggest a grand jury.
[02:26:16.166 --> 02:26:28.675]  But the reality is the end product that Reuters and the officials are currently describing to describe this virus is pathognomonic, the mixture that these guys have been working on.
[02:26:28.675 --> 02:26:31.598]  Again, they publish, they put out their press releases,
[02:26:32.702 --> 02:26:43.115]  Basically at the exact time that this broke in Mexico, before we even heard about it, was the precise time that they started to release all of their promotional literature.
[02:26:43.115 --> 02:26:47.942]  Their stock went heavily from low to high as a result of this.
[02:26:48.422 --> 02:27:06.430]  This is just, to interrupt, this is just like 9-11 when we see record, all-time highs still, for short betting against United & American, not just airline stocks, United & American specifically, and then it led back to Alex Brown and to Buzzy Crongaard of the CIA.
[02:27:07.350 --> 02:27:09.333]  And then that investigation got shut down.
[02:27:09.333 --> 02:27:11.715]  So that's how you're fingering these guys.
[02:27:11.715 --> 02:27:16.141]  I've seen their names and I did notice the promotion in the last few weeks leading up to this.
[02:27:16.141 --> 02:27:25.492]  And then lo and behold, you go look at what they're developing and they admit that they're splicing all of the things that look just like this.
[02:27:25.492 --> 02:27:25.832]  How does
[02:27:27.294 --> 02:27:34.962]  Baxter, who they're saying is getting the World Health Organization contract to develop the vaccine, how do they tie in out of hundreds of companies?
[02:27:34.962 --> 02:27:44.873]  Why is the UN picking the one company, Dr. Horowitz, that specifically got caught in 18 countries ordering their subsidiaries to mix live bird flu with the vaccine stock?
[02:27:45.950 --> 02:27:47.832]  Well, again, look at Baxter's history.
[02:27:47.832 --> 02:27:50.895]  I mean, you're looking at IG Farben's prodigy here.
[02:27:50.895 --> 02:27:52.076]  You know, progeny.
[02:27:52.076 --> 02:28:00.905]  You know, it's the same old, same old that you and I have seen, and it's sad because, you know, Alex, I think we're getting to the end of this game.
[02:28:00.905 --> 02:28:02.447]  This is like, you know, endgame.
[02:28:02.867 --> 02:28:06.931]  You know, this is basically we've got the Emperor's new clothes.
[02:28:06.931 --> 02:28:10.114]  The Emperor is completely nude and people see it.
[02:28:10.114 --> 02:28:13.437]  People are screaming about it now more than ever before.
[02:28:13.437 --> 02:28:15.639]  And yet the parade just keeps marching along.
[02:28:15.639 --> 02:28:19.323]  The mainstream media keeps playing their deception.
[02:28:19.323 --> 02:28:23.027]  And really it's gotten to the point where we've got to do something.
[02:28:23.027 --> 02:28:24.688]  We do have a plan by the way.
[02:28:24.688 --> 02:28:25.629]  It's called Live H2O.
[02:28:26.650 --> 02:28:32.194]  Concert for the Living Water this coming June 19th to the 21st where we can make a big shift.
[02:28:32.194 --> 02:28:40.140]  We're looking at the need for that hundredth monkey in the parade, in the stands, where the parade is marching.
[02:28:40.140 --> 02:28:49.328]  If we can get about one out of a hundred people to start screaming like you've been screaming over the airways and I've been screaming all these years.
[02:28:49.328 --> 02:28:54.572]  You know, I think what we're going to have is this conspiracy of silence where we're afraid to speak up.
[02:28:54.572 --> 02:28:56.133]  The reality is if we don't,
[02:28:56.593 --> 02:29:00.174]  We may lose not just our lives but our children and our children's children.
[02:29:00.174 --> 02:29:06.296]  We've got 30 minutes left with you and I'll hold you five minutes into the next hour so we get a full hour of air time with you if you can do that.
[02:29:06.296 --> 02:29:11.918]  Dr. Horwitz, we'll have three more segments, long segment coming up, but specifically when we come back then, I'm just going to sit back
[02:29:12.438 --> 02:29:17.900]  We're going to show some of the documents and things that you have linked on your sites up on the TV screen.
[02:29:17.900 --> 02:29:20.441]  Radio listeners can't hear it, but later they can watch it on the web.
[02:29:20.441 --> 02:29:22.022]  But we're also live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:29:22.022 --> 02:29:24.963]  I want you to walk through like you do in your 10-minute YouTube video.
[02:29:24.963 --> 02:29:28.105]  We've got up at InfoWars.com, but you've got more time to add more data.
[02:29:29.105 --> 02:29:41.996]  What we're dealing with here, why you're pointing out this particular scientist and group of scientists and this particular company, because you did that before on the Anthrax and were absolutely dead on right.
[02:29:41.996 --> 02:29:47.440]  I mean, I thought you'd gone over the deep end, you know, back then to day one, say what it was and you were proven right.
[02:29:47.440 --> 02:29:49.021]  So I really respect what you have to say.
[02:29:49.021 --> 02:29:51.863]  Come right back to you.
[02:29:51.863 --> 02:29:53.245]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.245 --> 02:29:55.787]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.787 --> 02:29:58.469]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:03.081 --> 02:30:04.201]  Spring is here.
[02:30:04.201 --> 02:30:05.162]  Growing season.
[02:30:05.162 --> 02:30:07.362]  The economy is not getting any better.
[02:30:07.362 --> 02:30:09.063]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[02:30:09.063 --> 02:30:10.043]  Think about it.
[02:30:10.043 --> 02:30:14.145]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[02:30:14.145 --> 02:30:17.826]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[02:30:17.826 --> 02:30:20.647]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.
[02:30:20.647 --> 02:30:32.511]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.
[02:30:32.851 --> 02:30:33.292]  Let's do it!
[02:31:02.088 --> 02:31:08.115]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:31:08.115 --> 02:31:09.237]  We've got to give them a stake.
[02:31:09.733 --> 02:31:13.996]  In creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:31:13.996 --> 02:31:20.481]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:31:20.481 --> 02:31:22.483]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:31:22.483 --> 02:31:24.925]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:31:24.925 --> 02:31:35.813]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:31:38.115 --> 02:31:39.777]  It's not about left or right.
[02:31:39.777 --> 02:31:41.638]  It's about a one world government.
[02:31:41.638 --> 02:31:48.545]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:31:48.545 --> 02:31:56.812]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:31:56.812 --> 02:31:58.394]  The Obama Deception.
[02:31:58.394 --> 02:31:59.575]  The people strike back.
[02:32:01.673 --> 02:32:05.195]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:32:05.195 --> 02:32:10.579]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[02:32:10.579 --> 02:32:15.542]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[02:32:15.542 --> 02:32:26.529]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus.
[02:32:26.809 --> 02:32:32.552]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[02:32:32.552 --> 02:32:38.775]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[02:32:38.775 --> 02:32:39.656]  What about you?
[02:32:39.656 --> 02:32:41.577]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally.

[02:33:09.602 --> 02:33:14.306]  We will take a few calls for Dr. Horowitz, but I want simple, straightforward, quick questions.
[02:33:14.306 --> 02:33:18.209]  So, John, go through those calls and see who's for the guest, and we'll open the phones up for everybody else.
[02:33:18.209 --> 02:33:18.810]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:33:18.810 --> 02:33:19.010]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:33:19.010 --> 02:33:25.435]  We'll have more of this until about five minutes into the next hour.
[02:33:25.435 --> 02:33:29.659]  I want to have him back up later in the week if he can, because so much is happening.
[02:33:29.659 --> 02:33:32.021]  tetrahedron.org, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:33:32.021 --> 02:33:33.102]  Just Google Dr. Len Horowitz.
[02:33:33.102 --> 02:33:36.545]  He's got a bunch of sites, books, best-selling author, doctor, researcher.
[02:33:37.085 --> 02:33:37.725]  We're good to go.
[02:33:53.416 --> 02:34:02.588]  You know, it was like, here's who did it, here's how they did it, Fort Detrick, weaponized, this is all a lie, you know, and then it freaked him out so bad, the FBI came after you.
[02:34:02.588 --> 02:34:07.234]  Briefly recap that story before you get into your evidence on this one.
[02:34:08.697 --> 02:34:24.463]  Well, it's actually Battelle Memorial Institute, West Jefferson, Ohio, and how I was able to determine that was the primary source for the anthrax is because there was a lot of evidence that suggested that they were the only ones who had the capability, the technology to produce
[02:34:25.163 --> 02:34:39.993]  Not only a hyper-weaponized strain of anthrax, it was silica cut, it would spread, it was electromagnetized, it was hyper-concentrated, and there was only one laboratory really in the world, and it wasn't at Fort Dedrick.
[02:34:40.393 --> 02:34:42.374]  Fort Detrick received it from them.
[02:34:42.374 --> 02:34:48.718]  There was only one lab in the world that had the capacity to test that and to produce it.
[02:34:48.718 --> 02:34:53.561]  It was at Battelle Memorial Institute and the aerosolized laboratories.
[02:34:53.561 --> 02:35:06.710]  And so that's how I was able to actually, one week before the first anthrax mailing was announced to the press, I actually marched into the FBI headquarters in Northern Idaho because I saw the whole thing unfolding.
[02:35:07.190 --> 02:35:11.152]  You know, when I saw... That's right, now I remember, I remember, that's why I thought you'd gone crazy.
[02:35:11.152 --> 02:35:12.972]  That's right, because I haven't re-read this in years.
[02:35:12.972 --> 02:35:13.873]  That's right, it's here.
[02:35:13.873 --> 02:35:21.156]  You came out before it happened and went into their headquarters and you were on Genesis warning everybody and I'm like, what's he doing talking about anthrax?
[02:35:21.156 --> 02:35:21.796]  Please continue.
[02:35:22.762 --> 02:35:24.343]  Yeah, that's exactly right.
[02:35:24.343 --> 02:35:30.066]  And so, you know, the FBI never responded until about six months later.
[02:35:30.066 --> 02:35:32.507]  Afterwards, you know, and I kept hounding them.
[02:35:32.507 --> 02:35:34.588]  And I met, I was banging everybody.
[02:35:34.588 --> 02:35:40.952]  Mueller, you know, FBI Director Mueller on down for negligence and official malfeasance.
[02:35:40.952 --> 02:35:44.934]  Of course, the CIA was basically suppressing all of that.
[02:35:44.934 --> 02:35:47.015]  I saw... Well, how did you know it was coming?
[02:35:47.015 --> 02:35:52.078]  I mean, sure, it's one thing when it breaks within a day to come out and finger the right people, but how did you beforehand know?
[02:35:53.308 --> 02:36:02.293]  Well, because I had just, in June of 2001, I published the book, Death in the Air, Globalism, Terrorism, and Toxic Warfare.
[02:36:02.293 --> 02:36:07.837]  Nobody before September 11th, very few people, there was Steve Quayle, who you're going to have as a guest soon.
[02:36:07.837 --> 02:36:16.042]  Steve and I were virtually the only people out there saying that we've got some major bioterrorism happening, white collar bioterrorism by our own government.
[02:36:16.602 --> 02:36:25.350]  And so, you know, I had actually done all the questions, looked at all the questions of what they were doing, aerosolized sprays.
[02:36:25.350 --> 02:36:28.653]  And anthrax I had been studying for about three years.
[02:36:28.653 --> 02:36:38.542]  And so when I saw Peter Jennings on the evening news say, this was two weeks after September 11th, he said, tomorrow we're going to cover anthrax.
[02:36:38.942 --> 02:36:43.145]  We're going through your fears one by one, day by day.
[02:36:43.145 --> 02:36:44.226]  Good night!
[02:36:44.226 --> 02:36:46.428]  I said, oh man, I gotta watch this program.
[02:36:46.428 --> 02:36:50.651]  So I put it on and it was a commercial for Bear Cipro.
[02:36:50.651 --> 02:36:54.534]  And I go, holy smoke, Bear Corporation is IG Farben.
[02:36:54.534 --> 02:37:04.202]  It was the basis for the Germany's and the Holocaust manipulation of the populations and the intoxications that have come out of Nazi Germany experimentation.
[02:37:04.202 --> 02:37:06.304]  And they knowingly, as you know, for those that don't know,
[02:37:06.704 --> 02:37:07.585]  That's exactly right.
[02:37:07.585 --> 02:37:10.666]  And so that's how I was able to, you know, get that.
[02:37:10.666 --> 02:37:12.247]  And then this particular case,
[02:37:28.877 --> 02:37:31.121]  Really, Alex, it's a no-brainer.
[02:37:31.121 --> 02:37:33.845]  You know, you have to ask a couple questions.
[02:37:33.845 --> 02:37:42.238]  Number one, what would be the statistical probability for this kind of a virus to not be a laboratory creation?
[02:37:42.952 --> 02:38:04.346]  You've got to ask yourself, how is it that an Asian chicken virus could come up with a Spanish flu virus, could come from 1918, mind you, couple that with a swine and couple that with a reverse engineering for humans with a little bit of insect part and European virus engaged.
[02:38:04.346 --> 02:38:09.109]  And you've got to ask, well, what's the probability then that that would happen by nature or
[02:38:10.089 --> 02:38:15.134]  You know, synchronicity or serendipity.
[02:38:15.134 --> 02:38:16.795]  And you can't even go there.
[02:38:16.795 --> 02:38:18.777]  It's ridiculously remote.
[02:38:18.777 --> 02:38:19.998]  What's the opposite?
[02:38:19.998 --> 02:38:34.771]  The opposite, well, what is the likelihood that Dr. James Robertson and his group of the most powerful people in the world in biological weapons research and development and vaccinations, and specifically flu,
[02:38:35.692 --> 02:38:45.035]  When you talk about flu, when you talk about bio-preparedness for influenza and these types of viruses, you must go to Robertson.
[02:38:45.035 --> 02:38:50.477]  He is the gatekeeper for the multi-billion dollar vaccine stockpiling deals.
[02:38:50.477 --> 02:38:55.399]  He's got the influence over the European Medicines Agency, the EMEA.
[02:38:55.399 --> 02:38:58.140]  It's a quasi-corporate, quasi-scientific
[02:38:58.740 --> 02:38:59.360]  Uh, Dr. Horowitz, uh,
[02:39:23.936 --> 02:39:28.498]  Let's go back through some more of the evidence you've been breaking down in the articles and videos you've been putting up.
[02:39:28.498 --> 02:39:40.444]  But first I want to just ask you, someone who's been in-depth like nobody else researching this and from a medical perspective and talking to all the world experts, how bad is this flu from the preliminary info we have?
[02:39:40.444 --> 02:39:52.411]  One dead person in Houston, a 23-month-old baby, toddler, but he was in Mexico City and then brought up 15 days ago up into Brownsville and then
[02:39:53.271 --> 02:39:54.711]  Uh, to Houston.
[02:39:54.711 --> 02:39:56.252]  So is this race specific?
[02:39:56.252 --> 02:39:58.512]  Is it only continues to kill Hispanics?
[02:39:58.512 --> 02:40:02.673]  Or is it just that it's been incubating longer and there's been more cases in Mexico?
[02:40:02.673 --> 02:40:07.475]  So the first deaths we're going to see statistically will be Hispanics or Mexicans.
[02:40:07.475 --> 02:40:08.975]  Uh, where do you see this going?
[02:40:08.975 --> 02:40:18.637]  Where do you see the martial law implications with all these states of emergencies and the UN saying we're about to go to level five, then we can order quarantining and forced inoculation.
[02:40:18.637 --> 02:40:20.658]  What do you see that will be in that vaccine?
[02:40:22.500 --> 02:40:24.261]  Well, there's a lot of questions there.
[02:40:24.261 --> 02:40:30.386]  You know, I think that it's not a particularly gruesome virus.
[02:40:30.386 --> 02:40:37.532]  I don't see that the major death rates, it's certainly nowhere like 90% kill like in some populations with Ebola.
[02:40:37.532 --> 02:40:41.435]  You know, I think the most chilling evidence though against Dr. Robertson
[02:40:42.055 --> 02:41:06.568]  And his economic union research team, besides being the gatekeeper and the chief promoter of these multi-billion dollar vaccine deals, is his warning that he actually, it wasn't a warning, here's a quote, from April 27, 2006, it was a scientific discussion that was behind closed doors with a World Health Organization working group, wherein he recommended
[02:41:07.208 --> 02:41:18.558]  That quote, they would use primary, I'm sorry, they would prime the population in advance of pandemics reaching either the UK or other nations.
[02:41:18.558 --> 02:41:20.399]  Now what does that mean, priming?
[02:41:20.399 --> 02:41:22.281]  That's what I think this is.
[02:41:22.281 --> 02:41:24.983]  I think that they have already started to prime.
[02:41:24.983 --> 02:41:31.969]  And I think that you have, because they've started to release or loose these things that they call biosimilars,
[02:41:32.689 --> 02:41:34.771]  Uh, and or mock-up files.
[02:41:34.771 --> 02:41:36.213]  They call them different names now.
[02:41:36.213 --> 02:41:40.857]  They don't want you to, they don't want to say virus, you know, in their behind-closed-door meetings.
[02:41:40.857 --> 02:41:44.360]  Yeah, they're breeding, they're breeding real, they're breeding real super-viruses.
[02:41:44.360 --> 02:41:46.983]  This is what other medical doctors and virologists we've had on.
[02:41:46.983 --> 02:41:52.508]  Are you saying this is a beta test to scare everybody, to test their police state grid, and to script it?
[02:41:52.888 --> 02:42:15.985]  And cast it that the government's the savior, and then they're going to fix this problem, but then also this virus, from what other scientists are saying, is this is a carrier virus, because it has all these different DNA systems, the RNA systems, so that it can jump through animals, you name it, and spread, and that it's meant to mutate or be combined with something else that is the big mega-death driver.
[02:42:18.134 --> 02:42:19.914]  You know, all of the above.
[02:42:19.914 --> 02:42:20.695]  You think about it.
[02:42:20.695 --> 02:42:24.556]  There's a lot of money being made in biopreparedness.
[02:42:24.556 --> 02:42:25.836]  Look at all of this.
[02:42:25.836 --> 02:42:29.797]  You know, look at the media alone is making so much money from the hype.
[02:42:29.797 --> 02:42:39.740]  So when you consider what is at stake here besides the population reduction agenda, which is foremost, but they've got to do it in the most profitable way.
[02:42:39.740 --> 02:42:41.920]  That's what their game plan has always been.
[02:42:41.920 --> 02:42:47.222]  So they've got, they're making money hand over fist every which way possible with this thing.
[02:42:47.742 --> 02:42:48.743]  So killings their business.
[02:42:48.743 --> 02:42:49.703]  Business is good.
[02:42:49.703 --> 02:42:54.205]  They always make money off their phony drug wars, their wars, their police state.
[02:42:54.205 --> 02:42:56.306]  They're making money off of this.
[02:42:56.306 --> 02:42:57.807]  I mean, because think about it.
[02:42:57.807 --> 02:42:59.387]  Tens of thousands die every year in the U.S.
[02:42:59.387 --> 02:43:00.988]  of flu in Mexico.
[02:43:00.988 --> 02:43:02.108]  And this is only a few hundred.
[02:43:02.108 --> 02:43:04.109]  They're acting like it's the end of the world.
[02:43:04.109 --> 02:43:04.970]  Right.
[02:43:04.970 --> 02:43:09.152]  So you're saying this is a primer or a beta test?
[02:43:09.152 --> 02:43:10.412]  I don't think it's the real thing.
[02:43:10.412 --> 02:43:11.533]  I think it's created.
[02:43:11.533 --> 02:43:13.834]  And if it is, you know, kind of like
[02:43:14.807 --> 02:43:31.876]  Part of my prayer, you know, if I were to pray for the best outcome of what this virus really is, that it would be a legitimate escape from, you know, it's hard to even believe that though because the reality is that it's Mexico.
[02:43:31.876 --> 02:43:33.357]  It's not Atlanta.
[02:43:33.357 --> 02:43:35.778]  It's not Bethesda, Maryland where they got their labs.
[02:43:36.118 --> 02:43:37.880]  So it's just like the anthrax.
[02:43:37.880 --> 02:43:42.626]  What the hell did it end up doing down there in Boca Raton, Florida?
[02:43:42.626 --> 02:43:50.514]  Mailed specifically to these guys who were engaged, as they were, as inside dealers.
[02:43:50.514 --> 02:43:56.842]  And I'm sure you probably know the connections with 9-11 and the Boca Raton organization, American Media.
[02:43:57.282 --> 02:44:00.647]  So there were specific agendas being served.
[02:44:00.647 --> 02:44:07.597]  They were served when the anthrax was mailed to the legislators.
[02:44:07.597 --> 02:44:12.484]  There were specific agendas being served when they were mailed to Brokaw.
[02:44:12.924 --> 02:44:15.886]  So it's kind of like, what is the agenda here?
[02:44:15.886 --> 02:44:16.666]  These are all messages.
[02:44:16.666 --> 02:44:19.527]  I want to ask you a separate question.
[02:44:19.527 --> 02:44:24.050]  Why would Air Force One fly between the buildings with F-16s terrorizing people?
[02:44:24.050 --> 02:44:29.072]  We said that we knew that it would terrorize, that they knew that it would.
[02:44:29.072 --> 02:44:29.872]  And now they admit it.
[02:44:29.872 --> 02:44:31.553]  Yes, we knew it would terrorize you.
[02:44:31.553 --> 02:44:36.556]  We ordered the police and FBI not to warn people and not to tell them what it was and to let them do it.
[02:44:36.556 --> 02:44:39.397]  So they're now admitting they're running PSYOPs.
[02:44:39.397 --> 02:44:40.658]  Why did they do that PSYOP?
[02:44:42.278 --> 02:44:46.821]  Well, again, terrorists is part of this whole manipulation of the population.
[02:44:46.821 --> 02:44:50.424]  You know, you're either in fear or you're in love.
[02:44:50.424 --> 02:44:57.869]  You're at peace and joy and love, or you're in your egoic, manipulated, mind-controlled, mass-mediated, hyped brain.
[02:44:57.869 --> 02:45:00.070]  So they did it as a way to remind everybody of 9-11.
[02:45:01.766 --> 02:45:04.708]  Well, I think it's a generic neurotic.
[02:45:04.708 --> 02:45:06.990]  I mean, this is my area of expertise.
[02:45:06.990 --> 02:45:09.992]  And this is how I saw the PSYOPs being run.
[02:45:09.992 --> 02:45:12.014]  That's why I went to the FBI.
[02:45:12.014 --> 02:45:15.076]  I saw this whole thing unfolding in the media.
[02:45:15.076 --> 02:45:16.558]  And this is what they're doing now.
[02:45:16.558 --> 02:45:27.106]  If you look at the whole population reduction agenda, read the book, folks listening, Death in the Air, Globalism, Terrorism and Toxic Warfare.
[02:45:27.446 --> 02:45:31.210]  You'll get the complete understanding of what is happening.
[02:45:31.210 --> 02:45:48.688]  It is simply the revolution in military affairs, whereby they're using biological cocktails, which has a combination of things that you can't trace, and to do it, they've got to run these extreme, extensive PSYOPs.
[02:45:49.048 --> 02:45:49.509]  We're good to go.
[02:46:08.690 --> 02:46:11.993]  So it's silent weapons for quiet wars.
[02:46:11.993 --> 02:46:13.034]  I agree with you.
[02:46:13.034 --> 02:46:16.596]  And it's not just they're trying to create a neuroses of fear in us.
[02:46:16.596 --> 02:46:26.704]  They are neurotic like regular garden variety psychopaths are where they have to flaunt their power over their victims like psychos mailing letters to the police taunting them.
[02:46:26.704 --> 02:46:27.285]  Is that what you're saying?
[02:46:28.633 --> 02:46:29.473]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:46:29.473 --> 02:46:31.014]  I mean, there's a lot of trauma.
[02:46:31.014 --> 02:46:37.116]  When you talk about neuroticism, you're looking at trauma, you look at the way medicine operates.
[02:46:37.116 --> 02:46:47.860]  And in fact, you know, I have a hard time judging this fellow, James Robertson, as somebody probably should.
[02:46:47.860 --> 02:46:50.381]  A good court of law definitely needs to get these people
[02:46:50.401 --> 02:46:50.761]  I don't know.
[02:47:06.926 --> 02:47:09.408]  Completely Rockefeller controlled.
[02:47:09.408 --> 02:47:16.772]  You only get grants to do research when they tell you a grant application is requested or open.
[02:47:16.772 --> 02:47:20.795]  They track you and look at the way doctors are trained.
[02:47:20.795 --> 02:47:22.716]  It's trauma-based learning.
[02:47:22.716 --> 02:47:25.138]  It's no different from any cult.
[02:47:25.138 --> 02:47:31.182]  It is a cult manipulation indoctrination method that uses trauma, fear,
[02:47:31.582 --> 02:47:35.844]  You know, you're in competition, you don't go, you don't sleep.
[02:47:35.844 --> 02:47:39.706]  You know, they've got you in the residency programs, you don't sleep for 48 hours.
[02:47:39.706 --> 02:47:49.671]  It's definitely deprivation and traumatization, whereby then you become a virtual Manchurian candidate who thinks they're doing good.
[02:47:49.671 --> 02:47:52.252]  And that's what Bob and his boys are doing.
[02:47:52.532 --> 02:48:09.976]  It's like Marine Corps training, but for the mind, with no sleep, competition, being washed out, and by the time they're out, the doctors literally are like automaton zombies who don't question, they do what the AMA tells them, and then meanwhile they're all compartmentalized, and you see doctors and dentists have the highest rates of heart attacks and suicides.
[02:48:11.476 --> 02:48:16.178]  You know, and that's why I think that there's only a few at the very top.
[02:48:16.178 --> 02:48:27.903]  You know, the people that I really distrust are Harold Jaffe, who's in charge of the America's Infectious Disease Agency, you know, National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases.
[02:48:28.803 --> 02:48:31.366]  This guy knows what's going on.
[02:48:31.366 --> 02:48:41.598]  This guy knows that AIDS was created and injected by Merck Pharmaceutical Hepatitis B vaccines into gay men in New York and blacks in Central Africa between 1972 and 1974.
[02:48:43.840 --> 02:48:45.441]  All of this is definitive.
[02:48:45.441 --> 02:48:53.486]  It's science, it's rock science, and that's why I've published not just the book Emerging Viruses, but also in the scientific literature, peer-reviewed science.
[02:48:53.486 --> 02:48:56.048]  But yet, look at what is the media doing.
[02:48:56.048 --> 02:48:58.129]  Neglecting genocide.
[02:48:58.129 --> 02:49:06.955]  Neglecting the fact that our children, and our children's children, are being decimated genetically, and through the chemical... That's right, the mercury is altering the DNA.
[02:49:07.555 --> 02:49:07.936]  Yeah.
[02:49:22.572 --> 02:49:22.852]  I think?
[02:49:46.833 --> 02:49:47.654]  Because you're right!
[02:49:47.654 --> 02:49:55.678]  They are doing the preparatory phase, and I've seen months and months and months of preparatory phase for bird flu, for swine flu.
[02:49:55.678 --> 02:50:01.882]  That's why a month ago I said on air, I think the next card they're going to play is going to be some super flu, and look what's happening!
[02:50:01.882 --> 02:50:03.863]  So you can see it, I can see it.
[02:50:03.863 --> 02:50:05.604]  How do we get the public where they can see it?
[02:50:05.604 --> 02:50:08.025]  And that comes up with the 100th monkey.
[02:50:08.025 --> 02:50:09.086]  Start talking about that.
[02:50:09.086 --> 02:50:16.510]  I mean, these studies where you've got an island with monkeys, and as soon as you can train the monkeys on one island, five miles away, suddenly these monkeys know
[02:50:16.932 --> 02:50:19.644]  As if there's some almost radio wave connection.
[02:50:21.616 --> 02:50:24.897]  Well, you know, the number one thing is you've got to get people out of fear.
[02:50:24.897 --> 02:50:28.478]  So to get them out of fear, you've got to have a holistic approach.
[02:50:28.478 --> 02:50:37.681]  You know, everything from oxysilver, which is a protective, I don't worry about this thing, and you want to look at suppression, look at what silver hydrosols have undergone.
[02:50:37.681 --> 02:50:43.382]  The fact is that the government and the pharmaceutical industry has been suppressing the silver hydrosols.
[02:50:43.382 --> 02:50:45.603]  Again, oxysilver is my favorite.
[02:50:45.603 --> 02:50:47.044]  But, you know, you don't... Give the website.
[02:50:47.044 --> 02:50:47.504]  Give the website.
[02:50:47.504 --> 02:50:47.984]  We've got to break.
[02:50:48.644 --> 02:50:50.684]  Yeah, oxysilver.com.
[02:50:50.684 --> 02:50:52.505]  O-X-Y-S-I-L-V-E-R dot com.
[02:50:52.505 --> 02:50:55.825]  All right, we've got a break.
[02:50:55.825 --> 02:50:56.785]  Oxysilver.com.
[02:50:56.785 --> 02:50:59.206]  We'll be right back with Dr. Len Horowitz and a few of your phone calls.
[02:50:59.206 --> 02:50:59.746]  Stay with us.
[02:50:59.746 --> 02:51:01.626]  Hardcore info.
[02:51:01.626 --> 02:51:05.067]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[02:51:05.067 --> 02:51:09.308]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[02:51:09.308 --> 02:51:17.289]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water
[02:51:17.569 --> 02:51:17.989]  We're good to go!
[02:51:47.386 --> 02:51:51.349]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:51:51.349 --> 02:51:56.713]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[02:52:15.347 --> 02:52:21.934]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:52:21.934 --> 02:52:23.916]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:52:23.916 --> 02:52:26.419]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:52:26.419 --> 02:52:37.391]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:52:37.984 --> 02:52:39.644]  It's not about left or right.
[02:52:39.644 --> 02:52:41.505]  It's about a one world government.
[02:52:41.505 --> 02:52:48.407]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:52:48.407 --> 02:52:56.669]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:52:56.669 --> 02:52:58.250]  The Obama Deception.
[02:52:58.250 --> 02:52:59.450]  The people strike back.
[02:53:02.034 --> 02:53:07.538]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[02:53:07.538 --> 02:53:08.319]  and the world.
[02:53:08.319 --> 02:53:12.201]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[02:53:12.201 --> 02:53:18.686]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[02:53:18.686 --> 02:53:20.727]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[02:53:20.727 --> 02:53:25.811]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish.
[02:53:25.851 --> 02:53:26.151]  I think so.
[02:53:44.215 --> 02:53:45.316]  Free of charge.

[02:54:13.021 --> 02:54:16.885]  Alright, we got loaded phones, obviously, for Dr. Horowitz.
[02:54:16.885 --> 02:54:20.428]  We posted this interview up at InfoWars.com after the live radio show today.
[02:54:20.428 --> 02:54:24.992]  And the video of this at PrisonPlanet.tv that we're streaming live at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[02:54:24.992 --> 02:54:29.536]  Coming up in about 10 minutes, Steve Quayle joins us.
[02:54:29.536 --> 02:54:35.001]  Before we go back to Dr. Lynn Horowitz, tell you about a few of the sponsors that make this syndicated transmission possible.
[02:54:36.696 --> 02:54:38.379]  eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:54:38.379 --> 02:54:43.710]  eFoodsDirect.com is the longest continually operating, highest quality, storable foods company out there.
[02:54:43.710 --> 02:54:47.858]  It's where I've chosen to get my storable, non-GMO, non-hybrid.
[02:54:49.019 --> 02:54:52.741]  A good organic food from eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:54:52.741 --> 02:54:55.022]  The best prices because they are the biggest.
[02:54:55.022 --> 02:54:56.683]  And so they pass on that discount to you.
[02:54:56.683 --> 02:55:01.186]  It's good in these crazy times to have water filters, to have medicines, to have food.
[02:55:01.186 --> 02:55:02.247]  And I've got it.
[02:55:02.247 --> 02:55:03.147]  You need it too.
[02:55:03.147 --> 02:55:03.827]  Very affordable.
[02:55:03.827 --> 02:55:05.589]  eFoodsDirect.com, eFoodsDirect.com or 1-800-409-5633.
[02:55:05.589 --> 02:55:05.649]  1-800-409-5633.
[02:55:11.852 --> 02:55:19.294]  Also another fine sponsor is a Cola Blue, the atmospheric water generator that grabs the water right out of the air that we breathe.
[02:55:19.294 --> 02:55:23.176]  And it doesn't go through the sewer system or toilet to tap or the fluoride added.
[02:55:23.176 --> 02:55:24.316]  No, it's right out of the air.
[02:55:24.316 --> 02:55:26.897]  Then it goes through seven filters including reverse osmosis.
[02:55:27.577 --> 02:55:31.420]  They got a bunch of units, but their regular smaller unit produces seven and a half gallons a day.
[02:55:31.420 --> 02:55:37.664]  I have one at home and one here right here in the office.
[02:55:37.664 --> 02:55:38.465]  We love it.
[02:55:38.465 --> 02:55:38.705]  800-691-6043.
[02:55:38.705 --> 02:55:40.667]  800-691-6043. acolablue.com.
[02:55:40.667 --> 02:55:43.269]  E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.com.
[02:55:43.269 --> 02:55:44.810]  Need to start getting off the grid.
[02:55:44.810 --> 02:55:49.533]  They also have a little solar panel you can plug into it and run it off of that as well for out in the boonies or whatever.
[02:55:49.533 --> 02:55:50.354]  acolablue.com.
[02:55:51.437 --> 02:55:55.518]  Okay, I want to go to a few final calls, and Dr. Horowitz has agreed to come on Friday or Monday.
[02:55:55.518 --> 02:56:00.380]  You're going to be hearing him back here on the show for another hour interview to mainly take your calls.
[02:56:00.380 --> 02:56:12.004]  But it really shakes me up to hear him saying all this, because I know he backs it up, and he's just been able to... I mean, he predicted before the anthrax attack it was going to happen, and then the day after it came out, you know, to more detail.
[02:56:12.004 --> 02:56:13.404]  Just amazing.
[02:56:13.404 --> 02:56:18.546]  So we want to commend him for his foresight and understanding of this and his great knowledge.
[02:56:20.253 --> 02:56:22.174]  Let's talk to Don in Texas.
[02:56:22.174 --> 02:56:23.555]  Don, you're on the air with Dr. Len Horowitz.
[02:56:23.555 --> 02:56:24.655]  Go ahead.
[02:56:24.655 --> 02:56:26.496]  Hello, Dr. Horowitz and Alex.
[02:56:26.496 --> 02:56:28.357]  God bless and keep you for what you're doing.
[02:56:28.357 --> 02:56:40.063]  I want to thank, first of all, thank Dr. Horowitz for literally saving my life through the publication of this book, AIDS and Ebola, Accident or Intentional, back in 1994.
[02:56:40.063 --> 02:56:45.966]  I used that information there to survive hepatitis C, and I'm just so grateful for him for providing it.
[02:56:45.966 --> 02:56:47.727]  My question for you both is there
[02:56:48.545 --> 02:57:00.698]  A possibility that you and tetrahedron.org get together and draw up a list of indictable offenses that we could put in front of our grand juries at a county level throughout the United States.
[02:57:02.312 --> 02:57:04.034]  Well, that's a great question, brother.
[02:57:04.034 --> 02:57:05.114]  Thank you so much.
[02:57:05.114 --> 02:57:19.247]  You know, my area of expertise is not law, and if you can put together a group of volunteer attorneys who might be able to advance that, and maybe with the sovereignty movement, we don't even need to go that route.
[02:57:19.247 --> 02:57:27.234]  Maybe what we could do is some other mechanism by which these people can be brought to justice and be accountable for what they're doing.
[02:57:27.714 --> 02:57:28.314]  I have an idea.
[02:57:28.314 --> 02:57:31.135]  You know, you can't get them at first for the big thing.
[02:57:31.135 --> 02:57:37.856]  You start it with the fact that they are mixing weaponized level viruses together and then mailing them around.
[02:57:37.856 --> 02:57:41.717]  So you go after them for endangering the public, for gross neglect.
[02:57:41.717 --> 02:57:42.777]  There's a lot of charges.
[02:57:42.777 --> 02:57:44.318]  You can prove they've done that.
[02:57:44.318 --> 02:57:51.800]  Then once you've gotten them in an investigation with a grand jury and you go after a bunch of these companies, they'll start spilling their guts.
[02:57:51.800 --> 02:57:53.200]  Would you agree with that idea, Dr. Horowitz?
[02:57:53.940 --> 02:57:54.881]  That sounds great.
[02:57:54.881 --> 02:57:58.603]  You know, at this point, Gee Whiz, you know, I've got a plan, too.
[02:57:58.603 --> 02:58:04.888]  We'll have to do a show on Live H2O again this coming summer solstice, June 19th to the 21st.
[02:58:04.888 --> 02:58:07.590]  I'd love to talk about the plan that I've got.
[02:58:07.590 --> 02:58:11.112]  I believe that the Creator has for us getting out of this mess.
[02:58:11.112 --> 02:58:20.759]  But anything that people can do, you know, that is going to help to save lives and to wake people up is going to be a blessing.
[02:58:20.759 --> 02:58:22.260]  So I totally encourage
[02:58:23.121 --> 02:58:25.142]  Everything that we can possibly do.
[02:58:25.142 --> 02:58:26.802]  Well, I agree with you.
[02:58:26.802 --> 02:58:29.323]  At the core, it's about the spirit, the soul, the mind.
[02:58:29.323 --> 02:58:33.904]  If we break through mentally and stop being afraid, then we can beat these people.
[02:58:33.904 --> 02:58:35.744]  We have to believe in ourselves first, though.
[02:58:35.744 --> 02:58:38.945]  Back in 70 seconds with more calls for Dr. Len Horowitz.
[02:58:38.945 --> 02:58:43.006]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[02:58:43.006 --> 02:58:46.407]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.407 --> 02:58:48.448]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.650 --> 02:58:53.332]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:58:53.332 --> 02:58:58.098]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:58:58.098 --> 02:59:01.062]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:59:01.062 --> 02:59:04.106]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:59:04.106 --> 02:59:09.954]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[02:59:10.174 --> 02:59:13.397]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:59:13.397 --> 02:59:20.382]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[02:59:20.382 --> 02:59:23.685]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[02:59:23.685 --> 02:59:23.925]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:23.925 --> 02:59:25.226]  Or on the web, go to efoodsdirect.com.
[02:59:28.809 --> 02:59:35.073]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-stride, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[02:59:35.073 --> 02:59:38.675]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:38.675 --> 02:59:40.216]  Again, 800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:59:40.216 --> 02:59:40.836]  Take action today.
[02:59:40.836 --> 02:59:42.817]  The first step is getting storable food.
[02:59:54.218 --> 02:59:56.599]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.599 --> 03:00:11.848]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:11.848 --> 03:00:21.054]  Continual coverage of Miss Mutagen's designer virus blurring.
[03:00:22.486 --> 03:00:23.367]  Hey, how's it going guys?
[03:00:52.978 --> 03:00:54.458]  Good.
[03:00:54.458 --> 03:00:54.898]  Good?
[03:00:54.898 --> 03:00:55.819]  All right.
[03:00:55.819 --> 03:01:03.901]  Um, just want to say that, uh, I'm one of those hemophiliacs that, uh, kind of survived the whole, uh, age thing when they put it in the factor.
[03:01:03.901 --> 03:01:15.023]  I had, uh, three bad batches of the factor A. And telling you this is how the game really works is, and like your guest says, this is the trigger mechanism.
[03:01:15.023 --> 03:01:17.124]  They're going to drop the hammer afterwards.
[03:01:17.124 --> 03:01:18.084]  They did the same thing
[03:01:18.824 --> 03:01:20.346]  Uh, with the whole AIDS thing.
[03:01:20.346 --> 03:01:27.693]  You get everybody with hepatitis, lower their immune system, then you drop the AIDS bomb on them.
[03:01:27.693 --> 03:01:35.141]  Yeah, the globalists like to mix a lot of these binary weapons, different systems together, so they're protected.
[03:01:35.141 --> 03:01:40.105]  They want it weak, where they can just toy with people so it won't blow back on them.
[03:01:40.105 --> 03:01:42.087]  How important is that, Dr. Horowitz?
[03:01:43.001 --> 03:01:43.901]  That's exactly right.
[03:01:43.901 --> 03:01:45.002]  Vitally important.
[03:01:45.002 --> 03:01:53.646]  Subject of how to take your body from being susceptible to these infectious diseases to make it impregnable against these diseases.
[03:01:53.646 --> 03:01:56.487]  This is what the wonderful work that I've been involved in.
[03:01:56.487 --> 03:01:58.408]  So I'll tell you something Alex.
[03:01:59.048 --> 03:02:02.009]  You know, I am not into this fear business.
[03:02:02.009 --> 03:02:06.110]  You know, people used to hound me all the time saying, Oh, Horowitz is about gloom and doom.
[03:02:06.110 --> 03:02:14.453]  You know, the reality is I'm totally into the solutions and we're, you know, blessed, totally blessed to have all the solutions that we need.
[03:02:14.453 --> 03:02:15.613]  We're not in fear.
[03:02:15.613 --> 03:02:18.174]  We're moving ahead forcefully with the solutions.
[03:02:18.994 --> 03:02:29.097]  The insanity, the hypocrisy, the lunacy, all of this has got to stop and we've got all of the things that are available to us.
[03:02:29.097 --> 03:02:31.837]  The real solution, Alex, here it is.
[03:02:31.837 --> 03:02:33.078]  It's in water.
[03:02:33.078 --> 03:02:36.839]  You had a commercial on a couple minutes ago about a water machine from air.
[03:02:37.699 --> 03:02:42.621]  There is every problem in the world can be solved with water.
[03:02:42.621 --> 03:02:43.982]  Hydrogen, oxygen.
[03:02:43.982 --> 03:02:56.907]  If you just know what the power of hydrogen is with the electron donation and understanding the entire universe, all spirituality and energy comes from electron transports, piezoelectricity.
[03:02:56.907 --> 03:03:00.869]  That's what makes this whole oxidative reduction reactions in your body.
[03:03:02.931 --> 03:03:07.775]  If you simply know water and you breathe a lot, you get oxygen in your body.
[03:03:07.775 --> 03:03:10.477]  These germs have no place.
[03:03:10.477 --> 03:03:20.946]  And so, you know, it's like if you want to be in fear, which causes stress, which causes body acidification, then you go right ahead, but it's not going to be healthier for you.
[03:03:20.946 --> 03:03:26.711]  So it's really about boosting immunity holistically and Premier is water.
[03:03:27.432 --> 03:03:31.914]  Well, I don't want to have you back on about that and the latest developments with this in the next few days, but I agree with you.
[03:03:31.914 --> 03:03:32.714]  That's what we're doing here.
[03:03:32.714 --> 03:03:35.315]  We're exposing the evil and then giving the alternative.
[03:03:35.315 --> 03:03:37.295]  We're showing don't take the shots.
[03:03:37.295 --> 03:03:38.436]  That's not negative.
[03:03:38.436 --> 03:03:39.236]  That's positive.
[03:03:39.236 --> 03:03:42.277]  We're here saying this flu is probably overblown.
[03:03:42.277 --> 03:03:47.719]  Meanwhile, the media is saying it's the end of the world and we're here exposing that it's
[03:03:48.439 --> 03:03:51.580]  The action is in the reaction if we give in to fear.
[03:03:51.580 --> 03:03:55.001]  I mean, people say, Alex, you're paranoid, you're fearful of the government.
[03:03:55.001 --> 03:03:57.341]  No, I'm standing up and fighting them.
[03:03:57.341 --> 03:04:01.162]  If I was fearful, I would be cowering and not going up against them.
[03:04:01.162 --> 03:04:02.983]  But, you know, you have to tell folks, too, the carnage.
[03:04:02.983 --> 03:04:06.303]  You know, your mother, as you've said, died from a vaccine, correct?
[03:04:06.303 --> 03:04:09.704]  This guy almost got killed by the Factor VIII.
[03:04:09.704 --> 03:04:12.805]  I mean, the level of carnage is going on out there.
[03:04:12.805 --> 03:04:16.806]  We do need to tell people, though, what's going to happen to them if they keep going down this path.
[03:04:17.626 --> 03:04:19.848]  It's a godly service.
[03:04:19.848 --> 03:04:21.049]  It's a public service.
[03:04:21.049 --> 03:04:22.089]  It's a great blessing.
[03:04:22.089 --> 03:04:31.577]  And the wonderful thing is that you, like I, receive all this wonderful mail from people whose lives were changed and children were saved by what we're doing.
[03:04:31.577 --> 03:04:32.037]  Absolutely.
[03:04:32.037 --> 03:04:33.998]  You know, there's so many websites you've got.
[03:04:33.998 --> 03:04:35.499]  Fire out a couple of them, Dr. Horowitz.
[03:04:36.468 --> 03:04:46.976]  Well, again, the most important would be oxysilver.com, because essentially, it's silver as a superconductor, and water is a liquid crystal superconductor.
[03:04:46.976 --> 03:04:52.920]  And if you understand anything about love and energy, you understand about 528 frequency.
[03:04:52.920 --> 03:04:57.684]  For those people who want to really get a full blessing, go to love528.com.
[03:04:57.684 --> 03:05:00.786]  Alright, we're out of time, Dr. Horowitz.
[03:05:00.786 --> 03:05:01.987]  Let me talk to you here in the break.
[03:05:04.016 --> 03:05:08.538]  If you owe the IRS, you can't make the problem go away without professional help.
[03:05:08.538 --> 03:05:11.899]  But with the help of Dan Pilla, you can get your problem solved.
[03:05:11.899 --> 03:05:16.760]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla, and I've been solving tax debt problems for 30 years, and I can help you too.
[03:05:16.760 --> 03:05:21.382]  We can stabilize IRS collection action and get your tax debt reduced, sometimes completely eliminated.
[03:05:21.934 --> 03:05:33.770]  And if you received a 1099 from a bank because of mortgage or other debt forgiveness, the vast majority of the time, I can show you how to completely erase it so you pay no taxes on what the IRS will consider to be taxable income.
[03:05:33.770 --> 03:05:36.594]  Call us for a free consultation to discuss the many possibilities.
[03:05:37.074 --> 03:05:40.315]  Call 1-800-34-NO-TAX.
[03:05:40.315 --> 03:05:43.636]  That's 800-34-N-O-T-A-X.
[03:05:43.636 --> 03:05:46.738]  Or go to my website at TaxHelpOnline.com.
[03:05:46.738 --> 03:05:52.039]  Dan Pilla has been protecting taxpayers from the IRS for three decades, and he can help you.
[03:05:52.039 --> 03:05:53.020]  Call us today, 800-346-6829.
[03:05:53.020 --> 03:05:53.480]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX.
[03:05:53.480 --> 03:05:55.861]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[03:06:05.140 --> 03:06:07.764]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:06:07.764 --> 03:06:14.754]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:06:15.347 --> 03:06:21.874]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:06:21.874 --> 03:06:23.916]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:06:23.916 --> 03:06:26.419]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:06:26.419 --> 03:06:37.311]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[03:06:37.981 --> 03:06:39.643]  It's not about left or right.
[03:06:39.643 --> 03:06:41.504]  It's about a one world government.
[03:06:41.504 --> 03:06:48.431]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:06:48.431 --> 03:06:56.678]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at Infowars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:06:56.678 --> 03:06:58.260]  The Obama Deception.
[03:06:58.260 --> 03:06:59.461]  The people strike back.
[03:07:01.368 --> 03:07:08.592]  You already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[03:07:08.592 --> 03:07:13.134]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[03:07:13.134 --> 03:07:18.757]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.
[03:07:18.757 --> 03:07:25.821]  Using Plasma pH Drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline, to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[03:07:26.281 --> 03:07:31.665]  Simply put, 10 drops per liter of water you drink to raise the pH to the ultimate level.
[03:07:31.665 --> 03:07:37.510]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[03:07:37.510 --> 03:07:42.974]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline, high pH environment.

[03:07:49.257 --> 03:07:52.018]  That's A-L-K-A Vision dot com.

[03:07:53.599 --> 03:08:03.224]  269-216-9767 today!
[03:08:03.224 --> 03:08:09.867]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:09.867 --> 03:08:12.829]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:33.387 --> 03:08:41.554]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, working on things there behind the scenes during the break, and we do have Steve Quayle on the line with us, joining us.
[03:08:41.554 --> 03:08:46.058]  Steve Quayle, author of a book, going back over ten years ago, on trans
[03:08:47.685 --> 03:08:55.892]  Genic bioweapons and I saw an article out of the Associated Press last night and several others.
[03:08:55.892 --> 03:08:57.553]  In fact, guys, Google this and hit news.
[03:08:57.553 --> 03:09:00.696]  I want to show it to viewers out there watching who don't believe it.
[03:09:00.696 --> 03:09:03.178]  Glow-in-the-dark dogs.
[03:09:03.178 --> 03:09:06.221]  And they now have dogs that give birth to glow-in-the-dark dogs.
[03:09:06.221 --> 03:09:09.424]  They have glow-in-the-dark monkeys you can buy for at least 12 years I've known of.
[03:09:09.424 --> 03:09:12.786]  They have human genes mixed with insects, with monkeys, with apes.
[03:09:13.607 --> 03:09:32.147]  uh... with cows they have these uh... humanoid apart cow creatures are already growing in utero and cow uteruses that i saw in nineteen ninety eight the bbc and you tell the public this and they laugh at you because uh... i guess they don't read the news south korean expert claims to have cloned glowing dogs
[03:09:32.808 --> 03:09:36.772]  And then that's AP, and then it actually shows video of them.
[03:09:36.772 --> 03:09:38.074]  They didn't claim anything.
[03:09:38.074 --> 03:09:46.843]  This has been out for over a decade with glowing dogs, glowing jellyfish, monkeys that glow with jellyfish genetics, to be technical.
[03:09:46.843 --> 03:09:52.990]  And so I wanted to bring Steve Quayle up and get the latest information on this.
[03:09:53.970 --> 03:10:22.506]  uh... whole subject of the flu a few days has passed since i had steve on monday we uh... we're both guest together for two hours on coast-to-coast am for extremely powerful uh... transmission there's now been a death uh... in texas but it was a mexican national twenty three-month-old boy who came in in uh... mid uh... april about fifteen days ago in the brownsville was transferred on the last week to uh... houston where he died of this flu
[03:10:23.466 --> 03:10:29.191]  And if it only continues to kill Mexicans, is it race-specific?
[03:10:29.191 --> 03:10:35.717]  Because that is, it'll make other varieties of Homo sapiens sapiens sick, but won't kill them.
[03:10:35.717 --> 03:10:40.441]  Or is this because they're chemically debilitated in Mexico City, where he came from?
[03:10:40.441 --> 03:10:43.825]  All of this and more with Steve Quayle in the next 50 minutes.
[03:10:43.825 --> 03:10:45.126]  Steve Quayle, thanks for coming on with us.
[03:10:45.606 --> 03:10:46.307]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:10:46.307 --> 03:10:55.937]  Boy, this is like, all of these events are amping up in total, I would say, total New World Order scripted delight.
[03:10:55.937 --> 03:11:01.243]  Even as we're talking about this, I think in Fort Myers, Florida, the joint NATO-U.S.
[03:11:01.243 --> 03:11:03.766]  military is having landing exercises.
[03:11:03.766 --> 03:11:05.328]  You've probably seen the video, have you not?
[03:11:05.814 --> 03:11:06.954]  Yeah, I forgot that.
[03:11:06.954 --> 03:11:08.815]  Burmese played it last night, because I sent it to you.
[03:11:08.815 --> 03:11:09.476]  He played it right.
[03:11:09.476 --> 03:11:12.337]  Yeah, but it's really important for people to understand this.
[03:11:12.337 --> 03:11:19.840]  Secretary of Defense Gates made the statement, and ladies and gentlemen, you need to listen to what Alex and what I are saying and giving you the heads up.
[03:11:19.840 --> 03:11:27.263]  Secretary of Defense Gates made a statement so astonishing, yet it was totally glossed over by the mainstream media, and simply this.
[03:11:27.643 --> 03:11:38.072]  That due to the financial collapse and the calamities that are going to be coming on the United States during the summer, he made an appeal to NATO to send their troops.
[03:11:38.072 --> 03:11:39.413]  Did you see that?
[03:11:39.413 --> 03:11:40.554]  Yes.
[03:11:40.554 --> 03:11:51.423]  And in the fact, Alex, that now we have a scripted and an orchestrated boogeyman on a worldwide scale, i.e., and it should not be called a swine flu, okay?
[03:11:51.423 --> 03:11:55.166]  Let's call it what it is, a New World Order cocktail of death, okay?
[03:11:55.726 --> 03:12:01.150]  Because this thing is no more swine flu than bird flu is strictly bird flu.
[03:12:01.150 --> 03:12:05.113]  We've talked about the genetic alteration of genomes and what that would mean.
[03:12:05.113 --> 03:12:16.020]  Now, I put up on my website the most critical story before people go poo-pooing you and I about, is this a bio or an ethnically directed weapon?
[03:12:16.020 --> 03:12:20.103]  They need to go and read the history of who already possesses such weapons.
[03:12:20.103 --> 03:12:22.525]  It's not a question of can they develop them, they're already developed.
[03:12:22.965 --> 03:12:28.287]  You quoted with George Noy the other night, remember, the former Vice President's statement on it.
[03:12:28.287 --> 03:12:29.847]  So where are we going now?
[03:12:29.847 --> 03:12:36.530]  The exploding vials of swine flu, quote their term, New World Order, death cocktail, my term, in
[03:12:38.230 --> 03:12:42.531]  Switzerland, that actually was on the French-Swiss border in the area of Freiburg.
[03:12:42.531 --> 03:12:50.873]  The fascinating thing about this, I think that's a declaration now, that just as it's going to go down in the United States, it's going to go down in the European Union.
[03:12:50.873 --> 03:13:01.116]  We'll have our first glimpse of that as the EU, the European Union, the Eurodollar starts to go, get sold off in unison with the U.S.
[03:13:01.116 --> 03:13:01.876]  dollar.
[03:13:01.876 --> 03:13:04.797]  The thing that's important for people to understand, this is scripted.
[03:13:05.217 --> 03:13:16.950]  And Alex, as you and I have said in the past, even if this isn't the full release of the most deadly biological pathogen in the world, it is the most amazing field beta test going on, because they're tracking.
[03:13:16.950 --> 03:13:27.221]  Look, their supercomputers are already projecting the outcome, and whether the information is accurate or not, we will never be told how many people are dying, etc., until it serves their purpose.
[03:13:27.561 --> 03:13:32.586]  And the only purpose it will serve is to basically get everybody into forced, uh, mandatory vaccinations.
[03:13:32.586 --> 03:13:50.264]  It is interesting that with the lead time that magazines take to come up with their stories, Time Magazine has already got an article out, as if they were tipped off, that this will lead to forced and mandatory vaccinations, and the laws implemented for a $250,000 fine and so many years in prison are already in the books.
[03:13:50.604 --> 03:13:59.514]  And now it makes all those laughing hyenas maybe sit up and take notice that now the vehicle's in place to make everybody have to take the vaccination.
[03:13:59.514 --> 03:14:01.116]  Those who refuse go to the camps.
[03:14:01.116 --> 03:14:03.799]  It is so plain and apparent at this point.
[03:14:06.027 --> 03:14:10.668]  Now, Steve, I want to go back to what you just talked about, about NATO troops.
[03:14:10.668 --> 03:14:11.808]  Lay out the source of that.
[03:14:11.808 --> 03:14:13.429]  Let's spend some time on that.
[03:14:13.429 --> 03:14:17.529]  Perry announcing a state of emergency in Texas over one death.
[03:14:17.529 --> 03:14:19.070]  This is just amazing.
[03:14:19.070 --> 03:14:24.131]  And then we also hear about how they may need to go to Level 5.
[03:14:24.131 --> 03:14:27.551]  The head of the U.N., Secretary General Braggs that we are under U.N.
[03:14:27.551 --> 03:14:28.552]  control, that the U.S.
[03:14:28.552 --> 03:14:31.492]  and Mexico and other countries are following their orders.
[03:14:31.492 --> 03:14:34.353]  And this is a great test of the U.N.'
[03:14:34.333 --> 03:14:34.813]  's control.
[03:14:35.633 --> 03:14:36.033]  Absolutely.
[03:14:36.033 --> 03:14:43.936]  The Security Council obviously can order troops into any place that they feel is a destabilizing force to the world at large.
[03:14:43.936 --> 03:14:49.038]  Now remember, Alex, this is the most important term your listeners can get into their minds.
[03:14:49.038 --> 03:14:51.359]  It's curative process.
[03:14:51.359 --> 03:14:54.220]  It does not mean helping people by any means.
[03:14:54.840 --> 03:15:08.050]  Under the current agreements that are out there, especially in the world of medical coordination and syncopation of activities, it is the dilemma that is presented with people.
[03:15:08.050 --> 03:15:09.071]  Why are there only 450 million
[03:15:11.032 --> 03:15:12.113]  doses of vaccine.
[03:15:12.113 --> 03:15:18.436]  You and I have been heralding for a decade the new world order wants 5.5 billion people killed.
[03:15:18.436 --> 03:15:23.799]  There are 500, let's say approximately 500 million doses of effective vaccine.
[03:15:23.799 --> 03:15:37.186]  What people don't understand is there are multiple, multiple strains of this biological variant and virus that are being initiated and being put out there worldwide and that's to keep all
[03:15:37.606 --> 03:15:37.927]  I don't know.
[03:15:59.990 --> 03:16:10.416]  People at MIT, every place out there would be jealous of some of these men's pedigrees, yet systematically they have been annihilated, destroyed, assassinated, whatever you want to say.
[03:16:10.416 --> 03:16:17.500]  So now we've got multiple strains of genetically altered, the cocktail of death, going out to different points of the globe.
[03:16:17.500 --> 03:16:25.605]  And this thing in France and Switzerland is really critical, because it tells you why the NATO troops are going to be here too, is that France right now is probably the most
[03:16:26.326 --> 03:16:30.840]  The closest nation in the world to having a full-fledged revolution.
[03:16:31.503 --> 03:16:35.965]  If you introduce another variable, i.e.
[03:16:35.965 --> 03:16:41.686]  a full-blown panic with everything else that's going, that may be what's necessary to tip the scale.
[03:16:41.686 --> 03:16:53.250]  I maintain that whatever caused those vials to explode, there were not mine, was not just simply freezing or not freezing something that was compressed and expanding.
[03:16:53.250 --> 03:16:57.772]  I believe that there must have been some form of a time detonation or some form
[03:16:58.172 --> 03:16:58.633]  Thank you.
[03:17:04.699 --> 03:17:06.841]  You're going to destabilize the world.
[03:17:06.841 --> 03:17:09.703]  You're going to destabilize it in the full sense of the word.
[03:17:09.703 --> 03:17:11.144]  Order out of chaos.
[03:17:11.144 --> 03:17:12.545]  We quote it in Latin.
[03:17:12.545 --> 03:17:13.926]  Tex Mars has written about it.
[03:17:13.926 --> 03:17:16.328]  You and I quote it on all the things we talk about.
[03:17:16.328 --> 03:17:17.809]  Yet we're seeing it right now.
[03:17:17.809 --> 03:17:20.011]  The chaos isn't even here yet.
[03:17:20.011 --> 03:17:22.713]  Yet Governor Perry, as you said, just declared what?
[03:17:22.713 --> 03:17:25.255]  A national health emergency or a state health emergency?
[03:17:25.255 --> 03:17:28.037]  Governor Schwarzenegger a couple days ago in California?
[03:17:28.617 --> 03:17:42.287]  I would say this that we're going to have to first see multiple deaths in different states in the United States other than the Hispanic or Latino community to convince me that this thing is a full-scale pandemic.
[03:17:42.287 --> 03:17:49.132]  I believe this is the presentation of pandemic and that they are simply trying to use this to scare everybody.
[03:17:49.132 --> 03:17:51.733]  This is what Henry Kissinger was talking about.
[03:17:51.733 --> 03:17:52.414]  The world is
[03:17:52.794 --> 03:17:53.295]  We're good to go.
[03:18:07.631 --> 03:18:10.253]  The economy just shrunk again in the last quarter by 6.1%.
[03:18:10.253 --> 03:18:12.875]  That's total depression level.
[03:18:12.875 --> 03:18:14.356]  Massive unemployment.
[03:18:14.356 --> 03:18:17.439]  Obama's not going after Bush for the torture.
[03:18:17.439 --> 03:18:19.080]  That was coming to a head.
[03:18:19.080 --> 03:18:20.261]  None of this is being discussed.
[03:18:20.261 --> 03:18:22.463]  It's all flu, flu, flu, flu.
[03:18:22.463 --> 03:18:29.228]  And then every scientist, every virologist, every doctor I have on, and even mainstream, they admit this thing looks like it was manufactured.
[03:18:30.177 --> 03:18:33.721]  And then, if it's not killing a bunch of people, what is all the hype?
[03:18:33.721 --> 03:18:34.642]  What is all the fear?
[03:18:34.642 --> 03:18:36.684]  They're using this as a cover story.
[03:18:36.684 --> 03:18:42.971]  The question is, will it mutate into something worse, or what is going to be in these vaccines?
[03:18:42.971 --> 03:18:51.261]  And then there's the calls to Joyce Riley, and the confirmed mass graves, and the confirmed counties being called, and managers in Illinois, and
[03:18:51.781 --> 03:18:53.782]  Indiana and Texas and New York.
[03:18:53.782 --> 03:18:54.943]  Can you have mass graves?
[03:18:54.943 --> 03:18:56.083]  I've got the documents.
[03:18:56.083 --> 03:18:58.004]  Are you ready for a flu pandemic?
[03:18:58.004 --> 03:19:04.668]  They've been priming the locals that this is going to happen and having drills the last few months at never-before-seen levels.
[03:19:06.045 --> 03:19:09.668]  Right up to this point, that's why I was saying they may launch some type of flu.
[03:19:09.668 --> 03:19:17.113]  I mean, just in my gut, Steve, this is tied, I think, to the big one in some way.
[03:19:17.113 --> 03:19:22.896]  Does that mean an economic collapse, a nuke out of left field, an attack on Iran, an attack on Pakistan?
[03:19:22.896 --> 03:19:33.263]  They've got CIA, former section chiefs, head of counter-terrorism on Fox, saying Al-Qaeda has a nuke out of Pakistan and giving no evidence or no sources.
[03:19:33.263 --> 03:19:33.484]  I mean,
[03:19:34.324 --> 03:19:40.469]  I mean, just in my gut, and then intellectually, all the evidence, it's like they're moving in high gear.
[03:19:40.469 --> 03:19:43.731]  All of this acceleration of tyranny was just the preparation.
[03:19:43.731 --> 03:19:51.897]  Now everything's going from light speed, to warp speed, to warp 2, warp 3, warp 4, right up to, you know, warp 9 here.
[03:19:51.897 --> 03:19:53.338]  We'll talk to Steve Quill when we get back.
[03:19:53.338 --> 03:19:55.080]  Some of your phone calls coming up too.
[03:19:55.080 --> 03:19:59.423]  A recap of top stories as we track the designer bioweapon flu.
[03:19:59.423 --> 03:20:00.624]  How deadly is it?
[03:20:00.624 --> 03:20:01.885]  How bad will the emergency get?
[03:20:02.389 --> 03:20:05.491]  Are you tired of losing your hard-earned savings in retirement?
[03:20:05.491 --> 03:20:12.536]  Does the continued loss of purchasing power through the hidden tax of inflation brought on by trillions of dollars in government bailouts bother you?
[03:20:12.536 --> 03:20:17.340]  Then please let me, Duane Daly, with Midas Resources, help you to protect what you have left.
[03:20:17.340 --> 03:20:27.327]  Call me at 800-686-2237 extension 115 and I will explain to you how to retain your wealth and purchasing power now and in the future with gold and silver.
[03:20:27.327 --> 03:20:28.088]  Gold and silver
[03:20:28.550 --> 03:20:37.374]  Have been a form of currency for 6,000 years compared to our present fiat currency which has only been in existence for 38 years and failing fast.
[03:20:37.374 --> 03:20:45.297]  Call me Dwayne Dally at 800-686-2237 extension 115 to start your protection of wealth today.
[03:20:45.297 --> 03:20:48.718]  I will custom fit the protection package to your personal needs.
[03:20:48.718 --> 03:20:51.479]  No amount is too small so start today.
[03:20:51.479 --> 03:20:53.981]  Call Dwayne Dally with Midas Resources at 800-686-2237 extension 115
[03:21:02.462 --> 03:21:07.707]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:21:08.485 --> 03:21:14.366]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:21:14.366 --> 03:21:20.868]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:21:20.868 --> 03:21:22.848]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:21:22.848 --> 03:21:25.309]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[03:21:25.309 --> 03:21:36.191]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[03:21:38.493 --> 03:21:40.154]  It's not about left or right.
[03:21:40.154 --> 03:21:42.015]  It's about a one world government.
[03:21:42.015 --> 03:21:48.920]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:21:48.920 --> 03:21:57.185]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at Infowars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:21:57.185 --> 03:21:58.766]  The Obama Deception.
[03:21:58.766 --> 03:21:59.947]  The people strike back.
[03:22:01.656 --> 03:22:10.363]  Of the three million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[03:22:10.363 --> 03:22:15.486]  At HempUSA.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the U.S.
[03:22:15.486 --> 03:22:16.347]  and Canada.
[03:22:16.347 --> 03:22:22.892]  At HempUSA.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.
[03:22:23.453 --> 03:22:26.837]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[03:22:26.837 --> 03:22:29.299]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.
[03:22:29.299 --> 03:22:35.886]  This nutrient-dense food can be stored up to five years when vacuum-packed and is priced affordably to be used as a storable food.
[03:22:35.886 --> 03:22:39.430]  HempUSA.org is a bulk shipper starting with five pounds and up.
[03:22:39.430 --> 03:22:43.274]  To allow this food to work for you, call 908-691-2608 or go to HempUSA.org and order today.
[03:22:46.457 --> 03:22:49.622]  The body will react and heal itself given the proper nutrition.
[03:22:49.622 --> 03:22:51.825]  This superfood will be your greatest asset.
[03:22:51.825 --> 03:22:55.491]  So try it today, store it today, and change your life.
[03:22:55.491 --> 03:22:57.213]  Call 908-691-2608 or order from hempusa.org.
[03:23:01.087 --> 03:23:04.488]  Would you give someone $100 for a $10 bill?
[03:23:04.488 --> 03:23:08.929]  If you're taking vitamins and minerals in a pill form, that's exactly what you're doing.
[03:23:08.929 --> 03:23:11.450]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman.
[03:23:11.450 --> 03:23:17.712]  According to the physician's desk reference, many vitamins and minerals in a pill form are 10% absorbed.
[03:23:17.712 --> 03:23:24.034]  It doesn't take a mathematician to figure out for every $100 you spend on these pills, you're flushing $90 down the toilet.
[03:23:25.274 --> 03:23:27.536]  Start absorbing the nutrients you swallow.
[03:23:27.536 --> 03:23:34.902]  Introducing Chews for Health, a delicious tasting chewable containing 16 superfruits, seed vegetables, and antioxidants.
[03:23:34.902 --> 03:23:37.084]  You know, you work hard for your money.
[03:23:37.084 --> 03:23:39.646]  Isn't it time to start getting what you pay for?
[03:23:39.646 --> 03:23:40.386]  Order today!
[03:23:40.386 --> 03:23:40.627]  1-800-210-1922.
[03:23:40.627 --> 03:23:43.949]  With Chews for Health, your body gets to keep the nutrients you swallow.
[03:23:47.532 --> 03:23:53.999]  The first 300 callers are going to receive a free copy of my best-selling CD, America's Unbalanced Diet.
[03:23:53.999 --> 03:23:54.079]  1-800-210-1922.
[03:23:54.079 --> 03:23:54.980]  Or go to orderchoose.com.
[03:24:09.873 --> 03:24:16.820]  They're saying that there's two probable deaths of this new flu in California.
[03:24:16.820 --> 03:24:18.641]  This continues.
[03:24:18.641 --> 03:24:21.704]  They're just going to completely declare martial law.
[03:24:21.704 --> 03:24:27.490]  Now, to explain, it's not fully implemented, but the state of martial law has been activated.
[03:24:27.490 --> 03:24:30.393]  Now will they implement all the facets of that?
[03:24:30.393 --> 03:24:34.376]  And again, it's an AP and Reuters that the UN is commanding and directing the forces.
[03:24:35.457 --> 03:24:36.939]  Just incredible.
[03:24:36.939 --> 03:24:40.462]  This is the type of smokescreen they need to carry out their operations.
[03:24:40.462 --> 03:24:44.686]  Your calls are coming up in the next segment.
[03:24:44.686 --> 03:24:53.695]  The public is really getting concerned and scared, Steve, and we're now hearing that they're going to soon have a special vaccine for all of us.
[03:24:53.695 --> 03:24:56.398]  I mean, this is just ridiculous.
[03:24:57.509 --> 03:25:04.171]  Well, it's ridiculous too, Alex, because Baxter was developing, you know, the slime blue vaccine we talked on the other night.
[03:25:04.171 --> 03:25:06.292]  Obviously, they sent it to 18 nations.
[03:25:06.292 --> 03:25:07.192]  It was infected.
[03:25:07.192 --> 03:25:09.593]  Come on, you've got a deal in such a sterile environment.
[03:25:09.593 --> 03:25:14.075]  I mean, you're talking, you know, BSL, biosafety level 3 at least with that stuff.
[03:25:14.475 --> 03:25:21.319]  And I think it's important to understand this, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that Time Magazine's already prepped Americans for mandatory vaccinations.
[03:25:21.319 --> 03:25:24.040]  I had a time thinking of the lead time it takes.
[03:25:24.040 --> 03:25:25.541]  This whole thing is a setup.
[03:25:25.541 --> 03:25:26.721]  And here's the thing, Alex.
[03:25:26.721 --> 03:25:31.204]  If anybody's going to head anyplace, I'm really concerned about tomorrow night.
[03:25:31.204 --> 03:25:32.484]  I said that on Coast to Coast.
[03:25:32.484 --> 03:25:33.565]  I said it on your show.
[03:25:33.565 --> 03:25:38.327]  Tomorrow night is Walsh-Burgess night, then May Day.
[03:25:38.327 --> 03:25:43.250]  And the fact of Obama's aircraft flying over New York at this time
[03:25:43.710 --> 03:25:48.415]  Given the flu fear, you've got to ask, what kind of a symbol was it?
[03:25:48.415 --> 03:25:49.596]  Have you given much thought to that?
[03:25:49.596 --> 03:26:04.429]  And by the way, Monday you said here, I think it was on Coast to Coast, but I remember you said it on record, that there was no way they didn't know that that would cause a panic, that it was done on purpose, and then they even, with a double meaning, publicly admit it.
[03:26:04.429 --> 03:26:05.590]  It's now public, they admit.
[03:26:06.431 --> 03:26:07.612]  The FBI didn't like it.
[03:26:07.612 --> 03:26:08.532]  The police didn't like it.
[03:26:08.532 --> 03:26:10.333]  They said, don't tell the mayor.
[03:26:10.333 --> 03:26:11.973]  Don't tell the locals.
[03:26:11.973 --> 03:26:13.934]  We're going to do this for a photo op.
[03:26:13.934 --> 03:26:15.095]  And they said, well, what's the photo op?
[03:26:15.095 --> 03:26:16.676]  And they said, you saw it.
[03:26:16.676 --> 03:26:20.437]  And then Obama laughed about it on TV like it was a big joke.
[03:26:20.437 --> 03:26:25.960]  They admit they did this to terrorize people, to bring back the fears of 9-11.
[03:26:27.060 --> 03:26:44.968]  To the occultists believe, and you can think this is kooky, folks, even if you don't believe in the spirituality that globalists do, they believe they have to tell you what they're going to do beforehand, so I guess they're letting us know 9-11 was the White House, 9-11 is the New World Order, 9-11 is us, and you're about to see a new 9-11.
[03:26:44.968 --> 03:26:46.529]  Is that what you're saying the symbolism is?
[03:26:47.149 --> 03:27:06.927]  Absolutely, and even at a deeper level, before you take down a person in some religious belief systems, especially Asian ones, the thing is that you've got to realize that in order to basically capture their essence, now ladies and gentlemen, I don't believe this is a Bible-believing Christian, either does Alex, but these people believe this.
[03:27:06.927 --> 03:27:12.752]  So the fact that someone would laugh at New Yorkers who live with the pain of their lost ones,
[03:27:13.133 --> 03:27:17.873]  This, to me, is in the word of what I would call supernatural demonic mischief, okay?
[03:27:18.602 --> 03:27:27.488]  And remember when, before the President ran, he pulled a bunch of talismans, Alex, out of his pocket and one of them was Hanuman, the Hindu monkey god, you know?
[03:27:27.488 --> 03:27:29.770]  Hanuman, H-A-N-U-M-A-N.
[03:27:29.770 --> 03:27:30.990]  The mischief.
[03:27:30.990 --> 03:27:33.452]  Now here's what people have got to understand.
[03:27:33.452 --> 03:27:38.215]  There is a symbolism that has been telegraphed to the world.
[03:27:38.215 --> 03:27:44.600]  Every time 13 people die in New Zealand, or 13 people die here, whatever the number is,
[03:27:45.280 --> 03:27:45.920]  We're good.
[03:28:02.146 --> 03:28:18.282]  I would say two to three days, but the thing that's happening is that if Mexico continues to truly face the losses that you and I are being told off record, I understand that you've had people call you, doctors, everything Alex, then their economy will collapse.
[03:28:18.646 --> 03:28:20.407]  Well, of all the economies of the world,
[03:28:36.459 --> 03:28:36.699]  I think?
[03:28:52.108 --> 03:29:00.492]  And then perfect timing to make it collapse preemptively so they can bring in the control and make sure the globalists stay in power down there.
[03:29:00.492 --> 03:29:05.414]  So, a controlled destruction, so they're in charge of the destruction.
[03:29:05.414 --> 03:29:10.756]  The more I've analyzed it, the more I've dwelled on it and thought about it, I see that's what's happening.
[03:29:10.756 --> 03:29:18.280]  And as the SPP documents state, North American Union documents, they said they would use a flu or smallpox pandemic to bring in
[03:29:20.361 --> 03:29:25.483]  A centralized regional government in the name of dealing with the crisis.
[03:29:25.483 --> 03:29:26.944]  And now we see the UN saying that.
[03:29:26.944 --> 03:29:27.644]  Steve Quayle, stay there.
[03:29:27.644 --> 03:29:29.445]  We'll get your take on that when we come back.
[03:29:29.445 --> 03:29:34.127]  A recap of top news stories and your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[03:29:34.127 --> 03:29:37.889]  Your phone calls for Steve Quayle, straight ahead.
[03:29:37.889 --> 03:29:41.271]  Jason Burmess will be live tonight, 9 to midnight Central Time.
[03:29:41.271 --> 03:29:43.952]  He's got some guests coming on with key information as well.
[03:29:43.952 --> 03:29:46.793]  So be sure and join the Info Warrior tonight, 9 to midnight.
[03:29:46.793 --> 03:29:47.514]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:47.514 --> 03:29:47.914]  Stay with us.
[03:29:52.021 --> 03:29:53.424]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.424 --> 03:29:55.028]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.028 --> 03:29:58.655]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:02.313 --> 03:30:04.294]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[03:30:04.294 --> 03:30:11.256]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[03:30:11.256 --> 03:30:19.658]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[03:30:19.658 --> 03:30:25.380]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[03:30:25.780 --> 03:30:27.381]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[03:30:27.381 --> 03:30:29.563]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[03:30:29.563 --> 03:30:34.106]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[03:30:34.106 --> 03:30:36.327]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[03:30:36.327 --> 03:30:44.092]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[03:31:02.248 --> 03:31:07.493]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:31:08.067 --> 03:31:15.629]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:31:15.629 --> 03:31:22.150]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:31:22.150 --> 03:31:24.190]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:31:24.190 --> 03:31:26.691]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:31:26.691 --> 03:31:37.633]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:31:38.268 --> 03:31:39.929]  It's not about left or right.
[03:31:39.929 --> 03:31:41.789]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:31:41.789 --> 03:31:48.712]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:31:48.712 --> 03:31:56.956]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:31:56.956 --> 03:31:58.536]  The Obama Deception.
[03:31:58.536 --> 03:31:59.737]  The people strike back.
[03:32:02.665 --> 03:32:03.807]  You are a rebel.
[03:32:03.807 --> 03:32:04.548]  Admit it.
[03:32:04.548 --> 03:32:07.533]  You refuse to read the directions when assembling a new item.
[03:32:07.533 --> 03:32:09.917]  You won't ask for directions when you're lost.
[03:32:09.917 --> 03:32:13.863]  Once in a while, you drive in the carpool lane with only you in the car.
[03:32:13.863 --> 03:32:15.446]  Your neighbors call you a crackpot.
[03:32:18.626 --> 03:32:19.346]  Join the club.
[03:32:19.346 --> 03:32:25.569]  Einstein failed math, quit school, and his rebel ideas led to some of the world's most amazing discoveries.
[03:32:25.569 --> 03:32:30.211]  Edison rebelled against the dark, failed over a thousand times, then invented the light bulb.
[03:32:30.211 --> 03:32:34.973]  George Washington rebelled against an entire country and led the creation of a new one.
[03:32:34.973 --> 03:32:38.215]  Now, Alex Jones is working to save that very country.
[03:32:38.215 --> 03:32:39.755]  So go ahead, be a rebel.
[03:32:39.755 --> 03:32:42.577]  Put in a food supply from efoodsdirect.com.
[03:32:42.577 --> 03:32:43.617]  Everyone will realize
[03:32:43.697 --> 03:32:44.057]  That's 800-409-5633.
[03:33:16.553 --> 03:33:19.115]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[03:33:19.115 --> 03:33:20.095]  until 3 p.m.
[03:33:20.095 --> 03:33:21.556]  Central Standard Time.
[03:33:21.556 --> 03:33:22.997]  We are live here.
[03:33:22.997 --> 03:33:27.420]  When we come back, Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:33:27.420 --> 03:33:30.782]  with an abbreviated Friends Mission.
[03:33:30.782 --> 03:33:33.504]  Steve Quayle is our guest for another 26 minutes.
[03:33:35.336 --> 03:33:39.517]  We'll definitely get an update from him this Friday or coming up Monday, maybe even the Sunday show.
[03:33:39.517 --> 03:33:42.237]  We'll set that up if he can do that with us.
[03:33:42.237 --> 03:33:48.399]  I want to go to Randy, Ronnie, Dan, Dale, Roland, Pedro in Mexico.
[03:33:48.399 --> 03:33:52.119]  We'll go to Pedro in Mexico here in just a moment.
[03:33:52.119 --> 03:33:53.580]  SteveQuell.com is the website.
[03:33:53.580 --> 03:33:58.781]  We'll put that web address and spelling up on screen at PrisonPlanet.tv for folks.
[03:33:58.781 --> 03:33:59.401]  Please remember,
[03:34:01.129 --> 03:34:10.071]  We know that if what they're saying about this flu, that it's only killed a couple hundred in Mexico and one person that we know of here in the US, that's total hype.
[03:34:10.071 --> 03:34:18.274]  It's a psy-op to sell vaccines and with their history of what they put in vaccines, woe unto he that takes it.
[03:34:18.274 --> 03:34:19.154]  He's a eugenicist.
[03:34:21.360 --> 03:34:25.883]  And they're using it to train us to hear about troops on the streets, lockdown of cities, martial law.
[03:34:25.883 --> 03:34:27.865]  Time Magazine and Newsweek are both writing articles.
[03:34:27.865 --> 03:34:31.568]  We got them posted at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com saying,
[03:34:33.422 --> 03:34:35.804]  Force inoculations coming, do what the government says.
[03:34:35.804 --> 03:34:37.325]  If this continues, it's going to happen.
[03:34:37.325 --> 03:34:43.510]  They're introducing, they're acclimating, they're baptizing you in this tyranny while leaving the borders wide open.
[03:34:43.510 --> 03:34:46.773]  So that is their agenda we know right now.
[03:34:46.773 --> 03:34:51.336]  We're hoping this doesn't mutate or that they've covered up how many it's really killing.
[03:34:51.336 --> 03:34:56.480]  A lot of people have flu-like symptoms here in Austin, Texas, and it's not psychosomatic or placebo.
[03:34:56.480 --> 03:34:58.862]  They're not, you know, it's not psychological.
[03:34:58.862 --> 03:35:00.023]  They're not imagining it.
[03:35:00.023 --> 03:35:01.144]  They're not hypochondriacs.
[03:35:01.144 --> 03:35:02.245]  You know, they're sick.
[03:35:03.749 --> 03:35:08.913]  Quite a few people that I know in my office have sick family or sick friends or sick bandmates.
[03:35:08.913 --> 03:35:15.017]  And, uh, it's to the point of my children are already homeschooled.
[03:35:15.017 --> 03:35:18.320]  But, I mean, I don't like getting into the fear.
[03:35:18.320 --> 03:35:22.783]  It is a precaution, but I know that even then trying to do that feeds into it all.
[03:35:24.454 --> 03:35:30.176]  The biggest issue here is that we have to remember who the globalists are and what they've done in the past and go from there.
[03:35:30.176 --> 03:35:40.178]  But we can't forget they've got a treaty to ban reloading, to register gun owners, to register any changes you make to a firearm like putting a new barrel in or having something fixed at a gunsmith.
[03:35:40.178 --> 03:35:41.739]  Just incredible stuff happening there.
[03:35:41.739 --> 03:35:44.479]  They're trying to pass the carbon taxes right now.
[03:35:44.479 --> 03:35:45.720]  All of this is going on.
[03:35:46.824 --> 03:35:49.045]  All of this is happening right now.
[03:35:49.045 --> 03:35:53.267]  And so folks have to ask themselves, are they going to be diverted and distracted?
[03:35:53.267 --> 03:35:54.508]  And we're going to be covering this bird flu.
[03:35:54.508 --> 03:35:57.170]  We're going to be covering this designer pig flu, whatever it is.
[03:35:57.170 --> 03:36:00.171]  We're going to be covering it a lot.
[03:36:00.171 --> 03:36:08.315]  Bird flu, pig flu, human flu, lab flu, created flu, government flu, new world order flu, whatever you want to call it.
[03:36:08.315 --> 03:36:10.737]  But at the same time, we're going to keep pointing out what is being
[03:36:11.823 --> 03:36:15.548]  Distracted from what people are not seeing, what they're not looking at.
[03:36:15.548 --> 03:36:17.551]  So, continue to wake people up.
[03:36:17.551 --> 03:36:22.758]  And remember, during this crisis, you can use the enemy's own crisis creation to wake people up.
[03:36:22.758 --> 03:36:24.380]  Folks are ready to listen right now.
[03:36:24.380 --> 03:36:26.423]  We have record listeners on AM and FM stations.
[03:36:26.423 --> 03:36:28.285]  They say they've never got so much feedback.
[03:36:28.826 --> 03:36:33.808]  You know, the ratings only come out every quarter, but we can tell it's record listeners on AM and FM stations.
[03:36:33.808 --> 03:36:40.850]  The internet, we've got about 40%, 50% more listeners right now to the podcast, the live streams, all of it.
[03:36:40.850 --> 03:36:45.032]  Number one on Shoutcast, Talk Radio and Music every day this week.
[03:36:45.032 --> 03:36:47.813]  Even last week, just amazing stuff happening.
[03:36:47.813 --> 03:36:49.833]  And that's not even all our streams that you see there.
[03:36:49.833 --> 03:36:51.874]  All of them don't show up for some reason.
[03:36:51.874 --> 03:36:56.616]  So, this is a very exciting time to be alive, and if we reach out and expose the enemy,
[03:36:57.276 --> 03:37:01.299]  Then their attempt, the pit they've dug for us is something they'll fall into.
[03:37:01.299 --> 03:37:04.360]  So please go to InfoWars.com, get the Obama deception.
[03:37:04.360 --> 03:37:07.102]  Get Truth Rising, Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[03:37:07.102 --> 03:37:10.684]  Give Endgame to people on DVD and say, this is what's really going on.
[03:37:10.684 --> 03:37:12.165]  This is who the globalists are.
[03:37:12.165 --> 03:37:13.026]  Now is the time.
[03:37:13.026 --> 03:37:15.908]  So again, InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to do that.
[03:37:15.908 --> 03:37:18.269]  You can find out a lot more about the great book Steve Quell's written.
[03:37:18.269 --> 03:37:22.071]  Steve, tell folks about SteveQuell.com and some of the books you've written.
[03:37:22.071 --> 03:37:24.473]  People really want to get an idea on what we're facing.
[03:37:25.452 --> 03:37:29.637]  First of all, it's Steve, Q-U-A-Y-L-E dot com, and thank you, Alex.
[03:37:29.637 --> 03:37:40.371]  One of the books that was the most telling and impressive was Breathe No Evil, because I had made the statement on National Talk Radio prior to the Aum Shinrikyo release of sarin nerve gas in Tokyo.
[03:37:41.051 --> 03:38:05.440]  Subway that within two weeks or be a biological or chemical event that kind of launched me into the world of maybe some people should pay attention to what I have to say over the years I've developed a lot of sources interviewed a lot of different people across the spectrum from scientists Russian spies weapons trading specialists people that most people read about novels, but don't know they exist in reality and
[03:38:06.180 --> 03:38:09.163]  Double agents, both for Russia and the U.S.
[03:38:09.163 --> 03:38:14.087]  The common denominator, Alex, in all this stuff was how stupid can the American people be?
[03:38:14.087 --> 03:38:16.749]  It's not one thing to hear it from a Russian.
[03:38:16.749 --> 03:38:21.974]  It's another thing to hear it from your own supposed number one top spy during the Cold War.
[03:38:21.974 --> 03:38:23.535]  And you see what's going on.
[03:38:23.535 --> 03:38:25.096]  And can I share something with you?
[03:38:25.096 --> 03:38:28.359]  Even the Russians, the old-time spies, this was given to me about 24 hours ago,
[03:38:29.580 --> 03:38:30.341]  We're good to go.
[03:38:43.405 --> 03:38:45.986]  And I dealt with these types of issues in the book.
[03:38:45.986 --> 03:38:50.387]  I wrote Breathe No Evil, which my webmaster, Dolly Dale, told me.
[03:38:50.387 --> 03:38:53.288]  I printed that, or had it published in 1996.
[03:38:53.288 --> 03:38:55.488]  At that time, no publisher would take it.
[03:38:55.488 --> 03:39:06.171]  They said it was crazy, no one was interested, and I said, you mark my words, this will be the topic of the day, and it will be so important that you guys will say, in retrospect, even which you would have
[03:39:06.672 --> 03:39:13.809]  In fact, Horowitz gave you credit for being probably the first person other than himself to really tell what's happening.
[03:39:14.264 --> 03:39:26.629]  Yes, and the thing that's interesting about that is then, you know, the hot zone came out, then the coming plague by Lori Garrett and all those things, but see, again, what we're doing, we're trying to share this, you know, I figured it out.
[03:39:26.629 --> 03:39:33.172]  You and I and others that have been on the cutting edge for all these years, Alex, we're like the bow of an icebreaker, okay?
[03:39:33.172 --> 03:39:34.412]  We have to hit the ice.
[03:39:34.412 --> 03:39:38.614]  We get the hardest hits first, and then the rest of the ship can come along, okay?
[03:39:38.994 --> 03:39:53.684]  And what we're trying to do is warn those who have ears to hear, eyes to see, that the good ship lollipop, the United States of America, as they have known, it is going down because the globalists want all national identity to be absolutely dissolved.
[03:39:53.684 --> 03:40:00.468]  The global suprastate, which the United Nations is going to officiate over, is absolutely coming on the scene.
[03:40:09.074 --> 03:40:24.279]  From a major newspaper in Florida, and all over the country, foreign troop drills in Arizona, foreign troop drills going on in Wisconsin, foreign troop drills in California, suddenly regular army running checkpoints in Tennessee and California and Michigan.
[03:40:24.279 --> 03:40:28.641]  All of this is just calmly going on everywhere.
[03:40:28.641 --> 03:40:31.702]  In fact, we're going to go to your calls in a moment, but back this up.
[03:40:31.702 --> 03:40:33.422]  Let's go ahead and play the audio.
[03:40:33.422 --> 03:40:35.043]  Listen to how they just announced this.
[03:40:36.434 --> 03:40:39.515]  Like, this is from the newspaper's video.
[03:40:39.515 --> 03:40:40.356]  What newspaper is this?
[03:40:40.356 --> 03:40:43.017]  It's the Fort Myers, isn't it?
[03:40:43.017 --> 03:40:47.178]  This is the Fort Myers... I had it printed off, but I can't find it.
[03:40:47.178 --> 03:40:49.619]  Yeah, so it's the Florida Times Union.
[03:40:49.619 --> 03:40:50.420]  There you go.
[03:40:50.420 --> 03:40:51.660]  Florida Times Union.
[03:40:51.660 --> 03:40:54.541]  The headline, Marines and multinational forces train in Florida.
[03:40:54.541 --> 03:40:54.922]  There it is.
[03:40:54.922 --> 03:40:57.923]  I'll link to it up on InfoWars.com.
[03:40:57.923 --> 03:41:00.364]  They're just calmly, oh, the U.N.
[03:41:00.364 --> 03:41:02.245]  is directing the U.S.
[03:41:02.245 --> 03:41:02.865]  The who is?
[03:41:04.090 --> 03:41:04.610]  The WHO?
[03:41:04.610 --> 03:41:07.313]  Yeah, the New World Order, the World Health Organization.
[03:41:07.313 --> 03:41:10.676]  So, here's that clip since you brought it up.
[03:41:10.676 --> 03:41:12.337]  Only a few minutes long, then we'll go to calls.
[03:41:12.337 --> 03:41:13.738]  Steve Quayle is our guest.
[03:41:13.738 --> 03:41:14.219]  Here it is.
[03:41:14.219 --> 03:41:15.120]  Watch that screen.
[03:41:17.961 --> 03:41:22.083]  It's a great opportunity to always observe the Navy Marine Corps team do something together.
[03:41:22.083 --> 03:41:25.604]  That's Rear Admiral Joseph Kernan, Commander of the U.S.
[03:41:25.604 --> 03:41:27.244]  Naval Forces Southern Command.
[03:41:27.244 --> 03:41:27.565]  The U.S.
[03:41:27.565 --> 03:41:36.688]  Navy Marine Corps team is being joined by the Inventaria di Emilia from many countries throughout the Latin American region.
[03:41:36.688 --> 03:41:38.108]  So it's a really historic event for us.
[03:41:38.108 --> 03:41:40.589]  I think, personally, I think it's been a long time coming.
[03:41:40.589 --> 03:41:47.872]  It's important because it demonstrates the importance of the relationships between our countries and how important it is for us to continue
[03:41:47.892 --> 03:41:48.932]  We continue to work together.
[03:41:48.932 --> 03:41:51.153]  An amphibious demonstration, basically.
[03:41:51.153 --> 03:41:52.934]  We have Marine Corps, U.S.
[03:41:52.934 --> 03:42:01.877]  Marine Corps, we have Partner Nation Marine Corps coming off the USS Ashland and USS Mesa Verde to do what we call an amphibious demonstration.
[03:42:01.877 --> 03:42:17.522]  As you noticed, there was various landing craft, LCACs, and AAVs, as well as the Osprey and CH-46 helicopters and CH-60 helicopters coming in a synchronized demonstration of a landing force.
[03:42:18.323 --> 03:42:19.264]  And it was not just the U.S.
[03:42:19.264 --> 03:42:22.706]  Marine Landing Force, it was a joint landing force of U.S.
[03:42:22.706 --> 03:42:24.467]  Marine Corps and partner nations.
[03:42:24.467 --> 03:42:25.968]  How many partner nations?
[03:42:25.968 --> 03:42:30.750]  We have 11 partner nations, not including the U.S.
[03:42:30.750 --> 03:42:33.092]  12 total nations participating in UNITAS Gold.
[03:42:34.528 --> 03:42:36.929]  How do you think the people on the beach enjoyed it?
[03:42:36.929 --> 03:42:39.849]  I think with all the cheers I heard afterwards, they enjoyed it.
[03:42:39.849 --> 03:42:53.213]  I don't know if they totally expected everything, especially all the Marine Corps people coming out of the AAVs with guns drawn and doing a landing, but I think they got a kick out of it.
[03:42:53.213 --> 03:42:54.953]  What did you think of the attack?
[03:42:54.953 --> 03:42:57.774]  Look at that!
[03:42:57.774 --> 03:43:02.615]  All those tanks are like torn in mid, so like... Have you ever seen anything like it before?
[03:43:04.221 --> 03:43:05.142]  Yes.
[03:43:05.142 --> 03:43:05.982]  Yes.
[03:43:05.982 --> 03:43:11.165]  Good-bye Naval career, but I gotta tell you, this was well done.
[03:43:11.165 --> 03:43:11.825]  There it is.
[03:43:11.825 --> 03:43:16.708]  I saw it in Oakland, and the Marines were with foreign troops trying to take our guns.
[03:43:16.708 --> 03:43:18.389]  It's called Police Day 2000.
[03:43:18.389 --> 03:43:25.212]  And people were so shocked in 99 when I released that, they thought I hired hovercraft, Marines, tanks, and there were thousands of them.
[03:43:25.212 --> 03:43:26.033]  Imagine if the
[03:43:27.309 --> 03:43:29.770]  If the public there saw the gun confiscation drills they do.
[03:43:29.770 --> 03:43:31.970]  Now listen, this is all done to acclimate.
[03:43:31.970 --> 03:43:33.911]  They admit they're preparing to use foreign troops.
[03:43:33.911 --> 03:43:37.232]  They've signed official deals with the Canadians and Mexicans.
[03:43:37.232 --> 03:43:43.754]  Remember in Katrina, they brought in Mexican troops and it's the first time since the 1860s, Mexican troops coming back into Texas.
[03:43:44.514 --> 03:43:47.316]  Well, I think Alex, this is absolutely in our face now.
[03:44:02.907 --> 03:44:11.730]  And the deal is that people better understand that when Henry Kissinger made the statement by September, there'd be no private firearms ownership and that this is what's going down.
[03:44:11.730 --> 03:44:22.113]  Listen, I want to give all you guys in Austin a heads up, too, because Austin has, as you know, so many retired military and a lot of the old guys that still love the country.
[03:44:22.113 --> 03:44:26.415]  When I say old, I don't put that in anything outside of respect.
[03:44:26.915 --> 03:44:38.305]  But I would say this, that groups in Austin that have been at war with other groups should take notice that there are indications that your area is going to get hit.
[03:44:38.305 --> 03:44:45.030]  I'm not trying to be vague or melodramatic, but just beware of that, because the New World Order people, they show no mercy.
[03:44:45.030 --> 03:44:49.014]  Obviously, that's an attribute of God, and their God, Satan, doesn't show any of that.
[03:44:49.014 --> 03:44:54.078]  So the point is that it's going to be very, very critical, seriously, that
[03:44:54.478 --> 03:45:03.244]  That people who are retired military in the special forces, special operations community, the people that have been green berets, everybody take note of this.
[03:45:03.244 --> 03:45:20.855]  You know, Alex, when I gave the orange alert, it was only days, and I'm not just saying that it was days because of my orange alert, but when people are dispatched to go and GPS everybody that attends the tea parties, and they're using facial recognition software, you and I talked about that goes up satellite, and within one hour,
[03:45:21.515 --> 03:45:29.461]  One hour someone's dispatched, in many cases, that can never, you know, that type of effectiveness never exists in a federal organization.
[03:45:29.461 --> 03:45:33.683]  It has to be higher up, someone's controlling it, who is a military background.
[03:45:33.683 --> 03:45:37.266]  And I think you and I both know who's controlling, quote, the census takers.
[03:45:37.266 --> 03:45:39.407]  They're not census takers, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:45:39.407 --> 03:45:46.612]  They're just double-verifying who lives where when these people that Alex and I are talking about, he just played the clip,
[03:45:46.992 --> 03:45:48.232]  These are the people that are coming.
[03:45:48.232 --> 03:45:49.553]  I have four-star generals.
[03:45:49.553 --> 03:45:56.655]  No, no, they admit in that FEMA report and the DHS report, the one that got all the attention, we just got another FBI one.
[03:45:56.655 --> 03:45:57.415]  Ooh, it's really wild.
[03:45:57.415 --> 03:45:59.015]  We're going to have that tomorrow.
[03:45:59.015 --> 03:46:00.476]  Copies are already outside the office.
[03:46:00.476 --> 03:46:01.956]  You can't stop it getting out.
[03:46:01.956 --> 03:46:03.116]  We've got it ready to load right now.
[03:46:03.116 --> 03:46:04.397]  We're just going to do a report tomorrow.
[03:46:07.478 --> 03:46:13.543]  They are, in those reports, talking about how they have intelligence on the gun owners.
[03:46:13.543 --> 03:46:26.773]  They admit, in the secret reports that mention the more classified reports, that they're surveilling gun owners, Christians, Ron Paul supporters, libertarians, and veterans, and that Homeland Security is for us!
[03:46:28.618 --> 03:46:32.259]  It's astonishing, and then, again, let me finish up one thought.
[03:46:32.259 --> 03:46:39.062]  I've gotten challenged for over 10 years the amount of people in this country, NATO troops that have been bivouacked, placing all the bases at George Bush Sr.
[03:46:39.062 --> 03:46:40.082]  closed down.
[03:46:40.082 --> 03:46:49.005]  My number, from multi-star generals across the board and spies on both sides of the former Iron Curtain, 345,000.
[03:46:49.005 --> 03:46:51.746]  So just because, ladies and gentlemen, you don't see them,
[03:46:52.146 --> 03:46:54.107]  Look, these people are professionals.
[03:46:54.107 --> 03:47:00.711]  There are a lot of bases, any military base that was closed down, worth its salt, had extensive underground facilities to prepare for nuclear war.
[03:47:00.711 --> 03:47:12.118]  Well, most of these people have jobs, we've confirmed, in intelligence, where they'll be working at a pizza place, a factory, and they're pre-placed, you know, stay-behind teams.
[03:47:12.118 --> 03:47:15.661]  But instead of a stay-behind team, they've always been here and they work for the UN.
[03:47:15.661 --> 03:47:16.701]  Let's take calls.
[03:47:16.701 --> 03:47:18.422]  Let's talk to Pedro in Mexico.
[03:47:18.422 --> 03:47:20.824]  Pedro, what can you tell us about what's happening down there?
[03:47:23.564 --> 03:47:24.965]  Hi Alex, hi everybody.
[03:47:24.965 --> 03:47:25.745]  Good, thanks for calling.
[03:47:25.745 --> 03:47:26.746]  I'm calling from Queretaro.
[03:47:26.746 --> 03:47:28.907]  It's a million people.
[03:47:28.907 --> 03:47:30.248]  It's a million people town.
[03:47:30.248 --> 03:47:33.090]  It's about a hundred miles north of Mexico City.
[03:47:33.090 --> 03:47:34.931]  Okay, say the name again because I was cutting you off.
[03:47:34.931 --> 03:47:38.374]  You're from where?
[03:47:38.374 --> 03:47:39.574]  It's Queretaro.
[03:47:39.574 --> 03:47:40.975]  Okay, there's a delay.
[03:47:40.975 --> 03:47:45.518]  Okay, tell us what you're seeing, sir.
[03:47:45.518 --> 03:47:51.682]  Okay, well I see people in the streets, about 10 to 20 percent of the people wear the surgical masks.
[03:47:51.682 --> 03:47:53.023]  And basically they've created a lot of
[03:47:53.609 --> 03:47:55.911]  I have no fear and hysteria of what they show on the mainstream TV here.
[03:47:55.911 --> 03:47:57.552]  I have no fear and hysteria of what they show on the mainstream TV here.
[03:47:57.552 --> 03:47:59.373]  I have no fear and hysteria of what they show on the mainstream TV here.
[03:47:59.373 --> 03:48:01.354]  I have no fear and hysteria of what they show on the mainstream TV here.
[03:48:01.354 --> 03:48:03.056]  I have no fear and hysteria of what they show on the mainstream TV here.
[03:48:03.056 --> 03:48:04.877]  I have no fear and hysteria of what they show on the mainstream TV here.
[03:48:04.877 --> 03:48:06.418]  I have no fear and hysteria of what they show on the mainstream TV here.
[03:48:06.418 --> 03:48:08.639]  I have no fear and hysteria of what they show on the mainstream TV here.
[03:48:08.639 --> 03:48:11.361]  I have no fear and hysteria of what they show on the mainstream TV here.
[03:48:11.361 --> 03:48:12.802]  I have no fear and hysteria of what they show on the mainstream TV here.
[03:48:12.802 --> 03:48:14.504]  I have no fear and hysteria of what they show on the mainstream TV here.
[03:48:14.504 --> 03:48:16.185]  I have no fear and hysteria of what they show on the mainstream TV here.
[03:48:16.185 --> 03:48:17.806]  I have no fear and hysteria of what they show on the mainstream TV here.
[03:48:17.806 --> 03:48:18.046]  I have no
[03:48:19.897 --> 03:48:22.578]  As far as I'm concerned, Mexico's economy was chugging along.
[03:48:22.578 --> 03:48:34.344]  I think it was holding better than the U.S., but even with the higher taxation measures that the latest Mexican IRS implemented in the last 12 months.
[03:48:34.344 --> 03:48:36.805]  That's right, I've read they want to squeeze more taxes out of people.
[03:48:36.805 --> 03:48:43.168]  It says the Mexican government is going to start taking SDRs, that's the new global currency, from the IMF.
[03:48:43.168 --> 03:48:45.309]  And I guess they've got to then squeeze it out of you poor folks.
[03:48:48.567 --> 03:48:56.011]  Yeah, every year they put new measures and they make it, you know, harder to not pay taxes or every time they force us to pay more.
[03:48:56.011 --> 03:49:14.240]  However, there was a very interesting article this morning and yesterday evening in the Reforma newspaper, which is one of the mainstream newspapers in Mexico City, where they quoted the Secretary of Health saying that only 26 cases of flu have been absolutely confirmed to be related to the swine flu.
[03:49:14.240 --> 03:49:17.041]  And only 7 deaths have been absolutely confirmed.
[03:49:18.371 --> 03:49:21.893]  He says that they have a total of 2,400.
[03:49:21.893 --> 03:49:28.515]  They have a total of 2,498 cases of a typical pneumonia, of which 159 have resulted in death.
[03:49:28.515 --> 03:49:32.877]  These 159 deaths are the ones that CNN is reporting.
[03:49:32.877 --> 03:49:34.918]  Yes, yes, absolutely.
[03:49:34.918 --> 03:49:37.119]  How many people?
[03:49:37.119 --> 03:49:39.160]  Go ahead.
[03:49:39.160 --> 03:49:42.801]  I don't know how many people have, you know, been to these poor hospitals in Mexico.
[03:49:43.376 --> 03:49:49.418]  But I can tell you, I mean, they're very humble and simple, and they have no way to know what virus is killing them.
[03:49:49.418 --> 03:50:04.264]  I mean, all they know is that these people are dying from pneumonia, and all the doctors, you know, they start hearing, oh my God, the swine flu, so they must attribute these atypical pneumonia cases to this swine flu virus.
[03:50:04.264 --> 03:50:07.265]  And now they want to use... That's another point that I've noticed.
[03:50:07.265 --> 03:50:07.565]  Go ahead.
[03:50:09.983 --> 03:50:15.045]  Okay, the other point I've noticed is I've been following chemtrails in Mexico since May 1997.
[03:50:15.045 --> 03:50:19.106]  In fact, when I started seeing them, nobody knew what they were here.
[03:50:19.106 --> 03:50:22.167]  I had seen pictures of the chemtrails in the U.S.
[03:50:22.167 --> 03:50:28.229]  and I think I was one of the first websites that were placed regarding chemtrails.
[03:50:28.229 --> 03:50:31.890]  And so I've been very, you know, tracking them ever since.
[03:50:32.475 --> 03:50:45.170]  And one of the things I've noticed is that in the last 90 days approximately, the chemical spraying, at least in a hundred mile radius of where I'm located, has been just two or three hundred percent, uh, you know, harder.
[03:50:45.788 --> 03:50:50.052]  I mean, I got friends with little kids, and I'm talking about people that are not poor.
[03:50:50.052 --> 03:50:57.880]  I mean, I'm talking about people that at least have, you know, resources that will equal the average, you know, a middle-class American, you know, private health care.
[03:50:57.880 --> 03:50:58.600]  Stay there, stay there.
[03:50:58.600 --> 03:50:59.201]  I want to hear more.
[03:50:59.201 --> 03:50:59.802]  We got a break.
[03:50:59.802 --> 03:51:00.502]  Stay there.
[03:51:00.502 --> 03:51:02.004]  Maybe we'll do some overdrive with Steve Quayle.
[03:51:02.004 --> 03:51:07.289]  Did you catch the ABC 2020 show and how record unemployment has increased the work-at-home scams?
[03:51:07.549 --> 03:51:11.532]  Titillating ads lure people in, claiming they can make hundreds a day.
[03:51:11.532 --> 03:51:15.275]  You'll never hear that from our friends at IncomeAtHome45.com.
[03:51:15.275 --> 03:51:19.098]  And it's their integrity that's made them a work-from-home leader.
[03:51:19.098 --> 03:51:24.642]  IncomeAtHome45.com is accredited by the Better Business Bureau, and has an A-plus rating.
[03:51:24.642 --> 03:51:25.923]  That's your peace of mind.
[03:51:25.923 --> 03:51:32.028]  They're connected to a multi-billion dollar company, doing business in 70 countries for nearly 30 years.
[03:51:32.028 --> 03:51:37.352]  If your dream is to work from home, to stay home, and raise your family, to insulate yourself from this economy,
[03:51:37.552 --> 03:51:39.292]  In the New World Order's War Against Humanity,
[03:52:05.820 --> 03:52:07.878]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:52:08.670 --> 03:52:14.533]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:52:14.533 --> 03:52:21.035]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:21.035 --> 03:52:23.016]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:23.016 --> 03:52:25.477]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[03:52:25.477 --> 03:52:36.362]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[03:52:38.664 --> 03:52:40.324]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:40.324 --> 03:52:42.185]  It's about a one world government.
[03:52:42.185 --> 03:52:49.086]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:52:49.086 --> 03:52:57.348]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:52:57.348 --> 03:52:58.928]  The Obama Deception.
[03:52:58.928 --> 03:53:03.730]  The people strike back.
[03:53:03.730 --> 03:53:05.930]  With rising unemployment and an economy
[03:53:10.643 --> 03:53:11.787]  I don't think so.
[03:53:24.258 --> 03:53:24.778]  We're good to go.
[03:53:48.351 --> 03:53:49.872]  That's MRDefense.com or call 1-800-313-6400.
[03:53:49.872 --> 03:53:49.973]  1-800-313-6400.
[03:53:49.973 --> 03:53:50.593]  That's 1-800-313-6400 today!
[03:53:50.593 --> 03:53:51.954]  Look, I have meetings, work to do, a new FBI.
[03:54:15.120 --> 03:54:20.684]  Training material that'll make the MIAC and the DHS thing look pale.
[03:54:20.684 --> 03:54:21.944]  All the other things we broke.
[03:54:21.944 --> 03:54:23.465]  Keep sending it, folks.
[03:54:23.465 --> 03:54:24.286]  We'll keep vetting it.
[03:54:24.286 --> 03:54:27.368]  I gotta call the FBI, make sure it is their stuff, and a bunch of other things.
[03:54:27.368 --> 03:54:28.549]  That's for tomorrow.
[03:54:28.549 --> 03:54:31.490]  We're going into overtime for 20 minutes.
[03:54:31.490 --> 03:54:39.575]  I'm gonna let Steve go, but it'll be PrisonPlanet.tv, viewers only, and InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com audio stream listeners.
[03:54:39.575 --> 03:54:41.697]  When this airs in the rebroadcast, it won't re-air.
[03:54:41.697 --> 03:54:43.018]  Just the regular four hours will.
[03:54:44.428 --> 03:54:51.398]  We're going to keep going live when the show ends for the MNFM, but it will be on the end of the free podcast you can subscribe to at Infowars.com.
[03:55:01.380 --> 03:55:09.963]  Sherry Tinpenny read this yesterday on air but didn't read from the document itself and the UN has said this is global government.
[03:55:09.963 --> 03:55:12.224]  They can tell nations what to do, anything.
[03:55:12.224 --> 03:55:14.165]  Burmese has this from the UN.
[03:55:14.165 --> 03:55:15.486]  We have a strategic flu plan.
[03:55:15.486 --> 03:55:18.447]  We're going to talk about that next hour with Steve Quayle.
[03:55:18.447 --> 03:55:20.368]  Internet only at Infowars.com.
[03:55:21.528 --> 03:55:23.429]  I want to end with Pedro and Steve Quayle right now.
[03:55:23.429 --> 03:55:28.831]  Steve's been gracious enough to stay another 20 minutes, but we are ending it 20 minutes in, because again, I have stuff I've got to do as well.
[03:55:28.831 --> 03:55:34.474]  I want to tell you about two sponsors that made the show possible before we finish up with Pedro about the chemtrails.
[03:55:34.474 --> 03:55:36.075]  It's probably chemtrails making people sick.
[03:55:36.075 --> 03:55:37.676]  It's probably not even the flu.
[03:55:37.676 --> 03:55:40.397]  You never know with these liars, and the vaccine will be what the problem is.
[03:55:42.233 --> 03:55:44.798]  I want to tell folks about the ringtones.
[03:55:44.798 --> 03:55:51.310]  If you go to InfoWars.com, down the right-hand side of the page, there's a link that goes to the AlexJonesRingtones.net.
[03:55:52.571 --> 03:55:54.092]  In fact, let's put that up on screen.
[03:55:54.092 --> 03:55:55.993]  AlexJonesRingtones.net.
[03:55:55.993 --> 03:55:57.754]  And it's a company putting out ringtones.
[03:55:57.754 --> 03:55:58.894]  Everybody asks for these.
[03:55:58.894 --> 03:56:00.975]  You want them, you got them.
[03:56:00.975 --> 03:56:02.136]  Great way.
[03:56:02.136 --> 03:56:02.916]  Just go listen to them.
[03:56:02.916 --> 03:56:05.177]  It's all the funniest, most interesting stuff I've said.
[03:56:05.177 --> 03:56:08.018]  Kind of like, Obama!
[03:56:08.018 --> 03:56:09.999]  Obama!
[03:56:09.999 --> 03:56:11.220]  Obama!
[03:56:11.220 --> 03:56:15.442]  I never have to buy a car or pay my house payment again!
[03:56:15.442 --> 03:56:17.003]  Obama!
[03:56:17.363 --> 03:56:21.490]  You know, that kind of stuff is up there right now on the InfoWars.com.
[03:56:21.490 --> 03:56:23.173]  We've added the ringtone store.
[03:56:23.173 --> 03:56:23.714]  You can go halfway.
[03:56:25.762 --> 03:56:29.363]  Down on the page, right on the right-hand side, link through to that.
[03:56:29.363 --> 03:56:30.123]  Hope you get those.
[03:56:30.123 --> 03:56:32.164]  And then lastly, Home Gain.
[03:56:32.164 --> 03:56:34.385]  H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N dot com.
[03:56:34.385 --> 03:56:36.706]  H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N dot com.
[03:56:36.706 --> 03:56:46.329]  They've got a free home maximizer, which goes and tells you what the most inexpensive things to do to your house are that boost the sell value the most.
[03:56:46.329 --> 03:56:49.310]  It's got a thing where you put your address in for free and it tells you.
[03:56:50.410 --> 03:56:52.452]  We're almost over for the main transmission.
[03:56:52.452 --> 03:56:54.693]  You gotta go over to the internet streams at InfoWars.com only.
[03:57:13.988 --> 03:57:38.580]  Yes, basically what's happening is that the chemtrail spraying has been increasing this last three months, and I've seen how people are getting sick with these flus that last, you know, a month, you know, and they take a lot of effort to cure.
[03:57:39.099 --> 03:57:44.865]  So what's happening now is that they've created this fear and hysteria and everybody thinks that they get these, you know, regular...
[03:57:45.959 --> 03:58:02.588]  A typical, if you want, because of the timing of the year, but probably because of these chemtrails, and everybody thinks, oh my god, I'm infected with influenza, or the swine flu, because they have, you know, temperature, and they have, you know, a... I mean, shit, I felt like that just... All right, sir, I appreciate your call.
[03:58:02.588 --> 03:58:04.249]  Appreciate your call.
[03:58:04.249 --> 03:58:07.911]  We're going to end the main transmission right now with GCN.
[03:58:07.911 --> 03:58:10.112]  Steve Quill, you're there on our phone system, correct, sir?
[03:58:10.112 --> 03:58:11.293]  Yes, I'll wait for you, Alex.
[03:58:12.142 --> 03:58:13.903]  Okay, fantastic.
[03:58:13.903 --> 03:58:21.648]  We are going to come right back, right now, in one minute break with the start of Overdrive for 20 minutes.
[03:58:21.648 --> 03:58:28.513]  We're going to go to Randy, Dan, Dale, Cody, and Roland at 888-201-2244 or 512-646-7076.
[03:58:28.513 --> 03:58:36.678]  Everybody that wants to hear this special Overdrive has to go to PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.tv to see the video.
[03:58:36.678 --> 03:58:38.960]  We'll be right back in one minute to all the other stations.
[03:58:38.960 --> 03:58:39.500]  God bless you.
[03:58:39.500 --> 03:58:40.721]  See you back live tomorrow, 11 3 p.m.
[03:58:40.721 --> 03:58:40.901]  Good job.
[03:58:43.343 --> 03:58:44.764]  You are listening to GCN.
[03:58:44.764 --> 03:58:51.809]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:51.809 --> 03:58:53.510]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[03:58:53.510 --> 03:58:58.253]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[03:58:58.253 --> 03:59:01.216]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[03:59:01.216 --> 03:59:04.258]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[03:59:04.258 --> 03:59:10.122]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[03:59:10.342 --> 03:59:13.565]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation that you need.
[03:59:13.565 --> 03:59:20.571]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[03:59:20.571 --> 03:59:23.834]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[03:59:23.834 --> 03:59:24.095]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[03:59:24.095 --> 03:59:25.396]  Or on the web, go to efoodsdirect.com.
[03:59:28.979 --> 03:59:30.459]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:59:30.459 --> 03:59:30.879]  Visit GCNlive.com.
[04:00:09.412 --> 04:00:13.036]  Well, we are starting hour number five.
[04:00:13.036 --> 04:00:16.260]  These are the times that try men's souls.
[04:00:16.260 --> 04:00:18.723]  Steve Quayle of stevequayle.com is our guest.
[04:00:18.723 --> 04:00:19.764]  We'll put it up on screen.
[04:00:19.764 --> 04:00:22.908]  If you want to get the spelling of his last name Quayle, you can visit it.
[04:00:24.650 --> 04:00:25.691]  I'll go ahead and punch that up.
[04:00:25.691 --> 04:00:28.172]  Q-U-A-Y-L-E dot com.
[04:00:28.172 --> 04:00:29.593]  Q-U-A-Y-L-E.
[04:00:29.593 --> 04:00:30.594]  That's how you spell it.
[04:00:30.594 --> 04:00:32.455]  Steve Quayle dot com.
[04:00:32.455 --> 04:00:36.517]  Our websites are Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[04:00:36.517 --> 04:00:39.179]  Jason Burmess has got breaking news dealing with a U.N.
[04:00:39.179 --> 04:00:40.059]  document.
[04:00:40.059 --> 04:00:41.520]  He'll be live tonight, 9 to midnight.
[04:00:41.520 --> 04:00:45.382]  When you get Steve on your show, 9 to midnight tonight with The Info Warrior.
[04:00:45.382 --> 04:00:47.784]  The website is TheInfoWarrior.com.
[04:00:47.784 --> 04:00:51.166]  And you can check that out at the subsidiary of Infowars.com.
[04:00:51.166 --> 04:00:52.827]  In the Info War!
[04:00:53.507 --> 04:01:04.435]  All right, I want to go to a bevy of phone calls for folks that we're holding on the other phone system with Genesis and then let Steve get out of here before we break this news with Jason Burmess.
[04:01:04.435 --> 04:01:07.077]  Steve Quayle, the chemtrail increasing.
[04:01:07.077 --> 04:01:19.527]  Now you have the government admitting they're terraforming the atmosphere for your own good, exactly as we said, barium salts, aluminum dioxide, saying, quote, these pollutants will help cool the earth, but the studies show it's actually heating them.
[04:01:19.527 --> 04:01:21.869]  You have a massive increase of chemtrails worldwide.
[04:01:22.369 --> 04:01:24.415]  They're coming out with everything.
[04:01:24.415 --> 04:01:29.309]  How do the chemtrails that you pioneered exposing back in the mid-nineties, how does that feed into all this?
[04:01:30.080 --> 04:01:57.731]  Well, there's multiple levels of this, but it's probably the largest genetic engineering experiment Alex has done on a worldwide basis that has ever been concocted, because not only are they just spraying the barium and aluminum salts and the variations, etc., for the original reason supposedly to deflect the solar radiation back in the upper atmosphere, the real thing was actually not only terraforming, but changing the genetic structure of the food we eat.
[04:01:58.371 --> 04:02:06.535]  Look, all the cows, all the sheep, everything without any form of livestock, any plants, everything, plants, and us too.
[04:02:06.535 --> 04:02:12.719]  And see, the thing is, and I say that, that we are what we eat, and this is what most people can't put together.
[04:02:12.719 --> 04:02:17.681]  They are absolutely testing various strains in various places.
[04:02:17.681 --> 04:02:23.204]  It's just like the old Dustin Hoffman movie, Outbreak, and by the way, that really happened, the opening scene with the African village.
[04:02:23.644 --> 04:02:24.784]  Ebola.
[04:02:24.784 --> 04:02:31.446]  I was on with George Norrie when I said, look, when the last time I did an Ebola story, and Ebola was my year, I said, the U.S.
[04:02:31.446 --> 04:02:37.568]  military or some of the intelligence agencies, you've got to get somebody down there because there are going to be guys flying in in helicopters and taking samples.
[04:02:37.568 --> 04:02:38.488]  Guess what?
[04:02:38.488 --> 04:02:44.470]  They didn't take my admonition seriously, and within hours after I said that, sure enough, the helicopters went in there.
[04:02:44.470 --> 04:02:46.290]  They were life-culturing Ebola.
[04:02:46.290 --> 04:02:47.350]  Now, here's the deal.
[04:02:47.350 --> 04:02:49.891]  What we're trying to get across is the fact that this is
[04:02:50.111 --> 04:02:50.511]  Yeah, yeah.
[04:03:05.228 --> 04:03:06.129]  Well, again, the thing is, is that
[04:03:28.450 --> 04:03:34.233]  Everything, everything, everything is lining up, so what is going to be broken on that UN document?
[04:03:34.233 --> 04:03:41.496]  Listen, what people have got to finally recognize is this, is that everything they've known is being taken away from them.
[04:03:41.496 --> 04:03:47.099]  It doesn't matter if it's a 401k, turning into a 201k, turning into a 101k, whatever it's going to.
[04:03:47.099 --> 04:03:54.202]  Their hope for their future, their children's future, their grandchildren's future, and at this point there are no political solutions.
[04:03:54.682 --> 04:04:02.726]  The only solution is, quite candidly, is that enough people can get warned and can get prepared to try and escape these devils.
[04:04:02.726 --> 04:04:06.567]  Because, like, one person just sent me an email calling it the Builder Burger Flu.
[04:04:06.567 --> 04:04:09.168]  Let's call it the Builder Burger Brew.
[04:04:09.168 --> 04:04:16.812]  Because, again, ladies and gentlemen, there's nothing that we're telling you that hasn't already been laid out, scripted out, and put into implementation.
[04:04:16.812 --> 04:04:19.973]  Remember the Vice President Biden's statement about the first six months?
[04:04:20.453 --> 04:04:24.698]  Of the new administration that President Obama was going to be challenged?
[04:04:24.698 --> 04:04:25.880]  Well, I got news for you, Alex.
[04:04:25.880 --> 04:04:27.181]  That's almost to the day, isn't it?
[04:04:28.362 --> 04:04:37.385]  Yeah, well they're acting like his first hundred days are like that he saved the earth and he was George Washington and Jesus and everybody wrapped into one.
[04:04:37.385 --> 04:04:39.926]  I mean it's just amazing worship of this guy.
[04:04:39.926 --> 04:04:48.909]  Were you surprised by the image I think you put up of Obama as Jesus with the crown of thorns on his head and stuff?
[04:04:48.909 --> 04:04:56.331]  Yes, and the city of New York has hung that up publicly with him as Jesus with that sickening fake smile.
[04:04:56.331 --> 04:04:57.232]  I mean this is
[04:04:57.992 --> 04:04:59.152]  Hey man, how's it going today?
[04:04:59.152 --> 04:05:00.453]  I'm just reporting from Canada here.
[04:05:15.386 --> 04:05:19.068]  This wine blue thing, you see it on the news and all this shit.
[04:05:19.068 --> 04:05:20.008]  They don't understand.
[04:05:40.171 --> 04:05:57.135]  What I think is, too, is we're not now, we don't know the exact time frame, but when the people at that Fort Myers Beach or whatever, that landing exercise, not one person questioned, you know, and I was praying on November, oh please let somebody go up and ask if this is a UN thing for the invasion of the United States.
[04:05:57.135 --> 04:05:59.736]  They may have questioned, they just won't show that in the newscast.
[04:05:59.736 --> 04:05:59.876]  Right.
[04:06:00.436 --> 04:06:10.944]  But, given the fact that now it's in your face, you see, I believe that obviously God gives a flashing neon sign, and this is a flashing neon sign, but I've got to get people to understand this.
[04:06:10.944 --> 04:06:19.550]  Very soon, the shortages, which have already appeared, started carrying ammo, reloading supplies, some food, everything is going to be dried up.
[04:06:20.010 --> 04:06:22.113]  And to the victors go the spoils.
[04:06:22.113 --> 04:06:29.100]  When you've got foreign mercenary troops, Alex, from the backside, that means the deepest levels of real world intelligence.
[04:06:29.100 --> 04:06:37.149]  These guys are laughing at how easy it's going to be to walk in and literally plunder the American citizens of everything they own.
[04:06:37.649 --> 04:06:53.651]  And that's what I'm telling you is so maddening to me because it's like everybody thinks, listen, if paratroopers start coming out of the sky machine gunning everybody below, they'll think it's a Rambo movie and they'll run out and try and get, you know, 50 bucks for a stand-in part.
[04:06:54.031 --> 04:06:55.573]  It's that controlled.
[04:06:55.573 --> 04:06:57.254]  Television has to go off.
[04:06:57.254 --> 04:06:59.896]  People have got to formulate immediate plans.
[04:06:59.896 --> 04:07:08.004]  And again, for those who are in the highest, highest target-rich environment, you guys have got to take immediate, immediate action.
[04:07:08.004 --> 04:07:14.029]  Look, when I gave that orange alert, people gave me so much stuff, you know, that it was just amazing.
[04:07:14.189 --> 04:07:14.970]  Okay, Steve, Steve.
[04:07:36.551 --> 04:07:42.458]  I want to take a few calls here, and for folks that want to call in specifically, didn't get a chance in the last hour, it's 888-201-2244, 888-201-2244 or 512.
[04:07:49.295 --> 04:07:52.617]  That's 512-646-1776.
[04:07:52.617 --> 04:07:57.539]  We'll take three or four more calls before Steve leaves us, but I wanted Jason Burmas to get to this.
[04:07:57.539 --> 04:07:59.580]  Let me show people that on TV.
[04:07:59.580 --> 04:08:09.765]  This is the huge checklist for influenza pandemic preparedness planning, and they admit that at a level four, they can start locking areas down, quarantining, getting the force inoculations ready.
[04:08:09.765 --> 04:08:11.446]  Level five, that all begins.
[04:08:11.446 --> 04:08:12.046]  We covered that with
[04:08:12.586 --> 04:08:31.055]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny yesterday, and Burmese has been reading over the Epidemic Alert and Response World Health Organization Department of Communicable Diseases Surveillance and Response Global Influenza Program of the United Nations in association with the CDC, CDS, CSR, and the GIP.
[04:08:31.055 --> 04:08:34.757]  Go ahead and go over those key areas and get Steve Quayle's take on that, Jason.
[04:08:35.217 --> 04:08:42.566]  Sure, I mean section 1.2 for instance is the command and control section where they ask who is really in charge.
[04:08:42.566 --> 04:08:45.949]  I gotta stop you by the way for weird listeners that send me emails saying don't interrupt.
[04:08:45.949 --> 04:08:47.751]  We interrupt here for key breaking news.
[04:08:47.751 --> 04:08:49.133]  You guys are just neurotic out there.
[04:08:49.994 --> 04:08:51.155]  This is huge breaking news.
[04:08:51.155 --> 04:08:52.155]  Get it up on screen.
[04:08:52.155 --> 04:08:54.657]  I want to play a clip of this right now.
[04:08:54.657 --> 04:08:57.218]  Swine alert level up to the second highest.
[04:08:57.218 --> 04:08:58.959]  It goes from 1 to 6.
[04:08:58.959 --> 04:09:00.920]  They were at 4, saying they'd go to 5.
[04:09:00.920 --> 04:09:05.823]  5 can be forced inoculations, roundups, arrests, military checkpoints.
[04:09:05.823 --> 04:09:08.444]  That's in AP Reuters official announcements.
[04:09:08.784 --> 04:09:10.344]  Level 6 is open.
[04:09:10.344 --> 04:09:11.965]  Total martial law.
[04:09:11.965 --> 04:09:13.865]  You're basically shot if you leave your house.
[04:09:13.865 --> 04:09:15.565]  Suspension of all freedoms.
[04:09:15.565 --> 04:09:19.466]  And they're doing this in the name of a flu that's only killed a few people.
[04:09:19.466 --> 04:09:21.447]  They're now saying 9 people in Mexico.
[04:09:21.447 --> 04:09:23.007]  The others died of other stuff.
[04:09:23.007 --> 04:09:24.127]  Just unbelievable.
[04:09:24.127 --> 04:09:26.308]  Breaking news.
[04:09:26.308 --> 04:09:27.588]  It's a phase 5 alert.
[04:09:27.588 --> 04:09:30.288]  It's a strong signal that a pandemic is imminent.
[04:09:30.288 --> 04:09:35.049]  It is called when there is a human-to-human spread of the virus in at least two countries in one region.
[04:09:35.049 --> 04:09:37.230]  So far, 150 people are thought to have died from the H1N1.
[04:09:38.610 --> 04:09:40.371]  Mexico's saying that's not true.
[04:09:40.371 --> 04:09:42.412]  All but one deaths have been in Mexico.
[04:09:42.412 --> 04:09:46.113]  A Mexican toddler visiting the United States was the first death in America.
[04:09:46.113 --> 04:09:51.195]  The virus has spread to nine countries and may have infected more than 2,500 people.
[04:09:51.195 --> 04:09:54.316]  Sources say the level will be raised from four to five.
[04:09:54.316 --> 04:09:56.297]  Print that article for me ASAP.
[04:09:56.297 --> 04:10:00.579]  Okay, I want to get Steve Quill's take on this, then Burma's, then you can get into the UN saying what they're going to do.
[04:10:00.579 --> 04:10:01.139]  Go ahead, Steve.
[04:10:01.619 --> 04:10:04.802]  Well, right now, as we're on the air, this is breaking news.
[04:10:04.802 --> 04:10:11.328]  A lot of the people that monitor the different traffics, these are from military intelligence, former intelligence guys, I'm getting an email.
[04:10:11.328 --> 04:10:20.677]  Steve, warn everybody, I'm picking up activity on the Army National Guard frequencies, also hearing helicopters being put on standby, also unusual Red Cross activity on BHF Loban.
[04:10:20.677 --> 04:10:23.059]  I will advise you as I sort this out.
[04:10:23.519 --> 04:10:25.921]  Let me share this with you, Alex.
[04:10:25.921 --> 04:10:27.542]  100% no melodrama.
[04:10:27.542 --> 04:10:29.364]  This guy just calls it like he sees it.
[04:10:29.364 --> 04:10:36.209]  So the point being is that with Jason's documentation, it is already being implemented.
[04:10:36.209 --> 04:10:39.892]  I don't know if that means we have two days or two weeks.
[04:10:39.892 --> 04:10:41.493]  But again, I want to make this clear.
[04:10:41.693 --> 04:10:46.097]  Anybody who is going to leave their current location had better consider doing it.
[04:10:46.097 --> 04:10:48.919]  They've got nothing but an extended vacation if we're wrong.
[04:10:48.919 --> 04:10:51.141]  They won't be able to get to where they're going if we're right.
[04:10:51.141 --> 04:10:56.725]  People in New York, you need to probably... Because, because if they go, a level 5 can lock down all the cities.
[04:10:56.725 --> 04:10:58.927]  A level 6 just means it's guaranteed.
[04:10:58.927 --> 04:11:00.548]  Absolutely, that's what I'm trying to say.
[04:11:00.548 --> 04:11:06.993]  And I gotta tell ya, I'm surrounded by people that will all think about leaving when I see it in the roadblocks and say, you'll be dead.
[04:11:08.129 --> 04:11:12.212]  I'm serious Alex, this is so in your face.
[04:11:12.212 --> 04:11:13.532]  These people do not care.
[04:11:13.532 --> 04:11:22.718]  Bilderberger flu, death brew, all the antecedents that are the precedents and everything that has followed that have gone on around the world.
[04:11:22.718 --> 04:11:26.480]  Hey Steve, did you call Coast to Coast to get us on the other day or did they call you?
[04:11:26.480 --> 04:11:27.101]  They called us.
[04:11:27.441 --> 04:11:29.625]  Yeah, they called me.
[04:11:29.625 --> 04:11:38.038]  Maybe we should call them and say that we need to have an update tonight in the first hour, because going to this level 5 is a big, big deal.
[04:11:38.038 --> 04:11:41.183]  George is a smart guy, but I'm not sure they're going to understand the full import of this.
[04:11:42.116 --> 04:11:43.276]  Well, here's the deal, Alex.
[04:11:43.276 --> 04:11:47.177]  I'll talk to Lisa and tell her that, you know, we're both available to do that.
[04:11:47.177 --> 04:11:51.739]  But again, ladies and gentlemen, this is no dry run.
[04:11:51.739 --> 04:11:53.159]  You would not have the documents.
[04:11:53.159 --> 04:11:54.459]  What's happened, okay?
[04:11:54.459 --> 04:11:56.180]  A lot of stuff has existed in the background.
[04:11:56.180 --> 04:11:57.760]  It's not being brought to the foreground.
[04:11:57.760 --> 04:11:59.721]  Because you're going to have military commanders, U.S.
[04:11:59.721 --> 04:12:03.602]  military commanders, rightly so challenging a lot of these orders, okay?
[04:12:04.062 --> 04:12:23.901]  And I can tell you this, a four-star general from my best friend just left for another part of the world, and he said to my friend, he said, you tell all the people you know, keep your head down, because it's coming apart, it seems, and this is active duty, this is not Bravo Sierra, some guy on the news worried about, you know, his pension.
[04:12:24.481 --> 04:12:30.788]  There are real people who are ready to basically defend their Constitution, take up the oath, and they know what's happening.
[04:12:30.788 --> 04:12:35.553]  And ladies and gentlemen, whether you know it or not, there is no longer a United States as you know it.
[04:12:35.553 --> 04:12:37.816]  Let me state this calmly, okay?
[04:12:37.816 --> 04:12:40.359]  Regardless, it looks like this flu is a hoax.
[04:12:40.939 --> 04:12:41.439]  Absolutely.
[04:13:01.534 --> 04:13:03.377]  Now, but that doesn't matter.
[04:13:03.377 --> 04:13:12.632]  The way over response, the craziness, the troops on standby, all the drills and flu drills and martial law drills and mass grave preparations we confirmed.
[04:13:13.553 --> 04:13:22.615]  Before this, that's why things are so, and that's why my gut has been taking this since last Friday, and then Saturday I said, this, something's going on.
[04:13:22.615 --> 04:13:39.480]  I said, I think this is a hoax flu-wise, but the response is real, the vaccine is real, you know, my spirit, you know, my gut, my instincts tells me something's very serious here, and we're going to go to Jason Bermes in a moment with this other breaking news of what this means, what the United Nations is saying, but let's go to a few calls
[04:13:40.180 --> 04:13:42.481]  Uh, Tommy dropped, I thought Tommy disagreed.
[04:13:42.481 --> 04:13:44.361]  I go to people that disagree first.
[04:13:44.361 --> 04:13:52.244]  Okay, let's go to, uh... And each caller's got about 30 seconds, folks, because I gotta get out of here, so does Burma, so does Steve Quayle.
[04:13:52.244 --> 04:13:54.105]  Uh, Mark in Oregon, you're on the air, go ahead.
[04:13:54.833 --> 04:13:56.816]  Yeah, how do Alex and Steve?
[04:13:56.816 --> 04:13:57.436]  God bless you.
[04:13:57.436 --> 04:13:58.858]  Thank you.
[04:13:58.858 --> 04:13:59.879]  Yes, sir.
[04:13:59.879 --> 04:14:08.190]  Steve, I really want to ask you, I know it's hard to do because things are in such a state of flux at the moment and they're actually evolving.
[04:14:08.190 --> 04:14:10.753]  It may not be possible for you to answer this this day, but
[04:14:11.460 --> 04:14:19.404]  What do you see occurring here with what you know at this point in time over the next two to three weeks in this country that's going to affect every person in this country?
[04:14:19.404 --> 04:14:21.586]  And I'll take my hands off the air shortly.
[04:14:21.586 --> 04:14:23.427]  I certainly appreciate everything you guys have said.
[04:14:23.427 --> 04:14:23.947]  Thank you.
[04:14:23.947 --> 04:14:25.087]  Thank you, Mark in Oregon.
[04:14:25.087 --> 04:14:26.188]  Go ahead, Steve Quayle.
[04:14:26.188 --> 04:14:28.089]  Well, Alex, you just gave the answer to that ahead of time.
[04:14:28.089 --> 04:14:35.693]  I said, I don't know if we've got two days or two weeks, but we go to Level 5, and God forbid we go to Level 6, they will implement martial law.
[04:14:35.693 --> 04:14:40.276]  Now, the question should be more, will they implement it first in the states that have already declared?
[04:14:40.976 --> 04:14:41.517]  I don't know.
[04:14:50.987 --> 04:14:53.909]  The question is, will they then physically enforce it?
[04:14:53.909 --> 04:14:58.171]  But they have declared we're under the martial law civil emergency.
[04:14:58.171 --> 04:15:02.314]  If you read the corresponding executive orders, as you know, Steve... Right, I agree with that.
[04:15:02.314 --> 04:15:03.855]  But here's what I'm saying.
[04:15:03.855 --> 04:15:05.376]  Give me an implement.
[04:15:05.376 --> 04:15:10.459]  If I hear that the control has gone up, and others, by the way, it's not just a thing with me, okay?
[04:15:10.459 --> 04:15:12.480]  There are plenty of people that can blow the whistle.
[04:15:12.480 --> 04:15:17.123]  If we hear that the control has gone up and they go operational, for people to understand this,
[04:15:17.583 --> 04:15:26.972]  The airborne command structure that will initiate the implementation, sending troops in, and the assassination teams against those who are designated targets.
[04:15:26.972 --> 04:15:32.977]  That will go up when that individual goes up and says, you know, gives his code and his emergency action message.
[04:15:33.277 --> 04:15:43.400]  And demands total, total obedience, and he'll say it probably three to seven times where the protocol is, and changes it from one word, this is not an exercise, this is go, that's when the fur flies.
[04:15:43.400 --> 04:15:52.903]  And Alex, we were there, this is what I tried to get across to everybody, I don't think people understood this on Coast to Coast, we were there on Saturday when you were having your emergency broadcasting.
[04:15:53.820 --> 04:15:58.548]  Yeah, now we know they have a list of American patriots, gun owners, and people of influence.
[04:15:58.548 --> 04:16:07.241]  That was declassified in the church hearings in the seventies, and we know, and now publicly confirmed, it was already documented, but people didn't want to believe it, that the main threat
[04:16:08.240 --> 04:16:15.043]  To the terrorists that run the government, Homeland Security, is the American people, gun owners, Christians, business owners, veterans.
[04:16:15.043 --> 04:16:19.866]  And so, this whole military apparatus of NORTHCOM is for us.
[04:16:19.866 --> 04:16:22.987]  Because when they take America down, they gotta go after us.
[04:16:22.987 --> 04:16:27.249]  You don't think they're not gonna use the martial law to get it in place and get everybody acclimated and then start?
[04:16:27.249 --> 04:16:30.451]  You think they're gonna slam it down, day one?
[04:16:31.101 --> 04:16:36.064]  I think they're going to slam it down day one from the time the Aero Command Directive is given.
[04:16:36.064 --> 04:16:38.004]  I want people to understand this.
[04:16:38.004 --> 04:16:49.430]  When I have a Lieutenant Colonel that works for that organization in my office who's a Christian and scared to death out of what is being planned, and I asked him, I won't say his name, I said, how many?
[04:16:49.430 --> 04:16:50.391]  He says 200 million.
[04:16:50.391 --> 04:16:52.712]  Well, you know what that question was all about, Alex?
[04:16:52.712 --> 04:16:54.873]  How many people are they prepared to take out?
[04:16:55.831 --> 04:17:05.493]  Well, we know they killed half of Ukraine and 35% of Cambodia, and then they write books about it, bragging.
[04:17:05.493 --> 04:17:11.414]  I want to go back to calls in a moment, but Burmese, I apologize for interrupting you with the Level 5 alert.
[04:17:11.414 --> 04:17:16.995]  I apologize to listeners that don't like that I interrupted with the Level 5 alert, but people need to know that.
[04:17:16.995 --> 04:17:20.676]  You go ahead and read from the start the document name and what you found.
[04:17:20.676 --> 04:17:20.816]  Sure.
[04:17:22.256 --> 04:17:28.260]  The WHO or World Health Organization Checklist for Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Planning.
[04:17:28.260 --> 04:17:29.981]  It's a 39-page document.
[04:17:29.981 --> 04:17:33.784]  But some of the highlights here, Alex, are in the Command and Control section.
[04:17:33.784 --> 04:17:35.385]  They ask, oh, who's in charge?
[04:17:35.385 --> 04:17:39.988]  Is it the Prime Minister or the President, the Ministry of Health, other departments, regional officers?
[04:17:39.988 --> 04:17:40.728]  We just don't know.
[04:17:40.728 --> 04:17:52.056]  And then they tell you who's in charge right over here in section 1.4.2 to ensure that mechanisms exist for the information sharing between national authorities, WHO and other United Nations agencies.
[04:17:52.396 --> 04:18:09.770]  No, it's in Reuters and AP, the Secretary General saying the US, Canada, Europe, Mexico are all following their directive.
[04:18:09.770 --> 04:18:15.415]  The global government is activated and he said this is great for global governance, this is a great test for everybody to go under our control.
[04:18:15.595 --> 04:18:25.241]  Yeah, and then in Section 1.5.1, Legal and Ethical Issues, they say, During a pandemic, it may be necessary to overrule existing legislation or individual human rights.
[04:18:25.241 --> 04:18:27.042]  That's right, folks, you have no rights.
[04:18:27.042 --> 04:18:29.123]  Examples are the enforcement of quarantine.
[04:18:29.123 --> 04:18:32.065]  That means, you know, they can take you, put you in the camp, keep you there.
[04:18:32.065 --> 04:18:34.627]  Overruling individual freedom of movement.
[04:18:34.627 --> 04:18:36.908]  Use of privately owned buildings for hospitals.
[04:18:37.368 --> 04:18:38.889]  Uh, off-license use of drugs.
[04:18:38.889 --> 04:18:42.211]  In other words, the drugs don't actually have to be good for you, have to be verified.
[04:18:42.211 --> 04:18:44.672]  They can be total poison and they can't get in trouble for it.
[04:18:44.672 --> 04:18:46.333]  Uh, compulsory vaccination.
[04:18:46.333 --> 04:18:51.176]  You must take the vaccination or implementation of emergency shifts in essential services.
[04:18:51.176 --> 04:18:51.817]  And that's Level 5!
[04:18:52.897 --> 04:18:53.977]  Yes, I believe so.
[04:18:53.977 --> 04:18:55.778]  That's level 5, I've read their checklist.
[04:18:55.778 --> 04:18:56.338]  You know what?
[04:18:56.338 --> 04:19:00.159]  We've taken a lot of Steve Quayle, SteveQuayle.com's time, but you know what?
[04:19:00.159 --> 04:19:01.659]  You're going to be live tonight, 9 to midnight.
[04:19:01.659 --> 04:19:02.740]  That's why I got you down here.
[04:19:02.740 --> 04:19:03.100]  Yes.
[04:19:03.100 --> 04:19:06.321]  It's a blessing, so we have two time slots to be live.
[04:19:06.321 --> 04:19:08.601]  Steve, I know you have your family and things to do.
[04:19:08.601 --> 04:19:15.423]  Should we get a 30-minute report from you at, say, 9.20 to the end of the hour?
[04:19:15.423 --> 04:19:18.284]  Tonight, Central, I guess you're Mountain.
[04:19:18.284 --> 04:19:21.905]  Could we have you on in case there's been any new developments, which it looks like there will be?
[04:19:22.145 --> 04:19:26.627]  Yes, and Alex, I'm doing my show today from 5 to 6, okay?
[04:19:26.627 --> 04:19:30.129]  SteveQuail.com, you can click on live, it's internet only.
[04:19:30.129 --> 04:19:43.815]  And the thing is, is that I will be posting, if things continue to speed up, as I sense they will, just so you know, I don't think I will, here's what I'm trying to say, I will be posting my red screen, and this is
[04:19:44.475 --> 04:19:45.056]  This is it.
[04:19:45.056 --> 04:19:55.586]  Now, people can pay attention to it or not, but, you know, their blood is off my hands, and those of you who I've been able to warn and you've prepared your families, I just want you to know, God bless you.
[04:19:55.586 --> 04:20:05.135]  I thank you for taking an active role in your future and not letting some group of international bureaucrats rule your destiny and destroy your future.
[04:20:05.135 --> 04:20:08.838]  Well, about ten days ago, or last Monday, you launched the
[04:20:09.699 --> 04:20:13.142]  The orange alert saying get ready for the next two weeks for them to drop the hammer.
[04:20:13.142 --> 04:20:14.503]  Never done that before.
[04:20:14.503 --> 04:20:15.964]  Now it's just happened again.
[04:20:15.964 --> 04:20:19.246]  And you're saying you're going to DEFCON 5.
[04:20:19.246 --> 04:20:20.807]  I mean, you're going to put out a red alert.
[04:20:20.807 --> 04:20:21.708]  My red alert.
[04:20:22.620 --> 04:20:25.281]  I mean, is that saying they're guaranteed to come after everybody?
[04:20:25.281 --> 04:20:26.381]  Uh, let me say this.
[04:20:26.381 --> 04:20:32.503]  If the message is given and they're going up, now, can somebody say, well, how can you make sure the internet stays up?
[04:20:32.503 --> 04:20:37.564]  I can't, but I pray that the people that will have the time to see the red alert will take it seriously.
[04:20:37.564 --> 04:20:43.226]  I'm not saying, Alex, at this point, I'm saying specifically, I need one piece of information.
[04:20:43.226 --> 04:20:47.347]  I have never done that in my entire life, nor would I get one shot at it, okay?
[04:20:47.967 --> 04:20:59.895]  But if it is implementation of martial law and the command directive is given by the aerial control mechanism, I'll leave it vague, then the point is that we're there and...
[04:21:18.588 --> 04:21:27.503]  The safety is off, the gun is to our head, and with these globalist history, and them certainly hyping something that shouldn't be being hyped, we've got to be ready.
[04:21:28.376 --> 04:21:37.060]  Well, and literally, Alex, in your case too, and I want to encourage everybody out there that is a believer that knows how to intercessory pray.
[04:21:37.060 --> 04:21:39.762]  You had better pray, because you pray for Alex Jones.
[04:21:39.762 --> 04:21:40.982]  Please, pray for me.
[04:21:40.982 --> 04:21:41.583]  Pray for Hawk.
[04:21:41.583 --> 04:21:42.403]  Pray for Jason.
[04:21:42.403 --> 04:21:51.348]  Pray for the people that are absolutely trying to save as many lives, wake as many people up, and make a difference.
[04:21:51.348 --> 04:21:57.671]  Because again, ladies and gentlemen, even though these people can plan and they're ready to dispose of all of us by heartbeat,
[04:21:58.271 --> 04:21:59.912]  Dispatch us is their term.
[04:21:59.912 --> 04:22:04.834]  The point is there is a God in heaven who can act on behalf of intercessory prayer.
[04:22:04.834 --> 04:22:06.795]  It's been proven time and time again.
[04:22:06.795 --> 04:22:10.056]  And by the way, Alex, we are at the darkest hour.
[04:22:10.056 --> 04:22:13.138]  We are literally to the point where we're at a tipping point.
[04:22:13.138 --> 04:22:15.359]  And that's all I can say.
[04:22:15.879 --> 04:22:16.560]  No, I agree with you.
[04:22:16.560 --> 04:22:18.142]  We've got time to take a few more calls.
[04:22:18.142 --> 04:22:20.585]  Burmess will be covering this 9 to midnight tonight.
[04:22:20.585 --> 04:22:21.866]  And you will be on then.
[04:22:21.866 --> 04:22:28.815]  Let's just have you write at 10 minutes in, for about 30-40 minutes, to give us your latest reports on what's going on with Jason Burmess tonight.
[04:22:28.815 --> 04:22:32.299]  We will call your main number and get you on, and I'll probably call in too.
[04:22:32.299 --> 04:22:35.203]  I'm probably going to be up here, so I might even be sitting in with you, Jason.
[04:22:35.763 --> 04:22:38.844]  Uh, for those who don't know, swine alert level up to second highest.
[04:22:38.844 --> 04:22:40.724]  It's gone from level four to level five.
[04:22:40.724 --> 04:22:41.565]  That's Sky News.
[04:22:41.565 --> 04:22:44.645]  We'll make sure that's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[04:22:44.645 --> 04:22:48.046]  If it isn't already up, ask Nemo and Paul to get that up immediately.
[04:22:48.046 --> 04:22:49.887]  This is just off the charts.
[04:22:49.887 --> 04:22:53.748]  Uh, for a flu that's nothing, at least, unless they're lying about what it's doing.
[04:22:53.748 --> 04:22:54.388]  This is incredible.
[04:22:55.919 --> 04:22:57.439]  It's not the threat, Alex.
[04:22:57.439 --> 04:23:07.465]  It's the solution to the threat, and the solution is what's getting the dominant amount of air coverage, and not one thinking individual saying, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute on national media.
[04:23:07.465 --> 04:23:09.326]  Look, you guys, you're blowing this out of proportion.
[04:23:09.326 --> 04:23:12.028]  How many people die every year of pneumonia or whatever?
[04:23:12.028 --> 04:23:20.512]  It's absolutely the most creative, let's say, use of fear and terror by the mainstream media that I've ever seen in my life.
[04:23:20.512 --> 04:23:21.073]  Yeah, it is.
[04:23:21.073 --> 04:23:21.693]  It's incredible.
[04:23:23.394 --> 04:23:25.675]  Even though it looks like a total hoax, I'm still upset.
[04:23:25.675 --> 04:23:27.716]  And it's because of what they're doing.
[04:23:27.716 --> 04:23:29.797]  And it's because it's how obvious it is.
[04:23:29.797 --> 04:23:32.859]  And if we get the word out what they're doing, they may back off.
[04:23:32.859 --> 04:23:34.620]  We've done this before.
[04:23:34.620 --> 04:23:36.160]  And I told you we're the main threat.
[04:23:36.160 --> 04:23:36.881]  We have power.
[04:23:36.881 --> 04:23:38.982]  That's why those of you out there are so important.
[04:23:38.982 --> 04:23:41.763]  That's why we're the number one threat in the Secret Homeland Security documents.
[04:23:41.763 --> 04:23:42.764]  They know that we know.
[04:23:43.664 --> 04:23:44.344]  What they're doing.
[04:23:44.344 --> 04:23:47.025]  They're aware that we understand their program.
[04:23:47.025 --> 04:23:49.545]  And that's why they hate it that our numbers are growing.
[04:23:49.545 --> 04:23:51.966]  And I've said they're going to turn the chessboard over.
[04:23:51.966 --> 04:23:54.267]  That's why they're going to go ahead and just move right at us.
[04:23:54.267 --> 04:23:56.987]  That's what I've been seeing in the cards.
[04:23:56.987 --> 04:23:58.148]  Oh man.
[04:23:58.148 --> 04:23:59.168]  Forrest in Texas.
[04:23:59.168 --> 04:24:01.008]  You're on the air, Forrest.
[04:24:01.008 --> 04:24:01.768]  Yes, sir.
[04:24:01.768 --> 04:24:05.209]  I have a question for Steve and a quick question for you, Alex.
[04:24:05.209 --> 04:24:06.029]  Okay, go ahead.
[04:24:06.029 --> 04:24:09.450]  Okay, this is a question for Steve.
[04:24:09.450 --> 04:24:12.191]  Do you believe there could be any type of way that the
[04:24:13.092 --> 04:24:13.232]  No.
[04:24:13.232 --> 04:24:14.013]  Categorically, no.
[04:24:28.343 --> 04:24:37.588]  Do you think it would be possible if we could all have maybe like half of the show or a couple like an hour just like dedicated to praying for this nation?
[04:24:37.588 --> 04:24:46.113]  Like maybe have like Len Horowitz back on, have Jim and Tex Maher and George Humphreys and we just like send out positive, loving energy to, you know, to help.
[04:24:48.615 --> 04:24:49.956]  I believe in love.
[04:24:49.956 --> 04:24:51.818]  Well, Alex, Alex, can I say this?
[04:24:51.818 --> 04:24:52.880]  Well, we believe in love.
[04:24:52.880 --> 04:24:53.500]  They don't.
[04:24:53.500 --> 04:24:58.326]  And right now, as Mao is their god, all true power comes out the barrel of a gun.
[04:24:58.326 --> 04:24:59.147]  Let me share this.
[04:24:59.147 --> 04:25:03.332]  I believe in imprecatory prayer to the living God.
[04:25:03.332 --> 04:25:04.794]  I think we're in the same state.
[04:25:05.254 --> 04:25:16.542]  As the gallows are prepared, and Haman is licking his chops, and everybody needs to take on a Queen Esther role to go in before the King, who is the God of the Universe, saying all that.
[04:25:16.542 --> 04:25:21.885]  I'm telling everybody, that's not going to get the job done, because everyone loses track of something.
[04:25:21.885 --> 04:25:31.091]  This is the nation that has absolutely said, basically, with all of its symbols of the last hundred days, move over Jesus, there's a new Savior in town.
[04:25:31.091 --> 04:25:32.152]  The new Savior cannot
[04:25:32.392 --> 04:25:41.915]  Yeah, I mean, look at how he goes to speak at churches and they pull down statues of Jesus, his name, then they show him as Jesus.
[04:25:41.915 --> 04:25:42.915]  It is total blasphemy.
[04:25:42.915 --> 04:25:44.916]  And here is the United Nations document.
[04:25:44.916 --> 04:25:45.896]  Make sure they do an article on this.
[04:25:45.896 --> 04:25:50.338]  I mean, I know it's in there for compulsory injections in the executive orders, but here's the U.N.
[04:25:50.338 --> 04:25:52.598]  saying they control our government.
[04:25:52.598 --> 04:25:57.660]  Section 15.1, compulsory vaccination or implementation of emergency shifts.
[04:25:58.300 --> 04:25:59.602]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[04:25:59.602 --> 04:26:01.824]  So it is all right there.
[04:26:01.824 --> 04:26:02.685]  So much to cover.
[04:26:02.685 --> 04:26:04.167]  Thank you so much, caller.
[04:26:04.167 --> 04:26:07.411]  Yeah, trust in God, but, you know, tie up your camel.
[04:26:07.411 --> 04:26:09.774]  A ghost dance isn't going to cut it.
[04:26:09.774 --> 04:26:12.497]  Yeah, who raises pandemic alert level?
[04:26:12.497 --> 04:26:14.940]  Let me read that next part of the headline, please.
[04:26:14.940 --> 04:26:17.243]  And it says swine flu incident.
[04:26:18.124 --> 04:26:21.087]  At 16 in Canada.
[04:26:21.087 --> 04:26:24.270]  And I'm going to give each caller 30 seconds and we've got to go.
[04:26:24.270 --> 04:26:27.473]  Let's go ahead and take some more calls here.
[04:26:27.473 --> 04:26:29.254]  Excuse my call screen.
[04:26:29.254 --> 04:26:31.356]  Calls.
[04:26:31.356 --> 04:26:32.858]  Computer screen pops up.
[04:26:32.858 --> 04:26:34.099]  Graham in Washington.
[04:26:34.099 --> 04:26:34.839]  You're on the air.
[04:26:34.839 --> 04:26:35.220]  Go ahead.
[04:26:36.451 --> 04:26:38.073]  Hi Alex, thank you for taking my call.
[04:26:38.073 --> 04:26:44.600]  I have an important story that I saw yesterday out of KTLA down in Southern California, KTLA.com.
[04:26:44.600 --> 04:26:49.545]  They have a video entitled, Border Agents, Eye Travelers for Signs of Flu.
[04:26:49.545 --> 04:26:56.913]  Marie Mortera reports and it says basically that the CDC has ordered the border agents to eye travelers for obvious signs of flu.
[04:26:57.413 --> 04:27:00.455]  I've been asked by the CDC to look for travelers with obvious blue signs.
[04:27:24.039 --> 04:27:30.542]  Now those people might be taken to a CDC quarantine area or to a local health official for an evaluation.
[04:27:30.542 --> 04:27:33.384]  For some, they say any extra check is a welcome for cops.
[04:27:34.538 --> 04:27:38.543]  Yeah, that's a martial law when they say we're gonna make you go to a facility.
[04:27:38.543 --> 04:27:40.104]  That's already level 5 or 6.
[04:27:40.104 --> 04:27:44.529]  I was saying yesterday, when I saw those articles, we're already at level 5.
[04:27:44.529 --> 04:27:47.352]  So if they're saying we're at 5, Steve, that means we're at 6.
[04:27:47.352 --> 04:27:50.916]  Like yesterday they said we were 4, but we really said we were 5.
[04:27:50.916 --> 04:27:52.438]  Now they're saying we're 5.
[04:27:52.438 --> 04:27:54.140]  Have they already gone to 6, Steve Quayle?
[04:27:54.460 --> 04:27:57.923]  Yes they have, because Time Magazine's already written an article about it!
[04:27:57.923 --> 04:27:58.524]  You know?
[04:27:58.524 --> 04:28:02.788]  We are going to face mandatory forced vaccinations.
[04:28:02.788 --> 04:28:07.953]  I believe Alex is going to be fined 250 grand and five years in jail for refusing it.
[04:28:07.953 --> 04:28:12.157]  Well, you know, try and get 250 grand out of some guy that is just totally wiped out.
[04:28:12.157 --> 04:28:15.761]  But you see, the law has got to be in place so that these
[04:28:16.241 --> 04:28:25.311]  Monsters have justification in their own mind for carrying out the destruction of their fellow countrymen.
[04:28:25.311 --> 04:28:26.612]  I'll tell you what's incredible.
[04:28:26.612 --> 04:28:36.982]  Other Patriot talk shows I tune into are making fun of us even covering this, even on this network, and are busy talking about issues of little or no significance.
[04:28:38.364 --> 04:28:45.834]  Well, then it's obvious where their allegiance lies, it's obvious where their loyalties lie, and it's obvious, probably, that who's paying them.
[04:28:45.834 --> 04:28:48.037]  Look, I make no bones about it.
[04:28:48.037 --> 04:28:50.020]  You cannot be where we're at.
[04:28:50.020 --> 04:28:53.805]  And anybody, listen, I'm saying this, and I'll say this to Alex, but don't give Alex heat.
[04:28:53.805 --> 04:28:54.666]  Give me the heat for this.
[04:28:55.046 --> 04:29:04.191]  But anybody that's making fun of us when we have been so right, even to the urgent alert, everything that we've both done has brought everyone to this point.
[04:29:04.191 --> 04:29:08.713]  They are on the other side, and I don't give a darn who thinks that.
[04:29:08.713 --> 04:29:17.498]  If anybody is saying what we're saying to warn people to save their lives, then they are the enemy, and they are as much an enemy as the people that are coming in with the blue berets to blow us all away.
[04:29:18.510 --> 04:29:41.073]  Well what they do is, and I don't even think some of them are agents and it's other networks and people, is that they say that I'm saying it's a pandemic when from day one when I went on the air Saturday and Friday, but Saturday I should know, I think this is hype, but the way they're acting and the police state they're setting up and all the preparation and pre-hype I saw go into this tells me that they're getting ready for a big move like 9-11.
[04:29:42.114 --> 04:29:44.176]  Absolutely.
[04:29:44.176 --> 04:29:48.800]  And so all I'm saying is there's a lot of crazy crap going on and they stand to gain.
[04:29:48.800 --> 04:29:51.343]  We're not the ones that are putting this alert out.
[04:29:51.343 --> 04:29:52.164]  It's the government.
[04:29:52.164 --> 04:30:01.773]  They're the ones saying they're getting ready for forced inoculations and in North Carolina and California and Texas saying they're going to have checkpoints and grab you off the street.
[04:30:01.773 --> 04:30:04.876]  I mean, you know, hell, all I'm doing is reporting what's going on.
[04:30:05.396 --> 04:30:12.878]  And when you even use the sources they all pay attention to to validate their positions, then, you know, look, here's the thing.
[04:30:12.878 --> 04:30:14.419]  People don't understand, Alex.
[04:30:14.419 --> 04:30:20.800]  There is an entire division in Northcom that does nothing but try and neutralize what you and I say.
[04:30:20.800 --> 04:30:23.641]  It's not making me or you important.
[04:30:23.641 --> 04:30:32.884]  All I'm saying is this, is that to keep the maximum amount of sheep asleep before they get slaughtered, there is absolute cyberwarfare going on.
[04:30:32.944 --> 04:30:33.124]  It's
[04:30:51.468 --> 04:30:52.429]  We're good to go.
[04:31:07.984 --> 04:31:09.204]  Well, that's a distraction.
[04:31:09.204 --> 04:31:10.345]  Everything we say comes true.
[04:31:10.345 --> 04:31:11.845]  Everything we've said's been right.
[04:31:11.845 --> 04:31:15.087]  And of course it takes funds to pay all these people and do all this.
[04:31:15.087 --> 04:31:18.228]  We're totally obsessed with fighting the New World Order.
[04:31:18.228 --> 04:31:19.429]  We need more donations.
[04:31:19.429 --> 04:31:22.931]  People need to buy more of our books and videos and support us.
[04:31:22.931 --> 04:31:23.971]  But not even that.
[04:31:23.971 --> 04:31:31.755]  Look, I make the films like Truth Rising, Endgame, Jason Makes Fabled Enemies, Obama, Deception, and Day One.
[04:31:32.737 --> 04:31:36.539]  I put it free on the internet, and believe me, that cuts into our sales.
[04:31:36.539 --> 04:31:37.440]  But I don't care!
[04:31:37.440 --> 04:31:39.021]  I have no future.
[04:31:39.021 --> 04:31:40.441]  My children have no future.
[04:31:40.441 --> 04:31:41.702]  Do I want money?
[04:31:41.702 --> 04:31:42.282]  Absolutely.
[04:31:42.282 --> 04:31:48.586]  I wish I had the money to get a little farm so I could have ISDN lines so I don't have to, when all this goes to hell, if it does, I just won't be here.
[04:31:48.586 --> 04:31:52.268]  I'm going to get my kids and I'm going to go to the family farm, and there's no way to do the show there.
[04:31:52.768 --> 04:31:54.269]  But I'm trying to think of ways.
[04:31:54.269 --> 04:31:56.511]  We need more money to be able to do this properly.
[04:31:56.511 --> 04:32:02.215]  But when the jig's up, the balloon goes up, ISDN lines and crap will be down anyway.
[04:32:02.215 --> 04:32:06.759]  So, you know, I mean, the point is, this is so real, people need to understand that.
[04:32:06.759 --> 04:32:16.266]  Steve Quayle, we'll see you tonight during the first hour of the show with Jason Bermas on the Infowarrior to recap all the latest developments 9 to midnight central tonight.
[04:32:16.266 --> 04:32:18.447]  And we'll see you on your show coming up in a few hours.
[04:32:18.447 --> 04:32:20.349]  Steve Quayle, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[04:32:20.469 --> 04:32:21.050]  Thanks, Alex.
[04:32:21.050 --> 04:32:21.490]  God bless.
[04:32:21.490 --> 04:32:21.770]  Bye-bye.
[04:32:37.495 --> 04:32:38.536]  It's no big deal.
[04:32:38.536 --> 04:32:43.540]  You know, it's like somebody farts in a church and everybody acts like they're dying of nerve gas.
[04:32:43.540 --> 04:32:47.143]  This is just a nothing flu, unless they're lying about it.
[04:32:47.143 --> 04:32:52.047]  And they're acting like it's the end of the world, freaking out, openly setting up complete police state.
[04:32:52.047 --> 04:32:55.269]  Take us out of here, uh, Jaren.
[04:32:55.269 --> 04:32:57.991]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, this is hardcore.
[04:32:57.991 --> 04:32:59.132]  This is serious.
[04:32:59.132 --> 04:33:00.894]  And spread the word to everybody you know.
[04:33:00.894 --> 04:33:03.456]  You'll get the latest info tonight!
[04:33:04.897 --> 04:33:13.364]  9 to midnight Central Standard Time on the GCN Radio Network at M4Wars.com and live at PrisonPlanet.tv with that man right there.
[04:33:13.364 --> 04:33:15.586]  I like the songs, but I don't want to end the show.
[04:33:15.586 --> 04:33:17.327]  I want to keep rocking to it.
[04:33:17.327 --> 04:33:19.829]  Ladies and gentlemen, get fired up!
[04:33:19.829 --> 04:33:21.271]  Get involved!
[04:33:21.271 --> 04:33:22.552]  Stand up against the tyranny.
[04:33:22.552 --> 04:33:25.474]  This was rock music against the East Germans.
[04:33:25.474 --> 04:33:27.956]  It was about standing up to tyranny.
[04:33:27.956 --> 04:33:28.597]  Listen.
[04:33:28.597 --> 04:33:30.078]  Listen up and listen good.
[04:33:34.799 --> 04:33:37.481]  I like it.
[04:33:37.481 --> 04:33:38.461]  I'm not going home.
[04:33:38.461 --> 04:33:39.922]  Come on!
[04:33:39.922 --> 04:33:44.124]  You know, these are the times that tribe meant souls.
[04:33:44.124 --> 04:33:47.566]  We are living in the birth of the New World Order.
[04:33:47.566 --> 04:33:49.948]  This is your medal being tested.
[04:33:49.948 --> 04:33:51.849]  This is reality.
[04:33:51.849 --> 04:33:54.170]  This is your chance to be part of history.
[04:33:54.170 --> 04:33:55.831]  The New World Order is trying to run all over us.
[04:33:55.831 --> 04:34:01.795]  Stand up, resist them, fight back in the info wars, and to protect yourself physically if need be.
[04:34:03.188 --> 04:34:05.275]  God bless them!
[04:34:05.275 --> 04:34:07.983]  They're gonna break the chains!
[04:34:07.983 --> 04:34:08.244]  And you!
[04:34:10.580 --> 04:34:12.261]  Can't stop us!
[04:34:12.261 --> 04:34:14.083]  I want you to spread the word to everybody.
[04:34:14.083 --> 04:34:17.726]  I want to see massive internet numbers tonight on the streams in there.
[04:34:17.726 --> 04:34:19.247]  That's how we gauge things.
[04:34:19.247 --> 04:34:20.809]  And on the AM and FM.
[04:34:20.809 --> 04:34:21.689]  Everybody tune in.
[04:34:21.689 --> 04:34:22.770]  Spread the word tonight.
[04:34:22.770 --> 04:34:23.911]  The latest info.
[04:34:23.911 --> 04:34:25.613]  You'll hear it here, 9 to midnight.
[04:34:25.613 --> 04:34:29.056]  With Jason Burney, the Burmese Info Warrior.
[04:34:29.056 --> 04:34:30.837]  Ha ha!
[04:34:30.837 --> 04:34:32.418]  Alright, great job crew.
[04:34:32.418 --> 04:34:33.359]  We're outta here!
