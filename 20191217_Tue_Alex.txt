[00:00.000 --> 00:21.260]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is December 17th, 2019 on this live Tuesday Worldwide broadcast.
[00:21.260 --> 00:28.860]  And the global awakening is exploding with only 321 days until the historic 2020 elections.
[00:28.860 --> 00:33.120]  And the answer is hitting the streets and confronting globalists everywhere they are
[00:33.120 --> 00:38.800]  with the facts, not leftist screeching, but with the facts.
[00:38.800 --> 00:40.800]  And it's happening.
[00:40.800 --> 00:45.300]  Here's part of what happened in San Antonio this weekend, the video is on InfoWars.com.
[00:45.300 --> 00:46.300]  Here it is.
[00:46.300 --> 01:10.300]  We can't let this happen, the election is about the soul of our nation, and Donald Trump has poisoned our soul, who bans the flames of hate, hate groups, white supremacists, here at home, coming down the escalator when he announced, he said, he was doing it before he hit the ground floor.
[01:10.300 --> 01:18.300]  I already said, he said, I'm going to take on those rapists Mexicans, and I know that this has never been a president.
[01:18.300 --> 01:19.300]  That's a lie, Joe.
[01:19.300 --> 01:20.300]  It's never been a president.
[01:20.300 --> 01:21.300]  That's a lie.
[01:21.300 --> 01:22.300]  Oh, it is a lie.
[01:22.300 --> 01:23.300]  Yeah.
[01:23.300 --> 01:30.300]  And it was your son and the Ukraine.
[01:30.300 --> 01:33.300]  We're not going to give you the billion dollars.
[01:33.300 --> 01:34.300]  They said, you have no authority.
[01:34.300 --> 01:35.300]  You're not the president.
[01:35.300 --> 01:37.300]  The president said, I said, call him.
[01:37.300 --> 01:40.300]  I said, I'm telling you, you're not getting the billion dollars.
[01:40.300 --> 01:43.300]  You're the one that offered to withhold a billion dollars.
[01:43.300 --> 01:44.300]  Bam.
[01:44.300 --> 01:46.300]  The cancel of foreign relations.
[01:46.300 --> 01:48.300]  I said, you're not getting the billion.
[01:48.300 --> 01:49.300]  I'm going to be leaving here.
[01:49.300 --> 01:50.300]  And I think it was what, six hours?
[01:50.300 --> 01:52.300]  I looked, I said, I'm leaving at six hours.
[01:52.300 --> 01:55.300]  If the prosecutor's not fired, you're not getting the money.
[01:55.300 --> 01:57.300]  Oh, son of a bitch.
[01:57.300 --> 01:59.300]  You got fired.
[01:59.300 --> 02:03.300]  Son of a bitch, you got fired, right, Joe?
[02:03.300 --> 02:06.300]  Son of a bitch, you got fired, right?
[02:06.300 --> 02:10.300]  Son of a bitch, you got fired.
[02:10.300 --> 02:12.300]  Trump is innocent.
[02:12.300 --> 02:15.300]  Trump is innocent.
[02:15.300 --> 02:17.300]  Infowars.com.
[02:17.300 --> 02:19.300]  Infowars.com.
[02:19.300 --> 02:21.300]  Just total victory, man.
[02:21.300 --> 02:47.300]  There's a reason the globalists are fighting so hard to shut us down.
[02:47.300 --> 02:52.300]  And make no mistake, this is a war of wills.
[02:52.300 --> 03:01.300]  Infowars' main mission is to expose the globalist blueprint, rally humanity, and stop them dead in their tracks.
[03:01.300 --> 03:14.300]  As modern Paul reveres, it's critical for all Americans to do their part in the animating contest of liberty to expose darkness and promote freedom and a pro-human future everywhere we go.
[03:14.300 --> 03:16.300]  The quickening is here.
[03:16.300 --> 03:23.300]  We are now entering the crossroads, and Infowars is rising to the challenge.
[03:23.300 --> 03:30.300]  Infowars and our dedicated, committed crew is fighting harder than ever.
[03:30.300 --> 03:35.300]  We live in the most historical times ever seen in the history of our species.
[03:35.300 --> 03:39.300]  Everyone can see it, they can feel it, they can taste it.
[03:39.300 --> 03:43.300]  But now, it's all going to the next level.
[03:43.300 --> 03:48.300]  Evil is rising, and to challenge it, good is rising as well.
[03:48.300 --> 03:57.300]  The fact that you're awake, the fact that you're involved, the fact that you're engaged, even in the smallest way, is giant.
[03:57.300 --> 04:00.300]  It's massive. It's consciousness.
[04:00.300 --> 04:13.300]  Now, as the year 2020 dawns, we must redouble our efforts like never before in the fight to bring down the Deke State and defeat the globalist anti-human system.
[04:13.300 --> 04:37.300]  But the only way our information gets out is when you spread it, and when you support it by funding our operations, which are your operations at infowarstore.com.
[04:37.300 --> 04:44.300]  We have achieved so much of our goals against the globalists, but now the real war is starting.
[04:44.300 --> 04:47.300]  It's an incredibly historic time to be alive. I'm so blessed to be here.
[04:47.300 --> 04:58.300]  And thanks to you, the people of the world, standing with Infowars, and standing with other organizations to support Liberty, we're going to win this thing.
[04:58.300 --> 05:07.300]  It's your last chance to get the original designer limited edition Jeffrey Epstein Christmas sweater.
[05:07.300 --> 05:20.300]  The globalists are so scared of this story continuing to come out for people learning about the Deke State and the international blackmail rings using kidnapped women and children to compromise world leaders.
[05:20.300 --> 05:33.300]  We do not want this story continuing, and this is your last chance to get the limited edition Christmas sweater at infowarstore.com to help spread the word, to have a piece of history, and to fund our operation.
[05:33.300 --> 05:39.300]  So, again, it says Christmas lights are a lot like Epstein, that these things don't hang themselves on the front.
[05:39.300 --> 05:45.300]  On the back, it's got infowars.com and shows the O in infowars as a wreath that's also a noose.
[05:45.300 --> 05:53.300]  This system can't stand it when you promote things to the grassroots level. They can't stand it when you fund independent pro-America, pro-human media.
[05:53.300 --> 06:17.300]  So, you've got to take advantage of this shirt and get it today, infowars.com.
[06:23.300 --> 06:52.300]  Live. Raw. Untamed and uncensored. We are alive. We are the heart of the pro-human rebellion against the globalist technocrats and their post-human nightmare.
[06:52.300 --> 07:01.300]  Global domination plan. And we are going to ring the alarm bells. And we are going to rally the human spirit.
[07:01.300 --> 07:13.300]  And we are going to trigger an awakening from the trance. And we are going to destroy the globalist and take our place.
[07:13.300 --> 07:30.300]  God has prepared for us in the stars and beyond. The only way we'll ever be fulfilled.
[07:30.300 --> 07:40.300]  Oh my my. It is such an incredible thing to be conscious.
[07:40.300 --> 07:45.300]  Alright, let me lay it out.
[07:45.300 --> 07:52.300]  I didn't want people to be too confident.
[07:52.300 --> 08:02.300]  And I know they have a lot of tricks up their sleeves. And I knew that the impeachment in the house was going to end up happening because they had the votes they couldn't help themselves.
[08:02.300 --> 08:15.300]  And I said there's a 70% chance it's going to fail. Now, if you remember that almost three months ago before it all kicked off, Pelosi telegraphed the talking points about they already had the articles written up.
[08:15.300 --> 08:25.300]  And then she'd play the game in the news that she didn't want to tear America apart.
[08:25.300 --> 08:35.300]  And I said then they're going to get their indictment in the house and they're going to have their show trial by Christmas because Pelosi said, well, I don't want this to happen.
[08:35.300 --> 08:41.300]  But if it does, here's my plan. And then within a week of that, they launched the operation.
[08:41.300 --> 08:47.300]  It's all completely scripted. And that's now all been admitted. They're not even hiding.
[08:47.300 --> 08:55.300]  There's still a 30% chance of them being able to create enough hysteria to hurt the markets is what it's really about.
[08:55.300 --> 09:14.300]  And then trigger social unrest with some false flags, rape allegations against the president would add the icing on the cake to try to get a 22nd Amendment move
[09:14.300 --> 09:22.300]  to remove the president saying that he's mentally unstable.
[09:22.300 --> 09:25.300]  I don't like to be overconfident, but I just have to tell you the truth.
[09:25.300 --> 09:30.300]  And I think you all pick up on this. You don't need me to tell you this.
[09:30.300 --> 09:41.300]  The American people, the populist movements worldwide, President Trump are kicking the living daylights out of the globalist.
[09:41.300 --> 09:57.300]  We are to use an analogy, caving their ribs in, ripping their noses completely off their faces, gouging their eyeballs out right now and skull effing them.
[09:57.300 --> 10:05.300]  And I'm sorry, I have more prudent ways to describe it, but they would not be true.
[10:05.300 --> 10:12.300]  This is a delicious route of the enemy.
[10:12.300 --> 10:17.300]  They are disintegrating in front of our very eyes.
[10:17.300 --> 10:26.300]  But if you don't realize, and I know you do, but if other people like the president don't realize that this is when they're at their most dangerous.
[10:26.300 --> 10:35.300]  We do not need to sit back and gloat. We need to dispatch them politically as quickly as possible and not wait when they're in our crosshairs.
[10:35.300 --> 10:49.300]  We need to pull the political, nonviolent trigger and put this rabid pack of rabies-infested zombies down.
[10:49.300 --> 10:58.300]  The multinationals had basically taken the country over. They were getting ready to fully implode it and bring the chai-coms in for the new global communist century and the CFRs on words.
[10:58.300 --> 11:06.300]  All of that is being pulled out from under them right now.
[11:06.300 --> 11:27.300]  This republic, despite all of our evil and our excesses, has the providence of God because of the type of individuals that founded us, the type of individuals that have fought for our future and put everything they had forward for the future destiny of the new Atlantis.
[11:27.300 --> 11:40.300]  Now, we've squandered most of that. We are a pathetic shadow of our former selves and the metal that made us. But compared to all the other collapsing countries, because humanity's in major decline,
[11:40.300 --> 12:09.300]  I gotta quote the Beatles and Helter Skelter. We're coming down fast, but we're miles above them on our journey to hell. Without Christ, we will fall completely, not just partially.
[12:09.300 --> 12:21.300]  And I know some people out there who like the show and are more libertarian are offended by my constant references to Jesus Christ, but the system hates it.
[12:21.300 --> 12:34.300]  And I wouldn't be here without Christ. And I'm like a man in a storm on a tiny ship. And the only thing guiding me through the storm is Christ, my North Star.
[12:34.300 --> 12:52.300]  And so there are no atheists and foxholes. And so I cannot help but proclaim who my Lord, Master, Director, Savior, King, Commander, absolute controller is.
[12:52.300 --> 12:58.300]  I mean, I wish God would just take full control of me, but that's not how God operates. I have free will constantly.
[12:58.300 --> 13:05.300]  And so it is a schizophrenic existence for anybody that's fallen and has the flesh and knowledge of evil and good.
[13:05.300 --> 13:12.300]  It has a relationship with the Creator because you have such advanced knowledge of the universe and such an incredible connection in the quiet place.
[13:12.300 --> 13:22.300]  The most high where you can always go to for solace with God, but then have to re enter into the matrix and see all of this and see people going along with it.
[13:22.300 --> 13:29.300]  When they had sight, spiritual vision, they would never join with Satan.
[13:29.300 --> 13:36.300]  I'm going to stop preaching right there because I've got to get to the news.
[13:36.300 --> 13:43.300]  The globalists are in free fall. And if you look at everybody that's opposing them and fighting them, they are electrified.
[13:43.300 --> 13:49.300]  They are animated. They're always 10 steps ahead of the enemy.
[13:49.300 --> 13:54.300]  But the enemy is going to strike back in very nasty ways. And we know how they're going to do it because the enemy is very formulaic.
[13:54.300 --> 13:58.300]  It's going to be false flags. What are those going to look like?
[13:58.300 --> 14:04.300]  They could plunge the economy. They're certainly trying as hard as they can.
[14:04.300 --> 14:16.300]  But Trump's using their own system against them right now, which is even more satisfactional, satisfactory, satisfying, delicious, rich.
[14:16.300 --> 14:25.300]  But we really shouldn't gloat. It's more a feeling of dissatisfaction.
[14:25.300 --> 14:31.300]  And should look at our weak points because we've been behind for the first half of the game.
[14:31.300 --> 14:39.300]  And now in the first opening minutes of the second half, if you look at historical timeframes, we have exploded and put five or six touchdowns on the board.
[14:39.300 --> 14:43.300]  Something obviously impossible in football, but real in the political.
[14:43.300 --> 14:48.300]  And so there is a massive fire against the globalist, a huge awakening.
[14:48.300 --> 14:51.300]  And generals are always fighting the last war.
[14:51.300 --> 14:56.300]  So the globalists are like, well, Jones and his audience of activists helped initiate this worldwide.
[14:56.300 --> 15:05.300]  They've tracked it back to us and others, but we're the main vector point as they openly call us on CNN and in Congress and at the leftist run CIA.
[15:05.300 --> 15:08.300]  I'm called the virus. I'm called the one that did it.
[15:08.300 --> 15:13.300]  It's all of us together. We're just a focal point here. But we did breach the main enemy wall.
[15:13.300 --> 15:18.300]  We've now entered. We've taken over most of the systems. We freed the minds of the people.
[15:18.300 --> 15:20.300]  We've initiated the domino collapse.
[15:20.300 --> 15:29.300]  And so the enemy is trying to go back in time and take out info wars from something we already did.
[15:29.300 --> 15:34.300]  Instead of trying to stop what's already happening in the present about to happen in the future.
[15:34.300 --> 15:42.300]  But nevertheless, taking us out would be successful in new operations and permutations.
[15:42.300 --> 15:48.300]  We intend to trigger reading the intergalactic tea leaves in the future.
[15:48.300 --> 15:52.300]  All right, I'm going right into the news and the global awakening and more proofs of it.
[15:52.300 --> 16:07.300]  Your phone calls and a bunch of guests coming up today today.
[16:07.300 --> 16:25.300]  We're going to go right into the news and the global awakening and more proofs of it.
[16:25.300 --> 16:45.300]  We're going to go right into the news and the global awakening and more proofs of it.
[16:45.300 --> 17:14.300]  We're going to go right into the news and the global awakening and more proofs of it.
[17:14.300 --> 17:39.300]  We're going to go right into the news and the global awakening and more proofs of it.
[17:39.300 --> 17:58.300]  We're going to go right into the news and the global awakening and more proofs of it.
[17:58.300 --> 18:14.300]  My fault, my fear. I thought that you'd want what I want. I'm sorry, my dear.
[18:14.300 --> 18:30.300]  But where are the clowns? Send in the clowns. Don't bother there.
[18:30.300 --> 18:34.300]  The globalists have sent in the clowns. They've sent in antifa.
[18:34.300 --> 18:38.300]  They've broken our borders with some of the most hardened criminals from around the world.
[18:38.300 --> 18:42.300]  They've tried to poison us with fluoride and GMO and the tainted vaccines.
[18:42.300 --> 18:44.300]  They've sent in their clowns.
[18:44.300 --> 18:49.300]  But now the men and women of America are taking action and confronting globalists everywhere.
[18:49.300 --> 18:52.300]  And I'm so proud of M4s leading the charge.
[18:52.300 --> 18:56.300]  But the only way we can do that is when you keep spreading the word about our broadcast
[18:56.300 --> 18:59.300]  and when you keep buying the great products at m4store.com.
[18:59.300 --> 19:02.300]  The best product. I'm not supposed to be biased, but I'm going to tell you all now.
[19:02.300 --> 19:04.300]  If you haven't tried turbo force, you need to try it.
[19:04.300 --> 19:07.300]  I've tried turbo force with everything.
[19:07.300 --> 19:10.300]  Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy. I put turbo force in my coffee.
[19:10.300 --> 19:12.300]  It was a crazy week. I don't remember sleeping.
[19:12.300 --> 19:14.300]  But as far as the products go, turbo force is my favorite.
[19:14.300 --> 19:19.300]  And all the Infowars products are down to taking control of your life, taking control of your health,
[19:19.300 --> 19:22.300]  not relying on other people to do it for you.
[19:22.300 --> 19:25.300]  Nobody wakes up in the morning and thinks,
[19:25.300 --> 19:27.300]  I'm going to give that person over there a better life.
[19:27.300 --> 19:30.300]  I'm going to wake up today. You know what? I'm going to spend my entire day
[19:30.300 --> 19:33.300]  trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier and richer.
[19:33.300 --> 19:35.300]  I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend.
[19:35.300 --> 19:37.300]  I don't think that happens very often. It's never happened to me.
[19:37.300 --> 19:39.300]  I've never had anyone knock on my door and said,
[19:39.300 --> 19:42.300]  Tate, you're such a good guy. How can I improve your life in every single way?
[19:42.300 --> 19:45.300]  There's only one person who woke up and thought that, and that was me.
[19:45.300 --> 19:47.300]  I woke up and thought, you know what? Okay.
[19:47.300 --> 19:49.300]  I want to take control of my life. I want to take control of my health.
[19:49.300 --> 19:52.300]  And that's why you need to go to Infowars.com, take control of your health right now
[19:52.300 --> 19:54.300]  and support the resistance. Don't buy into the group thing.
[19:54.300 --> 19:56.300]  Don't drink the Kool-Aid. Drink the turbo force.
[19:56.300 --> 20:10.300]  Kool-Aid's bad and the turbo force is good.
[20:26.300 --> 20:34.300]  Well, so does he. Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[20:34.300 --> 20:47.300]  Election fraud, organized computer hacking directed by elements of the deep state.
[20:47.300 --> 20:54.300]  Individuals voting in the names of deceased voters or voters who've moved out of the district,
[20:54.300 --> 20:56.300]  moved out of the state years before.
[20:56.300 --> 21:01.300]  That's President Trump and America's Achilles' heel.
[21:01.300 --> 21:04.300]  And that's 321 days out right now.
[21:04.300 --> 21:08.300]  And we'll be covering that with Bev Harris and other computer experts in the coming weeks
[21:08.300 --> 21:13.300]  and months in great detail and talking about strategies for the president to take action.
[21:13.300 --> 21:18.300]  Allowing the wholesale oppression and massive censorship of the American people.
[21:18.300 --> 21:22.300]  That's a dereliction of duty by the president not to take action against the racketeering,
[21:22.300 --> 21:26.300]  the organized crime. He said again this week that he's going to take action.
[21:26.300 --> 21:30.300]  They played the clip on Fox News. We'll see.
[21:30.300 --> 21:34.300]  I'm not holding my breath. I love the president. Love a lot of what he's done.
[21:34.300 --> 21:39.300]  Thank God for him every day.
[21:39.300 --> 21:45.300]  That's the negative. Let's talk about the positive that outweighs at big time.
[21:45.300 --> 21:55.300]  I am not a deceiver. In fact, I've never told lies on air knowingly.
[21:55.300 --> 22:01.300]  I've made mistakes before. A few percentage points out of 100. I get things wrong.
[22:01.300 --> 22:05.300]  I always interchange the 25th amendment and the 22nd amendment.
[22:05.300 --> 22:08.300]  One is saying you shouldn't serve more than two terms.
[22:08.300 --> 22:12.300]  The other says that if your cabinet gets together, they can remove you.
[22:12.300 --> 22:16.300]  If they think you're crazy or incapacitated. I mean, I do stuff like that.
[22:16.300 --> 22:21.300]  But I consciously never lie to this audience.
[22:21.300 --> 22:28.300]  I was thinking about this last night and this morning and it borders on a lie.
[22:28.300 --> 22:36.300]  And I'm not guilty feeling, but it is bordering on the dark arts of politics.
[22:36.300 --> 22:41.300]  Something I know how to do because I follow it, but I don't ever engage in it.
[22:41.300 --> 22:45.300]  And you know what? I didn't lie to you because I thought back.
[22:45.300 --> 22:50.300]  I said a lot on air. Hey, I don't want you to be overconfident.
[22:50.300 --> 22:56.300]  Like a football team again goes in at half time and the other team hadn't made a single point.
[22:56.300 --> 23:01.300]  And you're at, you know, 24 points on the board.
[23:01.300 --> 23:07.300]  It's like in Pulp Fiction when they've got a plan to cover up the dead body and the wolf says,
[23:07.300 --> 23:16.300]  hey, let's not start celebrating here quite yet till it's all completed.
[23:16.300 --> 23:22.300]  A bullet in the brains on enough. You got to put the body in the ground to use a euphemism.
[23:22.300 --> 23:30.300]  A parallel, a parable, an allegory, an analogy.
[23:30.300 --> 23:34.300]  And I said on air, impeachment will be a disaster for them.
[23:34.300 --> 23:39.300]  They're probably going to backfire spectacularly because they have no evidence and they've already lied so much.
[23:39.300 --> 23:46.300]  They've already been caught lying so much that they'd awaited and not lied the last three years with Russian gate and all the rest of it.
[23:46.300 --> 23:49.300]  And rape gate with Kavanaugh.
[23:49.300 --> 23:57.300]  That if they'd awaited and done this, they would have probably had a good shot at removing him in the Senate, at least a better shot.
[23:57.300 --> 24:01.300]  But because they lied so much, I didn't see them having any shot.
[24:01.300 --> 24:06.300]  That's why most political analysts said, oh, three months ago, Pelosi and others,
[24:06.300 --> 24:14.300]  they're never going to try to actually have the House hold impeachment because they'll not get the indictment because there's no evidence.
[24:14.300 --> 24:18.300]  Because even if it goes to the Senate, it'll fail then and they'll look like idiots.
[24:18.300 --> 24:23.300]  And I said, listen, these people aren't leaders. They're puppets.
[24:23.300 --> 24:31.300]  And even if the globalists think they're going to lose, an impeachment process will hurt the country and tear the nation apart.
[24:31.300 --> 24:38.300]  And could trigger civil unrest, especially with the Soros, trying to get race riots and things going constantly.
[24:38.300 --> 24:42.300]  So I said, I don't want to go down that road because it's playing with fire.
[24:42.300 --> 24:50.300]  But since they did it, because the low key in me knew where this was going to go.
[24:50.300 --> 24:56.300]  And you all knew too, but we didn't want to roll the dice with our children and grandchildren, did we?
[24:56.300 --> 25:01.300]  But they sure did. And now it's their world. They put themselves in it.
[25:01.300 --> 25:07.300]  So now let's make sure it's as damaging to the globalist and these evil Democrats and their pedophile party as it can be.
[25:07.300 --> 25:15.300]  Because let me tell you, I almost a few months ago went on air and said, this is going to blow up in their face.
[25:15.300 --> 25:25.300]  Oh my God, there's such idiots. And I just said, no, don't interrupt your enemy when they're destroying themselves to quote Napoleon Bonaparte.
[25:25.300 --> 25:32.300]  So I mean, I thought about it. I prayed about it. I almost came on air and said, this is going to be their waterloo.
[25:32.300 --> 25:38.300]  It's going to destroy them. But they really listened to me. I'm not bragging. I'm not. They listen.
[25:38.300 --> 25:46.300]  They know I'm not playing games and I've got a good eye on the future and how things are going to unfold more than almost anybody in politics.
[25:46.300 --> 25:51.300]  I mean, I know what I'm talking about. I have a lot of knowledge bases.
[25:51.300 --> 26:01.300]  And if I had jumped up and down and celebrated and said, oh my God, they're about to screw the pooch, there's a chance they might not have done it.
[26:01.300 --> 26:10.300]  So I've just got to be honest. I talked about how Trump was in great danger and they're killing today is in great danger.
[26:10.300 --> 26:23.300]  It's just that the probability was so great that they were going to screw themselves that it is a form of deception that I didn't really point out that they were about to destroy themselves.
[26:23.300 --> 26:32.300]  But I just couldn't help it because so many times I've sat back and never been Machiavelli and been completely honest about things on air.
[26:32.300 --> 26:40.300]  Like they were putting out big memes funded by Time Warner that were getting like 20 million views a week, attacking me and all it was doing was waking up young people.
[26:40.300 --> 26:49.300]  And it was just the biggest thing ever helping us. And I celebrated it and at first they thought I was trying to get them to stop with reverse psychology.
[26:49.300 --> 26:54.300]  No, I loved it. They got everybody else to make memes too.
[26:54.300 --> 26:59.300]  That was already happening grassroots. So they did nasty memes that only backfired because I embraced it.
[26:59.300 --> 27:04.300]  And then I said, oh my God, this is wonderful. And they stopped it.
[27:04.300 --> 27:10.300]  I mean, they had super deluxe and all these big outfits hitting me every week and it was just gold.
[27:10.300 --> 27:15.300]  I mean, I would go to a sports event with my kids in a public school because you're there in private school, but we're in a public.
[27:15.300 --> 27:20.300]  And we go to a bigger. I was like, just the kids thought I was a rock star.
[27:20.300 --> 27:24.300]  Back in the 80s rock stars were cool or whatever. Well, it's rock star and it still is.
[27:24.300 --> 27:31.300]  But I was honest about that and they stopped it. Still, it's huge.
[27:31.300 --> 27:35.300]  And if I had that over to do, I wouldn't have gloated. I wouldn't have enjoyed it.
[27:35.300 --> 27:39.300]  The New York Times, you know, said had a big headline. Alex Jones wants to be in the meme war.
[27:39.300 --> 27:46.300]  He wants you to make memes. And so did the Wall Street Journal and they stopped the big corporate attack memes because they didn't know what they were doing.
[27:46.300 --> 27:52.300]  They had no idea how these young people's brains work. It was just, it was perfect. Please don't throw me in the briar patch.
[27:52.300 --> 28:00.300]  So what is the audience thinking me doing that? I'm open the phones up later because that's how you go over the dark side, though,
[28:00.300 --> 28:07.300]  is little increments of wanting to beat them. You can't join them because one day you're like Pelosi and don't know truth from lies
[28:07.300 --> 28:11.300]  and just spew false garbage. She was saying she has a medical license last week.
[28:11.300 --> 28:18.300]  I mean, the woman is completely insane. They all are. They're turned over to delusion.
[28:18.300 --> 28:25.300]  So was that a deception? No, Trump's in real danger. And if you don't take it serious, we're in trouble and people should get out there on the streets
[28:25.300 --> 28:33.300]  and get in the Democrats face. But I mean, they are, they are screwed.
[28:33.300 --> 28:39.300]  I mean, they, they have lost everybody. It is, it is dramatic what just happened.
[28:39.300 --> 28:43.300]  I would expect them to start blowing up federal buildings this week, next week or something like that to blame it on us.
[28:43.300 --> 28:46.300]  I mean, here's the thing, though, they're going to counter strike.
[28:46.300 --> 28:51.300]  And I mean, 100% of what I just said, the problem is they don't have full control of the government now, so they can't cover it up as well.
[28:51.300 --> 28:57.300]  So they're paralyzed. This is beautiful. Thank you, Lord.
[28:57.300 --> 29:03.300]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain, the hottest financial sector without all the speculation.
[29:03.300 --> 29:08.300]  No, enjoy a 27% annualized payment each month without the ups and downs of Bitcoin.
[29:08.300 --> 29:16.300]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[29:16.300 --> 29:24.300]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[29:24.300 --> 29:35.300]  Non-security IPO or note, blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each month.
[29:35.300 --> 29:43.300]  Don't miss this one. Stake your claim today. Call 800-600-3388. That's 800-600-3388.
[29:43.300 --> 29:48.300]  These valuable lease contracts won't last long. Call now 800-600-3388.
[29:48.300 --> 29:57.300]  Equipment offer poses a financial risk to owners consult with financial professionals before purchasing not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an offering document.
[29:57.300 --> 30:07.300]  The globalists think America's done. The globalists think the West is done. They think the Christians are done and finished.
[30:07.300 --> 30:14.300]  They believe they've broken our backs. They believe that with big tech censorship we'll just crawl into ditches and submit to them.
[30:14.300 --> 30:26.300]  And they believe that if they can demonize and shut down info wars that they rightfully see as a symbol, a beacon of populism and freedom, not just to America but to the whole world, that they can demoralize everybody else and win.
[30:26.300 --> 30:33.300]  Why? If they can shut info wars down, they can intimidate everybody else. That's why it's beyond critical that you keep info wars on the air.
[30:33.300 --> 30:37.300]  It's only by your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support that we're on air.

[33:08.300 --> 33:31.300]  Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[34:08.300 --> 34:28.300]  Nobody's in it. Goes in and then you really feel the spirit of God. Listen to this part right here.
[34:28.300 --> 34:46.300]  We need to play that whole song sometime because it talks about going into the church, talks about hitting their knees. We need to get that full song on the computer and play that part of the song. We come back next segment.
[34:46.300 --> 34:52.300]  That was a dramatic cliffhanger.
[34:52.300 --> 35:03.300]  Now, I want to give the number out and I want to take calls starting in the next segment.
[35:03.300 --> 35:10.300]  We do have some special guests in studio. The bottom of the next hour.
[35:10.300 --> 35:26.300]  I specifically want to take your calls on what is the deep state going to do as it loses more and more control of the government and as their attempt to remove the president and bully his supporters in and out of government backfires spectacularly.
[35:26.300 --> 35:40.300]  Because this is turned into a route. And again, that's in the old fashioned term of two armies colliding. There's a battle. The other army gives up throws down their weapons and starts running away. That's now happening.
[35:40.300 --> 35:43.300]  This is becoming a route.
[35:43.300 --> 35:57.300]  But their captains, their generals, their field marshals, their leadership is still sitting up there on their horses, commanding armies that don't exist.
[35:57.300 --> 36:04.300]  Like Hitler and his bunker in 1945 under the Reich chancellery.
[36:04.300 --> 36:09.300]  History is repeating itself again.
[36:09.300 --> 36:14.300]  And I can smell victory.
[36:14.300 --> 36:17.300]  I can taste victory.
[36:17.300 --> 36:19.300]  I can see victory.
[36:19.300 --> 36:21.300]  I can feel victory.
[36:21.300 --> 36:31.300]  It's not a total victory over all the evils the world, the problems we face, but over this rotting edifice of arrogant globalist puppets.
[36:31.300 --> 36:43.300]  They're being run by the chai comms and the globalist. They're being routed everywhere across the planet right now. And they have thrown their full power.
[36:43.300 --> 36:53.300]  They've attempted to have race wars and Islamic attacks and plunging economies and just you name it.
[36:53.300 --> 37:01.300]  Everywhere they go and everything they do, people are watching now and are picking up on the lies.
[37:01.300 --> 37:14.300]  Comey came out last week when they put out the report, which did remove the guilt, but damned them in the report.
[37:14.300 --> 37:20.300]  And then the testimony and he said, oh, I'm glad the report points out no one ever spied on Trump.
[37:20.300 --> 37:29.300]  He came out on the Sunday show Sunday and said, actually, I was wrong. The president was spied on wrongly.
[37:29.300 --> 37:39.300]  Now he's made other statements, mistakes more consequential than FISA abuses occurred while he had an FBI.
[37:39.300 --> 37:45.300]  This is the guy that lied to Congress and said he was never was a whistleblower, never a leaker.
[37:45.300 --> 37:50.300]  Though he would give it to the dean of a journalism school.
[37:50.300 --> 37:56.300]  That's like if I'm a mafia Don and I tell a captain, go have one of your soldiers kill this person.
[37:56.300 --> 38:07.300]  The Don is just as guilty as the guy that pulls the trigger. In fact, more so because he conceived the plot.
[38:07.300 --> 38:15.300]  The boss. That's what Don means. The boss. Comey gave the order because he got it from his boss.
[38:15.300 --> 38:21.300]  The boss of bosses. You know who that is.
[38:21.300 --> 38:27.300]  It's a committee. They gave him that order.
[38:27.300 --> 38:32.300]  He went and gave it to the dean of a major journalism school.
[38:32.300 --> 38:39.300]  He later named the person and said that's not a leak.
[38:39.300 --> 38:46.300]  And what he put out was a bunch of BS on top of it.
[38:46.300 --> 38:50.300]  And so America and the world is waking up.
[38:50.300 --> 38:54.300]  I've said this a thousand times. I'll say it again before we were asleep.
[38:54.300 --> 38:57.300]  And they were bullying us thinking, oh man, we really have bullied these people.
[38:57.300 --> 39:03.300]  These mental medjits didn't get it. We were fat dumb and happy, not paying attention, busy.
[39:03.300 --> 39:13.300]  Everything they've done now, every day I see too many videos even play of just Republican women coming out of an event
[39:13.300 --> 39:19.300]  and left us and people screaming F you whores and throwing things at them and people throwing bottles at myself
[39:19.300 --> 39:24.300]  and Owen Shroyer and all the stuff that's happened over the years.
[39:24.300 --> 39:31.300]  Bags of feces. Do they think that intimidates us? It makes us work twice as hard.
[39:31.300 --> 39:38.300]  And now you're seeing the crop come in the last four or five years of their bullying and intimidation.
[39:38.300 --> 39:45.300]  So I'll open the phones up and get your take on all this and how they're going to strike back because, yes, this is pretty spectacular what's going on.
[39:45.300 --> 39:53.300]  Main street media is going to put a face on like everything's fine and everybody's going back to sleep and Trump's really going to get removed from the Senate.
[39:53.300 --> 40:03.300]  But even with all the curveballs are going to throw, no one's going to buy any more bull because they know these people have cried wolves so many times.
[40:03.300 --> 40:06.300]  So how are they going to try to extricate their bacon?
[40:06.300 --> 40:24.300]  Toll free number to join us 877-789-2539 first time callers 877-789-2539 877-789 Alex in that first round of calls. I want to get first time callers.
[40:24.300 --> 40:35.300]  But since I mentioned this, here's just one of the clips of Comey saying mistakes were consequential and then I've had another example of over across the pond what's happening with a hot mic.
[40:35.300 --> 40:37.300]  But here's Comey.
[40:37.300 --> 40:43.300]  If you were still there and all of this came out and it turned out it happened on your watch, would you resign?
[40:43.300 --> 40:54.300]  No, I don't think so. The mistakes I consider more consequential than this during my tenure and the important thing is to be transparent about it and then look to fix it and explain to the American people how you fix it.
[40:54.300 --> 40:56.300]  Couple of final questions.
[40:56.300 --> 41:08.300]  So, oh, now there are problems. Now there are things more consequential. He came out on the Sunday shows and said, oh, I guess there was mine.
[41:08.300 --> 41:20.300]  He tried to put tweets out and put an article out, an op-ed that was all over the country published saying that the president's crazy.
[41:20.300 --> 41:23.300]  Nobody ever spot on him when it's in the damn report.
[41:23.300 --> 41:36.300]  Well, that didn't work. You notice he's withdrawing that now because he's not getting away with it anymore. You notice Chris Wallace, that little rat.
[41:36.300 --> 41:40.300]  You notice he's been all against Trump now. He's pulling back because it didn't work.
[41:40.300 --> 41:54.300]  Now even they realized, oh, wait, this screwed up. But hey, the Senate trial still has to come now. Or will the Democrats choke? And will they withdraw the impeachment vote?
[41:54.300 --> 41:59.300]  They're having their last committee hearing right now. We've got some clips of that that are happening as we speak when we come back.
[41:59.300 --> 42:08.300]  What are they going to do? I want to hear from you. I really respect your opinions. Your views, 877-789, Alex.
[42:08.300 --> 42:14.300]  The right to come back with hot Mike moment exposes insane sleaziness of British political mass media.
[42:14.300 --> 42:21.300]  This is like a face in the crowd moment. And it ties him to no two champagne with billionaires, Boris Johnson to boycott debos.
[42:21.300 --> 42:27.300]  I think you ought to go get in their face like Trump does. I'm all for meeting with your enemies. You get a lot of intel that way.
[42:27.300 --> 42:32.300]  But okay, he's got work to do. I get it. Boris, okay, we support you.
[42:32.300 --> 42:38.300]  Another bellwether of how much trouble the New World Order is in. Please don't forget the 12 days of Christmas are here.
[42:38.300 --> 42:47.300]  Huge sales across the board. Store on free shipping, infowarstore.com. Is there a place you could spend your money where it would fight globalism and stand up for your freedoms more?

[42:57.300 --> 43:05.300]  It's your last chance to get the original designer limited edition Jeffrey Epstein Christmas sweater.
[43:05.300 --> 43:18.300]  The globalists are so scared of this story continuing to come out for people learning about the deep state and the international blackmail rings using kidnap women and children to compromise world leaders.
[43:18.300 --> 43:31.300]  They do not want this story continuing. And this is your last chance to get the limited edition Christmas sweater at infowarstore.com to help spread the word, to have a piece of history, and to fund our operation.
[43:31.300 --> 43:43.300]  So again, it says Christmas lights are a lot like Epstein. These things don't hang themselves on the front. On the back, it's got infowars.com and shows the O in infowars as a wreath. It's also a noose.
[43:43.300 --> 43:55.300]  The system can't stand it when you promote things at the grassroots level. They can't stand it when you fund independent pro America, pro human media. That's why you've got to take advantage of this shirt and get it today.
[43:55.300 --> 44:16.300]  infowars.com.
[44:25.300 --> 44:34.300]  Without you, we're going to lose this fight. I need all of you to realize how important you are and how important infowars is and what we've done together.
[44:34.300 --> 44:43.300]  And to just take stock and take measure at the end of the year and think about what you're going to do, whether supporting infowars or buying products from us or starting your own show.

[44:59.300 --> 45:18.300]  I've got a problem that I want to confess to the listeners and viewers. I've been on the air so long that I take it for granted now when we break some massive story that changes the whole world and that really does great things for the future of not just our children, but our children's children.
[45:18.300 --> 45:28.300]  Infowars really has changed history. And that's why I need to pull back and ask the listeners, because I know you're a lot like me, to really think about a world without infowars.
[45:28.300 --> 45:38.300]  Because I can tell you right now, if people don't really step to the plate and really financially support our broadcast going into 2020, we're not going to be on the air in a year or so.
[45:38.300 --> 45:49.300]  If you do support us, we're not just going to stay on the air, but we are going to expand in ways that are going to blow you away. I've never let you down. You've never let me down.
[45:49.300 --> 45:58.300]  Step up to the plate now. Go to infowars.com. Buy great products and fund our operation and watch us make history together again.
[45:58.300 --> 46:10.300]  Christmas is here and it's time to give yourself, your family and your loved ones the gift of having incredible energy, stamina, focus, libido.
[46:10.300 --> 46:20.300]  Now look, there are a lot of stimulants out there that will give you that for a while but then burn you out. But if you have the foundation of what your body needs, then it takes you to the next level.
[46:20.300 --> 46:33.300]  Real Red Pill and Real Red Pill Plus are total game changing formulas. Then you add to that our Biotru Selenium from the mustard seed. It is the most powerful electro transmitter in the body.

[46:52.300 --> 47:17.300]  Get the Real Red Pill, Real Red Pill Plus combo with the free bottle of Biotru Selenium in 4store.com.
[47:22.300 --> 47:37.300]  From the Infowars.com Studios, it's Alex Jones.
[47:37.300 --> 47:47.300]  Bob, Josh, Chase, Coy, Griff, Marion, Angel, Tim, JK, we're going to all your calls. Like I'm going to start some in this segment, but I'm going to play some clips first.
[47:47.300 --> 47:58.300]  Now, this isn't as powerful for radio. And still, most of our audience is AM and FM affiliates out there. The left tried to get us to be platformed off of those.
[47:58.300 --> 48:07.300]  And the radio station owners and managers told them go to hell, actually got us more affiliates. Some of the threat stations got, by the way, in the last year and a half from the Soros groups.
[48:07.300 --> 48:24.300]  They had national news stories listing stations and saying, call and harass them. Was it take us from nighttime rearing us to putting us on prime time? So in trying to intimidate conservative and Christian radio stations and telling them what to put on air doesn't have the same effect as trying to bully and intimidate big tech,
[48:24.300 --> 48:38.300]  because big tech is like you and hates America. So just a little sad note of how real psychology works for you globalist knuckle dragon, anti-American filth. The Fed office country too long, sorry.
[48:38.300 --> 48:52.300]  This is particularly powerful of your TV viewer. The video goes up on Infowars.com. Hot Mike Moment exposes insane sleaziness of British political media class. It's from medium.com.
[48:52.300 --> 49:05.300]  These people aren't like you and me. They don't care about truth. They don't care about human beings. This is labor. That means communist member of parliament and chronic left puncher.
[49:05.300 --> 49:20.300]  Those are terms they use in Britain. So a pusher of leftist things. Jess Phillips appeared on Channel 4 to talk about how devastating she was about the news and the exit polls that it was the biggest loss of labor ever in modern history.
[49:20.300 --> 49:31.300]  They've got a whole bunch of parties. And so it's usually alliances with the conservatives or the Tories as they're called with the left. They're globalist.
[49:31.300 --> 49:45.300]  They won by 50 plus points way past the final polls are out now at 30 something percent for labor. So they have a majority.
[49:45.300 --> 49:55.300]  Not an alliance for an majority. The first time in a long time the conservatives have actual power. It's a big deal.
[49:55.300 --> 50:03.300]  Even the BBC calls it a heavy labor defeat. So she's laughing. She's joking. She's a sociopath in my view. She doesn't care.
[50:03.300 --> 50:10.300]  But then she doesn't know she's live. So she starts tearing up and getting sad, getting into character.
[50:10.300 --> 50:21.300]  And the whole Internet blew up with this thing. And again, it's just one more little straw on the camel's back. But it's everywhere.
[50:21.300 --> 50:29.300]  And people see it now. And so why is coming? Oh, see, Trump wasn't spot on the report says that everybody goes, it says in the report he was spied on.
[50:29.300 --> 50:39.300]  Oh, yeah, you're right. He was. It doesn't work anymore. People aren't asleep anymore. It only angers us.
[50:39.300 --> 50:44.300]  You think when a woman goes out the shooting range with her husband and puts a photo up her shooting a legal gun on Facebook and Facebook says,
[50:44.300 --> 50:56.300]  watch out or we'll ban you. You think that makes the woman go, oh, OK, Facebook, I'll do what you say. No, it pisses them off and makes them get even more active.
[50:56.300 --> 51:06.300]  So they've taken our acquiescence as weakness. We were sleeping. But here she is. They go to her. She doesn't even know she's on camera.
[51:06.300 --> 51:13.300]  She doesn't know she's live and she figures it out. And then the host tried to cover it up and make a joke out of it, making it even worse.
[51:13.300 --> 51:25.300]  These are the people lecturing the Brits and lecturing everybody in the UK that you've taken on more than anybody in Europe and most of them are on welfare and stab you and hate you and kidnap your daughters.
[51:25.300 --> 51:32.300]  And how dare you want don't want record more levels from Sadiq Khan, your Islamic Lord. How dare you.
[51:32.300 --> 51:40.300]  So their own people turned against them one third of the party at least left them.
[51:40.300 --> 51:46.300]  Because it's about survival. They made it racial. The left made it racial and said white people are bad.
[51:46.300 --> 51:56.300]  And so all these white people have been totally open and I said, well, then go to hell. I'm done with you.
[51:56.300 --> 52:03.300]  Europe has been Christian. That's why it opened its doors to people that want to assimilate, not to people that want to come with their sword of Allah.
[52:03.300 --> 52:12.300]  The cancer that that's Islam's real name cancer also known as Islam that takes over everywhere it comes. Stay in your own heavenly wonderland over there.
[52:12.300 --> 52:21.300]  If it's so good, don't come here and try to chop my daughter's genitals off.
[52:21.300 --> 52:26.300]  So they wanted to complete the political correctness and the domination of everybody and it backfired.
[52:26.300 --> 52:35.300]  So here she is laughing, giggling. She doesn't give a damn about anybody. All she cares is she's still in power.
[52:35.300 --> 52:45.300]  And then she sees the camera and has got to act sad. Here's the third grade level drama class captain hook level acting. Here it is.
[52:45.300 --> 52:54.300]  Good evening, Jess. How are you feeling as these results unfold?
[52:54.300 --> 52:58.300]  Can you hear me, Jess?
[52:58.300 --> 53:01.300]  I can hear you. Sorry.
[53:01.300 --> 53:09.300]  Straight face. Actually, you don't have to have a straight face on this show.
[53:09.300 --> 53:17.300]  Go click back in 10 seconds. So you've got this lovingly slob at.
[53:17.300 --> 53:25.300]  And this is what a trader looks like just a goofy doesn't care sell out to the globalist. She doesn't care one way or the other.
[53:25.300 --> 53:29.300]  She's still going to have her job.
[53:29.300 --> 53:34.300]  Her party has just been destroyed.
[53:34.300 --> 53:39.300]  She doesn't believe any of this. She's a mercenary. Continue.
[53:39.300 --> 53:47.300]  Straight face. Actually, you don't have to have a straight face on this show. What are you thinking?
[53:47.300 --> 53:51.300]  Are you talking to me now? That wasn't clear.
[53:51.300 --> 54:00.300]  So I'm really tired. What I'm thinking is this is totally devastating, isn't it?
[54:00.300 --> 54:04.300]  It's totally devastating.
[54:04.300 --> 54:12.300]  We bring in 10 million Islamists and they kidnap tens of thousands of girls a year and sometimes cut them up and feed them his kebabs to us.
[54:12.300 --> 54:20.300]  We kiss their butt and lick their booties and now everyone doesn't want to totally be killed.
[54:20.300 --> 54:28.300]  I love Sadiq Khan. I think he's handsome.
[54:28.300 --> 54:33.300]  All a bunch of lazy, stupid slobs advertising the world.
[54:33.300 --> 54:40.300]  Hey, come here. Get free stuff. We'll manage you and we could screw over white people because white people are inherently bad.
[54:40.300 --> 54:51.300]  And then you are shocked that your own real liberals turn against you because you're a danger. You're a scumbag.
[54:51.300 --> 54:57.300]  And what you are is finished if people stay awake and keep taking action.
[54:57.300 --> 55:05.300]  You know, I know Trump has let them censor everybody because he knows it's just pissing everybody off.
[55:05.300 --> 55:13.300]  But it doesn't matter because it's Trump's job to stop the damn censorship.
[55:13.300 --> 55:16.300]  But at the end of the day, it's our job to make sure.
[55:16.300 --> 55:22.300]  What did they say on CNN last week? They had a guesthouse on. We talked about a neocon.
[55:22.300 --> 55:28.300]  He also tweeted out saying we need to arrest parents that don't vaccinate.
[55:28.300 --> 55:32.300]  We need to take their property and take their children and put them.
[55:32.300 --> 55:36.300]  He said in reeducation camps, he used the Soviet term.
[55:36.300 --> 55:39.300]  Unproven, untested liability protected.
[55:39.300 --> 55:46.300]  Big pharma corruption wants to put hundreds of things in our bodies and we're not supposed to be able to ask a question.
[55:46.300 --> 55:53.300]  And he said, very telling in his tweets and on TV, he said the anti-vaxxers that we thank God banned off the Internet.
[55:53.300 --> 55:59.300]  They're now showing up at public events and taking things over at city councils and Congress and live events.
[55:59.300 --> 56:04.300]  And my God, arrest them. What did you think they do?
[56:04.300 --> 56:09.300]  When they saw their 18 month old son who was talking and having fun and having a great life, never talk again.
[56:09.300 --> 56:15.300]  And they're changing his diapers when he's 10 years old and they've got all the real studies showing it was in the vaccines.
[56:15.300 --> 56:20.300]  And then you sit up there and try to silence them. They're going to come for you, buddy.
[56:20.300 --> 56:24.300]  And you're the one talking about violence, taking people's kids and putting us in camps.
[56:24.300 --> 56:29.300]  You totally banned people going in public talking about it. It's going to be you, buddy.
[56:29.300 --> 56:35.300]  It's going to be you that gets taken care of, guaranteed.
[56:35.300 --> 56:41.300]  I mean, when you start talking like that, people start taking the gloves off.
[56:41.300 --> 56:46.300]  People start just really getting a desire in their heart to protect children.
[56:46.300 --> 56:54.300]  And it's you running your fat, stinking mouth maggot.
[56:54.300 --> 56:57.300]  You left us begging for it.
[56:57.300 --> 57:01.300]  But you know what? We'll let you keep pushing a little longer.
[57:01.300 --> 57:08.300]  You got a little gondy, gondy-esque part of it on the back end.
[57:08.300 --> 57:15.300]  You're going to be swinging from the end of ropes and you know it because your crimes are all coming out.

[1:00:39.300 --> 1:00:43.300]  Thanks to your support. Here it is.
[1:00:43.300 --> 1:00:46.300]  Congressman Al Green. How are you today, man?
[1:00:46.300 --> 1:00:47.300]  Better than I deserve.
[1:00:47.300 --> 1:00:49.300]  Do you remember me?
[1:00:49.300 --> 1:00:50.300]  I think we met over here.
[1:00:50.300 --> 1:00:53.300]  Yeah, oh my gosh. I'm actually really honored you remember me.
[1:00:53.300 --> 1:00:55.300]  I saw what you said on Friday.
[1:00:55.300 --> 1:00:57.300]  I don't know what I said on Friday. I said a lot.
[1:00:57.300 --> 1:00:59.300]  You called the president a racist again.
[1:00:59.300 --> 1:01:02.300]  And you were projecting your race baiting onto him again.
[1:01:02.300 --> 1:01:06.300]  Well, you know you have your opinion and I have mine.
[1:01:06.300 --> 1:01:08.300]  But that's a serious allegation, Al.
[1:01:08.300 --> 1:01:09.300]  Well?
[1:01:09.300 --> 1:01:12.300]  Al, he's not a racist. Here's what I want to say.
[1:01:12.300 --> 1:01:13.300]  Are you a racist?
[1:01:13.300 --> 1:01:14.300]  No, obviously you're not a racist.
[1:01:14.300 --> 1:01:15.300]  Are you a racist?
[1:01:15.300 --> 1:01:16.300]  It is obvious to me.
[1:01:16.300 --> 1:01:18.300]  You're calling me a racist, huh?
[1:01:18.300 --> 1:01:20.300]  That is absurd, Al.
[1:01:20.300 --> 1:01:23.300]  Let me introduce you to a racist who follows me around.
[1:01:23.300 --> 1:01:27.300]  Yeah, I support President Trump like I'm sure many people here do.
[1:01:27.300 --> 1:01:29.300]  Here's how the committee will proceed for this hearing.
[1:01:29.300 --> 1:01:33.300]  I will make an opening statement and then I will recognize the ranking member
[1:01:33.300 --> 1:01:35.300]  for an opening statement.
[1:01:35.300 --> 1:01:38.300]  After that, we will hear two sets of presentations.
[1:01:38.300 --> 1:01:43.300]  We will hear 30-minute breeze opening arguments from councils for the majority
[1:01:43.300 --> 1:01:45.300]  and the minority of this committee.
[1:01:45.300 --> 1:01:57.300]  Jerry Nadler and the Democrat Party are committing treason against this country.
[1:01:57.300 --> 1:02:00.300]  And you can kick me out, but he's the one committing crimes.
[1:02:00.300 --> 1:02:03.300]  You are, Jerry Nadler. You're the one committing treason.
[1:02:03.300 --> 1:02:08.300]  America's done with this. America's sent to the trees and committed by a Democrat Party.
[1:02:08.300 --> 1:02:11.300]  They're not going to sit here and watch them running in peace.
[1:02:11.300 --> 1:02:13.300]  They'll remove our vote.
[1:02:13.300 --> 1:02:15.300]  We voted for Donald Trump.
[1:02:15.300 --> 1:02:17.300]  And they're simply removing it because they don't like it.
[1:02:17.300 --> 1:02:19.300]  America's sent to the impeachment channel.
[1:02:19.300 --> 1:02:22.300]  They're sick of the Democrat treason.
[1:02:22.300 --> 1:02:24.300]  We know he committed a crime, but it wasn't Trump.
[1:02:24.300 --> 1:02:26.300]  Trump is innocent.
[1:02:26.300 --> 1:02:33.300]  The committee will come to order.
[1:02:33.300 --> 1:02:41.300]  Obviously, I shouldn't have to remind everyone present that the audience is here to observe,
[1:02:41.300 --> 1:02:46.300]  but not to demonstrate, not to indicate agreement or disagreement with any witness
[1:02:46.300 --> 1:02:48.300]  or with any member of the committee.
[1:02:48.300 --> 1:02:57.300]  There was not enough, uh, the content kind of wrapped up when you guys kind of got completely wiped off the stage when nobody paid it.
[1:02:57.300 --> 1:02:58.300]  Oh, really? Because your show got canceled, my show's still on the air.
[1:02:58.300 --> 1:03:01.300]  You had a cable network behind you and failed, and now we're shooting a documentary no one cares about
[1:03:01.300 --> 1:03:03.300]  and trying to make fun of me.
[1:03:03.300 --> 1:03:05.300]  I was in Congress yesterday changing the world.
[1:03:05.300 --> 1:03:06.300]  Yesterday.
[1:03:06.300 --> 1:03:11.300]  Jerry Nadler and the Democrat Party are committing treason against this country.
[1:03:11.300 --> 1:03:14.300]  And you can kick me out, but he's the one committing crimes.
[1:03:14.300 --> 1:03:17.300]  You are, Jerry Nadler. You're the one committing treason.
[1:03:17.300 --> 1:03:19.300]  America's done with this.
[1:03:19.300 --> 1:03:21.300]  That's right. I did see that.
[1:03:21.300 --> 1:03:24.300]  I think that was the taxpayer dollars at work.
[1:03:24.300 --> 1:03:28.300]  Do you support the impeachment?
[1:03:28.300 --> 1:03:31.300]  Is there an impeachment going on?
[1:03:31.300 --> 1:03:36.300]  He doesn't want to talk to Info Wars.
[1:03:36.300 --> 1:03:41.300]  He just tries to make fun of Info Wars for a couple months on Comedy Central and fails,
[1:03:41.300 --> 1:03:44.300]  and then he runs away as soon as Info Wars puts a mic in his face.
[1:03:44.300 --> 1:03:47.300]  Aw. I thought you weren't allowed.
[1:03:47.300 --> 1:03:49.300]  I thought you weren't allowed in here.
[1:03:49.300 --> 1:03:50.300]  You're not allowed in here.
[1:03:50.300 --> 1:03:51.300]  I thought you weren't allowed in here.
[1:03:51.300 --> 1:03:56.300]  Look at these Larpers pretending to fight Nazis.
[1:03:56.300 --> 1:03:58.300]  Get that out of my face!
[1:03:58.300 --> 1:04:00.300]  Get out of here!
[1:04:00.300 --> 1:04:02.300]  Get out of here!
[1:04:02.300 --> 1:04:04.300]  Get that out of my face!
[1:04:04.300 --> 1:04:14.300]  Get that out of my face!
[1:04:14.300 --> 1:04:39.300]  Get that out of my face!
[1:04:39.300 --> 1:04:42.300]  There he is right there, what'd I tell ya?
[1:04:42.300 --> 1:04:44.300]  Democrats are real easy to...
[1:04:44.300 --> 1:04:47.300]  By the way, one of those bike riders tried to slit the tires.
[1:04:47.300 --> 1:04:52.300]  That's how violent they also hit him with a bottle.
[1:04:52.300 --> 1:04:54.300]  It cracked on the side of the truck and hit him in the arm.
[1:04:54.300 --> 1:05:13.300]  The globalists think America is done, the globalists think that the West is done, they think that Christians are done and finished.
[1:05:13.300 --> 1:05:20.300]  They believe that if they can demonize and shut down Info Wars that they rightfully see as a symbol, a beacon of populism and freedom,
[1:05:20.300 --> 1:05:24.300]  not just to America, but to the whole world, that they can demoralize everybody else and win.
[1:05:24.300 --> 1:05:25.300]  Why?
[1:05:25.300 --> 1:05:27.300]  If they can shut Info Wars down, they can intimidate everybody else.
[1:05:27.300 --> 1:05:31.300]  That's why it's beyond critical that you keep Info Wars on the air.
[1:05:31.300 --> 1:05:35.300]  It's only by your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support that we're on air.
[1:05:35.300 --> 1:05:38.300]  And I want to thank you all this Christmas for your past support,
[1:05:38.300 --> 1:05:44.300]  but I want to encourage you now to redouble your efforts and financially support us by getting great products you need
[1:05:44.300 --> 1:05:46.300]  during the 12 days of Christmas and infowarstore.com.
[1:05:46.300 --> 1:05:53.300]  Massive sales, store-wide free shipping, double-patria points, infowarstore.com.
[1:05:53.300 --> 1:06:19.300]  Please take action now. George Soros hopes you don't.
[1:06:19.300 --> 1:06:36.300]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and it is Tuesday, December 17th, 2019. I'm your host.
[1:06:36.300 --> 1:06:40.300]  I want to go to your phone calls, but I want to hit this big piece of news first.
[1:06:40.300 --> 1:06:49.300]  Multinational corporations have taken over major governments,
[1:06:49.300 --> 1:06:51.300]  and they are dissolving the sovereignty of the people.
[1:06:51.300 --> 1:06:56.300]  They are transferring the jobs and tax money to multinational corporations
[1:06:56.300 --> 1:07:09.300]  and dictatorships like Communist China that they control.
[1:07:09.300 --> 1:07:16.300]  They then open the borders up and flood the population that's left, the indigenous population,
[1:07:16.300 --> 1:07:22.300]  with third-world and Islamic populations that have been taught to hate the countries they're entering
[1:07:22.300 --> 1:07:27.300]  and that have been taught that they are a political group coming here to conquer
[1:07:27.300 --> 1:07:31.300]  and with the racial ethos that white people are bad.
[1:07:31.300 --> 1:07:37.300]  This is a 100% takeover plan by the globalists, and I know you know that.
[1:07:37.300 --> 1:07:44.300]  That doesn't mean people with brown skin are bad. We're not the left teaching racism and collectivism.
[1:07:44.300 --> 1:07:49.300]  This is what the UN is doing, and people are backlashing against it everywhere,
[1:07:49.300 --> 1:07:54.300]  including people that are citizens of Europe and citizens of the United States who are not white.
[1:07:54.300 --> 1:08:00.300]  And some of the numbers, they're the group highest level of numbers that doesn't want to be in a race-based system.
[1:08:00.300 --> 1:08:04.300]  Why would you want to live like that?
[1:08:04.300 --> 1:08:08.300]  Here's some of the articles. This is from Deutsche Welle. That's the big news over in Germany.
[1:08:08.300 --> 1:08:11.300]  This is not our headline. This is the UN.
[1:08:11.300 --> 1:08:15.300]  UN demands countries take more refugees, more migrants.
[1:08:15.300 --> 1:08:21.300]  Globalist hailed Germany as frontrunner in refugee protection.
[1:08:21.300 --> 1:08:27.300]  The UN has described rising numbers of people fleeing their homes,
[1:08:27.300 --> 1:08:35.300]  meaning more must be done to shoulder the responsibility of the Islamic population
[1:08:35.300 --> 1:08:42.300]  that was 500 million people just 40 years ago.
[1:08:42.300 --> 1:08:46.300]  It's now 1.8 billion.
[1:08:46.300 --> 1:08:50.300]  It's going to be 3 billion in 10 years.
[1:08:50.300 --> 1:08:56.300]  And they all believe they have a right to come here and conquer us, and they're alive with the left.
[1:08:56.300 --> 1:09:01.300]  That's why the UN says they want 600 million migrants into the United States the next 25 years.
[1:09:01.300 --> 1:09:05.300]  Same thing with Europe, 250 million. Those are real statements. Pull them up.
[1:09:05.300 --> 1:09:07.300]  They call it replacement migration.
[1:09:07.300 --> 1:09:13.300]  Oh, but Sasha Barrett Cohen says that if you say that, it doesn't exist,
[1:09:13.300 --> 1:09:16.300]  even though it's on the UN website and official.
[1:09:16.300 --> 1:09:20.300]  No borders, no walls, no Europe or USA at all.
[1:09:20.300 --> 1:09:24.300]  UN demands countries take more migrants.
[1:09:24.300 --> 1:09:31.300]  And you can read the quotes, reboot the system, bring in more.
[1:09:31.300 --> 1:09:33.300]  It's all there with the videos.
[1:09:33.300 --> 1:09:35.300]  And that ties into this video that I'm going to your calls.
[1:09:35.300 --> 1:09:39.300]  Jamie White wrote it. It's on infowars.com and newswars.com.
[1:09:39.300 --> 1:09:44.300]  Illegal aliens pack New York DMV after state allows driver's license for all,
[1:09:44.300 --> 1:09:46.300]  and then you can vote with those.
[1:09:46.300 --> 1:09:49.300]  Remember, they always said we're not going to let illegals vote,
[1:09:49.300 --> 1:09:58.300]  in a bunch of states they've passed laws letting them do it and so have cities like Chicago and San Francisco.
[1:09:58.300 --> 1:10:04.300]  Now again, can I go to Mexico and get a driver's license? Hell no.
[1:10:04.300 --> 1:10:09.300]  They laugh at you.
[1:10:09.300 --> 1:10:11.300]  Think about that.
[1:10:11.300 --> 1:10:15.300]  Nobody would anywhere, but this is how you break a country.
[1:10:15.300 --> 1:10:18.300]  This is how you destroy a nation.
[1:10:18.300 --> 1:10:22.300]  If you're a radio listener, you've got to see this video at infowars.com.
[1:10:22.300 --> 1:10:26.300]  And that's the first day.
[1:10:26.300 --> 1:10:30.300]  Think your truck driving, pay is going to go down or up with this.
[1:10:30.300 --> 1:10:32.300]  It's going to go down, down, down.
[1:10:32.300 --> 1:10:37.300]  Like Ross Perot said, you import the third world without building the third world up, you become it.
[1:10:37.300 --> 1:10:39.300]  The giant sucking sound.
[1:10:39.300 --> 1:10:41.300]  And China is the bottom of the drain.
[1:10:41.300 --> 1:10:45.300]  No environmental standards, slave labor, hell on earth.
[1:10:45.300 --> 1:11:00.300]  Illegal aliens pack New York DMV after state allows driver's license for all.
[1:11:00.300 --> 1:11:03.300]  Incredible.
[1:11:03.300 --> 1:11:08.300]  But remember, they gave welfare, Obamacare, to all the illegals.
[1:11:08.300 --> 1:11:10.300]  Remember, Obama said it was a lie though.
[1:11:10.300 --> 1:11:14.300]  Oh, we're not going to do that, even though it was in the bill.
[1:11:14.300 --> 1:11:19.300]  And that's to get all the unskilled people here.
[1:11:19.300 --> 1:11:24.300]  Who are then taught to hate America, which is the globalist takeover plan.
[1:11:24.300 --> 1:11:33.300]  Beau, Josh, Thomas, Koi, Charlie, Angel, JK, Josh, we want all of you.
[1:11:33.300 --> 1:11:37.300]  Let's go to Angel in Texas here on the air. Thanks for calling.
[1:11:37.300 --> 1:11:38.300]  Hi, Alex. Can you hear me?
[1:11:38.300 --> 1:11:40.300]  I can. Thanks for calling.
[1:11:40.300 --> 1:11:41.300]  Awesome. Thanks.
[1:11:41.300 --> 1:11:44.300]  First, I wanted to give a shout out to some of your products.
[1:11:44.300 --> 1:11:49.300]  We buy the coffee, the living defense, the regularize basically all the gut health products.
[1:11:49.300 --> 1:11:53.300]  And also the turbo force is amazing. So thank you for the product.
[1:11:53.300 --> 1:11:54.300]  Thank you.
[1:11:54.300 --> 1:12:04.300]  Of course, I wanted to bring up the point about maybe where they go where the left goes from here with the impeachment falling apart.
[1:12:04.300 --> 1:12:05.300]  I'd love to get your take on it.
[1:12:05.300 --> 1:12:10.300]  Yeah, what are they going to do now that national polls show that are even skewed against Trump that it's totally blown up in their face.
[1:12:10.300 --> 1:12:13.300]  What hour are they going to strike back?
[1:12:13.300 --> 1:12:25.300]  I think actually is this whole impeachment thing from the beginning might be like a tactic that they're using just to sell more political defense just to divide us even further.
[1:12:25.300 --> 1:12:27.300]  Because I really think that that's the end goal.
[1:12:27.300 --> 1:12:31.300]  I don't necessarily think that their end goal is to impeach Trump.
[1:12:31.300 --> 1:12:34.300]  It's just to completely divide this nation.
[1:12:34.300 --> 1:12:44.300]  So that way we're arguing all the time while we're arguing. No one is even noticing, you know, in the mainstream or whatever what they're doing to take over with big tech.
[1:12:44.300 --> 1:12:52.300]  So essentially, I would, you know, characterize it as like when you're playing a board game with someone and they get caught cheating.
[1:12:52.300 --> 1:12:55.300]  So they flip the whole table.
[1:12:55.300 --> 1:12:57.300]  That's exactly what's happening.
[1:12:57.300 --> 1:13:02.300]  They want to change the subject from all the crimes they've committed look good to their base, further divide the nation.
[1:13:02.300 --> 1:13:04.300]  But they'd already divided it so much.
[1:13:04.300 --> 1:13:16.300]  The question was how much more divided could it get just like one third of the leftist liberals now voted conservative for the first time ever destroying the dominant party.
[1:13:16.300 --> 1:13:20.300]  A total realignment that's ongoing.
[1:13:20.300 --> 1:13:26.300]  This is creating unity now because everybody sees this and sees as a kangaroo court and sees Trump's done nothing.
[1:13:26.300 --> 1:13:32.300]  He's in trouble for investigating corruption. And they all saw what Joe Biden said about, you know, screw everybody.
[1:13:32.300 --> 1:13:36.300]  I'm going to do whatever I want, fire the prosecutor and they fired him in one hour.
[1:13:36.300 --> 1:13:39.300]  So absolutely, that's what's happened.
[1:13:39.300 --> 1:13:46.300]  So it's creating unity now and it's backfiring against them and making Trump the anti-corruption guy that he promised to be.
[1:13:46.300 --> 1:13:48.300]  Now he's being seen as that.
[1:13:48.300 --> 1:13:52.300]  The Democrats thought they could do this and I don't think it's working. In fact, we know it's not.
[1:13:52.300 --> 1:13:56.300]  So what do they do next is the question?
[1:13:56.300 --> 1:14:05.300]  I mean, honestly, they have so many tricks in their back, but I mean, I wouldn't be surprised to see like a horrible major false flag event.
[1:14:05.300 --> 1:14:17.300]  You know, because like Paul Joseph Watson yesterday was saying that in the UK, you know, they're already kind of, I guess, implying that they might they might move to a martial law.
[1:14:17.300 --> 1:14:23.300]  So, you know, basically, if they could get like a huge event, maybe like 9-11 or maybe not that big, who knows.
[1:14:23.300 --> 1:14:31.300]  But, you know, they could assure in, I guess, their version of martial law and try to take over that way.
[1:14:31.300 --> 1:14:34.300]  I just think, you know, at this point, everything they've tried has failed.
[1:14:34.300 --> 1:14:43.300]  So they're in the death row and so they're desperate. God only knows, you know, what they have planned for us.
[1:14:43.300 --> 1:14:51.300]  You're absolutely right about everything you said and I'm begging you to have real respect for your understanding and the fact that you even listen to the show.
[1:14:51.300 --> 1:14:55.300]  And I'm begging all the listeners to do that because you're all very humble people. I am as well.
[1:14:55.300 --> 1:15:07.300]  We have a job, though, to warn people, whether it's a pregnant woman about the dangers of vaccines or whether it is a family, you know, buying GMO crap or whether your town has fluoride in it.
[1:15:07.300 --> 1:15:12.300]  It's our job to expose this and to not go along with it. God bless you and I appreciate your call.
[1:15:12.300 --> 1:15:18.300]  All right, we're going to go to break and we're going to hurry through these calls. Josh and others, JK, all of you are straight ahead.
[1:15:18.300 --> 1:15:22.300]  Please don't forget, you heard her talk about the products. They really are great products.
[1:15:22.300 --> 1:15:31.300]  The 12 days of Christmas are going right now and they compound. Something else is on sale every day, but that adds everything else that was on sale.

[1:16:06.300 --> 1:16:14.300]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[1:16:14.300 --> 1:16:22.300]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[1:16:22.300 --> 1:16:33.300]  On a security IPO or note, blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each month.

[1:17:15.300 --> 1:17:18.300]  Can you give us an example of somebody you help?
[1:17:18.300 --> 1:17:30.300]  Can I ever? We have taken a $500,000 liability with the IRS. Guess what? The client didn't pay a dime through the representation known as non-collectible status with the government.

[1:19:31.300 --> 1:19:37.300]  So, again, it says Christmas lights are a lot like Epstein that these things don't hang themselves on the front.
[1:19:37.300 --> 1:19:47.300]  On the back, it's got infowars.com and shows the O in infowars as a wreath. It's also a noose. The system can't stand it when you promote things at the grassroots level.
[1:19:47.300 --> 1:19:51.300]  They can't stand it when you fund independent pro-America, pro-human media.
[1:19:51.300 --> 1:20:17.300]  That's why you've got to take advantage of this shirt and get it today at infowarshore.com.
[1:20:17.300 --> 1:20:28.300]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[1:20:28.300 --> 1:20:42.300]  We are close to victory. The Democrats just can't help themselves as they control the house, but it's, it's going to turn into just a total death blow and a giant presentation of their criminal activity.
[1:20:42.300 --> 1:20:50.300]  How are they going to strike back? Josh, in Florida. Thanks for calling. What's your take on the situation?
[1:20:50.300 --> 1:20:54.300]  Hey, what's going on, Alex? Thanks for finally talking to you.
[1:20:54.300 --> 1:21:00.300]  I've been listening to you since that martial law video where you had that interview with David Durgan.
[1:21:00.300 --> 1:21:13.300]  It's a classic. And I love the product, bone broth. Put that in a blender with some ice, a banana, and a scoop of the vitamin mineral fusion. It's excellent. So thanks very much for that.
[1:21:13.300 --> 1:21:18.300]  Thank you. Yeah, I have so much less joint pain now that I'm taking the bodies and the bone broth.
[1:21:18.300 --> 1:21:23.300]  And because it's just, mother nature has amazing things. Sorry, go ahead.
[1:21:23.300 --> 1:21:35.300]  Yes. But I think the left overplayed how idiotic their followers were. And I think they've reached their apex of division.
[1:21:35.300 --> 1:21:49.300]  So if I was them, if they spent all this time and energy that they did with the Russia gate and impeachment, they might actually have a candidate worth putting up there, but they don't.
[1:21:49.300 --> 1:22:03.300]  So in my opinion, I think we're going to see more of their idiots followers doing things, maybe more shootings, blaming it on the right.
[1:22:03.300 --> 1:22:12.300]  But if I was a general, a good general knows when to retreat. And I really think they should.
[1:22:12.300 --> 1:22:22.300]  If I was them, I would back up and make till 2024 and really try to reorganize what the heck they're doing because it's a joke.
[1:22:22.300 --> 1:22:34.300]  I could talk to anybody. I'm mixed. My dad's from Pakistan. My mom's Irish English. So I can get away with I go up to these people and they don't know how to respond to me because I'm brown.
[1:22:34.300 --> 1:22:47.300]  And when I go out and wear my Trump stuff, these people are like, they look at me like, like I'm from another planet and they have no words because here's a brown guy with a beard telling you all these facts.
[1:22:47.300 --> 1:22:53.300]  And because I'm not white, they can't say, oh, you're a racist. I mean, I'm white, but I don't, they don't.
[1:22:53.300 --> 1:23:00.300]  Well, that's beautiful. Exactly. We need the ethos of wanting to be Americans. Then that unifies us. And that's how we get stronger.
[1:23:00.300 --> 1:23:08.300]  And then our diversity does make us strong. But the globalists use diversity to have us all divided into subgroups, self-segregating and then saying America is inherently bad.
[1:23:08.300 --> 1:23:18.300]  But the way you said it is actually scientific and mathematic and dead on the apex or the summit, ladies and gentlemen, the paramount point, not penultimate.
[1:23:18.300 --> 1:23:30.300]  That's the next top. But the apex point of division has been reached with this whole latest fiasco with vitamin and all the rest of it.
[1:23:30.300 --> 1:23:38.300]  And so they've gotten to the top of the mountain of their division and they're now going down. Now, they're so arrogant, they may think they can try to go up again to a new summit,
[1:23:38.300 --> 1:23:45.300]  but I just don't see it happening unless they have huge false flags and can carry it off and people buy it.
[1:23:45.300 --> 1:23:49.300]  The problem is they don't have full control of the government right now, so they know that they're going to get caught in the false flag.
[1:23:49.300 --> 1:23:53.300]  That's why they're pulling off all this fake whistleblower, vitamin, wimpy stuff.
[1:23:53.300 --> 1:24:01.300]  But don't think a foreign power might not pull something off just to create a civil war in this country. So that's the real danger.
[1:24:01.300 --> 1:24:07.300]  I seriously don't think we're out of the woods yet, but good things are happening. What do you say, Josh?
[1:24:07.300 --> 1:24:23.300]  I agree 100%. I hope they don't take my advice, but they should go back into the shadows and reformulate their plan and start planning for 2024 because it's just a big joke now.
[1:24:23.300 --> 1:24:30.300]  Or they need to turn completely socialist and to start putting their cards on the table and let everybody know what they're about.
[1:24:30.300 --> 1:24:37.300]  And if they're going to be, you know, hopefully they'll be at the front lines of the civil war that they start, which I doubt.
[1:24:37.300 --> 1:24:45.300]  And that would be the question I would want to ask if I was in D.C. Are you going to take responsibility for starting a civil war?
[1:24:45.300 --> 1:24:49.300]  Beautifully said. Beautifully said, JK. Thank you so much.
[1:24:49.300 --> 1:24:58.300]  All right. Beautifully said, Josh. Now we're going to go to JK in Washington. JK in Washington, you're on the air. Thank you. Go ahead.
[1:24:58.300 --> 1:25:07.300]  Yeah, Alex. So I wanted to say about your products also. I know people are talking about so I'll make it quick. The knockout is fantastic.
[1:25:07.300 --> 1:25:19.300]  It's worked for, I've given it to people lefties on the right. It's worked for everybody. So I highly recommend knockout. You developed that, didn't you? That formula?
[1:25:19.300 --> 1:25:26.300]  I'm sorry, sir. I've got a new wireless headset and it cut out the last two seconds. Say that again.
[1:25:26.300 --> 1:25:31.300]  I was saying about knockout and you developed that formula, right? Yes, I did.
[1:25:31.300 --> 1:25:38.300]  Yeah, you actually, the only thing I would say, be careful. It works so well that sometimes you're groggy when you wake up, even though we always are.
[1:25:38.300 --> 1:25:42.300]  But it works for like eight hours. So definitely take it eight hours before you want to get up.
[1:25:42.300 --> 1:25:46.300]  Well, let me tell you how I developed it. I said, that's awesome.
[1:25:46.300 --> 1:26:01.300]  I mean, I was sitting there and my girlfriend was over as I was in a divorce. This is like six years ago and I'm sitting there and she's like, here, you'll sleep better because I was all nervous and stressed out and things if you take melatonin.
[1:26:01.300 --> 1:26:06.300]  And she said, I've also got some valerian written. I've got this and I said, wow, that's like 20 bucks. That's like 30 bucks.
[1:26:06.300 --> 1:26:15.300]  And then I went and talked to developers and I said, how much does melatonin really cost? How much does a valerian really cost? How much does good organic sources of eight known things?
[1:26:15.300 --> 1:26:26.300]  And they were all very inexpensive. So I said, I can sell this retail for like, you know, $29.95, always discounted at $19.95 and still make like $10 a bottle.
[1:26:26.300 --> 1:26:32.300]  When a normal bottle of melatonin is like 15 bucks, it might have a dollar product in it. Some of the other stuff costs more.
[1:26:32.300 --> 1:26:38.300]  But then I went to medical people and experts and I said, are all these things safe together?
[1:26:38.300 --> 1:26:46.300]  And they said, yeah, absolutely. They all synergistically work together. And because it's all organic, though, some batches are stronger than other batches.
[1:26:46.300 --> 1:26:53.300]  So sometimes knock out super strong. This last batch, we're getting a lot of calls are like, whoa, this is really strong. A batch before that was okay.
[1:26:53.300 --> 1:27:02.300]  But I mean, yes, Randall Wilhites writes the Texas Family Code. I mean, literally every year his name is on the Texas Family Code book.
[1:27:02.300 --> 1:27:10.300]  And he's a really smart guy, doesn't drink, doesn't smoke, exercises. But he stayed up so many years, not sleeping for court cases.
[1:27:10.300 --> 1:27:17.300]  He's worked for Racehorse Haines, the most famous criminal lawyer. And so he trained his brain out to sleep.
[1:27:17.300 --> 1:27:22.300]  Well, he's even taken medications, couldn't sleep. And he's talked about knockout helped him more than anything he's ever taken.
[1:27:22.300 --> 1:27:29.300]  So yes, it's an amazing thing. And I just thought, why not put everything that works together in one pill and not overcharge people?
[1:27:29.300 --> 1:27:36.300]  That's why knockouts so popular. But I'm ranting about the product. Thanks for the support. What is your point about Deep State's next move, JK?
[1:27:36.300 --> 1:27:45.300]  I will, but I just want to say real quick, that's a difference between someone who's sincerely trying to find a solution, as in contrast with a corporation,
[1:27:45.300 --> 1:27:52.300]  who's trying to figure out how can we get the biggest profit margin. And so hats off to you, Alex, for doing that.
[1:27:52.300 --> 1:27:55.300]  Well, thank you, sir. Well, I mean, I always go at things as how I want to be treated.
[1:27:55.300 --> 1:28:03.300]  But I was also thinking as a model to make money, if I can have it work better than everybody else's and not be expensive, I'm going to dominate the market.
[1:28:03.300 --> 1:28:04.300]  But sorry, go ahead.
[1:28:04.300 --> 1:28:11.300]  But you're a good balance. You're the right balance. You sincerely were looking for a solution. And so many of the other products are looking for the profit margin.
[1:28:11.300 --> 1:28:19.300]  So anyway, I grew up in a deep state neighborhood in the DC area. I didn't know it until about 20 years ago.
[1:28:19.300 --> 1:28:22.300]  I wrote a book about it, written two books.
[1:28:22.300 --> 1:28:29.300]  But then JK hold, I've got my guests coming up next, not this segment, but the next segment. We'll take calls in two.
[1:28:29.300 --> 1:28:38.300]  I want to hear about this. Let's let's let's not put bookends on it yet. Don't don't hang up JK, then Bob, then Julie, then Charlie Coy.
[1:28:38.300 --> 1:28:45.300]  We're going to get to everybody. Bam, bam, bam. We're going to get to everybody in four wars.com, news wars.com, band video.
[1:28:45.300 --> 1:28:53.300]  Remember, the globalist hope you don't spread those articles in those videos because now the big awakening is actually happening.
[1:28:53.300 --> 1:29:16.300]  We've got a strike now.
[1:29:24.300 --> 1:29:28.300]  Hunters, anglers, campers and survivalists, get back to nature.

[1:31:01.300 --> 1:31:04.300]  I don't have to tell you that 2020 is going to be maker to break it.
[1:31:04.300 --> 1:31:07.300]  Not just for Info Wars, not just for America, but the whole world.
[1:31:07.300 --> 1:31:13.300]  We are in a battle between the forces of globalism that want to post-human world and those that want to pro-human world.
[1:31:13.300 --> 1:31:21.300]  We're in a fight between Satan and Christ and it's being played out amongst us mortals, but it's being directed from on high.
[1:31:21.300 --> 1:31:27.300]  And I'm just telling the listeners this broadcast, without you, we're going to lose this fight.
[1:31:27.300 --> 1:31:32.300]  I need all of you to realize how important you are and how important Info Wars is and what we've done together.

[1:32:22.300 --> 1:32:25.300]  And thanks. I'm going to give that person over there a better life.
[1:32:25.300 --> 1:32:31.300]  I'm going to wake up today. You know what? I'm going to spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier and richer.
[1:32:31.300 --> 1:32:33.300]  I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend.
[1:32:33.300 --> 1:32:37.300]  I don't think that happens very often. It's never happened to me. I've never had anyone knock on my door and said,
[1:32:37.300 --> 1:32:40.300]  Tate, you're such a good guy. How can I improve your life in every single way?
[1:32:40.300 --> 1:32:44.300]  There's only one person who woke up and thought that and that was me. I woke up and thought, you know what?
[1:32:44.300 --> 1:32:47.300]  Okay, I want to take control of my life. I want to take control of my health.
[1:32:47.300 --> 1:32:51.300]  And that's why you need to go to infowarstore.com. Take control of your health right now and support the resistance.
[1:32:51.300 --> 1:32:54.300]  Don't buy into the group. Don't drink the Kool-Aid. Drink the turbo force.
[1:32:54.300 --> 1:32:56.300]  Kool-Aid is bad and the turbo force is good.
[1:32:59.300 --> 1:33:02.300]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:02.300 --> 1:33:18.300]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[1:33:18.300 --> 1:33:32.300]  All right, JK is in DC singing grew up in a deep state neighborhood.
[1:33:32.300 --> 1:33:37.300]  For folks that don't know, mafia has neighborhoods, religious groups have neighborhoods,
[1:33:37.300 --> 1:33:41.300]  but the deep state certainly does have neighborhoods.
[1:33:41.300 --> 1:33:46.300]  And so tell us about the books you wrote real quick and give us your take, sir.
[1:33:46.300 --> 1:33:53.300]  Okay, yeah, the books aren't available. I'm still trying to get so that they are mine.
[1:33:53.300 --> 1:33:59.300]  They are mine, but it's complicated. But anyway, it was called the A club. What is an American?
[1:33:59.300 --> 1:34:06.300]  So I wrote about American culture back in 2007, but I used a pen name because I was working for a corporation.
[1:34:06.300 --> 1:34:11.300]  And the other one is also being revamped is about information literacy.
[1:34:11.300 --> 1:34:17.300]  So you can find my name. Well, anyway, I grew up in a deep state neighborhood, but like I said, I didn't know about it.
[1:34:17.300 --> 1:34:26.300]  But just so you know, the context, the context for me is the Bible and specifically the end times as a context for all this that's going on.
[1:34:26.300 --> 1:34:29.300]  So that's where I take things from.
[1:34:29.300 --> 1:34:37.300]  But well, you don't just take things from that. It's happening. World government, Mark of the Beast, Global Cashless Society, it's here.
[1:34:37.300 --> 1:34:42.300]  Yes. So and it absolutely is as to where we are in it, but we're in it.
[1:34:42.300 --> 1:34:49.300]  It's not like your view is humans need oxygen to live or, you know, I mean, that's not your opinion that that's happening.
[1:34:49.300 --> 1:34:51.300]  The sky is blue, as you say. Yeah.
[1:34:51.300 --> 1:34:58.300]  So I'm here to get to cut to it to answer your question. I think the deep state is going to do the bad side of deep state.
[1:34:58.300 --> 1:35:03.300]  See, I know people in the deep state. I know there's good guys also, but that term is more negative.
[1:35:03.300 --> 1:35:18.300]  So I'll just clarify the evil side of the deep state is going to do something new because that we, the people are on to their false flag onto the lying, the propaganda.
[1:35:18.300 --> 1:35:28.300]  Now, the infiltration stuff is still effective where they infiltrate or they go in and act like they're doing something on the, you know, on the good side and they're really on the bad side.
[1:35:28.300 --> 1:35:33.300]  Or they get a job with you and then claim you wear swastika shoes around the office. Yeah, just total lies.
[1:35:33.300 --> 1:35:37.300]  Exactly. No, they're doing that to you. So that's still going to happen.
[1:35:37.300 --> 1:35:43.300]  But God told me, I believe I saw the vision of something new.
[1:35:43.300 --> 1:35:48.300]  So you're smart listeners and you put your heads together and try to figure it out.
[1:35:48.300 --> 1:35:56.300]  And maybe if we figured out, don't say it because sometimes you don't want to let them know, but they're looking for something new.
[1:35:56.300 --> 1:36:02.300]  That's not all those other ways because with the Internet and with, you know, all that things are being exposed.
[1:36:02.300 --> 1:36:07.300]  And you, like you said, just 1776 worldwide, we, the people are awakening.
[1:36:07.300 --> 1:36:12.300]  And so it's going to be something new. They'll still do the infiltration stuff.
[1:36:12.300 --> 1:36:19.300]  Well, sure. If you ask why Trump hasn't come out against vaccines as he earlier did, because Baron got really hurt by it, but bounced back. Thank God.
[1:36:19.300 --> 1:36:29.300]  And Trump doesn't like that talk about that, but that's a fact. I mean, Baron reportedly had to be hospitalized for people that are close to the family, but it was little master's degree in special education.
[1:36:29.300 --> 1:36:35.300]  So I know I worked with all, you know, I'm a retired teacher, but so you see how it's escalating.
[1:36:35.300 --> 1:36:38.300]  I mean, how they're just just more and more children are brain damaged.
[1:36:38.300 --> 1:36:45.300]  But if Trump comes out and says, don't take the vaccines, they're going to then release a bio weapon and say the plague happened because Trump said that.
[1:36:45.300 --> 1:36:51.300]  I mean, that's why he's hemmed in by what they can do on so many fronts, but they want to plunge the economy.
[1:36:51.300 --> 1:36:57.300]  That's what they're going to try to do. And I would say a bio weapon release, something along those lines, a mass shooting in a school.
[1:36:57.300 --> 1:37:03.300]  But that's not really new. You're right. Something new. Thank you. Great points, JK.
[1:37:03.300 --> 1:37:07.300]  All right, let's talk to Julie and Michigan. Julie, thanks for holding. You're on the air.
[1:37:07.300 --> 1:37:09.300]  Hi, Alex. How are you doing?
[1:37:09.300 --> 1:37:16.300]  I'm doing very good. I mean, the globalists are really getting their ass handed to them. It's blowing up with their face very nicely.
[1:37:16.300 --> 1:37:23.300]  But every time I start feeling confident in life politically, that's when I get hit with an uppercut. What do you think?
[1:37:23.300 --> 1:37:26.300]  You can't ever feel too confident.
[1:37:26.300 --> 1:37:27.300]  That's right.
[1:37:27.300 --> 1:37:33.300]  Yeah, absolutely. I think it's very interesting what's going on right now.
[1:37:33.300 --> 1:37:44.300]  And I really feel like the globalists are walking the thin line with the Internet. I mean, on the one hand, you know, they've got their redouts.
[1:37:44.300 --> 1:37:50.300]  On the other hand, they need it to survive, prosper and prevail with the surveillance system.
[1:37:50.300 --> 1:37:54.300]  So what we're up against right now is a double edged sword.
[1:37:54.300 --> 1:38:00.300]  So all we can do is keep praying, keep showing up and keep pressing.
[1:38:00.300 --> 1:38:08.300]  I'm really proud to see all the patriots showing up more now than they have been in the past and speaking up.
[1:38:08.300 --> 1:38:11.300]  I think that's going to make a big difference.
[1:38:11.300 --> 1:38:14.300]  You're right, Julie. There's so many examples now. I can't even get to them all.
[1:38:14.300 --> 1:38:23.300]  And our people are articulate. They get in the front of the line. They're right there. They cut in with decisive info. It's devastating them.
[1:38:23.300 --> 1:38:36.300]  It is. And that's really our only hope because, I mean, anything can happen at any time and a big enough distraction, I think, is what they're going to try to do next.
[1:38:36.300 --> 1:38:48.300]  Kind of, you know, hopefully not anything like 9-11, but I think something that distracts people widely enough on a mental level would be probably their tactic.
[1:38:48.300 --> 1:39:02.300]  But the thing that we need to do is network, find other ways of networking to stay together, stay strong and keep pushing, like, you know, this handing out the driver's licenses in New York.
[1:39:02.300 --> 1:39:09.300]  I don't, you know, I think we should speak up against that and just keep speaking up, basically.
[1:39:09.300 --> 1:39:17.300]  You're right. And I was just thinking about the next level of the awakening and what's going to unfold.
[1:39:17.300 --> 1:39:27.300]  Look at how suddenly these documents come out and these whistleblowers go public, that the Afghan war was always meant to be lost, always meant to control the opium.
[1:39:27.300 --> 1:39:33.300]  Everybody I talk to, whether they're officers or enlisted or against this war, Trump is against it.
[1:39:33.300 --> 1:39:40.300]  Ron Paul calls it the crime of the century. I agree with him. It started with the 21st century. It's 18 and a half years old now.
[1:39:40.300 --> 1:39:54.300]  And the fact that that's coming out and the Saudi connection 9-11 is coming out, all these things more and more is coming out because there are good people in the intelligence agencies in what you call the deep state.
[1:39:54.300 --> 1:39:59.300]  They're just not usually at the top of the power structure. That's changing with Trump.
[1:39:59.300 --> 1:40:12.300]  So they were about to expose the shadow group and we know who it is. It's the same corporation that set up and controlled the loans to the Marshall plan that then controlled the resurrection of Europe.
[1:40:12.300 --> 1:40:19.300]  And that same corporate conglomerate broke away from the U.S. government and has been stealing about half the defense budget every year.
[1:40:19.300 --> 1:40:25.300]  It was multi-trillions back in 2001. That was all coming out. There was a deep state war happening then.
[1:40:25.300 --> 1:40:31.300]  So 9-11 was carried out, working with Islamists as well, not saying Islam is in a threat.
[1:40:31.300 --> 1:40:37.300]  But there was a deep state working with it. That was a staged event to try to get everybody to accept the tyranny and the police state.
[1:40:37.300 --> 1:40:45.300]  But now the police themselves are awake. And so it's quite a time to be alive, Julie. Thank you so much and God bless.
[1:40:45.300 --> 1:40:53.300]  She made some really good points. These callers are amazing. Let's go to Bob in New York. Thanks for holding, sir.
[1:40:53.300 --> 1:40:58.300]  Alex, I love you. I love you.
[1:40:58.300 --> 1:41:04.300]  I'm a man in New York, but I know who I am, but that's the truth. I want to tell you that.
[1:41:04.300 --> 1:41:11.300]  Listen, we have to go on the offensive. First of all, Trump has to go on the offensive and arrest somebody.
[1:41:11.300 --> 1:41:18.300]  Secondly, you have to go on the offensive and have a 10 million man march July 4th in D.C.
[1:41:18.300 --> 1:41:26.300]  Oh, ensure your style. I'm asking you to do it. I'd be there. You get 10 million people out there, and we have to be on the offensive to call the police.
[1:41:26.300 --> 1:41:31.300]  Well, I mean, let's say we get a million people tuned in today. That's very conservative, but a million actually live.
[1:41:31.300 --> 1:41:39.300]  If everybody listening came, that'd be a million people. We need everybody, if we did something like that to spend months promoting it, everybody else,
[1:41:39.300 --> 1:41:45.300]  and it needs to be around the Capitol and around the White House, not at the mall where they send you to not get any coverage.
[1:41:45.300 --> 1:41:56.300]  We need to be there with bullhorns streaming live, and we need to have like a three day event where we're going to go and then go into the halls of Congress legally and lawfully and take our country back.
[1:41:56.300 --> 1:42:02.300]  I agree with you 100%. I think what Owen Schroeder did, we should be doing that every day.
[1:42:02.300 --> 1:42:09.300]  And if we did, then we'd be able to go to Adam Schiff's office and demand the empty his desk in front of us on live television.
[1:42:09.300 --> 1:42:21.300]  I mean, the median that you have going on here is just unbelievable. I mean, I'm listening to a live boardroom discussion with Alex Jones pointing in different things.
[1:42:21.300 --> 1:42:27.300]  I mean, this is how it has to happen. So if we call in and shows like this and talk about solutions, we're going to come up with one.
[1:42:27.300 --> 1:42:35.300]  You know, I believe the first caller who said that they're probably going to go with some 9-11 type thing, maybe not as big. I mean, why not?
[1:42:35.300 --> 1:42:42.300]  You know, they can do that stuff till 3,000 of us just like that and not care. So what's the number?
[1:42:42.300 --> 1:42:51.300]  That's right. Make no mistake. They're getting ready to pull something big and we better figure out what it is and better get out ahead of it, even if they do pull it so we can expose who stood to gain from it.
[1:42:51.300 --> 1:42:55.300]  It's going to be very obvious when they stage it. They're going to blame Trump, blame America.
[1:42:55.300 --> 1:43:07.300]  Christmas is here and it's time to give yourself, your family and your loved ones the gift of having incredible energy, stamina, focus, libido.

[2:57:43.300 --> 2:57:59.300]  My fault, my fear. I thought that you would want what I want. I'm sorry, my dear.
[2:57:59.300 --> 2:58:09.300]  But where are the clowns? Ascending the clowns.
[2:58:09.300 --> 2:58:15.300]  Don't bother there.
[2:58:15.300 --> 2:58:19.300]  The globalists have sent in the clowns. They've sent in antifa.
[2:58:19.300 --> 2:58:23.300]  They've broken our borders with some of the most hardened criminals from around the world.
[2:58:23.300 --> 2:58:27.300]  They've tried to poison us with fluoride and GMO and the tainted vaccines.
[2:58:27.300 --> 2:58:34.300]  They've sent in their clowns. But now, the men and women of America are taking action and confronting globalists everywhere.
[2:58:34.300 --> 2:58:44.300]  And I'm so proud of InfoWars leading the charge. But the only way we can do that is when you keep spreading the word about our broadcast and when you keep buying the great products at infowarstore.com.
[2:59:04.300 --> 2:59:13.300]  And I'm so proud of InfoWars that they rightfully see as a symbol of beacon of populism and freedom, not just to America, but to the whole world, that they can demoralize everybody else and win.
[2:59:13.300 --> 2:59:20.300]  Why? They can shut InfoWars down. They can intimidate everybody else. That's why it's beyond critical that you keep InfoWars on the air.
[2:59:20.300 --> 2:59:24.300]  It's only by your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support that we're on air.
[2:59:24.300 --> 2:59:27.300]  And I want to thank you all this Christmas for your past support.
[2:59:27.300 --> 2:59:35.300]  I want to encourage you now to redouble your efforts and financially support us by getting great products you need during the 12 days of Christmas at infowarstore.com.
[2:59:35.300 --> 3:00:01.300]  Massive sales, store-wide free shipping, double-patria points, infowarstore.com. Please take action now. George Soros hopes you don't.
[3:00:01.300 --> 3:00:15.300]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:15.300 --> 3:00:34.300]  An hour of the War Room is coming up with Owen Schreuer. He's been at Libtar demonstrations all day on the armored vehicle. By the way, they're throwing bottles at him, attacking him. That's why we got it, is because they literally attack us.
[3:00:34.300 --> 3:00:41.300]  I love all these callers. The drinking bros are here with us, tempting me. A little devil on my shoulder reminded me how delicious it all is.
[3:00:41.300 --> 3:00:53.300]  I actually never drank, folks. It's all a big act, act tough. And then let's take some calls here. Thank you, Charlie in Missouri for holding. Thank you. You're on the air.
[3:00:53.300 --> 3:01:01.300]  It's been hard to get through it. You guys have been so funny. I tip my hat to the drinking boys and the information you guys covered.
[3:01:01.300 --> 3:01:08.300]  I also have to agree with you about Melania. She'd be a Medusa to me. One look in her eyes, I'd probably turn right to stone.
[3:01:08.300 --> 3:01:19.300]  Let me tell you, I thought it was hot to last met her in person and I was like, I mean, I was cool about it, but I was just like, I was kind of scared walking up. I got like, my God, what's that bright light? 50 yards?
[3:01:19.300 --> 3:01:21.300]  You got clothes right.
[3:01:21.300 --> 3:01:25.300]  You look up beauty and addiction in her picture. She's going to be right there.
[3:01:25.300 --> 3:01:27.300]  Well, the photos don't capture it. I mean, it's...
[3:01:27.300 --> 3:01:29.300]  No, they don't.
[3:01:29.300 --> 3:01:39.300]  Charlie, it'll turn you to stone and to wood. Well, you ever seen like a really tough, you know, like badass guy? He's not trying to act tough. You can tell he's really tough. You're kind of like, man, that kind of intimidates me.
[3:01:39.300 --> 3:01:44.300]  Well, it's like, it's like she's feminine, but it's like, it's a tough dude. It's like, it's scary. She's scared.
[3:01:44.300 --> 3:01:45.300]  Yeah. Yeah.
[3:01:45.300 --> 3:01:52.300]  I got to tip my hat off to Owen. Boy, that is a slam dunk on Sleepy Joe. I love it and I love what you guys are doing.
[3:01:52.300 --> 3:01:56.300]  We're going to play the slam dunk coming in with Paul Watson next.
[3:01:56.300 --> 3:02:01.300]  Can I talk with you about the deep state and the new world order?
[3:02:01.300 --> 3:02:02.300]  Yes.
[3:02:02.300 --> 3:02:07.300]  Well, you know, the deep state, the deep state is nothing but the executive branch of the new world order anyway.
[3:02:07.300 --> 3:02:11.300]  And the United States is a foreign in their side and always has been.
[3:02:11.300 --> 3:02:22.300]  And if you think of the compartmentalization, like with the communications department, which would be the high tech and the public relations, which would be MSM, the executive branch would be the deep state.
[3:02:22.300 --> 3:02:26.300]  And you know what's the hotline to the deep state is the security clearance.
[3:02:26.300 --> 3:02:32.300]  Now, why does Brennan and Clapper and Kerry have a hotline with security clearance?
[3:02:32.300 --> 3:02:38.300]  They can just go to England. They could just go to Italy. They could just go to Australia and they can accomplish their dirty deeds.
[3:02:38.300 --> 3:02:45.300]  That's right. They've got access and Trump said, take it away from Brennan and it didn't happen showing the rebellion going on.
[3:02:45.300 --> 3:02:48.300]  I say, arrest that piece of filth.
[3:02:48.300 --> 3:02:53.300]  Exactly. Well, look at how he's attacking. Trump knows business.
[3:02:53.300 --> 3:03:00.300]  He's attacking the compartment, the deep state compartment, the high tech compartment, the public relations department.
[3:03:00.300 --> 3:03:10.300]  And now with the loss in England and Boris into power, you've got to figure now there's two thorns in the new world order side.
[3:03:10.300 --> 3:03:13.300]  Forget about the deep state. They're reporting to the new world order.
[3:03:13.300 --> 3:03:14.300]  There's going to be three.
[3:03:14.300 --> 3:03:16.300]  I think we're pulling the strings of the deep state.
[3:03:16.300 --> 3:03:18.300]  What's the third?
[3:03:18.300 --> 3:03:23.300]  They don't care about elections. They don't care about who's in office. They don't care if they're in office.
[3:03:23.300 --> 3:03:29.300]  So, Dan Holloway, what's the third thorn on their side? And this is a super smart caller.
[3:03:29.300 --> 3:03:35.300]  I think it's going to be Germany, to be honest. I think they've had enough of Merkel. I think they've had enough of...
[3:03:35.300 --> 3:03:37.300]  I agree. Germany is the next shoe to drink.
[3:03:37.300 --> 3:03:40.300]  I agree. There's no way that's sustainable.
[3:03:40.300 --> 3:03:41.300]  And then France?
[3:03:41.300 --> 3:03:45.300]  Just allowing all the immigrants to come in. I'm not against immigration.
[3:03:45.300 --> 3:03:47.300]  You can't run around and rape all the women and scream a lot.
[3:03:47.300 --> 3:03:49.300]  There's a way to go about doing that.
[3:03:49.300 --> 3:03:50.300]  I don't run around screaming a lot.
[3:03:50.300 --> 3:03:55.300]  Milo came on our show and talked about it. He said it should be a lottery based on talent plus human compassion.
[3:03:55.300 --> 3:03:59.300]  It should be a combination of those two things. Not just, let's open it up. Let's see what happens, guys.
[3:03:59.300 --> 3:04:03.300]  To 85% military aged men, jihadis, and puma jumpsuits.
[3:04:03.300 --> 3:04:07.300]  Yeah, I mean, it's not going to work. It's not going to work. And people at some point are going to...
[3:04:07.300 --> 3:04:12.300]  You're a dog that looks good to me. I will teach you the ways of Allah's pity.
[3:04:12.300 --> 3:04:14.300]  Do you mind if I wear your kangal?
[3:04:14.300 --> 3:04:16.300]  No, you can't wear a kangal.
[3:04:16.300 --> 3:04:17.300]  No, that's done.
[3:04:17.300 --> 3:04:21.300]  Unless you're Samuel Jackson, you should be wearing a kangal.
[3:04:21.300 --> 3:04:25.300]  Hey, Charlie, call me again. We love you.
[3:04:25.300 --> 3:04:29.300]  And Paul Watson's coming up. And I've got the little promo intro here.
[3:04:29.300 --> 3:04:32.300]  So I'm going to save out of these guys, but I'm going to tape for their show.
[3:04:32.300 --> 3:04:37.300]  Then I'm going to be back and I'll be back on the war room and I'll be hanging around here stalking in full wars all day.
[3:04:37.300 --> 3:04:40.300]  In fact, let's get the caller's name and number because they held too long.
[3:04:40.300 --> 3:04:43.300]  I promise I'm going to do the war room later and I will call you and I will put you on there first.
[3:04:43.300 --> 3:04:47.300]  I love you. You're awesome. Stay with us. And guys, you're awesome. Thanks for coming in.
[3:04:47.300 --> 3:04:48.300]  Absolutely.
[3:04:48.300 --> 3:04:49.300]  Do not visit their website.
[3:04:49.300 --> 3:05:14.300]  Freekingbrows.com. Just don't do it.
[3:05:14.300 --> 3:05:40.300]  Thank you.
[3:05:40.300 --> 3:06:06.300]  Thank you.
[3:06:06.300 --> 3:06:35.300]  Thank you.
[3:06:35.300 --> 3:06:41.300]  Here's part of what happened in San Antonio this weekend. The video is on info wars.com. Here it is.
[3:06:41.300 --> 3:07:06.300]  We can't let this happen.
[3:07:06.300 --> 3:07:13.300]  I'm going to take on those rapists Mexicans.
[3:07:13.300 --> 3:07:16.300]  That's a lie, Joe. That's a lie.
[3:07:16.300 --> 3:07:17.300]  Oh, it is a lie.
[3:07:17.300 --> 3:07:25.300]  Yeah. And it was your son in the Ukraine.
[3:07:25.300 --> 3:07:28.300]  We're not going to give you the billion dollars.
[3:07:28.300 --> 3:07:33.300]  They said, you have no authority. You're not the president. The president said, I said, call him.
[3:07:33.300 --> 3:07:36.300]  I said, I'm telling you, you're not getting the billion dollars.
[3:07:36.300 --> 3:07:38.300]  You're the one that offered to withhold a billion dollars.
[3:07:38.300 --> 3:07:39.300]  Bam.
[3:07:39.300 --> 3:07:41.300]  The cancel of foreign relations.
[3:07:41.300 --> 3:07:45.300]  I said, you're not getting the billion. I'm going to be leaving here. I think it was, what, six hours?
[3:07:45.300 --> 3:07:47.300]  I looked, I said, I'm leaving in six hours.
[3:07:47.300 --> 3:07:50.300]  If the prosecutor's not fired, you're not getting the money.
[3:07:50.300 --> 3:07:52.300]  Oh, son of a bitch.
[3:07:52.300 --> 3:07:54.300]  You got fired.
[3:07:54.300 --> 3:07:58.300]  Son of a bitch. You got fired, right, Joe?
[3:07:58.300 --> 3:08:01.300]  Son of a bitch. You got fired, right?
[3:08:01.300 --> 3:08:05.300]  Oh, son of a bitch. You got fired.
[3:08:05.300 --> 3:08:09.300]  Trump is innocent. Trump is innocent.
[3:08:09.300 --> 3:08:12.300]  InfoWars.com.
[3:08:12.300 --> 3:08:14.300]  InfoWars.com.
[3:08:14.300 --> 3:08:18.300]  Just total victory, man. Just total victory.
[3:08:18.300 --> 3:08:21.300]  It's like watching a slam dunk of truth just boom.
[3:08:21.300 --> 3:08:23.300]  Like the Michael Jordan cap.
[3:08:23.300 --> 3:08:36.300]  All right. Paul Joseph Watson is about to take over the balance of the hour from London, England.
[3:08:36.300 --> 3:08:39.300]  And then the war rooms coming up with over Troyer and the rest of the crew.
[3:08:39.300 --> 3:08:43.300]  They have been downtown in the melee of the anti-Trump rallies.
[3:08:43.300 --> 3:08:45.300]  You got a lot of footage of that.
[3:08:45.300 --> 3:08:47.300]  There is a huge chain reaction taking place.
[3:08:47.300 --> 3:08:49.300]  So many videos I didn't even get to today.
[3:08:49.300 --> 3:08:58.300]  So many. I haven't even had time to watch people confronting Pelosi and Maxine Waters and Adam Schiff and Nadler and Biden.
[3:08:58.300 --> 3:09:02.300]  And so many times they're saying infowars.com.
[3:09:02.300 --> 3:09:04.300]  It's kind of like Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself.
[3:09:04.300 --> 3:09:07.300]  It means you're on the DL. You know what's going on.
[3:09:07.300 --> 3:09:09.300]  They're not pulling the wool over your eyes.
[3:09:09.300 --> 3:09:16.300]  I want to thank the listeners doing that because we're fighting to keep all this crew that we have in place.
[3:09:16.300 --> 3:09:25.300]  And I'm doing stuff like got my house up on the market, which I always plan to keep some money back in our house that was paid for to sell if I needed it to actually expand.
[3:09:25.300 --> 3:09:30.300]  We're hiring some more people for 2020 with 321 days out because I'm not giving up.
[3:09:30.300 --> 3:09:33.300]  But I need you to do your Christmas shopping at infowarsstore.com.
[3:09:33.300 --> 3:09:35.300]  I refuse to contract.
[3:09:35.300 --> 3:09:37.300]  We're going to expand the face of this. It's too critical.
[3:09:37.300 --> 3:09:47.300]  And I had a fellow walk up to me on the street and say, hey, I got my dad that really nice Damascus steel booze knife you're selling.
[3:09:47.300 --> 3:09:49.300]  That's a really good deal.
[3:09:49.300 --> 3:09:51.300]  And I went to Damascus booze knife.
[3:09:51.300 --> 3:09:55.300]  I told Tim Prashay and the guys that source stuff, you know, get good deals and high quality things.
[3:09:55.300 --> 3:09:58.300]  And so I said, we're selling a Damascus steel booze knife.
[3:09:58.300 --> 3:10:00.300]  He goes, yeah, we bought like 300 of them.
[3:10:00.300 --> 3:10:01.300]  There's 200 left.
[3:10:01.300 --> 3:10:03.300]  I said, well, get me one.
[3:10:03.300 --> 3:10:05.300]  Well, this is a really nice booze knife.
[3:10:05.300 --> 3:10:07.300]  And it's camel bone.
[3:10:07.300 --> 3:10:09.300]  And you got to go read about it.
[3:10:09.300 --> 3:10:11.300]  There's only 200 of these left, 200 and something.
[3:10:11.300 --> 3:10:13.300]  And it helps fund our operation.
[3:10:13.300 --> 3:10:17.300]  You're not going to find a knife like this in stores for that price.
[3:10:17.300 --> 3:10:21.300]  These are like $150 to $200 knives.
[3:10:21.300 --> 3:10:23.300]  $99.95.
[3:10:23.300 --> 3:10:24.300]  It's a great deal.
[3:10:24.300 --> 3:10:26.300]  No reviews yet because nobody's put the reviews up.
[3:10:26.300 --> 3:10:30.300]  But some have obviously hit the street because somebody told me they bought one here and liked it.
[3:10:30.300 --> 3:10:33.300]  So I said, can I please see this wondrous knife?
[3:10:33.300 --> 3:10:35.300]  And guess what?
[3:10:35.300 --> 3:10:36.300]  I doubt my dad's watching right now.
[3:10:36.300 --> 3:10:39.300]  This one's mine.
[3:10:39.300 --> 3:10:41.300]  My dad likes to skin there and all that stuff.
[3:10:41.300 --> 3:10:44.300]  It's really a nice booze knife, not too big, not too little.
[3:10:44.300 --> 3:10:47.300]  And it's the Damascus steel, really high quality, very, very sharp.
[3:10:47.300 --> 3:10:50.300]  So look out with a nice leather scabbard.
[3:10:50.300 --> 3:10:51.300]  Read all about it.
[3:10:51.300 --> 3:10:59.300]  There's a lot more that you'll find out at info wars store.com about the booze knife.

[3:12:09.300 --> 3:12:15.300]  Will Johnson's, NDC, every day, huge viral confrontations, millions of views, the president tweeting it out.
[3:12:15.300 --> 3:12:16.300]  I mean, I'm so proud of this crew.
[3:12:16.300 --> 3:12:18.300]  I'm so proud of Paul Watson.
[3:12:18.300 --> 3:12:21.300]  He's got Summit.News, but still does great work for InfoWars.
[3:12:21.300 --> 3:12:22.300]  We're all in this together.
[3:12:22.300 --> 3:12:25.300]  And we've been a sponsor and helped out Summit.News.
[3:12:25.300 --> 3:12:27.300]  And we've got this new t-shirt.
[3:12:27.300 --> 3:12:30.300]  Don't visit InfoWars.com.
[3:12:30.300 --> 3:12:32.300]  People love this shirt.
[3:12:32.300 --> 3:12:36.300]  It's got the woke Alex Jones, the laser beam eyes with the They Live Sunglasses.
[3:12:36.300 --> 3:12:38.300]  Don't visit InfoWars.
[3:12:38.300 --> 3:12:41.300]  That way, if you're in a libtard area, you go, yeah, that filthy scumbag.
[3:12:41.300 --> 3:12:44.300]  And then, you know, get intel on them, InfoWars.com on the back.
[3:12:44.300 --> 3:12:46.300]  We'll probably figure it out and try to kill you.
[3:12:46.300 --> 3:12:48.300]  But, you know, they're commie scum, so screw them.
[3:12:48.300 --> 3:12:53.300]  Most areas you run into fans and people, so it's like choose your own adventure wearing an Alex Jones shirt.

[3:13:07.300 --> 3:13:13.300]  Now from London, Summit.News, Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:13:13.300 --> 3:13:18.300]  Thanks, Alex, and I've been hacking my guts up like Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail.
[3:13:18.300 --> 3:13:20.300]  So, yeah, this goes.
[3:13:20.300 --> 3:13:25.300]  We're going to start with the fallout from the UK election, which of course happened last Thursday.
[3:13:25.300 --> 3:13:30.300]  Early signs seem to be quite positive in terms of Boris Johnson's new government
[3:13:30.300 --> 3:13:32.300]  and what it's going to look like going forward.
[3:13:32.300 --> 3:13:34.300]  There's a headline here from Breitbart.
[3:13:34.300 --> 3:13:38.300]  Tories to appoint brexit appears to balance Remainers Lords.
[3:13:38.300 --> 3:13:42.300]  Prime Minister Boris Johnson is reportedly planning to grant peerages
[3:13:42.300 --> 3:13:47.300]  to Tory Brexiteers in order to rebalance the Remainer-dominated House of Lords.
[3:13:47.300 --> 3:13:49.300]  So they're going to tackle that.
[3:13:49.300 --> 3:13:55.300]  They had 800 peers out of those 800 Lords, only 50 were Eurosceptic.
[3:13:55.300 --> 3:13:59.300]  So they're going to try and rebalance that in the House of Lords.
[3:13:59.300 --> 3:14:02.300]  We also have this headline from Summit.News.
[3:14:02.300 --> 3:14:07.300]  No to champagne with billionaires Boris Johnson to boycott Davos.
[3:14:07.300 --> 3:14:12.300]  He said, our focus is on delivering for the people, not champagne with billionaires.
[3:14:12.300 --> 3:14:14.300]  So they're not going to attend Davos.
[3:14:14.300 --> 3:14:18.300]  They're not going to have any representatives from the new UK government attending Davos.
[3:14:18.300 --> 3:14:23.300]  We'll wait and see what happens at Bilderberg, which of course is seen by many as more powerful,
[3:14:23.300 --> 3:14:25.300]  as it's more secretive than Davos.
[3:14:25.300 --> 3:14:31.300]  Trump refused or scrapped a scheduled delegation visit to Davos back in January,
[3:14:31.300 --> 3:14:36.300]  although I think he's going to be there or his representatives are going to be there next month.
[3:14:36.300 --> 3:14:38.300]  But Boris Johnson's on.
[3:14:38.300 --> 3:14:42.300]  So that is an exciting development there.
[3:14:42.300 --> 3:14:45.300]  Zero Hedge reports, the elites don't give an F.
[3:14:45.300 --> 3:14:48.300]  Bannon explains why Boris won.
[3:14:48.300 --> 3:14:53.300]  We're going to get into his comments after the break because that's going to take slightly longer.
[3:14:53.300 --> 3:14:58.300]  But have the left, have the Labour Party learn their lesson that rabid identity politics,
[3:14:58.300 --> 3:15:04.300]  climate change, hysteria, and democracy busting anti-Brexit hatred
[3:15:04.300 --> 3:15:06.300]  doesn't resonate with the voters.
[3:15:06.300 --> 3:15:09.300]  If you insult your own voters for three and a half years straight,
[3:15:09.300 --> 3:15:13.300]  calling them racist bigots whose votes shouldn't have counted,
[3:15:13.300 --> 3:15:15.300]  probably not the best election strategy.
[3:15:15.300 --> 3:15:17.300]  Have they learned their lesson?
[3:15:17.300 --> 3:15:19.300]  No, they've doubled down.
[3:15:19.300 --> 3:15:24.300]  Newly elected Labour MP and Corbyn loyalist, Claudia Webb,
[3:15:24.300 --> 3:15:28.300]  to the party has lots to celebrate from the election.
[3:15:28.300 --> 3:15:35.300]  Really, their worst performance in 85 years, lots to celebrate from the election.
[3:15:35.300 --> 3:15:40.300]  She says the leadership isn't to blame for the result, even though time and time again,
[3:15:40.300 --> 3:15:43.300]  they asked Labour voters why they switched to Conservative.
[3:15:43.300 --> 3:15:45.300]  They blamed the leadership.
[3:15:45.300 --> 3:15:46.300]  They will double down.
[3:15:46.300 --> 3:15:47.300]  They will never learn their lesson.
[3:15:47.300 --> 3:15:49.300]  We're going to be back to talk about that and more in the next segment.
[3:15:49.300 --> 3:15:51.300]  Summit.News, don't go away.
[3:15:51.300 --> 3:15:52.300]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[3:15:52.300 --> 3:15:56.300]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[3:15:56.300 --> 3:15:58.300]  I sued the IRS in one.
[3:15:58.300 --> 3:16:01.300]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[3:16:01.300 --> 3:16:05.300]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems
[3:16:05.300 --> 3:16:07.300]  they thought might never be solved.
[3:16:07.300 --> 3:16:08.300]  I can help you too.
[3:16:08.300 --> 3:16:11.300]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[3:16:11.300 --> 3:16:13.300]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[3:16:13.300 --> 3:16:21.300]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[3:16:21.300 --> 3:16:27.300]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[3:16:27.300 --> 3:16:30.300]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[3:16:30.300 --> 3:16:36.300]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[3:16:36.300 --> 3:16:40.300]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[3:16:40.300 --> 3:16:41.300]  Was there ever a vote?
[3:16:41.300 --> 3:16:42.300]  Who do we fight for?
[3:16:42.300 --> 3:16:45.300]  The deep state began with World War I.
[3:16:45.300 --> 3:16:51.300]  The United States of Empire by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.
[3:16:51.300 --> 3:16:54.300]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[3:16:54.300 --> 3:16:57.300]  So do you know who's on your wireless network?
[3:16:57.300 --> 3:17:04.300]  Whether it's a big company selling your data or a foreign hacker, if you're not protected, everybody sees your information.
[3:17:04.300 --> 3:17:09.300]  That's why you need Flash Routers, a custom Wi-Fi router created for privacy.

[3:18:15.300 --> 3:18:27.300]  The globalists have sent in the clowns. They've sent in Antifa.
[3:18:27.300 --> 3:18:31.300]  They've broken our borders with some of the most hardened criminals from around the world.
[3:18:31.300 --> 3:18:35.300]  They've tried to poison us with fluoride and GMO and the tainted vaccines.
[3:18:35.300 --> 3:18:37.300]  They've sent in their clowns.
[3:18:37.300 --> 3:18:43.300]  But now, the men and women of America are taking action and confronting globalists everywhere.
[3:18:43.300 --> 3:18:46.300]  And I'm so proud of InfoWars leading the charge.
[3:18:46.300 --> 3:18:54.300]  But the only way we can do that is when you keep spreading the word about our broadcast and when you keep buying the great products at InfoWarsTour dot com.
[3:18:54.300 --> 3:18:59.300]  I've got a problem that I want to confess to the listeners and viewers.
[3:18:59.300 --> 3:19:07.300]  I've been on the air so long that I take it for granted now when we break some massive story that changes the whole world.
[3:19:07.300 --> 3:19:13.300]  And that really does great things for the future of not just our children, but our children's children.
[3:19:13.300 --> 3:19:15.300]  InfoWars really has changed history.
[3:19:15.300 --> 3:19:23.300]  And that's why I need to pull back and ask the listeners, because I know you're a lot like me, to really think about a world without InfoWars.
[3:19:23.300 --> 3:19:33.300]  Because I can tell you right now, if people don't really step to the plate and really financially support our broadcast going into 2020, we're not going to be on the air in a year or so.
[3:19:33.300 --> 3:19:41.300]  If you do support us, we're not just going to stay on the air, but we are going to expand in ways that are going to blow you away.
[3:19:41.300 --> 3:19:44.300]  I've never let you down, you've never let me down.
[3:19:44.300 --> 3:20:06.300]  Step up to the plate now, go to InfoWarsTour dot com, buy great products and fund our operation and watch us make history together again.
[3:20:06.300 --> 3:20:16.300]  Live from London, England, it's Paul Joseph Watson with Summit Dot News.
[3:20:16.300 --> 3:20:20.300]  We are back and we are continuing to cover the fallout from the UK election.
[3:20:20.300 --> 3:20:24.300]  Of course, Labour, the left wing party had their worst result in 85 years.
[3:20:24.300 --> 3:20:26.300]  They're out there celebrating it.
[3:20:26.300 --> 3:20:28.300]  Apparently it was great.
[3:20:28.300 --> 3:20:34.300]  Jeremy Corbyn says that he won the argument, even though he was completely obliterated.
[3:20:34.300 --> 3:20:47.300]  Of course, one of the main reasons they won is because working-class people in northern areas of England voted Conservative in some cases for the first time in 50, 60, 70 years.
[3:20:47.300 --> 3:20:58.300]  We had all these seats that were safe Labour seats for decades and decades, places like false-over, places like live, places like Workington, most of them again up in the north.
[3:20:58.300 --> 3:21:11.300]  Suddenly switched to Tory to Conservative seats because, again, the voters had been insulted, denigrated for the past three and a half years as racist bigots whose votes in the Brexit referendum shouldn't have counted.
[3:21:11.300 --> 3:21:17.300]  Labour has become the party of the upper middle class London latte sipping bubble.
[3:21:17.300 --> 3:21:26.300]  They've stopped representing the working-class people and that's why they lost a devastating amount of seats in this recent election.
[3:21:26.300 --> 3:21:32.300]  And Steve Bannon's been talking about it, headline out of Zero Hedge, The Elites Don't Give an F.
[3:21:32.300 --> 3:21:35.300]  Bannon explains why Boris won.
[3:21:35.300 --> 3:21:37.300]  He sat down with The Guardian for an interview.
[3:21:37.300 --> 3:21:44.300]  He said, Boris Johnson sweeping UK victory over Labour's Jeremy Corbyn is a victory for populism.
[3:21:44.300 --> 3:21:51.300]  Noting how he was fascinated by focus groups on British TV, he said these were Labour voters and they were not going to vote for Labour.
[3:21:51.300 --> 3:21:57.300]  And the reason was they kept asking, how are these programs going to be paid for?
[3:21:57.300 --> 3:22:02.300]  He said he was impressed with the specificity and the granularity of the questions.
[3:22:02.300 --> 3:22:04.300]  And again, that is the point.
[3:22:04.300 --> 3:22:14.300]  They dangled all this free stuff, didn't explain to any sufficient degree how they were going to pay for it, including free university tuition, which we're going to get onto.
[3:22:14.300 --> 3:22:18.300]  But Bannon said, people don't want to be spun anymore.
[3:22:18.300 --> 3:22:20.300]  They don't want to be BSed anymore.
[3:22:20.300 --> 3:22:23.300]  They want to know what you're laying out and how you're going to effectuate it.
[3:22:23.300 --> 3:22:26.300]  Most importantly, how are you going to pay for it?
[3:22:26.300 --> 3:22:32.300]  And if paying for it means more increased taxes or less opportunities for me, you're not going to get my vote no matter how good it sounds.
[3:22:32.300 --> 3:22:37.300]  So he's basically echoing what we already knew.
[3:22:37.300 --> 3:22:45.300]  With the free university tuition, which the Labour Party again dangled as this free promise with no clear path as to how to pay for it.
[3:22:45.300 --> 3:22:58.300]  The reason they did this, and I talked about this briefly with Alex yesterday, is the same way they opened up the borders to mass immigration under Tony Blair in the late 1990s to create a massive voting block.
[3:22:58.300 --> 3:23:06.300]  Because people who attend university in the United Kingdom, even as they get older, their opinions don't tend to become more conservative.
[3:23:06.300 --> 3:23:17.300]  They tend to stay exactly the same because they've attended Marxist brainwashing camps who are very good at social engineering and making sure the propaganda sticks.
[3:23:17.300 --> 3:23:24.300]  Which is why at these pro-EU anti-Brexit marches in London for much of the time, you do see a lot of older people.
[3:23:24.300 --> 3:23:27.300]  You see a lot of younger people, but also a lot of older people.
[3:23:27.300 --> 3:23:33.300]  You also see them at Extinction Rebellion, climate change marches as well.
[3:23:33.300 --> 3:23:41.300]  This is out of right, but darling Paul, if Boris can't come to the red menace in education, this is the last ever conservative government.
[3:23:41.300 --> 3:23:55.300]  He goes on to explain this map, which is in this article, which if you only look at how 18 to 24 year olds voted, the map is a sea of red representing the left wing Labour Party.
[3:23:55.300 --> 3:24:01.300]  Of course, many people say, well, these people are going to get older, they're going to become more mature, they're going to start owning property,
[3:24:01.300 --> 3:24:03.300]  they're going to start earning more of their own money.
[3:24:03.300 --> 3:24:08.300]  They're naturally going to become a less big government, more conservative.
[3:24:08.300 --> 3:24:12.300]  But again, not always the case when they've been in these Marxist brainwashing camps.
[3:24:12.300 --> 3:24:15.300]  And he makes the point in this article.
[3:24:15.300 --> 3:24:21.300]  He says, the question will I hope be among the highest priorities of the new Boris Johnson administration.
[3:24:21.300 --> 3:24:28.300]  What, after all, will be the point of all the economy boosting life enhancing measures Boris has got planned for Britain.
[3:24:28.300 --> 3:24:32.300]  If they're going to be undone by a new red surge.
[3:24:32.300 --> 3:24:34.300]  And he makes the point.
[3:24:34.300 --> 3:24:37.300]  Tony Blair always remained the hardcore Trotsky.
[3:24:37.300 --> 3:24:51.300]  He was at university, which is why he set in place this program of trying to get 50% of school leavers in the United Kingdom to go to university because then they attend the Marxist brainwashing camps.
[3:24:51.300 --> 3:24:57.300]  Before Blair Institute at the push for that policy, it was only 10%.
[3:24:57.300 --> 3:25:04.300]  Now, most of these kids are going to have their lives ruined by going to university when they shouldn't have done so in the first place.
[3:25:04.300 --> 3:25:14.300]  The amount of people I know that have got completely useless university degrees and they're doing jobs, which have got nothing to do with those degrees is astronomical.
[3:25:14.300 --> 3:25:22.300]  And again, this takes away people from doing other jobs, which then have to be filled by immigrants, whether legal or illegal.
[3:25:22.300 --> 3:25:29.300]  And again, they leave college with mountains and mountains of debt. They can't get on the property ladder because they're already in debt.
[3:25:29.300 --> 3:25:31.300]  It ruins their lives.
[3:25:31.300 --> 3:25:39.300]  But they stay fixed with the same beliefs about social justice, about identity politics, and they vote lifelong labor.
[3:25:39.300 --> 3:25:47.300]  That is why labor wanted to dangle that free college tuition to create this voting block basically in perpetuity.
[3:25:47.300 --> 3:25:49.300]  It hasn't happened yet.
[3:25:49.300 --> 3:25:55.300]  But again, most of these people, these 18 to 24 year old demographic are not going to change their mind.
[3:25:55.300 --> 3:26:07.300]  So that sea of red is only going to increase if people on the right do not reach out and have a better, more cohesive message to offer the zoomers in society.
[3:26:07.300 --> 3:26:12.300]  Meanwhile, media claims British Muslims have begun to leave the UK after Boris Wynn.
[3:26:12.300 --> 3:26:21.300]  Of course, this is complete BS made up, completely made up, even though it was published by one of the, I think, the biggest outlet in the UK, the Metro.
[3:26:21.300 --> 3:26:30.300]  This is out of Breitbart. British Muslims have begun to leave the UK after Boris Johnson won the election, according to the alarmist headlines of the journalist writing for a major newspaper.
[3:26:30.300 --> 3:26:35.300]  Writing for the Metro were once fairly neutral, but increasingly left biased newspaper.
[3:26:35.300 --> 3:26:43.300]  Basit Mahoud, good old British name, claimed that British Muslims have started the process of leaving the UK of fears for their personal safety.
[3:26:43.300 --> 3:26:46.300]  Now Boris Johnson is Prime Minister.
[3:26:46.300 --> 3:26:56.300]  However, the article only actually mentions discussions between the online wing of Metro and two other people, neither of whom have actually left the country.
[3:26:56.300 --> 3:27:05.300]  So this is basically some kind of virtue signaling exercise between three people on Twitter, mainly about, oh, I'm so scared. I'm going to leave the country.
[3:27:05.300 --> 3:27:12.300]  None of them are going to leave the country. Where are they going to go? Are they going to go back to Pakistan? Are they going to go to Bangladesh?
[3:27:12.300 --> 3:27:22.300]  Not great places to find work and raise a family. Of course, this is all virtue signaling. This is all trying to create a new moral panic, a new hysteria.
[3:27:22.300 --> 3:27:37.300]  We saw the same thing after Brexit, where we had this explosion in incidents of hate crime, even though when you drill down into the numbers, it was reports of hate crime that had increased when they actually investigated these hate crimes.
[3:27:37.300 --> 3:27:39.300]  The numbers were completely level.
[3:27:39.300 --> 3:27:53.300]  So because the media gins up all this hysteria about racism, homophobia, Islamophobia, it makes people think that more instances of certain very miltoast behavior is a hate crime.
[3:27:53.300 --> 3:28:08.300]  In fact, we had a story a couple of weeks ago where they said that people who are racist in hospitals in the UK, and again, racist is this vast swath of vague definitions, which could basically be anything at this point.
[3:28:08.300 --> 3:28:17.300]  You know, snapping at somebody because you're frustrated about not getting treated quick enough that doctor or nurse happens to be an ethnic minority.
[3:28:17.300 --> 3:28:29.300]  Oh, y'all of a sudden you're a racist and you get denied treatment. I actually discussed in one case, implemented it, I believe, denying treatment in hospitals to racist.
[3:28:29.300 --> 3:28:33.300]  Another example of this hysteria that's being ginned up.
[3:28:33.300 --> 3:28:38.300]  So again, we're going to see more of that in the aftermath of this Boris Johnson re-election.
[3:28:38.300 --> 3:28:45.300]  Even though when you drill down into the hate crime numbers as happened after Brexit, it was a contrived moral panic.
[3:28:45.300 --> 3:28:48.300]  It did not get worse.
[3:28:48.300 --> 3:28:49.300]  We'll be back.
[3:28:49.300 --> 3:29:15.300]  That's all the news. Don't go away.
[3:29:15.300 --> 3:29:19.300]  I'm not sure what pressure has normalized my diabetes has totally improved.

[3:29:25.300 --> 3:29:33.300]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[3:29:54.300 --> 3:29:57.300]  We're closing out the year 2019.
[3:29:57.300 --> 3:30:03.300]  I don't have to tell you that 2020 is going to be maker to break it. Not just for M4 Wars, not just for America, but the whole world.
[3:30:03.300 --> 3:30:09.300]  We are in a battle between the forces of globalism that want to post-human world and those that want to pro-human world.
[3:30:09.300 --> 3:30:17.300]  We're in a fight between Satan and Christ and it's being played out amongst us mortals, but it's being directed from on high.
[3:30:17.300 --> 3:30:23.300]  And I'm just telling the listeners this broadcast, without you, we're going to lose this fight.
[3:30:23.300 --> 3:30:28.300]  I need all of you to realize how important you are and how important M4 Wars is and what we've done together.
[3:30:28.300 --> 3:30:34.300]  And to just take stock and take measure here at the end of the year and think about what you're going to do.
[3:30:34.300 --> 3:30:40.300]  Whether supporting M4 Wars or buying products from us or starting your own show, just whatever you do, take action now.
[3:30:40.300 --> 3:30:47.300]  History is happening. Please do your Christmas shopping. Please do your new year shopping at M4WarsTour.com.
[3:30:47.300 --> 3:30:51.300]  We've got the best products. You're only helping the globalists if you don't do it. Thank you.
[3:30:51.300 --> 3:30:57.300]  The best product. I'm not supposed to be biased, but I'm going to tell you all now. If you haven't tried Turboforce, you need to try it.
[3:30:57.300 --> 3:31:03.300]  I've tried Turboforce with everything. Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy. I put Turboforce in my coffee.
[3:31:03.300 --> 3:31:08.300]  That was a crazy week. I don't remember sleeping, but as far as the products go, Turboforce is my favorite.
[3:31:08.300 --> 3:31:15.300]  And all the M4 Wars products are down to taking control of your life, taking control of your health, not relying on other people to do it for you.
[3:31:15.300 --> 3:31:21.300]  Nobody wakes up in the morning and thinks, I'm going to give that person over there a better life.
[3:31:21.300 --> 3:31:27.300]  I'm going to wake up today. You know what? I'm going to spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier, and richer.
[3:31:27.300 --> 3:31:30.300]  I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend. I don't think that happens very often.
[3:31:30.300 --> 3:31:34.300]  It's never happened to me. I've never had anyone knock on my door and said, Tate, you're such a good guy.
[3:31:34.300 --> 3:31:39.300]  How can I improve your life in every single way? There's only one person who woke up and fought that, and that was me.
[3:31:39.300 --> 3:31:45.300]  I woke up and thought, you know what? Okay, I want to take control of my life. I want to take control of my health, and that's why you need to go to infowars.com.
[3:31:45.300 --> 3:31:50.300]  Take control of your health right now and support the resistance. Don't buy into the group. Don't drink the Kool-Aid. Drink the Turboforce.
[3:31:50.300 --> 3:31:52.300]  Kool-Aid's bad and the Turboforce is good.
[3:31:52.300 --> 3:32:01.300]  It's your last chance to get the original designer limited edition Jeffrey Epstein Christmas sweater.
[3:32:01.300 --> 3:32:14.300]  The globalists are so scared of this story continuing to come out for people learning about the deep state and the international blackmail rings using kidnap women and children to compromise world leaders.
[3:32:14.300 --> 3:32:27.300]  They do not want this story continuing, and this is your last chance to get the limited edition Christmas sweater at infowars.com to help spread the word, to have a piece of history, and to fund our operation.
[3:32:27.300 --> 3:32:39.300]  Again, it says Christmas lights are a lot like Epstein. These things don't hang themselves on the front. On the back, it's got infowars.com and shows the O in infowars as a wreath that's also a noose.
[3:32:39.300 --> 3:32:47.300]  The system can't stand it when you promote things at the grassroots level. They can't stand it when you fund independent pro-America, pro-human media.
[3:32:47.300 --> 3:32:52.300]  That's why you've got to take advantage of this shirt and get it today at infowars.com.
[3:32:52.300 --> 3:32:58.300]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:03.300 --> 3:33:10.300]  You're listening to the Summit.News Radio Hour with Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:33:13.300 --> 3:33:20.300]  We are live going to get into what's happening in Europe with the ongoing march of cultural enrichment in Sweden once again.
[3:33:20.300 --> 3:33:27.300]  Meanwhile, Boris Johnson, Islam is the problem. Islamophobia, a natural reaction to Islam.
[3:33:27.300 --> 3:33:33.300]  He didn't just say that having been newly elected prime minister, that would be somewhat controversial.
[3:33:33.300 --> 3:33:42.300]  But he did pen it in a 2005 article drawing ample attention and controversy when he suggested Islamophobia was a natural reaction to Islam.
[3:33:42.300 --> 3:33:52.300]  This is out of nationalphile.com. So people are dragging up his old comments. This is from a 2005 spectator article in which he wrote,
[3:33:52.300 --> 3:34:02.300]  To any non-Muslim reader of the Quran, Islamophobia, fear of Islam seems a natural reaction and indeed exactly what that text is intended to provoke.
[3:34:02.300 --> 3:34:12.300]  Judged purely on its scripture to say nothing of what is preached in the mosque, it's the most viciously sectarian of all religions in its heartlessness towards unbelievers.
[3:34:12.300 --> 3:34:18.300]  That was said right after the London bombings in 2005 where he said, quote, Islam is the problem.
[3:34:18.300 --> 3:34:25.300]  In another article, and of course, this is what he got in trouble for earlier this year, I believe, or last year.
[3:34:25.300 --> 3:34:33.300]  Mr Johnson said, referring to those who wear a burqa, it's absolutely ridiculous that people should choose to go around looking like letterboxes.
[3:34:33.300 --> 3:34:39.300]  And the media camped outside his door for about two days to try and get him to back down to apologize.
[3:34:39.300 --> 3:34:47.300]  He basically ignored them and brought them cups of tea, which again goes to the point, never apologize, never back down.
[3:34:47.300 --> 3:34:52.300]  Simply ignore it, ride it out. It will eventually blow over.
[3:34:52.300 --> 3:34:59.300]  Sputnik reports UK Labour leaders' approval ratings plummet after comprehensive election defeat.
[3:34:59.300 --> 3:35:08.300]  Over 70% of Britons now have a negative opinion of Jeremy Corbyn, his left wing Labour Party leader, who still hasn't stood down by the way he said he'd resign.
[3:35:08.300 --> 3:35:12.300]  He's not going to stand down until it looks like March.
[3:35:12.300 --> 3:35:27.300]  After the Labour leader led his party to their worst election defeat since 1935, Corbyn's personal approval ratings had dropped dramatically from minus 27 to minus 50 in the wake of Labour's defeat in last week's election.
[3:35:27.300 --> 3:35:30.300]  That is absolutely devastating.
[3:35:30.300 --> 3:35:42.300]  Prior to the election, 32% of Britons had a favourable view of the Labour leader, while 59% had an unfavourable opinion, and now he's dropping like a stone even further.
[3:35:42.300 --> 3:35:49.300]  But in the aftermath of the election, we had more tolerance, more inclusivity, more diversity.
[3:35:49.300 --> 3:36:03.300]  When, and this is a headline from Summit News, UK Comedy Club cited inclusiveness when it announced blanket ban on Conservatives, because what could be more inclusive than banning an entire swath of the population?
[3:36:03.300 --> 3:36:13.300]  So inclusive, a comedy club in London that slapped the blanket ban on Conservatives in the aftermath of the UK election did so in the name of, quote, inclusiveness.
[3:36:13.300 --> 3:36:16.300]  Their word, not mine.
[3:36:16.300 --> 3:36:24.300]  Promoter Mark O'Neill reacted to the leftist Labour Party's crushing defeat by tweeting, quote, we're literally Hitler now.
[3:36:24.300 --> 3:36:32.300]  He actually tweeted that unironically and asserting that Conservative performers were no longer welcome at his comedy buy-bow event.
[3:36:32.300 --> 3:36:44.300]  And by the way, there's an event in London called Comedy Unleashed, and they dared to open up a platform to people from all political persuasions.
[3:36:44.300 --> 3:37:02.300]  As soon as they did so, a lot of us started going, people on the right in, you know, in the political circles in the UK and London, and they literally send spies to judge our reaction to see what we laugh at, to try and pick up on what we say to each other,
[3:37:02.300 --> 3:37:10.300]  to try and pick up on the hand signs, the signals, the behaviours, the mannerisms that we display during this comedy event.
[3:37:10.300 --> 3:37:23.300]  Vice Magazine literally sent a reporter to spy on our reactions to this comedy event, and then he wrote an article three months later, bizarrely, it took him three months to write this up,
[3:37:23.300 --> 3:37:38.300]  trying to make out that we were given, like, secret hand signs and secret signals to each other, secret smirks, secret facial expressions, and he was literally writing about, like, what we laughed at, what we laughed in response to at this comedy night.
[3:37:38.300 --> 3:37:49.300]  And I went there again last week, and they sent more spies. They were literally just running around trying to tattle on us and trying to listen to our conversations.
[3:37:49.300 --> 3:38:04.300]  It's like, how dare you? How dare you have your own safe space where you can go and laugh at some comedy, which isn't beset by the ever long walking on eggshells, which is politically correct comedy in the United Kingdom.
[3:38:04.300 --> 3:38:17.300]  But this is a different event, comedy by Beau. And the organiser of this event posted on Facebook after the election, be aware that if you are a Tory voter, you are no longer welcome to perform here.
[3:38:17.300 --> 3:38:23.300]  You can have your own free speech zone somewhere else, because there will not be a platform for you here.
[3:38:23.300 --> 3:38:42.300]  He went on to justify this by saying the values of the night are of tolerance, support, and inclusiveness. He literally used the word inclusiveness to justify zoning out, discriminating against, denigrating an entire segment of the population.
[3:38:42.300 --> 3:39:00.300]  These sorts of promote inclusivity by intentionally excluding people for having a different opinion. What's funny about it is that the organiser of the event, the galvaniser's union they call it, he basically runs an open mic night for this comedy club.
[3:39:00.300 --> 3:39:14.300]  I think the owners of that night, the galvaniser's union, in response to him trying to de-platform people, they de-platformed him and said, this is not what we're about, because a ton of people complained about it.
[3:39:14.300 --> 3:39:29.300]  So this Mark O'Neill guy was later forced to apologise after the galvaniser's union, which hosted the open mic night, parted ways with him, so basically they de-platformed him, meaning ironically he was the one who got de-platformed.
[3:39:29.300 --> 3:39:39.300]  The term inclusiveness is justification for an act that deliberately sought to exclude a huge chunk of the population, once again highlights how progressives have cannibalised the English language.
[3:39:39.300 --> 3:39:47.300]  The words tolerance and diversity are also routinely used by those who are almost always the most intolerant of diversity of opinion.
[3:39:47.300 --> 3:40:06.300]  So the guy who tried to exclude people in the name of inclusiveness tried to de-platform people in the name of inclusiveness himself has been de-platformed, what a shame that is, what a shame, because I'm sure his politically correct comedy night was so hilariously funny in the first place.
[3:40:06.300 --> 3:40:22.300]  Meanwhile, clown world strikes again, 13 academic sign letter climbing term, quantum supremacy is racist. They literally had a response to the Google supercomputer advancement, of course you remember that a few months ago.
[3:40:22.300 --> 3:40:33.300]  A Google computer achieved quantum supremacy by managing to perform a calculation in 200 seconds that would have taken the world's most powerful supercomputer 10,000 years.
[3:40:33.300 --> 3:40:47.300]  So they responded to this, not by celebrating the accomplishment with the rest of the scientific community, but by saying that the term quantum supremacy is racist and should not be used.
[3:40:47.300 --> 3:40:57.300]  Yes, this actually happened. 13 of them signed a letter, it was published by Nature, and they claimed the term was racist. They said, quote,
[3:40:57.300 --> 3:41:11.300]  In our view, supremacy has overtones of violence, neocolonialism and racism through its association with white supremacy, even though again this is a scientific term that has nothing to do with race or society.
[3:41:11.300 --> 3:41:22.300]  It's a scientific term. The letter states we call for the community to use quantum advantage instead. Advantage means something completely different to supremacy.
[3:41:22.300 --> 3:41:37.300]  Supremacy means the best. So they literally want to change the entire meaning of the term because they're triggered by the word supremacy, even though this is a scientific term.
[3:41:37.300 --> 3:41:53.300]  The letter also complained about other scientific, oh yeah, there's not enough to have one. Other scientific terms such as conquest, colonization and settlement can't use those words anymore, even though it's scientific, being politically incorrect
[3:41:53.300 --> 3:42:07.300]  because they evoke the terror, Nullius arguments of settler colonialism and must be contextualized against ongoing issues of neocolonialism, whatever that means. It's just a word salad.
[3:42:07.300 --> 3:42:23.300]  The woke minded can rest easy. However, reports are T is the next generation of scientists will be free of such hideous unconscious racism says Pomona College in California held a mandatory decolonizing physics and astronomy symposium on Wednesday.
[3:42:23.300 --> 3:42:32.300]  So again, most of these institutions are just capitulating to these language cannibalizer weirdo morons.
[3:42:32.300 --> 3:42:42.300]  Another perfect illustration of a demented power, my social justice warriors in academia are cannibalizing language to conform to their walk hysteria about racism and identity politics.
[3:42:42.300 --> 3:42:52.300]  They literally want to discourage and even ban the use of perfectly innocent scientific terms simply because some precious woke moron somewhere might be offended.

[3:45:58.300 --> 3:46:14.300]  As you age, preglonone levels in the body go down. Now in 60 seconds, I don't have time to tell you what preglonone does, but look into the fact that they've been prescribing it since the 1920s for people that have arthritis.
[3:46:14.300 --> 3:46:22.300]  And then it just gets wilder from there. Medical science knows all about this, but they suppress information about preglonone.
[3:46:22.300 --> 3:46:29.300]  We've got the best form of preglonone with a bunch of high quality vitamins and minerals in real red pill.

[3:47:03.300 --> 3:47:14.300]  You're listening to Summit.News with Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:47:14.300 --> 3:47:27.300]  We're live and before we get into some final news stories out of Europe, I want to tell you about the up to 75% off 12 days of Christmas sale, free shipping and double patriot points available right now at infowarstore.com.

[3:47:59.300 --> 3:48:10.300]  Over in Sweden, meanwhile, this is up on Summit.News, migrant gang beat urinate on teenager, more cultural enrichment from everyone's favorite progressive utopia.
[3:48:10.300 --> 3:48:18.300]  Basically, there's a story like this out of Sweden every week. Sometimes we don't even report on them. We don't even mention them.
[3:48:18.300 --> 3:48:32.300]  We have another one right here, a video out of Sweden shows a gang of migrants beating and urinating on a Swedish teenager in the latex example of cultural enrichment. The clip shows the boy being laughed at, insulted and beaten as the mob discusses taking money off him.
[3:48:32.300 --> 3:48:41.300]  Let me pee on him states one of the migrants before ordering the boy to open his mouth. The video is absolutely sickening of course.
[3:48:41.300 --> 3:48:50.300]  And the person who posted it, Henrik Paul Graham made the point. Remember, no go zones don't exist. Of course, they said no go zones were a conspiracy theory.
[3:48:50.300 --> 3:48:57.300]  They said that I was a liar for suggesting they were. They led an international media demonization campaign against me.
[3:48:57.300 --> 3:49:13.300]  Now they've just had a hundred grenade explosions in a year and the BBC is putting out headlines saying what's going on? Gee, I wonder. As we document in this article, despite massive problems with migrant crime, the Swedish government and authorities
[3:49:13.300 --> 3:49:29.300]  appear to be more intent on prosecuting those who complain about it. We've had story after story. Mainly they like to target all people and pensioners who ran about mass immigration on Facebook and they literally make them, frog march them into police stations
[3:49:29.300 --> 3:49:35.300]  and interrogate them, then hit them with fines, sometimes prison sentences.
[3:49:35.300 --> 3:49:48.300]  As we have previously highlighted, survey shows migrants are vastly overrepresented in violent crime and rapes in Sweden, but the government stopped gathering official statistics back in 2005. Gee, I wonder why.
[3:49:48.300 --> 3:49:59.300]  Long before the problem was exacerbated by the arrival of over 150 new refugees, many of whom are refugees, mainly from Islamic countries from 2015 onwards.
[3:49:59.300 --> 3:50:12.300]  Quillette put out a report recently showing that grenade attacks and deadly shootings in Sweden concerns over which were once derided as a conspiracy theory by the media now represent a, quote, national emergency.
[3:50:12.300 --> 3:50:26.300]  We've had so many prominent people in Swedish society, including the former CEO of trucking company Scania, warning that Sweden is heading towards civil war due to uncontrolled mass immigration.
[3:50:26.300 --> 3:50:38.300]  You also had the CEO of Volvo come out and said that the company is considering moving its headquarters out of Sweden in the future, partly due to a rise in violent crime.
[3:50:38.300 --> 3:50:54.300]  More than one shipping company, mail delivery companies also come out and said that they can't deliver packages in certain areas of Stockholm and Malmo because they get physically attacked by these new cultural enriches
[3:50:54.300 --> 3:51:04.300]  or they get the packages stolen. So now they're not even delivering in some of these areas. But again, these areas don't exist. According to the media, it's a conspiracy theory.
[3:51:04.300 --> 3:51:19.300]  As we highlighted back in November, a left-wing journalist in Sweden who vehemently supported mass immigration suddenly changed her tune, admitting that when it came to Sweden's crime rid and no-go areas, everyone knew it would end in disaster.
[3:51:19.300 --> 3:51:32.300]  That is a direct quote. Of course, we've highlighted the studies which show the celebrities and the politicians in Sweden who virtue signal most vehemently about how much they love mass immigration.
[3:51:32.300 --> 3:51:42.300]  Basically, none of them live in areas of Sweden where they have the highest immigration, do as we say, not as we do.
[3:51:42.300 --> 3:51:52.300]  Sweden is basically becoming a failed society. Their population is going to be a minority. Ethnic Swedes are going to be a minority by 2040 to 2050.
[3:51:52.300 --> 3:51:58.300]  And more of this is what they've got to look forward to. I bet they can't wait.
[3:51:58.300 --> 3:52:12.300]  The only positive outcome of this, of course, is that a recent poll showed that the Sweden Democrats who came third in the 2018 Swedish election are now the most popular political party in Sweden.
[3:52:12.300 --> 3:52:30.300]  They, of course, have the strongest anti-mass migration policy. So that is the only thing to come out of this, I guess, as in the UK, where the left-wing pro-open borders, pro-identity politics, pro-climate changes theory, a Labour Party were recently absolutely decimated.
[3:52:30.300 --> 3:52:40.300]  Signs show the same thing could happen in Sweden, but that country is so far gone at this point that it really makes you wonder if it's not too late.
[3:52:40.300 --> 3:52:53.300]  Meanwhile, in Scotland, which is going to probably have another vote to join the EU in terms of an independence outside of the rest of the United Kingdom, sickening and disgusting,
[3:52:53.300 --> 3:53:00.300]  it's okay to be white posters appear in Scottish city because, as we all know, it's not okay to be white.
[3:53:00.300 --> 3:53:10.300]  Police are investigating flyers that appeared in the Scottish city that read it's okay to be white with one member of parliament calling them atrocious.
[3:53:10.300 --> 3:53:16.300]  The posters appeared in Perth city centre and plastered all over lamp posts and drain pipes throughout the city over the weekend.
[3:53:16.300 --> 3:53:31.300]  Somebody sent a message to Perth against racism and said that these posters made them feel unsafe. Literally, a piece of paper with some words on it made them feel unsafe.
[3:53:31.300 --> 3:53:36.300]  The group said it's sickening and disgusting to know that people think like this.
[3:53:36.300 --> 3:53:42.300]  Yes, how dare people think that it's okay to be white. That is sickening and disgusting, isn't it?
[3:53:42.300 --> 3:53:46.300]  Another one said they were worried for their non-white daughters.
[3:53:46.300 --> 3:53:58.300]  John Swinney, a member of the Scottish Parliament, branded the signs atrocious, adding we must stand together to resist this unacceptable material because, again, it's not okay to be white.
[3:53:58.300 --> 3:54:06.300]  No complaints have been made, but the police are going to investigate it anyway because it's rampant hysteria as per usual.
[3:54:06.300 --> 3:54:12.300]  Where did this campaign originate from? Well, of course, we know it originated out of fortune.
[3:54:12.300 --> 3:54:24.300]  They did so in an attempt to bait the media into creating a moral panic and whipping up racial hysteria, which is precisely what happens every single time.
[3:54:24.300 --> 3:54:32.300]  They appear to have been successful every time the posters appear in any city. The media and locals behave as if the Third Reich is about to return.
[3:54:32.300 --> 3:54:46.300]  Again, they've accomplished their goal. Many have commented that the stunt is particularly cunning because it forces the left to adopt the ideologically bigoted view that it isn't okay to be white, thus revealing them to be the actual racist.
[3:54:46.300 --> 3:54:58.300]  So, of course, fortune had a repeat of that stunt on Halloween. People were kicked out of universities in Oklahoma. They had a big case investigating that as a hate crime.
[3:54:58.300 --> 3:55:08.300]  So, every time they try to bait the media and the authorities into overreacting, it happens every single time fortune gets their way.
[3:55:08.300 --> 3:55:18.300]  In Germany, sorry, man fired over, driven by a German sign on bus. Can't say that a bus is driven by a German. That's a hate crime.
[3:55:18.300 --> 3:55:37.300]  This is in Dresden, where a man was fired for displaying a sign that said this bus is steered by a German driver. Basically, what happened is the Dresden Transport Company began hiring a lot of migrant labor to drive these buses because they couldn't source any in the local population.
[3:55:37.300 --> 3:55:55.300]  They hired 19 drivers from Serbia, despite them lacking in German language skills. So, my best guess is that this German bus driver became frustrated with this and he placed this sign on the bus when he was driving it that said this bus is steered by a German driver.
[3:55:55.300 --> 3:56:03.300]  Of course, we can't have that. That is a thought crime. It's a thought crime against diversity and it was swiftly punished.
[3:56:03.300 --> 3:56:13.300]  The bus driver was immediately fired and will probably never be employed by a transport company again. The company said he is no longer on the road. This behavior will have consequences.
[3:56:13.300 --> 3:56:32.300]  Another spokeswoman said that his employment has been terminated. We can under no circumstances tolerate such actions. Presumably, if the driver had been displaying a refugee's welcome sign, nothing would have happened to him and he probably would have been praised as a hero on social media.
[3:56:32.300 --> 3:56:47.300]  In Belgium, meanwhile, migrant population in Ghent doubles in four years because of all the new cultural enriches that have come over since 2015, so I'm sure they've got a lot more of that to look forward to.
[3:56:47.300 --> 3:57:02.300]  Italy, three MS5 lawmakers defect to Salvini's League party. Of course, Matteo Salvini is now out of government, but they're going to have a new election. Pretty soon, given that it's Italy and they have new elections all the time, very unstable political environment,
[3:57:02.300 --> 3:57:17.300]  three senators from the left wing five star movement have left the party to join Salvini's increasingly popular League party. He has the numbers. He's going to be back in government before you know it, whether that is too late for Italy in terms of all the migrant votes coming in.
[3:57:17.300 --> 3:57:36.300]  That remains to be seen. Meanwhile, in Canada, two men fired after using the word Eskimo in a private conversation. Again, they apologize profusely for their politically incorrect speech crime, but they were fired from their labor jobs and they again will probably never be hired again.
