[00:00.000 --> 00:18.000]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:30.000 --> 00:46.000]  It's Thursday, November 11th, 2021.
[00:46.000 --> 00:49.000]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, live in studio.
[00:49.000 --> 00:51.000]  I'm very blessed and honored to be here.
[00:51.000 --> 00:56.000]  Well, every time I think I've seen something so unbelievable
[00:56.000 --> 01:04.000]  that it can't be topped by the globalist worldwide medical tyranny depopulation rollout,
[01:04.000 --> 01:09.000]  the New World Order just does something even more insane.
[01:09.000 --> 01:17.000]  And then by the time that's even covered, something even more horrible unfolds.
[01:17.000 --> 01:27.000]  Yesterday, at about 4.30, I was going to go home early and spend time with my young daughter, wife.
[01:27.000 --> 01:35.000]  And I went in my office and hit refresh on infowars.com.
[01:35.000 --> 01:39.000]  And there was a big article with this headline,
[01:39.000 --> 01:46.000]  FDA document show Pfizer's secretly added heart attack drug to children's COVID vaccines.
[01:46.000 --> 01:51.000]  So then I spent an hour, at least, going through and going to the FDA's own website
[01:51.000 --> 01:59.000]  and indeed seeing that this has now been announced 10 days before and it got no coverage.
[01:59.000 --> 02:04.000]  Alex Jones didn't know about it for 10 days.
[02:04.000 --> 02:09.000]  And I sent the documents off to other prominent talk show hosts, they hadn't heard of it.
[02:09.000 --> 02:15.000]  That's how high level the censor is because they're worse than medical doctors and scientists in news sites
[02:15.000 --> 02:18.000]  that did report on it eight days ago.
[02:18.000 --> 02:21.000]  It broke 12 days ago.
[02:21.000 --> 02:23.000]  That is just so incredible.
[02:23.000 --> 02:30.000]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, do you realize how illegal that is?
[02:30.000 --> 02:35.000]  It's one thing to have them say, oh, they've approved an experimental shot.
[02:35.000 --> 02:37.000]  And that, of course, was illegal.
[02:37.000 --> 02:45.000]  Now they add a very strong heart attack drug that you give somebody once they've had a heart attack
[02:45.000 --> 02:53.000]  to stabilize the heart that has horrible side effects and is extremely strong and extremely toxic.
[02:53.000 --> 02:59.000]  And so then I had a couple more hours research and it turned out that Rob Dude knew about this six days ago.
[02:59.000 --> 03:01.000]  I'm not mad at Rob.
[03:01.000 --> 03:07.000]  We're so punch-drunk to this evil that, oh, they added a heart attack drug secretly to the shot and didn't tell anybody.
[03:07.000 --> 03:10.000]  And now they just buried it in an FDA announcement.
[03:10.000 --> 03:16.000]  And 12 days later, Alex Jones doesn't know about it or 11 days later last night.
[03:16.000 --> 03:19.000]  I mean, we could talk for the next four hours just about that.
[03:19.000 --> 03:23.000]  And I've got stuff just as horrible, just as crazy.
[03:23.000 --> 03:28.000]  Australia has now announced that they're going to declare martial law around Christmas
[03:28.000 --> 03:31.000]  and anyone that doesn't take injections is locked in their house.
[03:31.000 --> 03:33.000]  And they say, then if you go bankrupt, that's fine.
[03:33.000 --> 03:34.000]  You're going to be put in a camp.
[03:34.000 --> 03:35.000]  That's been announced.
[03:35.000 --> 03:39.000]  I have mainstream news here, reporting it like it's a good thing.
[03:39.000 --> 03:46.000]  Associated Press, Australian leaders says lockdown for unvaccinated is likely.
[03:46.000 --> 03:48.000]  They say, we're going to make it very uncomfortable for you.
[03:48.000 --> 03:50.000]  We're going to take your house.
[03:50.000 --> 03:55.000]  And then it gets crazier because do you know what just happened last night?
[03:55.000 --> 04:03.000]  The fourth European country in a week banned the Moderna shot in under 30s because of the massive heart attack
[04:03.000 --> 04:07.000]  and myocarditis issues and blood clots.
[04:07.000 --> 04:11.000]  At least a 15-fold increase.
[04:11.000 --> 04:14.000]  I had to watch them on CNN last night trying to spend it.
[04:14.000 --> 04:15.000]  I saw the clip this morning.
[04:15.000 --> 04:18.000]  It was Anderson Cooper like, well, that's not that common.
[04:18.000 --> 04:22.000]  I mean, it's 15 times increase.
[04:22.000 --> 04:25.000]  And so now Germany has banned it.
[04:25.000 --> 04:29.000]  And a bunch of countries have banned the Pfizer too, India, China, you name it.
[04:29.000 --> 04:34.000]  So they're trying to give and are giving five-year-olds, evil brainwashed parents are running out as well,
[04:34.000 --> 04:39.000]  and injecting their five-year-olds with something that embraces their immune system
[04:39.000 --> 04:44.000]  and can give them cancer, blood clots and heart attacks.
[04:44.000 --> 04:46.000]  I mean, wow.
[04:46.000 --> 04:48.000]  And it just gets more insane.
[04:48.000 --> 04:52.000]  And remember, everything you see in Australia and Europe is coming here next.
[04:52.000 --> 04:55.000]  They're getting ready for martial law in Canada as well.
[04:55.000 --> 04:59.000]  This is the takeover, folks, by the UN.
[04:59.000 --> 05:22.000]  Well, it's now out in the open that the new world...

[06:04.000 --> 06:08.000]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[06:09.000 --> 06:11.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[06:11.000 --> 06:31.000]  In the 21st century, war is carried up by covert means under the shroud, under the cover of medical necessity.
[06:32.000 --> 06:37.000]  Here we are living in such a historic and incredibly dangerous time.
[06:37.000 --> 06:42.000]  Well, here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[06:43.000 --> 06:44.000]  Tromethamine.
[06:45.000 --> 06:46.000]  Tromethamine.
[06:47.000 --> 06:48.000]  Tromethamine.
[06:49.000 --> 06:50.000]  Tromethamine.
[06:50.000 --> 07:16.000]  Tromethamine. That's what was announced 12 days ago in a FDA posting on their site about their emergency authorization for five and ups of the experimental Pfizer injection.
[07:16.000 --> 07:25.000]  Which they then said was approved under a drug name that is approved in the year 2026, four plus years from now.
[07:29.000 --> 07:38.000]  And I'm going to show you for TV viewers. That's why I started simulcasting my radio show more than 20 years ago on TV because people wouldn't believe me when I just told them I had a document.
[07:38.000 --> 07:47.000]  So here I can show it to you. It's all linked up on infowars.com. We've got a link in the live show feed to the FDA document to our articles that have the links.
[07:49.000 --> 07:57.000]  But if you look right here, if you're a TV viewer, you see this? That's the FDA document at FDA.gov. You see that right there?
[07:57.000 --> 08:08.000]  And this is the equivalent of reading the menu list for Cyclone B in the German death camps.
[08:10.000 --> 08:18.000]  Now this is a very dangerous drug. It's a very toxic drug.
[08:18.000 --> 08:26.000]  And I wondered why two weeks ago they suddenly authorized it for five and ups and that was on the news.
[08:27.000 --> 08:33.000]  We said, oh look, there's more heart attacks in children. They just authorized this toxic drug for when children have heart attacks and myocarditis.
[08:34.000 --> 08:45.000]  Not knowing that they had just quietly slipped it in there, that they're putting it as the quote base in the Pfizer shot.
[08:45.000 --> 08:57.000]  No longer is the Pfizer shot for children going to be in a saline salt solution like most drugs you inject, all vaccines, even the nasals in a saline solution.
[09:01.000 --> 09:09.000]  But a very toxic heart attack drug that you only take when someone's dying of a heart attack because it has so many bad side effects.
[09:09.000 --> 09:19.000]  And the dose I looked it up is a very toxic near fatal dose in children of the drug, which could actually make them have a heart attack.
[09:20.000 --> 09:26.000]  I mean, folks, they might start putting cyanide in there on TV and kids might start dropping dead by the thousands and the news will say it's good.
[09:27.000 --> 09:36.000]  I mean, we're entering that territory. This is psycho behavioral psychologists running all this to just see how many of us they can kill and normalizing this.
[09:36.000 --> 09:46.000]  They're normalizing it. Because, you know, the Germans could argue they didn't know about death camps and things and Eisenhower made them go into tears of it and look at it for themselves in famous film footage.
[09:49.000 --> 09:58.000]  But here we know it's a death camp. We know it's a slow kill. We know it stays in the body for 15 months at least and causes all sorts of cardiovascular problems from the vaccine.
[09:58.000 --> 10:07.000]  But now they just go, oh, we're not going to have the Pfizer shot based on saline for children. It's going to be a heart attack drug.
[10:10.000 --> 10:16.000]  Wow. And then there's no coverage of it, except a legal notice. Oh, it's authorized in children now.
[10:17.000 --> 10:22.000]  Why not? They emergency authorized these mRNAs. Why not some heart attack medicine for your child?
[10:22.000 --> 10:27.000]  Holy Frankenstein.
[10:30.000 --> 10:37.000]  Now, when I started calling people about this last night, they thought I was joking, prominent people saying, hey, you got to see this.
[10:38.000 --> 10:43.000]  And when they saw it was actually an FDA website, they basically crap themselves and so did I.
[10:43.000 --> 10:51.000]  So I shot a report about it last night with Rob do we were up here till eight and I was pretty excited in the video. I saw complaints. I was interrupting Rob during it.
[10:52.000 --> 10:58.000]  Yeah, I'm upset. They're killing kids. Yeah, I'm upset in the video. Why don't you worry about other killing kids or go do your own video exposing it.
[10:59.000 --> 11:02.000]  And my point is, is that we're in a damn war.
[11:03.000 --> 11:08.000]  Doesn't matter how my delivery is. In fact, the I mean, I don't know. I just can't sit here on air and just talk about this.
[11:08.000 --> 11:12.000]  I'm not going to do anything violent like they're doing to our children because they'll use that against us.
[11:13.000 --> 11:16.000]  But they deserve to be held accountable. I mean, they are attacking us.
[11:17.000 --> 11:25.000]  If a crazy man showed up at your house with a needle full of cyanide or a needle full of Drano and tried to inject you, you would have a right.
[11:26.000 --> 11:28.000]  You would have a duty to protect yourself and your children.
[11:28.000 --> 11:36.000]  And Fauci is this well known crazy madman. But but but here's the thing. I'm going to get to this at the bottom of the hour.
[11:37.000 --> 11:38.000]  That's just one thing here.
[11:40.000 --> 11:42.000]  This is over the top.
[11:43.000 --> 11:48.000]  The fact that no one even knows about it. The fact that happened 12 days ago. The fact that it's it's all right here.
[11:49.000 --> 11:56.000]  The fact that has all these horrible side effects. It says you must inject it into someone's vein to go directly into the heart.
[11:56.000 --> 12:02.000]  Or it can kill someone. That's the main indication.
[12:03.000 --> 12:11.000]  It's a contra indication is, you know, doing the opposite. And they say, inject it into the muscle of the child.
[12:13.000 --> 12:18.000]  And it says in the literature that will necrose the arm. It'll eat a hole in them.
[12:19.000 --> 12:20.000]  It liquefies you.
[12:20.000 --> 12:26.000]  So this is designed to be injected into a vein. So it goes into the heart.
[12:27.000 --> 12:34.000]  That's the closest thing to the hearts of vain because it's going into the heart to get oxygenated. It's supposed to go into a vein, not into an artery.
[12:35.000 --> 12:41.000]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, I'm not even a doctor, but I called doctors about this last night and they didn't even know about this.
[12:41.000 --> 12:53.000]  I mean, wow, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa is you that goes along with this.
[12:54.000 --> 12:58.000]  They've made a psychotic attack on him. I mean, now it's totally confirmed.
[12:59.000 --> 13:05.000]  And remember what the FDA doctor said. He goes, I'm voting to approve this because we don't know what this is going to do.
[13:06.000 --> 13:08.000]  We have to test it on the general public. Test it on children.
[13:08.000 --> 13:12.000]  Yeah, I don't go get a guinea pig or a rat because they already did secret tests. I know it does to them.
[13:13.000 --> 13:15.000]  It gives them blood clots and kills them. So let's just do it to the children.
[13:16.000 --> 13:23.000]  I mean, when you see these guys, these are psycho freaks paid off by the system on TV, literally killing children.
[13:24.000 --> 13:27.000]  And they're financing moves to shut us all down and ban us.
[13:28.000 --> 13:31.000]  And the head of Pfizer says he wants everybody criticizing him arrested.
[13:31.000 --> 13:41.000]  Okay, I'm going to cover all this and then show you the actual FDA document right here in my hand at the bottom of the hour.
[13:42.000 --> 13:44.000]  Okay. And all the side effects and everything else.
[13:45.000 --> 13:47.000]  So everybody, you know, friends, family, tell them to an end.
[13:48.000 --> 13:52.000]  And now we've got the former head of Planned Parenthood who wants to guess kill kids after they're out of the womb,
[13:53.000 --> 13:57.000]  saying, yeah, with the Anderson Cooper, it's okay, you got a 15 times increase in myocarditis and heart attacks.
[13:57.000 --> 14:01.000]  That's no big deal. And they're on TV like it's no big deal 15 time increase in heart attacks.
[14:02.000 --> 14:07.000]  No big deal. Just gaslighting. Well, it's no big deal 15 time increase in this.
[14:09.000 --> 14:15.000]  Oh, but they just are banning these vaccines, these deadly injections all over the world, including Europe, Germany.
[14:16.000 --> 14:19.000]  But, but, oh, you're, but see America is targeted for total destruction.
[14:20.000 --> 14:22.000]  And then here's the rest of it.
[14:22.000 --> 14:26.000]  This is the Associated Press. We have the video of this. It's chilling.
[14:27.000 --> 14:31.000]  Australian leader says lockdown for the vaccinated is likely.
[14:32.000 --> 14:38.000]  It's the Australian Chancellor. That's the leader of their parliament and said that we will lock you in your house.
[14:39.000 --> 14:44.000]  And then once you go bankrupt, we will then take you to a camp actually says camps all happening.
[14:47.000 --> 14:50.000]  Germany hits record new COVID cases of 24 hours.
[14:50.000 --> 14:57.000]  Even though they're totally locked down, Germany and France restrict Moderna COVID vaccine for under 30s over rare heart risk.
[14:58.000 --> 14:59.000]  Yeah, it's not rare.
[15:00.000 --> 15:04.000]  Taiwan halts second dose of Pfizer after deaths and heart attacks in young people.
[15:05.000 --> 15:07.000]  Oh, yeah, that's out of the news over there.
[15:08.000 --> 15:12.000]  But you won't be hearing that anywhere on our news, ladies and gentlemen.
[15:13.000 --> 15:15.000]  And that's just the tip of the iceberg.
[15:15.000 --> 15:19.000]  It gets crazier and crazier and crazier.
[15:20.000 --> 15:21.000]  And then I've got Klaus Schwab's new announcement.
[15:22.000 --> 15:24.000]  Oh, he's got a new initiative.
[15:25.000 --> 15:26.000]  You heard a build back better in the great reset.
[15:27.000 --> 15:29.000]  Well, he's set to announce tomorrow.
[15:30.000 --> 15:33.000]  We're going to cover it live during the show, something new for you.
[15:34.000 --> 15:39.000]  And as soon as he says it, you'll see every globalist and every leftist parrot it like an obedient parrot.
[15:39.000 --> 15:43.000]  And we happen to know what he's going to announce tomorrow.
[15:44.000 --> 15:45.000]  So you want tomorrow's news today?

[17:11.000 --> 17:14.000]  And listen, it's not just concentrated chicken broth.
[17:15.000 --> 17:17.000]  It's so good for your joints and your bones and your whole body.
[17:18.000 --> 17:25.000]  It's got really strong high-end turmeric root, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder,
[17:25.000 --> 17:31.000]  and a bunch of other stuff in it, like real organic cocoa, bean powder with natural chocolate flavor,
[17:32.000 --> 17:34.000]  and a touch of sea salt, and just on and on and on.
[17:35.000 --> 17:36.000]  Magnesium, potassium's added.
[17:37.000 --> 17:40.000]  This is so good for inflammation, for your immune system, for your whole body.
[17:41.000 --> 17:43.000]  Grandma always gave you chicken soup when you were sick.
[17:44.000 --> 17:49.000]  Remember, that's a tiny amount of the same stuff that's in there that is now in here in a very large amount.
[17:49.000 --> 17:54.000]  So again, get the power of Grandma's chicken soup with the power of turmeric and everything else
[17:55.000 --> 17:58.000]  with the new and improved Bone Broth at infowarsstore.com.

[20:02.000 --> 20:05.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:05.000 --> 20:31.000]  All right, my friends, let's go back 10 months ago when I was ranting and raving on air
[20:31.000 --> 20:35.000]  about what we would be living under very soon in the great reset
[20:36.000 --> 20:39.000]  and the fact that the global lockdown was just beginning, not ending,
[20:40.000 --> 20:45.000]  as they now announce in Europe, Australia, Canada, more lockdowns including permanent lockdowns
[20:46.000 --> 20:49.000]  of those that are, quote, unvaccinated and then they catch any friends or family visiting,
[20:50.000 --> 20:51.000]  you'll be taken to a camp.
[20:53.000 --> 20:54.000]  That's how they make it sound reasonable.
[20:55.000 --> 20:56.000]  Oh, you won't go to the camp unless you have visitors.
[20:57.000 --> 20:59.000]  Oh, but once you don't have a job, we're going to take your house.
[20:59.000 --> 21:01.000]  So you'll have to live in a camp.
[21:02.000 --> 21:03.000]  This is being announced by the Associated Press.
[21:04.000 --> 21:08.000]  There's a video of the head of their parliament, their chancellor saying it in Australia.
[21:09.000 --> 21:10.000]  That's all UN run.
[21:11.000 --> 21:12.000]  This is the system they're bringing here.
[21:13.000 --> 21:14.000]  It's all from the UN.
[21:17.000 --> 21:19.000]  And then I've got just incredible news here.
[21:21.000 --> 21:23.000]  Dealing with this, but look at this headline on infowars.com.
[21:23.000 --> 21:28.000]  Germany's latest EU government to warn young adults, pregnant women to avoid the Moderna jab.
[21:29.000 --> 21:36.000]  The Moderna jab works exactly the same as the Pfizer shot.
[21:37.000 --> 21:38.000]  It's the same thing I've had scientists on.
[21:39.000 --> 21:42.000]  I've read the literature myself, except it's three times stronger.
[21:43.000 --> 21:48.000]  Remember Bill Gates said like 20 months ago, we'll have a new vaccine, but it's got to be really strong.
[21:48.000 --> 21:52.000]  So yeah, 80% do, you know, have bad reactions.
[21:53.000 --> 21:54.000]  Remember on NBC, not going to play it again.
[21:55.000 --> 21:56.000]  I've probably played it a hundred times.
[21:57.000 --> 21:58.000]  Seriously.
[21:59.000 --> 21:59.000]  Yeah.
[22:00.000 --> 22:00.000]  Yeah.
[22:01.000 --> 22:05.000]  The Moderna is super bad news, but there you go.
[22:06.000 --> 22:08.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's the good cop, bad cop.
[22:09.000 --> 22:09.000]  Okay.
[22:10.000 --> 22:10.000]  People are getting sick.
[22:11.000 --> 22:12.000]  We'll stop having the Moderna one.
[22:13.000 --> 22:16.000]  Here you can take this one, but there'll be lots of booster shots that do the same damn thing.
[22:16.000 --> 22:20.000]  Oh, I got big news out of Israel too.
[22:21.000 --> 22:25.000]  There, there, everything you see in Australia and Israel is what's coming here next.
[22:26.000 --> 22:27.000]  That's why that's so important.
[22:28.000 --> 22:31.000]  They've now announced that they're preparing for total permanent martial law for the next variant.
[22:32.000 --> 22:36.000]  They're saying COVID's permanent and they'll be a sixth shot, a sixth shot.
[22:37.000 --> 22:38.000]  And oh, it's going to be reformulated.
[22:39.000 --> 22:41.000]  Oh, so the five shots don't work.
[22:42.000 --> 22:43.000]  Then the six shots, a new variant.
[22:43.000 --> 22:47.000]  Oh, and then you'll need five or six more shots and then it just continues on forever.
[22:48.000 --> 22:50.000]  They're holding war games on how to make you do it.
[22:51.000 --> 22:52.000]  That's all coming up.
[22:53.000 --> 22:56.000]  But, but, but first here I am 10 months ago because this is going viral again and it's important.
[22:57.000 --> 23:00.000]  It sounds very negative, but it's really what's happening and only admitting that this is happening.
[23:01.000 --> 23:02.000]  If there's any chance of turning this around, here it is.
[23:03.000 --> 23:06.000]  I mean, you understand, folks, I believe they're going to shut everything down the next few months.
[23:07.000 --> 23:08.000]  They're going to blow up federal buildings.
[23:09.000 --> 23:10.000]  They're going to put poison in water supplies.
[23:11.000 --> 23:11.000]  I mean, it's over.
[23:11.000 --> 23:12.000]  I mean, you're, it's over.
[23:13.000 --> 23:16.000]  You understand your only shot you've got is realizing that we're screwed.
[23:17.000 --> 23:18.000]  You're candy-ass church isn't going to do it.
[23:19.000 --> 23:20.000]  You're candy-ass Boston going to do it.
[23:21.000 --> 23:23.000]  We're a trained group of monkeys in this country.
[23:24.000 --> 23:25.000]  We're not what Americans used to be.
[23:26.000 --> 23:27.000]  We're not rugged individualists.
[23:28.000 --> 23:29.000]  We don't stand up for the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[23:30.000 --> 23:30.000]  We're a joke.
[23:31.000 --> 23:31.000]  Okay.
[23:32.000 --> 23:37.000]  And so they got people like Brian Stelzer up there saying shut down all of his competition on TV now.
[23:38.000 --> 23:39.000]  He thinks he owns you.
[23:39.000 --> 23:40.000]  Jeff Sucker thinks he owns you.
[23:41.000 --> 23:42.000]  These are bad people.
[23:43.000 --> 23:43.000]  Okay.
[23:44.000 --> 23:45.000]  So I've done the best job I can.
[23:46.000 --> 23:47.000]  I'm not bitching at the crew or you or anybody.
[23:48.000 --> 23:49.000]  I'm just saying it's hard for me to get up here and do a normal show.
[23:50.000 --> 23:51.000]  When we have a group of corporate criminals literally gang-raping us.
[23:52.000 --> 23:53.000]  I mean, if we ever beat this thing, it'll be in the history of like these people were Hitler.
[23:54.000 --> 23:55.000]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[23:56.000 --> 23:57.000]  It's not like, oh, we're getting out of here.
[23:58.000 --> 23:59.000]  We're getting out of here.
[24:00.000 --> 24:01.000]  We're getting out of here.
[24:02.000 --> 24:03.000]  We're getting out of here.
[24:04.000 --> 24:05.000]  We're getting out of here.
[24:06.000 --> 24:07.000]  We're getting out of here.
[24:07.000 --> 24:08.000]  Unbelievable.
[24:09.000 --> 24:10.000]  It's not like, oh, we're getting there.
[24:11.000 --> 24:12.000]  It's bad.
[24:13.000 --> 24:14.000]  Things are out of control.
[24:15.000 --> 24:16.000]  It's, it's, they just begun.
[24:17.000 --> 24:18.000]  They're going to take your pension funds.
[24:19.000 --> 24:20.000]  They're going to bankrupt.
[24:21.000 --> 24:22.000]  They're going to cut the power off the oil off.
[24:23.000 --> 24:24.000]  They're going to open the borders.
[24:25.000 --> 24:26.000]  It's over, man.
[24:27.000 --> 24:28.000]  It's over.
[24:29.000 --> 24:30.000]  It's all gone.
[24:31.000 --> 24:32.000]  It's all over.
[24:33.000 --> 24:34.000]  They're going to activate the Boogaloo's FBI ADL terror forces.
[24:34.000 --> 24:36.000]  They want you starving in the street.
[24:37.000 --> 24:38.000]  They want to rape your wife.
[24:39.000 --> 24:40.000]  They're Bolsheviks.
[24:41.000 --> 24:42.000]  They're Jacobins.
[24:43.000 --> 24:44.000]  It's all over, man.
[24:45.000 --> 24:46.000]  All over.
[24:47.000 --> 24:48.000]  Enjoy.
[24:49.000 --> 24:50.000]  All your games.
[24:51.000 --> 24:52.000]  In fact, America is rotting and deserves it.
[24:53.000 --> 24:54.000]  Now, the Satanists aren't good.
[24:55.000 --> 24:56.000]  They're not God.
[24:57.000 --> 24:58.000]  God just lets them have their way now.
[24:59.000 --> 25:00.000]  So all your games are over.
[25:01.000 --> 25:02.000]  All the TV watching, all the laziness,
[25:02.000 --> 25:03.000]  all your games are over.
[25:04.000 --> 25:05.000]  You're going to be just like a baby
[25:06.000 --> 25:07.000]  at six months being chopped up in its mother's womb.
[25:08.000 --> 25:09.000]  You're not a human.
[25:10.000 --> 25:11.000]  You're not essential.
[25:12.000 --> 25:13.000]  You're dead.
[25:14.000 --> 25:15.000]  They're going to kill you because you don't care.
[25:16.000 --> 25:17.000]  And that's where they'd like to take you
[25:18.000 --> 25:19.000]  if you put up with it.
[25:20.000 --> 25:21.000]  And they intend to do it by increments.
[25:22.000 --> 25:23.000]  So here's the new article from RT.
[25:24.000 --> 25:25.000]  It's on infowars.com.
[25:26.000 --> 25:27.000]  DHS claims COVID restrictions
[25:28.000 --> 25:29.000]  and arrival of Afghans could fuel domestic terror.
[25:29.000 --> 25:30.000]  The official terror policy
[25:31.000 --> 25:32.000]  is that anti-vaxxers are terrorists
[25:34.000 --> 25:35.000]  and are going to start blowing things up.
[25:36.000 --> 25:37.000]  They said that when he got into office
[25:38.000 --> 25:39.000]  by fraud in January
[25:40.000 --> 25:41.000]  and their first press conference
[25:42.000 --> 25:43.000]  with James Saki.
[25:44.000 --> 25:45.000]  And then they said it again
[25:46.000 --> 25:47.000]  with the top generals at the Joint Chiefs of Staff
[25:48.000 --> 25:49.000]  for the first time ever in U.S. history
[25:50.000 --> 25:51.000]  denouncing that they're prepared
[25:52.000 --> 25:53.000]  for war with the American people.
[25:54.000 --> 25:55.000]  Totally illegal.
[25:56.000 --> 25:57.000]  Then in June, they changed the law
[25:57.000 --> 25:58.000]  and he issued the executive orders
[26:01.000 --> 26:02.000]  to say the American people
[26:03.000 --> 26:04.000]  are the main terror threat
[26:05.000 --> 26:06.000]  for not wanting lockdowns
[26:07.000 --> 26:08.000]  and or questioning the election.
[26:09.000 --> 26:10.000]  And here it is.
[26:11.000 --> 26:12.000]  DHS claims COVID restrictions
[26:13.000 --> 26:14.000]  and arrival of Afghans
[26:15.000 --> 26:16.000]  could fuel domestic terrorism
[26:17.000 --> 26:18.000]  because they know the Islamics.
[26:19.000 --> 26:20.000]  They brought in a bunch of Islamics.
[26:21.000 --> 26:22.000]  They know they'll probably blow something up.
[26:23.000 --> 26:24.000]  So they're kind of mixing that in there.
[26:24.000 --> 26:26.000]  He said, oh my gosh, I'm talking to the FBI and CIA.
[26:27.000 --> 26:28.000]  There's these dark actors that are lying
[26:29.000 --> 26:30.000]  to people about the shots
[26:31.000 --> 26:32.000]  and they're bad and we got to get them.
[26:33.000 --> 26:34.000]  They need to be arrested.
[26:35.000 --> 26:36.000]  They're criminals.
[26:37.000 --> 26:38.000]  He said, they're criminals, yes.
[26:39.000 --> 26:40.000]  No, you're the criminal.
[26:41.000 --> 26:42.000]  You're the criminal.
[26:43.000 --> 26:44.000]  You paid off the politicians
[26:45.000 --> 26:46.000]  and bought up the health departments in the West
[26:47.000 --> 26:48.000]  and put this poison on us that you know damn well
[26:49.000 --> 26:50.000]  destroys the immune system
[26:51.000 --> 26:52.000]  and causes all these heart attacks
[26:52.000 --> 26:54.000]  or mass shooting at a vaccine facility
[26:55.000 --> 26:56.000]  or an attack on one of these guys or Fauci.
[26:57.000 --> 26:58.000]  99% chance they did it
[27:01.000 --> 27:02.000]  and then they're going to blame it on us
[27:03.000 --> 27:04.000]  because that's how they operate.
[27:05.000 --> 27:06.000]  That's the next thing they're going to do
[27:07.000 --> 27:08.000]  and they're so pissed that Tucker Carlson
[27:09.000 --> 27:10.000]  exposed January 6th as an inside job.
[27:11.000 --> 27:12.000]  They're so mad that we're getting people
[27:13.000 --> 27:14.000]  to think about this and know what's coming.
[27:15.000 --> 27:16.000]  And I told you a year and a half ago
[27:17.000 --> 27:18.000]  they're going to stage terror attacks
[27:19.000 --> 27:20.000]  on the anti-vaxxers under martial law.
[27:20.000 --> 27:21.000]  We don't want to die.
[27:22.000 --> 27:23.000]  We don't want to get shot with the poison
[27:24.000 --> 27:25.000]  so we get shot with the bullets.
[27:26.000 --> 27:27.000]  This is very, very simple.
[27:28.000 --> 27:29.000]  This has been done in Africa and Latin America
[27:30.000 --> 27:31.000]  and Asia where they come in and inject people
[27:32.000 --> 27:33.000]  and a year later half the village is dead.
[27:34.000 --> 27:35.000]  The next time people run when they see
[27:36.000 --> 27:37.000]  the UN trucks coming, run by Tedris.
[27:38.000 --> 27:40.000]  Then they use helicopters and just take them out.
[27:41.000 --> 27:42.000]  They even have New York Times articles about
[27:43.000 --> 27:44.000]  oh, these villagers wouldn't turn on their land
[27:45.000 --> 27:46.000]  to a carbon sink and did not follow the UN directive
[27:47.000 --> 27:48.000]  so 10,000 were killed by UN forces.
[27:48.000 --> 27:49.000]  Just foot, foot, no.
[27:50.000 --> 27:51.000]  Just line them up, shoot them.
[27:52.000 --> 27:53.000]  Then as that collapses they all run and flee here.
[27:54.000 --> 27:55.000]  Soros gives them a $3,000 debit card
[27:56.000 --> 27:59.000]  and literally there's now like 5 million refugees
[28:00.000 --> 28:01.000]  from the Caribbean and Africa already in the U.S.
[28:02.000 --> 28:03.000]  in the first 10 months of this year.
[28:04.000 --> 28:05.000]  Oh yeah, folks.
[28:06.000 --> 28:07.000]  The war patrol real numbers are as of October
[28:08.000 --> 28:09.000]  10 million people already got into the U.S.
[28:10.000 --> 28:11.000]  It wasn't 2 million or 3 million.
[28:12.000 --> 28:13.000]  10 million.
[28:14.000 --> 28:15.000]  10 million.
[28:15.000 --> 28:17.000]  And the UN says that's just the start.
[28:18.000 --> 28:21.000]  By 2050, 640 million people are going to be brought here
[28:22.000 --> 28:24.000]  as, quote, replacement migration from the third world.
[28:25.000 --> 28:27.000]  Exporting the third world here to capture us
[28:28.000 --> 28:29.000]  under UN control.
[28:30.000 --> 28:31.000]  And where are the governors?
[28:32.000 --> 28:33.000]  Where are the legislatures?
[28:34.000 --> 28:35.000]  Where are the leaders telling you you're in a war
[28:36.000 --> 28:37.000]  under the Great Reset?
[28:38.000 --> 28:39.000]  I'll tell you about it when we come back
[28:40.000 --> 28:42.000]  but first I'm going to hit the very extreme
[28:42.000 --> 28:44.000]  poisonous, only use an emergency,
[28:45.000 --> 28:47.000]  only break glass when someone's having a horrible heart attack,
[28:48.000 --> 28:51.000]  drug being added with no fanfare or coverage
[28:52.000 --> 28:53.000]  to the children's Pfizer shots.
[28:54.000 --> 28:55.000]  That's right. Stay with us.
[29:03.000 --> 29:05.000]  It's now becoming accepted knowledge.
[29:06.000 --> 29:09.000]  Accepted fact that global government run by private corporations
[29:09.000 --> 29:11.000]  is taking over the United States
[29:12.000 --> 29:13.000]  and other formerly sovereign nations.
[29:14.000 --> 29:15.000]  They're being destroyed.
[29:16.000 --> 29:17.000]  All the checks and balances are being annihilated.
[29:18.000 --> 29:19.000]  Our borders are being destroyed.
[29:20.000 --> 29:21.000]  Our currency is being destroyed.
[29:22.000 --> 29:23.000]  And the American people have been listed as terrorists
[29:24.000 --> 29:25.000]  by the rogue federal government.
[29:26.000 --> 29:27.000]  Info wars is going to continue to fight on
[29:28.000 --> 29:29.000]  and there is a big awakening happening.
[29:30.000 --> 29:31.000]  We have a good chance of beating these people
[29:32.000 --> 29:33.000]  but we're not going to be able to stay on air
[29:34.000 --> 29:35.000]  unless you support us and you've been doing it.
[29:36.000 --> 29:37.000]  So spread the word about the broadcast,
[29:37.000 --> 29:38.000]  we have great products at infowarstore.com.
[29:39.000 --> 29:40.000]  If you're shopping with the big corporations
[29:41.000 --> 29:42.000]  or the establishment, you're aiding the enemy.
[29:43.000 --> 29:44.000]  If you're funding us and getting great products,
[29:45.000 --> 29:47.000]  you are helping lead the war effort.

[30:02.000 --> 30:03.000]  we put in info wars live products
[30:04.000 --> 30:05.000]  and that's why for more than two years
[30:05.000 --> 30:06.000]  we've sold out of Ultimate Bone Broth
[30:07.000 --> 30:09.000]  and we could never get the ingredients again
[30:10.000 --> 30:11.000]  until now and we have reformulated
[30:12.000 --> 30:13.000]  and not just used the same ingredients,
[30:14.000 --> 30:16.000]  we've boosted it and made them even stronger.
[30:17.000 --> 30:18.000]  So out of all the bone broths out there,
[30:19.000 --> 30:20.000]  I'm telling you this is next level.
[30:21.000 --> 30:22.000]  Listen to what it's got in it.

[32:56.000 --> 32:57.000]  I recommend you get your Christmas shopping done now
[32:58.000 --> 32:59.000]  and have it done and support the info war
[32:59.000 --> 33:26.000] .
[33:26.000 --> 33:28.000]  All right, my friends, remember,
[33:29.000 --> 33:30.000]  the British Medical Journal came out
[33:31.000 --> 33:32.000]  two weeks ago and said they'd looked
[33:33.000 --> 33:34.000]  at data from the whistleblower
[33:35.000 --> 33:36.000]  that had worked in the Pfizer
[33:37.000 --> 33:38.000]  trials that have been going on
[33:39.000 --> 33:40.000]  with the rollout in the last year
[33:41.000 --> 33:42.000]  in the U.S. here in Texas.
[33:43.000 --> 33:45.000]  And then indeed they had suppressed illnesses
[33:46.000 --> 33:47.000]  and death.
[33:48.000 --> 33:49.000]  That is back in the news today.
[33:50.000 --> 33:52.000]  There's more from the British Medical Journal
[33:53.000 --> 33:54.000]  on that. We'll be getting to it.
[33:54.000 --> 33:56.000]  So if you just tuned in, I'm begging you
[33:57.000 --> 33:58.000]  to understand that the enemy is suppressing
[33:59.000 --> 34:00.000]  all this information across big tech.
[34:01.000 --> 34:02.000]  No one's talking about this on mainline
[34:03.000 --> 34:04.000]  talk radio.
[34:05.000 --> 34:06.000]  Our job here at info wars, your job,
[34:07.000 --> 34:08.000]  if you care, and I know you do,
[34:09.000 --> 34:10.000]  is to force this information out
[34:11.000 --> 34:12.000]  and to punch a hole through
[34:13.000 --> 34:14.000]  the electronic Berlin Wall,
[34:15.000 --> 34:16.000]  the iron curtain of censorship.
[34:18.000 --> 34:19.000]  You have to like a laser beam help me
[34:21.000 --> 34:22.000]  to understand that the enemy
[34:22.000 --> 34:23.000]  you have to like a laser beam
[34:24.000 --> 34:25.000]  help me, help yourself,
[34:26.000 --> 34:27.000]  help all of us get this out
[34:28.000 --> 34:29.000]  and the power of the millions
[34:30.000 --> 34:31.000]  of people listening.
[34:32.000 --> 34:33.000]  Live right now or later,
[34:34.000 --> 34:35.000]  this will be archived at man.video
[34:36.000 --> 34:37.000]  to take this information
[34:38.000 --> 34:39.000]  and to share it with everyone you know
[34:40.000 --> 34:41.000]  and to call people up and say,
[34:42.000 --> 34:43.000]  hey, I'm going to send you this via email
[34:44.000 --> 34:45.000]  or I'm going to text this to you.
[34:46.000 --> 34:47.000]  You need to watch this.
[34:48.000 --> 34:49.000]  And all the great viewers and people,
[34:49.000 --> 34:51.000]  they edit them and take clips out
[34:52.000 --> 34:53.000]  and take the best parts you think
[34:54.000 --> 34:55.000]  and put them on Twitter, put them
[34:56.000 --> 34:57.000]  on Facebook, put them on Instagram.
[34:58.000 --> 34:59.000]  Who cares if you get censored or banned?
[35:00.000 --> 35:01.000]  This is war and they can't stop everybody.
[35:03.000 --> 35:04.000]  Bottom line, you've got to take the
[35:05.000 --> 35:06.000]  live show feed.
[35:07.000 --> 35:08.000]  You've got to take the archive.
[35:09.000 --> 35:10.000]  You can share those via email
[35:11.000 --> 35:12.000]  and text message or word of mouth
[35:13.000 --> 35:14.000]  or call your employees in at lunch
[35:15.000 --> 35:16.000]  if you're the boss and say, listen,
[35:16.000 --> 35:18.000]  a lot of you probably heard in Fort Worth.com
[35:19.000 --> 35:20.000]  has been demonized.
[35:21.000 --> 35:22.000]  That's because the bad guys
[35:23.000 --> 35:24.000]  want to silence the information there,
[35:25.000 --> 35:26.000]  but this is real information.
[35:27.000 --> 35:28.000]  And again, I don't care other news
[35:29.000 --> 35:30.000]  people, other folks.
[35:31.000 --> 35:32.000]  We don't want credit.
[35:33.000 --> 35:34.000]  We don't care about who got it out
[35:35.000 --> 35:36.000]  there and got people covering it.
[35:37.000 --> 35:38.000]  The fact that I didn't know about this
[35:39.000 --> 35:40.000]  for 12 days and that it was reported
[35:41.000 --> 35:42.000]  on a few little sites and that some
[35:43.000 --> 35:44.000]  of my crew knew about it a week ago
[35:44.000 --> 35:45.000]  where we're so used to being assaulted,
[35:46.000 --> 35:47.000]  so used to being attacked that when
[35:48.000 --> 35:49.000]  the British Medical Journal confirms
[35:50.000 --> 35:51.000]  massive increases in heart attacks
[35:52.000 --> 35:53.000]  and massive increases in blood clots,
[35:54.000 --> 35:55.000]  it just isn't even a news item.
[35:56.000 --> 35:57.000]  Or the fact that they are criminally
[35:58.000 --> 35:59.000]  adding a very dangerous heart attack
[36:00.000 --> 36:01.000]  drug to the shots.
[36:02.000 --> 36:03.000]  And you're not even supposed to put
[36:04.000 --> 36:05.000]  it into muscle.
[36:06.000 --> 36:07.000]  It's just insane.
[36:08.000 --> 36:09.000]  And then notice a year ago,
[36:10.000 --> 36:11.000]  they said, oh, you got to keep the
[36:11.000 --> 36:13.000]  Pfizer shot and the Moderna shot
[36:14.000 --> 36:16.000]  cool for this mRNA to not get broken
[36:17.000 --> 36:18.000]  down by heat.
[36:19.000 --> 36:20.000]  But notice they don't say you got to
[36:20.000 --> 36:21.000]  keep it cool now.
[36:22.000 --> 36:23.000]  Because they're now adding a chemical
[36:24.000 --> 36:25.000]  to it that's extremely poisonous
[36:26.000 --> 36:27.000]  that lets it stay in stasis.
[36:28.000 --> 36:29.000]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen,
[36:30.000 --> 36:31.000]  this is just insane.
[36:32.000 --> 36:33.000]  I mean, this is not a 5, 10 year
[36:34.000 --> 36:35.000]  approval of some drug.
[36:36.000 --> 36:37.000]  This is them just sticking in
[36:38.000 --> 36:39.000]  whatever they want, whenever they
[36:39.000 --> 36:40.000]  want to get a shot.
[36:41.000 --> 36:42.000]  And you've got these boards that
[36:43.000 --> 36:44.000]  have decided that they've got the
[36:45.000 --> 36:46.000]  criminal cover of the media and
[36:47.000 --> 36:48.000]  the Justice Department to do this
[36:49.000 --> 36:50.000]  to everybody.
[36:51.000 --> 36:52.000]  And of course, I know why that's
[36:53.000 --> 36:54.000]  all happening, Klaus Schwab.
[36:55.000 --> 36:56.000]  They know this is going to discredit
[36:57.000 --> 36:58.000]  the US government.
[36:59.000 --> 37:00.000]  It's going to destroy the FBI.
[37:01.000 --> 37:02.000]  It's going to destroy the FDA.
[37:03.000 --> 37:04.000]  It's going to destroy the CDC.
[37:05.000 --> 37:06.000]  It's going to destroy the Justice
[37:06.000 --> 37:08.000]  Department to protect you.
[37:09.000 --> 37:10.000]  And if we don't stop it,
[37:11.000 --> 37:12.000]  the payback is over.
[37:13.000 --> 37:14.000]  The contract is broken.
[37:15.000 --> 37:16.000]  And the media will then blame
[37:17.000 --> 37:18.000]  America, and we're done.
[37:19.000 --> 37:20.000]  Instead of blaming Klaus Schwab
[37:21.000 --> 37:22.000]  in the UN and their operatives
[37:23.000 --> 37:24.000]  inside the government,
[37:24.000 --> 37:26.000]  Klaus Schwab,
[37:27.000 --> 37:28.000]  Bill Gates,
[37:29.000 --> 37:30.000]  Ted Turner, David Rockefeller
[37:31.000 --> 37:32.000]  before him,
[37:33.000 --> 37:34.000]  Soros,
[37:34.000 --> 37:41.760]  And I don't ask you I order you if you care about yourself and your family to go look up this for yourself and read it
[37:41.760 --> 37:46.820]  Okay, and then I want you to read the side effects and the recommendations and the
[37:48.280 --> 37:51.540]  Counter recommendations it says never inject it into muscle
[37:54.240 --> 37:56.240]  They say injected into the muscle
[37:56.240 --> 38:04.880]  They say the amount is supposed to be given and the amount in the shot is way more than a child even having a heart attack with
[38:04.880 --> 38:12.440]  Dave, I mean this is so evil that it it it's mind blowing and then it gets worse
[38:13.720 --> 38:21.480]  Notice now again, they say they can keep the shot in warmer temperature and they don't tell you why well we we know why now
[38:21.480 --> 38:27.000]  We got a double piece of information for you right now. I remember in October
[38:27.800 --> 38:31.320]  The FDA and CDC knew that all this was gonna happen and it did
[38:32.120 --> 38:34.520]  Just like if I loaded a gun and put it to your head and pull the trigger
[38:34.520 --> 38:38.120]  I know it's gonna shoot a bullet your brain probably kill you certainly you're gonna be hurt bad
[38:39.160 --> 38:42.560]  Well, they knew and they loaded the gun they stuck at our head and they pulled the damn trigger and
[38:43.160 --> 38:47.280]  They even make jokes. They're so crazy like well. We got us give it to the kids and see what it does to him
[38:47.280 --> 38:50.560]  So here it is it is
[38:52.600 --> 38:54.600]  Throw methamene
[38:55.200 --> 38:57.200]  t-r-o-m-e-t-h-a-m-i-n-e
[38:58.680 --> 39:03.160]  If you're driving down the road listening and here it is ladies and gentlemen
[39:03.600 --> 39:10.800]  Here is the FDA announcement October 26. It didn't get published a few days after so about 12 days ago
[39:10.920 --> 39:13.840]  This is when they said we're going to inject the children
[39:13.840 --> 39:20.600]  a few days before Halloween, they finally made the announcement on October 30th FDA briefing document
[39:21.360 --> 39:24.560]  EU a amendment request Pfizer buy in a tech
[39:25.000 --> 39:28.440]  COVID-19 vaccine for use in children five through eleven years of age and
[39:30.080 --> 39:35.240]  Let me turn to the page for you. You got to read the whole document. This is on page 14
[39:37.840 --> 39:40.920]  By the way, you try to put this out on Twitter or Facebook they take it down
[39:40.920 --> 39:43.880]  Disinformation is reading directly from the document
[39:44.480 --> 39:50.560]  To provide a vaccine with an improved stability profile. They should have this for stability the Pfizer
[39:51.640 --> 39:58.320]  Bio in the tech COVID-19 vaccine for use in children five eleven years of age uses the drug right there
[39:58.920 --> 40:01.280]  The same drug we just told you about
[40:02.960 --> 40:06.160]  Throw methamene right there throw methamene
[40:06.160 --> 40:10.320]  Buffer instead of the phosphate buffered saline
[40:11.800 --> 40:15.600]  Once you see cyanide as used in the previous formulation
[40:16.680 --> 40:24.640]  And excludes sodium chloride and potassium chloride the packaging vial for the new formulation are stored frozen
[40:25.280 --> 40:27.280]  and then it goes on
[40:27.280 --> 40:28.880]  so I
[40:28.880 --> 40:35.120]  Just read to you that you can go on my website info wars calm and link through you'll be on the F4
[40:35.120 --> 40:42.360]  You'll be on the FDA.gov and you will read that they don't put the regular saline solution that's in all the vaccines for 100 years
[40:42.560 --> 40:44.560]  They put a toxic
[40:45.080 --> 40:47.080]  very dangerous
[40:47.360 --> 40:52.240]  heart attack drug in it for children at a large dose and
[40:52.960 --> 40:59.920]  It says do not inject it into muscle. It will necrosis the tissue. That means kill it
[40:59.920 --> 41:03.520]  Oh my god, I
[41:05.280 --> 41:06.600]  Mean
[41:06.600 --> 41:11.040]  We let me tab it on our 28 years. Nothing's came even half as close to this
[41:12.520 --> 41:19.200]  The closest thing was learning three years ago that over a million children 30,000 per major city
[41:19.840 --> 41:27.920]  Plus were delivered to child rapist taken from Christian homes ages two to seven and given to rapist through a CIA program
[41:27.920 --> 41:36.160]  Running the German West German government later East Germany to quote create the new system of love a man and a boy or girl having sex
[41:36.160 --> 41:38.520]  This is official run by the German government
[41:39.720 --> 41:43.360]  Told you about it years ago this year it was in New Yorker magazine. I
[41:44.520 --> 41:47.960]  Mean, I mean, I thought that was the you know, like that was the I mean
[41:48.840 --> 41:51.160]  That's horrible. Okay, but a lot of those children lived
[41:51.160 --> 41:58.320]  And that was just one article in DW and one city 30,000 children given by this CPS and then the judges. Oh
[41:59.360 --> 42:04.520]  Yeah, I mean when you wonder why these one of these family court judges are so absolutely deranged out of control
[42:05.960 --> 42:07.960]  That files
[42:07.960 --> 42:09.960]  Had a false large percentage
[42:11.320 --> 42:15.760]  So there you go. Hi. Yeah, that's exactly how they operate
[42:15.760 --> 42:25.240]  I might want to investigate that a little further. I think we will be but the point here is is that when you wonder why they're against your free speech or you
[42:25.240 --> 42:27.920]  Wonder why they're fraternity. They're gonna cult a screwing children
[42:28.440 --> 42:31.680]  So and they don't want to just screw them with their disease penises
[42:32.160 --> 42:36.520]  No, they want to do it ladies and gentlemen with a deadly needle
[42:36.880 --> 42:40.920]  filled with heart attack medication and a system that makes them have blood clots
[42:40.920 --> 42:45.120]  And I was thinking maybe they want to stop them having a heart attack. No, no, no
[42:45.120 --> 42:48.320]  It says in here. It'll make you have a heart attack if it's not done, right?
[42:48.440 --> 42:51.840]  They're actually trying to make children have heart attacks. They are murdering
[42:52.320 --> 42:55.880]  Criminals and I'll probably get assassinated for telling you about it
[42:58.200 --> 43:00.200]  I'm cutting this
[43:03.200 --> 43:04.800]  It's now becoming
[43:04.800 --> 43:13.920]  Accepted knowledge accepted fact that global government run by private corporations is taking over the United States and other formerly sovereign nations

[47:53.560 --> 47:59.680]  But I don't need to be a rocket scientist to be able to extrapolate this out for everybody
[48:00.480 --> 48:06.280]  They're going after the children worldwide with poison shots adding whatever the hell they want
[48:06.760 --> 48:08.760]  With it with no news coverage
[48:09.960 --> 48:16.800]  Against even FDA approval of what you can use these drugs for and not even telling people there's nothing on the inserts of the packages
[48:17.760 --> 48:21.280]  And they cover their ass they think by just posting it
[48:21.280 --> 48:26.280]  I mean, this is a level of criminality that is mind-blowing and then I see all of the news
[48:26.680 --> 48:28.680]  Fox News CNN MSNBC
[48:29.440 --> 48:35.880]  People protesting the mandate are gonna blow stuff up why Aaron Rodgers is the worst man on earth

[48:52.800 --> 48:59.480]  It gives you chronic illness and lowers your immunity not where oh, it's 35% effective or it's 10% effective
[48:59.480 --> 49:04.400]  No, no, they're now reporting and confirming. Oh six months after the Pfizer shots. You have a negative immunity
[49:05.160 --> 49:07.160]  Negative to what you had previous to it. Oh
[49:07.720 --> 49:14.760]  And you get sicker from the shot, but if you want to leave your house in Canada or Europe or Australia
[49:14.760 --> 49:17.880]  I mean if you still try to go outside your house in Germany
[49:17.880 --> 49:22.160]  They beat you over the head with clubs and police dogs. Oh
[49:23.360 --> 49:25.760]  And they have the highest covid levels and and look at this
[49:26.760 --> 49:28.440]  This is out of
[49:28.440 --> 49:30.440]  Scientific American
[49:33.440 --> 49:40.160]  19 months after we did reports on it from MIT videos from PBS and Rice University videos
[49:40.160 --> 49:47.680]  Saying thank you Bill and Melinda Gates for funding these digital tattoos that put microglass into the skin
[49:48.080 --> 49:52.720]  To let us know you've been vaccinated while it delivers the vaccine at the same time now
[49:55.080 --> 49:59.520]  They announced it this year remember they had all the fat checkers say Jones is wrong. It's not true
[49:59.520 --> 50:02.320]  It's fake Bill Gates went on TV and said nobody wants to put
[50:03.600 --> 50:08.240]  Little tracker chips in you know, no, no, and he said that was wife and here it is
[50:08.240 --> 50:13.240]  Invisible ink could reveal whether kids have been vaccinated and oh look at the picture they show
[50:14.000 --> 50:19.840]  It's a new definition. It's not invisible ink. It shows the strip with spikes on it
[50:21.480 --> 50:24.080]  Now they're only a tenth of a millimeter long
[50:24.080 --> 50:29.200]  But they work they're their nanotech into your body and have the quote vaccine and
[50:29.200 --> 50:37.720]  Little tracker numbers that can be read by a reader. Oh member what Peter Dasek and Fauci in 2017 came to the Pentagon and wanted to do
[50:38.360 --> 50:46.680]  They said we want to spray nanotech with with with with this coronavirus hybrid in it that was covered 19 on the batch
[50:47.760 --> 50:54.520]  So we had MIT we had all the documents and they just came out and said member fat checkers Bill Gates isn't putting
[50:54.520 --> 51:00.960]  Chips in the vaccine. No, no, he's just building it proposing it and yesterday the UN came out and said we want to give people
[51:01.600 --> 51:06.680]  Systems with patches that deliver it and nasal systems that put nanotech into your body
[51:07.560 --> 51:13.920]  Remember the day both group two weeks ago said oh, we're gonna start spraying the food supplies with nanotech for your safety
[51:13.920 --> 51:16.280]  Oh, of course, and then a few days later
[51:18.240 --> 51:20.240]  The USDA
[51:20.240 --> 51:27.040]  The USDA oh the crew just found that put that back up that the USDA came out and said oh
[51:27.560 --> 51:33.640]  A week after just as soon as Klaus Schwab says something they that's when they yep, we're now approving outside of lodges
[51:33.640 --> 51:40.520]  We're just doing it. We have that discretion with our board to start spraying your food with nanotech that we can then read inside your body
[51:42.320 --> 51:45.520]  And that's 10 times crazier than 5 G come and you cancer which they admit
[51:45.520 --> 51:50.480]  I mean now it's just we're gonna we're gonna track you with radioactive isotopes that will go to your brain and your tissues
[51:50.480 --> 51:56.120]  So you can never escape us and we can look at the history of what you've been eating and what you've been doing and your carbon footprint
[51:56.120 --> 51:58.120]  Like we're all lab rats. Yeah, there it is
[51:58.960 --> 52:04.680]  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation came to us and they said hey, we have a real problem knowing who's vaccinated
[52:04.680 --> 52:06.680]  So our idea was to put
[52:07.320 --> 52:12.880]  The record on the person oh on them you mean in them and then it's an image of spikes going into your body here
[52:12.880 --> 52:17.960]  It is out of Scientific American the spikes. We showed you over a year and a half ago
[52:19.520 --> 52:21.520]  But oh
[52:21.960 --> 52:27.160]  News guard came out and said we were lying of course even set at the bottom of the news guard article paid for by Microsoft
[52:28.800 --> 52:30.800]  Who's guards run by Microsoft?
[52:32.320 --> 52:34.320]  So now
[52:34.320 --> 52:36.320]  throw methamene
[52:36.800 --> 52:38.800]  Is being put in these children
[52:38.800 --> 52:42.560]  And did they put it in there because they think it'll stop them having a heart attack from the shot
[52:44.120 --> 52:49.920]  Did they even look and go oh this will cause new crows and death in the tissue it's ejected and you can't inject it into muscle
[52:49.920 --> 52:54.720]  It's got to be put into a vein. Oh, it's very toxic. Oh, that's all. No, there's not even a discussion about that
[52:54.720 --> 52:56.720]  There's just oh a little footnote
[52:58.160 --> 53:00.400]  Of the minutes of the FDA here it is
[53:02.640 --> 53:05.920]  And I love how national media calls me Washington Post New York Times
[53:05.920 --> 53:09.520]  You know just and they that they call me and sometimes I don't know who it is and I answer they go
[53:09.520 --> 53:14.880]  They start giggling and saying oh you better defend yourself. Well, you're really getting torn up. Why don't you talk to us?
[53:14.880 --> 53:18.560]  And I tell them I say yeah, uh, do you have any children?
[53:18.560 --> 53:20.320]  You know, they're coming to kill them, right?
[53:20.320 --> 53:27.600]  You think I give a damn about you suing me or attacking me or any of this when you people have signed on to the globalist murdering everyone you psycho crazy people
[53:31.280 --> 53:33.280]  Oh
[53:33.280 --> 53:37.280]  I go crazy people
[53:37.280 --> 53:42.640]  They think they're getting to me lying about me everywhere and and and and sending white supremacists trying to get it
[53:42.640 --> 53:44.640]  I mean you people are nuts
[53:44.640 --> 53:46.640]  You people are demonic. You're crazy
[53:47.760 --> 53:49.760]  You're crazy
[53:49.760 --> 53:55.920]  And you look at me a normal person that does research and cares and doesn't want toxic waste and poison forced on us by a bunch of
[53:55.920 --> 54:00.000]  Eugenesis that say they want to depopulate us cloth swap bill gates all of them
[54:00.000 --> 54:03.520]  And now they're running our medical system and of course it's killing us
[54:04.160 --> 54:08.160]  And you've got Stockholm syndrome though. You can't admit it's happening or you're part of it
[54:10.480 --> 54:15.360]  What they are is arrested development low IQ children they're playing along and pretending
[54:17.440 --> 54:21.120]  That they're even alive they're living in a facsimile program and created to them
[54:21.840 --> 54:24.080]  in a lifetime of watching tv and being on the internet
[54:26.800 --> 54:28.800]  It's called fantasy land
[54:28.800 --> 54:30.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's where these people live
[54:32.000 --> 54:34.240]  And then there's this whole other area that you know
[54:37.040 --> 54:40.320]  This other whole area is so incredible and so insane that
[54:43.360 --> 54:45.360]  I'm gonna cover it in the third hour
[54:45.920 --> 54:47.440]  because
[54:47.440 --> 54:49.440]  I got a bunch of other documents and I want to
[54:50.000 --> 54:52.800]  Read over them and everything and you'd be studies and highlighted for you
[54:53.920 --> 54:56.720]  But they are putting an extremely toxic chemical
[54:56.720 --> 54:59.520]  In the Pfizer shots now
[55:00.640 --> 55:02.640]  Not the heart attack drug that too
[55:02.720 --> 55:06.000]  Um that stabilizes it in a higher temperature that they say
[55:06.960 --> 55:08.960]  Will kill mammals
[55:09.840 --> 55:13.280]  Says that do not use in any mammal tissue. It will kill mammals
[55:14.400 --> 55:16.400]  Do not give two mammals
[55:16.560 --> 55:18.560]  Give two mammals
[55:19.920 --> 55:25.680]  It's like you know the story the rat poison says do not consume not for human consumption poison
[55:25.680 --> 55:27.680]  sculling crossbones
[55:27.840 --> 55:30.400]  And it's just being done to us. So there you go
[55:31.040 --> 55:35.280]  By the way, ladies and gentlemen, you've only got four days left to get store-wide free shipping double factory points
[55:35.520 --> 55:40.800]  And when it's crazy as the world is it could be your last chance anytime to get books films info wash t-shirts
[55:40.800 --> 55:47.360]  So that's gonna be I think pretty collectible in the future during the long years of martial law and combat robots and all the extermination
[55:47.360 --> 55:49.760]  We're gonna have to go through but we'll come out on the end of it
[55:50.080 --> 55:52.720]  I probably won't but that's okay as long as we plant the seeds of resistance
[55:52.720 --> 55:57.840]  But I really would get your storable food now and I really would get 60 off on ultra
[55:59.360 --> 56:03.200]  12 and I would get to the bone broth that's back in stock and the rainforest plus
[56:03.440 --> 56:06.480]  We're just trying to build our war chest up as much as we can to go into the future
[56:06.720 --> 56:08.720]  and we're dug in as much as we can but
[56:09.040 --> 56:13.440]  You know really we're just worried about the children at this point and it's really sad the extermination operation going on
[56:13.440 --> 56:18.080]  But uh, if I would you I would get all your orders in and get your Christmas shopping done right now
[56:18.080 --> 56:20.080]  It's if any of that even really matters
[56:20.080 --> 56:25.280]  Seriously though infowarstore.com or triple eight two five three three one three nine
[56:25.840 --> 56:32.080]  You see they intend to use our normalcy bias against this where we just want to keep doing our bureaucracy and keep having fun
[56:32.640 --> 56:35.840]  You know keep having little parties and doing the little rituals and the rest of it
[56:36.640 --> 56:38.080]  Like Christmas and Thanksgiving
[56:38.080 --> 56:44.640]  But then in the backdrop of that the borders are collapsing and the dollars being devalued and and inflation's exploding and the globalists are
[56:44.880 --> 56:48.400]  Coming us with poison shots and the hospitals are full of people sick from the vaccines
[56:48.400 --> 56:50.400]  got stacks of news admitting that and
[56:51.280 --> 56:55.680]  We had to break out of that normalcy bias and realize how much trouble we're in so yes
[56:56.560 --> 57:00.400]  Things are going to continue grinding on as it's going to get more and more macabre more and more dystopic
[57:00.640 --> 57:02.640]  And people are just going to rationalize more and more
[57:02.720 --> 57:10.320]  We have to shock them out of their normalcy bias to wake up literally spiritually and mentally and electromagnetically and understand what's happening
[57:11.040 --> 57:14.960]  And then transcend these people by not complying with anything they say and exposing them

[58:49.920 --> 58:52.880]  the CEO of visor just came out and said that
[58:53.600 --> 59:00.560]  People talking bad about the vaccines are working for quote dark forces that the fbi and cia have been
[59:00.560 --> 59:04.720]  Advising him on who these evil groups are
[59:05.680 --> 59:09.840]  They know that all over the world their poison shot is being banned by major governments
[59:10.400 --> 59:12.400]  And madernas in trouble as well
[59:12.880 --> 59:16.960]  They know that the people are starting to get wise this depopulation agenda
[59:17.680 --> 59:21.680]  In fact evidence is starting to mount that the shots were supposed to be soft kill weapons
[59:21.920 --> 59:28.720]  But they're so deadly. They're killing a higher percentage up front and so people are waking up
[59:28.720 --> 59:32.080]  The weapons work a little too good
[59:32.640 --> 59:37.600]  They're supposed to be silent weapons for quiet wars, but instead they're making too big of a noise
[59:38.080 --> 59:40.080]  But it's too late for a return back now
[59:40.240 --> 59:42.000]  They're coming after our children
[59:42.000 --> 59:49.440]  So it's up to us to protect our little children or god will not look favorably on us. Remember god is watching
[59:49.440 --> 59:56.880]  If you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[1:00:10.640 --> 1:00:14.720]  Big brother mainstream media government cover-ups
[1:00:15.440 --> 1:00:18.320]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he
[1:00:18.320 --> 1:00:23.520]  Live from the info wars.com studios. It's alex jones
[1:00:26.080 --> 1:00:28.080]  The extraordinary success of this mission
[1:00:28.800 --> 1:00:30.800]  was due to the incredible skill
[1:00:31.280 --> 1:00:32.320]  bravely
[1:00:32.320 --> 1:00:38.960]  And selfless courage of the united states military and our diplomats and intelligence professionals your secretary
[1:00:39.520 --> 1:00:41.520]  President biden has described
[1:00:42.240 --> 1:00:44.240]  the evacuation from afghanistan
[1:00:44.240 --> 1:00:49.360]  As an extraordinary success his words extraordinary success
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:56.800]  This has to be the lie of the 21st century secretary called. Did I hear you say that al qaeda and isis k
[1:00:58.240 --> 1:01:01.920]  Are developing their capability to attack the us within two years
[1:01:02.400 --> 1:01:07.200]  I said was that the current intelligence community's assessment is that isis k could
[1:01:07.200 --> 1:01:13.760]  Potentially develop a capability within six to twelve months and that al qaeda could potentially develop that capability within
[1:01:14.240 --> 1:01:15.520]  One to two years
[1:01:15.520 --> 1:01:19.200]  We have considerable evidence that they have the intent the question at the moment is the capability
[1:01:19.520 --> 1:01:25.760]  Over the past halloween weekend a red alert quietly went off in northern virginia
[1:01:26.080 --> 1:01:34.800]  Informing the public of the possibility of a terrorist attack from an activated isis cell that had been sitting dormant in the united states
[1:01:34.800 --> 1:01:38.400]  Chief kevin davis told us today that this is a serious threat now
[1:01:38.560 --> 1:01:45.360]  What it is exactly remains a mystery because he couldn't get into the specifics and the information he was able to relay
[1:01:45.680 --> 1:01:47.680]  Was very vague
[1:01:55.520 --> 1:01:57.920]  Greater presence in places where people gather
[1:01:58.560 --> 1:02:00.960]  Whether it's a holiday weekend or just a normal weekend
[1:02:00.960 --> 1:02:08.160]  Uh, it's information that we're now aware of and because we're aware of this information and again, it's information that's regional
[1:02:08.880 --> 1:02:10.880]  We're taking the appropriate responsible
[1:02:11.840 --> 1:02:15.040]  actions to ensure that the community knows that that
[1:02:15.600 --> 1:02:24.400]  We we take all information about their safety very seriously as biden's open border handlers ramp up a war against american citizens
[1:02:24.560 --> 1:02:27.360]  Deeming them domestic terrorists for thought crimes
[1:02:27.360 --> 1:02:34.880]  I'm pleased to announce that the administration is today releasing the first national strategy for countering domestic terrorism
[1:02:35.120 --> 1:02:40.640]  Uh, let me ask you about organizations. The oath keepers are a white supremacist organization true
[1:02:41.280 --> 1:02:44.240]  I'm not sure that I can characterize their ideology
[1:02:44.320 --> 1:02:47.760]  I would say that we have charged a number of individuals
[1:02:48.320 --> 1:02:53.280]  Related to specific terrorist activity or violent activity. Maybe it's a better way of putting it
[1:02:53.280 --> 1:03:00.160]  Who self identify with the oath keepers and I think some of those individuals are ones that we would put in this
[1:03:00.800 --> 1:03:02.800]  racially motivated violent extremist category
[1:03:03.760 --> 1:03:09.760]  We also have a number of such investigations of individuals who self identify with the proud boys
[1:03:10.560 --> 1:03:15.840]  Uh, in a similar vein the biggest threat to americans is not jihadist overseas
[1:03:15.840 --> 1:03:23.600]  It's homegrown domestic terrorists inspired by white supremacists the gravest terrorist threat to the homeland is domestic violent extremism
[1:03:23.680 --> 1:03:30.720]  Domestic terrorism is our number one threat. Domestic terrorism has been steadily increasing and that that threat needs to be addressed
[1:03:30.880 --> 1:03:36.800]  Mexican drug cartels are controlling more american territory as the border becomes non-existent
[1:03:37.680 --> 1:03:41.840]  It is a war make no mistake about it and it is happening on american soil
[1:03:41.840 --> 1:03:49.440]  Texas agriculture commissioner Todd Staples says the same gangs that are blamed for thousands of deaths in mexico are now threatening
[1:03:49.600 --> 1:03:54.080]  Our nation's food supply farmers and ranchers are being run off their own property by
[1:03:54.800 --> 1:03:56.240]  armed
[1:03:56.240 --> 1:04:05.280]  Terrorists showing up and telling them to have to leave the land. We witnessed automatic gunfire going from mexico directly into the united states
[1:04:05.760 --> 1:04:10.640]  Um, the national guard soldiers we were with you can hear them kind of reacting saying whoa, holy bleep
[1:04:10.640 --> 1:04:12.640]  Um, they say this is
[1:04:13.040 --> 1:04:20.640]  Suspected cartel gunfire going indiscriminately directly into the united states the national guard soldiers told us multiple times in recent days
[1:04:21.040 --> 1:04:28.320]  Armed cartel members with ak47s have stood on the opposite side of the Rio Grande from them and have taunted them have racked the slides on their guns
[1:04:28.640 --> 1:04:32.240]  And have yelled to them in spanish that oh, we should just shoot you soldiers
[1:04:32.560 --> 1:04:39.520]  So tensions here along the Rio Grande along the border obviously going up and that cartel activity in the city behind us
[1:04:39.520 --> 1:04:40.800]  um
[1:04:40.800 --> 1:04:46.160]  It's still there the road to chaos has been paved with the democrats marxist subterfuge
[1:04:46.320 --> 1:04:54.560]  Either we respond with the lightning rod of justice and reclaim our dying republic or slowly boil past the point of no return
[1:04:55.040 --> 1:04:57.040]  john bown reporting

[1:07:47.520 --> 1:07:52.000]  But this is unrelated to what happened in kenosha because i was not employed by real america's voice at the time
[1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:55.120]  That's something that's happened since then. Yes
[1:07:56.480 --> 1:07:59.920]  And does real america's voice have any sort of
[1:08:01.840 --> 1:08:03.840]  political
[1:08:03.840 --> 1:08:05.840]  Bias or agenda or anything like that
[1:08:07.600 --> 1:08:09.600]  It goes to the bias of the witness your honor
[1:08:13.360 --> 1:08:18.400]  It's fricking video the bias he shot the video the child molesters and others trying to kill him
[1:08:18.400 --> 1:08:24.320]  This is not a pack of scum out burning down the town and um, I don't know how you would isolate
[1:08:26.320 --> 1:08:29.440]  A person's particular politics
[1:08:31.120 --> 1:08:33.280]  And determine that that person is going to
[1:08:34.800 --> 1:08:38.160]  Evaluate the evidence one way or another okay, how about
[1:08:39.760 --> 1:08:47.040]  Your videos that you have captured of these incidents that you call riots they're very
[1:08:47.040 --> 1:08:49.040]  Uh slanted against
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:55.680]  The people who are right you call riots mostly peaceful black lives matter rioters
[1:08:55.920 --> 1:08:58.880]  3 billion in damage rioting in the footage. Yes, absolutely
[1:08:59.520 --> 1:09:03.360]  And so you came here to kenosha because you felt that's what was going on here
[1:09:03.840 --> 1:09:07.680]  Um, I felt like it could have possibly been a riot on the first night
[1:09:08.160 --> 1:09:11.120]  So when I showed up it turned out to be a very violent riot
[1:09:11.120 --> 1:09:16.800]  And you continued to cover that on sunday monday and tuesday night. I covered it sunday night
[1:09:17.440 --> 1:09:21.840]  I went back to how evil he is and then came back covering the precious rioters
[1:09:21.840 --> 1:09:23.840]  So you weren't here on monday night at all no
[1:09:26.800 --> 1:09:34.080]  And on tuesday night you were recording video with your body cam. Yeah, you were also recording it with your cell phone. Yes
[1:09:34.080 --> 1:09:41.120]  The last video that we just watched there of the shooting of joseph rose and balm
[1:09:41.840 --> 1:09:45.040]  Was that recorded on your body cam or on your cell phone both?
[1:09:47.520 --> 1:09:49.520]  I just saw one video
[1:09:49.520 --> 1:09:53.520]  Did I were there's more than one video that you just shared with us? Uh, there's two
[1:09:53.840 --> 1:09:59.120]  There's the body cam and then there's the cell phone as well. What was the one we just saw?
[1:09:59.680 --> 1:10:01.680]  I believe that may have been both
[1:10:01.680 --> 1:10:03.680]  I
[1:10:04.080 --> 1:10:07.120]  Where is the body cam located when you were on your body right here?
[1:10:07.680 --> 1:10:14.240]  And when you recorded the shooting of joseph rose and balm, where were you holding your cell phone right here?
[1:10:15.440 --> 1:10:17.680]  Okay, so the cell phone is
[1:10:18.720 --> 1:10:20.400]  You're using your right hand
[1:10:20.400 --> 1:10:24.800]  Above your shoulder. Is that yes? Uh, shoulder
[1:10:27.200 --> 1:10:28.640]  Uh
[1:10:28.640 --> 1:10:33.680]  Same as my shoulder right here and the body cam you said was over on the left side of your chest
[1:10:34.080 --> 1:10:38.320]  Is that right? I believe so. Yes the video that we just saw I had a single angle
[1:10:38.400 --> 1:10:40.720]  I didn't have two separate angles. So when you tell us
[1:10:41.360 --> 1:10:43.600]  That's both. I don't understand what you mean
[1:10:44.240 --> 1:10:47.280]  Uh, that means that there's two recordings of the same thing
[1:10:47.520 --> 1:10:52.080]  And that's why I submitted to the defense and the prosecution the entire videos
[1:10:52.240 --> 1:10:56.320]  There's maybe about 80 to 100 trying to confuse the jury that drew edited it
[1:10:56.320 --> 1:11:00.320]  Deceptively what I'm asking you is what we just watched
[1:11:00.880 --> 1:11:04.320]  Which camera were you using to record that both?
[1:11:05.600 --> 1:11:07.600]  Is that edit is that video edited?
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:14.240]  Uh, no, I have not edited it, but it has been put together at the right time the timing. Who did that?
[1:11:14.880 --> 1:11:16.720]  I did that
[1:11:16.720 --> 1:11:23.600]  So you combine two video sources into one. Yeah, that's what you do when you put on a news report with the same timing and audio
[1:11:23.600 --> 1:11:29.840]  But at the same time it could all be seen the jury could see for themselves if they look at the body cam footage
[1:11:29.840 --> 1:11:31.840]  It's the exact same thing
[1:11:32.480 --> 1:11:34.480]  That's what I'm trying to get
[1:11:36.480 --> 1:11:43.360]  What a punk what you said if the jury looks at the body cam footage is that separate from the cell phone footage?
[1:11:43.600 --> 1:11:45.760]  Yeah, there's obviously two devices recording
[1:11:46.960 --> 1:11:51.440]  And you're telling us that the video that we just watched can we have exhibit 151?
[1:11:51.440 --> 1:11:53.440]  Play it again, please
[1:12:01.040 --> 1:12:03.040]  This is blown up in their face so bad
[1:12:03.360 --> 1:12:08.480]  They're literally supporting a pedophile a thief and a wife beater running around attacking people
[1:12:09.920 --> 1:12:12.160]  And now they're demonizing a journalist has a lot of courage
[1:12:16.480 --> 1:12:18.480]  Okay
[1:12:18.480 --> 1:12:20.480]  Uh
[1:12:21.040 --> 1:12:27.280]  Mr. Hernandez, we have the video that was the the last one played for you exhibit 151 up on the screen
[1:12:27.600 --> 1:12:29.600]  Can we play that forward please?
[1:12:32.400 --> 1:12:36.640]  Now as we're watching this video, mr. Hernandez, you're telling us that what we're seeing
[1:12:37.040 --> 1:12:40.720]  Has been recorded by two separate devices at the same time
[1:12:41.440 --> 1:12:43.440]  This is a body cam
[1:12:43.760 --> 1:12:47.920]  And then you put audio from the other camera on this video where it switches to your cell phone
[1:12:47.920 --> 1:12:50.400]  That's what we do. Can you please point that out to us?
[1:12:50.480 --> 1:12:54.160]  Oh, you'd have to fast forward all the way to when I get to car source three
[1:12:57.760 --> 1:12:59.760]  Can we skip
[1:13:01.840 --> 1:13:06.080]  You know skip to the two and a half minute mark, I guess I don't know this is so incredible
[1:13:07.440 --> 1:13:14.000]  This idiot is trying to imply that he's deceptively edited it when there's hundreds of camera shots of all this crap happening a little further back
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:18.400]  Okay, can we go back maybe 30 seconds? I don't know a little further back
[1:13:18.960 --> 1:13:24.240]  Right a little star right here. Okay. I'll tell you when it switches. Okay. Well, can it pause its life
[1:13:25.040 --> 1:13:26.560]  What drew did is when it's dark
[1:13:26.560 --> 1:13:30.800]  He uses the body cam because that got better footage and when he gets in the light he cuts to the cell phone
[1:13:31.120 --> 1:13:33.680]  All you do is take them with a timecode and sync them up on a computer
[1:13:33.840 --> 1:13:38.480]  You can flip back and forth in the edit and most people know that but they're trying to act like he did something deceptive
[1:13:38.480 --> 1:13:44.480]  Because there's two different videos. Yeah put together
[1:13:48.720 --> 1:13:50.720]  Literally no end of this guy
[1:13:54.800 --> 1:13:58.480]  That's what they got a big problem on the left stop burning down everything and running around
[1:13:59.680 --> 1:14:01.680]  Doing this stuff
[1:14:01.920 --> 1:14:03.920]  That we got the footage of these little monsters
[1:14:03.920 --> 1:14:05.600]  right
[1:14:05.600 --> 1:14:08.480]  There
[1:14:08.480 --> 1:14:12.400]  Okay, by the way, I now have third world populations running around in my backyard
[1:14:12.960 --> 1:14:14.960]  In austin in west austin
[1:14:14.960 --> 1:14:21.120]  What you again today you took i'm gonna start videotaping it of your body cam video and a portion of your cell phone video
[1:14:21.440 --> 1:14:23.440]  And you splice them together
[1:14:23.680 --> 1:14:29.760]  Um, I don't know if I would say splice but I put them together. That's an old-fashioned movie term from when they used to have
[1:14:30.240 --> 1:14:31.520]  actual
[1:14:31.520 --> 1:14:33.760]  film
[1:14:33.760 --> 1:14:35.760]  Why did you do that?
[1:14:35.840 --> 1:14:40.720]  Because it's just saying exactly that like I said you could take a look at the body cam footage as well. It's the
[1:14:41.840 --> 1:14:47.520]  You can see it as well on there and you've you're testifying here today that through your attorney
[1:14:48.240 --> 1:14:51.760]  You have provided the defense and the state with
[1:14:52.960 --> 1:14:57.760]  That entire incident recorded on both your body cam and on your cell phone. Yep
[1:14:57.760 --> 1:15:04.320]  But what we just saw was your editing of them together. You guys asked for my footage. So I gave it to you
[1:15:04.880 --> 1:15:06.880]  Through your attorney. Yes
[1:15:06.880 --> 1:15:09.600]  That's an attorney that you uh have out of madison
[1:15:11.120 --> 1:15:15.280]  Some relevance to this well your honor. We've had a lot of questions about other people
[1:15:18.240 --> 1:15:20.400]  All right, let's go to break it pause there. I know it's live
[1:15:20.480 --> 1:15:24.880]  We can pause it now. I'm gonna come back with more of this by the way and all the democrat run sandy hook suits
[1:15:24.880 --> 1:15:28.640]  They sue it's all about what prescriptions are you on?
[1:15:29.360 --> 1:15:33.200]  How do your satellites work? Who are your affiliates? Who are your sponsors? How do we shut you down?
[1:15:33.600 --> 1:15:35.600]  Nothing to do with the sandy hook people
[1:15:36.320 --> 1:15:40.080]  So, I mean watching watching a real judge versus these people is
[1:15:40.800 --> 1:15:42.800]  Unbelievable, but I mean we know that
[1:15:42.960 --> 1:15:46.640]  And my love that judge is a democrat. He's just an old school. And that's not a complete monster

[1:20:01.200 --> 1:20:03.840]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[1:20:14.960 --> 1:20:17.520]  Countries across the world are announcing lockdowns
[1:20:19.120 --> 1:20:21.120]  For the unvaccinated
[1:20:21.120 --> 1:20:25.440]  As more governments ban the Pfizer and Moderna shots for causing heart attacks
[1:20:26.320 --> 1:20:27.120]  That's coming up
[1:20:27.120 --> 1:20:30.240]  but we are focusing some on the written house trial because
[1:20:30.720 --> 1:20:34.160]  A reporter we've interviewed many times and actually worked with some on the border drew Hernandez
[1:20:35.280 --> 1:20:39.360]  Is there in Kenosha on the stand and we're watching the rat like
[1:20:40.720 --> 1:20:42.720]  Soros lawyer
[1:20:43.840 --> 1:20:46.880]  Go after him and it's it's it's it's blowing up in his face
[1:20:46.880 --> 1:20:50.880]  He's trying to imply that because he's got a body cam. It's black and white. He's got a cell phone
[1:20:50.880 --> 1:20:54.880]  That's color when he gets into the areas that are more lighted. He's got the footage synced up
[1:20:54.880 --> 1:20:58.480]  They show that when it's darker. They show the black and white and he's trying to imply that
[1:20:59.200 --> 1:21:05.600]  Oh a lawyer you hired a lawyer to fake all this when they have the raw footage from both the cell phone and the
[1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:09.280]  Tam they know they have it in evidence bait stamp as it's called
[1:21:09.760 --> 1:21:14.640]  They're just playing games. They also asked for his edited video that he put out on the internet
[1:21:14.640 --> 1:21:18.400]  Uh, which is again, it's not edited for deception but edited to put the best footage
[1:21:18.960 --> 1:21:21.520]  Together of what happened in a linear way. Here it is
[1:21:23.120 --> 1:21:28.080]  Help the need to retain an attorney to provide video on this case. I think it goes to bias
[1:21:28.880 --> 1:21:30.880]  I think it goes to credibility
[1:21:31.520 --> 1:21:36.560]  It's been asked by the witness. Let's take the lunch break. Um, please don't talk about the case during the break
[1:21:36.560 --> 1:21:43.200]  Um, let's get running behind
[1:21:45.840 --> 1:21:48.160]  Yeah, again, they said they're going to a lunch break but
[1:21:49.360 --> 1:21:54.240]  We'd pause this before I went to break and they're still going as of when I was outside just a moment ago
[1:21:54.240 --> 1:21:56.240]  So let's go back to it
[1:21:57.840 --> 1:22:00.080]  All right, so we've got a bit of a mystery going here
[1:22:01.280 --> 1:22:05.360]  All right now they decided to go to break and I guess the news is just looping something from earlier
[1:22:05.360 --> 1:22:09.680]  Well, as that unfolds, we will go over all of it for you. All right
[1:22:10.880 --> 1:22:12.880]  I'm gonna be honest with you
[1:22:16.640 --> 1:22:22.160]  The news today and this is happening more and more obviously because the globals are taking over and things are getting really bad
[1:22:23.920 --> 1:22:25.920]  But if that was a wartime rug caster
[1:22:26.320 --> 1:22:29.520]  Saying world war two or vietnam and there was big battles going on
[1:22:30.480 --> 1:22:31.760]  I would
[1:22:31.760 --> 1:22:35.520]  Just come in for maybe five ten minutes at a space and talk about what was happening
[1:22:38.320 --> 1:22:41.520]  But that's not the way this is. I mean I could talk for a hundred hours
[1:22:42.640 --> 1:22:44.640]  and never get to all this and
[1:22:46.400 --> 1:22:50.880]  I'm just completely exhausted by it and I have a responsibility to cover all this
[1:22:51.760 --> 1:22:53.760]  but at the same time
[1:22:54.320 --> 1:22:57.280]  Maybe I just want to tune in and watch football or something. I mean, maybe
[1:22:57.920 --> 1:23:00.800]  Maybe the globalist are right and maybe it's just too much what they're doing
[1:23:00.800 --> 1:23:04.480]  I should just hide my head in the sand and let them just go ahead and kill all the kids
[1:23:05.600 --> 1:23:09.840]  And just take all the shots they say and just you know slowly die because they're superior to me
[1:23:10.400 --> 1:23:12.880]  They're the globalists. They they deserve to inherit the earth
[1:23:14.240 --> 1:23:16.240]  But I can't do that ladies and gentlemen
[1:23:17.520 --> 1:23:19.520]  I can't do that so
[1:23:20.800 --> 1:23:22.800]  I'm not gonna do that
[1:23:22.800 --> 1:23:30.480]  I'm gonna cover the news and the only way I can do this is to just start over
[1:23:31.600 --> 1:23:36.320]  And just start plowing right through this stuff, but it's it's just unbelievable. I mean they're on the news announcing
[1:23:37.040 --> 1:23:40.320]  We're gonna put implantable microchips in you to make sure you're vaccinated
[1:23:42.080 --> 1:23:45.680]  And then they have separate articles saying it doesn't exist them, but we need to take the microchip
[1:23:45.760 --> 1:23:48.720]  There is no microchip, but you need to take it and we're gonna do it to you
[1:23:49.680 --> 1:23:50.960]  I mean
[1:23:50.960 --> 1:23:53.360]  It's just it's so crazy
[1:23:54.240 --> 1:23:57.200]  To see this type of warfare using propaganda and
[1:23:57.920 --> 1:24:03.440]  confusion and demoralization and the the outright poisoning of the population
[1:24:05.360 --> 1:24:08.720]  And because the population's never faced a type of covert war like this
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:15.760]  The population doesn't know what hit them. I mean the clips of the australian chancellor the leader of their
[1:24:18.480 --> 1:24:20.480]  Parliament
[1:24:20.480 --> 1:24:23.040]  Creepily, I mean I can cover the whole show just on this
[1:24:23.840 --> 1:24:26.640]  Your life's over, you know, we're gonna put you in a camp
[1:24:27.200 --> 1:24:30.640]  If we catch you outside your house when you're not vaccinated, we're gonna put you in a camp
[1:24:31.360 --> 1:24:35.520]  We're gonna make your life miserable and then and then they've got other australian
[1:24:36.080 --> 1:24:38.080]  Premiers governors saying it they've got
[1:24:38.880 --> 1:24:40.400]  the new zealand
[1:24:40.400 --> 1:24:42.880]  Prime minister saying it and and that's just so
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:46.000]  Damn evil
[1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:51.280]  I mean this isn't like growing up as a kid and you watch some cartoon where there's lex luther and the legion of doom
[1:24:51.280 --> 1:24:54.000]  And they're doing bad stuff and they cackling giggle
[1:24:54.560 --> 1:25:00.560]  There's footage of the main health minister cackling like a witch and saying your life's basically over and we're gonna give you
[1:25:00.960 --> 1:25:05.040]  A shot every two months and snickering and giggling with big ugly yellow teeth
[1:25:05.040 --> 1:25:13.360]  And and I've just gotten to the point of yeah, okay, the trial's still going here, I guess. I don't know what's going on
[1:25:16.160 --> 1:25:18.160]  P-e-y-t-o-m
[1:25:18.720 --> 1:25:21.200]  Engel e-n-g-e-l as an expert witness
[1:25:21.280 --> 1:25:26.320]  He's employed by the same firm that also is representing this witness
[1:25:26.880 --> 1:25:31.040]  So I think that that goes to buy us an expert from a law firm. Is that what you're telling me?
[1:25:31.600 --> 1:25:33.440]  I'm stating that right
[1:25:33.440 --> 1:25:36.320]  The expert was did um a phone dump
[1:25:37.600 --> 1:25:44.960]  So they have an expert who does what you would describe is when the when uh law enforcement takes a cell phone and does uh
[1:25:46.160 --> 1:25:48.160]  A search of the phone sure, okay
[1:25:48.480 --> 1:25:49.840]  that's
[1:25:49.840 --> 1:25:53.680]  What he did they they employ someone there to do it for
[1:25:54.560 --> 1:25:55.680]  anyone
[1:25:55.680 --> 1:25:57.680]  And we used that person
[1:25:58.240 --> 1:26:01.040]  Um to do it for mr. Rittenhouse
[1:26:01.040 --> 1:26:03.040]  They didn't know legal work
[1:26:03.600 --> 1:26:10.480]  And is that term it for a lawyer client kind of thing. He did it to do um, I think it's a cell bright
[1:26:11.440 --> 1:26:13.280]  No instruction
[1:26:13.280 --> 1:26:15.280]  If you asked me to do a phone dump
[1:26:18.080 --> 1:26:25.440]  In addition to thinking uh, um, I would uh, I would have to go to somebody to comply
[1:26:25.440 --> 1:26:31.840]  Uh, by the way, this is what's going on in the sandy hook stuff that they asked for computer stuff
[1:26:32.160 --> 1:26:37.920]  There's nothing to do with sandy hook for expert witness services. And then they go. Well, this isn't the zr
[1:26:38.560 --> 1:26:40.160]  79 q-wave
[1:26:40.160 --> 1:26:47.120]  Transferring a file. So we say it's not real. I mean, it's like just game after game after game
[1:26:48.080 --> 1:26:50.080]  It's the same crap the Soros guy's doing
[1:26:50.080 --> 1:26:56.160]  To do with this witness, but it's again, it's not something where he's hiring an attorney to help him buy a piece of property
[1:26:56.400 --> 1:26:58.640]  Or get him out of a divorce or something like that
[1:26:58.880 --> 1:27:03.920]  It's directly pertaining to this is all meant to confuse the jury, you know, they're out of the room right now
[1:27:03.920 --> 1:27:05.920]  He was doing it earlier when they were in there
[1:27:07.200 --> 1:27:09.680]  That this is somehow fake the lawyers
[1:27:10.640 --> 1:27:13.520]  Made him go to the data dump expert guy
[1:27:13.520 --> 1:27:17.920]  They've got hired to forensically do it to document it was his phone and his footage
[1:27:17.920 --> 1:27:24.480]  Which is ridiculous level to go to this is a big high-profile case. So now because it was done by a forensics person
[1:27:25.600 --> 1:27:29.120]  They're acting like that's bad. I mean, this is just next level ladies and gentlemen
[1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:32.000]  this is the next level
[1:27:32.560 --> 1:27:34.560]  and
[1:27:36.960 --> 1:27:38.960]  It just it just blows my mind
[1:27:39.760 --> 1:27:45.280]  That we sit here as a society and put up with this but look I'll go back to more of the written house if anything important comes up
[1:27:45.280 --> 1:27:50.960]  But he's totally innocent. He's vindicated. It's blown up in their face, but don't underestimate the power of political correctness
[1:27:51.920 --> 1:27:53.920]  They got one leftist juror on that
[1:27:54.640 --> 1:27:56.640]  panel they will
[1:27:56.800 --> 1:27:58.240]  attack
[1:27:58.240 --> 1:28:00.240]  and be little
[1:28:00.720 --> 1:28:04.240]  And pressured that jury till they vote to send written house to prison
[1:28:06.080 --> 1:28:12.080]  And they want it bad, but I I think he's going to be found not guilty because it's just so overwhelming if leftist on the jury
[1:28:12.080 --> 1:28:15.520]  You know they're on there try to bully the other jurors. I think it'll blow up in their face
[1:28:17.120 --> 1:28:20.160]  So I say he's found not guilty, but I could be wrong
[1:28:21.280 --> 1:28:22.640]  because
[1:28:22.640 --> 1:28:24.800]  I have seen the power of the leftist brainwashing
[1:28:24.800 --> 1:28:25.680]  I mean
[1:28:25.680 --> 1:28:30.080]  You see the entire media defending a convicted child rapist who raped a bunch of little boys
[1:28:30.480 --> 1:28:34.080]  Running around saying i'm going to kill you to somebody and try to take his gun away and attacking him
[1:28:34.400 --> 1:28:37.600]  And they're defending him like he is the second coming of christ
[1:28:37.600 --> 1:28:44.320]  Which is perfect. I mean that's that's he'll probably make the guy of a patron saint or something because
[1:28:44.720 --> 1:28:46.720]  Their religion is hurting children
[1:28:47.040 --> 1:28:50.960]  All right, we're going to go to break and i'm going to come back and just rampage through the news

[1:33:36.560 --> 1:33:42.960]  Hitler took the guns stalin took the guns mal took the guns that el castro took the guns you go saw this took the guns

[1:33:56.960 --> 1:34:08.880]  Upon the altar of god internal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man
[1:34:10.560 --> 1:34:15.840]  The answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:34:15.840 --> 1:34:30.400]  All right, we are broadcasting worldwide on this november 11 th thursday transmission 11 11
[1:34:33.680 --> 1:34:37.920]  Okay, i'm just going to start where i began last hour and a lot of people just joined us and this is such huge
[1:34:37.920 --> 1:34:40.160]  News it should be on every news channel in the world
[1:34:40.720 --> 1:34:44.240]  It should be shouted from the rooftops. It should be at every pta meeting
[1:34:44.240 --> 1:34:49.440]  It should be parents angry at all these vaccination centers should be there warning people
[1:34:50.400 --> 1:34:52.400]  I mean imagine if you knew
[1:34:53.680 --> 1:34:58.400]  That milk at a school lunch program in say albuquerque new mexico
[1:34:59.680 --> 1:35:05.120]  That a couple hundred cartons of that milk had gotten contaminated with say e-coli
[1:35:05.600 --> 1:35:07.600]  And that it might hurt or kill children
[1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:10.320]  And you were the person that discovered that for whatever reason
[1:35:11.040 --> 1:35:13.040]  You would call the school
[1:35:13.040 --> 1:35:16.560]  And then if you didn't see anything take action you'd call the police
[1:35:17.200 --> 1:35:21.600]  Hell you'd probably you know if you live close by getting a car and drive there to warn people right because that's
[1:35:22.080 --> 1:35:26.400]  That's a normal thing to do that's something that you know you want other people to act like that
[1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:33.760]  But here is the fda run by a bunch of revolving door individuals paid off by big pharma on record
[1:35:34.400 --> 1:35:40.400]  And the head of reuters, you know on the board of it as well running their scam and phisor is the big globalist arm doing all this
[1:35:40.400 --> 1:35:42.400]  With their mr. And a vaccine
[1:35:43.440 --> 1:35:47.440]  And they want to be able to just to put in you what they want when they want how they want
[1:35:49.440 --> 1:35:55.520]  Whenever they want and so they actually came out with shots that we knew two years ago almost two years ago
[1:35:55.680 --> 1:36:00.880]  We're going to cause serious problems and we predicted what would happen then in october documents came out where the fda and cdc
[1:36:00.880 --> 1:36:07.920]  Said exactly what the experts on my show had said blood clots of microchorditis heart attacks autoimmune problems ade
[1:36:07.920 --> 1:36:09.920]  And a body
[1:36:10.800 --> 1:36:12.800]  dependency enhancement
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:20.000]  And now we see all that happening. Well, they knew more than we did they they launched the whole plan they created the virus
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:22.000]  They created the fear they did it
[1:36:22.640 --> 1:36:25.280]  And it just so happens every damn one of them from peter dazik to
[1:36:26.240 --> 1:36:29.840]  Fauci to bill gates run their mouth about wanting to get rid of the population
[1:36:29.840 --> 1:36:35.600]  I mean when you watch the movie 12 monkeys in like five minutes you figure out this guy really is going to release a bio weapon
[1:36:35.600 --> 1:36:39.200]  He's a crazy environmentalist wants to get rid of humans. I mean they're telling you
[1:36:40.080 --> 1:36:46.080]  But but you actually see it in the real world and people are like, whoa, I'm not going to believe that that's too frightening
[1:36:47.440 --> 1:36:52.240]  Same thing with trump once trump got tricked into this thing and he can get the economy going by a vaccine
[1:36:52.240 --> 1:36:56.720]  He thought it was a regular vaccine and he thought it was a regular vaccine and he thought it was a real vaccine
[1:36:56.720 --> 1:37:00.800]  Once he took it and thinks he's fine probably did wasn't even given it
[1:37:00.800 --> 1:37:06.640]  He doesn't want to admit that he got tricked. So he's committed. I said this over a year and a half ago
[1:37:06.640 --> 1:37:08.640]  I said trump
[1:37:08.640 --> 1:37:12.960]  And the lawyers and the teachers and the bureaucrats and the parents that have gone along with this
[1:37:13.680 --> 1:37:20.640]  When it comes out that it causes all these problems, they're going to defend it and keep doubling down because they don't want to admit
[1:37:20.640 --> 1:37:22.640]  They're wrong. It's too scary
[1:37:22.640 --> 1:37:25.520]  They don't want to admit. They're wrong. It's too scary
[1:37:26.720 --> 1:37:31.920]  That's the difference between conscious informed powerful individuals and slaves
[1:37:32.400 --> 1:37:36.560]  Is that slaves? I don't care if they're billionaires or living them by the side of the river
[1:37:36.960 --> 1:37:41.520]  What i'm saying is is that they're spiritually poor. They don't know how to admit when they're wrong
[1:37:42.960 --> 1:37:45.120]  They just second to second believe
[1:37:47.120 --> 1:37:50.080]  That they're fine everything's okay because of selfishness
[1:37:50.800 --> 1:37:52.080]  in eight
[1:37:52.080 --> 1:37:54.240]  intense ignorance and selfishness
[1:37:55.440 --> 1:37:57.920]  And of course, nobody is as alone as a selfish person
[1:37:59.040 --> 1:38:04.160]  Nobody is as alone as these people are and so this was all done by behavioral psychologists
[1:38:04.160 --> 1:38:08.160]  They work in but all that's admitted and they are seducing the world
[1:38:08.800 --> 1:38:10.800]  and the decadent west
[1:38:11.200 --> 1:38:16.160]  To not even want to admit they got conned but to get into wearing the mask and living in fear and
[1:38:16.560 --> 1:38:19.440]  you know being heroes in 15 days to
[1:38:19.440 --> 1:38:22.080]  Stop the spread and
[1:38:23.520 --> 1:38:25.520]  flatten the curve
[1:38:26.160 --> 1:38:31.040]  And we're coming up on two years of this crap in a couple months and they're now like well, it's permanent
[1:38:32.240 --> 1:38:37.200]  Well, if you don't take whatever the shots are you can't leave your house and if we catch you you're going to prison
[1:38:38.960 --> 1:38:40.720]  Imagine if I told you five years ago
[1:38:40.720 --> 1:38:44.880]  They're gonna release a virus and use as a pretext for a global idea and a global lockdown
[1:38:44.880 --> 1:38:49.680]  And use successive viral releases to keep tightening things down until we had absolutely no freedoms
[1:38:49.840 --> 1:38:52.880]  Well, you'd say I was alex jones wouldn't you alex jones did say that
[1:38:54.800 --> 1:39:00.800]  Because alex jones reads the documents like operation lockstep and alex jones cites the documents
[1:39:02.400 --> 1:39:04.400]  And I cited for you
[1:39:04.400 --> 1:39:14.160]  From the FDA's own website their own information from october 26 that no one even picked up on until yesterday
[1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:18.880]  That they're putting a dangerous heart attack drug
[1:39:19.840 --> 1:39:21.680]  in the shot
[1:39:21.680 --> 1:39:26.960]  That it says do not inject into muscle it can kill somebody and they're injecting into muscle and you're like well
[1:39:26.960 --> 1:39:31.040]  They they're gonna get caught. That's crazy. They don't care. They're doing it on purpose
[1:39:31.040 --> 1:39:35.600]  To set the and then all the people injecting this are involved in a crime, too
[1:39:37.440 --> 1:39:40.560]  You know, there was a great movie on HBO. I got to meet the producer
[1:39:40.720 --> 1:39:44.880]  He's a listener one time he came to visit me, but he's the most most produced guy on HBO
[1:39:45.520 --> 1:39:48.720]  I'm not gonna say his name, but he was the producer of the series room
[1:39:49.120 --> 1:39:54.400]  It's a very accurate series from the period and actually what happened and like julius caesar has hired this one centurion
[1:39:55.040 --> 1:39:58.480]  To go around and make all the payoffs for him because he's a famous hero and very respected
[1:39:58.480 --> 1:40:01.200]  And people see the hero at their house to pay them off
[1:40:01.920 --> 1:40:04.720]  They just go ahead and take the payoff and then he goes good
[1:40:05.440 --> 1:40:09.360]  You've gotten them to sell out for almost nothing and now that they're corrupted
[1:40:09.520 --> 1:40:13.280]  I wouldn't have to pay them off in the future because I can just expose the factor corrupted
[1:40:14.080 --> 1:40:16.080]  You see how that works
[1:40:17.360 --> 1:40:20.880]  You know when the globalist planted child porn on us they they approached and they're like
[1:40:20.880 --> 1:40:28.240]  Hey, we can talk to you now and alex can you know, we're not going to release the fact that there's child porn on his email
[1:40:29.360 --> 1:40:33.360]  Going on air the next day said you're not framing me. We never opened that email
[1:40:33.360 --> 1:40:37.440]  That's not child porn and we got the epiata issue a letter saying we were the victims of that
[1:40:37.440 --> 1:40:42.080]  But they just thought I'd be like all the other people that were corrupted at the boy scouts and the vatican
[1:40:42.320 --> 1:40:47.920]  Everywhere else where they weren't involved in the pedophilia, but they well don't say anything about this or it'll hurt you too
[1:40:47.920 --> 1:40:51.200]  Just cover this up with us and you know spurn it out
[1:40:52.320 --> 1:40:53.680]  so
[1:40:53.680 --> 1:40:57.200]  This is how they operate and it's how they work and this is a giant
[1:40:59.120 --> 1:41:01.920]  seduction going on right now
[1:41:04.480 --> 1:41:06.480]  This is a giant
[1:41:07.360 --> 1:41:10.080]  seduction and corruption taking place
[1:41:10.880 --> 1:41:14.560]  And do you think the soccer moms when their child gets a chronic heart problem?
[1:41:14.560 --> 1:41:20.080]  You think when they she buries that child and average in three years to ten years three to ten years. They die after having microditis
[1:41:21.600 --> 1:41:23.600]  56%
[1:41:23.600 --> 1:41:24.800]  56% die
[1:41:24.800 --> 1:41:29.360]  Within three to ten years. You think those moms are gonna admit they killed their child. No
[1:41:29.600 --> 1:41:35.840]  They're gonna inject any other children. These mothers don't care if they kill all three of them. I'm talking about mothers that are under the spell
[1:41:36.880 --> 1:41:39.280]  And that mother will fight hell
[1:41:39.280 --> 1:41:44.640]  She'll probably become a nurse and she'll come with the police one day and she'll hold your child down while you're putting the back of
[1:41:44.640 --> 1:41:46.640]  A patty wagon to inject them
[1:41:49.120 --> 1:41:54.240]  They love it. They love dying. They love death. They love fraud. They love evil
[1:41:58.320 --> 1:42:00.320]  And so that's how this works ladies and gentlemen
[1:42:01.360 --> 1:42:03.360]  And that's the process
[1:42:03.520 --> 1:42:05.120]  So then I ask all of you
[1:42:05.120 --> 1:42:09.760]  Why would anybody sell out to these people so you can drive around in a fancy car and
[1:42:10.480 --> 1:42:15.280]  Stuff for a few more years and lose your your soul. I mean, even if you don't believe in god
[1:42:15.440 --> 1:42:22.240]  Do you really want to be involved killing children? I mean, do you really want to be involved with all this stuff with the CEO of fizer
[1:42:22.480 --> 1:42:24.480]  Who the big powerful man?
[1:42:25.040 --> 1:42:27.840]  Oh, the big big tech says they're gonna live forever
[1:42:28.240 --> 1:42:31.520]  Ray Kurzweil no ray Kurzweil you're gonna be dead in the ground just like your father
[1:42:31.520 --> 1:42:37.680]  You're never gonna resurrect your father. You're never gonna resurrect yourself. You're a joke. You're a con man. You're a fraud
[1:42:39.040 --> 1:42:41.520]  But you've been in a paper scanner
[1:42:42.160 --> 1:42:46.000]  And so now you tell us that you're gonna become a god and step on us
[1:42:46.800 --> 1:42:51.040]  No, god's gonna flush you down the galactic toilet and all of you globalist
[1:42:51.440 --> 1:42:55.360]  You're all loser jokes. So keep playing god. You're gonna burn
[1:42:57.600 --> 1:43:00.800]  I'm cutting I never compromise the quality of ingredients
[1:43:00.800 --> 1:43:04.000]  We put an infill war's life products and that's why for more than two years
[1:43:04.000 --> 1:43:08.240]  We've been sold out of ultimate bone broth and we could never get the ingredients again

[1:43:58.160 --> 1:44:01.280]  If a hurricane is smashing into the gulf coast
[1:44:02.080 --> 1:44:04.080]  And I make the prediction
[1:44:04.560 --> 1:44:09.440]  That it's going to cause flooding. That's not a prediction. You know, it's a hurricane. You know, it's got a lot of water
[1:44:09.440 --> 1:44:11.120]  It's going to die up. It's going to cause flooding
[1:44:11.120 --> 1:44:13.120]  So it wasn't a prediction 20 months ago
[1:44:13.680 --> 1:44:16.800]  When I said the un order to lock down the world economy
[1:44:17.040 --> 1:44:20.560]  It's going to cause a chain reaction that's going to cause supply chain problems for years
[1:44:20.560 --> 1:44:27.440]  And it's going to starve tens of millions to death and now it all happened 25 million extra dead hundreds of millions on the verge of starvation
[1:44:27.680 --> 1:44:30.000]  And the un that ordered it's running around being the savior
[1:44:30.720 --> 1:44:35.360]  Listen when the first world collapses the third world dies and now the first world's becoming the third world

[1:45:58.560 --> 1:46:01.440]  the CEO of visor just came out and said that
[1:46:02.240 --> 1:46:09.200]  People talking bad about the vaccines are working for quote dark forces that the fbi and cia have been
[1:46:09.200 --> 1:46:13.280]  Advising him on who these evil groups are
[1:46:14.240 --> 1:46:18.400]  They know that all over the world their poison shot is being banned by major governments
[1:46:19.040 --> 1:46:21.040]  And madernas in trouble as well
[1:46:21.440 --> 1:46:25.520]  They know that the people are starting to get wise this depopulation agenda
[1:46:26.320 --> 1:46:31.360]  In fact evidence is starting to mount that the shots were supposed to be soft kill weapons, but they're so
[1:46:32.000 --> 1:46:37.280]  Deadly they're killing a higher percentage up front and so people are waking up
[1:46:37.280 --> 1:46:40.720]  The weapons work a little too good
[1:46:41.280 --> 1:46:46.240]  They're supposed to be silent weapons for quiet wars, but instead they're making too big of a noise
[1:46:46.800 --> 1:46:48.800]  But it's too late for them to turn back now
[1:46:48.960 --> 1:46:50.640]  They're coming after our children
[1:46:50.640 --> 1:46:58.080]  So it's up to us to protect our little children or god will not look favorably on us. Remember god is watching
[1:46:58.080 --> 1:47:04.480]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[1:47:04.480 --> 1:47:06.480]  You
[1:47:25.680 --> 1:47:28.000]  It is literally life and death
[1:47:28.000 --> 1:47:34.320]  For us to expose the fact that the Pfizer shot has a heart attack drug in it
[1:47:34.960 --> 1:47:36.960]  In fact today, I'm gonna make a flyer
[1:47:37.280 --> 1:47:42.160]  We did this 10 years ago with the h1n1 vaccine that was causing a lot of illnesses nothing compared to this
[1:47:42.720 --> 1:47:44.720]  and we created flyers on the site
[1:47:45.520 --> 1:47:48.320]  And told listeners that they should if they wanted to
[1:47:49.040 --> 1:47:51.040]  Go print those off and post them in legal
[1:47:51.840 --> 1:47:53.840]  and lawful areas and
[1:47:55.360 --> 1:47:57.360]  The thing that would happen would be
[1:47:57.360 --> 1:48:01.360]  The media would get pissed that people dare engage in the first amendment
[1:48:02.480 --> 1:48:06.560]  And it ended up getting on close to 100 local radio stations in just one
[1:48:07.200 --> 1:48:09.200]  campaign we did
[1:48:09.280 --> 1:48:11.280]  and so now
[1:48:12.080 --> 1:48:18.160]  Imagine if you print it off just regular printer paper size with an image and a statement on it
[1:48:19.840 --> 1:48:21.840]  With the fact at the bottom that the Pfizer
[1:48:22.720 --> 1:48:25.280]  Injection for children contains a dangerous
[1:48:25.280 --> 1:48:27.280]  heart attack drug
[1:48:28.720 --> 1:48:31.600]  And that this is all done in emergency authorization
[1:48:35.120 --> 1:48:42.080]  Some people are going to get warned and care and they're going to warn others others are going to get pissed and call the media and the media will
[1:48:43.040 --> 1:48:45.040]  self-righteously come
[1:48:45.440 --> 1:48:47.440]  And and say this is so evil
[1:48:47.440 --> 1:48:52.560]  We need to arrest who's done this and then i'll get letters threatening like it from san francisco in places
[1:48:52.560 --> 1:48:58.800]  That if you put these up again, we're going to have you arrested for terrorizing the public or we're going to have you arrested for people
[1:48:59.200 --> 1:49:02.160]  Littering because some of the papers fell on the ground
[1:49:02.400 --> 1:49:07.440]  Meanwhile, they're promoting people that are pedophiles and rapists and shooting people and killing people
[1:49:07.440 --> 1:49:11.680]  I mean, you know, san francisco jurors let illegal aliens go that willfully shoot
[1:49:12.080 --> 1:49:16.240]  White women in the back because they're white and then they deserve to die because they're white remember that
[1:49:17.840 --> 1:49:22.160]  It's just so crazy. So oh mostly peaceful burning things down
[1:49:22.160 --> 1:49:24.160]  Fiery but mostly peaceful
[1:49:25.600 --> 1:49:28.320]  So yeah, that's the bare minimum of civil disobedience is
[1:49:29.680 --> 1:49:32.880]  Let's just do this send them to show tips at info wars.com
[1:49:34.320 --> 1:49:38.880]  Everybody get on your own photoshop create your own flyer. It could be color. It could not be color whatever
[1:49:39.520 --> 1:49:43.600]  and any ones I look at this afternoon that are accurate based on the facts about
[1:49:45.360 --> 1:49:47.360]  Throw methamene in these articles
[1:49:47.360 --> 1:49:53.840]  I'm going to post on the front page of the site tomorrow and have a call to action for everybody to go post them
[1:49:54.800 --> 1:49:59.040]  in areas of your towns and your cities and it ends up happening around the world
[1:49:59.520 --> 1:50:01.280]  Even in new zealand and australia hell
[1:50:01.280 --> 1:50:05.200]  We need a whole section on the site with flyers for new zealand flyers for
[1:50:05.760 --> 1:50:09.440]  Because anybody could do this but info wars is one of the few places that still has millions of viewers
[1:50:09.840 --> 1:50:11.600]  That can't be censored as easy
[1:50:11.600 --> 1:50:15.280]  So the old days you could put this on facebook or twitter and some people would see it now
[1:50:15.280 --> 1:50:20.320]  They won't let you defend anybody or warn anybody. They want to hold you down. All this happens. So
[1:50:22.640 --> 1:50:26.000]  I'll have the crew make some simple stuff as well that has the facts on it
[1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:28.160]  But I'd like to see what you send in show tips
[1:50:28.800 --> 1:50:30.800]  at info wars.com
[1:50:31.120 --> 1:50:33.360]  A lot of folks come up with like a cobra with fangs
[1:50:34.080 --> 1:50:36.640]  and it would say warning, you know the the
[1:50:38.800 --> 1:50:42.800]  H1N1 vaccine contains this well this this you can tell them what it contains
[1:50:42.800 --> 1:50:49.280]  Experimental mRNA with a heart attack drug that's been illegally added. I mean we got to really hit them
[1:50:50.960 --> 1:50:54.640]  And we got to stop waiting because I've been thinking what about to do civil disobedience wise
[1:50:57.440 --> 1:50:59.440]  And I have climbed billboards before
[1:51:00.240 --> 1:51:02.240]  And spray painted them when they did
[1:51:02.560 --> 1:51:03.680]  I mean, I
[1:51:03.680 --> 1:51:05.440]  It's fun to go out at 3 a.m. And do that
[1:51:05.440 --> 1:51:07.600]  But I'm not going to tell you to do that because you'd fall off and die
[1:51:07.600 --> 1:51:11.040]  But I mean just do whatever you think's best. Well, you know, it's up to you what you do
[1:51:11.040 --> 1:51:13.040]  But I mean we let them kill these children
[1:51:14.880 --> 1:51:21.040]  We're gonna go to sit-ins at these clinics at Walgreens or wherever the stuff's going on and we got to start doing something
[1:51:22.640 --> 1:51:26.240]  Because I don't feel you know, God feels very approvingly of me right now
[1:51:27.120 --> 1:51:29.120]  Yeah, I'm not doing enough. I need to do more
[1:51:30.160 --> 1:51:33.040]  Yeah, go read the 198 methods of nonviolent action
[1:51:33.040 --> 1:51:40.400]  Very important information and it's it's it's very accurate and it's very powerful. You should use it
[1:51:40.880 --> 1:51:46.880]  Let's say that again for radio listeners the 198 methods of nonviolent protest and persuasion
[1:51:48.240 --> 1:51:50.240]  We better start doing it now
[1:51:50.480 --> 1:51:55.040]  The bare minimum is take the feet of this show take the archives of this show take the articles
[1:51:55.040 --> 1:52:00.800]  I mean look at this look at this stuff. Let me just stop for the rest of the segment. We've got jade ire coming on as a guest
[1:52:00.800 --> 1:52:07.600]  He's really an expert on the occult and the Illuminati and how they're operating what really happened in uh, this occultic ritual
[1:52:08.560 --> 1:52:10.560]  Did exactly what was supposed to do in
[1:52:11.280 --> 1:52:13.280]  Houston last weekend
[1:52:14.080 --> 1:52:15.280]  with
[1:52:15.280 --> 1:52:19.200]  Travis Scott and Drake and the rest of it and so he's gonna be joining us
[1:52:20.240 --> 1:52:23.600]  But let me just do this since I said I would here's the main focus
[1:52:23.600 --> 1:52:30.160]  Promethamine is use to treat and prevent problems in the blood
[1:52:31.920 --> 1:52:36.240]  FDA document show Pfizer secretly added heart attack drug to children's COVID vaccines
[1:52:36.640 --> 1:52:41.440]  There's the link in my article to the FDA document. Here's the FDA document on page 14
[1:52:44.080 --> 1:52:48.560]  And then we've got all the literature about what it actually does and how toxic it is in the body
[1:52:48.560 --> 1:52:51.520]  How it can't be injected into muscle and the side effects
[1:52:51.520 --> 1:52:55.440]  And that's how they are injecting at the children. I mean, this is just crazy
[1:52:57.040 --> 1:52:59.040]  And it goes on from there
[1:52:59.760 --> 1:53:05.040]  The propaganda the old majority of parents are gonna get it. So people go, oh, I better do it. It's all lies
[1:53:06.960 --> 1:53:08.640]  Meanwhile
[1:53:08.640 --> 1:53:11.760]  Pfizer vaccine Pfizer comments on legally
[1:53:12.720 --> 1:53:14.720]  distinct wording
[1:53:14.960 --> 1:53:16.960]  They got common
[1:53:16.960 --> 1:53:23.200]  Common renterry is the drug that's approved in 2026 and the Pfizer vaccine is not approved now
[1:53:23.200 --> 1:53:29.840]  They play those deceptive games even the heavy calm. It's not a right wing publication goes. Wow. That's crazy. You know lies
[1:53:31.680 --> 1:53:36.400]  Oh, the tiny tweak behind COVID-19 vaccines. Oh, they added a heart attack drug and
[1:53:36.960 --> 1:53:42.560]  They added a chemical in it so it can get hot which by the way, they say don't ever inject the human body
[1:53:42.880 --> 1:53:44.880]  I got all that too
[1:53:44.880 --> 1:53:46.240]  Oh
[1:53:46.240 --> 1:53:50.080]  Don't worry the researchers are hatching a low-cost coronavirus vaccine. They're gonna make you take it
[1:53:51.120 --> 1:53:53.600]  We've got all the studies and reports on how dangerous it is
[1:53:54.160 --> 1:53:56.160]  We've got the fact sheets on the chemical
[1:53:57.200 --> 1:53:59.200]  I'm gonna be doing a whole other report on that today
[1:54:00.320 --> 1:54:02.320]  But here it is. It's the tris buffer
[1:54:04.080 --> 1:54:07.920]  At hop ax fc.com you can read all about the buffer they're using
[1:54:10.080 --> 1:54:11.120]  And then they go into it
[1:54:11.120 --> 1:54:17.920]  It says the concerns it has a tendency to permeate membranes. Therefore it is not suitable for most cell culture work
[1:54:18.880 --> 1:54:23.520]  It is a it is toxic for many mammalian cells. We're a mantle folks. You see, you know
[1:54:24.400 --> 1:54:29.040]  It goes on from there. Whatever good for you. Also, Annie freezing the shot, but hey
[1:54:30.960 --> 1:54:35.280]  It's okay that tim cook runs death camps because you know why where's a black turtleneck
[1:54:35.280 --> 1:54:41.040]  Anderson Cooper, you know, he's got the Planned Parenthood lady on saying take all your shots
[1:54:41.600 --> 1:54:45.600]  That didn't kill you when you were little. They're gonna kill you now. It's okay because he's gay, right? Look here they are
[1:54:46.320 --> 1:54:50.880]  They got the doctor on there with a bow tie from baler. Yeah, the heart attacks. You know, it's no big deal
[1:54:50.880 --> 1:54:55.440]  That's 15 times, you know, the normal amount, but that's okay 15 times. No big deal
[1:54:55.440 --> 1:54:58.880]  And this is all up there telling us have a heart attack. It's normal. Come on
[1:54:58.880 --> 1:55:04.720]  And I got to play this, you know jay dyer is coming up g20 brazil balson arrow questions the director general of the
[1:55:04.720 --> 1:55:06.240]  who
[1:55:06.240 --> 1:55:10.160]  About how people are dying despite having the second shot and how more people are sick from the shot
[1:55:10.160 --> 1:55:15.680]  Now the un lockdowns have caused tens of millions of starved to death. Well, what a great leader. That's what trump ought to be doing
[1:55:17.760 --> 1:55:21.760]  There's so much incredible stuff that I've got here, but let me let me hit this right here
[1:55:22.240 --> 1:55:26.880]  Israel holds war games to prepare for more lethal covid strain
[1:55:26.880 --> 1:55:28.880]  For more lethal covid strain
[1:55:29.440 --> 1:55:34.000]  And and and that means oh the next round of shots and how they're going to lock down because it's never going to end
[1:55:34.160 --> 1:55:38.080]  There's always gonna be new covid strains that they've introduced because it just keeps replicating and changing
[1:55:39.440 --> 1:55:43.440]  Yep, Israel is the model for endless martial law. Germany hits record new covid cases
[1:55:43.840 --> 1:55:46.880]  Despite being one of the most vaccinated countries in europe and it gets worse
[1:55:47.520 --> 1:55:52.400]  They now are admitting it's causing heart attacks and children are saying don't give the modernist shot to people under 30
[1:55:52.560 --> 1:55:54.880]  Now germany's joined france and a bunch of other european countries
[1:55:54.880 --> 1:55:56.880]  But you'll never hear that on the news here
[1:55:57.920 --> 1:56:04.880]  a taiwan halt second dose of bio inatec vaccinations for ages 12 to 17 amid concerns of microcarditis

[2:00:07.440 --> 2:00:10.320]  There was something so pleasant about that place
[2:00:10.880 --> 2:00:14.320]  Even your emotions haven't let go in so much space
[2:00:14.640 --> 2:00:18.320]  All right folks jdauer is coming up next segment and I've got a correction to make
[2:00:19.040 --> 2:00:21.520]  I got so many papers flying around so much going on
[2:00:22.800 --> 2:00:26.800]  That I saw articles last night this morning where australian ministers
[2:00:26.800 --> 2:00:30.160]  Are saying we've got lockdowns for the unvaccinated coming
[2:00:30.320 --> 2:00:33.360]  I mean even last week a couple of their premiers of different states
[2:00:33.840 --> 2:00:40.640]  Saying that and we do have a new clip of one of the ministers saying similar things today. So I conflated that I mixed it
[2:00:41.680 --> 2:00:48.000]  With austria saying they're going to knock the people down who aren't vaccinated because it's all you and run
[2:00:48.080 --> 2:00:53.280]  So things are so bad. I'm a mistake. It's actually accurate because it's so widespread. But here it is
[2:00:53.280 --> 2:01:00.400]  Asi health chief says people who don't get vaccinated will be miserable lonely for life
[2:01:03.040 --> 2:01:05.520]  And lockdown and it's the same thing out of austria
[2:01:06.480 --> 2:01:10.320]  They used a government corruption probe to get rid of the populace president
[2:01:10.720 --> 2:01:14.160]  Austrian lockdown for a vaccinated is days away. Chancellor says
[2:01:14.720 --> 2:01:16.720]  Reuters is reporting
[2:01:18.320 --> 2:01:22.640]  So I was reading in australia where they were saying it and I met them said australia is a chancellor
[2:01:22.640 --> 2:01:24.960]  I thought they're a prime minister. I said, oh, that must be the leader of their parliament
[2:01:25.280 --> 2:01:29.440]  But I was wrong, but I was right things are so bad that I was right as well
[2:01:30.160 --> 2:01:32.240]  That's what I mean. It's just global. It's all the same thing
[2:01:32.800 --> 2:01:37.680]  And what you see in spain and austria and germany and the uk and the united states
[2:01:40.880 --> 2:01:45.920]  Now there it is austria lockdown for unvacced israel holds covet war games
[2:01:46.880 --> 2:01:48.640]  record german cases
[2:01:48.640 --> 2:01:54.160]  Despite all the injections and all the garbage and all the crap because it's made up. Oh, there's a real virus
[2:01:54.160 --> 2:01:59.920]  But the test or frauds pcr test now. They've got a soros bill gates own blood tests. They're gonna make you do
[2:02:00.320 --> 2:02:06.240]  I mean, this is marshal law and all these people go shows just go along with it and we'll move on just take your shot
[2:02:06.240 --> 2:02:09.600]  It protects you. Oh, it doesn't protect you. You got to take more shots
[2:02:11.360 --> 2:02:16.960]  Here's the aussie health minister says people who don't get vaccinated will be miserable and lonely for life
[2:02:16.960 --> 2:02:24.000]  The queensland president of the australian medical association said during a television appearance that people still refusing to get the vaccine
[2:02:24.240 --> 2:02:26.480]  Will be miserable lonely for the rest of their lives
[2:02:27.040 --> 2:02:29.040]  Oh, he's gonna hold you hostage
[2:02:29.040 --> 2:02:31.040]  It sticks the needle in its skin
[2:02:31.440 --> 2:02:33.920]  Or it goes back in the hall again. Here it is
[2:02:34.880 --> 2:02:41.520]  Play from the premier. There's no doubt about it. Um, that you have to try and get people to lose something in order to get something
[2:02:41.520 --> 2:02:46.480]  Um, and and look there are going to be dramas. I'm sure especially around the gold coast area
[2:02:46.560 --> 2:02:48.800]  But there's only really one decision for people to make. Yeah
[2:02:50.960 --> 2:02:54.800]  Oh, they're crazy not to get vaccinated life will be miserable without being vaccinated
[2:02:55.120 --> 2:02:56.800]  You won't be able to get any
[2:02:56.800 --> 2:02:59.920]  You won't be able to hide you won't be able to get a doctor to sign off
[2:03:00.480 --> 2:03:04.880]  That you got an exclusion because there's quite set rules on that and doctors will be
[2:03:05.520 --> 2:03:08.880]  audited to see every one of their exclusions will be
[2:03:08.880 --> 2:03:12.480]  Looked at very carefully. They'll get fine. They can get struck off
[2:03:13.440 --> 2:03:15.440]  the patients who tell
[2:03:15.840 --> 2:03:18.720]  Lies can be charged with fraud. There's a whole pile of
[2:03:19.760 --> 2:03:23.600]  Issues whole pile of problems if you try and get around the system
[2:03:24.240 --> 2:03:27.120]  It's going to be very hard to maintain your employment if you're not vaccinated
[2:03:27.600 --> 2:03:30.000]  You won't be able to go anywhere for any entertainment
[2:03:31.040 --> 2:03:37.520]  So by all means get vaccinated you've got another week where you can get double vaccinated before the 15th to 17th of december
[2:03:37.520 --> 2:03:43.040]  When it's definitely coming in and there'll be there'll be proof that you've been vaccinated firm proof
[2:03:43.440 --> 2:03:45.840]  You'll be asked to show going into most venues
[2:03:46.480 --> 2:03:52.000]  So get vaccinated. Otherwise you're going to have a very very lonely life and you're not going to be able to maintain your employment
[2:03:54.160 --> 2:04:00.800]  Well, there you go. So whether it's austria or australia, it's all the same and I got the clip again last week where the actual
[2:04:00.800 --> 2:04:07.200]  Governor I guess they call him premieres and one of the stages like you'll be locked up coming soon this christmas
[2:04:07.760 --> 2:04:09.760]  You won't be allowed out if you don't have it
[2:04:10.480 --> 2:04:12.480]  And if we catch you outside your house, we're going to arrest you
[2:04:13.040 --> 2:04:14.800]  And we'll take your house
[2:04:14.800 --> 2:04:19.360]  So it's on ladies and gentlemen and you see I told you you take the shot. Oh, it didn't work
[2:04:19.360 --> 2:04:20.320]  There's more shots
[2:04:20.320 --> 2:04:26.720]  But it does attack the ovaries and the testicles and it does create cancer and it does turn off your white blood cells that attack cancer
[2:04:26.720 --> 2:04:33.120]  And all these idiots are going to take it. They're going to slowly get sick and die and society is going to collapse
[2:04:33.120 --> 2:04:36.880]  And that's how you get a post industrial world by the year 2030
[2:04:37.440 --> 2:04:40.560]  Back to un said they would do back in 1992 under world treaty
[2:04:40.880 --> 2:04:47.200]  There's a world treaty to do all this a world treaty to cut your energy off and shoot you up with poison and kill you
[2:04:48.000 --> 2:04:52.160]  And I guess people just want to roll over and let them murder you and murder your children
[2:04:52.960 --> 2:04:54.960]  unbelievable
[2:04:54.960 --> 2:04:58.160]  I am cutting this announcement on the afternoon
[2:05:02.240 --> 2:05:04.240]  It's now becoming accepted
[2:05:04.240 --> 2:05:12.640]  Knowledge accepted fact that global government run by private corporations is taking over the united states and other formerly sovereign nations
[2:05:12.960 --> 2:05:16.080]  They're being destroyed all the checks and balances are being annihilated
[2:05:16.480 --> 2:05:23.120]  Our borders are being destroyed our currency is being destroyed and the american people have been listed as terrorist by the rogue federal government
[2:05:23.120 --> 2:05:27.280]  Info wars is going to continue to fight on and there is a big awakening happening
[2:05:27.280 --> 2:05:29.040]  We have a good chance of beating these people
[2:05:29.040 --> 2:05:32.160]  But we're not going to be able to stay on air unless you support us and you've been doing it

[2:06:02.480 --> 2:06:08.160]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation crashing through the lies and disinformation
[2:06:08.720 --> 2:06:10.720]  It's alex jones
[2:06:11.680 --> 2:06:13.120]  I know he is a
[2:06:13.120 --> 2:06:18.560]  Best-selling author a great researcher and is even more up to speed on globalist documents than I am
[2:06:18.560 --> 2:06:24.400]  And he joins us to talk about why why the elite controllers are obsessed with satanism luciferianism
[2:06:24.720 --> 2:06:30.400]  The occult paganism they're bringing back in the world today, and I told you I get to this earlier
[2:06:30.560 --> 2:06:34.640]  We will how woke is him is a new religion the left even admits it is
[2:06:35.200 --> 2:06:40.560]  And claus Schwab says to mara. He's announcing the new world religion called the great narrative
[2:06:41.120 --> 2:06:43.120]  So we're going to be getting to all of this
[2:06:43.120 --> 2:06:48.320]  And extinction rebellion and and and what this system wants and what it's doing
[2:06:49.360 --> 2:06:54.720]  But it's just good old-fashioned moloc worship of 3 000 years ago brought back again
[2:06:54.720 --> 2:07:00.800]  But I thought because it dovetails so well we play a short three minute report that greg reese filed yesterday
[2:07:00.800 --> 2:07:02.800]  That's at mandat video. That's so important
[2:07:02.960 --> 2:07:09.840]  Dealing with the fact that this is the overwrite of the christian ethos with the ethos of absolute barbarism
[2:07:09.840 --> 2:07:12.880]  And the jackabins, you know them as satanist. Here it is
[2:07:20.800 --> 2:07:26.320]  Healthy society is built upon the balance between competition and cooperation
[2:07:26.960 --> 2:07:31.040]  Where cooperation is often simply not harming each other
[2:07:31.920 --> 2:07:35.360]  today's laws based on christian ideology
[2:07:35.360 --> 2:07:39.360]  Compel us to restrain our animal selves
[2:07:40.000 --> 2:07:43.040]  Satanism is the opposition to this balance
[2:07:44.160 --> 2:07:50.160]  It seeks to destroy christian ideology so that the law is written by the ruthless
[2:07:50.960 --> 2:07:54.000]  Because ruthlessness is their only advantage
[2:07:55.120 --> 2:08:00.960]  In a healthy society those who seek to feed off of others are forced into hiding
[2:08:00.960 --> 2:08:08.080]  But today they are hiding no more after decades of it being injected into pop culture media
[2:08:08.720 --> 2:08:14.480]  We are becoming all too familiar with the satanic rituals these miscreants love to celebrate
[2:08:15.840 --> 2:08:23.440]  Whatever actually happened at travis scott's astroworld festival. It was clearly designed as a satanic ritual
[2:08:25.040 --> 2:08:28.480]  There are different names of gods who demand human sacrifice
[2:08:28.480 --> 2:08:31.520]  But mulloch has been the most popular
[2:08:32.160 --> 2:08:35.200]  And we can see the obvious depiction at astroworld
[2:08:35.680 --> 2:08:42.240]  Where people could symbolically volunteer to ritually sacrifice themselves into the mouth of mulloch
[2:08:44.400 --> 2:08:47.360]  But the real symbolism can be seen on stage
[2:08:48.320 --> 2:08:53.920]  The spiraling portal with non-human entities and flames emerging from it
[2:08:53.920 --> 2:08:59.840]  The same ritual we've seen at the gothard-based tunnel opening ceremony in 2016
[2:09:00.560 --> 2:09:04.240]  Where a portal was opened and demonic entities were unleashed
[2:09:05.040 --> 2:09:08.160]  The same ritual made famous by allister crowley
[2:09:08.800 --> 2:09:10.800]  The birth of the antichrist
[2:09:11.040 --> 2:09:13.040]  The amalantra working
[2:09:13.600 --> 2:09:16.560]  The cross being fed into the portal of hell
[2:09:17.600 --> 2:09:22.560]  In other words the death and destruction of humanity as we know it
[2:09:22.560 --> 2:09:23.760]  The coal
[2:09:23.760 --> 2:09:25.120]  Depopulation
[2:09:25.120 --> 2:09:28.960]  Eight people died and dozens were rushed to the hospital
[2:09:29.760 --> 2:09:32.880]  With at least 11 suffering from heart attacks
[2:09:34.000 --> 2:09:36.000]  Victims as young as nine years old
[2:09:37.040 --> 2:09:40.240]  Video show several people having seizures
[2:09:40.800 --> 2:09:42.000]  And collapsing
[2:09:42.800 --> 2:09:46.800]  A security guard claims that someone stuck him with a syringe
[2:09:47.200 --> 2:09:50.080]  And rumors have resulted that people were drugged
[2:09:50.080 --> 2:09:57.680]  But isn't it more likely, given that these are the same reactions we have been seeing from the experimental jabs, that they are one and the same?
[2:09:58.800 --> 2:10:05.120]  Statistically speaking, if you get enough of the vaxed in one place, injuries like this will occur
[2:10:06.240 --> 2:10:09.520]  The entire world has become rife with human sacrifice
[2:10:10.000 --> 2:10:14.640]  And these rituals are likely meant to give themselves the illusion of legitimacy
[2:10:14.640 --> 2:10:19.680]  But they are merely the rotten parasites in an otherwise humane world
[2:10:21.280 --> 2:10:26.400]  The real concern is that their anti-human culture is going mainstream
[2:10:26.400 --> 2:10:44.400]  For infowars.com, this is Greg Ries
[2:10:47.920 --> 2:10:52.080]  Satanic rituals and human sacrifice at the Travis Scott Astroworld Festival
[2:10:52.080 --> 2:10:57.680]  We'll find the report at Band-Aught Video in the Gregory section it needs to be seen by young people
[2:10:58.240 --> 2:11:00.240]  So they know what you're dealing with
[2:11:01.360 --> 2:11:06.080]  All right, joining us is Jay Dyer of jaysanalysis.com, YouTube Jay Dyer
[2:11:06.880 --> 2:11:11.520]  He is a author, comedian, TV presenter known for his deep analysis of Hollywood geopolitics and culture
[2:11:11.680 --> 2:11:14.320]  His graduate work focused on psychological warfare and film
[2:11:14.480 --> 2:11:20.080]  He's an author of two books, Esoteric Hollywood One and Two, and the co-creator co-host told us to show Hollywood decoded
[2:11:20.080 --> 2:11:23.440]  And he joins us now. Jay, great to have you here with us
[2:11:24.000 --> 2:11:29.200]  Let's start getting into what really happened last weekend and where this is going in your view
[2:11:30.800 --> 2:11:36.560]  Yeah, well, I'm glad that you played the Greg Ries clip because the first thing I saw when I started looking into this
[2:11:37.360 --> 2:11:40.240]  was the similarities to the Gotthard Tunnel
[2:11:40.800 --> 2:11:46.080]  Event and for anybody that's skeptical, you know, this is a pattern that we've seen all the way back to
[2:11:46.080 --> 2:11:52.480]  the Super Bowl ceremonies that, you know, the halftime shows that this is a consistent pattern where they will
[2:11:53.120 --> 2:11:55.120]  intentionally interject
[2:11:55.200 --> 2:12:02.080]  Occult esoteric and now openly satanic imagery and if anybody doubts it, I mean, I'm starting to notice a turn
[2:12:02.400 --> 2:12:03.760]  where people are
[2:12:03.760 --> 2:12:08.240]  Maybe previously skeptical but after this event a lot of people are saying hey wait a minute
[2:12:08.240 --> 2:12:13.040]  This looks like maybe there's something too. That's even breaking into the mainstream media. They're admitting that hey
[2:12:13.040 --> 2:12:17.680]  You know newsweek had a thing saying hey, it looks like there's probably actually something going on here
[2:12:17.680 --> 2:12:21.920]  Well, sure. I mean little not having sex with the devil. I mean all of this. It's it's a full-on assault
[2:12:23.760 --> 2:12:29.680]  Yeah, and I want to keep in mind too that as you know, uh, if you go back to the lusis trust the un
[2:12:29.840 --> 2:12:32.800]  You know, they promoted this new religion this new anon
[2:12:33.360 --> 2:12:38.400]  Decades ago. Alice Bailey wrote that book externalization the hierarchy that you referenced quite a bit
[2:12:38.400 --> 2:12:44.560]  And if you look in that book she says that really the goal of all of this is a new world religion
[2:12:44.640 --> 2:12:47.680]  a new religion that will be amenable to earth worship to
[2:12:48.560 --> 2:12:50.560]  You know the green agenda basically so
[2:12:51.120 --> 2:12:54.320]  Really a lot of this and I'm not saying there aren't people that don't take it seriously
[2:12:54.320 --> 2:12:56.960]  Some of them do take it very seriously to satanic elements of it
[2:12:56.960 --> 2:13:01.200]  But there's another layer to which it's just another tool of social engineering and control
[2:13:01.840 --> 2:13:03.840]  To denigrate and to ritually
[2:13:03.840 --> 2:13:09.840]  Uh, they use the word brutalize the public and what that does is it puts us into a catatonic state
[2:13:10.400 --> 2:13:14.160]  It's a form of trauma that they use through mass media to really just
[2:13:14.640 --> 2:13:17.680]  Disdeningrate people and and according to some of the satanists themselves
[2:13:17.760 --> 2:13:23.120]  They see these rituals as ways to put people into a lower frequency a lower vibration
[2:13:23.520 --> 2:13:25.520]  To where they can't think beyond
[2:13:26.080 --> 2:13:28.080]  The the basic pleasure drives the basic
[2:13:29.040 --> 2:13:31.760]  Bringing lower than the third dimension so you can be programmed
[2:13:31.760 --> 2:13:36.400]  Yeah, basically turning them into beasts to be part of the beast system
[2:13:36.720 --> 2:13:41.360]  You beastialize the the population to make them a willing, uh, you know
[2:13:41.920 --> 2:13:43.920]  Willingly complicit in the beast system
[2:13:45.200 --> 2:13:49.600]  And look at this footage of all these so-called elites going to be part of these public satanic ceremonies now
[2:13:49.840 --> 2:13:51.840]  Like they're all powerful. These are losers
[2:13:53.440 --> 2:13:57.120]  Yeah, a lot of these people, uh, you know, even in the artwork itself
[2:13:57.120 --> 2:14:03.120]  That tells them that they will not go into the future. You know Madonna just did a Eurovision thing a year before covid
[2:14:03.520 --> 2:14:07.680]  And at that ceremony she dressed up in a bunch of robes and it was this big ritual
[2:14:08.240 --> 2:14:13.120]  And the song that she did was, uh, none of you will go into the future or something like that
[2:14:13.200 --> 2:14:17.360]  Not everybody's going into the future. You can't go into the future unless you're part of this agenda
[2:14:17.680 --> 2:14:20.640]  It's literally in the lyrics of the song. Uh, it was, uh
[2:14:21.360 --> 2:14:25.120]  Um, not everyone is coming in the future. Not everyone is going to last
[2:14:25.120 --> 2:14:30.320]  Yeah, that's it. Uh, and and basically there's gas masks people wearing gas masks all around here
[2:14:30.320 --> 2:14:35.520]  Which is very odd right a year before this was 2018 or 19 before all this stuff broke out
[2:14:35.600 --> 2:14:41.040]  Well, they even had a fashion show called covid 19 in France. I mean, it's it's all in our face
[2:14:42.480 --> 2:14:47.200]  Yeah, and we know from the the you know spars the cladex the crimson contagion
[2:14:47.520 --> 2:14:49.760]  That this was an organ that had been playing a long time
[2:14:49.760 --> 2:14:56.880]  So I think we really do see a lot of coordination between these, you know controlled megastars and the top down, you know
[2:14:57.200 --> 2:15:01.040]  Clashwap system they they're all promoting the same thing and it goes all the way back 50 years
[2:15:01.440 --> 2:15:04.160]  To alice bailey and the united nations promoting the new
[2:15:04.800 --> 2:15:09.600]  Aquarian the new age, you know decades before the the hippies and you know hate aspirin
[2:15:09.760 --> 2:15:15.120]  She's showing you new york destroyed and everyone nerve-gassed and they're getting ready for that
[2:15:15.120 --> 2:15:23.280]  Yeah, and then I keep in mind too, uh, this is about brutalizing the youth, um, you know, everybody's upset
[2:15:23.280 --> 2:15:28.880]  I'm not trying to denigrate, you know, the people that die. That's terrible. But you know, what travis Scott is really there to do
[2:15:29.040 --> 2:15:34.400]  Is to market towards kids. He's actually marketed towards eight to 12 year olds just like little nos
[2:15:34.960 --> 2:15:36.160]  Absolutely
[2:15:36.160 --> 2:15:42.000]  Yeah, so this is the ceremony of the destruction of innocence that the croleons talked about and you'll notice there that
[2:15:42.000 --> 2:15:45.680]  Now imager of moloch there where he actually you eat the kids
[2:15:45.760 --> 2:15:50.080]  He's chewing up and eating your kids digesting and this is the promo stuff they put out
[2:15:50.800 --> 2:15:56.000]  And in no wonder that's what ended up happening. Uh, stay right there, jay dyer. It's thursday

[2:17:00.400 --> 2:17:02.400]  And I make the prediction
[2:17:02.880 --> 2:17:06.800]  That's gonna cost flooding. That's not a prediction. You know, it's a hurricane

[2:17:19.200 --> 2:17:22.240]  That's gonna starve tens of millions to death and now it all happened
[2:17:22.560 --> 2:17:28.320]  25 million extra dead hundreds of millions on the verge of starvation and the un that ordered it's running around being the savior
[2:17:29.040 --> 2:17:33.680]  Listen when the first world collapses the third world dies and now the first world's becoming the third world

[2:19:57.280 --> 2:20:19.280]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[2:20:28.240 --> 2:20:33.440]  It was the lucius trust that funded the un prayer room in
[2:20:34.800 --> 2:20:37.280]  new york city and the lucius trust is
[2:20:37.920 --> 2:20:39.920]  Got their address there at 666
[2:20:41.280 --> 2:20:48.640]  When they also funded common core and fuzzy math and they're funding the move in california to get rid of advanced math and other studies
[2:20:49.040 --> 2:20:51.520]  They want dumbed down controllable people
[2:20:52.720 --> 2:20:55.760]  In fact an in game 2.0. That was a short film. I did before dr.
[2:20:55.760 --> 2:20:57.760]  Copland who's in the film died
[2:20:58.000 --> 2:21:03.520]  He brings forward the documents showing in the 60s where they said we're going to bring back paganism and human sacrifice
[2:21:04.240 --> 2:21:08.080]  And teach people anti science so that they're unable to ever stand up against us
[2:21:10.000 --> 2:21:12.320]  Let the plan of love and light work out
[2:21:13.200 --> 2:21:18.400]  And that's the luciferians that are different from the satanists. They create barbarous murderous
[2:21:18.880 --> 2:21:20.880]  Evil groups that are selfish
[2:21:21.120 --> 2:21:23.920]  That's a weapon that then the luciferians wield
[2:21:23.920 --> 2:21:28.560]  But they see themselves as guardians of the universe. So jay dyer is the great researcher
[2:21:28.880 --> 2:21:31.120]  Why don't you start with that and then get into what happened last weekend?
[2:21:31.600 --> 2:21:33.600]  And it's really been a big wake-up call for people
[2:21:34.080 --> 2:21:36.560]  Explaining a luciferian versus a satanist
[2:21:38.880 --> 2:21:44.720]  Well, a lot of the satanic groups that are kind of publicly known that these like the pop culture satanist
[2:21:44.720 --> 2:21:48.880]  this is kind of an outer portico religion the indian ton levée kind of stuff and
[2:21:48.880 --> 2:21:54.800]  Uh, that's kind of just a pop thing that probably has a lot of intelligence control. I think uh, if I recall
[2:21:55.200 --> 2:22:00.400]  Antony levée himself worked for interpol as a kind of an informant or an asset for a while
[2:22:00.400 --> 2:22:03.840]  So a lot of these groups, especially cults typically have this kind of
[2:22:04.480 --> 2:22:09.760]  Front relationship to some intelligence ages. There's some kind of group that's you know, uh, fronting them
[2:22:10.560 --> 2:22:16.480]  And then they kind of have concentric circles where you have, you know, more powerful entities on the intercore that kind of control these
[2:22:16.480 --> 2:22:21.360]  Outer portico groups and you know, a lot of things are structured that way secret societies
[2:22:21.920 --> 2:22:26.320]  The mafia structure that way organized crime intelligence. They all have that same kind of structure
[2:22:26.800 --> 2:22:30.560]  And a lot of people don't know kind of the inner handlers of these outer groups
[2:22:30.880 --> 2:22:34.640]  And that's done on purpose and so I think a lot of these rappers and a lot of these people who
[2:22:35.120 --> 2:22:41.280]  They may or may not take it, you know, seriously, but the people above them some of them do and then the people above them
[2:22:41.280 --> 2:22:47.600]  Um, uh, really it's ultimately pragmatic, right? They want to figure out ways to manipulate and control people
[2:22:47.680 --> 2:22:52.480]  So if you look at for example, the concept art, um, you know, you talk often about
[2:22:52.800 --> 2:22:57.680]  People, you know, telling people ahead of time what they're going to do and that's there's many reasons why they do that
[2:22:57.760 --> 2:23:03.120]  They do that as a a way to uh, catatonically, you know, lobotomize people to freak them out. Uh,
[2:23:04.080 --> 2:23:06.080]  Program the subconscious
[2:23:06.320 --> 2:23:10.640]  Yeah, and also, uh, there's a key element to the for the people that do take it seriously
[2:23:10.640 --> 2:23:17.520]  They believe that a willing sacrifice is much more powerful than, you know, to do this, uh illegitimately or to, you know
[2:23:17.760 --> 2:23:21.520]  Well, it's always illegitimate. You know what? I mean, if I were to just kill somebody, it'd be different than
[2:23:22.240 --> 2:23:27.920]  Bating them into it. If you watch the the classic movie wicker man, you know, the whole point of that movie is that the
[2:23:28.160 --> 2:23:33.920]  He's a pure good man and they trick him to come and then willingly die trying to save children at the end
[2:23:34.080 --> 2:23:36.080]  Then they set him up and kill him
[2:23:36.080 --> 2:23:42.000]  Well, and and but they keep giving him clues right throughout the whole movie. They keep saying you're the rabbit. You're the sacrifice
[2:23:42.000 --> 2:23:45.600]  You're the one that's going to die. You're the john barley corn guy who's going to be
[2:23:46.080 --> 2:23:51.840]  Roasted at the end and he willingly goes into it consistently not paying attention to the clues that they're telling him
[2:23:52.240 --> 2:23:56.160]  And I think that that's viewed as a a will like a willed sacrifice
[2:23:56.240 --> 2:24:02.880]  I'm willing to go and so in other words in in terms of the concept art which is all just totally all seeing eyes
[2:24:02.880 --> 2:24:06.480]  Portals to hell as you said, uh, it's Saturn allian imagery
[2:24:06.480 --> 2:24:10.000]  There's even a concept art which has the the roller coaster, you know
[2:24:10.000 --> 2:24:14.400]  Going into the portal with an all-seeing eye and people just tumbling down into the hole
[2:24:15.040 --> 2:24:19.600]  In the concept art for astral world and if you look at the guy who did the concept art for astral world
[2:24:19.600 --> 2:24:22.960]  He previously did uh, for example the kardashians
[2:24:23.600 --> 2:24:28.720]  Christmas card which has you know satanic imagery has giant all-seeing eyes in the in the uh
[2:24:28.720 --> 2:24:34.480]  In the christmas cards that they send out and I think that again the function of these people is to be
[2:24:35.280 --> 2:24:37.520]  culture toxifiers culture controllers
[2:24:37.920 --> 2:24:45.760]  And they even throw it in your face in the art itself all the time because that makes you a willing sacrifice a willing victim a willing participant
[2:24:46.480 --> 2:24:52.640]  And much more dangerous than the the concert as you pointed out is what you talked about in the first hour
[2:24:53.120 --> 2:24:56.320]  I mean the real sacrifice of the youth is what they're about to do
[2:24:56.320 --> 2:25:00.960]  And so they believe that this phoenix from the flame that you see there. That's that bird
[2:25:01.040 --> 2:25:05.600]  That's the ordo alca the the the phoenix that arises out of the ashes of the old civilization
[2:25:05.600 --> 2:25:11.520]  You know Travis Scott has in his artwork all of this stuff about dystopia. He says the dystopia is now
[2:25:12.320 --> 2:25:14.960]  And the new world we're going to need an escape plan
[2:25:15.440 --> 2:25:19.520]  That mountain he calls it utopia mountain and it's the mountain that will be
[2:25:20.240 --> 2:25:23.680]  The the civilization that emerges after the great cataclysm
[2:25:23.680 --> 2:25:27.360]  That's his whole concept art his whole recent thing is all about
[2:25:28.000 --> 2:25:30.160]  What exists now has to be destroyed?
[2:25:30.720 --> 2:25:34.080]  And the new aon has to come in and and again a lot of these
[2:25:34.640 --> 2:25:39.280]  Rappers and this has been 20 30 years now a lot of the right not all of them and a lot of them
[2:25:39.840 --> 2:25:45.280]  Are serious about their satanism. They really believe they're going to be participating in this aon that there's going to be a new
[2:25:45.920 --> 2:25:49.440]  Civilization that's built after this great cataclysm great reset etc
[2:25:49.440 --> 2:25:52.960]  Um, you can go all the way back to the the 90s. I remember when I was in high school
[2:25:53.040 --> 2:25:58.880]  Everybody liked the Memphis rap scene and the Memphis rap scene was one of the first to have openly satanic artists
[2:25:58.960 --> 2:26:03.200]  Like the triple six mafia and so forth some of whom are you know, some of the biggest rappers out there
[2:26:03.200 --> 2:26:04.800]  Right juicy j right?
[2:26:04.800 --> 2:26:09.680]  So this is not new and then jc or just give me jz took it to a new level, you know about
[2:26:10.480 --> 2:26:16.800]  Mid-2000s where he openly started advocating crollianism wearing crollian attire, you know promoting that
[2:26:16.800 --> 2:26:20.960]  Uh, uh, uh, do with that will love under will etc
[2:26:21.440 --> 2:26:22.000]  um
[2:26:22.000 --> 2:26:29.280]  So rap as you know back to the 80s and 90s the mtv executive said was a an intentional warfare weapon
[2:26:29.360 --> 2:26:31.040]  It's a cultural warfare weapon
[2:26:31.120 --> 2:26:35.680]  And so they took gangster rap and turned it into a weapon to partly to help destroy
[2:26:36.160 --> 2:26:39.840]  The black community and we know that they did on purpose because it's come out even in mainstream media
[2:26:40.080 --> 2:26:43.600]  They've talked about that as as an and again the classic image of molok
[2:26:43.600 --> 2:26:47.760]  The bible says give not your children the fire of molok moloks in the new and old testament
[2:26:48.080 --> 2:26:53.280]  The mothers are leading their children in to be killed into the mouth be thrown to the fire
[2:26:53.760 --> 2:26:59.360]  I mean this is absolutely in your face 100 percent
[2:27:00.080 --> 2:27:02.080]  That's what they're doing
[2:27:02.080 --> 2:27:06.880]  And see you on the other side, which was one of the uh, uh catchphrases of this tour
[2:27:07.680 --> 2:27:09.680]  Is you know you tumbling into the portal
[2:27:09.680 --> 2:27:14.640]  Um, most of you not making it, right? So if if he sees you on the other side
[2:27:14.720 --> 2:27:17.520]  It means that you were part of his other song escape plan
[2:27:17.920 --> 2:27:24.560]  Which is how he's going to escape. He thinks the the coming cataclysm and be part of the utopia say these people literally believe that
[2:27:24.640 --> 2:27:28.160]  They're going to be part of the breakaway civilization utopia
[2:27:28.640 --> 2:27:34.240]  Again, he's you know in with he's married to one of one of the geners one of the kardashians. So, uh,
[2:27:34.880 --> 2:27:38.160]  You know, that's what all of these rituals are about these rituals are about
[2:27:38.160 --> 2:27:39.520]  um
[2:27:39.520 --> 2:27:45.920]  Escaping the coming cataclysm and being in that satanic aon and I covered that satanist essay that I believe is real
[2:27:45.920 --> 2:27:47.920]  I you know, I covered that a couple weeks ago
[2:27:48.000 --> 2:27:52.720]  On band dot video for you guys and that guy's essay says all of this stuff
[2:27:52.880 --> 2:27:58.400]  He said what 20 years ago, maybe 10 years ago 20 years whenever it was that he wrote that he said that these
[2:27:59.120 --> 2:28:02.640]  public pop performances are rituals to lower the
[2:28:02.640 --> 2:28:10.080]  Thought processes of the the the minds of the the masses to where they can't think about god or anything above
[2:28:10.320 --> 2:28:16.640]  Just base level desires so that they can be willing cattle sacrifices in the coming cataclysm
[2:28:18.080 --> 2:28:20.800]  You're absolutely right and I want to give people the rest of the story
[2:28:20.880 --> 2:28:22.160]  I know you know it
[2:28:22.160 --> 2:28:26.080]  When we come back there is a cataclysm coming and it's the fall of these people
[2:28:26.480 --> 2:28:30.960]  They're trying to spin it that oh, they're about to get rid of the old bad order and bring a new order
[2:28:30.960 --> 2:28:35.920]  No, this is the death of their old order and god christ new order is coming
[2:28:36.160 --> 2:28:39.840]  And they know it and they can feel it and they can see it god consciousness
[2:28:40.240 --> 2:28:45.040]  Humanity going to the next level as they're trying to suppress the chemicals the poison hitting our children everything
[2:28:45.360 --> 2:28:48.880]  Is their mad panic and it'll be all the satanists that are actually destroyed

[2:32:59.200 --> 2:33:01.920]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[2:33:01.920 --> 2:33:03.920]  Go
[2:33:14.880 --> 2:33:16.880]  This is a frontline report
[2:33:18.720 --> 2:33:24.640]  You are listening to an info wars dot com frontline report. It's alex jones
[2:33:25.680 --> 2:33:27.920]  Okay, and I don't say this to brag
[2:33:27.920 --> 2:33:32.640]  I don't say this to be cool, but I tried to have Luciferians recruit me when I was a very young teenager
[2:33:33.520 --> 2:33:38.560]  And then I had Hollywood try to recruit me and the stuff people know about me in Hollywood
[2:33:38.560 --> 2:33:43.160]  It's not even one-tenth of the stuff. Okay, I got taken to the top of it. It was actually the bottom of it
[2:33:43.160 --> 2:33:47.040]  I felt no presence of God. You could put a gun to my head
[2:33:47.040 --> 2:33:50.640]  I wouldn't join these people because I've got the whole experience and I'm not on some power trip either
[2:33:50.640 --> 2:33:51.680]  I'm just saying
[2:33:51.680 --> 2:33:57.040]  But when you hear them thinking they're being empowered look at little nos look at Travis Scott
[2:33:57.040 --> 2:34:01.840]  Look at Alistair Crowley. Look these people look at Madonna. She's a frickin joke
[2:34:02.760 --> 2:34:08.880]  They know their evil systems coming to an end. They know they're gonna be destroyed. They know God doesn't like them
[2:34:08.880 --> 2:34:11.680]  They know they're filthy. God sees them as filth
[2:34:12.520 --> 2:34:14.720]  They stink to high heaven spiritually
[2:34:15.600 --> 2:34:22.080]  And so they want to claw as many of us as they can with them and they're pushing all this as if this is in
[2:34:22.480 --> 2:34:25.120]  lightning a bunch of stupid weirdos
[2:34:25.120 --> 2:34:33.440]  Doing again a simulated march of Paul bearing humanity into a furnace and then and then trying to worship Madonna
[2:34:34.000 --> 2:34:39.080]  This washed-up joke and that's what they do everywhere. These people are a joke
[2:34:40.440 --> 2:34:47.840]  But the horrible inbred royalty and and and the Saxe-Coburg gophers and the Rothschilds and the rest of them are so hellishly
[2:34:47.960 --> 2:34:53.640]  Unhappy that they just love seeing everybody else miserable like they are because even though they're demonically possessed
[2:34:53.640 --> 2:35:01.560]  They're their cells aren't a human body that was made by God and so their very bodies are rebelling against them ladies and gentlemen
[2:35:01.760 --> 2:35:03.760]  That's why they're so physically ugly
[2:35:04.040 --> 2:35:11.440]  And and that's why they want to hurt us is is is they want to pull us down the level that they are at because we're falling
[2:35:11.440 --> 2:35:14.080]  But they're really falling spiritually completely
[2:35:14.520 --> 2:35:19.080]  They've chosen it and that's why all that flows from them is death and destruction and pain
[2:35:19.080 --> 2:35:26.840]  I mean you look at their high priests and priests. They are just weak sacks of filth and that's what you worship is
[2:35:27.160 --> 2:35:29.160]  weakness and stupidness and
[2:35:29.640 --> 2:35:31.640]  shallowness and patheticness
[2:35:31.640 --> 2:35:33.640]  And it's just absolutely
[2:35:34.840 --> 2:35:36.840]  The cult of losers
[2:35:37.320 --> 2:35:43.600]  So we know that this multi thousand year old ten thousand year old satanic world order is coming to an end
[2:35:43.600 --> 2:35:45.600]  They know it we know it
[2:35:45.600 --> 2:35:51.360]  And so they're targeting us with poison and toxins and everything else they can to try to lower us
[2:35:51.720 --> 2:35:59.000]  Interdimensionally, this is their own words to below even the third dimension. That's what the metaverse is is a false synthetic universe
[2:35:59.720 --> 2:36:04.680]  A lower dimension that they're trying to artificially capture a sin a digital hell a matrix
[2:36:05.160 --> 2:36:13.120]  To try to keep us from the transcendence that's now beginning and accelerating we're electrochemical energy creatures bottom physics
[2:36:13.120 --> 2:36:16.400]  It all proves it they know this that exist in all dimensions
[2:36:16.480 --> 2:36:25.920]  so this this this body is only an expression of our incredible higher dimensional power to then in the third dimension organize matter and energy into a
[2:36:27.080 --> 2:36:32.720]  Connectedness that is a form of time travel now. That's the big secret. So at the CERN superconducting super reactor
[2:36:32.880 --> 2:36:34.440]  Collider they want to open a gate
[2:36:34.440 --> 2:36:38.880]  They say she but the god of you know everything is there and all the secultism
[2:36:38.880 --> 2:36:46.360]  You know at the tunnel and then all the kids get killed in the crash and it's always the same and oh go into the Great Pyramid and conjuring
[2:36:46.360 --> 2:36:49.880]  A gray alien that tells him I'll make you a god just kill everyone
[2:36:50.200 --> 2:36:53.800]  Help me kill everyone and then you'll be given enlightenment and then and then
[2:36:54.200 --> 2:36:57.040]  Arthur C. Clark writes his books with the same story over and over again
[2:36:57.040 --> 2:37:00.360]  They're telling you this but they're really just pervert pedophiles
[2:37:00.400 --> 2:37:04.080]  They're really just fallen scum that made a deal with the lowest
[2:37:04.080 --> 2:37:11.520]  Creatures in the universe that chose to be away from God but have free will and so they can trick us to choose to join them
[2:37:11.520 --> 2:37:15.120]  With our free will as well. So just as CERN is the portal
[2:37:15.520 --> 2:37:19.280]  They are now opening the portal they open the portal in our minds
[2:37:19.280 --> 2:37:24.440]  That's how powerful we are and they're trying to suppress the fact that the true new age is coming
[2:37:24.440 --> 2:37:26.440]  So they're creating their false
[2:37:26.400 --> 2:37:30.760]  New age and artificial collapse they say because they know what collapse is coming
[2:37:30.760 --> 2:37:37.840]  So they want to have an artificial when they control to try to survive themselves. They are loser failures. Let's continue jade iron
[2:37:39.480 --> 2:37:42.400]  Well, if you think about some of the other big rappers again
[2:37:42.640 --> 2:37:49.600]  There's an image of ASAP Rocky who is a pretty well-known rapper in the last ten years and I mean he's openly done
[2:37:49.600 --> 2:37:55.840]  I don't think those are promotional images. I mean him and his his gang they literally, you know, are there they're doing I
[2:37:56.400 --> 2:37:59.120]  Don't know if this golden dawn or what kind of rituals they're doing
[2:37:59.120 --> 2:38:05.800]  But they're doing they're they're doing the magic rituals openly for everyone to see and then playing like oh, you know
[2:38:05.800 --> 2:38:10.000]  We don't really take this seriously, but then oh, actually, maybe we do because they you know
[2:38:11.240 --> 2:38:17.480]  Oftentimes they devolve the fact that they take it seriously. So really at that level it doesn't they're not the main players
[2:38:17.480 --> 2:38:24.960]  There's people way above them that you know have the real power and the real money and that's why this is again a cultural weapon
[2:38:24.960 --> 2:38:32.000]  And it's like you've been saying this this this last year and you've said it so often that I just really clicked with me
[2:38:32.000 --> 2:38:37.880]  The other day that if you understand that what's happening is a warfare then everything suddenly makes sense, right?
[2:38:37.880 --> 2:38:43.400]  It suddenly makes sense why they would want to you know inoculate everyone including infants
[2:38:43.400 --> 2:38:44.920]  It makes sense why
[2:38:44.920 --> 2:38:49.240]  Biden would want to shut down the country shut down the economy it makes sense why there's you know
[2:38:49.240 --> 2:38:55.200]  Just totally generosity and satanic rap everywhere. It's because they're trying to destroy the existing order
[2:38:55.960 --> 2:38:58.560]  Suddenly now, but I don't make sense, right? But if you don't have that
[2:38:59.240 --> 2:39:04.120]  Playbook then you're confused your loss. You're wondering and amazed. It's it's your hoodwink, right?
[2:39:04.120 --> 2:39:07.680]  But it's it's ironic that it's all out there in the open
[2:39:07.680 --> 2:39:14.040]  All right, it's all in our face and they're trying to fire the God particle proving there's interdimensionals and break dimensions
[2:39:14.040 --> 2:39:17.800]  That's their main mission because they've observed particles break dimensional
[2:39:17.800 --> 2:39:20.560]  Systems and go from particles to waves
[2:39:22.840 --> 2:39:28.680]  Right, I think that they they intentionally hide a lot of that tech as you know and you know if you look at Brave New World
[2:39:28.680 --> 2:39:34.960]  There's a section in the book where the world socials controller. He says that yeah, we know there's high meta higher metaphysical truths
[2:39:35.000 --> 2:39:37.880]  We know that there's a divinity and transcendence
[2:39:37.920 --> 2:39:45.200]  We intentionally hide that from the masses because we don't want them to know the power that they have that they would then be empowered
[2:39:45.200 --> 2:39:46.800]  We have to dumb them down
[2:39:46.800 --> 2:39:50.160]  We have to that's how he that's what he explains in the book
[2:39:50.160 --> 2:39:54.320]  So but there's out of sexually telling you right that that that's intentional and by the way
[2:39:54.320 --> 2:39:57.640]  I forgot to mention Travis Scott also did a metaverse concert
[2:39:58.040 --> 2:40:02.880]  There's the all-seeing eyes like you know that that are all over his concept art too by the way
[2:40:03.280 --> 2:40:08.320]  He did a metaverse concert for fortnight, which again is like the most popular game for you know
[2:40:08.320 --> 2:40:13.600]  8 to 12 year old 13 year olds and in that metaverse concert. That's about 12 minutes long
[2:40:13.600 --> 2:40:18.360]  He does a whole ritual where he basically becomes a giant
[2:40:19.240 --> 2:40:22.040]  He does a concert and then he ascends into space
[2:40:22.040 --> 2:40:28.800]  And then he ascends out of time and space like bowman going into the Stargate in 2001
[2:40:28.800 --> 2:40:33.960]  And so the whole message of yeah of that of that ceremony that ritual there in that
[2:40:34.360 --> 2:40:39.920]  That metaverse concert in fortnight is that he's a god among men and I don't know
[2:40:39.920 --> 2:40:43.800]  He actually references the Anunnaki and his songs quite often and then he
[2:40:44.320 --> 2:40:47.400]  Transcends into space and leaves the dimensions of the here and the now
[2:40:47.400 --> 2:40:52.320]  So this is just promoting the idea to the youth to kids people playing fortnight that you know
[2:40:52.320 --> 2:40:57.760]  They don't understand they're being programmed that the kids that are playing this game are the ones that are gonna live
[2:40:58.160 --> 2:41:05.400]  To when they inject they insert you into the matrix and let's go further even the writers for Prometheus admit
[2:41:05.400 --> 2:41:11.160]  Oh, we believe this is a real Genesis story that aliens did this and that this really happened and that the engineers are just
[2:41:11.280 --> 2:41:17.520]  Biological androids of a higher ascendant race to higher dimensions that we need to kill everybody first to save you know to save
[2:41:17.600 --> 2:41:24.080]  The planet and then we'll be able to ascend once we learn to kill everybody just these aliens just keep telling us to kill everybody
[2:41:24.080 --> 2:41:26.080]  It's so liberal
[2:41:26.560 --> 2:41:30.240]  Yeah, why do the clockwork elves always tell you to kill I mean this is I mean Terrence McKenna
[2:41:30.240 --> 2:41:35.520]  I write that the guy who popularized this and he was you know somewhat into these esoteric philosophies himself
[2:41:35.680 --> 2:41:37.000]  You know, he always said well
[2:41:37.000 --> 2:41:42.160]  We've just got to kill everybody because the mushroom says kill everybody and the elves told me to kill it now
[2:41:42.160 --> 2:41:47.120]  We're listening to people who are talking to demonic elves saying kill everybody literally
[2:41:47.520 --> 2:41:52.040]  And and that's it's not a joke, right? I mean they really believe that they're speaking to these
[2:41:52.920 --> 2:41:57.400]  Hold on let's come back for a break and talk about that but to explain if the ayahuasca rituals DMT all of it
[2:41:57.400 --> 2:42:02.120]  Most the time a little elf talks to you and then it says it really likes you but you're good
[2:42:02.120 --> 2:42:04.880]  You get to live but can you set up a world government kill everybody?
[2:42:04.880 --> 2:42:08.040]  Will you work with me to kill everybody and that's because they're demons folks
[2:42:08.720 --> 2:42:15.400]  Well, the rappers are not now they're all into LSD, right? Remember back in the 2000s like that was the chronic
[2:42:15.400 --> 2:42:17.280]  That's when rappers smoked weed right now
[2:42:17.280 --> 2:42:21.240]  The rappers all they do is pills and trip acid and they talk about it all the time
[2:42:21.240 --> 2:42:24.320]  They sing songs about tripping and tripping acid all that kind of stuff
[2:42:24.320 --> 2:42:30.360]  That's one of the easiest ways DMT the ayahuasca all that's the easiest way to contact what you're talking about and have these
[2:42:30.680 --> 2:42:33.600]  Experiences that they think are opening their third eye
[2:42:33.800 --> 2:42:39.160]  You know he uses this third eye images all the time Travis Scott and and they think that they've been given this message
[2:42:39.160 --> 2:42:42.720]  Like you said that they're going to a sin and and that they're gonna be part of this trans
[2:42:42.720 --> 2:42:48.280]  And it is we gotta go to break but it is opening the third eye so they can fry you permanently instead of transcend
[2:42:48.280 --> 2:42:55.280]  They're frying your third eye. That's what Satanism is. We'll be right back. Stay with us ladies and gentlemen

[2:45:08.560 --> 2:45:11.600]  Advising him on who these evil groups are
[2:45:12.320 --> 2:45:18.840]  They know that all over the world their poison shot is being banned by major governments and Moderna's in trouble as well
[2:45:19.520 --> 2:45:23.920]  They know that the people are starting to get wise this depopulation agenda
[2:45:23.920 --> 2:45:29.680]  In fact evidence is starting to mount that the shots were supposed to be soft-kill weapons, but they're so
[2:45:30.280 --> 2:45:35.600]  Deadly they're killing a higher percentage up front and so people are waking up
[2:45:36.040 --> 2:45:41.920]  The weapons work a little too good. They're supposed to be silent weapons for quiet wars
[2:45:41.920 --> 2:45:46.720]  But instead they're making too big of a noise, but it's too late for return back now
[2:45:47.000 --> 2:45:48.720]  They're coming after our children
[2:45:48.720 --> 2:45:54.640]  So it's up to us to protect our little children or God will not look favorably on us remember

[2:46:55.360 --> 2:47:07.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:47:13.240 --> 2:47:17.400]  To the town of our free who wrote a stranger one fine day
[2:47:19.600 --> 2:47:23.600]  Hardly spoke to folks around him didn't have too much to say
[2:47:23.600 --> 2:47:26.280]  Listen to what music was like in the forties and fifties
[2:47:27.560 --> 2:47:29.560]  Matter
[2:47:30.360 --> 2:47:32.560]  Man music or classical or country
[2:47:33.840 --> 2:47:35.840]  Any of that it was all just
[2:47:37.400 --> 2:47:39.400]  Uplifting empowering
[2:47:41.120 --> 2:47:43.120]  There were stories of good versus evil
[2:47:44.000 --> 2:47:46.720]  And now it's just discord insane
[2:47:48.080 --> 2:47:49.440]  hallucinations
[2:47:49.440 --> 2:47:53.960]  And I remember being on Joe Rogan's show like four years ago five years ago now
[2:47:53.960 --> 2:47:57.640]  I guess Trump had just gotten elected and it was the first time I was on the show
[2:47:57.640 --> 2:48:01.200]  But friends of them for everybody hadn't had me on it was episode 911 and
[2:48:02.080 --> 2:48:05.800]  Is 911th podcast they really bury that but still on YouTube and
[2:48:06.600 --> 2:48:13.800]  I was explaining hey George Soros has paid with the CIA to weaponize the strains of marijuana to make it more hallucinogenic
[2:48:13.800 --> 2:48:21.760]  To put people into a state of control and to create artificial schizophrenia and he thought I was crazy then well a couple years later
[2:48:21.760 --> 2:48:22.800]  Joe's like man, you're right
[2:48:22.800 --> 2:48:24.720]  It's all over the news people are schizophrenic now
[2:48:24.720 --> 2:48:29.120]  There's a lot of my friends who becomes schizophrenic and then they go from that into hallucinogens
[2:48:29.120 --> 2:48:33.520]  So you know and Joe's learning about this because you know he was like oh big psychedelic guy 10 15 years ago
[2:48:33.520 --> 2:48:37.240]  And then now he sees the effect on other weak-minded people. Yes
[2:48:37.240 --> 2:48:45.240]  Yes, LSD peyote mushrooms all of that stuff if you're in control of yourself and have a relationship with God
[2:48:46.080 --> 2:48:50.760]  You're the Hopi Indians take it and they don't really get demon possessed and I'm not saying take it
[2:48:50.760 --> 2:48:55.520]  Okay, but I'm not gonna lie to people. I've taken it. All right years ago a long time ago when I was a teenager
[2:48:55.520 --> 2:49:02.480]  I took quite a bit of it and the point is is that it definitely opens up all those gateways and that stuff and it's very real
[2:49:02.480 --> 2:49:09.600]  It destroys the the veil between but most people who are already subconscious and unconscious and into the occult
[2:49:10.800 --> 2:49:14.040]  Just through growing up in this culture. They don't even know they are
[2:49:14.280 --> 2:49:18.960]  They literally have no idea they're stepping through in another dimension that their brain is already in another dimension
[2:49:18.960 --> 2:49:24.400]  And they're giving these entities control over your mind and it's very very distraught see I took a lot
[2:49:24.400 --> 2:49:27.320]  But I've taken some of that stuff. Okay, and it was
[2:49:27.320 --> 2:49:35.040]  Definitely, you know in some of the cases not of this world and that stuff's very real ladies and gentlemen
[2:49:35.040 --> 2:49:39.280]  And I can tell you growing up that I knew people that worked in research laboratories
[2:49:39.840 --> 2:49:46.240]  separately in San Francisco for the government with drip DMT and all of it remember I told Joe Rogan that
[2:49:46.560 --> 2:49:53.280]  Years before it came out that University doing drip DMT and they came out right after I announced it because it was classified and they
[2:49:53.280 --> 2:49:58.160]  Wanted and released it and and so this is all very occultic all very esoteric
[2:49:58.160 --> 2:50:02.560]  I'm not involved in any of it, but like it's weird metaphysically. It's like I am though
[2:50:02.560 --> 2:50:08.560]  You understand it's like I met like the Illuminati level with these people and I'm not saying we want to be at that level
[2:50:08.560 --> 2:50:13.160]  But you once you have awareness you're you're where they are except you're not you're not going along with the plan
[2:50:13.160 --> 2:50:15.240]  And so they'll just say doesn't matter
[2:50:15.240 --> 2:50:18.520]  You're already part of the plan because you know then supposedly you're with them
[2:50:18.520 --> 2:50:24.220]  But that's a distinction between having being led by the Holy Spirit and being led by the spirit of this world
[2:50:24.280 --> 2:50:26.280]  Jay does that make any sense what I'm saying?
[2:50:27.560 --> 2:50:31.600]  Sure, I mean knowing about something doesn't mean that I willfully participated in it
[2:50:31.600 --> 2:50:38.560]  So I think that's a fallacy there. That's a non sequit. It doesn't follow from the fact that I know about serial killers that I'm a serial killer, right?
[2:50:39.480 --> 2:50:44.160]  But I mean there is a sense in which there is a kind of danger in that that knowledge
[2:50:44.160 --> 2:50:48.840]  Yeah, I mean a lot of people I think might want to experiment with these things and I wouldn't recommend it because you know
[2:50:48.840 --> 2:50:50.840]  I've had those same experiences too
[2:50:50.920 --> 2:50:53.680]  Which are pretty it can be pretty terrifying so
[2:50:54.680 --> 2:50:57.800]  Another thing to keep in mind too is that I think the Travis Scott event
[2:50:57.960 --> 2:51:00.480]  This is not the first time this type of thing has happened
[2:51:00.480 --> 2:51:04.920]  You had mentioned some other concerts and other places big venues mecca where people have been trampled
[2:51:04.920 --> 2:51:07.240]  But let's not forget that there was the you know
[2:51:07.240 --> 2:51:14.320]  Ultamont event which the Rolling Stones at that time had if I recall I've been recently introduced to people like Kenneth Anger who
[2:51:14.480 --> 2:51:21.400]  Himself was a cronian and one of the things that anger always promoted was doing performance art doing avant-garde art as a ritual
[2:51:21.640 --> 2:51:26.200]  So the idea that artists don't have that mindset is false, right?
[2:51:26.200 --> 2:51:30.000]  Did they do I mean this is no you're right before I study what happened over the weekend
[2:51:30.000 --> 2:51:32.200]  I said, oh, maybe maybe it was just the artist
[2:51:32.200 --> 2:51:36.480]  They didn't know but now that I researched that the people there they knew this this was a plan deal
[2:51:36.480 --> 2:51:40.440]  They said when we have dead bodies, we're gonna call them smurfs then on the shirt
[2:51:40.440 --> 2:51:44.640]  It shows blue blue children going into a door. They come out red meeting there
[2:51:44.640 --> 2:51:49.800]  You know there they've been transmuted into devils basically. I mean this looks like it was actually all premeditated
[2:51:51.320 --> 2:51:56.360]  Yeah, you know who knows to what degree the artists are I mean, I don't know but again
[2:51:56.360 --> 2:51:58.360]  I think it's worth asking these questions
[2:51:58.640 --> 2:52:03.800]  You know there were we do have again precedent in all in concerts of people being dosed for example
[2:52:03.800 --> 2:52:08.320]  That's happened in past concerts. The CIA was reportedly at some of those early
[2:52:08.720 --> 2:52:12.200]  60s concerts passing out LSD to see what it would do and
[2:52:12.960 --> 2:52:19.320]  Think for example of the idea of the dead head right the idea of the dead bearers and the dead skeletons as the idea
[2:52:19.320 --> 2:52:22.040]  You're dead in the head. Well Travis Scott has his own
[2:52:22.760 --> 2:52:27.960]  Interesting symbolic image, which is kind of like a doll head or a kid's head with the eyes exed out
[2:52:27.960 --> 2:52:34.800]  And he uses that quite often in his concerts and so again the artwork and it's just very ominous very creepy
[2:52:34.800 --> 2:52:41.640]  And we do have precedent for artists, you know thinking that their events are rituals. They really do view it that way
[2:52:43.200 --> 2:52:47.080]  So why is it building towards a crescendo? What do you expect to do?
[2:52:47.080 --> 2:52:51.280]  I mean obviously the great reset is their attempt to collapse society while posing as the saviors
[2:52:51.280 --> 2:52:58.080]  Yeah, I think that um this probably from his vantage point
[2:52:58.080 --> 2:53:02.240]  You know, he probably thought that if it was something that was a ritual that this would sort of mark his
[2:53:02.240 --> 2:53:05.240]  I mean he now will be famous for this right? It's kind of a mark
[2:53:05.240 --> 2:53:08.680]  I mean, I'm not trying to be again callous, but it's a marketing event
[2:53:08.680 --> 2:53:13.480]  Just like Altamont was for the Rolling Stones people will always remember this as like, you know
[2:53:13.480 --> 2:53:18.280]  He'll probably be the biggest star in the world now from the vantage point of the world. They're gonna promote this
[2:53:18.280 --> 2:53:23.600]  They're gonna, you know, he's gonna be famous for even though right now it's scandalous and he's having to apologize
[2:53:23.600 --> 2:53:29.240]  I mean, I think this was probably some that will seal his stardom for a long time
[2:53:30.160 --> 2:53:31.800]  Which is dangerous and scary
[2:53:31.800 --> 2:53:38.280]  But like you said, this is the crescendo is that most of the people that are participating in the evil it comes back around
[2:53:38.280 --> 2:53:44.640]  I mean Bolsheviks Stalin. I mean these people get rid of their minions first. That's the first people they go for
[2:53:44.640 --> 2:53:48.760]  So, you know, just because you have a lot of money doesn't necessarily mean you're gonna be part of this
[2:53:48.760 --> 2:53:55.320]  I think a lot of a lot of governors a lot of people that are in power a lot of a lot of these minions are gonna be fed into the
[2:53:55.320 --> 2:53:57.320]  grinder just as much as the
[2:53:57.320 --> 2:54:02.120]  The normies the muggles, you know, the peasants that the stars think that they're above
[2:54:02.680 --> 2:54:05.560]  I think they're all gonna, you know be be
[2:54:06.320 --> 2:54:10.280]  You know, every man will get what what do you offer an eye basically?
[2:54:10.280 --> 2:54:16.840]  God will render to each man according to his works basically what I'm trying to say so you're absolutely right and these people are just so
[2:54:17.120 --> 2:54:23.520]  Incredibly pathetic. I mean you look at the slaves of Satan whether it's the Clintons or these but they just look like hell
[2:54:23.520 --> 2:54:27.960]  I mean look at Soros all of them that they're just all but they all have that in love with themselves
[2:54:28.160 --> 2:54:32.080]  Look in their eye like they're not there because they're not there. They've been taken over
[2:54:33.400 --> 2:54:38.080]  Well, there's a couple instances that drive Scott was arrested for trying to get his
[2:54:38.080 --> 2:54:42.280]  Fans to riot to rage like he tries to get them to do mosh pit
[2:54:42.280 --> 2:54:46.000]  Which is weird because I when I was growing up mosh pits were what heavy metal dudes did
[2:54:46.000 --> 2:54:48.840]  But now it's now rappers do mosh pits, which is weird
[2:54:48.840 --> 2:54:53.400]  but I mean he tries to get them to destroy stuff and you know, you know do these kinds of
[2:54:54.120 --> 2:54:58.360]  Destructive things so again, I think that that that he had a perfect recipe for
[2:54:58.760 --> 2:55:03.560]  Getting these people into the scenario and it being hyped up. He tries to tell people to do this stuff
[2:55:03.560 --> 2:55:08.880]  And then you know, there was a weird part in the concert where people had told him
[2:55:08.880 --> 2:55:11.320]  And he did to be fair at one point say watch out
[2:55:11.320 --> 2:55:12.720]  There's an ambulance coming
[2:55:12.720 --> 2:55:19.720]  There's a one one part where he just sort of bends over and starts heaving and looking up and smiling with this really weird sort of creepy
[2:55:20.120 --> 2:55:21.880]  smile on his face
[2:55:21.880 --> 2:55:26.360]  Which is supposedly after people had you know alerted him to the fact that people were dying
[2:55:26.360 --> 2:55:32.760]  Oh, yeah, they're having convulsions and dying in front of him and he's out on a cherry picker out over them like just going oh
[2:55:33.880 --> 2:55:38.120]  Looking at the death with pleasure singing so happy going. Oh, yeah
[2:55:39.240 --> 2:55:45.160]  There's a specific point where he bends over and he sort of starts heaving and he looks up and he smiles and with a really creepy
[2:55:45.480 --> 2:55:52.800]  Looking smile. So again, whether he knew that was going on. I don't know but there's just too many things here, you know that that
[2:55:52.800 --> 2:55:59.720]  Raised serious questions and just makes me think of all time on it just makes me think of you know marketing rituals from the
[2:56:00.000 --> 2:56:03.960]  Managed point of the elite that the cult elite they see it all is the same thing, right?
[2:56:04.360 --> 2:56:08.840]  Rituals no different than mouse marketing. Mouse marketing is a ritual for them. Absolutely
[2:56:08.840 --> 2:56:15.680]  It's the projection of their will against us for us to kill each other and fall apart while the Luciferians sit back as the psychic
[2:56:15.680 --> 2:56:18.000]  Bomb destroys us. Let's do five more minutes. Jay Dyer

[3:00:04.880 --> 3:00:09.920]  I'll introduce our next guest coming up that I wanted to get to this news with him
[3:00:09.920 --> 3:00:13.760]  And I'll be covering this live tomorrow. He's gonna get the speech while we're on air
[3:00:13.760 --> 3:00:15.360]  I think it was the third hour
[3:00:15.360 --> 3:00:20.000]  Founder of the World Economic Forum also head of the Bilderberg group announces great narrative
[3:00:20.000 --> 3:00:25.760]  He's not gonna tell us he says until tomorrow, but we know what it is. It's the global greenhouse gas system
[3:00:25.760 --> 3:00:31.480]  It's use the lockdowns that we already had to quote save the earth further. It's a global carbon tax
[3:00:31.480 --> 3:00:35.640]  It's just their whole rollout that the world's terrible the world's ugly's bad
[3:00:35.640 --> 3:00:40.520]  It's because you've been bad and I've been bad and the rich have been bad
[3:00:40.520 --> 3:00:45.200]  But we're gonna give you all a world social credit score and a world rentee basic income
[3:00:45.200 --> 3:00:50.160]  If you just get behind us and the hundred and fifty trillion every decade in carbon taxes
[3:00:50.160 --> 3:00:57.120]  That's what he's gonna announce tomorrow. Jay Dyer. You want to speak to that got any predictions about what he's gonna say about the collaborative effort
[3:00:57.120 --> 3:00:59.120]  He's gonna unveil tomorrow
[3:00:59.320 --> 3:01:05.440]  Yeah, well in the fourth industrial revolution one of the elements I picked up on which I didn't expect was kind of odd was the
[3:01:05.440 --> 3:01:11.640]  Consistent usage of the idea of a new covenant and he was using this religious language was which I thought was a little odd
[3:01:11.640 --> 3:01:14.040]  But then you know more I thought about it the more it made sense
[3:01:14.040 --> 3:01:18.600]  I mean, I think Klaus is very aware of that to get the masses involved and on board
[3:01:18.720 --> 3:01:20.920]  It's much easier to have an engineered
[3:01:21.280 --> 3:01:28.680]  Steered religion right as the the ship that everybody jumps on to steer them into the portal that they want to take them down into
[3:01:28.680 --> 3:01:32.960]  Hell and you know Klaus said that this new covenant that will be again
[3:01:32.960 --> 3:01:40.320]  That's biblical language of the new covenant will be one where the new the new sins are confessing your eco crimes your carbon
[3:01:40.440 --> 3:01:45.440]  You know allotments going over your carbon allotments. That's the that's the new sin extinction rebellion type stuff
[3:01:45.440 --> 3:01:51.320]  So I think we can already postulate with quite a bit of certainty that this will be a religion rate based around
[3:01:52.080 --> 3:01:57.960]  Eco worship the green agenda and how really the problem for the planet is man himself
[3:01:57.960 --> 3:02:04.160]  And in order to save the planet right our saviors are going to have to you know massively reduce the population
[3:02:04.160 --> 3:02:08.440]  Which they're doing right now, so that's exactly what it'll be. That's right. They're going to pavlovian Lee
[3:02:08.920 --> 3:02:12.240]  Give people more on their social credit score and more on their universal income
[3:02:12.640 --> 3:02:18.640]  When they submit when they push propaganda when they get sterilized when they sterilize their children, they're going to be rock stars
[3:02:19.400 --> 3:02:25.160]  Doing this with all these different forms of human sacrifice with extinction rebellion always attacking blue-collar
[3:02:25.160 --> 3:02:30.380]  Trains and blue-collar highway areas and factories again attacking the general public
[3:02:31.160 --> 3:02:35.680]  This is the establishment and not wanting us to quote eat up their resources
[3:02:37.200 --> 3:02:39.800]  Yeah, somebody had sent me a clip where I think there was a
[3:02:40.800 --> 3:02:45.040]  To make an analogy here Travis Scott had told a fan one time who had climbed up a thing
[3:02:45.040 --> 3:02:49.600]  You know jump down and he jumped down and broke his leg or something like that
[3:02:49.600 --> 3:02:55.680]  I don't know exactly what this is what the case was but either the power of the system to just basically tell you to
[3:02:56.360 --> 3:02:58.840]  You know either risk your life or die for me
[3:02:59.400 --> 3:03:03.800]  Is the power that you know Klaus and these people love that's what they crave
[3:03:03.800 --> 3:03:06.960]  It's so they're literally pushing an entire system of death
[3:03:07.640 --> 3:03:14.320]  The new covenant a covenant of death actually is what Isaiah talks about that the wicked make a covenant with death thinking that they're
[3:03:14.320 --> 3:03:17.000]  Going to get life and then what do you know Satan tricks them?
[3:03:17.000 --> 3:03:22.920]  But all along right, you know saying has told you what he's going to do right? He's a liar. He's a he's a thief
[3:03:22.920 --> 3:03:25.560]  He comes to steal kill and destroy as Christ says so
[3:03:26.120 --> 3:03:29.160]  You know this whole new religion is really just
[3:03:29.920 --> 3:03:34.240]  Post-humanism and anti-anti natalism. That's the whole purpose of it. That's all it is
[3:03:34.240 --> 3:03:39.560]  And they'll do anything they can to convince you to not have kids to be sterile to
[3:03:40.440 --> 3:03:45.640]  Ultimately kill yourself. Yeah, just like false. I do you always use that analogy perfect analogy
[3:03:45.640 --> 3:03:47.640]  I come to me my child come come
[3:03:47.800 --> 3:03:54.280]  That's exactly what the system is doing on a macro scale and the pop stars just do it on a smaller scale
[3:03:56.360 --> 3:04:02.280]  Well well said Jay we really appreciate you and I'm glad that you're able to come on the broadcast and glad you host the 4th hour
[3:04:02.640 --> 3:04:06.520]  Sometime you need to come visit us in Austin soon. We got an open door for you and your wife
[3:04:06.800 --> 3:04:11.040]  And then we really appreciate all the fine work you're doing 30-second closing comment. I
[3:04:11.040 --> 3:04:16.200]  Would just remind people like you said that this is a scam. It's a trick. It's a tool
[3:04:16.200 --> 3:04:21.560]  It's obviously on the face of it evil, right? I mean evil doesn't benefit you in the long run
[3:04:21.560 --> 3:04:22.800]  There might be a short-term gain
[3:04:22.800 --> 3:04:26.320]  But you know you always have to pay the price and a lot of these people
[3:04:26.480 --> 3:04:32.720]  You know they're into forms of chaos magic chaos magic in terms of where it is now is about promoting transhumanism
[3:04:33.520 --> 3:04:39.400]  You know we just did an analysis of Manly P. Hall's book and the reason I bring him up is that he's one of these writers and occultists
[3:04:39.400 --> 3:04:43.760]  That they all look to and what's funny about Manly P. Hall is that he gives you all this esoteric stuff
[3:04:43.760 --> 3:04:46.800]  And then he ends it by saying by the way the solution is
[3:04:47.560 --> 3:04:53.600]  Socialist world government follow the UN so it's all just a tool for socialism and that's right just to get us out of the way
[3:04:53.600 --> 3:04:56.640]  It's a program to tell us. Thank you, Jay. I am cutting this announcement

[3:09:28.840 --> 3:09:36.160]  And really appreciate all that you've done and I know this is breaking your heart because you know those crap politicians on both sides
[3:09:36.160 --> 3:09:37.520]  of the aisle
[3:09:37.520 --> 3:09:44.960]  Those guys put their hand over their heart and recite the pledge and tell you America's broken and they're here to fix it and
[3:09:45.520 --> 3:09:47.520]  Then they stab you in the back
[3:09:47.520 --> 3:09:50.520]  You know and repeatedly turn us into a Marisuela
[3:09:51.040 --> 3:09:54.160]  Well, you have to add doctors to those lists now
[3:09:54.160 --> 3:10:00.120]  There are some good doctors many horrid ones and I am telling you we're going to be talking today with Dr.
[3:10:00.120 --> 3:10:06.280]  Brian Artis. He's going to be talking about monoclonal antibodies. They are really shoving this down people's throats
[3:10:06.320 --> 3:10:11.520]  They're bringing the military in to teach them how to administer this to all of you
[3:10:12.360 --> 3:10:16.480]  They're going to set up special bays everywhere like they're doing right now even in my own city
[3:10:17.280 --> 3:10:20.080]  It's pretty horrific because they're not telling you
[3:10:20.760 --> 3:10:23.120]  What the truth about monoclonal antibodies are?
[3:10:23.120 --> 3:10:28.760]  They're trying to get you to take this just like what you're going to you're going to trust pharma now
[3:10:29.240 --> 3:10:34.160]  Anyway, we're going to talk about remdesivir. We're going to talk about the truth about monoclonal antibodies
[3:10:34.160 --> 3:10:36.800]  I'm getting a lot of questions about these even on my own show
[3:10:37.040 --> 3:10:42.960]  People are emailing me like crazy and saying what is the deal with these things? Is it safe? It sounds safe
[3:10:43.280 --> 3:10:48.960]  No, it's anything but and wait till you hear the death rate the death rate percentage on those and then also
[3:10:48.960 --> 3:10:52.400]  Uh, what is the death rate of Medicare patients?
[3:10:53.760 --> 3:10:59.840]  On remdesivir that are given this drug and why you know, I played a tape yesterday on my own show bill gates
[3:11:00.240 --> 3:11:08.160]  Uh, it was talking about this was several years back and he was talking about how he was just breathing over the biggest problem that he saw
[3:11:09.280 --> 3:11:15.280]  And his biggest problem and all the emails he said he was getting because everyone's so concerned about overpopulation
[3:11:15.280 --> 3:11:21.520]  Was that he thought what could I do about overpopulation? I must do something
[3:11:22.240 --> 3:11:27.200]  And so in this clip he said, you know, we've designed these new medicines Melinda and I
[3:11:27.600 --> 3:11:32.080]  We wanted to get together and design new medicines so that we could give you these medicines
[3:11:32.640 --> 3:11:39.040]  And get this so that healthy people would not want would not choose to have kids anymore, right?
[3:11:39.280 --> 3:11:41.280]  They'll choose to have less kids
[3:11:41.520 --> 3:11:43.520]  because they'll be healthy
[3:11:43.520 --> 3:11:46.800]  Bill Gates, that's not a thing. That's not even a fact
[3:11:47.360 --> 3:11:51.120]  That's just a statement. You pulled out of your rear end. That isn't true
[3:11:51.760 --> 3:11:58.880]  In fact, uh, in fact, you know, when he was saying this it was we're going to reduce the population with our brand new
[3:11:59.360 --> 3:12:03.600]  Wonderful medicines. I know you've heard these clips. I know alex has probably played that clip
[3:12:03.920 --> 3:12:09.600]  But I was hoping to hear it again to kind of understand what's behind this movement a little bit more
[3:12:09.600 --> 3:12:16.720]  Because we're not getting that everything they shove in our faces now as some sort of remedy cure that's experimental
[3:12:16.960 --> 3:12:24.480]  That just flew into the marketplace is suddenly somehow going to save us and I really do hope that we're not
[3:12:25.360 --> 3:12:29.360]  Buying in to any of this because here's the bottom line and then I'll bring on Dr.
[3:12:29.440 --> 3:12:33.600]  Artis and he'll be telling you the facts about what is going on in this country with
[3:12:34.000 --> 3:12:36.000]  Monoclonal antibodies and deaths and everything else
[3:12:36.000 --> 3:12:41.760]  Uh, because you need we all need to hear the truth, but here's the bottom line takeaway that's going on right now
[3:12:41.840 --> 3:12:44.960]  Let's just let's just recap. Shall we in a really quick way?
[3:12:45.840 --> 3:12:48.640]  They stole all the money from social security years ago
[3:12:49.440 --> 3:12:51.440]  They didn't want to expose it, right?
[3:12:52.000 --> 3:12:57.120]  So then they uh, part of the reason that they concocted the lie of 2020 was to hide that fact
[3:12:57.360 --> 3:13:00.640]  It was in the works for years. It's a label diagnosis
[3:13:00.640 --> 3:13:05.840]  And they call it a mystery for a reason so that they could assign it drugs that have never been used before
[3:13:06.080 --> 3:13:12.240]  Like deadly remdesivir and lab created monoclonal antibodies straight from the Rockefellers. The NIH knew they were deadly
[3:13:12.640 --> 3:13:14.640]  They knew they were experimental
[3:13:14.640 --> 3:13:17.600]  But it was an emergency so no one asked why they chose these
[3:13:18.080 --> 3:13:23.040]  They had already invented the shot way before 2020 so it was ready to go
[3:13:23.360 --> 3:13:26.640]  They had the cure before even naming it. How's that even possible?
[3:13:26.640 --> 3:13:30.560]  They were hoping you wouldn't notice and it too was new and experimental
[3:13:30.960 --> 3:13:37.760]  This entire made-up circus was concocted to treat you for a respiratory cold flu or pneumonia that is in fact
[3:13:38.160 --> 3:13:41.760]  Extremely easy to treat always has been but fear works
[3:13:42.640 --> 3:13:48.000]  They divert your attention to fear so that you don't ask why they came up with this insane treatment or shot
[3:13:48.400 --> 3:13:51.680]  You're supposed to think that all the death is happening because of covid is not
[3:13:51.680 --> 3:13:56.240]  The press has to do backflips in order to ignore the death and reactions in the millions
[3:13:57.040 --> 3:14:02.320]  If you get the shot, you're not counted in the group for 15 days after when has that ever happened in history?
[3:14:02.560 --> 3:14:05.520]  So that they don't have to explain your adverse reaction. That's why
[3:14:06.080 --> 3:14:06.800]  Or death
[3:14:07.280 --> 3:14:12.400]  Bottom line, they stole your money. They don't want you to storm the gates. So they just instilled fear
[3:14:12.880 --> 3:14:14.880]  And they and they convinced you
[3:14:15.280 --> 3:14:17.760]  That you were in a plague of epic proportions
[3:14:17.760 --> 3:14:21.280]  Even though you knew it and hasn't been going on because you're not witnessing it
[3:14:22.240 --> 3:14:25.760]  So that you would accept all the collateral damage of the deaths
[3:14:26.480 --> 3:14:32.720]  No one's actually dying from a cold or pneumonia. It's their treatment causing the deaths. It's their treatment
[3:14:33.680 --> 3:14:35.680]  It's the shot that's causing the deaths
[3:14:36.080 --> 3:14:39.040]  It's like cutting your arm off to solve an infection in your finger
[3:14:39.840 --> 3:14:44.160]  Respiratory for a hundred years is only treated two different ways bacterial or
[3:14:44.160 --> 3:14:47.600]  Or viral not rocket science easily treatable
[3:14:48.160 --> 3:14:52.720]  But they're convincing you it's new and deadly and scary. So they'll take their insane shot and insane treatment
[3:14:53.600 --> 3:14:58.560]  And getting rid of you is easier if you are voluntarily subjecting yourself
[3:14:59.280 --> 3:15:01.760]  For this then they'll never have to do it by force
[3:15:02.480 --> 3:15:04.480]  It's all about money and control. We all know this
[3:15:05.200 --> 3:15:09.360]  And there's way more to it because we know that a lot of our future is held in the
[3:15:09.360 --> 3:15:14.720]  Factor that they wanted in every arm. They're desperate. They're so beyond desperate that it's becoming pathetic
[3:15:15.760 --> 3:15:21.280]  Our tax dollars are being used to bribe everyone into shoring up this law or this lie
[3:15:21.840 --> 3:15:25.360]  And hospitals are being paid to buy into these laws. I mean life
[3:15:26.720 --> 3:15:31.360]  I can get it right. So I'm going to bring on Dr. Artis and let me just tell you
[3:15:32.080 --> 3:15:35.600]  There's so much to know about monoclonal antibodies. Stay away from
[3:15:35.600 --> 3:15:43.600]  Beware and this is the show to tell you about it. I'm really happy to be here. I'm kate daly your guest host kate daly radio dot com
[3:15:43.600 --> 3:15:50.240]  I'm live after this for three hours, and I'll be right back. I'll be right back. We'll be talking about this. You'll want to hear this
[3:15:51.200 --> 3:15:55.600]  Ultimate bone broth is if a hurricane is smashing into the gulf coast
[3:15:56.400 --> 3:15:58.400]  And I make the prediction
[3:15:58.960 --> 3:16:01.520]  But it's going to cause flooding. That's not a prediction
[3:16:01.520 --> 3:16:06.320]  But it's going to cause flooding. That's not a prediction. You know, it's a hurricane. You know, it's got a lot of water
[3:16:06.320 --> 3:16:08.320]  It's going to dump. It's going to cause flooding
[3:16:08.320 --> 3:16:14.320]  So it wasn't a prediction 20 months ago when I said the un order to lock down the world economy
[3:16:14.320 --> 3:16:17.920]  It's going to cause a chain reaction that's going to cause supply chain problems for years
[3:16:17.920 --> 3:16:24.320]  And it's going to starve tens of millions to death and now it all happened 25 million extra dead hundreds of millions on the verge of starvation
[3:16:24.320 --> 3:16:27.520]  And the un that ordered it's running around being the savior
[3:16:27.520 --> 3:16:32.720]  Listen when the first world collapses, the third world dies and now the first world's becoming the third world
[3:16:32.720 --> 3:16:36.320]  So listen to me now. We've got the highest quality storeable foods

[3:17:55.520 --> 3:18:04.520]  The CEO of Pfizer just came out and said that people talking bad about the vaccines are working for quote dark forces
[3:18:04.520 --> 3:18:11.520]  The FBI and CIA have been advising him on who these evil groups are
[3:18:11.520 --> 3:18:18.520]  They know that all over the world their poison shot is being banned by major governments and Moderna's in trouble as well
[3:18:18.520 --> 3:18:23.520]  They know that the people are starting to get wise this depopulation agenda
[3:18:23.520 --> 3:18:32.520]  In fact evidence is starting to mount that the shots were supposed to be soft kill weapons but they're so deadly they're killing a higher percentage up front
[3:18:32.520 --> 3:18:35.520]  And so people are waking up
[3:18:35.520 --> 3:18:38.520]  The weapons work a little too good
[3:18:38.520 --> 3:18:43.520]  They're supposed to be silent weapons for quiet wars but instead they're making too big of a noise
[3:18:43.520 --> 3:18:46.520]  But it's too late for a return back now
[3:18:46.520 --> 3:18:48.520]  They're coming after our children
[3:18:48.520 --> 3:18:53.520]  So it's up to us to protect our little children or God will not look favorably on us
[3:18:53.520 --> 3:18:56.520]  Remember God is watching

[3:20:11.520 --> 3:20:15.520]  Hi there, back with you, Kate Galley, your guest host from The Kate Galley Show
[3:20:15.520 --> 3:20:16.520]  So happy to be here
[3:20:16.520 --> 3:20:21.520]  And also, I just wanted to mention, I have Dr. Brian Artis, which I'm very happy about
[3:20:21.520 --> 3:20:25.520]  Because man, what a champion in bringing things to light
[3:20:25.520 --> 3:20:28.520]  And also letting people know about the treatment protocol
[3:20:28.520 --> 3:20:30.520]  He was the first doctor to do this
[3:20:30.520 --> 3:20:32.520]  And then also with Remdesivir, of course
[3:20:32.520 --> 3:20:36.520]  And then also, we're going to be talking about monoclonal antibodies
[3:20:36.520 --> 3:20:43.520]  Because this is the latest attempt to try to get everybody into this particular treatment
[3:20:43.520 --> 3:20:45.520]  As a curell, as a remedy
[3:20:45.520 --> 3:20:48.520]  And we're going to be talking to Dr. Brian Artis
[3:20:48.520 --> 3:20:51.520]  Dr. Artis, are you there?
[3:20:51.520 --> 3:20:52.520]  I'm here, how are you?
[3:20:52.520 --> 3:20:53.520]  Perfect
[3:20:53.520 --> 3:20:56.520]  I'm good, how are you doing?
[3:20:56.520 --> 3:20:57.520]  Excellent
[3:20:57.520 --> 3:20:58.520]  Doing very good
[3:20:58.520 --> 3:21:02.520]  I'm at the reawaken toward same clinic
[3:21:02.520 --> 3:21:03.520]  Perfect, I'm so glad
[3:21:03.520 --> 3:21:06.520]  We need to bring a lot of awareness and we need to wake a lot of people up out there
[3:21:06.520 --> 3:21:07.520]  And I'm glad you're doing it
[3:21:07.520 --> 3:21:09.520]  You're the right person to do this
[3:21:09.520 --> 3:21:13.520]  Tell us about monoclonal antibodies
[3:21:13.520 --> 3:21:18.520]  Yeah, so I've had concerns about monoclonal antibodies from the very beginning
[3:21:18.520 --> 3:21:24.520]  Even when they surfaced to start be suggested that they could be a cure for early treatment source for COVID-19
[3:21:24.520 --> 3:21:29.520]  And the reason being is most people know me because I blew the whistle on Remdesivir
[3:21:29.520 --> 3:21:38.520]  Being chosen as the experimental antiviral to be used on all 100% of Americans that were hospitalized for COVID-19
[3:21:38.520 --> 3:21:41.520]  And that's an extremely dangerous drug
[3:21:41.520 --> 3:21:49.520]  The whole reason why monoclonal antibodies is even being discussed is because in the same trial that Anthony Fauci said
[3:21:49.520 --> 3:21:54.520]  Monoclonal antibodies and Remdesivir were proven to be safe and effective against Ebola virus
[3:21:54.520 --> 3:21:56.520]  It was in an Ebola trial
[3:21:56.520 --> 3:22:01.520]  And it was Remdesivir compared to three different monoclonal antibodies
[3:22:01.520 --> 3:22:08.520]  It was Remdesivir, ZMAP, which was put in by our United States Department of Health and Human Services
[3:22:08.520 --> 3:22:13.520]  It was also MAB114 that was put in by DARPA
[3:22:13.520 --> 3:22:17.520]  And then the fourth monoclonal antibody is the one you're hearing the most about in the media
[3:22:17.520 --> 3:22:19.520]  And it's called Regeneron
[3:22:19.520 --> 3:22:25.520]  These are not brand new ideas or treatments, they are antibodies that were also used against Ebola
[3:22:25.520 --> 3:22:29.520]  And what they found, this is the disgusting part for me
[3:22:29.520 --> 3:22:34.520]  And the very hard rationale for me to why we would use them against coronavirus
[3:22:34.520 --> 3:22:42.520]  Kate, less than 1% of the entire world who was infected with SARS-CoV-2 ends up dying from COVID
[3:22:42.520 --> 3:22:45.520]  Now, that's less than 1% mortality
[3:22:45.520 --> 3:22:51.520]  In the Ebola virus trial, that is the supportive study for why we're using Remdesivir
[3:22:51.520 --> 3:22:55.520]  And why these monoclonal antibodies are being suggested
[3:22:55.520 --> 3:22:57.520]  My problem was this
[3:22:57.520 --> 3:23:01.520]  Remdesivir had a mortality rate of 54.1%
[3:23:01.520 --> 3:23:03.520]  Or 53.1%
[3:23:03.520 --> 3:23:08.520]  Each of the monoclonal antibodies in order had mortality rates in the Ebola trial
[3:23:08.520 --> 3:23:14.520]  Of 49.7% that was ZMAP, which was a triple monoclonal antibody
[3:23:14.520 --> 3:23:22.520]  The second was actually called MAB114 and it had a death rate of 35% of all Ebola virus patients treated
[3:23:22.520 --> 3:23:28.520]  The Regeneron triple monoclonal antibody put in by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals
[3:23:28.520 --> 3:23:33.520]  It had a death rate in the actual Ebola trial of 33%
[3:23:33.520 --> 3:23:41.520]  I don't understand why we are actually even looking at a study of any drugs that have a mortality rate
[3:23:41.520 --> 3:23:46.520]  Higher than the less than 1% that the virus is actually causing
[3:23:46.520 --> 3:23:48.520]  To me, it makes it zero sense
[3:23:48.520 --> 3:23:51.520]  I do have concerns with the monoclonal antibodies
[3:23:51.520 --> 3:23:55.520]  They do have mortality rates better than Remdesivir
[3:23:55.520 --> 3:24:00.520]  So if you had to just pick between those two evils, go with monoclonal antibodies
[3:24:00.520 --> 3:24:03.520]  I don't know if you know this, Kate, your audience should know
[3:24:03.520 --> 3:24:10.520]  There's actually five studies in which antibodies that are directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2
[3:24:10.520 --> 3:24:14.520]  Or any of its variants, which is what monoclonal antibodies are
[3:24:14.520 --> 3:24:18.520]  They are linked to autoimmune diseases in the body
[3:24:18.520 --> 3:24:25.520]  And you are putting tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of these antibodies into a body with an injection
[3:24:25.520 --> 3:24:30.520]  And those antibodies are known to be seeking spike proteins in the body
[3:24:30.520 --> 3:24:36.520]  And when they find anything that looks like spike proteins, which is the epithelial cells of the lungs
[3:24:36.520 --> 3:24:39.520]  It's the actual gut lining
[3:24:39.520 --> 3:24:45.520]  We know these antibodies target the actual genes that lead to celiac disease
[3:24:45.520 --> 3:24:50.520]  Hashimoto's disease, which is autoimmune hypothyroiditis
[3:24:50.520 --> 3:24:57.520]  We already know the research studies prove that antibodies against spike proteins, which is what monoclonal antibodies do
[3:24:57.520 --> 3:25:04.520]  On their own, they target exactly the same tissues that the Salk Institute figured out
[3:25:04.520 --> 3:25:09.520]  Spike proteins damage, which out of 55 tissues in the human body
[3:25:09.520 --> 3:25:18.520]  Spike proteins and the antibodies that attack spike proteins damage and cause diseases of 28 different tissues in the body
[3:25:18.520 --> 3:25:23.520]  Including the brain, and we know the antibodies, including monoclonal antibodies
[3:25:23.520 --> 3:25:30.520]  And directly cause demyelination of nerve tissue, which is called multiple sclerosis
[3:25:30.520 --> 3:25:35.520]  So there is neurological inflammation and damage from the spike proteins and antibodies
[3:25:35.520 --> 3:25:39.520]  There's kidney inflammation and disease caused by them
[3:25:39.520 --> 3:25:45.520]  Gut lining issues like ulcerative paritis, Crohn's disease, celiacs, IBS
[3:25:45.520 --> 3:25:50.520]  All of these are known side effects in five to six different research studies we know
[3:25:50.520 --> 3:25:57.520]  About monoclonal antibodies that target spike proteins on their own, causing disease
[3:25:57.520 --> 3:26:04.520]  It's almost unbelievable because they keep saying the words safe and effective, safe and effective
[3:26:04.520 --> 3:26:09.520]  And you know, the FDA document that describes monoclonal antibodies, they actually say
[3:26:09.520 --> 3:26:15.520]  The limitations are you should not give this to anyone hospitalized with COVID
[3:26:15.520 --> 3:26:19.520]  And they're giving it to people that are hospitalized with COVID
[3:26:19.520 --> 3:26:25.520]  So you could be healthy and you could walk out, right, of a dose of monoclonal antibodies
[3:26:25.520 --> 3:26:30.520]  But it's what it's doing to your system and to your immune system long term
[3:26:30.520 --> 3:26:34.520]  Is one of the problems that they're not talking about, correct?
[3:26:34.520 --> 3:26:39.520]  Yeah, Kate, the actual cells they get monoclonal antibodies from
[3:26:39.520 --> 3:26:42.520]  They're actually called hybrid omas
[3:26:42.520 --> 3:26:45.520]  Do you know where they get those cells from?
[3:26:45.520 --> 3:26:47.520]  B cells from cancer cells
[3:26:47.520 --> 3:26:52.520]  These are actually derived from cancer lines from B cells outside of spleens
[3:26:52.520 --> 3:26:57.520]  And we know that they can actually create long term the development
[3:26:57.520 --> 3:27:01.520]  For the stages of every known cancer in the human body
[3:27:01.520 --> 3:27:06.520]  You're not going to see the detrimental issues like myocarditis from the COVID-19 shots
[3:27:06.520 --> 3:27:08.520]  In seven days, like we're seeing with teenagers
[3:27:08.520 --> 3:27:14.520]  These monoclonal antibodies can initiate disease processes that will continue to perpetuate
[3:27:14.520 --> 3:27:17.520]  Disease processes where we start to become aware of them with symptoms
[3:27:17.520 --> 3:27:21.520]  They can be three years down the road, five years down the road
[3:27:21.520 --> 3:27:24.520]  So it's great to know, I would say it's great
[3:27:24.520 --> 3:27:28.520]  That people receiving monoclonal antibodies, they're going home after five to seven days
[3:27:28.520 --> 3:27:30.520]  It's better than them being dead
[3:27:30.520 --> 3:27:36.520]  30% of all people being treated with remdesivir older the age of 65 in hospitals
[3:27:36.520 --> 3:27:41.520]  It's 26.9% of all of them die in American hospitals from remdesivir poisoning
[3:27:41.520 --> 3:27:45.520]  Is it better that they get to live a little bit longer with monoclonal antibodies?
[3:27:45.520 --> 3:27:49.520]  Yes, is it better that they have a better survival rate than remdesivir?
[3:27:49.520 --> 3:27:50.520]  Absolutely
[3:27:50.520 --> 3:27:52.520]  What is my concern?
[3:27:52.520 --> 3:27:53.520]  My concern is this
[3:27:53.520 --> 3:27:58.520]  There is only one drug in the entire world for its entire lifetime of use
[3:27:58.520 --> 3:28:01.520]  Has gone around the world for four decades
[3:28:01.520 --> 3:28:09.520]  And has a lower mortality rate than the actual virus in any of its COVID-19 variants
[3:28:09.520 --> 3:28:12.520]  And that one drug, Kate, is ivermectin
[3:28:12.520 --> 3:28:15.520]  Ivermectin has a less than 1% mortality rate
[3:28:15.520 --> 3:28:18.520]  It's better than the death rate from SARS-CoV-2
[3:28:18.520 --> 3:28:24.520]  Why are we considering any other drugs when ivermectin has 63 different studies
[3:28:24.520 --> 3:28:30.520]  From 18 different countries proving that in 24 to 48 hours
[3:28:30.520 --> 3:28:34.520]  It stops the COVID-19 disease process and stops its transmission
[3:28:34.520 --> 3:28:37.520]  Because it's a huge mystery
[3:28:37.520 --> 3:28:42.520]  It's a huge mystery killer plague disease that's airborne that's going to get you
[3:28:42.520 --> 3:28:44.520]  And I'm going to come right back with Dr. Brian Artis
[3:28:44.520 --> 3:28:45.520]  Don't go anywhere
[3:28:45.520 --> 3:28:48.520]  You're going to want to hear the rest of this, we have a lot to say
[3:29:15.520 --> 3:29:18.520]  Chicken broth protein, turmeric root that's so amazing
[3:29:18.520 --> 3:29:22.520]  Chaga mushroom, bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder
[3:29:22.520 --> 3:29:26.520]  And it's got added magnesium and potassium for electrolytes
[3:29:26.520 --> 3:29:31.520]  It's got real organic cocoa bean powder with natural chocolate flavor
[3:29:31.520 --> 3:29:34.520]  And a touch of sea salt that even tastes better than the last formula
[3:29:34.520 --> 3:29:37.520]  And what it does for your body is simply amazing
[3:29:37.520 --> 3:29:42.520]  And again, it has that cutting edge chicken broth protein, isolate powder
[3:29:42.520 --> 3:29:45.520]  For better flavor and solvability, you're going to love this
[3:29:45.520 --> 3:29:47.520]  And what it does for your joints, what it does for your body
[3:29:47.520 --> 3:29:49.520]  What it does for your bones is simply amazing

[3:33:24.520 --> 3:33:40.520]  Kate Dalley, your guest host
[3:33:40.520 --> 3:33:54.520]  Kate Dalley, your guest host
[3:33:54.520 --> 3:34:00.520]  Kate Dalley, your guest host
[3:34:00.520 --> 3:34:06.520]  Kate Dalley, your guest host
[3:34:06.520 --> 3:34:12.520]  It's called c19early.com, c19early.com.
[3:34:12.520 --> 3:34:14.080]  It gets updated daily.
[3:34:14.080 --> 3:34:17.360]  I would recommend everybody go to the third chart on that page
[3:34:17.360 --> 3:34:19.520]  every day that gets updated.
[3:34:19.520 --> 3:34:23.360]  It looks at research studies from hospitalized COVID-19
[3:34:23.360 --> 3:34:26.560]  patients from around the world, and it compares on that third
[3:34:26.560 --> 3:34:29.000]  chart all mortality results.
[3:34:29.000 --> 3:34:32.800]  And it shows you which experimental medications, which
[3:34:32.800 --> 3:34:38.200]  research items, nutrients like iodine, vitamin C, vitamin
[3:34:38.200 --> 3:34:42.000]  D, and they compare those medications, supplements,
[3:34:42.000 --> 3:34:44.400]  you name it, against all of each other
[3:34:44.400 --> 3:34:46.440]  to look for what has the greatest success
[3:34:46.440 --> 3:34:48.800]  rate at getting people out of hospital.
[3:34:48.800 --> 3:34:50.520]  And I want to focus on the chart which you've
[3:34:50.520 --> 3:34:51.960]  got on the screen right now.
[3:34:51.960 --> 3:34:55.720]  Everyone should notice that at the bottom of this third chart,
[3:34:55.720 --> 3:34:58.520]  at the near the bottom, like the fifth or sixth from the bottom
[3:34:58.520 --> 3:34:59.840]  is remdesivir.
[3:34:59.840 --> 3:35:02.280]  And remdesivir, which is the only drug being used
[3:35:02.280 --> 3:35:05.800]  in the United States of America in every hospital for COVID-19,
[3:35:05.800 --> 3:35:09.280]  and in Brazil is the only drug being used in all Brazil.
[3:35:09.280 --> 3:35:11.400]  And these two countries have the highest death
[3:35:11.400 --> 3:35:16.480]  rates, Kate, of all deaths of COVID around the world.
[3:35:16.480 --> 3:35:18.880]  We're the only two countries using remdesivir.
[3:35:18.880 --> 3:35:21.600]  And what's the percentage of success of remdesivir getting
[3:35:21.600 --> 3:35:23.720]  people out of hospitals with COVID-19?
[3:35:23.720 --> 3:35:26.360]  Read the percentage there, Kate.
[3:35:26.360 --> 3:35:28.560]  Oh my gosh, 19%.
[3:35:28.560 --> 3:35:29.800]  19%.
[3:35:29.800 --> 3:35:30.840]  Now look at the cost.
[3:35:30.840 --> 3:35:31.560]  Go to the right.
[3:35:31.560 --> 3:35:34.280]  What does it cost, on average, for a five-day treatment
[3:35:34.280 --> 3:35:36.480]  of remdesivir?
[3:35:36.480 --> 3:35:40.440]  3,120 dollars.
[3:35:40.440 --> 3:35:42.040]  Now I want you to scroll up to the top.
[3:35:42.040 --> 3:35:43.800]  It only has a 19% for sixth success rate.
[3:35:43.800 --> 3:35:45.120]  Let's go to the top of that graph.
[3:35:45.120 --> 3:35:46.840]  Everyone needs to watch this.
[3:35:46.840 --> 3:35:50.480]  I want you to get to povidone iodine at the top.
[3:35:50.480 --> 3:35:52.320]  It's like the fifth one down.
[3:35:52.320 --> 3:35:54.920]  It has an 88% success rate.
[3:35:54.920 --> 3:35:56.800]  And what they found in this research study
[3:35:56.800 --> 3:36:00.000]  was the viral loads for SARS-CoV-2
[3:36:00.000 --> 3:36:02.280]  is mostly found in the respiratory tract,
[3:36:02.280 --> 3:36:04.640]  your nasal septum, and in your throat.
[3:36:04.640 --> 3:36:08.680]  And when you used povidone iodine and used a nasal spray of it
[3:36:08.680 --> 3:36:13.240]  twice a day into the nose and then garbled it twice,
[3:36:13.240 --> 3:36:16.840]  two times, hospitalized patients for COVID-19,
[3:36:16.840 --> 3:36:21.040]  went home totally clear of COVID, 88% of the time.
[3:36:21.040 --> 3:36:26.280]  And look at the cost for a treatment of iodine.
[3:36:26.280 --> 3:36:27.800]  A dollar, a whole buck.
[3:36:27.800 --> 3:36:30.240]  Wow.
[3:36:30.240 --> 3:36:31.240]  Oh my god.
[3:36:31.240 --> 3:36:33.240]  A whole dollar.
[3:36:33.240 --> 3:36:36.880]  All right, so that's the fifth success rate.
[3:36:36.880 --> 3:36:39.320]  You hear all the time on Alex Jones' show at InfoWars,
[3:36:39.320 --> 3:36:41.960]  you hear about the benefits and pluses of iodine.
[3:36:41.960 --> 3:36:46.680]  I have used povidone iodine for like 20 years in practice.
[3:36:46.680 --> 3:36:49.240]  I use it as a sore throat gargle for strip throats.
[3:36:49.240 --> 3:36:51.320]  There's an amazing way to mix that.
[3:36:51.320 --> 3:36:52.560]  I'll give you what I did.
[3:36:52.560 --> 3:36:53.880]  Everyone should probably do it.
[3:36:53.880 --> 3:36:56.760]  But you take four drops of povidone iodine
[3:36:56.760 --> 3:37:00.040]  in eight ounces of water or 12 ounces of water,
[3:37:00.040 --> 3:37:03.560]  one heaping tablespoon of sea salt,
[3:37:03.560 --> 3:37:08.560]  and then add one tablespoon of hydrogen peroxide and gargle it.
[3:37:08.560 --> 3:37:11.960]  This is such an effective antiviral cleanser
[3:37:11.960 --> 3:37:14.880]  that helps remove any sore throat symptoms
[3:37:14.880 --> 3:37:17.560]  in 48 hours or less, even with strip throat.
[3:37:17.560 --> 3:37:20.760]  It's also been proven to be super effective against COVID.
[3:37:20.760 --> 3:37:21.880]  I would use this as a resource.
[3:37:21.880 --> 3:37:25.040]  Now, I need you to know, Kate, on that chart,
[3:37:25.040 --> 3:37:27.880]  povidone iodine was actually number one
[3:37:27.880 --> 3:37:29.920]  up until about two weeks ago.
[3:37:29.920 --> 3:37:32.800]  And now you're seeing things on top of that list,
[3:37:32.800 --> 3:37:34.800]  all of which are experimental drugs
[3:37:34.800 --> 3:37:37.560]  being produced by Pfizer and Merck.
[3:37:37.560 --> 3:37:40.200]  And these are from their studies, the ones above there.
[3:37:40.200 --> 3:37:43.160]  And I need to talk about the one that's at number two.
[3:37:43.160 --> 3:37:46.760]  You'll see a 95% success rate with anti-androgens.
[3:37:46.760 --> 3:37:47.840]  Do you see that?
[3:37:47.840 --> 3:37:49.400]  Mm-hmm, sure.
[3:37:49.400 --> 3:37:51.800]  I don't know if your audience knows this,
[3:37:51.800 --> 3:37:52.680]  but look at the cost.
[3:37:52.680 --> 3:37:56.000]  It costs five bucks for an anti-androgen medication.
[3:37:56.000 --> 3:38:00.080]  Now, an androgen, an androgen is actually hormones
[3:38:00.080 --> 3:38:03.400]  known as estrogen and testosterone most commonly.
[3:38:03.400 --> 3:38:07.080]  But when it comes to the disease process of COVID-19
[3:38:07.080 --> 3:38:11.160]  and all cancers, the most problematic hormone
[3:38:11.160 --> 3:38:14.280]  that's an androgen hormone is estrogen.
[3:38:14.280 --> 3:38:17.680]  And they're using anti-androgen hormones that cost five bucks.
[3:38:17.680 --> 3:38:19.040]  It actually, in just a couple of days,
[3:38:19.040 --> 3:38:21.680]  it's people to go home from hospitals with COVID-19.
[3:38:21.680 --> 3:38:24.440]  Do you know what's amazing, Kate?
[3:38:24.440 --> 3:38:27.960]  They have a drug that they inject called anti-androgens.
[3:38:27.960 --> 3:38:30.760]  But do you know what mineral supplement
[3:38:30.760 --> 3:38:37.260]  is also a very effective anti-androgen hormone supplement?
[3:38:37.260 --> 3:38:38.880]  Tell me.
[3:38:38.880 --> 3:38:41.400]  It's zinc.
[3:38:41.400 --> 3:38:47.040]  In fact, zinc deficiency is the number one
[3:38:47.040 --> 3:38:50.080]  cause for estrogen dominance in all human beings.
[3:38:50.080 --> 3:38:51.280]  Zinc deficiency.
[3:38:51.280 --> 3:38:56.000]  Zinc is also the only mineral inside of cells
[3:38:56.000 --> 3:38:59.440]  that stops all viruses, including coronaviruses,
[3:38:59.440 --> 3:39:01.560]  from replicating.
[3:39:01.560 --> 3:39:04.760]  So zinc is not only effective against the COVID-19 virus
[3:39:04.760 --> 3:39:06.960]  or any of its variants, the flu virus, you name it.
[3:39:06.960 --> 3:39:09.080]  Everyone needs to be supplementing zinc.
[3:39:09.080 --> 3:39:12.280]  I suggest 50 milligrams to 100 every day.
[3:39:12.280 --> 3:39:15.840]  But its anti-androgen hormone balancing effect
[3:39:15.840 --> 3:39:19.720]  for estrogen and testosterone is hugely beneficial
[3:39:19.720 --> 3:39:23.600]  in the immune processes to beat COVID-19.
[3:39:23.600 --> 3:39:24.520]  Right.
[3:39:24.520 --> 3:39:26.560]  Chase, you know what this is like?
[3:39:26.560 --> 3:39:29.440]  This reminds me of somebody having a hang nail.
[3:39:29.440 --> 3:39:32.520]  And they want to treat it with AZT.
[3:39:32.520 --> 3:39:35.600]  And they want to treat it with chopping up the arm.
[3:39:35.600 --> 3:39:38.080]  And they come up with all these concoctions.
[3:39:38.080 --> 3:39:40.520]  And what you're saying is, this is so simple.
[3:39:40.520 --> 3:39:41.760]  This is so easy.
[3:39:41.760 --> 3:39:43.560]  You don't even need to go to a hospital.
[3:39:43.560 --> 3:39:45.600]  You can actually treat this at home
[3:39:45.600 --> 3:39:48.840]  if you just have some things on hand and know what to do.
[3:39:48.840 --> 3:39:52.680]  And for some reason, they have instilled the fear of God
[3:39:52.680 --> 3:39:54.800]  into everybody that they're going to die,
[3:39:54.800 --> 3:39:57.200]  that they're going to die and they all have COVID.
[3:39:57.200 --> 3:39:59.560]  It's truly amazing what fear can do.
[3:40:01.200 --> 3:40:02.040]  It is very true.
[3:40:02.040 --> 3:40:04.280]  And I just want everybody to know on this show,
[3:40:04.280 --> 3:40:06.880]  monoclonal antibodies don't show up anywhere higher
[3:40:06.880 --> 3:40:10.640]  than COVID-19 on that list for beating COVID-19.
[3:40:10.640 --> 3:40:11.720]  Isn't that interesting?
[3:40:11.720 --> 3:40:15.280]  But you don't see them promoting COVID-19 clinics
[3:40:15.280 --> 3:40:17.480]  and treatment centers around the country.
[3:40:17.480 --> 3:40:19.360]  It's too cheap. You can go get COVID-19
[3:40:19.360 --> 3:40:23.360]  at any CVS Walgreens in the country for less than $5.
[3:40:25.120 --> 3:40:27.080]  It's totally amazing to me.
[3:40:27.080 --> 3:40:28.280]  It's very cheap to do.
[3:40:28.280 --> 3:40:29.400]  You can do it at home.
[3:40:29.400 --> 3:40:31.280]  Just have the right things on hand.
[3:40:31.280 --> 3:40:32.760]  Anyone can do this.
[3:40:32.760 --> 3:40:34.120]  We have to spread the word
[3:40:34.120 --> 3:40:37.120]  because they are really pushing monoclonal antibodies.
[3:40:37.120 --> 3:40:39.160]  They're having the military in my city
[3:40:39.160 --> 3:40:41.480]  administer it to people as their prop in a base
[3:40:41.480 --> 3:40:45.880]  as if we need this in some sort of emergency situation.
[3:40:45.880 --> 3:40:48.040]  And people are walking around just fine.
[3:40:48.040 --> 3:40:49.160]  So what are they gonna do?
[3:40:49.160 --> 3:40:50.960]  They're gonna inject this stuff in their system
[3:40:50.960 --> 3:40:52.240]  and they're gonna walk away thinking,
[3:40:52.240 --> 3:40:53.760]  oh, see, I'm good. I'm good.
[3:40:53.760 --> 3:40:55.880]  When COVID hits me, I'll be all right.
[3:40:55.880 --> 3:40:57.880]  The problem is is that it's hurting
[3:40:57.880 --> 3:41:00.920]  their immune system long-term and they don't know it.
[3:41:01.800 --> 3:41:03.440]  Not just the immune system, Kate.
[3:41:03.440 --> 3:41:06.240]  There's two studies I was just looking at earlier today.
[3:41:06.240 --> 3:41:09.800]  The antibodies that attack spike proteins
[3:41:09.800 --> 3:41:12.000]  of a SARS-CoV-2 virus.
[3:41:12.000 --> 3:41:15.160]  That's what monoclonal antibodies are.
[3:41:15.160 --> 3:41:16.800]  They actually are shown and proven
[3:41:16.800 --> 3:41:21.360]  to damage the cells inside of the uterus during a pregnancy
[3:41:21.360 --> 3:41:26.360]  to lead to abortions, miscarriages, infertility, birth defects.
[3:41:26.720 --> 3:41:28.440]  There's a huge issue with this,
[3:41:28.440 --> 3:41:31.880]  not just with illness, an immune system.
[3:41:31.880 --> 3:41:33.840]  That's actually damaging diseases,
[3:41:33.840 --> 3:41:35.240]  even including those organs
[3:41:35.240 --> 3:41:37.880]  that are responsible for healthy fertility.
[3:41:37.880 --> 3:41:40.040]  So any female, young female,
[3:41:40.040 --> 3:41:41.040]  it would be super concerned
[3:41:41.040 --> 3:41:44.480]  to have monoclonal antibodies introduced into their body.
[3:41:44.480 --> 3:41:46.400]  It's just as a huge threat long-term
[3:41:46.400 --> 3:41:47.320]  and I would try to avoid it.
[3:41:47.320 --> 3:41:50.200]  Remember, 28 tissues in the human body
[3:41:50.200 --> 3:41:53.640]  are damaged just like the spike proteins
[3:41:53.640 --> 3:41:55.520]  for the Salk Institute.
[3:41:55.520 --> 3:41:58.800]  Monoclonal antibodies that attack spike proteins
[3:41:58.800 --> 3:42:00.760]  and look for those are known to cause
[3:42:00.760 --> 3:42:04.040]  the exact array of diseases throughout the entire human body
[3:42:04.040 --> 3:42:06.520]  over time as do spike proteins.
[3:42:07.800 --> 3:42:10.880]  Yeah, and by the way, they call this antibodies
[3:42:10.880 --> 3:42:13.480]  so that you think you're getting some terrific product.
[3:42:13.480 --> 3:42:15.600]  It's kind of like every bill they name
[3:42:15.600 --> 3:42:19.840]  is named Apple Pie America, We Love You Bill or Act.
[3:42:19.840 --> 3:42:23.360]  It's all sold on the exact opposite premise.
[3:42:23.360 --> 3:42:24.920]  This is so disgusting to me
[3:42:24.920 --> 3:42:26.480]  that they keep shoving these things at us,
[3:42:26.480 --> 3:42:28.240]  but the hospitals are paid big bucks.
[3:42:28.240 --> 3:42:31.440]  And when they administer these in the hospital,
[3:42:31.440 --> 3:42:33.200]  they're given $13,000.
[3:42:33.200 --> 3:42:34.440]  Well, that's an easy paycheck
[3:42:34.440 --> 3:42:36.680]  coming out of our tax dollars, right?
[3:42:36.680 --> 3:42:39.400]  In that circular motion all the way around to the hospital.
[3:42:39.400 --> 3:42:40.560]  So we'll be right back.
[3:42:40.560 --> 3:42:42.360]  I'll be right back with Dr. Brian Artis.
[3:42:42.360 --> 3:42:43.480]  Isn't he amazing?
[3:42:43.480 --> 3:42:46.160]  And of course, Alex's show is off the hook today.
[3:42:46.160 --> 3:42:47.000]  Great.
[3:42:47.000 --> 3:42:48.720]  And I hope that all of us are learning
[3:42:48.720 --> 3:42:50.640]  about these antibodies.
[3:42:50.640 --> 3:42:51.680]  Oh, stay away.
[3:42:55.840 --> 3:42:58.440]  I'm cutting this brief announcement
[3:42:58.440 --> 3:43:02.440]  on the afternoon of November 9th, 2021.

[3:46:54.000 --> 3:46:55.200]  at infowarstore.com.
[3:46:55.200 --> 3:46:58.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:47:08.200 --> 3:47:11.200]  Back here with you, I'm Kate Daly from the Kate Daly Show,
[3:47:11.200 --> 3:47:14.200]  KateDalyRadio.com, trying to bring you all these topics
[3:47:14.200 --> 3:47:16.200]  so that we can get a great understanding
[3:47:16.200 --> 3:47:17.200]  of the things we need.
[3:47:17.200 --> 3:47:19.200]  I have Dr. Brian Ardis on with me
[3:47:19.200 --> 3:47:22.200]  and he is just a rock star frontline doctor
[3:47:22.200 --> 3:47:26.200]  who is absolutely trying to warn everybody
[3:47:26.200 --> 3:47:27.200]  what you can do.
[3:47:27.200 --> 3:47:31.200]  In fact, we were talking earlier about Medicare patients
[3:47:31.200 --> 3:47:34.200]  dying at kind of an alarming rate on these treatments
[3:47:34.200 --> 3:47:36.200]  and I just wanted you to say,
[3:47:36.200 --> 3:47:39.200]  just talk about that for just a moment, Dr. Brian Ardis
[3:47:39.200 --> 3:47:41.200]  because people really need to understand this.
[3:47:41.200 --> 3:47:44.200]  By the way, his website is thedrartishow.com
[3:47:44.200 --> 3:47:46.200]  and you can get help if you're in a hospital
[3:47:46.200 --> 3:47:49.200]  and you don't know what to say to the doctors.
[3:47:49.200 --> 3:47:52.200]  You have all kinds of questions.
[3:47:52.200 --> 3:47:54.200]  Make sure and put your email in there
[3:47:54.200 --> 3:47:57.200]  and then that will unlock all those emails you'll get
[3:47:57.200 --> 3:48:00.200]  as far as this dire information that we all need to know.
[3:48:00.200 --> 3:48:02.200]  But welcome back, Dr. Brian Ardis.
[3:48:02.200 --> 3:48:03.200]  Thank you, Kate.
[3:48:03.200 --> 3:48:05.200]  You're a rock star too.
[3:48:05.200 --> 3:48:07.200]  Great job spreading truth
[3:48:07.200 --> 3:48:09.200]  and even saving your own husband
[3:48:09.200 --> 3:48:12.200]  from the horrible murderous protocol in hospitals.
[3:48:12.200 --> 3:48:14.200]  I'm very proud of you.
[3:48:14.200 --> 3:48:16.200]  Now, as far as the Dr. Ardis,
[3:48:16.200 --> 3:48:19.200]  as far as thedrartishow.com,
[3:48:19.200 --> 3:48:21.200]  this is just a very important resource
[3:48:21.200 --> 3:48:23.200]  I think everybody should have right now.
[3:48:23.200 --> 3:48:25.200]  Hospitals, as you've experienced,
[3:48:25.200 --> 3:48:27.200]  are really operating more like prisons
[3:48:27.200 --> 3:48:29.200]  than they are hospitals or care centers.
[3:48:29.200 --> 3:48:33.200]  And there are two forms on my Dr. Ardis show website.
[3:48:33.200 --> 3:48:36.200]  There is a medical directive for physicians.
[3:48:36.200 --> 3:48:38.200]  So this is an advanced directive
[3:48:38.200 --> 3:48:40.200]  you want to take with you a form
[3:48:40.200 --> 3:48:42.200]  that you want to have signed and notarized
[3:48:42.200 --> 3:48:44.200]  before you take yourself
[3:48:44.200 --> 3:48:46.200]  or a loved one to a hospital.
[3:48:46.200 --> 3:48:48.200]  It actually tells them there's five things
[3:48:48.200 --> 3:48:50.200]  you will not do to me
[3:48:50.200 --> 3:48:52.200]  if you determine I'm a COVID-19 patient.
[3:48:52.200 --> 3:48:54.200]  You will not use remdesivir.
[3:48:54.200 --> 3:48:57.200]  You will not vent to me under any premise
[3:48:57.200 --> 3:48:59.200]  or any reasoning or under any condition.
[3:48:59.200 --> 3:49:01.200]  I do not consent.
[3:49:01.200 --> 3:49:03.200]  I don't know if you know this, Kate,
[3:49:03.200 --> 3:49:04.200]  but in hospitals right now,
[3:49:04.200 --> 3:49:06.200]  there's some of them around the country
[3:49:06.200 --> 3:49:09.200]  that are having disclaimers built into their admissions forms
[3:49:09.200 --> 3:49:11.200]  that you don't read.
[3:49:11.200 --> 3:49:13.200]  And people who do not read them,
[3:49:13.200 --> 3:49:15.200]  they don't sign the form.
[3:49:15.200 --> 3:49:17.200]  It says by signing this form,
[3:49:17.200 --> 3:49:19.200]  you can send to the hospital
[3:49:19.200 --> 3:49:21.200]  giving you the COVID-19 vaccine.
[3:49:21.200 --> 3:49:23.200]  Now, there's also on that directive form.
[3:49:23.200 --> 3:49:25.200]  On our directive form,
[3:49:25.200 --> 3:49:27.200]  the fourth bullet point is I don't consent.
[3:49:27.200 --> 3:49:29.200]  If you had banned to this hospital
[3:49:29.200 --> 3:49:31.200]  or moved me to a psychiatric facility,
[3:49:31.200 --> 3:49:34.200]  I never consent to the COVID-19 shots.
[3:49:34.200 --> 3:49:36.200]  You have to have some of these things in place,
[3:49:36.200 --> 3:49:38.200]  along with the medical power of attorney form.
[3:49:38.200 --> 3:49:41.200]  You find that at our site by setting up an account
[3:49:41.200 --> 3:49:43.200]  username and password and log back in,
[3:49:43.200 --> 3:49:45.200]  the resources page appears,
[3:49:45.200 --> 3:49:47.200]  and that's where you find the forms at the bottom
[3:49:47.200 --> 3:49:49.200]  or anybody needs to go to a hospital.
[3:49:49.200 --> 3:49:51.200]  The remdesivir stuff you asked about.
[3:49:51.200 --> 3:49:52.200]  I don't know if you know this,
[3:49:52.200 --> 3:49:54.200]  but Medicare and Medicaid services
[3:49:54.200 --> 3:49:56.200]  are bribing all hospitals in the country
[3:49:56.200 --> 3:49:58.200]  with a 20% bonus payout
[3:49:58.200 --> 3:50:01.200]  if that hospital or doctor's facility
[3:50:01.200 --> 3:50:05.200]  will treat 65-year and older Medicare patients in America
[3:50:05.200 --> 3:50:08.200]  with remdesivir versus any other treatment.
[3:50:08.200 --> 3:50:10.200]  So they're being incentivized to use,
[3:50:10.200 --> 3:50:13.200]  like we showed you on that website audience,
[3:50:13.200 --> 3:50:17.200]  we showed you that remdesivir only has a 19% success rate
[3:50:17.200 --> 3:50:20.200]  or survivability rate with COVID-19,
[3:50:20.200 --> 3:50:23.200]  but Medicare is bribing hospitals to use it
[3:50:23.200 --> 3:50:25.200]  and paying them 20% more.
[3:50:25.200 --> 3:50:27.200]  This should make you furious.
[3:50:27.200 --> 3:50:29.200]  It makes me furious.
[3:50:29.200 --> 3:50:33.200]  And I cannot wait to help you guys understand
[3:50:33.200 --> 3:50:36.200]  their options you have to protect you and your loved ones
[3:50:36.200 --> 3:50:37.200]  in hospitals.
[3:50:37.200 --> 3:50:40.200]  You need that advanced directive form on our site
[3:50:40.200 --> 3:50:43.200]  written up by attorneys and the medical power of attorney form.
[3:50:43.200 --> 3:50:46.200]  Remdesivir right now, the statistics are
[3:50:46.200 --> 3:50:48.200]  any of my 65 years and older,
[3:50:48.200 --> 3:50:50.200]  including in the state of New York,
[3:50:50.200 --> 3:50:52.200]  we've done the entire state CMS's data review.
[3:50:52.200 --> 3:50:57.200]  It's 26.9% of every Medicare-aged patient in New York
[3:50:57.200 --> 3:51:00.200]  who went through the five-day treatment with remdesivir.
[3:51:00.200 --> 3:51:02.200]  They died.
[3:51:02.200 --> 3:51:04.200]  That's 26.9% pay.
[3:51:04.200 --> 3:51:07.200]  COVID kills less than 1% of the entire world
[3:51:07.200 --> 3:51:09.200]  that's gotten this infection.
[3:51:09.200 --> 3:51:12.200]  Why would you choose any drug that has a higher mortality
[3:51:12.200 --> 3:51:14.200]  than 1% of rate?
[3:51:14.200 --> 3:51:16.200]  I don't know.
[3:51:16.200 --> 3:51:18.200]  I don't know anymore what is going through people's minds,
[3:51:18.200 --> 3:51:21.200]  but I want you to tell people too,
[3:51:21.200 --> 3:51:23.200]  anyone that's sitting at home that says,
[3:51:23.200 --> 3:51:25.200]  I'm just not quite sure what to get.
[3:51:25.200 --> 3:51:27.200]  What are the five most important things I should have
[3:51:27.200 --> 3:51:29.200]  in my house right now that would prepare me
[3:51:29.200 --> 3:51:32.200]  so that I don't even have to use a directive
[3:51:32.200 --> 3:51:33.200]  or go to the hospital?
[3:51:33.200 --> 3:51:35.200]  What would you tell people to do?
[3:51:35.200 --> 3:51:37.200]  What would you tell them to get?
[3:51:37.200 --> 3:51:38.200]  Great question, Kate.
[3:51:38.200 --> 3:51:39.200]  All right.
[3:51:39.200 --> 3:51:41.200]  So for those of you who want to have medications at home,
[3:51:41.200 --> 3:51:44.200]  there's two main ones everybody should have.
[3:51:44.200 --> 3:51:46.200]  It's going to be BUDesinide Respules
[3:51:46.200 --> 3:51:48.200]  and make sure you have a nebulizer.
[3:51:48.200 --> 3:51:51.200]  You can get BUDesinide through prescription
[3:51:51.200 --> 3:51:53.200]  or through compound pharmacies.
[3:51:53.200 --> 3:51:57.200]  Go to synergyhelpdpc.com.
[3:51:57.200 --> 3:52:00.200]  They can help you get these via telemedicine
[3:52:00.200 --> 3:52:02.200]  and they actually direct ship from compound pharmacies.
[3:52:02.200 --> 3:52:04.200]  Udesinide and ivermectin,
[3:52:04.200 --> 3:52:06.200]  they can both help you with those medications
[3:52:06.200 --> 3:52:07.200]  to have those at home.
[3:52:07.200 --> 3:52:10.200]  I do not recommend using it until you have any symptoms of any kind.
[3:52:10.200 --> 3:52:11.200]  Those are the medications.
[3:52:11.200 --> 3:52:14.200]  Outside of the medications, everyone should be taken Z,
[3:52:14.200 --> 3:52:17.200]  like we mentioned earlier, 50 milligrams to 100 milligrams
[3:52:17.200 --> 3:52:20.200]  every day I recommend and I do take every day
[3:52:20.200 --> 3:52:22.200]  and so does my wife.
[3:52:22.200 --> 3:52:27.200]  Second would be vitamin C at 5,000 milligrams every day
[3:52:27.200 --> 3:52:29.200]  for the rest of your life.
[3:52:29.200 --> 3:52:33.200]  Selenium at 200 micrograms.
[3:52:33.200 --> 3:52:35.200]  This is a very cheap supplement, go get it.
[3:52:35.200 --> 3:52:39.200]  Selenium tells your bone marrow to make more white blood cells
[3:52:39.200 --> 3:52:41.200]  that's your natural immunity
[3:52:41.200 --> 3:52:43.200]  that helps to protect you against all viruses,
[3:52:43.200 --> 3:52:47.200]  including those that man-made like SARS-CoV-2.
[3:52:47.200 --> 3:52:50.200]  Selenium helps also make your liver produce glutathione
[3:52:50.200 --> 3:52:53.200]  that protects every cell on the outside of inside your body
[3:52:53.200 --> 3:52:57.200]  from damages from spike proteins, viruses, poisons,
[3:52:57.200 --> 3:52:59.200]  even ionized radiation.
[3:52:59.200 --> 3:53:04.200]  So I recommend those and I also recommend vitamin D, 5,000 IUs.
[3:53:04.200 --> 3:53:06.200]  We're moving into the winter time
[3:53:06.200 --> 3:53:08.200]  and sunlight will be less and less
[3:53:08.200 --> 3:53:11.200]  for the majority of those living above, you know,
[3:53:11.200 --> 3:53:13.200]  the midline of the United States.
[3:53:13.200 --> 3:53:14.200]  We should all be taking vitamin D.
[3:53:14.200 --> 3:53:18.200]  So those are the things I would recommend you have on hand, all of you.
[3:53:18.200 --> 3:53:21.200]  But you know, it's interesting that we're always sold on the fact
[3:53:21.200 --> 3:53:22.200]  that oh no, take minimal.
[3:53:22.200 --> 3:53:23.200]  Oh no, that's too much.
[3:53:23.200 --> 3:53:24.200]  That's scary.
[3:53:24.200 --> 3:53:25.200]  That might hurt you.
[3:53:25.200 --> 3:53:28.200]  But you know what, high doses of these things do not hurt.
[3:53:28.200 --> 3:53:33.200]  In fact, in the 1940s, the amount they were giving a vitamin C
[3:53:33.200 --> 3:53:37.200]  for patients with pneumonia to get it gone and quick
[3:53:37.200 --> 3:53:40.200]  was 15,000 to 20,000 a day.
[3:53:40.200 --> 3:53:42.200]  So when you're saying take even 5,000,
[3:53:42.200 --> 3:53:44.200]  you know, when you're healthy but you want to maintain,
[3:53:44.200 --> 3:53:46.200]  take 10,000, maybe when you're sick.
[3:53:46.200 --> 3:53:48.200]  This is what we did for my husband in the hospital.
[3:53:48.200 --> 3:53:51.200]  So that's not that much, but we've been trained.
[3:53:51.200 --> 3:53:53.200]  The doctors tell you, oh no, you don't need those.
[3:53:53.200 --> 3:53:55.200]  We're all depleted, right?
[3:53:55.200 --> 3:53:56.200]  Oh yes.
[3:53:56.200 --> 3:53:58.200]  And you should know, and your audience should know,
[3:53:58.200 --> 3:54:02.200]  in January of 2020, do you remember the Wuhan lab had those few people
[3:54:02.200 --> 3:54:05.200]  that got sick in China with COVID-19 pneumonia?
[3:54:05.200 --> 3:54:09.200]  In January of 2020, the Chinese government already figured out
[3:54:09.200 --> 3:54:13.200]  that in hospitals, if they just simply injected their Chinese citizens
[3:54:13.200 --> 3:54:19.200]  that were sick with 25 grams of vitamin C a day,
[3:54:19.200 --> 3:54:23.200]  they all 100% of them beat the pneumonia,
[3:54:23.200 --> 3:54:26.200]  and we're all home by day five, 100% of all of them.
[3:54:26.200 --> 3:54:28.200]  That's 25 grams.
[3:54:28.200 --> 3:54:30.200]  That's 25,000 milligrams.
[3:54:30.200 --> 3:54:34.200]  Now, if that's safe to inject directly into your veins,
[3:54:34.200 --> 3:54:36.200]  okay, you and I are correct,
[3:54:36.200 --> 3:54:40.200]  5,000 to 10,000 milligrams of vitamin C every day orally,
[3:54:40.200 --> 3:54:43.200]  totally safe, totally warranted,
[3:54:43.200 --> 3:54:47.200]  and I would not trust the FDA's recommendations on nutrition ever.
[3:54:47.200 --> 3:54:49.200]  If you guys haven't doubted them yet,
[3:54:49.200 --> 3:54:53.200]  this FDA group, the Food and Drug Administration,
[3:54:53.200 --> 3:54:57.200]  that tells all of us Americans how much vitamin C we should eat a day,
[3:54:57.200 --> 3:54:59.200]  how much zinc every day we should take,
[3:54:59.200 --> 3:55:01.200]  how many selenium and magnesium,
[3:55:01.200 --> 3:55:05.200]  this same organization who tells you how much minerals and vitamins you should eat,
[3:55:05.200 --> 3:55:08.200]  or it's dangerous if you take more than that,
[3:55:08.200 --> 3:55:11.200]  is the same organization Kate who just said,
[3:55:11.200 --> 3:55:17.200]  we don't care that the CDC shows a five and a 20 times more incidence
[3:55:17.200 --> 3:55:22.200]  of heart disease from the Pfizer shot in teenagers, teenage girls and boys.
[3:55:22.200 --> 3:55:24.200]  We don't care about that.
[3:55:24.200 --> 3:55:28.200]  We're going to go ahead and inject all five to 11-year-old children in this country,
[3:55:28.200 --> 3:55:32.200]  28 million of them with these experimental deadly shots.
[3:55:32.200 --> 3:55:35.200]  I wouldn't trust anything the FDA tells you.
[3:55:35.200 --> 3:55:37.200]  Yeah, I wouldn't either, actually.
[3:55:37.200 --> 3:55:39.200]  I'm really glad you told the audience that.
[3:55:39.200 --> 3:55:42.200]  I don't want to hear that from you because people need to hear it again and again
[3:55:42.200 --> 3:55:47.200]  to combat the mainstream media horrors that dispel bad information every day.
[3:55:47.200 --> 3:55:49.200]  And also, since the 1970s,
[3:55:49.200 --> 3:55:54.200]  the food pyramid even gave us the monstrosities that we are today in obesity.
[3:55:54.200 --> 3:55:56.200]  We're a fat nation.
[3:55:56.200 --> 3:56:00.200]  We were not that fat nation in 1970, but we started listening to them.
[3:56:00.200 --> 3:56:02.200]  So that's why I don't give them much credence.
[3:56:02.200 --> 3:56:04.200]  I don't know why people do.
[3:56:04.200 --> 3:56:08.200]  It's kind of like waiting for truth to come out of the mainstream media before you believe it.
[3:56:08.200 --> 3:56:10.200]  They're not going to tell the truth.
[3:56:10.200 --> 3:56:12.200]  And these people are not going to tell the truth.
[3:56:12.200 --> 3:56:15.200]  It's a money incentive program, pay for play.
[3:56:15.200 --> 3:56:19.200]  And so in this last minute and a half, what do you want people to know?
[3:56:19.200 --> 3:56:24.200]  They're getting told every day in the news that monoclonal antibodies that just came out
[3:56:24.200 --> 3:56:26.200]  are the most amazing thing they'll ever take.
[3:56:26.200 --> 3:56:30.200]  Oh, please, people do not believe this for a hot second.
[3:56:30.200 --> 3:56:34.200]  What do you want your takeaway to be in this last minute?
[3:56:34.200 --> 3:56:36.200]  This is what I really want everybody to know.
[3:56:36.200 --> 3:56:42.200]  We live in a country, you and I do, Kate, who actually pronounces or proclaims themselves to be Pentecostals,
[3:56:42.200 --> 3:56:48.200]  believers in God, and he created these amazing bodies and saved this amazing creation
[3:56:48.200 --> 3:56:52.200]  for the last day of his creative period, day six.
[3:56:52.200 --> 3:56:56.200]  He created a perfect body with an immune system in it, I believe,
[3:56:56.200 --> 3:57:02.200]  that is far superior to any artificial immunity man can come up with in a lab.
[3:57:02.200 --> 3:57:07.200]  In fact, right now, if any of you go to brownstone.org,
[3:57:07.200 --> 3:57:17.200]  brownstone.org, Paul Elias Alexander PhD has a list compiled 110,
[3:57:17.200 --> 3:57:26.200]  their actual research peer reviewed studies, 110 studies proving natural immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection
[3:57:26.200 --> 3:57:33.200]  is far superior in long lasting to any COVID-19 vaccine immunity.
[3:57:33.200 --> 3:57:38.200]  I don't know how many studies have done this in 110.
[3:57:38.200 --> 3:57:45.200]  Thank you. Dr. Brian Artis, the DrArtistShow.com, and I'm Kate Daly from the Kate Daly Show.com.
[3:57:45.200 --> 3:57:51.200]  After being unavailable for more than two years, Ultimate Bone Broth is back at InfoWarsLife.
[3:57:51.200 --> 3:57:56.200]  Ultimate Bone Broth is now Ultimate Bone Broth Plus because we've made it even stronger
[3:57:56.200 --> 3:58:01.200]  and reformulated it. And listen, it's not just concentrated chicken broth in there
[3:58:01.200 --> 3:58:04.200]  that's so good for your joints, your bones, and your whole body.
[3:58:04.200 --> 3:58:09.200]  It's got really strong high-end turmeric root, chaga mushroom,
[3:58:09.200 --> 3:58:14.200]  bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder, and a bunch of other stuff in it,
[3:58:14.200 --> 3:58:19.200]  like real organic cocoa, bean powder, natural chocolate flavor, and a touch of sea salt,
[3:58:19.200 --> 3:58:23.200]  and just on and on and on, magnesium, potassium's added.
[3:58:23.200 --> 3:58:27.200]  This is so good for inflammation, for your immune system, for your whole body.
[3:58:27.200 --> 3:58:30.200]  Grandma always gave you chicken soup when you were sick, remember?
[3:58:30.200 --> 3:58:36.200]  That's a tiny amount of the same stuff that's in there that is now in here in a very large amount.
[3:58:36.200 --> 3:58:41.200]  So again, get the power of Grandma's chicken soup with the power of turmeric and everything else
[3:58:41.200 --> 3:58:45.200]  with the new and improved Bone Broth at InfoWarsStore.com.
[3:58:45.200 --> 3:58:51.200]  If a hurricane is smashing into the Gulf Coast and I make the prediction
[3:58:51.200 --> 3:58:54.200]  that it's going to cause flooding, that's not a prediction.
[3:58:54.200 --> 3:58:57.200]  You know it's a hurricane, you know it's got a lot of water, it's going to die,
[3:58:57.200 --> 3:59:00.200]  it's going to cause flooding. So it wasn't a prediction 20 months ago
[3:59:00.200 --> 3:59:05.200]  when I said the UN order to lock down the world economy is going to cause a chain reaction
[3:59:05.200 --> 3:59:08.200]  that's going to cause supply chain problems for years,
[3:59:08.200 --> 3:59:11.200]  that's going to starve tens of millions to death. And now it all happened.
[3:59:11.200 --> 3:59:14.200]  25 million extra dead, hundreds of millions on the verge of starvation,
[3:59:14.200 --> 3:59:17.200]  and the UN that ordered it's running around being the savior.
[3:59:17.200 --> 3:59:20.200]  Listen, when the first world collapses, the third world dies,
[3:59:20.200 --> 3:59:22.200]  and now the first world's becoming the third world.
[3:59:22.200 --> 3:59:25.200]  So listen to me now, we've got the highest quality storable foods,
[3:59:25.200 --> 3:59:30.200]  the lowest price you're going to find, ready to ship to you right now at 10% off until November 15th.
[3:59:30.200 --> 3:59:35.200]  But after that, the prices are going up, we cannot suppress prices anymore.
