[01:44.720 --> 01:51.440]  is perfect timing that I had him set up because of his article last week he wrote it is getting
[01:51.440 --> 01:58.320]  very serious now at ChuckBaldwin.com where he breaks down not just the MIAC report the DHS
[01:58.320 --> 02:02.480]  report saying veterans and gun owners are the main threat and that Homeland Security is set up to
[02:02.480 --> 02:09.840]  deal with the American people but that a new bill has been introduced saying that extremists will
[02:09.840 --> 02:14.880]  be put on a no-gun list and there will be no arrest no indictment you'll have no way to know why
[02:14.880 --> 02:21.280]  you're on the list just no more second amendment at the will of the president the justice department
[02:21.280 --> 02:27.840]  or any of their designates this is the complete end of freedom I mean even in Russia and communist

[02:40.480 --> 02:46.640]  arrested and gets tried and gets executed never knowing what his crime was I mean this is the
[02:46.640 --> 02:53.280]  heart there's a center of a black hole of tyranny it is secretly having your right strip secretly

[03:19.600 --> 03:30.160]  when I got home from the radio show I was staggered by it I was staggered by the legislation by the
[03:30.160 --> 03:41.840]  over the top in your face strength of it just the fact that it was so open and that is ladies

[04:28.320 --> 04:35.040]  over a million people and growing on that list well the new bill says the same thing
[04:37.040 --> 04:40.480]  and then there's that other bill they've got introduced with the attorney general can ban
[04:40.480 --> 04:47.760]  guns at will it's like oh we passed a law saying the attorney general's god you can't do that
[04:48.800 --> 04:53.680]  and we we passed a bill saying made off can kidnap little children and barbecue him on a
[04:53.680 --> 04:59.040]  spit if he wants and he can't do that and we passed a law that uh everybody has to worship

[08:21.040 --> 08:30.960]  jones there is not one there is not two there is three bills i know and there are tens of thousands
[08:30.960 --> 08:37.680]  of pieces of legislation getting introduced every session bills introduced by powerful members of
[08:37.680 --> 08:45.600]  the democratic party bills previously introduced by the white house chief of staff when he was the
[08:45.600 --> 08:51.920]  congressman from illinois rome manual he has written a book about it he has given speeches
[08:51.920 --> 08:58.560]  about it uh barack obama has given speeches and voted for total gun bans in illinois no guns total
[08:58.560 --> 09:05.120]  ban uh the attorney general put in briefings last year in the dc gun ban casing he believed
[09:05.760 --> 09:10.000]  no citizen should be allowed to own any gun anywhere in the united states and then you have
[09:10.000 --> 09:16.960]  record gun sales and the media runs news pieces every day that i see and i'm not watching television
[09:16.960 --> 09:22.080]  i'll be on msnbc and this morning looking at financial news and see a video clip in the corner
[09:22.080 --> 09:27.840]  you know making fun of gun owners buying guns and i clicked on it and there i mean it's everywhere
[09:27.840 --> 09:33.520]  oh look at these crazy people you know they think the government's coming after their guns when the
[09:33.520 --> 09:40.960]  this is the biggest group of anti-second amendment anti-self-defense anti-american trash i have ever
[09:40.960 --> 09:48.480]  seen in my life and the media is engaged in a massive hoax cover-up saying it doesn't exist
[09:50.720 --> 09:55.600]  meanwhile it's got to be more than 15 senators i mean every couple days i see a different
[09:55.600 --> 09:59.840]  senator in the news saying yeah we we need a new ferris doctor not just for radio and tv but for the
[09:59.840 --> 10:05.120]  internet and they've got the cyber bullying act separate from the hate crimes bill because hate
[10:05.120 --> 10:09.280]  crimes bills are the distraction because that restricts first amendment somewhat
[10:10.320 --> 10:15.840]  i mean this cyber bullying says i've given the bill number out the last two weeks 50 times i'll
[10:15.840 --> 10:19.360]  give it out again in fact guys we i already cleaned off my desk from last week but somebody
[10:19.360 --> 10:25.040]  print me the cyber bullying act again it actually says in there if someone signs an affidavit saying
[10:25.040 --> 10:30.320]  what you wrote or said hurts their feelings you are indicted federally under a felony of
[10:30.320 --> 10:36.560]  course that'll all be selectively enforced and you've got in states all over the country Missouri
[10:36.560 --> 10:45.280]  Illinois michigan vermont of all places police on the news saying if you criticize obama we're
[10:45.280 --> 10:53.840]  going to arrest you we you know we have mainstream newscast we play here all the time i'm not going
[10:53.840 --> 10:58.240]  to play it again if you don't believe me fine suck your thumb and just think it's made up the point is
[10:59.680 --> 11:02.960]  you know sit there in a straight jacket sucking your thumb in a mental institution
[11:02.960 --> 11:10.960]  we live in reality here and those of you telling us that we're crazy i keep getting emails every day
[11:10.960 --> 11:15.280]  and i see it all over youtube and google when i just happen to be surfing for videos and news
[11:15.280 --> 11:21.440]  and clips i'm being attacked saying i'm a liar the obama deception is a lie obama doesn't want our
[11:21.440 --> 11:31.360]  guns what planet are you people from you know it's like when we say we don't want the north american
[11:31.360 --> 11:35.520]  union and it's all over canadian british the president bush has press conferences admitting
[11:35.520 --> 11:40.560]  we're under the north american union and then news articles get written about myself and ludobs
[11:40.560 --> 11:47.520]  and others making fun of us saying it doesn't exist you know they would tell people that for 40 years
[11:47.520 --> 11:52.640]  in europe that the year that the euro didn't exist and now it's all declassified in public that they
[11:53.280 --> 12:01.760]  set it up in 1957 and there is a european union and by the way when i say that listeners i'm not
[12:01.760 --> 12:06.800]  joking for informed people there are actual folks out there that say the e u doesn't exist
[12:06.800 --> 12:12.560]  this is the level of denial that they're living in and so they've introduced
[12:12.560 --> 12:21.760]  a new bill another bill to restrict free speech we're going to get to later and
[12:23.120 --> 12:27.760]  i did some research this weekend on the michael savage situation on npr and a bunch of other
[12:27.760 --> 12:34.560]  mainline radio and they're on there and in in news articles defending michael savage band
[12:34.560 --> 12:39.600]  from traveling to europe for criticizing open borders and by the way it's not just england
[12:39.600 --> 12:46.240]  that's a eu regulation that the home secretary jackie smith's following and i shot there last
[12:46.240 --> 12:50.880]  not with my wife at like midnight she couldn't believe it watching i say watching is it's all
[12:50.880 --> 12:58.000]  up on youtube audio put the video of radio show after radio show national npr you name it saying
[12:58.000 --> 13:04.720]  yes ban his free speech it's good and then i heard savage on national npr with them defending
[13:04.720 --> 13:13.040]  him losing his free speech and then savage just hung up on him the interview and again
[13:13.040 --> 13:17.840]  i don't like michael savage in many respects on a lot of things he says redland is and prozac's
[13:17.840 --> 13:22.640]  making the kids go psychopathic and kill people you know i mean on about 80 percent of things it's
[13:23.200 --> 13:29.200]  carbon copy and i can't say he copied me or i copied him he's been on the air syndicated for
[13:29.200 --> 13:36.000]  10 years and so have i we've opened on the air 14 years so and so the issue is is we're on the same
[13:36.000 --> 13:40.800]  page on so many issues but i don't think leftists should be put in forced labor camps they disagree
[13:40.800 --> 13:47.600]  with war and i did and i criticized him then when he said that but now they're saying don't let him
[13:47.600 --> 13:54.720]  have free speech i'm criticizing them but to see the left in this country openly the majority of
[13:54.720 --> 14:00.800]  them saying get rid of free speech and these are high power democrats introducing the cyber bullying
[14:00.800 --> 14:13.360]  act well ladies and gentlemen in fact we need a drum roll for this drum roll please uh ladies and
[14:13.360 --> 14:27.920]  gentlemen i mean i've got a i've got to point out that this is serious and and not just throw it out

[14:46.720 --> 14:54.240]  carol mccarthy introduced the no fly no buy act hr 24 01 a bill that would merge the tsa's no fly
[14:54.240 --> 14:59.600]  list with the national insta criminal background check at point of sale system determining eligibility
[14:59.600 --> 15:02.880]  and remember you're not arrested you're not indicted you don't know where this came from
[15:03.520 --> 15:08.480]  and then now they're saying a no buy list and no sell list and no travel list this is the global
[15:08.480 --> 15:13.680]  system this is what europe already has this you know this thing with michael savage or or myself
[15:13.680 --> 15:18.800]  being arrested or david ike being arrested when we go to canada you know this whole thing of
[15:18.800 --> 15:23.120]  peace activists not being able to get on planes you know you've heard about green party people
[15:23.120 --> 15:29.040]  not being able to fly all of this is the global model and everybody keeps talking about the global

[15:33.040 --> 15:38.400]  under treaty that's why they're phasing out cash that's how they'll go to the new world currency
[15:38.400 --> 15:42.240]  instantly when they want to because that's why your kids are thumb scanning to get their school
[15:42.240 --> 15:49.840]  lunches all of this ties together this is the secret list and your id card says you're out of
[15:49.840 --> 15:57.280]  favor you don't travel you don't get a job it's all under patriot act compliance so we've got the bill
[15:57.280 --> 16:02.640]  that we wrote about info wars dot com a week and a half ago that uh... truck ball and wrote about
[16:02.640 --> 16:07.360]  last week in his article that's getting serious now that gave a nice boil down of a bigger picture
[16:07.360 --> 16:09.360]  picture
[16:09.360 --> 16:13.760]  and they've introduced hr two one five nine to nine firearms explosives to terrorist
[16:16.400 --> 16:21.680]  dangerous terrorist act and it says the same thing will secretly put anybody and everybody
[16:21.680 --> 16:26.560]  in intelligence files by the tens of millions and you're not going to have it's already happening
[16:27.120 --> 16:31.120]  veterans and others we already told you ten years ago that veterans were being barred from
[16:31.120 --> 16:38.880]  buying firearms with not even a misdemeanor conviction it's happening this isn't a game
[16:38.880 --> 16:45.520]  and then on top of that they've now released footage of the americors chanting and marching in red
[16:46.160 --> 16:52.000]  uniforms trimmed with black it is so fascist it's so over the top ladies and gentlemen
[16:52.000 --> 16:55.520]  everything is off the charts let's go to presidential candidate two thousand and eight
[16:55.520 --> 17:02.560]  chuck ball one pastor author researcher talk show host chuck bold when things are getting wild
[17:02.560 --> 17:07.920]  you you're right when you say it's getting very serious now absolutely i thank you very much
[17:07.920 --> 17:12.320]  i should let me come on your show uh... when i when i wrote that i felt that i had to get the
[17:12.320 --> 17:16.080]  message out to the people that are reading my columns to help them understand as you have
[17:16.080 --> 17:21.120]  been trying to do for all these years on how things really are getting serious out there
[17:21.120 --> 17:25.920]  here's the title of my column and i pointed out some of the very things that you just mentioned
[17:25.920 --> 17:33.120]  here at the opening of your program start breaking it down i mean you know there's three bills
[17:33.760 --> 17:38.560]  that will allow them without an indictment without a rest i mean that's the heart of tyranny
[17:38.560 --> 17:43.600]  three bills to just allow bureaucrats at will secretly to take your rights and you can't find
[17:43.600 --> 17:49.360]  out how you got on there or even challenge it right well the bill that i specifically
[17:49.360 --> 17:54.160]  mentioned in my column was uh... peter king's bill hr twenty one fifty nine
[17:54.160 --> 17:58.080]  the denying firearms explosives dangerous terrorist act of two thousand nine
[17:58.640 --> 18:06.640]  which basically permits the attorney general on his signature to deny transfer of a firearm
[18:06.640 --> 18:14.480]  to anyone that he deems to be quote a dangerous terrorist close quote now this is someone that
[18:14.480 --> 18:21.360]  is identified solely on the basis of of his opinion uh... there's no arrest
[18:21.360 --> 18:28.400]  there is no uh... act that that the person has committed uh... there's no charge
[18:29.040 --> 18:32.880]  uh... no sentence no trial no anything just that
[18:32.880 --> 18:36.880]  the attorney general says i believe this person is a dangerous terrorist therefore they are not
[18:36.880 --> 18:42.400]  able to buy a firearm or his designates this is divine right of case that's that's correct or
[18:42.400 --> 18:48.240]  his designates exactly right uh... so this is a as you say fascism i mean i you know people
[18:48.240 --> 18:52.880]  don't like to use that word but but the fact of matter is this is exactly the definition
[18:52.880 --> 19:00.880]  whenever you can arbitrarily without without warrant uh... without cause can deny basic
[19:00.880 --> 19:09.440]  rights to uh... the citizenry you have crossed the rubicon and now that you are in a a a country

[24:08.800 --> 24:14.320]  than i even thought they could get this quickly i mean we know the globalist are tyrannical but
[24:14.320 --> 24:21.200]  to see in the united states bills introduced to charge you with felonies federally if you
[24:21.200 --> 24:26.720]  quote hurt someone's feelings and to see it being introduced by prominent members of the house and
[24:26.720 --> 24:31.360]  racing to see three bills introduced where they can secretly ban your second amendment
[24:31.920 --> 24:35.920]  and you know chuck balvin last week interpreted this bill and said you know they could use the no
[24:35.920 --> 24:41.440]  fly list they could use the myac report list they could use each other list to and then now
[24:41.440 --> 24:50.160]  now with the new bill it confirms our worst fears they say yes yes in hr 24-01 if you're on any list
[24:50.160 --> 24:56.240]  or any database or anything or on the no fly list no second amendment pasture bald one you know
[24:56.240 --> 25:01.520]  people accuse us sometimes of being fear mongers no no we need people to raise the alarm we need
[25:01.520 --> 25:08.320]  people to stand up and warn the public or this is all gonna make it and then i i just can't believe
[25:08.320 --> 25:14.640]  we're having kind of like an amalgamation of a soviet slash nazi takeover i mean it's it i mean
[25:14.640 --> 25:19.840]  does it ever just stun you that this is happening alex i agree with your assessment that it's
[25:19.840 --> 25:25.680]  happening faster than we expected i i can tell you i'm in fact people that are listening right
[25:25.680 --> 25:30.480]  now that know me and have listened to me in my in my comments over the last few weeks i've said
[25:30.480 --> 25:36.480]  the exact same thing as you just said you know we anticipated some of these things to be happening
[25:36.480 --> 25:43.040]  over the next several months and maybe even a couple of years but we've seen things escalate at
[25:43.040 --> 25:48.880]  such a rate over these last few weeks that it's really difficult to keep up with it all i mean
[25:48.880 --> 25:52.960]  i i know that you are pouring over all this information as you see coming in every day
[25:52.960 --> 25:58.240]  three hours a day and it's hard for you to keep up with it as you just said and i find the same
[25:58.240 --> 26:07.680]  thing to be true it it's happening at such a a fast rate that it really is hard to get a handle on
[26:07.680 --> 26:13.040]  it and i think that the that the american people the ones that are beginning to wake up the ones
[26:13.040 --> 26:19.280]  that are beginning to sense that things are going in the wrong direction i believe it's kind of
[26:19.280 --> 26:25.280]  taking them back as well how quickly this is happening now the positive thing about it is
[26:25.280 --> 26:29.440]  alexa i do think because of of your show and many other people that are out there trying to
[26:29.440 --> 26:34.000]  sound the alarm what they call spearman is not so be it they probably said that about the committees
[26:34.000 --> 26:41.360]  of correspondence back in the 1700s this is reality and people are beginning to awaken to
[26:41.360 --> 26:47.760]  reality that's the positive thing and i think that the line is being drawn in the sand right now
[26:48.320 --> 26:52.400]  and i think that people are going to have to decide you know what what side of that line
[26:52.400 --> 26:57.200]  they're on either they believe in the constitution they believe in the rule of law they believe in
[26:57.200 --> 27:02.240]  the fundamental principles of the declaration of independence the bill of rights they believe on
[27:02.240 --> 27:07.840]  those principles that america was founded or they are going to willingly of their own volition
[27:07.840 --> 27:13.120]  surrendered to this new world order mindset and i do believe that line is being drawn in the sand
[27:13.120 --> 27:19.120]  and and i would just uh like to encourage your audience out there to uh to keep abreast of this
[27:19.120 --> 27:24.640]  and to recognize that what is happening is happening quickly and we need to be prepared
[27:24.640 --> 27:31.440]  for what is yet to come and make no mistake this is history and and and just as the enemy is
[27:31.440 --> 27:37.200]  moving quickly uh the the awakening is also accelerating and that also takes me back i mean
[27:37.200 --> 27:44.000]  it's exciting but when you study sociology and history and human activity it's a very explosive
[27:44.000 --> 27:50.400]  situation and you know i'm not some hot shot you're not a hot shot uh you know we're not looking for
[27:50.400 --> 27:56.240]  physical conflict but unfortunately i see in the cards of the tea leaves as they say that this is
[27:56.240 --> 28:02.160]  going towards a collision course uh so the i mean there's no doubt we've never seen an acceleration
[28:02.160 --> 28:07.760]  of of tyranny anywhere near this and it's clear the establishment has decided to jump they've
[28:07.760 --> 28:13.120]  decided to go total commitment and i just hope the patriots out there know this is it this is
[28:13.120 --> 28:17.840]  everything foretold everything we've been building for uh you know against the enemy everything
[28:17.840 --> 28:21.920]  they've been building against us all of our preparations all of our warnings it's clear
[28:21.920 --> 28:29.040]  we are entering i believe the battle zone uh chuck balvin yeah i agree and i think the battle zone
[28:29.040 --> 28:36.000]  right now is is with these some of these states of legislatures that are beginning to uh take a
[28:36.000 --> 28:40.880]  stand in their respective states i think we have what is it now between 25 and 30 you probably got
[28:40.880 --> 28:46.320]  a closer number on that of the states around the nation that have either passed or i have pending
[28:46.320 --> 28:51.200]  legislation that's 32 three states have passed it a bunch of governors are trying to block it yeah
[28:51.760 --> 28:57.920]  right that that that are you know taking a stand for state sovereignty that truly is exciting i
[28:57.920 --> 29:02.800]  mean whether or not all of these states truly understand all the legislators truly understand
[29:02.800 --> 29:07.440]  what's at stake here or whether or not they actually passed because of a governor's veto whatever
[29:07.440 --> 29:14.160]  uh all that notwithstanding it's still exciting in a sense that we have over now over half well
[29:14.160 --> 29:19.280]  over half of the state legislatures around the country that are at least awakened to the point
[29:19.280 --> 29:25.440]  that they recognize their tenth amendment prerogatives and that they as an independent
[29:25.440 --> 29:32.000]  autonomous free state have an obligation to stand and protect freedom in their states that is truly
[29:32.000 --> 29:36.800]  exciting dr balvin stay with us for five more minutes on the side i want to uh get your ideas
[29:36.800 --> 29:42.320]  on how we fight the anti-free speech legislation the anti-second amendment legislation and a lot more

[33:38.800 --> 33:43.200]  appreciate it taking time to join us and i want to open the phones up but specifically on the
[33:43.200 --> 33:52.080]  hate crimes act which gets all the attention that just makes thought crimes associated with
[33:52.080 --> 33:57.520]  real crime physical crime kick in so it's a big problem setting that precedent that's nothing
[33:57.520 --> 34:02.400]  compared to the cyber bullying act it says you don't have to punch somebody yell at them nothing
[34:02.400 --> 34:07.200]  you write or say something that somebody says hurts their feelings they sign an affidavit you
[34:07.200 --> 34:12.480]  are federally charged period and of course they'll selectively enforce that that's the cyber bullying
[34:12.480 --> 34:23.680]  act we've also got all these other bills hr2401 which puts you on a no fly list if you're in
[34:23.680 --> 34:29.360]  any of these databases or the government feels like putting you in there this is absolutely
[34:29.360 --> 34:37.280]  amazing bill in congress would ban gun ownership at will it's the no fly no buy act hr2401 and
[34:37.280 --> 34:44.240]  this is just the beginning the un the world health organization you know admits they're
[34:44.240 --> 34:48.880]  going to use the threat of pandemics to bring in global government that came out of boulderburg
[34:48.880 --> 34:54.720]  this weekend they're going to use global financial crises to bring in their new world order that's
[34:54.720 --> 35:00.320]  now being set up in front of everybody they are going to use global treaties which obama is trying
[35:00.320 --> 35:05.200]  to get the senate ratified restrict the second amendment heavily banning altering your firearms
[35:05.200 --> 35:11.600]  reloading is now an act of terrorism it actually says it but this one this ties in with michael
[35:11.600 --> 35:15.760]  savage not being allowed to go to england or europe that's an e u rule or the fact that i can't
[35:15.760 --> 35:21.200]  really go to canada i get arrested whenever i go there no charges no reason they just say you're
[35:21.200 --> 35:26.640]  an extremist this is the global system and and boy isn't isn't that pastor bulban right out of
[35:26.640 --> 35:30.720]  revelation i mean even if people don't believe in the christian faith or don't believe in god
[35:30.720 --> 35:36.160]  shouldn't they be opposed to a global tracking system where you face scan and thumbprint to buy
[35:36.160 --> 35:42.240]  and sell because that is what's being set up and these no fly list for gun owners that's just the
[35:42.240 --> 35:50.240]  beginning oh you you're starting to hit one of my hot buttons now alex you know absolutely any
[35:50.240 --> 35:54.720]  christian regardless of their eschatology and where they come down on the return of christ and of
[35:54.720 --> 35:59.280]  course there's many many varied opinions on that depending upon what point of view a particular
[35:59.280 --> 36:06.080]  believer has but the point is there is no doubt that believers throughout history have understood
[36:06.080 --> 36:12.320]  the basic elements of what is called the mark of the beast or the revival of an empire call whatever
[36:12.320 --> 36:16.960]  you want at the christians throughout history have understood the elements of that they've
[36:16.960 --> 36:24.240]  understood the the evil of it all and and the way that christians are set in opposition to it
[36:24.240 --> 36:30.880]  unfortunately what's happened over the last few years is that many of our christian brothers and
[36:30.880 --> 36:42.560]  sisters have used the return of christ and the various elements of of that doctrine as an excuse
[36:42.560 --> 36:50.000]  to literally sit on their blessed assurance and do nothing saying well this is all a part of prophecy
[36:50.000 --> 36:56.000]  and jesus is coming soon and there's nothing i can do about it and just the opposite of what
[36:56.000 --> 37:01.760]  our lord told us to do you know he told us that as believers we are to occupy until he comes
[37:02.320 --> 37:08.480]  uh occupation is a very hard hard work it's it's you know it's a very onerous task it's a very
[37:08.480 --> 37:14.320]  serious endeavor and we have an obligation to to oppose these things and to do what is right
[37:14.320 --> 37:20.640]  regardless of when christ comes and it could be today or it could be a hundred years from today
[37:20.640 --> 37:25.680]  pastor let's not i mean to interrupt let's look at the word occupy the god of this world is the
[37:25.680 --> 37:32.000]  old devil and so occupying uh you know makes a statement it's like an occupying army it means
[37:32.000 --> 37:37.760]  the world will be against us but we've got to occupy it that means run it well occupation is
[37:37.760 --> 37:42.560]  both a military term and a business term and in the greek it literally means to take care of business
[37:42.560 --> 37:48.720]  and we as believers have a task we have a business to take care of and we're supposed to take care
[37:48.720 --> 37:55.360]  of business up until the time that christ returns whenever that is and no man knows the day or the
[37:55.360 --> 38:00.720]  hour we anybody that says that they do they're lying to us they don't know when christ is coming
[38:00.720 --> 38:08.480]  until then we have a job to do well but what i see going on and one of my major uh consternations
[38:08.480 --> 38:16.400]  is is the way that christians use prophecy as an excuse for lethargy and apathy to sit back and do
[38:16.400 --> 38:24.000]  nothing to oppose the things that they know to be evil if if but if the believers in 1775 and
[38:24.000 --> 38:31.120]  76 and the pastor specifically would have acted the way that we are acting today in america we
[38:31.120 --> 38:34.880]  would still be a crown colony of great britain there would be no bill of rights there'd be no
[38:34.880 --> 38:39.360]  declaration of independence there'd be no u.s constitution there'd be no freedom that like
[38:39.360 --> 38:45.120]  we've enjoyed for these 200 plus years they stood up in the opposed tyranny they opposed the global
[38:45.120 --> 38:51.120]  order at that time they did what was right to do most of these men and women were christians the
[38:51.120 --> 38:57.840]  pastors were on the front lines fighting for our freedoms and and they prevailed but now what are
[38:57.840 --> 39:04.080]  we doing today we're sitting back and we're in the name of prophecy in the name of christianity
[39:04.080 --> 39:11.040]  we are allowing the evil one to to remove all of the fundamental freedoms that our forefathers
[39:11.040 --> 39:17.440]  fought and bled for it's inexcusable and we've got to get the preachers and the churches of america
[39:17.440 --> 39:25.840]  to awaken to what is happening and to set the in opposition that which is necessary well again i
[39:25.840 --> 39:30.080]  make the point because we have a wide-ranging audience even if you're not a christian let's
[39:30.080 --> 39:35.760]  say you're an agnostic out there listening is it a good idea to have the federal government
[39:35.760 --> 39:40.720]  coming in and telling churches what they can and can't say into the 501c3 is it good to have the
[39:40.720 --> 39:47.520]  church is twisting romans 13 hitler's favorite bible passage about the seizure i mean is it good
[39:48.400 --> 39:53.200]  to then have the majority of the nation that calls themselves christians saying i'm supposed to sit
[39:53.200 --> 39:58.080]  here and do nothing and not warn anybody how could somebody not want to go out and fight this system
[39:58.080 --> 40:03.280]  and any and again folks even if you don't believe in revelation and all of that like i do the point
[40:03.280 --> 40:08.880]  is is that is it a good idea to have a world government that you can't buy or sell without
[40:08.880 --> 40:14.320]  a thumbprint and a face scan what type of control does that give government and they are setting
[40:14.320 --> 40:19.600]  that system up they are stating it is for tyranny it is to bring in a one-child policy is to bring
[40:19.600 --> 40:23.760]  in feudalism serfdom eugenics i mean you know it's not just that we have a global government
[40:23.760 --> 40:29.280]  forming it's that it's it's run by a bunch of control freak tyrants and then when you study
[40:29.280 --> 40:35.520]  what those control freak tyrants believe in they're a cultist to a man so you know i just encourage
[40:35.520 --> 40:41.680]  people to investigate what the world elite actually believe in and then ask yourselves why do they
[40:41.680 --> 40:47.120]  hate christians so much and i don't mean your big national tv preachers i mean why do they hate
[40:47.120 --> 40:53.680]  real christians why is that pastor well i think because they know that you know we're the spirit
[40:53.680 --> 40:59.360]  of the lord is there's liberty uh... jesus christ uh... came to set me in free at the sun so when
[40:59.360 --> 41:06.240]  shall make you free you shall be free indeed uh... that jesus is the uh... is the personification
[41:06.240 --> 41:11.680]  of freedom uh... stand fast and the liberty with christ has made us free relations five one
[41:11.680 --> 41:15.920]  but let's go back to your to your statement a minute ago you know i've said in last year when
[41:15.920 --> 41:21.120]  i was on the campaign trail all over the country i i said this we either have freedom for all
[41:21.120 --> 41:26.160]  or we have freedom for none and it really doesn't matter whether a person is agnostic
[41:26.160 --> 41:32.240]  or christian or what is particular religious belief may or may not be uh... we either believe
[41:32.240 --> 41:36.400]  in the constitution the rule of law the principles of the declaration of independence we have
[41:36.400 --> 41:41.360]  freedom in this country to worship god the way we see fit to not worship god if that's what we
[41:41.360 --> 41:47.760]  see fit or we don't and so whether a person comes from a theological point of view of any kind or
[41:47.760 --> 41:52.240]  whether he comes from an atheistic point of view although i i believe that uh... agnostic
[41:52.240 --> 41:56.080]  and atheist has a difficult time understanding the real principles of freedom because i believe
[41:56.080 --> 42:00.160]  those principles are rooted and grounded in the teachings of natural law which are biblical
[42:00.720 --> 42:04.800]  regardless of whether what are our particular personal philosophy might be
[42:04.800 --> 42:08.720]  we either have freedom for everyone in this country or we have freedom for none
[42:08.720 --> 42:12.480]  and i think that is the key and and and believe it or not and this is one of the things when i was
[42:12.480 --> 42:18.080]  on the campaign trail last year that i really found amazing i i saw so many of my christian
[42:18.080 --> 42:26.240]  uh... specific pastors that seem to be in such a fog alex they just didn't have a clue they're
[42:26.240 --> 42:32.080]  under a spell they're under a spell he whether it's a 501c3 thing or whether it's they're afraid
[42:32.080 --> 42:36.800]  of their church congregations they're afraid of of losing their retirement programs or whatever
[42:36.800 --> 42:42.320]  it is they're sitting out there in a fog that without a clue and i found some people that
[42:42.320 --> 42:46.000]  were they would not identify themselves as churchgoers or christians
[42:46.000 --> 42:50.720]  and yet they're energized about fighting for freedom and so you know i've said this before
[42:50.720 --> 42:56.960]  you know i would rather vote for an unbeliever regardless of the office was president with
[42:56.960 --> 43:01.840]  its congressman senator with house rep the matter i would rather vote for an unbeliever
[43:02.400 --> 43:06.800]  who will preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states than to vote
[43:06.800 --> 43:11.840]  for a believer who would not preserve protected defend the constitution united states but we
[43:11.840 --> 43:15.440]  know that's a trick question because they're not really believers
[43:15.440 --> 43:18.000]  uh... you know in their heart if they're not fighting evil
[43:18.880 --> 43:23.440]  we understand that what i'm saying is you know everybody every every two years every four years
[43:23.440 --> 43:28.240]  everybody professes to be a christian if you're running for office yes people don't
[43:28.240 --> 43:32.560]  don't come out to vote for me i'm an agnostic exactly i don't want to hear talk i want to see
[43:32.560 --> 43:38.640]  action exactly but the point is is is that the the oath that every office holder takes from
[43:38.640 --> 43:43.600]  federal state local doesn't matter the oath they take is to preserve protect and defend
[43:43.600 --> 43:48.320]  the constitution in united states yes and that's what we need to hold them to and they're not
[43:48.320 --> 43:53.920]  doing it we we the people of the fortunately for the mass part have not held our elected
[43:53.920 --> 43:58.800]  officials accountable to the constitution and that includes republicans democrats it doesn't
[43:58.800 --> 44:04.080]  matter what side of the aisle and until we begin to hold our elected representatives accountable
[44:04.080 --> 44:09.200]  to the deck to the declaration the bill of rights the constitution united states we are not going
[44:09.200 --> 44:13.520]  to have good government and we are not going to maintain freedom in this country that's right
[44:13.520 --> 44:19.600]  now the clergy response teams i mean we have now twenty six thousand preachers covertly hired by
[44:19.600 --> 44:24.960]  fema it's now declassified years after we broke it here on the network uh...
[44:25.760 --> 44:30.640]  i mean this again is another sign of classical tyranny and pastor i don't know if you've seen
[44:30.640 --> 44:39.040]  this we just broke it yesterday at info wars dot com have you seen the americorps paramilitary
[44:39.040 --> 44:46.560]  propaganda ad where they're in red and black uniforms with khakis literally like something
[44:46.560 --> 44:53.120]  out of a fascist science fiction movie and then it does and then it tells me yeah i have not seen
[44:53.120 --> 44:57.200]  it but i will go to your website take a look at it and then it dovetails with government
[44:57.200 --> 45:02.400]  readiness youth corps to take on vets we see these drills with the boy scouts and and with
[45:02.400 --> 45:06.320]  public school groups all over the country where in the scenarios where they have the
[45:06.960 --> 45:11.520]  fourteen-year-old's training to take over you know law enforcement operations that they're
[45:11.520 --> 45:17.440]  fighting veterans and gun owners and then that dovetails with the mic report the dhs report
[45:17.440 --> 45:23.040]  i mean we have a clear picture now of what's going on here yeah that that's incredible i'll
[45:23.040 --> 45:28.000]  be glad to go take a look at that i'm glad that you all have put that up uh... you know really
[45:28.000 --> 45:32.320]  it goes back to what we said the outside of our discussion the the speed in which these things are
[45:32.320 --> 45:37.440]  taking place it's really difficult to imagine you know when when we first broke the when you
[45:37.440 --> 45:44.320]  broke the the dhs uh... report actually my c came from dhs in missouri and then i i picked it up
[45:44.320 --> 45:50.640]  in my column and went viral uh... and then the you know the support began to flood into the state
[45:50.640 --> 45:55.920]  of missouri they've since rescinded that report and they dismissed the person that put it out
[45:56.480 --> 46:01.120]  uh... and then it came to the dhs report and and the same thing you know people even
[46:02.000 --> 46:04.640]  congressmen began to speak out against it believe it or not
[46:05.200 --> 46:09.840]  and and then that report it was since taken down and then you've got peter king's bill that we
[46:09.840 --> 46:14.240]  started out talking about it in the other bill that you've just uh... brought out to my attention
[46:14.240 --> 46:21.680]  here today uh... you know these things are all and yet to use your phrase dovetailing together
[46:21.680 --> 46:26.560]  there's no question that there is a connection between all this anybody who thinks that these
[46:26.560 --> 46:31.760]  things are being done independently separately without connection uh... they they don't see
[46:31.760 --> 46:37.440]  the big picture there's no doubt that all of this is dovetailing into a common purpose
[46:37.440 --> 46:41.680]  a common goal and and i think really the ultimate goal here
[46:41.680 --> 46:46.800]  is to disarm the american people i think you know when you look at it when you look back over our
[46:46.800 --> 46:56.320]  history the only reason why we are still at least in in some semblance uh... the maintenance of
[46:56.320 --> 47:01.360]  freedom today the only reason we have that maintenance is because of the second amendment
[47:01.360 --> 47:07.120]  i mean i'm right and the globalist get that as the u n s said they will have their world government
[47:07.120 --> 47:11.760]  yeah it would that that would there's no question about it i mean how fortunate we were that our
[47:11.760 --> 47:16.800]  founding fathers were sagacious enough to put that second amendment in the constitution
[47:16.800 --> 47:23.040]  and and and that's that solid uh... historic gun culture that we've had throughout our history
[47:23.040 --> 47:27.680]  uh... has really been the salvation of our liberties to this point and i i think there's no
[47:27.680 --> 47:32.560]  question that they recognize that they the globalist recognize this and now that they're
[47:32.560 --> 47:39.920]  coming at this from multifaceted of perspective to try and i think the goal is to disarm the american
[47:39.920 --> 47:44.080]  people because without the the ability of the american people to defend themselves
[47:44.640 --> 47:50.400]  we are helpless against the machinations of evil men well pastor there's no debate i mean
[47:51.120 --> 47:55.840]  you have the white house chief of staff the attorney general and the president all introducing
[47:55.840 --> 48:00.720]  legislation in the past are arguing before federal courts are writing books and giving speeches
[48:00.720 --> 48:05.600]  and introducing legislation saying they want a total ban of the american people's firearms
[48:05.600 --> 48:11.200]  and then the asinine mainstream media saying we're conspiracy theorist you know that that this is just
[48:11.200 --> 48:18.160]  a i run on guns for no reason i mean i mean i mean this tactic they have always denying
[48:18.160 --> 48:23.520]  let's take some calls let's talk to paul in ohio paul you're on the air with uh... doctor
[48:23.520 --> 48:31.360]  paul one go ahead are you there yes we are okay they come and took all my guns the other day no
[48:31.360 --> 48:36.000]  warrant no nothing they come into my house they took every one of them that they could see but
[48:36.000 --> 48:40.880]  i've been listening to you buddy and i've been paying way good attention because i hit a bunch of them
[48:40.880 --> 48:45.200]  and they didn't get them off and that's why did they take your why did they say why did they say
[48:45.200 --> 48:51.600]  why did they say they took your guns no warrant no cause no reason they come in and took every gun
[48:51.600 --> 48:57.200]  that they could find they searched my home from top to bottom they let me stop you let me stop you
[48:57.200 --> 49:01.840]  and then i want to hear about this and then get past your bald ones take on it look i have three
[49:01.840 --> 49:07.680]  articles in my stack i haven't even gotten to where somebody buys 10 000 rounds of ammo at the gun
[49:07.680 --> 49:14.320]  store the vatf pulls them over down the street takes them to jail and gives them half a million
[49:14.320 --> 49:22.080]  dollar bail saying the ammo is illegal saying it's an arsenal and uh... they're now sending uh... vatf
[49:22.080 --> 49:27.120]  under homeland security to people's houses who buy a thousand rounds they're again acting like it's
[49:27.120 --> 49:32.720]  illegal and then they got the newspaper then they confiscated three handguns from the man's house and
[49:32.720 --> 49:38.480]  it goes on to say the guy has no criminal record i have these in the stack today and so this is
[49:38.480 --> 49:44.800]  going on uh... and i'm gonna hold you over paul but you know i mean that's another point uh...
[49:44.800 --> 49:49.920]  uh... chuck Baldwin is i this is uh... i know you're seeing these reports
[49:49.920 --> 49:53.680]  i see these reports every day where they just arrest people for the second amendment
[49:53.680 --> 50:00.880]  what is going on yeah that that that is incredible and i think we i think we know what's going on
[50:00.880 --> 50:05.200]  uh... it's it's the stuff that you talk about every day on your show it's it i you know i
[50:05.200 --> 50:08.480]  write about it there's a few others out there that are trying to sound the clarion call
[50:09.120 --> 50:15.040]  we know what's going on uh... and and alex i really i really think that ultimately
[50:16.880 --> 50:20.080]  that the maintenance of freedom is going to come down to the states
[50:20.960 --> 50:25.920]  and i don't know if you find that encouraging or discouraging but you know i i think it began
[50:25.920 --> 50:30.720]  with the states and i think it's going to end with the states we we are either going to maintain
[50:30.720 --> 50:35.760]  the freedom uh... that we find enumerated in the bill of rights at the state level
[50:36.400 --> 50:40.400]  or i think we are not going to maintain freedom at all i agree with you i think about 80 percent
[50:40.400 --> 50:44.800]  of the battle is there we need to can stay on the feds and all the treason going on and document
[50:44.800 --> 50:49.520]  and try to resist it but the real powers at the state level that's why we need more than 8 percent
[50:49.520 --> 50:55.600]  turnout in state elections instead of 50 something nationally the national stuff serves as a distraction
[50:55.600 --> 51:01.040]  paul stay there i want to hear your story when we get back stay with us
[51:01.040 --> 51:05.840]  less than a century ago half of the american public grew much of their own food today it's
[51:05.840 --> 51:10.960]  been estimated that only one percent of americans still grow their own food during a great depression
[51:10.960 --> 51:16.720]  over 18 million people suffered from starvation and as america continues down its current path
[51:16.720 --> 51:22.400]  for many the reality of another depression is a very serious concern with massive layoffs and

[54:35.280 --> 54:40.160]  your story but i've got news articles stacked up where they just come they take your guns they take
[54:40.160 --> 54:45.440]  your ammo and they say you shouldn't have had it most stories i see he's an insurance salesman
[54:45.440 --> 54:49.840]  54 he told his neighbors they ought to get storeable food because the economy might collapse
[54:49.840 --> 54:54.720]  the neighbors were scared to see him loading a firearm in his car so police swat team him took
[54:54.720 --> 54:59.520]  the ammo and guns and he's held without bail and then the article never says he's charged and later
[54:59.520 --> 55:06.080]  it comes out they're not charged it's just insane and the public doesn't know and the NRA won't
[55:06.080 --> 55:11.840]  tell you this is going on folks they're loyal opposition um Paul so what happened i mean the
[55:11.840 --> 55:16.800]  police showed up well i mean did you say why are you here when did this happen and this is the
[55:16.800 --> 55:23.360]  strangest story they were after me because of my energy cell and they came into my sister's house
[55:23.360 --> 55:28.960]  now this is not my house they came into her house took my nephews guns took her guns and
[55:28.960 --> 55:34.080]  everything like that because they want me they're looking for me because of what i can do to save
[55:34.080 --> 55:39.520]  people gas and i believe that if i've been able to finish what system i've got right now that i
[55:39.520 --> 55:44.720]  would absolutely be able to create enough electricity for every person to have me send me an email
[55:44.720 --> 55:48.880]  then ball i appreciate your call christian california christian on the air go ahead
[55:50.480 --> 55:55.040]  hi yeah i was just calling because i wanted to um text on the on the subject you were talking
[55:55.040 --> 55:59.760]  about earlier you guys just i want to go ahead the point yeah i just wanted to make a point that uh
[55:59.760 --> 56:03.440]  when it went to come down to it they're going to start getting divisive guys and i want everybody
[56:03.440 --> 56:08.400]  out there like black white mexican just to touch across the house the different races just so you

[56:17.360 --> 56:22.480]  that many people to be able to mediate it but but you're absolutely right uh christ the the the the
[56:22.480 --> 56:28.400]  liberals in the name of stopping racism all they do is talk about it hype it up say you're a racist
[56:28.400 --> 56:34.400]  if you disagree with obama injecting race so does the control right wing uh with you know limbaugh
[56:34.400 --> 56:40.080]  playing the songs he plays that is all meant to divide us uh pastor balwin he's got a great point
[56:41.600 --> 56:46.320]  oh there's no question again we have freedom for all of freedom for none and that this this
[56:46.320 --> 56:52.400]  cuts across uh not just theological lines but racial lines educational lines uh every other
[56:52.400 --> 56:58.720]  division that we have i mean freedom is universal and the beauty of what we're doing here is we're
[56:58.720 --> 57:05.440]  talking about the issue of freedom constitutional government liberty etc uh as you said it's the
[57:05.440 --> 57:10.160]  other side that interjects race and uses it to divide us and we can't afford to let that happen
[57:12.240 --> 57:18.080]  absolutely great point um and and thank you anything else chris yeah i i just wanted to

[57:43.760 --> 57:48.240]  to kind of you know no exactly the elite look the elite are talking about hundred and two hundred

[1:02:02.480 --> 1:02:09.040]  i'm the pastor to call you about the uh getting the letter from uh homeland security and i am
[1:02:09.040 --> 1:02:13.760]  getting that to you i had to wait for it to come back from another organization that wanted it
[1:02:13.760 --> 1:02:21.600]  to uh help me see what i can do about it and also i wanted to share with you i i sure did
[1:02:21.600 --> 1:02:27.120]  wish i could get on there with mr boldwin let me give you an idea if you have a letter you
[1:02:27.120 --> 1:02:32.080]  can just make photocopies of it and then not wait while it goes to one person and then back to you
[1:02:32.080 --> 1:02:37.520]  yeah i know i messed up on that one oh you'd already mailed it out yeah why don't you
[1:02:37.520 --> 1:02:42.720]  refresh people's memory hold on just second hold just a second what a lot of folks didn't hear that one
[1:02:42.720 --> 1:02:48.560]  call weeks ago why don't you recap so people know what we're talking about okay i received uh two
[1:02:48.560 --> 1:02:55.600]  letters from department of homeland security and uh and the homeland security slash fema
[1:02:56.560 --> 1:03:02.880]  and i'm just a little home church so i figure the way i consider that i figure i got it by
[1:03:02.880 --> 1:03:08.400]  mistake because they've been hitting the bigger churches and boy have i got more information
[1:03:08.400 --> 1:03:13.600]  for you for that too they've actually hit them here too but i'll give you that but anyway i got the
[1:03:13.600 --> 1:03:20.480]  letter uh of course they were saying you know me being 501c3 or 3c exempt and all that which
[1:03:20.480 --> 1:03:27.440]  were not we chose not to be that which was a mistake and second of all they uh stated that in
[1:03:27.440 --> 1:03:34.240]  case of an emergency they may need uh the the clergy or the pastors in given areas to help
[1:03:34.800 --> 1:03:41.200]  them in in uh the safeguarding of people directing them you know to certain areas things like that
[1:03:41.760 --> 1:03:46.080]  and uh and then once you're recruited for those that don't know it's the clergy response team
[1:03:46.080 --> 1:03:51.280]  they want to recruit all the preachers they're up to 26 000 last time we checked to covertly
[1:03:51.280 --> 1:03:54.960]  because we got the training manuals tell them to go to fema camps tell them to take shots tell them
[1:03:54.960 --> 1:04:00.880]  to turn their guns in to preach romans 13 then we had mainline preachers on national news saying the
[1:04:00.880 --> 1:04:05.440]  same thing so now even home churches are getting these and i don't think it was a mistake you
[1:04:05.440 --> 1:04:10.320]  not signing up for the 501c3 you waive your liberties and your freedoms under the first
[1:04:10.320 --> 1:04:14.640]  amendment when you contract with these guys that's how they get around the separation of church and
[1:04:14.640 --> 1:04:21.680]  state and the first amendment and federalize the churches okay but but uh keep going past
[1:04:21.680 --> 1:04:26.720]  her then we'll hold you over so yes so you got this letter go ahead i got the letter and they're
[1:04:26.720 --> 1:04:32.560]  quoting roman's uh chapter 13 verses one through seven yeah the feds quoting to you
[1:04:32.560 --> 1:04:39.040]  romans 13 i mean is that not creepy well it's their own interpretation just like it was that
[1:04:39.040 --> 1:04:44.080]  woman's own interpretation here sunday or the other day when i was listening to you because he
[1:04:44.080 --> 1:04:50.880]  mentioned the pastor that uh told me that i was me reading from the the wrong version well i actually

[1:09:08.400 --> 1:09:16.080]  and marines are running illegal checkpoints we told people in 2007 no 2006 we got the secret
[1:09:16.080 --> 1:09:20.720]  fema documents that they had 13 000 preachers covertly trained to tell their flocks to go to
[1:09:20.720 --> 1:09:27.760]  fema camps to take force inoculations to turn their guns in romans 13 then it came out mainstream
[1:09:27.760 --> 1:09:35.360]  news 2008 early 2008 national newscast local newscast we played them here with preachers saying
[1:09:35.360 --> 1:09:39.680]  it's romans 13 that the people are bad and got to do what their government says and the government's
[1:09:39.680 --> 1:09:45.280]  number one threat is us the people and we need the army to take our guns it's of the lord i mean you
[1:09:45.280 --> 1:09:50.320]  can't make this stuff up now they've got all these bills introduced to restrict free speech and arrest
[1:09:50.320 --> 1:09:56.160]  you for free speech and to take your guns and put you on secret list and yeah they're sending out
[1:09:56.160 --> 1:10:01.360]  we've confirmed this we've got tons of these letters and things coming in uh where the preachers
[1:10:01.360 --> 1:10:05.680]  are being told and i told you raymond teague two years ago came in from his big baptist church in
[1:10:05.680 --> 1:10:13.120]  dropping springs and they told him they said uh well he brought me the letter and it was his
[1:10:13.120 --> 1:10:18.720]  preachers you know got up and said in the sermon don't talk about the parking lot if you go to a
[1:10:18.720 --> 1:10:25.760]  church dinner the members can't talk about politics or who they support coming up in the 2008 election
[1:10:26.720 --> 1:10:30.400]  you know now the people don't have free speech if you're a christian you don't have free speech
[1:10:30.400 --> 1:10:36.240]  folks the first you know let's say christians are not need gelded conditioned brainwashed
[1:10:36.240 --> 1:10:40.000]  and let's just say you believe you're supposed to worship government and do whatever it says
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:44.240]  and the founding fathers were bad and we were bad to fight hitler and you know all governments of
[1:10:44.240 --> 1:10:48.160]  god and jesus should have done what the devil said because he's the god of this world and he
[1:10:48.160 --> 1:10:52.880]  offered him the whole world up on the mountain let's just say that's the case and the communist
[1:10:52.880 --> 1:10:56.800]  chinese church you know the church of the state that told christians it was of god to worship
[1:10:56.800 --> 1:11:00.960]  the government the soviet controlled church was good and the east german controlled church was good
[1:11:00.960 --> 1:11:05.840]  and you know uh the cuban controlled church was good let's just say all of that is good and
[1:11:05.840 --> 1:11:11.520]  government's supposed to run religion but wait a minute the first amendment the bill of rights says
[1:11:11.520 --> 1:11:16.720]  congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise
[1:11:16.720 --> 1:11:21.520]  thereof so this is a government for and by the people so we're supposed to follow the bill of
[1:11:21.520 --> 1:11:27.040]  rights and it says it's illegal to have government involved in religion and see the control left
[1:11:27.040 --> 1:11:30.720]  always said oh you're not supposed to be able to have a bible in school they throw in the trash
[1:11:30.720 --> 1:11:34.960]  all the time they they arrest you if you're caught with them you know if you try to go pray on a
[1:11:34.960 --> 1:11:40.160]  campus they arrest you you know uh allen keys still in jail for a week and a half by the way
[1:11:40.160 --> 1:11:44.640]  they're just they're saying well we're going to keep you in jail because you prayed you know for
[1:11:44.640 --> 1:11:57.840]  Notre Dame and so they set this precedent and you're not supposed to have the government doing
[1:11:57.840 --> 1:12:04.800]  this i mean that's so creepy that's such tyranny that's so 1984 and i get these hundreds of emails
[1:12:04.800 --> 1:12:10.080]  a week and i see them on our youtube videos going alex jones is of the devil he should submit to

[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:24.080]  and they're the soft weak really demonic christians uh and they just revel in worshiping government
[1:12:24.080 --> 1:12:28.880]  and revel and having no responsibility and revel and when they have their kids taken by the government
[1:12:28.880 --> 1:12:33.120]  for no reasons they praise god and say oh it's the end of the world i'll be raptured soon listen

[1:13:45.040 --> 1:13:51.840]  way you know you you supported george bush when he said they were having secret arrest and secret
[1:13:51.840 --> 1:13:56.240]  torture and now you whine and complain when you find out homeland security is really for
[1:13:56.240 --> 1:14:01.680]  conservatives and gun owners what did you expect you stupid fools you're the ones that own property
[1:14:01.680 --> 1:14:09.120]  in our middle class you're the targets now pastor uh terry was calling from ohio he has a home church
[1:14:09.120 --> 1:14:15.760]  i think he said 30 members and he even got the letter telling him look your 501c3 which he's not
[1:14:15.760 --> 1:14:21.600]  you're under orders no free speech you don't criticize the government well even under the 501c3
[1:14:21.600 --> 1:14:27.200]  baloney you can criticize government policies and abortion and things it's just you can't
[1:14:27.200 --> 1:14:31.920]  endorse political candidates but see even under that they've expanded it but see that's the
[1:14:31.920 --> 1:14:37.600]  lawyer trick just like there's no law you got to take a vaccine they trick you and the school kicks
[1:14:37.600 --> 1:14:44.960]  you out and then they put in truancy laws into place to then say you've been truent and they
[1:14:44.960 --> 1:14:52.400]  come arrest you and your kid but you're not being arrested for no shot it's a lawyer trick same thing
[1:14:52.400 --> 1:14:58.000]  here oh they go oh the 50s didn't have 501c3 they said oh churches yeah your tax exempt just fill
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:02.480]  out this form and trusting americans you know we'd won world war two we were the good guys
[1:15:02.480 --> 1:15:06.880]  that the churches said oh yeah there's a new government wants us just to you know we have
[1:15:06.880 --> 1:15:11.680]  our tax exemption and i've seen the old 50s forms they even lied and said oh we know you have a
[1:15:11.680 --> 1:15:16.720]  first amendment just we need you to do this for for tax reasons and and the big denominations
[1:15:16.720 --> 1:15:21.120]  taken over by the world council of churches financed by the un and the Rockefeller foundations
[1:15:21.120 --> 1:15:26.560]  and forward foundation told the baptist and the methodists and the catholics and all the big
[1:15:26.560 --> 1:15:34.400]  christian you know faiths denominations just fill this out and so they did it then they went to
[1:15:34.400 --> 1:15:38.960]  small church and said do this then they swat teamed a few and so most of them got scared and did it
[1:15:38.960 --> 1:15:45.440]  in the 80s congress can make no law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting
[1:15:45.440 --> 1:15:49.840]  the free exercise thereof and i look i know a bunch of party and you know you you know you go to
[1:15:49.840 --> 1:15:55.200]  the dance halls and you and and and you don't want to hear about religion okay over 200 million
[1:15:55.200 --> 1:15:59.520]  people call themselves christians in this nation hundreds of millions every week go to church
[1:16:00.400 --> 1:16:04.800]  this matters politically to everybody that the government's taken over the church remember the
[1:16:04.800 --> 1:16:10.000]  democrats didn't like bush and the and the 10 billion a year for faith-based initiative to buy
[1:16:10.000 --> 1:16:16.400]  them off and now obama saying he's gonna double that suddenly democrats love it it's bipartisan
[1:16:17.280 --> 1:16:21.760]  so whatever happened to separation of church and state it means the churches can do whatever they
[1:16:21.760 --> 1:16:30.560]  want but the government can't be involved because you have no jurisdiction congress shall make
[1:16:30.560 --> 1:16:36.240]  no law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof you
[1:16:36.240 --> 1:16:42.640]  have no purview but they trick you and say oh you're a charity sign sign into this 501c3
[1:16:44.880 --> 1:16:50.800]  and they did it and now 50 something years later we're in bondage now i'm done ranning i said i'd
[1:16:50.800 --> 1:16:57.520]  take your calls pastor terry just just just finish up about this letter okay i got this letter and
[1:16:57.520 --> 1:17:03.440]  and and what i did was is i have people you know wanted to see it so they could help me out in it
[1:17:03.440 --> 1:17:09.040]  legally and that's why i allowed it to go out while i'm getting it back in you're going to get it
[1:17:09.040 --> 1:17:13.280]  another thing and something else i would say if you want already have hundreds but sure go ahead
[1:17:13.280 --> 1:17:19.360]  okay and something else too every i listen to you and steve quill and and everything you you
[1:17:19.360 --> 1:17:24.880]  have said has come to pass and and i i tell you what i've listened to you and i've even i even go
[1:17:24.880 --> 1:17:30.400]  a little deeper because i when i teach i like to teach the same way christ did you know put a
[1:17:30.400 --> 1:17:34.960]  little modern-day history in with you know what's going on in the world so people would understand
[1:17:34.960 --> 1:17:40.880]  you know what i'm saying and the information i get from from your show and such helps me but i also
[1:17:41.520 --> 1:17:46.480]  got online and get information too and you know back in the at the beginning of this country
[1:17:46.480 --> 1:17:52.240]  before there was even a constitution when people you know begin to fight against england against
[1:17:52.240 --> 1:17:57.840]  their tyranny they used god's word to stand up and do it they didn't even have a constitution
[1:17:57.840 --> 1:18:03.680]  they used the whole bible is about resisting tyranny and it was called the black brigades
[1:18:03.680 --> 1:18:09.680]  because back then preachers of all denominations wore black and uh and they were the first one to
[1:18:09.680 --> 1:18:14.400]  stand up against it no it was actually preachers that led it now that's why the government's moving
[1:18:14.400 --> 1:18:19.040]  to take over the churches but but go ahead and send that and all pastors should send that
[1:18:19.040 --> 1:18:24.160]  to us who are getting these letters uh and we'll get an article up about it in the near future
[1:18:24.160 --> 1:18:29.040]  and uh can i share something with you sure but i just want to explain something to you sir sir sir
[1:18:29.920 --> 1:18:34.880]  when they when the when the roaring lion of government comes up and roars seeing
[1:18:34.880 --> 1:18:40.240]  who it may devour seeing if we cower and fall down you never signed the 501 c3 you never
[1:18:40.240 --> 1:18:45.280]  waived your rights you're a home church so you're running around saying what do i need legally
[1:18:45.280 --> 1:18:50.560]  because some scumbag in the government sends you a letter saying you got a bow down and no
[1:18:50.560 --> 1:18:56.480]  and have no free speech it's total bull so i don't know who you sent it to to get advice from
[1:18:57.040 --> 1:19:00.960]  most of the big church groups are funded and controlled by the government so they'll lie to
[1:19:00.960 --> 1:19:05.280]  you but i mean if you haven't signed a 501 c3 which you said may have been a mistake
[1:19:05.920 --> 1:19:09.920]  what what i mean you got some jackass telling you that that's a mistake you gotta waive your rights
[1:19:09.920 --> 1:19:16.240]  and shine a contract with the government no i did did been doing research and i found a senate

[1:39:35.600 --> 1:39:41.200]  courage this year it was reported by jim tucker the worst security ever two and a half miles away
[1:39:41.200 --> 1:39:47.760]  they were arresting people detaining people uh secret police following everybody tucker said
[1:39:47.760 --> 1:39:53.840]  it was the worst he ever saw also charlie uh skelton of the guardian got arrested twice
[1:39:53.840 --> 1:39:59.440]  detained another time got roughed up by security that's now headlines the london guardian and he
[1:39:59.440 --> 1:40:03.600]  went there like this was all a big joke but it's not a big joke now he kind of had an awakening
[1:40:03.600 --> 1:40:08.720]  and then uh so we'll be going over that uh mr dorna new thank you for joining us
[1:40:09.680 --> 1:40:17.200]  hello alec good to have you on where are you now uh on the road uh actually i'm at my home
[1:40:17.200 --> 1:40:23.760]  i arrived this morning for the straight uh drive so you're so you're not that far from
[1:40:23.760 --> 1:40:30.800]  greece how long did it take you to get back to uh where you're from in romania about 15 hours okay
[1:40:30.800 --> 1:40:37.040]  okay well start at the beginning i'm going to try to just sit back and have you break it down
[1:40:37.040 --> 1:40:41.200]  what did you see uh when did you arrive what did you witness what happened to you
[1:40:42.480 --> 1:40:49.520]  well i arrived there for the uh evening uh with a friend of mine to help me with the footage
[1:40:51.040 --> 1:40:59.200]  his name is florian last name is serbu and um basically what we noticed there from the beginning
[1:40:59.200 --> 1:41:05.600]  and i have to agree completely with jim talker is that uh the security was uh
[1:41:06.560 --> 1:41:15.120]  worse than i've seen uh in 2007 in istanbul and what i've seen other times from other reports
[1:41:15.120 --> 1:41:23.920]  basically the police uh i think the police took uh the job to secure the place and the army the
[1:41:23.920 --> 1:41:30.320]  great army i i don't haven't seen uh very much of special forces like i've seen before from uh
[1:41:30.960 --> 1:41:37.920]  maybe u.s military or something like that but uh from the pictures i took uh i thought um we
[1:41:37.920 --> 1:41:45.360]  pulled up there for for example military one uh past boat uh with guns heavy guns uh uh
[1:41:46.240 --> 1:41:53.360]  great military navy on the sea that was patrolling around the hotel uh police helicopter from
[1:41:53.360 --> 1:42:02.080]  surveilling the area when we arrived uh basically it was uh very animated uh and uh police uh
[1:42:03.280 --> 1:42:11.360]  cars police uh bikes were coming and going everywhere uh the traffic was restricted
[1:42:12.320 --> 1:42:19.360]  so we basically went ahead uh meant to try to see what's going on uh the reconnaissance part
[1:42:19.360 --> 1:42:26.080]  and uh that's when we were observed the end of pictures of the helicopter uh that was the first
[1:42:26.080 --> 1:42:35.520]  day and we didn't uh we later uh have seen a few more limo black cars with black windows
[1:42:36.320 --> 1:42:43.680]  that were escorted by police and uh i haven't was this last wednesday uh poor day actually
[1:42:43.680 --> 1:42:49.920]  okay thursday so the first real day it kicks off uh when did you start seeing them uh detain people
[1:42:49.920 --> 1:42:54.320]  and then we heard there were some demonstrations that looked staged by the communist and the
[1:42:54.320 --> 1:43:01.920]  nationalist uh please continue well my second day uh there uh which is friday 15 uh i was uh
[1:43:01.920 --> 1:43:10.640]  walking uh on the road uh walking towards the uh after palace hotel and i met this guy this
[1:43:10.640 --> 1:43:19.280]  week i called his his name and uh he told us uh guys you know that that they are uh arresting the
[1:43:19.280 --> 1:43:28.000]  things of people with cameras and i said well i haven't heard that before uh so well we took a
[1:43:28.000 --> 1:43:34.240]  walk and uh we managed to take a picture of the hotel where two people were standing in the balcony
[1:43:34.240 --> 1:43:42.560]  and uh i wanted to change the lenses and get a bigger lens zoom lens to get a closer picture
[1:43:42.560 --> 1:43:51.520]  with them and as soon as i put my uh my backpack on the ground uh a few police cars and motorcycles
[1:43:51.520 --> 1:43:56.880]  arrived and started asking questions that's when we started not getting that footage i don't know if
[1:43:56.880 --> 1:44:04.560]  you've seen it uh yes we were surrounded by cops and they had in uh telling us that we cannot take
[1:44:04.560 --> 1:44:10.160]  pictures to the hotel now now they advertise uh paul and then we'll continue with the story
[1:44:10.160 --> 1:44:13.920]  they advertise Greece as if it's part of the european union it's supposedly free
[1:44:15.200 --> 1:44:19.600]  but clearly bill de berg gave the order to stop any photos because they're tired of us
[1:44:19.600 --> 1:44:25.360]  showing the queen of the netherlands and david rockfeller and british royalty and others being
[1:44:25.360 --> 1:44:31.120]  there uh so i mean clearly this sounds like soviet russia during the 1980s please continue
[1:44:32.080 --> 1:44:39.440]  exactly ma well i i i think even personally through some of the cops uh in civilian or
[1:44:40.720 --> 1:44:48.960]  regular cops and basically well what they told us is that first of all they were very friendly
[1:44:48.960 --> 1:44:56.800]  who are uh only uh some security people there were very very angry and they were giving orders
[1:44:56.800 --> 1:45:04.720]  uh they had stations uh radio stations all of them and they were saying to the radio to you know
[1:45:04.720 --> 1:45:09.680]  take this guy and like that but also you saw private security people or what looked like
[1:45:09.680 --> 1:45:15.520]  plain clothes uh private security man been uh uh uh telling the police to be rougher with you
[1:45:15.520 --> 1:45:24.960]  exactly exactly uh even now when uh richard uh richard terby uh from ireland was arrested
[1:45:24.960 --> 1:45:33.040]  uh basically he took a picture of such a such a man uh and then uh that meant for the the police
[1:45:33.040 --> 1:45:40.640]  to uh get him is that okay so clearly the bill de berg's security then was giving orders to the
[1:45:40.640 --> 1:45:44.880]  police and that's what we've heard from everybody that the police didn't really like violating
[1:45:44.880 --> 1:45:52.080]  the the press's rights but we're clearly under orders from higher up uh to do this and so go back
[1:45:52.080 --> 1:45:56.000]  over the the gentleman from ireland because we're going to be doing a story on this mr doran new
[1:45:56.000 --> 1:46:01.680]  as you know for prisonplanet.com which has been the global leader uh if you click under google news
[1:46:01.680 --> 1:46:05.600]  where we're getting more hits right now in the guardian in the new york times and others that
[1:46:05.600 --> 1:46:09.440]  have been uh in the wall street journal that have been reporting on this so it's important to get all
[1:46:09.440 --> 1:46:15.920]  the facts uh so specifically you're you're confirming bill de berg was ordering people have
[1:46:15.920 --> 1:46:25.040]  their their their uh videotapes uh their photos stolen that allows civil action now against the
[1:46:25.040 --> 1:46:30.960]  private bill de berg group based out of a private corporate office uh in the netherlands so please
[1:46:30.960 --> 1:46:39.440]  continue exactly uh well my i myself was i was detained two times actually second time was uh worse
[1:46:39.440 --> 1:46:46.240]  than the first time the first time we got detained uh uh meeting my friend and uh that great guy we
[1:46:46.240 --> 1:46:52.160]  were detained for about an hour uh during that time they probably brought some checks on on
[1:46:52.160 --> 1:46:59.040]  outside the police station and then let us free they didn't uh uh check our cameras or whatever
[1:46:59.040 --> 1:47:06.560]  we recorded now the second time was worse because uh it was uh yesterday one uh bill de berg
[1:47:06.560 --> 1:47:14.480]  was uh started to leave and my friend started taking pictures with limos and uh basically it
[1:47:14.480 --> 1:47:25.520]  uh uh they were all together in that park near near the police barricade and uh they were friendly
[1:47:25.520 --> 1:47:34.880]  with us and uh suddenly uh it seems that uh this police guy uh in civilian uh dressed
[1:47:34.880 --> 1:47:44.240]  uh very good like a number of people uh got radioed and uh got very angry because uh he was told to
[1:47:44.240 --> 1:47:50.640]  basically take us and he came to us uh he asked for our ideas and told us we're a friendly world
[1:47:50.640 --> 1:47:55.520]  you have to go down for five minutes before we face around some checks again on you and let me
[1:47:55.520 --> 1:47:59.920]  stop you uh let's be specific uh mr. darner because i want to get this right yes you're
[1:47:59.920 --> 1:48:04.400]  saying the officers were being friendly to you and then he got irritated when he got the radio
[1:48:04.400 --> 1:48:08.480]  call was he irritated with you or irritated that they were ordering him to arrest you
[1:48:09.040 --> 1:48:14.640]  here it really is that they get the word that will arrest us so that so they didn't want to arrest you
[1:48:14.640 --> 1:48:19.920]  thank you exactly now let's be clear the cops when they falsely arrest you always call it
[1:48:19.920 --> 1:48:26.160]  detaining when you're stuck in a police car and taken you were arrested without charge you were
[1:48:26.160 --> 1:48:31.920]  arrested falsely arrested and then released without charge so that's why they keep telling you you
[1:48:31.920 --> 1:48:37.840]  were detained because they know what they've done is unlawful and you have a claim against them and
[1:48:37.840 --> 1:48:41.360]  even if the cops don't like it there were lots of germans didn't like blowing people's heads off
[1:48:41.360 --> 1:48:45.680]  but they still did it you know there were lots of folks didn't like uh you know having you know
[1:48:45.680 --> 1:48:50.800]  to hang black runaway slaves but they still hung them and just because you don't like
[1:48:50.800 --> 1:48:54.640]  you know oh i had to rob a bank i was real sad about it i don't like it but i have to rob it
[1:48:55.200 --> 1:49:02.960]  those police officers are not above the law now more importantly you and others that were
[1:49:02.960 --> 1:49:08.160]  arrested including the irishman uh and and and and the and the brett reporter for the guardian
[1:49:08.160 --> 1:49:16.880]  and they need to file suit against the bill de berg group uh for uh soliciting your arrest
[1:49:17.680 --> 1:49:22.560]  and and then that will open all this up in court we need to go after these bastards now
[1:49:22.560 --> 1:49:28.880]  mr doran please continue yes i was uh considering doing uh such an action uh first to talk with
[1:49:30.000 --> 1:49:37.840]  the foreign minister in my country good uh to ask them uh why was i uh detained or arrested
[1:49:37.840 --> 1:49:44.560]  the time uh because the second time uh well i get uh really i think that's what they wanted uh you
[1:49:44.560 --> 1:49:50.960]  were kidnapped sir you were you you were shanghai four hours there uh four hours four hours there
[1:49:50.960 --> 1:50:00.800]  uh actually uh we were in total of six people there uh some of uh one guy uh hadn't had anything
[1:50:00.800 --> 1:50:06.560]  to do with us he was an american from colorado and he was just sitting on the bank near us
[1:50:06.560 --> 1:50:12.320]  and uh he was taken as well even yeah let's be clear this is in the middle of a gore yeah exactly
[1:50:12.320 --> 1:50:17.840]  this is a no camera this is in the middle of just a gorgeous tourist area and they shut down the
[1:50:17.840 --> 1:50:23.360]  entire palace with three huge hotels and then there's a huge bay with boats and ships and people
[1:50:23.360 --> 1:50:29.520]  on the beach with volleyball's and they were just grabbing people uh explain that to people
[1:50:29.520 --> 1:50:36.160]  exactly so well basically we're just spending their time to take a picture with the uh the
[1:50:36.160 --> 1:50:44.080]  cars uh that were passed by the limo also billable and they came to us and so we need to go to the
[1:50:44.080 --> 1:50:48.880]  police uh stay there but you're saying they also arrested just an american tourist who didn't have
[1:50:48.880 --> 1:50:55.440]  a camera exactly exactly it was just uh guilty by association he was just coming there without

[2:02:50.960 --> 2:02:56.880]  for and after that uh they uh you know put the batteries back into our cameras and the tapes
[2:02:56.880 --> 2:03:05.360]  and uh they had us show them what we uh filmed what we uh what pictures we have taken of and uh

[2:11:25.040 --> 2:11:29.440]  talk to the press about this which was a moral what he was doing because i just lied i mean in
[2:11:29.440 --> 2:11:34.400]  emergency situation when i'm with feds in a foreign country telling me that i don't have
[2:11:34.400 --> 2:11:39.840]  a free speech and i promise to shut up oh yes oh i i promise i'm not going to talk about this
[2:11:42.560 --> 2:11:47.760]  as soon as i was out of canada i did though i mean i mean come because this is warfare folks
[2:11:49.280 --> 2:11:54.080]  you know when you're behind bars and they're asking you to promise to waive your rights i uh
[2:11:54.080 --> 2:11:58.080]  but i knew he was going to release me anyways i mean i didn't want him to taser me to death or
[2:11:58.080 --> 2:12:02.240]  do the other stuff that uh canadian customs is well known for murdering people in full view of
[2:12:02.240 --> 2:12:09.040]  cameras i'm not kidding so i um i told him oh yes i promise one of the few times i lie i'm pretty
[2:12:09.040 --> 2:12:14.480]  much trained to never lie but i guess in the bible you know when they uh had the spies going into the
[2:12:14.480 --> 2:12:21.200]  city was that with giddy and what story was that and they had the uh you know ladies in the there's
[2:12:21.200 --> 2:12:25.920]  actually the prostitutes and they reported you know that you know they lied to i mean i guess
[2:12:25.920 --> 2:12:32.080]  if i was like a nazi germany they came and they said uh are are you jewish and i was jewish then
[2:12:32.080 --> 2:12:36.960]  i would say no i'm not jewish and i guess i'd go to hell for that but uh whatever uh let's go back
[2:12:36.960 --> 2:12:44.080]  to a paul uh dorna new um paul you are on the uh airsir anything else you want to add about how
[2:12:44.080 --> 2:12:47.840]  this went so they're threatening you they said we're going to bring in before a judge what happened
[2:12:47.840 --> 2:12:51.920]  after that uh what about being followed secret police what did you witness on that front what
[2:12:51.920 --> 2:12:57.840]  happened to the irish guy that got arrested anything else you haven't covered well uh there are
[2:12:57.840 --> 2:13:04.240]  lots of things to do uh to be said paul uh like for example there were other police officers
[2:13:04.240 --> 2:13:10.480]  hiring a rank who came to us and interrogated us asking question one of them was uh asking me
[2:13:10.480 --> 2:13:19.200]  directly if i'm stupid and if he's stupid if you like uh looks like uh stupid uh and kept asking me
[2:13:19.200 --> 2:13:25.200]  if uh if it's legal in my country if it's legal in my country to take pictures of cops and i said
[2:13:25.200 --> 2:13:31.840]  yes uh legal to take pictures of cops in my country mania even with the hidden cameras uh because
[2:13:31.840 --> 2:13:40.160]  that's uh that's why they were uh so i said so in the end uh mom uh another more security guy came
[2:13:40.160 --> 2:13:47.680]  uh again uh he was he asked us questions uh again uh let me just add here interrupt you uh
[2:13:47.680 --> 2:13:53.280]  this is important and continue with the more senior guys coming door to know that they've
[2:13:53.280 --> 2:13:57.920]  got cameras who are veiling us they watch us they listen to us without warrants illegally and then
[2:13:57.920 --> 2:14:03.040]  they're out guarding criminals at the side of a beach resort and you're not supposed to show them
[2:14:03.920 --> 2:14:09.040]  and the cops do that here too they say don't take me you're not god you're not above the law
[2:14:09.040 --> 2:14:13.440]  and don't you police understand it's the bill of rights and constitution protecting your wealth
[2:14:13.440 --> 2:14:18.800]  your name your family's future don't you guys get off your little thumbs suckin feeling sorry for
[2:14:18.800 --> 2:14:26.720]  yourself power trips so now more high-level guys come what happens next okay so uh basically we
[2:14:26.720 --> 2:14:33.840]  were uh after four hours we were released by uh as i uh dressed to be leon uh but i think was
[2:14:33.840 --> 2:14:41.520]  the security guy was more i don't know just uh something like that security uh staff or something
[2:14:41.520 --> 2:14:49.200]  like that and uh when we left we noticed that uh much of the uh police went away so we realized
[2:14:49.200 --> 2:14:57.120]  the part was over most of the billaboo have left already so they did say not to not be able to take
[2:14:57.120 --> 2:15:02.400]  pictures of the car leaving and and i think the most important thing you've talked about here is
[2:15:02.400 --> 2:15:08.240]  that your free speech was violated european union laws were violated but well we know they're written
[2:15:08.240 --> 2:15:15.520]  to do that and they were doing this under orders of bill berg security which you witnessed and it
[2:15:15.520 --> 2:15:21.600]  was also navy and marines there according to mainstream news navy and marines and reportedly
[2:15:21.600 --> 2:15:29.200]  army uh so this is a big deal and we appreciate your courage i managed to take a lot of pictures
[2:15:29.200 --> 2:15:37.200]  with uh actually uh put them on a website where i gave you the link uh with uh security on the sea
[2:15:38.240 --> 2:15:48.320]  navy ship uh special forces and others with the big guns on the sea there's a very good
[2:15:48.320 --> 2:15:59.200]  footage i took from uh from the boat we went on Saturday paul doran anything else you'd like to add
[2:15:59.200 --> 2:16:06.800]  from romanium well uh i don't know uh i'll try to gather my thoughts because i'm not there i only
[2:16:06.800 --> 2:16:13.360]  left uh half an hour mark since uh yesterday morning and uh i still have friends to do uh
[2:16:13.360 --> 2:16:20.080]  like another month of tv not talk to us and so and because the media here must have covered
[2:16:20.080 --> 2:16:27.840]  my covering this uh incident uh with me and uh the bill berg conference uh pretty heavy last few
[2:16:27.840 --> 2:16:34.880]  days well see you're doing your job and i know you got inspired by other info warriors uh years ago
[2:16:34.880 --> 2:16:40.720]  to go out and take action and now that's waking more people up and then people will become inspired
[2:16:40.720 --> 2:16:45.920]  by you uh in your nation to keep romania free from tyranny and certainly romanians have seen
[2:16:45.920 --> 2:16:49.760]  tyranny that's why you have a lot of liberties there now because people fought for them and all
[2:16:49.760 --> 2:16:54.560]  liberty is fought for and you got to fight to keep it and so uh you are just doing a better
[2:16:54.560 --> 2:16:59.920]  and better job and uh growing and growing uh paul doran anew and we just really appreciate all the

[2:17:40.400 --> 2:17:48.720]  russian um dutch news greek news big papers in the uk i've seen four big papers report on it
[2:17:49.760 --> 2:17:54.000]  nothing in the us but the wall street journal in the ap and the wall street journal makes a big
[2:17:54.000 --> 2:18:00.560]  joke oh big deal so-called secret meeting not so secret some leaders are meeting no big deal
[2:18:00.560 --> 2:18:06.000]  well it's no big deal why did us media say none of this existed for decades why do they say you
[2:18:06.000 --> 2:18:10.240]  were a crazy cook if you talked about it why are you arrested if you try to cover it why has
[2:18:10.240 --> 2:18:14.160]  bill bergen groups own minutes been released over the years where they are literally setting
[2:18:14.160 --> 2:18:20.320]  world policy with world leaders and telling them what to do this is big news this is important
[2:18:20.320 --> 2:18:25.200]  and we are sick and tired of it and we're tired of being harassed and death-threaded and everything
[2:18:25.200 --> 2:18:31.120]  else that we go through to bring people this information so notice the act like it doesn't
[2:18:31.120 --> 2:18:36.000]  exist and then when we do expose it they go okay big deal don't look at that nobody cares let's just
[2:18:36.000 --> 2:18:42.000]  move along oh big deal you showed some in fact that's what the uh he's on the trilateral commission

[2:25:23.760 --> 2:25:30.720]  how it ties into this it's better to just show you the video here is one of many
[2:25:30.720 --> 2:25:39.440]  videos out there of the obama brigade you know we showed people during the obama's campaign
[2:25:39.440 --> 2:25:45.440]  people in camo chanting for obama and then we showed obama saying you want some military
[2:25:45.440 --> 2:25:49.840]  domestic security force and the fact that republicans wanted it as well it's bipartisan
[2:25:50.560 --> 2:25:55.760]  but that he could get the popular support to actually energize it and now they're announcing
[2:25:55.760 --> 2:26:01.040]  and they're training already boy scouts to quote take on veterans and gun owners that's in the new
[2:26:01.040 --> 2:26:05.840]  york times and the homeland security documents say the number one threat to homeland security is
[2:26:05.840 --> 2:26:10.560]  veterans and gun owners of the whole system set up for them and in the article written by curtain
[2:26:10.560 --> 2:26:17.040]  memo he links directly to city year and other subdivisions of americor and secure core where
[2:26:17.040 --> 2:26:21.360]  they state they're under homeland security to carry out homeland security duties including
[2:26:21.360 --> 2:26:27.200]  intelligence gathering so what you're about to see our spies doing paramilitary training
[2:26:28.800 --> 2:26:33.440]  and they then mix in martin wither king and gondy with it martin wither king and gondy
[2:26:33.440 --> 2:26:39.920]  were fighting secret police and spies and fascism but it puts a nice liberal you know
[2:26:39.920 --> 2:26:47.040]  drum circle uh angle on it but the uniforms are decidedly fascist red with black trim with brown
[2:26:47.040 --> 2:26:52.720]  khakis this is i mean i was making a science fiction movie about a dystopic nightmare future
[2:26:52.720 --> 2:26:58.560]  with thug you know citizen core enforcers this would be and it's called the core uh so this
[2:26:58.560 --> 2:27:04.560]  is part of americor and it says on their site join the core and their main uh system and now at
[2:27:04.560 --> 2:27:09.280]  first they have pr functions of helping old ladies and school kids but the main function is what ron
[2:27:09.280 --> 2:27:14.080]  manuals said military training three months every summer for the youth junior high high school and
[2:27:14.080 --> 2:27:20.720]  out of school paramilitary training with weapons but don't believe me just just watch that screen here it is
[2:27:30.800 --> 2:27:35.040]  i am changed i've been around since the beginning of time
[2:27:35.040 --> 2:27:43.840]  over the years i've had many faces over the years i've had many looks
[2:27:47.920 --> 2:27:54.400]  but i've always had the same goals to make this world a better place what's it cause
[2:27:56.720 --> 2:28:04.080]  they brought down the berlin wall no behind the berlin wall was citizen cores in tattletell
[2:28:04.080 --> 2:28:11.200]  uniforms spying on the citizens so they they wrapped tyranny and spies and federally controlled
[2:28:11.200 --> 2:28:16.800]  local communities and federalization of police and the the boy scouts training for gun confiscation
[2:28:16.800 --> 2:28:22.800]  i mean insecure core that division i've got the philadelphia news seven years ago under bush
[2:28:22.800 --> 2:28:28.080]  training the high schoolers and middle schoolers for warrants service and fugitive apprehension
[2:28:28.080 --> 2:28:36.320]  quote with m16's so no no no you'd be the people shooting the folks trying to get out of east
[2:28:36.320 --> 2:28:43.200]  germany go back to the video to make this world a better place by helping those who need it most
[2:28:44.480 --> 2:28:50.000]  to never turn my back stop right there our government and and the democratic parties
[2:28:50.000 --> 2:28:55.440]  introduced bills that restrict free speech that continue the free speech zones uh that continue
[2:28:55.440 --> 2:29:00.960]  the cyber bullying act hr 1966 that openly says if you hurt someone's feelings and they sign
[2:29:00.960 --> 2:29:05.920]  an affidavit they will federally charge you under a felony that i mean forget hate crimes laws where
[2:29:05.920 --> 2:29:10.880]  they punish some things more if they claim it was a protected group this is saying that if you do
[2:29:10.880 --> 2:29:15.360]  something on the internet that somebody says hurt their feelings federally charged but then you show
[2:29:15.360 --> 2:29:21.120]  tianeman square where people didn't have free speech that was about free speech at tianeman square
[2:29:21.120 --> 2:29:27.920]  you show that when that's what you are you camouflage yourselves in the color of liberty
[2:29:27.920 --> 2:29:32.400]  in the flag of liberty but then you at the end you say this is my uniform this is what i wear
[2:29:32.960 --> 2:29:40.080]  you guys are sick so this is meant to suck in people who are just ignorant i mean my god this
[2:29:40.080 --> 2:29:45.120]  is tyranny wrapping itself in liberty and we will defeat you we'll ride back with more of this

[2:33:34.000 --> 2:33:39.280]  cancer is actually healthy the public's pointing out all these all these tumors and things popping
[2:33:39.280 --> 2:33:43.680]  out and the country's having trouble breathing and they're saying oh no that's healthy the rest of
[2:33:43.680 --> 2:33:48.720]  the body's what's bad these tumors are the future it's good to have folks running around in
[2:33:48.720 --> 2:33:53.920]  tattletale squads and when you read about this secure core and one of its subgroups to set up by
[2:33:53.920 --> 2:33:58.960]  clinton now expanding city year and david gergen involved in the rest of them is bipartisan
[2:33:59.920 --> 2:34:04.480]  you find out that it is homeland security roles so i'm going to cover all that and
[2:34:04.480 --> 2:34:08.960]  dovetail it into the new world and what life under it will be like in a moment but let's
[2:34:08.960 --> 2:34:37.600]  finish up with that video here it is now that is designed for the most mindless fluoride head
[2:34:37.600 --> 2:34:44.240]  kid totally dumbed down i am changed very simple very stupid and this is what i wear because kids
[2:34:44.240 --> 2:34:48.880]  are all about what they wear and look i know how to zip a zipper you know i'm 14 and normally a
[2:34:48.880 --> 2:34:53.600]  four-year-old could do this but the fluorides got me the point where and and and the mercury shots
[2:34:53.600 --> 2:34:59.600]  and the gmo food where i can zip a zipper zip and i was like who and you know it's real popular with
[2:34:59.600 --> 2:35:06.640]  a drum circle and kind of what's you know cool you know inner city kind of dance but once they
[2:35:06.640 --> 2:35:12.080]  recruit you you find out it is about tattling and spying and going on and demonstrating it's like
[2:35:12.080 --> 2:35:17.600]  egg corn on steroids and they're serving out billions of bucks to these groups both governmental
[2:35:17.600 --> 2:35:23.280]  and non-governmental they're running tv ads with government money for secure core for americorp
[2:35:24.560 --> 2:35:30.080]  but for also completely private groups the democratic party like usaservice.org and then
[2:35:30.080 --> 2:35:34.400]  you're under their control but as the u.s. government seal on it and it's literally they're
[2:35:34.400 --> 2:35:38.800]  out doing gun buyback programs to condition everybody to turn their guns in and to see the
[2:35:38.800 --> 2:35:45.440]  news images of that uh they're busy uh i mean pushing so many facets of this and then i covered
[2:35:45.440 --> 2:35:52.080]  last week the story out of the new york times and perhaps we can pull this article up for folks
[2:35:52.080 --> 2:35:57.920]  if we have time government readies youth corps to take on vets now that's what the first paragraph
[2:35:57.920 --> 2:36:03.760]  of the new york times said that they're training them with these dummy mp5 bb guns and the rest of
[2:36:03.760 --> 2:36:07.920]  it with homeland security all over the nation but that's only one program then they have other
[2:36:07.920 --> 2:36:13.520]  programs in six seventh eighth ninth tenth grade right on up where the public schools and secure
[2:36:13.520 --> 2:36:18.640]  corps do warrant service fugitive apprehension so see it's not good for kids to have guns and
[2:36:18.640 --> 2:36:23.760]  paintball and play or do laser tag or whatever the media says that's evil and bad but if you do it
[2:36:23.760 --> 2:36:30.320]  under the government it's okay that's a sanctioned kosher place to do this so the kids uh run out
[2:36:30.320 --> 2:36:35.040]  and want to be part of this and it's under state control and hitler took the boy scouts that germany
[2:36:35.040 --> 2:36:39.600]  had and militarized it and turned into the hitler eugen and said you're going to spy you're going to
[2:36:39.600 --> 2:36:43.680]  tattle and we have public schools all over the nation's you know riding dossiers and your parents
[2:36:43.680 --> 2:36:50.240]  what's in the medicine cabinet uh they have law enforcement semester starting in the sixth grade
[2:36:50.240 --> 2:36:54.800]  and then they haven't given the eighth and ninth grade where the kids have a federal deputized
[2:36:54.800 --> 2:37:01.600]  deputized local county sheriff or police officer in the class teaching them and and and uh now the
[2:37:01.600 --> 2:37:08.400]  economy is converting over where most the new scholarships and grants aren't for electrical
[2:37:08.400 --> 2:37:16.240]  engineering or arts uh or or botany or biology it is now all about law enforcement it technical
[2:37:16.240 --> 2:37:22.320]  is an itt technical it's now itt law enforcement or security guards this is the new economy they're
[2:37:22.320 --> 2:37:26.800]  converting it over because the big banks own all these private companies supply the police and the
[2:37:26.800 --> 2:37:31.120]  military and lockheed martin puts in the face scanning cameras and the license plate reading
[2:37:31.120 --> 2:37:36.480]  cameras and lockheed martin and others put in the license plate readers and the red light cameras
[2:37:36.480 --> 2:37:41.280]  all of this they're making huge profits all of their converting our economy brain scanners at
[2:37:41.280 --> 2:37:47.200]  the airports biometric scanners that scan your neck and body big defense contractors if you read all
[2:37:47.200 --> 2:37:52.560]  of the country putting cameras in school bathrooms cameras uh in the school lunch rooms cameras in
[2:37:52.560 --> 2:37:58.320]  the classrooms uh you know free federal computers where the kids do their english class stuff on a
[2:37:58.320 --> 2:38:02.720]  federal computer in a laptop they take home but they admit that that's downloaded by the feds to
[2:38:02.720 --> 2:38:09.040]  quote check for plagiarism and because they run it against the database but oh also a data a database
[2:38:09.040 --> 2:38:13.280]  what your kids are and during the law enforcement class it's on a computer that goes to the feds
[2:38:13.280 --> 2:38:18.000]  so now it's actual dossiers being written about your family they admit this in the actual grants
[2:38:18.000 --> 2:38:22.480]  to the schools but to the parents they're told oh your child's being taught how to be a police officer
[2:38:22.480 --> 2:38:26.240]  and you know isn't this great they're going to be like jack bower and then notice almost all the
[2:38:26.240 --> 2:38:33.760]  toys whole aisles at target or toys or us are about kids spies get this be a spy get that be a spy
[2:38:33.760 --> 2:38:40.160]  you watch the kids shows on tv it's all about being spies and spy kids massive total conditioning
[2:38:40.160 --> 2:38:44.880]  everywhere ladies and gentlemen as they convert us to this and then the new york times reports oh
[2:38:44.880 --> 2:38:48.720]  isn't it great the little girls tell their mom not to take a bath they tell their mom not to eat as
[2:38:48.720 --> 2:38:53.520]  much food she's overweight her carbon footprints too big and then parents email me and call me and go
[2:38:53.520 --> 2:38:57.680]  yeah my kid came home and said turn the sink off you're using too much water and our light bulbs
[2:38:57.680 --> 2:39:03.440]  are wrong sounds reasonable reason to have a middle spies of the states to these environmental
[2:39:03.440 --> 2:39:08.320]  parents but then it can quickly be converted over into what does mommy drink what does mommy smoke
[2:39:08.320 --> 2:39:14.960]  what does mommy say what does mommy do and now that's happening so when you see this these guys
[2:39:14.960 --> 2:39:19.040]  are being trained to take on vets trained to take on gun owners trained to take on the american people
[2:39:19.040 --> 2:39:27.200]  and in curtain emos article excellent article uh americorps paramilitary propaganda ad in this story
[2:39:28.000 --> 2:39:34.080]  he details with links to the homeland defense pentagon uh link where they admit this is their
[2:39:34.080 --> 2:39:39.360]  main function is homeland surveillance and intelligence well what did obama say in that
[2:39:39.360 --> 2:39:45.040]  speech in fact pull that up uh it's it's in um the obama deception it's well the film is so important
[2:39:45.760 --> 2:39:52.960]  but uh i just want to go over all this right now if you go to it uh you know he says we needed a
[2:39:52.960 --> 2:39:59.280]  civilian intelligence agency just as big and strong as the military well that's a million strong
[2:39:59.280 --> 2:40:02.880]  and then i got corrected a few weeks ago in the la times the congresswoman said no
[2:40:02.880 --> 2:40:08.240]  we want seven million seven see people think i exaggerated i said one million because he said
[2:40:08.240 --> 2:40:14.400]  that seven million and uh kurt details in this article americorps paramilitary propaganda ad
[2:40:15.200 --> 2:40:21.280]  also the daily newscaster detailed it how this is to work with police departments public safety
[2:40:21.280 --> 2:40:26.320]  grants the war against terrorism on the home front and they give them the training manuals
[2:40:26.320 --> 2:40:30.800]  that say conservatives gun owners people that make frequent references the u.s constitution
[2:40:30.800 --> 2:40:37.440]  they need eyes and ears to do it yeah let's go ahead and play obama what he's saying they
[2:40:37.440 --> 2:40:44.320]  will be used for as they do military drills on tv here it is we cannot continue to rely
[2:40:44.320 --> 2:40:49.360]  only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives that we've said
[2:40:50.080 --> 2:40:55.600]  we've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful just as strong
[2:40:55.600 --> 2:41:02.240]  just as well funded oh yeah that's enough now let me go ahead and get into the other things
[2:41:02.240 --> 2:41:08.960]  that are happening the text of hr1966 the cyber bullying act racing through the house openly
[2:41:08.960 --> 2:41:15.280]  states word for word that if you hurt someone's feelings they sign an affidavit federal felony
[2:41:15.280 --> 2:41:19.440]  five years in prison massive fines you can go read it for yourself okay then they have other
[2:41:19.440 --> 2:41:25.120]  bills introduced this this just came out this sunday broken info wars dot com we have a link to
[2:41:25.120 --> 2:41:37.680]  the no fly no buy act hr2401 where they state openly to everyone that no judge no jury no arrest no
[2:41:37.680 --> 2:41:42.000]  wire on the list just you're not allowed to buy guns and SWAT teams are coming to take them
[2:41:43.440 --> 2:41:48.960]  ladies and gentlemen my dad's been on a no fly list and they say no way to get off you can write
[2:41:48.960 --> 2:41:53.200]  a letter here and do some secret agency we feel like you might get off of it because you know his
[2:41:53.200 --> 2:42:03.200]  name is very common airport secures bars all or does it and he just brought an article about the
[2:42:03.200 --> 2:42:08.640]  body scanners uh i've got other crazy articles about patents for exploding cyanide chips i didn't
[2:42:08.640 --> 2:42:13.200]  get to last week where they want to put exploding cyanide chips in you if you're not good they had
[2:42:13.200 --> 2:42:17.200]  a radio frequency and it kills you this is what governments are pushing you this is not the by
[2:42:17.200 --> 2:42:22.080]  way that's ap and they said oh what's wrong with your cyanide chip you're not with al qaeda i mean
[2:42:22.080 --> 2:42:27.760]  i mean my god you know it was that famous case in 2012 when the al qaeda tried to hit this or that
[2:42:27.760 --> 2:42:32.400]  and because they had exploding cyanide chips it saved the children you're not for killing children
[2:42:32.400 --> 2:42:36.880]  are you then take your son i mean this is the mind remember homeland security saying they want us to
[2:42:36.880 --> 2:42:42.080]  all wear taser bracelets when we get on planes in fact pull that up for folks and then homeland
[2:42:42.080 --> 2:42:47.280]  security came on said yes we're looking at making you wear taser bracelets right out of the running
[2:42:47.280 --> 2:42:53.680]  man next it's an exploding necklace around your neck i mean folks it's so over the top the public
[2:42:53.680 --> 2:42:59.360]  doesn't they've introduced bills look at this one bill in congress would ban gun ownership at will
[2:42:59.360 --> 2:43:04.480]  i'm going to cover that next but first erin dykes did more research this weekend you'll do a blurb
[2:43:04.480 --> 2:43:09.360]  about this he tends to do the research and so busy never gets the articles david gurgin it's
[2:43:09.360 --> 2:43:15.280]  bipartisan big republicans trilateral commission is involved with this uh city year division of
[2:43:15.280 --> 2:43:19.920]  secure corps they hand out private grants of the fat cats make the money but it's under federal
[2:43:19.920 --> 2:43:25.440]  control this is the new fascistic model they call socialism they mix in their their their recruitment
[2:43:25.440 --> 2:43:30.640]  that he has with mahatma gandhi who would fight against that not not squads of tattletales and
[2:43:30.640 --> 2:43:36.640]  government uniforms uh and so you're here to give us the inside scoop on this one division
[2:43:37.920 --> 2:43:42.720]  uh you know they've got at least 10 divisions of these people they're gonna have the elderly you
[2:43:42.720 --> 2:43:48.720]  know the senior corps the environment corps the green corps the security corps that's what this is
[2:43:48.720 --> 2:43:54.320]  it just goes on and on the infrastructure corps that's in for guard with the 56 000 executives
[2:43:54.320 --> 2:44:01.120]  with license to kill their employees during during emergencies 007 power i mean preachers uh you know
[2:44:01.120 --> 2:44:07.040]  the uh clergy response team corps and it's all bipartisan so uh erin dykes let us uh
[2:44:08.000 --> 2:44:12.640]  break down the research you've done just on this one division yeah i mean it's just amazing i think
[2:44:12.640 --> 2:44:17.840]  you probably remember around the time obama deception was coming out a lot of people were like oh is
[2:44:17.840 --> 2:44:23.040]  there really going to be some civilian national force service and then it was all announced by
[2:44:23.040 --> 2:44:27.520]  the white house and all announced by the last two white houses and then they just people still live
[2:44:27.520 --> 2:44:32.720]  in denial yeah people try to deny it and then rama manual has a book on it he's on tv gave
[2:44:32.720 --> 2:44:39.360]  like 20 speeches turns c span everywhere yeah it turns out brzezinski wrote about it in his book
[2:44:39.360 --> 2:44:47.680]  and now david gergen back in 2007 helped launch uh america forward which is a collective of all
[2:44:47.680 --> 2:44:55.840]  these organizations including uh city year and also uh teachers there's literally some 60 plus
[2:44:55.840 --> 2:45:01.120]  organizations uh and he's just launched all of them and by the way if you next to sit in last
[2:45:01.120 --> 2:45:06.400]  week 50 plus top academics and ngos came out and called for world government it it's all the same
[2:45:06.400 --> 2:45:11.120]  groups and they all get government money to come in and take over your cities and counties
[2:45:11.120 --> 2:45:15.200]  we had that british guy on about a month ago about the group over there doing the same thing
[2:45:15.200 --> 2:45:19.680]  this is how they're taken over and then they tell all the other churches join us will give you federal
[2:45:19.680 --> 2:45:24.400]  money to put out our propaganda but if you don't join us we're going to come and arrest you for
[2:45:24.400 --> 2:45:30.080]  tax evasion i mean this is tyranny man this is happening yeah and you know who would figure
[2:45:30.080 --> 2:45:35.440]  the presidential advisor to what four or five presidents in a row uh is behind you know he's
[2:45:35.440 --> 2:45:41.200]  on the board for city year and all these other organizations here's the list of all the organizations
[2:45:41.200 --> 2:45:46.800]  he started it's literally this is the longer list this is the shorter list colin pal started one
[2:45:46.800 --> 2:45:52.480]  of these organizations this is how they're going to rule every city every county has its government
[2:45:52.480 --> 2:45:57.920]  funded federally internationally funded ngo they only have standing at the uner congress
[2:45:58.800 --> 2:46:03.040]  and they've got unlimited capital they're moving against us and you're right listen you can go to
[2:46:03.040 --> 2:46:07.200]  an event and protest the north american union or the spp taking over the highways which they claim
[2:46:07.200 --> 2:46:10.400]  we've beat but they're still going ahead with it and these people will walk up to you and start bumping
[2:46:10.400 --> 2:46:16.480]  you and start getting in your face and and laughing that imagine being scum for just a 20 bucks an hour
[2:46:16.480 --> 2:46:21.600]  15 bucks an hour who goes out and goes and tries to destroy freedom it's terrible and that's the
[2:46:21.600 --> 2:46:25.840]  other sick part they call it national compulsory service they're gonna make school kids and and
[2:46:25.840 --> 2:46:30.640]  graduates do this but they say oh it's not slavery because we pay you well they pay you when they
[2:46:30.640 --> 2:46:36.160]  draft you in the army yeah that's actually what gergen says he said that's also paid volunteerism
[2:46:36.160 --> 2:46:42.400]  what's wrong with paid volunteerism it's not volunteer they they they they they they've had acts
[2:46:42.400 --> 2:46:48.480]  called the national compulsory service act volunteerism isn't compulsory yeah and it's true
[2:46:48.480 --> 2:46:53.680]  it's under homeland security americorps and all of them are under homeland security under a branch
[2:46:53.680 --> 2:46:58.320]  i think it's called center for national service or something like that and they state their main
[2:46:58.320 --> 2:47:03.840]  job is tackling these people are absolute cancer to america and i don't just say that
[2:47:03.840 --> 2:47:09.040]  the this is literal literal filth they don't put up with this in eastern europe anymore
[2:47:09.040 --> 2:47:12.480]  those people ran them out they don't put up with this in china that people don't like it
[2:47:12.480 --> 2:47:18.320]  they don't put up with this anywhere folks this is the dirtiest filthiest crap there is erin
[2:47:18.320 --> 2:47:22.240]  can you believe this is happening in america it's hard to believe i you know i didn't know
[2:47:22.240 --> 2:47:26.960]  about all the stuff at first and then you know there's stuff like uh the department of defense
[2:47:26.960 --> 2:47:34.320]  1404 as soon as obama started they do have national security forces over in foreign countries holding
[2:47:34.320 --> 2:47:38.640]  weapons and it says they will operate here domestically under north com and it says it'll be a
[2:47:38.640 --> 2:47:43.840]  multi hundred thousand man army and in the marines announced look at this i this just came in friday
[2:47:43.840 --> 2:47:50.080]  i can't even cover all of this look at this look at this this is a new they're gonna have their new
[2:47:50.080 --> 2:47:54.640]  domestic municipal forces that operate in and around the military bases and off the bases
[2:47:54.640 --> 2:47:59.760]  and they have regular marines running checkpoint searching u.s citizens and then look at these cops
[2:47:59.760 --> 2:48:06.000]  a national police force under the marines to operate off base oh hi i'm the marine and these
[2:48:06.000 --> 2:48:11.840]  guys are trained folks that's why uh we just had a we are changer i know real well call here his
[2:48:11.840 --> 2:48:16.560]  sister lives in austin they pulled him over they were making the guy drive into a sobriety check
[2:48:16.560 --> 2:48:21.920]  they hadn't been drinking by the way and uh she she starts calling her brother nate evans the cop
[2:48:21.920 --> 2:48:25.840]  walks over and says get off your phone she says i'm allowed to be on the phone slams her face and
[2:48:25.840 --> 2:48:29.600]  splits her whole head open she's lucky they didn't gun her down in the back and then say
[2:48:29.600 --> 2:48:33.520]  she shouldn't have been out at night because you know i heard people on news radio 59 he
[2:48:33.520 --> 2:48:37.440]  called her to the day when the cops shot these two guys saying good if you're out at night you
[2:48:37.440 --> 2:48:43.680]  deserve to die this is the level of groveling to the police now we're yes kill anyone out at night
[2:48:43.680 --> 2:48:50.000]  kill us kill us you know i mean my god man oh you're just a cop basher yeah you know
[2:48:50.000 --> 2:48:56.960]  you know this it's my god folks what i think they're gonna phase this stuff all in with 50
[2:48:56.960 --> 2:49:02.320]  different heads there's gonna be a kickstart a head start teachers for service uh all these
[2:49:02.320 --> 2:49:06.480]  different organizations all drawing paychecks with our tax money while we all just i mean
[2:49:06.480 --> 2:49:12.640]  government is bush triple the size of government obama in the first two months doubled the tripling
[2:49:12.640 --> 2:49:17.120]  it's all over they're tickly they're like roaches it's like if you turn your light on at night in
[2:49:17.120 --> 2:49:21.280]  the kitchen there were eight million roaches just piles of them and they're looking at you saying
[2:49:21.280 --> 2:49:26.080]  you're bad get out of our house and i guess it's true they are the roaches they run everything
[2:49:26.080 --> 2:49:32.240]  and and that's the end of it it's terrible yeah david gurgans writing since 2006 about how to get
[2:49:32.240 --> 2:49:37.040]  government to fund more of these national service groups he saw that obama was coming anew this
[2:49:37.040 --> 2:49:40.960]  thing was going to be ram forward i'm sure for a lot of other reasons and then meanwhile they've
[2:49:40.960 --> 2:49:45.600]  introduced three bills where the any designated the federal government can put you on a list you
[2:49:45.600 --> 2:49:49.520]  can't find out why you're on a list no more second amendment than they come and take your guns
[2:49:49.520 --> 2:49:53.840]  you get hit by a swat team too bad if they kill you the locals will get on the news and say
[2:49:53.840 --> 2:49:59.840]  he deserved it you know i mean and these guys old in iraq confiscating guns and kicking indoors
[2:49:59.840 --> 2:50:04.960]  all day they show up here you wonder how people fell to the nazis and stuff in the in the communists
[2:50:04.960 --> 2:50:10.160]  because the people go along with orders man they rationalize that it's good but it's going to get
[2:50:10.160 --> 2:50:14.800]  so bad that all of you are going to lose in the end and your family name is going to be destroyed
[2:50:14.800 --> 2:50:18.880]  a lot of you cops and military are going to go to prison because we're going to beat you in the end
[2:50:18.880 --> 2:50:23.120]  i just want i probably won't be here after all this airing but when we finally take america back
[2:50:23.120 --> 2:50:27.520]  and take the world back i do want to make sure we hunt all these people down and give them a
[2:50:27.520 --> 2:50:32.640]  proper trial with their juries but everybody that commits treason i really think they need the death
[2:50:32.640 --> 2:50:37.920]  penalty i'm sorry i'd really think that they need to at least be given life in prison you know all
[2:50:37.920 --> 2:50:42.640]  these prisons full of pot smokers will fill it full of government bureaucrats and cops broke the law
[2:50:42.640 --> 2:50:47.760]  now you think you're invincible now you think you've won you think you've destroyed the country and
[2:50:47.760 --> 2:50:54.720]  you've had the victory no you haven't right here bill in congress would ban gun ownership at will
[2:50:54.720 --> 2:50:59.920]  now i know a lot of cops are good do you stand with this they got bills to ban free speech it's

[3:08:02.000 --> 3:08:08.720]  communications radio network proudly presents the alex jones show because there's a war on for your
[3:08:08.720 --> 3:08:16.400]  mind you know i saw an article quoting richard stallman about attacks on the internet and
[3:08:16.400 --> 3:08:22.720]  its infrastructure and free speech i told my producer game on and when the two it guys here
[3:08:22.720 --> 3:08:28.160]  at the office found about it they were very giddy today because this guy is quite a big wig and the
[3:08:28.160 --> 3:08:37.040]  architecture of browsers the internet you name it richard stallman gnu linux inventor
[3:08:37.040 --> 3:08:45.520]  richard matthew stallman often abbreviated rms is an american software freedom activist hacker
[3:08:45.520 --> 3:08:50.880]  and software developer in september 83 he launched the gnu project to create a free
[3:08:50.880 --> 3:08:55.280]  unix like operating system and has been the project's lead architect and organizer with
[3:08:55.280 --> 3:09:01.440]  the launch of the gnu project he started the free software movement in october 1985 set up the free
[3:09:01.440 --> 3:09:06.320]  software foundation you know if i go over his whole bio will never get to him but this is one
[3:09:06.320 --> 3:09:10.640]  of the you know i know they say all gore invented the internet even though it was around you know
[3:09:10.640 --> 3:09:15.280]  30 years ago and i know they say he probably invented the moon actually and and the galaxy
[3:09:15.280 --> 3:09:18.800]  but uh you know you know we talk about some of the folks who have actually really contributed
[3:09:18.800 --> 3:09:24.160]  to the infrastructure of of the free web as we know it uh this guy's certainly an icon and what
[3:09:24.160 --> 3:09:28.000]  we know as the modern uh web richard stallman i want to get him on because they're trying to
[3:09:28.000 --> 3:09:32.240]  create a net neutrality they're trying to change how the web works the head of cyber security
[3:09:32.240 --> 3:09:36.560]  quit two months ago we talked to him he says you're not ready to come on the air right now
[3:09:36.560 --> 3:09:40.960]  he's behind the scene stuff but he said the feds are taking it over the pentagon's taking over the
[3:09:40.960 --> 3:09:46.000]  web and then it came out in the news that they are taking over the actual hubs of even smaller
[3:09:48.400 --> 3:09:54.960]  you know uh internet telecom systems so to try to break all this down with us is richard stallman
[3:09:54.960 --> 3:09:59.840]  richard so much is going on and i'd you know we've got you for the about 45 minutes or so
[3:09:59.840 --> 3:10:05.200]  um it's great to have you here with us well i'm pleased to have a chance again
[3:10:05.840 --> 3:10:09.760]  you bet uh okay uh you've got the floor what do you think's most important i mean you've
[3:10:09.760 --> 3:10:14.880]  dedicated your you know entire professional career to liberty and freedom on this wonderful
[3:10:14.880 --> 3:10:21.040]  thing we call the internet uh how did it start where are we going well first i have to correct
[3:10:21.040 --> 3:10:27.120]  a couple of things i've never worked on web browsers myself i'm happy to say that there
[3:10:27.120 --> 3:10:33.120]  are some free freedom respecting web browsers but i didn't write any of them now what i meant
[3:10:33.120 --> 3:10:37.440]  was just setting up an infrastructure but i mean that the the the the group they have here that
[3:10:37.440 --> 3:10:42.720]  you set up is involved in a whole bunch of stuff's my point but go ahead yes we developed first of all
[3:10:42.720 --> 3:10:50.400]  the new operating system which gets used together with linux the kernel and that's the main freedom
[3:10:50.400 --> 3:10:56.400]  respecting operating system that lets you use your computer without handing over control
[3:10:56.400 --> 3:11:05.440]  to some company now we know that microsoft windows has a backdoor that allows microsoft
[3:11:05.440 --> 3:11:12.640]  to forcibly impose changes in software without asking permission of the supposed owner of the
[3:11:12.640 --> 3:11:20.080]  machine and we know that mac os has a similar backdoor except that it's apple that can forcibly
[3:11:20.080 --> 3:11:25.360]  impose changes they can change anything they want in the software which means they can
[3:11:25.360 --> 3:11:32.560]  wipe the floor with whoever is using that machine so in effect these two systems have
[3:11:32.560 --> 3:11:39.760]  no security at all against that particular company and then we see us senators coming out
[3:11:39.760 --> 3:11:44.800]  of a real-life example of this saying oh we'll just make it where if we think you downloaded
[3:11:44.800 --> 3:11:50.640]  music illegally or videos no court no jury we'll just quote fry your computer that's where all
[3:11:50.640 --> 3:11:54.960]  this remote access comes in and there's so many things we could talk about but i mean
[3:11:54.960 --> 3:12:01.360]  please continue with uh because i've seen them now trying to move towards making it where everything
[3:12:01.360 --> 3:12:06.800]  you have is on a remote server your computers you know are no longer even really uh operable
[3:12:06.800 --> 3:12:14.080]  by themselves they just become terminals please continue well these are both part of the desire
[3:12:14.080 --> 3:12:21.520]  to regain control over what we do with our computers and with the internet and these
[3:12:21.520 --> 3:12:31.120]  are not the only ways of course they're bad uh in fact a pc today any pc today is pretty powerful
[3:12:31.120 --> 3:12:37.280]  compared with the machines that people were using 10 years ago and the disks that they're making today
[3:12:37.280 --> 3:12:44.240]  are so big why would you ever feel you need to store your data someplace other than in your own
[3:12:44.240 --> 3:12:51.440]  computer or your own your own office or your own bedroom uh if you can't even get the disks
[3:12:51.440 --> 3:12:57.200]  nowadays that i used to think were very big 10 years ago now they don't make anything that small
[3:12:57.920 --> 3:13:05.120]  so we should resist this tendency and i think it's a sort of marketing hype
[3:13:06.160 --> 3:13:13.760]  uh phenomenon and buzzwords are being invented including the term cloud computing which is so
[3:13:13.760 --> 3:13:20.960]  nebulous that nobody can really tell what it means it means a different thing depending on who's
[3:13:20.960 --> 3:13:27.440]  using it so it's not really a coherent thing to talk about and so i won't say anything about it
[3:13:27.440 --> 3:13:35.200]  but uh storing some data on servers is not necessarily a bad thing when it's part of a
[3:13:35.200 --> 3:13:41.920]  when you're publishing it when it's for instance something you want to put on a web server so
[3:13:41.920 --> 3:13:48.000]  everybody can see it well there's no great harm that's possible they are the worst that anyone
[3:13:48.000 --> 3:13:55.680]  could do to it is delete it and turn it off uh and you'd know that of course uh mainly that's
[3:13:55.680 --> 3:14:00.080]  likely to happen if somebody with power is mistreating you but they can always do that
[3:14:00.640 --> 3:14:06.160]  so the point is there's no particular harm from if you want to publish something from putting it
[3:14:06.160 --> 3:14:13.680]  on some server somewhere but when you don't want to publish it then the only way to keep it privately
[3:14:13.680 --> 3:14:21.920]  is to keep it in in your disk well and to use your copy of free software to do your computing
[3:14:21.920 --> 3:14:26.560]  well mr stolman you know we can kind of get into the detailed minutiae this and i want to do that
[3:14:26.560 --> 3:14:31.600]  in limited time we have we today and we respect your time uh how about the big picture of what the
[3:14:31.600 --> 3:14:37.120]  infrastructure the architecture of the web has been what the establishment and uh you know is
[3:14:37.120 --> 3:14:42.560]  fighting to change it over to where they have control versus what you uh you know somebody
[3:14:42.560 --> 3:14:48.480]  who's really fought for you know true freedom on the internet uh should be well we see a lot
[3:14:48.480 --> 3:14:54.560]  of ways in which people are trying to take more control software as a service is one of these
[3:14:54.560 --> 3:15:01.840]  ways in order for you to have control of your computing you've got to do it with your copy
[3:15:01.840 --> 3:15:08.320]  of a free program if the program you use isn't free freedom respecting that is that means the
[3:15:08.320 --> 3:15:13.680]  developer controls it and the users don't so that way you've lost control over your computing
[3:15:14.400 --> 3:15:20.960]  but if you're doing your computing in somebody else's server you've also lost control because
[3:15:20.960 --> 3:15:27.440]  that means you're using his copy of the program whatever program it is not your copy so he has
[3:15:27.440 --> 3:15:33.520]  control over it and you don't so the way the way to prevent that from happening to you is
[3:15:33.520 --> 3:15:40.640]  insist on doing your computing in your computer with your copy of a free program well here's an
[3:15:40.640 --> 3:15:48.880]  example i was uh talking to an it person for the biggest grocery chain in the nation they have
[3:15:48.880 --> 3:15:53.920]  i think 25 different uh chains under them uh he didn't want me to say the name but he listed
[3:15:53.920 --> 3:15:59.360]  and sent me documents of the german company and then i searched and you did and found the german
[3:15:59.360 --> 3:16:05.840]  the german company that's running more than half of the supermarket supply chain systems and warehouse
[3:16:05.840 --> 3:16:11.280]  chain systems for the food and it's all based in germany they make you go through their software
[3:16:11.280 --> 3:16:16.080]  through the internet and through satellites and it breaks down every week or so for just a few
[3:16:16.080 --> 3:16:20.160]  hours and everything comes to a standstill and then he was telling me about and i was reading
[3:16:20.160 --> 3:16:24.800]  about gas stations that's why they're always shut down and mcdonald suddenly you can't use credit
[3:16:24.800 --> 3:16:30.240]  cards half the time when you're there because it's the softwares that are controlled by a company
[3:16:30.240 --> 3:16:35.120]  and it lets the other companies just have a window into these other big mega corporations realize
[3:16:35.120 --> 3:16:41.760]  the amount of power they're turning over i guess they don't you see on they're not used to thinking
[3:16:41.760 --> 3:16:47.120]  in terms of maintaining control over their own computing now this is a paradoxical case because
[3:16:47.120 --> 3:16:54.400]  some you know big companies just by being big have power that's dangerous to democracy but
[3:16:55.520 --> 3:17:00.640]  suppose the business isn't so big well then it's not dangerous and the point is the business is
[3:17:00.640 --> 3:17:06.560]  probably going to use computers and it deserves to have control over its own computing just as you
[3:17:06.560 --> 3:17:13.920]  and i do and so they're vulnerable to this but the the propaganda of business says
[3:17:13.920 --> 3:17:20.560]  is just think of short-term profit don't think of anybody's long-term interest not even your own
[3:17:21.600 --> 3:17:26.720]  so this is why it's so common that if you let a corporation own some kind of
[3:17:27.680 --> 3:17:35.040]  uh permanent useful thing the corporation will strip it because it's looking for short-term profit
[3:17:35.040 --> 3:17:41.120]  that's one of the problems of our economic system that we are have wedged ourselves into
[3:17:41.120 --> 3:17:45.360]  that's what they're doing now with the automakers they're forcing them to so often pieces
[3:17:45.360 --> 3:17:51.280]  and and and i literally strip mine it what about net neutrality and how they're seeing with internet
[3:17:51.280 --> 3:17:58.960]  too you'll have a subdomain like on a myspacer youtube and that then they're going to try internet
[3:17:58.960 --> 3:18:04.560]  to you know claims their own documents phase out individual urls or kind of have that being the
[3:18:04.560 --> 3:18:11.360]  old internet and not upgrade the uh hubs for that but then basically push everybody into the new
[3:18:11.360 --> 3:18:18.160]  system that the new york time set a month ago has less freedom but is quote safer i don't know about
[3:18:18.160 --> 3:18:24.320]  this uh but i know a lot of people will fight it for instance the free software foundation is not
[3:18:24.320 --> 3:18:31.840]  going to start posting it stuff through somebody else's server we run our own servers and i hope
[3:18:31.840 --> 3:18:40.080]  that the other people will continue to do so so basically the more we build the original real
[3:18:40.080 --> 3:18:45.680]  true web so it's it's really a battle of architecture then and then we choose just like
[3:18:45.680 --> 3:18:50.000]  you would choose to buy organic food to then build that market so you have more choices
[3:18:50.000 --> 3:18:56.400]  we choose uh to use the uh open uh license software and things well i of course i'm not in
[3:18:56.400 --> 3:19:02.160]  favor of making software open i speak of free software because it's freedom respecting sure
[3:19:02.160 --> 3:19:06.320]  there are other people who are basically the people who like this software but they don't
[3:19:06.320 --> 3:19:13.200]  want to talk about freedom they coined another term which is quote open source unquote which
[3:19:13.200 --> 3:19:17.760]  is a way they can promote their views where they don't want to talk about that issue so it's all
[3:19:17.760 --> 3:19:24.480]  a semantical fight well thank you for educating me by explaining back to the point that you raised
[3:19:24.480 --> 3:19:35.040]  yes we can choose by what we do or whether to use these massive uh corporate invite everybody to
[3:19:36.160 --> 3:19:43.360]  to put their data into these mega servers or we can choose otherwise but we have to organize
[3:19:43.360 --> 3:19:51.280]  politically too we can't expect individual choice in market mechanisms to always protect our freedom
[3:19:51.280 --> 3:19:56.000]  we have to organize to protect our freedom we have to do it intentionally all right stay there sir
[3:19:56.000 --> 3:20:00.960]  amazing information can't wait to get into some other topics with you and talk about uh the organization

[3:24:55.200 --> 3:25:01.600]  support as a business for free software and other useful things and you could also join the free
[3:25:01.600 --> 3:25:08.080]  software foundation which is the main way that we pay our staff now i'm a volunteer but the staff
[3:25:08.080 --> 3:25:12.400]  get paid sure folks should definitely join that because we probably wouldn't have as much freedom
[3:25:12.400 --> 3:25:17.360]  as we have now but wouldn't for you guys you know again i'm no it guy i can barely send an email
[3:25:18.400 --> 3:25:23.840]  but just because i do at least a lot of servers and cds and own some i know some about it
[3:25:23.840 --> 3:25:30.240]  and and always talking to it people you know they talk about how the free software that uh you're
[3:25:30.240 --> 3:25:35.440]  discussing and they semantically call it open source to try to you know take away the branding
[3:25:35.440 --> 3:25:41.280]  and semantically control it is a lot harder to break into a lot harder for people to control it works
[3:25:41.280 --> 3:25:47.360]  a lot better because microsoft and everybody else they want everything set up so they can backdoor
[3:25:47.360 --> 3:25:52.640]  it they can control it that also leaves the doors open to other bad guys doesn't it well sometimes
[3:25:52.640 --> 3:25:59.680]  it does and sometimes it doesn't but because i won't claim that every non-free program is
[3:25:59.680 --> 3:26:05.120]  badly written you know those people are not all stupid some of them are very capable it's just
[3:26:05.120 --> 3:26:13.280]  that they don't respect your freedom so uh it's true however quite often they have very bad security
[3:26:13.280 --> 3:26:23.040]  even against third parties for instance with cell phones there are viruses that uh can get into cell
[3:26:23.040 --> 3:26:32.560]  phones so they can then invoke the cell phones ability to turn on as a listening device without
[3:26:32.560 --> 3:26:39.360]  ringing without showing any sign that it's making a call it's still listening to the sound that comes
[3:26:39.360 --> 3:26:45.440]  in to the microphone like whatever conversation you're having with people and sending that to whoever
[3:26:47.280 --> 3:26:55.200]  but you may be safer if you use a cell phone that's all free software and there are some
[3:26:55.920 --> 3:27:01.760]  there is the open moco phone i don't know how well that's working yet and i think if you get the
[3:27:01.760 --> 3:27:08.080]  professional version of the google phone then that's really free software although i'm not
[3:27:08.080 --> 3:27:14.320]  sure all of it is free software amazing uh long segment coming up this one's short but another
[3:27:14.320 --> 3:27:19.680]  question um and again all these it people and hackers send me this stuff and it's mainline
[3:27:19.680 --> 3:27:25.360]  pentagon reports and an air force cyber command san Antonio and it's it's the general commanding
[3:27:25.360 --> 3:27:31.600]  air forces to attack our own internet to test its strengths and weaknesses and then i've seen
[3:27:31.600 --> 3:27:35.520]  hackers have told me and i've seen some blurbs about how it's really the government hacking
[3:27:35.520 --> 3:27:41.520]  the hospitals and hacking power plants to then have a pretext to bring in more of their own
[3:27:41.520 --> 3:27:47.360]  control are you familiar with government's false flagging or staging attacks on their own systems
[3:27:47.360 --> 3:27:54.720]  as a pretext to get more funding and control well uh i i don't know about any instances of that
[3:27:55.280 --> 3:28:02.160]  on the internet uh that's not what i specialize in so i haven't read about i haven't read news
[3:28:02.160 --> 3:28:09.120]  about a thing like that that i recall but it wouldn't surprise me that much i mean if you
[3:28:09.120 --> 3:28:16.640]  could have the gulf of tankin incident and uh you could have the supposed weapons of mass
[3:28:16.640 --> 3:28:25.440]  destruction in iraq then i guess uh why wouldn't they lie about who is uh you know that i wouldn't
[3:28:25.440 --> 3:28:31.120]  put it past them to uh stage such an attack and lie about it but that doesn't mean i that i know
[3:28:31.120 --> 3:28:35.360]  that they're doing so sure that you know that really wasn't in the news i mean there were a few
[3:28:35.360 --> 3:28:40.880]  stories it was it's mainly bizarre hour long video briefings with the air force and people
[3:28:41.440 --> 3:28:45.680]  and i'm uh i mean i'm sure you did hear about the head of cyber security a couple months ago
[3:28:45.680 --> 3:28:50.080]  quit and said the feds are taking over the web i won't be part of this i mean when their own
[3:28:50.080 --> 3:28:56.080]  head of cyber security quits well i think we have a big problem here yeah i didn't read about that
[3:28:56.080 --> 3:29:01.200]  and now that i've heard from you i'll take a look now there's so much going on i i can't
[3:29:01.200 --> 3:29:06.160]  keep track of it all either and it was only in a few articles uh when we come back i want to
[3:29:06.160 --> 3:29:10.720]  talk about how do we save the internet how do we expand it how do we make it more free
[3:29:10.720 --> 3:29:15.120]  versus the architecture that it seems to be leaning towards uh go ahead and start down those lines
[3:29:15.120 --> 3:29:23.040]  sir well my work will help you make sure that your computer is under your control but beyond
[3:29:23.040 --> 3:29:31.520]  that there's nothing that each one of us can directly do so if there's censorship or if there
[3:29:31.520 --> 3:29:41.840]  is a surveillance going on uh in the internet that connects you to me neither you nor i can
[3:29:41.840 --> 3:29:48.160]  simply make a change to turn that off the only way i know if we could stop that well stay there
[3:29:48.160 --> 3:29:54.000]  gotta break i'm sorry to interrupt gotta break for the satellite we're on the march the empires
[3:29:54.000 --> 3:29:58.400]  on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[3:32:07.200 --> 3:32:11.760]  superfood for garden plants flowers and herbs it's called proto grow and it's so effective at producing
[3:32:11.760 --> 3:32:16.000]  rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically

[3:32:20.720 --> 3:32:25.360]  proto grows unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases
[3:32:25.360 --> 3:32:30.320]  bloom set creating maximum plant growth in minimum time proto grow works by providing geometric keys
[3:32:30.320 --> 3:32:34.160]  which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants
[3:32:34.160 --> 3:32:37.920]  proto grows full spectrum plant fertility needs fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste
[3:32:37.920 --> 3:32:42.080]  and up to 10 times the nutritional value and if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs
[3:32:42.080 --> 3:32:46.320]  or wheatgrass you can if you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids it's

[3:35:14.720 --> 3:35:22.400]  Stallman who invented the GNU Linux system has a big free software internet freedom organization
[3:35:22.400 --> 3:35:27.440]  again sir I'm literally a troglodyte when it comes to all these terms again reintroduce yourself
[3:35:27.440 --> 3:35:31.920]  for folks that don't know that I'm just going to sit back shut up and hear what your solutions are
[3:35:31.920 --> 3:35:37.440]  ways to fight this you got cut off by the break with how do we stop the government governments
[3:35:38.000 --> 3:35:42.800]  from trashing the web they openly say the people are kicking their butt they don't like free speech
[3:35:42.800 --> 3:35:48.480]  I get restricted everywhere by MySpace YouTube they admit I'm censored I'm just little old Alex
[3:35:48.480 --> 3:35:56.720]  Jones you got the floor sir well when I started 25 years ago was developing a free software
[3:35:56.720 --> 3:36:02.960]  operating system called GNU the idea is free software is software that respects your freedom
[3:36:02.960 --> 3:36:09.360]  and you control it the users control it individually if they know how and want to go to the trouble
[3:36:09.360 --> 3:36:16.240]  but also the users collectively control it any group of users that want the program to work a
[3:36:16.240 --> 3:36:22.080]  certain way they're free to develop their version which works that way those who know how to program
[3:36:22.080 --> 3:36:28.640]  do it and those who have the same preferences use that version and if they don't like that version
[3:36:28.640 --> 3:36:35.200]  they use some other version and you can also pay people to make the changes you want so for
[3:36:35.200 --> 3:36:40.640]  instance your show if you wanted to change a free program well you personally don't know how
[3:36:40.640 --> 3:36:45.280]  maybe none of your staff knows how but there are companies that would make those changes
[3:36:45.280 --> 3:36:51.280]  just as there are carpenters you could hire to make changes in your office and they'll just do
[3:36:51.280 --> 3:36:57.360]  the work the way you want it done and if you want to change it again some other day you can hire
[3:36:57.360 --> 3:37:03.680]  somebody else because nobody has a monopoly it's a free market this business of support for free
[3:37:03.680 --> 3:37:08.640]  software and does that allow a kind of evolution it seems like where where where the non-free
[3:37:08.640 --> 3:37:14.720]  softwares are stagnant except for minor changes this accelerates development doesn't it well
[3:37:14.720 --> 3:37:20.640]  it it may or may not I won't claim that all non-free programs are stagnant that depends how
[3:37:20.640 --> 3:37:26.560]  much work that the developer is putting in but regardless of whether it makes fast progress
[3:37:26.560 --> 3:37:32.640]  or slow progress it makes progress in the direction that the developer wants and if there's something
[3:37:32.640 --> 3:37:39.760]  the developer doesn't want you to be able to do like for instance access a certain file more than
[3:37:39.760 --> 3:37:47.760]  five times uh heal program it not to let you so proprietary programs frequently have these
[3:37:47.760 --> 3:37:55.280]  malicious features which we call digital restrictions management or drm or digital handcuffs they are
[3:37:55.280 --> 3:38:02.080]  designed to stop you from doing things so that program may not be your servant it may be your
[3:38:02.080 --> 3:38:10.400]  prison guard in any case these are things that we can take control of ourselves we can free
[3:38:10.400 --> 3:38:14.960]  ourselves in each other and that's what we've been doing in the free software movement since I
[3:38:14.960 --> 3:38:22.640]  started it but there are other areas where we just can't solve the problem that way uh surveillance
[3:38:23.280 --> 3:38:29.840]  in the internet service provider we can't stop that by uh what by choosing to use a different
[3:38:29.840 --> 3:38:34.880]  program in our own computers because it's not happening in our computers it's happening
[3:38:34.880 --> 3:38:41.040]  in some central office now one thing that helps somewhat is to use programs like the
[3:38:41.040 --> 3:38:48.960]  gnu privacy guard for encryption of our of our of the messages and files we send each other but
[3:38:48.960 --> 3:38:54.880]  even that even encryption doesn't do the whole job and when there is censorship you know in
[3:38:54.880 --> 3:39:01.840]  australia the main organization that fights for civil liberties on the internet which is
[3:39:01.840 --> 3:39:08.960]  electronic frontiers australia was forced to take down a link that they had put up in a
[3:39:08.960 --> 3:39:16.080]  discussion of censorship showing what kinds of things are getting censored well they were
[3:39:16.080 --> 3:39:22.320]  forced to take down that link on the threat of being fined eleven thousand dollars a day
[3:39:22.320 --> 3:39:25.920]  yeah let me back you up on that they've announced the government itself calls it
[3:39:25.920 --> 3:39:30.880]  chinese style net censorship and proudly are now issuing hundreds and hundreds of sites
[3:39:30.880 --> 3:39:35.680]  they're now saying thousands on these lists that you can't visit you can't link to you and then you
[3:39:35.680 --> 3:39:42.560]  can't link and say look uh wiki leaks leaking government documents you can't even say that's
[3:39:42.560 --> 3:39:50.960]  been censored that's very 1984 kafka s yeah well the australian government has been trashing human
[3:39:50.960 --> 3:39:58.640]  rights for many years typically in the name of preventing terrorism as many other governments
[3:39:58.640 --> 3:40:06.000]  are doing you know uh any given week their excuse is either terrorists or pedophiles
[3:40:06.640 --> 3:40:12.400]  but neither of them is anywhere near as dangerous as governments that don't respect our freedom
[3:40:13.600 --> 3:40:18.080]  absolutely historically governments killed 200 something million people last century i mean
[3:40:18.880 --> 3:40:26.720]  tyranny is is you know has gotten a whole new lease on life uh so specifically what do we do
[3:40:26.720 --> 3:40:33.600]  i mean if citizens and companies try to go with free software solutions and and support groups like
[3:40:33.600 --> 3:40:39.760]  yours uh what else can we do i mean i guess we vote with our dollars we vote with our time i mean
[3:40:39.760 --> 3:40:45.520]  what i mean let's say i'm a company with twenty something yeah for centralized surveillance and
[3:40:45.520 --> 3:40:51.600]  censorship you they don't let you vote with your time or with your dollars you know if you're in
[3:40:51.600 --> 3:40:57.520]  australia and you want to make links to these forbidden sites for instance the political
[3:40:57.520 --> 3:41:03.680]  sites to talk about australian censorship but you can't do that by picking one company over
[3:41:03.680 --> 3:41:08.800]  another you'd have to put your site outside australia and then maybe australia wouldn't
[3:41:08.800 --> 3:41:13.600]  let anybody link to your site yeah that's the key that's what australia senator do is block
[3:41:13.600 --> 3:41:17.920]  most of the web but i mean that's the key is that that's what homeland security is announced
[3:41:17.920 --> 3:41:21.760]  that they're going to take over all the infrastructure even a private companies and as a
[3:41:21.760 --> 3:41:28.880]  dentured servants they have to allow uh pentagon air forces who's running it snooping hubs that
[3:41:28.880 --> 3:41:34.480]  control and save all the data this is open this makes what bush was doing look a look
[3:41:34.480 --> 3:41:40.000]  tame in comparison i'm nonpartisan so so it i guess it doesn't matter because they're seizing
[3:41:40.000 --> 3:41:48.720]  the infrastructure this is criminal it is and the solution i've been using is no good for this so
[3:41:48.720 --> 3:41:56.560]  what can we do we have to organize politically in mass organizations uh the only organization that
[3:41:56.560 --> 3:42:02.720]  i know of in the us that fights against these things is the electronic frontier foundation
[3:42:02.720 --> 3:42:09.280]  although i think the american civil liberties union fights also against some of them so both
[3:42:09.280 --> 3:42:16.080]  of those organizations deserve your support you know is it that americans and australians and
[3:42:16.080 --> 3:42:20.320]  british and others have had so much freedom in the past we can't believe it's happening here
[3:42:20.320 --> 3:42:26.720]  or have we lied to ourselves about how much freedom was really in our society uh i think that
[3:42:27.280 --> 3:42:34.960]  it's a combination of both it's certainly the case that there was much less uh surveillance of all
[3:42:34.960 --> 3:42:43.120]  our communication in the past uh you see this is one thing that digital technology makes much easier
[3:42:44.000 --> 3:42:53.280]  or in the 1960s i don't think anything kept track of who you called locally the phone exchange
[3:42:53.280 --> 3:42:59.440]  didn't keep track it just counted up how many how many calls you made and sometimes how long they were
[3:42:59.440 --> 3:43:05.120]  the only thing you got on your bill was long distance calls because they were expensive and
[3:43:05.120 --> 3:43:13.040]  people wanted to know what they were being billed for now in france after world war two
[3:43:14.240 --> 3:43:20.640]  the government insisted that the phone company must not keep any records of who called whom
[3:43:20.640 --> 3:43:26.400]  and the reason was that when the nazis took over france they looked at those records to see who
[3:43:26.400 --> 3:43:34.000]  spoke to whom and that way if they knew that one person seemed to be a possibly a center of political
[3:43:34.000 --> 3:43:39.600]  opposition they would not only arrest him but they would question all the people he tended
[3:43:39.600 --> 3:43:46.960]  to make phone calls to so after the war the french government in and various other governments in
[3:43:46.960 --> 3:43:55.760]  europe established the rules of the phone companies were not allowed to keep track however of course
[3:43:55.760 --> 3:44:02.240]  they've changed all that well exactly i just saw a story in the london telegraph in fact guys
[3:44:02.240 --> 3:44:06.720]  well you search engine this uh people have corrected me not to just always say google google
[3:44:06.720 --> 3:44:12.080]  we need to you know plug lycos and and and and scrugel dot org and everybody else in fact i'll
[3:44:12.080 --> 3:44:17.200]  ask you what you think are some good alternatives because i think google is becoming evil uh yeah
[3:44:17.200 --> 3:44:23.760]  uh at least from what i've seen but it was in the french news that people are real mad that a
[3:44:23.760 --> 3:44:29.200]  guy's friend sent him a message saying don't blow up the train because he was going on a ride
[3:44:29.200 --> 3:44:34.320]  and they were there waiting for him when he got to the train station it was another case in an
[3:44:34.320 --> 3:44:38.800]  airport where they made a joke in another european country and they admitted they said oh no the phone
[3:44:38.800 --> 3:44:47.920]  companies have ai nsa type keyword reading all of it and then flagging it everything is read and
[3:44:47.920 --> 3:44:53.440]  that kind of freaked the french out to realize but the same things going on here now this is just so
[3:44:53.440 --> 3:45:01.520]  disgusting well one thing people can do about that is just throw these things randomly into
[3:45:01.520 --> 3:45:07.120]  phone calls the way they do the way people have done for them through decades randomly into their
[3:45:07.120 --> 3:45:16.480]  messages uh there i don't know if anybody was ever looking for keywords uh in messages to decide to
[3:45:16.480 --> 3:45:23.520]  read them uh but if people have fun at least setting up programs that would automatically
[3:45:23.520 --> 3:45:27.920]  put such keywords into their mail no the nsa admits they do that and that's one of the 20
[3:45:27.920 --> 3:45:32.720]  year old technologies as i'm sure you know you're being humbled but uh no i mean and in fact there
[3:45:32.720 --> 3:45:39.680]  was articles in like 2002 where they were complaining that citizens what's the term for that where
[3:45:39.680 --> 3:45:44.320]  where i say yeah i got the football i got the green stuff yeah do you hear about that nuke that's
[3:45:44.320 --> 3:45:49.200]  gonna go off yeah i'll tell you what else and of course they were uh they also reported that
[3:45:49.200 --> 3:45:53.920]  really economic espionage is what's happening so yeah this new processors nine times faster than
[3:45:53.920 --> 3:45:58.400]  anything else ivm's god but don't let bob know i'm gonna be delivering it next tuesday that that
[3:45:58.400 --> 3:46:05.120]  just drives them completely ape mm-hmm well i hope so because if we keep them busy enough
[3:46:05.840 --> 3:46:12.800]  uh maybe they won't uh attack us as much but i have a feeling that that won't solve the problem
[3:46:12.800 --> 3:46:20.000]  really i don't see anything that's going to solve this problem except talking about freedom and
[3:46:20.000 --> 3:46:26.880]  demanding freedom and condemning the government attacks on our freedom and rejecting the excuses
[3:46:27.600 --> 3:46:33.120]  so it's political will we've got a recognized tyranny when it's in front of our nose that's the
[3:46:33.120 --> 3:46:40.640]  only solution i can see if it's a solution it's not going to be easy i wish i knew some clever
[3:46:40.640 --> 3:46:47.840]  technical method that could protect our freedom i was lucky you know in one particular area i saw
[3:46:47.840 --> 3:46:53.680]  a way that through technical work we could protect our freedom but only particular aspects of our
[3:46:53.680 --> 3:47:02.400]  freedom all the others are well they're different absolutely well well we're really appreciative
[3:47:02.400 --> 3:47:07.200]  of your time sir other facets other points that people should be made aware of that from your
[3:47:07.200 --> 3:47:11.360]  research and others research that are real threats to freedom right now because it seems not just
[3:47:11.360 --> 3:47:16.640]  threats we have this surveillance being institutionalized to where there's just no such thing as a
[3:47:16.640 --> 3:47:27.280]  fourth amendment yes uh we see uh the the logic for reasoning about privacy rights is screwed up
[3:47:27.280 --> 3:47:34.640]  in the u.s. uh it may have worked okay in the past uh the the argument usually is if a policeman
[3:47:34.640 --> 3:47:41.840]  could look could see it from the street then he's got a right to look and that made sense sort of
[3:47:41.840 --> 3:47:52.240]  in 1960 but now with computers that can record so much data if it's okay for the police to set up
[3:47:53.360 --> 3:48:00.320]  cameras and other kinds of sensors everywhere to keep track of everything that a policeman
[3:48:00.320 --> 3:48:07.520]  could theoretically have possibly seen from a public place about you and put all that together
[3:48:07.520 --> 3:48:12.880]  then he knows everything about you yeah and the pendulum's going the wrong way well look at
[3:48:12.880 --> 3:48:16.880]  london four million cameras and now they've made it illegal to videotape the police and
[3:48:16.880 --> 3:48:22.720]  they walk up and threaten to arrest tourists now videotaping monuments i mean you know government
[3:48:22.720 --> 3:48:26.800]  is way out of control because private corporate interests have turned government into nothing
[3:48:26.800 --> 3:48:34.000]  but their little lap dogs yes and a large part of the cause of this actually is so called free
[3:48:34.000 --> 3:48:42.240]  trade treaties yes i'd rather call low wage treaties because these treaties give the take the power
[3:48:42.240 --> 3:48:50.240]  from governments yes and give them to businesses the business says say if to the governments if
[3:48:50.240 --> 3:48:55.360]  you don't do exactly what we want we'll move to some other country and the the government
[3:48:55.360 --> 3:49:02.240]  and respond by saying oh yes we'll do whatever you want of course the politicians mostly aren't
[3:49:02.240 --> 3:49:10.000]  really strongly viewed with a wish to do anything else and they probably are somehow going to get
[3:49:10.000 --> 3:49:16.960]  rewarded for going along but when the people go to them and say we demand you regulate this
[3:49:16.960 --> 3:49:24.480]  practice the politicians have a ready excuse they say well given this treaty the companies
[3:49:24.480 --> 3:49:30.000]  were all just moved to another country so it's futile to even try to regulate them and then
[3:49:30.000 --> 3:49:36.320]  that creates a global standardized corporate law which has no liberty no freedom no due process
[3:49:36.320 --> 3:49:42.320]  they call that globalism and they hire a bunch of phony leftist and right-wingers to go around
[3:49:42.320 --> 3:49:46.800]  pushing it and spewing it and now they're trying to move internet control into these international
[3:49:46.800 --> 3:49:52.880]  bodies do you think the internet's going to survive i can't see the future i tend to be
[3:49:52.880 --> 3:50:00.400]  somewhat of a pessimist by nature uh it's just that even though even if i feel discouraged i
[3:50:00.400 --> 3:50:06.080]  keep on fighting so uh it's not particularly bad that i'm a pessimist but the point is
[3:50:07.360 --> 3:50:13.680]  if i try to answer that question all i could do is is uh tell you my pessimism which doesn't prove
[3:50:13.680 --> 3:50:19.760]  anything that's not the point the real question is what can we do to fight this we have to demand
[3:50:19.760 --> 3:50:25.120]  the abolition of these so-called free trade treaties you see the arguments for those free trade
[3:50:25.120 --> 3:50:32.880]  treaties are narrow minded they say well it makes for economic efficiencies and it does if all you're
[3:50:32.880 --> 3:50:41.520]  interested in is flat out efficiency of production then yeah they work but they give all their benefits
[3:50:41.520 --> 3:50:49.280]  to rich people and they corrupt the laws of every country that's participating and that hurts us far
[3:50:49.280 --> 3:50:56.000]  more than the benefits economically we might hope to get all right final segment with our guest richard
[3:50:56.000 --> 3:51:04.080]  stallman straight ahead i'm alex jones stay with us hi this is peter crownstown with mitis resources

[3:54:29.680 --> 3:54:33.840]  only you know we notice that the media and the establishment have tried to demonize the internet
[3:54:33.840 --> 3:54:38.640]  sir and they've tried to but now they're kind of having to join it but they still demonize it
[3:54:38.640 --> 3:54:43.440]  at the same time i'm pessimistic but i'm also positive that they've tried to control it and
[3:54:43.440 --> 3:54:49.760]  demonize it and and and kind of mutated before and uh that they are getting a lot of what they
[3:54:49.760 --> 3:54:55.440]  want in the way of tyranny but in a way people are just ignoring them and and and and we're going
[3:54:55.440 --> 3:55:01.600]  around them or a final comments on that front anything positive um you may be partly right
[3:55:01.600 --> 3:55:07.200]  but you know i don't keep track of the things that are working well i read the news about the
[3:55:07.200 --> 3:55:14.960]  threats and the outrages so yeah i keep on using the internet to talk with people about the free
[3:55:14.960 --> 3:55:22.160]  software movement i continue posting links to articles about various kinds of outrageous
[3:55:22.800 --> 3:55:29.280]  typically committed by governments and religious fanatics and so far i haven't been stopped from
[3:55:29.280 --> 3:55:34.960]  doing this yeah well i agree with you that we need to focus on the bad stuff that's happening so that
