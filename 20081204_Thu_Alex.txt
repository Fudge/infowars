[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:10.000 --> 00:11.000]  You want answers?
[00:11.000 --> 00:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:13.000 --> 00:32.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:32.000 --> 00:34.000]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34.000 --> 00:36.000]  Welcome and thank you for joining us.
[00:36.000 --> 00:42.000]  It is December 4, 2008, on this Thursday edition.
[00:42.000 --> 00:46.000]  I will tell you, we have a surprise guest in studio tomorrow, and just leave it at that.
[00:46.000 --> 00:49.000]  You know how I love surprises.
[00:49.000 --> 00:55.000]  We have several informative guests joining us, coming up later in the day.
[00:55.000 --> 00:59.000]  Professor Jeffrey F. Atticott, remember about a year ago?
[00:59.000 --> 01:08.000]  I debated him on CBS TV in San Antonio about how, well, there's not really a plan to put troops on the streets of America for law enforcement.
[01:08.000 --> 01:15.000]  No, and there's not a plan to get rid of the National Guard and federalize them, and no, everything's fine.
[01:15.000 --> 01:18.000]  Mr. Jones is paranoid.
[01:18.000 --> 01:20.000]  Now, it's all been announced.
[01:20.000 --> 01:27.000]  So, Professor Jeffrey F. Atticott is bravely joining us, coming up in 30 minutes here on the show,
[01:27.000 --> 01:32.000]  because he is at St. Mary's University School of Law in San Antonio,
[01:32.000 --> 01:38.000]  and his name is Professor of Director of the Center for Terrorism Law.
[01:38.000 --> 01:42.000]  And he is very, very prominent in all of this new form of law that really isn't new.
[01:42.000 --> 01:50.000]  It's quite Napoleonic, practice similar law in China, and in Stalinist Russia.
[01:50.000 --> 01:58.000]  So, we'll be going over all of that today with him, here on the air.
[01:58.000 --> 02:05.000]  And if you don't think secret military commissions and waterboarding and troops on the streets isn't Napoleonic,
[02:05.000 --> 02:07.000]  you don't know what Napoleonic law is.
[02:07.000 --> 02:10.000]  It's guilty until proven innocence.
[02:10.000 --> 02:14.000]  It is the state is God.
[02:14.000 --> 02:20.000]  Just dressed up in neocon and Obama-esque neo-lib clothing.
[02:20.000 --> 02:33.000]  And then we do have Major General Stubblebine joining us from Central America, along with his wife, Dr. Lebo, today.
[02:33.000 --> 02:36.000]  So, that is coming up.
[02:36.000 --> 02:40.000]  Also, for 30 minutes, coming up at the bottom of the next hour,
[02:40.000 --> 02:50.000]  we're going to have our weekly report on the economy from Bob Chapman and the international forecaster.
[02:50.000 --> 02:57.000]  It turns out that anti-terror police in London last week arrested, detained, kidnapped.
[02:57.000 --> 03:00.000]  They didn't have a warrant under common law.
[03:00.000 --> 03:06.000]  That was a kidnapping, official oppression, and that's not Alex Jones saying that.
[03:06.000 --> 03:12.000]  It's the Speaker of the Parliament now saying that.
[03:12.000 --> 03:18.000]  And they arrested him under terrorism auspices for what?
[03:18.000 --> 03:26.000]  Exposing that the government was secretly legalizing all of the illegal aliens in England while lying to the public
[03:26.000 --> 03:32.000]  and telling them they had to accept national ID cards to stop the illegal aliens.
[03:32.000 --> 03:39.000]  So, that's what they do. They went and busted into his house and stole all his computers and files
[03:39.000 --> 03:46.000]  and interrogated him for nine hours before even letting anyone know that he'd been grabbed.
[03:46.000 --> 03:54.000]  Of course, he was the shadow secretary of immigration.
[03:54.000 --> 03:56.000]  What is a shadow secretary?
[03:56.000 --> 04:00.000]  In the parliamentary system, the second strongest party, the conservatives, which he's a member of,
[04:00.000 --> 04:05.000]  then get a shadow secretary. They get representation.
[04:05.000 --> 04:11.000]  They're in the office, so he witnessed all these criminal activities going on, and they are criminal, violating all these laws.
[04:11.000 --> 04:19.000]  I mean, it came out, what, six years ago in the BBC even that Tony Blair had secretly legalized
[04:19.000 --> 04:23.000]  over a million immigrants in the first couple years of his administration?
[04:23.000 --> 04:29.000]  It's been in since 1996, been out since last year. Gordon Brown's in now.
[04:29.000 --> 04:37.000]  It's the same policies. Secret deals with the European Union to load the illegal aliens on the trains to bring them in.
[04:37.000 --> 04:42.000]  I mean, that's a big deal when governments are grabbing government officials without even warrants.
[04:42.000 --> 04:49.000]  I mean, powerful government officials. See, the illegitimate paramilitary government under the Queen's control
[04:49.000 --> 04:52.000]  out grabbing people, and that's who runs MI5 and MI6.
[04:52.000 --> 04:55.000]  That's just one of the stories. Literally, the news is off the charts.
[04:55.000 --> 05:01.000]  We'll cover it all when we get back. I'm Alex Jones. This is the GCN Radio Network, the WebcicerInfoWars.com.
[05:01.000 --> 05:07.000]  Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones. I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[05:07.000 --> 05:13.000]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key. You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[05:13.000 --> 05:19.000]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[05:19.000 --> 05:25.000]  Our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout for a special interest, so they ignored your screams not to do it.
[05:25.000 --> 05:31.000]  They turned off the telephones and emailed. They voted to print $850 billion at least out of thin air.
[05:31.000 --> 05:34.000]  This money now owns the American and European banks.
[05:34.000 --> 05:40.000]  The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities,
[05:40.000 --> 05:43.000]  particularly food beyond many Americans' reach.
[05:43.000 --> 05:50.000]  In pre-Nazi Germany's superinflation, the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days, until it reached over 4 billion marks.
[05:50.000 --> 05:54.000]  Food prices are skyrocketing so fast, there seems as if there may be no end in sight.
[05:54.000 --> 06:00.000]  The private banks, merging with our government, are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves.
[06:00.000 --> 06:07.000]  The stores have less food, but jack up prices to stay in business. Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared and be ready.
[06:07.000 --> 06:12.000]  Everything is zeroing in on food. One third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities.
[06:12.000 --> 06:16.000]  My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared, get self-sufficient, get food.
[06:16.000 --> 06:21.000]  For everybody out there listening, it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food,
[06:21.000 --> 06:28.000]  the government, the new-old order has a lot less control over you, and so it's a mindset, a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness.
[06:28.000 --> 06:31.000]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[06:31.000 --> 06:38.000]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports,
[06:38.000 --> 06:47.000]  and they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices. Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[06:47.000 --> 06:53.000]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the final list of high-quality, freeze-dried, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[06:53.000 --> 06:59.000]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[06:59.000 --> 07:04.000]  Again, 800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[07:04.000 --> 07:08.000]  Take action today. The first step is getting storable food.
[07:08.000 --> 07:16.000]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[07:16.000 --> 07:34.000]  Chrysler executives, failure could spark depression. Harvard hit by loss as crisis spreads to colleges. Prepare for depression-level unemployment, that's another headline, these are all mainstream.
[07:34.000 --> 07:49.000]  Israel plans for solo attack on Iran. Neocon still preparing for Iran attack.
[07:49.000 --> 08:05.000]  Pakistan TV channel says the attacks in India hatched by Hindu Zionists, that's the times of India.
[08:05.000 --> 08:18.000]  CFR Brookings to dominate Obama's strategy, UPI is reporting that Brookings openly is bragging that the Council on Farm Relations is already running the White House, as if they haven't always been in modern history.
[08:18.000 --> 08:29.000]  It took 90 minutes for the Daily News to steal the Empire State's building, Daily News. I meant to get to this yesterday, because this is what patriot mythology groups do.
[08:29.000 --> 08:41.000]  They file bogus paper through common law, and then engage in all sorts of havoc, and then of course they always end up going to prison or jail or getting indicted.
[08:41.000 --> 08:50.000]  But the scam just goes on, it's delusional, and it's destroying common law, and the power of common law and the system is using it to discredit common law.
[08:50.000 --> 09:05.000]  So I'm going to talk more about the cancer of the patriot mythology groups. I mean, I've been doing this a long time, folks, and I'm just so sick of trying to explain this to people I know personally here in Austin, and they just won't listen.
[09:05.000 --> 09:13.000]  They're like, what does patriot mythology have to do with the Empire State's building stolen in 90 minutes?
[09:13.000 --> 09:27.000]  Well, because your word of honor as a free man is extremely powerful, this has been a free society more free than any other nation on earth, at least for select groups, white males.
[09:27.000 --> 09:37.000]  But that liberty could be extended to all, but instead all were enslaved after the Civil War.
[09:37.000 --> 09:43.000]  Rice became privileges, we became wards of the states, 13th Amendment.
[09:43.000 --> 09:49.000]  But I'm digressing here, I just wanted to read headlines and get back into them, but I just look at this article.
[09:49.000 --> 09:57.000]  They went and filed deed paperwork and swore to it the courthouse and they said here, Empire State's building shares.
[09:57.000 --> 10:14.000]  Now, the point is, is that you go to prison for doing that later, but if somebody tries to steal your house, a lot of people don't know their rights and so don't know how to defend themselves.
[10:14.000 --> 10:26.000]  I'm also seeing patriot groups, different patriot quote leaders in the past, shysters, who show up and get people involved in trust and then make them the trust officer.
[10:26.000 --> 10:34.000]  I'll give you a little tip, never set up a trust with somebody who says they're going to make themselves the trust officer and they take people's property.
[10:34.000 --> 10:48.000]  I've kind of got to burn under my saddle about this because it really got bad about 9, 10 years ago and people kind of woke up to the scam and then now it's come back around with new shysters and I have to hear it constantly.
[10:48.000 --> 10:55.000]  And I want them to know this, I'm going to set up the proper guests, I'm going to do the proper research, but in the months to come, I am coming after you.
[10:55.000 --> 11:16.000]  Okay, I'm not just going to fight corrupt police and corrupt government, I'm sick of our own house being defiled and trashed by people operating under the flag of freedom and liberty.
[11:16.000 --> 11:24.000]  The whole society is imploding folks, corruption is everywhere, watch yourselves, be careful.
[11:24.000 --> 11:28.000]  You know, since I'm on this, I'll just get to this now and then I've got all this other news.
[11:28.000 --> 11:35.000]  Just briefly, it took 90 minutes for Daily News to steal the Empire State's building.
[11:35.000 --> 11:44.000]  In one of the biggest heists in American history, the Daily News stole the 2 billion Empire State building and it wasn't that hard.
[11:44.000 --> 12:01.000]  The News swiped the 102-story Art Deco skyscraper by drawing up a batch of bogus documents, making a fake notary stamp and filing paperwork with the city to transfer the deed to the property.
[12:01.000 --> 12:08.000]  Now see, they faked this, you could actually go in and swear it was you with a fake document and get it.
[12:08.000 --> 12:19.000]  And see, it is fake when somebody declares, I am really the owner of the Federal Reserve as a sovereign of the United States under oak leaves with a flag without a fringe.
[12:19.000 --> 12:27.000]  And then you speak magic mumbo jumbo and then you go file a lie.
[12:27.000 --> 12:30.000]  That's all that is.
[12:30.000 --> 12:37.000]  Some of the information was laughable because they wanted to make it clear that nobody's even reading these filings.
[12:37.000 --> 12:59.000]  The original King Kong Star is listed as a witness, Faye Ray, the name shared by the bank, Robert Willie Sutton, the bank robber, Willie Sutton and it just goes on and on.
[12:59.000 --> 13:08.000]  And then they were able to file it and get ownership of the Empire State Building in 90 minutes.
[13:08.000 --> 13:11.000]  That's all into the paperwork to go through.
[13:11.000 --> 13:27.000]  So I want to explain to people again, some shyster comes along and says give me $5,000 and I can file paperwork or show you how to sponge all your debts or to put leans on people.
[13:27.000 --> 13:29.000]  It's a scam.
[13:29.000 --> 13:32.000]  You're going to go to jail.
[13:32.000 --> 13:40.000]  And I really think a lot of these are government operatives and they're doing this to so corrupt the common law and the court system to where they totally abolish it.
[13:40.000 --> 13:44.000]  And then that's basically what the New York Daily News is calling for.
[13:44.000 --> 13:48.000]  You see how they're doing this?
[13:48.000 --> 13:57.000]  And I don't like our movement and again, it's many movements because people that don't trust the government, don't trust the mainstream media that disagree with what the government's doing.
[13:57.000 --> 14:02.000]  The alternative movement, the awakening movement, there's a thousand groups in there.
[14:02.000 --> 14:08.000]  But the media will use this and point at us with this and I'm digressing.
[14:08.000 --> 14:23.000]  I've seen so many people lose their houses and get in trouble with all this and there's even groups that will advertise themselves as regular debt relief, as reasonable debt relief and a good organization.
[14:23.000 --> 14:26.000]  Then they bait and switch when you actually call them.
[14:26.000 --> 14:32.000]  And the world's complex, it's a big place and I can't even keep track of it all.
[14:32.000 --> 14:36.000]  I'm just telling you this, if it looks too good to be true, it is.
[14:36.000 --> 14:39.000]  There's no free lunch.
[14:39.000 --> 14:42.000]  Okay?
[14:42.000 --> 14:43.000]  Now is the government fraudulent?
[14:43.000 --> 14:48.000]  Is it breaking the common law, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, engaging in all sorts of fraud and corruption?
[14:48.000 --> 14:49.000]  Absolutely.
[14:49.000 --> 14:51.000]  But it's forced to jure, forced to jure.
[14:51.000 --> 14:53.000]  It is the overwhelming force.
[14:53.000 --> 14:54.000]  They are criminal.
[14:54.000 --> 14:58.000]  They will enforce.
[14:58.000 --> 15:06.000]  You know, I hear Larry Becraft criticize all the time because he's able to win in court over and over again for people on IRS cases.
[15:06.000 --> 15:13.000]  And they go, well, he does it with technicalities and with the Constitution and with the fact that they're not following proper procedure.
[15:13.000 --> 15:20.000]  He's not doing it, you know, in that the IRS is a fraudulent, you know, private collection agency of the private federal reserve.
[15:20.000 --> 15:22.000]  Well, those arguments never work.
[15:22.000 --> 15:26.000]  No one's ever won under that.
[15:26.000 --> 15:30.000]  You can criticize the lawyer crier or Becraft or any of them.
[15:30.000 --> 15:31.000]  Why?
[15:31.000 --> 15:32.000]  Because they win.
[15:32.000 --> 15:34.000]  They just credit the criminal IRS.
[15:34.000 --> 15:36.000]  Again, more COINTELPRO, folks.
[15:36.000 --> 15:42.000]  That's all it is.
[15:42.000 --> 15:43.000]  I'm way off in left field.
[15:43.000 --> 15:48.000]  And as most listeners, this is such a wide audience, aren't even aware of what I'm talking about.
[15:48.000 --> 15:55.000]  But that's why I'm discussing it, because as you get deeper into the liberty movement, you need to understand the pitfalls.
[15:55.000 --> 16:01.000]  But if you're in a mall shopping mall parking lot, you better understand the pitfalls, the crimes explode.
[16:01.000 --> 16:04.000]  When you drink fluoride water out of the tap, better understand the pitfalls.
[16:04.000 --> 16:13.000]  I just have an instinct to want to warn people about dangers and things that are going on out there.
[16:13.000 --> 16:15.000]  All right, that's coming up later.
[16:15.000 --> 16:36.000]  Earlier in the first segment, I mentioned the fact that they arrested the government minister of over immigration in England secretly last week under terrorism powers.
[16:36.000 --> 16:39.000]  And they did it without a warrant.
[16:39.000 --> 16:45.000]  And now the parliament is making a big deal out of it. I'm going to play that later, because it is a big deal.
[16:45.000 --> 16:49.000]  And that dovetails with what's happening here in the United States and in Europe.
[16:49.000 --> 16:55.000]  They're arresting a bunch of reporters in France and other places for just criticizing Sarkozy, criticizing Merkel.
[16:55.000 --> 16:57.000]  They are setting up open tyranny.
[16:57.000 --> 17:02.000]  It's starting to happen, folks.
[17:02.000 --> 17:09.000]  And we're seeing reporters, hundreds of them arrested in the U.S. for refusing to give up sources when that's always been protected.
[17:09.000 --> 17:11.000]  They are attacking.
[17:11.000 --> 17:25.000]  The establishment is attacking the sacrosanct, guarded, honored institution of the press that is enshrined in the First Amendment.
[17:25.000 --> 17:32.000]  I had Taser International send me a threatening letter about writing articles criticizing Taser. I just called their lawyer up there and said, buddy, I'm going to come after you.
[17:32.000 --> 17:36.000]  And he said, oh, just forget it. It's okay. Fine. Just, just, just forget everything's fine.
[17:36.000 --> 17:45.000]  See, it's all about what they can get away with. I called that guy and I said, let's go. Let's go.
[17:45.000 --> 17:52.000]  I'm not saying bring it on, but you bring first blood on me. You, you, you come swinging at me. I'm going to come back swinging.
[17:52.000 --> 17:56.000]  I'm tired of this crap. Excuse me.
[17:56.000 --> 18:12.000]  Trying to intimidate our First Amendment. It ain't happening. This is the United States of America and you people may think it isn't, but it is.
[18:12.000 --> 18:15.000]  This is our country, not yours.
[18:15.000 --> 18:19.000]  We run this country. We're the people. I don't care what you claim.
[18:19.000 --> 18:25.000]  I don't care if you claim government's god and that troops running around with microwave guns and machine guns, working with the police's freedom.
[18:25.000 --> 18:31.000]  We know it isn't. And we're going to tell everybody else it isn't freedom.
[18:31.000 --> 18:34.000]  Uh, meanwhile, what's going on in England?
[18:34.000 --> 18:41.000]  London musicians must give police massive amounts of personal information performed live.
[18:41.000 --> 18:45.000]  Now they're claiming for basically public speaking, any event, playing music.
[18:45.000 --> 18:52.000]  You've got to go right to sure with the police and get authorization from them to meet and gather in main venues.
[18:52.000 --> 19:00.000]  See, a massive attack on free speech on the Magna Carta on the First Amendment.
[19:00.000 --> 19:03.000]  You understand, ladies and gentlemen, I've got another one here.
[19:03.000 --> 19:09.000]  It's just unbelievable. Wait till you hear this.
[19:09.000 --> 19:17.000]  Toxic heavy metals negatively impact our health. There in the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat, the products we use and the objects we touch.
[19:17.000 --> 19:23.000]  Exposure is impossible to avoid. Heavy metals build up within the body over a period of time causing poor health.
[19:23.000 --> 19:28.000]  However, with chelorex, they can be mobilized and excreted in a safe and effective manner.
[19:28.000 --> 19:35.000]  Chelorex was developed based on Dr. Alan Greenberg's clinical experience with heavy metal poisoning during his 25 years of medical practice.
[19:35.000 --> 19:45.000]  Chelorex does not contain EDTA and is made from all natural ingredients, enhancing the body's natural mechanisms for excreting heavy metals and preventing their reabsorption.
[19:45.000 --> 19:56.000]  Chelorex contains antioxidants to protect the liver, kidneys, central nervous system and immune functions and effectively mobilizes mercury and 15 other heavy metals including aluminum, arsenic, lead and more.

[20:06.000 --> 20:29.000]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[20:29.000 --> 20:43.000]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[20:43.000 --> 21:02.000]  The Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government and much, much more fabled enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[21:02.000 --> 21:17.000]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[21:32.000 --> 21:56.000]  The U.S. intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government and many other
[21:56.000 --> 22:08.000]  U.S. intelligence network, warnings and war games.
[22:26.000 --> 22:47.000]  The U.S. intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government and many other
[22:47.000 --> 23:16.000]  U.S. intelligence network, warnings and war games.
[23:16.000 --> 23:37.000]  The U.S. intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government and many other
[23:37.000 --> 23:52.000]  U.S. intelligence network, warnings and war games.
[23:52.000 --> 24:16.000]  Almost 50% of the parliament voted against the war in 1776 in the United States. It was patriots spies in England that most assuredly helped win the war against the crown as well as spies for the cause of liberty in France.
[24:16.000 --> 24:25.000]  And if you think you're going to butcher the Bill of Rights and Constitution in Magna Carta, you've got another thing coming.
[24:25.000 --> 24:32.000]  Now look at what's happening in England. This is Steve Watson. He has links to London Independent. Original story on this.
[24:32.000 --> 24:47.000]  Eight page form will detail names, aliases, private addresses, phone numbers of all musicians and ethnic background of the likely audience.
[24:47.000 --> 25:06.000]  Forms 696 and other similar forms for even speeches, poetry, any public gathering the police have to a week before certify it. You have to get a license and then that turns a right into a privilege.
[25:06.000 --> 25:21.000]  What is a license? It is authorization, a letter of mark through imperial crown law, through the ancient law of tyrants to do something that is illegal.
[25:21.000 --> 25:37.000]  And if we let this go through with the free speech zones and several cities like New York want people to get permits to have political rallies inside buildings, quote, everyone's safety, then it allows them to start regulating and controlling it.
[25:37.000 --> 26:00.000]  Excellent story at infowars.net by Steve Watson. London musicians must give police huge swaths of personal information to perform live. Musicians and performers in London will soon be required by law to complete and hand over to police in eight page form detailing all their personal information and ethnic background.
[26:00.000 --> 26:10.000]  Another audience that they want to perform, again, making you report all about yourself to be able to even meet and have poetry or music or any other spoken word.
[26:10.000 --> 26:22.000]  Total tyranny. The Soviet Union didn't make you do this. They would just have spies there to see what you said. They want to find out who's talking, who's singing, who is an artist, who is involved.
[26:22.000 --> 26:42.000]  They did have this in East Germany, the worst the world's ever seen next to North Korea for oppression. And of course there were all these pimps, all these fat bureaucrats and pimps who, for theaters or for TV or for local poetry, that you'd have to go get certified by to be able to even go speak.
[26:42.000 --> 26:52.000]  This is the height of cultural tyranny. And they are proposing similar things here in the United States.
[26:52.000 --> 27:05.000]  Here's another one. UK Daily Mail today. Big brother police to get wartime power to demand ID in the street on pain of sending you to jail. They've already been doing this without law for years.
[27:05.000 --> 27:16.000]  State officials are giving power previously reserved in times of war to demand a person's proof of identity at any time. Remember, they swore the National ID card wouldn't be used for this.
[27:16.000 --> 27:24.000]  Anybody who refuses big brother demand could face arrest and a possible prison sentence.
[27:24.000 --> 27:34.000]  They're doing similar things in Australia and the news said, well, that's not too big of a sentence, two years in jail. What's wrong with that?
[27:34.000 --> 27:46.000]  The move would effectively take Britain back to World War II when people were stopped and asked to show their papers. And it says here that this is overall to stop illegal aliens.
[27:46.000 --> 27:52.000]  Folks, the government secretly legalized over a million of them.
[27:52.000 --> 28:04.000]  5,000 of them were put in high level security jobs because tyrannical government likes to bring in foreigners to do this stuff for them. And then when the minister said this is illegal, they went and arrested him under terrorism.
[28:04.000 --> 28:13.000]  When he's the boss of the agency appointed by the elected parliament. Again, the British government is spying on every member of parliament. That's been in the news.
[28:13.000 --> 28:27.000]  It's not the British government. It is the illegal old pre-1215 crown coming back. When Tony Blair first got elected, I'll never forget the BBC headline, the Magna Carta is dead and he swore to abolish it.
[28:27.000 --> 28:35.000]  Just an outrageous declaration of tyranny.
[28:35.000 --> 28:46.000]  And now they want to use troops on the streets of America for, quote, civil insurrection, crowd control under federal control, abolishing the state control of the National Guard.
[28:46.000 --> 28:59.000]  We'll talk about it with somebody on the other side of the issue. When we get back, prisonplanet.com and truthnews.us are just two of our websites. Check them out today.

[32:08.000 --> 32:23.000]  Jeffrey F. Atticott is a distinguished professor of law and the director of the Center for Terrorism Law at St. Mary's University.
[32:23.000 --> 32:29.000]  School of Law, San Antonio, Texas. He's an active-duty army officer.
[32:29.000 --> 32:39.000]  In the Judge Advocate General Corps for 20 years, he retired in 2000 at the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.
[32:39.000 --> 32:45.000]  Professor Atticott spent a quarter of his career as a senior legal advisor to the U.S. State's Army Special Forces.
[32:45.000 --> 32:49.000]  He was in the forces and has been in combat.
[32:49.000 --> 32:53.000]  As an internationally recognized authority on national security law, terrorism and human rights law,
[32:53.000 --> 32:59.000]  Professor Atticott not only lectures and participates in professional and academic organizations,

[33:03.000 --> 33:06.000]  including Fox News, MSNBC, on and on and on.
[33:06.000 --> 33:12.000]  He's also published books, articles, and a lot more on a variety of legal topics.

[33:24.000 --> 33:32.000]  Mr. Atticott, we debated for about 10 minutes a year ago on CBS San Antonio down there where you live,
[33:32.000 --> 33:36.000]  and I talked about quite a few things. You kind of laughed them off.
[33:36.000 --> 33:42.000]  I was saying there was a plan to federalize the National Guard over the governors,
[33:42.000 --> 33:45.000]  make the governors federal officers dual-hatted.
[33:45.000 --> 33:49.000]  I said that there was a plan to use them for civil insurrection, civil unrest, rioting,
[33:49.000 --> 33:56.000]  and now that's been all over the news, Army Times, Washington Post, and I asked you during the break, you said you are aware of all that.
[33:56.000 --> 34:01.000]  Tell me, as a legal scholar in this area, what's your view on it?
[34:01.000 --> 34:11.000]  These things have already been in place for decades because the National Guard can be federalized at the request of the governor to handle emergencies,
[34:11.000 --> 34:16.000]  insurrections, as we had the riots out in California some years back with Rodney King issues.
[34:16.000 --> 34:21.000]  We had the same thing in Arkansas during desegregation times.
[34:21.000 --> 34:26.000]  It's something that's not new, but it's certainly getting more consolidated.
[34:26.000 --> 34:36.000]  I think you're correct. We're seeing a tightening of the federal noose around what the states would do with their National Guards.
[34:36.000 --> 34:43.000]  A lot of former JAG officers are saying, this is an endopausic commentatus, that this is outrageous, that this is dangerous.
[34:43.000 --> 34:48.000]  This is a major change. It says that they're federally under Northcom. They're going to serve longer.
[34:48.000 --> 34:52.000]  They're going to be integrated into the main force, and they're going to be under Northcom,
[34:52.000 --> 34:59.000]  and then that the governor will then serve dual-hatted at the pleasure of the president under PDD 51.
[34:59.000 --> 35:06.000]  You're right to say that Gates says 25 of the 80-something recommendations are already in place.
[35:06.000 --> 35:12.000]  These are recommendations which I would not agree with. I don't think it's necessary.
[35:12.000 --> 35:20.000]  Of course, you and I would both agree that what we're really talking about is the balance between increased security and civil liberties or independence.
[35:20.000 --> 35:26.000]  The military plays a vital function in our society because they protect us from external enemies,
[35:26.000 --> 35:33.000]  where the police force is protected from internal enemies. The question is, how much protection do we need and at what expense?
[35:33.000 --> 35:41.000]  The general guidance of some of these recommendations, particularly to increase the federal role,
[35:41.000 --> 35:48.000]  is something that I'm never comfortable with as an advocate of states' rights. I'm more of a strict constructionist than that.
[35:48.000 --> 35:51.000]  I'm glad that you're not a tyrant.
[35:51.000 --> 35:58.000]  Well, I don't know about that. I understand that balance, and I think we have to realize in this time of the war on terror
[35:58.000 --> 36:03.000]  that the balance is going to shift to some degree towards increased security.
[36:03.000 --> 36:08.000]  If you accept the premise that we're in a state of war, which our Congress, president, and courts have accepted,
[36:08.000 --> 36:12.000]  then that balance has got to shift to some degree. The threat is real.
[36:12.000 --> 36:21.000]  The bipartisan commission said, we can expect an attack, weapons, a nuclear, chemical, or biological attack on the homeland by 2013.
[36:21.000 --> 36:26.000]  And this is a panel made up of former Democrats, former Republicans.
[36:26.000 --> 36:36.000]  Brookings institutions, council on foreign relations, wonks, who are the same ones that recommend national ID cards, face scanning cameras everywhere.
[36:36.000 --> 36:39.000]  They recommend what the military industrial complex wants.
[36:39.000 --> 36:43.000]  Here's the deal, professor. We all know quietly.
[36:43.000 --> 36:54.000]  I mean, were you aware that in the late 80s, they had Marines dressed up in police jackets raiding gun dealers in places like North Carolina?
[36:54.000 --> 37:00.000]  Well, no. In the late 80s, I was overseas, you know, and pretty much knows the grindstone doing stuff.
[37:00.000 --> 37:09.000]  Well, I mean, are you aware of a large, creeping covert operation by the Army domestically? I mean, it's been in the news 50 times or more in the last month
[37:09.000 --> 37:13.000]  about Army intelligence spying on peace groups. I mean, you've heard about that, right?
[37:13.000 --> 37:16.000]  I've heard some stories about that, but I don't have any direct knowledge.
[37:16.000 --> 37:22.000]  But I do know that the military with Northcom is expanding their role.
[37:22.000 --> 37:27.000]  I do know that JAG officers are responsible to ensure that they don't cross any lines.
[37:27.000 --> 37:33.000]  And that's why we have JAG officers that are on the ground. There's a lot of stuff that's going on that is classified.
[37:33.000 --> 37:41.000]  I work with Northcom and I work with the Air Force on cyber issues, but I can only go to a certain degree because a lot of stuff is classified.
[37:41.000 --> 37:50.000]  But I have heard anecdotally from other JAG officers that they've had to weigh in and tell individuals that are conducting surveillance operations,
[37:50.000 --> 37:57.000]  for example, to remind them what the laws are that we cannot use the military to engage in surveillance on U.S. citizens.
[37:57.000 --> 38:04.000]  And you do have some of these harebrained commanders that come up with these ideas and, you know, have to be constantly watched.
[38:04.000 --> 38:10.000]  And I think that's why it's important that you're out there as a voice, you know, reminding people that things, you know,
[38:10.000 --> 38:16.000]  and I know the information you get is not always 100% accurate, but it's something that we need to remind ourselves.
[38:16.000 --> 38:24.000]  Well, I mean, I've had guys in Department of Defense cars get out of the car, wait for me at my car and threaten me.
[38:24.000 --> 38:32.000]  Okay, and that was about nine years ago. So believe me, I've had Delta Force security come up with guns.
[38:32.000 --> 38:42.000]  This was, by the way, in the newspaper in San Antonio and pull guns out and stick them to our chest in 99 when they were down there trying to buy off politicians.
[38:42.000 --> 38:51.000]  Did you see that in the Associated Press when they tried to buy the mayor and the police chief and the sheriff and they said no to the bags of cash that was in the Associated Press?
[38:51.000 --> 38:52.000]  Yeah, but you know what?
[38:52.000 --> 38:53.000]  Oh, just bags of cash.
[38:53.000 --> 39:01.000]  That would dealt with, you know, the media. You've got to take a large grain of salt when you listen to a lot of media stories because I've had a lot of media stories.
[39:01.000 --> 39:07.000]  I mean, I had guys in uniforms stick, stick, stick, pull guns out on us, sir, in San Antonio.
[39:07.000 --> 39:09.000]  No, I'm not doubting that that was the case.
[39:09.000 --> 39:12.000]  All because I wanted to go see what the Army was doing.
[39:12.000 --> 39:18.000]  Well, I mean, were you attempting to go on to a reservation where it was unauthorized to go? I mean, what was the facts of it?
[39:18.000 --> 39:29.000]  Absolutely. It was Fort Sam Houston, an open base. This is pre-911 and we're there and they had gone in and blown out a bunch of windows there.
[39:29.000 --> 39:37.000]  They've been trying to drill secretly in the city. They've been forced onto the base and so we're there trying to go interview people on the base.
[39:37.000 --> 39:41.000]  So they just ran out and pointed guns at us and took our tapes and erased them and threw us off.
[39:41.000 --> 39:48.000]  But I have had them come after me and point guns at me in Florida off of a base.
[39:48.000 --> 39:55.000]  Well, you know, I, again, I don't know the circumstances, but I do understand, you know, in positions that you have in positions I have.
[39:55.000 --> 39:59.000]  I've had death threats from NPR for Pete's sake. I've had, you know, Air America hang up on me.
[39:59.000 --> 40:09.000]  I've had all sorts of spurious comments made about, you know, all sorts of things that they're totally untrue and you get kind of wonder who are these people and what's their real agenda.
[40:09.000 --> 40:14.000]  Instead of me just beating over the head, let me ask you this. You said these are just recommendations from Gates.
[40:14.000 --> 40:22.000]  Look, there's 80 plus recommendations. He says 25 are fully implemented and no changes needed.
[40:22.000 --> 40:30.000]  And you read those and it, listen, they already had the explosive ordinance teams and then the other secret teams behind them.
[40:30.000 --> 40:34.000]  We had an FBI guy pull up at a checkpoint. The army was running in 98.
[40:34.000 --> 40:36.000]  It's all on video, sir. I can send it to you.
[40:36.000 --> 40:41.000]  Jump out of the car and say, you can't videotape these army people at a checkpoint.
[40:41.000 --> 40:43.000]  And I said, well, we're going to keep doing it.
[40:43.000 --> 40:50.000]  So he gave us a print out for the media, but under it, he gave us that said not for distribution secret.
[40:50.000 --> 40:55.000]  And by the way, this is on my website said we are in 77 counties. Don't tell the public.
[40:55.000 --> 41:00.000]  We're here for warrants service. We're here to assist you in any and all ways.
[41:00.000 --> 41:05.000]  Now, is it legal and lawful? And you're going to say you don't know about this.
[41:05.000 --> 41:12.000]  I found that hard to believe to have the army doing warrants service in 77 counties as of 10 years ago.
[41:12.000 --> 41:13.000]  I don't know what's going on now.
[41:13.000 --> 41:14.000]  No, it would be illegal.
[41:14.000 --> 41:20.000]  What you described is illegal 10 years ago, and it would be illegal today.
[41:20.000 --> 41:26.000]  The army cannot engage in search and seizure arrest warrants service on civilians.
[41:26.000 --> 41:31.000]  And that's a job that the civilian police officers would have to do.
[41:31.000 --> 41:35.000]  And the military would be prohibited from doing that by the Posse-Komitana Act,
[41:35.000 --> 41:37.000]  which has a lot of exceptions, but that's not one of the exceptions.
[41:37.000 --> 41:40.000]  They cannot engage in support to law enforcement.
[41:40.000 --> 41:42.000]  They cannot engage in search and seizure. No.
[41:42.000 --> 41:45.000]  That's what they called it. They said, we want to support you in warrants service.
[41:45.000 --> 41:47.000]  We want to support you at least at all.
[41:47.000 --> 41:54.000]  But I mean, support. I mean, what is support when I've got Swansborough, North Carolina, Marines,
[41:54.000 --> 42:00.000]  openly running a real checkpoint, not a drill, searching people's cars with the police?
[42:00.000 --> 42:02.000]  Now, what is that?
[42:02.000 --> 42:05.000]  Yeah, I mean, that's the issue is where do you cross the line?
[42:05.000 --> 42:12.000]  There's been a series of lawsuits against different entities with starting a wounded knee,
[42:12.000 --> 42:17.000]  which I'm familiar with, and moving into some of the other support issues, quote, unquote.
[42:17.000 --> 42:22.000]  And to this day, no soldier has ever served any jail time,
[42:22.000 --> 42:25.000]  even though the courts have looked at this and said there's been some violations.
[42:25.000 --> 42:28.000]  No one has ever been fined, and no one has ever served any jail time.
[42:28.000 --> 42:33.000]  So you've got to wonder, does the Posse-Komitana Act really have any teeth?
[42:33.000 --> 42:35.000]  Let me ask you this.
[42:35.000 --> 42:39.000]  I mean, overall, historically, the founders, common sense, our culture,
[42:39.000 --> 42:45.000]  he said we have to get rid of our cultural prejudices against having federal troops in America
[42:45.000 --> 42:47.000]  engaging in law enforcement.
[42:47.000 --> 42:52.000]  I mean, it says civil unrest, riot control.
[42:52.000 --> 42:53.000]  That's now on record.
[42:53.000 --> 42:56.000]  And with all these denials about it, I mean, is that the American way?
[42:56.000 --> 43:00.000]  I mean, you talk about terrorism, this isn't a chemical or biological attack.
[43:00.000 --> 43:04.000]  This is rioting civil unrest, microwave cannons.
[43:04.000 --> 43:07.000]  Well, as you know, the Posse-Komitana Act is not in the Constitution.
[43:07.000 --> 43:12.000]  It's a congressional law that was passed in 1878, and there's many exceptions to it.
[43:12.000 --> 43:15.000]  But it's not, when you say it's a part of the American way,
[43:15.000 --> 43:19.000]  but it's not a constitutional issue that the military can't engage in these activities.
[43:19.000 --> 43:22.000]  Well, I mean, what's the section of the Constitution, though, that says don't court the troops,
[43:22.000 --> 43:24.000]  don't have them engaging the people?
[43:24.000 --> 43:25.000]  I can pull it up here.
[43:25.000 --> 43:27.000]  Yeah, but I mean, living in their house, that's all it says.
[43:27.000 --> 43:30.000]  It doesn't say that you can't engage in the rest or search in seizure, those types of things,
[43:30.000 --> 43:32.000]  as it did during Reconstruction during the Civil War.
[43:32.000 --> 43:36.000]  I mean, they were all over the place engaging in law enforcement in the South.
[43:36.000 --> 43:39.000]  And as a consequence of that, that's how we got the Posse-Komitana Act.
[43:39.000 --> 43:40.000]  They didn't live in people's houses.
[43:40.000 --> 43:42.000]  Well, now they just seize your house.
[43:42.000 --> 43:43.000]  Well, yeah.
[43:43.000 --> 43:47.000]  Now the police just, with acid, forage, and seizure, they just seize it and throw you out and move in.
[43:47.000 --> 43:51.000]  So, you know, the Supreme Court has said that, you know, that the state itself can say,
[43:51.000 --> 43:53.000]  we want your property, and boom, it's gone.
[43:53.000 --> 43:57.000]  Yeah, but how do they do that without a judge, a jury, an indictment?
[43:57.000 --> 44:00.000]  I mean, you know about all the cases where they just, the old ladies got four grand and her purse,
[44:00.000 --> 44:01.000]  so they take it?
[44:01.000 --> 44:05.000]  Well, yeah, I mean, they do it because the Supreme Court has said they can do it.
[44:05.000 --> 44:08.000]  The Supreme Court said without even arresting you, they can take your money?
[44:08.000 --> 44:12.000]  Oh, no, I say, if you're talking about seizure property that the Supreme Court has said,
[44:12.000 --> 44:14.000]  the state has the right to take your property.
[44:14.000 --> 44:16.000]  Yeah, but after you've been found guilty.
[44:16.000 --> 44:19.000]  I mean, you're aware they're taking property without that.
[44:19.000 --> 44:21.000]  Well, no, they can take public property.
[44:21.000 --> 44:23.000]  The Supreme Court, this is maybe a little bit off track,
[44:23.000 --> 44:26.000]  but the Supreme Court ruled a couple of years ago that states have the right to say,
[44:26.000 --> 44:29.000]  we like your property on the corner of such and such and such.
[44:29.000 --> 44:31.000]  Oh, you're talking about New London kilo, yeah.
[44:31.000 --> 44:33.000]  Yeah, I mean, you know, they're just taking a property.
[44:33.000 --> 44:35.000]  I mean, that's outrageous, but, you know, there we go.
[44:35.000 --> 44:37.000]  It's, you know, thank goodness.
[44:37.000 --> 44:38.000]  It's a final call, though.
[44:38.000 --> 44:42.000]  Well, thank goodness, the Supreme Court, at least, came down the right side of the Second Amendment
[44:42.000 --> 44:47.000]  at this last term when they recognized, you know, the private right of private individuals
[44:47.000 --> 44:49.000]  to own firearms, and that's...
[44:49.000 --> 44:54.000]  Not in the addendum, they said, but we can reasonably restrict it under laws.
[44:54.000 --> 44:57.000]  So that's really a gun grab.
[44:57.000 --> 44:59.000]  It's a gun grab, but at least they...
[44:59.000 --> 45:02.000]  This is the first time they recognized that there was a constitutional right.
[45:02.000 --> 45:07.000]  They did away with the nonsense that, well, the Second Amendment clause only applies to the militia.
[45:07.000 --> 45:09.000]  They said, no, it applies to individuals.
[45:09.000 --> 45:14.000]  That's 5-4, but still, you know, we've at least got some sanity on that issue.
[45:14.000 --> 45:19.000]  But, you know, there's a lot of things about this country that are...that are...that need watching.
[45:19.000 --> 45:22.000]  There's no...no, not about it, but there's also a thing of a perfect government.
[45:22.000 --> 45:25.000]  We've...we've got a...you know, we've got a...definitely...
[45:25.000 --> 45:29.000]  But governments...governments killed more people last century than anything else.
[45:29.000 --> 45:30.000]  Hundreds of millions.
[45:30.000 --> 45:33.000]  Government's always been the greatest threat to liberty.
[45:33.000 --> 45:37.000]  I'm more worried about a government with troops on the streets working with the police
[45:37.000 --> 45:39.000]  standing on street corners with machine guns.
[45:39.000 --> 45:42.000]  They're saying nationwide, this is going to happen.
[45:42.000 --> 45:47.000]  And I am about al-Qaeda, whatever that, you know, supposedly is.
[45:47.000 --> 45:53.000]  I mean, I'm a lot more worried about, you know, the end of my republic.
[45:53.000 --> 45:55.000]  I hear you.
[45:55.000 --> 45:57.000]  I mean, I'm very concerned about that, that also.
[45:57.000 --> 46:02.000]  And, you know, it requires constant vigilance to ensure that big government doesn't make little people.
[46:02.000 --> 46:06.000]  We need little government to make big people where you have your own decisions,
[46:06.000 --> 46:08.000]  make up your own minds about things.
[46:08.000 --> 46:12.000]  But we're seeing the shift in that. I mean, this last election was all about, you know,
[46:12.000 --> 46:15.000]  the big government is going to take care of you from cradle to grave.
[46:15.000 --> 46:20.000]  Well, it seems like I'm talking to a different person because when I debated you on the...on the show,
[46:20.000 --> 46:23.000]  you were basically just poo-pooing everything I said.
[46:23.000 --> 46:25.000]  We can play the clip if you want.
[46:25.000 --> 46:28.000]  And then now...I mean, my point is I'm tired of people telling me
[46:28.000 --> 46:32.000]  that I haven't been to urban warfare drills where they have role-players screaming,
[46:32.000 --> 46:36.000]  I'm an American, please don't put me in a camp, please don't take my guns.
[46:36.000 --> 46:40.000]  And I know that they gave the 29 Palm Survey, but I know they've given a lot of new surveys.
[46:40.000 --> 46:43.000]  Will you fire on citizens? Will you confiscate guns?
[46:43.000 --> 46:46.000]  I know in New Orleans they took guns from high and dry people.
[46:46.000 --> 46:51.000]  I know that in Illinois, two months ago, the governor announced they're going to use the military,
[46:51.000 --> 46:55.000]  the National Guard, in anti-gun sweeps statewide.
[46:55.000 --> 46:59.000]  That was in the Chicago Tribune. I played the governor's press conference here.
[46:59.000 --> 47:04.000]  I mean, sir, having the military pointed at the people, this is not for al-Qaeda.
[47:04.000 --> 47:07.000]  They're saying this is for civil unrest.
[47:07.000 --> 47:12.000]  Right. I mean, they're looking at, you know, at a possibility if we have civil unrest.
[47:12.000 --> 47:15.000]  I mean, if we had a bioterrorism attack, which is a likelihood,
[47:15.000 --> 47:17.000]  and that's what one of the things the commission reported,
[47:17.000 --> 47:23.000]  that they felt it was more likely than not that we would have a bioterrorism attack by 2013,
[47:23.000 --> 47:27.000]  that's where you get somebody, for example, smallpox is infectious, anthrax is not.
[47:27.000 --> 47:32.000]  But if you really had one of those issues occur, as we did in the early 1900s,
[47:32.000 --> 47:36.000]  you would see pandemonium in this entire society.
[47:36.000 --> 47:39.000]  You'd have to quarantine cities. Who's going to do that?
[47:39.000 --> 47:41.000]  Or a financial collapse.
[47:41.000 --> 47:46.000]  Well, that's possible. I mean, if people can't eat, in law and order,
[47:46.000 --> 47:50.000]  you have the local folks that are responsible for it, but if they can't handle it,
[47:50.000 --> 47:53.000]  who's going to handle a pandemic? Who's going to handle these types of things?
[47:53.000 --> 47:56.000]  It has to be the military. They have to be trained for it.
[47:56.000 --> 47:59.000]  Hey, did you hear about that anthrax case?
[47:59.000 --> 48:03.000]  The AP reported the whole White House was on CEPRO, September 10th,
[48:03.000 --> 48:06.000]  three weeks before the letters were mailed?
[48:06.000 --> 48:08.000]  I had not heard that, no.
[48:08.000 --> 48:09.000]  Oh.
[48:09.000 --> 48:10.000]  I had not heard that.
[48:10.000 --> 48:13.000]  Oh, Google it. You're a smart guy. Do you have a computer in front of you?
[48:13.000 --> 48:15.000]  Well, I'm not right now, but I'm at home.
[48:15.000 --> 48:18.000]  But I want you to know, I'm not just saying that.
[48:18.000 --> 48:24.000]  It was US Army weaponized anthrax, and the FBI claimed it was made in a bathtub,
[48:24.000 --> 48:27.000]  but it turned out it was weaponized. It was from Fort Dietrich.
[48:27.000 --> 48:29.000]  Well, yeah, that's the scariest thing at all.
[48:29.000 --> 48:32.000]  The fellow that apparently did this was one of our own.
[48:32.000 --> 48:35.000]  I mean, he was a low-willed terrorist from Fort Dietrich.
[48:35.000 --> 48:39.000]  You know, we have five people dead and 17 seriously injured,
[48:39.000 --> 48:42.000]  but the good news about anthrax is it's not contagious.
[48:42.000 --> 48:43.000]  Yes.
[48:43.000 --> 48:46.000]  Whereas other bio-logical, you know...
[48:46.000 --> 48:47.000]  Smallpox is, yeah.
[48:47.000 --> 48:48.000]  Right?
[48:48.000 --> 48:49.000]  Yeah, I mean, they're contagious.
[48:49.000 --> 48:51.000]  Well, you know, that's why they discontinued four years ago,
[48:51.000 --> 48:53.000]  trying to give the smallpox shot to first responders,
[48:53.000 --> 48:58.000]  because they found it was actually causing real smallpox outbreaks,
[48:58.000 --> 49:01.000]  and it was a live smallpox injection,
[49:01.000 --> 49:04.000]  and also the police and military were refusing to take it.
[49:04.000 --> 49:05.000]  I wonder why?
[49:05.000 --> 49:08.000]  Maybe they don't love America.
[49:08.000 --> 49:11.000]  Well, I was very nervous about the forced anthrax shots
[49:11.000 --> 49:14.000]  we were required to take when I was in the military,
[49:14.000 --> 49:16.000]  and I'm kind of worried about flu shots.
[49:16.000 --> 49:18.000]  It's the best way to get the flu.
[49:18.000 --> 49:19.000]  Take the shot.
[49:19.000 --> 49:20.000]  I agree.
[49:20.000 --> 49:23.000]  But I mean, seriously, I mean, we...
[49:23.000 --> 49:24.000]  Having been in the military for 20 years
[49:24.000 --> 49:26.000]  and worked with the federal government,
[49:26.000 --> 49:29.000]  I can tell you that they're extremely incompetent,
[49:29.000 --> 49:31.000]  and a lot of these issues that come up
[49:31.000 --> 49:33.000]  out in New Spaces' various reports,
[49:33.000 --> 49:36.000]  where they assign these great, you know, schemes
[49:36.000 --> 49:38.000]  that the military is prepared to carry out
[49:38.000 --> 49:39.000]  with these crackerjack soldiers.
[49:39.000 --> 49:40.000]  We just don't have them.
[49:40.000 --> 49:42.000]  I mean, I wish we were that competent,
[49:42.000 --> 49:43.000]  but there is a...
[49:43.000 --> 49:44.000]  Oh, really?
[49:44.000 --> 49:45.000]  If I don't pay my taxes,
[49:45.000 --> 49:47.000]  they're going to come take my house and arrest me.
[49:47.000 --> 49:49.000]  They seem pretty competent there.
[49:49.000 --> 49:51.000]  Well, yeah, but it's...
[49:51.000 --> 49:52.000]  You know, you get your good lawyer,
[49:52.000 --> 49:54.000]  you can drag it out for a while, but...
[49:54.000 --> 49:55.000]  You know, you're a very interesting fellow.
[49:55.000 --> 49:57.000]  We've only got two more segments with you,
[49:57.000 --> 49:59.000]  but I tell you, you're telling me they're incompetent.
[49:59.000 --> 50:01.000]  You know, there's not a problem.
[50:01.000 --> 50:02.000]  But you know what?
[50:02.000 --> 50:05.000]  I see a lot of precision here.
[50:05.000 --> 50:07.000]  I mean, the military can shoot a cruise missile
[50:07.000 --> 50:08.000]  down your chimney.
[50:08.000 --> 50:09.000]  I don't think...
[50:09.000 --> 50:11.000]  What will you do when the economy collapses?
[50:11.000 --> 50:14.000]  Store shelves are empty and your stored food is gone.
[50:14.000 --> 50:16.000]  How will you feed your family?
[50:16.000 --> 50:19.000]  True self-sufficiency and peace of mind is being able
[50:19.000 --> 50:21.000]  to grow a wide range of crops,
[50:21.000 --> 50:23.000]  ensuring a well-balanced diet for your family.

[51:08.000 --> 51:12.000]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history,
[51:12.000 --> 51:15.000]  a terrorist act of war against this country.
[51:15.000 --> 51:18.000]  The enemies struck America on September 11th.
[51:18.000 --> 51:19.000]  But who is the enemy?
[51:19.000 --> 51:20.000]  bin Laden.
[51:20.000 --> 51:21.000]  This is his MO.
[51:21.000 --> 51:23.000]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[51:23.000 --> 51:25.000]  We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[51:25.000 --> 51:28.000]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look
[51:28.000 --> 51:30.000]  at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks
[51:30.000 --> 51:32.000]  inside the United States.
[51:32.000 --> 51:35.000]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis, again,
[51:35.000 --> 51:38.000]  very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[51:38.000 --> 51:42.000]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.

[51:46.000 --> 51:49.000]  the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[51:49.000 --> 51:53.000]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.

[53:35.000 --> 53:40.000]  We're even told that there would be martial law in America if we voted no.
[53:40.000 --> 53:43.000]  That's what I call fear-mongering.
[53:43.000 --> 53:45.000]  All right, we had Congressman Sherman on.
[53:45.000 --> 53:46.000]  That was Brad Sherman.
[53:46.000 --> 53:48.000]  We also, of course, have Senator Inhofe on record.
[53:48.000 --> 53:53.000]  They were threatened with physical martial law and Congress being ignored
[53:53.000 --> 53:57.000]  if the bankers weren't given the empowerment bill, Professor Atticott.
[53:57.000 --> 54:00.000]  And that's exactly what I told you a year ago on TV.
[54:00.000 --> 54:04.000]  I said PDD-51, the Homeland Security Committee, isn't even allowed to see it.
[54:04.000 --> 54:09.000]  The cover sheet expanded the powers of the executive under COG.
[54:09.000 --> 54:11.000]  I mean, is this American?
[54:11.000 --> 54:13.000]  Is this America?
[54:13.000 --> 54:16.000]  And I can play Inhofe, the senator if you'd like, Republican from Oklahoma.
[54:16.000 --> 54:20.000]  Is the President threatening martial law and Congress if they don't pass bills?
[54:20.000 --> 54:22.000]  Is that freedom?
[54:22.000 --> 54:25.000]  Well, certainly the answer to that general question is no.
[54:25.000 --> 54:29.000]  I mean, you obviously cannot engage in that type of activity.
[54:29.000 --> 54:33.000]  We've had periods in our history where we have twisted the Constitution.
[54:33.000 --> 54:35.000]  Well, yeah, Lincoln was a war criminal.
[54:35.000 --> 54:38.000]  There's no doubt about it, but you won't hear anybody say that in the textbooks.
[54:38.000 --> 54:41.000]  And he engaged in all sorts of violations of the Constitution,
[54:41.000 --> 54:45.000]  which he said, I have to do it in the name of freedom, et cetera, et cetera.
[54:45.000 --> 54:51.000]  And we've got to watch very carefully people that use this quote-unquote war on terror
[54:51.000 --> 54:55.000]  as a method to achieve goals that are inappropriate.
[54:55.000 --> 54:57.000]  Well, that's what Obama is saying.
[54:57.000 --> 54:58.000]  He wants to be like Lincoln.
[54:58.000 --> 55:01.000]  And now they're announcing 20,000 troops or more.
[55:01.000 --> 55:06.000]  Have you heard him talk about a million-man domestic security force as big as our army?
[55:06.000 --> 55:10.000]  Yeah, I think that causes me great concern because what do you need it for?
[55:10.000 --> 55:12.000]  You already have the military.
[55:12.000 --> 55:16.000]  The military is under some restrictions as we have the current laws that we deal with.
[55:16.000 --> 55:23.000]  And a state governor would have to request federalization of the state troops.
[55:23.000 --> 55:26.000]  Well, what Gates is saying, sir, and you said you haven't read it yet, please read it today.
[55:26.000 --> 55:30.000]  I know you're a busy guy running a whole department, a whole school, a whole law school.
[55:30.000 --> 55:35.000]  But he says we need to change the law where it's purely federal.
[55:35.000 --> 55:37.000]  Yeah, and I would disagree with that.
[55:37.000 --> 55:38.000]  I would oppose that.
[55:38.000 --> 55:44.000]  You know, as again, someone that's having seen that for the first time, and I've read the summary of it,
[55:44.000 --> 55:48.000]  I'm totally opposed to that degree.
[55:48.000 --> 55:51.000]  I mean, that balance between the Greek security and civil liberties, we're not there yet.
[55:51.000 --> 55:52.000]  I want to tell you something.
[55:52.000 --> 55:53.000]  I'm not a kook.
[55:53.000 --> 55:54.000]  I don't make things up.
[55:54.000 --> 55:58.000]  And I read the 400-page report that they've drawn this out of.
[55:58.000 --> 56:03.000]  And I'm begging you to go read the whole thing, sir, because I think you're going to get more concerned.
[56:03.000 --> 56:05.000]  Well, I'm going to do that.
[56:05.000 --> 56:07.000]  I will certainly do that.
[56:07.000 --> 56:12.000]  But I think it's, you know, as we get into the new administration, they've got some tremendous challenges ahead.
[56:12.000 --> 56:20.000]  We've got an executive that has no military experience, no experience really of any kind in the real world, in my opinion.
[56:20.000 --> 56:25.000]  Now, he better surround himself with people that understand the dangers that we're facing,
[56:25.000 --> 56:29.000]  but also understand the concepts that we need to protect our civil liberties.
[56:29.000 --> 56:33.000]  And I've heard that call about this, you know, the special force of individuals,
[56:33.000 --> 56:37.000]  and that immediately brings to mind, you know, what are these people going to do?
[56:37.000 --> 56:39.000]  Why do you need them?
[56:39.000 --> 56:43.000]  I don't see the threat to the degree that we need to create a special force.
[56:43.000 --> 56:46.000]  A million-person spy force.
[56:46.000 --> 56:50.000]  He had it on his change.gov and pulled it down.
[56:50.000 --> 56:55.000]  I saw that, I saw it when it was up there, and, you know, I'm glad that it's pulled down.
[56:55.000 --> 56:58.000]  I haven't heard anything since then about that issue.
[56:58.000 --> 57:02.000]  Of course, he said many things during the campaign that he has now done a 180 on.
[57:02.000 --> 57:06.000]  Perhaps he was saying these things that many politicians do to acquire a vote.
[57:06.000 --> 57:10.000]  No, the FBI is already setting up these local community tattletale squads.
[57:10.000 --> 57:15.000]  Well, the FBI has a variety of programs that they coordinate with private industry,
[57:15.000 --> 57:19.000]  particularly the cyber world, to do various things, so to the secret service.
[57:19.000 --> 57:22.000]  That's right. That, yeah, exactly.
[57:22.000 --> 57:26.000]  And they told them that was in the news that they're secretly getting ready for martial law.
[57:26.000 --> 57:28.000]  That was in mainstream newspapers.
[57:28.000 --> 57:34.000]  Well, I detailed the role of secret service with business communities in my book on terrorist law in Chapter 8.
[57:34.000 --> 57:37.000]  Well, let's plug that book. We're back in one minute for a final five minutes.
[57:37.000 --> 57:40.000]  And I could tell you, Mr. Attacott, now I'm getting interviewed for a third time.
[57:40.000 --> 57:47.000]  I'm liking you a lot more, and we appreciate you living in reality and actually having concerns on this issue.
[57:47.000 --> 57:49.000]  We'll be right back.
[58:18.000 --> 58:25.000]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[58:25.000 --> 58:31.000]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[58:31.000 --> 58:35.000]  An inside job? How dare you?
[58:35.000 --> 58:41.000]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[58:41.000 --> 58:47.000]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[58:47.000 --> 58:50.000]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of that.
[58:50.000 --> 58:56.000]  Please rise and download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now, or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[58:56.000 --> 59:22.000]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[59:22.000 --> 59:35.000]  AP and Bloomberg reported, as you know, on Tuesday, 8.4 trillion now stolen by the foreign offshore banks has nothing to do with the credit crisis.
[59:35.000 --> 59:37.000]  I'll cover that after Mr. Attacott leaves.
[59:37.000 --> 59:41.000]  We have about four minutes left with him right now in this short segment.
[59:41.000 --> 59:43.000]  And he blew me away during the one minute break.
[59:43.000 --> 59:46.000]  He said he's about to go to Israel to do a big talk on chemical bio attack.
[59:46.000 --> 59:51.000]  And then he said, if Israel doesn't strike in the next month or so,
[59:51.000 --> 59:53.000]  I'll be back to do an interview with you.
[59:53.000 --> 59:55.000]  If not, I won't be coming back.
[59:55.000 --> 59:56.000]  What does that mean?
[59:56.000 --> 1:00:01.000]  Because I have several mainstream articles today out of Israel where they're saying they may go ahead and hit Iran.
[1:00:01.000 --> 1:00:07.000]  The bipartisan commission report that said we're going to have an attack on the homeland by 2013,
[1:00:07.000 --> 1:00:08.000]  they had recommendations.
[1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:16.000]  One of their major recommendations was Iran has to be stopped from acquiring radioactive materials, nuclear weapons, et cetera, et cetera.
[1:00:16.000 --> 1:00:25.000]  And my sources tell me, and I work with the Israelis a lot, that the very latest Iran will have nuclear weapons by 2012 at the latest.
[1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:32.000]  The time to attack a totalitarian regime that is whacked out of their mind is before they get weapons of mass destruction,
[1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:34.000]  not after they get weapons of mass destruction.
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:36.000]  The Israelis know that.
[1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  And that's the challenge for Mr. Obama.
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  It's going to happen on his watch.
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:44.000]  Well, we heard that about Iraq, about WMDs.
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  Well, what we heard about Iraq is that they already had them, that they were in the process of developing.
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:55.000]  If we hadn't went into Iraq in 2003, he would probably have them by today, because that was his goal.
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  He had the Israelis had knocked them out in 81 with his Osterik reactor.
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:00.000]  He had used scud missiles against them.
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:02.000]  But the inspectors had been all over that place.
[1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  They were in the Stone Age.
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:14.000]  But after 9-11, it was not a time for Saddam Hussein to be kicking sand in their eyes and saying, no, I'm kicking all these inspectors out, and you just have to guess whether I got them or not.
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:16.000]  He was not very bright. You don't mess with this after 9-11.
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  If 9-11 happened to happen, we would not have went into Iraq.
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  If we don't have a major attack on the homeland, Mr. Obama will not go.
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  Okay, well, you say you're close to the Israelis.
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  Are you saying, I mean, they're saying in their newspapers, I'm sure you've seen it yesterday and today, but is the word they're getting ready to hit Iran?
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  Well, you know, it depends on who you talk to.
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:36.000]  There's a lot of chatter.
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  Let me just put it that way.
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  But I can tell you from the sources that I know they're very high placed that they believe that Iran will have the weapons by 2012.
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:45.000]  Do you have not going to stop them?
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  Who is going to stop them?
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  And they're threatened by Iran because Iran is quite frankly said, we're going to kill all of you.
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:56.000]  So knowing that, I think it's prudent that they should do something.
[1:01:56.000 --> 1:02:00.000]  Do you sit down and negotiate your way out of this, or do you do what in the real world?
[1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  But you were saying you're going over to Israel for a little while, but you may not be coming.
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  Is the word?
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  I mean, you're hearing there's a good chance, though.
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:08.000]  I mean, specifically what you were saying during the break.
[1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  I'm not, well, I was kind of in jest because, you know, I would not be surprised that the Israelis struck on their own initiative.
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  I'm going over there tomorrow for a few days at a bioterrorism conference.
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  And in jest, I'd say if I come back, because it could happen today.
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  It could happen tomorrow.
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:24.000]  It could happen in the year.
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  But the Israelis have discussed it, they have engaged in war gaming with their Air Force, the entire Air Force last year, as you know, with a war game, essentially a practice run.
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:35.000]  But they're thinking about the issue.
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:37.000]  I mean, that's, they're thinking about it.
[1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  It could very well occur tomorrow or a month from now.
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  Well, why did the last help give nukes to Pakistan?
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:45.000]  It's so bad to have nukes over there.
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:50.000]  Well, you know, that's another story, but essentially, as we were saying, incompetent.
[1:02:50.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  I mean, our intelligence was so bad, we didn't realize the Pakistanis were as far along as they were.
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:56.000]  They lied.
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:02:58.000]  They hid things from us.
[1:02:58.000 --> 1:03:00.000]  And we were totally surprised.
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:05.000]  Really, the world was totally surprised when Pakistan detonated its first nuclear weapon.
[1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:09.000]  But, I mean, Israel's got at least 400 nukes in great delivery systems.
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  I mean, let's say Iran in three years, two years is going to get an A bomb.
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  I mean, they're not going to.
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  Well, deterrence works with rational people.
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  A lot of these jihadists, they want to die.
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:24.000]  I mean, on 7-7 in July, I would take the backpack off and put it on the subway and walk away to fight another day.
[1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  They want to die for jihad.
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  I mean, the 9-11.
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  Professor, when you get back, I want to have you back on, but I'm going to try to send you a lot of material.
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  Because on certain levels, you sound like a good guy on other levels.
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:36.000]  I think you're really believing a lot of what you're saying.
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:40.000]  And I think some of it's true, but I think a lot of it is public relations.
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  And maybe you're drinking the Kool-Aid.
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:44.000]  Maybe you're not.
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  But Professor Jeffrey F. Atticott, thank you for speaking with us.
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  Let me say bye to you.
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  You bet.
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  Let me say bye to you behind the scenes here when we go to break in about five seconds and we'll let you go.
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:04:19.000]  Folks, we'll be back and I'll have comments on all this. Stay with us.
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:27.000]  They turned off the telephones and emailed.
[1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  They voted to print $850 billion at least out of thin air.
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  This money now owns the American and European banks.
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities,
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  particularly food beyond many Americans reach.
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  In pre-Nazi Germany's superinflation, the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days until it reached over 4 billion marks.
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  Food prices are skyrocketing so fast, there seems as if there may be no end in sight.
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:05:00.000]  The private banks, merging with our government, are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves.
[1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:03.000]  The stores have less food, but jack up prices to stay in business.
[1:05:03.000 --> 1:05:06.000]  Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared and be ready.
[1:05:06.000 --> 1:05:08.000]  Everything is zeroing in on food.
[1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:12.000]  One-third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities.
[1:05:12.000 --> 1:05:16.000]  My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared, get self-sufficient, get food.
[1:05:16.000 --> 1:05:21.000]  For everybody out there listening, it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food,
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:28.000]  the government, the new-old order has a lot less control over you, and so it's a mindset, a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness.
[1:05:28.000 --> 1:05:31.000]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:38.000]  You know, efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports,
[1:05:38.000 --> 1:05:41.000]  and they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[1:06:04.000 --> 1:06:05.000]  Take action today.
[1:06:05.000 --> 1:06:07.000]  The first step is getting storable food.
[1:06:07.000 --> 1:06:09.000]  E's the T-Rex of political talk.
[1:06:09.000 --> 1:06:12.000]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:06:19.000 --> 1:06:35.000]  You know, talking to Atacod, he is a mainline conservative Christian who really believes that the Muslims are basically the antichrist that are going to try to start World War 3.
[1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:50.000]  I mean, it's a fact that AQCon Laboratories was aided by Bill Clinton and the Council on Foreign Relations Anglo-American Syndicate to get its nukes to create global crisis in Central Asia.
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:51.000]  And that's on record.
[1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:59.000]  It's on record that the head of ABB, the Swiss company, gave the nuke reactors to build bombs to North Korea.
[1:06:59.000 --> 1:07:06.000]  Why? To escalate crises worldwide so the West has a pretext to go in.
[1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:23.000]  Iran had a moderate government let the UN totally defile their sovereignty, run their entire system, control their entire country to build peaceful nuke reactors, and then the UN and the US went back on their word and said, now you can't even have those.
[1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:29.000]  Iran has had their government overthrown at least twice by the United States and England on record.
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:36.000]  The United States terror attacks there to blame it on the government and overthrow them kind of a verse-false flag.
[1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:38.000]  Just generally, government's doing it to blame it on some group.
[1:07:38.000 --> 1:08:00.000]  This was criminals in our government doing it to blame it on their government and said that the secular Mosaddek was bombing Mosque. Radical Muslims on the record were used by Hitler and then used in the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s and right through to today to overthrow secular regimes or regimes that the West did not like.
[1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:10.000]  And then the bomb makers, the military, the social architects then say, oh now we've got Muslim extremists in there, now we've got to have war with them.
[1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:19.000]  And so the West shoots down repeatedly their jetliners and oh we accidentally blew your jumbo jet full of women and children up.
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:38.000]  And then this year and last year, the White House admitted what we told you five and a half years ago, what New Yorker magazine told you four years ago, but we told you here first, that Wahhabist Sunnis, that's the group out of Saudi Arabia, 80% of the Muslim faith,
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:48.000]  but the Wahhabist is a tiny sect of those, radical, compared to the others, backed up by British intelligence, created by British intelligence, Saudi Arabia was set up by it.
[1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  This is on record in Lawrence of Arabia.
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:09:12.000]  The West spent over $100 million, according to the Washington Post, over a 20 year program, just shipping in US printed textbooks, radicalizing the Muslims in Central Asia, the Sunnis, in Pakistan, in India, in Afghanistan.
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:18.000]  This was, this started in the 60s, so they would have them ready by the 80s.
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:36.000]  I mean, this is a fact, you can't debate this, the next time I have Atticaut on, I'm going to do some pre-research and actually pull up all the articles, all the documents so I can hit them with them, play the, you know, I'd play the clips or I'd mention the document and he would have to admit and say, yeah, I'm against it, it's wrong.
[1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:54.000]  And so I'm going to get him back on air and I'm going to just go through every one of them. Okay, here's the Pentagon giving through the State Department and the Pentagon State Department Program, joint program, over $100 million of textbooks saying kill the infidels, kill the westerners, kill the communists,
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:10:04.000]  the kids learn to count three hand grenades plus two hand grenades equals five, two machine guns plus eight machine guns equals 10 machine guns.
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  I mean, that's what our government, that's how diabolical they are.
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  The Muslims wanted big listening hotels and shopping malls and fashion. They're totally worldly at the core. I mean, look, it's a cradle of civilization over there.
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  And not even saying, oh, that's a good thing. The point is they want rock and roll and playboy.
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  But the West doesn't want them on their own two feet. It's in the Royal Commission on Population 44 to 49, put up with the British government.
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  How do they stabilize nations, radical, put radical groups in control, overthrow legitimate governments, destabilize, then they say we can go in and counter them afterwards.
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:11:04.000]  See how that works? Don't let nations industrialize, fund their neighbors, fund inner religious and inner sect and inner regional wars.
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:10.000]  This is the great game. This is what the global elite do. This is how they control people.
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  But here, in the name of multiculturalism, all they hype up is our differences. And then the name of fighting that, all they do is make people be obsessed with it so we can't live in peace.
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  Men against women, women against men, black against white, white against Hispanic, Hispanic against white, Catholic against Protestant, on and on and on and on, divide and conquer.
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:44.000]  And then they take what Ahmed Denizide, who I'm no fan of, has said, because he has incendiary rhetoric for his population.
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  They take what he says and he says, if you attack us, we will push the Zionist regime into the sea.
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  And this has been mainstream news. They falsified this. They say, I will destroy. We will nuke Israel. We will blow you off the map.
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  When in every case, the West says, we are going to use nukes on you.
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:17.000]  We're going to attack you. They'll put out a report saying we're going to bomb with more than 10,000 Saudis to 10,000 attacks with aircraft.
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:24.000]  And they say, OK, well, if you do that, we're going to sink ships in the Strait of Hormuz. We're going to attack your aircraft carriers.
[1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  We've got 11,000 long-range missiles. We're going to blow the Zionist regime off the map.
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  We're going to push the Zionist regime into the sea.
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:40.000]  I mean, I don't want to be sucked into all this tribalism and sectarianism. I want everybody to live in peace.
[1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:46.000]  But that's not what's happening. I was talking to Attica during the break, but he had to go teach a class.
[1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:55.000]  He's the head of that terrorism law school down there. And he was breathing hard going, I'm going to tell you about the Muslims.
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  They're going to attack us. It's all real. It's about to happen. And Israel's got to go into Iran.
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:05.000]  And when they do go into Iran, it's going to be hell. It's going to break down everywhere.
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:10.000]  It's going to be war everywhere. There's going to be terrorism everywhere. Exactly.
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:17.000]  If the globalists attack Iran, folks, there are going to be real Shiite terror cells attacking all over the West.
[1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:22.000]  And then the globalists will stage big events and say that they're doing that as well.
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:30.000]  Now, we don't call it terrorism, but in the Cold War, the United States had sleeper cells, special forces, all over Europe,
[1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:36.000]  all over Latin America, all over Africa, all over the Soviet Union.
[1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:42.000]  The reports are they even smuggled nukes into these countries.
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:52.000]  The Russians got the decapitation teams into here. This is what governments do.
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:59.000]  And I just report what the facts show, what the facts say, what the facts clearly reveal.
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  We came up here last week on Tuesday Show that went live again on Friday. We were saying, we don't know if this is government sponsored.
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:18.000]  We said Pakistan has no Kibono, no motive. Pakistan is begging, saying they didn't do it. They're investigating.
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:24.000]  Pakistan has the very same militants that India's claiming doing this.
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  The Wahhabist inside their country created by the United States, attacking them, the same groups trying to kill them every week,
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  bombing government buildings, killing government officials. I mean, it's real. They're killing them because they're trying to kick them out.
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  And the Pakistanis are saying this is English, British, US, and Israeli controlled. We want them out.
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:50.000]  So we looked at the evidence. We watched it closely.
[1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:57.000]  And now it's in the times of India today. And this could be a setup, too. When you get a coke and dagger, it's hard to know the truth.
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:15:04.000]  They were wearing Hindu Zionists. There's a huge subset of Hindu Zionist wristbands.
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:09.000]  They were on LSD, cocaine, and in fediments.
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:17.000]  And the head of India's anti-terror force had been in the newspaper saying elements of our own government in the radical Hindu group,
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:24.000]  the same ones that killed Mahatma Gandhi. He was a Hindu, but he wouldn't go along with them in a war against Muslims.
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  They're the ones that killed Gandhi.
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:35.000]  So the head of the anti-terror force, who himself as a Hindu, went in the newspapers two weeks ago.
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  We have these up on prisonplanet.com right now. And he said our government just bombed the train station.
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:48.000]  It costed an army captain for doing it. A Hindu army captain. He was getting death threats. And as soon as he went in the hotel,
[1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:53.000]  at point blank range, the evidence now shows some of his own men killed him.
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:59.000]  And that's why this is in the newspapers in India, the biggest ones.
[1:15:59.000 --> 1:16:13.000]  And then that's why the Indian police wouldn't fire back as the, quote, terrorists would walk 50 yards right in front of them.
[1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:21.000]  So see, all the evidence now shows this is a Western intelligence operation with Israel running.
[1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:31.000]  We weren't sure if it was an inside job last week. Then we weren't sure if it was British U.S. or Israeli. Now it has Israeli fingerprints all over it.
[1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:39.000]  And we just report the facts. We just report the facts here.
[1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:52.000]  And I don't like getting in the middle of Muslim Serb, Croat Serb, Shiite, Sunni, Hindu, Muslim. It's tribal warfare. All these sides are wrong.
[1:16:52.000 --> 1:17:02.000]  But the globalist manipulate and play all these sides off against each other.
[1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:11.000]  All the police that were killed in India were killed in suspicious circumstances away from the main combat areas and were killed execution style.
[1:17:11.000 --> 1:17:17.000]  It was all anti-terror heads that had busted the Indian army staging terror.
[1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:20.000]  Blowing up a train a few months ago, killing 63.
[1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:27.000]  Was it 65? Go pull it up.
[1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:36.000]  And now the Pakistani government is basically officially saying, look, our intelligence agency was set up by the British and the U.S.
[1:17:36.000 --> 1:17:45.000]  They're trying to kill us. The West is trying to overthrow our government and they're staging terror attacks in India as a pretext to invade us.
[1:17:45.000 --> 1:17:52.000]  Please, we're not with the terrorists. Help us kick the Wahhabist out of here.
[1:17:52.000 --> 1:17:59.000]  You understand? And if you are a Sunni Muslim, I'm not attacking you either.
[1:17:59.000 --> 1:18:05.000]  The point is they're manipulating all these groups so they can't have World War III.
[1:18:05.000 --> 1:18:09.000]  This is the great game. Divide and conquer. We've got to get above all the names.
[1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:14.000]  The headlines are clear. The worldwide economic collapse is here.
[1:18:14.000 --> 1:18:17.000]  The military is being positioned for martial law.
[1:18:17.000 --> 1:18:22.000]  The mark of the beast is at hand. Governments are calling for a new world cashless economic system.
[1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:25.000]  Having a long-term food solution is your only hope.

[1:19:16.000 --> 1:19:18.000]  The reflection blinded our camera.

[1:21:53.000 --> 1:22:00.000]  Order your FOFA today with batteries included along with a 30 day money back guarantee call 866-245-8670.

[1:22:05.000 --> 1:22:07.000]  Again that's FindOneFindAll.com.
[1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:14.000]  There's a man going round taking names.
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:18.000]  And he decides who to free and who to blame.
[1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:23.000]  Everybody won't be treated all the same.
[1:22:23.000 --> 1:22:28.000]  There'll be a golden ladder reaching down.
[1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:40.000]  You know I talk about Zionist Hindus, people are like what?
[1:22:40.000 --> 1:22:43.000]  Oh yeah that's a huge sect over there.
[1:22:43.000 --> 1:22:47.000]  Like you're Zionist Christians, it's the biggest group of Christians in the United States.
[1:22:47.000 --> 1:22:50.000]  The hairs on your arm will stand up.
[1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:55.000]  We've got social engineers that are Luciferians at the top that are globalists.
[1:22:55.000 --> 1:22:58.000]  And that is their religion, I studied them.
[1:22:58.000 --> 1:23:02.000]  Who play us all off against each other.
[1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:05.000]  Bob Chapman's coming up in about 10 minutes.
[1:23:05.000 --> 1:23:08.000]  I wanted to get into some of the other news.
[1:23:08.000 --> 1:23:12.000]  Here's how they're going to sell us having trips on the streets of America.
[1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:14.000]  Now they've been setting us all up covertly.
[1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:17.000]  Now exactly as we told you it's been announced.
[1:23:17.000 --> 1:23:24.000]  We're only going off their own documents and I told you they would sell it as putting a few thousand of the 20,000 regular army trips on the board.
[1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:27.000]  They've already done that with the National Guard.
[1:23:27.000 --> 1:23:29.000]  They don't allow them to have rifles.
[1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:40.000]  They get chased scores of times shot at, shot running from Mexican troops that come in some cases three, four, five miles up at the border.
[1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:44.000]  But they tell the public, oh the National Guard's now on the border.
[1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:46.000]  They claim they're going to build a thousand mile fence.
[1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:48.000]  They build 50 miles up.
[1:23:48.000 --> 1:23:51.000]  Last time I checked it was what 54 miles of them built.
[1:23:51.000 --> 1:23:54.000]  And they used illegal aliens to build it.
[1:23:54.000 --> 1:23:56.000]  You can Google the video or the photos of the new fence.
[1:23:56.000 --> 1:23:57.000]  It's already falling down.
[1:23:57.000 --> 1:24:00.000]  It's a joke.
[1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:05.000]  They put water pipes and ditches in it four feet tall for the people to crawl through.
[1:24:05.000 --> 1:24:11.000]  They put openings in it for the animals to quote be able to migrate under environmental rules.
[1:24:11.000 --> 1:24:13.000]  It's all fake.
[1:24:13.000 --> 1:24:15.000]  And it's the same thing here.
[1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:16.000]  It's public relations.
[1:24:16.000 --> 1:24:22.000]  The U.S. troops may be deployed in Arizona, Southwest U.S.
[1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:28.000]  Phoenix Business Journal, U.S. Defense Department plans to deploy as many 20,000 U.S. troops within the U.S.
[1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:38.000]  for Homeland Security Antiterrorism efforts could result in a significant number being placed in having some kind of presence in Arizona and the Southwest according to security experts.
[1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:51.000]  They're acclimating the public this week in Arizona with foreign troops from all over the world, from more than 10 countries, Germany, England, Czechoslovakia, just on and on and on.
[1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:54.000]  They're doing takeover drills in Arizona.
[1:24:54.000 --> 1:24:55.000]  Google it.
[1:24:55.000 --> 1:24:57.000]  It was in the major newspapers.
[1:24:57.000 --> 1:24:59.000]  What was in the Tucson Star?
[1:24:59.000 --> 1:25:01.000]  The Daily Star.
[1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:04.000]  What a couple weeks ago.
[1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:06.000]  So see, everywhere you're going to hear this propaganda.
[1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:08.000]  Oh, the Army's here to help at Carrex.
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:11.000]  They say that's in their plan for PR.
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:12.000]  Well, why aren't you for the Army?
[1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:14.000]  They're just here at Carrex.
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:16.000]  They're here to helicopter out people hurting Carrex.
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:19.000]  They're here to cut people out of cars.
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:21.000]  Oh, they're here to help your local bomb squad.
[1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:26.000]  You know, go see a cardboard box downtown that fell out of a truck as a bomb.
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:28.000]  That's why they're giving IED.
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:37.000]  You know, roadside improvised explosive device training to every police department in the country has been given federal grants to have the feds come in.
[1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:43.000]  Oh, hi, we're the Army here to work with you because there's going to be terrorists everywhere with roadside bombs.
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:50.000]  But then when you really read what it's set up for, it's set up to suppress the American people.
[1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:57.000]  And Atacot, one of the senior experts on the inside of all this, admitted, he said, yes, it's for the American people.
[1:25:57.000 --> 1:25:59.000]  But he said, I know it's unconstitutional.
[1:25:59.000 --> 1:26:01.000]  I know it's bad.
[1:26:01.000 --> 1:26:04.000]  But Al-Qaeda, Al-Qaeda is going to get us, Alex.
[1:26:04.000 --> 1:26:07.000]  He was talking to me during breaks going, don't you understand how deadly they are?
[1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:09.000]  Don't you understand how real they are?
[1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:11.000]  And I didn't even argue with him.
[1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:15.000]  I'm going to have him back on and have all the mainstream news articles and WhiteHouse.gov.
[1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:17.000]  Because he'll try to deny the media.
[1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:19.000]  WhiteHouse.gov admitted last year.
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:26.000]  Remember, I made a big deal out of it saying, oh, yes, we have hired these four groups to fight
[1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:31.000]  the insurgency on the Iranian border in eastern Iraq, western Iran.
[1:26:31.000 --> 1:26:37.000]  And we are funding them to carry out liberation movements inside Iran.
[1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:43.000]  The White House threw the gauntlet down to get Iran to shoot their mouths off again,
[1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:52.000]  and said, we are attacking Iran with, and he listed the four groups,
[1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:57.000]  the three of them were Wahhabist groups, and the main group, the mainstream news reported,
[1:26:57.000 --> 1:27:02.000]  was commanded by the number three in the FBI's list of the Al-Qaeda hierarchy.
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:09.000]  And then Jeffery Atacot comes on here and tells me that we're fighting Al-Qaeda.
[1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:12.000]  Funny, they used Al-Qaeda to attack the Serbs.
[1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:14.000]  They used Al-Qaeda to attack the Russians.
[1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:17.000]  They used Al-Qaeda to attack Iran.
[1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:20.000]  He's told me during the book, he goes, but Iran will give a nuke to Al-Qaeda.
[1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:30.000]  He's a Shiite. Shiites and Sunnis hate each other more than they supposedly don't like Christians.
[1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:33.000]  I mean, maybe Jeffery Atacot doesn't know that.
[1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:36.000]  Maybe he doesn't really study this.
[1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:39.000]  But every point I made to him, he had to admit was true.
[1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:43.000]  I don't make anything up.
[1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:47.000]  So I'm sorry, this isn't cut and dry, simple black and white folks for you.
[1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:50.000]  This is globalist intelligence operation against free humanity.
[1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:53.000]  Whether you're a Christian, a Jew, a Muslim, it doesn't matter.
[1:27:53.000 --> 1:28:19.000]  Whether you're an animus, they're coming after you.
[1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:26.000]  We carry this on our minds, bottom line, pretty high quality products
[1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:30.000]  that produce and distill water without use of animal protein, nitrates or saline solutions
[1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:33.000]  because our colloidal silver is made up of nano sized particles.
[1:28:33.000 --> 1:28:38.000]  It could be better utilized at the cellular level and germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern-day antibiotics.
[1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:45.000]  Utopia silver has a broad range of health supplements, including colloidal silver, gold and copper,
[1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:49.000]  with a money-缬 guarantee on the colloidal products we produce.
[1:28:49.000 --> 1:28:53.880]  fighting in the Texas courts against agencies that would steal our God-given rights of health care
[1:28:53.880 --> 1:29:06.760]  and freedom of speech. Visit us today at utopiasilver.com that's utopiasilver.com or call 888-213-4338 888-213-4338
[1:29:06.760 --> 1:29:11.800]  and help us win this battle. A day unlike any other in the long course of American history,
[1:29:11.800 --> 1:29:17.320]  a terrorist act of war against this country. The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[1:29:17.320 --> 1:29:19.320]  But who is the enemy?
[1:29:19.320 --> 1:29:21.320]  bin Laden. This is his ammo.
[1:29:21.320 --> 1:29:24.680]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[1:29:24.680 --> 1:29:29.480]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[1:29:29.480 --> 1:29:34.280]  networks inside the United States. Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis
[1:29:34.280 --> 1:29:41.640]  again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been
[1:29:41.640 --> 1:29:47.160]  detained. Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian
[1:29:47.160 --> 1:29:51.400]  connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government,
[1:29:51.400 --> 1:29:58.040]  and much, much more. Fabled Enemies, get the DVD at infowars.com or see it in super high quality
[1:29:58.040 --> 1:30:04.440]  along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv. Either you are with us or you are with the
[1:30:04.440 --> 1:30:12.440]  terrorists.
[1:30:35.240 --> 1:30:39.640]  People are telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much
[1:30:39.640 --> 1:30:42.440]  healthier I feel. I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[1:30:42.440 --> 1:30:48.440]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative
[1:30:48.440 --> 1:30:50.440]  to keep their cardio-vascular system healthy.

[1:31:28.440 --> 1:31:34.440]  Thank you for joining us in the next hour with his wife, Dr. Lebo, for a extended interview with us.
[1:31:34.440 --> 1:31:36.440]  We had her on briefly earlier in the week.
[1:31:36.440 --> 1:31:44.440]  Talking about Codex Alimentarius, GMO Foods, the mass eugenics program going on worldwide against free humanity.
[1:31:44.440 --> 1:31:52.440]  So that is coming up. Before we go to Bob Chapman for a brief 30-minute interview on the economy today,
[1:31:52.440 --> 1:32:01.440]  I am hardly even plugging books and videos and films that I've made or I carry at infowars.com on the online video and bookstore these days.
[1:32:01.440 --> 1:32:06.440]  I'm so busy discovering the news, but these are such an important part of the fight, waking people up.
[1:32:06.440 --> 1:32:17.440]  The population is more ready, more apt, more conducive to reaching out and educating people right now.
[1:32:17.440 --> 1:32:23.440]  The minds are very fertile right now to wake up to what the New World Order is doing, to wake up to what they're engaged in,
[1:32:23.440 --> 1:32:32.440]  to understand the fact that there's this overarching global technocracy that's in control.
[1:32:32.440 --> 1:32:39.440]  And so please, this Christmas season, this holiday season, don't procrastinate.
[1:32:39.440 --> 1:32:48.440]  Don't go fight the malls and the traffic and buy the fruitcakes or the ties or the robot toys that break in five minutes that nobody wants.
[1:32:48.440 --> 1:32:55.440]  Make Christmas cards for people. But bake fudge. Make fudge. It's fun stuff. It's family.
[1:32:55.440 --> 1:33:00.440]  Go out in local woods and cut some berries and holly and stuff and put that in your house.
[1:33:00.440 --> 1:33:04.440]  That's what I did with my children.
[1:33:04.440 --> 1:33:09.440]  I mean, we have more depression, more suicides, people going to debt at Christmas. Just don't do it.
[1:33:09.440 --> 1:33:16.440]  Get back to basics. But if you're going to go spend money, why not give the gift of reality, the gift of truth, the gift of information,
[1:33:16.440 --> 1:33:20.440]  the gift of awakening, unlocking minds?
[1:33:20.440 --> 1:33:26.440]  And the best place to do that is infowars.com. You can get all the DVDs, the books, the film.
[1:33:26.440 --> 1:33:35.440]  Game, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, Terror, Storm, History, Government Sponsored Terror, my two best made most powerful films, in my opinion,
[1:33:35.440 --> 1:33:43.440]  on overall information about the New World Order, the master plan, truth rising, just incredible activism and adventure.
[1:33:43.440 --> 1:33:47.440]  I mean, it's a great watch, not just powerful info.
[1:33:47.440 --> 1:33:55.440]  Just go to infowars.com and order the books and DVDs. If you're in international orders, if you are outside North America,
[1:33:55.440 --> 1:34:03.440]  you need to get your orders in by tomorrow to be guaranteed to get it well before Christmas.
[1:34:03.440 --> 1:34:11.440]  And if you're going to be ordering to get it before Christmas here in the United States, guaranteed, with the UPS we use, ground,
[1:34:11.440 --> 1:34:14.440]  you need to order by the 17th.
[1:34:14.440 --> 1:34:21.440]  So time is running out and I can think of no better gift than a Terror, Storm, or an in-game, beautiful packaging.
[1:34:21.440 --> 1:34:31.440]  It reads like an adventure movie on the back. That's good to get people to watch it, well produced, slickly done, key information.
[1:34:31.440 --> 1:34:38.440]  But I don't care if you take my films like in-game or Terror, Storm, or Truth Rising and just make copies of them for stocking stuffers.
[1:34:38.440 --> 1:34:45.440]  I just want people to have this information, but they're more apt to watch it if it's an original.
[1:34:45.440 --> 1:34:53.440]  So big discounts, you get my films as low as like five bucks a piece when you buy them in bulk at infowars.com or call toll free
[1:34:53.440 --> 1:35:04.440]  and ask them about the combos and specials 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[1:35:04.440 --> 1:35:13.440]  And the best deal of this Christmas season this holiday, and I don't care if you're not a Christian, still gives somebody the gift of truth,
[1:35:13.440 --> 1:35:21.440]  get a PrismPlanet.tv, all 20 of my films, hundreds and hundreds of weekly TV reports, special reports on every issue,
[1:35:21.440 --> 1:35:29.440]  from health to martial law to the police state to the CPS, get a PrismPlanet.tv membership, peruse through the thousands of videos and audios,
[1:35:29.440 --> 1:35:37.440]  four and a half years up and running, it's now in super high quality, delivered by high-powered servers, always quick, easy, fast,
[1:35:37.440 --> 1:35:46.440]  takes a minute to sign up, $5.95 a month, get a passcode, your username and passcode, and you can share that with three or four people in your family,
[1:35:46.440 --> 1:35:56.440]  put it in a card, say, hey, I gave you a membership to a really cool movie site, it's PrismPlanet.tv, and here's your passcode and username,
[1:35:56.440 --> 1:36:01.440]  make it simple, make it easy, make it holiday name, make it freedom name, whatever, and give it to them,
[1:36:01.440 --> 1:36:08.440]  and then even if they on the off chance weren't going to use it, most of them will, you've got a membership, give yourself a membership,
[1:36:08.440 --> 1:36:15.440]  give us a little bit of cash, be able to operate and expand and continue what we're doing, especially in these hard times, it's hard on everybody,
[1:36:15.440 --> 1:36:22.440]  and give the gift of knowledge and information, so PrismPlanet.tv, tell you something else that's good to give,
[1:36:22.440 --> 1:36:29.440]  give somebody the International Forecaster, go to theinternationalforecaster.com and do that as well, because it's an info war,
[1:36:29.440 --> 1:36:38.440]  and some people, you know, in COINTELPRO from the 60s and 70s declassified FBI program, how would they criticize activist groups,
[1:36:38.440 --> 1:36:47.440]  second amendment groups, black liberation groups, environmental rights groups, Native American groups, anybody who tried to write books,
[1:36:47.440 --> 1:36:54.440]  make documentaries, start a newsletter, they would criticize them and put agents into their midst and say, you're making money, you're not supposed to,
[1:36:54.440 --> 1:37:02.440]  let me make it clear for everybody, it's good to make money, it's good, we need to have nice offices and cameras and equipment
[1:37:02.440 --> 1:37:09.440]  and be able to fly people in and do interviews and bring you better, slicker information, I mean what a joke,
[1:37:09.440 --> 1:37:18.440]  the mainstream media, the government takes our money, uses it against us, takes our money and taxes, uses it as propaganda against the public,
[1:37:18.440 --> 1:37:28.440]  and then has the nerve to tell us that we shouldn't have websites, that we shouldn't have advertisers, that we shouldn't be able to fight the new world order.
[1:37:28.440 --> 1:37:34.440]  What matters is the information we're putting out, so I'm going to tell you, I want you to buy the books, the videos, I've never really asked for this in the past,
[1:37:34.440 --> 1:37:41.440]  but it's helped us grow so much since we finally did it, that if you want to just give us donations, write it to Alex Jones,
[1:37:41.440 --> 1:37:49.440]  and I assure you 90% of it will be spent in the fight, and the other 10% will be spent in the fight as well,
[1:37:49.440 --> 1:37:56.440]  for the t-shirt on my back, the shoes on my feet and food for my children, because I do this full time because I have the capital to do it,
[1:37:56.440 --> 1:38:04.440]  and I will hire more people, I will hire high caliber people, we will do even better, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:38:04.440 --> 1:38:11.440]  so it's a mind game that they've trained us that we can't have organizations, I mean it's ridiculous, of course we have to have funds,
[1:38:11.440 --> 1:38:19.440]  of course we do, that's ridiculous, we're supposed to sit down under a bridge yelling at cars as they drive by,
[1:38:19.440 --> 1:38:24.440]  no, we're moving out, we're fighting the new world order, we're trying to win, we've got winners' attitudes,

[1:38:52.440 --> 1:39:08.440]  I think overall it's another governmental U.S. missile operation.

[1:39:25.440 --> 1:39:29.440]  Bob Chapman, the international forecaster, really needs no introduction here, but you can read his bio.
[1:39:29.440 --> 1:39:48.440]  It's another governmental U.S. missile operation, but I quite frankly don't have enough information to intelligently say-
[1:39:48.440 --> 1:39:48.440]  Well, just to be clear, you were in intelligence for a long time, and you're right, it's now come out, the Indian government times of India,
[1:39:48.440 --> 1:40:00.440]  the Pakistani government is saying they staged an attack with Hindu Zionists, they killed the anti-terror chiefs who just busted the Indian army, staging terror attacks on a bus station a few months ago,
[1:40:00.440 --> 1:40:12.440]  that was in mainstream news, so they targeted, killed, you notice all these guys that died were terrorism chiefs, so they wiped them out, and it clearly now was a staged event.
[1:40:12.440 --> 1:40:25.440]  Well, that's to be expected, and what the end result, probably just a method of keeping people's eye off of more important things that are going on,
[1:40:25.440 --> 1:40:35.440]  just to start off with, the whole world is sinking into severe recession, and it's just not the United States and Europe,
[1:40:35.440 --> 1:40:49.440]  this whole world's going to the Chinese and devaluing their currency by about 7% again. I mean, we have got to institute trade tariffs on everything,
[1:40:49.440 --> 1:41:02.440]  and that means goods and services, these countries continue to denigrate their currency so that they can ship competitive or cheap goods to the United States.
[1:41:02.440 --> 1:41:09.440]  I mean, the Mexican peso just went down from 9.30 to almost 14.
[1:41:09.440 --> 1:41:19.440]  Well, let's explain this, they call it free and fair trade, but no environmental standards, you know, a dollar an hour or less in China, and their currency's way under ours,
[1:41:19.440 --> 1:41:27.440]  there's no way to compete with that, and so tariffs are what built this country until we got rid of them in the last 50 years or so,
[1:41:27.440 --> 1:41:32.440]  but shifting gears, let's get back into that, but we only have a little bit of time with you Bob, so I want to give you quick questions, quick answers.
[1:41:32.440 --> 1:41:42.440]  Bloomberg and AP are reporting now, 8.4 trillion stolen by the bankers, but the bankers are just giving cash totals, they're not saying where it's going,
[1:41:42.440 --> 1:41:48.440]  so 8.4 trillion in seven weeks Bob, what is that going to do?
[1:41:48.440 --> 1:42:01.440]  It's going to keep the banks, the insurance companies, the brokerage firms, the equity people, and special situations like the automobile industry,
[1:42:01.440 --> 1:42:13.440]  a general electric, it's going to keep them alive for a while, and what they're doing is borrowing time evidently now is not the time to bring the whole thing down and collapse it.
[1:42:13.440 --> 1:42:24.440]  It's obviously some date in the future, but what I see is you know, two and a half months ago we projected 10 trillion plus, everybody else is just catching up,
[1:42:24.440 --> 1:42:31.440]  and now I look at it at the rate they're going, they may be looking at 20 trillion, it is just unbelievable,
[1:42:31.440 --> 1:42:39.440]  and today they've recommended another trillion dollars to kickstart the economy.
[1:42:39.440 --> 1:42:49.440]  This is going to blow inflation right through the roof, because that's far more than you need to offset the inherent asset deflation that's going on,
[1:42:49.440 --> 1:42:56.440]  and so inflation is going to go crazy, starting probably about February, March, April, again.
[1:42:56.440 --> 1:43:02.440]  I mean it's already at 12.5%, we're looking at going over 20%.
[1:43:02.440 --> 1:43:12.440]  Unbelievable, they're being so secretive, I mean imagine, 8.4 trillion stolen in right under seven weeks,
[1:43:12.440 --> 1:43:19.440]  and then now Bob, they've announced what we've already knew, total abolishment of the National Guard under federal control,
[1:43:19.440 --> 1:43:24.440]  the governors will serve at the pleasure of the president, troops on the streets of America.
[1:43:24.440 --> 1:43:30.440]  Yes, I reported on the Wednesday issue, and one of the things that came out with a week or two ago,
[1:43:30.440 --> 1:43:39.440]  and I really, it didn't dent my head as to how important it was, but we're looking at another bubble.
[1:43:39.440 --> 1:43:49.440]  Now the bubble is beginning, it began perhaps about six months ago, FHA, these are the loans that are given by government
[1:43:49.440 --> 1:43:55.440]  for people who want to borrow, either stay in their homes or get new homes.
[1:43:55.440 --> 1:44:00.440]  They have $300 billion, they'll go through that lickety-split.
[1:44:00.440 --> 1:44:09.440]  Now the people who are placing these loans, the loan originators, are the same gang,
[1:44:09.440 --> 1:44:18.440]  35,000 of them, that have licenses now to do this with the FHA, to write these loans,
[1:44:18.440 --> 1:44:29.440]  this is the same gang that wrote the subprime loans and the altar loans, light on the applications, forge the application.
[1:44:29.440 --> 1:44:37.440]  Well look at who Obama's bringing in, I mean as bad as Bush was, the economic team of Obama is the exact people that got rid
[1:44:37.440 --> 1:44:42.440]  of the Glass-Steagall Act and actually set all this up in the 90s.
[1:44:42.440 --> 1:44:49.440]  That's right, and so what's going to happen is that they're going to continue to increase the money,
[1:44:49.440 --> 1:44:56.440]  Congress will, that they give to the FHA, and they're going to give all these loans out to people again,
[1:44:56.440 --> 1:45:03.440]  who should not have them, and two years from now, three years from now, we're going to have another problem
[1:45:03.440 --> 1:45:07.440]  like we just had over the last two years with those two kinds of loans.
[1:45:07.440 --> 1:45:14.440]  Let's be clear. Many of the people, Alex, many of them who are writing these loans,
[1:45:14.440 --> 1:45:21.440]  have criminal records in that field, and the government doesn't want to know about it,
[1:45:21.440 --> 1:45:28.440]  they just want people to either stay in homes or buy new homes to temporary solve the problem, they don't care.
[1:45:28.440 --> 1:45:32.440]  But let's explain, it's not just that these loans are going to go bad,
[1:45:32.440 --> 1:45:37.440]  it's that they're leveraging and securitizing them, they're selling the debt.
[1:45:37.440 --> 1:45:45.440]  Again, and the US government is buying it, and it's 100% insured and guaranteed by the American taxpayer.
[1:45:45.440 --> 1:45:49.440]  And that means the leveraging is guaranteed.
[1:45:49.440 --> 1:45:57.440]  Incidentally, I am the only writer that I've read, and I do over 350 pieces of research a day.
[1:45:57.440 --> 1:46:02.440]  In fact, I fall asleep at 7.30 and 8 o'clock at night and get up at 3 in the morning.
[1:46:02.440 --> 1:46:08.440]  And I have seen nobody else come out with that, and it was so simple.
[1:46:08.440 --> 1:46:11.440]  No, I understand. There's all sorts of little bubble scams going.
[1:46:11.440 --> 1:46:16.440]  Well, they're using the bailout money to go start new bubble leveraging operations.
[1:46:16.440 --> 1:46:19.440]  And that's for sure. That's in the banking and the brokerage community.
[1:46:19.440 --> 1:46:20.440]  Okay, now.
[1:46:20.440 --> 1:46:28.440]  I mean, there was this one firm that just received a mutual fund firm, just received $2 billion, so they're laying off people.
[1:46:28.440 --> 1:46:29.440]  Yeah, I want to shift gears.
[1:46:29.440 --> 1:46:30.440]  That'll be a saddy's issue.
[1:46:30.440 --> 1:46:34.440]  I want to shift gears because, yeah, they implode the economy, then they become flesh with cash,
[1:46:34.440 --> 1:46:39.440]  and they leverage it in derivatives, again, to dominate and buy everything up,
[1:46:39.440 --> 1:46:43.440]  leveraged, leaving us holding the bag when that new bubble implodes,
[1:46:43.440 --> 1:46:46.440]  then they'll terrorize us into more bailouts then.
[1:46:46.440 --> 1:46:49.440]  But stop right there about us. We don't have a lot of time, and I want to get to this.
[1:46:49.440 --> 1:46:57.440]  I have police, firemen, school teachers, they're being told that they've lost 30, 40, 50% of their 401Ks and investments.
[1:46:57.440 --> 1:47:04.440]  The government's now talking about taking that over to, quote, save it, but then taxing it and then only sending you a smaller amount.
[1:47:04.440 --> 1:47:14.440]  And we've got Harvard saying, you know, they've lost $8 billion out of their pension funds. Where is this going?
[1:47:14.440 --> 1:47:21.440]  Well, I hope nowhere, but there has been people who have spoken before Congress,
[1:47:21.440 --> 1:47:27.440]  promulgating, creating ideas which are exactly what you've said,
[1:47:27.440 --> 1:47:31.440]  and whether Congress will act upon that in that way, I don't know.
[1:47:31.440 --> 1:47:36.440]  But I want to tell you one thing, if they make moves in that direction,
[1:47:36.440 --> 1:47:44.440]  all of you who can want to liquidate your IRAs and your 401Ks and so on and so forth,
[1:47:44.440 --> 1:47:49.440]  there are some retirement plans you can't liquidate without losing your job,
[1:47:49.440 --> 1:47:56.440]  but we even see people quitting their job just to get a hold of their 401Ks because they've lost so much money.
[1:47:56.440 --> 1:48:02.440]  And the stock market is going to continue to go down, irrespective of the manipulation that's going on.
[1:48:02.440 --> 1:48:06.440]  Okay, when are they going to lose it? When are they going to know when to get out of their retirement plans?
[1:48:06.440 --> 1:48:08.440]  I will know, believe me.
[1:48:08.440 --> 1:48:14.440]  Well, I mean, they're already being decimated. What's going to happen to the retirement?
[1:48:14.440 --> 1:48:23.440]  Continue decimation unless they get into gold and silver related assets.
[1:48:23.440 --> 1:48:30.440]  I mean, some people have moved the money market funds and some people have gold and silver mutual funds available to them.
[1:48:30.440 --> 1:48:34.440]  Some people can buy gold and silver coins. It all depends on the plan.
[1:48:34.440 --> 1:48:42.440]  And that's why when I help people, I say, look, you've got to email me and give me my phone number because I've got to talk to you.
[1:48:42.440 --> 1:48:48.440]  I can't put you into something or tell you what to do when it's unsuitable for you.
[1:48:48.440 --> 1:48:51.440]  What's good for Alex is not good for Bob.
[1:48:51.440 --> 1:48:54.440]  And what's good for Sally isn't good for Dave necessarily.
[1:48:54.440 --> 1:48:56.440]  That's right.
[1:48:56.440 --> 1:49:00.440]  Final segment with Bob Chapman straight ahead.
[1:49:00.440 --> 1:49:03.440]  The designed implosion is going quite well for the bankers.
[1:49:03.440 --> 1:49:10.440]  Seven weeks in, 8.4 trillion and counting a couple hundred billion a day.
[1:49:10.440 --> 1:49:13.440]  The holidays are right around the corner.
[1:49:13.440 --> 1:49:20.440]  The crowds, the countless hours in traffic, finding a parking spot just to buy a gift you're worried they might not like anyway.

[1:50:09.440 --> 1:50:17.440]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to grounds here and we knew what to do.
[1:50:17.440 --> 1:50:18.440]  Or at least we thought we did.
[1:50:18.440 --> 1:50:25.440]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[1:50:25.440 --> 1:50:34.440]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[1:50:34.440 --> 1:50:41.440]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[1:50:41.440 --> 1:50:44.440]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[1:50:44.440 --> 1:50:50.440]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

[1:52:54.440 --> 1:52:56.440]  We will never surrender.
[1:52:56.440 --> 1:53:01.440]  Bob Chapman, the good news is the people are really waking up because you and I and many others,
[1:53:01.440 --> 1:53:06.440]  you going back 45 years, folks don't know he's one of the grandaddies of the Patriot movement,
[1:53:06.440 --> 1:53:08.440]  the old guard that really got everything going.
[1:53:08.440 --> 1:53:12.440]  Everything we've said has come true about the military, the troops, the stage terror,
[1:53:12.440 --> 1:53:15.440]  the banker stealing openly announcing world government.
[1:53:15.440 --> 1:53:18.440]  So right now, people are ready to listen to us.
[1:53:18.440 --> 1:53:22.440]  We need the folks out there to become leaders and take action, Bob.
[1:53:22.440 --> 1:53:24.440]  Absolutely.
[1:53:24.440 --> 1:53:30.440]  And we need more people coming on the air and doing programs like this and writing publications
[1:53:30.440 --> 1:53:32.440]  and expose what's going on.
[1:53:32.440 --> 1:53:38.440]  All too many of the people who are writing are afraid to go to the heart of the problem.
[1:53:38.440 --> 1:53:49.440]  They're afraid to name the alumnus and the Zionists and these phony events that they have such as we just saw in Mumbai
[1:53:49.440 --> 1:53:55.440]  and say that the government lies.
[1:53:55.440 --> 1:54:02.440]  It's amazing, Bob, but again, people are waking up across the board to what's happening.
[1:54:02.440 --> 1:54:05.440]  I'm very happy about it, believe me.
[1:54:05.440 --> 1:54:07.440]  Well, it's very exciting.
[1:54:07.440 --> 1:54:14.440]  But what's scary is you find out that 90% of the public, whether they're a Muslim, a Christian, a Jew, a Hindu,
[1:54:14.440 --> 1:54:16.440]  they have no idea what's going on.
[1:54:16.440 --> 1:54:24.440]  And then once you show them, it makes perfect sense to them and then they understand how we're all being manipulated against each other.
[1:54:24.440 --> 1:54:27.440]  That's absolutely correct.
[1:54:27.440 --> 1:54:29.440]  And that's part of their program.
[1:54:29.440 --> 1:54:35.440]  That's part of the propagandizing, the psychological warfare that goes along with this whole thing,
[1:54:35.440 --> 1:54:42.440]  especially pitting people against one another and infiltrating organizations, which I've seen for years and years and years.
[1:54:42.440 --> 1:54:45.440]  Bob, we've only got a few minutes and then we're going to break for one minute.
[1:54:45.440 --> 1:54:47.440]  I'm going to take you back for just two minutes on the other side.
[1:54:47.440 --> 1:54:54.440]  Gold, I want to talk about gold and what the COMEX is for those that don't know and how they're manipulating it.
[1:54:54.440 --> 1:54:58.440]  It's moved up almost $100 in the last few weeks. Where do you see it going?
[1:54:58.440 --> 1:55:07.440]  I think we're going to base out again for the fifth time in the area somewhere between 7 and 750.
[1:55:07.440 --> 1:55:10.440]  And it's in that realm right now.
[1:55:10.440 --> 1:55:15.440]  The United States government is deliberately suppressing the gold price in here.
[1:55:15.440 --> 1:55:29.440]  And the reason why is they're trying to scare the people who have gold on deposit at the COMEX into putting it into what they call registered form
[1:55:29.440 --> 1:55:35.440]  available for delivery against people who have contracts who want delivery.
[1:55:35.440 --> 1:55:40.440]  And the reason why is that a lot of people are taking delivery of gold.
[1:55:40.440 --> 1:55:46.440]  And here to four, perhaps one percent did. Now there's a lot more than that.
[1:55:46.440 --> 1:55:53.440]  Some of the early figures from Friday, Monday, Tuesday, I have in the publication, more are coming in.
[1:55:53.440 --> 1:56:00.440]  Figures of people taking delivery of their gold, large amounts, not the average person does this.
[1:56:00.440 --> 1:56:06.440]  And they're putting pressure on what has become a two-tier market.
[1:56:06.440 --> 1:56:11.440]  The COMEX is being controlled and manipulated by the United States government.
[1:56:11.440 --> 1:56:18.440]  People who are trading on their speculators and traders, even commercials, which are the pros-pros,
[1:56:18.440 --> 1:56:22.440]  they're leaving there and they're not participating.
[1:56:22.440 --> 1:56:30.440]  The open contracts have dropped from 625,000 to 264,000. That's incredible.
[1:56:30.440 --> 1:56:36.440]  So the physical market is going to win and we may have a default on the COMEX
[1:56:36.440 --> 1:56:39.440]  because they don't have enough gold to deliver against the contracts.
[1:56:39.440 --> 1:56:42.440]  So right now is a huge buying opportunity.
[1:56:42.440 --> 1:56:43.440]  Absolutely.
[1:56:43.440 --> 1:56:47.440]  Stay there Bob, back in 70 seconds to finish up our talk.
[1:56:51.440 --> 1:56:59.440]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:56:59.440 --> 1:57:06.440]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:57:06.440 --> 1:57:10.440]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[1:57:10.440 --> 1:57:12.440]  Bin Laden. This is his MO.
[1:57:12.440 --> 1:57:15.440]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[1:57:15.440 --> 1:57:22.440]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:57:22.440 --> 1:57:29.440]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US.
[1:57:29.440 --> 1:57:33.440]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:57:33.440 --> 1:57:40.440]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[1:57:40.440 --> 1:57:44.440]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies.

[1:58:22.440 --> 1:58:29.440]  On the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:58:29.440 --> 1:58:39.440]  Major General Scubblebine and Dr. Leibah will be joining us coming up for the next hour and 45 minutes or so until the end of the show.
[1:58:39.440 --> 1:58:44.440]  What about their key news coming up? I'm finishing up, Bob, in non-technical terms.
[1:58:44.440 --> 1:58:52.440]  Bob, manipulating the gold paper market. They keep trying to hold it down. But now I'm seeing all these, I mean, hundreds of them on CNBC and everywhere saying,
[1:58:52.440 --> 1:59:00.440]  gold 2000, gold 2000. I don't even want to say that. Why are they having all these big wigs on TV if it's so controlled, saying it's going up to 2000
[1:59:00.440 --> 1:59:05.440]  and now even admitting in a lot of places that the COMEX is manipulated?
[1:59:05.440 --> 1:59:14.440]  I mean, because normally I like to go the opposite direction of what the big boys are saying. I mean, we know it's manipulated. We know it should be over 2000, but what's going to happen?
[1:59:14.440 --> 1:59:25.440]  I think they're letting you know that they know that the government is going to probably end their manipulation. I think that's what's coming.
[1:59:25.440 --> 1:59:37.440]  And they're hoping to set a lid on this thing at 2000. If you go back to 1980 and you figure official inflation, you're looking at close to $3,000.
[1:59:37.440 --> 1:59:47.440]  Unofficial inflation is $6,000 since that time. That's what gold should be and should go to. That's on a natural basis.
[1:59:47.440 --> 1:59:57.440]  And so they don't want it to go there. And obviously, they're happy to keep it at 2000. They're trying to build a bridge there. They're trying to build a buffer.
[1:59:57.440 --> 2:00:07.440]  They're trying to stop it from going there. I know right now it seems strange because gold is down in the 700s, but let me tell you something, these people look ahead.
[2:00:07.440 --> 2:00:09.440]  And that's what that's all about.
[2:00:09.440 --> 2:00:17.440]  All right, theinternationalforecaster.com. Check it out, folks. Get a free trial subscription there. We'll talk to you again. I hope for a full hour next week, Bob.
[2:00:17.440 --> 2:00:18.440]  Okay. Bye-bye.
[2:00:18.440 --> 2:00:26.440]  Take care. There he goes. Now, I want to bring Ted up just for three minutes or so as we've got our guests coming up. Ted, two weeks ago, you offered gold and you bought it at 700.
[2:00:26.440 --> 2:00:35.440]  50-something bucks above that right now. You can pass on that savings. You have two coins left. All the other coins are sold out, but you have sovereigns and Franks at a new great deal.
[2:00:35.440 --> 2:00:47.440]  Briefly, and this is a great deal, folks. Again, it's a great hedge against inflation and insurance policy. And then separately, if you're doing it for speculation, for what could be giant profits, it's also smart to get into.
[2:00:47.440 --> 2:00:53.440]  But for me, gold is just an insurance policy. And regardless, it's a time to buy right now.
[2:00:53.440 --> 2:00:56.440]  Ted, tell folks about today's offer.
[2:00:56.440 --> 2:01:07.440]  Yeah, what I have right now, Alex, I've got the last group of a bunch of 10-dollar gold pieces that I'd purchased, a combination of 10-dollar Indians and 10-dollar Liberties, where they picked up when there was around $700 an ounce.
[2:01:07.440 --> 2:01:20.440]  They are the pre-1933 coins, the real U.S. coins that were made here, used as currency. Currently, that coin is a 10-dollar Indian. They're at 673 and the 10-dollar Liberties at 653.
[2:01:20.440 --> 2:01:30.440]  Obviously, the Franks and the British sovereigns are really good buy. You have to get into smaller gold pieces, and you can't do it better than this, not with U.S. seagulls.
[2:01:30.440 --> 2:01:41.440]  And to explain, most places don't even have gold or silver, or there's 30%, 40%, 50% premiums. There's no premium on this, because most of these coins that he's offering, he had before it went up.
[2:01:41.440 --> 2:01:56.440]  That's exactly what's going on, Alex, right now. The physical supply on gold is just absolutely scarce. It's so hard to find coins to buy right now, and everybody, all my customers call me, and let me know how tough it is out there to try to buy even for my competitors.
[2:01:56.440 --> 2:02:16.440]  But yeah, right now, and walking Liberties halves, they're a good buy at $8.40. Again, everything in the precious metals market has such turmoil. I mean, like when you see what Citigroup here just did, the article they published here just the other day, talking about gold being at $3,000 an ounce, and they're like one of the Federal Reserve Bank branches.
[2:02:16.440 --> 2:02:30.440]  And that was a secret memo that was covered by the BBC, the London Telegraph, and the Wall Street Journal. They're saying 3,000 by next year. We're not saying that. Those are internal memos. The point is, is that gold has intrinsic value. This is a great deal.
[2:02:30.440 --> 2:02:46.440]  It's $800, 686, 2237. The brokers will be there until midnight tonight. Folks, they also have half dollar silver at a great deal right now. $800, 686, 2237, 800, 686, 2237. How much is the silver, Ted?
[2:02:46.440 --> 2:02:54.440]  The silver is $860, and it's really a good buy too, Alex. People need to have silver in their hands right now with the economic events that are coming. Are you kidding me?
[2:02:54.440 --> 2:03:03.440]  Yeah, folks, get into this before everybody else does. There's already huge shortages. 800, 686, 2237. Tell them it's the radio special. Thank you, Ted.
[2:03:03.440 --> 2:03:05.440]  Thanks for having me out. You bet.
[2:03:05.440 --> 2:03:25.440]  Stay with us.
[2:03:35.440 --> 2:03:50.440]  850 billion dollars at least out of thin air. This money now owns the American and European banks. The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities, particularly food beyond many Americans reach.
[2:03:50.440 --> 2:04:07.440]  In pre-Nazi Germany, super inflation, the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days until it reached over 4 billion marks. Food prices are skyrocketing so fast, there seems as if there may be no end in sight. The private banks, merging with our government, are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves.
[2:04:07.440 --> 2:04:19.440]  The stores have less food, but jack up prices to stay in business. Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared and be ready. Everything is zeroing in on food. One third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities.
[2:04:19.440 --> 2:04:31.440]  My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared, get self-sufficient, get food. For everybody out there listening, it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food, the government, the new old order has a lot less control over you.
[2:04:31.440 --> 2:04:38.440]  And so it's a mindset, a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness. No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[2:04:38.440 --> 2:04:49.440]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports, and they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[2:04:49.440 --> 2:05:00.440]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com. Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high quality, freeze dried, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[2:05:00.440 --> 2:05:15.440]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633. Again, 800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com. Take action today. The first step is getting storable food.
[2:05:15.440 --> 2:05:37.440]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:05:37.440 --> 2:05:52.440]  For the rest of this hour and the entirety of the next, we have two great guests on with us. We're going to open the phones up at the end of the show in the last 30 minutes or so for our guests joining us from Central America down in Panama.
[2:05:52.440 --> 2:06:10.440]  For the founders of Natural Solutions Foundation, I tried to go over both their bios it would take all day, but Major General Albert in Stubblebine, U.S. Army retired, and of course he headed up the U.S. Army's electronic research and development command, U.S. Army's intelligence and security command.
[2:06:10.440 --> 2:06:23.440]  He was the head of Army Special Forces, the head of Fort Bragg. He's worked for some of the biggest and some of the most secretive defense contractors. He's been involved in some of the most secretive black op operations.
[2:06:23.440 --> 2:06:39.440]  And after all these years of research, he's come to basically the same conclusion I have. This is a giant world government set up to carry out eugenics, an extermination of the majority of the public with ambient soft kill weapons being slowly and incrementally turned up.
[2:06:39.440 --> 2:06:51.440]  And then institutionalizing and covering up through compartmentalization the deaths, the diseases, cancer, one in 33 having it now, one in two males, one in three females, diabetes up thousands of percentile.
[2:06:51.440 --> 2:06:59.440]  The media is saying that poison, melamine and milk is good. It's saying that the deadly plastic chemicals are good as people die en masse.
[2:06:59.440 --> 2:07:10.440]  It's saying that GMO foods that sterilize the rats and mice are good for us as it sterilizes the public as sperm counts drop by more than 80 percent. Women are infertile. Just mass plagues all by design.
[2:07:10.440 --> 2:07:20.440]  And they have studied it all. They have really single handedly with the help of the folks that are members of the organization help shoot down a lot of takeovers by Codex Alimentarius.
[2:07:20.440 --> 2:07:31.440]  They've been some of the sole reporters who at gunpoint have been pushed out of meetings, public supposed meetings that they've been, you know, guest of at the UN. Just amazing stories.
[2:07:31.440 --> 2:07:39.440]  So I wanted to have them on with this major general stubble bind and the medical director of healthfreedomusa.org.
[2:07:39.440 --> 2:07:52.440]  And that is Rima E. Labo, a MD, graduate of Albert Einstein College of Medicine. And then it goes through all of her amazing research and all the great findings that she has made.
[2:07:52.440 --> 2:07:57.440]  So we're honored to have both of these individuals, husband and wife on with us for the balance of the show.
[2:07:57.440 --> 2:08:08.440]  And let's go ahead and bring up General Stubblebind because I didn't, the last person I talked to was the doctor. General, it's good to have you on with us here today.
[2:08:08.440 --> 2:08:11.440]  Well, and it's great to be here.
[2:08:11.440 --> 2:08:19.440]  A lot is happening. Just a side issue before we get into the Codex Alimentarius, what you saw in Europe, and bring the doctor in.
[2:08:19.440 --> 2:08:25.440]  Have you heard all the big announcements that they're going to abolish the National Guard? I have all the documents here, but it's in the Washington Post.
[2:08:25.440 --> 2:08:38.440]  And put them under Northcom, and it says for civil insurrection, and to work with the police, and they're deploying microwave guns in all the major cities to prepare, I guess, for war with the American people.
[2:08:38.440 --> 2:08:49.440]  I had a retired Jag Carnawan, first hour, saying that this is unconstitutional. What's your take on it being the former head of Special Forces?
[2:08:49.440 --> 2:08:57.440]  It's absolutely not constitutional, and it bothers the hell out of me if you really want to know.
[2:08:57.440 --> 2:08:59.440]  Well, please elaborate, sir, because this is...
[2:08:59.440 --> 2:09:12.440]  I think it is horrible. You know, we have a constitution, and what we've done with it is burn it, throw it away, and forget about it, and it's wrong.
[2:09:12.440 --> 2:09:23.440]  Now, when you were heading up the areas of the Army in the 70s and 80s, and into the early 90s, or back in the 80s, I mean, back then, if they tried this with the Army then, what would...
[2:09:23.440 --> 2:09:26.440]  What would you be saying if you were there today?
[2:09:26.440 --> 2:09:46.440]  It'd be a revolt. They would say, you can't do that. It's not constitutional. You cannot use the military, the Army, or the Navy, or the Marines, or the Air Force, for civil or civil actions.
[2:09:46.440 --> 2:09:53.440]  It is not constitutional, and that's exactly what we would have said then.
[2:09:53.440 --> 2:10:05.440]  Why isn't it constitutional? No, absolutely. Why is it not constitutional? Why did the founders, why did every other civilized nation say you don't have your Army engaging the people?
[2:10:05.440 --> 2:10:17.440]  Because the Army has meant to kill people and break things and go after enemies. I mean, why did the Romans 2,000 years ago say it's against the law for Caesar to bring the troops into Rome?
[2:10:17.440 --> 2:10:45.440]  Because you didn't want somebody who could become then a dictator, and by using the Army to quell any kind of unrest, any kind of disagreement, you didn't want this so-called ruler to take advantage of the power of the Army literally to quell the populace.
[2:10:45.440 --> 2:11:06.440]  That's the reason that they passed the dated unconstitutional, because they knew then that it was not going to be correct if a ruler could become a dictator by using the military. Very simple.
[2:11:06.440 --> 2:11:20.440]  And that's what the Army War College and the Naval War College and all of them said for hundreds of years, and my dad's got a big book, The History of the Army, and right in there it has several chapters saying what you just said.
[2:11:20.440 --> 2:11:28.440]  So the Army has to know what they're being told to do now is treason against the Constitution.
[2:11:28.440 --> 2:11:53.440]  Well, it's very interesting because at some level, or some levels, we apparently have sort of morphed into this position we're in, instead of, you know, we didn't just sort of jump into this thing one day and suddenly be there.
[2:11:53.440 --> 2:12:08.440]  We've kind of oozed or morphed into this thing. I don't know what the current commanders are thinking, but I cannot help but believe that they are very, very upset with some of the things that are going on.
[2:12:08.440 --> 2:12:31.440]  I mean, you know, they brought this unit out of Iraq. They hatched it to North Com. They said, oh, by the way, your primary mission is going to be to quell riots to move people into detaining so many things.
[2:12:31.440 --> 2:12:38.440]  And actually, we're going to be concentration camps. And that was two months.
[2:12:38.440 --> 2:12:50.440]  And I can't believe that a commander who's being given that order doesn't take what the hell is going on here.
[2:12:50.440 --> 2:12:58.440]  Well, that was two months ago, 3,000 troops, the third brigade. Now they announced 20,000, and then I read the fine print.
[2:12:58.440 --> 2:13:01.440]  I can say all of the National Guard.
[2:13:01.440 --> 2:13:14.440]  Yeah, and then I read deeper and it talks about Obama's civilian corps of one million. Does that concern you, sir? A one million man spy corps?
[2:13:14.440 --> 2:13:17.440]  Or is that going to be a personal army?
[2:13:17.440 --> 2:13:31.440]  Oh, no, it's going to be outside the army. You're right. Yes, they're saying it's going to be a federal domestic force. I mean, how do people not recognize that that is, I mean, that is classic tyranny, is it not, sir?
[2:13:31.440 --> 2:13:49.440]  Okay, how can you have your own army? I mean, look at Blackwater. You know, what is Blackwater? Who's a legion? Does Blackwater swear to the Constitution? Oh, no, no, no, no.
[2:13:49.440 --> 2:14:05.440]  Does it swear to Albertan? Well, I think so. So how do you then have your own personal army and then is there more than one personal army out there?
[2:14:05.440 --> 2:14:23.440]  You know, Albertan got one and Obama have one. Does McCain have one? Who else has their own personal army? And why? You know, the big question is not do they do, but why do they have it?
[2:14:23.440 --> 2:14:34.440]  Well, what's coming? Alex, what's coming that we don't know that each one of these individuals needs their own army?
[2:14:34.440 --> 2:14:40.440]  What is that in your educated opinion, General?
[2:14:40.440 --> 2:15:09.440]  I think something is getting ready to happen, which is devastating and don't know whether it's another false flag event like 9-11. Don't know whether it's a avian flu pandemic. I don't know. I don't know the exact details of what is coming.
[2:15:09.440 --> 2:15:37.440]  You can bet your bottom dollar. People in the power structure know that they need an army, their private army. The people in the power structure know that they need train the regular army or riot control and people control know that something is coming that is devastating.
[2:15:37.440 --> 2:15:41.440]  They know the exact details of it. We do not.
[2:15:41.440 --> 2:15:55.440]  And you're saying they've been setting this up quietly for decades. As you know, it seems it's all coming to a head. Are you saying, General, the evidence is showing it's going to be initiated? It's going to be staged?
[2:15:55.440 --> 2:16:13.440]  Well, it's very interesting because let me tell you how the intelligence works. First of all, any single piece of information is nothing more than a dot. That's all I did. It is an unverified piece of information.
[2:16:13.440 --> 2:16:30.440]  Then you get another unverified piece of information. The third unverified piece of information. I now have three dots and four dots. Then when I get to a hundred dots, suddenly a picture emerges out of the dot.
[2:16:30.440 --> 2:16:50.440]  It's no longer a set of dots. It's a picture that emerges. Oh, by the way, even though each dot may or may not be fully substantiated, the mass of the dots that come out to create the picture, suddenly you're sitting there looking at all these dots.
[2:16:50.440 --> 2:17:05.440]  Suddenly out of this, like a 3D crossword or a 3D picture puzzle. Exactly. That's how amazing, General. Stay there. We're going to break and come back and then shift into the health attack, what's happening, how we counter it.
[2:17:05.440 --> 2:17:15.440]  But that's exactly how I described it myself earlier this week. I'll study things for years. And then finally, it's like all the pieces come together. It's exactly what you're saying.
[2:17:15.440 --> 2:17:24.440]  I want to skip this break. I want to skip this break, John. General Stubblebine. General Stubblebine.
[2:17:24.440 --> 2:17:26.440]  He should be there.
[2:17:26.440 --> 2:17:30.440]  I think he's handing the phone to Dr. Lebo. Dr. Lebo?
[2:17:30.440 --> 2:17:32.440]  Yeah, I'm here too.
[2:17:32.440 --> 2:17:34.440]  Are you guys sharing the telephone again down there in Panama?
[2:17:34.440 --> 2:17:36.440]  No, we have separate phones.
[2:17:36.440 --> 2:17:45.440]  Okay, fantastic. Listen, listen, we're on the internet live right now. We're going to be back on the main AM and FM when we come back. What do you guys both want to get into first?
[2:17:45.440 --> 2:18:04.440]  What Codex Alimentarius is? A recap of how you've been fighting it, what the latest meeting revealed, and then go through the catalog of things they're doing to us, and then how to counter it, and then how folks can go join your organization or get on your free mailing list.
[2:18:04.440 --> 2:18:20.440]  I also want to have time, Alex, to talk about reclaiming the production of food and taking back your health by taking back your food, becoming an intensive farmer in your apartment or whatever, and we want to talk about the Panama Project.
[2:18:20.440 --> 2:18:32.440]  Okay, let me just briefly ask the general a question. General, were you done with the statement about the dots, or do you want to briefly, when we come back, finish that and then get into all the other topics, or are you done on that?
[2:18:32.440 --> 2:18:49.440]  All I want to do is, just like you, suddenly a picture emerges and you say, oh, it, you know, truth dawns then, and now what do you do with it? You're stuck with this picture, and you now have to, you know, take the countermeasure against that.
[2:18:49.440 --> 2:19:04.440]  I mean, you call it dots, now they're just announcing it. I mean, they say, this is for the American people, they say they're going to use the army on us. They say torture is good. They, they, they, they, and it's psychological warfare.
[2:19:04.440 --> 2:19:16.440]  I mean, you're an expert in this, but perhaps you could speak to this when we come back too, and then, and then we're going to do a big turn with Dr. Lebo, we appreciate her being here, is that it seems they're throwing it in our face to kind of just shock us into acclamation.
[2:19:16.440 --> 2:19:29.440]  When they go, we always said mercury was bad, now it's good for kids. We always said melamine was bad, now we say it's good for kids. You know, we always said that poison was bad, now it's good. I mean, it's like they're wanting to reveal.
[2:19:29.440 --> 2:19:56.440]  It was, it was predicted, and this was delineated by George Orwell. We know how this works. He was, he was a prescient genius who told us they're following the Orwellian script. They do it just as he said they would do it. They twist meaning, they change reality, and if we're not alert and holding on to our reality, we become their pawns.
[2:19:56.440 --> 2:20:16.440]  Absolutely. One point, we're going live in one minute. General Stubblemine's phone is a bit low, yours is a bit hot, and I know you're in another country, so I'm surprised by the quality we've got. General Stubblemine, just speak up a little bit, sir, and then Dr. Lebo, you might want to back off a bit.
[2:20:16.440 --> 2:20:23.440]  But again, you guys are the best, and I will plug each hour how folks get on your free mailing list and all the great information you've got it.
[2:20:23.440 --> 2:20:30.440]  Fabulous. Fabulous. You're the only person in the world that I'd ever agree to back off for.
[2:20:30.440 --> 2:20:32.440]  But you are a little loud.
[2:20:32.440 --> 2:20:42.440]  Oh, yeah. It's, it's, see, I've got it cranked way up so I can hear the general, and then when you talk, it's like, it's like the thunders.
[2:20:42.440 --> 2:20:46.440]  I'm holding the phone further away. Does that help?
[2:20:46.440 --> 2:20:55.440]  Uh, yeah. Okay, yeah, it's a lot better. Here we go. We're going live in 20 seconds, and we'll come back and have the general finish and then go back to you.
[2:20:55.440 --> 2:21:17.440]  This is a short segment, a long one. We had an 18 minute segment coming up, so you won't be interrupted after this one. This is a short one. Here we go, guys.
[2:21:17.440 --> 2:21:28.440]  Alright, let's go right back to our guest, General Stubblebein, finishing up the point about an intelligence. A dot here, a dot there, and then overall, you get the clear picture.
[2:21:28.440 --> 2:21:36.440]  Now that's not even dots, they're just throwing it in our face, admitting everything. Finish up that thought, sir.
[2:21:36.440 --> 2:21:51.440]  Well, the first thing that, when you have the dots, and you know, it's nothing but a set of dots, and then suddenly, just suddenly, the entire picture just sort of is there in front of you, and you said, oh my God, I've had this information all along.
[2:21:51.440 --> 2:22:10.440]  There it is. Now I know. The question then becomes, what do I do about it? When I know what the picture is, and I know it's horrific, what the heck do I do? Do I just accept it? Do I just sort of lay down and give up?
[2:22:10.440 --> 2:22:32.440]  Or do I begin to resist? Do I mount a resistance of some sort? What do I do with this picture now that I know what it is? And what's happening, Alex, unfortunately, and you mentioned it, what's happening is they're now saying, oh yes, by the way, we are going to destroy the Constitution.
[2:22:32.440 --> 2:22:49.440]  We're not going to pay attention to the Constitution. And oh, by the way, we are going to deploy Army troops to quell any kind of resistance that you might put up. And if you resist, you probably are going to go into a detainment camp somewhere.
[2:22:49.440 --> 2:23:04.440]  Well, now that they're pronouncing it, now that they're saying it, again, what does the populace do? I'll tell you what most of it is doing, it's saying, whoa, back off, back off, back off.
[2:23:04.440 --> 2:23:12.440]  I think I will be quiet. I think I will just shut up and pay attention to what the new rules are going to be.
[2:23:12.440 --> 2:23:26.440]  So you say they're openly general, sorry to interrupt. So you're saying they're openly announcing it to cause a chilling effect. And A, that's one question. And then B, I'm going to throw this in, they threaten Congress, as you know, or if you don't, we'll play the clip.
[2:23:26.440 --> 2:23:38.440]  Senator Inhofe admits it, others with martial law, they wouldn't pass the banker takeover. So this is the illegitimate government, this menacing the real government. Go ahead.
[2:23:38.440 --> 2:23:51.440]  That's exactly what's happening. And oh, by the way, what is being, what is happening with all of these announcements, the introduction of fear, fear subdues.
[2:23:51.440 --> 2:24:01.440]  And let me tell you, that's exactly where they're headed, because they're going to make it fearful for anybody to do anything in the way of resistance, period.
[2:24:01.440 --> 2:24:08.440]  Well, is something wrong with me then, or you? All this does is make me angry and want to mount a resistance.
[2:24:08.440 --> 2:24:09.440]  Well, may I jump in?
[2:24:09.440 --> 2:24:10.440]  Yes, go ahead, Dr.
[2:24:10.440 --> 2:24:22.440]  I think what's happening is that you and General Stubblebine and I and the other patriots and freedom folks have not brushed their teeth with enough fluoride.
[2:24:22.440 --> 2:24:37.440]  Fluoride, as I'm sure your listeners know, Alex, and as I know, you know, was used initially in the Soviet Gulag to make the political prisoners easy to deal with.
[2:24:37.440 --> 2:24:49.440]  They became tractable, complacent. It's a neurological toxin, and all this nonsense about tooth decay, prevention and so on, is just so much nonsense.
[2:24:49.440 --> 2:24:55.440]  Fluoride is to do the populace, and at another time we can have a discussion.
[2:24:55.440 --> 2:24:57.440]  Well, we've got an hour and a half coming up, so we can get into that.
[2:24:57.440 --> 2:25:03.440]  By the way, two years ago, the American Medical Association said, kids under six don't give it to them, it's bad for your teeth.
[2:25:03.440 --> 2:25:10.440]  So, for those that don't believe us, they admit it's not good for your teeth, it causes dental ferocious, but you're a medical doctor.
[2:25:10.440 --> 2:25:13.440]  Certainly, you can speak to that.
[2:25:13.440 --> 2:25:14.440]  Absolutely.
[2:25:14.440 --> 2:25:21.440]  But the point is that we have been poisoned, we have been subdued psychologically through the media.
[2:25:21.440 --> 2:25:35.440]  We have been rendered fearful, and we have been rendered apathetic by the toxins in our diet, by the microwaves, and by the toxic information, or quote, information, that we've taken in.
[2:25:35.440 --> 2:25:37.440]  It's having its effect.
[2:25:37.440 --> 2:25:48.440]  This is a full-spectrum cocktail, and then you find out they knew decades before, and they deploy these as weapon systems against us, General.
[2:25:48.440 --> 2:25:51.440]  Absolutely, and guess what?
[2:25:51.440 --> 2:25:56.440]  The food that is being degraded is being used as a weapon.
[2:25:56.440 --> 2:26:04.440]  I mean, you know, it's not being touted right now as weaponized food, but that's exactly where they're going, and that's exactly what's happening.
[2:26:04.440 --> 2:26:22.440]  So every bit of bite of food that you take in, if you allow them the privilege of eating the food that they would like you to eat, you know, if you don't eat organic food, then you're going to get the GMO food.
[2:26:22.440 --> 2:26:32.440]  You're going to get all of the things that have been put into there that will impact your body and not impact it very well.
[2:26:32.440 --> 2:26:37.440]  As you know, as you know, food is being weaponized.
[2:26:37.440 --> 2:26:38.440]  Yes.
[2:26:38.440 --> 2:26:43.440]  We're going to come back and talk about that more with Major General Stubblebine and Dr. Lebo.
[2:26:43.440 --> 2:26:45.440]  Now, folks understand something.
[2:26:45.440 --> 2:26:53.440]  The UN said in 97 at the World Food Council in Beijing, they said we are going to use food as a weapon, and it's in the Royal Commission on Population.
[2:26:53.440 --> 2:26:54.440]  Put out where the British they are.
[2:26:54.440 --> 2:26:57.440]  So what the general and the doctor are saying is the truth.
[2:26:57.440 --> 2:27:02.440]  Amazing interview with General Stubblebine and Dr. Lebo and their website.
[2:27:02.440 --> 2:27:06.440]  We've got that up on screen at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[2:27:06.440 --> 2:27:07.440]  We're on the march.
[2:27:07.440 --> 2:27:10.440]  The Empire's on the run.
[2:27:10.440 --> 2:27:14.440]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:27:14.440 --> 2:27:16.440]  John, let them know we're going to be back in three minutes.
[2:27:16.440 --> 2:27:17.440]  Did you know that it's a doctorate?
[2:27:17.440 --> 2:27:18.440]  You got it.
[2:27:18.440 --> 2:27:25.440]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection.
[2:27:25.440 --> 2:27:33.440]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases from these parasites and your doctor would never know it.
[2:27:33.440 --> 2:27:37.440]  In fact, clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases.
[2:27:37.440 --> 2:27:40.440]  Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis.
[2:27:40.440 --> 2:27:52.440]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metal poisoning and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP, with your favorite beverage once a day.
[2:27:52.440 --> 2:27:58.440]  FPP is used around the world, has numerous uses and is now available to you from Freshwater Organics.
[2:27:58.440 --> 2:28:06.440]  FPP strengthens skin, hair and bones, lowers cholesterol and is an excellent source of natural plant-based silica with 14 trace minerals.

[2:28:15.440 --> 2:28:23.440]  May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message of information. 9-11 was an inside job.
[2:28:23.440 --> 2:28:26.440]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[2:28:26.440 --> 2:28:33.440]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage? Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CIFR?
[2:28:33.440 --> 2:28:42.440]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[2:28:42.440 --> 2:28:47.440]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[2:28:47.440 --> 2:28:52.440]  An inside job? How dare you?
[2:28:52.440 --> 2:28:58.440]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[2:28:58.440 --> 2:29:01.440]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[2:29:01.440 --> 2:29:07.440]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[2:29:07.440 --> 2:29:12.440]  Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[2:29:12.440 --> 2:29:38.440]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[2:29:42.440 --> 2:29:49.440]  $38 a pair or $36 a dozen, snowshoe binding for $8 or $48 a dozen, and so much more.
[2:29:49.440 --> 2:29:53.440]  Even hard to find surplus items all at surplus prices.
[2:29:53.440 --> 2:29:58.440]  Preparing the whole family has never been so affordable at mainmilitary.com.
[2:29:58.440 --> 2:30:03.440]  Mainmilitary.com, one of the last surviving true surplus stores in the country.
[2:30:03.440 --> 2:30:15.440]  Now at mainmilitary.com or call 877-608-0179. That's 877-608-0179 today.
[2:30:34.440 --> 2:30:42.440]  The entire configuration being designed by the global government, openly announced now, there's no more denial.
[2:30:42.440 --> 2:30:48.440]  Those of us who could see the dots years ago, decades ago, you laughed at us, now it's not even dots.
[2:30:48.440 --> 2:30:54.440]  They just took the mask right off and they said, we're coming straight on for humanity.
[2:30:54.440 --> 2:30:58.440]  We don't have a choice, we have to fight back in any way we can.
[2:30:58.440 --> 2:31:06.440]  I'm going to ask Major General Stubblebein and Dr. Lebo from their educated perspective what we do in that fight.
[2:31:06.440 --> 2:31:12.440]  But let's continue for those that don't know, with some of the worst things, not just the melamine,
[2:31:12.440 --> 2:31:18.440]  but the plastics with the estrogen mimicking, endocrine disruptors, what the GMO foods are doing,
[2:31:18.440 --> 2:31:24.440]  sterilizing, what's being sprayed, the fluoride, the mercury, the arsenic being added by design,
[2:31:24.440 --> 2:31:29.440]  not just fluoride, but all added to the water, and where you see this all going,
[2:31:29.440 --> 2:31:36.440]  as they build up and they mass all of this against us, as they get private armies to protect their own systems,
[2:31:36.440 --> 2:31:39.440]  it's clear, as you said, General, they're bringing in something hellish.
[2:31:39.440 --> 2:31:45.440]  So both of you, you have the floor, just whatever you think is most important.
[2:31:45.440 --> 2:31:51.440]  Well, let's start with the fact that every bite we take can either add to our health and our vitality,
[2:31:51.440 --> 2:31:57.440]  or it can diminish our ability to protect ourselves through our immune system
[2:31:57.440 --> 2:32:01.440]  and through our regenerative capacity.
[2:32:01.440 --> 2:32:07.440]  I'm a physician. I have practiced drug-free medicine for the best part of 40 years.
[2:32:07.440 --> 2:32:12.440]  So I'm very, very aware of what nutrition does.
[2:32:12.440 --> 2:32:17.440]  And you've treated and you've treated to interrupt royalty and heads of state.
[2:32:17.440 --> 2:32:21.440]  But, I mean, so you're a top physician. Go ahead.
[2:32:21.440 --> 2:32:28.440]  And the reason that royalty heads of state people from all over the world came to see us in our practice
[2:32:28.440 --> 2:32:35.440]  was that when everything else that conventional medicine has to offer has failed,
[2:32:35.440 --> 2:32:39.440]  people seek the sensible alternatives.
[2:32:39.440 --> 2:32:46.440]  And I am, by the way, a physician who believes that the only place that pharmaceuticals have a reason
[2:32:46.440 --> 2:32:50.440]  to exist in medicine is in the emergency room.
[2:32:50.440 --> 2:32:56.440]  Beyond that, virtually everything that a pharmaceutical does, dangerously, extensively,
[2:32:56.440 --> 2:33:02.440]  and with tremendous side effects, everything can be done by natural methods,
[2:33:02.440 --> 2:33:06.440]  by frequency medicine, by nutrition, by energy medicine.
[2:33:06.440 --> 2:33:11.440]  And the reason I can say that so confidently is that throughout my entire career,
[2:33:11.440 --> 2:33:17.440]  I have treated the most difficult patients that anybody can have in their practice,
[2:33:17.440 --> 2:33:23.440]  people who were dying or unable to tolerate meds and in terrible trouble.
[2:33:23.440 --> 2:33:30.440]  And they came to me and, by and large, they got well, not just symptom-free,
[2:33:30.440 --> 2:33:36.440]  which is all that allopathic medicine has to offer if it does that well and usually it doesn't,
[2:33:36.440 --> 2:33:42.440]  but truly, radiantly, and in many cases, transcendently well,
[2:33:42.440 --> 2:33:47.440]  through giving the body, the heart, the mind, the spirit, what it needs to heal.
[2:33:47.440 --> 2:33:50.440]  What it does not need is toxins.
[2:33:50.440 --> 2:33:57.440]  If you are eating conventional American food, what we call the Standard American Diet, or SAD,
[2:33:57.440 --> 2:34:01.440]  you are already eating weaponized food.
[2:34:01.440 --> 2:34:06.440]  I just published an article in one of our blog spots,
[2:34:06.440 --> 2:34:12.440]  which you can get to by going to our main website, healthfreedomusa.org,
[2:34:12.440 --> 2:34:17.440]  and then clicking on the second button on the left, which takes you to the Health Freedom blog.
[2:34:17.440 --> 2:34:27.440]  I just published an article today on the fact that the food supply already contains food grown from seeds,
[2:34:27.440 --> 2:34:37.440]  which have been irradiated not to prevent mold or bacteria from growing, not to sterilize it,
[2:34:37.440 --> 2:34:42.440]  but to induce wild mutations.
[2:34:42.440 --> 2:34:47.440]  Nobody knows what the long-term results of those mutations will be,
[2:34:47.440 --> 2:34:52.440]  yet once a seed has developed a mutation that the seed scientists like,
[2:34:52.440 --> 2:34:58.440]  they mix it in the food supply, and you're eating that mutated food.
[2:34:58.440 --> 2:35:03.440]  That's different from genetic modification, and if that isn't weaponizing food,
[2:35:03.440 --> 2:35:05.440]  then I don't know what is.
[2:35:05.440 --> 2:35:08.440]  And their open air, and their open air, can you speak to this?
[2:35:08.440 --> 2:35:11.440]  And then the general wants to come and pop in.
[2:35:11.440 --> 2:35:16.440]  They are open air planting thousands of varieties of x-rayed and gamma-rayed
[2:35:16.440 --> 2:35:22.440]  and cross-species plant varieties, which are cousins to all these other plants,
[2:35:22.440 --> 2:35:26.440]  and it's openly jumping in to all the other crops.
[2:35:26.440 --> 2:35:27.440]  That's on record.
[2:35:27.440 --> 2:35:29.440]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[2:35:29.440 --> 2:35:34.440]  And they are also openly the United States Department of Agriculture
[2:35:34.440 --> 2:35:40.440]  in the process in these last lame-duck disastrous days of deregulating everything in the world
[2:35:40.440 --> 2:35:46.440]  that the U.S. government can, is in the process of essentially eliminating
[2:35:46.440 --> 2:35:50.440]  any controls or regulations on the outdoor growth,
[2:35:50.440 --> 2:35:55.440]  and therefore the genetic mixing of genetically modified plants.
[2:35:55.440 --> 2:36:02.440]  That means that, for instance, foods that are genetically altered
[2:36:02.440 --> 2:36:09.440]  to produce industrial chemicals or pharmaceuticals will be allowed to mix their DNA
[2:36:09.440 --> 2:36:14.440]  with everything else, not just other food crops of the same species,
[2:36:14.440 --> 2:36:18.440]  but food crops of other species, and weeds, and they get into insects,
[2:36:18.440 --> 2:36:21.440]  and they get into animals that eat them that we eat.
[2:36:21.440 --> 2:36:25.440]  We're talking about food armageddon.
[2:36:25.440 --> 2:36:28.440]  Now, that is not acceptable to me.
[2:36:28.440 --> 2:36:32.440]  We're talking about intentionally despoiling the earth,
[2:36:32.440 --> 2:36:35.440]  and if anybody doubts that it's intentional,
[2:36:35.440 --> 2:36:41.440]  all they need to do is go to your data, Alex, or go to our data on our website,
[2:36:41.440 --> 2:36:43.440]  healthfreedomusa.org.
[2:36:43.440 --> 2:36:48.440]  We have something called the GMO files in our health freedom blog,
[2:36:48.440 --> 2:36:53.440]  and there's an abundance of truly horrifying independent science.
[2:36:53.440 --> 2:36:55.440]  This is designed to kill.
[2:36:55.440 --> 2:36:56.440]  This is designed to maim.
[2:36:56.440 --> 2:36:59.440]  This is designed to weaken the immune system,
[2:36:59.440 --> 2:37:02.440]  and this is designed to cause infertility.
[2:37:02.440 --> 2:37:07.440]  Now, if that's what you want for yourself, then that's fine.
[2:37:07.440 --> 2:37:08.440]  Do nothing.
[2:37:08.440 --> 2:37:10.440]  Continue to eat processed food.
[2:37:10.440 --> 2:37:15.440]  Continue to be a person with a slave mentality
[2:37:15.440 --> 2:37:19.440]  and be amused by the distance of the mainstream media.
[2:37:19.440 --> 2:37:23.440]  Just to add a question here to both of you.
[2:37:23.440 --> 2:37:26.440]  I've had Nobel Prize-winning geneticist on.
[2:37:26.440 --> 2:37:27.440]  I've had top scientists.
[2:37:27.440 --> 2:37:30.440]  I mean, these people that were running multi-billion dollar companies,
[2:37:30.440 --> 2:37:35.440]  and they'll talk about how if you change one gene in a rat or one gene in a tomato
[2:37:35.440 --> 2:37:39.440]  or one gene in a pig, it randomly, you get the change you want,
[2:37:39.440 --> 2:37:42.440]  but it randomly changes thousands of other things,
[2:37:42.440 --> 2:37:46.440]  and they admit that the German studies killing the honeybees
[2:37:46.440 --> 2:37:50.440]  with just one form of GMO corn that has a pesticide grow naturally in it
[2:37:50.440 --> 2:37:52.440]  so other bugs won't eat it, but the honeybees will,
[2:37:52.440 --> 2:37:57.440]  then they feed us those pesticides that are secreted in the corn naturally,
[2:37:57.440 --> 2:37:59.440]  as you know, but for audience listening.
[2:37:59.440 --> 2:38:03.440]  You know, they talk about global warming and climate change and world taxes.
[2:38:03.440 --> 2:38:08.440]  That's a red herring to divert everybody off of all the genetic manipulation
[2:38:08.440 --> 2:38:11.440]  of the very biosphere of the planet.
[2:38:11.440 --> 2:38:13.440]  I mean, when you say Armageddon, you're not kidding.
[2:38:13.440 --> 2:38:14.440]  Already most of the...
[2:38:14.440 --> 2:38:16.440]  I'm not kidding.
[2:38:16.440 --> 2:38:18.440]  Already most of the live oaks are dying in Texas.
[2:38:18.440 --> 2:38:19.440]  The bees are all dying.
[2:38:19.440 --> 2:38:20.440]  There's hardly any birds.
[2:38:20.440 --> 2:38:21.440]  Everything's dying.
[2:38:21.440 --> 2:38:23.440]  Go ahead.
[2:38:23.440 --> 2:38:26.440]  I wouldn't call it Armageddon.
[2:38:26.440 --> 2:38:28.440]  I would say that there's a war.
[2:38:28.440 --> 2:38:31.440]  I mean, this is a war that we're in.
[2:38:31.440 --> 2:38:36.440]  And as a war, you must take action.
[2:38:36.440 --> 2:38:44.440]  You cannot, you cannot sit back and not do anything unless you want to be a slave or dead.
[2:38:44.440 --> 2:38:47.440]  Yeah, well, they're not even wanting to enslave us.
[2:38:47.440 --> 2:38:48.440]  To choose.
[2:38:48.440 --> 2:38:50.440]  Slave or dead.
[2:38:50.440 --> 2:38:56.440]  Well, I think that in previous wars, the idea was to capture the population
[2:38:56.440 --> 2:38:59.440]  and use it for your own purposes.
[2:38:59.440 --> 2:39:00.440]  This war...
[2:39:00.440 --> 2:39:01.440]  But they were called slave.
[2:39:01.440 --> 2:39:02.440]  They were called serf.
[2:39:02.440 --> 2:39:03.440]  You're right.
[2:39:03.440 --> 2:39:04.440]  They were called serf.
[2:39:04.440 --> 2:39:05.440]  This is genocide, though.
[2:39:05.440 --> 2:39:07.440]  This war is a genocidal war.
[2:39:07.440 --> 2:39:09.440]  There will be a few serfs.
[2:39:09.440 --> 2:39:16.440]  But with mechanized labor-saving devices with machines, with cyborgs,
[2:39:16.440 --> 2:39:18.440]  we don't need very many serfs.
[2:39:18.440 --> 2:39:24.440]  What they are going to want to do, and we were told this by a head of state
[2:39:24.440 --> 2:39:26.440]  whom we were treating in our practice.
[2:39:26.440 --> 2:39:29.440]  I mentioned this on the radio a couple of days ago with you, Alex.
[2:39:29.440 --> 2:39:31.440]  This woman is a head of state.
[2:39:31.440 --> 2:39:39.440]  And she said that she had been raised to believe that the useless gears of the earth,
[2:39:39.440 --> 2:39:42.440]  that's us, our children, our friends, our family, our loved ones,
[2:39:42.440 --> 2:39:50.440]  were consuming there that the masterclass is non-renewable resources.
[2:39:50.440 --> 2:39:54.440]  And I said, and therefore they had to be eliminated, and the time was coming
[2:39:54.440 --> 2:39:57.440]  when that would finally be accomplished.
[2:39:57.440 --> 2:39:59.440]  This was in 2002.
[2:39:59.440 --> 2:40:03.440]  I believe that we are now at that next phase.
[2:40:03.440 --> 2:40:07.440]  And the tools have been put in place.
[2:40:07.440 --> 2:40:14.440]  The fear is being marshaled, managed, and very much manipulated
[2:40:14.440 --> 2:40:23.440]  to quell the populace, and the genocidal weaponization of food, of vaccines,
[2:40:23.440 --> 2:40:31.440]  of medicines has all been put in place to enact this final cleansing
[2:40:31.440 --> 2:40:36.440]  so that we do not use up their non-renewable resources.
[2:40:36.440 --> 2:40:37.440]  Let me stop you there.
[2:40:37.440 --> 2:40:41.440]  Then people say, well, they're destroying the earth's biosphere in the name of saving it,
[2:40:41.440 --> 2:40:45.440]  but they say, what you read earlier is what the head of some micro systems
[2:40:45.440 --> 2:40:48.440]  and others have said, the elite plan to kill the majority of us
[2:40:48.440 --> 2:40:51.440]  and then have a small group with this whole technological system.
[2:40:51.440 --> 2:40:55.440]  This is the official UN plan, and I want the general to comment on it after you do.
[2:40:55.440 --> 2:40:59.440]  But my question here, that's why they're creating all the governmental seed banks,
[2:40:59.440 --> 2:41:02.440]  the arcs, because they plan to release all these plagues,
[2:41:02.440 --> 2:41:05.440]  then, quote, manage it, claiming they're fighting it,
[2:41:05.440 --> 2:41:09.440]  use that as the pretext to basically exterminate the majority of us,
[2:41:09.440 --> 2:41:12.440]  and then they think they're going to put the genie back in the bottle,
[2:41:12.440 --> 2:41:17.440]  but the geneticists and the engineers I talked to, they say it probably can't be put back in.
[2:41:17.440 --> 2:41:22.440]  So at the final equation, they are completely insane,
[2:41:22.440 --> 2:41:26.440]  though they are intelligently insane with kind of a dark logic,
[2:41:26.440 --> 2:41:30.440]  or general, what would you call that?
[2:41:30.440 --> 2:41:36.440]  I'd call it stupid.
[2:41:36.440 --> 2:41:39.440]  It's very simple. I'm a simple guy.
[2:41:39.440 --> 2:41:43.440]  I think that it's crazy.
[2:41:43.440 --> 2:41:47.440]  Food as a weapon is not new.
[2:41:47.440 --> 2:41:53.440]  Sherman did a scorched earth policy during the Civil War
[2:41:53.440 --> 2:41:56.440]  when he was down in Georgia.
[2:41:56.440 --> 2:42:01.440]  He was trying to kill everybody inside,
[2:42:01.440 --> 2:42:04.440]  and he was killing the food, so he was going to kill the people.
[2:42:04.440 --> 2:42:06.440]  That's what he did.
[2:42:06.440 --> 2:42:11.440]  So this is not new in terms of a way of waging war,
[2:42:11.440 --> 2:42:16.440]  except that this now, instead of just burning everything,
[2:42:16.440 --> 2:42:21.440]  this has genetically modified ingredients,
[2:42:21.440 --> 2:42:26.440]  which they don't even have a clue which way they're going to jump,
[2:42:26.440 --> 2:42:28.440]  which way they're going to go.
[2:42:28.440 --> 2:42:33.440]  We don't know, except that we do know it is not going to be good
[2:42:33.440 --> 2:42:35.440]  for what we, for our bellies.
[2:42:35.440 --> 2:42:41.440]  And they've done tens of thousands of different ones,
[2:42:41.440 --> 2:42:44.440]  and some are going bad, some are going kind of sideways.
[2:42:44.440 --> 2:42:45.440]  None of it's good.
[2:42:45.440 --> 2:42:49.440]  And some are going to make people infertile so that there won't be any kids.
[2:42:49.440 --> 2:42:54.440]  I hope all of your listeners, Alex, know about the Austrian study
[2:42:54.440 --> 2:42:57.440]  that was released about 10 days ago,
[2:42:57.440 --> 2:43:00.440]  which shows, pardon me,
[2:43:00.440 --> 2:43:03.440]  I'm going to ask you a couple of questions.
[2:43:03.440 --> 2:43:06.440]  What are the mice?
[2:43:06.440 --> 2:43:13.440]  Two types of corn, NK603 and MON810,
[2:43:13.440 --> 2:43:16.440]  are ubiquitously approved, even in Europe,
[2:43:16.440 --> 2:43:20.440]  for animal feed and for human consumption.
[2:43:20.440 --> 2:43:24.440]  Now these corns, remember when food used to have names?
[2:43:24.440 --> 2:43:28.440]  Well, once it starts to have numbers, you're in big trouble.
[2:43:28.440 --> 2:43:31.440]  They cause infertility in mice.
[2:43:31.440 --> 2:43:33.440]  We're not very different from mice.
[2:43:33.440 --> 2:43:37.440]  If you'll notice, think about when your parents,
[2:43:37.440 --> 2:43:41.440]  or when you, if you're older than 20 or 30,
[2:43:41.440 --> 2:43:43.440]  started to have children.
[2:43:43.440 --> 2:43:48.440]  You and your friends all became pregnant pretty much when you wanted to.
[2:43:48.440 --> 2:43:51.440]  Well, at this point, the numbers of infertile couples,
[2:43:51.440 --> 2:43:55.440]  the couples, the number of people who have to go for fertility treatment
[2:43:55.440 --> 2:44:00.440]  or never do manage to become parents through biological means,
[2:44:00.440 --> 2:44:04.440]  the number of people who have huge reproductive problems
[2:44:04.440 --> 2:44:07.440]  is increasing rapidly.
[2:44:07.440 --> 2:44:10.440]  And if anybody thinks that's an accident,
[2:44:10.440 --> 2:44:12.440]  they really need to get their head out of the band.
[2:44:12.440 --> 2:44:15.440]  Well, doctor, as you know,
[2:44:15.440 --> 2:44:18.440]  that's why the main guinea pig they use is mice and rats,
[2:44:18.440 --> 2:44:23.440]  because biologically they found that mice, rats and pigs
[2:44:23.440 --> 2:44:29.440]  with cross-spectrum drugs and tests are the closest to our metabolic system.
[2:44:29.440 --> 2:44:32.440]  And so conclusively, in a whole bunch of studies,
[2:44:32.440 --> 2:44:35.440]  it's sterilizing mammals that eat all sorts of GMO,
[2:44:35.440 --> 2:44:39.440]  and that's clearly being engineered into that.
[2:44:39.440 --> 2:44:41.440]  Now, you've mentioned this head of state,
[2:44:41.440 --> 2:44:44.440]  and I know for confidentiality reasons you can't get into it,
[2:44:44.440 --> 2:44:46.440]  but specifically, flesh it out,
[2:44:46.440 --> 2:44:50.440]  was there anything else she said you haven't told us?
[2:44:50.440 --> 2:44:54.440]  Oh, yes, she said a great deal that I haven't discussed.
[2:44:54.440 --> 2:44:58.440]  One of the things that she did was bring her children to me,
[2:44:58.440 --> 2:45:00.440]  these were grown children,
[2:45:00.440 --> 2:45:04.440]  to find out whether they had been conditioned through mind control techniques
[2:45:04.440 --> 2:45:06.440]  as she believed that she had been.
[2:45:06.440 --> 2:45:08.440]  Now, remember, people say,
[2:45:08.440 --> 2:45:12.440]  well, she would know whether she was conditioned through mind control techniques.
[2:45:12.440 --> 2:45:16.440]  No, not at all, because people have their awareness compartmentalized
[2:45:16.440 --> 2:45:21.440]  through the horrific processes that are used,
[2:45:21.440 --> 2:45:25.440]  and many of the things that we call botanical ritual abuse
[2:45:25.440 --> 2:45:30.440]  are in fact mind control programs
[2:45:30.440 --> 2:45:35.440]  that are disguised in a quasi-religion of Satanism,
[2:45:35.440 --> 2:45:37.440]  which of course is no religion at all,
[2:45:37.440 --> 2:45:44.440]  but is really a political program designed to produce the desired effect in human behavior,
[2:45:44.440 --> 2:45:50.440]  because after all, just as biology and life are not sacred to these people,
[2:45:50.440 --> 2:45:58.440]  so behavior and the essence of humanity that many people call the soul is not sacred either,
[2:45:58.440 --> 2:46:00.440]  and people may say,
[2:46:00.440 --> 2:46:04.440]  my God, have they no limit to what they will invade and destroy,
[2:46:04.440 --> 2:46:06.440]  and the answer is no, they have no limit.
[2:46:06.440 --> 2:46:08.440]  Well, I've studied the globalists for a long time,
[2:46:08.440 --> 2:46:10.440]  and what you're saying is their religion is betrayal,
[2:46:10.440 --> 2:46:15.440]  their religion is defiling innocence and destroying beauty and hurting the order of things.
[2:46:15.440 --> 2:46:19.440]  They want to remake creation in their own image.
[2:46:19.440 --> 2:46:21.440]  General Stubblebine, I know it's all classified, you can't get into it,
[2:46:21.440 --> 2:46:24.440]  but you ran Special Forces, you know, there's a,
[2:46:24.440 --> 2:46:26.440]  I know you know about a film with George Clooney coming out about you,
[2:46:26.440 --> 2:46:28.440]  but the point is, I know you can't get much into it,
[2:46:28.440 --> 2:46:31.440]  but you guys were, you know, into the whole mind power,
[2:46:31.440 --> 2:46:35.440]  you know, being studied in the Army, you headed that up.
[2:46:35.440 --> 2:46:40.440]  Did you guys in your research ever run into back in that time the dark stuff
[2:46:40.440 --> 2:46:44.440]  that Dr. Lebo's talking about?
[2:46:44.440 --> 2:46:49.440]  One of the, she brought that up,
[2:46:49.440 --> 2:46:54.440]  one of the things that very interestingly came to me,
[2:46:54.440 --> 2:46:58.440]  I've got to go back into just a very quick bit of history.
[2:46:58.440 --> 2:47:01.440]  When I took over the intelligence and security command,
[2:47:01.440 --> 2:47:06.440]  which was my final command,
[2:47:06.440 --> 2:47:13.440]  actually had under me all of the Army's strategic intelligence forces around the world.
[2:47:13.440 --> 2:47:17.440]  Every one of the Army's strategic intelligence forces belonged to me,
[2:47:17.440 --> 2:47:20.440]  not the tactical, just the strategic.
[2:47:20.440 --> 2:47:23.440]  But during that period, our resources were going down
[2:47:23.440 --> 2:47:25.440]  and our requirements were going up,
[2:47:25.440 --> 2:47:30.440]  so what I did was I put together a thing I called the high performance task force,
[2:47:30.440 --> 2:47:39.440]  go out and find all of the things that would allow a person to work better,
[2:47:39.440 --> 2:47:43.440]  not longer, so that we could still meet our requirements.
[2:47:43.440 --> 2:47:48.440]  Well, out of that came some very fascinating thing,
[2:47:48.440 --> 2:47:56.440]  one of which, and this is in this stupid book about staring at goats,
[2:47:56.440 --> 2:48:03.440]  one of that item was a thing which could be used if you stared at a goat
[2:48:03.440 --> 2:48:06.440]  you could explode its heart.
[2:48:06.440 --> 2:48:09.440]  Stay there, General, we've got to talk about,
[2:48:09.440 --> 2:48:11.440]  we've got to break, we'll be back in three minutes,
[2:48:11.440 --> 2:48:13.440]  we'll finish up with this powerful information.
[2:48:13.440 --> 2:48:15.440]  Stay with us.
[2:48:15.440 --> 2:48:17.440]  Alex Jones here with a question,
[2:48:17.440 --> 2:48:19.440]  what does humidity mean to you?
[2:48:19.440 --> 2:48:21.440]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days,
[2:48:21.440 --> 2:48:27.440]  but many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[2:48:27.440 --> 2:48:29.440]  That's why I'd like you to visit,

[2:49:15.440 --> 2:49:20.440]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history,
[2:49:20.440 --> 2:49:22.440]  a terrorist act of war against this country.
[2:49:22.440 --> 2:49:24.440]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[2:49:24.440 --> 2:49:26.440]  But who is the enemy?
[2:49:26.440 --> 2:49:27.440]  Bin Laden.
[2:49:27.440 --> 2:49:28.440]  This is his MO.
[2:49:28.440 --> 2:49:29.440]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[2:49:29.440 --> 2:49:31.440]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[2:49:31.440 --> 2:49:34.440]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look
[2:49:34.440 --> 2:49:38.440]  at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[2:49:38.440 --> 2:49:41.440]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis, again,
[2:49:41.440 --> 2:49:45.440]  very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[2:49:45.440 --> 2:49:49.440]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:49:49.440 --> 2:49:51.440]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA,
[2:49:51.440 --> 2:49:53.440]  the hijackers' ties to the FBI,
[2:49:53.440 --> 2:49:54.440]  the Saudi Arabian connection,
[2:49:54.440 --> 2:49:56.440]  the Israeli intelligence network,
[2:49:56.440 --> 2:49:57.440]  warnings in war games,
[2:49:57.440 --> 2:49:58.440]  the shadow government,
[2:49:58.440 --> 2:49:59.440]  and much, much more.
[2:49:59.440 --> 2:50:00.440]  Fabled Enemies.

[2:50:18.440 --> 2:50:20.440]  due to inflammation of the arterial walls.
[2:50:20.440 --> 2:50:24.440]  Our hemp foods are anti-inflammatory and gluten-free,
[2:50:24.440 --> 2:50:27.440]  and can greatly benefit the health of the human body.
[2:50:27.440 --> 2:50:41.440]  By calling this wonderful natural food for long-term storage,

[2:50:51.440 --> 2:50:56.440]  hempUSA.org believes that now is the time to plan for the future,
[2:50:56.440 --> 2:50:59.440]  and food will be your greatest asset.
[2:50:59.440 --> 2:51:01.440]  People spend money on all kinds of things,
[2:51:01.440 --> 2:51:06.440]  but our warning is prepare now for food shortages in the future.
[2:51:06.440 --> 2:51:12.440]  So don't delay, call today, 908-691-2608,
[2:51:12.440 --> 2:51:20.440]  and see what our powder, seeds, and oil can do for you.
[2:51:20.440 --> 2:51:22.440]  OK, General.
[2:51:22.440 --> 2:51:24.440]  You were tasked with studying all this.
[2:51:24.440 --> 2:51:25.440]  The Russians were studying it.
[2:51:25.440 --> 2:51:27.440]  So they're at Fort Bragg, other places.
[2:51:27.440 --> 2:51:33.440]  You had gotten up to the point about some of the experiments with animals.
[2:51:33.440 --> 2:51:35.440]  Please continue, sir.
[2:51:35.440 --> 2:51:39.440]  What I was talking about was that I put together this high-performance task force
[2:51:39.440 --> 2:51:46.440]  to try to figure out how we could cope with the lack of resources and more requirements.
[2:51:46.440 --> 2:51:51.440]  And many, many different kinds of things appeared on my desk,
[2:51:51.440 --> 2:51:58.440]  one of which was this ability to use the mind to stare at an animal.
[2:51:58.440 --> 2:52:00.440]  It doesn't need to be a goat, but an animal.
[2:52:00.440 --> 2:52:06.440]  And with mental power, it exploded the heart.
[2:52:06.440 --> 2:52:10.440]  Well, that was not my responsibility.
[2:52:10.440 --> 2:52:14.440]  My responsibility, and I got to underscore this, Alex,
[2:52:14.440 --> 2:52:18.440]  my responsibility was the intelligence side of this thing.
[2:52:18.440 --> 2:52:23.440]  Going out and exploding somebody's heart is the operational side.
[2:52:23.440 --> 2:52:28.440]  That's the G3 instead of the G2 in military policy.
[2:52:28.440 --> 2:52:31.440]  My responsibility was intelligence.
[2:52:31.440 --> 2:52:37.440]  So when this thing appeared on my desk, and it did, there's no doubt about that,
[2:52:37.440 --> 2:52:42.440]  what I did was I took it to the Special Forces folks,
[2:52:42.440 --> 2:52:49.440]  and said, here, this is a technology that you probably need to exploit.
[2:52:49.440 --> 2:52:52.440]  This is one that you need to experiment with.
[2:52:52.440 --> 2:52:58.440]  This is in your operational side of the house, not my intelligence side of the house.
[2:52:58.440 --> 2:53:04.440]  So I literally took it down the Fort Bragg, I turned it over to them and said,
[2:53:04.440 --> 2:53:07.440]  here, you do with it what you want.
[2:53:07.440 --> 2:53:13.440]  What happened out of all of that is that everybody says, well, I'm the guy that was doing it.
[2:53:13.440 --> 2:53:15.440]  Well, the answer is no, I wasn't.
[2:53:15.440 --> 2:53:18.440]  I discovered it was brought to me.
[2:53:18.440 --> 2:53:20.440]  It appeared to work.
[2:53:20.440 --> 2:53:22.440]  I didn't play with it.
[2:53:22.440 --> 2:53:27.440]  I just took it to the people who were responsible for using it or developing it
[2:53:27.440 --> 2:53:33.440]  or training their people to use it in the case of an emergency.
[2:53:33.440 --> 2:53:34.440]  Did it work?
[2:53:34.440 --> 2:53:36.440]  I mean, is that classified?
[2:53:36.440 --> 2:53:37.440]  What's that?
[2:53:37.440 --> 2:53:39.440]  Did it work?
[2:53:39.440 --> 2:53:41.440]  I don't know.
[2:53:41.440 --> 2:53:43.440]  I really don't know.
[2:53:43.440 --> 2:53:46.440]  Let me turn it a different way.
[2:53:46.440 --> 2:53:48.440]  Do I believe it worked?
[2:53:48.440 --> 2:53:49.440]  Yes.
[2:53:49.440 --> 2:53:51.440]  Do I know that it worked?
[2:53:51.440 --> 2:53:59.440]  No, because I never tried it myself and I never saw any goat that ended up dead.
[2:53:59.440 --> 2:54:05.440]  However, I did see a number of testimonials that said that that worked.
[2:54:05.440 --> 2:54:07.440]  From the Army?
[2:54:07.440 --> 2:54:08.440]  Yes.
[2:54:08.440 --> 2:54:10.440]  Special Forces said it was working.
[2:54:10.440 --> 2:54:13.440]  They're not normally the types that just make things up internally.
[2:54:13.440 --> 2:54:18.440]  The point is, this has been on the mainstream TV that the Russians believed all this.
[2:54:18.440 --> 2:54:23.440]  I know you can't get into intelligence, but I would imagine that's where this intelligence came from.
[2:54:23.440 --> 2:54:27.440]  So the Army tested it and tried to see if it was real.
[2:54:27.440 --> 2:54:33.440]  Well, incidentally, I don't have any problem believing that it worked.
[2:54:33.440 --> 2:54:35.440]  I do have.
[2:54:35.440 --> 2:54:40.440]  I cannot say that because I have no direct information.
[2:54:40.440 --> 2:54:41.440]  I wasn't there.
[2:54:41.440 --> 2:54:42.440]  I didn't see it.
[2:54:42.440 --> 2:54:45.440]  I haven't seen one explode.
[2:54:45.440 --> 2:54:52.440]  So other than testimonials, I don't know capability.
[2:54:52.440 --> 2:54:56.440]  But BRAG is saying it worked.
[2:54:56.440 --> 2:54:57.440]  Yes.
[2:54:57.440 --> 2:55:00.440]  Or at least that's my understanding, yes.
[2:55:00.440 --> 2:55:03.440]  Well, we've kind of gotten off the tractor, but that's interesting.
[2:55:03.440 --> 2:55:08.440]  So that gets into what these elites believe and some of the things that's going on just in that little window that you saw into.
[2:55:08.440 --> 2:55:10.440]  We're going to break and start the final hour.
[2:55:10.440 --> 2:55:15.440]  I want to get into solutions with you guys and why you guys have moved to Panama.
[2:55:15.440 --> 2:55:21.440]  You're trying to teach folks how to grow organically, then export the technology all over the world so people can get ready.
[2:55:21.440 --> 2:55:24.440]  Dr. Labo has talked a lot about this.
[2:55:24.440 --> 2:55:29.440]  You guys had a very successful practice in all sorts of organizations and foundations here in the U.S.
[2:55:29.440 --> 2:55:35.440]  So I'll ask you when we get back in one minute or 70 seconds technically why you've decided to go down to Panama.
[2:55:35.440 --> 2:55:39.440]  Last time I talked to you a year ago or so, you guys were still coming back to the U.S. some.
[2:55:39.440 --> 2:55:40.440]  Now you're not.
[2:55:40.440 --> 2:55:47.440]  And we've got to talk about what happened at the Codex Alimentarius meeting a few months ago that you covered in Europe as well.
[2:55:47.440 --> 2:55:54.440]  So our amazing guest with us for one more hour straight ahead, HealthFreedomUSA.org is their website.
[2:55:54.440 --> 2:55:59.440]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[2:57:08.440 --> 2:57:16.440]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:57:16.440 --> 2:57:33.440]  Alright, we're now in to the final hour.
[2:57:33.440 --> 2:57:37.440]  This is a quick five minute segment, but a long segment coming up with both of our guests joining us.
[2:57:37.440 --> 2:57:46.440]  My website's infowars.com or prisonplanet.com, Jonesreport.com, their site's HealthFreedomUSA.org.
[2:57:46.440 --> 2:57:49.440]  We're going to put that up on the screen. Again, we're now live at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:57:49.440 --> 2:57:53.440]  We've been live for the last 55 minutes.
[2:57:53.440 --> 2:58:02.440]  And we are talking to Major General Albert Bertin Stubblebein, the third U.S. Army retired, can read his bio at healthfreedomusa.org,
[2:58:02.440 --> 2:58:08.440]  and his wife, Rima E. LeBeau, MD, graduate of Albert Einstein College of Medicine.
[2:58:08.440 --> 2:58:18.440]  There's so much to get into. I mean, perhaps we should get a report from you guys about going to Codex Alimentarius UN meeting and what it is and how they're trying to block our access.
[2:58:18.440 --> 2:58:23.440]  I mean, here's an example. Toronto bans bottled water sales, but junk sodas remain legal.
[2:58:23.440 --> 2:58:28.440]  That's natural news, Mike Adams, that you guys work some with. Another great guy.
[2:58:28.440 --> 2:58:33.440]  And again, if they can ban bottled water, they can start banning other foods.
[2:58:33.440 --> 2:58:37.440]  This is setting precedence. Tell us what's going on with that.
[2:58:37.440 --> 2:58:47.440]  Well, what's going on with that is that Codex Alimentarius is designed to make it impossible to get healthy food anywhere.
[2:58:47.440 --> 2:58:52.440]  And the reason that we came to Panama is directly related to that.
[2:58:52.440 --> 2:59:03.440]  Indeed, General Stubblebine and I have been met at gunpoint in a public meeting, a Codex Alimentarius commission meeting, which is their annual big meeting,
[2:59:03.440 --> 2:59:11.440]  where they ratify the harm that each of the committees is doing and move it forward and make it global policy.
[2:59:11.440 --> 2:59:14.440]  We have been met at gunpoint.
[2:59:14.440 --> 2:59:21.440]  Can I correct one thing? The gun wasn't pointing at us. The guns were actually in their holsters, but they did have guns.
[2:59:21.440 --> 2:59:25.440]  That's what she's talking about when they came to get it.
[2:59:25.440 --> 2:59:29.440]  And this is not something that other observers were treated to.
[2:59:29.440 --> 2:59:30.440]  None.
[2:59:30.440 --> 2:59:33.440]  None. We were sequestered. There was a...
[2:59:33.440 --> 2:59:37.440]  The main meeting room had about 180 empty seats.
[2:59:37.440 --> 2:59:43.440]  And we were in the fourth floor gallery, way up above with a guard at the door.
[2:59:43.440 --> 2:59:48.440]  And any time either one of us tried to go to the bathroom or to get lunch or whatever,
[2:59:48.440 --> 2:59:51.440]  they followed by the guards and kept away from the delegates.
[2:59:51.440 --> 2:59:59.440]  Well, how stupid, because we visit the delegates and the heads of state and the members of parliament in the developing world in their own countries,
[2:59:59.440 --> 3:00:02.440]  and there are no guards there yet, anyway, keeping us away.
[3:00:02.440 --> 3:00:07.440]  Why did they need to keep us two ordinary unarmed citizens?
[3:00:07.440 --> 3:00:15.440]  There were only a hundred extra seats, and we were told that there were no extra seats, so we had to go into the upper balcony.
[3:00:15.440 --> 3:00:19.440]  Why did they choose to do that, to perpetrate that lie?
[3:00:19.440 --> 3:00:22.440]  Well, obviously, because we're being very, very effective.
[3:00:22.440 --> 3:00:39.440]  Now, at the last Codex meeting that we attended, we were able to galvanize the African nations in their opposition to having GM food and seeds rust down their throats
[3:00:39.440 --> 3:00:43.440]  to kill them, to sterilize them, and so on, because they know the score.
[3:00:43.440 --> 3:00:51.440]  And tragically, the last Codex meeting that we wanted to attend, which was in South Africa at the beginning of November,
[3:00:51.440 --> 3:00:59.440]  dealt very much with the issue of genetically modified food and toxins for babies and for sick people.
[3:00:59.440 --> 3:01:07.440]  And when we have attended these meetings, we've been able to achieve striking positive forward movement,
[3:01:07.440 --> 3:01:18.440]  spanning fluoride from formula for normal infants to our efforts at the same committee meeting in Thailand two years ago.
[3:01:18.440 --> 3:01:21.440]  That was an incredible victory.
[3:01:21.440 --> 3:01:32.440]  It was brought about by presenting science and by using the coalition of the unwilling that we have spent years creating at this last meeting of the same committee,
[3:01:32.440 --> 3:01:39.440]  the Committee on Nutrition and Food for Special Dietary Uses that was meeting in November in South Africa that I mentioned,
[3:01:39.440 --> 3:01:42.440]  we weren't there. Why weren't we there?
[3:01:42.440 --> 3:01:52.440]  Because the economic crisis had hit and our donations had plummeted to the point where we literally could not afford the airfare,
[3:01:52.440 --> 3:01:58.440]  we could not afford the hotel, we could not afford to go to this meeting.
[3:01:58.440 --> 3:02:03.440]  Now, that's not okay because we are totally donor supported.
[3:02:03.440 --> 3:02:04.440]  We have no support.
[3:02:04.440 --> 3:02:07.440]  We'll stay there. We're going to try to fix that. Stay there, doctor. We got a break.
[3:02:07.440 --> 3:02:12.440]  Come back. We'll try to fix that right now because I've been tracking this and you guys are doing so much of the work.
[3:02:12.440 --> 3:02:16.440]  There's literally nobody going to these meetings and resisting and educating.
[3:02:16.440 --> 3:02:18.440]  Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones.
[3:02:18.440 --> 3:02:21.440]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient.
[3:02:21.440 --> 3:02:23.440]  And today that's more important than ever.
[3:02:23.440 --> 3:02:26.440]  We need to be independent and food and water is the key.
[3:02:26.440 --> 3:02:29.440]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[3:02:29.440 --> 3:02:35.440]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[3:02:35.440 --> 3:02:41.440]  Our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout for a special interest, so they ignored your screams not to do it.
[3:02:41.440 --> 3:02:46.440]  They turned off the telephones and e-mail. They voted to print $850 billion at least out of thin air.
[3:02:46.440 --> 3:02:49.440]  This money now owns the American and European banks.
[3:02:49.440 --> 3:02:55.440]  The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities,
[3:02:55.440 --> 3:02:58.440]  particularly food, beyond many Americans' reach.
[3:02:58.440 --> 3:03:05.440]  In pre-Nazi Germany's superinflation, the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days until it reached over 4 billion marks.
[3:03:05.440 --> 3:03:10.440]  Food prices are skyrocketing so fast, there seems as if there may be no end in sight.
[3:03:10.440 --> 3:03:15.440]  The private banks, merging with our government, are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves.
[3:03:15.440 --> 3:03:18.440]  The stores have less food but jack of prices to stay in business.
[3:03:18.440 --> 3:03:22.440]  Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared and be ready.
[3:03:22.440 --> 3:03:28.440]  Everything is zeroing in on food. One third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities.
[3:03:28.440 --> 3:03:32.440]  My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared, get self-sufficient, get food.
[3:03:32.440 --> 3:03:37.440]  For everybody out there listening, it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food,
[3:03:37.440 --> 3:03:43.440]  the government, the new old order has a lot less control over you and so it's a mindset, a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness.
[3:03:43.440 --> 3:03:47.440]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[3:03:47.440 --> 3:03:54.440]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration or Chinese imports
[3:03:54.440 --> 3:03:57.440]  and they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[3:03:57.440 --> 3:04:02.440]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[3:04:02.440 --> 3:04:08.440]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the final list of high quality, freeze-dried and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[3:04:08.440 --> 3:04:15.440]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633
[3:04:15.440 --> 3:04:20.440]  or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[3:04:20.440 --> 3:04:23.440]  Take action today, the first step is getting storable food.
[3:04:23.440 --> 3:04:31.440]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[3:04:31.440 --> 3:04:35.440]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:04:35.440 --> 3:04:53.440]  All right, Dr. Rima Lebo is our guest MD and of course Major General Albert Stubblebine, the former head of Army Special Forces and the head of Army Intelligence.
[3:04:53.440 --> 3:04:56.440]  We're honored to have them both with us today.
[3:04:56.440 --> 3:05:12.440]  You were continuing Dr. Lebo to walk through the fact that I have books, videos, products, advertising that funds my operation and I have to spend most of my time and I'm not whining about it, trying to raise money just to then have the money to do the broadcast, do the websites, make the films.
[3:05:12.440 --> 3:05:20.440]  And I understand this capitalization issue and you guys have dropped everything the last few many years just to fight this and you're now in Panama.
[3:05:20.440 --> 3:05:29.440]  We'll get into that operation you're doing to try to get a truly sustainable community outside of this corrupt vortex.
[3:05:29.440 --> 3:05:31.440]  But yeah, tell folks about your free mailing list.
[3:05:31.440 --> 3:05:35.440]  Tell folks they want to donate what that money will go to.
[3:05:35.440 --> 3:05:38.440]  Absolutely.
[3:05:38.440 --> 3:05:52.440]  Bert and I closed our medical practice, which did supply us with an income and allow us to have a lovely home and do the things that we enjoy doing, skiing and dancing and so on.
[3:05:52.440 --> 3:06:03.440]  Because this is a war and there is great evil afoot and those who stand by while evil is being perpetrated become perpetrators themselves.
[3:06:03.440 --> 3:06:05.440]  That motivates you Alex, it motivates us.
[3:06:05.440 --> 3:06:12.440]  So we closed our practice in late 2004 and we created the Natural Solutions Foundation.
[3:06:12.440 --> 3:06:27.440]  We created a website, healthfreedomusa.org and then we applied the strategic and analytical skills that we used so successfully in our prior careers.
[3:06:27.440 --> 3:06:35.440]  Bert as a general involved in strategic intelligence and I as a physician treating cases where nothing else had worked.
[3:06:35.440 --> 3:06:44.440]  And by the way, the official medical phrase when something hasn't worked is that, and you'll love this, the patient has failed therapy.
[3:06:44.440 --> 3:06:49.440]  Not that therapy has failed the patient, but that the patient has failed therapy.
[3:06:49.440 --> 3:06:55.440]  We closed that in order to take on this global health freedom problem.
[3:06:55.440 --> 3:07:07.440]  And one of the things that I do very well as a diagnostician in medicine is look at the whole picture and find the basic underlying error.
[3:07:07.440 --> 3:07:17.440]  Either an error of metabolism or a toxification or a genetic problem or whatever and use that as my fulcrum.
[3:07:17.440 --> 3:07:23.440]  The point at which by applying the lever of intervention I can get the greatest result.
[3:07:23.440 --> 3:07:35.440]  So when we looked at this codex alimentarius, genocide, weaponization of food, tyrannical disfoilment of the environment and so on.
[3:07:35.440 --> 3:07:43.440]  And the murder of the constitutional body politic in the United States and elsewhere.
[3:07:43.440 --> 3:07:57.440]  I said, okay, what is the single central item here which has to be reclaimed, redefined and put back into the hands of people in order to fix the whole damn system.
[3:07:57.440 --> 3:08:01.440]  And the answer is food.
[3:08:01.440 --> 3:08:05.440]  He who controls the world, food controls the world.
[3:08:05.440 --> 3:08:12.440]  That is the system that is being used at the center of world domination.
[3:08:12.440 --> 3:08:19.440]  I don't know whether other people have identified this, this crucial issue or not, but the fact is that's our analysis.
[3:08:19.440 --> 3:08:31.440]  And so we created the International Decade of Nutrition, the IDN, as part of the work of the Natural Solutions Foundation.
[3:08:31.440 --> 3:08:44.440]  And we said we need to return the production of food to the people, to the farmers so they can feed their community themselves and their social system can remain intact.
[3:08:44.440 --> 3:08:54.440]  They're not driven off their land by the multinational corporations so that they go to the city, become the abjectly poor, starve and die,
[3:08:54.440 --> 3:09:01.440]  but instead become what they have always been, the people who essentially hold up society with food.
[3:09:01.440 --> 3:09:07.440]  And that's what globalization, by the way, by design, as you know, Dr. Labo, in general, some of them for the audience may not.
[3:09:07.440 --> 3:09:12.440]  Gen. 21, all of this states, force the people, take Mexico as a microcosm.
[3:09:12.440 --> 3:09:17.440]  Over the last 30 years, they forced the indigenous people off their cornfields where they've been for thousands of years.
[3:09:17.440 --> 3:09:25.440]  They forced them into Mexico City, now 35 million people, around a third of the children born with a syndrome where they have the tiny brain,
[3:09:25.440 --> 3:09:28.440]  zombies basically, you know, they never even developed, they die.
[3:09:28.440 --> 3:09:35.440]  That's then a staging ground to move them to the United States to then drive down wages and break down the system here.
[3:09:35.440 --> 3:09:40.440]  Globalization is a war against the middle class and against the poor by the elites.
[3:09:40.440 --> 3:09:43.440]  And people need to go to your website, donate, support it.
[3:09:43.440 --> 3:09:48.440]  I think it's very worthwhile, but also spread the word about what you're doing and take the materials you've developed
[3:09:48.440 --> 3:09:53.440]  and deploy that with these natural systems of growing.
[3:09:53.440 --> 3:10:01.440]  I mean, you've developed some wonderful systems, so let's talk about some of those as well and then get Gen. Stubblebine to chime in.
[3:10:01.440 --> 3:10:03.440]  But please continue.
[3:10:03.440 --> 3:10:14.440]  Let me suggest, thank you, Alex, let me suggest that people go to our website and view a video there called Neutricide, N-U-T-R-I-C-I-D-E.
[3:10:14.440 --> 3:10:23.440]  This is of extreme importance, and by the way, Alex, we have to work out a way that you can carry this as part of the wonderful information that you disseminate.
[3:10:23.440 --> 3:10:37.440]  This Neutricide talks about the fact that this food genocide came out of World War II when the Nazi genocide failed, and it's tied intimately to the pharmaceutical industry.
[3:10:37.440 --> 3:10:48.440]  To go on, we decided that we had to put, we had to demonstrate that it was possible to end world hunger and therefore eliminate 90% of world disease.
[3:10:48.440 --> 3:10:52.440]  And let me very quickly deal with the overpopulation issue.
[3:10:52.440 --> 3:10:55.440]  People say, yeah, but there really are too many people.
[3:10:55.440 --> 3:11:09.440]  The surest, quickest and most efficient way to bring down the birth rate on a voluntary basis and enhance the quality of life in the community is to educate women, not to sterilize men and women.
[3:11:09.440 --> 3:11:12.440]  So we're talking about an alternative there.
[3:11:12.440 --> 3:11:19.440]  Women need to be educated, and that works in every culture, whether it's Muslim or Christian or atheist or whatever.
[3:11:19.440 --> 3:11:27.440]  So we decided that we needed to reclaim the production of food and demonstrate that it was possible to eliminate world hunger.
[3:11:27.440 --> 3:11:39.440]  We have some astounding technologies which have absolutely no environmental downside, but can increase food production by up to 600%.
[3:11:39.440 --> 3:11:44.440]  Can increase nutrient density in food by up to 600%.
[3:11:44.440 --> 3:11:50.440]  That is simple to use. You don't have to put in electricity. You don't have to be able to read and write.
[3:11:50.440 --> 3:11:55.440]  We're teaching farmers, or we intend to teach farmers exactly how to do that.
[3:11:55.440 --> 3:12:10.440]  At the same time, we intend to, by working with Father Godfrey and Zamajou from Benin, Africa, create an educational system here in Panama where we can teach farmers how to farm without pollution
[3:12:10.440 --> 3:12:21.440]  and how to create their own energy supply through methane digestion using the waste of the farm, human waste, animal waste, and agricultural waste.
[3:12:21.440 --> 3:12:30.440]  We don't need petroleum to have light, to have energy to run our cars. Absolutely irrelevant.
[3:12:30.440 --> 3:12:41.440]  We, besides the fact that it's so damaging economically and environmentally, we can teach farmers how to bring that to their communities.
[3:12:41.440 --> 3:12:45.440]  So we came to Panama and we selected Panama for many, many reasons.
[3:12:45.440 --> 3:12:54.440]  And by the way, the place on the planet most likely to weather this economic cataclysm that's been delivered to us and will get worse and worse, we believe,
[3:12:54.440 --> 3:13:01.440]  the place best suited for stability economically is Panama. Very interesting.
[3:13:01.440 --> 3:13:08.440]  At the same time, we did not choose the hot, picky areas of Panama.
[3:13:08.440 --> 3:13:21.440]  We chose the highlands of Panama, temperate, beautiful, bountiful, year-long, spring-like weather, which means we have a 365-day growing season.
[3:13:21.440 --> 3:13:31.440]  And the foundation, Natural Solutions Foundation, has been able to purchase a piece of land that currently has two houses and will house a natural medical center
[3:13:31.440 --> 3:13:48.440]  and a series of teaching facilities and a farm with five commercial greenhouses on it, which will allow us to protect against genetically modified genetic drift.
[3:13:48.440 --> 3:13:53.440]  And by the way, as you know, I mean, a lot of other people are getting concerned and trying to do similar things.
[3:13:53.440 --> 3:14:04.440]  People, not just from the alternative media, but instinctively are moving out to farms, moving out to homesteads, are getting heirloom seeds, are getting ready.
[3:14:04.440 --> 3:14:08.440]  So I commend the research you're doing because that's going to help so many people.
[3:14:08.440 --> 3:14:10.440]  So folks that want to find out more.
[3:14:10.440 --> 3:14:24.440]  They better be thinking about it and better be taking action, not just thinking about it. They need to take action now, because if they don't, they're going to be missing the food that they need to sustain themselves.
[3:14:24.440 --> 3:14:25.440]  Well, General, what would victory...
[3:14:25.440 --> 3:14:27.440]  Not everybody moves to a farm, Alex.
[3:14:27.440 --> 3:14:29.440]  Victory gardens.
[3:14:29.440 --> 3:14:31.440]  Absolutely.
[3:14:31.440 --> 3:14:37.440]  I don't know how many listeners remember the Victory Gardens or have read about the Victory Gardens of World War II,
[3:14:37.440 --> 3:14:52.440]  but in order to save petroleum, in order to save labor, in order to allow people to continue to work in the industries that were producing the war machine,
[3:14:52.440 --> 3:15:01.440]  people were told that they needed to grow their own food, and that would help speed the victory against the enemy, the Germans and the Japanese.
[3:15:01.440 --> 3:15:03.440]  And indeed, people did grow their own food.
[3:15:03.440 --> 3:15:12.440]  They created what were called Victory Gardens, and they remembered again, even urbanized people, remembered again how to grow their own food.
[3:15:12.440 --> 3:15:15.440]  Well, we need Victory Gardens on steroids.
[3:15:15.440 --> 3:15:16.440]  And it's also fun.
[3:15:16.440 --> 3:15:18.440]  Well, I'll tell you what's happening in Austin.
[3:15:18.440 --> 3:15:24.440]  A lot of people are going out to pieces of property two, three, four acres and just growing masses of food.
[3:15:24.440 --> 3:15:32.440]  I know one fellow from his grandparents gave him, I think it's like 20 acres, the middle of town, and he's got a huge garden there with two growing seasons a year.
[3:15:32.440 --> 3:15:36.440]  And so, absolutely, this is what humans are designed to do.
[3:15:36.440 --> 3:15:39.440]  So I hope folks will visit HealthFreedomUSA.org.
[3:15:39.440 --> 3:15:41.440]  They can sign up for your news alerts and information.
[3:15:41.440 --> 3:15:46.440]  They can get the videos and materials there on the site, and that will certainly support them.
[3:15:46.440 --> 3:15:49.440]  We invite people to come visit.
[3:15:49.440 --> 3:16:00.440]  We invite people to come learn, because we're going to be teaching urban people how to grow enough food to see the family of four in four feet of
[3:16:00.440 --> 3:16:10.440]  square foot space, four square feet, and feed a family of four fresh vegetables for an entire year with virtually no cost.
[3:16:10.440 --> 3:16:13.440]  You can do that in your apartment with a couple of grow lights.
[3:16:13.440 --> 3:16:17.440]  This is something that every single person can do, a movie, a movie, a new newsletter.
[3:16:17.440 --> 3:16:18.440]  Okay, stay there.
[3:16:18.440 --> 3:16:19.440]  We've got a break.
[3:16:19.440 --> 3:16:20.440]  We've got a break.
[3:16:20.440 --> 3:16:24.440]  And in fact, we'll probably just skip this break, but here we go.
[3:16:24.440 --> 3:16:26.440]  Now that the election is over, and the shopping is getting into the world.
[3:16:26.440 --> 3:16:29.440]  Okay, I'm going to skip this break, John, for the Internet-only audience.
[3:16:29.440 --> 3:16:33.440]  Dr. Labo and General Stubblebine, we're going to be back to the full audience in a couple of minutes.
[3:16:33.440 --> 3:16:38.440]  I want to now shift gears, and I understand getting prepared, getting ready is the way to go.
[3:16:38.440 --> 3:16:44.440]  But, I mean, obviously, you know videos are the way to really educate the whole world who can't come to Panama.
[3:16:44.440 --> 3:16:47.440]  And I know you guys have produced some great documentaries and talks.
[3:16:47.440 --> 3:16:52.440]  Are you planning to make some videos about what you're showing and doing down there?
[3:16:52.440 --> 3:16:53.440]  Yes.
[3:16:53.440 --> 3:17:00.440]  And as a matter of fact, if you want to co-op that one, if you want to collaborate on that, Alex, I'd be thrilled.
[3:17:00.440 --> 3:17:04.440]  Well, I'd love to, and I'm always pinned down here putting out a million different fires.
[3:17:04.440 --> 3:17:08.440]  But, you know, I wouldn't mind coming down and seeing your operation in Panama.
[3:17:08.440 --> 3:17:10.440]  We'd love to have you.
[3:17:10.440 --> 3:17:13.440]  I've been down to Central America, but I've never been to Panama.
[3:17:13.440 --> 3:17:15.440]  We'd love to have you, Alex.
[3:17:15.440 --> 3:17:16.440]  Absolutely.
[3:17:16.440 --> 3:17:22.440]  Well, what I'll do then is I'll certainly try to figure out some time to get down there before everything goes to hell in a handbasket.
[3:17:22.440 --> 3:17:29.440]  You know, I envy you guys being up there in the mountain rainforest, because I'm right here in the...
[3:17:29.440 --> 3:17:31.440]  Beautiful.
[3:17:31.440 --> 3:17:33.440]  I bet it is magnificent.
[3:17:33.440 --> 3:17:36.440]  The facility here is almost beyond imagining.
[3:17:36.440 --> 3:17:40.440]  You stick anything in the ground and it flourishes.
[3:17:40.440 --> 3:17:49.440]  Unfortunately, even though it's illegal in Panama, the government of Panama is releasing genetically modified organisms at a ferocious cliff.
[3:17:49.440 --> 3:17:56.440]  And I have compiled a dossier on that and have presented it to a number of people that I thought might be able to do something about it.
[3:17:56.440 --> 3:17:58.440]  Hey, that is my next question.
[3:17:58.440 --> 3:18:00.440]  We'll be back in two minutes.
[3:18:00.440 --> 3:18:08.440]  I want to get into that area because I was going to ask you about Brazil and Panama and Africa and even in the U.S. and Canada.
[3:18:08.440 --> 3:18:09.440]  They've caught them.
[3:18:09.440 --> 3:18:15.440]  This has been in major news, as you know, for the audience, where companies are putting their seeds out,
[3:18:15.440 --> 3:18:23.440]  planning their test fields next to major farming growth belts of similar crops to contaminate everything.
[3:18:23.440 --> 3:18:24.440]  And I want to talk about that agenda.
[3:18:24.440 --> 3:18:26.440]  And General Stubblebine can speak to this.
[3:18:26.440 --> 3:18:28.440]  Take Iraq.
[3:18:28.440 --> 3:18:34.440]  One of the first things they did was make the Iraqis only take GMO crops.
[3:18:34.440 --> 3:18:35.440]  That's right.
[3:18:35.440 --> 3:18:37.440]  Exactly right.
[3:18:37.440 --> 3:18:38.440]  So again...
[3:18:38.440 --> 3:18:39.440]  I think it is.
[3:18:39.440 --> 3:18:42.440]  I recall it's in their constitution that that's the only thing they can use.
[3:18:42.440 --> 3:18:48.440]  Yes, so reading the IMF and World Bank documents, the U.N. Biological Diversity Assessments and others,
[3:18:48.440 --> 3:18:50.440]  they admit this is a weapon.
[3:18:50.440 --> 3:18:52.440]  This isn't even denied.
[3:18:52.440 --> 3:18:56.440]  And so it's all about destroying these ancient cultures, these ancient varieties,
[3:18:56.440 --> 3:19:00.440]  making these countries dependent when only GMO is in their country.
[3:19:00.440 --> 3:19:02.440]  And I know you guys know this better than I do.
[3:19:02.440 --> 3:19:04.440]  But for the audience, some may not know it.
[3:19:04.440 --> 3:19:10.440]  Let's walk through what they're doing in Iraq, what they're doing in Africa, what you've caught them doing in Panama.
[3:19:10.440 --> 3:19:18.440]  I know in Brazil, it's super illegal, but they go in spending money to contaminate things and why that's so important.
[3:19:18.440 --> 3:19:20.440]  We'll be back in one minute, okay?
[3:19:20.440 --> 3:19:42.440]  Here we go.
[3:19:50.440 --> 3:20:00.440]  We'll be back in a minute.
[3:20:20.440 --> 3:20:30.440]  He's going the distance.
[3:20:30.440 --> 3:20:40.440]  He's going for speed.
[3:20:40.440 --> 3:20:50.440]  He's going the distance.
[3:20:50.440 --> 3:20:54.440]  Yeah, we are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:20:54.440 --> 3:20:58.440]  We've got about 40 minutes left with our guest.
[3:20:58.440 --> 3:21:00.440]  I guess 36 minutes to be technical.
[3:21:00.440 --> 3:21:04.440]  I want to take a few calls for our guest specifically on Codex Alimentarius,
[3:21:04.440 --> 3:21:08.440]  specifically on GMO, the poisons, the toxins in the food,
[3:21:08.440 --> 3:21:14.440]  coming up in the next final segments at 1-800-2599-231.
[3:21:14.440 --> 3:21:20.440]  Next on my list, I had Iraq forcing them in their constitution to only grow GMO.
[3:21:20.440 --> 3:21:22.440]  I mean, that's tyranny right there.
[3:21:22.440 --> 3:21:26.440]  Even if GMO was, quote, good, why make them only buy it from Monsanto?
[3:21:26.440 --> 3:21:30.440]  Again, they want to set precedents, go in, take over these ancient cultures.
[3:21:30.440 --> 3:21:32.440]  This is a weaponized system.
[3:21:32.440 --> 3:21:38.440]  General Stubblebine speak to Iraq, and then Dr. Labo has been exposing, just in Panama,
[3:21:38.440 --> 3:21:42.440]  how the internationalists are coming in at great expense to literally contaminate things
[3:21:42.440 --> 3:21:44.440]  with this even when it's illegal.
[3:21:44.440 --> 3:21:50.440]  Well, in Iraq, they couldn't even save their native seeds.
[3:21:50.440 --> 3:21:54.440]  In other words, they had to use the GMO.
[3:21:54.440 --> 3:22:01.440]  I mean, it's absolutely crazy when you tell a person that it's illegal to save his seed
[3:22:01.440 --> 3:22:04.440]  from his last crop so that he can grow the next one.
[3:22:04.440 --> 3:22:06.440]  But that's what they're doing.
[3:22:06.440 --> 3:22:09.440]  And then they give them nothing but the GMO.
[3:22:09.440 --> 3:22:12.440]  So now they're totally dependent upon the GMO.
[3:22:12.440 --> 3:22:15.440]  The first year, a lot of times, they give it to them free.
[3:22:15.440 --> 3:22:19.440]  The next year, of course, they have to pay for it.
[3:22:19.440 --> 3:22:22.440]  And of course, they don't have enough money to pay for it.
[3:22:22.440 --> 3:22:28.440]  So now their destitute and off their farm and the large commercial outfits
[3:22:28.440 --> 3:22:33.440]  have taken over all of the little tiny farmers' plots.
[3:22:33.440 --> 3:22:38.440]  So if you think that that isn't just excruciating to watch,
[3:22:38.440 --> 3:22:41.440]  and we have seen it in India over and over and over again,
[3:22:41.440 --> 3:22:45.440]  where I'm sure I haven't seen it in Iraq,
[3:22:45.440 --> 3:22:48.440]  but I am sure that it's happening in Iraq,
[3:22:48.440 --> 3:22:54.440]  and I would not be a bit surprised if we don't see it in other parts of the world.
[3:22:54.440 --> 3:22:57.440]  We have literally seen it in India.
[3:22:57.440 --> 3:22:59.440]  If there's any question that they're diabolical,
[3:22:59.440 --> 3:23:01.440]  showing up with men and guns and saying,
[3:23:01.440 --> 3:23:03.440]  you can't plant your ancient varieties.
[3:23:03.440 --> 3:23:06.440]  You must buy GMO from us.
[3:23:06.440 --> 3:23:08.440]  And then it has terminator genes.
[3:23:08.440 --> 3:23:09.440]  They can't get seeds.
[3:23:09.440 --> 3:23:10.440]  It's patented.
[3:23:10.440 --> 3:23:11.440]  They come in.
[3:23:11.440 --> 3:23:14.440]  I mean, this is total tyranny.
[3:23:14.440 --> 3:23:16.440]  It's not crazy that you're evil, though.
[3:23:16.440 --> 3:23:17.440]  I mean, out in the open.
[3:23:17.440 --> 3:23:18.440]  And then here it is.
[3:23:18.440 --> 3:23:22.440]  Toronto Bands Bottle Water Sales Citywide, but junk sodas remain legal.
[3:23:22.440 --> 3:23:25.440]  Again, they want you drinking the fluoride water.
[3:23:25.440 --> 3:23:28.440]  But again, the precedent of telling Canadians,
[3:23:28.440 --> 3:23:30.440]  and now San Francisco is trying it,
[3:23:30.440 --> 3:23:33.440]  you can't drink the water you want.
[3:23:33.440 --> 3:23:37.440]  I mean, this is an incredible precedent of tyranny.
[3:23:37.440 --> 3:23:38.440]  Yes.
[3:23:38.440 --> 3:23:40.440]  Yes.
[3:23:40.440 --> 3:23:41.440]  Yes.
[3:23:41.440 --> 3:23:42.440]  Unbelievable.
[3:23:42.440 --> 3:23:46.440]  And I find it, again, excruciatingly painful
[3:23:46.440 --> 3:23:50.440]  to have people allow that to occur.
[3:23:50.440 --> 3:23:54.440]  You know, if the government says that you can't drink the water,
[3:23:54.440 --> 3:23:58.440]  then somebody ought to say, oh no, not on my watch.
[3:23:58.440 --> 3:24:00.440]  Let me jump in here.
[3:24:00.440 --> 3:24:04.440]  Not only are we talking about the 128,000 Gujarati farmers
[3:24:04.440 --> 3:24:07.440]  who have killed themselves because of GMO cotton,
[3:24:07.440 --> 3:24:10.440]  directly because of GMO cotton.
[3:24:10.440 --> 3:24:12.440]  And that's mainstream news.
[3:24:12.440 --> 3:24:13.440]  Pardon me?
[3:24:13.440 --> 3:24:14.440]  I mean, that's admitted, by the way.
[3:24:14.440 --> 3:24:15.440]  They're just killing themselves.
[3:24:15.440 --> 3:24:16.440]  Explain that.
[3:24:16.440 --> 3:24:18.440]  What's happening in India?
[3:24:18.440 --> 3:24:23.440]  What happens is that the GMO seed is given to the farmer.
[3:24:23.440 --> 3:24:28.440]  Now, remember, farmers in most of the world are marginal people
[3:24:28.440 --> 3:24:30.440]  in terms of the money economy.
[3:24:30.440 --> 3:24:31.440]  They're on the edge.
[3:24:31.440 --> 3:24:33.440]  They hold up, but they have no money.
[3:24:33.440 --> 3:24:37.440]  And if their crop fails, they're in very big trouble.
[3:24:37.440 --> 3:24:41.440]  So the GMO people come along, Monsanto comes along,
[3:24:41.440 --> 3:24:43.440]  and they give farmers GMO cotton.
[3:24:43.440 --> 3:24:45.440]  And the operative word is give.
[3:24:45.440 --> 3:24:49.440]  Give farmers GMO cotton seed for free the first year.
[3:24:49.440 --> 3:24:51.440]  And they say, don't worry about it.
[3:24:51.440 --> 3:24:55.440]  You'll pay me next because this crop will resist drought.
[3:24:55.440 --> 3:24:58.440]  It will prove to be much more productive.
[3:24:58.440 --> 3:24:59.440]  You'll get more crop.
[3:24:59.440 --> 3:25:00.440]  You'll be rich.
[3:25:00.440 --> 3:25:03.440]  And you can pay me next year for this seed.
[3:25:03.440 --> 3:25:06.440]  And the farmer says, oh, wonderful.
[3:25:06.440 --> 3:25:10.440]  Plant the GMO crop, which requires more pesticide
[3:25:10.440 --> 3:25:13.440]  because the GMO crops have in large measure
[3:25:13.440 --> 3:25:17.440]  been created in order to consume high levels of pesticide.
[3:25:17.440 --> 3:25:20.440]  And the pesticides are like glyphosate.
[3:25:20.440 --> 3:25:24.440]  The second most toxic chemical, non-ionizing
[3:25:24.440 --> 3:25:29.440]  radiation chemical known, known to provide to cause cancer.
[3:25:29.440 --> 3:25:33.440]  And I saw mainline news that these GMO
[3:25:33.440 --> 3:25:37.440]  cottons leach poison into you when you wear it.
[3:25:37.440 --> 3:25:38.440]  Exactly.
[3:25:38.440 --> 3:25:41.440]  And we've run a whole series on more gallons,
[3:25:41.440 --> 3:25:44.440]  which is a nightmare brought to you from above
[3:25:44.440 --> 3:25:48.440]  through the chem trail spraying and from your clothing
[3:25:48.440 --> 3:25:50.440]  through the GMO modification.
[3:25:50.440 --> 3:25:53.440]  We're talking about an intolerably horrible disease.
[3:25:53.440 --> 3:25:54.440]  You know what?
[3:25:54.440 --> 3:25:56.440]  I'm going to skip this break so we have time here.
[3:25:56.440 --> 3:25:58.440]  We're going to break about 20 seconds on the internet.
[3:25:58.440 --> 3:25:59.440]  We'll still be live.
[3:25:59.440 --> 3:26:00.440]  We're going to come back and take calls.
[3:26:00.440 --> 3:26:02.440]  But when we get back, I want to ask General Stubblebine
[3:26:02.440 --> 3:26:04.440]  about chem trails, his expert opinion on that,
[3:26:04.440 --> 3:26:05.440]  as well as Dr. Leibo.
[3:26:05.440 --> 3:26:08.440]  But let's continue talking about how they're forcing
[3:26:08.440 --> 3:26:14.440]  the GMO into countries right now with our guest.
[3:26:14.440 --> 3:26:16.440]  OK, let's continue, though, then let's come back
[3:26:16.440 --> 3:26:17.440]  with more gallons and back with chem trails.
[3:26:17.440 --> 3:26:18.440]  OK.
[3:26:18.440 --> 3:26:19.440]  For the full audience, we've got...
[3:26:19.440 --> 3:26:24.440]  The GMO cottons sell because it's not drought resistant.
[3:26:24.440 --> 3:26:27.440]  The farmers go bankrupt because they have to keep using
[3:26:27.440 --> 3:26:29.440]  more and more pesticides.
[3:26:29.440 --> 3:26:33.440]  And the second year, they don't have the money to pay back,
[3:26:33.440 --> 3:26:36.440]  nor do they have the money for the new crop seeds
[3:26:36.440 --> 3:26:38.440]  because GMO seeds can't be saved,
[3:26:38.440 --> 3:26:40.440]  as General Stubblebine was saying,
[3:26:40.440 --> 3:26:43.440]  and as you've said so many times on your program.
[3:26:43.440 --> 3:26:45.440]  And now we have farmers who are destitute
[3:26:45.440 --> 3:26:48.440]  and Montanto quite happily kicks them off the land.
[3:26:48.440 --> 3:26:51.440]  They migrate to the cities where their families
[3:26:51.440 --> 3:26:53.440]  have no hope whatsoever.
[3:26:53.440 --> 3:26:56.440]  And if you've never seen abject poverty in Africa,
[3:26:56.440 --> 3:27:00.440]  specifically Ethiopia, Kenya, South Africa,
[3:27:00.440 --> 3:27:04.440]  if you've never seen India, you have no concept what that means.
[3:27:04.440 --> 3:27:06.440]  You're talking cities of 50 million, 20 million people,
[3:27:06.440 --> 3:27:09.440]  dead bodies laying around, human feces everywhere,
[3:27:09.440 --> 3:27:11.440]  hundreds of thousands of starving children.
[3:27:11.440 --> 3:27:14.440]  It's unbelievable.
[3:27:14.440 --> 3:27:17.440]  Let me say, Alex, that I will live for the rest of my days
[3:27:17.440 --> 3:27:20.440]  with an image of a starving Ethiopian woman
[3:27:20.440 --> 3:27:23.440]  making the international sign for feed meat,
[3:27:23.440 --> 3:27:26.440]  bringing her fingers to her lips,
[3:27:26.440 --> 3:27:30.440]  staring at me with absolutely dead, hopeless eyes.
[3:27:30.440 --> 3:27:33.440]  I will live with that graven in my consciousness
[3:27:33.440 --> 3:27:35.440]  for the rest of my life.
[3:27:35.440 --> 3:27:37.440]  That is unnecessary, and it's being brought about
[3:27:37.440 --> 3:27:40.440]  by globalization for the purposes of the globalizers
[3:27:40.440 --> 3:27:42.440]  who are fundamental.
[3:27:42.440 --> 3:27:45.440]  I've seen the documents on this in studies.
[3:27:45.440 --> 3:27:48.440]  Montanto and others will lose money.
[3:27:48.440 --> 3:27:50.440]  And they said back in 1999, the director,
[3:27:50.440 --> 3:27:52.440]  they said, we are trying to contaminate everything.
[3:27:52.440 --> 3:27:54.440]  We are trying to take over.
[3:27:54.440 --> 3:27:56.440]  And then the world will soon be contaminated with our GMO.
[3:27:56.440 --> 3:27:59.440]  We have the patent, and then we rule Earth.
[3:27:59.440 --> 3:28:02.440]  And so this is meant to just devastate.
[3:28:02.440 --> 3:28:05.440]  This is eugenics. Go ahead.
[3:28:05.440 --> 3:28:08.440]  So the food supply is devastated.
[3:28:08.440 --> 3:28:11.440]  The cotton supply, the cotton won't grow.
[3:28:11.440 --> 3:28:14.440]  The farmers are pushed off their land.
[3:28:14.440 --> 3:28:16.440]  Montanto gets the land.
[3:28:16.440 --> 3:28:23.440]  And now we have 128,000 heads of families dying primarily
[3:28:23.440 --> 3:28:26.440]  by drinking a half a cup of the very pesticide
[3:28:26.440 --> 3:28:28.440]  that has bankrupted them.
[3:28:28.440 --> 3:28:32.440]  We are talking about people, the face of humanity,
[3:28:32.440 --> 3:28:37.440]  being altered by this technology for its own purposes.
[3:28:37.440 --> 3:28:41.440]  It is not necessary to eat this food.
[3:28:41.440 --> 3:28:45.440]  It is not necessary to wear these products.
[3:28:45.440 --> 3:28:49.440]  And for wicked, yuppies, self-centered people,
[3:28:49.440 --> 3:28:50.440]  you're not escaping it.
[3:28:50.440 --> 3:28:51.440]  I hear them laugh.
[3:28:51.440 --> 3:28:53.440]  Get rid of them. They're black. They're Indian.
[3:28:53.440 --> 3:28:55.440]  You are not immune.
[3:28:55.440 --> 3:28:58.440]  This is all being done to you as a soft-kill weapon.
[3:28:58.440 --> 3:29:00.440]  It's just being done slower.
[3:29:00.440 --> 3:29:03.440]  They haven't turned the ambient background up as high.
[3:29:03.440 --> 3:29:06.440]  But farms and ranches, most of them are being lost.
[3:29:06.440 --> 3:29:08.440]  Most are gone.
[3:29:08.440 --> 3:29:10.440]  Our society is now being imploded.
[3:29:10.440 --> 3:29:14.440]  So now we, for being passive and not being involved
[3:29:14.440 --> 3:29:16.440]  and not fighting back like General Stubblebine was saying,
[3:29:16.440 --> 3:29:18.440]  we are now sowed the wind.
[3:29:18.440 --> 3:29:20.440]  We're going to reap the whirlwind.
[3:29:20.440 --> 3:29:23.440]  And as we come back, finish up Dr. Lebo and General Stubblebine
[3:29:23.440 --> 3:29:27.440]  on what you're seeing in Central America with them forcing it in.
[3:29:27.440 --> 3:29:29.440]  Here we go.
[3:29:32.440 --> 3:29:33.440]  Back live.
[3:29:33.440 --> 3:29:35.440]  We've got 27 minutes left.
[3:29:35.440 --> 3:29:37.440]  We'll go to at least five-year calls.
[3:29:37.440 --> 3:29:41.440]  Sean Toby, Robert, Sherry, and Dan from Washington to Illinois.
[3:29:41.440 --> 3:29:44.440]  Maybe get a few foreign callers in there as well.
[3:29:49.440 --> 3:29:51.440]  All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[3:29:51.440 --> 3:29:53.440]  let's try to compartmentalize the info now
[3:29:53.440 --> 3:29:55.440]  and get it out as fast as possible.
[3:29:55.440 --> 3:29:58.440]  So I want to go to calls here in just a few minutes
[3:29:58.440 --> 3:30:01.440]  with both of our guests.
[3:30:01.440 --> 3:30:04.440]  Finishing up how they force the GMO into countries,
[3:30:04.440 --> 3:30:06.440]  how it devastates the people.
[3:30:06.440 --> 3:30:09.440]  Even where it's illegal, they run what I would call,
[3:30:09.440 --> 3:30:11.440]  what the news called, intelligence operations
[3:30:11.440 --> 3:30:15.440]  to go in and secretly plant this stuff in research facilities.
[3:30:15.440 --> 3:30:17.440]  Absolutely.
[3:30:17.440 --> 3:30:23.440]  I want to say that there is a famine predicted by very, very intelligent folks
[3:30:23.440 --> 3:30:26.440]  looking at what's happening to our food supply.
[3:30:26.440 --> 3:30:28.440]  I've posted an article on our health freedom blog
[3:30:28.440 --> 3:30:30.440]  called The Famine of 2009.
[3:30:30.440 --> 3:30:33.440]  If anybody in America thinks that we're not reaping that whirlwind,
[3:30:33.440 --> 3:30:36.440]  as you said, wait until their plates are empty
[3:30:36.440 --> 3:30:39.440]  and there are food riots, because that's where we're going,
[3:30:39.440 --> 3:30:42.440]  unless we start growing our own.
[3:30:42.440 --> 3:30:44.440]  And yes, Panama has been contaminated.
[3:30:44.440 --> 3:30:47.440]  Brazil, New Zealand was contaminated,
[3:30:47.440 --> 3:30:52.440]  even though it was a GMO-free zone by national decree
[3:30:52.440 --> 3:30:54.440]  or by national law.
[3:30:54.440 --> 3:30:58.440]  The U.S. shipped genetically modified corn and wheat
[3:30:58.440 --> 3:31:00.440]  to New Zealand for three years
[3:31:00.440 --> 3:31:03.440]  before they, quote, discovered the mistake, end, quote.
[3:31:03.440 --> 3:31:00.440]  And this is
[3:31:07.440 --> 3:31:11.440]  cows whose milk and meat delivers drugs.
[3:31:11.440 --> 3:31:17.440]  And they're now putting cross species, pigs, mixing them.
[3:31:17.440 --> 3:31:19.440]  I just saw this in the BBC a few weeks ago
[3:31:19.440 --> 3:31:21.440]  that have had human genetics added to them,
[3:31:21.440 --> 3:31:24.440]  so the body parts that can be used, vowels and things,
[3:31:24.440 --> 3:31:26.440]  won't be rejected.
[3:31:26.440 --> 3:31:29.440]  They're now saying it's safe for us to eat clone food,
[3:31:29.440 --> 3:31:58.440]  milk from clone cows, and to eat cows that are part human.
[3:31:58.440 --> 3:32:27.440]  These things, you can see them.
[3:32:27.440 --> 3:32:56.440]  These things, you can see them.
[3:32:56.440 --> 3:33:25.440]  You can see them.
[3:33:25.440 --> 3:33:54.440]  You can see them.
[3:33:54.440 --> 3:34:23.440]  You can see them.
[3:34:23.440 --> 3:34:52.440]  You can see them.
[3:34:52.440 --> 3:35:21.440]  You can see them.
[3:35:21.440 --> 3:35:50.440]  You can see them.
[3:35:50.440 --> 3:36:19.440]  You can see them.
[3:36:19.440 --> 3:36:48.440]  You can see them.
[3:36:48.440 --> 3:37:17.440]  You can see them.
[3:37:18.440 --> 3:37:47.440]  You can see them.
[3:37:47.440 --> 3:38:16.440]  You can see them.
[3:38:17.440 --> 3:38:46.440]  You can see them.
[3:38:46.440 --> 3:39:15.440]  You can see them.
[3:39:15.440 --> 3:39:42.440]  You can see them.
[3:39:42.440 --> 3:40:09.440]  You can see them.
[3:40:09.440 --> 3:40:37.440]  You can see them.
[3:40:37.440 --> 3:41:06.440]  You can see them.
[3:41:06.440 --> 3:41:08.440]  Thanks for taking my call.
[3:41:08.440 --> 3:41:12.440]  You kind of touched on, I was going to ask about the chemtrails.
[3:41:12.440 --> 3:41:15.440]  I live here in Indiana, Indianapolis.
[3:41:15.440 --> 3:41:17.440]  A day doesn't go by that.
[3:41:17.440 --> 3:41:21.440]  I don't see dozens and dozens of chemtrails crisscrossing.
[3:41:21.440 --> 3:41:27.440]  Do you know if those are military airplanes or commercial airplanes?
[3:41:27.440 --> 3:41:30.440]  Some of them are all in the above.
[3:41:30.440 --> 3:41:32.440]  They add a lot of it to the fuel.
[3:41:32.440 --> 3:41:37.440]  You've got three major wholesalers of it, so it's added there.
[3:41:37.440 --> 3:41:39.440]  But it's not in all aircraft.
[3:41:39.440 --> 3:41:43.440]  I was thinking about trying to grow some of my own food,
[3:41:43.440 --> 3:41:46.440]  but with that stuff being sprayed in the skies,
[3:41:46.440 --> 3:41:50.440]  it probably makes more sense to try to grow stuff indoors.
[3:41:50.440 --> 3:41:52.440]  Put it in the greenhouse.
[3:41:52.440 --> 3:41:59.440]  The intensive farming indoors to create a community greenhouse
[3:41:59.440 --> 3:42:03.440]  for your neighbors if you're not too far out in the country to have neighbors.
[3:42:03.440 --> 3:42:10.440]  Do not assume that just because the sun is shining, your food is safe.
[3:42:10.440 --> 3:42:18.440]  And if you live in a farming area, your food is contaminated with genetically modified material,
[3:42:18.440 --> 3:42:20.440]  whether you know it or not.
[3:42:20.440 --> 3:42:22.440]  It blows around.
[3:42:22.440 --> 3:42:29.440]  Let's explain. Even the organic crops are having the same species,
[3:42:29.440 --> 3:42:36.440]  but a different variety blow in, and then plants aren't like a person where you've got one dad, one mom.
[3:42:36.440 --> 3:42:41.440]  Doctor, you want to explain that briefly, that plants take on the genetics of even other species?
[3:42:41.440 --> 3:42:46.440]  I was about to talk about this when we got to the call.
[3:42:46.440 --> 3:42:54.440]  Even organic food is allowed in the United States to have 10% genetically modified contamination.
[3:42:54.440 --> 3:42:59.440]  In the rest of the world, it's either 0.9% or 1% depending on the country.
[3:42:59.440 --> 3:43:06.440]  So we're talking about one-tenth of the material that you eat when you're eating organic food being contaminated
[3:43:06.440 --> 3:43:09.440]  and still called organic.
[3:43:09.440 --> 3:43:13.440]  It is absolutely essential that you start growing your own food.
[3:43:13.440 --> 3:43:19.440]  Plants get contaminated not only by the same species as we used to think,
[3:43:19.440 --> 3:43:23.440]  but also by other species, the genetic material mixes.
[3:43:23.440 --> 3:43:28.440]  The results are absolutely not in your favor.
[3:43:28.440 --> 3:43:30.440]  All right, Toby, got to jump. Robert and Canada, go ahead.
[3:43:30.440 --> 3:43:32.440]  I'm trying to go quick to these calls here.
[3:43:32.440 --> 3:43:34.440]  Robert, go ahead. You're on the air with our guest.
[3:43:34.440 --> 3:43:36.440]  Yeah, I'm in Toronto.
[3:43:36.440 --> 3:43:39.440]  This is a molecular comment.
[3:43:39.440 --> 3:43:46.440]  Back in the 80s, and the doctor will understand this, I had an immune system collapse,
[3:43:46.440 --> 3:43:57.440]  and I was going to die according to my internal medicine of some sort of lymphoma.
[3:43:57.440 --> 3:44:01.440]  The Epstein bar and other viruses had activated, and it was going chronic.
[3:44:01.440 --> 3:44:06.440]  I contacted the Palo Alto Institute in California and talked with Pauling's people, Linus Pauling,
[3:44:06.440 --> 3:44:11.440]  who, by the way, had 480 honorary PhDs and two Nobel Prizes.
[3:44:11.440 --> 3:44:16.440]  Correspondingly, they put me on the cath cart, Dr. Cathcart in Philadelphia,
[3:44:16.440 --> 3:44:20.440]  and they said, if you take vitamin C at the appropriate doses three times a day,
[3:44:20.440 --> 3:44:23.440]  what will happen is you'll kill the virus.
[3:44:23.440 --> 3:44:29.440]  Their claim with any virus, any acute virus, will be killed by vitamin C if it's used properly.
[3:44:29.440 --> 3:44:34.440]  Now, that's what happened, and this is the issue now with the codex.
[3:44:34.440 --> 3:44:45.440]  I've been taking 25 grams of C for 20, 22, 23 years, and if they cut off the supply of C,
[3:44:45.440 --> 3:44:48.440]  I've been told by physicians I'm in deep trouble.
[3:44:48.440 --> 3:44:50.440]  I contacted them.
[3:44:50.440 --> 3:44:54.440]  This is for you. I've practiced orthomolecular medicine for many, many years,
[3:44:54.440 --> 3:44:58.440]  and what you say is right, although most people can't handle the GI tract,
[3:44:58.440 --> 3:45:01.440]  can't handle that dose of vitamin C.
[3:45:01.440 --> 3:45:04.440]  Mine won't handle that. No, it can only take one gram.
[3:45:04.440 --> 3:45:07.440]  I can take 20 or more.
[3:45:07.440 --> 3:45:10.440]  There's another product which we recommend.
[3:45:10.440 --> 3:45:15.440]  It's NanoSilver, and we, the Natural Solutions Foundation,
[3:45:15.440 --> 3:45:22.440]  recommend a particular source which you can find if you go to our website,
[3:45:22.440 --> 3:45:25.440]  healthfreedomusa.org.
[3:45:25.440 --> 3:45:31.440]  And NanoSilver will kill all pathogens against which it's been tested currently,
[3:45:31.440 --> 3:45:40.440]  635 of them, including the H5N1 virus, which we believe to have been westernized,
[3:45:40.440 --> 3:45:49.440]  and the HIV-supposed causal virus.
[3:45:49.440 --> 3:45:52.440]  We're talking about an immensely important, completely safe,
[3:45:52.440 --> 3:45:56.440]  and totally universally applicable.
[3:45:56.440 --> 3:45:59.440]  And that's why they're trying to restrict that right here in Texas.
[3:45:59.440 --> 3:46:02.440]  You see essentially my comment. Hello?
[3:46:02.440 --> 3:46:04.440]  Yeah, they're trying to kill you, sir.
[3:46:04.440 --> 3:46:09.440]  Yeah, essentially my comment is about the suppression of orthomolecular solutions.
[3:46:09.440 --> 3:46:11.440]  In my case, it worked.
[3:46:11.440 --> 3:46:16.440]  The doctor who in fact supported me in this particular endeavor
[3:46:16.440 --> 3:46:20.440]  was quite severely chastised.
[3:46:20.440 --> 3:46:25.440]  There were some quite interesting political things were happening 20 odd years ago.
[3:46:25.440 --> 3:46:27.440]  So I wanted just to put that in.
[3:46:27.440 --> 3:46:32.440]  I wanted to sort of show that because there's so much talk about, you know,
[3:46:32.440 --> 3:46:36.440]  the suppression of medical solutions, orthomolecular and alternative medical solutions,
[3:46:36.440 --> 3:46:39.440]  this is just one case, and I thought I'd tell you about it.
[3:46:39.440 --> 3:46:41.440]  But thanks for the information.
[3:46:41.440 --> 3:46:44.440]  Thank you. There is a war against natural medicine,
[3:46:44.440 --> 3:46:48.440]  but there's also war against the people who are bringing you natural medicine
[3:46:48.440 --> 3:46:52.440]  against physicians and non-physicians who are sharing this information
[3:46:52.440 --> 3:46:56.440]  and using these techniques, an absolute war against them.
[3:46:56.440 --> 3:46:59.440]  And the reason is because they work.
[3:46:59.440 --> 3:47:01.440]  They work just like they work for you.
[3:47:01.440 --> 3:47:04.440]  They work for me. They work for Dr. Arima.
[3:47:04.440 --> 3:47:06.440]  They work for people who use them,
[3:47:06.440 --> 3:47:11.440]  and they, the people who are in this genocidal approach,
[3:47:11.440 --> 3:47:16.440]  do not want something like that that works.
[3:47:16.440 --> 3:47:19.440]  They would much rather give you TMO.
[3:47:19.440 --> 3:47:21.440]  They'd much rather give you drugs.
[3:47:21.440 --> 3:47:23.440]  Stay there. Stay there. Stay there.
[3:47:23.440 --> 3:47:25.440]  Here we go. Final segment.
[3:47:25.440 --> 3:47:30.440]  We're on Internet only. I appreciate your call, Robert.
[3:47:30.440 --> 3:47:32.440]  I'm going to talk to Sherri and Dan just for Internet only,
[3:47:32.440 --> 3:47:35.440]  but that's tens of thousands live right now and hundreds of thousands
[3:47:35.440 --> 3:47:37.440]  within a day and millions within weeks.
[3:47:37.440 --> 3:47:39.440]  That's the exponential power of the web.
[3:47:39.440 --> 3:47:40.440]  That's why they're now moving.
[3:47:40.440 --> 3:47:43.440]  I've got to do a whole show on this to attack the web.
[3:47:43.440 --> 3:47:44.440]  They're openly announcing it.
[3:47:44.440 --> 3:47:46.440]  They're shutting it down all over the place.
[3:47:46.440 --> 3:47:49.440]  Definitely things are moving quicker than I had even thought.
[3:47:49.440 --> 3:47:51.440]  And I don't like that because I want more time to beat these people.
[3:47:51.440 --> 3:47:54.440]  But let's take a few final calls and we'll come back on live on air
[3:47:54.440 --> 3:47:56.440]  and say bye to our guest.
[3:47:56.440 --> 3:47:59.440]  And let's not wait a year before we have General Stubblebine
[3:47:59.440 --> 3:48:01.440]  and Dr. Labo back on the show.
[3:48:01.440 --> 3:48:05.440]  Let's go ahead and go to Sherri in Texas.
[3:48:05.440 --> 3:48:07.440]  You're on the air. Go ahead.
[3:48:07.440 --> 3:48:09.440]  Hi. Hi, Alex.
[3:48:09.440 --> 3:48:12.440]  I just had a question about you, Labo.
[3:48:12.440 --> 3:48:14.440]  Okay.
[3:48:14.440 --> 3:48:17.440]  About chemtrails and their effect on humans.
[3:48:17.440 --> 3:48:21.440]  I have a family member who has stage 3 breast cancer.
[3:48:21.440 --> 3:48:24.440]  And she believes in chemtrails finally.
[3:48:24.440 --> 3:48:27.440]  I finally got pictures of them, video of them, showed them
[3:48:27.440 --> 3:48:30.440]  that these are not contrails, mom.
[3:48:30.440 --> 3:48:32.440]  And she, oh, well, there you go.
[3:48:32.440 --> 3:48:37.440]  But she basically doesn't think that they're affecting anything
[3:48:37.440 --> 3:48:39.440]  and doesn't take any...
[3:48:39.440 --> 3:48:41.440]  She doesn't believe in them because she understands them.
[3:48:41.440 --> 3:48:43.440]  Well, let me just be clear.
[3:48:43.440 --> 3:48:45.440]  The chemtrail phenomenon, it's a cocktail.
[3:48:45.440 --> 3:48:48.440]  There's a bunch of different operations going on
[3:48:48.440 --> 3:48:50.440]  and it's highly classified.
[3:48:50.440 --> 3:48:54.440]  They're only admitting the weather modification portion of them.
[3:48:54.440 --> 3:48:57.440]  And so we don't know. We need more research.
[3:48:57.440 --> 3:49:01.440]  But I know this. Until 96, trails were up there.
[3:49:01.440 --> 3:49:03.440]  They formed at 30,000 feet or higher.
[3:49:03.440 --> 3:49:05.440]  They were there for 30 seconds a minute.
[3:49:05.440 --> 3:49:08.440]  Now they're there for two hours while I'm in the garden
[3:49:08.440 --> 3:49:11.440]  and then they start floating down.
[3:49:11.440 --> 3:49:14.440]  But go ahead, doctor.
[3:49:14.440 --> 3:49:17.440]  Well, what I was going to say is if you go to our...
[3:49:17.440 --> 3:49:24.440]  If you Google, Morgellans, M-O-R-G-E-L-L-O-N-S,
[3:49:24.440 --> 3:49:28.440]  G-E-L-L-O-N apostrophe S,
[3:49:28.440 --> 3:49:33.440]  Morgellans disease and natural solutions foundation.
[3:49:33.440 --> 3:49:36.440]  If you Google both of those, you will find an article
[3:49:36.440 --> 3:49:39.440]  that I have written about chemtrails
[3:49:39.440 --> 3:49:42.440]  and Morgellans disease with photographs,
[3:49:42.440 --> 3:49:44.440]  with electron photomicrographs.
[3:49:44.440 --> 3:49:46.440]  And there's also a forum,
[3:49:46.440 --> 3:49:50.440]  the natural solutions foundation sponsors and hosts forums
[3:49:50.440 --> 3:49:53.440]  where people can talk to each other about specific issues,
[3:49:53.440 --> 3:49:57.440]  whether it's vaccination or Morgellans disease or whatever.
[3:49:57.440 --> 3:50:00.440]  And if you join that, you will find other people
[3:50:00.440 --> 3:50:03.440]  who will be able to tell you about chemtrails.
[3:50:03.440 --> 3:50:05.440]  They're very, very dangerous.
[3:50:05.440 --> 3:50:08.440]  The fact that your mom doesn't believe in them is kind of irrelevant.
[3:50:08.440 --> 3:50:10.440]  Well, she believes she doesn't think they're bad.
[3:50:10.440 --> 3:50:12.440]  Right.
[3:50:12.440 --> 3:50:15.440]  Well, listen, we're out of time. Thank you so much, Sherry.
[3:50:15.440 --> 3:50:17.440]  I'm going to try to cram Dan in for the full audience.
[3:50:17.440 --> 3:50:21.440]  Look, the government is taking foster children
[3:50:21.440 --> 3:50:23.440]  and testing pesticides on them until they die.
[3:50:23.440 --> 3:50:25.440]  New York Daily News.
[3:50:25.440 --> 3:50:27.440]  Believe the people running things are evil.
[3:50:27.440 --> 3:50:29.440]  Here we go.
[3:50:29.440 --> 3:50:39.440]  All right, real fast, because I've got to let my guests go,
[3:50:39.440 --> 3:50:42.440]  and I appreciate them joining us today.
[3:50:42.440 --> 3:50:43.440]  Have to have them back very soon.
[3:50:43.440 --> 3:50:47.440]  Dan in Illinois, final caller for General Stubblebind,
[3:50:47.440 --> 3:50:49.440]  Major General Stubblebind, and Dr. Lebo.
[3:50:49.440 --> 3:50:50.440]  Go ahead.
[3:50:50.440 --> 3:50:53.440]  Hey, Alex, I respect your show. Thanks for taking my call.
[3:50:53.440 --> 3:50:55.440]  Really quickly, I want to say my stepfather.
[3:50:55.440 --> 3:50:58.440]  I live here in Illinois, and he works in the agriculture business,
[3:50:58.440 --> 3:51:01.440]  and he does a lot of work with chemicals and fields.
[3:51:01.440 --> 3:51:06.440]  That's how he's supported my mother and all of us when I was a kid,
[3:51:06.440 --> 3:51:08.440]  and recently I talked to him.
[3:51:08.440 --> 3:51:10.440]  We don't have much of a relationship,
[3:51:10.440 --> 3:51:11.440]  and we were in the bar the other night,
[3:51:11.440 --> 3:51:14.440]  and he mentioned to me that he works under Monsanto.
[3:51:14.440 --> 3:51:18.440]  Now, I know a little bit about Monsanto and part of its agenda,
[3:51:18.440 --> 3:51:21.440]  and the thing is, I want to bring it up to him,
[3:51:21.440 --> 3:51:22.440]  and I want to talk to him about it,
[3:51:22.440 --> 3:51:23.440]  but I don't want to hurt his pride,
[3:51:23.440 --> 3:51:26.440]  because that's the job and the industry that he's in,
[3:51:26.440 --> 3:51:28.440]  and maybe what's the best way that I could go about?
[3:51:28.440 --> 3:51:31.440]  I want to give him studies about how it's sterilizing rats
[3:51:31.440 --> 3:51:34.440]  and say that studies show that they're the same thing to humans.
[3:51:34.440 --> 3:51:37.440]  I mean, do you want to be involved in something that's hurting people?
[3:51:37.440 --> 3:51:39.440]  Because he's compartmentalized,
[3:51:39.440 --> 3:51:42.440]  and I would send him to infowars.com.
[3:51:42.440 --> 3:51:47.440]  I would send him to the website of our guest today.
[3:51:47.440 --> 3:51:51.440]  I mean, there's a lot of things that you can do like that.
[3:51:51.440 --> 3:51:53.440]  Can I add something real quick?
[3:51:53.440 --> 3:51:54.440]  Yeah, go ahead.
[3:51:54.440 --> 3:51:57.440]  I would suggest you tell him that you were listening to the show,
[3:51:57.440 --> 3:52:02.440]  and you heard General Stubblebine, a man with a career of great luster,
[3:52:02.440 --> 3:52:09.440]  who realized that the forces that he was serving throughout his career
[3:52:09.440 --> 3:52:12.440]  were not what he understood them to be,
[3:52:12.440 --> 3:52:15.440]  and he had the courage to say,
[3:52:15.440 --> 3:52:19.440]  I did what I did with a heart of purity,
[3:52:19.440 --> 3:52:21.440]  but the people I was working for lied to me,
[3:52:21.440 --> 3:52:25.440]  and now I need to spread the information about what's real.
[3:52:25.440 --> 3:52:26.440]  Your dad can do the same.
[3:52:26.440 --> 3:52:29.440]  Absolutely, and I'm sorry to say to Dan,
[3:52:29.440 --> 3:52:32.440]  I'm sorry to say to Dan and Dr. Lebo and General Stubblebine
[3:52:32.440 --> 3:52:34.440]  that we are just flat out of time,
[3:52:34.440 --> 3:52:37.440]  but I want to thank you both for spending time with us today,
[3:52:37.440 --> 3:52:40.440]  and I want everybody to visit the website HealthFreedomUSA.org,
[3:52:40.440 --> 3:52:42.440]  and we'll also put it up on the screen.
[3:52:42.440 --> 3:52:45.440]  Absolutely, General Stubblebine was compartmentalized,
[3:52:45.440 --> 3:52:48.440]  I was compartmentalized, we all are in life,
[3:52:48.440 --> 3:52:51.440]  and the claims we're making are very serious,
[3:52:51.440 --> 3:52:52.440]  you better check them out, folks.
[3:52:52.440 --> 3:52:55.440]  General Stubblebine, Dr. Lebo, thank you for joining us.
[3:52:55.440 --> 3:52:58.440]  Thank you very, very much.
[3:52:58.440 --> 3:53:00.440]  Thank you, sir, thank you.
[3:53:00.440 --> 3:53:01.440]  Keep up the good work.
[3:53:01.440 --> 3:53:04.440]  I'll try, sir, God bless you, and God bless you too, Dr. Lebo.
[3:53:04.440 --> 3:53:05.440]  You guys take care.
[3:53:05.440 --> 3:53:07.440]  Thank you, Alex.
[3:53:07.440 --> 3:53:09.440]  Talk to you soon.
[3:53:09.440 --> 3:53:11.440]  We're out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:53:11.440 --> 3:53:13.440]  In the last few minutes of the show here,
[3:53:13.440 --> 3:53:16.440]  we also need support at infowars.com,
[3:53:16.440 --> 3:53:18.440]  and I hope you give the gift of information this holiday season,
[3:53:18.440 --> 3:53:21.440]  so check out the video on Bookstore there at infowars.com
[3:53:21.440 --> 3:53:24.440]  or get a prisonplanet.tv membership.
[3:53:24.440 --> 3:53:26.440]  Some of the sponsors that tie into all of this
[3:53:26.440 --> 3:53:29.440]  are eFoodsDirect, eFoodsDirect.com,
[3:53:29.440 --> 3:53:31.440]  the best horrible foods company out there,
[3:53:31.440 --> 3:53:34.440]  at the best price that I have personally found,
[3:53:34.440 --> 3:53:36.440]  high quality, non-GMO,
[3:53:36.440 --> 3:53:38.440]  800-409-5633,
[3:53:38.440 --> 3:53:40.440]  the most inexpensive, the highest quality,
[3:53:40.440 --> 3:53:43.440]  800-409-5633,
[3:53:43.440 --> 3:53:45.440]  you can see them up on screen at prisonplanet.tv,
[3:53:45.440 --> 3:53:47.440]  their website,
[3:53:47.440 --> 3:53:49.440]  the letter eFoodsDirect.com,
[3:53:49.440 --> 3:53:51.440]  eFoodsDirect.com,
[3:53:51.440 --> 3:53:54.440]  or 1-800-409-5633.
[3:53:54.440 --> 3:53:55.440]  Don't wait.
[3:53:55.440 --> 3:53:56.440]  Calling is horrible food today.
[3:53:56.440 --> 3:53:58.440]  Maybe everything's going to be fine.
[3:53:58.440 --> 3:54:00.440]  We always have hope, but it doesn't look like it.
[3:54:00.440 --> 3:54:02.440]  You need to have horrible food.
[3:54:02.440 --> 3:54:04.440]  You need to set yourself straight on the path of getting ready.
[3:54:04.440 --> 3:54:05.440]  eFoodsDirect.com.
[3:54:05.440 --> 3:54:07.440]  And then I can't say enough about Acola Blue,
[3:54:07.440 --> 3:54:10.440]  and this company's really amazed at the listeners,
[3:54:10.440 --> 3:54:12.440]  but it's a great product.
[3:54:12.440 --> 3:54:14.440]  Why wouldn't they be amazed that masses of people
[3:54:14.440 --> 3:54:16.440]  are calling and getting it?
[3:54:16.440 --> 3:54:18.440]  It's a atmospheric water generator for the home.
[3:54:18.440 --> 3:54:20.440]  Pays for itself in one year if you buy your water from the store.
[3:54:20.440 --> 3:54:22.440]  Great tasting, pure H2O,
[3:54:22.440 --> 3:54:24.440]  exactly the way nature makes it.
[3:54:24.440 --> 3:54:26.440]  No chemicals, pollutants, or toxins.
[3:54:26.440 --> 3:54:28.440]  Neutral pH, then goes through five filters inside,
[3:54:28.440 --> 3:54:31.440]  866-585-4044,
[3:54:31.440 --> 3:54:33.440]  866-585-4044.
[3:54:33.440 --> 3:54:35.440]  Calling, get a brochure,
[3:54:35.440 --> 3:54:37.440]  go to the website, check out all their products.
[3:54:37.440 --> 3:54:39.440]  They've got a bunch of other stuff.
[3:54:39.440 --> 3:54:41.440]  AcolaBlue.com grabs the water out of the air,
[3:54:41.440 --> 3:54:43.440]  they post it through five filters,
[3:54:43.440 --> 3:54:47.440]  and it is just awesome, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:54:47.440 --> 3:54:49.440]  These things are awesome.
[3:54:49.440 --> 3:54:51.440]  866-585-4044,
[3:54:51.440 --> 3:54:52.440]  or acolablue.com.
[3:54:52.440 --> 3:54:53.440]  All right, we are out of time.
[3:54:53.440 --> 3:54:55.440]  We broadcast with all the important guests
[3:54:55.440 --> 3:54:57.440]  we had on today.
[3:54:57.440 --> 3:54:59.440]  Starts right now at infowars.com
[3:54:59.440 --> 3:55:01.440]  with Bob Chapman and others.
[3:55:01.440 --> 3:55:02.440]  So be sure and stay with us.
[3:55:02.440 --> 3:55:14.440]  We've got a JAG officer on right now.
