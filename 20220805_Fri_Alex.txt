[00:15.000 --> 00:18.000]  Infowars. Tomorrow's news. Today.
[00:18.000 --> 00:36.000]  It's Friday, August 5th, 2022. I'm Alex Jones live at studio strap yourselves in.
[00:36.000 --> 00:48.000]  One of the things you've been talking about on your show is your allegation that
[00:48.000 --> 00:54.000]  government officials are aiding in a period of child trafficking and the
[00:54.000 --> 01:14.000]  grouping of children, right?
[01:14.000 --> 01:34.000]  What do you mean like what Jeffrey Epstein did with the cleanse?
[01:34.000 --> 01:40.000]  Love the great meme makers out there defending freedom. Great job. Love you all.
[01:40.000 --> 01:45.000]  Okay, we have the official announcements happening everywhere of shutting off the
[01:45.000 --> 01:51.000]  economy and that cannibalism will now be good. New York Times, Washington Post,
[01:51.000 --> 01:56.000]  Der Spiegel, all of it. They are officially saying, what I told you two years ago,
[01:56.000 --> 02:01.000]  they would start saying, the cannibalism is good. First they tell you to eat bugs,
[02:01.000 --> 02:05.000]  you'll own nothing and have nothing and like it, then eat humans and you ask,
[02:05.000 --> 02:08.000]  why are they doing this? Well, I've read the globalist battle plan.
[02:08.000 --> 02:13.000]  They want total dehumanization in the short documentary film that was just an
[02:13.000 --> 02:18.000]  add-on to in game blueprint for global enslavement in game 1.5.
[02:18.000 --> 02:22.000]  Finally found it. It had been on YouTube, it got deleted, but we finally found a copy
[02:22.000 --> 02:26.000]  of it last week and put it on Band-Aid video. In in game 1.5, we show you the
[02:26.000 --> 02:32.000]  UN documents from the UN that are only available at the library and in that film,
[02:32.000 --> 02:38.000]  Dr. Kaufman got it from the UN library in New York with special permission.
[02:38.000 --> 02:43.000]  He's an academic or was, he's dead now and they said, we're going to get rid of the
[02:43.000 --> 02:47.000]  value of human life, we're going to get rid of beautiful architecture and we're
[02:47.000 --> 02:52.000]  going to bring back human sacrifice and gladiatorial games and even cannibalism.
[02:52.000 --> 02:57.000]  Now you read that, that's the official UN plan, you're like, that sounds crazy.
[02:57.000 --> 03:03.000]  That's from the mid-1960s. Well, baby, we're here. Kill babies after they're born?
[03:03.000 --> 03:08.000]  You bet. We're going to hit that, we're going to hit the huge developments with
[03:08.000 --> 03:12.000]  DeSantis leading the charge, firing and then having the police go to the offices
[03:12.000 --> 03:18.000]  of Soros operatives inside the government so they can't destroy any evidence of
[03:18.000 --> 03:23.000]  them criminally taking orders from the big guy. We've got massive news on the
[03:23.000 --> 03:27.000]  China and Ukraine situation, big developments in Ukraine that nobody's
[03:27.000 --> 03:32.000]  talking about in the West, huge COVID-19 shots, killing people, major academic
[03:32.000 --> 03:36.000]  journals confirming it's causing mass death, which we already knew but this is
[03:36.000 --> 03:40.000]  just more confirmation. We've got a huge broadcast lined up for you today and then
[03:40.000 --> 03:45.000]  Mike Adams in studio, always amazing coming up at the second hour and he's going
[03:45.000 --> 03:50.000]  to also have some big guests on with him because I've got to go back down to this
[03:50.000 --> 03:56.000]  kangaroo court, the rest of it, I'll be here for about an hour and 15 minutes and
[03:56.000 --> 04:00.000]  I'll be back this evening as I did last night shooting special reports and going
[04:00.000 --> 04:04.000]  on the war room with Owen Schreuer, 3 to 6 p.m. I should be in there during the last
[04:04.000 --> 04:15.000]  hour today. I'll host you with Owen. All this news is huge. It's all massive but
[04:15.000 --> 04:25.000]  the discoveries we've made in how this attempt to rig the judiciary system in
[04:25.000 --> 04:35.000]  this country, what we've witnessed is next level, absolutely next level and it's
[04:35.000 --> 04:42.000]  a beta test being run by Soros, literally, to do this all over the country and
[04:42.000 --> 04:46.000]  you're not going to believe what the judge is doing publicly. She's not even hiding
[04:46.000 --> 04:52.000]  it and I believe it's criminal. I believe it's criminal but again this county is
[04:52.000 --> 04:55.000]  run by Soros so they're allowed to commit crimes. We can't even be good people.
[04:55.000 --> 04:57.000]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[05:01.000 --> 05:05.000]  The great reset in the war for the world is the book that the government doesn't
[05:05.000 --> 05:10.000]  want you to read that most of the big powerful companies trying to control your
[05:10.000 --> 05:14.000]  life, the big tech companies, they don't want you to read this book. They want to
[05:14.000 --> 05:19.000]  control what you think, what you do, what you read but you don't want that and
[05:19.000 --> 05:23.000]  Alex Jones doesn't want that and this book shows you what's happening and gives
[05:23.000 --> 05:28.000]  you the sort of playbook for how to fight against it and so by buying this book
[05:28.000 --> 05:32.000]  you're going to prove that censorship doesn't work, that freedom is alive in
[05:32.000 --> 05:37.000]  this country. This is a central reading and I would go right now and buy it
[05:37.000 --> 05:41.000]  before the censorship kicks in. It's not going to be available in bookstores.
[05:41.000 --> 05:45.000]  It's not going to be available in libraries. They're going to try to take it down
[05:45.000 --> 05:49.000]  from every platform that they can but they're not going to be able to do it.
[05:49.000 --> 05:53.000]  Prove that censorship doesn't work. Buy the great reset. Thank you Alex Jones.
[05:53.000 --> 05:57.000]  I really appreciate you having me on and I appreciate you writing this book
[05:57.000 --> 06:08.000]  and getting the information out there.
[06:43.000 --> 06:47.000]  I am very honored and blessed to be here with you today.
[06:47.000 --> 06:51.000]  Okay, there's always millions of folks that tune in. We're very
[06:51.000 --> 06:55.000]  blessed to the weekly show and the weekend shows both on radio and TV
[06:55.000 --> 06:58.000]  and of course over the Internet and the places you can find it where it's not
[06:58.000 --> 07:02.000]  being censored like infowars.com and Band-Aw video.
[07:02.000 --> 07:06.000]  And we have a big broadcast with a bunch of in-studio guests and more that I will
[07:06.000 --> 07:10.000]  tell you about coming up the start of the next segment and then I'll get into
[07:10.000 --> 07:15.000]  the huge China slash Ukraine Russian news, the massive
[07:15.000 --> 07:20.000]  COVID-19 new lockdown news, the huge
[07:20.000 --> 07:25.000]  green new deal admission of the planetary shutdown plan
[07:25.000 --> 07:29.000]  and so much more. The great work DeSantis is doing
[07:29.000 --> 07:33.000]  literally firing these deep state Soros operatives that violate
[07:33.000 --> 07:37.000]  their oaths of office and having the state police go into their offices
[07:37.000 --> 07:40.000]  to make sure they don't destroy any evidence of what they've been up to.
[07:40.000 --> 07:44.000]  He's got them under investigation. DeSantis just gets better and better
[07:44.000 --> 07:49.000]  because he's actually going after the deep state. Trump never really did that
[07:49.000 --> 07:52.000]  but DeSantis is doing it. Trump fought the deep state. Trump did a lot of things
[07:52.000 --> 07:56.000]  executively but never actually took Soros on head on.
[07:56.000 --> 08:00.000]  So we've got a special guest, Pastor Rodney Howard Brown,
[08:00.000 --> 08:04.000]  popping in at the bottom of the hour. This prosecutor is the one that had him
[08:04.000 --> 08:08.000]  arrested. Now he's been fired by the governor.
[08:08.000 --> 08:12.000]  So Rodney Howard Brown is just going to pop in for a segment or so.
[08:12.000 --> 08:15.000]  Then Mike Adams is going to have a big special guest when he's in here co-hosting
[08:15.000 --> 08:19.000]  who's one of the experts on why is the West committing suicide?
[08:19.000 --> 08:22.000]  What are some examples of it and how do we turn it around?
[08:22.000 --> 08:25.000]  And why do the globalists want the West to commit suicide?
[08:25.000 --> 08:29.000]  So that's another big guest as well here today.
[08:29.000 --> 08:36.000]  But let me do this now because a lot of people are tuning in to the show
[08:36.000 --> 08:41.000]  wanting to get my response to the $4.1 million judgment by an Austin jury
[08:41.000 --> 08:47.000]  yesterday. I shot a video last night that's at man.video where I lay out
[08:47.000 --> 08:52.000]  about five minutes, my stance on it and where I stand.
[08:52.000 --> 08:55.000]  But I'll do that again for everybody that's tuned in live because I know a lot of
[08:55.000 --> 08:59.000]  you are tuning in. There are new viewers wanting to get my view.
[08:59.000 --> 09:02.000]  But there's last night's announcement breaking exclusive. Alex Jones responds
[09:02.000 --> 09:06.000]  to $4.2 million Sandy Hook verdict, $628,000 views.
[09:06.000 --> 09:10.000]  You want to go see it. It's a very important video.
[09:10.000 --> 09:15.000]  But let me just briefly chronicle what's been happening in the last week and a
[09:15.000 --> 09:21.000]  half, now almost two weeks as of today in this kangaroo court and how it's the
[09:21.000 --> 09:25.000]  model for the rest of the country and the world and then how George Soros and
[09:25.000 --> 09:29.000]  the operatives are literally coordinating and running this.
[09:29.000 --> 09:32.000]  The corporate media that's in the courtroom are all coordinating.
[09:32.000 --> 09:35.000]  The judge is coordinating with the media.
[09:35.000 --> 09:39.000]  The judge is altering the record of the trial in my view and I'll explain that
[09:39.000 --> 09:44.000]  in a moment. She didn't just say I'm guilty until the jury
[09:44.000 --> 09:49.000]  or the 20 times I'm guilty and that they had to find me guilty.
[09:49.000 --> 09:53.000]  You're not allowed to find him innocent. I found him guilty, she said.
[09:53.000 --> 10:01.000]  She barred us from being able to respond in the punitive damages
[10:01.000 --> 10:08.000]  phase to our net worth. Now we turned over to them an accurate net
[10:08.000 --> 10:12.000]  worth at machine defaulted us. I spent days up here with lawyers.
[10:12.000 --> 10:15.000]  They got all the numbers. Looked at my personal money.
[10:15.000 --> 10:21.000]  Everything gave them a complete list under court order.
[10:21.000 --> 10:26.000]  And I knew it was all rigged but I wanted to show the world this and then
[10:26.000 --> 10:30.000]  instead they barred us from argument or calling any witnesses.
[10:30.000 --> 10:37.000]  We can only cross examine their expert who literally is some dandruff covered
[10:37.000 --> 10:41.000]  guy that looks like he has a gray wig on who stumbles around.
[10:41.000 --> 10:43.000]  He has a name like Thurston Howell, the seventh or something.
[10:43.000 --> 10:46.000]  I'm not joking. He has like five names.
[10:46.000 --> 10:48.000]  Wilford's nibble snubble of the gibble pibble.
[10:48.000 --> 10:50.000]  I mean, I've got to find his name in the news.
[10:50.000 --> 10:52.000]  That guy's print off articles about it.
[10:52.000 --> 10:56.000]  He's been testifying a few hours. I was just down there for 30 minutes.
[10:56.000 --> 11:00.000]  And I knew what they were going to say because the press kept asking me
[11:00.000 --> 11:05.000]  the New York Times, CBS News would say, you got $61 million last year
[11:05.000 --> 11:08.000]  and you're worth $300 million.
[11:08.000 --> 11:11.000]  And you're worth that worth as $170 million.
[11:11.000 --> 11:15.000]  And I would just hear these and I'd say, no, I don't have a million dollars
[11:15.000 --> 11:17.000]  in my bank account.
[11:17.000 --> 11:21.000]  I don't have all this stuff you're talking about.
[11:21.000 --> 11:23.000]  But they would always say the same stuff.
[11:23.000 --> 11:26.000]  So here's the big news first off.
[11:26.000 --> 11:28.000]  And people are live tweeting this and I've talked to my lawyers.
[11:28.000 --> 11:30.000]  This is indeed what they're saying.
[11:30.000 --> 11:31.000]  Overhead shop, please.
[11:31.000 --> 11:33.000]  A little bit of an overhead shop for me. Thanks.
[11:33.000 --> 11:38.000]  It says they just claimed Alex Jones personally pulled $61 million
[11:38.000 --> 11:40.000]  out of free speech last year.
[11:40.000 --> 11:44.000]  That is a completely insane made up number.
[11:44.000 --> 11:52.000]  Argued personal net worth of AJ 70 to 140 million.
[11:52.000 --> 11:56.000]  My net worth is below $5 million if you count everything I've got.
[11:56.000 --> 11:59.000]  It's because we had an official statement that we gave them.
[11:59.000 --> 12:02.000]  We had an updated statement where I have even less money now.
[12:02.000 --> 12:07.000]  And yesterday the judge said, oh, no, he can't testify and no one can talk on your side.
[12:07.000 --> 12:11.000]  We're just going to have this guy up there who literally looked at me
[12:11.000 --> 12:13.000]  like he wanted to kill me because I'm sitting there right in front of him.
[12:13.000 --> 12:19.000]  He's on the bench and our table is right in front of the testimony bench.
[12:19.000 --> 12:24.000]  And he just looked at me with just total hate.
[12:24.000 --> 12:28.000]  There is big brushy eyebrows, big bushy eyebrows.
[12:28.000 --> 12:30.000]  And I said, I know what this is going to be.
[12:30.000 --> 12:31.000]  I've already heard all the numbers.
[12:31.000 --> 12:33.000]  They're going to say, I have 61 million last year.
[12:33.000 --> 12:34.000]  And they're going to say, I have all this money.
[12:34.000 --> 12:35.000]  I mean, why not?
[12:35.000 --> 12:36.000]  They're closing statements.
[12:36.000 --> 12:39.000]  Yesterday they said he makes $300 million a year.
[12:39.000 --> 12:40.000]  It just keeps growing.
[12:40.000 --> 12:43.000]  Our biggest year ever gross was $70 million.
[12:43.000 --> 12:44.000]  That's gross.
[12:44.000 --> 12:47.000]  You know, when you're selling $30 million worth of food,
[12:47.000 --> 12:49.000]  but you make 30% on it on average.
[12:49.000 --> 12:53.000]  And they had some other doctored up stuff saying we make 70% on food.
[12:53.000 --> 12:55.000]  I assure you that's not the case.
[12:55.000 --> 12:59.000]  Strike me down by 50,000 trillion bolts of lightning if it's not true.
[12:59.000 --> 13:02.000]  Just really weird stuff going on in this trial.
[13:02.000 --> 13:04.000]  But it's not bad to make money.
[13:04.000 --> 13:05.000]  I wish we had a lot more money.
[13:05.000 --> 13:09.000]  We could do a lot more and not be so desperately trying to cling and stay on air.
[13:09.000 --> 13:11.000]  So all that happened.
[13:11.000 --> 13:15.000]  But really the big takeaway here is not that.
[13:15.000 --> 13:21.000]  I was here yesterday running around the office trying to watch the verdict.
[13:21.000 --> 13:25.000]  And she was killing the stream every five minutes or so.
[13:25.000 --> 13:27.000]  Because she said she would live stream it.
[13:27.000 --> 13:31.000]  But we kicked their butt so bad even though we had our hands tied behind our backs
[13:31.000 --> 13:34.000]  that they should kill the stream during most of my testimony.
[13:34.000 --> 13:39.000]  So that law and crime can only put out edited clips of me
[13:39.000 --> 13:41.000]  where I go, oh, that's a Perry Mason moment.
[13:41.000 --> 13:42.000]  Except it's not.
[13:42.000 --> 13:45.000]  Those text messages all come from me on my phone.
[13:45.000 --> 13:48.000]  I gave it to all the lawyers as I testified.
[13:48.000 --> 13:51.000]  And now you have it proving I told you the damn truth.
[13:51.000 --> 13:53.000]  And you guys just act like you didn't have it.
[13:53.000 --> 13:58.000]  And they go, oh, we got his phone. We got his phone. Who's given to him?
[13:58.000 --> 14:02.000]  So the level of this is really comical.
[14:02.000 --> 14:08.000]  In fact, at this point, I'm just like, I mean, I'm living in a crazy town here.
[14:08.000 --> 14:12.000]  It's like at the end of Cross of Iron where everything's collapsing.
[14:12.000 --> 14:16.000]  Everything's burning and blowing up as the Russians enter Berlin.
[14:16.000 --> 14:17.000]  Everybody's just laughing.
[14:17.000 --> 14:19.000]  I'm not comparing myself with the Germans in World War II.
[14:19.000 --> 14:23.000]  They're just saying, there just gets to be a point where it's so insane.
[14:23.000 --> 14:24.000]  You're just laughing at it.
[14:24.000 --> 14:27.000]  Because they sit there with the corporate media and the judge and their lawyers
[14:27.000 --> 14:30.000]  just saying all this stuff like parents, that is it true?
[14:30.000 --> 14:32.000]  Like everything else they do.
[14:32.000 --> 14:34.000]  So here's what I believe is illegal.
[14:34.000 --> 14:37.000]  If the judge is going to let something be televised, televised it.
[14:37.000 --> 14:44.000]  Real courts that they do it have a pool camera or two cameras that aim
[14:44.000 --> 14:47.000]  at whoever's speaking and when the judge speaks.
[14:47.000 --> 14:51.000]  Instead, there's just dozens of cameras, but they're all pet media
[14:51.000 --> 14:54.000]  and they all are on the same script and all put the same clips out basically.
[14:54.000 --> 14:57.000]  And the judge sits there while she controls the YouTube stream
[14:57.000 --> 15:01.000]  turning it on and turning it off and turning it on and turning it off.
[15:01.000 --> 15:03.000]  She doesn't even know how to mute the stream.
[15:03.000 --> 15:04.000]  She just kills the stream.
[15:04.000 --> 15:06.000]  She's up there like a DJ running it.
[15:06.000 --> 15:10.000]  So either you're going to show people the trial or don't.
[15:10.000 --> 15:13.000]  But I think it's illegal to claim something's televised
[15:13.000 --> 15:16.000]  and then only let out certain parts of the trial.
[15:16.000 --> 15:17.000]  You don't like happens.
[15:17.000 --> 15:20.000]  You kill the stream and then turn it back on the other side speaking.
[15:20.000 --> 15:23.000]  And then Bankston, their main lawyer gets up the plaintiff's lawyer,
[15:23.000 --> 15:26.000]  the ambulance chaser and goes, listen, judge,
[15:26.000 --> 15:29.000]  I want you to not kill the stream during this part because I'm going to expose
[15:29.000 --> 15:32.000]  that law enforcement wants Jones's phone and, you know,
[15:32.000 --> 15:35.000]  he's going down and it's January 6th and all this stuff.
[15:35.000 --> 15:36.000]  And none of that's even true.
[15:36.000 --> 15:38.000]  She's like, okay, I'll keep it streaming.
[15:38.000 --> 15:41.000]  But when my lawyer talks, she turns it off.
[15:41.000 --> 15:45.000]  I mean, this is beyond any kangaroo, rig,
[15:45.000 --> 15:46.000]  court ever.
[15:46.000 --> 15:49.000]  And this woman is literally a blue-haired SJW.
[15:49.000 --> 15:51.000]  We have photos of her on her own Facebook.
[15:51.000 --> 15:52.000]  She thinks it's all completely normal.
[15:52.000 --> 15:53.000]  They just think it's complete.
[15:53.000 --> 15:56.000]  She doesn't even understand how ridiculous she looks.
[15:56.000 --> 15:58.000]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[16:00.000 --> 16:01.000]  He was the Alex Jones crazy.
[16:01.000 --> 16:02.000]  He's a conspiracy theory guy.
[16:02.000 --> 16:03.000]  He's a nutcase.
[16:03.000 --> 16:06.000]  He got these rants and all that.
[16:06.000 --> 16:09.000]  What they miss is that this guy's ahead of the curve
[16:09.000 --> 16:13.000]  on so many different topics of signal, not noise.
[16:13.000 --> 16:18.000]  If you look at the signal and you compare that to PBS and NPR
[16:18.000 --> 16:22.000]  and BBC and we'll do what Alex Jones put out there versus
[16:22.000 --> 16:25.000]  what your collective body has put out there.
[16:25.000 --> 16:27.000]  And if you're a sent in a human being and just watching it,
[16:27.000 --> 16:29.000]  you say, well, God, Alex Jones is ahead of this.
[16:29.000 --> 16:31.000]  Not only that, he kind of explained it.
[16:31.000 --> 16:34.000]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[16:34.000 --> 16:35.000]  That is very rare.
[16:35.000 --> 16:38.000]  You got to go back almost to the revolutionary generation
[16:38.000 --> 16:40.000]  and see that in this new book.
[16:40.000 --> 16:42.000]  I got to tell you when Tony Lyons first approached me,
[16:42.000 --> 16:43.000]  I read this thing.
[16:43.000 --> 16:44.000]  I go, this is it.
[16:44.000 --> 16:46.000]  This is no beetry.
[16:46.000 --> 16:47.000]  You're not going to be flipping pages.
[16:47.000 --> 16:48.000]  You're going to be having a pin out.
[16:48.000 --> 16:50.000]  You're going to be underlying stuff.
[16:50.000 --> 16:53.000]  The Great Reset by Alex Jones.

[17:12.000 --> 17:14.000]  your immune system for your libido.
[17:14.000 --> 17:16.000]  And look, the average sum of the shelves
[17:16.000 --> 17:18.000]  is five, six, seven percent for your humanoid.

[17:54.000 --> 17:59.000]  with Body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[17:59.000 --> 18:02.000]  We are now living in the void,
[18:02.000 --> 18:05.000]  sliding towards collapse in the strange space
[18:05.000 --> 18:08.000]  between what we've known and what's to come.
[18:08.000 --> 18:12.000]  And right now, the most important thing to remember is
[18:12.000 --> 18:14.000]  don't panic. Stay calm,
[18:14.000 --> 18:17.000]  because now is the time that we must get our bearings
[18:17.000 --> 18:21.000]  and steer the ship onto a safe sound course.
[18:21.000 --> 18:23.000]  There is nothing stopping we the people
[18:23.000 --> 18:25.000]  from making our own rules
[18:25.000 --> 18:27.000]  and building our own society.
[18:27.000 --> 18:30.000]  All we gotta do is survive the crash.
[18:30.000 --> 18:33.000]  And right now, we still have time to prepare.
[18:33.000 --> 18:37.000]  The world fiat currency system is racing towards zero.
[18:37.000 --> 18:40.000]  It's time to convert it into hard assets now,
[18:40.000 --> 18:43.000]  including food, water, and survival gear
[18:43.000 --> 18:46.000]  to keep us strong and at the ready.
[18:46.000 --> 18:50.000]  Go to preparedtoday.com for the essentials,

[18:53.000 --> 18:59.000]  power, and more at preparedtoday.com.
[18:59.000 --> 19:02.000]  Several years ago, I approached one of the top companies
[19:02.000 --> 19:05.000]  in the U.S. that supplies the highest quality
[19:05.000 --> 19:08.000]  signature-reducing Faraday cages, the Pentagon,
[19:08.000 --> 19:10.000]  and other U.S. government agencies.
[19:10.000 --> 19:13.000]  And now, they have produced specifically for us
[19:13.000 --> 19:18.000]  this Made in America onion line at a very affordable price.
[19:18.000 --> 19:21.000]  Whether it's small pouches that protect your cell phone,
[19:21.000 --> 19:24.000]  or big pouches that protect laptops and iPads,
[19:24.000 --> 19:27.000]  or big bags that promote whatever electronics
[19:27.000 --> 19:29.000]  you want to put in it, like desktop computers,
[19:29.000 --> 19:33.000]  it is all exclusively available at infowarstore.com
[19:33.000 --> 19:36.000]  under the Redux name.
[19:36.000 --> 19:39.000]  Redux is InfoWars, taking the highest quality products
[19:39.000 --> 19:42.000]  and bringing them directly to you at infowarstore.com.
[19:42.000 --> 19:45.000]  In this insane world, you are crazy
[19:45.000 --> 19:48.000]  if you don't protect your signature, your identity,
[19:48.000 --> 19:51.000]  from identity theft, hackers, criminals,
[19:51.000 --> 19:52.000]  corporations, governments.
[19:52.000 --> 19:55.000]  This is one of the hottest items out there today
[19:55.000 --> 19:59.000]  that's exclusively available at infowarstore.com
[20:01.000 --> 20:05.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[20:05.000 --> 20:27.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[20:27.000 --> 20:29.000]  All right, guys.
[20:29.000 --> 20:31.000]  I promised you I'm gonna go into World News
[20:31.000 --> 20:32.000]  for the rest of this broadcast,
[20:32.000 --> 20:35.000]  and we got so many special guests in studio,
[20:35.000 --> 20:36.000]  but I gotta finish up,
[20:36.000 --> 20:38.000]  because they just gave me transcripts and tweets
[20:38.000 --> 20:41.000]  of what's going on down at the kangaroo courthouse there
[20:41.000 --> 20:48.000]  where I'm being railroaded in the second phase of the damages.
[20:48.000 --> 20:50.000]  And again, it's all ridiculous
[20:50.000 --> 20:54.000]  because I'll tell you the secret of it here in just a moment.
[20:54.000 --> 20:57.000]  But I told you the guy had a name like Thurston Howell III,
[20:57.000 --> 20:59.000]  but they didn't say his two middle names.
[20:59.000 --> 21:00.000]  He said it on the stand,
[21:00.000 --> 21:02.000]  because I was there this morning.
[21:02.000 --> 21:05.000]  It's Bernard Pettygill.
[21:05.000 --> 21:06.000]  And he goes like,
[21:06.000 --> 21:11.000]  Bernard Sinwapilis Guvattimandius Pettygillis.
[21:11.000 --> 21:13.000]  I mean, I couldn't believe when he said his name.
[21:13.000 --> 21:16.000]  And so he's sitting there staring at me,
[21:16.000 --> 21:19.000]  and I knew I had to come to the show, at least some of it.
[21:19.000 --> 21:21.000]  And I said, I know what he's gonna say,
[21:21.000 --> 21:24.000]  and I left to be here, because I mean, we need to be on air.
[21:24.000 --> 21:25.000]  Their whole mission is to get us off air.
[21:25.000 --> 21:27.000]  They made a huge issue of that.
[21:27.000 --> 21:29.000]  We've now learned.
[21:29.000 --> 21:33.000]  But that's not the issue.
[21:33.000 --> 21:36.000]  They are saying that I perjured myself saying,
[21:36.000 --> 21:38.000]  yeah, I gave you my text messages.
[21:38.000 --> 21:39.000]  I gave it to my lawyers.
[21:39.000 --> 21:43.000]  Aha, we have your text messages from your lawyers.
[21:43.000 --> 21:45.000]  Yeah, a bunch of raw ones they gave you on accident,
[21:45.000 --> 21:47.000]  not just the ones that you were ordered to turn over
[21:47.000 --> 21:49.000]  with search terms.
[21:49.000 --> 21:50.000]  That's the only issue.
[21:50.000 --> 21:51.000]  It's not my whole phone.
[21:51.000 --> 21:53.000]  It's, again, from late 2019, 2020,
[21:53.000 --> 21:54.000]  and there's nothing there.
[21:54.000 --> 21:55.000]  We've looked at it.
[21:55.000 --> 21:57.000]  We haven't done anything wrong.
[21:57.000 --> 21:59.000]  There's headlines everywhere.
[21:59.000 --> 22:00.000]  He's going down perjury.
[22:00.000 --> 22:01.000]  It's incredible.
[22:01.000 --> 22:04.000]  They're up there saying, this man has $300 million a year.
[22:04.000 --> 22:06.000]  This man is worth $107 million.
[22:06.000 --> 22:10.000]  This man was paid $61 million last year.
[22:10.000 --> 22:13.000]  You know what that $61 million number is?
[22:13.000 --> 22:15.000]  Because they sued my dad that I'm partners with
[22:15.000 --> 22:19.000]  in the supplement company that we set up 10 years ago?
[22:19.000 --> 22:25.000]  $61 million is like four years,
[22:25.000 --> 22:29.000]  of what the supplements cost.
[22:29.000 --> 22:31.000]  You can see these are quality.
[22:31.000 --> 22:33.000]  We can buy stuff for 10% of what we buy.
[22:33.000 --> 22:35.000]  We buy the highest quality we can get.
[22:35.000 --> 22:40.000]  The $61 million is money paid by free speech systems
[22:40.000 --> 22:43.000]  into that company to get the product.
[22:43.000 --> 22:46.000]  And that's they're suing my poor dad,
[22:46.000 --> 22:48.000]  saying we want the $61 million.
[22:48.000 --> 22:50.000]  If this guy was a real economist,
[22:50.000 --> 22:53.000]  we already explained to him, it bought the damn product.
[22:53.000 --> 22:55.000]  But they keep saying, where's,
[22:55.000 --> 22:57.000]  they don't even say four years,
[22:57.000 --> 23:02.000]  which it says that's the number in four years.
[23:02.000 --> 23:07.000]  They say that it's what I paid myself last year
[23:07.000 --> 23:10.000]  when on the sheet it says four years.
[23:10.000 --> 23:11.000]  Where's the missing?
[23:11.000 --> 23:13.000]  So I've been there for a week and a half,
[23:13.000 --> 23:15.000]  and reporters rocked by and go, we're going to get you.
[23:15.000 --> 23:17.000]  We know you made $61 million last year.
[23:17.000 --> 23:20.000]  And I go, oh, yeah, all right.
[23:20.000 --> 23:24.000]  So again, these people are out of control.
[23:24.000 --> 23:28.000]  And the judge told all the news cameras,
[23:28.000 --> 23:33.000]  I've authorized all of you to be here.
[23:33.000 --> 23:35.000]  But no one else is allowed to film.
[23:35.000 --> 23:38.000]  And if you do, I'll have you arrested and stuff like that.
[23:38.000 --> 23:39.000]  She's on tape.
[23:39.000 --> 23:42.000]  And then whenever we speak, she cuts us off on YouTube
[23:42.000 --> 23:45.000]  and then lets them speak.
[23:45.000 --> 23:48.000]  So they can then have the news crews edit down
[23:48.000 --> 23:50.000]  and they're coordinating because they put out
[23:50.000 --> 23:53.000]  different camera shots, but down to the same sections.
[23:53.000 --> 23:55.000]  So somebody picks the time.
[23:55.000 --> 23:57.000]  They've got these directors back there talking to all the cameras
[23:57.000 --> 23:59.000]  and then they put out what they want.
[23:59.000 --> 24:00.000]  Here's an example.
[24:00.000 --> 24:01.000]  Everybody's telling me about it.
[24:01.000 --> 24:05.000]  On YouTube, you'll have 10 to one comments for me.
[24:05.000 --> 24:07.000]  And all of a sudden, they all get pushed down and deleted
[24:07.000 --> 24:09.000]  and a bunch of hateful comments get put to the top.
[24:09.000 --> 24:11.000]  It'll have like five upvotes.
[24:11.000 --> 24:15.000]  One with a thousand upvotes is removed or pushed to the bottom.
[24:15.000 --> 24:19.000]  So they are, this is a war game of how to control the media,
[24:19.000 --> 24:24.000]  how to control the court and how to coordinate this scam.
[24:24.000 --> 24:26.000]  And this is huge, ladies and gentlemen.
[24:26.000 --> 24:31.000]  So the judge is in live time manipulating what the world can see
[24:31.000 --> 24:33.000]  so they can edit it to make me look bad.
[24:33.000 --> 24:35.000]  So I'm asking all the listeners.
[24:35.000 --> 24:38.000]  They don't want you to look at the last week and a half of the trial.
[24:38.000 --> 24:40.000]  They don't want you, but there's copies all over the internet.
[24:40.000 --> 24:44.000]  People are now figuring out she's doing this without us even ever asking.
[24:44.000 --> 24:48.000]  And now everybody's going and finding it and going and finding
[24:48.000 --> 24:51.000]  what they weren't supposed to have.
[24:51.000 --> 24:54.000]  Because there were several other groups they're streaming
[24:54.000 --> 24:58.000]  that didn't completely coordinate, so copies are out there.
[24:58.000 --> 25:00.000]  And people are recording it while it's streamed now,
[25:00.000 --> 25:02.000]  but noticing they've gotten desperate.
[25:02.000 --> 25:08.000]  So now she's cutting it off up to three or four times every 10 minutes.
[25:08.000 --> 25:13.000]  And I guess she gets a signal because they're actually signaling each other.
[25:13.000 --> 25:15.000]  I mean, hell, their head lawyer gets up and says,
[25:15.000 --> 25:18.000]  now don't cut the feed for the next 10 minutes, okay?
[25:18.000 --> 25:19.000]  And then he goes up and says,
[25:19.000 --> 25:23.000]  Jones perjured himself, you know, the Justice Department, everything else.
[25:23.000 --> 25:26.000]  We got his whole phone, which they don't, all this stuff.
[25:26.000 --> 25:30.000]  And then it's like, okay, your honor, and she's like cuts the feed.
[25:30.000 --> 25:35.000]  This is total coordination.
[25:35.000 --> 25:40.000]  This is a judge totally weaponized and the model of what they want to do.
[25:40.000 --> 25:48.000]  But here is the example of how Bernard Pettygill would be portrayed in Hollywood.
[25:48.000 --> 25:51.000]  But a lot of these economists are exactly like this.
[25:51.000 --> 25:53.000]  They don't know their head from a hole in the ground here at us.
[25:53.000 --> 25:55.000]  I'd settle down, people.
[25:55.000 --> 26:03.000]  We've got a lot to cover and time is short.
[26:03.000 --> 26:08.000]  There are two kinds of people in business today, the quick and the dead.
[26:08.000 --> 26:12.000]  So rather than waste your time this semester with a lot of useless theories,
[26:12.000 --> 26:18.000]  we're going to jump right in with both feet and create a fictional company from the ground up.
[26:18.000 --> 26:21.000]  We'll construct our physical plant.
[26:21.000 --> 26:25.000]  We'll set up an efficient administrative and executive structure.
[26:25.000 --> 26:28.000]  Then we'll manufacture our product and market it.
[26:28.000 --> 26:31.000]  I think you'll find it very interesting and a lot of fun.
[26:31.000 --> 26:36.000]  So let's start by looking at construction costs of our new factory.
[26:36.000 --> 26:39.000]  What's the product?
[26:39.000 --> 26:42.000]  That is immaterial for the purposes of our discussion here.
[26:42.000 --> 26:46.000]  But if it makes you happy, let's say we're making tape recorders.
[26:46.000 --> 26:48.000]  Tape recorders? Are you kidding?
[26:48.000 --> 26:51.000]  The Japs will kill us on a labor course.
[26:51.000 --> 26:53.000]  Okay, fine.
[26:53.000 --> 26:57.000]  Then let's just say they're widgets.
[26:57.000 --> 26:59.000]  What's a widget?
[26:59.000 --> 27:02.000]  It's a fictional product. It doesn't matter.
[27:02.000 --> 27:06.000]  It doesn't matter. Tell that to the bank.
[27:06.000 --> 27:08.000]  Take it easy. It's the first thing.
[27:08.000 --> 27:13.000]  On the board, you will see a cost analysis for construction of a 30,000 square foot facility,
[27:13.000 --> 27:16.000]  which will encompass both factory and office space,
[27:16.000 --> 27:22.000]  and is fully serviced by all utilities, a railroad spur line, and a four bay shipping dock.
[27:22.000 --> 27:24.000]  Hold on. Hold on. Why Bill?
[27:24.000 --> 27:28.000]  You better off leasing it and bucking a quarter buck and a half a square foot.
[27:28.000 --> 27:32.000]  Don't pay that and put it into CDs, or something else you can roll over every couple of months.
[27:32.000 --> 27:34.000]  Thank you, Mr. Mellon.
[27:34.000 --> 27:39.000]  But we'll be concentrating on finance a little later in the term.
[27:39.000 --> 27:44.000]  For the time being, let's just concentrate on the construction figures, shall we?
[27:44.000 --> 27:49.000]  You will see the final bottom line requires the factoring in of not just the material and construction costs,
[27:49.000 --> 27:54.000]  but also the architect's fees and the costs of land servicing.
[27:54.000 --> 27:57.000]  Oh, you left out a bunch of stuff.
[27:57.000 --> 28:01.000]  Oh, really? Like what, for instance?
[28:01.000 --> 28:07.000]  Well, first of all, you're going to have to grease the local politicians for the sudden zoning problems that always come up.
[28:07.000 --> 28:09.000]  Then there's the kickbacks to the carpenters.
[28:09.000 --> 28:13.000]  And if you plan on using any cement in this building, I'm sure the team should like to have a little chat with you,
[28:13.000 --> 28:15.000]  and that'll cost you.
[28:15.000 --> 28:17.000]  Oh, and don't forget something for the building inspectors.
[28:17.000 --> 28:20.000]  Then there's a long-term cost, such as waste disposal.
[28:20.000 --> 28:25.000]  I don't know if you're familiar with who runs that business, but I assure you it's not the Boy Scouts.
[28:25.000 --> 28:27.000]  That'll be quite enough, Mr. Mellon.
[28:27.000 --> 28:32.000]  Maybe bribes and kickbacks and mafia payoffs are how you do business.
[28:32.000 --> 28:35.000]  But they are not part of the legitimate business world.
[28:35.000 --> 28:38.000]  And they're certainly not part of anything I am teaching in this class.
[28:38.000 --> 28:39.000]  Do I make myself clear?
[28:39.000 --> 28:42.000]  Sorry, just trying to help, that's all.
[28:42.000 --> 28:51.000]  Now, notwithstanding Mr. Mellon's input, the next question for us is where to build our factory.
[28:51.000 --> 28:53.000]  How about fantasy land?
[28:53.000 --> 28:56.000]  How about fantasy land?
[28:59.000 --> 29:01.000]  People say Alex Jones is crazy.
[29:01.000 --> 29:02.000]  He's a conspiracy theory guy.
[29:02.000 --> 29:03.000]  He's a nutcase.
[29:03.000 --> 29:05.000]  He's got these rants and all that.
[29:05.000 --> 29:13.000]  What they miss is that this guy's ahead of the curve on so many different topics of signal, not noise.
[29:13.000 --> 29:19.000]  If you look at the signal, and you compare that to PBS and NPR and BBC,
[29:19.000 --> 29:25.000]  and we'll do what Alex Jones put out there versus what your collective body has put out there.
[29:25.000 --> 29:29.000]  And if you're a sentient human being and just watching it, you say, well, Alex Jones is ahead of this.
[29:29.000 --> 29:31.000]  Not only that, he kind of explained it.
[29:31.000 --> 29:34.000]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[29:34.000 --> 29:35.000]  That is very rare.
[29:35.000 --> 29:39.000]  You've got to go back almost to the revolutionary generation and see that.
[29:39.000 --> 29:43.000]  In this new book, I've got to tell you, when Tony Lyons first approached me, I read this thing.
[29:43.000 --> 29:44.000]  I go, this is it.
[29:44.000 --> 29:46.000]  This is no beetry.
[29:46.000 --> 29:47.000]  You're not going to be flipping pages.
[29:47.000 --> 29:49.000]  You're going to be having a pin out.
[29:49.000 --> 29:50.000]  You're going to be underlying stuff.

[29:59.000 --> 30:01.000]  Info Wars has been vindicated.
[30:01.000 --> 30:02.000]  We've been proven right.
[30:02.000 --> 30:05.000]  World government, the New World Order is out of the open.
[30:05.000 --> 30:11.000]  And now more than ever, the forces of Satan are trying to shut down this broadcast.
[30:11.000 --> 30:15.000]  The forces of anti-human, godless New World Order are out of control.
[30:15.000 --> 30:19.000]  So now realize, we have pushed them out in the light.
[30:19.000 --> 30:20.000]  We have pushed them out in the open.
[30:20.000 --> 30:21.000]  And they are so upset.
[30:21.000 --> 30:22.000]  And they are so scared.
[30:22.000 --> 30:27.000]  So while you still can, because any day can be our last broadcast, spread the word about the show.

[31:56.000 --> 31:58.000]  Vitamin, mineral, fusion.
[31:58.000 --> 32:07.000]  We are now living in the void, sliding towards collapse in the strange space between what we've known and what's to come.
[32:07.000 --> 32:12.000]  And right now, the most important thing to remember is don't panic.
[32:12.000 --> 32:20.000]  Stay calm because now is the time that we must get our bearings and steer the ship onto a safe sound course.
[32:20.000 --> 32:27.000]  There is nothing stopping we the people from making our own rules and building our own society.
[32:27.000 --> 32:30.000]  All we got to do is survive the crash.
[32:30.000 --> 32:33.000]  And right now, we still have time to prepare.
[32:33.000 --> 32:37.000]  The world fiat currency system is racing towards zero.
[32:37.000 --> 32:46.000]  It's time to convert it into hard assets now, including food, water and survival gear to keep us strong and at the ready.
[32:46.000 --> 32:58.000]  To preparetoday.com for the essentials, storable foods, water filtration, first aid, power and more at preparetoday.com.
[33:27.000 --> 33:33.000]  Well, my favorite pastor, Rodney Howard Brown, is going to be our guest for the rest of the hour.
[33:33.000 --> 33:38.000]  He was one of the main leaders, the first major pastor and then thousands others followed.
[33:38.000 --> 33:46.000]  God is here but around the world refusing to be shut down during the first days of the lockdowns two and a half years ago.
[33:46.000 --> 33:53.000]  He was arrested by the Soros backed and controlled prosecutor and thrown in jail.
[33:53.000 --> 34:00.000]  But he still got right back out and kept his huge international church with tens of thousands of members just alone in the Tampa area.
[34:00.000 --> 34:06.000]  The largest church going, serving thousands of poor with food a day and so much more.
[34:06.000 --> 34:10.000]  And now the worm has turned big time.
[34:10.000 --> 34:16.000]  We'll be talking to him in a moment, but first, here's a little bit of DeSantis's announcement and a little bit of his visit to Tucker Carlson last night.
[34:16.000 --> 34:22.000]  The Constitution of Florida has vested the veto power in the governor, not in individual state attorneys.
[34:22.000 --> 34:31.000]  And so when you flagrantly violate your oath of office, when you make yourself above the law, you have violated your duty.
[34:31.000 --> 34:37.000]  You have neglected your duty and you are displaying a lack of competence to be able to reform those duties.
[34:37.000 --> 34:44.000]  And so today we are suspending state attorney Andrew Warren, effective in media.
[34:44.000 --> 34:58.000]  Well, Tucker, you documented the destruction that we've seen with these Soros prosecutors around the country where they basically take it upon themselves to determine which laws should be followed and which laws should not be followed.
[34:58.000 --> 35:08.000]  And I can tell you in Florida's Constitution, that Constitution vests the veto power in the governor, not an individual district attorney or state attorney where they can pick and choose.
[35:08.000 --> 35:12.000]  And so I asked my staff to review all state attorneys in the state of Florida.
[35:12.000 --> 35:15.000]  I wanted to see who was picking and choosing.
[35:15.000 --> 35:23.000]  And this is the guy that all the line prosecutors, all the law enforcement said he thinks he can pick and choose which laws.
[35:23.000 --> 35:32.000]  And he actually signed letters saying he wouldn't force laws against transgender surgeries for minors, laws protecting the right to life.
[35:32.000 --> 35:38.000]  And then he has all these policies in his agency that are called presumptive non-prosecution.
[35:38.000 --> 35:42.000]  No, the law is presumptively enforced. That's not something that's acceptable.
[35:42.000 --> 35:43.000]  Right.
[35:43.000 --> 35:45.000]  And so there today we made the decision.
[35:45.000 --> 35:49.000]  The jarring thing about it though, Tucker, I had all these sheriffs from the area there.
[35:49.000 --> 35:57.000]  I had the former police chief in Tampa. There's a lot of line prosecutors in that office that are very happy that this was done.
[35:57.000 --> 35:59.000]  And so we took it seriously.
[35:59.000 --> 36:03.000]  We did a thorough review and we pulled the trigger today.
[36:03.000 --> 36:05.000]  I mean, it's so obviously unconstitutional.
[36:05.000 --> 36:07.000]  Legislatures make the laws.
[36:07.000 --> 36:10.000]  Judges decide whether they're consistent with the Constitution.
[36:10.000 --> 36:11.000]  Prosecutors have no role in that.
[36:11.000 --> 36:16.000]  They don't have the legal right, the constitutional right to selectively enforce the law.
[36:16.000 --> 36:17.000]  Or am I missing something?
[36:17.000 --> 36:20.000]  No, you're right. But here's what Soros is doing.
[36:20.000 --> 36:22.000]  It's actually smart on his part.
[36:22.000 --> 36:27.000]  They can't get these things enacted in a legislature where you're just going to let criminal run.
[36:27.000 --> 36:32.000]  So what they do, he will get involved in these Democrat primaries in a Democrat area.
[36:32.000 --> 36:36.000]  He'll flush a million dollars to get the radical to win the primary.
[36:36.000 --> 36:40.000]  Then they usually win the general because of the party affiliation difference in the jurisdiction.
[36:40.000 --> 36:42.000]  So then you get them in there.
[36:42.000 --> 36:47.000]  And what they do is they want to change the criminal justice system through non enforcement.
[36:47.000 --> 36:51.000]  So it's a total end run around our constitutional system.
[36:51.000 --> 36:55.000]  The results obviously have been destructive around the country.
[36:55.000 --> 37:00.000]  But it also really undermines the idea that ours is supposed to be a government of laws,
[37:00.000 --> 37:02.000]  not a government of individual men.
[37:05.000 --> 37:08.000]  And they went on in the entire hour long special.
[37:08.000 --> 37:12.000]  They spent a lot of time on Pastor Rodney Howard Brown at revival.com.
[37:12.000 --> 37:14.000]  And now he was arrested.
[37:14.000 --> 37:15.000]  They were harassed.
[37:15.000 --> 37:17.000]  All sorts of other things happen.
[37:17.000 --> 37:18.000]  Simply amazing.
[37:18.000 --> 37:20.000]  And we've got him with us to talk about this.
[37:20.000 --> 37:26.000]  DeSantis sends cops to physically remove suspended Soros back state attorney.
[37:26.000 --> 37:32.000]  And they want to get into obviously the state on computers and see what directives he was getting from Soros.
[37:32.000 --> 37:37.000]  And warrants not needed because it's the governor and he's in command of that and in command of law enforcement.
[37:37.000 --> 37:40.000]  Instead, they think these prosecutors are the governors.
[37:40.000 --> 37:46.000]  So Rodney Howard Brown, congratulations on being steadfast and helping lead preachers worldwide to stand up to this.
[37:46.000 --> 37:47.000]  I wanted to get you on.
[37:47.000 --> 37:49.000]  I appreciate you coming on a short notice.
[37:49.000 --> 37:50.000]  God bless you.
[37:50.000 --> 37:52.000]  No, thank you, Alex.
[37:52.000 --> 37:59.000]  You know, there was no doubt in my mind that we were targeted by Soros because 22 years ago,
[37:59.000 --> 38:04.000]  I was in the big church in Budapest and that church had a revival.
[38:04.000 --> 38:07.000]  They're the ones that kicked Soros out of Hungary.
[38:07.000 --> 38:09.000]  So I've always been Andy Soros.
[38:09.000 --> 38:15.000]  I already knew what he was doing around the world, you know, as you've already talked about a lot on your program.
[38:15.000 --> 38:22.000]  And so I probably was not aware that the attorney that came after me, the district attorney, was actually a Soros operative.
[38:22.000 --> 38:24.000]  I didn't realize it.
[38:24.000 --> 38:31.000]  And I felt at the time when I got arrested and I was in prison and came out, they dropped all charges.
[38:31.000 --> 38:35.000]  Obviously, because the Constitution was with me and not with them.
[38:35.000 --> 38:41.000]  But I didn't, I felt not to sue and now look at what the Lord did.
[38:41.000 --> 38:42.000]  Everything turned around.
[38:42.000 --> 38:48.000]  And what's so crazy is the governor came right to the office where the warrant for my arrest was issued.
[38:48.000 --> 38:52.000]  And I actually should have been there yesterday, but we got in late from Fort Worth.
[38:52.000 --> 38:54.000]  We landed about 3.30 in the morning.
[38:54.000 --> 38:58.000]  And by the time I got to bed, I, you know, and then I also didn't want to go there.
[38:58.000 --> 39:01.000]  I actually didn't really know what the full meeting was about.
[39:01.000 --> 39:06.000]  I was invited to be there with the governor, but in retrospect, it would look like I was gloating or whatever.
[39:06.000 --> 39:14.000]  And I'm, you know, I'm just about what we have to do to keep America safe and the American people safe.
[39:14.000 --> 39:16.000]  Well, it really is amazing.
[39:16.000 --> 39:23.000]  And I think about Arthur Poloski, though, he spent months and months and months in prison for reopening his church.
[39:23.000 --> 39:32.000]  And he's finally out solitary confinement for what four months that we had peaceful folks with the that led the trucker protest.
[39:32.000 --> 39:35.000]  She was in jail more than four months without bail.
[39:35.000 --> 39:37.000]  I mean, this is dangerous.
[39:37.000 --> 39:38.000]  Yeah, no question.
[39:38.000 --> 39:41.000]  We also just had a pastor come down from Canada.
[39:41.000 --> 39:43.000]  He was 10 days in solitary confinement.
[39:43.000 --> 39:47.000]  And then he got out and he was actually confined to his house.
[39:47.000 --> 39:53.000]  But I told him, well, I mean, it could have been worse, but you with your wife and kids, you should be happy.
[39:53.000 --> 39:55.000]  You were not still in solitary.
[39:55.000 --> 39:58.000]  But I mean, this is the stuff that's going on around the world.
[39:58.000 --> 40:05.000]  And really, as I always said, this was an attack against the church because they know that the church is a meeting place,
[40:05.000 --> 40:11.000]  a place of fellowship, a place of community and a place if pastors really speak up,
[40:11.000 --> 40:20.000]  they actually have weight with the congregation and they wanted to silence all the preachers and really put a shot across the bow and make everybody be afraid.
[40:20.000 --> 40:26.000]  We better just comply, get everybody masked, get them all tested, get them back.
[40:26.000 --> 40:32.000]  And then you saw what happened where churches actually became vaccine centers where people came.
[40:32.000 --> 40:37.000]  So what I said to pastors is, OK, so let's think about this.
[40:37.000 --> 40:40.000]  We have to close the church down because of COVID.
[40:40.000 --> 40:46.000]  But now the same church that's closed because of COVID, we can now open to come and get a vaccine.
[40:46.000 --> 40:48.000]  That didn't make sense.
[40:48.000 --> 40:53.000]  So if you just reason it out, it's like pure insanity.
[40:53.000 --> 40:57.000]  And then you begin to realize it was not about 15 days to slow the spread.
[40:57.000 --> 41:06.000]  And now they come up with the monkeypox concoction, which I think is more donkeypox personally.
[41:06.000 --> 41:10.000]  And it's really whatever that narrative is, what they want to push.
[41:10.000 --> 41:21.000]  The Agenda 2030, which was Agenda 21, then Agenda 2030, and the whole bringing America into conformity.
[41:21.000 --> 41:26.000]  And I think last time I was on your program, we talked about it where they underestimated.
[41:26.000 --> 41:29.000]  They thought that America was one country and we're just bow.
[41:29.000 --> 41:33.000]  They didn't realize we actually 50 states and the states are sovereign.
[41:33.000 --> 41:39.000]  So unlike the UK or other nations where they actually have to obey, we don't.
[41:39.000 --> 41:40.000]  We have a constitution.
[41:40.000 --> 41:41.000]  Exactly.
[41:41.000 --> 41:44.000]  And Fauci last week said Americans are bad.
[41:44.000 --> 41:46.000]  They don't know how to obey authority.
[41:46.000 --> 41:47.000]  Well, he's not a real authority.
[41:47.000 --> 41:49.000]  Everything he says a lie.
[41:49.000 --> 41:51.000]  Plus he doesn't work.
[41:51.000 --> 41:59.000]  Listen, the guy is a puppet put there basically by the World Health Organization and the United Nations.
[41:59.000 --> 42:01.000]  He talks to them.
[42:01.000 --> 42:03.000]  They tell him what to do.
[42:03.000 --> 42:05.000]  And then he forces it on the American people.
[42:05.000 --> 42:08.000]  That guy should be arrested immediately.
[42:08.000 --> 42:13.000]  And for all of the stuff perpetrated on humanity, really war crimes.
[42:13.000 --> 42:14.000]  Totally.
[42:14.000 --> 42:16.000]  Sarah should be arrested right now.
[42:16.000 --> 42:17.000]  Fauci should be arrested.
[42:17.000 --> 42:18.000]  Bill Gates should be arrested.
[42:18.000 --> 42:24.000]  All these people that are complicit in wreaking havoc on our planet, but they're losing Alex.
[42:24.000 --> 42:25.000]  They are losing.
[42:25.000 --> 42:27.000]  It's coming unravel.
[42:27.000 --> 42:28.000]  It's coming.
[42:28.000 --> 42:29.000]  God bless you, Pastor.
[42:29.000 --> 42:32.000]  I want to do one more segment with you in your precious times.
[42:32.000 --> 42:34.000]  I know you work around the clock like we do.
[42:34.000 --> 42:35.000]  We love you.
[42:35.000 --> 42:37.000]  I want to come back and cover whatever topics you want.
[42:37.000 --> 42:39.000]  We haven't talked other than text messages this morning.
[42:39.000 --> 42:43.000]  I've got a lot of questions, but I want you to talk about whatever you think's most important right now.
[42:43.000 --> 42:45.000]  I'm worried about the new lockdowns they're announcing.
[42:45.000 --> 42:46.000]  The wars are trying to start.
[42:46.000 --> 42:47.000]  The collapsing borders.
[42:47.000 --> 42:48.000]  What's going to happen to Biden?
[42:48.000 --> 42:52.000]  But I want to hear what's front and center for Pastor Rodney Howard Brown.
[42:52.000 --> 42:53.000]  Straight ahead.
[42:53.000 --> 42:55.000]  Visit his site, revival.com.
[42:55.000 --> 43:00.000]  Everybody's church should be his church.
[43:00.000 --> 43:05.000]  The great reset in the war for the world is the book that the government doesn't want you to read,
[43:05.000 --> 43:11.000]  that most of the big, powerful companies trying to control your life, the big tech companies,
[43:11.000 --> 43:13.000]  they don't want you to read this book.
[43:13.000 --> 43:18.000]  They want to control what you think, what you do, what you read, but you don't want that.
[43:18.000 --> 43:20.000]  And Alex Jones doesn't want that.
[43:20.000 --> 43:25.000]  The book shows you what's happening and gives you the sort of playbook for how to fight against it.
[43:25.000 --> 43:31.000]  And so by buying this book, you're going to prove that censorship doesn't work, that freedom is alive in this country.
[43:31.000 --> 43:33.000]  This is a central reading.
[43:33.000 --> 43:38.000]  And, you know, I would go right now and buy it before the censorship kicks in.
[43:38.000 --> 43:40.000]  It's not going to be available in bookstores.
[43:40.000 --> 43:43.000]  It's not going to be available in libraries.
[43:43.000 --> 43:48.000]  They're going to try to take it down from every platform that they can, but they're not going to be able to do it.
[43:48.000 --> 43:50.000]  Prove that censorship doesn't work.
[43:50.000 --> 43:52.000]  Buy the great reset. Thank you, Alex Jones.
[43:52.000 --> 44:21.000]  I really appreciate you having me on and I appreciate you writing this book and getting the animation out there.

[47:02.000 --> 47:15.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:15.000 --> 47:19.000]  We are back with Rodney Howard Brown who's traveled to more than a hundred countries.
[47:19.000 --> 47:25.000]  He's been in America for decades but witnessed the incredible upheaval in South Africa.
[47:25.000 --> 47:27.000]  Revival.com, he's here with us.
[47:27.000 --> 47:36.000]  He was the pastor arrested by the Soros State Attorney who's now been fired for violating his Oakville office and dereliction of duty.
[47:36.000 --> 47:39.000]  And being the agent of Soros, Governor DeSantis did a great job there.
[47:39.000 --> 47:41.000]  But so much to talk about.
[47:41.000 --> 47:44.000]  What is front and center for you, Pastor Brown?
[47:44.000 --> 47:51.000]  All right, so I feel such an urgency and I believe I talked to you a little bit about it already is food.
[47:51.000 --> 47:57.000]  Because of the over a hundred plants that are burnt and then cattle that are suddenly dying.
[47:57.000 --> 48:00.000]  They're trying to blame it on climate change, which that's not even true.
[48:00.000 --> 48:08.000]  And basically to create a food shortage so that they can then drive the people to the food, to the bread line.
[48:08.000 --> 48:16.000]  We started a major growing our five acres under greenhouses and we are growing in the middle of summer, which is unheard of here in Florida.
[48:16.000 --> 48:18.000]  But we're also mobilizing churches.
[48:18.000 --> 48:23.000]  What I'm trying to do is get churches in all 67 counties in the state of Florida to grow.
[48:23.000 --> 48:33.000]  And we actually got six other farms working with us and basically so that we can set up a marketplace and really feed the people.
[48:33.000 --> 48:37.000]  Because if there's a food shortage, they're going to end up in government food lines.
[48:37.000 --> 48:40.000]  But we should be on the front end of that.
[48:40.000 --> 48:42.000]  So we already took some heat over it.
[48:42.000 --> 48:44.000]  People said, well, what's that got to do with the gospel?
[48:44.000 --> 48:49.000]  I said, well, have you ever seen Jesus multiply the loaves and the fish to feed the multitudes?
[48:49.000 --> 48:53.000]  And I mean, so we've got to look after people and that's what we're doing.
[48:53.000 --> 49:01.000]  We're building a massive seed bank and a whole basically laboratory so we can test our own animals so they can't be clear.
[49:01.000 --> 49:04.000]  I didn't know you'd go here, but I watch your sermons almost every week.
[49:04.000 --> 49:06.000]  The Holy Spirit put it on you.
[49:06.000 --> 49:07.000]  Jesus is coming.
[49:07.000 --> 49:10.000]  And now they admit worldwide collapse, total famines.
[49:10.000 --> 49:12.000]  Gates is buying up all the seeds.
[49:12.000 --> 49:14.000]  They're trying to buy up all the farms.
[49:14.000 --> 49:18.000]  The answer is get all the churches involved in community farms and get others to and we have them in checkmate.
[49:18.000 --> 49:24.000]  So what the Holy Spirit told you to do what a couple of years ago has been now proven to be dead on.
[49:24.000 --> 49:25.000]  Yeah, totally.
[49:25.000 --> 49:30.000]  So we have cattle, we have sheep, whip, chicken, buzz for eggs and for meat.
[49:30.000 --> 49:36.000]  And also just to teach people how to grow and we've even got systems where they can grow in the inner city on your balcony.
[49:36.000 --> 49:43.000]  You can take a bag of soil, just poke holes in the plant seeds and then you can actually have vegetables every week.
[49:43.000 --> 49:48.000]  So, you know, people used to do that 100, 200 years ago, but people don't do that now.
[49:48.000 --> 49:51.000]  Everybody thinks they will just go to the supermarket and go buy.
[49:51.000 --> 49:53.000]  And the enemy knows that.
[49:53.000 --> 49:54.000]  That's our weak point.
[49:54.000 --> 49:56.000]  So you are so dead on with this.
[49:56.000 --> 50:04.000]  Yeah, so we set up like a training center here that's part of our university so people can send it as no charge, no charge at all.
[50:04.000 --> 50:08.000]  They can send people from their church and they can come spend three, four days.
[50:08.000 --> 50:11.000]  We'll show them how to grow, what they can do.
[50:11.000 --> 50:12.000]  And that's what's so beautiful.
[50:12.000 --> 50:14.000]  Most churches only work with themselves.
[50:14.000 --> 50:20.000]  You are trying to take ideas of God and resistance and you are a major leader.
[50:20.000 --> 50:22.000]  And it's not about obviously complimenting you.
[50:22.000 --> 50:25.000]  You have the model of victory that we should be following.
[50:25.000 --> 50:27.000]  Well, you know, here's the bottom line.
[50:27.000 --> 50:28.000]  I feed everybody.
[50:28.000 --> 50:31.000]  It doesn't matter if they're not part of our church or whatever.
[50:31.000 --> 50:33.000]  We feed everybody because people are people.
[50:33.000 --> 50:36.000]  So somebody said, well, I go to the first church or whatever.
[50:36.000 --> 50:37.000]  I don't really care.
[50:37.000 --> 50:38.000]  You're a human being.
[50:38.000 --> 50:40.000]  I'm going to take care of your food.
[50:40.000 --> 50:44.000]  We've been feeding, you know, 1,000 families every week in Tampa for over 20 years.
[50:44.000 --> 50:48.000]  That's why when I got arrested, the city was almost going to riot.
[50:48.000 --> 50:50.000]  You know, they were going to riot.
[50:50.000 --> 50:52.000]  So the bottom line is we have to do this.
[50:52.000 --> 50:57.000]  And the biggest problem I'm dealing with right now is trying to get pastors to catch the wave of it,
[50:57.000 --> 51:00.000]  to understand the importance of it.
[51:00.000 --> 51:02.000]  We're not just there to preach to them on Sundays,
[51:02.000 --> 51:05.000]  but we really need to take care of the congregation through the week.
[51:05.000 --> 51:10.000]  And obviously jobs, you know, all of this, all of this stuff.
[51:10.000 --> 51:12.000]  But I believe we can put people back to work.
[51:12.000 --> 51:17.000]  I believe we can, the whole economy can be built around each local church.
[51:17.000 --> 51:18.000]  That's right.
[51:18.000 --> 51:21.000]  The whole enemy attack is about us not having any communities.
[51:21.000 --> 51:25.000]  It was the churches that started the Revolutionary War that launched the country.
[51:25.000 --> 51:29.000]  It'll be the churches, again, finding their mission again that will save the country and the world.
[51:29.000 --> 51:30.000]  Yes.
[51:30.000 --> 51:35.000]  And Alex, I believe there's many pastors that want to do, but they don't know what to do.
[51:35.000 --> 51:37.000]  So I just got to try to get back in.
[51:37.000 --> 51:42.000]  My biggest frustration is trying to get the message to them and then for them to see,
[51:42.000 --> 51:45.000]  because in every congregation, there's people that love growing.
[51:45.000 --> 51:47.000]  They love growing, but they don't have an outlet.
[51:47.000 --> 51:52.000]  So, and especially seniors, as many seniors, what we've seen come out of the woodwork
[51:52.000 --> 51:56.000]  since I started all of this, other seniors coming from all over.
[51:56.000 --> 52:00.000]  Pastor, we grow, we farmers, we retire, we, can we help?
[52:00.000 --> 52:01.000]  We all want to help.
[52:01.000 --> 52:07.000]  We just had a conference here, we had a youth conference with just under 4,900 young people
[52:07.000 --> 52:09.000]  from the age of three to 19 for a whole week.
[52:09.000 --> 52:11.000]  They came from all across America.
[52:11.000 --> 52:19.000]  Then we had a, you know, for everybody, we had just on 7,000 come 28 countries, 50 states.
[52:19.000 --> 52:21.000]  And so it's in the middle of summer.
[52:21.000 --> 52:25.000]  I mean, our university is off, so they all come back now in another week or so.
[52:25.000 --> 52:29.000]  But they were all just sit on fire, went back home.
[52:29.000 --> 52:31.000]  We getting so many testimonies of kids.
[52:31.000 --> 52:34.000]  I put it, I put zip lines in the back of the pavilion.
[52:34.000 --> 52:35.000]  It was totally awesome.
[52:35.000 --> 52:37.000]  And many kids gave their life to the Lord.
[52:37.000 --> 52:44.000]  People that won the brink of suicide, kids, I mean, hurting themselves, you know, cutting themselves.
[52:44.000 --> 52:45.000]  We had all kinds of activities.
[52:45.000 --> 52:49.000]  You're getting them out of the satanic metaverse and into the Holy Spirit.
[52:49.000 --> 52:50.000]  Yes, sir.
[52:50.000 --> 52:51.000]  Yes, sir.
[52:51.000 --> 52:52.000]  And these kids are hungry for God.
[52:52.000 --> 52:53.000]  They just want Jesus.
[52:53.000 --> 52:58.000]  They, we did that special mud run thing, which is totally awesome.
[52:58.000 --> 52:59.000]  And cheering them on.
[52:59.000 --> 53:03.000]  Just for so great to see kids, you know, because they never get to do that.
[53:03.000 --> 53:13.000]  And remember, while the topless bars stayed open and while the mega grocery store stayed open and while the liquor store stayed open, they told the church is closed.
[53:13.000 --> 53:17.000]  Yeah, yeah, we must close, but you can go gamble.
[53:17.000 --> 53:18.000]  We must close.
[53:18.000 --> 53:24.000]  And I said, as long as Walmart's open, as long as there's 24 hour Walmart, there'll be 24 hour of a church.
[53:24.000 --> 53:26.000]  And we're not shutting down.
[53:26.000 --> 53:34.000]  So, you know, my mind's already working ahead towards, like you said earlier, about the coming lockdowns and what they want to implement.
[53:34.000 --> 53:37.000]  And I know all of that, but I can't just spend my time on that.
[53:37.000 --> 53:41.000]  I have to move ahead of, I got to get ahead of the curve.
[53:41.000 --> 53:52.000]  And the only way is for mobilization of the body of Christ and mobilizing everybody, hitting the schools, hitting every school, every university, from the daycare to the university.
[53:52.000 --> 54:05.000]  And then from the crack house to the penthouse to the schoolhouse, the jailhouse, the outhouse, as I always say, and mobilizing everybody, knocking on doors and just like costing, costing a net across the whole region.
[54:05.000 --> 54:15.000]  Talking about Jesus, let people get on fire for God was the only hope really, as you know, in American history is another great spiritual awakening.
[54:15.000 --> 54:18.000]  All right, Pastor, stay right there.
[54:18.000 --> 54:30.000]  You're going to do the first five minutes. I've asked you during the break to lead us in prayer and talk about hope and how people that are depressed or under, you know, this demonic attack, how they can reach out to Jesus and break free from it.
[54:30.000 --> 54:34.000]  Particularly a message for those that don't know God and never experienced the Holy Spirit.
[54:34.000 --> 54:41.000]  You're going to do the first five minutes and I really ask you to come on soon for a full hour to really talk about the spiritual warfare we're in.
[54:41.000 --> 54:46.000]  We're going to go to break here in a few minutes and we're going to come right back with you. Please stay there.
[54:46.000 --> 54:50.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, you have seen the enemy try to shut us down.
[54:50.000 --> 54:58.000]  You've seen them with thousands of articles a day and every major TV network owned by the globalist attacking us and lying about us and trying to shut us down.
[54:58.000 --> 55:05.000]  You've seen them lie in court and say that I make $300 million a year or that I made $61 million last year.
[55:05.000 --> 55:11.000]  I don't have $5 million in my net worth and I wish I had $100 million because we could do a lot more.
[55:11.000 --> 55:22.000]  They have lied to this jury. They have told them that I'm guilty up front and they've already done a $4 million judgment versus the $150 million they asked for.
[55:22.000 --> 55:28.000]  That is a victory. With the judge instructing them, you must find him guilty. You must give them something.
[55:28.000 --> 55:35.000]  This is a big deal. They have the punitive damages coming out today. Am I worried about it? No, it could be a billion dollars. I don't have it.
[55:35.000 --> 55:45.000]  We're in bankruptcy so we can prove that we don't have all this money and we will continue on. But if we don't have the basic money to keep the lights on and run the operation and pay for the crew and pay for legal,
[55:45.000 --> 55:55.000]  we will shut down by the weight of these George Soros, Bloomberg, we know one of the main firms that he uses is involved countering our bankruptcy right here in Texas.
[55:55.000 --> 56:02.000]  They're coming for us because they're coming for you. But if you will provision us and commission us and keep us in the fight,
[56:02.000 --> 56:06.000]  you have my promise that we will not back down or give in, but we could give out.
[56:06.000 --> 56:13.000]  So if we do not have your support, we'll be shut down and we are barely, barely even able to fund this bankruptcy and go through this.
[56:13.000 --> 56:21.000]  So I need you to go to infowarstore.com and get a copy of the new great reset, The War for the World, that describes the whole New World Order.
[56:21.000 --> 56:28.000]  This is my masterwork at infowarstore.com. The new film that's out to have it on DVD, Alex's War, our 28 year war against the globalist.

[57:40.000 --> 57:44.000]  That is my prayer. That is my hope. And I want to thank you all for your past support.
[57:44.000 --> 57:50.000]  Thank you so much. Now the ball is in your court.
[57:50.000 --> 58:03.000]  The great reset in the war for the world is the book that the government doesn't want you to read that most of the big powerful companies trying to control your life, the big tech companies, they don't want you to read this book.
[58:03.000 --> 58:08.000]  They want to control what you think, what you do, what you read, but you don't want that.
[58:08.000 --> 58:15.000]  And Alex Jones doesn't want that. And this book shows you what's happening and gives you the sort of playbook for how to fight against it.
[58:15.000 --> 58:22.000]  And so by buying this book, you're going to prove that censorship doesn't work, that freedom is alive in this country.
[58:22.000 --> 58:28.000]  This is a central reading. And, you know, I would go right now and buy it before the censorship kicks in.
[58:28.000 --> 58:33.000]  It's not going to be available in bookstores. It's not going to be available in libraries.
[58:33.000 --> 58:38.000]  They're going to try to take it down from every platform that they can, but they're not going to be able to do it.
[58:38.000 --> 58:43.000]  Prove that censorship doesn't work. Buy the great reset. Thank you, Alex Jones.
[58:43.000 --> 59:12.000]  I really appreciate you having me on and I appreciate you writing this book and getting the information out there.
[59:12.000 --> 59:18.000]  You went and looked at the top 10 and they all have the same ingredients in common that is in this product.
[59:18.000 --> 59:30.000]  But with our new product from X7 Diet Force, we got the very best concentrates of these known natural essences that's just two amazing things for your body.
[59:30.000 --> 59:38.000]  And so I've lost almost 40 pounds. I'm so a little bit overweight in the last three months and I've been doing it using Diet Force and also Exercise.
[59:38.000 --> 59:44.000]  Well, now Diet Force is exclusively available right now at infowarsstore.com, 40% off.
[59:44.000 --> 59:50.000]  Infowarsstore.com, Diet Force. You need to take this product. It really works.
[59:50.000 --> 1:00:03.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:03.000 --> 1:00:08.000]  The enemy is trying to cut us off. They're trying to not let us have access to our fellow humans.
[1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:12.000]  They're trying to isolate us in the metaverse. They're trying to cut us off from God.
[1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:17.000]  They're trying to keep us from going to church. Pastor Rodney Howard Brown right now is going to lead us in prayer.
[1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:23.000]  And speak to those who've been isolated or have never experienced God. Reach out and God will be there.
[1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:29.000]  But God is a free will God, unlike Satan. You have to reach out. Pastor Brown.
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:38.000]  So as you're watching right now, people say, well, I don't believe there's a God, but the fact is you actually do.
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:44.000]  You just don't want to acknowledge that you can't look at creation and not realize someone bigger.
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  This is a master design from when you look out at the stars, when you see creation, when you look at a baby being born.
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  So that didn't just happen, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  So here's what I always tell people that have never experienced God. Just call out.
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  Say, God, if you're real, show yourself to me. We have many testimonies from people around the world that didn't believe there was a God.
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  But then they said, OK, if you are really real, then show yourself to me.
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  Reveal yourself to me. And God came and showed them in no uncertain terms that he is alive.
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:20.000]  So I want to pray for you right now. And I'm going to actually pray a prayer where you can actually ask him.
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  First of all, I'll pray two prayers. The first one, I'm going to ask him to read himself to you.
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  Then the second one, for those that want to surrender your life to him right now.
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  And we'll just do that on the air. So let's do that.
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  Father, as people are watching right now, and many that are seeking, they don't know,
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  maybe never grew up around church, or the experience they had around church was terrible.
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:50.000]  But I pray that you would reveal yourself to them and show that you are alive.
[1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:56.000]  So pray this off me, say, God, if you are really, really real, then show yourself to me.
[1:01:56.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  Reveal yourself to me. If you prove yourself to me, I will serve you all the days of my life.
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  And now for the people that want to give your life to the Lord.
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  Why don't you just do this right now? Just say, dear Lord Jesus, come into my heart.
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  Forgive me of my sin. Wash me in your blood.
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:20.000]  Thank you that 2,000 years ago, you died on the cross of Calvary for me.
[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  And you gave your life for me. And that today, I repent of my sin.
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  Coming to my heart now, I confess Jesus Christ is my Lord and my Savior.
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:37.000]  And I thank you that you died for me. You were buried for me.
[1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  And you rose from the dead for me. And you're coming back again for me.
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:47.000]  Thank you even now for saving me.
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:50.000]  Now, Father, I pray for every person that prayed that prayer.
[1:02:50.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  I pray for the peace of God to flood their life. Fill them with your Holy Spirit.
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:59.000]  Fill them with your anointing that they would know that you're with them.
[1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  They are not alone. That when they're lying there bed at night, they can talk to you.
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  And you talk to them. And Father, I pray a hunger would come upon them
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:10.000]  that they're beginning to read their Bible because your word speaks to us.
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  And as your word speaks to us, that you would guide them.
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  That you would help them realize why they are alive at this hour.
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:20.000]  They're not here by accident. They're here by God's divine purpose.
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  And I pray that every person listening to me, you would find Heaven's purpose for your life.
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:28.000]  You're not just here in existence.
[1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:33.000]  God has ordained that you be here at this day and this hour, that your voice will be lifted up
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:37.000]  and your voice will be heard and you're going to touch people that no one else can touch.
[1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:41.000]  So this is very, very important and that God will use you the remainder of your days.
[1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:45.000]  And some of you might say I'm too young. You're right. You're just the right age.
[1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:47.000]  Some might say I'm too old for this.
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  God can use you in the next three years to be what would be the equivalent of a whole lifetime
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:56.000]  if you would just yield to Him right now and talk to Him.
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  If you talk to God, He will talk to you and He will lead you and He will guide you.
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  Please read your Bible. Very important.
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:05.000]  Start with the Gospel. Start with Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:10.000]  Then read the Book of Acts so you can see the power that's available to the church in this hour.
[1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:14.000]  Don't listen to outside voices. Listen to what the Word of God says.
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:15.000]  Very, very important.
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  If you're anywhere in the Tampa, Florida area, come visit us here.
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  You can go to our website for bible.com.
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:22.000]  You can also fill out one of the forms.
[1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  I'll send you a book, 500 page book on Jesus for free.
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:27.000]  It'll bless you.
[1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  Of course, seeing Jesus as He really is.
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  If you're anywhere around, you can't visit us.
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  Come see what's happening. Come get involved.
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:36.000]  We have a university. We give away scholarships.
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:38.000]  God can use you.
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  Pastor Brown, thank you so much. Please visit us again soon.
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  I will, sir. Anytime you want. Just tell me.
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  Thank you for all the kind text you sent me.
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:52.000]  God bless you and your family, sir. Thank you.
[1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  We're praying for you, Alex. Love you so much.
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:56.000]  Love you too.
[1:05:49.000 --> 1:05:52.000]  The Great Reset by Alex Jones.
[1:05:52.000 --> 1:05:57.000]  Order your copy now at Amazon or InfowarsStore.com.
[1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:38.000]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Friday show.
[1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:41.000]  We've got so much coming up.
[1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:43.000]  People are really excited about the guests that Mike Adams has
[1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:45.000]  on the death of Western civilization.
[1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:47.000]  He lives in Ukraine.
[1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:49.000]  Why it's about to go to the next level
[1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:51.000]  and how we can work together to stop it.
[1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:55.000]  That's coming up and so much more today.
[1:06:55.000 --> 1:07:01.000]  And you know,
[1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:07.000]  they're trying to distract me from my work,
[1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:12.000]  but they're not going to distract me from my work.
[1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:17.000]  And that's why I'm not down there at the second phase of the trial today,
[1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:22.000]  is because no matter what the globalists do,
[1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:27.000]  while I'm still breathing air or while I'm not locked up in a prison,
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:31.000]  I am going to be fighting these people.
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:35.000]  It's that simple, but I can't stand the fight without you.
[1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:37.000]  So they want me to talk about their attacks.
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:39.000]  They want me to get diverted into defending myself,
[1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:42.000]  but you understand we're going to stay in the attack
[1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:45.000]  and we're not going to let them distract us.
[1:07:45.000 --> 1:07:49.000]  What is it that they're trying to distract us from?
[1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:55.000]  Well, there's this stack and there's this stack
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:08:03.000]  that they're trying to distract us with.
[1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  They're trying to distract us from knowing about what I'm about to cover.
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:15.000]  And so I'll be back today in the fourth hour
[1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:18.000]  and I'm going to co-host with Robert Barnes.
[1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  And then I'll be back today co-hosting some in the war room
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  because I'm not going to let them silence us.
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:25.000]  And tomorrow I'm going to be here most of the day,
[1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  even though my five-year-old daughter is begging me to take her fishing.
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:32.000]  She has no future if I don't do this, so I'll be here.
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:34.000]  And I'm not a martyr. I'm not a victim.
[1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:36.000]  I'm saying that I'm going to work harder
[1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:38.000]  because they're trying to silence us
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:40.000]  because I know it's our mission.
[1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  And when I get tired and think it must be somebody else's job to do this,
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  when I see it bearing fruit what we've done together,
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:49.000]  I realize I've got to fight now harder than I ever had.
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:51.000]  So I'll cover this more in the fourth hour today
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  after Mike Adams takes over with some special guests
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:55.000]  and things he's outlined up that are huge.
[1:08:55.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  People are really excited.
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:09:00.000]  Let me just hit these headlines so you know what's coming up.
[1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:02.000]  These all tie together.
[1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:06.000]  Swedish scientists advocates eating humans to combat climate change.
[1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:08.000]  It's all over the news.
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:10.000]  I told you that was coming.
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:12.000]  Video transcript.
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:14.000]  Biden Transport Secretary again touts
[1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:18.000]  expensive electric vehicles as solution for high gas prices.
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  Hippocrates Trudeau caught masclists after flying on a private jet,
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:25.000]  but he says you shouldn't be able to have air conditioning for a car.
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  The climate cult is eager to take advantage of Europe's energy crisis,
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  and they're now announcing in Spain and Germany
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  they're going to control remotely, as we told you decades they would,
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  with the smart meters, what temperature you can set your house to,
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  no lower than 80.
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  And then of course later, no air conditioning at all.
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:46.000]  But the real trick is they're training you that they're surveilling you
[1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  and control devices in your house.
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  That's the big issue, not them controlling just the temperature,
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  but that they're doing it.
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  They're surveilling it, they're controlling it.
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:57.000]  Goodbye car ownership.
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  Hello, clean air. Welcome to the future of transport
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:01.000]  where no one can own cars but the ultra rich
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:05.000]  and everything else is self-driving cars that pick you up,
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:08.000]  making humans obsolete.
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:10.000]  What would happen if we remove cars from cities?
[1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  Globalist WEF urges people to give up car ownership.
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:17.000]  World Economic Forum calls for reducing private vehicles by eliminating ownership.
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:19.000]  You'll own nothing and love it.
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  Wide spread civil unrest looming in the UK over cost of living crisis.
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  Do you like the new world order so far?
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:30.000]  The Land Report. Meet farmer Bill Gates.
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  Australia's Great Barrier Reef defies climate doomsayers
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  with record coral comeback.
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  The truth is coral reefs grow, they die, they come back, they die, they come back.
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  Major new findings, they're reanimating not just dead spiders,
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  but now pigs.
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  Frankenstein is real.
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:49.000]  From NBC News.
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  Welcome to 2030.
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  I own nothing, I have no privacy and life's never been better.
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  Forbes.
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  Cruises self-driving cars stopped and clogged up San Francisco for hours.
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  Apple self-driving cars smacked into curbs veered out of lanes.
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:08.000]  We have one almost hit us today driving back from court in Austin.
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:14.000]  GM's hands-free driving tech is set for massive expansion.
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:22.000]  Driverless EV, taxi fleet shows possible climate benefits of autonomous vehicles.
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:25.000]  And all the studies show 5G causes major asthma and problems.
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  And I'm literally driving down Congress this morning after an hour in court to get to the show.
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  And I'm coughing the way I've never coughed in my life.
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:41.000]  And I said, you know, the studies are 5G causes serious breathing problems.
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  And in coughing like this, it only happens when I'm in 5G areas.
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:48.000]  They need those for self-driving cars.
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  And all of a sudden a Ford self-driving car drives by,
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  but it went in the turn lane, we didn't get video of it.
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:57.000]  A robot car drove by two minutes after I was telling my security guys that.
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  It was crazy.
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  Two simple self-driving cars, semi-truck crashes, veers into renewed scrutiny.
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  But see, it's training you for the metaverse, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:10.000]  5G technology to help reduce traffic congestion,
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:12.000]  support self-driving cars in Malaysia.
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:15.000]  See what I'm talking about?
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  Here's what else they don't want you to know about.
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:24.000]  COVID vaccines are killing one in every 800 over 60s.
[1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  It should be withdrawn immediately as leading vaccine scientists.
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:29.000]  Wait till I cover this fourth hour.
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  Quadrupled back to German health minister test positive for COVID.
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  COVID-19 anti-function hearing exposes Fauci's crimes against humanity.
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:39.000]  Did you get to those clips yesterday?
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:40.000]  There's been more hearings.
[1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  We'll have that in the fourth hour.
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:45.000]  And Robert Barnes is the main lawyer successfully suing Pfizer with whistleblowers
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  and getting the documents out.
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  And Tulsi Gabbards came out and said,
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  Biden's promoting child abuse by pushing gender affirming care.
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  That ties in to a whole host of articles and breaking news fourth hour.
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:02.000]  But the next hour and 45 minutes, the great Mike Adams is going to be taking over.
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  Separately, I don't make a lot of money.
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:11.000]  I wish we did to fund this operation off of the great reset in the war for the world
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  when you buy it at Amazon.com.
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:15.000]  But it's in the top 30 books in the world.
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:18.000]  It's in over 30 charts now as number one.
[1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:24.000]  Politics, political science, history, world history, U.S. history, media.
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  Get it at Amazon.com, the great reset in the war for the world.
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:30.000]  Alex Jones or buy it at infowarstore.com.
[1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  And we're about to sell out the limited signed copies because I cannot sign more than 5,000 books.
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  I'm just not going to have other people sign it.
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:40.000]  It's a moral thing I got to do.
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  I got to sign 5,000 books that are almost sold out.
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:45.000]  Well, I might just say 20,000 if everybody wants it.
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:47.000]  It keeps it on air all the way up to 10 hours and do it.
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  But those are at infowarstore.com.
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  But this is do or die time.
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:59.000]  On my children and on my immortal soul, they're lying in court with no evidence.
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  They blocked us from putting on evidence.
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:02.000]  It's kangaroo court.
[1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  They're in a punitive damages phase saying I made $61 million last year.
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  Saying I have hundreds of millions of dollars saying my net worth is over $100 million.
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:16.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I was ready to testify.
[1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:20.000]  We took a lot of days and time to get this ready.
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  I was ready to testify that my net worth is less than $5 million.
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  And that my overall, before these judgments, debt is more than $20 million.
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  On my immortal soul, and I wish I had millions of dollars to fight these people,
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  George Soros has spent over $40 million buying up the DEA's and taking over.
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  And the world's waking up saying God, I wish I had $40 million.
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  We could beat these people.
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:52.000]  But what I'm saying is it's a lie.
[1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  They put that out there to get a big judgment and to make you think we don't need support.
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:15:01.000]  I need you to go to infowarstore.com forward slash crypto and make a donation to Bitcoin or other systems.

[1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:04.000]  We would be shut down right now.
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:05.000]  It wasn't for you.

[1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:58.000]  Mike Adams and a huge guest comes up now.
[1:15:58.000 --> 1:16:02.000]  The great reset in the war for the world is the book that the government doesn't want
[1:16:02.000 --> 1:16:07.000]  you to read, that most of the big powerful companies trying to control your life, the
[1:16:07.000 --> 1:16:10.400]  big tech companies, they don't want you to read this book.
[1:16:10.400 --> 1:16:15.000]  They want to control what you think, what you do, what you read, but you don't want
[1:16:15.000 --> 1:16:16.000]  that.
[1:16:16.000 --> 1:16:17.000]  And Alex Jones doesn't want that.
[1:16:17.000 --> 1:16:21.760]  And this book shows you what's happening and gives you the sort of playbook for how
[1:16:21.760 --> 1:16:23.000]  to fight against it.
[1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:27.500]  And so by buying this book, you're going to prove that censorship doesn't work, that
[1:16:27.500 --> 1:16:29.720]  freedom is alive in this country.
[1:16:29.720 --> 1:16:31.760]  This is a central reading.
[1:16:31.760 --> 1:16:36.400]  And you know, I would go right now and buy it before the censorship kicks in.
[1:16:36.400 --> 1:16:38.640]  It's not going to be available in bookstores.
[1:16:38.640 --> 1:16:40.840]  It's not going to be available in libraries.
[1:16:40.840 --> 1:16:44.480]  They're going to try to take it down from every platform that they can, but they're
[1:16:44.480 --> 1:16:49.440]  not going to be able to do it, prove that censorship doesn't work by the great reset.
[1:16:49.440 --> 1:16:50.440]  Thank you, Alex Jones.
[1:16:50.440 --> 1:16:54.600]  I really appreciate you having me on and I appreciate you writing this book and getting

[1:19:52.720 --> 1:19:58.120]  I can't wait for the reviews because it's worked great for me.
[1:19:58.120 --> 1:20:11.000]  Meeting a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:11.000 --> 1:20:21.040]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones with Mike Adams.
[1:20:21.040 --> 1:20:22.800]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:22.800 --> 1:20:27.960]  Mike Adams, you're stepping in for the next hour and a half or so with an extraordinary
[1:20:27.960 --> 1:20:30.240]  guest coming up just in a minute or so.
[1:20:30.240 --> 1:20:39.160]  Gonzalo Lira joins us from Kharkov, Ukraine, and he is just spot on, I believe, the best
[1:20:39.160 --> 1:20:44.120]  analyst that's watching this situation up close and personal.
[1:20:44.120 --> 1:20:50.640]  We're going to bring you an extraordinary big picture view analysis of the suicide of
[1:20:50.640 --> 1:20:56.960]  Western Europe in particular with questions about what's happening with Western civilization.
[1:20:56.960 --> 1:20:59.760]  Are we past the point of rationality?
[1:20:59.760 --> 1:21:04.800]  In fact, what's going on right here right now in info wars, the studio today and with
[1:21:04.800 --> 1:21:10.680]  Alex in the court case, I believe it's a microcosm of what's happening on the world stage.
[1:21:10.680 --> 1:21:16.080]  We're watching the suicide of the judicial system, in my opinion, right here in Austin,
[1:21:16.080 --> 1:21:17.080]  Texas.
[1:21:17.080 --> 1:21:22.720]  What we've done to Alex, in my opinion, is a kind of railroading and it's an abandonment
[1:21:22.720 --> 1:21:26.200]  of the very pillars that keep society functioning.
[1:21:26.200 --> 1:21:31.960]  We cannot function as a nation if we don't have a fair and unbiased judicial system,
[1:21:31.960 --> 1:21:36.080]  if we don't have a functioning sixth amendment where people are able to present witnesses
[1:21:36.080 --> 1:21:40.400]  and evidence in their own defense or to testify on their own behalf.
[1:21:40.400 --> 1:21:44.360]  But that's just one small sign of what's actually happening in the world.
[1:21:44.360 --> 1:21:48.640]  So we're going to bring in Gonzalo Lira right now to talk about the bigger picture.
[1:21:48.640 --> 1:21:52.840]  We'll start with a little update on Russia and Ukraine, but the bigger picture from
[1:21:52.840 --> 1:21:53.840]  there.
[1:21:53.840 --> 1:21:56.240]  Mr. Lira, it's an honor to have you on.
[1:21:56.240 --> 1:21:57.240]  Thank you for joining us.
[1:21:57.240 --> 1:22:00.480]  I know you're late at night there in Ukraine, but thank you.
[1:22:00.480 --> 1:22:02.600]  Welcome to the show.
[1:22:02.600 --> 1:22:03.800]  Thank you so much for having me.
[1:22:03.800 --> 1:22:05.640]  It's a pleasure to be on.
[1:22:05.640 --> 1:22:11.560]  Well, Gonzalo, I just want to let people know you're joining us from Kharkov, Ukraine.
[1:22:11.560 --> 1:22:17.320]  Your audio and video may not be 100%, but it's pretty solid, and I just want to ask
[1:22:17.320 --> 1:22:20.840]  people to have some patience with it because of your location right now.
[1:22:20.840 --> 1:22:22.720]  But thank you very much.
[1:22:22.720 --> 1:22:23.720]  Absolutely.
[1:22:23.720 --> 1:22:28.960]  And first of all, let me say that your work, Gonzalo, especially since Russia began the
[1:22:28.960 --> 1:22:35.440]  special military operation in Ukraine, your work has been so spot on that I jokingly tell
[1:22:35.440 --> 1:22:41.440]  my friends that, yeah, the U.S. State Department may be blinking, but Gonzalo Lira has not
[1:22:41.440 --> 1:22:44.280]  blinked at all, so I think you're nailing it.
[1:22:44.280 --> 1:22:45.840]  That's very kind of you to say.
[1:22:45.840 --> 1:22:51.480]  Now the situation here in Ukraine is eminently predictable, and whatever they're saying in
[1:22:51.480 --> 1:22:57.720]  the West is nonsense, quite frankly, because what is happening right now is what everybody
[1:22:57.720 --> 1:23:01.800]  realized was going to happen six months ago, five and a half months ago when this special
[1:23:01.800 --> 1:23:05.520]  military operation started, which is that Russia is winning.
[1:23:05.520 --> 1:23:06.840]  It's definitively winning.
[1:23:06.840 --> 1:23:12.920]  It is the victory on the part of the Russians is overwhelming, and the people who are bleeding
[1:23:12.920 --> 1:23:17.320]  that the Russians are losing, that it's a static war and work, whatnot, they simply
[1:23:17.320 --> 1:23:18.960]  don't want to see reality.
[1:23:18.960 --> 1:23:24.720]  What's happened in the West is that people think that if you say something often enough,
[1:23:24.720 --> 1:23:26.840]  it will somehow change reality.
[1:23:26.840 --> 1:23:33.640]  But reality stays the same, reality is real, and you can create all kinds of narratives
[1:23:33.640 --> 1:23:38.240]  and spin any story that you want to, but the facts on the ground won't change.
[1:23:38.240 --> 1:23:42.880]  And the facts on the ground, insofar as the Zelensky regime is concerned, are catastrophic.
[1:23:42.880 --> 1:23:49.080]  The Ukraine armed forces are losing something between 500 and 1,000 soldiers a day, which
[1:23:49.080 --> 1:23:51.360]  is an astronomical number.
[1:23:51.360 --> 1:23:54.960]  And these numbers are increasing because of course what's happening is that the Zelensky
[1:23:54.960 --> 1:24:00.760]  regime forces are getting progressively weaker every day, whereas the Russians, they're just
[1:24:00.760 --> 1:24:03.040]  getting into the swing of things.
[1:24:03.040 --> 1:24:07.720]  You have to understand, when you look at the Russian army, when they went into the special
[1:24:07.720 --> 1:24:14.000]  military operation in late February and February 24th, they didn't go in with their top tier
[1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:18.880]  equipment, their best tanks, their best missile systems, their best air defenses.
[1:24:18.880 --> 1:24:22.600]  They went in with their second tier, and a lot of analysts in the West had been wondering
[1:24:22.600 --> 1:24:23.600]  about that.
[1:24:23.600 --> 1:24:28.520]  And it was very obvious why, because the Russians knew that they could handle the Zelensky regime
[1:24:28.520 --> 1:24:33.160]  forces with their second tier material, their second tier tanks and whatnot.
[1:24:33.160 --> 1:24:37.480]  And they needed to keep on, keep hold of their top tier equipment in case they had to go
[1:24:37.480 --> 1:24:39.240]  to war with NATO.
[1:24:39.240 --> 1:24:43.720]  But what happened, of course, is that NATO, the United States, the Pentagon, because that's
[1:24:43.720 --> 1:24:44.720]  what we're talking about.
[1:24:44.720 --> 1:24:49.840]  Whenever we talk about NATO, we're really talking about the Department of Defense, the Pentagon.
[1:24:49.840 --> 1:24:53.920]  And what happened was that they got a good look at what the Russians could do.
[1:24:53.920 --> 1:24:56.120]  And they realized that they wanted no part of it.
[1:24:56.120 --> 1:24:59.880]  Because in the United States, it's the State Department, and to a lesser extent, the Biden
[1:24:59.880 --> 1:25:05.880]  administration that wants to go into Ukraine, fight, have U.S. soldiers fighting directly
[1:25:05.880 --> 1:25:06.880]  against the Russians.
[1:25:06.880 --> 1:25:08.800]  They're the ones who want this.
[1:25:08.800 --> 1:25:13.760]  It's the Department of Defense that does not want this because they know they'll lose.
[1:25:13.760 --> 1:25:17.760]  And this is a very bitter pill, and a lot of people in the United States don't like
[1:25:17.760 --> 1:25:19.320]  this fact, but it's the truth.
[1:25:19.320 --> 1:25:20.320]  But Gonzalo, it's...
[1:25:20.320 --> 1:25:21.320]  The Russians...
[1:25:21.320 --> 1:25:25.160]  I'm sorry to interrupt, but you're absolutely correct, I believe, in what you said.
[1:25:25.160 --> 1:25:29.640]  It's not just that NATO and the State Department and the Pentagon realized that they would
[1:25:29.640 --> 1:25:35.320]  lose in this context, but that they are willing to sacrifice the lives of so many innocent
[1:25:35.320 --> 1:25:37.000]  Ukrainians.
[1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:39.560]  And my question to you, sir, is...
[1:25:39.560 --> 1:25:43.960]  You've heard the phrase that NATO is willing to fight Russia to the last Ukrainian, which
[1:25:43.960 --> 1:25:46.880]  I believe is a crime against the people of Ukraine.
[1:25:46.880 --> 1:25:52.440]  But is it also at risk of expanding where NATO is willing to fight Russia to the last
[1:25:52.440 --> 1:25:55.240]  European?
[1:25:55.240 --> 1:26:01.040]  Well, that's what they actually did, because you see, all these sanctions, right?
[1:26:01.040 --> 1:26:06.520]  You have to understand, suppose this, suppose, you know, I say, you know, I don't like my
[1:26:06.520 --> 1:26:10.240]  local supermarket, and I'm not going to buy anything from the local supermarket because
[1:26:10.240 --> 1:26:11.560]  I'm going to punish them.
[1:26:11.560 --> 1:26:12.560]  Okay?
[1:26:12.560 --> 1:26:15.680]  Well, who actually gets harmed by this?
[1:26:15.680 --> 1:26:16.680]  The supermarket?
[1:26:16.680 --> 1:26:19.400]  No, because the supermarket can find other customers.
[1:26:19.400 --> 1:26:25.960]  Me? I get harmed because I have to drive much farther away to buy the same products that
[1:26:25.960 --> 1:26:28.960]  I need because I need to eat, okay?
[1:26:28.960 --> 1:26:35.800]  In the case of Europe, they need Russian gas, they need Russian oil, they need Russian food
[1:26:35.800 --> 1:26:42.000]  because they do not produce enough gas, oil, food to supply themselves.
[1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:47.000]  And so what happened by imposing these sanctions, which they claim to work on other countries
[1:26:47.000 --> 1:26:50.800]  like Iran, Venezuela and whatnot, it actually never did.
[1:26:50.800 --> 1:26:56.640]  I mean, Cuba has been under sanctions for going on 60 years, and it hasn't done anything
[1:26:56.640 --> 1:27:01.320]  to the Cuban leadership, although it certainly has harmed the Cuban people, right?
[1:27:01.320 --> 1:27:05.160]  Because these sanctions only hurt the people, the people at the top, the leaders of the
[1:27:05.160 --> 1:27:07.960]  countries that are being sanctions, they're not hurting at all.
[1:27:07.960 --> 1:27:14.360]  But anyway, sanctions only work for small countries, but for a big country like Russia,
[1:27:14.360 --> 1:27:15.360]  and it is big.
[1:27:15.360 --> 1:27:16.440]  It's a huge country.
[1:27:16.440 --> 1:27:19.520]  It has a population of 145 million people.
[1:27:19.520 --> 1:27:24.280]  And a lot of people say that, oh, its GDP is only the size of like, Italy's or Spain
[1:27:24.280 --> 1:27:25.720]  or something like that.
[1:27:25.720 --> 1:27:31.120]  That's nominally accurate, but when you actually start looking into the fine details, you realize
[1:27:31.120 --> 1:27:35.880]  that that's not the case, the Russian economy is actually the largest in Europe when you
[1:27:35.880 --> 1:27:37.280]  start actually measuring it.
[1:27:37.280 --> 1:27:39.520]  It's larger than Germany's or the UK's.
[1:27:39.520 --> 1:27:43.960]  And so what happens is that sanctions on Russia don't hurt the Russians because they have
[1:27:43.960 --> 1:27:49.760]  other buyers for their oil, for their gas, for their food, and Europe doesn't.
[1:27:49.760 --> 1:27:55.320]  And so by imposing these sanctions, the Europeans following the American leadership of doing
[1:27:55.320 --> 1:27:59.400]  all these sanctions against Russia, the Europeans only hurt themselves.
[1:27:59.400 --> 1:28:06.200]  Germany, one of the best organized countries in the planet, is going to have rolling blackouts.
[1:28:06.200 --> 1:28:09.880]  They're not going to have enough heat for their people, and they are likely not going
[1:28:09.880 --> 1:28:16.000]  to have enough food this winter, which is insane, but it is because of these sanctions.
[1:28:16.000 --> 1:28:19.080]  Let me stop you right there.
[1:28:19.080 --> 1:28:24.720]  I want to get into that in much more detail, your predictions about what Germany is facing,
[1:28:24.720 --> 1:28:28.080]  because as people know, the Nord Stream 1 pipeline is currently running, I believe at
[1:28:28.080 --> 1:28:33.840]  about 20%, and Gazprom is stating that they won't be able to get parts for it, turbine
[1:28:33.840 --> 1:28:37.080]  repairs and maintenance and so on, because of the economic sanctions.
[1:28:37.080 --> 1:28:41.880]  So specifically to your point, let's talk, when we come back after this break, let's
[1:28:41.880 --> 1:28:47.920]  talk about what's going to happen in Germany, Germany's industry, housing, heating, freezing,
[1:28:47.920 --> 1:28:50.040]  starving, this coming winter.
[1:28:50.040 --> 1:28:53.600]  This is the Alex Jones Show, I'm Mike Adams with Gonzalo Lira, we'll be right back after
[1:28:53.600 --> 1:28:55.480]  this break with that and more.
[1:28:55.480 --> 1:29:01.680]  People say Alex Jones is crazy, he's a conspiracy theory guy, he's a nutcase, he's got these
[1:29:01.680 --> 1:29:08.760]  rants and all that, what they miss is that this guy's a head of the curve on so many
[1:29:08.760 --> 1:29:11.360]  different topics of signal, not noise.
[1:29:11.360 --> 1:29:18.320]  If you look at the signal, and you compare that to PBS and NPR and BBC and we'll do what
[1:29:18.320 --> 1:29:23.720]  Alex Jones put out there versus what your collective body has put out there, and if
[1:29:23.720 --> 1:29:27.440]  you're sitting in a human being and just watching it and you say, well, Alex Jones was a head
[1:29:27.440 --> 1:29:31.560]  of this, not only that, he kind of explained it, you are one of the great thinkers of
[1:29:31.560 --> 1:29:32.560]  this.
[1:29:32.560 --> 1:29:37.600]  That is very rare, you've got to go back almost to the revolutionary generation and see that.
[1:29:37.600 --> 1:29:40.880]  In this new book, I've got to tell you, when Tony Lyons first approached me, I read this
[1:29:40.880 --> 1:29:45.840]  thing, I go, this is it, this is no Beatrix, you're not going to be flipping pages or you're
[1:29:45.840 --> 1:29:48.320]  going to be having a pen out and you're going to be underlining stuff.
[1:29:48.320 --> 1:29:58.120]  The Great Reset by Alex Jones, order your copy now at Amazon or InfowarsStore.com.
[1:29:58.120 --> 1:30:02.240]  The Great Reset in the War for the World is the book that the government doesn't want
[1:30:02.240 --> 1:30:07.240]  you to read, that most of the big, powerful companies trying to control your life, the
[1:30:07.240 --> 1:30:10.620]  big tech companies, they don't want you to read this book.
[1:30:10.620 --> 1:30:15.240]  They want to control what you think, what you do, what you read, but you don't want
[1:30:15.240 --> 1:30:16.240]  that.
[1:30:16.240 --> 1:30:20.000]  And Alex Jones doesn't want that, and this book shows you what's happening and gives
[1:30:20.000 --> 1:30:23.240]  you the sort of playbook for how to fight against it.
[1:30:23.240 --> 1:30:27.760]  And so by buying this book, you're going to prove that censorship doesn't work, that
[1:30:27.760 --> 1:30:33.320]  freedom is alive in this country, this is a central reading, and I would go right now
[1:30:33.320 --> 1:30:38.800]  and buy it before the censorship kicks in, it's not going to be available in bookstores,
[1:30:38.800 --> 1:30:42.600]  it's not going to be available in libraries, they're going to try to take it down from
[1:30:42.600 --> 1:30:46.720]  every platform that they can, but they're not going to be able to do it, prove that
[1:30:46.720 --> 1:30:48.320]  censorship doesn't work.
[1:30:48.320 --> 1:30:52.320]  By the Great Reset, thank you, Alex Jones, I really appreciate you having me on, and
[1:30:52.320 --> 1:30:57.200]  I appreciate you writing this book and getting the information out there.
[1:30:57.200 --> 1:31:02.560]  The globalists are fighting around the clock to destroy the family, to destroy heterosexual
[1:31:02.560 --> 1:31:07.160]  relationships, to annihilate our marriages, and the studies are all clear.
[1:31:07.160 --> 1:31:13.600]  The number one cause of marital splits is that there is problems in the bedroom, and the
[1:31:13.600 --> 1:31:17.520]  number one issue men have is erectile dysfunction.
[1:31:17.520 --> 1:31:21.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, the left makes big jokes about this because they don't want people
[1:31:21.160 --> 1:31:25.720]  having lasting, good, loving relationships, they want to break up society, and we are
[1:31:25.720 --> 1:31:32.960]  so excited to have the number one natural male enhancement pill in the world, available
[1:31:32.960 --> 1:31:34.720]  as a major sponsor now.

[1:31:41.560 --> 1:31:44.560]  the science yourself, and then get a bottle of InstaHeart.
[1:31:44.560 --> 1:31:48.520]  It's discreet shipping, I've used it, it's amazing, and it's not just for folks that
[1:31:48.520 --> 1:31:57.240]  have problems in the bedroom, this also enhances it, so again, get yours today at TheIronPatriot.com.
[1:31:57.240 --> 1:32:04.240]  There is nothing, there is no more epitome of free speech than right here, and that's
[1:32:04.240 --> 1:32:08.800]  what people recognize and resonate with, and as Ward said, you're not going to find a
[1:32:08.800 --> 1:32:11.040]  better place for information.
[1:32:11.040 --> 1:32:14.400]  You might not agree with everything, you might not agree with all our perspectives, but we
[1:32:14.400 --> 1:32:18.920]  cover all the information, and there's nowhere else really that does it like we do here,
[1:32:18.920 --> 1:32:20.400]  thank you for that Ward.
[1:32:20.400 --> 1:32:24.680]  InfowarsStore.com, by the way, the products he mentions, InfowarsStore.com is where to
[1:32:24.680 --> 1:32:29.680]  get them folks, and we do have the best supplements, I mean, just like we try our best with our
[1:32:29.680 --> 1:32:36.360]  news coverage and our information, we do the best with our supplements as well, I mean,
[1:32:36.360 --> 1:32:40.280]  look at the hair and beard support formula, folks, this is a joke, I mean, we're giving
[1:32:40.280 --> 1:32:45.120]  this thing away, it's 75% off, by the way, it works for me, in case you haven't noticed,
[1:32:45.120 --> 1:32:52.160]  the hair and beard formula is working for me, quite well, I might add, quite well,
[1:32:52.160 --> 1:32:58.640]  my barber appreciates hair and beard support for men, I go and see him quite often now.
[1:32:58.640 --> 1:33:13.880]  Speaking of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:13.880 --> 1:33:18.680]  We are continuing here today with Gonzalo Lira, I'm Mike Adams, filling in for Alex just
[1:33:18.680 --> 1:33:23.240]  for the next hour or so, and there's been breaking news this morning, we're gonna ask
[1:33:23.240 --> 1:33:29.480]  Mr. Lira to comment on this, from zero heads here, anger from Ukraine's backers after damning
[1:33:29.480 --> 1:33:35.320]  amnesty reports, spotlights, human shields, this is an open admission that Ukraine has
[1:33:35.320 --> 1:33:43.120]  been using civilians as shields for their military operations, causing the unneeded
[1:33:43.120 --> 1:33:48.560]  deaths of many civilians throughout Ukraine, and then often, as we've seen, blaming those
[1:33:48.560 --> 1:33:55.040]  deaths on Russia, when in fact, it was Ukraine's government under Zelensky, that was causing
[1:33:55.040 --> 1:33:57.440]  this violence against their own people.
[1:33:57.440 --> 1:34:02.440]  Mr. Lira, I don't know if you want me to call you Gonzalo or Mr. Lira, or either one, but
[1:34:02.440 --> 1:34:03.440]  your comments.
[1:34:03.440 --> 1:34:09.040]  Yeah, certainly, it's been known since the very beginning of the war that the Zelensky
[1:34:09.040 --> 1:34:12.640]  regime forces have been using civilians as human shields.
[1:34:12.640 --> 1:34:19.320]  They've also been lying about attacks that they themselves have carried out against civilian
[1:34:19.320 --> 1:34:25.120]  targets in Donetsk, and claiming that the Russians did it and whatnot.
[1:34:25.120 --> 1:34:31.720]  You have to understand that the Zelensky regime forces that are in the Donbas, they are an
[1:34:31.720 --> 1:34:39.720]  occupying force, and you like it or not, the fact is that the Russian army is freeing those
[1:34:39.720 --> 1:34:44.160]  people because those people are ethnic Russians, and they have been under the bootheal of the
[1:34:44.160 --> 1:34:47.960]  Zelensky regime and previously the Poroshenko regime.
[1:34:47.960 --> 1:34:54.160]  This goes all the way back to 2014, when the U.S. State Department engineered a coup d'etat
[1:34:54.160 --> 1:34:58.200]  and overthrew the legitimate government of Ukraine, which it had problems.
[1:34:58.200 --> 1:35:02.360]  They weren't saying, I mean, it was kind of corrupt and kind of incompetent, right?
[1:35:02.360 --> 1:35:07.720]  But it was overthrown and Poroshenko was installed and then now Zelensky, and these
[1:35:07.720 --> 1:35:14.240]  people are puppets of the United States of the U.S. State Department, and they are hardcore
[1:35:14.240 --> 1:35:15.560]  Ukraine nationalists.
[1:35:15.560 --> 1:35:21.400]  You have to understand, the country of Ukraine is divided in two.
[1:35:21.400 --> 1:35:28.400]  The western half is ethnic Ukrainian, and the eastern half, roughly speaking, is ethnic
[1:35:28.400 --> 1:35:29.400]  Russian.
[1:35:29.400 --> 1:35:33.920]  Now, they speak Russian, they have family members in Russia, they consider themselves
[1:35:33.920 --> 1:35:35.240]  Russian.
[1:35:35.240 --> 1:35:41.040]  Not everybody, but a large majority on the eastern side of the country.
[1:35:41.040 --> 1:35:45.760]  And so what has happened is that these Zelensky regime forces, they were in the Donbas, which
[1:35:45.760 --> 1:35:51.880]  as you know is in the southeast of the country, and in this area, roughly, they have been
[1:35:51.880 --> 1:35:58.400]  shelling the city of Donetsk for eight years because the city of Donetsk, back in 2014,
[1:35:58.400 --> 1:36:03.000]  did not accept the fact of this American engineered coup d'etat that overthrew the
[1:36:03.000 --> 1:36:11.000]  legitimate government and installed a hypernationalist, one could call them neo-Nazi government.
[1:36:11.000 --> 1:36:17.600]  And this neo-Nazi regime has deliberately tried to expunge Russians from or ethnic Russians
[1:36:17.600 --> 1:36:22.480]  and the Russian language from the country known as Ukraine.
[1:36:22.480 --> 1:36:29.080]  And so you have basically a civil war, and the Zelensky regime forces were an occupying
[1:36:29.080 --> 1:36:33.920]  force, and they committed all kinds of human rights abuses and atrocities.
[1:36:33.920 --> 1:36:38.040]  And more often than not, when they committed these atrocities, they would blame the Russians
[1:36:38.040 --> 1:36:43.760]  and say, oh, the Russians did it, we were innocent, we're good, and it was all a lie,
[1:36:43.760 --> 1:36:48.560]  and what's more important, the Western media knew it was a lie.
[1:36:48.560 --> 1:36:55.520]  The State Department, the Pentagon, the National Security Council, they all knew it was lies,
[1:36:55.520 --> 1:36:59.160]  but it sold the brand, it sold the narrative.
[1:36:59.160 --> 1:37:04.160]  And ultimately, the problem with Ukraine, quite frankly, is that it's this rock that
[1:37:04.160 --> 1:37:08.760]  when you pick it up, all kinds of wriggly things start moving around.
[1:37:08.760 --> 1:37:14.400]  Because the level of corruption, it's not just Hunter Biden who got all kinds of monies.
[1:37:14.400 --> 1:37:21.520]  It's not just the sons of the Scions of other prominent people, like the stepson of John
[1:37:21.520 --> 1:37:24.520]  Kerry, Nancy Pelosi's sons.
[1:37:24.520 --> 1:37:27.800]  They were all involved in Ukraine to one extent or the other.
[1:37:27.800 --> 1:37:34.800]  The problem is that, see, there's so much dirt in Ukraine, that it splatters everybody.
[1:37:34.800 --> 1:37:39.520]  And so that's why they want to maintain this narrative that Zelensky good, Zelensky is
[1:37:39.520 --> 1:37:46.200]  a saint, and the fact that now the regime, the Biden regime, is allowing criticisms
[1:37:46.200 --> 1:37:48.920]  of Zelensky to emerge.
[1:37:48.920 --> 1:37:54.960]  It signals that something that Zelensky is slowly but surely falling out of favor a couple
[1:37:54.960 --> 1:37:55.960]  of weeks ago.
[1:37:55.960 --> 1:37:56.960]  Well, this is shocking.
[1:37:56.960 --> 1:38:00.280]  I'm sorry to interrupt, but this is absolutely key.
[1:38:00.280 --> 1:38:05.680]  When you have amnesty international now condemning the Zelensky regime and their tactics that
[1:38:05.680 --> 1:38:10.360]  are resulting in the unnecessary deaths of civilians, this is a major turning point.
[1:38:10.360 --> 1:38:12.120]  And I'm really glad you're speaking to that.
[1:38:12.120 --> 1:38:20.720]  And I asked you more about that, but think about the truth here, excuse me, the Western
[1:38:20.720 --> 1:38:27.240]  media has said that Zelensky is an angel and can do no wrong, and yet his regime has banned
[1:38:27.240 --> 1:38:29.240]  opposition political parties.
[1:38:29.240 --> 1:38:35.200]  They have, in effect, criminalized the independent media or any opposition media in the country,
[1:38:35.200 --> 1:38:41.600]  and even worse, on an anti-humanitarian level, they have banned Russian literature, Russian
[1:38:41.600 --> 1:38:43.520]  theater, Russian art.
[1:38:43.520 --> 1:38:47.040]  You can't read Tolstoy or listen to Tchaikovsky, right?
[1:38:47.040 --> 1:38:48.040]  Go ahead.
[1:38:48.040 --> 1:38:49.040]  I'm sorry.
[1:38:49.040 --> 1:38:50.040]  No, no, no.
[1:38:50.040 --> 1:38:55.560]  Look, the Zelensky regime is as far from democratic as you can possibly get.
[1:38:55.560 --> 1:38:58.440]  The Zelensky regime is supported by a bunch of neo-Nazis.
[1:38:58.440 --> 1:39:03.920]  And everybody says, especially in the Biden regime or the mouthpieces of the Biden regime,
[1:39:03.920 --> 1:39:08.520]  the mainstream media, they say, how could it be possible that Nazis are part of the Zelensky
[1:39:08.520 --> 1:39:09.520]  regime?
[1:39:09.520 --> 1:39:10.520]  Zelensky is Jewish.
[1:39:10.520 --> 1:39:13.280]  It doesn't matter, because they are.
[1:39:13.280 --> 1:39:17.880]  Groups like right sector is a battalion that is no longer with us.
[1:39:17.880 --> 1:39:23.000]  There are a whole bunch, a whole hodgepodge of these neo-Nazi groups that support the
[1:39:23.000 --> 1:39:24.120]  Zelensky regime.
[1:39:24.120 --> 1:39:28.720]  Now, a real turning point that happened about two weeks ago, which was shocking to everybody
[1:39:28.720 --> 1:39:33.320]  who is involved in this, is that Jake Sullivan, in some interview somewhere, I think it was
[1:39:33.320 --> 1:39:38.880]  the Aspen Institute, but don't quote me on that, and he said that he was very concerned
[1:39:38.880 --> 1:39:44.320]  about the personal safety of Zelensky.
[1:39:44.320 --> 1:39:49.080]  And that was a huge signal, because you see, the Russians have no intention of harming
[1:39:49.080 --> 1:39:51.720]  Zelensky for a very simple reason.
[1:39:51.720 --> 1:39:56.320]  This has been known since the beginning, because Zelensky has been propped up so much.
[1:39:56.320 --> 1:40:01.040]  He's been glorified as the new Winston Churchill by everybody in the Western mainstream media
[1:40:01.040 --> 1:40:05.520]  that at this time, he is considered the legitimate leader of Ukraine.
[1:40:05.520 --> 1:40:10.800]  And so Russia realizes that eventually this war will end one way or the other, and they
[1:40:10.800 --> 1:40:14.200]  are going to have to sign a ceasefire deal.
[1:40:14.200 --> 1:40:15.200]  And so what do they want?
[1:40:15.200 --> 1:40:17.840]  They want to sign a ceasefire deal with Zelensky.
[1:40:17.840 --> 1:40:23.280]  They need to keep him alive, because if Zelensky is the one who signs the ceasefire agreement,
[1:40:23.280 --> 1:40:30.800]  it'll be politically much stronger, and therefore it will probably diminish the amount of insurgency,
[1:40:30.800 --> 1:40:36.920]  terrorist attacks, and whatnot in the period after the end of this special military operation.
[1:40:36.920 --> 1:40:38.880]  That's the rationale of the Russians.
[1:40:38.880 --> 1:40:42.040]  And they've been fairly clear as to why they're leaving him alive.
[1:40:42.040 --> 1:40:46.080]  If they wanted to kill Zelensky, they could have done it on the first day of the special
[1:40:46.080 --> 1:40:47.080]  military operation.
[1:40:47.080 --> 1:40:52.760]  They've always known where he is, roughly, to send a few missiles to get him, no problem.
[1:40:52.760 --> 1:40:59.920]  But the fact that Jake Sullivan all of a sudden says that Zelensky's life might be in danger,
[1:40:59.920 --> 1:41:01.560]  they always project.
[1:41:01.560 --> 1:41:02.560]  That's the thing.
[1:41:02.560 --> 1:41:07.520]  They always project their own intentions onto their opponent, in this case the Russian.
[1:41:07.520 --> 1:41:13.680]  They have the intention of knocking off Zelensky because he is outliving his usefulness to
[1:41:13.680 --> 1:41:17.400]  the Biden regime, and that's what's happening.
[1:41:17.400 --> 1:41:21.280]  Now do I think that something will happen to Zelensky?
[1:41:21.280 --> 1:41:25.200]  You read the tea leaves and you start to think that maybe what would be the odds?
[1:41:25.200 --> 1:41:33.040]  I'd say maybe 40% that they bump him off because the Sullivan and now Amnesty M International,
[1:41:33.040 --> 1:41:36.720]  all of this is telling us that he is falling out of favor.
[1:41:36.720 --> 1:41:38.240]  So what happens next?
[1:41:38.240 --> 1:41:39.240]  We'll see.
[1:41:39.240 --> 1:41:40.240]  Okay.
[1:41:40.240 --> 1:41:41.240]  Again, I'm sorry to interrupt.
[1:41:41.240 --> 1:41:46.640]  This is just a slight delay, but how much of what's going on right now with the West
[1:41:46.640 --> 1:41:53.240]  pushing Ukraine to do this, how much of this, in your opinion, involves the attempted cover-up
[1:41:53.240 --> 1:42:00.600]  of the West's biological weapons facilities in Ukraine and, of course, the kickbacks,
[1:42:00.600 --> 1:42:06.680]  the financial, the money laundering to the Biden regime, and other people throughout
[1:42:06.680 --> 1:42:11.080]  perhaps the State Department or wherever that money flows, how much of that do you think
[1:42:11.080 --> 1:42:18.600]  is responsible for this insane policy of just endlessly killing the Ukrainian men, sadly?
[1:42:18.600 --> 1:42:20.920]  Yeah, a good chunk.
[1:42:20.920 --> 1:42:26.880]  A good chunk and I would say that, see, you can't measure it by percentages because there
[1:42:26.880 --> 1:42:31.080]  are multiple motivations that are driving this shit forward, okay?
[1:42:31.080 --> 1:42:33.240]  But is it an important piece?
[1:42:33.240 --> 1:42:37.200]  Most definitely because they don't want that documentation out there because if it goes
[1:42:37.200 --> 1:42:40.840]  out there, it becomes a huge embarrassment to the Biden regime.
[1:42:40.840 --> 1:42:44.800]  And China can start showing this and say, look at what the Americans are doing.
[1:42:44.800 --> 1:42:45.800]  You kept blaming us.
[1:42:45.800 --> 1:42:47.040]  Gonzalez, we're going to have to go to break.
[1:42:47.040 --> 1:42:48.200]  I apologize.
[1:42:48.200 --> 1:42:50.840]  Please stay with us, a lot more questions on the other side.
[1:42:50.840 --> 1:42:52.560]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[1:42:52.560 --> 1:42:57.000]  I'm Mike Adams with Gonzalo, and Lira will be right back after this break.
[1:42:57.000 --> 1:43:21.080]  I'm Mike Adams with Gonzalo, and Lira will be right back after this break.
[1:43:21.080 --> 1:43:37.960]  I'm Mike Adams with Gonzalo, and Lira will be right back after this break.
[1:43:37.960 --> 1:43:50.960]  I'm Mike Adams with Gonzalo, and Lira will be right back after this break.
[1:43:50.960 --> 1:43:52.360]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[1:43:52.360 --> 1:43:57.080]  I'll spread the word, my friends, we're involved in an epic historic battle.
[1:43:57.080 --> 1:44:02.120]  Seven months ago, in December of 2021, we launched the first in the three-coin founding
[1:44:02.120 --> 1:44:05.840]  member series, George Washington Slaying the Dragon.
[1:44:05.840 --> 1:44:09.640]  Then we launched the Tree of Liberty coin, and finally, the Second Amendment comment
[1:44:09.640 --> 1:44:11.640]  taken Molan Labe coin.
[1:44:11.640 --> 1:44:22.440]  There are only 75 coins left in the three-coin series, exclusively right now at 1776point.com.
[1:44:22.440 --> 1:44:27.200]  For the final 75 people to become founding members for this big project we're launching
[1:44:27.200 --> 1:44:32.680]  in the near future, you'll also get a personal signed piece of art I made of the sheepdog
[1:44:32.680 --> 1:44:34.600]  chasing the wolf in a personal message.
[1:44:34.600 --> 1:44:41.360]  It's your last chance to get all three coins at 1776point.com.
[1:44:41.360 --> 1:44:43.680]  This is history happening now.
[1:44:43.680 --> 1:44:49.600]  Info War Station support is changing the world, and this is the final 75 three-coin
[1:44:49.600 --> 1:44:56.760]  set exclusively available at 1776point.com.
[1:44:56.760 --> 1:45:00.840]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria, or a pump gas, or whether you're a farmer,
[1:45:00.840 --> 1:45:05.800]  a rancher, a doctor, a lawyer, or a millionaire, Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these
[1:45:05.800 --> 1:45:06.800]  profiles.
[1:45:06.800 --> 1:45:07.800]  You see it every year.
[1:45:07.800 --> 1:45:09.800]  30 different tax returns, 30 different answers.
[1:45:09.800 --> 1:45:12.680]  50 different tax returns, 50 different answers.
[1:45:12.680 --> 1:45:18.280]  And almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms and the big tax groups,
[1:45:18.280 --> 1:45:21.880]  because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public understanding
[1:45:21.880 --> 1:45:22.880]  this and knowing this.
[1:45:22.880 --> 1:45:28.520]  So it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody
[1:45:28.520 --> 1:45:33.760]  to be able to do things tax-wise that's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more of
[1:45:33.760 --> 1:45:34.760]  your money.
[1:45:34.760 --> 1:45:39.520]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.
[1:45:39.520 --> 1:45:46.520]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL, jonestaxrelief.com, one word, jonestaxrelief.com,
[1:45:46.520 --> 1:45:53.000]  or call 833-904-285, 833-904-285.
[1:45:53.000 --> 1:46:00.400]  If you're like myself and so many other people on this planet, especially as you get older,
[1:46:00.400 --> 1:46:02.400]  you gain weight, even if you eat a lot less.
[1:46:02.400 --> 1:46:07.160]  I've got to tell you, Info Wars is only about bringing you amazing products that really
[1:46:07.160 --> 1:46:08.160]  work.
[1:46:08.160 --> 1:46:11.680]  So we looked at the supplement market that we fund a lot of our operations with and we
[1:46:11.680 --> 1:46:18.160]  said, what are the best-selling natural, healthy, anti-fat weight loss products that are out
[1:46:18.160 --> 1:46:19.160]  there?
[1:46:19.160 --> 1:46:23.720]  We went and looked at the top 10 and they all had the same ingredients in common that

[1:47:05.640 --> 1:47:22.080]  We're continuing our interview with Gonzalo Lira from Kharkov, Ukraine.
[1:47:22.080 --> 1:47:26.320]  And I'm Mike Adams, you're on The Alex Jones Show, Alex will rejoin us in roughly about
[1:47:26.320 --> 1:47:28.320]  another hour or so.
[1:47:28.320 --> 1:47:34.760]  It is quite an extraordinary day with, I mean you have this self-destruction or let's
[1:47:34.760 --> 1:47:39.600]  call it a controlled demolition of the judicial system in America, the way they're railroading
[1:47:39.600 --> 1:47:45.280]  Alex Jones and denying him the right to testify in his own defense, denying his lawyers the
[1:47:45.280 --> 1:47:47.520]  right to present evidence in their own defense.
[1:47:47.520 --> 1:47:53.320]  And since we are talking about Russia and Ukraine today, we have to just point out that
[1:47:53.320 --> 1:47:58.800]  this starts to feel like the old Soviet Union right here in Austin, Texas right now with
[1:47:58.800 --> 1:48:01.520]  what's going on in the court system.
[1:48:01.520 --> 1:48:07.280]  And I've even heard of many sort of Western analysts and commentators saying that they
[1:48:07.280 --> 1:48:13.200]  experience greater levels of free speech in Russia than they do in the United States right
[1:48:13.200 --> 1:48:14.200]  now.
[1:48:14.200 --> 1:48:18.640]  So Mr. Lira is our guest, Gonzalo, thank you for joining us again and what are your comments
[1:48:18.640 --> 1:48:19.640]  on that?
[1:48:19.640 --> 1:48:24.640]  I mean do people going to Russia to speak more freely today than in America?
[1:48:24.640 --> 1:48:31.880]  Yeah, well like for instance you have Russia Today which is a news organization sponsored
[1:48:31.880 --> 1:48:33.400]  by the Russian government.
[1:48:33.400 --> 1:48:38.840]  But you certainly are able to talk about things in a much more free environment there than
[1:48:38.840 --> 1:48:44.440]  you would see in any of the mainstream media outlets in the United States or in the West.
[1:48:44.440 --> 1:48:49.800]  And like for instance, today as a matter of fact, James Lindsay, the he of the famous
[1:48:49.800 --> 1:48:55.040]  hoax papers, you know the critical race theory hoax papers that was like a big laugh that
[1:48:55.040 --> 1:49:01.480]  we all had a few years ago, well he got the platform from Twitter for just pointing out
[1:49:01.480 --> 1:49:11.080]  the fact that so many of these, you know, the drag story time hour and what not are
[1:49:11.080 --> 1:49:13.640]  basically grooming events.
[1:49:13.640 --> 1:49:18.000]  He was pointing this out and because he's pointing out something that is true, he is
[1:49:18.000 --> 1:49:22.280]  silenced and that's the basic problem that we're having in so far as free speech is
[1:49:22.280 --> 1:49:23.280]  concerned.
[1:49:23.280 --> 1:49:29.240]  You see, there is a difference between reality and the speech you use to describe reality,
[1:49:29.240 --> 1:49:30.240]  right?
[1:49:30.240 --> 1:49:34.000]  Because one is the actual thing and the other is the words that you use to describe the
[1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:35.000]  thing.
[1:49:35.000 --> 1:49:40.920]  And see what happens is that the regime in the West, the Biden regime, this neoliberal
[1:49:40.920 --> 1:49:46.160]  order that we have, they seem to think that if they can silence the speech describing
[1:49:46.160 --> 1:49:50.560]  some reality, then they don't have to worry about that reality anymore.
[1:49:50.560 --> 1:49:52.000]  This is Orwellian.
[1:49:52.000 --> 1:49:56.600]  This is a notion that just because somebody cannot articulate something, then that thing
[1:49:56.600 --> 1:49:58.800]  does not exist.
[1:49:58.800 --> 1:50:04.120]  It's creepy, it's anti-American, quite frankly.
[1:50:04.120 --> 1:50:08.440]  It goes against everything that the United States is supposed to stand for and it is
[1:50:08.440 --> 1:50:09.440]  very true.
[1:50:09.440 --> 1:50:14.240]  In Russia, you have more freedom of speech than you have in the United States or in
[1:50:14.240 --> 1:50:16.640]  Western Europe, Western Europe, it's even worse.
[1:50:16.640 --> 1:50:24.400]  You have people in the United Kingdom being arrested for posting a meme on Facebook.
[1:50:24.400 --> 1:50:30.200]  We saw it a couple of days ago, Lawrence Fox, the former actor who's become an activist.
[1:50:30.200 --> 1:50:31.200]  He filmed it.
[1:50:31.200 --> 1:50:38.880]  He showed how a British army veterans were being arrested for having posted memes on
[1:50:38.880 --> 1:50:47.520]  Facebook because it seems that it offended somebody, offending somebody is now a crime.
[1:50:47.520 --> 1:50:48.520]  That's crazy.
[1:50:48.520 --> 1:50:49.520]  That's absurd.
[1:50:49.520 --> 1:50:54.480]  It's completely absurd, but let me ask you to provide some context to this conversation
[1:50:54.480 --> 1:50:58.920]  though as well because what we are saying here together is rather extraordinary and
[1:50:58.920 --> 1:51:04.480]  I want the audience to be clear that you can answer for yourself, but let me ask you, are
[1:51:04.480 --> 1:51:09.680]  you seeking favor with Putin, are you trying to get residency in Russia, are you a Russian
[1:51:09.680 --> 1:51:10.680]  puppet?
[1:51:10.680 --> 1:51:11.680]  No.
[1:51:11.680 --> 1:51:12.680]  I know, I'm not.
[1:51:12.680 --> 1:51:13.680]  I love America.
[1:51:13.680 --> 1:51:14.680]  I'm a Texan.
[1:51:14.680 --> 1:51:19.320]  I'm 100 percent, let's have the Constitution and the Bill of Rights and free speech and
[1:51:19.320 --> 1:51:20.320]  all of that.
[1:51:20.320 --> 1:51:21.320]  What about you, Gonzalo?
[1:51:21.320 --> 1:51:22.320]  Yeah.
[1:51:22.320 --> 1:51:27.480]  Look, I just call them like I see them because I learned early on that it's so much easier
[1:51:27.480 --> 1:51:31.240]  to tell the truth because then you don't have to remember anything, you just say the
[1:51:31.240 --> 1:51:32.240]  truth.
[1:51:32.240 --> 1:51:38.560]  I learned my lesson when I was a kid, just one of those escapades when I was in fifth
[1:51:38.560 --> 1:51:39.560]  grade.
[1:51:39.560 --> 1:51:44.840]  I got a bad report card, I lied about it and oh God, it was like a whole nightmare and finally
[1:51:44.840 --> 1:51:48.200]  after that, that was a lesson learned and never again, just tell the truth.
[1:51:48.200 --> 1:51:52.360]  You have less to remember, you never have to worry about getting tripped up.
[1:51:52.360 --> 1:51:55.680]  These people, of course, they lie with every breath that they take.
[1:51:55.680 --> 1:51:59.000]  When they say hello, it's probably a lie.
[1:51:59.000 --> 1:52:00.680]  That's the way these people are.
[1:52:00.680 --> 1:52:07.400]  The thing is, the question becomes how long are the American people going to take this
[1:52:07.400 --> 1:52:12.400]  situation because the leadership class that we have in the West does not care about the
[1:52:12.400 --> 1:52:13.400]  people.
[1:52:13.400 --> 1:52:15.120]  In fact, they look at the people with contempt.
[1:52:15.120 --> 1:52:20.360]  They look at the people like how's to be milked and then slaughtered.
[1:52:20.360 --> 1:52:25.440]  That is just not what we want in a leadership, let alone in a democratic leadership.
[1:52:25.440 --> 1:52:29.320]  I was talking about this yesterday as a matter of fact.
[1:52:29.320 --> 1:52:32.960]  On my YouTube channel, I have a live stream show called The Roundtable.
[1:52:32.960 --> 1:52:36.640]  I try to bring on good guests and it's often a lot of fun.
[1:52:36.640 --> 1:52:41.960]  I was talking to the guest that I had last night and I was saying, and this is true,
[1:52:41.960 --> 1:52:46.200]  you see in China, the leadership, you can say that it's not democratic, that the Communist
[1:52:46.200 --> 1:52:50.920]  Party of China is a communist regime, which it is.
[1:52:50.920 --> 1:52:56.320]  You can say that Vladimir Putin is a dictator or this or that or the election that put him
[1:52:56.320 --> 1:52:58.160]  into power was not on the up and up.
[1:52:58.160 --> 1:53:04.080]  You can say whatever you want, but the thing is, see what's key is that Xi Jinping in China
[1:53:04.080 --> 1:53:12.040]  and Vladimir Putin in Russia, the people in the leadership class in China, the people
[1:53:12.040 --> 1:53:18.400]  in the Kremlin in Russia, they actually care about their own people because they come from
[1:53:18.400 --> 1:53:21.000]  there.
[1:53:21.000 --> 1:53:25.600]  They feel that they have a responsibility to the people and in some cases they are actually
[1:53:25.600 --> 1:53:30.080]  scared of their own people because they know if they screw it up, their own people will
[1:53:30.080 --> 1:53:32.080]  rise up.
[1:53:32.080 --> 1:53:37.160]  You have to understand that in China, in Russia, you can say that they're not democratic
[1:53:37.160 --> 1:53:43.160]  like in the West, but you have a leadership class that actually cares about the good opinion
[1:53:43.160 --> 1:53:48.400]  of their own people, actually cares about improving the lives of their own people.
[1:53:48.400 --> 1:53:52.560]  The Chinese Communist Party, whatever you might think of them, they have delivered to
[1:53:52.560 --> 1:53:57.440]  the Chinese people and improved their lives with infrastructure, with different programs
[1:53:57.440 --> 1:54:03.240]  to build all kinds of high-speed rails, all kinds of electrical installations and whatnot.
[1:54:03.240 --> 1:54:06.960]  The leadership class in the West does not care about the people.
[1:54:06.960 --> 1:54:11.520]  The leadership class in the West only cares about maintaining its own privilege, its
[1:54:11.520 --> 1:54:12.600]  own status.
[1:54:12.600 --> 1:54:18.000]  They only care about the opinions of the other people in their little set.
[1:54:18.000 --> 1:54:23.640]  In their little group, they all smile and nod and do all these stupid virtue signaling
[1:54:23.640 --> 1:54:24.640]  nonsense.
[1:54:24.640 --> 1:54:29.520]  But they don't care about the people, and that's the thing that drives me up the wall
[1:54:29.520 --> 1:54:36.360]  because they could care less if all the American people, all of the people of Europe die for
[1:54:36.360 --> 1:54:39.960]  some pointless war so long as they maintain their position.
[1:54:39.960 --> 1:54:41.840]  They look at people like...
[1:54:41.840 --> 1:54:47.480]  But Gonzalo, let's extend this conversation to Western Europe now.
[1:54:47.480 --> 1:54:49.280]  And I want to revisit China.
[1:54:49.280 --> 1:54:51.640]  I might disagree with you slightly on that point.
[1:54:51.640 --> 1:54:58.240]  I feel like the leaders of China are willing to sacrifice their people and they will use
[1:54:58.240 --> 1:55:05.160]  all kinds of authoritarian methods to control them and repress them to prevent the uprising.
[1:55:05.160 --> 1:55:10.640]  But I also see your point where the West cares absolutely nothing about their own people.
[1:55:10.640 --> 1:55:13.040]  I absolutely see what you're saying there.
[1:55:13.040 --> 1:55:15.040]  Maybe this is a universal thing.
[1:55:15.040 --> 1:55:17.680]  Very few governments actually care about any of their people.
[1:55:17.680 --> 1:55:21.280]  But the West in particular is on a suicide mission right now.
[1:55:21.280 --> 1:55:27.560]  So let's talk about Germany in particular and these economic sanctions against Russia.
[1:55:27.560 --> 1:55:32.620]  I'd like you to describe what you think is coming for the people of Germany this coming
[1:55:32.620 --> 1:55:39.240]  winter in terms of food, heat, fuel, industry.
[1:55:39.240 --> 1:55:42.280]  Are they going to see uprisings or will it be too cold and too many people are freezing
[1:55:42.280 --> 1:55:44.280]  to even be able to do that?
[1:55:44.280 --> 1:55:47.520]  They're not going to see any heating, they're not going to see food, and they're not going
[1:55:47.520 --> 1:55:48.520]  to see industry.
[1:55:48.520 --> 1:55:49.520]  They're screwed.
[1:55:49.520 --> 1:55:50.520]  Okay.
[1:55:50.520 --> 1:55:52.480]  Forget about it.
[1:55:52.480 --> 1:55:55.640]  Even if they were able to make nice with Russia, which will never happen because the
[1:55:55.640 --> 1:55:58.920]  Russians now no longer trust the Europeans.
[1:55:58.920 --> 1:56:03.960]  And what's key here is that because of the sanctions, say the Europeans went on this
[1:56:03.960 --> 1:56:10.000]  weird Russophobic rant where they said that everything Russia was bad, you know, some
[1:56:10.000 --> 1:56:14.520]  tennis players, you know, they get sanctioned and they can't play, you know, and they get
[1:56:14.520 --> 1:56:15.520]  insulted and all the rest of it.
[1:56:15.520 --> 1:56:16.520]  Tennis players.
[1:56:16.520 --> 1:56:20.360]  I mean, come on, whatever you might think of Putin and the special military operation,
[1:56:20.360 --> 1:56:23.720]  some random tennis player doesn't have anything to do with this, right?
[1:56:23.720 --> 1:56:30.920]  You know, all kinds of Russophobic attitudes from a continent that is supposed to be all
[1:56:30.920 --> 1:56:37.040]  about liberal values, about tolerance, about accepting people as they are and not assigning
[1:56:37.040 --> 1:56:39.000]  collective guilt.
[1:56:39.000 --> 1:56:40.520]  And that's the key issue.
[1:56:40.520 --> 1:56:45.280]  See, the Europeans showed themselves to be complete hypocrites.
[1:56:45.280 --> 1:56:47.040]  This has been shocking to the Russians.
[1:56:47.040 --> 1:56:53.200]  I keep in touch with people in Russia, both Russians as well as expats living in Russia.
[1:56:53.200 --> 1:56:57.720]  And they tell me that the intellectual classes, the intelligentsia, the upper middle class
[1:56:57.720 --> 1:57:02.280]  people, the people who travel to Europe, who care about the good opinion of Europe, who
[1:57:02.280 --> 1:57:07.480]  want to send their kid to do a little college in Europe or the United States, right?
[1:57:07.480 --> 1:57:08.880]  They're shocked.
[1:57:08.880 --> 1:57:10.200]  They can't believe it.
[1:57:10.200 --> 1:57:14.600]  And you see, Putin for the last 20 years has been telling the people, look, they really
[1:57:14.600 --> 1:57:15.920]  hate your guts.
[1:57:15.920 --> 1:57:19.000]  The Europeans and the Americans, they really do hate your guts.
[1:57:19.000 --> 1:57:23.760]  And all of a sudden, this very influential class of people in Russia, the intellectual
[1:57:23.760 --> 1:57:28.240]  classes, call it like the top 20%, you know, the managerial elite, right?
[1:57:28.240 --> 1:57:29.240]  The educated class.
[1:57:29.240 --> 1:57:31.240]  Gonzalo, I apologize again.
[1:57:31.240 --> 1:57:33.400]  We're going to go to a short break, but I understand what you're saying.
[1:57:33.400 --> 1:57:37.000]  They're finally realizing the West doesn't love them.
[1:57:37.000 --> 1:57:41.440]  So we'll be back with Gonzalo Lira stay with us as we enter the third hour of the Alex
[1:57:41.440 --> 1:57:42.440]  Jones show.
[1:57:42.440 --> 1:57:43.440]  We'll be right back.
[1:57:43.440 --> 1:57:50.800]  You say Alex Jones crazy, he's a conspiracy theory guy, he's a nutcase, he's got these
[1:57:50.800 --> 1:57:53.520]  rants and all that.
[1:57:53.520 --> 1:58:00.200]  What they miss is that this guy's ahead of the curve on so many different topics of signal,
[1:58:00.200 --> 1:58:01.200]  not noise.
[1:58:01.200 --> 1:58:09.200]  And you compare that to PBS and NPR and BBC and we'll do what Alex Jones put out there
[1:58:09.200 --> 1:58:12.760]  versus what your collective body has put out there.
[1:58:12.760 --> 1:58:16.240]  And if you're a sent in a human being and just watching it, you say, well, Alex Jones
[1:58:16.240 --> 1:58:17.240]  is the head of this.
[1:58:17.240 --> 1:58:18.240]  Not only that, he kind of explained it.
[1:58:18.240 --> 1:58:21.640]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[1:58:21.640 --> 1:58:22.640]  That is very rare.
[1:58:22.640 --> 1:58:27.560]  You've got to go back almost to the revolutionary generation and see that in this new book.
[1:58:27.560 --> 1:58:30.920]  I got to tell you, when Tony Lyons first approached me, I read this thing, I go, this
[1:58:30.920 --> 1:58:31.920]  is it.
[1:58:31.920 --> 1:58:32.920]  This is no beetry.
[1:58:32.920 --> 1:58:36.240]  You're not going to be flipping pages or you're going to be having a pin out and you're going
[1:58:36.240 --> 1:58:37.240]  to be underlying stuff.
[1:58:37.240 --> 1:58:40.640]  The Great Reset by Alex Jones.
[1:58:40.640 --> 1:58:46.680]  Order your copy now at Amazon or infowarstore.com.
[1:58:46.680 --> 1:58:47.680]  Infowars has been vindicated.
[1:58:47.680 --> 1:58:49.840]  We've been proven right.
[1:58:49.840 --> 1:58:52.480]  World government, the New World Order is out of the open.
[1:58:52.480 --> 1:58:58.440]  And now more than ever, the forces of Satan are trying to shut down this broadcast.
[1:58:58.440 --> 1:59:02.880]  The forces of anti-human, Godless New World Order are out of control.
[1:59:02.880 --> 1:59:07.000]  So now realize, we have pushed them out in the light, we have pushed them out in the
[1:59:07.000 --> 1:59:09.880]  open and they are so upset and they are so scared.
[1:59:09.880 --> 1:59:13.760]  So while you still can, because any day can be our last broadcast, spread the word about
[1:59:13.760 --> 1:59:18.520]  the show, share the article, share the videos, and please fund us while getting great products
[1:59:18.520 --> 1:59:21.680]  at the same time at infowarstore.com.

[1:59:27.240 --> 1:59:28.240]  formula.

[1:59:39.400 --> 1:59:40.400]  and justice to win.
[1:59:40.400 --> 1:59:42.000]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[1:59:42.000 --> 1:59:48.120]  I'll spread the word, my friends, we're involved in an epic, historic battle.
[1:59:48.120 --> 1:59:58.960]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:59:58.960 --> 2:00:09.200]  All right, folks, welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:09.200 --> 2:00:14.200]  This is the third hour of an extraordinary day and we have an extraordinary guest with
[2:00:14.200 --> 2:00:20.760]  us right now, Gonzalo Lira from Kharkov, Ukraine, and we're going to continue our discussion
[2:00:20.760 --> 2:00:25.760]  about the suicide of Western civilization, really, not just Western Europe, but all of
[2:00:25.760 --> 2:00:26.880]  Western civilization.
[2:00:26.880 --> 2:00:31.280]  I'm Mike Adams and I'm just sitting in for a short amount of time here.
[2:00:31.280 --> 2:00:33.000]  Alex is going to be back shortly.
[2:00:33.000 --> 2:00:34.000]  He's here.
[2:00:34.000 --> 2:00:35.000]  He's in the building somewhere.
[2:00:35.000 --> 2:00:36.720]  I just saw him a minute ago.
[2:00:36.720 --> 2:00:37.720]  So he's here.
[2:00:37.720 --> 2:00:38.720]  He's coming back.
[2:00:38.720 --> 2:00:43.400]  It's his show and he's always got big breaking news, but I want to say something here in
[2:00:43.400 --> 2:00:51.000]  this and then ask for Gonzalo's assessment of this, the Ukraine situation is being a
[2:00:51.000 --> 2:00:57.840]  little bit sidelined in the media because of the China-Taiwan situation and China is
[2:00:57.840 --> 2:01:00.000]  a communist regime.
[2:01:00.000 --> 2:01:07.360]  In my opinion, the CCP is a world bully, but then again, so is the Pentagon.
[2:01:07.360 --> 2:01:11.600]  So is the United States under this illegitimate regime of Joe Biden.
[2:01:11.600 --> 2:01:14.040]  So they're a bully.
[2:01:14.040 --> 2:01:18.640]  Our illegitimate people are bullies too and not real America.
[2:01:18.640 --> 2:01:24.440]  If we had real Americans, if we honor the real outcome of the election in 2020, we wouldn't
[2:01:24.440 --> 2:01:29.120]  be a bully on the world stage as much, although there's still remnants in the State Department
[2:01:29.120 --> 2:01:34.240]  that can't help themselves, but China is a big bully on the world stage.
[2:01:34.240 --> 2:01:40.240]  And I just want to say, in my opinion here on the record, I absolutely support Taiwan's
[2:01:40.240 --> 2:01:41.240]  independence.
[2:01:41.240 --> 2:01:46.480]  I used to live in Taiwan, you know, I speak a fair amount of Mandarin Chinese, I actually
[2:01:46.480 --> 2:01:54.280]  lived in Taipei, Xinilu was the street I lived on and what I witnessed during those
[2:01:54.280 --> 2:01:59.480]  two years that I lived in Taiwan, it's clearly a country that has its own president, current
[2:01:59.480 --> 2:02:04.360]  president is a woman, Tsai Ing-wen is her name, they have their own elections, they
[2:02:04.360 --> 2:02:09.560]  have their own currency, they have their own dialect, Taiwanese, they have their own economy,
[2:02:09.560 --> 2:02:13.760]  they have their own culture, and the Taiwan people really might describe them as a liberal
[2:02:13.760 --> 2:02:19.560]  democracy, they value freedom of speech, they do not want to become communists, and they
[2:02:19.560 --> 2:02:22.560]  also have their own diplomatic relations with other countries around the world, although
[2:02:22.560 --> 2:02:28.040]  China is always trying to crush those diplomatic relations and crush Taiwan as an independent
[2:02:28.040 --> 2:02:29.040]  nation.
[2:02:29.040 --> 2:02:36.160]  So, I just want to say, I believe every nation in the world has the right to its own sovereignty,
[2:02:36.160 --> 2:02:40.280]  every group of people, Taiwan is clearly an independent nation, in my view, and I lived
[2:02:40.280 --> 2:02:45.280]  there and I spoke to those people, so I support Taiwan's independence and I do not support
[2:02:45.280 --> 2:02:50.400]  one China policy, but that doesn't necessarily reflect the opinion of Info Wars or Gonzalo
[2:02:50.400 --> 2:02:53.280]  or anyone else, but that's my take on it.
[2:02:53.280 --> 2:02:59.720]  Now, Mr. Lyra, what do you think about what's happening with China and Taiwan and China threatening
[2:02:59.720 --> 2:03:03.320]  Taiwan with forced reunification, what's your take on it?
[2:03:03.320 --> 2:03:10.400]  My thinking is, if you see a dog that's sleeping, let it lie, simple as that.
[2:03:10.400 --> 2:03:14.800]  It seems to me that the United States is going out of its way to provoke China, and the reason
[2:03:14.800 --> 2:03:16.360]  is very cynical.
[2:03:16.360 --> 2:03:20.600]  The reason is because the American economy is collapsing and the Biden administration
[2:03:20.600 --> 2:03:28.640]  wants something that will cover it up, that will fill the news paper headlines with stories
[2:03:28.640 --> 2:03:34.200]  of something going on in China, they tried to do it with Ukraine, they wanted a Cinderella
[2:03:34.200 --> 2:03:39.440]  story of Ukraine bravely fighting off the Russians and the Russians suffering an ignomious
[2:03:39.440 --> 2:03:42.480]  defeat, and that scenario is just not playing out.
[2:03:42.480 --> 2:03:47.200]  On the contrary, the Russian economy, because of the sanctions, the Russian economy is getting
[2:03:47.200 --> 2:03:52.320]  stronger, not weaker, it's getting a lot stronger because they increased their revenue because
[2:03:52.320 --> 2:03:58.960]  of greater oil sales, the greater price of oil and greater price of gas.
[2:03:58.960 --> 2:04:04.960]  On the other hand, because Europe cut them off completely in so far as trade, the Russians
[2:04:04.960 --> 2:04:08.480]  are getting money from overseas, but they have nowhere to spend it.
[2:04:08.480 --> 2:04:11.040]  So what are they doing with all this cash?
[2:04:11.040 --> 2:04:17.240]  They're spending it domestically in Russia, improving their own country, and once they
[2:04:17.240 --> 2:04:21.560]  start to annex the parts of Ukraine that they have conquered, they're going to put hell
[2:04:21.560 --> 2:04:24.760]  of a lot of money into Ukraine.
[2:04:24.760 --> 2:04:27.240]  They are improving their own country.
[2:04:27.240 --> 2:04:30.120]  This has been a bonanza for the Russians.
[2:04:30.120 --> 2:04:34.200]  Insofar as China is concerned, why provoke the Chinese?
[2:04:34.200 --> 2:04:35.200]  What purpose?
[2:04:35.200 --> 2:04:42.200]  It was just to deflect, to distract people from the collapsing American economy.
[2:04:42.200 --> 2:04:43.200]  Exactly right.
[2:04:43.200 --> 2:04:48.120]  This is a Pelosi and what's going on is provoking the Chinese absolutely, and that doesn't need
[2:04:48.120 --> 2:04:49.120]  to happen.
[2:04:49.120 --> 2:04:50.120]  We're going to take a one minute break.
[2:04:50.120 --> 2:04:53.800]  We'll be right back and now we're going to get into an even bigger global picture with
[2:04:53.800 --> 2:04:54.800]  Gonzalo Lira.
[2:04:54.800 --> 2:04:55.800]  Stay with us.
[2:04:55.800 --> 2:04:56.800]  We'll be right back.
[2:04:56.800 --> 2:05:01.800]  People say Alex Jones is crazy, he's a conspiracy theory guy, he's a nutcase, he's got these
[2:05:01.800 --> 2:05:04.520]  rants and all that.
[2:05:04.520 --> 2:05:11.200]  What they miss is that this guy's ahead of the curve on so many different topics of signal,
[2:05:11.200 --> 2:05:12.200]  not noise.
[2:05:12.200 --> 2:05:18.440]  If you look at the signal and you compare that to PBS and NPR and BBC and we'll do what
[2:05:18.440 --> 2:05:24.240]  Alex Jones put out there versus what your collective body has put out there and if you're
[2:05:24.240 --> 2:05:27.640]  setting a human being and just watching it and you say, well, Alex Jones is ahead of
[2:05:27.640 --> 2:05:32.640]  this, not only that, he kind of explained it, you are one of the great thinkers of this.
[2:05:32.640 --> 2:05:33.640]  That is very rare.
[2:05:33.640 --> 2:05:37.720]  You've got to go back almost to the revolutionary generation and see that.
[2:05:37.720 --> 2:05:41.000]  In this new book, I've got to tell you, when Tony Lyons first approached me, I read this
[2:05:41.000 --> 2:05:44.720]  thing, I go, this is it, this is no Beatrix.
[2:05:44.720 --> 2:05:47.200]  You're not going to be flipping pages here, you're going to be having a pin out, you're
[2:05:47.200 --> 2:05:48.600]  going to be underlying stuff.
[2:05:48.600 --> 2:06:03.240]  The Great Reset by Alex Jones, order your copy now at Amazon or InfowarsStore.com.
[2:06:03.240 --> 2:06:10.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[2:06:10.000 --> 2:06:21.000]  All right, welcome to the third hour of the Alex Jones show.
[2:06:21.000 --> 2:06:23.600]  I'm Mike Adams filling in for just a little bit here.
[2:06:23.600 --> 2:06:29.680]  Alex will be back in studio shortly and I'm joined by our special guest, Gonzalo Ndira.
[2:06:29.680 --> 2:06:35.080]  And this is a very important day for you to spread the word about this show and also support
[2:06:35.080 --> 2:06:42.360]  this platform, Infowars is under extreme attack by what can only be described as a rigged
[2:06:42.360 --> 2:06:49.800]  judicial system, which is no surprise, but Alex Jones is being railroaded in just an
[2:06:49.800 --> 2:06:58.440]  obscene manner by what I would consider to be just beyond bias, but corrupt judges and
[2:06:58.440 --> 2:07:02.160]  lawyers who are involved in trying to destroy this very platform.
[2:07:02.160 --> 2:07:04.320]  Your support is desperately needed.
[2:07:04.320 --> 2:07:09.320]  In fact, your financial support through the product purchases is what's going to keep
[2:07:09.320 --> 2:07:13.280]  this platform here and keep the voices.
[2:07:13.280 --> 2:07:17.440]  For example, the voices you're hearing today of Gonzalo Ndira or myself or the other guests,
[2:07:17.440 --> 2:07:20.080]  Robert Barnes is coming up in the fourth hour.
[2:07:20.080 --> 2:07:25.440]  These voices need a place to be heard for, frankly, for the, I think, the continuation
[2:07:25.440 --> 2:07:26.640]  of human civilization.
[2:07:26.640 --> 2:07:31.520]  We have to hear out the other side from the mainstream narrative.
[2:07:31.520 --> 2:07:37.640]  So right now, today, bodies, which is the turmeric formula that combines with black
[2:07:37.640 --> 2:07:40.920]  pepper, bodies is on sale at 25% off.
[2:07:40.920 --> 2:07:46.360]  It's back in stock, which is kind of a miracle these days, given the supply chain crisis.
[2:07:46.360 --> 2:07:50.840]  And you can find that at infowarstore.com and a couple of comments.
[2:07:50.840 --> 2:07:54.600]  Now, those of you who are familiar with my work, you know that I'm a, I'm a published
[2:07:54.600 --> 2:07:55.600]  food scientist.
[2:07:55.600 --> 2:08:00.880]  I own and operate a food analytics laboratory here in Central Texas.
[2:08:00.880 --> 2:08:04.840]  And by the way, in the green room right here in the studio right now, I have a, a large
[2:08:04.840 --> 2:08:12.680]  glass jar with blended avocados, cacao and turmeric with a touch of black pepper in it.
[2:08:12.680 --> 2:08:15.200]  That's exactly what's in the body's formula.
[2:08:15.200 --> 2:08:16.320]  And I drink that every day.
[2:08:16.320 --> 2:08:20.960]  I've been doing that for more than 15 years and was a former type two diabetic myself
[2:08:20.960 --> 2:08:23.400]  or right on the borderline of that.
[2:08:23.400 --> 2:08:26.520]  Never had a problem since I got turned on to nutrition.
[2:08:26.520 --> 2:08:34.600]  And what I know about turmeric is that it, it helps support the body's natural response
[2:08:34.600 --> 2:08:38.360]  to things like inflammation, but affecting multiple systems.
[2:08:38.360 --> 2:08:43.600]  It can help support normal neurological function, normal cardiovascular function.
[2:08:43.600 --> 2:08:46.960]  And when I look around today and remember the last time I was here, I had my microscope
[2:08:46.960 --> 2:08:52.000]  and we were looking at those clots that were pulled out of the bodies of people who died
[2:08:52.000 --> 2:08:53.700]  after taking the vaccines.
[2:08:53.700 --> 2:08:58.560]  We did a little clot analysis and grossed some people out, by the way, that show with
[2:08:58.560 --> 2:08:59.560]  Dr. Jane Ruby.
[2:08:59.560 --> 2:09:05.160]  Well, I believe, and I can't yet support it scientifically, but there's more coming out.
[2:09:05.160 --> 2:09:11.840]  I believe that cardiovascular clot formation is tied to vascular inflammation.
[2:09:11.840 --> 2:09:17.120]  In fact, there's no question in my mind that that's the case, which means that we can choose.
[2:09:17.120 --> 2:09:23.320]  You can choose foods and lifestyle habits and super foods and appropriate supplements
[2:09:23.320 --> 2:09:28.560]  or spices or roots that can help your body respond in a healthy way to all of these insults
[2:09:28.560 --> 2:09:34.680]  that affect us, whether it's viral shedding or environmental toxins or stress or whatever.
[2:09:34.680 --> 2:09:39.760]  You know, junk food, maybe went out and had some fried onions and I don't know, some really
[2:09:39.760 --> 2:09:41.360]  badly burned barbecue.
[2:09:41.360 --> 2:09:45.800]  Well, guess what, hey, we all enjoy barbecue from time to time, but make sure you protect
[2:09:45.800 --> 2:09:48.040]  your body with the right supplements.
[2:09:48.040 --> 2:09:51.640]  And by doing so, you can support Infowars and keep this platform online.
[2:09:51.640 --> 2:09:57.600]  Again, infowarsstore.com, take advantage of bodies 25% off today, and also vitamin mineral
[2:09:57.600 --> 2:10:02.680]  fusion is back in stock at 40% off, and that's an outstanding combination of vitamins and
[2:10:02.680 --> 2:10:03.680]  minerals.
[2:10:03.680 --> 2:10:11.000]  And I wholeheartedly endorse these formulas, and I can personally attest to the improvement
[2:10:11.000 --> 2:10:12.280]  that you will experience.
[2:10:12.280 --> 2:10:15.520]  Give yourself 30 days on these supplements, seriously.
[2:10:15.520 --> 2:10:20.560]  Buy them, try them for 30 days, keep a log of what happens to your experience and you
[2:10:20.560 --> 2:10:22.800]  will notice a tremendous difference.
[2:10:22.800 --> 2:10:25.880]  It's nutrition, it's cause and effect.
[2:10:25.880 --> 2:10:29.640]  So speaking of cause and effect, we're going to go right back to Gonzalo Lyra, because
[2:10:29.640 --> 2:10:34.120]  I think Mr. Lyra believes, as I do, that we live in a universe of cause and effect.
[2:10:34.120 --> 2:10:39.640]  So if causes are initiated, then effects will materialize.
[2:10:39.640 --> 2:10:45.120]  And whereas the West is preoccupied with delusional fairytale thinking, such as, oh,
[2:10:45.120 --> 2:10:50.520]  men can get pregnant and we don't need natural gas, hydrocarbon molecules, we'll just imagine
[2:10:50.520 --> 2:10:54.600]  – like, why can't the people of Germany just self-identify that we're not starving
[2:10:54.600 --> 2:10:56.040]  and freezing this coming January?
[2:10:56.040 --> 2:10:58.800]  The reason is because that's not real.
[2:10:58.800 --> 2:11:00.240]  You can't just make believe, right?
[2:11:00.240 --> 2:11:03.040]  So, yes, Gonzalo, your comments on all that.
[2:11:03.040 --> 2:11:07.360]  Well, you know, just pathetically, before I jump into that, I wanted to mention something
[2:11:07.360 --> 2:11:12.240]  that is deeply, deeply troubling to me, and perhaps you've been covering it on your show
[2:11:12.240 --> 2:11:14.720]  or Alex has been covering it.
[2:11:14.720 --> 2:11:21.240]  Well, the thing is that there are more deaths and fewer births, and this trend is accelerating.
[2:11:21.240 --> 2:11:22.800]  And a lot of people are starting to notice it.
[2:11:22.800 --> 2:11:26.160]  And I think that people who are listening to your broadcasts should be paying attention
[2:11:26.160 --> 2:11:27.160]  to this.
[2:11:27.160 --> 2:11:30.360]  Frankly, if there's anything that I can leave you with is this.
[2:11:30.360 --> 2:11:34.920]  In different countries around the world, in the United Kingdom, in Italy, in Germany,
[2:11:34.920 --> 2:11:43.920]  in Taiwan, they are noticing that there is an increase of mortality month over month.
[2:11:43.920 --> 2:11:45.640]  That's a trend that's accelerating.
[2:11:45.640 --> 2:11:49.280]  And they really started noticing it at the beginning of this year, in January of this
[2:11:49.280 --> 2:11:50.280]  year.
[2:11:50.280 --> 2:11:56.400]  And at the same time, you are seeing a decrease in live births.
[2:11:56.400 --> 2:12:01.920]  And that trend is also increasing month over month, starting this January.
[2:12:01.920 --> 2:12:06.400]  You see the birth and death rates, you know, if you take a bunch of graphs of like 10 years
[2:12:06.400 --> 2:12:09.960]  and superimpose them, they're very parallel to one another.
[2:12:09.960 --> 2:12:11.360]  They don't really change.
[2:12:11.360 --> 2:12:16.040]  There are certain spikes every year that happen at the same time, like around Christmas and
[2:12:16.040 --> 2:12:17.120]  New Year's.
[2:12:17.120 --> 2:12:23.760]  More people tend to die during those two weeks because of car crashes, because of, you know,
[2:12:23.760 --> 2:12:28.000]  fights, domestic disputes and whatnot, also because some people who are very, very sick
[2:12:28.000 --> 2:12:32.600]  try to hold on to life until Christmas for sentimental reasons and all the rest of it,
[2:12:32.600 --> 2:12:34.400]  being with their families and so forth.
[2:12:34.400 --> 2:12:37.560]  But the graphs tend to be very, very much the same.
[2:12:37.560 --> 2:12:44.000]  The variations are very minor, but starting in January of this year, the number of deaths
[2:12:44.000 --> 2:12:52.800]  in every country that has had, guess what, it's been increasing month over month.
[2:12:52.800 --> 2:12:55.640]  It's getting worse in the UK.
[2:12:55.640 --> 2:12:57.480]  I believe it's the UK or Sweden.
[2:12:57.480 --> 2:12:58.960]  Actually, I'm mixing up my figures.
[2:12:58.960 --> 2:13:04.120]  Unfortunately, I didn't have a little cheat sheet here, but you can look it up for yourself.
[2:13:04.120 --> 2:13:09.840]  It started at 5% more mortality in the month of January, and then it went up to 8%, and
[2:13:09.840 --> 2:13:18.880]  then 11% by March, and 15% by April and June, which was the last month, it was nearly 20%.
[2:13:18.880 --> 2:13:19.880]  It's increasing.
[2:13:19.880 --> 2:13:24.800]  Again, like I said, the number of live births are decreasing.
[2:13:24.800 --> 2:13:25.800]  This is a catastrophe.
[2:13:25.800 --> 2:13:26.800]  You're absolutely right.
[2:13:26.800 --> 2:13:27.800]  This is obvious.
[2:13:27.800 --> 2:13:33.600]  The globalists are achieving their goal, and by the way, this is affecting the countries
[2:13:33.600 --> 2:13:36.160]  and the people that we care about.
[2:13:36.160 --> 2:13:40.680]  I know that you care about the people of Ukraine.
[2:13:40.680 --> 2:13:43.680]  I think you are everywhere.
[2:13:43.680 --> 2:13:49.840]  I want people to live as happily as they can, as for as long as they can.
[2:13:49.840 --> 2:13:55.400]  Every day, we are hearing that somebody suddenly collapsed and died, and a relatively healthy
[2:13:55.400 --> 2:13:56.400]  person.
[2:13:56.400 --> 2:14:00.800]  Sometimes, there are guys in their teens, in their 20s, and they're dropping dead for
[2:14:00.800 --> 2:14:01.800]  no reason.
[2:14:01.800 --> 2:14:05.880]  They're floating all over the place, and people are like, oh, well, pretending that
[2:14:05.880 --> 2:14:10.280]  it's not happening, it's happening, and you've got to look at it.
[2:14:10.280 --> 2:14:15.440]  You have to look the truth in the face, and you have to realize that something horrible
[2:14:15.440 --> 2:14:21.640]  is happening, and the people who are in charge of things, the people who approve these gene
[2:14:21.640 --> 2:14:26.960]  therapy because that's what it is, they did so just to score some political points and
[2:14:26.960 --> 2:14:28.200]  to make some money.
[2:14:28.200 --> 2:14:29.480]  That's the worst part.
[2:14:29.480 --> 2:14:34.600]  They endangered the lives of hundreds of millions of people just so that they could have like
[2:14:34.600 --> 2:14:37.600]  a little house in Martha's Vineyard or some garbage like that.
[2:14:37.600 --> 2:14:41.680]  Let me bring this in, Gonzalo, because this comes from Children's Health Defense.
[2:14:41.680 --> 2:14:47.400]  There's a new study that has found that 15% of American adults have been diagnosed with
[2:14:47.400 --> 2:14:53.080]  serious conditions after taking COVID vaccines, 15%.
[2:14:53.080 --> 2:15:00.360]  That is extraordinary, and of those who complained of symptoms following vaccines, 21% or about
[2:15:00.360 --> 2:15:05.200]  1 in 5 complained of blood clots, and yet, let me just share this, what people learned
[2:15:05.200 --> 2:15:10.520]  exclusively actually here on Infowars when I was here with a microscope and the clots,
[2:15:10.520 --> 2:15:12.160]  these are not blood clots, folks.
[2:15:12.160 --> 2:15:13.160]  These are something else.
[2:15:13.160 --> 2:15:19.000]  These are self-assembling bio structures, probably made of proteins.
[2:15:19.000 --> 2:15:23.760]  They're not themselves alive, but they are occupying the blood vessels and they are causing
[2:15:23.760 --> 2:15:28.160]  people to not get blood to their heart or their brain, and that's when they kill over
[2:15:28.160 --> 2:15:29.840]  and die like you were just talking about.
[2:15:29.840 --> 2:15:31.680]  People are dying in huge numbers.
[2:15:31.680 --> 2:15:33.960]  The insurance companies are also reporting these figures.
[2:15:33.960 --> 2:15:36.920]  Now, we got to take a quick break, Gonzalo.
[2:15:36.920 --> 2:15:37.920]  Please stay with us.
[2:15:37.920 --> 2:15:40.640]  I know it's getting later there in Ukraine, but we'll be right back after this break.
[2:15:40.640 --> 2:15:44.920]  I've got more questions for you, a lot of territory to cover, but you're absolutely
[2:15:44.920 --> 2:15:45.920]  right.
[2:15:45.920 --> 2:15:50.960]  The birth rate is increasing, the live birth rate is decreasing, the globalists are achieving
[2:15:50.960 --> 2:15:53.480]  infertility and genocide against humanity.
[2:15:53.480 --> 2:15:56.640]  We'll be right back with more.
[2:15:56.640 --> 2:16:03.640]  Sold out for seven months, bodies' ultimate turmeric formula is back in stock.

[2:16:57.000 --> 2:17:02.120]  Several years ago, I approached one of the top companies in the U.S. that supplies the
[2:17:02.120 --> 2:17:07.320]  highest quality signature reducing faraday cages to the Pentagon and other U.S. government
[2:17:07.320 --> 2:17:08.320]  agencies.

[2:17:24.640 --> 2:17:27.120]  you want to put in like desktop computers.
[2:17:27.120 --> 2:17:33.920]  It is all exclusively available at infowarstore.com under the Redux name.

[2:17:38.600 --> 2:17:39.600]  at infowarstore.com.
[2:17:39.600 --> 2:17:45.600]  In this insane world, you are crazy if you don't protect your signature, your identity
[2:17:45.600 --> 2:17:50.040]  from identity theft, hackers, criminals, corporations, governments.
[2:17:50.040 --> 2:17:56.280]  This is one of the hottest items out there today that's exclusively available at infowarstore.com.
[2:17:56.280 --> 2:18:01.640]  The globalists are fighting around the clock to destroy the family, to destroy heterosexual
[2:18:01.640 --> 2:18:06.240]  relationships, to annihilate our marriages and the studies are all clear.
[2:18:06.240 --> 2:18:12.880]  The number one cause of marital splits is that there is problems in the bedroom and the number
[2:18:12.880 --> 2:18:16.600]  one issue men have is erectile dysfunction.
[2:18:16.600 --> 2:18:20.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, the left makes big jokes about this because they don't want people
[2:18:20.280 --> 2:18:22.720]  having lasting good love and relationships.
[2:18:22.720 --> 2:18:29.080]  They want to break up society and we are so excited to have the number one natural male
[2:18:29.080 --> 2:18:33.760]  enhancement pill in the world available as a major sponsor now.

[2:18:56.320 --> 2:19:02.520]  We are now living in the void, sliding towards collapse in the strange space between what
[2:19:02.520 --> 2:19:04.920]  we've known and what's to come.
[2:19:04.920 --> 2:19:11.280]  And right now, the most important thing to remember is don't panic, stay calm because
[2:19:11.280 --> 2:19:17.720]  now is the time that we must get our bearings and steer the ship onto a safe sound course.
[2:19:17.720 --> 2:19:23.560]  There is nothing stopping we the people from making our own rules and building our own
[2:19:23.560 --> 2:19:24.560]  society.
[2:19:24.560 --> 2:19:30.160]  All we got to do is survive the crash and right now, we still have time to prepare.
[2:19:30.160 --> 2:19:34.440]  The world fiat currency system is racing towards zero.
[2:19:34.440 --> 2:19:40.760]  It's time to convert it into hard assets now, including food, water and survival gear to
[2:19:40.760 --> 2:19:43.160]  keep us strong and at the ready.
[2:19:43.160 --> 2:19:50.840]  Go to preparedtoday.com for the essentials, storable foods, water filtration, first aid,
[2:19:50.840 --> 2:19:57.840]  power and more at preparedtoday.com.
[2:19:57.840 --> 2:20:14.080]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:14.080 --> 2:20:15.360]  All right, it's an extraordinary day.
[2:20:15.360 --> 2:20:17.440]  I'm Mike Adams filling in for Alex Jones.
[2:20:17.440 --> 2:20:22.280]  He will be joining us now in the fourth hour today with attorney Robert Barnes, and I was
[2:20:22.280 --> 2:20:27.960]  speaking with Robert Barnes just a few minutes ago out in the hallway and oh, he's got some
[2:20:27.960 --> 2:20:32.800]  good stuff to share with you the analysis of what's going on with the courts.
[2:20:32.800 --> 2:20:36.200]  And I mean, I'll go ahead and tell you, I was asking him, I was like, isn't this going
[2:20:36.200 --> 2:20:41.880]  to be appealed and won't the appeal, I mean, if there's a rational group of judges that
[2:20:41.880 --> 2:20:47.280]  hears what happened in this railroading of Alex Jones through the legal system, won't
[2:20:47.280 --> 2:20:49.440]  this be overturned?
[2:20:49.440 --> 2:20:53.200]  And I suppose I'll just say to hear the answer, tune in to the fourth hour, Robert Barnes
[2:20:53.200 --> 2:21:00.160]  will give it to you, but if this railroading of Alex Jones stands, the pillars of Western
[2:21:00.160 --> 2:21:04.480]  civilization, at least the judicial pillars, have crumbled.
[2:21:04.480 --> 2:21:09.760]  And that's the thing, every nation and every institution right now, whether we're talking
[2:21:09.760 --> 2:21:14.600]  about Germany or the UK or NATO or the United States or the Supreme Court or whatever, every
[2:21:14.600 --> 2:21:17.520]  institution and nation must make a choice.
[2:21:17.520 --> 2:21:21.200]  Do we stand on principle and then have a future?
[2:21:21.200 --> 2:21:27.440]  Or do we make this up as we go along and just wing it and commit institutional suicide in
[2:21:27.440 --> 2:21:28.680]  the process?
[2:21:28.680 --> 2:21:34.720]  Because if we don't have fairness, you see, the human mind is tuned in to fairness.
[2:21:34.720 --> 2:21:39.240]  If we don't have fairness, then we don't have the consent of the people.
[2:21:39.240 --> 2:21:40.520]  We lose fairness.
[2:21:40.520 --> 2:21:41.520]  You lose the people.
[2:21:41.520 --> 2:21:46.480]  And right now, the Biden regime is losing the people, and frankly, so is the Zelensky
[2:21:46.480 --> 2:21:49.800]  regime in Ukraine, and I think most of Western Europe as well.
[2:21:49.800 --> 2:21:55.160]  So we're bringing in, again, Gonzalo Lyra to comment on all of this, and I really want
[2:21:55.160 --> 2:22:03.120]  to ask you to now give us your assessment of, does Western civilization as a whole have
[2:22:03.120 --> 2:22:05.600]  a future if we stay on this current course?
[2:22:05.600 --> 2:22:09.080]  Or can we avert the worst case scenario?
[2:22:09.080 --> 2:22:11.480]  Or have we doomed ourselves already?
[2:22:11.480 --> 2:22:15.120]  Where do we stand in history right now?
[2:22:15.120 --> 2:22:19.680]  I personally believe that the crash is inevitable, because you see, the people who are currently
[2:22:19.680 --> 2:22:24.920]  in charge of the regime in the West, the West, I talk about Western Europe, the United States,
[2:22:24.920 --> 2:22:28.160]  Canada, and Australia, New Zealand, well, the thing is, see, they are committed to this
[2:22:28.160 --> 2:22:33.440]  course of action of repressing any kind of dissent, because you see, at heart, I think
[2:22:33.440 --> 2:22:37.000]  that they recognize that they are wrong what they're doing.
[2:22:37.000 --> 2:22:41.800]  And see, what happens when you realize that you're wrong, but you don't have the humility
[2:22:41.800 --> 2:22:46.800]  to accept that, or you're afraid, because if you accept it and say, yes, I'm wrong,
[2:22:46.800 --> 2:22:50.160]  then people are going to discover all kinds of crimes that you might have committed.
[2:22:50.160 --> 2:22:53.400]  Well, your only solution is to repress more.
[2:22:53.400 --> 2:22:58.280]  The more people tell the truth about what's really going on, the more repression there's
[2:22:58.280 --> 2:23:00.480]  going to be.
[2:23:00.480 --> 2:23:03.680]  It's as simple as night follows day.
[2:23:03.680 --> 2:23:09.800]  The repression comes not because you're telling lies or telling things that are not true.
[2:23:09.800 --> 2:23:14.200]  No, the repression comes because you're telling things that are true.
[2:23:14.200 --> 2:23:21.520]  See in the Soviet Union, they didn't bar the guy who was telling lies or telling foolish
[2:23:21.520 --> 2:23:22.720]  stories.
[2:23:22.720 --> 2:23:27.840]  They censored the man who was telling the truth about Stalin, about what was going on
[2:23:27.840 --> 2:23:32.680]  in the Soviet Union back in the day, see, and that's what's going on in the current regime
[2:23:32.680 --> 2:23:34.680]  that we have in the West.
[2:23:34.680 --> 2:23:39.040]  We call it the Biden regime, but it's giving too much credit to this Biden individual.
[2:23:39.040 --> 2:23:43.920]  This poor, decrepit, senile old man who's a criminal, and a thief and a liar, but that's
[2:23:43.920 --> 2:23:46.920]  for another story, and also apparently a pervert.
[2:23:46.920 --> 2:23:51.280]  His own daughter says so in her diaries, but that's another story.
[2:23:51.280 --> 2:23:52.640]  It's not just Biden.
[2:23:52.640 --> 2:23:59.000]  It's this whole class of people, and their continued success, their position, their money,
[2:23:59.000 --> 2:24:03.840]  their livelihoods depend on continuing these lies.
[2:24:03.840 --> 2:24:09.960]  Once your life depends on lies, you have to go more and more totalitarian, more and more
[2:24:09.960 --> 2:24:16.320]  extreme in how you push down anybody who tells the truth.
[2:24:16.320 --> 2:24:17.320]  That's inevitable.
[2:24:17.320 --> 2:24:18.320]  Okay?
[2:24:18.320 --> 2:24:19.320]  That's what we're seeing.
[2:24:19.320 --> 2:24:26.720]  You, myself, Robert Barnes, anybody who is telling the truth, he gets censored.
[2:24:26.720 --> 2:24:32.400]  James Lindsay, with whom I had a delightful broadcast yesterday, it was incredibly illuminating
[2:24:32.400 --> 2:24:35.520]  and educational and fun, and it was just fantastic.
[2:24:35.520 --> 2:24:41.920]  He got his Twitter banned today, not because he was lying, not because he was telling falsehoods,
[2:24:41.920 --> 2:24:44.080]  not because he was telling misinformation.
[2:24:44.080 --> 2:24:45.080]  No, no, no.
[2:24:45.080 --> 2:24:47.840]  They banned him because he was telling the truth.
[2:24:47.840 --> 2:24:50.360]  The more truth you tell, the worse it gets.
[2:24:50.360 --> 2:24:55.080]  It's like, look, you know the Hans Christian Anderson fable of the emperor's new clothes,
[2:24:55.080 --> 2:24:56.080]  right?
[2:24:56.080 --> 2:25:01.720]  The emperor gets this fancy clothes that's being sold to him by these con men, and the
[2:25:01.720 --> 2:25:07.080]  con men tell him that only very sophisticated people can see this incredible cloth.
[2:25:07.080 --> 2:25:12.080]  And so, finally, the emperor wears these new clothes that are transparent, they're invisible,
[2:25:12.080 --> 2:25:18.160]  in fact, there are no clothes, and there's a little boy, and the little boy, as the king
[2:25:18.160 --> 2:25:23.160]  is parading and everybody says, oh, what a beautiful suit, this little boy says, why
[2:25:23.160 --> 2:25:26.680]  is that man walking naked?
[2:25:26.680 --> 2:25:30.200]  Do you know what happened to that boy who pointed out the truth?
[2:25:30.200 --> 2:25:32.280]  Because that's the real story.
[2:25:32.280 --> 2:25:37.520]  The little boy who points out that the emperor is naked, that he's not wearing any clothes,
[2:25:37.520 --> 2:25:40.480]  that it's all nonsense, that it's all baloney.
[2:25:40.480 --> 2:25:47.800]  The little boy is the one who gets snatched up, whipped, thrown into God knows where, some
[2:25:47.800 --> 2:25:53.080]  cellar somewhere without his dinner, yeah, or if he's an adult, if he's a man, he
[2:25:53.080 --> 2:25:57.180]  gets censored, he gets de-platformed, he gets his credit cards canceled.
[2:25:57.180 --> 2:26:03.240]  This has happened to everybody in the information sphere that is trying to tell people the truth,
[2:26:03.240 --> 2:26:05.240]  the truth about what's actually happening.
[2:26:05.240 --> 2:26:11.480]  Now, like Mike, you and I, we've talked about it privately, you have certain ideas about
[2:26:11.480 --> 2:26:15.600]  certain things, I have certain ideas about other things, we have certain disagreements,
[2:26:15.600 --> 2:26:19.040]  but that doesn't mean that we don't have respect for one another, that doesn't mean that we
[2:26:19.040 --> 2:26:25.160]  cannot have a civilized adult conversation where we disagree and it's perfectly fine.
[2:26:25.160 --> 2:26:30.960]  Because you see, your position is not based on a lie, my position is not based on a lie.
[2:26:30.960 --> 2:26:39.200]  Neither one of our position is based on corruption, on theft, on using our position to make money,
[2:26:39.200 --> 2:26:43.440]  but the regimes of the West, that's what's going on.
[2:26:43.440 --> 2:26:47.840]  They are corrupt, they steal, it's a cartocracy.
[2:26:47.840 --> 2:26:52.640]  And so, because of that, they have to silence people who are telling the truth, they have
[2:26:52.640 --> 2:27:00.040]  to persecute them judiciously by way of the judiciary, they have to silence everybody
[2:27:00.040 --> 2:27:06.280]  who tells the truth, because if people hear the truth, enough people hear the truth, then
[2:27:06.280 --> 2:27:10.080]  their whole disgusting corruption collapses.
[2:27:10.080 --> 2:27:11.080]  And that's what they're terrible at.
[2:27:11.080 --> 2:27:12.080]  That's exactly right.
[2:27:12.080 --> 2:27:16.720]  And this is, I mean, you just encapsulated the railroading of Alex Jones right now through
[2:27:16.720 --> 2:27:22.400]  the judicial system, for every one statement that Alex might get wrong, which he later
[2:27:22.400 --> 2:27:28.560]  corrects and apologizes for as soon as he realizes it, he'll probably have 999 statements
[2:27:28.560 --> 2:27:33.920]  that were right on that were the truth that they don't want people to hear.
[2:27:33.920 --> 2:27:34.920]  Exactly the same.
[2:27:34.920 --> 2:27:38.480]  And I can't help but think, as you were describing that, Gonzalo, and thank you for that.
[2:27:38.480 --> 2:27:45.080]  The greatest lie of all in our global economy is fiat currency, the money printing, the
[2:27:45.080 --> 2:27:47.120]  petrodollar status.
[2:27:47.120 --> 2:27:53.040]  I was seeing a story yesterday from, I think it's called the Black Farmers Association of
[2:27:53.040 --> 2:27:54.960]  America or some rendition of that.
[2:27:54.960 --> 2:27:59.040]  I think Boyd is the last name of the leader of that group.
[2:27:59.040 --> 2:28:02.160]  And he was saying, look, black farmers are suffering in America because of much higher
[2:28:02.160 --> 2:28:05.920]  prices of fertilizer and higher prices of diesel.
[2:28:05.920 --> 2:28:09.600]  All the inputs, including labor and so on, black farmers are losing their farms, small
[2:28:09.600 --> 2:28:11.920]  family farms are going bankrupt.
[2:28:11.920 --> 2:28:17.200]  And I thought to myself, yes, this man is absolutely correct and why are those prices
[2:28:17.200 --> 2:28:18.200]  going up?
[2:28:18.200 --> 2:28:23.360]  A lot of it is money printing, not 100%, but a whole lot of it is money printing.
[2:28:23.360 --> 2:28:29.440]  So the great theft from black farmers and frankly white farmers and all Latino farmers,
[2:28:29.440 --> 2:28:34.400]  all the farmers and all the American people is the money printing con, which is the emperor
[2:28:34.400 --> 2:28:35.920]  wearing no clothes.
[2:28:35.920 --> 2:28:40.200]  And I regret I'll have to ask you to wait on your response because we have to take another
[2:28:40.200 --> 2:28:41.200]  break.
[2:28:41.200 --> 2:28:43.080]  But think about that.
[2:28:43.080 --> 2:28:45.480]  We'll be right back with Gonzalo Lira.
[2:28:45.480 --> 2:28:47.880]  Please stay with us for at least one more segment if you would, sir.
[2:28:47.880 --> 2:28:49.240]  I just greatly appreciate it.
[2:28:49.240 --> 2:28:50.240]  This is the Alex Jones show.
[2:28:50.240 --> 2:28:56.960]  We'll be right back after this break with more.
[2:28:56.960 --> 2:29:01.060]  The great reset in the war for the world is the book that the government doesn't want
[2:29:01.060 --> 2:29:06.080]  you to read, that most of the big, powerful companies trying to control your life, the
[2:29:06.080 --> 2:29:09.440]  big tech companies, they don't want you to read this book.
[2:29:09.440 --> 2:29:14.120]  They want to control what you think, what you do, what you read, but you don't want
[2:29:14.120 --> 2:29:15.120]  that.
[2:29:15.120 --> 2:29:16.280]  And Alex Jones doesn't want that.
[2:29:16.280 --> 2:29:20.960]  And this book shows you what's happening and gives you the sort of playbook for how to
[2:29:20.960 --> 2:29:22.080]  fight against it.
[2:29:22.080 --> 2:29:26.560]  And so by buying this book, you're going to prove that censorship doesn't work, that
[2:29:26.560 --> 2:29:28.720]  freedom is alive in this country.
[2:29:28.720 --> 2:29:30.760]  This is a central reading.
[2:29:30.760 --> 2:29:35.360]  And you know, I would go right now and buy it before the censorship kicks in.
[2:29:35.360 --> 2:29:37.640]  It's not going to be available in bookstores.
[2:29:37.640 --> 2:29:39.760]  It's not going to be available in libraries.
[2:29:39.760 --> 2:29:43.440]  They're going to try to take it down from every platform that they can, but they're
[2:29:43.440 --> 2:29:45.280]  not going to be able to do it.
[2:29:45.280 --> 2:29:47.120]  Prove that censorship doesn't work.
[2:29:47.120 --> 2:29:48.400]  Buy the great reset.
[2:29:48.400 --> 2:29:49.400]  Thank you, Alex Jones.
[2:29:49.400 --> 2:29:53.560]  I really appreciate you having me on, and I appreciate you writing this book and getting
[2:29:53.560 --> 2:29:56.160]  the information out there.

[2:31:56.040 --> 2:32:00.600]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria or a pump gas or whether you're a farmer, a rancher,
[2:32:00.600 --> 2:32:05.800]  a doctor, a lawyer or a millionaire, Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these profiles.
[2:32:05.800 --> 2:32:06.800]  You see it every year.
[2:32:06.800 --> 2:32:11.880]  30 different tax returns, 30 different answers, 50 different tax returns, 50 different answers
[2:32:11.880 --> 2:32:17.400]  and almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms and the big tax groups
[2:32:17.400 --> 2:32:21.200]  because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public understanding
[2:32:21.200 --> 2:32:22.200]  this and knowing this.
[2:32:22.200 --> 2:32:27.800]  So it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody
[2:32:27.800 --> 2:32:33.080]  to be able to do things tax wise that's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more your
[2:32:33.080 --> 2:32:34.080]  money.
[2:32:34.080 --> 2:32:38.800]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.
[2:32:38.800 --> 2:32:45.960]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL, jonestaxrelief.com, one word, jonestaxrelief.com
[2:32:45.960 --> 2:32:58.000]  or call 833-904-285-833-904-285.
[2:32:58.000 --> 2:33:15.920]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:15.920 --> 2:33:19.120]  You've found it, the tip of the spear.
[2:33:19.120 --> 2:33:23.760]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Mike Adams.
[2:33:23.760 --> 2:33:30.040]  I hope you're enjoying this show as much as I am, folks.
[2:33:30.040 --> 2:33:35.200]  I mean, I'm having a blast because I get to talk to a really intelligent guy here, Gonzalo
[2:33:35.200 --> 2:33:41.560]  Lira from Kharkov, Ukraine, and we get to cover a number of subjects and I, you know,
[2:33:41.560 --> 2:33:43.480]  it's not just about IQ.
[2:33:43.480 --> 2:33:49.080]  It's about people who have the courage to just say it as they see it, right, to just
[2:33:49.080 --> 2:33:50.080]  tell the truth.
[2:33:50.080 --> 2:33:54.760]  Because we can run around and we can find high IQ doctors, let's say, some of whom are
[2:33:54.760 --> 2:34:00.200]  just, you know, killing people by avoiding the evidence of vaccine damages.
[2:34:00.200 --> 2:34:04.920]  It's not about how smart you are, necessarily, from an academic point of view.
[2:34:04.920 --> 2:34:10.840]  It's about that combination of courage, that willingness to tell the truth and also not
[2:34:10.840 --> 2:34:15.640]  putting up with the lies, and I would dare say, I think right now in our world, at least
[2:34:15.640 --> 2:34:22.720]  in our kind of blogosphere of analysts and voices, that Gonzalo Lira is one of the most
[2:34:22.720 --> 2:34:27.640]  observant people and the most courageous, just willing to tell it like it is.
[2:34:27.640 --> 2:34:31.920]  He's got a YouTube channel called Gonzalo Lira 2, I believe.
[2:34:31.920 --> 2:34:37.080]  I'm not sure what happened to Gonzalo Lira 1, but he's got Gonzalo Lira 2, so you can
[2:34:37.080 --> 2:34:42.360]  find him on YouTube, and he's got these roundtables that are fascinating, and frankly, he's occupying
[2:34:42.360 --> 2:34:47.920]  a lot of my time because I'm listening to everything that he puts out, so Mr. Lira,
[2:34:47.920 --> 2:34:48.920]  welcome back.
[2:34:48.920 --> 2:34:51.440]  Thank you for staying late, and I really appreciate everything that you're doing.
[2:34:51.440 --> 2:34:53.840]  It's my pleasure, and thank you so much for your so kind words.
[2:34:53.840 --> 2:34:55.240]  That was very much appreciated.
[2:34:55.240 --> 2:34:56.240]  Thank you.
[2:34:56.240 --> 2:34:57.640]  Well, you know, you deserve it.
[2:34:57.640 --> 2:34:58.640]  You've earned it.
[2:34:58.640 --> 2:35:02.000]  I mean, here you are, you know, in Ukraine.
[2:35:02.000 --> 2:35:03.000]  And you're there.
[2:35:03.000 --> 2:35:08.400]  It was just an accident because I live here, and my wife is Ukrainian.
[2:35:08.400 --> 2:35:09.400]  I met her in Europe.
[2:35:09.400 --> 2:35:14.920]  I was living in Paris a few years ago, over a decade ago, and I met her through friends
[2:35:14.920 --> 2:35:19.440]  from college, and she was working there as an au pair, and you know, one thing led to
[2:35:19.440 --> 2:35:23.760]  next, and here we are with two kids, and they're perfectly safe and sound.
[2:35:23.760 --> 2:35:25.200]  They're nowhere near this war zone.
[2:35:25.200 --> 2:35:29.120]  They're actually at the beach, so they're having a wonderful time, and because of different
[2:35:29.120 --> 2:35:32.680]  circumstances, I had to stay behind, and I'm sort of like a little bit stuck here for the
[2:35:32.680 --> 2:35:34.440]  time being, but that's not really important.
[2:35:34.440 --> 2:35:39.560]  What's important is that, you know, everything is going well, and the kids are fine, and they're
[2:35:39.560 --> 2:35:44.320]  having a blast, and they're tanned, nearly black, and they're having a wonderful, wonderful
[2:35:44.320 --> 2:35:45.920]  time, which is the important thing.
[2:35:45.920 --> 2:35:46.920]  Okay.
[2:35:46.920 --> 2:35:47.920]  Outstanding.
[2:35:47.920 --> 2:35:52.400]  Now, I'd like to get your reaction on some news that broke that's just truly shocking.
[2:35:52.400 --> 2:35:53.640]  Check this out.
[2:35:53.640 --> 2:35:55.160]  This is from WesternJournal.com.
[2:35:55.160 --> 2:36:03.320]  The headline is as follows, our dead pig brought into state of undeath after being pumped full
[2:36:03.320 --> 2:36:09.400]  of scientific sludge, now they want to use it on humans, and I'm thinking, of course,
[2:36:09.400 --> 2:36:14.120]  because I'm always, I have a comedy circuit that's going, I'm thinking Joe Biden, right?
[2:36:14.120 --> 2:36:22.540]  They already used it, but it's, this is a zombie concoction that they can pump it into
[2:36:22.540 --> 2:36:27.320]  dead pigs, and then the pigs organs start to come alive again, and they have to even
[2:36:27.320 --> 2:36:33.000]  pump it full of kind of like a anti-twitch chemicals to stop the head from jerking and
[2:36:33.000 --> 2:36:37.360]  twitching, and of course, I'm immediately thinking Hillary Clinton, but you get my point.
[2:36:37.360 --> 2:36:40.320]  I mean, is this some kind of mad science thing?
[2:36:40.320 --> 2:36:41.320]  What is this?
[2:36:41.320 --> 2:36:45.480]  Look, it's a lack of judgment, because you see, just because you can do something doesn't
[2:36:45.480 --> 2:36:48.200]  mean that you ought to do that thing.
[2:36:48.200 --> 2:36:52.160]  And sometimes there are things that you should just leave alone.
[2:36:52.160 --> 2:36:56.200]  For instance, all of these gain-of-function researches, right?
[2:36:56.200 --> 2:37:01.680]  They're trying to basically figure out a way to weaponize viruses, and this stuff, it can
[2:37:01.680 --> 2:37:04.160]  get away from you, and it could be catastrophic.
[2:37:04.160 --> 2:37:10.480]  This time around, we got lucky, because it's very obvious that the COVID-19 virus was engineered,
[2:37:10.480 --> 2:37:14.440]  as I understand it, and please correct me if I'm wrong, but I understand that part of
[2:37:14.440 --> 2:37:20.680]  the DNA sequence of this virus was patented by Monsanto or Pfizer, one of these conglomerates.
[2:37:20.680 --> 2:37:23.920]  You know, I mean, it was clearly a manufactured virus.
[2:37:23.920 --> 2:37:31.200]  That all in all, I mean, I mean, no disrespect to the people who lost loved ones, but generally,
[2:37:31.200 --> 2:37:35.520]  we got lucky because not many people died of it in terms of percentages of the total
[2:37:35.520 --> 2:37:38.040]  population that got this disease, right?
[2:37:38.040 --> 2:37:43.120]  Now, imagine if it had been much worse, if it had been like the bubonic plague or some
[2:37:43.120 --> 2:37:49.800]  sort of aerosolized cancer of some sort, something catastrophic like that.
[2:37:49.800 --> 2:37:53.920]  You know, I mean, this stuff gets away with you because people are sloppy, people get
[2:37:53.920 --> 2:37:58.960]  tired, people just make mistakes, and they don't mean anything by it, but all of a sudden,
[2:37:58.960 --> 2:38:03.640]  some horrible virus escapes and wreaks havoc.
[2:38:03.640 --> 2:38:07.960]  You should have the judgment to realize that there are some things that you shouldn't do,
[2:38:07.960 --> 2:38:13.880]  and that's what adults realize, because children, immature people, foolish people, will do whatever
[2:38:13.880 --> 2:38:17.480]  comes into their foolish heads and say, oh, you know, that's perfectly fine.
[2:38:17.480 --> 2:38:21.800]  You know, yeah, let's see if, you know, let's jump off a 40-story building and see if I
[2:38:21.800 --> 2:38:22.800]  can fly.
[2:38:22.800 --> 2:38:26.600]  You know, I mean, because that's what stupid people do.
[2:38:26.600 --> 2:38:33.480]  People with some sense, some judgment, some, you don't have to be, you know, 160 IQ points.
[2:38:33.480 --> 2:38:40.320]  You can be just average Joe in so far as brain-pan powers concerned, but still have the judgment,
[2:38:40.320 --> 2:38:46.200]  the common sense, the experience to realize, you know, this is, this might be a bad idea.
[2:38:46.200 --> 2:38:47.200]  Don't do it.
[2:38:47.200 --> 2:38:48.200]  Don't do it.
[2:38:48.200 --> 2:38:49.200]  This stuff of reviving pigs, for instance.
[2:38:49.200 --> 2:38:50.200]  It's crazy.
[2:38:50.200 --> 2:38:51.200]  Okay.
[2:38:51.200 --> 2:38:52.200]  Zombie pig attack.
[2:38:52.200 --> 2:38:53.200]  Yeah.
[2:38:53.200 --> 2:38:59.120]  Look, the difference, you know, in terms of physiognomy between a pig and a human being
[2:38:59.120 --> 2:39:00.120]  is very little.
[2:39:00.120 --> 2:39:01.120]  Yes.
[2:39:01.120 --> 2:39:02.120]  Okay.
[2:39:02.120 --> 2:39:08.120]  There is a much greater distance between, say, the physiognomy of a mouse, for instance,
[2:39:08.120 --> 2:39:10.120]  and a pig than a pig and a human being.
[2:39:10.120 --> 2:39:13.440]  So if you can do it to pigs, they'll probably be able to do it to human beings.
[2:39:13.440 --> 2:39:15.440]  Is it something that we want?
[2:39:15.440 --> 2:39:16.440]  Definitely not.
[2:39:16.440 --> 2:39:17.960]  We want them to do this with human beings.
[2:39:17.960 --> 2:39:21.880]  This is being developed to try to preserve organs for transplants.
[2:39:21.880 --> 2:39:28.240]  So folks, someone dies in a car crash, they're dead for an hour or a couple of hours.
[2:39:28.240 --> 2:39:31.800]  I mean, dead, dead, brain dead, no circulation, no oxygen.
[2:39:31.800 --> 2:39:36.600]  They pump them full of this concoction, which I guess would push out some of the vaccine
[2:39:36.600 --> 2:39:37.600]  clots.
[2:39:37.600 --> 2:39:42.200]  Probably there'd be like clots coming out on one side, the zombie concoction.
[2:39:42.200 --> 2:39:43.840]  Go right, right.
[2:39:43.840 --> 2:39:45.300]  They get the clots out of there.
[2:39:45.300 --> 2:39:50.240]  They get the concoction in there, the organs come back to life, then they kill the person
[2:39:50.240 --> 2:39:56.960]  a second time to harvest the organs to put them in to some recipient so that the hospital
[2:39:56.960 --> 2:40:02.920]  can bill half a million dollars for an organ transplant and bill that to Medicare or Medicaid.
[2:40:02.920 --> 2:40:08.080]  They're making money, they zombify the organs, and then the recipient has like a zombie heart
[2:40:08.080 --> 2:40:09.080]  or something.
[2:40:09.080 --> 2:40:11.640]  Like this is medical science now, really?
[2:40:11.640 --> 2:40:15.440]  Yeah, like I said, just because you can do something doesn't mean that you should do
[2:40:15.440 --> 2:40:16.440]  something.
[2:40:16.440 --> 2:40:20.560]  I mean, look, you are in a decent living, so do I, right?
[2:40:20.560 --> 2:40:26.080]  I know that I have the money that I can go and buy, I don't know, a kilo of heroin and
[2:40:26.080 --> 2:40:27.920]  inject myself with it.
[2:40:27.920 --> 2:40:28.920]  Should I do that?
[2:40:28.920 --> 2:40:29.920]  Of course not.
[2:40:29.920 --> 2:40:32.240]  You would be insane, okay?
[2:40:32.240 --> 2:40:34.880]  And so the same applies here.
[2:40:34.880 --> 2:40:39.920]  And I insist, you have to sometimes let sleeping dogs lie.
[2:40:39.920 --> 2:40:44.000]  Because just because you can do something doesn't mean that you should do that thing.
[2:40:44.000 --> 2:40:49.320]  And sometimes, even with the best of intentions, you have to realize that if you don't know
[2:40:49.320 --> 2:40:52.600]  all of the information, the consequences can be catastrophic.
[2:40:52.600 --> 2:40:57.200]  Look, and so far as the vaccine for COVID is concerned, right?
[2:40:57.200 --> 2:41:03.080]  When I first heard about the story back in November, December of 2020, I thought, this
[2:41:03.080 --> 2:41:06.120]  is crazy, because anything can happen, okay?
[2:41:06.120 --> 2:41:09.240]  You need years to test this stuff, okay?
[2:41:09.240 --> 2:41:10.680]  And I always thought of thalidomide.
[2:41:10.680 --> 2:41:13.920]  Thalidomide was a drug developed in West Germany.
[2:41:13.920 --> 2:41:18.160]  It was used as a tranquilizer and was prescribed to pregnant women.
[2:41:18.160 --> 2:41:21.880]  And pregnant women who took it during certain weeks of their pregnancy, it wasn't during
[2:41:21.880 --> 2:41:25.520]  the entire pregnancy, it was just a few weeks, just a few crucial weeks.
[2:41:25.520 --> 2:41:31.560]  Well, they either lost their babies or in other cases, tragically, the babies were
[2:41:31.560 --> 2:41:37.560]  born without, their arms were little stumps or their arms and legs were little stumps,
[2:41:37.560 --> 2:41:38.560]  you know?
[2:41:38.560 --> 2:41:39.560]  It was a tragedy.
[2:41:39.560 --> 2:41:41.440]  It was horrible, right?
[2:41:41.440 --> 2:41:46.560]  And these poor children, you're seeing it on screen now, these poor children suffering
[2:41:46.560 --> 2:41:50.560]  because of a drug that was not tested properly, okay?
[2:41:50.560 --> 2:41:51.560]  And that was just one drug.
[2:41:51.560 --> 2:41:56.000]  And we've known this for 60 years, because this happened in the late 50s, early 60s,
[2:41:56.000 --> 2:41:57.000]  right?
[2:41:57.000 --> 2:42:01.120]  And it still took them five years to realize what had happened, because they were getting
[2:42:01.120 --> 2:42:04.400]  these babies with these deformities and they didn't really know.
[2:42:04.400 --> 2:42:09.120]  It wasn't like these children came out with a holding a little paper saying, Philip, I
[2:42:09.120 --> 2:42:10.120]  did this, okay?
[2:42:10.120 --> 2:42:11.120]  They had to figure it out.
[2:42:11.120 --> 2:42:12.120]  It took time.
[2:42:12.120 --> 2:42:14.880]  It took a lot of research and investigation.
[2:42:14.880 --> 2:42:20.240]  And so by the same token, you should never put out some drug without testing it for years
[2:42:20.240 --> 2:42:21.240]  and years.
[2:42:21.240 --> 2:42:22.240]  Amen.
[2:42:22.240 --> 2:42:26.320]  And on top of that, it went against their own science that you never put out a vaccine
[2:42:26.320 --> 2:42:28.400]  in the middle of a pandemic.
[2:42:28.400 --> 2:42:31.080]  These people were anti-science because they were panicking.
[2:42:31.080 --> 2:42:32.080]  Hold on.
[2:42:32.080 --> 2:42:33.080]  I apologize again.
[2:42:33.080 --> 2:42:36.560]  I've got to say one thing, and please stay one more segment.
[2:42:36.560 --> 2:42:40.280]  When we come back after this coming break, I'm going to break some bombshell news about
[2:42:40.280 --> 2:42:45.720]  how we solve Western Europe's energy problem, because there's been a new breakthrough announcement
[2:42:45.720 --> 2:42:52.280]  and demonstration in Texas of an energy technology that you're going to want to hear about.
[2:42:52.280 --> 2:42:53.280]  We'll have that on the other side.
[2:42:53.280 --> 2:42:57.040]  Stay with us here on the Alex Jones Show.
[2:42:57.040 --> 2:43:01.160]  The great reset in the war for the world is the book that the government doesn't want
[2:43:01.160 --> 2:43:06.120]  you to read that most of the big, powerful companies trying to control your life, the
[2:43:06.120 --> 2:43:09.520]  big tech companies, they don't want you to read this book.
[2:43:09.520 --> 2:43:14.160]  They want to control what you think, what you do, what you read, but you don't want
[2:43:14.160 --> 2:43:15.160]  that.
[2:43:15.160 --> 2:43:16.360]  And Alex Jones doesn't want that.
[2:43:16.360 --> 2:43:21.040]  And this book shows you what's happening and gives you the sort of playbook for how to
[2:43:21.040 --> 2:43:22.160]  fight against it.
[2:43:22.160 --> 2:43:26.640]  And so by buying this book, you're going to prove that censorship doesn't work, that
[2:43:26.640 --> 2:43:28.800]  freedom is alive in this country.
[2:43:28.800 --> 2:43:34.320]  This is a central reading and, you know, I would go right now and buy it before the censorship
[2:43:34.320 --> 2:43:35.480]  kicks in.
[2:43:35.480 --> 2:43:37.720]  It's not going to be available in bookstores.
[2:43:37.720 --> 2:43:39.920]  It's not going to be available in libraries.
[2:43:39.920 --> 2:43:44.000]  They're going to try to take it down from every platform that they can, but they're not going
[2:43:44.000 --> 2:43:48.520]  to be able to do it, prove that censorship doesn't work by the great reset.
[2:43:48.520 --> 2:43:49.520]  Thank you, Alex Jones.
[2:43:49.520 --> 2:43:53.680]  I really appreciate you having me on and I appreciate you writing this book and getting
[2:43:53.680 --> 2:44:00.200]  the information out there, seven months ago in December of 2021, we launched the first

[2:45:03.200 --> 2:45:08.360]  and listen, there are hundreds of them out there that work, but most of them do it in
[2:45:08.360 --> 2:45:09.360]  a toxic way.
[2:45:09.360 --> 2:45:14.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, we went out and did deep research on the safest, healthiest ways

[2:46:57.840 --> 2:47:13.520]  Pleading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:47:13.520 --> 2:47:18.800]  All right hold on to your hats folks, we've got some major breaking news to share with
[2:47:18.800 --> 2:47:23.920]  you here that can help solve the world's energy problems and we also have Gonzalo Lira
[2:47:23.920 --> 2:47:28.520]  who's with us for this one more segment and then Alex Jones and Robert Barnes come in
[2:47:28.520 --> 2:47:31.440]  for the fourth hour and I want to thank Gonzalo for staying with us.
[2:47:31.440 --> 2:47:37.640]  But first folks, the great reset, the new book by Alex Jones, the reason why it's important
[2:47:37.640 --> 2:47:44.640]  to go online and pre-order this book Amazon.com or Barnes and Noble, you know, BN.com is because
[2:47:44.640 --> 2:47:49.280]  the more people buy it, the higher it moves up the list of best sellers and the harder
[2:47:49.280 --> 2:47:51.120]  it is for the establishment to ignore.
[2:47:51.120 --> 2:47:55.920]  But I mean that's the whole reason, trust me, authors don't make hardly any money off
[2:47:55.920 --> 2:48:01.720]  of books, this is not at all about making money, it's about sending a message and Sky
[2:48:01.720 --> 2:48:05.320]  Horse Publishing is the publisher behind this book, they're a fantastic company, they also
[2:48:05.320 --> 2:48:10.520]  published The Real Anthony Fauci by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and many other books by the
[2:48:10.520 --> 2:48:14.000]  way including books by you know Attorney Alan Dershowitz and many others.
[2:48:14.000 --> 2:48:22.280]  So check it out, the great reset by Alex Jones, purchase it as a vote for freedom, frankly,
[2:48:22.280 --> 2:48:23.600]  that's really what this is about.
[2:48:23.600 --> 2:48:28.640]  Now the big news I want to share with you and I want to get Gonzalo's reaction to this,
[2:48:28.640 --> 2:48:35.240]  I had originally scheduled a guest for this hour whom I asked to reschedule so he will
[2:48:35.240 --> 2:48:42.040]  come back but we were going to talk about this major breaking news and it involves a technology
[2:48:42.040 --> 2:48:48.880]  called low energy nuclear reactions which is a solid state heat generating system.
[2:48:48.880 --> 2:48:56.080]  Now in the early early days, 1989, it used to be called cold fusion and it was downplayed
[2:48:56.080 --> 2:48:58.440]  by the physics community, they said that's impossible.
[2:48:58.440 --> 2:49:03.040]  Well, not impossible, it's been replicated by the United States Navy and laboratories
[2:49:03.040 --> 2:49:08.360]  in Japan and in Russia and all over the world, well there's a company in America now called
[2:49:08.360 --> 2:49:15.840]  Brillouin Energy and they have now demonstrated this in a live demonstration at a conference
[2:49:15.840 --> 2:49:20.680]  that just took place in California about, I think it was a week ago or roughly that,
[2:49:20.680 --> 2:49:25.800]  they're also setting up a demonstration I think at Rice University in Houston, Texas
[2:49:25.800 --> 2:49:30.920]  that is coming up where you'll be able to see a sterling engine operating off of a solid
[2:49:30.920 --> 2:49:35.120]  state low energy nuclear reaction technology system.
[2:49:35.120 --> 2:49:39.440]  And the way the system operates, and I will go to you Gonzalo, thank you for your patience,
[2:49:39.440 --> 2:49:45.120]  but the way the system operates is it takes an input, let's say a thousand watts of electricity
[2:49:45.120 --> 2:49:50.760]  but it produces a multiple of that in terms of excess heat, for example the current ratio
[2:49:50.760 --> 2:49:57.680]  is 2.7, so a thousand watts coming in you get 2,700 watts of heat and this heat can be used
[2:49:57.680 --> 2:50:02.360]  to just directly heat buildings, I can think of some European countries that might be interested
[2:50:02.360 --> 2:50:07.680]  in that real soon, or you can heat water with it, you can then turn the water into steam
[2:50:07.680 --> 2:50:12.880]  and drive a turbine, i.e. you can ultimately replace fuel rods in nuclear power plants
[2:50:12.880 --> 2:50:18.000]  with this technology, I mean it's gonna take some engineering and more years but the tech
[2:50:18.000 --> 2:50:22.920]  exists, that's the thing, you can heat buildings, you can generate electricity and you can do
[2:50:22.920 --> 2:50:31.240]  it in a green, even an eco-friendly way because it produces no emissions, not carbon, nothing,
[2:50:31.240 --> 2:50:36.560]  not even the normal radioactive waste, so with that in mind folks, I mean again it's called
[2:50:36.560 --> 2:50:41.920]  Low Energy Nuclear Reactions, LE&R, we'll have a guest on sometime soon to speak in
[2:50:41.920 --> 2:50:48.120]  more detail about that, but Gonzalo, my question to you on this is, this is just a great example
[2:50:48.120 --> 2:50:53.280]  because this technology has been suppressed, suppressed, suppressed for decades.
[2:50:53.280 --> 2:50:54.360]  I don't buy it.
[2:50:54.360 --> 2:50:55.360]  You don't buy it?
[2:50:55.360 --> 2:51:00.480]  Sorry, not at all, I could say almost positively that it's some sort of scam.
[2:51:00.480 --> 2:51:06.600]  Well, this is why I love to have you on Gonzalo because you're a thinking person, you reach
[2:51:06.600 --> 2:51:13.360]  your own conclusions, I've done diligence on this but I definitely wanna hear your thoughts,
[2:51:13.360 --> 2:51:14.360]  go ahead.
[2:51:14.360 --> 2:51:19.000]  Sure, back in 89 it was or 87 something like that, I don't quite remember the year but
[2:51:19.000 --> 2:51:25.000]  on Time Magazine, the cover of Time Magazine, there was this big picture of like some scientists
[2:51:25.000 --> 2:51:30.120]  who had come up with some cold fusion technology, it was like a little beaker with a couple
[2:51:30.120 --> 2:51:36.640]  of electrodes in it, I mean I don't have it handy, I was not prepared for this particular
[2:51:36.640 --> 2:51:42.240]  topic but I remember that even Time Magazine back in 89 got bamboozled by this because
[2:51:42.240 --> 2:51:47.440]  later it turned out to be just nonsense, it's just a fake, just a big scam, okay?
[2:51:47.440 --> 2:51:52.480]  And this notion that you'll have some solid state, I don't know if it was that, no, it
[2:51:52.480 --> 2:51:57.600]  was on the cover of Time Magazine but anyway, the point I'm trying to make is that, I've
[2:51:57.600 --> 2:52:05.240]  heard this for years, for decades at this point, okay, I don't buy, I mean if I'm wrong
[2:52:05.240 --> 2:52:10.640]  I'll be the first to say that I was wrong, if I'm proven wrong but just like a story
[2:52:10.640 --> 2:52:15.960]  like this, I think it's baloney, I just prove my foxy because I've heard this like I said
[2:52:15.960 --> 2:52:16.960]  for decades.
[2:52:16.960 --> 2:52:17.960]  Right, right.
[2:52:17.960 --> 2:52:21.360]  And see this particular nut to crack, right?
[2:52:21.360 --> 2:52:25.840]  A lot of people want to crack it because it represents a great deal of money, okay?
[2:52:25.840 --> 2:52:30.080]  Even to the people of the regime, right, that one, that's the cover that you're seeing
[2:52:30.080 --> 2:52:34.960]  on your screen now, Fusion or Illusion, yeah, Time Magazine, I remember reading that Time
[2:52:34.960 --> 2:52:38.560]  Magazine and they were all in favor, they thought it was the next day, it turned out
[2:52:38.560 --> 2:52:39.560]  to be nonsense.
[2:52:39.560 --> 2:52:47.200]  Well, you're referring to Fleischmann and Ponds, University of Salt Lake, Utah, 1989?
[2:52:47.200 --> 2:52:51.360]  That would be made from this and so a lot of companies would most definitely want to be
[2:52:51.360 --> 2:52:54.840]  involved in this business if it were an actual business, okay?
[2:52:54.840 --> 2:52:57.880]  And so this notion that there's a big cabal that they would be suppressing it because
[2:52:57.880 --> 2:53:04.640]  of the oil companies or something like that, there would be to be made by having this technology
[2:53:04.640 --> 2:53:05.640]  than the oil companies.
[2:53:05.640 --> 2:53:12.000]  The oil companies would become small bananas compared to a fusion system that actually
[2:53:12.000 --> 2:53:13.000]  worked, okay?
[2:53:13.000 --> 2:53:19.560]  And so that's why I hear these stories periodically, I don't buy them and if I'm wrong, I'll be
[2:53:19.560 --> 2:53:20.560]  the first to say so.
[2:53:20.560 --> 2:53:26.080]  Well, I should, I mean, I should apologize, I kind of, I didn't mention I was going to
[2:53:26.080 --> 2:53:32.200]  bring this up at all, so we didn't talk about this beforehand, but...
[2:53:32.200 --> 2:53:38.760]  The thing is, as far as I'm concerned, the only thing that I can do is say exactly what
[2:53:38.760 --> 2:53:42.240]  I think and let the chips fall where they may because I've always thought that it's
[2:53:42.240 --> 2:53:44.120]  easier to live that way.
[2:53:44.120 --> 2:53:50.680]  It's easier to say yes or no or whatever because when I genuinely believe something, it's genuine.
[2:53:50.680 --> 2:53:51.680]  I'm not faking it, okay?
[2:53:51.680 --> 2:53:55.600]  Well, that's what's beautiful about this process that the public is observing.
[2:53:55.600 --> 2:54:01.760]  I mean, here are you, you and I talking about a subject that we did not prearrange.
[2:54:01.760 --> 2:54:08.160]  We have different sets of information about what this is and you are saying, you know,
[2:54:08.160 --> 2:54:13.080]  right now, publicly, as with any topic, that if new information emerges that comes to your
[2:54:13.080 --> 2:54:16.000]  awareness, you're happy to reevaluate it and I am as well.
[2:54:16.000 --> 2:54:17.800]  I am as well.
[2:54:17.800 --> 2:54:23.760]  What I can say, I've been monitoring this for many, many years and this is in alignment
[2:54:23.760 --> 2:54:24.920]  with the laws of physics.
[2:54:24.920 --> 2:54:30.480]  There's a slight loss of mass and a large increase in excess energy and a little bit
[2:54:30.480 --> 2:54:33.520]  of helium produced as a byproduct.
[2:54:33.520 --> 2:54:38.480]  I believe this is a very real thing and it's been licensed to some boiler companies who
[2:54:38.480 --> 2:54:41.480]  are going to use it to help heat hot water for distribution and systems.
[2:54:41.480 --> 2:54:44.960]  But I think it's not a super miracle like it's not going to solve the world's energy
[2:54:44.960 --> 2:54:46.880]  problems overnight.
[2:54:46.880 --> 2:54:47.880]  But this is something-
[2:54:47.880 --> 2:54:53.440]  Right there when you mentioned that it produces a little excess helium.
[2:54:53.440 --> 2:54:58.080]  Right there I know that something's hinky going on because helium is noble gas.
[2:54:58.080 --> 2:54:59.480]  It's two electrons.
[2:54:59.480 --> 2:55:01.160]  It can't bind with anything.
[2:55:01.160 --> 2:55:02.720]  That's why it's noble gas.
[2:55:02.720 --> 2:55:09.280]  And so helium can only be produced by a fusion reaction like what happens in the sun and
[2:55:09.280 --> 2:55:17.360]  other certain geological processes that take millennia literally to conclude and perhaps
[2:55:17.360 --> 2:55:18.360]  even more.
[2:55:18.360 --> 2:55:20.320]  I'm fuzzy on the geology.
[2:55:20.320 --> 2:55:23.600]  I read it back when I was in college 25 odd years ago.
[2:55:23.600 --> 2:55:32.680]  And so the thing is, there is no industrial process whereby helium is produced as a byproduct.
[2:55:32.680 --> 2:55:36.560]  And so right there, I'm like, it doesn't sound real.
[2:55:36.560 --> 2:55:37.560]  Well, it's-
[2:55:37.560 --> 2:55:42.560]  No, I hear you and I appreciate your forthrightness.
[2:55:42.560 --> 2:55:48.880]  I think this proves that when you speak, you are always speaking from your heart and from
[2:55:48.880 --> 2:55:53.840]  a perspective of truth and not, you're not going to just go along with something just
[2:55:53.840 --> 2:55:55.840]  because it's popular or whatever.
[2:55:55.840 --> 2:55:56.840]  You're going to say what you believe.
[2:55:56.840 --> 2:56:05.640]  You see, Mike, I respect you enough that I think, see, if I didn't respect you, I'd
[2:56:05.640 --> 2:56:07.040]  be like, oh, yeah, sure.
[2:56:07.040 --> 2:56:08.040]  Right.
[2:56:08.040 --> 2:56:09.040]  Right.
[2:56:09.040 --> 2:56:10.040]  Exactly.
[2:56:10.040 --> 2:56:11.040]  Yeah.
[2:56:11.040 --> 2:56:13.480]  When you're dealing with somebody whom you don't respect, what, you're going to argue
[2:56:13.480 --> 2:56:14.480]  with them?
[2:56:14.480 --> 2:56:15.480]  No, you're not going to waste your time with them.
[2:56:15.480 --> 2:56:20.560]  And if they say, I don't know, that the moon is made of green cheese or something, something
[2:56:20.560 --> 2:56:25.600]  absurd, you just say, okay, fine, yeah, because you don't respect them.
[2:56:25.600 --> 2:56:26.600]  You don't care about them.
[2:56:26.600 --> 2:56:31.520]  And if you do care about somebody and you respect them, then you say, no, I disagree
[2:56:31.520 --> 2:56:32.520]  with you.
[2:56:32.520 --> 2:56:33.840]  You know, and it's perfectly fine.
[2:56:33.840 --> 2:56:38.880]  I know why we have this action that we cannot disagree and still remain friends.
[2:56:38.880 --> 2:56:39.880]  Right.
[2:56:39.880 --> 2:56:40.880]  That's what's beautiful about this.
[2:56:40.880 --> 2:56:45.640]  And I respect you and your intelligence and your views and your knowledge on so many issues.
[2:56:45.640 --> 2:56:52.040]  And actually, the whole reason I brought this up was what if Western Europe, actually there
[2:56:52.040 --> 2:56:57.320]  is some other solution other than hydrocarbons or reverting to nuclear because Germany is
[2:56:57.320 --> 2:57:01.400]  going back to like, let's turn on the nuclear power plants again, which is interesting because
[2:57:01.400 --> 2:57:05.880]  they want to shut them all down because of, you know, the green energy situation, but
[2:57:05.880 --> 2:57:08.200]  then they don't want hydrocarbons.
[2:57:08.200 --> 2:57:14.040]  And then my knowledge is that this technology has been intentionally suppressed for all
[2:57:14.040 --> 2:57:15.040]  these years.
[2:57:15.040 --> 2:57:16.560]  What if it can be commercialized?
[2:57:16.560 --> 2:57:18.280]  Then we have another alternative.
[2:57:18.280 --> 2:57:24.680]  I mean, like, look, stuff has to pass the smell test, you know, when you make a turkey,
[2:57:24.680 --> 2:57:28.600]  you always want to want to smell it good before you stick it in the oven to make sure it passes
[2:57:28.600 --> 2:57:29.600]  the smell test.
[2:57:29.600 --> 2:57:30.600]  Right.
[2:57:30.600 --> 2:57:33.080]  Well, but we have zombie pigs being brought back from the dead.
[2:57:33.080 --> 2:57:34.080]  Yeah.
[2:57:34.080 --> 2:57:35.080]  See that.
[2:57:35.080 --> 2:57:36.080]  I believe.
[2:57:36.080 --> 2:57:37.080]  Yeah.
[2:57:37.080 --> 2:57:38.080]  Okay.
[2:57:38.080 --> 2:57:41.880]  Because I'm actually up to date and I know more or less that started to cut you off.
[2:57:41.880 --> 2:57:43.880]  I hope you enjoyed the show, folks.
[2:57:43.880 --> 2:57:50.360]  It feels like Alex Jones crazy, he's a conspiracy theory guy, he's a nutcase, he's got these
[2:57:50.360 --> 2:57:53.080]  rants and all that.
[2:57:53.080 --> 2:57:59.760]  What they miss is that this guy's ahead of the curve on so many different topics of signal,
[2:57:59.760 --> 2:58:00.760]  not noise.
[2:58:00.760 --> 2:58:07.000]  If you look at the signal and you compare that to PBS and NPR and BBC and we'll do what
[2:58:07.000 --> 2:58:12.320]  Alex Jones put out there versus what your collective body has put out there.
[2:58:12.320 --> 2:58:15.920]  And if you're a set in a human being and just watching it, you say, well, Alex Jones was
[2:58:15.920 --> 2:58:18.240]  ahead of this, not only that, he kind of explained it.
[2:58:18.240 --> 2:58:21.200]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[2:58:21.200 --> 2:58:22.200]  That is very rare.
[2:58:22.200 --> 2:58:27.120]  You've got to go back almost to the revolutionary generation and see that in this new book.
[2:58:27.120 --> 2:58:31.640]  I got to tell you when Tony Lyons first approached me, I read this thing, I go, this is it.
[2:58:31.640 --> 2:58:32.640]  This is no beetry.
[2:58:32.640 --> 2:58:35.840]  You're not going to be flipping pages or you're going to be having a pin out and you're going
[2:58:35.840 --> 2:58:36.840]  to be underlining stuff.

[2:59:58.680 --> 3:00:00.760]  We are drugs out.
[3:00:00.760 --> 3:00:04.160]  We are following other people's opinions.
[3:00:04.160 --> 3:00:06.680]  We are controlled by the media.
[3:00:06.680 --> 3:00:08.880]  Today it all changes.
[3:00:08.880 --> 3:00:11.560]  This reality has been forced upon us.
[3:00:11.560 --> 3:00:14.520]  It is a choice just like when I said slavery is a choice.
[3:00:14.520 --> 3:00:19.400]  Einstein says the depth of insanity is doing the same thing, expecting a different result.
[3:00:19.400 --> 3:00:20.400]  So we keep on saying, I hate you.

[3:00:38.560 --> 3:00:39.560]  I hate you.
[3:00:39.560 --> 3:00:40.560]  I hate you.
[3:00:40.560 --> 3:00:41.560]  I hate you.
[3:00:41.560 --> 3:00:42.560]  I hate you.
[3:00:42.560 --> 3:00:43.560]  I hate you.
[3:00:43.560 --> 3:00:44.560]  I hate you.
[3:00:44.560 --> 3:00:45.560]  I hate you.
[3:00:45.560 --> 3:00:46.560]  I hate you.
[3:00:46.560 --> 3:00:47.560]  I hate you and I hate you.
[3:00:47.560 --> 3:00:48.560]  I hate you.
[3:00:48.560 --> 3:00:49.560]  I hate you.
[3:00:49.560 --> 3:00:50.560]  I hate you.
[3:00:50.560 --> 3:00:51.560]  I hate you.
[3:00:51.560 --> 3:00:52.680]  I hate you.
[3:00:52.680 --> 3:00:53.680]  I hate you.
[3:00:53.680 --> 3:00:54.680]  I hate you.
[3:00:54.680 --> 3:00:55.680]  I hate you.
[3:00:55.680 --> 3:00:56.680]  I hate you.
[3:00:56.680 --> 3:00:57.680]  I hate you.
[3:00:57.680 --> 3:00:58.680]  I hate you.
[3:00:58.680 --> 3:00:59.680]  I hate you.
[3:00:59.680 --> 3:01:06.000]  Well, the Bill of Rights is a stumbling block on the way to shutting down speech that the
[3:01:06.000 --> 3:01:08.880]  left doesn't like, at least in government.
[3:01:08.880 --> 3:01:13.240]  But there's a new avenue for those who would like to censor what you say and think, and
[3:01:13.240 --> 3:01:14.240]  that's corporations.
[3:01:14.240 --> 3:01:16.920]  The left have wised up to this.
[3:01:16.920 --> 3:01:22.320]  If you want to stop someone from telling the truth, use companies to do it.
[3:01:22.320 --> 3:01:23.320]  The social media giants.
[3:01:23.320 --> 3:01:24.320]  And they are.
[3:01:24.320 --> 3:01:29.240]  For many on the left, the view seems to have become that if you can't beat them, prevent
[3:01:29.240 --> 3:01:30.240]  them from speaking.
[3:01:30.240 --> 3:01:33.320]  So far, the most prominent casualty of the crusade against free expression has been
[3:01:33.320 --> 3:01:35.080]  the radio show host Alex Jones.
[3:01:35.080 --> 3:01:39.040]  There is a concerted effort by the Democratic Party and multinational corporations in Big
[3:01:39.040 --> 3:01:42.840]  Tech to silence conservative and nationalist and populist voices.
[3:01:42.840 --> 3:01:47.480]  There's also guys on CNN that spend their whole day calling Facebook and saying, can
[3:01:47.480 --> 3:01:48.840]  you ban this person?
[3:01:48.840 --> 3:01:54.160]  He may be America's best known conspiracy theorist, but this week, Alex Jones' content
[3:01:54.160 --> 3:01:55.880]  will be a little harder to find.
[3:01:55.880 --> 3:02:00.160]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment, but instead
[3:02:00.160 --> 3:02:05.040]  attack dogging, calling for federal regulators to shut down independent, free press, working
[3:02:05.040 --> 3:02:06.480]  with Big Tech.
[3:02:06.480 --> 3:02:07.800]  People know what's true.
[3:02:07.800 --> 3:02:09.400]  They can smell it.
[3:02:09.400 --> 3:02:13.920]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[3:02:13.920 --> 3:02:16.960]  In a free country, everyone can be heard.
[3:02:16.960 --> 3:02:21.800]  Into talentarian societies, only the powerful can be heard.
[3:02:21.800 --> 3:02:22.800]  I want them shut down.
[3:02:22.800 --> 3:02:23.800]  I want them silenced.
[3:02:23.800 --> 3:02:24.800]  I want them muted.
[3:02:24.800 --> 3:02:26.800]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[3:02:26.800 --> 3:02:27.800]  Spanning people.
[3:02:27.800 --> 3:02:33.120]  They're dictating the opinions that everyone on the platform is allowed to have, merely
[3:02:33.120 --> 3:02:34.120]  a...
[3:02:34.120 --> 3:02:44.320]  I'm a conservative Jew, so I guess that makes me such a dangerous person.
[3:02:44.320 --> 3:02:47.120]  Spreading articles, spreading videos, spreading links, you're going to get demonized, you're
[3:02:47.120 --> 3:02:51.440]  going to get attacked.
[3:02:51.440 --> 3:02:54.720]  It's going to do something terrible like help Trump get reelected.
[3:02:54.720 --> 3:02:56.720]  It's really what all this is about.
[3:02:56.720 --> 3:03:06.000]  Say it, that they deem our content and our brand unsafe.
[3:03:06.000 --> 3:03:09.120]  Is the right to be, do, and say whatever you want.
[3:03:09.120 --> 3:03:11.120]  It's about freedom of expression.
[3:03:11.120 --> 3:03:16.680]  On the journalists, I'm a lap not interested in telling the truth about me, because I don't
[3:03:16.680 --> 3:03:17.680]  fit the stereotype.
[3:03:17.680 --> 3:03:23.560]  They can say whatever they think, and I respect their constitutional right to do it.
[3:03:23.560 --> 3:03:25.560]  And I hope they respect my country.
[3:03:25.560 --> 3:03:48.560]  If you are receiving this transition, you are the resistance.
[3:03:48.560 --> 3:03:58.280]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda, and with spiritual warfare, and with poisons
[3:03:58.280 --> 3:04:01.280]  and chemicals added to the food, it's all come out.
[3:04:01.280 --> 3:04:05.400]  And they're doing that not because we're weak, but because we're made the image of God, the
[3:04:05.400 --> 3:04:08.400]  Creator, and we are powerful.
[3:04:08.400 --> 3:04:11.600]  And the social engineers fear that so much.
[3:04:11.600 --> 3:04:15.440]  So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up
[3:04:15.440 --> 3:04:19.240]  with the boy, is it true?
[3:04:19.240 --> 3:04:25.080]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[3:04:25.080 --> 3:04:28.880]  They need all their propaganda, and all their lies, and all their evil, and all their cultural
[3:04:28.880 --> 3:04:35.360]  death, because they know we are strong, and they know in the end they signed on to the
[3:04:35.360 --> 3:04:37.360]  God of this world, who is a loser.
[3:04:37.360 --> 3:04:41.000]  And that's why it's so important that everybody keep them full wars in the air now more than
[3:04:41.000 --> 3:04:45.240]  ever, because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalists are manifesting
[3:04:45.240 --> 3:04:50.200]  and setting up is satanic, and we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the
[3:04:50.200 --> 3:04:56.320]  beast they just announced.
[3:04:56.320 --> 3:05:01.680]  The globalists are fighting around the clock to destroy the family, to destroy heterosexual
[3:05:01.680 --> 3:05:06.280]  relationships, to annihilate our marriages, and the studies are all clear.
[3:05:06.280 --> 3:05:12.680]  The number one cause of marital splits is that there is problems in the bedroom, and
[3:05:12.680 --> 3:05:16.440]  the number one issue men have is erectile dysfunction.
[3:05:16.440 --> 3:05:20.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, the left makes big jokes about this, because they don't want people
[3:05:20.280 --> 3:05:24.840]  having lasting, good, loving relationships, they want to break up society, and we are
[3:05:24.840 --> 3:05:32.040]  so excited to have the number one natural male enhancement pill in the world available
[3:05:32.040 --> 3:05:33.800]  as a major sponsor now.

[3:05:40.680 --> 3:05:43.680]  the science yourself, and then get a bottle of InstaHeart.

[3:05:47.680 --> 3:05:49.120]  have problems in the bedroom.
[3:05:49.120 --> 3:06:01.520]  This also enhances it, so again, get yours today at theironpatriot.com.
[3:06:01.520 --> 3:06:07.640]  One of the things you've been talking about on your show is your allegation that government
[3:06:07.640 --> 3:06:13.640]  officials are aiding in pedophilia, child trafficking, and the grooming of children, right?
[3:06:13.640 --> 3:06:16.640]  What do you mean, like, whatever Epstein did with the clums?
[3:06:16.640 --> 3:06:17.640]  Oh!
[3:06:17.640 --> 3:06:18.640]  Oh!
[3:06:18.640 --> 3:06:19.640]  Oh!
[3:06:19.640 --> 3:06:20.640]  Oh my God!
[3:06:20.640 --> 3:06:21.640]  Oh my God!
[3:06:21.640 --> 3:06:22.640]  Oh my God!
[3:06:22.640 --> 3:06:23.640]  Oh my God!
[3:06:23.640 --> 3:06:24.640]  Oh my God!
[3:06:24.640 --> 3:06:25.640]  Oh my God!
[3:06:25.640 --> 3:06:26.640]  Oh my God!
[3:06:26.640 --> 3:06:27.640]  Oh my God!
[3:06:27.640 --> 3:06:28.640]  Oh my God!
[3:06:28.640 --> 3:06:29.640]  Oh my God!
[3:06:29.640 --> 3:06:30.640]  Oh my God!
[3:06:30.640 --> 3:06:31.640]  Oh my God!
[3:06:31.640 --> 3:06:38.640]  It's your allegation that government officials are aiding in pedophilia, child trafficking,
[3:06:38.640 --> 3:06:41.640]  and the grooming of children, right?
[3:06:41.640 --> 3:06:45.640]  What do you mean, like, whatever Epstein did with the clums?
[3:06:45.640 --> 3:06:50.640]  Oh my God!
[3:07:15.640 --> 3:07:25.640]  Oh my God!
[3:07:45.640 --> 3:07:55.640]  Oh my God!
[3:08:15.640 --> 3:08:25.640]  Oh my God!
[3:08:45.640 --> 3:08:51.640]  After all the hype, Germany's dependence on fossil fuel is at 76 percent.
[3:08:51.640 --> 3:08:55.640]  So they are temporarily switching back to coal and oil.
[3:08:55.640 --> 3:09:02.640]  But that's a real problem because they've neglected their own fuel industry and become dependent upon Russia's.
[3:09:02.640 --> 3:09:08.640]  And the German government would rather have the country freeze to death than buy fuel from Russia.
[3:09:08.640 --> 3:09:16.640]  The German economy is based on highly innovative production, which requires a great deal of energy that they no longer produce.
[3:09:16.640 --> 3:09:27.640]  And so running out of fuel will quickly collapse the German economy, which will cause a tsunami of economic destruction throughout the EU and the world.
[3:09:27.640 --> 3:09:30.640]  And the German government is letting it happen.
[3:09:30.640 --> 3:09:38.640]  They could leave some nuclear plants online, but they still plan on shutting it all down by the end of this year to stay green.
[3:09:38.640 --> 3:09:45.640]  Some anti-carbon environmentalists are saying that nuclear power is the greenest option.
[3:09:45.640 --> 3:09:48.640]  And maybe that's true, but none of their schemes add up.
[3:09:48.640 --> 3:09:58.640]  So far, the green agenda has only successfully accomplished making people feel good about themselves while they destroy their own society.
[3:09:58.640 --> 3:10:08.640]  The EU and Britain are actually reverting back to burning wood as fuel and claim that it is carbon neutral, which is a lie.
[3:10:08.640 --> 3:10:19.640]  Societies have steadily evolved towards a cleaner, more efficient energy, starting from wood, the least clean and efficient, and moving to coal, followed by oil and gas.
[3:10:19.640 --> 3:10:29.640]  And now nearly 40% of Europe's renewable energy is wood, which mostly comes from clear-cutting forests in the United States.
[3:10:29.640 --> 3:10:37.640]  This new green deal is a complete lie. It's just another part of the creepy elite's great reset.
[3:10:37.640 --> 3:10:48.640]  These elite bloodlines want a new cashless society, but one more like the Middle Ages, which for these spoiled inbreds, is the good old days.
[3:10:48.640 --> 3:10:52.640]  And if they succeed, it looks like Germany will get there first.
[3:10:52.640 --> 3:11:08.640]  And in the midst of all this chaos, the German government is focused on allowing children age 14 and older to change their gender and first names without parental permission once a year for as often as they want.
[3:11:08.640 --> 3:11:26.640]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Rees.
[3:11:26.640 --> 3:11:42.640]  I feel like this all the time trying to politically awaken people that they're being lied to, that there's an agenda that's not left or right. It's, hey, there's mind control going on. The signals broadcast 24 hours a day through all this media just become aware of it, and they'll say there's nothing going on.
[3:11:42.640 --> 3:11:52.640]  And I want to say, put on these glasses or start chewing concrete.
[3:11:52.640 --> 3:12:03.640]  They have taken the hearts and minds of our leaders. They have recruited the rich and the powerful, and they have blinded us to the truth.
[3:12:03.640 --> 3:12:09.640]  The question is, do we all work for central bankers? That's what I want to address to our guests tonight.
[3:12:09.640 --> 3:12:17.640]  Our impulses are being redirected. We are living in an artificially induced state of consciousness that resembles sleep.
[3:12:17.640 --> 3:12:24.640]  An estimated 50 to 70 million Americans suffer from a sleep disorder or sleep deprivation.
[3:12:24.640 --> 3:12:34.640]  Outside the limit of our sight, feeding on us, pinched on top of us from right to death are our honus.
[3:12:34.640 --> 3:12:41.640]  Latest census numbers prove the United States has the biggest gap between rich and poor compared to all westernized countries today.
[3:12:41.640 --> 3:12:52.640]  Our projections show that by the year 2025, not only America, but the entire planet will be under the protection and the dominion of this power alliance.
[3:12:52.640 --> 3:13:04.640]  The gains have been substantial both for ourselves and for you, the human power elite.
[3:13:04.640 --> 3:13:15.640]  For the first time in all of human history, mankind is politically awakened. That's a total new reality.
[3:13:15.640 --> 3:13:18.640]  I've got one that can see.
[3:13:18.640 --> 3:13:20.640]  We can't be the only ones who can see.
[3:13:20.640 --> 3:13:30.640]  Unfortunately, you've grown up hearing voices that incessantly warn of government as nothing more than some separate sinister entity that's got them at the root of all our problems.
[3:13:30.640 --> 3:13:44.640]  It's a new morning in America. Fresh, vital. The old cynicism is gone. We have faith in our leaders. We're optimistic as to what becomes of it all.
[3:13:44.640 --> 3:13:51.640]  It really boils down to our ability to accept. We don't need pessimism.
[3:13:51.640 --> 3:13:55.640]  I have two words for you. Predator drones.
[3:13:55.640 --> 3:14:00.640]  And who are you, little fella?
[3:14:00.640 --> 3:14:02.640]  You will never see it coming.
[3:14:02.640 --> 3:14:11.640]  Don't predict it. The first guy who uses a Second Amendment weapon to bring a drone down that's been hovering over his house is going to be a folk hero in this picture.
[3:14:11.640 --> 3:14:13.640]  Nice.
[3:14:13.640 --> 3:14:19.640]  And there is a signal broadcast every second of every day through our television sets.
[3:14:19.640 --> 3:14:25.640]  I'm just trying to warn you, folks. The television is a giant LED weapon system.
[3:14:25.640 --> 3:14:33.640]  It's so advanced. They got a monkey farm in Bastrop, folks. They do all sorts of testing on Great Apes, Reese's Monkeys, all nine yards.
[3:14:33.640 --> 3:14:40.640]  And they go, oh, you didn't see this and punch a button into me. Hundreds of monkeys with wires in their brains with television sets brainwashing them.
[3:14:40.640 --> 3:14:47.640]  All I ever have to do is be famous. People watch me. And they love me.
[3:14:47.640 --> 3:14:54.640]  And have a little taste of that good life, too. Now, I know you want it. Hell, everybody does. Do it to your own kind.
[3:14:54.640 --> 3:14:59.640]  What's the threat? We all sell out every day. Might as well be on the winning team.
[3:14:59.640 --> 3:15:08.640]  The real men of the world have to stand up and say, I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass.
[3:15:08.640 --> 3:15:11.640]  And I'm all out of bubblegum.
[3:15:11.640 --> 3:15:19.640]  Time to take a stand, boys. You know what? You got a little courage. Stand up for yourself.
[3:15:19.640 --> 3:15:29.640]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[3:15:29.640 --> 3:15:34.640]  The Oscar winners give a press conference and how to buy a sailboat as...
[3:15:34.640 --> 3:15:43.640]  All live the Republic. Death to the New World. Ladies and gentlemen, come on out.
[3:15:43.640 --> 3:16:00.640]  There is nothing, there is no more epitome of free speech than right here.
[3:16:00.640 --> 3:16:08.640]  And that's what people recognize and resonate with. And as Ward said, you're not going to find a better place for information.
[3:16:08.640 --> 3:16:13.640]  You might not agree with everything. You might not agree with all our perspectives, but we cover all the information.
[3:16:13.640 --> 3:16:17.640]  And there's nowhere else really that does it like we do here. Thank you for that, Ward.
[3:16:17.640 --> 3:16:22.640]  Infowarsstore.com, by the way, the products he mentions, Infowarsstore.com is where to get them, folks.
[3:16:22.640 --> 3:16:29.640]  And we do have the best supplements. I mean, just like we try our best with our news coverage and our information,
[3:16:29.640 --> 3:16:35.640]  we do the best with our supplements as well. I mean, look at the hair and beard support formula.
[3:16:35.640 --> 3:16:39.640]  Folks, this is a joke. I mean, we're giving this thing away. It's 75% off.
[3:16:39.640 --> 3:16:46.640]  By the way, it works for me. In case you haven't noticed, the hair and beard formula is working for me.
[3:16:46.640 --> 3:16:54.640]  Quite well, I might add. Quite well, my barber appreciates hair and beard support for men. I go and see them quite often now.
[3:16:54.640 --> 3:17:00.640]  Infowars has been vindicated. We've been proven right. World government, the New World Order is out of the open.
[3:17:00.640 --> 3:17:06.640]  And now more than ever, the forces of Satan are trying to shut down this broadcast.
[3:17:06.640 --> 3:17:10.640]  The forces of anti-human, godless New World Order are out of control.
[3:17:10.640 --> 3:17:17.640]  So now realize we have pushed them out in the light. We have pushed them out in the open and they are so upset and they are so scared.

[3:18:01.640 --> 3:18:05.640]  Infowars is only about bringing you amazing products that really work.
[3:18:05.640 --> 3:18:10.640]  So we looked at the supplement market that we fund a lot of our operations with, and we said,
[3:18:10.640 --> 3:18:18.640]  what are the best selling natural, healthy, anti-fat weight loss products that are out there? We went and looked at the top 10.
[3:18:18.640 --> 3:18:22.640]  They all had the same ingredients in common that is in this product.
[3:18:22.640 --> 3:18:35.640]  But with our new product from X7, diet force, we got the very best concentrates of these known natural essences that just do amazing things for your body.
[3:18:35.640 --> 3:18:43.640]  So I've lost almost 40 pounds. I'm so a little bit overweight in the last three months, and I've been doing it using diet force and also exercise.
[3:18:43.640 --> 3:18:49.640]  Well, now diet force is exclusively available right now at Infowarsstore.com, 40% off.
[3:18:49.640 --> 3:18:54.640]  Infowarsstore.com, diet force. You need to take this product. It really works.
[3:18:54.640 --> 3:19:02.640]  We are now living in the void, sliding towards collapse in the strange space between what we've known and what's to come.
[3:19:02.640 --> 3:19:15.640]  And right now, the most important thing to remember is, don't panic. Stay calm, because now is the time that we must get our bearings and steer the ship onto a safe sound course.
[3:19:15.640 --> 3:19:22.640]  There is nothing stopping we the people from making our own rules and building our own society.
[3:19:22.640 --> 3:19:28.640]  All we got to do is survive the crash. And right now, we still have time to prepare.
[3:19:28.640 --> 3:19:41.640]  The world fiat currency system is racing towards zero. It's time to convert it into hard assets now, including food, water and survival gear to keep us strong and at the ready.
[3:19:41.640 --> 3:20:06.640]  Go to preparedtoday.com for the essentials, storable foods, water filtration, first aid, power and more at preparedtoday.com.
[3:20:06.640 --> 3:20:20.640]  You thought the lead in winter would bring you down forever, but you rode upon a steamer to the violence of the sun.
[3:20:20.640 --> 3:20:29.640]  Broadcasting live from the UN stronghold, Austin, Texas. You are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:29.640 --> 3:20:38.640]  The colors of the sea, find your eyes with trembling mammoths, and you'll talk to the distant beaches with tales of regularities.
[3:20:38.640 --> 3:20:47.640]  How his naked nears were tortured by the sirens sweetly singing, but the sparkling waves are calling you to kiss the white ladies.
[3:20:47.640 --> 3:20:59.640]  We ran some promos earlier, because for some reason, Robert Mars was sitting around for like an hour waiting to go on air, and he was supposed to be on air, so he left. But he's coming back, we're going to host.
[3:20:59.640 --> 3:21:08.640]  There's so little human communication now, though, like person to person. And that's how the globalists are beating us, is people don't communicate with each other.
[3:21:08.640 --> 3:21:18.640]  It's a shopping mall, or the store, or church, or anywhere, and that's why we're becoming mentally retarded. That's really the fount of all of this.
[3:21:18.640 --> 3:21:26.640]  The epicenter, the progenitor, the patient zero of it. And if you want to be unconscious and die, go ahead.
[3:21:26.640 --> 3:21:34.640]  That's what people are getting Alzheimer's when they're 20 years old now, because they're not making the human connections.
[3:21:34.640 --> 3:21:44.640]  And to watch humanity dying is so sad. I mean, I'm dying too, but it's like Helter Skelter coming down fast but a mile's above you.
[3:21:44.640 --> 3:21:48.640]  I mean, the globalists are trying to break down humanity.
[3:21:48.640 --> 3:21:57.640]  So I had a lot to cover, prepared for hours for this, but you know, we've been sitting around for 20 minutes, sitting there like gorillas knocking our head up against the wall.
[3:21:57.640 --> 3:22:04.640]  It won't matter soon if the food's getting cut off and then it just gets cut off. And I think it's actually a good thing. We've already killed so many kids in the womb.
[3:22:04.640 --> 3:22:10.640]  Let's just start starving everybody to death right out of the oven. That is where we are.
[3:22:10.640 --> 3:22:27.640]  All the wimps that have lived off the system, all the frauds that have hidden behind their BS, it's all over now.
[3:22:27.640 --> 3:22:34.640]  Because you're unconscious, you will die. Because you're living a dream, you will be destroyed.
[3:22:34.640 --> 3:22:43.640]  We don't live in a dream here. I don't live in a fantasy land. I live in the real world.
[3:22:43.640 --> 3:22:49.640]  That's painful to watch.
[3:22:49.640 --> 3:23:00.640]  But nevertheless, everybody's got their own idea of how things work, so you go ahead and do it your way and see what happens.
[3:23:00.640 --> 3:23:13.640]  I have a few video clips I want to play here, and one of them is Dick Cheney, the war criminal, the torture master, the architect of 9-11, the globalist criminal,
[3:23:13.640 --> 3:23:22.640]  the guy that sold America out for the Council on Foreign Relations and made jokes about it on national TV, how he was an enemy of America,
[3:23:22.640 --> 3:23:35.640]  has the nerve to get up and say people running against his daughter in her congressional race are the enemies, and that Trump is the enemy.
[3:23:35.640 --> 3:23:44.640]  Trump's got his set of problems, but he sure as hell isn't evil on purpose, and he's not trying to screw over the American people like Dick Cheney.
[3:23:44.640 --> 3:23:52.640]  And that's why when I saw this early this morning, I woke up at 5 a.m., there was already millions of views of the video and hundreds of thousands of comments,
[3:23:52.640 --> 3:24:00.640]  and I spent five minutes when I got up making my coffee, I only read the first hundred comments or so, saying, we hate you, you're a warmonger,
[3:24:00.640 --> 3:24:08.640]  you're a criminal, you're a liar, you're a globalist, and all these clips of Cheney saying horrible, globalist things.
[3:24:08.640 --> 3:24:19.640]  And I had a real sense of satisfaction and success in that of the five clips I watched of Cheney being dismantled,
[3:24:19.640 --> 3:24:23.640]  three of them were from my films, like Endgame.
[3:24:23.640 --> 3:24:29.640]  I know the music because we got it originally scored by a musician.
[3:24:29.640 --> 3:24:38.640]  And it's just so fun to be 15 years later, see a film I made, and there's a little clip online to counter Cheney, and it's our work.
[3:24:38.640 --> 3:24:43.640]  That's real satisfaction, because you're not getting the credit for it, you just know you did it.
[3:24:43.640 --> 3:24:53.640]  That was wait staying up till midnight, 2 a.m., getting it done, with Graham Reynolds who made this music.
[3:24:53.640 --> 3:24:56.640]  It's just wonderful.
[3:24:56.640 --> 3:25:02.640]  So here's Cheney's minute long, disgusting ad, and here's the real takeaway.
[3:25:02.640 --> 3:25:06.640]  He's universally reviled by conservatives and liberals.
[3:25:06.640 --> 3:25:15.640]  He's known as a fraud, as a Halliburton, Enron scammer, warmongering war criminal.
[3:25:15.640 --> 3:25:24.640]  Hated across the left and right, and he thinks he's coming to the rescue of his daughter that in two weeks or 12 days is gone.
[3:25:24.640 --> 3:25:28.640]  They actually still think they have power.
[3:25:28.640 --> 3:25:30.640]  They actually still think they're in charge.
[3:25:30.640 --> 3:25:39.640]  They actually still think what they say and do has an effect, and that's what's disgusting about it.
[3:25:39.640 --> 3:25:43.640]  But it's also what's funny about it.
[3:25:43.640 --> 3:25:45.640]  The establishment's done.
[3:25:45.640 --> 3:25:48.640]  The only question is, can they take us down with us?
[3:25:48.640 --> 3:25:49.640]  So here's Cheney.
[3:25:49.640 --> 3:25:57.640]  In our nation's 246 year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump.
[3:25:57.640 --> 3:26:04.640]  He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him.
[3:26:04.640 --> 3:26:05.640]  He is a coward.
[3:26:05.640 --> 3:26:07.640]  A real man wouldn't lie to his supporters.
[3:26:07.640 --> 3:26:10.640]  He lost his election, and he lost big.
[3:26:10.640 --> 3:26:11.640]  I know it.
[3:26:11.640 --> 3:26:12.640]  He knows it.
[3:26:12.640 --> 3:26:15.640]  And deep down, I think most republicans know it.
[3:26:15.640 --> 3:26:23.640]  Lynn and I are so proud of Liz for standing up for the truth, doing what's right, honoring her oath to the Constitution.
[3:26:23.640 --> 3:26:27.640]  And so many in our party are too scared to do so.
[3:26:27.640 --> 3:26:28.640]  Liz is fearless.
[3:26:28.640 --> 3:26:30.640]  She never backs down from the fight.
[3:26:30.640 --> 3:26:38.640]  There is nothing more important she will ever do than lead the effort to make sure Donald Trump is never again near the Oval Office.
[3:26:38.640 --> 3:26:40.640]  And she will succeed.
[3:26:40.640 --> 3:26:45.640]  I am Dick Cheney. I proudly voted for my daughter. I hope you will too.
[3:26:45.640 --> 3:26:49.640]  I'm Liz Cheney, and I approve this message.
[3:26:49.640 --> 3:26:58.640]  Back at the Council on Foreign Relations, as Pete mentioned, I've been a member for a long time and was actually a director for some period of time.
[3:26:58.640 --> 3:27:04.640]  I never mentioned that when I was campaigning for re-election back home in Wyoming.
[3:27:04.640 --> 3:27:12.640]  Imagine how dumb you think he thinks you are. He goes on C-SPAN when he was vice president and says,
[3:27:12.640 --> 3:27:19.640]  They don't know in Wyoming I'm with the CFR, which is Gold's end American sovereignty and erase the borders and all the rest of it.
[3:27:19.640 --> 3:27:24.640]  But he's got to brag to his white shoe boy, Jackoffs.
[3:27:24.640 --> 3:27:33.640]  Just like Biden did six years ago before they left office, he gets up on C-SPAN with the head of the CFR, Richard Haas.
[3:27:33.640 --> 3:27:39.640]  And he goes, Yeah, we told that prosecutor you'd investigate me and my son.
[3:27:39.640 --> 3:27:47.640]  Well, have you fired? If you want that billion dollars, fire him instead of a bitch. An hour later they fired him.
[3:27:47.640 --> 3:27:52.640]  It's the sick part is these weird Ivy League old white men.
[3:27:52.640 --> 3:27:57.640]  And that's who they are. I'm not against white people, but you don't know about white people. It's these people.
[3:27:57.640 --> 3:28:04.640]  You want to sit up there and lecture us and do all this while they fund all the black lives matter so we all kill each other.
[3:28:04.640 --> 3:28:13.640]  I am so sick of old white men, not the average old white man, they're great people, but this little clique that thinks they're better than everybody.
[3:28:13.640 --> 3:28:17.640]  You know who's screwing everybody over? Old white men.
[3:28:17.640 --> 3:28:23.640]  They try to run and say your seven year old son hadn't had his balls chopped off, so he's the reason the world ain't good.
[3:28:23.640 --> 3:28:29.640]  No Dick Cheney, it's because you ain't had your robotic heart torn out.
[3:28:29.640 --> 3:28:36.640]  Lovingly, figuratively, non-violently, politically. I wish no harm against Cheney. I want to turn him into a martyr.
[3:28:36.640 --> 3:28:42.640]  I want to turn him into the demon he is and I want to politically and culturally assassinate his credibility.
[3:28:42.640 --> 3:28:48.640]  Not physically, but I want to destroy that old evil white man.
[3:28:48.640 --> 3:28:53.640]  Stay with us. We'll be right back. Infowars.com

[3:29:49.640 --> 3:29:55.640]  Thank you so much for joining us. I'll spread the word, my friends. We're involved in an epic historic battle.
[3:29:55.640 --> 3:30:03.640]  We are now living in the void, sliding towards collapse in the strange space between what we've known and what's to come.
[3:30:03.640 --> 3:30:16.640]  And right now, the most important thing to remember is, don't panic. Stay calm, because now is the time that we must get our bearings and steer the ship onto a safe sound course.
[3:30:16.640 --> 3:30:23.640]  There is nothing stopping we, the people, from making our own rules and building our own society.
[3:30:23.640 --> 3:30:28.640]  All we gotta do is survive the crash. And right now, we still have time to prepare.
[3:30:28.640 --> 3:30:35.640]  The world fiat currency system is racing towards zero. It's time to convert it into hard assets.
[3:30:35.640 --> 3:30:45.640]  Now, including food, water, and survival gear, to keep us strong and at the ready, go to preparedtoday.com for the essentials.
[3:30:45.640 --> 3:30:54.640]  Storeable foods, water filtration, first aid, power, and more at preparedtoday.com
[3:30:54.640 --> 3:31:01.640]  If you're like myself and so many other people on this planet, especially as you get older, you gain weight, even if you eat a lot less.
[3:31:01.640 --> 3:31:06.640]  I gotta tell you, Info Wars is only about bringing you amazing products that really work.
[3:31:06.640 --> 3:31:11.640]  So we looked at the supplement market that we fund a lot of our operations with, and we said,
[3:31:11.640 --> 3:31:17.640]  what are the best-selling, natural, healthy, anti-fat weight loss products that are out there?
[3:31:17.640 --> 3:31:23.640]  We went and looked at the top ten, and they all had the same ingredients in common that is in this product.
[3:31:23.640 --> 3:31:35.640]  But with our new product from X7, Diet Force, we got the very best concentrates of these known natural essences that's just two amazing things for your body.
[3:31:35.640 --> 3:31:43.640]  And so I've lost almost 40 pounds, I'm just a little bit overweight, in the last three months, and I've been doing it using Diet Force and also Exercise.
[3:31:43.640 --> 3:31:50.640]  Well, now Diet Force is exclusively available right now at InfoWarsStore.com, 40% off.
[3:31:50.640 --> 3:31:55.640]  InfoWarsStore.com, Diet Force, you need to take this product, it really works.
[3:31:55.640 --> 3:32:01.640]  People say Alex Jones is crazy, he's a conspiracy theory guy, he's a nutcase, he's got these rants and all that.
[3:32:01.640 --> 3:32:09.640]  What they miss is that this guy's ahead of the curve on so many different topics of signal, not noise.
[3:32:09.640 --> 3:32:15.640]  If you look at the signal, and you compare that to PBS and NPR and BBC,
[3:32:15.640 --> 3:32:21.640]  and we'll do what Alex Jones put out there versus what your collective body has put out there,
[3:32:21.640 --> 3:32:25.640]  and if you're a sentient human being and just watching it, you say, well, Alex Jones is ahead of this,
[3:32:25.640 --> 3:32:27.640]  not only that, he kind of explained it.
[3:32:27.640 --> 3:32:30.640]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[3:32:30.640 --> 3:32:35.640]  That is very rare, you've got to go back almost to the revolutionary generation and see that.
[3:32:35.640 --> 3:32:42.640]  In this new book, I've got to tell you, when Tony Lyons first approached me, I read this thing, I go, this is it, this is no beetroot.
[3:32:42.640 --> 3:32:46.640]  You're not going to be flipping pages, you're going to be having a pin out and you're going to be underlining stuff.
[3:32:46.640 --> 3:33:13.640]  Great Reset by Alex Jones. Order your copy now at Amazon or infowarstore.com.
[3:33:23.640 --> 3:33:25.640]  Welcome back.
[3:33:25.640 --> 3:33:34.640]  Robert Barnes rides the shotgun with me, if he'll do it, I'll co-host the War Room with him and Owen coming up here in about 45 minutes or now 30 minutes.
[3:33:34.640 --> 3:33:40.640]  Barnes, you're a great constitutional lawyer, work for President Trump, a lot of great work, you're suing Pfizer's success with the big whistleblower,
[3:33:40.640 --> 3:33:44.640]  you have the number one cases for all the documents, it's literally exposing them right now.
[3:33:44.640 --> 3:33:50.640]  But watching this trial, I don't talk about myself all day, but watching this, have you ever seen anything like it?
[3:33:50.640 --> 3:33:57.640]  I mean, it's a complete railroading in the sense that they designed this case and scripted it for just a different ending than the ending they got.
[3:33:57.640 --> 3:34:00.640]  They did everything possible to orchestrate a particular ending.
[3:34:00.640 --> 3:34:09.640]  The ending was supposed to be the death of Alex Jones, the end of Alex Jones, a verdict that's 100 million, 150 million, and then another 100 million.
[3:34:09.640 --> 3:34:12.640]  This morning when they came in, they looked like they were pop balloons.
[3:34:12.640 --> 3:34:17.640]  Oh, no doubt, I mean, Bankston the other day was trying to spin, well, we'll get a massive punitive damages.
[3:34:17.640 --> 3:34:19.640]  Look at AP, 270 million.
[3:34:19.640 --> 3:34:20.640]  Yeah, exactly.
[3:34:20.640 --> 3:34:22.640]  I don't have 5 million in assets.
[3:34:22.640 --> 3:34:27.640]  I was ready to sworn statement, show all my bank accounts and my house and everything.
[3:34:27.640 --> 3:34:35.640]  Well, and the assessment makes no sense because he's saying that Infowars is worth something that if you retired tomorrow is actually in the hole.
[3:34:35.640 --> 3:34:37.640]  That's why Infowars is in free time.
[3:34:37.640 --> 3:34:43.640]  It's like Michael Jordan, the bulls are great while he's there if he leaves, I'm not trying to compare myself to that, but that's the analogy.
[3:34:43.640 --> 3:34:44.640]  Absolutely it is.
[3:34:44.640 --> 3:34:54.640]  I mean, I've never seen a media valuation of a company that is based on continued, you know, if you work for the next 50 years, maybe that much money could possibly come in over 50 years.
[3:34:54.640 --> 3:34:57.640]  Let's say Schwarzenegger signed to a certain studio for five more films.
[3:34:57.640 --> 3:35:00.640]  He ends that contract that values not there back when he was the top guy.
[3:35:00.640 --> 3:35:01.640]  Exactly.
[3:35:01.640 --> 3:35:04.640]  So this economic valuation does not have any economic merit whatsoever.
[3:35:04.640 --> 3:35:07.640]  It's something that nobody credibly would put out there at all.
[3:35:07.640 --> 3:35:08.640]  But he did worse than that.
[3:35:08.640 --> 3:35:13.640]  He got up before I left this morning and said, Jones made $61 million last year.
[3:35:13.640 --> 3:35:15.640]  We didn't gross that.
[3:35:15.640 --> 3:35:16.640]  It was just a made up number.
[3:35:16.640 --> 3:35:17.640]  Exactly.
[3:35:17.640 --> 3:35:18.640]  I mean, where do they get that?
[3:35:18.640 --> 3:35:23.640]  Well, the other thing is it's kind of extraordinary for all the claims that you didn't turn over discovery.
[3:35:23.640 --> 3:35:28.640]  How is it they have all of these detailed information that they can cope with these crazy projections?
[3:35:28.640 --> 3:35:31.640]  The reality is, of course, everything was turned over.
[3:35:31.640 --> 3:35:35.640]  But what is turned over, they're misestimating and miscalculating and misallocating.
[3:35:35.640 --> 3:35:37.640]  Well, I'll tell you what 61 million was.
[3:35:37.640 --> 3:35:39.640]  It was four years of supplement purchases.
[3:35:39.640 --> 3:35:40.640]  Right.
[3:35:40.640 --> 3:35:41.640]  Which we gave them.
[3:35:41.640 --> 3:35:42.640]  Right.
[3:35:42.640 --> 3:35:43.640]  Exactly.
[3:35:43.640 --> 3:35:44.640]  They go, what is this PQPR money paid?
[3:35:44.640 --> 3:35:45.640]  It's the damn product.
[3:35:45.640 --> 3:35:46.640]  Right.
[3:35:46.640 --> 3:35:47.640]  Oh, exactly.
[3:35:47.640 --> 3:35:48.640]  Down to the receipts.
[3:35:48.640 --> 3:35:53.640]  And anybody who knows how the model works, they don't have an expert that's in this particular market space,
[3:35:53.640 --> 3:35:56.640]  either the media space or in the supplement space.
[3:35:56.640 --> 3:35:58.640]  Well, he's like that economist in back at school.
[3:35:58.640 --> 3:35:59.640]  Yes.
[3:35:59.640 --> 3:36:00.640]  Yes, exactly.
[3:36:00.640 --> 3:36:01.640]  We're going to make those widgets.
[3:36:01.640 --> 3:36:02.640]  Where are we going to make those widgets?
[3:36:02.640 --> 3:36:05.640]  And Rodney Dangerfield explains how the real economy works.
[3:36:05.640 --> 3:36:09.640]  And then when he shot down Rodney, the Rodney Dangerfield says, well, if you're going to build this factory,
[3:36:09.640 --> 3:36:12.640]  you should build it in Disneyland because that's where fantasies come true.
[3:36:12.640 --> 3:36:15.640]  And that's the nature of the entire testimony that's been presented.
[3:36:15.640 --> 3:36:19.640]  It's also why they had to not allow you to present any evidence,
[3:36:19.640 --> 3:36:24.640]  because an honest evaluation would say that there isn't this crazy estimation,
[3:36:24.640 --> 3:36:26.640]  this crazy value out there that they're putting out there.
[3:36:26.640 --> 3:36:27.640]  They knew that.
[3:36:27.640 --> 3:36:29.640]  Otherwise, they wouldn't demand no defense.
[3:36:29.640 --> 3:36:30.640]  But here's the little secret.
[3:36:30.640 --> 3:36:34.640]  They don't want me to say it until everything's closed out.
[3:36:34.640 --> 3:36:38.640]  But under Texas law, their $4 million judgment is half.
[3:36:38.640 --> 3:36:44.640]  And if they do a huge billion dollar punitive, it's capped at one point something million.
[3:36:44.640 --> 3:36:45.640]  Yeah, it's $750,000.
[3:36:45.640 --> 3:36:46.640]  Bankston was out there the other day.
[3:36:46.640 --> 3:36:50.640]  The plaintiff's lawyer was out there spinning to the media how there could be,
[3:36:50.640 --> 3:36:54.640]  there was going to be a $50 million, $100 million kind of judgment coming in punitive damages.
[3:36:54.640 --> 3:36:56.640]  Completely got wrong.
[3:36:56.640 --> 3:36:59.640]  The media was recycling this as if it was the truth about Texas law.
[3:36:59.640 --> 3:37:03.640]  The AP says I'm worth $270 million.
[3:37:03.640 --> 3:37:05.640]  This company has major liabilities.
[3:37:05.640 --> 3:37:06.640]  I'm in the hole.
[3:37:06.640 --> 3:37:07.640]  Exactly.
[3:37:07.640 --> 3:37:08.640]  That's why the company.
[3:37:08.640 --> 3:37:10.640]  I'm telling my wife, I got to bow the yard.
[3:37:10.640 --> 3:37:12.640]  I'm telling her, we got to fire the lawn staff.
[3:37:12.640 --> 3:37:14.640]  We can't pay $100 a week.
[3:37:14.640 --> 3:37:15.640]  Well, exactly.
[3:37:15.640 --> 3:37:18.640]  Well, that's why Free Speed Systems is in bankruptcy.
[3:37:18.640 --> 3:37:21.640]  All of that's fully disclosed under penalty of perjury, et cetera.
[3:37:21.640 --> 3:37:25.640]  And so the reason that they had to spin it this way is because they didn't get the big verdict.
[3:37:25.640 --> 3:37:27.640]  My wife's like, can we repaint the bedroom?
[3:37:27.640 --> 3:37:28.640]  I said, no.
[3:37:28.640 --> 3:37:29.640]  Yeah, exactly.
[3:37:29.640 --> 3:37:30.640]  I'm so rich.
[3:37:30.640 --> 3:37:31.640]  Yeah, precisely.
[3:37:31.640 --> 3:37:32.640]  Just rolling in money.
[3:37:32.640 --> 3:37:35.640]  If you're rolling in that kind of money, you wouldn't be in this situation in the first place.
[3:37:35.640 --> 3:37:36.640]  That's the reality.
[3:37:36.640 --> 3:37:42.640]  So their goal was to get a huge verdict that they could use to be the death of Alex Jones.
[3:37:42.640 --> 3:37:45.640]  They didn't get that in the regular damages stage.
[3:37:45.640 --> 3:37:49.640]  They legally cannot get it in the punitive damages stage, no matter what the jury says.
[3:37:49.640 --> 3:37:50.640]  That's under Texas law.
[3:37:50.640 --> 3:37:52.640]  So what are they doing?
[3:37:52.640 --> 3:37:57.640]  I mean, I was watching some of this during breaks today or bringing me to clubs.
[3:37:57.640 --> 3:38:00.640]  I made 61 million last year.
[3:38:00.640 --> 3:38:02.640]  The little secret is I didn't take a paycheck.
[3:38:02.640 --> 3:38:05.640]  Even the bankruptcy court is highly impressed.
[3:38:05.640 --> 3:38:08.640]  And I haven't taken a paycheck in a year and a half.
[3:38:08.640 --> 3:38:11.640]  Instead, I injected my house sale into this.
[3:38:11.640 --> 3:38:12.640]  I saw some of the media coverage.
[3:38:12.640 --> 3:38:15.640]  And notably, the media coverage did not dispute what you just said.
[3:38:15.640 --> 3:38:17.640]  So that proves that that is in fact the case.
[3:38:17.640 --> 3:38:19.640]  They don't have any evidence to the...
[3:38:19.640 --> 3:38:20.640]  What were they saying?
[3:38:20.640 --> 3:38:25.640]  The evidence, what they talk about is what was made in the past, gross revenues, estimations,
[3:38:25.640 --> 3:38:31.640]  nothing about actual net profit, actual made income in a particular year in this year.
[3:38:31.640 --> 3:38:34.640]  And it's not even clear how much of this is relevant, but...
[3:38:34.640 --> 3:38:35.640]  Well, here's my problem.
[3:38:35.640 --> 3:38:39.640]  I could get major national food guys that are on Hannity and on Beck.
[3:38:39.640 --> 3:38:40.640]  And I'm not attacking them.
[3:38:40.640 --> 3:38:41.640]  Maybe they're smarter than me.
[3:38:41.640 --> 3:38:43.640]  Their food makes 60%, 70%.
[3:38:43.640 --> 3:38:44.640]  Ours makes 30%.
[3:38:44.640 --> 3:38:46.640]  Because it is the best lowest price.
[3:38:46.640 --> 3:38:49.640]  I have this weird, neurotic thing to give our listeners the best deal.
[3:38:49.640 --> 3:38:52.640]  So I would probably actually be rich like them if I did that.
[3:38:52.640 --> 3:38:53.640]  Right.
[3:38:53.640 --> 3:38:56.640]  Well, if they simply did a market analysis of the business, they would have come up with
[3:38:56.640 --> 3:38:58.640]  a very different evaluation.
[3:38:58.640 --> 3:39:00.640]  And they came up with the valuation that...
[3:39:00.640 --> 3:39:01.640]  Well, exactly.
[3:39:01.640 --> 3:39:03.640]  Brad and Dunn Street has a real accurate report.
[3:39:03.640 --> 3:39:04.640]  Because I saw it sent to me a month ago.
[3:39:04.640 --> 3:39:05.640]  My lawyer says this address.
[3:39:05.640 --> 3:39:07.640]  I said, yeah, how do they know?
[3:39:07.640 --> 3:39:09.640]  I have a $5 million asset total.
[3:39:09.640 --> 3:39:10.640]  You don't count my debt.
[3:39:10.640 --> 3:39:11.640]  Count debt.
[3:39:11.640 --> 3:39:12.640]  I'm $30 million in the hole.
[3:39:12.640 --> 3:39:13.640]  I'm like, how do they know?
[3:39:13.640 --> 3:39:14.640]  They go, they got AI, man.
[3:39:14.640 --> 3:39:16.640]  That's how Bloomberg got so rich, too.
[3:39:16.640 --> 3:39:17.640]  I don't know how they know.
[3:39:17.640 --> 3:39:19.640]  I don't know how Brad Dunn Street knows what I've got.
[3:39:19.640 --> 3:39:20.640]  They know.
[3:39:20.640 --> 3:39:23.640]  They make estimates based on available public information so they can sort of put it together.
[3:39:23.640 --> 3:39:24.640]  And sometimes...
[3:39:24.640 --> 3:39:25.640]  Well, that's smart, though.
[3:39:25.640 --> 3:39:26.640]  Those people, I mean...
[3:39:26.640 --> 3:39:27.640]  Oh, yeah.
[3:39:27.640 --> 3:39:28.640]  Sometimes their estimates are really good.
[3:39:28.640 --> 3:39:29.640]  Sometimes their estimates are off.
[3:39:29.640 --> 3:39:30.640]  It all depends on the circumstances.
[3:39:30.640 --> 3:39:31.640]  Well, they're dead on with me.
[3:39:31.640 --> 3:39:32.640]  Yeah, and their source data.
[3:39:32.640 --> 3:39:33.640]  But yeah, so this...
[3:39:33.640 --> 3:39:34.640]  All of this is a show.
[3:39:34.640 --> 3:39:36.640]  I mean, I mean, this was a show trial from the beginning.
[3:39:36.640 --> 3:39:38.640]  But this punitive damages stage is purely a show.
[3:39:38.640 --> 3:39:39.640]  But it's amazing.
[3:39:39.640 --> 3:39:43.640]  If I was the plaintiffs, I would not want there to be more appellate reversible error.
[3:39:43.640 --> 3:39:47.640]  Yet that's what they did by not allowing you to present a defense on the punitive damages stage.
[3:39:47.640 --> 3:39:48.640]  Exactly.
[3:39:48.640 --> 3:39:51.640]  They would not let us bring witnesses...
[3:39:51.640 --> 3:39:52.640]  I was already...
[3:39:52.640 --> 3:39:53.640]  But lawyers, they checked everything.
[3:39:53.640 --> 3:39:54.640]  We had it down to the number.
[3:39:54.640 --> 3:39:56.640]  I was going to read, I have this bank account.
[3:39:56.640 --> 3:39:57.640]  I have this.
[3:39:57.640 --> 3:39:58.640]  A few things.
[3:39:58.640 --> 3:39:59.640]  Yeah.
[3:39:59.640 --> 3:40:00.640]  They didn't want that.
[3:40:00.640 --> 3:40:01.640]  No, of course not.
[3:40:01.640 --> 3:40:02.640]  Because they know that the truth is against their story.
[3:40:02.640 --> 3:40:04.640]  That's why they had to try to script this whole case.
[3:40:04.640 --> 3:40:08.640]  They didn't get the ending they wanted because there's a lack of credibility.
[3:40:08.640 --> 3:40:12.640]  And in fact, the only thing that's going to be memorable out of this entire case is the
[3:40:12.640 --> 3:40:16.640]  meme that's going global around the world about your answering the question that they
[3:40:16.640 --> 3:40:18.640]  shouldn't have asked.
[3:40:18.640 --> 3:40:21.640]  Last time I checked without tracking it, 10 million views on Twitter.
[3:40:21.640 --> 3:40:22.640]  Yeah.
[3:40:22.640 --> 3:40:23.640]  And that's just one of them.
[3:40:23.640 --> 3:40:24.640]  I mean, there's like dozens.
[3:40:24.640 --> 3:40:25.640]  They're...
[3:40:25.640 --> 3:40:26.640]  Well, I had a few together.
[3:40:26.640 --> 3:40:28.640]  One's like 4 million, one's 2 million, one's...
[3:40:28.640 --> 3:40:29.640]  Oh, it's more and more and more.
[3:40:29.640 --> 3:40:30.640]  It's all over the place.
[3:40:30.640 --> 3:40:31.640]  It keeps...
[3:40:31.640 --> 3:40:33.640]  It is going to be the most memorable moment from this trial.
[3:40:33.640 --> 3:40:35.640]  And that's what wasn't supposed to happen.
[3:40:35.640 --> 3:40:36.640]  Well, this supposed to be...
[3:40:36.640 --> 3:40:37.640]  The headlines today...
[3:40:37.640 --> 3:40:38.640]  That's another thing.
[3:40:38.640 --> 3:40:39.640]  She keeps killing the YouTube feed.
[3:40:39.640 --> 3:40:40.640]  Yes.
[3:40:40.640 --> 3:40:41.640]  Yes.
[3:40:41.640 --> 3:40:42.640]  She doesn't want this information out there.
[3:40:42.640 --> 3:40:43.640]  No, no, no.
[3:40:43.640 --> 3:40:44.640]  Now she's doing it.
[3:40:44.640 --> 3:40:45.640]  Last few days, during it.
[3:40:45.640 --> 3:40:46.640]  Oh, really?
[3:40:46.640 --> 3:40:47.640]  When they speak, she kills it.
[3:40:47.640 --> 3:40:48.640]  Oh, wow.
[3:40:48.640 --> 3:40:49.640]  Yeah, that doesn't surprise me, sadly.
[3:40:49.640 --> 3:40:52.640]  This was supposed to be a particular scripted ending.
[3:40:52.640 --> 3:40:53.640]  They could rig the rules.
[3:40:53.640 --> 3:40:54.640]  They could rig the case.
[3:40:54.640 --> 3:40:56.640]  They could violate the rules of evidence.
[3:40:56.640 --> 3:40:58.640]  They could violate the constitutional protocols.
[3:40:58.640 --> 3:41:01.640]  And they still couldn't get the scripted ending that they wanted.
[3:41:01.640 --> 3:41:06.640]  And the reason they couldn't get the scripted ending that they wanted is because even a
[3:41:06.640 --> 3:41:11.640]  real Democratic Austin jury picked by the plaintiff's lawyers rejected the court...
[3:41:11.640 --> 3:41:16.640]  Being told 20-plus times in my presence, I'm sure it was more, back out of 20-plus,
[3:41:16.640 --> 3:41:17.640]  that I am guilty.
[3:41:17.640 --> 3:41:18.640]  Absolutely.
[3:41:18.640 --> 3:41:21.640]  And you're not allowed to present evidence on your side.
[3:41:21.640 --> 3:41:23.640]  Clips played completely out of context.
[3:41:23.640 --> 3:41:24.640]  Why do you think this morning I was there?
[3:41:24.640 --> 3:41:26.640]  The judge and the other plaintiff's lawyers were not laughing.
[3:41:26.640 --> 3:41:28.640]  They were not staring at me.
[3:41:28.640 --> 3:41:29.640]  They were not giggling.
[3:41:29.640 --> 3:41:31.640]  They looked defeated this morning.
[3:41:31.640 --> 3:41:35.640]  I think that some of those folks connected to the plaintiffs had put out the idea that
[3:41:35.640 --> 3:41:38.640]  this was going to be the death and end of Alex Jones.
[3:41:38.640 --> 3:41:40.640]  This verdict was going to come back in at 100 million.
[3:41:40.640 --> 3:41:43.640]  Then there was going to be another big punitive damages numbers.
[3:41:43.640 --> 3:41:48.640]  And that, consequently, the next day the sheriff would show up here at Info Wars,
[3:41:48.640 --> 3:41:51.640]  shut it all down, seize everything, and you name it.
[3:41:51.640 --> 3:41:53.640]  And that didn't happen.
[3:41:53.640 --> 3:41:54.640]  That hasn't happened.
[3:41:54.640 --> 3:41:59.640]  And that won't happen because even a liberal Democratic jury in Austin could see through
[3:41:59.640 --> 3:42:01.640]  the claims being made by the plaintiff's lawyers.
[3:42:01.640 --> 3:42:04.640]  It's not coming out that the jury was like, why doesn't he let him talk?
[3:42:04.640 --> 3:42:05.640]  Yeah.
[3:42:05.640 --> 3:42:07.640]  I mean, two jurors wouldn't even join in the verdict.
[3:42:07.640 --> 3:42:11.640]  And for the punitive damages, they need unanimous jurors to even get any punitive.
[3:42:11.640 --> 3:42:15.640]  So what's your prediction this afternoon, or maybe it'll be longer, on punitive?
[3:42:15.640 --> 3:42:16.640]  I don't think that there's...
[3:42:16.640 --> 3:42:18.640]  Because you said...
[3:42:18.640 --> 3:42:22.640]  I don't mean to kiss your ass, but you said before it happened yesterday, you said on air.
[3:42:22.640 --> 3:42:24.640]  You said, I think it's below 5 million.
[3:42:24.640 --> 3:42:28.640]  I think it's a very good chance that they can't even get punitive.
[3:42:28.640 --> 3:42:29.640]  Yeah.
[3:42:29.640 --> 3:42:30.640]  Well, that's a seven-figure verdict.
[3:42:30.640 --> 3:42:33.640]  And I don't think the punitive damages is going to come in anywhere near what they're talking about.
[3:42:33.640 --> 3:42:40.640]  Again, it's purely show-it-theatered symbolic at this point, because the cap is 1.5 between both claims.
[3:42:40.640 --> 3:42:43.640]  But why do they want it then, just for the show-troll?
[3:42:43.640 --> 3:42:45.640]  They just want a headline, a fake news headline.
[3:42:45.640 --> 3:42:46.640]  That's it.
[3:42:46.640 --> 3:42:51.640]  Just a fake news headline to make it look like Alex Jones is hated and despised.
[3:42:51.640 --> 3:42:55.640]  Wow, stay there.
[3:42:55.640 --> 3:43:00.640]  The great reset in the War for the World is the book that the government doesn't want you to read,
[3:43:00.640 --> 3:43:05.640]  that most of the big, powerful companies trying to control your life, the big tech companies,
[3:43:05.640 --> 3:43:07.640]  they don't want you to read this book.
[3:43:07.640 --> 3:43:12.640]  They want to control what you think, what you do, what you read, but you don't want that.
[3:43:12.640 --> 3:43:14.640]  And Alex Jones doesn't want that.
[3:43:14.640 --> 3:43:20.640]  And this book shows you what's happening and gives you the sort of playbook for how to fight against it.
[3:43:20.640 --> 3:43:26.640]  And so by buying this book, you're going to prove that censorship doesn't work, that freedom is alive in this country.
[3:43:26.640 --> 3:43:33.640]  This is a central reading and, you know, I would go right now and buy it before the censorship kicks in.
[3:43:33.640 --> 3:43:35.640]  It's not going to be available in bookstores.
[3:43:35.640 --> 3:43:37.640]  It's not going to be available in libraries.
[3:43:37.640 --> 3:43:43.640]  They're going to try to take it down from every platform that they can, but they're not going to be able to do it.
[3:43:43.640 --> 3:43:45.640]  Prove that censorship doesn't work.
[3:43:45.640 --> 3:43:46.640]  Buy the great reset.
[3:43:46.640 --> 3:43:47.640]  Thank you, Alex Jones.
[3:43:47.640 --> 3:43:54.640]  I really appreciate you having me on and I appreciate you writing this book and getting the information out there.
[3:43:54.640 --> 3:44:00.640]  We brought the game changing product previously only available to major oil companies around the world.
[3:44:00.640 --> 3:44:02.640]  The civilian market two years ago.
[3:44:02.640 --> 3:44:08.640]  The bio pros for septic tanks for porta potties for RVs for your drains, your boats.
[3:44:08.640 --> 3:44:09.640]  It goes on and on.
[3:44:09.640 --> 3:44:11.640]  It'll eat the oil off of your driveway.
[3:44:11.640 --> 3:44:14.640]  If you just add water, but it's been so successful.
[3:44:14.640 --> 3:44:18.640]  Now we're selling it to major RV parks, pig farms.
[3:44:18.640 --> 3:44:23.640]  You name it, because this stuff will eat anything that is organic.
[3:44:23.640 --> 3:44:27.640]  And it's exclusively available at the bio pros.com.
[3:44:27.640 --> 3:44:30.640]  And now info wars.com.
[3:44:30.640 --> 3:44:32.640]  We sold out of this for almost a year.
[3:44:32.640 --> 3:44:39.640]  We made a major purchase and it is now in stock for whatever your need is at info wars.com.
[3:44:39.640 --> 3:44:49.640]  You'll also find instructional videos and more information at info wars.com or the bio pros.com made America powered by God's great creation.
[3:44:49.640 --> 3:44:54.640]  It is amazing and it funds the info war.
[3:44:54.640 --> 3:44:56.640]  People say Alex Jones crazy.
[3:44:56.640 --> 3:44:57.640]  He's a conspiracy theory guy.
[3:44:57.640 --> 3:44:58.640]  He's a nutcase.
[3:44:58.640 --> 3:45:00.640]  He got these rants and all that.
[3:45:00.640 --> 3:45:08.640]  What they miss is that this guy's ahead of the curve on so many different topics of signal, not noise.
[3:45:08.640 --> 3:45:16.640]  If you look at the signal and you compare that to PBS and NPR and BBC and we'll do what Alex Jones put out there.
[3:45:16.640 --> 3:45:20.640]  Versus what your collective body has put out there.
[3:45:20.640 --> 3:45:24.640]  And if you're a sent in a human being and just watching it and you say, well God, Alex Jones is ahead of this.
[3:45:24.640 --> 3:45:26.640]  Not only that, he kind of explained it.
[3:45:26.640 --> 3:45:29.640]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[3:45:29.640 --> 3:45:30.640]  That is very rare.
[3:45:30.640 --> 3:45:34.640]  You've got to go back almost to the revolutionary generation and see that.
[3:45:34.640 --> 3:45:38.640]  In this new book, I've got to tell you, when Tony Lyons first approached me, I read this thing.
[3:45:38.640 --> 3:45:39.640]  I go, this is it.
[3:45:39.640 --> 3:45:41.640]  This is no beetry.
[3:45:41.640 --> 3:45:42.640]  You're not going to be flipping pages.
[3:45:42.640 --> 3:45:45.640]  You're going to be having a pen out and you're going to be underlying stuff.
[3:45:45.640 --> 3:45:48.640]  The Great Reset by Alex Jones.

[3:45:54.640 --> 3:46:02.640]  The globalists are fighting around the clock to destroy the family, to destroy heterosexual relationships, to annihilate our marriages.
[3:46:02.640 --> 3:46:04.640]  And the studies are all clear.
[3:46:04.640 --> 3:46:10.640]  The number one cause of marital splits is that there is problems in the bedroom.
[3:46:10.640 --> 3:46:14.640]  And the number one issue men have is erectile dysfunction.
[3:46:14.640 --> 3:46:20.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, the left makes big jokes about this because they don't want people having lasting, good, loving relationships.
[3:46:20.640 --> 3:46:22.640]  They want to break up society.
[3:46:22.640 --> 3:46:31.640]  And we are so excited to have the number one natural male enhancement pill in the world, available as a major sponsor now.

[3:46:44.640 --> 3:46:46.640]  And it's not just for folks that have problems in the bedroom.
[3:46:46.640 --> 3:46:48.640]  This also enhances it.
[3:46:48.640 --> 3:47:13.640]  So again, get yours today at theironpatriot.com.
[3:47:13.640 --> 3:47:23.640]  One of the things you've been talking about on your show is your allegation that government officials are aiding in pedophilia,
[3:47:23.640 --> 3:47:44.640]  child trafficking, and the grooming of children.
[3:47:44.640 --> 3:48:03.640]  What do you mean by what Jeffrey Epstein did with Clems?
[3:48:03.640 --> 3:48:04.640]  All right, Barnes.
[3:48:04.640 --> 3:48:07.640]  So that's the big takeaway from this trial and thanks to our great listeners.
[3:48:07.640 --> 3:48:12.640]  We're still on air fighting back against this tyranny.
[3:48:12.640 --> 3:48:14.640]  So much unfolding.
[3:48:14.640 --> 3:48:18.640]  Again, I think it's criminal to have a judge say this is televised,
[3:48:18.640 --> 3:48:22.640]  and then she cuts the YouTube off when we speak or lawyers speak she doesn't like.
[3:48:22.640 --> 3:48:25.640]  It only puts it on when they're having their people speak.
[3:48:25.640 --> 3:48:26.640]  I mean, I think that's wrong.
[3:48:26.640 --> 3:48:27.640]  I mean, all of it was scripted.
[3:48:27.640 --> 3:48:29.640]  I mean, it was literally three movie cameras in there.
[3:48:29.640 --> 3:48:32.640]  The only thing that went AWOL for them is they didn't get the ending that they wanted
[3:48:32.640 --> 3:48:35.640]  and they didn't get the ending they wanted because even a liberal Democratic jury in Austin
[3:48:35.640 --> 3:48:41.640]  that was selected by these plaintiffs lawyers rejected the core aspects of their theory and thesis.
[3:48:41.640 --> 3:48:46.640]  They got to see you live and you were not the caricature that they tried to make you out to be.
[3:48:46.640 --> 3:48:49.640]  And even though they played altered clips and altered edited videos,
[3:48:49.640 --> 3:48:51.640]  sometimes only five, seven seconds long.
[3:48:51.640 --> 3:48:54.640]  In fact, appeared some, I think one was like two seconds long.
[3:48:54.640 --> 3:48:55.640]  The one about you was five seconds.
[3:48:55.640 --> 3:48:56.640]  Yeah, five seconds.
[3:48:56.640 --> 3:49:00.640]  Personally, if I was a plaintiff's lawyer, I would not have put me in the trial.
[3:49:00.640 --> 3:49:02.640]  I would not have put a lot of things into the trial.
[3:49:02.640 --> 3:49:05.640]  I would not have put the allegations and concerns about the judge into the trial.
[3:49:05.640 --> 3:49:09.640]  I would not have put the allegations and concerns about how the whole court proceeding was going on.
[3:49:09.640 --> 3:49:14.640]  It was clear by some of the juror questions that there were jurors who were bothered by how the trial was being conducted,
[3:49:14.640 --> 3:49:19.640]  by how the way the trial was being done because ordinary Americans, even liberal Democrats,
[3:49:19.640 --> 3:49:22.640]  still understand some of the core principles that make America American.
[3:49:22.640 --> 3:49:25.640]  Part of that's supposed to be respect for the rule of law.
[3:49:25.640 --> 3:49:28.640]  Part of that's supposed to be everybody gets their day in court.
[3:49:28.640 --> 3:49:33.640]  Part of that's supposed to be trial by jury on all facts relevant to the case.
[3:49:33.640 --> 3:49:38.640]  They tried and in fact did deny all of that and because of it, they didn't get the verdict.
[3:49:38.640 --> 3:49:43.640]  So as you said a month ago, the Democrat party weaponized you just shared it was on trial here.
[3:49:43.640 --> 3:49:46.640]  No question. The legal system was on trial and the verdict is in.
[3:49:46.640 --> 3:49:49.640]  And the verdict is in by implication from the jury itself,
[3:49:49.640 --> 3:49:55.640]  which is that the Travis County justice system failed the rules of American freedom, American law, and American democracy.
[3:49:55.640 --> 3:49:58.640]  It denied basic core rights and everybody could see it.
[3:49:58.640 --> 3:50:02.640]  You're seeing people across the political spectrum, across the legal spectrum,
[3:50:02.640 --> 3:50:07.640]  comment on this case and describe it as being outrageous how the case was preceded.
[3:50:07.640 --> 3:50:09.640]  And how it was dealt with in general.
[3:50:09.640 --> 3:50:15.640]  Indeed, the fact that you had a case that was supposed to be all about Sandy Hook,
[3:50:15.640 --> 3:50:20.640]  became all about Travis County justice system being completely off the rails.
[3:50:20.640 --> 3:50:24.640]  And for folks that don't know the history, Travis County is as bad as DC.
[3:50:24.640 --> 3:50:27.640]  No doubt. I mean Travis County targeted Tom DeLay, targeted Rick Perry,
[3:50:27.640 --> 3:50:30.640]  has targeted political opponents and adversaries in the past,
[3:50:30.640 --> 3:50:35.640]  but even they got more of a trial than Alex Jones and Info Wars got in Travis County.
[3:50:35.640 --> 3:50:38.640]  Complete denial of all evidence that was favorable.
[3:50:38.640 --> 3:50:41.640]  And talking about balls, Rick Perry vetoed a bill in the Constitution.
[3:50:41.640 --> 3:50:42.640]  Oh, exactly.
[3:50:42.640 --> 3:50:45.640]  They had died of him vetoing a bill.
[3:50:45.640 --> 3:50:49.640]  And neither one of us were big fans of Tom DeLay, but the allegations were trumped up bogus allegations.
[3:50:49.640 --> 3:50:51.640]  He was not laundering money.
[3:50:51.640 --> 3:50:54.640]  No, that was always fictional and fabricated.
[3:50:54.640 --> 3:50:56.640]  Found guilty though, but overturned an appeal.
[3:50:56.640 --> 3:51:01.640]  Exactly. And I think that's what they needed a verdict that was so big that it couldn't be bondable in Texas.
[3:51:01.640 --> 3:51:05.640]  They didn't get that. Why? Because they don't want the Texas Supreme Court to look at this case.
[3:51:05.640 --> 3:51:09.640]  Because if the Texas Supreme Court does look at this case, it has to be thrown out on pretty much.
[3:51:09.640 --> 3:51:11.640]  They've got two more bites of the apple.
[3:51:11.640 --> 3:51:13.640]  Connecticut coming up and another Texas case.
[3:51:13.640 --> 3:51:16.640]  I think they can't help themselves. They try to do it again.
[3:51:16.640 --> 3:51:19.640]  I have no doubt that they will try to replay and repeat this script,
[3:51:19.640 --> 3:51:21.640]  but they didn't get the ending they needed the first time.
[3:51:21.640 --> 3:51:23.640]  There's no reason to believe they'll get it the second time.
[3:51:23.640 --> 3:51:24.640]  I mean, how much more can be done?
[3:51:24.640 --> 3:51:28.640]  By the way, you did focus groups, so did we.
[3:51:28.640 --> 3:51:30.640]  You predicted this.
[3:51:30.640 --> 3:51:35.640]  I mean, the ordinary jury, if you had had Mike Cernovich said it himself yesterday,
[3:51:35.640 --> 3:51:39.640]  this case and this verdict shows that if Alex Jones got an actual fair jury,
[3:51:39.640 --> 3:51:43.640]  they would have come back with no damages being caused by Alex Jones.
[3:51:43.640 --> 3:51:45.640]  They were told by a judge there are damages.
[3:51:45.640 --> 3:51:50.640]  Yeah, exactly. They were required to find damages because guilt was presumed.
[3:51:50.640 --> 3:51:56.640]  I think as one news reporter put it, it's Alex Jones case is guilty until proven bankrupt.
[3:51:56.640 --> 3:52:00.640]  That's been it. But that's the problem is that it was so over the top
[3:52:00.640 --> 3:52:03.640]  that even a sympathetic favorable jury pool,
[3:52:03.640 --> 3:52:07.640]  handpicked by the plaintiff's lawyers in substantial part,
[3:52:07.640 --> 3:52:11.640]  still couldn't get them the scripted ending that they needed and that they wanted.
[3:52:11.640 --> 3:52:14.640]  I'll tell you, I don't care about these evil lawyers.
[3:52:14.640 --> 3:52:15.640]  I've been trying to beat them.
[3:52:15.640 --> 3:52:18.640]  That's like stomping on dog crap in your yard.
[3:52:18.640 --> 3:52:20.640]  I wish they would just wake up and be good people,
[3:52:20.640 --> 3:52:22.640]  but they look completely deflated this morning.
[3:52:22.640 --> 3:52:26.640]  Yeah, and you can see it in the same in the press statements last night.
[3:52:26.640 --> 3:52:29.640]  That's why they were saying, well, don't worry.
[3:52:29.640 --> 3:52:32.640]  I think they were predicting that a lot of people connected to this case.
[3:52:32.640 --> 3:52:34.640]  This will be the death of Alex Jones.
[3:52:34.640 --> 3:52:36.640]  It's going to be a hundred million dollar verdict.
[3:52:36.640 --> 3:52:37.640]  He won't be able to bond it.
[3:52:37.640 --> 3:52:40.640]  We're going to be seizing infowars tomorrow.
[3:52:40.640 --> 3:52:41.640]  That was the pitch in narrative.
[3:52:41.640 --> 3:52:46.640]  And instead, the jury came out with a curveball that threw out their entire script ending.
[3:52:46.640 --> 3:52:48.640]  And consequently, they're trying to figure out a sequel,
[3:52:48.640 --> 3:52:50.640]  and there isn't a sequel to be scripted here.
[3:52:50.640 --> 3:52:53.640]  Other than the same abuse of the judicial process we just witnessed.
[3:52:53.640 --> 3:52:54.640]  Just like January 6th.
[3:52:54.640 --> 3:52:57.640]  Let's play a couple of these insane clips.
[3:52:57.640 --> 3:52:59.640]  This is one of their lawyers.
[3:52:59.640 --> 3:53:02.640]  He says, we started this trial asking you for $150 million,
[3:53:02.640 --> 3:53:04.640]  and we stand by that request.
[3:53:04.640 --> 3:53:06.640]  Let's play that clip.
[3:53:06.640 --> 3:53:14.640]  We started this trial asking you for $150 million.
[3:53:14.640 --> 3:53:18.640]  And we stand by that request.
[3:53:18.640 --> 3:53:29.640]  We ask that you give another $145,900,000.
[3:53:29.640 --> 3:53:32.640]  That plus your verdict is $150 million.
[3:53:32.640 --> 3:53:35.640]  So they want to just put on billboards, $150 million verdict.
[3:53:35.640 --> 3:53:36.640]  That's exactly right.
[3:53:36.640 --> 3:53:41.640]  Because they know legally they're not entitled to more than $1.5 million under Texas law.
[3:53:41.640 --> 3:53:44.640]  So it doesn't matter what, if the jury comes back with more than that,
[3:53:44.640 --> 3:53:47.640]  then it doesn't matter how much more than that it's capped.
[3:53:47.640 --> 3:53:49.640]  So this is pure theater now.
[3:53:49.640 --> 3:53:52.640]  This is purely staged scripted.
[3:53:52.640 --> 3:53:56.640]  What they wanted to criticize us for saying, which was that this was a scripted case.
[3:53:56.640 --> 3:53:59.640]  She's turning on and off the feed when we speak.
[3:53:59.640 --> 3:54:00.640]  She turns it off.
[3:54:00.640 --> 3:54:02.640]  She admits it.
[3:54:02.640 --> 3:54:05.640]  She turns the YouTube off when we speak.
[3:54:05.640 --> 3:54:08.640]  And she deletes it when it finishes the end of the day.
[3:54:08.640 --> 3:54:11.640]  She says nobody can share it unless she approves it and authorizes it.
[3:54:11.640 --> 3:54:12.640]  It's desperate.
[3:54:12.640 --> 3:54:13.640]  Completely.
[3:54:13.640 --> 3:54:16.640]  If she wants to be a director, she should spend a few years actually making movies.
[3:54:16.640 --> 3:54:20.640]  Here is the same lawyer that the worst part is, I said, lock her up.
[3:54:20.640 --> 3:54:23.640]  So at the end of the day, it's like, we're here because he criticized Hillary.
[3:54:23.640 --> 3:54:24.640]  Here it is.
[3:54:24.640 --> 3:54:28.640]  Alex Jones representative saying, I know he was reckless.
[3:54:28.640 --> 3:54:30.640]  Alex knows he was reckless.
[3:54:30.640 --> 3:54:39.640]  And then immediately going, but Megan Kelly said it.
[3:54:39.640 --> 3:54:49.640]  But the truth is said, but there were other websites, but Hillary Clinton.
[3:54:49.640 --> 3:54:58.640]  Hell, at one point, I thought he was going to start yelling or chanting, lock her up.
[3:54:58.640 --> 3:55:00.640]  Well, we should have locked her up.
[3:55:00.640 --> 3:55:06.640]  They're like literally trying to sniff Hillary Clinton's butt when she's a politically dead item.
[3:55:06.640 --> 3:55:10.640]  Completely. I mean, and they don't realize that this is a small and bubbled universe.
[3:55:10.640 --> 3:55:14.640]  The press and the politicians and some of the lawyers involved.
[3:55:14.640 --> 3:55:15.640]  Why do they worship Hillary?
[3:55:15.640 --> 3:55:18.640]  I mean, I think it's part of their overarching mindset.
[3:55:18.640 --> 3:55:24.640]  I mean, you look also at the sort of subgenre of people that obsess over this case and obsess over hating Alex Jones.
[3:55:24.640 --> 3:55:28.640]  It is one big, it's like the rainbow coalition of freaks.
[3:55:28.640 --> 3:55:29.640]  It should be investigated.
[3:55:29.640 --> 3:55:30.640]  Yeah.
[3:55:30.640 --> 3:55:32.640]  There are people that, you know, it's just Rangers.
[3:55:32.640 --> 3:55:34.640]  It's like an automatic red flag.
[3:55:34.640 --> 3:55:38.640]  You're obsessed with this case and you hate Alex Jones and you got a weird Twitter handle.
[3:55:38.640 --> 3:55:40.640]  Chances are you're doing something.
[3:55:40.640 --> 3:55:44.640]  And we won't say what the law firms Twitter handles are, but it's not good.
[3:55:44.640 --> 3:55:49.640]  Yeah, I mean, some of the lawyers connected to this have some very unusual and interesting posts.
[3:55:49.640 --> 3:55:50.640]  Let's put it that way.
[3:55:50.640 --> 3:55:54.640]  But what happened was they needed a certain ending and they still need that ending for their theater, for their script,
[3:55:54.640 --> 3:55:56.640]  even though it has no legally binding effect.
[3:55:56.640 --> 3:55:59.640]  That shows what complete theater is.
[3:55:59.640 --> 3:56:00.640]  So we're here on Friday night.
[3:56:00.640 --> 3:56:03.640]  You think the jury comes in with a punitive tonight?
[3:56:03.640 --> 3:56:08.640]  It'll be interesting how hard that the two jurors that didn't even like giving any money,
[3:56:08.640 --> 3:56:09.640]  whether they hold out.
[3:56:09.640 --> 3:56:12.640]  And if they continue to hold out, it's either going to be a very low punitive damages verdict.
[3:56:12.640 --> 3:56:13.640]  That's right.
[3:56:13.640 --> 3:56:14.640]  You're going to have unanimous for that.
[3:56:14.640 --> 3:56:15.640]  Yeah.
[3:56:15.640 --> 3:56:16.640]  You got to have unanimous for punitive damages in Texas.
[3:56:16.640 --> 3:56:20.640]  And so I think to get that there, they're going to come back next week,
[3:56:20.640 --> 3:56:22.640]  or it's going to be a lot less than what the plaintiff said.
[3:56:22.640 --> 3:56:23.640]  Hi, Robert Barnes.
[3:56:23.640 --> 3:56:24.640]  Thanks for the last two weeks of coverage.
[3:56:24.640 --> 3:56:25.640]  Hope you stay longer.
[3:56:25.640 --> 3:56:27.640]  Hope you move to Austin while you're thinking about doing it.
[3:56:27.640 --> 3:56:29.640]  I hope people find your amazing show.
[3:56:29.640 --> 3:56:30.640]  Sure.

[3:56:36.640 --> 3:56:38.640]  just type in template in the search bar.

[3:56:45.640 --> 3:56:47.640]  I don't have $2 million.
[3:56:47.640 --> 3:56:49.640]  Our company's down to less than a million.
[3:56:49.640 --> 3:56:50.640]  I've got less than a million.
[3:56:50.640 --> 3:56:53.640]  And I'm ready to put it into the company, but it wouldn't run stuff for a month.
