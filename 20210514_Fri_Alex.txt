[00:00.000 --> 00:18.000]  In For Wars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:30.000 --> 00:58.000]  Well, the imposter in chief, the walking dead man, the zombie,
[00:58.000 --> 01:08.000]  the man that stumbles and falls upstairs, might as well have a poltergeist, walked out yesterday from
[01:08.000 --> 01:12.000]  the White House without his mask on to do the little ritual of taking it off up on the stage.
[01:12.000 --> 01:20.000]  And the world just marveled, we're free, and he said, I'm giving you your freedom back.
[01:20.000 --> 01:23.000]  You've earned your right to smile.
[01:23.000 --> 01:29.000]  Oh, I'm sorry. He didn't say right. He said the privilege to smile.
[01:29.000 --> 01:35.000]  Seeing someone's face, I guess in Saudi Arabia or in North Korea because they're not in the death camp,
[01:35.000 --> 01:41.000]  or one of the Apple Slave camps in China or here in America is now a privilege.
[01:41.000 --> 01:50.000]  We have that clip coming up for you today on this live May 14, 2021 transmission.
[01:50.000 --> 01:54.000]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:54.000 --> 01:58.000]  But here's really the big news.
[01:58.000 --> 02:06.000]  I got a lot of phone calls last night from cousins and family and my wife asked me,
[02:06.000 --> 02:11.000]  once my daughter had gone to bed at about nine at night, the youngest daughter,
[02:11.000 --> 02:14.000]  she said, okay, I mean, there's going to be a lot of traffic tomorrow.
[02:14.000 --> 02:17.000]  Everybody thinks the country's reopened.
[02:17.000 --> 02:21.000]  And she said, when do you think they're going to slam it back shut again?
[02:21.000 --> 02:25.000]  She listens to the show and I said, well, I'll cover it all tomorrow.
[02:25.000 --> 02:28.000]  But I laid it out for her.
[02:28.000 --> 02:32.000]  The enemy battle plan tells us how they're going to do it.
[02:32.000 --> 02:36.000]  And so guys, why don't you print me some of those articles about...
[02:36.000 --> 02:41.000]  Day Both Group says we need bi-yearly lockdowns to lower carbon.
[02:41.000 --> 02:45.000]  And then Greta Thunberg, who's a mouthpiece of the Rothschilds.
[02:45.000 --> 02:47.000]  She's like a little puppet.
[02:47.000 --> 02:48.000]  Oh, hi.
[02:48.000 --> 02:49.000]  I'm Greta Thunberg.
[02:49.000 --> 02:53.000]  They need to cut all the cars and eat the Rothschilds to live their life.
[02:53.000 --> 02:58.000]  Not a very good friend told us, but that's basically what's going on.
[02:58.000 --> 02:59.000]  Oh, hi.
[02:59.000 --> 03:02.000]  Let's get rid of all the humans.
[03:02.000 --> 03:07.000]  So we're going to be laying all that out today about, oh, we're learning that the government tells us
[03:07.000 --> 03:12.000]  when we can go outside and they tell us when we can show our face.
[03:12.000 --> 03:17.000]  And they tell us if we're essential or non-essential when we take our experimental franken shots.
[03:17.000 --> 03:21.000]  But Fauci, the guy openly being investigated for launching the attack on purpose,
[03:21.000 --> 03:26.000]  we know he cooked up the COVID-19.
[03:26.000 --> 03:32.000]  He said children that did not have vaccine cogs can never show their face at football or at school
[03:32.000 --> 03:34.000]  or in the track field.
[03:34.000 --> 03:36.000]  Dead, dirty little buggers.
[03:36.000 --> 03:41.000]  They got to have their little special IDs showing we put in them what we wanted to use.
[03:41.000 --> 03:43.000]  They can't show their dirty faces.
[03:43.000 --> 03:44.000]  You hear that?
[03:44.000 --> 03:49.000]  You piehole Americans cover your stinking filthy piles.
[03:49.000 --> 03:51.000]  Fauci said so.
[03:51.000 --> 03:56.000]  And if you don't do what he says, just send a cop over there and beat you with a billy club.
[03:56.000 --> 04:04.000]  Because we got plenty of video of that in Canada and Australia and Spain and UK and right here in America.
[04:04.000 --> 04:08.000]  So we're going to be breaking it all down today.
[04:08.000 --> 04:10.000]  And I'll even give you the timeline.
[04:10.000 --> 04:11.000]  We know the timeline.
[04:11.000 --> 04:12.000]  We got it from the EU.
[04:12.000 --> 04:20.000]  We got out of documents in Australia and in Canada where they would have phase one, phase two, phase three.
[04:20.000 --> 04:23.000]  In Canada by phase three, total martial law.
[04:23.000 --> 04:26.000]  And to the day the documents said they did it.
[04:26.000 --> 04:30.000]  Oh, but of course they said those documents were fake even though they were real.
[04:30.000 --> 04:33.000]  Everybody asked eight months ago whether those were real or not.
[04:33.000 --> 04:38.000]  I just search engine what was in the document and pulled up pieces of it in the EU and UN announcements
[04:38.000 --> 04:42.000]  and transcripts of speeches that premiers in Canada had given.
[04:42.000 --> 04:45.000]  Of course the damn thing was real.
[04:45.000 --> 04:48.000]  It's all in this book which I reread last weekend.
[04:48.000 --> 04:50.000]  I read this stinking thing twice.
[04:50.000 --> 04:52.000]  Makes me want to have a heart attack reading it.
[04:52.000 --> 04:53.000]  He admits the whole thing.
[04:53.000 --> 04:56.000]  He's just drooling over us and gloating.
[04:56.000 --> 05:00.000]  I want swab arrested now.
[05:00.000 --> 05:05.000]  People keep asking me, Alex, how did you predict over a year ago that food prices would explode within a year?
[05:05.000 --> 05:09.000]  Because it was in all the globalist actuaries that you shut down most of the world for a year.
[05:09.000 --> 05:14.000]  It's going to cause a collapse in food production and distribution and not just that.
[05:14.000 --> 05:16.000]  Fuel and every other major commodity.
[05:16.000 --> 05:18.000]  The globalist want to post-industrial world.
[05:18.000 --> 05:20.000]  They're hitting us with economic war.
[05:20.000 --> 05:22.000]  I told you food prices would explode.
[05:22.000 --> 05:23.000]  They're now exploding.
[05:23.000 --> 05:26.000]  Our great sponsor, my patriot, has barely gone up in price.
[05:26.000 --> 05:30.000]  Their competitors have gone up even more but they're about to go up in two weeks.
[05:30.000 --> 05:36.000]  But instead of just holding prices, they're still 10% off until Sunday evening and then it's got to go up.
[05:36.000 --> 05:42.000]  10% off at infowarstore.com, 20-20 prices in the year 2021.
[05:42.000 --> 05:47.000]  But you've got to act now and buying your food from us funds the Info War of 361.
[05:47.000 --> 05:48.000]  It's ready to ship.
[05:48.000 --> 05:49.000]  They've got it on hand.
[05:49.000 --> 05:54.000]  Get yours before the scarcity and the line start, which I think we'll see by next fall.
[05:54.000 --> 05:56.000]  Hell, a lot of shelves are already empty.
[05:56.000 --> 05:57.000]  This is crazy.
[05:57.000 --> 05:58.000]  We're being collapsed by design.
[05:58.000 --> 06:00.000]  Get ready now, preparewithallux.com.
[06:28.000 --> 06:29.000]  And the world.
[06:29.000 --> 06:36.000]  So for myself, Alex Jones, to everyone else across the planet, I salute you.
[06:36.000 --> 06:42.000]  And I thank you for joining us here today.
[06:42.000 --> 06:43.000]  Wow.
[06:43.000 --> 06:45.000]  Free bird, ladies and gentlemen.
[06:45.000 --> 06:47.000]  That free bird's going to fly.
[06:47.000 --> 06:51.000]  And there's nothing the New World Order can do to stop it.
[06:51.000 --> 06:57.000]  Their big, giant, planned, locked-down counter-offensive that I laid out in my film in-game 14 years
[06:57.000 --> 07:03.000]  ago that they lay out in their Rockefeller plan 11 years ago was very successful at first.
[07:03.000 --> 07:08.400]  But just like Napoleon and just like Hitler, bogging down in the mud in Russia, they bogged
[07:08.400 --> 07:09.560]  down again.
[07:09.560 --> 07:12.000]  And now they're going to get in trouble.
[07:12.000 --> 07:16.800]  And now we're going to launch our counter-counter-offensive against them.
[07:16.800 --> 07:19.800]  And they're going to pull up on each other dangerous evil stuff.
[07:19.800 --> 07:24.440]  But now everybody's getting wise.
[07:24.440 --> 07:30.600]  Everybody knows that the captain lied.
[07:30.600 --> 07:36.040]  And they're talking to us all like we are idiots.
[07:36.040 --> 07:42.520]  So let me give you the newsflash.
[07:42.520 --> 07:45.360]  In the great reset, and that's the guy running the show.
[07:45.360 --> 07:49.720]  He's one of the top generals along with Bill Gates and others, though Gates is being relieved
[07:49.720 --> 07:54.600]  of his command right now because he's not been a very good spokesperson.
[07:54.600 --> 08:00.160]  See, they're all psychotics and sociopaths, so they can't gauge how fake and wooden and
[08:00.160 --> 08:06.080]  in leering and jackered land and ass like an evil jack-o-lantern that Gates is.
[08:06.080 --> 08:10.520]  I mean, they don't think Schwab looks like Blofeld, which is a dead ringer.
[08:10.520 --> 08:14.360]  Only he's the cat in his lap of Dr. Evil or a James Bond villain.
[08:14.360 --> 08:19.800]  You know, the Hollywood's archetype of a James Bond villain is a guy in a suit one size
[08:19.800 --> 08:26.080]  too small with a bald head who's German stroking a cat.
[08:26.080 --> 08:31.200]  Then you add to it, we will cut the power off and take over the economy and let them
[08:31.200 --> 08:32.200]  starve to death.
[08:32.200 --> 08:36.800]  They will be scared of the virus we released, and then the cure will be much less than the
[08:36.800 --> 08:39.800]  actual virus.
[08:39.800 --> 08:47.080]  You see, people are like, well, wait, is life imitating art?
[08:47.080 --> 08:49.440]  No, no, no, no, no.
[08:49.440 --> 08:52.520]  That's not how art works.
[08:52.520 --> 08:57.760]  Art imitates how the real world works, high art does, and then the general public tries
[08:57.760 --> 09:02.560]  to imitate how the high art looks thinking that it created that.
[09:02.560 --> 09:08.640]  But I've learned being at the lowest levels, and I mean the highest, of the stinking Hollywood
[09:08.640 --> 09:16.080]  system in Washington DC and all of it, I poked around in those sewers that it's worse than
[09:16.080 --> 09:17.080]  Hollywood shows.
[09:17.080 --> 09:22.080]  Like I used to think in Hollywood movies when Robert Nieros was going, I don't want to have
[09:22.080 --> 09:23.080]  to kill you.
[09:23.080 --> 09:25.960]  I feel like you're my friend.
[09:25.960 --> 09:31.480]  That's the worst acting of how an Italian gangster would act, until I learned that that's
[09:31.480 --> 09:33.280]  actually how the real ones do act.
[09:33.280 --> 09:37.080]  I'm like, oh my God, they're actually imitating the real thing, and it's the same deal.
[09:37.080 --> 09:43.480]  I'm like, why in all these cartoons and movies does the villain brag and gloat and tell people
[09:43.480 --> 09:44.880]  why they're doing it?
[09:44.880 --> 09:50.600]  Because that's what they actually do in criminology.
[09:50.600 --> 09:53.960]  And so we got Bill Gates running around, how about I want to depopulate the earth, and
[09:53.960 --> 09:58.200]  I want to get rid of people, and then you've got this huge history banned in 30 plus countries
[09:58.200 --> 10:05.760]  from giving people sterilence in the vaccines, giving people HIV, giving people polios, the
[10:05.760 --> 10:11.040]  one where he got red-handed caught, just even admitted in Reuters, that you would officially
[10:11.040 --> 10:12.040]  admit.
[10:12.040 --> 10:16.600]  Well, Gates was programming about 10 countries, didn't give millions of people polio, no big
[10:16.600 --> 10:17.600]  deal.
[10:17.600 --> 10:24.760]  They tried to write white washes about it, but it's crazy how they just admit out of
[10:24.760 --> 10:28.560]  one side of their mouth, I want to kill everybody, there's too many people, and oh, my dad ran
[10:28.560 --> 10:35.040]  the World Eugenics Society, my mom ran the IBM Trust for Hitler, literally, I mean, Hitler
[10:35.040 --> 10:40.200]  took orders from Thomas Watson, basically.
[10:40.200 --> 10:45.520]  And she carried on the trust of Thomas Watson, what do you think the Carnegie Endowment is,
[10:45.520 --> 10:48.000]  what do you think the Ford Foundation is, and you know, I'm always telling you how the
[10:48.000 --> 10:52.880]  Carnegie Endowment's on the top, and all these other foundations operate through it, like
[10:52.880 --> 10:56.600]  Bill Gates, but Bill Gates is one of the main generals.
[10:56.600 --> 10:59.400]  And now who's the new CIA director?
[10:59.400 --> 11:06.720]  Our director of the Carnegie Endowment for Peace.
[11:06.720 --> 11:08.680]  And how do they give you peace?
[11:08.680 --> 11:16.520]  Oh, there will be peace, there'll be no more war and no more famine, because most people
[11:16.520 --> 11:21.040]  will be dead.
[11:21.040 --> 11:26.040]  So you want to know about transgenderism and human cloning and the fluoride in the water?
[11:26.040 --> 11:32.120]  It's all the Carnegie Endowment on world peace.
[11:32.120 --> 11:40.640]  By the 1920s, the plan had been 100% adopted by the robber barons of the world, the British
[11:40.640 --> 11:46.280]  Royal Family, it's all in the Royal Commission on Population 1948, it's all in the documents.
[11:46.280 --> 11:51.520]  And these guys are just carrying out the plan, and now we're just living under it.
[11:51.520 --> 11:54.680]  So, let me tell you what's going down, ladies and gentlemen.
[11:54.680 --> 11:58.240]  I always said in places where they couldn't keep the lockdown going, they already had
[11:58.240 --> 12:01.200]  actually worried out, they knew that people wouldn't put up with it, already tested it,
[12:01.200 --> 12:04.400]  already done psychological studies, that's all declassified through major universities
[12:04.400 --> 12:11.400]  around the world, that they would have a lockdown for a while, then a mask, then have small
[12:11.400 --> 12:16.120]  businesses shut down, those that followed orders, train the police and others that people not
[12:16.120 --> 12:19.520]  wearing masks or criminals, that would then be moved on to those that haven't had shots
[12:19.520 --> 12:20.520]  in the future.
[12:20.520 --> 12:26.160]  And you'll have to show your phone that you've had a vaccine to even come in, much less that
[12:26.160 --> 12:28.400]  you don't have to wear a mask.
[12:28.400 --> 12:33.240]  And then children at the school will be discriminated against by the school boards and the corrupt
[12:33.240 --> 12:37.080]  teachers union to where, oh, your child isn't, so now they've got to wear a mask, but they're
[12:37.080 --> 12:40.720]  not allowed to be in curricular activities, persecuting them because an experimental,
[12:40.720 --> 12:45.360]  deadly franken shop that doesn't even protect them hasn't been given to them.
[12:45.360 --> 12:51.000]  And then also the big globalist companies can afford to bring in new employees and go
[12:51.000 --> 12:55.480]  through the crises they've created, but smaller warehouses, police departments, businesses,
[12:55.480 --> 12:59.720]  farms, everyone wants to do the right thing and have constant PCR tests that are 99% of
[12:59.720 --> 13:01.320]  the time fake.
[13:01.320 --> 13:06.040]  You get a false positive, you're totally well, they call it asymptomatic, but then everybody
[13:06.040 --> 13:09.840]  else has to shut down the warehouse because they're all scared.
[13:09.840 --> 13:15.320]  And now you can't do business in America, but everybody else in the world is.
[13:15.320 --> 13:16.320]  You can't do business.
[13:16.320 --> 13:17.320]  We can't do business.
[13:17.320 --> 13:20.640]  Canada, Australia, New Zealand, because the globalists are bringing us under heel.
[13:20.640 --> 13:21.720]  They're bankrupting us.
[13:21.720 --> 13:22.840]  They're preparing us.
[13:22.840 --> 13:27.160]  And we need governors to come out and say that and senators and house members and Rand
[13:27.160 --> 13:29.000]  Paul's starting to do it.
[13:29.000 --> 13:32.880]  And he's, he's even passed a status now.
[13:32.880 --> 13:33.880]  Rand Paul's got the brains.
[13:33.880 --> 13:34.880]  He's got the smarts.
[13:34.880 --> 13:37.040]  He's got it all.
[13:37.040 --> 13:38.240]  And he's totally presidential material.
[13:38.240 --> 13:42.760]  He's just got to get hardcore and he's starting to say, yeah, Fauci's basically behind the
[13:42.760 --> 13:45.600]  pandemic, but did he do it on purpose?
[13:45.600 --> 13:48.080]  That's the final question.
[13:48.080 --> 13:51.000]  And then of course the punishment, whether he did it on accident and it got out is live
[13:51.000 --> 13:52.000]  in prison.
[13:52.000 --> 13:53.000]  Did it on purpose?
[13:53.000 --> 13:58.080]  Well, you know what the punishment is, but I don't want any harm to Fauci until he's
[13:58.080 --> 14:00.640]  arrested and convicted.
[14:00.640 --> 14:05.840]  And then, I mean, I think he did this on purpose to kill millions of people.
[14:05.840 --> 14:08.000]  That little criminal was involved in HIV, everything else.
[14:08.000 --> 14:11.400]  He's actually one of the top advisors to Bill Gates.
[14:11.400 --> 14:16.280]  Bill Gates sat at his fetid knee, at his scruffy, discovered knee.
[14:16.280 --> 14:21.200]  So that's all coming up and I'm going to tell you next segment how I see this going out.
[14:21.200 --> 14:27.560]  But Spain, the UK, they call it a release of the lockdown, but you got to show a scanner,
[14:27.560 --> 14:31.320]  a vaccine passport, social ID to get in.
[14:31.320 --> 14:32.560]  You get harassed.
[14:32.560 --> 14:33.560]  It's never enough.
[14:33.560 --> 14:34.560]  Now, oh, you took two shots.
[14:34.560 --> 14:38.000]  Now there's a new one you got to have and another one, another one, and it doesn't even protect
[14:38.000 --> 14:39.000]  you.
[14:39.000 --> 14:40.000]  And oh, you got to have this on a plane.
[14:40.000 --> 14:43.520]  And then there's all the maskies are like, Rachel Maddow says, I'm not taking mine off.
[14:43.520 --> 14:44.520]  I want mine.
[14:44.520 --> 14:45.520]  I'm keeping it.
[14:45.520 --> 14:49.320]  And a lot of businesses are saying, in grocery stores in Texas where I live and other, we're
[14:49.320 --> 14:53.840]  never taking them off, we like them.
[14:53.840 --> 14:57.040]  We like bacterial pneumonia like it also.
[14:57.040 --> 15:03.760]  They're going to take it off in areas of the US, still some blue cities, blue areas aren't
[15:03.760 --> 15:06.440]  big corporations aren't going to take it off.
[15:06.440 --> 15:10.520]  And then in the winter, they're going to say, Oh, flu is killing a lot and COVID popped
[15:10.520 --> 15:11.520]  back up.
[15:11.520 --> 15:12.920]  Yeah, wear your mask again.
[15:12.920 --> 15:19.840]  We're just used to like red light green light, Biden comes out and says, Oh, mask back on,
[15:19.840 --> 15:20.840]  mask back up.
[15:20.840 --> 15:21.960]  This is total.
[15:21.960 --> 15:22.960]  Drink your Kool-Aid.
[15:22.960 --> 15:23.960]  Don't drink your Kool-Aid.
[15:23.960 --> 15:28.000]  It's all Kool-Aid drinking drills like Jim Jones had them do thousands of drills four
[15:28.000 --> 15:32.240]  or five times a day over years of when he said drink the Kool-Aid.
[15:32.240 --> 15:33.680]  They all came and drank the Kool-Aid.
[15:33.680 --> 15:38.560]  And the day they put the cyanide in there, boy, everybody drank the Kool-Aid.
[15:38.560 --> 15:43.280]  This is all just when Biden says jump, you say, How high, sir, how high doesn't matter
[15:43.280 --> 15:47.760]  how nonsensical and how it's a giant lie and how it's a giant fraud or any other.
[15:47.760 --> 15:53.600]  And then the background, they're cooking up a real bio attack Gates told you, but he ran
[15:53.600 --> 15:54.600]  his mouth.
[15:54.600 --> 15:56.680]  That's why he's being relieved of command.
[15:56.680 --> 15:57.680]  We're right back.
[15:57.680 --> 15:59.960]  Stay with us.
[15:59.960 --> 16:05.360]  Bio remediation is a process used to treat contaminating water, soil and subsurface material
[16:05.360 --> 16:09.800]  by accelerating naturally occurring environmental conditions to stimulate growth of microorganisms
[16:09.800 --> 16:11.720]  and degrade targeted pollutants.
[16:11.720 --> 16:16.800]  For the first time, the bio pros are bringing to the public market a suite of bio remediation
[16:16.800 --> 16:18.840]  products to the everyday consumer.
[16:18.840 --> 16:23.520]  Their first product they are launching is called bioseptic pro, a product specifically
[16:23.520 --> 16:26.520]  designed to establish a healthy septic system.
[16:26.520 --> 16:30.880]  Bioseptic pro contains live microorganisms, not traditional enzymes like as competitors.
[16:30.880 --> 16:32.800]  This stuff lives in your septic system.
[16:32.800 --> 16:37.880]  It's really like probiotics for your septic tank and is at least 100 times more effective
[16:37.880 --> 16:42.680]  than similar microbial products due to its revolutionary patented delivery system.
[16:42.680 --> 16:47.160]  Bioseptic pro contains no chemical ingredients and no genetically modified organisms.
[16:47.160 --> 16:51.160]  Visit thebio pros.com today and protect your septic system.
[16:51.160 --> 16:53.120]  That's thebio pros.com.
[16:53.120 --> 16:57.240]  This is for anaerobic septic tanks and the job it does is unparalleled.
[16:57.240 --> 16:58.240]  Thebio pros.com.
[16:58.240 --> 17:01.760]  So what's the most important part?
[17:01.760 --> 17:03.720]  Let's say in a bulldozer running over the globalist.
[17:03.720 --> 17:08.200]  The treads, the wheels, the engine, the scoop on the front, it's all very important but
[17:08.200 --> 17:12.080]  the fuel is paramount and that's my allegor.
[17:12.080 --> 17:16.840]  Turbo force is vitamins, minerals, amino acids that synergistically work with six different
[17:16.840 --> 17:21.280]  natural forms of healthy clean energy that last for 10 hours in the average metabolic
[17:21.280 --> 17:23.040]  system metabolism of a human.
[17:23.040 --> 17:26.320]  People get 15 hours out of it, some people get about eight hours but people take this,
[17:26.320 --> 17:29.800]  people are taking sports, people cannot believe it's the best they've ever had because it's
[17:29.800 --> 17:30.960]  not high.
[17:30.960 --> 17:36.360]  Nobody puts as much product into their pre-workouts, their post-workouts, you can call us whatever
[17:36.360 --> 17:37.360]  you want.
[17:37.360 --> 17:40.160]  It's a total solution all around the best you're going to find.
[17:40.160 --> 17:43.240]  Turbo force, without you, we don't roll.
[17:43.240 --> 17:44.960]  With you, we search forward together.
[17:44.960 --> 17:46.920]  It's like the bulldozer without the diesel fuel.
[17:46.920 --> 17:49.560]  If we don't have your financial support, we will be defeated.
[17:49.560 --> 17:53.120]  If you support us and get products you already need that literally fuel your mind, it's a
[17:53.120 --> 18:03.360]  win-win, 360 together, infowarstore.com or AAA-253-3139.
[18:03.360 --> 18:29.360]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:29.360 --> 18:49.680]  And I don't need to see for miles, it's now right in my face, world government, people
[18:49.680 --> 18:53.320]  that lead it write books about how they want to be populatists and how they were going
[18:53.320 --> 18:57.800]  to launch a virus to have a lockdown to lower our carbon and teach us to have less but they're
[18:57.800 --> 19:02.440]  all ordering even bigger super yachts and jumbo jets for themselves and having four
[19:02.440 --> 19:03.600]  or five children.
[19:03.600 --> 19:07.320]  It's just you and I that can't do that.
[19:07.320 --> 19:09.000]  So let's go ahead and look at it.
[19:09.000 --> 19:14.080]  Here's COVID-19, the great recent Klaus Schwab, he had this out within a month of the pandemic
[19:14.080 --> 19:15.080]  being announced.
[19:15.080 --> 19:17.320]  And of course, it's all things he'd said for years before.
[19:17.320 --> 19:21.640]  I suggest you read it about how good the lockdowns would be to teach us to have less.
[19:21.640 --> 19:25.560]  It's all right in the conclusion of the book.
[19:25.560 --> 19:28.520]  There's a free copy of it online, you just type it in and you find it.
[19:28.520 --> 19:29.520]  Look at this.
[19:29.520 --> 19:34.000]  Blood and Guardian, the equivalent of COVID emission drops needed every two years study.
[19:34.000 --> 19:38.120]  The Guardian changed this headline, you can find them the way back machine.
[19:38.120 --> 19:44.040]  At first they said we need climate lockdowns every year but folks have the copies of that
[19:44.040 --> 19:45.040]  in fact.
[19:45.040 --> 19:48.880]  Report, world needs equivalent of pandemic lockdown every two years to meet Paris carbon
[19:48.880 --> 19:50.640]  emission goals.
[19:50.640 --> 19:54.560]  Forbes followed their lead.
[19:54.560 --> 19:57.880]  And then here's a bunch of other articles about how great it's going to be, only the
[19:57.880 --> 20:00.800]  West will make those changes when we're so clean.
[20:00.800 --> 20:07.240]  China and India make zero, the globalists are invested there and then that lowers the
[20:07.240 --> 20:08.480]  world income.
[20:08.480 --> 20:11.360]  That's a giant sucking stone, Ross Perot talked about.
[20:11.360 --> 20:14.000]  We become the third world, not the other way.
[20:14.000 --> 20:22.720]  Client Simonus want pandemic lockdowns every two years, foreign policy, CFR lockdowns have
[20:22.720 --> 20:29.680]  been amazing for the environment but COVID-19 won't heal the planet, oh that good old COVID-19.
[20:29.680 --> 20:34.480]  They told us about how it would save us and how good it is and how it's an opportunity.
[20:34.480 --> 20:40.720]  Oh, here's another one, World Economic Forum says lockdowns are quietly improving, cities
[20:40.720 --> 20:43.560]  around the world.
[20:43.560 --> 20:50.000]  What they want next is scary, oh yes, but that's okay, it's okay if they run death camps around
[20:50.000 --> 20:53.320]  the world, it's okay if they want to give us 200 square foot apartments and charge us
[20:53.320 --> 20:57.120]  the same amount for 1,000 foot, it's okay if they want to take our cars away and that's
[20:57.120 --> 21:04.040]  in the news because they're for Black Lives Matter that wants to get rid of the nuclear
[21:04.040 --> 21:07.280]  family again, that'll help everybody.
[21:07.280 --> 21:14.200]  They hide, I mean that's why every corporate ad now is black people, fighter jet ads, military
[21:14.200 --> 21:20.680]  ads, banking ads, 5G ads, it's like I'm black and I like 5G, you're like well I'd better
[21:20.680 --> 21:28.360]  be 4 5G, literally the globalists have taken black people as their political cultural camouflage.
[21:28.360 --> 21:34.040]  That's why 10.6 billion got given last year to Black Lives Matter movements by the big
[21:34.040 --> 21:40.560]  banks, 10.6 billion and of course 95% of it never went to black people, that's in big
[21:40.560 --> 21:41.560]  studies.
[21:41.560 --> 21:48.880]  It goes right back when Bill Gates or Tim Cook or Bloomberg gives money to these foundations,
[21:48.880 --> 21:55.400]  it goes right back to them tax exempt, oh I gave a billion dollars to help black people
[21:55.400 --> 22:03.800]  in Africa, give them deadly shots and it's just amazing and then I see like on Twitter
[22:03.800 --> 22:09.560]  and Facebook black groups fighting with the Palestinians to be the most abused, most woke
[22:09.560 --> 22:14.960]  group begging the UN was created by the globalists to save them, it's just totally sick and I
[22:14.960 --> 22:17.560]  shouldn't, I'm not laughing, I'm laughing and paying here.
[22:17.560 --> 22:22.480]  So let me play you some of these sick clips, this will take a few segments to get to all
[22:22.480 --> 22:23.480]  these.
[22:23.480 --> 22:30.320]  I watched it live or stay on the war room, Fox News was on in the break room and I was
[22:30.320 --> 22:38.880]  getting a glass of ice water and I watched Fox News celebrating going look at him, he's
[22:38.880 --> 22:43.880]  not wearing a mask, he came out not wearing one, he only takes it off on the stage in
[22:43.880 --> 22:48.880]  the sycophantic erotic ritual, they were like oh it's so wonderful, this is it, he's gonna
[22:48.880 --> 22:53.680]  free us and he said you don't have to wear them, you've earned the right to show your
[22:53.680 --> 23:00.400]  face, Durga, Durga, Muhammad Jihad, whoever said we wouldn't have Sharia law, it's called
[23:00.400 --> 23:08.760]  COVID law, we're all post COVID now and then he went on to really make these disgusting
[23:08.760 --> 23:14.400]  orwellian comments, he also said please treat people that want to keep wearing their babas,
[23:14.400 --> 23:20.520]  their little dirty bacteria diaper, please treat them nice, they're scared, oh oh and
[23:20.520 --> 23:29.120]  on transportation buses, trains, ships and planes, you're still gonna wear them, hahaha
[23:29.120 --> 23:37.280]  sorry, I'm turning into Woody Whipbecker here because this is so crazy, it's such a cult
[23:37.280 --> 23:42.760]  takeover and it's all in operation lockstep 2011, how they create fear, set up liberal
[23:42.760 --> 23:49.120]  authoritarianism, create a world tracking ID and now Klaus Schwab says first you wear bracelets
[23:49.120 --> 23:57.280]  and then you will get implantable chip, within five years you will all have chips, oh he
[23:57.280 --> 24:03.320]  said that five years ago, five years ago he said ten years, now it's five, he's like there
[24:03.320 --> 24:10.480]  will be a deadly virus and you'll have a world ID card for your health and then there will
[24:10.480 --> 24:16.160]  be chip on your bracelet, chip in your clothing and chip in your brain, everyone will have
[24:16.160 --> 24:25.560]  chip, we will merge you with chip, the virus coming, get ready, it's going to be good,
[24:25.560 --> 24:31.920]  now I'm gonna have an Asian-European voice on a German one but it's going to be nice
[24:31.920 --> 24:38.040]  for you to get your brain chip, I am Klaus Schwab, you are non-essential, that's liberal
[24:38.040 --> 24:49.440]  now, just go in your house and stop doing that, hahaha you don't need jobs no more,
[24:49.440 --> 24:55.480]  I look like vampire, no vampire bath, alright I'm gonna stop joking, it's not a matter,
[24:55.480 --> 25:00.400]  here is, oh by the way the top story on info wars is not even all this, I'm sorry, can we
[25:00.400 --> 25:08.520]  put the live show feed up please, it's evidence overwhelmingly shows now and I've got a giant
[25:08.520 --> 25:15.440]  stack confirming it, law enforcement's investigating that Dominion wiped all the servers illegally
[25:15.440 --> 25:20.200]  after the election and covered up the paper trail, of course we knew that and now by the
[25:20.200 --> 25:24.360]  hand counts they found that Trump won by a giant landslide and the same tax we use in
[25:24.360 --> 25:30.400]  every other state that they stole the election, Friday live Arizona investigation confirms
[25:30.400 --> 25:37.360]  systematic fraud, Trump clear winner, the tactics formula used to steal Arizona mirror
[25:37.360 --> 25:44.320]  what transpired in other battleground states and then this is a much watched list in addition
[25:44.320 --> 25:50.200]  of the live radio show, globalist document show that they're planning, more locked down
[25:50.200 --> 25:54.520]  soon, tune in and find out, so here's the thing, I'm gonna be a good boy, I'm gonna
[25:54.520 --> 26:00.520]  go to break it, I'm gonna hit the COVID news judiciously, judiciously, like a news person
[26:00.520 --> 26:06.080]  and behave myself, this is getting too crazy right now, too fruity and then I'll hit that
[26:06.080 --> 26:09.760]  huge election news after that and open the phones up with a balanced broadcast, we have
[26:09.760 --> 26:13.440]  a doctor coming on with a new, just a new big study that what we already see in front
[26:13.440 --> 26:16.840]  of your eyes that the vaccines are killing way more people than COVID did and they're
[26:16.840 --> 26:21.560]  calling people that have COVID that's actually killing them, they're calling it COVID once
[26:21.560 --> 26:26.000]  the vaccines and now we even have a major medical study showing it, so God help us,
[26:26.000 --> 26:29.560]  I mean that's what's crazy is they really did it, I mean they are really killing a
[26:29.560 --> 26:33.880]  crap load of people right now with these damn vaccines and maiming tons of others and maybe
[26:33.880 --> 26:37.000]  you don't care about those people because they're too dumb, you know, and took it or
[26:37.000 --> 26:42.200]  too trusting but it's gonna weigh the economy down, a bunch of them are gonna be zombies
[26:42.200 --> 26:47.800]  now with the strokes and stuff, they're gonna be changing their diapers for 20 damn years
[26:47.800 --> 26:53.360]  all because of fricking clowns swabbing Bill Gates and fouchy, my lord, when are they gonna
[26:53.360 --> 26:58.520]  get swatting and arresting, stay with us.
[26:58.520 --> 27:03.320]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone
[27:03.320 --> 27:09.440]  for beta testing to operational, the globalists are out of the open with their planetary depopulation
[27:09.440 --> 27:13.680]  takeover, their robot takeover, but the good news is we've been working and you've been
[27:13.680 --> 27:18.000]  working and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this,
[27:18.000 --> 27:22.720]  to be able to find it off, humanity is strong, we're incredible and if we're aware of the
[27:22.720 --> 27:26.840]  attack that's happening we have a real chance of defeating it, if we ask God for guidance
[27:26.840 --> 27:31.360]  we will defeat it, so prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is
[27:31.360 --> 27:36.120]  essential and warning others is absolutely essential and at the same time supporting
[27:36.120 --> 27:40.240]  InfoWars by buying high quality products to keep us on air is essential because they're

[28:27.120 --> 28:31.840]  what you do, not because you've done something wrong but because the big telecoms, big tech
[28:31.840 --> 28:35.360]  and the globalists are predatory and are evil and in the surveillance state we need
[28:35.360 --> 28:39.760]  to more and more start doing everything we can to mitigate the criminal activity they're
[28:39.760 --> 28:40.760]  involved in.

[29:00.160 --> 29:04.360]  The globalists comprise the oldest and richest families on earth and they have brought down
[29:04.360 --> 29:07.960]  hundreds and hundreds of nations over the last thousand years.
[29:07.960 --> 29:13.160]  They have bankrupted once successful countries all across the world and they've used the
[29:13.160 --> 29:19.760]  same formulas of civil unrest and civil war and they're doing it again to the United States
[29:19.760 --> 29:24.800]  of America and Europe right now, bringing in giant third world populations and then
[29:24.800 --> 29:28.600]  brainwashing them and turning them against the country that they wanted to immigrate
[29:28.600 --> 29:32.440]  to because they knew it was better and had more freedom and more opportunity.
[29:32.440 --> 29:36.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, America is under scientific attack and it's time now more than ever to
[29:36.960 --> 29:40.720]  raise the alarm and warn everyone you know that what's really happening and at the same
[29:40.720 --> 29:44.360]  time get prepared in case things continue to go south like they are.
[29:44.360 --> 29:48.760]  One of the smartest moves out there is to get high quality, scourable food so that as inflation
[29:48.760 --> 29:52.760]  goes up it's a way to defeat the inflation and have insurance you can eat.
[29:52.760 --> 29:58.040]  So we've extended the sale through this Sunday at 10% off all scourable foods that prepare
[29:58.040 --> 29:59.040]  with Alex.com.
[29:59.040 --> 30:05.800]  One of the most popular memes on the internet in the last decade has been Alex Jones was
[30:05.800 --> 30:12.520]  right but it now routinely trends number one on platforms like Twitter and Facebook making
[30:12.520 --> 30:15.280]  the globalists pull their hair out in anger.

[30:45.960 --> 30:50.760]  This film uses their own documents and those statements 14 years ago to expose them it's
[30:50.760 --> 30:56.240]  more important than ever available at infohornsstore.com that's infohornsstore.com in-game blueprint
[30:56.240 --> 31:02.920]  for global enslavement.
[31:02.920 --> 31:32.640]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[31:32.640 --> 32:02.460]  Let's go take a break.
[32:02.460 --> 32:06.780]  what it's all about ladies and gentlemen and they're coming to take it. The only thing that
[32:06.780 --> 32:11.100]  really matters is freedom, freedom to worship God, freedom to love your wife, your husband,
[32:11.820 --> 32:15.980]  freedom to live like you want, do what you want to want, and then go where you want to want,
[32:17.260 --> 32:24.140]  but not where they want you to go. Thank you so much for joining us again on this
[32:24.140 --> 32:33.260]  live Friday Worldwide Transmission May 14th, 2021 and we have Joe Hoff joining us at the start of
[32:33.260 --> 32:39.420]  the next hour for two segments. He's really one of the leading experts as a top corporate fraud
[32:39.420 --> 32:44.620]  investigator for Fortune 500 companies. He got drafted as you know in the last year to come in
[32:44.620 --> 32:49.340]  with Jim Hoff to Gateway Pundit and they've been really the best clearinghouse of real research
[32:49.340 --> 32:57.340]  and election fraud and now the solid complete proof of fraud has been confirmed in Maricopa County
[32:57.340 --> 33:03.900]  and we'll be covering that coming up next hour. Dominion voting systems admits that they completely
[33:03.900 --> 33:09.820]  wiped everything and will not give any passwords to Maricopa County voting machines to law enforcement
[33:09.820 --> 33:15.660]  to the Senate or to the courts and now they've been doing the counting and found a 17 plus percent
[33:15.660 --> 33:21.660]  discrepancy from the totals that were put out that night giving Trump a gigantic landslide victory
[33:22.220 --> 33:27.180]  and they found the same thing spot checking Georgia the same thing spot checking Pennsylvania
[33:27.180 --> 33:30.700]  Michigan but that was never allowed to go through court it was all blocked
[33:32.060 --> 33:36.620]  and that's going to happen again so Trump responded last night to voting machine manipulation
[33:36.620 --> 33:41.100]  revealed by Maricopa County audit that was on the war room even more has come out that is
[33:41.100 --> 33:45.260]  coming up start of the next hour and then at the bottom of the hour we're going to open the phones
[33:45.260 --> 33:52.220]  up on this Friday to get your take on whatever issue you want to raise on air forget I'm Alex
[33:52.220 --> 34:01.500]  Jones your host thank you so much for joining us here today now let's start getting right into it
[34:03.100 --> 34:08.540]  this is a process that the globalists have put us into where they ratchet things down then take
[34:08.540 --> 34:12.940]  it off a little bit but never as much as it was before and then clamp back down even more and then
[34:12.940 --> 34:17.420]  release a little bit and by the time you're done a few years down the road you have a world ID
[34:17.980 --> 34:22.620]  a medical ID now you've got to have a chip under your skin to be able to get the the
[34:22.620 --> 34:26.940]  authorization to travel or have a job and then it's a chip in your brain that's what
[34:26.940 --> 34:31.020]  claus Schwab who's running this whole thing with bill gates said they're going to do
[34:31.580 --> 34:35.980]  some people keep asking how do you know what comes next I mean I've got their playbook
[34:37.180 --> 34:42.060]  in fact it's more than just if you were a football team that put spies in the stands
[34:42.060 --> 34:49.500]  during um training camp you know let's say your bella check from the new england patriots and
[34:49.500 --> 34:53.980]  that's what he would do famously everybody does it he's doing the best they've got binoculars
[34:54.780 --> 34:59.580]  they've got everything orders they have stingrays out there to grab people's cell phone traffic
[34:59.580 --> 35:04.620]  and find out what the plays are so they can recognize the formations I don't just have the
[35:04.620 --> 35:09.980]  playbook I have the blueprint like an architect of what they were going to build and how they do it
[35:09.980 --> 35:14.300]  because you know they can change plays or you don't know what play they're going to play exactly
[35:14.300 --> 35:17.900]  or maybe the play is a little bit different or maybe they know they're being spot on so they
[35:17.900 --> 35:25.180]  mix it up this is worse than having the playbook this is having the damn script and that's what's
[35:25.180 --> 35:31.660]  frustrating about it and you don't have to buy his book there's excerpts of it of claus Schwab
[35:31.660 --> 35:35.900]  great reset quotes online and you can read hours of these damn things I mean he's written a bunch of
[35:35.900 --> 35:47.420]  books shaping the fourth industrial revolution end of humans basically you might want to know
[35:47.420 --> 35:51.020]  about these people but let me do what I said I did let me let me get into this right now
[35:52.220 --> 35:57.020]  let's read some of these headlines fouchy kids still need to wear masks that's right get them
[35:57.020 --> 36:01.020]  while they're young and if you have it out of vaccine you can never take the mask off to put
[36:01.020 --> 36:06.060]  the kids in their own special areas like jews wearing yellow stars in nazi germany unvaccinated
[36:06.060 --> 36:11.500]  children still need to wear masks especially indoors fouchy the guy under investigation
[36:11.500 --> 36:17.180]  were deliberately releasing covid-19 and getting all this power who then owns a major position in
[36:17.180 --> 36:23.900]  four of the vaccines so does bill gates he owns a bigger position I mean he has a motive he has a
[36:23.900 --> 36:27.980]  conflict of interest he has a long history of cover-ups they did cover up they ran the lab they
[36:27.980 --> 36:36.940]  funded the gain of function the only questions they do it on purpose that's like asking did I
[36:36.940 --> 36:40.300]  get in bed with my wife and make my four-year-old daughter four and a half years ago I mean you
[36:40.300 --> 36:46.700]  know I mean come on folks it's ridiculous of course they did it on purpose they just think
[36:46.700 --> 36:52.140]  we're too stupid doing about it well let's show them they're wrong yankee supper covid

[47:44.780 --> 47:50.220]  everybody at a spiritual level understands what's going on i mean look at their front man look at
[47:50.220 --> 47:59.260]  this dead husk of a creature this this this mummy this this stuffed skin just the skin of an old
[47:59.260 --> 48:06.220]  dead man filled with with the cabbage leaves that is joe biden saying you've earned the right to show
[48:06.220 --> 48:12.140]  your face by submitting to marshal law and hen pecking and dangerous genetically engineered
[48:13.500 --> 48:19.340]  concoctions paid for and developed by a man that says he wants to kill you named bill gates here it
[48:19.340 --> 48:28.140]  is you know some may say just feel more comfortable continuing to wear a mask they may feel that way
[48:28.860 --> 48:34.700]  so if you're someone with a mask you see them please treat them with kindness and respect
[48:34.700 --> 48:41.420]  we've had too much conflict too much bitterness too much anger too much politicization of this
[48:41.420 --> 48:50.300]  issue about wearing masks let's put it to rest let's remember we're all americans let's remember
[48:51.020 --> 48:59.740]  that we are all in this together if you're fully vaccinated and can take your mask off
[48:59.740 --> 49:05.340]  you've earned the right to do something that americans are known for all around the world
[49:06.540 --> 49:10.220]  greeting others with a smile with a smile
[49:13.500 --> 49:17.580]  there are so many lies just about 42 seconds that i could spend an hour on them
[49:19.340 --> 49:20.700]  but but did you catch it all
[49:20.700 --> 49:29.740]  well truly truly night marriage this is how it works
[49:30.780 --> 49:36.060]  barack obama would come out and say we need unity and racial love and everybody's like yeah
[49:36.060 --> 49:41.580]  oh he's a good guy well all his surrogates and his people van jones and all of them created
[49:41.580 --> 49:47.580]  racial division and said whites were inherently bad and now you see that on steroids because
[49:47.580 --> 49:51.180]  obama can hide behind his puppet kamala harris and joe biden
[49:53.500 --> 49:56.540]  obama created division that was his job that's what the globalists want
[49:57.660 --> 50:03.420]  but then oh obama or biden they get up and like oh come on you've had enough problems with the mask
[50:03.420 --> 50:07.820]  and all this enough division let's come together i'm letting you take it off now which he shouldn't
[50:07.820 --> 50:12.460]  have that power he doesn't have that power it's a user patient it's a fraud and they're cementing
[50:12.460 --> 50:20.060]  that power that your islamic lord it's like the husband of a wife and he tells her when she can
[50:20.060 --> 50:26.780]  take the burqa off and he says when she puts the burqa back on or like a pimp tells a woman
[50:26.780 --> 50:32.300]  how much money she gets to keep from each john she's with i mean this is sick this is crazy
[50:32.300 --> 50:38.300]  this isn't liberal like more freedom this is authoritarianism and it's all based on lies
[50:38.300 --> 50:44.300]  and you talk to a leftist you go hey the vaccine doesn't protect you hey it's experimental hey these
[50:44.300 --> 50:48.940]  studies the founcy funded senate gives people heart attacks shut up you don't know science you're not
[50:48.940 --> 50:54.620]  a scientist well interviewed like 20 of them shop they need to be censored they're a bunch of coax too
[50:56.860 --> 51:02.220]  i love the fbi i love the cia i'm a liberal i love war i love torture i love i love because
[51:02.220 --> 51:07.020]  you pretend you're part of the power structure they're pathetic people but let's move on from
[51:07.020 --> 51:09.980]  them it's those of us that understand us have to mobilize against them
[51:12.700 --> 51:18.780]  here's singing in unvaccinated children will need to wear mask when playing and particularly indoors
[51:18.780 --> 51:23.260]  says dr fouchy who's been involved in all sorts of crime he's invested in the vaccines
[51:23.980 --> 51:29.180]  conflict of interest he's making money off of it he's involved in the cover-up he lies to congress
[51:29.180 --> 51:33.020]  as he didn't fund gain a function when they've released the receipts for millions of dollars
[51:33.020 --> 51:40.380]  and he did my god but he says and then the left follows him and the school boards following him
[51:41.020 --> 51:45.420]  muzzling your children it's not nothing put them on riddling and prozac and all these drugs are in
[51:45.420 --> 51:50.540]  such a cult but now they got to wear a mask in the public schools with all the spoiled
[51:50.540 --> 51:56.780]  communists and leftists that teach them and everybody bows the political correctness so
[51:56.780 --> 52:01.900]  the left will leave us alone they don't leave us alone when you bow they always want more more
[52:01.900 --> 52:08.060]  because they're the corporate ideology to take the planet over they're going to make your child get
[52:08.060 --> 52:15.820]  sterilized it's not about gay rights it's about exterminism it's about that's the cult of the
[52:15.820 --> 52:21.900]  new world order is sex to control people and to get in our bedrooms and to obsess over it
[52:22.940 --> 52:27.100]  pucker curls who talked about last night when they're teaching pedophilia in the public schools
[52:27.100 --> 52:35.020]  because it's about killing the youth and their future so here's Fauci on CNN what is your message
[52:35.020 --> 52:40.300]  to parents who are out there thinking well i'm vaccinated my kids are not but the odds of them
[52:40.300 --> 52:45.580]  getting the virus are very low would you tell them no no no the kids still need to wear a mask
[52:46.700 --> 52:51.340]  yeah the the children do when they're out there playing with their friends and you know in
[52:51.340 --> 52:56.940]  in particularly in an indoor situation they do but you know one of the things that's also important
[52:56.940 --> 53:04.700]  that's happened most recently is the approval of vaccines for children 12 to 15 years old and then
[53:04.700 --> 53:12.060]  we are also doing studies now in an age de-escalation from 12 to 9 9 to 6 6 to 2 and then 6 months to
[53:12.060 --> 53:17.900]  2 years so that we'll be able hopefully by the end of the year to be able to vaccinate children of
[53:17.900 --> 53:24.380]  any age but right now the 12 to 15 year olds are eligible to get vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine
[53:24.380 --> 53:30.380]  so that's another good news story in all this so so you can't just like biden actually said in
[53:30.380 --> 53:35.900]  the speech you can't take the mask off whether you're two years old or 50 till you've taken the
[53:35.900 --> 53:40.540]  so-called vaccine i mean this is a total nightmare takeover ladies and gentlemen
[53:41.900 --> 53:47.500]  i've got another Fauci clip here Fauci throwback we will vaccinate school aged children and six
[53:47.500 --> 53:51.660]  month old babies you know he just said it you don't need to hear it again but these people are out of
[53:51.660 --> 53:56.220]  control all right ladies and gentlemen i want to talk about a couple things here with you i'm
[53:56.220 --> 54:01.900]  extremely excited about new ionized fizzy magnesium naturally flavored orange drink
[54:01.900 --> 54:05.820]  this has two different types of magnesium for some reason the other competitors don't
[54:05.820 --> 54:10.780]  it makes a really wonderful type of magnesium i already love magnesium drinks and i forget to
[54:10.780 --> 54:14.780]  take them i really feel the loss of energy notice i've been bouncing off the walls lately because

[56:53.980 --> 56:59.180]  would like to say first off thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity
[56:59.180 --> 57:04.060]  wanted to warn people i've been trying to get a hold of you for a year okay i'm a double amputee
[57:04.060 --> 57:10.700]  and i have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away uh living defense saved my life
[57:10.700 --> 57:16.540]  they had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me living defense brought me back
[57:16.540 --> 57:22.460]  i wanted to just quote from the bible jesus is saying as to where we are right now this is
[57:22.460 --> 57:30.460]  matthew 24 verse 9 then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall
[57:30.460 --> 57:37.180]  be hated of all nations for my name's sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray one
[57:37.180 --> 57:42.540]  another and shall hate one another that's right where we're at brother and that's because god's
[57:42.540 --> 57:46.700]  name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say and that's why the enemy hates it
[57:46.700 --> 57:55.340]  because god created this country you're listening to the alex jones show
[58:01.980 --> 58:06.220]  all right we're into hour number two some stations don't carry this short segment so i'm gonna just
[58:06.220 --> 58:11.180]  play a special report that i want to analyze and then joe hoff with undoubtedly there's been a lot
[58:11.180 --> 58:16.620]  of big news the biggest news yet on the stolen election of 2020 and and where that's going just
[58:16.620 --> 58:20.140]  unbelievable developments and the tip of the spirit from gateway pundit dot com on that
[58:20.140 --> 58:24.940]  but i i happened last night to be surfing youtube and i came across this cbs news report
[58:25.500 --> 58:29.180]  that made me physically ill to watch but it still has to be seen i'm not going to play the whole
[58:29.180 --> 58:33.340]  thing it's like five minutes long we'll play about three and a half minutes over here um and i'll
[58:33.340 --> 58:37.020]  give you the title of it if you want to go on youtube and watch the watch the whole thing town
[58:37.020 --> 58:42.860]  with one covid 19 case still facing crippling effects of pandemic no crippling effects of being
[58:42.860 --> 58:49.020]  under siege under martial law canada doesn't even let people basically go outside there but it also
[58:49.020 --> 58:53.900]  borders the us so this woman can't go see her family and they won't let her across to see her
[58:53.900 --> 58:59.420]  dentist and she puts up with it so again and people watch this on the news around the world
[58:59.420 --> 59:07.820]  think this is normal the martial law in canada the martial law in australia it's bs and they're
[59:07.820 --> 59:14.380]  using it for total control and for surveillance so here is just a great window into stock home
[59:14.380 --> 59:22.300]  syndrome and what happens uh when women follow the every order of the state canada could decide any
[59:22.300 --> 59:28.860]  day now if it will reopen its us border or extend the more than year-long shutdown because of the
[59:28.860 --> 59:34.460]  continuing pandemic point roberts washington in particular has been a hard hit by the way hit
[59:34.460 --> 59:39.900]  pause again it hit pause again just back up from the beginning again it's not the pandemic it's not
[59:39.900 --> 59:44.620]  an ongoing pandemic london hasn't had one covid death in a couple weeks and it's still locked
[59:44.620 --> 59:50.860]  down basically it's all lies it's a power grab telling you you're not essential good sorry here's
[59:50.860 --> 59:57.580]  the report and in particular has been a hard hit by the closure it's on a peninsula connected to
[59:57.580 --> 1:00:04.700]  canada and separated from the us by the pacific ocean even though it's only had one covid case
[1:00:04.700 --> 1:00:11.100]  many are worried that point roberts could turn into a covet ghost town christ van cleave shows us why
[1:00:13.500 --> 1:00:20.940]  this is how pamela robertson sees family during the pandemic how are you six feet apart and a
[1:00:20.940 --> 1:00:29.260]  country away pamela in the u.s her daughter in canada separated by a border that remains closed
[1:00:29.260 --> 1:00:35.660]  to all but essential travel even if the border is just a yellow concrete barrier as far as i'm
[1:00:35.660 --> 1:00:40.940]  concerned it's essential as far as i'm concerned they should get me in but pamela was turned away
[1:00:40.940 --> 1:00:46.140]  by canadian border guards when she tried to see her dentist about an abscess an infection that
[1:00:46.140 --> 1:00:51.420]  caused the sight of her face to swell and could turn into a serious health risk if left untreated
[1:00:51.420 --> 1:00:59.500]  i asked him what was essential in their eyes and he said to me um unfortunately you have to be like
[1:00:59.500 --> 1:01:07.500]  dying she lives in point roberts a small picturesque seaside town of about 1100 with sweeping views
[1:01:08.060 --> 1:01:12.860]  pre-covid it would quadruple in size every summer as canadiens flocks out of the border
[1:01:12.860 --> 1:01:18.140]  point roberts is a bit of a geographical oddity lying just south of the 49th parallel
[1:01:18.700 --> 1:01:24.220]  it is a u.s x-clave part of washington state but completely disconnected from the u.s
[1:01:25.340 --> 1:01:33.260]  so to get to a dentist pamela has to cross the border are you frustrated are you angry i can't
[1:01:33.260 --> 1:01:37.820]  be angry because i know that the country is trying the best to keep coveted bay i'm just
[1:01:37.820 --> 1:01:43.260]  frustrated with the system while covet remains a major concern in neighboring british columbia
[1:01:43.260 --> 1:01:48.380]  point roberts has had only one case in more than a year still this small community has
[1:01:48.380 --> 1:01:53.340]  been locked out of essential needs there's no full-time doctor there's no dentist there's no
[1:01:53.340 --> 1:01:59.020]  veterinarian there's not even a pharmacy you can see why the people who call point roberts home
[1:01:59.020 --> 1:02:05.420]  are worried it could become a covet ghost town i had six customers on sunday how does that
[1:02:05.420 --> 1:02:15.260]  compare to a normal sunday before covet i would have upwards of 30 40 60 yeah i threw up there
[1:02:15.260 --> 1:02:21.420]  three and a half years ago on a sea plane out of seattle beautiful super gorgeous part of the

[1:05:29.980 --> 1:05:35.980]  once that evidence fully certified now we've got breaking gateway punnet dot com dominion voting
[1:05:35.980 --> 1:05:43.180]  systems releases statement swams arizona forensic audit and states company will not release
[1:05:43.180 --> 1:05:48.460]  passwords to maricopa voting machines that's jim hoff owner founder of gateway punnet we have his
[1:05:48.460 --> 1:05:53.660]  brother there's a forensic fraud investigator who's really the expert joining us breaking significant
[1:05:53.660 --> 1:06:01.020]  discrepancies just covered in arizona audit ballots of up to 17.5 percent likely joe biden
[1:06:01.020 --> 1:06:07.340]  did not win law enforcement now investigating the fact that the servers were wiped illegally
[1:06:07.340 --> 1:06:13.260]  breaking trump responds to 17.5 ballot pregnancy in arizona claimed that biden likely did not win
[1:06:13.260 --> 1:06:18.300]  the state stacey abrams is still fighting her loss three years later in georgia says though when
[1:06:18.300 --> 1:06:26.300]  republicans do it it's white supremacist az recount continuation of the insurrection that video of
[1:06:26.300 --> 1:06:31.260]  that so joining us to lay out the latest developments is joe hawk thank you for coming on
[1:06:31.260 --> 1:06:37.820]  yeah it's great to be here alex you you really got your nose the grindstone so does your brother
[1:06:37.820 --> 1:06:43.420]  i think gateway punnets the best place for overall accurate analysis well i mean to me this is the
[1:06:43.420 --> 1:06:50.940]  biggest news yet what do you think um yeah absolutely alex um a lot going on in arizona
[1:06:50.940 --> 1:06:56.380]  you and and here's here's why we know it's one of the biggest things to hit is because the uh
[1:06:56.380 --> 1:07:03.420]  the dnc sent like something like a hundred or so uh attorneys uh down to uh down to arizona to try
[1:07:03.420 --> 1:07:09.020]  to stop this thing mark aliases down there he's been the instigator and the leader behind the all
[1:07:09.020 --> 1:07:15.980]  the uh lawfare uh efforts to try to steal this election he was successful in getting individuals
[1:07:15.980 --> 1:07:22.940]  to sign off on these insane um rules concerning absentee ballots and drop boxes before the election
[1:07:22.940 --> 1:07:29.420]  when they didn't have the authority to do so and um and we've seen a number of republicans
[1:07:29.420 --> 1:07:38.620]  uh like in arizona a fight back against audits etc so the the the big thing uh in arizona is
[1:07:38.620 --> 1:07:43.660]  is maricopa county and i i'll just kind of give you a couple statistics about why it's so important
[1:07:43.660 --> 1:07:49.500]  there um maricopa county is where phoenix is located and it's like 60 of the entire population
[1:07:49.500 --> 1:07:54.940]  in the state and um it's traditionally gone republican it's gone republican since uh
[1:07:55.580 --> 1:08:03.100]  harry truman and joe biden miraculously somehow won maricopa county in this year's election he ends
[1:08:03.100 --> 1:08:09.260]  up beating trump by something like 40 000 or so votes in the county which ended up allowing him to
[1:08:09.260 --> 1:08:17.660]  win the uh vote in arizona by 10 000 votes um so first the first democrat to win maricopa since
[1:08:17.660 --> 1:08:25.580]  truman the first democrats win arizona since maybe uh one of the clinton years um he had
[1:08:25.580 --> 1:08:33.180]  joe biden had 150 of the total votes that hillary did in maricopa county and of course nobody believes
[1:08:33.180 --> 1:08:37.900]  that not if they're being honest joe biden was not more popular than hillary clinton
[1:08:37.900 --> 1:08:44.540]  and there was no enthusiasm behind uh biden as well we reported on this at the time there was a
[1:08:44.540 --> 1:08:52.380]  event that biden and harris held in phoenix like three weeks before the election and and and a
[1:08:52.380 --> 1:08:58.620]  local newscast uh late woman is there and she's uh saying this is really weird i'm across the street
[1:08:58.620 --> 1:09:06.140]  from by where biden and harris are and the parking lot's empty nobody's there and that was biden and
[1:09:06.140 --> 1:09:15.740]  yet that at that same time period a 95 mile long trump car parade was created over a weekend a couple
[1:09:15.740 --> 1:09:21.980]  weeks before the election not related to the party not related to the trump campaign it was just
[1:09:21.980 --> 1:09:30.060]  individuals in arizona that were behind trump 95 mile long car parade and they're telling us
[1:09:30.060 --> 1:09:39.900]  us that joe biden beat donald trump in maricopa county the first democrat since the 1940s it is
[1:09:39.900 --> 1:09:45.980]  an absolute lie so we know just looking at the big numbers this doesn't make any sense and i'll
[1:09:45.980 --> 1:09:51.500]  i'll compare this to my you know use my auditor hat and you know alex i've mentioned before i've
[1:09:51.500 --> 1:09:57.740]  done hundreds of audits around the world i was stationed in hong kong for 10 years i i got a
[1:09:57.740 --> 1:10:03.580]  background in corporate finance etc and one thing i've raised on this show before too alex as you
[1:10:03.580 --> 1:10:11.100]  remember is the major failing and and actually the accomplice that not just the big media was in the
[1:10:11.100 --> 1:10:19.020]  steel and big tech but our justice system because they did nothing as instant after instant after
[1:10:19.020 --> 1:10:24.300]  instant occurred and and in the corporate world i mentioned this before alex if there's just a
[1:10:24.300 --> 1:10:29.500]  fraud of one dollar or five million dollars it goes straight to the top it goes to the audit
[1:10:29.500 --> 1:10:35.500]  committee of the corporation there's a mandate that it's discussed it's talked about the what's
[1:10:35.500 --> 1:10:43.580]  happened needs to be defined and resolution has to be put in place such that the top people in the
[1:10:43.580 --> 1:10:50.700]  corporation are confident this won't happen again that's just with minor things of fraud and let's
[1:10:50.700 --> 1:10:56.140]  expand on that we now have even CNN cook polls show 70 percent of republicans think it was stolen
[1:10:56.140 --> 1:11:00.540]  30 percent democrats other scientific polls are upwards of 70 percent of the public in general
[1:11:00.540 --> 1:11:05.260]  of both parties so people aren't buying this we know it's illegitimate you couldn't even get 20
[1:11:05.260 --> 1:11:11.740]  people to his rallies he didn't get nine million more votes than obama or or or or all of this it's
[1:11:11.740 --> 1:11:18.380]  pure bull and so so expanding on that um now that this is coming out and they've tried to block it
[1:11:18.380 --> 1:11:23.260]  it what what do you predict is going to happen though when they show the proof of this fraud
[1:11:23.260 --> 1:11:27.580]  which mirrors the fraud that you and others uh discovered the same pattern in the other battle
[1:11:27.580 --> 1:11:33.020]  ground states that when the polls closed trump was winning by much bigger numbers uh than four years
[1:11:33.020 --> 1:11:38.700]  ago yeah and like in arizona these people that were there on site one woman there was an under
[1:11:38.700 --> 1:11:43.660]  testimony under all swore that she's telling the truth uh in front of ruby juliani says hey
[1:11:43.660 --> 1:11:48.940]  dominion was running the show we nothing happened without dominion they're telling us what to do
[1:11:48.940 --> 1:11:54.220]  she said they were the ones doing the adjudication and at times she thought i think they were the
[1:11:54.220 --> 1:11:58.860]  only ones they're doing it and what that means and here's something that i i reported on and this
[1:11:58.860 --> 1:12:04.700]  was what was noted this week in arizona is that there's this adjudication ability in these machines
[1:12:04.700 --> 1:12:11.340]  that dominion has built and maybe others the system where if there's a a ballot that's in question as
[1:12:11.340 --> 1:12:18.700]  far as who the person voted for they go to this special person it should be two people that look at
[1:12:18.700 --> 1:12:26.060]  that the the ballot and then make and you know define what the uh correct answer was but these
[1:12:26.060 --> 1:12:32.060]  machines they don't they don't keep track of who made the decision whether it was two people and
[1:12:32.060 --> 1:12:40.300]  the date and time etc of each vote that goes to adjudication because that is missing in these systems
[1:12:40.300 --> 1:12:46.860]  i believe they should never be used until that is fixed because we cannot have people random people
[1:12:46.860 --> 1:12:52.380]  making decisions on how somebody voted without there being controls in place to prevent that so
[1:12:52.380 --> 1:12:58.860]  that's what we've written about so what happens two days ago is the senate comes out with a report
[1:12:58.860 --> 1:13:03.980]  and they had sent it to the maricopa county board of supervisors of which which it's a majority
[1:13:03.980 --> 1:13:09.020]  republican and these are the same guys that have done everything they could to delay this audit
[1:13:09.020 --> 1:13:14.140]  stopped this audit now they got a hundred uh attorneys down there and by the way there's
[1:13:14.140 --> 1:13:21.020]  been letters coming from these major uh democratic what we call non-profits saying democratic
[1:13:21.020 --> 1:13:28.460]  non-profit is an oxymoron because you cannot be democrat or have an agenda a political agenda
[1:13:28.460 --> 1:13:33.740]  for one party or the other and be considered a non-profit so that's happening all over the place
[1:13:33.740 --> 1:13:39.580]  republicans don't even touch that it's it's massive fraud but the letters are going to the
[1:13:39.580 --> 1:13:45.820]  doj even last week coming from uh three of these major firms and one of the ladies who signed one
[1:13:45.820 --> 1:13:53.420]  of for one of these uh non-profits she's the daughter of clain whose biden's chief of staff so there's
[1:13:53.420 --> 1:13:57.420]  a lot there let's come back and talk about the latest developments stay there please again i don't
[1:13:57.420 --> 1:14:02.380]  like to lecture people i'm a very private person but because of the globalist their attack on humanity
[1:14:02.380 --> 1:14:07.020]  i've been forced the last 27 years to be a public figure and we've given the globalist one hell of
[1:14:07.020 --> 1:14:12.380]  a run for their money because of god and i know some of our listeners get mad when i talk about god
[1:14:12.380 --> 1:14:16.060]  all day but just give me a break the satanism's out in the open i've always been a christian but
[1:14:16.620 --> 1:14:20.860]  now the fact that it's a fight between good and evil is so clear and i get it a lot of you've
[1:14:20.860 --> 1:14:26.380]  been turned off by big churches a lot of you've been turned off by the corrupt priest class system
[1:14:26.380 --> 1:14:31.820]  and i get it me too believe me i'm one of them but it's that relationship with god and just
[1:14:31.820 --> 1:14:37.820]  god's universe that god created that is so essential and and god created the universe
[1:14:37.820 --> 1:14:41.900]  for us to have communion with god through and to have life and so that's what info wars is

[1:15:57.500 --> 1:16:02.780]  14 months ago i began to see on the broadcast every day when the first world collapses the third
[1:16:02.780 --> 1:16:08.540]  world dies we have such a complex civilization with so many billions of moving parts that when
[1:16:08.540 --> 1:16:14.300]  you shut down the first world it causes a chain reaction that will devastate the third world and
[1:16:14.300 --> 1:16:19.580]  really hurt the first world well now you're hearing about gas shortages all over the united states
[1:16:19.580 --> 1:16:24.060]  that's because the companies and the systems and the drivers that can barely get the job done before
[1:16:24.060 --> 1:16:28.620]  delivering gas had been shut down plus the keystone pipelines have been shut down along with other
[1:16:28.620 --> 1:16:34.940]  pipelines the left is now blowing up dams across the us we're being shut down our coal power plants
[1:16:34.940 --> 1:16:40.460]  are off as well ladies and gentlemen prepare to be a total slave the third world is imploding as well
[1:16:40.460 --> 1:16:45.260]  the borders have been removed until you wake up this is a globalist chai-com takeover great reset
[1:16:45.260 --> 1:16:50.860]  you have no hope they're announcing that there will be less than two-thirds the gas needed this
[1:16:50.860 --> 1:16:55.580]  summer so they told you that you're under lockdown one way or another and cnn laughed at you and your
[1:16:55.580 --> 1:17:04.380]  family globalist puppet joe biden wasted no time blaming russia with no evidence for the shutdown of
[1:17:04.380 --> 1:17:09.340]  the east coast gasoline pipeline that goes from houston right up through new york city
[1:17:09.340 --> 1:17:14.220]  supplies more than half of the gasoline of the east coast but who is it that actually shut down
[1:17:14.220 --> 1:17:19.980]  the main pipeline from canada through the midwest to houston to refine the oil that's then turned
[1:17:19.980 --> 1:17:25.820]  into gas and simply the east coast that's right joe biden shut down the keystone pipeline right
[1:17:25.820 --> 1:17:31.820]  after it was completed joe biden did that to america he has the history he has the background
[1:17:31.820 --> 1:17:36.620]  he's the one that promised to quote get us off of fossil fuels he's the one that's trying to extend
[1:17:36.620 --> 1:17:42.300]  the lockdowns of the country remember ladies and gentlemen that the new world order wants to post
[1:17:42.300 --> 1:17:47.820]  industrial world and they want the united states europe and australia cripples of communist china
[1:17:47.820 --> 1:17:52.700]  can't be dominant it's not russia that's the enemy it's communist china and their millions
[1:17:52.700 --> 1:17:57.100]  like joe biden in control of the white house that's the facts that's the information
[1:17:57.100 --> 1:18:08.940]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:18:27.900 --> 1:18:28.940]  hi
[1:18:31.500 --> 1:18:34.460]  monday through friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. we're here live
[1:18:35.180 --> 1:18:38.860]  i'm alex jones your host thank you so much for joining us we'll be back this sunday
[1:18:38.860 --> 1:18:43.340]  four to six p.m. with the alex jones sunday edition then sunday live with only scroyer
[1:18:43.340 --> 1:18:48.540]  six to eight p.m. sunday evenings there's so much news over the weekend those are very popular shows
[1:18:48.540 --> 1:18:54.060]  people want a sunday show so we do it we've also been doing a lot of saturday special reports and
[1:18:54.060 --> 1:19:00.940]  podcasts that are very popular as well because things are moving so quickly now joe hopp is here
[1:19:00.940 --> 1:19:05.900]  and it makes my head spin to talk about this he gave some of the background these are getting in
[1:19:05.900 --> 1:19:10.780]  the new developments trump without a statement saying this shows clear fraud i mean i was reading
[1:19:10.780 --> 1:19:17.820]  even a two percent change in the vote in areas of arizona would turn this back uh to trump i mean
[1:19:17.820 --> 1:19:22.860]  none of this adds up the way the media tells us it does the media told us they were going to challenge
[1:19:22.860 --> 1:19:27.820]  trump no matter what but the but the when when when we challenge joe we're told we're insurrectionist
[1:19:27.820 --> 1:19:32.780]  stacey abrams is still challenging her election in georgia but she says if we challenge this we're
[1:19:32.780 --> 1:19:35.820]  we're white supremacist we're we're we're insurrectionist
[1:19:38.460 --> 1:19:44.540]  isn't it this two sets of uh of reality really i even today i'm driving and just thinking this
[1:19:44.540 --> 1:19:49.980]  world is absolutely upside down some of this stuff is just insane this election was totally
[1:19:49.980 --> 1:19:57.020]  insane and to see even republican leader mccartney uh the other day get up there and say uh uh we the
[1:19:57.020 --> 1:20:01.260]  elections over we know who won it's over with nobody's question oh it's worse than that exactly he
[1:20:01.260 --> 1:20:06.460]  said no one's questioning it it's not like he said hey i don't question he said no one's questioning
[1:20:06.460 --> 1:20:12.300]  it that's total gaslighting the majority of america doesn't buy it absolutely and and and you know
[1:20:12.300 --> 1:20:19.260]  what and and nobody buys him if there's no trump you know good luck mccartney he he took credit for
[1:20:19.260 --> 1:20:26.780]  winning those seats uh during this past election again another anomaly trump wins 27 of the 27 or so
[1:20:26.780 --> 1:20:33.420]  swift seats all go republican but the president doesn't win i mean trump wins 17 out 18 bell
[1:20:33.420 --> 1:20:38.540]  what bellwether counties across the country that always go with the winner and yet trump
[1:20:38.540 --> 1:20:42.940]  doesn't win i mean there's so many anomalies we know they're also got census data showing it was
[1:20:42.940 --> 1:20:46.700]  stolen but but you got cut off by the break you were getting into all the pressure they're putting
[1:20:46.700 --> 1:20:51.260]  in the justice department to try to come in and stop states from following their constitutional
[1:20:51.260 --> 1:20:55.980]  right to investigate an election and that's what they want the democrats want to cement the fraud
[1:20:55.980 --> 1:21:02.140]  of 2020 uh with this hr1 yeah well there is a little end we'll never have an election again
[1:21:02.140 --> 1:21:07.580]  and we knew this alex before you know while this you know bs was going on we knew this will be our
[1:21:07.580 --> 1:21:14.460]  last election and these republicans to think oh we can just fix this you know for next election
[1:21:14.460 --> 1:21:21.180]  we'll get it going forward to me they're insane and here's and it's because i come from a professional
[1:21:21.180 --> 1:21:26.300]  auditing background as well as finance and operations they oversaw a billion dollar entity
[1:21:26.300 --> 1:21:32.620]  with financial reporting i tell you what if an auditor went out and said okay we had a problem
[1:21:32.620 --> 1:21:38.140]  here but we're not going to look at what caused what were the issues that really caused it but
[1:21:38.140 --> 1:21:41.500]  we're going to set up we're going to go straight to our recommendations for what we're going to do
[1:21:41.500 --> 1:21:46.540]  for the future you tell that auditor go back to start you need to dig into this and tell me exactly
[1:21:46.540 --> 1:21:50.860]  what you think the auditor was getting paid off you think the auditor was getting money well there
[1:21:50.860 --> 1:21:56.700]  you go you're absolutely right alex and so getting you know getting back to arizona what what
[1:21:56.700 --> 1:22:01.980]  happened significantly this week and jim has been really pushing for this my twin brother jim who's
[1:22:01.980 --> 1:22:07.100]  the founder of the gateway pundit pushing they've got to start getting some information out from
[1:22:07.100 --> 1:22:11.980]  their effort because the democrats are going to come in and they're going to get this thing shut down
[1:22:11.980 --> 1:22:19.420]  if they're going to steal an election they're not going to allow an audit like this to to finish to
[1:22:19.420 --> 1:22:23.580]  complete and they know that they're moving heaven and earth to block it if they have nothing to hide
[1:22:23.580 --> 1:22:29.660]  why act like they're so scared they are absolutely frightened which is absolutely proof that something's
[1:22:29.660 --> 1:22:34.300]  going on again put your auditor hand on if you walk into an area somebody starts pushing back
[1:22:34.300 --> 1:22:38.380]  you know immediately you need to push harder because there's something going on there and that's
[1:22:38.380 --> 1:22:43.580]  what we're into why trump's saying this is conclusive and i agree with him if you've got dominion
[1:22:44.540 --> 1:22:48.940]  erasing the server if they weren't supposed to and you have the democrats saying before oh we won't
[1:22:48.940 --> 1:22:53.340]  give it to you but it's there i remember them saying we have all this we haven't erased it and
[1:22:53.340 --> 1:22:57.660]  people said we think they erased it now they've erased it my god that's smoking gun right there
[1:22:57.660 --> 1:23:01.420]  and and then with the audit it doesn't match up to what the computers originally said
[1:23:01.420 --> 1:23:07.660]  that's right and so the senate subpoenas the the maricopa county these five mostly republicans
[1:23:07.660 --> 1:23:13.660]  push back push back push back finally the judge steps in says no they have every right to request
[1:23:13.660 --> 1:23:18.940]  this information they've got a valid subpoena and then these guys from maricopa county don't provide
[1:23:18.940 --> 1:23:23.420]  them what they need it and it was it was it was shocking this letter it was massive and we're
[1:23:23.420 --> 1:23:28.620]  really happy that they that these guys finally did it so that americans can see and they're not
[1:23:28.620 --> 1:23:32.860]  going to get this through the mainstream but you through your own effort you can see you can go
[1:23:32.860 --> 1:23:38.140]  read the letter all the things that were missing there are a couple of just devastating items on
[1:23:38.140 --> 1:23:44.300]  that list devastating they had deleted a database and you were referring to this with dominion but
[1:23:44.300 --> 1:23:50.620]  a chunk of the database is gone and they can tell it was deleted about three days before the election
[1:23:50.620 --> 1:23:56.220]  or before the uh machines were handed over to these auditors i mean that doesn't make sense
[1:23:56.220 --> 1:24:01.260]  yes so what were they doing well it doesn't make perfect sense three days before they finally the
[1:24:01.260 --> 1:24:05.980]  court orders are handed over they go and they wipe the damn sucker so what was on those machines
[1:24:05.980 --> 1:24:10.540]  that they would go to the extent that they did to delete that information because i believe what
[1:24:10.540 --> 1:24:15.820]  they did is they broke a subpoena that's that that's that's a crime you cannot freaking do what they
[1:24:15.820 --> 1:24:20.300]  did but they also didn't provide and what was in in some of those files that they deleted
[1:24:20.300 --> 1:24:26.460]  were these adjudicated uh files the the ballots that were adjudicated there's they at least had a
[1:24:26.460 --> 1:24:31.660]  record or something of these files that's gone now so i mentioned how that whole process makes
[1:24:31.660 --> 1:24:36.620]  these machines invalid if i was working in a professional setting and the machine didn't
[1:24:36.620 --> 1:24:43.020]  have an audit record an audit trail and the ability to see the stuff in in the future what
[1:24:43.020 --> 1:24:48.540]  happened back when i shut down that system i'd say until we need we need a better system here
[1:24:48.540 --> 1:24:53.820]  they deleted all those adjudicated uh ballot files we don't know which ballots were adjudicated
[1:24:53.820 --> 1:24:59.180]  how many or when or by whom that was in the senate's report we also found out that they
[1:25:00.060 --> 1:25:07.580]  a couple days prior to this letter even that the passwords to the routers um and to uh other
[1:25:07.580 --> 1:25:13.900]  information to some of some of the system they don't have the the america county people said we
[1:25:13.900 --> 1:25:19.180]  don't have it meaning dominion is the assumption dominion has those passwords and then dominion
[1:25:19.180 --> 1:25:24.380]  comes out yesterday says we're not going to give you those passwords so that's going to be another
[1:25:24.380 --> 1:25:30.220]  issue to get at these passwords at the high level the administrative level so that they can determine
[1:25:30.220 --> 1:25:35.020]  all the information and all the things that happen another roadblock by these guys but this is
[1:25:35.020 --> 1:25:40.780]  important because no company that i'm ever aware of has a system that they don't have the admin
[1:25:40.780 --> 1:25:47.420]  rights to admin rights such at the top or you can basically do anything in that system to fix it
[1:25:47.420 --> 1:25:53.660]  if there's issues and usually the corporation that that leases the software or purchases that
[1:25:53.660 --> 1:25:58.780]  software has that ability and yet the america this is really smoking gun cover-up and then the
[1:25:58.780 --> 1:26:04.460]  evidence we do have is 17 percent anomaly against trump trump trump ends hands down
[1:26:04.460 --> 1:26:08.780]  it's the same probably saw in other states in 50 seconds where do we need to go next what what do
[1:26:08.780 --> 1:26:14.140]  you think's about to happen well we do think that probably uh biden's doj is going to do something
[1:26:14.140 --> 1:26:18.860]  to try to stop but what we've been recommending these guys down to arizona to do is have good
[1:26:18.860 --> 1:26:23.340]  records of what they have backup whatever they've done off-site to make sure that they can report
[1:26:23.340 --> 1:26:27.900]  anytime the massive amount of fraud that they've already found they've gone through like half a
[1:26:27.900 --> 1:26:34.380]  million ballots out of 2.1 million they say so far i hope it's more than that but and we need to
[1:26:34.380 --> 1:26:39.180]  know how many of those were invalid i've heard i've heard there may be something up to 200
[1:26:39.180 --> 1:26:44.380]  thousand of those ballots that might be invalid so who knows we don't know yet but that's what
[1:26:44.380 --> 1:26:50.700]  i've heard um the other thing alex real quick 10 seconds to go we we know that they don't have
[1:26:50.700 --> 1:26:54.940]  any chain of custody records don't hang up don't hang up we gotta go to break the two more minutes
[1:26:54.940 --> 1:27:02.540]  on the side we gotta hear this your brain your heart your bones your liver your eyes everything

[1:30:22.940 --> 1:30:29.260]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen the alex jones show
[1:30:32.060 --> 1:30:37.580]  joe hoft is a very calm guy he's a big corporate auditor his brother draughton he meant to help
[1:30:38.460 --> 1:30:42.220]  back with the whole covet exaggerated vs and then of course with the election
[1:30:42.220 --> 1:30:46.220]  and really the gateway pundit has been the best one-stop shop exposing all the systematic fraud
[1:30:47.260 --> 1:30:51.500]  and he's a lot like me and that he's not hyper like i am but he likes to lay out the whole
[1:30:51.500 --> 1:30:57.100]  compendium and so half the time we had with him he spent just giving us the background the anomalies
[1:30:57.100 --> 1:31:00.860]  the history and then now the big meat and potatoes so i'm gonna try to get him the floor
[1:31:00.860 --> 1:31:05.660]  and i'm gonna try to shut up for five minutes to recap the latest developments and then finish
[1:31:05.660 --> 1:31:09.740]  up with what you were trying to get to because you add these things together the hiding at the cover
[1:31:09.740 --> 1:31:14.380]  up the number showing trump one that we're getting the fact that they're desperate one of the doj to
[1:31:14.380 --> 1:31:19.580]  come in and shut it down the fact that they wiped it the not having the chain of custody i mean
[1:31:19.580 --> 1:31:24.620]  this is and now wanting to submit it in federal law to federalize elections with a federal
[1:31:24.620 --> 1:31:29.500]  dictatorship i mean this is this is incredible this this is happening they're making their move
[1:31:29.500 --> 1:31:33.980]  because there was a major political realignment america turned against globalism and leftist
[1:31:33.980 --> 1:31:40.460]  garbage it's happened all over the world not just here and so they're having to set up a technocratic
[1:31:40.460 --> 1:31:45.820]  dictatorship basically a fraud in my view so so so recap and then and they get to the final point
[1:31:45.820 --> 1:31:51.580]  but yeah and that's that's you know that's just that's so true alex and i guess here's
[1:31:51.580 --> 1:31:56.780]  here's the point that i could i could make the difference between reality which is the corporate
[1:31:56.780 --> 1:32:03.100]  world and what we're seeing right now which is the politics and this totally corrupt system
[1:32:03.100 --> 1:32:08.620]  that's running this country right now and in a corporate world if you had two divisions one
[1:32:08.620 --> 1:32:13.740]  one being an audit shop and one being a whatever the marketing group or whoever this audit team
[1:32:13.740 --> 1:32:19.420]  might be looking at and if the audit team came in and tried to get information related to their
[1:32:19.420 --> 1:32:25.180]  audit and that team didn't provide that information to the audit team uh and this had to go up to the
[1:32:25.180 --> 1:32:29.500]  board of directors and to the to the chairman of the company they'd be fired and the police would
[1:32:29.500 --> 1:32:36.060]  be gone gone you're right it's garbage what's happening here this should not be happening
[1:32:36.060 --> 1:32:40.860]  these people should be complying and the secretary of state there who sorrows fact
[1:32:40.860 --> 1:32:47.100]  her name's katie hobs she's with the the people that are pushing back if she's doing her job
[1:32:47.100 --> 1:32:51.500]  she wants to know everything that's wrong so she can fix it so that everybody has faith
[1:32:51.500 --> 1:32:56.540]  in the election and she's doing the opposite again it all tells you what's really happening
[1:32:56.540 --> 1:33:03.420]  and so the one piece the way that was noted in this letter from the senate to the to the
[1:33:03.420 --> 1:33:09.180]  maricopa county board of supervisors was that hey we've asked for what's called chain of custody
[1:33:09.180 --> 1:33:15.740]  documentation on all the ballots and you haven't provided us any so where is it what's going on
[1:33:15.740 --> 1:33:21.500]  is there any can you tell us why you haven't provided that and what this chain of custody
[1:33:21.500 --> 1:33:26.620]  documentation is is it's just a document that you fill out whenever a ballot comes in that
[1:33:26.620 --> 1:33:31.420]  needs to be moved from here to there people sign off on one end people that drop it they drop it
[1:33:31.420 --> 1:33:36.220]  off people that pick it up again they sign off on that end and you have a just like you get a UPS
[1:33:36.220 --> 1:33:40.700]  for amazon delivery the driver signs that you sign it it's a chain of custody that's right you know
[1:33:40.700 --> 1:33:46.700]  everybody that had it and when they had it and and and with their initials they signed off on it
[1:33:46.700 --> 1:33:53.900]  this is mandated in in georgia we've looked at the law there absolutely mandated that it's it's
[1:33:53.900 --> 1:33:59.180]  it's if a ballot doesn't have that information it's illegitimate it's not it's not a legal
[1:33:59.180 --> 1:34:07.660]  ballot and we found in georgia there's 355 000 ballots right now today that have no chain of
[1:34:07.660 --> 1:34:14.460]  custody documentation on them that means they're invalid and you could bet 95 to 99 percent of
[1:34:14.460 --> 1:34:20.220]  those ballots are all for joe biden same thing in arizona here they're saying we don't have any
[1:34:20.220 --> 1:34:25.340]  information on any of these ballots related to their custody and then we've got in pennsylvania
[1:34:25.340 --> 1:34:32.860]  the ups or usps driver where he's got a truckload of them and they're all scanned in against trump
[1:34:32.860 --> 1:34:40.140]  by a machine he can see it think about michigan wisconsin where they dumped 140 000 ballots
[1:34:40.140 --> 1:34:47.020]  in the middle of the night uh you know all over we that's what the republicans and people that
[1:34:47.020 --> 1:34:51.980]  want to see the truth behind these elections but they really could zero in on us let's look at the
[1:34:51.980 --> 1:34:57.100]  chain of custody documentation and every single ballot that doesn't have it we want to know what
[1:34:57.100 --> 1:35:02.140]  it is and who they voted for and we will take that those totals out of the boat because they're not
[1:35:02.140 --> 1:35:09.580]  legitimate and everybody that certified these things should be should be dealt with properly
[1:35:09.580 --> 1:35:15.180]  according to the law if you certify a fraudulent election then you should be held accountable
[1:35:15.180 --> 1:35:20.540]  and these people should go to jail in my mind how this is horrible what's happened here and the true
[1:35:20.540 --> 1:35:26.620]  winner of this election has been abused like i've never seen anybody abused in my life and it's
[1:35:26.620 --> 1:35:30.940]  donald trump in my opinion well that is they're guilty they're going for broke and they basically
[1:35:30.940 --> 1:35:35.500]  robbed the bank they're breaking the social contract in in closing you talk about chain of custody
[1:35:36.300 --> 1:35:41.500]  we know they fought tooth and nail for months to to block the senate and to block the courts and to
[1:35:41.500 --> 1:35:46.860]  block people from being able in this one county that had the most ridiculous anomalies in the
[1:35:46.860 --> 1:35:52.620]  country in a sea of a ridiculous anomalies in my view right and then talk about chain of custody
[1:35:52.620 --> 1:35:57.660]  we need to know the names of who went in three days before and wipe those computers because those
[1:35:57.660 --> 1:36:01.820]  computers are now really the chain of custody of what happened they're just as important as the
[1:36:01.820 --> 1:36:08.620]  ballots that's right alex that was a crime and and that's like obstructing justice that's like
[1:36:08.620 --> 1:36:15.340]  tampering with uh what what do we call tampering with whatever the evidence it's those are crimes
[1:36:15.340 --> 1:36:20.620]  and these people should be held accountable and if you can't in my opinion if you can't determine
[1:36:20.620 --> 1:36:25.420]  exactly who it is then you go a layer up and you go a layer up and eventually if you have to indict
[1:36:25.420 --> 1:36:29.340]  every one of those board of supervisors or do you have to indict the people from dominion
[1:36:29.340 --> 1:36:33.660]  that were involved in the case if they're at fault if we can see that then they need to be
[1:36:33.660 --> 1:36:37.500]  indicted and and we already know these guys they lie about everything one other thing i was thinking
[1:36:37.500 --> 1:36:41.260]  about the routers that they said we can't give that to you because there's personal information
[1:36:41.260 --> 1:36:46.860]  i that's garbage you talk to any IQ professional that too was garbage i'll tell you story and i'm
[1:36:46.860 --> 1:36:53.020]  no master forensics guy like you but 20 years ago we already had a shopping cart and i could look at
[1:36:53.020 --> 1:36:58.380]  the graph of stuff sold for a month on american express and about halfway through the month
[1:36:58.940 --> 1:37:04.060]  the american express orders went down about 30 percent so it was just like the biden graph in
[1:37:04.060 --> 1:37:08.940]  michigan other states is under trump and then as soon as they you know get all these magic ballots
[1:37:08.940 --> 1:37:15.260]  it goes straight up well i saw it go straight down at a date and then not get a bunch of orders so i
[1:37:15.260 --> 1:37:21.020]  did an investigation called american express they checked somebody in minnesota with my same name
[1:37:21.020 --> 1:37:27.020]  had somehow gotten in and changed but was only able to get certain amounts of the cards with
[1:37:27.020 --> 1:37:31.580]  certain prefixes i don't know how it all worked so about half of our american express orders
[1:37:31.580 --> 1:37:35.980]  were going to this guy for like a month he said it was an accident gave it back but i mean i could
[1:37:35.980 --> 1:37:40.940]  see the graph and see it went straight down that someone was grabbing those orders i called american
[1:37:40.940 --> 1:37:45.980]  express they agreed they found out it stopped so anybody can look at these graphs and see it goes
[1:37:45.980 --> 1:37:51.500]  straight up when everything else is an organic curve and then a straight up curve that's a fraud
[1:37:52.460 --> 1:37:57.900]  outrageous and you know alex we knew this we saw these charts on november 4th the day after the
[1:37:57.900 --> 1:38:04.540]  election we saw very similar charts that day we knew that there was these big dumps and and you know
[1:38:04.540 --> 1:38:09.500]  proved to us that they're valid give us that chain of custody documentation on all those ballots and
[1:38:09.500 --> 1:38:14.300]  let's not give them time to make up stuff let's let's freaking get that information right now
[1:38:14.300 --> 1:38:19.420]  and let's see and i tell you what these these secretaries of state that approved these uh
[1:38:19.420 --> 1:38:24.780]  these elections and said everything was fine knowing that they had hundreds of thousands of
[1:38:24.780 --> 1:38:29.900]  ballots without chain of custody documentation they should be held accountable they certified an
[1:38:29.900 --> 1:38:35.340]  election that was fraudulent and they knew it so that's just a simple test that could be done
[1:38:35.340 --> 1:38:40.060]  there's so much fraud and so many other ways too that needs to be looked into i think we need to
[1:38:40.060 --> 1:38:45.260]  look into every single state i think if i was any every state should contact their legislature and
[1:38:45.260 --> 1:38:51.020]  say we want to know trump won florida by four percent how much did he really win by texas how
[1:38:51.020 --> 1:38:56.380]  much did he really win by we need to look at all the states and figure out how much massive fraud
[1:38:56.380 --> 1:39:01.500]  there was the number was shocked people i totally agree with you and in closing joe at gateway punnet
[1:39:01.500 --> 1:39:06.140]  dot com we really appreciate you and your brother and your whole great team we're told we're insurrectionist
[1:39:06.140 --> 1:39:10.380]  and criminals day one even before the capital that we're not supposed to ask a question when the
[1:39:10.380 --> 1:39:15.900]  democrats hillary and all of them said we're gonna block this we think he's gonna win one way or
[1:39:15.900 --> 1:39:20.220]  another we'll never accept it and and john pedestrian was in the new york times saying we'll
[1:39:20.220 --> 1:39:25.260]  have a succession of democrat states and have our own inauguration they said one way or another
[1:39:25.260 --> 1:39:32.220]  Pelosi said trump will not be sworn in and they made good on that yeah it's just it's totally shocking
[1:39:32.220 --> 1:39:37.020]  and i remember mark finchin from arizona saying hey the thing that separates this country from other
[1:39:37.020 --> 1:39:43.340]  countries is we have the ability to go in and review elections and to audit them and to look at them
[1:39:43.340 --> 1:39:49.820]  and they need to be done by qualified auditors that will do a fair and fair and lo and behold we
[1:39:49.820 --> 1:39:53.260]  found evidence of fraud and they want to send the judge's department in joe hoff thank you so much

[1:43:05.260 --> 1:43:08.940]  i don't care about that i care about beating the new world border and it's because we have
[1:43:08.940 --> 1:43:13.900]  so much credibility they can't allow us to stay on air much longer and i don't have time to tell
[1:43:13.900 --> 1:43:17.820]  you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons i can't tell you what's going on but
[1:43:17.820 --> 1:43:22.460]  let's just say this we're going to see this through the end we're going to stay on air as long as we

[1:43:55.260 --> 1:44:02.540]  destroy everything we ever said you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:44:11.820 --> 1:44:14.060]  you look like an angel
[1:44:14.060 --> 1:44:16.060]  look like an angel
[1:44:16.060 --> 1:44:18.060]  walk like an angel
[1:44:18.060 --> 1:44:20.060]  walk like an angel
[1:44:20.060 --> 1:44:22.060]  talk like an angel
[1:44:22.060 --> 1:44:27.740]  but i got you the devil
[1:44:27.740 --> 1:44:31.820]  I was on the war room yesterday in the first hour part of it with Owen shrower
[1:44:32.700 --> 1:44:37.260]  and he made a really good point that's actually backed up by facts he said they backed off on the
[1:44:37.260 --> 1:44:41.580]  mask early because there's so much pressure to it and because people were pushing back
[1:44:41.580 --> 1:44:45.500]  they want to kill that opposition and once we dissipate our movement against them
[1:44:45.500 --> 1:44:48.220]  there's so much pressure on fouchy and others that launch the attack
[1:44:48.220 --> 1:44:56.340]  and the power grab then they'll bring it back later and Owen was absolutely right when he
[1:44:56.340 --> 1:45:01.480]  said that and I want to explain something the globalist telegraph what they're gonna do they
[1:45:01.480 --> 1:45:08.320]  were gonna announce no mask outdoors on July 4th but everybody was so pissed at him and not
[1:45:08.320 --> 1:45:15.300]  buying it and leaving their blue cities that they go okay and they did it a few weeks ago but then
[1:45:15.300 --> 1:45:19.780]  people were still angry at him so they were still planning July 4th to say all right if you've
[1:45:19.780 --> 1:45:24.500]  been vaccinated you don't need to wear a mask inside to get you ready down the road to check
[1:45:24.500 --> 1:45:30.460]  your QR code that you've been vaccinated with the poison but there was so much pressure he went
[1:45:30.460 --> 1:45:37.940]  ahead and did it yesterday so your pressure is having an effect on these puppets but if I explained
[1:45:37.940 --> 1:45:42.100]  why they shut down the pipeline how I know they did it would take an hour I've already done it if
[1:45:42.100 --> 1:45:48.820]  you read in the globalist documents if you get into how they're gonna take down society they say
[1:45:48.820 --> 1:45:58.580]  carbon taxes shutting down the infrastructure with orders regulations and control and hackers are
[1:45:58.580 --> 1:46:06.060]  gonna help get us to net zero and what that means is they either do it themselves or they let hackers
[1:46:06.060 --> 1:46:11.860]  subsidiaries do it and let them get away with it there's even articles like well the hackers
[1:46:11.860 --> 1:46:18.220]  did help cut the carbon footprint so instead of like having earth first put spikes and trees so if
[1:46:18.220 --> 1:46:24.060]  you hit it with a saw it shoots out and kills you in your heart or instead of dynamiting a pipeline
[1:46:24.060 --> 1:46:30.700]  which they've done or instead of shooting at pipeline workers or like they do during riots
[1:46:30.700 --> 1:46:36.780]  shooting at firefighters and telephone repair people instead of that oh no oh hackers did it
[1:46:36.780 --> 1:46:44.060]  just a nebulous enemy that did it I watched Biden order four days five days before the storm
[1:46:44.060 --> 1:46:49.660]  hit the state of Texas said please let us take the carbon restrictions off we need to up coal and
[1:46:49.660 --> 1:46:54.500]  natural gas use you have to get an emergency authorization or there's million dollar fines per
[1:46:54.500 --> 1:47:03.900]  facility per day and if you don't tell them it's a felony you go to jail we need to repeal that crap
[1:47:03.900 --> 1:47:09.740]  people ask well why didn't they just turn the pipeline on by hand under emergency rules that
[1:47:09.740 --> 1:47:14.260]  Biden put back in place they've shut down almost all the pipelines in California they're trying
[1:47:14.260 --> 1:47:18.820]  to shut down the one in Michigan and they tell the hires up in those companies actually you
[1:47:18.820 --> 1:47:22.780]  gotta get an environmental assessment before you turn those on by hand there might be an
[1:47:22.780 --> 1:47:28.260]  accident what did Whitmer say two days ago to London Guardian she gave a speech she said well
[1:47:28.260 --> 1:47:34.540]  it's never had an accident but I'm scared the hackers might get it oh so they might shut it
[1:47:34.540 --> 1:47:39.020]  down so we better it's like oh if I have a child they might die in a car wreck you know when
[1:47:39.020 --> 1:47:42.900]  they're 10 years old so they're not have a child or I'm gonna not go outside I might catch a cold
[1:47:42.900 --> 1:47:50.860]  this is the crazy attitude but that's just their cover story for all this so yes yes the group
[1:47:50.860 --> 1:47:55.500]  shutting thousands of pipelines down in the West the group that shut down all the Spain's gas and
[1:47:55.500 --> 1:47:59.460]  oil basically make room to them the same one the Senate to England the same one doing it to
[1:47:59.460 --> 1:48:06.220]  Australia who said they do it yes yes they're they're behind it not some nebulous thing oh of
[1:48:06.220 --> 1:48:15.300]  course out of Russia give me a break yeah now Whitmer says okay you got a tree you can run this
[1:48:15.300 --> 1:48:24.980]  gas pipeline gasoline into the US and oil we're just gonna seize your company by the way Whitmer
[1:48:24.980 --> 1:48:33.860]  a treaty overrides a governor's fat mouth if a state wanted to secede then it could override
[1:48:33.860 --> 1:48:40.180]  the treaty oh but you'll say states can't secede you know they can in the Constitution that decision
[1:48:40.180 --> 1:48:44.580]  that that was not all cleared up with the Civil War ladies and gentlemen and I've also heard the
[1:48:44.580 --> 1:48:50.300]  national news go the chairman of the Republican Party Alan West is wrong Texas is not allowed to
[1:48:50.300 --> 1:48:57.260]  see I'm explaining to you that two states have it in their founding and in their Constitution and
[1:48:57.260 --> 1:49:05.540]  that's New Hampshire and that's Texas but that's why Texas is called the lone star state because
[1:49:05.540 --> 1:49:12.140]  it was a country and then it entered by treaty and may remove itself with a vote of the legislature
[1:49:12.140 --> 1:49:20.380]  that's in the damn entrance into the US and that's and Alan West is right but again they think you're
[1:49:20.380 --> 1:49:25.980]  stupid and New Hampshire just has a right to revolt do whatever the hell it wants which I think
[1:49:25.980 --> 1:49:32.460]  every state should have but when New Hampshire entered the Union they put in their right to
[1:49:32.460 --> 1:49:37.900]  revolt which is in our Declaration of Independence which doesn't give us the right it enshrines
[1:49:37.900 --> 1:49:44.140]  it and it points it out so long before we get violent we need to get political we need to get
[1:49:44.140 --> 1:49:49.180]  loud we need to get aggressive and we're doing that and and we're winning folks the enemy has
[1:49:49.180 --> 1:49:53.980]  counter struck as negative as all this is things are going to get a lot better now I want to open
[1:49:53.980 --> 1:49:59.260]  the phones up on any subject you want to call in about all I ask is you have a good clean phone and
[1:49:59.260 --> 1:50:03.260]  you just make your point because I want to be the next person I respect your time we had a few
[1:50:03.260 --> 1:50:06.460]  callers left on hold the other day we want to call them back get them on that's fine if they
[1:50:06.460 --> 1:50:10.460]  don't answer that's fine we'll take your calls at eight seven seven seven eight nine two five
[1:50:10.460 --> 1:50:13.900]  three nine eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine eight seven seven
[1:50:16.220 --> 1:50:21.580]  eight seven seven seven eight nine Alex is the number to join us then we have a doctor joining
[1:50:21.580 --> 1:50:26.700]  us who's brought out a big study that is what we already see in the news but we already can hear
[1:50:26.700 --> 1:50:31.420]  from our friends and family more people are now dying from the COVID shot than died of COVID and
[1:50:31.420 --> 1:50:35.900]  most of the people now dying in hospitals with COVID got the vaccine that's even in the news
[1:50:35.900 --> 1:50:41.340]  the New York Yankees are all getting COVID when they already took the vaccine months ago because
[1:50:41.340 --> 1:50:49.740]  it's bull if you've had the flu or had the cold in the last 10 years on average you're going to
[1:50:49.740 --> 1:50:56.060]  test positive at 40 cycles of a COVID PCR test I mean that's the inventor said that it's a fact
[1:50:56.060 --> 1:50:59.820]  but we just still go with the fraud because it's well don't question it or you're
[1:50:59.820 --> 1:51:03.820]  hurting those that died of COVID you mean died of the flu you mean died of pneumonia
[1:51:03.820 --> 1:51:07.980]  they're like well then wait you said Fauci attacked us and cooked it up no it's a real
[1:51:08.700 --> 1:51:14.300]  cold virus gain a function a nasty cold virus and if you're run down it had a heart attack and
[1:51:14.300 --> 1:51:19.180]  cancer and and don't have good absorption in your guts because of all different types of
[1:51:19.180 --> 1:51:23.580]  problems that people can have with their intestines you know Crohn's irritable bowel what's the other
[1:51:23.580 --> 1:51:30.540]  big one that family really old folks die but it's where the guts get infected the point is die
[1:51:30.540 --> 1:51:36.540]  reticulitis yes you will die from any virus so but the point is they did release it because it's
[1:51:36.540 --> 1:51:40.940]  novel and it would scare scientists when they looked at it because the damn thing's got five
[1:51:40.940 --> 1:51:45.260]  viruses in it and it's a carrier in the future for more deadly strains are going to release

[1:52:04.300 --> 1:52:09.100]  have a bigger mark to the parents all the way to have a bigger mark on somebody then the parents is
[1:52:09.100 --> 1:52:13.260]  to have sex with them or to screw with their mind sexually and and and they know how to tie
[1:52:13.260 --> 1:52:21.020]  propaganda to sex and really turn your kids into freakazoids like they are so uh that's all coming

[1:52:44.460 --> 1:52:49.740]  you all for supporting us we were in the red the first four months of this year and I prayed about
[1:52:49.740 --> 1:52:55.100]  it and thank god products that hadn't come in because the supply chain breakdown came in
[1:52:55.100 --> 1:53:01.900]  bodies came in turbo force came in winter sun came back in vitamin refusion you notice though
[1:53:01.900 --> 1:53:05.100]  that most of those are already back at regular price because they're almost sold out and then
[1:53:05.100 --> 1:53:09.100]  it's months like I can even get more because we can only get limited orders of the high quality
[1:53:09.100 --> 1:53:13.500]  stuff we've got and I'm not going to lower the formulation quality that's how I know how bad
[1:53:13.500 --> 1:53:19.020]  the breakdown is with food and everything and so I would get these products while you still can
[1:53:19.020 --> 1:53:23.260]  we got out of the red into the black but not much in the black but I want to thank you all for
[1:53:23.260 --> 1:53:28.860]  shopping with info or store.com I want to thank god for that and separately also got a side of the
[1:53:28.860 --> 1:53:32.060]  black even though we make a small percentage because the food doesn't have a lot of markup

[1:58:23.100 --> 1:58:28.780]  that's the view of some guy who's literally claiming to be a college professor but he's not alone
[1:58:28.780 --> 1:58:34.940]  people like that are in charge of the schools now low iq vandals wrecking what they did not

[1:58:49.660 --> 1:58:54.860]  of this framework is a Stanford professor called joe bowler here's how she explained the plan
[1:58:54.860 --> 1:59:00.220]  these are her words quote i'm very pleased to announce the new mathematics framework for california
[1:59:00.220 --> 1:59:07.180]  some highlights a strong social justice orientation all students should take the same courses
[1:59:07.180 --> 1:59:15.500]  kindergarten through 10th grade viva la math revolution right numbers are racist kill them it's
[1:59:15.500 --> 1:59:21.020]  lunacy it's the french revolution the stuff is everywhere have you're taking a look at the books
[1:59:21.020 --> 1:59:26.460]  that your kids are being assigned in school have you actually read them parents in loudon county
[1:59:26.460 --> 1:59:31.820]  actually did read them and one mother had the temerity to read portions of those books allowed
[1:59:31.820 --> 1:59:38.300]  at the loudon county school board meeting watch jasper wasn't even my boyfriend just this dude i

[2:00:52.940 --> 2:00:59.820]  so they're teaching little boys to get in vans with men so it's far beyond this hell they have

[2:01:59.100 --> 2:02:03.500]  within a year because it was in all the globalist actuaries that you shut down most the world for
[2:02:03.500 --> 2:02:08.780]  a year it's going to cause a collapse in food production and distribution and not just that
[2:02:08.780 --> 2:02:13.900]  fuel and every other major commodity the globalist want to post industrial world they're hitting us
[2:02:13.900 --> 2:02:18.700]  with economic war i told you food prices would explode they're now exploding our great sponsor

[2:04:39.580 --> 2:04:46.380]  adam owl killer trevor darrell taylor jeremy and others
[2:04:50.620 --> 2:04:55.580]  let's go ahead and talk to matt in our kansas you're on the air matt welcome
[2:04:57.180 --> 2:05:02.780]  hey alex thanks great to talk to you um i would encourage everyone to watch that type of carlson
[2:05:02.780 --> 2:05:06.620]  piece from last night because as parents here in kansas we're going through the exact same thing
[2:05:06.620 --> 2:05:13.740]  that those people are uh we have a local state state bill here that you can actually go to the
[2:05:13.740 --> 2:05:18.940]  schools sir they have they have middle schools where they teach people all over the country
[2:05:18.940 --> 2:05:25.020]  we started massachusetts things i can't say on air well in fact i was reading articles about this
[2:05:25.020 --> 2:05:30.540]  years ago i learned about sexual things that i didn't know about as a grown man well you'll
[2:05:30.540 --> 2:05:34.620]  find this interesting so during the course of these hearings they kept the school district
[2:05:34.620 --> 2:05:39.500]  kept basically daring the parents to them because you can never get redressed in these little hearings
[2:05:39.500 --> 2:05:45.180]  regarding the masks for the kids so we finally go to hearing of course it's denied and five times
[2:05:45.180 --> 2:05:50.220]  during our hearing they said okay then you're option is to us so we sued them well guess here's
[2:05:50.220 --> 2:05:56.780]  what's interesting the school district sends the case to federal court so i told our little
[2:05:56.780 --> 2:06:00.940]  volunteer lawyer i was like well i'm this makes me a little uncomfortable why would our local
[2:06:00.940 --> 2:06:05.420]  school district send this off to federal court because that scolds it while they continue sub
[2:06:05.420 --> 2:06:10.380]  candidate children you need to call an emergency election and remove that school board that is the
[2:06:10.380 --> 2:06:15.340]  answer but yes they use the rollout of kids can't go in schools kids can't go in middle schools they
[2:06:15.340 --> 2:06:19.820]  can't go in elementary they can't go in daycares because they're all in their teaching on the
[2:06:19.820 --> 2:06:26.060]  indoctrination right now this is all their battle plan on every front they moved against us worldwide
[2:06:26.060 --> 2:06:31.100]  with the covid shutdown still this better than anybody moving this to federal court that's
[2:06:31.100 --> 2:06:36.460]  costing a fortune and who wins say we say we win this lot sir all you do is you need to
[2:06:36.460 --> 2:06:41.580]  refollow the suit again over and over again and the federal court should kick that back down that's
[2:06:41.580 --> 2:06:46.540]  a local issue they're trying to claim there's a federal mandate but but that's still administered
[2:06:46.540 --> 2:06:50.380]  and those are guidelines i appreciate your call i could talk to everybody love you matt i appreciate
[2:06:50.380 --> 2:06:57.260]  your call but since you mentioned it i never got this this says gay man in drag tells lgbt
[2:06:57.260 --> 2:07:07.500]  supporters keep your kids out of drag queen shows uh yeah and and again um these these are not dudes
[2:07:07.500 --> 2:07:12.700]  that look like women they all look like hideous clowns i mean nothing i'm not trying to be mean to
[2:07:12.700 --> 2:07:17.900]  this guy because he's homosexual it's just that i would look hideous with with with with white
[2:07:17.900 --> 2:07:23.820]  makeup on and in a wig and again women bring their children to them like it's offerings and they
[2:07:23.820 --> 2:07:30.220]  sit on their laps i mean this is hideous and and now you see the videos of little kids up on stage
[2:07:30.220 --> 2:07:36.780]  having money thrown at them so tucker carlson is playing mild stuff on his show i have video shot

[2:08:12.780 --> 2:08:19.580]  are it the clown story times here it is telling people to keep their kids out of drag and keep
[2:08:19.580 --> 2:08:24.700]  your kids out of our gay clubs i saw that the other day there was a video of these two kids
[2:08:24.700 --> 2:08:30.860]  walking down some drag show yeah so i'm sort of blending the two messages together because i think
[2:08:30.860 --> 2:08:35.500]  at some point they do come together obviously when we're seeing twelve-year-old dresses girls and
[2:08:35.500 --> 2:08:40.540]  women are stripping for gay men throwing them dollar bills on a stage it's it's just i don't
[2:08:40.540 --> 2:08:47.420]  know why we have to us me as a as a homosexual has to tell people keep your kids out of my life
[2:08:47.420 --> 2:08:52.460]  you know keep your kids innocent and pure as long as you can and you know they'll they'll discover
[2:08:52.460 --> 2:08:57.100]  their own sex life they'll discover their own sexualities and drags out of sexuality it's an
[2:08:57.100 --> 2:09:03.020]  art form what do you feel about the whole story hour drag queen story hour oh i think it's stupid
[2:09:03.020 --> 2:09:08.380]  i i think it's damaging i think it will actually lead to more confusion of gay children yeah why
[2:09:08.380 --> 2:09:13.100]  do you have to weigh 400 pounds to dress like a woman i listen i'm not trying to be mean here
[2:09:13.100 --> 2:09:18.060]  oh i'm saying people like hey praise this guy praise kaitlyn jenner bruce jenner because he said
[2:09:18.620 --> 2:09:23.900]  don't have biological men competing with women and now it's like oh you're dressed like a girl
[2:09:23.900 --> 2:09:27.660]  but it's like oh but the election wasn't stolen and we need open borders and turn your guns and
[2:09:27.660 --> 2:09:34.140]  everyone's like all the republicans are like yes master yes master yes master whatever you say
[2:09:34.140 --> 2:09:41.820]  you're a man says you the woman yes master yes i mean it's disgusting in that i'm supposed to
[2:09:41.820 --> 2:09:49.580]  worship it and they're forcing in our children and yes the same thing is what that clown person
[2:09:49.580 --> 2:09:59.420]  was saying so even crazy clowns even crazy clowns are right you should keep your children away from
[2:09:59.420 --> 2:10:04.380]  topless bars god almighty as you imagine you walk to the topless bar they have like a 10-year-old girl
[2:10:04.380 --> 2:10:08.540]  up there having money throwing them you you'd call the police but if it's a gay bar it's like oh my
[2:10:08.540 --> 2:10:15.260]  goodness it's so liberal i mean again jim cook runs death camps in china on record the war with
[2:10:15.260 --> 2:10:19.820]  suicide nets but it's like he's gay it's like easy i mean he could freaking eat children on tv

[2:12:15.820 --> 2:12:21.980]  take info wars gold dot com uh that's uh saint joseph partners they're great they they they make
[2:12:21.980 --> 2:12:26.940]  almost no profit on the gold so uh they have to sell a lot to be able to even sponsor us but uh
[2:12:27.660 --> 2:12:32.300]  it it's it's it's it's definitely growing uh but yeah they're they're their first rate folks
[2:12:32.300 --> 2:12:37.420]  they're the only problem is keeping the gold and stock so info wars gold dot com and you notice i
[2:12:37.420 --> 2:12:41.580]  brought on a gold sponsor i brought on a satellite phone sponsor i brought on some other sponsors
[2:12:41.580 --> 2:12:48.380]  that new uh eco-friendly bacteria that blows away the enzymes for cleanup and septic tanks i
[2:12:48.380 --> 2:12:53.180]  that wasn't developed for years but that's all come online because we need to keep the show on the air
[2:12:53.900 --> 2:12:57.580]  it is a big idea a new world order
[2:12:57.580 --> 2:13:04.460]  in the near future earth is dominated by a powerful world
[2:13:05.260 --> 2:13:10.380]  it's known as the builder for both their objective be world domination
[2:13:10.940 --> 2:13:17.180]  for thousands of years their dark order grew now as they hail the birth of the new world order
[2:13:17.180 --> 2:13:23.660]  their great dream of exterminating 80 percent of humanity is in hand the globalist fear this
[2:13:23.660 --> 2:13:27.900]  film made 14 years ago it is the blueprint for their plan to figure with the world it is the blueprint
[2:13:27.900 --> 2:13:32.540]  for the great reset it is in game blueprint for global enslavement available right now at info
[2:13:32.540 --> 2:13:37.020]  war store dot com with a zero country code meaning you can make copies of it anywhere in the world
[2:13:37.020 --> 2:13:42.380]  i strongly suggest you get the film in game at info war store dot com i strongly suggest you
[2:13:42.380 --> 2:13:47.260]  make copies and share it and if you take that action i demand you tell others you've given a copy to
[2:13:47.260 --> 2:13:51.660]  that they make copies and share it as well that will trigger distribution by proxy meaning
[2:13:51.660 --> 2:13:58.940]  we the people cannot be stopped globalist puppet joe biden wasted no time blaming russia with no
[2:13:58.940 --> 2:14:04.700]  evidence for the shutdown of the east coast gasoline pipeline that goes from houston right up through
[2:14:04.700 --> 2:14:09.900]  new york city it supplies more than half of the gasoline to the east coast but who is it that actually
[2:14:09.900 --> 2:14:15.820]  shut down the main pipeline from canada through the midwest to houston to refine the oil that's
[2:14:15.820 --> 2:14:21.900]  then turned into gas and simply the east coast that's right joe biden shut down the keystone pipeline
[2:14:21.900 --> 2:14:28.140]  right after it was completed joe biden did that to america he has the history he has the background
[2:14:28.140 --> 2:14:32.940]  he's the one that promised to quote get us off of fossil fuels he's the one that's tried to extend
[2:14:32.940 --> 2:14:38.620]  the lockdowns of the country remember ladies and gentlemen that the new world order wants a post
[2:14:38.620 --> 2:14:44.140]  industrial world and they want the united states europe and australia cripples of communist china
[2:14:44.140 --> 2:14:49.420]  can't be dominant it's not russia that's the enemy it's communist china and their millions like joe
[2:14:49.420 --> 2:14:53.340]  biden in control the white house that's the facts that's the information
[2:14:53.340 --> 2:15:15.820]  you're listening to the alex jones show our lead producer scott
[2:15:16.700 --> 2:15:20.380]  just came in here and he said alex you got to remember it's not always how you fight
[2:15:20.380 --> 2:15:27.580]  it's the most important it's what you're fighting for and that's true we should enjoy our lives enjoy
[2:15:27.580 --> 2:15:36.300]  our families enjoy god's creation and really thank god for things just every second because that is
[2:15:36.300 --> 2:15:41.420]  what communion with god is all about is is is the worship of god and that just means the dialing
[2:15:41.420 --> 2:15:46.460]  in and the plugging into it and the appreciation of it and and just that that connection is the
[2:15:46.460 --> 2:15:50.380]  worship the worship isn't just getting on your knees it's the it's the connecting
[2:15:53.020 --> 2:15:58.300]  and you better humble yourself when you jack into that so let's go back to your phone calls here
[2:15:59.740 --> 2:16:02.940]  as we cover the incredible things unfolding on this planet
[2:16:06.940 --> 2:16:13.100]  let's talk to dj in new jersey dj in new jersey thanks for holding it on the air
[2:16:13.100 --> 2:16:20.940]  here in new york and i just wanted to share with you a tragic experience i'm going through
[2:16:20.940 --> 2:16:28.460]  with my family right now related to the vaccine and before i get into that i just want to thank
[2:16:28.460 --> 2:16:37.900]  you so much alex because i suffer with more gallons and i have been able to sustain myself
[2:16:37.900 --> 2:16:43.580]  because of all the nutrients that i get from you the farmers the nutraceuticals that i purchase
[2:16:43.580 --> 2:16:51.340]  regularly and i came into a knowledge of nanotech because of my suffering with this condition
[2:16:52.220 --> 2:16:57.820]  and it was very horrible in the beginning and you're uh the various ones i don't need to name
[2:16:57.820 --> 2:17:03.340]  them all but i'm on a lot of them right now they really make a difference for me so to get into my
[2:17:03.340 --> 2:17:13.500]  story i have an uncle who lives in new jersey he is uh he's pretty well known in the pharmaceutical
[2:17:13.500 --> 2:17:23.100]  realm he developed the primary medicine for parkinson's disease called eldopa and he also
[2:17:23.100 --> 2:17:28.060]  created three different classes of cardiac medicine he's a very accomplished scientist
[2:17:28.060 --> 2:17:33.340]  and uh his story i could go into another time if you wanted to hear that what the pharmaceutical
[2:17:33.340 --> 2:17:39.420]  industry did to him you would think he would never ever trust them again and he took the
[2:17:39.420 --> 2:17:47.340]  Pfizer shot and when he got the second shot he developed a horrible pneumonia now he's 98 years
[2:17:47.340 --> 2:17:54.780]  old was a vibrant healthy man for many years uh exercised a lot was driving around in his pickup
[2:17:54.780 --> 2:18:01.740]  truck until just recently that's how healthy and sturdy he's been okay so i spoke to him this morning
[2:18:01.740 --> 2:18:09.020]  to find out how he's doing he said not good i said well what's going on he said you know i feel
[2:18:09.020 --> 2:18:14.380]  worse and worse and i can't get any help from these doctors here i said well they're not going to
[2:18:14.380 --> 2:18:18.620]  really help you because some of them don't even really know what's going on with this they're not
[2:18:18.620 --> 2:18:26.140]  educated about it and so i started to teach him from the layperson that i am and what i've learned
[2:18:26.140 --> 2:18:32.220]  and studied about the uh you know the spike proteins and how they replicate just like other
[2:18:32.220 --> 2:18:38.220]  nanotechnology self replicates and then i told him it's going to block your ability of your immune
[2:18:38.220 --> 2:18:43.180]  system to fight anything that's it it's going to continue to replicate till it kills him that's
[2:18:43.180 --> 2:18:51.420]  right and i i i just want to run over there with some dna force with some uh you know i'm not a
[2:18:51.420 --> 2:18:56.460]  medical doctor and i've had some on and you know that's a big question what i mean we know
[2:18:57.340 --> 2:19:02.140]  we know vitamins and minerals to stop regular covid but once your body attacks itself with
[2:19:02.140 --> 2:19:08.220]  the spike protein um that's really a beyond an autoimmune response uh it's attacking you at the
[2:19:08.220 --> 2:19:13.660]  cellular level and we know it killed the rats that took it uh and so and we know it attacks
[2:19:13.660 --> 2:19:18.140]  their lungs that was the main way the rats died in the major university of texas study funded by
[2:19:18.140 --> 2:19:24.620]  falchi uh was it eight holes in their lungs uh and so let me ask this this this this doctor
[2:19:24.620 --> 2:19:28.460]  who's coming on i'm going to ask her uh because that's what she's coming on about is people dying
[2:19:28.460 --> 2:19:33.340]  from the vaccine toward the hospital or they're then saying they had covid but god bless you dj
[2:19:33.340 --> 2:19:39.980]  and i appreciate your call wow now there it is increasing number of post spars pneumonia cases
[2:19:39.980 --> 2:19:47.340]  reported across the country of those that had taken the vaccine that's in spars 25 28 so 26 is in
[2:19:47.340 --> 2:19:52.620]  2021 which is this year so they war game it all out in live time as general flinn said it's definitely
[2:19:52.620 --> 2:19:56.700]  a war game of what's currently happening they just said it in the future so they have a manual
[2:19:56.700 --> 2:20:00.700]  how to launch the attack but if they get caught they go oh this is just a drill this is just a
[2:20:00.700 --> 2:20:07.660]  scenario that's out of john hopkins uh let's go ahead take another call here is it ben is it jack
[2:20:07.660 --> 2:20:14.220]  who's with all the longest here is it adam uh taylor uh let's talk to taylor in florida on the
[2:20:14.220 --> 2:20:21.340]  same subject of a recent study on spike protein go ahead and tell us about taylor hey alex i hope
[2:20:21.340 --> 2:20:26.780]  you're doing well uh so recently i was doing some research online and i came across this study from
[2:20:26.780 --> 2:20:34.140]  the american heart association that from my understanding um found that the spike protein
[2:20:34.140 --> 2:20:41.020]  alone is enough to damage lung tissue i believe what they did was they isolated the spike protein
[2:20:41.020 --> 2:20:47.500]  and they introduced it to two different or they introduced it to one lung tissue left one alone
[2:20:47.500 --> 2:20:54.140]  lung tissue that was introduced to the spike protein became heavily damaged and you know
[2:20:54.140 --> 2:20:58.540]  diseased and and that's what happened with the mice and that's what happened in over 50
[2:20:58.540 --> 2:21:02.620]  studies we know but you just heard the guy whose uncle's dying with his lungs right now after the
[2:21:02.620 --> 2:21:11.100]  vaccine yeah yeah um and my concern is is that people are getting these these shots they're
[2:21:11.100 --> 2:21:15.100]  getting these jabs and if they're getting johnson and johnson they're just getting spike protein
[2:21:15.100 --> 2:21:20.380]  directly injected into their body if they're getting Pfizer or Moderna then their body is
[2:21:20.380 --> 2:21:25.740]  learning to produce spike protein and with all these people that are now going to have
[2:21:25.740 --> 2:21:31.980]  spike proteins introduced to their body how long is it until we see people develop lung diseases
[2:21:31.980 --> 2:21:37.740]  people not able to breathe people dying and why aren't our politicians people like ran paul head
[2:21:37.740 --> 2:21:43.740]  crews even ron stanzas great you know great politicians but even they encourage people
[2:21:43.740 --> 2:21:48.540]  to get the vaccine and they talk about it as if it's a good thing so what do we do how do we
[2:21:48.540 --> 2:21:52.700]  encourage them or show well that's because they wanted to get things reopened and they were told
[2:21:52.700 --> 2:21:58.220]  was just a regular get pause right there guys you found it right there were tv viewers and and they
[2:21:58.220 --> 2:22:01.900]  didn't understand all these studies and then now once they say take it they don't want to admit
[2:22:01.900 --> 2:22:08.460]  they were wrong but but there it is uh they did biopsies they did autopsies on the mice and rats
[2:22:09.100 --> 2:22:13.980]  after and they show the groups that were not given the the three vaccines they did three control
[2:22:13.980 --> 2:22:18.860]  groups they did three groups of rats that they gave the vaccine to three groups of rats they did
[2:22:18.860 --> 2:22:27.340]  three different vaccines uh all different types of uh covid coronavirus vaccines and you can see
[2:22:27.340 --> 2:22:32.940]  that again the mice that were given and had their lungs eaten into bloody pulps and then those that
[2:22:32.940 --> 2:22:37.660]  didn't had no problem in their lungs so uh exactly what you're talking about what's the name of the
[2:22:37.660 --> 2:22:43.340]  american heart association study you're talking about or so i can pull it up let me try to find it
[2:22:43.340 --> 2:22:51.340]  i had just searched it up on the call it is give me one second it's okay it is called SARS-CoV-2
[2:22:51.340 --> 2:22:59.180]  spike protein and pairs endothelial function via down regular of ACE2 yeah i think i've seen that
[2:22:59.180 --> 2:23:04.300]  when there's this over 50 i've seen say it again we're going to pull it up all right so one more
[2:23:04.300 --> 2:23:13.660]  time it is SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and pairs endothelial function via down regular down regulation
[2:23:13.660 --> 2:23:20.780]  excuse me of ACE2 wow all right thank you so much there it is SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and pairs
[2:23:20.780 --> 2:23:26.460]  endothelial function via down regulation of ACE2 nothing like getting your lungs eaten
[2:23:26.460 --> 2:23:32.620]  sorry for that fellas uncle all right god bless you sir yep and the mass death's going to begin
[2:23:32.620 --> 2:23:36.460]  and i figured by next winter they're going to claim there's a new bio weapon a new thing out
[2:23:36.460 --> 2:23:40.460]  that's doing it and of course it won't be that it'll be the vaccine that did it and so brace
[2:23:40.460 --> 2:23:43.580]  yourselves folks they're letting you think that oh everything's okay for a minute and they're
[2:23:43.580 --> 2:23:47.820]  going to sucker punch you again with everything they got warrior calls coming up and a special
[2:23:47.820 --> 2:23:55.340]  guest is popping in stay with us i'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and
[2:23:55.340 --> 2:24:02.620]  rattle off the successes info versus head if you're paying attention you know we've done together
[2:24:03.500 --> 2:24:10.300]  but i'll tell you this the technocrats are really upping their game and they are trying
[2:24:10.300 --> 2:24:16.140]  to destroy all independent forms of media they're trying to shudder and silence human resistance so
[2:24:16.700 --> 2:24:21.500]  now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate
[2:24:21.500 --> 2:24:25.740]  everything you warned your friends and family about us around to be true so it's now that your
[2:24:25.740 --> 2:24:32.380]  credibility is way up the power structure to silence those of us that they can't but it's up
[2:24:32.380 --> 2:24:39.980]  to all of us to not let them silence any of us we have the power but the sun is setting on humanity
[2:24:39.980 --> 2:24:45.820]  and setting on free speech we have to make sure that we fight hard right now to make sure that
[2:24:45.820 --> 2:24:55.500]  long dark night doesn't come so be the polar bears you are all of the experts agree that getting

[2:25:53.980 --> 2:25:58.380]  the globalist comprise the oldest and richest families on earth and they have brought down
[2:25:58.380 --> 2:26:04.060]  hundreds and hundreds of nations over the last thousand years they have bankrupted once successful
[2:26:04.060 --> 2:26:11.260]  countries all across the world and they've used the same formulas of civil unrest and civil war
[2:26:11.260 --> 2:26:16.940]  and they're doing it again to the united states of america and europe right now bringing in giant
[2:26:16.940 --> 2:26:21.820]  third world populations and then brainwashing them and turning them against the country that they
[2:26:21.820 --> 2:26:26.060]  wanted to emigrate to because they knew it was better and had more freedom and more opportunity
[2:26:26.060 --> 2:26:31.100]  ladies and gentlemen america is under scientific attack and it's time now more than ever to raise
[2:26:31.100 --> 2:26:36.140]  the alarm and warn everyone you know that what's really happening and at the same time get prepared
[2:26:36.140 --> 2:26:40.220]  in case things continue to go south like they are one of the smartest moves out there is to get high
[2:26:40.220 --> 2:26:45.340]  quality swarble food so that as inflation goes up it's a way to defeat the inflation and have
[2:26:45.340 --> 2:26:51.580]  insurance you can eat so we've extended the sale through this sunday at 10 off all swarble foods
[2:26:51.580 --> 2:26:57.660]  that prepare with alex.com i am a very humble person but i'm also a bold person and so as
[2:26:57.660 --> 2:27:01.500]  bad as things are with the globalist attacking humanity with all the terrible things that are
[2:27:01.500 --> 2:27:08.220]  unfolding i want you to know a lot of positive things are happening as well i'm a public figure so
[2:27:08.220 --> 2:27:12.540]  i get to see things zero public doesn't get to see and let me tell you whether it's police chiefs
[2:27:12.540 --> 2:27:19.900]  or members of congress or even folks in hollywood or or or mainstream media or industry people are
[2:27:19.900 --> 2:27:24.460]  really really awake in the establishment they don't want to go along with the globalists
[2:27:24.460 --> 2:27:30.780]  but they're scared they're looking for leadership well that's where m4 comes in you fund us you support
[2:27:30.780 --> 2:27:36.220]  m4store.com you get great products at the same time we will then go out and do what the globalist
[2:27:36.220 --> 2:27:41.980]  says unpopular but the globalist will target you for to show people that it's safe to tell the truth
[2:27:41.980 --> 2:27:48.620]  and to take the heat that's our job so please keep us on air so we can hit the barbed wire so we
[2:27:48.620 --> 2:27:58.060]  can meet the shock groups and the information war fund us at m4store.com you're listening to the alex
[2:27:58.060 --> 2:28:17.180]  jones show emergency folks dr jane ruby is here with us and it's very a synchronicity
[2:28:17.180 --> 2:28:23.500]  serendipity fortuitous we just had a caller bring up the very study she was coming on about
[2:28:23.500 --> 2:28:31.500]  SARS-CoV-2 spike protein impairs epithelial function via down regulation of ACE2 she'll
[2:28:31.500 --> 2:28:36.780]  put that in easy to understand jargon for myself and i guess a lot of other people
[2:28:36.780 --> 2:28:41.820]  dr jane ruby is a washington dc health economist and new right political pundit who hosts a
[2:28:41.820 --> 2:28:48.140]  weeknight show a sea of new media also is her book illustrates the emergence of a new generation
[2:28:48.140 --> 2:28:53.020]  of journalists and truth tellers dr jane ruby.com and she's been a guest she's guest housing she
[2:28:53.020 --> 2:28:58.140]  does just a wonderful job and uh she had me on this in a few weeks so she's got a lot of updates
[2:28:58.140 --> 2:29:03.500]  for us but this study thanks to you and others is really starting to get a lot of attention
[2:29:04.060 --> 2:29:11.100]  uh a breakdown why it's so important yeah it's great to be back alex and you know kudos to your
[2:29:11.100 --> 2:29:17.100]  audience that's a very sharp audience member to to be tracking this kind of study the reason this
[2:29:17.100 --> 2:29:25.420]  study is such a bombshell is because it explains the relationship now between these experimental
[2:29:25.420 --> 2:29:33.340]  injections and the rapidly surging occurrence of the dangerous thrombosis thrombocytopenia which
[2:29:33.340 --> 2:29:39.180]  is a sort of a simultaneous situation of blood clots and bleeding in the body and the culprit
[2:29:39.180 --> 2:29:46.060]  uh as as as this study now shows is the spike protein and and let me just review for for the
[2:29:46.060 --> 2:29:53.420]  audience uh we've talked before these injections are not they're not vaccines they do not stimulate
[2:29:53.420 --> 2:30:01.100]  your body to develop antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus uh and and so what they what they do is they
[2:30:01.100 --> 2:30:08.220]  actually force your body to utilize your own dna as material blueprint material to create the spike
[2:30:08.220 --> 2:30:13.980]  proteins you know those angry little red t things that are they're they're depicted around the the
[2:30:13.980 --> 2:30:19.740]  circular uh shell which everybody is calling the virus let me tell you what these researchers did
[2:30:19.740 --> 2:30:26.300]  that was brilliant uh they used mice uh knockout mice that are it's a term for mice that are actually
[2:30:26.300 --> 2:30:33.420]  prepared uh to to reflect human reaction what they did alex was they took an empty shell if you will
[2:30:33.420 --> 2:30:40.940]  molecularly and they just no virus inside no material and they just put these uh protein spikes
[2:30:41.500 --> 2:30:46.620]  around them and then they injected them into the mice uh and and watched what happened and they
[2:30:46.620 --> 2:30:52.780]  they saw the incidence of this uh these blood clots occurring it now we know why they're occurring
[2:30:52.780 --> 2:30:58.540]  all over the body we couldn't put it together it's the same process uh but it's occurring in the brain
[2:30:58.540 --> 2:31:04.780]  uh it occurs in a new placenta it occurs in the lungs it's it's causing all this damage
[2:31:05.500 --> 2:31:11.340]  and so now we have that connection we know that the body is being forced to make millions and
[2:31:11.340 --> 2:31:17.260]  millions of these spike proteins i've explained before on your show that there are amino acid
[2:31:17.260 --> 2:31:22.140]  components within these spike protein proteins that are recognizable in other parts of your body
[2:31:22.140 --> 2:31:29.420]  that are they're necessary and so those proteins are being attacked by your body uh so so they've
[2:31:29.420 --> 2:31:33.740]  actually shown that it's not the virus that it's actually these spike proteins that you're being
[2:31:33.740 --> 2:31:39.660]  forced to make with this experimental jab and and then those spike proteins are actually what's
[2:31:39.660 --> 2:31:45.260]  causing all of this these blood clots of this physician and by the way we also have a bunch
[2:31:45.260 --> 2:31:51.580]  of other studies we have the ut uh level four bio weapons research facility in galveston
[2:31:51.580 --> 2:31:58.620]  under a dr fouchy direct grant in 2012 with with mice found the exact same thing and they said do
[2:31:58.620 --> 2:32:04.780]  not develop a vaccine for humans perceived with extreme caution in the conclusion because it killed
[2:32:04.780 --> 2:32:11.260]  the mice and rats by eating holes in their lungs the same thing this other study shows so
[2:32:11.260 --> 2:32:15.820]  fouchy knew directly what he was paying for what he was doing i mean to me this shows this is
[2:32:15.820 --> 2:32:23.900]  premeditated i'll tell you from a scientific standpoint alex this looks like i just can't
[2:32:23.900 --> 2:32:31.260]  believe that all of this was created by coincidence or accident it looks like they intentionally
[2:32:31.260 --> 2:32:38.060]  well first of all by driving your body to make spike proteins not antibodies against the saras
[2:32:38.060 --> 2:32:45.020]  kov2 virus that was the first clue that something was intentional here because it's a deviation from
[2:32:45.020 --> 2:32:50.940]  the traditional approach in developing a vaccine this is why dr david martin who i had on your show
[2:32:50.940 --> 2:32:56.780]  last week and countless others like dr tenpenny all of these these doctors will tell you this is
[2:32:56.780 --> 2:33:03.420]  not a vaccine a vaccine resulting your body developing a surveillance system of antibodies
[2:33:03.420 --> 2:33:08.380]  not only recognized but then go out and kill and the former chief scientist at Pfizer over
[2:33:08.380 --> 2:33:13.580]  vaccines spent a huge letter with wolfgang woodworkers you know in december 1st saying this
[2:33:13.580 --> 2:33:18.780]  is going to attack these proteins in the placenta the heart the brain this looks like a depopulation
[2:33:18.780 --> 2:33:24.940]  weapon he said so that's the mainline top scientist that used to head Pfizer's science division so i
[2:33:24.940 --> 2:33:31.740]  mean this is purely premeditated this is so frightening alex it's incredibly frightening
[2:33:31.740 --> 2:33:37.180]  i keep telling people to wait people write to me all the time especially after being on your show
[2:33:37.820 --> 2:33:43.180]  and they asked me am i getting this transmitted to me from my spouse who got the shot are my
[2:33:43.180 --> 2:33:47.500]  children in danger if i already got the shot the reason i'm telling people to wait is this
[2:33:47.500 --> 2:33:53.420]  information is just coming in like this study that we're talking about uh just came out on
[2:33:53.420 --> 2:33:59.900]  april 30th because it takes a while for for peer-reviewed journals to to approve them they have to
[2:33:59.900 --> 2:34:04.860]  be vetted by other scientists who don't have a dog in the race this was published in the journal
[2:34:04.860 --> 2:34:12.140]  circulation which is a very high-ranking peer-reviewed journal in cardiopulmonary medicine so this is
[2:34:12.140 --> 2:34:15.580]  this is not why they skip the animal trials because they've already done them with similar
[2:34:15.580 --> 2:34:22.380]  vaccines and skip the human trials they sucker punched us yep yep it sure looks like they did
[2:34:22.380 --> 2:34:27.180]  alex uh i can't imagine what's going to come out next but i think the design of this study that
[2:34:27.180 --> 2:34:33.980]  we're looking at now uh it shows that when they went back and looked at the lung tissue and some
[2:34:33.980 --> 2:34:39.020]  of the brain tissue of these mice who were given these dummy viruses remember they were they called
[2:34:39.020 --> 2:34:44.300]  it a pseudovirus but it's really a dummy shell with the spike proteins around the outside of it
[2:34:44.300 --> 2:34:51.980]  it's the spike proteins that are actually causing damage to the lungs the brain the placental linings
[2:34:51.980 --> 2:34:59.580]  and in the way the process of that is by by attacking endothelial tissue in your blood vessels
[2:34:59.580 --> 2:35:05.740]  endothelial is just a big fancy word for cellular lining so your blood vessels are very smooth a
[2:35:05.740 --> 2:35:11.900]  healthy blood vessels very smooth shiny in the inside because blood travels at a very high velocity
[2:35:11.900 --> 2:35:17.900]  and it's very sensitive to any any blockages or any any damage to the the lining of your blood
[2:35:17.900 --> 2:35:22.940]  vessels these spike proteins actually damage they mechanically you can see it on the electron
[2:35:22.940 --> 2:35:29.100]  microscope they're damaging the inside lining of the blood vessels and when blood flies by blood
[2:35:29.100 --> 2:35:34.460]  components get caught platelets other types of platelets build up you get a plaque build up and
[2:35:34.460 --> 2:35:38.540]  you have a heart attack or stroke or you bleed out in the lungs if that fact you're saying I've
[2:35:38.540 --> 2:35:43.340]  seen a lot of these studies it's conclusive why is it attacking the lungs particularly is that
[2:35:43.340 --> 2:35:49.260]  because there's so many little blood vessels in there um it has to do with the ACE2 receptors
[2:35:49.260 --> 2:35:54.460]  that you see in the title of this study they're they're ubiquitous uh in the lung they're ubiquitous
[2:35:54.460 --> 2:35:59.980]  throughout the body but they're really prolific and I think that there's maybe an affinity uh
[2:35:59.980 --> 2:36:05.100]  originally they thought this was a respiratory illness and a lot of doctors including Dr. Michael
[2:36:05.100 --> 2:36:12.940]  Eden the former Pfizer VP of science uh believes that you know um that that it's really a then
[2:36:12.940 --> 2:36:18.540]  then they thought it was a blood clot disorder now they've got it down to this is really a vascular
[2:36:18.540 --> 2:36:25.340]  dysfunction but it all goes back now we know it goes back to these spike proteins and the virus
[2:36:25.340 --> 2:36:29.900]  itself has a toxic spike protein that can hurt the lungs and other things but then when you
[2:36:29.900 --> 2:36:35.260]  vaccinate for it it causes it 100 times worse which is what we're seeing is now most of the people
[2:36:35.260 --> 2:36:39.660]  in the hospitals already had the vaccine and they're just calling it COVID now and saying well
[2:36:39.660 --> 2:36:45.500]  you still got COVID despite the vaccine when really it's vaccine right and don't forget all
[2:36:45.500 --> 2:36:51.340]  four of these companies that are currently under the emergency use authorization result in the same
[2:36:51.340 --> 2:36:57.660]  thing excess spike production uh AstraZeneca and J&J go about it a little bit differently
[2:36:57.660 --> 2:37:03.500]  uh they use an adenovirus delivery system but but it's all the same that those let me ask this
[2:37:03.500 --> 2:37:08.540]  quick question from your research does anyone know this early yet which vaccine is the most dangerous
[2:37:10.220 --> 2:37:15.340]  I don't think we can say I'll tell you why because all four of them get to the same place
[2:37:15.340 --> 2:37:21.660]  which is to force your body to rapidly and over replicate these spike proteins now here's the
[2:37:21.660 --> 2:37:25.660]  dangerous part I'm going to leave you with people and we can talk about it another time
[2:37:25.660 --> 2:37:32.140]  people these these illnesses are going to come out uh sort of generally over the next few years
[2:37:32.140 --> 2:37:36.940]  and you must have been confused uh uh stew's going to be hosting the next hour so he's just
[2:37:36.940 --> 2:37:40.140]  popping in we're going to hand the ball off and we've got one more segment can you stay there
[2:37:41.100 --> 2:37:46.460]  fantastic doc okay wow this could not be more important we'll be back after this quick break
[2:37:46.460 --> 2:37:52.220]  dr jane ruby is here dr jane ruby.com and we've got uh the fellow I saw her on with coming up
[2:37:52.220 --> 2:37:56.700]  let's go to one in Connecticut you're on the air thanks for holding
[2:37:56.700 --> 2:38:00.780]  hello can you hear me I sure can sir thank you hey Alex before I start man I just
[2:38:00.780 --> 2:38:05.580]  I've been wanting to talk to you go and it's a pleasure to be talking right now here man
[2:38:05.580 --> 2:38:10.620]  sir it's an honor to talk to you brother I'm from New Brink Connecticut and I just want to plug in
[2:38:10.620 --> 2:38:16.380]  uh I'm a truck driver and two before us have changed the way I drive me and me and my my
[2:38:16.380 --> 2:38:22.940]  my brothers that drive a couple of us uh we're all Hispanics Cubans Puerto Ricans we used to be on
[2:38:23.660 --> 2:38:29.100]  monster and and Red Bull and Rola and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar
[2:38:29.100 --> 2:38:33.900]  and I just want to thank you for that man well brother we put more in this than any other long
[2:38:33.900 --> 2:38:38.540]  term high quality energy powder there is so this this was designed on one of the top guys in the
[2:38:38.540 --> 2:38:41.820]  country he didn't want his name on it because obviously the political issues but we had to pay
[2:38:41.820 --> 2:38:45.580]  a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it and we believe it is the best,
[2:38:45.580 --> 2:38:49.900]  strongest but healthiest energy out there and you're saying that it's made your life better so
[2:38:49.900 --> 2:38:55.980]  that means a lot to me thank you to all your truck drivers we love you your brain your heart your bones

[2:39:55.420 --> 2:39:59.180]  how did you predict over a year ago that food prices would explode within a year because it
[2:39:59.180 --> 2:40:03.660]  was in all the globalist actuaries that you shut down most of the world for a year it's going to
[2:40:03.660 --> 2:40:09.660]  cause a collapse in food production and distribution and not just that fuel and every other major

[2:42:13.580 --> 2:42:19.740]  all right alex jones here about the hand of a ton over to talk to host stu peters stu peters.tv
[2:42:19.740 --> 2:42:26.940]  they'll be hosting the fourth hour today ahead of elwin shroyer three to six p.m. with the war room
[2:42:26.940 --> 2:42:32.300]  and he covers a lot of really important topics but i i saw her latest interview up jane ruby
[2:42:32.300 --> 2:42:38.380]  on interview she did a few days ago with him on this other study there's so many of these prestigious
[2:42:38.380 --> 2:42:43.660]  studies coming out so dr jane ruby i was jumping in a lot there what other points you want to make
[2:42:43.660 --> 2:42:49.340]  about this and how do we warn people how do we tell them because i mean this is out of control this
[2:42:49.340 --> 2:42:55.980]  is conclusive they knew this and then uh i guess the nih cold of the vaccine makers this is how we
[2:42:55.980 --> 2:43:02.220]  want it we don't want the chinese what the indians did where they just have an attenuated virus and
[2:43:02.220 --> 2:43:08.460]  the body learns how to recognize that virus uh no they're doing this mrna and like you said with the
[2:43:08.460 --> 2:43:15.500]  aschra zenica uh and with the uh j and j it still does the same thing a virus vector system injecting
[2:43:15.500 --> 2:43:20.460]  it right in and making the body do the same thing uh so these are franken shots any way you measure it
[2:43:21.100 --> 2:43:26.940]  what's the bottom line here elix i'm afraid it it might be too late by the time people really
[2:43:26.940 --> 2:43:32.300]  understand this but the the main point that i wanted to leave people with on that last study
[2:43:32.300 --> 2:43:40.380]  that we we're starting to talk about is that the that by the time people start to react and and have
[2:43:40.380 --> 2:43:46.460]  serious injury and die from these bleeding blood clots uh that it's going to be it's going to be
[2:43:46.460 --> 2:43:50.700]  too late and the other thing that we're all worried about is that it's not going to be
[2:43:50.700 --> 2:43:56.700]  rightfully attributed to these these experimental injections they're going to start being called
[2:43:56.700 --> 2:44:02.860]  you know general cardiovascular you know uh illnesses and and it's not going to tie back
[2:44:02.860 --> 2:44:07.340]  to these injections but we're going to stay on it and we're going to try to keep you know keep
[2:44:07.340 --> 2:44:11.180]  that that information going so that people remember that even though these things are
[2:44:11.180 --> 2:44:17.020]  happening all over the body they are related to these injections well there's no doubt that
[2:44:17.020 --> 2:44:22.060]  they had operation lockstep and event 201 they pre-planned it all they've been caught spiking
[2:44:22.060 --> 2:44:28.380]  vaccines with with the sterilants before they've been caught uh giving people syphilis inside
[2:44:28.380 --> 2:44:33.340]  vaccines and they've been uh caught giving people polio and the vaccines even last year bill gates
[2:44:33.340 --> 2:44:39.740]  was that's Reuters the full horror of this though that immediately mass heart attacks immediately
[2:44:39.740 --> 2:44:44.700]  mass strokes immediately people's lungs being eaten into bloody pulps this is what they said
[2:44:44.700 --> 2:44:48.700]  they saw with covid but people that actually caught it because it's causing this this this your
[2:44:48.700 --> 2:44:53.180]  body to attack itself now you make your body create the spike protein to supposedly beat it
[2:44:53.180 --> 2:44:59.180]  and it's far worse that's what we're seeing everywhere uh let's go ahead and bring in stew
[2:44:59.180 --> 2:45:03.340]  peters who's gonna be hosting next hour i know on some other subjects they'll tell us about the moment
[2:45:03.340 --> 2:45:08.620]  but what is your view on this you know you've been a successful bounty hunter successful talk show
[2:45:08.620 --> 2:45:13.500]  hosts uh your family guy smart guy looking at this interviewing all the experts what do you
[2:45:13.500 --> 2:45:19.500]  think's going on there because only thing i see is premeditation 100 percent premeditation they
[2:45:19.500 --> 2:45:25.900]  absolutely knew and now they're giving you an ultimatum uh which is really interesting which
[2:45:25.900 --> 2:45:31.340]  we're going to get into next hour silence or death so in other words we're going to muzzle you and
[2:45:31.340 --> 2:45:34.940]  you're going to have to continue to wear these Fauci already indicated that these masks are going
[2:45:34.940 --> 2:45:39.820]  to be indefinite we know where these masks are manufactured on my program and yours alice we
[2:45:39.820 --> 2:45:45.980]  have shown people where these masks come from uh the the serious health implications long-term
[2:45:45.980 --> 2:45:51.900]  problems that it can cause negative health side effects of covering your face constantly this is
[2:45:51.900 --> 2:45:56.220]  i mean the and then the symbolic side of it the sharia side of it the muzzling side of it the
[2:45:56.220 --> 2:46:01.900]  distancing from you know your your peers uh kids at school doing this while they exert themselves
[2:46:01.900 --> 2:46:07.420]  people working out uh and so Fauci has already said that this is going to be something that he's
[2:46:07.420 --> 2:46:11.100]  going to do indefinitely you're going to be wearing these masks forever and now biden is saying or
[2:46:11.660 --> 2:46:16.300]  you can go take this injection well what did we have yesterday or was it this morning it just came
[2:46:16.300 --> 2:46:22.140]  out the yankees announced eight of their players who are fully injected uh are now testing positive
[2:46:22.140 --> 2:46:27.020]  for covet 19 well of course they are they told us from the beginning that you would have to continue
[2:46:27.020 --> 2:46:32.060]  to social distance continue wearing your mask stay away from people because this vaccine that's not a
[2:46:32.060 --> 2:46:36.540]  vaccine which then we started referring to as an experimental injection but for a lot of reasons
[2:46:36.540 --> 2:46:41.660]  today i'm going to stop calling it experimental because it's not an experiment this was absolutely
[2:46:41.660 --> 2:46:46.380]  methodically carefully designed premeditated calculated and that's the one thing that we have
[2:46:46.380 --> 2:46:51.660]  to give these these globalist credit for is that they thought about all of this and so the death
[2:46:51.660 --> 2:46:57.580]  sentence is intentionally designed to further that agenda by making these people hyper sensitive to
[2:46:57.580 --> 2:47:02.220]  any other virus that they might encounter after they inject themselves and the scariest part about
[2:47:02.220 --> 2:47:08.460]  this thing alex and dr ruby people are lining up tripping over themselves pushing each other
[2:47:08.460 --> 2:47:14.380]  getting in physical altercations to voluntarily subject themselves to this shot in the arm they're
[2:47:14.380 --> 2:47:19.820]  lining up this is so synonymous people ask very well said if people ask how they get away with it
[2:47:19.820 --> 2:47:24.860]  they've gotten the lawyers the doctors the nurses the media the system to sign on and now as the
[2:47:24.860 --> 2:47:30.940]  carnage unfolds 50 times 100 times worse than autism everyone will join in on the cover up now
[2:47:30.940 --> 2:47:34.940]  i mean i know people that have had family that dies they say well it's still worth it or women
[2:47:34.940 --> 2:47:40.700]  are paralyzed well i do it again i mean you talk about stock home syndrome stew and first dr
[2:47:40.700 --> 2:47:47.260]  jane ruby how do we get people out of this stock home syndrome alex it's really tough you know fear
[2:47:47.260 --> 2:47:52.860]  is an incredible motivator it's hard to shake people out of their fear i mean people write to me
[2:47:52.860 --> 2:47:58.060]  after having had the natural disease of covet asking me desperately where they can get ivermectin
[2:47:58.060 --> 2:48:05.100]  or hcq or if they're in in danger of being near someone who who hasn't had it the misinformation
[2:48:05.100 --> 2:48:11.980]  just really abounds you know if your theories are right if this and stews as well then what we
[2:48:11.980 --> 2:48:17.980]  may have been looking at in the sars one a vaccine attempt might have been a test run they after they
[2:48:17.980 --> 2:48:22.940]  knew the animals were going to die and they knew the illnesses and the blood clots and bleeding
[2:48:22.940 --> 2:48:27.420]  were going to occur they went full ahead think about it they went full ahead with the sars
[2:48:27.420 --> 2:48:32.540]  two program knowing full well that they at least got that part of their mechanism of action and
[2:48:32.540 --> 2:48:36.860]  that's exactly what that's exactly what stew just said that's so key what you just kept saying
[2:48:37.500 --> 2:48:41.260]  and that's how to complain for you we keep saying we're all guinea pigs we're guinea pigs we don't
[2:48:41.260 --> 2:48:47.580]  be guinea pigs no they did 20 years of study on all these stars and spars and covids and knew
[2:48:47.580 --> 2:48:53.260]  that it caused bleed outs in the animals knew it did this so that's why they skipped the animal
[2:48:53.260 --> 2:48:58.700]  trials that's why they went right to emergency authorization to do it out of the open so it
[2:48:58.700 --> 2:49:05.260]  could never be nailed down stew and that's why they don't want you to talk about things like
[2:49:05.260 --> 2:49:10.140]  htq that's why they don't want you to talk about ivermectin i got a prescription for ivermectin
[2:49:10.780 --> 2:49:15.180]  because i know a doctor this doctor prescribed it to me you know what it cost me it cost me
[2:49:15.180 --> 2:49:21.820]  10 bucks 10 to get a 90 day supply of ivermectin that along with vitamin d which you can take
[2:49:21.820 --> 2:49:28.700]  preemptively safely so you yeah that's right they don't want you to know about that because
[2:49:28.700 --> 2:49:33.900]  of obvious reasons i mean there's billions trillions of dollars in healthcare you want to
[2:49:33.900 --> 2:49:38.220]  talk about all of the things that could have been cured there's a reason why we don't cure
[2:49:38.220 --> 2:49:44.140]  cancer there's way too much money and power and control and manipulation leverage in continuing
[2:49:44.140 --> 2:49:51.020]  to allow these cancers to create fear fear drives compliance compliance creates control
[2:49:51.020 --> 2:49:56.300]  that is what all of this is is is a force of complete subservience to the state and they are
[2:49:56.300 --> 2:50:01.580]  winning because they're winning right now the information war which is why we have to continue
[2:50:01.580 --> 2:50:07.100]  to push back the question that you asked dr ruby is the trillion dollar question how do we make
[2:50:07.100 --> 2:50:13.420]  people aware of this in a situation in an environment where we are being constantly shadow
[2:50:13.420 --> 2:50:17.500]  band i was telling somebody earlier today i got a text from jan morgan she's running for senate
[2:50:17.500 --> 2:50:21.980]  in arkansas she's america first patriot she texts me at 12 40 this morning i didn't even know you
[2:50:21.980 --> 2:50:26.700]  were still doing your show you're never in my feed you are completely shadow band i mean it's
[2:50:26.700 --> 2:50:33.340]  insane that's right you can't count on uh people to to to be on the facebook or twitter feeds you've
[2:50:33.340 --> 2:50:38.460]  got to find the url you got to share the url to your email text message and word of mouth
[2:50:38.460 --> 2:50:41.340]  say hey they don't want you to see this you need to see it you need to share
[2:50:41.340 --> 2:50:50.540]  stu peters dot tv you need to share dr ruby site dr jane ruby dot com info wars dot com news wars
[2:50:50.540 --> 2:50:57.020]  dot com stu peters was hosting the fourth hour coming up at six after you'll hear him i'll be
[2:50:57.020 --> 2:51:02.220]  listening thank you stew thank you really appreciate the opportunity to be here and we
[2:51:02.220 --> 2:51:05.500]  appreciate you you're kicking ass i can't wait while i'm eating lunch somebody watching and
[2:51:05.500 --> 2:51:11.900]  listening dr ruby in closing what else you want to impart to folks for the minute left well there
[2:51:11.900 --> 2:51:18.780]  there's also uh these researchers also found out that the spike proteins proteins actually damage
[2:51:18.780 --> 2:51:23.820]  structures inside every one of your cells for those of you who remember high school biology
[2:51:23.820 --> 2:51:29.340]  there's the mitochondria we all used to know it as the the late term is the little powerhouse
[2:51:29.340 --> 2:51:35.820]  of the cell but the mitochondria are incredibly involved in your immunity especially with ace
[2:51:35.820 --> 2:51:40.780]  two receptors and without getting too technical these spike proteins are damaging they're literally
[2:51:40.780 --> 2:51:45.820]  fragmenting according to this study and they're which means they're literally blowing up your
[2:51:45.820 --> 2:51:50.460]  mitochondria in your cells a lot of people are complaining of profound fatigue for weeks
[2:51:50.460 --> 2:51:56.380]  this makes your body create trillions of little spikes bullets to shoot up yourselves
[2:51:56.380 --> 2:52:03.260]  yes and and to damage your body over time and when you start to have you know multiple different
[2:52:03.260 --> 2:52:09.660]  variable illnesses we just worry that people are not going to make the connection to the to the
[2:52:09.660 --> 2:52:15.980]  injections but but just like vitamins and minerals help with other viruses and we don't have any evidence
[2:52:15.980 --> 2:52:19.740]  we don't know yet whether that would help with the spike protein or or if we're getting it
[2:52:19.740 --> 2:52:24.220]  from shedding i mean i know fiser admits the shedding is real wow dr ruby thank you so much
[2:52:24.220 --> 2:52:29.260]  look forward to speaking in the near future my pleasure thank you all right folks i'm going to
[2:52:29.260 --> 2:52:32.460]  come back and do five minutes some stations don't carry that five minutes but some stations do so
[2:52:32.460 --> 2:52:37.020]  i'm going to finish up and i'm going to handle the time to the next guesthouse to peters and i'm
[2:52:37.020 --> 2:52:40.620]  going to hit a few final news pieces we'll be back in two minutes then he takes over
[2:52:42.940 --> 2:52:49.820]  globalist puppet joe biden wasted no time blaming russia with no evidence for the shutdown of the
[2:52:49.820 --> 2:52:55.500]  east coast gasoline pipeline that goes from houston right up through new york city supplies more than
[2:52:55.500 --> 2:53:00.940]  half of the gasoline of the east coast but who isn't that actually shut down the main pipeline
[2:53:00.940 --> 2:53:06.140]  from canada through the midwest to houston to refine the oil that's then turned into gas and
[2:53:06.140 --> 2:53:11.820]  simply east coast that's right joe biden shut down the keystone pipeline right after it was
[2:53:11.820 --> 2:53:17.660]  completed joe biden did that to america he has the history he has the background he's one that
[2:53:17.660 --> 2:53:22.940]  promised to quote get us off of fossil fuels he's the one that's trying to extend the lockdown
[2:53:22.940 --> 2:53:28.780]  of the country remember ladies and gentlemen that the new world order wants a post-industrial world
[2:53:28.780 --> 2:53:34.380]  and they want the united states europe and australia cripples so communist china can be dominant
[2:53:34.380 --> 2:53:39.660]  it's not russia that's the enemy it's communist china and their millions like joe biden in control
[2:53:39.660 --> 2:53:46.060]  the white house that's the facts that's the information cognitive dissonance is a major
[2:53:46.060 --> 2:53:52.300]  issue amongst the left it can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept if you
[2:53:52.300 --> 2:53:58.060]  have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition buy them a bottle of ultimate
[2:53:58.060 --> 2:54:03.980]  fish oil from info wars store dot com studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil
[2:54:03.980 --> 2:54:10.300]  supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure decrease triglyceride levels decrease the growth
[2:54:10.300 --> 2:54:16.140]  rate of plaque and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses and joints and the
[2:54:16.140 --> 2:54:23.580]  digestive system recent studies have suggested that high epa and dha fish oil can stimulate
[2:54:23.580 --> 2:54:30.700]  immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells it worked for my family
[2:54:30.700 --> 2:54:37.740]  and now i can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality get
[2:54:37.740 --> 2:54:43.500]  your ultimate fish oil for a friend family member or yourself at info wars store dot com
[2:54:46.780 --> 2:54:49.420]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:54:49.420 --> 2:54:51.420]  oh
[2:55:06.380 --> 2:55:11.260]  all right folks we're in the fourth hour in five minutes i will step down from this broadcasting
[2:55:11.260 --> 2:55:18.940]  seat and hand it over to stu peters for myself i have a 64 trillion dollar question
[2:55:19.660 --> 2:55:23.740]  and i know that this is the question you have as well because i heard callers asking it earlier
[2:55:23.740 --> 2:55:28.780]  and it's what i was already thinking we know that from regular viruses whether they're flu
[2:55:28.780 --> 2:55:34.700]  viruses cold viruses corona any of it that they can't replicate if you have it's almost impossible
[2:55:34.700 --> 2:55:39.980]  if you have enough vitamins and minerals of all the essential types that that means a magnesium
[2:55:39.980 --> 2:55:46.380]  that means zinc that means c that means d vitamin k that they can't replicate in yourselves and that
[2:55:46.380 --> 2:55:52.460]  that then protects the mitochondria but if it's just a straight up spike that's like a bullet a weapon
[2:55:53.660 --> 2:55:59.900]  and then your body also attacks that and causes an autoimmune response i i don't know what you do
[2:56:01.020 --> 2:56:05.020]  and obviously fizer and others admit the shedding it's in their own literature they
[2:56:05.020 --> 2:56:10.700]  have snopes saying it's not true because it's in the damn fizer admissions that we don't know
[2:56:10.700 --> 2:56:15.340]  pregnant women should have this we don't know the woman breastfeeding should have it and whether
[2:56:15.340 --> 2:56:22.460]  it'll shed or infect the child and now they're admitting it's happening and even even mpr in
[2:56:22.460 --> 2:56:28.700]  us today at science going you know six months ago we're worried the vaccine will cause new strains
[2:56:28.700 --> 2:56:34.620]  and and make the body create new viruses which it can do they're way more advanced than they've
[2:56:34.620 --> 2:56:38.940]  you know told the general public this is that they've been really obsessed with this for a while and
[2:56:38.940 --> 2:56:43.900]  this is a soft kill weapon and it just attacks different people different ways some people are
[2:56:43.900 --> 2:56:49.020]  going to live 20 years some are going to live six months uh and it's it's pretty clear it's it's it's
[2:56:49.020 --> 2:56:54.220]  shedding and so you've got a lot of camps for jews and christians saying we don't want people
[2:56:54.220 --> 2:56:58.220]  that have had the vaccine around our kids it's not vaccine turns your body into an engine of
[2:56:58.220 --> 2:57:02.860]  you know biological pollution you got the left trying to intimidate us to take it because they're
[2:57:02.860 --> 2:57:07.740]  married to the to satan in the state uh you you've got all these different schools and different
[2:57:08.460 --> 2:57:12.700]  whole food type places that aren't whole foods but other grocery stores saying don't come into
[2:57:12.700 --> 2:57:16.860]  your vaccinated and you know that's not bullying that's pushback because they're the ones trying
[2:57:16.860 --> 2:57:21.420]  to tell us we won't have a life till we submit to them how about things we own we just say you're
[2:57:21.420 --> 2:57:26.620]  not welcome so they start thinking about what's happening because the left runs on peer pressure
[2:57:26.620 --> 2:57:31.820]  they're followers they run the left hand path that they're basically satanist or they're useful
[2:57:31.820 --> 2:57:37.180]  idiots that buy into i'm the good guy the tv said so they're useful idiots and satanists that
[2:57:37.180 --> 2:57:41.660]  want to be powerful and satanists that are in power uh and that's really what it comes down to
[2:57:41.660 --> 2:57:46.940]  and it's extremely serious so you've got my commitment that i'm going to reach out to a bunch
[2:57:46.940 --> 2:57:52.380]  of scientists and a bunch of medical doctors and we're going to really twist uh sherry timpinney's
[2:57:52.380 --> 2:57:56.940]  arm too to get back on it's a really respect her but i know a lot of other epidemiologists
[2:57:56.940 --> 2:58:02.940]  and scientists people need to contact wolfgang wudarg dr yedon all of them and say is there any
[2:58:02.940 --> 2:58:08.860]  counter to what's it it's replicating to get it out of you or if you're around people to protect
[2:58:08.860 --> 2:58:15.020]  yourself or at least mitigate it i mean that's where we are uh you know they try to keep you from
[2:58:15.020 --> 2:58:18.620]  knowing about vitamins and minerals that are essential they're just essential as oxygen or
[2:58:18.620 --> 2:58:23.420]  water you just takes longer to die if you don't have them um and and that's that's like a hundred
[2:58:23.420 --> 2:58:27.260]  percent folks the problem is some people get so old their guts are messed up you can't absorb it
[2:58:27.260 --> 2:58:31.500]  then there's that issue or the cardiovascular so clogged up your body can't get the nutrients of
[2:58:31.500 --> 2:58:35.980]  the cells so but but but if you've got good cardiovascular and stuff are decent vitamins
[2:58:35.980 --> 2:58:40.620]  and minerals you're bulletproof but not with all of this from what i know i i mean i don't know i
[2:58:40.620 --> 2:58:44.860]  hope vitamins and minerals are the answer as lord knows i've been taking a lot more of them uh and
[2:58:44.860 --> 2:58:51.580]  i feel you'll feel more energy and a lot better um by the way with inflation coming up all the
[2:58:51.580 --> 2:58:58.540]  craziness we have locked in last year's prices of 10 lower in in 2021 but prices are going up
[2:58:58.540 --> 2:59:03.020]  everywhere in commodities and food to the highest levels ever recorded uh in the future's cost and
[2:59:03.020 --> 2:59:09.020]  even current numbers or record increases 6.8 or whatever it was for just last month uh versus
[2:59:09.020 --> 2:59:14.140]  the previous record of 5.8 i think it was but i covered that with the documents yesterday you
[2:59:14.140 --> 2:59:18.220]  need to get suitable food we've got it ready to ship you its high quality they're gonna have to go
[2:59:18.220 --> 2:59:21.740]  up on monday i twisted their arm again for a few more days a lot of folks wanted to get paid on

[2:59:25.580 --> 2:59:30.780]  insurance and to be able to lock in your dollar value now and then have this at last you know
[2:59:30.780 --> 2:59:33.980]  20-something years if you need it but i think you'll be eating it a lot quicker than that it's

[2:59:56.140 --> 3:00:01.580]  storeable foods and prepare with alex.com and i pointed out that the bloomberg global food index
[3:00:01.580 --> 3:00:06.540]  shows that current crop purchases being made for the end of the summer when the crops are completed
[3:00:06.540 --> 3:00:12.780]  around the world is up 76 percent that alone will cause civil unrest major problems since
[3:00:12.780 --> 3:00:17.580]  then inflation has exploded the last two weeks you've seen the pipeline crises you've seen governor
[3:00:17.580 --> 3:00:21.660]  whitmer shutting down or trying to shut down the pipeline in michigan this is a concerted operation

[3:01:00.140 --> 3:01:10.380]  i've been talking about how intentional this is the ultimatum that was given by joe biden
[3:01:11.020 --> 3:01:15.580]  making it clear to all americans that you'll obey or that you'll be silenced and the death sentence
[3:01:16.220 --> 3:01:22.780]  is intentionally designed in my opinion to further the globalist agenda for the depopulation that
[3:01:22.780 --> 3:01:27.820]  we keep talking about the control the compliance for the power none of this is by accident
[3:01:27.820 --> 3:01:34.060]  it's a very well thought out carefully manufactured methodically implemented plan
[3:01:34.780 --> 3:01:40.140]  that includes as alex was alluding to before the break it includes every asset at the disposal
[3:01:40.140 --> 3:01:46.540]  of the government including the influence that these elitists hold using money as leverage
[3:01:47.660 --> 3:01:54.700]  to coerce corporate america professional sports hollywood big tech print media major
[3:01:54.700 --> 3:02:01.900]  broadcast networks cable news outlets into constantly feeding the masses with really
[3:02:01.900 --> 3:02:07.180]  well written very appropriately constructed propaganda it's impossible to go anywhere
[3:02:08.140 --> 3:02:14.860]  without seeing signs encouraging or requiring masking constant reminders about how inconvenient
[3:02:14.860 --> 3:02:21.340]  life will be should you continue to resist what we used to refer to as an experimental injection
[3:02:21.340 --> 3:02:27.900]  and no longer do i believe it's an experiment it's also part of the plan the doubt that you
[3:02:27.900 --> 3:02:36.460]  and i have about the so-called vaccine that was anticipated and countermeasures have been put into
[3:02:36.460 --> 3:02:44.540]  place to combat any resistance that we might bring forth these people are evil but they are well
[3:02:44.540 --> 3:02:52.460]  organized they're the devil in human form but they're intelligent well connected deep rooted
[3:02:52.460 --> 3:02:58.780]  powerful people who have been able to manipulate the world into believing that the united states
[3:02:58.780 --> 3:03:04.780]  government is actually acting in the best interest of its people but has systematically
[3:03:04.780 --> 3:03:12.860]  been working to destroy us for decades people like george soros have been able to infiltrate
[3:03:12.860 --> 3:03:20.860]  every level of government they've influenced the criminal justice system they've politicized command
[3:03:20.860 --> 3:03:29.660]  staffs at law enforcement agencies they've funded the campaigns of radical progressive da's and other
[3:03:29.660 --> 3:03:36.060]  candidates ensuring that no opposition could stand in the way of a total takeover and the
[3:03:36.060 --> 3:03:42.540]  successful toppling of a political system that has governed and operated this republic for centuries
[3:03:44.700 --> 3:03:53.020]  you guys the state is so deep the depths of the swamp that donald j trump promised to drain
[3:03:54.780 --> 3:04:02.700]  was so carefully silenced under this this cone of silence that these authoritarians operate inside
[3:04:02.700 --> 3:04:08.940]  of influencing circuit district appellate supreme courts at the state and federal levels
[3:04:08.940 --> 3:04:17.100]  corrupting the judiciary so greatly that the entire system will always operate in the best
[3:04:17.100 --> 3:04:25.260]  interest of the elite the amount of time that it's taken to pull the curtains back and catch just a
[3:04:25.260 --> 3:04:31.180]  glimpse of what's really going on is only a fraction as compared to the centuries that it
[3:04:31.180 --> 3:04:37.260]  would take to expose every single player in the game that's responsible for this hostile takeover
[3:04:37.260 --> 3:04:41.580]  and destruction of liberty which is why we get so frustrated wondering why is hillary clinton
[3:04:41.580 --> 3:04:45.660]  still walking around why have there been no military tribunals why why is it okay for
[3:04:45.660 --> 3:04:53.100]  obama to spy on you know on trump as a campaigning person and even into his presidency they're
[3:04:53.100 --> 3:04:58.060]  looking for the total destruction and frustration of our of our liberty freedom is only an illusion
[3:04:58.060 --> 3:05:05.100]  at this point and there isn't a baby born today that will ever truly know what it means to be a
[3:05:05.100 --> 3:05:15.740]  free being imagine that the top paid bureaucrat in the united states government is not a person
[3:05:16.300 --> 3:05:23.180]  elected by we the people he's not somebody that was sent as a representative of our will
[3:05:23.180 --> 3:05:33.180]  but instead an installed personification of satan himself with unilateral authority to implement
[3:05:33.980 --> 3:05:43.020]  regulatory policy to completely transform infrastructure our educational system to
[3:05:43.020 --> 3:05:50.140]  collapse small business to restrict the movement of healthy people to terminate constitutional
[3:05:50.140 --> 3:05:58.140]  rights right in front of us in the name of a virus that he funded that was intentionally released
[3:05:59.900 --> 3:06:04.540]  and that he continues to lie about every single day anthony fauci is a criminal
[3:06:06.700 --> 3:06:12.300]  and this guy along with the help of the state that claims to operate in your best interest
[3:06:13.420 --> 3:06:19.340]  has been able to do all of it behind the cloak of a virus with a recovery rate of nearly 100
[3:06:19.340 --> 3:06:25.020]  percent let that sink in so now you have to ask yourself what's it going to look like
[3:06:26.140 --> 3:06:31.100]  when something really deadly impacts the globe something with real teeth
[3:06:33.340 --> 3:06:41.100]  some real effective bio weapon something designed to mutilate to spread like wildfire and kill
[3:06:41.100 --> 3:06:51.100]  something carefully fashioned for complete destruction something the masses will voluntarily
[3:06:51.100 --> 3:06:58.300]  run toward physically fight for and push to the front of the line begging to be injected with
[3:07:00.700 --> 3:07:07.020]  as we watch our favorite actors hall of fame players political icons people of influence
[3:07:07.020 --> 3:07:11.980]  and stature these people will advocate for your demise because they don't know any better
[3:07:14.620 --> 3:07:18.380]  a former president with a grassroots following
[3:07:20.060 --> 3:07:25.900]  will tout this lethal concoction and will probably take credit for its distribution
[3:07:27.420 --> 3:07:33.100]  because he's guarded by gatekeepers and he will never realize until it's too late the amount of
[3:07:33.100 --> 3:07:40.540]  blood that will soak his hands at which point i believe the plan will be that he will be targeted
[3:07:40.540 --> 3:07:46.940]  by the state he'll be taken into custody and he'll be tried before the military in front of the entire
[3:07:46.940 --> 3:07:54.460]  world to take a fall that's been designed in secret for many years none of it is coincidence
[3:07:54.460 --> 3:08:04.860]  nothing is by accident these masks trap germs and viruses blowing up the number of positive
[3:08:04.860 --> 3:08:15.100]  pcr tests which we have been told by its inventor are completely unreliable he called Anthony Fauci
[3:08:15.100 --> 3:08:20.460]  a liar in a fraud decades ago but nobody noticed nobody listened the explosion of these positive
[3:08:20.460 --> 3:08:29.260]  tests just magically leads now to the disappearance of influenza deadly heart conditions uh diabetic
[3:08:29.260 --> 3:08:35.180]  ketoacidosis strokes and all these other causes of death it's a miracle
[3:08:37.500 --> 3:08:44.140]  but meanwhile the injection ultimatum cannot be disregarded as stupid or unplanned it's not a
[3:08:44.140 --> 3:08:54.060]  geriatric moment by the installed fake president it's on purpose if dr ruby is right and if this
[3:08:54.060 --> 3:08:59.740]  study is right and if america's frontline doctors are right and if dr carry maday is right and if
[3:08:59.740 --> 3:09:03.580]  dr tenpenny is right and if dr mccullough and so many more the list goes on and on
[3:09:05.500 --> 3:09:12.940]  the the injection is going to make the injected person more susceptible to damage imminent great
[3:09:12.940 --> 3:09:19.020]  bodily harm or death when they come into contact with any other virus any other corona virus any
[3:09:19.020 --> 3:09:24.060]  other kind of sickness major damage to their organs catastrophic failure causing death they've
[3:09:24.060 --> 3:09:34.220]  been primed for death of course it's okay for you to take your mask off it's part of the plan
[3:09:35.900 --> 3:09:38.860]  this isn't some big news shocking announcement or revelation
[3:09:38.860 --> 3:09:45.420]  behavior obey you might get your fourth of july they were priming us for all of this
[3:09:47.500 --> 3:09:53.740]  of course it's okay for you to take your mask off inside and out after being fully vaccinated
[3:09:55.580 --> 3:09:58.860]  you got to get a hold of your neighbors you got to get a hold of your church congregation

[3:10:07.660 --> 3:10:13.260]  questions for her this is a big deal i mean i'm not a medical expert which is why we reach out to
[3:10:13.260 --> 3:10:17.180]  them but you have to stay informed and you have to make sure that you grab a hold of somebody and
[3:10:17.180 --> 3:10:24.460]  tell them this is not that you this is not the experiment you think it is you didn't research
[3:10:24.460 --> 3:10:30.140]  this because if you take this thing you are the research you're the laboratory animal that they
[3:10:30.140 --> 3:10:35.500]  skipped over when they rushed this thing through emergency use to the market knowing exactly what
[3:10:35.500 --> 3:10:40.780]  it was going to do to the masses we'll get dr ruby to come back and weigh in on all of that

[3:12:55.340 --> 3:13:00.780]  the first world collapses the third world dies we have such a complex civilization with so many
[3:13:00.780 --> 3:13:06.460]  billions of moving parts that when you shut down the first world it causes a chain reaction
[3:13:06.460 --> 3:13:11.180]  that will devastate the third world and really hurt the first world well now you're hearing
[3:13:11.180 --> 3:13:15.660]  about gas shortages all over the united states that's because the companies and the systems of
[3:13:15.660 --> 3:13:20.780]  the drivers that could barely get the job done before delivering gas had been shut down plus the
[3:13:20.780 --> 3:13:25.820]  keystone pipeline's been shut down along with other pipelines the left is now blowing up dams
[3:13:25.820 --> 3:13:31.180]  across the u.s. we're being shut down our coal power plants are off as well ladies and gentlemen
[3:13:31.180 --> 3:13:35.900]  prepare to be a total slave the third world is imploding as well the borders have been removed
[3:13:35.900 --> 3:13:41.020]  until you wake up this is a globalist chicom takeover great reset you have no hope they're
[3:13:41.020 --> 3:13:46.780]  announcing that there will be less than two-thirds the gas needed this summer so they told you that
[3:13:46.780 --> 3:13:52.940]  you're under lockdown one way or another and CNN laughed at you and your family so what's the most
[3:13:52.940 --> 3:13:57.980]  important part let's say in a bulldozer running over the globalist the treads the wheels the engine
[3:13:57.980 --> 3:14:02.780]  the scoop on the front it's all very important but the fuel is paramount and that's my allegor
[3:14:03.740 --> 3:14:09.340]  turbo force is vitamins minerals amino acids that synergistically work with six different natural
[3:14:09.340 --> 3:14:14.380]  forms of healthy clean energy that lasts for 10 hours in the average metabolic system metabolism
[3:14:14.380 --> 3:14:18.380]  of a human some people get 15 hours of something about eight hours but people take this people
[3:14:18.380 --> 3:14:23.580]  take in sports people cannot believe it's the best they've ever had because it's not high nobody puts
[3:14:23.580 --> 3:14:29.100]  as much product into their pre workouts their post workouts you can call us whatever you want it's
[3:14:29.100 --> 3:14:34.540]  it's a it's a total solution all around the best you're gonna find turbo force without you we don't
[3:14:34.540 --> 3:14:39.100]  roll with you we search forward together it's like a bulldozer without the diesel fuel if we
[3:14:39.100 --> 3:14:42.940]  don't have your financial support we will be defeated you support us to get products you already
[3:14:42.940 --> 3:14:48.620]  need to literally fuel your body your mind it's a win-win 360 together info or store.com or triple
[3:14:48.620 --> 3:15:12.860]  eight two five three three one three nine. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Of course it's
[3:15:12.860 --> 3:15:18.780]  okay to take your mask off inside and out after being fully vaccinated now OSHA really big news
[3:15:18.780 --> 3:15:24.780]  for us is saying if you require your employees to be vaccinated as a condition of employment
[3:15:25.740 --> 3:15:33.180]  i.e. for work related reasons then any adverse reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine will be work
[3:15:33.180 --> 3:15:41.420]  related that's a that's a tremendous first step by OSHA because we know about these adverse reactions
[3:15:41.420 --> 3:15:46.860]  we talked about VAERS data we broke that story on my show conveniently after i started talking
[3:15:46.860 --> 3:15:55.740]  about specific VAERS occurrences five month old baby 15 year old kid 16 17 year old kids conveniently
[3:15:55.740 --> 3:16:02.860]  the day that i brought attention to that on my platform the search function for the VAERS website
[3:16:02.860 --> 3:16:07.820]  went completely dark it went down it was disabled you could not get in there the site could not be
[3:16:07.820 --> 3:16:13.740]  found and then later that evening Tucker started talking about it on his program he kind of scratched
[3:16:13.740 --> 3:16:19.660]  the surface of this VAERS stuff and then when you go back now that it's up and you look for the
[3:16:19.660 --> 3:16:27.900]  specific VAERS cases that i highlighted on the show they are now gone so they continue to manipulate
[3:16:27.900 --> 3:16:33.020]  move around the information as we find it but it's there if you dig for it i can't do all the research
[3:16:33.020 --> 3:16:39.820]  for you you know alex does a good job his team they can't do all the doctor 10 penny dr ruby
[3:16:39.820 --> 3:16:44.620]  they can't do all of the research for you we're doing it and bringing it to you but you have to go
[3:16:44.620 --> 3:16:51.500]  and get into the urls get into the web talk to people who have had real experiences while we were
[3:16:51.500 --> 3:16:56.380]  in break right there i received an email from a listener whose sister has had now an adverse
[3:16:56.380 --> 3:17:00.380]  adverse reaction to the vaccine she wants to know if it's a coincidence well i'm not the medical
[3:17:00.380 --> 3:17:05.500]  expert but we do have the medical expert here dr dr ruby is nice enough to stay with us and hold over
[3:17:06.300 --> 3:17:10.780]  so these people have been primed for death which is basically what dr ruby alluded to
[3:17:10.780 --> 3:17:17.660]  when she was on my show last she's here again dr ruby osha has announced that any employees that
[3:17:17.660 --> 3:17:23.820]  you require to be vaccinated who have an adverse reaction that adverse reaction would then become
[3:17:23.820 --> 3:17:29.340]  work related so in other words these employers could potentially be held accountable my concern is
[3:17:29.340 --> 3:17:36.780]  whoever osha's counterpart is in the educational sphere for these colleges for these kids that
[3:17:36.780 --> 3:17:41.020]  are going back that are being required these young adults are being required to take this
[3:17:41.020 --> 3:17:45.020]  injection to take the jab to get the shot in the arm before they're allowed to return to in-person
[3:17:45.020 --> 3:17:50.620]  classes on their campus this is going to be absolutely catastrophic if the study that you
[3:17:50.620 --> 3:17:56.700]  brought to our attention that we broke to the world the other day is accurate which i don't see
[3:17:56.700 --> 3:18:02.220]  any way to really dispute the evidence i mean we saw the spike proteins we saw the graph
[3:18:02.220 --> 3:18:05.980]  we saw the study that you brought what's going to happen to our young adults
[3:18:08.940 --> 3:18:12.860]  so this is why we're trying to get the word out first of all the osha decision
[3:18:13.740 --> 3:18:20.780]  is actually good news because it puts the onus of responsibility and accountability for injury
[3:18:20.780 --> 3:18:27.260]  from these injections back on to the entity that's demanding it and and as you as you mentioned if we
[3:18:27.260 --> 3:18:34.460]  could get that same expectation for colleges and universities that are demanding it or any entity
[3:18:35.020 --> 3:18:41.500]  if we shift that burden you you'll see how fast those demands and those requirements are changing
[3:18:42.460 --> 3:18:48.620]  some employers are now realizing that if they're responsible then they're going to have to pay
[3:18:48.620 --> 3:18:55.500]  directly because the companies that they contract with for group insurance are already backing away
[3:18:55.500 --> 3:19:02.060]  and and they are saying we're not covering that for your group employees so that means it's going
[3:19:02.060 --> 3:19:07.740]  to fall back on to the corporation that's demanding that their employees as a condition of either new
[3:19:07.740 --> 3:19:13.980]  employment or continued employment get these injections so this is a good thing but i share
[3:19:13.980 --> 3:19:19.420]  your worry when i posted on twitter the other day was that in response large contractors have now said
[3:19:19.420 --> 3:19:23.500]  that they have changed or will change their vaccination policy to only recommend and not
[3:19:23.500 --> 3:19:29.020]  require so my question was and i i recognize this is a very good thing but my question was
[3:19:29.740 --> 3:19:34.140]  for these colleges for these universities the deans the people that oversee the faculty there
[3:19:34.140 --> 3:19:39.820]  who is the organizing body like the osha of of the the work environment who's the organizing body
[3:19:39.820 --> 3:19:44.220]  but what do you do you go to the government the people that are perpetuating this the people that
[3:19:44.220 --> 3:19:48.860]  are pushing this on to us what do you do go to the department of education i mean these are the
[3:19:48.860 --> 3:19:52.780]  people that are advocating for these students to do it making it impossible for them to go
[3:19:52.780 --> 3:19:57.740]  unvaccinated and return to class so they're essentially telling them you will never be
[3:19:57.740 --> 3:20:03.260]  successful at completing your degree completing your education all of your childhood dreams to
[3:20:03.260 --> 3:20:07.340]  become whatever it was that you wanted to become that you have now gone to study for you will not
[3:20:07.340 --> 3:20:13.340]  realize that you'll never get that success unless you roll the dice and take this shot in the arm
[3:20:13.340 --> 3:20:17.500]  that we are now seeing has been intentionally designed and released to cause catastrophic
[3:20:17.500 --> 3:20:23.580]  health conditions including death well the difference between the employers and the osha
[3:20:23.580 --> 3:20:33.260]  decision and the college college is demanding um vaccine or injection prior to coming back to school
[3:20:33.260 --> 3:20:39.500]  is that you know in the first case that that's your employment and um and and so there is a way
[3:20:39.500 --> 3:20:45.260]  to put that back that accountability back on the employer uh in the case of colleges and
[3:20:45.260 --> 3:20:51.340]  universities i want to point out to parents and students alike you have a choice of where you go
[3:20:51.340 --> 3:20:56.620]  to college or university and so yes i understand that you might already be admitted you might already
[3:20:56.620 --> 3:21:02.220]  be on your way to have you know completing your degree and and you've invested a lot in it but
[3:21:02.220 --> 3:21:09.420]  it's either your life or or your college degree most conveniently you know shortest route through
[3:21:09.420 --> 3:21:14.780]  this particular university we have a lot more power than we talk about lifelong events as well
[3:21:15.340 --> 3:21:20.300]  not just your degree i mean yeah you said this is your life but if you do survive
[3:21:21.820 --> 3:21:26.460]  infertility go ahead i'm sorry there's a little delay here i'm not trying to interrupt you
[3:21:26.460 --> 3:21:31.180]  yeah so sorry i know sometimes there is um what i'm what i'm saying is that parents and and and
[3:21:31.180 --> 3:21:37.260]  their children their teens or their their college age children are consumers where it's a little bit
[3:21:37.260 --> 3:21:42.460]  different in the employment setting so i'm happy to see that i would like to see the same responsibility
[3:21:42.460 --> 3:21:49.100]  shifted to any entity that demands uh in a in a bilateral relationship business relationship
[3:21:49.660 --> 3:21:55.580]  like colleges and universities that they take the accountability uh but but i want i want parents and
[3:21:55.580 --> 3:22:01.740]  students to remember you have choice and there are just like there are shops and businesses and gyms
[3:22:01.740 --> 3:22:09.500]  and salons that do not require vaccination injection whatever you want to call it uh or masks we bring
[3:22:09.500 --> 3:22:14.700]  our business there uh so we have a little more freedom in choosing where we go and you do have
[3:22:14.700 --> 3:22:19.980]  that freedom to choose uh which and leave leave your college and university it's not worth your life
[3:22:19.980 --> 3:22:27.100]  in your illness yeah we're seeing now uh i've got an email from a listener of the stupider show today
[3:22:27.100 --> 3:22:32.380]  i'm looking at it right now uh delta airlines has now sent out an email we learned this morning
[3:22:32.380 --> 3:22:37.340]  that their policy is going to be that for all new hires they will be required to be vaccinated
[3:22:37.340 --> 3:22:42.220]  you will not be considered for employment at delta airlines if you have not had the shot in the arm
[3:22:43.020 --> 3:22:47.900]  the article that i read this morning uh did not indicate what they were going to do with
[3:22:47.900 --> 3:22:54.700]  uh current employees of the airline but now i just got an email from an employee at delta airlines
[3:22:55.260 --> 3:23:01.180]  she she screenshot or he screenshot the email from delta airlines to all employees that said
[3:23:01.180 --> 3:23:05.100]  basically you're going to take this shot in the armor you're going to be fired i've got about 30
[3:23:05.100 --> 3:23:11.660]  seconds left here dr ruby any final words yeah you know in the wizard of us the good which said
[3:23:11.660 --> 3:23:16.940]  you have the power the whole time you have the power of all of these flight attendants
[3:23:16.940 --> 3:23:23.820]  particularly right now in deltas corporation band together and either left or went on strike
[3:23:23.820 --> 3:23:30.860]  whatever use their collective power to say no to delta and leave leave them with no no help
[3:23:31.420 --> 3:23:38.860]  uh it's again it's not worth your your life just wait hashtag just wait so if they did that i think

[3:28:37.020 --> 3:28:44.060]  everyone down distract away from everything that's going on this is the criminal activity that we
[3:28:44.060 --> 3:28:50.060]  have seen that that has actually been brought to light with no action whatsoever the criminal
[3:28:50.060 --> 3:28:56.700]  activity of the cabal of the deep state these these globalist puppeteers that are manipulating
[3:28:56.700 --> 3:29:03.020]  joe biden and canola harris all these people are so radical and so fake that we can see it every
[3:29:03.020 --> 3:29:07.740]  time that you turn on the mainstream media when you look at even outlets that were typically
[3:29:07.740 --> 3:29:14.860]  conservative outlets you now see you can it's very obvious that it's all fake the pundits are fake
[3:29:14.860 --> 3:29:21.740]  the the the witnesses are fake the experts are fake and these people are all manipulated by the
[3:29:21.740 --> 3:29:27.900]  likes of soros and the Rothschilds and the obamas who for all intents and purposes he's in his third
[3:29:27.900 --> 3:29:31.660]  term here he said that he was going to fundamentally change the country well that about that he was
[3:29:31.660 --> 3:29:38.220]  not lying and the crimes that have been committed that we know about are unfathomable and we're
[3:29:38.220 --> 3:29:46.620]  now just only scratching the surface of this exposure and the media meanwhile seems to have
[3:29:46.620 --> 3:29:53.580]  moved on past the violent insurrection and nobody wants to talk about it anymore but we haven't
[3:29:53.580 --> 3:30:00.220]  forgotten about it and paul gozar brought up a really great question the other day about where
[3:30:00.220 --> 3:30:05.660]  are these peaceful protesters where are these patriotic trump supporters now are they still
[3:30:05.660 --> 3:30:11.900]  being hunted down by joe biden's fbi are they still being charged with misdemeanor trespassing
[3:30:12.460 --> 3:30:20.860]  and then looking at three decades of imprisonment the illusion of freedom is is fake also right
[3:30:20.860 --> 3:30:27.020]  along with the media don't you dare talk about any of this intimidation don't you ever talk about
[3:30:27.020 --> 3:30:33.020]  any of this social pressure don't you ever talk about you know ashley babbit again because now
[3:30:33.020 --> 3:30:39.740]  you're just a crazy radical conspiracy theorist and you may be baker-acted or involuntarily
[3:30:39.740 --> 3:30:47.260]  committed or druged they'll throw away the key well my next guest is lauren witski she is the
[3:30:47.260 --> 3:30:54.540]  national spokesperson for the hold the line pack she is also not afraid at all we won't be silenced
[3:30:54.540 --> 3:30:59.260]  we still have questions about that day we want answers for the deep state and the media lies
[3:30:59.260 --> 3:31:04.700]  we want an immediate declassification of any intelligence surrounding what i would refer
[3:31:04.700 --> 3:31:08.860]  to as an execution of ashley babbit lauren thanks for being here to that you say what
[3:31:09.900 --> 3:31:16.140]  absolutely you know paul gozar congressman gozar has been the only elected official the only
[3:31:16.140 --> 3:31:22.540]  republican who has publicly even mentioned ashley babbit's name you know she was murdered in cold
[3:31:22.540 --> 3:31:28.620]  blood unarmed an ex-veteran you know she was a veteran she fought for our country and they hunted
[3:31:28.620 --> 3:31:35.180]  her down and murdered her with no warning no excuse and now we aren't even able to find out
[3:31:35.180 --> 3:31:41.500]  who the officer was that murdered her everything is conditioning they're trying to condition us
[3:31:41.500 --> 3:31:47.820]  into believing uh that we as americans trump supporting or conservative or christian americans
[3:31:47.820 --> 3:31:55.580]  our lives don't matter uh or they matter less than people like george floyd uh who got justice for
[3:31:55.580 --> 3:32:00.380]  what happened to him but people like ashley babbit are beneath people like george floyd they're
[3:32:00.380 --> 3:32:05.580]  they're trying to condition us and nobody is fighting for us except for paul gozar he was the
[3:32:05.580 --> 3:32:11.420]  first one who wrote a letter to the fbi yesterday i believe it was or two days ago um trying to find
[3:32:11.420 --> 3:32:17.500]  out why young americans who didn't even go into the capital building uh for the selfie insurrection
[3:32:18.220 --> 3:32:23.340]  are put on the no fly list people like me who didn't go in the building innocent law abiding
[3:32:23.340 --> 3:32:29.020]  protesters practicing our first amendment right um are put on the domestic terrorist wash list
[3:32:29.020 --> 3:32:35.900]  they're harassing and throwing trump supporters in prison solitary confinement still sitting there
[3:32:35.900 --> 3:32:41.580]  rotting in jail and nobody is exaggerating the truth either because i i specifically i can name
[3:32:41.580 --> 3:32:45.420]  a couple of names but one of them that sticks out in my mind is the political prisoner uh
[3:32:45.420 --> 3:32:50.140]  shan bradley whitesman he was a journalist he's a journalist from here in the minneapolis twin
[3:32:50.140 --> 3:32:55.820]  cities metropolitan area who went there he did nothing everything that he did there was documented
[3:32:55.820 --> 3:32:59.740]  either recorded or it was live on social media the guy was going to try to hide something it would
[3:32:59.740 --> 3:33:04.700]  be ridiculous uh to believe that he would record himself in some sort of criminal activity he was
[3:33:04.700 --> 3:33:11.260]  ushered into an open door uh much like the uh single mother of a ten-year-old who's now looking
[3:33:11.260 --> 3:33:16.780]  at been pregnant looking at uh 30 years in prison for being escorted by officers the thing was a
[3:33:16.780 --> 3:33:23.580]  setup loren yeah absolutely you know the gentleman that put his feet on nancy polosi's desk now he's
[3:33:23.580 --> 3:33:30.540]  facing 82 months in federal prison while we had rioters and looters burning federal buildings
[3:33:30.540 --> 3:33:36.140]  with federal officers inside in portland uh but like i said before it's all conditioning to condition
[3:33:36.140 --> 3:33:42.860]  us into believing that our lives are less value uh than the people who are on the left the people
[3:33:42.860 --> 3:33:49.900]  like george floyd people like blm antifa they know the fbi knows that there are cells of antifa
[3:33:49.900 --> 3:33:56.620]  terrorists who go and agitate um and set up trump supporters are set up conservatives uh to disrupt
[3:33:56.620 --> 3:34:02.940]  and bash these you know cause chaos in our events um you know they've known this this happened in
[3:34:02.940 --> 3:34:08.060]  charlottesville the same thing happened in charlottesville and a man named james field was hunted
[3:34:08.060 --> 3:34:14.380]  down he was chased down by a man with an ak-47 and now james field is serving life in prison for
[3:34:14.380 --> 3:34:18.780]  that see that was just conditioning back then everything they're doing is leading up to this
[3:34:18.780 --> 3:34:24.300]  point you know they're arresting uh pastors dragging them through the streets in canada and
[3:34:24.300 --> 3:34:28.380]  they're making sure that we see it here in the media because they're conditioning us because
[3:34:28.380 --> 3:34:33.180]  that's what's next they're going to come and they're going to drag us and through the streets and
[3:34:33.180 --> 3:34:38.380]  throw us all in prison just for our political beliefs and nobody in the republican party is standing
[3:34:38.380 --> 3:34:43.820]  up for us and shame on them in fact actually they joined in with the fox news narrative with the
[3:34:43.820 --> 3:34:49.340]  newsmax narrative that we're domestic terrorists and that this is an insurrection i couldn't even get
[3:34:49.340 --> 3:34:54.700]  out of dc after peacefully protesting outside of the capital building i couldn't even get out of
[3:34:54.700 --> 3:34:59.580]  dc before they're calling for me to be thrown in guantanamo day these people are shameful they're
[3:34:59.580 --> 3:35:05.420]  spineless and they're despicable but they are and you can do exactly what happened you saw exactly
[3:35:05.420 --> 3:35:10.700]  what occurred you had a firsthand account you knew that what was being reported in the media was a
[3:35:10.700 --> 3:35:18.860]  completely manufactured lie including using a heroic cop in their narrative to make us believe
[3:35:19.580 --> 3:35:27.100]  that trump supporting violent insurrectionist murderous cop killers wielding a fire extinguisher
[3:35:27.100 --> 3:35:34.380]  savagely beaten and cold blood until he was dead and now we know that to be a complete lie you tried
[3:35:34.380 --> 3:35:41.580]  to blow the whistle saying on newsmax that Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer incited that violence
[3:35:41.580 --> 3:35:47.020]  and that insurrection by ignoring the call for security and ushering these people in there
[3:35:47.020 --> 3:35:52.780]  and you got your segment cut you got your segment cut because that is not the narrative that fits
[3:35:52.780 --> 3:36:00.300]  that is not the narrative that works and this ashley babbit execution that was done in cold blood
[3:36:00.300 --> 3:36:06.140]  as part of the setup is the same cold blood that is now setting up everybody that was there
[3:36:06.140 --> 3:36:10.380]  whether you were at the ellipse or not whether you were inside of the building or not you could
[3:36:10.380 --> 3:36:15.420]  have been just in the dc area if you're a bank of america customer no doubt you've been approached
[3:36:15.420 --> 3:36:21.340]  by the fbi wondering why you were spending money there at that time there is no secret
[3:36:21.340 --> 3:36:26.220]  that you're right our tour pavlowski who was jailed the polish pastor who was jailed in canada
[3:36:26.220 --> 3:36:31.180]  you are absolutely right they are conditioning us for this that is an amazing revelation and
[3:36:31.180 --> 3:36:35.420]  we're going to keep you here because i want here's the question that i have for you lauren is and
[3:36:35.420 --> 3:36:38.780]  we're going to we only have a minute left so i'm going to get you on the flip side of the break here
[3:36:38.780 --> 3:36:44.620]  the question that i have for you is now what right because we see everything that's coming
[3:36:44.620 --> 3:36:49.180]  we see people like shawn bradley whitesman he's looking at i mean misdemeanor charges that are
[3:36:49.180 --> 3:36:56.140]  carrying 30 years in prison somebody told these cops to walk away somebody told these officers
[3:36:56.140 --> 3:37:00.860]  to turn their back when ashley babbitt was shot now i worked in the law enforcement
[3:37:01.580 --> 3:37:07.100]  a world for almost two decades for 18 years albeit as a bail enforcement agent a bail
[3:37:07.100 --> 3:37:10.540]  investigator a bounty hunter whatever you want to call it but i've been in a lot of scenes
[3:37:11.100 --> 3:37:15.740]  where critical incidents happened and so on and so forth when an officer fires a gun you better
[3:37:15.740 --> 3:37:21.980]  believe that every single asset in that department and probably neighboring cities are coming there
[3:37:21.980 --> 3:37:26.620]  they're responding to calls they're taking the pressure of a load of calls for service off of
[3:37:26.620 --> 3:37:30.620]  the department that was involved in the officer involved shooting they're there to help and give
[3:37:30.620 --> 3:37:36.860]  support wherever they can these people just calmly walked away from this and i'm not a tin foil
[3:37:36.860 --> 3:37:42.860]  hat wearing conspiracy theorist i'm the realist here we are the realists we are awake alex says if
[3:37:42.860 --> 3:37:46.380]  you're here you're part of the resistance we are part of the great awakening and more of it is coming
[3:37:46.380 --> 3:37:51.900]  up with lauren witski right after this on the alex joneshow at ban this dot tv in-game blueprint

[3:38:05.020 --> 3:38:10.300]  months ago that suddenly the limited supply we had an info wars store dot com had sold out
[3:38:10.300 --> 3:38:15.420]  that people were really talking about the doc's memory because major platforms like amazon had
[3:38:15.420 --> 3:38:21.020]  banned it because the globalists openly criticized the film like the new york times and so we printed
[3:38:21.020 --> 3:38:27.980]  20 000 copies now back in print and in less than two weeks we've already sold half of them this is

[3:42:00.780 --> 3:42:08.060]  so
[3:42:11.900 --> 3:42:19.020]  hey stu peters find me at stu peters dot tv also reminder here's a shameless plug for you the
[3:42:19.020 --> 3:42:23.180]  truth always lives at red voice media dot com make sure that you give us a check i really would
[3:42:23.180 --> 3:42:27.180]  appreciate it if you check us out come over and support us we're there tell them the truth all
[3:42:27.180 --> 3:42:31.100]  the time red voice media dot com and stu peters dot tv welcome back to the alex jones show
[3:42:31.980 --> 3:42:38.220]  she is a republican who by the way garnered more votes than any other republican in the history
[3:42:38.220 --> 3:42:42.940]  of her state as a first time run she's the national spokesperson for the whole the line pack she's
[3:42:42.940 --> 3:42:46.860]  an america first god-loving conservative she's unafraid and she joins us now her name is lauren
[3:42:46.860 --> 3:42:54.460]  witsky you can find her on gab at lauren witsky de as in delaware lauren the way to stop this
[3:42:54.460 --> 3:43:00.220]  i think is obvious and you can correct me if i'm wrong but getting loud seems to be really
[3:43:00.220 --> 3:43:06.380]  effective because if you look at what's happening in the world right now the smallest fraction of
[3:43:06.380 --> 3:43:11.900]  a percent of people with the loudest bullhorns seem to be the ones that are making the most
[3:43:11.900 --> 3:43:17.900]  difference when you talk about race vaders like abram kenby uh people that are employed by soros
[3:43:17.900 --> 3:43:23.500]  like black lives matter incorporated these antifa purple-headed crackpot basement dwelling video
[3:43:23.500 --> 3:43:29.900]  game players these people are just making a lot of noise they're burning things down they're trapping
[3:43:29.900 --> 3:43:35.340]  law enforcement officers inside of buildings and lighting them on fire they're throwing year
[3:43:35.340 --> 3:43:40.540]  and bombs at police officers they are ruining businesses they created an entire summer of
[3:43:40.540 --> 3:43:45.180]  carnage we don't have to rehash it everybody knows what happened last summer it's going to
[3:43:45.180 --> 3:43:51.580]  continue again riot season has only just begun it's only a matter of time before another officer
[3:43:51.580 --> 3:43:56.860]  is involved with a critical incident or any use of force situation and i know that you're not a
[3:43:56.860 --> 3:44:03.500]  law enforcement expert uh but there's to weigh in on this what is it that needs to be done are we
[3:44:03.500 --> 3:44:07.580]  looking at parents that are out in california right now specifically in one district that are
[3:44:07.580 --> 3:44:12.860]  standing up and saying we've had enough of this critical race theory i mean they're really uh
[3:44:12.860 --> 3:44:18.700]  holding these people's feet to the fire right now saying no we're not but i don't want my kids
[3:44:18.700 --> 3:44:24.380]  being taught like this i don't want them reading from these books in school uh i don't want them
[3:44:24.380 --> 3:44:28.940]  being taught that they are a lesser of a person because they're white and they will never apologize
[3:44:28.940 --> 3:44:34.540]  for this is that what we need to do just take a hard stand right now and just no we're not doing it
[3:44:35.340 --> 3:44:40.940]  yes absolutely you know we have got to stop the conditioning we have to shut down and completely
[3:44:40.940 --> 3:44:46.220]  reject their narrative that we are not allowed to have a voice that we deserve to be silenced
[3:44:46.220 --> 3:44:51.900]  or that we deserve to be murdered uh just because we're conservative or supported donald trump
[3:44:51.900 --> 3:44:57.740]  you know what we saw with the school board uh the parents literally drove out uh the school
[3:44:57.740 --> 3:45:03.340]  board uh who was trying to push critical race theory and they were um doing the mass mandates
[3:45:03.340 --> 3:45:07.340]  and people the parents took their rights back and they did it legally people need to understand
[3:45:07.340 --> 3:45:13.500]  as a conservative though biden's doj is weaponized against you so if you do break the law they will
[3:45:13.500 --> 3:45:17.660]  take it to the fullest extent and prosecute prosecute you to the fullest extent of the
[3:45:17.660 --> 3:45:23.420]  law so we have to be extra careful to make sure that we protect ourselves um but you can make
[3:45:23.420 --> 3:45:29.420]  your voice heard yeah how can you be careful yet effective at the same time because if we're not
[3:45:29.420 --> 3:45:34.060]  allowed to be loud you know if we're not allowed to burn heads in the street and hold i mean we
[3:45:34.060 --> 3:45:39.580]  remember uh holding the the bleeding head of the president in the air i mean these these types of
[3:45:39.580 --> 3:45:48.620]  things these little radical progressive terrorists they get a pass but godfearing christian anglo-saxon
[3:45:48.620 --> 3:45:56.700]  white patriot america freedom loving liberty embracing red white and blue uh blue working
[3:45:56.700 --> 3:46:02.620]  blue collar workers we get the shaft we get incarcerated viciously hunted down for taking
[3:46:02.620 --> 3:46:10.380]  a selfie at the capital and looking at 30 years of imprisonment so really what i mean what what
[3:46:10.380 --> 3:46:17.340]  avenues do we have to take action well you can get loud um you can build networks with your people
[3:46:17.340 --> 3:46:22.540]  and your friends um but also you can hold your elected officials accountable uh you know we have
[3:46:22.540 --> 3:46:28.540]  been putting pressure on the republican party to stand up for the january six protesters and you
[3:46:28.540 --> 3:46:34.460]  know what paul gozar was a champion for us he came through for us he is the one who asked who killed
[3:46:34.460 --> 3:46:39.020]  ashley babbit he was the first election elected official to do that we should demand that from
[3:46:39.020 --> 3:46:45.340]  all of our republican elected officials and condemn them for joining in with fox news is newsmax's
[3:46:45.340 --> 3:46:50.380]  narrative that it was an insurrection completely and utterly throwing us all under the bus and
[3:46:50.380 --> 3:46:57.340]  condemning us to the mercy of biden's weaponized doj is what they did um by listening and participating
[3:46:57.340 --> 3:47:02.940]  in that narrative that the left created um you know they know that there are antifa cells everywhere
[3:47:02.940 --> 3:47:08.620]  they know that there are domestic tear the real domestic terrorists aren't white christians however
[3:47:08.620 --> 3:47:13.180]  they hate us and they want us dead they want us thrown in prison they want to destroy our lives
[3:47:13.180 --> 3:47:17.820]  so they're weaponizing and organizing every outlet they can now that they're in power
[3:47:17.820 --> 3:47:23.020]  to take it out against us so we have to be vocal we have to be loud we have to combat their narrative
[3:47:23.020 --> 3:47:28.060]  we have to completely reject it and not only that we have to mock it you know we have to mock these
[3:47:28.060 --> 3:47:34.060]  people and make them feel stupid because you know what a granny selfie insurrection quote on quote
[3:47:34.060 --> 3:47:41.020]  you know that is paled in comparison to the the rioting looting mob in the 2020 summer that we
[3:47:41.020 --> 3:47:46.700]  had that was pure hell because we catered and allowed black lives matter to burn our country
[3:47:46.700 --> 3:47:50.860]  to the garrick ground where republicans most of them didn't say anything people like dan
[3:47:50.860 --> 3:47:55.740]  crimson will actually do the mob and put down her historical monuments that's great that it was
[3:47:55.740 --> 3:48:01.340]  executed she was executed in cold blood he was no and nobody's saying a thing about it can you
[3:48:01.340 --> 3:48:08.300]  imagine if that same situation would have happened on the streets of baltimore uh where you know the
[3:48:08.300 --> 3:48:12.860]  person that was shot would have been a black person and the cop would have been a white person can
[3:48:12.860 --> 3:48:17.740]  you imagine if that would have happened in chicago and then the entire police force just walks away
[3:48:17.740 --> 3:48:22.300]  they just walk away like nothing ever happened is what happened inside of the capital building
[3:48:22.300 --> 3:48:28.060]  the capital of the united states of america a woman was gunned down by a law enforcement
[3:48:28.060 --> 3:48:34.540]  officer and nobody is saying a peep nobody is demanding justice for ashley babbit whatsoever
[3:48:34.540 --> 3:48:41.900]  it is an absolute travesty and i cannot believe the silence the deafening silence that this media
[3:48:41.900 --> 3:48:46.620]  is just they're completely shut down on this narrative i mean there's all of these theories
[3:48:46.620 --> 3:48:51.500]  about ashley babbit not being dead and all this other stuff listen the woman was shot and killed
[3:48:51.500 --> 3:49:00.460]  by a cop nobody is saying a thing yeah and people were too afraid to even ask who killed her you
[3:49:00.460 --> 3:49:06.220]  know because they had conditioned us into believing that we were domestic terrorists when we were just
[3:49:06.220 --> 3:49:11.820]  peaceful protesters you know that is what was all over the news even news outlets that were supposedly
[3:49:11.820 --> 3:49:17.660]  on our side like fox news or pen Shapiro even megah mccain was saying that i needed to be thrown
[3:49:17.660 --> 3:49:23.820]  in guantanamo bay just for attending a peaceful protest sponsored by my president um you know so
[3:49:23.820 --> 3:49:29.580]  there there are certainly forces at work that hate us just as much as the democrats do even on our
[3:49:29.580 --> 3:49:34.700]  side so we need to identify and weed these people out um but we have to take back our narrative we
[3:49:34.700 --> 3:49:40.860]  have got to combat it and we have got to not allow this to happen because it is all conditioning
[3:49:40.860 --> 3:49:45.340]  and it is built up to this point and now it's becoming acceptable to throw a trump supporter
[3:49:45.340 --> 3:49:51.260]  in prison for life just because they're conservative or maybe you have an outspoken opinion about
[3:49:51.260 --> 3:49:56.220]  something that the left doesn't like the demonic left it's also spiritual too it really is a spiritual
[3:49:56.220 --> 3:50:01.980]  battle you know with christians christians right now we are literally fighting evil we are literally
[3:50:01.980 --> 3:50:06.860]  combating evil but we have to speak it into life we have got to stay loud we've got to stay vocal
[3:50:06.860 --> 3:50:12.220]  and we have got to stay involved um you know taking back your local legislator is very important
[3:50:12.220 --> 3:50:18.540]  as well getting involved locally in your party um replacing these rhino losers who are too
[3:50:18.540 --> 3:50:24.620]  fine right to speak out i mean even your local pta all the stuff that you never really pay attention
[3:50:24.620 --> 3:50:28.380]  to at the ballot box you need to do it she said demonic she was banned for it on twitter because
