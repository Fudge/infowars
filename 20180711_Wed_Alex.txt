[00:00.000 --> 00:16.680]  Waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones
[00:31.000 --> 00:37.800]  Well Trump continues to deliver on his promise to expose the tyrannical
[00:37.800 --> 00:43.880]  authoritarian EU to show how it's the new Soviet Union and all of its
[00:43.880 --> 00:49.320]  activities and to expose how Germany more and more is the lapdog of Russian
[00:49.320 --> 00:55.920]  energy getting 70% of its natural gas that its main energy source for heating
[00:55.920 --> 01:02.800]  cooling homes comes from Russia. Trump also is exposing the fact that we are the
[01:02.800 --> 01:08.960]  largest contributor to NATO and that NATO is involved in a lot of anti-American
[01:08.960 --> 01:12.840]  activities a lot of globalist activities a lot of attempts to destabilize the
[01:12.840 --> 01:18.200]  region and to bring in Islamists as well so it's quite a time to be alive to
[01:18.200 --> 01:25.840]  witness President Trump in their face. Here's a compilation that's up on
[01:25.840 --> 01:31.080]  infowars.com and newswars.com a two and a half minute clip from a full eight
[01:31.080 --> 01:34.200]  minutes statement by the president we're gonna be playing all of this today but
[01:34.200 --> 01:38.840]  here's two minutes of Trump saying it's very very sad when Germany makes a
[01:38.840 --> 01:44.120]  massive oil and gas deal with Russia Germany is totally controlled by Russia
[01:44.120 --> 01:51.520]  is very sad when Germany makes a massive oil and gas deal with Russia where
[01:51.520 --> 01:55.400]  you're supposed to be guarding against Russia and Germany goes out and pays
[01:55.400 --> 02:00.520]  billions and billions of dollars a year to Russia so we're protecting Germany
[02:00.520 --> 02:04.640]  we're protecting France we're protecting all of these countries and then
[02:04.640 --> 02:09.160]  numerous of the countries go out and make a pipeline deal with Russia where
[02:09.160 --> 02:14.480]  they're paying billions of dollars into the coffers of Russia so we're supposed
[02:14.480 --> 02:18.040]  to protect you against Russia but they're paying billions of dollars to
[02:18.040 --> 02:21.640]  Russia and I think that's very inappropriate and the former chancellor
[02:21.640 --> 02:26.440]  of Germany is the head of the pipeline company that's applying the gas
[02:26.440 --> 02:34.240]  ultimately Germany will have almost 70% of their country controlled by Russia
[02:34.240 --> 02:38.480]  with natural gas so you tell me is that appropriate I mean we're like we're
[02:38.480 --> 02:42.320]  complaining about this from the time I got in it should have never been allowed
[02:42.320 --> 02:46.920]  to have happened but Germany is totally controlled by Russia because they will
[02:46.920 --> 02:53.080]  getting from 60 to 70% of their energy from Russia and a new pipeline and you
[02:53.080 --> 02:56.480]  tell me if that's appropriate because I think it's not and I think it's a very
[02:56.480 --> 03:00.880]  bad thing for NATO and I don't think it should have happened and I think we have
[03:00.880 --> 03:04.840]  to talk to Germany about it on top of that Germany is just paying a little bit
[03:04.840 --> 03:11.200]  over 1% whereas the United States in actual numbers is paying 4.2% of a much
[03:11.200 --> 03:15.720]  larger GDP so I think that's inappropriate also you know we're
[03:15.720 --> 03:19.920]  protecting Germany we're protecting France we're protecting everybody and
[03:19.920 --> 03:23.520]  yet we're paying a lot of money to protect now this has been going on for
[03:23.520 --> 03:27.720]  decades this has been brought up by other presidents but other presidents never
[03:27.720 --> 03:31.360]  did anything about it because I don't think they understood it or they just
[03:31.360 --> 03:35.160]  didn't want to get involved but I have to bring it up because I think it's very
[03:35.160 --> 03:39.720]  unfair to our country it's very unfair to our taxpayer and I think that these
[03:39.720 --> 03:42.960]  countries have to step it up not over a 10-year period have to step it up
[03:42.960 --> 03:47.320]  immediately Germany is a rich country they talk about they can increase it in
[03:47.320 --> 03:55.120]  tiny bit by 23 well they could increase it immediately tomorrow and have no
[03:55.120 --> 03:59.280]  problem I don't think it's fair to the United States so we're gonna have to do
[03:59.280 --> 04:02.360]  something because we're not gonna put up with it we can't put up with it and
[04:02.360 --> 04:08.440]  it's inappropriate Trump is representing America like he's for the
[04:08.440 --> 04:13.680]  United States and these countries are incredibly rich they're incredibly
[04:13.680 --> 04:20.400]  authoritarian and people like Junker who's unelected and heads up the EU
[04:20.400 --> 04:26.720]  basically owns Luxembourg his family was the richest Nazi family in Germany they
[04:26.720 --> 04:32.320]  made around half the money off the war and got to keep all of it now we're
[04:32.320 --> 04:36.480]  gonna go to break here and we come back we're gonna air more of the historic
[04:36.480 --> 04:40.120]  things he's saying and get into so much more as the Democrats try to break our

[06:23.440 --> 06:32.920]  heart of FEMA region 6 Austin, Texas transmitting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[06:37.840 --> 06:43.280]  broadcasting worldwide on this historic
[06:43.280 --> 06:54.680]  Wednesday transmission I am sitting here watching the Democrats assault our
[06:54.680 --> 07:01.400]  border every two-bit socialist globalist corporate minion from de Blasio
[07:01.400 --> 07:09.720]  to Chucky Schumer you name it is going down to the Texas border and demanding
[07:09.720 --> 07:13.840]  that that there be no fence and demanding that we be wide open and that no
[07:13.840 --> 07:17.640]  one be tested for diseases and that no one be checked that they're not
[07:17.640 --> 07:24.240]  criminals it's it's incredible and I've got MSNBC video coming up quote
[07:24.240 --> 07:36.880]  Trump has evil desire against illegal immigrants evil desire and they show
[07:36.880 --> 07:40.800]  more video and photos of people in detention centers from the Obama era
[07:40.800 --> 07:45.720]  they've been upgraded but doesn't matter these are shelters and they've got
[07:45.720 --> 07:49.160]  federal judges sitting there you know ordering well you better find their
[07:49.160 --> 07:53.280]  parents you better release all the children even though many cases they
[07:53.280 --> 07:57.920]  don't know who their parents are people come here from collapsing third world
[07:57.920 --> 08:03.160]  countries and then it's all up to us to just let them in and then you've got
[08:03.160 --> 08:07.440]  people that climb up on the Statue of Liberty and grandstand and say give me
[08:07.440 --> 08:12.160]  you're tired you're poor you're hungry that's a plaque that was added to it
[08:12.160 --> 08:18.240]  it's a musta Masonic statue there's nothing to do with that and Ellis Island
[08:18.240 --> 08:23.760]  would hold people for a month to six months in quarantine by themselves to
[08:23.760 --> 08:29.760]  make sure they didn't have diseases so they always point at the Statue of
[08:29.760 --> 08:34.640]  Liberty and say that means our country is wide open well it's been one of the
[08:34.640 --> 08:41.000]  most open countries in history but you've got to check basic things
[08:44.320 --> 08:52.560]  Trump has fulfilled what he said he would do again NATO the EU all of it is
[08:52.560 --> 08:57.760]  designed to have the taxpayers of nation-states pay for it and then it's
[08:57.760 --> 09:03.040]  there to basically give diplomatic immunity and tax exemption to the
[09:03.040 --> 09:07.240]  Fortune 100 corporations and Trump is going in there whether it's the
[09:07.240 --> 09:11.160]  Trans-Pacific Partnership or whether it's NAFTA and GATT he's killing it
[09:11.160 --> 09:17.120]  he's pulling out of it and he's saying we're not gonna contribute half the money
[09:17.120 --> 09:23.560]  to NATO we're not gonna contribute half the money to the UN and we're not gonna
[09:23.560 --> 09:30.520]  have the UN Human Rights Board set up a decade ago shared by Saudi Arabia and
[09:30.520 --> 09:35.320]  communist China who are the most of you abusive countries you could imagine
[09:35.320 --> 09:39.680]  other than maybe North Korea but certainly the scales are much larger
[09:39.680 --> 09:44.880]  because they're more populated we're not gonna do it anymore again 280% tariff on
[09:44.880 --> 09:50.680]  all of our dairy going into Canada we have a 0% tariff how is that fair it's
[09:50.680 --> 09:56.280]  not we're being raped so coming up I'm gonna air a powerful eight minutes of
[09:56.280 --> 10:03.240]  the president speaking to the heads of NATO to Merkel and others are just
[10:03.240 --> 10:07.360]  throwing down the gauntlet and saying him by the way you've been running your
[10:07.360 --> 10:10.800]  mouth over here at NATO that I'm pro Russia when we've increased our troops
[10:10.800 --> 10:16.320]  on the border with Poland and Ukraine and done all this and when I've done
[10:16.320 --> 10:21.280]  energy deals the US globally they've already cut back Russia's market something
[10:21.280 --> 10:28.600]  like 30% in natural gas and oil and you get 70% of your natural gas and oil
[10:28.600 --> 10:37.960]  Germany from Russia in a sweetheart deal you're controlled by Russia because it
[10:37.960 --> 10:42.520]  is the EU bureaucrats it is Merkel that jumps on board with the Russian
[10:42.520 --> 10:46.360]  narrative and says if you're a nationalist in Germany nationalist in Greece
[10:46.360 --> 10:52.240]  nationalist in Spain or France lapins a Russian agent Trump's a Russian agent I'm
[10:52.240 --> 11:03.280]  a Russian agent meanwhile Trump has been very aggressively economically putting
[11:03.280 --> 11:08.080]  sanctions on Russia that I think are unfounded but also economically cutting
[11:08.080 --> 11:12.080]  better deals that do help the American consumer and American corporations and
[11:12.080 --> 11:18.920]  companies so the claim that he is soft on Russia is just asinine no one has been
[11:18.920 --> 11:24.800]  tougher on Russia since the days of Ronald Reagan that's a fact but this
[11:24.800 --> 11:29.240]  litmus test that everybody's got to be mean to Russia or there's somehow a
[11:29.240 --> 11:33.480]  Russian agent just stupid and you watch you'll be meeting with Putin coming up
[11:33.480 --> 11:38.320]  now here in a few days to be in Europe nine days he's been meeting with Putin
[11:38.320 --> 11:42.600]  and you watch you'll see a deal come out of that because Russia has got three
[11:42.600 --> 11:48.840]  times the geography of the US it's got more minerals and more assets in the
[11:48.840 --> 11:56.200]  ground in Africa Russia is the richest piece of real estate in the world just
[11:56.200 --> 12:00.920]  by its geographic largesse but
[12:01.520 --> 12:06.480]  US corporations need to go into Russia we need to deal with Russia Russia is
[12:06.480 --> 12:11.520]  Christianizing Westernizing it's the EU that's unelected and tyrannical it's the
[12:11.520 --> 12:15.400]  real problem it's linked up with the chai comms and Hollywood and the big banks
[12:15.400 --> 12:20.600]  and it's all part of that Bilderberg Europe slash Anglo-American establishment
[12:20.600 --> 12:24.280]  combine that Carol Quigley and Zabigny presents he all wrote about I mean they
[12:24.280 --> 12:27.720]  write about them in all the white papers and then I read the white papers and
[12:27.720 --> 12:31.240]  know how the world works and for decades I'm on air and they're telling you
[12:31.240 --> 12:34.720]  Bilderberg doesn't exist Jones is completely insane there's no plan for a
[12:34.720 --> 12:38.240]  shiny century there's no plan for this and that now it's all admitted and the
[12:38.240 --> 12:44.680]  real discussions are out in the open so Trump blasted him before he went he
[12:44.680 --> 12:48.720]  blasted him when he got there because it's the truth and the days of us being
[12:48.720 --> 12:51.960]  told at the end of World War two that well we're the global power so we've
[12:51.960 --> 12:55.000]  got to hand it over to these bureaucracies and these corporations and
[12:55.000 --> 12:59.880]  then becomes subservient to a world government we build not going to happen
[12:59.880 --> 13:05.560]  and they go oh he's destroying the world order now I went up first air as we go
[13:05.560 --> 13:11.080]  to break this powerful montage that Darren McBreen put together that needs to
[13:11.080 --> 13:14.160]  go viral I mean it's gone viral on Facebook and YouTube it needs to be
[13:14.160 --> 13:18.640]  seen by millions it's only been seen by about 500,000 watch the left killing
[13:18.640 --> 13:23.680]  babies is the name of the video watch the left celebrate the killing of babies
[13:23.680 --> 13:27.400]  when they talk about how much they love these kids and you know say release all
[13:27.400 --> 13:30.320]  the kids out of these emergency centers remember what they really think here it
[13:30.320 --> 13:35.320]  is so tonight in honor of America I'd like to do a salute to abortion in the

[19:18.240 --> 19:20.240]  and for regularity and so much more.
[19:20.240 --> 19:24.240]  And it synergistically works with our 50 billion live, active culture,
[19:24.240 --> 19:28.240]  floral life, as well as MycoZX that targets the yeast, the mold,
[19:28.240 --> 19:30.240]  and the funguses in the gut.
[19:30.240 --> 19:34.240]  So this is the time to take advantage of getting this new incredible fiber product
[19:34.240 --> 19:36.240]  and these other products.
[19:36.240 --> 19:39.240]  You get them separately or together and make really, really big savings
[19:39.240 --> 19:41.240]  and get high quality products at the same time.
[19:41.240 --> 19:43.240]  And I'm doing this to introduce these products to you.
[19:43.240 --> 19:46.240]  Bodies sold out in a month.
[19:46.240 --> 19:49.240]  Strongest concentrated turmeric formula we could come up with.
[19:49.240 --> 19:51.240]  It's sold out for another month and a half.
[19:51.240 --> 19:54.240]  We sold it at 50% off till it's sold out.
[19:54.240 --> 19:57.240]  And I think it's going to be the same way with this fiber.
[19:57.240 --> 20:26.240]  Get yours today in ForwardsLife.com.
[20:28.240 --> 20:30.240]  That's called nationalism.
[20:30.240 --> 20:31.240]  It's called free market.
[20:31.240 --> 20:33.240]  It's called Donald Trump.
[20:33.240 --> 20:35.240]  It's called the Info War.
[20:35.240 --> 20:38.240]  That's how we get out of here.
[20:38.240 --> 20:42.240]  We have a private corporate world government that thinks it's God
[20:42.240 --> 20:48.240]  that is using high tech weaponized propaganda through Hollywood and the media
[20:48.240 --> 20:54.240]  to brainwash and dumb down the general population while turning us against each other
[20:54.240 --> 21:00.240]  while weaponizing giant third world populations and pointing them at the west
[21:00.240 --> 21:04.240]  in an attempt to bankrupt civilization.
[21:04.240 --> 21:09.240]  This is an attack on civilization because the globalists are a breakaway civilization
[21:09.240 --> 21:14.240]  that are tax exempt, that are waging war against the old civilization
[21:14.240 --> 21:21.240]  and are extracting its wealth, its ideas, its resources into the new corporate reservations.
[21:21.240 --> 21:31.240]  For the elite, the so-called elite, while then reducing us all down to the status of chattel serfs.
[21:31.240 --> 21:34.240]  And that is the admitted world government plan.
[21:34.240 --> 21:39.240]  It is 1,000% evil and out of control.
[21:39.240 --> 21:44.240]  And it is being rejected because it has been exposed.
[21:44.240 --> 21:49.240]  And the founder of UKIP, the man behind Brexit, Nigel Farage,
[21:49.240 --> 21:51.240]  has just recently spoken.
[21:51.240 --> 21:54.240]  The full speech is up on infowars.com.
[21:54.240 --> 21:58.240]  I suggest that you share it because it's powerful.
[21:58.240 --> 22:01.240]  He lays it all out.
[22:01.240 --> 22:06.240]  And he makes the point that most NATO members are freeloading off of American taxpayers
[22:06.240 --> 22:12.240]  that they are cheating and not following the agreements.
[22:12.240 --> 22:16.240]  Let's think about China and the WTO and NAFTA and GATT in Mexico.
[22:16.240 --> 22:22.240]  They don't even follow the agreements that are there that are still on one side.
[22:22.240 --> 22:26.240]  The UK pays its share. The US pays its share.
[22:26.240 --> 22:30.240]  No one else pays its share in NATO.
[22:30.240 --> 22:33.240]  They freeload off of it.
[22:33.240 --> 22:36.240]  And it's coming to an end.
[22:36.240 --> 22:39.240]  And they go, oh, you're pro-Russia. You want us to pay for NATO.
[22:39.240 --> 22:41.240]  What does that have to do with it?
[22:41.240 --> 22:44.240]  Trump's like,
[22:44.240 --> 22:46.240]  Merkel, you get 70% of your energy from Russia.
[22:46.240 --> 22:48.240]  You signed a big deal with them.
[22:48.240 --> 22:50.240]  By the way, I don't think that's bad.
[22:50.240 --> 22:52.240]  I think it's fine to buy energy from Russia.
[22:52.240 --> 22:54.240]  I don't want to encircle Russia.
[22:54.240 --> 22:57.240]  But economically, we should compete with Russia.
[22:57.240 --> 22:59.240]  Now, there's the tweet from the president.
[22:59.240 --> 23:03.240]  The United States is spending far more on NATO than any other country.
[23:03.240 --> 23:06.240]  This is not fair, nor is it acceptable.
[23:06.240 --> 23:10.240]  While these countries have been increasing their contributions to the state office,
[23:10.240 --> 23:13.240]  14 billion, I would add, they must do much more.
[23:13.240 --> 23:15.240]  The US is at 1%.
[23:15.240 --> 23:17.240]  The US is at 4%.
[23:17.240 --> 23:20.240]  And NATO benefits.
[23:20.240 --> 23:24.240]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to Nigel Farage, breaking it down.
[23:24.240 --> 23:28.240]  Why do you think the president is right to be tough on this issue?
[23:28.240 --> 23:31.240]  Well, the president's not being tough on the issue.
[23:31.240 --> 23:34.240]  The president is merely quoting the rules of the club.
[23:34.240 --> 23:39.240]  To be part of NATO, you've got to spend 2% of your GDP on defense.
[23:39.240 --> 23:45.240]  The fact is there are 29 members of NATO, and only six of them are actually paying the membership fee.
[23:45.240 --> 23:49.240]  So the argument is, why should America protect all these countries
[23:49.240 --> 23:52.240]  if they're not prepared to make a fair contribution?
[23:52.240 --> 23:54.240]  I think it's a wholly reasonable argument,
[23:54.240 --> 23:58.240]  but it's set, you see, against the background of the European Union,
[23:58.240 --> 24:02.240]  wants to build its own army, its own European army.
[24:02.240 --> 24:05.240]  And Mr. Juncker, who heads the European Commission,
[24:05.240 --> 24:08.240]  is saying you only need to pay 1%.
[24:08.240 --> 24:13.240]  And what you're going to hear in the next 48 hours are various European leaders
[24:13.240 --> 24:18.240]  saying Trump is threatening the security of people in Europe.
[24:18.240 --> 24:22.240]  The truth is, it's the ambitions of the European project that's doing it.
[24:22.240 --> 24:26.240]  And I believe that the president should be very firm indeed.
[24:26.240 --> 24:28.240]  It's crazy when you look at the numbers,
[24:28.240 --> 24:30.240]  because you see the United States at about 3.5%.
[24:30.240 --> 24:32.240]  You guys hit the market 2.1 too.
[24:32.240 --> 24:34.240]  We both got pretty big economies.
[24:34.240 --> 24:37.240]  So we're talking about on a big scale, 3.5% and 2%.
[24:37.240 --> 24:39.240]  And then you've got all these smaller countries
[24:39.240 --> 24:41.240]  who are just getting the deal of a lifetime
[24:41.240 --> 24:45.240]  paying maybe 1% of a very tiny GDP
[24:45.240 --> 24:48.240]  to join a club that gets you the backing of militaries
[24:48.240 --> 24:50.240]  that are worth trillions of dollars.
[24:50.240 --> 24:51.240]  I mean, what a sweet deal.
[24:51.240 --> 24:55.240]  And how could anybody not call them out is what I'm saying.
[24:55.240 --> 24:56.240]  Yeah, no, absolutely.
[24:56.240 --> 24:57.240]  I mean, it's free-laving, isn't it?
[24:57.240 --> 25:00.240]  But it's not just the small European countries that are cheating.
[25:00.240 --> 25:04.240]  Germany, you know, 80 million people, the biggest country in Europe,
[25:04.240 --> 25:08.240]  and Germany is only paying 1.2%.
[25:08.240 --> 25:11.240]  And I think that President Trump and Angela Merkel
[25:11.240 --> 25:13.240]  need to have a very frank discussion about that.
[25:13.240 --> 25:16.240]  Otherwise, as I say, European countries
[25:16.240 --> 25:19.240]  are freeloading off American taxpayers.
[25:19.240 --> 25:21.240]  That's totally true. That is absolutely true.
[25:21.240 --> 25:26.240]  Now, back here in the U.S., though, most U.S. media is saying,
[25:26.240 --> 25:27.240]  he's endangering us.
[25:27.240 --> 25:30.240]  He's trying to break up NATO for the Russians.
[25:30.240 --> 25:37.240]  Oh, no. The EU is way more communist than the Russians are.
[25:37.240 --> 25:40.240]  The EU is super authoritarian.
[25:40.240 --> 25:43.240]  It's allied with the Democratic Party.
[25:43.240 --> 25:46.240]  And you've got our giant GDP, the biggest in the world.
[25:46.240 --> 25:49.240]  We're paying almost 4% of our total GDP,
[25:49.240 --> 25:54.240]  which that's why we pay close to half of NATO.
[25:54.240 --> 25:57.240]  It's cost. That's the way to really look at it.
[25:57.240 --> 26:00.240]  Then you've got 20-something other countries
[26:00.240 --> 26:04.240]  that are paying 1%, 1.5%, when it's for their security
[26:04.240 --> 26:07.240]  and they claim they want us to contribute more.
[26:07.240 --> 26:10.240]  How about we just have a peace deal with Russia
[26:10.240 --> 26:12.240]  and then use NATO to control the borders
[26:12.240 --> 26:19.240]  and use NATO to basically be downsized
[26:19.240 --> 26:21.240]  or just have it revert back to nation states,
[26:21.240 --> 26:23.240]  having their own militaries?
[26:23.240 --> 26:25.240]  Because it's about global government.
[26:25.240 --> 26:29.240]  They don't want individual countries to have their own militaries.
[26:29.240 --> 26:32.240]  They want this big NATO army that's part of the EU,
[26:32.240 --> 26:37.240]  part of the UN, the World Government Police Force.
[26:37.240 --> 26:40.240]  And now the EU Police Force is this army,
[26:40.240 --> 26:42.240]  this secret army they're building,
[26:42.240 --> 26:44.240]  which their first enemy is nation states
[26:44.240 --> 26:49.240]  that try to control their borders.
[26:49.240 --> 26:54.240]  The American taxpayer is the laughing stock of the world.
[26:54.240 --> 26:56.240]  And it's over. That's all that's happening.
[26:56.240 --> 27:00.240]  And Trump is very pragmatically just asking them
[27:00.240 --> 27:02.240]  to back off of this just a little bit.
[27:02.240 --> 27:04.240]  Okay, let's go to Trump,
[27:04.240 --> 27:06.240]  a slams-mercle over Russia energy dependence.
[27:06.240 --> 27:07.240]  Here it is.
[27:07.240 --> 27:09.240]  Germany is totally controlled by Russia
[27:09.240 --> 27:13.240]  because they were getting from 60% to 70% of their energy
[27:13.240 --> 27:16.240]  from Russia and a new pipeline.
[27:16.240 --> 27:18.240]  And you tell me if that's appropriate,
[27:18.240 --> 27:19.240]  because I think it's not.
[27:19.240 --> 27:21.240]  And I think it's a very bad thing for NATO
[27:21.240 --> 27:23.240]  and I don't think it should have happened.
[27:23.240 --> 27:26.240]  And I think we have to talk to Germany about it.
[27:26.240 --> 27:29.240]  But Germany, as far as I'm concerned, is captive to Russia
[27:29.240 --> 27:33.240]  because it's getting so much of its energy from Russia.
[27:33.240 --> 27:35.240]  So we're supposed to protect Germany,
[27:35.240 --> 27:38.240]  but they're getting their energy from Russia.
[27:38.240 --> 27:39.240]  Explain that.
[27:39.240 --> 27:42.240]  And it can't be explained, you know.
[27:42.240 --> 27:44.240]  Unless you realize that the bureaucrats,
[27:44.240 --> 27:47.240]  the big banks, after World War II said we have nuclear weapons,
[27:47.240 --> 27:50.240]  we have all the technology, we have half the world's wealth,
[27:50.240 --> 27:55.240]  we're 4% of the population, take the middle class's money,
[27:55.240 --> 27:58.240]  don't use it to actually help countries industrialize
[27:58.240 --> 28:00.240]  and democratize,
[28:00.240 --> 28:05.240]  use it for global turmoil and control
[28:05.240 --> 28:08.240]  and let the big mega corporations extract all the wealth.
[28:08.240 --> 28:09.240]  So you look at this, you ask,
[28:09.240 --> 28:12.240]  where's all the money going that we give to the EU and the NATO?
[28:12.240 --> 28:14.240]  It goes to the contracts to big corporations
[28:14.240 --> 28:16.240]  that Bilderberg Group controls.
[28:16.240 --> 28:18.240]  And that's why they never wanted you to know
[28:18.240 --> 28:20.240]  that the Bilderberg Group existed
[28:20.240 --> 28:22.240]  because many of their own corporate documents
[28:22.240 --> 28:25.240]  have been leaked out of the National Archives to me.
[28:25.240 --> 28:30.240]  Number six years ago, we got leaked all the Senators' Private Papers,
[28:30.240 --> 28:32.240]  400 pages of it,
[28:32.240 --> 28:35.240]  and it was all the big plan to transfer our wealth to corporations
[28:35.240 --> 28:38.240]  and how to break the unions.
[28:38.240 --> 28:40.240]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[28:40.240 --> 28:58.240]  I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com, newswars.com.
[28:58.240 --> 29:00.240]  I had great results.
[29:00.240 --> 29:01.240]  I lost 70 pounds.
[29:01.240 --> 29:04.240]  I weighed 265 and went down to 195.
[29:04.240 --> 29:07.240]  My doctor told me if it works for you, then do it.
[29:07.240 --> 29:09.240]  A lot of people say to me, how did you lose the weight?
[29:09.240 --> 29:11.240]  I said, I take Andro 400 every day.
[29:11.240 --> 29:13.240]  I'm going to take it forever.
[29:13.240 --> 29:15.240]  That was Walt talking about Andro 400.
[29:15.240 --> 29:17.240]  Now listen to what Bob has to say.
[29:17.240 --> 29:19.240]  When you listen to your radio commercials,
[29:19.240 --> 29:20.240]  you say that's not possible,
[29:20.240 --> 29:22.240]  but since I've experienced it,
[29:22.240 --> 29:24.240]  your commercials aren't strong enough.
[29:24.240 --> 29:27.240]  I am 76 and I've had a belly for way too long.
[29:27.240 --> 29:29.240]  My whole body is shrinking.
[29:29.240 --> 29:30.240]  My energy level has gone up.
[29:30.240 --> 29:32.240]  And the only thing difference is Andro 400.
[29:32.240 --> 29:33.240]  It's great stuff.
[29:33.240 --> 29:35.240]  I tried other products and nothing happened.
[29:35.240 --> 29:38.240]  Guys, if you'd like to lose stubborn belly fat,
[29:38.240 --> 29:41.240]  gain energy and feel years younger,
[29:41.240 --> 29:43.240]  try Andro 400.

[29:56.240 --> 30:08.240]  Andro400.com.
[30:26.240 --> 30:28.240]  And now because of their intensifying censorship,
[30:28.240 --> 30:30.240]  it's more important than ever
[30:30.240 --> 30:33.240]  that everyone go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter
[30:33.240 --> 30:35.240]  and sign up via email
[30:35.240 --> 30:37.240]  so there's no way the censors can get between us
[30:37.240 --> 30:39.240]  with critical videos, articles,
[30:39.240 --> 30:41.240]  breaking news, intel, you name it.
[30:41.240 --> 30:44.240]  And so now I ask you more than ever
[30:44.240 --> 30:46.240]  to share the infowars.com articles,
[30:46.240 --> 30:47.240]  to share the videos,
[30:47.240 --> 30:49.240]  to tell people by the local stations you're listening to,
[30:49.240 --> 30:51.240]  but the bare minimum you can do
[30:51.240 --> 30:53.240]  is sign up for the free newsletter
[30:53.240 --> 30:57.240]  at infowars.com forward slash newsletter.

[31:02.240 --> 31:04.240]  is a serious health issue.
[31:04.240 --> 31:06.240]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters,
[31:06.240 --> 31:09.240]  but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet,
[31:09.240 --> 31:11.240]  shower and sink in your home.
[31:11.240 --> 31:13.240]  That's why we're bringing you something

[31:38.240 --> 31:40.240]  With its broad spectrum contaminant reduction,
[31:40.240 --> 31:42.240]  you'll only need this one filter
[31:42.240 --> 31:45.240]  for clean and refreshing water all over your home.
[31:45.240 --> 31:47.240]  Head to infowarsstore.com
[31:47.240 --> 31:50.240]  and whether it's your first water filtration purchase
[31:50.240 --> 31:53.240]  or you're looking to replace your current run-down systems,
[31:53.240 --> 31:55.240]  it's time to go big and go home
[31:55.240 --> 31:59.240]  with the Pro Pure Whole House Filtration System today.
[31:59.240 --> 32:03.240]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[32:03.240 --> 32:06.240]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates,
[32:06.240 --> 32:09.240]  but a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater
[32:09.240 --> 32:12.240]  and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[32:12.240 --> 32:16.240]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles,
[32:16.240 --> 32:19.240]  and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[32:19.240 --> 32:21.240]  to unhealthy levels.
[32:21.240 --> 32:24.240]  To find out, we employed a series of tests
[32:24.240 --> 32:27.240]  for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[32:27.240 --> 32:29.240]  What we learned was that there was, in fact,
[32:29.240 --> 32:33.240]  unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[32:33.240 --> 32:37.240]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure Gravity Filter,
[32:37.240 --> 32:40.240]  and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure,
[32:40.240 --> 32:44.240]  but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[32:44.240 --> 32:47.240]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure
[32:47.240 --> 32:49.240]  raises the pH of the water.
[32:49.240 --> 32:52.240]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain
[32:52.240 --> 32:55.240]  can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[32:55.240 --> 32:59.240]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[33:03.240 --> 33:06.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:11.240 --> 33:15.240]  A lot of his supporters believe that we are the enemy of the American people,
[33:15.240 --> 33:18.240]  because it's a really, really awful situation.
[33:18.240 --> 33:20.240]  We are not the enemy of the American people.
[33:20.240 --> 33:22.240]  We love the American people.
[33:32.240 --> 33:35.240]  We are not the enemy of the American people.
[33:35.240 --> 33:38.240]  We love the American people. We love the American people.
[33:39.240 --> 33:41.240]  We love the American people.
[33:42.240 --> 33:43.240]  They came in peace.
[33:55.240 --> 33:59.240]  We are not the enemy of the American people. We love the American people.
[33:59.240 --> 34:00.240]  We love the American people.
[34:07.240 --> 34:09.240]  This is CNN.
[34:13.240 --> 34:17.240]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[34:21.240 --> 34:25.240]  Alex Jones here, back live on this Wednesday global edition.
[34:25.240 --> 34:29.240]  We've got a ton of other news I haven't gotten to yet.
[34:34.240 --> 34:40.240]  I do want to open the phones up and take your calls throughout the balance of the broadcast.
[34:40.240 --> 34:43.240]  We do have several guests popping in as well.
[34:45.240 --> 34:51.240]  And I don't really screen your calls, but I like to know how you're listening or what you specifically want to talk about.
[34:51.240 --> 34:58.240]  But sometimes when I open the field up too much, it doesn't let us really get the sense of the listeners, the sense of the viewers,
[34:58.240 --> 35:03.240]  that I really respect and want to know, kind of conducting an on-air poll.
[35:04.240 --> 35:10.240]  I've been accused by some people, as I've seen it out there on infowars.com and newswars.com,
[35:10.240 --> 35:21.240]  and some of the comments of being a sellout, because I'm not more angry at Trump for his second Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
[35:22.240 --> 35:28.240]  And I've done a lot of research on him. I've got mixed views, but the president certainly could have done a lot worse,
[35:28.240 --> 35:32.240]  and Hillary Clinton certainly would have done a lot worse.
[35:32.240 --> 35:41.240]  And the first Supreme Court justice he put in, a lot of experts say, like Judge Andrew DePolitano, couldn't have been better.
[35:45.240 --> 35:52.240]  But that said, look at everything else Trump's doing on hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of billions,
[35:52.240 --> 36:02.240]  and well, now trillions of new investment in the U.S. on wages, skyrocketing, on jobless claims being record low, on optimism, on border control,
[36:02.240 --> 36:15.240]  on killing the TPP that was the jewel in the crown of world government, of exposing the authoritarian European Union.
[36:15.240 --> 36:27.240]  The list goes on and on. So my question to listeners is in general, we expect instant gratification to turn things around against global government.
[36:30.240 --> 36:36.240]  But Trump is as close to instant gratification as you're going to get. He's clearly for real.
[36:36.240 --> 36:39.240]  He's clearly pragmatic and isn't out to get America.
[36:39.240 --> 36:54.240]  He clearly wants a stable, free planet. And compared to the arrogant, wild Ivy League control freak technocrats that have been running things for 50, 60 years,
[36:54.240 --> 37:00.240]  he is a breath of fresh air for like a diver who's been down 100 feet and barely makes it to the surface.
[37:00.240 --> 37:15.240]  I'm just gasping in not even satisfaction, not even in vitriol against the Democrats and their constituents and all of their frothing and bullying and screeching and
[37:15.240 --> 37:35.240]  peeling and scratching and biting. It's just such a dichotomy that at a gut level, at a level in my chest actually, in my heart, I just feel thankful to God for the reprieve that we've seen so far.
[37:35.240 --> 37:49.240]  And it makes the victories we've had hard fought and hard won that much more special. It makes me love this country and love humanity and love this planet and love all of you that love freedom and love justice.
[37:49.240 --> 37:58.240]  It just makes it that much more special. This great human adventure that we've been on together going back to the beginning of humankind.
[37:58.240 --> 38:10.240]  We aren't living in an epic time, an epic struggle, and they are targeting those of us that are on the front line viciously in all sorts of horrible ways.
[38:10.240 --> 38:24.240]  But it actually doesn't hurt me and doesn't make me depressed. It just reminds me how bad our enemies are and that we've been on the right track and that quite frankly, we weren't strong enough in our condemnation of these people.
[38:24.240 --> 38:34.240]  But I don't screen your calls. You can agree. You can disagree. You know, sometimes we only open the phones up for people that disagree.
[38:34.240 --> 38:46.240]  So let's do that for the first 15 calls or so. And then that'll take us well into the next hour. The phones are only open and I don't want tongue-in-cheek sarcasm, please.
[38:46.240 --> 38:57.240]  We get a lot of that when I do this every once in a while. I want to open up the phones only. So don't call in till later if you agree or have a side point.
[38:57.240 --> 39:11.240]  If you disagree with me about Trump being good and about Trump being real and if you disagree on anything we've talked about and you want to call me out, I think it's important to hear from you.
[39:11.240 --> 39:24.240]  I want to hear from Hillary supporters. I want to hear from some of the holier-than-thou conservatives that because Trump's had a big tent, you think he's a bad guy.
[39:24.240 --> 39:40.240]  I really want to hear from you and hear how you're not thinking you're lucky stars that not just here but all over the world, nationalist, populist, free market candidates are winning and in the lead in major elections coming up.
[39:40.240 --> 39:59.240]  And with it, like oxygen coming back into the room, we see prosperity returning and it doesn't mean we don't have giant problems of screen sickness from the TV screens and the smart phones.
[39:59.240 --> 40:07.240]  It doesn't mean we don't have 5G coming in and GMO and companies trying to force inoculate and all the targeting of children and the brainwashing.
[40:07.240 --> 40:20.240]  We're in trouble but we're starting to struggle back against the very global government structures and their propaganda arms that are carrying out the brainwashing.
[40:20.240 --> 40:29.240]  So that's where I come to you from and I'm just very, very thankful and I ask the question, am I wrong to be thankful?
[40:29.240 --> 40:39.240]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-Alex. Callers that disagree first. I want to give you the floor. 877-789-2539.
[40:39.240 --> 40:55.240]  Frank hasn't called in since we made a fun ad with him. Frank always disagrees. Maybe Frank will call in. Need your help, Frank? 877-789-2539 is the number. 877-789-ALEH.
[40:55.240 --> 41:14.240]  Now, that said, I told you the 4th of July special was going to have to end yesterday and I got here early and we had some other issues to take care of and I did not shoot the ads for several new products that are not even on the shopping cart yet.
[41:14.240 --> 41:26.240]  Oh, they're there now. Wow. But I'm not even ready to launch the new products and the new official app that works a lot better than the last one. It's really great and it's free.
[41:26.240 --> 41:47.240]  But it's all at infowars.com or infowars.com. You can just go there. You'll see a banner there soon. But we are extending the July 4th Second American Revolution week sales one more day just because, again, I need to cut an ad for our new product.
[41:47.240 --> 42:00.240]  That's amazing. And I need to cut an ad for the new app that's even more amazing, has push notifications, live video feeds, a whole bunch of audio feeds, everything listed, the podcast all listed.
[42:00.240 --> 42:16.240]  It's got the thing where you can turn off the video and just listen to the audio. It's got a lot of functions. People ask for and it's absolutely free. It's the infowars official app for Android and for Apple systems, the iPhone systems.
[42:16.240 --> 42:26.240]  And we're the tip of the spear. We're the group that's demonized. We're the group they're trying to suppress. We're the group they're trying to shut down because they want to beta test on info wars for everybody else.
[42:26.240 --> 42:39.240]  So when you download the app, when you share the app, when you tell friends and family about the free app, that's a great way to get them to find the show and to not be censored like YouTube and many others do to us now on Facebook.
[42:39.240 --> 42:46.240]  So this is something you can share the link to infowars.com forward slash app. Stay with us.
[42:46.240 --> 43:09.240]  Thank you.

[45:00.240 --> 45:09.240]  Alex Jones here with an extremely exciting announcement that will be a gift to yourself and a gift to the info war to fight the globalist and limited free society.

[45:59.240 --> 46:12.240]  This 4th of July is special. Everybody can see it. They can feel it. The globalists are attempting to kill a worldwide awakening to their tyranny and America yet again is at the heart of the resistance, the globalist.
[46:12.240 --> 46:22.240]  That's why this 4th of July I'm asking all of our great supporters to think about info wars now more than ever and what would the world be like if info wars wasn't there resisting the globalist.
[46:22.240 --> 46:30.240]  What would have happened if you hadn't supported info wars? We would not be having the pictures we have today. So yes, a lot of good things are happening, but the enemy is striking back.
[46:30.240 --> 46:37.240]  So please think about info wars and funding or operation while you get great products at the same time on the 4th of July that's so historic.

[46:55.240 --> 47:11.240]  That's why this 4th of July is special and our sales are special to match it. infowarstore.com
[47:11.240 --> 47:25.240]  We shall go on to the end. We shall fight in France. We shall fight on the seas and oceans. We shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air.
[47:25.240 --> 47:42.240]  We shall defend our island, whatever the crust may be. We shall fight on the beaches. We shall fight on the landing grounds. We shall fight in the fields and in the streets. We shall fight in the hills. We shall never surrender.
[47:55.240 --> 48:20.240]  Calls are pouring in right now, people that disagree. Every time I do this we get some sarcastic jokers calling in, but we also get some serious people and it's always really sad to hear how misinformed they are but it's also quite illuminating.
[48:20.240 --> 48:29.240]  But there's always people that are holier than them who say Trump isn't doing enough or I'm not doing enough or we're really the establishment.
[48:29.240 --> 48:42.240]  I'm not trying to become an establishment. I'm trying to turn humanity loose and free. I don't want to be in New York or LA and be part of the end crowd. I don't go to award ceremonies.
[48:42.240 --> 48:57.240]  I'm trying to build something new like our forebears did when they went across the sea trying to find a new world to carry out their own religious freedom.
[48:57.240 --> 49:13.240]  And I see the success when we begin to co-op the establishment itself and turn it against itself and then to see America come back to life in just a year and a half. That's a really positive thing.
[49:13.240 --> 49:29.240]  I mean, you can't look at what Trump's doing policy-wise and not be pleased. 95% the very best policies you could have for a free and wealthy and successful country and planet.
[49:29.240 --> 49:37.240]  I can't believe he's at about 95% in my estimation. I mean, he's not a dictator and a dictator can't get stuff done either.
[49:37.240 --> 49:49.240]  And the way he is nuancing this, the way he is carrying all this out, he's devastating the globalist. Oh, they have blimps where he's a fat baby and a diaper.
[49:49.240 --> 49:58.240]  And they've got all the countless TV shows saying he's an idiot and he's a buffoon or he's evil or he's a mastermind.
[49:58.240 --> 50:07.240]  But if he's such an idiot, how is he beating all of the establishment?
[50:07.240 --> 50:15.240]  Well, the truth is, it's the establishment that are the great grandchildren of corrupt robber barons that took over.
[50:15.240 --> 50:29.240]  They didn't even do the stealing themselves and you are a bunch of back-scratching, back-slapping, nobodies.
[50:29.240 --> 50:39.240]  You're just establishment lackeys who have created incredible entropy, incredible stagnation.
[50:39.240 --> 50:50.240]  What is a swamp? It's stagnant. It's rotting. It's stinking. It's fedded. There isn't a lot of life in it.
[50:50.240 --> 50:59.240]  And what's happened since Trump came in? How do you clean out a swamp? You hit it with a hurricane.
[50:59.240 --> 51:10.240]  And boy, is it messy, but you better believe all the frothing and screaming and threatening and chirping that you hear out of the Democratic establishment.
[51:10.240 --> 51:19.240]  The Republican establishment is their death throws as they circle the drain of oblivion.
[51:19.240 --> 51:25.240]  But just removing one group of corrupt individuals that sold the nation out and parolated in a great wealth for themselves
[51:25.240 --> 51:32.240]  and told themselves what geniuses they were shelling off the most wealthy country in the world.
[51:32.240 --> 51:38.240]  We have to be moral ourselves and we have to move forward and we have to build a better world.
[51:38.240 --> 51:53.240]  Because getting rid of these people is just the first domino in a larger collapse that we need to see of their system if humanity is to be turned loose.
[51:53.240 --> 52:05.240]  And we're going to go to your phone calls and I said people disagreeing with Trump or disagreeing with me about his policies or about the fact that I'm being so positive.
[52:05.240 --> 52:13.240]  And then I read Mormons promoting globalism. Richard, okay, what does it do with Trump or me?
[52:13.240 --> 52:21.240]  I'll go to your call. It's just come on. Ginny in Florida. Trump is not taking care of vaccine issue. Bingo.
[52:21.240 --> 52:32.240]  Greg in Iowa. Alex is supporting the system. Johnny, video game does not cause violence.
[52:32.240 --> 52:43.240]  We're talking about disagreeing with me that Trump's good, but I'll still go to your call. Charlie in Chicago. Not a fan of Kavanaugh.
[52:43.240 --> 52:55.240]  I'm not really a fan of Kavanaugh either. What I'm saying is Trump needs to get someone nominated and Kavanaugh is way better than anybody Hillary Clinton would have had.
[52:55.240 --> 53:01.240]  And so I'm trusting Trump because I've seen him deliver over and over again when I thought it was wrong.
[53:01.240 --> 53:10.240]  Now, if I start seeing him deviate from that and not crushing globalism and not returning the Republic, then I will say, okay, you know, Trump's starting to roll over on us.
[53:10.240 --> 53:21.240]  But we're going to go to your calls. Let's go to Greg first because he says I am supporting the system. I want to explain something.
[53:21.240 --> 53:27.240]  The system, there's a lot of corrupt bad stuff in our system that's become anti-American.
[53:27.240 --> 53:38.240]  And Trump simply trying to secure the executive branch, stabilize the economy, and then get America better deals and get Americans back to work.
[53:38.240 --> 53:47.240]  The system is Hollywood and the mainstream media and the big banks and all of them are against Trump. The big banks gave zero money to Trump.
[53:47.240 --> 54:02.240]  Look it up. So I'm already arguing before I've gone to you. It's just, it's like people saying, oh, Jones, I bet you work for the CIA because that's just one agency they can name of 18 different agencies.
[54:02.240 --> 54:12.240]  And I'm like, I've never worked for any agency. I'm proud of the fact that I'm original Americana and that I helped reboot with our listeners.
[54:12.240 --> 54:21.240]  Americana and the Republic. So it's true that the president listens to me a lot. It's true that I've launched a lot of ideas to the campaign.
[54:21.240 --> 54:32.240]  It's true that the patriots that are in agencies listen to me. So you've got it backwards. It's not some power trip. They'll listen to the American people.
[54:32.240 --> 54:37.240]  We just haven't had a big enough movement in this country to ever relaunch America.
[54:37.240 --> 54:56.240]  But I believe that compared to UN, global government, CHICOM controlled Hollywood attacking the family, sexualizing three year olds, that if we promoted free market capitalism and success against the system they were bringing in that we could reboot the old system
[54:56.240 --> 55:04.240]  and use patriots in the current system to have a bloodless revolution of ideas.
[55:04.240 --> 55:20.240]  So now that Trump is somewhat ensconced and has a larger beachhead, I guess you could say in a couple years if Trump totally vanquishes the globalist and is really reforming things and fixing things, I will say I'm now a system man
[55:20.240 --> 55:33.240]  because I want the American system. I want free market. I want low taxes. I want our republic. I want to secure the dreams of our ancestors. I want to move forward.
[55:33.240 --> 55:42.240]  Does that make me part of the system that we're winning? We have to be ready to win. We have to be ready to take the country and the world back. We can do it.
[55:42.240 --> 55:49.240]  If we don't, the devil worshipers and the pedophiles and the control freaks, they're going to fill that vacuum.
[55:49.240 --> 55:57.240]  They're going to erect the authoritarian systems like the PPP that run our country and our world. Yes, I like the American system.
[55:57.240 --> 56:07.240]  I guess I've been involved dynamiting the globalist operation. Does that make me part of the system? Go ahead, Greg and I'll hear on the air.
[56:07.240 --> 56:16.240]  Yes, Alex. Thank you. You've spent about five minutes already basically putting words in my mouth. I hope you'll give me the amount of time to respond to you. Thank you.
[56:16.240 --> 56:26.240]  I'm not going to interrupt because you did that because I was going to go to you for two minutes, but I'm going to sit here now and I'm going to explain to you that I was in general responding to people saying I'm part of the system.
[56:26.240 --> 56:39.240]  I didn't put words in your mouth. I said what I stood for. That's an ad hominem attack. I said what I stand for in the main and who I am before I went to you to make your statement, your claim.
[56:39.240 --> 56:54.240]  So the authoritarian claim of you hope you get five minutes before you get your five minutes is again a way to totally change the subject of the fact that I just opened the phones up because I wanted to hear from what you had to say.
[56:54.240 --> 56:59.240]  Go ahead. You got 45 seconds and I'll come back to you after the break. Just go ahead.
[56:59.240 --> 57:09.240]  All right. Well, Alex, I think when I say you support the system, I don't mean to say that it's wrong to have hope and say that someone in Trump or in the Trump administration because we did dodge a bullet with Clinton.
[57:09.240 --> 57:14.240]  We know how bad Clinton would have been. But I mean, Alex, let's keep you safe from very disturbing things the last couple of months.
[57:14.240 --> 57:26.240]  I mean, you've said that Trump, the possibility of Trump bringing in Rex 84,000 more so long before the good of humanity. You've had a guest on to say that Trump is fulfilling God's plans.
[57:26.240 --> 57:33.240]  This guy said that God is working through Trump and that Trump isn't doing anything. It's all God and that God, you can Trump defeat the Illuminati.
[57:33.240 --> 57:37.240]  You not realize how dangerous this is, Alex. This is called what?
[57:37.240 --> 57:44.240]  Let's come back. I think he raised some reasonable points, Greg. So we're going to come back. Stay with us.

[1:00:09.240 --> 1:00:19.240]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[1:00:19.240 --> 1:00:32.240]  Okay, so Greg and Iowa called in and I've got the phones up and people that disagree with things I've said or things that Trump's doing or I mean in general that think that you know Trump's not as good as folks think.
[1:00:32.240 --> 1:00:41.240]  I think it's important to look at both sides of this. When I go on air and I have a understanding or an epiphany, I just tell the truth.
[1:00:41.240 --> 1:00:51.240]  And the caller move real fast with Rex 84, which to a great extent I popularized.
[1:00:51.240 --> 1:00:56.240]  And then pastors and people saying God's working through Trump.
[1:00:56.240 --> 1:01:04.240]  I mean, I think that's clearly happening. Look at Roe v Wade, look at him at the pro life marches. I mean, he's got the, he's got the devils upset.
[1:01:04.240 --> 1:01:10.240]  I think Providence is taking place, but I'll let the caller finish up and then I'll get into the Rex 84.
[1:01:10.240 --> 1:01:19.240]  I was explaining that that was left as propaganda about Reagan's plan to the people in concentration camps, and that I even went along with it for years.
[1:01:19.240 --> 1:01:26.240]  And then Clinton did have a plan for that. And then Obama and Bush as well. And we exposed it all.
[1:01:26.240 --> 1:01:37.240]  But then when I saw them call the emergency centers concentration camps, I understood that they knew the left was planning to flood us with open borders before, just like the EU had planned.
[1:01:37.240 --> 1:01:46.240]  And they were doing it again. And so Trump had just authorized using military bases as emergency centers because they're saying the inflows already up 300%.
[1:01:46.240 --> 1:01:52.240]  It may go up even more. So they had to process this as it's meant to break our border and that's a form of civil emergency.
[1:01:52.240 --> 1:01:58.240]  So now I was seeing the leftist propaganda that programmed me so many decades ago.
[1:01:58.240 --> 1:02:15.240]  So I was not endorsing the leftist version of martial law or Rex 84, but the civil emergency to stop the collapse, the border just like Austria and Hungary and others are now mobilizing their military and declaring an emergency because there's a record influx of another 10 million men.
[1:02:15.240 --> 1:02:24.240]  Just like they already got hit by 10 million men Islamist. And so yes, that's what you have civil emergencies for is the border or for plagues or things like that.
[1:02:24.240 --> 1:02:30.240]  Not the leftist martial law of arresting conservatives or silencing people's free speech. I'd be 100% against that.
[1:02:30.240 --> 1:02:37.240]  So that's I wanted to just answer that one little smidgen of what you said. Go ahead.
[1:02:37.240 --> 1:02:47.240]  All right. Well, Alex, I must say I am glad that you came to realize that Ronnie Reagan and the Iran Contra criminal Oliver North were correct all along about about Rex 84.
[1:02:47.240 --> 1:02:53.240]  It was just the evil globalists that humanizing them. I mean, so I'm glad you I'm glad you came to an epiphany on that.
[1:02:53.240 --> 1:03:04.240]  But you know, in general, though, Alex, I think though he's kind of claimed this going on, not just you, it's all throughout the alternative media that like the Trump is this almost like this Godlike figure.
[1:03:04.240 --> 1:03:13.240]  And I think when you do that, you're basically you're putting you're giving a sense to people that they cannot criticize Trump because if they criticize Trump, they're criticizing God because God is working.
[1:03:13.240 --> 1:03:20.240]  I think this is dangerous. I think it's cult like and I think that people should be better than this. And I think it's dangerous.
[1:03:20.240 --> 1:03:26.240]  Well, I don't think Trump's God. I mean, certainly it's good that he's not letting us have one sided trade deals.
[1:03:26.240 --> 1:03:37.240]  And it's good that he's trying to take care of the veterans and it's good he's trying to secure the border. And it's good he's getting us out of the TPP. And it's good that we've got record employment and the globalists are out to get us.
[1:03:37.240 --> 1:03:46.240]  OK, and they hate Trump. And so we're in a total war right now to get the country back. So I have been very supportive of the president.
[1:03:46.240 --> 1:03:51.240]  I've also been critical of some of the military things. I've been critical of some of the vaccine stuff.
[1:03:51.240 --> 1:03:59.240]  But I'm very thankful for what he's doing right now with the one sided payment system on NATO. I mean, I just.
[1:03:59.240 --> 1:04:09.240]  I really don't see him as a Christlike figure. But I also, in the words of Pontius Pilate, find no wrong in him in his policies.
[1:04:09.240 --> 1:04:15.240]  He's not trying to hurt people, I don't think.
[1:04:15.240 --> 1:04:23.240]  Yeah, well, I would say, though, you did say that Trump doesn't have any type of, you know, big money behind him as far as, like, billionaire or globalist.
[1:04:23.240 --> 1:04:25.240]  I mean, you know, Sheldon Nalton gave him millions of dollars.
[1:04:25.240 --> 1:04:33.240]  He had Louis Eisenberg on his inaugural committee, who is the person with the head of New York Port Authority, put the buildings in the hands of Lucky Larry Silverstein.
[1:04:33.240 --> 1:04:39.240]  And by the way, I mean, you know, I love that Mueller is going to go down for 9-11 when personal attorney Rudy Giuliani.
[1:04:39.240 --> 1:04:46.240]  We'll be, we'll be right back and have you finish up, Greg. Stay with us.
[1:04:46.240 --> 1:04:50.240]  Tomorrow's news today. Have you spread the links today?
[1:04:50.240 --> 1:04:57.240]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:04:57.240 --> 1:05:00.240]  I want to plow into all of this.
[1:05:00.240 --> 1:05:18.240]  But I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books or videos or other material from infowarstore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[1:05:18.240 --> 1:05:20.240]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[1:05:20.240 --> 1:05:24.240]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at infowarstore.com.
[1:05:24.240 --> 1:05:31.240]  I want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[1:05:31.240 --> 1:05:33.240]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[1:05:33.240 --> 1:05:36.240]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[1:05:36.240 --> 1:05:39.240]  That's my dad with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[1:05:39.240 --> 1:05:43.240]  Infowarslife.com or triple-A-253-3139.
[1:05:43.240 --> 1:05:50.240]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[1:05:50.240 --> 1:05:55.240]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us so we need your support.
[1:06:21.240 --> 1:06:23.240]  You got it, you got it.
[1:06:26.240 --> 1:06:33.240]  All right, we are taking phone calls about people that disagree with me that Trump is really good.
[1:06:33.240 --> 1:06:39.240]  And we've gotten to one caller and already spent part of two segments with him.
[1:06:39.240 --> 1:06:48.240]  I'm going to finish up with him here in a moment because we've got a bunch of really interesting calls like Jason, Hillary supporter, country will be better with her.
[1:06:48.240 --> 1:06:52.240]  Jay in Michigan, how can Alex stand behind Trump separating families?
[1:06:52.240 --> 1:06:55.240]  David does not like Alex's style on air sometimes.
[1:06:55.240 --> 1:06:58.240]  Okay, I don't like my style sometimes.
[1:06:58.240 --> 1:07:04.240]  I'm talking about what you really disagree with me on policy-wise.
[1:07:04.240 --> 1:07:05.240]  I'll still go to your call.
[1:07:05.240 --> 1:07:08.240]  Johnny and Dallas, video games do not cause violence.
[1:07:08.240 --> 1:07:11.240]  Well, I'm going to debate that with you.
[1:07:11.240 --> 1:07:14.240]  I think that's an oversimplification, but we'll talk about it.
[1:07:14.240 --> 1:07:18.240]  Greg in Iowa, Alex is supporting the system, that's what we're talking to now.
[1:07:18.240 --> 1:07:22.240]  Jenny says Trump is not taking care of vaccine issue.
[1:07:22.240 --> 1:07:24.240]  That's the big one right there.
[1:07:24.240 --> 1:07:25.240]  That's the bingo.
[1:07:25.240 --> 1:07:27.240]  That and keeping Afghanistan war going.
[1:07:27.240 --> 1:07:31.240]  I mean, I want to hold Trump's feet to the fire.
[1:07:31.240 --> 1:07:34.240]  Richard in Arizona, Mormons promoting globalism.
[1:07:34.240 --> 1:07:35.240]  We'll go to him.
[1:07:35.240 --> 1:07:40.240]  Larry, Trump policies on pain medication, a crisis for Americans.
[1:07:40.240 --> 1:07:42.240]  So we'll hear people's beefs with Trump.
[1:07:42.240 --> 1:07:46.240]  I spent much of the first hour, the great job he's doing exposing NATO,
[1:07:46.240 --> 1:07:53.240]  how the U.S. pays roughly half of it, how Merkel is becoming a tool of Russia,
[1:07:53.240 --> 1:07:57.240]  while saying that Trump's some type of operative of Russia.
[1:07:57.240 --> 1:07:59.240]  I mean, really a lot of fireworks, a lot of clips.
[1:07:59.240 --> 1:08:02.240]  DOJ attorney Lisa Page refuses to testify to Congress.
[1:08:02.240 --> 1:08:04.240]  A lot of experts say she's got something to hide,
[1:08:04.240 --> 1:08:05.240]  but of course she's got something to hide.
[1:08:05.240 --> 1:08:08.240]  She's been caught red-handed rigging everything.
[1:08:08.240 --> 1:08:13.240]  MSNBC says Trump has evil desire against illegal immigrants, unbelievable.
[1:08:13.240 --> 1:08:15.240]  African migrants threatened to kill.
[1:08:15.240 --> 1:08:18.240]  Italian cargo vessel crew who rescues them.
[1:08:18.240 --> 1:08:20.240]  That's up on infowars.com.
[1:08:20.240 --> 1:08:22.240]  Sweden cuts welfare to pay for migrants.
[1:08:22.240 --> 1:08:25.240]  That's a voice of Europe up on infowars.com.
[1:08:25.240 --> 1:08:29.240]  Deadly parasite worm coming to Europe due to third-world migration.
[1:08:29.240 --> 1:08:31.240]  Unmasking Antifa Act in-house.
[1:08:31.240 --> 1:08:35.240]  Proposes 15-year prison term for wearing a mask and committing a crime.
[1:08:35.240 --> 1:08:38.240]  Well, yeah.
[1:08:38.240 --> 1:08:42.240]  So we're going to be getting to that and so much more.
[1:08:42.240 --> 1:08:45.240]  But going back to the caller if he just joined us,
[1:08:45.240 --> 1:08:51.240]  he's kind of rapid fire making accusations and moving on.
[1:08:51.240 --> 1:08:58.240]  Trump owns or has his name on or has businesses in something like 500 buildings,
[1:08:58.240 --> 1:09:01.240]  a couple hundred big skyscrapers.
[1:09:01.240 --> 1:09:03.240]  And yeah, we all know he's from New York City.
[1:09:03.240 --> 1:09:09.240]  And we know that he went on local Fox television and CNN.
[1:09:09.240 --> 1:09:13.240]  We have the clips and said that he thought there were bombs in the buildings
[1:09:13.240 --> 1:09:15.240]  and that it should be investigated.
[1:09:15.240 --> 1:09:20.240]  And that he went in those buildings with his engineer
[1:09:20.240 --> 1:09:23.240]  and that they believe the World Trade Centers were blown up.
[1:09:23.240 --> 1:09:28.240]  Now, is that the guy who's involved in 9-11?
[1:09:28.240 --> 1:09:29.240]  The answer is no.
[1:09:29.240 --> 1:09:34.240]  And there's no evidence Donald Trump's involved in 9-11.
[1:09:34.240 --> 1:09:36.240]  He did expose Jeff Bush and say,
[1:09:36.240 --> 1:09:38.240]  your brother, it happened when your brother was watching.
[1:09:38.240 --> 1:09:42.240]  He's trying to move forward with lawsuits exposing the Saudi connection,
[1:09:42.240 --> 1:09:45.240]  which then goes back to the 28 pages and the fact that they were working
[1:09:45.240 --> 1:09:48.240]  with the Clintons and the Bushes and that it was an inside job.
[1:09:48.240 --> 1:09:50.240]  They had bombs inside building 7.
[1:09:50.240 --> 1:09:53.240]  I'm the guy that popularized all that,
[1:09:53.240 --> 1:09:56.240]  but then the media misrepresented what I said about it all.
[1:09:56.240 --> 1:09:58.240]  So here's the deal.
[1:09:58.240 --> 1:10:02.240]  Here's a concerted massive assault against Trump.
[1:10:02.240 --> 1:10:04.240]  If you go to the campaign finance rules,
[1:10:04.240 --> 1:10:07.240]  I'm not talking about fellow hotel and casino owners.
[1:10:07.240 --> 1:10:09.240]  You know, you don't give them any $100 million.
[1:10:09.240 --> 1:10:11.240]  Everybody knows about that.
[1:10:11.240 --> 1:10:12.240]  I'm not talking about that.
[1:10:12.240 --> 1:10:18.240]  I'm saying 99% of the big bank contributions went to Hillary Clinton,
[1:10:18.240 --> 1:10:20.240]  less than 1% to Trump.
[1:10:20.240 --> 1:10:23.240]  And when they found out some of the employees at Goldman Sachs
[1:10:23.240 --> 1:10:24.240]  were giving him donations,
[1:10:24.240 --> 1:10:30.240]  they put a memo out saying, you will be fired.
[1:10:30.240 --> 1:10:33.240]  That was even the Wall Street Journal if you give money to Trump.
[1:10:33.240 --> 1:10:37.240]  So yeah, some of the brokers at Goldman Sachs got caught giving him,
[1:10:37.240 --> 1:10:41.240]  you know, $10,000, whatever, to super PACs.
[1:10:41.240 --> 1:10:45.240]  Hillary Clinton has the UN, the Chi Comps, Hollywood.
[1:10:45.240 --> 1:10:46.240]  You turn on Netflix.
[1:10:46.240 --> 1:10:51.240]  You turn on all 95% of television news coverage is negative against Trump.
[1:10:51.240 --> 1:10:52.240]  Every late night show.
[1:10:52.240 --> 1:10:57.240]  It's a total war with the entire stinking establishment
[1:10:57.240 --> 1:11:02.240]  trying to bring down Trump.
[1:11:02.240 --> 1:11:05.240]  And all he's trying to do is kickstart the country,
[1:11:05.240 --> 1:11:06.240]  defibrillate the heart.
[1:11:06.240 --> 1:11:08.240]  And he's got the heart going again.
[1:11:08.240 --> 1:11:09.240]  Yeah, there is Goldman Sachs,
[1:11:09.240 --> 1:11:11.240]  Bands Employees with Donated Trump.
[1:11:11.240 --> 1:11:12.240]  Fortune magazine.
[1:11:12.240 --> 1:11:15.240]  I mean, you know what makes me like Trump even more?
[1:11:15.240 --> 1:11:18.240]  It's that I've been persecuted for supporting Trump.
[1:11:18.240 --> 1:11:21.240]  I'm like a dog you're trying to take a bone away from.
[1:11:21.240 --> 1:11:24.240]  I mean, you know, you get bit.
[1:11:24.240 --> 1:11:26.240]  And I'm not mind controlled.
[1:11:26.240 --> 1:11:29.240]  I'm not into people that are celebrities.
[1:11:29.240 --> 1:11:31.240]  I didn't really pay attention to Hollywood celebrities.
[1:11:31.240 --> 1:11:37.240]  I thought Donald Trump was goofy, funny, you know, a guy doing PR for his hotels.
[1:11:37.240 --> 1:11:41.240]  You know, I'd hear him, you know, in steak ads and MLM ads on the radio.
[1:11:41.240 --> 1:11:43.240]  Just thought he's just another regular business guy.
[1:11:43.240 --> 1:11:47.240]  And then I studied him and how his dad was anti-New World Order
[1:11:47.240 --> 1:11:50.240]  and how his lawyer was the head McCarthy lawyer.
[1:11:50.240 --> 1:11:55.240]  And then I talked to people that are patriots and they said, you know,
[1:11:55.240 --> 1:11:56.240]  Trump knows everything.
[1:11:56.240 --> 1:11:59.240]  And then I talked to Trump.
[1:11:59.240 --> 1:12:05.240]  His dad was an anti-New World Order guy that sat right there in the belly of the beast
[1:12:05.240 --> 1:12:07.240]  and taught his son everything.
[1:12:07.240 --> 1:12:10.240]  And then his son quietly waited and quietly wanted the country to turn around.
[1:12:10.240 --> 1:12:17.240]  And now he's in and he's kicking their butts because he knows all their games.
[1:12:17.240 --> 1:12:21.240]  And he was never a white shoe guy who hung out in big groups of him.
[1:12:21.240 --> 1:12:23.240]  He was his own billionaire.
[1:12:23.240 --> 1:12:25.240]  And now he's taking it all away from him.
[1:12:25.240 --> 1:12:27.240]  I'll tell you this, though.
[1:12:27.240 --> 1:12:31.240]  If Trump was some really satanic distraction and some great diversion
[1:12:31.240 --> 1:12:33.240]  where he does all these great things and later betrays,
[1:12:33.240 --> 1:12:34.240]  that could be a problem.
[1:12:34.240 --> 1:12:35.240]  I'm not saying that.
[1:12:35.240 --> 1:12:36.240]  My gut doesn't tell me that.
[1:12:36.240 --> 1:12:39.240]  But he could be taking over the whole New World Order from them
[1:12:39.240 --> 1:12:43.240]  as just a shark coming in to take over all the other little sharks.
[1:12:43.240 --> 1:12:46.240]  But then why would he be giving us all prosperity?
[1:12:46.240 --> 1:12:48.240]  We'll continue to expect that.
[1:12:48.240 --> 1:12:52.240]  Trump's entire destiny and his family's destiny and name
[1:12:52.240 --> 1:12:58.240]  is tied to human success, American success, planetary victory.
[1:12:58.240 --> 1:13:00.240]  Victory for the world.
[1:13:00.240 --> 1:13:04.240]  And he's doing exactly what you do if you were trying to unravel
[1:13:04.240 --> 1:13:09.240]  the globalist plan for deindustrialization and ongoing crises and conflict.
[1:13:09.240 --> 1:13:13.240]  And he's done an incredible job taming the tiger
[1:13:13.240 --> 1:13:16.240]  and getting as much out of the system as he's done.
[1:13:16.240 --> 1:13:20.240]  So I'm just saying, my God, I'm glad Hillary's not in.
[1:13:20.240 --> 1:13:21.240]  You got two minutes to finish up.
[1:13:21.240 --> 1:13:22.240]  Go ahead.
[1:13:22.240 --> 1:13:25.240]  Alex, I will say, to be fair, thank you.
[1:13:25.240 --> 1:13:28.240]  I appreciate you keeping me on here.
[1:13:28.240 --> 1:13:29.240]  I do appreciate that.
[1:13:29.240 --> 1:13:35.240]  But I say that like, obviously, Trump wasn't involved in 9-11 per se.
[1:13:35.240 --> 1:13:37.240]  But I mean, this is an addition.
[1:13:37.240 --> 1:13:39.240]  This is the other thing that's really bothered me the last couple of weeks
[1:13:39.240 --> 1:13:43.240]  along with the Rex 84 stuff and along with the guy who was deciphering
[1:13:43.240 --> 1:13:46.240]  the Mark Taylor prophecies that, you know, Trump is like,
[1:13:46.240 --> 1:13:48.240]  God is like controlling Trump.
[1:13:48.240 --> 1:13:51.240]  The other thing that really disturbed me is this whole idea that, you know,
[1:13:51.240 --> 1:13:55.240]  Trump is going to expose 9-11 by exposing Robert Mueller.
[1:13:55.240 --> 1:13:59.240]  I mean, Giuliani's got a much more obvious complicity role in 9-11.
[1:13:59.240 --> 1:14:02.240]  He's Trump's personal attorney and he gets praised on this network.
[1:14:02.240 --> 1:14:04.240]  Are you joking?
[1:14:04.240 --> 1:14:06.240]  Because I studied the whole thing.
[1:14:06.240 --> 1:14:10.240]  Giuliani was the mayor, the feds came in, took control of the whole investigation.
[1:14:10.240 --> 1:14:16.240]  I'm not even defending Giuliani, but Mueller was brought in three days after,
[1:14:16.240 --> 1:14:19.240]  two days after, and was the cover-up artist.
[1:14:19.240 --> 1:14:23.240]  And it blocked the families, blocked congressional investigations, covered it up.
[1:14:23.240 --> 1:14:28.240]  He's recognized as the main architect of the cover-up.
[1:14:28.240 --> 1:14:29.240]  Right.
[1:14:29.240 --> 1:14:31.240]  I mean, Giuliani, no, he didn't do anything wrong.
[1:14:31.240 --> 1:14:32.240]  Did he?
[1:14:32.240 --> 1:14:33.240]  I'm guessing Lou Eisenberg.
[1:14:33.240 --> 1:14:34.240]  Hold on.
[1:14:34.240 --> 1:14:37.240]  Let me just finish because you're saying,
[1:14:37.240 --> 1:14:43.240]  Mueller became the FBI director two days after.
[1:14:43.240 --> 1:14:45.240]  You don't want to talk about Israel.
[1:14:45.240 --> 1:14:49.240]  You don't want to talk about the United States and Saudi Arabia and radical Islam.
[1:14:49.240 --> 1:14:51.240]  You just yelled that so fast.
[1:14:51.240 --> 1:14:52.240]  What'd you say?
[1:14:52.240 --> 1:14:56.240]  I said, you don't want to talk about these things because it implicates Israel.
[1:14:56.240 --> 1:14:58.240]  It doesn't implicate Saudi Arabia.
[1:14:58.240 --> 1:14:59.240]  It doesn't implicate the United States.
[1:14:59.240 --> 1:15:01.240]  It doesn't implicate radical Islam.
[1:15:01.240 --> 1:15:04.240]  I'm glad you called in and I'm glad you got the attention you wanted.
[1:15:04.240 --> 1:15:06.240]  I really wanted to have a real debate with you.
[1:15:06.240 --> 1:15:07.240]  That's why I did it.
[1:15:07.240 --> 1:15:08.240]  It's interesting.
[1:15:08.240 --> 1:15:09.240]  And it wakes me up.
[1:15:09.240 --> 1:15:11.240]  So thanks for calling into the show.
[1:15:11.240 --> 1:15:13.240]  Everybody's better than me.
[1:15:13.240 --> 1:15:15.240]  Everybody says what evil group it is.
[1:15:15.240 --> 1:15:16.240]  It's this group.
[1:15:16.240 --> 1:15:17.240]  It's that group.
[1:15:17.240 --> 1:15:19.240]  And everybody, it's the Catholics.
[1:15:19.240 --> 1:15:20.240]  It's the Jews.
[1:15:20.240 --> 1:15:21.240]  It's this group, that group.
[1:15:21.240 --> 1:15:23.240]  The liberals say it's the white people.
[1:15:23.240 --> 1:15:24.240]  The white people are to blame.
[1:15:24.240 --> 1:15:25.240]  It's evil people.
[1:15:25.240 --> 1:15:26.240]  It's evil people.
[1:15:26.240 --> 1:15:27.240]  It's evil people.
[1:15:27.240 --> 1:15:28.240]  It's evil people.
[1:15:28.240 --> 1:15:29.240]  It's evil people.
[1:15:29.240 --> 1:15:31.240]  It's evil people are to blame.
[1:15:31.240 --> 1:15:33.240]  It's evil people.
[1:15:33.240 --> 1:15:35.240]  And there are corrupt elements in Israel.
[1:15:35.240 --> 1:15:37.240]  There are corrupt elements in China that are in control.
[1:15:37.240 --> 1:15:39.240]  There are corrupt elements running the EU.
[1:15:39.240 --> 1:15:44.240]  But I don't say it's Europeans that are bad because the EU is a bunch of corrupt people.
[1:15:44.240 --> 1:15:57.240]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:15:57.240 --> 1:16:00.240]  Want revenge on the common housefly?
[1:16:00.240 --> 1:16:04.240]  Well, after 10,000 years, someone has finally come up with a better way.
[1:16:04.240 --> 1:16:05.240]  The bug assault.

[1:16:07.240 --> 1:16:10.240]  Which utilizes ordinary table salt as ammunition.
[1:16:10.240 --> 1:16:12.240]  Non-toxic and no batteries required.
[1:16:12.240 --> 1:16:13.240]  So much fun.
[1:16:13.240 --> 1:16:15.240]  You'll forget you have a wife and kids.

[1:17:25.240 --> 1:17:28.240]  You have been lied to.
[1:17:28.240 --> 1:17:30.240]  My name is Kevin Ship.
[1:17:30.240 --> 1:17:33.240]  I'm a former decorated CIA officer.
[1:17:33.240 --> 1:17:38.240]  Finally, someone has come out and written what I think is the best ex-Mose on the shadow government ever.
[1:17:38.240 --> 1:17:44.240]  We're in a constitutional crisis and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government.
[1:17:44.240 --> 1:17:47.240]  We've got to get this out because just because you're awake, folks, doesn't mean other people are.
[1:17:47.240 --> 1:17:50.240]  This is critical to get, to read, to give them a library, to give them a church.

[1:17:58.240 --> 1:18:02.240]  This 4th of July is special. Everybody can see it. They can feel it.
[1:18:02.240 --> 1:18:06.240]  The globalists are attempting to kill a worldwide awakening of their tyranny.
[1:18:06.240 --> 1:18:10.240]  And America, yet again, is at the heart of the resistance, the globalist.
[1:18:10.240 --> 1:18:16.240]  That's why this 4th of July, I'm asking all of our great supporters to think about Info Wars now more than ever.
[1:18:16.240 --> 1:18:20.240]  And what would the world be like if Info Wars wasn't there resisting the globalists?
[1:18:20.240 --> 1:18:23.240]  What would have happened if you hadn't supported Info Wars?
[1:18:23.240 --> 1:18:25.240]  We would not be having the victories we have today.
[1:18:25.240 --> 1:18:28.240]  So yes, a lot of good things are happening, but the enemy is striking back.
[1:18:28.240 --> 1:18:35.240]  So please, think about Info Wars and funding our operation while you get great products at the same time on the 4th of July that's so historic.
[1:18:35.240 --> 1:18:40.240]  We have record sales going on right now, free shipping on hundreds of different items.

[1:18:53.240 --> 1:19:18.240]  This 4th of July is special and our sales are special to match it. InfoWarsStore.com
[1:19:18.240 --> 1:19:24.240]  Prebiotic fiber is soluble fiber that ferments in the gut to help feed good bacteria,
[1:19:24.240 --> 1:19:29.240]  which helps you digest food, absorb nutrients, and even support your immune system.
[1:19:29.240 --> 1:19:36.240]  InfoWarsLife's cutting-edge formula only brings you the highest quality organic and clinically studied ingredients.
[1:19:36.240 --> 1:19:41.240]  Cheap prebiotic fibers are used up only at the beginning of the colon,
[1:19:41.240 --> 1:19:51.240]  but our premium organic acacia fiber is slowly digested by the good bacteria throughout the entire colon for maximum prebiotic effect.
[1:19:51.240 --> 1:20:12.240]  Head to infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[1:20:22.240 --> 1:20:26.240]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:20:26.240 --> 1:20:35.240]  Alright, obviously I can't spend three full segments with each caller like I did the last individual, Greg in Iowa,
[1:20:35.240 --> 1:20:41.240]  who you can hear had palpable hatred for me at the end of the call, because he's the good guy.
[1:20:41.240 --> 1:20:48.240]  He knows it's all Israel. Israel's one monolithic problem. If Israel wasn't there everything would be fine.
[1:20:48.240 --> 1:20:55.240]  And then meanwhile, the very same type of folks say that Israel runs Hollywood and everything else in the US,
[1:20:55.240 --> 1:20:58.240]  well then why is the entire media trying to destroy Trump?
[1:20:58.240 --> 1:21:07.240]  The truth is there's very diverse ideas and groups in Judaism and Orthodox Jews and leftists and Zionists and all of it,
[1:21:07.240 --> 1:21:16.240]  and the truth is Trump is pro-Israel. And I'm not against Israel, but it becomes a football issue where I'm not even thinking about Israel.
[1:21:16.240 --> 1:21:21.240]  It's just one more country. I don't want it blown off the map.
[1:21:21.240 --> 1:21:27.240]  If you turn it over to the Palestinians, they'd be killing each other forever. None of the Arab countries take any of them in.
[1:21:27.240 --> 1:21:34.240]  But that's not an issue. A lot of them are refugees from other countries, but they don't take them in.
[1:21:34.240 --> 1:21:43.240]  Israel's got to take everybody in. Europe's got to take everybody in. The US has to take everybody in or we're Nazis.
[1:21:43.240 --> 1:21:47.240]  And then I'm just sitting and thinking about Israel. They're assassinating their prime ministers.
[1:21:47.240 --> 1:21:54.240]  They're trying to indict Netanyahu, the leftist star, but people think there's like one monolithic thing.
[1:21:54.240 --> 1:22:00.240]  The power structure doesn't like Donald Trump. It's trying to remove him.
[1:22:00.240 --> 1:22:07.240]  No one can deny that. No one could deny that Georgetown Vatican run is suing me trying to shut me off the air.
[1:22:07.240 --> 1:22:11.240]  No one could deny that Soros is funding the Sandy Hook lawsuits.
[1:22:11.240 --> 1:22:17.240]  No one can deny that they're on TV. Hillary Clinton saying she wants me off the air, but it doesn't matter.
[1:22:17.240 --> 1:22:24.240]  See, if you're another talk show host, you just call in and say, you're bad. You're a sellout. You're a fraud.
[1:22:24.240 --> 1:22:30.240]  I'm the real McCoy. You are establishment.
[1:22:30.240 --> 1:22:37.240]  That dog doesn't hunt. That boat doesn't float. That kite don't fly.
[1:22:37.240 --> 1:22:47.240]  I am a pro America constitutionalist free market Christian who believes in human destiny and freedom.
[1:22:47.240 --> 1:22:50.240]  I am not a tribalist.
[1:22:50.240 --> 1:22:56.240]  And I want to transcend all of this garbage and bring humanity together.
[1:22:56.240 --> 1:23:06.240]  But to do that, I have to expose the left is cold bloodedly creating culture war in the name of fighting racism and sexism to make more of it.
[1:23:06.240 --> 1:23:12.240]  To turn us in to basket cases and their own documents and WikiLeaks admit that.
[1:23:12.240 --> 1:23:18.240]  And the the the holier than now anti Israel brigades on the Internet are just that.
[1:23:18.240 --> 1:23:25.240]  I can be talking about cooking recipes and they'll come on my YouTube videos and just say something about Israel all day.
[1:23:25.240 --> 1:23:29.240]  And it's like a dog barking. You ever stayed at somebody's house.
[1:23:29.240 --> 1:23:40.240]  And their neighbors got a dog that barks all night and just and it's like sing a different song sometime man.
[1:23:40.240 --> 1:23:48.240]  I'm worried about flesh eating bacteria. I'm worried about a new super bug mysteriously out that sterilizes women.
[1:23:48.240 --> 1:23:53.240]  I'm worried about end of days type stuff. I'm worried about my children's future.
[1:23:53.240 --> 1:23:56.240]  I'm worried about a nuclear war getting triggered North Korea.
[1:23:56.240 --> 1:24:04.240]  I want peace with Russia. So you got to get it straight. Am I a Russian agent, an Israeli agent, a Vatican agent, a Masonic agent?
[1:24:04.240 --> 1:24:11.240]  No, I'm a pragmatic human agent.
[1:24:11.240 --> 1:24:19.240]  So yeah, let's hear from Hillary real quick. Go ahead. Let's hear from her.
[1:24:19.240 --> 1:24:30.240]  Okay, here's the deal. I'm going to go to all your calls now. I got to get a feature person like two minutes to move on, but but that guy was really throwing out kind of one of the standard deals there.
[1:24:30.240 --> 1:24:35.240]  And he didn't argue the economy's turning around. He didn't argue that most establishments against Trump.
[1:24:35.240 --> 1:24:42.240]  It was just your Achilles heel is you won't talk about Israel won't talk about Israel.
[1:24:42.240 --> 1:24:50.240]  I'm tempted to go to Israel and just wallow in it. Oh, that really triggered folks.
[1:24:50.240 --> 1:25:03.240]  It's like when I saw a bunch of orthodox, acidic Jews out at the Republican inauguration of Trump and they waved me over and I just happily ran over and danced with them.
[1:25:03.240 --> 1:25:09.240]  And boy, the Nazis didn't even anything to say. It's like they always want to say, Jones's wife has a big nose.
[1:25:09.240 --> 1:25:16.240]  So he's married to a Jew and all this other stuff. It's just total mental illness.
[1:25:16.240 --> 1:25:23.240]  Stormfront, all those things. I'm the one that pointed out that my ex-wife's mother's father was Jewish.
[1:25:23.240 --> 1:25:29.240]  So I guess, yeah, I guess you say my kids have some Jewish blood. I'm proud of it. I got some Native American blood. Big deal.
[1:25:29.240 --> 1:25:41.240]  I'm proud of it. But then I see your mental illness. But my new wife's German, 75% German from Omaha, Nebraska, 25% Patty, Irish.
[1:25:41.240 --> 1:25:49.240]  So her Irish mixes a little bit of my Irish. I mean, it's just mental illness, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:25:49.240 --> 1:25:55.240]  But they're all over the place going, Oh, look, she's got a big nose. You know, I like my wife's big nose.
[1:25:55.240 --> 1:26:02.240]  I've explained that. I don't like just one that looked like Barbie dolls. And she's got a very noble, aquiline, beautiful nose.
[1:26:02.240 --> 1:26:11.240]  And she's incredibly gorgeous. And her body's amazing. And great. It makes you feel good to go, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew.
[1:26:11.240 --> 1:26:18.240]  Fine. My wife's Jewish then. Of course, she's not. But if that helps you in your mental illness world, you know, where she's giving me the orders and all this other stuff,
[1:26:18.240 --> 1:26:27.240]  it's bizarre. It's weird. It's a cult. It's stupid.
[1:26:27.240 --> 1:26:32.240]  Since we mentioned it, though, here's the president on local TV saying he thought there were bombs in the buildings.
[1:26:32.240 --> 1:26:37.240]  This is the guy who is, he basically said he was involved in 9-11 cover.
[1:26:37.240 --> 1:26:42.240]  Well, no, I didn't really say that. So here's the guy. Here's the 9-11 cover up artist Donald Trump.
[1:26:42.240 --> 1:26:49.240]  It was an architectural defect. You know, the workplace center was always known as a very, very strong building. Don't forget, that took a big bomb in the basement.
[1:26:49.240 --> 1:26:58.240]  Now, the basement is the most vulnerable place because that's your foundation. And it withstood that. And I got to see that area about three or four days after it took place
[1:26:58.240 --> 1:27:04.240]  because one of my structural engineers actually took me for a tour because he did the building. And I said, I can't believe it.
[1:27:04.240 --> 1:27:08.240]  The building was standing solid and half of the columns were blown out.
[1:27:08.240 --> 1:27:15.240]  So this was an unbelievably powerful building. If you know anything about structure, it was one of the first buildings that was built from the outside.
[1:27:15.240 --> 1:27:22.240]  The steel, the reason the World Trade Center had such narrow windows is that in between all the windows, you had the steel on the outside.
[1:27:22.240 --> 1:27:27.240]  You had the steel on the outside of the building. That's why when I first looked, and you had big, heavy I-beams,
[1:27:27.240 --> 1:27:32.240]  when I first looked at it, I couldn't believe it because there was a hole in the steel.
[1:27:32.240 --> 1:27:40.240]  And this is steel that was, you remember the windows in the World Trade Center, folks. I think, you know, if you were up there, they were quite narrow.
[1:27:40.240 --> 1:27:51.240]  And in between was this heavy steel. I said, how could a plane, even a plane, even a 767 or 747 or whatever it might have been, how could it possibly go through the steel?
[1:27:51.240 --> 1:28:00.240]  I happen to think that they had not only a plane, but they had bombs that exploded almost simultaneously because I just can't imagine anything being able to go through that wall.
[1:28:00.240 --> 1:28:04.240]  Most buildings are built with the steels on the inside around the elevator shaft.
[1:28:04.240 --> 1:28:11.240]  This one was built from the outside, which is the strongest structure you can have, and it was almost just like a can of soup.
[1:28:11.240 --> 1:28:18.240]  You know, Dana, we were looking at pictures, I'm running along of that plane coming into building number two, and when you see that,
[1:28:18.240 --> 1:28:26.240]  approach the far side, and then all of a sudden, within a matter of a millisecond, the explosion pops out the other side.
[1:28:26.240 --> 1:28:34.240]  Right. I just think that there was a plane with more than just fuel. I think, obviously, there were very big planes that were going very rapidly.
[1:28:34.240 --> 1:28:40.240]  There goes President Trump, ladies and gentlemen. Boy, covering up 9-11 on day one. What a piece of crap.
[1:28:40.240 --> 1:28:50.240]  Unbelievable. Unbelievable. But no matter what he ever does, he's nobody.
[1:28:50.240 --> 1:28:57.240]  Anybody on the Internet just says he's Israeli and just makes it all bad because they're the good guys. We're the bad guys.

[1:33:15.240 --> 1:33:40.240]  All right, I gotta go through these callers a lot faster now. I spent 30 minutes or so responding to one of the most common things put up on the left, really,
[1:33:40.240 --> 1:33:48.240]  is that there's a big Jewish conspiracy and a white male conspiracy, and if you can deal with that, you can fix everything.
[1:33:48.240 --> 1:33:55.240]  I mean, you see that in the college campuses now, where they're saying, you know, no Jews allowed. Very bizarre.
[1:33:55.240 --> 1:34:03.240]  And then you see the whole movements out there, no white males allowed or no whites period on certain days of the year at college campuses.
[1:34:03.240 --> 1:34:12.240]  This is the opposite of what Martin Luther King talked about, but people like to arrange themselves into racial and tribal groups.
[1:34:12.240 --> 1:34:22.240]  Well, my tribal groups, Free Market, Americana, Free Market of Ideas, that's what I think unifies people, and that's what works best, and that's what I'm trying to push.
[1:34:22.240 --> 1:34:33.240]  We want to write back to your calls here in a moment. Please remember that the Broadcasters' list are supported, and it's also a great way for you to meet like-minded people when you buy things like t-shirts.
[1:34:33.240 --> 1:34:43.240]  And last week, Walmart pulled off its shelves after boycotts a Impic 45 shirt, and I said, why do that?
[1:34:43.240 --> 1:34:54.240]  I bet Walmart could sell, on the end caps, Re-Elect 45 versus Impic 45. Ours is much better looking, our own design, but it's still a baseball-style shirt.
[1:34:54.240 --> 1:35:01.240]  Ours says Re-Elect 45 with the American flag and infowars.com on the arm, and I am the resistance on the back.
[1:35:01.240 --> 1:35:10.240]  And the shirts are coming in tomorrow. They're made right here in Texas, printed right here in Texas. They're rush delivering them.
[1:35:10.240 --> 1:35:18.240]  They will be here tomorrow. They will be shipping out beginning on Friday. No reviews yet because it's been pre-ordered.
[1:35:18.240 --> 1:35:24.240]  But get your order in to get them first, and I suspected that this would be a bestseller, so we ordered quite a few of them.
[1:35:24.240 --> 1:35:29.240]  It's $19.95, Re-Elect 45.
[1:35:29.240 --> 1:35:40.240]  And they also have Mean Like a Wolverine, which is a great design with Trump with mutton chops like the Wolverine, and it's just a great iconic image.
[1:35:40.240 --> 1:35:48.240]  You want to meet like-minded people? You want to spread the word? You want to exercise free speech? InfowarsStore.com.

[1:36:04.240 --> 1:36:13.240]  Now, again, later I'm going to open the phones up after I take this raft of polls for people that agree with Trump or, you know, are appreciative.
[1:36:13.240 --> 1:36:17.240]  Because we're pretty much getting instant gratification. It's almost surreal.
[1:36:17.240 --> 1:36:23.240]  And comparing Trump to Hillary, there's no comparison. I mean, the list of accomplishments is just stunning.
[1:36:23.240 --> 1:36:31.240]  I'm just stunned by it, but I thought we'd hear from people that think that's wrong.
[1:36:31.240 --> 1:36:36.240]  And I see some calls here that bring up some pretty salient issues that I do have issues with Trump, like Jenny.
[1:36:36.240 --> 1:36:42.240]  James says, Alex flipped on Rex 84. It's a slippery slope, former cop.
[1:36:42.240 --> 1:36:48.240]  It's a little more nuanced than that. It's not like people found some secret thing I said. I said it on air.
[1:36:48.240 --> 1:36:53.240]  So I see these clips. Look what we got. We got him here. We found this.
[1:36:53.240 --> 1:36:59.240]  I actually went and read Rex 84. They've be classified all of it now, not just part of it.
[1:36:59.240 --> 1:37:06.240]  It was the Democrats in Congress saying, look, Ronald Reagan wants to put all the liberals in FEMA camps.
[1:37:06.240 --> 1:37:13.240]  And indeed, I found that there were emergency systems and the Democrats were mainly planning the roundup of conservatives, libertarians.
[1:37:13.240 --> 1:37:19.240]  It was admitted by Clinton and then by Obama. I mean, that was mainstream news. The media demonized me.
[1:37:19.240 --> 1:37:24.240]  But they would always focus on Rex 84.
[1:37:24.240 --> 1:37:31.240]  And then Rex 84 was if 20 million people came from Latin America collapsing the Southwest, how would you keep it from going into anarchy?
[1:37:31.240 --> 1:37:36.240]  And you would put people at military bases until they could be processed or flown back.
[1:37:36.240 --> 1:37:40.240]  And because they learned the U.N. was already planning this to do to the E.U.
[1:37:40.240 --> 1:37:47.240]  It took them decades to do it, but now they've done it with Muslims. So I was going, wow!
[1:37:47.240 --> 1:37:55.240]  I wonder if Reagan was ever briefed on that because they claimed he didn't know about it and that it was all the military that came up with the idea.
[1:37:55.240 --> 1:38:01.240]  But then I saw Trump openly saying, have the military prepared at least three military bases because these numbers are exponential.
[1:38:01.240 --> 1:38:07.240]  The U.N. sending them in. Soros is sending them in to collapse us. The Democrats are trying to have insurrection.
[1:38:07.240 --> 1:38:13.240]  They're trying to have riots over this. What are we going to do?
[1:38:13.240 --> 1:38:18.240]  And so I said, were they right about Rex 84? Because Trump is implementing Rex 84 to an extent.
[1:38:18.240 --> 1:38:22.240]  And he's not purposely separating people, unless he has to. They're treating him very well.
[1:38:22.240 --> 1:38:27.240]  The media is calling it concentration camps. Did we all fall for that propaganda back in the 80s?
[1:38:27.240 --> 1:38:34.240]  And I think that's a debate we can have. So let's go to Johnny and Dallas and I'll go to everybody else.
[1:38:34.240 --> 1:38:42.240]  And then we'll go to James and Ohio saying Alex flipped on Rex 84. But Johnny and Dallas, go ahead.
[1:38:42.240 --> 1:38:57.240]  Oh, hey. Video games. The thing is, you think video games cause violence? Like if you say that, you might as well say that GTA causes people to kill cops or something like that.
[1:38:57.240 --> 1:39:00.240]  No, it doesn't.
[1:39:00.240 --> 1:39:14.240]  Well, you know, I never said video games make people kill people. I said people that are autistic in an Asperger's type spectrum generally, who are also on serotonry uptake inhibitors,
[1:39:14.240 --> 1:39:25.240]  and who usually come from broken homes or foster care. It's been almost every major shooter who tend to be white males who also feel like they are outcast
[1:39:25.240 --> 1:39:36.240]  and are in the involuntarily celibate movement fit the fingerprint constellation.
[1:39:36.240 --> 1:39:47.240]  Pretty much every case from Harrison Clybold right through to the latest and that the video games that were developed by the military to create instinctive shooting,
[1:39:47.240 --> 1:39:55.240]  because up close they found in Vietnam about half the troops wouldn't kill somebody up close because, you know, they had a compulsion not to kill.
[1:39:55.240 --> 1:40:02.240]  And so they would try to do training to make you instinctively kill. And so video games were first developed for instinctive killing.
[1:40:02.240 --> 1:40:12.240]  And so I was saying that you add that to someone who's already mentally ill and who is on a serotonry uptake inhibitor and who is generally into Satanism.
[1:40:12.240 --> 1:40:19.240]  That's another thing they're always into. Then that's what unlocks them and programs them.
[1:40:19.240 --> 1:40:24.240]  So the average person, no, it doesn't habitualize them to go out and carry out violence.
[1:40:24.240 --> 1:40:32.240]  But in all the major studies, it's absolutely correlated to the type of personality that then takes you to the real level.
[1:40:32.240 --> 1:40:41.240]  I mean, does that give you an idea of what I'm saying? Like maybe you drive a race car game and you're 14, but finally you get a driver's license and do it for real?
[1:40:41.240 --> 1:40:48.240]  Yeah, but a lot of studies have said that video games actually don't have anything to do with violence.
[1:40:48.240 --> 1:40:57.240]  Well, the video game companies have financed some of those, but every time I talk about this, people say, Alex, don't censor video games.
[1:40:57.240 --> 1:41:08.240]  I never called for that. I have my free speech to point out that in every mass shooter event at a school, they were obsessed with shoot-em-up video games on record.
[1:41:08.240 --> 1:41:15.240]  That is a fact. It is a fact the games were developed to habitualize instinctive killing.
[1:41:15.240 --> 1:41:18.240]  Are you debating that with me?
[1:41:18.240 --> 1:41:27.240]  Actually, yeah. And also, why don't you talk to Millie about this? I mean, if she was in Hollywood, she would probably have her opinions about that.
[1:41:27.240 --> 1:41:29.240]  Talk to who?
[1:41:29.240 --> 1:41:31.240]  Millie?
[1:41:31.240 --> 1:41:35.240]  Millie Weaver, sure. I'll ask her about that. God bless you, brother. I appreciate your call. All right.
[1:41:35.240 --> 1:41:40.240]  I'll go quicker now. James, when we come back, then Jenny, Richard, Larry, Randy, Jason, everybody.
[1:41:40.240 --> 1:41:44.240]  And we're going to get to you. Now I'm going to open the phones up for just people to agree, disagree, whatever.
[1:41:44.240 --> 1:41:48.240]  You know, the next time. Take a lot of calls. They have a ton of news, a ton of clips, a lot of stuff to cover.
[1:41:48.240 --> 1:41:53.240]  But I wanted to hear from folks who are upset with me or Trump.
[1:41:53.240 --> 1:41:56.240]  I was really saying who think I'm wrong about supporting Trump.
[1:41:56.240 --> 1:42:00.240]  It's kind of devolved into video games and things like that, but that's an interesting topic.
[1:42:00.240 --> 1:42:03.240]  So I was certainly happy to entertain that.
[1:42:03.240 --> 1:42:11.240]  I have done the big rollout yet, but we have it on the Android and on the iPhone.
[1:42:11.240 --> 1:42:16.240]  It is a top rate free app. It's much better than the last app we had.

[1:43:01.240 --> 1:43:06.240]  The globalists are attempting to kill a worldwide awakening to their tyranny.
[1:43:06.240 --> 1:43:10.240]  And America, yet again, is at the heart of the resistance, the globalist.
[1:43:10.240 --> 1:43:15.240]  That's why this 4th of July, I'm asking all of our great supporters to think about infowars now more than ever.
[1:43:15.240 --> 1:43:19.240]  And what would the world be like if infowars wasn't there resisting the globalist?
[1:43:19.240 --> 1:43:22.240]  What would have happened if you hadn't supported infowars?
[1:43:22.240 --> 1:43:24.240]  We would not be having the victories we have today.
[1:43:24.240 --> 1:43:27.240]  So yes, a lot of good things are happening, but the enemy is striking back.
[1:43:27.240 --> 1:43:34.240]  So please, think about infowars and funding our operation while you get great products at the same time on the 4th of July that's so historic.

[1:44:30.240 --> 1:44:37.240]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter, and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure,
[1:44:37.240 --> 1:44:41.240]  but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[1:44:41.240 --> 1:44:46.240]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water.
[1:44:46.240 --> 1:44:52.240]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[1:44:52.240 --> 1:44:58.240]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.

[1:46:54.240 --> 1:47:09.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:47:09.240 --> 1:47:18.240]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:47:18.240 --> 1:47:25.240]  Well, coming up, Trump's going to be meeting with Putin. We're going to have live coverage of that. He's in Europe another seven, eight days.
[1:47:25.240 --> 1:47:31.240]  The whole NATO summit is taking place. He goes over and he says, the US contributes half of the money.
[1:47:31.240 --> 1:47:41.240]  And you guys are buying 70% of your fuel from Russia and not even buying any of it from us.
[1:47:41.240 --> 1:47:54.240]  It's incredible that you just think we're here to be basically pissed on. But then I just saw this live shot a few minutes ago on Fox News of a woman floating around with 100 balloons in the air out of a cartoon.
[1:47:54.240 --> 1:48:07.240]  So from cartoons to reality of your TV viewer, you can see the real circus going on there with the EU and NATO and the unelected bureaucracy that squeezes the taxpayers of Europe.
[1:48:07.240 --> 1:48:12.240]  And that is trying to quarterback an Islamic invasion into the nation.
[1:48:12.240 --> 1:48:18.240]  And look, I'm just very, very glad that Trump is not some of the best economic numbers of the century.
[1:48:18.240 --> 1:48:25.240]  I mean, the last century in and is just doing such a good job for the country on so many fronts. I'm just very, very thankful.
[1:48:25.240 --> 1:48:38.240]  But some listeners are angry. In fact, I see a group of callers says Trump is hypocritical hiring foreign workers. Hillary supporter country could do better with her.
[1:48:38.240 --> 1:48:42.240]  Jay, how can Alex stand behind Trump separating families?
[1:48:42.240 --> 1:48:48.240]  I mean, these are all just nonsensical if you know the facts, but I'm going to. So please stay there.
[1:48:48.240 --> 1:48:55.240]  But James in Ohio says I flipped on Rex 84. Now, again, that was a plan.
[1:48:55.240 --> 1:49:07.240]  If Latin America collapsed or had a communist revolution and tens of millions of people between 20 and 40 million, they estimated came in with the left and the weathermen orchestrating it, which was an actual plan.
[1:49:07.240 --> 1:49:14.240]  They would have to house these people or civilization would break down. The left got it in Congress said it was a plan to put people in concentration camps.
[1:49:14.240 --> 1:49:20.240]  Let me say Trump's putting people in concentration camps. No, they're not concentration camps for your work to death. It starts death.
[1:49:20.240 --> 1:49:27.240]  These are thousands of people coming across men, women, children. They're processing them. They're deporting some, keeping others.
[1:49:27.240 --> 1:49:35.240]  Then that Ellis Island was a death camp because they held you there one month, six months in quarantine and individual cells.
[1:49:35.240 --> 1:49:42.240]  So it's just not reality. So I was saying was I buying into all that leftist propaganda. There were real FEMA camp programs.
[1:49:42.240 --> 1:49:53.240]  That was all under the Clintons, Bush some and of course Obama. We got the documents on that plans to reeducate Americans with the word reeducate given to the army.
[1:49:53.240 --> 1:50:04.240]  It was real. So I pioneered exposing that stuff. But in hindsight, I'm going the left actually tried to set all that up.
[1:50:04.240 --> 1:50:10.240]  Look at the universities are like reeducation camps. Look at other bullies. Look how they hate free speech.
[1:50:10.240 --> 1:50:21.240]  So I'm saying is Trump implementing Rex 84 opening two bases to hold the new giant influx and they're going to call those concentration camps.
[1:50:21.240 --> 1:50:25.240]  So I'm trying to decipher things here. What do you think James in Ohio?
[1:50:25.240 --> 1:50:32.240]  All right, Alex, just a little background real quick. I was in the army and a Marine Corps military policeman and both in a federal cop.
[1:50:32.240 --> 1:50:42.240]  I'm now 50 and I've been contracting since 2005 in Iraq and Afghanistan. My qualm is I like you. I like I support you.
[1:50:42.240 --> 1:50:50.240]  I even buy your product, supermail vitality and other items. And I will continue to do that. But gentlemen can disagree without being disagreeable.
[1:50:50.240 --> 1:51:02.240]  My only issue with it is just like with Harry Reid when he made the nuclear option under Obama for the different things going through the Senate.
[1:51:02.240 --> 1:51:10.240]  They didn't see how the Republicans could flip back on them with it. My worry is it would make it far easier.
[1:51:10.240 --> 1:51:22.240]  Look, when I was a federal cop, we had targets of kids and you covered this and old women and stuff, you know, grandmothers and women that were pregnant.
[1:51:22.240 --> 1:51:28.240]  And they and we had to engage those targets, right? There's a reason for that. And they were American people.
[1:51:28.240 --> 1:51:38.240]  So the slippery slope that I talked about is just it would make it so much easier if they're normalizing this and they're trying to they can justify and say,
[1:51:38.240 --> 1:51:42.240]  look what Trump did. Look what Trump did. We're just doing the same thing except it's to be.
[1:51:42.240 --> 1:51:48.240]  No, I get it because they're calling it camps, even though it's really just shelters, secured shelters.
[1:51:48.240 --> 1:51:58.240]  You're just saying it. I agree with you that this is just a general normalization is why the left wanted to create the crisis to actually bring us into real martial law.
[1:51:58.240 --> 1:52:07.240]  Reagan was looking at emergency response to stop it from happening. And I was just learning with perspective now because the left is running the same operation in Europe and here.
[1:52:07.240 --> 1:52:15.240]  Yes. And the other thing that I would say, and it's just my point of view, you were the first one that covered the fusion centers.
[1:52:15.240 --> 1:52:24.240]  These things are real. And you've also covered like the different topics that I know of from the Gulf War that I can't really get into right now.
[1:52:24.240 --> 1:52:34.240]  But I'm just telling you that I've I've I've seen what Civil War looks like. I've seen the destabilizations of nations and I've tried to even restabilize.
[1:52:34.240 --> 1:52:39.240]  And I and I just worry that that is what they're intending for America, brother.
[1:52:39.240 --> 1:52:44.240]  I totally agree. But just to be clear, the globalists, the Democrats, from what you're seeing, they're trying to destabilization.
[1:52:44.240 --> 1:52:47.240]  I see Trump clearly engaged in a stabilization.
[1:52:47.240 --> 1:52:55.240]  Yes, exactly. No, you're exactly correct. But I'm saying if a Democrat, God forbid, a globalist, it doesn't even have to be a Democrat.
[1:52:55.240 --> 1:52:57.240]  Let's say a Romney gets in.
[1:52:57.240 --> 1:53:04.240]  No, I get it. Trump normalizes these emergency centers because because Latin America is collapsing. What are we supposed to do?
[1:53:04.240 --> 1:53:07.240]  They can then grab the infrastructure and use it.
[1:53:07.240 --> 1:53:14.240]  Yes, exactly. Except they flipped it on up. The Patriots, the Americans.
[1:53:14.240 --> 1:53:15.240]  I get it. One thing.
[1:53:15.240 --> 1:53:21.240]  I mean, every white speech, even now, everybody's a Nazi.
[1:53:21.240 --> 1:53:22.240]  Oh, there's no doubt.
[1:53:22.240 --> 1:53:28.240]  In fact, did you see where the TSA just got immunity to do whatever they want to us?
[1:53:28.240 --> 1:53:34.240]  And that's now becoming this new little national processing force for emergencies and for disasters.
[1:53:34.240 --> 1:53:40.240]  And so they're creating this new bureaucracy.
[1:53:40.240 --> 1:53:44.240]  It's all very, very dangerous. Really, really good points. Thank you, James.
[1:53:44.240 --> 1:53:49.240]  All right. God bless, Alex. Have a great week coming up as well.
[1:53:49.240 --> 1:53:53.240]  See, now that's a smart caller from every angle. The point is they're trying to destabilize the country.
[1:53:53.240 --> 1:53:55.240]  They're trying to cause a race war.
[1:53:55.240 --> 1:53:58.240]  They're trying to collapse the borders. What is Trump supposed to do?
[1:53:58.240 --> 1:54:03.240]  I'm not endorsing martial law. I'm not endorsing the Democrat version of Rex 84.
[1:54:03.240 --> 1:54:06.240]  I'm saying, what are we supposed to do?
[1:54:06.240 --> 1:54:12.240]  Because they're going to call if they start collapsing stuff, Trump's response, martial law.
[1:54:12.240 --> 1:54:15.240]  But clearly, they're the globalist outside force doing it.
[1:54:15.240 --> 1:54:17.240]  All right, let's go to a bunch of these calls now.
[1:54:17.240 --> 1:54:20.240]  Jay, how can Alex stand behind Trump separating families?
[1:54:20.240 --> 1:54:25.240]  Obama did it. It goes back to Eisenhower. The current law goes back to Bush.
[1:54:25.240 --> 1:54:29.240]  That's how, I mean, it's only a few hundred every month or so.
[1:54:29.240 --> 1:54:31.240]  They don't even know who their parents really are.
[1:54:31.240 --> 1:54:33.240]  A lot of them have their parents killed.
[1:54:33.240 --> 1:54:37.240]  A lot of them got given by Obama to child sex traffickers.
[1:54:37.240 --> 1:54:39.240]  I mean, how do I stand behind that?
[1:54:39.240 --> 1:54:45.240]  How are you when you don't know who people are supposed to leave kids in with adults overnight
[1:54:45.240 --> 1:54:47.240]  when you just picked them up in the middle of the desert?
[1:54:47.240 --> 1:54:50.240]  I mean, what are you saying, Jay?
[1:54:50.240 --> 1:54:53.240]  Hey, I'm sure you're going to end up getting upset with me,
[1:54:53.240 --> 1:54:59.240]  but I just want to let you know you, your family, your staff, along with President Trump,
[1:54:59.240 --> 1:55:03.240]  Steve Cuell and a handful others that I really like a lot.
[1:55:03.240 --> 1:55:05.240]  You guys are in my prayer every day.
[1:55:05.240 --> 1:55:06.240]  Thank you.
[1:55:06.240 --> 1:55:08.240]  They never miss a prayer with you guys in it.
[1:55:08.240 --> 1:55:10.240]  It takes me forever to get through to you.
[1:55:10.240 --> 1:55:13.240]  I can never talk to you before, so it's the only way I can do it.
[1:55:13.240 --> 1:55:15.240]  I have nothing to do with it.
[1:55:15.240 --> 1:55:17.240]  I don't disagree with you or anything.
[1:55:17.240 --> 1:55:19.240]  But I love you.
[1:55:19.240 --> 1:55:20.240]  Stay real.
[1:55:20.240 --> 1:55:21.240]  Talk to you later.
[1:55:21.240 --> 1:55:22.240]  God bless, brother.
[1:55:22.240 --> 1:55:26.240]  Okay, so that's the classic thing to get in and say I disagree.
[1:55:26.240 --> 1:55:30.240]  Randy, Trump is hypocritical, hiring foreign workers.
[1:55:30.240 --> 1:55:31.240]  We'll go to Randy in a minute.
[1:55:31.240 --> 1:55:32.240]  Let's go to Jason first, though.
[1:55:32.240 --> 1:55:36.240]  Hillary supporter, country would be better with her.
[1:55:36.240 --> 1:55:37.240]  Explain that to me.
[1:55:37.240 --> 1:55:39.240]  Thanks for calling.
[1:55:39.240 --> 1:55:43.240]  So what's more evil?
[1:55:43.240 --> 1:55:50.240]  A pedophile or you, somebody who's admitted to killing 10 of his own children?
[1:55:50.240 --> 1:55:51.240]  Well, I repented.
[1:55:51.240 --> 1:55:52.240]  I repented of being involved.
[1:55:52.240 --> 1:55:54.240]  I repented of being involved in abortion.
[1:55:54.240 --> 1:55:58.240]  And I said it on air because I'm ashamed of it and I'm not going to hide things.
[1:55:58.240 --> 1:56:02.240]  And how many kids would you have to kill before you were as bad as a pedophile?
[1:56:02.240 --> 1:56:07.240]  A pedophile wants to go out and suck the life force out of a child and is satanic.
[1:56:07.240 --> 1:56:10.240]  Most of the times I learned girlfriends had abortions later.
[1:56:10.240 --> 1:56:13.240]  A few times I was like, okay, whatever.
[1:56:13.240 --> 1:56:17.240]  But after I was about 18, that never happened again.
[1:56:17.240 --> 1:56:20.240]  And the next time I got a woman pregnant, I got married to her.
[1:56:20.240 --> 1:56:23.240]  And for years, I repented and didn't even date and I was celibate.
[1:56:23.240 --> 1:56:26.240]  For a couple of years, I was very upset about it.
[1:56:26.240 --> 1:56:28.240]  God convicted my heart of it.
[1:56:28.240 --> 1:56:31.240]  That's why I've told the story is because it was wrong.
[1:56:31.240 --> 1:56:37.240]  Yeah, so how many of those kids were from black women?
[1:56:37.240 --> 1:56:40.240]  None.
[1:56:40.240 --> 1:56:41.240]  Really?
[1:56:41.240 --> 1:56:45.240]  And so just, I just want to make it very clear because I always hear you talking about morality.
[1:56:45.240 --> 1:56:49.240]  And it's strange because I've never had an abortion.
[1:56:49.240 --> 1:56:53.240]  But if I did, I'd imagine it being something very serious.
[1:56:53.240 --> 1:56:55.240]  You've paid for 10.
[1:56:55.240 --> 1:56:57.240]  No, I didn't say that.
[1:56:57.240 --> 1:57:01.240]  I mean, I learned about it a lot of times later.
[1:57:01.240 --> 1:57:03.240]  Because you know, the girlfriend will break up with you.
[1:57:03.240 --> 1:57:04.240]  They usually get mad after they do it.
[1:57:04.240 --> 1:57:07.240]  And then later you find out or you go around their parents or whatever.
[1:57:07.240 --> 1:57:09.240]  That's when I was a teenager and they'd be pissed at me.
[1:57:09.240 --> 1:57:11.240]  And I'd let her learn about it.
[1:57:11.240 --> 1:57:13.240]  And then, look, here's the deal.
[1:57:13.240 --> 1:57:15.240]  I think you're confusing morality.
[1:57:15.240 --> 1:57:19.240]  When you're young and stupid and things happen, later you realize it's wrong.
[1:57:19.240 --> 1:57:23.240]  You repent like the thief on the cross and the murderer on the cross.
[1:57:23.240 --> 1:57:25.240]  And one gets it, one doesn't.
[1:57:25.240 --> 1:57:28.240]  You're the president of the United States.
[1:57:28.240 --> 1:57:31.240]  Yeah, who's the president, Alexa?
[1:57:33.240 --> 1:57:35.240]  We'll be right back, Randy. Stay there.
[1:57:39.240 --> 1:57:44.240]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:57:47.240 --> 1:57:51.240]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[1:57:51.240 --> 1:57:56.240]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[1:57:56.240 --> 1:57:57.240]  to detoxify the body.
[1:57:57.240 --> 1:57:59.240]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield.
[1:57:59.240 --> 1:58:02.240]  Toxic, metal, and chemical defense support.
[1:58:02.240 --> 1:58:03.240]  It's made in the USA.
[1:58:03.240 --> 1:58:09.240]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body
[1:58:09.240 --> 1:58:10.240]  and it supports the N4.
[1:58:10.240 --> 1:58:12.240]  It is a classical 360 win.
[1:58:12.240 --> 1:58:16.240]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[1:58:16.240 --> 1:58:22.240]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[1:58:22.240 --> 1:58:27.240]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[1:58:27.240 --> 1:58:32.240]  that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be
[1:58:32.240 --> 1:58:37.240]  because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the next level

[2:00:14.240 --> 2:00:18.240]  You know, the Austin-American statesman, if you please go, had an article out
[2:00:18.240 --> 2:00:23.240]  after I confronted Bernie Sanders at the LAX airport just asked a few questions and he ran away.
[2:00:23.240 --> 2:00:29.240]  And the writer, Jonathan Tillove said, you know, this is like a caricature of Jones
[2:00:29.240 --> 2:00:32.240]  and some of it doesn't make Jones look too good.
[2:00:32.240 --> 2:00:37.240]  You wonder why Jones didn't edit out the parts where people got in his face and got some zingers in.
[2:00:37.240 --> 2:00:42.240]  Because Jonathan Tillove, it was about showing what really happened.
[2:00:42.240 --> 2:00:46.240]  From the different camera angles, we had two different phones taping.
[2:00:46.240 --> 2:00:51.240]  And it was about engaging him, even if I didn't get all my questions in
[2:00:51.240 --> 2:00:55.240]  and even if some of his minions jumped in and got in my face.
[2:00:55.240 --> 2:00:57.240]  See, it's about reality.
[2:00:57.240 --> 2:01:02.240]  And so when I told the story of in life learning that girlfriends had abortions,
[2:01:02.240 --> 2:01:04.240]  I wasn't trying to get them pregnant.
[2:01:04.240 --> 2:01:08.240]  Let's just say, you know, my shooting blanks here.
[2:01:08.240 --> 2:01:15.240]  I got four children that my dad, when I was like 18, said, man, for 19, he goes,
[2:01:15.240 --> 2:01:17.240]  he goes, this is evil.
[2:01:17.240 --> 2:01:20.240]  And he goes, he said, I feel like you're killing my grandchildren
[2:01:20.240 --> 2:01:24.240]  when I actually found out about one and halfway condoned it.
[2:01:24.240 --> 2:01:27.240]  So for a couple of years, has that always been a Christian?
[2:01:27.240 --> 2:01:31.240]  But I realized how evil it was, even if I wasn't actively involved in it.
[2:01:31.240 --> 2:01:37.240]  It was part of my mission of getting really serious and I stopped even drinking a beer with friends.
[2:01:37.240 --> 2:01:39.240]  I started going to church again.
[2:01:39.240 --> 2:01:40.240]  I really felt guilty for it.
[2:01:40.240 --> 2:01:47.240]  So I tell the story on air because it's what happened and I'm ashamed of it.
[2:01:47.240 --> 2:01:49.240]  But I tell it because I'm real.
[2:01:49.240 --> 2:01:52.240]  And the left can't ever get that because they're such liars.
[2:01:52.240 --> 2:01:54.240]  The left is celebrating abortion.
[2:01:54.240 --> 2:01:58.240]  I played a video earlier with him all over the news, all over TV, how great it is,
[2:01:58.240 --> 2:02:00.240]  how sexy it is, how much fun it is.
[2:02:00.240 --> 2:02:03.240]  They've got women saying it's enjoyable to do.
[2:02:03.240 --> 2:02:08.240]  They say it's a satanic ritual, they love killing their kids.
[2:02:08.240 --> 2:02:12.240]  I believe the propaganda, even though I wasn't tacitly involved.
[2:02:12.240 --> 2:02:14.240]  And when I really thought about it, I realized it was evil.
[2:02:14.240 --> 2:02:16.240]  So I've gone out and demonstrated against it.
[2:02:16.240 --> 2:02:20.240]  I've given money to charities that try to get women to actually have their babies and not abort them.
[2:02:20.240 --> 2:02:25.240]  But I already know I've repented and I'm good with God on that.
[2:02:25.240 --> 2:02:29.240]  But I'll tell you at a certain guilt level, I don't have any fear of being tortured or killed or anything
[2:02:29.240 --> 2:02:32.240]  because you know what, I got it coming.
[2:02:32.240 --> 2:02:34.240]  So don't worry.
[2:02:34.240 --> 2:02:37.240]  When you call them, oh, I've never had one or been involved in one.
[2:02:37.240 --> 2:02:40.240]  The boy would be serious, I wouldn't.
[2:02:40.240 --> 2:02:42.240]  Don't worry, I know I've done bad things.
[2:02:42.240 --> 2:02:47.240]  Don't you worry one little bit about that.
[2:02:47.240 --> 2:02:50.240]  So that's the whole point of telling the story on here.
[2:02:50.240 --> 2:02:56.240]  Tell people I'm a bad person, but that I've become better and repented
[2:02:56.240 --> 2:02:59.240]  and now I'm trying to do a lot of good to change for that fact.
[2:02:59.240 --> 2:03:03.240]  But that isn't the answer in totality.
[2:03:03.240 --> 2:03:07.240]  Faithfully, that works as dead as true, but it's saved by grace.
[2:03:07.240 --> 2:03:08.240]  That's totally true.
[2:03:08.240 --> 2:03:10.240]  God knows when your heart's real.
[2:03:10.240 --> 2:03:11.240]  You don't do it again.
[2:03:11.240 --> 2:03:13.240]  You change it and then you live and try to be a better person.
[2:03:13.240 --> 2:03:20.240]  I tell the story of being involved in abortion for this key reason, though.
[2:03:20.240 --> 2:03:28.240]  The other areas are side issues, more of a form of masochism for guilt.
[2:03:28.240 --> 2:03:32.240]  The real reason I do it is when they get men and women involved in it,
[2:03:32.240 --> 2:03:36.240]  it hurts their soul so much that then they get so guilty,
[2:03:36.240 --> 2:03:40.240]  the left uses it to manipulate them into loving it and defending it
[2:03:40.240 --> 2:03:44.240]  to be a blood sacrifice to complete their journey into darkness
[2:03:44.240 --> 2:03:46.240]  to where they're on TV celebrating, and I love it.
[2:03:46.240 --> 2:03:47.240]  It's good.
[2:03:47.240 --> 2:03:48.240]  Kill the babies.
[2:03:48.240 --> 2:03:49.240]  Take them out.
[2:03:49.240 --> 2:03:50.240]  Get them.
[2:03:50.240 --> 2:03:51.240]  Kick their ass.
[2:03:51.240 --> 2:03:52.240]  Little bastards.
[2:03:52.240 --> 2:03:53.240]  We played the video earlier.
[2:03:53.240 --> 2:03:56.240]  And Gloria Steinem pushes that, blaspheming with Jesus.
[2:03:56.240 --> 2:03:59.240]  So that women know it's wrong.
[2:03:59.240 --> 2:04:04.240]  It doubles their chances of all different types of reproductive cancers
[2:04:04.240 --> 2:04:06.240]  in the uterus, in the ovaries, in the cervix.
[2:04:06.240 --> 2:04:07.240]  Look up the statistics.
[2:04:07.240 --> 2:04:13.240]  One abortion doubles your chances of cancers in all those areas.
[2:04:13.240 --> 2:04:15.240]  It is absolutely unnatural.
[2:04:15.240 --> 2:04:17.240]  Your body's connected in, hooked in.
[2:04:17.240 --> 2:04:18.240]  It's not supposed to happen.
[2:04:18.240 --> 2:04:19.240]  A miscarriage?
[2:04:19.240 --> 2:04:20.240]  Things like that?
[2:04:20.240 --> 2:04:21.240]  That's God.
[2:04:21.240 --> 2:04:22.240]  That's the body.
[2:04:22.240 --> 2:04:23.240]  That's meant to happen.
[2:04:23.240 --> 2:04:24.240]  We'll be right back.
[2:04:24.240 --> 2:04:27.240]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen, but I want women to understand
[2:04:27.240 --> 2:04:30.240]  that they can always repent and not be part of the evil
[2:04:30.240 --> 2:04:32.240]  and God will forgive them right now.
[2:04:32.240 --> 2:04:36.240]  To the president of the United States.
[2:04:36.240 --> 2:04:38.240]  The U.S. president is Don Trump.
[2:04:38.240 --> 2:04:39.240]  Yeah!
[2:04:39.240 --> 2:04:52.240]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[2:04:52.240 --> 2:05:00.240]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[2:05:00.240 --> 2:05:03.240]  The real drama can be found here in Lailania, states.
[2:05:03.240 --> 2:05:06.240]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater,
[2:05:06.240 --> 2:05:10.240]  and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[2:05:10.240 --> 2:05:13.240]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles,
[2:05:13.240 --> 2:05:17.240]  and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[2:05:17.240 --> 2:05:23.240]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[2:05:23.240 --> 2:05:26.240]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels
[2:05:26.240 --> 2:05:29.240]  of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[2:05:29.240 --> 2:05:33.240]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter,
[2:05:33.240 --> 2:05:36.240]  and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure,
[2:05:36.240 --> 2:05:40.240]  but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[2:05:40.240 --> 2:05:45.240]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water.
[2:05:45.240 --> 2:05:51.240]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[2:05:51.240 --> 2:06:17.240]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[2:06:21.240 --> 2:06:25.240]  All right, I've got five or six more calls of people that disagree with me and Trump,
[2:06:25.240 --> 2:06:27.240]  and I'm opening the phones up to everybody.
[2:06:27.240 --> 2:06:35.240]  The toll-free number is 877-789-ALAX, 877-789-ALEX.
[2:06:35.240 --> 2:06:41.240]  Of course, it's next Monday that the president is going to have his official meeting with
[2:06:41.240 --> 2:06:44.240]  Vladimir Putin.
[2:06:44.240 --> 2:06:49.240]  Chuck E. Schumer always weighing in as the defender of America when he is a globalist,
[2:06:49.240 --> 2:06:54.240]  says, you should not meet with him alone, and you can have no confirmation of judges
[2:06:54.240 --> 2:07:01.240]  because you're under investigation, totally made up, not in law, never been done.
[2:07:01.240 --> 2:07:05.240]  But they're intending to try to block this nomination.
[2:07:05.240 --> 2:07:10.240]  They're intending to pull some really big tricks to try to stop Trump.
[2:07:10.240 --> 2:07:13.240]  That includes flying a jumbo jet into wherever he's at.
[2:07:13.240 --> 2:07:16.240]  I'm telling you, the globalists are out to get him.
[2:07:16.240 --> 2:07:22.240]  You can feel it, you can see it, it's on.
[2:07:22.240 --> 2:07:26.240]  And I don't think the callers have proven the case that Trump isn't good.
[2:07:26.240 --> 2:07:30.240]  And I don't think the callers have proven the case that Trump sold anybody out.
[2:07:30.240 --> 2:07:34.240]  I don't think the callers have proven the case that I'm wrong to be so enthusiastic.
[2:07:34.240 --> 2:07:42.240]  This is like night and day, and the whole power structure and all the political money is against him.
[2:07:42.240 --> 2:07:48.240]  I just feel like we ought to be thinking our lucky stars, thinking God.
[2:07:48.240 --> 2:07:52.240]  Now that said,
[2:07:52.240 --> 2:07:56.240]  Jenny has the key issue.
[2:07:56.240 --> 2:07:59.240]  And that is Trump is not taking care of vaccine issue.
[2:07:59.240 --> 2:08:01.240]  He's trying to get drug prices down.
[2:08:01.240 --> 2:08:05.240]  He's trying to get a lot of the life extension technologies and medical treatments released.
[2:08:05.240 --> 2:08:11.240]  He's doing that, but I know for a fact that Baron and Trump does not like this being talked about.
[2:08:11.240 --> 2:08:17.240]  In fact, I've been told not by Trump or his people, but by folks close to like, just don't go there.
[2:08:17.240 --> 2:08:20.240]  But Baron was doing great.
[2:08:20.240 --> 2:08:25.240]  Got a third round of shots when he was two and man, it hurt him bad.
[2:08:25.240 --> 2:08:31.240]  And I've got articles here today that vaccine damage.
[2:08:31.240 --> 2:08:39.240]  Autism is up globally 1000% in the last 100 years.
[2:08:39.240 --> 2:08:43.240]  1000%. Well, it's more than that though. This is just a new study.
[2:08:43.240 --> 2:08:45.240]  It used to be like one in 30 something thousand.
[2:08:45.240 --> 2:08:50.240]  Now it's one in 58 in the US, one in 30 something in South Korea where they follow all the rules.
[2:08:50.240 --> 2:08:51.240]  They take all the vaccines.
[2:08:51.240 --> 2:08:59.240]  South Koreans by the age of 10 take over 100 shots.
[2:08:59.240 --> 2:09:03.240]  I mean, everybody's got family that got killed or got sick from a vaccine.
[2:09:03.240 --> 2:09:10.240]  Most people been sick themselves.
[2:09:10.240 --> 2:09:13.240]  It's incredible.
[2:09:13.240 --> 2:09:15.240]  And so bingo.
[2:09:15.240 --> 2:09:21.240]  Now, Trump can't move mountains and all the rest of it, but he's gone back on Afghanistan.
[2:09:21.240 --> 2:09:23.240]  He's gone back on the vaccines.
[2:09:23.240 --> 2:09:28.240]  And I say we hold his feet to the fire and I promise you.
[2:09:28.240 --> 2:09:38.240]  The next time I talk to Trump, I will bring up the vaccines.
[2:09:38.240 --> 2:09:42.240]  And everybody should go out when he's on the road, hold up signs, all of it.
[2:09:42.240 --> 2:09:48.240]  Hell, we ought to sell t-shirts or, you know, at costs that say President Trump fulfill your promise on vaccines and go to the rallies.
[2:09:48.240 --> 2:09:51.240]  Believe me, that gets his attention.
[2:09:51.240 --> 2:09:55.240]  So Jenny is the caller because she's bringing up the real issue.
[2:09:55.240 --> 2:09:57.240]  Jenny, go ahead.
[2:09:57.240 --> 2:09:58.240]  Yes.
[2:09:58.240 --> 2:09:59.240]  Hi, Alex.
[2:09:59.240 --> 2:10:00.240]  Thank you for taking my call.
[2:10:00.240 --> 2:10:05.240]  I am a vaccine education specialist and I've been involved in this fight for several years.
[2:10:05.240 --> 2:10:14.240]  I have it on good authority that for our president knows very well what's going on with a vaccine issue and how dangerous they are and how they are.
[2:10:14.240 --> 2:10:16.240]  It's truly a crime against humanity.
[2:10:16.240 --> 2:10:21.240]  And I'm not thanking my lucky star for everything that he's doing because this is the key issue.
[2:10:21.240 --> 2:10:28.240]  He truly cared about the future of this country.
[2:10:28.240 --> 2:10:30.240]  He would take care of this issue not at 9 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.
[2:10:30.240 --> 2:10:32.240]  He would take care of it right now.
[2:10:32.240 --> 2:10:45.240]  What are we going to do when right now we have what, 1 in 36 on the spectrum, neurologically damaged according to the Crooked Center for Disease and Corruption?
[2:10:45.240 --> 2:10:46.240]  Talk about us.
[2:10:46.240 --> 2:10:52.240]  You're right. This is a mass dumbing down chemical and biological retardation program of eugenics.
[2:10:52.240 --> 2:10:55.240]  Just like the fluoride is meant to lower IQ.
[2:10:55.240 --> 2:10:59.240]  Just like taking iodine out of the salt lowers IQ 15 points.
[2:10:59.240 --> 2:11:04.240]  Fluoride lowers at 15 to 20 points just as much as they put in for kids and studies.
[2:11:04.240 --> 2:11:05.240]  Harvard studies.
[2:11:05.240 --> 2:11:08.240]  They're not having iodine 15 points on average.
[2:11:08.240 --> 2:11:10.240]  Anybody can search into that mainline studies.
[2:11:10.240 --> 2:11:12.240]  And then you add the electromagnetic stuff.
[2:11:12.240 --> 2:11:14.240]  You add the vaccines.
[2:11:14.240 --> 2:11:16.240]  That's why people are so stupid now.
[2:11:16.240 --> 2:11:18.240]  That's why type it into a search engine.
[2:11:18.240 --> 2:11:21.240]  Western IQs are dropping precipitously.
[2:11:21.240 --> 2:11:27.240]  Just like Brazil didn't accept glyphosates to like 25 years ago.
[2:11:27.240 --> 2:11:34.240]  Within 10 years, they went from almost no breast cancer to matching U.S. numbers.
[2:11:34.240 --> 2:11:36.240]  And glyphosate grows breast tumors, ma'am.
[2:11:36.240 --> 2:11:37.240]  I agree with you.
[2:11:37.240 --> 2:11:41.240]  I said, I thank God that we've got Trump in and at least he cares and has gotten something done.
[2:11:41.240 --> 2:11:42.240]  But you're right.
[2:11:42.240 --> 2:11:46.240]  When you talk about how California is trying to make it mandatory,
[2:11:46.240 --> 2:11:49.240]  they're firing doctors that won't force their people to take it.
[2:11:49.240 --> 2:11:54.240]  They're trying to lower the age and have schools make kids have their own consent and they pay them 200 bucks.
[2:11:54.240 --> 2:11:55.240]  It's criminal.
[2:11:55.240 --> 2:11:57.240]  And they're coming out with hundreds of new vaccines.
[2:11:57.240 --> 2:12:00.240]  They're pushing, which are live viruses.
[2:12:00.240 --> 2:12:01.240]  You name it.
[2:12:01.240 --> 2:12:03.240]  Gardasil sterilization.
[2:12:03.240 --> 2:12:05.240]  This is the modern Holocaust.
[2:12:05.240 --> 2:12:07.240]  And you're absolutely right.
[2:12:07.240 --> 2:12:14.240]  And, you know, there's a major pediatrics facility here in Austin that was founded by a man that retired eight years ago.
[2:12:14.240 --> 2:12:18.240]  He doesn't want me to say his name where he knows vaccines are bad.
[2:12:18.240 --> 2:12:19.240]  He told me personally.
[2:12:19.240 --> 2:12:20.240]  Okay.
[2:12:20.240 --> 2:12:27.240]  But now my own children went when we took the baby in there.
[2:12:27.240 --> 2:12:34.240]  They have the new nurse, the new doctor that runs in a female sheet, bullied my wife and said, get out of here.
[2:12:34.240 --> 2:12:36.240]  You're not going to get any treatment here.
[2:12:36.240 --> 2:12:39.240]  And because that's, so yes, they're bullying everyone.
[2:12:39.240 --> 2:12:41.240]  They're firing nurses that won't take it all.
[2:12:41.240 --> 2:12:42.240]  It's pure crap.
[2:12:42.240 --> 2:12:44.240]  The military troops don't want to take it.
[2:12:44.240 --> 2:12:46.240]  The officer corps won't take the vaccines.
[2:12:46.240 --> 2:12:47.240]  The military is given.
[2:12:47.240 --> 2:12:48.240]  They give them experimental vaccines.
[2:12:48.240 --> 2:12:49.240]  It's evil.
[2:12:49.240 --> 2:12:50.240]  And you're right.
[2:12:50.240 --> 2:12:52.240]  So what do we do to make Trump do it?
[2:12:52.240 --> 2:12:54.240]  Well, you know what?
[2:12:54.240 --> 2:13:05.240]  We're not going to have a military, a police force or a firefighters, fathers and anyone reproducing in this country, frankly,
[2:13:05.240 --> 2:13:11.240]  because according to MIT, there's going to be one in two autistic by 2030, 80% of the boys.
[2:13:11.240 --> 2:13:13.240]  And we can already see that happening.
[2:13:13.240 --> 2:13:16.240]  So he'd better do something and do something quick.
[2:13:16.240 --> 2:13:26.240]  I mean, RFK Jr., who was supposedly going to take up this, you know, vaccine safety commission, which, you know, seemed to just disappear overnight.
[2:13:26.240 --> 2:13:27.240]  He has.
[2:13:27.240 --> 2:13:28.240]  No, I totally agree.
[2:13:28.240 --> 2:13:29.240]  I've got an article here.
[2:13:29.240 --> 2:13:30.240]  Guys, pull it up.
[2:13:30.240 --> 2:13:31.240]  I can't find it.
[2:13:31.240 --> 2:13:33.240]  Yeah, there it is.
[2:13:33.240 --> 2:13:39.240]  MIT researcher, Glymasate will cause half of all children to be autistic by 2025.
[2:13:39.240 --> 2:13:41.240]  That's the American Council of Science and Health.
[2:13:41.240 --> 2:13:42.240]  I mean, this is all on purpose.
[2:13:42.240 --> 2:13:45.240]  We're dead already, basically.
[2:13:45.240 --> 2:13:46.240]  This is unbelievable.
[2:13:46.240 --> 2:13:47.240]  And I've got the other headline.
[2:13:47.240 --> 2:13:52.240]  Mystery pathogen is set to sterilize all women on Earth.
[2:13:52.240 --> 2:13:54.240]  There's now a mystery pathogen.
[2:13:54.240 --> 2:13:55.240]  It's mainstream news.
[2:13:55.240 --> 2:13:56.240]  I've got it right here on the stack.
[2:13:56.240 --> 2:13:58.240]  It's suddenly sterilizing everybody.
[2:13:58.240 --> 2:13:59.240]  We are under attack.
[2:13:59.240 --> 2:14:01.240]  You're absolutely right.
[2:14:01.240 --> 2:14:03.240]  Need iodine, exactly.
[2:14:03.240 --> 2:14:07.240]  I completely agree with you, but I just, I triple your dose with iodine.
[2:14:07.240 --> 2:14:14.240]  I take 50 to 60 drops a day, saturate the cells, and get rid of all of the competing halides that they're poising us with.
[2:14:14.240 --> 2:14:18.240]  And it is a plan, and he knows exactly what's going on.
[2:14:18.240 --> 2:14:23.240]  Oh, he does, just like he called in on the TV on 9-11 as if there were bombs in the buildings.
[2:14:23.240 --> 2:14:25.240]  And they called in another show a week later and said, I was there.
[2:14:25.240 --> 2:14:26.240]  I saw where the bombs went off.
[2:14:26.240 --> 2:14:28.240]  My engineer told me it must be bombs.
[2:14:28.240 --> 2:14:30.240]  So Trump's smart.
[2:14:30.240 --> 2:14:31.240]  He understands that.
[2:14:31.240 --> 2:14:32.240]  God bless you, ma'am.
[2:14:32.240 --> 2:14:33.240]  Jenny, you're absolutely right.
[2:14:33.240 --> 2:14:34.240]  She's absolutely right.
[2:14:34.240 --> 2:14:36.240]  We're going to go to break them up with more calls.
[2:14:36.240 --> 2:14:46.240]  Speaking of that, it is a fact that they keep lowering the amount of iodine in the food and the soil down to nothing.
[2:14:46.240 --> 2:14:53.240]  Survival shield X2 is the deep earth crystal source iodine, which means it's just pure iodine.
[2:14:53.240 --> 2:14:56.240]  It's atomic iodine, not radioactive, you know, the periodic table.
[2:14:56.240 --> 2:15:00.240]  And it is just what I did for my skin, my hair, my body.
[2:15:00.240 --> 2:15:02.240]  I mean, it's such a game changer.
[2:15:02.240 --> 2:15:04.240]  And then when I forget to take it for a few weeks, I'm like, what's going on?
[2:15:04.240 --> 2:15:05.240]  Oh, my X2.
[2:15:05.240 --> 2:15:08.240]  It's 40% off still.
[2:15:08.240 --> 2:15:10.240]  And I keep saying this for three days because I'm so busy.
[2:15:10.240 --> 2:15:12.240]  I haven't gotten a special watch.

[2:15:33.240 --> 2:15:34.240]  I don't even know.
[2:15:34.240 --> 2:15:35.240]  It's so amazing.
[2:15:35.240 --> 2:15:36.240]  I can't even get into it.
[2:15:36.240 --> 2:15:38.240]  I've got to do a ton of research.
[2:15:38.240 --> 2:15:40.240]  You can be able to talk about it properly.
[2:15:40.240 --> 2:15:41.240]  It's so amazing.

[2:19:00.240 --> 2:19:04.240]  Info Wars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up

[2:20:52.240 --> 2:20:59.240]  But first, we are launching today the InfoWars official app.
[2:20:59.240 --> 2:21:01.240]  It's amazing, it works great.
[2:21:01.240 --> 2:21:03.240]  It's got so many incredible features.
[2:21:03.240 --> 2:21:09.240]  You can download it free on Android and Apple at infowars.com forward slash app,
[2:21:09.240 --> 2:21:12.240]  or there's a big banner up on infowars.com.
[2:21:12.240 --> 2:21:16.240]  But why this is important is the globalists are demonizing InfoWars.
[2:21:16.240 --> 2:21:18.240]  We are the cutting edge at the tip of the spear.
[2:21:18.240 --> 2:21:24.240]  We are the dreaded organization that they hate so much.
[2:21:24.240 --> 2:21:27.240]  And they are so scared of people power.
[2:21:27.240 --> 2:21:29.240]  They are so scared of you.
[2:21:29.240 --> 2:21:34.240]  Not just downloading the app, but sharing it with your neighbors, your friends, folks at church,
[2:21:34.240 --> 2:21:39.240]  people at the grocery store, sending out a link to your email list
[2:21:39.240 --> 2:21:44.240]  or Facebook or Twitter and saying, hey, download the new free InfoWars app
[2:21:44.240 --> 2:21:50.240]  and get live video, archive video, the podcast, all the new podcast shows.
[2:21:50.240 --> 2:21:53.240]  We're going to start launching here in the next few months.
[2:21:53.240 --> 2:21:57.240]  The new broadcast, all of it, plus the latest news alerts, feeds.
[2:21:57.240 --> 2:22:01.240]  You can click a button and then get push notifications to know when things are happening
[2:22:01.240 --> 2:22:07.240]  or when I go live, routinely from my house or I come back into the office or when I'm on the road.
[2:22:07.240 --> 2:22:10.240]  It's the InfoWars official app.
[2:22:10.240 --> 2:22:12.240]  We're launching it today.
[2:22:12.240 --> 2:22:19.240]  It's at infowars.com forward slash app or there's a big banner right on the right hand side of the page
[2:22:19.240 --> 2:22:23.240]  on infowars.com, newswars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[2:22:23.240 --> 2:22:29.240]  There's a lot of features like listen in the background to have the show on during any activity.
[2:22:29.240 --> 2:22:34.240]  The video can be switched right to video, not just go to the audio function.
[2:22:34.240 --> 2:22:38.240]  A list of the latest shows, live notifications when we're going live,
[2:22:38.240 --> 2:22:45.240]  support the show, spread the news both in and outside of the app, see current super sales
[2:22:45.240 --> 2:22:51.240]  and browse the InfoWars store and get specials that we alert you to there via the app as well
[2:22:51.240 --> 2:22:53.240]  that are the biggest specials we do.
[2:22:53.240 --> 2:22:58.240]  Compatible on iPhone and Android devices, infowars.com forward slash app.
[2:22:58.240 --> 2:23:03.240]  Watch the Alex Jones show, the war room, the real news, anywhere, anytime.

[2:23:11.240 --> 2:23:15.240]  Favorite and save articles to read later when you have time.
[2:23:15.240 --> 2:23:20.240]  Go back through your article history to reread favorites or pick back up where you left off.
[2:23:20.240 --> 2:23:22.240]  There is so much more.
[2:23:22.240 --> 2:23:30.240]  Just check it out for yourself right now at infowars.com forward slash app and then please send that link out
[2:23:30.240 --> 2:23:36.240]  or show people the app and that's how word of mouth we'll get four or five, six million people like we got on the old app
[2:23:36.240 --> 2:23:39.240]  we launched six, seven years ago that was just audio only.
[2:23:39.240 --> 2:23:40.240]  Remember that one?
[2:23:40.240 --> 2:23:45.240]  That doesn't work on a lot of new phones and there's hundreds of fan systems out there as well.
[2:23:45.240 --> 2:23:46.240]  They're all great.
[2:23:46.240 --> 2:23:49.240]  We don't try to block people launching their own InfoWars apps.
[2:23:49.240 --> 2:23:50.240]  We just want to get the word out.
[2:23:50.240 --> 2:23:55.240]  But this one really is a great app, works a lot better than the last one that we launched.
[2:23:55.240 --> 2:24:02.240]  We've dealt with a lot of issues obviously in the tech companies and things with InfoWars.
[2:24:02.240 --> 2:24:07.240]  You can imagine in this political climate trying to get service out there.
[2:24:07.240 --> 2:24:09.240]  We've dealt with a lot of things.
[2:24:09.240 --> 2:24:16.240]  I'll just leave it that everyone can probably imagine and then imagine what Trump's going through when he's trying to implement things and do things.
[2:24:16.240 --> 2:24:20.240]  But I got to tell you, he talked about vaccines being dangerous.
[2:24:20.240 --> 2:24:23.240]  He talked about the things that give them too many.
[2:24:23.240 --> 2:24:25.240]  At the same time, too young.
[2:24:25.240 --> 2:24:28.240]  The Japanese don't even let you give vaccines until 18 months.
[2:24:28.240 --> 2:24:32.240]  But that is really his big failing because he knows good and you know what?
[2:24:32.240 --> 2:24:39.240]  Well, and I agree with the last caller and that actually makes me angry at Trump and we need to be angry when he's wrong.
[2:24:39.240 --> 2:24:47.240]  But I am so thankful Hillary's not there that it's that's why we're discussing this is why we're having this discussion right now.
[2:24:47.240 --> 2:24:54.240]  Okay, Randy says Trump is hypocritical hiring foreign workers. They'll go to Larry, Richard, James and everybody else.
[2:24:54.240 --> 2:24:59.240]  But Randy, he brags during the campaign.
[2:24:59.240 --> 2:25:03.240]  The media just, what the media says about him isn't true.
[2:25:03.240 --> 2:25:13.240]  It's like super right wingers got mad when he was inclusive to gays and others at the inauguration and before that at the whole confirmation when he got the nomination in Cleveland.
[2:25:13.240 --> 2:25:15.240]  He never said he hated gays.
[2:25:15.240 --> 2:25:18.240]  The media just said that.
[2:25:18.240 --> 2:25:21.240]  He never said he hated Mexicans. They were all criminals.
[2:25:21.240 --> 2:25:28.240]  He said I want to make it easier for people that aren't criminals to come in and actually take jobs where companies need it but not the expensive American workers.
[2:25:28.240 --> 2:25:30.240]  You're not going to be a criminal with a big rap sheet.
[2:25:30.240 --> 2:25:32.240]  And so it's the same thing.
[2:25:32.240 --> 2:25:33.240]  Of course he owns a bunch of hotels.
[2:25:33.240 --> 2:25:35.240]  He talked about it in the debates.
[2:25:35.240 --> 2:25:40.240]  He says I've got hotels with tens of thousands and golf courses with foreign workers.
[2:25:40.240 --> 2:25:45.240]  Just like cruise companies and they're from Russia and they're from Japan and they're from Mexico.
[2:25:45.240 --> 2:25:48.240]  Just like when you're on a cruise, everybody has different name tags.
[2:25:48.240 --> 2:25:49.240]  It's interesting.
[2:25:49.240 --> 2:25:51.240]  And they come in, they're seasonal workers.
[2:25:51.240 --> 2:25:54.240]  We don't need them, you know, say at the golf course during the winter.
[2:25:54.240 --> 2:25:58.240]  So they come in nine months out of the year and they rotate back to their country with good pay.
[2:25:58.240 --> 2:26:01.240]  Or they rotate somewhere else and they travel the world and they enjoy it.
[2:26:01.240 --> 2:26:03.240]  He goes I'm all for people coming in.
[2:26:03.240 --> 2:26:04.240]  We need them.
[2:26:04.240 --> 2:26:06.240]  And then people go oh, he's hypocritical.
[2:26:06.240 --> 2:26:08.240]  He brings in foreign workers.
[2:26:08.240 --> 2:26:10.240]  He never said that.
[2:26:10.240 --> 2:26:14.240]  He wants to have such a booming economy that we need to bring in people.
[2:26:14.240 --> 2:26:19.240]  But they're not going to be MS-13 people that kidnap women and murder them.
[2:26:19.240 --> 2:26:21.240]  Randy, go ahead.
[2:26:21.240 --> 2:26:26.240]  Well, you know, the way I see it is there's a lot of kids that need work.
[2:26:26.240 --> 2:26:31.240]  And, you know, for 12, 63 an hour, I imagine you're going to get all kinds.
[2:26:31.240 --> 2:26:36.240]  But I got to say one thing.
[2:26:36.240 --> 2:26:41.240]  I'm saying it just to prove a major that rings in Trump on tariffs.
[2:26:41.240 --> 2:26:43.240]  You know what I feel about that?
[2:26:43.240 --> 2:26:50.240]  I feel that never approach a bull from the front or a horse from the rear or a bull from any direction.
[2:26:50.240 --> 2:27:00.240]  Republicans and Democrats that back this major that puts the try to ring in Trump on these tariffs are fools.
[2:27:00.240 --> 2:27:02.240]  That's about all I got.
[2:27:02.240 --> 2:27:05.240]  Well, Randy, don't hang up because what you said is true.
[2:27:05.240 --> 2:27:06.240]  I don't respect that.
[2:27:06.240 --> 2:27:07.240]  That's crazy.
[2:27:07.240 --> 2:27:11.240]  Like, I just see what you, you know, say, like Trump is hypocritical on hiring foreign workers.
[2:27:11.240 --> 2:27:14.240]  And then I didn't think about the angle you were going with, because I didn't hear it yet.
[2:27:14.240 --> 2:27:16.240]  It was in, I think, AP yesterday.
[2:27:16.240 --> 2:27:17.240]  I didn't get to it.
[2:27:17.240 --> 2:27:18.240]  I saw it on Drudge.
[2:27:18.240 --> 2:27:21.240]  The headline was something like this.
[2:27:21.240 --> 2:27:28.240]  Illegal migrant workers causing job shortage problems for young Americans of all races.
[2:27:28.240 --> 2:27:38.240]  And it showed the numbers that we do have a glut of illegal aliens and a glut of people driving down wages in unskilled areas, even though other wages are going up.
[2:27:38.240 --> 2:27:39.240]  So you're absolutely right.
[2:27:39.240 --> 2:27:49.240]  This lie that Americans don't want to pick fruit or Americans don't want to know Americans have been taken off the land and domesticated.
[2:27:49.240 --> 2:27:55.240]  And would they rather be picking fruit for like $10, $12 an hour, which, you know, it pays or working at McDonald's for $8 an hour.
[2:27:55.240 --> 2:27:58.240]  And I say you'd be in a better position picking fruit.
[2:27:58.240 --> 2:28:00.240]  And by the way, I picked plenty of fruit.
[2:28:00.240 --> 2:28:01.240]  Go ahead.
[2:28:01.240 --> 2:28:02.240]  Let me give you an example.
[2:28:02.240 --> 2:28:08.240]  My kids, when they was younger, 13 years old, I put them to Tassel and Corn.
[2:28:08.240 --> 2:28:13.240]  They made minimum wage and the seed company got a tax break for putting them to work.
[2:28:13.240 --> 2:28:21.240]  They was kids coming out of the woodwork and they take them down by buses and they was kids coming out of the woodwork doing them jobs for minimum wage.
[2:28:21.240 --> 2:28:22.240]  I've actually done it.
[2:28:22.240 --> 2:28:23.240]  Yeah.
[2:28:23.240 --> 2:28:29.240]  Then what they did is they bring in a whole bunch of illegals or whoever they was and.
[2:28:29.240 --> 2:28:30.240]  Hold on.
[2:28:30.240 --> 2:28:31.240]  Stay there.
[2:28:31.240 --> 2:28:34.240]  I'm going to come back to you because you're an eyewitness to this and let's talk about this.
[2:28:34.240 --> 2:28:36.240]  Humans competing with each other for jobs.
[2:28:36.240 --> 2:28:38.240]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[2:28:38.240 --> 2:28:39.240]  It's a war of information.

[2:32:02.240 --> 2:32:07.240]  Hey, I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[2:32:07.240 --> 2:32:15.240]  I remember back when info wars and prison planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and I had to load down the page on my dial up internet.
[2:32:15.240 --> 2:32:20.240]  I thought it was pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests.
[2:32:20.240 --> 2:32:24.240]  And I've been using your product since the first iteration of survival shield.
[2:32:24.240 --> 2:32:31.240]  And since then I'm on the X2, the super male vitality, the caveman, the real red pill, micro ZX body. It's all amazing.
[2:32:31.240 --> 2:32:32.240]  Thank you, brother.
[2:32:32.240 --> 2:32:41.240]  Yeah. And I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[2:32:41.240 --> 2:32:46.240]  Just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[2:32:46.240 --> 2:32:51.240]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew and the listeners out there.
[2:32:51.240 --> 2:33:13.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:13.240 --> 2:33:24.240]  Big brother, mainstream media, government coverups. You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he live from the info wars.com studios.
[2:33:24.240 --> 2:33:27.240]  It's Alex Jones.
[2:33:27.240 --> 2:33:30.240]  Okay, we're taking a lot of calls today and I'm really enjoying it.
[2:33:30.240 --> 2:33:31.240]  We're going to go to Larry here soon.
[2:33:31.240 --> 2:33:35.240]  Matt at Trump about his prescription drug pain medication policy.
[2:33:35.240 --> 2:33:38.240]  Richard on Mormons promoting globalism, you've been really holding a while.
[2:33:38.240 --> 2:33:51.240]  Richard, you're up next. Stan Liberty Smith, James Duncan, but we got to finish up with Randy talking about illegal aliens taking the jobs from entry level Americans of every color.
[2:33:51.240 --> 2:34:00.240]  And there were Bureau of Statistics numbers I saw just yesterday confirming that that's going on in an overall more positive jobs market.
[2:34:00.240 --> 2:34:08.240]  We've seen in a hundred years, a lot of numbers show. So again, how does that have to do with Trump though?
[2:34:08.240 --> 2:34:23.240]  How is it hypocritical? I mean, do you really think he could hire high schoolers to come into a hotel for a maid service or to, you know, be a blackjack dealer or to be a manager or the captain of a ship or, you know, whatever the
[2:34:23.240 --> 2:34:33.240]  Trump properties have because that's the type of folks that they found do work best are these people that go all over the world to different countries, different companies.
[2:34:33.240 --> 2:34:39.240]  And they have backgrounds and they know who are the best who worked their butts off in the service industry. What do you think?
[2:34:39.240 --> 2:34:47.240]  Well, you probably got a lot of, you got a point there. And I believe it or not, I love Trump. I actually love everything he does.
[2:34:47.240 --> 2:34:57.240]  The only thing I just think for like cooks, waiters, whatever, they could hire kids or they could hire people in the United States to do them jobs.
[2:34:57.240 --> 2:35:06.240]  But that's because you're a hardworking guy, a farmer. I mean, I don't know how old you are, but I mean, the cliche is a little true, whether it gets black, white or Hispanic.
[2:35:06.240 --> 2:35:14.240]  A lot of young people today are, a lot of them are really hardworking. But a lot of them are super lazy.
[2:35:14.240 --> 2:35:20.240]  Oh, that's true. But, you know, I've been working since I've been 14 years old. I'm 65 now.
[2:35:20.240 --> 2:35:25.240]  Well, you get an eye opener when you get ready to draw Social Security when you find out how that really works.
[2:35:25.240 --> 2:35:35.240]  But the legal's got it better than I got. They got free medical, they get stifling a month, they get food stamps.
[2:35:35.240 --> 2:35:45.240]  Give me a freaking break. I've worked all my life. I pay taxes in the state of Indiana. God bless our heart. They just raised the gas tax on our ass.
[2:35:45.240 --> 2:35:46.240]  They hurt everybody.
[2:35:46.240 --> 2:35:54.240]  No, I hear you. And Trump's trying to bring relief. God bless you. Good points. Really good point.
[2:35:54.240 --> 2:36:01.240]  I mean, a lot of these people come out of Eastern Europe in places, they've already been vetted. They're the cream of the crop they're willing to work hard,
[2:36:01.240 --> 2:36:11.240]  which also creates a brain drain. And of course, then we have this guy. Remember the guy, the 30-year-old got evicted by his parents?
[2:36:11.240 --> 2:36:18.240]  And he is just like so selfish. Now we've learned more about what he's up to. And it's just, look at that spirit.
[2:36:18.240 --> 2:36:27.240]  It's like a demon of laziness. Just so satisfied that he can get you to do the way he wants it when he wants it.
[2:36:27.240 --> 2:36:32.240]  And that's what happens when you let your kids do whatever they want. Don't show him to me anymore.
[2:36:32.240 --> 2:36:40.240]  Michael Rotondo, we tried to help him, but he is just unbelievable.
[2:36:40.240 --> 2:36:46.240]  In the next segment, I've got Beyond Bombshell News, and I'm going to cover the deals with all of us in the future.
[2:36:46.240 --> 2:36:50.240]  If you manage to, I'm going to stop now, though, because I said we're going to go to your calls and get to them as quickly as possible.
[2:36:50.240 --> 2:36:57.240]  Richard in Arizona. Richard, what do you disagree with Trump on? Because that's the big subject today, and it's been all over the map.
[2:36:57.240 --> 2:36:59.240]  What do you disagree with?
[2:36:59.240 --> 2:37:07.240]  Hi, Alex. I was just wondering if you thought that Mormons were globalists and are on Trump's team or not,
[2:37:07.240 --> 2:37:13.240]  because I've been going to church there, and they don't pray for Trump, and they don't.
[2:37:13.240 --> 2:37:22.240]  If you're not holier than vows, then they kick you out, and all their money seems to go to Salt Lake City and enrich themselves.
[2:37:22.240 --> 2:37:28.240]  And I was wondering if you heard anything else about Mormons being globalists or not.
[2:37:28.240 --> 2:37:32.240]  Man, what does that have to do with Trump?
[2:37:32.240 --> 2:37:40.240]  They don't pray for Trump. If you mentioned Trump at church, they shut you out.
[2:37:40.240 --> 2:37:45.240]  Well, Mormons started out being a real right-wing, and there has been a lot of leftists getting there.
[2:37:45.240 --> 2:37:49.240]  I'm not a Mormon, so I really can't sit there and church of Latter-day Saints.
[2:37:49.240 --> 2:37:56.240]  With all perspective, I know a lot of our listeners are conservative Mormons, and a lot of Mormons were involved exposing the whole globalist conspiracy.
[2:37:56.240 --> 2:38:03.240]  So I don't want to say they're globalists, but I think they threatened the globalists with their political views and ideas from what I saw.
[2:38:03.240 --> 2:38:10.240]  It's an over-representation of Mormons in the John Byrd Society and exposing communism in the New World Order.
[2:38:10.240 --> 2:38:16.240]  So I think the globalists have made attempts, and clearly that's what's going on, to try to infiltrate it.
[2:38:16.240 --> 2:38:19.240]  They've done that to all the major seminaries, all the major churches.
[2:38:19.240 --> 2:38:29.240]  So I'm not really able to speak to that because I think it's such a complex issue.
[2:38:29.240 --> 2:38:36.240]  But I mean, you're there. A lot of churches get threatened and told, we'll take away your 501c3 tax exemption if you endorse the president.
[2:38:36.240 --> 2:38:43.240]  Well, no, you as a Christian can say, I like this person. You just can't then do like political fundraising or whatever.
[2:38:43.240 --> 2:38:50.240]  But that's it, even if you're 501c3 under the First Amendment, if a church hasn't gone under the 501c3 trick of becoming a charity,
[2:38:50.240 --> 2:38:55.240]  you can then endorse presidents, endorse candidates, you name it.
[2:38:55.240 --> 2:39:03.240]  And Trump has been moving to try to get rid of the rules that the Democrats and LBJ put in to where churches can actually go back and be real churches again.
[2:39:03.240 --> 2:39:06.240]  So I mean, I'm not informed enough to speak to that.
[2:39:06.240 --> 2:39:13.240]  I think the Mormons, like any other group, have cliques.
[2:39:13.240 --> 2:39:18.240]  And I've seen some of the Mormons were fighting Trump.
[2:39:18.240 --> 2:39:21.240]  They had a plan to try to deny the delegates to him.
[2:39:21.240 --> 2:39:31.240]  And I just think it's like Israel or anything else or the Catholics, you can't like, you can't like look at what one Catholic is doing or what one group of Mormons are doing or this and then kind of say it's the whole group.
[2:39:31.240 --> 2:39:34.240]  I mean, what do you think?
[2:39:34.240 --> 2:39:52.240]  I just think that they're set up as a globalist institution, and if they just opened up just a little bit to let their members do the good work that they do every day,
[2:39:52.240 --> 2:40:05.240]  that they wouldn't be so centralized, it's like money before Bitcoin, now money's decentralized, there's no central power.
[2:40:05.240 --> 2:40:11.240]  So if they decentralized their structure, it would be worldwide and it would be good and it wouldn't be a globalist institution.
[2:40:11.240 --> 2:40:16.240]  Well, the World Council of Churches is trying to take everything over.
[2:40:16.240 --> 2:40:19.240]  So there's the whole ecumenical movement, super bad news.
[2:40:19.240 --> 2:40:21.240]  I appreciate your call, Richard.
[2:40:21.240 --> 2:40:22.240]  All right.
[2:40:22.240 --> 2:40:24.240]  Who's up next here?
[2:40:24.240 --> 2:40:27.240]  Larry in Missouri, Trump policies on pain medication.
[2:40:27.240 --> 2:40:29.240]  Go ahead.
[2:40:29.240 --> 2:40:30.240]  Hi, Alex.
[2:40:30.240 --> 2:40:34.240]  I am so upset at Donald J. Trump.
[2:40:34.240 --> 2:40:42.240]  I'm a supporter of Trump, but he's missed an issue that's bigger than Kenny's vaccination problems.
[2:40:42.240 --> 2:40:49.240]  It affects more families in America than you even know, Alex.
[2:40:49.240 --> 2:40:55.240]  And I know that you know because you are the great history teacher for the world.
[2:40:55.240 --> 2:40:56.240]  Not really, but...
[2:40:56.240 --> 2:41:07.240]  And everyone that certifies, downloads your podcast in some way should get actual, not bachelor credit in college,
[2:41:07.240 --> 2:41:09.240]  should get like a master's of PhD.
[2:41:09.240 --> 2:41:13.240]  Listen, listen, you're kind of saying that, but brother, we only got a minute and a half here, two minutes.
[2:41:13.240 --> 2:41:15.240]  What is your point?
[2:41:15.240 --> 2:41:18.240]  Is it on the opioids or what are you saying?
[2:41:18.240 --> 2:41:23.240]  Well, I'm an ex-Olympian, ex-high school athlete, ex-pro athlete.
[2:41:23.240 --> 2:41:27.240]  And I broke 38 different bones 146 times.
[2:41:27.240 --> 2:41:29.240]  And I don't fit the paradigm.
[2:41:29.240 --> 2:41:31.240]  They were giving me too many pain pills.
[2:41:31.240 --> 2:41:36.240]  I had been it, but they've cut down 90% of my pain pills.
[2:41:36.240 --> 2:41:37.240]  I'm suicidal.
[2:41:37.240 --> 2:41:42.240]  I'm ready to move to Canada or go to Canada and get 90 days to fly legally.
[2:41:42.240 --> 2:41:46.240]  And you have not brought this up and people are dying.
[2:41:46.240 --> 2:41:53.240]  I know nine policemen in Kansas City that are snorting heroin because they can't get pain pills.
[2:41:53.240 --> 2:42:00.240]  And all these people, they've cut everybody off to 13 inches where the medical records, 21 films...
[2:42:00.240 --> 2:42:01.240]  Listen, here's the deal.
[2:42:01.240 --> 2:42:02.240]  Here's the deal.
[2:42:02.240 --> 2:42:05.240]  I know you're saying it's the biggest crisis on earth, and I'm sure for you it is,
[2:42:05.240 --> 2:42:13.240]  but half the women getting breast cancer or half the women being sterile or one in two people being autistic,
[2:42:13.240 --> 2:42:17.240]  I think it's all being mentally retarded is going to be bigger than the pain pills.
[2:42:17.240 --> 2:42:21.240]  They flooded synthetic hillbilly heroin everywhere.
[2:42:21.240 --> 2:42:24.240]  But let me come back and finish with you on this.
[2:42:24.240 --> 2:42:25.240]  It's important.
[2:42:25.240 --> 2:42:29.240]  I understand for you it's important, but the thing is the abuse is the issue.
[2:42:29.240 --> 2:42:34.240]  And so Trump's cracking down on it because it's gotten so many people addicted and hurt and so many overdoses.
[2:42:34.240 --> 2:42:36.240]  But we'll come back after this quick break.

[2:46:24.240 --> 2:46:53.240]  InfoWars.com
[2:46:53.240 --> 2:47:03.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:24.240 --> 2:47:36.240]  By the way, everybody's heard about this big Roe V Wade movie that's been shot in secret in New Orleans.
[2:47:36.240 --> 2:47:38.240]  I've known all about it for about a month.
[2:47:38.240 --> 2:47:40.240]  They wanted me to be in the movie, I'm not bragging.
[2:47:40.240 --> 2:47:45.240]  I just can't do it because I just have to refuse movies.
[2:47:45.240 --> 2:47:49.240]  But Roger Stone, a bunch of other folks are in it and a lot of big actors.
[2:47:49.240 --> 2:47:54.240]  He's got an actress exclusively who's in the film on about the sabotage, the way the left tried to block it,
[2:47:54.240 --> 2:47:58.240]  all of it, but the film has wrapped.
[2:47:58.240 --> 2:48:03.240]  And so you're going to get a first look at Roe V Wade coming up with Roger Stone.
[2:48:03.240 --> 2:48:10.240]  And it's got a whole bunch of folks in it, obviously, but not just Mr. Voight, but so many others.
[2:48:10.240 --> 2:48:12.240]  So the telegraph is reporting on it.
[2:48:12.240 --> 2:48:15.240]  It's a really hot film in the news.
[2:48:15.240 --> 2:48:19.240]  The less than reporting on it, trying to sabotage it, so Roger Stone will break that down for you.
[2:48:19.240 --> 2:48:23.240]  Now, I just can't say I'm not going to be in movies and then be in them.
[2:48:23.240 --> 2:48:25.240]  You know what I mean?
[2:48:25.240 --> 2:48:29.240]  Documentaries maybe.
[2:48:29.240 --> 2:48:32.240]  And they're nice folks to invite me to be in it.
[2:48:32.240 --> 2:48:34.240]  And I'm not saying that to act like I'm cool.
[2:48:34.240 --> 2:48:43.240]  I'm just, when you got news like this and I'm going back to your calls, that's all that really matters.
[2:48:43.240 --> 2:48:58.240]  We showed a headline earlier from the National Institutes of Health that half the public within about a decade will be mentally retarded
[2:48:58.240 --> 2:49:04.240]  and have some form of autism or neurological disorder just because of life of states eat your brain.
[2:49:04.240 --> 2:49:06.240]  They also give you breast cancer.
[2:49:06.240 --> 2:49:14.240]  Well, the National Health Service and others have come out to the Daily Star, but it's also a lot of other publications.
[2:49:14.240 --> 2:49:15.240]  STI warning.
[2:49:15.240 --> 2:49:16.240]  Well, it's beyond that.
[2:49:16.240 --> 2:49:22.240]  Experts fear stealth bug, which makes women infertile, will be untreatable.
[2:49:22.240 --> 2:49:29.240]  When these microplasms, little microscopic bacteria, they come in and they colonize women, particularly for whatever reason.
[2:49:29.240 --> 2:49:35.240]  It's kind of like fluoride hurts men worse than women because they have a different physiology.
[2:49:35.240 --> 2:49:40.240]  Well, microplasms, every time you run into this with women, I know a lot of women that have them.
[2:49:40.240 --> 2:49:44.240]  And I talk about microplasms with scientists 20 years ago.
[2:49:44.240 --> 2:49:45.240]  They still weren't confirmed.
[2:49:45.240 --> 2:49:48.240]  They're now confirmed.
[2:49:48.240 --> 2:49:51.240]  Now they have a microplasm that sterilizes you.
[2:49:51.240 --> 2:49:57.240]  Microplasma genitalium bug known as MG makes women infertile.
[2:49:57.240 --> 2:50:05.240]  One in every 100 British adults ages 18 to 44 already thought to be infected with the bug.
[2:50:05.240 --> 2:50:07.240]  Isn't that just convenient?
[2:50:07.240 --> 2:50:12.240]  Experts and, of course, most scientists believe that microplasms have been developed as bio weapons and labs.
[2:50:12.240 --> 2:50:16.240]  Experts are warning that the figure is set to double within 10 years.
[2:50:16.240 --> 2:50:21.240]  And then they go on to say that they are concerned that it will surpass HIV.
[2:50:21.240 --> 2:50:22.240]  You name it.
[2:50:22.240 --> 2:50:33.240]  It goes in and attacks the womb, the uterus scarring it, basically creating endometriosis and is a bio weapon.
[2:50:33.240 --> 2:50:37.240]  Whether from nature or man, that sterilizes you.
[2:50:37.240 --> 2:50:42.240]  So I thought I'd just say about some of that, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:50:42.240 --> 2:50:47.240]  Briefly, because I need to plug this, we've got so many affiliates, so many new stations.
[2:50:47.240 --> 2:50:52.240]  Picking up the radio slash TV transmission that I need to cut a whole bunch of liners today for stations.
[2:50:52.240 --> 2:50:55.240]  But here's just some of the new stations.
[2:50:55.240 --> 2:50:59.240]  Radio affiliate West Plains, Missouri.
[2:50:59.240 --> 2:51:03.240]  KWPM 1450 AM.
[2:51:03.240 --> 2:51:09.240]  There's the Alex Jones show the Ozarks news radio radio dot com.
[2:51:09.240 --> 2:51:14.240]  Ozark news talk radio dot com TV cable affiliates we just got this week.
[2:51:14.240 --> 2:51:22.240]  Ridgecrest, California info or TV now on cable one channel 21 weeks like going to the basic cable.
[2:51:22.240 --> 2:51:27.240]  That's where the audience is via KGZ in TV on channel 21.
[2:51:27.240 --> 2:51:34.240]  Very excited about that KZGN.net KZGN.net.
[2:51:34.240 --> 2:51:45.240]  Boise, Idaho info or TV now on cable one channel 64 via treasure Valley Community Television.

[2:52:06.240 --> 2:52:07.240]  And I'm going to start reading these every day.
[2:52:07.240 --> 2:52:10.240]  That's how many affiliates were getting all very exciting.
[2:52:10.240 --> 2:52:11.240]  None are too small.
[2:52:11.240 --> 2:52:12.240]  None are too big.
[2:52:12.240 --> 2:52:13.240]  We love everybody.
[2:52:13.240 --> 2:52:15.240]  The big thing is you find us on local TV.
[2:52:15.240 --> 2:52:16.240]  Tell folks about it.
[2:52:16.240 --> 2:52:18.240]  That's how we win the war.
[2:52:18.240 --> 2:52:20.240]  Trying to sit us off the web.
[2:52:20.240 --> 2:52:22.240]  Well, we're going to expand everywhere.
[2:52:22.240 --> 2:52:24.240]  Don't you worry.
[2:52:24.240 --> 2:52:29.240]  400 plus TV stations, 80 plus cable stations, some giant, some small.
[2:52:29.240 --> 2:52:30.240]  Doesn't matter.
[2:52:30.240 --> 2:52:32.240]  It's beautiful.
[2:52:32.240 --> 2:52:33.240]  All right.
[2:52:33.240 --> 2:52:35.240]  Who was I talking to?
[2:52:35.240 --> 2:52:40.240]  We're talking to Larry about policies of medication.
[2:52:40.240 --> 2:52:43.240]  You know, opiate use and opiate addiction has climbed dramatically.
[2:52:43.240 --> 2:52:50.240]  And I can see how you think Trump really telling the drug companies stop lying and saying this stuff isn't addictive.
[2:52:50.240 --> 2:52:57.240]  And, you know, cutting it back could could could really make you move somewhere else to understand pain can be incredible.
[2:52:57.240 --> 2:53:01.240]  And managing it is really, really a big problem.
[2:53:01.240 --> 2:53:08.240]  But at the same time, these drugs are also very, very, very, very addictive.
[2:53:08.240 --> 2:53:12.240]  And so, you know, how do you think Trump balances that out?
[2:53:12.240 --> 2:53:15.240]  Well, Alex, first of all, you're a numbers guy.
[2:53:15.240 --> 2:53:16.240]  You're the history guy.
[2:53:16.240 --> 2:53:20.240]  I listened to you three or four times a day in the background.
[2:53:20.240 --> 2:53:21.240]  I don't drink.
[2:53:21.240 --> 2:53:22.240]  I've never felt a drug test.
[2:53:22.240 --> 2:53:27.240]  I've been on pain meds since I was 12 years old, 48 years.
[2:53:27.240 --> 2:53:33.240]  So there are addictive, but we were taught on us 15 how not to get addicted.
[2:53:33.240 --> 2:53:40.240]  But and I just ordered bio ease, but of course someone stole it.
[2:53:40.240 --> 2:53:47.240]  So hoping on on the hold for two hours, I could get my bio ease because I'm still trying to get my police report.
[2:53:47.240 --> 2:53:48.240]  But absolutely.
[2:53:48.240 --> 2:53:51.240]  Well, you can call me your stuff stolen.
[2:53:51.240 --> 2:53:52.240]  We'll, we'll, we'll know you some more.
[2:53:52.240 --> 2:54:00.240]  But bodies is turmeric, a well-known anti inflammatory ours is 95 percent curcumin and level, which is unprecedented.
[2:54:00.240 --> 2:54:01.240]  So yes, I'll put you on hold.
[2:54:01.240 --> 2:54:05.240]  Larry, we'll get your address and name and everything and we'll send you a bottle of bodies.
[2:54:05.240 --> 2:54:07.240]  So thank you so much. God bless.
[2:54:07.240 --> 2:54:09.240]  That's another good point.
[2:54:09.240 --> 2:54:10.240]  It's not going to work.
[2:54:10.240 --> 2:54:11.240]  It's good.
[2:54:11.240 --> 2:54:15.240]  Obviously it's opiates, but you know, turmeric, they've got ginger root.
[2:54:15.240 --> 2:54:19.240]  There's just a lot of things and I understand pain can be really serious.
[2:54:19.240 --> 2:54:24.240]  So it's a problem.
[2:54:24.240 --> 2:54:25.240]  I hear you.
[2:54:25.240 --> 2:54:26.240]  All right.
[2:54:26.240 --> 2:54:27.240]  Who's up next here?
[2:54:27.240 --> 2:54:33.240]  We have put blunders or blinders on with Trump.
[2:54:33.240 --> 2:54:39.240]  And then we've also got Stan was talking about exposing 9 11 will not cause a civil war.
[2:54:39.240 --> 2:54:43.240]  We've got Duncan says follow up on the vaccine call.
[2:54:43.240 --> 2:54:48.240]  Let's, let's continue with the depopulation situation and talk to Duncan in Idaho.
[2:54:48.240 --> 2:54:51.240]  Is, is, is, is, is that a known to plume?
[2:54:51.240 --> 2:55:00.240]  Because Duncan, Idaho is the bodyguard of Paul Atreides in the original Dune book, not
[2:55:00.240 --> 2:55:03.240]  the cheesy movie, but the book's excellent.
[2:55:03.240 --> 2:55:06.240]  The first book, it gets a little esoteric and weird after that.
[2:55:06.240 --> 2:55:08.240]  But is that a known to plume?
[2:55:08.240 --> 2:55:10.240]  Is that a pen name, Duncan?
[2:55:10.240 --> 2:55:12.240]  No, no, that's my name.
[2:55:12.240 --> 2:55:14.240]  My dad gave it to me.
[2:55:14.240 --> 2:55:16.240]  I'm just a simple farmer in Idaho.
[2:55:16.240 --> 2:55:17.240]  I understand.
[2:55:17.240 --> 2:55:18.240]  So you are Duncan, Idaho.
[2:55:18.240 --> 2:55:19.240]  All right, go ahead.
[2:55:19.240 --> 2:55:20.240]  I'm in Duncan.
[2:55:20.240 --> 2:55:22.240]  My last name is Ferris, Alex.
[2:55:22.240 --> 2:55:24.240]  I was just having fun with that.
[2:55:24.240 --> 2:55:32.240]  Hey, I enjoyed the calls from James and also Jenny about the vaccination.
[2:55:32.240 --> 2:55:33.240]  Yes, sir.
[2:55:33.240 --> 2:55:36.240]  I just want during your conversations, you say, what do we do?
[2:55:36.240 --> 2:55:38.240]  What do we do?
[2:55:38.240 --> 2:55:44.240]  There's a Supreme Court case from 1901, Associate Justice John Marshall Harland Downs versus
[2:55:44.240 --> 2:55:48.240]  Bidwell said two national governments exist.
[2:55:48.240 --> 2:55:52.240]  One to be maintained under the Constitution with all its restrictions.
[2:55:52.240 --> 2:55:58.240]  The other to be maintained by Congress outside and independent of that instrument.
[2:55:58.240 --> 2:56:04.240]  And as I'm sure you're aware, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, when he referred to the military
[2:56:04.240 --> 2:56:11.240]  industrial complex, usually referred to it as the military industrial congressional complex.
[2:56:11.240 --> 2:56:18.240]  So as you always point out, we're under a foreign criminal corporate governance.
[2:56:18.240 --> 2:56:24.240]  And it's going to continue to be so, you know, if our military is all over the earth.
[2:56:24.240 --> 2:56:33.240]  But what I wanted to suggest was the John Birch Society has a mantra or a very good mantra
[2:56:33.240 --> 2:56:40.240]  and a very good lecture series entitled the Constitution is the solution.
[2:56:40.240 --> 2:56:45.240]  And in the Constitution, specifically under the Second Amendment, it says a well regulated
[2:56:45.240 --> 2:56:49.240]  militia be necessary for the security of a free state.
[2:56:49.240 --> 2:56:53.240]  The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[2:56:53.240 --> 2:56:55.240]  I'm sure you're familiar with Dr. Edwin.
[2:56:55.240 --> 2:56:58.240]  I believe his last name is Viviera.
[2:56:58.240 --> 2:57:00.240]  It works a lot with the oath keepers.
[2:57:00.240 --> 2:57:02.240]  Yeah, no, he's been on the show before.
[2:57:02.240 --> 2:57:06.240]  Great.
[2:57:06.240 --> 2:57:09.240]  President Trump can't do everything by himself.
[2:57:09.240 --> 2:57:14.240]  And I think the best way, you know, is to get everybody off their apathetic soap boxes and that.
[2:57:14.240 --> 2:57:19.240]  We need to restore the constitutional militia in every county and every state.
[2:57:19.240 --> 2:57:22.240]  Brother, the key is people awakening and taking action.
[2:57:22.240 --> 2:57:23.240]  You're doing it.
[2:57:23.240 --> 2:57:24.240]  And I salute you.
[2:57:24.240 --> 2:57:26.240]  And I really appreciate you.
[2:57:26.240 --> 2:57:27.240]  We'll be right back.
[2:57:27.240 --> 2:57:32.240]  I'll do a little bit more in the next hour than Roger Stone has that big exclusive interview on the new film coming out.
[2:57:32.240 --> 2:57:48.240]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[2:57:48.240 --> 2:57:55.240]  Info Wars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower and sink in your home.

[2:59:01.240 --> 2:59:05.240]  It's back in stock. The real red pill, it's been sold out for months.
[2:59:05.240 --> 2:59:09.240]  It's got the preglonone. That's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[2:59:09.240 --> 2:59:16.240]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins, the amino acids so you can upload it.

[2:59:30.240 --> 2:59:38.240]  Without you, we couldn't do it. So thank you all for remembering infowarstore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake,
[2:59:38.240 --> 2:59:44.240]  it's so essential to spread the word. Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[3:00:08.240 --> 3:00:13.240]  Broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[3:00:39.240 --> 3:00:50.240]  Read it for yourself. We are taking over and then you've got the Dutch here with their all little blonde haired children in the photo.
[3:00:50.240 --> 3:00:57.240]  This is unbelievable. Being taught to submit to Islam. The public schools take them to the mosque.
[3:00:57.240 --> 3:01:03.240]  This is the public school doing it and have them then get on their faces and submit to Islam.
[3:01:03.240 --> 3:01:08.240]  It's great that these kids are learning about other cultures while they visit the Middle East.
[3:01:08.240 --> 3:01:20.240]  Oh wait, it's Holland and then you've got all these sheep dipped women by the Islamists who aren't even allowed the mosque in the same area where men are,
[3:01:20.240 --> 3:01:27.240]  but the Islamists have let them do that to do it. So there you go, folks.
[3:01:27.240 --> 3:01:37.240]  It's on. It is a overwrite. It is a plan. It is the globalist operation.
[3:01:37.240 --> 3:01:45.240]  Guys, permit me that article please. Thank you. There's so many stories like that on infowarstore.com and I tend to forget to even tell you they're there.
[3:01:45.240 --> 3:01:52.240]  But to infowarstore.com is there. News Wars is there. Prison Planet is there and the establishment is working around the clock.
[3:01:52.240 --> 3:02:00.240]  It's trying to block us and shut that down. So when you download the free new official InfoWars app at infowars.com.
[3:02:00.240 --> 3:02:08.240]  Works really great. It's live feeds, audio feeds, news feeds, updates. You name it.
[3:02:08.240 --> 3:02:12.240]  And when you share it, that's how we get around the sensors. So please check it out today.
[3:02:12.240 --> 3:02:23.240]  InfoWars.com forward slash app. Okay, James, Louisiana. Go ahead. Thanks for holding. What's your take on Trump?
[3:02:23.240 --> 3:02:29.240]  That's your take on him, huh? All right. Thanks, James. Appreciate the call.
[3:02:29.240 --> 3:02:35.240]  I guess I held Duncan over and forgot I was doing that. So it's all kind of a train wreck here.
[3:02:35.240 --> 3:02:43.240]  Duncan, what was your point on the vaccines? Okay, Duncan's gone. Definitely, Alex.
[3:02:43.240 --> 3:02:51.240]  Definitely, we need to hold Trump's feet to the fire there. But getting back to solutions.
[3:02:51.240 --> 3:02:58.240]  Any way of having Dr. Edwin move your on again as far as reestablishing- Yeah, I probably had him on 20 times.
[3:02:58.240 --> 3:03:01.240]  We can have him back on. In fact, that's one of the regular guests we used to have on.
[3:03:01.240 --> 3:03:05.240]  I have all these regular guests. I just kind of forget about it over the years and never come back on.
[3:03:05.240 --> 3:03:08.240]  But yeah, that's the plan, Duncan. Thanks a lot, buddy. Anything else?
[3:03:08.240 --> 3:03:12.240]  Thank you. I love your heart, Alex. You're a good man.
[3:03:12.240 --> 3:03:18.240]  Well, I'm trying, brother. Some days I don't really get tired. Some days I'm just kind of like, you know, I see everybody,
[3:03:18.240 --> 3:03:24.240]  not everybody, but a minority of folks bitching at me about Trump or complaining about things.
[3:03:24.240 --> 3:03:28.240]  And I'm just like, no, I mean, I get we want things to even be better than what Trump's doing.
[3:03:28.240 --> 3:03:34.240]  But they're trying to take Trump out. And if they get rid of him, we'll go from getting this much done,
[3:03:34.240 --> 3:03:39.240]  you know, 95% to nothing. The reverse, in fact, a negative.
[3:03:39.240 --> 3:03:45.240]  And so I'm saying, yeah, push Trump towards the good policies. Absolutely. That's what we did.
[3:03:45.240 --> 3:03:51.240]  But at the same time, you've got to defend Trump because they are frothing to take him out.
[3:03:51.240 --> 3:04:02.240]  And, you know, quite frankly, it's a good talking point. And it's true. I mean, Germany is deep in bed with Russia for its energy.
[3:04:02.240 --> 3:04:10.240]  Russia wants to be friends with Europe. The EU is Europe's threat. So Russia's giving them incredibly cheap gas,
[3:04:10.240 --> 3:04:17.240]  incredibly cheap gas, natural gas, the biggest producer out in the world.
[3:04:17.240 --> 3:04:22.240]  And so Trump can point at Merkel, who's calling him a Russian agent and checkmate her.
[3:04:22.240 --> 3:04:28.240]  But it's kind of a cheap trick because it doesn't matter. We need more resources. We need commerce.
[3:04:28.240 --> 3:04:34.240]  We need to work with people. We need to have incredible tourism in America and incredible tourism in Russia
[3:04:34.240 --> 3:04:41.240]  and incredible tourism in Mexico and Europe and China and areas of Africa.
[3:04:41.240 --> 3:04:49.240]  We don't need to blow up civilization like Hillary and the globalists did. That's the big thing they do.
[3:04:49.240 --> 3:05:14.240]  It's too late now. It's too late now.
[3:05:14.240 --> 3:05:19.240]  Prebiotic fiber is soluble fiber that ferments in the gut to help feed good bacteria,
[3:05:19.240 --> 3:05:25.240]  which helps you digest food, absorb nutrients, and even support your immune system.
[3:05:25.240 --> 3:05:32.240]  InfoWarsLife's cutting-edge formula only brings you the highest quality, organic, and clinically studied ingredients.
[3:05:32.240 --> 3:05:36.240]  Cheap prebiotic fibers are used up only at the beginning of the colon,
[3:05:36.240 --> 3:05:47.240]  but our premium organic acacia fiber is slowly digested by the good bacteria throughout the entire colon for maximum prebiotic effect.
[3:05:47.240 --> 3:05:55.240]  Head to infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[3:05:55.240 --> 3:06:12.240]  Big Brother mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[3:06:12.240 --> 3:06:18.240]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[3:06:18.240 --> 3:06:22.240]  Welcome to your life. There's no turning back.
[3:06:22.240 --> 3:06:34.240]  Roger Stone is about to take over. He's got big exclusive on the very secretive filming and production of the Roe v. Waif film in New Orleans and other areas.
[3:06:34.240 --> 3:06:40.240]  It's gotten so much leftist attention and attempts to sabotage it. That's coming up with Roger here in just a few minutes.
[3:06:40.240 --> 3:06:48.240]  First off, though, this new story is on infowars.com, and it's very illustrative of everything we're talking about.
[3:06:48.240 --> 3:06:53.240]  I suggest everybody get it and share it because you're awake, but other people aren't.
[3:06:53.240 --> 3:07:02.240]  Muslim party leader, the main Muslim party financed by Turkey, Erdogan, the individual over there is financing this,
[3:07:02.240 --> 3:07:06.240]  trying to control all the Muslims in Europe and welding them into a coalition he controls.
[3:07:06.240 --> 3:07:12.240]  Muslim party leader tells Dutch to leave their own country if they don't like diversity.
[3:07:12.240 --> 3:07:23.240]  They told them that they should get lost. The leader of the Muslim DENK party in the Netherlands has caused controversy by telling Dutch citizens to leave their own country
[3:07:23.240 --> 3:07:28.240]  if they don't like the increasing number of Muslims, migrants, populating Dutch cities.
[3:07:28.240 --> 3:07:34.240]  And the cucked leftist public schools forced children to go to mosque and worship Allah.
[3:07:34.240 --> 3:07:40.240]  But there's no trips to churches. We actually have a photo.
[3:07:40.240 --> 3:07:46.240]  So this is the genocide of Western Christian culture.
[3:07:46.240 --> 3:07:52.240]  He went on to say if they don't like a changing Netherlands in which people with different cultures live,
[3:07:52.240 --> 3:07:56.240]  oh, but we can't go to Turkey and be Christian and set up our own thing or we can't go to Saudi Arabia.
[3:07:56.240 --> 3:08:00.240]  Oh, I get it. You're leaving your place to colonize us. I get it.
[3:08:00.240 --> 3:08:07.240]  If they don't like the changing Netherlands in which people with different cultures live, like Muslims now live in cities in the Netherlands,
[3:08:07.240 --> 3:08:13.240]  they should get lost. Tuna Han Kuzu said during an interview.
[3:08:13.240 --> 3:08:20.240]  Anti-Mash immigration politician Gert Wilders responded to Kuzu by telling him he should go home to Turkey.
[3:08:20.240 --> 3:08:26.240]  In 2017 Dutch election, Kuzu's party, which refuses to recognize their Armenian genocide,
[3:08:26.240 --> 3:08:32.240]  well, they told those Christians to go home, killed about a million of them, sent them right to heaven,
[3:08:32.240 --> 3:08:37.240]  attracted 200,000 votes, enabling it to gain three seats in parliament.
[3:08:37.240 --> 3:08:43.240]  So, yeah, you know, Christians get genocided. That's how you welcome them.
[3:08:43.240 --> 3:08:49.240]  A Muslim welcoming center for Christians is death, at least under their system.
[3:08:49.240 --> 3:08:54.240]  What Kuzu is specifically referring to when he speaks of a changing Netherlands remains unclear.
[3:08:54.240 --> 3:09:01.240]  Maybe he's referring to how every year a thousand underage Dutch girls are trafficking to sex slavery by pimps with migrant backgrounds.
[3:09:01.240 --> 3:09:08.240]  Maybe he's referring to schoolchildren being indoctrinated into the new diversity-friendly environment by being made to pray at mosque.
[3:09:08.240 --> 3:09:10.240]  Let's put that on screen, please.
[3:09:10.240 --> 3:09:14.240]  Maybe he's referring to graffiti scroll on the wall, a primary school that read,
[3:09:14.240 --> 3:09:17.240]  cancer Wilders is going to die.
[3:09:17.240 --> 3:09:27.240]  And a reference to the anti-immigration politician, attack Jews, kill all Jews, Jews going to die, or the term ISIS.
[3:09:27.240 --> 3:09:35.240]  Maybe he's referring to the fact that violent homophobic attacks on gay people in Holland by Muslim migrant use are increasing.
[3:09:35.240 --> 3:09:41.240]  Maybe he's referring to the fantastic economic benefits that Muslim migrants bring to the Netherlands,
[3:09:41.240 --> 3:09:48.240]  like the 85% of the refugees who remain unemployed and on welfare since they arrived in 2014.
[3:09:48.240 --> 3:09:55.240]  Maybe he's referring to Holland and Turkish population who occasionally stage riot in support of Islamist's dictator,
[3:09:55.240 --> 3:09:58.240]  Erdogan. In any case, the message is clear.
[3:09:58.240 --> 3:10:04.240]  Get on board with a new way of doing things or get out of our country.
[3:10:04.240 --> 3:10:06.240]  Roger Stone's taking over, my friend.
[3:10:06.240 --> 3:10:12.240]  A lot of news on Trump and standing up for the U.S. and more, lightest on Kavanaugh.
[3:10:12.240 --> 3:10:21.240]  So much more with the former head of the Trump campaign and Trump wingman of 40 years if these hills could talk.
[3:10:21.240 --> 3:10:23.240]  Roger Stone.
[3:10:23.240 --> 3:10:27.240]  Thank you, Alex. I must say, I think the beard is looking great.
[3:10:27.240 --> 3:10:31.240]  This whole Abraham Lincoln thing is really working.
[3:10:31.240 --> 3:10:35.240]  And I get a lot of text and email messages on it. People mention it to me.
[3:10:35.240 --> 3:10:38.240]  Your viewers really like it, I must say.
[3:10:38.240 --> 3:10:42.240]  It's more of a Ulysses S. Grant thing, but it's really working.
[3:10:42.240 --> 3:10:48.240]  It's kind of funny. I look like across the Ulysses S. Grant I was thinking, and who was the second command Mormon?
[3:10:48.240 --> 3:10:52.240]  They made a whole meme of me and Brigham Young.
[3:10:52.240 --> 3:10:54.240]  So when I grew the beard, I like Brigham Young.
[3:10:54.240 --> 3:10:57.240]  There's a little Sebastian Cabot in there as well.
[3:10:57.240 --> 3:10:59.240]  You're very nice, my friend.
[3:10:59.240 --> 3:11:00.240]  It's very good.
[3:11:00.240 --> 3:11:10.240]  So, Alex, we have uncovered an extraordinary scandal in which two royally protected British billionaires,
[3:11:10.240 --> 3:11:19.240]  both of them members of the Queen's Privy Council, which is essentially a protected royal class,
[3:11:19.240 --> 3:11:33.240]  billionaire investors, partners of George Soros have managed to obtain control of 90% of the electronic computerized voting machines in the United States.
[3:11:33.240 --> 3:11:34.240]  Wow.
[3:11:34.240 --> 3:11:48.240]  These two aristocratic partners of Soros have been heard in the posh clubs and private gambling parlors of London talking about their ability to bend American elections.
[3:11:48.240 --> 3:12:00.240]  What's interesting is that they didn't acquire Smartmatic, Sequoia, Daibold, ESNS, Dominion, and Hart Intercivic,
[3:12:00.240 --> 3:12:07.240]  who control 90% of the electronic computerized voting machines in the United States,
[3:12:07.240 --> 3:12:16.240]  but their strategy was to sell them all the exact same software, which is exclusive to the Brits.
[3:12:16.240 --> 3:12:19.240]  Thus, they control the count.
[3:12:19.240 --> 3:12:27.240]  It is a billion-dollar enterprise, and I think the President should bring it up with the British government,
[3:12:27.240 --> 3:12:33.240]  because it appears to me to be potentially, at least, interference in American elections.
[3:12:33.240 --> 3:12:47.240]  Now, the two aristocrats are Lord Mark Malick Brown, who is that gentleman right there, who is said to be a real favorite of the Queen,
[3:12:47.240 --> 3:12:52.240]  and his partner, Sir Jeffrey Patti.
[3:12:52.240 --> 3:12:56.240]  Now, there is Jeffrey Patti.
[3:12:56.240 --> 3:13:06.240]  These gentlemen boast about being protected by the Queen in their business activities in the United States pertaining to these machines.
[3:13:06.240 --> 3:13:10.240]  We reported this yesterday on the War Room.
[3:13:10.240 --> 3:13:20.240]  We were assisted in this by AmericansForInnovation.blogspot.com and the crew there on the Basic Research.
[3:13:20.240 --> 3:13:27.240]  Well, let's bring up the story, if we may, because it is far more complicated.
[3:13:27.240 --> 3:13:33.240]  These technology companies, in many cases, have been influenced by the national security apparatus,
[3:13:33.240 --> 3:13:40.240]  investments and infiltrations by the CIA and the FBI.
[3:13:40.240 --> 3:13:50.240]  So you can trace the whole history of this voting machine industry and how these two British globalists got control of it.
[3:13:50.240 --> 3:13:54.240]  And, Roger, when we come back from break, you'll have that story. You'll be able to go over it.
[3:13:54.240 --> 3:13:57.240]  But Soros already had control of the third of the machines.
[3:13:57.240 --> 3:14:02.240]  We know we caught Homeland Security under Obama stealing the election of many states.
[3:14:02.240 --> 3:14:04.240]  We blocked them and others.
[3:14:04.240 --> 3:14:06.240]  This is their main attack.
[3:14:06.240 --> 3:14:12.240]  They know they can't beat the big red wave, so in 2018 and beyond, this is how they're planning to do it.
[3:14:12.240 --> 3:14:16.240]  And, I mean, we need to alert the president to this. We need to take action to this.
[3:14:16.240 --> 3:14:18.240]  This is incredible.
[3:14:18.240 --> 3:14:23.240]  And that's what M4's job is to do, is to expose this level of garbage.
[3:14:23.240 --> 3:14:28.240]  I mean, just like we have the Chinese communists caught in our defense computers and selling us chips, it's the same thing.
[3:14:28.240 --> 3:14:33.240]  How can we have the Soros-connected, globalist-connected groups selling us the software?
[3:14:33.240 --> 3:14:36.240]  Well, here's the point, Alex. It's a multi-pronged strategy.
[3:14:36.240 --> 3:14:39.240]  They want to censor us so we can't object to it.
[3:14:39.240 --> 3:14:44.240]  Then they want to take away our guns so we can't defend ourselves.
[3:14:44.240 --> 3:14:48.240]  And then they want to steal the election. It's a three-part process.
[3:14:48.240 --> 3:14:58.240]  We see the war on censorship that's being waged against me, against info wars, against you, by the net left, by the tech left.
[3:14:58.240 --> 3:15:03.240]  We see that. Stay there. Come back and cover it all because you're right. They're launching attacks.
[3:15:03.240 --> 3:15:06.240]  They're trying to cause civil unrest. They're pushing anti-gun.
[3:15:06.240 --> 3:15:13.240]  And they're also discrediting anybody that talks about election fraud as they enroll illegal aliens to vote in all these Democrat states.
[3:15:13.240 --> 3:15:18.240]  This is an incredible time. StoneColdTruth.com, infowars.com, newswars.com.
[3:15:18.240 --> 3:15:20.240]  It's more important than ever.
[3:15:20.240 --> 3:15:24.240]  I keep saying this to spread the links, to spread the articles, to spread the videos.
[3:15:24.240 --> 3:15:30.240]  And as soon as this show isn't live, that we archive this, what headline do we give this, Roger Soros?
[3:15:30.240 --> 3:15:35.240]  British-controlled Soros companies now in control of 90% of voting machine software?
[3:15:35.240 --> 3:15:42.240]  I would say British globalist billionaires partnered with Soros CZUS voting machines. 90%.
[3:15:42.240 --> 3:15:45.240]  Yeah, I mean, it's unbelievable. Roger Stone, straight ahead.
[3:15:45.240 --> 3:15:55.240]  Then the war with Roger Stone. No employer after that. Stay with us.

[3:17:16.240 --> 3:17:20.240]  My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.
[3:17:20.240 --> 3:17:24.240]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[3:17:24.240 --> 3:17:26.240]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[3:17:26.240 --> 3:17:45.240]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[3:17:45.240 --> 3:17:53.240]  Stay with us.
[3:17:53.240 --> 3:18:01.240]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is. The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[3:18:01.240 --> 3:18:07.240]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater, and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[3:18:07.240 --> 3:18:14.240]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles, and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[3:18:14.240 --> 3:18:21.240]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[3:18:21.240 --> 3:18:26.240]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[3:18:26.240 --> 3:18:30.240]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter.
[3:18:30.240 --> 3:18:37.240]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[3:18:37.240 --> 3:18:43.240]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water.
[3:18:43.240 --> 3:18:48.240]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[3:18:48.240 --> 3:19:16.240]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[3:19:16.240 --> 3:19:21.240]  I know from using this myself the last few months, and from seeing my friends and family use it,
[3:19:21.240 --> 3:19:27.240]  that this new product is going to end up being the number one best selling product at infowarslife.com, because it works so well.

[3:19:49.240 --> 3:20:16.240]  Everybody needs to try Alpha Power today.
[3:20:16.240 --> 3:20:23.240]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show in your host chair today is Roger Stone.
[3:20:23.240 --> 3:20:29.240]  We have seen an extraordinary increase in the president's approval rating.
[3:20:29.240 --> 3:20:34.240]  It will at times dip a point or two, but then it continues to move forward.
[3:20:34.240 --> 3:20:43.240]  A recent poll that I saw showed that he has really broadened his support among union members.
[3:20:43.240 --> 3:20:58.240]  I think this is because of his trade and tariff policies and the fact that the administration has created one million new jobs since Donald Trump became president, 223,000 in May alone.
[3:20:58.240 --> 3:21:22.240]  Despite the fact that the administration backed the recent Janus decision that pertains to union dues and whether non-members can be collected from, which affects about 5 million of the 7.2 million union members in the country, the president's support among union members has risen.
[3:21:22.240 --> 3:21:34.240]  Now, there have been rumblings from some of his economic advisors and from the White House that he may reconsider his earlier position pulling America out of TPP.
[3:21:34.240 --> 3:21:55.240]  This would be a catastrophic mistake, not only because it violates the president's principles, but because it would also, in my view, cost him these union voters, mostly white Catholics in swing states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Florida, where I think he would lose support.
[3:21:55.240 --> 3:22:08.240]  I want to thank you for joining us here at the Alex Jones show, but also remind you that we are completely and totally listener and user supported.
[3:22:08.240 --> 3:22:13.240]  We're fighting an extraordinary war against internet censorship.
[3:22:13.240 --> 3:22:31.240]  The manipulation of my personal Facebook, the Stone Cold Truth is Facebook, the Stone Zone Facebook page. I, of course, am banned from life from Twitter pending a lawsuit which is taking shape.
[3:22:31.240 --> 3:22:45.240]  I said when Twitter banned me for life that I would sue them, then I decided to lay back and let others rush forward in a bunch of lawsuits, the grounds of which I questioned could be successful.
[3:22:45.240 --> 3:22:58.240]  Most of them, First Amendment oriented, were dismissed, but one lawsuit survived, one based on business principles and contract law that appears to be promising.
[3:22:58.240 --> 3:23:13.240]  I know that Milo and dozens of other conservative voices are prepared to join me in a lawsuit, but it must be a lawsuit against Twitter that has the potential to win, and I think we have found such a legal issue.
[3:23:13.240 --> 3:23:25.240]  So, but Twitter is among those who are kneecapping conservatives and who are silencing our voices.
[3:23:25.240 --> 3:23:48.240]  It is insidious, for example, in the sale of my book, Stone's Rules, which by the way, you can get at the Infowars.com store right now for $22.99, and if you will send it to me personally, if you get it on the Infowars.com store and include your shipping receipt,
[3:23:48.240 --> 3:23:58.240]  I will gladly sign it and send it back to you at my own expense, if you of course want to include postage, that would be fine as well.
[3:23:58.240 --> 3:24:08.240]  This is an offer only for those who can buy at Infowars and include their Infowars receipt, but it is my privilege to do this.
[3:24:08.240 --> 3:24:27.240]  I signed about 80 books last night and took them to UPS. The book has done quite well despite the fact that Facebook, whenever I attempt to post a paid promotion utilizing any link to purchase the book,
[3:24:27.240 --> 3:24:40.240]  immediately rejects the ad as being political advertising, which quite clearly it is not. This book doesn't have an ideological bend.
[3:24:40.240 --> 3:24:50.240]  You can certainly tell my politics by reading it because my anecdotes are about my own experiences, but you could be a Bernie Sanders progressive and benefit from this book.
[3:24:50.240 --> 3:25:00.240]  You could be non-political and benefit from this book. You can be a fervent Trump supporter and you will enjoy this book.
[3:25:00.240 --> 3:25:14.240]  Whether your chosen field is business or the arts or technology or agriculture, whether it is politics or media, these are the rules of the road,
[3:25:14.240 --> 3:25:23.240]  the lessons of life that has been compared to Sun Tzu's classic art of war, but it is more than that.
[3:25:23.240 --> 3:25:30.240]  It is how to dress, it is how to take care of your clothing. It is what you need to know about automobiles, about dining,
[3:25:30.240 --> 3:25:38.240]  and of course for the young man, how to build a serviceable wardrobe at a reasonable price and take care of your clothing.
[3:25:38.240 --> 3:25:48.240]  How the impression you make based on the way you are dressed and the way you are groomed is how you show yourself to the world.
[3:25:48.240 --> 3:25:58.240]  These are my rules of the road and at the same time you get Dick Nixon's no longer secret martini recipe for the Silver Bullet
[3:25:58.240 --> 3:26:07.240]  and you get my mother's recipe for the greatest marinara sauce you have ever had, also known as Sunday Gravy.
[3:26:07.240 --> 3:26:13.240]  No, I don't want to argue about it. If you call it sauce, God bless you. It is Sunday Gravy.
[3:26:13.240 --> 3:26:22.240]  So go to the Infowars Store now. If you are not in the market for this terrific tome, I do have to mention that Brainforce Plus,
[3:26:22.240 --> 3:26:30.240]  which is really absolutely my favorite product at the Infowars Store, is now on sale.
[3:26:30.240 --> 3:26:41.240]  So this is a great product because when you work the long hours that I do and you have that dip of energy around now,
[3:26:41.240 --> 3:26:49.240]  you pop a couple of these and you get a certain mental clarity and a mental energy and a focus.
[3:26:49.240 --> 3:26:59.240]  Yet later that evening, it doesn't keep you up like these ramped-up, a fed-dream-based energy drinks do.
[3:26:59.240 --> 3:27:04.240]  It's not like drinking two red bowls, which you'll regret at 11 o'clock at night when you can't sleep.
[3:27:04.240 --> 3:27:14.240]  So let me recommend that you take advantage of this terrific special. That is a great price and it is absolutely true.
[3:27:14.240 --> 3:27:20.240]  I think Owen Shorer would agree with this. The war room would be impossible without this great product.
[3:27:20.240 --> 3:27:31.240]  Now, it is amazing to me watching the coverage of CNN of the President's trip abroad and the attempt in their crawl,
[3:27:31.240 --> 3:27:38.240]  in their headlines, in their chyrons to depict Donald Trump as a stooge of Vladimir Putin.
[3:27:38.240 --> 3:27:47.240]  The President goes there and he urinates all over Putin's largest economic deal, the most important thing he's working on,
[3:27:47.240 --> 3:27:52.240]  yet CNN wants us to believe that Trump is in Vladimir's pocket.
[3:27:52.240 --> 3:27:57.240]  The bias of their coverage, it just knows no bounds.
[3:27:57.240 --> 3:28:02.240]  In other words, they've stopped even pretending to be a news network.
[3:28:02.240 --> 3:28:08.240]  Their headlines and their crawls are so acerbic and so partisan.
[3:28:08.240 --> 3:28:12.240]  You're on the Alex Jones show. I'm Roger Stone.
[3:28:12.240 --> 3:28:20.240]  Coming up is the actress Mindy Robinson, who tells us the inside story on Roe V. Wade,
[3:28:20.240 --> 3:28:25.240]  a movie that has just wrapped production and will be out in January.
[3:28:25.240 --> 3:28:28.240]  Hollywood is freaking out about this movie.
[3:28:28.240 --> 3:28:34.240]  Left-wing unions tried to kill it, but it's coming and it's a blockbuster.
[3:28:34.240 --> 3:28:39.240]  Right here, exclusively Mindy Robinson on the Alex Jones show.

[3:29:02.240 --> 3:29:08.240]  The Bug Assault, a miniaturized shotgun, which utilizes ordinary table salt as ammunition.

[3:33:15.240 --> 3:33:25.240]  Resistance to Pirates is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[3:33:25.240 --> 3:33:31.240]  Welcome back. I'm Roger Stone and you're on the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:31.240 --> 3:33:39.240]  I read a great tweet yesterday from Dr. Jerome Corsi, who is the Washington Bureau chief for infowars,
[3:33:39.240 --> 3:33:53.240]  who protested the fact that Paul Manafort is incarcerated in total lockdown in isolation in a maximum security prison
[3:33:53.240 --> 3:34:02.240]  when he has not yet been convicted of any crime in solitary confinement in a space the size of a closet,
[3:34:02.240 --> 3:34:10.240]  which can break a man over time. He still has three weeks to go until his trial.
[3:34:10.240 --> 3:34:19.240]  Yet the Awan brothers to Pakistanis break into the house computer system over 5,000 times,
[3:34:19.240 --> 3:34:27.240]  steal money, steal data, steal secrets, yet they serve not a day in jail,
[3:34:27.240 --> 3:34:32.240]  despite the fact that they try to flee the country with money.
[3:34:32.240 --> 3:34:38.240]  There's a certain lack of justice here in this situation,
[3:34:38.240 --> 3:34:45.240]  and therefore I ask every American to think about the tactics being used by the office of the special counsel
[3:34:45.240 --> 3:34:50.240]  in their treatment of Manafort who has yet to have his day in court.
[3:34:50.240 --> 3:34:57.240]  You see, they would like him to plead not now because they want him to roll over, but because they don't want to reveal
[3:34:57.240 --> 3:35:03.240]  the extent of the surveillance on him and how it was established through a Faisal warrant.
[3:35:03.240 --> 3:35:10.240]  The same is true in my case, where I have recently learned from credible sources that the surveillance on me
[3:35:10.240 --> 3:35:15.240]  began much earlier and was much broader than I had originally thought.
[3:35:15.240 --> 3:35:22.240]  I have filed, freed of information, Act Request was over 30 different agencies of the government.
[3:35:22.240 --> 3:35:28.240]  I've gotten a response from virtually all of them, but they are empty handed telling me that they'll look,
[3:35:28.240 --> 3:35:33.240]  but it could take years, or in other cases telling me I'm not entitled to what they have.
[3:35:33.240 --> 3:35:42.240]  A Faisal warrant can only be levied against a U.S. citizen if they're actively engaged in espionage
[3:35:42.240 --> 3:35:46.240]  on behalf of a foreign power against the United States.
[3:35:46.240 --> 3:35:58.240]  It is abundantly clear that the Obama administration, as reported by the New York Times on January 20th of 2017,
[3:35:58.240 --> 3:36:08.240]  targeted Manafort myself and Carter Page for a warrants because of our connections to the Trump campaign.
[3:36:08.240 --> 3:36:17.240]  The Page 1 New York Times headline says, wiretap data used in probe of Trump aides.
[3:36:17.240 --> 3:36:21.240]  That headline would change in their online version.
[3:36:21.240 --> 3:36:32.240]  Ed Klein also records the government's efforts to get Faisal warrants against Manafort and myself in his epic recent book.
[3:36:32.240 --> 3:36:41.240]  So I have no choice but to move forward. There are certain preconditions for a tort suit against the government
[3:36:41.240 --> 3:36:48.240]  pertaining to civil rights violations, in this case the invasion of my right of privacy.
[3:36:48.240 --> 3:36:58.240]  Such a lawsuit will not be fast, but there is no question that I was under surveillance.
[3:36:58.240 --> 3:37:03.240]  As were others for completely political purposes.
[3:37:03.240 --> 3:37:09.240]  I have no foreign clients. I don't have substantial foreign phone or mail traffic.
[3:37:09.240 --> 3:37:15.240]  I have traveled out of the country twice in the last five years or less.
[3:37:15.240 --> 3:37:29.240]  So it is an extraordinary that Mr. Rosenstein is essentially refusing to hand over to the Congress, a co-equal branch of government,
[3:37:29.240 --> 3:37:33.240]  the very documents regarding the subject were discussing.
[3:37:33.240 --> 3:37:42.240]  It's also extraordinary that Mr. Rosenstein himself personally signed to extend one of these politically motivated warrants.
[3:37:42.240 --> 3:37:53.240]  Thus I would argue that Mr. Rosenstein has a conflict of interest and he should either resign or accuse himself or the president should terminate him.
[3:37:53.240 --> 3:38:02.240]  It is absolutely clear that Devin Nunes and the Republican majority understand the Faisal warrants issue.
[3:38:02.240 --> 3:38:13.240]  The fact that Mr. Mueller does not want to disclose it in discovery at the Manafort trial and is claiming even today that Manafort was never under surveillance.
[3:38:13.240 --> 3:38:21.240]  That's been contradicted by Cheryl Atkinson and many other mainstream reporters based on solid reporting.
[3:38:21.240 --> 3:38:41.240]  In the fact that Mr. Rosenstein is risking his career to cover up the use of the Faisal warrants means that the deep state understands that we are on to the fact that they use the power and the authority of the state
[3:38:41.240 --> 3:39:02.240]  and its intelligence apparatus to spy on the Republican candidate for president to infiltrate his campaign and to have an insurance policy, as Peter Stroke put it, to ensure that Trump could be removed if something went wrong.
[3:39:02.240 --> 3:39:22.240]  The New York Times and the Washington Post would like us to believe that Professor Stefan Halper reached out to young Trump volunteers who had some campaign access, paid their expenses in some cases, not because he was looking for Russian collusion among these children,
[3:39:22.240 --> 3:39:33.240]  but because he wanted to plant faux evidence of Russian collusion in case the deep state had to trigger their insurance policy.
[3:39:33.240 --> 3:39:53.240]  Pardon me for a Marco Rubio moment. Thank you so much. It is obvious, therefore, that they have committed a crime far more egregious than Watergate, far more of a constitutional violation.
[3:39:53.240 --> 3:40:09.240]  In Watergate, the campaign of the president was associated with men, private individuals, who broke into the Watergate headquarters of the Democratic National Committee.
[3:40:09.240 --> 3:40:37.240]  Also, men associated with the president's campaign infiltrated the campaigns of Senator Hubert Humphrey and then later Senator George McGovern. But those were private enterprises, shocking, but they pale in comparison to the use of the machinery of state to subjugate and hijack an elections, which is exactly what happened here.
[3:40:37.240 --> 3:40:53.240]  The Russian collusion delusion is designed to distract us from the fact that this went on. There was substantial Russian collusion in the last election, as we know.
[3:40:53.240 --> 3:41:09.240]  Bill and Hillary Clinton took $145 million from the state-owned Russian energy company. Bill Clinton got a $500,000 tip for a speech to the same executives in Moscow.
[3:41:09.240 --> 3:41:27.240]  At the same time, John and Tony Podesta were making money from the oligarchs around Putin in banking, in gas, in uranium. So what better way to distract from the fact that the Clintons were in bed with Putin and the oligarchs around him than to point at Donald Trump?
[3:41:27.240 --> 3:41:41.240]  A better way to distract from the fact that you have a secret plan, working with the incumbent administration to hijack the election and ensure that Donald Trump could be removed if by some miracle he won. And he did.
[3:41:41.240 --> 3:42:01.240]  You're on the Alex Jones Show. I'm Roger Stone. Coming up with us, actress Mindy Robinson tells us the inside story on the hot movie Roe v. Wade. They just wrapped production on this blockbuster, and they kept the entire production secret,
[3:42:01.240 --> 3:42:17.240]  but there were rumblings as employees who were leftists or pro-abortion quit, union officers tried to sabotage the movie, but it is intact and is coming to the big screen in January.
[3:42:17.240 --> 3:42:34.240]  Mindy Robinson, if you're not familiar with I Heart Mindy on Twitter, is a MAGA firecracker, an articulate conservative with a libertarian streak, and a real ball of energy. You're going to want to check out her Twitter feed.
[3:42:34.240 --> 3:42:52.240]  It's lively, and she's going to give us the inside story on why Variety, the Hollywood Reporter, The New York Times, and everyone has flipped out about this new movie, Roe v. Wade. With Anthony Kennedy's resignation, this will be much discussed.
[3:43:05.240 --> 3:43:25.240]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles, and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels. To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH. What we learned was that there was, in fact, unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[3:43:25.240 --> 3:43:47.240]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter, and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels. As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water, so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[3:43:47.240 --> 3:43:52.240]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[3:43:52.240 --> 3:44:12.240]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from infowarstore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[3:44:12.240 --> 3:44:28.240]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer, and so it is essential that you purchase the products at infowarstore.com.

[3:45:16.240 --> 3:45:29.240]  It is a classical 360-win. This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.

[3:47:06.240 --> 3:47:23.240]  You are listening to an infowars.com frontline report. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[3:47:23.240 --> 3:47:38.240]  And that opening riff, a rare instrumental by the Rolling Stones on one of my favorites, was my theme music on my old show when I had a syndicated radio show before I joined infowars.
[3:47:38.240 --> 3:47:57.240]  So, we are back, and Hollywood has been roiled. The Hollywood Left, the New York LA connection, are up in arms over a new full production movie called Row v. Wade.
[3:47:57.240 --> 3:48:13.240]  The movie, mostly shot in Louisiana, was made under deep cover with a codename 1973, and not everyone who starred in the movie knew who the other characters were.
[3:48:13.240 --> 3:48:33.240]  Yet, as the script was read by more and more actors, and as more and more technicians were used, Ward leaked out, and some angry members left the cast. The director resigned, allegedly, for political reasons, because he objected to the movie's message.
[3:48:33.240 --> 3:48:55.240]  And Nick Loeb, who is the empresario of this entire project, stepped forward. Loeb is the dynamic young scion of the Loeb Rhodes banking family of New York, his father, the dashing Reagan ambassador to Switzerland, John L. Loeb, Jr.
[3:48:55.240 --> 3:49:16.240]  This is a first-class production. Nick Loeb became interested in this issue when he broke up with his paramour, his fiancé, Sophia Vergara. The two of them had combined his berm and her eggs to create embryos.
[3:49:16.240 --> 3:49:25.240]  He would like to bring them now. They're frozen. They're no longer together, but he sees them as life. She would like to destroy them, so they battle in court.
[3:49:25.240 --> 3:49:35.240]  Joining us now, Mindy Robinson, who will tell us all about why Nick Loeb has made this dynamic movie, welcome to the Alex Jones show.
[3:49:35.240 --> 3:49:38.240]  Well, thank you for having me, Roger.
[3:49:38.240 --> 3:49:49.240]  So that was kind of a long introduction, but if you look at these headlines, it's extraordinary how Hollywood and New York have freaked out about this movie.
[3:49:49.240 --> 3:49:53.240]  So tell us what's it all about and what was it like?
[3:49:53.240 --> 3:50:10.240]  I still have about a week left of filming. I'm excited. I saw a few articles, they were positive, and then the negative articles came out. And I find it kind of surprising because it's really, all it is is a true story of Roe v. Wade, which everyone knows the case, but no one actually understands it.
[3:50:10.240 --> 3:50:17.240]  It was flimsy. Go on Wikipedia. They'll say it was a flimsy argument. Probably shouldn't have been one. And that's all it is. It's a true story.
[3:50:17.240 --> 3:50:31.240]  And you wouldn't think Hollywood or liberals would lose their mind over it, but knowledge is power. And I think they're afraid if people saw, it's not just a clump of cells, that it is kind of a flimsy argument that people would might rethink it all together,
[3:50:31.240 --> 3:50:43.240]  especially with technology and all the market advancements. It's been 45 years since Roe v. Wade. Why are people still having second trimester abortions at all? All this stuff is easily solvable.
[3:50:43.240 --> 3:50:51.240]  So I think I'm worried about an educated populace changing their mind on the subject and the people in the fence seeing what it was and how snakey it was.
[3:50:51.240 --> 3:50:58.240]  And the true origin of Planned Parenthood itself was basically eugenics. So I think they're afraid of the truth.
[3:50:58.240 --> 3:51:14.240]  Now, look, I think the message of this movie is the Roe v. Wade decision was political, wasn't based on the law, wasn't based on their case. Their case was weak to say the least. This tells us the backstory, as I understand it, of the politics of how this happened.
[3:51:14.240 --> 3:51:25.240]  And the left doesn't like this. There are actors in this movie, actors and actresses who are pro-choice, but understand that this is a profession.
[3:51:25.240 --> 3:51:30.240]  But tell us some of the stars of this production, if you can.
[3:51:30.240 --> 3:51:40.240]  Obviously, we have Nick and he's been absolutely great. Once you see how his character evolves, you kind of understand the story so much.
[3:51:40.240 --> 3:51:48.240]  But I don't think a lot of people realize how many people that are really in this movie, the proponents of abortion, later changed their stance.
[3:51:48.240 --> 3:51:56.240]  You know, you had the invention of the ultrasound which allowed you to give a face to an unborn child. You had Roe herself who tried to overturn her case.
[3:51:56.240 --> 3:52:02.240]  Roe was losing her mind because women were coming up to her and thanking her. Like, thank you because I had six abortions because of you.
[3:52:02.240 --> 3:52:07.240]  You know, she wasn't supposed to be birth control at whim. It was supposed to be a desperate situation.
[3:52:07.240 --> 3:52:18.240]  I am one of those libertarian conservatives who once thought I was pro-choice because I didn't want the government telling a woman what she could do with her body. I thought that was her decision.
[3:52:18.240 --> 3:52:30.240]  I've been forced to rethink my views as I think so many people who were pro-abortion when they were younger but have had some time to reflect have done.
[3:52:30.240 --> 3:52:37.240]  It's amazing to me the way the numbers and the polling has changed towards a more right to life stance.
[3:52:37.240 --> 3:52:44.240]  I think this is based on the technology and the fact that you can see your baby and you can see that the baby is alive.
[3:52:44.240 --> 3:52:51.240]  So it's an amazing thing. Who are the stars? I know there's some Corbyn Bernstein is in this movie. Steve Hoffenberg?
[3:52:51.240 --> 3:53:02.240]  We've had John Voight from the beginning. He is just immense, even in person and on film. He's just such a powerful seasoned actor to have.
[3:53:02.240 --> 3:53:11.240]  To have people that have been vocal throughout the years. We have what? Stacey Dash attached. We have William Forsythe, who I love, who is a sweetheart.
[3:53:11.240 --> 3:53:21.240]  Steve Gutenberg. The IMDb, you just go down at Joey Lawrence. It's like a conservative superstar cast and some actors that are better in it for the art.
[3:53:21.240 --> 3:53:28.240]  They're not even pro-life, but they believe the story deserves to be told. We tell stories about serial killers all the time.
[3:53:28.240 --> 3:53:32.240]  How can we not tell a story that with a pro-life stance is ridiculous?
[3:53:32.240 --> 3:53:36.240]  Can you tell us what part you play? Who do you play in the movie?
[3:53:36.240 --> 3:53:44.240]  I play Ellen McCormick. She was a pro-life Democrat that ends up later on in life. She ran for president twice.
[3:53:44.240 --> 3:53:51.240]  She was the first woman to run and got Secret Service Protection and matched government funds.
[3:53:51.240 --> 3:53:59.240]  Her only platform was pro-life because at the time it was a death knell for politicians to pick one or the other because they wouldn't pick.
[3:53:59.240 --> 3:54:02.240]  And they're like, no, this isn't right. You need to pick or you pro-life approach.
[3:54:02.240 --> 3:54:09.240]  You need to really stop dancing around it. It's an important issue. And so that's what got her as far as what she did and stuff like that.
[3:54:09.240 --> 3:54:14.240]  And I'm pretty unrecognizable in the film. I won't look like my IMDb profile for sure.
[3:54:14.240 --> 3:54:21.240]  She's such a strong character and there's so much love for saving babies and doing all the stuff.
[3:54:21.240 --> 3:54:26.240]  And she really brings up a lot of the good points that people aren't asking about abortion.
[3:54:26.240 --> 3:54:31.240]  Why do you say pro-choice? That sounds so positive. How is that positive?
[3:54:31.240 --> 3:54:34.240]  It's really interesting because they're really cool cats.
[3:54:34.240 --> 3:54:43.240]  All right. Well, Mindy Robinson, tell folks where they can find you on Twitter and Facebook because your feed is always lively.
[3:54:43.240 --> 3:54:47.240]  I'm on Twitter at I Heart Mindy. I'm on Instagram at I Heart Mindy.
[3:54:47.240 --> 3:54:52.240]  I Heart Mindy page is the Facebook. You can find me on Facebook. That's probably where all the fun happens.
[3:54:52.240 --> 3:54:58.240]  Red White NFU is my commentary show I do that's very patriotic and that kind of thing.
[3:54:58.240 --> 3:55:02.240]  And if anyone wants to write me, it's American AF Mindy.
[3:55:02.240 --> 3:55:06.240]  Yeah, if you've got questions, if you want to know about anything, you know, I'm a patriot.
[3:55:06.240 --> 3:55:11.240]  I want to see this film get made and I want to tell a voice to the other half of America that hasn't had a voice.
[3:55:11.240 --> 3:55:15.240]  All right. There you go. Maga Mindy, thank you for joining us.
[3:55:15.240 --> 3:55:16.240]  Thank you.
[3:55:16.240 --> 3:55:17.240]  Thank you.
[3:55:17.240 --> 3:55:21.240]  I'm Roger Stone. You're on the Alex Jones show.
[3:55:21.240 --> 3:55:30.240]  It is quite extraordinary to be in a situation in which there is no evidence of Russian collusion,
[3:55:30.240 --> 3:55:40.240]  no evidence of collaboration with WikiLeaks, no evidence whatsoever that I knew about John Podesta's email release.
[3:55:40.240 --> 3:55:43.240]  And you have to edit my tweet to even infer it.
[3:55:43.240 --> 3:55:53.240]  Yet CNN reports that the special counsel is examining my finances. Reuters reports that several of my associates have been subpoenaed to a grand jury.
[3:55:53.240 --> 3:56:05.240]  And one of my oldest associates, Andrew Miller, who left me three years ago to become a legal marijuana farmer in Northern California is fighting a grand jury subpoena.
[3:56:05.240 --> 3:56:15.240]  Meanwhile, the government pokes through every molecule, every microscopic molecule of my personal business and political activities.
[3:56:15.240 --> 3:56:17.240]  There is no Russian collusion.
[3:56:17.240 --> 3:56:33.240]  The goal here is to either charge me with some unrelated offense to get me to testify against the president or to silence my voice as a critic of the special counsel and the president's critics.
[3:56:33.240 --> 3:56:39.240]  Either way, I need your help. Please go to the StoneDefenseFund.com.
[3:56:39.240 --> 3:56:44.240]  StoneDefenseFund.com. I need your help.
[3:56:44.240 --> 3:56:54.240]  Online stories that say I'm worth $20 million are planted, probably by David Brock, to discourage donors.
[3:56:54.240 --> 3:57:04.240]  We won an important victory in New York when we knocked out a lawsuit by an Obama-backed group over the very issues at hand.
[3:57:04.240 --> 3:57:10.240]  Russian collusion, the alleged hacking of the DNC, and the other fairy tale.
[3:57:10.240 --> 3:57:18.240]  Now I face a lawsuit from the DNC. These are not unlike the phony lawsuits that InfoWars and Alex Jones are facing.
[3:57:18.240 --> 3:57:22.240]  It is lawfare, the new tactic of the left.
[3:57:22.240 --> 3:57:27.240]  Thank you for your support and God bless you, victory or death.
