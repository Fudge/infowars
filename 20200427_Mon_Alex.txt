[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  It's Monday, April 27th, the year is 2020, 187 days out from the election, and the globalist
[00:12.000 --> 00:16.920]  coup against America and President Trump and against you and your family is live.
[00:16.920 --> 00:23.000]  This is the guide, the globalist guide to crushing the United States forever.
[00:23.000 --> 00:27.680]  If you are a globalist technocrat, I wish I could say that we're halfway through, but
[00:27.680 --> 00:28.680]  I don't think so.
[00:28.680 --> 00:30.720]  It takes time to make a vaccine.
[00:30.720 --> 00:33.440]  There's a lot about the disease we don't understand.
[00:33.440 --> 00:38.560]  We know that we can get out of this, but it's going to be a while before things go back
[00:38.560 --> 00:39.560]  to normal.
[00:39.560 --> 00:45.520]  I don't want to hear from those people who are out there protesting with guns, right?
[00:45.520 --> 00:47.760]  And that is threatening, a threatening look for people.
[00:47.760 --> 00:50.280]  You're protesting with guns.
[00:50.280 --> 00:55.440]  Don't criticize people who are taking a knee for at a ball game and entertainment.
[00:55.440 --> 00:57.640]  They say, I don't want people protesting at a ball game.
[00:57.640 --> 01:01.880]  When people who are peacefully protest, don't give me that when you're out there protesting
[01:01.880 --> 01:04.560]  with guns and saying, I want to get back to work.
[01:04.560 --> 01:06.280]  I want my liberty.
[01:06.280 --> 01:12.040]  Even a low-level, power-mad politician untold numbers who gassed up on the way here or grabbed
[01:12.040 --> 01:14.080]  a bite on the way home.
[01:14.080 --> 01:21.480]  We know that this rally endangered people, reveling in the prospect of order out of chaos.
[01:21.480 --> 01:27.360]  How can you do your part to assist in the demise of an entire country on forced lockdown
[01:27.360 --> 01:30.080]  due to the Chinese control of virus?
[01:30.080 --> 01:31.640]  Well, this is a good start.
[01:31.640 --> 01:34.440]  First you have to separate yourself from the chaff.
[01:34.440 --> 01:41.240]  As Greenwich Time reported, set in the director's office of the 270-acre Les Pars de Saint-Tropez,
[01:41.240 --> 01:48.200]  where LVMH luxury group chairman Bernard Alnog, Ritz Paris owner Mohamed Al-Fayed, and Indian
[01:48.200 --> 01:51.840]  steel magnate, Laxima Mital, have palatial fillers.
[01:51.840 --> 01:56.600]  The medical unit is staffed with a doctor and lab technician to take and process samples
[01:56.600 --> 01:58.680]  from residents and their friends.
[01:58.680 --> 02:03.360]  And if you live in the Hamptons, you can have a doctor come to your house for just $1,000
[02:03.360 --> 02:04.360]  a visit.
[02:04.360 --> 02:09.880]  As millions of average Americans lose their jobs, the billionaire class benefits.
[02:09.880 --> 02:15.360]  As Fast Company reported, though the coronavirus itself may not discriminate in terms of who
[02:15.360 --> 02:20.520]  can be infected, the COVID-19 pandemic is far from a great equalizer.
[02:20.520 --> 02:25.880]  In the same month that 22 million Americans lost their jobs, the American billionaire
[02:25.880 --> 02:32.240]  class's total wealth increased by about 10 percent, or $282 billion more than it was
[02:32.240 --> 02:34.160]  at the beginning of March.
[02:34.160 --> 02:39.520]  They now have a combined net worth of $3.23 trillion.
[02:39.520 --> 02:43.880]  Of course, the populace must be controlled and culled, as was written on the Georgia
[02:43.880 --> 02:45.200]  Guidestones.
[02:45.200 --> 02:50.600]  Silicon Valley will continue to do its part to censor any dissent while using their digital
[02:50.600 --> 02:56.000]  hurting platforms to monitor every life choice that the imprisoned populace makes.
[02:56.000 --> 03:01.480]  While the 5G grid rolls out and low-atmosphere satellites are positioned to aid in the Bill
[03:01.480 --> 03:06.840]  Gates Mark of the Beast mandatory vaccination scenario, one way or another everyone will
[03:06.840 --> 03:11.800]  be forced to submit their individuality to the Panopticon, and those that don't will
[03:11.800 --> 03:17.120]  become societal pariahs that will be cut off from the state, whether if it's by a chip
[03:17.120 --> 03:21.320]  under the skin or a tattoo on top of it, as Science Alert reported.
[03:21.320 --> 03:26.480]  For the people overseeing nationwide vaccination initiatives in developing countries, keeping
[03:26.480 --> 03:31.320]  track of who had which vaccination and when can be a tough task.
[03:31.320 --> 03:33.680]  Researchers from MIT might have a solution.
[03:33.680 --> 03:38.400]  They've created an ink that can be safely embedded in the skin alongside the vaccine
[03:38.400 --> 03:44.000]  itself, and it's only visible using a special smartphone camera app and filter.
[03:44.000 --> 03:46.360]  Or we could just give them all chips in the head.
[03:46.360 --> 03:52.840]  Of course it's key that currency becomes digital, as China is doing, working with U.S. multinationals.
[03:52.840 --> 03:57.680]  As Forbes reports, China, the country that banned initial coin offerings and made it
[03:57.680 --> 04:03.720]  tough for Bitcoin to operate, has been tossing around the idea to build its own digital currency,
[04:03.720 --> 04:09.080]  and some U.S. multinationals are reportedly willing to help roll it out, the South China
[04:09.080 --> 04:10.880]  Morning Post reported.
[04:10.880 --> 04:15.600]  Many American politicians will do their due diligence after being paid off by foreign
[04:15.600 --> 04:20.680]  entities to ignore the very laws of their land, as California is doing, for example.
[04:20.680 --> 04:26.000]  As Jamie White reported, California Governor Gavin Newsom awarded a Chinese Communist Party
[04:26.000 --> 04:32.080]  linked company $1 billion in taxpayer funds in exchange for $200 million protective mass.
[04:32.080 --> 04:38.440]  Newsom signed a $990 million contract earlier this month with Build Your Dreams, a Chinese
[04:38.440 --> 04:44.320]  electric car company, whose founder, Wang Chun-Fu, is a member of the CCP and has served
[04:44.320 --> 04:47.000]  the party in numerous official capacities.
[04:47.000 --> 04:51.560]  Gradually, if the current coronavirus doesn't force the Americans into trading their liberty
[04:51.560 --> 04:57.640]  for security, we have plenty more pathogens, compromise politicians, media, prostitutes,
[04:57.640 --> 05:02.480]  and there's a process where you take a stallion and you tie him down and you cut his testicles
[05:02.480 --> 05:04.240]  off and then he becomes gelded.
[05:04.240 --> 05:07.520]  Well, that's what's happening to the entire world right now.
[05:07.520 --> 05:09.120]  We're going into deep, deep tyranny.
[05:09.120 --> 05:12.440]  Well, it's like North Korea and China are going into deeper tyranny as well.
[05:12.440 --> 05:18.040]  It's all directed by the UN, it's all a big, cooked-up, giant plan to absolutely take
[05:18.040 --> 05:22.520]  control of your life, bankrupt the economy, and make you dependent on the big mega banks,
[05:22.520 --> 05:27.400]  and to get your universal income, you're going to have to take the inoculations, brainwash
[05:27.400 --> 05:31.280]  your kids the way they say, and have absolutely no freedom, and it's all happening, boom,
[05:31.280 --> 05:32.280]  overnight.
[05:32.280 --> 05:33.280]  This is a giant revolution.
[05:33.280 --> 05:36.560]  And as soon as you put the handcuffs on, they said, oh, it's just an extended spring
[05:36.560 --> 05:37.560]  break, two weeks.
[05:37.560 --> 05:41.600]  Notice now it's 18 months, two years, five years, it never ends.
[05:41.600 --> 05:44.080]  No one can ever die from a virus again.
[05:44.080 --> 05:45.720]  Government will save you.
[05:45.720 --> 05:46.960]  It's a takeover.
[05:46.960 --> 05:47.960]  It's the opposite.
[05:47.960 --> 05:50.120]  They're coming with forced inoculations on record.
[05:50.120 --> 05:54.640]  They'll reduce your fertility, lower your immunity, and in many cases, kill you, and
[05:54.640 --> 05:57.640]  they're telling you it's going to hurt a lot of people.
[05:57.640 --> 06:08.320]  It is Monday, April 27th.
[06:08.320 --> 06:11.200]  The year is 2020.
[06:11.200 --> 06:13.760]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[06:13.760 --> 06:18.920]  We're witnessing the globalist controlled demolition of the Western world, the free
[06:18.920 --> 06:27.640]  market system, the anti-human global carbon tax, the planetary lockdown, is here.
[06:27.640 --> 06:33.000]  The World ID, the total surveillance grid has all been publicly announced.
[06:33.000 --> 06:38.000]  Major newspapers are celebrating the end of the average person's free speech in the
[06:38.000 --> 06:46.160]  long, dark night of tyranny, but here is my message to the new world order.
[06:46.160 --> 06:49.200]  I think you can really be a gangster, huh?
[06:49.200 --> 06:52.000]  You got what it takes, huh?
[06:52.000 --> 06:54.000]  Roll with the big boys.
[06:54.000 --> 06:55.000]  I'm good.
[06:55.000 --> 07:07.960]  You know, the left sees me as Godzilla wrapped in Darth Vader, and that's because they
[07:07.960 --> 07:10.760]  believe their own propaganda.
[07:10.760 --> 07:15.600]  All I'm doing is exposing the horrible, assy things they're involved in, and so the devastation
[07:15.600 --> 07:19.400]  that that exposure causes them, they then attribute to me when they're the ones that
[07:19.400 --> 07:24.320]  committed these incredible crimes, and so now they tell me, we're going to kill your
[07:24.320 --> 07:27.680]  ass or put you in prison, and they're trying right now, and I'm just like, okay, you'll
[07:27.680 --> 07:32.720]  still be losers led by the Crip Keeper, Nancy Pelosi, and Hillary, and all these other insane
[07:32.720 --> 07:40.240]  weirdos, and Gigi Payne, and we're in martial law, we're all going to take force inoculations
[07:40.240 --> 07:45.160]  with the evil elf, Bill Gates hopping around giving speeches about depopulation, and I'm
[07:45.160 --> 07:48.920]  supposed to trust him when they give me a vaccine, okay, fine.
[07:48.920 --> 07:54.920]  You can destroy Alex Jones, but all you'll do is water the Tree of Liberty, but that
[07:54.920 --> 08:00.680]  is what Thomas Jefferson said, it's got to be water with the blood of patriots like
[08:00.680 --> 08:09.240]  Colonel William Barrett Travis, and Tyrants, and the thing about watering trees with patriots
[08:09.240 --> 08:15.200]  blood is, it just seems to create a harvest of blood for Tyrants, and that's why in the
[08:15.200 --> 08:21.760]  final equation, I'm not worried because I'm right where I'm supposed to be opposing you.
[08:21.760 --> 08:26.720]  So for myself and the rest of your humanity, to all you globalists, you're losers, you're
[08:26.720 --> 08:33.720]  going to fail, humanity's awakening, and you're going to burn it out.
[08:33.720 --> 09:00.720]  April 27th on this Monday edition, it is now in perfect 2020, Chris Clarity, 16 HD.
[09:00.720 --> 09:05.960]  This is a public world government takeover of what's left of the western world.
[09:05.960 --> 09:09.960]  The Communist Chinese model is officially being adopted.
[09:09.960 --> 09:15.640]  You will have an ID to buy and sell, you will have the mark of the beast, and computers
[09:15.640 --> 09:21.760]  controlled by eugenicist bioethic boards that are anti-human will control all facets of
[09:21.760 --> 09:26.680]  your life, not just medical decisions.
[09:26.680 --> 09:31.800]  What came out that's Senor Sinai, one of the most respected hospitals in the world, definitely
[09:31.800 --> 09:38.120]  in the top five, is doing light therapy and knocking out COVID-19, snaking tubes down
[09:38.120 --> 09:42.280]  into the lungs with fiber optics.
[09:42.280 --> 09:46.400]  Their Twitter has been banned, and their YouTube has been banned, and the company promoting
[09:46.400 --> 09:47.400]  it has been banned.
[09:47.400 --> 09:54.840]  Senor Sinai is now fake news according to Twitter because it backs up what the president said,
[09:54.840 --> 09:58.960]  and of course they're doing zinc therapy, intervenously, vitamin C therapy, mainline
[09:58.960 --> 10:05.320]  medical doctors, and they're now swat teaming them, the FBI, as even those places are authorized
[10:05.320 --> 10:06.640]  to do that.
[10:06.640 --> 10:09.800]  They do not want you to know that there's any hope, they want to force you into the
[10:09.800 --> 10:12.440]  vaccine, the digital ID that comes with it.
[10:12.440 --> 10:17.560]  But every day without looking, I see six, seven, eight, nine, 10 medical doctors from
[10:17.560 --> 10:22.760]  the United States alone, male, female, you name it, coming out and saying, we run hospitals,
[10:22.760 --> 10:28.400]  we run clinics, and we are seeing this being basically a hoax, I'm going to play a special
[10:28.400 --> 10:34.000]  report on that in a moment, then we come back, even the U.S. say today, did a fact check
[10:34.000 --> 10:39.840]  story and said, is it true that hospitals get paid way more for a COVID-19 patient
[10:39.840 --> 10:42.720]  and to stick them on a ventilator, which kills them?
[10:42.720 --> 10:46.840]  And it's true, that's why they've cleared the hospitals out to make more money.
[10:46.840 --> 10:52.200]  If you've ever had a cold virus or a flu virus, you test false positive, that's now confirmed,
[10:52.200 --> 10:56.400]  the test kits were contaminated, they give you COVID-19, but the Chinese and the CDC
[10:56.400 --> 11:02.120]  ones, it's all happening, and the globalists are panicking.
[11:02.120 --> 11:09.400]  They do not know what to do, because this is their main push, their giant hoax, and
[11:09.400 --> 11:14.080]  it got people going for a while, as Mark Twain said, a lie goes halfway around the world
[11:14.080 --> 11:17.520]  before the truth can put its pants on, but the truth's put its pants on, it's shirt
[11:17.520 --> 11:23.280]  on its shoes on, and it's loaded itself into a rocket, and it's going to catch up with
[11:23.280 --> 11:27.360]  the lie that's already gone halfway around the world, because its feet may be fast, but
[11:27.360 --> 11:32.360]  the truth, once it gets in the rocket, goes up into orbit and broadcasts the truth worldwide.
[11:32.360 --> 11:35.840]  That's what we're doing together, when you amplify this broadcast, you are literally
[11:35.840 --> 11:42.120]  saving lives in the entire future of the world, they are trying to attack and arrest and destroy
[11:42.120 --> 11:45.920]  everyone that tells the truth, the president is under coup attack right now, and the greatest
[11:45.920 --> 11:50.680]  danger ever, this is coup attempt four, I'll break it all down on the other side, but first
[11:50.680 --> 11:54.760]  here's an excerpt of the press conference with these doctors that's gone mega viral,
[11:54.760 --> 11:56.760]  here it is.
[11:56.760 --> 12:03.080]  After testing thousands of people in their county for COVID-19, doctors Dan Erickson
[12:03.080 --> 12:09.760]  and Arton Massini, owners of accelerated urgent care in Bakersfield, California, held a press
[12:09.760 --> 12:16.360]  conference to share their data along with official CDC data. Dr. Erickson reported that
[12:16.360 --> 12:21.720]  hospitals in California have become empty as a result of allotting all resources to
[12:21.720 --> 12:23.840]  the COVID-19 pandemic.
[12:23.840 --> 12:30.520]  The hospitals, their ICUs are empty, essentially, and they're shutting down floors, they're
[12:30.520 --> 12:34.560]  furloughing patients, they're furloughing doctors, because we just don't have the volume,
[12:34.560 --> 12:39.440]  so we're busy with paperwork for COVID, and we're all focusing on COVID.
[12:39.440 --> 12:43.080]  We then went over the COVID-19 numbers for the state of California.
[12:43.080 --> 12:51.240]  We've seen 1,227 deaths in the state of California, that means you have a 0.03 chance of dying
[12:51.240 --> 12:53.520]  from COVID-19 in the state of California.
[12:53.520 --> 13:00.400]  And for the state of New York, 19,410 out of 19 million people, which is a 0.1 percent
[13:00.400 --> 13:03.360]  chance of dying from COVID in the state of New York.
[13:03.360 --> 13:07.600]  And then compared these numbers to the seasonal flu in 2017.
[13:07.600 --> 13:15.600]  45 million total cases in 2017 with about 62,000 deaths, or a 0.13 chance of death from
[13:15.600 --> 13:22.240]  flu in the United States. So the lethality of COVID-19 is much less.
[13:22.240 --> 13:26.880]  He then went on to report what is happening as a result of the shutdown, and millions
[13:26.880 --> 13:30.080]  of hardworking people losing their jobs.
[13:30.080 --> 13:36.000]  Child molestation is increasing at a severe rate. We could go over multiple cases of children
[13:36.000 --> 13:42.080]  who have been molested due to angry family members who are intoxicated, who are home
[13:42.080 --> 13:43.760]  who have no paycheck.
[13:43.760 --> 13:48.560]  These things last a lifetime. This isn't about a seasonal flu. These are things that will
[13:48.560 --> 13:53.160]  follow these people and affect them in a negative fashion for their life. And these are for
[13:53.160 --> 13:58.000]  me talking to ERs, talking to my doctors, and talking to people across the country and
[13:58.000 --> 14:04.040]  finding out what they're seeing. Spousal abuse, alcoholism, anxiety, depression, suicide.
[14:04.040 --> 14:08.560]  One of the most interesting moments of the press conference was when Dr. Erickson went
[14:08.560 --> 14:15.280]  on to explain the immune complex and how our immune system regularly adapts to our environment.
[14:15.280 --> 14:19.920]  The immune system is built by exposure to antigens, viruses, bacteria. When you're a
[14:19.920 --> 14:24.080]  little child crawling on the ground, putting stuff in your mouth, viruses and bacteria
[14:24.080 --> 14:29.480]  come in, you form an antigen antibody complex, you form IgG, IgM. This is how your immune
[14:29.480 --> 14:33.840]  system is built. When you take human beings and you say, go into your house, clean all
[14:33.840 --> 14:38.520]  your counters, lice all them down, you're going to kill 99% of viruses and bacteria.
[14:38.520 --> 14:42.680]  Wear a mask, don't go outside. What does that do to our immune system? Our immune system
[14:42.680 --> 14:49.480]  is used to touching. We share bacteria, staphylococcal, strecococcal bacteria, viruses. We develop
[14:49.480 --> 14:54.400]  an immune response daily to this stuff. When you take that away from me, my immune system
[14:54.400 --> 15:00.440]  drops. As I shelter in place, my immune system drops. You keep me there for months, it drops
[15:00.440 --> 15:04.920]  more. Sheltering in place decreases your immune system. And then as we all come out of shelter
[15:04.920 --> 15:08.640]  in place with a lower immune system and start trading viruses, bacteria, what do you think
[15:08.640 --> 15:13.920]  is going to happen? Disease is going to spike. And then you've got disease spike amongst
[15:13.920 --> 15:18.520]  the hospital system with furlough doctors and nurses. Dr. Erickson reported that he
[15:18.520 --> 15:23.200]  has been in contact with leading physicians throughout California and that they are all
[15:23.200 --> 15:27.640]  in agreement. And I've been working with some of the leaders and I've talked to, you know,
[15:27.640 --> 15:33.240]  the head of the CDPH. I've gotten their opinion on this and a lot of the leaders in Sacramento
[15:33.240 --> 15:39.160]  and we're all in agreement. But we need to have Governor Newsom in agreement with us
[15:39.160 --> 15:45.640]  to lift this ban because the data is showing us it's time to lift. So if we don't lift,
[15:45.640 --> 15:57.120]  what is the reason? For Infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.

[16:33.840 --> 16:39.440]  own supply of off the grid electrical power just in case pay close attention. Here's why

[17:07.560 --> 17:12.560]  get your solar backup generator. We regret that supplies are limited and only available

[17:55.400 --> 18:02.840]  10 weeks ago, I began to tell listeners that they needed to get high quality, durable food.
[18:02.840 --> 18:07.560]  Not because of the virus, but because of the crises in the economic shutdown, it would
[18:07.560 --> 18:12.440]  cause, because the globe was planning to hold America hostage and run a blockade through
[18:12.440 --> 18:17.640]  the blue cities and blue states. Now that prediction has come true because the globalists
[18:17.640 --> 18:23.360]  are running an operation. It's not predictions. We have their battle plans.
[18:23.360 --> 18:28.040]  So going back more than eight weeks ago, all major storeable food companies were sold out
[18:28.040 --> 18:32.040]  except my Patreon supply because they're the biggest of a pre-position. When it got to
[18:32.040 --> 18:36.160]  the point that they had so many orders coming in that they wouldn't be able to fulfill them
[18:36.160 --> 18:40.480]  in a timely manner. They stopped taking orders till they got caught back up. Well, now they're
[18:40.480 --> 18:44.240]  caught back up. They've got high quality, durable food in stock, ready to be packaged
[18:44.240 --> 18:49.640]  and shipped to you. Get your orders in now at mforestore.com to go right at the head of
[18:49.640 --> 18:54.280]  the queue. You can deliver to you as fast as possible and from the mfore. Get your durable
[18:54.280 --> 18:58.880]  food now at mforestore.com. One of our best selling products is living
[18:58.880 --> 19:03.680]  defense and it's been sold out for over four months because it's hard to source the ingredients
[19:03.680 --> 19:07.160]  that are organic. We've got a limited supply right now, but it's selling out fast. And
[19:07.160 --> 19:10.760]  I want those of you that haven't experienced living defense to get it for yourself. Here's
[19:10.760 --> 19:15.120]  just part of one testimonial. I looked in January, 2016, I went in a hospital. I went
[19:15.120 --> 19:19.440]  to VA hospital out here in Boise and I was in there until June. And one of the only things
[19:19.440 --> 19:24.440]  that got me through that ordeal was listening to info wars three hours a day. And I kept
[19:24.440 --> 19:28.520]  here in Dr. Group and all you guys talking about living defense. Let me tell you something,
[19:28.520 --> 19:33.560]  man. I had an internal digestive problem and I stumbled with it for about five or six years
[19:33.560 --> 19:37.440]  and the doctors, they tried every test. Nobody could figure out what it is. And then every
[19:37.440 --> 19:40.960]  day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials, I said, you know what?
[19:40.960 --> 19:44.080]  I'm going to get me some of that freaking living defense. Now I wasn't supposed to have
[19:44.080 --> 19:47.280]  any nutrition because they don't want you to have a stuff, but I ordered it, had it
[19:47.280 --> 19:51.760]  shipped to me. I got it. I hid it from the nurses. I started taking it, man. That stuff
[19:51.760 --> 20:00.880]  changed my life. It saved my life. Alex Jones and info wars saved my life.
[20:00.880 --> 20:25.640]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show from the front lines of the information war. It's
[20:25.640 --> 20:35.760]  Alex Jones. All right, folks. I'm just going to lay this out right now because it needs
[20:35.760 --> 20:40.760]  to be done. And I can explain to the viewers and listeners one of the reasons you see info
[20:40.760 --> 20:45.920]  wars demonize and attack so much. And how we know President Trump's for real and the
[20:45.920 --> 20:49.880]  fact that he's for real is one of his great strengths. But it's also one of his weaknesses
[20:49.880 --> 20:56.480]  because he's not a swamp creature. So let me try to explain this from my own 100% documented
[20:56.480 --> 21:08.360]  spectrum right now. You know, I'll go to rebroadcast for a while and then I'll do this. I just
[21:08.360 --> 21:21.280]  it's just too big to sit here and even cover. So incredibly obvious how the criminals have
[21:21.280 --> 21:32.760]  taken over and what they've launched and what they've done. And we just sit here watching
[21:32.760 --> 21:37.160]  the country dismantled and tens of millions starting to starve to death all over the world.
[21:37.160 --> 21:41.480]  And the very criminals that launched the virus and cooked it up and caught red handed think
[21:41.480 --> 21:49.920]  the crimes are so huge we'll never be able to admit them to ourselves. But do you just
[21:49.920 --> 21:56.400]  think we got up here weeks ago and laid out that they get four to five to 10 times the
[21:56.400 --> 22:01.600]  money if they say you're a COVID-19 patient that the aid packages were already prepared
[22:01.600 --> 22:05.120]  before this ever got released. So the Trump would sign off on it not knowing what he was
[22:05.120 --> 22:11.040]  doing until we deliver money to certain big pharma companies and create as much death
[22:11.040 --> 22:17.800]  as possible. This is a decades long planned operation. They were playing the launch when
[22:17.800 --> 22:23.800]  their person was in power and when they had their ducks in a row. This is a takeover.
[22:23.800 --> 22:34.760]  This is deadly serious. Let's go to the V for Vendetta piece because again this is in popular
[22:34.760 --> 22:39.360]  culture how government would get into power how release a bio weapon how it uses for total
[22:39.360 --> 22:44.800]  control. But this is the shadow government the NIH the bureaucracy the chai comms the
[22:44.800 --> 22:48.560]  globalist that already had America that are starting to get kicked out that we're going
[22:48.560 --> 22:53.280]  to use this plan for total control over us and to roll out the cashless society and
[22:53.280 --> 22:59.320]  total system of surveillance once they had full control over the government but instead
[22:59.320 --> 23:03.880]  they're using it to throw the government out. That's why they're trying to discredit Trump
[23:03.880 --> 23:08.520]  at every front trying to make the collapse as bad as possible because this is their planned
[23:08.520 --> 23:17.640]  takedown. Movies like V for Vendetta absolutely document what's actually happened in history
[23:17.640 --> 23:23.400]  and other governments before using manufactured crises and then posing as the very saviors
[23:23.400 --> 23:35.640]  in that operation but just the magnitude of USA today having to admit OK it's true. Now
[23:35.640 --> 23:47.040]  they make you read four pages until they get to the part where they go yes it's true fact
[23:47.040 --> 23:52.160]  check hospitals get paid more patients listed as COVID-19 on ventilators and then it says
[23:52.160 --> 23:57.800]  nope says it's not true. Snopes and media matters are God but they explain how it's
[23:57.800 --> 24:07.640]  reasonable for three more pages that yes they get way more money if somebody has COVID-19
[24:07.640 --> 24:13.400]  but that ties into the empty hospitals that ties into all of it we're going to be doing
[24:13.400 --> 24:26.040]  it coming up and I mean folks this is life or death here OK. This is a coup against America
[24:26.040 --> 24:41.720]  a coup against the world a coup against common sense and it's happening right now. So let's
[24:41.720 --> 24:47.240]  go ahead and under the Vendetta piece here it is. You've information for us. No you already
[24:47.240 --> 24:51.320]  have the information all the names and dates are inside your head. What you want what you
[24:51.320 --> 24:57.240]  really need is a story. A story can be true or false. I leave such judgments to you in
[24:57.240 --> 25:06.640]  space. Our story begins as these stories often do with a young up and coming politician is
[25:06.640 --> 25:12.400]  deeply religious man and a member of the conservative party. He is completely single minded and
[25:12.400 --> 25:17.280]  has no regard for the political process. The more power he attains the more obvious his
[25:17.280 --> 25:23.840]  zealotry and the more aggressive his supporters become. Eventually his party launches a special
[25:23.840 --> 25:29.800]  project in the name of national security. At first it's believed to be a search for biological
[25:29.800 --> 25:36.480]  weapons I pursued without regard to its cost. However the true goal of this project is power
[25:36.480 --> 25:45.280]  complete and total hegemonic domination. The project however ends violently. But the efforts
[25:45.280 --> 25:50.200]  of those involved are not in vain for a new ability to wage war is born from the blood
[25:50.200 --> 25:57.840]  of a victim. Imagine a virus the most terrifying virus you can and then imagine that you are
[25:57.840 --> 26:03.600]  you alone after cure. But if your ultimate goal is power how best to use such a weapon.
[26:03.600 --> 26:10.360]  It's at this point in our story that along comes a spider. He is a man seemingly without
[26:10.360 --> 26:15.280]  a conscience for whom the ends always justify the means and it is he who suggests that their
[26:15.280 --> 26:20.440]  target should not be an enemy of the country but rather the country itself. Three targets
[26:20.440 --> 26:24.760]  are chosen to maximize the effect of the attack a school a tube station and a water treatment
[26:24.760 --> 26:30.280]  plant. Several hundred die within the first few weeks. That three waters has in fact been
[26:30.280 --> 26:34.520]  terminated. Authorities are attempting to control its deadly spread. It's a wave of
[26:34.520 --> 26:39.920]  destruction throughout the underground. Filled by the media fear and panic spread quickly
[26:39.920 --> 26:46.000]  fracturing and dividing the country into the last the true goal comes into view. Before
[26:46.000 --> 26:50.600]  the Mary's crisis no one would have predicted the results of the election that year no one
[26:50.600 --> 26:56.920]  and then not one after the election low and behold a miracle. Some believed it was the
[26:56.920 --> 27:02.920]  work of God himself but it was a pharmaceutical company controlled by certain party members
[27:02.920 --> 27:09.800]  that made them all seem rich. A year later several extremists tried found guilty and
[27:09.800 --> 27:16.320]  executed while a memorial is built to canonize their victims. But the end result the true
[27:16.320 --> 27:22.400]  genius of the plan was the fear. Fear became the ultimate tool of this government and through
[27:22.400 --> 27:29.320]  it our politician was ultimately appointed to the newly created position of high chancellor.
[27:29.320 --> 27:38.120]  The rest is the same history. Can you prove any of this. Why do you think I'm still alive.
[27:38.120 --> 27:46.840]  All right. We'd like to take you into protective custody Mr. Woodward. I'm sure you were. But
[27:46.840 --> 27:54.800]  if you want that recording you'll do what I tell you to do. Put creedy onto 24 hour surveillance
[27:54.800 --> 27:59.600]  when I feel safe that he can't pick his nose without you knowing I'll come to you again
[27:59.600 --> 28:10.080]  till then cheerio. We're upward. Why didn't you come forward before. What were you waiting
[28:10.080 --> 28:23.040]  for. Well for you inspector. I needed you. Which is the metaphor for us caring and standing
[28:23.040 --> 28:27.440]  up and getting involved. And that's why they want to put me in prison. I want to kill me.
[28:27.440 --> 28:34.640]  I can't get into it yet on air but I will soon. But they told me stop advising the president.
[28:34.640 --> 28:39.760]  My very existence means I advise the president. And I think I'm just going to lay it out on
[28:39.760 --> 28:46.000]  air like I didn't choke earlier but I just don't I just said I just go ahead and do this.
[28:46.000 --> 28:56.840]  I think I will before it's too late. We'll be right back on Alex Jones. Stay with us.

[31:12.480 --> 31:18.080]  pesky american people that have become too uppity bill marr even admitted man i hope
[31:18.080 --> 31:23.040]  we have a depression and how they tell her the whole thing with the big corporations
[31:23.040 --> 31:27.680]  in the media are going to keep the country closed along with the help of the blue states
[31:27.680 --> 31:33.440]  and blue states all the time blaming trump and capitalism and americanism for the depression
[31:33.440 --> 31:39.520]  it creates and america is that stupid we deserve what happens to us but as for me i'm not sitting
[31:39.520 --> 31:43.960]  here and i'm not taking it it's all the nanny state and the peer pressure that they're the
[31:43.960 --> 31:48.760]  good people keep everybody safe but that's not what they're doing they are pulling america
[31:48.760 --> 31:54.920]  up by its roots and irrevocably damaging our savings our health our whole world and committing
[31:54.920 --> 31:59.760]  millions of third world people to death i'm always excited about info wars live products
[31:59.760 --> 32:03.400]  they're amazing they're cutting edge you love them i love them and they find the info war
[32:03.400 --> 32:08.640]  in the face of the globalist onslaught but we have come up with a new product over a
[32:08.640 --> 32:17.120]  year in development that is amazing the only organic hand sanitizer on the market with
[32:17.120 --> 32:24.960]  organic essential oils on top of it and there's another innovation it's the spray cap it doesn't
[32:24.960 --> 32:31.480]  just pour out a bunch of thick gross you gooo but it's high quality it aerosolizes it in
[32:31.480 --> 32:35.960]  a really great way i like to put it on my hands rub a little bit on my face it's got
[32:35.960 --> 32:40.520]  organic alcohol in it so spray it right in your eyes but i just love it personally as
[32:40.520 --> 32:44.760]  something that's a moisturizer as well show this is a real innovation i don't know why
[32:44.760 --> 32:49.160]  others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has essential oil
[32:49.160 --> 33:10.960]  in it so it doesn't dry you out smells great it's so refreshing this is a big winner you're
[33:10.960 --> 33:22.800]  watching war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[33:22.800 --> 33:31.360]  the info war so there is a massive criminal conspiracy being carried out by powerful
[33:31.360 --> 33:39.840]  corporations and powerful governments against your country and the conspirators have been
[33:39.840 --> 33:45.280]  exposed their operations have come out what are they going to do well they're going to
[33:45.280 --> 33:51.840]  release a bio weapon it's a weapon they own a novel virus they've engineered the discoverer
[33:51.840 --> 33:59.120]  of hiv Nobel prize winner has said that you had other top scientists come out and say
[33:59.120 --> 34:06.200]  it's conclusive there's no doubt and then you look at Fauci and gates and the nih and
[34:06.200 --> 34:10.880]  the chikoms and the globalist and how they hyped up the fear how they released it how
[34:10.880 --> 34:17.080]  they blocked trump from stopping people coming in then how they turned around and blame trump
[34:17.080 --> 34:23.400]  it goes on and on and so they've launched their big giant bold move and they believe
[34:23.400 --> 34:27.400]  it's going to bring in their digital ID their force inoculations their total control it
[34:27.400 --> 34:32.280]  legitimizes their censorship they believe they're all over the news bragging about that crowing
[34:32.280 --> 34:41.980]  about it but things aren't going well for them there's major cracks in their operations
[34:41.980 --> 34:46.640]  and so when I talk about president trump being a normal person and actually trying to be
[34:46.640 --> 34:50.720]  the president and actually not doing what the globalist telling me it's because I personally
[34:50.720 --> 34:56.000]  know the back story from a lot of angles that other people wouldn't know if they weren't
[34:56.000 --> 35:02.600]  say a rush limbaugh a tucker carlson and alex jones and you better believe at the white
[35:02.600 --> 35:09.480]  house and everywhere they know info wars was and is even more influential than tucker carlson
[35:09.480 --> 35:14.760]  or rush limbaugh and I don't say that about a johnson measuring contest that's a very
[35:14.760 --> 35:21.160]  dangerous position to be in because in a war they're shooting for the top brass well they're
[35:21.160 --> 35:27.920]  certainly going to be looking for the general not just the lieutenant generals because I've
[35:27.920 --> 35:33.840]  got the big grassroots activist audience of real people and I have helped unify folks
[35:33.840 --> 35:39.360]  around liberty and freedom not about race which is exactly what trumps message is and
[35:39.360 --> 35:45.360]  so because of you and how powerful you are and how amazing you are the globalist want
[35:45.360 --> 35:51.520]  to destroy info wars but not turn me into a martyr they want to first discredit me before
[35:51.520 --> 35:57.480]  they kill me and the reason they're pissed off is and this is not just a story about info
[35:57.480 --> 36:04.760]  wars it's a story about trump story about you it's about assault that trump didn't know
[36:04.760 --> 36:12.040]  that a nobel prize winner arguably the top virologist in the world had the virus scanned
[36:12.040 --> 36:18.660]  and said yes it's completely manufactured in the lab trump didn't know that the top
[36:18.660 --> 36:23.080]  indian university scanned it and said the same thing three months ago two and a half
[36:23.080 --> 36:29.240]  months ago it's eleven weeks ago and it's not because smart people are around him they're
[36:29.240 --> 36:34.360]  all scared because if you bring trump real intel on who runs things like general flin
[36:34.360 --> 36:39.040]  did the former head of defense intelligence who had a whole group of patriots ready to
[36:39.040 --> 36:45.920]  come in and fix the country actual americans the military who know what's going on and
[36:45.920 --> 37:00.960]  help put trump in with the american people if we're gonna put something up there about
[37:00.960 --> 37:09.880]  the nobel laureate just put in nobel prize winner for virology says COVID-19 100% man
[37:09.880 --> 37:20.360]  made that's the article i want to put up if we do that now i'm gonna go to rebroadcast

[38:51.800 --> 38:56.360]  but i don't think so it takes time to make a vaccine there's a lot about the disease
[38:56.360 --> 39:02.280]  we don't understand we know that we can get out of this but it's going to be a while before
[39:02.280 --> 39:06.880]  things go back to normal media stew but i don't want to hear from those people who are
[39:06.880 --> 39:12.040]  out there protesting with guns right and that is threatening a threatening look for people
[39:12.040 --> 39:17.800]  you're protesting with guns don't don't criticize people who are taking a knee for edit at a
[39:17.800 --> 39:21.880]  ball game and entertainment things that i don't want people protesting at a ball game

[39:31.760 --> 39:37.000]  mad politician untold numbers who gassed up on the way here or grabbed a bite on the way
[39:37.000 --> 39:45.720]  home we know that this rally endangered people reveling in the prospect of order out of chaos
[39:45.720 --> 39:51.840]  how can you do your part to assist in the demise of an entire country on forced lockdown due
[39:51.840 --> 39:57.600]  to the chinese control of iris well this is a good start first you have to separate yourself
[39:57.600 --> 40:03.400]  from the chaff as grenadier time reported set in the director's office of the 270 acre
[40:03.400 --> 40:10.560]  less parsed day centro pay where lvmh luxury group chairman bernard all not ritz paris owner
[40:10.560 --> 40:16.240]  mohammed al-fayed and indian steel magnate like shema mital have palatial fillers the
[40:16.240 --> 40:21.000]  medical unit is staffed with a doctor and lab technician to take and process samples
[40:21.000 --> 40:25.360]  from residents and their friends and if you live in the hamptons you can have a doctor
[40:25.360 --> 40:30.720]  come to your house for just a thousand dollars a visit as millions of average americans lose
[40:30.720 --> 40:36.960]  their jobs the billionaire class benefits as fast company reported though the corona
[40:36.960 --> 40:42.680]  virus itself may not discriminate in terms of who can be infected the kovat 19 pandemic
[40:42.680 --> 40:48.360]  is far from a great equalizer in the same month that 22 million americans lost their
[40:48.360 --> 40:55.200]  jobs the american billionaire classes total wealth increased by about 10 percent or 282
[40:55.200 --> 41:00.800]  billion dollars more than it was at the beginning of march they now have a combined net worth
[41:00.800 --> 41:07.640]  of 3.23 trillion dollars of course the populace must be controlled and called as was written
[41:07.640 --> 41:12.800]  on the georgia guide stones silicon valley will continue to do its part to censor any
[41:12.800 --> 41:18.240]  dissent while using their digital hurting platforms to monitor every life choice that
[41:18.240 --> 41:24.240]  the imprisoned populace makes while the 5g grid rolls out and low atmosphere satellites
[41:24.240 --> 41:29.360]  are positioned to aid in the bill gates mark of the beast mandatory vaccination scenario
[41:29.360 --> 41:34.880]  one where another everyone will be forced to submit their individuality to the panopticon
[41:34.880 --> 41:40.000]  and those that don't will become societal pariahs that will be cut off from the state
[41:40.000 --> 41:45.600]  whether if it's by a chip under the skin or a tattoo on top of it as science alert reported
[41:45.600 --> 41:50.880]  for the people overseeing nationwide vaccination initiatives in developing countries keeping
[41:50.880 --> 41:57.120]  track of who had which vaccination and when can be a tough task researchers from mit might
[41:57.120 --> 42:02.160]  have a solution they've created an ink that can be safely embedded in the skin alongside
[42:02.160 --> 42:08.160]  the vaccine itself and it's only visible using a special smartphone camera app and filter
[42:08.160 --> 42:12.880]  or we could just give them all chips in the head of course it's key that currency becomes
[42:12.880 --> 42:19.360]  digital as china is doing working with us multinationals as forbes reports china the country
[42:19.360 --> 42:25.040]  that banned initial coin offerings and made it tough for bitcoin to operate has been tossing
[42:25.040 --> 42:31.280]  around the idea to build its own digital currency and some us multinationals are reportedly willing
[42:31.280 --> 42:37.280]  to help roll it out the south china morning post reported many american politicians will do their
[42:37.280 --> 42:42.640]  due diligence after being paid off by foreign entities to ignore the very laws of their land
[42:42.640 --> 42:48.480]  as california is doing for example as jaymey white reported california governor gavin newson
[42:48.480 --> 42:54.160]  awarded a chinese communist party linked company one billion in taxpayer funds in exchange for
[42:54.160 --> 43:00.960]  200 million protective mass newson signed a pqq research that look into it for yourself
[43:01.600 --> 43:06.400]  big brother and the globalists don't want you to coq 10 oh you probably want to spend some time
[43:06.400 --> 43:14.320]  researching coq 10 and then research dna force plus and the types that meet heaven here the very
[43:14.320 --> 43:23.200]  best forms of the pqq and coq and then a whole bunch of other natural ingredients for mother nature
[43:23.200 --> 43:30.560]  that are known to supercharge it all this is our best selling overall formula and i've told
[43:30.560 --> 43:35.920]  listeners at the end of last year that we can't sell products at 50% off anymore because there's
[43:35.920 --> 43:41.200]  not enough markup in them to fund our operations but because of what's happening and going on in
[43:41.200 --> 43:48.080]  the world right now i really want everybody who hasn't used or tried or enjoyed the benefits of
[43:48.080 --> 43:55.440]  dna force plus to have dna force plus for yourself and your family dna force plus now 50% off
[43:58.080 --> 44:04.480]  now that this un global government shy calm bill will indicates medical tyranny has seen how
[44:04.480 --> 44:12.000]  far they can push it now we just lapped it up like like poison you know now they're gonna launch
[44:12.000 --> 44:19.280]  more bio attacks they're even more hardcore this early one does kill people but see it's a virus
[44:19.280 --> 44:25.280]  bill will indicates own it's a virus that that's novel from others so they can give you a vaccine
[44:25.280 --> 44:30.000]  you see a regular cold or flu virus you really can't do a vaccine for because it's always mutating
[44:30.000 --> 44:37.680]  but see because this is a chimera and lab made they can have a speciality so it's a whole giant
[44:37.680 --> 44:42.640]  franchise they get filthy rich off of it they can assert fail everybody everybody gets to become a
[44:42.640 --> 44:47.120]  suspect and now when you would have low numbers of death it doesn't matter because they make a huge
[44:47.120 --> 44:52.880]  spectacle out of it you watch next year with the flu it'll even be bigger as well this is what
[44:52.880 --> 44:59.120]  they've done to us because we're a bunch of domesticated idiots hiding in plain view
[44:59.120 --> 45:05.520]  politico the associated press you name it admit that a half a billion people extra 500 million
[45:05.520 --> 45:11.040]  are now at the subsistence starvation level on top of all the millions already starving
[45:11.040 --> 45:16.160]  because the global lockdown that is hundreds of times worse than all the deaths in the world
[45:16.160 --> 45:21.040]  caused by covid-19 and the very people that cooked it up and gave it to the chai comms at the world
[45:21.040 --> 45:26.560]  health organization with bill gates involved are now the ones running the operation to shut down
[45:26.560 --> 45:31.360]  society create a depression and forcibly inoculate everybody this is insane ladies and gentlemen
[45:31.360 --> 45:36.160]  they succeed it's over you need to get prepared now you need to get high quality storeable food
[45:36.160 --> 45:41.600]  now back in stock at info war store dot com and you need to get politically active and challenge
[45:41.600 --> 45:46.480]  this verbally everywhere big tech is trying to censor everyone right now and bully people
[45:46.480 --> 45:52.080]  and to send you can't even challenge verbally social distancing this is beyond 1984 the tyranny
[45:52.080 --> 45:57.120]  of the dual orders here get prepared now and spread the word in the info war you are the paul reveres
[45:57.120 --> 46:02.320]  the america that we've known and loved the america that was the land of the free home of the brave
[46:02.320 --> 46:08.880]  is dying right now and everything our enemies are doing is about domesticating us shutting us
[46:08.880 --> 46:13.920]  down and making us dependent on them the food shortages have begun the depression is going
[46:13.920 --> 46:18.400]  to be long and very very serious in fact it's probably too late now to even turn back trump
[46:18.400 --> 46:23.280]  tried to stop it but the mainstream media working with the chai comms blocked it that's why you and
[46:23.280 --> 46:29.040]  myself everybody else has to get prepared now do not wait it's not about the virus it's about the
[46:29.040 --> 46:33.920]  economic chaos that's going to be unleashed in the next six months to a year get your high quality
[46:33.920 --> 46:38.480]  storeable foods and info war short i come they're available again but for a limited time the food
[46:38.480 --> 46:45.440]  supply is running out there are major shortages this is a globalist siege a globalist lockdown
[46:45.440 --> 46:51.120]  globalist terrorism but we the people the patriots have to be prepared we've already been proven right
[46:51.120 --> 46:55.520]  about prepping so far we'll get ready to be really proven right here's formal foods now at info war
[46:55.520 --> 47:25.360]  store dot com you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:25.520 --> 47:37.840]  what is completed it will end the human species forever it's a takeover an attack not of this world
[47:39.360 --> 47:43.200]  all right the crew's doing a great job and that is not theatrics when i'm on air
[47:44.560 --> 47:50.000]  most people that work in government or corporations the media try to just do what the executives want
[47:50.000 --> 47:56.160]  and pair it the same globalist line we built info wars to be independent to be pro truth pro america
[47:56.960 --> 48:02.080]  and because of that we've had all the guests and all the experts and really been immersed for 26 years
[48:02.880 --> 48:09.120]  in research and really know how things work and so it's natural cause and effect or
[48:09.920 --> 48:16.240]  particles attracting each other that the military and the intelligence agencies the white hats and
[48:16.240 --> 48:20.640]  the people in the white house do watch and listen to the show and
[48:26.240 --> 48:31.520]  being connected at that level and then connect with the level of reality that i'm at and able
[48:31.520 --> 48:36.960]  to analyze everything that's going on i have discovered things that i had a good idea were
[48:36.960 --> 48:43.840]  going on but the true magnitude of it is so disgusting that i become enraged i mean i've
[48:43.840 --> 48:50.000]  done hours of research last night hours and hours of research today i have devastating
[48:50.000 --> 48:59.760]  devastating information and it's and and and there's so much of it that you look at it you're
[48:59.760 --> 49:09.280]  like how the hell did we allow this to happen and then when you find out how real the president is
[49:09.280 --> 49:18.640]  and how isolated he is because of cowardice by the people around him it's insane roger stone
[49:18.640 --> 49:24.000]  advised the president gave him good advice he's facing prison general flinn advised the president
[49:24.000 --> 49:29.120]  gave him good advice he's facing prison i gave the president good advice i'm facing same thing
[49:29.120 --> 49:34.880]  right now okay it'll be out soon that's how this works and these people target you and they let you
[49:34.880 --> 49:41.120]  know and they operate with impunity folks because the government is so full of cowards and social
[49:41.120 --> 49:50.480]  climbers but i can tell you i could look at how the tea leaves break they're never going to get
[49:50.480 --> 49:55.360]  away with this now that people are awake it's it's just going to be a disaster it's going to be a
[49:55.360 --> 50:04.240]  train wreck this is beyond a mexican standoff and i've got will to fight and will to stand up and
[50:04.240 --> 50:09.360]  will to speak out i have plenty of courage but at the same time it's very demoralizing to see
[50:09.360 --> 50:17.920]  how far our country's fallen because it should be so easy to beat this if this country had backbone
[50:17.920 --> 50:25.520]  and the average person didn't live in a fantasy world and you know that's really it is more
[50:25.520 --> 50:30.880]  people wake up the globalists know their time is over let me do this i'm on a regroup because i was
[50:30.880 --> 50:36.240]  so loaded for bear i had we did a great job the first 30 minutes then i went sideways we've been
[50:36.240 --> 50:45.280]  hearing some incredible reports though i never air the same report in the same hour but i might do
[50:45.280 --> 50:51.440]  it right now this john bound report is as good as anything i've ever seen it's so dead on the globalist
[50:51.440 --> 50:55.840]  guide to crush in the united states that's the name of the live feed today too but under the live
[50:55.840 --> 51:02.000]  feed the show at info wars dot com is that video he put together that report and watching that
[51:03.200 --> 51:05.920]  this morning and then watching it again when we aired it i i just
[51:09.040 --> 51:14.800]  my brain just shut off and said this isn't talking information this is fighting information
[51:14.800 --> 51:25.920]  and then bill gates prancing around saying that we're never reopen and and all of this crap
[51:26.720 --> 51:31.360]  and then knowing that they coded this virus to come up false positive with anybody that
[51:31.360 --> 51:36.720]  ever had a cold in the last couple years you have the genetic material of that fight
[51:37.600 --> 51:43.520]  in you that they can then say everyone suspects they needed a virus that infects everyone and
[51:43.520 --> 51:48.720]  yes they've got some varieties of it that do come back and do attack the brain and the testicles
[51:48.720 --> 51:55.040]  not just the lungs so there's a twist to covet because now they did the drill locking us down
[51:55.040 --> 52:00.240]  with a weaker version they're already releasing stronger versions but they're gauging and it's
[52:00.240 --> 52:06.160]  all scientific test we're all in a big planetary laboratory and and now as it fully comes into
[52:06.160 --> 52:15.520]  view and now it does tie in with electromagnetic radiation it's just unbelievable i mean i am
[52:15.520 --> 52:22.160]  grieving every millisecond right now and i've never been guilty i had children because i knew
[52:22.160 --> 52:28.000]  that you know it's doubled double down on things trust in god and i do trust in god but i i just
[52:29.280 --> 52:34.880]  look at how many truly evil people there are and it just blows my mind that our species is so turned
[52:34.880 --> 52:42.880]  over to destructive impulses but i'm gonna do this now because i've got to worry about the
[52:42.880 --> 52:47.440]  future and keeping us here on air plus we've got products you really need if you don't get
[52:47.440 --> 52:52.720]  swarable food down you're completely insane the new world order wants to make you dependent they
[52:52.720 --> 52:57.360]  want to shut down food production it's already out in the news that food production is breaking
[52:57.360 --> 53:03.280]  down across the board the food supply chain is breaking tyson says it as plants close i mean
[53:03.280 --> 53:07.440]  it's it's it's everywhere the pension funds are going to go belly up the states are going to go
[53:07.440 --> 53:13.440]  belly up uh the it's all going down by design this is the new order takeover they were always
[53:13.440 --> 53:18.400]  planning it but now they're launching it ahead of schedule because of our counter strike with
[53:18.400 --> 53:23.760]  nationalists like balasaro and trump and the briggs it i mean we've been winning the battles
[53:23.760 --> 53:31.280]  lately so they've launched their full counter strike and it's symbiotic we need my to stay on
[53:31.280 --> 53:35.360]  air and you're insane if you don't have swarable food and we've got the highest quality that's

[59:44.880 --> 59:53.680]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:00:00.800 --> 1:00:02.480]  imagine if you were alive
[1:00:05.120 --> 1:00:07.360]  when hitler was killing tens of millions of people
[1:00:07.360 --> 1:00:15.440]  russians, poles, jews, germans you name it imagine if you were alive many of you were
[1:00:16.000 --> 1:00:22.880]  when mausik tong was killing 85 million of his own people he admitted by the 1970s from 1949 to then
[1:00:24.560 --> 1:00:29.040]  we have a time to change this now the globalists are launching their attack
[1:00:30.720 --> 1:00:35.120]  they've been caught red-handed they didn't even cover their tracks they were so desperate in doing
[1:00:35.120 --> 1:00:41.520]  this word mongton joins us in an hour he'll detail the real human death toll but if you don't
[1:00:41.520 --> 1:00:47.520]  empathize with the 30 million people starving to death right now that's triple what it would have
[1:00:47.520 --> 1:00:52.320]  been currently 10 million still unacceptable then you have no empathy and you're insane i know you
[1:00:52.320 --> 1:00:58.160]  care here's a special report from john bound if you are a globalist technocrat i wish i could say
[1:00:58.960 --> 1:01:03.760]  that we're halfway through but i don't think so it takes time to make a vaccine there's a lot
[1:01:03.760 --> 1:01:09.520]  about the disease we don't understand we know that we can get out of this but it's going to
[1:01:09.520 --> 1:01:14.720]  be a while before things go back to normal medias dude but i don't want to hear from those people
[1:01:14.720 --> 1:01:20.240]  who are out there protesting with guns right and that is threatening a threatening look for people
[1:01:20.240 --> 1:01:26.480]  you're protesting with guns don't don't criticize people who are taking a knee for edit at a ball
[1:01:26.480 --> 1:01:30.880]  game and entertainment they say i don't want people protesting at a ball game when people who are
[1:01:30.880 --> 1:01:36.160]  peacefully protest don't give me that when you're out there protesting with guns and saying i want
[1:01:36.160 --> 1:01:42.640]  to get back to work i want my liberty even a low level power mad politician untold numbers who gassed
[1:01:42.640 --> 1:01:50.880]  up on the way here or grabbed a bite on the way home we know that this rally endangered people
[1:01:50.880 --> 1:01:57.120]  reveling in the prospect of order out of chaos how can you do your part to assist in the demise of
[1:01:57.120 --> 1:02:03.920]  an entire country on forced lockdown due to the chinese control of iris well this is a good start
[1:02:03.920 --> 1:02:09.840]  first you have to separate yourself from the chaff as grenicte time reported set in the director's
[1:02:09.840 --> 1:02:17.120]  office of the 270 acre les pars de centra pay where lvmh luxury group chairman bernard all

[1:02:29.280 --> 1:02:34.160]  from residents and their friends and if you live in the hamptons you can have a doctor come to your
[1:02:34.160 --> 1:02:40.160]  house for just a thousand dollars a visit as millions of average americans lose their jobs
[1:02:40.160 --> 1:02:46.480]  the billionaire class benefits as fast company reported though the coronavirus itself may not
[1:02:46.480 --> 1:02:53.040]  discriminate in terms of who can be infected the covet 19 pandemic is far from a great equalizer
[1:02:53.040 --> 1:02:59.520]  in the same month that 22 million americans lost their jobs the american billionaire classes total
[1:02:59.520 --> 1:03:05.840]  wealth increased by about 10 percent or 282 billion dollars more than it was at the beginning of
[1:03:05.840 --> 1:03:13.680]  march they now have a combined net worth of 3.23 trillion dollars of course the populace must
[1:03:13.680 --> 1:03:19.360]  be controlled and culled as was written on the georgia guide stones silicon valley will continue
[1:03:19.360 --> 1:03:25.360]  to do its part to censor any dissent while using their digital herding platforms to monitor every
[1:03:25.360 --> 1:03:31.760]  life choice that the imprisoned populace makes while the 5g grid rolls out and low atmosphere
[1:03:31.760 --> 1:03:36.800]  satellites are positioned to aid in the bill gates mark of the beast mandatory vaccination
[1:03:36.800 --> 1:03:42.080]  scenario one way or another everyone will be forced to submit their individuality to the
[1:03:42.080 --> 1:03:47.760]  panopticon and those that don't will become societal pariahs that will be cut off from the
[1:03:47.760 --> 1:03:53.760]  state whether if it's by a chip under the skin or a tattoo on top of it as science alert reported
[1:03:53.760 --> 1:03:59.200]  for the people overseeing nationwide vaccination initiatives and developing countries keeping
[1:03:59.200 --> 1:04:05.360]  track of who had which vaccination and when can be a tough task researchers from mit might
[1:04:05.360 --> 1:04:11.040]  have a solution they've created an ink that can be safely embedded in the skin alongside the vaccine
[1:04:11.040 --> 1:04:17.040]  itself and it's only visible using a special smartphone camera app and filter or we could
[1:04:17.040 --> 1:04:22.640]  just give them all chips in the head of course it's key that currency becomes digital as china is
[1:04:22.640 --> 1:04:28.880]  doing working with us multinationals as forbes reports china the country that banned initial
[1:04:28.880 --> 1:04:34.240]  coin offerings and made it tough for bitcoin to operate has been tossing around the idea to
[1:04:34.240 --> 1:04:40.160]  build its own digital currency and some us multinationals are reportedly willing to help
[1:04:40.160 --> 1:04:45.840]  roll it out the south china morning post reported many american politicians will do their due
[1:04:45.840 --> 1:04:51.840]  diligence after being paid off by foreign entities to ignore the very laws of their land as california
[1:04:51.840 --> 1:05:02.080]  is doing for example as jamie white reported what are champions made of here's a man who can show you
[1:05:02.080 --> 1:05:12.720]  I
[1:05:19.920 --> 1:05:26.720]  is
[1:05:56.720 --> 1:06:15.360]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[1:06:15.360 --> 1:06:21.520]  The open assault on free humanity, the fact that it's public, the globalist NIH under
[1:06:21.520 --> 1:06:30.920]  Obama, Fauci, and Hillary Clinton, developed COVID-19 coronavirus, Chimeras, sent it to
[1:06:30.920 --> 1:06:39.080]  Wuhan, then deployed kits that had it infected on it so it would spread it, locked Trump
[1:06:39.080 --> 1:06:44.640]  from blocking the flights, then turned around and said, we've got to lock everything down
[1:06:44.640 --> 1:06:46.360]  to save everybody for two weeks.
[1:06:46.360 --> 1:06:51.600]  We knew it would be a year and a half, then they said, oh, we're never going to unlock
[1:06:51.600 --> 1:06:57.280]  you again, even though Communist China was open for business.
[1:06:57.280 --> 1:07:04.320]  This has all been a giant coming out party for tyrants and all of their agendas being
[1:07:04.320 --> 1:07:07.520]  pushed.
[1:07:07.520 --> 1:07:15.040]  And then President Trump last Thursday gives a press conference, and he says, I've heard
[1:07:15.040 --> 1:07:19.760]  there's UV light they can put down in the body, and also disinfectants, he means zinc
[1:07:19.760 --> 1:07:24.560]  and vitamin C into the blood, Europe's doing that with incredible results, for anybody
[1:07:24.560 --> 1:07:25.560]  to run down.
[1:07:25.560 --> 1:07:30.760]  They are sick because they need zinc and vitamin C, and he looks at the doctors, Fauci and
[1:07:30.760 --> 1:07:39.800]  others all on the Bill Gates payroll, and they don't defend it.
[1:07:39.800 --> 1:07:43.120]  And then the internet goes, well, wait a minute, here's zinc, here's vitamin C, here's the
[1:07:43.120 --> 1:07:44.120]  major studies.
[1:07:44.120 --> 1:07:50.360]  Here's Cedar Sinai, in the last few months, saying they're testing it out and it's working
[1:07:50.360 --> 1:07:56.120]  great putting this cleaned up light, doesn't have UV in it, so it doesn't hurt you, that's
[1:07:56.120 --> 1:08:01.240]  a side effect, and burn yourselves, because it burns viruses too, and bacteria, into the
[1:08:01.240 --> 1:08:09.120]  body, down into the bronchioles, into the lungs, and roll some of that B-roll.
[1:08:09.120 --> 1:08:18.000]  And they then, don't just attack the president and say he's a liar, they take it off YouTube,
[1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:24.520]  then they take it off Twitter, and call it dangerous disinformation.
[1:08:24.520 --> 1:08:31.240]  When Cedar Sinai, other than maybe Mayo Clinic or John Hopkins is the number one hospital
[1:08:31.240 --> 1:08:40.120]  and research hospital in the United States, some argue the world.
[1:08:40.120 --> 1:08:47.120]  Or does Sumner Redstone get his health care, Cedar Sinai?
[1:08:47.120 --> 1:08:51.720]  Where do people like Bill Gates get it, Cedar Sinai, I looked it up.
[1:08:51.720 --> 1:08:58.320]  Bill Gates has a house in LA, just so you go to the hospital there, and one in San Diego.
[1:08:58.320 --> 1:09:05.080]  So the number one research facility in the U.S., arguably, is not allowed to put a video
[1:09:05.080 --> 1:09:09.080]  out or talk to the president, because you see, the globalists are scared, Trump's really
[1:09:09.080 --> 1:09:10.080]  the president.
[1:09:10.080 --> 1:09:13.880]  So he gets briefings, he has a secret service going around the rallies with boxes of what
[1:09:13.880 --> 1:09:20.400]  people hand them, and he demands it on overseas flights, sometimes 15 hours to say Japan, from
[1:09:20.400 --> 1:09:29.240]  DC, and he just reads it, reads it, reads it, reads it, and they cannot stand it.
[1:09:29.240 --> 1:09:30.520]  That's why they hated General Flynn.
[1:09:30.520 --> 1:09:35.440]  He came in, and he said, sir, here's the globalists, here's how they operate, here's the real
[1:09:35.440 --> 1:09:38.840]  geopolitical system, here's who your enemies are.
[1:09:38.840 --> 1:09:43.840]  It was all dead on from an Americana perspective, and that's why they indicted Flynn immediately.
[1:09:43.840 --> 1:09:48.280]  And it turns out the FBI lied on the 302s, and went to set him up, and they lied and
[1:09:48.280 --> 1:09:56.200]  a secret deal with his attorneys to set him up and make him plead guilty.
[1:09:56.200 --> 1:09:59.600]  What do you think happened to Roger Stone?
[1:09:59.600 --> 1:10:02.400]  Because they threaten you, folks, so let me explain something.
[1:10:02.400 --> 1:10:06.000]  If you're a general and you advise Trump good, they're listening to your phones, they start
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:07.640]  threatening you.
[1:10:07.640 --> 1:10:11.800]  And I mean, coming to your house when your wife's there and you're not, they threaten
[1:10:11.800 --> 1:10:14.320]  to cut her head off.
[1:10:14.320 --> 1:10:17.680]  They start going through your bank accounts, they try to find anything, they start sending
[1:10:17.680 --> 1:10:19.800]  you grand jury subpoenas.
[1:10:19.800 --> 1:10:21.360]  That's what they do.
[1:10:21.360 --> 1:10:26.680]  And so Roger Stone advised the president, prison awaits.
[1:10:26.680 --> 1:10:27.680]  Same thing with Flynn.
[1:10:27.680 --> 1:10:33.360]  Even though it came out in the news this week, that the FBI of course lied on the 302s, sent
[1:10:33.360 --> 1:10:39.120]  operatives who weren't even the field agents to go there and set up Flynn, who's a Democrat
[1:10:39.120 --> 1:10:43.920]  and thought they were reasonable, and he thought his lawyers were reasonable, but now you learn
[1:10:43.920 --> 1:10:48.560]  they weren't because the game is rigged now.
[1:10:48.560 --> 1:10:54.080]  Remember two or three years ago, they brought in Kelly to be the head of White House and
[1:10:54.080 --> 1:10:57.840]  it was like the number one mission is to keep Alex Jones and others away from the president.
[1:10:57.840 --> 1:11:05.040]  And that was true because they knew I wasn't just talking to the president.
[1:11:05.040 --> 1:11:12.080]  I was getting briefings to him every two days through Roger Stone and I'm going to leave
[1:11:12.080 --> 1:11:13.080]  it at that.
[1:11:13.080 --> 1:11:16.360]  And of course, I mean, I'm somebody that does what's right no matter how dangerous.
[1:11:16.360 --> 1:11:17.360]  People just couldn't believe it.
[1:11:17.360 --> 1:11:18.640]  They go, dude, they're going to kill you.
[1:11:18.640 --> 1:11:19.640]  You keep doing this.
[1:11:19.640 --> 1:11:20.640]  I mean, you're talking to the president.
[1:11:20.640 --> 1:11:23.800]  Well, let me tell you what's been going on.
[1:11:23.800 --> 1:11:29.720]  The reason they're so pissed at me right now is I contacted four different people that
[1:11:29.720 --> 1:11:38.040]  advise the president daily, Saturday, with the Cedar Sinai video and the fact that it
[1:11:38.040 --> 1:11:39.040]  was being censored.
[1:11:39.040 --> 1:11:43.440]  I don't think you're pulling off Google and YouTube and Facebook and Twitter because
[1:11:43.440 --> 1:11:48.760]  it's most prestigious hospital arguably, but it's in the top five, probably in the
[1:11:48.760 --> 1:11:54.440]  world, not in the US, top two or three in the US is saying exactly what he said.
[1:11:54.440 --> 1:11:59.600]  And we know for damn certain, his advisors set him up and said, oh, this is very promising.
[1:11:59.600 --> 1:12:00.600]  They show it to him.
[1:12:00.600 --> 1:12:03.720]  And when he goes out there, they then don't defend him.
[1:12:03.720 --> 1:12:07.760]  And then he goes, but you sit and then it makes him look stupid.
[1:12:07.760 --> 1:12:11.520]  So see, that's the level of setups going on around the president.
[1:12:11.520 --> 1:12:16.640]  So I began to get this to the president and by the way, I know he's seen it.
[1:12:16.640 --> 1:12:21.600]  I know he's gotten it.
[1:12:21.600 --> 1:12:28.160]  And we'll see how he responds, but it's not that I'm that special.
[1:12:28.160 --> 1:12:34.360]  Everybody else around him, except for a few people will not advise him and will not give
[1:12:34.360 --> 1:12:35.980]  him information.
[1:12:35.980 --> 1:12:43.520]  So again, how real does that say Trump is right there that I can make a few phone calls
[1:12:43.520 --> 1:12:49.480]  and either get a call back or get information directly to the president.
[1:12:49.480 --> 1:12:51.440]  It's not about Alex Jones.
[1:12:51.440 --> 1:12:53.720]  It's about, he goes to rallies.
[1:12:53.720 --> 1:12:56.880]  He tells the Secret Service this, I told you this three years ago, this has been the news
[1:12:56.880 --> 1:12:58.840]  last year that he has boxes.
[1:12:58.840 --> 1:13:00.400]  They go, he's crazy.
[1:13:00.400 --> 1:13:05.520]  He just takes stuff from the general public CNN said, imagine just common people and he
[1:13:05.520 --> 1:13:08.800]  just takes it and reads what they write and notes to him.
[1:13:08.800 --> 1:13:13.440]  And then meanwhile, this is making me like love Trump no matter though he stumbles.
[1:13:13.440 --> 1:13:15.320]  He's fighting folks.
[1:13:15.320 --> 1:13:17.680]  And my heart's like going, bong, bong, bong, bong.
[1:13:17.680 --> 1:13:19.320]  That's exactly what I want to hear.
[1:13:19.320 --> 1:13:29.200]  And they attack him and go, CNN, and I said, let me see, look at the pathetic people.
[1:13:29.200 --> 1:13:34.160]  He tweets, he talked to some lady that gave him his Twitter account.
[1:13:34.160 --> 1:13:40.720]  And then an hour later on the plane, he tweeted her, she had five followers.
[1:13:40.720 --> 1:13:41.720]  Think of the disconnect.
[1:13:41.720 --> 1:13:44.360]  You can pull those articles up.
[1:13:44.360 --> 1:13:47.520]  What is Trump doing, tweeting, nobodies?
[1:13:47.520 --> 1:13:49.840]  What's he doing, talking to?
[1:13:49.840 --> 1:13:53.560]  Well, he learned running golf courses and hotels and buildings.
[1:13:53.560 --> 1:13:56.080]  You better damn well talk to the people.
[1:13:56.080 --> 1:13:58.040]  You better damn well take their notes.
[1:13:58.040 --> 1:14:01.920]  You better damn, you're not going to get told by your chef that they're sold the good food
[1:14:01.920 --> 1:14:04.440]  and they're selling crappy food and ripped you off, you're not going to hear about the
[1:14:04.440 --> 1:14:10.880]  scams unless you're talking to the people because Trump is a service billionaire.
[1:14:10.880 --> 1:14:16.960]  And so he now is in service to us and he loves it and he wants to win.
[1:14:16.960 --> 1:14:20.080]  He doesn't have a heart on for America wanting to screw it.
[1:14:20.080 --> 1:14:21.480]  He wants to empower it.
[1:14:21.480 --> 1:14:25.960]  And they're so pissed, ladies and gentlemen, that he doesn't believe a damn word comes
[1:14:25.960 --> 1:14:28.240]  out of globalist.
[1:14:28.240 --> 1:14:32.600]  But every piece of info I've ever brought, Trump has been golden, so they go, oh, Alex
[1:14:32.600 --> 1:14:37.120]  Jones and Paul Watson gave you that video, doctored of Jim Acosta and Trump goes, that's
[1:14:37.120 --> 1:14:38.120]  not doctored.
[1:14:38.120 --> 1:14:40.720]  They zoomed in on it to help people see what happened.
[1:14:40.720 --> 1:14:41.720]  I was there.
[1:14:41.720 --> 1:14:43.680]  I saw him attack her.
[1:14:43.680 --> 1:14:46.960]  So see, Trump knows that I'm a real channel.
[1:14:46.960 --> 1:14:48.240]  That's all I am.
[1:14:48.240 --> 1:14:54.720]  Just like when he's on the ground, shaking your hands and you pass him a note, he's,
[1:14:54.720 --> 1:14:56.600]  and when he gets on that plane, better than I am.
[1:14:56.600 --> 1:14:58.960]  I try to read the letters come in thousands a week.
[1:14:58.960 --> 1:15:02.920]  It's just like, I don't want to discourage you sending letters, but my God, is that a
[1:15:02.920 --> 1:15:03.920]  job?
[1:15:03.920 --> 1:15:04.920]  Trump is like Superman.
[1:15:04.920 --> 1:15:07.040]  He's at the White House.
[1:15:07.040 --> 1:15:12.160]  He makes them bring him pallets of mail from the warehouse down the road.
[1:15:12.160 --> 1:15:13.440]  And they think he's insane.
[1:15:13.440 --> 1:15:16.360]  And he goes in at night and just just reads it.
[1:15:16.360 --> 1:15:23.280]  And I mean, this guy's, this guy's something special, folks, I gotta tell you.
[1:15:23.280 --> 1:15:26.240]  Trump's had the Secret Service call me, okay?
[1:15:26.240 --> 1:15:27.240]  I mean, I don't know.
[1:15:27.240 --> 1:15:28.240]  It's not about me acting.
[1:15:28.240 --> 1:15:29.960]  Why do they want to kill me, folks?
[1:15:29.960 --> 1:15:31.600]  Because I represent you.
[1:15:31.600 --> 1:15:32.600]  I'm just like you.
[1:15:32.600 --> 1:15:35.920]  I've just got a bigger connection with the president.
[1:15:35.920 --> 1:15:38.080]  And that's why they want him dead.
[1:15:38.080 --> 1:15:42.360]  And that's why they're shutting down now the bad guys at Cedar Sinai.
[1:15:42.360 --> 1:15:43.360]  They're bad.
[1:15:43.360 --> 1:15:44.360]  They're fake news.
[1:15:44.360 --> 1:15:46.240]  That's how evil big tech is.
[1:15:46.240 --> 1:15:51.760]  Not even the chai comms would censor a major hospital, but Twitter and Google sure as hell
[1:15:51.760 --> 1:15:57.480]  did because they backed up the president you know what's really smart wash your hands frequently

[1:18:13.360 --> 1:18:19.240]  they just didn't fail fully open more factories and secured more food so be your orders in
[1:18:19.240 --> 1:18:24.040]  or right now they can take new orders and get it to you quickly they'll probably have
[1:18:24.040 --> 1:18:30.960]  to spend orders very very soon again because the lockdown the economy is killing food distribution
[1:18:30.960 --> 1:18:35.840]  farming you name it and now it's mainstream news the food shortages and delivery are already
[1:18:35.840 --> 1:18:41.760]  starting to happen if Trump can turn the economy back on and rest control of our system away
[1:18:41.760 --> 1:18:45.880]  from the globalist things may be okay but it looks like it's going to get very very
[1:18:45.880 --> 1:18:49.480]  rough so again ladies and gentlemen now is the time to secure the number one thing you
[1:18:49.480 --> 1:18:54.640]  need high quality storeable food ready to get to you and your family now if you get your
[1:18:54.640 --> 1:18:58.360]  orders in the forestore dot com I'm always excited about info wars like products they're
[1:18:58.360 --> 1:19:01.960]  amazing they're cutting edge you love them I love them and they find the info war in
[1:19:01.960 --> 1:19:07.400]  the face of the globalist onslaught but we have come up with a new product over a year
[1:19:07.400 --> 1:19:16.200]  in development that is amazing the only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic
[1:19:16.200 --> 1:19:23.640]  essential oils on top of it and there's another innovation it's spray cap it doesn't just
[1:19:23.640 --> 1:19:30.200]  pour out a bunch of thick gross goo but it's high quality it aerosolizes it in a really
[1:19:30.200 --> 1:19:35.040]  great way I like to put on my hands rub a little bit on my face it's got organic alcohol
[1:19:35.040 --> 1:19:39.400]  in it so spray it around your eyes but I just love it personally has something that's a
[1:19:39.400 --> 1:19:44.480]  moisturizer as well show this is a real innovation I don't know why others think of coming out
[1:19:44.480 --> 1:19:49.560]  with a hand sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it so it doesn't dry you out smells
[1:19:49.560 --> 1:20:01.200]  great it's so refreshing this is a big winner you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:20:01.200 --> 1:20:25.040]  what did the book of Jose say four six King James version my people are destroyed for
[1:20:25.040 --> 1:20:31.560]  lack of knowledge because thou has rejected knowledge I will also reject thee that thou
[1:20:31.560 --> 1:20:38.920]  shout me no priest to me seeing thou has forgotten the law of God I will also forget thy children
[1:20:38.920 --> 1:20:43.880]  so for me it's not a power trip that the president has people listening to show every day a whole
[1:20:43.880 --> 1:20:48.080]  team of people it's not a power trip that when he gets information from me he particularly
[1:20:48.080 --> 1:20:56.760]  goes and looks it up it's a responsibility especially when the straights are so dire
[1:20:56.760 --> 1:21:04.160]  and it's why the last few weeks here on air I've had points where I've never in 26 years
[1:21:04.160 --> 1:21:11.520]  on air not been able to go out and lay out what I know because there's just so much it's
[1:21:11.520 --> 1:21:15.640]  like where do you start well you've got limited time what do you say I know the president
[1:21:15.640 --> 1:21:20.020]  probably has time to watch five minutes what I say a day it's boiled down and if I say
[1:21:20.020 --> 1:21:24.680]  to message the president that they mark that down and give it to him and it's it's not
[1:21:24.680 --> 1:21:29.000]  that I'm choking because I'm not even nervous it's more like my God this is actually a real
[1:21:29.000 --> 1:21:40.960]  president surrounded by criminals and he has to get information from me and then I just
[1:21:40.960 --> 1:21:47.840]  I feel guilty that I haven't done a better job there's only therapy I've got here is
[1:21:47.840 --> 1:21:52.080]  just being honest with you folks I just I've woken up in a Twilight Zone episode and I
[1:21:52.080 --> 1:21:58.120]  know you have to and I just look at the weakness of the average American who I know is strong
[1:21:58.120 --> 1:22:08.680]  we could just wake them up it makes me physically sick because I could talk about news and information
[1:22:08.680 --> 1:22:16.040]  all day if people don't listen what does it matter because if it's just more here's the
[1:22:16.040 --> 1:22:20.920]  problem the universe there's so much information and the globalists put out so much this info
[1:22:20.920 --> 1:22:27.840]  as a fog of war that when the real information comes out people don't know what's real and
[1:22:27.840 --> 1:22:34.600]  the globalists admit they do that on purpose but here's a little trick if they're trying
[1:22:34.600 --> 1:22:39.280]  to keep you from something and trying to keep you from looking it up and trying to keep
[1:22:39.280 --> 1:22:48.160]  you from checking it out then isn't that what you should be looking at I talked to a national
[1:22:48.160 --> 1:22:51.920]  talk show host this morning and I said I know you talked to the president a lot I've already
[1:22:51.920 --> 1:22:55.360]  called some other people I said I could probably try to get a hold of him but I said this is
[1:22:55.360 --> 1:23:00.760]  really important how they're suppressing the senior side I study with the light in the
[1:23:00.760 --> 1:23:04.280]  lungs and I know they advised Trump on that they're setting him up he really needs to
[1:23:04.280 --> 1:23:12.960]  come out with this and there's a great idea already on it and I called another fellow
[1:23:12.960 --> 1:23:17.160]  that's a great a great point I'll get to the president and here's the thing it really gets
[1:23:17.160 --> 1:23:22.680]  to the president so I just want the listeners to understand it's not about Alex Jones being
[1:23:22.680 --> 1:23:26.640]  able to get something the president when I don't talk about this on air for a couple
[1:23:26.640 --> 1:23:32.000]  years oh no I don't talk to the president oh yeah you know hoping the globalists weren't
[1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:41.080]  dumb you know that's a sarcastic response they are dumb and they just can't help the
[1:23:41.080 --> 1:23:49.640]  things they do ladies and gentlemen and that's how Trump is able to trick them in putting
[1:23:49.640 --> 1:23:53.920]  something out there that he knows is true and then having them attack it and he's able
[1:23:53.920 --> 1:23:58.800]  to bring it out that it is true but sometimes that's not what's happening he's being set
[1:23:58.800 --> 1:24:04.280]  up they're telling about promising things he goes out to do a briefing with them and
[1:24:04.280 --> 1:24:07.560]  then they make a huge thing that oh he didn't know what he's talking about because that
[1:24:07.560 --> 1:24:18.760]  was the setup point other big frustration is there's just so much news to hit here I
[1:24:18.760 --> 1:24:23.960]  mean just these three articles right here I should do the whole show on these three
[1:24:23.960 --> 1:24:29.040]  articles read the paragraphs take calls talk about every facet of it that's what a classic
[1:24:29.040 --> 1:24:36.080]  talk show host would take these three articles lawmakers warn coronavirus contact tracing
[1:24:36.080 --> 1:24:43.320]  is ripe for abuse surveillance y'all who knows internet speech will never be back to normal
[1:24:43.320 --> 1:24:53.280]  MSM concerts will never be the same after COVID-19 here's what you should wear to bring
[1:24:53.280 --> 1:25:01.880]  them back a spacesuit all of those articles can be an entire segment of peace us debates
[1:25:01.880 --> 1:25:10.320]  how to quickly reopen oh most Americans carry the coronavirus don't know it yeah we're all
[1:25:10.320 --> 1:25:16.680]  suspects I mean that the problem is I've looked at almost all these articles read most of
[1:25:16.680 --> 1:25:28.920]  it it's just like the frustration is incredible but I'll tell you what I'll do I will come
[1:25:28.920 --> 1:25:38.720]  back and I will hit this stack and then I'll hit this stack because I mentioned this earlier
[1:25:38.720 --> 1:25:45.600]  but you talk about blood boiling we knew weeks ago when we exposed they get $40,000 of bed
[1:25:45.600 --> 1:25:49.320]  for somebody they say has COVID-19 and the test are already predisposed to say anybody
[1:25:49.320 --> 1:25:54.520]  ever had the flu or a coronavirus the last two years says they have it that's now confirmed
[1:25:54.520 --> 1:26:04.960]  if you weren't infected by infected CDC test and to have us say today confirm that they're
[1:26:04.960 --> 1:26:10.320]  doing this and turning away all these people that are dying and then when those people
[1:26:10.320 --> 1:26:18.720]  die here oh here's the big secret they go test their blood and say their COVID-19 and
[1:26:18.720 --> 1:26:25.480]  add them to the list too wow and that's why three weeks ago four weeks ago five weeks
[1:26:25.480 --> 1:26:31.560]  ago for at least five weeks we've had guests on and shown you clips of all over Europe
[1:26:31.560 --> 1:26:38.080]  the US empty hospitals but local newscast saying they're full of people everyone's dead inside
[1:26:38.080 --> 1:26:43.360]  body bags everywhere you go there no one's there now they have to admit okay the hospitals
[1:26:43.360 --> 1:26:49.240]  are empty actually and this is killed as much as a bad flu and then when you learn they're
[1:26:49.240 --> 1:26:53.820]  adding everybody that died from the flu everybody that died from the regular cold who was super
[1:26:53.820 --> 1:26:59.520]  old and sick to it you're like oh my god it's a hoax but wait why is it a bio weapon because
[1:26:59.520 --> 1:27:05.720]  they own it they had to patent it and create something new to finally have a new alien
[1:27:05.720 --> 1:27:13.200]  bug they own so they can now release new versions of it instead of new windows gates gives you
[1:27:13.200 --> 1:27:19.840]  the new bio weapon you understand I'm saying stuff here they'll probably kill me for right
[1:27:19.840 --> 1:27:26.000]  I mean this is what they're doing so you're like oh COVID-19 is not a problem Bill Gates
[1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:34.240]  knows next year the year after that that they're gonna release a COVID that is gonna be super
[1:27:34.240 --> 1:27:38.160]  deadly because it is a chimera it does eat your brain it eats your lungs it eats your
[1:27:38.160 --> 1:27:45.240]  testicles and it's coming for you so everybody laughing now saying it's not a big deal because
[1:27:45.240 --> 1:27:49.600]  this is just phase one hysteria dog training lock yourself down your house do what you're
[1:27:49.600 --> 1:27:53.680]  told so when the real attack comes a lot of planners are worried that people are gonna
[1:27:53.680 --> 1:28:00.280]  get hysterical and burn down all the cities when everybody's actually dying give you an
[1:28:00.280 --> 1:28:05.720]  example that we come back on the other side very macabre so this is just shelter in place
[1:28:05.720 --> 1:28:09.400]  like they tell you I grew up in Dallas and all the underground parking garages shit this
[1:28:09.400 --> 1:28:13.600]  is your nuclear fallout shelter so I'm you're just posting you know you hear the nukes are
[1:28:13.600 --> 1:28:17.960]  coming 10 minutes you go in there and starve to death and the parking garage well it's
[1:28:17.960 --> 1:28:26.320]  the same thing you just go into your little house and you just want Netflix and it'll
[1:28:26.320 --> 1:28:30.480]  tell you to stay there and the drones will come by and drop medicine but you're dead
[1:28:30.480 --> 1:28:35.680]  well I'm not gonna sit here and take it so remember I've got their plan they hate it
[1:28:35.680 --> 1:28:41.720]  I advise the president they can't stop us and long after I'm settled in my grave you can
[1:28:41.720 --> 1:28:46.920]  save this on a on a memory stick so when they're killing you get this out there's still time
[1:28:46.920 --> 1:28:56.600]  to stop them in the future only in the future we lost this round hi I'm Dan Pilla I started

[1:30:06.680 --> 1:30:10.600]  in this world we live together and I understand what comes around goes around your report you
[1:30:10.600 --> 1:30:15.520]  so and I live that and I fundamentally the cellular level understand it now if I would
[1:30:15.520 --> 1:30:20.760]  have hyped up the virus was gonna kill 3 4 5 million people like the UN did I live as
[1:30:20.760 --> 1:30:25.840]  cold five times more supplements but you know what I didn't do that but I said on a routine
[1:30:25.840 --> 1:30:31.520]  basis regardless people are vitamin D deficient people are deficient I had I had so many other
[1:30:31.520 --> 1:30:36.640]  issues you need those products regardless so we started selling out about a mineral
[1:30:36.640 --> 1:30:43.160]  fusion all the other products I cut the prices from 30% off to 60% off because I knew it
[1:30:43.160 --> 1:30:48.040]  was the right thing to do during a crisis to make sure people were incentivized to up
[1:30:48.040 --> 1:30:52.840]  their bodies offenses but now I'm telling you with economic crisis going on get your
[1:30:52.840 --> 1:31:01.000]  store of food now globalism is all about making the nation state and the population itself
[1:31:01.000 --> 1:31:08.960]  obsolete non essential that's why they position it with economic tariffs taxes and controls
[1:31:08.960 --> 1:31:14.600]  to our family farms and industry that's based the United States has to shut down or be part
[1:31:14.600 --> 1:31:21.200]  of a large corporate conglomerate that's part of making us obsolete so that as the human
[1:31:21.200 --> 1:31:27.440]  world is phased out they can simply look at us and say because again you are not essential
[1:31:27.440 --> 1:31:32.320]  that's what the robots and all of this is about it's about setting it up where we're
[1:31:32.320 --> 1:31:38.480]  no longer in charge of our lives we can be told to stay on our houses natural shut up
[1:31:38.480 --> 1:31:43.160]  this world doesn't belong to people anyways it belongs to the new AI gods the rich elitist
[1:31:43.160 --> 1:31:48.080]  that emerged with machines yeah that sounds completely insane doesn't it that's actually
[1:31:48.080 --> 1:31:54.080]  the public plan they're pushing these people are completely psychotic and make Hitler look
[1:31:54.080 --> 1:32:03.320]  like a choir boy allergies dander asthma germs toxins there are many reasons why we need
[1:32:03.320 --> 1:32:08.280]  to think about what is really in the air around us we may not be able to stop breathing but
[1:32:08.280 --> 1:32:13.320]  we can't control what's in the air we breathe the revolutionary alexa pure breeze air filtration

[1:32:59.640 --> 1:33:18.560]  to the alex jones show crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones coming
[1:33:18.560 --> 1:33:27.400]  to you live from the front lines of the info president trump is not an idiot so far but
[1:33:27.400 --> 1:33:36.320]  he is a genius so far but he does have so far like characteristics he learns things
[1:33:36.320 --> 1:33:44.440]  very very quickly he takes in all information but sometimes he seems disconnected from the
[1:33:44.440 --> 1:33:48.440]  general public because they're not at that level a person who is highly knowledgeable
[1:33:48.440 --> 1:33:55.160]  about one subject but knows little about anything else so i would call him a full spectrum so
[1:33:55.160 --> 1:34:03.400]  far but it looks like when you're talking to trump that he's not listening to you but
[1:34:03.400 --> 1:34:10.160]  that's not what he's doing he's accessing his full subconscious mind trump is probably
[1:34:10.160 --> 1:34:16.400]  the smartest person on the planet now the problem is he can only focus on certain things
[1:34:16.400 --> 1:34:21.920]  at a time he is a savant so they know to keep his attention away from stuff because they
[1:34:21.920 --> 1:34:26.480]  can bring him a problem even the bad guys can and he'll have the answer so that's why
[1:34:26.480 --> 1:34:32.240]  they're like don't let jones or anybody else nearing because i bring him questions with
[1:34:32.240 --> 1:34:39.640]  data that he then scans with all of his data and trump goes let's just say i'm a key that
[1:34:39.640 --> 1:34:43.600]  goes in the trump lock and i'm not saying i bet you he's catching you know what i mean
[1:34:43.600 --> 1:34:51.760]  the point is is that this is on record okay you're the key that goes in the lock and
[1:34:51.760 --> 1:35:00.360]  trumps the key that goes in the lock vice versa but that's why they're so pissed so once
[1:35:00.360 --> 1:35:07.080]  trump was explained all of this because again he kind of got recruited to run for president
[1:35:07.080 --> 1:35:11.040]  he believed to make the economy great he understood economics he understood that we've been set
[1:35:11.040 --> 1:35:17.080]  up to fail he said i can reboot america this will be an easy job he just thought other
[1:35:17.080 --> 1:35:24.480]  people wanted success because one blind spot of a true savant i mean he is a savant savant
[1:35:24.480 --> 1:35:29.000]  a full spectrum savant which is the oxymoron of a savant he is trump is a full spectrum
[1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:33.440]  savant most savans are good at mathematics so they're good at art or they're good at
[1:35:33.440 --> 1:35:42.680]  music no no no trump is a savant of savant but he still has the failing limited field
[1:35:42.680 --> 1:35:51.880]  scan value so you've got to get in his narrow field when he can look into any field but
[1:35:51.880 --> 1:36:00.360]  he's got to look at it to give the answer and that's why they're so pissed and now only
[1:36:00.360 --> 1:36:09.200]  now do i see the whole picture because we're in entering the end game that's how this works
[1:36:09.200 --> 1:36:18.600]  now imagine what happens when the american people combine with something like that that's
[1:36:18.600 --> 1:36:23.360]  really what the establishment fears most because there are a lot of other people that could
[1:36:23.360 --> 1:36:29.680]  give trump good advice they've all been taught you give data to the big cheese you get destroyed
[1:36:29.680 --> 1:36:37.520]  because the last thing they want is trump is a very person person is a person who knows
[1:36:37.520 --> 1:36:42.720]  what they're talking about giving a message to trump because he does that instant scan
[1:36:42.720 --> 1:36:48.120]  that shallow deepness and mirrors his own data and when he knows it's right he makes
[1:36:48.120 --> 1:36:54.560]  that decision that is outside of the committees of the globalists that are the opposite of
[1:36:54.560 --> 1:37:04.960]  a savant thinking system they're just committees of kind of psychotic mathematical laborious
[1:37:04.960 --> 1:37:14.400]  business so let's get into it right now look at this little juicy that just broke and then
[1:37:14.400 --> 1:37:20.120]  i've got a special report i'm about to play from the movie contagion where the bad guy
[1:37:20.120 --> 1:37:24.480]  warns everybody the vaccine's tainted and he sells supplements so he causes the earth
[1:37:24.480 --> 1:37:30.720]  to die and you see that the lockdown cities and all the precursors and the conditioning
[1:37:30.720 --> 1:37:35.680]  u.s. says will not take part in w.h.o. drug trials vaccine initiative launch which we
[1:37:35.680 --> 1:37:39.800]  know is going to have covered 19 in it roiders the united states after china already hit us
[1:37:39.800 --> 1:37:43.160]  with contaminated tests will not take part in the launching the global initiative on
[1:37:43.160 --> 1:37:46.880]  friday to speed the development production and distribution of drugs and vaccines against
[1:37:46.880 --> 1:37:52.480]  cover 19 a spokesperson of the u.s. mission in geneva told roiders there will be no u.s.
[1:37:52.480 --> 1:37:56.920]  official participation he said an email reply to the query we look forward to learning more
[1:37:56.920 --> 1:38:01.560]  about this initiative in support of international operations develop a vaccine for cover 19
[1:38:01.560 --> 1:38:05.920]  u.s. president trump has announced a suspension of funding for the world health organization
[1:38:05.920 --> 1:38:10.560]  where it is the largest donor french president immanuel micron and german chancellor merkel
[1:38:10.560 --> 1:38:16.400]  will help launch the initiative friday a un health agency said yeah more and old trumps
[1:38:16.400 --> 1:38:22.560]  for real cut the funding for the w.h.o. pull ourselves out of the new order now before it's
[1:38:22.560 --> 1:38:27.360]  too late there is trump understanding it's about global government creating a global
[1:38:27.360 --> 1:38:32.200]  crisis so they have a global solution with the very groups involved now under criminal
[1:38:32.200 --> 1:38:41.720]  investigation below melinda gates the woon facility fouchy trump gets up to speed he
[1:38:41.720 --> 1:38:45.680]  hasn't looked at fouch he hasn't looked at gates he hasn't looked at he knows in big
[1:38:45.680 --> 1:38:50.640]  general terms what he decided to do but now they're under him attacking him and he's like
[1:38:50.640 --> 1:39:00.160]  now he's like now beginning to announce to the enemy their main organizational system
[1:39:00.160 --> 1:39:05.840]  their chart starts at w.h.o. that's the scientific satanic eugenics dictatorship those down to
[1:39:05.840 --> 1:39:11.960]  gates eugenics groups all of them i mean i personally talked to some very high level
[1:39:11.960 --> 1:39:18.120]  people and i told them all of this just days ago over the phone now you can imagine what
[1:39:18.120 --> 1:39:24.840]  they do target right on me let's see that's a two-way street the target the cross i'm
[1:39:24.840 --> 1:39:29.760]  in god's hands now i just want listeners to know that if i get obliterated very very
[1:39:29.760 --> 1:39:34.680]  soon it's okay because now i realize my main mission i didn't understand trump didn't have
[1:39:34.680 --> 1:39:38.520]  any advisors telling him this i never do my real power was not even talking to the general
[1:39:38.520 --> 1:39:42.640]  public which is a big one we thought that when i actually tried to communicate with
[1:39:42.640 --> 1:39:48.160]  the president was like the ship's going kind of like this i was telling the crew like is
[1:39:48.160 --> 1:39:54.280]  this like the running man or not the running man is this like what's that movie total recall
[1:39:54.280 --> 1:39:59.000]  where you plug into the matrix and you're saving mars but really it's all hallucination but
[1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:02.920]  let's play this short clip here as we go to break and i'll come back with who our real
[1:40:02.920 --> 1:40:08.800]  enemy is and more this is from contagion 11 years ago pre-programming you for martial
[1:40:08.800 --> 1:40:13.520]  law and in the full movie it's those that don't take vaccines the problems and vitamins
[1:40:13.520 --> 1:40:19.880]  and minerals are the criminals i agree with them do not take vitamin c do not take vitamin
[1:40:19.880 --> 1:40:26.120]  d do not take anything just just you don't need food you need vaccines humans live by
[1:40:26.120 --> 1:40:31.160]  vaccines alone here it is
[1:40:31.160 --> 1:40:39.000]  this is a groundbreaking ceremony for a new factory did you mention seeing anyone who
[1:40:39.000 --> 1:40:49.200]  was sick anyone on a plane the airport no she said she was jet lagged the average person
[1:40:49.200 --> 1:40:54.560]  touches their face three to five times every waking minute in between we're touching doorknobs
[1:40:54.560 --> 1:41:00.200]  water fountains and each other bet no no go up to your room honey so we have a virus
[1:41:00.200 --> 1:41:11.240]  no treatment protocol and no vaccine at this time you had a seizure this morning as of

[1:41:42.760 --> 1:41:48.080]  so we just need to know which direction on day one there were two people and then four

[1:42:55.200 --> 1:43:00.040]  weeks ago i began to tell listeners that they needed to get high quality storeable food not
[1:43:00.040 --> 1:43:05.560]  because of the virus but because of the crises in the economic shutdown it would cause because
[1:43:05.560 --> 1:43:09.960]  the globalist were planning to hold america hostage and run a blockade through the blue
[1:43:09.960 --> 1:43:15.280]  cities and blue states now that prediction has come true because the globalist are running
[1:43:15.280 --> 1:43:22.240]  an operation it's not predictions we have their battle plans so going back more than
[1:43:22.240 --> 1:43:26.840]  eight weeks ago all major storeable food companies were sold out except my patriot supply because

[1:45:17.400 --> 1:45:32.400]  I am the leader of Cobra that foresaw your inner cowardice, and how much you enjoyed watching Netflix and wearing masks in clubs when you went out, to feel all important like you were in a war.
[1:45:32.400 --> 1:45:46.400]  With the real time that of Cobra was always the billions of people at the edge of starvation who were about dying at the tune of over a million people every three weeks.
[1:45:46.400 --> 1:45:54.400]  Cobra thanks you for what you've done. Continue the lockdowns while I depopulate the planet. Hail Cobra!
[1:45:54.400 --> 1:46:01.400]  There's a process where you take a stallion and you tie him down, you cut his testicles off, and then he becomes gelted.
[1:46:01.400 --> 1:46:06.400]  Well, that's what's happening to the entire world right now. We're going into deep, deep tyranny.
[1:46:06.400 --> 1:46:19.400]  It's like North Korea and China are going into deep tyranny as well. It's all directed by the UN. It's all a big, cooked up, giant plan to absolutely take control of your life, bankrupt the economy, and make you dependent on the big mega banks.
[1:46:19.400 --> 1:46:26.400]  And to get your universal income, you're going to have to take the inoculations, brainwash your kids the way they say and have absolutely no freedom.
[1:46:26.400 --> 1:46:34.400]  And it's all happening, boom, overnight. This is a giant revolution. And as soon as you put the handcuffs on, they said, oh, it's just an extended spring break, two weeks.
[1:46:34.400 --> 1:46:42.400]  Notice now it's 18 months, two years, five years. It never ends. No one can ever die from a virus again. Government will save you.
[1:46:42.400 --> 1:47:05.400]  It's a takeover. It's the opposite. They're coming with forced inoculations on record. They'll reduce your fertility, lower your immunity, and in many cases kill you, and they're telling you it's going to hurt a lot of people.
[1:47:05.400 --> 1:47:19.400]  I think you can really be a gangster, huh? You got what it takes, huh? Roll with the big boys.
[1:47:19.400 --> 1:47:40.400]  So the left sees me as Godzilla wrapped in Darth Vader. And that's because they believe their own propaganda. All I'm doing is exposing the horrible, assy things they're involved in. And so the devastation that that exposure causes them, they then attribute to me when they're the ones that committed these incredible crimes.
[1:47:40.400 --> 1:47:56.400]  So now they tell me, we're going to kill your ass or put you in prison. And they're trying right now. And I'm just like, okay, you'll still be losers led by the Crip Keeper, Nancy Pelosi, and Hillary, and all these other insane weirdos, and Gigi Ping.
[1:47:56.400 --> 1:48:07.400]  And we're in martial law. We all have to take forced inoculations with the evil elf. Bill Gates hopping around giving speeches about the population. I'm supposed to trust him when they give me a vaccine. Okay, fine.
[1:48:07.400 --> 1:48:24.400]  You can destroy Alex Jones. But all you'll do is water the Tree of Liberty. But that is what Thomas Jefferson said. It's got to be water with the blood of patriots, like Colonel William Barrett Travis, and tyrants.
[1:48:24.400 --> 1:48:39.400]  And the thing about water and trees with patriots blood is it just seems to create a harvest of blood for tyrants. And that's why in the final equation, I'm not worried because I'm right when I'm supposed to be opposing you.
[1:48:39.400 --> 1:48:57.400]  So for myself, the rest of humanity, to all you globalists, you're losers, you're going to fail, humanity's awakening, and you're going to burn it out.
[1:48:57.400 --> 1:49:04.400]  We are back live on this Monday transmission.
[1:49:04.400 --> 1:49:15.400]  President Trump has come out in a major announcement and said Americans will not take the United Nations Bill and Bill Gates vaccine.
[1:49:15.400 --> 1:49:30.400]  They will not submit to the tyranny as Reuters US says will not take part in WHO global drug trials vaccine initiative run by China doesn't trust them.
[1:49:30.400 --> 1:49:43.400]  You know, I just want to say one thing here, because I'm never about celebrating victory. Like the Satanists do, I celebrate life and human will, free will.
[1:49:43.400 --> 1:49:56.400]  That's the prime law. Create free will, create atmospheres of free will, create laboratories of free will to create life and beauty and success.
[1:49:56.400 --> 1:50:03.400]  Satan claims he comes from gives you power from God who suppresses you.
[1:50:03.400 --> 1:50:09.400]  Satan actually is the one suppressing you.
[1:50:09.400 --> 1:50:14.400]  I think the big thing to cover right now is the fact that I'm just so glad that I am a patriot.
[1:50:14.400 --> 1:50:26.400]  And by patriot, I mean, I support human life and justice. And I've gotten to know the people that are pro human and anti death and who believe in humanity.
[1:50:26.400 --> 1:50:31.400]  And that last one is the biggest one, believe in humanity.
[1:50:31.400 --> 1:50:38.400]  Because it's easy to cheat and say it's too hard to be good. It's too hard to try to be a good person. It's too hard to care.
[1:50:38.400 --> 1:50:55.400]  I'm going to screw people over and I'm going to do whatever makes me more successful, even though it dams you and your children to a trillion years of slavery.
[1:50:55.400 --> 1:51:08.400]  Edward Moncton coming up and he was chief science advisor to Margaret Thatcher and he helped engineer very quietly the whole Brexit movement.
[1:51:08.400 --> 1:51:14.400]  And I know he predicted their plan to cut off the economy worldwide and starve over a billion people.
[1:51:14.400 --> 1:51:18.400]  Well, now it's not a theoretical thing on some chalkboard.
[1:51:18.400 --> 1:51:35.400]  And I don't just have empathy for those that are starving to death and dying right now. I know fear of my own soul that if I don't do something to try to stop that, that I just came into God's fist.
[1:51:35.400 --> 1:51:47.400]  And I'm not afraid of the Satanist or president or even death, but I'm afraid of the big guy upstairs because I'm afraid of being cut off.
[1:51:47.400 --> 1:51:52.400]  Like a baby being afraid of being cut off its mother's tit.
[1:51:52.400 --> 1:51:59.400]  I don't want to get caught off from that. I'll do whatever I have to to stay on that because that made all of this. That's what that's who I am.
[1:51:59.400 --> 1:52:04.400]  I want to be with my people, which is you.
[1:52:04.400 --> 1:52:12.400]  And so that's why we've got to get past worrying about how big our car is our houses or how cool everybody thinks we are.
[1:52:12.400 --> 1:52:17.400]  That's all praise of people means nothing.
[1:52:17.400 --> 1:52:24.400]  Start loving God. You'll have the countries, the planets, the worlds, the galaxies, the universes. It'll be a joke.
[1:52:24.400 --> 1:52:34.400]  It'll be like, how do I help people in this? You'll get so much power when you tune into God. You won't even know what to do.
[1:52:34.400 --> 1:52:43.400]  You know, there's a lot of men out there. They tune into who they really were, didn't back down to the globalist. It could probably be a better talk show.
[1:52:43.400 --> 1:52:50.400]  See, they didn't want to take that commission when they had the chance to sign up for it.
[1:52:50.400 --> 1:53:00.400]  They wanted to piss all over it because they could get instant success on this plane with the little creature.
[1:53:00.400 --> 1:53:06.400]  But let's play a few clips here because this is important.
[1:53:06.400 --> 1:53:13.400]  The old Billy Boy Gates. Bill Gates defends communist Chinese government.
[1:53:13.400 --> 1:53:19.400]  His surrogates, who he finances, all the big old monies behind Gates. He's the robber barons, the Nazis.
[1:53:19.400 --> 1:53:23.400]  All these dead people put everything they had into this little piece of crap.
[1:53:23.400 --> 1:53:30.400]  They were like, this is the golden one. This is our Messiah. They're all just like, our power, my full power.
[1:53:30.400 --> 1:53:41.400]  The first tron movie goes, my full systems are yours. I mean, that's this creature.
[1:53:41.400 --> 1:53:48.400]  But nevertheless, that's who he is. The antichrist isn't here yet, but this guy's holding his place for him.
[1:53:48.400 --> 1:53:54.400]  This is a Bill Gates sits in the antichrist chair like, I'm waiting for my daddy to arrive. I'm keeping it warm for him.
[1:53:54.400 --> 1:54:03.400]  He is a placeholder. So let's go now live to Satan's bench warmer. Here it is.
[1:54:03.400 --> 1:54:10.400]  There is right now in Washington a very different mood, which is to say, far from cooperating with the second largest economy in the world,
[1:54:10.400 --> 1:54:15.400]  it is China that is to blame for this virus. You've been following this very carefully.
[1:54:15.400 --> 1:54:20.400]  How would you respond to the charge that, look, the Chinese covered this up.
[1:54:20.400 --> 1:54:27.400]  They essentially deceived the rest of the world. And as a result, they should be held in some way responsible.
[1:54:27.400 --> 1:54:34.400]  Well, I don't think that's a timely thing because it doesn't affect how we act today.
[1:54:34.400 --> 1:54:41.400]  You know, China did a lot of things right. You know, at the beginning, like any country where a virus first shows up,
[1:54:41.400 --> 1:54:46.400]  you know, they can look back and say where they they miss some things. No, it shows up in China.
[1:54:46.400 --> 1:54:55.400]  You know, some countries did respond very quickly and get their testing in place and they avoided the incredible economic pain.
[1:54:55.400 --> 1:55:03.400]  And it's sad that even the US that you would have expected to do this well did it particularly poorly.
[1:55:03.400 --> 1:55:10.400]  But it's not time to talk about that. But this is the time to take the great science we have, the fact that we're in this together.
[1:55:10.400 --> 1:55:21.400]  You know, fix testing treatments and get that vaccine and, you know, minimize the trillions of dollars and many things that you can't even
[1:55:21.400 --> 1:55:29.400]  dimensionalize in economic terms that are awful about the situation that we're in. So that's a distraction.
[1:55:29.400 --> 1:55:34.400]  I think there's a lot of, you know, incorrect and unfair things said, but it's not even time for that.
[1:55:34.400 --> 1:55:43.400]  So they've engineered our collapse. They brag about the CFR will use a bio weapon to kill Trump to kill his success, kill America's success.
[1:55:43.400 --> 1:55:54.400]  And now the very engineer of it is being the guy that gives us hope.
[1:55:54.400 --> 1:56:04.400]  Let's go to Senator Cotton talking about China's deliberate malevolent behavior. Here it is.
[1:56:04.400 --> 1:56:09.400]  So Maria, I want to distinguish between the origins of the virus and China's reactions to the virus.
[1:56:09.400 --> 1:56:19.400]  So right now, as you say, the most plausible explanation supported by literally all of the circumstantial evidence is that the virus originated in one of those two laboratories in Wuhan.
[1:56:19.400 --> 1:56:26.400]  All the way back in January, it was pretty well documented by Chinese scientists that it did not originate in the food market.
[1:56:26.400 --> 1:56:36.400]  But wherever it originated, Maria, we know that the Chinese Communist Party was both criminally negligent and incompetent at first and then deliberately,
[1:56:36.400 --> 1:56:42.400]  deliberately malevolent in the way they responded to this virus for their own people and the world.
[1:56:42.400 --> 1:56:49.400]  As early as the second week of December, it was clear that this virus was spreading from person to person.
[1:56:49.400 --> 1:56:52.400]  By late December, it was spreading to doctors in Wuhan hospitals.
[1:56:52.400 --> 1:56:59.400]  Some doctors were trying to blow the whistle on these facts and the secret police arrived at their doorsteps in the middle of the night.
[1:56:59.400 --> 1:57:05.400]  So only after China fessed up to the WHO on December 31st, did the world know what was happening.
[1:57:05.400 --> 1:57:11.400]  Yet still, they continued to deny that it was spreading from person to person into mid-January.
[1:57:11.400 --> 1:57:14.400]  That allowed millions of people to leave Wuhan.
[1:57:14.400 --> 1:57:22.400]  And then finally, China continued to pressure the WHO and other countries not to stop international travel from China.
[1:57:22.400 --> 1:57:31.400]  That meant that hundreds of thousands of persons left China after this virus was spread far outside of Wuhan, which allowed the virus to escape.
[1:57:31.400 --> 1:57:34.400]  And Pelosi called for Trump not to block it. Now she says it's his fault.
[1:57:34.400 --> 1:57:42.400]  Next hour, Lord Monk is coming up and I'm telling you, we ain't waiting for the new old order folks, it's here.
[1:58:04.400 --> 1:58:11.400]  It's the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males.
[1:58:11.400 --> 1:58:22.400]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[1:58:22.400 --> 1:58:34.400]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology, working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[1:58:34.400 --> 1:58:40.400]  So what are you waiting for? Go to the InforWars store. Never been a better time than right now.
[1:58:40.400 --> 1:58:53.400]  Super male vitality at InforStore.com.
[1:59:11.400 --> 1:59:17.400]  And then our teachers and big tech has been our controllers. We're all being introduced now.
[1:59:17.400 --> 1:59:27.400]  The digital straight jacket that depends on us complying with it and depends on us all henpecking each other into submission.
[1:59:27.400 --> 1:59:32.400]  But for all of you out there that have decided to go along with this, mark your calendars down.
[1:59:32.400 --> 1:59:36.400]  And then in a few months, a few years, look at the world and remember, you did this.
[1:59:36.400 --> 1:59:42.400]  You were the prisoners, you were the sliders, you were the people that crouched down and licked the hand that fed you.
[1:59:42.400 --> 1:59:47.400]  Ask for me, give me liberty or give me death.
[1:59:47.400 --> 1:59:53.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:59:53.400 --> 1:59:55.400]  If you are a globalist technocrat.
[1:59:55.400 --> 1:59:59.400]  I wish I could say that we're halfway through, but I don't think so.
[1:59:59.400 --> 2:00:04.400]  It takes time to make a vaccine. There's a lot about the disease we don't understand.
[2:00:04.400 --> 2:00:10.400]  We know that we can get out of this, but it's going to be a while before things go back to normal.
[2:00:10.400 --> 2:00:16.400]  I don't want to hear from those people who are out there protesting with guns, right?
[2:00:16.400 --> 2:00:20.400]  And that is threatening, a threatening look for people. You're protesting with guns.
[2:00:20.400 --> 2:00:26.400]  Don't don't criticize people who are taking a knee for edit at a ball game and entertainment.
[2:00:26.400 --> 2:00:28.400]  They say, I don't want people protesting at a ball game.
[2:00:28.400 --> 2:00:35.400]  When people who are peacefully protest, don't give me that when you're out there protesting with guns and saying, I want to get back to work.
[2:00:35.400 --> 2:00:37.400]  I want my liberty.
[2:00:37.400 --> 2:00:39.400]  Even a low level power mad politician.
[2:00:39.400 --> 2:00:44.400]  Untold numbers who gassed up on the way here or grabbed a bite on the way home.
[2:00:44.400 --> 2:00:49.400]  We know that this rally endangered people.
[2:00:49.400 --> 2:01:01.400]  Revelling in the prospect of order out of chaos, how can you do your part to assist in the demise of an entire country on forced lockdown due to the Chinese control of virus?
[2:01:01.400 --> 2:01:05.400]  Well, this is a good start. First, you have to separate yourself from the chaff.
[2:01:05.400 --> 2:01:20.400]  As Greenwich Time reported, set in the director's office of the 270-acre Les Pars de Saint-Tropez, where LVMH luxury group chairman Bernard Alnog, Ritz Paris owner Mohamed Al Fayed and Indian steel magnate,
[2:01:20.400 --> 2:01:29.400]  like Shema Mital, have palatial fillers, the medical unit is staffed with a doctor and lab technician to take and process samples from residents and their friends.
[2:01:29.400 --> 2:01:35.400]  And if you live in the Hamptons, you can have a doctor come to your house for just $1,000 a visit.
[2:01:35.400 --> 2:01:40.400]  As millions of average Americans lose their jobs, the billionaire class benefits.
[2:01:40.400 --> 2:01:51.400]  As Fast Company reported, though the coronavirus itself may not discriminate in terms of who can be infected, the COVID-19 pandemic is far from a great equalizer.
[2:01:51.400 --> 2:02:00.400]  In the same month that 22 million Americans lost their jobs, the American billionaire class's total wealth increased by about 10 percent,
[2:02:00.400 --> 2:02:10.400]  or $282 billion more than it was at the beginning of March. They now have a combined net worth of $3.23 trillion.
[2:02:10.400 --> 2:02:26.400]  Of course, the populace must be controlled and culled as was written on the Georgia Guidestones. Silicon Valley will continue to do its part to censor any dissent while using their digital herding platforms to monitor every life choice that the imprisoned populace makes.
[2:02:26.400 --> 2:02:36.400]  While the 5G grid rolls out and low-atmosphere satellites are positioned to aid in the Bill Gates Mark of the Beast mandatory vaccination scenario,
[2:02:36.400 --> 2:02:47.400]  one way or another everyone will be forced to submit their individuality to the Panopticon, and those that don't will become societal pariahs that will be cut off from the state,
[2:02:47.400 --> 2:03:02.400]  whether if it's by a chip under the skin or a tattoo on top of it, as Science Alert reported, for the people overseeing nationwide vaccination initiatives in developing countries keeping track of who had which vaccination and when can be a tough task.
[2:03:02.400 --> 2:03:15.400]  These researchers from MIT might have a solution. They've created an ink that can be safely embedded in the skin alongside the vaccine itself, and it's only visible using a special smartphone camera app and filter,
[2:03:15.400 --> 2:03:25.400]  or we could just give them all chips in the head. Of course, it's key that currency becomes digital, as China is doing, working with U.S. multinationals, as Forbes reports,
[2:03:25.400 --> 2:03:34.400]  China, the country that banned initial coin offerings and made it tough for Bitcoin to operate, has been tossing around the idea to build its own digital currency,
[2:03:34.400 --> 2:03:41.400]  and some U.S. multinationals are reportedly willing to help roll it out, the South China Morning Post reported.
[2:03:41.400 --> 2:03:51.400]  Many American politicians will do their due diligence after being paid off by foreign entities to ignore the very laws of their land, as California is doing, for example,
[2:03:51.400 --> 2:04:03.400]  as Jamie White reported, California Governor Gavin Newsom awarded a Chinese Communist Party-linked company one billion in taxpayer funds in exchange for 200 million protective masks.
[2:04:03.400 --> 2:04:18.400]  Newsom signed a $990 million contract earlier this month with Build Your Dreams, a Chinese electric car company, whose founder, Wang Chan Fu, is a member of the CCP and has served the party in numerous official capacities.
[2:04:18.400 --> 2:04:28.400]  Gradually, if the current coronavirus doesn't force the Americans into trading their liberty for security, we have plenty more pathogens, compromise politicians, media, prostitutes,
[2:04:28.400 --> 2:04:34.400]  and foreign infiltration plan, and that is the globalist guide to crushing the United States.
[2:04:34.400 --> 2:04:49.400]  John Bown reporting.
[2:05:05.400 --> 2:05:10.400]  It's an incredible formula, not just for the prostate, the solpal meadow that's on record.
[2:05:10.400 --> 2:05:20.400]  For helping that, it's got everything, vitamin D, a big dose of that, a big dose of zinc, a big dose of selenium, copper, chromium, and a bunch of other stuff.
[2:05:20.400 --> 2:05:30.400]  This is the perfect formula for what's going on right now, and it's about to sell out in formerstore.com, and I want you to have it so that after all this craziness passes,
[2:05:30.400 --> 2:05:39.400]  it becomes a normal regimen in your life, because it's something, in my view, you need every day. Get it right now, prostigarded, at fullwarstore.com, and whatever you do,
[2:05:39.400 --> 2:06:01.400]  please warn others that Mother Nature has given us a lot of things that really help boost our overall health and wellness.
[2:06:09.400 --> 2:06:21.400]  Well, the staggering nature of the times we find ourselves in is too much for any man or woman to even be able to rise to, except we must rise to the occasion.
[2:06:21.400 --> 2:06:30.400]  We are witnessing powerful forces of corporate globalist tyranny thrust upon the free world.
[2:06:30.400 --> 2:06:41.400]  We are seeing a lockdown that will undoubtedly cause massive death, and I am just honored to have Lord Christopher Monkton here with us today.
[2:06:41.400 --> 2:06:48.400]  Just a week ago, the World Health Organization and the UN Food Program said 30 million extra will starve to death.
[2:06:48.400 --> 2:06:53.400]  Now they're saying the Associated Press honored the 30 million on the brink of starvation.
[2:06:53.400 --> 2:07:05.400]  So you want to talk about not even a million dead from COVID-19, not even 100,000 dead in the United States, and this whole push, it's incredible.
[2:07:05.400 --> 2:07:09.400]  The report is at several big sites. We'll tell you about those in a moment.
[2:07:09.400 --> 2:07:24.400]  Communist China's Crimes Against Humanity did Communist China and the World Health Organization conspire to commit crimes against humanity.
[2:07:24.400 --> 2:07:35.400]  And of course, the leading person exposing the carbon taxes are a plan to shut off the human economy and cause depopulation.
[2:07:35.400 --> 2:07:43.400]  They're now in the news, as you know, Lord Monkton, praising that this has already cut our carbon footprint in half.
[2:07:43.400 --> 2:07:51.400]  Oil isn't zero. Starvation is rampant. We've already seen as many people die as died under the Nazis, basically.
[2:07:51.400 --> 2:07:59.400]  This is an incredible tyrannical revolution. Please decipher it for us as no one else can.
[2:07:59.400 --> 2:08:19.400]  Right. The first thing is that the only reason why this virus got loose is that the Chinese Communist Party, having failed in 2002 to three to notify the world in time of the first of the two SARS viruses,
[2:08:19.400 --> 2:08:35.400]  and having prompted the World Health Organization at that time to rewrite the international health regulations to require reporting of any new pathogen of this kind within 24 hours of its first discovery,
[2:08:35.400 --> 2:08:53.400]  failed to notify the world for six weeks, and even after they had eventually notified the world, they went on lying to the effect that it couldn't pass from human to human for another three crucial weeks.
[2:08:53.400 --> 2:09:05.400]  So they very deliberately disobeyed the international health regulations to which the People's Republic, so called, of China is a signatory.
[2:09:05.400 --> 2:09:14.400]  And they did this for the second time, knowing that they had been censured by the international community the first time.
[2:09:14.400 --> 2:09:34.400]  And this time they allowed somewhere between five and seven million people from the province of Wuhan at Hubei where this virus broke out to travel all over the world before they told the world that many of those travelers were carrying with them
[2:09:34.400 --> 2:09:44.400]  the infection that has now reached.
[2:09:44.400 --> 2:09:47.400]  And what I mean to interrupt you, but we were all there at the time it happened. They would say simultaneously shooting women at checkpoints, welding people in their houses, drones controlling were good.
[2:09:47.400 --> 2:09:54.400]  When Trump said no Chinese flights, he was bad. I'm like, oh my God, they want to chest date. They want to incubate it.
[2:09:54.400 --> 2:10:00.400]  Why would you say shoot women at checkpoints, but then don't stop flights?
[2:10:00.400 --> 2:10:12.400]  Well, I think that the biggest problem that the Chinese Communist Party faced was its own people. They are terrified of the people over whom they so brutally rule.
[2:10:12.400 --> 2:10:27.400]  You have two and a half million Uighur Muslims who are in concentration camps in eastern Tibet, which they now call China, and also in the western provinces of China up there.
[2:10:27.400 --> 2:10:36.400]  They suppressed the Falun Gong brutally. All the Christian churches are effectively controlled by the state.
[2:10:36.400 --> 2:10:45.400]  There is no freedom and the people, as we saw from the Hong Kong protests and the Tiananmen Square protests before that, they want their freedom.
[2:10:45.400 --> 2:11:02.400]  And so the Chinese Communist Party, in order to try to keep them quiet, learned from the mistake that had been made by the Russians who kept their people poor because they didn't allow any form of business to flourish.
[2:11:02.400 --> 2:11:11.400]  China realized that if they wanted to maintain their brutal rule, they couldn't allow the people to become poor as the Russians had become.
[2:11:11.400 --> 2:11:21.400]  So under Xi Jinping, they began to allow small businesses not to be owned by the state and to run themselves privately.
[2:11:21.400 --> 2:11:29.400]  They also established six free enterprise zones, one of which is in Shenzhen, just opposite Hong Kong.
[2:11:29.400 --> 2:11:37.400]  It is now the fastest growing city in the world in which practically all laws and practically all taxes were omitted.
[2:11:37.400 --> 2:11:44.400]  It's kind of cowboy territory. And five-sixth of China's foreign earnings come from those six.
[2:11:44.400 --> 2:11:49.400]  So let's be clear. They create zones of freedom so they can defeat America and the West.
[2:11:49.400 --> 2:11:53.400]  I'm going to just add this because you've been involved with Margaret Thatcher and obviously British...
[2:11:53.400 --> 2:12:03.400]  I tried to get Margaret Thatcher to do the same thing, to reenact the excise bill of 1733, which Robert Walpole, our first prime minister, had first put forward.
[2:12:03.400 --> 2:12:10.400]  It was defeated and that would have created half a dozen enterprise zones in Britain 250, 300 years ago.
[2:12:10.400 --> 2:12:12.400]  But we didn't do that.
[2:12:12.400 --> 2:12:16.400]  Well, that's exactly where I was going with this, but listen to him.
[2:12:16.400 --> 2:12:29.400]  But as I say, China, having set up this arrangement, having made the people prosperous, is now terrified that if it makes any major mistake that will annoy the people,
[2:12:29.400 --> 2:12:36.400]  they will overthrow the regime in the same way as the Russians only a couple of years after the Chernobyl disaster,
[2:12:36.400 --> 2:12:42.400]  caused also by the regime trying to keep quiet and cover something up.
[2:12:42.400 --> 2:12:46.400]  The Chinese are terrified that they too will be overthrown.
[2:12:46.400 --> 2:12:49.400]  So they have been lying about this from the start.
[2:12:49.400 --> 2:12:56.400]  Well, that's my next question. How big is it that Trump and US intelligence and British intelligence, because you're involved with the British.
[2:12:56.400 --> 2:12:59.400]  The British are usually, as you know, the UK is very restrained.
[2:12:59.400 --> 2:13:06.400]  I'm seeing the most hawkish statements out of the UK about you released it, you lied, dev reckoning, you're going to get it.
[2:13:06.400 --> 2:13:07.400]  We know you're behind it.
[2:13:07.400 --> 2:13:08.400]  Talk about cowboy.
[2:13:08.400 --> 2:13:14.400]  This sounds like, you know, I mean, why is British intelligence and the British government so pissed?
[2:13:14.400 --> 2:13:15.400]  Am I wrong?
[2:13:15.400 --> 2:13:18.400]  I've never heard rhetoric like this since Churchill and Hitler.
[2:13:18.400 --> 2:13:24.400]  There is enormous international, to put it mildly, displeasure.
[2:13:24.400 --> 2:13:29.400]  I know there's international, I'm saying some of the loudest voices against China are coming out of the UK.
[2:13:29.400 --> 2:13:33.400]  The UK is usually pretty diplomatic. Why is the UK so pissed?
[2:13:33.400 --> 2:13:38.400]  Boris Johnson is now back having got the Chinese virus himself. He very nearly died of it.
[2:13:38.400 --> 2:13:42.400]  But fortunately survived. He's still not very well, but he's back at work.
[2:13:42.400 --> 2:13:48.400]  And he sets the tone for the government, because most of them are a bit limp-wristed, but he isn't.
[2:13:48.400 --> 2:13:52.400]  And he's very fed up with what China has done.
[2:13:52.400 --> 2:13:58.400]  That was my question. We know it was the UK on kind of a war footing. That shows how serious this is.
[2:13:58.400 --> 2:14:07.400]  Absolutely. I mean, the fact is that we have been cow-towing to and stupidly borrowing from China for decades.
[2:14:07.400 --> 2:14:13.400]  We shouldn't have done, because the money in which they lend us, it's called the Ren Minbi, is a bogus currency.
[2:14:13.400 --> 2:14:15.400]  The internal currency of China that they actually use.
[2:14:15.400 --> 2:14:19.400]  So they're buying up the world with a fiat currency.
[2:14:19.400 --> 2:14:25.400]  So they have this bogus currency, the Ren Minbi, where they can just flick a switch and create money,
[2:14:25.400 --> 2:14:30.400]  which they then, or theoretical money, which they lend to say the British government or the American government.
[2:14:30.400 --> 2:14:32.400]  And we then pretend that this is a loan.
[2:14:32.400 --> 2:14:39.400]  And that means we have to pay interest and eventually the capital on something that they've created from nothing.
[2:14:39.400 --> 2:14:41.400]  We could have done the same for ourselves.
[2:14:41.400 --> 2:14:48.400]  That's how this debt trap diplomacy that China has done has meant that because we owe them so much money,
[2:14:48.400 --> 2:14:52.400]  the left, of course, will never say anything against their fellow communists.
[2:14:52.400 --> 2:15:01.400]  But even center-right, there is concern that if we speak out too much, China will call in its loans and then we'll have to pay them back.
[2:15:01.400 --> 2:15:04.400]  Stay there, because you just hit why I wanted you on.
[2:15:04.400 --> 2:15:07.400]  We're told we're on by China now. It's all fiat.
[2:15:07.400 --> 2:15:13.400]  Trump, I'm not for fiat currency, but if we're going to be ruled by China, I get Trump going, oh yeah, here's our fiat.
[2:15:13.400 --> 2:15:18.400]  That's better than it's our fiat than theirs. Let's just get down to brass tacks.
[2:15:18.400 --> 2:15:22.400]  What England did at the end of World War II, didn't ask for Hitler to do that, had to do it, you're still there.
[2:15:22.400 --> 2:15:26.400]  It's not a good path, but it's better than the Chinese fiat ruling us.
[2:15:26.400 --> 2:15:32.400]  So let's do real politics with Lord Monkton about where the world is and what we're facing.
[2:15:32.400 --> 2:15:34.400]  Because let me tell you, you better choose the side, folks.
[2:15:34.400 --> 2:15:37.400]  You're with the Chai comms or you're with the Anglo-American establishment.
[2:15:37.400 --> 2:15:39.400]  That is the point we've reached right now.
[2:15:39.400 --> 2:15:44.400]  Infowars.com, newswords.com, what's up with that.com with Lord Monkton.
[2:15:44.400 --> 2:16:10.400]  We'll be right back.
[2:16:15.400 --> 2:16:18.400]  Let's face it, even the mainline media is talking about food supply disruptions,
[2:16:18.400 --> 2:16:21.400]  and the growing number of grocery store workers who are becoming sick.
[2:16:21.400 --> 2:16:22.400]  But there's more.
[2:16:22.400 --> 2:16:28.400]  Meatpacking plants are closing, mile-long lines at food pantries, and more farmers now in financial trouble.
[2:16:28.400 --> 2:16:34.400]  The truth is, growing nutrient-dense vegetables this summer may be the single most important thing you do.

[2:17:53.400 --> 2:18:00.400]  Authoritarians across the planet want the power to be able to tell you to stay in your houses and don't leave,
[2:18:00.400 --> 2:18:02.400]  and only go where they tell you to go.
[2:18:02.400 --> 2:18:04.400]  It's called martial law.
[2:18:04.400 --> 2:18:06.400]  It's called living in the authoritarian country.
[2:18:06.400 --> 2:18:07.400]  Everybody knows that.
[2:18:07.400 --> 2:18:09.400]  Everybody understands that.
[2:18:09.400 --> 2:18:12.400]  Democrats have now shown their hands with the deep state,
[2:18:12.400 --> 2:18:15.400]  saying we're going to listen to Fauci and the World Health Organization,
[2:18:15.400 --> 2:18:19.400]  who've done nothing but put out all this fake disinformation so far.
[2:18:19.400 --> 2:18:21.400]  We're not going to listen to the president.
[2:18:21.400 --> 2:18:23.400]  We're not going to listen to Congress,
[2:18:23.400 --> 2:18:27.400]  but that all these other corporations are going to work in tandem with big tech
[2:18:27.400 --> 2:18:30.400]  to surveil and control and keep things shut down.
[2:18:30.400 --> 2:18:34.400]  This is economic warfare, and I know everybody understands that.
[2:18:34.400 --> 2:18:39.400]  The public, with the president and others, need to develop a plan to understand
[2:18:39.400 --> 2:18:42.400]  that this is a global corporate civil war,
[2:18:42.400 --> 2:18:44.400]  and that we're being held hostage,
[2:18:44.400 --> 2:18:48.400]  and this is a mutiny against our country by globalist forces.
[2:18:48.400 --> 2:19:05.400]  The reality of that gives us any chance of defeating it.
[2:19:18.400 --> 2:19:23.400]  With Bill Gates involved, are now the ones running the operation to shut down society,
[2:19:23.400 --> 2:19:26.400]  create a depression, and forcibly inoculate everybody.
[2:19:26.400 --> 2:19:27.400]  This is insane.
[2:19:27.400 --> 2:19:29.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, if they succeed, it's over.
[2:19:29.400 --> 2:19:31.400]  You need to get prepared now.
[2:19:31.400 --> 2:19:35.400]  You need to get high-quality, durable food now back in stock at infowarstore.com,
[2:19:35.400 --> 2:19:39.400]  and you need to get politically active and challenge this verbally everywhere.
[2:19:39.400 --> 2:19:42.400]  Big tech is trying to censor everyone right now and bully people
[2:19:42.400 --> 2:19:45.400]  into saying you can't even challenge verbally social distancing.
[2:19:45.400 --> 2:19:49.400]  This is beyond 1984. The tyranny of the dual orders here.
[2:19:49.400 --> 2:19:51.400]  Get prepared now and spread the word in the info war.
[2:19:51.400 --> 2:20:17.400]  You are the Paul Revere's.
[2:20:17.400 --> 2:20:22.400]  But if a castle your ancestors had built had been captured by someone,
[2:20:22.400 --> 2:20:25.400]  if you recaptured it, you would have more value.
[2:20:25.400 --> 2:20:29.400]  So when I said the Anglo-American establishment against the Chai Khoms,
[2:20:29.400 --> 2:20:33.400]  that doesn't mean the Anglo-American establishment of the last 60 years
[2:20:33.400 --> 2:20:35.400]  that's sold out to globalism.
[2:20:35.400 --> 2:20:40.400]  I speak of the West and of Christendom and of what's left of it,
[2:20:40.400 --> 2:20:43.400]  and now the choice we all have to make.
[2:20:43.400 --> 2:20:47.400]  So Lord Moncton is a great geopolitical scientist, a guy that
[2:20:47.400 --> 2:20:52.400]  exposed the plan to cut off the economy and starve billions from the beginning.
[2:20:52.400 --> 2:20:56.400]  So just instead of getting into China, I should upfront with him
[2:20:56.400 --> 2:20:59.400]  ask about the big 35,000-foot view. Who are the players?
[2:20:59.400 --> 2:21:02.400]  What is this shutdown going to do? Why have they triggered it?
[2:21:02.400 --> 2:21:05.400]  Where is it going and how do we stop it?
[2:21:05.400 --> 2:21:09.400]  Right. Let's be nice to them.
[2:21:09.400 --> 2:21:15.400]  Let us first of all accept that as the head of the International
[2:21:15.400 --> 2:21:19.400]  Virological Institute in South Korea has said,
[2:21:19.400 --> 2:21:23.400]  and that's a UN subsidiary, but actually this is a very good man,
[2:21:23.400 --> 2:21:29.400]  he says that this particular infection is 10 times more infectious
[2:21:29.400 --> 2:21:33.400]  and 10 times more deadly than the flu.
[2:21:33.400 --> 2:21:38.400]  Now admittedly, the most of the dead in us is confined to people
[2:21:38.400 --> 2:21:44.400]  who are over 60 and who suffer from various diseases
[2:21:44.400 --> 2:21:47.400]  that make it easier for the virus to kill them.
[2:21:47.400 --> 2:21:51.400]  Young people, the people who are of working age and children at school
[2:21:51.400 --> 2:21:55.400]  are basically not very much more at risk from this virus
[2:21:55.400 --> 2:21:57.400]  than they would be from flu.
[2:21:57.400 --> 2:22:02.400]  And at first, this was not very well known because so little data
[2:22:02.400 --> 2:22:07.400]  was coming out of China that we didn't know what the pattern of deaths was.
[2:22:07.400 --> 2:22:09.400]  We got some early indications,
[2:22:09.400 --> 2:22:12.400]  but because so much of what comes out of China is simply made up,
[2:22:12.400 --> 2:22:16.400]  we had to wait and find out for ourselves before we could be sure
[2:22:16.400 --> 2:22:18.400]  that this is the case.
[2:22:18.400 --> 2:22:21.400]  Now at the moment, governments, most of whom are scientifically
[2:22:21.400 --> 2:22:25.400]  illiterate in my experience, haven't really understood
[2:22:25.400 --> 2:22:30.400]  that the virus really only kills old and sick people.
[2:22:30.400 --> 2:22:34.400]  And so somebody like me, I'm now a count as an old person,
[2:22:34.400 --> 2:22:37.400]  I don't feel like one, but I count as one.
[2:22:37.400 --> 2:22:43.400]  We are at risk, but I do not require to be protected from my fellow citizens.
[2:22:43.400 --> 2:22:48.400]  If I want to look after myself and isolate myself from them voluntarily,
[2:22:48.400 --> 2:22:50.400]  that is a decision which I can make.
[2:22:50.400 --> 2:22:52.400]  I don't need the government to make it for me,
[2:22:52.400 --> 2:22:55.400]  and nor frankly, does any other citizen need that.
[2:22:55.400 --> 2:23:00.400]  So we have got to the point now where we know enough about this virus
[2:23:00.400 --> 2:23:05.400]  to know that for people of working age, the people that keep the economy going
[2:23:05.400 --> 2:23:08.400]  so that they can pay our handsome pensions,
[2:23:08.400 --> 2:23:11.400]  they can go back to work, please.
[2:23:11.400 --> 2:23:14.400]  There's no longer any need to stop them,
[2:23:14.400 --> 2:23:20.400]  provided that a few very sensible and very straightforward precautions aren't taken.
[2:23:20.400 --> 2:23:23.400]  If you're in a crowded indoor space,
[2:23:23.400 --> 2:23:27.400]  then try to keep your distance from people a little bit,
[2:23:27.400 --> 2:23:32.400]  wear a face covering, doesn't matter very much what it's made of,
[2:23:32.400 --> 2:23:37.400]  because then if you cough or sneeze and you happen to have the virus without even knowing it,
[2:23:37.400 --> 2:23:40.400]  you'll be much less likely to spread it to anybody else.
[2:23:40.400 --> 2:23:43.400]  These are sensible, simple things that even now,
[2:23:43.400 --> 2:23:47.400]  the kind of gauntless government in Britain is still saying,
[2:23:47.400 --> 2:23:50.400]  well, we don't really know whether it's a good idea for people to wear masks.
[2:23:50.400 --> 2:23:55.400]  Just talk to the South Korean head of the Public Health Authority there.
[2:23:55.400 --> 2:23:59.400]  That's a separate man from the head of the International Virological Institute,
[2:23:59.400 --> 2:24:01.400]  but he also is very good at what he's doing.
[2:24:01.400 --> 2:24:04.400]  There's been hardly any infection in South Korea,
[2:24:04.400 --> 2:24:07.400]  because they got on top of it straight away,
[2:24:07.400 --> 2:24:10.400]  tested everyone, isolated the people who got it,
[2:24:10.400 --> 2:24:13.400]  and let everybody else get on with their lives.
[2:24:13.400 --> 2:24:16.400]  So what is the larger agenda saying we can never open,
[2:24:16.400 --> 2:24:18.400]  clearly about getting rid of Trump?
[2:24:18.400 --> 2:24:23.400]  And then Bill Gates on TV saying, don't blame China, it's all Trump's fault.
[2:24:23.400 --> 2:24:27.400]  Well, Bill Gates is a communist sympathizer,
[2:24:27.400 --> 2:24:30.400]  and he has been for many years.
[2:24:30.400 --> 2:24:34.400]  And a lot of these big billionaires find communism attractive,
[2:24:34.400 --> 2:24:38.400]  partly because they see China as a source of revenue.
[2:24:38.400 --> 2:24:41.400]  But he is not to be trusted on this.
[2:24:41.400 --> 2:24:45.400]  The truth is that the people who really know how to deal with this
[2:24:45.400 --> 2:24:47.400]  are the South Koreans and the Taiwanese.
[2:24:47.400 --> 2:24:50.400]  I mean, the Taiwanese, you know, the true government of China
[2:24:50.400 --> 2:24:53.400]  is actually on an island off China's coast.
[2:24:53.400 --> 2:24:55.400]  It's the old nationalist government, the Kuomintang,
[2:24:55.400 --> 2:24:57.400]  that were kicked out by the communists,
[2:24:57.400 --> 2:24:59.400]  but they're still going strong in Taiwan.
[2:24:59.400 --> 2:25:04.400]  And they, the moment they got the first few cases of this virus,
[2:25:04.400 --> 2:25:07.400]  they isolated everyone, tested everyone,
[2:25:07.400 --> 2:25:09.400]  followed up all their contacts,
[2:25:09.400 --> 2:25:11.400]  and shut the epidemic down.
[2:25:11.400 --> 2:25:15.400]  And didn't Xi Jinping use us as a giant power grab?
[2:25:15.400 --> 2:25:17.400]  Didn't Xi Jinping use us as a giant power grab
[2:25:17.400 --> 2:25:20.400]  to shut the Taiwanese protests?
[2:25:20.400 --> 2:25:23.400]  No, I'll tell you what happened there.
[2:25:23.400 --> 2:25:25.400]  We know that the World Health Organization
[2:25:25.400 --> 2:25:29.400]  is a wholly controlled subsidiary of the Communist Party of China.
[2:25:29.400 --> 2:25:30.400]  So talk about it.
[2:25:30.400 --> 2:25:31.400]  Is Trump right to say,
[2:25:31.400 --> 2:25:32.400]  we're going to cut funding,
[2:25:32.400 --> 2:25:34.400]  we're not going to participate in your programs?
[2:25:34.400 --> 2:25:37.400]  Everyone should cut their funding altogether
[2:25:37.400 --> 2:25:39.400]  from the World Health Organization.
[2:25:39.400 --> 2:25:41.400]  It has 7,000 bureaucrats
[2:25:41.400 --> 2:25:44.400]  who spend more than half of the funding they receive
[2:25:44.400 --> 2:25:49.400]  on first-class flights and swank hotels all around the world.
[2:25:49.400 --> 2:25:52.400]  But they were totally unprepared for this pandemic,
[2:25:52.400 --> 2:25:55.400]  and when China lied to them about it,
[2:25:55.400 --> 2:25:57.400]  they did not hold it to account.
[2:25:57.400 --> 2:25:59.400]  Instead, they formed upon it
[2:25:59.400 --> 2:26:02.400]  in the most disgraceful and headbanging way,
[2:26:02.400 --> 2:26:05.400]  and they echoed the lies it was telling
[2:26:05.400 --> 2:26:07.400]  for a fatal reason.
[2:26:07.400 --> 2:26:09.400]  Let's play devil's advocate.
[2:26:09.400 --> 2:26:12.400]  What do you make of Xi Jinping's mouthpieces
[2:26:12.400 --> 2:26:15.400]  saying America is to blame for the virus?
[2:26:15.400 --> 2:26:16.400]  And there's a writer's pull-out.
[2:26:16.400 --> 2:26:19.400]  10% of Americans believe Trump watched it.
[2:26:19.400 --> 2:26:23.400]  No, no, this is a marketing ploy,
[2:26:23.400 --> 2:26:26.400]  and it shows how terrified the Chinese communists
[2:26:26.400 --> 2:26:27.400]  are of their own people.
[2:26:27.400 --> 2:26:31.400]  They are desperate, desperate to shift blame.
[2:26:31.400 --> 2:26:33.400]  I mean, in Missouri,
[2:26:33.400 --> 2:26:36.400]  the Chinese Consulate General from Chicago
[2:26:36.400 --> 2:26:40.400]  actually got in touch with a Republican senator
[2:26:40.400 --> 2:26:42.400]  and said, hey, State Senator,
[2:26:42.400 --> 2:26:44.400]  and said, hey, you're the President of the State Senate.
[2:26:44.400 --> 2:26:47.400]  Could you please put down a resolution congratulating China
[2:26:47.400 --> 2:26:51.400]  on how transparent it's been in telling everybody in time
[2:26:51.400 --> 2:26:53.400]  exactly all about this virus?
[2:26:53.400 --> 2:26:56.400]  And the President of the State's Senate, Mr. Roth,
[2:26:56.400 --> 2:26:58.400]  said, no, I won't, and he put down a resolution
[2:26:58.400 --> 2:27:00.400]  saying precisely the opposite.
[2:27:00.400 --> 2:27:04.400]  And so they're clearly being absolutely desperate now
[2:27:04.400 --> 2:27:06.400]  to try to cover this up.
[2:27:06.400 --> 2:27:09.400]  They know they can rely on the Democrats
[2:27:09.400 --> 2:27:13.400]  to say whatever the Chinese communists want them to say,
[2:27:13.400 --> 2:27:14.400]  because the Democrats are far too focused.
[2:27:14.400 --> 2:27:16.400]  I mean, I agree with you, but the cover-up's not working.
[2:27:16.400 --> 2:27:18.400]  So what comes next, then?
[2:27:18.400 --> 2:27:21.400]  So the, well, the propaganda isn't working.
[2:27:21.400 --> 2:27:23.400]  And so what comes next, I think,
[2:27:23.400 --> 2:27:27.400]  is eventually a trial of China
[2:27:27.400 --> 2:27:29.400]  at the International Criminal Court
[2:27:29.400 --> 2:27:32.400]  or at a new kind of Nuremberg court,
[2:27:32.400 --> 2:27:34.400]  which we would convene,
[2:27:34.400 --> 2:27:36.400]  the Western powers you were talking of earlier,
[2:27:36.400 --> 2:27:38.400]  we would convene our own court.
[2:27:38.400 --> 2:27:41.400]  We would invite China to attend
[2:27:41.400 --> 2:27:43.400]  and submit evidence in its defense.
[2:27:43.400 --> 2:27:45.400]  It would refuse.
[2:27:45.400 --> 2:27:48.400]  We would then try it in its absence,
[2:27:48.400 --> 2:27:50.400]  weighing the evidence carefully
[2:27:50.400 --> 2:27:53.400]  and having an advocate as Diavoli to speak for China.
[2:27:53.400 --> 2:27:56.400]  And then the judges would pronounce
[2:27:56.400 --> 2:27:59.400]  whether or not they thought that China
[2:27:59.400 --> 2:28:04.400]  had committed two particular crimes against humanity.
[2:28:04.400 --> 2:28:07.400]  The first is the crime of extermination,
[2:28:07.400 --> 2:28:10.400]  because by their failure to,
[2:28:10.400 --> 2:28:13.400]  not merely their failure to tell us about this,
[2:28:13.400 --> 2:28:15.400]  but the active suppression,
[2:28:15.400 --> 2:28:18.400]  both inside and outside China,
[2:28:18.400 --> 2:28:21.400]  of all news about this infection,
[2:28:21.400 --> 2:28:23.400]  which we can prove.
[2:28:23.400 --> 2:28:25.400]  And if you read my document, it's on the info.
[2:28:25.400 --> 2:28:27.400]  It is. Stay there then.
[2:28:27.400 --> 2:28:29.400]  I'm going to give you the floor next 10 minutes.
[2:28:29.400 --> 2:28:31.400]  You will have the floor to put on your case.
[2:28:31.400 --> 2:28:33.400]  It's a huge document.
[2:28:33.400 --> 2:28:35.400]  I read it over this morning, 26 pages. It's amazing.
[2:28:35.400 --> 2:28:38.400]  Most of it I knew, but a lot of it I didn't.
[2:28:38.400 --> 2:28:40.400]  You're going to have the time when we come back from break
[2:28:40.400 --> 2:28:43.400]  to lay out in China,
[2:28:43.400 --> 2:28:46.400]  common as China and the World Health Organization conspire
[2:28:46.400 --> 2:28:49.400]  to make crimes against humanity
[2:28:49.400 --> 2:28:52.400]  will cover it on the other side. Stay with us.
[2:28:52.400 --> 2:28:54.400]  Attention, gardeners.
[2:28:54.400 --> 2:28:56.400]  If you need to grow nutritionally dense vegetables
[2:28:56.400 --> 2:28:58.400]  or medicinal herbs this year, listen,
[2:28:58.400 --> 2:29:01.400]  because a bioactive superfood for plants is now available.
[2:29:01.400 --> 2:29:03.400]  This all-natural superfood for plants
[2:29:03.400 --> 2:29:05.400]  is so effective at producing maximum plant growth
[2:29:05.400 --> 2:29:08.400]  in minimum time that it almost forces plants to grow
[2:29:08.400 --> 2:29:10.400]  even under the worst light and soil conditions.
[2:29:10.400 --> 2:29:13.400]  It's called protogrow, and it's truly remarkable.
[2:29:13.400 --> 2:29:16.400]  Vegetables grow faster and contain more bioavailable vitamins
[2:29:16.400 --> 2:29:18.400]  and trace minerals. Plants that rarely bloom
[2:29:18.400 --> 2:29:20.400]  will flower constantly.
[2:29:20.400 --> 2:29:22.400]  Sickly plants become vibrantly alive.
[2:29:22.400 --> 2:29:24.400]  Medicinal herbs become superpotent.
[2:29:24.400 --> 2:29:27.400]  Flowers become more vivid right before your very eyes.
[2:29:27.400 --> 2:29:29.400]  Protogrow also improves the taste quality
[2:29:29.400 --> 2:29:31.400]  of all your garden vegetables.
[2:29:31.400 --> 2:29:33.400]  It's more than just an all-natural superfood for plants.
[2:29:33.400 --> 2:29:36.400]  It's a proprietary blend of bioactive sea nutrients
[2:29:36.400 --> 2:29:39.400]  that contain the basic building blocks of life itself,
[2:29:39.400 --> 2:29:41.400]  which is why protogrow even renews your garden
[2:29:41.400 --> 2:29:43.400]  by increasing the microorganisms in the soil.

[2:32:34.400 --> 2:32:36.400]  The food supply is running out.
[2:32:36.400 --> 2:32:38.400]  There are major shortages.
[2:32:38.400 --> 2:32:43.400]  This is a globalist siege, a globalist lockdown, globalist terrorism.
[2:32:43.400 --> 2:32:46.400]  But we the people, the patriots, have to be prepared.
[2:32:46.400 --> 2:32:48.400]  We've already been proven right about prepping so far.
[2:32:48.400 --> 2:32:50.400]  We'll get ready to be really proven right.

[2:32:56.400 --> 2:32:59.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:11.400 --> 2:33:15.400]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center
[2:33:15.400 --> 2:33:20.400]  in the heart of the resistance. It's Alex Jones.
[2:33:20.400 --> 2:33:24.400]  All right, and Lord Christopher Monton of what'supwiththat.com,
[2:33:24.400 --> 2:33:28.400]  the leading fighter against the global warming carbon tax.
[2:33:28.400 --> 2:33:32.400]  For me, the biggest issue is it's cutting off industry.
[2:33:32.400 --> 2:33:34.400]  It's cutting off life in the West.
[2:33:34.400 --> 2:33:36.400]  The left now saying, oh, it cut the carbon print.
[2:33:36.400 --> 2:33:39.400]  It's a great thing. CNN, Bill Gates, they're all saying it.
[2:33:39.400 --> 2:33:43.400]  Bill Gates is praising China's response and Trump did a bad job.
[2:33:43.400 --> 2:33:46.400]  You've just got all of this. What's a big picture for you?
[2:33:46.400 --> 2:33:48.400]  Because you could cover whatever you want.
[2:33:48.400 --> 2:33:51.400]  We've got the next 10 minutes of airtime without me interrupting.
[2:33:51.400 --> 2:33:54.400]  I'm going to just sit back and listen to you to talk about what we're facing.
[2:33:54.400 --> 2:33:58.400]  But it just feels so historical right now.
[2:33:58.400 --> 2:34:01.400]  Well, it is historical. Of that, there is no doubt.
[2:34:01.400 --> 2:34:03.400]  The word historical is appropriate.
[2:34:03.400 --> 2:34:08.400]  This is probably the most serious pandemic since the Great Plague.
[2:34:08.400 --> 2:34:12.400]  And that goes back to 1665. I remember it well.
[2:34:12.400 --> 2:34:17.400]  And now we have to realize that this plague that was loosed on us
[2:34:17.400 --> 2:34:21.400]  by the failure of China is indeed very serious.
[2:34:21.400 --> 2:34:26.400]  But let me deal very briefly before I get onto China's misbehavior
[2:34:26.400 --> 2:34:31.400]  with the point you raise about whether the vast reduction
[2:34:31.400 --> 2:34:36.400]  in carbon dioxide emissions that we are carrying out at the moment
[2:34:36.400 --> 2:34:39.400]  will make any difference to the global warming question.
[2:34:39.400 --> 2:34:43.400]  And the answer on the evidence so far, though it's admitted early days,
[2:34:43.400 --> 2:34:47.400]  is that it's not going to make very much difference at all.
[2:34:47.400 --> 2:34:50.400]  And if that proves to continue to be the case,
[2:34:50.400 --> 2:34:54.400]  and we'll know at the end of this month when we get the figures for April
[2:34:54.400 --> 2:34:59.400]  from Mauna Loa, because in April there really was a big global clampdown.
[2:34:59.400 --> 2:35:08.400]  And if that does not show through in the monthly average CO2 emissions chart,
[2:35:08.400 --> 2:35:11.400]  then that will tell us two things.
[2:35:11.400 --> 2:35:18.400]  It will tell us, first of all, that man is not responsible for the increases in CO2.
[2:35:18.400 --> 2:35:24.400]  And therefore, the second thing it tells us is that whatever we do to cut CO2
[2:35:24.400 --> 2:35:29.400]  is not going to make very much difference, if any, to global temperatures.
[2:35:29.400 --> 2:35:32.400]  Beautiful. And again, I wasn't articulate enough.
[2:35:32.400 --> 2:35:36.400]  I get it's all a fraud and we know that and you'll have more data to prove it now
[2:35:36.400 --> 2:35:40.400]  and we get that word mucked in. I mean, the death toll for people having carbon cut off.
[2:35:40.400 --> 2:35:42.400]  I care about people. Tell me about that.
[2:35:42.400 --> 2:35:45.400]  You're an expert on what cutting carbon off does to people.
[2:35:45.400 --> 2:35:51.400]  That's right. Well, of course, what cutting carbon does is exactly what you see around the world.
[2:35:51.400 --> 2:35:56.400]  You see an enormous loss of putting everything from agriculture to industry.
[2:35:56.400 --> 2:36:02.400]  As a result, people who depend on agriculture to get fed, it's as basic as that,
[2:36:02.400 --> 2:36:09.400]  are not going to get fed just as they wouldn't have got fed if the extreme greens had got their way
[2:36:09.400 --> 2:36:13.400]  and reduced the population of the planet by nine-tenths.
[2:36:13.400 --> 2:36:18.400]  You put an equation like a decade ago. I don't want to misquote you, but you were predicting
[2:36:18.400 --> 2:36:22.400]  if they got the cuts they wanted a billion debt over how many decades.
[2:36:22.400 --> 2:36:27.400]  Here it is. World Health Program head says, instead of 10 million dying, 30 million die this year.
[2:36:27.400 --> 2:36:32.400]  That's the global mail. Now AP reports 130 million break of starvation.
[2:36:32.400 --> 2:36:36.400]  Which number, sir, is correct? My God. Not even a million dead from COVID-19,
[2:36:36.400 --> 2:36:39.400]  but they're saying 130 million dead.
[2:36:39.400 --> 2:36:44.400]  The answer is nobody knows how many are going to get killed by the virus.
[2:36:44.400 --> 2:36:46.400]  Nobody knows how many are going to be starved.
[2:36:46.400 --> 2:36:50.400]  Trevor, this validates you saying cutting off the economy kills a lot of people.
[2:36:50.400 --> 2:36:54.400]  Now the UN says 130 million dead. God Almighty.
[2:36:54.400 --> 2:37:01.400]  If you shut down the economy, you have to be careful that you don't do more damage
[2:37:01.400 --> 2:37:06.400]  and cause more disease and death, both mental as well as physical disease, of course, and death
[2:37:06.400 --> 2:37:09.400]  by doing that, then you would by letting the virus run.
[2:37:09.400 --> 2:37:13.400]  My point is, sir, this vindicates your harping for decades.
[2:37:13.400 --> 2:37:17.400]  You've been on the show for like 15 years that if you cut carbon, it causes mass death.
[2:37:17.400 --> 2:37:22.400]  Here's the UN saying 30 to 130 million dead the next two years if this continues.
[2:37:22.400 --> 2:37:24.400]  This vindication you said.
[2:37:24.400 --> 2:37:32.400]  Absolutely. They are now being made by this crisis to face how extremely
[2:37:32.400 --> 2:37:38.400]  misconceived their policy of trying to cut global warming by attacking CO2 actually was.
[2:37:38.400 --> 2:37:41.400]  And consider Governor Cuomo in New York, for instance.
[2:37:41.400 --> 2:37:44.400]  Now, New York has a very high population density.
[2:37:44.400 --> 2:37:47.400]  You have all those projects with vast, great tower blocks.
[2:37:47.400 --> 2:37:50.400]  People piled one on top of the other, all having to use the same lift.
[2:37:50.400 --> 2:37:52.400]  Let's get down to the people here.
[2:37:52.400 --> 2:37:59.400]  What happens is if you get a pandemic getting into New York, it's going to kill as it has killed a lot of people.
[2:37:59.400 --> 2:38:07.400]  And yet what the UN's Agenda 2030 policy says is that people who live in the countryside like me
[2:38:07.400 --> 2:38:11.400]  must be told not to do that for the sake of the rabbits and the bunnies.
[2:38:11.400 --> 2:38:17.400]  We must go and live in these huge tower blocks in the cities so that they can kill us all off with infections, I suppose.
[2:38:17.400 --> 2:38:22.400]  So that is now going to have to be rethought as is the whole global warming storyline.
[2:38:22.400 --> 2:38:30.400]  The reason I raise this business about the CO2 measurements not showing the decline that the left had expected
[2:38:30.400 --> 2:38:38.400]  is very important because that will show even to the left that their policy of trying to regulate CO2
[2:38:38.400 --> 2:38:43.400]  was purposeless and calculated to do not only damage but cause widespread death.
[2:38:43.400 --> 2:38:47.400]  And that's why I bring this up Lord Monty because you were the guy pioneering the carbon cuts caused death
[2:38:47.400 --> 2:38:49.400]  and now they're admitting you're right.
[2:38:49.400 --> 2:38:50.400]  I mean, this is huge.
[2:38:50.400 --> 2:38:56.400]  You don't care about vindication, but vindication brings realization and action.
[2:38:56.400 --> 2:38:58.400]  Well, eventually I think this is right.
[2:38:58.400 --> 2:39:04.400]  Already they've had to cancel the futile UN GAB Fest, which they have ever in December.
[2:39:04.400 --> 2:39:10.400]  It was going to be in Glasgow this year, which would have been very good for the delegates because Glasgow is a bit of a dump.
[2:39:10.400 --> 2:39:13.400]  But anyway, that's been cancelled.
[2:39:13.400 --> 2:39:18.400]  And that's going to remind them that they could actually perfectly well do these conferences online these days.
[2:39:18.400 --> 2:39:23.400]  You do not need physically to go somewhere in your private jet as Al Gore used to do.
[2:39:23.400 --> 2:39:25.400]  Instead, you can do it all online.
[2:39:25.400 --> 2:39:30.400]  But the important message here is, and this is why it ties into global warming,
[2:39:30.400 --> 2:39:35.400]  which is why I mentioned this business of the CO2 having huge emissions cuts,
[2:39:35.400 --> 2:39:38.400]  but this is not showing through in the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere.
[2:39:38.400 --> 2:39:40.400]  That's a very, very important point.
[2:39:40.400 --> 2:39:44.400]  That's one to watch in the coming months, because if that carries on,
[2:39:44.400 --> 2:39:48.400]  then it will tell me that where the CO2 is coming from is the oceans,
[2:39:48.400 --> 2:39:51.400]  where there's 70 times as much of it as there is in the air.
[2:39:51.400 --> 2:39:56.400]  But if I may, I'm going to switch from that back to the main topic here,
[2:39:56.400 --> 2:40:04.400]  which is what are we going to do to prevent China from releasing yet another pandemic?
[2:40:04.400 --> 2:40:08.400]  Oh, I'm glad you make that point, because even the New York Times admits
[2:40:08.400 --> 2:40:12.400]  all major pandemics of the last 40 years come out of China.
[2:40:12.400 --> 2:40:16.400]  Why is that? What is going on there, Lord Monkton?
[2:40:16.400 --> 2:40:18.400]  Well, there are two reasons why this is.
[2:40:18.400 --> 2:40:23.400]  The first is that it's a communist country,
[2:40:23.400 --> 2:40:29.400]  and therefore the people are treated like dirt and live in filthy conditions.
[2:40:29.400 --> 2:40:36.400]  And they have to take the wet market, which is where the Chinese say that the virus originated.
[2:40:36.400 --> 2:40:38.400]  I suspect that...
[2:40:38.400 --> 2:40:42.400]  No, it's a filthy spectacle of garbage, but exactly, but still it's still there.
[2:40:42.400 --> 2:40:44.400]  It's still there. It's still open.
[2:40:44.400 --> 2:40:50.400]  It's still allowing live animals of different species to rub against each other in very crowded cages
[2:40:50.400 --> 2:40:53.400]  so that they can transmit diseases between themselves.
[2:40:53.400 --> 2:40:56.400]  So if you get a pangolin, a protected species, that only the Chinese...
[2:40:56.400 --> 2:41:01.400]  I don't think it's the Chinese, but no one in their right mind would eat anything that came out of something like this.
[2:41:01.400 --> 2:41:07.400]  No, but they do, because the government keeps them in such abject poverty and misery
[2:41:07.400 --> 2:41:10.400]  that that's all that they're used to.
[2:41:10.400 --> 2:41:12.400]  So they put up with it.
[2:41:12.400 --> 2:41:15.400]  They wouldn't if they knew how much cleaner and better things are in the West,
[2:41:15.400 --> 2:41:20.400]  and of course the Chinese are doing their best to make sure that only those trusted by the party
[2:41:20.400 --> 2:41:24.400]  are allowed to come to our universities and spread communism there.
[2:41:24.400 --> 2:41:29.400]  So the Chinese have been the source of, just looking at the last few,
[2:41:29.400 --> 2:41:37.400]  that there was SARS number one in 2003, where they were criticized for not telling the World Health Organization
[2:41:37.400 --> 2:41:39.400]  or the rest of the world in time.
[2:41:39.400 --> 2:41:43.400]  Fortunately, that one fizzled out without having gone very far.
[2:41:43.400 --> 2:41:48.400]  Then there was swine flu, which until COVID came along was the biggest killer.
[2:41:48.400 --> 2:41:52.400]  COVID has now overtaken swine flu as the biggest killer,
[2:41:52.400 --> 2:41:57.400]  and swine flu took 18 months to kill somewhere between 100 and 5,000 people,
[2:41:57.400 --> 2:42:01.400]  and this has taken three or four weeks, so it's much more dangerous.
[2:42:01.400 --> 2:42:09.400]  And the problem is that we cannot any longer afford to have communism,
[2:42:09.400 --> 2:42:13.400]  whether in China or in the West or anywhere in the world,
[2:42:13.400 --> 2:42:16.400]  communism in any form of totalitarianism like that,
[2:42:16.400 --> 2:42:23.400]  where you have a powerful elite which is always more concerned to protect its own reputation and its power
[2:42:23.400 --> 2:42:26.400]  than it is to look after the people or care about...
[2:42:26.400 --> 2:42:33.400]  All right, Christopher Monkton, stay there, then come back and tell us the battle plan for 1776 worldwide.
[2:42:33.400 --> 2:42:36.400]  How do we defeat this? How does Trump win? What do we do?
[2:42:36.400 --> 2:42:41.400]  Again, you're part of UKIP, part of all the great work that Nasr Faraj has done, a great thought leader.
[2:42:41.400 --> 2:42:47.400]  Lord Christopher Monkton, what's up with that.com. We're right back with Lord Monkton. Really great to have him on with us.
[2:43:12.400 --> 2:43:17.400]  And the very people that cooked it up and gave it to the chai comms at the World Health Organization,
[2:43:17.400 --> 2:43:22.400]  with Bill Gates involved are now the ones running the operation to shut down society,
[2:43:22.400 --> 2:43:25.400]  create a depression, and forcibly inoculate everybody. This is insane.
[2:43:25.400 --> 2:43:28.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, if they succeed, it's over.
[2:43:28.400 --> 2:43:34.400]  You need to get prepared now. You need to get high-quality, swarble food now back in stock at infowarstore.com,
[2:43:34.400 --> 2:43:38.400]  and you need to get politically active and challenge this verbally everywhere.
[2:43:38.400 --> 2:43:44.400]  Big Tech is trying to censor everyone right now and bully people into saying you can't even challenge verbally social distancing.
[2:43:44.400 --> 2:43:50.400]  This is beyond 1984. The tyranny of the dual orders here. Get prepared now and spread the word in the info war.
[2:43:50.400 --> 2:43:52.400]  You are the Paul Revere's.
[2:43:52.400 --> 2:43:57.400]  I'm always excited about info wars life products. They're amazing. They're cutting edge. You love them. I love them.
[2:43:57.400 --> 2:44:00.400]  And they find the info war in the face of the globalist onslaught.
[2:44:00.400 --> 2:44:07.400]  But we have come up with a new product over a year in development that is amazing.
[2:44:07.400 --> 2:44:14.400]  The only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top of it.
[2:44:14.400 --> 2:44:19.400]  And there's another innovation. It's the spray cap.
[2:44:19.400 --> 2:44:27.400]  It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick, gross goo, but it's high quality. It aerosolizes it in a really great way.
[2:44:27.400 --> 2:44:30.400]  I like to put it on my hands, rub a little bit on my face.
[2:44:30.400 --> 2:44:33.400]  It's got organic alcohol in it, so spray it right in your eyes.
[2:44:33.400 --> 2:44:37.400]  But I just love it. Personally, it has something that's a moisturizer as well.
[2:44:37.400 --> 2:44:42.400]  So, this is a real innovation. I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer
[2:44:42.400 --> 2:44:47.400]  that actually has essential oil in it so it doesn't dry you out. It smells great.
[2:44:47.400 --> 2:44:50.400]  It's so refreshing. This is a big winner.
[2:44:54.400 --> 2:45:01.400]  Well, Communist China wouldn't sign on to the carbon taxes that would cut their energy used by half.
[2:45:01.400 --> 2:45:06.400]  The United States wouldn't sign on to it. So guess what happened? Along came COVID-19
[2:45:06.400 --> 2:45:11.400]  and Bill Gates is celebrating saying it's already cut your carbon footprint by half.
[2:45:11.400 --> 2:45:15.400]  And that means you're going to be poor now and under his control.
[2:45:15.400 --> 2:45:18.400]  And of course, with the medical care and it comes the force inoculations,
[2:45:18.400 --> 2:45:22.400]  a eke microchip that comes with the vaccine and so much more.
[2:45:22.400 --> 2:45:27.400]  And Bill Gates admits that 700,000 people will get sick and die from it.
[2:45:27.400 --> 2:45:32.400]  So remember, folks, they're coming to hurt you and your family and destroy your basic rights.
[2:45:32.400 --> 2:45:36.400]  The same left that says to kill babies all day long, women own their bodies.
[2:45:36.400 --> 2:45:40.400]  Now say you don't own your body and they're coming to forcibly inoculate you.
[2:45:40.400 --> 2:45:44.400]  And if you don't submit, you can't buy or sell or leave your home, mark the beast.
[2:45:44.400 --> 2:45:48.400]  Oh, and guess what? Jeffrey Epstein and all these people hang out together with Bill Gates
[2:45:48.400 --> 2:45:53.400]  and are a bunch of dirty devil worshipers in your face. They hate you and your family.
[2:45:53.400 --> 2:46:01.400]  Globalism is all about making the nation state and the population itself obsolete, non-essential.
[2:46:01.400 --> 2:46:06.400]  That's why they position it with economic tariffs, taxes and controls
[2:46:06.400 --> 2:46:10.400]  to where family farms and industry that's based in the United States
[2:46:10.400 --> 2:46:14.400]  has to shut down or be part of a large corporate conglomerate.
[2:46:14.400 --> 2:46:20.400]  That's part of making us obsolete so that as the human world is phased out,
[2:46:20.400 --> 2:46:25.400]  they can simply look at us and say, because again, you are non-essential.
[2:46:25.400 --> 2:46:28.400]  That's what the robots and all of this is about.
[2:46:28.400 --> 2:46:32.400]  It's about setting it up where we're no longer in charge of our lives.
[2:46:32.400 --> 2:46:36.400]  We can be told to stay on our houses and after all, shut up.
[2:46:36.400 --> 2:46:40.400]  This world doesn't belong to people anyways. It belongs to the new AI gods,
[2:46:40.400 --> 2:46:44.400]  the rich and leaders that emerge with machines. Yeah, that sounds completely insane, doesn't it?
[2:46:44.400 --> 2:46:48.400]  That's actually the public plan they're pushing.
[2:46:48.400 --> 2:46:55.400]  These people are completely psychotic and make Hitler look like a choir boy.
[2:47:18.400 --> 2:47:22.400]  You know, I don't want to be an enemy of the FBI. I want to believe our government's good.
[2:47:22.400 --> 2:47:28.400]  But now it's come out in federal documents that the FBI lied on 302s about General Flynn
[2:47:28.400 --> 2:47:32.400]  and said that he said things he never said.
[2:47:32.400 --> 2:47:35.400]  They were ordered by Obama and Hillary to go lie.
[2:47:35.400 --> 2:47:39.400]  That just scares me that they have got people that ready to make crimes.
[2:47:39.400 --> 2:47:42.400]  But they're being mopped up. They're being defeated right now,
[2:47:42.400 --> 2:47:46.400]  but they're using this virus to shut down the economy.
[2:47:46.400 --> 2:47:49.400]  Christopher Monkton is here with us.
[2:47:49.400 --> 2:47:53.400]  And he's been a top advisor to Margaret Thatcher. He's a great author, researcher.
[2:47:53.400 --> 2:47:55.400]  What's up with that dot com?
[2:47:55.400 --> 2:47:59.400]  What about solutions? How do we go on the offense? Who are the players?
[2:47:59.400 --> 2:48:02.400]  They're the big grand design Lord Monkton. What do you see about to happen?
[2:48:02.400 --> 2:48:05.400]  And what can we as little people do?
[2:48:05.400 --> 2:48:10.400]  Right. First, we'll start with the relationship between China and the WHO.
[2:48:10.400 --> 2:48:18.400]  The last two leaders of the WHO, Margaret Chan, who was from Hong Kong, a communist,
[2:48:18.400 --> 2:48:25.400]  and now Gebreus from Ethiopia, a communist, a member of the China-funded TIGRA Liberation Front,
[2:48:25.400 --> 2:48:29.400]  which was one of four such Marxist parties that constituted the government.
[2:48:29.400 --> 2:48:37.400]  He has a history of failing to admit that an outbreak of infection is an outbreak of infection.
[2:48:37.400 --> 2:48:44.400]  There were three separate outbreaks of cholera because the government in Ethiopia was communist and not competent.
[2:48:44.400 --> 2:48:50.400]  There you see Gebreus with Xi Jinping, the present Chinese dictator.
[2:48:50.400 --> 2:48:57.400]  And Gebreus on three occasions said that these cholera outbreaks were just watery diarrhea.
[2:48:57.400 --> 2:49:03.400]  And so when China came along and tried to deny that there was a serious outbreak in Wuhan,
[2:49:03.400 --> 2:49:10.400]  Gebreus went along with China and every time China uttered a lie within the day,
[2:49:10.400 --> 2:49:17.400]  Gebreus would make a statement parroting exactly the same lie and often very much in the same words.
[2:49:17.400 --> 2:49:25.400]  So Gebreus is a serious problem and he is going to have to go as is his former deputy,
[2:49:25.400 --> 2:49:35.400]  Ailwood, another communist, who when interviewed by a Hong Kong radio station recently about whether Taiwan,
[2:49:35.400 --> 2:49:42.400]  which is the nationalist, non-communist island off China, had been doing a good job in controlling the pandemic,
[2:49:42.400 --> 2:49:47.400]  which it has. It's just about the best in the world along with South Korea.
[2:49:47.400 --> 2:49:51.400]  Ailwood wouldn't even refer to Taiwan as a separate country.
[2:49:51.400 --> 2:49:59.400]  He referred to it as a province of China and the World Health Organization then used data given to it by P. King
[2:49:59.400 --> 2:50:06.400]  about the spread of the pandemic in Taiwan, data which was inaccurate rather than using data from Taiwan,
[2:50:06.400 --> 2:50:11.400]  which the WHO excludes from membership of the WHO.
[2:50:11.400 --> 2:50:14.400]  So all of that is going to have to be put right.
[2:50:14.400 --> 2:50:23.400]  We're going to have to exclude China from the WHO unless and until on pain of massive damages.
[2:50:23.400 --> 2:50:29.400]  It agrees that in future it will comply with the international health regulations.
[2:50:29.400 --> 2:50:36.400]  We're going to have to admit Taiwan to the World Health Organization, whether China likes it or not.
[2:50:36.400 --> 2:50:45.400]  But Jabraeus, his former deputy, Ailwood, must go. And so must Ryan, who is the head of emergency programs at the WHO,
[2:50:45.400 --> 2:50:52.400]  another communist who gave the most cringing, headbanging speech about China in front of the Chinese
[2:50:52.400 --> 2:50:58.400]  Foreign Minister at the Munich Security Conference on February the 15th just before the world was shut down.
[2:50:58.400 --> 2:51:06.400]  These people have all got to go. And until they do, I think we must all defund the WHO.
[2:51:06.400 --> 2:51:10.400]  Now Britain hasn't defunded it. We're always too goody-two-shoes about these things.
[2:51:10.400 --> 2:51:14.400]  We pay a fortune to these supranational organizations and we shouldn't.
[2:51:14.400 --> 2:51:18.400]  So that's the first step. Otherwise this is going to happen again.
[2:51:18.400 --> 2:51:24.400]  The next thing I think that most people getting back to your emphasis on people, Alex, are going to be interested in
[2:51:24.400 --> 2:51:34.400]  is how do we get out of these lockdowns safely and without killing any more people than this wretched virus already has?
[2:51:34.400 --> 2:51:43.400]  And here I think the answer is as follows. First of all, there are a number of businesses which take place out of doors.
[2:51:43.400 --> 2:51:48.400]  Training for football clubs, farming, two obvious examples.
[2:51:48.400 --> 2:51:57.400]  Those businesses can restart pretty much straight away because the evidence such as it is, and there's still not really enough of it to make definitive decisions,
[2:51:57.400 --> 2:52:05.400]  is that the virus doesn't spread very effectively out of doors. Like many of these viruses, it's an indoor problem.
[2:52:05.400 --> 2:52:09.400]  So what do we do about indoors? Well, there are two things.
[2:52:09.400 --> 2:52:22.400]  First of all, if you are not taking a daily dose of vitamin G, 1,000 international units or 25 micrograms of a gel tablet of vitamin D3,
[2:52:22.400 --> 2:52:34.400]  that's the one you need. You need to take that because so far the only credible research on what actually does work to slow down the chance,
[2:52:34.400 --> 2:52:40.400]  lessen the chance of your catching the virus and slow down its effects if you do, is vitamin D.
[2:52:40.400 --> 2:52:43.400]  It's the one thing that has been comprehensively...
[2:52:43.400 --> 2:52:51.400]  And by the way, I was going to interrupt, Moncton. They're literally SWAT teaming medical facilities giving vitamin C and D3 to people
[2:52:51.400 --> 2:52:57.400]  and saying, no, there's no treatment for COVID even though the doctors are authorized to give that period because it's not even a prescription.
[2:52:57.400 --> 2:53:05.400]  Who got in control of Big Pharma to say, no hope, no vitamin C, no D3, no zinc? And the presidents have an attack for mentioning that.
[2:53:05.400 --> 2:53:15.400]  A paper in one of the leading medical journals just two years ago went into the effectiveness of vitamin D3.
[2:53:15.400 --> 2:53:21.400]  No, obviously you die without it. It's what I'm saying is it's essential. It's on the damn label.
[2:53:21.400 --> 2:53:30.400]  So since when did Big Pharma, even since the US president mentioning zinc, he brings out zinc that I feel like was wearing a Nazi flag or something.
[2:53:30.400 --> 2:53:33.400]  I mean, they just freak out. What's causing that?
[2:53:33.400 --> 2:53:40.400]  Well, certainly I don't know. Of course, the president is in a very hard place. He would love to find a cure.
[2:53:40.400 --> 2:53:47.400]  And he first of all talked about hydroxychloroquine in association with azithromycin.
[2:53:47.400 --> 2:53:55.400]  My sin, he not only talked about it at a press conference and was promptly and rightly in my view contradicted by Dr. Forsey, but also he tweeted about it.
[2:53:55.400 --> 2:54:03.400]  And that led to people rushing out to buy it. And that unfortunately can have, doesn't always, but it can have very strong side effects.
[2:54:03.400 --> 2:54:06.400]  Sure, if you don't have zinc already, it can cause a problem.
[2:54:06.400 --> 2:54:12.400]  That's right. But don't get this particular medication unless your doctor has said that it's right for you.
[2:54:12.400 --> 2:54:17.400]  Whereas vitamin D, you can safely take a dose of that and buy it over the count. It's cheaper chips.
[2:54:17.400 --> 2:54:25.400]  No, I agree. I mean, I think hydroxychloroquine and zinc are a distraction from vitamin D, vitamin C, zinc.
[2:54:25.400 --> 2:54:30.400]  I think that's, I'm less sure about zinc. I haven't seen enough evidence on that.
[2:54:30.400 --> 2:54:38.400]  Vitamin C certainly is generally effective against viruses. Vitamin D against this particular virus, still more so.
[2:54:38.400 --> 2:54:45.400]  No, I've had medical doctors on and just keep erupting going. Forget zinc, Jones, vitamin D, vitamin D3. So why is that?
[2:54:45.400 --> 2:54:46.400]  Concentrate on vitamin D3.
[2:54:46.400 --> 2:54:51.400]  You were the science advisor to Margaret Thatcher. I mean, you're a scientist. You should be able to speak to this.
[2:54:51.400 --> 2:54:54.400]  They say no one can. Why is vitamin D3 so important?
[2:54:54.400 --> 2:55:04.400]  The reason why vitamin D is that this virus doesn't like sunlight in any form and it doesn't like the sunlight which gets on your skin, turns into vitamin D3.
[2:55:04.400 --> 2:55:07.400]  So like, so D3 is literally like captured sunlight.
[2:55:07.400 --> 2:55:13.400]  It's like captured sunlight and it's cheap and it is proven. This is the other thing.
[2:55:13.400 --> 2:55:19.400]  You see, I am actually working on a medication at the moment against this virus.
[2:55:19.400 --> 2:55:23.400]  I think the chance that it will work is pretty remote.
[2:55:23.400 --> 2:55:31.400]  But there is a chance because somebody appears to have inserted at four points in the outer proteins of this pathogen.
[2:55:31.400 --> 2:55:34.400]  They've inserted chunks of the HIV virus.
[2:55:34.400 --> 2:55:37.400]  See, you didn't want to go there. Hold on. Do five more minutes.
[2:55:37.400 --> 2:55:41.400]  Well, as we got up on the break, you have the discoverer of HIV.
[2:55:41.400 --> 2:55:48.400]  Nobel Prize winner is saying it's man-made Indian scientist saying at major universities and exactly.
[2:55:48.400 --> 2:55:52.400]  So we're going to come back from break. We'll do five more minutes of Lord Moncton because he's a really smart cookie.
[2:55:52.400 --> 2:55:54.400]  He's starting to say it.
[2:55:54.400 --> 2:55:57.400]  What does it mean that HIV delivery says has been put in here?
[2:55:57.400 --> 2:55:59.400]  Now, let me say this.
[2:55:59.400 --> 2:56:05.400]  When I promote our multivitamins or I promote our vitamin D3, I've been selling these for five years, some of them 10 years.
[2:56:05.400 --> 2:56:07.400]  We've had them, our own company, 10 years.
[2:56:07.400 --> 2:56:11.400]  So I promote this because it's essential and it makes everybody's lives better.
[2:56:11.400 --> 2:56:13.400]  We've got high quality versions.
[2:56:13.400 --> 2:56:16.400]  I'm not saying it's a treatment or I'm not saying it's a cure for COVID-19.
[2:56:16.400 --> 2:56:18.400]  The media is saying that. They're damn liars.
[2:56:18.400 --> 2:56:24.400]  What I'm saying is X2, deep earth crystal, 8 to 12,000 feet, pure iodine.
[2:56:24.400 --> 2:56:26.400]  Nobody else that I know has this.
[2:56:26.400 --> 2:56:33.400]  We have to get a DEA license to have this at a factory locked up in a safe because they can do a lot of stuff with the wrong.
[2:56:33.400 --> 2:56:35.400]  But once it's put in the palm oil, it's safe.
[2:56:35.400 --> 2:56:41.400]  We also have the other vitamin mineral fusion that's got zinc and so many things with it.
[2:56:41.400 --> 2:56:44.400]  And we also have real red pill, real red pill plus.
[2:56:44.400 --> 2:56:45.400]  That's how we fund our operation.
[2:56:45.400 --> 2:56:50.400]  But I went out and said, what is the ultimate multivitamin mineral system?
[2:56:50.400 --> 2:56:51.400]  And they said, this is it.
[2:56:51.400 --> 2:56:53.400]  So we put it out years ago.
[2:56:53.400 --> 2:56:56.400]  They're attacking me going, Jones claims you need all this stuff.
[2:56:56.400 --> 2:56:57.400]  No, that's all iPhones.
[2:56:57.400 --> 2:57:03.400]  We're promoting products we know that are essential to human activity, like oxygen, like water, like vitamin C.
[2:57:03.400 --> 2:57:05.400]  But that's how we fund ourselves.
[2:57:05.400 --> 2:57:07.400]  And yeah, we're selling snake food.
[2:57:07.400 --> 2:57:09.400]  We have the biggest, best storeable food company in the world.
[2:57:09.400 --> 2:57:13.400]  But they claim selling storeable food to be prepared and have a backup is bad.
[2:57:13.400 --> 2:57:17.400]  So I'm calling it snake food now available at infowarstore.com.
[2:57:17.400 --> 2:57:21.400]  At the lowest high quality price you're going to find from any reputable company.
[2:57:21.400 --> 2:57:25.400]  They say food is now a conspiracy theory.
[2:57:25.400 --> 2:57:26.400]  You don't need food.
[2:57:26.400 --> 2:57:27.400]  You don't need water.
[2:57:27.400 --> 2:57:28.400]  You don't need sunlight.
[2:57:28.400 --> 2:57:29.400]  Well, it's all damn lie.
[2:57:29.400 --> 2:57:30.400]  infowarstore.com.
[2:57:30.400 --> 2:57:38.400]  But since Lord Moncton brought it up, the whole bio weapon angle of this and the insertions in the virus,
[2:57:38.400 --> 2:57:40.400]  we'll talk about it in two minutes.
[2:57:40.400 --> 2:57:52.400]  Look, the globalists are Satanists, all right?
[2:57:52.400 --> 2:57:55.400]  Lord Rothschild recently posed at a gallery of art worshipping the devil and praising Lucifer.
[2:57:55.400 --> 2:57:56.400]  You cannot make this up.
[2:57:56.400 --> 2:57:58.400]  They flaunt it in our face.
[2:57:58.400 --> 2:57:59.400]  That's what environmentalism is.
[2:57:59.400 --> 2:58:05.400]  It's about having an anti-human future and having people live in a subsistence, feudal, serf state.
[2:58:05.400 --> 2:58:06.400]  That's what they want.
[2:58:06.400 --> 2:58:11.400]  People who have stolen the planet or worth trillions of dollars do not want you having a good life.
[2:58:11.400 --> 2:58:12.400]  They know you're having fun.
[2:58:12.400 --> 2:58:15.400]  They know you have a great wife, a great husband, great children.
[2:58:15.400 --> 2:58:17.400]  They hate your guts.
[2:58:17.400 --> 2:58:20.400]  They are the most horrible, evil people on the planet.
[2:58:20.400 --> 2:58:25.400]  They openly fund racism, war, degeneracy, pedophilia, everything else.
[2:58:25.400 --> 2:58:30.400]  Imagine the most horrible thing in the universe and then imagine it doubled, tripled, quadrupled.
[2:58:30.400 --> 2:58:35.400]  And being gullible and being domesticated just makes them rise up and attack you harder.
[2:58:35.400 --> 2:58:38.400]  And they're the ones that launched this whole attack on the planet.
[2:58:38.400 --> 2:59:07.400]  And they are the enemy of humanity and need to be stood up against.
[2:59:08.400 --> 2:59:09.400]  It's amazing.
[2:59:09.400 --> 2:59:10.400]  It tastes sweet naturally.
[2:59:10.400 --> 2:59:15.400]  Let it sit there about 30 seconds to a minute and then you swallow the rest.
[2:59:15.400 --> 2:59:16.400]  And it's just amazing.
[2:59:16.400 --> 2:59:18.400]  It's back in stock.
[2:59:18.400 --> 2:59:23.400]  And yes, we're going to offer it at 50% off because that's the right thing to do during this crisis.

[3:00:10.400 --> 3:00:35.400]  Well, Lord Mock is one of the smartest people I know.
[3:00:35.400 --> 3:00:36.400]  What's up with that.com.
[3:00:36.400 --> 3:00:39.400]  And it's limited time we have left with him.
[3:00:39.400 --> 3:00:41.400]  Getting into the virus is provenance.
[3:00:41.400 --> 3:00:43.400]  It's it's lineage.
[3:00:43.400 --> 3:00:45.400]  It's it's family line.
[3:00:45.400 --> 3:00:48.400]  And here's, you know, mainstream news.
[3:00:48.400 --> 3:00:52.400]  Nobel bio researcher COVID-19 was lab accident.
[3:00:52.400 --> 3:00:54.400]  Says it was man made leaked.
[3:00:54.400 --> 3:00:59.400]  Well, we already have major institutes saying that reports up on M4store.com.
[3:00:59.400 --> 3:01:01.400]  Count of China's crowns against humanity.
[3:01:01.400 --> 3:01:08.400]  In closing, you were starting to get into the gene insertions, the HIV delivery system involved with this virus.
[3:01:08.400 --> 3:01:17.400]  Yes, the GP 41 protein that comes from the HIV virus appears to have been inserted or somehow have arrived.
[3:01:17.400 --> 3:01:25.400]  Let's put it no stronger than that at four points in the very short genome of COVID-19.
[3:01:25.400 --> 3:01:30.400]  It only has 30,000 base pairs, which is tiny for a living organism.
[3:01:30.400 --> 3:01:40.400]  So the researchers at the Wuhan P4 laboratory, which is supposed to be a high security laboratory under the control of the military,
[3:01:40.400 --> 3:01:49.400]  were doing research, I think, that was intended to make the coronavirus more easily infect humans,
[3:01:49.400 --> 3:01:57.400]  not so that they could use as a bio weapon, but so that they could find a vaccine against it in case another of these coronaviruses got out.
[3:01:57.400 --> 3:02:01.400]  And I think that the purpose was a perfectly respectable one.
[3:02:01.400 --> 3:02:05.400]  Exactly. People keep saying it was bio made. Why it's not super deadly?
[3:02:05.400 --> 3:02:09.400]  Well, it is deadly. They were trying to create a vaccine for it.
[3:02:09.400 --> 3:02:11.400]  That's right. I think that's what was going on.
[3:02:11.400 --> 3:02:16.400]  And it got out because the containment procedures at the laboratory were sloppy.
[3:02:16.400 --> 3:02:18.400]  And this has been known for some years.
[3:02:18.400 --> 3:02:21.400]  Even the Obama administration that used to fund that.
[3:02:21.400 --> 3:02:23.400]  Frozen 2015.
[3:02:23.400 --> 3:02:26.400]  Yeah, when it realized how dangerous it was.
[3:02:26.400 --> 3:02:38.400]  And a containment detonator failed to go off when a vial full of contaminated blood and urine spilled on a graduate researcher there.
[3:02:38.400 --> 3:02:49.400]  She has now had her name is still on the website of the laboratory, but her photograph and her thesis and her bio have disappeared.
[3:02:49.400 --> 3:02:58.400]  I come culture to cover up that communism capitalism rewards you for exposing flaws. Communism punishes you.
[3:02:58.400 --> 3:03:00.400]  And exactly. And so they won't say where she is.
[3:03:00.400 --> 3:03:02.400]  So she has been disappeared.
[3:03:02.400 --> 3:03:07.400]  And that is the second of the two crimes against humanity of which China is guilty.
[3:03:07.400 --> 3:03:12.400]  The first one, of course, causing extermination by not reporting the virus properly.
[3:03:12.400 --> 3:03:14.400]  That is in conspiracy with the WHO.
[3:03:14.400 --> 3:03:19.400]  I think they're guilty of that. And the second crime of disappearing people who tried to blow the whistle.
[3:03:19.400 --> 3:03:22.400]  Seven doctors have gone missing as well as this researcher.
[3:03:22.400 --> 3:03:25.400]  That's a very serious crime against humanity as well.
[3:03:25.400 --> 3:03:30.400]  And the world can no longer tolerate communism.
[3:03:30.400 --> 3:03:34.400]  However much it has infected our universities, we've got to get.
[3:03:34.400 --> 3:03:38.400]  Why does communism produce the bio leaks and the nuclear reactor leaks?
[3:03:38.400 --> 3:03:40.400]  Why does it do this?
[3:03:40.400 --> 3:03:46.400]  Because they're desperate to try to make themselves look like a real Western economy.
[3:03:46.400 --> 3:03:50.400]  Trying to run a command economy profitably is extremely difficult.
[3:03:50.400 --> 3:03:54.400]  Because my employees involved in incentives, they all do great.
[3:03:54.400 --> 3:03:59.400]  If I tried to command them without it would not work like the incentives incentives.
[3:03:59.400 --> 3:04:07.400]  And so they're always trying to gain an advantage by developing new and fancy drugs, et cetera, et cetera.
[3:04:07.400 --> 3:04:10.400]  And they're not very good at it. They're not very good at what they do.
[3:04:10.400 --> 3:04:16.400]  That's why all these personal protective masks and gowns from China have been in the wrong boxes.
[3:04:16.400 --> 3:04:18.400]  They don't work. They're not up to standard.
[3:04:18.400 --> 3:04:22.400]  And, you know, every country that's had them from Turkey to Spain twice.
[3:04:22.400 --> 3:04:26.400]  Because the manager is demanding bulk instead of quality.
[3:04:26.400 --> 3:04:28.400]  So I didn't hear that.
[3:04:28.400 --> 3:04:31.400]  Because the bosses are demanding bulk, not quality.
[3:04:31.400 --> 3:04:37.400]  Well, they're desperate for bulk, of course, but they had hoped they would get quality.
[3:04:37.400 --> 3:04:40.400]  But, of course, from China you don't. That's the trouble.
[3:04:40.400 --> 3:04:42.400]  It's a third world country pretending to...
[3:04:42.400 --> 3:04:46.400]  Back in 60 Seconds, Lord Monkton, do a final statement for us.
[3:04:46.400 --> 3:05:02.400]  Welcome back. The Gerald Solente takes over. I'm Alex Jones.
[3:05:16.400 --> 3:05:20.400]  And to get your universal income, you're going to have to take the inoculations,
[3:05:20.400 --> 3:05:23.400]  brainwash your kids the way they say, and have absolutely no freedom.
[3:05:23.400 --> 3:05:25.400]  And it's all happening, boom, overnight.
[3:05:25.400 --> 3:05:27.400]  This is a giant revolution.
[3:05:27.400 --> 3:05:29.400]  And as soon as you put the handcuffs on, they said,
[3:05:29.400 --> 3:05:31.400]  oh, it's just an extended spring break, two weeks.
[3:05:31.400 --> 3:05:34.400]  Notice now it's 18 months, two years, five years.
[3:05:34.400 --> 3:05:39.400]  It never ends. No one can ever die from a virus again. Government will save you.
[3:05:39.400 --> 3:05:41.400]  It's a takeover. It's the opposite.
[3:05:41.400 --> 3:05:44.400]  They're coming with forced inoculations on record.
[3:05:44.400 --> 3:05:46.400]  Reduce your fertility, lower your immunity.
[3:05:46.400 --> 3:05:48.400]  And in many cases, kill you.
[3:05:48.400 --> 3:06:17.400]  And they're telling you it's going to hurt a lot of people.
[3:06:17.400 --> 3:06:20.400]  Gerald Solente's about to take over in about 10 minutes.
[3:06:20.400 --> 3:06:23.400]  Lord Christopher Monkton, one of the smartest people I know,
[3:06:23.400 --> 3:06:26.400]  the guy that pioneered exposing globalism.
[3:06:26.400 --> 3:06:28.400]  Now we see the carbon being cut off.
[3:06:28.400 --> 3:06:32.400]  We see the U.N. saying between 30 and 130 million are about to die.
[3:06:32.400 --> 3:06:37.400]  I try to tell NPR hosts I've been on where they don't even want to hear about it.
[3:06:37.400 --> 3:06:39.400]  It's all just about COVID-19 hysteria.
[3:06:39.400 --> 3:06:43.400]  We're not saying there isn't some lab-made cold virus that's more deadly than usual.
[3:06:43.400 --> 3:06:45.400]  I'm not denying that.
[3:06:45.400 --> 3:06:48.400]  I'm not saying the hype and the fear is the hysteria.
[3:06:48.400 --> 3:06:50.400]  Lord Monkton, how do we navigate out of this?
[3:06:50.400 --> 3:06:53.400]  Who's to blame? What else do you expect to happen?
[3:06:53.400 --> 3:06:55.400]  What about those trying to blame President Trump?
[3:06:55.400 --> 3:07:00.400]  I'm not sycophantic. I get persecuted for supporting the president.
[3:07:00.400 --> 3:07:02.400]  But I still do what I think is right.
[3:07:02.400 --> 3:07:05.400]  And I don't think President Trump's done a bad job.
[3:07:05.400 --> 3:07:06.400]  What do you think?
[3:07:06.400 --> 3:07:08.400]  The president is doing his best.
[3:07:08.400 --> 3:07:10.400]  Like Boris Johnson on this side of the Atlantic,
[3:07:10.400 --> 3:07:15.400]  he was late in realizing how dangerous this virus actually is.
[3:07:15.400 --> 3:07:21.400]  And therefore, he didn't take the step of locking down the country in time.
[3:07:21.400 --> 3:07:24.400]  Once you fail to do what South Korea and Taiwan did,
[3:07:24.400 --> 3:07:28.400]  if you allow a virus as dangerous as this to go unchecked,
[3:07:28.400 --> 3:07:31.400]  then it will kill a lot of people.
[3:07:31.400 --> 3:07:36.400]  And one model we had here in the U.K. said it might have killed 40 million worldwide this year
[3:07:36.400 --> 3:07:38.400]  if it hadn't been stopped.
[3:07:38.400 --> 3:07:40.400]  But it actually has been stopped now.
[3:07:40.400 --> 3:07:46.400]  And so now we can move to end the lockdowns much faster
[3:07:46.400 --> 3:07:49.400]  than the Democrats would ever like to think.
[3:07:49.400 --> 3:07:52.400]  And a lot faster even than some Republicans would like to think.
[3:07:52.400 --> 3:07:55.400]  Of course, the extreme right-wing Republicans have been saying
[3:07:55.400 --> 3:07:57.400]  there shouldn't have been a lockdown in the first place.
[3:07:57.400 --> 3:08:00.400]  That, I'm afraid, I'm going to have to say this, Alex was wrong.
[3:08:00.400 --> 3:08:03.400]  The lockdowns were necessary in those countries.
[3:08:03.400 --> 3:08:07.400]  Well, I'm not bragging, but I personally advise the president
[3:08:07.400 --> 3:08:09.400]  that he had to do some lockdowns
[3:08:09.400 --> 3:08:11.400]  or he'd be blamed with the deaths that would come.
[3:08:11.400 --> 3:08:12.400]  I get deaths happen.
[3:08:12.400 --> 3:08:14.400]  However, it's no longer needed
[3:08:14.400 --> 3:08:18.400]  because the rate at which the infection is growing
[3:08:18.400 --> 3:08:20.400]  is dropping just about everywhere.
[3:08:20.400 --> 3:08:23.400]  In most places, it's dropped below replacement.
[3:08:23.400 --> 3:08:24.400]  So now the number is growing.
[3:08:24.400 --> 3:08:27.400]  Is it from the accurate that sunlight is coming in?
[3:08:27.400 --> 3:08:29.400]  Sunlight does kill it.
[3:08:29.400 --> 3:08:33.400]  So if you're out of doors, you're reasonably, though, not completely safe.
[3:08:33.400 --> 3:08:35.400]  You still want to avoid close contact.
[3:08:35.400 --> 3:08:39.400]  Keep 16 feet away from anybody else while you're out of doors.
[3:08:39.400 --> 3:08:42.400]  If you can, it's safer than the six-foot limit.
[3:08:42.400 --> 3:08:47.400]  And indoors, make sure that you wear very comprehensive clothing,
[3:08:47.400 --> 3:08:50.400]  wear gloves, which you should change frequently.
[3:08:50.400 --> 3:08:54.400]  These gloves you can throw away and wear some sort of face covering.
[3:08:54.400 --> 3:08:58.400]  And then if you're under 60 and you're not suffering
[3:08:58.400 --> 3:09:03.400]  from any of the well-known diseases that help this virus to kill you,
[3:09:03.400 --> 3:09:06.400]  diabetes is one, obesity is another.
[3:09:06.400 --> 3:09:09.400]  Smoking, interestingly, appears to be rather a good thing
[3:09:09.400 --> 3:09:11.400]  against this virus.
[3:09:11.400 --> 3:09:13.400]  That's still to be researched, but the early science...
[3:09:13.400 --> 3:09:16.400]  Because your lungs are used to being assaulted.
[3:09:16.400 --> 3:09:19.400]  So people who are smoking don't seem to be getting this
[3:09:19.400 --> 3:09:21.400]  as much as people who don't.
[3:09:21.400 --> 3:09:23.400]  And we don't yet know why.
[3:09:23.400 --> 3:09:25.400]  So I'm not giving that as medical advice.
[3:09:25.400 --> 3:09:26.400]  Let me be very clear. None of us are.
[3:09:26.400 --> 3:09:27.400]  I think I know why.
[3:09:27.400 --> 3:09:28.400]  I'm not giving medical advice,
[3:09:28.400 --> 3:09:31.400]  but there's an autoimmune response of the Spanish flu in 1918.
[3:09:31.400 --> 3:09:33.400]  I think people that are salting their lungs,
[3:09:33.400 --> 3:09:36.400]  the lungs just aren't insulted by the virus.
[3:09:36.400 --> 3:09:38.400]  But we don't yet know that.
[3:09:38.400 --> 3:09:40.400]  So let's not go there.
[3:09:40.400 --> 3:09:44.400]  But what we can say is that provided people...
[3:09:44.400 --> 3:09:46.400]  They now know this virus is dangerous.
[3:09:46.400 --> 3:09:47.400]  They can be trusted.
[3:09:47.400 --> 3:09:49.400]  I'm a great thing for trusting the people.
[3:09:49.400 --> 3:09:50.400]  Once they know the thing is dangerous,
[3:09:50.400 --> 3:09:51.400]  once we've dealt with the crisis
[3:09:51.400 --> 3:09:53.400]  and stopped the hospitals from being overwhelmed,
[3:09:53.400 --> 3:09:55.400]  we've now done.
[3:09:55.400 --> 3:09:57.400]  Now you can say to the young people,
[3:09:57.400 --> 3:10:01.400]  fine, go back to work, but be cautious about it.
[3:10:01.400 --> 3:10:03.400]  And to the old people like me,
[3:10:03.400 --> 3:10:06.400]  who are at risk from this virus,
[3:10:06.400 --> 3:10:09.400]  well, it's up to me to take my own precautions.
[3:10:09.400 --> 3:10:14.400]  I don't need the state to lock everybody else down for my sake.
[3:10:14.400 --> 3:10:16.400]  So it is now possible.
[3:10:16.400 --> 3:10:20.400]  I think immediately, really possible for every country
[3:10:20.400 --> 3:10:24.400]  where the rate of increase in what are called active cases,
[3:10:24.400 --> 3:10:26.400]  people actually now in hospital, is no longer...
[3:10:26.400 --> 3:10:27.400]  It's no longer great.
[3:10:27.400 --> 3:10:29.400]  They're now declining.
[3:10:29.400 --> 3:10:32.400]  Those countries can now safely begin
[3:10:32.400 --> 3:10:34.400]  unlocking their economies.
[3:10:34.400 --> 3:10:36.400]  And the sooner, the better.
[3:10:36.400 --> 3:10:37.400]  No, I agree. So in closing,
[3:10:37.400 --> 3:10:40.400]  what about the institutional attacks, though,
[3:10:40.400 --> 3:10:44.400]  on vitamin C, on D3, on zinc from the beginning?
[3:10:44.400 --> 3:10:47.400]  I mean, that just seems like they wanted to exacerbate this.
[3:10:47.400 --> 3:10:48.400]  Well, certainly in this country,
[3:10:48.400 --> 3:10:51.400]  we've had no attack on vitamin C.
[3:10:51.400 --> 3:10:52.400]  No, no, not there.
[3:10:52.400 --> 3:10:55.400]  I'm saying here, they're SWAT teaming medical doctors
[3:10:55.400 --> 3:10:56.400]  that are giving it.
[3:10:56.400 --> 3:10:57.400]  I'm not a big...
[3:10:57.400 --> 3:10:59.400]  Well, they shouldn't do that
[3:10:59.400 --> 3:11:01.400]  because although...
[3:11:01.400 --> 3:11:03.400]  I'm kind of a doctor phobe.
[3:11:03.400 --> 3:11:04.400]  But I read the statistic.
[3:11:04.400 --> 3:11:05.400]  It's good to say.
[3:11:05.400 --> 3:11:07.400]  You're starting to get vitamin C things every few months.
[3:11:07.400 --> 3:11:08.400]  I don't like that.
[3:11:08.400 --> 3:11:09.400]  They're amazing.
[3:11:09.400 --> 3:11:11.400]  Let's get this clear.
[3:11:11.400 --> 3:11:14.400]  We cannot say that if you take lots of vitamin C
[3:11:14.400 --> 3:11:16.400]  or vitamin D, this will cure you
[3:11:16.400 --> 3:11:18.400]  or prevent you ever getting sick.
[3:11:18.400 --> 3:11:20.400]  There is evidence that it helps.
[3:11:20.400 --> 3:11:22.400]  And if you're deficient in vitamin D3,
[3:11:22.400 --> 3:11:25.400]  then taking D3 helps a lot.
[3:11:25.400 --> 3:11:26.400]  It's very great...
[3:11:26.400 --> 3:11:27.400]  No, but listen to me.
[3:11:27.400 --> 3:11:28.400]  I agree with you.
[3:11:28.400 --> 3:11:29.400]  What I'm saying is,
[3:11:29.400 --> 3:11:31.400]  all over Europe, the U.S. the last 10 years,
[3:11:31.400 --> 3:11:33.400]  there are two within a mile from my house.
[3:11:33.400 --> 3:11:35.400]  Medical doctors there, I go in,
[3:11:35.400 --> 3:11:36.400]  they put a needle in my arm,
[3:11:36.400 --> 3:11:39.400]  I get vitamin C, I get B12,
[3:11:39.400 --> 3:11:41.400]  and I get other things.
[3:11:41.400 --> 3:11:42.400]  It's the way I quit drinking
[3:11:42.400 --> 3:11:43.400]  is they have this amino acid
[3:11:43.400 --> 3:11:44.400]  that makes you not want alcohol.
[3:11:44.400 --> 3:11:46.400]  They jammed that in my arm two years ago.
[3:11:46.400 --> 3:11:47.400]  I didn't want alcohol for six months.
[3:11:47.400 --> 3:11:49.400]  It made me stop drinking.
[3:11:49.400 --> 3:11:50.400]  There's a medical doctor doing it.
[3:11:50.400 --> 3:11:54.400]  They're now SWAT teaming these very facilities
[3:11:54.400 --> 3:11:56.400]  that have approved stuff that, like,
[3:11:56.400 --> 3:11:57.400]  changed my life.
[3:11:57.400 --> 3:12:00.400]  All I'm saying is, I'm a free person.
[3:12:00.400 --> 3:12:01.400]  I'm not using heroin.
[3:12:01.400 --> 3:12:03.400]  I'm not out using marijuana.
[3:12:03.400 --> 3:12:05.400]  Should I go to a medical doctor
[3:12:05.400 --> 3:12:07.400]  and be able to get what I want?
[3:12:07.400 --> 3:12:11.400]  The danger is that these health authorities
[3:12:11.400 --> 3:12:13.400]  are becoming too bossy.
[3:12:13.400 --> 3:12:16.400]  And they're trying to take away from doctors
[3:12:16.400 --> 3:12:18.400]  the ancient right which has existed
[3:12:18.400 --> 3:12:20.400]  since Hippocrates,
[3:12:20.400 --> 3:12:22.400]  and it's called the officinal formula
[3:12:22.400 --> 3:12:24.400]  by which any doctor can prescribe
[3:12:24.400 --> 3:12:26.400]  absolutely anything to a patient,
[3:12:26.400 --> 3:12:29.400]  provided that doctor in his professional training
[3:12:29.400 --> 3:12:31.400]  is convinced that that patient
[3:12:31.400 --> 3:12:34.400]  will benefit rather than suffer
[3:12:34.400 --> 3:12:36.400]  if he takes that particular substance.
[3:12:36.400 --> 3:12:37.400]  That's the rule.
[3:12:37.400 --> 3:12:39.400]  They're taking the power of the priesthood
[3:12:39.400 --> 3:12:45.400]  directly from the doctors in the practice
[3:12:45.400 --> 3:12:47.400]  to these computerized systems.
[3:12:47.400 --> 3:12:50.400]  They're trying to, but they can't overcome
[3:12:50.400 --> 3:12:51.400]  the officinal formula.
[3:12:51.400 --> 3:12:54.400]  When I was doing research into virology
[3:12:54.400 --> 3:12:58.400]  at one point, a global warming campaigner
[3:12:58.400 --> 3:13:00.400]  tried to make a complaint
[3:13:00.400 --> 3:13:03.400]  that I was conducting unauthorized clinical trials.
[3:13:03.400 --> 3:13:06.400]  And I had to speak to the medicines control agency,
[3:13:06.400 --> 3:13:08.400]  one of these great bureaucracies in Britain.
[3:13:08.400 --> 3:13:11.400]  And in the end, I had to order them to stand away.
[3:13:11.400 --> 3:13:14.400]  I said, look, we have to try out medications
[3:13:14.400 --> 3:13:17.400]  on small numbers of patients to find out
[3:13:17.400 --> 3:13:19.400]  whether we've got enough of an indication.
[3:13:19.400 --> 3:13:21.400]  Well, you had Trump passed a law going
[3:13:21.400 --> 3:13:23.400]  to put in an application.
[3:13:23.400 --> 3:13:24.400]  Let me finish the sentence.
[3:13:24.400 --> 3:13:27.400]  To put in an application for a clinical trial.
[3:13:27.400 --> 3:13:29.400]  And so I told them, get off my back
[3:13:29.400 --> 3:13:31.400]  or I'll go straight to the high court
[3:13:31.400 --> 3:13:32.400]  and have you shut down.
[3:13:32.400 --> 3:13:35.400]  And they retreated in very, very rapid order.
[3:13:35.400 --> 3:13:36.400]  No, but I agree.
[3:13:36.400 --> 3:13:39.400]  Trump talks about right to try.
[3:13:39.400 --> 3:13:42.400]  If you're a doctor watching this
[3:13:42.400 --> 3:13:45.400]  and you're being bullied by the health authorities
[3:13:45.400 --> 3:13:47.400]  because you think you want to prescribe
[3:13:47.400 --> 3:13:48.400]  something for a patient,
[3:13:48.400 --> 3:13:50.400]  which you in your professional judgment
[3:13:50.400 --> 3:13:52.400]  think is good for that patient,
[3:13:52.400 --> 3:13:54.400]  under the officinal formula, which is worldwide,
[3:13:54.400 --> 3:13:57.400]  nobody has been able to legislate against it.
[3:13:57.400 --> 3:14:00.400]  You are entitled to prescribe that medication
[3:14:00.400 --> 3:14:03.400]  and they are not allowed to tell you.
[3:14:03.400 --> 3:14:04.400]  Let me stop you in closing.
[3:14:04.400 --> 3:14:05.400]  As you get mad at me when I interrupt,
[3:14:05.400 --> 3:14:07.400]  which is so smart and I totally agree with you.
[3:14:07.400 --> 3:14:09.400]  The basic ancient rite of medicine,
[3:14:09.400 --> 3:14:10.400]  thousands of years old,
[3:14:10.400 --> 3:14:12.400]  says that you have these degrees, you've done it,
[3:14:12.400 --> 3:14:13.400]  you should be able to test it.
[3:14:13.400 --> 3:14:15.400]  If your peers find you wrong,
[3:14:15.400 --> 3:14:16.400]  you can get in trouble.
[3:14:16.400 --> 3:14:18.400]  So these bureaucracies coming in,
[3:14:18.400 --> 3:14:21.400]  the UN coming in and saying what doctors can do
[3:14:21.400 --> 3:14:25.400]  is a giant rape of those rites.
[3:14:25.400 --> 3:14:26.400]  That's exactly it.
[3:14:26.400 --> 3:14:27.400]  But they're not succeeding.
[3:14:27.400 --> 3:14:28.400]  The officinal formula,
[3:14:28.400 --> 3:14:30.400]  this rite of doctors to prescribe what they think
[3:14:30.400 --> 3:14:32.400]  will do their patient more good than harm.
[3:14:32.400 --> 3:14:36.400]  That rite is an unchallengeable, inalienable,
[3:14:36.400 --> 3:14:38.400]  necessary rite of the medical profession.
[3:14:38.400 --> 3:14:41.400]  I'm not a doctor, so I don't have that rite,
[3:14:41.400 --> 3:14:43.400]  but every doctor does have that rite
[3:14:43.400 --> 3:14:45.400]  and he should not be bullied
[3:14:45.400 --> 3:14:47.400]  into failing to exercise that rite.
[3:14:47.400 --> 3:14:49.400]  And if he remembers those magic words,
[3:14:49.400 --> 3:14:52.400]  officinal formula, he will find that the bureaucrats
[3:14:52.400 --> 3:14:54.400]  who've been trying to stop him will run a mile.
[3:14:54.400 --> 3:14:55.400]  So there's a tip,
[3:14:55.400 --> 3:14:59.400]  but just to wind up now on this wretched virus.
[3:14:59.400 --> 3:15:02.400]  Yes, the lockdowns can now be brought carefully
[3:15:02.400 --> 3:15:05.400]  and responsibly, but immediately to an end,
[3:15:05.400 --> 3:15:07.400]  particularly for those under 60.
[3:15:07.400 --> 3:15:09.400]  They can go straight back to work
[3:15:09.400 --> 3:15:11.400]  and just take sensible precautions.
[3:15:11.400 --> 3:15:14.400]  People can be trusted to do sensible things
[3:15:14.400 --> 3:15:16.400]  if you don't treat them like children,
[3:15:16.400 --> 3:15:18.400]  try to treat them like children
[3:15:18.400 --> 3:15:21.400]  and they will rebel and behave badly.
[3:15:21.400 --> 3:15:24.400]  So I say to the international authorities,
[3:15:24.400 --> 3:15:28.400]  start treating your populations like adults.
[3:15:28.400 --> 3:15:30.400]  We all understand that this virus
[3:15:30.400 --> 3:15:32.400]  is a lot more dangerous than flu.
[3:15:32.400 --> 3:15:34.400]  We didn't start with, we do now.
[3:15:34.400 --> 3:15:37.400]  Knowing this, you can trust us
[3:15:37.400 --> 3:15:39.400]  to be sensible about what we do
[3:15:39.400 --> 3:15:41.400]  and who we meet and how we meet them
[3:15:41.400 --> 3:15:43.400]  and how close we get to them.
[3:15:43.400 --> 3:15:45.400]  We're out of time, talk to you soon.
[3:15:45.400 --> 3:15:46.400]  We love you.
[3:15:46.400 --> 3:15:48.400]  Thank you so much. Stay with us.
[3:15:50.400 --> 3:15:51.400]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[3:15:51.400 --> 3:15:53.400]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago
[3:15:53.400 --> 3:15:55.400]  when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[3:15:55.400 --> 3:15:57.400]  I sued the IRS in one.
[3:15:57.400 --> 3:15:58.400]  I beat the IRS then
[3:15:58.400 --> 3:16:00.400]  and I've been beating them ever since.
[3:16:00.400 --> 3:16:01.400]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement
[3:16:01.400 --> 3:16:03.400]  and I've helped thousands of people
[3:16:03.400 --> 3:16:05.400]  deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[3:16:05.400 --> 3:16:07.400]  I can help you too.
[3:16:07.400 --> 3:16:08.400]  If you owe taxes you can't pay,
[3:16:08.400 --> 3:16:10.400]  don't wait another day.
[3:16:10.400 --> 3:16:12.400]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[3:16:12.400 --> 3:16:14.400]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX
[3:16:14.400 --> 3:16:16.400]  or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[3:16:16.400 --> 3:16:20.400]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[3:16:20.400 --> 3:16:23.400]  This is a Corona Crisis Self-Reliance Alert.
[3:16:23.400 --> 3:16:25.400]  If you're worried about the power grid
[3:16:25.400 --> 3:16:26.400]  and the current crisis
[3:16:26.400 --> 3:16:28.400]  and want to generate your own supply
[3:16:28.400 --> 3:16:30.400]  of off-the-grid electrical power,
[3:16:30.400 --> 3:16:32.400]  just in case, pay close attention.
[3:16:32.400 --> 3:16:33.400]  Here's why.
[3:16:33.400 --> 3:16:35.400]  A limited supply of solar backup generators
[3:16:35.400 --> 3:16:38.400]  will be available again in the next two weeks.
[3:16:38.400 --> 3:16:40.400]  These emergency backup systems
[3:16:40.400 --> 3:16:42.400]  provide life-saving electrical backup power
[3:16:42.400 --> 3:16:44.400]  when you get off the grid.
[3:16:44.400 --> 3:16:46.400]  And unlike gas generators,
[3:16:46.400 --> 3:16:48.400]  these solar generators run quietly,
[3:16:48.400 --> 3:16:49.400]  emit no fumes,
[3:16:49.400 --> 3:16:51.400]  and produce an endless supply
[3:16:51.400 --> 3:16:53.400]  of free electricity from the sun.
[3:16:53.400 --> 3:16:55.400]  Dangerous weather, social unrest,
[3:16:55.400 --> 3:16:57.400]  or overloaded grids this summer
[3:16:57.400 --> 3:16:59.400]  will not be a problem if you go to
[3:16:59.400 --> 3:17:01.400]  mysolarbackup.com
[3:17:01.400 --> 3:17:03.400]  and get your solar backup generator.
[3:17:03.400 --> 3:17:05.400]  We regret that supplies are limited
[3:17:05.400 --> 3:17:08.400]  and only available on a first-come-first-serve basis.
[3:17:08.400 --> 3:17:11.400]  Check availability at mysolarbackup.com.
[3:17:11.400 --> 3:17:14.400]  Never suffer painful power outages again.
[3:17:14.400 --> 3:17:16.400]  Go to mysolarbackup.com.
[3:17:16.400 --> 3:17:42.400]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[3:17:46.400 --> 3:17:50.400]  Get your bug assault today.
[3:18:16.400 --> 3:18:19.400]  They can take new orders and get it to you quickly.
[3:18:19.400 --> 3:18:21.400]  They'll probably have to suspend orders
[3:18:21.400 --> 3:18:23.400]  very, very soon again,
[3:18:23.400 --> 3:18:25.400]  because the lockdown of the economy
[3:18:25.400 --> 3:18:27.400]  is killing food distribution, farming,
[3:18:27.400 --> 3:18:29.400]  you name it, and now it's mainstream news
[3:18:29.400 --> 3:18:31.400]  that food shortages and delivery
[3:18:31.400 --> 3:18:33.400]  are already starting to happen.
[3:18:33.400 --> 3:18:35.400]  If Trump can turn the economy back on
[3:18:35.400 --> 3:18:38.400]  and rest control of our system away from the globalist,
[3:18:38.400 --> 3:18:40.400]  things may be okay,
[3:18:40.400 --> 3:18:42.400]  but it looks like it's going to get very, very rough.
[3:18:42.400 --> 3:18:44.400]  So again, ladies and gentlemen,
[3:18:44.400 --> 3:18:46.400]  make sure to secure the number one thing you need.
[3:18:46.400 --> 3:18:48.400]  High-quality, storeable food,
[3:18:48.400 --> 3:18:50.400]  ready to get to you and your family now
[3:18:50.400 --> 3:19:16.400]  at mysolarbackup.com.
[3:19:20.400 --> 3:19:22.400]  We're on the go.
[3:19:50.400 --> 3:19:57.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:21.400 --> 3:20:23.400]  We see the attack the president's under.
[3:20:23.400 --> 3:20:25.400]  You see the attack we're under.
[3:20:25.400 --> 3:20:27.400]  I just want to tell you, we're faithful
[3:20:27.400 --> 3:20:29.400]  and we'll hold the line until the end,
[3:20:29.400 --> 3:20:31.400]  until we win or until we break.
[3:20:31.400 --> 3:20:33.400]  But I'm not back down yet, folks.
[3:20:33.400 --> 3:20:35.400]  I can't.
[3:20:35.400 --> 3:20:37.400]  I think I've never felt stronger in this fight,
[3:20:37.400 --> 3:20:39.400]  but I realized I just did an hour and a half of radio
[3:20:39.400 --> 3:20:41.400]  and never plugged one thing.
[3:20:41.400 --> 3:20:43.400]  I'm my biggest enemy.
[3:20:43.400 --> 3:20:45.400]  If I plug every segment, we have plenty of money
[3:20:45.400 --> 3:20:47.400]  to fund this whole place.
[3:20:47.400 --> 3:20:49.400]  I end up going hours not plugging.
[3:20:49.400 --> 3:20:51.400]  Infowarstore.com
[3:20:51.400 --> 3:20:54.400]  X2, deep earth, high-quality I-9 crystals,
[3:20:54.400 --> 3:20:56.400]  an essential building block of the body.
[3:20:56.400 --> 3:20:58.400]  Nobody else that I know of has true deep-earth crystals
[3:20:58.400 --> 3:21:00.400]  of this purity.
[3:21:00.400 --> 3:21:02.400]  You have to get a DA license for us to even be able to get this.
[3:21:02.400 --> 3:21:07.400]  This is 50% off back in, sold out for almost two months.
[3:21:07.400 --> 3:21:09.400]  We've also got the new essential oils
[3:21:09.400 --> 3:21:11.400]  and three different flavors.
[3:21:11.400 --> 3:21:14.400]  Peppermint, eucalyptus, and, of course, lavender.
[3:21:14.400 --> 3:21:16.400]  That's back.
[3:21:16.400 --> 3:21:18.400]  It's a hand sanitizer with the essential oil.
[3:21:18.400 --> 3:21:22.300]  or operation and the storable food just something good to have 25 years it's in
[3:21:22.300 --> 3:21:26.660]  there you mix in with what you got it's a good default to make you know you see
[3:21:26.660 --> 3:21:30.420]  the stuff going on with General Flynn he was an advisor of the president so the
[3:21:30.420 --> 3:21:36.300]  FBI came and lied on 302 is about what he said and it's all come out I can tell
[3:21:36.300 --> 3:21:41.460]  you that soon you'll learn about it they're like hey you turn against Trump
[3:21:41.460 --> 3:21:44.780]  we're not gonna arrest you well go to hell man I'm not doing this I'm a good
[3:21:44.780 --> 3:21:49.400]  person I'm proud of actually who I've been in my life and so whatever you're
[3:21:49.400 --> 3:21:52.760]  gonna do go ahead and do it but it actually doesn't make me feel good I
[3:21:52.760 --> 3:21:56.360]  can call them talk to the president or talk to his advisors and then he responds
[3:21:56.360 --> 3:22:01.160]  it scares me he's totally surrounded folks and this country's totally
[3:22:01.160 --> 3:22:06.680]  surrounded and I just believe in your strength I believe your strength to say
[3:22:06.680 --> 3:22:11.800]  no to this your strength is to say no to the globalist the chai comms and in
[3:22:11.800 --> 3:22:14.280]  your strength to spread the word about Gerald Salante about to come up and
[3:22:14.280 --> 3:22:17.720]  everybody you know on Facebook and Twitter and Google but everybody from
[3:22:17.720 --> 3:22:23.080]  General Flynn to Roger Stone that has advised the president is indicted it's
[3:22:23.080 --> 3:22:29.120]  not like I'm even that smart I like oh mr. President here's the here's the video
[3:22:29.120 --> 3:22:33.120]  from Senor Sinai you mentioned we're either putting light in the lungs kills

[3:22:47.360 --> 3:22:51.880]  isn't like a power trip like we're this week that no one will even talk to the
[3:22:51.880 --> 3:22:57.840]  president he's so ice how do we get him into office we the people elected him
[3:22:57.840 --> 3:23:01.640]  and they're trying to repudiate all of us so Gerald Salante's gonna take over
[3:23:01.640 --> 3:23:05.640]  right now but I was talking to one of the top White House advisors this morning
[3:23:05.640 --> 3:23:11.200]  and they said send me a link you're really saying the Nobel Prize winner for
[3:23:11.200 --> 3:23:14.960]  HIV says it was man-made and I said it to them they go oh we'll get that rights
[3:23:14.960 --> 3:23:20.400]  to the president that's how paralyzed Trump is and that's why he needs we the
[3:23:20.400 --> 3:23:23.840]  people to get the word out to him so history's happening right now Gerald
[3:23:23.840 --> 3:23:28.640]  Salante thanks over thank you so much Gerald we love you no thanks to have me
[3:23:28.640 --> 3:23:33.720]  on Alex and thanks all that you do and you know my here's my take on the whole
[3:23:33.720 --> 3:23:39.520]  COVID thing with China look at it one of our top trends for 2020 remember these
[3:23:39.520 --> 3:23:43.840]  came out in December that's when we put our top trends for the new year and one
[3:23:43.840 --> 3:23:48.720]  of them was the New World Disorder there were protests going on around the
[3:23:48.720 --> 3:23:56.160]  world Hong Kong France Lebanon Algeria Chile
[3:23:56.160 --> 3:24:02.880]  Bolivia Peru India all over the world they couldn't stop it the big one was
[3:24:02.880 --> 3:24:10.040]  China with their inability to stop the protests going on in Hong Kong these
[3:24:10.040 --> 3:24:15.240]  things have been going on for months they couldn't put them down and I was on
[3:24:15.240 --> 3:24:21.560]  a number of Hong Kong TV shows throughout the period and I'm talking to
[3:24:21.560 --> 3:24:26.760]  these producers and other people off the air they couldn't stop it from
[3:24:26.760 --> 3:24:35.240]  happening and everything they did to try to stop it wasn't working all of a
[3:24:35.240 --> 3:24:46.840]  sudden COVID-19 COVID-19 and then you go back to January 28th our trends
[3:24:46.840 --> 3:24:55.640]  journal which of course now is a weekly and the headline read coronavirus 106
[3:24:55.640 --> 3:25:05.720]  dead in China 1.4 billion still alive so this is coming out and I'm saying what
[3:25:05.720 --> 3:25:12.760]  it why they telling me 106 people died in China of a virus when they when you
[3:25:12.760 --> 3:25:18.200]  got about 1.5 million a year that are dying air pollution they're walking
[3:25:18.200 --> 3:25:25.880]  around their masks all the time and his place is filthy and then all of a sudden
[3:25:25.880 --> 3:25:35.480]  the lockdowns happen again let's pretend that China or believe whatever you want
[3:25:35.480 --> 3:25:40.240]  to do because the motto of the trends journals think for yourself that they're
[3:25:40.240 --> 3:25:47.400]  cooking the books and a lot more people died let's say a million people died of
[3:25:47.400 --> 3:25:59.120]  COVID in China man-made made by bats whatever happened never let a critical
[3:25:59.120 --> 3:26:07.920]  issue go to waste all of a sudden the Chinese shut down the Hong Kong
[3:26:07.920 --> 3:26:16.560]  protests remember Hong Kong is the banking capital of Asia this thing was
[3:26:16.560 --> 3:26:22.640]  going down along with the Chinese equity markets they couldn't stop it but they
[3:26:22.640 --> 3:26:30.400]  stopped it with the COVID hysteria and then the Western media picked up on it
[3:26:30.400 --> 3:26:38.000]  as we're on the air right now what is it over 200,000 people have died around the
[3:26:38.000 --> 3:26:44.080]  world since this pandemonium panic broke out and of a global population of
[3:26:44.080 --> 3:26:55.000]  7.7 billion and again 1.5 a million died in China last year yes one drop of
[3:26:55.000 --> 3:27:00.600]  blood out of a human body sorry to interrupt it's a total hysteria exactly
[3:27:00.600 --> 3:27:07.480]  so here's what I'm saying Alex the Chinese invented it to do it to stop the
[3:27:07.480 --> 3:27:14.200]  Hong Kong riots they could not put them down and every government now is latched
[3:27:14.200 --> 3:27:20.920]  on to it hey look at India what do they have 1.3 billion people how many deaths
[3:27:20.920 --> 3:27:27.120]  are there under a thousand and look how filthy that joint is to live from your
[3:27:27.120 --> 3:27:32.640]  mouths of God's ears so it's a giant hysterical hoax confirms yep and the
[3:27:32.640 --> 3:27:37.400]  Chinese did it to stop the protest that were going on in China that they were
[3:27:37.400 --> 3:27:43.480]  unable to do no matter what they did they couldn't put them down this stopped
[3:27:43.480 --> 3:27:47.800]  them and the dictators all around the world did the same thing Chile
[3:27:47.800 --> 3:27:54.960]  Bolivia India France they all shut down the protest and the Chinese did it
[3:27:54.960 --> 3:28:00.920]  because that was the only way to stop it and the prostitute media picked up on
[3:28:00.920 --> 3:28:06.720]  it and the rest of the low-life politicians poly ticks many ticks in
[3:28:06.720 --> 3:28:11.040]  this country and others took advantage of it
[3:28:11.480 --> 3:28:15.920]  Gerald Salente you're on fire and that's it the statistics show it but despite
[3:28:15.920 --> 3:28:19.880]  the fact the hoax has now been proven to be a fraud we're being told to back it
[3:28:19.880 --> 3:28:24.440]  or we don't care because every death is our fault that's how they pose as the
[3:28:24.440 --> 3:28:28.200]  saviors of this whole thing Gerald Salente every step the people that are
[3:28:28.200 --> 3:28:32.720]  dying again the facts are all there they're elderly that are chronically ill
[3:28:32.720 --> 3:28:38.560]  they're obese they're suffering from diabetes lung disease respite are
[3:28:38.560 --> 3:28:43.200]  totally right so counter it we come back Gerald Salente the top friends

[3:29:49.600 --> 3:29:56.440]  the official numbers are now in the United States is in the biggest financial
[3:29:56.440 --> 3:30:01.360]  collapse in our history this is the worst employment collapse in US history by
[3:30:01.360 --> 3:30:06.040]  a very wide margin writes Michael Snyder the economic collapse block at this
[3:30:06.040 --> 3:30:09.960]  point we should no longer speak of economic collapse as something that
[3:30:09.960 --> 3:30:15.280]  will happen in the future it is now here and he does an excellent job in the
[3:30:15.280 --> 3:30:21.280]  article in fours.com of laying it out this was done by design Trump fought to
[3:30:21.280 --> 3:30:26.840]  open the economy but the hijacked blue cities and states with the tricombs and
[3:30:26.840 --> 3:30:31.480]  with Hollywood and the media held America underwater until we sucked it
[3:30:31.480 --> 3:30:36.840]  into our lungs and now we're lying there like a fish dying there's not much time
[3:30:36.840 --> 3:30:40.560]  to get the water out of our lungs so remember for decades to come when
[3:30:40.560 --> 3:30:44.720]  millions starve to death worldwide and you live in slums with no medicine the
[3:30:44.720 --> 3:30:50.240]  globalist did this the globalist did this the globalist did this the globalist
[3:30:50.240 --> 3:30:54.800]  did this one of our best-selling products is living defense and it's been
[3:30:54.800 --> 3:30:58.760]  sold out for over four months because it's hard to source the ingredients that
[3:30:58.760 --> 3:31:02.080]  are organic we've got a limited supply right now but it's selling out fast and
[3:31:02.080 --> 3:31:04.960]  I want those of you that haven't experienced living defense to get it for
[3:31:04.960 --> 3:31:08.920]  yourself here just part of one testimonial I looked in January 2016 I
[3:31:08.920 --> 3:31:12.760]  went in a hospital I went to VA hospital out here in Boyce and I was in until
[3:31:12.760 --> 3:31:16.800]  June and one of the only things that got me through that ordeal was listening to
[3:31:16.800 --> 3:31:21.160]  info wars three hours a day and I kept hearing doctor group and all you guys
[3:31:21.160 --> 3:31:24.760]  talking about living defense let me tell you something man I had an internal
[3:31:24.760 --> 3:31:28.720]  digestive problem and I suffered with it for about five or six years and the
[3:31:28.720 --> 3:31:32.120]  doctors they tried every time nobody could figure out what it is and then
[3:31:32.120 --> 3:31:35.320]  every day when I kept hearing you and doctor group and those commercials I
[3:31:35.320 --> 3:31:38.240]  said you know what I'm gonna get me some of that freaking living defense now I
[3:31:38.240 --> 3:31:40.840]  wasn't supposed to have any nutritional because they don't want you to have a
[3:31:40.840 --> 3:31:44.760]  stuff but I ordered it had it shipped to me I got it I hid it from the nurses I
[3:31:44.760 --> 3:31:49.680]  started taking it man that stuff changed my life it saved my life Alex Jones and
[3:31:49.680 --> 3:31:55.760]  info wars saved my life it doesn't matter how hard I want to fight if others
[3:31:55.760 --> 3:31:59.320]  human beings don't resonate with what I'm saying if you don't spread the word if
[3:31:59.320 --> 3:32:03.400]  you don't buy the products to fund our operation the dog doesn't hunt but you
[3:32:03.400 --> 3:32:08.040]  get that you are patriots you are people that live and work in the real world
[3:32:08.040 --> 3:32:11.400]  erase color green and understand what's happening and that's why when you call
[3:32:11.400 --> 3:32:15.480]  in and thank me for what I've done it's really a sick joke thank you for what
[3:32:15.480 --> 3:32:18.800]  you've done we're all of this together we believe in the rights of the unborn we
[3:32:18.800 --> 3:32:21.920]  believe in families we believe in the right to self-defense we believe in
[3:32:21.920 --> 3:32:26.400]  capitalism America and Jesus Christ number one and we believe in free speech
[3:32:26.400 --> 3:32:31.000]  and so the fact that you shop with us and the fact that you spread the word
[3:32:31.000 --> 3:32:35.520]  about what we're doing does everything in the world that's why I salute you and
[3:32:35.520 --> 3:32:39.040]  I thank you continually because the globalist thought they'd have this whole
[3:32:39.040 --> 3:32:42.240]  planet sewn up by now they thought they'd be in charge they thought that
[3:32:42.240 --> 3:32:46.920]  would have won but they didn't count on you and I and others coming together so
[3:32:46.920 --> 3:32:49.760]  God bless you
[3:32:49.760 --> 3:32:59.960]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:32:59.960 --> 3:33:22.240]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show and now your host Gerald Solente
[3:33:22.240 --> 3:33:29.320]  hello hello great to be on with the Alex Jones show thank you for why can't be
[3:33:29.320 --> 3:33:34.120]  happy I gotta be miserable they take enjoy our life you could get arrested if
[3:33:34.120 --> 3:33:42.880]  you're too happy can't have a good time anymore no no no yeah again the facts are
[3:33:42.880 --> 3:33:54.040]  all here death toll spikes at nursing homes from the toilet paper record
[3:33:54.040 --> 3:34:03.680]  diabetes lung and heart disease common in US coronavirus patients writers that's
[3:34:03.680 --> 3:34:08.400]  according to the Centers of Disease Control but I'm reading to you from
[3:34:08.400 --> 3:34:16.600]  stuff that happened back in March and weeks ago it's all forgotten coronavirus
[3:34:16.600 --> 3:34:23.960]  particularly unkind to those who are obese another Reuters story now let's
[3:34:23.960 --> 3:34:30.840]  take a look at this who's dying from the coronavirus and they say like that
[3:34:30.840 --> 3:34:38.440]  little boy over here the daddy's boy Andrew Cuomo the governor of New York
[3:34:38.440 --> 3:34:44.320]  on third base and thought he had a home run that Cuomo going on about you don't
[3:34:44.320 --> 3:34:50.400]  care about who dies but he dies you know yeah there he is the daddy boy who
[3:34:50.400 --> 3:34:55.920]  renamed the Tappancy Bridge in Mario Cuomo Bridge like his father's better
[3:34:55.920 --> 3:35:04.600]  than mine take it easy junior so talking about the hoax that's being put on us
[3:35:04.600 --> 3:35:09.600]  look at his other little brother there the the Chrissy Cuomo on the Cartoon
[3:35:09.600 --> 3:35:19.600]  News Network CNN if it was so deadly Andy your brother would be dead again the
[3:35:19.600 --> 3:35:24.840]  facts are there we detail it in the trends journal week after week it's a
[3:35:24.840 --> 3:35:36.440]  weekly magazine all the data is there elderly chronically ill and again the
[3:35:36.440 --> 3:35:42.480]  numbers are there now the Wall Street Journal reported that out of the 55,000
[3:35:42.480 --> 3:35:48.280]  or 50,000 plus people who died in America well over 10,000 often elder care
[3:35:48.280 --> 3:35:54.440]  from the reports that came in already that were chronically ill but a number
[3:35:54.440 --> 3:36:00.840]  of states including Washington and California and numbers of others aren't
[3:36:00.840 --> 3:36:06.480]  reporting the dead coming out of elder care homes and let's go back to the
[3:36:06.480 --> 3:36:15.600]  beginning of this where did they die first in Washington state and where did
[3:36:15.600 --> 3:36:26.600]  they die in Washington state at elder care homes Kirkland Washington again
[3:36:26.600 --> 3:36:38.160]  obese diabetics huh America obese you know one of my lines is you ever hear
[3:36:38.160 --> 3:36:47.560]  the expression pigs can't fly you've been to the airport lately 42% of
[3:36:47.560 --> 3:37:03.200]  Americans are obese 70% 70% are overweight this is what's killing the
[3:37:03.200 --> 3:37:10.040]  people these are the people that should be quarantined not the healthy people and
[3:37:10.040 --> 3:37:15.240]  even at the numbers they're putting out there and again we know the numbers are
[3:37:15.240 --> 3:37:21.440]  fake a detailed in the trends journal I'm sure it's been on info wars as well
[3:37:21.440 --> 3:37:28.440]  the doctor from Minnesota and showing the details several weeks ago how this
[3:37:28.440 --> 3:37:36.600]  Centers of Disease control put out if it's expected not proven lock it off as
[3:37:36.600 --> 3:37:44.120]  COVID-19 because then you'll get extra money for the hospitals if it's a
[3:37:44.120 --> 3:37:54.560]  COVID-19 death so even this low number again you're looking at 50 some thousand
[3:37:54.560 --> 3:38:05.240]  dead in a population of 330 million adds up to not a lot and again when you
[3:38:05.240 --> 3:38:10.760]  look at the other numbers what is it 840,000 people died of smoke related
[3:38:10.760 --> 3:38:20.280]  diseases last year already the Centers of Disease control are saying that almost
[3:38:20.280 --> 3:38:27.320]  60,000 people in the United States have already died of the flu so the numbers
[3:38:27.320 --> 3:38:32.080]  are all cooked and if you're going to isolate and quarantine everybody then
[3:38:32.080 --> 3:38:40.240]  isolate the people that are ill and that can be you know subjected to this to
[3:38:40.240 --> 3:38:45.280]  show you how much they're lying and it's not only the United States it's
[3:38:45.280 --> 3:38:57.440]  worldwide this is from Euro news this is out of Belgium country of 11 million
[3:38:57.440 --> 3:39:04.200]  people have over 6,200 recorded coronavirus related deaths you're ready
[3:39:04.200 --> 3:39:11.880]  for this just as I've been saying more than half of those deaths were recorded
[3:39:11.880 --> 3:39:20.000]  in retirement homes is the punchline and of the total deaths that are cut in
[3:39:20.000 --> 3:39:33.440]  those homes 4% were cases confirmed by a coronavirus test 96% were suspected
[3:39:33.440 --> 3:39:47.160]  ones they lie you got it they're lying this is a takeover it's a takeover by the
[3:39:47.160 --> 3:39:53.320]  sick politicians that a power-hungry freaks
[3:39:53.320 --> 3:40:04.880]  the cover of the new Trends Journal coming out it's going to be dumb enough to
[3:40:04.880 --> 3:40:12.720]  believe George Bush's wars and a great illustration by Anthony Frieda who's
[3:40:12.720 --> 3:40:17.240]  been on Alex Jones show down took a chip down there it does a lot of work for
[3:40:17.240 --> 3:40:22.800]  us in the Trends Journal he has a great Anthony Freida of George Bush that looks
[3:40:22.800 --> 3:40:30.360]  like Alfred E. Newman dumb enough to believe Bush's wars dumb enough to
[3:40:30.360 --> 3:40:44.240]  believe COVID-19 ones and just as these low-life slimy pathological lying
[3:40:44.240 --> 3:40:51.520]  psychopaths and sociopathical politicians don't have an exit strategy to
[3:40:51.520 --> 3:40:57.480]  get us out of the wars that they start overseas they don't have an exit strategy
[3:40:57.480 --> 3:41:04.560]  for the COVID war we are entering the greatest depression it's already begun
[3:41:04.560 --> 3:41:11.240]  by the way we're going to be doing a webinar you could go to TrendsJournal.com
[3:41:11.240 --> 3:41:20.880]  and sign up for a TrendsJournal.com it's coming Thursday April 30th and we'll be
[3:41:20.880 --> 3:41:26.480]  taking questions and answers help people prepare for the future because this is
[3:41:26.480 --> 3:41:31.400]  coming down like nothing we've ever seen before and if we don't fight for our
[3:41:31.400 --> 3:41:37.480]  freedom now we are going to die in war history is repeating itself I've said
[3:41:37.480 --> 3:41:47.760]  this before you had currency wars trade war with Japan back in the 1930s the
[3:41:47.760 --> 3:41:52.920]  Great Depression World War two we had currency wars and trade wars with China
[3:41:52.920 --> 3:41:58.840]  the greatest depression has begun when all else fails they take you to war
[3:41:58.840 --> 3:42:04.080]  World War three will be the war to end all wars because it'll end all life on
[3:42:04.080 --> 3:42:10.400]  earth or most of it it'll be the war that Albert Einstein warned us about they
[3:42:10.400 --> 3:42:16.480]  asked him what kind of be weapons will be used to fight the third World War this
[3:42:16.480 --> 3:42:21.440]  is a cat with the atomic bomb right he said I don't know he said but he'll be
[3:42:21.440 --> 3:42:27.760]  using sticks and stones to fight the fourth if we don't stand up and fight
[3:42:27.760 --> 3:42:33.120]  for freedom to fight for our constitutional and bill of rights we
[3:42:33.120 --> 3:42:39.480]  have these moronic psychopathic sickos the George W. Bushes of the world two
[3:42:39.480 --> 3:42:45.800]  point oh that are gonna kill us if we don't fight for freedom and I am a
[3:42:45.800 --> 3:42:52.160]  warrior for the prince of peace we'll be right back I'm always excited about in
[3:42:52.160 --> 3:42:54.880]  fours life products they're amazing they're cutting-edge you love them I
[3:42:54.880 --> 3:42:59.240]  love them and they find the info war in the face of the globalist onslaught but
[3:42:59.240 --> 3:43:05.960]  we have come up with a new product over a year in development that is amazing the
[3:43:05.960 --> 3:43:12.240]  only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on
[3:43:12.240 --> 3:43:18.760]  top of it and there's another innovation it's the spray cap it doesn't just pour
[3:43:18.760 --> 3:43:24.840]  out a bunch of thick gross goo but it's high-quality and aerosolizes it in a
[3:43:24.840 --> 3:43:28.920]  really great way I like to put on my hands rub a little my face it's got
[3:43:28.920 --> 3:43:32.680]  organic alcohol in it so spray it around your eyes but I just love it
[3:43:32.680 --> 3:43:37.120]  personally has something that's a moisturizer as well so this is a real
[3:43:37.120 --> 3:43:39.720]  innovation I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand
[3:43:39.720 --> 3:43:43.920]  sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it so it doesn't dry you out
[3:43:43.920 --> 3:43:50.120]  smells great it's so refreshing this is a big winner
[3:43:51.720 --> 3:43:58.920]  what are champions made of here's a man who can show you
[3:43:58.920 --> 3:44:06.320] 楊 been landed three one three nine
[3:44:12.240 --> 3:44:16.800]  three three nine
[3:44:16.800 --> 3:44:20.000]  Triple A 253 3139 is the info war store hotline
[3:44:20.000 --> 3:44:23.000]  Triple A 253 3139 is the info war store
[3:44:23.000 --> 3:44:23.260]  FIRE!
[3:44:23.260 --> 3:44:25.060]  Triple A 253 3139
[3:44:25.060 --> 3:44:26.580]  is the info war store hotline
[3:44:26.580 --> 3:44:29.940]  Triple A 253 3139 is the info war store
[3:44:29.940 --> 3:44:32.940]  infowarstore.com is simply the best
[3:44:32.940 --> 3:44:36.600]  infowarstore.com beats out all the rest
[3:44:36.600 --> 3:44:38.380]  Triple A 253 3139
[3:44:38.380 --> 3:44:39.920]  treble A 253 3139
[3:44:39.920 --> 3:44:41.460]  triple A 253 3139
[3:44:41.460 --> 3:44:43.240]  is the info war store hotline
[3:44:43.240 --> 3:44:44.940]  Triple A 253 3139
[3:44:44.940 --> 3:44:53.940]  How do you put a people under house arrest?
[3:44:53.940 --> 3:44:55.940]  How do you put them under siege?
[3:44:55.940 --> 3:45:00.940]  Well, you tell them you're protecting them from a virus that you yourself cooked up with
[3:45:00.940 --> 3:45:06.340]  the globalist deep state and then had China release to then take down the populist president
[3:45:06.340 --> 3:45:09.940]  and those pesky American people that have become too uppity.
[3:45:09.940 --> 3:45:11.940]  Bill Ma or even admitted it.
[3:45:11.940 --> 3:45:13.940]  Man, I hope we have a depression.
[3:45:13.940 --> 3:45:20.940]  They've tailored the whole thing where the big corporations and the media are going to keep the country closed
[3:45:20.940 --> 3:45:26.940]  along with the help of the blue cities and blue states all the time blaming Trump and capitalism and Americanism
[3:45:26.940 --> 3:45:28.940]  for the depression it creates.
[3:45:28.940 --> 3:45:31.940]  If America is that stupid, we deserve what happens to us.
[3:45:31.940 --> 3:45:34.940]  But as for me, I'm not sitting here and I'm not taking it.
[3:45:34.940 --> 3:45:39.940]  It's all the nanny state and the peer pressure that they're the good people keeping everybody safe.
[3:45:39.940 --> 3:45:41.940]  But that's not what they're doing.
[3:45:41.940 --> 3:45:48.940]  They are pulling America up by its roots and irrevocably damaging our savings, our health, our whole world
[3:45:48.940 --> 3:45:51.940]  and committing millions of third world people to death.
[3:45:51.940 --> 3:45:57.940]  The superpower that I have is that I tell you what I really think even if it ends up hurting me short term.
[3:45:57.940 --> 3:45:59.940]  I believe in God and I believe in the long run.
[3:45:59.940 --> 3:46:03.940]  It'll end up being better for myself and everybody else in this world we live together in.
[3:46:03.940 --> 3:46:05.940]  I understand what comes around, what goes around.
[3:46:05.940 --> 3:46:09.940]  You report you so and I live that and I fundamentally at a cellular level understand it.
[3:46:09.940 --> 3:46:15.940]  Now, if I would have hyped up the virus was going to kill 3, 4, 5 million people like the UN did,
[3:46:15.940 --> 3:46:17.940]  I would have sold five times more supplements.
[3:46:17.940 --> 3:46:19.940]  But you know what, I didn't do that.
[3:46:19.940 --> 3:46:25.940]  But I said on a routine basis, regardless, people are vitamin D deficient, people are deficient.
[3:46:25.940 --> 3:46:27.940]  And I had died and so many other issues.
[3:46:27.940 --> 3:46:29.940]  You need those products regardless.
[3:46:29.940 --> 3:46:33.940]  So when we started selling out of vitamin, mineral fusion, all the other products,
[3:46:33.940 --> 3:46:40.940]  we cut the prices from 30% off to 60% off because I knew it was the right thing to do during a crisis
[3:46:40.940 --> 3:46:44.940]  to make sure people were incentivized to up their bodies defenses.
[3:46:44.940 --> 3:47:13.940]  But now I'm telling you, with the economic crisis going on, get your storable food now.
[3:47:13.940 --> 3:47:19.940]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[3:47:19.940 --> 3:47:25.940]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show with Gerald Salente.
[3:47:25.940 --> 3:47:28.940]  Hello, hello.
[3:47:28.940 --> 3:47:31.940]  Great to be on the Alex Jones show.
[3:47:31.940 --> 3:47:35.940]  And remember, do what you can to support info wars.
[3:47:35.940 --> 3:47:37.940]  We got a fight for freedom.
[3:47:37.940 --> 3:47:41.940]  And this is one of the places to do it.
[3:47:41.940 --> 3:47:43.940]  The Trends Journal is the other one.
[3:47:43.940 --> 3:47:51.940]  So do what you can and survival shield X2 is back in stock and 50% off.
[3:47:51.940 --> 3:47:57.940]  You know, the globalists want you to be run down and unhealthy so they could dominate your life
[3:47:57.940 --> 3:47:59.940]  and you're seeing it right now.
[3:47:59.940 --> 3:48:03.940]  So fight back with one of nature's greatest essentials.
[3:48:03.940 --> 3:48:09.940]  Survival Shield X2 is now back in stock and 50% off.
[3:48:09.940 --> 3:48:13.940]  You know, the 1920s, the medical establishment was clear.
[3:48:13.940 --> 3:48:15.940]  You need iodine to live.
[3:48:15.940 --> 3:48:17.940]  Without it, you'll die.
[3:48:17.940 --> 3:48:22.940]  Or the very least, you'll probably have a reduced IQ.
[3:48:22.940 --> 3:48:26.940]  I guess George W. Bush never had a dose of iodine.
[3:48:26.940 --> 3:48:31.940]  But even today, iodine deficiency is still a serious problem.
[3:48:31.940 --> 3:48:32.940]  You bet it is.
[3:48:32.940 --> 3:48:34.940]  Look how dumb everybody is.
[3:48:34.940 --> 3:48:39.940]  The World Health Organization estimates that nearly 50 million people will suffer
[3:48:39.940 --> 3:48:45.940]  from some kind of mental impairment related to iodine deficiency.
[3:48:45.940 --> 3:48:48.940]  They should be pumping up the whole world with iodine
[3:48:48.940 --> 3:48:53.940]  because we got a mental deficiency by all the morons believe in the garbage
[3:48:53.940 --> 3:48:58.940]  coming out from the mainstream media about COVID-19.
[3:48:58.940 --> 3:49:02.940]  So get your survival shield X2.
[3:49:02.940 --> 3:49:04.940]  It's back in stock.
[3:49:04.940 --> 3:49:09.940]  Go to infowarsstores.com and read the reviews.
[3:49:09.940 --> 3:49:15.940]  Discover the shocking facts behind nascent iodine to secure your bottle today
[3:49:15.940 --> 3:49:17.940]  at 50% off.
[3:49:17.940 --> 3:49:21.940]  And again, while supplies last.
[3:49:21.940 --> 3:49:25.940]  And you can see how the supplies of important things are going away
[3:49:25.940 --> 3:49:27.940]  and how hard it is to get them back.
[3:49:27.940 --> 3:49:29.940]  So get it now.
[3:49:29.940 --> 3:49:36.940]  Stay on the health issue of the COVID-19 because their prostitutes say nothing about it.
[3:49:36.940 --> 3:49:43.940]  One of our other top trends for 2020 was homeless and helpless.
[3:49:43.940 --> 3:49:50.940]  How about the homeless epidemic was really sweeping the United States and a lot of the world.
[3:49:50.940 --> 3:49:53.940]  As I mentioned, a new world disorder, people were demonstrating everywhere
[3:49:53.940 --> 3:49:58.940]  because of poverty, lack of basic living conditions, etc.
[3:49:58.940 --> 3:50:09.940]  If the COVID-19 was as deadly as the low life newsrooms over there in California,
[3:50:09.940 --> 3:50:17.940]  who our staff called up for a week trying to get the quote from him when he said
[3:50:17.940 --> 3:50:21.940]  his decisions are based on scientific data to get the scientific data.
[3:50:21.940 --> 3:50:23.940]  They gave us back nothing.
[3:50:23.940 --> 3:50:26.940]  They gave us back more of his BFs.
[3:50:26.940 --> 3:50:35.940]  If it was so deadly, all those homeless people, very not socially distanced,
[3:50:35.940 --> 3:50:43.940]  would be dead all over the place according to the little low life prostitutes
[3:50:43.940 --> 3:50:48.940]  and the governors of a state near you.
[3:50:48.940 --> 3:50:57.940]  Why aren't the homeless packing the hospital?
[3:50:57.940 --> 3:50:59.940]  There they are.
[3:50:59.940 --> 3:51:01.940]  No social distancing.
[3:51:01.940 --> 3:51:03.940]  And that's another thing.
[3:51:03.940 --> 3:51:06.940]  They made up this social distancing stuff.
[3:51:06.940 --> 3:51:09.940]  There's no hard data on that.
[3:51:09.940 --> 3:51:12.940]  It's as phony as the other numbers they gave.
[3:51:12.940 --> 3:51:16.940]  Remember, this is going to kill 2 million people when it broke out.
[3:51:16.940 --> 3:51:20.940]  And that other low life piece of garbage crap, fouchy.
[3:51:20.940 --> 3:51:25.940]  Yeah, keep the F and put another couple of U's and C's in there.
[3:51:25.940 --> 3:51:27.940]  And that's who he is.
[3:51:27.940 --> 3:51:29.940]  Yeah, remember how many were going to die?
[3:51:29.940 --> 3:51:30.940]  Now it's down to what?
[3:51:30.940 --> 3:51:32.940]  Sixty something thousand.
[3:51:32.940 --> 3:51:34.940]  Yes, next year it's going to get worse.
[3:51:34.940 --> 3:51:36.940]  It'll keep spreading more fear.
[3:51:36.940 --> 3:51:40.940]  This little low life, a little sell out boy.
[3:51:40.940 --> 3:51:43.940]  Sell out to the big farmer.
[3:51:43.940 --> 3:51:48.940]  You had a big farmer with a little, you know what?
[3:51:48.940 --> 3:51:52.940]  One freak after another running and ruining our lives.
[3:51:52.940 --> 3:51:55.940]  Staying on the data.
[3:51:55.940 --> 3:52:01.940]  So far in the United States, according to the data for the Centers of Disease Control,
[3:52:01.940 --> 3:52:07.940]  fatalities were highest in persons aged 85 and older.
[3:52:07.940 --> 3:52:09.940]  It's all there.
[3:52:09.940 --> 3:52:13.940]  Diabetes, lung and heart disease common in U.S.
[3:52:13.940 --> 3:52:15.940]  coronavirus patients.
[3:52:15.940 --> 3:52:18.940]  Centers for Disease Control.
[3:52:18.940 --> 3:52:24.940]  Again, the obese.
[3:52:24.940 --> 3:52:30.940]  And look at the places where they haven't locked down.
[3:52:30.940 --> 3:52:32.940]  Sweden.
[3:52:32.940 --> 3:52:34.940]  They're still sweet and sweet and they're going out.
[3:52:34.940 --> 3:52:37.940]  Oh, something's closed down a little bit.
[3:52:37.940 --> 3:52:40.940]  They've been having the time of their life like they used to.
[3:52:40.940 --> 3:52:46.940]  Hey, Taiwan, whoop, opened up.
[3:52:46.940 --> 3:52:48.940]  Japan, very low rate.
[3:52:48.940 --> 3:52:52.940]  They didn't go into a major lockdown.
[3:52:52.940 --> 3:52:57.940]  Americans are dying because of their health.
[3:52:57.940 --> 3:53:00.940]  We are one of the most unhealthy nations in the world.
[3:53:00.940 --> 3:53:07.940]  One of our 2019 top trends was ready to explode.
[3:53:07.940 --> 3:53:17.940]  About the weight and obesity and diabetic problems in the United States and all the implications from it.
[3:53:17.940 --> 3:53:20.940]  Keep gobbling down those big Macs.
[3:53:20.940 --> 3:53:22.940]  Matter of fact, staying on that.
[3:53:22.940 --> 3:53:25.940]  Domino sales are going up.
[3:53:25.940 --> 3:53:27.940]  That's right.
[3:53:27.940 --> 3:53:33.940]  We're going to get more Domino's pizza as an Italian model to me.
[3:53:33.940 --> 3:53:37.940]  If anybody ate a piece of Domino's, they were going,
[3:53:37.940 --> 3:53:39.940]  get out of here.
[3:53:39.940 --> 3:53:42.940]  That's the stuff that people are reading.
[3:53:42.940 --> 3:53:45.940]  What do you think?
[3:53:45.940 --> 3:53:48.940]  Look at the junk that people are reading.
[3:53:48.940 --> 3:53:50.940]  That's what's killing them.
[3:53:50.940 --> 3:53:59.940]  If the homeless were susceptible to this, the hospitals would be packed.
[3:53:59.940 --> 3:54:06.940]  So, another country that's closed down, that hasn't closed down.
[3:54:06.940 --> 3:54:11.940]  And I believe at this time they have about 70 people dead out of a population.
[3:54:11.940 --> 3:54:13.940]  I'm going to guess.
[3:54:13.940 --> 3:54:18.940]  It's around 10 or 11 million.
[3:54:18.940 --> 3:54:22.940]  A place called Belarus.
[3:54:22.940 --> 3:54:28.940]  No lockdown at all.
[3:54:28.940 --> 3:54:29.940]  A handful of dead.
[3:54:29.940 --> 3:54:32.940]  So, here's the way the toilet paper or record.
[3:54:32.940 --> 3:54:37.940]  They would never write this about Sweden.
[3:54:37.940 --> 3:54:38.940]  10 million.
[3:54:38.940 --> 3:54:39.940]  Nine and a half million.
[3:54:39.940 --> 3:54:40.940]  I was close.
[3:54:40.940 --> 3:54:42.940]  They said 11.
[3:54:42.940 --> 3:54:47.940]  Here's the headline from the toilet paper of record in yesterday's paper.
[3:54:47.940 --> 3:54:56.940]  An autocrat sets his nation apart by imposing no restrictions at all.
[3:54:56.940 --> 3:54:58.940]  A big story.
[3:54:58.940 --> 3:55:00.940]  Look at this.
[3:55:00.940 --> 3:55:08.940]  How dare, how dare he let the people be free?
[3:55:08.940 --> 3:55:12.940]  How dare he?
[3:55:12.940 --> 3:55:14.940]  An autocrat.
[3:55:14.940 --> 3:55:17.940]  We don't have autocrats here.
[3:55:17.940 --> 3:55:21.940]  No, we got little slime balls here.
[3:55:21.940 --> 3:55:24.940]  We got little Andy Cuomo.
[3:55:24.940 --> 3:55:29.940]  This little guy.
[3:55:29.940 --> 3:55:34.940]  He, again, it's in the trends journal on March 2nd.
[3:55:34.940 --> 3:55:42.940]  On March 3rd, he put into legislation that in case of a health crisis,
[3:55:42.940 --> 3:55:46.940]  we would have executive order to rule over us.
[3:55:46.940 --> 3:55:49.940]  And boy is he doing it.
[3:55:49.940 --> 3:55:56.940]  And look at all the stupid people that believe this low life piece of garbage
[3:55:56.940 --> 3:56:02.940]  that has destroyed the lives of millions of people.
[3:56:02.940 --> 3:56:05.940]  Closing down businesses everywhere.
[3:56:05.940 --> 3:56:08.940]  Putting people out of work, out on the streets.
[3:56:08.940 --> 3:56:09.940]  Can't pay their rent.
[3:56:09.940 --> 3:56:11.940]  Can't pay their taxes.
[3:56:11.940 --> 3:56:13.940]  Him and his little brother don't care.
[3:56:13.940 --> 3:56:15.940]  They got the millions.
[3:56:15.940 --> 3:56:19.940]  And like all these politicians, they could care less.
[3:56:19.940 --> 3:56:22.940]  They steal our money in the name of taxes.
[3:56:22.940 --> 3:56:25.940]  They don't have to worry about being out of work.
[3:56:25.940 --> 3:56:30.940]  But yet they make fun of a guy from Belarus because he says to the people,
[3:56:30.940 --> 3:56:34.940]  hey, live your life the way you want to live it.
[3:56:34.940 --> 3:56:37.940]  And here's one of his quotes.
[3:56:37.940 --> 3:56:41.940]  And going back to who's dying, most of the people obese.
[3:56:41.940 --> 3:56:47.940]  Mr. Lukashenko noted that one Belarus victim was fat.
[3:56:47.940 --> 3:56:51.940]  The man weighed 297 pounds, he said.
[3:56:51.940 --> 3:56:56.940]  Quote, how can you even live that way?
[3:56:56.940 --> 3:57:01.940]  The virus attacks the weak.
[3:57:01.940 --> 3:57:04.940]  The virus attacks the weak.
[3:57:04.940 --> 3:57:07.940]  And we have to be strong.
[3:57:07.940 --> 3:57:12.940]  We have to stand up and fight for freedom.
[3:57:12.940 --> 3:57:17.940]  Because if we don't, we're going to die in war.
[3:57:17.940 --> 3:57:20.940]  And again, I'm a warrior of the Prince of Peace.
[3:57:20.940 --> 3:57:25.940]  And don't forget this coming Thursday, go to trendsjournal.com,
