[00:00:04.827 --> 00:00:09.670]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.251]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.251 --> 00:00:12.812]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.812 --> 00:00:16.995]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.995 --> 00:00:21.058]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.506 --> 00:00:34.200]  Well, this is going to be quite a send-off for the week, this Friday edition, the 9th day of July, 2010.
[00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:38.510]  Ted Nugent.
[00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.392]  He's joined us many times over the last 12 years or so.
[00:00:41.392 --> 00:00:43.353]  He's going to be popping in.
[00:00:43.353 --> 00:00:45.054]  It's been a few years since I've talked to Ted.
[00:00:45.054 --> 00:00:47.896]  He's going to be coming up in the middle of the next hour.
[00:00:47.896 --> 00:00:53.479]  Then our weekly visit with Bob Chapman to cover all the things happening in the economy.
[00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:56.021]  And Sheriff Babu is also going to be on.
[00:00:56.021 --> 00:00:59.063]  He's been begging for help from the federal government.
[00:01:00.956 --> 00:01:05.717]  And he has, of course, a Mexican mafia hit out on him, which is very, very serious.
[00:01:05.717 --> 00:01:09.638]  And if we had more sheriffs like Sheriff Babu, we could save this country.
[00:01:09.638 --> 00:01:18.800]  So we'll take you to Arizona, where they're literally under siege by the coyotes, the drug runners, and the criminal, treasonous, treacherous federal government.
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.680]  That is coming up as well today.
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.621]  So Ted Nugent, Bob Chapman, and Sheriff Babu joining us from Arizona.
[00:01:27.782 --> 00:01:29.763]  We've got a message to Arizona.
[00:01:29.763 --> 00:01:31.505]  Help is on the way.
[00:01:31.505 --> 00:01:33.526]  Remember Arizona.
[00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:35.447]  Remember Goliad.
[00:01:35.447 --> 00:01:36.448]  Remember the Alamo.
[00:01:36.448 --> 00:01:38.809]  We're going to defend this republic.
[00:01:38.809 --> 00:01:41.511]  It isn't perfect, but it's the best thing we've got.
[00:01:41.511 --> 00:01:43.913]  That's why the globalists want to destroy it.
[00:01:43.913 --> 00:01:45.494]  And the globalists are trying to wreck?
[00:01:45.494 --> 00:01:46.695]  We've got to defend.
[00:01:46.695 --> 00:01:47.615]  They want our guns?
[00:01:47.615 --> 00:01:48.836]  We've got to keep them.
[00:01:48.836 --> 00:01:49.977]  They want to get rid of our borders?
[00:01:49.977 --> 00:01:51.098]  We've got to defend them.
[00:01:51.098 --> 00:01:52.238]  They want to get rid of the dollar?
[00:01:52.238 --> 00:01:52.939]  We've got to save it.
[00:01:53.769 --> 00:01:55.029]  Very, very simple.
[00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:57.150]  They want to erect state income taxes?
[00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.071]  We've got to beat it.
[00:01:59.071 --> 00:02:00.431]  They want to put fluoride in the water?
[00:02:00.431 --> 00:02:01.912]  We've got to get it out of there.
[00:02:01.912 --> 00:02:05.593]  Because every time you research what they want, it's bad for us.
[00:02:05.593 --> 00:02:08.714]  It's bad for humanity.
[00:02:08.714 --> 00:02:11.915]  They want to take baby's blood secretly at birth for DNA databases?
[00:02:11.915 --> 00:02:13.836]  We've got to block it.
[00:02:13.836 --> 00:02:17.577]  Can you believe they've admitted they're doing this now after decades of denial?
[00:02:17.577 --> 00:02:20.818]  Caught red-handed and they just go, well, we still are going to take it at birth and keep it.
[00:02:21.977 --> 00:02:23.598]  And that's just the way it is.
[00:02:23.598 --> 00:02:26.679]  We'll call the CPS on you when your child's born.
[00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:30.660]  I remember when my first child was born, I said, you know, that blood you're taking goes to a DNA database.
[00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.720]  Of course, the nurses all knew it.
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.461]  They said, it doesn't matter.
[00:02:33.461 --> 00:02:34.481]  We've got to test for diseases.
[00:02:34.481 --> 00:02:36.202]  And I said, why don't you test here at the hospital?
[00:02:36.202 --> 00:02:38.503]  It goes to the health department and goes to the Pentagon.
[00:02:38.503 --> 00:02:41.163]  Well, wherever it goes, this is state law.
[00:02:41.163 --> 00:02:42.264]  And I said, no, it's not.
[00:02:42.264 --> 00:02:44.024]  It's state policy.
[00:02:44.024 --> 00:02:45.405]  You're not keeping the blood.
[00:02:51.055 --> 00:03:00.982]  But one time we had a little bit of a sick baby at birth and I wasn't even thinking about it before they slurped the blood out and ran off with it giggling down the hallway.
[00:03:00.982 --> 00:03:04.605]  Literally, I was like, after it happened, I was like, huh?
[00:03:04.605 --> 00:03:07.227]  But that's how all this creeping death
[00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.412]  We're good.
[00:03:24.127 --> 00:03:24.327]  I think?
[00:03:46.308 --> 00:04:11.823]  Belaborate, but I have been offered by heavy hitters three different reality TV shows in the last year and have said no just because I Think it's the offers are basically to spin what we do and make us look foolish So I've said no, even though that would launch us at a new level and I've been approached of course about television in the news format and I always tell these places.
[00:04:11.823 --> 00:04:13.304]  Yeah, you let me go on and say what I want and
[00:04:14.778 --> 00:04:16.318]  And have a free hand, I'll do it.
[00:04:16.318 --> 00:04:18.539]  But not if I have to change who I am.
[00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:20.799]  And of course, the offer is withdrawn.
[00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:27.901]  But that's an indicator of how important this radio show is and how effective it is.
[00:04:27.901 --> 00:04:31.201]  And the fact that it's reaching millions of new people a week.
[00:04:31.201 --> 00:04:33.382]  I mean, look at the Drudge Report today.
[00:04:33.382 --> 00:04:37.023]  LeBron James, he has the headline up there.
[00:04:37.023 --> 00:04:43.084]  Alex Jones says, America collapsing as media worships LeBron James.
[00:04:44.551 --> 00:04:50.435]  And newspapers all over the country, foreign news, is reporting on what we're covering here.
[00:04:50.435 --> 00:04:53.157]  Because it's the truth.
[00:04:53.157 --> 00:04:55.318]  And it's having an effect.
[00:04:55.318 --> 00:04:57.460]  And we're hitting on all cylinders.
[00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.001]  We have reached escape velocity.
[00:05:01.616 --> 00:05:05.599]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:14.446]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:05:14.446 --> 00:05:19.089]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:29.918]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:05:30.538 --> 00:05:40.040]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:45.462]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:05:45.462 --> 00:05:52.963]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:52.963 --> 00:05:55.724]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:05:59.534 --> 00:06:04.078]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:06:04.078 --> 00:06:04.999]  Number 1.
[00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:08.422]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:06:08.422 --> 00:06:09.282]  Number 2.
[00:06:09.282 --> 00:06:14.166]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:06:14.166 --> 00:06:14.927]  It's true.
[00:06:14.927 --> 00:06:19.791]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:06:19.791 --> 00:06:20.612]  Number 3.
[00:06:20.612 --> 00:06:24.215]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:06:24.215 --> 00:06:27.898]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:06:28.098 --> 00:06:28.898]  Number four.
[00:06:28.898 --> 00:06:31.659]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:35.339]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:36.119]  Number five.
[00:06:36.119 --> 00:06:40.280]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:45.321]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:06:45.321 --> 00:06:49.502]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:49.502 --> 00:06:51.282]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:51.282 --> 00:06:55.883]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[00:06:56.303 --> 00:07:03.546]  You may be arrested and or subject to public police action.
[00:07:03.546 --> 00:07:04.806]  Tyranny is here.
[00:07:04.806 --> 00:07:08.547]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:07:08.547 --> 00:07:10.968]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:07:10.968 --> 00:07:16.010]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:23.499]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:07:23.499 --> 00:07:29.488]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:07:29.488 --> 00:07:33.153]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:07:33.653 --> 00:07:37.934]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:07:37.934 --> 00:07:43.895]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:07:43.895 --> 00:07:47.436]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:07:47.436 --> 00:07:49.416]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:07:49.416 --> 00:07:50.537]  It's here.

[00:08:00.526 --> 00:08:05.949]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:05.949 --> 00:08:10.952]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:10.952 --> 00:08:16.236]  My friends, it is Friday, the ninth day of July 2010.
[00:08:16.236 --> 00:08:27.843]  This broadcast is a declaration of independence against tyranny and against the global crime syndicate, the corporate crime syndicate known as the New World Order.
[00:08:29.315 --> 00:08:32.000]  Let me just read to you some of the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 stacks.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.164]  11 stacks of news that I'm going to try to at least...
[00:08:42.253 --> 00:08:43.833]  Scan over all of it.
[00:08:43.833 --> 00:08:46.774]  Detail and mine down into some of it.
[00:08:46.774 --> 00:08:48.715]  There's no way to cover it all.
[00:08:48.715 --> 00:08:51.535]  Ted Nugent coming up in an hour and 22 minutes from now.
[00:08:51.535 --> 00:08:58.157]  Bob Chapman popping in and Sheriff Babu from out in Arizona who's been begging for help and putting out an SOS.
[00:08:58.157 --> 00:08:59.998]  And we got news for you, Sheriff.
[00:08:59.998 --> 00:09:01.718]  Texas is on the way.
[00:09:01.718 --> 00:09:05.279]  So that is coming up as well in the last hour.
[00:09:05.279 --> 00:09:06.699]  This is what's in our stack.
[00:09:06.699 --> 00:09:09.660]  California transit cop verdict sparks looting.
[00:09:11.186 --> 00:09:12.487]  I wouldn't really call this looting.
[00:09:12.487 --> 00:09:15.931]  I'd call it anger and rioting.
[00:09:15.931 --> 00:09:20.656]  And I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen, we've seen what happened with this.
[00:09:20.656 --> 00:09:27.043]  First, the police seized no fewer than five cell phones off of people on the platform.
[00:09:27.043 --> 00:09:33.050]  And then they lied about it there in the Bay Area on the train platform, one of the subway entrances.
[00:09:35.484 --> 00:09:42.347]  And they lied about it and said that he had scuffled and fought and tried to disarm the officers, so the officer in self-defense had done it.
[00:09:42.347 --> 00:09:57.572]  Now, there were a whole passel of cops, there were four police on that platform, more than 50 that showed up after the shooting, and they seemed to wait to get him on a stretcher, close to a half hour, and he died on his way to the hospital.
[00:09:57.572 --> 00:10:01.254]  In fact, he was moving his arms and stuff when they finally got him on the ambulance.
[00:10:01.254 --> 00:10:03.975]  I've watched the footage, we've covered it extensively.
[00:10:05.151 --> 00:10:09.413]  And they killed him, and I guess the word was, look, don't save this guy.
[00:10:09.413 --> 00:10:10.373]  He'll have a bigger lawsuit.
[00:10:10.373 --> 00:10:10.913]  Let him die.
[00:10:10.913 --> 00:10:15.075]  Because they thought they grabbed all the video cameras.
[00:10:15.075 --> 00:10:19.196]  They didn't want to have him talking, saying, look, I was in handcuffs when they shot me in the back.
[00:10:19.196 --> 00:10:21.637]  They said, no, he attacked the officer, tried to disarm him.
[00:10:21.637 --> 00:10:26.419]  This brave hero did what he had to, fighting this evil person.
[00:10:26.419 --> 00:10:26.919]  Remember that?
[00:10:26.919 --> 00:10:29.000]  We heard that the first five or six days.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.142]  And then the footage came out.
[00:10:33.142 --> 00:10:34.242]  Then the footage came out.
[00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:38.882]  Somebody on a train rolling by had stopped.
[00:10:38.882 --> 00:10:44.047]  They hadn't thought to stop that train and go on board and get the cell phone cameras.
[00:10:44.047 --> 00:10:51.774]  And they put him in handcuffs and he wasn't resisting and they were jumping on his head and having a bully party and getting off on it because they were cowards.
[00:10:51.774 --> 00:10:54.677]  A real man wouldn't beat somebody up who was handcuffed.
[00:10:55.555 --> 00:10:57.556]  I mean, that's just basic chivalry.
[00:10:57.556 --> 00:11:01.457]  I can't even get my blood up if some little guy starts a fight with me.
[00:11:01.457 --> 00:11:04.018]  But I go crazy when some giant gets in my face.
[00:11:04.018 --> 00:11:05.559]  I'm just ready to crawl all over him.
[00:11:05.559 --> 00:11:07.039]  I'm ready to pound him into the ground.
[00:11:07.039 --> 00:11:09.160]  I mean, that's what a real man is into.
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.401]  And I'm not claiming I'm the toughest guy in the world, but I'm red-blooded.
[00:11:12.401 --> 00:11:19.184]  Only time I've had my butt whooped is when I fought somebody littler than me.
[00:11:19.184 --> 00:11:24.306]  But no, these guys like to get a guy in handcuffs and jump all over him and put their knees on his head and hop on him.
[00:11:25.407 --> 00:11:30.128]  Then the cop pulled out his gun, chambered around, and shot him right in the back.
[00:11:30.128 --> 00:11:31.669]  Then they even beat him up a little more.
[00:11:31.669 --> 00:11:33.429]  A little more celebration.
[00:11:33.429 --> 00:11:35.650]  I've seen pro-lifers having their arms broken.
[00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:40.451]  It's in the extras of a Marshall Law 9-1-1 Rise of the Police State.
[00:11:40.451 --> 00:11:42.652]  My 2005 film came out five years ago.
[00:11:44.144 --> 00:11:44.284]  I don't
[00:11:59.957 --> 00:12:00.277]  I think so.
[00:12:22.799 --> 00:12:26.340]  With wolves or coyotes, they like to start at the end.
[00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:29.441]  As a cow's front feet will get stuck in, they take their time.
[00:12:29.441 --> 00:12:33.883]  You'll find cows half-eaten still alive, and those wolves and coyotes just love it.
[00:12:33.883 --> 00:12:37.044]  And see, we're the prey now in America with evil police.
[00:12:37.044 --> 00:12:42.466]  Not all police are bad, not all agencies have been turned to evil, but they're slowly twisting them towards the dark side right now.
[00:12:43.306 --> 00:12:45.368]  And it's a predatory thing I've seen.
[00:12:45.368 --> 00:12:50.232]  I've seen multiple tapes of men without legs or men who are paralyzed.
[00:12:50.232 --> 00:12:53.594]  And the cops can see they have shriveled, atrophied legs.
[00:12:53.594 --> 00:12:56.697]  And they come over to them on the sidewalk or at a jail.
[00:12:56.697 --> 00:12:58.338]  You've seen all the cases.
[00:12:58.338 --> 00:12:59.699]  And they tell them, get up and walk.
[00:12:59.699 --> 00:13:01.200]  This has happened now at the TSA.
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.922]  And they say, sir, I'm paralyzed.
[00:13:02.922 --> 00:13:04.363]  And they say, no, you're not.
[00:13:04.363 --> 00:13:05.544]  And then they throw them out.
[00:13:06.593 --> 00:13:20.458]  Of the wheelchair, and of course, these people have been paralyzed for decades, their bones are soft, the muscles all pull off the bone, their legs break, and then the cops just come over, or jail guards come over and just have another little satisfying beating.
[00:13:20.458 --> 00:13:26.101]  There's nothing like beating on a man who can't walk, or a woman who can't walk with a billy club.
[00:13:26.101 --> 00:13:31.263]  For a wolf coward, there's some kind of serious pleasure in that.
[00:13:31.263 --> 00:13:34.404]  Let me tell you something, red-blooded Americans see that and it makes us want to throw up.
[00:13:35.421 --> 00:13:40.927]  It makes us want to puke!
[00:13:40.927 --> 00:13:52.780]  So, one of my listeners posted comments on InfoWars.com with this killer cop, and he's now convicted, this killer cop's
[00:13:54.531 --> 00:13:54.891]  I don't
[00:14:15.731 --> 00:14:24.377]  And of course it was literally a convicted pot head with a bunch of pot who was just an armchair quarterback sitting there at his keyboard feeling powerful.
[00:14:24.377 --> 00:14:27.819]  That's another form of coward we see out there.
[00:14:27.819 --> 00:14:37.586]  And he, see I said I've got 11 stacks of news and I just hit the very first article and I've already spent 8-9 minutes on this.
[00:14:37.586 --> 00:14:44.791]  The point is I've been intimately involved in this case and we've covered it in great detail and the police want to arrest this guy and he's serving a longer sentence.
[00:14:46.257 --> 00:14:49.639]  More than a 10-year sentence for threatening to kill that cop.
[00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:51.120]  And it was wrong to threaten to kill the cop.
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:54.301]  It was wrong to threaten to kill his family, as some other people did.
[00:14:54.301 --> 00:15:02.365]  That is really cowardly and pathetic, and no matter how bad this nutcase, power-tripping, thug cop is, his family doesn't deserve to be threatened.
[00:15:02.365 --> 00:15:03.586]  Keep people's families out of it.
[00:15:03.586 --> 00:15:04.907]  That's another rule of chivalry.
[00:15:05.427 --> 00:15:19.593]  And they came up with these ancient ideas that all cultures have had that have been civilized, whether it was the Japanese samurai or the knights and ladies of old in Europe, because, you know, men who are in battle, you don't want to have your family involved.
[00:15:19.593 --> 00:15:22.274]  So it's like, you don't mess with my family, I don't mess with your family.
[00:15:22.274 --> 00:15:24.415]  Another rule, but idiots don't follow that.
[00:15:25.765 --> 00:15:32.889]  So they kill this poor fellow in cold blood, shoot him in the back, the bullet goes through his back, bounces back up through into his heart.
[00:15:32.889 --> 00:15:38.853]  They blasted him through his lungs, it bounced off the concrete, slapped up through his ribcage into his heart.
[00:15:38.853 --> 00:15:41.955]  And the cops then, on the video, jump on him some more.
[00:15:41.955 --> 00:15:44.997]  The media spins and says, oh look at them helping him.
[00:15:44.997 --> 00:15:48.559]  And then they hang around and take their time until he bleeds out and kill him.
[00:15:50.393 --> 00:15:52.815]  So they could frame him and say he was trying to attack the cops.
[00:15:52.815 --> 00:15:54.236]  Well, sorry.
[00:15:54.236 --> 00:15:56.137]  Two separate videos.
[00:15:56.137 --> 00:16:03.622]  Somebody weighed on the platform about 60 yards away, was smart enough to slip off as the cops started confiscating other people's, and somebody on the train shot it.
[00:16:03.622 --> 00:16:10.087]  Two different unedited videos show the cold-blooded, premeditated, murder one.
[00:16:10.087 --> 00:16:11.868]  Capital premeditated murder.
[00:16:11.868 --> 00:16:12.789]  What do they give this cop?
[00:16:15.455 --> 00:16:17.737]  What, second-degree manslaughter?
[00:16:17.737 --> 00:16:23.201]  He's gonna serve two to four years in jail and it's a state offense, so he'll probably be in six months.
[00:16:23.201 --> 00:16:24.322]  Six months!
[00:16:24.322 --> 00:16:33.750]  All those cops need to go to prison for aiding and abetting that murder by covering up the fact that he was murdered execution-style in handcuffs.
[00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:36.572]  All of them need to be charged as accessories to murder.
[00:16:37.893 --> 00:16:40.861]  Accessories to cold-blooded capital murder.
[00:16:40.861 --> 00:16:43.226]  They need to spend life in prison.
[00:16:43.226 --> 00:16:47.196]  And the cop that did this, he needs to be sent up for death penalty.
[00:16:48.339 --> 00:16:49.159]  Let me tell you something.
[00:16:49.159 --> 00:16:52.220]  He pulled that gun out and he killed him in cold blood.
[00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:53.881]  And I've watched the video carefully.
[00:16:53.881 --> 00:16:55.581]  Some said, well, it was a taser.
[00:16:55.581 --> 00:16:58.162]  He thought it was a taser and it was taser confusion.
[00:16:58.162 --> 00:17:05.304]  And they have had cases where cops in drills have shot their own fellow officers in drills, pulling a gun instead of a taser.
[00:17:05.304 --> 00:17:08.725]  So now in training, they never have a gun on their hip as well as the taser.
[00:17:08.725 --> 00:17:10.405]  It's happened just a couple times.
[00:17:10.405 --> 00:17:12.426]  No, he pulled back.
[00:17:12.426 --> 00:17:12.666]  He, he,
[00:17:13.846 --> 00:17:14.767]  He engaged it.
[00:17:14.767 --> 00:17:16.128]  He knew the difference.
[00:17:16.128 --> 00:17:18.489]  He had a psychopathic pleasure moment.
[00:17:18.489 --> 00:17:23.273]  He was getting off on the adrenaline of jumping on an unarmed, handcuffed man.
[00:17:23.273 --> 00:17:31.659]  He was on a power trip like a mad dog wolf or a great white shark when you got a group of great whites in there in a feeding frenzy eating the carcass of a dead blue whale.
[00:17:31.659 --> 00:17:32.859]  You ever seen that footage?
[00:17:32.859 --> 00:17:39.524]  Of whalers trying to get their blue whales up and a whole pack of great whites come in and they're just rolling and biting each other and killing each other.
[00:17:39.524 --> 00:17:43.167]  You ever watched a group of Makos?
[00:17:45.492 --> 00:17:51.574]  You ever watched a group of Greenland sharks going wild in a feeding frenzy on the carcass of a dead whale?
[00:17:51.574 --> 00:17:53.254]  That's what it looks like.
[00:17:53.254 --> 00:17:55.195]  And that guy's a murderin' animal.
[00:17:55.195 --> 00:17:58.255]  And he needs to go up for life in prison, bare minimum.
[00:17:58.255 --> 00:18:01.876]  Oh, but now the Justice Department's gonna save us.
[00:18:01.876 --> 00:18:09.879]  The Justice Department's gonna come in and do a whitewash investigation as if the feds are our sa- Hey, Justice Department, who's gonna investigate you for murderin' those kids at Waco?
[00:18:09.879 --> 00:18:14.780]  Who's gonna investigate you for being big men, pullin' up in front of that church and opening fire on record first?
[00:18:16.357 --> 00:18:19.321]  You told the Davidians shot back and you ran off like a bunch of cowards.
[00:18:19.321 --> 00:18:22.305]  You're a bunch of cowards.
[00:18:22.305 --> 00:18:24.267]  You're a bunch of cowards.
[00:18:24.267 --> 00:18:26.790]  We need lawmen like Sheriff Mack.
[00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:28.693]  We don't need people like you.
[00:18:28.693 --> 00:18:30.315]  We don't need cowards out there.
[00:18:33.049 --> 00:18:35.050]  Look at our sickening traitorous federal government.
[00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:42.112]  Won't send federal troops, when that's in the Constitution, down to Arizona and South Texas, where law and order is completely collapsing.
[00:18:42.112 --> 00:18:43.892]  Mexican troops are all across the border.
[00:18:43.892 --> 00:18:50.714]  Helicopter raids, gun attacks, police being killed, citizens being kidnapped every day, and it's barely a footnote in the news.
[00:18:50.714 --> 00:18:52.155]  Car bombing attacks.
[00:18:52.155 --> 00:18:54.275]  Whole neighborhoods being burned down.
[00:18:54.275 --> 00:18:58.057]  I've seen a case of 12 homes burned in one night, 14 in one night.
[00:18:58.057 --> 00:18:59.057]  Ranchers being murdered.
[00:19:00.526 --> 00:19:03.208]  And every case I see, the police turn and run.
[00:19:03.208 --> 00:19:07.972]  Every case I've seen, Mexican troops come many miles over the border now and rob police at gunpoint.
[00:19:07.972 --> 00:19:10.935]  I wouldn't care if it was five Humvees against my one car.
[00:19:10.935 --> 00:19:16.660]  I'll guarantee you, I'd jump behind that car, pull out my semi-automatic rifle if I was a cop, and I'd go to war with those people!
[00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:18.702]  I don't understand this compulsion to run!
[00:19:18.702 --> 00:19:20.323]  Where's your compulsion to fight?
[00:19:20.323 --> 00:19:21.344]  What's wrong with people?
[00:19:21.604 --> 00:19:23.586]  Well, I'll tell you, it's what's in the water.
[00:19:23.586 --> 00:19:33.914]  And it's on record, just like Fox News reported last week, Maryland's now banned that bisphenol A. There's a bunch of other sub-chemicals that are known to sterilize and reduce men's testosterone.
[00:19:33.914 --> 00:19:37.417]  We've been brain-damaged, we've been sterilized, we've been... That's why.
[00:19:37.417 --> 00:19:42.741]  That's why the most red-blooded, fightin' people in the world history have been turned into a bunch of gelded cowards.
[00:19:42.741 --> 00:19:49.207]  Americans, our ancestors whooped the British, arming the empire that had never been defeated, fightin' them 10 to 1 conservatively.
[00:19:49.667 --> 00:19:51.110]  Yeah, what have we turned into?
[00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:53.256]  People that run from Mexican drug gangs!
[00:19:53.256 --> 00:19:54.278]  Cowards!
[00:19:54.278 --> 00:19:56.864]  The ancestors of the... This makes me sick!
[00:20:00.393 --> 00:20:02.915]  You worry, but only because you're paying attention.
[00:20:02.915 --> 00:20:06.477]  What's happening in the Gulf of Mexico illustrates an audacity toward nature.
[00:20:06.477 --> 00:20:14.962]  A similar audacity called GMO, or genetically modified organisms, means that the quality of commercially grown food may be compromised with our health in the balance.
[00:20:14.962 --> 00:20:19.845]  Now that summer's here, what better time to learn about the bounty that nature provides in wild edible food.
[00:20:20.445 --> 00:20:26.070]  Let author Linda Runyon show you the best-kept secret in plain sight that food is everywhere you look.
[00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:34.118]  This summer, for the cost of a good meal or two out, you can literally starvation-proof yourself and your loved ones against any future craziness and put up tons of free food, too.
[00:20:34.118 --> 00:20:39.103]  Whatever experiment is being run on us, you can rest assured that Linda's 50 or so staple foods aren't involved.
[00:20:39.563 --> 00:20:41.385]  Our foods are their enemy.
[00:20:41.385 --> 00:20:47.231]  So go to ofthefield.com or call toll-free 1-888-51-EAT-FREE and take that first step.
[00:20:47.231 --> 00:20:50.214]  Make your oasis of food security and nutrition now.
[00:20:50.214 --> 00:20:53.498]  That's O-F-T-H-E-F-I-E-L-D dot com or call 1-888-513-2837.
[00:20:53.498 --> 00:20:54.879]  Start now and make 2010 your year of independence.
[00:21:02.332 --> 00:21:08.094]  The economy is crumbling, debt soaring, and the possibility of World War III is increasing.
[00:21:08.094 --> 00:21:20.179]  I started SurvivalistSeeds.com from my dining room table with a small bucket of seed and a single rotating banner ad on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:21:20.179 --> 00:21:28.442]  Two years later, we've sold over 40,000 pounds of heirloom seeds, becoming the largest bulk seed seller to the public.
[00:21:28.442 --> 00:21:32.124]  The majority of our customers are Alex Jones listeners.
[00:21:33.004 --> 00:21:49.177]  Now I'm offering 50 all organic garden varieties, 10,000 heirloom seeds, garden planter, and a CD teaching you how to save seeds so your children's children will always have healthy food.
[00:21:49.177 --> 00:21:51.899]  Don't wait until it's too late.
[00:21:51.899 --> 00:21:57.344]  I'm Vic John Lipscomb and my company is survivalistseeds.com.
[00:22:00.182 --> 00:22:01.243]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:22:01.243 --> 00:22:06.185]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:22:06.185 --> 00:22:14.270]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:19.613]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:22:19.833 --> 00:22:27.119]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:22:27.119 --> 00:22:32.724]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[00:22:32.724 --> 00:22:37.788]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[00:22:37.788 --> 00:22:45.734]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[00:22:45.734 --> 00:22:48.417]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt,
[00:22:48.857 --> 00:22:52.279]  Gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:22:52.279 --> 00:22:56.142]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:56.142 --> 00:22:57.022]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:57.022 --> 00:23:08.130]  For years, you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained the leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.
[00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:11.692]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?

[00:23:54.853 --> 00:23:58.216]  HerbalHealer.com, working with the power of nature.
[00:24:15.759 --> 00:24:20.882]  What does that say about this Bay Area transit cop and his cohorts?
[00:24:20.882 --> 00:24:27.906]  That they kill a guy in cold blood, murder him execution style, and then cover it up.
[00:24:27.906 --> 00:24:31.788]  And I've watched the tapes, I've read the reports, they waited and let that guy die.
[00:24:32.844 --> 00:24:38.932]  But if they go see a movie like Hurt Locker where they shoot terrorists and let them bleed to death, it's kind of like, oh, we watched Hurt Locker.
[00:24:38.932 --> 00:24:40.534]  You know, he's a terrorist.
[00:24:40.534 --> 00:24:41.995]  Let him die.
[00:24:41.995 --> 00:24:49.445]  Or in Heartbreak Ridge, Sonny Highway, you know, after he's wounded troops, he executes them in the field.
[00:24:49.445 --> 00:24:51.267]  That's what patriots do.
[00:24:51.267 --> 00:24:51.828]  No, it's not.
[00:24:53.257 --> 00:24:53.937]  No, it's not.
[00:24:53.937 --> 00:24:56.478]  Not unless that's what you want to happen to you.
[00:24:56.478 --> 00:24:58.879]  There's a reason we have the Geneva Convention.
[00:24:58.879 --> 00:25:01.040]  There's a reason we have common sense.
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:02.640]  There's a reason we don't torture.
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:04.541]  There's a reason we have due process.
[00:25:04.541 --> 00:25:06.321]  There's a reason we have a Bill of Rights.
[00:25:06.321 --> 00:25:08.182]  There's a reason we have private property.
[00:25:08.182 --> 00:25:11.863]  Because if we don't have these protections, we got nothing.
[00:25:11.863 --> 00:25:15.965]  Every time in history, we will be overtaken by scum.
[00:25:15.965 --> 00:25:19.466]  By criminal groups that combine forces together to loot us.
[00:25:20.981 --> 00:25:22.541]  There's no such thing as anarchy.
[00:25:22.541 --> 00:25:27.103]  There's always groups of criminals that get together to rob others.
[00:25:27.103 --> 00:25:37.505]  So patriots have to get together and agree upon a Bill of Rights and a Constitution and a tiny limited government as a defense system against the invaders.
[00:25:37.505 --> 00:25:40.946]  The corporate takeover artists are our main enemy today.
[00:25:40.946 --> 00:25:47.368]  America is falling to a foreign corporate takeover right now.
[00:25:47.368 --> 00:25:50.029]  California transit cop verdict sparks looting.
[00:25:51.232 --> 00:25:53.374]  A white former transit police officer.
[00:25:53.374 --> 00:25:56.496]  Oh, there were black officers that helped with the cover-up, because it's a gang.
[00:25:56.496 --> 00:25:57.737]  It ain't about color.
[00:25:57.737 --> 00:26:01.340]  They shoot white guys in the back all the time, too.
[00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:15.372]  A white former transit police officer was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in a videotaped shooting death of an unarmed black man last year in Oakland, California, sparking a wave of looting and destruction in the city on Thursday evening.
[00:26:17.947 --> 00:26:29.283]  The verdict prompted a peaceful protest by a thousand people in downtown Oakland, which gave way after nightfall to some people looting stores, smashing car windows, throwing powerful fireworks at police, and lighting fires in trash cans.
[00:26:30.322 --> 00:26:35.184]  The police numbering in the hundreds made 50 arrests, but Oakland police expected the figure could double.
[00:26:35.184 --> 00:26:39.967]  This is not the Wild Wild West, Oakland Police Chief Anthony Bates told televised news conference.
[00:26:39.967 --> 00:26:42.348]  This city will not tolerate this activity.
[00:26:42.348 --> 00:26:48.531]  Oh, but you'll tolerate a psycho cop killing somebody in plain view and shooting them in the back when they're in handcuffs?
[00:26:48.531 --> 00:26:55.414]  And then you'll let the other officers lie and sign fake police reports that he was resisting and wasn't in handcuffs?
[00:26:56.656 --> 00:26:59.478]  And the first report was he tried to get the gun?
[00:26:59.478 --> 00:27:01.199]  You guys were all sitting on him.
[00:27:01.199 --> 00:27:04.262]  Part of your ego trip.
[00:27:04.262 --> 00:27:05.623]  You were all squatting on him.
[00:27:05.623 --> 00:27:07.124]  You were all jumping on his head.
[00:27:07.124 --> 00:27:09.265]  You know full well you're a pack of liars.
[00:27:09.265 --> 00:27:11.247]  You're accessories to murder.
[00:27:11.247 --> 00:27:13.348]  Don't worry, you got away with it though.
[00:27:13.348 --> 00:27:16.230]  Just like the foreign banks got away with destroying the country.
[00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:17.992]  And I got news for you.
[00:27:17.992 --> 00:27:23.316]  Many of the California pension funds for police have already been pledged to the bankers, so you'll be losing that directly as well.
[00:27:24.056 --> 00:27:26.598]  So don't worry, they're gonna get away with hurting you too.
[00:27:26.598 --> 00:27:29.280]  You think you're the only one that gets away with being lawless?
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:32.263]  Oh no, that's not how this works.
[00:27:32.263 --> 00:27:38.708]  That's not how the universe works, buddy boy.
[00:27:38.708 --> 00:27:39.949]  I hate the lawlessness.
[00:27:39.949 --> 00:27:42.911]  I hate that they have disgraced the uniform like this.
[00:27:42.911 --> 00:27:46.474]  And they got me happy to be able to report something like this.
[00:27:46.474 --> 00:27:50.498]  This will just make the cops become more criminal, more thuggish, more sticking to themselves.
[00:27:50.498 --> 00:27:51.899]  It's all part of the globalist plan.
[00:27:54.016 --> 00:27:56.077]  I wish the cops would have sent this guy down the river.
[00:27:56.077 --> 00:27:58.398]  I wish the police would have told the truth that day.
[00:27:58.398 --> 00:28:02.400]  I wish this cop would have been in handcuffs within 30 minutes of this happening, as soon as they found him.
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:03.401]  But no.
[00:28:03.401 --> 00:28:06.342]  No, instead, all over the country, it's almost always an old man.
[00:28:06.342 --> 00:28:09.324]  For some reason, that makes the wolves in uniform go crazy.
[00:28:09.324 --> 00:28:11.225]  It's cops that are making these decisions.
[00:28:11.225 --> 00:28:15.707]  Where some 82, 84, 92, I've interviewed some of them.
[00:28:15.707 --> 00:28:19.009]  There was one yesterday we talked about in Colorado.
[00:28:19.009 --> 00:28:22.510]  People come on his farm, are robbing his vehicle, try to run over him.
[00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:23.191]  He shoots one.
[00:28:23.922 --> 00:28:34.769]  The people admit they're stealing the thing, they're illegal aliens, and they release them and indict him for murder.
[00:28:34.769 --> 00:28:37.551]  He's facing a murder charge.
[00:28:37.551 --> 00:28:40.633]  Murder charge, not manslaughter.
[00:28:40.633 --> 00:28:46.637]  But this guy, he gets a sub-degree of manslaughter.
[00:28:50.259 --> 00:28:52.422]  Involuntary manslaughter.
[00:28:52.422 --> 00:28:54.065]  Not even manslaughter.
[00:28:54.065 --> 00:29:00.414]  Like, you get in a fight with somebody, you start the fight, but you punch them in the temple and they bleed out in their brain and die.
[00:29:00.414 --> 00:29:01.936]  That would be involuntary manslaughter.
[00:29:06.391 --> 00:29:11.474]  Well, if you started it, it would be manslaughter, which means it's an accident still, but it's your fault.
[00:29:11.474 --> 00:29:12.874]  This is involuntary.
[00:29:12.874 --> 00:29:21.099]  Kind of like if you accidentally backed out of your yard, but were doing it too fast, you had some culpability, that'd be involuntary manslaughter, and you run over somebody.
[00:29:21.099 --> 00:29:29.603]  Jurors can render an involuntary manslaughter conviction if they believe the defendant lacked an intent to kill, but engaged in conduct so grossly negligent that it amounts to a crime.
[00:29:30.745 --> 00:29:40.050]  This guy cold-bloodedly, without a shadow of a doubt, murdered that guy and then the police covered it up and tried to frame the guy they killed.
[00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:41.830]  Now what does that tell you?
[00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:47.913]  Some guy that wanted to go out and see a fireworks display and you murdered him in cold blood and you've gotten away with it.
[00:29:47.913 --> 00:29:48.794]  You got away with it.
[00:29:48.794 --> 00:29:50.455]  Great job!
[00:29:50.455 --> 00:29:51.855]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.855 --> 00:29:54.377]  The Empire's on the run.

[00:30:00.608 --> 00:30:01.548]  This is important.

[00:33:10.646 --> 00:33:18.709]  Ted Nugent's one hour out, precisely.
[00:33:18.709 --> 00:33:20.149]  Is precisely one hour out.
[00:33:20.149 --> 00:33:28.632]  And we're here live, Monday through Friday, from 11 a.m.
[00:33:28.632 --> 00:33:29.272]  to 3 p.m.
[00:33:29.272 --> 00:33:34.113]  Central Standard Time, back Mondays.
[00:33:34.113 --> 00:33:38.555]  On Monday, we'll be going to three hours, but we're gonna re-air the first hour and the fourth hour for stations that are carrying it.
[00:33:39.915 --> 00:33:44.276]  And of course we have the Sunday broadcast 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:33:44.276 --> 00:33:48.077]  Central Standard Time as well and I will be live this Sunday.
[00:33:48.077 --> 00:34:00.619]  I was off for the 4th of July with a great rebroadcast with Jesse Ventura, Ron Paul, and of course Judge Andrew Napolitano.
[00:34:00.619 --> 00:34:09.541]  Speaking of Andrew Napolitano, he had record ratings again for the Fox Business Channel over the weekend.
[00:34:11.308 --> 00:34:19.576]  Top show out of the gates, just like Ventura's got the top show out of the gates on TruTV, because people want to hear about the New World Order.
[00:34:19.576 --> 00:34:21.378]  They want to hear about globalism.
[00:34:21.378 --> 00:34:30.367]  They are anti-New World Order.
[00:34:30.367 --> 00:34:35.552]  And it illustrates how far we've come, how this information is becoming more and more mainstream.
[00:34:36.601 --> 00:34:48.007]  That A, somebody like Napolitano is given a show on Fox, and that B, it's top rated.
[00:34:48.007 --> 00:34:57.973]  But you look at the Drudge Report today, every week linking to Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com articles now.
[00:34:57.973 --> 00:35:03.136]  And today, linking to a YouTube video, almost as an afterthought, that I shot.
[00:35:05.506 --> 00:35:06.561]  And then Aaron put together.
[00:35:07.751 --> 00:35:11.033]  And I'll talk about that coming up in a few minutes, dealing with LeBron James.
[00:35:11.033 --> 00:35:17.297]  But the fact that the Drudge Report links to Herman Van Rompuy calling for world government, the head of the EU.
[00:35:17.297 --> 00:35:22.661]  The fact that he does link to the Financial Times of London when they announce how great world government is and how it's taking over.
[00:35:22.661 --> 00:35:36.130]  The fact that the icon of alternative media, kind of the bridge between alternative and mainstream media, Drudge, in the last year and a half, has really been posting the truth and has been exposing the New World Order.
[00:35:37.435 --> 00:35:40.477]  And I was pointing that out before he started linking to us all the time.
[00:35:40.477 --> 00:35:43.739]  It just shows his transformation.
[00:35:43.739 --> 00:35:48.262]  And it's pretty hardcore video he posted that I cut.
[00:35:48.262 --> 00:36:01.830]  I mean, I talk about the new world order, the global government taking over our country, the globalists, how they're overthrowing the banks, the domestic banks, how these foreign banks are taking over, how they're getting rid of the dollar, how it's all engineered.
[00:36:06.721 --> 00:36:09.282]  This is incredible.
[00:36:09.282 --> 00:36:15.405]  The Drudge Report receives tens of millions of visitors per day.
[00:36:15.405 --> 00:36:17.426]  And many of those visitors are media.
[00:36:17.426 --> 00:36:22.549]  I've been in mainstream television studios, radio studios, newspapers.
[00:36:22.549 --> 00:36:25.971]  I've seen countless photos of news reporters in their newsrooms.
[00:36:25.971 --> 00:36:30.213]  And if you look in the background, you'll see computer screens with the Drudge Report on it.
[00:36:30.213 --> 00:36:34.275]  This is where so much of the mainstream media goes to see what the agenda is.
[00:36:35.259 --> 00:36:47.453]  In the past, they said that the establishment set its agenda through the New York Times and, to a lesser extent, the Washington Post.
[00:36:48.928 --> 00:36:54.333]  And that the right wing of America, its agenda was stated via the Washington Times.
[00:36:54.333 --> 00:37:06.543]  Well, people are leaving the Washington Post, New York Times, and Washington Times in droves from the control left-right paradigm, and they're going to Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:37:06.543 --> 00:37:09.125]  And they're going to the Drudge Report.
[00:37:09.125 --> 00:37:15.150]  And it shows that the mainstream media no longer is able to set the agenda, and the alternative media is setting the agenda.
[00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:17.692]  And so in the past, the mainstream media could ignore a story.
[00:37:18.766 --> 00:37:36.782]  But because Infowars.com and PrisonPilot.com leading the way, and the Drudge Report was the first big outfit in the U.S., within one day of us covering it, to put the fact of ClimateGate on the radar, and the mainstream media for another two plus weeks would not report on any of it.
[00:37:36.782 --> 00:37:41.426]  There was a total blockade, a news blackout.
[00:37:41.426 --> 00:37:43.048]  But that news blackout imploded.
[00:37:47.401 --> 00:37:48.462]  It failed.
[00:37:48.462 --> 00:37:50.223]  Their shields failed.
[00:37:50.223 --> 00:37:53.224]  And now it's a complete rout of the mainstream media.
[00:37:53.224 --> 00:37:55.466]  And the mainstream media now admits this.
[00:37:55.466 --> 00:37:56.807]  They are in free fall.
[00:37:56.807 --> 00:37:59.128]  They are burning themselves down.
[00:37:59.128 --> 00:38:07.553]  At any time they can start telling the truth and survive and remain in place and be part of the game.
[00:38:07.553 --> 00:38:11.275]  But no.
[00:38:11.275 --> 00:38:13.336]  They don't want to stay relevant because they can't.
[00:38:13.336 --> 00:38:14.617]  Because their minor
[00:38:17.876 --> 00:38:24.578]  Subsidiaries of the military industrial complex and private banking complex that owns them.
[00:38:24.578 --> 00:38:30.100]  That owns them like little pieces of change in their pockets.
[00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:38.262]  The hundred million, two hundred and three hundred million dollar budgets of different TV networks are nothing.
[00:38:38.262 --> 00:38:41.743]  Nothing compared to just one cruise missile shipment.
[00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:52.506]  One cruise missile purchase, or the purchase of three or four stealth bombers.
[00:38:52.506 --> 00:38:57.110]  Nothing compared to what the Afghan war cost today, or the Iraq war cost today.
[00:38:57.110 --> 00:38:59.632]  Nothing compared to Halliburton and no-bid contracts.
[00:38:59.632 --> 00:39:01.093]  In one case, what, $16 million?
[00:39:01.093 --> 00:39:10.480]  We're right at $16 million for a $100 blue tarp?
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:11.761]  $5,000 hammers and toilet seats?
[00:39:11.761 --> 00:39:13.042]  It's all a big rip-off scam.
[00:39:16.621 --> 00:39:19.162]  And so, they're losing all credibility.
[00:39:19.162 --> 00:39:30.604]  They had their arrogance, their chutzpah, whatever you wanted to call it, their bravado, and now that's all imploded, and they're going, my gosh, we're dead, nobody believes us anymore, and so they're sicking the feds on us to start shutting down the web.
[00:39:30.604 --> 00:39:39.507]  And now, that's out in the open, so that's even waking people up faster that the alternative media was right.
[00:39:39.507 --> 00:39:40.447]  And I say in the video,
[00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:46.003]  I say it's now time for media and government and the public and everybody to choose a side.
[00:39:46.003 --> 00:39:47.845]  Are you with the New World Order?
[00:39:47.845 --> 00:39:49.045]  And with all their distractions?
[00:39:49.045 --> 00:39:50.787]  Or are you going to stand up and defeat the globalists?
[00:39:50.787 --> 00:39:56.030]  And the Drudge Report linked it as one of its top stories.
[00:39:56.030 --> 00:40:00.013]  A hardcore Alex Jones video on the Drudge Report.
[00:40:00.013 --> 00:40:00.994]  What does that tell you?
[00:40:02.904 --> 00:40:15.594]  It tells you that there are a lot of people in the media who are not New World Order, who are not sellouts, who understand that America is being destroyed and they need to come out and tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
[00:40:15.594 --> 00:40:19.577]  People are taking my challenge and they're taking action with it.
[00:40:19.577 --> 00:40:25.061]  And if we simply stand up and point out the Emperor has no clothes, this New World Order is going to implode.
[00:40:25.061 --> 00:40:25.462]  Period.
[00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:42.025]  But it's gonna take courage by sheriffs, and police, and mayors, and business leaders, and school teachers, and pastors, and auto mechanics, and bass fishing guides, and artists.
[00:40:42.025 --> 00:40:45.829]  It doesn't matter who you are, you've got inherent power!
[00:40:47.324 --> 00:40:48.885]  And the world government is real.
[00:40:48.885 --> 00:40:49.586]  It's unelected.
[00:40:49.586 --> 00:40:50.586]  It's authoritarian.
[00:40:50.586 --> 00:40:51.987]  It's dehumanizing.
[00:40:51.987 --> 00:41:00.152]  We've got an absolute imperative responsibility, not a right, but a duty as the Declaration of Independent States.
[00:41:00.152 --> 00:41:03.635]  It's a right and a duty to stand up and speak out against this.
[00:41:03.635 --> 00:41:06.336]  We know what bonafide tyranny is.
[00:41:06.336 --> 00:41:09.539]  We know hardcore corruption when we see it.
[00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:16.106]  It was like two weeks ago, I walk out in the backyard, there's the biggest skunk I've ever seen.
[00:41:16.106 --> 00:41:21.972]  Lights from the back porch were going out about 20 yards to the edge of the fence.
[00:41:21.972 --> 00:41:24.014]  And it was the biggest skunk I'd ever seen.
[00:41:24.014 --> 00:41:27.277]  It probably weighed 40 pounds.
[00:41:29.417 --> 00:41:38.804]  You could see the stripes on its backs were probably four or five inches apart at the widest point, and my French Bulldog ran out and saw it, and I said, no!
[00:41:38.804 --> 00:41:43.907]  And he still ran after it, and thank God the skunk just got back through the fence and didn't spray him.
[00:41:43.907 --> 00:41:45.869]  But I knew what a skunk looked like.
[00:41:45.869 --> 00:41:54.435]  The minute I opened the back door to go out and walk the dog, and I see this gigantic skunk alerting with its tail up, but luckily its head facing us,
[00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:59.921]  I was just dumbfounded by the biggest skunk I'd ever seen, and I knew what it was.
[00:41:59.921 --> 00:42:06.823]  A big, black animal with two white stripes down its back.
[00:42:06.823 --> 00:42:08.744]  You know, animals in nature let you know what they are.
[00:42:08.744 --> 00:42:10.745]  It's like a rattlesnake's got a rattle.
[00:42:10.745 --> 00:42:13.325]  It's not looking for trouble, folks, like a water moccasin.
[00:42:13.325 --> 00:42:15.006]  They're actually aggressive snakes.
[00:42:15.006 --> 00:42:16.567]  Rattlesnakes are not generally aggressive.
[00:42:16.567 --> 00:42:18.147]  In fact, they want to be left alone.
[00:42:18.147 --> 00:42:22.909]  That's why the first symbol of this country, it was almost the national flag, was the rattlesnake.
[00:42:22.909 --> 00:42:24.149]  That's what Benjamin Franklin wanted.
[00:42:25.768 --> 00:42:26.969]  And it says, don't tread on me.
[00:42:26.969 --> 00:42:30.791]  Look, I'm not looking for trouble, but I got teeth, pal.
[00:42:30.791 --> 00:42:31.731]  It's the same thing.
[00:42:31.731 --> 00:42:35.473]  We know what tyranny looks like.
[00:42:35.473 --> 00:42:37.775]  I mean, I walk out my back door, there's a gigantic skunk.
[00:42:37.775 --> 00:42:43.678]  I know what a skunk looks like.
[00:42:43.678 --> 00:42:45.099]  We know what's happening.
[00:42:48.530 --> 00:42:50.812]  Okay, here's some of the other news coming up.
[00:42:50.812 --> 00:42:57.457]  Huge financial information, more on the amazing verdict out in California.
[00:42:57.457 --> 00:43:09.928]  They're now going to move ahead with shops at the malls and at the grocery stores where you've got a face scan, thumbprint, voice print.
[00:43:12.557 --> 00:43:16.879]  Breathalyzer test to be able to get beer or wine, and this is going to be for all products soon.
[00:43:16.879 --> 00:43:19.301]  It's going to be a cashless federal sales tax.
[00:43:19.301 --> 00:43:22.622]  They're starting that with the tanning salons and other special taxes.
[00:43:22.622 --> 00:43:23.663]  They're just setting the precedent.
[00:43:23.663 --> 00:43:26.625]  This has all been diagrammed out as public.
[00:43:26.625 --> 00:43:28.466]  So I've got that news report.
[00:43:28.466 --> 00:43:30.086]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:43:30.086 --> 00:43:32.508]  Mark of the Beast rears its head in Pennsylvania.
[00:43:33.248 --> 00:43:35.330]  Vintage idea, a wine vending machine.
[00:43:35.330 --> 00:43:40.174]  All you have to do is swipe your driver's license, look into the CCTV camera, and blow into the breathalyzer.
[00:43:40.174 --> 00:43:41.735]  And of course, this is inside the stores.
[00:43:41.735 --> 00:43:43.676]  This is inside the grocery stores.
[00:43:43.676 --> 00:43:46.158]  It's going to all go cashless.
[00:43:46.158 --> 00:43:47.219]  I've got that here.
[00:43:47.219 --> 00:43:50.822]  I've got Belgians plan to wash its dead down the drain.
[00:43:50.822 --> 00:43:54.985]  Bodies must be melted in acid because a body puts off CO2 when it rots.
[00:43:54.985 --> 00:43:56.947]  So you can't bury your dead now.
[00:43:56.947 --> 00:43:59.088]  You've got to dispose of the dead the way the government says.
[00:43:59.969 --> 00:44:04.493]  It's always been an ancient right that people are allowed to dispose of their dead the way their religion sees fit.
[00:44:04.493 --> 00:44:09.437]  But no, you will melt the body because it won't put off the deadly carbon dioxide.
[00:44:09.437 --> 00:44:12.139]  See, they make you do ridiculous things to set the precedent.
[00:44:12.139 --> 00:44:13.520]  They control you.
[00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:17.683]  Half of Americans oppose Obama's immigration plan, a lawsuit says.
[00:44:17.683 --> 00:44:22.187]  It's more like 80% in the polls I've seen.
[00:44:22.187 --> 00:44:23.448]  A bunch of war news.
[00:44:23.448 --> 00:44:25.189]  They've done a big spy swap.
[00:44:25.189 --> 00:44:27.491]  So much for those of you out there that said that
[00:44:31.348 --> 00:44:33.609]  Said that this wasn't Russian spies.
[00:44:33.609 --> 00:44:35.710]  They just had a spy swap.
[00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:38.611]  Of course they were spies.
[00:44:38.611 --> 00:44:39.451]  Of course they were.
[00:44:39.451 --> 00:44:41.091]  They had fake names.
[00:44:41.091 --> 00:44:42.852]  They were here illegally.
[00:44:42.852 --> 00:44:45.673]  They were sleeper cells.
[00:44:45.673 --> 00:44:49.014]  They weren't a special forces sleeper cell.
[00:44:49.014 --> 00:44:52.375]  That's the ones you gotta worry about.
[00:44:52.375 --> 00:44:54.216]  A sabotage squad.
[00:44:54.216 --> 00:44:55.096]  No, their M.O.
[00:44:55.096 --> 00:44:57.837]  fits a sex op.
[00:44:57.837 --> 00:44:59.278]  And business infiltration op.
[00:44:59.278 --> 00:45:00.278]  IT infiltration op.
[00:45:02.185 --> 00:45:04.206]  Of course, they did a swap with U.S.
[00:45:04.206 --> 00:45:06.408]  spies that have been held in Russia.
[00:45:06.408 --> 00:45:08.890]  All these countries have spies.
[00:45:08.890 --> 00:45:15.034]  But you notice they infiltrated banks and Wall Street and Harvard because that's the shadow government.
[00:45:15.034 --> 00:45:16.415]  That's who's hijacked our country.
[00:45:16.415 --> 00:45:17.535]  It's a corporate takeover.
[00:45:17.535 --> 00:45:20.878]  So the Russians have to infiltrate Wall Street.
[00:45:20.878 --> 00:45:23.419]  Of course they do.
[00:45:23.419 --> 00:45:26.661]  The Congress is a... They're not pedophiles.
[00:45:26.661 --> 00:45:27.922]  They're on the take, most of them.
[00:45:27.922 --> 00:45:30.644]  And so, you know, they're vestigial.
[00:45:30.644 --> 00:45:31.705]  They're ceremonial.
[00:45:32.725 --> 00:45:34.886]  But not if we can change it, not if we have something to do with it.
[00:45:34.886 --> 00:45:38.808]  We're gonna get this country back at the state level and then federal.
[00:45:38.808 --> 00:45:50.993]  So that's coming up and when I start the second segment of the Eight After, I'm gonna get into LeBron James because this story illustrates everything.
[00:45:50.993 --> 00:45:52.833]  Everything.
[00:45:52.833 --> 00:46:01.057]  And I didn't really in the video, the six minute video that's gone mega viral on the web, I didn't really even make the main point
[00:46:02.486 --> 00:46:03.487]  It was kind of an afterthought.
[00:46:03.487 --> 00:46:06.110]  I shot as I walked out of here at about six.
[00:46:06.110 --> 00:46:12.255]  Aaron had it up at about eight, well before they made the announcement that he was going to Miami.
[00:46:12.255 --> 00:46:15.158]  I mean, I knew he was going to Miami.
[00:46:15.158 --> 00:46:18.281]  They don't have a sales tax there.
[00:46:18.281 --> 00:46:20.884]  I mean, they don't have a federal state income tax there.
[00:46:24.642 --> 00:46:26.883]  And it's a lot more money.
[00:46:26.883 --> 00:46:27.984]  And I knew he was going to leave.
[00:46:27.984 --> 00:46:31.285]  I mean, he wouldn't show up until the team panicked and said, you better get down there.
[00:46:31.285 --> 00:46:34.607]  There's 4,000 fans at the convention center wanting to worship you.
[00:46:34.607 --> 00:46:38.989]  And he showed up for 10 minutes and was noncommittal.
[00:46:38.989 --> 00:46:45.593]  I mean, you think because you sung to him and you groveled to him and that's your identity in your state?
[00:46:47.830 --> 00:46:53.394]  In Ohio, your identity is some guy that can put a ball in a basket?
[00:46:53.394 --> 00:47:02.940]  When Ohio is one of the states on the verge of going bankrupt?
[00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:05.741]  And your governor serenaded him?
[00:47:05.741 --> 00:47:09.003]  And you pathetically sit there and beg him?
[00:47:09.003 --> 00:47:12.686]  You beg and beg and beg and beg?
[00:47:12.686 --> 00:47:14.727]  You just got pimped!
[00:47:14.727 --> 00:47:15.888]  Well, I mean, what do you expect?
[00:47:17.005 --> 00:47:19.946]  That's what this country's about.
[00:47:19.946 --> 00:47:21.447]  Quite frankly, I don't blame the guy.
[00:47:21.447 --> 00:47:24.588]  It's a vapid, shallow thing.
[00:47:24.588 --> 00:47:26.509]  If your child's playing basketball, that's great.
[00:47:26.509 --> 00:47:29.770]  It's good for them, good for their self-confidence, good for their heart, their lungs.
[00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:38.654]  But going and worshipping a bunch of arrogant people making $10 million a year and having that be your child's role model, that's why America's so screwed up.
[00:47:48.732 --> 00:47:50.152]  People care about Lindsay Lohan.
[00:47:50.152 --> 00:47:51.533]  They know all about Lindsay Lohan.
[00:47:51.533 --> 00:47:55.694]  Some crackhead blonde hag.
[00:47:55.694 --> 00:48:00.295]  Some burnout skank.
[00:48:00.295 --> 00:48:02.876]  A joke.
[00:48:02.876 --> 00:48:06.257]  A mental patient.
[00:48:06.257 --> 00:48:08.518]  And that's what our young people are taught to care about.
[00:48:08.518 --> 00:48:09.558]  It's all scientific.
[00:48:09.558 --> 00:48:14.079]  I've got all the government documents from the 30s, 40s, 50s.
[00:48:14.079 --> 00:48:15.900]  All the top psych warfare experts.
[00:48:17.293 --> 00:48:20.735]  Edward Bernays and others, all bragging how they ruined you.
[00:48:20.735 --> 00:48:30.319]  I've got stuff from the 20s about how they were gonna, you can go read it for yourselves, wrote the book Propaganda, how they were gonna not have inventors and scientists and trailblazers and Davy Crockett as heroes.
[00:48:30.319 --> 00:48:31.799]  They don't want that.
[00:48:31.799 --> 00:48:35.061]  No, they were gonna have basketball and football.
[00:48:35.061 --> 00:48:39.342]  At the time they talked about baseball being a mindless diversion.
[00:48:39.342 --> 00:48:40.363]  And they gotcha!
[00:48:40.363 --> 00:48:42.424]  You know all about
[00:48:43.370 --> 00:48:45.732]  You know, our kids sing ballads.
[00:48:45.732 --> 00:48:47.213]  You know, the ballad of Nolan Ryan.
[00:48:47.213 --> 00:48:49.854]  And by the way, Nolan Ryan is a fan of the show.
[00:48:49.854 --> 00:48:50.955]  I've talked to him and his son.
[00:48:50.955 --> 00:48:51.635]  He's a good guy.
[00:48:51.635 --> 00:48:54.657]  And he knows baseball isn't what's important at the end of the day.
[00:48:54.657 --> 00:48:56.999]  He understands it's fighting the new world order.
[00:48:56.999 --> 00:48:58.480]  We ought to get Nolan Ryan on.
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:01.982]  They offered to come on one time when I ran into him, but I just never followed it up.
[00:49:01.982 --> 00:49:04.544]  That shows how I don't really work on those things.
[00:49:04.544 --> 00:49:08.026]  In fact, Jaron, Nolan Ryan, and I know his son will come on.
[00:49:08.026 --> 00:49:08.887]  His son's a big fan.
[00:49:14.864 --> 00:49:22.512]  Yeah, I called in one time when Nolan Ryan's son was on the radio, and he said, oh, me and my dad are big fans.
[00:49:22.512 --> 00:49:23.533]  Said that on KVAD.
[00:49:23.533 --> 00:49:29.078]  Then I ran into him once on the street, and they said, yeah, we'll come on sometime.
[00:49:29.078 --> 00:49:31.461]  But I never even followed it up.
[00:49:31.461 --> 00:49:36.486]  That's because I'm so focused on the news.
[00:49:37.841 --> 00:49:40.123]  But it would be interesting to have Nolan Ryan on here talking about the New World Order.
[00:49:40.123 --> 00:49:43.807]  The point is, is that that isn't what matters.
[00:49:43.807 --> 00:49:45.408]  People say, well, then why have Nolan Ryan on?
[00:49:45.408 --> 00:49:51.053]  Well, because we can use his star appeal to actually get people to realize that he cares about the New World Order.
[00:49:51.053 --> 00:49:52.134]  He understands what's going on.
[00:49:52.134 --> 00:50:00.943]  I mean, we've got to change our priorities and it's got to happen now.
[00:50:03.482 --> 00:50:05.444]  Or there's no future of this nation, this republic.
[00:50:05.444 --> 00:50:09.768]  But I'll get into my full breakdown of LeBron James coming up.
[00:50:09.768 --> 00:50:20.218]  When we come back from break, I'm gonna get into war news, financial news, and then this other news here in the first five-minute segment dealing with the Mark of the Beast systems going in.
[00:50:20.218 --> 00:50:24.082]  And I told you, you're gonna face print, you're gonna thumb print to buy and sell.
[00:50:24.082 --> 00:50:27.885]  Because there's gonna be a graduated sales tax, because they can't sales tax the poor.
[00:50:29.215 --> 00:50:30.796]  And so that's how they're going to roll it out as well.
[00:50:30.796 --> 00:50:32.257]  Everybody's got a thumbprint and face cam.
[00:50:32.257 --> 00:50:38.021]  When you pay at the cashless counters to make sure you're not cheating on your sales tax, it's going to be a national sales tax.
[00:50:38.021 --> 00:50:41.603]  That's what the tanning taxes and all the rest of it's 10% federal sales tax.
[00:50:41.603 --> 00:50:46.046]  And it's going to go in on cigarettes, beer, it's going to expand it, everything else.
[00:50:46.046 --> 00:50:52.951]  But first they sell the fake moral people out there who aren't really moral about, Oh, let us get this tax too, because that's something you don't agree with morally.
[00:50:52.951 --> 00:50:54.232]  He's drinking wine.
[00:50:54.232 --> 00:50:55.933]  And the next it's going to be your food.
[00:50:55.933 --> 00:50:56.753]  So don't be idiots.
[00:50:56.753 --> 00:50:58.755]  I want them to sell you the mark of the beast.
[00:50:59.155 --> 00:50:59.241]  Yeah.
[00:51:00.711 --> 00:51:05.254]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:51:05.254 --> 00:51:06.174]  Number 1.
[00:51:06.174 --> 00:51:09.597]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:51:09.597 --> 00:51:10.457]  Number 2.
[00:51:10.457 --> 00:51:15.340]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:16.101]  It's true.
[00:51:16.101 --> 00:51:20.964]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:51:20.964 --> 00:51:21.784]  Number 3.
[00:51:21.784 --> 00:51:25.367]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:51:25.367 --> 00:51:29.069]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:51:29.289 --> 00:51:30.090]  Number 4.
[00:51:30.090 --> 00:51:32.853]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:51:32.853 --> 00:51:36.517]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:51:36.517 --> 00:51:37.318]  Number 5.
[00:51:37.318 --> 00:51:41.463]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:51:41.463 --> 00:51:46.228]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:51:46.508 --> 00:51:50.674]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:51:50.674 --> 00:51:52.476]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:51:52.476 --> 00:51:54.719]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[00:52:00.939 --> 00:52:03.322]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:52:03.322 --> 00:52:05.524]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:52:05.524 --> 00:52:08.868]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:52:08.868 --> 00:52:13.974]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:13.974 --> 00:52:18.179]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:18.479 --> 00:52:20.821]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:20.821 --> 00:52:23.704]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:23.704 --> 00:52:26.627]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:26.627 --> 00:52:34.214]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:39.982]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:39.982 --> 00:52:42.803]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:42.803 --> 00:52:46.484]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:46.484 --> 00:52:47.565]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:47.565 --> 00:52:48.905]  You're everyone else.
[00:52:48.905 --> 00:52:50.386]  Invisible Empire.

[00:54:14.654 --> 00:54:27.046]  Coming up in about 35 minutes we're going to start the simulcast of the syndicated radio broadcast at PrisonPlanet.tv and pull Living Color, all the past shows, going back now almost three years.
[00:54:27.046 --> 00:54:31.250]  The video archives are archived at PrisonPlanet.tv starting Monday.
[00:54:31.250 --> 00:54:31.771]  We're going to
[00:54:33.152 --> 00:54:37.817]  Simulcast the entire show every day at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:54:37.817 --> 00:54:42.782]  I figure that's just easier than some days doing four hours, some days three hours, some days two hours.
[00:54:42.782 --> 00:54:44.604]  Simulcast, we always do at least two hours.
[00:54:45.922 --> 00:54:48.124]  So that is coming up.
[00:54:48.124 --> 00:54:53.147]  Let's get into some of the military and espionage news that's out today.
[00:54:53.147 --> 00:54:54.968]  Obama Administration.
[00:54:54.968 --> 00:54:59.452]  Israel has right to nuclear capability for deterrence purposes.
[00:54:59.452 --> 00:55:00.793]  Haratz.
[00:55:00.793 --> 00:55:14.562]  Wow, there has been a law for more than 30 years in Israel that it's illegal to talk about the fact that Israel has hundreds and hundreds of high-tech nukes and have had them since the early 60s, given to them by the US.
[00:55:14.562 --> 00:55:15.303]  It has been illegal.
[00:55:18.499 --> 00:55:24.513]  Imagine, it's like the D notices they have in England where they can arrest you.
[00:55:24.513 --> 00:55:25.495]  Arrest you.
[00:55:27.466 --> 00:55:30.549]  If you report on something the government has ordered you not to report on.
[00:55:30.549 --> 00:55:33.432]  Generally, it's high officials being caught with small children.
[00:55:33.432 --> 00:55:34.934]  Literally.
[00:55:34.934 --> 00:55:36.415]  Because that's the club.
[00:55:36.415 --> 00:55:39.558]  I mean, who else would rob society, set up carbon taxes?
[00:55:39.558 --> 00:55:41.921]  Bunch of sick perverts that hate everybody.
[00:55:41.921 --> 00:55:43.882]  You better realize how dangerous these people are.
[00:55:43.882 --> 00:55:44.924]  Look at Roman emperors.
[00:55:44.924 --> 00:55:46.545]  Look at what happened in history.
[00:55:46.545 --> 00:55:49.128]  They always go crazy and turn into Baron Harkonnen.
[00:55:50.569 --> 00:55:51.930]  Obama Administration.
[00:55:51.930 --> 00:55:54.691]  Israel has right to nuclear capability for deterrence purposes.
[00:55:54.691 --> 00:55:57.553]  See, everybody just started pointing out that Israel had nukes.
[00:55:57.553 --> 00:55:58.813]  And now, they can't.
[00:55:58.813 --> 00:56:00.734]  Even just a month ago, they were still denying they had them.
[00:56:00.734 --> 00:56:01.855]  Now they don't.
[00:56:01.855 --> 00:56:03.536]  Harats.
[00:56:03.536 --> 00:56:07.458]  And so, they can have 400 nukes and be threatening to use them on Iran.
[00:56:07.458 --> 00:56:10.820]  But Iran can't have peaceful nuclear reactors.
[00:56:10.820 --> 00:56:12.080]  I mean, it's just wrong, folks.
[00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:13.101]  We don't want World War III.
[00:56:15.751 --> 00:56:24.394]  And if we keep saying it's wrong and then keep saying no, they may not start the war with Iran, but the globalists may stage a nuke attack on this country.
[00:56:24.394 --> 00:56:26.955]  Don't think they won't do it.
[00:56:26.955 --> 00:56:27.455]  Here's another one.
[00:56:27.455 --> 00:56:31.676]  Obama says, Israeli suspicious of me because my middle name is Hussein.
[00:56:31.676 --> 00:56:31.816]  U.S.
[00:56:31.816 --> 00:56:36.238]  President tells Channel 2 Israel is unlikely to attack Iran without coordinating with the U.S.
[00:56:38.322 --> 00:56:40.303]  They're suspicious of you.
[00:56:40.303 --> 00:56:42.984]  Your White House Chief of Staff is an admitted Mossad officer.
[00:56:42.984 --> 00:56:43.925]  Admitted!
[00:56:43.925 --> 00:56:47.286]  His father, founder of the Israeli Irgun.
[00:56:47.286 --> 00:56:49.968]  I mean, come on, folks.
[00:56:49.968 --> 00:56:53.489]  It's not Israel-bashing to not want the White House to be filled with Israeli operatives.
[00:56:53.489 --> 00:56:56.131]  I mean, the guy's a member of the Israeli military.
[00:56:56.131 --> 00:56:58.872]  I mean, this is a disgusting joke.
[00:56:58.872 --> 00:57:02.854]  Our government is just filled with British, European Union, and Israeli spies.
[00:57:02.854 --> 00:57:06.616]  But meanwhile, we're all scared to death of some redhead sex operative.
[00:57:07.728 --> 00:57:14.053]  Hezbollah readying for urban war in southern Lebanon, IDF warns.
[00:57:14.053 --> 00:57:16.175]  Another Haaretz story.
[00:57:16.175 --> 00:57:18.256]  Haaretz, Haaretz, potato, patata.
[00:57:18.256 --> 00:57:21.119]  I get emails every day saying, it's Haaretz, it's Haaretz.
[00:57:21.119 --> 00:57:30.546]  Deployment of UN forces has pushed militants into buildup areas where international troops have no authority, army says.
[00:57:30.546 --> 00:57:32.248]  Israel says they may have to strike.
[00:57:33.285 --> 00:57:35.686]  See, and that's the excuse to go after Iran.
[00:57:35.686 --> 00:57:38.107]  They're funding Hezbollah.
[00:57:38.107 --> 00:57:40.788]  They're funding other groups.
[00:57:40.788 --> 00:57:44.970]  Of course, Hamas was founded by Israel.
[00:57:44.970 --> 00:57:47.051]  You know, I tell people that and they look at me like I'm crazy.
[00:57:47.051 --> 00:57:47.851]  That's Haaretz.
[00:57:47.851 --> 00:57:49.411]  That's Jerusalem Post.
[00:57:49.411 --> 00:57:51.092]  That's been admitted since the 70s.
[00:57:51.092 --> 00:57:54.133]  Israel created Hamas.
[00:57:54.133 --> 00:58:02.277]  That's like me saying the first coach of the Dallas Cowboys was... Who was the guy who wore the fedoras?
[00:58:02.277 --> 00:58:02.897]  Mark Landry?
[00:58:03.902 --> 00:58:04.642]  Yeah.
[00:58:04.642 --> 00:58:06.583]  Or Roger Stallback was one of their quarterbacks.
[00:58:06.583 --> 00:58:09.203]  I mean, it's well known.
[00:58:09.203 --> 00:58:10.203]  Yeah, Tom Landry.
[00:58:10.203 --> 00:58:13.164]  I can't remember all this stuff, man.
[00:58:13.164 --> 00:58:16.885]  Even though my grandfather at UT was his roommate.
[00:58:16.885 --> 00:58:19.066]  And my grandpa played for UT football.
[00:58:19.066 --> 00:58:20.926]  Won first and stayed on the, uh, what was it?
[00:58:20.926 --> 00:58:23.507]  The High Hurls.
[00:58:23.507 --> 00:58:23.827]  Yeah.
[00:58:23.827 --> 00:58:26.767]  And we never talk about it, though.
[00:58:26.767 --> 00:58:27.307]  I can't remember.
[00:58:27.307 --> 00:58:28.028]  It's Tom Landry.
[00:58:28.028 --> 00:58:28.628]  What did I call him?
[00:58:28.628 --> 00:58:29.168]  Something else?
[00:58:30.464 --> 00:58:32.925]  Yeah, Paul Landry.
[00:58:32.925 --> 00:58:34.306]  Oh, boy.
[00:58:34.306 --> 00:58:37.128]  Alright, we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:58:37.128 --> 00:58:38.709]  Stay with us, second hour straight ahead.
[00:58:38.709 --> 00:58:48.034]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:50.023 --> 00:58:52.364]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:58:52.364 --> 00:58:54.745]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:58:54.745 --> 00:58:57.947]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:58:57.947 --> 00:59:03.050]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:59:03.050 --> 00:59:07.252]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:59:07.552 --> 00:59:09.913]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:59:09.913 --> 00:59:12.454]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:59:12.454 --> 00:59:15.716]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:59:15.716 --> 00:59:23.299]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:59:23.655 --> 00:59:29.039]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:59:29.039 --> 00:59:31.881]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:59:31.881 --> 00:59:35.584]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:59:35.584 --> 00:59:36.644]  And I got news for you.
[00:59:36.644 --> 00:59:37.985]  You're everyone else.
[00:59:37.985 --> 00:59:39.487]  Invisible Empire.

[00:59:53.177 --> 00:59:55.579]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.579 --> 01:00:05.265]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.265 --> 01:00:06.586]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.586 --> 01:00:08.348]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.348 --> 01:00:09.528]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.528 --> 01:00:11.690]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.690 --> 01:00:13.251]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.251 --> 01:00:17.434]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.434 --> 01:00:21.497]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:27.847 --> 01:00:30.449]  Well, the United States is sliding into depression.
[01:00:30.449 --> 01:00:35.172]  Israel and the United States say there may be a strike on Iran, including using nuclear weapons.
[01:00:35.172 --> 01:00:39.835]  The dollar is on the verge of collapsing.
[01:00:39.835 --> 01:00:41.076]  None of that matters.
[01:00:41.076 --> 01:00:43.598]  LeBron James going to the Miami Heat.
[01:00:43.598 --> 01:00:44.538]  That's what's really important.
[01:00:44.538 --> 01:00:48.241]  And I'll talk about that coming up in the next segment.
[01:00:48.241 --> 01:00:53.624]  But continuing, Ahmed Denegide brands U.S.
[01:00:53.624 --> 01:00:55.886]  dictator a head of summit.
[01:00:57.293 --> 01:01:07.281]  Iran President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad called the United States a global dictator and lashed out at Israel after arriving in Nigeria to meet fellow Muslim leaders at a summit.
[01:01:07.281 --> 01:01:09.303]  They are the self-proclaimed leaders.
[01:01:09.303 --> 01:01:12.445]  Everybody should know that self-proclaimed leadership is dictatorial.
[01:01:12.445 --> 01:01:19.891]  Ahmadinejad referred to the United States, told an audience of hundreds at the Iranian embassy.
[01:01:19.891 --> 01:01:24.996]  The era of dictatorship is over, he added through an official translator.
[01:01:24.996 --> 01:01:26.116]  Well, I gotta say that
[01:01:28.391 --> 01:01:33.876]  Iran is not exactly a free society, but I've got to be honest, the United States is not.
[01:01:33.876 --> 01:01:36.838]  I mean, we're trying to take our states back.
[01:01:36.838 --> 01:01:42.683]  Under the Tenth Amendment, Arizona should be able to protect its borders, and the traitorous federal government that's been bought off by foreign interests won't let us.
[01:01:43.888 --> 01:01:47.351]  But just because the United States is corrupt doesn't mean Iran's perfect either.
[01:01:47.351 --> 01:01:50.213]  All these nations, that's human history, are corrupt.
[01:01:50.213 --> 01:01:51.735]  That's why the founders were so right.
[01:01:51.735 --> 01:01:55.858]  You gotta keep government tiny, or it'll run all over you.
[01:01:55.858 --> 01:01:58.020]  How many dictatorships can you name?
[01:01:58.020 --> 01:02:01.964]  How many free societies that are truly free can you name?
[01:02:01.964 --> 01:02:04.466]  How many corrupt countries can you name?
[01:02:04.466 --> 01:02:06.648]  How many countries that aren't corrupt can you name?
[01:02:06.648 --> 01:02:08.069]  Maybe Switzerland?
[01:02:08.069 --> 01:02:09.710]  They're not perfect.
[01:02:09.710 --> 01:02:11.492]  I mean, who?
[01:02:11.492 --> 01:02:11.652]  Who?
[01:02:14.465 --> 01:02:21.746]  Continuing, look at this Russian bomber incursion, Bill Gertz, Washington Times story.
[01:02:21.746 --> 01:02:29.408]  Russian bomber incursions, Russia is continuing to fly strategic nuclear bombers near U.S.
[01:02:29.408 --> 01:02:36.629]  and Canadian airspace because the Russian military is seeking to maintain the quote, illusion of power, the commander of the U.S.
[01:02:36.629 --> 01:02:41.070]  Northern Command says.
[01:02:41.070 --> 01:02:41.750]  Admiral James,
[01:02:43.493 --> 01:02:56.839]  Winfield Jr., who took over Northcom, those are the boys that helped cover up the 9-11 attacks, said, in some cases, it's about the illusion of power, where power is not quite there.
[01:02:56.839 --> 01:03:04.463]  Boy, that sounds like famous last words with the Titanic, the captain saying, not even God can sink this ship.
[01:03:04.463 --> 01:03:06.664]  Maiden voyage.
[01:03:06.664 --> 01:03:12.607]  To the bottom.
[01:03:12.607 --> 01:03:13.087]  To the bottom.
[01:03:15.031 --> 01:03:33.098]  Yeah, okay, Russia isn't all it was 20-30 years ago, but it's got at least 40,000 nuclear weapons and supersonic Topol-M missiles and nuclear submarines with the equivalent of US Polaris weapons and cruise missiles.
[01:03:33.098 --> 01:03:38.160]  Not just missiles, but cruise missiles.
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:39.821]  Not just up-down missiles, but
[01:03:41.567 --> 01:04:03.608]  Terrain mapping cruise missiles and they're all over our coast and Chinese subs are popping up behind our aircraft carriers undetected probably because the people on board are watching LeBron James on ESPN and they've got Russian Bear bombers and others flying all over the edge of our airspace with nuclear weapons on board and you've got a North Com commander
[01:04:06.257 --> 01:04:13.241]  that took over NORAD, that stood down on 9-11, can't deal with supposedly 19 hijackers from Saudi Arabia.
[01:04:13.241 --> 01:04:14.722]  Of course, that's all a lie.
[01:04:14.722 --> 01:04:17.663]  NORTHCOM ran the attack.
[01:04:17.663 --> 01:04:20.885]  And yes, NORTHCOM existed before they officially set it up in 2002.
[01:04:20.885 --> 01:04:25.808]  Go research that before you send me an email.
[01:04:25.808 --> 01:04:28.309]  And now he's saying that this is the illusion of power.
[01:04:28.309 --> 01:04:28.769]  Well, you know what?
[01:04:28.769 --> 01:04:31.191]  The New World Order is all about the illusion of power.
[01:04:31.191 --> 01:04:33.012]  And yeah, Russia is all about the illusion of power.
[01:04:33.851 --> 01:04:35.312]  That's what all this thuggery is about.
[01:04:35.312 --> 01:04:38.235]  That's why they told cops to slap the public around.
[01:04:38.235 --> 01:04:40.837]  To pimp slap us.
[01:04:40.837 --> 01:04:45.602]  So we learn how to submit and learn who our masters are and learn.
[01:04:45.602 --> 01:04:46.983]  You ever seen a dog that's been beaten?
[01:04:46.983 --> 01:04:49.506]  Somebody raises their hand to it, it cowers.
[01:04:49.506 --> 01:04:50.927]  Yeah, that's the American people.
[01:04:50.927 --> 01:04:54.750]  So, you're all about the illusion of power too, you North Com traders.
[01:04:54.750 --> 01:04:57.073]  You guys work for offshore banks and you know it.
[01:04:57.073 --> 01:04:58.274]  Bunch of global trash.
[01:04:58.274 --> 01:04:59.194]  Be right back.
[01:05:00.250 --> 01:05:01.891]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:05:01.891 --> 01:05:05.273]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.

[01:05:51.881 --> 01:05:52.161]  Thank you!
[01:05:59.912 --> 01:06:04.876]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:06:04.876 --> 01:06:05.877]  What have we got?
[01:06:05.877 --> 01:06:08.319]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:06:08.319 --> 01:06:09.320]  A republic.
[01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:11.982]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:06:11.982 --> 01:06:14.244]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:06:14.244 --> 01:06:16.266]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:06:16.266 --> 01:06:17.947]  So they think they own our land?
[01:06:17.947 --> 01:06:19.269]  They think they own our water?
[01:06:19.269 --> 01:06:19.869]  Children?
[01:06:19.869 --> 01:06:20.990]  Our education?
[01:06:20.990 --> 01:06:21.831]  Our money?
[01:06:21.831 --> 01:06:25.474]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:06:25.834 --> 01:06:30.799]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:06:30.799 --> 01:06:31.840]  We have the facts.
[01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:32.981]  We have the Constitution.
[01:06:32.981 --> 01:06:33.902]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:06:33.902 --> 01:06:34.783]  We have common law.
[01:06:34.783 --> 01:06:37.305]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:06:37.305 --> 01:06:41.089]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:06:41.189 --> 01:06:46.135]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:06:46.135 --> 01:06:47.636]  A new tool in the Info War.
[01:06:47.636 --> 01:06:48.738]  Don't tread on me.
[01:06:48.738 --> 01:06:55.605]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[01:06:59.750 --> 01:07:04.291]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:07:04.291 --> 01:07:05.211]  Number 1.
[01:07:05.211 --> 01:07:08.632]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:07:08.632 --> 01:07:09.492]  Number 2.
[01:07:09.492 --> 01:07:14.394]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:07:14.394 --> 01:07:15.134]  It's true.
[01:07:15.134 --> 01:07:19.995]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:07:19.995 --> 01:07:20.835]  Number 3.
[01:07:20.835 --> 01:07:24.416]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:07:24.416 --> 01:07:28.117]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:07:28.317 --> 01:07:29.117]  Number 4.
[01:07:29.117 --> 01:07:31.878]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:07:31.878 --> 01:07:35.559]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:07:35.559 --> 01:07:36.339]  Number 5.
[01:07:36.339 --> 01:07:40.500]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:45.542]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:07:45.542 --> 01:07:49.723]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:49.723 --> 01:07:51.504]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:51.504 --> 01:07:56.105]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[01:07:56.425 --> 01:07:56.585]  877-327-0365.
[01:07:56.585 --> 01:07:58.647]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:07:58.647 --> 01:08:02.871]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:20.143 --> 01:08:21.944]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:21.944 --> 01:08:24.325]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:08:24.325 --> 01:08:30.869]  We are now an hour and eight minutes into the second hour of this Friday edition.
[01:08:30.869 --> 01:08:40.074]  And of course, we're going to have Ted Nugent coming up, joining us here in about 25 minutes from now to talk about a host of issues.
[01:08:40.074 --> 01:08:45.337]  Ted Nugent, frequent guest over the years, always informative and interesting.
[01:08:45.337 --> 01:08:46.218]  So that is coming up.
[01:08:47.566 --> 01:09:04.192]  I shot a video last night as I left the office at about 6.30 because I was in the coffee room and we had television news on and they were talking about LeBron James, LeBron James, the decision is going to be at 9 o'clock Eastern.
[01:09:04.192 --> 01:09:05.232]  Tune into ESPN.
[01:09:05.232 --> 01:09:07.273]  We're all going to find out the decision.
[01:09:07.273 --> 01:09:14.716]  And I remember three weeks ago up in his home city where the Cavaliers were based,
[01:09:15.595 --> 01:09:35.790]  That up to 4,000 people showed up at an event, and they were at this event, and it was a LeBron James appreciation meeting at the local convention center, and they were literally singing songs to him, worshiping him, and he wasn't even gonna show up, so the team called him and said, you better get here.
[01:09:35.790 --> 01:09:43.996]  So he showed up, even though he knew it was coming up in the last 10 minutes, was noncommittal, he can go to Florida, one of the few states that doesn't have a state income tax,
[01:09:44.796 --> 01:09:45.056]  I don't
[01:10:05.208 --> 01:10:12.037]  How pathetic is this that you can't get these people to become angry?
[01:10:12.037 --> 01:10:19.107]  You can't get these 4,000 people in the city where his team was based in Ohio
[01:10:20.228 --> 01:10:29.494]  To go and protest the fact that Ohio is one of the 46 states listed by the Feds and Bloomberg is on the verge of total bankruptcy and collapse.
[01:10:29.494 --> 01:10:35.538]  I mean, I've seen articles in Ohio where more than half of the sheriff's deputies in major departments are being laid off.
[01:10:35.538 --> 01:10:38.399]  And where sheriffs are saying, buy guns, we can't protect you.
[01:10:38.399 --> 01:10:40.381]  I mean, it's collapsing like Mexico or something.
[01:10:41.481 --> 01:10:49.204]  You can't get 4,000 people out to protest a government takeover of health care or anti-gun laws in that state.
[01:10:49.204 --> 01:10:51.385]  And it's the same thing all over the country.
[01:10:51.385 --> 01:11:02.609]  But the media feeds into this, the mainstream media, and promotes some overpaid person that at the end of the day just does not matter.
[01:11:02.609 --> 01:11:03.690]  Like LeBron James.
[01:11:05.552 --> 01:11:07.953]  Our country is going into a depression.
[01:11:07.953 --> 01:11:17.279]  Our country is on the verge of World War III that could quite possibly be triggered with an attack on Iran.
[01:11:17.279 --> 01:11:19.460]  They're openly announcing the end of the dollar.
[01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:30.527]  They're openly announcing that they want to devalue our currency and go to this global currency, the SDR, backed up by a basket of currencies, and we will pay taxes on
[01:11:35.345 --> 01:11:41.230]  All of the activities that we're involved in to this global offshore system.
[01:11:41.230 --> 01:11:57.544]  Carbon taxes paid to the very same private banks that have bankrupted our economy by creating 600 trillion, in the words of the Washington Post, of counterfeit, derivative, made-up financial instruments that they use to buy off media, sports teams, government, factories.
[01:11:57.544 --> 01:11:59.986]  Globalism, naphtha and ghat, is treason.
[01:11:59.986 --> 01:12:02.108]  It is the overthrow of our country.
[01:12:03.007 --> 01:12:12.970]  And I saw some of the comments, most of the comments, I'd say running, you know, 9 out of 10 were supporting me pointing out this is bread in the circus, the fall of Rome, a political distraction.
[01:12:12.970 --> 01:12:19.752]  But some were like, I just love LeBron, he makes me feel good about myself and proud of my city, proud of my state.
[01:12:19.752 --> 01:12:21.152]  How dare you?
[01:12:21.152 --> 01:12:23.613]  Look, all I'm saying is, you got your priorities screwed up.
[01:12:24.619 --> 01:12:26.581]  And there's a reason this country's going bankrupt.
[01:12:26.581 --> 01:12:29.124]  There's a reason crooked politicians are running wild.
[01:12:29.124 --> 01:12:31.727]  Because people don't know who their state rep is.
[01:12:31.727 --> 01:12:33.588]  They don't know who their federal rep is.
[01:12:33.588 --> 01:12:35.791]  They don't know who their senator is.
[01:12:35.791 --> 01:12:37.092]  They don't know who their mayor is.
[01:12:37.092 --> 01:12:38.954]  I mean, take Austin, Texas.
[01:12:38.954 --> 01:12:43.859]  It is a federal violation of law and state law to put a toll road on an existing road.
[01:12:43.859 --> 01:12:47.083]  The second most busy road in Texas is Mopac.
[01:12:48.707 --> 01:12:51.568]  And they'll never expand the lanes, even though they have room.
[01:12:51.568 --> 01:12:54.650]  They'll never put a double-decker in the last 30 years.
[01:12:54.650 --> 01:13:04.854]  They proposed five years ago, three years ago, and two years ago, as part of the Napa Superhighway, to put a toll road on it and shut two of the three lanes and make them toll road, where you've got to pay.
[01:13:04.854 --> 01:13:06.514]  How are people going to get off?
[01:13:06.514 --> 01:13:08.135]  But that's not the issue.
[01:13:08.135 --> 01:13:09.936]  The issue here is
[01:13:12.028 --> 01:13:12.248]  That's
[01:13:32.193 --> 01:13:36.719]  Can we get the 100,000 UT fans that go worship the UT football team?
[01:13:36.719 --> 01:13:38.761]  100,000 people to City Hall?
[01:13:38.761 --> 01:13:40.603]  Of the million people that live metro?
[01:13:40.603 --> 01:13:47.051]  To stop this taking over of 183, Mopac, and every other major road they're gonna put toll roads on?
[01:13:47.051 --> 01:13:47.752]  Five dollars?
[01:13:48.996 --> 01:13:52.537]  Each way, on each road, screwing up the traffic?
[01:13:52.537 --> 01:13:59.679]  When we paid for these roads with tax money, and the money's going to offshore private toll road corporations that are taking over our nation?
[01:13:59.679 --> 01:14:00.839]  That's globalism!
[01:14:00.839 --> 01:14:02.059]  That's high treason!
[01:14:02.059 --> 01:14:03.659]  This is tyranny!
[01:14:03.659 --> 01:14:14.202]  Let's go ahead and go to this video that we shot that's gone viral, where I break down the facts, and the headline is, as the United States collapses, media worships LeBron James.
[01:14:14.202 --> 01:14:18.063]  Decide what you want, a future, or to worship stupid fake icons?
[01:14:18.063 --> 01:14:18.423]  Here it is.
[01:14:24.665 --> 01:14:26.887]  Societies don't change.
[01:14:26.887 --> 01:14:35.597]  Whether it was the Roman Empire or Nazi Germany, the population is obsessed with sports and petty celebrities.
[01:14:35.597 --> 01:14:37.819]  And the United States is no different.
[01:14:37.819 --> 01:14:43.685]  MSNBC, the New York Times, they're all reporting that we are going into a depression.
[01:14:43.685 --> 01:14:45.847]  One of the greatest depressions in world history.
[01:14:46.608 --> 01:14:53.373]  And our decadent, slob-like public, and that's not everyone, but large percentages of the public, could care less.
[01:14:53.373 --> 01:14:55.735]  They're not involved in their communities.
[01:14:55.735 --> 01:14:59.378]  We've got 46 states on the verge of bankruptcy.
[01:14:59.378 --> 01:15:01.980]  The government's raising taxes on every level.
[01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:04.422]  The border with Mexico is collapsing.
[01:15:04.422 --> 01:15:06.203]  Mexico has collapsed.
[01:15:06.203 --> 01:15:09.726]  And the public doesn't care, because the media has set the agenda.
[01:15:09.726 --> 01:15:13.529]  And they tell you to care about LeBron James and his decision.
[01:15:13.809 --> 01:15:17.131]  And he's playing into it and he's going to announce his stupid decision.
[01:15:17.131 --> 01:15:20.493]  It doesn't matter what basketball team he goes to.
[01:15:20.493 --> 01:15:23.295]  This is a distraction by design.
[01:15:23.295 --> 01:15:33.581]  We have the governor of the state he's currently living in, in a bizarre, we are LeBron, we are the world, literal worship fest with hundreds of celebrities.
[01:15:33.581 --> 01:15:34.441]  This is sickening.
[01:15:40.603 --> 01:15:57.070]  Imagine the Ohio government begging and pleading on television and serenading LeBron James with hundreds of other celebrities when Ohio is one of the states slated to go completely bankrupt.
[01:15:57.070 --> 01:15:58.410]  We're going into a depression.
[01:15:58.410 --> 01:16:02.492]  They're about to launch World War III with Iran openly.
[01:16:02.492 --> 01:16:04.713]  Fox News is reporting as if it's a good thing.
[01:16:05.513 --> 01:16:14.620]  In New York State and Illinois that troops have helped arrest thousands of citizens and are doing gun sweeps in people's homes and searching people's cars.
[01:16:14.620 --> 01:16:17.662]  We're going in to marshal law.
[01:16:17.662 --> 01:16:20.143]  Offshore banks have overthrown the US.
[01:16:20.143 --> 01:16:24.446]  They've stolen tens of trillions of dollars like we're some third world country they're looting.
[01:16:24.446 --> 01:16:26.108]  Everything's going to hell in a handbasket.
[01:16:26.108 --> 01:16:32.012]  So if you want to know why your children have no future, if you want to know why you're bankrupt, if you want to know why you're in debt, if you want to know
[01:16:32.372 --> 01:16:32.692]  Why?
[01:16:32.692 --> 01:16:36.536]  You have no future and have lost your job or are getting your pay cut.
[01:16:36.536 --> 01:16:39.239]  It's because your priorities are wrong.
[01:16:39.239 --> 01:16:48.548]  It's because you let that idiot box, the television program you since the days that your mother and father set you in front of the TV for 12 hours a day in your crap-filled diapers.
[01:16:49.289 --> 01:16:54.913]  It's not too late to admit we're a sick, decadent, degenerate society crumbling.
[01:16:54.913 --> 01:16:56.374]  We are Rome.
[01:16:56.374 --> 01:16:57.575]  It's 410.
[01:16:57.575 --> 01:16:59.696]  We're about to collapse, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:16:59.696 --> 01:17:00.497]  I know you won't know.
[01:17:00.497 --> 01:17:02.058]  You know about LeBron James.
[01:17:02.058 --> 01:17:05.700]  You don't know 410 is when Rome completely fell to Alaric, the Visigoth leader.
[01:17:05.700 --> 01:17:06.961]  You better learn history.
[01:17:06.961 --> 01:17:08.222]  This is dangerous.
[01:17:08.222 --> 01:17:09.663]  Don't say you weren't warned.
[01:17:09.663 --> 01:17:10.904]  The globalist engineers.
[01:17:11.624 --> 01:17:20.028]  The globalist social engineers look at you and how pathetic you are and how the whole world is waiting to see where LeBron James goes.
[01:17:20.028 --> 01:17:24.531]  The social controllers look at you and see how you're obsessed with LeBron James.
[01:17:24.531 --> 01:17:26.191]  And they decide, we got a bunch of schmucks.
[01:17:26.191 --> 01:17:27.552]  We've got a bunch of idiots.
[01:17:27.552 --> 01:17:30.313]  We got a bunch of morons right where we want them.
[01:17:30.313 --> 01:17:31.654]  Let's destroy their society.
[01:17:31.654 --> 01:17:32.354]  Let's loot it.
[01:17:32.354 --> 01:17:33.855]  Let's pass carbon taxes.
[01:17:33.855 --> 01:17:35.376]  Let's expand NAFTA and GATT.
[01:17:35.376 --> 01:17:38.257]  Let's announce an end to the dollar as the global reserve currency.
[01:17:38.257 --> 01:17:39.518]  Do you know what that means?
[01:17:39.518 --> 01:17:41.079]  We've already lost almost all our industry.
[01:17:41.539 --> 01:17:42.720]  We're already in a depression.
[01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:48.224]  When they get rid of the dollar as the world reserve currency, your life, as you know it, is officially over.
[01:17:48.224 --> 01:17:51.766]  You're going to be a third world slave like they are in Mexico or Nigeria.
[01:17:51.766 --> 01:17:52.647]  And you know what?
[01:17:52.647 --> 01:17:54.869]  Those people down there at least know why they're slaves.
[01:17:54.869 --> 01:18:02.034]  You are so stupid and so focused on crap, you'll probably still be talking about Lindsay Lohan when you're living as a homeless person on the street.
[01:18:02.634 --> 01:18:05.898]  My friends, we've got to set our priorities and set them now.
[01:18:05.898 --> 01:18:07.481]  Liberty or tyranny.
[01:18:07.481 --> 01:18:10.264]  You've got to wake up and decide what is important to you.
[01:18:10.264 --> 01:18:11.566]  Saving our republic?
[01:18:11.566 --> 01:18:13.388]  Stopping the globalist takeover?
[01:18:13.388 --> 01:18:17.213]  Or knowing all the mindless trivia about LeBron James and Lindsay Lohan?
[01:18:17.714 --> 01:18:20.556]  There isn't much more time.
[01:18:20.556 --> 01:18:26.061]  I'm begging you to ask yourselves to look in the mirror and really realize how sick this is.
[01:18:26.061 --> 01:18:35.448]  It's not bad like a basketball game, but it is mentally ill and sick to buy into this manufactured hype and to have government officials that should be working for the people.
[01:18:35.448 --> 01:18:42.834]  We're going to come back and finish the last minute or two of this in the next segment, but why does the Bible talk about have no gods before me?
[01:18:43.697 --> 01:18:58.820]  Well, you got the God who's telling you don't kill, don't steal, you know, love your neighbor, or you can have the God of LeBron James, or the God of Adolf Hitler, or the God of Newt Gingrich, or the God of the environment.
[01:18:58.820 --> 01:19:04.501]  Humans idolize something, and what you idolize is then how you build your life.
[01:19:04.501 --> 01:19:10.582]  You build your life around what you think is important, what you invest your time and energy in.
[01:19:10.582 --> 01:19:12.962]  You're on a beautiful planet in the middle of the universe,
[01:19:14.326 --> 01:19:32.001]  We're spinning around a sun, and there's rainbows, and the Van Allen Radiation Belt, and the Aurora Borealis, and life, and birds, and bees, and just all this incredible majesty of creation around us, the oceans.
[01:19:33.584 --> 01:19:49.191]  The miracle of procreation, the beauty of art and literature, and everything is debased down to people putting a basket, and putting a ball in a basket, or worshiping Lindsay Lohan.
[01:19:49.191 --> 01:19:57.274]  This is why we're in so much trouble, because our art and our literature and our culture has been dumbed down to this level.
[01:19:57.274 --> 01:19:58.295]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[01:20:01.482 --> 01:20:05.243]  So you think the massive Gulf oil leak won't affect the air you breathe?
[01:20:05.243 --> 01:20:06.563]  Think again!
[01:20:06.563 --> 01:20:14.205]  Benzene, a toxic gas emitted from crude oil and a known carcinogen, is now airborne traveling hundreds, even thousands of miles inland.
[01:20:14.205 --> 01:20:21.447]  Whether you live near the Gulf or not, benzene and other volatile organic compounds could cause adverse reactions to those living inside your home.
[01:20:21.447 --> 01:20:26.828]  NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, came to airfiltersandpurifiers.com for answers.
[01:20:27.048 --> 01:20:30.011]  On how to clean the air on boats, aiding in the Gulf cleanup.

[01:22:29.813 --> 01:22:31.054]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:31.054 --> 01:22:35.617]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:22:35.617 --> 01:22:41.421]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:22:41.421 --> 01:22:45.083]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:22:45.083 --> 01:22:47.905]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:47.905 --> 01:22:52.848]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:22:52.848 --> 01:22:53.149]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:53.149 --> 01:22:54.490]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:59.633 --> 01:22:59.884]  Yeah.
[01:23:00.495 --> 01:23:03.497]  You've seen our Sinofresh banner on the GCN website.
[01:23:03.497 --> 01:23:05.558]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[01:23:05.558 --> 01:23:08.319]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[01:23:08.319 --> 01:23:10.540]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[01:23:10.540 --> 01:23:11.941]  Okay, here it comes.
[01:23:11.941 --> 01:23:13.842]  But first, the facts.
[01:23:13.842 --> 01:23:15.783]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[01:23:15.783 --> 01:23:17.764]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[01:23:17.764 --> 01:23:21.446]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[01:23:21.446 --> 01:23:29.211]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.
[01:23:29.211 --> 01:23:29.811]  Sinofresh.

[01:23:49.436 --> 01:23:49.816]  Mention GCN.

[01:23:50.736 --> 01:23:50.996]  It works!
[01:24:00.071 --> 01:24:01.652]  More time.
[01:24:01.652 --> 01:24:07.157]  I'm begging you to ask yourselves to look in the mirror and really realize how sick this is.
[01:24:07.157 --> 01:24:20.888]  It's not bad like a basketball game, but it is mentally ill and sick to buy into this manufactured hype and to have government officials that should be working for the people sitting there in these disgusting media spectacles worshipping somebody.
[01:24:20.888 --> 01:24:25.311]  Our role models, our icons, the people that our children look up to.
[01:24:26.292 --> 01:24:26.732]  We're clowns!
[01:24:48.203 --> 01:24:50.584]  They've taken our heroes and our role models away.
[01:24:50.584 --> 01:24:56.925]  Ladies and gentlemen, you have been warned and this whole LeBron James decision means absolutely nothing.
[01:24:56.925 --> 01:25:03.207]  This obsession with petty issues of little or no significance is the modern version of bread and circus.
[01:25:03.207 --> 01:25:09.968]  It is the opiate of the masses and it's why we are dumbed down slaves with no future if we don't wake up.
[01:25:09.968 --> 01:25:10.689]  You have been warned.
[01:25:19.668 --> 01:25:24.552]  We are back live, and that is the video that I put together last night with Aaron Dykes.
[01:25:24.552 --> 01:25:26.854]  He does such incredible work.
[01:25:26.854 --> 01:25:34.640]  We commend him for putting that video together last night, and it's up on the Drudge Report and InfoWars.com.
[01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:42.606]  The article written by Aaron Dykes that accompanies it is titled, As the United States Collapses, Media Worships LeBron James.
[01:25:42.606 --> 01:25:45.308]  And it gives me a lot of satisfaction
[01:25:47.011 --> 01:25:56.139]  To be able to get the word out about how this bread and circus distraction is basically cancer to this nation.
[01:25:56.139 --> 01:26:13.394]  I mean, not only do we have the looming war with Iran, the dollar being devalued and the UN calling for it to lose its World Reserve currency status, not only do we have new banker bailouts on the horizon and the border collapsing and Obama treacherously
[01:26:14.535 --> 01:26:14.735]  Sue
[01:26:32.577 --> 01:26:32.998]  We're good to go.
[01:26:46.067 --> 01:26:57.911]  The entire country's mainstream news media, not the entire population, but large portions of it, large dumbed down groups, completely obsessed over LeBron James, a basketball player.
[01:26:57.911 --> 01:27:03.794]  And you've got them begging him and pleading him not to leave and saying, our ego is tied up in you.
[01:27:03.794 --> 01:27:05.174]  You can't go.
[01:27:05.174 --> 01:27:07.155]  You can't leave.
[01:27:07.155 --> 01:27:09.016]  And then he leaves.
[01:27:09.016 --> 01:27:10.036]  It's just sickening.
[01:27:10.036 --> 01:27:15.198]  And then I saw the owner of the team
[01:27:18.769 --> 01:27:28.774]  Criticizing him in the news and talking about how treacherous and horrible and despicable his decision was.
[01:27:28.774 --> 01:27:30.836]  It's a money-making operation.
[01:27:30.836 --> 01:27:32.516]  There's no morals involved in this.
[01:27:32.516 --> 01:27:39.400]  I mean, the media has implied that entertainment is the highest form of patriotism.
[01:27:39.400 --> 01:27:42.502]  That it's the only thing that matters in a society.
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:59.079]  How do we get our young people to think that George Washington is their hero, or Martin Luther King for that matter, who did stand up for civil rights for people, or Mahatma Gandhi, or our veterans?
[01:28:02.333 --> 01:28:15.158]  Or every few months I read about a fireman or an emergency rescue worker who dies going into a house to save children, or who gets badly burned, or someone who drowns trying to save people from a overflowing river.
[01:28:15.158 --> 01:28:16.599]  I mean, those are heroes.
[01:28:16.599 --> 01:28:22.001]  Those are people we should model ourselves after, not LeBron James.
[01:28:22.001 --> 01:28:29.084]  I mean, the way they built up Obama as this messianic leader, the way they built up Bush as someone we should admire, some political operative.
[01:28:29.804 --> 01:28:32.906]  We've got to change who our role models are.
[01:28:32.906 --> 01:28:38.309]  We've got to start realizing that what's important is what people stand up for.
[01:28:38.309 --> 01:28:49.376]  Heroes are individuals who, despite the fact that the media demonizes them, stand up for the Second Amendment, and stand up for the Constitution, and stand up for this country's sovereignty.
[01:28:52.469 --> 01:29:07.536]  That's why I admire celebrities who take stances that are politically incorrect, knowing they're going to be attacked by the media, knowing they're not going to be promoted by the media, because they understand that their celebrity needs to be used for something good.
[01:29:07.536 --> 01:29:16.061]  I mean, I don't agree with a lot of things that Sean Penn has done, but I did have a chance to meet him in Denver a few years ago, and I admire him for trying to go and help people in Haiti.
[01:29:17.384 --> 01:29:23.036]  That's why I admire the things that Ted Nugent does, because he stands up for property rights and the Second Amendment.
[01:29:23.922 --> 01:29:29.686]  I mean that's the type of information that needs to be gotten out to the public.
[01:29:29.686 --> 01:29:33.849]  This is the type of information that people need to be made aware of.
[01:29:33.849 --> 01:29:37.731]  We're going to come back and continue with the news and a lot more.
[01:29:37.731 --> 01:29:41.654]  We have a lot of informative guests coming up in the balance of the broadcast.
[01:29:41.654 --> 01:29:44.136]  We have two and a half hours left straight ahead.
[01:29:44.136 --> 01:29:48.379]  InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are the websites.
[01:29:48.379 --> 01:29:48.779]  Stay with us.
[01:29:50.919 --> 01:29:54.862]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.862 --> 01:30:00.186]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.186 --> 01:30:01.867]  Listen up folks, this is important.

[01:32:01.428 --> 01:32:05.389]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:05.389 --> 01:32:14.250]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:32:14.250 --> 01:32:18.891]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:32:18.891 --> 01:32:29.693]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:32:30.333 --> 01:32:39.862]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.

[01:33:09.142 --> 01:33:11.983]  Can't wait to talk to him about a host of issues.
[01:33:11.983 --> 01:33:19.326]  But first off, don't forget that we are supported not by these big global corporations, or the New World Order, or the socialists.
[01:33:19.326 --> 01:33:21.347]  We're supported by you, the listeners.
[01:33:21.347 --> 01:33:26.689]  The news websites, Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, the syndicated radio broadcasts, the films I make.
[01:33:27.529 --> 01:33:31.051]  And plus, these videos are what are waking this country up.
[01:33:31.051 --> 01:33:33.452]  All available at InfoWars.com.
[01:33:33.452 --> 01:33:35.473]  The Obama deception.
[01:33:35.473 --> 01:33:37.154]  Endgame blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:33:37.154 --> 01:33:38.154]  The secret of Oz.
[01:33:38.154 --> 01:33:40.335]  Exposing the private Federal Reserve System.
[01:33:40.335 --> 01:33:43.837]  Don't tread on me with Sheriff Richard Mack and how we're going to take our states back.
[01:33:44.677 --> 01:33:47.660]  Key information that every sheriff needs to see.
[01:33:47.660 --> 01:33:49.882]  Invisible Empire, a new order to find.
[01:33:49.882 --> 01:33:54.265]  It's all available at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.

[01:33:56.707 --> 01:33:57.628]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[01:34:04.494 --> 01:34:07.236]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, we are joined by Ted Nugent.
[01:34:07.236 --> 01:34:09.438]  I don't need to really introduce him.
[01:34:09.438 --> 01:34:11.359]  Everybody knows who Ted Nugent is.
[01:34:11.359 --> 01:34:18.644]  But his latest book was a number one New York Times bestseller, Ted Nugent, Red, White, and Blue.
[01:34:18.644 --> 01:34:23.567]  And we really appreciate him joining us, The Nugent Manifesto.
[01:34:23.567 --> 01:34:25.649]  And he's also on tour right now.
[01:34:25.649 --> 01:34:29.151]  The website is tednugent.com.
[01:34:29.151 --> 01:34:31.213]  And, Ted, it is great to have you here with us.
[01:34:31.676 --> 01:34:32.838]  Yeah, back at you, Alex.
[01:34:32.838 --> 01:34:41.007]  Greetings from the Nugent family and certainly the band and my crew and all my guides and outfitters and all my hunting and fishing and trapping and NRA blood brothers out there.
[01:34:41.007 --> 01:34:47.976]  We bring you a salute for staying true to logic, common sense, self-evident truth, and the American way.
[01:34:47.976 --> 01:34:49.277]  You're doing God's work, man.
[01:34:49.277 --> 01:34:49.578]  Thank you.
[01:34:49.818 --> 01:34:50.619]  Well, thank you, Ted.
[01:34:50.619 --> 01:35:05.696]  Before we get into all the things that are happening with Barry Sotero, aka Barack Obama, the Arizona situation, before we get into all of that, the oil spill, you name it, tell us about the book that, of course, is a number one New York Times bestseller, now coming out in paperback.
[01:35:06.016 --> 01:35:16.279]  Well, I wrote Ted White and Blue, the Newton Manifesto, a few years ago as an ongoing attempt, and a successful one on my part, to raise hell.
[01:35:16.279 --> 01:35:21.440]  To actually have the audacity to participate in this sacred experiment of self-government.
[01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:32.003]  I believe, Alex, that what is in the pages of Ted White and Blue, the Newton Manifesto, or certainly what you do on the radio every day, and what more and more people are waking up to the reality of, is that in order to earn
[01:35:32.703 --> 01:35:47.171]  Your Americanism, you have to actually participate and be engaged in this very responsible and very critical duty of a self-experimented self-government.
[01:35:47.171 --> 01:35:56.677]  I realized way back in the 60s when I was attacked on hippie rock and roll radio for not doing their drugs and not drooling and puking like all the other zombie dips out there.
[01:35:57.177 --> 01:36:08.102]  And they would attack me for carrying a gun and believing in self-defense and hunting and fishing and trapping and all these perfect environmental positives that the Newton family celebrates.
[01:36:08.102 --> 01:36:13.864]  Then I realized that, boy, the left are brain dead!
[01:36:14.384 --> 01:36:15.484]  They're dangerous.
[01:36:15.484 --> 01:36:20.546]  They literally celebrate the bad and the evil while I try to maximize the good.
[01:36:20.546 --> 01:36:26.188]  So I started maximizing the good in an attempt to destroy the bad and the ugly.
[01:36:26.188 --> 01:36:30.930]  And it's been very successful because I've got to tell you, Alex, I'm a gregarious guy.
[01:36:30.930 --> 01:36:31.890]  I travel this country.
[01:36:31.890 --> 01:36:33.971]  We have an incredible tour right now.
[01:36:33.971 --> 01:36:37.232]  Fifty years later, it's called Trample the Weak, Hurdle the Dead.
[01:36:37.232 --> 01:36:39.613]  I've got the greatest band in the world.
[01:36:39.613 --> 01:36:41.934]  We're selling out every night all these years later.
[01:36:43.354 --> 01:37:00.039]  The positive energy, the goodwill, the decency, the logic that Alex Jones represents, the logic that is in Ted White and Blue, the Nugent Manifesto, and my weekly articles on humanevents.com and washingtontimes.com, that I'm not the weirdo.
[01:37:00.039 --> 01:37:01.979]  The left are the weirdo.
[01:37:01.979 --> 01:37:06.961]  History has proven that everything Barack Obama stands for and is implementing
[01:37:07.601 --> 01:37:08.102]  I don't
[01:37:26.715 --> 01:37:27.656]  We're good to go.
[01:37:46.923 --> 01:37:56.845]  Well, expanding on that, liberty and freedom and building our republic and saving it from the jaws of collectivism and globalism, this is not a spectator sport.
[01:37:56.845 --> 01:38:04.107]  And that's what's so good about you, Ted, is I know you've been persecuted, but it didn't make you cry and go into the shadows.
[01:38:04.107 --> 01:38:06.808]  It didn't make you sell out to these people.
[01:38:06.808 --> 01:38:15.390]  You stood up to them and became even more successful despite the fact in the last three decades that you didn't submit to their propaganda and brainwashing.
[01:38:15.390 --> 01:38:16.270]  And as you said,
[01:38:16.690 --> 01:38:22.394]  You have now succeeded doing it your way as a true American, whereas they have failed.
[01:38:22.394 --> 01:38:23.495]  You are popular.
[01:38:23.495 --> 01:38:26.598]  Your message is stronger now, not weaker.
[01:38:26.598 --> 01:38:28.999]  Their message is weakening by the day.
[01:38:28.999 --> 01:38:36.005]  They are bleeding out like, you know, some wildcat that Ted Nugent's just blasted.
[01:38:36.405 --> 01:38:47.844]  Well, you know, for years I've been attacked as being an extremist and a radical and out of control, and to all those accusations I would like to plead alive on the Alex Jones Radio Show, you're damn right!
[01:38:49.119 --> 01:38:50.821]  You're damn right I'm an extremist.
[01:38:50.821 --> 01:38:52.522]  I'm extremely free.
[01:38:52.522 --> 01:38:54.364]  I'm not kind of free.
[01:38:54.364 --> 01:38:57.407]  I don't kind of have individual rights.
[01:38:57.407 --> 01:39:09.458]  Ruth Bader Ginsburg, John Paul Stevens, Sonia Sotomayor, you racist punk, Stephen Breyer, these subhuman anti-American punks.
[01:39:10.459 --> 01:39:16.243]  In black robes in the Supreme Court of the United States, who actually wrote, Alex, help me through this.
[01:39:16.243 --> 01:39:20.987]  If I have an aneurysm on your radio show, send someone to resuscitate me.
[01:39:20.987 --> 01:39:30.414]  Because we have four Americans, and I'm being generous with the term, who have actually written a Supreme Court statement.
[01:39:31.184 --> 01:39:36.426]  That American citizens have no fundamental right to self-defense.
[01:39:36.426 --> 01:39:39.567]  They didn't even say Second Amendment or keep and bear arms.
[01:39:39.567 --> 01:39:50.652]  These four subhuman Supreme Court punks don't believe that American citizens have a basic right to self-defense.
[01:39:50.652 --> 01:39:52.313]  I'm a creative guy, Alex.
[01:39:52.313 --> 01:39:53.913]  I'm an imaginative guy.
[01:39:53.913 --> 01:39:58.795]  I not only wrote Wang Dang Sweet Poon Tang, I mean it every night when I sing it.
[01:39:58.795 --> 01:40:00.316]  But my creative juices
[01:40:01.566 --> 01:40:03.387]  I recommend they dial 1-800-EAT-ME.
[01:40:22.448 --> 01:40:26.310]  Ted Nugent, I mean, this really is an act of treason, of sedition.
[01:40:26.310 --> 01:40:27.331]  It's so dangerous.
[01:40:27.331 --> 01:40:37.716]  I mean, Obama is now going to probably get a couple more justices in, and instead of them ruling that we have a limited Second Amendment, which is bad enough, they're going to rule we have no right.
[01:40:37.716 --> 01:40:43.699]  And we know Attorney General Holder, in cases, has argued that he believes in the UN's policy
[01:40:44.199 --> 01:40:44.399]  I don't
[01:41:01.658 --> 01:41:04.500]  Hitler, Mao Zedong rolled into one.
[01:41:04.500 --> 01:41:07.663]  They know that political power goes out of the barrel of the gun.
[01:41:07.663 --> 01:41:13.047]  They know that we will be we the people as long as we're armed as that ultimate check against tyranny.
[01:41:13.047 --> 01:41:17.270]  And that's why they hunger and lust after our precious guns.
[01:41:17.270 --> 01:41:30.941]  And I will remind them that in 1775 in Lexington and Concord, the war was kicked off that led to 1776 and the Declaration of Independence and July 4th and mom and apple pie and everything good about this country.
[01:41:31.701 --> 01:41:42.349]  When the British came to take the guns and the ammo, and I remind them again that the day they try to actually say we can't own our guns is the day they're in a lot of trouble.
[01:41:42.349 --> 01:41:44.671]  They are a bunch of wannabe Joe Stalins.
[01:41:44.671 --> 01:41:46.792]  They are criminals!
[01:41:46.792 --> 01:41:48.433]  I couldn't have said it better myself, Alex.
[01:41:48.433 --> 01:41:49.674]  God bless you for that.
[01:41:49.674 --> 01:41:57.440]  That kind of inescapable historical evidence that you just articulated with the proper passion.
[01:41:57.440 --> 01:41:59.041]  Alex, feel good today in 2010.
[01:42:00.811 --> 01:42:22.782]  That spirit, that most critical and important American genetic trait of defiance, is alive and well and growing out of the cesspool of apathy that allowed American citizens to bend over to the unforgivable degree to allow the Mao Tse-Tung fan club into the White House.
[01:42:22.782 --> 01:42:27.264]  And a lot of people out there are like, ah, Alex Jones and Ted Nutter, it's hyperbole.
[01:42:27.264 --> 01:42:29.085]  Six of his R's have praised Mao!
[01:42:30.205 --> 01:42:40.868]  Every word you say, every word I wrote in Ted White and Blue, the Nugent Manifesto, my weekly columns at HumanEvents.com and WashingtonTimes.com.
[01:42:40.868 --> 01:42:43.469]  You've got to connect with my website, TedNugent.com.
[01:42:43.469 --> 01:42:48.090]  I've got thousands of articles I've written that no one can argue with.
[01:42:48.090 --> 01:42:50.050]  In fact, here's the beauty of it, Alex.
[01:42:50.050 --> 01:42:55.252]  Here's what my critics do when they attack me, even on those websites, those conservative websites.
[01:42:55.772 --> 01:43:01.740]  They constantly repeat the Saul Alinsky, Cloward Piven, Modis Operandi.
[01:43:01.740 --> 01:43:07.307]  Everywhere I write an article, this is so beautiful I can hardly stand myself.
[01:43:07.307 --> 01:43:11.293]  I'm more proud of what I'm about to tell you, Alex, than anything in my life.
[01:43:12.242 --> 01:43:20.133]  Every time I stand up and write an article or speak or do interviews, the left goes berserk and they call me a draft dodger.
[01:43:20.133 --> 01:43:21.996]  I did not dodge the draft.
[01:43:21.996 --> 01:43:23.678]  I had a one-way deferment.
[01:43:23.678 --> 01:43:27.664]  They call me a child molester and a sex offender.
[01:43:28.732 --> 01:43:44.753]  I've never been charged with or convicted of any of those evil accusations, but based on the Saul Alinsky playbook that Hillary Clinton did her theses in college on, they need to attack with the most vicious and hateful lies they can.
[01:43:46.889 --> 01:43:47.869]  Ted, you should be proud.
[01:43:47.869 --> 01:43:49.670]  That's a badge of honor.
[01:43:49.670 --> 01:43:56.512]  Well, listen, I mean, they've had national TV and Chris Matthews claim that I'm calling for violence when I've never called for violence.
[01:43:56.512 --> 01:44:00.033]  I've said we have a right to defend ourselves against criminals.
[01:44:00.033 --> 01:44:01.673]  I mean, it's insane how much they lie.
[01:44:01.673 --> 01:44:06.095]  But but shifting gears into another area that follows that line, I want to read you a quote here.
[01:44:07.395 --> 01:44:09.376]  This is the definition of high treason.
[01:44:09.376 --> 01:44:20.061]  Participating in a war against one's country, attempting to overthrow its government, spying on its military, its diplomats, or its secret services for a hostile foreign power.
[01:44:20.061 --> 01:44:22.002]  Now, what is it?
[01:44:22.722 --> 01:44:27.146]  By definition, to have Obama violate the 9th, 10th, and 11th Amendment.
[01:44:27.146 --> 01:44:39.296]  The 11th Amendment says the federal government cannot sue a state or an individual on behalf of a foreign power or state, and cannot sue an individual citizen on behalf of a foreign power, state, or individual.
[01:44:39.296 --> 01:44:41.577]  So that's the 11th, not just the 10th Amendment.
[01:44:41.577 --> 01:44:50.124]  All the scholars have looked at it and said that all the Arizona law does is, it's a copy of the federal law, and it says if we have first contact with a drunk driving illegal alien,
[01:44:51.065 --> 01:44:55.468]  Or if we come to a crime scene and they're an illegal alien with no ID, we're gonna take him to jail.
[01:44:55.468 --> 01:44:57.950]  So, it's okay to throw the book at citizens.
[01:44:57.950 --> 01:45:02.933]  In Colorado, two days ago, a 82-year-old veteran was being robbed at his house.
[01:45:02.933 --> 01:45:05.895]  They were stealing his vehicle, his trailer.
[01:45:05.895 --> 01:45:06.856]  They tried to run over him.
[01:45:06.856 --> 01:45:08.057]  He shot one of the illegals.
[01:45:08.057 --> 01:45:09.358]  The illegal pled guilty.
[01:45:09.358 --> 01:45:16.722]  The police released the wounded illegal and his cohort, and they're charging him with murder, and he's facing life in prison.
[01:45:16.722 --> 01:45:16.883]  So,
[01:45:18.223 --> 01:45:20.365]  The border has collapsed.
[01:45:20.365 --> 01:45:22.046]  Sheriffs are begging for help.
[01:45:22.046 --> 01:45:25.889]  80 plus miles into Arizona is literally run by illegals.
[01:45:25.889 --> 01:45:30.452]  There's signs up saying don't drive down this road, don't go on this national park, don't go on the state park.
[01:45:30.452 --> 01:45:39.578]  Arizona's begging for help and Obama sends the feds in to sue them to block the state trying to restore law and order that is lawful and it's worse.
[01:45:39.578 --> 01:45:45.322]  Senator Kyle meets with Obama and Obama says I want that crisis to get worse, to force through amnesty.
[01:45:45.322 --> 01:45:47.443]  If that isn't high treason Ted Nugent, what is it?
[01:45:47.763 --> 01:45:59.993]  Well, by all common sense and logic, the President of the United States and most of his czars, many of his administration, are guilty of all the crimes you just outlined.
[01:45:59.993 --> 01:46:08.740]  Anybody who doesn't get that is either brain dead or have their heads so far up their asses not to have seen daylight that last century.
[01:46:08.740 --> 01:46:15.545]  I believe that the good Governor Brewer is doing God's work in Arizona.
[01:46:16.229 --> 01:46:27.030]  I believe that the good citizens of Arizona... I was down there when the good rancher was murdered by illegal invaders, and that our government did nothing.
[01:46:27.589 --> 01:46:28.970]  I'm on tour right now.
[01:46:28.970 --> 01:46:34.293]  I've already done like 20-some cities, and I've got another 40 to go.
[01:46:46.600 --> 01:46:53.983]  And I communicate with the heroes of law enforcement, our border patrol agents, all arms of the U.S.
[01:46:53.983 --> 01:46:54.924]  military.
[01:46:54.924 --> 01:47:03.227]  At every concert, we have a little pow-wow, we drink a little ginger ale, and eat a little guacamole backstage every night, and we talk about the important issues.
[01:47:04.211 --> 01:47:10.975]  And I believe that there is a growing activism, there's a growing re-engagement of we the people.
[01:47:10.975 --> 01:47:16.578]  We are once again identifying the self-evident truth that is articulated and guaranteed in the U.S.
[01:47:16.578 --> 01:47:20.940]  Constitution, the Bill of Rights, certainly that America is based on the Ten Commandments and the Golden Rule.
[01:47:21.400 --> 01:47:21.700]  Yes, sir.
[01:47:38.937 --> 01:47:56.354]  And a growing enlightenment and communication amongst families at the workplace, at church, at school, where we're starting to identify that the President hates America, that the President hates the American Dream, that the President of the United States is waging war
[01:47:58.172 --> 01:48:02.075]  On the American Dream, Entrepreneurialism, and Excellence.
[01:48:02.075 --> 01:48:24.970]  He literally is implementing policies that are clear and present danger, that are acts of treason, and I believe that come November, like we did up in Massachusetts in a few other midterm elections recently, the incumbents and the Fedzilla-crats, the corruption, the entrenched abuse of power that is rampant in our government today, is going to get a rude awakening.
[01:48:26.571 --> 01:48:30.692]  I believe that we're going to take this country back in a non-violent way.
[01:48:30.692 --> 01:48:41.855]  I believe that the very fact that there are more guns per capita in the United States, more ARs, more ammo, than any society in recorded history, Alex.
[01:48:41.855 --> 01:48:43.795]  The statistics are irrefutable.
[01:48:43.795 --> 01:48:46.756]  That that is an entrenchment statement.
[01:48:46.756 --> 01:48:49.577]  Don't tread on me.
[01:48:49.577 --> 01:48:50.857]  You better hope.
[01:48:52.057 --> 01:48:56.420]  We take this country back non-violently, because we can and we will.
[01:48:56.420 --> 01:49:01.162]  But the alternative will accomplish the same thing.
[01:49:01.162 --> 01:49:02.323]  Well, the system knows that.
[01:49:02.323 --> 01:49:05.445]  Law enforcement sent us the MIAC and Homeland Security reports.
[01:49:05.445 --> 01:49:07.786]  We broke that back in January of last year.
[01:49:07.786 --> 01:49:10.828]  And they're not worried about people wearing turbans in caves.
[01:49:10.828 --> 01:49:12.629]  That's what they sell the public on.
[01:49:12.629 --> 01:49:17.092]  The entire federal apparatus under Lord Obama
[01:49:17.632 --> 01:49:27.437]  is for returning veterans, gun owners, conservatives, people like Ron Paul, people even like the Libertarian presidential candidate that's pretty much milquetoast, Bob Barr.
[01:49:27.437 --> 01:49:33.500]  They're saying if somebody has an American flag or get us out of the UN sticker on their car, that they want to kill cops.
[01:49:33.500 --> 01:49:44.205]  I mean, this really shows the treason that basically those reports, if you boil them down, say that if you've got a portrait of John Wayne or Ted Nugent hanging in your house, you're a terrorist.
[01:49:44.568 --> 01:49:45.829]  Yeah, it's phenomenal.
[01:49:45.829 --> 01:50:08.264]  If you listen to the President and his Attorney General, his Secretary of Treasury, the entire administration, if you listen to 9 out of 10 bureaucrats out there right now, you literally are hearing, without flinching, their hatred for America, their support for illegal invaders,
[01:50:09.159 --> 01:50:16.364]  They're intentional dismantling of this American dream, this American experiment in self-government.
[01:50:16.364 --> 01:50:23.490]  So again, the Tea Party is but the tip of a cultural war spear that is being sharpened as we speak, Alex.
[01:50:23.490 --> 01:50:27.052]  Again, I think the prognosis is better than it was a few years ago.
[01:50:27.052 --> 01:50:31.015]  The line drawn in the sand has never been more obvious and more defined.
[01:50:31.015 --> 01:50:35.599]  I believe that more and more Americans are waking up, that we have it, we the people,
[01:50:36.159 --> 01:50:37.680]  Are the cause of all this.
[01:50:37.680 --> 01:51:01.858]  We let the rats into our house for the last 50 years, but it took a really stinky, communist, toxic rat like Barack Hussein Obama and his Mao Zedong fan club to finally wake up Americans that this man, this community organizer-in-chief hates.
[01:51:02.828 --> 01:51:10.893]  America, and he would be just tickled pink if America turned into his Indonesian dream.
[01:51:10.893 --> 01:51:12.334]  But we the people are waking up.
[01:51:12.334 --> 01:51:17.697]  The Tea Party is the tip of the iceberg, and I believe that we're going to vote these bastards out ASAP.
[01:51:17.697 --> 01:51:22.820]  I believe that the next few years' elections are going to be a shocking wake-up call.
[01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:29.085]  To these abuse of power monsters that trickle down from the President of the United States.
[01:51:29.085 --> 01:51:31.407]  So, we do have to turn up the heat.
[01:51:31.407 --> 01:51:43.757]  Anybody right now, Alex, in America, who's not in constant communication with their elected officials, their senator, their congressman, their mayor, their government, their governor, saying, stop the tax and burn!
[01:51:43.757 --> 01:51:50.343]  Stop with this insanity of forbidding entrepreneurs from digging for the energy that we the people need!
[01:51:57.786 --> 01:52:04.712]  Well, I mean, expanding on that, of all the oil companies, and I'm pro-energy, pro-cheap energy, and I am pro-drill, baby, drill.
[01:52:17.563 --> 01:52:21.404]  BP are the one oil company that pushed the carbon tax.
[01:52:21.404 --> 01:52:23.485]  They're one of the biggest contributors to Obama.
[01:52:23.485 --> 01:52:41.391]  They met with Ken Lay of Enron and Al Gore back in 1995 to come up with the carbon trading scheme and I'm very suspicious, Ted, of this whole thing and the way Obama has been blocking the relief effort and not letting those skimmer ships and other things come in and blocking the states from building berms.
[01:52:41.391 --> 01:52:45.852]  I think he wants this to be as bad as possible and he now admits he wants to get a carbon tax with it.
[01:52:46.152 --> 01:52:55.252]  Well, I think your suspicions are well-founded, and I think that's... Again, Alex, the job of an American citizen is to remain suspicious.
[01:52:55.953 --> 01:53:03.778]  To turn up the heat and the pressure and the probing and the scrutiny of our elected officials and our government constantly.
[01:53:03.778 --> 01:53:11.602]  So I join you in that suspicion, but I was stating a statistic regarding BP's, you know, spill rate and their so-called accident rate.
[01:53:11.602 --> 01:53:14.464]  I'm still not sure whether it was an accident or negligence.
[01:53:14.464 --> 01:53:18.827]  I gotta tell you, you know, I've never been attacked in my home, but I got a gun in every corner.
[01:53:18.827 --> 01:53:20.988]  I've never had a fire in my house, but I've got a...
[01:53:21.528 --> 01:53:26.793]  Well, regardless, the rest of the industry shouldn't be punished for BP's bad record.
[01:53:26.793 --> 01:53:28.054]  And they do have the worst record.
[01:53:28.054 --> 01:53:28.614]  Exactly.
[01:53:28.614 --> 01:53:30.035]  I mean, that's communism.
[01:53:30.035 --> 01:53:32.557]  They won't be punished.
[01:53:32.557 --> 01:53:33.758]  We will be.
[01:53:33.758 --> 01:53:34.319]  Exactly.
[01:53:34.319 --> 01:53:38.042]  So, I mean, look, if my neighbor commits a crime, I don't go to jail with him.
[01:53:38.042 --> 01:53:38.843]  That's communism.
[01:53:40.131 --> 01:53:44.756]  Welcome to the Marxist fan club of Barack Hussein Obama.
[01:53:44.756 --> 01:53:54.647]  God bless you, Alex, for raising the hell that you're raising, and I know your listeners are passionate, and God bless you being right here in the epicenter of the greatest republic in the nation.
[01:53:54.647 --> 01:53:59.012]  I mean, Texas isn't perfect, but boy, at least my governor shoots coyotes.
[01:54:02.778 --> 01:54:04.059]  Ted Nugent, we're almost out of time.
[01:54:04.059 --> 01:54:07.502]  We've only got about four minutes left with you, and then you've got to go jump on a plane.
[01:54:07.502 --> 01:54:12.587]  But a few other questions that I wanted to raise with Ted Nugent while he's with us, tednugent.com.
[01:54:12.587 --> 01:54:16.270]  Our site, of course, is infowars.com.
[01:54:16.270 --> 01:54:21.194]  What is your overall view on the government takeover of healthcare?
[01:54:21.194 --> 01:54:23.596]  Now we're finding out it doesn't cover the uninsured.
[01:54:23.596 --> 01:54:26.018]  Now we find out the insurance companies wrote it.
[01:54:26.018 --> 01:54:28.600]  Now we find out the big offshore banks were involved.
[01:54:28.600 --> 01:54:30.582]  Now we find out it's just another banker bailout.
[01:54:31.095 --> 01:54:34.239]  Well, and again, God bless guys like Glenn Beck.
[01:54:34.239 --> 01:54:39.406]  I've never seen anybody spotlight more cockroaches than Alex Jones and Glenn Beck.
[01:54:39.406 --> 01:54:45.494]  And he's bringing forth these videos and showing the statements, the unflinching statements.
[01:54:46.095 --> 01:55:07.750]  By the Barack Obama cronies out there who have articulated that the takeover of the healthcare industry is merely one of their baby steps, although it could be a giant step, much like cap and trade, and the taking over of General Motors, and the Fedzilla intrusion into private business across this country.
[01:55:07.750 --> 01:55:10.232]  That's all part of his Marxist agenda.
[01:55:10.232 --> 01:55:14.075]  You really examine the voting record of Barack Obama,
[01:55:14.355 --> 01:55:24.646]  Who is basically a clueless rookie whose only credentials is a community organizer, which pretty much any hippie could do.
[01:55:24.646 --> 01:55:30.051]  The president's agenda is czar's agenda, his administration's agenda.
[01:55:30.832 --> 01:55:40.255]  Van Jones was thrown out, but Alex, we all know that everybody around the president is a Van Jones.
[01:55:40.255 --> 01:55:47.557]  And they're putting on their shirt and tie, and they're backing down their extremist revolutionary rhetoric so that they can be more palatable.
[01:55:48.377 --> 01:55:55.741]  Well, it's now come out that John P. Holdren wrote that he wants, just a few years ago, the complete transfer of our wealth globally.
[01:55:55.741 --> 01:55:57.522]  I mean, these guys are very dangerous.
[01:55:57.522 --> 01:55:59.723]  But my last question for Ted Nugent is this.
[01:55:59.723 --> 01:56:02.564]  Ted, everybody I talk to gets the same intel.
[01:56:02.564 --> 01:56:08.286]  And we see not just Democrats being voted out, but pro-establishment Republicans in every primary.
[01:56:08.286 --> 01:56:11.708]  So it's the incumbent establishment people that are being voted out.
[01:56:11.708 --> 01:56:13.369]  This is a political realignment
[01:56:13.929 --> 01:56:14.169]  Amen!
[01:56:28.946 --> 01:56:58.249]  I'm 62 years old this year, Alex, and I, you're correct, I'm seeing a turbocharged awakening across this country, and most relievingly from the heroes of law enforcement and military, where I believe, and this is the deciding factor, Alex, and this is a great point to celebrate, that if the, there's a military term, and I'll give you the first two syllables on your show, it's a cluster, it's a cluster-whack, so to speak, that when and if
[01:56:59.341 --> 01:57:19.193]  These Mao Zedong fan clubbers in the White House and the Czars and the administration of Barack Hussein Obama, if they dare continue down the road they're going, and if all hell breaks loose, I am convinced that the majority of law enforcement and the majority of military personnel
[01:57:19.873 --> 01:57:22.756]  We'll be on the side of we, the people.
[01:57:22.756 --> 01:57:32.726]  If that doesn't tell you something, that they voluntarily offer that testimony everywhere I go, that's an indicator that brings me great hope.
[01:57:32.726 --> 01:57:37.531]  Because I believe that we're going to take back this country in a non-violent, voting way.
[01:57:37.531 --> 01:57:39.333]  It's going to be a huge takeover.
[01:57:39.333 --> 01:57:42.657]  You're right, the incumbents, they're all guilty to some degree.
[01:57:43.597 --> 01:57:47.440]  We need to watch and make sure that we keep the good guys in there.
[01:57:47.440 --> 01:57:51.883]  We got some good guys like Mike Cox and Mike Rogers in Michigan.
[01:57:51.883 --> 01:57:56.286]  We got good guys here in Texas like Governor Rick Perry and some of the Republicans.
[01:57:56.286 --> 01:58:01.950]  There's actually a few Democrats out there that still pretend they're not on the same camp as Nancy Pelosi.
[01:58:01.950 --> 01:58:03.231]  We wish them well.
[01:58:03.231 --> 01:58:05.173]  But we the people are in charge.
[01:58:05.173 --> 01:58:08.635]  And if we continue with the apathy, America's going to hell.
[01:58:08.635 --> 01:58:10.957]  If we re-engage and function as we the people,
[01:58:11.537 --> 01:58:15.159]  Alright, Ted Nugent, thank you so much for the time.
[01:58:15.159 --> 01:58:15.740]  He's on tour.

[01:59:47.303 --> 01:59:53.529]  This information is too important to wait.
[01:59:53.529 --> 01:59:55.932]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:55.932 --> 01:59:58.695]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.598 --> 02:00:10.420]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.420 --> 02:00:12.021]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.021 --> 02:00:13.562]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.562 --> 02:00:17.764]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.764 --> 02:00:23.786]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.786 --> 02:00:28.649]  We got Bob Chapman with us for the next hour, a regular guest every Friday.
[02:00:29.890 --> 02:00:33.074]  We're gonna open the phones up in this hour and the next.
[02:00:33.074 --> 02:00:36.618]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[02:00:36.618 --> 02:00:47.189]  I'm gonna get the latest financial developments from our in-house expert Bob Chapman on the economy and then I'm gonna get his take on LeBron James and how we're obsessed with...
[02:00:48.010 --> 02:00:54.713]  Petty sports icons where he sees the dollar going with these UN announcements of how we should scrap it.
[02:00:54.713 --> 02:00:57.855]  We're going to get into so many important issues.
[02:00:57.855 --> 02:01:05.298]  Also, in the last hour, we've got a Arizona sheriff popping in who's got Mexican mafia hits out on him.
[02:01:05.298 --> 02:01:06.639]  The mechanics have been turned loose.
[02:01:06.639 --> 02:01:12.742]  And, folks, it's not a joke when MS-13, the Mexican mafia, have killed over 2,000 police just the last year.
[02:01:13.842 --> 02:01:17.285]  24,000 dead now in the last two years in Mexico.
[02:01:17.285 --> 02:01:18.446]  Thousands dead on the U.S.
[02:01:18.446 --> 02:01:19.447]  side.
[02:01:19.447 --> 02:01:28.654]  The media was actually, the liberal fake media, the establishment media, was claiming that this is, that that's just, when they issue a hit, it's just a joke.
[02:01:28.654 --> 02:01:31.537]  And I wonder how they're going to spend dead sheriffs.
[02:01:31.537 --> 02:01:34.239]  They'll probably say they're Al-Qaeda or something, knowing the media.
[02:01:34.239 --> 02:01:36.841]  Well, the sheriff, he was evil.
[02:01:36.841 --> 02:01:38.122]  The Mexican mafia is good.
[02:01:38.122 --> 02:01:39.723]  They're killing everybody in Mexico.
[02:01:41.556 --> 02:01:43.922]  So that's all coming up in the last hour.
[02:01:43.922 --> 02:01:45.666]  And I've got other news here.
[02:01:45.666 --> 02:01:50.017]  They're trying to move now towards grocery stores where you face scan, thumbprint.
[02:01:51.082 --> 02:01:56.827]  biometrically to buy and sell, and we've got a key article out on that up at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:01:56.827 --> 02:02:00.130]  Mark of the Beast rears its head in Pennsylvania.
[02:02:00.130 --> 02:02:01.391]  But I want to give the number out.
[02:02:01.391 --> 02:02:01.591]  It's 1-800-259-9231.
[02:02:01.591 --> 02:02:01.711]  800-259-9231.
[02:02:01.711 --> 02:02:02.272]  Straight ahead.
[02:02:02.272 --> 02:02:04.214]  And we'll be talking, of course, with Bob Chapman.
[02:02:04.214 --> 02:02:05.555]  In fact, going to Bob right now.
[02:02:05.555 --> 02:02:08.337]  Bob, so much happens as we talked to you seven days ago, last Friday.
[02:02:18.946 --> 02:02:26.247]  We've now passed another birthday for our country, and I think that overall we're in a lot of trouble, but people are starting to accelerate their awakening.
[02:02:26.247 --> 02:02:29.288]  We heard the same thing from Ted Nugent.
[02:02:29.288 --> 02:02:35.409]  But on the economy, what do you think are the biggest and most important developments we've seen in the last seven days?
[02:02:35.409 --> 02:02:37.249]  Well, there's a number of them.
[02:02:37.249 --> 02:02:46.911]  I think we looked at Europe first, and a loan was made about a year ago from the European Central Bank to other banks.
[02:02:48.746 --> 02:02:53.668]  It was for about $557 billion.
[02:02:53.668 --> 02:03:03.653]  And instead of reissuing it for a year, what they are doing is reissuing that loan for quarters every three months.
[02:03:03.653 --> 02:03:07.915]  And also there's supplements to that if they need it.
[02:03:07.915 --> 02:03:11.276]  And the total amount is around $664 billion on the new loan line, we'll call it.
[02:03:16.164 --> 02:03:37.368]  And you can go back two and a half to three years here, and the scandal of the misrating and the criminal activity of Wall Street and banking in selling collateralized debt obligations, which are bonds which contain mortgages, 60% of which were dumped in Europe.
[02:03:37.368 --> 02:03:44.849]  And they are nowhere near recovering from that, just like the American institutions have purchased them as well.
[02:03:44.849 --> 02:03:45.189]  And so,
[02:03:46.250 --> 02:03:49.051]  Europe is in very tough shape.
[02:03:49.051 --> 02:03:57.453]  And it's not only the pigs that you hear about, which are the five nations that have fiscal and monetary problems.
[02:03:57.453 --> 02:04:06.155]  It's also the people, the countries, the banks, that bought the bonds, which they should have never bought in the first place.
[02:04:06.155 --> 02:04:10.296]  And of course, countries like Greece and Italy should have never been accepted
[02:04:11.027 --> 02:04:17.629]  That's right, and I think the evolution that you just talked about in the introduction about the special drawing rights and the dumping of the dollar
[02:04:35.036 --> 02:04:36.778]  They think it's time to do that.
[02:04:36.778 --> 02:04:38.159]  When we come back, we'll get into it.
[02:04:38.159 --> 02:04:42.463]  Yeah, I remember you five years ago talking about SDRs would be the global cashless currency.
[02:04:42.463 --> 02:04:44.685]  People said, well, wait a minute, that's a basket of currencies.
[02:04:44.685 --> 02:04:47.928]  But this central group of bankers will set those values.
[02:04:47.928 --> 02:04:50.490]  It'll give them even more power to manipulate.
[02:04:50.490 --> 02:04:50.971]  Stay there.
[02:04:50.971 --> 02:04:54.134]  Bob Chapman, our guest, straight ahead and your phone calls early in the hour.
[02:04:54.134 --> 02:04:58.978]  I promise we're going to get to any questions you've got for Bob or other news items you want to bring up.
[02:04:58.978 --> 02:04:59.498]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:00.419 --> 02:05:04.962]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:05:04.962 --> 02:05:05.883]  Number one.
[02:05:05.883 --> 02:05:09.305]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:05:09.305 --> 02:05:10.166]  Number two.
[02:05:10.166 --> 02:05:15.069]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:05:15.069 --> 02:05:15.810]  It's true.
[02:05:15.810 --> 02:05:20.673]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:20.673 --> 02:05:21.514]  Number three.
[02:05:21.514 --> 02:05:25.096]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:05:25.096 --> 02:05:28.799]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:05:28.999 --> 02:05:29.779]  Number 4.
[02:05:29.779 --> 02:05:32.540]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:05:32.540 --> 02:05:36.222]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:05:36.222 --> 02:05:37.022]  Number 5.
[02:05:37.022 --> 02:05:41.164]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:05:41.164 --> 02:05:46.206]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:05:46.206 --> 02:05:50.387]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:05:50.387 --> 02:05:52.168]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[02:05:58.031 --> 02:06:04.415]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:06:04.415 --> 02:06:10.819]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:06:10.819 --> 02:06:18.203]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[02:06:18.203 --> 02:06:23.086]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[02:06:26.930 --> 02:06:28.192]  People keep asking me, how's business?
[02:06:42.772 --> 02:06:46.655]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[02:06:46.655 --> 02:06:47.816]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091.

[02:06:52.399 --> 02:06:52.799]  Thank you.
[02:06:52.799 --> 02:06:56.741]  You may be arrested and or subject to public policing action.
[02:07:04.167 --> 02:07:05.428]  Tyranny is here.
[02:07:05.428 --> 02:07:09.291]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:07:09.291 --> 02:07:11.593]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:07:11.593 --> 02:07:17.459]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:07:17.459 --> 02:07:23.705]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[02:07:24.125 --> 02:07:30.106]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:07:30.106 --> 02:07:34.267]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[02:07:34.267 --> 02:07:38.568]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:07:38.568 --> 02:07:44.509]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:07:44.509 --> 02:07:48.069]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:07:48.069 --> 02:07:50.030]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:07:50.030 --> 02:07:50.470]  It's here.

[02:08:10.437 --> 02:08:12.038]  You want answers?
[02:08:12.038 --> 02:08:13.579]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:13.579 --> 02:08:17.781]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:17.781 --> 02:08:22.843]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:22.843 --> 02:08:27.065]  I can be in New York State, Oklahoma, Florida, Texas, California.
[02:08:27.065 --> 02:08:28.046]  Doesn't matter where I go.
[02:08:28.046 --> 02:08:31.047]  I can be in foreign countries and people come up to me on the street.
[02:08:31.047 --> 02:08:33.268]  And they say, you woke me up, Alex.
[02:08:33.268 --> 02:08:34.629]  And you showed me a wider world.
[02:08:35.649 --> 02:08:39.771]  All I'm doing is trying to get the blinders off people, then you'll see it for yourselves.
[02:08:39.771 --> 02:08:43.353]  Once you see the Matrix, there's no going back.
[02:08:43.353 --> 02:08:53.338]  And 9 times out of 10, or even more often, I mean, it's almost always, more like 90 times out of 100, or 99 times out of 100, I mean, it's almost always.
[02:08:53.338 --> 02:08:54.899]  Well, you've heard the callers.
[02:08:54.899 --> 02:09:03.724]  You know, I tuned in to you because I saw the Obama deception, or I saw fall of the Republic, or I saw invisible empire in your order to find, or I saw a terror storm.
[02:09:04.892 --> 02:09:15.477]  The films are the biggest weapon we've got, because these films are well produced, they're highly documented, it's riveting, frightening info, but it gives people solutions.
[02:09:15.477 --> 02:09:19.279]  And it's not just my videos, like Invisible Empire, Obama Deception, Endgame.
[02:09:19.279 --> 02:09:24.181]  By the way, we've got a special running right now where you can get a free Endgame when you order other videos, because this film is so important.
[02:09:24.181 --> 02:09:31.584]  This is still one of our best sellers three and a half years later, but I'm giving them away free when you get Invisible Empire, when you get Obama Deception, when you get some of the other films.
[02:09:31.584 --> 02:09:32.765]  You can get the New World Order film,
[02:09:33.565 --> 02:09:43.394]  That of course aired on the Independent Film Channel, free with some of the documentaries for a limited time at Infowars.com.
[02:09:43.394 --> 02:09:47.698]  The Secret of Oz, all about the banking system and solutions.
[02:09:47.698 --> 02:09:53.383]  That's available, don't tread on me, for every county servant, for every sheriff who's a servant of the people.
[02:09:53.383 --> 02:09:58.868]  Everyone needs to see this about the 10th Amendment with Sheriff Mack, myself, Edwin Vieira, and many others.
[02:09:58.868 --> 02:09:59.649]  Don't tread on me.
[02:10:00.209 --> 02:10:14.656]  This is the info that is a stake in the heart of the vampires all available at InfoWars.com or you can download all of my films including other films we've been authorized to post on PrisonPlanet.tv that I didn't produce but that I'm in like Camp FEMA.
[02:10:15.456 --> 02:10:15.737]  I don't
[02:10:34.159 --> 02:10:36.720]  The Awakening and Accelerate the Awakening that's happening.
[02:10:36.720 --> 02:10:53.008]  So see them all at PrisonPlanet.TV as well as the simulcast of the radio show in Living Color, the simulcast at PrisonPlanet.TV and all my films and my book and Paul Watson's book and the weekly reports he's doing and now Steve's doing reports and Kurt Nemo's about to do reports, all at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:10:53.008 --> 02:10:55.669]  We just keep adding more and more.
[02:10:55.669 --> 02:10:56.929]  But please take action today.
[02:10:56.929 --> 02:11:00.031]  InfoWars.com, two different shopping carts to choose from.
[02:11:00.791 --> 02:11:05.315]  We've got deals where you get a t-shirt, get a free ball cap, because we know the economy's falling apart.
[02:11:05.315 --> 02:11:06.856]  We just want to get this stuff out there.
[02:11:06.856 --> 02:11:13.741]  It's all available at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:11:13.741 --> 02:11:18.285]  And also, don't forget another great site to get information, TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[02:11:18.285 --> 02:11:21.447]  And I noticed, Bob Chapman, that there's a new redesign.
[02:11:21.447 --> 02:11:27.152]  I like the old design, but the new design is kind of a Web 2.0 look at The International Forecaster.
[02:11:27.152 --> 02:11:28.193]  Tell us about those changes.
[02:11:29.815 --> 02:11:41.084]  Well the changes came about through having the same site for I guess about 10 years and actually I really didn't have much to do with it.
[02:11:41.084 --> 02:11:55.016]  Other people are more talented in that area than I did it and I'm very happy with it and I hope everybody likes it and we certainly get a lot of hits on that site for being an entity that doesn't advertise at all.
[02:11:55.589 --> 02:11:56.649]  Absolutely, my friend.
[02:11:56.649 --> 02:12:00.951]  Now, let's continue, and then we're going to go to calls.
[02:12:00.951 --> 02:12:04.032]  For those that just joined us, we were getting into the future of the dollar.
[02:12:04.032 --> 02:12:10.214]  What does it mean when the IMF is in the news the last week and a half straight saying, America is too much in debt.
[02:12:10.214 --> 02:12:18.838]  You've got to love this consortium of bankers that publicly engineered this, openly calling for themselves to be given world government power for us to pay them carbon taxes.
[02:12:18.838 --> 02:12:24.780]  And they're in the news today, all over the news, saying the answer to your problems is cutting Social Security,
[02:12:25.220 --> 02:12:29.902]  Well, first of all, it's the wrong thing to have austerity and to increase taxes simultaneously.
[02:12:29.902 --> 02:12:32.483]  It's the best thing to do is to have austerity and cut taxes.
[02:12:54.682 --> 02:13:04.645]  So that money will continue to flow into the economy so that you don't have a dangerous and wretched depression.
[02:13:04.645 --> 02:13:21.990]  As far as the dollar being jettisoned, the powers that be within the United States from behind the scenes banking and Wall Street, they have ravaged the dollar ever since after the Second World War and of course
[02:13:22.786 --> 02:13:32.455]  Since August 15, 1971, when we had the gold backing taken away from the dollar.
[02:13:32.455 --> 02:13:34.437]  And it's been downhill since then.
[02:13:34.437 --> 02:13:39.841]  And everybody who is in that genre is very well aware of it.
[02:13:39.841 --> 02:13:45.206]  And so they finally decided that it's time that the dollar was replaced.
[02:13:45.206 --> 02:13:49.590]  And they would like to use the SDR, which is backed by nothing.
[02:13:50.593 --> 02:13:53.615]  And so it's no better than the dollar or any other currency.
[02:13:53.615 --> 02:13:56.277]  It's fiat, as it's called.
[02:13:56.277 --> 02:14:07.763]  And so what they want to do is kick the ball off by getting carbon taxes passed in the United States and then throughout the world.
[02:14:07.763 --> 02:14:17.169]  And part of those tax revenues will go to the IMF and the World Bank, and they will
[02:14:17.822 --> 02:14:23.344]  Back the SDR with income that comes from these carbon taxes.
[02:14:23.344 --> 02:14:34.968]  At the same time, there'll be a big meeting, like so many in the past, and they will devalue or revalue all currencies versus the SDR.
[02:14:34.968 --> 02:14:37.289]  And that'll be arbitrary in nature.
[02:14:37.289 --> 02:14:43.971]  And then I think they will also have multilateral defaults among nations.
[02:14:43.971 --> 02:14:45.172]  And the final
[02:14:46.156 --> 02:14:51.200]  Configuration, I don't know as yet because we're not close enough to that happening.
[02:14:51.200 --> 02:14:54.182]  But that's what I think they intend to do.
[02:14:54.182 --> 02:15:00.727]  And that, of course, is why gold and silver are doing as well as they have.
[02:15:00.727 --> 02:15:04.630]  Because people are saying, gee, I don't want another fiat currency.
[02:15:04.630 --> 02:15:10.875]  Now, that currency, the SDR, won't be used in commerce domestically by nations.
[02:15:10.875 --> 02:15:15.219]  Nations will still have their dollars and their pounds, etc.
[02:15:16.599 --> 02:15:19.862]  Until they decide to make a change in that as well.
[02:15:19.862 --> 02:15:26.668]  But for the time being, I think they'll revalue and devalue the currencies versus the SDR.
[02:15:26.668 --> 02:15:41.061]  I also feel, and I was talking about that when the break came, is that the European nations and the European banks are no better off now than they were two and a half to three years ago.
[02:15:41.061 --> 02:15:43.463]  And neither are the banks in the United States.
[02:15:44.597 --> 02:15:49.499]  And there's another crisis brewing.
[02:15:49.499 --> 02:15:52.380]  Nothing has been put to rest over there.
[02:15:52.380 --> 02:16:00.004]  I think that eventually, the weaker countries will pull away from the euro, and I think it'll be abandoned.
[02:16:00.004 --> 02:16:12.149]  And why I say that more than anything else is that not all the mistakes that they've made, which should be prevalent to people who watch that scene,
[02:16:13.287 --> 02:16:18.309]  But also, I see in Europe a move toward decentralization.
[02:16:18.309 --> 02:16:25.832]  They went into centralization with the European Union, and it really hasn't worked very well.
[02:16:25.832 --> 02:16:29.373]  The German public really wants to get out of both of them.
[02:16:29.373 --> 02:16:33.095]  And I think they think it's time.
[02:16:33.095 --> 02:16:42.058]  They think that was, in part, punishment for what went on during World War II, as was the grievous price that they had to pay
[02:16:42.785 --> 02:16:47.369]  To join the two Germanys together some time ago.
[02:16:47.369 --> 02:16:51.392]  I guess it was in 1991-92.
[02:16:51.392 --> 02:16:54.234]  And so I see disruption there.
[02:16:54.234 --> 02:16:56.236]  Well, this is being reflected throughout the world.
[02:16:56.236 --> 02:17:01.060]  I mean, we've got all kinds of banks that are insolvent, central banks.
[02:17:01.060 --> 02:17:11.528]  We've got the United States government, particularly the Treasury, and other central banks, along with the Fed Reserve, who are trying to make and talk gold down for the last 25 years.
[02:17:13.172 --> 02:17:15.814]  Uh, relatively unsuccessfully.
[02:17:15.814 --> 02:17:23.979]  And I think what we're doing on talk radio, as well as on the internet, is really taking its toll.
[02:17:23.979 --> 02:17:26.180]  And we talk about this every week.
[02:17:26.180 --> 02:17:31.123]  And I heard you talk about it with David Icke as well.
[02:17:31.123 --> 02:17:33.665]  We've got him on the run, and we've got to keep him that way.
[02:17:34.366 --> 02:17:53.315]  Well, Australia has announced, because their government's approval ratings are literally in the low 20s, and when the people are asked, why are you angry, we're angry about the carbon tax, which is very draconian there, the most draconian in the world we've seen, where they just laid over half the country's land that people already owned, that farmers were using off-limits.
[02:17:53.315 --> 02:18:00.119]  We're mad about the carbon tax, we're mad about internet censorship, and so they've now said, okay, we're gonna drop it for a year,
[02:18:01.345 --> 02:18:03.947]  And they admitted because of an election coming up.
[02:18:03.947 --> 02:18:05.768]  And I see this tactic constantly.
[02:18:05.768 --> 02:18:11.192]  They can tell when we build up to a critical mass that if they continue to fight us, we're going to win.
[02:18:11.192 --> 02:18:13.634]  So they always back off.
[02:18:13.634 --> 02:18:23.641]  That's like twice in the last five years they were going to put illegal toll roads on 183 North, Mopac, 290, all the major roads of Austin where you can go nowhere.
[02:18:24.441 --> 02:18:48.649]  I mean I live 15 miles at least from my office and I can get here in about 15 minutes because there's big nice highways that were built in the last two decades and I paid for them and they're all paid for and I paid for them with a gas tax and they admit this isn't even about paying for new roads this is about taxes because foreign center of Spain has come in this is globalism
[02:18:49.369 --> 02:18:49.569]  Yeah.
[02:19:10.382 --> 02:19:11.322]  Well, it's a strategic withdrawal.
[02:19:11.322 --> 02:19:11.883]  It's dialectic in nature.
[02:19:33.567 --> 02:19:34.748]  And I'll come back with you.
[02:19:34.748 --> 02:19:36.088]  Yeah, we'll talk about it when we get back.
[02:19:36.088 --> 02:19:37.509]  It just makes me so mad.
[02:19:37.509 --> 02:19:42.151]  And of course, it's Kirk Watson, and everybody's got their local shyster like him.
[02:19:42.151 --> 02:19:54.596]  This former mayor that literally stole tens of thousands of acres from people, turned around and gave it to himself, built things all over it when it was supposed to be environmental preserves, and now he's illegally up there, openly illegally!
[02:19:54.596 --> 02:19:55.917]  I mean, it's illegal!
[02:19:55.917 --> 02:19:59.839]  Gonna slap toll roads on everything when we've beaten him over and over again!
[02:20:02.731 --> 02:20:04.733]  Remain in your houses.
[02:20:04.733 --> 02:20:10.498]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[02:20:10.498 --> 02:20:11.859]  Will they do it?
[02:20:11.859 --> 02:20:14.482]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[02:20:14.482 --> 02:20:20.947]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[02:20:20.947 --> 02:20:23.149]  Think it can't happen here?
[02:20:23.149 --> 02:20:25.171]  Executive Order 10990 locks down all highways.
[02:20:27.393 --> 02:20:32.274]  Executive Order 10995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[02:20:32.274 --> 02:20:37.195]  Executive Order 10998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[02:20:37.195 --> 02:20:42.937]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[02:20:42.937 --> 02:20:51.359]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to martiallawsurvival.com.

[02:22:36.593 --> 02:22:42.397]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.

[02:23:59.850 --> 02:24:00.451]  In a can.
[02:24:21.980 --> 02:24:35.408]  Okay, Bob, getting into that point of strategic retreats, because they know that we're not playing this conscious game of deception like they are, and so every time that we reach critical mass, they're gonna beat them, they retreat, but only attack again.
[02:24:35.408 --> 02:24:42.773]  It's basically like in a war, someone's saying, let's have a ceasefire, and you go, okay, and lower your guns, and they shoot you in the chest.
[02:24:42.773 --> 02:24:45.635]  Continue commenting on that.
[02:24:45.635 --> 02:24:48.056]  Well, they want us to lose momentum.
[02:24:48.056 --> 02:24:49.377]  They want us to forget about it.
[02:24:49.377 --> 02:24:50.978]  They want the public to forget about it.
[02:24:51.579 --> 02:24:54.320]  And then they'll come back stronger than ever.
[02:24:54.320 --> 02:24:56.981]  And only we're going to be waiting for them.
[02:24:56.981 --> 02:25:04.204]  Because we know their tactics and our listeners are gaining knowledge in the games that are played.
[02:25:04.204 --> 02:25:12.086]  Well plus it shows what crooks they are that they constantly, internationally, nationally and locally, lie and say we're done, it's never going to happen.
[02:25:12.086 --> 02:25:13.127]  And then they come back again.
[02:25:14.935 --> 02:25:17.075]  Yeah, it's kind of like zombies.
[02:25:17.075 --> 02:25:19.976]  But anyway, you like that, huh?
[02:25:19.976 --> 02:25:23.457]  But anyway, that's what their game is.
[02:25:23.457 --> 02:25:32.739]  I was reading a piece by Carol Quigley today who wrote in 1965 about what the Illuminists were going to do and spelled it all out.
[02:25:32.739 --> 02:25:37.100]  I was amazed at the time that he wrote the book.
[02:25:37.100 --> 02:25:41.521]  But it shows you, maybe in modern times, the beginning of their arrogance.
[02:25:42.319 --> 02:25:47.861]  And, you know, Freud and others touched upon the control of the masses.
[02:25:47.861 --> 02:25:54.123]  In fact, I'm running a piece along with all of those links from Infowars.
[02:25:54.123 --> 02:25:56.844]  I must have six or seven of them on there.
[02:25:56.844 --> 02:25:58.764]  And because they're great.
[02:25:58.764 --> 02:26:02.225]  And so if you don't mind, I'll continue to run them.
[02:26:02.225 --> 02:26:11.228]  And so we're talking about the control of the minds of Americans and people throughout the world.
[02:26:12.089 --> 02:26:21.392]  And we're going to beat them at their own game by telling people the truth and telling the people that this is what they're doing to you with the media.
[02:26:21.392 --> 02:26:23.733]  You may not realize it.
[02:26:23.733 --> 02:26:33.516]  You may have a high school degree or a couple of years of college or even a degree, but you're not trained in that area and you don't see the things that we see.
[02:26:33.516 --> 02:26:38.557]  I know when I went into counterintelligence, one of the first things that we read about was brainwashing.
[02:26:38.557 --> 02:26:40.518]  That's what it was called in the early 1950s.
[02:26:42.399 --> 02:26:52.641]  And so it hasn't really changed a lot since then, except it's become more sophisticated and the depth of knowledge is far greater.
[02:26:52.641 --> 02:26:54.342]  But don't let them fool you.
[02:26:54.342 --> 02:26:56.022]  We're here for a reason.
[02:26:56.022 --> 02:26:57.902]  And we're here to help you.
[02:26:57.902 --> 02:27:02.263]  And that's why we do what we do, especially me at my age.
[02:27:02.263 --> 02:27:06.044]  And so let's keep the pressure on them.
[02:27:06.044 --> 02:27:10.085]  And when they ease up, we'll remind them, we know what you're doing.
[02:27:12.878 --> 02:27:15.198]  Well, they know that the momentum is shifting against them.
[02:27:15.198 --> 02:27:19.979]  Before we get back to the economy and the calls in the next segment, they won an Iran war.
[02:27:19.979 --> 02:27:25.041]  And now it's just all over the news that they're going to go ahead and strike Iran, maybe even use nukes on them.
[02:27:25.041 --> 02:27:34.402]  I mean, I guess even though they know it's going to be unpopular and illegal, they've got to do it as a political distraction because everything else they're doing is falling apart.
[02:27:34.402 --> 02:27:37.123]  That's right.
[02:27:37.123 --> 02:27:41.204]  And, you know, how do we explain this plethora of
[02:27:45.440 --> 02:28:07.939]  Oh that's another 44 ships the government's voted to allow troops and Marines and helicopters and armored vehicles on the land to fight drug dealers and it sounds like some kind of bizarre coup like the government of Costa Rica is bringing the US in ahead of them being voted out in elections I mean that's all you can see it as
[02:28:08.752 --> 02:28:13.235]  Now Costa Rica, I guess, has to be invaded.
[02:28:13.235 --> 02:28:18.358]  Well, I live there.
[02:28:18.358 --> 02:28:21.320]  It's a great center for laundering money.
[02:28:21.320 --> 02:28:28.665]  But in the time I lived there, there was very little drugs in the country.
[02:28:28.665 --> 02:28:37.371]  Maybe you're right about the politics, but I know many people and families
[02:28:37.950 --> 02:28:40.792]  Who are coked at the top of the government.
[02:28:40.792 --> 02:28:46.577]  And, uh, you know, there isn't a lot of difference between either party.
[02:28:46.577 --> 02:28:57.025]  Um, I find it hard to buy that the new president, which is a lady, I think her name is Chihuahua, uh, or something similar to that.
[02:28:57.025 --> 02:29:00.227]  Uh, please excuse me if I'm wrong.
[02:29:00.227 --> 02:29:05.371]  Uh, I don't know that there's a political problem.
[02:29:05.371 --> 02:29:07.553]  I really can't figure out what they're doing there yet.
[02:29:10.367 --> 02:29:13.890]  I sure can figure out what's going on in the Persian Gulf.
[02:29:13.890 --> 02:29:17.353]  I mean, that's very obvious, as you said.
[02:29:17.353 --> 02:29:18.514]  They're getting ready to go.
[02:29:18.514 --> 02:29:25.699]  Well, I tell you, if you look at Grenada and then you look again at Panama, they use the same lie both times.
[02:29:25.699 --> 02:29:27.741]  They would say terrorist.
[02:29:27.741 --> 02:29:33.565]  And this is 100% was some truth to it in the island, but with the case of Panama,
[02:29:34.636 --> 02:29:38.558]  They just claim that college students have been kidnapped.
[02:29:38.558 --> 02:29:41.199]  And then it was on local news and even came out in some U.S.
[02:29:41.199 --> 02:29:45.361]  news that they went to the dormitory and the girls said no one was holding us hostage.
[02:29:45.361 --> 02:29:52.605]  And they just invaded and blew the hell out of Panama City for no reason but that Manuel Noriega was gonna, well... We're on the march.
[02:29:52.605 --> 02:29:55.126]  The Empire's on the run.

[02:33:09.392 --> 02:33:13.174]  Bob Chapman is our guest.
[02:33:13.174 --> 02:33:22.239]  Going to your phone calls here momentarily on this live Friday edition.
[02:33:22.239 --> 02:33:25.081]  We have the sheriff who's got a Mexican
[02:33:40.117 --> 02:33:45.964]  Hit out on him, a contract out on him, joining us, coming up in the next hour.
[02:33:45.964 --> 02:33:49.369]  Very important information.
[02:33:49.369 --> 02:33:54.836]  But Bob, getting back into the economy, because we only spoke a few minutes about that.
[02:33:56.980 --> 02:34:04.387]  Why do you think they're finally announcing in CNBC and the New York Times and just everywhere, okay, it's a depression?
[02:34:04.387 --> 02:34:10.413]  I mean, my answer is, because now they're going to sell us the next solution, giving the very bankers that did this more power.
[02:34:10.413 --> 02:34:16.479]  I hate to even call them bankers, because there are real banks and real banks that loan money locally that do a good job in many cases.
[02:34:16.479 --> 02:34:20.783]  But these swindlers, these money changers, these globalists that pose
[02:34:21.463 --> 02:34:24.626]  Well, I think that the public realizes there's something dramatically wrong.
[02:34:46.550 --> 02:34:59.854]  What they call it is irrelevant, and the recognition of that by the media may have come about because of the tremendous outside pressures that we've created.
[02:34:59.854 --> 02:35:15.178]  And I think that it could also be that, and I put this in the International Forecaster not too long ago, I've been told because Congress has refused to
[02:35:15.956 --> 02:35:16.497]  I don't
[02:35:40.382 --> 02:35:47.507]  Major media was saying, gee, it's going to be a double-dip recession and, you know, woe is me.
[02:35:47.507 --> 02:35:53.552]  And then all of a sudden, perhaps several months from now, everything starts to turn around.
[02:35:53.552 --> 02:36:00.117]  And the media would say, well, and that's the people who said these things, that, well, look, I guess we were wrong.
[02:36:00.117 --> 02:36:04.440]  Things are turning around and it's going to be okay.
[02:36:04.440 --> 02:36:06.862]  And so they can, you know, go with the other side.
[02:36:07.438 --> 02:36:09.219]  But that's what I think is going to happen.
[02:36:09.219 --> 02:36:11.681]  It'll be very inflationary.
[02:36:11.681 --> 02:36:26.432]  It'll probably keep the stock market from plunging where it should plunge to on a short-term basis, but the market's still going to go down to reflect lower earnings and lower GDP during the second half of this year.
[02:36:26.432 --> 02:36:29.154]  And I think you're seeing that in the market now.
[02:36:29.154 --> 02:36:33.717]  Yes, we had a couple of mini-recoveries, one during the last week.
[02:36:34.446 --> 02:36:38.968]  Which Wall Street would call a dead cat bounce.
[02:36:38.968 --> 02:36:45.312]  And I think we're going down to the $8,8500 area here prior to the election.
[02:36:45.312 --> 02:36:47.152]  We could go deeper.
[02:36:47.152 --> 02:36:50.714]  And it's because the fundamentals just aren't there.
[02:36:50.714 --> 02:36:55.477]  Through stimulus and through the Fed, both are producing about $2.3 trillion.
[02:36:55.477 --> 02:37:02.760]  All we did was go sideways for a little over a year and slightly higher in GDP.
[02:37:02.760 --> 02:37:04.041]  Very little was accomplished.
[02:37:04.748 --> 02:37:11.471]  Unemployment of this second half of the year, easily 25% in real rates.
[02:37:11.471 --> 02:37:16.553]  And then you have all these people who are going to be roaming around, too many of them without checks anymore.
[02:37:16.553 --> 02:37:18.794]  They're not going to be very happy.
[02:37:18.794 --> 02:37:28.979]  So I think August and September are going to be volatile months because I think a lot of people are going to be complaining, some might demonstrate there could possibly be riots.
[02:37:28.979 --> 02:37:34.101]  But I don't foresee that, at least in my mind's eye at this point in time.
[02:37:34.873 --> 02:37:56.566]  And so, you're going to have a lower stock market, and there's going to be a lot of people who are going to be disgruntled about that, because the value of their pensions and their cash value life insurance policies, and also your annuities are going to go down in value, because the stocks are going down and they own them.
[02:37:56.566 --> 02:37:59.408]  And so, it's not a happy time.
[02:37:59.408 --> 02:38:03.270]  And even if the Fed throws money at the whole thing, will it work?
[02:38:05.322 --> 02:38:19.312]  Well, regardless, now is the time to get the maximum effort out, because the system is trying to use the crisis they've created to remake the world in their image, where they have even more power to control our lives and become even more wealthy.
[02:38:19.312 --> 02:38:27.418]  And it's critical that during this crisis, when people are actually ready to listen, that we tell the truth, so there's an alternative to their tyranny.
[02:38:27.418 --> 02:38:32.002]  So this is such an important crossroads, such an important critical time in history.
[02:38:32.878 --> 02:38:34.819]  Let's go to Shanky in Georgia.
[02:38:34.819 --> 02:38:36.179]  You're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[02:38:36.179 --> 02:38:37.399]  Go ahead.
[02:38:37.399 --> 02:38:38.420]  Hey, guys.
[02:38:38.420 --> 02:38:40.000]  Thanks for having me on.
[02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:49.123]  Alex, I just want to let you know I became a Prison Planet member a couple weeks ago, and the videos on there really are over-the-top, unbelievable, informative, really well done.
[02:38:49.123 --> 02:38:54.044]  I've really enjoyed being a member over there.
[02:38:54.044 --> 02:38:55.225]  I think you're right.
[02:38:55.225 --> 02:39:01.747]  Bob and y'all are right with radio and the Internet being the main vehicles to keep us all motivated.
[02:39:03.499 --> 02:39:04.299]  Get the word out.
[02:39:04.299 --> 02:39:07.641]  That is, you know, as long as we have the internet, you know.
[02:39:22.907 --> 02:39:24.688]  Alex, let me give you kudos on one thing.
[02:39:24.688 --> 02:39:33.531]  You are the only person on the planet to point out that LeBron didn't go to Chicago because Illinois has got $13 billion in debt.
[02:39:33.531 --> 02:39:36.873]  He's not going to go to a city, a state, that's underwater.
[02:39:36.873 --> 02:39:38.734]  I want to give you kudos for that.
[02:39:38.734 --> 02:39:50.779]  No, I mean, that's how I knew, and of course, Jaren pointed this out as well to me, that Florida doesn't have a state income tax like Texas and a few others, and so of course he's going to go there if he's getting
[02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:52.801]  What's his contract?
[02:39:52.801 --> 02:39:53.941]  99 million or something?
[02:40:13.172 --> 02:40:24.598]  And that's why everybody's leaving England, and people are leaving France, and that's why the UN has said over and over again, and so has the OECD, this big global management group, that they want worldwide taxes.
[02:40:24.598 --> 02:40:30.561]  The New World Order, first and foremost, is about unified taxes so they can jack them up and up and up and no one can run.
[02:40:30.561 --> 02:40:33.642]  Let's get a quick comment on that from Bob, and you can come back, Shanky.
[02:40:33.642 --> 02:40:35.223]  Go ahead, Bob.
[02:40:35.223 --> 02:40:41.546]  That is certainly true, and these banks in these countries all over the world are following OECD guidelines.
[02:40:42.518 --> 02:40:45.179]  Right to a T. It just isn't, you know, the U.S.
[02:40:45.179 --> 02:40:46.799]  pushing the issue.
[02:40:46.799 --> 02:40:48.960]  It is the OECD.
[02:40:48.960 --> 02:40:51.921]  And they are doing it.
[02:40:51.921 --> 02:40:58.422]  Most countries that I know of question everything that goes through your account.
[02:40:58.422 --> 02:41:11.726]  And, you know, they want to know, well, you just received $100,000 check from XYZ company in the United States to go into your account in Mexico City.
[02:41:12.958 --> 02:41:14.821]  Uh, why did you do that?
[02:41:14.821 --> 02:41:17.847]  And then the company says, well, you know, we're in business.
[02:41:17.847 --> 02:41:19.350]  And we sell things in the United States.
[02:41:19.350 --> 02:41:21.815]  And then meanwhile... And then meanwhile... When do you think you came from heaven?
[02:41:22.842 --> 02:41:32.067]  Exactly, but then meanwhile, hundreds of billions of dollars of drug money are laundered by Federal Reserve megabank members, shareholders, and that's not an issue, that's left alone.
[02:41:32.067 --> 02:41:45.813]  But now they're trying to change IRS regulations, and I actually got an email about this, people wanted me to ask you, where $600, if you sell a $600 used riding lawnmower, they're saying it's going to be a federal felony if you don't report that and pay taxes.
[02:41:45.813 --> 02:41:49.255]  They know the underground economy is keeping America hanging on.
[02:41:49.255 --> 02:41:50.456]  They want us bankrupt.
[02:41:51.036 --> 02:41:59.080]  And so they're going to harass some car wash in California for a four cent unpaid tax bill.
[02:41:59.080 --> 02:42:01.801]  And that was in the news up in Sacramento.
[02:42:01.801 --> 02:42:03.222]  The IRS showed up with armed agents.
[02:42:03.222 --> 02:42:06.063]  But meanwhile, hundreds of billions are in the banks of drug money.
[02:42:06.063 --> 02:42:08.244]  That's not going to be looked at.
[02:42:08.244 --> 02:42:09.424]  That's right.
[02:42:09.424 --> 02:42:10.525]  And what are we talking about?
[02:42:10.525 --> 02:42:15.147]  We're talking about about three quarters of a trillion dollars a year.
[02:42:16.201 --> 02:42:24.669]  And about $300 billion of that comes out of Afghanistan in the form of marijuana and what eventually becomes heroin.
[02:42:24.669 --> 02:42:25.851]  You mean opium?
[02:42:25.851 --> 02:42:30.855]  Yeah, I guess who's running it?
[02:42:30.855 --> 02:42:34.459]  Well, they admit our government's growing the opium over there.
[02:42:34.459 --> 02:42:35.220]  Anything else, Shanky?
[02:42:36.007 --> 02:42:53.428]  Yeah, real quick, Bob's got a great post on your site with the recent gold market takedowns, and he's got a statement in there that says the result of the stretchers coming with the complete collapse of the stock market and the end of real estate as an investment, the powers.
[02:42:53.428 --> 02:42:55.090]  Bob, talk a little bit more about
[02:42:55.774 --> 02:43:00.017]  The gold manipulation, if you can sum it up in a few minutes, and I'll hang up.
[02:43:00.017 --> 02:43:00.837]  Yeah, real fast.
[02:43:00.837 --> 02:43:02.558]  I mean, I can boil it down to get Bob's take.
[02:43:02.558 --> 02:43:03.939]  It's very simple.
[02:43:03.939 --> 02:43:04.720]  It's like a beach ball.
[02:43:04.720 --> 02:43:07.141]  They can push it down, but it always goes up even higher.
[02:43:07.141 --> 02:43:12.284]  You look at the year-long, or the two-year, or the five-year, or the seven-year graph, it's straight up.
[02:43:12.284 --> 02:43:14.506]  But the manipulation is damaging the economy.
[02:43:14.506 --> 02:43:16.707]  Bob, tell folks.
[02:43:16.707 --> 02:43:19.909]  And they started that in 68 illegally.
[02:43:19.909 --> 02:43:24.172]  It became legal in 88 through the working group in financial markets.
[02:43:25.024 --> 02:43:31.991]  Uh, a, uh, executive order, and it's not only the gold and silver market, they're manipulating everything.
[02:43:31.991 --> 02:43:35.574]  I mean, this is truly a corporatist, fascist economy.
[02:43:35.574 --> 02:43:46.664]  And, yes, as the gentleman said, uh, and you did as well, Alex, uh, it's like a beach ball, and, uh, yeah, they can push it under, but it comes popping right back up again.
[02:43:46.664 --> 02:43:50.508]  And, uh, it's going to continue to do that because it's the only real money in the world.
[02:43:51.789 --> 02:43:52.349]  Well said.
[02:43:52.349 --> 02:43:53.930]  Let's go to another caller.
[02:43:53.930 --> 02:43:55.651]  Let's talk to Duff in Kansas.
[02:43:55.651 --> 02:43:56.331]  You're on the air.
[02:43:56.331 --> 02:44:01.934]  Alex, it's a real privilege to get to talk to you.
[02:44:01.934 --> 02:44:05.715]  Duff, it's good to talk to you, but your phone is really bad.
[02:44:05.715 --> 02:44:09.917]  Try to get it out quick.
[02:44:09.917 --> 02:44:16.200]  Put Duff on hold and see if they can get a better Skype or a better, you know, get to a better spot on their cell phone.
[02:44:16.200 --> 02:44:18.541]  It's just, it's unintelligible, Duff.
[02:44:18.541 --> 02:44:19.842]  Leo in Pennsylvania.
[02:44:19.842 --> 02:44:20.382]  You're on the air.
[02:44:21.477 --> 02:44:22.897]  Mr. Jones, how are you today?
[02:44:22.897 --> 02:44:23.297]  Good, sir.
[02:44:23.297 --> 02:44:24.618]  Welcome.
[02:44:24.618 --> 02:44:29.959]  I hail you once again for all your efforts to continue to expose these people.
[02:44:29.959 --> 02:44:40.160]  Listen, this morning you were talking about conditioning and how they use celebrities, you know, to make us think that these people are something that they really aren't.
[02:44:40.160 --> 02:44:47.102]  You know, Hollywood's been using films for a number of years to condition us into believing certain things.
[02:44:47.102 --> 02:44:48.142]  Now, hold on to your hat.
[02:44:49.372 --> 02:44:57.477]  I watched the movie last night called Thirteen, The Conspiracy, and they constantly refer to the New World Order in the film.
[02:44:57.477 --> 02:45:01.059]  All these, an assassination attempt takes place.
[02:45:01.059 --> 02:45:04.481]  Actually, it becomes a reality where they assassinate the President.
[02:45:04.481 --> 02:45:13.907]  And they use this as a premise to show people that this New World Order is needed, desperately, to bring control and put an end to the violence in the country.
[02:45:14.858 --> 02:45:19.501]  They've been doing this for so long, it's actually gotten to the point where it's ridiculous.
[02:45:19.501 --> 02:45:19.801]  Really?
[02:45:19.801 --> 02:45:23.544]  So in this movie, they sell world government as a savior?
[02:45:23.544 --> 02:45:24.365]  Exactly.
[02:45:24.365 --> 02:45:26.926]  Now, I have a question for Mr. Chapman today.
[02:45:26.926 --> 02:45:27.727]  Is he there?
[02:45:27.727 --> 02:45:28.007]  Yes.
[02:45:28.007 --> 02:45:30.109]  I apparently am.
[02:45:30.109 --> 02:45:31.710]  Yeah, Bob, listen.
[02:45:31.710 --> 02:45:38.174]  I know that you have the answers to a lot of these questions, and my big question is this.
[02:45:38.174 --> 02:45:40.596]  Are you aware of a time frame
[02:45:41.369 --> 02:45:45.150]  Well, first of all, timing in here is so difficult, because we're forcing them to change their plans.
[02:45:45.150 --> 02:45:46.190]  We're forcing them to make mistakes.
[02:45:46.190 --> 02:45:50.471]  They never thought Greece would turn out the way it has, with the great people saying, hey, we don't want to do that.
[02:46:11.192 --> 02:46:16.314]  And so there are things that are happening, changing things, so you really can't put a timeline on it.
[02:46:16.314 --> 02:46:21.016]  All you can do is tell people this is really what they want to do and let's let them do it.
[02:46:21.016 --> 02:46:27.858]  And, you know, file your complaints with your elected members and hope it does them good.
[02:46:27.858 --> 02:46:30.199]  But timing's too hard.
[02:46:30.199 --> 02:46:33.760]  The timing in the Middle East right now is not too difficult.
[02:46:33.760 --> 02:46:36.301]  I mean, how many vessels do they have there?
[02:46:36.914 --> 02:46:42.095]  And how many planes and how many hundreds of thousands of people ready to attack Iran?
[02:46:42.095 --> 02:46:45.276]  And you've got Netanyahu visiting and they're saying they're getting ready for war.
[02:46:45.276 --> 02:46:47.416]  Let me comment on this.
[02:46:47.416 --> 02:46:49.056]  The Mark of the Beast is here.
[02:46:49.056 --> 02:46:50.497]  The Cashflow Society is here.
[02:46:50.497 --> 02:47:02.119]  In my first film made 13 years ago, America Destroyed by Design, I have Bill Clinton's executive order to take blood and other DNA to get a driver's license, to biometrically face scan and thumbprint.
[02:47:02.967 --> 02:47:03.167]  I don't
[02:47:22.997 --> 02:47:27.480]  Already, all 50 states have standardized their driver's license to the Fed.
[02:47:27.480 --> 02:47:30.282]  Some are fighting against new regulations.
[02:47:30.282 --> 02:47:37.886]  They just pass a random Real ID law and then they can just keep adding regulations onto that blank check.
[02:47:37.886 --> 02:47:48.473]  They're putting thumb printers in at tanning salons, at gyms, at restaurants, at people to clock in at work, in Pennsylvania and other areas, inside the stores.
[02:47:49.093 --> 02:47:52.234]  The grocery stores basically won't, and this is mainstream news today.
[02:47:52.234 --> 02:47:54.315]  In fact, give me a close shot of this.
[02:47:54.315 --> 02:47:59.957]  The grocery stores won't be allowed to sell you beer because they can't be trusted.
[02:47:59.957 --> 02:48:06.500]  You'll have to go and face scan and breathalyzer and swipe your ID card to buy alcohol.
[02:48:06.500 --> 02:48:08.860]  They're going to have a new national sales tax.
[02:48:08.860 --> 02:48:10.001]  This has all been stated.
[02:48:10.001 --> 02:48:11.121]  That's going to be graduated.
[02:48:11.121 --> 02:48:12.942]  So, quote, poor people don't have to pay it.
[02:48:12.942 --> 02:48:17.744]  And so you'll have to swipe your card, though, to prove what bracket you're in because there'd be fraud if there wasn't.
[02:48:18.684 --> 02:48:20.785]  Who made less than you go buy something.
[02:48:20.785 --> 02:48:23.027]  So that tracks everything you're doing.
[02:48:23.027 --> 02:48:24.148]  We're here.
[02:48:24.148 --> 02:48:25.549]  We have a national ID card.
[02:48:25.549 --> 02:48:27.970]  In 2000 the UN had a meeting in Australia.
[02:48:27.970 --> 02:48:33.674]  It was in their papers that a global standardization for IDs and the numbers and the precepts had been set.
[02:48:33.674 --> 02:48:35.755]  We already have a global ID.
[02:48:35.755 --> 02:48:39.598]  Libya, Iran, a few other countries haven't adopted it.
[02:48:39.758 --> 02:48:45.000]  Okay, just like they've been taking your blood for 38 years secretly for DNA databases at birth, now they admit it.
[02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:48.041]  Just like they've been fluoridating worldwide in the West.
[02:48:48.041 --> 02:48:50.382]  Same standardization, one part per million.
[02:48:50.382 --> 02:48:52.582]  We are already in a global managed system.
[02:48:52.582 --> 02:49:00.865]  The OECD, the corporation set up to take over Europe after World War II, is a private corporate consortium, just like the WTO over trade.
[02:49:00.865 --> 02:49:02.706]  They decide everything financial.
[02:49:03.146 --> 02:49:05.327]  They decide how many numbers are on your driver's license.
[02:49:05.327 --> 02:49:12.212]  They decide, just like I've had all these members of parliament on from England, over 70% of their laws are EU decided.
[02:49:12.212 --> 02:49:18.776]  Well, Bush, his last year in office, signed the Transatlantic Alliance, merging the North American Union with the Euro.
[02:49:18.776 --> 02:49:21.818]  He gave a press conference saying, we have now merged.
[02:49:22.738 --> 02:49:29.523]  In 2000, they had the 50th anniversary of the Euro in all of the member countries, with huge marches and fireworks.
[02:49:29.523 --> 02:49:31.344]  Literally, no one showed up.
[02:49:31.344 --> 02:49:33.666]  You'd have parades with no one there.
[02:49:33.666 --> 02:49:45.975]  And they celebrated 50 years in 2007, because it really was set up in 1957 with the Treaty of Rome, though they officially set up the Euro in 2000.
[02:49:45.975 --> 02:49:48.557]  We're in a global government now, Bob Chapman.
[02:49:50.382 --> 02:49:51.263]  I agree with that.
[02:49:51.263 --> 02:50:16.556]  In fact, I just wrote an article in the last issue, and I'm continuing the coming issue, about Europe and its evolutionary process from the Common Market and EFTA, which I lived through because I lived in Europe at the time, and then the Treaty of Rome, and onward into GATT and then WTO, and to the place that we're at today, particularly in view of
[02:50:19.522 --> 02:50:25.007]  They're accomplishment in free trade, globalization, offshoring and outsourcing.
[02:50:25.007 --> 02:50:29.070]  And I think their system in Europe is breaking down.
[02:50:29.070 --> 02:50:35.755]  I think they're having a heck of a time, not only financially and economically, but nobody wants to play anymore.
[02:50:35.755 --> 02:50:40.758]  And so that's why I think the Euro is going to be history, and it may even break up the EU.
[02:50:41.733 --> 02:50:42.614]  Stay there.
[02:50:42.614 --> 02:50:45.997]  We're going to come back with more calls, and we'll keep you five minutes in the next segment.
[02:50:45.997 --> 02:50:54.864]  And then Sheriff Babiou is joining us from Arizona, coming up in the last hour for about 30 minutes, and we'll cover other news and important information.

[02:52:05.987 --> 02:52:06.988]  What have we got?
[02:52:06.988 --> 02:52:09.449]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:52:09.449 --> 02:52:10.450]  A republic.
[02:52:10.450 --> 02:52:13.092]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:52:13.092 --> 02:52:15.353]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:52:15.353 --> 02:52:17.374]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:52:17.374 --> 02:52:19.055]  So they think they own our land?
[02:52:19.055 --> 02:52:20.376]  They think they own our water?
[02:52:20.376 --> 02:52:20.976]  Children?
[02:52:20.976 --> 02:52:22.117]  Our education?
[02:52:22.117 --> 02:52:22.938]  Our money?
[02:52:22.938 --> 02:52:26.600]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:52:26.960 --> 02:52:31.926]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.

[02:54:29.838 --> 02:54:32.880]  We've got an article up at InfoWars.com.
[02:54:32.880 --> 02:54:40.226]  A great artist sent us his rendition of the evolution of a parasite.
[02:54:40.226 --> 02:54:41.527]  That's what I've dubbed it.
[02:54:41.527 --> 02:54:44.569]  We've got a little blurb that the author wrote about why he did this piece.
[02:54:44.569 --> 02:54:54.356]  It shows the evolution of communism, the parasitic system, the kingdom of the parasites, and it shows instead of the
[02:54:55.779 --> 02:54:56.039]  Yeah.
[02:55:12.674 --> 02:55:17.235]  Yeah, Ben Pack did that, so we've got that up on InfoWars.com right now.
[02:55:17.235 --> 02:55:20.836]  It's really talented material, if you want to check it out.
[02:55:20.836 --> 02:55:22.777]  We've got Bob with us until 5 after.
[02:55:22.777 --> 02:55:24.958]  Let's go to Mike in Tennessee.
[02:55:24.958 --> 02:55:27.158]  Mike, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:55:27.158 --> 02:55:28.339]  Thank you for having me.
[02:55:28.339 --> 02:55:29.979]  Good afternoon, gentlemen.
[02:55:29.979 --> 02:55:32.060]  Hello.
[02:55:32.060 --> 02:55:42.303]  I have a quick comment and a question that's related to the comment, and I'm going to have to ask Mr. Chapman to put on his intel officer hat here.
[02:55:42.731 --> 02:55:44.031]  For just a minute, if you would.
[02:55:44.031 --> 02:56:07.576]  A comment is you, Mr. Jones, were talking earlier about Israel's nuclear arsenal, and you may not have been meaning it this way, but it seemed to me that you were sort of saying that Israel was getting away with something, having these nuclear weapons, when they really weren't.
[02:56:07.576 --> 02:56:09.897]  What they did was that when it came time to sign up,
[02:56:12.029 --> 02:56:16.352]  The non-proliferation treaty, they just said no.
[02:56:16.352 --> 02:56:19.535]  I mean, you misunderstood what I was saying.
[02:56:19.535 --> 02:56:24.939]  Israel has always said that they don't have nukes, and in the last few years they said, well, if we do, it's a secret.
[02:56:24.939 --> 02:56:29.322]  I agree, nobody has to sign on to these United Nations treaties.
[02:56:29.322 --> 02:56:32.345]  And Israel shouldn't have to, and neither should Iran.
[02:56:32.345 --> 02:56:36.528]  My issue is, I'm against a preemptive nuclear attack on Iran.
[02:56:36.528 --> 02:56:37.789]  That is mass murder.
[02:56:37.789 --> 02:56:38.990]  That is evil.
[02:56:40.871 --> 02:56:43.393]  I mean, look, the Nazis thought they were doing good.
[02:56:43.393 --> 02:56:45.394]  The communists thought they were doing good.
[02:56:45.394 --> 02:56:48.096]  Our country thought it was doing good, killing Native Americans.
[02:56:48.096 --> 02:56:48.997]  This is wrong.
[02:56:48.997 --> 02:56:51.738]  We can't let this happen.
[02:56:51.738 --> 02:56:54.680]  Our government has overthrown Iran repeatedly.
[02:56:54.680 --> 02:56:56.882]  BP used to literally rule Iran.
[02:56:56.882 --> 02:57:01.145]  It had a previous name, Anglo-American Oil, inside Iran.
[02:57:01.145 --> 02:57:04.507]  I mean, Iran isn't perfect, and I'm not buddies with Iran.
[02:57:04.507 --> 02:57:05.088]  I'm against
[02:57:06.133 --> 02:57:07.194]  Exactly the same as yours.
[02:57:07.194 --> 02:57:08.794]  That was the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company.
[02:57:08.794 --> 02:57:10.435]  And they're the people who overthrew Mohammad Mossadegh.
[02:57:29.148 --> 02:57:31.229]  And that's how the shark came to power.
[02:57:31.229 --> 02:57:32.869]  That's right, it had a bunch of different names.
[02:57:32.869 --> 02:57:36.610]  Iranco, Anglo-American, Anglo-Iran.
[02:57:36.610 --> 02:57:40.691]  I mean, BP's always changing their name, and after this latest fiasco, they'll change it again.
[02:57:40.691 --> 02:57:43.571]  That's not what I'm trying to say.
[02:57:43.571 --> 02:57:45.992]  All I'm trying to say is there's a way out of the NPT.
[02:57:45.992 --> 02:57:52.394]  There's Article 13, you give your three-month notice, and you're out of the NPT.
[02:57:52.394 --> 02:57:54.314]  That's what North Korea did.
[02:57:54.861 --> 02:58:01.143]  When they realized that we were actually serious about them being in the NPT and wanted to send investigators in there.
[02:58:01.143 --> 02:58:03.723]  They said, oh you mean this is like serious?
[02:58:03.723 --> 02:58:08.085]  We actually have to be members of the NPT to the point where we have to accept your inspectors?
[02:58:08.085 --> 02:58:09.105]  No thanks!
[02:58:09.105 --> 02:58:09.685]  Okay?
[02:58:09.685 --> 02:58:10.685]  We're out of here!
[02:58:10.685 --> 02:58:13.026]  And they gave their three months notice and they left the NPT.
[02:58:14.042 --> 02:58:20.066]  So what I don't understand is why the Iranians don't just call our bluff.
[02:58:20.066 --> 02:58:22.787]  Why they don't just... Listen, listen, listen.
[02:58:22.787 --> 02:58:27.811]  Five years ago, they had a soft line guy in there who had all the inspectors in.
[02:58:27.811 --> 02:58:30.913]  The UN said no one had ever allowed this level of inspection.
[02:58:30.913 --> 02:58:32.854]  They need reactors.
[02:58:32.854 --> 02:58:34.875]  They can only refine half the oil they need.
[02:58:34.875 --> 02:58:37.737]  I mean, they really want a peaceful program.
[02:58:43.012 --> 02:58:45.640]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:58:50.526 --> 02:58:55.069]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:58:55.069 --> 02:58:55.990]  Number 1.
[02:58:55.990 --> 02:58:59.412]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:58:59.412 --> 02:59:00.273]  Number 2.
[02:59:00.273 --> 02:59:05.176]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:59:05.176 --> 02:59:05.916]  It's true.
[02:59:05.916 --> 02:59:10.780]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:59:10.780 --> 02:59:11.620]  Number 3.
[02:59:11.620 --> 02:59:15.202]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:59:15.202 --> 02:59:18.885]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:59:19.105 --> 02:59:19.906]  Number 4.
[02:59:19.906 --> 02:59:22.668]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:59:22.668 --> 02:59:26.330]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:59:26.330 --> 02:59:27.131]  Number 5.
[02:59:27.131 --> 02:59:31.274]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:59:31.274 --> 02:59:36.037]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:59:36.317 --> 02:59:40.500]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:40.500 --> 02:59:42.281]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:42.281 --> 02:59:44.542]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:59:44.542 --> 02:59:47.144]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:59:47.144 --> 02:59:48.544]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:48.544 --> 02:59:54.708]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:10.788 --> 03:00:13.770]  All right, at the bottom of the hour, I got a big news blitz coming up.
[03:00:13.770 --> 03:00:19.113]  We're going to have the sheriff from Pinal County, Arizona, under siege with death threats.
[03:00:19.113 --> 03:00:28.179]  Coming up the next segment schedule, we had, of course, some other interesting guests on earlier in the transmission like Ted Nugent today.
[03:00:28.179 --> 03:00:30.881]  Last segment with Bob Chapman taking phone calls.
[03:00:30.881 --> 03:00:32.702]  Jamie in Ohio, you're on the air.
[03:00:32.702 --> 03:00:33.823]  Go ahead, quick question, Jamie.
[03:00:34.747 --> 03:00:38.250]  Hey, buddy, for one, I've got to say, liberty or death, my friend.
[03:00:38.250 --> 03:00:41.633]  You are a true patriot, and I appreciate you 100%.
[03:00:41.633 --> 03:00:43.814]  Well, I appreciate you.
[03:00:43.814 --> 03:00:52.061]  My thing is, you know, as to what we're talking about with all this that's going on with our borders and all that, you know, this is a strategic plan.
[03:00:52.061 --> 03:00:54.263]  Make no mistake about it, people.
[03:00:54.263 --> 03:00:55.864]  This is not an accident.
[03:00:55.864 --> 03:00:57.626]  This is an overthrow.
[03:00:57.626 --> 03:01:03.831]  This is to merge Mexico with Canada and the U.S., just like they set up back in the Bush administration.
[03:01:04.571 --> 03:01:07.092]  You know, and this is just a prelude of that.
[03:01:07.092 --> 03:01:10.393]  If you look at it logically, that's what's going on right now.
[03:01:10.393 --> 03:01:22.918]  They're holding back the people of Arizona, the great people trying to save themselves out there, holding them back, not allowing them to protect themselves, and putting a hole in their net there, you know, in our border.
[03:01:22.918 --> 03:01:25.699]  Putting a strategic hole in there to let them come in.
[03:01:25.699 --> 03:01:28.560]  Because that is the plan of this administration.
[03:01:29.239 --> 03:01:36.123]  And also, with what's going to go on with the National ID Card, they're going to end up instituting that under immigration laws, trust me.
[03:01:36.123 --> 03:01:36.943]  No, they've said that.
[03:01:36.943 --> 03:01:39.124]  I mean, we already have it as the National ID Card.
[03:01:39.124 --> 03:01:43.446]  You're just going to have to have it to have a job, and the illegals are all just going to be legalized.
[03:01:43.446 --> 03:01:44.247]  I mean, that's the plan.
[03:01:44.247 --> 03:01:47.288]  It does fix the problem, because no one is illegal.
[03:01:47.288 --> 03:01:52.631]  And then they come in, they all get welfare, and the country goes bankrupt, which is the strategic banking plan.
[03:01:52.631 --> 03:01:54.732]  Bob Chapman.
[03:01:54.732 --> 03:01:57.073]  Oh, I think you're both absolutely correct.
[03:01:57.845 --> 03:02:11.775]  And, uh, I see that they have a fund, uh, to help Arizona, uh, finance the, uh, challenge from the federal government on the, uh, legislative action that they took.
[03:02:11.775 --> 03:02:14.938]  Yeah, it raised a half a million dollars in one day.
[03:02:14.938 --> 03:02:15.778]  That's right.
[03:02:15.778 --> 03:02:21.022]  And, uh, I just put in my publication for tomorrow, if you can, help them.
[03:02:21.022 --> 03:02:25.325]  Uh, because, you know, they're standing in there for all Americans, 90% of Americans
[03:02:26.599 --> 03:02:35.004]  Are against what's going on, immigration, illegal immigration-wise in Washington, and everybody should give them their help.
[03:02:35.004 --> 03:02:35.844]  It's on the internet.
[03:02:35.844 --> 03:02:39.046]  I can't remember what the... Yeah, no, it's all over the news.
[03:02:39.046 --> 03:02:40.447]  The AP's reporting on it as well.
[03:02:40.447 --> 03:02:42.368]  I appreciate your call.
[03:02:42.368 --> 03:02:44.569]  Great points, Jamie.
[03:02:44.569 --> 03:02:45.350]  Last caller for Bob.
[03:02:45.350 --> 03:02:48.491]  I'll get to Wyatt and Brian before the show ends, if they can hold.
[03:02:48.491 --> 03:02:50.312]  Let's go to Mark in Pennsylvania.
[03:02:50.312 --> 03:02:51.293]  You're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[03:02:52.381 --> 03:02:53.681]  Thank you, thank you.
[03:02:53.681 --> 03:03:03.105]  I'd like to, uh, in response to you asked last week what people are going to do for the fourth, I cracked the books and I watched the video about John Adams.
[03:03:03.105 --> 03:03:04.826]  I went to Monticello.
[03:03:04.826 --> 03:03:05.506]  Okay.
[03:03:05.506 --> 03:03:06.906]  Jefferson was a genius.
[03:03:06.906 --> 03:03:11.648]  The deal about them, if they take over the money, it's more powerful than standing armies.
[03:03:11.648 --> 03:03:17.690]  Uh, not long ago, I recently met a man who works at the Mint.
[03:03:17.690 --> 03:03:21.712]  I don't know if Bob Chapman is aware of this, but our mint, our mints,
[03:03:22.319 --> 03:03:26.402]  Actually make more than just the American dollar.
[03:03:26.402 --> 03:03:32.147]  They print and mint coins and dollars for different countries around the world.
[03:03:32.147 --> 03:03:41.114]  So there's all this talk about the budget this, the budget that, the amount of money they spend here and that's a lot of drama because for these guys, for these tyrants,
[03:03:41.775 --> 03:03:43.897]  They have Aladdin's Lamp.
[03:03:43.897 --> 03:03:46.259]  They have as much funny money as they want to print.
[03:03:46.259 --> 03:03:47.620]  That's a great analogy!
[03:03:47.620 --> 03:03:53.364]  And they sell us stuff that they know is worthless to destroy us, and we have their own documents!
[03:03:53.364 --> 03:03:54.205]  And that's a great point!
[03:03:54.205 --> 03:03:56.847]  They have Aladdin's Lamp, and it's a fraud!
[03:03:56.847 --> 03:03:59.909]  I mean, like, Madoff sold a hundred and something billion of fake stuff.
[03:03:59.909 --> 03:04:05.374]  These guys sell thousands of trillions of fake stuff, and we just bow down and say, everything's yours!
[03:04:05.374 --> 03:04:08.056]  Bob Chapman comments on that great point.
[03:04:08.056 --> 03:04:10.898]  Boy, I love it, and when I heard him say it,
[03:04:11.411 --> 03:04:13.492]  It just clicked like it did for you.
[03:04:13.492 --> 03:04:23.999]  But there are a number of mints throughout the world who specialize in making currencies, both in coin as well as paper, for many other countries.
[03:04:23.999 --> 03:04:32.444]  So it's not unusual for a large mint to make specie for other countries.
[03:04:32.444 --> 03:04:33.285]  Alright, we're out of time.
[03:04:33.285 --> 03:04:36.286]  Bob, I look forward to seeing you again next week.
[03:04:36.286 --> 03:04:38.147]  Watch your six, and I know I will as well.
[03:04:38.147 --> 03:04:38.628]  God bless you.
[03:04:39.787 --> 03:04:40.387]  Same to you.
[03:04:40.387 --> 03:04:41.849]  And thanks y'all for listening.
[03:04:41.849 --> 03:04:42.149]  You bet.
[03:04:42.149 --> 03:04:42.629]  Thank you.
[03:04:42.629 --> 03:04:48.954]  We've got Sheriff Paul Babiou, Pinal County, Arizona Sheriff, joining us.
[03:04:48.954 --> 03:04:51.976]  Coming up, a ton of news and your phone call straight ahead.
[03:04:51.976 --> 03:04:52.316]  1-800-259-9231.
[03:04:52.316 --> 03:04:54.558]  We'll be right back on this Live Friday edition.
[03:04:54.558 --> 03:04:55.018]  Final hour.
[03:05:00.845 --> 03:05:02.486]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[03:05:02.486 --> 03:05:05.869]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.
[03:05:05.869 --> 03:05:11.073]  This is an American made product of the highest quality and compares to nothing you will find in stores.
[03:05:11.073 --> 03:05:14.516]  You can buy factory direct, shipped via UPS right to your door.
[03:05:14.516 --> 03:05:16.858]  Check them out on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[03:05:17.498 --> 03:05:21.021]  Or call 800-340-7091.
[03:05:21.021 --> 03:05:22.162]  Take my word for it.
[03:05:22.162 --> 03:05:24.824]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[03:05:24.824 --> 03:05:31.330]  Since 1947, Calbin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[03:05:31.330 --> 03:05:32.831]  Buy American and stay clean.

[03:05:36.134 --> 03:05:36.534]  Or call 1-800-340-7091.
[03:05:36.534 --> 03:05:37.875]  Well, Marty, what do you have to say?
[03:05:41.158 --> 03:05:49.084]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, satisfaction is guaranteed on W Dirtback.
[03:05:49.084 --> 03:05:53.207]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 for a free catalog or visit our website 5starsoap.com.
[03:05:53.207 --> 03:05:54.028]  Thank you!
[03:06:00.526 --> 03:06:02.887]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[03:06:02.887 --> 03:06:05.208]  We are part of a New World Order.
[03:06:05.208 --> 03:06:08.429]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[03:06:08.429 --> 03:06:13.531]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:06:13.531 --> 03:06:18.052]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:06:18.052 --> 03:06:20.393]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:06:20.393 --> 03:06:22.934]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:06:22.934 --> 03:06:25.795]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:06:26.195 --> 03:06:33.782]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:06:34.133 --> 03:06:39.515]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:06:39.515 --> 03:06:41.835]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:06:41.835 --> 03:06:46.056]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:06:46.056 --> 03:06:47.117]  And I got news for you.
[03:06:47.117 --> 03:06:48.457]  You're everyone else.
[03:06:48.457 --> 03:06:49.958]  Invisible Empire.

[03:07:00.404 --> 03:07:01.165]  Listen up, folks.
[03:07:01.165 --> 03:07:02.105]  This is important.
[03:07:02.105 --> 03:07:03.206]  Alex Jones here.
[03:07:03.206 --> 03:07:11.553]  Now you can get free shipping on the storable, easy-to-fix, delicious food from efoodsdirect.com from July 4th through July 14th.

[03:07:17.397 --> 03:07:19.379]  So we all need to get as much food as we can.
[03:07:19.719 --> 03:07:22.881]  Every one of you needs to buy as much storable food as possible.
[03:07:22.881 --> 03:07:28.045]  This is the perfect time to do just that with eFoodsDirect and take advantage of their free shipping special.

[03:08:02.751 --> 03:08:09.378]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:09.378 --> 03:08:12.380]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:17.009 --> 03:08:18.150]  Corey, thank you.
[03:08:18.150 --> 03:08:18.870]  531 in the border battle.
[03:08:18.870 --> 03:08:25.273]  The Badal County Sheriff has been receiving death threats because of his support for the law, for the immigration law.
[03:08:25.273 --> 03:08:34.638]  Sheriff Paul Babu's office confirms he's received death threats from the Mexican Mafia and from the drug cartels.
[03:08:34.638 --> 03:08:39.261]  Outside law enforcement teams investigated the threats and found they are credible.
[03:08:39.261 --> 03:08:45.604]  Despite it all, Babu has declined a personal security detail because he says the county's resources are stretched thin.
[03:08:46.434 --> 03:08:53.516]  He says they don't change his support of law and demands for President Obama to secure the border.
[03:08:53.516 --> 03:08:59.978]  His office says they have information that the gangs have placed a green light on Babu's life.
[03:08:59.978 --> 03:09:05.459]  Babu says he's always armed and is always aware of his surroundings.
[03:09:05.459 --> 03:09:07.140]  Imagine this, my friends.
[03:09:07.140 --> 03:09:11.641]  Here in the United States, we are putting up with this.
[03:09:11.641 --> 03:09:14.902]  And we have a president who, on record,
[03:09:16.212 --> 03:09:21.253]  has sued Arizona when clearly this law is constitutional.
[03:09:21.253 --> 03:09:22.733]  The media has lied.
[03:09:22.733 --> 03:09:23.514]  Another hoax.
[03:09:23.514 --> 03:09:26.094]  Just like they said Rand Paul was against the Civil Rights Act.
[03:09:26.094 --> 03:09:27.734]  Never said that.
[03:09:27.734 --> 03:09:30.355]  He was on the satellite going, excuse me?
[03:09:30.355 --> 03:09:31.915]  Hold on, I can't hear you.
[03:09:31.915 --> 03:09:32.595]  Yes?
[03:09:32.595 --> 03:09:34.796]  No, I'm not for getting rid of it.
[03:09:34.796 --> 03:09:36.816]  And they said, oh, he said yes.
[03:09:36.816 --> 03:09:38.977]  Total manipulation.
[03:09:38.977 --> 03:09:40.517]  Just like when somebody calls and says, can you hear me?
[03:09:40.517 --> 03:09:40.817]  Yes?
[03:09:40.817 --> 03:09:43.198]  And it's the same thing.
[03:09:43.198 --> 03:09:44.158]  I've read the law on air.
[03:09:44.158 --> 03:09:45.218]  I've read the subsections.
[03:09:46.938 --> 03:10:02.419]  All it says, all it states, on record, is that if they pull an illegal alien over for something else, and they're an illegal alien, they'll be arrested.
[03:10:05.239 --> 03:10:08.540]  It's incredible, and it is an act of treason by the federal government.
[03:10:08.540 --> 03:10:11.921]  But the federal government is controlled by offshore corporations.
[03:10:11.921 --> 03:10:13.601]  They want a North American Union.
[03:10:13.601 --> 03:10:18.302]  They want to get rid of our borders, and our laws, and our liberties, our freedoms.
[03:10:18.302 --> 03:10:19.983]  This is what's happening.
[03:10:19.983 --> 03:10:24.144]  The sheriff was scheduled to call in right about now, but we always have time zone issues.
[03:10:24.144 --> 03:10:25.924]  Arizona doesn't even follow the time zone system.
[03:10:25.924 --> 03:10:30.925]  Oh, he's in a security meeting.
[03:10:30.925 --> 03:10:32.226]  We just found out.
[03:10:32.226 --> 03:10:33.286]  Well, good, because I didn't know that.
[03:10:34.502 --> 03:10:35.043]  Yes, I have a question.
[03:10:35.043 --> 03:10:37.705]  What's the best way to overall resist the New World Order?
[03:10:59.195 --> 03:11:11.051]  The overall best way to resist the New World Order is to always be conscious of the fact that human history is about a struggle against tyranny and oppressors and the corrupt, and that we need to be informed.
[03:11:11.051 --> 03:11:13.755]  Like the Bible says, the people perish for lack of knowledge.
[03:11:13.755 --> 03:11:15.457]  We need to be informed and involved.
[03:11:16.098 --> 03:11:24.379]  And we need to work with and form alliances with people that want liberty and freedom, and we need to promote the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[03:11:24.379 --> 03:11:26.260]  Wyatt, I appreciate your call.
[03:11:26.260 --> 03:11:27.940]  I mean, it's a lifestyle of liberty.
[03:11:27.940 --> 03:11:30.400]  It's a lifestyle of freedom.
[03:11:30.400 --> 03:11:37.782]  And we've gone through thousands of years of history experiencing different forms of governments, and our founders created the best system in world history.
[03:11:37.782 --> 03:11:44.683]  And that's why the globalists and others want to get rid of it, because they want to create the world in their image, not in an image of liberty and freedom.
[03:11:47.042 --> 03:11:48.226]  Well, my friends, uh...
[03:11:49.960 --> 03:11:54.441]  For the last few days, we've talked about the news headlines coming out of Arizona.
[03:11:54.441 --> 03:11:59.083]  Mexican drug cartel sends death threats to Arizona County Sheriff.
[03:11:59.083 --> 03:12:01.504]  And he does now have time to join us.
[03:12:01.504 --> 03:12:03.144]  We appreciate him coming on.
[03:12:03.144 --> 03:12:09.766]  Sheriff Paul Babiou, Pinal County, Arizona, who has been issued death threats.
[03:12:09.766 --> 03:12:11.527]  There's a, I guess, a hit out for him.
[03:12:11.527 --> 03:12:14.948]  We should take the Mexican mafia and others serious at their word.
[03:12:14.948 --> 03:12:18.349]  They've killed thousands of police and military in
[03:12:19.429 --> 03:12:28.351]  Mexico and he is right down there on the border upwards of 80 miles now off limits to citizens and he's been begging for aid from the federal government.
[03:12:28.351 --> 03:12:35.872]  The federal government has responded by trying to block the state from even being able to ask an illegal alien, if they're an illegal alien, when they pull them over for drunk driving.
[03:12:35.872 --> 03:12:37.632]  So this is treason in my opinion.
[03:12:37.632 --> 03:12:39.153]  Sheriff, thanks for coming on.
[03:12:39.153 --> 03:12:40.533]  Alex, thanks for having me on.
[03:12:40.533 --> 03:12:41.773]  I appreciate it.
[03:12:41.773 --> 03:12:45.034]  I know you've got a lot going on and I just had a security meeting.
[03:12:45.034 --> 03:12:46.554]  Let's talk about the
[03:12:48.117 --> 03:12:51.624]  The death threats against you and the serious escalation.
[03:12:51.624 --> 03:12:56.172]  Let's talk about the situation that is happening there on the ground in Arizona.
[03:12:56.738 --> 03:13:08.827]  Well, particular to the threats, we get a lot of fan mail, some of it not so pleasant, from our own citizens, some who disagree and make threats and aggressive statements.
[03:13:08.827 --> 03:13:10.208]  That's one thing.
[03:13:10.208 --> 03:13:19.495]  And some people could get mad at an elected official for raising their taxes or changing an ordinance, but entirely different when you have foreign-born criminals
[03:13:20.359 --> 03:13:26.102]  Mexican mafia, drug cartel members that try to bring their trash here to America.
[03:13:26.102 --> 03:13:37.907]  The same stuff that goes on down in Mexico, literally a narco-terrorist state where they kill in broad daylight police chiefs and then take out their family and set it up as an example.
[03:13:37.907 --> 03:13:40.928]  You mess with us, this is what's going to happen to you.
[03:13:40.928 --> 03:13:47.071]  And only three weeks ago they assassinated what would have been the elected governor of a state down there.
[03:13:47.071 --> 03:13:47.371]  Crazy.
[03:13:48.709 --> 03:13:50.850]  And you're not joking around about this.
[03:13:50.850 --> 03:13:54.872]  I live in Texas, and I remember citizens being kidnapped on our side of the border.
[03:13:54.872 --> 03:14:01.494]  I've had sheriffs on where three to six miles in different cases, Mexican military will come across.
[03:14:01.494 --> 03:14:11.679]  If they've caught on a major highway a drug shipment, the Mexican troops come across, surround two lone policemen or sheriff's deputies with machine guns and rob them.
[03:14:11.679 --> 03:14:14.800]  I mean, that was going on four or five years ago I was interviewing these people.
[03:14:15.100 --> 03:14:15.240]  That's
[03:14:30.442 --> 03:14:31.002]  I don't know.
[03:14:51.089 --> 03:14:54.590]  We're about 80 miles north of the Mexican-U.S.
[03:14:54.590 --> 03:15:05.813]  border, and we're not obviously a border county, yet what we're experiencing here on a daily basis is approximately 2,000-plus illegals that come through our county.
[03:15:05.813 --> 03:15:18.176]  You're talking the Border Patrol, who apprehended 200 and approximately 50,000 illegals last year, which most of them, they just do catch and release and send them back with no punishment, shower or meal.
[03:15:18.756 --> 03:15:22.159]  And to the border, ready to try the next day.
[03:15:22.159 --> 03:15:28.605]  But that's only one of 2.6 that they say actually get in here.
[03:15:28.605 --> 03:15:31.688]  So they're talking 600,000 that come in here.
[03:15:31.688 --> 03:15:36.992]  Other people have it estimated more at like a million a year, just in Arizona.
[03:15:36.992 --> 03:15:42.197]  That's why we're screaming bloody murder, saying, Mr. President Obama, do your job.
[03:15:42.797 --> 03:15:57.123]  Secure the border and here he's in Washington high-fiving with Calderon in front of Congress and half of these all these Democrats stand up give him a standing ovation in our country as they're kicking us in the chops undermining the rule of law.
[03:15:57.123 --> 03:16:06.907]  The president should send 3,000 soldiers to our borders to secure the border and meanwhile he sends a team of lawyers with the ACLU to take us to drag us into court.
[03:16:07.447 --> 03:16:08.908]  And this is outrageous.
[03:16:08.908 --> 03:16:09.308]  Why?
[03:16:09.308 --> 03:16:23.434]  Because in my county, 80 miles north of the border, in the heart of Arizona, we have paramilitary squads with automatic weapons that are escorting these drugs up here, and they're bringing this violence into Arizona.
[03:16:23.434 --> 03:16:29.677]  We just had a gunfight out there with a competing cartel, and two of these smugglers were killed.
[03:16:29.677 --> 03:16:30.798]  And they call us for help.
[03:16:32.570 --> 03:16:44.831]  And they knew exactly where our deputy three weeks before was ambushed by six of these smugglers and triangulated him and put him in a kill zone and tried to kill him.
[03:16:46.128 --> 03:16:48.410]  And our deputy was shot.
[03:16:48.410 --> 03:17:11.126]  So here, what we have, the reaction is, just as you mentioned, they put up billboard-sized signs that say, danger, warning, stay out, drug and human smuggling, narco, all this different language on these boards, and that's their answer, is to throw up their hands and defeat, saying we can't secure the border, and this is simply outrageous.
[03:17:11.186 --> 03:17:27.374]  Sheriff, roughly what percentage, because I've seen as much as a third on national news being quoted, but roughly what percentage of the great state of Arizona bordering Mexico is now being denied to law-abiding citizens and losing its property values?
[03:17:27.374 --> 03:17:31.736]  Because the reports I've seen is that this is going on past Tucson, 80 plus miles in.
[03:17:32.702 --> 03:17:33.883]  It is.
[03:17:33.883 --> 03:17:38.045]  There's approximately 2,000 miles of the border from California to Texas.
[03:17:38.045 --> 03:17:42.066]  We have 376 of those miles in Arizona.
[03:17:42.066 --> 03:17:49.270]  There's portions directly on the border that are off-limits, but then you have areas, and it's hard to put an actual
[03:17:50.214 --> 03:17:54.877]  How many miles or acres are under control?
[03:17:54.877 --> 03:17:58.519]  But I can tell you this, they have unfettered access.
[03:17:58.519 --> 03:18:05.784]  So a third is basically Wild Wild West and it's denying safety and security to around a third of the state.
[03:18:07.691 --> 03:18:16.913]  We live in a sense, in certain parts of Arizona, in lawlessness, where these people come in and think that they own this area.
[03:18:16.913 --> 03:18:32.176]  And then the crimes that are committed, not just against our citizens, which we've got to stop, but what about, where's the outrage from all these human rights advocates for these people that are being brought here, who do want a better life, although it's illegal.
[03:18:33.036 --> 03:18:38.898]  That we become the kidnapped capital of America last year, second in the world only to Mexico City.
[03:18:38.898 --> 03:18:45.921]  You know, and the President says this lie that somehow our border is secure more than it's ever been.
[03:18:45.921 --> 03:18:48.201]  This is craziness.
[03:18:48.201 --> 03:18:51.182]  Did you see Congressman Stark say the border is quite secure?
[03:18:51.182 --> 03:18:52.943]  Yeah.
[03:18:54.074 --> 03:19:00.281]  These people are delirious, you know, not even knowing what we're facing, what we're dealing with.
[03:19:00.281 --> 03:19:06.568]  And, you know, here, and I served in Iraq in the Army National Guard, still in today.
[03:19:06.568 --> 03:19:10.892]  I don't speak for the military, but I can tell you, we've been there nine years now.
[03:19:10.892 --> 03:19:14.677]  We spent 750 plus billion dollars with a B.
[03:19:15.649 --> 03:19:18.991]  Over 4,000 of our American heroes have been killed there.
[03:19:18.991 --> 03:19:25.735]  And we can fight wars and liberate countries, stabilize them, all in the sake of democracy and to keep the enemies away.
[03:19:25.735 --> 03:19:26.975]  I get all that.
[03:19:26.975 --> 03:19:34.839]  But we can't even secure our international border when we have hundreds of thousands of people that enter our country, but you don't even know who they are?
[03:19:34.839 --> 03:19:42.524]  We don't have a country if we don't have a border, and Mexico's got some of the most draconian laws for illegals, and we basically have none.
[03:19:42.524 --> 03:19:43.124]  Stay there, sir.
[03:19:43.124 --> 03:19:43.784]  We've got to go to break.
[03:19:43.784 --> 03:19:44.925]  I want to come back and talk about the
[03:19:45.365 --> 03:19:45.565]  I think?
