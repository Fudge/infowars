[00:40.560 --> 00:44.920]  years or so he's gonna be popping in I've been a few years since I talked to Ted
[00:44.920 --> 00:49.720]  he's gonna be on coming up the middle of the next hour then our weekly visit with
[00:49.720 --> 00:54.080]  Bob Chapman to cover all the things happening in the economy and Sheriff
[00:54.080 --> 00:58.560]  Babu is also going to be on he's been begging for help from the federal
[00:58.560 --> 01:04.160]  government and he has of course a Mexican mafia hit out on him which is very
[01:04.160 --> 01:08.560]  very serious and we had more sheriffs like Sheriff Babu we could save this
[01:08.560 --> 01:13.960]  country so I will take you to Arizona where they're literally under siege by
[01:13.960 --> 01:18.400]  the coyotes the drug runners and the criminal treasonous treacherous federal
[01:18.400 --> 01:22.320]  government that is coming up as well today so Ted Nugent Bob Chapman and
[01:22.320 --> 01:30.160]  Sheriff Babu joining us from Arizona we've got a message to Arizona help is
[01:30.160 --> 01:36.800]  on the way remember Arizona remember Goliad remember the Alamo we're going
[01:36.800 --> 01:40.920]  to defend this Republic it isn't perfect but it's the best thing we've got
[01:40.920 --> 01:44.840]  that's why the globalists want to destroy it and it in the globalists are
[01:44.840 --> 01:48.960]  trying to wreck we've got to defend they want our guns we got to keep them they
[01:48.960 --> 01:51.800]  want to get rid of our borders we got to defend them they want to get rid of the
[01:51.800 --> 01:55.960]  dollar we got to save it it's very very simple they want our wrecked state
[01:55.960 --> 02:00.560]  income taxes we've got to beat it they want to put fluoride in the water we
[02:00.560 --> 02:04.040]  got to get it out of there because every time you research what they want
[02:04.040 --> 02:10.160]  it's bad for us it's bad for humanity they want to take babies blood secretly
[02:10.160 --> 02:14.720]  at birth for DNA databases we've got to block it you believe they've admitted
[02:14.720 --> 02:18.680]  they're doing this now after decades of denial caught red-handed and they just
[02:18.680 --> 02:22.520]  go well we still are going to take it at birth and keep it and that's just the
[02:22.520 --> 02:27.080]  way it is we'll call the CPS on you when your child's born I remember when my
[02:27.080 --> 02:29.840]  first child was born I said you know that blood you're taking goes to a DNA
[02:29.840 --> 02:33.640]  database of course the nurses all knew it they said it doesn't matter we've got
[02:33.640 --> 02:36.200]  to test for diseases and I said why don't you test here at the hospital it
[02:36.200 --> 02:39.800]  goes to the health department goes to the Pentagon well wherever it goes this is
[02:39.800 --> 02:45.000]  state law and I said no it's not it's state policy you're not keeping the
[02:45.000 --> 02:53.600]  blood but one time we had a little bit of a sick baby at birth and I wouldn't
[02:53.600 --> 02:56.360]  even think about it before they slurped the blood out and ran off with it
[02:56.360 --> 03:02.800]  giggling down the hallway literally I was like after it happened I was like
[03:02.800 --> 03:10.320]  huh but that's how all this creeping death works ladies and gentlemen is it
[03:10.320 --> 03:14.240]  just goes on in the background when you're not noticing it's just standard
[03:14.240 --> 03:18.920]  procedures that nobody really worries about nobody looks under the hood nobody
[03:18.920 --> 03:24.320]  looks in the trunk nobody looks under their fingernails nobody pulls a piece
[03:24.320 --> 03:28.240]  of paneling off the old farmhouse to see what's behind it you pull it off its
[03:28.240 --> 03:33.640]  termites and roaches and ants this country is rotten from head to toe we've
[03:33.640 --> 03:38.560]  still got a chance to save it if we get off off of our gigantic butts now and
[03:38.560 --> 03:46.920]  I'm talking about myself as well the good news is and I'm not gonna belabor it
[03:46.920 --> 03:51.960]  but I have been offered by heavy hitters three different reality TV shows the
[03:51.960 --> 03:58.280]  last year and I've said no just because I think it's the offers are basically to
[03:58.280 --> 04:01.760]  spin what we do and make us look foolish so I've said no even though that would
[04:01.760 --> 04:07.120]  launch us at a new level and I've been approached of course about television in
[04:07.120 --> 04:12.760]  the news format and I always tell these places yeah you let me go on and say
[04:12.760 --> 04:18.120]  what I want and have for freehand I'll do it but not if I have to change who I
[04:18.120 --> 04:23.440]  am and of course the offers is withdrawn but that's an indicator of how
[04:23.440 --> 04:28.800]  important this radio show is and how effective it is and the fact that it's
[04:28.800 --> 04:32.640]  reaching millions of new people a week I mean look at the drudge report today

[05:04.400 --> 05:08.640]  lungs generator now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and
[05:08.640 --> 05:12.960]  deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution
[05:12.960 --> 05:16.800]  through the lungs the respiratory system is the first line of defense for
[05:16.800 --> 05:21.160]  airborne pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the
[05:21.160 --> 05:25.320]  respiratory system with your self-produced nano silver solutions and
[05:25.320 --> 05:30.640]  also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream with
[05:30.640 --> 05:34.840]  continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products you can
[05:34.840 --> 05:39.480]  now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator
[05:39.480 --> 05:43.640]  very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided making

[08:29.640 --> 08:39.840]  read to you some of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 stacks 11 stacks of news that I'm
[08:39.840 --> 08:46.480]  going to try to at least scan over all of it to detail and mine down into some of
[08:46.480 --> 08:50.840]  it there's no way to cover it all Ted Nugent coming up an hour and 22 minutes
[08:50.840 --> 08:56.160]  from now a bob Chapman popping in and Sheriff Babu from out in Arizona who's
[08:56.160 --> 09:00.480]  been begging for help putting on an SOS and we got news for you Sheriff Texas is
[09:00.480 --> 09:05.920]  on the way so that is coming up as well in the last hour this is what's in our
[09:05.920 --> 09:11.760]  stack california transit cop verdict sparks looting I wouldn't really call
[09:11.760 --> 09:17.960]  this looting I'd call it anger and rioting and I'm sorry ladies and gentlemen
[09:17.960 --> 09:23.520]  we've seen what happened with this first the police seized no fewer than five
[09:23.520 --> 09:28.040]  cell phones off of people on the platform and then they lied about it
[09:28.040 --> 09:35.360]  they're in the Bay Area on the train platform one of the subway entrances and
[09:35.360 --> 09:39.400]  they lied about it and said that he had scuffled and fought and tried to disarm
[09:39.400 --> 09:43.720]  the officers of the officer and self-defense had done it now there
[09:43.720 --> 09:48.800]  were a whole parcel of cops there were four police on that platform more than
[09:48.800 --> 09:53.160]  50 that showed up after the shooting and they seemed to wait to get him on a
[09:53.160 --> 09:57.800]  stretcher close to a half hour and he died on his way to the hospital in fact
[09:57.800 --> 10:00.440]  he was moving his arms and stuff when they finally got him on the ambulance
[10:00.440 --> 10:06.400]  I've watched the footage we've covered it extensively and they killed him and I
[10:06.400 --> 10:10.560]  guess the word was look don't save this guy he'll have a bigger lawsuit let him
[10:10.560 --> 10:15.320]  die because they they thought they grabbed all the video cameras they didn't
[10:15.320 --> 10:18.480]  want to have him talking saying look I was in handcuffs when they shot me in
[10:18.480 --> 10:22.040]  the back they said no he attacked the officer tried to disarm him this brave
[10:22.040 --> 10:27.240]  hero did what he had to fight in this evil person remember that we heard that
[10:27.240 --> 10:34.040]  the first five or six days and then the footage came out then the footage came
[10:34.040 --> 10:40.120]  out somebody on a train rolling by had stopped they hadn't thought to stop that
[10:40.120 --> 10:44.680]  train and go on board and get the cell phone cameras and they put him in
[10:44.680 --> 10:48.480]  handcuffs and he wasn't resistant and they were jumping on his head and having
[10:48.480 --> 10:52.200]  a bully party and getting off on it because they were cowards a real man
[10:52.200 --> 10:56.400]  wouldn't beat somebody up who was handcuffed I mean that's just basic
[10:56.400 --> 11:01.240]  chivalry I can't even get my blood up if some little guy starts a fight with
[11:01.240 --> 11:05.040]  me but I go crazy when some giant gets in my face I'm just ready to crawl all
[11:05.040 --> 11:08.280]  over I'm ready to pound him into the ground I mean that's what a real man
[11:08.280 --> 11:12.040]  is into and I'm not claiming I'm the toughest guy in the world but I'm red
[11:12.040 --> 11:16.680]  blooded only time I've had my butt whooped is when I fought somebody
[11:16.680 --> 11:22.000]  littler than me but no these guys like to get a guy in handcuffs and jump all
[11:22.000 --> 11:26.320]  over and put their knees on his head and hop on him and then the cop pulled out
[11:26.320 --> 11:30.760]  his gun chambered around and shot him right in the back then they even beat
[11:30.760 --> 11:34.840]  him up a little more a little more celebration I've seen pro-lifers having
[11:34.840 --> 11:40.360]  their arms broken it's in the extras of martial law 911 rise the police state
[11:40.360 --> 11:45.440]  in my 2005 film came out five years ago and it shows pro-lifers sitting
[11:45.440 --> 11:49.040]  peacefully on the sidewalk and police get their arms and num chucks and twist
[11:49.040 --> 11:52.400]  them and break them till bones stick out the side with compound fractures and
[11:52.400 --> 11:55.880]  then the cops come over with Billy clubs with pleasure and start beating them
[11:55.880 --> 12:00.320]  afterwards it's like you know it's kind of like a wolf when one wolf finally
[12:00.320 --> 12:03.880]  gets his teeth up underneath the udders of a cow and rips it up and they go for
[12:03.880 --> 12:08.120]  whatever soft first and the blood flows and the wolves just just just rush in
[12:08.120 --> 12:12.320]  and it's just wild they grab the cow by the snout and start pulling it they hit
[12:12.320 --> 12:15.760]  its tail its hind corners they twist it over get it on the ground and then go
[12:15.760 --> 12:20.120]  right into the throat right into the guts but it's even better when a cow gets
[12:20.120 --> 12:25.520]  stuck in the mud at a cow pond with wolves or coyotes they like to start at
[12:25.520 --> 12:29.560]  the end as a cow's front feet will get stuck in they take their time you'll
[12:29.560 --> 12:33.600]  find cows half eaten still alive and those wolves and cows just love it and
[12:33.600 --> 12:38.160]  see we're the prey now in America with evil police not all police are bad not
[12:38.160 --> 12:41.480]  all agencies have been turned to evil but they're slowly twisting them towards
[12:41.480 --> 12:45.680]  the dark side right now and it's a predatory thing I've seen I've seen
[12:45.680 --> 12:50.960]  multiple tapes of men without legs or men who are paralyzed and the cops can see
[12:50.960 --> 12:55.680]  they have shriveled atrophied legs and they come over to him on the sidewalk or
[12:55.680 --> 12:59.880]  at a jail you've seen all the cases and they tell them get up and walk it says
[12:59.880 --> 13:03.480]  this has happened out the TSA and they say sir I'm paralyzed and they say no
[13:03.480 --> 13:08.040]  you're not and then they throw them out of the wheelchair and of course these
[13:08.040 --> 13:13.040]  people have been paralyzed for decades their bones are soft their the muscles
[13:13.040 --> 13:16.920]  all pull off the bone their legs break and then the cops just come over or
[13:16.920 --> 13:20.600]  jail guards come over and just have another little satisfied beating there's
[13:20.600 --> 13:24.800]  nothing like beating on a man who can't walk or a woman who can't walk with a
[13:24.800 --> 13:30.480]  billy club yet for a wolf coward there's some kind of serious pleasure in that
[13:30.480 --> 13:33.680]  let me tell you something red blooded americans see that and it makes us want
[13:33.680 --> 13:46.160]  to throw up it makes us want to puke so so one of my listeners posted comments
[13:46.160 --> 13:53.840]  on info wars.com with this killer cop and he's now convicted this killer cops
[13:53.840 --> 13:58.720]  address and family instead go after him and of course we have happened to come
[13:58.720 --> 14:02.040]  across as our moderators have pulled it down but not before it was up for a day
[14:02.040 --> 14:08.320]  and the FBI came here secret service all this other business had to secret
[14:08.320 --> 14:13.440]  services another case FBI came here with subpoenas for those IP addresses they
[14:13.440 --> 14:16.920]  went and arrested the poor fool that did it and of course it was literally a
[14:16.920 --> 14:21.840]  convicted pothead with a bunch of pot who was just an armchair quarterback
[14:21.840 --> 14:25.600]  sitting there at his keyboard feeling powerful that's another form of coward we
[14:25.600 --> 14:33.120]  see out there and he see I said I've got 11 stacks of news and I just hit the
[14:33.120 --> 14:38.000]  very first article I've already spent eight nine minutes on this the point is
[14:38.000 --> 14:41.000]  I've been intimately involved in this case and we've covered it in great detail
[14:41.000 --> 14:46.400]  and the police weren't arrested this guy and he's serving a longer sentence more
[14:46.400 --> 14:50.280]  than a 10-year sentence for threatening to kill that cop and it was wrong to
[14:50.280 --> 14:53.680]  threaten to kill the cop it was wrong to threaten to kill his family as some
[14:53.680 --> 14:57.000]  other people did that is really cowardly and pathetic and no matter how bad this
[14:57.000 --> 15:01.680]  nutcase power tripping thug cop is his family doesn't deserve to be threatened
[15:01.680 --> 15:05.620]  you'll keep people's families out of it that's another rule of chivalry and they
[15:05.620 --> 15:08.440]  came up with these ancient ideas that all cultures have had that have been
[15:08.440 --> 15:13.920]  civilized whether it was the Japanese samurai or the knights and ladies of old
[15:13.920 --> 15:18.320]  in Europe because you know men who are in battle do you don't want to have your
[15:18.320 --> 15:21.520]  family involved so it's like you don't mess with my family I don't mess with
[15:21.520 --> 15:26.800]  your family another rule but idiots don't follow that so they kill this poor
[15:26.800 --> 15:30.600]  fellow in cold blood shoot him in the back the bullet goes through his back
[15:30.600 --> 15:34.360]  bounces back up through into his heart they blasted him through his lungs it
[15:34.360 --> 15:38.200]  bounced off the concrete slapped up through his rib cage into his heart and
[15:38.200 --> 15:43.040]  the cops then on the video jump on him some more the media spends and says oh
[15:43.040 --> 15:46.960]  look at them helping him and then they hang around and take your time till he
[15:46.960 --> 15:52.040]  bleeds out and killing so they could frame him and say he was trying to
[15:52.040 --> 15:56.320]  attack the cops well sorry two separate videos one body doubt was somebody
[15:56.320 --> 16:00.120]  weighed on the platform about 60 yards away was smart enough to slip off as the
[16:00.120 --> 16:03.720]  cops started confiscating other people's and somebody on the train shot it two
[16:03.720 --> 16:09.400]  different unedited videos show the cold-blooded premeditated murder one
[16:09.400 --> 16:16.200]  capital premeditated murder what do they give this cop what second-degree
[16:16.200 --> 16:20.360]  manslaughter he's going to serve two to four years in jail and it's a state
[16:20.360 --> 16:25.440]  offense so he'll probably be in six months six months all those cops need to
[16:25.440 --> 16:29.960]  go to prison for aiding and abetting that murder by covering up the fact that
[16:29.960 --> 16:35.160]  he was murdered execution style in handcuffs all of them need to be charged
[16:35.160 --> 16:41.120]  as accessories to murder accessories to cold-blooded capital murder they need
[16:41.120 --> 16:46.040]  to spend life in prison and the cop that did this he needs to be sent up
[16:46.040 --> 16:50.360]  for death penalty let me tell you something he pulled that gun out and he
[16:50.360 --> 16:54.560]  killed him in cold blood and I've watched the video carefully some said well it
[16:54.560 --> 16:58.520]  was a taser he thought it was a taser and it was taser confusion and they have
[16:58.520 --> 17:03.480]  had cases where cops and drills have shot their own fellow officers in drills
[17:03.480 --> 17:07.320]  pulling a gun instead of a taser so now in training they never have a gun on
[17:07.320 --> 17:11.080]  their hip as well as the taser it's happened just a couple times no he
[17:11.080 --> 17:17.360]  pulled back he he he engaged it he knew the difference he had a psychopathic
[17:17.360 --> 17:21.560]  pleasure moment he was getting off on the adrenaline of jumping on an unarmed
[17:21.560 --> 17:26.760]  handcuffed man he was on a power trip like a mad dog wolf for a great white
[17:26.760 --> 17:29.800]  shark when you got a group of great whites in there and a feeding frenzy
[17:29.800 --> 17:33.280]  eating the carcass of a dead blue whale you ever seen that footage of whalers
[17:33.280 --> 17:36.520]  trying to get their blue whales up and a whole pack of great whites come in and
[17:36.520 --> 17:41.760]  they're just rolling and biting each other and killing each other never watched
[17:41.760 --> 17:48.640]  a group of mekos never watched a group of Greenland sharks going wild in a
[17:48.640 --> 17:53.440]  feeding frenzy on the carcass of a dead whale that's what it looks like and that
[17:53.440 --> 17:57.680]  guy's a murder an animal and he needs to go up for life in prison bare minimum oh
[17:57.680 --> 18:03.000]  but now the Justice Department's gonna save us the Justice Department's gonna
[18:03.000 --> 18:06.760]  come in and do a whitewash investigation as if the feds are saying hey Justice
[18:06.760 --> 18:10.000]  Department who's gonna investigate you for murder and those kids at Waco who's
[18:10.000 --> 18:13.320]  gonna investigate you for being big men pulling up in front of that church and
[18:13.320 --> 18:18.200]  opening fire on record first till the Davidian shot back and you ran off like
[18:18.200 --> 18:24.360]  a bunch of cowards you're a bunch of cowards you're a bunch of cowards we
[18:24.360 --> 18:29.160]  need lawmen like Sheriff Mack we don't need people like you we don't need
[18:29.160 --> 18:35.680]  cowards out there look at our sickening traitorous federal government won't send
[18:35.680 --> 18:39.400]  federal troops when that's in the Constitution down to Arizona and South
[18:39.400 --> 18:43.000]  Texas where law and order is completely collapsing Mexican troops are all
[18:43.000 --> 18:46.480]  across the border helicopter raids gun attacks police being killed
[18:46.480 --> 18:50.880]  citizens being kidnapped every day and it's barely a footnote in the news car
[18:50.880 --> 18:55.500]  bombing attacks whole neighborhoods being burned down I've seen a case of 12
[18:55.500 --> 19:00.800]  homes burning one night 14 and one night ranchers being murdered and every
[19:00.800 --> 19:05.400]  case I see the police turn and run every case I've seen Mexican troops come
[19:05.400 --> 19:08.560]  many miles over the border down rob police at gunpoint I wouldn't care if
[19:08.560 --> 19:12.480]  it was five Humvees against my one car I'll guarantee I jumped behind that car
[19:12.480 --> 19:15.960]  pull out my semi-automatic rifle if I was a cop and I'd go to war with those
[19:15.960 --> 19:19.840]  people I don't understand this compulsion to run where's your compulsion to fight
[19:19.840 --> 19:23.960]  what's wrong with people well I tell you it's what's in the water and it's on
[19:23.960 --> 19:27.920]  record just like Fox News reported last week Maryland's now banned that buys
[19:27.920 --> 19:31.440]  phenol a there's a bunch of other sub-chemicals that are known to
[19:31.440 --> 19:35.200]  sterilize and reduce men's testosterone we've been brain damage we've been
[19:35.200 --> 19:39.040]  sterilized we've been that's why that's why the most red-blooded fighting
[19:39.040 --> 19:42.440]  people in the world history have been turned into a bunch of gilded cowards
[19:42.440 --> 19:46.880]  Americans our ancestors whooped the British army the Empire that never been
[19:46.880 --> 19:51.360]  defeated by Nintendo one conservatively and now what have we turned into people
[19:51.360 --> 19:58.800]  that run from Mexican drug gangs cowards the ancestors of the it's makes me sick
[19:59.440 --> 20:03.680]  you worry but only because you're paying attention what's happening in the Gulf
[20:03.680 --> 20:08.280]  of Mexico illustrates an audacity toward nature a similar audacity called GMO or
[20:08.280 --> 20:11.800]  genetically modified organisms means that the quality of commercially grown
[20:11.800 --> 20:15.760]  food may be compromised with our health in the balance now that summer's here

[21:14.080 --> 21:21.600]  and a single rotating banner ad on prison planet dot com two years later we've
[21:21.600 --> 21:26.640]  sold over 40,000 pounds of heirloom seeds becoming the largest bulk seed

[21:52.520 --> 21:59.440]  Lipscomb and my company is survivalist seeds dot com
[21:59.440 --> 22:03.160]  hello Ted Anderson listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal
[22:03.160 --> 22:06.880]  Reserve note and understand the risks and deficit spending therefore with
[22:06.880 --> 22:10.560]  catastrophic events it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently
[22:10.560 --> 22:13.520]  placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their
[22:13.520 --> 22:17.280]  accounts a fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your
[22:17.280 --> 22:20.680]  deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal deficit spending will
[22:20.680 --> 22:24.200]  skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to ensure deposits
[22:24.200 --> 22:27.920]  during a bank run followed by a depressed economy a current effort is
[22:27.920 --> 22:31.840]  underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for
[22:31.840 --> 22:35.640]  depositors however an increase in money supply without equal expansion and
[22:35.640 --> 22:39.600]  productivity can cause inflation in order to achieve strength and stability
[22:39.600 --> 22:43.480]  I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly
[22:43.480 --> 22:47.600]  repositioned into gold and silver while paper investments currently have been
[22:47.600 --> 22:52.560]  driven by debt gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years for more

[24:14.960 --> 24:21.080]  what does that say about this Bay Area transit cop and his cohorts that they
[24:21.080 --> 24:26.680]  kill a guy in cold blood murder him execution style and then cover it up
[24:26.680 --> 24:31.320]  and I've watched the tapes I've read the reports they waited and let that guy
[24:31.320 --> 24:35.880]  die but if they go see a movie like Hurt Locker where they shoot terrorists and
[24:35.880 --> 24:39.520]  let them bleed to death it's kind of like oh we watched Hurt Locker you know
[24:39.520 --> 24:46.680]  he's a terrorist let him die or in Heartbreak Ridge sunny highway you know
[24:46.680 --> 24:50.440]  after he's wounded troops he executes them in the field that's what patriots
[24:50.440 --> 24:55.760]  do no it's not no it's not not unless that's what you want to happen to you
[24:55.760 --> 24:59.800]  there's a reason we have the Geneva Convention there's a reason we have
[24:59.800 --> 25:03.680]  common sense there's a reason we don't torture there's a reason we have due
[25:03.680 --> 25:07.080]  process there's a reason we have a bill of rights there's a reason we have
[25:07.080 --> 25:11.480]  private property because if we don't have these protections we got nothing
[25:11.480 --> 25:17.000]  every time in history we will be overtaken by scum by criminal groups that
[25:17.000 --> 25:22.720]  combine forces together to loot us there's no such thing as anarchy there's
[25:22.720 --> 25:27.840]  always groups of criminals that get together to rob others so patriots
[25:27.840 --> 25:31.880]  have to get together and agree upon a bill of rights and a constitution and a
[25:31.880 --> 25:38.080]  tiny limited government as a defense system against the invaders the corporate
[25:38.080 --> 25:42.680]  takeover artists are our main enemy today America is falling to a foreign
[25:42.680 --> 25:51.240]  corporate takeover right now California Transit Cop verdict sparks looting a
[25:51.240 --> 25:54.680]  white former transit police officer oh there were black officers that help with
[25:54.680 --> 25:59.440]  the cover up because it's a gang in about color they shoot white guys in the
[25:59.440 --> 26:03.960]  back all the time too a white former transit police officer was found guilty
[26:03.960 --> 26:07.920]  of a voluntary manslaughter in a videotape shooting death of an unarmed
[26:07.920 --> 26:12.440]  black man last year in Oakland California sparking a wave of looting and
[26:12.440 --> 26:19.240]  destruction in the city on Thursday evening the verdict prompted a peaceful
[26:19.240 --> 26:23.360]  protest by a thousand people in downtown Oakland which gave way over nightfall to
[26:23.360 --> 26:27.560]  some people looting stores smashing car windows throwing powerful fireworks at
[26:27.560 --> 26:31.520]  police and lighting fires and trash cans the police number in the hundreds
[26:31.520 --> 26:35.520]  made 50 arrests but local police expected the figure could double this is not
[26:35.520 --> 26:39.320]  the Wild Wild West Oakland police chief Anthony Bates told televised news
[26:39.320 --> 26:43.280]  conference this city will not tolerate this activity oh but you'll tolerate a
[26:43.280 --> 26:47.600]  psycho cop killing somebody in plain view and shooting them in the back when
[26:47.600 --> 26:51.680]  they're in handcuffs and then you'll let the other officers lie and signed fake
[26:51.680 --> 26:57.000]  police reports that he was resisting and wasn't in handcuffs and there was a
[26:57.000 --> 27:00.760]  the first report was he tried to get the gun you guys are all sitting on him
[27:00.760 --> 27:06.240]  part of your ego trip you were all squatting on him you were all jumping
[27:06.240 --> 27:10.480]  on his head you know full well you're a pack of liars your accessories to murder
[27:10.480 --> 27:14.680]  don't worry you got away with it though just like the fire and banks got away
[27:14.680 --> 27:18.840]  with destroying the country and I got news for you many of the California
[27:18.840 --> 27:21.720]  pension funds for police have already been pledged to the bankers so you'll
[27:21.720 --> 27:25.360]  be losing that directly as well so don't worry they're gonna get away with
[27:25.360 --> 27:28.880]  hurting you too you think you're the only one that gets away with being lawless
[27:28.880 --> 27:38.040]  oh no that's not how this works that's not how the universe works buddy boy I
[27:38.040 --> 27:43.000]  hate the lawlessness I hate that they have disgraced the uniform like this and
[27:43.000 --> 27:46.960]  they got happy to be able to report something like this this will just make
[27:46.960 --> 27:50.480]  the cops become more criminal more thuggish more sticking to themselves
[27:50.480 --> 27:55.560]  it's all part of the globalist plan I wish the cops would have sent this guy
[27:55.560 --> 27:58.760]  down the river I wish the police would have told the truth that day I wish this
[27:58.760 --> 28:01.960]  cop would have been in handcuffs within 30 minutes of this happening soon as
[28:01.960 --> 28:06.160]  they found but no no instead all over the country it's almost always an old man
[28:06.160 --> 28:09.960]  for some reason that makes the wolves and uniform go crazy it's cops that are
[28:09.960 --> 28:15.800]  making these decisions where some 82 84 92 I've interviewed some of them there
[28:15.800 --> 28:20.280]  was one yesterday we talked about in Colorado people come on his farm or
[28:20.280 --> 28:25.440]  robbing his vehicle try to run over him he shoots one the people admit they're
[28:25.440 --> 28:29.520]  stealing the thing they're illegal aliens and they release them and indict him
[28:29.520 --> 28:40.920]  for murder he's facing a murder charge murder charge not manslaughter but this
[28:40.920 --> 28:52.720]  guy he gets a sub degree of manslaughter in voluntary manslaughter not even
[28:52.720 --> 28:56.480]  manslaughter like you get in a fight with somebody but you start the fight but
[28:56.480 --> 29:00.520]  you punch them in the temple and they bleed out in their brain and die that
[29:00.520 --> 29:03.880]  would be involuntary manslaughter
[29:05.520 --> 29:09.880]  well if you started it it would be manslaughter which means it's an accident
[29:09.880 --> 29:13.800]  still but it's your fault this is involuntary kind of like if you accidentally
[29:13.800 --> 29:16.840]  backed out of your yard but we're doing it too fast you had some
[29:16.840 --> 29:20.280]  culpability that'd be involuntary manslaughter and you run over somebody
[29:20.280 --> 29:24.520]  jurors can render an involuntary manslaughter conviction if they believe
[29:24.520 --> 29:27.880]  the defendant lacked an intent to kill but engaged in conduct so grossly
[29:27.880 --> 29:33.440]  negligent that it amounts to a crime this guy cold-bloodedly without a shadow
[29:33.440 --> 29:38.280]  of a doubt murdered that guy and then the police covered it up and tried to
[29:38.280 --> 29:42.600]  frame the guy they killed now what does that tell you some guy that wanted to go
[29:42.600 --> 29:46.720]  out and see a fireworks display and you murdered him in cold blood and you've
[29:46.720 --> 29:51.920]  gotten away with it you got away with it great job we're on the march the

[33:46.400 --> 33:52.160]  will be live this Sunday I was off for the 4th of July with a great rebroadcast
[33:52.160 --> 34:00.920]  with Jesse Ventura, Ron Paul and of course Judge Andrew Napolitano speaking
[34:00.920 --> 34:05.120]  of Andrew Napolitano he had record ratings again for the Fox business
[34:05.120 --> 34:14.600]  channel over the weekend top show out of the gates just like Ventura's got the
[34:14.600 --> 34:18.880]  top show out of the gates on true TV because people want to hear about the
[34:18.880 --> 34:25.520]  New World Order they want to hear about globalism they are anti-New World Order
[34:29.360 --> 34:34.680]  and it illustrates how far we've come how this information is becoming more and
[34:34.680 --> 34:40.080]  more mainstream that a somebody like Napolitano was given a show on Fox and
[34:40.080 --> 34:52.520]  that B it's top rated but you look at the Drudge Report today every week linking
[34:52.520 --> 34:59.240]  to info wars.com and prisonplanet.com articles now and today linking to a
[34:59.240 --> 35:06.200]  YouTube video almost as an afterthought that I shot and then Aaron put
[35:06.200 --> 35:10.120]  together and I'll talk about that coming up in a few minutes dealing with
[35:10.120 --> 35:14.480]  LeBron James but the fact that the Drudge Report links to Herman von Rumpia
[35:14.480 --> 35:18.400]  calling for world government the head of the EU the fact that he does link to the
[35:18.400 --> 35:21.080]  Financial Times of London when they announced how great world government is
[35:21.080 --> 35:26.480]  and now it's taking over the fact that the icon of alternative media kind of
[35:26.480 --> 35:30.800]  the bridge between alternative and mainstream media Drudge in the last
[35:30.800 --> 35:35.600]  year and a half has really been posting the truth and has been exposing the New
[35:35.600 --> 35:40.200]  World Order and I was pointing that out before he started linking to us all the
[35:40.200 --> 35:46.760]  time it just shows his transformation and it's pretty hardcore video he posted
[35:46.760 --> 35:50.240]  that I cut I mean I talk about the New World Order the global government
[35:50.240 --> 35:55.560]  taking over our country the globalist how they're overthrowing the banks the
[35:55.560 --> 35:58.800]  domestic banks how these foreign banks are taking over how they're getting
[35:58.800 --> 36:09.600]  rid of the dollar how it's all engineered this is incredible the Drudge
[36:09.600 --> 36:15.920]  Report receives tens of millions of visitors per day and many of those
[36:15.920 --> 36:20.640]  visitors are media I've been in mainstream television studios radio
[36:20.640 --> 36:25.080]  studios newspapers I've seen countless photos of news reporters in their
[36:25.080 --> 36:28.120]  newsrooms and if you look in the background you'll see computer screens
[36:28.120 --> 36:32.280]  with the Drudge Report on it this is where so much of the mainstream media
[36:32.280 --> 36:37.840]  goes to see what the agenda is in the alternative media see in the past they
[36:37.840 --> 36:45.400]  said that the establishment set its agenda through the New York Times and
[36:45.400 --> 36:51.400]  to a lesser extent the Washington Post and that the right wing of America its
[36:51.400 --> 36:55.920]  agenda was stated via the Washington Times well people are leaving the
[36:55.920 --> 37:00.280]  Washington Post New York Times and Washington Times in droves from the
[37:00.280 --> 37:04.120]  control left-right paradigm and they're going to info wars.com and
[37:04.120 --> 37:10.200]  prisonplanet.com and they're going to the Drudge Report and it shows that the
[37:10.200 --> 37:13.760]  mainstream media no longer is able to set the agenda and the alternative media
[37:13.760 --> 37:17.240]  setting the agenda and so in the past the mainstream media could ignore a
[37:17.240 --> 37:22.480]  story but because info wars.com and prisonplanet.com leading the way and
[37:22.480 --> 37:27.920]  the Drudge Report was the first big outfit in the US within one day of us
[37:27.920 --> 37:33.080]  covering it to put the fact of Climate Gate on the radar and the mainstream
[37:33.080 --> 37:37.000]  media for another two plus weeks would not report on any of it there was a
[37:37.000 --> 37:48.560]  total blockade a news blackout but that news blackout imploded it failed their
[37:48.560 --> 37:53.360]  shields failed and now it's a complete route of the mainstream media and the
[37:53.360 --> 37:57.480]  mainstream media now admits this they are in freefall they are burning
[37:57.480 --> 38:02.560]  themselves down that at any time they can start telling the truth and survive
[38:02.560 --> 38:12.040]  and remain in place and be part of the game but no they don't want to stay
[38:12.040 --> 38:16.600]  relevant because they can't because they're minor
[38:17.320 --> 38:22.800]  subsidiaries of the military industrial complex and private banking complex
[38:22.800 --> 38:29.280]  that owns them that owns them like little pieces of change in their pockets
[38:29.280 --> 38:33.520]  the hundred million two hundred and three hundred million dollar budgets of
[38:33.520 --> 38:40.640]  different TV networks are nothing nothing compared to just one cruise
[38:40.640 --> 38:48.080]  missile shipment one cruise missile purchase or or the purchase of three
[38:48.080 --> 38:55.320]  or four stealth bombers nothing compared to what the Afghan war cost today or the
[38:55.320 --> 38:59.840]  Iraq war cost today nothing compared to Halliburton and no big contracts in one
[38:59.840 --> 39:04.440]  case what sixteen million dollars or right at sixteen million for a hundred
[39:04.440 --> 39:12.200]  dollar blue tarp five thousand dollar hammers and toilet seats it's all a big
[39:12.200 --> 39:20.120]  ripoff scam and so they're losing all credibility they had their arrogance
[39:20.120 --> 39:23.920]  their hoods bow whatever you wanted to call it a bravada and now that's all
[39:23.920 --> 39:27.360]  imploded they're going my gosh we're dead nobody believes us anymore and so
[39:27.360 --> 39:31.680]  they're sick and the feds on us to start shutting down the web and now that's out
[39:31.680 --> 39:35.920]  in the open so that's even waking people up faster that the alternative media was
[39:35.920 --> 39:43.760]  right and I say in the video I say it's now time for media and government and
[39:43.760 --> 39:47.320]  the public and everybody to choose a side are you with the New World Order and
[39:47.320 --> 39:51.000]  with all their distractions are you gonna stand up defeat the globalist and the
[39:51.000 --> 39:58.200]  drudge report linked it as one of its top stories a hardcore Alex Jones video
[39:58.200 --> 40:04.200]  on the drudge report what does that tell you it tells you that there are a lot of
[40:04.200 --> 40:08.120]  people in the media who are not New World Order who are not sellouts who
[40:08.120 --> 40:12.080]  understand that America is being destroyed and they need to come out and
[40:12.080 --> 40:16.400]  and tell the truth the whole truth of nothing but the truth people are taking
[40:16.400 --> 40:20.960]  my challenge and they're taking action with it and if we simply stand up and
[40:20.960 --> 40:24.600]  point out the emperor has no clothes this New World Order is going to implode
[40:24.600 --> 40:31.440]  period but it's gonna take courage by sheriffs and police and mayors and
[40:31.440 --> 40:39.280]  business leaders and school teachers and pastors and auto mechanics and bass
[40:39.280 --> 40:45.280]  fishing guides and artists it doesn't matter who you are you've got inherent
[40:45.280 --> 40:50.680]  power and the world government is real it's unelected it's authoritarian it's
[40:50.680 --> 40:57.240]  dehumanizing we've got an absolute imperative responsibility not a right
[40:57.240 --> 41:01.080]  but a duty as the Declaration of Independence States it's a right and a
[41:01.080 --> 41:06.200]  duty to stand up and speak out against this we know what modified tyranny is
[41:06.200 --> 41:12.280]  we know hardcore corruption when we see it it was like a two weeks ago I'll walk
[41:12.280 --> 41:16.640]  out in the backyard there's the biggest skunk I've ever seen lights from the
[41:16.640 --> 41:22.720]  back porch we're going out about 20 yards to the edge of the fence and it was
[41:22.720 --> 41:29.480]  the biggest skunk I'd ever seen it it it it probably weighed 40 pounds you
[41:29.480 --> 41:34.600]  could see the stripes on its backs were probably four or five inches apart at the
[41:34.600 --> 41:39.000]  widest point and my French Bulldog ran out and saw it and I said no and he
[41:39.000 --> 41:42.520]  still ran after it and thank God the skunk just got back to the fence and
[41:42.520 --> 41:46.680]  didn't sprain but I knew what a skunk looked like the minute I opened the back
[41:46.680 --> 41:52.280]  door to go out and walk the dog and I see this gigantic skunk alerting with its
[41:52.280 --> 41:57.840]  tail up but luckily its head facing us I was just dumbfounded by the biggest
[41:57.840 --> 42:04.560]  skunk I'd ever seen I knew what it was a big black animal with with two white
[42:04.560 --> 42:08.840]  stripes down its back you know animals in nature let you know what they are it's
[42:08.840 --> 42:12.240]  like a rattlesnake's got a rattle it's not looking for trouble folks like a
[42:12.240 --> 42:15.720]  like a water mox and they're actually aggressive snakes rattlesnakes are not
[42:15.720 --> 42:18.840]  generally aggressive like they want to be left alone that's why the first
[42:18.840 --> 42:22.400]  symbol of this country it was almost the national flag was the rattlesnake
[42:22.400 --> 42:27.320]  that's what Benjamin Franklin wanted and it says don't tread on me look I'm not
[42:27.320 --> 42:32.560]  looking for trouble but I got teeth pal it's the same thing we know what tyranny
[42:32.560 --> 42:38.120]  looks like I mean I walk out my back door there's a gigantic skunk I know what
[42:38.120 --> 42:49.520]  skunk looks like we know what's happening okay here's some of the other news
[42:49.520 --> 42:55.280]  coming up a huge financial information more on the amazing verdict out in
[42:55.280 --> 43:04.280]  California they're now going to move ahead with shops at the malls and at the
[43:04.280 --> 43:11.880]  grocery stores where you've got a face scan thumb print voice print
[43:11.880 --> 43:16.040]  breathalyzer test to be able to get beer or wine and this is going to be for all
[43:16.040 --> 43:19.440]  products soon it's going to be a cashless federal sales tax they're
[43:19.440 --> 43:23.000]  starting that with the tanning salons and other special taxes they're just set
[43:23.000 --> 43:27.000]  the precedent this has all been diagrammed out is public so I've got
[43:27.000 --> 43:31.480]  that news report it's up on prisonplanet.com mark of the beast rears its
[43:31.480 --> 43:36.040]  head in Pennsylvania vintage idea a wine vending machine all you have to do is
[43:36.040 --> 43:39.280]  swipe your driver's license look into the CCTV camera and blow into the
[43:39.280 --> 43:42.800]  breathalyzer and of course this is inside the stores this is inside the
[43:42.800 --> 43:47.520]  grocery stores it's gonna all go cashless I've got that here I've got
[43:47.520 --> 43:52.400]  Belgians plan to wash its dead down the drain bodies must be melted in acid
[43:52.400 --> 43:56.240]  because a body puts off CO2 when it rots so you can't bury your dead now you
[43:56.240 --> 44:00.240]  gotta you've got a dispose of the dead the way the government says it's always
[44:00.240 --> 44:03.280]  been an ancient right that people are allowed to dispose of that they're
[44:03.280 --> 44:07.120]  dead the way their religions these fit but no you will melt the body because
[44:07.120 --> 44:10.520]  it won't put off the deadly carbon dioxide see they they make you do
[44:10.520 --> 44:14.440]  ridiculous things to set the president they control you half of Americans
[44:14.440 --> 44:21.200]  oppose Obama's immigration plan lawsuit says more like 80% in the polls I've
[44:21.200 --> 44:26.160]  seen a bunch of war news they've done a big spy swap so much for those of you
[44:26.160 --> 44:34.040]  out there that said that said that this wasn't Russian spies they just had a
[44:34.040 --> 44:40.360]  spy swap of course they were spies of course they were they had fake names
[44:40.360 --> 44:46.480]  they were here illegally they were sleeper cells they weren't a special
[44:46.480 --> 44:54.320]  forces sleeper cell that's the ones you gotta worry about a sabotage squad no
[44:54.320 --> 45:01.360]  their MO fits a sex sex op and business infiltration op it infiltration op
[45:01.360 --> 45:06.640]  of course they did a swap with us spies that have been held in Russia all these
[45:06.640 --> 45:13.000]  countries have spies but you notice they infiltrated banks and Wall Street and
[45:13.000 --> 45:15.880]  Harvard because that's the shadow government that's who's hijacked our
[45:15.880 --> 45:19.200]  country it's a corporate takeover so the Russians have to infiltrate Wall
[45:19.200 --> 45:27.000]  Street of course they do the Congress is a they're not pedophiles they're on the
[45:27.000 --> 45:30.960]  take most of them and so you know they're they're vestigial they're a
[45:30.960 --> 45:34.840]  ceremonial but not if we can change it not if we have something to do with it
[45:34.840 --> 45:39.080]  we're gonna get this country back at the state level and then federal so that's
[45:39.080 --> 45:43.600]  coming up and when I start the second segment of the eight after I'm gonna get
[45:43.600 --> 45:52.960]  into LeBron James because this story illustrates everything everything and I
[45:52.960 --> 45:57.120]  didn't really in the video the six minute video that's gone mega viral on the
[45:57.120 --> 46:03.480]  web I didn't really even make the main point it was kind of an afterthought I
[46:03.480 --> 46:09.320]  shot as I walked out of here in about six Aaron had it up at about eight well
[46:09.320 --> 46:12.880]  before they made the announcement that he was going to Miami I mean I knew he
[46:12.880 --> 46:18.560]  was going to Miami they got what they don't have a sales tax there I mean they
[46:18.560 --> 46:26.200]  don't have a federal link a state income tax there and it's a lot more money and
[46:26.200 --> 46:30.360]  I knew he was gonna leave I mean he wouldn't show up until the team panicked
[46:30.360 --> 46:33.680]  and said you better get down there there's 4,000 fans at the convention center
[46:33.680 --> 46:38.440]  wanting to worship you and he shut up for 10 minutes and was non-committal I
[46:38.440 --> 46:43.480]  mean you think because you've sung to him and you grovel to him and that's your
[46:43.480 --> 46:51.720]  identity in your state in Ohio your identity is some God that can put a ball
[46:51.720 --> 46:59.200]  in a basket when Ohio is one of the states on the verge of going bankrupt and
[46:59.200 --> 47:09.040]  your governor serenading and you pathetically sit there and begging you
[47:09.040 --> 47:15.920]  beg and beg and beg and beg you just got pimped well I mean what do you expect
[47:15.920 --> 47:21.640]  that's what this country's about why frankly I don't blame the guy it's a
[47:21.640 --> 47:26.760]  vapid shallow thing if your child's playing basketball that's great it's good
[47:26.760 --> 47:29.880]  for them good for their self-confidence good for their heart their lungs but
[47:29.880 --> 47:33.720]  going and worshipping a bunch of arrogant people making ten million dollars a
[47:33.720 --> 47:38.440]  year and having that be your child's role model that's why America's so screwed
[47:38.440 --> 47:40.600]  up
[47:47.840 --> 47:52.360]  people care about Lindsay Lohan they know all about Lindsay Lohan some crackhead
[47:52.360 --> 48:07.080]  blonde hag some burnout skank a joke a mental patient and that's what our young
[48:07.080 --> 48:10.360]  people are taught to care about it's all scientific I've got all the government
[48:10.360 --> 48:17.880]  documents from the 30s 40s 50s all the top psych warfare experts Edward Bernays
[48:17.880 --> 48:22.160]  and others all bragging how they ruined you I've got stuff from the 20s about how
[48:22.160 --> 48:25.000]  they were gonna you can go read it for yourself wrote the book propaganda how
[48:25.000 --> 48:29.200]  they were gonna not have inventors and scientists and trailblazers and Davy
[48:29.200 --> 48:33.960]  Crockett his heroes they don't want that no they were gonna have basketball and
[48:33.960 --> 48:39.360]  football at the time they talked about baseball being a mindless diversion and
[48:39.360 --> 48:46.000]  they got you you know all about in our our our kids sing ballads you know the
[48:46.000 --> 48:49.920]  ballad of Nolan Ryan and by the way Nolan Ryan is a fan of the show I've
[48:49.920 --> 48:53.280]  talked to him and his son he's a good guy and he knows baseball isn't what's
[48:53.280 --> 48:56.000]  important at the end of the day he understands it's fighting the New World
[48:56.000 --> 48:59.760]  Order if we ought to get Nolan Ryan on they offered to come on one time when I
[48:59.760 --> 49:03.760]  ran into him but I just never followed it up that shows them I don't really work
[49:03.760 --> 49:07.800]  on those things that's a good fact jaren Nolan Ryan and I know his son will come
[49:07.800 --> 49:20.560]  on his son's a big fan yeah I called in one time when the Nolan Ryan's son was
[49:20.560 --> 49:24.240]  on the radio he saw me my dad a big fan said that on cave at then I ran into him
[49:24.240 --> 49:30.080]  once on the street they said yeah well come on sometime but I never even
[49:30.080 --> 49:38.160]  followed it up that's because I'm so focused on the news but it would be
[49:38.160 --> 49:40.440]  interesting to have Nolan Ryan on here talk about the New World Order the point
[49:40.440 --> 49:45.240]  is is that that isn't what matters people say well why have Nolan Ryan on

[55:00.720 --> 55:06.320]  wow there has been a law for more than 30 years in israel that it's illegal to
[55:06.320 --> 55:09.440]  talk about the fact that israel has hundreds and hundreds of high-tech
[55:09.440 --> 55:12.640]  nukes and have had them since the early 60s given to them by the
[55:12.640 --> 55:17.200]  us it has been illegal
[55:18.320 --> 55:21.520]  imagine it's like the d notices they have in england
[55:21.520 --> 55:28.560]  uh where they can arrest you arrest you if you report on something the
[55:28.560 --> 55:30.400]  government has ordered you not to report on

[55:59.440 --> 56:01.760]  they were still denying they had them now they don't
[56:01.760 --> 56:05.440]  haratz and so they can have 400 nukes and be
[56:05.440 --> 56:10.000]  threatening to use them on iran but iran can't have peaceful nuclear
[56:10.000 --> 56:15.520]  reactors i mean it's just wrong folks we don't want world war three
[56:15.520 --> 56:18.960]  and if we keep saying it's wrong and then keep saying no

[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:32.560]  bombers near u.s and canadian airspace because the russian military
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:36.240]  is seeking to maintain the quote illusion of power the commander of the
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:39.920]  u.s northern command says
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:47.920]  admiral james winfield jr who took over north com
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:52.160]  those are the boys that helped cover up the 9-11 attack said
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:56.160]  in some cases it's about the illusion of power where power is not quite there
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:03:00.160]  uh boy that sounds like famous last words with the uh titanic
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:06.480]  the captain saying not even god can sink this ship made in voyage
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:09.120]  to the bottom
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:16.560]  to the bottom yeah okay russia
[01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:20.640]  in all it was 20 30 years ago uh but it's got uh
[01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:24.480]  at least 40 000 nuclear weapons and supersonic topolin missiles and nuclear
[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:29.200]  submarines with the equivalent of u.s
[01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:38.000]  Polaris weapons and cruise missiles not just uh missiles but cruise missiles
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:43.680]  not just up down missiles but uh terrain mapping cruise missiles
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:47.920]  and they're all over our coast and shiny subs are popping up behind our
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:51.680]  aircraft carriers undetected probably because the people on board are
[01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:55.520]  watching lebron james on espn and they've got russian
[01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:59.520]  bare bombers and others flying all over the edge of our airspace with
[01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:03.040]  nuclear weapons on board and you've got a north com
[01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:05.760]  commander
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:11.920]  that took over norad that stood down on 9 11 can't deal with supposedly 19
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:17.440]  hijackers from saudi arabia of course that's all a lie north com ran the attack
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:21.520]  and yes north com existed before they officially set it up in 2002 go research
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:26.560]  that for you send me an email and uh now he's
[01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:29.200]  saying that this is the illusion of power well you know what the new world
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:32.320]  order is all about the illusion of power and yeah russia is all about the

[01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:12.080]  a republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights not
[01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:15.440]  democracy not mob rule two wolves and a sheep voting on
[01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:17.760]  what's for dinner so they think they own our land

[01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:04.160]  you should consider buying a solar power generator
[01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:08.080]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:10.560]  bill number two our new energies are
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:14.160]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:18.400]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:21.600]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:24.240]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:28.160]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:31.680]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:34.800]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:37.920]  onages number five a solar power generator provides
[01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:41.360]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the
[01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:44.400]  solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my

[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:26.080]  joining us here now an hour and eight minutes
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:30.640]  in it to the second hour of this friday addition
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:35.440]  and of course we're going to have ted newton coming up joining us here in
[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:39.920]  about 25 minutes from now to talk about a host of issues
[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:42.800]  ted newton to a frequent guest over the years always
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:47.360]  informative and interesting so that is coming up
[01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:52.400]  i shot a video last night as i left the office at about 6 30
[01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:58.720]  because i was in the coffee room and we had television news on and they were
[01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:02.240]  talking about lebron james lebron james the decision
[01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:05.920]  is going to be at nine o'clock eastern tune into espn we're all going to find
[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:09.360]  out the decision and i remember three weeks ago
[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:16.400]  up in his home city where the cavaliers were based that up to four
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:21.760]  thousand people showed up at an event and they were at this event
[01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:25.760]  and they were it was a lebron james appreciation
[01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:30.160]  uh meeting at the local convention center and they were literally singing
[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:34.080]  songs to him worshiping him and he wasn't even going to show up so the
[01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:36.720]  team called him and said you better get here so he showed up even though he knew
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:39.760]  it was coming up in the last 10 minutes was non-committal
[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:43.680]  he can go to florida one of the few states that doesn't have a state income
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:47.520]  tax with a close to a hundred million dollar contract what are you expecting
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:52.240]  to do i put a video out saying look he is going to go to the heat
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:55.280]  and this is all a distraction all a diversion
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:58.880]  from real issues and the drudge report and others linked to it
[01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:03.680]  and that video is now extremely viral but in the video i didn't make really the
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:09.360]  central point how pathetic is this that you can't get
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:15.120]  these people to become angry you can't get these four thousand people
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:20.160]  in the city where his team was based in ohio
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:24.800]  to go and protest the fact that ohio is one of the 46 states listed
[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:28.240]  by the feds and bloomberg is on the verge of total bankruptcy
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:32.240]  and collapse i mean i've seen articles in ohio who are more than half of the
[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:35.360]  sheriff's deputies and major departments are being laid off
[01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:38.640]  and where sheriffs are saying buy guns we can't protect you i mean it's
[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:43.680]  collapsing like mexico or something uh you can't get four thousand people out
[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:46.640]  to protest a government takeover of health care
[01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:51.200]  or anti gun laws in that state and it's the same thing all over the country
[01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:56.080]  but the media feeds into this the mainstream media and promotes
[01:10:56.080 --> 01:11:00.320]  some overpaid person that at the end of the day
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:07.760]  just does not matter like lebron james our country is going into a depression
[01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:11.600]  our country is on the verge of world war three
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:15.520]  that could quite possibly be triggered with an attack
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:20.080]  on iran they're openly announcing the end of the dollar they're openly
[01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:23.520]  announcing that they want to devalue
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:28.160]  our currency and go to this global currency the sdr backed up by a basket
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:35.120]  of currencies and we will pay taxes on uh
[01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:39.360]  all of the activities that we're involved in to this global
[01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:43.840]  offshore system carbon taxes paid to the very same private banks
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:47.280]  that have bankrupted our economy by creating 600 trillion
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:51.040]  in the words the washington post of counterfeit derivative
[01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:54.640]  made-up financial instruments that they used to buy off media
[01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:59.200]  sports teams government factories globalism naftan gatt
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:04.240]  is treason it is the overthrow of our country and i saw some of the comments
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:07.520]  most of the comments i'd say running you know nine out of ten were supporting
[01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:10.880]  me pointing out this is bread in the circus the fall of roam
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:15.920]  a political distraction but somewhere like i just love lebron he makes me feel
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:19.600]  good about myself and proud of my city proud of my state
[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:22.720]  how dare you look all i'm saying is you got your
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:26.400]  priority screwed up and there's a reason this country's going bankrupt
[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:30.240]  there's a reason crooked politicians are running wild because people don't know
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:33.440]  who their state rep is they don't know who their federal rep is
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:37.200]  they don't know who their senator is they don't know who their mayor is i mean
[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:41.120]  take austin texas it is a federal violation of law
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:44.640]  and state law to put a toll road on an existing road the second most busy
[01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:49.920]  road in texas is mopec and it drive and and they'll
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:52.240]  never expand the lanes even though they have a room they'll never put a double
[01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:56.560]  decker in the last 30 years they proposed five years ago three years ago
[01:12:56.560 --> 01:13:00.160]  and two years ago as part of the nafta super highway to put a toll road on it
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:04.720]  and shut two of the three lanes and make them toll road where you've got to pay
[01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:08.000]  how are people going to get off but that's not the issue
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.920]  the issue here is
[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:15.760]  that when we created opposition to the toll road they backed off and said we're
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:18.400]  not going to do it now then they came back a few years later it said we're
[01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:21.280]  going to do it we said no and they said we never said we were going to do it
[01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:24.720]  now they've announced they're going to do it whether we like it or not
[01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:27.920]  and it's about money it's not about fixing traffic it's going to make it
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:32.080]  worse we know in every study it does now
[01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:36.560]  could we get the hundred thousand ut fans that go worship the ut football team
[01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:40.480]  100 000 people to city hall of the million people that live metro
[01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:45.600]  to stop this taking over of 183 mopec and every other major road they're
[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:51.120]  going to put toll roads on five dollars each way on each road
[01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:54.880]  screwing up the traffic when we paid for these roads with tax money
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:58.080]  and the money's going to offshore private toll road corporations
[01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:01.920]  that are taking over our nation that's globalism that's high treason
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:05.280]  this is tyranny let's go ahead and go to this video
[01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:08.960]  that we shot that's gone viral where i break down the facts and the
[01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:12.480]  headline is as the united states collapses media worships
[01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:16.640]  lebron james decide what you want a future or to worship
[01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:20.560]  stupid fake icons here it is
[01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:28.480]  societies don't change whether it was the roman empire
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:32.160]  or nazi germany the population is obsessed
[01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:37.600]  with sports and petty celebrities and the united states is no different
[01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:42.240]  msnbc the new york times are all reporting that we are going into a
[01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:44.960]  depression one of the greatest depressions in
[01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:49.120]  world history and our decadent slob like public and that's
[01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:52.000]  not everyone but large percentages of the public
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:55.600]  could care less they're not involved in their communities
[01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:59.280]  we've got 46 states on the verge of bankruptcy
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:02.800]  the government's raising taxes on every level the border
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:06.080]  with mexico is collapsing mexico has collapsed
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:09.600]  and the public doesn't care because the media has set the agenda
[01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:13.680]  and they tell you to care about lebron james and his decision
[01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:17.040]  and he's playing into it and he's going to announce his stupid decision
[01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:22.320]  it doesn't matter what basketball team he goes to this is a distraction by
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:26.560]  design we have the governor of the state he's currently living in
[01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:29.840]  in a bizarre we are lebron we are the world
[01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:33.440]  literal worship fest with hundreds of celebrities
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:36.560]  this is sickening
[01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:49.200]  imagine the ohio coming to begging and pleading on television and
[01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:52.800]  serenading lebron james with hundreds of other celebrities
[01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:56.880]  when ohio was one of the states slated to go completely bankrupt
[01:15:56.880 --> 01:16:00.320]  we're going into a depression they're about to launch world war three
[01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:05.280]  with iran openly fox news is reporting as if it's a good thing
[01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:09.840]  in new york state in illinois that troops have helped arrest thousands of
[01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:13.120]  citizens and are doing gun sweeps in people's homes
[01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:17.440]  and searching people's cars we're going in to marshal law
[01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:21.440]  offshore banks have overthrown the u.s they've stolen tens of trillions of
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:24.320]  dollars like we're some third world country they're looting
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:27.200]  everything's going to hell in a handbasket so if you want to know why
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:30.000]  your children have no future if you want to know why you're bankrupt if you want
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:33.760]  to know why you're in debt if you want to know why you have no future and have
[01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:38.400]  lost your job or getting your pay cut it's because your priorities are
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:41.440]  wrong it's because you let that idiot box the
[01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:45.120]  television program you since the days that your mother and father
[01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:49.120]  set you in front of the tv for 12 hours a day and your crap filled diapers
[01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:53.920]  it's not too late to admit we're a sick decadent degenerate society
[01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:59.520]  crumbling we are rome it's 410 we're about to collapse ladies and gentlemen
[01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:02.960]  i know you won't know you know about lebron james you don't know 410 is when
[01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:06.800]  rome completely fell to alaric the visigoth leader you better learn history
[01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:11.440]  this is dangerous don't say you weren't warned the globalist engineers
[01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:15.680]  the globalist social engineers look at you and how pathetic you are
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:19.840]  and how the whole world is waiting to see where lebron james goes
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:23.840]  the social controllers look at you and see how you're obsessed with lebron
[01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:26.000]  james and they decide we got a bunch of schmucks
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:30.160]  we've got a bunch of idiots we got a bunch of morons right where we want them
[01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:33.680]  let's destroy their society let's loot it let's pass carbon taxes
[01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:37.120]  let's expand nafta and gat let's announce an end to the dollar as the
[01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:40.400]  global reserve currency you know what that means we've already lost almost all
[01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:43.280]  our industry we're already in a depression when they get rid of the
[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:47.360]  dollar as the world reserve currency your life as you know it is officially
[01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:49.680]  over you're going to be a third world slave like
[01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:52.480]  they are in mexico or nigeria and you know what
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:56.080]  those people down there at least know why they're slaves you are so stupid
[01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:59.280]  and so focused on crap you'll probably still be talking about lindsay
[01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:02.480]  lohan when you're living as a homeless person on the street
[01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:06.320]  my friends we've got to set our priorities and set them now liberty
[01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:09.200]  or tyranny you've got to wake up and decide what is
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:13.360]  important to you saving our republic stopping the globalist takeover or
[01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:17.600]  knowing all the mindless trivia about lebron james and lindsay lohan
[01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:21.600]  there isn't much more time i'm begging you to ask
[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:25.920]  yourselves to look in the mirror and really realize how sick this is
[01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:29.440]  it's not bad like a basketball game but it is mentally ill and sick
[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:33.440]  to buy into this manufactured hype and to have government officials that
[01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:36.720]  should be working for the people we're going to come back and finish the last
[01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:41.200]  minute or two of this in the next segment but why does the bible talk
[01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:44.720]  about have no gods before me well you got the god who's
[01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:50.160]  telling you don't kill don't steal you know love your neighbor
[01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:53.760]  or you can have the god of lebron james or the god of atall fitler
[01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:58.720]  or the god of newt genrich or the god of the environment
[01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:04.400]  humans idolize something and what you idolize is then how you build your life
[01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:08.160]  you build your life around what you think is important
[01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:11.760]  what you invest your time and energy in you're on a beautiful planet in the
[01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:16.160]  middle of the universe spinning around a sun
[01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:19.520]  and there's rainbows and the van allen radiation belt
[01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:24.000]  and the borah borealis the aurora borealis and
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.320]  life and and and birds and bees and just all this incredible
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:35.440]  majesty of creation around us the oceans the miracle of
[01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:39.520]  procreation uh the beauty of art and literature
[01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:44.080]  and everything is debased down to people putting a basket
[01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:47.440]  and putting a ball in a basket or or worshiping
[01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:51.360]  lindsay lohan this is why we're in so much trouble
[01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:55.680]  because our art and our literature and our culture has been dumbed down
[01:19:55.680 --> 01:20:01.360]  to this level well be right back stay with us

[01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:16.320]  and to have government officials that should be working for the people
[01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:20.720]  sitting there in these disgusting media spectacles worshiping somebody
[01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:26.160]  our role models our icons the people that our children look up to
[01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:30.160]  and model themselves after are not inventors and scientists and trail
[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:32.880]  blazers anymore that's why america's gone from the greatest
[01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:36.560]  to the most pathetic in every statistical analysis you look at
[01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:39.520]  and it's only getting worse we still got a lot of great people in this country
[01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:43.760]  but with Pete Rose and LeBron James and Michael Vick
[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:48.000]  being our heroes we're a joke we're clowns
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:51.440]  they've taken our heroes and our role models away ladies and gentlemen
[01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:54.800]  you have been warned and this whole LeBron James decision
[01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:59.440]  means absolutely nothing this obsession with petty issues of little or no
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:03.920]  significance is the modern version of bread and circus it is the opiate of
[01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:08.480]  the masses and it's why we are dumbed down slaves with no future
[01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:19.360]  if we don't wake up you have been warned
[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:23.680]  we are back live and that is the video that i put together last night with
[01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:29.440]  Aaron Dykes does such incredible work we commend
[01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:33.360]  him for putting that video together last night and it's up on the drudge report
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:37.120]  and info wars dot com the article written by Aaron Dykes that accompanies it
[01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:43.360]  is titled as the united states collapses media worships LeBron James and
[01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:48.960]  it is gives me a lot of facts satisfaction to be able to get the
[01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:52.000]  word out about how this bread and circus
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:56.000]  distraction is basically cancer to this nation
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:59.840]  i mean not only do we have the looming war with iran the dollar being
[01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:03.680]  devalued and the un calling for it to lose its world reserve
[01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:08.240]  currency status not only do we have new banker bailouts
[01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:14.400]  on the horizon and the border collapsing and obama treacherously
[01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:19.920]  suing arizona but we have the bp oil spill
[01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:22.720]  ruining the lives of the people on the gulf coast
[01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:26.560]  annihilating the property values destroying these
[01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:32.400]  fishermen and the hurricanes now forming in the gulf to push the
[01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:36.800]  hundreds of millions of gallons of oil toxic sludge into the coastline open
[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:40.560]  discussions of mass evacuations looming in the washington post
[01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:45.920]  another mainstream publications and you've got the entire country
[01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:49.040]  the entire country's mainstream news media not the entire
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:52.880]  population but large portions of it large dumb down
[01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:57.760]  groups completely obsessed over lebron james a basketball player
[01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:00.400]  and you've got them begging him and pleading him
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:05.040]  not to leave and saying our ego is tied up in you you can't go
[01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:11.360]  you can't leave and then he leaves it's just sickening and then i saw
[01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:17.280]  the owner of the team
[01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:24.560]  criticizing him in the news and talking about how treacherous and
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:28.640]  and horrible and despicable his decision was
[01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:33.280]  it's a money-making operation there's no morals involved in this
[01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:37.600]  i mean the media has implied that entertainment is the highest
[01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:44.880]  form of patriotism that it's the only thing that matters in a society
[01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:49.200]  how do we get our young people to think that george washington is their hero
[01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:52.800]  or martin luther king for that matter who did stand up for civil rights for
[01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:58.160]  people or mahat mad ghandi uh or
[01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:01.120]  our veterans
[01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:06.240]  or every few months i read about a fireman or an emergency rescue worker
[01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:10.400]  who dies going into a house to save children or who gets badly burned or
[01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:15.600]  someone who drowns trying to save people uh from a overflowing river i mean
[01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:19.520]  those are heroes those are people we should model ourselves after
[01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:23.200]  not lebron james i mean the way they built up
[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:26.480]  obama as this messianic leader the way they built up bush
[01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:29.680]  as someone we should admire some political operative
[01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:34.400]  we've got to change who our role models are we've got to start
[01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:38.240]  realizing that that what's important is what people stand up for
[01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:43.680]  heroes are individuals who despite the fact that the media demonizes them
[01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:47.200]  stand up for the second amendment and stand up for the constitution and
[01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:52.320]  stand up for this country's sovereignty uh
[01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:56.640]  that's why i admire celebrities who take stances that are politically
[01:28:56.640 --> 01:28:59.360]  incorrect uh knowing they're going to be attacked by
[01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:03.120]  the media knowing they're not going to be promoted by the media
[01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:06.560]  because they understand that their celebrity needs to be used for something
[01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:10.560]  good i mean i don't agree with a lot of things that shan penn has done
[01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:13.920]  but i did have a chance to meet him in denver a few years ago and i and i
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:17.120]  admire him for trying to go and help people in haiti
[01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:21.200]  you know that's why i admire the things that ted nugent does because he stands
[01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:25.200]  up for property rights and the second amendment i mean that's the type of
[01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:29.520]  information uh that needs to be gotten out to the public
[01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:34.160]  this is the type of information that people need to be made aware of

[01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:04.400]  the book that of course well is a number one new york times bestseller
[01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:07.840]  now coming out in paperback well i wrote ted white and blue the new
[01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:11.840]  jim manifesto a few years ago is an ongoing
[01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:16.160]  attempt and a successful one on my part to raise hell
[01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:20.400]  to actually have the audacity to participate in this sacred experiment
[01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:24.320]  self-government i believe alex that what is in the pages of ted white and blue
[01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:27.280]  the new jim manifesto and certainly what you do on the radio every day and
[01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:30.240]  what more and more people are waking up to the reality of
[01:35:30.240 --> 01:35:36.800]  is that in order to earn your americanism you have to actually participate
[01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:43.280]  and be engaged in this very responsible and very critical duty
[01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:49.200]  of a self-experiment self-government uh i realized way back in the 60s when i
[01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:53.120]  was attacked on hippie rock and roll radio for not doing their drugs and not
[01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:55.920]  drooling and puking like all the other zombie
[01:35:55.920 --> 01:36:00.640]  dips out there and they would attack me for carrying a gun and believing in self-defense
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:03.760]  and hunting and fishing and trapping and all these
[01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:08.320]  perfect environmental positives that the new jim family celebrates
[01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:14.320]  that i realized that the left are brain dead
[01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:18.480]  they're dangerous they're they literally celebrate the bad and the evil
[01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:23.360]  well i try to maximize the good so i started maximizing the good in an attempt
[01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:27.120]  to destroy the bad and the ugly and and it's been
[01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:31.280]  very successful because i gotta tell you alex i'm a gregarious guy i traveled
[01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:33.840]  this country we have an incredible tour right now
[01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:37.440]  50 years later it's called trample the weak herbal the dead
[01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:41.280]  i got the greatest band in the world we're selling out every night all these
[01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:45.200]  years later and the the positive energy
[01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:50.080]  the goodwill the decency the logic that alex jones represents
[01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:53.440]  the logic that is in ted wight and blue the new jim manifesto and
[01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:58.240]  in my weekly articles on human events dot com and washington times dot com
[01:36:58.240 --> 01:37:01.840]  that i'm not the weirdo the left are the weirdo
[01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:06.400]  history has proven that everything barack obama stands for and is
[01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:12.880]  implementing has destroyed societies 100 percent of the time
[01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:16.240]  but if you continue to placate and try to
[01:37:16.240 --> 01:37:21.120]  a cuddle with the pimps and the whores and the welfare brats
[01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:24.960]  that people will be inclined to vote for politicians
[01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:29.600]  who will give stuff to the pimps and the whores and the welfare brats so
[01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:33.280]  ted wight and blue the new jim manifesto is a battle cry
[01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:39.120]  to bring the good forward and to and to celebrate the most productive american
[01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:43.600]  families there are while we crush the bad and the ugly of barack hussain obama
[01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:48.400]  and his legions of pimps whores and welfare brats well expanding on that
[01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:52.400]  liberty and freedom and and and and building our republic and saving it
[01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:56.720]  from the jaws of collectivism and globalism this is not a spectator sport
[01:37:56.720 --> 01:38:00.320]  and that's what's so good about you ted is i know you've been persecuted
[01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:05.200]  but it didn't you know make you cry and go into the shadows it didn't make you
[01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:09.520]  sell out to these people you stood up to them and became even more successful
[01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:13.040]  despite the fact in the last three decades that you didn't submit
[01:38:13.040 --> 01:38:16.560]  to their propaganda and brainwashing and as you said
[01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:20.320]  you have now succeeded doing it your way as a true american
[01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:25.520]  whereas they have failed you are popular your message is stronger now
[01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:29.280]  not weaker their message is weakening by the day they are
[01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:32.800]  bleeding out uh like uh you know some uh
[01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:37.040]  some wildcat that ted new jim's just blasted well you know
[01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:41.760]  for years i i've been attacked as being an extremist and a radical and out of
[01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:44.320]  control and to all those accusations i would like
[01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:46.800]  to plead live on the alex jones radio show
[01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:50.720]  you're damn right you're damn right i'm an extremist
[01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:54.160]  i'm extremely free i'm not kind of free
[01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:57.680]  i don't have i don't kind of have individual rights room
[01:38:57.680 --> 01:39:04.000]  bader ginsberg john paul stevens sanya thottemire you racist punk
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:10.320]  steven brier these subhuman anti-american punks
[01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:13.520]  in black robes in the supreme court of the united states
[01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:17.600]  who actually wrote alex help me through this if i have an aneurysm on your
[01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:20.880]  radio show send someone to resuscitate me
[01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:26.560]  because we have four americans and i'm being generous with the term
[01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:29.680]  who have actually written a supreme court
[01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:36.480]  statement that american citizens have no fundamental right to self defense they
[01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:39.520]  didn't even say second amendmenters keeping bare arms
[01:39:39.520 --> 01:39:46.800]  these four subhuman supreme court punks don't believe that american
[01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:52.320]  citizens have a basic right to self defense i'm a creative guy alex i'm
[01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:55.360]  an imaginative guy i not only wrote wang dang sweet
[01:39:55.360 --> 01:39:58.640]  pun dang i mean it every night when i sing it
[01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:04.480]  but my creative juices pale and come to a screeching halt
[01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:11.600]  trying to come up with something more offensive more anti-human than four
[01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:17.200]  punk anti-justices on the supreme court who don't think american citizens have
[01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:22.320]  the right to self-defense i recommend they dial 1-800-EAT-ME
[01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:25.520]  ted newton i mean this really is an act of treason
[01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:30.160]  of sedition it's so dangerous i mean obama is now gonna probably get a
[01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:32.800]  couple more justices in and instead of them
[01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:36.080]  ruling that we have a limited second amendment which is bad enough
[01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:39.840]  they're going to rule we have no right and we know attorney general holder
[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:44.080]  in cases has argued that he believes in the un's policy
[01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:48.320]  that bill clinton signed on to with the unidire documents in the un treaty
[01:40:48.320 --> 01:40:51.520]  that no citizen is allowed to have any firearm
[01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:56.800]  and that only the state can own guns as a quote power monopoly that's a quote the
[01:40:56.800 --> 01:41:00.080]  power monopoly of the state these people really are joe
[01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:04.640]  stalin adolf hitler malsey tongue rolled into one they
[01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:07.520]  know that political power goes out of the barrel of the gun
[01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:11.840]  they know that we will be we the people as long as we're armed as that ultimate
[01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:15.360]  check against tyranny and that's why they hunger and lust
[01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:18.320]  after our precious guns and i will remind them
[01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:24.160]  that in 1775 in lexington and concord the the the war was kicked off that led
[01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:28.480]  to 1776 and the declaration of independence in july 4th and mom and
[01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:31.600]  apple pie and everything good about this country
[01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:35.200]  when the british came to take the guns and the ammo
[01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:39.520]  and i remind them again that the day they try to actually say we can't own
[01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:42.240]  our guns is the day they're in a lot of trouble
[01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:46.640]  they are a bunch of want to be joe stalin's they are criminals
[01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:49.600]  i couldn't have said it better myself alex god bless you for that
[01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:54.800]  that kind of inescapable historical evidence that you just articulated
[01:41:54.800 --> 01:42:00.720]  with the proper passion alex feel good today in 2010
[01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:06.880]  that spirit that most critical and important american genetic trait of
[01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:11.760]  defiance is alive and well and growing out of the
[01:42:11.760 --> 01:42:17.840]  cesspool of apathy that allowed american citizens to bend over to the
[01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:22.880]  unforgivable degree to allow the malsey tongue fan club into the white house
[01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:27.680]  and a lot of people out of nowhere alex jones and ted newton it's hyper six of
[01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:33.360]  his ours appraised now it's every word you say every word i wrote in
[01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:38.000]  ted white and blue the newton manifesto my weekly columns at human events dot
[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:41.920]  com and washington times dot com big alex you've got to connect with my
[01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:46.000]  website ted newton dot com i've got thousands of articles i've written
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:49.920]  that no one can argue with in fact here's the beauty of it alex
[01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:54.000]  here's what my critics do when they when they attack me even on those websites
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:57.760]  those conservative websites they they constantly repeat
[01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:02.240]  the solace keep cloward piven modus operandi
[01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:07.120]  everywhere i write an article this is so beautiful i can hardly stand myself
[01:43:07.120 --> 01:43:09.840]  i'm more proud of what i'm about to tell you alex then
[01:43:09.840 --> 01:43:15.360]  anything in my life every time i stand up and write an article or speak or do
[01:43:15.360 --> 01:43:18.480]  interviews the left goes berserk and they call
[01:43:18.480 --> 01:43:22.240]  me a draft dodger i did not dodge the draft i had a
[01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:26.160]  one-wide deferment they call me a child molester
[01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:32.560]  and sex offender i've never been charged with or convicted
[01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:37.920]  of any of those evil accusations but based on the solace keep playbook that
[01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:41.120]  hillary clinton did her pieces in college on
[01:43:41.120 --> 01:43:44.800]  they need to attack with the most vicious and hateful lies they can't
[01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:49.520]  oh oh ted ted you should be proud that's a badge of honor
[01:43:49.520 --> 01:43:53.840]  well listen i mean they've had national tv and christ matthews claim that i'm
[01:43:53.840 --> 01:43:56.880]  calling for violence when i've never called for violence i've said we have
[01:43:56.880 --> 01:44:01.040]  a right to defend ourselves against criminals i mean it's insane how much
[01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:04.800]  they lie but but shifting gears into another area that follows that line i
[01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:09.280]  want to read you a quote here uh this is the definition of high treason
[01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:12.240]  participating in a war against one's country
[01:44:12.240 --> 01:44:16.240]  attempting to overthrow its government spying on its military its diplomats
[01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:19.920]  or its secret services for a hostile foreign power
[01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:24.960]  now what is it by definition to have obama
[01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:28.240]  violate the ninth tenth and eleventh amendment the eleventh amendment says the
[01:44:28.240 --> 01:44:31.840]  federal government cannot sue a state or an individual on behalf of a foreign
[01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:36.160]  power or state and cannot sue an individual citizen on
[01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:39.120]  behalf of a foreign power state or individual
[01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:42.400]  so that's the eleventh not just the tenth amendment all the scholars have
[01:44:42.400 --> 01:44:45.200]  looked at it and said that all the arizona law does
[01:44:45.200 --> 01:44:48.880]  is it's a copy of the federal law and it says if we have first contact with a
[01:44:48.880 --> 01:44:52.560]  drunk driving illegal alien or if we come to a crime scene and they're an
[01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:55.360]  illegal alien with no id we're going to take him to jail
[01:44:55.360 --> 01:44:59.680]  so it's okay to throw the book at citizens in colorado two days ago
[01:44:59.680 --> 01:45:03.840]  a 82 year old veteran was being robbed at his house they were stealing his
[01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:07.600]  his his vehicle his trailer they tried to run over him he shot one of the
[01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:11.600]  illegals the illegal pled guilty the police released the wounded illegal
[01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:14.880]  and his cohort and they're charging him with murder
[01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:20.240]  and he's facing life in prison so the border has collapsed
[01:45:20.240 --> 01:45:25.360]  sheriffs are begging for help 80 plus miles into arizona is literally run by
[01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:27.840]  illegals they're signs up saying don't drive down this road
[01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:31.200]  don't go in this national park don't go on the state park arizona is begging
[01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:35.280]  for help and obama sends the feds in to sue them
[01:45:35.280 --> 01:45:38.480]  to block the state trying to restore law and order that is lawful
[01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:42.000]  and it's worse senator kyle meets with obama and obama says
[01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:46.000]  i want that crisis to get worse to force through amnesty if that isn't high
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:50.880]  trees and ted newgent what is it well by all common sense and logic uh the
[01:45:50.880 --> 01:45:56.240]  president united states and and most of his zars um many of his
[01:45:56.240 --> 01:45:59.440]  administration are guilty of all the crimes you just
[01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:02.560]  outline anybody doesn't get that is either brain dead
[01:46:02.560 --> 01:46:06.400]  or i have their heads so far up their asses not to have seen daylight that
[01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:12.560]  last century uh i believe that uh the good governor
[01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:17.440]  uh brewer is doing god's work in arizona i believe that the good
[01:46:17.440 --> 01:46:20.720]  citizens of arizona i was down there when uh
[01:46:20.720 --> 01:46:25.200]  our our good rancher was murdered by illegal invaders
[01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:29.520]  and that our government did nothing did nothing in response to an american
[01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:33.520]  being murdered by by mexican invaders this
[01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:37.920]  this wouldn't even qualify as a bad script for planet of the apes
[01:46:37.920 --> 01:46:43.280]  alex but i have confidence i i i i'm on to i'm on to right now i've already
[01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:46.400]  done like 20 some cities and i got another 40 to go
[01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:50.640]  and i i i communicate with the heroes of law enforcement
[01:46:50.640 --> 01:46:54.800]  our border patrol agents all arms of the u.s military
[01:46:54.800 --> 01:46:58.800]  are at every concert we have a little pow wow we drink a little ginger ale
[01:46:58.800 --> 01:47:02.480]  and eat a little guacamole backstage every night and we talk about the
[01:47:02.480 --> 01:47:06.320]  important issues and i believe that there is a growing
[01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:10.880]  activism there's a growing re-engagement of we the people
[01:47:10.880 --> 01:47:15.520]  we are we are once again identifying the self-evident truth that is articulated
[01:47:15.520 --> 01:47:18.000]  guaranteed in the u.s constitution the bill of rights
[01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:21.360]  certainly that america is based on the ten commandments the golden rule
[01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:26.000]  and and overall excellence being the vehicle by which you achieve the
[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:29.360]  american dream that's now starting to become a fist
[01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:34.080]  pounding our communication a little bit more passion more like like alex
[01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:39.600]  jones would do like that nuja would do i see a growing fervor and a growing
[01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:42.480]  enlightenment and communication amongst
[01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:45.280]  fanleaps at the workplace at church at school
[01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:49.680]  where we're starting to identify that the president hates america
[01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:54.320]  that the president hates the american dream that the america is that the
[01:47:54.320 --> 01:47:58.000]  president of the united states is waging war
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:02.000]  on the american dream entrepreneurialism and excellence
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:07.840]  he literally is implementing policies that are clear and present danger that
[01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:11.520]  are acts of treason and i believe that come november
[01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:15.360]  like we did up in massachusetts and a few other midterm elections recently
[01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:19.120]  the incumbents and the feds illocrats the corruption
[01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:23.280]  the entrenched abuse of power that is rampant in our government today
[01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:27.520]  is going to get a root awakening i believe that we're going to take
[01:48:27.520 --> 01:48:32.880]  this country back in a nonviolent way i believe that the very fact that there
[01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:35.760]  are more guns per capita in the united states more
[01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:39.760]  ars more ammo than any society in recorded
[01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:43.680]  history alex the statistics are irrefutable
[01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:47.520]  that that is an entrenchment statement don't
[01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:51.920]  tread on me you better hope
[01:48:51.920 --> 01:48:56.240]  we take this country back nonviolently because we can and we will
[01:48:56.240 --> 01:49:00.960]  but the alternative will accomplish the same thing
[01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:04.240]  well the system knows that law enforcement sent us the mayak and
[01:49:04.240 --> 01:49:08.000]  homeland security reports we broke that back in january of last year and
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:11.280]  they're not worried about people wearing turbans and caves you know that's
[01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:15.920]  what they sell the public on the entire federal apparatus
[01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:19.600]  under lord obama is for returning veterans gun owners
[01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:23.760]  conservatives people like ron paul people even like the libertarian
[01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:27.280]  presidential candidate that's pretty much milk toast bob bar
[01:49:27.280 --> 01:49:30.400]  they're saying if somebody has an american flag or get us out of the un
[01:49:30.400 --> 01:49:33.360]  sticker on their car that they want to kill cops
[01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:37.360]  i mean this really shows the treason that basically those reports
[01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:41.520]  if you boil them down say that if you've got a portrait of john wane
[01:49:41.520 --> 01:49:44.480]  or ted newton hanging in your house you're a terrorist
[01:49:44.480 --> 01:49:48.240]  yeah it's phenomenal if you listen to uh the president
[01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:53.440]  and his uh attorney general uh his uh the secretary treasurer of the entire
[01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:57.600]  administration if you if you listen to nine out of ten bureaucrats out there
[01:49:57.600 --> 01:50:02.080]  right now uh you literally are hearing uh without
[01:50:02.080 --> 01:50:09.040]  flinching their hatred for america their support for illegal invaders
[01:50:09.040 --> 01:50:14.720]  their uh intentional dismantling of this american dream to see america
[01:50:14.720 --> 01:50:18.880]  experiment self-government so again the tea party is but the tip
[01:50:18.880 --> 01:50:23.200]  of a cultural war spear that is being sharpened as we speak alex
[01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:26.880]  um again i think the prognosis is better than it was a few years ago
[01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:30.800]  the line drawn in the sand has never been more obvious and more defined
[01:50:30.800 --> 01:50:33.600]  i believe that more and more americas are waking up
[01:50:33.600 --> 01:50:37.600]  that we have it we the people are the cause of all this
[01:50:37.600 --> 01:50:42.080]  we let the rats into our house for the last 50 years
[01:50:42.080 --> 01:50:49.280]  but it took a really stinky communist toxic rat
[01:50:49.280 --> 01:50:53.840]  like barack hussain obama and his maltsi tong fan club
[01:50:53.840 --> 01:50:57.680]  to finally wake up americans that this man this
[01:50:57.680 --> 01:51:05.280]  this this community organizer and chief hates america and he would be just
[01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:11.760]  tickled tink if america turned into his indonesian dream but we the people are
[01:51:11.760 --> 01:51:14.960]  waking up the tea party is the tip of the iceberg and i believe that we're
[01:51:14.960 --> 01:51:19.840]  going to vote these bastards out as a b i believe that the next few years
[01:51:19.840 --> 01:51:23.120]  elections are going to be a shocking wake-up call
[01:51:23.120 --> 01:51:28.160]  to these abusive power monsters that come trickle down from the president
[01:51:28.160 --> 01:51:32.800]  united states so we do have to turn up the heat anybody right now alex in
[01:51:32.800 --> 01:51:36.080]  america who's not in constant communication with their elected
[01:51:36.080 --> 01:51:39.360]  officials their senator their congressman their mayor their government
[01:51:39.360 --> 01:51:43.600]  their governor saying stop the tax and burn
[01:51:43.600 --> 01:51:48.480]  stop with this insanity of forbidding uh entrepreneurs from digging for the
[01:51:48.480 --> 01:51:54.720]  energy that we the people need the bp spill is but 0.001 to
[01:51:54.720 --> 01:51:58.880]  eight percent of faults by bp and the drilling industry
[01:51:58.880 --> 01:52:05.760]  whereas the fed zillacrats are guilty 99.8 of the time of abusing their power
[01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:11.440]  bp is the enemy fed zilla is the enemy well i mean expanding on that of all
[01:52:11.440 --> 01:52:14.080]  the oil companies and i'm and i'm you know i'm pro energy
[01:52:14.080 --> 01:52:17.440]  pro cheap energy and i am you know pro drill baby drill
[01:52:17.440 --> 01:52:21.680]  bp are the the one oil company that pushed the carbon tax they're one of
[01:52:21.680 --> 01:52:26.000]  the biggest contributors to obama they met with ken lay of enron and al gore
[01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:30.320]  uh back in 1995 to come up with the carbon trading scheme and i'm very
[01:52:30.320 --> 01:52:33.200]  suspicious uh ted of this whole thing and the way
[01:52:33.200 --> 01:52:35.920]  obama has been blocking the relief effort
[01:52:35.920 --> 01:52:38.960]  and and not letting those skimmerships and other things come in
[01:52:38.960 --> 01:52:42.400]  and blocking the states from building berms i think he wants this to be as
[01:52:42.400 --> 01:52:46.000]  bad as possible and he now admits he wants to get a carbon tax with it
[01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:50.160]  well i think your suspicions are well founded i think that again alex
[01:52:50.160 --> 01:52:57.040]  the job of an american citizen is to remain suspicious to turn up the heat
[01:52:57.040 --> 01:53:00.080]  and the pressure and the probing and the scrutiny
[01:53:00.080 --> 01:53:03.680]  of our elected officials and our government constantly
[01:53:03.680 --> 01:53:08.640]  so i i join you in that suspicion but i was stating a statistic regarding bp's
[01:53:08.640 --> 01:53:11.920]  you know spill rate and their their so-called accident rate i'm still
[01:53:11.920 --> 01:53:15.280]  not sure whether it was an accident or negligence i gotta tell you
[01:53:15.280 --> 01:53:18.720]  you know i've never been attacked in my home but i got a gun in every corner
[01:53:18.720 --> 01:53:22.960]  i've never had a fire in my house but i've got a regardless
[01:53:22.960 --> 01:53:26.160]  the rest of the industry shouldn't be punished for bp's
[01:53:26.160 --> 01:53:30.880]  bad record they do have the worst record exactly that's communism that alex
[01:53:30.880 --> 01:53:34.880]  they won't be punished we will be exactly so i mean
[01:53:34.880 --> 01:53:37.920]  look if my neighbor commits a crime i don't go to jail with him
[01:53:37.920 --> 01:53:42.560]  that's communism yep well welcome to the marxist fan club of barraque

[01:54:02.640 --> 01:54:05.280]  ted newton we're almost out of town we've only got about four minutes left
[01:54:05.280 --> 01:54:07.360]  for you and then you've got to go jump on a plane
[01:54:07.360 --> 01:54:10.880]  but a few other questions that i wanted to raise with ted newton
[01:54:10.880 --> 01:54:13.680]  while he's with us ted newton dot com our side of course
[01:54:13.680 --> 01:54:18.160]  is info wars dot com what is your overall
[01:54:18.160 --> 01:54:22.000]  of you on the government takeover of health care now we're finding out it
[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:25.840]  doesn't cover the uninsured now we find out the insurance companies wrote it
[01:54:25.840 --> 01:54:29.440]  now we find out the big offshore banks were involved now we find out it's just
[01:54:29.440 --> 01:54:34.240]  another banker bailout well again god bless guys like glenn beck i've
[01:54:34.240 --> 01:54:37.760]  never seen anybody spotlight more cockroaches than alex
[01:54:37.760 --> 01:54:41.520]  jones and glenn beck and he's bringing forth these videos
[01:54:41.520 --> 01:54:46.000]  and showing the statements the unflinching statements
[01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:50.080]  by the barraco obama cronies out there who have articulated that
[01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:54.720]  the takeover of the health care industry is merely one of their baby steps
[01:54:54.720 --> 01:54:58.560]  although it could be a giant step much like cap and trade
[01:54:58.560 --> 01:55:02.640]  and the taking over of general motors and the fedzilla
[01:55:02.640 --> 01:55:08.560]  uh... intrusion into a private business across this country that's all part of
[01:55:08.560 --> 01:55:13.120]  his marx's agenda you'll really examine the voting record of
[01:55:13.120 --> 01:55:17.280]  barraco obama who is basically a clueless rookie
[01:55:17.280 --> 01:55:21.200]  whose only credentials is a community organizer organizer
[01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:26.000]  which pretty much any hippie could do uh... the president's agenda
[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:30.720]  is his czar's agenda his administration's agenda
[01:55:30.720 --> 01:55:34.720]  van jones was thrown out but alex we all know
[01:55:34.720 --> 01:55:41.040]  that everybody around the president is a van jones and they're putting on their
[01:55:41.040 --> 01:55:45.200]  shirt and tie and they're backing down their their extremist revolutionary
[01:55:45.200 --> 01:55:48.320]  rhetoric so that they can be more palatable palatable
[01:55:48.320 --> 01:55:52.080]  well it's now come out that john p holdren wrote that he wants just a few
[01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:55.040]  years ago the complete transfer of our wealth
[01:55:55.040 --> 01:55:57.840]  globally i mean these guys are very dangerous but
[01:55:57.840 --> 01:56:01.840]  my last question for ted newton is this ted everybody i talked to gets the same
[01:56:01.840 --> 01:56:05.760]  intel and we see not just democrats being voted out but pro-establishment
[01:56:05.760 --> 01:56:10.720]  republicans in every primary so it's the incumbent establishment people
[01:56:10.720 --> 01:56:13.760]  that are being voted out this is a political realignment
[01:56:13.760 --> 01:56:19.120]  away from tyranny towards the foundation of this country the spirit of 1776
[01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:23.040]  and so i mean in closing it sounds like you're saying but i want your own words
[01:56:23.040 --> 01:56:26.320]  that you're seeing just a turbocharged awakening the
[01:56:26.320 --> 01:56:28.400]  likes of which you've never seen on the road
[01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:32.640]  i'm 62 years old this year alex and i you're you're correct i'm seeing a
[01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:36.000]  turbocharged awakening across this country
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:40.640]  and most relievingly from the heroes of law enforcement and military
[01:56:40.640 --> 01:56:44.160]  where i believe in this is the deciding factor alex and this is a
[01:56:44.160 --> 01:56:48.080]  this is a great point to celebrate that if the
[01:56:48.080 --> 01:56:51.280]  oh there's a military term that i'll give you the first two syllables on your
[01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:54.960]  turn on your show it's a cluster it's a cluster
[01:56:54.960 --> 01:57:00.160]  whack so to speak that when and if these
[01:57:00.160 --> 01:57:03.840]  mount seitung fan clubbers in the white house and the zars and the
[01:57:03.840 --> 01:57:07.840]  administration of barack hosane obama if they dare
[01:57:07.840 --> 01:57:12.640]  continue down the road they're going and if all hell breaks loose
[01:57:12.640 --> 01:57:16.640]  i am convinced that the majority of law enforcement
[01:57:16.640 --> 01:57:21.120]  and the majority of military personnel will be on the side
[01:57:21.120 --> 01:57:24.880]  of we the people if that doesn't tell you something that they
[01:57:24.880 --> 01:57:29.840]  voluntarily uh offer that testimony everywhere i go
[01:57:29.840 --> 01:57:33.680]  that's an indicator that bring me great hope because i believe that we're
[01:57:33.680 --> 01:57:37.360]  going to take back this country in a nonviolent voting way
[01:57:37.360 --> 01:57:40.800]  it's going to be a huge takeover you're right the incumbents
[01:57:40.800 --> 01:57:45.280]  they're all guilty to some degree uh we need to watch and make sure that we
[01:57:45.280 --> 01:57:48.080]  keep the the uh the good guys in there we got some good
[01:57:48.080 --> 01:57:51.760]  guys like uh mike cox and mike rogers in michigan
[01:57:51.760 --> 01:57:55.520]  we got good guys here in texas like governor rick perry and some of the
[01:57:55.520 --> 01:57:58.240]  republicans there's actually a few democrats out there
[01:57:58.240 --> 01:58:01.520]  that still pretend they're not the same camp is nancy polosi
[01:58:01.520 --> 01:58:06.000]  uh we wish them well but we the people are in charge and if we continue with
[01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:11.360]  the apathy america's going to hell if we re-engage and function as we the people
[01:58:11.360 --> 01:58:15.200]  suspicious of our government and constantly spotlighting the cox rogers
[01:58:15.200 --> 01:58:19.520]  and fed silicrats and abusers of power then we will get this great experiment
[01:58:19.520 --> 01:58:23.520]  self-government back soon i believe the prognosis is gaining
[01:58:23.520 --> 01:58:26.720]  positive momentum alex but we need to turn up the heat
[01:58:26.720 --> 01:58:30.960]  and re-engage on every level in our neighborhoods in our churches in our
[01:58:30.960 --> 01:58:33.760]  schools in our communities and take this country back

[02:00:59.600 --> 02:01:03.520]  arizona sheriff popping in who's got mexican mafia
[02:01:03.520 --> 02:01:07.040]  uh hits out on him the mechanics have been turned loose and
[02:01:07.040 --> 02:01:10.640]  folks it's not a joke when ms 13 the mexican mafia have killed
[02:01:10.640 --> 02:01:16.000]  over 2 000 police just the last year it's 24 000 dead now in the last two years
[02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:20.480]  in mexico thousands dead on the u.s side the media was actually the
[02:01:20.480 --> 02:01:25.280]  liberal fake media the establishment media uh was claiming that this is that
[02:01:25.280 --> 02:01:28.480]  that's just when they issue a hit it's just a joke
[02:01:28.480 --> 02:01:31.360]  and i wonder how they're going to spend dead sheriffs
[02:01:31.360 --> 02:01:34.640]  they'll probably say they're al-qaeda or something knowing the media well the
[02:01:34.640 --> 02:01:38.480]  sheriff he was evil you know the mexican mafia is good
[02:01:38.480 --> 02:01:42.880]  killing everybody in mexico so that's all coming up

[02:02:14.640 --> 02:02:18.640]  bob so much happens as we talked to you seven days ago last friday
[02:02:18.640 --> 02:02:21.680]  uh we've now passed another birthday for our country
[02:02:21.680 --> 02:02:25.120]  and i think that overall we're in a lot of trouble but people are starting to
[02:02:25.120 --> 02:02:27.600]  accelerate their awakening we heard the same thing from
[02:02:27.600 --> 02:02:31.680]  ted nugent but on the economy what do you think are the biggest and most
[02:02:31.680 --> 02:02:35.280]  important developments we've seen the last seven days
[02:02:35.280 --> 02:02:39.440]  well there's a number of them um i think we looked to europe first
[02:02:39.440 --> 02:02:45.920]  and uh a loan was made um about a year ago from the european central bank
[02:02:45.920 --> 02:02:53.440]  uh two other banks and um it was for about 557 billion dollars
[02:02:53.440 --> 02:03:00.480]  and instead of reissuing it for a year uh what they are doing is reissuing that
[02:03:00.480 --> 02:03:04.160]  loan for quarters every three months and
[02:03:04.160 --> 02:03:07.680]  also there's supplements to that if they need it
[02:03:07.680 --> 02:03:11.040]  and the total amount is around six hundred and twenty
[02:03:11.040 --> 02:03:16.000]  six hundred and sixty four billion on the new loan line will call it
[02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:20.720]  and you can go back two and a half to three years here
[02:03:20.720 --> 02:03:27.040]  and the scandal of the miss rating and the criminal activity of wall street
[02:03:27.040 --> 02:03:31.600]  and banking in selling collateralized devil debt
[02:03:31.600 --> 02:03:35.600]  obligations which are bonds which contain mortgages 60 percent of which
[02:03:35.600 --> 02:03:39.120]  were dumped in europe and they are nowhere near
[02:03:39.120 --> 02:03:43.200]  recovering from that just like uh the american institutions have purchased
[02:03:43.200 --> 02:03:48.880]  them as well and so europe is in very tough shape
[02:03:48.880 --> 02:03:52.320]  and it's not only the pigs that you hear about which are the
[02:03:52.320 --> 02:03:57.280]  five nations that have fiscal and monetary problems
[02:03:57.280 --> 02:04:01.440]  it's also the people the countries the banks
[02:04:01.440 --> 02:04:04.800]  to bought the bonds which they said that they should have never bought in the
[02:04:04.800 --> 02:04:07.600]  first place and of course countries like
[02:04:07.600 --> 02:04:10.960]  Greece and Italy should have never been accepted
[02:04:10.960 --> 02:04:14.800]  into the euro but don't worry the very same mega banks that sold in the time
[02:04:14.800 --> 02:04:18.080]  bomb derivatives uh they've got a new solution
[02:04:18.080 --> 02:04:22.400]  a global government we pay our carbon taxes to bob
[02:04:22.400 --> 02:04:26.000]  that's right and i think uh the evolution
[02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:29.040]  uh that you just talked about in the introduction
[02:04:29.040 --> 02:04:34.960]  about uh the special drawing rights and the dumping of the dollar
[02:04:34.960 --> 02:04:38.480]  they think it's time to do that and we come back we'll get into it i remember
[02:04:38.480 --> 02:04:41.920]  you five years ago talking about s dr's will be the global cashless
[02:04:41.920 --> 02:04:44.560]  currency people said well wait a minute that's a basket of currencies
[02:04:44.560 --> 02:04:47.760]  but this central group of bankers will set those values
[02:04:47.760 --> 02:04:51.680]  it'll give them even more power to manipulate stay there bob Chapman our
[02:04:51.680 --> 02:04:54.800]  guest straight ahead and your phone calls early in the hour i promise

[02:05:14.880 --> 02:05:19.120]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:05:19.120 --> 02:05:22.720]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country
[02:05:22.720 --> 02:05:27.200]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[02:05:27.200 --> 02:05:31.040]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[02:05:31.040 --> 02:05:34.240]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose

[02:11:18.160 --> 02:11:21.280]  and i noticed bob Chapman that there's a new redesign
[02:11:21.280 --> 02:11:25.440]  i liked the old design but the new design is kind of a web 2.0 look
[02:11:25.440 --> 02:11:29.680]  uh at the international forecaster tell us about those changes
[02:11:29.680 --> 02:11:35.600]  well the changes came about through uh having the same site for i guess about
[02:11:35.600 --> 02:11:39.360]  10 years and um actually i really didn't have
[02:11:39.360 --> 02:11:45.120]  much to do with it uh other people uh more talented in that area than i did it
[02:11:45.120 --> 02:11:49.120]  and i'm very happy with it and i hope everybody likes it and
[02:11:49.120 --> 02:11:52.320]  and we certainly get a lot of hits on that site for
[02:11:52.320 --> 02:11:55.440]  uh being an entity that doesn't advertise at all
[02:11:55.440 --> 02:12:00.800]  absolutely my friend now let's continue and then we're gonna go to calls we
[02:12:00.800 --> 02:12:03.920]  for those that just joined us we were getting into the future of the dollar
[02:12:03.920 --> 02:12:07.440]  what does it mean when the imf is in the news the last week and a half straight
[02:12:07.440 --> 02:12:10.880]  saying america is too much in debt you've got to love
[02:12:10.880 --> 02:12:14.240]  this consortium of bankers that publicly engineered this
[02:12:14.240 --> 02:12:17.280]  openly calling for themselves to be given world government power
[02:12:17.280 --> 02:12:20.160]  for us to pay them carbon taxes and they're in the news today
[02:12:20.160 --> 02:12:23.520]  all over the news saying the answer to your problems is
[02:12:23.520 --> 02:12:27.920]  cutting social security raising taxes and basically giving all your money
[02:12:27.920 --> 02:12:31.920]  uh to us uh what does it mean when the un and others
[02:12:31.920 --> 02:12:36.320]  start beating the drum for the dollar to lose its world reserve currency a what
[02:12:36.320 --> 02:12:41.520]  does that mean and b what will happen if that unfolds
[02:12:41.520 --> 02:12:46.320]  well first of all um it's the wrong thing to have austerity
[02:12:46.320 --> 02:12:52.080]  and to increase taxes simultaneously uh it's the best thing to do is to have
[02:12:52.080 --> 02:12:56.240]  austerity and cut taxes so that money will continue to
[02:12:56.240 --> 02:13:00.000]  fall a flow into the economy so that you don't have
[02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:05.840]  a dangerous and wretched depression uh as far as the
[02:13:05.840 --> 02:13:12.400]  the dollar being jettisoned uh the uh powers that be within the united
[02:13:12.400 --> 02:13:15.840]  states from behind the scenes banking and wall street
[02:13:15.840 --> 02:13:21.600]  they have ravaged the dollar uh ever since after the second world war and
[02:13:21.600 --> 02:13:27.600]  of course uh since august 15 1971 when uh we had the
[02:13:27.600 --> 02:13:32.240]  uh gold backing taken away from the dollar
[02:13:32.240 --> 02:13:36.000]  and it's been downhill since then and everybody is
[02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:39.680]  who who is in that genre is very well aware of it
[02:13:39.680 --> 02:13:43.440]  and so they finally decided that it's time
[02:13:43.440 --> 02:13:46.880]  that the dollar was replaced and they would like to use
[02:13:46.880 --> 02:13:52.560]  the sdr which is backed by nothing and so it's no better than the dollar or
[02:13:52.560 --> 02:13:57.280]  any other currency it's fiat as it's called and so
[02:13:57.280 --> 02:14:01.280]  and what they want to do is kick the ball off
[02:14:01.280 --> 02:14:06.080]  by getting carbon taxes passed in the united states and then
[02:14:06.080 --> 02:14:10.400]  throughout the world and part of those tax revenues will
[02:14:10.400 --> 02:14:17.760]  go to uh the imf and the world bank and they will
[02:14:17.760 --> 02:14:22.000]  back the sdr with income that comes from
[02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:26.480]  these carbon taxes at the same time uh there'll be a big meeting
[02:14:26.480 --> 02:14:31.120]  and like so many in the past and they will devalue
[02:14:31.120 --> 02:14:37.120]  or revalue all currencies versus the sdr and that'll be arbitrary in nature
[02:14:37.120 --> 02:14:41.280]  and then i think they will also have uh multilateral
[02:14:41.280 --> 02:14:48.160]  defaults among nations and uh the final configuration i don't know of yet
[02:14:48.160 --> 02:14:52.160]  as yet because we're not close enough to that happening but that's what i think
[02:14:52.160 --> 02:14:56.400]  they intend to do and that of course is why
[02:14:56.400 --> 02:15:00.160]  uh gold and silver are doing as well as they have
[02:15:00.160 --> 02:15:04.480]  uh because people are saying gee uh i don't want another fiat currency
[02:15:04.480 --> 02:15:07.600]  now that currency the sdr won't be used
[02:15:07.600 --> 02:15:12.400]  in karmas domestically by nations nations will still have
[02:15:12.400 --> 02:15:18.720]  their dollars and their pounds etc until they decide to make a change in that
[02:15:18.720 --> 02:15:22.480]  as well but for the time being i think they'll
[02:15:22.480 --> 02:15:28.000]  revalue and devalue the currencies versus the sdr i also feel
[02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.720]  and i was talking about that when the break came
[02:15:30.720 --> 02:15:36.560]  is that uh the european nations and the european banks
[02:15:36.560 --> 02:15:40.880]  are no better off now than they were two and a half to three years ago
[02:15:40.880 --> 02:15:44.400]  and neither are the banks in the united states
[02:15:44.400 --> 02:15:48.400]  and uh there's another crisis brewing
[02:15:48.400 --> 02:15:51.760]  uh nothing has been put the rest over there
[02:15:51.760 --> 02:15:57.680]  uh i think that eventually the weaker countries will pull away from the euro
[02:15:57.680 --> 02:16:02.560]  and i think it'll be abandoned and uh why i say that more than anything else
[02:16:02.560 --> 02:16:05.760]  is that not all the mistakes that they've made
[02:16:05.760 --> 02:16:10.080]  uh which should be uh uh uh prevalent
[02:16:10.080 --> 02:16:16.560]  uh to people who watch that scene uh but also i see in europe a movement toward
[02:16:16.560 --> 02:16:19.920]  decentralization they went into centralization with
[02:16:19.920 --> 02:16:23.120]  the euro and the european european union
[02:16:23.120 --> 02:16:26.800]  and it really hasn't worked very well uh the german public
[02:16:26.800 --> 02:16:32.640]  really wants to get out of both of them and uh i think they think it's time
[02:16:32.640 --> 02:16:38.400]  uh they think that was in part punishment for what went on during world war two
[02:16:38.400 --> 02:16:42.720]  uh as was the grievous price that they had to pay
[02:16:42.720 --> 02:16:47.200]  to join the two germanies together some time ago
[02:16:47.200 --> 02:16:54.080]  i guess it was in 1991-92 and and so i see disruption there
[02:16:54.080 --> 02:16:56.800]  well this is being reflected throughout the world
[02:16:56.800 --> 02:17:00.960]  i mean we've got all kinds of banks that are insolvent central banks
[02:17:00.960 --> 02:17:05.040]  we got the united states government particularly the treasury
[02:17:05.040 --> 02:17:07.920]  and other central banks along with the federal reserve
[02:17:07.920 --> 02:17:12.880]  who are trying to make and talk gold down for the last 25 years
[02:17:12.880 --> 02:17:17.760]  uh relatively unsuccessfully and i think what we're doing
[02:17:17.760 --> 02:17:21.520]  on talk radio as well as on the internet
[02:17:21.520 --> 02:17:25.920]  is really taking its toll and we talk about this every week
[02:17:25.920 --> 02:17:29.440]  and uh i heard you talk about it with david ike
[02:17:29.440 --> 02:17:34.240]  as well uh we got him on the run and we gotta keep in that way
[02:17:34.240 --> 02:17:38.880]  well australia has announced because their government's approval ratings are
[02:17:38.880 --> 02:17:42.800]  are literally in the low 20s and when the people are asked why are you
[02:17:42.800 --> 02:17:46.800]  angry we're angry about the carbon tax which is very draconian there the most
[02:17:46.800 --> 02:17:50.000]  draconian in the world we've seen where they just laid over half the country's
[02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:53.120]  land that people already owned that farmers were using off limits
[02:17:53.120 --> 02:17:56.960]  we're mad about the carbon tax we're mad about internet censorship
[02:17:56.960 --> 02:18:01.200]  and so they've now said okay we're gonna drop it for a year
[02:18:01.200 --> 02:18:05.120]  and they admitted because of an election coming up and i see this tactic
[02:18:05.120 --> 02:18:08.720]  constantly they can tell when we build up to a critical mass
[02:18:08.720 --> 02:18:12.400]  that if they continue to fight us we're gonna win so they always
[02:18:12.400 --> 02:18:16.160]  back off that's like twice in the last five years
[02:18:16.160 --> 02:18:19.600]  they were going to put illegal toll roads on 183 north
[02:18:19.600 --> 02:18:24.240]  moped pack 290 all the major roads of awesome where you can go nowhere
[02:18:24.240 --> 02:18:29.920]  i mean i live uh 15 miles uh at least from my office and i can get here
[02:18:29.920 --> 02:18:33.680]  in about 15 minutes because there's big nice highways that were built in the
[02:18:33.680 --> 02:18:37.200]  last two decades and i paid for them and they're all paid for
[02:18:37.200 --> 02:18:41.600]  and i paid for them with the gas tax and they admit this isn't even about
[02:18:41.600 --> 02:18:47.280]  paying for new roads this is about taxes because foreign center of spain has
[02:18:47.280 --> 02:18:51.680]  come in this is globalism and bought off politicians
[02:18:51.680 --> 02:18:55.040]  and so five years ago they were going to do it the people got mad they backed
[02:18:55.040 --> 02:18:57.520]  off then then about two and a half three years ago they said
[02:18:57.520 --> 02:19:00.640]  oh we never even said we were going to do it and now they've announced we don't
[02:19:00.640 --> 02:19:03.920]  care what you say we're taking three lanes and making two of them
[02:19:03.920 --> 02:19:07.760]  a toll road when that's illegal to make an existing road a toll road
[02:19:07.760 --> 02:19:11.280]  federal and state law and they just don't care and then we'll fight them
[02:19:11.280 --> 02:19:15.680]  again and they'll back off again they never give up we can never give up
[02:19:15.680 --> 02:19:19.040]  we need to understand that this is a 12 round fight here but
[02:19:19.040 --> 02:19:22.720]  what can you when we come back that that tactic they use bob because it makes me
[02:19:22.720 --> 02:19:27.200]  so angry well it's a strategic withdrawal
[02:19:27.200 --> 02:19:33.360]  it's uh dialectic in nature and uh
[02:19:33.360 --> 02:19:36.000]  and i'll come back with you yeah well yeah we'll talk about when you get back
[02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:39.680]  it just makes me so mad and of course it's Kirk Watson
[02:19:39.680 --> 02:19:42.000]  and everybody's got their local shyster like him
[02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:46.000]  this former mayor that literally stole tens of thousands of acres from people
[02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:49.520]  turned around and gave it to himself built things all over when it's supposed
[02:19:49.520 --> 02:19:52.880]  to be environmental preserves and now he's illegally

[02:24:21.840 --> 02:24:25.840]  okay bob getting into that point of strategic retreats
[02:24:25.840 --> 02:24:29.200]  because they know that we're not playing this conscious game of deception
[02:24:29.200 --> 02:24:32.640]  like they are and so every time that we reach critical mass they're going to
[02:24:32.640 --> 02:24:35.760]  beat them they retreat but only attack again especially
[02:24:35.760 --> 02:24:39.040]  like in a war someone's saying let's have a ceasefire you go okay and lower
[02:24:39.040 --> 02:24:42.640]  your guns and they shoot you in the chest
[02:24:42.640 --> 02:24:47.680]  continue commenting on that well they want us to lose momentum
[02:24:47.680 --> 02:24:51.360]  they want us to forget about it they want the public to forget about it
[02:24:51.360 --> 02:24:54.080]  and then they'll come back as stronger than ever
[02:24:54.080 --> 02:24:58.480]  and only we're going to be waiting for them because we know their tactics
[02:24:58.480 --> 02:25:02.240]  and our listeners are gaining knowledge
[02:25:02.240 --> 02:25:06.640]  in the games that are played well plus it shows what crooks they are that they
[02:25:06.640 --> 02:25:09.920]  constantly internationally nationally and locally
[02:25:09.920 --> 02:25:14.720]  lie and say we're done it's never going to happen and then they come back again
[02:25:14.720 --> 02:25:18.400]  you know it's kind of like zombies but anyway
[02:25:18.400 --> 02:25:22.560]  you like that but anyway um and that's what their game is
[02:25:22.560 --> 02:25:27.440]  um i was reading a piece uh by carol quigley today who
[02:25:27.440 --> 02:25:32.480]  wrote the 1965 about what the alumnus were going to do and spelled it all out
[02:25:32.480 --> 02:25:36.560]  i i was amazed at the time that he wrote the book
[02:25:36.560 --> 02:25:42.080]  uh but it shows you uh maybe in modern times the beginning of their arrogance
[02:25:42.080 --> 02:25:45.760]  and you know Freud and others touched upon
[02:25:45.760 --> 02:25:49.520]  uh the control of the masses in fact i'm running a piece
[02:25:49.520 --> 02:25:53.200]  along with all of those uh links from uh
[02:25:53.200 --> 02:25:57.760]  info wars i must have six or seven of them on there and uh because they're
[02:25:57.760 --> 02:26:01.040]  great and so uh if you don't mind i'll continue to
[02:26:01.040 --> 02:26:07.600]  run them and uh and so we're talking about the control
[02:26:07.600 --> 02:26:11.840]  of the minds of americans and people throughout the world
[02:26:11.840 --> 02:26:15.840]  and uh we're going to be at the wrong game by telling people the truth
[02:26:15.840 --> 02:26:19.760]  and telling the people that this is what they're doing to you
[02:26:19.760 --> 02:26:23.200]  with the media you may not realize that
[02:26:23.200 --> 02:26:27.840]  uh you may have a high school degree or a couple years of college or even a
[02:26:27.840 --> 02:26:30.480]  degree but you're not trained in that area and
[02:26:30.480 --> 02:26:34.720]  you don't see the things that we see i know what i wouldn't counter
[02:26:34.720 --> 02:26:37.360]  intelligence one of the first things that we read about
[02:26:37.360 --> 02:26:42.160]  was brainwashing that's what it was called in the early 1950s
[02:26:42.160 --> 02:26:46.240]  and uh and and so it hasn't really changed a lot
[02:26:46.240 --> 02:26:51.280]  since then except it's become more sophisticated and the depth of knowledge
[02:26:51.280 --> 02:26:54.080]  is far greater but don't let them fool you
[02:26:54.080 --> 02:26:57.680]  uh we're here for a reason and we're here to help you
[02:26:57.680 --> 02:27:02.000]  and uh and that's why we do what we do especially me at my age
[02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:05.840]  and uh and so let's keep the pressure on them
[02:27:05.840 --> 02:27:12.720]  and when they ease up we'll remind them we know what you're doing
[02:27:12.720 --> 02:27:15.520]  well they know that the momentum is shifting against them before we get
[02:27:15.520 --> 02:27:18.560]  back into the economy and then calls the next segment
[02:27:18.560 --> 02:27:21.600]  they won an iran war and and now it's just all over the news that they're
[02:27:21.600 --> 02:27:24.880]  going to go ahead and strike iran maybe even use nukes on them
[02:27:24.880 --> 02:27:29.040]  i mean i guess even though they know it's going to be unpopular and illegal
[02:27:29.040 --> 02:27:32.080]  they've got to do it as a political distraction
[02:27:32.080 --> 02:27:36.080]  because everything else they're doing is falling apart
[02:27:36.080 --> 02:27:39.760]  that's right and you know how do we explain
[02:27:39.760 --> 02:27:48.480]  this plethora of warships and marine personnel off of Costa Rica
[02:27:48.480 --> 02:27:52.960]  oh that's another take on that 44 ships the governments voted to allow
[02:27:52.960 --> 02:27:57.120]  troops and marines and helicopters and armored vehicles on the land to fight
[02:27:57.120 --> 02:28:00.160]  drug dealers and it sounds like some kind of bizarre
[02:28:00.160 --> 02:28:04.880]  coup like the government of Costa Rica is bringing the us in
[02:28:04.880 --> 02:28:07.600]  ahead of them being voted out in elections i mean that's all you can see
[02:28:07.600 --> 02:28:13.120]  of us now Costa Rica i guess is i mean you know has to be invaded
[02:28:13.120 --> 02:28:19.520]  well i live there and uh you know it's it's a great center for
[02:28:19.520 --> 02:28:24.000]  laundering money but in the time i lived there
[02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:28.400]  there was very little drugs in the country
[02:28:28.400 --> 02:28:34.240]  and uh uh you know i i maybe you're right about the politics but
[02:28:34.240 --> 02:28:37.840]  you know i know many people and families
[02:28:37.840 --> 02:28:42.160]  who are quote at the top of the government and uh
[02:28:42.160 --> 02:28:46.320]  you know there isn't a lot of difference between either party
[02:28:46.320 --> 02:28:52.080]  um i find it hard to buy that the new president which is a lady
[02:28:52.080 --> 02:28:57.680]  i think her name is chihuahua uh or something similar to that
[02:28:57.680 --> 02:29:02.480]  uh please excuse me if i'm wrong uh i don't know that
[02:29:02.480 --> 02:29:06.960]  there's a political problem i i really can't figure out what they're doing
[02:29:06.960 --> 02:29:09.520]  there yet
[02:29:10.080 --> 02:29:14.320]  i sure can figure out what's going off on in the in the persian golf
[02:29:14.320 --> 02:29:19.840]  i mean that's very obvious as you said uh they're right getting ready to go
[02:29:19.840 --> 02:29:24.160]  well i tell you uh if you look at granada and then you look again at Panama
[02:29:24.160 --> 02:29:27.280]  they use the same lie both times they would say terrorist
[02:29:27.280 --> 02:29:30.160]  and this is a hundred percent was there was some truth to it in
[02:29:30.160 --> 02:29:34.560]  in uh in the island but with the case of Panama
[02:29:34.560 --> 02:29:38.400]  they just claimed that college students have been kidnapped
[02:29:38.400 --> 02:29:41.760]  and then it was on local news and even came out in some u.s news that
[02:29:41.760 --> 02:29:45.200]  they went to the dormitory and the girl said no one was holding this hostage
[02:29:45.200 --> 02:29:48.640]  and they just invaded and blew the hell out of Panama city for no reason
[02:29:48.640 --> 02:29:52.480]  but that manual noriega was gonna well we're on the march

[02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:22.480]  right there's a guy outside the games and you know what i'm talking about
[02:33:22.480 --> 02:33:27.200]  just let me know if you want to go
[02:33:27.200 --> 02:33:32.560]  to that home out. Bob shaman is our guest going to your phone calls
[02:33:32.560 --> 02:33:36.320]  here momentarily on this live friday edition
[02:33:36.320 --> 02:33:42.080]  we have the sheriff who's got a mexican hit out on him a contract out on him
[02:33:42.080 --> 02:33:47.120]  joining us coming up in the next hour very
[02:33:47.120 --> 02:33:52.880]  important information but bob getting back into the economy
[02:33:52.880 --> 02:33:55.520]  because we only spoke a few minutes about that
[02:33:55.520 --> 02:33:59.440]  why do you think they're finally announcing
[02:33:59.440 --> 02:34:02.640]  in cnbc and the new york times and just everywhere
[02:34:02.640 --> 02:34:06.240]  okay it's a depression i mean i mean my answer is because now they're going to
[02:34:06.240 --> 02:34:10.160]  settle us the next solution giving the very bankers that did this more power
[02:34:10.160 --> 02:34:13.040]  i hate to even call them bankers because there are real banks and
[02:34:13.040 --> 02:34:16.400]  real banks that loan money locally that do a good job in many cases
[02:34:16.400 --> 02:34:21.520]  but these swindlers these money changers these globalists that pose
[02:34:21.520 --> 02:34:25.280]  as bankers these Ponzi scheme operators i mean what does it mean though to have
[02:34:25.280 --> 02:34:29.040]  them signifying that we are going into a depression i mean is it because they
[02:34:29.040 --> 02:34:32.240]  know the public isn't buying it anymore that we're in a recovery
[02:34:32.240 --> 02:34:34.720]  i mean we go from them saying we're in a recovery
[02:34:34.720 --> 02:34:38.160]  to maybe it's a double depression overnight to
[02:34:38.160 --> 02:34:44.560]  it's a depression well i think that um the public realizes
[02:34:44.560 --> 02:34:48.240]  that something dramatically wrong what they call it is irrelevant
[02:34:48.240 --> 02:34:55.520]  and the recognition of that by the media may have come about
[02:34:55.520 --> 02:34:59.600]  because of the tremendous outside pressures that we've created
[02:34:59.600 --> 02:35:07.360]  and i think that it could also be that and i put this in the
[02:35:07.360 --> 02:35:11.760]  international forecaster not too long ago i've been told
[02:35:11.760 --> 02:35:18.400]  because congress has refused to provide funds for the extension of
[02:35:18.400 --> 02:35:22.480]  unemployment that they won't provide funds for stimulus
[02:35:22.480 --> 02:35:28.000]  and that means that the federal reserve is going to have to supply the money
[02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:31.440]  and i've been told that over the next two and a half years
[02:35:31.440 --> 02:35:36.320]  approximately then they're going to apply about five trillion
[02:35:36.320 --> 02:35:41.280]  dollars to the economy and so if major media was saying
[02:35:41.280 --> 02:35:45.360]  gee it's not it's going to be a double dip recession
[02:35:45.360 --> 02:35:49.520]  and you know woe is me and on all of a sudden
[02:35:49.520 --> 02:35:53.600]  perhaps several months from now everything starts to turn around the
[02:35:53.600 --> 02:35:57.600]  and the media would say well and that's the people who said these things
[02:35:57.600 --> 02:36:01.600]  that well look i i guess we were wrong things are turning around
[02:36:01.600 --> 02:36:07.280]  and and it's going to be okay and so they can you know go with the other side
[02:36:07.280 --> 02:36:11.200]  but that's what i think is going to happen it'll be very inflationary
[02:36:11.200 --> 02:36:16.400]  it'll probably keep the stock market from plunging where it should plunge to
[02:36:16.400 --> 02:36:19.680]  on a short-term basis but the market's still going to go down
[02:36:19.680 --> 02:36:26.160]  to reflect a lower earnings and a lower GDP during the second half of this year
[02:36:26.160 --> 02:36:30.240]  and i think you're seeing that in the market now yes we had
[02:36:30.240 --> 02:36:34.160]  a couple of a couple of mini recoveries one during the last week
[02:36:34.160 --> 02:36:38.720]  which wall street would call a call a dead cat bounce
[02:36:38.720 --> 02:36:42.640]  and uh... i think we're going down to the eight thousand eighty five hundred
[02:36:42.640 --> 02:36:46.880]  uh... area i hear prior to the election we could go deeper
[02:36:46.880 --> 02:36:50.080]  and it's because the fundamentals just aren't there
[02:36:50.080 --> 02:36:52.720]  uh... through stimulus and through the fed
[02:36:52.720 --> 02:36:56.160]  uh... both are producing about two point three trillion dollars
[02:36:56.160 --> 02:36:59.520]  all we did was go sideways for a little over a year
[02:36:59.520 --> 02:37:04.480]  and slightly higher in gdp very little was accomplished
[02:37:04.480 --> 02:37:09.520]  unemployment of the second half of the year easily twenty five percent
[02:37:09.520 --> 02:37:13.120]  uh... in real rates and then you have all these people
[02:37:13.120 --> 02:37:16.800]  who are going to be roaming around too many of them without checks anymore
[02:37:16.800 --> 02:37:20.880]  they're not going to be very happy so i think august and september
[02:37:20.880 --> 02:37:24.320]  uh... are going to be volatile months because i think a lot of people are
[02:37:24.320 --> 02:37:26.960]  going to be complaining some might demonstrate
[02:37:26.960 --> 02:37:31.680]  uh... they could possibly be riots but i i don't foresee that
[02:37:31.680 --> 02:37:34.720]  at least in my mind's eye at this point in time
[02:37:34.720 --> 02:37:39.280]  and so you're going to have a a lower stock market
[02:37:39.280 --> 02:37:42.560]  and uh... there's going to be a lot of people who are going to be disgruntled
[02:37:42.560 --> 02:37:46.000]  about that because the value of their pensions and their
[02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:48.880]  cash parity license life insurance policies
[02:37:48.880 --> 02:37:53.760]  and also your um annuity is going to go down in value
[02:37:53.760 --> 02:37:56.400]  because the stocks are going down and they own them
[02:37:56.400 --> 02:38:01.520]  and so it's not a happy time and uh... even if the fed throws money at the
[02:38:01.520 --> 02:38:05.200]  whole thing will it work
[02:38:05.200 --> 02:38:08.800]  well regardless now is the time to get the maximum effort out because the
[02:38:08.800 --> 02:38:12.400]  system is trying to use the crisis they've created
[02:38:12.400 --> 02:38:16.720]  to remake the world in their image where they have even more power to control
[02:38:16.720 --> 02:38:20.640]  our lives and become even more wealthy and it's critical that during this
[02:38:20.640 --> 02:38:22.800]  crisis when people are actually ready to listen
[02:38:22.800 --> 02:38:26.800]  that we tell the truth so there's an alternative to their tyranny
[02:38:26.800 --> 02:38:29.680]  uh... so this is such an important crossroads
[02:38:29.680 --> 02:38:32.720]  such an important critical time in history
[02:38:32.720 --> 02:38:37.280]  let's go to shanky in georgia you're on the air with bob shatman go ahead
[02:38:37.280 --> 02:38:41.040]  hey guys uh thanks for having me on uh alex just want to let you know it
[02:38:41.040 --> 02:38:44.880]  became a prison planet member a couple weeks ago and the videos on there
[02:38:44.880 --> 02:38:50.160]  really are over the top unbelievable formative really well done
[02:38:50.160 --> 02:38:53.120]  i've really enjoyed being a member over there
[02:38:53.120 --> 02:38:56.800]  um i think you're right it was bob and y'all right with
[02:38:56.800 --> 02:39:01.920]  uh radio and the internet being the main vehicles to keep us all motivated
[02:39:01.920 --> 02:39:06.400]  and uh getting the word out that is you know as long as we have
[02:39:06.400 --> 02:39:10.160]  the internet you know they wouldn't be trying to shut the web down worldwide
[02:39:10.160 --> 02:39:13.680]  and free speech down in curtail it if it was ineffective there
[02:39:13.680 --> 02:39:16.480]  they're now openly saying they want to shut it down
[02:39:16.480 --> 02:39:19.680]  which is a big blow for them to have to come out and say it shows what tyrants
[02:39:19.680 --> 02:39:22.720]  they are they wouldn't be doing this if it didn't have power
[02:39:22.720 --> 02:39:25.920]  alex let me give you kudos on one thing you're the only person
[02:39:25.920 --> 02:39:29.760]  on the planet to point out that little brawn didn't go to chicago
[02:39:29.760 --> 02:39:34.880]  because illinois got 13 billion in debt and he's not going to go to a city of
[02:39:34.880 --> 02:39:38.960]  state that says it's underwater want to give a kudos for that well i mean
[02:39:38.960 --> 02:39:43.440]  that's how i knew and and and of course jaren pointed this out as well
[02:39:43.440 --> 02:39:47.680]  uh to me that florida doesn't have a state income tax like texas and a few
[02:39:47.680 --> 02:39:51.840]  others and so of course he's going to go there if he's getting a
[02:39:51.840 --> 02:39:55.440]  what's his contract 99 million or something i mean he's got this giant
[02:39:55.440 --> 02:39:59.840]  contract he is going to go where he gets to keep
[02:39:59.840 --> 02:40:02.800]  more of that if you've got a five 10 15 percent
[02:40:02.800 --> 02:40:06.000]  state income tax like some states have even higher
[02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:09.280]  why would someone give up 15 million dollars to go to
[02:40:09.280 --> 02:40:13.040]  chicago uh or somewhere else why wouldn't they keep it i mean
[02:40:13.040 --> 02:40:15.920]  and that's why everybody's leaving england and people are leaving france
[02:40:15.920 --> 02:40:20.320]  and that's why the un has said over and over again and so is the oecd
[02:40:20.320 --> 02:40:24.960]  this big global management group that they want worldwide taxes the new world
[02:40:24.960 --> 02:40:28.240]  order first and foremost is about unified taxes
[02:40:28.240 --> 02:40:31.040]  so they can jack them up and up and up and no one can run let's get a quick
[02:40:31.040 --> 02:40:35.120]  comment on that from bob and you can come back shanky go ahead bob
[02:40:35.120 --> 02:40:39.520]  that is certainly true and these banks and these countries all over the world
[02:40:39.520 --> 02:40:45.040]  are following oecd guidelines right to a t it just isn't you know the us
[02:40:45.040 --> 02:40:50.640]  pushing the issue it is the oecd and they are doing it
[02:40:50.640 --> 02:40:54.960]  uh... most countries uh... that i know of
[02:40:54.960 --> 02:40:58.160]  uh... question everything that goes through your account
[02:40:58.160 --> 02:41:03.200]  and you know they want to know well uh... you just uh... received
[02:41:03.200 --> 02:41:08.160]  uh... a hundred thousand dollars uh... check from xyz company
[02:41:08.160 --> 02:41:12.240]  in the united states uh... they go into your account in mexico city
[02:41:12.240 --> 02:41:16.320]  uh... uh... what did you do that and then the companies as well
[02:41:16.320 --> 02:41:20.400]  in our own business and we felt like the united state and then meanwhile and then
[02:41:20.400 --> 02:41:22.720]  meanwhile you came from heaven
[02:41:22.720 --> 02:41:26.400]  exactly but then meanwhile hundreds of billions of dollars of drug money
[02:41:26.400 --> 02:41:29.840]  are laundered by federal reserve mega bank members shareholders
[02:41:29.840 --> 02:41:33.520]  and that's not an issue that's left alone but now they're trying to change irs
[02:41:33.520 --> 02:41:36.480]  regulations and i actually got an email about this people wanted me to ask you
[02:41:36.480 --> 02:41:40.240]  where six hundred dollars if you sell a six hundred dollar use
[02:41:40.240 --> 02:41:43.840]  riding lawnmower they're saying it's going to be a federal felony
[02:41:43.840 --> 02:41:47.440]  if you don't report that and pay taxes they know the underground economy
[02:41:47.440 --> 02:41:50.880]  is keeping america hanging on they want us bankrupt
[02:41:50.880 --> 02:41:55.440]  and so they're gonna harass some carwash in
[02:41:55.440 --> 02:41:58.960]  california for a four cent unpaid tax bill
[02:41:58.960 --> 02:42:03.440]  and that was in the news up in sacramento the irish hope with armed agents but
[02:42:03.440 --> 02:42:06.400]  meanwhile hundreds of billions are in the banks of drug money that's not going
[02:42:06.400 --> 02:42:11.920]  to be looked at that's right and what are we talking about we're talking about
[02:42:11.920 --> 02:42:15.920]  uh... about three quarters of a trillion dollars a year
[02:42:15.920 --> 02:42:20.320]  and uh... about three hundred billion dollars of that comes out of afghanistan
[02:42:20.320 --> 02:42:24.560]  in the form marijuana and which of what eventually becomes heroin
[02:42:24.560 --> 02:42:30.720]  you you mean opium yeah i guess who's running it
[02:42:30.720 --> 02:42:34.320]  well they had met our governments growing the opium over there uh... let's uh...
[02:42:34.320 --> 02:42:39.040]  anything else shanky yeah real quick uh... bob's got a great post on your
[02:42:39.040 --> 02:42:42.640]  site witness a recent gold market takedowns and he's he's got a statement
[02:42:42.640 --> 02:42:45.680]  in there says the result of the stretcher is you coming with the
[02:42:45.680 --> 02:42:49.360]  colleague hope complete collapse of the stock market in the end of real estate
[02:42:49.360 --> 02:42:52.640]  you know as an investment the powers that uh...
[02:42:52.640 --> 02:42:57.680]  it bob talk a little bit more about the gold manipulation if you can sum it up
[02:42:57.680 --> 02:43:01.520]  in a few minutes and i'll hang up i'd have a real fast i mean i could boil it
[02:43:01.520 --> 02:43:03.520]  down to get bob's take it's very simple
[02:43:03.520 --> 02:43:06.560]  they it's like a beach ball they could push it down but it always goes up even
[02:43:06.560 --> 02:43:09.600]  higher you look at the year long of the two year of the five year
[02:43:09.600 --> 02:43:13.840]  or the seven-year graph it's straight up uh... but the manipulation is damaging
[02:43:13.840 --> 02:43:17.680]  the economy bob tell folks and and they started
[02:43:17.680 --> 02:43:21.840]  that sixty eight illegally it became legal in eighty eight through the
[02:43:21.840 --> 02:43:27.360]  working group and then a financial markets uh... a uh... executive order
[02:43:27.360 --> 02:43:31.840]  and it's not only gold and silver market they're manipulating everything
[02:43:31.840 --> 02:43:35.360]  i mean this is truly a corporate as fascist economy
[02:43:35.360 --> 02:43:40.560]  and yes as the gentleman said uh... and you did as well alex
[02:43:40.560 --> 02:43:44.400]  uh... it's like a beach ball and uh... yeah they could push it under but it
[02:43:44.400 --> 02:43:48.800]  comes popping right back up again and uh... it's going to continue to do that
[02:43:48.800 --> 02:43:51.680]  because it's the only real money in the world
[02:43:51.680 --> 02:43:55.920]  well said let's go to another caller let's talk to duff in kansas you're on

[02:44:24.240 --> 02:44:29.040]  uh... hail you once again for all your efforts to continue to expose these
[02:44:29.040 --> 02:44:32.720]  people listen this morning you were talking about conditioning
[02:44:32.720 --> 02:44:37.760]  and how they use celebrities you know to make us think that these people
[02:44:37.760 --> 02:44:42.800]  or something that they really aren't you know hollywood's been using films
[02:44:42.800 --> 02:44:46.960]  for a number of years to condition us into believing certain things
[02:44:46.960 --> 02:44:50.960]  now hold on to your hat i watched the movie last night called
[02:44:50.960 --> 02:44:55.920]  thirteen the conspiracy and they constantly refer to the new world order
[02:44:55.920 --> 02:45:00.880]  in the film all these uh... an assassination attempt takes place
[02:45:00.880 --> 02:45:04.320]  actually it becomes a reality where they assassinate the president
[02:45:04.320 --> 02:45:09.040]  and they use this as a premise to show people that this new world order is
[02:45:09.040 --> 02:45:13.440]  needed desperately to bring control and put an end to the violence in the
[02:45:13.440 --> 02:45:16.400]  country they've been doing this for so long
[02:45:16.400 --> 02:45:20.240]  it's actually gotten to the point where it's ridiculous really so in this
[02:45:20.240 --> 02:45:23.440]  movie they sell world government is this is a savior
[02:45:23.440 --> 02:45:27.680]  exactly now i was uh... a question for mr chappan today is he there
[02:45:27.680 --> 02:45:30.080]  yes and we have
[02:45:30.080 --> 02:45:31.280]  yeah bob listen
[02:45:31.280 --> 02:45:35.280]  i i know that you would you know how the answer is a lot of these questions and
[02:45:35.280 --> 02:45:37.840]  my big question is that
[02:45:37.840 --> 02:45:41.080]  and are you aware of all of our time frame
[02:45:41.080 --> 02:45:44.240]  that we would could set ourselves up to know when
[02:45:44.240 --> 02:45:47.360]  they're going to come about with this national ID card
[02:45:47.360 --> 02:45:50.000]  and if in fact that is going to become a reality
[02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:54.800]  you believe that that is a prelude to the mark of the beast
[02:45:54.800 --> 02:45:58.880]  well first of all uh... timing in here is so difficult
[02:45:58.880 --> 02:46:01.840]  because we're for forcing them to change their plans
[02:46:01.840 --> 02:46:06.000]  well we're forcing them to make mistakes uh... they never thought grief would
[02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:09.600]  turn out the way it has uh... with the great people saying hey we don't want to
[02:46:09.600 --> 02:46:12.800]  do that and so there are things that are happening
[02:46:12.800 --> 02:46:16.160]  changing things so you really can't put a timeline on it
[02:46:16.160 --> 02:46:19.200]  all you can do is tell people this is really what they want to do and let's
[02:46:19.200 --> 02:46:20.800]  not let them do it
[02:46:20.800 --> 02:46:25.520]  and you know filed your complaints with your uh... elected members and
[02:46:25.520 --> 02:46:30.080]  in hope it does some good but timing's too hard
[02:46:30.080 --> 02:46:33.600]  the timing uh... in the middle east right now is not too difficult
[02:46:33.600 --> 02:46:36.720]  i think how many vessels do they have there and
[02:46:36.720 --> 02:46:40.880]  and how many planes and and how many hundreds of thousands of people
[02:46:40.880 --> 02:46:44.320]  ready to attack uh... you've got any who visiting and they're saying they're
[02:46:44.320 --> 02:46:47.840]  getting ready for war let me let me comment on this uh... the mark of the
[02:46:47.840 --> 02:46:50.720]  beast is here the casual society is here in my
[02:46:50.720 --> 02:46:55.200]  first film a thirteen years ago america destroyed by design
[02:46:55.200 --> 02:46:58.960]  i have bill clinton's executive order to take blood and other dna to go drivers
[02:46:58.960 --> 02:47:02.800]  license to biometrically face scan and thumb print
[02:47:02.800 --> 02:47:06.000]  and they'll have to have basically a driver's license to have a job
[02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:10.800]  now what they do is they bring in a spp north american uh... union
[02:47:10.800 --> 02:47:14.640]  they issue a hemispheric travel card which they've already issued if you choose
[02:47:14.640 --> 02:47:18.080]  to get it uh... for his uh... for a mexicans
[02:47:18.080 --> 02:47:22.560]  uh... americans and canadians so all of that is going on
[02:47:22.560 --> 02:47:26.640]  uh... already all fifty states have standardized their drivers license
[02:47:26.640 --> 02:47:30.160]  to the fed summer fighting against new regulations
[02:47:30.160 --> 02:47:34.560]  they just pass a a a a a a random real id law and then they can just keep
[02:47:34.560 --> 02:47:37.760]  adding regulations uh... on that blank check
[02:47:37.760 --> 02:47:41.840]  they're putting thumb printers in attending salons at gyms
[02:47:41.840 --> 02:47:45.440]  uh... at restaurants at people to clock in at work
[02:47:45.440 --> 02:47:48.960]  uh... in pennsylvania and other areas inside the stores
[02:47:48.960 --> 02:47:52.400]  the grocery stores basically won't and this is mainstream news today in fact
[02:47:52.400 --> 02:47:55.840]  give me a close shot of this the the the grocery stores
[02:47:55.840 --> 02:47:59.840]  uh... won't be allowed to sell you beer because they can't be trusted
[02:47:59.840 --> 02:48:03.520]  you'll have to go and face scan and breathalyzer
[02:48:03.520 --> 02:48:07.360]  uh... and swipe your id card to buy alcohol they're gonna have a new
[02:48:07.360 --> 02:48:11.200]  national sales tax this is all been stated that's going to be graduated so
[02:48:11.200 --> 02:48:14.560]  quote poor people don't have to pay it and so you'll have to swipe your card
[02:48:14.560 --> 02:48:17.680]  though to prove what bracket you're in because there'd be fraud if there wasn't
[02:48:17.680 --> 02:48:20.640]  you'd have somebody who made less than you go buy something
[02:48:20.640 --> 02:48:23.840]  so that tracks everything you're doing uh... we're here
[02:48:23.840 --> 02:48:27.760]  uh... we have a national id card in 2000 the un had a meeting in australia
[02:48:27.760 --> 02:48:31.280]  it was in their papers that a global standardization for ids
[02:48:31.280 --> 02:48:35.600]  and the numbers and the precepts have been set we already have a global id
[02:48:35.600 --> 02:48:39.680]  libya iran a few other countries haven't adopted it
[02:48:39.680 --> 02:48:42.960]  okay just like they've been taking your blood for 38 years secretly for dna
[02:48:42.960 --> 02:48:45.680]  databases at birth now they admit it just like they've been
[02:48:45.680 --> 02:48:50.080]  fluoridating worldwide in the west same standardization one part per million
[02:48:50.080 --> 02:48:53.920]  that we are already in a global managed system the oecd
[02:48:53.920 --> 02:48:57.040]  the corporation set up to take over europe after world war two
[02:48:57.040 --> 02:49:00.720]  is a private corporate consortium just like the wto over trade
[02:49:00.720 --> 02:49:04.560]  they decide everything financial they decide how many numbers are on your
[02:49:04.560 --> 02:49:07.600]  driver's license they decide just like i've had all these members of parliament
[02:49:07.600 --> 02:49:10.480]  on from england over 70 percent of their laws
[02:49:10.480 --> 02:49:14.080]  our e you decided well bush this last year in office
[02:49:14.080 --> 02:49:18.080]  signed the transatlantic alliance merging the north american union with the
[02:49:18.080 --> 02:49:20.640]  euro he gave a press conference saying
[02:49:20.640 --> 02:49:25.920]  we had now merged in 2000 they had the 50th anniversary of the euro
[02:49:25.920 --> 02:49:30.560]  in all of the member countries with huge marches and fireworks literally no one
[02:49:30.560 --> 02:49:33.440]  you know showed up you'd have parades with no one there
[02:49:33.440 --> 02:49:39.600]  and they celebrated 50 years in 2000 but excuse me in 2007 because it really
[02:49:39.600 --> 02:49:43.200]  was set up in 1957 with the treaty of rome
[02:49:43.200 --> 02:49:47.840]  though they officially set up the euro in 2000 we're in a global government now
[02:49:47.840 --> 02:49:51.840]  bob Chapman i agree with that in fact i just
[02:49:51.840 --> 02:49:56.320]  wrote an article in the last issue and i'm continuing the coming issue
[02:49:56.320 --> 02:49:59.360]  about europe and its evolutionary process from
[02:49:59.360 --> 02:50:03.680]  the common market and after which i live through because i live in europe at the
[02:50:03.680 --> 02:50:09.120]  time and in the treaty of rome and uh... and onward into the g a t t and then
[02:50:09.120 --> 02:50:12.960]  wto and and uh... to the uh...
[02:50:12.960 --> 02:50:16.960]  place that we're at today particularly uh... in
[02:50:16.960 --> 02:50:21.120]  in view of uh... uh... their accomplishment in
[02:50:21.120 --> 02:50:24.720]  uh... pre trade globalization offshoring up so i think
[02:50:24.720 --> 02:50:28.880]  and uh... i think their system in europe is breaking down
[02:50:28.880 --> 02:50:32.960]  i think they're having a heck of a time not only financially and economically
[02:50:32.960 --> 02:50:37.440]  but nobody wants to play anymore and so that's why i think the
[02:50:37.440 --> 02:50:41.600]  the euro is going to be history and it may even break up the EU
[02:50:41.600 --> 02:50:44.640]  stay there if you want to break up with more calls and we'll keep you five

[02:54:43.840 --> 02:54:47.840]  did this piece it shows of the evolution of communism
[02:54:47.840 --> 02:54:52.160]  the parasitic system the kingdom of the parasites
[02:54:52.160 --> 02:54:58.160]  and it shows and instead of the you know evolutionary going from a ape
[02:54:58.160 --> 02:55:03.360]  like creature to modern man it degenerates downwards from Barack
[02:55:03.360 --> 02:55:09.040]  Obama to Michael Moore to linen and Stalin and then
[02:55:09.040 --> 02:55:14.560]  Karl Marx yeah ben pack did that so we've got
[02:55:14.560 --> 02:55:19.680]  that up on info wars.com right now it's really talented

[02:55:27.040 --> 02:55:30.800]  thank you for having me good afternoon gentlemen hello
[02:55:30.800 --> 02:55:36.480]  um i have a quick comment and a question that's related to the comment and i'm
[02:55:36.480 --> 02:55:42.000]  going to have to ask uh mr Chapman to put on his intel officer hat
[02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:49.280]  here for just a minute if he would um the comment is uh you uh at uh mr
[02:55:49.280 --> 02:55:52.960]  jones we're talking earlier about israel's
[02:55:52.960 --> 02:55:57.920]  um nuclear arsenal and uh you may not have been
[02:55:57.920 --> 02:56:01.600]  meaning it this way but it seems to me that you're sort of saying that israel
[02:56:01.600 --> 02:56:05.120]  is getting away with something having these nuclear weapons
[02:56:05.120 --> 02:56:10.160]  when they really weren't the what they did was that when it came to sign
[02:56:10.160 --> 02:56:14.320]  came time to sign up to the uh nonproliferation treaty
[02:56:14.320 --> 02:56:18.560]  they just said no uh and they weren't no no no i mean you misunderstand what i
[02:56:18.560 --> 02:56:22.240]  was saying israel has always said that they don't have nukes and in the last
[02:56:22.240 --> 02:56:24.720]  few years they said well if we do it's a secret
[02:56:24.720 --> 02:56:28.800]  i agree nobody has to sign on to these united nations treaties
[02:56:28.800 --> 02:56:32.240]  uh and and uh israel shouldn't have to and either should i ran
[02:56:32.240 --> 02:56:36.400]  my issue is i'm against a preemptive nuclear attack on iran
[02:56:36.400 --> 02:56:42.320]  that is mass murder that is evil i mean i i mean look the nazis thought they
[02:56:42.320 --> 02:56:45.200]  were doing good the communists thought they were doing good
[02:56:45.200 --> 02:56:48.000]  our country thought it was doing good killing native americans
[02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:53.360]  this is wrong we can't let this happen our government has overthrown iran
[02:56:53.360 --> 02:56:57.600]  repeatedly you know bp used to literally rule iran it had a previous
[02:56:57.600 --> 02:57:03.120]  name anglo-american oil uh inside iran i mean iran isn't perfect and i'm not
[02:57:03.120 --> 02:57:07.520]  you know buddies with iran i'm against new king innocent countries i'm
[02:57:07.520 --> 02:57:11.440]  against lying about wmds in iraq and the majority of republicans are now on
[02:57:11.440 --> 02:57:14.640]  records saying they were against you know that now they think the iraq war was
[02:57:14.640 --> 02:57:18.080]  wrong bob shabin what's your take on this
[02:57:18.080 --> 02:57:23.600]  exactly the same as yours that was the anglo- iranian oil company
[02:57:23.600 --> 02:57:28.960]  and uh they the people who overthrew uh muhamad muhamad mazadak
[02:57:28.960 --> 02:57:32.080]  and that's how the shark came to power power that's right it had a bunch of
[02:57:32.080 --> 02:57:38.160]  different names iran co anglo-american anglo iran i mean bp is always changing
[02:57:38.160 --> 02:57:41.600]  their name and after this latest fiasco they'll change it again
[02:57:41.600 --> 02:57:44.560]  that's all that's not what i'm trying to say the only i'm trying to say is there's
[02:57:44.560 --> 02:57:50.000]  a way out of the npt there's article 13 you give your three months notice
[02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:53.520]  and you're out of the you're out of the npt that's what the that's what north
[02:57:53.520 --> 02:57:57.200]  korea did when they when they realized that we were actually
[02:57:57.200 --> 02:58:01.280]  serious about them being in the npt and wanted to send investigators in there
[02:58:01.280 --> 02:58:04.480]  they said oh you oh you mean this is like serious we actually have to be
[02:58:04.480 --> 02:58:07.920]  members of the npt to the point where we have to accept your inspectors
[02:58:07.920 --> 02:58:12.160]  no thanks okay we're out of here and they gave their three months notice and
[02:58:12.160 --> 02:58:15.840]  they left the npt so what i don't understand
[02:58:15.840 --> 02:58:19.920]  is why the iranians don't just call our bluff
[02:58:19.920 --> 02:58:25.040]  why they don't just go listen listen listen five years ago they had a soft
[02:58:25.040 --> 02:58:28.880]  line guy in there who had all the inspectors in the un said no one had
[02:58:28.880 --> 02:58:32.640]  ever allowed this level of inspection they will they need reactors
[02:58:32.640 --> 02:58:37.200]  they can only refine half the oil they need i mean they really want a peaceful
[02:58:37.200 --> 02:58:42.880]  program
[02:58:42.880 --> 02:58:50.320]  thank you for listening to gcn be sure to visit gcnlive.com today
[02:58:50.320 --> 02:58:53.520]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[02:58:53.520 --> 02:58:57.600]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[02:58:57.600 --> 02:59:00.080]  double or triple your electric bill number two
[02:59:00.080 --> 02:59:03.920]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[02:59:03.920 --> 02:59:07.920]  allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[02:59:07.920 --> 02:59:11.440]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three
[02:59:11.440 --> 02:59:15.040]  in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[02:59:15.040 --> 02:59:18.960]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[02:59:18.960 --> 02:59:22.480]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[02:59:22.480 --> 02:59:25.600]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather-related
[02:59:25.600 --> 02:59:28.720]  onages number five a solar power generator provides
[02:59:28.720 --> 02:59:32.160]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the
[02:59:32.160 --> 02:59:35.360]  solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my old

[03:00:21.600 --> 03:00:26.640]  of course some other interesting guests on earlier in the transmission like
[03:00:26.640 --> 03:00:30.720]  ted nujah today last segment with bob chatman taking phone calls
[03:00:30.720 --> 03:00:34.560]  jamie in ohio you're on the air go ahead quick question jamie
[03:00:34.560 --> 03:00:38.640]  hey buddy for one i've got to say liberty or death my friend and i you are
[03:00:38.640 --> 03:00:43.200]  a true patriot and i appreciate you 100 percent well i appreciate you
[03:00:43.200 --> 03:00:47.600]  my my thing is is um you know actually what we're talking about with all this
[03:00:47.600 --> 03:00:51.200]  is going on the borders and all that you know this is a strategic
[03:00:51.200 --> 03:00:56.320]  plan making no mistake about it people this is not an accident this is an
[03:00:56.320 --> 03:01:01.120]  overthrow this is to merge mexico with canada and the us
[03:01:01.120 --> 03:01:04.480]  just like they set up back in the bush administration
[03:01:04.480 --> 03:01:08.800]  you know and this is just a prelude of that if you look at it logically
[03:01:08.800 --> 03:01:12.800]  that's what's going on right now they're they're holding back the people of
[03:01:12.800 --> 03:01:16.160]  arizona the great people trying to save themselves out there
[03:01:16.160 --> 03:01:20.160]  holding them back not allowing them to protect themselves and putting a hole
[03:01:20.160 --> 03:01:24.160]  in their net there you know in our border you put the strategic hole in there
[03:01:24.160 --> 03:01:27.680]  to let them come in because that is the plan of this
[03:01:27.680 --> 03:01:31.360]  administration and also with what's going to go on with
[03:01:31.360 --> 03:01:35.040]  the national ID card they're going to end up instituting that under immigration
[03:01:35.040 --> 03:01:38.160]  laws trust me no they've said that i mean we already have it as the national
[03:01:38.160 --> 03:01:41.920]  ID card you're just going to have to have it to have a job and the illegals
[03:01:41.920 --> 03:01:44.960]  are all just going to be legalized i mean that's the planet does fix the
[03:01:44.960 --> 03:01:48.960]  problem because no one is illegal and then they come in they all get welfare
[03:01:48.960 --> 03:01:51.760]  and the country goes bankrupt which is the strategic
[03:01:51.760 --> 03:01:57.600]  banking plan bob Chapman oh i think you're both absolutely correct
[03:01:57.600 --> 03:02:05.120]  and uh i see that they have a fund uh to help arizona uh
[03:02:05.120 --> 03:02:09.040]  finance the uh challenge from the federal government
[03:02:09.040 --> 03:02:13.360]  on the legislative action that they took and raised a half a million dollars in
[03:02:13.360 --> 03:02:17.680]  one day that's right and i just put in my publication for
[03:02:17.680 --> 03:02:22.160]  tomorrow if you can help them uh because you know they're
[03:02:22.160 --> 03:02:26.480]  standing in there for all americans ninety percent of americans
[03:02:26.480 --> 03:02:31.280]  are against what's going on uh immigration illegal immigration wise in
[03:02:31.280 --> 03:02:34.240]  washington and uh everybody should give them their
[03:02:34.240 --> 03:02:38.240]  help and it's on the internet i can't remember uh what the you know it's all
[03:02:38.240 --> 03:02:40.800]  over the news the ap's reporting on it as well
[03:02:40.800 --> 03:02:44.400]  uh i appreciate your call great points uh jamie
[03:02:44.400 --> 03:02:47.200]  last caller for bob i'll get to why it and mariah before the show ends that they
[03:02:47.200 --> 03:02:50.960]  can hold but uh let's go to uh mark and pencil vane here on the air with bob
[03:02:50.960 --> 03:02:55.360]  Chapman thank you thank you i like to uh in
[03:02:55.360 --> 03:02:59.280]  response to yes last week what people are going to do for the fourth
[03:02:59.280 --> 03:03:02.880]  i cracked the books and i watched the video about john adams
[03:03:02.880 --> 03:03:06.800]  i went to monicello okay jefferson was a genius
[03:03:06.800 --> 03:03:10.320]  the deal about them if they take over the money it's more powerful than
[03:03:10.320 --> 03:03:15.200]  standing armies uh i'm not long ago i recently met
[03:03:15.200 --> 03:03:18.240]  a man who works at the mint i don't know if
[03:03:18.240 --> 03:03:22.160]  bob jeffman is aware of this but our mint our mints
[03:03:22.160 --> 03:03:26.320]  actually make more make more than just the american dollar
[03:03:26.320 --> 03:03:30.160]  they print and mint coins and dollars from
[03:03:30.160 --> 03:03:34.720]  for different countries around the world so there's all this talk about
[03:03:34.720 --> 03:03:37.680]  the budget this the budget that the amount of money they spend here and
[03:03:37.680 --> 03:03:41.680]  that's a lot of drama because for these guys for these tyrants
[03:03:41.680 --> 03:03:46.160]  they have a laden's lamp they have as much funny money as they want to
[03:03:46.160 --> 03:03:49.680]  that's a great analogy then they all and they sell us stuff that they know is
[03:03:49.680 --> 03:03:53.200]  worthless to destroy us and we have their own documents
[03:03:53.200 --> 03:03:56.800]  and that's a great point they have a laden's lamp and and it's a fraud if
[03:03:56.800 --> 03:04:00.000]  you like made off sold a hundred to something billion of fake stuff these
[03:04:00.000 --> 03:04:04.240]  guys sell thousands of trillions of fake stuff and we just bow down and say
[03:04:04.240 --> 03:04:07.920]  everything's yours bob Chapman comments on that great point
[03:04:07.920 --> 03:04:12.320]  oh i love it and uh... when i when i heard him say it it just clicked like it
[03:04:12.320 --> 03:04:15.120]  did for you but uh... there are a number of mints
[03:04:15.120 --> 03:04:18.400]  throughout the world who specialize in making currencies
[03:04:18.400 --> 03:04:21.520]  and uh... in both and coin as well as uh...
[03:04:21.520 --> 03:04:26.560]  as paper for for many other countries so it's not unusual for
[03:04:26.560 --> 03:04:32.240]  a large mint to make uh... speedy for other countries
[03:04:32.240 --> 03:04:35.280]  all right we're out of time bob i look forward to seeing you again

[03:08:14.400 --> 03:08:20.480]  great thank you 531 in the border battle but now county sheriff has been
[03:08:20.480 --> 03:08:22.880]  receiving death threats because of his support
[03:08:22.880 --> 03:08:27.440]  for the law for the immigration law sheriff paul babu's office confirms he's
[03:08:27.440 --> 03:08:31.120]  received death threats from the mexican mafia
[03:08:31.120 --> 03:08:35.920]  and from the drug cartels outside law enforcement teams
[03:08:35.920 --> 03:08:39.120]  investigated the threats and found they are credible
[03:08:39.120 --> 03:08:43.040]  despite it all babu is declined to personal security detail because he says
[03:08:43.040 --> 03:08:47.520]  the county's resources are stretched thin he says they don't change his
[03:08:47.520 --> 03:08:51.440]  support and for the law and demands for president
[03:08:51.440 --> 03:08:55.120]  obama to secure the border his office says they have information that the
[03:08:55.120 --> 03:08:59.760]  gangs have placed a green light on babu's life
[03:08:59.760 --> 03:09:05.280]  babu says he's always armed and is always aware of his surroundings
[03:09:05.280 --> 03:09:11.440]  imagine this my friends here in the united states we are putting up with this
[03:09:11.440 --> 03:09:18.800]  and we have a president who on record has sued arizona
[03:09:18.800 --> 03:09:22.560]  when clearly this law is constitutional the media has lied
[03:09:22.560 --> 03:09:25.920]  another hoax just like they said ran paul was against the civil rights act
[03:09:25.920 --> 03:09:30.240]  never said that he was on the satellite going excuse me
[03:09:30.240 --> 03:09:34.640]  hold on i can't hear you yes no i'm not forgetting rid of it
[03:09:34.640 --> 03:09:38.800]  and they said oh he said yes total manipulation
[03:09:38.800 --> 03:09:42.160]  just like when somebody calls this can you hear me yes
[03:09:42.160 --> 03:09:46.640]  and it's the same thing i've read the law on air i've read the subsections
[03:09:46.640 --> 03:09:52.560]  all it says all its states
[03:09:53.840 --> 03:09:56.320]  on record
[03:09:57.600 --> 03:10:01.120]  is that if they pull an illegal alien over for something else and they're
[03:10:01.120 --> 03:10:04.400]  illegal alien they'll be arrested
[03:10:04.400 --> 03:10:08.640]  it's incredible and it is an act of treason by the federal government but
[03:10:08.640 --> 03:10:12.400]  the federal government is controlled by offshore corporations they want a
[03:10:12.400 --> 03:10:15.760]  north american union they want to get rid of our borders and our laws
[03:10:15.760 --> 03:10:19.680]  and our liberties our freedoms this is what's happening
[03:10:19.680 --> 03:10:23.360]  uh the sheriff was scheduled to call in right about now but we always have
[03:10:23.360 --> 03:10:28.000]  times on issues arizona doesn't even follow the time zone system and
[03:10:28.720 --> 03:10:32.880]  always in a security meeting we we just found out well good because i didn't
[03:10:32.880 --> 03:10:35.520]  know that i didn't know that was the reason
[03:10:35.520 --> 03:10:40.400]  i'm glad you guys told me about it so uh as soon as we uh figure it out we'll
[03:10:40.400 --> 03:10:43.200]  get him on but right now let's go ahead and talk to
[03:10:43.200 --> 03:10:47.200]  Wyatt in Louisiana Wyatt you're on the air
[03:10:47.760 --> 03:10:52.160]  hello yes Wyatt you're on the air welcome yes i have a question
[03:10:52.160 --> 03:10:58.240]  what's the best way to overall resist the new world order
[03:10:58.240 --> 03:11:02.560]  the overall best way to resist the new world order is to always be
[03:11:02.560 --> 03:11:06.960]  conscious of the fact that human history is about a struggle against tyranny
[03:11:06.960 --> 03:11:10.880]  and oppressors and the corrupt and that we need to be informed
[03:11:10.880 --> 03:11:14.080]  like the bible says the people perish for lack of knowledge we need to be
[03:11:14.080 --> 03:11:17.920]  informed and involved and we need to work with
[03:11:17.920 --> 03:11:21.600]  and form alliances with uh people that want liberty and freedom and we need to
[03:11:21.600 --> 03:11:25.600]  promote the bill of rights and constitution why did i appreciate
[03:11:25.600 --> 03:11:29.120]  your call i mean it's a lifestyle of liberty it's a lifestyle
[03:11:29.120 --> 03:11:32.400]  of freedom and we've gone through thousands of years of history
[03:11:32.400 --> 03:11:35.280]  experiencing different forms of governments and our founders created
[03:11:35.280 --> 03:11:38.960]  the best system in world history and that's why the globalists and others
[03:11:38.960 --> 03:11:41.600]  want to get rid of it because they want to create the
[03:11:41.600 --> 03:11:46.880]  world in their image not in an image of liberty and freedom
[03:11:46.880 --> 03:11:52.400]  well my friends uh for the last few days we've talked about the news headlines
[03:11:52.400 --> 03:11:57.520]  coming out of arizona mexican drug cartel since death threats to arizona
[03:11:57.520 --> 03:12:02.320]  county sheriff and he uh does uh now have time to join us we appreciate him
[03:12:02.320 --> 03:12:09.040]  coming on a sheriff paul babu um penal county arizona who has been issued
[03:12:09.040 --> 03:12:12.320]  death threats there's a i guess a hit out foreign we should take the mexican
[03:12:12.320 --> 03:12:16.960]  mafia and others serious at their word they've killed thousands of police
[03:12:16.960 --> 03:12:22.000]  uh in military uh in um mexico and he is right down there on the border
[03:12:22.000 --> 03:12:25.360]  upwards of 80 miles now off limits to citizens
[03:12:25.360 --> 03:12:28.800]  and he's been begging for aid from the federal government the federal government
[03:12:28.800 --> 03:12:32.320]  has responded by trying to block the state from even being able to ask an
[03:12:32.320 --> 03:12:35.360]  illegal alien if they're an illegal alien when they pull them over for drunk
[03:12:35.360 --> 03:12:38.960]  driving so this is treason in my opinion sheriff thanks for coming on
[03:12:38.960 --> 03:12:43.040]  alex thanks for having me on i appreciate it i know you've got a lot going on
[03:12:43.040 --> 03:12:46.240]  and i just had a security meeting uh let's talk about
[03:12:46.240 --> 03:12:50.000]  the uh the death threats against you
[03:12:50.000 --> 03:12:53.280]  and the serious escalation and let's talk about the situation
[03:12:53.280 --> 03:12:56.640]  uh that that uh is happening there on the ground in arizona
[03:12:56.640 --> 03:13:01.600]  well particular to the threats there's we get a lot of fan mail some of it not
[03:13:01.600 --> 03:13:06.960]  so pleasant from our own citizens some who disagree and make threats and
[03:13:06.960 --> 03:13:11.920]  aggressive statements that's one thing and some people could get mad at an
[03:13:11.920 --> 03:13:15.680]  elected official for raising their taxes or changing an ordinance
[03:13:15.680 --> 03:13:20.240]  but entirely different when you have foreign born criminals
[03:13:20.240 --> 03:13:25.200]  mexican mafia drug cartel members that try to bring their trash here to
[03:13:25.200 --> 03:13:28.320]  america the same stuff that goes on down in
[03:13:28.320 --> 03:13:33.360]  in mexico literally a narco terrorist state where they kill in broad daylight
[03:13:33.360 --> 03:13:37.920]  police chiefs and then take out their family and set it up as an example you
[03:13:37.920 --> 03:13:40.720]  mess with us this is what's going to happen to you
[03:13:40.720 --> 03:13:44.080]  and uh only three weeks ago they assassinated what would have been the
[03:13:44.080 --> 03:13:49.520]  elected governor of a state down there crazy and you're not
[03:13:49.520 --> 03:13:52.720]  joking around about this i live in texas and i remember
[03:13:52.720 --> 03:13:56.240]  citizens being kidnapped on our side of the border i've had sheriffs on where
[03:13:56.240 --> 03:14:01.280]  three to six miles in different cases mexican uh military will come across
[03:14:01.280 --> 03:14:05.200]  if they've caught on a major highway a drug shipment the mexican troops come
[03:14:05.200 --> 03:14:08.800]  across surround uh you know two lone policemen or
[03:14:08.800 --> 03:14:12.880]  sheriff's deputies with machine guns and rob them i mean that was going on four
[03:14:12.880 --> 03:14:14.960]  five years ago i was interviewing these people
[03:14:14.960 --> 03:14:18.720]  and it would never make the national news or even the regional news
[03:14:18.720 --> 03:14:23.040]  so there's been a cover-up of this and and and now things are deteriorating
[03:14:23.040 --> 03:14:27.120]  i mean i've had you know scholars on a university professor state department
[03:14:27.120 --> 03:14:31.360]  people who say that mexico is a failed state uh is in the
[03:14:31.360 --> 03:14:35.360]  midst of total collapse you're down there with death threats and hits out on
[03:14:35.360 --> 03:14:40.080]  you the feds are putting up signs denying the uh
[03:14:40.080 --> 03:14:43.120]  large areas to citizens saying don't go in these areas
[03:14:43.120 --> 03:14:46.800]  can you serve breakdown where you are geographically for folks that just
[03:14:46.800 --> 03:14:50.960]  joined us and describe what you face on a day-to-day basis
[03:14:50.960 --> 03:14:55.040]  we're about 80 miles north of the mexican us border
[03:14:55.040 --> 03:15:00.480]  and we're not obviously a border county yet what we're experiencing here on a
[03:15:00.480 --> 03:15:05.120]  daily basis is approximately 2 000 plus illegals that come through our
[03:15:05.120 --> 03:15:07.680]  county you're talking the border patrol who
[03:15:07.680 --> 03:15:11.120]  apprehended 200 and approximately 50 000
[03:15:11.120 --> 03:15:14.160]  illegals last year which most of them they just
[03:15:14.160 --> 03:15:17.280]  do catch and release and send them back with no punishment
[03:15:17.280 --> 03:15:22.080]  shower meal and to the border ready to try the next day
[03:15:22.080 --> 03:15:28.880]  but that's only one of 2.6 that they say get actually get in here so they're
[03:15:28.880 --> 03:15:32.480]  talking 600 000 that come in here other people
[03:15:32.480 --> 03:15:35.600]  have it estimated more at like a million a year
[03:15:35.600 --> 03:15:39.040]  just in arizona that's why we're screaming bloody murder
[03:15:39.040 --> 03:15:44.240]  saying that mr president obama do your job secure the border and here he's in
[03:15:44.240 --> 03:15:48.480]  washington high-fiving with calderon in front of congress and
[03:15:48.480 --> 03:15:52.480]  half of these all these democrats stand up give him a standing ovation
[03:15:52.480 --> 03:15:55.120]  in our country as they're kicking us in the chops
[03:15:55.120 --> 03:15:58.960]  undermining the rule of law the president should send 3 000
[03:15:58.960 --> 03:16:02.960]  soldiers to our borders to cure the border and meanwhile he sends a team of
[03:16:02.960 --> 03:16:07.280]  lawyers with the aclu to take us to drag us into court
[03:16:07.280 --> 03:16:12.480]  and this is outrageous why because in my county 80 miles north of the border
[03:16:12.480 --> 03:16:16.160]  in the heart of arizona we have paramilitary squads
[03:16:16.160 --> 03:16:19.760]  with automatic weapons that are escorting these drugs
[03:16:19.760 --> 03:16:23.280]  up here and they're bringing this violence into arizona
[03:16:23.280 --> 03:16:28.160]  we just had a gunfight out there with a competing cartel and two of these
[03:16:28.160 --> 03:16:32.400]  smugglers were killed and they call us for help
[03:16:32.400 --> 03:16:36.240]  and they knew exactly where our deputy three weeks before
[03:16:36.240 --> 03:16:42.240]  was ambushed by six of these smugglers and triangulated him and put him in a
[03:16:42.240 --> 03:16:48.320]  in a kill zone and try to kill him and and and our deputy was shot
[03:16:48.320 --> 03:16:53.600]  so here that what we have the reaction is just as you mentioned they put a
[03:16:53.600 --> 03:16:58.560]  billboard-sized signs that say danger warning stay out
[03:16:58.560 --> 03:17:03.920]  drug and human smuggling narcos all this different language on these boards
[03:17:03.920 --> 03:17:07.600]  and that's their answer is to throw up their hands and defeat
[03:17:07.600 --> 03:17:11.120]  saying we can't secure the border and this is simply outrageous
[03:17:11.120 --> 03:17:15.120]  sheriff roughly what percentage because i've seen as much as a third
[03:17:15.120 --> 03:17:19.440]  on national news being quoted but roughly what percentage of the great
[03:17:19.440 --> 03:17:23.120]  state of arizona bordering mexico is now being denied
[03:17:23.120 --> 03:17:27.120]  two law abiding citizens and losing its property values
[03:17:27.120 --> 03:17:30.560]  because the reports i've seen is that this is going on past Tucson
[03:17:30.560 --> 03:17:34.720]  80 plus miles in it is that we have there's approximately
[03:17:34.720 --> 03:17:37.920]  2 000 miles of the border from california to texas
[03:17:37.920 --> 03:17:44.000]  we have 376 of those miles in arizona there's portions of directly on the
[03:17:44.000 --> 03:17:48.240]  border that are off limits but then you have areas and it's hard to put
[03:17:48.240 --> 03:17:54.720]  an actual how many miles or acres are under control
[03:17:54.720 --> 03:17:58.000]  but i can tell you this they have unfettered access
[03:17:58.000 --> 03:18:02.480]  and that's so a third is basically a third is basically wall wall west
[03:18:02.480 --> 03:18:07.600]  and it's denying safety and security to around a third of the state
[03:18:07.600 --> 03:18:11.040]  we live in a sense uh in certain parts of
[03:18:11.040 --> 03:18:14.720]  arizona in lawlessness where these people come in
[03:18:14.720 --> 03:18:18.880]  and think that they own this area and that's uh and then the crimes that are
[03:18:18.880 --> 03:18:22.400]  committed not just against our citizens which we've got stopped
[03:18:22.400 --> 03:18:26.240]  but what about where's the outrage from all these human rights advocates
[03:18:26.240 --> 03:18:30.560]  for these people that are being brought here who do want a better life
[03:18:30.560 --> 03:18:34.800]  although it's illegal that we become the kidnapped capital
[03:18:34.800 --> 03:18:38.720]  of america last year second in the world only to Mexico City
[03:18:38.720 --> 03:18:42.480]  you know and the president says this lie
[03:18:42.480 --> 03:18:46.400]  that somehow our border is secured more than it's ever been
[03:18:46.400 --> 03:18:50.400]  this is this is craziness did you see congressman stark say the border is
[03:18:50.400 --> 03:18:56.400]  quite secure yeah these people are delirious you know
[03:18:56.400 --> 03:19:00.080]  not even knowing what we're facing what we're dealing with
[03:19:00.080 --> 03:19:05.600]  and you know here and i served in iraq and the army national guard
[03:19:05.600 --> 03:19:08.800]  still in today i don't speak for the military but i can tell you
[03:19:08.800 --> 03:19:15.520]  we've been there nine years now we spent 750 plus billion dollars with a b
[03:19:15.520 --> 03:19:18.800]  over 4 000 of our american heroes have been killed there
[03:19:18.800 --> 03:19:22.640]  and we can fight wars and liberate countries stabilize them
[03:19:22.640 --> 03:19:26.880]  all in a sake of democracy and to keep the enemies away i get all that
[03:19:26.880 --> 03:19:30.480]  but we we can't even secure our international border
[03:19:30.480 --> 03:19:33.680]  when we have hundreds of thousands of people that enter our country but you
[03:19:33.680 --> 03:19:36.800]  don't even know who they are we don't have a country if we don't have a border
[03:19:36.800 --> 03:19:40.000]  and mexico's got some of the most draconian laws
[03:19:40.000 --> 03:19:43.680]  for illegals and we basically have none stay there sir we've got to go to break
[03:19:43.680 --> 03:19:46.960]  i want to come back and talk about the that the hit that's out on you and

[03:24:06.400 --> 03:24:11.200]  sheriff paul babu of penall county arizona sheriff very valiant and
[03:24:11.200 --> 03:24:14.240]  a lot of courage to speak up against what's happening
[03:24:14.240 --> 03:24:17.360]  in this nation he's got to go to a key meeting with other sheriffs because the
[03:24:17.360 --> 03:24:21.600]  security situation is just collapsing down there as they beg for help and it's
[03:24:21.600 --> 03:24:24.640]  not coming now this is just amazing but
[03:24:24.640 --> 03:24:27.920]  specifically sir i want to talk about how we help you the websites
[03:24:27.920 --> 03:24:32.160]  of course sheriff paul dot com we'll talk about the key intel
[03:24:32.160 --> 03:24:35.920]  you've got up there on the site but specifically i've got the definition
[03:24:35.920 --> 03:24:39.200]  here and in tough times and serious times you know needs
[03:24:39.200 --> 03:24:43.760]  tough realities of high treason and it's participating in a war against one's
[03:24:43.760 --> 03:24:46.800]  country attempting to overthrow its government spying on its
[03:24:46.800 --> 03:24:50.720]  military's diplomats or secret service for a hostile foreign power
[03:24:50.720 --> 03:24:54.960]  and i'm sorry i don't know what else a federal lawsuit that's unconstitutional
[03:24:54.960 --> 03:24:59.360]  against arizona and a refusal what he told senator
[03:24:59.360 --> 03:25:03.040]  kyle in that meeting where he said i want it to be a crisis so we can pass
[03:25:03.040 --> 03:25:06.080]  immigration reform if that isn't high treason
[03:25:06.080 --> 03:25:09.680]  i don't know what is sir is this not treason
[03:25:09.680 --> 03:25:14.800]  this is their plan uh it's it borderlines that i'm not going to
[03:25:14.800 --> 03:25:19.040]  outright call it that you know he's still i'm still an officer in the army
[03:25:19.040 --> 03:25:24.400]  and uh as a as a sheriff i'm hoping that we have a correction here this year
[03:25:24.400 --> 03:25:27.440]  because the path we're going down in america is
[03:25:27.440 --> 03:25:31.200]  is not the america that i fought for and i believe in
[03:25:31.200 --> 03:25:36.480]  uh we're turning into a we're running down sprinting down the path to socialism
[03:25:36.480 --> 03:25:41.520]  and it's it's extremely troubling what's even more concerning is the president
[03:25:41.520 --> 03:25:45.200]  and his men have attacked us undermine the rule of law
[03:25:45.200 --> 03:25:49.440]  the president has deliberately this is a man who's supposed to be a constitutional
[03:25:49.440 --> 03:25:53.360]  lawyer he's very diabolical in his planning and plotting
[03:25:53.360 --> 03:25:57.600]  makes very careful statements to undermine police officers
[03:25:57.600 --> 03:26:01.600]  a pillar of justice in our society he's done it in
[03:26:01.600 --> 03:26:05.280]  cambridge when that sergeant arrested his black friend professor
[03:26:05.280 --> 03:26:09.280]  and said the cambridge police acted stupidly this isn't the first time that
[03:26:09.280 --> 03:26:14.880]  black men run in fear of the police and and then he and then he qualifies it
[03:26:14.880 --> 03:26:19.360]  let me be clear i don't have all the facts in this i haven't read the report
[03:26:19.360 --> 03:26:24.320]  but he but he slams and undermines law enforcement and plants in people's heads
[03:26:24.320 --> 03:26:28.080]  that that were the thugs that were the enemy of our citizen
[03:26:28.080 --> 03:26:31.840]  this is this is outrageous and i shall not forgive this president
[03:26:31.840 --> 03:26:35.760]  for doing this against our law enforcement we're we have a tough job out
[03:26:35.760 --> 03:26:39.360]  here in arizona and he made it that much more difficult
[03:26:39.360 --> 03:26:43.520]  when he he put an image of people in their heads of a
[03:26:43.520 --> 03:26:48.480]  hispanic male walking with his son or daughter hand in hand down main street
[03:26:48.480 --> 03:26:51.840]  with an ice cream cone the most innocent picture you could paint in
[03:26:51.840 --> 03:26:56.080]  people's minds and then in comes the police officer demanding
[03:26:56.080 --> 03:27:00.640]  papers from that hispanic father it's simply outrageous that the president
[03:27:00.640 --> 03:27:03.120]  would do that because that would never happen
[03:27:03.120 --> 03:27:07.680]  we're better than that and and we are the protectors of our constitution
[03:27:07.680 --> 03:27:10.960]  we honor the fourth amendment that protects and safeguards
[03:27:10.960 --> 03:27:15.920]  against unlawful search and seizure in america and and how dare he do that to
[03:27:15.920 --> 03:27:21.120]  our law enforcement well sheriff this is a hoax i mean i've read the bill on air
[03:27:21.120 --> 03:27:24.960]  it says if you pull somebody over who's weaving or you go to a domestic dispute
[03:27:24.960 --> 03:27:28.720]  or you go to an arm robbery event and the and and you check the id
[03:27:28.720 --> 03:27:32.160]  and it's illegal alien you arrest them because they're illegal it's totally
[03:27:32.160 --> 03:27:35.200]  constitutional it's a hoax to say they're gonna have
[03:27:35.200 --> 03:27:38.560]  nazi checkpoints grabbing people who have brown skin
[03:27:38.560 --> 03:27:41.600]  i mean this is asinine and they know it's a hoax
[03:27:41.600 --> 03:27:46.080]  you know what i'd like the president to ride with one of my deputies one night
[03:27:46.080 --> 03:27:50.320]  out here in western panel county where we have two or three pursuits a night
[03:27:50.320 --> 03:27:54.160]  that risk the life of my deputies and our citizens when these
[03:27:54.160 --> 03:27:58.320]  illegals and smugglers try to outrun the police and try to intentionally cause
[03:27:58.320 --> 03:28:02.080]  traffic wrecks or run red lights and and see
[03:28:02.080 --> 03:28:06.000]  see how he likes it what if we took the half a million a million illegals that
[03:28:06.000 --> 03:28:09.600]  come in here every year and sent them to chicago where he's from
[03:28:09.600 --> 03:28:14.080]  what do you think they would do well that's the problem is there are a lot
[03:28:14.080 --> 03:28:17.440]  of great people in mexico but mexico is collapsing and a lot of these people
[03:28:17.440 --> 03:28:21.440]  are fleeing justice there and we saw the railway
[03:28:21.440 --> 03:28:24.800]  serial killer he'd been in custody more than 10 times
[03:28:24.800 --> 03:28:28.960]  and they always released him i mean the joker i've talked to austin police
[03:28:28.960 --> 03:28:32.800]  we've also seen it in the news where a sanctuary city they admit they drunk
[03:28:32.800 --> 03:28:36.320]  driving illegals illegals with no insurance anything they're just left
[03:28:36.320 --> 03:28:39.760]  alone but as a citizen the book is thrown at me this is
[03:28:39.760 --> 03:28:43.520]  discrimination it sure is well i was a channeler police
[03:28:43.520 --> 03:28:46.640]  officer before and their sanctuary city is even out here in
[03:28:46.640 --> 03:28:50.880]  arizona and that's why this law is good because now it forces
[03:28:50.880 --> 03:28:54.720]  everybody to enforce the law and this is a class one
[03:28:54.720 --> 03:28:58.400]  misdemeanor for trespassing it's not the immigration law
[03:28:58.400 --> 03:29:02.160]  so we take him into custody and guess what we're going to be turning them over
[03:29:02.160 --> 03:29:06.480]  to ice afterwards it's not an option so the problem becomes and this is going
[03:29:06.480 --> 03:29:10.400]  to be a flashpoint alex and most people aren't looking at this
[03:29:10.400 --> 03:29:16.800]  but when the 29th comes and we arrest all these people and we continue to
[03:29:16.800 --> 03:29:19.920]  they're not telling us whether they're going to take all these people or not
[03:29:19.920 --> 03:29:22.960]  well they better because we're going to bring them to their facility if they
[03:29:22.960 --> 03:29:26.320]  don't pick them up i remember what are they going to do just let
[03:29:26.320 --> 03:29:29.600]  them walk away it's incredible so a big
[03:29:29.600 --> 03:29:33.840]  confrontation coming up here uh sheriff we're going to

[03:34:16.960 --> 03:34:21.040]  i just can't believe this is so brazen and our country
[03:34:21.040 --> 03:34:28.480]  has fallen so far that this is going on it's craziness what's happening in america
[03:34:28.480 --> 03:34:32.320]  if the people don't wise up this violence
[03:34:32.320 --> 03:34:38.000]  will continue not only to spill over the threat in a post-911 world
[03:34:38.000 --> 03:34:44.480]  when we have had literally hundreds of individuals from countries of interest
[03:34:44.480 --> 03:34:49.440]  these aren't like ecuador and mexico we're talking
[03:34:49.440 --> 03:34:53.520]  about people from nation states that are far
[03:34:53.520 --> 03:34:57.360]  or would love to destroy the united states countries like syria
[03:34:57.360 --> 03:35:03.760]  iran china from all over the world are coming here through the spores border
[03:35:03.760 --> 03:35:06.720]  and guess what they're just not staying here they're going other points
[03:35:06.720 --> 03:35:10.240]  throughout america this is a national security
[03:35:10.240 --> 03:35:14.560]  threat an issue why was homeland security created
[03:35:14.560 --> 03:35:18.800]  and and and how can we say the border is secured when we say we're only capturing
[03:35:18.800 --> 03:35:24.240]  one out of every 2.6 this is ridiculous that this is going on
[03:35:24.240 --> 03:35:28.720]  and that and that the president is looking at this purely from a political
[03:35:28.720 --> 03:35:31.680]  perspective and not a national security issue
[03:35:31.680 --> 03:35:36.160]  and not a public safety issue sheriff babu what are you going to meet with these
[03:35:36.160 --> 03:35:38.960]  sheriffs i mean unless it's a security issue but just
[03:35:38.960 --> 03:35:42.560]  in general why are you going to meet with other sheriffs right now
[03:35:42.560 --> 03:35:46.160]  well i've been talking and i'm going to get on the phone first with
[03:35:46.160 --> 03:35:50.080]  sheriff larry beaver of coche's county who's right on the border and i
[03:35:50.080 --> 03:35:54.960]  flew down there uh just two days ago uh to look at the situation i
[03:35:54.960 --> 03:35:58.640]  monitored to serve as the president of the sheriff's association here
[03:35:58.640 --> 03:36:02.880]  uh a lot of us are seeing our role and there's some sheriffs who don't agree
[03:36:02.880 --> 03:36:06.800]  with us to be honest with you this the whole fact that this 1070
[03:36:06.800 --> 03:36:11.040]  and you know what it's not going to be the solution because it's like a hamster
[03:36:11.040 --> 03:36:14.400]  on a wheel it doesn't stop we're chasing our tail
[03:36:14.400 --> 03:36:17.920]  until we secure that border we can't we can hire
[03:36:17.920 --> 03:36:22.880]  5 000 more cops and border patrol agents but you can't deal with a million
[03:36:22.880 --> 03:36:26.640]  people coming in when the president gives them no penalty
[03:36:26.640 --> 03:36:31.120]  all that's being done is dr do it just stands for voluntary return
[03:36:31.120 --> 03:36:35.040]  without punishment let me stop you if you shower and a meal
[03:36:35.040 --> 03:36:38.320]  and they bring them back to the border ready to try again incredible the
[03:36:38.320 --> 03:36:40.560]  limited time we've got i want to run through several other issues you're
[03:36:40.560 --> 03:36:43.040]  very busy man but it's been out for three days
[03:36:43.040 --> 03:36:47.600]  have you seen the tv news reports out of uh suburb of denver
[03:36:47.600 --> 03:36:50.560]  where the police charged an 82 year old veteran
[03:36:50.560 --> 03:36:54.160]  where illegal aliens were on his property robbing his his
[03:36:54.160 --> 03:36:58.160]  trailer they tried to run over him and he shot one they pled guilty
[03:36:58.160 --> 03:37:02.240]  to stealing his trailer uh and then they released the illegals and they're
[03:37:02.240 --> 03:37:08.080]  charging him with murder not just manslaughter i mean this is insane
[03:37:08.080 --> 03:37:12.800]  i haven't seen that and it isn't insanity and this is where
[03:37:12.800 --> 03:37:16.560]  patriots americans we have to stand up for not only our
[03:37:16.560 --> 03:37:20.960]  rights and our liberties uh that people have always said the threat comes
[03:37:20.960 --> 03:37:25.440]  from within and because this is uh very troubling
[03:37:25.440 --> 03:37:29.440]  and i see this sense of anger and outrage and we're going to keep the
[03:37:29.440 --> 03:37:32.640]  focus here to demand that this problem get
[03:37:32.640 --> 03:37:36.720]  changed and then with our republic in democratic
[03:37:36.720 --> 03:37:41.120]  principles throw these bombs the hell out of office
[03:37:41.120 --> 03:37:44.640]  let's go back to the kidnapping issue because i remember three years ago the
[03:37:44.640 --> 03:37:48.640]  state department listed mexico as the second most dangerous
[03:37:48.640 --> 03:37:52.240]  country for crime in the world number one for kidnapping
[03:37:52.240 --> 03:37:56.320]  and put a travel advisory out parents are still sitting there
[03:37:56.320 --> 03:38:00.480]  high school graduate kids down to mexico even the resort towns are getting
[03:38:00.480 --> 03:38:03.520]  hellishly dangerous and so for people that do know about
[03:38:03.520 --> 03:38:07.440]  how dangerous mexico is i don't think they realize that south texas
[03:38:07.440 --> 03:38:11.360]  and areas of arizona are as dangerous statistically can you speak to the
[03:38:11.360 --> 03:38:17.600]  kidnapping yeah the kidnapping is largely targeted
[03:38:17.600 --> 03:38:21.360]  to be legal and this is where these people which
[03:38:21.360 --> 03:38:25.760]  so uh ironic is all these same people that like jack
[03:38:25.760 --> 03:38:28.640]  harris a police chief of phoenix and all these other
[03:38:28.640 --> 03:38:32.240]  people who have loved to preside over sanctuary cities
[03:38:32.240 --> 03:38:36.800]  uh they're saying that well if we we enforce the law that there's going to
[03:38:36.800 --> 03:38:40.400]  be suppressed reporting by these illegal and that's
[03:38:40.400 --> 03:38:44.240]  absolutely false not only because we're the kidnapped capital because none of
[03:38:44.240 --> 03:38:48.240]  their policies in the past have worked but the fact that their culture they
[03:38:48.240 --> 03:38:52.080]  come from they don't call the police they just if they
[03:38:52.080 --> 03:38:55.680]  handle things on their own because the police are corrupt down there well
[03:38:55.680 --> 03:38:59.520]  that's common sense that's common sense if if they let the
[03:38:59.520 --> 03:39:03.360]  murderers and rapists and kidnappers go these illegal
[03:39:03.360 --> 03:39:07.280]  communities are scared to death and of course i mean that's common sense that
[03:39:07.280 --> 03:39:11.040]  this causes crime to increase right here
[03:39:11.040 --> 03:39:14.880]  absolutely and this is where uh the president is
[03:39:14.880 --> 03:39:19.680]  is really looking at uh undocumented aliens as undocumented
[03:39:19.680 --> 03:39:24.800]  democrats and it's a it's a shame uh not only for america
[03:39:24.800 --> 03:39:28.560]  we are at the tip of the spear here in arizona of all the illegals that come
[03:39:28.560 --> 03:39:32.960]  into america over half of them come through our state
[03:39:32.960 --> 03:39:37.600]  and uh we have said time and again uh we need help and
[03:39:37.600 --> 03:39:41.200]  it's not that i'm throwing up my hands saying we just can't do the job
[03:39:41.200 --> 03:39:46.480]  i only have 214 deputies for an area the size of the state of connecticut
[03:39:46.480 --> 03:39:50.720]  i can't stop hundreds of thousands of people who are coming in here by
[03:39:50.720 --> 03:39:54.080]  ourselves and this is where we need to deploy
[03:39:54.080 --> 03:39:58.000]  soldiers who are armed to the border and while they're deployed there
[03:39:58.000 --> 03:40:02.400]  build the double barrier fence that the president has stopped constructing
[03:40:02.400 --> 03:40:06.640]  that president clinton of all people had signed to establish so he did something
[03:40:06.640 --> 03:40:10.320]  very good there and then we have to end catch and release
[03:40:10.320 --> 03:40:13.840]  they have to be deported there has to be a penalty and punishment
[03:40:13.840 --> 03:40:19.360]  it's the rule of law in america we've got to stand up and defend our country
[03:40:19.360 --> 03:40:23.280]  sheriff specifically you know you're an expert on this you're down there on the
[03:40:23.280 --> 03:40:26.800]  front lines of this and you're the head of the sheriff's association down there
[03:40:26.800 --> 03:40:30.240]  can you specifically tell us and people listening all over the country right
[03:40:30.240 --> 03:40:35.440]  now what they can do individually to aid arizona
[03:40:35.440 --> 03:40:41.040]  that is the front line of this criminal invasion
[03:40:41.040 --> 03:40:45.360]  his cell phone we just lost it uh so let's call him back
[03:40:45.360 --> 03:40:48.800]  um and get that final comment but the website is
[03:40:48.800 --> 03:40:53.360]  sheriff paul dot com and we will try to get him back
[03:40:53.360 --> 03:40:57.840]  online he's out driving and it either dropped or something disconnected it
[03:40:57.840 --> 03:41:00.640]  great because i want him to be able to finish that point and we're gonna let
[03:41:00.640 --> 03:41:04.240]  him go and get to a few year calls and some other news but
[03:41:04.240 --> 03:41:07.120]  you know what if you're for open borders folks you come down here to south
[03:41:07.120 --> 03:41:10.800]  texas on the border i mean it is a war zone and he was nice 10 years ago it's
[03:41:10.800 --> 03:41:14.480]  all boarded up in ghost towns and i've seen that what's happening in
[03:41:14.480 --> 03:41:18.800]  arizona and it is uh it is a real it is a real
[03:41:18.800 --> 03:41:21.840]  travesty and and if they continue to be able to
[03:41:21.840 --> 03:41:26.000]  threaten and kill police and others where does it end i mean the police are
[03:41:26.000 --> 03:41:29.840]  totally outnumbered and destroyed mexico and
[03:41:29.840 --> 03:41:34.720]  and others just become corrupt uh and get bought off
[03:41:34.720 --> 03:41:37.840]  and then that's what the drug cartels do they say either you take this money
[03:41:37.840 --> 03:41:41.120]  from us or we're gonna kill you we've had us embassy staff
[03:41:41.120 --> 03:41:45.360]  killed we've had you just a few weeks ago i mean this is
[03:41:45.360 --> 03:41:50.400]  this is insane they kill mayors they kill police chiefs they kill police they
[03:41:50.400 --> 03:41:54.080]  thousands and thousands of dead cops in mexico and now it's coming here
[03:41:54.080 --> 03:41:57.280]  and the federal government hopes they can get their amnesty before you find out
[03:41:57.280 --> 03:42:01.440]  what's going on as they merge uh this country
[03:42:01.440 --> 03:42:05.040]  right now um who knows his battery may have died
[03:42:05.040 --> 03:42:08.240]  or something as well but um the website is of
[03:42:08.240 --> 03:42:12.320]  sheriff paul dot com and he's got a lot of videos there
[03:42:12.320 --> 03:42:14.880]  uh sheriff last question because i know you're about to go into your meeting and
[03:42:14.880 --> 03:42:19.360]  your phone drop what can we do specifically to aid
[03:42:19.360 --> 03:42:23.680]  arizona which is the very front lines
[03:42:23.680 --> 03:42:28.240]  well we're talking about other actions we can take here in a sheriff's office
[03:42:28.240 --> 03:42:32.560]  and deploying more deputies out there uh to work with other
[03:42:32.560 --> 03:42:36.480]  sheriffs across america not just arizona sheriffs i'm working with
[03:42:36.480 --> 03:42:40.160]  are talking about sending dirt deputies out here to help us
[03:42:40.160 --> 03:42:45.440]  i'm looking to outfit our deputies with we all have a handgun and a shotgun and
[03:42:45.440 --> 03:42:48.960]  few rifles but i want to purchase
[03:42:48.960 --> 03:42:54.160]  automatic uh rifles a browning 226 for each of my deputies so we're not
[03:42:54.160 --> 03:42:58.320]  outgun and to go back into these areas and to reclaim
[03:42:58.320 --> 03:43:01.680]  these areas well that's another point they've got giant armored tanks for
[03:43:01.680 --> 03:43:05.440]  housewives all over the country the only place the constitution says that
[03:43:05.440 --> 03:43:09.120]  that the police and military should have that is on the border we need
[03:43:09.120 --> 03:43:12.960]  abram's tanks down there so the next time mexican troops start shooting at
[03:43:12.960 --> 03:43:16.320]  cops we need to wipe them out yeah well we need
[03:43:16.320 --> 03:43:20.160]  for people all your listeners and and good americans that
[03:43:20.160 --> 03:43:24.720]  immediately call your congressman your your office and demand
[03:43:24.720 --> 03:43:28.240]  to support for arizona and to support the rule of law
[03:43:28.240 --> 03:43:31.920]  and to tell the president to immediately deploy soldiers
[03:43:31.920 --> 03:43:37.200]  we're not going to stand for amnesty or any of this uh immigration reform
[03:43:37.200 --> 03:43:40.400]  well i mean you're outdone by mexican troops i know the county's on the
[03:43:40.400 --> 03:43:43.680]  border routinely gets shot at by mexican troops i mean
[03:43:43.680 --> 03:43:47.520]  i mean this is outrageous it is outrageous
[03:43:47.520 --> 03:43:51.040]  you know what's it gonna take you know now
[03:43:51.040 --> 03:43:55.760]  there's more people being kidnapped killed there's carjackings home invasions
[03:43:55.760 --> 03:43:59.200]  that go on out here uh in chandler where i work
[03:43:59.200 --> 03:44:02.960]  we had the chandler rapist who raped countless
[03:44:02.960 --> 03:44:08.080]  young females that were from america and this guy was a multiple deported
[03:44:08.080 --> 03:44:12.800]  illegal you know we've had illegals uh guy from makes it take other illegals
[03:44:12.800 --> 03:44:16.080]  into my county and rob them at gunpoint or rape
[03:44:16.080 --> 03:44:18.400]  that women or kill them and leave them for
[03:44:18.400 --> 03:44:21.360]  dead and here in our county you know this stuff
[03:44:21.360 --> 03:44:26.000]  is that in addition to the regular crime that goes on throughout america
[03:44:26.000 --> 03:44:29.280]  but this when you add nearly 20 of the illegals
[03:44:29.280 --> 03:44:32.960]  already have a criminal record and we can't even check
[03:44:32.960 --> 03:44:36.560]  the records that of the countries that come from well sheriff
[03:44:36.560 --> 03:44:39.760]  people need to find out more at sheriff paul dot com and i want you to briefly
[03:44:39.760 --> 03:44:42.560]  talk about what's on the site and other ways we can help you but i got
[03:44:42.560 --> 03:44:46.240]  two fast questions i've protested the movie machete
[03:44:46.240 --> 03:44:50.400]  people at part of robert rodriguez's film crew sent me the information i got
[03:44:50.400 --> 03:44:54.800]  the script it is it shows minute men and police
[03:44:54.800 --> 03:44:59.840]  uh in texas killing illegals and then the illegals killing police it glorifies
[03:44:59.840 --> 03:45:04.080]  it yeah it's it's it's like birth of a nation from a kuklux klan
[03:45:04.080 --> 03:45:09.200]  perspective oh yeah i protested it and he says he's edited those parts out now
[03:45:09.200 --> 03:45:13.600]  but but the issue is you know a film like that coming out in september
[03:45:13.600 --> 03:45:17.840]  that glorifies killing police because they're all racist and deserve to die
[03:45:17.840 --> 03:45:22.400]  i think if if this stuff doesn't get cut out it could cause some serious
[03:45:22.400 --> 03:45:25.600]  backlash i've got the script i mean it is dangerous i know
[03:45:25.600 --> 03:45:28.800]  the other thing what's happening it's it's crazy here we're talking about a
[03:45:28.800 --> 03:45:33.680]  public state the issue now the obama and his and his folks and the democrats
[03:45:33.680 --> 03:45:38.720]  here locally 1875 our county was formed i'm the first
[03:45:38.720 --> 03:45:43.120]  republican elected county official in the history of this county
[03:45:43.120 --> 03:45:46.400]  and there's no longer a sanctuary county
[03:45:46.400 --> 03:45:50.400]  we're enforcing the law these people are already i'm not up for re-election
[03:45:50.400 --> 03:45:55.440]  2012 but they're organizing against me starting to raise money
[03:45:55.440 --> 03:46:00.160]  recruiting candidates so even this early i've got to become strong
[03:46:00.160 --> 03:46:04.480]  and raise money and do all that uh in order to be prepared to fight off these
[03:46:04.480 --> 03:46:08.160]  people who want to take me out well this is a not fair people are trying
[03:46:08.160 --> 03:46:12.400]  to put a green light on me to take me out from the mexican cartel
[03:46:12.400 --> 03:46:16.480]  well absolutely and again uh this isn't a joke
[03:46:16.480 --> 03:46:20.240]  uh and and i've seen some of the liberal media making jokes about all big deal
[03:46:20.240 --> 03:46:23.360]  death threats i mean this is the mexican mafia we're talking about they've
[03:46:23.360 --> 03:46:28.000]  killed thousands of police in mexico right in broad daylight just uh
[03:46:28.000 --> 03:46:30.640]  what was that so we can have two weeks ago now
[03:46:30.640 --> 03:46:34.800]  there's a new police chief a young police chief and rocky point
[03:46:34.800 --> 03:46:39.200]  which is an american resort area that a lot of our people go to
[03:46:39.200 --> 03:46:43.600]  and they right in the busy street in the middle of an evening
[03:46:43.600 --> 03:46:47.360]  they shot riddled his whole truck him and his bodyguard
[03:46:47.360 --> 03:46:51.840]  and surprisingly the police chief lived he's got like six bullet holes in him
[03:46:51.840 --> 03:46:55.280]  but this is a message that they sent so do you want to be
[03:46:55.280 --> 03:46:59.520]  alex the police chief after that guy you know and that's what they do they
[03:46:59.520 --> 03:47:03.280]  intimidate anybody in a position of power well
[03:47:03.280 --> 03:47:07.280]  they're not bringing this trash to america because we're going to fight back
[03:47:07.280 --> 03:47:11.280]  we're not going to run from any of these threats or hide or change our
[03:47:11.280 --> 03:47:13.920]  positions that we're going to stand up for the rule of
[03:47:13.920 --> 03:47:17.680]  law and stand up to secure our border and to stop
[03:47:17.680 --> 03:47:21.200]  what is what is truly an invasion but washington
[03:47:21.200 --> 03:47:25.920]  is trying to paint you as the bad guys and i'm telling you if they end up
[03:47:25.920 --> 03:47:28.720]  killing you or somebody else it's going to be the alamo and it's going to be
[03:47:28.720 --> 03:47:33.360]  remember you know sheriff babu it's going to be remember
[03:47:33.360 --> 03:47:36.560]  all these ranchers and people that have been killed and god forbid that happens
[03:47:36.560 --> 03:47:40.240]  but if you turn into the colonel travis of 2010
[03:47:40.240 --> 03:47:46.320]  2011 i mean this is serious business and it just shows how
[03:47:46.320 --> 03:47:49.840]  how horrible things have gotten lastly what do you think of sheriff
[03:47:49.840 --> 03:47:53.280]  richard max saying not only should we take back our states
[03:47:53.280 --> 03:47:57.120]  we should take back the sheriff's departments and get patriots in there
[03:47:57.120 --> 03:48:00.800]  that understand their true constitutional power
[03:48:00.800 --> 03:48:04.800]  yeah we need we need sheriffs who stand up for the rule of law and sheriff max
[03:48:04.800 --> 03:48:08.640]  right that there's a note i was a sworn police
[03:48:08.640 --> 03:48:13.360]  officer before and i've fought and defended america liberties in the
[03:48:13.360 --> 03:48:17.360]  military but as a sheriff this is the top law man
[03:48:17.360 --> 03:48:21.200]  of that county and we have an obligation to
[03:48:21.200 --> 03:48:26.080]  not only protect our families but to stand up and and to be the representative
[03:48:26.080 --> 03:48:28.880]  of the people that's right you're elected you're not
[03:48:28.880 --> 03:48:33.040]  you're not some penny any city that's just incorporated you are elected by the
[03:48:33.040 --> 03:48:36.080]  people you you represent the people just like the
[03:48:36.080 --> 03:48:39.920]  legislature and that was the original and only police power
[03:48:39.920 --> 03:48:43.440]  in this country it's been usurped by the feds and their city
[03:48:43.440 --> 03:48:46.640]  minions that are engaged in trees in over 800 cities
[03:48:46.640 --> 03:48:50.400]  with these sanctuary cities where citizens are crap and the illegals are
[03:48:50.400 --> 03:48:54.480]  god because they're a tool to swell the welfare state
[03:48:54.480 --> 03:48:57.920]  and it's just incredible in closing sir and i'm gonna let you go
[03:48:57.920 --> 03:49:01.520]  tell us about what we'll learn at sheriff paul dot com
[03:49:01.520 --> 03:49:05.840]  you're gonna see not only all the videos and the information
[03:49:05.840 --> 03:49:09.520]  and updates about what we're facing here in arizona
[03:49:09.520 --> 03:49:12.960]  uh but we go after and hold president obama accountable
[03:49:12.960 --> 03:49:18.080]  uh i go after every time i get a chance to throw a jab at him and to show him
[03:49:18.080 --> 03:49:20.560]  for what he is and what he's doing to our country
[03:49:20.560 --> 03:49:25.600]  and undermining not just the rule of law but literally an assault upon police
[03:49:25.600 --> 03:49:28.800]  officers across america you'll see all that there
[03:49:28.800 --> 03:49:32.640]  and also find ways that people if they wanted to contribute they can do that

[03:49:39.840 --> 03:49:44.240]  anything else we can do i guess just support the defense against that federal
[03:49:44.240 --> 03:49:49.680]  trees in lawsuit yeah and also get on the phone to your congressman and demand
[03:49:49.680 --> 03:49:54.320]  that they support arizona well it's got to be heartening for you to see a bunch
[03:49:54.320 --> 03:49:57.600]  of other states lining up against the federal treason
[03:49:57.600 --> 03:50:02.400]  yes so there'll be more to follow and what's so shocking as the president our
[03:50:02.400 --> 03:50:08.400]  own government stands against us and sides with a foreign leader
[03:50:08.400 --> 03:50:11.520]  this is so cut and dry well it it is treason

[03:50:31.360 --> 03:50:35.680]  uh and uh she wanted to be a larika and quistan she went down to mexico to be a
[03:50:35.680 --> 03:50:40.160]  coyote and these men took her and raped her for days and killed her
[03:50:40.160 --> 03:50:44.080]  and uh there are people attached to former city council members who are
[03:50:44.080 --> 03:50:47.440]  coyotes who finally went to prison beating up illegal aliens
[03:50:47.440 --> 03:50:51.840]  and torturing them here in austin i mean this system is is just horrible for
