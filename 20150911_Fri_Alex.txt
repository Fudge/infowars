[00:00.000 --> 00:14.760]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.760 --> 00:27.320]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones well here we are my
[00:27.320 --> 00:35.840]  friends 14 years after the tragic events of September 11 2001 that were used to transform
[00:35.840 --> 00:41.360]  not just the United States but many other nations across the world into Orwellian police
[00:41.360 --> 00:48.760]  states that as you notice as Benjamin Franklin's warning comes true giving up security for
[00:48.760 --> 01:00.720]  supposedly safety or giving up liberty for so-called security and safety leads to absolute
[01:00.720 --> 01:06.600]  total enslavement I just had a Freudian slip there I was trying to quote him from memory
[01:06.600 --> 01:13.280]  teleprompter free that those that give up liberty for security will receive and deserve
[01:13.280 --> 01:21.360]  but neither and so I was saying those that give up security for safety are idiots because
[01:21.360 --> 01:28.400]  I see liberty as security so you don't get safety out of giving up your security the
[01:28.400 --> 01:35.560]  two things are interchangeable so my mind just change the word in midstream because
[01:35.560 --> 01:45.320]  I'm so dedicated to new radically telling the truth it goes without saying if you give
[01:45.320 --> 01:52.680]  up freedom if you give up your basic rights if you let a outside group a centralized secret
[01:52.680 --> 02:00.440]  of group control your resources in your life you will wake up very very soon being enslaved
[02:00.440 --> 02:06.240]  that's the history of the world it's absolute common sense and as the checks and balances
[02:06.240 --> 02:16.120]  go out the window it becomes more transparent than ever we have quite a lineup today here
[02:16.120 --> 02:24.800]  on the broadcast we have the barber he contacted us he's going on Fox News today he said he
[02:24.800 --> 02:32.800]  wanted to come on here first he saw us talk about it barbershop find $750 for refusing
[02:32.800 --> 02:42.440]  to cut a woman's hair it advertises as a men's barbershop and a woman came in and said you're
[02:42.440 --> 02:44.960]  going to cut my hair and they said we don't have the equipment to cut your hair the way
[02:44.960 --> 02:55.160]  you want it done go to a women's hair cutting place and Pittsburgh find them you just say
[02:55.160 --> 02:59.960]  yeah okay it's ridiculous but why are you obsessing over this story because this is
[02:59.960 --> 03:06.360]  the future they're not going to find any women's hair cutting places for not cutting men's
[03:06.360 --> 03:17.320]  hair they're going to persecute and harass any bastions of male identity or male behavior
[03:17.320 --> 03:24.560]  it is a culture war the feminist are going to talk about men being sexual objects but
[03:24.560 --> 03:29.160]  if a man does it you're going to get arrested that's already happening in some areas of
[03:29.160 --> 03:39.720]  Europe this story was out yesterday feminist claim it's sexes to compliment women feminazi
[03:39.720 --> 03:46.560]  publicly shames man for complimenting her another lawyer came by her LinkedIn this is in the
[03:46.560 --> 03:51.840]  telegraph today we reported only a few days ago and said to her you've got a stunning
[03:51.840 --> 03:59.420]  photo best profile photo I've seen she then publicly shamed him and was praised by them
[03:59.420 --> 04:06.200]  as groups for standing up to the oppression well turns out London telegraph lawyer who
[04:06.200 --> 04:13.400]  accused barrister of sexism has described men online as hot stuff and trolled around
[04:13.400 --> 04:19.080]  telling them they're hot see it's all about power to these people who aren't really that
[04:19.080 --> 04:23.960]  smart or aren't really that powerful to play the political correct game of sexism or the
[04:23.960 --> 04:31.880]  race card as a get out of jail free card and when you bow to them you only empower their
[04:31.880 --> 04:36.440]  bizarre behavior but that's coming up the second hour it is obviously the 14th anniversary

[05:26.080 --> 05:31.000]  was in cahoots with the Saudi government to allow and create this to happen never forget

[09:11.400 --> 09:19.880]  not just here but across the world the radical islamic invasion being supported by traitorous
[09:19.880 --> 09:26.320]  western governments and more and then the owner of the barbershop johnny interval there
[09:26.320 --> 09:33.080]  in pittsburgh that is a men's barbershop and a woman showed up and wanted her hair done
[09:33.080 --> 09:37.480]  the way women have it done they said lady we don't have the equipment well she got to
[09:37.480 --> 09:43.320]  have her little victory and ran off and got them fine for it so next fraternal orders
[09:43.320 --> 09:51.640]  like the masons will they have to accept women next can i go to a black fraternal club and
[09:51.640 --> 09:57.760]  demand that i be made a prince hall mason or we had a guest in here a few days ago who
[09:57.760 --> 10:06.560]  made the point can i if i have a dodge can i go into a toyota or a mercedes benz or bmw
[10:06.560 --> 10:16.080]  or saab or ferrari or lamborghini or nissan dealership and say hey i've got a dodge car
[10:16.080 --> 10:20.640]  i want you to work on it they go do you see the sign sir there's a dodge down the street
[10:20.640 --> 10:26.920]  we work on toyotas here or we work on german imports here oh why you discriminate against
[10:26.920 --> 10:31.720]  me i got a dodge well sir we can't afford all the equipment for all the cars and we have
[10:31.720 --> 10:37.240]  the mechanics for german cars i mean it has nothing to do with the pressing women and
[10:37.240 --> 10:42.560]  they know that and it's it's like men used to go join the military to earn their bones
[10:42.560 --> 10:46.880]  so daddy who was a veteran would respect them and that's why most men end up joining the
[10:46.880 --> 10:50.440]  military because daddy was in the military and his daddy was in the military or most
[10:50.440 --> 11:00.920]  guys become cops is because grandpa was a cop and every male purview every male reservation
[11:00.920 --> 11:08.680]  every male place has to be overrun and taken over in some bizarre ford foundation rockefeller
[11:08.680 --> 11:16.920]  foundation directed paramilitary operation of weird power tripping women who are now
[11:16.920 --> 11:27.280]  discovering what it's like to have six foot four 350 pound in one case man in their dressing
[11:27.280 --> 11:36.280]  rooms at their gyms and at their clubs and they're freaking out but see they're trumped
[11:36.280 --> 11:44.200]  by transgender here's one san francisco la now la times san francisco jails to house transgender
[11:44.200 --> 11:48.840]  inmates based on gender preferences well the women don't have to worry too much about a
[11:48.840 --> 11:55.520]  bunch of men who say they're women wanting to be over at the women's prison or the women's
[11:55.520 --> 12:00.920]  jail because let me tell you the transgenders are gonna want to be with the men in most
[12:00.920 --> 12:08.840]  cases but can you imagine I mean I've seen the documentaries on PBS first time I ever
[12:08.840 --> 12:15.500]  saw when I was a kid my parents let me watch PBS and not a lot more they called television
[12:15.500 --> 12:21.120]  brain rot and I saw some documentary about death row and it showed men who were allowed
[12:21.120 --> 12:25.000]  to be given hormones to be women that's where they did the social engineering test in the
[12:25.000 --> 12:31.360]  80s was on the prisons and it showed like on TV documentary men with big breasts fondling
[12:31.360 --> 12:35.960]  each other and I was like to my dad who was out of the room I go dad what is this he goes
[12:35.960 --> 12:40.880]  yeah that goes on in the prisons where men adopt the fact that they're a woman to basically
[12:40.880 --> 12:45.600]  have a place in the prison they get passed around and most of them get HIV and he goes
[12:45.600 --> 12:50.280]  and they also give their blood to get the drug money and the prisons sell them the drugs
[12:50.280 --> 12:55.120]  I kind of rolled my eyes you know as my dad that told me don't be an organ donor they'll
[12:55.120 --> 13:00.320]  kill you in the hospitals and sell your organs and I said dad that's crazy and he goes okay
[13:00.320 --> 13:04.360]  well I've rewired jaws in hospitals where they say don't sign the organ donor card to
[13:04.360 --> 13:10.200]  the other doctors he was an oral surgeon and then years later 60 minutes Dallas Texas
[13:10.200 --> 13:15.200]  Chicago Illinois killing people in the hospitals for their organs my dad said I'm not gonna
[13:15.200 --> 13:20.840]  repeat it all to you he just it's like the movie coma I said what's the movie coma and
[13:20.840 --> 13:25.680]  he goes go to the video store with your mother and rented if you want to know turns out how
[13:25.680 --> 13:31.760]  right my dad I guess he was the original conspiracy theorist in the family because he was right
[13:31.760 --> 13:38.880]  but that's all this is so you're a woman in prison and a 250 pound guy comes in and he's
[13:38.880 --> 13:49.360]  a lady and you see if they can get away with this they can't do anything like they just
[13:49.360 --> 13:58.680]  pull up an article mass murder was given the right to taxpayer funded sex change in prison
[13:58.680 --> 14:07.680]  and man death row is a party it is a party and they work the system so we've got the
[14:07.680 --> 14:13.660]  owner of the barbershop coming on and then we've got Joseph Farron we got Patrick Chuck
[14:13.660 --> 14:26.560]  Baldwin today it is the 14th anniversary of 9-11 2001 and before I get to the latest
[14:26.560 --> 14:31.400]  on 9-11 I think Leigh Ann McAdoon at a superlative job with the rest of the host last night on
[14:31.400 --> 14:39.200]  9-11 is going back over some of the more bombshell interviews we've done including a high level
[14:39.200 --> 14:45.240]  recently retired senior firefighter who talked about the bombs in the buildings and what
[14:45.240 --> 14:51.480]  really happened that day but I just want to look to what's currently happening and what's
[14:51.480 --> 14:58.240]  going to happen and how 14 years later Al Qaeda ISIS Saudi Arabian proxy armies are bigger
[14:58.240 --> 15:05.640]  and batter by a scale of I don't want to exaggerate they admit there's about 250,000 operatives
[15:05.640 --> 15:14.280]  they know they have Al Qaeda had a couple thousand before so a couple hundred thousand
[15:14.280 --> 15:20.240]  versus a couple thousand I mean it's just exponentially bigger do the math yourself we're going to
[15:20.240 --> 15:26.240]  tie that in now with the former deputy director recently stepped down of the central intelligence
[15:26.240 --> 15:32.440]  agency saying that they were basically ordered to make up false intelligence to cover up Al
[15:32.440 --> 15:39.320]  Qaeda and ISIS is spread that's on info wars.com and it dovetails with former DIA director US
[15:39.320 --> 15:45.440]  made willful decision to support ISIS in Syria so the good news is our own government our
[15:45.440 --> 15:51.200]  own CIA and Defense Department we do think I've had on blowing the whistle on 9-11 CIA
[15:51.200 --> 15:58.040]  and FBI others the deputy director of the FBI was killed on 9-11 John O'Neill he gave a
[15:58.040 --> 16:03.440]  speech two weeks before in England the telegraph covered it saying our government basically
[16:03.440 --> 16:07.440]  runs Islamic extremists they're protecting them they're going to allow them to attack
[16:07.440 --> 16:13.880]  to take our liberties he was then called in the day of 9-11 and blown up in the building
[16:13.880 --> 16:27.680]  can't make this up can't ever make up reality compared to fiction reality so much wilder
[16:27.680 --> 16:34.560]  it always is truth is stranger than fiction so we're going to be getting into all of
[16:34.560 --> 16:42.400]  that today but here's the really big news and this is what I experienced growing up in
[16:42.400 --> 16:50.480]  Dallas Texas living in Austin Texas spending a lot of summers least a month each summer
[16:50.480 --> 16:58.480]  for a lot of years with my cousins down in San Antonio so my parents could have a break
[16:58.480 --> 17:06.160]  that I'd say from the polls I've seen what I've experienced about 65 70% of Hispanic
[17:06.160 --> 17:13.240]  Americans are really upset about illegals because they know they work the system and
[17:13.240 --> 17:20.680]  work jobs but then also get welfare driving down wages and the Hispanic Americans who
[17:20.680 --> 17:25.960]  just want to be called Americans are generally pretty prideful folks don't have abortions
[17:25.960 --> 17:32.360]  don't have as many divorces don't call the police as often own guns and work as hard
[17:32.360 --> 17:39.240]  as they can to play by the rules and our military veterans and they really get upset by the
[17:39.240 --> 17:47.480]  illegals because the illegals not all of them but a portion of them are very tribal in Mexico
[17:47.480 --> 17:51.720]  Mexican towns have fights for the next town all the time this is what humans do and they
[17:51.720 --> 17:57.720]  basically fight with each other and they understand what's happening so when you hear this hoax
[17:57.720 --> 18:02.440]  that two plus two equals five or you can keep your doctor under Obamacare or it's free or
[18:02.440 --> 18:05.920]  you didn't build your business or raising the debt limit doesn't raise the debt limit
[18:05.920 --> 18:11.880]  it is a giant hoax when you hear the hoax that Republicans are going to lose the election
[18:11.880 --> 18:17.000]  because they want to have a little bit of a border and not let people have their babies
[18:17.000 --> 18:23.440]  for free well I mean now the majority Chinese women have their babies for free upwards of
[18:23.440 --> 18:30.920]  ten thousand a week pouring in it's just not fair and we're going bankrupt and people
[18:30.920 --> 18:34.400]  are playing by the rules paying all these taxes and can't make ends meet and they're
[18:34.400 --> 18:41.480]  watching Eastern Europeans Africans Chinese Mexicans Guatemalans Nicaraguans Brazilians
[18:41.480 --> 18:47.040]  you name it getting everything free and they're mad what sane person wouldn't be and here's
[18:47.040 --> 18:54.080]  a Gallup poll one of the most scientific out there two out of three Hispanics oppose immigration
[18:54.080 --> 18:59.680]  increase well that's because a lot of Hispanics have also been down to Mexico or been down
[18:59.680 --> 19:03.280]  to Central America and it's a lot of beautiful places a lot of cool stuff but let me tell
[19:03.280 --> 19:14.560]  you it's dangerous and scary at the end of the day and there's new stuff out in the British
[19:14.560 --> 19:21.760]  and German news migrants in concentration camps migrants shades of Nazi Germany's the
[19:21.760 --> 19:25.560]  BBC headline another headline in the in the telegraph I'm going to read it when we come
[19:25.560 --> 19:33.600]  back is it's like Guantanamo Bay well yeah if you've got eighty thousand a hundred thousand
[19:33.600 --> 19:40.640]  people in a sports stadium or in a train station and they're robbing and raping each other
[19:40.640 --> 19:45.880]  because that's what happens with any human group weeks pinned up you might literally
[19:45.880 --> 19:52.680]  walking into Europe and when the aid workers going to try to give them food they get attacked
[19:52.680 --> 19:58.080]  they get beat up they get robbed and so they're throwing sandwiches and water over to them
[19:58.080 --> 20:01.520]  the people screaming they want to kill them most of us already know that taking a fish
[20:01.520 --> 20:05.840]  oil supplement to boost omega-3s is a good idea but did you know that about sixty percent
[20:05.840 --> 20:10.240]  of Americans are actually deficient in omega-3s did you know that most fish oil products contain
[20:10.240 --> 20:14.840]  only about twenty five percent omega-3s and the remaining seventy five percent is undesirable
[20:14.840 --> 20:18.680]  fish fat heck did you know that more than ninety percent of fish oil supplements sold
[20:18.680 --> 20:23.720]  in the USA are not even made here if you want to boost your omega-3s using the finest American
[20:23.720 --> 20:29.800]  made fish oil check out neutral gold fish oil supplements on www.fishoil.best neutral

[24:34.840 --> 24:41.360]  being robbed aid workers trying to come in with bags of food or bags of money little
[24:41.360 --> 24:48.400]  envelopes and they're being mobbed they're being robbed they're being attacked and so
[24:48.400 --> 24:53.480]  now in Hungary and other areas Hungary has upwards of 300,000 illegals that have just
[24:53.480 --> 24:59.020]  poured in the last few months these folks show up at train stations demanding to be
[24:59.020 --> 25:06.840]  let on trains now that Germany and Austria have halted trains well Austria is halting
[25:06.840 --> 25:10.840]  trains that would go through to Germany Germany wants the people that is their communist leadership
[25:10.840 --> 25:16.960]  does they are walking across the country and so if you go into these mobs of the police
[25:16.960 --> 25:24.960]  go into these mobs they are attacked and you see people fighting for the food and so they're
[25:24.960 --> 25:31.800]  throwing them the sandwiches because things are completely out of control and then the
[25:31.800 --> 25:43.160]  media spends it that they're Nazis when Hungary was attacked by the Nazis it's incredible
[25:43.160 --> 25:49.560]  I mean these people take boats across or they walk in out of the Middle East Middle Eastern
[25:49.560 --> 26:01.160]  countries won't take any of them but that's okay but then they're Nazis China says USA
[26:01.160 --> 26:07.880]  must take more Syrian refugees that will take zero that's an actual announcement right
[26:07.880 --> 26:15.440]  Bart breaks that down Finland as I said yesterday to raise taxes on the quote wealthy to cover
[26:15.440 --> 26:22.280]  refugee costs Sweden is to make citizens howls illegals migrants they're migrants now when
[26:22.280 --> 26:29.560]  they move into your house trek to Vienna after Austria suspends trains associated press and
[26:29.560 --> 26:34.880]  already mentioned all this but I'm just showing you the articles video shows refugees fed
[26:34.880 --> 26:41.760]  like animals in a pen in Hungary camp Austrian volunteer who filmed footage in Hungary says
[26:41.760 --> 26:50.720]  treatment of refugees like Guantanamo in Europe no it's not Guantanamo in Europe but that's
[26:50.720 --> 26:58.440]  the Austrian volunteer I bet is even Austrian who thinks that that Austria is the place
[26:58.440 --> 27:03.880]  for the whole world to come to get free stuff no one else has taken these people but fundamentally
[27:03.880 --> 27:10.120]  the West who's bad has to I'm sick of it I'm tired of it here's another article BBC
[27:10.120 --> 27:14.880]  video compares sandwiches being thrown to migrants to Nazi concentration camps Paul
[27:14.880 --> 27:21.080]  Joseph Watson info wars.com emotionally manipulative propaganda piece reinforces media narrative
[27:21.080 --> 27:27.880]  of refugee crisis it's like Serbia had food aid stations that the crow ads and I'm not
[27:27.880 --> 27:32.920]  a serve I'm on a crud on a Muslim so I'm not taking a side it's the fact this happened
[27:32.920 --> 27:39.840]  in the mid nineties ITN and BBC had to admit they were part of it famous photos you can
[27:39.840 --> 27:46.560]  pull them up online of a guy that has TB up against the fence trying to get into the food
[27:46.560 --> 27:57.640]  trucks now you watch the rest of footage there's fat people right next to him but he had TB
[27:57.640 --> 28:02.900]  he got food but they said here are Serbs putting people in concentration camps no the Serbs
[28:02.900 --> 28:11.200]  fought the Nazis they're not Nazis they didn't start the war either the globalist did but
[28:11.200 --> 28:16.920]  again it's an inversion of reality and the Clintons bombed that country repeatedly even
[28:16.920 --> 28:21.480]  though the UN admits double the Serbs died of any other groups and our government funded
[28:21.480 --> 28:27.800]  Albanian radical Muslims connected to Al Qaeda to attack and take one third of Serbia so
[28:27.800 --> 28:34.280]  radical Islam is being used to take over Europe we can see the pattern it's a playbook it's
[28:34.280 --> 28:43.400]  being done amazing but meanwhile we have the footage can we show the footage we showed
[28:43.400 --> 28:48.080]  yesterday of the guy trying to give him aid out of the bag there in Hungary and being mobbed
[28:48.080 --> 28:53.240]  and attacked if you're a TV viewer so that so that folks can see this I mean he's here
[28:53.240 --> 29:01.320]  trying to give teenagers bags of aid and they just rip it and take it away from it but he's
[29:01.320 --> 29:07.680]  a Nazi because he did it you see it's not nice to give people food you white Europeans
[29:07.680 --> 29:14.440]  scum what's your problem you should have slit your throat and poured blood into their mouths
[29:14.440 --> 29:18.760]  gouged your eyeballs out with corkscrews and if you have any white children you should
[29:18.760 --> 29:26.120]  have barbecued them and fed them to these gods you filth you scum you aid worker you
[29:26.120 --> 29:33.560]  know you're bad Guantanamo Bay torture and that's what BBC and all of them are putting
[29:33.560 --> 29:43.000]  out I mean this is so horrible how dare him give them food filth anyways we were against
[29:43.000 --> 29:46.360]  doing this to Syria and all these countries this is a global destabilization program
[29:46.360 --> 29:53.520]  these people are victims most unbounded we're on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones
[29:53.520 --> 30:03.800]  and the GCN radio network ISIS has demanded that Syrian Christians pay an Islam tax this
[30:03.800 --> 30:08.920]  is being reported by world net daily ISIS terrorists gathered together dozens of Christian
[30:08.920 --> 30:13.960]  men in Syria and told them either to pay a Sharia inspired tax and sign on to a list
[30:13.960 --> 30:19.440]  of faith-based restrictions or pay a penalty that could include the loss of life among the
[30:19.440 --> 30:25.480]  restrictions Christians cannot own guns build places of worship show their crosses in public
[30:25.480 --> 30:30.600]  or even ring church bells the terrorists put forth their demands to Christians in a town
[30:30.600 --> 30:35.960]  that used to be dominated by the Christian faith but has been taken over by radical Muslims
[30:35.960 --> 30:41.200]  and while many followers of Islam will condemn these actions numerous people in power continue
[30:41.200 --> 30:47.040]  to fund groups like ISIS and Al Qaeda whether it's air dropping grenades or leaving behind
[30:47.040 --> 30:51.280]  billions of dollars worth of vehicles that they can use against us these terrorist groups

[33:28.640 --> 33:37.640]  me try with pleasure hands to take you in this time to promise lives to show you everyone
[33:37.640 --> 33:48.240]  what is the time of the season for love my main directive for my gut for my heart for
[33:48.240 --> 33:54.560]  my soul is to warn people is to take action and is to get the population out of its comfort
[33:54.560 --> 34:01.280]  zone into action you know before you go for a jog or before you go for a hike or before
[34:01.280 --> 34:05.120]  you go for a swim before you go for the gym sometimes you don't feel like doing it but
[34:05.120 --> 34:10.600]  15 minutes into it you're like man ought to do this more often this is fantastic well
[34:10.600 --> 34:15.040]  it's the same thing with getting politically involved it's kind of like travel you might
[34:15.040 --> 34:18.600]  go through periods in your life where you don't travel a lot but once you start traveling
[34:18.600 --> 34:23.560]  you catch the bug again and you want to travel the world or you want to go two hours away
[34:23.560 --> 34:31.080]  to some town on business it's still interesting to go see something different well fighting
[34:31.080 --> 34:37.560]  tyranny is the same way we need to get people out of their bubbles taking action getting
[34:37.560 --> 34:44.520]  involved and I don't care if it's in organic farming or taking youth groups out shooting
[34:44.520 --> 34:51.240]  or planting trees or going to the border and showing how it's wide open or exposing corrupt
[34:51.240 --> 34:57.000]  police or supporting good police or getting involved in your city council or getting
[34:57.000 --> 35:03.600]  involved exposing the private federal reserve promoting libertarian economics there's thousands
[35:03.600 --> 35:09.520]  of things you can do none of us are going to save the world by ourselves but by promoting
[35:09.520 --> 35:16.960]  a culture of liberty by getting involved and by voting with our dollars and supporting
[35:16.960 --> 35:25.320]  those that support a free open society we will crush the central government engineers
[35:25.320 --> 35:31.640]  that's why they want us to follow their language do what they say follow their political correctness
[35:31.640 --> 35:38.280]  because they can only rule over a bunch of jellyfish automatons they cannot rule over
[35:38.280 --> 35:46.080]  free men and women let me go through news now continuing with two out of three Hispanics
[35:46.080 --> 35:52.160]  oppose immigration increase oh but the media told me all Hispanics want wide open borders
[35:52.160 --> 35:59.000]  and you are racist and hate Hispanics if you don't want to have wide open borders I mean
[35:59.000 --> 36:07.720]  if we had wide open borders with some country that was rich and powerful and successful
[36:07.720 --> 36:12.800]  that'd be one thing but when we are bordering countries that are imploding and we're falling
[36:12.800 --> 36:21.480]  apart you can't have open borders I mean it's just simple and of course from what I've seen
[36:21.480 --> 36:29.400]  statistically the Hispanics I know are more concerned about open borders than the lazy
[36:29.400 --> 36:38.880]  stupid politically correct white people I know but therein lies the paradox and that's
[36:38.880 --> 36:43.520]  why the globalists are trying to bring in as many illegals as they can under the democratic
[36:43.520 --> 36:51.080]  party to forge them into a new socialist communist wing who will not assimilate that's why they're
[36:51.080 --> 36:55.920]  trying to not have English taught in schools now and have it be Spanish only primary across
[36:55.920 --> 37:02.400]  the country it's shifting to that even though English is the world language they don't want
[37:02.400 --> 37:07.680]  Hispanic children to have the world language and to be able to be upwardly mobile they
[37:07.680 --> 37:13.080]  want to keep them on their plantation under their Ku Klux Klan leadership of Mecha and
[37:13.080 --> 37:21.560]  Laraza which are carbon copies of the nights of the Ku Klux Klan they're just simply Hispanic
[37:21.560 --> 37:26.800]  just like the new Black Panther Party is even more extreme than the Ku Klux Klan I mean
[37:26.800 --> 37:35.680]  the exact same ideology the exact same rhetoric the exact same mindset all the Jew bashing
[37:35.680 --> 37:40.320]  that goes on and by the way I've gone and covered Mecha and Laraza grips all you hear
[37:40.320 --> 37:45.120]  about is the Jewish conspiracy you go cover black groups that are racist all you hear
[37:45.120 --> 37:51.800]  is about Jews all day you go cover a white extremist group it's all you hear and then
[37:51.800 --> 37:55.320]  and then of course everyone who's successful works for the Jews of course I didn't get
[37:55.320 --> 37:59.680]  up in the morning and do research I never had any success myself Jews gave me everything
[37:59.680 --> 38:06.440]  I've got hell they're so deceptive they'll even take that clip and say I admitted it
[38:06.440 --> 38:14.640]  was their failures and they want to claim somebody else was given what they got really
[38:14.640 --> 38:19.240]  I've had the ADL people attacking me and trying to get me shut off the air that's really
[38:19.240 --> 38:25.240]  what's going on and they've had some success I've been thrown off quite a few stations
[38:25.240 --> 38:29.200]  in the old days people don't listen to it anymore it's just weird to be attacked by
[38:29.200 --> 38:34.360]  the leftist Jewish lobby and then to be attacked by the white supremacist lobby who just makes
[38:34.360 --> 38:40.520]  up some weird narrative that you know Jews tell me what to do and I go to Tel Aviv and
[38:40.520 --> 38:44.960]  get orders I've never been to Israel but let me tell you it's really historical and neat
[38:44.960 --> 38:48.760]  I've had family that's been there and visited I'm going to visit Israel soon and I'm going
[38:48.760 --> 38:54.600]  to go do reports while I'm there as well but I won't be there getting marching orders
[38:54.600 --> 39:00.360]  it's like folks that said I was at the Vatican to get marching orders yeah that's real funny
[39:00.360 --> 39:11.360]  marching orders from the communist pope you know who gives me orders my guts my heart
[39:11.360 --> 39:16.480]  and then what's between my legs I'll be honest with you and by that I don't mean sexually
[39:16.480 --> 39:23.280]  I you know the little parts thing and for the big part I'm saying my manhood I cannot
[39:23.280 --> 39:28.200]  stand con artist I cannot stand scum and I know our listeners can't stand it either
[39:28.200 --> 39:34.880]  and I'm sick of it I'm tired of it and the truth is it's a hoax Hispanics aren't suicidal
[39:34.880 --> 39:40.160]  they're not insane and they know how rough Latin America is and they don't like people
[39:40.160 --> 39:46.120]  getting free healthcare and free babies and free tuition when in many states citizens
[39:46.120 --> 39:53.280]  of the state don't get in state tuition but illegals do it's discriminatory and it's wrong
[39:53.280 --> 40:06.800]  and here's another Gallup poll showing that continuing ladies and gentlemen mama Merkel
[40:06.800 --> 40:13.960]  that's the close quote from French news agency cheered by Syrians at refugee camp you know
[40:13.960 --> 40:18.840]  we've had Syrian girl on I've covered the plight of Syria there are some real refugees
[40:18.840 --> 40:25.920]  from Syria that quite frankly because NATO in the West did this to Syria we probably
[40:25.920 --> 40:30.920]  do have a responsibility to take them but here's the difference most of them we've looked
[40:30.920 --> 40:35.800]  at it it's been broken down or even from Syria or they're from the areas ruined by ISIS
[40:35.800 --> 40:40.560]  and Al Qaeda and folks that are Wahhabist or Sunnis working with them most Sunnis don't
[40:40.560 --> 40:47.960]  support this who are now basically been turned against by Saudi Arabia who can't get into
[40:47.960 --> 40:54.360]  Iraq so they're coming into Europe via Turkey Turkey's letting these folks come in get on

[46:09.080 --> 46:13.560]  brought stability to that country who wasn't perfect but then you put in the most horrible
[46:13.560 --> 46:17.160]  wicked murdering scum you can that's who runs our country
[46:20.040 --> 46:23.800]  and i used to think they were only destabilizing enemies like serbia given a third of their
[46:23.800 --> 46:27.880]  country to albania and the radical muslims now i realize they're going to give everything
[46:27.880 --> 46:33.240]  with the radical muslims because the globalists like the taliparianism they've lowered our political
[46:33.240 --> 46:37.960]  immune system to be so liberal we'll put up with anything we'll say what we're told we won't have
[46:37.960 --> 46:42.680]  any free speech and then they'll bring in radical people who'll bully all the rest of muslims into
[46:42.680 --> 46:49.720]  total tyranny and us along with them man that's filthy man that's evil man that's out of control
[46:51.160 --> 46:55.880]  how dare the democrats call us racists for not supporting obama care that doubles and triples
[46:55.880 --> 47:00.920]  cost written by the insurance companies how dare you have bodyguards michael more and try to keep
[47:00.920 --> 47:05.640]  poor people from defending themselves how dare you try to start a race war in this country
[47:05.640 --> 47:11.080]  how dare msnbc try to get people to randomly kill police so then the police can be forged into a
[47:11.080 --> 47:17.880]  paramilitary force to oppress the inner city more how dare you you wicked trash knowing full well
[47:17.880 --> 47:24.280]  what you're doing consciously premeditatedly let's go to this clip of the former deputy director of
[47:24.280 --> 47:31.320]  the cia i want to get your thoughts this morning about a story in the daily beast about 50 intelligence
[47:31.320 --> 47:38.280]  officials who have said that in some cases their reports have been altered by senior officials in
[47:38.280 --> 47:44.200]  some cases to make it look like the fight against isis and al-qaeda is going better than it might be
[47:44.200 --> 47:50.840]  what's your reaction to that so these are analysts at the u.s central command sent com which is
[47:50.840 --> 47:58.600]  actually conducting our operations in iraq and syria one of the central tenants one of the key
[47:58.600 --> 48:04.760]  aspects of the policymaking process in the united states is that analysts get to say what they think
[48:04.760 --> 48:11.000]  without any interference without anybody changing it so this is a very very serious charge i think
[48:11.000 --> 48:17.000]  it needs to be fully investigated and if there is truth that somebody has been meddling with their
[48:17.000 --> 48:23.000]  analysis i think um i think somebody needs to lose their job over it and there needs to be full
[48:23.000 --> 48:28.920]  transparency because they've been falsifying all of it they look when the military figured out we
[48:28.920 --> 48:34.520]  were openly arming al-qaeda they changed the name to isis we told you all this they didn't even change
[48:34.520 --> 48:41.000]  their name officially they just told the west that and then claimed al-qaeda had fallen this is a
[48:41.000 --> 48:49.320]  Saudi arabian proxy army now let's go back to the clip from three weeks ago that we've been airing
[48:49.320 --> 48:54.600]  with michael t flinn the former head of defense intelligence agency this is general flinn breaking
[48:54.600 --> 49:00.840]  down covering his own butt that hey we put al-qaeda in charge we knew they were doing it i followed
[49:00.840 --> 49:07.640]  orders and here's what's larger they also launched chemical weapons attacks on syria and then blamed
[49:07.640 --> 49:13.880]  it on them and that even came out the iraqi government admitted it others admitted it because
[49:13.880 --> 49:18.520]  the jihadis aren't fully controlled they want to be rock stars they shot video of themselves
[49:18.520 --> 49:24.600]  launching the chemical attacks and running around screaming on a hotbar obama goes you
[49:24.600 --> 49:30.040]  launch chemicals will invade and then al-qaeda launches chemicals i mean it's so old so let's
[49:30.040 --> 49:35.640]  go ahead and go to this clip for the sake of our viewers in 2012 your agency was saying quote the
[49:35.640 --> 49:40.760]  salafists the muslim brotherhood and al-qaeda in iraq are the major forces driving the insurgents
[49:40.760 --> 49:46.840]  in syria in 2012 the us was helping coordinate arms transfers to those same groups why did you
[49:46.840 --> 49:51.560]  not stop that if you're worried about the rise of quote unquote i mean i hate to say it's not my
[49:51.560 --> 49:57.800]  job but that my job was to was to ensure that the that the accuracy of our intelligence that was
[49:57.800 --> 50:04.920]  being presented was was as good as it could be and i will tell you it goes before 2012 i mean
[50:04.920 --> 50:09.320]  when we're when we're in iraq and we still had decisions to be made before there was a decision
[50:09.320 --> 50:15.720]  to pull out of iraq in 2011 i mean it was very clear what were we what we were going to face well i
[50:15.720 --> 50:19.320]  admire your frank very clear what we were going to let me let me just take one before we move on
[50:19.320 --> 50:23.640]  just to clarify once more you are basically saying that even in government at the time
[50:23.640 --> 50:27.480]  you knew those groups were around you saw this analysis and you were arguing against it but who
[50:27.480 --> 50:33.800]  wasn't listening i think uh i think administration the administration turned a blind eye to your
[50:33.800 --> 50:37.560]  analysis i don't know if they turned a blind eye i think it was a decision i think it was a willful
[50:37.560 --> 50:42.760]  decision a willful decision to go so we'll see that had salafist al-qaeda a willful decision to do
[50:42.760 --> 50:47.720]  what they're doing which which you have to really you have to really ask the president
[50:47.720 --> 50:53.240]  what is it that he actually is doing with the with the uh policy that is in place because
[50:53.240 --> 50:58.440]  it is very very confusing no it's not let me break it down yeah you guys at the pentagon
[50:59.320 --> 51:02.760]  are so close to this and you think you're not going to be sold out you haven't got it yet
[51:02.760 --> 51:09.320]  they are going to turn the middle east over to radical islam merged with communism
[51:09.320 --> 51:17.880]  that's the checkmate move by the new world order and the central banks and saudi arabia do you
[51:17.880 --> 51:20.600]  understand that do you have that through your head okay
[51:23.800 --> 51:27.960]  and then if the states don't go along with it here in the united states the globalists are
[51:27.960 --> 51:32.520]  going to bomb stuff and say the patriots did it or they're going to find reasons to indict people
[51:32.520 --> 51:37.240]  like the texas attorney general another trying to indict the governor right now and i'm not going
[51:37.240 --> 51:42.360]  to get any any more of that i mean do you understand they got feds following the governor around all
[51:42.360 --> 51:46.680]  the time right now trying to find him with a crooked toenail to throw him in jail and by the
[51:46.680 --> 51:51.000]  way the fbi doesn't like doing it i mean most people in the fb are not really bad they're
[51:51.000 --> 51:57.800]  compartmentalized but it's so dirty now they're just going i cannot believe we're this evil and
[51:57.800 --> 52:05.880]  i'm not going to get into my sources folks but i mean i have sources i just that's a problem my job
[52:05.880 --> 52:12.120]  man is i know so much more than i can even say because i can't reveal sources but the reason
[52:12.120 --> 52:17.800]  i know they're making their move is it's bad it's bad they're looking at a whole bunch of governors
[52:17.800 --> 52:23.000]  they're going to arrest they're looking at taking out people in legislatures governments even looking
[52:23.000 --> 52:27.080]  at sending hit teams around to kill key people that are going to go along with us and all these
[52:27.080 --> 52:30.840]  generals that are now telling the truth and stuff you know they're going to send a hit team to kill
[52:30.840 --> 52:34.760]  you and your family right they'll say you suicided your wife and kids so i'm going to tell the
[52:34.760 --> 52:39.240]  generals and everybody else something right now you're going to preside over the destruction of
[52:39.240 --> 52:48.200]  america and the world sliding into a new dark age and you are going to end up getting locked in
[52:48.200 --> 52:54.120]  prison or killed probably because of your inaction and your and and your cowards i mean i'm going
[52:54.120 --> 52:59.560]  to say it right now it's not enough to say you know why are we turning the world over to al-qaeda
[52:59.560 --> 53:03.960]  and radical islam it doesn't make sense it's not enough to say they're fixing intelligence
[53:03.960 --> 53:08.760]  you got to go all the way or we're going to lose everything i mean do you understand that
[53:13.000 --> 53:14.040]  i hope you understand that
[53:16.680 --> 53:21.480]  because they're looking at taking out the state governments right now they've got the military
[53:21.480 --> 53:26.120]  training to take out state governments right now why do you think the military is so freaked out
[53:26.120 --> 53:31.000]  and sending signals out going uh something's not right uh oh we shouldn't be funding al-qaeda false
[53:31.000 --> 53:36.200]  intelligence this administration isn't too good because they actually have come to the brass now
[53:36.200 --> 53:42.120]  and gotten them ready for this and had a huge purge of the top people and then put in a bunch of
[53:44.200 --> 53:50.440]  desk jockeys who've never been in combat in all the key positions and i i don't know if the
[53:50.440 --> 53:54.920]  communists and the socialists and all these people realize and even george soros who've never been
[53:54.920 --> 53:59.160]  in combat he's taken down a bunch of countries this is not going to be like taken down iraq or taken
[53:59.160 --> 54:07.480]  down um ukraine or something this is much more complex and you just it's not going to happen
[54:07.480 --> 54:12.040]  i mean you're not going to get away with it you may blow the country up in the process
[54:13.240 --> 54:18.600]  but it's not a battle you win i mean you understand that this is mutually assured destruction
[54:18.600 --> 54:24.600]  we know who you are globalist we know your game plan the military now knows the military listens to
[54:24.600 --> 54:31.000]  this show we've already sent the analysis out which anybody else can see what it is we're just
[54:31.000 --> 54:37.720]  willing to say it openly other people are now parroting it do you realize it's game over unless
[54:37.720 --> 54:45.480]  you just want to blow the whole country up i mean do you think all the lemmings and all the trendies
[54:47.160 --> 54:50.680]  just because you've got 45 percent of the public that can't wipe their own hind end
[54:50.680 --> 54:56.120]  those people don't count in a game like this just because you've got a bunch of morons that
[54:56.120 --> 55:01.320]  will do whatever you tell them and you intercult members it'll speak like you say speak and do
[55:01.320 --> 55:07.560]  what you say does it mean that with real people you're going to have a victory
[55:07.560 --> 55:20.120]  but now is the time for police military fbi you name it the country's been taken over
[55:20.920 --> 55:27.080]  you are disloyal to yourself to your family to your own skin i mean it's getting so obvious now
[55:27.880 --> 55:32.840]  without evil this new world order is that they plan to get rid of the old existing power structure
[55:32.840 --> 55:37.240]  which wasn't perfect but at least you wanted to boss hog and be a big powerful rich country
[55:39.160 --> 55:43.560]  and new cutting taxes brought in more money to the government so why not you know boss hog
[55:43.560 --> 55:47.960]  you know kennedy why not cut taxes by 50 percent and more money will come in and he did it and it
[55:47.960 --> 55:51.400]  happened so they said you know i'm gonna cut taxes more and they said no you're not boom
[55:54.520 --> 55:59.880]  we got an elite that wants us poor and stupid i'll take boss hog over that any day
[55:59.880 --> 56:06.360]  so i'm not romanticizing the old power structure this isn't even the old power structure this is
[56:06.360 --> 56:13.080]  just people in the system who aren't completely insane you got to understand that it's a fetish
[56:13.080 --> 56:16.440]  it's a power trip with the globalist to bring down america and bring down europe
[56:18.360 --> 56:22.040]  because it's the source of their power it's where they get their money their innovation
[56:22.040 --> 56:27.800]  their their brains but they're worried about it because the destruction of the elites
[56:27.800 --> 56:33.560]  the centralized elites has come out of europe and the united states before so they want american
[56:33.560 --> 56:41.480]  and european power but they also despise it and they want to sew up everything bring down the
[56:41.480 --> 56:48.280]  world and be the last men standing on top of the hill of skulls and that dog isn't going to hunt
[56:51.000 --> 56:56.440]  you're not going to get away with it and because your battle plan has been laid out
[56:56.440 --> 57:02.040]  the more you execute it the more what we've said will be seen as prophecy when it's not
[57:02.040 --> 57:08.200]  prophecy i've got your playbook i know what your hand signs are i know what your mindset is i've

[01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:45.400]  press and also in local news barbershop find $750 for refusing to cut a woman's hair and it described
[01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:50.360]  the lady coming in and they said look we're we're a men's barbershop just like there are women's
[01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:59.800]  salons just like there is curves for women's only fitness gyms that my good buddy founded and
[01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:07.880]  owns the ceo has been on the broadcast it's just crazy and one guess we had likened it to if you
[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:14.360]  owned a dodge car going into a mercedes dealership and saying i want you to work on my american car
[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:19.160]  and they go we work on german cars we're going into a japanese car place i mean they've got the
[01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:23.000]  equipment they've got the parts they've got the mechanics they don't want to work on a japanese
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:29.400]  car it'd be like going into a italian ferrari repair shop and telling them to work on your
[01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:39.000]  ford pickup it's not discriminatory that's what they do it'd be like showing up to nas car and
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:45.000]  saying i want to see a circus they look at you and say we we we race cars we don't have lions and
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:51.720]  tigers and bears oh my but this is where political correctness is gone and people laugh at it as kooky
[01:10:52.280 --> 01:11:02.280]  no he got fined $750 for gender discrimination i personally in my life go to barbershops since
[01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:07.320]  i was a little kid you go in you wait five ten minutes your dad gets his haircut you get your
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:14.120]  haircut you're in you're out a lot of these men's barbershops have playboys laying around
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:19.240]  or they have beer i don't know about this gentleman's barbershop but i know that's a trend
[01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:25.800]  where you got women's shops and you got men's shops uh or maybe there's pent up girls in the
[01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:33.400]  walls and and beer or or video games i don't know about his barbershop i'm just guessing but
[01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:41.880]  but now there's articles out feminist claim it's sexist to compliment women a lawyer sent a woman
[01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:47.400]  a message saying he thought she was quote stunning in her linkedin photo she went public
[01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:53.880]  attacking other feminist groups shamed him saying you don't talk to women see they're god
[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:59.960]  you don't even talk to them lawyer who accused barrister of sexism has described men online
[01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:06.520]  as hot and trolled for men so see it's about a power thing that's in the london telegraph today
[01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:11.640]  most women are great most men are great are there some men out there that are arrogant pigs sure
[01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:17.560]  are there women out there that are crazy absolutely but with the modern feminist movement it's about
[01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:23.640]  power and we see christians getting locked up we're not you know giving out marriage licenses
[01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:29.880]  we see all sorts of persecution if somebody won't bake a certain cake i mean am i going to go
[01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:36.040]  to some black fraternal organization and demand i'd be allowed in i mean or how about a masonic
[01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:42.120]  order they have them for men and women can i go join women of the eastern star a masonic
[01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:48.600]  female organization look at this san francisco jails to house transgender inmates based on gender
[01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:54.200]  preference and then they had national debates about this the last few days our guest johnny interval
[01:12:54.200 --> 01:13:02.440]  now is the website barberstandsup.com he's going to go on fox news today but he wanted to come on
[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:07.320]  first here because he's a listener we're honored to have him uh johnny thank you for coming on
[01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:14.120]  my barbie air i believe i'm pronouncing it right is the name of your barber shop i'm told it's an
[01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:21.160]  upscale men's only facility they have men's only gyms too i mean i guess those are hateful this is
[01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:28.840]  crazy uh describe to us what exactly happened and where all this is going now uh well where it's
[01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:34.440]  going and what happened uh a few months ago about four months ago exactly a young lady came in to
[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:40.360]  get a haircut here in our barber shop and um she was declined service um because she's a woman and
[01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:46.200]  we have an all male clientele here uh at that point he well became very irate we tried to comfort
[01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:53.240]  her offering another place for her to go um we've had women come in in the past and i want to get
[01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:57.480]  haircuts and you know they've had they've had no problem with it it's just you know sometimes you
[01:13:57.480 --> 01:14:03.320]  get someone who's a little more aggressive and that's what happens uh you know we offered to pay
[01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:06.680]  for a haircut at the other place she wasn't having that and i really never gave it another thought
[01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:12.040]  and then a few weeks later uh or months later rather uh i got a letter that said i was fine
[01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:19.320]  set $750 and i could either accept that payment and admit my guilt to which you know obviously i
[01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:25.880]  don't think i'm guilty of anything and or fight it uh i've been facing to $10,000 in fines to stand
[01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:33.160]  with my shop so after kicking it around a lot um i've decided the i think i maybe you can tell
[01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:37.240]  me something different i think my best course of action is to pay the fine and then appeal
[01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:44.440]  that uh i was afraid that maybe once i said you know yeah i'm guilty by paying the fine
[01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:49.640]  then they could file lawsuits for discrimination after the fact you know like they're just waiting
[01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:53.560]  well you should talk to a lawyer about your particular state laws but but in general this
[01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:58.920]  is outrageous uh they have curves the biggest fitness chain in the world you made that point
[01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:04.200]  to me off here it's a great parallel that's for women only uh they have golf courses that are
[01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:08.600]  for women only tennis courts that are for women only i think that's totally normal sometimes
[01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:13.720]  women want to get away from men they don't want to have to dress up uh that makes sense sometimes
[01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:19.080]  men want to go be part of a men's club and not be around women so you can tell jokes and
[01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:24.440]  do whatever you want i mean it's just common sense they're waging war against this uh it's bizarre
[01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:30.680]  and so if i was you personally describe it for me was it a state or local agency i know you're in
[01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:36.360]  washington pa right outside uh pittsburgh i mean describe exactly what agency did this
[01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:42.440]  well describe exactly a gentleman came down from pittsburgh i assume he was from the state
[01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:49.080]  he came in and uh sort of you know strong just into talking i told him i'm a very honest person
[01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:53.000]  you know i told him exactly what happened same as i'm telling you right now and my statement
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:57.160]  has really well gotten me in trouble saying that yeah i did turn her down based on gender so
[01:15:57.160 --> 01:16:00.760]  according to the law you know i did break it but you know according to the law of
[01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:06.920]  you know that law is unconstitutional i think so well i mean i mean you're allowed to have a
[01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:11.240]  barber shop for men just like they can have salons for women i would think so but yeah it's a state
[01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:16.120]  law the answer is you know i mean it's it's it's and that's when i called their lawyer to ask you
[01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:20.280]  know what should i do to this fact you know what can i do they uh he said he couldn't tell me you
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:24.600]  know i called the state and he said it's a conflict of interest i can't give you any information i
[01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:28.680]  think how can i prevent this in the future can i put a disclaimer on my website and he would just
[01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:35.240]  read me over and over the four sentenced umbrella law you know you can't discriminate against you
[01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:41.560]  know any race sex religion and that's it i mean and then this is bottom line black and white so
[01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:45.320]  you know this appeal i think it's going to be an uphill battle well i'll tell you the answer is for
[01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:50.040]  i don't want to give curves any trouble but because they're patriots but i would i would find some
[01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:54.280]  women only gym and i think you should go with the news camera and say i'm here to go in the
[01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:59.480]  women's locker room and i'm here and you got to let me work out and just see how they like it because
[01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:05.000]  this is this is about terrorizing men now tell me about your place i see a guy drinking beer back
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:09.640]  there i'm told this is a place i mean it's really just kind of like a bar where guys can hang around
[01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:15.000]  and shoot to you know what i can give you the grant or play yeah let's do it you want to do it um
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:19.400]  you know basically it's uh this is the place this is uh max he's got a good gentleman right now
[01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:26.280]  he's enjoying a frosty beverage we got three stations we're a very small place um you know
[01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:31.320]  i just uh one guy trying to make a living out here and then we have a bore area and in our bore
[01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:36.920]  area we have a kegarator that is a completely complimentary and we have you know different
[01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:42.280]  boozes and it's a wine fridge and then for the kids and stuff so there's water skater aid stuff like
[01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:48.360]  that and like a little coffee area over there and uh that's pretty much it well i would come get my
[01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:52.920]  haircut there there was a place like that that's awesome yeah it's a pretty uh people like it that's
[01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:59.160]  for sure do you think that well i mean from my experience if you pay this because i've had some
[01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:03.800]  similar things go on then they probably will have the eoc come in next and say give us a hundred
[01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:09.800]  thousand dollars there's folks that make a living off this i know i i know that's gonna happen damn
[01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:18.440]  it uh we the young lady and i i had sent her an apology i didn't want any i the initial newspaper um
[01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:23.800]  i told don't put her name in there you know because i didn't want any kind of repercussions for that
[01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:30.520]  and uh because it wasn't under any state state papers but they did it anyway and i sent her an
[01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:34.440]  apology on facebook i said i don't even know you you know and i said for whatever reason you felt
[01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:39.080]  you were uh wronged and i feel bad about that you you know you took the course of action you felt
[01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:47.960]  was necessary and uh you know whatever and she responded by stuff hopefully what she said it
[01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:53.480]  will uh click will you know will help me out but she said she was only coming here to make sure that
[01:18:53.480 --> 01:19:00.440]  i was up to standards i knew it got her boyfriend the week after because she demands perfection
[01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:07.240]  in her haircut so i don't know man then there was some other choice sounds like a really sick power
[01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:13.480]  trip and i'd say to this young woman do you understand this is social engineering by very
[01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:19.000]  sophisticated foundations on record to break up the family turn everybody against each other
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:24.520]  and you know there's called being cool and minding your own business uh so what if guys want a place
[01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:30.520]  to get their haircut and drink beer women have all their places do you really want men coming into
[01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:37.560]  where you're at i'm gonna be a great example of we do a lot of wedding parties here and uh you know
[01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:42.360]  guys getting married brings in his whole crew we lock the doors close the blinds are reading playboys
[01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:49.160]  smoking cigars drinking beer doing shots swearing for it whatever guys want to do if i say a woman
[01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:53.880]  were to come in they would immediately lose that vibe they would immediately have to act gentlemanly
[01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:58.120]  they wouldn't be able to square a drink for it read the playboys that have a high paint and immediately
[01:19:58.120 --> 01:20:03.320]  the entire atmosphere of the shop will change uh you know what i mean so that wouldn't have anything
[01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:07.560]  to do with me it would have to do with them they would feel like they had to act a certain way
[01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:11.560]  like they're in public now you know when the blinds are closed and sure sometimes i go out with my
[01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:17.160]  buddies and and and you know if the girls go it's a totally different vibe a totally different evening
[01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:22.360]  and and and so i mean can't our guys allowed to be alone that's what this comes down to are we
[01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:28.280]  allowed to have any male culture it doesn't seem like it i know when a guy comes here with this
[01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:33.720]  girlfriend he never brings you the second time i'll tell you that well i mean i've seen similar
[01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:38.600]  places i know they're popular i know they're growing so i guess that's the type of place it was uh
[01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:45.160]  and it just you know seattle has told city employees you'll be fired if you bring a brown paper bag to
[01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:50.920]  work uh we see this is a symbol of hate no one ever said a brown paper bag was a symbol of hate
[01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:57.560]  no one ever said it's just about them being able to ban whatever they want and i would just say to
[01:20:57.560 --> 01:21:03.480]  this young lady in the state so if i want to go to curves or i want to go to any other women's only
[01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:10.200]  thing or to a women's church group then we can find them if you don't let me in i mean is this
[01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:17.560]  really where women want to go i don't know i guess it might be i i certainly hope not because
[01:21:17.560 --> 01:21:22.600]  that's a shame somebody told me that you have to call children purple penguins in school now they
[01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:26.440]  can't be associated as boys or girls they was falling for life on there's a 10,000 million
[01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:32.920]  viewers right now come on in and say hi yeah that's how i heard i mean you can't there's no
[01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:38.680]  individuality anymore you know what i mean it's it's just not an america that's uh it's not america
[01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:44.680]  you know it's incredible well i mean what it is is a cult brainwashing facility because you know
[01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:51.160]  first they said a decade ago at the universities we need to ban he she boy girl uh man woman husband
[01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:54.200]  wife because if you're not a husband or wife it's hurtful if you're not a boy or girl it's
[01:21:54.200 --> 01:22:00.760]  hurtful as if you existing you see hurts them it's the opposite of tolerance they're intolerant
[01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:06.280]  and so now schools across the country are getting rid of the word boy and girl he or she and you've
[01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:12.920]  got to use weird prefixes or purple penguin because they say we've got to talk like they say
[01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:18.600]  i mean it's so crazy i can't even believe it i i i i was first time i heard it yesterday and it's
[01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:25.400]  and i didn't have a response to it it's insane well we're gentlemen and so we like to be nice to
[01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:32.040]  people and and so we start using the words they say and it sets a precedent to where now we're
[01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:37.480]  basically slaves to it the answer is not being politically correct and see that's why i think
[01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:41.400]  she showed up that's why a lot of these feminists do this around the country in the world is let's
[01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:46.920]  face it she doesn't like a place with leather barber chairs and guys read and playboy and
[01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:53.480]  drinking beer that's chauvinistic that's bad that's evil and that's why this happened to you but i
[01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:58.040]  think in the end they're gonna probably change the law they're gonna probably back off of this
[01:22:58.040 --> 01:23:01.720]  because it makes them look so stupid and i would guess you're gonna end up getting a lot more
[01:23:01.720 --> 01:23:07.080]  business you know i hope so and i hope i can aid in that fight uh against this you know what i mean
[01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:12.840]  i uh a lot of your listeners actually contacted me and uh they said you know you would be a good
[01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:18.920]  place to to you know fight i guess you know because that's really what it is a fight and
[01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:25.000]  i can't do it by myself i mean i'm just one guy you know what i mean but uh i think uh right now
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:30.520]  it's uh it's a hot topic and i'm at the forefront you know one of the people at the forefront of it
[01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:37.160]  and i certainly want to do my part to have this not become uh the norm you know i want to get rid
[01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:43.320]  of that so well the harassment of small businesses in this country by these people is just getting
[01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:50.360]  completely out of control and insane now the eoc is saying that if someone has a secret disability
[01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:55.880]  that you don't know about they don't tell you about that they can later claim you hurt them
[01:23:55.880 --> 01:24:00.360]  and their disability even though you weren't aware of it and then pay damages so this is meant to
[01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:05.880]  sabotage our industry how are we supposed to operate as a country where these type of totalitarian
[01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:11.320]  rules you can't you absolutely cannot do it you just can't but they say set everything against you
[01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:17.960]  there's no way that you can make it you know what i mean and i can't it's it's just absolutely
[01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:22.760]  ridiculous it gets worse every day every single day it's worse on mars well you try to be sweet
[01:24:22.760 --> 01:24:27.400]  too you try to be a gentleman i think the answer is stop being i'm still be gentlemanly obviously
[01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:32.040]  this is my opinion but start being a little more aggressive and i would have pulled a camera out
[01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:36.920]  i know you're a nice guy a business owner i'd say lady there's women's places all over that don't do
[01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:42.600]  men's hair are you saying they're bad too you know why are you starting a fight with me uh and
[01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:46.680]  that's what it comes down to i think when you did apologize when you were nice she took that as
[01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:52.120]  weakness wanted to push it probably got a lawyer and uh you know there's not a lot of jobs in this
[01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:57.000]  country so you know maybe maybe you're gonna be bankrolling her future i mean i'm not saying
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:00.920]  that's what's happening that potentially could be happening and we need to put it into this
[01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:05.720]  i certainly worried about that i certainly would not want that to happen i'd burn this
[01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:10.600]  place to the ground before they happen but to be honest with you i uh you know i gotta work
[01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:13.720]  every day you know and i mean i believe everybody should should have a job should do what they're
[01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:18.760]  supposed to do you know every one of my family has worked for generations and generations back we uh
[01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:23.960]  you know my family's been business owners in this city for god five generations back
[01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:29.880]  from ice cream stops in 1921 all the way up to my barber shop now and uh you know we're still
[01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:34.680]  going to try to tear it down you know the dozen i don't know anything about her personal life but
[01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:41.400]  you know from her actions it clearly you know it says it all speaks volumes actually speak
[01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:47.160]  volumes i think well all over europe especially in in england they have men and women's clubs
[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:51.560]  and women go after work and have drinks smoke cigarettes or whatever and read magazines and
[01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:56.680]  talk about women stuff because they want to be around women and then men have their clubs and
[01:25:56.680 --> 01:26:01.400]  then they have clubs where both men and women go to them that's just normal why do you think there's
[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:08.040]  this attack on just normal human activity well you know i don't know but i i made a point the other
[01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:12.360]  day that it just seems like they're they're intentionally starting these fights with us
[01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:18.920]  you know a couple weeks ago there was that uh some sort of award show or kaitlyn janer won an award
[01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:26.760]  for being a hero and they marine lost the award and it just seemed to me like they just invented
[01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:31.480]  that whole scenario you know what i mean like why a marine they because the certain group of people
[01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:35.560]  are going to get pissed off when a marine you know what i mean and a certain other group of people
[01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:39.080]  are going to be upset as she didn't and they they're just pitting each other against each other all
[01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:43.800]  the time and you know the blacks versus the whites who gave her some strength the whoever you know the
[01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:50.600]  guys were the girls the penguins were the purple people it's just uh that that's what's going on
[01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:55.880]  i mean it's to me i preach it all day long on my show if any of my guys can tell you you know i
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:02.520]  i preach well i mean i would guess you're a live and let live probably a libertarian type guy too
[01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:07.000]  the thing is libertarians and patriots are some of the most open people out there but
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:11.560]  we want to be able to live our lives like we want that's what real freedom is not adopt this
[01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:16.600]  new totalitarianism we got about three minutes left well obviously johnny interval get an update
[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:21.880]  from you as this unfolds i know you're going on fox news and some other channels today but i would
[01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:27.000]  just point out when you're on there this is a culture war if they can make men's barbershops
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:32.440]  except women then they can make us accept anything i love women but women deserve to have you know
[01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:38.040]  their own places like curves and i mean you know what to say but just say that this is part of a war
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:43.880]  on men having any any area i mean the new james bond they're saying that he's going to be politically
[01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:48.680]  correct and apologize for being a chauvinist not in this new movie but the next movie i mean they
[01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:56.440]  are really just attacking men being men it's crazy it really i mean i don't know what's next but
[01:27:56.440 --> 01:28:01.880]  it ain't gonna be good you know it ain't gonna be good at least on the path we're born and uh like
[01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:07.320]  i said i hope i can aid in the fight for this you know i certainly intend to well good job speaking
[01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:11.720]  out a lot of folks would just cower and hand everything over and apologize and just say here's
[01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:16.840]  all my money here's my car put your kids in the street worship her slit your throat you know give

[01:33:54.200 --> 01:34:00.040]  the nightly news is tonight's seven o'clock central uh briefly we fund a lot of our operation
[01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:07.080]  with high quality goods and services and my patriot supply has been a sponsor for three
[01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:13.640]  four years for us they are hands down the best quality storeable food at the most competitive
[01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:20.200]  prices for two years i've been going back and forth with them about info war select an idea i had
[01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:28.680]  of just their best lines their freshest food private labeled for info wars and it's info war
[01:34:28.680 --> 01:34:33.800]  select and we have their ceo on yesterday they're one of the biggest food companies now they're so
[01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:38.520]  successful because they're so competitive and he he said what he said to me off very kind of didn't
[01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:44.680]  like saying it yes we've given you the authorization to sell this at the lowest price they've ever
[01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:51.080]  sold food period they're already very competitive but in two weeks this has to end because of their
[01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:55.720]  contracts with other major companies and we'll still have an incredibly low price with info
[01:34:55.720 --> 01:35:01.720]  war select it'll be matching whatever their lowest prices we still sell my patriot supply products
[01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:07.720]  the exact same products they're just a little bit more money at infowarstore.com it's just info war
[01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:14.760]  select is their full spectrum of food private labeled to info wars so the info war select.com
[01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:21.320]  or go to infowarstore.com and you can go right in and get it from my patriot or you can get it from
[01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:27.640]  info wars and we basically some of the food packs are a little bit different mixes a little bit
[01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:31.640]  different you know here and there some of it's the exact same thing but but it's all super high
[01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:37.880]  quality and the exact same weight the exact same purchasing power and then the small profit we're
[01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:43.160]  making because that's what I believe in in capitalism is selling more at a lower price
[01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:47.720]  and then you dominate the market then you're more successful then you can fund your operation
[01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:53.960]  we're true capitalists so info war select at infowarstore.com with all the things happening in the

[01:37:00.760 --> 01:37:05.560]  went out this weekend and folks bought him drinks bought him dinner but a few folks walked over
[01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:11.800]  wanted to fight him until they saw it said prison so hillary is about as popular as cyanide right
[01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:18.840]  now even in a liberal town like austin texas and speaking of that our next guest can speak to the
[01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:24.440]  the situation with the clintons he can talk basically to all of it in the 25 minutes we have
[01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:29.240]  with joseph farah joseph farah worked some of the biggest newspapers in the country as editor
[01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:35.720]  he then started the western journalism center in the early 1990s that was listed as the number one
[01:37:35.720 --> 01:37:41.720]  enemy of the clintons in the documents they got last year from the clinton foundation they're based
[01:37:41.720 --> 01:37:47.080]  at his library and farah said it was so stunning when he first got it that he only released a small
[01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:52.200]  part of it now they're doing more stories on it and ready to tell us more about what's in it but
[01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:59.400]  released clinton files on media enemies and how they foresaw the rise of new media they wouldn't
[01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:06.360]  control now matt drudge was in politico yesterday as the number one news political site in the world
[01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:13.160]  even dwarfing facebook but we go back to who really was first and you've got to say it's joseph
[01:38:13.160 --> 01:38:18.600]  farah sure ron paul was with newsletters and so were other folks out there and we we owe that to
[01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:24.280]  them very goldwater was talking like we're talking back in the 50s and 60s senator goldwater what a
[01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:32.520]  great president he would have made but joseph farah really deserves our thanks wnd.com there's so
[01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:38.200]  much to get in the limited time we have but he warned in the last election that we were going
[01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:42.520]  to really see an attempt to overthrow the country and now we're seeing and i want to see what he
[01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:47.800]  thinks is coming next uh joseph farah i could ask a lot of questions but what do you think's front
[01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:55.720]  and center my friend well i think alex we're seeing something going on now with this invasion both
[01:38:55.720 --> 01:39:01.400]  you know that's been going on in the united states for a long time as you've been reporting
[01:39:01.400 --> 01:39:07.800]  for many many years a lot of people didn't really get excited about it until you know massive numbers
[01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:12.840]  of people started coming over the border here and now we're seeing it of course in in europe
[01:39:12.840 --> 01:39:18.280]  and we've got you know the president of the united states saying hey we'll take some of those refugees
[01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:23.640]  off the hands of europe you know we've got plenty of space in this country we can handle no you're
[01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:29.640]  virtually an unlimited number of uh so-called refugees who you know i don't think they're
[01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:35.640]  refugees at all what's what's stunning about what we see going on i think uh in europe particularly
[01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:44.040]  right now is that the you know uh these are mostly sunni muslims who uh are uh you know
[01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:52.440]  storming into europe and uh they're they're not the victims of what's been going on in the middle
[01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:59.400]  east for so long i mean the sunni muslims are the perpetrators of the horrors that we've seen
[01:39:59.400 --> 01:40:04.040]  uh not not just recently but really for a very long time in the middle east they're the ones
[01:40:04.040 --> 01:40:09.880]  taking over libya egypt syria iraq they're the majority i'm not demonizing them as a whole but
[01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:14.680]  undoubtedly they're saudi arabian backed you're absolutely right so what is the west thinking
[01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:20.360]  socialist merkel and others advertising come here so hundreds of thousands turn into millions
[01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:25.160]  and they tell german women don't wear short skirts i mean where are the political correct people on
[01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:31.400]  this why does the left have a fetish on sexual mutilation women can't drive cars and wearing
[01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:37.560]  bags on their heads why does the left worship radical islam really it's it's it shows that
[01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:43.320]  they don't mean what what they say they mean i mean it there aren't too many more stark examples
[01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:48.680]  than this uh you know these are the multicultural people too they're the ones who are always telling
[01:40:48.680 --> 01:40:54.920]  us you know every culture is is great they're all equal some are more equal than others and
[01:40:54.920 --> 01:41:02.760]  apparently this that perpetrates the horrors on on women uh anybody who disagrees with them in terms
[01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:11.320]  of their spiritual outlook or pretty much anything else uh this is this they embrace these folks uh
[01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:16.760]  so where's the tolerance that they're always talking about where is the pluralism that they're
[01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:23.800]  always talking about all these values that the so-called progressives espouse uh we can now see
[01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:29.240]  that uh they don't really mean what they say but getting back alex if you don't mind to the point
[01:41:29.240 --> 01:41:36.360]  i was trying to get at is you know the the real victims in the middle east are the christians and
[01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:41.400]  other religious minority groups but of all of them the christians are the are the biggest
[01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:47.000]  targets they're the ones who are caught in the crossfire they're the ones who are a real distinct
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:53.640]  minority uh you know you've got sunnis you've got shia and the next group is the christians who are
[01:41:53.640 --> 01:42:00.920]  not armed who are not attacking anybody who don't want to you know they don't commit jihad and uh
[01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:05.720]  and they're being you know they're they're very lives are at risk every single day in the middle
[01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:12.520]  east do we do anything to help those refugees by the way these refugees i'm i'm one of them i'm a
[01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:19.640]  descendant of these refugees these refugees would assimilate so quickly our culture they'd be a
[01:42:19.640 --> 01:42:27.800]  blessing to our culture they love liberty uh they are hardworking people they don't come to take
[01:42:27.800 --> 01:42:37.160]  handouts like george norry exactly george good example and uh so you know but you know i think
[01:42:37.160 --> 01:42:41.160]  trump has made this point i'll tell you that's all the levinese christians i see have like big
[01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:45.880]  successful businesses and are building buildings i mean it's kind of a cliche but i haven't found
[01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:49.800]  many levinese people in america levinese christians that aren't really contributing
[01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:56.680]  yeah we're we're employers we're entrepreneurs i i don't know why it works that way but you know
[01:42:56.680 --> 01:43:04.600]  their values are good american values they they you you know i'll give you an example my dad grew
[01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:12.200]  up speaking arabic okay he wouldn't speak arabic in our home i mean i used to beg him to teach me
[01:43:12.200 --> 01:43:17.720]  arab he wouldn't do it because he wanted us to be americans he didn't even want us to think about
[01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:22.600]  the old world and that's kind of the attitude that you have to have if you're a true immigrant
[01:43:22.600 --> 01:43:29.400]  you know these are not immigrants that we're talking about here these are these are invading
[01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:36.120]  forces they they force their way ahead of other people in line people who you know fill out all
[01:43:36.120 --> 01:43:42.280]  the forms to wait uh and and and this is what was now why is this happening alex i've been thinking
[01:43:42.280 --> 01:43:49.160]  about why what why is this happening i'm not talking about why do people want out of their
[01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:57.800]  predicament or want into our country but why is government condoning why are they actually
[01:43:57.800 --> 01:44:03.960]  incentivizing it why are they going along with this why are they taking initiatives even before
[01:44:03.960 --> 01:44:10.280]  these invasions started to bring more and more of these folks into the united states and into europe
[01:44:11.160 --> 01:44:17.240]  i think it gets back to one of your themes i think that this is about the empowerment of
[01:44:17.240 --> 01:44:23.640]  government the empowerment of internationalism uh and it is about ultimately it's about the
[01:44:23.640 --> 01:44:30.520]  lessening of liberty everywhere in the united states and europe etc government wants to be in control
[01:44:30.520 --> 01:44:37.320]  so hey what's wrong with bringing in a bunch of folks who you know who are indebted to you
[01:44:37.320 --> 01:44:43.160]  for their very presence here and that is ultimately i think what's at the core of the immigration
[01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:47.880]  problem i hate to say immigration because it's not immigration no it's an invasion and they
[01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:51.000]  won't even call it immigration they call it migrants it'd be like if i showed up at my
[01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:55.880]  neighbor's house and said i'm moving in with you i'm a i'm a migrant we have the video of the screaming
[01:44:55.880 --> 01:45:01.560]  the cussing the a la oct bars the anger uh we have the video of them attacking aid workers
[01:45:02.200 --> 01:45:08.280]  we have the video uh of them posting on facebook a lot of jihad fighters and isa said six months
[01:45:08.280 --> 01:45:14.520]  ago we're going to send 500 000 immigrants in amongst and will be our people what is merkel and
[01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:19.800]  the french and and the us going to do and obama going to do when isis who's already been attacking
[01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:24.760]  europe really starts attacking when they've brought these people in an advertised how will they get
[01:45:24.760 --> 01:45:31.560]  away with that well i think what ultimately it doesn't matter what happened you know this is why
[01:45:31.560 --> 01:45:38.200]  i said you know a long time ago probably on your show that what is obama all about obama is about
[01:45:39.160 --> 01:45:47.240]  instilling and advocating and encouraging chaos domestically internationally it doesn't matter
[01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:52.200]  everything he does is about increasing the potential for chaos yeah they're financing groups
[01:45:52.200 --> 01:45:57.480]  that say kill police i i can't even believe that a socialist would do i mean i know socialists are
[01:45:57.480 --> 01:46:02.760]  bad and but i mean that really is making me think they he really believes all that 60s revolution
[01:46:02.760 --> 01:46:09.480]  stuff right but what what is cast cast is an opportunity for the government to step in and
[01:46:09.480 --> 01:46:15.640]  solve the problem for people right first their their solution is worse than the the problem
[01:46:15.640 --> 01:46:23.160]  always because it means a lessening of liberty it means bigger government uh and all that goes
[01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:28.360]  along with that how do you think it's going for obama and and do you believe the reports there's
[01:46:28.360 --> 01:46:34.760]  a split between the obamas and the clintons your take on election 2016 the persecution of the press
[01:46:34.760 --> 01:46:39.960]  you've been enjoying the persecution of the clintons you were their first target could we see
[01:46:39.960 --> 01:46:45.160]  the end of the clintons or what do you think's going on i think you know i think healer we've got a real
[01:46:45.160 --> 01:46:50.680]  problem i i have said all along i don't think she's going to get the nomination i didn't think so
[01:46:50.680 --> 01:46:59.160]  before the email thing even started i i have a few friendly wagers in place on that um and you
[01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:06.760]  know i i think she's got two problems she's got herself and she's a lousy salesman for what she
[01:47:06.760 --> 01:47:13.240]  believes in and for herself let's face it you know she she was the heir apparent uh you know back in
[01:47:13.240 --> 01:47:19.240]  the 2008 she didn't she didn't make it uh when she had everything going for her i don't think she's
[01:47:19.240 --> 01:47:24.600]  going to make it this time she's got two problems she's got herself and she's got for rock obama i
[01:47:24.600 --> 01:47:31.800]  don't believe that he that she would be his preference for sure so what do you think about
[01:47:31.800 --> 01:47:36.920]  biden what i mean what do you think's happening with this election well you know i i don't have
[01:47:36.920 --> 01:47:42.120]  a crystal ball i don't know whether biden's going to run or not i suspect he is going to wind up being
[01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:49.640]  uh you know coaxed into the ring you know he he gave an interview last night where he sounded
[01:47:49.640 --> 01:47:56.200]  really ambivalent at best but maybe that's a game he's playing of course if there's going to be a
[01:47:56.200 --> 01:48:02.520]  savior for you know obama ism in this race it's he's got to be identified quickly it's got to get
[01:48:02.520 --> 01:48:10.120]  into the race i think biden's probably their choice and you know sure aside from what he's
[01:48:10.120 --> 01:48:15.240]  going through emotionally about his son i think ultimately he's going to do what obama asks him
[01:48:15.240 --> 01:48:20.200]  sure what's your gut on trump i mean he's a guy who loves hillary clinton i like what he's saying
[01:48:20.200 --> 01:48:23.960]  but then he flip flops and we got to take all these refugees then he flip flopped back
[01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:28.200]  i mean what's your and i need a lot of sources in dc as well you're based up there what's the word
[01:48:28.200 --> 01:48:37.960]  on trump well i don't pay any attention to what dc so first thing first my own eyes can see and
[01:48:37.960 --> 01:48:43.560]  here's the thing that i think is very encouraging about trump whether he stays in the race whether
[01:48:43.560 --> 01:48:52.120]  he wins you know he he probably certainly wouldn't be the guy i would pick to to uh to turn america
[01:48:52.120 --> 01:48:59.800]  around but he's there and he's saying a lot of good things and i think you agree and so great
[01:48:59.800 --> 01:49:07.720]  about trump is that whatever he talks about whatever issues he raises they cannot be ignored
[01:49:07.720 --> 01:49:13.320]  donald trump cannot be ignored the news agencies have tried to do it but it's only to their own
[01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:19.880]  detriment if they don't cover what trump says and does and so this is a this is a factor i don't
[01:49:19.880 --> 01:49:26.280]  think anybody of any of us expected to happen if you go back six months ago they attacked
[01:49:26.280 --> 01:49:31.480]  him and it blew up in their face the mainstream media is so hated that they crowned him when they
[01:49:31.480 --> 01:49:37.240]  attacked him right and we can go we can pick an ideal candidate who agrees with everything we
[01:49:37.240 --> 01:49:44.200]  believe in uh right alex but we can't get them elected well i don't think trump wants to destroy
[01:49:44.200 --> 01:49:50.280]  america like obama does do you think obama will go quietly what's your overall feel for the
[01:49:50.280 --> 01:49:56.200]  country we're about to go to break but in 60 seconds uh yeah obama is not going to go quietly
[01:49:56.200 --> 01:50:03.320]  he's going to have a stay in this race i hillary clinton is not his say i think that that divide is
[01:50:03.320 --> 01:50:09.480]  is very real it's unmistakable uh he can decide it of course with the fbi investigation that he
[01:50:09.480 --> 01:50:15.320]  keeps expanding into all of hillary's problems with the email thing you know that's a real thing
[01:50:15.320 --> 01:50:20.920]  i mean if you and i did something like that alex we'd already be in jail there wouldn't be some
[01:50:20.920 --> 01:50:27.080]  fbi investigation we'd be you know they throw us in jail and they throw away the key and so
[01:50:27.720 --> 01:50:33.080]  that that is real and it's in obama's power what happens with hillary and i think she knows that
[01:50:33.080 --> 01:50:40.280]  uh she's already starting to be it gives signals of criticism toward obama so i think obama is
[01:50:40.280 --> 01:50:45.800]  going to have to say uh but i don't think they can field anybody on the democratic side they could
[01:50:45.800 --> 01:50:52.840]  stop donald trump wow so let's talk about a president trump on the other side even if he was
[01:50:52.840 --> 01:50:57.720]  one of their operatives before these folks will certainly not sell themselves out he might want
[01:50:57.720 --> 01:51:04.520]  to be president okay open your mouth and say ah ah when your child has a sore throat you need to

[01:54:14.280 --> 01:54:21.400]  want to ask but the six minutes we've got left looking at this clearly they're flooding the
[01:54:21.400 --> 01:54:27.640]  united states in europe with the cheap labor as a political checkmate and to basically get a new
[01:54:27.640 --> 01:54:32.200]  dependent class in here because they realize politically people are waking up there's a new
[01:54:32.200 --> 01:54:38.440]  gallop pullout two-thirds of hispanics don't want more immigrants and don't want to expand immigration
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:43.240]  so that whole narrative that hispanics all on open borders it's racist if you don't we've always
[01:54:43.240 --> 01:54:48.920]  known that's bull but it's coming out and just the instincts for national survival i think will
[01:54:48.920 --> 01:54:55.880]  trump pun intended a lot of their actions but um what curveballs do you see them throwing what are
[01:54:55.880 --> 01:55:02.440]  you most concerned with the class warfare the the attack on the family the injection of trannies
[01:55:02.440 --> 01:55:09.480]  everywhere uh men's barbershops getting fined for not having women i mean it's becoming so crazy i
[01:55:09.480 --> 01:55:15.320]  can't even believe it you're right and and it's more than the cheap labor thing ultimately i think
[01:55:15.320 --> 01:55:21.880]  for instance let's let's narrow it down to this invasion why would this be a good thing for people
[01:55:21.880 --> 01:55:28.040]  who want bigger more powerful government less individual sovereignty because you want to have
[01:55:28.040 --> 01:55:35.240]  people who are not even capable of self-government themselves okay you know that's that's what the
[01:55:35.240 --> 01:55:40.200]  founders had in mind for this country was the idea that you know we basically govern ourselves and
[01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:45.800]  and and government would be strictly limited in its powers and of course we've drifted so far from
[01:55:45.800 --> 01:55:52.280]  that over over such a long period of time but now it's on hyperdrive and i think ultimately it's much
[01:55:52.280 --> 01:55:57.720]  more than the cheap labor thing sure you government can sell that the big big businesses you know you
[01:55:57.720 --> 01:56:02.440]  want cheap labor this is good for you go along with the chamber of commerce but i don't think this
[01:56:02.440 --> 01:56:08.600]  starts with the business sector i think it starts with government which is interested in always
[01:56:08.600 --> 01:56:15.720]  expanding its power at the expense of individual liberty and and what better way than to have a
[01:56:15.720 --> 01:56:21.720]  bunch of sheep coming into your country people who are just happy to get any work that they can
[01:56:22.920 --> 01:56:30.360]  and who are not really interested or probably capable of functioning as a self-governing people
[01:56:30.360 --> 01:56:35.320]  under the parameters of our constitution that's that's what i think it's all about
[01:56:35.320 --> 01:56:41.880]  i agree with you in closing i want to get you back in the next few months to get into those
[01:56:41.880 --> 01:56:46.200]  documents you got you said some of it was so incendiary you had to carefully dole it out when
[01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:50.440]  are we going to learn more about what you got from the clinton library i mean what you released
[01:56:50.440 --> 01:56:55.560]  was bombshell yeah well it's there's a lot of good stuff in there but you know when i look at it
[01:56:55.560 --> 01:57:01.960]  i think this means something to me because i experienced it you know how much can i put out
[01:57:01.960 --> 01:57:06.600]  there without people thinking i'm just being self-indulgent and just being this but it doesn't
[01:57:06.600 --> 01:57:10.600]  matter this is how they plan to shut down new media and how they try i mean it's it's really
[01:57:10.600 --> 01:57:17.560]  powerful they they thought i'm shutting down new media even before we got started alex that's
[01:57:17.560 --> 01:57:23.400]  that they saw it i have to hand it to them they saw what a threat uh you know we were at such an
[01:57:23.400 --> 01:57:31.000]  early stage in the development of new media and so now you know now with guys like you and and right
[01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:36.360]  part of drudge and the rest they really got their hands full and they'll be more serious than ever
[01:57:36.360 --> 01:57:41.240]  but look we've experienced it all with obama already let's face it i mean i i don't think
[01:57:41.240 --> 01:57:48.520]  that clinton's have any uh tricks that obama doesn't have uh he has done things that i don't think
[01:57:48.520 --> 01:57:53.640]  hillary could have gotten gotten away with bill could have gotten away with uh he has subverted
[01:57:53.640 --> 01:57:58.440]  the constitution beyond my wildest you think he's gonna try something to stay in office or
[01:57:58.440 --> 01:58:04.200]  sail off of the sunset no i think he wants to pick a successor you know for he's also a genuinely
[01:58:04.200 --> 01:58:09.240]  lazy person i don't think he likes being president there's all the trappings that come with it all
[01:58:09.240 --> 01:58:15.640]  the vacations and perks he liked but you know i mean i think he said his attitude is i did my time
[01:58:15.640 --> 01:58:21.320]  down it's my turn to get rich look for barack obama to you know in a year or two you'll see
[01:58:21.320 --> 01:58:27.880]  him sitting on a huge fortune ask yourselves how that happens it happens every single time these

[02:00:24.040 --> 02:00:28.760]  master chuck bald ones written some really powerful editorials as of late in fact i
[02:00:28.760 --> 02:00:33.640]  forgot to print off his last four or five you guys do that thanks dealing with the death of
[02:00:33.640 --> 02:00:41.000]  religious freedom in this country but it's beyond that the new rite of passage you know for a
[02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:44.760]  comanche a young man had to go out and steal horses and then after that it'd be go out and kill
[02:00:44.760 --> 02:00:51.320]  an enemy in battle count kube for a young american to be joined the marine corps but for women now
[02:00:51.880 --> 02:00:57.720]  the rite of passage out of four years of university is that men are the devil all sex is rape
[02:00:58.920 --> 02:01:05.320]  and that you've got to go out and you've got to report them you got to take a scalp we had the
[02:01:05.320 --> 02:01:11.240]  guest on earlier associated press reported it barbershop finds $750 they were threatened with
[02:01:11.240 --> 02:01:17.560]  10 000 if they didn't pay that and they sent a state investigator at everything i said this is a
[02:01:17.560 --> 02:01:23.480]  men's barbershop of course if he'd let her in and she's seen playboys she might have gone after
[02:01:23.480 --> 02:01:31.320]  that as being you know evil and and hurtful to her and of course under all free association rules
[02:01:31.320 --> 02:01:36.440]  you should be able to have something for men or something for women but i just illustrate how
[02:01:36.440 --> 02:01:41.480]  serious this is you know i mentioned this article feminist claimant sex is to complain

[02:04:04.120 --> 02:04:09.080]  he wrote i appreciate this that this is probably horrendously politically incorrect
[02:04:09.080 --> 02:04:14.680]  but that is a stunning picture oh he even admitted it was politically incorrect he even
[02:04:14.680 --> 02:04:20.840]  prostrated himself before her that i'm so sorry it's politically correct uh incorrect and that
[02:04:20.840 --> 02:04:31.160]  signaled her like a bug-eyed barana to come in and go after him to see they peck members of the cult

[02:04:51.400 --> 02:04:56.600]  her but that's what i would imagine he said hey hussy it's time for us to get together right now

[02:09:03.720 --> 02:09:08.360]  baldwin's been the constitution party national candidate he's been an outspoken critic of tyranny
[02:09:09.480 --> 02:09:14.200]  filmmaker author you name it and his son's constitutional lawyer they've co-written books
[02:09:14.200 --> 02:09:19.720]  together on so many subjects that are near and dear but i was out at dinner with people i would
[02:09:19.720 --> 02:09:25.400]  call quasi liberals a few nights ago and i thought of chuck baldwin and i had a caller bring him up
[02:09:25.400 --> 02:09:29.880]  yesterday about some of the latest articles he's been writing at chuck baldwin live dot com
[02:09:29.880 --> 02:09:35.000]  about the fall of christianity the fall the first amendment that we're seeing and these folks were
[02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:40.600]  saying to me you know you're a conservative we're liberals but we agree with some of your ideas and
[02:09:40.600 --> 02:09:47.080]  things you said and i said listen thomas jefferson was a liberal george washington was a conservative
[02:09:47.080 --> 02:09:52.920]  these terms mean nothing i'm a constitutionalist but they were saying we agree with you marriage
[02:09:52.920 --> 02:09:58.680]  is no point being married now it's been bastardized and i said listen it wasn't bastardized with
[02:09:58.680 --> 02:10:06.760]  homosexual marriage it was bastardized when the state got involved in 1901 in new york city with
[02:10:06.760 --> 02:10:12.280]  marriage licenses to the race hygiene boards they're like oh well let's move on other i said no
[02:10:13.240 --> 02:10:18.200]  don't you want to know where this really came from francis gallton eugenics funded by the crown
[02:10:18.200 --> 02:10:25.400]  on 1854 becomes national policy by the 1880s london sets up the first health boards they
[02:10:25.400 --> 02:10:29.880]  start sterilizing people with low test scores and the mentally retarded and others you can
[02:10:29.880 --> 02:10:35.240]  argue there was a reason for it but it moved on to everybody margaret sanger planned parenthood
[02:10:35.240 --> 02:10:45.560]  the nazis all of it you shouldn't have a marriage license to begin with the church is and they
[02:10:45.560 --> 02:10:52.520]  owned it that's where the institution came from congress shall make no law respecting the establishment
[02:10:52.520 --> 02:10:58.520]  of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or freedom of the press or of the people's
[02:10:58.520 --> 02:11:03.320]  right to peaceably assemble for redress of grievances they're like oh i guess the first
[02:11:03.320 --> 02:11:08.920]  amendment does get into religion yeah congress doesn't have a jurisdiction so we don't have
[02:11:08.920 --> 02:11:15.080]  a state-run religion we don't have government in religion we have individual freedom that's
[02:11:15.080 --> 02:11:21.320]  true freedom for you to not believe in god or to believe in god but marriage is a contract
[02:11:21.320 --> 02:11:26.200]  between a man and a woman and then if they choose to go do that through their religious group they
[02:11:26.200 --> 02:11:31.880]  can have it certified and then by the 50s we get 501c3 and i'm not judging your church if they are
[02:11:31.880 --> 02:11:39.240]  but you're not a church you are a governmental body you are issued license as a charity and now
[02:11:39.240 --> 02:11:47.400]  look they have an issue but one in six years to any conservative group the 501c3 four and the rest of
[02:11:47.400 --> 02:11:54.120]  it the power to control some things the power to end it so now we've got the jurisdiction over
[02:11:54.120 --> 02:11:59.240]  language don't say boy or girl don't say he or she and they're doing it it was hundreds of public
[02:11:59.240 --> 02:12:07.080]  schools a month ago now it's thousands and people are going to the principal for in their forms they
[02:12:07.080 --> 02:12:16.360]  fill out saying he or she this is a cult they mean business they're not liberals they had to take over
[02:12:16.360 --> 02:12:24.040]  the liberal renaissance movement and the christian movements of egalitarianism that were expanding
[02:12:24.040 --> 02:12:31.240]  500 years ago beginning 500 years ago and in their greatest flower by 1776 they then had a counterfeit
[02:12:31.240 --> 02:12:37.480]  of it that is modern liberalism that was the french revolution jacobanism and the illuminati
[02:12:37.480 --> 02:12:42.200]  which were all at that towards washington wrote about this this was like major newspapers of
[02:12:42.200 --> 02:12:47.480]  the time you can just search newspaper articles about illuminati 1789 or towards washington letters
[02:12:47.480 --> 02:12:54.360]  on the illuminati library of congress you'll you can read it all in his handwriting so i talk about
[02:12:54.360 --> 02:13:00.120]  this this isn't some national treasure fiction folks this is the reality and the jacobans the
[02:13:00.120 --> 02:13:06.840]  illuminati wanted to end the family they wanted to end language and turn the general public into
[02:13:06.840 --> 02:13:13.240]  slaves that lived in pits with the high priests above them controlling them with a nine day a week
[02:13:13.240 --> 02:13:19.080]  work week new holidays they wanted to invert everything play god and that's what you're seeing
[02:13:19.080 --> 02:13:25.560]  now is being stomped on being trampled being dominated anything wholesome under attack that's
[02:13:25.560 --> 02:13:33.160]  my rant and and pastor chuck Baldwin talks about this all day it's christianity that ended slavery
[02:13:33.160 --> 02:13:38.840]  real christians it's christianity that gave us the free market it's christianity that gave us
[02:13:38.840 --> 02:13:44.360]  due process it's christianity they say get rid of what's old they're bringing in the old barbarism
[02:13:44.360 --> 02:13:50.360]  of the occult and of a dumbed-down public controlled by the high priest who tells you give him your
[02:13:50.360 --> 02:13:55.400]  kids to sacrifice or your daughters to have sex with or the snake god won't vomit out the moon
[02:13:55.400 --> 02:14:02.680]  at the next eclipse the age of reason begins with christians not the phony churches that our
[02:14:02.680 --> 02:14:11.240]  government state-run churches like china or russia under Stalin now that's my rant chuck Baldwin
[02:14:11.240 --> 02:14:15.880]  joins us he has written the book that we sell roman's 13 the true meaning of submission
[02:14:16.680 --> 02:14:21.640]  but i've heard christians call into conservative radio and say we should submit and issue these
[02:14:21.640 --> 02:14:29.320]  marriage licenses and all the rest of it this is a conquering folks this is a takeover this is
[02:14:29.320 --> 02:14:35.400]  a domination because standing in the way of world government in a microchip population
[02:14:35.400 --> 02:14:40.440]  and a cashless society is the true christians that's why the pope will travel the first time to
[02:14:40.440 --> 02:14:45.960]  cuba to be worshipped by the communist dictator and his brother raul that's why he's coming here
[02:14:45.960 --> 02:14:50.360]  to meet in secret with bainer and then address congress the globalists are making their move
[02:14:50.360 --> 02:14:55.480]  they blackmailed the catholic church this even came out in the guardian to put in the jesuit
[02:14:55.480 --> 02:14:59.800]  pope calling for world government there are a lot of good catholic people i'm not attacking you
[02:14:59.800 --> 02:15:05.960]  the Protestant churches have been taken over as well but it's here it's happening it's happening
[02:15:05.960 --> 02:15:10.920]  and so many christians say praise god it's a sign of the end of the world what a cop out if you
[02:15:10.920 --> 02:15:17.560]  believe in christ standing before christ the white throne judgment would christ say i know you if you
[02:15:17.560 --> 02:15:21.960]  didn't stand up for unborn but here's what i want to tell the funny christians it doesn't matter what
[02:15:21.960 --> 02:15:26.200]  you do at your 501c3 church where you want to feel good and make some business deals
[02:15:27.560 --> 02:15:32.840]  like a Pharisee i'm not judging you god will there are good people infiltrating plant parenthood
[02:15:32.840 --> 02:15:37.560]  there are good people in the pentagon exposing obama funding ices there are people of conscience
[02:15:37.560 --> 02:15:42.600]  who can't submit to tyranny because they've already submitted to god and if you've submitted to god
[02:15:42.600 --> 02:15:47.880]  and i'm certainly not perfect then you there's no way you can submit to open conscious evil chuck
[02:15:47.880 --> 02:15:52.280]  baldwin chuck baldwin live dot com thank you for joining us you've written some powerful
[02:15:52.280 --> 02:15:57.960]  editorials as of late dealing with the situation in this country but uh we've talked about things
[02:15:57.960 --> 02:16:04.680]  compacting and accelerating they are now at light speed and only speeding up what are we
[02:16:04.680 --> 02:16:10.760]  watching right now and i hope folks know historically the judgment once a nation becomes reprobate
[02:16:10.760 --> 02:16:16.920]  always comes as night follows day thank you for joining us chuck baldwin thank you alec great well
[02:16:16.920 --> 02:16:22.200]  appreciate everything you just said there in the opening monologue of this hour i just uh i just
[02:16:22.200 --> 02:16:26.840]  want to kind of reiterate some things that you said uh first of all relative to the marriage issue
[02:16:27.400 --> 02:16:31.960]  you're exactly right when you say that the real problem here and and this is what churches and
[02:16:31.960 --> 02:16:38.920]  christians should be noticing is that years ago toward the middle and the end of the 19th century
[02:16:38.920 --> 02:16:46.840]  as you've already noted the the institution of marriage to use your word was bastardized by
[02:16:46.840 --> 02:16:54.280]  the means of which they placed it under the authority of the state for over 1800 years
[02:16:54.280 --> 02:17:01.080]  of church history the state had nothing to do with marriage the institution of marriage is a
[02:17:01.080 --> 02:17:08.440]  divine marriage is the divine institution this is not a civil contract and this is the thing that
[02:17:08.440 --> 02:17:15.080]  some of our libertarian friends are missing they're applauding the kim davis jailing in kentucky
[02:17:15.080 --> 02:17:20.520]  and they're talking about this being a right of civil contract we all understand that every american
[02:17:20.520 --> 02:17:26.280]  citizen has the right to enter into civil contracts as including homosexuals that's not the issue
[02:17:26.280 --> 02:17:33.480]  marriage is not a civil contract it is a divine institution created by god in the very beginning
[02:17:33.480 --> 02:17:39.800]  of the history of mankind therefore this is not a jurisdiction of the state it never has been
[02:17:39.800 --> 02:17:46.520]  it never should be today but in going into the 20th century when the church sat back and allowed
[02:17:46.520 --> 02:17:55.160]  the state to begin to exercise authority over marriage then it became a civil contract it became
[02:17:55.160 --> 02:18:01.240]  something under the auspices and authority of the state just as the church did in 1954
[02:18:01.240 --> 02:18:07.560]  with the advent of the 501c3 amendment and we're now making the state truly god and then all these
[02:18:07.560 --> 02:18:13.400]  liberals think they're getting rights from the state when it's a total fraud and here's the
[02:18:13.400 --> 02:18:19.800]  thing that makes this kentucky case so interesting because kim davis was actually the one who was
[02:18:19.800 --> 02:18:28.120]  obeying the law now now think about this in 1996 president bill clinton after the congress and the
[02:18:28.120 --> 02:18:33.960]  senate had passed the defense of marriage act doma clinton signed it it became the federal law of
[02:18:33.960 --> 02:18:40.840]  the land that marriage was between a man and a woman okay that was in 1996 signed by a democrat
[02:18:40.840 --> 02:18:47.320]  president bill clinton that was the law of the land nationally all right so now what this decision
[02:18:47.320 --> 02:18:52.840]  was basically doing was reviewing the doma decision and we know what the court did what the court
[02:18:52.840 --> 02:18:58.440]  did is they ruled against doma that was the essence of the of the court's decision so the court's
[02:18:58.440 --> 02:19:04.600]  making law well that's the other part that i that i wanted to get out is the fact that our first
[02:19:04.600 --> 02:19:10.280]  article in the first section all legislative powers here in granite shall be vested in the
[02:19:10.280 --> 02:19:18.600]  congress of the united states the supreme court has no authority to make law it renders opinions
[02:19:18.600 --> 02:19:24.520]  okay so it made an opinion on doma is what this was all about so what happened whenever the supreme
[02:19:24.520 --> 02:19:31.640]  court said that basically doma was unconstitutional well that means there's no federal law relative
[02:19:31.640 --> 02:19:37.880]  to marriage so that means everything reverts back to the states so right now there is what people
[02:19:37.880 --> 02:19:43.640]  are saying that now it's the federal law of the land no what the decision actually did was negate
[02:19:43.640 --> 02:19:50.680]  doma which was the federal law of the land meaning now that there's no federal law relative to marriage
[02:19:50.680 --> 02:19:55.400]  that's right so it does revert to the state stay there this is key and then now they jailed her
[02:19:55.400 --> 02:20:02.760]  i mean this just shows their mindset so i found out the other day that at guns80.com a lot of
[02:20:02.760 --> 02:20:08.760]  people don't get the ghost ar-15 rifle kits because they're afraid that they won't be able to do the

[02:24:08.840 --> 02:24:12.840]  Alex Jones here back live Pastor Chuck Baldwin of chuckbalvinlive.com joins us
[02:24:13.560 --> 02:24:17.880]  of course he sounds a constitutional lawyer works with him there in his operation
[02:24:17.880 --> 02:24:22.200]  but Chuck Baldwin really knows his stuff I've studied this in depth and he knows more than
[02:24:22.200 --> 02:24:25.800]  I do about it but the break kind of stole his thunder he was about to give us the fact that
[02:24:25.800 --> 02:24:31.800]  she was following Kentucky law but even Madonna's brother who is a homosexual and I used to try to
[02:24:31.800 --> 02:24:36.520]  be friendly and say the word gay but it's about controlling language so now they say I can't say
[02:24:36.520 --> 02:24:41.480]  father or mother or boy or girl or he or she so I'm gonna start using the scientific words
[02:24:41.480 --> 02:24:46.760]  because it shows how they get you to start doing what they say and pretty soon everything's banned
[02:24:46.760 --> 02:24:52.440]  pretty soon telling a woman she's attractive is banned pretty soon men's barbershops are banned
[02:24:52.440 --> 02:24:58.600]  pretty soon brown bags are banned this is a cult of fighting with each other and Chuck Baldwin
[02:24:59.800 --> 02:25:06.680]  it really is an attack on humanity itself it's so alien against them the main biology of humans
[02:25:06.680 --> 02:25:12.600]  that men and women loving each other is somehow inherently bad because it hurts someone else
[02:25:12.600 --> 02:25:18.440]  who doesn't feel like that this is outrageous control freak behavior the state and weird creepy
[02:25:18.440 --> 02:25:24.760]  groups trying to insert themselves into our lives our marriages saying our kids belong to the state
[02:25:24.760 --> 02:25:33.960]  creepy msnbc host I mean these people are really villainous sick perverts it's not about freedom
[02:25:33.960 --> 02:25:40.200]  at all it's about tyranny of the mind and and I think that's the battle that's going on today
[02:25:40.200 --> 02:25:45.400]  and you're exactly right him davis was obeying the laws of the state of Kentucky which he swore
[02:25:45.400 --> 02:25:51.240]  an oath to which now become the law of the land because domo was overturned by the supreme court
[02:25:51.240 --> 02:26:01.000]  decision meaning that the the the the constitution that had written that was written established
[02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:08.280]  that the congress only can create law that the supreme court does not make law so by the
[02:26:08.280 --> 02:26:13.240]  negating domo the defense of marriage marriage between a man and a woman and now we verse to
[02:26:13.240 --> 02:26:18.280]  the laws of the states the state of Kentucky had said in the constitution that marriages between a
[02:26:18.280 --> 02:26:23.400]  man and a woman kim davis was upholding her oath what's interesting too is that in the state of
[02:26:23.400 --> 02:26:29.720]  north carolina and the state of utah and in the state of alabama there are county clerks and
[02:26:29.720 --> 02:26:36.920]  courthouses all over those states that are refusing to marry anyone heterosexual or homosexual and by
[02:26:36.920 --> 02:26:42.040]  the way as a minister that's the decision i've taken i have made the decision after the june
[02:26:42.040 --> 02:26:50.120]  decision by the supreme court that i will no longer do a ceremony over any couple homosexual or
[02:26:50.120 --> 02:26:54.840]  heterosexual of course i won't marry homosexuals anyway that have a state license in fact i'm
[02:26:54.840 --> 02:27:01.800]  happy to report alex i just had my first marriage a couple weeks ago without a state license
[02:27:01.800 --> 02:27:08.040]  fortunately here in the state of montana common law marriage is still recognized as lawful
[02:27:08.040 --> 02:27:13.560]  there's only about five or six states unfortunately in the country that still recognize
[02:27:13.560 --> 02:27:17.400]  common law and that's the subject that the i think the listeners of your
[02:27:17.400 --> 02:27:22.760]  program should take note of and they should be appealing to the legislatures to get it on the
[02:27:22.760 --> 02:27:28.520]  books to recognize again common law marriage absolutely because we have to take our power
[02:27:28.520 --> 02:27:34.360]  back or we'll be usurped by the the imposters when i say perverts there aren't just perverts
[02:27:34.360 --> 02:27:39.000]  want to pick kids up in parks there's perverts that want to get in our lives and our families
[02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:43.880]  and tell us what to do this is outrageous why would anyone want to live under something like
[02:27:43.880 --> 02:27:48.920]  this and think about this now with this the supreme court ruling we've got transgender
[02:27:48.920 --> 02:27:55.560]  bathrooms that are being put in just about every school system across america transgender
[02:27:55.560 --> 02:27:59.960]  bath which just shows they're going to teach the kids to do this yeah and think about this too
[02:27:59.960 --> 02:28:03.480]  you know all these people thought well you know she was right to put kim davis in jail because
[02:28:03.480 --> 02:28:09.960]  she violated them think about this 1962 1963 supreme court removed prayer and bible reading
[02:28:09.960 --> 02:28:14.600]  from the public schools of america but what's happening across the united states today
[02:28:14.600 --> 02:28:20.920]  in school district after school district there are prayer rooms that are being put in the public
[02:28:20.920 --> 02:28:26.200]  schools to accommodate the muslim students the muslim students are allowed to leave classes
[02:28:26.200 --> 02:28:33.000]  during school time go to those prayer rooms and conduct their muslim prayers on school property
[02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:39.000]  during school time now where is the you know we're we're that's it why is it selectively enforced
[02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:44.680]  only against christians it's exactly it's because this is an attack against christianity itself
[02:28:44.680 --> 02:28:49.160]  that's why i wrote the column a couple weeks ago talking about the collapse of christianity and
[02:28:49.160 --> 02:28:54.120]  here's the thing that that gets my goat about the whole thing alex is i don't i don't blame the
[02:28:54.120 --> 02:28:58.280]  supreme court and i don't brain blame the liberals and i don't blame the secularists and all these
[02:28:58.280 --> 02:29:04.680]  people that are pushing this agenda i blame the churches the pastors of america they're the ones
[02:29:04.680 --> 02:29:10.520]  that have the power and that and the duty to stand up against this instead they're getting up and
[02:29:10.520 --> 02:29:17.000]  saying roman's 13 because their state run exactly and that goes back to the book that tim and i wrote
[02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:21.800]  about the you know the true meaning of submission roman's 13 because it's just it's right out of
[02:29:21.800 --> 02:29:28.280]  hitler's germany this was the same doctrine that they taught to the churches in germany during the
[02:29:28.280 --> 02:29:33.160]  well hitler has famous quotes about i hate the bible and it's a bunch of you know baloney basically
[02:29:33.160 --> 02:29:38.760]  says it's not it's a fraud but i do like roman's 13 stay there we're gonna come back with chuck
[02:29:38.760 --> 02:29:45.080]  ball and break down the hitlerian roman's 13 out of context which flies in the face of the entire
[02:29:45.080 --> 02:29:51.160]  bibles the christians are supposed to submit to any order we're on the march the empires on the run

[02:33:14.360 --> 02:33:24.360]  race you're listening to the alexander
[02:33:24.360 --> 02:33:29.480]  law that sounded this republic said that the state was not god
[02:33:31.640 --> 02:33:36.280]  even some of the people that weren't true christians who were founding fathers most of
[02:33:36.280 --> 02:33:41.720]  more christian agreed to all this because they understood that the state then wouldn't be god
[02:33:41.720 --> 02:33:46.840]  they could set themselves up as god and that's what all the foolish liberals ought to get is
[02:33:46.840 --> 02:33:51.800]  that god wants to give us free will true christianity gives you the right of choice so in america
[02:33:51.800 --> 02:33:58.440]  you got the right to exercise free will at a level never before seen as long as you didn't
[02:33:58.440 --> 02:34:06.440]  force it on somebody else now we're seeing tyranny and we're seeing what occultism does it seeks to

[02:34:13.480 --> 02:34:18.440]  you can't have fathers and mothers because that hurts somebody else you can't have wealth because
[02:34:18.440 --> 02:34:23.960]  that hurts somebody else and then the elites themselves are totally exempt from all the rules
[02:34:23.960 --> 02:34:29.320]  they foist on us past your chuck Baldwin is our guest if you'd like to talk to him about this issue
[02:34:29.320 --> 02:34:35.640]  particularly and where this country is going eight hundred two five nine nine two three one eight hundred
[02:34:35.640 --> 02:34:39.960]  two five nine nine two three one i'm going to plug here for a moment and get back to that but i'm
[02:34:39.960 --> 02:34:46.280]  going to say this first my parents were pretty conservative growing up but also liberal in ways
[02:34:46.280 --> 02:34:50.600]  they were grew up in the sixties were fissily conservative but they were living let live i'd
[02:34:50.600 --> 02:34:59.880]  call libertarians and i'll be honest i don't have a dislike bone in my body against homosexuals they
[02:34:59.880 --> 02:35:04.120]  run the gamut of different types of people and i'm not up here judging people i've got my own
[02:35:04.120 --> 02:35:09.000]  sins in my life things i do that i know isn't the best lifestyle like drinking sometimes or
[02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:17.320]  having anger problems uh stuff like that i mean none of us are perfect but it's the consciousness
[02:35:17.320 --> 02:35:21.320]  of hurting people that's bad it's trying to take free will that's bad and i'll say this
[02:35:23.160 --> 02:35:29.400]  the homosexual movement worldwide is a eugenicist depopulation anti-family movement i've proven it
[02:35:29.400 --> 02:35:34.920]  i've made films on it and they're putting chemicals in the food and water to change the sexuality
[02:35:34.920 --> 02:35:41.640]  of people that's declassified we're being messed with and now as people are changed and as things
[02:35:41.640 --> 02:35:45.800]  become different and some people you can say we're naturally that way some people genetic whatever
[02:35:45.800 --> 02:35:51.240]  this stuff's always gone on history what i'm getting at is just as Sodom and Gomorrah whether
[02:35:51.240 --> 02:35:56.280]  you believe that old testament story or not it says they were coming to people's houses saying
[02:35:56.280 --> 02:36:02.520]  we're going to force sex on you you're going to do what we want that's where this is basically come
[02:36:03.160 --> 02:36:09.880]  and the homosexual activist corvindale said all sex was about power and he made movies with trannies
[02:36:09.880 --> 02:36:17.800]  raping men now i'm not judging gore vidal the point is is that section my life is not about
[02:36:17.800 --> 02:36:25.240]  dominating somebody and so you got some really screwed up people leading these movements and
[02:36:25.240 --> 02:36:31.480]  the whole homosexual movement at the top is about taking over society is about recruiting children
[02:36:31.480 --> 02:36:37.800]  is about dominating and controlling and i'm not here to be dominated i'm not here to be controlled
[02:36:37.800 --> 02:36:45.160]  i'm tolerant but i'm not here to be enslaved and again even Madonna's brother has come out
[02:36:45.160 --> 02:36:49.400]  and agreed and said that's the case and he said why can the Muslims do whatever they want and why
[02:36:49.400 --> 02:36:54.760]  do we have to adopt what they say but then very open-minded Christians we say are the enemy and
[02:36:54.760 --> 02:37:02.760]  he is a homosexual but see he's not a tyrant and so i know tyranny when i see it and this is textbook
[02:37:02.760 --> 02:37:07.160]  tyranny so we'll get Chuck Baldwin's take on that and more and take your phone calls this tv that
[02:37:07.160 --> 02:37:11.240]  usually has the calls on it's dead guys we can fire that back up the toll-free number to join
[02:37:11.240 --> 02:37:23.320]  this is 800 259 92 31 800 259 92 31 i mean making transgender bathrooms is about starting the
[02:37:23.320 --> 02:37:28.440]  conversation getting kids into it having it in books and nudging them into that lifestyle
[02:37:30.360 --> 02:37:35.080]  it's psychological warfare just like when they started death education in 1990 within three
[02:37:35.080 --> 02:37:41.240]  years every school that did it had a tripling in suicides even 2020 abc news did a special on it
[02:37:41.240 --> 02:37:46.920]  i covered it at the time in 95 when they actually had the piece about what happened in the years
[02:37:46.920 --> 02:37:52.840]  after it was adopted it taught the kids how to commit suicide the dare program teaches you how
[02:37:52.840 --> 02:37:59.720]  to use drugs and the truth is five year olds aren't thinking they're a girl six year olds aren't
[02:37:59.720 --> 02:38:07.320]  learning normally about oral sex that's what's taught now and it's sick it's teachers at a school
[02:38:07.320 --> 02:38:11.560]  with a curriculum not just telling your kids what to eat and that parents can't pack lunches now all
[02:38:11.560 --> 02:38:15.240]  of the country and that you can't have dodgeball or whatever because it's competitive and hateful
[02:38:15.880 --> 02:38:22.520]  but that you know bobby has two daddies or heather has two mommies i mean this is being forced
[02:38:22.520 --> 02:38:29.880]  with people sexualizing our children and it's pedophilia now briefly we have struck the best

[02:40:44.520 --> 02:40:49.560]  we're being conquered by obviously it's the devil but my faith has always been strong but now it's
[02:40:49.560 --> 02:40:56.600]  so strong chuck because you can see this isn't of this world i describe it if i was a science fiction
[02:40:56.600 --> 02:41:03.480]  writer of how an alien force would infiltrate and end a species you end the family you confuse the
[02:41:03.480 --> 02:41:08.760]  sexuality i mean texas a and m has helped come up with stuff to eradicate the fire ant eradicate
[02:41:10.760 --> 02:41:13.320]  you know different types of maggots that get into beef
[02:41:15.960 --> 02:41:21.880]  by attacking their sexuality with pheromones with chemicals that confuse the sexes this is how
[02:41:21.880 --> 02:41:26.760]  if i was aliens i'd take out the planet you look at what the globalists are doing it is a takedown
[02:41:26.760 --> 02:41:33.000]  of humanity how can the idiot obama supporters not get that they're that their healthcare prices
[02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:37.800]  have gone up how can they not get that black unemployment's doubled how can they not get
[02:41:37.800 --> 02:41:44.840]  they're being preyed upon by he that comes to kill steal and destroy well and how can the pastors
[02:41:44.840 --> 02:41:52.760]  in churches not get that they their obedience and submission is due to christ not the state not
[02:41:52.760 --> 02:42:00.120]  Caesar i think a lot of our pastors in churches today are are saying in essence what the Pharisees
[02:42:00.120 --> 02:42:05.400]  said 2 000 years ago and they said we have no king but Caesar and that's exactly the way they're
[02:42:05.400 --> 02:42:13.080]  acting because of the 501c3 issue they're scared to death that they might lose their tax exempt
[02:42:13.080 --> 02:42:19.560]  status and therefore they're afraid to deal with any of the issues that are confronting their their
[02:42:19.560 --> 02:42:26.200]  churches and their communities which has basically neutered the churches of the pastors they've become
[02:42:26.200 --> 02:42:32.840]  completely mute on these issues think about it now it's we've got over 300 000 evangelical churches
[02:42:32.840 --> 02:42:38.920]  in america today think what would happen if just half of them or a quarter of them would
[02:42:38.920 --> 02:42:43.800]  stand up in their pulpits and strongly take a stand on these issues think about what would
[02:42:43.800 --> 02:42:48.680]  have happened in Kentucky if the pastors in churches that have stood up that situation there
[02:42:48.680 --> 02:42:54.760]  would have never taken place this is being done because of the lack of courage and involvement
[02:42:54.760 --> 02:43:00.120]  of the pastors in churches in america we have no one to blame but but us and the reason for this
[02:43:00.120 --> 02:43:06.200]  it's largely the roman's 13 misinterpretation this thing has been propagandized for the last
[02:43:06.200 --> 02:43:12.600]  75 to 100 years to the point that it's now a part of the psyche of the christian community they don't
[02:43:12.600 --> 02:43:17.640]  even think about it they just accept it carte blanche and this is one of the most perverse
[02:43:17.640 --> 02:43:22.680]  teachings of scripture that i don't want to think about the whole bible is people not submitting the
[02:43:22.680 --> 02:43:29.640]  tyranny i mean if you took out every example of the bible of people men and women who deliberately
[02:43:29.640 --> 02:43:38.440]  disobeyed the higher power the civil government based upon a moral of conviction under god
[02:43:38.440 --> 02:43:43.880]  you would get rid of martin luther king and rosa parks the book of daniel entire book of
[02:43:43.880 --> 02:43:49.640]  judges you go through the the book of acts go through the old testament time after time you
[02:43:49.640 --> 02:43:57.640]  see disobedient willful disobedience to government because there is a higher law than the civil law
[02:43:57.640 --> 02:44:01.800]  there is a moral law i mean that's what nuremberg was all about at the end of world war two
[02:44:01.800 --> 02:44:06.200]  you know the nazi leaders tried to justify their action and said look we were just obeying orders
[02:44:06.200 --> 02:44:10.760]  we shouldn't be held accountable for the atrocities we committed we're just obeying orders and of
[02:44:10.760 --> 02:44:16.040]  course the nuremberg judges said no there is a moral law that's higher than the laws of men
[02:44:16.040 --> 02:44:21.800]  and that's true it's true for all ages all times all people all nations it's true in our country
[02:44:21.800 --> 02:44:27.080]  today so why are the churches and the pastors teaching their people to become good little
[02:44:27.080 --> 02:44:32.600]  servants good little slaves of the because they're not churches well they have become
[02:44:32.600 --> 02:44:39.800]  government corporations and the pastors are ceo's and the deacons and the trustees are corporate
[02:44:39.800 --> 02:44:47.800]  officers they truly are when they signed the bottom line and they joined voluntarily that 501c3
[02:44:48.360 --> 02:44:55.000]  a status of the irs they became a government corporation and the officers became government
[02:44:55.000 --> 02:45:01.160]  officers it's corporate officers so therefore they're acting in accordance with that they're
[02:45:01.160 --> 02:45:05.800]  not prophets they're not watchmen on the wall they're not speaking they're not power of ear they are
[02:45:05.800 --> 02:45:12.760]  state run exactly this they are state run they're their state control and they know it and that's
[02:45:12.760 --> 02:45:17.480]  the thing about it is that the third rail out there it's an invisible rail but they know it's
[02:45:17.480 --> 02:45:23.800]  there and they refuse to touch it for fearing that the influential members of the of the congregation
[02:45:23.800 --> 02:45:27.640]  of the people that are giving a lot of money well they might not be inspired to give if there's a
[02:45:27.640 --> 02:45:31.560]  threat to the five you know to the nonprofits and let me throw this in there pastor because i want
[02:45:31.560 --> 02:45:36.840]  your expert take on this the last six months you could see the hammer dropped by the collectivist
[02:45:36.840 --> 02:45:42.920]  the takeover is on and suddenly i got some family that goes to methodist churches and and kind of
[02:45:42.920 --> 02:45:47.880]  baptist churches and stuff and i go to some of them man it's like here in moussey tongue or something
[02:45:47.880 --> 02:45:53.640]  the new pope openly calling world government saying abortion's okay i mean it is on they are
[02:45:53.640 --> 02:45:58.920]  really showing their hand why do you think that's happening well i think it's happening because it's
[02:45:58.920 --> 02:46:04.440]  it's the it's now the politically correct thing to do and unfortunately the the the thing that's
[02:46:04.440 --> 02:46:11.240]  motivating most of these church leaders is success quote unquote and i'm taking that word not because
[02:46:11.240 --> 02:46:16.520]  that's what i'm saying but because of george barnes research a few months ago documented this
[02:46:16.520 --> 02:46:23.320]  brilliantly average church leader in america is motivated by success success means bigger crowds
[02:46:23.320 --> 02:46:30.120]  and in the audience bigger offerings more programs more staff members and larger square footage of
[02:46:30.120 --> 02:46:36.600]  building that's what success means according to barnes research in the average church so it's not
[02:46:36.600 --> 02:46:41.160]  about preaching the word it's not about standing for truth it's not about preparing but it's not
[02:46:41.160 --> 02:46:46.440]  success if you've just got some government run social club with a cross hanging on the wall
[02:46:46.440 --> 02:46:52.520]  exactly and in in nazi germany and if you've ever read hitler's cross a tremendous book you see the
[02:46:52.520 --> 02:46:58.520]  photographs of the nazi flags in the auditoriums of the churches of germany and sewn right in the
[02:46:58.520 --> 02:47:04.520]  center of the nazi flag was the christian cross i mean that's how integrated the church had become
[02:47:04.520 --> 02:47:09.960]  to the state you talk about separation of church and state we don't have it we have the state that
[02:47:09.960 --> 02:47:16.280]  is taking over the church the church is nothing but a mouthpiece for the state i know and i talk
[02:47:16.280 --> 02:47:20.760]  to liberals and they go separation church and state that doesn't mean this government runs the
[02:47:20.760 --> 02:47:28.520]  churches and it's just so inverted it's absolutely inverted and and the result is the loss of freedom
[02:47:28.520 --> 02:47:34.280]  not only that we don't understand natural law anymore you can't even get christian pastors
[02:47:34.280 --> 02:47:39.800]  so to give you any kind of an explanation we ask them can you give me just a brief summary of natural
[02:47:39.800 --> 02:47:45.320]  law they can't do it say where is natural law in the bible they can't do it well chuck i was
[02:47:45.320 --> 02:47:50.600]  criticized over the years as a libertarian you know christian for not being more upset about the
[02:47:50.600 --> 02:47:57.160]  homosexual lobby but i've just got to say now you i can really see that it is what people said
[02:47:57.160 --> 02:48:02.360]  i mean it is a takeover and it's just so weird to see weird socialist communists and homosexual
[02:48:02.360 --> 02:48:07.880]  groups allied to bring down christianity with radical islam which would cut their throat in a
[02:48:07.880 --> 02:48:13.080]  minute and the feminist groups have nothing to say about radical islam and all the horrible things
[02:48:13.080 --> 02:48:19.320]  they do these are really just sick evil people that are controlling all of this i mean they really are
[02:48:20.120 --> 02:48:23.960]  at the end of the day they're hunger to attack real christians and to take us over
[02:48:23.960 --> 02:48:27.880]  and our children really shows they're animated by the spirit of the devil
[02:48:28.520 --> 02:48:33.240]  yeah i wonder christian parents are gonna do now i mean look this this term just started up around
[02:48:33.240 --> 02:48:39.560]  the country they're going back to a transgender curriculum in in the in the schools they're
[02:48:39.560 --> 02:48:45.320]  going into transgender bathrooms in the schools i mean where are the christian parents on this
[02:48:45.320 --> 02:48:50.440]  they'll submit only going to allow their kids to be subjected to this five days a week in the public
[02:48:50.440 --> 02:48:57.560]  schools if we should ever be thinking about homeschooling it is now if we should ever but is
[02:48:57.560 --> 02:49:03.240]  it not pedophilia to come in and make education about sex with little kids i mean this is perverted
[02:49:03.240 --> 02:49:08.600]  at one time it would have been considered a crime it would in the united states it would have been
[02:49:08.600 --> 02:49:14.280]  considered a crime contributing to the delinquency of a minor that's exactly what well we always wonder
[02:49:14.280 --> 02:49:18.920]  how namble would get in we know that un wants to legalize it all and these judges have been calling
[02:49:18.920 --> 02:49:24.520]  in europe for legalizing it and uh you know the the the day's coming we're a 20 year old or
[02:49:24.520 --> 02:49:28.200]  50 year old box on your door wants to date your seven-year-old and if you don't do it you'll go
[02:49:28.200 --> 02:49:33.800]  to jail well yeah what what is what's going to be next i mean you know judge roberts predicted
[02:49:33.800 --> 02:49:39.320]  in his dissent to the supreme court decision in june that this was going to sedgeway into
[02:49:39.320 --> 02:49:44.680]  polygamy very quickly where do where do we go from there yeah how do you say no to people
[02:49:44.680 --> 02:49:50.040]  who want to marry five women well and and how do you say no to people that want to marry minors
[02:49:50.040 --> 02:49:57.320]  i mean let's uh we we can see the age of consent that's going to be going down to accommodate people
[02:49:57.320 --> 02:50:01.560]  who want to marry minors yeah because that's their preference i mean you don't want to be

[02:54:34.040 --> 02:54:40.680]  been starting it's just sick how they guilt us the west it's so open-minded into submitting to all
[02:54:40.680 --> 02:54:46.920]  this craziness chuck balvin there is an awakening happening to this and i think the establishment
[02:54:46.920 --> 02:54:50.200]  smoking a lot of its own dump i want to give us some phone calls in this segment the next
[02:54:50.200 --> 02:54:55.320]  there's a whole other hour coming up fourth hour with rob do and others and david knight and
[02:54:55.320 --> 02:55:01.800]  you name it hosting but but but chuck balvin how does the left work with radical islam
[02:55:01.800 --> 02:55:06.920]  that would slit their throat in a minute i guess that just shows the true hate is of christianity
[02:55:06.920 --> 02:55:14.360]  and freedom yeah i don't think there's a question that the secularists in general have a disdain
[02:55:14.360 --> 02:55:20.440]  against christianity and christian principles and i do believe that there is a correlation there and
[02:55:20.440 --> 02:55:28.040]  i think that that the fact that america was founded by christian men largely mostly and
[02:55:28.040 --> 02:55:33.800]  that the the fundamental tenets of our bill of rights and and the principles of our constitution
[02:55:34.360 --> 02:55:41.000]  and especially our declaration of independence are all founded and framed on christian principles
[02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:46.520]  and on biblical principles and natural law principles i think that the men and women who
[02:55:46.520 --> 02:55:54.040]  reject those ideals have a natural propendancy to reject christianity in general because they
[02:55:54.040 --> 02:55:59.400]  know that that's the basis of our liberties and of our freedoms and if you are tyrannical in nature
[02:55:59.400 --> 02:56:04.840]  if you are dictatorial in nature then obviously you have to cut to the root of that which is the
[02:56:04.840 --> 02:56:10.360]  source of liberty and freedom and that of course is the principles of the bible and the principles
[02:56:10.360 --> 02:56:15.800]  of natural law and so i think that there is a natural tendency on the part of the people you're
[02:56:15.800 --> 02:56:19.800]  describing to target christianity i don't think there's any doubt about it it's a complete double
[02:56:19.800 --> 02:56:26.760]  standard because everything that they're denying christians they are readily acquiescing to muslims
[02:56:26.760 --> 02:56:29.800]  here in the united states well that's the thing about political correctness it's all selectively
[02:56:29.800 --> 02:56:35.400]  enforced feminists can have sex with whoever they want objectify men but you can't do it to them
[02:56:35.400 --> 02:56:41.080]  i mean it's just it's just sick and you look how bad a shape women are in now it's just crazy
[02:56:41.080 --> 02:56:45.800]  pete in indiana you want to talk about 9 11 go ahead it is the 14th anniversary i just wanted
[02:56:45.800 --> 02:56:53.000]  to comment 9 11 is now commemorated as patriot's day and the irony of that is that since 9 11 and
[02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:58.600]  since the wars we've been involved in and since uh our police have been militarized that uh
[02:56:59.320 --> 02:57:04.600]  patriot's day is more like a slap in the face to people who are patriots and exactly patriot's
[02:57:04.600 --> 02:57:09.160]  day is april 19th they now call this the new patriot's day and they talk about those that died but
[02:57:09.160 --> 02:57:13.320]  not about those that died from the dust not the prior knowledge how it's been used to take our
[02:57:13.320 --> 02:57:19.640]  liberties absolutely chuck balton what do you think of 14 years after 9 11 i think that there's
[02:57:19.640 --> 02:57:24.840]  more questions unanswered than there are answered i mean i you know when i was traveling around 2008
[02:57:24.840 --> 02:57:29.480]  as a candidate for president of the united states on the constitution party i was asked that question
[02:57:29.480 --> 02:57:36.120]  quite a bit and my standard response was i just like for somebody in authority with some kind of
[02:57:36.120 --> 02:57:43.080]  of documentation and scientific evidence to show me why building seven collapsed i mean we can't
[02:57:43.080 --> 02:57:47.880]  even get a a straight answer from anybody i talked to the deputy emergency manager he said they
[02:57:47.880 --> 02:57:52.600]  blew it up he was dead two weeks after he was on uh pia that's what i'm saying i'm saying nobody in
[02:57:52.600 --> 02:58:00.760]  an official capacity nobody that you know they could have a real part in bringing some solution
[02:58:00.760 --> 02:58:05.480]  to the minds and closure to the minds and the hearts especially the families of these victims has
[02:58:05.480 --> 02:58:11.640]  even come close to providing a closure on any of this including the most simple question about
[02:58:11.640 --> 02:58:15.960]  building seven so i think what we're dealing with 14 years later is the fact that more and more
[02:58:15.960 --> 02:58:20.840]  people are waking up and realizing that the official story just doesn't jive there's more
[02:58:20.840 --> 02:58:26.120]  questions than there are answers and the official story doesn't make sense there's a and now the
[02:58:26.120 --> 02:58:30.200]  former head of defense intelligence and the former deputy had the cia came out and said our government
[02:58:30.200 --> 02:58:35.960]  runs al-qaeda in isis and is protecting them and obama's covering it up with saudi arabia i mean
[02:58:35.960 --> 02:58:41.080]  we got a coup of this country by saudi arabia folks i'm not saying entirely but nobody talks
[02:58:41.080 --> 02:58:45.960]  about them and boy we do let me tell you they don't like it we're gonna be right back stay with us

[03:00:08.440 --> 03:00:11.640]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network

[03:00:20.360 --> 03:00:29.640]  ahead respect it for a long time and i don't know if either you understand what the actual issue is
[03:00:29.640 --> 03:00:35.960]  in this world or if maybe you're just not giving it to the to the people because the truth is the
[03:00:35.960 --> 03:00:39.160]  reason why this has been happening in this country and pretty much all over the west
[03:00:39.960 --> 03:00:44.280]  is because people just don't believe in god anymore and so the truth is that the war
[03:00:44.280 --> 03:00:51.240]  is on god it's a war on god not a war on christianity so you know you're always talking about being
[03:00:51.240 --> 03:00:57.400]  you're not anti islam and islamophobic but the truth is that you either come off as um
[03:00:57.400 --> 03:01:05.320]  ingenious or you're hearing about muslim culture because you know um i converted and i've been to
[03:01:05.320 --> 03:01:10.040]  a muslim country before and i've seen what it actually produces and muslim people are actually
[03:01:10.040 --> 03:01:16.200]  people of faith let me ask you a question can i can i can i preach christianity on the streets of
[03:01:16.200 --> 03:01:23.160]  saudi arabia uh as far as i know not not that i know but he's a huge thing no you can't in fact it's
[03:01:23.160 --> 03:01:29.880]  an executable offense can you teach islam on the streets of california okay you talk about
[03:01:29.880 --> 03:01:34.520]  that you're going to answer my question here's what i don't like i give islam and i know a lot of
[03:01:34.520 --> 03:01:38.760]  muslims are nice people in a lot of ways they're more moral than what we've got here in this country
[03:01:38.760 --> 03:01:43.080]  so i don't judge muslims across the board i try to stop them from being invaded i try to stop them
[03:01:43.080 --> 03:01:47.720]  from being taken over by the globalist and the class of civilizations but the truth is radical
[03:01:47.720 --> 03:01:52.600]  islam is being allowed to take over and being allowed to persecute christians and i'm sick of it
[03:01:52.600 --> 03:01:56.920]  and i'm tired of it and i'm standing up for christians now i want to give chuck ball in a response
[03:01:56.920 --> 03:02:03.000]  to what you said mike i'll let you comment back well he obviously doesn't know me very well and
[03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:07.800]  he hasn't read too much of what i have to say because i'm one that is taking a lot of grief
[03:02:07.800 --> 03:02:15.720]  from the right on my statement that there are many many many peace loving muslim people here
[03:02:15.720 --> 03:02:22.440]  in this country and around the world there are and that our foreign policy our aggressive war doctrine
[03:02:22.440 --> 03:02:28.760]  our preemptive invasions our drone attacks etc this new world order machination that's being
[03:02:28.760 --> 03:02:33.800]  played out in the middle east is doing more to create the radical muslims that you're talking
[03:02:33.800 --> 03:02:41.400]  about we are creating we created isis through our cia of course and yeah and that is to disease
[03:02:41.400 --> 03:02:45.720]  the good islam i guess you're talking about sir so there can be a class of civilizations we have
[03:02:45.720 --> 03:02:51.720]  all the documents so that's what i'm saying so what i'm saying is the gentleman needs to understand
[03:02:51.720 --> 03:02:57.480]  that that my position and i think yours too is we're not talking about muslims in general
[03:02:58.040 --> 03:03:02.760]  and we're not even attack i'm at least i'm not i'm not even attacking the muslim faith per se
[03:03:03.320 --> 03:03:10.920]  but the the radical implementation of islam in this country is a problem and it's created by
[03:03:11.560 --> 03:03:19.960]  a a new world order doctrine which is bent on controlling the entire western world
[03:03:19.960 --> 03:03:27.160]  under one global environment and that includes london and includes saudi arabia it includes the
[03:03:27.160 --> 03:03:33.160]  united states it includes israel and whenever we stop and realize that the that the fallout of
[03:03:33.160 --> 03:03:40.120]  this the blowback to cia term of this is this perpetual war that we see going on and into
[03:03:40.120 --> 03:03:44.760]  and to fight the perpetual war we've got to have a police state erected it's a globally
[03:03:44.760 --> 03:03:48.680]  stabilization great point chuck balvin we're almost out of time i wanted to have mike be able to
[03:03:48.680 --> 03:03:55.000]  counter back uh mike the truth is a lot of muslims want to defend the fact that a lot of islam has
[03:03:55.000 --> 03:03:59.640]  become totalitarian i'm against totalitarianism across the board and the truth is you can't
[03:03:59.640 --> 03:04:04.120]  preach christianity in saudi arabia you can preach islam here so that's what i was saying
[03:04:05.400 --> 03:04:10.360]  you keep talking about saudi arabia saudi arabia has no part of this you make it seem like saudi
[03:04:10.360 --> 03:04:15.720]  arabia pretty much runs islam that's not true because no muslims that i know really believe
[03:04:15.720 --> 03:04:19.800]  that saudi arabia is in control of anybody everybody knows that the saudi are a bunch of
[03:04:19.800 --> 03:04:24.520]  degenerates and they do not run islam they don't represent the muslim community and we see you
[03:04:24.520 --> 03:04:29.480]  always talking about how the saudi's have a hand in ice well so does the west and so does israel
[03:04:29.480 --> 03:04:34.040]  so how all of a sudden the saudi arabia is the perpetrator though they're part of it definitely
[03:04:34.040 --> 03:04:38.840]  and the muslim people well sir i mean you say that we don't have a war on god here and you say that
[03:04:38.840 --> 03:04:42.280]  we don't expose other people involved i've been doing that the whole show today so you

[03:05:07.240 --> 03:05:12.680]  on earth we ever got in this situation well i'll tell you how when the democrats showed

[03:08:38.280 --> 03:08:44.120]  to play some 9 11 videos we're going to have a guest on at the bottom of the hour who actually
[03:08:44.120 --> 03:08:52.360]  refuse a tv guy in britain and he refused to pay his bbc license back in 2013 because of the bbc's
[03:08:52.360 --> 03:08:57.000]  presentation and it's a video i'm going to show you in just a second and he says they had fore
[03:08:57.000 --> 03:09:01.640]  knowledge of what was going on in 9 11 therefore they're part of a terrorist organization so he
[03:09:01.640 --> 03:09:08.040]  went to court fought against it now he's working on a film about the subject and 9 11's affected
[03:09:08.040 --> 03:09:12.280]  everybody i mean there's not one person in this world who hasn't been affected by it if you're on
[03:09:12.280 --> 03:09:16.280]  the side of the terrorists you were definitely affected by it because we invaded the countries
[03:09:16.280 --> 03:09:21.800]  that actually didn't attack us and so you're probably actually scott free if you're inside
[03:09:21.800 --> 03:09:26.680]  arabia now we've got the 28 pages we're going to talk about a little bit i'm going to play a report
[03:09:26.680 --> 03:09:33.880]  that darryl mcbreen put together in our short five minute segment coming up next but and i'm also
[03:09:33.880 --> 03:09:39.720]  going to cover an interview we did last night with a family who is in nevada they have a mine
[03:09:39.720 --> 03:09:45.400]  there and a family mine they've had since the 1870s i think ulysses s grant is on the deed he signed it
[03:09:46.040 --> 03:09:50.920]  over to them and they have been harassed by the government who want this land they want this 400
[03:09:50.920 --> 03:09:56.120]  acres and there's the headline right there shocking area 51 family describes bombing machine gun
[03:09:56.120 --> 03:10:00.440]  attacks that's 50 caliber machine gun attacks and nuclear testing done by the feds and take a look at
[03:10:00.440 --> 03:10:05.320]  this picture right here this is what they sent me this morning this is actually a picture that they
[03:10:05.320 --> 03:10:12.440]  took uh from their um from their house and this is a nuclear blast right here there's the cat that's
[03:10:12.440 --> 03:10:18.920]  the family cat checking it out and they're the family members of the sheen family this was 20 miles
[03:10:18.920 --> 03:10:22.760]  from their house this is what the american government thought of these people they thought
[03:10:22.760 --> 03:10:29.480]  they could open air test nuclear bombs 20 miles from their house now you tell me that is not ludicrous
[03:10:29.480 --> 03:10:36.120]  and if if a government is going to do that test nuclear bombs next to families and and homesteads
[03:10:37.000 --> 03:10:40.680]  what makes you think they won't kill three to four thousand of their own citizens to
[03:10:40.680 --> 03:10:48.200]  further their agenda which is consolidate consolidate consolidate um so let's actually
[03:10:48.200 --> 03:10:53.960]  let's go to that bbc video right now and this is uh what what tony rook who's going to be my
[03:10:53.960 --> 03:10:58.200]  guest at the bottom of the air this is what he was so pissed off about that they would have the
[03:10:58.200 --> 03:11:02.120]  gall to talk about a building that collapsed when it's actually standing right behind the
[03:11:02.120 --> 03:11:06.520]  reporter so let's go to that video moments ago i was talking about the salomon brothers building
[03:11:06.520 --> 03:11:11.560]  collapsing and indeed it has apparently that's only a few hundred yards away from where the
[03:11:11.560 --> 03:11:17.560]  world trade center towers were and it seems that this was not a result of a new attack it was because
[03:11:17.560 --> 03:11:23.080]  the building had been weakened during this morning's attacks we'll probably find out more now about
[03:11:23.080 --> 03:11:28.760]  that from our correspondent jane stanley jane what more can you tell us about the salomon brothers
[03:11:28.760 --> 03:11:34.920]  building this collapse well only really watch your heads blocking it right now you can see the
[03:11:34.920 --> 03:11:41.880]  corner of world trade center seven town in new york behind me down by the world trade centers of
[03:11:41.880 --> 03:11:48.120]  just an area completely closed off as the rescue workers try to do their job but this isn't the
[03:11:48.120 --> 03:11:54.520]  first building that has suffered as a result we know that part of the marriott hotel next to the
[03:11:54.520 --> 03:11:59.400]  world trade center also the building is still on fire behind her smoking and you can see the
[03:11:59.400 --> 03:12:05.480]  corner of it behind jane's head floors of two the two twin towers of the world trade center
[03:12:05.480 --> 03:12:13.000]  as you can see behind there is the trade center is still burning we see these huge clouds of smoke
[03:12:13.000 --> 03:12:19.640]  and ash and we know that behind that there's an empty piece of what was a very familiar new
[03:12:19.640 --> 03:12:27.160]  york skyline a symbol of the financial prosperity of this city but so completely so there you go
[03:12:27.160 --> 03:12:31.960]  that we're going to have uh the story behind that and the the filmmaker who is so mad he
[03:12:31.960 --> 03:12:38.040]  didn't want to pay his bbc license they call bbc auntie up in or over across the pond in england
[03:12:38.040 --> 03:12:44.120]  but let's get to some 9 11 stuff that may happen today on 9 11 this is from biz pack review cops on
[03:12:44.120 --> 03:12:50.920]  high alert for black lives matter violence targeting 9 11 events uh some members of the black lives
[03:12:50.920 --> 03:12:57.720]  matter and f uk yo flag movements are organizing and calling for the murder of more police officers
[03:12:57.720 --> 03:13:02.520]  as is from the daily caller and they have a uh interesting scroll down a little bit guys and
[03:13:02.520 --> 03:13:07.720]  you could show them the the flyer right there we are free of your lives your world is ended
[03:13:07.720 --> 03:13:13.320]  we will continue without you on 9 11 we reveal the truth that will change everything together we
[03:13:13.320 --> 03:13:20.280]  are the future featuring black writers liberation party black supremacy and black radicals i guess
[03:13:20.280 --> 03:13:26.600]  of america so they are planning on uh doing some events at stone mountain which they claim
[03:13:26.600 --> 03:13:33.800]  is a racist site uh even though it's a mountain and people go there and hang out and uh families go
[03:13:33.800 --> 03:13:39.080]  there so we'll see what happens a daily caller also picked up on this black lives matter attacks on
[03:13:39.080 --> 03:13:46.680]  9 11 uh be on the lookout alerts from several law enforcement agencies are saying that black lives
[03:13:46.680 --> 03:13:53.000]  matter and f y f 9 11 are calling for the murder of police officers and uh there's even if you go back
[03:13:53.000 --> 03:13:58.280]  actually to the biz pack review article there's another poster down here that shows i guess what
[03:13:58.280 --> 03:14:03.560]  they're planning on uh scroll down to the bottom of that guys maybe it's real small on this but
[03:14:03.560 --> 03:14:08.040]  you could see there's a there's a clan member hung up and then right next to a police officer so
[03:14:08.040 --> 03:14:13.320]  they're equating the police with the clan even though uh it was that maybe they the democratic
[03:14:13.320 --> 03:14:19.160]  party who actually started the clan and a lot of these guys i bet identify as democrats so
[03:14:19.160 --> 03:14:24.120]  so you've got that if anything happens or if anybody wants to report on anything
[03:14:24.760 --> 03:14:31.640]  having to do with these black lives matter uh 9 11 style attacks you can call in at 800 259

[03:14:51.320 --> 03:14:57.800]  very quickly now i want to go to the uh an excerpt of an interview we did last night with the sheen
[03:14:57.800 --> 03:15:02.360]  family they got they were just done fox news and then they called us or we got in touch with them
[03:15:02.360 --> 03:15:06.280]  they said sure well come on we did a about a 30 minute interview and that is linked in this
[03:15:06.280 --> 03:15:12.760]  article shocking area 51 describes bombings machine gun attacks and nuclear testing by the feds and
[03:15:12.760 --> 03:15:15.960]  so this is about a minute and a half in we're going to play a couple minutes of that so let's go to
[03:15:15.960 --> 03:15:26.920]  that now late 40s the uh you know the gunnery range and that had been established and at that time
[03:15:26.920 --> 03:15:33.720]  they started to strafe the property with you know aircraft 50 caliber rounds yeah let me show you
[03:15:33.720 --> 03:15:38.600]  yeah they started using they started using your private property as a shooting range
[03:15:38.600 --> 03:15:47.080]  basically yes and there were people on property our grandparents are uh both of our fathers and
[03:15:47.080 --> 03:15:55.880]  our mothers along with you know in some cases kids wow and this continued through the 50s the big big
[03:15:55.880 --> 03:16:02.920]  problem started in 1951 with the first above ground nuclear test a test they did not even
[03:16:02.920 --> 03:16:10.360]  inform our family of wow if you can imagine you know you're out there a considerable distance
[03:16:10.360 --> 03:16:17.480]  from especially at that time from anything yeah and and this bomb goes off and not only are you
[03:16:17.480 --> 03:16:23.240]  you know you think oh my god what is it the nuclear don is here and you can't google it you
[03:16:23.240 --> 03:16:30.440]  can't call anyone you have no idea what occurred those above ground tests really started the demise
[03:16:30.440 --> 03:16:37.080]  of our what the fortune that our grandfather had built everything was paid for the mill was
[03:16:37.080 --> 03:16:42.680]  paid for his equipment was paid for you just didn't he didn't know anybody and he was making
[03:16:42.680 --> 03:16:46.520]  really good money at the time let me ask you about health effects because a lot of people
[03:16:46.520 --> 03:16:51.080]  are concerned about the long-term health effects of the nuclear radiation that was carried by the
[03:16:51.080 --> 03:16:56.440]  wind of course the the military exposed soldiers to these above ground nuclear tests uh were there
[03:16:56.440 --> 03:17:01.720]  any effects in your family yeah and yes there was some of that and i'm gonna hold this up and i hope
[03:17:01.720 --> 03:17:07.960]  you can you can get it if not we can tell you where to find it but right here this is a picture
[03:17:08.920 --> 03:17:16.680]  and that is our grandparents uh dan and martha shean along with ben's dad bob shean

[03:17:24.040 --> 03:17:31.560]  that picture was in a 1953 issue of national geographic this story ran in the sacramental
[03:17:31.560 --> 03:17:40.040]  b and if you look the story focuses on death disease followed tests wow family us silent on
[03:17:40.040 --> 03:17:45.160]  radiation risk there you go and um if you're interested in learning more about the sheans

[03:17:49.960 --> 03:17:54.360]  some of the uh elders they're talking about the health effects that they suffered after
[03:17:54.360 --> 03:17:59.480]  the nuclear testing going on 20 miles from their house 20 miles from their house so they're being
[03:17:59.480 --> 03:18:03.960]  used as guinea pigs by the federal government and you think this government if they will do this to
[03:18:03.960 --> 03:18:08.200]  just regular old people trying to make their living in an independent way you don't think they'll
[03:18:08.200 --> 03:18:12.840]  do it to 3 000 people working in the world trade center yeah in fact let's just look at what the
[03:18:12.840 --> 03:18:19.640]  official story is the official story is that terrorists with box cutters took over four planes
[03:18:19.640 --> 03:18:26.520]  they got 100 of their targets hijacked and then they hit 75 percent of their targets uh bypassing
[03:18:26.520 --> 03:18:31.880]  this multi multi multi million dollar aerospace defense system that we have located with it with
[03:18:31.880 --> 03:18:39.240]  norad just were able to fly on by doing whatever they want to do and and nobody got fired nobody
[03:18:39.240 --> 03:18:45.880]  got fired nobody got reprimanded after 3 000 people died okay and you believe and you believe that
[03:18:45.880 --> 03:18:50.040]  there's no inside job that that it was just terrorists you believe if you believe that
[03:18:50.040 --> 03:18:56.520]  you're a total moron also on info wars dot com video oathkeepers vow to guard kim davis from
[03:18:56.520 --> 03:19:00.920]  further imprisonment there's a uh interview there with uh sturt roads as you could check out i just
[03:19:00.920 --> 03:19:05.560]  want to read a little bit of sturt roads statement we believe the federal district court judge david
[03:19:05.560 --> 03:19:09.880]  bunning grossly overstepped his bounds and violated mrs davis due process rights and in
[03:19:09.880 --> 03:19:14.520]  particular her right to a jury trial the judge has assumed onto himself not just the powers of all
[03:19:14.520 --> 03:19:19.080]  three branches of government but also taken on the powers of judge jury and executioner what
[03:19:19.080 --> 03:19:23.240]  matters to us is not whether you agree with her position on gay marriage or her decision not to
[03:19:23.240 --> 03:19:28.520]  issue marriage licenses what matters is that the judge is violating the constitution in his anger
[03:19:28.520 --> 03:19:35.560]  and desire to punish her for going against his will that is the real story that is a real story
[03:19:35.560 --> 03:19:40.360]  here not whether or not she's going to issue state licenses to gay people who want to get married
[03:19:40.360 --> 03:19:44.760]  it's the fact that a judge put her in jail and she had no trial we have to have due process
[03:19:44.760 --> 03:19:48.600]  whether you agree with what she did or not if you're not for due process someday you won't
[03:19:48.600 --> 03:19:53.480]  be getting that due process so we have to stand up for everybody our none of us will be getting
[03:19:53.480 --> 03:19:59.080]  anything so also i'm going to do a little preview on an article uh wane madson's going to be on the

[03:24:01.240 --> 03:24:19.160]  the article at info wars dot com pedophile enabling prosecutors and
[03:24:19.160 --> 03:24:23.320]  officials try to run a pa an attorney general out of office this is an investigative report
[03:24:23.320 --> 03:24:28.280]  that Wayne Madsen did exclusively for info wars dot com he's going to be on the nightly news tonight
[03:24:28.280 --> 03:24:33.720]  with their with david night almost a derrick brane with david night talking about how this ties into
[03:24:33.720 --> 03:24:39.320]  the sandusky issue if you don't know penn state was where jerry sandusky was raping little boys
[03:24:39.320 --> 03:24:46.520]  in the shower and he's now in jail for it now i want to jump to the 28 pages piece that derrick
[03:24:46.520 --> 03:24:51.800]  brane put together and this is one of the big smoking guns out there right now so i think we're
[03:24:51.800 --> 03:24:54.680]  going to go straight to break from this when we come back we're going to have tony rook who's
[03:24:54.680 --> 03:25:00.600]  actually putting together a film where he stood up against the bbc and uh and what he believes
[03:25:00.600 --> 03:25:06.680]  is their 9 11 cover-up i believe it too so let's roll the 28 pages ran paul has joined the fight
[03:25:06.680 --> 03:25:12.680]  to get the federal government to release the missing 28 pages of the official 9 11 commission
[03:25:12.680 --> 03:25:19.000]  report and that was blocked and kept secret by the bush administration and that's because they
[03:25:19.000 --> 03:25:25.320]  know full well that the documents will prove once and for all that the saudi arabian government
[03:25:25.320 --> 03:25:34.440]  was directly involved in the attacks on september 11th so very embarrassing not to mention treasonous
[03:25:34.440 --> 03:25:42.280]  by george bush and dick cheney who are both implicated here in a massive cover-up and remember
[03:25:42.280 --> 03:25:51.080]  it was george dubby at bush himself the hypocrite who had this to say about anyone harboring terrorist
[03:25:51.080 --> 03:26:00.520]  every nation in every region now has a decision to make either you are with us or you are with
[03:26:00.520 --> 03:26:09.320]  the terrorists oh is that right george it's going to be like that uh you're either with us or you
[03:26:09.320 --> 03:26:16.680]  are with the terrorist well you're the one george dubby who vacations with the saudi royal family
[03:26:16.680 --> 03:26:21.720]  and you're also the one who used to vacation with the bin laden family you're also going to find
[03:26:21.720 --> 03:26:27.720]  yourself in prison if these documents ever see the light of day this sort of shocking when you
[03:26:27.720 --> 03:26:33.720]  read it as i read it we all had our own experience i had to stop every couple pages and just sort of
[03:26:33.720 --> 03:26:41.240]  absorb and try to rearrange my understanding of history for the past 13 years and the years
[03:26:41.240 --> 03:26:49.160]  leading up to that it challenges you to rethink everything and so i think the whole country
[03:26:49.160 --> 03:26:54.280]  needs to go through that's right these brave gentlemen have seen the 28 pages and they want
[03:26:54.280 --> 03:27:00.440]  the documents released you heard representative thomas massie say right there that it will challenge
[03:27:00.440 --> 03:27:07.880]  you to rethink everything whatever is in those documents is going to change world history i want
[03:27:07.880 --> 03:27:17.960]  those documents declassified i'm embarrassed to be associated with a work product that is secret
[03:27:17.960 --> 03:27:25.480]  but wait there's more former senator bob graham who also co-chaired the joint senate house investigation
[03:27:25.480 --> 03:27:32.600]  into the september 11th attacks he says i am convinced that there was a direct line between
[03:27:32.600 --> 03:27:38.280]  at least some of the terrorists who carried out the september 11th attacks and the government
[03:27:38.280 --> 03:27:46.360]  of saudi arabia he called it a smoking gun and he went on to say the reason for this cover-up
[03:27:46.360 --> 03:27:53.720]  goes right up to the white house meanwhile here's what they are saying in the new york post the
[03:27:53.720 --> 03:28:02.680]  soddies deny any role in 9 11 but the cia in one memo reportedly found incontrovertible evidence
[03:28:02.680 --> 03:28:08.840]  that saudi government officials not just wealthy saudi hardliners but high-level diplomats and
[03:28:08.840 --> 03:28:17.000]  intelligence officers employed by the kingdom helped the hijackers both financially and logistically
[03:28:17.000 --> 03:28:23.320]  and if the saudi government did indeed help finance and train the hijackers without my friends
[03:28:23.320 --> 03:28:31.560]  that is an act of war and i'm so glad to see the truth finally beginning to surface senator ran
[03:28:31.560 --> 03:28:39.560]  paul has just introduced legislation called the transparency for the families of 9 11 act and
[03:28:39.560 --> 03:28:47.400]  that would force the obama administration to release the 28 pages over a decade ago a bipartisan
[03:28:47.400 --> 03:28:53.560]  congressional committee investigated the 9 11 attacks and wrote a report 28 pages from that
[03:28:53.560 --> 03:28:59.640]  report have never been released to the public we're here today to call for the release of those 28
[03:28:59.640 --> 03:29:07.320]  pages the survivors civilian heroes and families of the victims of september 11 terrorist attacks
[03:29:07.320 --> 03:29:13.960]  some of whom are here today deserve the full truth we cannot let page after page of blanked out
[03:29:13.960 --> 03:29:19.080]  documents be obscured behind a veil leaving these families to wonder if there is additional
[03:29:19.080 --> 03:29:24.760]  information surrounding these horrible acts so there you have it ran paul thinks that we all
[03:29:24.760 --> 03:29:31.400]  have the right and that the 9 11 victims families have the right to see what's in those documents
[03:29:31.400 --> 03:29:38.040]  no matter how embarrassing or how incriminating it might be to george w bush so what do you say
[03:29:38.040 --> 03:29:44.760]  there w why don't you let us see what's in those 28 pages that's right you can watch the rest of
[03:29:44.760 --> 03:29:50.840]  that video on the alex jones channel on youtube we just uploaded it we're on the march the empires

[03:30:01.880 --> 03:30:07.800]  more than a flag it's more than knowing the star spangled banner it's knowing the constitution it's
[03:30:07.800 --> 03:30:12.760]  understanding those rights and fighting for them our country is falling apart because people have
[03:30:12.760 --> 03:30:18.360]  forgotten to fight to stand up in the face of tyranny and do the right thing it's putting your life

[03:30:28.840 --> 03:30:34.600]  rest on inference so the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of
[03:30:34.600 --> 03:30:40.440]  patriots and tyrants i'm joe biggs with info wars dot com and i believe our flag is more than
[03:30:40.440 --> 03:30:46.520]  clothening it is a symbol that stands for liberty and freedom it is a history of our nation and it's
[03:30:46.520 --> 03:30:52.600]  marked by the blood of those who died defending it so join me in this info war turn off your tv

[03:35:19.720 --> 03:35:24.680]  regular basis i did take it for a couple days and and then we ran out of it and i was taking one of
[03:35:24.680 --> 03:35:27.640]  the bottles that was open here but and now that it's back i think i'm going to get my hands on a
[03:35:27.640 --> 03:35:33.800]  couple bottles and try it out but let me read you some of the reviews from people who have been taking
[03:35:33.800 --> 03:35:40.040]  it this is from lydia the energy seeker in the uk i take one to two tablets a day and find the clarity
[03:35:40.040 --> 03:35:46.920]  of thinking has increased massively she gave it five stars and then we have blue and gainsville
[03:35:46.920 --> 03:35:51.400]  florida and first i was skeptical because i did not notice or feel an immediate difference
[03:35:51.400 --> 03:35:55.720]  after three weeks of daily use however i started to feel razor sharp in the afternoons after taking
[03:35:55.720 --> 03:36:00.280]  brain force while eating lunch every day on the days i did not take the supplement that intensity
[03:36:00.280 --> 03:36:06.120]  was not there bottom line this works and i have reordered it also giving it five stars check it
[03:36:06.120 --> 03:36:11.160]  out for yourself at info wars life dot com it's brain force we just got a new shipment in so

[03:37:02.440 --> 03:37:06.920]  of of course it's sad that we have to bring this up every year and talk about 9 11 because people
[03:37:06.920 --> 03:37:11.560]  refuse to get off their keysters and demand that the government tells the truth and but it's good
[03:37:11.560 --> 03:37:17.000]  to see people worldwide are fighting for this uh what first got you into wanting to uh explain this
[03:37:17.000 --> 03:37:25.080]  was it just 130 pounds that they wanted you to pay no no i mean originally i saw a video by a guy
[03:37:25.080 --> 03:37:31.400]  called mike rupert who was a los angeles detective when he was complaining about the the importing
[03:37:31.400 --> 03:37:38.920]  of drugs by the cia and it was just a segment of that that mentioned 9 11 i wasn't particularly
[03:37:38.920 --> 03:37:47.160]  knowledgeable about it but um as the years went by i i became i i did some research and um and then
[03:37:47.160 --> 03:37:55.080]  of course i saw saw building seven like so many of us and that began to worry me uh greatly um and
[03:37:55.080 --> 03:38:00.520]  then the bbc in this country you have to pay 140 pounds a year for the privilege of watching the
[03:38:00.520 --> 03:38:05.960]  television uh and when i'd seen building seven go down and i realized the bbc had reported
[03:38:05.960 --> 03:38:14.520]  that um a couple of times um 23 minutes before it occurred i decided that maybe i shouldn't pay the
[03:38:14.520 --> 03:38:20.280]  license fee anymore until they could tell me the original source of that report and and to this
[03:38:20.280 --> 03:38:25.480]  day they've never told me the original source of that report so i decided not to pay them and went
[03:38:25.480 --> 03:38:31.800]  to court there you go well that's you know that's the example of one man standing up and saying no
[03:38:31.800 --> 03:38:39.720]  no right there and caused a whole bunch of hubbub uh you want a lawsuit against them and um there's
[03:38:39.720 --> 03:38:44.200]  actually a video on that global research news it's you outside the courtroom i think right after
[03:38:44.200 --> 03:38:49.640]  it happened um but i want to go to a a clip of your your new film that's coming out your documentary
[03:38:50.200 --> 03:38:56.520]  incontrovertible the 9 11 truth versus the bbc court case and this is uh matt cambell who
[03:38:56.520 --> 03:39:01.560]  had a family member die in 9 11 and uh he kind of guides the film i guess we're we're just going
[03:39:01.560 --> 03:39:06.520]  to play a part of this uh start at the beginning guys and i'll just cut you out when uh when i feel
[03:39:06.520 --> 03:39:12.280]  it's right it's a longer clip but uh this is exclusive isn't it tony yes the first time anyone
[03:39:12.280 --> 03:39:22.040]  seen this all right so let's let's roll away guys we went to go and visit a chief inspector in um
[03:39:22.040 --> 03:39:28.360]  my sussex and you present her with stuff that clearly is not aligned with the official narrative
[03:39:28.360 --> 03:39:33.240]  they still choose to do nothing and and i've encountered that at all levels of the um
[03:39:33.960 --> 03:39:39.480]  british authorities you know whether it be the police the foreign and conworth office uh
[03:39:39.480 --> 03:39:45.080]  say it's essentially outside their jurisdiction and they rely on the official narrative of the us
[03:39:48.840 --> 03:39:54.040]  you can't see something be confronted with with such evidence that is in direct conflict
[03:39:54.040 --> 03:40:00.280]  with the official story and just choose to do nothing you know unless you're going massively
[03:40:00.280 --> 03:40:06.600]  into denial cognitive dissonance whatever you want to call it um i mean whoever you are whether
[03:40:06.600 --> 03:40:12.040]  in the police or not you know you've got to to look within yourself and is that what you should
[03:40:12.040 --> 03:40:20.600]  be doing is it right the police force they're they're regular people um and yep there there's
[03:40:20.600 --> 03:40:26.040]  going to be some fear that they may lose their jobs but this is going on everywhere people are
[03:40:26.040 --> 03:40:33.240]  waking up to corruption and just things that are blatantly not right if we just choose to be silent
[03:40:33.240 --> 03:40:39.640]  on that um it's not going to end well for any of us all right those are universal words for anyone
[03:40:39.640 --> 03:40:46.840]  out there who is covered or confronted by untruths or evil deeds and doesn't stand up you have to
[03:40:46.840 --> 03:40:56.600]  stand up would you agree tony tony can you hear me i think we might have lost him he's there but i
[03:40:56.600 --> 03:41:03.720]  don't know if he's getting my signal so the film is incontrovertible it's coming out in october
[03:41:05.560 --> 03:41:11.560]  and it was shot in the u.s. denmark switzerland scotland italy and the u k features retire cops
[03:41:11.560 --> 03:41:16.760]  firefighters politicians in x military and the aim of the film is to give serving law enforcement
[03:41:16.760 --> 03:41:20.680]  officers firefighters an insight into the problems with the official 9 11 narrative through the eyes
[03:41:20.680 --> 03:41:25.720]  of their own colleagues many of whom have greater experience than themselves and also illustrate
[03:41:25.720 --> 03:41:30.760]  the very notion of a false flag especially an american one is far from ludicrous but actually
[03:41:30.760 --> 03:41:34.920]  documented via the northwoods document something we covered here a lot on info wars and a painted
[03:41:34.920 --> 03:41:40.360]  picture of the modus operandi used in the past and now recently and also to rip a new arsehole
[03:41:41.080 --> 03:41:46.600]  out of my old buddies the bbc which they call anti and i guess today on the bbc uh it's nothing
[03:41:46.600 --> 03:41:53.080]  but queen love because i think the queenie is now the longest running uk monarch is that is that
[03:41:53.080 --> 03:41:57.880]  correct honey she is and i'm thrilled about it rob are you bowing down to the queen
[03:41:59.960 --> 03:42:06.280]  i guess you're not so um what what are some of the big uh smoking guns and evidence that you
[03:42:06.280 --> 03:42:12.920]  uncovered while working on this that you didn't know beforehand um well i mean before i started
[03:42:12.920 --> 03:42:18.120]  working on it i knew i knew all of them really um i i didn't know that there were an awful lot of
[03:42:18.120 --> 03:42:24.840]  police officers in america and in the uk that knew about it i mean i was very aware of it but um
[03:42:25.880 --> 03:42:33.960]  i i wasn't aware i i got a list of cops and firefighters especially cops uh he knew about
[03:42:33.960 --> 03:42:39.480]  it uh for my friends in low places and i was amazed and and everyone that we spoke to in
[03:42:39.480 --> 03:42:45.000]  the course of making the film i always asked them the question do you have any friends who agree with
[03:42:45.000 --> 03:42:51.640]  you and they said yeah loads so for the handful that we interviewed um i would have to say there
[03:42:51.640 --> 03:42:59.240]  must be thousands in america um who who realized that that we're being lied to so that's the reason
[03:42:59.240 --> 03:43:05.560]  i made the film um and god willing you know when people see that they'll they'll realize that right
[03:43:05.560 --> 03:43:09.960]  yeah all you have to do we're just showing up up there uh control demolitions next to building seven
[03:43:09.960 --> 03:43:15.640]  and it fall and in addition to the foreknowledge which the bbc had because they reported on it
[03:43:15.640 --> 03:43:20.360]  20 minutes before it fell you can also just watch the building fall buildings don't fall like that
[03:43:20.360 --> 03:43:24.680]  unless it's a controlled demolition and if it's a controlled demolition that means somebody was
[03:43:24.680 --> 03:43:28.760]  setting explosives inside the building uh last night on the nightly news we played a clip of
[03:43:28.760 --> 03:43:34.040]  emergency manager who worked inside building seven Barry Jennings who was hearing explosions
[03:43:34.040 --> 03:43:38.200]  coming from underneath him he's trying to get out of the building and and the buildings hadn't
[03:43:38.200 --> 03:43:42.600]  fallen yet they were still up at the time when he's trying to get out he walks through the lobby
[03:43:43.320 --> 03:43:50.120]  and the uh and it's strewn with bodies it's totally destroyed and he thinks he can't figure out why
[03:43:50.120 --> 03:43:53.560]  and they keep telling him well it was the boiler room that was on fire and he goes no i'm a i'm
[03:43:53.560 --> 03:43:59.720]  a boiler guy i know what a boiler explosion sounds like and that was no boiler explosion well he gets
[03:43:59.720 --> 03:44:04.360]  leukemia and dies before he's going to testify in that in that amazing and then we also uh played
[03:44:04.360 --> 03:44:10.520]  a clip of willy redriguez who is a he was a janitor there who heard explosions underneath him
[03:44:10.520 --> 03:44:15.480]  at the world trade center before the planes hit so but these guys will never see the light of day
[03:44:15.480 --> 03:44:19.480]  and in the they're not in the government nist report they're not in the 9-11 commission report
[03:44:19.480 --> 03:44:23.720]  they're they're left out of everything so it's it's a few small individuals that we have to
[03:44:23.720 --> 03:44:31.160]  fight against but it's good that people are waking up this next clip has a ray it's ray savage who's
[03:44:31.160 --> 03:44:36.120]  a 15-year sussex police officer how did you meet up with him and what's his uh how does he tie into
[03:44:36.120 --> 03:44:46.760]  the film ray trotted up to when i went to court against the bvc he turned up and we met um and
[03:44:46.760 --> 03:44:54.280]  you know it was refreshing to me a police officer uh when you go to court against the bvc or the
[03:44:54.280 --> 03:44:59.320]  establishment and told me that he felt the same way and i said well would you be willing to go on
[03:44:59.320 --> 03:45:05.720]  camera uh he said yes he would and so i filmed him and went to his his sort of rather nice house in
[03:45:05.720 --> 03:45:12.360]  uh in sussex near near where i live and uh we we chatted for an hour or two and and we have this
[03:45:12.360 --> 03:45:16.680]  little clip you're about to show yeah let's roll the clip now and then we'll come back and uh and
[03:45:16.680 --> 03:45:27.480]  finish up here joined as a cadet in 66 became a regular officer in 68 in my 19th year and was
[03:45:27.480 --> 03:45:33.480]  posted to bryton um but so really one of the highlights of my career was working on the
[03:45:33.480 --> 03:45:39.000]  regional crime squad uh i did intelligence work with the regional six regional crime squad which
[03:45:39.000 --> 03:45:45.160]  now doesn't exist uh it's some other form i also worked as a terrorist officer at gatwick airport
[03:45:46.280 --> 03:45:51.960]  in counterterrorism and um and quite a few other things i did a lot of surveillance work um
[03:45:51.960 --> 03:45:56.680]  taught surveillance uh was in the training department had quite a check of career i i had great
[03:45:56.680 --> 03:46:01.960]  disquiet really about went on and uh when i saw the evidence of building seven and the collapse of
[03:46:01.960 --> 03:46:08.920]  that i'd actually seen many controlled demolitions actually police one or two and you know when i
[03:46:08.920 --> 03:46:14.360]  saw that building seven pancake i absolutely knew that that was a controlled demolition there was
[03:46:14.360 --> 03:46:20.680]  just no doubt in my mind from the experience of seeing demolitions uh where as a police officer
[03:46:20.680 --> 03:46:24.440]  having to go there and actually put through a cordon around the building whilst it was pancake
[03:46:24.440 --> 03:46:30.440]  down so that really had me questioning and then of course when i saw the bpc news program the
[03:46:30.440 --> 03:46:36.440]  24 hour program with jane stanley announcing the building seven had fallen and seeing the disparity
[03:46:36.440 --> 03:46:42.920]  of the time the i think it was about a 20 20 minute in advance obviously uh you know she had
[03:46:42.920 --> 03:46:49.320]  very strong psychic powers or uh perhaps the script was read in in advance and that's certainly the
[03:46:50.040 --> 03:46:56.760]  the version that i prefer to believe so really my my my whole questioning um of that incident
[03:46:56.760 --> 03:47:03.160]  started then there you go that's a 15 year veteran police officer who doesn't buy what he's seeing
[03:47:03.160 --> 03:47:09.320]  you can find more information on incontrovertible at killing auntie films dot co dot uk killing
[03:47:09.320 --> 03:47:15.480]  auntie films dot co dot uk now tony did you ever get a hold of jane stanley were you ever to
[03:47:15.480 --> 03:47:21.800]  confront her and get her side of the story well well no because jane jane's jane's been interviewed
[03:47:21.800 --> 03:47:27.320]  before and i don't hold any grievance against jane stanley i don't hold any grievance against
[03:47:27.320 --> 03:47:32.440]  philip hayton who was the the news anchor in london when that happened i don't think they had
[03:47:32.440 --> 03:47:36.920]  anything to do with it no i don't think so either but they got the talking points and they read them
[03:47:36.920 --> 03:47:40.680]  and they did i mean philip hayton has been interviewed you can go onto the internet and
[03:47:40.680 --> 03:47:47.320]  and and see that um but no i i didn't bother to get a hold of them um i just got a hold of
[03:47:47.320 --> 03:47:51.960]  law enforcers who were used to analyzing evidence for the news to analyzing
[03:47:53.960 --> 03:47:59.320]  you know the story of a crime from beginning to end and and and see what they had to say
[03:47:59.320 --> 03:48:03.880]  yeah people using logic and deductive reasoning which is what exactly opposite of what you got
[03:48:03.880 --> 03:48:08.200]  with 9 11 and the commission report you got a bunch of hearsay you got a bunch of black
[03:48:08.200 --> 03:48:12.840]  dot documents 28 pages are missing hey who cares exactly yeah you know where now we're
[03:48:12.840 --> 03:48:17.960]  going to go fight wars endless wars in the middle east and try to conquer that for oil
[03:48:17.960 --> 03:48:21.960]  we're going to get the brits involved i mean what's been the total fallout in your country i mean
[03:48:22.680 --> 03:48:27.160]  in terms of the devastation of sending men to war and those men coming back we have a lot of
[03:48:27.160 --> 03:48:32.520]  wounded veterans here who are totally distraught they're on psychotropic drugs that commit suicide
[03:48:32.520 --> 03:48:40.040]  i know what's the fallout like in the uk well even in the mainstream media reported rob that we
[03:48:40.040 --> 03:48:44.600]  have more men committing suicide than of dying combat or men and women i guess i i shouldn't
[03:48:44.600 --> 03:48:50.440]  exclude ladies um and you know it's going to cost this country an awful lot of women we mean
[03:48:50.440 --> 03:48:55.640]  england remains the wagging tail of american foreign policy and much as i love america and i do
[03:48:55.640 --> 03:49:01.800]  i live there for many years and i love the united states but your government really is um i don't
[03:49:02.520 --> 03:49:09.400]  i don't want to use the word on on the uh on the internet but um yeah well yeah yeah we have
[03:49:09.400 --> 03:49:14.440]  i think it's 22 a day isn't it in the united states that committing suicide we have more
[03:49:14.440 --> 03:49:20.680]  guys committing suicide of dying combat in the uk so that's the fallout and and it's yes that's
[03:49:20.680 --> 03:49:25.320]  that is the real tragedy going on there it's not just going into other countries and killing other
[03:49:25.320 --> 03:49:30.840]  people and taking their land and property and resources and it's also when the guys come back
[03:49:30.840 --> 03:49:35.160]  they feel guilty they see what they were doing was a false mission they see all the hypocrisy
[03:49:35.160 --> 03:49:41.720]  behind it and then they can't live with themselves and that is it's very sad so uh i guess we got
[03:49:41.720 --> 03:49:45.560]  we got about a minute and a half left here uh what what's the final information that you would
[03:49:45.560 --> 03:49:49.240]  like to impart to people uh and and when your film's going to release in october how are you
[03:49:49.240 --> 03:49:55.400]  going to release it oh we're gonna we're gonna have a screening in london at a cinema in london
[03:49:55.400 --> 03:50:01.720]  so people can come along and buy the dvd the concept of the film is very simple um we're

[03:50:16.600 --> 03:50:22.440]  um and it and it says it's a film for police officers by police officers so hopefully they
[03:50:22.440 --> 03:50:26.840]  can go have a watch it and get the information that's been with health from them by the mainstream
[03:50:26.840 --> 03:50:31.080]  media for all these years there you go tony i recommend you put it out on the internet for

[03:54:16.360 --> 03:54:21.160]  david night will be interviewing wane matteson covering this story pedophile enabling prosecutors
[03:54:21.160 --> 03:54:25.880]  and officials try to run a pa attorney general out of office so that should be interesting
[03:54:25.880 --> 03:54:30.680]  to see what wane has to say we sent him there on assignment to harrisburg now joe you've got some
[03:54:30.680 --> 03:54:35.880]  updates on what's going on in fox lake you are actually there on the ground running around what
[03:54:35.880 --> 03:54:41.880]  turned out at some point it was a wild goose chase and now it turns out that the men that were on
[03:54:41.880 --> 03:54:47.480]  video aren't really suspects so what's going on in fox lake yeah i mean this is a really uh
[03:54:47.480 --> 03:54:53.320]  interesting scenario that's unfolding before us over in fox lake like you said uh when i was there
[03:54:53.320 --> 03:54:59.160]  they sent us on this you know goose chase through cornfields looking around thousands of people man
[03:54:59.160 --> 03:55:04.440]  power helicopters airplanes flying in the air for what essentially turned out to be a hoax and then
[03:55:04.440 --> 03:55:10.200]  you've got this manhunt going on for three men uh two white males and a black male suspect
[03:55:11.480 --> 03:55:15.720]  they finally get security footage the three people that are walking out where he was killed at that
[03:55:15.720 --> 03:55:20.120]  time the cops came out and said well hasn't those guys have nothing to do with it so now
[03:55:20.120 --> 03:55:25.880]  they're basing their entire investigation purely off of the 911 call or the uh the radio call from
[03:55:25.880 --> 03:55:30.360]  lieutenant joe glennowitz saying that he was in pursuit of three men so that's all they're going
[03:55:30.360 --> 03:55:36.840]  off on but what we do know is this 52 year old lieutenant had been shot twice now once towards
[03:55:36.840 --> 03:55:41.960]  the back of the neck and one the interesting shot the fatal blow the coroner said was under his vest
[03:55:41.960 --> 03:55:47.720]  in the stomach in the torso region and they said that's due to maybe possibly someone coming in
[03:55:47.720 --> 03:55:52.920]  that knew him got close to him and was able to kind of get that shot in there so here kind of comes
[03:55:52.920 --> 03:55:59.960]  the the the weird scenario what happened the coroner came out he says he's not saying that it's just
[03:55:59.960 --> 03:56:05.960]  a homicide he's not ruling out suicide and he's not ruling out an accident so that's the controversial
[03:56:05.960 --> 03:56:11.080]  comments that have been coming in that the coroner's comments say put the entire uh case at risk
[03:56:11.080 --> 03:56:14.520]  and the police officer and the people there in the task force are upset that he came out and said
[03:56:14.520 --> 03:56:20.280]  that so there's something really weird going on he was a gi joe this police station has been under
[03:56:20.280 --> 03:56:27.320]  investigation the chief of police there was just uh basically forced to step down uh prior to him
[03:56:27.320 --> 03:56:33.640]  being killed and he was known to have like he said been a boy scout so did he see something did he
[03:56:33.640 --> 03:56:38.120]  uncover something that was going on in this investigation is that what got him killed this
[03:56:38.120 --> 03:56:43.560]  is this entire you know three-man pursuit a complete and total hoax is it false so that's
[03:56:43.560 --> 03:56:46.920]  what we're trying to find out and i thought it was interesting you brought up a connection
[03:56:46.920 --> 03:56:52.760]  kind of with this story with uh taryn yakey from uh the oklahoma city bombing so yeah a lot of
[03:56:52.760 --> 03:56:56.920]  people don't know about taryn yakey because he's kind of you know that was pre-internet uh the
[03:56:56.920 --> 03:57:02.520]  oklahoma city bombing but uh we we have a film here at info wars store dot com called the noble
[03:57:02.520 --> 03:57:07.640]  lie which covers a lot of things about the oklahoma city bombing which are fishy one of which is the
[03:57:07.640 --> 03:57:12.040]  death of taryn yakey who was a man who was on the scene rescuing people he was police officer of
[03:57:12.040 --> 03:57:16.600]  the year he saw some things that he didn't like and he had some evidence in a storage building
[03:57:17.160 --> 03:57:22.840]  and he was got real paranoid i have interviewed one of his fellow officers don browning who was
[03:57:22.840 --> 03:57:26.760]  saying yeah he was he knew something was up he had information he wasn't ready to go public
[03:57:26.760 --> 03:57:35.000]  with it yet and then they find him in a field dead of several knife wounds some slashes a couple
[03:57:35.000 --> 03:57:42.600]  shots and they what they say is he crawled it had to be hundreds of yards from his police car cruiser
[03:57:42.600 --> 03:57:46.600]  which in there they said it looked like there had been a pig had been gutted and dragged himself
[03:57:46.600 --> 03:57:50.440]  all the way over to a tree and then decided to kill himself there uh he said he was being followed
[03:57:50.440 --> 03:57:56.440]  by two men of course that we never hear anything about that but they listed it as a suicide which
[03:57:56.440 --> 03:58:00.920]  i find highly improbable everybody that knows him said it's highly improbable that he did this
[03:58:00.920 --> 03:58:06.120]  yet were left with suicide so when i started hearing about this with the police officer and
[03:58:06.120 --> 03:58:11.400]  there were two gunshots i started my spidey since started tingling so you're gonna do a full report
[03:58:11.400 --> 03:58:15.800]  on this right yeah it's interesting like you said his last words or as soon as i shake these feds
[03:58:15.800 --> 03:58:19.960]  i'll be back and we'll go out to dinner i'm assuming he said that to a wife or something like that
[03:58:19.960 --> 03:58:24.840]  but it's the same thing with michael hasings feds are after me i'll be back i'm going off the radar
[03:58:24.840 --> 03:58:28.440]  for a little while right and now he and then his car blows up so this is what happens it doesn't
[03:58:28.440 --> 03:58:33.320]  mean it's the conspiracy doesn't mean that there's a hoax but we're rolling out buddy we're uh to do
[03:58:33.320 --> 03:58:37.000]  that put all that in your report this has been the overdrive hour i'm your host rob do we'll see
