[00:00.000 --> 00:06.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:06.000 --> 00:13.000]  Last night at half past ten that baby of mine wouldn't let me in so move it on over.
[00:13.000 --> 00:17.000]  Move it on over. Move it on over. Move it on over.
[00:17.000 --> 00:21.000]  Move over little dog cause the big dog's moving in.
[00:21.000 --> 00:24.000]  Waging war on corruption. She's changed the law.
[00:24.000 --> 00:27.000]  Crashing the lies and disinformation.
[00:27.000 --> 00:33.000]  Folks, it's Alex Jones. I'm here. Thank you for joining us on Thanksgiving.
[00:33.000 --> 00:37.000]  No, I'm not live, but I am recording this on the eve of Thanksgiving.
[00:37.000 --> 00:41.000]  We have some powerful re-broadcast coming up.
[00:41.000 --> 00:44.000]  I'm going to tape some more in the next segment on some key issues,
[00:44.000 --> 00:48.000]  but fellow Schlafly about what the open borders is really all about.
[00:48.000 --> 00:51.000]  That was a powerful interview from a month ago. That's going to re-air.
[00:51.000 --> 00:57.000]  And the Freeway Rick Ross interview is going to air as of taping Rick Ross, the rapper,
[00:57.000 --> 01:00.000]  one of the top rappers in the world who has hundreds of millions of fans.
[01:00.000 --> 01:06.000]  The fake Rick Ross has responded to Freeway Rick Ross and the video that we shot with him
[01:06.000 --> 01:10.000]  has gotten millions of views and is on BET, CNN, you name it.
[01:10.000 --> 01:17.000]  So it shows how we're crashing through the lies and disinformation getting into pop culture
[01:17.000 --> 01:21.000]  that's normally the weapon system of the globalist and trying to turn hip-hop
[01:21.000 --> 01:26.000]  that's turned into gangster rap into a tool to enlighten and awaken people
[01:26.000 --> 01:29.000]  to the New World Order to not be part of the thug culture.
[01:29.000 --> 01:37.000]  You see, I give thanks on Thanksgiving for all the great people that have stood up
[01:37.000 --> 01:42.000]  for liberty and freedom. And I give thanks for you, the listeners, and all that you've done.
[01:42.000 --> 01:49.000]  It's simply been humbling. I fight tyrants because they make me mad at a fundamental level
[01:49.000 --> 01:53.000]  and my instinct is to resist them, just as you do as well.
[01:53.000 --> 01:57.000]  And so no matter whether you're black, white, Hispanic, Asian, old, young,
[01:57.000 --> 02:03.000]  a Muslim, a Christian, or even an agnostic, if you don't want to be a slave
[02:03.000 --> 02:08.000]  and if you want to be free and if you like to see others succeed and you're not a hater,
[02:08.000 --> 02:14.000]  then we're all brothers and sisters together and that's really the unifying issue here.
[02:14.000 --> 02:20.000]  But they take our brotherly love, our sisterly love, that Bob Marley talked about
[02:20.000 --> 02:26.000]  and they use that to get us to then do suicidal things like bring in unlimited illegals
[02:26.000 --> 02:32.000]  who are unskilled, who can be politically molded into socialists to complete our journey to slavery.
[02:32.000 --> 02:37.000]  So we have to have tough love as well and really know how the world works
[02:37.000 --> 02:41.000]  so that they don't use our good intentions against us because it's really true.
[02:41.000 --> 02:45.000]  I used to hear the road to hell is paved with good intentions and I went no.
[02:45.000 --> 02:49.000]  It's paved by evil people manipulating the gullible.
[02:49.000 --> 02:53.000]  But still fundamentally that statement's true as I've gotten older.
[02:53.000 --> 03:01.000]  It is paved. The truck of tyranny, the train of tyranny and its camp followers
[03:01.000 --> 03:09.000]  rolls down the road but it is paved with it's for the children or oh it's a social safety net
[03:09.000 --> 03:16.000]  or oh the banks will implode if we don't give them this bailout that was really a political takeover.
[03:16.000 --> 03:18.000]  The world is sophisticated.
[03:18.000 --> 03:24.000]  Tyranny and evil hides behind that sophistication but there is a veil being lifted right now across the world.
[03:24.000 --> 03:29.000]  People really are waking up so the globalists, the social engineers are moving into trying to hijack
[03:29.000 --> 03:34.000]  awakenings and turn them towards their own plan for world government
[03:34.000 --> 03:40.000]  an autocratic computerized technological technocracy or to quote Darth Vader
[03:40.000 --> 03:44.000]  a technological terror that's been constructed to dehumanize.
[03:44.000 --> 03:49.000]  They're trying to sell the big plastic zeitgeist prison where the computers
[03:49.000 --> 03:54.000]  programmed by the globalists make all the decisions as the great equalizer into the future
[03:54.000 --> 04:00.000]  and we'll all get our 200 square foot prison dormitory homes and all be told what to eat
[04:00.000 --> 04:03.000]  and when to go to work and what we're going to be when we grow up.
[04:03.000 --> 04:08.000]  This is the end of free will. This is humans being turned into nothing but biological androids
[04:08.000 --> 04:14.000]  as I've said so many times and I stand for resisting that and believing in humanity
[04:14.000 --> 04:19.000]  and trying to build everyone up so as the Democratic Party tries to fan the flames
[04:19.000 --> 04:26.000]  of the sad Ferguson Brown story to create a larger conflagration
[04:26.000 --> 04:30.000]  it's important to realize that they have to divide us so they can conquer us.
[04:30.000 --> 04:34.000]  Does that mean the police state is a good thing? No, it's terrible.
[04:34.000 --> 04:37.000]  But just fighting with it won't defeat it.
[04:37.000 --> 04:45.000]  We have to reach out and point out the tyranny and talk about alternatives to it and come together.
[04:45.000 --> 04:50.000]  That's how we'll really triumph with a velvet revolution of ideas not of guns.
[04:50.000 --> 04:55.000]  But we should have the Second Amendment to defend ourselves as a backup.
[04:55.000 --> 05:19.000]  We'll be back straight ahead.
[05:26.000 --> 05:33.000]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[05:33.000 --> 05:37.000]  At the same time they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[05:37.000 --> 05:39.000]  Can you put two and two together?
[05:39.000 --> 05:44.000]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round including hollow points and 308 sniper rounds
[05:44.000 --> 05:47.000]  is reasonably priced and fully legal.
[05:47.000 --> 05:50.000]  But for how long? Go to infidelbodyarmor.com
[05:50.000 --> 05:54.000]  spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L body armor dot com
[05:54.000 --> 05:58.000]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[06:24.000 --> 06:29.000]  20% off and free shipping on all Silver Bullet across the board while supplies last
[06:29.000 --> 06:32.000]  and to help everyone stock up for the next shortage.
[06:32.000 --> 06:36.000]  When you buy four bottles of Silver Bullet, you'll receive the fifth one absolutely free.
[06:36.000 --> 06:40.000]  That's on top of the 20% off savings and free shipping.
[06:40.000 --> 06:44.000]  Finally, if supplies hold, we will extend this special out to Cyber Monday.
[06:44.000 --> 06:47.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've never done anything like this before.
[06:47.000 --> 06:52.000]  Find this mother of all specials and others I've not yet announced yet at infowarstore.com
[06:52.000 --> 06:55.000]  or call 888-253-3139.
[06:55.000 --> 06:58.000]  That's infowarstore.com.
[06:58.000 --> 07:02.000]  On the eve of Thanksgiving this year, I was thinking, what am I really thankful for?
[07:02.000 --> 07:06.000]  And I gotta tell you, it's my family, it's all the blessings of liberty that our forebearers secured
[07:06.000 --> 07:11.000]  and it's you, the listeners of the broadcast who've made everything we do possible.
[07:11.000 --> 07:16.000]  This Black Friday, I decided to bring you the biggest special we've ever offered
[07:16.000 --> 07:19.000]  on any of the nutraceuticals at infowarslife.com.
[07:19.000 --> 07:23.000]  I'm talking about Silver Bullet, Loyal Silver that we've been sold out of for months.
[07:23.000 --> 07:25.000]  This time I doubled down and got even more.
[07:25.000 --> 07:29.000]  As of me taping this on the eve of Thanksgiving, we have already sold half of it.
[07:29.000 --> 07:34.000]  So instead of keeping the price at its regular discounted price, we are going to give you 20% off
[07:34.000 --> 07:36.000]  and free shipping on single bottles.
[07:36.000 --> 07:40.000]  But if you get four bottles, we're gonna give you the fifth one free and the free shipping.
[07:40.000 --> 07:44.000]  I don't know how long this special will run, but if supplies last, we will extend it out until Cyber Monday.
[07:44.000 --> 07:49.000]  You'll find powerful nutraceuticals like Silver Bullet and others at infowarslife.com
[07:49.000 --> 07:52.000]  by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[07:52.000 --> 07:56.000]  Again, this is Alex Jones, wishing you all a blessed and happy Thanksgiving
[07:56.000 --> 08:15.000]  and thanking you all for your support of freedom.
[08:27.000 --> 08:31.000]  Rear it across fine stations throughout the United States,
[08:31.000 --> 08:36.000]  blasting out via the internet and global shortwave to the rest of the planet.
[08:36.000 --> 08:41.000]  Well, we're going to have some rebroadcasts today here on Thanksgiving.
[08:41.000 --> 08:42.000]  Thank you for joining us.
[08:42.000 --> 08:45.000]  Phyllis Schlafly is coming up on the Open Border Invasion.
[08:45.000 --> 08:52.000]  We have the Rick Ross interview that two weeks after we did it live is an international news story from BET to CNN.
[08:52.000 --> 08:58.000]  We took over the Rick Ross meme of the top rapper that uses the real Rick Ross's name,
[08:58.000 --> 09:01.000]  and we're reaching out to the whole gangster hip-hop community,
[09:01.000 --> 09:06.000]  explaining to them how it's all a CIA shy-op to create a thug culture,
[09:06.000 --> 09:11.000]  which we now see invading and taking over protest across the country
[09:11.000 --> 09:15.000]  and the Democratic Party fanning the flames of that to create racial division
[09:15.000 --> 09:19.000]  to distract everybody from Obama's executive order operations.
[09:19.000 --> 09:22.000]  In fact, we played a clip yesterday on the show.
[09:22.000 --> 09:29.000]  Maybe we can cue it up right now where we have Obama coming out, if you can, it doesn't matter, guys,
[09:29.000 --> 09:32.000]  coming out and saying, hey, don't heckle me.
[09:32.000 --> 09:34.000]  I changed the law to legalize illegals.
[09:34.000 --> 09:36.000]  But even that isn't enough.
[09:36.000 --> 09:39.000]  Well, you can't just change laws with executive orders.
[09:39.000 --> 09:41.000]  Congress makes the laws.
[09:41.000 --> 09:43.000]  What am I thankful for on Thanksgiving?
[09:43.000 --> 09:46.000]  The fact that I am on the air rallying patriots worldwide.
[09:46.000 --> 09:49.000]  It's very humbling. Know that I am very humble.
[09:49.000 --> 09:51.000]  I appreciate all of you.
[09:51.000 --> 09:55.000]  And we couldn't do it without all of you and the AM and FM affiliates
[09:55.000 --> 10:00.000]  and the sponsors and the good Lord above and my family and the incredible crew.
[10:00.000 --> 10:05.000]  So I just want to say great job to the crew, everybody in there, Richard, Nico, CJ,
[10:05.000 --> 10:08.000]  everybody behind the scenes that makes it all possible.
[10:08.000 --> 10:10.000]  There's no way to thank them all.
[10:10.000 --> 10:13.000]  I want to thank all of you out there for your prayers as well.
[10:13.000 --> 10:16.000]  And I want to give something back.
[10:16.000 --> 10:20.000]  I mean, really, it's kind of a paradox as you're giving to us to help fund the operation.
[10:20.000 --> 10:24.000]  But it's a win-win-win because you also get high quality products.
[10:24.000 --> 10:30.000]  We ran a special yesterday and it's almost sold out of the remaining colloidal silver bullet
[10:30.000 --> 10:37.000]  where you can get four bottles with 20% off and you can get a free shipping on that and a free bottle.
[10:37.000 --> 10:42.000]  Free bottle, free shipping and 20% off the four bottles to begin with.
[10:42.000 --> 10:48.000]  And then on top of that, a single bottle is 20% off and free shipping, unprecedented special.
[10:48.000 --> 10:49.000]  That's still running.
[10:49.000 --> 10:56.000]  We're running a Pro Pure special today on the high quality gravity-fed water filters.
[10:56.000 --> 10:59.000]  Now get this for 24 hours only.
[10:59.000 --> 11:01.000]  That's all you can get authorization from the manufacturer.
[11:01.000 --> 11:08.000]  50% off all new Pro Pure Prepper series.
[11:08.000 --> 11:14.000]  50% off infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com.
[11:14.000 --> 11:16.000]  There's a bunch of other specials up there.
[11:16.000 --> 11:18.000]  We've never had specials anywhere near this.
[11:18.000 --> 11:21.000]  It's our thanks to you on Thanksgiving.
[11:21.000 --> 11:26.000]  Here is Phyllis Schlafly on this holiday.
[11:26.000 --> 11:29.000]  But at the top, these are not leftist.
[11:29.000 --> 11:36.000]  These are deranged control freaks, more akin to what you saw in the French Revolution.
[11:36.000 --> 11:40.000]  The only behavior I've seen like this is in the French Revolution.
[11:40.000 --> 11:44.000]  If you study the degeneracy of the Jacobins and others, I don't want to go into a history lesson here.
[11:44.000 --> 11:46.000]  Phyllis Schlafly joins us.
[11:46.000 --> 11:47.000]  Thank you so much.
[11:47.000 --> 11:51.000]  I know you want to get into 2014 elections, what you think that really signified.
[11:51.000 --> 11:52.000]  The landscape.
[11:52.000 --> 11:54.000]  Is it a big political realignment?
[11:54.000 --> 11:55.000]  I certainly think so.
[11:55.000 --> 12:01.000]  Can we defeat the establishment Republicans that will try to play ball with the same crony capitalist?
[12:01.000 --> 12:05.000]  Looking forward at 2016, what do you see in your crystal ball?
[12:05.000 --> 12:10.000]  We'll discuss it all today and the republishing of your book, Phyllis.
[12:10.000 --> 12:14.000]  But first off, we commend your 55 years of work for liberty.
[12:14.000 --> 12:23.000]  And we'd like to get your take on my little rant discussing the arrogance that we're seeing out of the so-called left right now.
[12:23.000 --> 12:27.000]  How would you characterize the mental state of these people?
[12:27.000 --> 12:30.000]  Well, thank you for all the kind words you said, Alex.
[12:30.000 --> 12:32.000]  It's good to be on with you.
[12:32.000 --> 12:41.000]  And you are right, and they deserve a rant because they have really brought this country down the wrong path,
[12:41.000 --> 12:45.000]  and the majority of Americans admitted were going in the wrong way.
[12:45.000 --> 12:50.000]  And I think what they really want is power and money, our money.
[12:50.000 --> 12:57.000]  And they want to make sure that the government has control and make the decisions for us.
[12:57.000 --> 13:04.000]  When I grew up, I guess it was years before you grew up, but we had a country of middle-class families
[13:04.000 --> 13:07.000]  who had intact nuclear families.
[13:07.000 --> 13:14.000]  That is, the mother and father were married to each other and raising their own children in one household.
[13:14.000 --> 13:19.000]  And now that's just the minority of people in our country.
[13:19.000 --> 13:24.000]  But the nuclear family was a self-contained economic unit.
[13:24.000 --> 13:29.000]  They made their own decisions, decided how they were going to raise their children.
[13:29.000 --> 13:31.000]  And now we don't have that anymore.
[13:31.000 --> 13:39.000]  And you find the liberals who want to give us government control of everything.
[13:39.000 --> 13:44.000]  You know, this speech that Obama made up in Rhode Island a couple of weeks ago,
[13:44.000 --> 13:48.000]  which he said we just shouldn't allow women to have the choice,
[13:48.000 --> 13:54.000]  the word choice, of taking care of their own children or being in the workforce.
[13:54.000 --> 13:57.000]  Because we want them to be in the workforce so they pay more taxes
[13:57.000 --> 14:02.000]  so we can provide them with government childcare and raise their children.
[14:02.000 --> 14:09.000]  And so first they sell the idea that a woman's not worthy if she doesn't have some job paying all these taxes.
[14:09.000 --> 14:13.000]  And great, a woman wants a career, go be a constitutional lawyer, change the world like you've done, more power to them.
[14:13.000 --> 14:19.000]  If a man wants to stay home with the kids, more power to them or wants to go out and work in a factory or build a factory.
[14:19.000 --> 14:24.000]  I mean, that's free will, but the demonization of a maternal role.
[14:24.000 --> 14:34.000]  And then now saying women just shouldn't have the choice, they should be made to go out into the system and let the state raise the children.
[14:34.000 --> 14:38.000]  That's what MSNBC has been saying in promos now for two years.
[14:38.000 --> 14:42.000]  Every week promos, they're saying your kids belong to the state.
[14:42.000 --> 14:45.000]  They're really coming out of the closet, aren't they?
[14:45.000 --> 14:46.000]  They certainly are.
[14:46.000 --> 14:51.000]  And of course, when you go in the workforce, you're going to pay taxes.
[14:51.000 --> 14:57.000]  And that's going to give these bureaucrats more of your money to spend and tell you how to spend it.
[14:57.000 --> 15:04.000]  Here's Melissa Harris Perry in a MSNBC promo saying that we got to get past the idea that your kids belong to you.
[15:04.000 --> 15:09.000]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents
[15:09.000 --> 15:13.000]  or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[15:13.000 --> 15:19.000]  Once it's everybody's responsibility and not just the households, then we start making better investments.
[15:19.000 --> 15:22.000]  Well, that's real straight to the left-wing heresy.
[15:22.000 --> 15:25.000]  Yes, it's just absolutely wrong.
[15:25.000 --> 15:30.000]  Everything we know means children do better when they're raised by their own parents.
[15:30.000 --> 15:35.000]  In fact, we poured all this money into public schools in an attempt to close the gap.
[15:35.000 --> 15:40.000]  Those are the magic words between the high achieving and the low achieving students.
[15:40.000 --> 15:44.000]  And they used to think the real cause of the gap was poverty.
[15:44.000 --> 15:47.000]  And now reason research shows it's really not poverty.
[15:47.000 --> 15:51.000]  It's whether or not the kids are raised by their own mother and father.
[15:51.000 --> 15:54.000]  And those who are are going to do better in school.
[15:54.000 --> 15:57.000]  And of course, they knew that in the social engineering.
[15:57.000 --> 16:00.000]  And that's why they've worked as hard as they can to break up the family.
[16:00.000 --> 16:02.000]  They know full well what they're doing.
[16:02.000 --> 16:06.000]  They're premeditated. What do you make of more and more Democrats and leftists
[16:06.000 --> 16:10.000]  coming out and admitting they lie and admitting they deceive
[16:10.000 --> 16:13.000]  and admitting they want to wreck the economy so they can be in control?
[16:13.000 --> 16:18.000]  I mean, for me, that is criminal fraud to have people involved in Obamacare
[16:18.000 --> 16:22.000]  coming out and saying we lied to Congress, we lied to the public.
[16:22.000 --> 16:24.000]  I mean, that's just outrageous.
[16:24.000 --> 16:29.000]  Well, you know, this case that the Supreme Court has just taken, it's really pretty funny.
[16:29.000 --> 16:37.000]  It's about Obamacare. And when the Obamacare said that you only got the subsidies,
[16:37.000 --> 16:41.000]  if your exchange was set up by the state, it was very clear.
[16:41.000 --> 16:43.000]  They're not equivocal at all.
[16:43.000 --> 16:49.000]  And they wanted people to, but most of the states didn't sign up for it.
[16:49.000 --> 16:52.000]  And so the people want to get the subsidies anyway.
[16:52.000 --> 16:56.000]  And they're trying to get the Supreme Court to rewrite the legislation.
[16:56.000 --> 17:01.000]  Now, our Constitution says all legislative powers in the Congress is very clear.
[17:01.000 --> 17:03.000]  There's nothing equivocal about it.
[17:03.000 --> 17:06.000]  And the Supreme Court is going to take that case.
[17:06.000 --> 17:09.000]  And the question is, are they going to stick to the way it was written,
[17:09.000 --> 17:11.000]  or are they going to rewrite it?
[17:11.000 --> 17:16.000]  Well, there's a real power struggle in American intelligency and the elites itself
[17:16.000 --> 17:21.000]  for so long the Republican blue bloods have worked with the left in this radical transformation.
[17:21.000 --> 17:25.000]  Now that we see that it's designed to wreck the country and fold us into global government,
[17:25.000 --> 17:31.000]  a lot of elites who aren't completely criminal are now trying to put the brakes on things.
[17:31.000 --> 17:35.000]  I know you have a lot of high-level contacts inside the system.
[17:35.000 --> 17:44.000]  Do you think that's an accurate statement that there is a serious re-looking at things inside of the establishment
[17:44.000 --> 17:47.000]  and that a lot of people are realizing that we better turn back now?
[17:47.000 --> 17:50.000]  Well, I don't see much evidence that it's the establishment.
[17:50.000 --> 17:55.000]  The big boys, the chamber of commerce types, were rethinking it because they like it
[17:55.000 --> 18:05.000]  when we bring in cheap labor so they can raise their stockpile value can go up.
[18:05.000 --> 18:10.000]  But I think the American people are catching on that most of the people who are coming in
[18:10.000 --> 18:13.000]  are willing to work for lower wages.
[18:13.000 --> 18:19.000]  And they were asking me to comment on these states that passed the minimum wage law
[18:19.000 --> 18:21.000]  in the other day.
[18:21.000 --> 18:27.000]  But it's not the actual amount of the wage that is attracting them.
[18:27.000 --> 18:33.000]  These people who come in are willing to work for much lower than the minimum wage.
[18:33.000 --> 18:36.000]  And they genuinely also get welfare on the side as a supplement.
[18:36.000 --> 18:38.000]  Yes, they certainly do.
[18:38.000 --> 18:40.000]  That's right.
[18:40.000 --> 18:43.000]  And so I think the American people are waking up.
[18:43.000 --> 18:50.000]  And the big question now is are we going to let Obama get by with his executive amnesty,
[18:50.000 --> 18:53.000]  which is he wants to bring more cheap labor.
[18:53.000 --> 18:56.000]  And of course he's bringing in all these diseases.
[18:56.000 --> 19:02.000]  We've got children dying with this new kind of a TB disease that's being brought in
[19:02.000 --> 19:08.000]  by these unaccompanied minors who are coming in and trying to go into our schools.
[19:08.000 --> 19:13.000]  And our children are being sacrificed, regardless of what color, on the altar of globalism.
[19:13.000 --> 19:16.000]  That's why they couldn't control the borders or planes with Ebola,
[19:16.000 --> 19:20.000]  because they don't want to ever send the message that having a border might be something you might want to have.
[19:20.000 --> 19:22.000]  Fellow Schlafly, stay there.
[19:22.000 --> 19:25.000]  We're going to come back and I want to get into 2014.
[19:25.000 --> 19:27.000]  How big of a wake-up was it?
[19:27.000 --> 19:30.000]  2016, Obama's executive power grab.
[19:30.000 --> 19:32.000]  Will the Republican establishment try to block it?
[19:32.000 --> 19:34.000]  But I want to agree with you.
[19:34.000 --> 19:37.000]  It's the grassroots that's waking up.
[19:37.000 --> 19:39.000]  Not even so much the elite.
[19:39.000 --> 19:43.000]  But I am seeing a lot of signs that there are a lot of people in the establishment
[19:43.000 --> 19:46.000]  that do see now that we're coming to the end of the road
[19:46.000 --> 19:50.000]  and that globalism is not really a good idea.
[19:50.000 --> 19:54.000]  And so they may want to change sides basically right here at the end
[19:54.000 --> 19:56.000]  so they don't get the blame.
[19:56.000 --> 20:08.000]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[20:26.000 --> 20:29.000]  That's HarvestWrite.com.
[20:57.000 --> 21:03.000]  For months, the InfoWars live silver bullet colloidal silver has been completely sold out.

[21:08.000 --> 21:10.000]  But here's what's truly exciting.
[21:10.000 --> 21:15.000]  While we could simply sell the survival silver for its already discounted shelf price,
[21:15.000 --> 21:21.000]  we have decided to give back to you, the listeners, who make it all possible with a pre-Black Friday mega sale.

[21:44.000 --> 21:47.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've never done anything like this before.

[31:54.000 --> 31:59.000]  Thank you very much.
[31:59.000 --> 32:01.800]  Another major health threat, this one in Toledo, Ohio,
[32:01.800 --> 32:03.440]  where everybody in the entire city
[32:03.440 --> 32:05.280]  has been told not to drink the water.
[32:05.280 --> 32:07.960]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[32:07.960 --> 32:10.240]  Did you know that the average person uses
[32:10.240 --> 32:14.920]  about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[32:14.920 --> 32:18.000]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[32:18.000 --> 32:21.040]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[32:21.040 --> 32:22.920]  Well, here at a supermarket in Toledo,
[32:22.920 --> 32:25.880]  you can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[32:25.880 --> 32:28.560]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis,
[32:28.560 --> 32:31.560]  you must have access to safe, clean water,
[32:31.560 --> 32:33.440]  water which will not be available
[32:33.440 --> 32:35.120]  at your local grocery store.
[32:35.120 --> 32:38.200]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[33:26.080 --> 33:31.080]  It was Mary Goldwater, who almost became president,
[33:31.080 --> 33:34.080]  but they ran TV ads saying there'd be nuclear war.
[33:34.080 --> 33:36.080]  We'd all die if he got elected.
[33:36.080 --> 33:39.080]  The Trilateralist Commission is international
[33:39.080 --> 33:41.080]  and is intended to be the vehicle
[33:41.080 --> 33:44.080]  for the multinational consolidation of the commercial
[33:44.080 --> 33:46.080]  and banking interest by seizing control
[33:46.080 --> 33:49.080]  of the political government of the United States.
[33:49.080 --> 33:52.080]  The Trilateralist Commission represents a skillful,
[33:52.080 --> 33:55.080]  coordinated effort to seize control
[33:55.080 --> 33:57.080]  and consolidate the four centers of power,
[33:57.080 --> 34:00.080]  political, monetary, intellectual, and ecclesiastical.
[34:00.080 --> 34:02.080]  They've got most of the churches.
[34:02.080 --> 34:04.080]  They've got things by the Federal Reserve.
[34:04.080 --> 34:06.080]  They've got the Democratic Party and most of the Republicans.
[34:06.080 --> 34:09.080]  They've taken control of the universities.
[34:09.080 --> 34:12.080]  That's from his book from U.S. Senator from Arizona,
[34:12.080 --> 34:15.080]  Mary Goldwater, with no apologies.
[34:15.080 --> 34:17.080]  And I know folks that knew Mary Goldwater,
[34:17.080 --> 34:19.080]  just of course Phyllis Schlafly knew him well.
[34:19.080 --> 34:20.080]  What a great guy.
[34:20.080 --> 34:22.080]  It's wonderful it would have been to have him as president.
[34:22.080 --> 34:24.080]  Reagan had great rhetoric about how,
[34:24.080 --> 34:26.080]  you know, you did build your business
[34:26.080 --> 34:28.080]  and freedom's great and everything else.
[34:28.080 --> 34:30.080]  Politics got away from him in the Congress
[34:30.080 --> 34:32.080]  and some bad things happened.
[34:32.080 --> 34:34.080]  Some things I disagree with under Reagan
[34:34.080 --> 34:36.080]  and Ron Paul criticized those as well.
[34:36.080 --> 34:38.080]  But compare Ronald Reagan to Obama
[34:38.080 --> 34:40.080]  who says you didn't build your business
[34:40.080 --> 34:42.080]  and Hillary came out and said,
[34:42.080 --> 34:44.080]  businesses don't hire people.
[34:44.080 --> 34:46.080]  There's a war against reality.
[34:46.080 --> 34:48.080]  We're going to talk to her and walk through
[34:48.080 --> 34:51.080]  because it's very exciting and I want to hear some of these stories.
[34:51.080 --> 34:53.080]  Then we're going to open the phones up
[34:53.080 --> 34:55.080]  for your quick question or comment,
[34:55.080 --> 34:57.080]  whether you agree, disagree, whatever,
[34:57.080 --> 34:58.080]  for Phyllis Schlafly.
[34:58.080 --> 35:01.080]  The toll-free number to join us on this live Monday edition
[35:01.080 --> 35:06.080]  is 800-259-9231.
[35:06.080 --> 35:11.080]  800-259-9231.
[35:11.080 --> 35:14.080]  Questions or comments for Phyllis Schlafly.
[35:14.080 --> 35:16.080]  Again, I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[35:16.080 --> 35:18.080]  Thank you for joining us.
[35:46.080 --> 35:48.080]  We're going to get one of those Navy SEALs
[35:48.080 --> 35:51.080]  that I was the company on in the next few days.
[35:51.080 --> 35:54.080]  The point is, we know stuff that's interesting.
[35:54.080 --> 35:56.080]  We've got some new belt buckles coming in
[35:56.080 --> 35:58.080]  that are Molan Labe that will sell out quickly
[35:58.080 --> 36:00.080]  that are made in America.
[36:00.080 --> 36:04.080]  And all of this funds the in-full-wars operation.
[36:04.080 --> 36:06.080]  We're not like MSNBC.
[36:06.080 --> 36:08.080]  They got stimulus money or NPR
[36:08.080 --> 36:11.080]  that gets 400 million taxpayer money every year.
[36:11.080 --> 36:13.080]  We are not like MSNBC.
[36:13.080 --> 36:16.080]  400 million taxpayer money every year.
[36:16.080 --> 36:18.080]  We are funded by folks buying the great products
[36:18.080 --> 36:21.080]  at infowarstore.com
[36:21.080 --> 36:24.080]  or maiden1776.com
[36:24.080 --> 36:28.080]  or the great supplements at infowarslife.com.
[36:28.080 --> 36:31.080]  Now infowarstore.com takes you to a directory
[36:31.080 --> 36:33.080]  of all those sites and shopping carts.
[36:33.080 --> 36:36.080]  It's basically like a whole shopping center right there.
[36:36.080 --> 36:38.080]  But when you buy the products from us,
[36:38.080 --> 36:42.080]  it funds the operation you're shopping with the good guys.
[36:42.080 --> 36:45.080]  On top of it, the proprietary supplements
[36:45.080 --> 36:49.080]  like DNA force, survival shield, X2, oxy powder,
[36:49.080 --> 36:52.080]  all of it is proprietary to the site
[36:52.080 --> 36:54.080]  and to our developer, Dr. Group.
[36:54.080 --> 36:57.080]  And you've heard the incredible reviews out there.
[36:57.080 --> 36:59.080]  So infowarstore.com and here's the good news.
[36:59.080 --> 37:01.080]  The products are very popular.
[37:01.080 --> 37:02.080]  Here's the bad news.
[37:02.080 --> 37:04.080]  We are about to sell out a survival shield.
[37:04.080 --> 37:06.080]  We are about to sell out of lung cleanse.
[37:06.080 --> 37:08.080]  We are about to sell out of DNA force, oxy powder,
[37:08.080 --> 37:11.080]  supermail vitality, basically everything.
[37:11.080 --> 37:14.080]  Right as more colloidal silver is set to come in next week
[37:14.080 --> 37:16.080]  and right as one of our new products
[37:16.080 --> 37:17.080]  is set to come in next week.
[37:17.080 --> 37:20.080]  We actually have some of it in, but not enough to even offer it.
[37:20.080 --> 37:24.080]  So if you want any of these products, infowarslife.com,
[37:24.080 --> 37:27.080]  also recommend the great young Jevity line of products

[37:54.080 --> 37:58.080]  Going back to Phyllis Schlafly, of course, of the Eagle Forum.
[37:58.080 --> 38:00.080]  Phyllis, talk about some of the history.
[38:00.080 --> 38:01.080]  Talk about Barry Goldwater.
[38:01.080 --> 38:03.080]  Talk about the new edition of your book
[38:03.080 --> 38:06.080]  and why it's so important for people to get it.
[38:06.080 --> 38:10.080]  Well, when I brought out a choice not an echo,
[38:10.080 --> 38:13.080]  it had this enormous fail.
[38:13.080 --> 38:16.080]  And what it did was to inspire people to believe
[38:16.080 --> 38:19.080]  that the grassroots could win against the establishment
[38:19.080 --> 38:22.080]  and nominate a real conservative.
[38:22.080 --> 38:26.080]  Now let me remind you that in that time period,
[38:26.080 --> 38:29.080]  presidents were supposed to come from New York, Pennsylvania,
[38:29.080 --> 38:33.080]  or Ohio, and Barry Goldwater was of Arizona.
[38:33.080 --> 38:37.080]  I didn't know anybody who had ever been to Arizona.
[38:37.080 --> 38:40.080]  There was no baseball team that was farther west
[38:40.080 --> 38:42.080]  or south than St. Louis.
[38:42.080 --> 38:44.080]  It was so far away and so different.
[38:44.080 --> 38:46.080]  And yet we picked him, and we made speeches,
[38:46.080 --> 38:49.080]  so I made speeches all over the country for him.
[38:49.080 --> 38:52.080]  And it did get nominated.
[38:52.080 --> 38:54.080]  Of course, they clobbered him in the election.
[38:54.080 --> 38:58.080]  But we stayed together as the grassroots conservative.
[38:58.080 --> 39:01.080]  And then came Ronald Reagan, and we got him elected,
[39:01.080 --> 39:04.080]  and he had two wonderful presidencies,
[39:04.080 --> 39:06.080]  and not perfect, but certainly better than anything
[39:06.080 --> 39:08.080]  that Democrats had to offer.
[39:08.080 --> 39:11.080]  And then they kind of disintegrated after that.
[39:11.080 --> 39:13.080]  And we had people who pretended to be conservatives.
[39:13.080 --> 39:15.080]  They really weren't.
[39:15.080 --> 39:18.080]  And we've got to revive them.
[39:18.080 --> 39:22.080]  And that's why I come out with my 50th anniversary edition
[39:22.080 --> 39:24.080]  of a choice not an echo.
[39:24.080 --> 39:26.080]  Now it's not a rewrite of the original.
[39:26.080 --> 39:29.080]  The original's in there just as I wrote it in 64.
[39:29.080 --> 39:33.080]  But what I do is to bring it up to date with the shenanigans
[39:33.080 --> 39:37.080]  and the behind-the-closed-door deals that were made
[39:37.080 --> 39:42.080]  in all the Republican National Convention after 1964.
[39:42.080 --> 39:44.080]  Brings it right up to date.
[39:44.080 --> 39:47.080]  And I'm telling listeners, you can't be a player
[39:47.080 --> 39:50.080]  in the presidential election next year unless you know the history
[39:50.080 --> 39:52.080]  and unless you know what's in the past.
[39:52.080 --> 39:57.080]  Because we want to pick somebody who's picked by the grassroots.
[39:57.080 --> 40:02.080]  We don't want somebody who wants to bring in all this cheap labor
[40:02.080 --> 40:08.080]  and export our good jobs abroad to cheap labor countries.
[40:08.080 --> 40:11.080]  And so it's a big challenge.
[40:11.080 --> 40:15.080]  But you need to know the history in order to get going in the battle.
[40:15.080 --> 40:19.080]  I agree, Phyllis, the founder of the Eagle Form, Phyllis Lafley, is our guest.
[40:19.080 --> 40:22.080]  I want to bring up some inside baseball stories here.
[40:22.080 --> 40:26.080]  I've been told by high-level folks that at the nomination process,
[40:26.080 --> 40:31.080]  for the 1980 election, and I've seen the speeches
[40:31.080 --> 40:36.080]  and seen video clips where Ronald Reagan was criticizing George Herbert Walker Bush
[40:36.080 --> 40:39.080]  and saying he's a trilateralist, he's a globalist,
[40:39.080 --> 40:42.080]  basically going with a very goldwater line of reality.
[40:42.080 --> 40:45.080]  And then he was taken behind closed doors and said,
[40:45.080 --> 40:49.080]  we're not going to back you if you don't put Bush in here,
[40:49.080 --> 40:53.080]  who was a Rockefeller East Coast Republican,
[40:53.080 --> 40:57.080]  and then you have the Clinton dynasty and the Bush that is working together.
[40:57.080 --> 41:00.080]  I was always told at the time that Bush had basically fallen down on the election,
[41:00.080 --> 41:02.080]  so Clinton could get in.
[41:02.080 --> 41:04.080]  Now they call him another son.
[41:04.080 --> 41:05.080]  That's basically been admitted.
[41:05.080 --> 41:09.080]  Now we're back to more Clinton and Bush dynasties.
[41:09.080 --> 41:13.080]  Well, let me say, Alex, the story of what they tried to do to Reagan
[41:13.080 --> 41:17.080]  when they realized he was going to be nominated is told
[41:17.080 --> 41:23.080]  in my new book, A Choice Not An Echo, and it's quite behind the same story.
[41:23.080 --> 41:29.080]  What they tried to do was to make Gerald Ford co-president.
[41:29.080 --> 41:32.080]  And when Dan rather accosted me on the floor of the convention,
[41:32.080 --> 41:34.080]  he said, what do you think about this, Mrs. Lathley?
[41:34.080 --> 41:37.080]  And I said, well, it's completely unconstitutional.
[41:37.080 --> 41:40.080]  You want to give the vice president control of the budget, the money,
[41:40.080 --> 41:48.080]  our sovereignty issues, our tax issues, and leave the president to Reagan
[41:48.080 --> 41:50.080]  with nothing but the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
[41:50.080 --> 41:51.080]  Well, let's stop right there.
[41:51.080 --> 41:52.080]  This is such a big deal.
[41:52.080 --> 41:56.080]  You're confirming when I was told when I was, you know, a kid
[41:56.080 --> 41:59.080]  and when I've talked to high-level Republicans that were there,
[41:59.080 --> 42:01.080]  you were there on record on national television.
[42:01.080 --> 42:02.080]  You were behind the scenes.
[42:02.080 --> 42:05.080]  The establishment was so afraid of Reagan
[42:05.080 --> 42:10.080]  that they were trying to get him to agree to be a titular head
[42:10.080 --> 42:15.080]  and try to change the Constitution illegally inside the party,
[42:15.080 --> 42:17.080]  break down exactly what happened.
[42:17.080 --> 42:18.080]  It's sensational.
[42:18.080 --> 42:22.080]  Well, tell the story of my new edition of A Choice Not An Echo.
[42:22.080 --> 42:25.080]  But they wanted to give all the real power to the vice president,
[42:25.080 --> 42:26.080]  who would be Gerald Ford.
[42:26.080 --> 42:30.080]  And the reason they wanted Gerald Ford was that he was the man
[42:30.080 --> 42:32.080]  who took his orders from Henry Kissinger.
[42:32.080 --> 42:37.080]  And they thought that that would enable him to run the country
[42:37.080 --> 42:40.080]  even if Reagan were elected president.
[42:40.080 --> 42:46.080]  And that is why Reagan was pounded so heavily by them
[42:46.080 --> 42:51.080]  that he called George Bush at 1125 that night.
[42:51.080 --> 42:55.080]  And I was there in the convention hall at 1125 and said,
[42:55.080 --> 42:56.080]  get on over here.
[42:56.080 --> 42:58.080]  Bush was already in his pajamas.
[42:58.080 --> 43:00.080]  He had given up any hope of being on the ticket.
[43:00.080 --> 43:03.080]  And Reagan brought him over and introduced Bush
[43:03.080 --> 43:06.080]  because he was afraid he couldn't get through the night.
[43:06.080 --> 43:10.080]  You know, Walter Cronkite from the Skybox had already announced
[43:10.080 --> 43:14.080]  that Gerald Ford was going to be the co-president
[43:14.080 --> 43:17.080]  and have the real power.
[43:17.080 --> 43:21.080]  So the elites were just struggling to get their people in.
[43:21.080 --> 43:25.080]  And so George Herbert Walker Bush was seen as a better person
[43:25.080 --> 43:28.080]  for him to choose than Gerald Ford.
[43:28.080 --> 43:30.080]  Oh, yeah, Bush, sure.
[43:30.080 --> 43:35.080]  But the first George Bush was the choice of the establishment.
[43:35.080 --> 43:36.080]  No question about that.
[43:36.080 --> 43:39.080]  And the grassroots were for Ronald Reagan.
[43:39.080 --> 43:44.080]  And then we had enough delegates to nominate Reagan,
[43:44.080 --> 43:49.080]  but the establishment of the so-called kingmakers
[43:49.080 --> 43:53.080]  cooked up this deal by which they thought they could take
[43:53.080 --> 43:55.080]  the power away from the president
[43:55.080 --> 43:59.080]  and give it to a vice president they could control.
[43:59.080 --> 44:00.080]  It's amazing, though.
[44:00.080 --> 44:05.080]  So we learned that Ronald Reagan really was anti-New World Order,
[44:05.080 --> 44:06.080]  anti-globalist.
[44:06.080 --> 44:07.080]  Oh, sure.
[44:07.080 --> 44:10.080]  But then he gets shot.
[44:10.080 --> 44:13.080]  And then he goes in for treatment and comes back out.
[44:13.080 --> 44:15.080]  I know you were in both administrations.
[44:15.080 --> 44:19.080]  What can you say about what happened inside of those administrations?
[44:19.080 --> 44:21.080]  Well, Reagan wasn't perfect,
[44:21.080 --> 44:24.080]  but he certainly was better than anybody else in sight.
[44:24.080 --> 44:27.080]  And he was the choice of the grassroots.
[44:27.080 --> 44:33.080]  And he did not turn over all his power to Ford or anybody else.
[44:33.080 --> 44:38.080]  And, yes, he made a number of mistakes that we could discuss.
[44:38.080 --> 44:43.080]  But, however, on balance, he was the best president we had.
[44:43.080 --> 44:46.080]  You're saying, bottom line, he was a good guy that loved this country.
[44:46.080 --> 44:47.080]  He did.
[44:47.080 --> 44:48.080]  He did.
[44:48.080 --> 44:51.080]  That's a big difference from Obama, who obviously wants to destroy it.
[44:51.080 --> 44:53.080]  Well, he obviously doesn't love this country.
[44:53.080 --> 44:56.080]  He doesn't want to think we're better than anybody else.
[44:56.080 --> 44:58.080]  And, of course, we are.
[44:58.080 --> 45:00.080]  That's why everybody in the world wants to come here.
[45:00.080 --> 45:04.080]  Well, our ideals were better, and we certainly were exceptional.
[45:04.080 --> 45:08.080]  Now we're an exceptional paradox of just horrible socialist and crony capitalist
[45:08.080 --> 45:11.080]  and then all the other free market folks making this country go.
[45:11.080 --> 45:14.080]  Why do you think the Democrats are so arrogant now
[45:14.080 --> 45:18.080]  and admit they're lying and admit they want to wreck the economy
[45:18.080 --> 45:20.080]  and saying you didn't build your business?
[45:20.080 --> 45:22.080]  I mean, that's a way to discredit themselves.
[45:22.080 --> 45:24.080]  Are they that disconnected?
[45:24.080 --> 45:28.080]  Well, they have a lot of rich people,
[45:28.080 --> 45:33.080]  and they've always had more money than the grassroots movement.
[45:33.080 --> 45:34.080]  Oh, yeah.
[45:34.080 --> 45:39.080]  And I think they were doing a bit of gloating,
[45:39.080 --> 45:44.080]  but they simply want to continue to control things.
[45:44.080 --> 45:45.080]  They always have.
[45:45.080 --> 45:48.080]  And I'm telling the people listening to this program,
[45:48.080 --> 45:52.080]  we beat them in 1964 when we nominated Goldwater,
[45:52.080 --> 45:56.080]  and we beat them in 1980 and 84 when we nominated Ronald Reagan,
[45:56.080 --> 45:59.080]  and we can do it again if you'll get with it.
[45:59.080 --> 46:02.080]  Read my books so you know the shenanigans they built before,
[46:02.080 --> 46:07.080]  and we won't let them get by with giving us another loser for president this time.
[46:07.080 --> 46:10.080]  Well, I've never seen the establishment this scared,
[46:10.080 --> 46:12.080]  and I've gone back through the history,
[46:12.080 --> 46:14.080]  and I want to see if you concur with that.
[46:14.080 --> 46:16.080]  They are really scared of the Tea Party insurrection
[46:16.080 --> 46:18.080]  over the Republicans.
[46:18.080 --> 46:20.080]  They are absolutely lining up against it,
[46:20.080 --> 46:23.080]  but I'm seeing a lot of good signs of major talk show hosts
[46:23.080 --> 46:25.080]  realizing that and now saying that.
[46:25.080 --> 46:28.080]  And what do you expect them to pull now
[46:28.080 --> 46:34.080]  to try to get a Chris Christie or a Jeb Bush over a Rand Paul or a Ted Cruz?
[46:34.080 --> 46:38.080]  What do you expect them to pull A and then B,
[46:38.080 --> 46:41.080]  as probably the top expert on the inside stuff that goes on,
[46:41.080 --> 46:42.080]  you know, seeing it for 50 years,
[46:42.080 --> 46:46.080]  fellow Schlafly joins us, head of the Eagle Forum,
[46:46.080 --> 46:47.080]  who would you like to see as president?
[46:47.080 --> 46:50.080]  Well, I'm not picking my guy at the present time,
[46:50.080 --> 46:54.080]  but I can tell you it's pretty clear that their number one guy is Jeb Bush.
[46:54.080 --> 46:55.080]  Yeah.
[46:55.080 --> 47:00.080]  You know, they believe that the British system of primogeniture,
[47:00.080 --> 47:02.080]  they want to take the next one in line,
[47:02.080 --> 47:05.080]  and it's just the next one in line, there's been one loser after another.
[47:05.080 --> 47:08.080]  I don't believe the American people are willing to elect another Bush.
[47:08.080 --> 47:11.080]  Yeah, we rejected royalty in 1776.
[47:11.080 --> 47:12.080]  We did.
[47:12.080 --> 47:17.080]  And so the grassroots can do it.
[47:17.080 --> 47:23.080]  They'll get on out and realize that the fight is in the Republican Party.
[47:23.080 --> 47:25.080]  That's where the important fight is.
[47:25.080 --> 47:30.080]  Now, we lost several good candidates, including my own candidate for state rep,
[47:30.080 --> 47:37.080]  by the libertarian votes that took more than his margin by which he lost.
[47:37.080 --> 47:44.080]  And maybe you wish we had many parties like other countries do.
[47:44.080 --> 47:46.080]  I don't wish that, but some people may.
[47:46.080 --> 47:47.080]  Yeah.
[47:47.080 --> 47:49.080]  But we have a two-party system.
[47:49.080 --> 47:50.080]  Well, I've clearly said-
[47:50.080 --> 47:52.080]  Well, I've clearly said you go to war with the army you have,
[47:52.080 --> 47:54.080]  not the army you wish you had.
[47:54.080 --> 47:55.080]  Well, I agree.
[47:55.080 --> 47:58.080]  I vote libertarian when both candidates are bad,
[47:58.080 --> 48:03.080]  but I said in this election, if there's a Tea Party patriot running against a Democrat,
[48:03.080 --> 48:06.080]  and even if they're not perfect, you've got to vote for them,
[48:06.080 --> 48:08.080]  because this is a referendum on tyranny.
[48:08.080 --> 48:10.080]  We have to bring them down.
[48:10.080 --> 48:11.080]  We have to bloody their nose.
[48:11.080 --> 48:13.080]  We have to make them pay.
[48:13.080 --> 48:15.080]  We've got to take over-
[48:15.080 --> 48:16.080]  We did a pretty good job.
[48:16.080 --> 48:17.080]  Yeah.
[48:17.080 --> 48:18.080]  We did a pretty good job.
[48:18.080 --> 48:19.080]  I was really proud of it.
[48:19.080 --> 48:25.080]  We did get everybody, but we got an awful lot and a lot more than they expect us to get.
[48:25.080 --> 48:27.080]  Well, Phyllis, it's just amazing.
[48:27.080 --> 48:31.080]  I want to have you back on again soon, just to talk about the book for a full hour.
[48:31.080 --> 48:33.080]  I want to go to a few phone calls.
[48:33.080 --> 48:39.080]  Yeah, because I've got so many good inside stories, and it's up to date,
[48:39.080 --> 48:44.080]  and you've got to have the ammo if you're going to go to battle.
[48:44.080 --> 48:45.080]  Wow.
[48:45.080 --> 48:50.080]  And the ammo is a choice, not an echo, new 50th anniversary edition.
[48:50.080 --> 48:54.080]  Well, I want to talk to the publisher, maybe carry it at the info or store as well.
[48:54.080 --> 48:55.080]  I can't wait to read it.
[48:55.080 --> 48:57.080]  I mean, I read the original book, but I haven't.
[48:57.080 --> 48:58.080]  That was like 15 years ago.
[48:58.080 --> 49:02.080]  I want to read this updated, expanded version.
[49:02.080 --> 49:06.080]  Phyllis, our guest, I want to go to a few phone calls here when we come back from break,
[49:06.080 --> 49:08.080]  but maybe we'll skip this network break for time.
[49:08.080 --> 49:13.080]  But Phyllis, anything else you'd like to add to the viewers and listeners out there?
[49:13.080 --> 49:18.080]  Well, what's in the book is the inside story, like that 1980 behind the scenes story
[49:18.080 --> 49:20.080]  of what they tried to do with Reagan.
[49:20.080 --> 49:25.080]  It's just simply incredible, and it shows you how these people operate,
[49:25.080 --> 49:29.080]  and they've got the power and the clout, and they do a lot.
[49:29.080 --> 49:32.080]  But I think people are waking up to that.
[49:32.080 --> 49:38.080]  You know, at the present time, what they're trying to do is to give Obama more power
[49:38.080 --> 49:40.080]  than the previous presidents ever had.
[49:40.080 --> 49:44.080]  They want to give him fast track so he can make any deal with foreign countries
[49:44.080 --> 49:47.080]  and not even let Congress know.
[49:47.080 --> 49:49.080]  Make a deal and make it into the law.
[49:49.080 --> 49:51.080]  It's called fast track.
[49:51.080 --> 49:53.080]  Why would we give him any more power?
[49:53.080 --> 49:55.080]  Both by mind.
[49:55.080 --> 49:56.080]  That's right.
[49:56.080 --> 50:00.080]  In fact, I've seen some Rand Paul statements where he's like,
[50:00.080 --> 50:03.080]  we need to get trade done, and he needs to clarify that,
[50:03.080 --> 50:05.080]  because that's what the other Republicans are saying.
[50:05.080 --> 50:07.080]  It means give him the power.
[50:07.080 --> 50:11.080]  He's been given a mandate to be indicted, to be impeached,
[50:11.080 --> 50:14.080]  not a mandate to expand power.
[50:14.080 --> 50:16.080]  The mandate is repeal Obamacare.
[50:16.080 --> 50:21.080]  Phyllis, what's going to happen if the neocons and rhinos are able to suppress
[50:21.080 --> 50:25.080]  the Liberty Movement and the Republican Party, and if they don't repeal Obamacare?
[50:25.080 --> 50:27.080]  If they don't, shut the president down.
[50:27.080 --> 50:29.080]  If they let him shut down more power plants?
[50:29.080 --> 50:31.080]  If they let him have executive amnesty?
[50:31.080 --> 50:34.080]  I mean, if they do that, what's going to happen?
[50:34.080 --> 50:37.080]  Well, I'm making up my mind that's not going to happen.
[50:37.080 --> 50:43.080]  And we've got to educate the grassroots and tell them that they have the power
[50:43.080 --> 50:45.080]  if they will only use it.
[50:45.080 --> 50:48.080]  That's what we're up against today, because a lot of people,
[50:48.080 --> 50:52.080]  you realize that not many people could remember 1964 now.
[50:52.080 --> 50:59.080]  And we need to tell them that we are a country of we the people.
[50:59.080 --> 51:01.080]  I'll say this about Barry Goldwater.
[51:01.080 --> 51:05.080]  I mean, nobody was talking about New World Order and trilateral commissions
[51:05.080 --> 51:08.080]  and, you know, just all this stuff back when he was.
[51:08.080 --> 51:11.080]  He was doing it when it was like speaking Martian,
[51:11.080 --> 51:13.080]  because he really cared and was warning people.
[51:13.080 --> 51:15.080]  He was being the opposite of a politician.
[51:15.080 --> 51:17.080]  He was being a statesman and studying the two.
[51:17.080 --> 51:21.080]  Though Reagan was probably more well-spoken and maybe better looking,
[51:21.080 --> 51:24.080]  Barry Goldwater would have been an incredible president.
[51:24.080 --> 51:27.080]  Yes, he was an authentic conservative.
[51:27.080 --> 51:29.080]  And that's what we want.
[51:29.080 --> 51:33.080]  Somebody who really cares about this country and believes our country
[51:33.080 --> 51:35.080]  should be the best and the biggest.
[51:35.080 --> 51:39.080]  One of the things that I have been responsible for repeatedly putting
[51:39.080 --> 51:43.080]  in the Republican policy platform adopted at the Republican Convention
[51:43.080 --> 51:47.080]  is that we need military superiority.
[51:47.080 --> 51:49.080]  It's not enough to be just strong.
[51:49.080 --> 51:52.080]  We've got to be the biggest of the best.
[51:52.080 --> 51:57.080]  And that's the best key to peace for ourselves and for everybody else.
[51:57.080 --> 52:02.080]  Well, it would be if we didn't have neocons in Obama launching all these wars.
[52:02.080 --> 52:04.080]  That's why people want to cut the military.
[52:04.080 --> 52:08.080]  My concern is they're trying to twist the military into a domestic force
[52:08.080 --> 52:10.080]  with all those memos to go after the Tea Party.
[52:10.080 --> 52:12.080]  Do you find that chilling?
[52:12.080 --> 52:16.080]  Yes, and I also find it chilling that they're putting women in combat.
[52:16.080 --> 52:20.080]  I don't have any respect for the military who's been women in the combat.
[52:20.080 --> 52:24.080]  It's kind of like if you hear noise in your house in the middle of the night
[52:24.080 --> 52:26.080]  and the husband turns over and says,
[52:26.080 --> 52:29.080]  honey, you go on downstairs and see what's going on.
[52:29.080 --> 52:31.080]  Well, it's a war on reality.
[52:31.080 --> 52:35.080]  I mean, men can't make babies and men are ugly and women look good.
[52:35.080 --> 52:37.080]  I mean, there are differences.
[52:37.080 --> 52:39.080]  The job of the man is to protect their family.
[52:39.080 --> 52:40.080]  Exactly.
[52:40.080 --> 52:41.080]  It's men's jobs.
[52:41.080 --> 52:45.080]  I mean, at least the men I know want to protect their family.
[52:45.080 --> 52:46.080]  Sure they do.
[52:46.080 --> 52:53.080]  That's why recent figures show that men who have children
[52:53.080 --> 52:55.080]  earn more money than men who don't.
[52:55.080 --> 52:57.080]  Well, that's just because they work harder.
[52:57.080 --> 52:59.080]  They've got a motive.
[52:59.080 --> 53:03.080]  Well, the minute my wife had our first child, my son,
[53:03.080 --> 53:05.080]  it just clicked.
[53:05.080 --> 53:08.080]  Everything in me, I suddenly wanted to be more successful,
[53:08.080 --> 53:12.080]  wanted to work harder, grew up a lot, and it's biological.
[53:12.080 --> 53:13.080]  Yes.
[53:13.080 --> 53:15.080]  And we need to encourage that.
[53:15.080 --> 53:18.080]  And of course, you're fighting the feminists,
[53:18.080 --> 53:21.080]  but you need to read my other book, Who Killed the American Family,
[53:21.080 --> 53:23.080]  and you'll see the damage that the feminists did.
[53:23.080 --> 53:24.080]  I have read that book.
[53:24.080 --> 53:26.080]  I want to have you back on in a few weeks,
[53:26.080 --> 53:28.080]  so you'll do it just on that book as well.
[53:28.080 --> 53:31.080]  Phyllis Schlafly's our guest, Randy in Texas.
[53:31.080 --> 53:33.080]  Randy, you're on the air.
[53:33.080 --> 53:34.080]  Go ahead.
[53:34.080 --> 53:35.080]  Thank you, Alex.
[53:35.080 --> 53:39.080]  Phyllis, you are God sent.
[53:39.080 --> 53:45.080]  I went to a program the other evening where John Banforth was the speaker.
[53:45.080 --> 53:48.080]  I know you know John probably very well.
[53:48.080 --> 53:50.080]  I'd like you to speak about him a little bit,
[53:50.080 --> 53:54.080]  but let me just tell you one thing that he said that was very disturbing to me.
[53:54.080 --> 54:02.080]  He told me point blank that his wife campaigned and raised funds
[54:02.080 --> 54:05.080]  for Mark Pryor in Arkansas.
[54:05.080 --> 54:10.080]  If that is going on Republican to Democrat,
[54:10.080 --> 54:13.080]  something is grossly wrong in this country.
[54:13.080 --> 54:17.080]  And I'd like you to address what you believe that Mr. Danforth's position
[54:17.080 --> 54:21.080]  really is on the Republican Party and conservatism in general.
[54:21.080 --> 54:25.080]  Well, stop surprising because we in Missouri, I live in Missouri,
[54:25.080 --> 54:28.080]  consider him part of the establishment crowd.
[54:28.080 --> 54:33.080]  And this fight we've been talking about in the National Republican Party
[54:33.080 --> 54:37.080]  between the establishment and the grassroots goes on in a different state.
[54:37.080 --> 54:42.080]  And in Missouri, Danforth is definitely in the establishment crowd.
[54:42.080 --> 54:47.080]  Now, I'm happy to tell you that in the last election for Missouri State Chairman,
[54:47.080 --> 54:50.080]  we elected a grass-rooter.
[54:50.080 --> 54:52.080]  We elected a real conservative.
[54:52.080 --> 54:54.080]  And you know, it's kind of funny.
[54:54.080 --> 55:00.080]  Missouri has a pretty slick system for electing the state chairman.
[55:00.080 --> 55:02.080]  It's kind of like the way they elect the pope.
[55:02.080 --> 55:06.080]  They had a secret ballot and somebody counts the ballots
[55:06.080 --> 55:09.080]  and Ed Martin won by about three or four votes
[55:09.080 --> 55:12.080]  and then they immediately take the ballot out and burn them.
[55:12.080 --> 55:15.080]  That's the way the pope, they do for the pope, you know,
[55:15.080 --> 55:18.080]  and the vote goes up and then the people vote has been a new pope.
[55:18.080 --> 55:22.080]  Well, anyway, we got a conservative, a non-establishment guy.
[55:22.080 --> 55:26.080]  And you can do that in your state and get your grass-rooters
[55:26.080 --> 55:30.080]  elected as delegates to the Republican National Convention.
[55:30.080 --> 55:33.080]  Very exciting. We're almost out of time. Thank you so much, Randy.
[55:33.080 --> 55:35.080]  I'll see if Phil's going to do five more and to overdrive.
[55:35.080 --> 55:37.080]  Paul Watson's coming on overdrive into the next hour.
[55:37.080 --> 55:39.080]  I got Paul Watson coming on with huge breaking news.
[55:39.080 --> 55:42.080]  I'm trying to get as many as these calls as possible.
[55:42.080 --> 55:46.080]  I think the Democrats have jumped the shark in that they just openly say
[55:46.080 --> 55:48.080]  we're criminals, we're liars, ah-ha-ha.
[55:48.080 --> 55:51.080]  I believe they've gone insane like Nero.
[55:51.080 --> 55:54.080]  And we've got a real chance to beat them now, folks.
[55:54.080 --> 55:58.080]  They've had so much power that they've acted like lunatics
[55:58.080 --> 56:01.080]  and the Republicans that have worked with them are going to be exposed.
[56:01.080 --> 56:04.080]  If we take this initiative, I believe we can take the country back.
[56:04.080 --> 56:06.080]  Phyllis, what do you say to that?
[56:06.080 --> 56:09.080]  Yes, I do. I absolutely do believe.
[56:09.080 --> 56:13.080]  And not only that, we must. Our future depends on it.
[56:13.080 --> 56:16.080]  Let's go ahead and go to my website, egofarm.org.
[56:16.080 --> 56:20.080]  Let's go to Patrick in Texas. Patrick here on the ear. Go ahead.
[56:20.080 --> 56:25.080]  Hey, Alex. I was pleasure listening to you. Hi, Phyllis.
[56:25.080 --> 56:32.080]  Hi. I was a fan of Reagan when I found out that he tried to get rid of the Federal Reserve.
[56:32.080 --> 56:35.080]  And I think that's why they tried to murder him.
[56:35.080 --> 56:37.080]  And the IRS.
[56:37.080 --> 56:42.080]  Yeah, and the IRS. And also, as far as business is creating jobs,
[56:42.080 --> 56:46.080]  the one thing that I think about is the public.
[56:46.080 --> 56:50.080]  They're the man for a product, and then the bank's allowing the public to get money
[56:50.080 --> 56:54.080]  in order to make these products and actually start entrepreneurship.
[56:54.080 --> 56:58.080]  It doesn't happen, and that's the biggest enemy we have are the banks.
[56:58.080 --> 57:02.080]  Well, the central banks that are waging war on the regular banks, I agree with you, Phyllis.
[57:02.080 --> 57:05.080]  Who is the biggest enemy in corporate America?
[57:05.080 --> 57:08.080]  You mentioned Chamber of Commerce, all these groups.
[57:08.080 --> 57:12.080]  The unions vote for open borders. They vote for NAFTA and GATT.
[57:12.080 --> 57:16.080]  I mean, it's just all these special interests are controlled by who?
[57:16.080 --> 57:19.080]  Well, I don't know that they're all controlled by anybody,
[57:19.080 --> 57:24.080]  but certainly all these groups are pushing for open borders,
[57:24.080 --> 57:29.080]  and we shouldn't let them get by with it because the majority of people don't want that.
[57:29.080 --> 57:34.080]  And what they just want is to achieve labor. That's what it's for.
[57:34.080 --> 57:40.080]  And we should reform the laws that are encouraging businesses to send their good jobs overseas.
[57:40.080 --> 57:44.080]  It's just awful. Free trade is such a deceit.
[57:44.080 --> 57:49.080]  Because they ride at one side. I've got a little five-minute segment here coming up in about a minute at the break.
[57:49.080 --> 57:51.080]  Can you do it? If you can't, I've got one more question.
[57:51.080 --> 57:54.080]  No. No, I have to go have another.
[57:54.080 --> 57:56.080]  I understand. I know you're a hard worker.
[57:56.080 --> 57:59.080]  Well, then here's my question. We'll have to take calls on their time.
[57:59.080 --> 58:03.080]  Can't feminists now see that what they were sold as feminism doesn't empower women
[58:03.080 --> 58:08.080]  and is actually really screwed up women's position and everybody's position?
[58:08.080 --> 58:10.080]  I mean, isn't feminism in trouble?
[58:10.080 --> 58:14.080]  But we can discuss that the next time I come on your show.
[58:14.080 --> 58:18.080]  All right. Well, thank you so much for joining us, Phyllis Schlafly.
[58:18.080 --> 58:19.080]  Okay. Bye, Alex.
[58:19.080 --> 58:21.080]  All right. Very interesting lady, folks.
[58:21.080 --> 58:26.080]  I'm telling you, she really is at the heart of what you see with the Tea Party Liberty Movement.
[58:26.080 --> 58:31.080]  You name it today, battling the Republican Rockefeller blue bloods.
[58:31.080 --> 58:35.080]  And I mean, they would have totally taken over. It wasn't for folks like her.
[58:35.080 --> 58:39.080]  All right. I'm going to go to a few of your calls that miss talking to her when we come.
[58:39.080 --> 58:42.080]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[58:42.080 --> 59:10.080]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[59:13.080 --> 59:16.080]  This time I doubled down and got even more.
[59:16.080 --> 59:20.080]  As of me taping this on the eve of Thanksgiving, we have already sold half of them.
[59:20.080 --> 59:22.080]  So instead of keeping the price at its regular discounted price,
[59:22.080 --> 59:27.080]  we are going to give you 20% off and free shipping on single bottles.
[59:27.080 --> 59:30.080]  But if you get four bottles, we're going to give you the fifth one free and the free shipping.
[59:30.080 --> 59:32.080]  I don't know how long this special will run,
[59:32.080 --> 59:35.080]  but if supplies last, we will extend it out until Cyber Monday.
[59:35.080 --> 59:40.080]  You'll find powerful nutraceuticals like Silver Bullet and others at infowarslife.com
[59:40.080 --> 59:43.080]  All until three 888-253-3139.
[59:43.080 --> 59:47.080]  Again, this is Alex Jones, wishing you all a blessed and happy Thanksgiving
[59:47.080 --> 01:00:11.080]  and wishing you all for your support of freedom.
[01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:27.080]  Welcome to GCNLive from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:33.080]  Touchdown. Jubilation is the Rosetta mission is a success.
[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:39.080]  Landing on a comet traveling 34,000 miles per hour towards the sun.
[01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:42.080]  That's the stuff dreams are made of.
[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:47.080]  We got Freely Ricky Ross, the biggest coke dealer probably in U.S. history,
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:53.080]  ever quote busted joining us to blow the history of CIA drug trafficking wide open.
[01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:55.080]  Of course, the big movie, Kill the Messenger.
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:59.080]  Guys, give me the IMDB printout on that please.
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:06.080]  Also portrays Ross in it, and he's here with us in Austin, Texas
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:10.080]  before he goes to speak to some college students up in Dallas.
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:13.080]  And we're going to be, I've been talking to him since he was in prison.
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:17.080]  He's been in prison 25 years, but he's going to be in studio with us.
[01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:19.080]  I haven't even met him yet. He came in last night.
[01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:21.080]  He's been out with the crew. He just arrived.
[01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:27.080]  And so he'll be in studio with us coming up in the next segment.
[01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:32.080]  Well, breaking the U.S. and China just announced a huge deal on climate.
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:37.080]  You mean a huge tax deal like Obamacare or the plan to take over the Internet
[01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:41.080]  and tax it and regulate it to protect it. Obamacare for the Internet.
[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:46.080]  A huge disease. He's getting ready on the Internet, on carbon taxes, on your guns.
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:52.080]  With the UN treaty, he says he'll honor that goes in December 24th, a little Christmas present.
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:56.080]  Wide open borders going after your guns, going after your energy prices,
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:02:00.080]  going after you with carbon taxes, going after you, going after you, going after you,
[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:05.080]  going after fast track to sign over sovereignty, Republican leadership involved in that.
[01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:11.080]  The U.S. and China just announced a huge deal on climate. Yeah.
[01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:14.080]  And it's a game changer, Mother Jones reports.
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:20.080]  Oh, yes. The surprise agreement, you mean the sneak attack,
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:26.080]  aims to double the price of carbon pollution reduction in the United States only.
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:30.080]  What a great deal. You make it harder to work and have factories here
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:33.080]  and force it over to China that always signs on.
[01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:37.080]  You comply. Dirty coal power plants, three being built a week.
[01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:40.080]  We have more than three being shut down a week, clean ones.
[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:43.080]  What a day Q Obama.
[01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:48.080]  Wow, our electricity already cost five times what it does in China.
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:52.080]  And so no wonder no one wants to bill. Thank you. Yeah.
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:57.080]  Let's make it 10 times. Oh, man, Obama, what a great deal.
[01:02:57.080 --> 01:03:02.080]  Make our energy 10 times more expensive than Chinese coal power energy.
[01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:05.080]  And the average American goes, I don't own coal stocks.
[01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:07.080]  I don't have a coal stove.
[01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:11.080]  All you electric car people with your vaults and all of you that are like,
[01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:13.080]  look at that gasoline, gasoline truck.
[01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:16.080]  And you got your electric lawnmowers.
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:23.080]  It comes from coal, coal, coal, coal, coal, coal.
[01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:28.080]  I mean, this is like a bandit blowing the race car engine before the race.
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:31.080]  Obama's driving the Chinese race car and he comes over
[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:33.080]  and like throws a hand grenade in the engine.
[01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:37.080]  We go, oh, thank you. The engine's boom blows up.
[01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:40.080]  He's like, wait, that the engine didn't totally blow.
[01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:43.080]  Throw an Obamacare hand grenade in there.
[01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:46.080]  Bringing 60 million illegals to bankrupt things.
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:48.080]  Another hand grenade.
[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:51.080]  The thing is the country was so rich and so powerful,
[01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:53.080]  they just can't blow the engine.
[01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:55.080]  You filth.
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:58.080]  And we've got 60 million people refusing to pay the income tax,
[01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:01.080]  and the economy going. It's meant to shut it off.
[01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:04.080]  Oh, you filth. You trash. You scum.
[01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:07.080]  I mean, this country's under total attack.
[01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:09.080]  In a surprise announcement last night,
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:12.080]  the world's two biggest economies in greenhouse gas emitters,
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:14.080]  United States has shut it, said they will partner closely
[01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:17.080]  on broad-ranging package of plans to fight climate change,
[01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:19.080]  including new targets to reduce carbon pollution,
[01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:22.080]  according to the statement from the White House.
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:25.080]  But it's going to start out with doubling the price in the U.S.
[01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:28.080]  because we're the leader in that. Look at Obama smiling.
[01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:31.080]  Can you imagine? Oh, because they don't just cut the power off.
[01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:33.080]  They then charge you more for it.
[01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:40.080]  All right, folks, we're going to go to break now.
[01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:46.080]  And when we return, freeway Ricky Ross,
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:49.080]  the real Rick Ross in studio.
[01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:53.080]  I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com, prisonplanet.tv,
[01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:56.080]  follow us on Twitter, Real Alex Jones. Stay with us.
[01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:26.080]  We've been unprecedented 20% off and free shipping
[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:29.080]  on all Silver Bullet across the board while supplies last,
[01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:32.080]  and to help everyone stock up for the next shortage.
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:34.080]  When you buy four bottles of Silver Bullet,
[01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:37.080]  you'll receive the fifth one absolutely free.
[01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:40.080]  That's on top of the 20% off savings and free shipping.
[01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:44.080]  Finally, if supplies hold, we will extend the special out to Cyber Monday.
[01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:47.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've never done anything like this before.
[01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:49.080]  Find this mother of all specials
[01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:51.080]  and others I've not yet announced yet
[01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:58.080]  at infowarsstore.com or call 888-253-3139 at infowarsstore.com.
[01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:25.080]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:29.080]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:31.080]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:33.080]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round,
[01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:36.080]  including hollow points and 308 sniper rounds.
[01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:39.080]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal.
[01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:41.080]  But for how long?
[01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:44.080]  Go to infidelbodyarmor.com, spelled I-N-S,
[01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:51.080]  I-D-E-L, body armor dot com.
[01:06:51.080 --> 01:07:19.080]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:23.080]  I'm talking about Silver Bullet Loyal Silver that we've been sold out of for months.
[01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:25.080]  This time, I doubled down and got even more.
[01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:29.080]  As of me taping this on the eve of Thanksgiving, we have already sold half of it.
[01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:32.080]  So instead of keeping the price at its regular discounted price,
[01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:36.080]  we are going to give you 20% off and free shipping on single bottles.
[01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:40.080]  But if you get four bottles, we're going to give you the fifth one free and the free shipping.
[01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:42.080]  I don't know how long this special will run,
[01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:45.080]  but if supplies last, we will extend it out until Cyber Monday.
[01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:49.080]  Find powerful nutraceuticals like Silver Bullet and others at infowarslife.com
[01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:52.080]  or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:56.080]  Again, this is Alex Jones, wishing you all a blessed and happy Thanksgiving
[01:07:56.080 --> 01:08:23.080]  and thanking you all for your support of freedom.
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:42.080]  All right folks, we're broadcasting worldwide now into the second hour.
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:46.080]  Coming up in the third hour, we're going to open the phones up for listeners.
[01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:51.080]  Your chance to talk to freeway Ricky Ross.
[01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:58.080]  And of course, Rick Ross has been recognized as a major pawn of the CIA drug war game.
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:01.080]  He was a pioneer in the crack cocaine trade in Los Angeles.
[01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:06.080]  Ross harvested millions of dollars a day as an unknown participant of the CIA
[01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:09.080]  and U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency ops.
[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:13.080]  And then long after he got out of it, they still set him up and sent him to prison.
[01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:18.080]  And here's my issue.
[01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:23.080]  It's the government that made narcotics illegal when prohibition ended of alcohol
[01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:26.080]  because they needed another business to skim off of. That's on record.
[01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:30.080]  They've been shipping the narcotics into this country since they made them illegal.
[01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:36.080]  You could buy cocaine, heroin, speed anything under different names at the drugstore.
[01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:42.080]  You would go and get cocaine syrup shot into your quote tonic.
[01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:44.080]  That's where soft drinks came from.
[01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:49.080]  I know I had family that basically worked in that business up in Waco
[01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:53.080]  where Dr. Pepper comes from. It had cocaine in it too.
[01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:56.080]  In fact, one of my ancestors actually named Dr. Pepper.
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:59.080]  The point is, Dr. will pep you up.
[01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:02.080]  So this guy's been a Dr. Pepper as well.
[01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:06.080]  You make it illegal though. It brings all the prostitution.
[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:08.080]  It brings all the money laundering.
[01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:13.080]  It brings all the exploitation into it and makes it dirty.
[01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:16.080]  And how are you going to legalize slavery again in this country?
[01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:20.080]  How are you going to scoop up 3, 4, 5 million people and throw them in jail every year
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:22.080]  and take their rights away?
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:24.080]  You do it by putting something highly addictive.
[01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:26.080]  Beer's addictive. We're going to lock them up for that.
[01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:29.080]  Fast food's addictive. We're going to lock you up for that.
[01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:31.080]  They throw it out.
[01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:37.080]  I hope people pick up the adulterated poison filled with all sorts of toxic garbage.
[01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:41.080]  And then when they catch you on it or catch you selling it to support your habit,
[01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:44.080]  you're going to be thrown under the jail.
[01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:47.080]  And then the prisons are broken up into racial gangs.
[01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:51.080]  The black gangs, the white gangs, the Hispanic gangs, the Asian gangs.
[01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:53.080]  Just like they're breaking up the rest of our society.
[01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:58.080]  This is a social engineering program on record.
[01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:01.080]  And Rick Ross could have shoved about the CIA.
[01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:04.080]  He could have gone along. They wouldn't have given him a life sentence.
[01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:06.080]  I remember interviewing Gary Webb.
[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:11.080]  He's got the big renter film out right now.
[01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:14.080]  Of course, Kill the Messenger dealing with it.
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:16.080]  And I remember talking to Webb.
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:21.080]  He was going to come on in a few months and he gave me a disc with all his documents.
[01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:25.080]  And he was going to have a new book coming out to vindicate everything he'd done,
[01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:26.080]  everything he'd said.
[01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:29.080]  He'd won all sorts of prizes. You name it.
[01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:33.080]  But his editors and the LA Times run by the CIA.
[01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:35.080]  That was declassified two months ago.
[01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:38.080]  The CIA did target him with a disinformation campaign.
[01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:40.080]  They did lie and say he was discredited.
[01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:43.080]  He would never admit he was discredited because it wasn't true.
[01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:45.080]  And before he could vindicate himself, they killed him.
[01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:52.080]  Now, why would the CIA declassify that a month before the film came out two months ago?
[01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:57.080]  Why would they do something like that?
[01:11:57.080 --> 01:12:00.080]  Well, I'm going to ask Rick Ross that question.
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:04.080]  But I really think it's because it's already so well known.
[01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:08.080]  It's even on Fox News that our troops grow the opium and load it on C-130s.
[01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:13.080]  And then it comes here and then it goes through people like Ross that are intermediaries.
[01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:18.080]  It goes CIA to the black front because it's the black man bringing us the drugs.
[01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:24.080]  He's the bad guy, not the CIA, not the establishment.
[01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:26.080]  It's the Tony Montana type.
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:28.080]  It's the Cuban. He's behind it.
[01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:33.080]  It's the black guy or it's the white trash guy in the trailer selling the drugs.
[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:36.080]  No, it's not.
[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:39.080]  And then as the economy shuts down, more people want the drugs.
[01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:40.080]  Your daughter gets hooked on them.
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:42.080]  Now she's a topless dancer.
[01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:44.080]  Then she's a hooker.
[01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:46.080]  This is how you bring down society.
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:49.080]  And then you've got SWAT teams running around paramilitary for the war on drugs.
[01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:51.080]  You've got the Patriot Act you're using for the war on drugs.
[01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:56.080]  Merging it all together so everyone's under suspicion.
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:59.080]  Your daughter hurts her back in a volleyball accident.
[01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:03.080]  That's how one of my friends, when she's 16, two years later is addicted to pain pills.
[01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:05.080]  Goes around doctor shopping to get the things.
[01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:08.080]  Instead of getting treatment, they throw her in jail.
[01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:10.080]  Then she gets in with bad people.
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:14.080]  Next she comes out with an education and criminal activity after a year
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:17.080]  and becomes, you guessed it, a street walker.
[01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:21.080]  This is how you kill a civilization.
[01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:23.080]  This is how you annihilate a culture.
[01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:26.080]  This is how you bring a country down.
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:32.080]  A minority of people on the YouTube comments and on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com
[01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:38.080]  said, what do you do in having a huge cocaine dealer on your show?
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:43.080]  Okay, what are you doing putting up with a government that went into hiring?
[01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:45.080]  See, there's no outrage about that.
[01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:49.080]  There's no outrage about the big banks laundering $386 billion in two years.
[01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:51.080]  Bloomberg reported two banks alone.
[01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:55.080]  Wells Fargo, Wacovia, $380 plus billion.
[01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:56.080]  Type it in.
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:59.080]  Big banks laundered $300 plus billion.
[01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:02.080]  It'll pop up Bloomberg, AP, you name it, from four years ago.
[01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:03.080]  That's just one admission.
[01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:05.080]  They paid $111 million fine.
[01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:09.080]  That's like if you rob a bank for a million bucks, paying a $3,000 fine.
[01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:11.080]  It's a slap on the wrist.
[01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:12.080]  It's not a slap on the wrist.
[01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:15.080]  It's like them flicking a penny after they robbed the bank of the cops.
[01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:18.080]  You walk out, the cops open the truck up, help you load the stolen money,
[01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:20.080]  and you throw them a quarter.
[01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:21.080]  That's what this is.
[01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:23.080]  That's how this system works.
[01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:28.080]  Now it's expanding the racket with all the site testing in the schools
[01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:34.080]  and the drugging of the kids that way to get them into the system.
[01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:40.080]  I am the realrickross.com, freewayrick.com, freewayrickross.
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:43.080]  And I'm not going to go over his whole bio, but in 1996,
[01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:45.080]  he hadn't dealt drugs in years.
[01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:46.080]  They were getting rid of everybody.
[01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:48.080]  See, they always flush the people that worked for him.
[01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:50.080]  He was sentenced to life imprisonment after being convicted
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:54.080]  of trying to purchase more than 100 kilograms of cocaine from a federal agent.
[01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:57.080]  Ross became the subject of a controversy later that year
[01:14:57.080 --> 01:15:00.080]  when a series of articles by journalist Gary Webb and the San Jose Mercury
[01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:04.080]  brought to light the connection between one of Ross's cocaine sources
[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:07.080]  and the CIA as part of the Iran Contra scandal.
[01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:11.080]  His sentencing was later reduced to less than 20 years
[01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:13.080]  and released in September 2009.
[01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:17.080]  He's finally off the probation, the harassment, all of it,
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:19.080]  able to put his book out that's excellent.
[01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:22.080]  We're selling it at infowarsstore.com.
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:25.080]  Even if you already know all this, give this to friends and family.
[01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:28.080]  He is currently in the process of creating a feature-length film
[01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:33.080]  for his life story, Crackin' the System, and creating his autobiographical book,
[01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:36.080]  which is now out, and that is Freeway Rick Ross,
[01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:41.080]  The Untold Autobiography by Rick Ross with Kathy Scott,
[01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:44.080]  available right now at infowarsstore.com.
[01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:48.080]  We're by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:51.080]  I admire Rick Ross because I talked to Gary Webb about it.
[01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:53.080]  When this came out about the CIA and his trial,
[01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:55.080]  he didn't really know about it, he was blown away,
[01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:57.080]  everything suddenly made sense.
[01:15:57.080 --> 01:16:00.080]  They said, just shut up, don't cooperate with this reporter and people,
[01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:01.080]  and we'll go easy.
[01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:03.080]  He didn't, so they gave him life in prison.
[01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:07.080]  That was clearly done politically, so it was reduced.
[01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:09.080]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:11.080]  The issue is he's repented of it.
[01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:14.080]  The CIA and the New World Order haven't.
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:16.080]  So he joins us now until the end of the transmission,
[01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:18.080]  next hour in 45 minutes.
[01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:20.080]  We'll open the phones up for Rick Ross next hour.
[01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:24.080]  But Rick, it was like sunny and 80 degrees a few days ago.
[01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:27.080]  Sorry you got to be in Austin when this global warming cold front hits,
[01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:29.080]  but thank you so much for coming.
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:31.080]  No, I'm just blown away to be here.
[01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:35.080]  I remember when I was in prison and you tried to come down to see me
[01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:38.080]  and make sure that I was okay,
[01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:42.080]  and it was one of my dreams to sit here with you in the studio,
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:45.080]  and here I am today, and I'm just blown away, man.
[01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:48.080]  And thanks for still having me here.
[01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:50.080]  Oh, it's awesome to have you.
[01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:52.080]  And you're speaking to college students all over the country.
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:55.080]  You're speaking to the Black Congressional Congress Press Club.
[01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:57.080]  You're at the premiere with Renner of the film.
[01:16:57.080 --> 01:17:00.080]  I mean, you're having a big effect now,
[01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:02.080]  and that is so exciting that you can really educate people,
[01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:04.080]  because back when this all first came out,
[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:06.080]  people didn't believe the CIA was bringing drugs in.
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:08.080]  I didn't believe it.
[01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:10.080]  I mean, I'm going to be honest with you.
[01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:12.080]  Even when Gary reported the story and I was like,
[01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:15.080]  this guy, Gary, what is he talking about?
[01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:18.080]  I was involved with the CIA in no way.
[01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:25.080]  It wasn't until the CIA themselves told me that they were involved
[01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:27.080]  and put out their report.
[01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:31.080]  I mean, that was when it really hit me that, hey, Gary was right.
[01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:34.080]  Because, I mean, it was just hard for me to believe.
[01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:37.080]  How can a little guy like me who wasn't supposed to succeed,
[01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:40.080]  couldn't read, couldn't write, high school dropout,
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:45.080]  I mean, how could I be involved with something this big?
[01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:48.080]  I mean, it was just totally shocking to me.
[01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:50.080]  I'll be honest with you.
[01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:53.080]  Let's start at the beginning.
[01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:56.080]  And in the few minutes we have before break,
[01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:58.080]  start at the beginning of your life,
[01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:00.080]  get into how you got into drug dealing,
[01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:02.080]  how you suddenly found this incredible source
[01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:04.080]  that made you the biggest dealer on the West Coast,
[01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:06.080]  and then we'll lead right through your trial, prison,
[01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:08.080]  the drug warrant phone calls.
[01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:10.080]  All right, let's do that.
[01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:12.080]  Well, you know, I was born here in Texas, Tyler.
[01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:17.080]  My mom decided that she wanted to try Los Angeles,
[01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:20.080]  give us an opportunity to have more than what she had.
[01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:22.080]  She was a maid here in Tyler.
[01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:24.080]  So she moved to L.A.
[01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:27.080]  I moved in during the riots riot,
[01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:29.080]  right when the riots broke out.
[01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:32.080]  I got to see the Black Panthers and, you know,
[01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:34.080]  I used to want to be a Panther.
[01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:36.080]  So I go to school and, you know,
[01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:38.080]  I used to be like any other normal kid, you know,
[01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:40.080]  want to be a police officer, a firefighter,
[01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:42.080]  an airplane pilot,
[01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:44.080]  started playing tennis in high school, you know,
[01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:46.080]  did pretty good, made all city,
[01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:48.080]  was all for scholarships,
[01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:50.080]  but I couldn't read or write.
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:52.080]  So when it was time to take the scholarships,
[01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:54.080]  I couldn't go to college.
[01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:57.080]  So I found myself with the one thing
[01:18:57.080 --> 01:19:00.080]  that I thought that I could count on was my tennis
[01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:02.080]  to get me out the ghetto,
[01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:06.080]  and I found that that was no longer an option for me.
[01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:08.080]  So I found myself back in the streets
[01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:10.080]  in South Central Los Angeles.
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:12.080]  So I'm walking around trying to figure out,
[01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:14.080]  you know, what was I going to do with myself
[01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:16.080]  and couldn't get a job,
[01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:19.080]  you know, even though I was a very hard worker,
[01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:21.080]  had no problem, you know,
[01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:23.080]  rolling up my sleeves and doing whatever,
[01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:26.080]  car washing, taking out trash,
[01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:28.080]  any number of things.
[01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:31.080]  It's anything that I could do to start making a living.
[01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:33.080]  I was willing to do it.
[01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:36.080]  Well, one of my friends came from college
[01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:39.080]  and he had this stuff called cocaine.
[01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:41.080]  Stay right there.
[01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:43.080]  We're going to come back there and start
[01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:45.080]  with your friend from college coming back.
[01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:48.080]  Freeway Rick Ross is our guest, the untold autobiography.

[01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:52.080]  at 877-99-B-E-R-K-E-Y.
[01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:54.080]  Big Berkey water filters
[01:22:54.080 --> 01:23:22.080]  for the love of clean water.
[01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:26.080]  Big Berkey, the one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.

[01:23:56.080 --> 01:24:24.080]  Big Berkey water filters for the love of clean water.
[01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:28.080]  Big Berkey, the one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.
[01:24:56.080 --> 01:24:58.080]  Big Berkey, the one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.

[01:25:56.080 --> 01:25:58.080]  Before I started selling cocaine,
[01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:01.080]  they started coming out with movies like Super Fly
[01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:04.080]  and almost like priming you up for this lifestyle
[01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:06.080]  that you're about to get into.
[01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:09.080]  So when my friend comes and shows me cocaine,
[01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:11.080]  I'm interested because I saw Super Fly.
[01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:14.080]  What you hit is key. The CIA has now declassified that.
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:16.080]  Rock and roll, the drug culture.
[01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:19.080]  The CIA delivered the first suitcases of LSD.
[01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:21.080]  White kids weren't smoking marijuana.
[01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:22.080]  They delivered it.
[01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:24.080]  I mean, it's incredible. They primed the whole deal.
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:27.080]  Oh, absolutely. It's almost like to get your mind ready
[01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:30.080]  so that when you get the opportunity that you're interested in.
[01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:32.080]  It's called predictive programming.
[01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:35.080]  Go ahead. I'm sorry. It's just what you're saying is absolutely right.
[01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:37.080]  So when my friend comes and he shows me this stuff,
[01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:39.080]  I've never seen it before.
[01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:41.080]  It was yellowish. Yellowish white.
[01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:44.080]  And I'm like, well, I thought cocaine was supposed to be white.
[01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:46.080]  He's like, no, man, this is it.
[01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:49.080]  So he introduces it to me. He gives me a little bit, like $50 worth.
[01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:51.080]  He said, go and see what you can do with it.
[01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:53.080]  So I go around the neighborhood and I'm asking everybody.
[01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:55.080]  Nobody knows what it is.
[01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:57.080]  I mean, I'm going all over South Central LA.
[01:26:57.080 --> 01:26:59.080]  Finally, I run into a guy. He was a pimp.
[01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:01.080]  And he says, let me see it.
[01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:03.080]  And he takes it and he cooks it up.
[01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:06.080]  And he says, oh, yes, pretty good stuff.
[01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:08.080]  And that's how I got started selling cocaine.
[01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:12.080]  And it went from there to this one person would buy from me
[01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:14.080]  and then another would come and he would introduce me
[01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:16.080]  to somebody else until up, you know,
[01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:18.080]  some days I'm making $3 million a day.
[01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:21.080]  So you got it on the ground floor of it.
[01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:23.080]  Yeah, absolutely. Totally ground.
[01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:25.080]  Was totally a novice.
[01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:27.080]  I had never smoked pot at that time.
[01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:30.080]  I was still tinkering on being a tennis player, you know, like,
[01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:33.080]  I don't know if you're going to make it in tennis, you know,
[01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:35.080]  but you got to do something, you know,
[01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:37.080]  my mom's on my back right now because I'm living with my mom.
[01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:40.080]  I'm not bringing any income and she's really going hard on me.
[01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:42.080]  You know, you're a bum.
[01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:44.080]  You're not going to be doing nothing with your life.
[01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:47.080]  So I desperately want to do something now.
[01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:49.080]  I need to make some money somewhere.
[01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:51.080]  So when this opportunity came, you know,
[01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:53.080]  I thought that it was a blessing from God, you know,
[01:27:53.080 --> 01:27:56.080]  I start off just helping Mike, who was my friend, you know,
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:58.080]  I'd make the money for him, give him all the money.
[01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:02.080]  And pretty soon I know the business.
[01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:06.080]  It goes from there from making 50 bucks a week to, you know,
[01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:09.080]  like I said, $3 million a day sometimes.
[01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:12.080]  In fact, I was reading sometimes you were bringing in $30 million
[01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:15.080]  a deal every few days.
[01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:18.080]  Well, yeah, I mean, if you add up 10 days, you know,
[01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:20.080]  you do 10 days, what for, what for dealing?
[01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:23.080]  You know, you taught my $10 million or more.
[01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:24.080]  No, like 30 million dollars.
[01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:26.080]  And this is 1980s money.
[01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:28.080]  Yeah, 1880s money.
[01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:32.080]  84, 85, 86.
[01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:36.080]  So you were there when folks didn't even know what cocaine was.
[01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:39.080]  In my community, nobody, nobody knew what cocaine was.
[01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:41.080]  Yeah, it was a rich white guy drug.
[01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:42.080]  Well, that's how I felt.
[01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:44.080]  You know, I felt that when I first started selling cocaine,
[01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:47.080]  I felt that it was another.
[01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:49.080]  Because I've been discriminated against, you know,
[01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:51.080]  I've been to a hospital and they said, oh, no,
[01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:55.080]  you can't sit right there because this is a white only section.
[01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:56.080]  You have to go to the back.
[01:28:56.080 --> 01:28:59.080]  So when I started selling cocaine, that's how I felt about cocaine.
[01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:01.080]  It was another one of those things that they said, no,
[01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:03.080]  this is for white people and you guys can't have it.
[01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:07.080]  So I felt like I was bringing cocaine to my community to give us something.
[01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:09.080]  But the CIA said, oh, you blacks want it.
[01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:11.080]  We're going to make something special for you.
[01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:12.080]  Here's how you make crack.
[01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:15.080]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:29:15.080 --> 01:29:16.080]  Totally.
[01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:18.080]  Makes it head harder, be more addictive,
[01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:19.080]  turn people into zombies.
[01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:20.080]  Yeah.
[01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:22.080]  I mean, that's what happened.
[01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:24.080]  Exactly how it turned out.
[01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:25.080]  Unbelievable.
[01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:27.080]  We're going to break it all down.
[01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:28.080]  18-minute segment coming up.
[01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:30.080]  You're going to get the floor, get ready to roll,
[01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:31.080]  just go through it all.
[01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:33.080]  Rick Ross is our guest.
[01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:37.080]  Ground level of the CIA crack cocaine epidemic.
[01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:39.080]  And then all of a sudden, years after he's out of it,
[01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:41.080]  they want to get rid of all the loose ends.
[01:29:41.080 --> 01:29:42.080]  They're trying to throw him in jail.
[01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:44.080]  Turns out all the people involved,
[01:29:44.080 --> 01:29:45.080]  they all knew what was going on.
[01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:48.080]  The CIA came to visiting to shut your mouth.
[01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:49.080]  We're on the march.
[01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:52.080]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.080 --> 01:29:55.080]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.080 --> 01:30:01.080]  On the eve of Thanksgiving this year,
[01:30:01.080 --> 01:30:03.080]  I was thinking, what am I really thankful for?
[01:30:03.080 --> 01:30:05.080]  And I got to tell you, it's my family.
[01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:07.080]  It's all the blessings of liberty that our forebears secured.
[01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:09.080]  And it's you, the listeners of the broadcast,
[01:30:09.080 --> 01:30:11.080]  who've made everything we do possible.
[01:30:11.080 --> 01:30:14.080]  This Black Friday, I decided to bring you
[01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:16.080]  the biggest special we've ever offered
[01:30:16.080 --> 01:30:19.080]  on any of the nutraceuticals at infowarslife.com.
[01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:21.080]  I'm talking about silver bullet colloidal silver
[01:30:21.080 --> 01:30:23.080]  that we've been sold out of for months.
[01:30:23.080 --> 01:30:25.080]  This time I doubled down and got even more.
[01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:28.080]  As of me taping this, on the eve of Thanksgiving,
[01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:29.080]  we have already sold half of it.
[01:30:29.080 --> 01:30:32.080]  So instead of keeping the price at its regular discounted price,
[01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:35.080]  we are going to give you 20% off and free shipping
[01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:36.080]  on single bottles.
[01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:38.080]  But if you get four bottles,
[01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:39.080]  we're going to give you the fifth one free
[01:30:39.080 --> 01:30:40.080]  and the free shipping.
[01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:41.080]  I don't know how long this special will run,
[01:30:41.080 --> 01:30:43.080]  but if supplies last, we will extend it out
[01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:45.080]  until Cyber Monday.
[01:30:45.080 --> 01:30:47.080]  You'll find powerful nutraceuticals like silver bullet
[01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:49.080]  and others at infowarslife.com
[01:30:49.080 --> 01:30:52.080]  by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:54.080]  Again, this is Alex Jones wishing you all
[01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:56.080]  a blessed and happy Thanksgiving
[01:30:56.080 --> 01:30:58.080]  and thanking you all for your support of freedom.
[01:30:58.080 --> 01:31:00.080]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:03.080]  When cells become toxic, they die early,
[01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:05.080]  and aging sets in.
[01:31:05.080 --> 01:31:07.080]  In the past decade, we have witnessed
[01:31:07.080 --> 01:31:09.080]  unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:12.080]  During that period, key patented compounds
[01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:14.080]  have focused on mitochondrial growth,
[01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:16.080]  nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:19.080]  But no one has put together a formula
[01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:21.080]  that focuses directly on brain health,
[01:31:21.080 --> 01:31:23.080]  nerve growth factors,
[01:31:23.080 --> 01:31:26.080]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:28.080]  We now have the synergistic solution,
[01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:31.080]  DNA force, just one of the key compounds.
[01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:35.080]  BiopQQ is backed by major clinical studies,
[01:31:35.080 --> 01:31:39.080]  and over 175 PubMed listed published studies.
[01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:40.080]  You want the best that's out there
[01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:42.080]  at the lowest price anywhere?
[01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:44.080]  The ultimate value, cutting edge,
[01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:45.080]  trailblazing game changer
[01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:47.080]  that also supports the InfoWars.
[01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:49.080]  Secure your DNA force today
[01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:51.080]  at InfoWarsLife.com

[01:31:55.080 --> 01:31:58.080]  DNA force from InfoWarsLife.
[01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:01.080]  When you're out on the road,
[01:32:01.080 --> 01:32:05.080]  the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:07.080]  But if the unfortunate happens,
[01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:09.080]  you'll be glad you were wearing
[01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:11.080]  diamond gussets.
[01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:14.080]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:19.080]  where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:23.080]  They so pride in every stitch,
[01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:27.080]  guarantee you love the way they fit.
[01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:30.080]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch
[01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:32.080]  where you need it most.
[01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:36.080]  Blue diamond gussets got it,
[01:32:36.080 --> 01:33:01.080]  others don't.
[01:33:01.080 --> 01:33:03.080]  I'm beginning a new effort
[01:33:03.080 --> 01:33:05.080]  to fix as much of our immigration system
[01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:07.080]  as I can on my own.
[01:33:07.080 --> 01:33:09.080]  I've also directed Secretary Johnson
[01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:11.080]  and Attorney General Holder
[01:33:11.080 --> 01:33:13.080]  to identify additional actions
[01:33:13.080 --> 01:33:15.080]  my administration can take on our own
[01:33:15.080 --> 01:33:18.080]  within my existing legal authorities
[01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:20.080]  to do what Congress refuses to do
[01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:23.080]  and fix as much of our immigration system as we can.
[01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:27.080]  From the front lines of the Information War,
[01:33:27.080 --> 01:33:29.080]  it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:36.080]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:38.080]  We've got Rick Ross with us
[01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:40.080]  for the entire third hour coming up.
[01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:42.080]  About 20 minutes into that hour,
[01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:43.080]  I'm going to open the phones up
[01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:46.080]  for your questions for Freeway Rick Ross.
[01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:48.080]  And he is here with us.
[01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:52.080]  We are selling his amazing untold story autobiography.
[01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:56.080]  It is available at infowarstore.com
[01:33:56.080 --> 01:34:01.080]  or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:04.080]  And you need to give this to young people, you know.
[01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:07.080]  You need to give this to police officers, you know.
[01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:09.080]  You need to give this to preachers, you know.
[01:34:09.080 --> 01:34:12.080]  It is so immoral and hypocritical.
[01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:13.080]  If the preacher gets up in the pulpit
[01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:15.080]  and gives an anti-drug sermon,
[01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:17.080]  which I think they should.
[01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:20.080]  I mean, drugs, whether they're prescription or illicit,
[01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:22.080]  are just super destructive.
[01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:23.080]  Everybody knows that.
[01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:24.080]  I mean, sure, some opiate pills
[01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:26.080]  are fine if your leg's broken, you had surgery,
[01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:28.080]  but it just wrecks people's lives.
[01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:31.080]  They are making this stuff illegal
[01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:34.080]  so they can make money in the black market,
[01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:36.080]  no pun intended,
[01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:39.080]  and then still puts you in prison.
[01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:42.080]  This is a social engineering plan.
[01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:44.080]  Also, it's part of the social engineering
[01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:47.080]  with the GMO and the additives in the food and water.
[01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:49.080]  They don't want you getting all natural, healthy things.
[01:34:49.080 --> 01:34:50.080]  They don't want you knowing
[01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:53.080]  that they've taken the good halogen iodine
[01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:55.080]  out of the salt and food and bread
[01:34:55.080 --> 01:35:00.080]  and put the bad halogens of bromide, bromide, and fluoride in.
[01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:01.080]  They just fry your glands.
[01:35:01.080 --> 01:35:04.080]  They don't want you to know about survival shield X2.
[01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:06.080]  NASA and I and I, we're the only company
[01:35:06.080 --> 01:35:08.080]  that has the deep earth crystal source.
[01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:10.080]  All the rest is a seaweed source, which is still great.
[01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:12.080]  Sea salts are great if it's all you can get
[01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:14.080]  or the seaweed-based stuff.
[01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:16.080]  That's what I first got on and changed my life,
[01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:18.080]  helped me lose a bunch of weight and get healthier.
[01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:21.080]  But man, when I got on the crystal source, X2,
[01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:24.080]  a group had been trying to get a source of this for years.
[01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:26.080]  Dr. Grubb, and then finally, a couple years ago,
[01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:28.080]  had it and took him years to get it together.
[01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:30.080]  And I mean, you got to jump through DEA hoops.
[01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:34.080]  You name it to get iodine because it's a very powerful substance.
[01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:36.080]  The type we use is the crystal source.
[01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:38.080]  It turns into purple gas.
[01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:41.080]  We put it on a hot plate. We have video of it.
[01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:46.080]  I mean, it's that pure, 200 million-year-old,
[01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:48.080]  unbelievable what it does in your body.
[01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:50.080]  Just get ready for all the oil to come out all the time.
[01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:52.080]  What has done for me and my family has been sensational.
[01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:59.080]  Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:35:59.080 --> 01:36:01.080]  I got some good news and some bad news.
[01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:03.080]  It is going to sell out by the end of the week.
[01:36:03.080 --> 01:36:06.080]  The good news is it may only take three weeks to get more in.
[01:36:06.080 --> 01:36:10.080]  So if you want survival shield X2 discounted 10%,
[01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:12.080]  we're just keeping that discount until it sells out
[01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:14.080]  when you get it with the lung cleanse.
[01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:16.080]  It's part of the Biodefense pack.
[01:36:16.080 --> 01:36:17.080]  10% off.
[01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:20.080]  You can also use the promo code N-O-W
[01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:24.080]  and get 5% off all the other products that are already discounted.
[01:36:24.080 --> 01:36:27.080]  DNA force, oxypowder, already the lowest price on oxypowder,
[01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:29.080]  but 5% off promo code now.
[01:36:29.080 --> 01:36:31.080]  Super male vitality, super female vitality.
[01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:34.080]  And again, this doesn't mimic testosterone,
[01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:36.080]  the concentrated organic herbs that are in there.
[01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:38.080]  It's stuff that's been developed to get your body
[01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:40.080]  to release what you're already supposed to have
[01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:43.080]  with all the chemicals and the estrogen mimickers
[01:36:43.080 --> 01:36:45.080]  that are really screwing men up particularly.
[01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:48.080]  Then the formulations for women to help get them cleaned up.
[01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:50.080]  And you've heard the rave reviews.
[01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:51.080]  We are self-funding here.
[01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:55.080]  I fund this whole operation off books, videos, t-shirts, sponsors.
[01:36:55.080 --> 01:36:57.080]  We're not like NPR getting public money.
[01:36:57.080 --> 01:37:00.080]  We're not like MSNBC getting stimulus money.
[01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:02.080]  Our parent company isn't some weapons manufacturer.
[01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:06.080]  This is an operation set up by me, Alex Jones,
[01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:08.080]  to try to promote the truth.
[01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:10.080]  Because the truth will set us free, as Christ said.
[01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:12.080]  So Freeway Rick Ross is our guest.
[01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:13.080]  FreewayRick.com.
[01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:15.080]  You can get his book there as well.
[01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:18.080]  Or at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:23.080]  Find the supplements at InfowarsLife.com.
[01:37:23.080 --> 01:37:25.080]  Or again, the book at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:37:25.080 --> 01:37:28.080]  And please remember to support our local AM and FM affiliates,
[01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:30.080]  whether it's Oklahoma City or...
[01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:32.080]  I haven't plugged some of these new affiliates.
[01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:35.080]  We've got one, a new one in Chicago, on top of our other affiliate.
[01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:38.080]  And we've also got...
[01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:40.080]  Jasper, Texas just turned us on.
[01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:42.080]  It's like five or six new affiliates the last two weeks
[01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:43.080]  and I haven't plugged them.
[01:37:43.080 --> 01:37:44.080]  They've told me to plug them.
[01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:47.080]  If you print those out again, I'll actually mention those on air.
[01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:50.080]  But please tell friends and family about the show if you're listening to it.
[01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:53.080]  It's a big deal that a show telling the truth like this can be heard.
[01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:55.080]  It's all word of mouth.
[01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:57.080]  Please support their local sponsors.
[01:37:57.080 --> 01:37:59.080]  Please tell them why you're supporting the sponsors.
[01:37:59.080 --> 01:38:01.080]  Or become a sponsor.
[01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:03.080]  If you're a car dealership, or a restaurant,
[01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:08.080]  or a bookstore, or a maid service, or a hotel, whatever.
[01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:10.080]  You better support it.
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:13.080]  That's why we've gone from being on the weekends to weeknights
[01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:17.080]  to prime time on almost every affiliate that picks up our show.
[01:38:17.080 --> 01:38:19.080]  It's because you have been supporting it.
[01:38:19.080 --> 01:38:21.080]  So you're the reason we're reaching more people.
[01:38:21.080 --> 01:38:24.080]  Now, Rick Ross, you've got the floor.
[01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:26.080]  You've told the story.
[01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:28.080]  Biggest cocaine dealer in West Coast history.
[01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:30.080]  When it came out in your trial,
[01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:34.080]  that the prosecution knew, the government knew, the DEA knew, the CIA knew,
[01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:36.080]  that you were one of their main distributors,
[01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:38.080]  but you didn't even know.
[01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:40.080]  I want to get into that relationship and more.
[01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:43.080]  But you've gotten to the point in a few years to where,
[01:38:43.080 --> 01:38:44.080]  tell the story.
[01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:45.080]  Did you ever use?
[01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:47.080]  Why were you so successful?
[01:38:47.080 --> 01:38:49.080]  And then go ahead and walk through everything that happened.
[01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:53.080]  And then now what your message is to the youth about what's really going on.
[01:38:53.080 --> 01:38:54.080]  And we'll talk about Gary Webb.
[01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:57.080]  Well, I did start using for a short time.
[01:38:57.080 --> 01:39:02.080]  I got up to a point to where I probably had about $8,000 or $9,000.
[01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:04.080]  I thought I was rich.
[01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:07.080]  So when you're rich, you start experimenting with the drugs.
[01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:10.080]  And I looked up, all my money was gone.
[01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:12.080]  So I immediately quit using.
[01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:14.080]  I went back and regrouped.
[01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:15.080]  I learned that from tennis.
[01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:19.080]  When you're doing something wrong, you go back and you figure out what you're doing wrong.
[01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:21.080]  So I figured out that I couldn't use anymore.
[01:39:21.080 --> 01:39:23.080]  If I want to be rich, I had to stop using.
[01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:26.080]  So I stopped using and I went on to get rich.
[01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:29.080]  Well, I made a lot of money.
[01:39:29.080 --> 01:39:31.080]  Like I said, I made $3 million a day sometimes.
[01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:34.080]  And then it got to the point to where I started seeing the effects
[01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:37.080]  that cocaine was having inside of my community.
[01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:42.080]  And it wasn't the effects that I initially thought that it was going to have.
[01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:44.080]  You know, I started seeing people pushing baskets.
[01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:48.080]  I started seeing women walking the streets and women doing anything to get high.
[01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:51.080]  And I started to rethink my position.
[01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:56.080]  That was around 88, 89.
[01:39:56.080 --> 01:39:58.080]  At that time, I threw my hands up.
[01:39:58.080 --> 01:39:59.080]  I said, you know what?
[01:39:59.080 --> 01:40:00.080]  I'm through with the cocaine business.
[01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:01.080]  I got enough money.
[01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:02.080]  I got more money now.
[01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:04.080]  And I ever thought that I would have in my life.
[01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:05.080]  I got businesses.
[01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:07.080]  So I walked away.
[01:40:07.080 --> 01:40:12.080]  Well, what happened is the government came back and indicted me for the things that I'd already done,
[01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:16.080]  went to prison, did five years in prison.
[01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:22.080]  I got out as immediately after I got out, they had Danilo Blandon started to call me.
[01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:26.080]  And his goal was to get me back inside of drugs, but I didn't want to go back.
[01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:28.080]  I was trying to go straight.
[01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:33.080]  He hounded me for like six months to introduce him to one of my friends.
[01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:40.080]  Once I made the introduction, my friend handed him a bag of money and cops swooped in,
[01:40:40.080 --> 01:40:44.080]  arrested all of us and they got me for brokering the deal for making the introduction saying that
[01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:47.080]  I knew that they were going to be doing a drug deal.
[01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:51.080]  And for that reason that I ate it in a bed at the crime.
[01:40:51.080 --> 01:40:54.080]  For that, doing that crime, it gave me a life sentence.
[01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:58.080]  While I was sitting in jail doing this life sentence, fighting my case,
[01:40:58.080 --> 01:41:02.080]  I was approached by a reporter, Gary Webb.
[01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:04.080]  Well, Gary came down and he saw me.
[01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:08.080]  He started talking about that I was in something bigger than what I thought I was.
[01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:11.080]  But you know also two addicts, there was some cops on my case.
[01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:14.080]  They called itself the Freeway Task Force.
[01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:20.080]  And those cops were robbing and stealing and they let the dog bite me while I was handcuffed.
[01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:22.080]  They got indicted as well.
[01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:27.080]  So I meet Gary Webb and he's like, oh man, this is bigger than what you think it is.
[01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:29.080]  I'm thinking that they're talking about the crooked cops.
[01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:33.080]  You know, it's like 35, 40 cops that's running around robbing drug dealers taking their money
[01:41:33.080 --> 01:41:36.080]  and they became drug dealers themselves.
[01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:39.080]  Really, because they was taking the drugs from one person,
[01:41:39.080 --> 01:41:45.080]  planting them on another person and selling them to this person and just criminal enterprise.
[01:41:45.080 --> 01:41:50.080]  I mean, the whole war on drugs is just like one big hopes of one person
[01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:53.080]  benefiting this one, another one benefiting that way.
[01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:58.080]  But at the end of the day, guys like myself get caught in the middle
[01:41:58.080 --> 01:42:02.080]  and I believe that we're the ones who's paying the biggest price.
[01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:08.080]  Not necessarily myself because when I was in prison, I couldn't cry about my time.
[01:42:08.080 --> 01:42:10.080]  You know, if they'd have gave me the life sentence,
[01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:13.080]  I'd have had to do the rest of my life in prison.
[01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:18.080]  I could have accepted that because I knew that what I was doing.
[01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:23.080]  You know, I knew I was selling drugs and I knew that I shouldn't have been selling drugs after a period of time.
[01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:30.080]  You know, that's the key to integrity and sanity I've learned is admitting when you've been wrong, admitting and owning up to it.
[01:42:30.080 --> 01:42:32.080]  But then there's the giant hypocrisy.
[01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:35.080]  They're the ones bringing the drugs in and they're the ones putting you in jail.
[01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:39.080]  That's a thousand times worse and they never own up to any of it.
[01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:42.080]  In fact, they set up there like they're God and they're clean and they're good.
[01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:44.080]  That makes you want to throw up.
[01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:48.080]  Well, you know, that's what really, really started to affect me.
[01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:53.080]  You know, when I was in prison and I'm like, once everything came out and I interviewed with the CIA,
[01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:55.080]  you know, the CIA came down to my jail cell.
[01:42:55.080 --> 01:42:57.080]  Let's talk about that.
[01:42:57.080 --> 01:43:00.080]  But let's also go back to your trial when you learn about all this with Gary Webb.
[01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:05.080]  Tell that story because Webb talked about how you got threatened out in the hall, threatened to kill human stuff.
[01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:07.080]  They didn't just threaten to kill us kids.
[01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:12.080]  I mean, the feds themselves that were there, not just the CIA, they were basically all in on it.
[01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:15.080]  But the CIA, I mean, they sandbacked us doing trial.
[01:43:15.080 --> 01:43:17.080]  We're going to trial.
[01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:24.080]  So we have a, there's a period in court where you get to interview the informant because we never talk to the informant.
[01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:26.080]  We don't know what the informant is going to say.
[01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:30.080]  You have no clue about what the person who's going to testify against you going to say.
[01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:38.080]  So the court has a thing where they call a pre-trial hearing where the informant is supposed to be come to like a little room.
[01:43:38.080 --> 01:43:42.080]  I couldn't be there, but my lawyer was supposed to be there and Gary was supposed to be there.
[01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:48.080]  Well, anyway, bland on comes in this hearing and when they get in the room and my lawyer wants to ask him some questions.
[01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:51.080]  And the guy said, everything that I got to say, I'm going to say doing trial.
[01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:54.080]  So we don't know what this guy is going to say.
[01:43:54.080 --> 01:43:55.080]  So we start.
[01:43:55.080 --> 01:43:57.080]  You're unable to ever do a deposition.
[01:43:57.080 --> 01:43:59.080]  No deposition with this guy.
[01:43:59.080 --> 01:44:03.080]  So when we get to trial, my lawyer, you don't have a clue what's going on.
[01:44:03.080 --> 01:44:06.080]  All the information that Gary has, we don't have this information.
[01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:08.080]  And Gary's not giving it to us.
[01:44:08.080 --> 01:44:14.080]  He didn't give us this information at first because Gary knew I had the relationship with LA Times.
[01:44:14.080 --> 01:44:24.080]  So I felt that Gary was worried about me leaking his information to Jesse Katz at LA Times because, you know, me and Jesse Katz still had a relationship where we talked once in a while.
[01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:26.080]  So Gary didn't give it to us.
[01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:32.080]  We start trial and in the middle of trial, my lawyer keeps running back and forth to Gary.
[01:44:32.080 --> 01:44:34.080]  Gary's in the audience.
[01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:45.080]  So he's at the trial table with me and he gets up from the trial table when he goes and he talks to Blandon and he goes back and he asks Gary because Gary's feeding him like little bits of pieces.
[01:44:45.080 --> 01:44:46.080]  That was smart.
[01:44:46.080 --> 01:44:51.080]  That way the LA Times now admitted run by the CIA, the editor CIA trying to cover all this up.
[01:44:51.080 --> 01:44:57.080]  You didn't know that he could only ask it while it was happening live so he would get the intel and they couldn't spin it.
[01:44:57.080 --> 01:44:58.080]  Exactly.
[01:44:58.080 --> 01:45:03.080]  I mean, he had to do it like that almost because I may have given it to Jesse.
[01:45:03.080 --> 01:45:06.080]  Not knowing, you know, because I didn't know the scope of this.
[01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:08.080]  Believe me, I had no idea.
[01:45:08.080 --> 01:45:12.080]  You know, they tried to say that I told Gary how to put it together.
[01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:13.080]  You know, they said that, right?
[01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:14.080]  Yes.
[01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:15.080]  They did.
[01:45:15.080 --> 01:45:19.080]  Oh, Rick Ross dreamed this all up and put this together and fed it to Gary and got Gary to buy into it.
[01:45:19.080 --> 01:45:20.080]  But I didn't know none of this.
[01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:23.080]  They gave me more credit than I deserve.
[01:45:23.080 --> 01:45:25.080]  Who would have thought the LA Times, you know, was involved?
[01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:26.080]  Yeah.
[01:45:26.080 --> 01:45:28.080]  That's how it works.
[01:45:28.080 --> 01:45:32.080]  So you're going to take down a culture and bring in and make trillions off drugs.
[01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:33.080]  Around the newspapers.
[01:45:33.080 --> 01:45:34.080]  Yeah, you have to.
[01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:35.080]  You have to.
[01:45:35.080 --> 01:45:36.080]  And that's what's so amazing.
[01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:40.080]  Even right now, today, you know, it baffles me that people don't know this.
[01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:42.080]  I'm like, the CIA admitted it.
[01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:43.080]  They got a report.
[01:45:43.080 --> 01:45:46.080]  You can go to their website and the report is on their website and people don't know it.
[01:45:46.080 --> 01:45:49.080]  By their inspector general, please continue.
[01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:55.080]  So we in court and Gary's action, my lawyer, this and then the judge recognized what's going on.
[01:45:55.080 --> 01:45:57.080]  And she was like, well, why do you keep talking to this reporter?
[01:45:57.080 --> 01:46:00.080]  Why are you running back and forth to him in the courtroom?
[01:46:00.080 --> 01:46:02.080]  I want you to stand here and do this.
[01:46:02.080 --> 01:46:07.080]  We're not on a fishing exposition because, you know, Gary was asking about certain names
[01:46:07.080 --> 01:46:12.080]  and Rick, Eric, and then Blanton talks about, well, my boss goes on a fishing trip with George Bush.
[01:46:12.080 --> 01:46:18.080]  And when they come back, they say the ends justify the means and all this type of stuff.
[01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:21.080]  But this stuff is still not making fall Machiavellia.
[01:46:21.080 --> 01:46:23.080]  To me, it doesn't make any sense.
[01:46:23.080 --> 01:46:24.080]  You know, I don't know.
[01:46:24.080 --> 01:46:28.080]  I mean, I'm learning about the court system while I'm near, but, you know, I'm not a lawyer.
[01:46:28.080 --> 01:46:31.080]  I'm still a novice.
[01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:36.080]  You know, this is a guy that couldn't read, you know, two years ago I couldn't read.
[01:46:36.080 --> 01:46:39.080]  So I'm still learning what's going on.
[01:46:39.080 --> 01:46:41.080]  So then eventually we finish trial.
[01:46:41.080 --> 01:46:43.080]  They give me the life sentence.
[01:46:43.080 --> 01:46:47.080]  And a couple months later, Gary's story come out.
[01:46:47.080 --> 01:46:48.080]  Gary sends me a copy.
[01:46:48.080 --> 01:46:50.080]  I get a copy the day before it comes out.
[01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:53.080]  I call Gary on the phone and then we start to talk.
[01:46:53.080 --> 01:46:56.080]  And he starts to tell me, you know, about the CIA being involved about the Contras.
[01:46:56.080 --> 01:46:59.080]  Because, you know, I really didn't know what the Contras was.
[01:46:59.080 --> 01:47:01.080]  I had no clue what the Contras was.
[01:47:01.080 --> 01:47:07.080]  Definitely did not know that they were backed by the CIA and Ronald Reagan and George Bush.
[01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:09.080]  Had no clue that they was backed by that.
[01:47:09.080 --> 01:47:14.080]  I did know that Danilo and these guys and all of his friends were fighting a war in their country.
[01:47:14.080 --> 01:47:17.080]  Didn't know what the war was over.
[01:47:17.080 --> 01:47:20.080]  I mean, you're talking about a guy that's illiterate still.
[01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:21.080]  I'm still illiterate.
[01:47:21.080 --> 01:47:22.080]  Had never read a book.
[01:47:22.080 --> 01:47:26.080]  Well, this stuff's complex and you're busy anyways. It's come out Ronald Reagan, not defending him.
[01:47:26.080 --> 01:47:30.080]  He didn't know it was George Herbert Walker Bush running all that as well, keeping it from him.
[01:47:30.080 --> 01:47:33.080]  So if the president didn't know, Rick, you can't blame me for not knowing.
[01:47:33.080 --> 01:47:37.080]  Yeah, so I'm still a novice to all the stuff that's going on.
[01:47:37.080 --> 01:47:42.080]  But when it comes out, Gary runs it down to him and he starts to tell me and I'm like, oh, this got Gary.
[01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:44.080]  He's out there.
[01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:51.080]  So the next thing I know a couple of days later, the OIG is at my cell.
[01:47:51.080 --> 01:47:54.080]  The CIA is at my cell.
[01:47:54.080 --> 01:47:57.080]  Congresswoman Maxine Waters is there.
[01:47:57.080 --> 01:47:59.080]  I mean, it just starts to pour.
[01:47:59.080 --> 01:48:00.080]  All these people are coming and coming.
[01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:02.080]  I'm like, what is going on?
[01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:03.080]  Let's talk about that.
[01:48:03.080 --> 01:48:05.080]  What did the CIA say to you when they came to your cell?
[01:48:05.080 --> 01:48:08.080]  Well, they started to talk to me about how much drugs I sold.
[01:48:08.080 --> 01:48:10.080]  Who did I get my drugs from?
[01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:13.080]  Did I have a contract with the CIA?
[01:48:13.080 --> 01:48:15.080]  And I was like, no, I ain't never been with the CIA.
[01:48:15.080 --> 01:48:17.080]  I don't know nothing about the CIA.
[01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:22.080]  They were compartmentalized. They wanted to act like he refutes the story.
[01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:24.080]  Kind of, yeah, that's what they pretty much said.
[01:48:24.080 --> 01:48:28.080]  And did I get drugs from Danilo Blandon?
[01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:30.080]  How long had I been getting drugs from him?
[01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:31.080]  That kind of stuff.
[01:48:31.080 --> 01:48:33.080]  And I was like, well, you guys want me to talk to you?
[01:48:33.080 --> 01:48:35.080]  Why you don't straighten my court sentence?
[01:48:35.080 --> 01:48:37.080]  You know, I got a life sentence.
[01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:38.080]  Will you straighten my court sentence out?
[01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:40.080]  No, we don't have anything to do with that.
[01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:42.080]  We're not going to help you with your courts.
[01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:44.080]  If you want to talk to us, you just talk to us.
[01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:46.080]  And this is how we're going to do it.
[01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:48.080]  That was pretty much that.
[01:48:48.080 --> 01:48:51.080]  By the way, they could have snapped their fingers and got you out a few years.
[01:48:51.080 --> 01:48:53.080]  Yeah, yeah, I already know.
[01:48:53.080 --> 01:48:56.080]  But, you know, I wasn't cooperating with what they wanted me to do.
[01:48:56.080 --> 01:49:00.080]  So that's why you're a hero overall, because more and more you had a chance
[01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:03.080]  once it came out that it had been going on to throw Gary Webb under the bus.
[01:49:03.080 --> 01:49:04.080]  You wouldn't do it.
[01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:09.080]  Oh, no, no, I respect what Gary does, what he did.
[01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:11.080]  Well, you're right. He's still alive.
[01:49:11.080 --> 01:49:13.080]  He's living on through a story.
[01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:17.080]  Absolutely, you know, and people, you know, they always pick in here and there
[01:49:17.080 --> 01:49:22.080]  about every little thing, you know, like, even with the movie, you know,
[01:49:22.080 --> 01:49:24.080]  what you didn't like about the movie.
[01:49:24.080 --> 01:49:25.080]  How did you like this?
[01:49:25.080 --> 01:49:30.080]  And, you know, it's like, hey, it's the spirit that people have to respect.
[01:49:30.080 --> 01:49:32.080]  I mean, this guy stood up for justice.
[01:49:32.080 --> 01:49:36.080]  He felt that even though I was selling drugs that I still had rights
[01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:41.080]  that had to be respected and that we should be treated.
[01:49:41.080 --> 01:49:45.080]  You shouldn't be in jail when the CIA sold you the drugs.
[01:49:45.080 --> 01:49:50.080]  I've had the pilot on that was flying him in to the military base.
[01:49:50.080 --> 01:49:53.080]  Yeah, that they were then delivering to you every week.
[01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:56.080]  Yeah, and what I don't, I didn't feel that way about myself,
[01:49:56.080 --> 01:49:58.080]  but I feel that way about guys right now in prison,
[01:49:58.080 --> 01:50:00.080]  because right now we have guys in prison,
[01:50:00.080 --> 01:50:05.080]  it's been in prison 25 and 30 years, never shot anybody, never carried a gun.
[01:50:05.080 --> 01:50:08.080]  All he did was sold a lot of drugs and got a lot of time,
[01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:10.080]  and he's still there right now today.
[01:50:10.080 --> 01:50:13.080]  Yeah, for those that don't know, the guns are down at the street level
[01:50:13.080 --> 01:50:17.080]  where dealers might get robbed or something up at the top other than bodyguards.
[01:50:17.080 --> 01:50:18.080]  I mean, were there ever guns?
[01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:21.080]  No, no, you didn't really need guns.
[01:50:21.080 --> 01:50:24.080]  The only time I would carry a gun if I went to a club or something like that
[01:50:24.080 --> 01:50:28.080]  and I think somebody might be going to kidnap me or try to do something to me,
[01:50:28.080 --> 01:50:30.080]  was the only self-defense.
[01:50:30.080 --> 01:50:34.080]  Never, I mean, you got more money than you can ever spend.
[01:50:34.080 --> 01:50:35.080]  What are you going to do with a gun?
[01:50:35.080 --> 01:50:37.080]  You know, guys who carry guns robbing people.
[01:50:37.080 --> 01:50:39.080]  That's because they're broke.
[01:50:39.080 --> 01:50:40.080]  You got plenty of money.
[01:50:40.080 --> 01:50:42.080]  The only way you want a gun is to protect your money.
[01:50:42.080 --> 01:50:43.080]  That's right.
[01:50:43.080 --> 01:50:48.080]  That's what good guns are for, is protecting your family and your money.
[01:50:48.080 --> 01:50:52.080]  I got my mind on my family and I got my hand on my gun.
[01:50:52.080 --> 01:50:55.080]  We'll be right back with Freeway Ricky Ross.
[01:50:55.080 --> 01:50:56.080]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:50:56.080 --> 01:51:13.080]  You're getting the inside scoop live.
[01:51:27.080 --> 01:51:28.080]  Hey, Boomer.
[01:51:28.080 --> 01:51:32.080]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[01:51:32.080 --> 01:51:33.080]  Good thing we have the Berkey system.
[01:51:33.080 --> 01:51:35.080]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[01:51:35.080 --> 01:51:39.080]  Mom says it's because the Berkey filtration system cleans out the bad stuff
[01:51:39.080 --> 01:51:41.080]  and leaks only pure, delicious water.
[01:51:41.080 --> 01:51:42.080]  I know, right?
[01:51:42.080 --> 01:51:43.080]  You love it too.
[01:51:43.080 --> 01:51:44.080]  Yeah, I'm thirsty too.
[01:51:44.080 --> 01:51:45.080]  Let's go get some.
[01:51:45.080 --> 01:51:50.080]  Get Berkey clean water by calling 877-886-3653.
[01:51:50.080 --> 01:51:54.080]  That's 877-886-3653.
[01:51:54.080 --> 01:51:59.080]  That's 8886-3653 or visit goberkey.com.
[01:51:59.080 --> 01:52:01.080]  On the eve of Thanksgiving this year, I was thinking,
[01:52:01.080 --> 01:52:03.080]  what am I really thankful for?
[01:52:03.080 --> 01:52:04.080]  And I got to tell you, it's my family.
[01:52:04.080 --> 01:52:07.080]  It's all the blessings of liberty that our forebearers secured.
[01:52:07.080 --> 01:52:11.080]  And it's you, the listeners of the broadcast, who've made everything we do possible.
[01:52:11.080 --> 01:52:16.080]  This Black Friday, I decided to bring you the biggest special we've ever offered
[01:52:16.080 --> 01:52:19.080]  on any of the nutraceuticals at infowarslife.com.
[01:52:19.080 --> 01:52:23.080]  I'm talking about silver bullet, loyal silver that we've been sold out of for months.
[01:52:23.080 --> 01:52:25.080]  This time I doubled down and got even more.
[01:52:25.080 --> 01:52:29.080]  As of me taping this on the eve of Thanksgiving, we have already sold half of them.
[01:52:29.080 --> 01:52:31.080]  So instead of keeping the price at its regular discounted price,
[01:52:31.080 --> 01:52:36.080]  we are going to give you 20% off and free shipping on single bottles.
[01:52:36.080 --> 01:52:39.080]  But if you get four bottles, we're going to give you the fifth one free and the free shipping.
[01:52:39.080 --> 01:52:41.080]  I don't know how long this special will run,
[01:52:41.080 --> 01:52:44.080]  but if supplies last, we will extend it out until Cyber Monday.
[01:52:44.080 --> 01:52:49.080]  You'll find powerful nutraceuticals like Silver Bullet and others at infowarslife.com
[01:52:49.080 --> 01:52:52.080]  by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:52:52.080 --> 01:52:56.080]  Again, this is Alex Jones wishing you all a blessed and happy Thanksgiving
[01:52:56.080 --> 01:52:58.080]  and thanking you all for your support of freedom.
[01:52:58.080 --> 01:53:02.080]  We all have our own idea about what being safe and secure means.
[01:53:02.080 --> 01:53:04.080]  The door's locked, bills are paid.
[01:53:04.080 --> 01:53:07.080]  You've got a job that keeps the lights on and a home to call your own.
[01:53:07.080 --> 01:53:10.080]  But what happens when Mother Nature throws a curveball?
[01:53:10.080 --> 01:53:12.080]  I'm calling you to paint cover.
[01:53:12.080 --> 01:53:17.080]  Are you prepared to live without electricity or passable roads for weeks at a time?
[01:53:17.080 --> 01:53:19.080]  Do you even have a plan B?
[01:53:19.080 --> 01:53:22.080]  If you do, are you willing to bet your life on it?
[01:53:22.080 --> 01:53:24.080]  Children left with no homes?
[01:53:24.080 --> 01:53:26.080]  And no one's coming to help them.
[01:53:26.080 --> 01:53:31.080]  The first step towards self-reliance in the face of disaster is a visit to mypatriotsupply.com.
[01:53:31.080 --> 01:53:36.080]  There you'll find the absolute best prices on storeable foods, non-GMO seeds,

[01:53:49.080 --> 01:53:52.080]  Or visit us at mypatriotsupply.com.
[01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:54.080]  Remember before it's time to survive.
[01:53:54.080 --> 01:54:20.080]  It's time to prepare.
[01:54:20.080 --> 01:54:27.080]  But it wasn't because I didn't know anything.
[01:54:27.080 --> 01:54:30.080]  I knew too much.
[01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:38.080]  Does that make me crazy? Does it? Does that make Gary Webb crazy?
[01:54:38.080 --> 01:54:40.080]  I think it does make me crazy.
[01:54:40.080 --> 01:54:44.080]  Because if you're in a land of nuts, that makes you crazy. You don't go along with them.
[01:54:44.080 --> 01:54:48.080]  Reuters reports U.S. states, pot legalization,
[01:54:48.080 --> 01:54:52.080]  non-inline with international law, U.N. says we can't decriminalize marijuana.
[01:54:52.080 --> 01:54:54.080]  See how we're going under global government?
[01:54:54.080 --> 01:54:58.080]  Obama says he'll put carbon taxes in on us, even if Congress doesn't agree.
[01:54:58.080 --> 01:55:03.080]  Said that in China. See how we're living under these foreign banks' control.
[01:55:03.080 --> 01:55:05.080]  Parties come and go, but this continues.
[01:55:05.080 --> 01:55:07.080]  Look at this. This came out a few months ago.
[01:55:07.080 --> 01:55:11.080]  CIA admits destroying Gary Webb's career with the country's largest newspapers.
[01:55:11.080 --> 01:55:13.080]  We're going to talk about that next hour with our guests.
[01:55:13.080 --> 01:55:15.080]  We're going to get into a whole bunch of important news.
[01:55:15.080 --> 01:55:18.080]  Here's the latest story at infowars.com.
[01:55:18.080 --> 01:55:24.080]  Russia announces deployment of bombers over the Gulf of Mexico as a new Cold War kicks off.
[01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:30.080]  Survey. Americans have smartened up to mass government spying and are totally against the NSA.
[01:55:30.080 --> 01:55:34.080]  D.C. School strips Christmas from calendar after Muslims complain.
[01:55:34.080 --> 01:55:38.080]  China jails CIA's e-moms.
[01:55:38.080 --> 01:55:42.080]  And we have a second video emerging of the Obamacare architect calling American people stupid
[01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:49.080]  admitting it's a rip-off continuing in the U.N. causing all sorts of sterilization.
[01:55:49.080 --> 01:55:51.080]  They've been caught doing that.
[01:55:51.080 --> 01:55:55.080]  That's just some of the news up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:55:55.080 --> 01:55:58.080]  Free Ricky Ross is our guest.
[01:55:58.080 --> 01:56:02.080]  He, of course, is played by a fictional, well, not a fictional character.
[01:56:02.080 --> 01:56:07.080]  He's played by an actor in an account of the real-life events that happen.
[01:56:07.080 --> 01:56:12.080]  A documentary until the messenger of the hit movie out about the late Gary Webb.
[01:56:12.080 --> 01:56:18.080]  I want to hit this right now before we talk about what the CIA said to you about your message to young people
[01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:21.080]  about where you see the country and the world going.
[01:56:21.080 --> 01:56:25.080]  Then I want to open the phones up because they'll ask a lot of questions that I didn't think to ask.
[01:56:25.080 --> 01:56:32.080]  We're also going to send out a Twitter hashtag so folks can respond just whatever they want to come up with
[01:56:32.080 --> 01:56:36.080]  to ask questions of Rick Ross who's in studio with us.
[01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:41.080]  But in the few minutes we have before break, Rick, we've talked a lot about this.
[01:56:41.080 --> 01:56:43.080]  He was coming out with a new book.
[01:56:43.080 --> 01:56:45.080]  He was talking to me.
[01:56:45.080 --> 01:56:47.080]  He wasn't ready to come back on until his new book came out.
[01:56:47.080 --> 01:56:51.080]  He wanted me to put an online bibliography up of a bunch of documents.
[01:56:51.080 --> 01:56:54.080]  He was talking to a bunch of other people.
[01:56:54.080 --> 01:56:55.080]  He was talking to you.
[01:56:55.080 --> 01:57:01.080]  I talked to you right after they killed him or he committed suicide, as they say, in jail.
[01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:02.080]  You didn't buy it.
[01:57:02.080 --> 01:57:04.080]  He told you they'd been breaking in his house.
[01:57:04.080 --> 01:57:06.080]  He'd had to move. They threatened him.
[01:57:06.080 --> 01:57:11.080]  I liked how the movie basically implies they killed him, but it ends before they kill him.
[01:57:11.080 --> 01:57:14.080]  This story of him shooting himself twice in the head.
[01:57:14.080 --> 01:57:16.080]  What did Gary Webb talk to you before he died?
[01:57:16.080 --> 01:57:19.080]  He talked to me about how he was very excited.
[01:57:19.080 --> 01:57:21.080]  He had all the proof to back up what he said.
[01:57:21.080 --> 01:57:23.080]  Yeah, he told me he was going to keep going.
[01:57:23.080 --> 01:57:28.080]  He was going to get to the bottom of it and that he wasn't going to stop until he was done with it.
[01:57:28.080 --> 01:57:33.080]  He did tell me about a new book that he was working on and he asked me if I would be a part of that as well.
[01:57:33.080 --> 01:57:40.080]  I was talking to Kevin Booth when Kevin Booth is the one who told me about what happened to Gary.
[01:57:40.080 --> 01:57:42.080]  I was like, what? I couldn't believe it.
[01:57:42.080 --> 01:57:50.080]  Right after when I spoke to you, and that's when you asked me on air, was I thinking about committing suicide?
[01:57:50.080 --> 01:57:52.080]  I was like, no, where did that come from?
[01:57:52.080 --> 01:57:56.080]  I didn't really understand what she was doing until after I went back to myself and I thought about it.
[01:57:56.080 --> 01:58:00.080]  What you were doing was making sure that everybody knew that I was thinking right,
[01:58:00.080 --> 01:58:05.080]  that I wasn't planning on killing myself and that I was stable and what not.
[01:58:05.080 --> 01:58:08.080]  Yeah, I'm never going to commit suicide. You're never going to commit suicide?
[01:58:08.080 --> 01:58:09.080]  No, no, never.
[01:58:09.080 --> 01:58:12.080]  So you get shot twice in the head and you didn't do it?
[01:58:12.080 --> 01:58:15.080]  I love my, absolutely. If I get shot once in the head.
[01:58:15.080 --> 01:58:18.080]  Gary Webb, do you think they killed him?
[01:58:18.080 --> 01:58:20.080]  I mean, it looks like it to me.
[01:58:20.080 --> 01:58:28.080]  I mean, I'm not a forensic or anything like that, so I really can't say if it's possible that somebody can shoot themselves in the head twice.
[01:58:28.080 --> 01:58:32.080]  But it just seems odd to me that a person could take a gun.
[01:58:32.080 --> 01:58:36.080]  Because I shot a gun before and you shoot it and the gun does like this here.
[01:58:36.080 --> 01:58:38.080]  Stay there, we're going to talk more about it.
[01:58:38.080 --> 01:58:55.080]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:55.080 --> 01:59:10.080]  You've got the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:59:10.080 --> 01:59:13.080]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory.
[01:59:13.080 --> 01:59:16.080]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called Info Wars.
[01:59:16.080 --> 01:59:18.080]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:59:18.080 --> 01:59:20.080]  These people are assaulting us.
[01:59:20.080 --> 01:59:25.080]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:59:25.080 --> 01:59:29.080]  They're never going to stop. They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[01:59:39.080 --> 01:59:41.080]  You got a censor eye on the enemy.
[01:59:41.080 --> 01:59:43.080]  Not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:59:43.080 --> 01:59:51.080]  Electrally, it's for God you can fail it.
[01:59:51.080 --> 02:00:05.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:05.080 --> 02:00:06.080]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.080 --> 02:00:08.080]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.080 --> 02:00:10.080]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.080 --> 02:00:11.080]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.080 --> 02:00:13.080]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.080 --> 02:00:17.080]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.080 --> 02:00:31.080]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:31.080 --> 02:00:34.080]  Man, I tell you, you ought to hear what we're discussing during the breaks.
[02:00:34.080 --> 02:00:38.080]  Rick Ross on the ground floor of the CIA crack cocaine epidemic.
[02:00:38.080 --> 02:00:42.080]  He wants to get into hip-hop and now it's a weapon.
[02:00:42.080 --> 02:00:45.080]  And of course, a lot of insiders like Professor Griff and others have documented that.
[02:00:45.080 --> 02:00:48.080]  I've talked to famous people that I can't say their names.
[02:00:48.080 --> 02:00:53.080]  Multiple major rock and roll stars who were in the meetings at MTV where they said,
[02:00:53.080 --> 02:00:55.080]  sorry, rock and roll is gone.
[02:00:55.080 --> 02:00:58.080]  We're bringing in the hip-hop gangster rap and we're weaponizing it.
[02:00:58.080 --> 02:01:00.080]  That's the word from the chiefs.
[02:01:00.080 --> 02:01:01.080]  And boy, they've done a job.
[02:01:01.080 --> 02:01:03.080]  So that's coming up in the next segment.
[02:01:03.080 --> 02:01:09.080]  I want to talk to Gary Webb when you went to the premiere, hung out with Renner, who also helped finance it, did a great job.
[02:01:09.080 --> 02:01:14.080]  Knowing the story as good as I do, I was really freaked out because it was so accurate.
[02:01:14.080 --> 02:01:17.080]  Obviously, they couldn't show everything, but it was so out.
[02:01:17.080 --> 02:01:19.080]  They really, I think, captured his spirit.
[02:01:19.080 --> 02:01:21.080]  I really admire Renner now.
[02:01:21.080 --> 02:01:22.080]  I do, too.
[02:01:22.080 --> 02:01:27.080]  And I met Renner at the screen in me, him and Michael and the director and the head producer.
[02:01:27.080 --> 02:01:29.080]  We all took photos and whatnot.
[02:01:29.080 --> 02:01:33.080]  It's like, almost like Gary was there, you know what I'm saying?
[02:01:33.080 --> 02:01:35.080]  Gary's wife was there, his kids were there.
[02:01:35.080 --> 02:01:41.080]  So for me, it was an opportunity to meet people that I had never met before, but I spoke on the phone.
[02:01:41.080 --> 02:01:52.080]  And to meet his wife and his kids and just the whole environment was like, man, everything that Gary was doing was still alive, you know, to know that he hadn't died.
[02:01:52.080 --> 02:01:56.080]  I wonder how his so-called friends at the newspaper that turned their back on him.
[02:01:56.080 --> 02:02:00.080]  I wonder how they feel now being so famous in this film.
[02:02:00.080 --> 02:02:05.080]  Well, yeah, you know, I spoke to Jesse Katz about his role, you know, inside the film.
[02:02:05.080 --> 02:02:13.080]  And, you know, we have Jesse inside of our documentary where he apologizes for basically being a hired gun.
[02:02:13.080 --> 02:02:21.080]  And gunning Gary down, he was saying that that's one of the lowest points that he felt in his journalism that he did that.
[02:02:21.080 --> 02:02:23.080]  That was the editor of the LA Times.
[02:02:23.080 --> 02:02:25.080]  It was the guy.
[02:02:25.080 --> 02:02:27.080]  Well, he's not a bin, but he hired Jesse.
[02:02:27.080 --> 02:02:29.080]  No, no, I understand, but it actually comes out in the film.
[02:02:29.080 --> 02:02:31.080]  They're saying, well, the LA Times says this.
[02:02:31.080 --> 02:02:33.080]  He goes, well, yeah, but he's CIA.
[02:02:33.080 --> 02:02:37.080]  And, you know, of course, he was never discredited.
[02:02:37.080 --> 02:02:41.080]  That's why they had to kill him because they tried to kill him in the media.
[02:02:41.080 --> 02:02:43.080]  And then that didn't work.
[02:02:43.080 --> 02:02:44.080]  So they just killed him.
[02:02:44.080 --> 02:02:46.080]  Well, you know, the Internet saved the story.
[02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:50.080]  I mean, if it wasn't for the Internet, the story would have been dead, you know, from the start.
[02:02:50.080 --> 02:02:57.080]  But the thing about it was so good is that it was the first time a major newspaper had ever released a story on the Internet.
[02:02:57.080 --> 02:03:03.080]  So once it hit that Internet, you know, it just started going from person to person to person to person.
[02:03:03.080 --> 02:03:08.080]  And, you know, another thing, it was the first time that blacks had ever really came out on the Internet the way they did.
[02:03:08.080 --> 02:03:10.080]  They really came out and...
[02:03:10.080 --> 02:03:16.080]  Oh, let's talk about that when we come back and then we'll get into the hip-hop and your message to the young people.
[02:03:16.080 --> 02:03:22.080]  But we ought to find those clips like where Mike Rupert confronts the CIA director and Maxine Waters does.
[02:03:22.080 --> 02:03:26.080]  You can find it online like Mike Rupert confronts CIA director and Maxine Waters does.
[02:03:26.080 --> 02:03:29.080]  And Deutch just shuts down and then had to quit after that.
[02:03:29.080 --> 02:03:30.080]  I mean, people were mad.
[02:03:30.080 --> 02:03:32.080]  They're like, you put this on our streets? That was powerful.
[02:03:32.080 --> 02:03:33.080]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:03:33.080 --> 02:03:36.080]  When he came down to South Central at Locke High School.
[02:03:36.080 --> 02:03:37.080]  I want to get your take.
[02:03:37.080 --> 02:03:39.080]  We'll start talking about that some.
[02:03:39.080 --> 02:03:44.080]  Well, you know, he came to South Central because it was such an hour in South Central LA, you know.
[02:03:44.080 --> 02:03:47.080]  Blacks were mobilizing and they wanted something done.
[02:03:47.080 --> 02:03:48.080]  You know, they wanted answers.
[02:03:48.080 --> 02:03:50.080]  People had kids in prison and...
[02:03:50.080 --> 02:03:53.080]  I mean, you know, it really devastated the black community.
[02:03:53.080 --> 02:03:59.080]  You know, right now we have 600,000 black men in prison for selling drugs.
[02:03:59.080 --> 02:04:00.080]  No violence.
[02:04:00.080 --> 02:04:02.080]  You know, not rapes, not robberies.
[02:04:02.080 --> 02:04:03.080]  Just drugs.
[02:04:03.080 --> 02:04:06.080]  You know, marijuana, cocaine.
[02:04:06.080 --> 02:04:09.080]  And these people wanted the answers.
[02:04:09.080 --> 02:04:11.080]  They wanted to know why were the kids taken away so long?
[02:04:11.080 --> 02:04:18.080]  You know, I have about 11 friends that's been in prison right now, 26 years from selling drugs.
[02:04:18.080 --> 02:04:20.080]  20, maybe even 30, some of them.
[02:04:20.080 --> 02:04:22.080]  So people wanted answers.
[02:04:22.080 --> 02:04:27.080]  And Dutch felt that it would be better to address it than to let it keep simmering.
[02:04:27.080 --> 02:04:33.080]  And a big mistake he made, you know, by coming to South Central and confronting those people because they really gave it to him.
[02:04:33.080 --> 02:04:38.080]  We're going to play the clips of Mike Rupert and others.
[02:04:38.080 --> 02:04:41.080]  And I guess it was, it was Maxine Waters visiting you in your cell.
[02:04:41.080 --> 02:04:43.080]  Who was the congresswoman that was there at that time?
[02:04:43.080 --> 02:04:45.080]  Anita McDowell. Maxine Waters was there too.
[02:04:45.080 --> 02:04:46.080]  That's right, okay. I'm going from memory here.
[02:04:46.080 --> 02:04:47.080]  They both was there.
[02:04:47.080 --> 02:04:50.080]  But they did find the clips. We'll play those when we come back.
[02:04:50.080 --> 02:04:53.080]  And we'll give the phone number out so you can have your questions and comments.
[02:04:53.080 --> 02:04:56.080]  And we'll take your Twitter questions at realalexchones.
[02:04:56.080 --> 02:05:24.080]  Stay with us.
[02:05:26.080 --> 02:05:28.080]  Just won't quit.
[02:05:57.080 --> 02:06:00.080]  Another major health threat.
[02:06:00.080 --> 02:06:05.080]  This one in Toledo, Ohio where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:06:05.080 --> 02:06:08.080]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:06:08.080 --> 02:06:15.080]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:06:15.080 --> 02:06:18.080]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:06:18.080 --> 02:06:21.080]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:06:21.080 --> 02:06:26.080]  Here in a supermarket in Toledo, you can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:06:26.080 --> 02:06:31.080]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:06:31.080 --> 02:06:35.080]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:06:35.080 --> 02:06:38.080]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[02:08:22.080 --> 02:08:28.080]  I am a former Los Angeles police narcotics detective, and I work south-central Los Angeles.
[02:08:28.080 --> 02:08:30.080]  And I will tell you, Director Deutsch emphatically.
[02:08:30.080 --> 02:08:34.080]  Have this been further into the mic, sir? These mics don't seem to be...
[02:08:34.080 --> 02:08:38.080]  I will tell you, Director Deutsch, as a former Los Angeles police narcotics detective,
[02:08:38.080 --> 02:08:56.080]  that the agency has dealt drugs throughout this country for a long time.
[02:08:56.080 --> 02:09:03.080]  All right. All right. All right. Obviously, that is an answer for a lot of you.
[02:09:03.080 --> 02:09:07.080]  Now, can you please... All right. Now, can you please...
[02:09:07.080 --> 02:09:09.080]  I refer to it.
[02:09:09.080 --> 02:09:11.080]  Wait, wait, wait.
[02:09:11.080 --> 02:09:15.080]  Wait a minute.
[02:09:20.080 --> 02:09:22.080]  Wait a minute.
[02:09:22.080 --> 02:09:25.080]  Wait a minute here.
[02:09:25.080 --> 02:09:31.080]  Wait a minute. If you don't like what's going on here, please leave now.
[02:09:31.080 --> 02:09:39.080]  No, no, no, no. Leave now, because there are others who do want to hear what's going on in this room.
[02:09:39.080 --> 02:09:43.080]  All right. You can watch an hour of that famous c-span footage.
[02:09:43.080 --> 02:09:47.080]  And, of course, it made Deutsch resign a few weeks later.
[02:09:47.080 --> 02:09:51.080]  And then it caused an Inspector General report, and they admitted it.
[02:09:51.080 --> 02:09:57.080]  It all came out. That's the thing. People say, oh, Government Involvement 911 will come out. It has.
[02:09:57.080 --> 02:10:00.080]  Government Involvement sterilizing people will come out. It has.
[02:10:00.080 --> 02:10:03.080]  Government Involvement shipping drugs in will come out. It has.
[02:10:03.080 --> 02:10:09.080]  It came out in the 60s on the opium, the heroin, in Southeast Asia.
[02:10:09.080 --> 02:10:11.080]  It's come out in Afghanistan.
[02:10:11.080 --> 02:10:16.080]  It went from 7% of world opium production in Afghanistan to 93%.
[02:10:16.080 --> 02:10:20.080]  That's the UN's own report, after our liberation of it.
[02:10:20.080 --> 02:10:24.080]  I don't need to play the Fox News Clips again, or CNN, or ABC, them admitting our trips.
[02:10:24.080 --> 02:10:27.080]  Guard and grow the opium.
[02:10:27.080 --> 02:10:34.080]  You understand that, folks? And then, if your son or daughter is dumb enough to get on heroin,
[02:10:34.080 --> 02:10:40.080]  God forbid, or unlucky enough, they're going to throw them in jail when they shipped it in?
[02:10:40.080 --> 02:10:42.080]  That's crazy.
[02:10:42.080 --> 02:10:47.080]  That'd be like if you were a mafia don and ordered one of your guys to go rob a bank,
[02:10:47.080 --> 02:10:51.080]  and then the mafia don shows up in a police outfit and takes you to jail for robbing the bank
[02:10:51.080 --> 02:10:54.080]  when he publicly ordered them to do that.
[02:10:54.080 --> 02:10:58.080]  Furue Ricky Ross is our guest. He wouldn't sell out Gary Webb and others,
[02:10:58.080 --> 02:11:01.080]  so they kept him in prison a lot longer than he should have been there.
[02:11:01.080 --> 02:11:07.080]  And again, I don't glorify drug dealing, but it's the fact that it's illegal that puts all this money into it.
[02:11:07.080 --> 02:11:10.080]  You regulate it. You make it a shameful thing to do.
[02:11:10.080 --> 02:11:14.080]  You don't have all these Hollywood movies promoting it on purpose to prime the pump,
[02:11:14.080 --> 02:11:15.080]  and it will go away.
[02:11:15.080 --> 02:11:19.080]  Areas of Europe have done that, and drug abuse has gone down about 50%.
[02:11:19.080 --> 02:11:23.080]  So it's because I don't like drugs. Folks, I don't use drugs.
[02:11:23.080 --> 02:11:28.080]  I get prescriptions sometimes, you know, if I'm sick, I drink coffee, I drink tea.
[02:11:28.080 --> 02:11:31.080]  Occasionally I drink beer or wine, but I mean, that's it.
[02:11:31.080 --> 02:11:35.080]  It's the drug dealers that are currently operating in government and big banks,
[02:11:35.080 --> 02:11:38.080]  and then low-level ones, they don't want it to be made legal or decriminalized.
[02:11:38.080 --> 02:11:42.080]  Rick Ross is our guest. We're going to be taking your phone calls coming up.
[02:11:42.080 --> 02:11:44.080]  It's the Sunday phone number today.
[02:11:44.080 --> 02:11:46.080]  We're running the whole show out of our operation.
[02:11:46.080 --> 02:11:53.080]  877-789-ALX, 877-789-2539. Callers for Rick Ross.
[02:11:53.080 --> 02:11:59.080]  877-789-ALX, 877-789-2539.
[02:11:59.080 --> 02:12:04.080]  And we've got your Twitter questions coming in at hashtag Rick Ross.
[02:12:04.080 --> 02:12:10.080]  Just tweet at us with hashtag Rick Ross on the IW chats at Real Alex Jones on Twitter.
[02:12:10.080 --> 02:12:12.080]  We've already got some of those questions pouring in.
[02:12:12.080 --> 02:12:17.080]  Rick, other points you want to make, and then I know you want to get into hip-hop,
[02:12:17.080 --> 02:12:23.080]  that you say is the new crack cocaine epidemic culture war machine,
[02:12:23.080 --> 02:12:30.080]  and then I've got some amazing testimony I can give you on that exact fact backing up what you have to say.
[02:12:30.080 --> 02:12:32.080]  Tell folks what you told me off air.
[02:12:32.080 --> 02:12:38.080]  Well, I believe that what they've done is they've taken hip-hop and they've made it glorious to be a drug dealer.
[02:12:38.080 --> 02:12:40.080]  You know, when I sold drugs, I hid.
[02:12:40.080 --> 02:12:42.080]  I didn't want anybody to know I sold drugs.
[02:12:42.080 --> 02:12:47.080]  But now they got these guys who've never sold drugs, technically, you know.
[02:12:47.080 --> 02:12:51.080]  One guy was a correctional officer who goes by the name of Rick Ross now.
[02:12:51.080 --> 02:12:54.080]  He took my whole identity and the court said that he could do it.
[02:12:54.080 --> 02:12:59.080]  And he could press around the country and say that he's me and take my whole life and use it.
[02:12:59.080 --> 02:13:02.080]  And there was nothing I could do about it. I can't stop him.
[02:13:02.080 --> 02:13:04.080]  He even grew a beard just like you.
[02:13:04.080 --> 02:13:05.080]  Everything.
[02:13:05.080 --> 02:13:14.080]  So now they take these guys and these guys said, well, I got to the position that I'm in right now today by selling drugs.
[02:13:14.080 --> 02:13:20.080]  So the message that it tells our kids is that if you go out, you sell drugs,
[02:13:20.080 --> 02:13:26.080]  then you can become a great rock star like myself and never go to prison.
[02:13:26.080 --> 02:13:32.080]  And I think that that's a false message to be given people who feel hopeless.
[02:13:32.080 --> 02:13:35.080]  They don't indict the people that are fake and claim all that.
[02:13:35.080 --> 02:13:42.080]  No, no, they want them out there like a lantern fish has that light to get little fish to swim over so they can eat them.
[02:13:42.080 --> 02:13:44.080]  Exactly. And that's what I believe.
[02:13:44.080 --> 02:13:51.080]  I mean, if I were to go on tape and say, oh, yeah, I sold 300 kilos of cocaine and now you got me admitting that I did that,
[02:13:51.080 --> 02:13:53.080]  they would indict me for it.
[02:13:53.080 --> 02:13:56.080]  But the way they're doing it now, they say it's just art form.
[02:13:56.080 --> 02:13:57.080]  It's just a form of art.
[02:13:57.080 --> 02:14:04.080]  And I believe that it's sucking in our kids and you turn on the radio and it's just filled with it.
[02:14:04.080 --> 02:14:08.080]  What do you want to say to Rick Ross, because you'll probably see this video, the fake Rick Ross?
[02:14:08.080 --> 02:14:20.080]  I would tell him that it's time to change, that it's time to tell the kids the truth and let them know that technically he's never sold drugs
[02:14:20.080 --> 02:14:28.080]  and that he didn't get his money from selling drugs, that Universal gave him the money to do the things that he's doing,
[02:14:28.080 --> 02:14:37.080]  that it's okay to admit that you never did that and not let our kids believe that they can go out and sell drugs and never pay a penalty for doing that.
[02:14:37.080 --> 02:14:42.080]  Does it make you angry to see him doing that?
[02:14:42.080 --> 02:14:51.080]  Well, really, the whole culture, I mean, I'm disappointed in the whole culture, really not really him,
[02:14:51.080 --> 02:14:54.080]  because I don't think that he understands what he's doing.
[02:14:54.080 --> 02:15:02.080]  To him, I believe that he's making a living and he's almost like I was when I sold drugs.
[02:15:02.080 --> 02:15:06.080]  So he don't understand the...
[02:15:06.080 --> 02:15:14.080]  But you were actually doing it and taking the risk, he's out there selling this culture and this idea where young kids are going to go out and get their lives ruined or killed.
[02:15:14.080 --> 02:15:17.080]  In my book, that's a lot worse than what you did.
[02:15:17.080 --> 02:15:20.080]  At least you had your butt hanging out there.
[02:15:20.080 --> 02:15:24.080]  Yeah, and they're getting it to maybe even more people than I did.
[02:15:24.080 --> 02:15:30.080]  Well, notice though, even though these guys are fake gangsters, they're always getting shot up and killed because real gangsters come after them
[02:15:30.080 --> 02:15:35.080]  or other people that think their gangsters come after them, it's totally sick.
[02:15:35.080 --> 02:15:36.080]  Yes, it is.
[02:15:36.080 --> 02:15:39.080]  But then you go to our schools and guess who you hear on the radio?
[02:15:39.080 --> 02:15:43.080]  A plan in a high school gym on the turntables.
[02:15:43.080 --> 02:15:46.080]  Guess who you hear on there? Jay-Z.
[02:15:46.080 --> 02:15:48.080]  Well, I'm glad you're speaking to high schools and colleges.
[02:15:48.080 --> 02:15:50.080]  We need to get you to just thousands of them.
[02:15:50.080 --> 02:15:51.080]  We need to shut this down.
[02:15:51.080 --> 02:15:57.080]  Well, you know, and you say that, it's harder for me to get in with my message than it is for them.
[02:15:57.080 --> 02:16:06.080]  They'll pay these guys $100,000 to come near and tell the kids how much drugs they sold and how glorious it is to sell drugs.
[02:16:06.080 --> 02:16:09.080]  And they don't even want me on campus.
[02:16:09.080 --> 02:16:13.080]  Because you're going to tell them, it's the government, it'll ruin your life, don't touch it.
[02:16:13.080 --> 02:16:16.080]  And by the way, you're going to prison forever if you don't.
[02:16:16.080 --> 02:16:19.080]  And it's that message that will keep kids off drugs.
[02:16:19.080 --> 02:16:21.080]  Not the one of, oh, it's sexy and fun.
[02:16:21.080 --> 02:16:23.080]  You want to get involved in this.
[02:16:23.080 --> 02:16:27.080]  And this is how you really start rolling and getting all the chicks and everything.
[02:16:27.080 --> 02:16:28.080]  No, you're not going to get any of that.
[02:16:28.080 --> 02:16:30.080]  You're going to end up getting TB in a prison cell.
[02:16:30.080 --> 02:16:31.080]  Exactly.
[02:16:31.080 --> 02:16:36.080]  And get your lights cut off at seven o'clock at night.
[02:16:36.080 --> 02:16:43.080]  Told when to get up in the morning, when to go to bed and how to live your life.
[02:16:43.080 --> 02:16:44.080]  It makes me sick.
[02:16:44.080 --> 02:16:46.080]  And they're going to give you a job.
[02:16:46.080 --> 02:16:47.080]  Or you can't get a job on the street.
[02:16:47.080 --> 02:16:49.080]  Oh, they got a job for you in prison.
[02:16:49.080 --> 02:16:51.080]  It's called Unicorn.
[02:16:51.080 --> 02:16:55.080]  You're going to make money, prison money, 25 cents an hour.
[02:16:55.080 --> 02:16:58.080]  And the job that you're going to be doing, skillful job.
[02:16:58.080 --> 02:17:02.080]  Because people on the street, when they get $35 an hour to do that same job.
[02:17:02.080 --> 02:17:05.080]  But we only going to give you 25 cents.
[02:17:05.080 --> 02:17:06.080]  But that's all you need.
[02:17:06.080 --> 02:17:08.080]  Because we're going to feed you.
[02:17:08.080 --> 02:17:09.080]  How's you?
[02:17:09.080 --> 02:17:12.080]  We wash your clothes for you.
[02:17:12.080 --> 02:17:14.080]  You have nothing to worry about in here.
[02:17:14.080 --> 02:17:16.080]  And then the good old boys shit around going out.
[02:17:16.080 --> 02:17:19.080]  Here they got hot tubes and cable in them prisons.
[02:17:19.080 --> 02:17:21.080]  I'll say make them work.
[02:17:21.080 --> 02:17:23.080]  And then they wonder why their son or daughter can't get a job in a factory.
[02:17:23.080 --> 02:17:26.080]  Because the factories are all built on the side of the prisons.
[02:17:26.080 --> 02:17:27.080]  Absolutely.
[02:17:27.080 --> 02:17:28.080]  For 25 cents an hour.
[02:17:28.080 --> 02:17:29.080]  Yep.
[02:17:29.080 --> 02:17:35.080]  And then they charge you as much as 50 cents a minute for a phone call.
[02:17:35.080 --> 02:17:41.080]  So you got to work two hours to talk to your wife or your girlfriend or your son or daughter for two minutes.
[02:17:41.080 --> 02:17:43.080]  Yep.
[02:17:43.080 --> 02:17:45.080]  Absolutely.
[02:17:45.080 --> 02:17:50.080]  You know, visits they only let you visit twice a week.
[02:17:50.080 --> 02:17:52.080]  It is such an evil plan.
[02:17:52.080 --> 02:17:59.080]  And then you may be like I was, you know, where your family is in LA and they got you in Texarkana, Texas.
[02:17:59.080 --> 02:18:01.080]  So you may only see your family once a year.
[02:18:01.080 --> 02:18:04.080]  If you're lucky.
[02:18:04.080 --> 02:18:06.080]  If you're lucky.
[02:18:06.080 --> 02:18:12.080]  You look here about to cry thinking about all those kids getting sucked in by those spiders run by Universal and all the rest of them.
[02:18:12.080 --> 02:18:16.080]  I mean, they're, they're, they're setting up webs to catch kids and put them in that prison.
[02:18:16.080 --> 02:18:17.080]  Absolutely.
[02:18:17.080 --> 02:18:18.080]  Absolutely.
[02:18:18.080 --> 02:18:20.080]  When, you know, they got what they call now.
[02:18:20.080 --> 02:18:23.080]  I just spoke at the conference in San Francisco.
[02:18:23.080 --> 02:18:28.080]  They call it from a head start to the prison pipeline.
[02:18:28.080 --> 02:18:30.080]  So they said they can tell right now.
[02:18:30.080 --> 02:18:36.080]  They got people that say they can tell right now a kid that's in kindergarten if he's going to prison.
[02:18:36.080 --> 02:18:37.080]  Well, I read a report.
[02:18:37.080 --> 02:18:47.080]  It was in mainstream news in New Mexico about two years ago that the biggest prison corporation in the world was financing security at the school and was there admitting they're preparing those kids to go to prison.
[02:18:47.080 --> 02:18:51.080]  That the whole thing is just an induction pipeline right into the prison.
[02:18:51.080 --> 02:18:52.080]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[02:18:52.080 --> 02:18:53.080]  I can't believe it.
[02:18:53.080 --> 02:18:58.080]  I mean, how would people stand around and go for something like this here?
[02:18:58.080 --> 02:19:00.080]  I can't do it.
[02:19:00.080 --> 02:19:04.080]  Well, there are people like Professor Griff and others that are exposing what's happening in hip hop.
[02:19:04.080 --> 02:19:05.080]  Yeah.
[02:19:05.080 --> 02:19:06.080]  Yeah.
[02:19:06.080 --> 02:19:08.080]  I spoke to Professor Griffin.
[02:19:08.080 --> 02:19:10.080]  We're planning on doing some things together.
[02:19:10.080 --> 02:19:12.080]  Yeah, he's a really great guy.
[02:19:12.080 --> 02:19:15.080]  Army veteran, really smart guy trying to expose what's happening.
[02:19:15.080 --> 02:19:18.080]  Well, you know, the record labels are not going to touch those guys though.
[02:19:18.080 --> 02:19:20.080]  Even though they're the real pioneers of hip hop.
[02:19:20.080 --> 02:19:21.080]  Absolutely.
[02:19:21.080 --> 02:19:24.080]  But he can't get a record on the radio.
[02:19:24.080 --> 02:19:25.080]  Totally underground.
[02:19:25.080 --> 02:19:29.080]  It's going to be up to us, you know, at the people in the streets like, you know, what you're doing right now.
[02:19:29.080 --> 02:19:32.080]  I mean, mainstream won't touch me.
[02:19:32.080 --> 02:19:34.080]  They won't give me an interview.
[02:19:34.080 --> 02:19:35.080]  They won't talk to me.
[02:19:35.080 --> 02:19:39.080]  A drug dealer in my studio, never.
[02:19:39.080 --> 02:19:42.080]  Instead, you're the real Rick Ross saying, don't use drugs.
[02:19:42.080 --> 02:19:47.080]  And they got the other Rick Ross running around making kids think it's sexy and they want him in the schools.
[02:19:47.080 --> 02:19:52.080]  That's because the spiders want to get those kids.
[02:19:52.080 --> 02:19:53.080]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:19:53.080 --> 02:19:54.080]  Stay there.
[02:19:54.080 --> 02:19:57.080]  I want to come back, get into anything else you want to cover and take phone calls.
[02:19:57.080 --> 02:19:59.080]  And I'll tell you my story about the inside.
[02:19:59.080 --> 02:20:05.080]  If you have Candida overgrowth, just taking antifungal agents or starving yourself of sweets does not address the cause.
[02:20:05.080 --> 02:20:11.080]  Candida overgrowth is the result of a toxic, damaged, acidic, low oxygen and inflamed tissue environment.
[02:20:11.080 --> 02:20:18.080]  The goal should be to remove the toxins, heal damaged tissues, restore healthy pH, eliminate inflammation and feed beneficial bacteria.
[02:20:18.080 --> 02:20:27.080]  Previous usage of antibiotics or steroids or exposure to mercury or other toxins can damage many cells in the GI tract and body that make you prone to Candida overgrowth.
[02:20:27.080 --> 02:20:30.080]  Removing toxins and healing tissues should be the goal.
[02:20:30.080 --> 02:20:40.080]  One World Way is a whey protein food that supports detoxification, repair of tissues and elimination of inflammation, healthy pH and growth of beneficial bacteria.
[02:20:40.080 --> 02:20:44.080]  One World Way is duly reformulated to be higher in protein and lower in carbohydrate.
[02:20:44.080 --> 02:20:50.080]  We believe One World Way is an excellent food to support your efforts to create a healthy, internal body environment.

[02:20:58.080 --> 02:21:01.080]  Americans, you are being lied to.
[02:21:01.080 --> 02:21:07.080]  Does your skin crawl when a politician or a stock market guru say that we are in the midst of an economic recovery?
[02:21:07.080 --> 02:21:11.080]  According to top insiders, the largest financial meltdown in history is coming.
[02:21:11.080 --> 02:21:15.080]  You can prepare but if you're living paycheck to paycheck, how do you find the cash?
[02:21:15.080 --> 02:21:20.080]  If you're fortunate enough to have retirement savings, it's probably not enough.
[02:21:20.080 --> 02:21:24.080]  And if it's in the market, it could be wiped out just like the last crash.
[02:21:24.080 --> 02:21:27.080]  But this time it will almost certainly be much worse.
[02:21:27.080 --> 02:21:32.080]  Precious metals are a great hedge, but they won't generate immediate cash flow to pay the bills.
[02:21:32.080 --> 02:21:35.080]  Learn the secret to creating cash flow and freedom.

[02:23:26.080 --> 02:23:30.080]  Gold and silver is going up while Congress is trying to settle on the next dead increase.
[02:23:30.080 --> 02:23:32.080]  And there's no end to this madness.
[02:23:32.080 --> 02:23:37.080]  That old 401k and IRA can be converted into physical gold without tax consequences.
[02:23:37.080 --> 02:23:40.080]  I explained this in my book Ten Reasons to Buy Gold.

[02:24:20.080 --> 02:24:23.080]  Rick had more he wanted to say about, quote, dumbing down.
[02:24:23.080 --> 02:24:27.080]  He was describing it like, well, I guess training wheels on the kids right into prison.
[02:24:27.080 --> 02:24:33.080]  Get more into that, Rick Ross. We're talking about hip-hop and how they program the kids on how they're supposed to act.
[02:24:33.080 --> 02:24:39.080]  Well, you know, like myself, Alex, they made me believe that I was dumb, that I couldn't read.
[02:24:39.080 --> 02:24:41.080]  And, you know, people ask me all the time, who was it?
[02:24:41.080 --> 02:24:44.080]  Was it my mom who didn't teach me how to read? Was it the school?
[02:24:44.080 --> 02:24:46.080]  Well, I don't really know.
[02:24:46.080 --> 02:24:58.080]  But what I do know is that I had come up with a mentality about myself, that I was dumb, that I was stupid, that all I should be was a thug.
[02:24:58.080 --> 02:25:02.080]  And that thugging was cool.
[02:25:02.080 --> 02:25:09.080]  And when I looked around from my prison cell and I started to look at all my friends, that they all thought the same way.
[02:25:09.080 --> 02:25:20.080]  And it was this programming that put us in this position that dealing drugs and gang banging was easy for us to accept.
[02:25:20.080 --> 02:25:26.080]  And I believe that hip-hop is doing that right now, but on a more massive scale.
[02:25:26.080 --> 02:25:31.080]  The kids now, they wear their pants like we used to. They talk to things that we used to.
[02:25:31.080 --> 02:25:33.080]  They're ready for prison.
[02:25:33.080 --> 02:25:34.080]  Absolutely.
[02:25:34.080 --> 02:25:35.080]  They're ready to be punked.
[02:25:35.080 --> 02:25:37.080]  Absolutely. Absolutely.
[02:25:37.080 --> 02:25:39.080]  It's at an all-time high rate.
[02:25:39.080 --> 02:25:45.080]  It must be a joke to the CIA mind controllers to have the young guys already wearing their pants saying, hey, I'm ready to be raped.
[02:25:45.080 --> 02:25:50.080]  I mean, they must be really proud of the masterful job they've done.
[02:25:50.080 --> 02:25:56.080]  And now they're deploying that hip-hop culture into everything. It's just taking over.
[02:25:56.080 --> 02:25:59.080]  Oh, absolutely. Endorsements. I mean, big companies.
[02:25:59.080 --> 02:26:04.080]  Companies that wouldn't touch that type of lifestyle before is all over.
[02:26:04.080 --> 02:26:09.080]  They don't want to have kids wearing sports jackets and doing well, and you've got a future, and you're crap.
[02:26:09.080 --> 02:26:13.080]  And now the rock and roll musics, oh, we're all dead. We have no future. Humans are crud.
[02:26:13.080 --> 02:26:19.080]  They need us to feel bad about ourselves, and then we're hurting the earth, so we roll over and basically become slaves.
[02:26:19.080 --> 02:26:20.080]  Absolutely.
[02:26:20.080 --> 02:26:22.080]  Other points you wanted to make before we go to break.
[02:26:22.080 --> 02:26:33.080]  And that's the point that I believe right now that our kids are in, and that's why I'm out here on the streets working to let them know that, you know, I couldn't read, but I eventually started doing law.
[02:26:33.080 --> 02:26:37.080]  You know, I found the issue that eventually helped me get out of prison.
[02:26:37.080 --> 02:26:41.080]  So, you know, I wrote a book now in a couple...
[02:26:41.080 --> 02:26:43.080]  And you're here warning people about drugs right now.
[02:26:43.080 --> 02:26:44.080]  Absolutely.
[02:26:44.080 --> 02:26:51.080]  And that's what matters is you've changed. You understand what you did wrong, and that's more valuable than somebody that never even went through the trials and tribulations.
[02:26:51.080 --> 02:26:52.080]  You're a veteran.
[02:26:52.080 --> 02:26:53.080]  Right.
[02:26:53.080 --> 02:26:57.080]  A veteran of this tyranny, and you're here seeing through the Matrix now. That's a beautiful thing.
[02:26:57.080 --> 02:27:07.080]  It's like Christ is on the cross, and he's there next to the thief and everything, and the thief apologizes, accepts it, his heart's right, and Christ says, tonight, you'll be with me in paradise.
[02:27:07.080 --> 02:27:11.080]  But the soldiers and everybody, they just went along with it.
[02:27:11.080 --> 02:27:12.080]  Yeah.
[02:27:12.080 --> 02:27:15.080]  They think they're winners in this world and they're not.
[02:27:15.080 --> 02:27:18.080]  Absolutely.
[02:27:18.080 --> 02:27:22.080]  Well, we've got to warn the young people to never use drugs the first time.
[02:27:22.080 --> 02:27:27.080]  I mean, marijuana is a gateway, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't decriminalize it just so they can't throw you in jail.
[02:27:27.080 --> 02:27:30.080]  But the whole drug culture is ruining people.
[02:27:30.080 --> 02:27:35.080]  And the prescription drugs are pushing on kids in the schools are worse than the illegal drugs.
[02:27:35.080 --> 02:27:39.080]  And just stay away from them and realize you're not empty if you get bad grades.
[02:27:39.080 --> 02:27:41.080]  And then so you got to go to the dark side.
[02:27:41.080 --> 02:27:44.080]  You're not empty just because you don't have a bunch of money.
[02:27:44.080 --> 02:27:45.080]  You can paint.
[02:27:45.080 --> 02:27:46.080]  You can music.
[02:27:46.080 --> 02:27:48.080]  You can go out and help people.
[02:27:48.080 --> 02:27:58.080]  That's what's going to empower you is going out and standing up to bullies, not just feeling bad because you don't live like people on television.
[02:27:58.080 --> 02:27:59.080]  Yeah.
[02:27:59.080 --> 02:28:01.080]  We all can't be on television.
[02:28:01.080 --> 02:28:07.080]  It's crazy that they tell us that, you know, if you don't have a pair of Air Jordans that you're not special.
[02:28:07.080 --> 02:28:15.080]  Well, I mean, I was happier before I had all this responsibility and was quote on radio and TV and barely had money to buy three pairs of shoes a year, even though that was rich compared to poor people.
[02:28:15.080 --> 02:28:16.080]  I mean, I was totally happy.
[02:28:16.080 --> 02:28:22.080]  I was thinking back to the years when I was out of high school and stuff and parents were giving me no help because I didn't ask for it really.
[02:28:22.080 --> 02:28:23.080]  And I was so poor.
[02:28:23.080 --> 02:28:27.080]  It was the happiest time of my life without all these responsibilities and the rest of it.
[02:28:27.080 --> 02:28:29.080]  And I'm not saying people shouldn't become successful.
[02:28:29.080 --> 02:28:32.080]  It's just that what matters is that you're a good person.
[02:28:32.080 --> 02:28:33.080]  That's the real value.
[02:28:33.080 --> 02:28:34.080]  It is.
[02:28:34.080 --> 02:28:35.080]  It is.
[02:28:35.080 --> 02:28:41.080]  And that you care about others because when you don't care about other people, then I believe that you're the worst.
[02:28:41.080 --> 02:28:47.080]  And a lot of people that that's in power right now, they don't care about anything but your dollars, you know, they enjoy hurting people.
[02:28:47.080 --> 02:28:48.080]  Yeah.
[02:28:48.080 --> 02:28:55.080]  I mean, it's a diabolical plan to ship heroin in to get millions of Americans addicted from the 50s on and then to bring in cocaine weaponized.
[02:28:55.080 --> 02:29:01.080]  It is crack, which is a CIA recipe that was declassified and to deploy it right in the black neighborhoods.
[02:29:01.080 --> 02:29:03.080]  I mean, that's a nasty thing to do.
[02:29:03.080 --> 02:29:04.080]  It is.
[02:29:04.080 --> 02:29:05.080]  Absolutely.
[02:29:05.080 --> 02:29:08.080]  To people that doesn't have that that that's hopeless.
[02:29:08.080 --> 02:29:17.080]  And then to shell them thug culture, because let me tell you, you know, I'm downtown Austin and there's, you know, basically I call them black clan members, whatever, just black thug culture.
[02:29:17.080 --> 02:29:18.080]  There's white thug culture as well.
[02:29:18.080 --> 02:29:19.080]  But they've been sold.
[02:29:19.080 --> 02:29:20.080]  It's okay to hate white people.
[02:29:20.080 --> 02:29:23.080]  I mean, it's, you know, it's, but I don't, I see the plan though.
[02:29:23.080 --> 02:29:27.080]  I see the whole programming to make them like that and to make them hate me.
[02:29:27.080 --> 02:29:31.080]  And then I realize how it's all to divide everybody so the system can manage us.
[02:29:31.080 --> 02:29:32.080]  Yeah.
[02:29:32.080 --> 02:29:33.080]  And that's diabolical.
[02:29:33.080 --> 02:29:34.080]  Absolutely.
[02:29:34.080 --> 02:29:36.080]  That is sick.
[02:29:36.080 --> 02:29:37.080]  That is mind control.
[02:29:37.080 --> 02:29:39.080]  So we've got to transcend it, ladies and gentlemen and defeat it.
[02:29:39.080 --> 02:29:41.080]  We'll get your take on what I just said when we come back.
[02:29:41.080 --> 02:29:44.080]  Rick Ross, go right to your phone calls and your Twitter questions.
[02:29:44.080 --> 02:29:46.080]  I'll stop hogging him right now.
[02:29:46.080 --> 02:29:48.080]  His website is I am the real.
[02:29:48.080 --> 02:29:52.080]  We're on the March, the Empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.080 --> 02:29:55.080]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[02:29:59.080 --> 02:30:03.080]  On the eve of Thanksgiving this year, I was thinking, what am I really thankful for?
[02:30:03.080 --> 02:30:07.080]  And I got to tell you, it's my family, it's all the blessings of liberty that our forebears secured.
[02:30:07.080 --> 02:30:11.080]  And it's you, the listeners of the broadcast who've made everything we do possible.
[02:30:11.080 --> 02:30:17.080]  This Black Friday, I decided to bring you the biggest special we've ever offered on any of the
[02:30:17.080 --> 02:30:19.080]  nutraceuticals at infowarslife.com.
[02:30:19.080 --> 02:30:23.080]  I'm talking about silver bullet, loyal silver that we've been sold out of for months.
[02:30:23.080 --> 02:30:25.080]  This time I doubled down and got even more.
[02:30:25.080 --> 02:30:29.080]  As of me taping this on the eve of Thanksgiving, we have already sold half of them.
[02:30:29.080 --> 02:30:34.080]  So instead of keeping the price at its regular discounted price, we are going to give you 20% off
[02:30:34.080 --> 02:30:36.080]  and free shipping on single bottles.
[02:30:36.080 --> 02:30:40.080]  But if you get four bottles, we're going to give you the fifth one free and the free shipping.
[02:30:40.080 --> 02:30:45.080]  I don't know how long this special will run, but if supplies last, we will extend it out until Cyber Monday.
[02:30:45.080 --> 02:30:49.080]  You'll find powerful nutraceuticals like Silver Bullet and others at infowarslife.com
[02:30:49.080 --> 02:30:52.080]  by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:30:52.080 --> 02:30:56.080]  Again, this is Alex Jones wishing you all a blessed and happy Thanksgiving
[02:30:56.080 --> 02:30:59.080]  and thanking you all for your support of freedom.
[02:31:26.080 --> 02:31:28.080]  Just won't quit.
[02:31:57.080 --> 02:32:00.080]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[02:32:00.080 --> 02:32:04.080]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:32:04.080 --> 02:32:09.080]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[02:32:09.080 --> 02:32:16.080]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth and rejuvenation.
[02:32:16.080 --> 02:32:22.080]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors
[02:32:22.080 --> 02:32:26.080]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:32:26.080 --> 02:32:28.080]  We now have the synergistic solution.
[02:32:28.080 --> 02:32:31.080]  DNA force, just one of the key compounds.
[02:32:31.080 --> 02:32:39.080]  BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies and over 175 PubMed listed published studies.

[02:33:23.080 --> 02:33:25.080]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:33:25.080 --> 02:33:54.080]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:33:55.080 --> 02:33:57.080]  Thank you for watching on some of these points.
[02:33:57.080 --> 02:34:05.080]  You know, one of them, too, you know, Obama, he wrote in the 18 to 1 crack law, you know, where it was 101 for crack and powder,
[02:34:05.080 --> 02:34:13.080]  where it had already been proven that powder and crack are identical drugs, except one is smokable and one is not smokable.
[02:34:13.080 --> 02:34:19.080]  So, about a year ago, they changed it, 18 to 1, but they should have made it 18 to 1 and then they should have made it retroactive.
[02:34:19.080 --> 02:34:27.080]  You know, say if a guy's been in jail 25 or 30 years, but if it was 18 to 1, he would only got 5 years in prison.
[02:34:27.080 --> 02:34:30.080]  So, they would hold him some time, he would be released.
[02:34:30.080 --> 02:34:36.080]  Well, I totally agree. If you're nonviolent, you should be released, period, because the government shipped it in to begin with.
[02:34:36.080 --> 02:34:44.080]  It'd be like if your judge was the guy that sold you the cocaine and then now he's presiding over, sending you to jail for life.
[02:34:44.080 --> 02:34:48.080]  That's what it is. It'd be like if Hitler ran the Nuremberg trials.
[02:34:48.080 --> 02:34:52.080]  I mean, it's just, it's pure bull. I mean, end it.
[02:34:52.080 --> 02:34:53.080]  Yes, it is.
[02:34:53.080 --> 02:34:54.080]  And then they own the prisons.
[02:34:54.080 --> 02:35:00.080]  I remember. I've talked to two major rock stars, and it's not the two that you've heard on the show.
[02:35:00.080 --> 02:35:08.080]  I've talked to two major rock stars, and then I've talked to some hip hop folks, they all say that they've heard the same stories.
[02:35:08.080 --> 02:35:14.080]  And some of the memos have come out about the CIA behind rock and roll to create the revolutions, you know, behind bringing the LSD in.
[02:35:14.080 --> 02:35:19.080]  That's been declassified. But in the early 90s, they said, look, rock's going to be dead. Get ready.
[02:35:19.080 --> 02:35:25.080]  We're going to bring in hip hop and we're going to gangsterize it. This is from the guys upstairs.
[02:35:25.080 --> 02:35:30.080]  The government wants this. Shumner Redstone at Viacom has been ordered to do this.
[02:35:30.080 --> 02:35:35.080]  And big managers and people were all brought in and they said, you better start flipping to this.
[02:35:35.080 --> 02:35:41.080]  That's why you saw a lot of heavy metal guys start doing rap albums and, you know, you know, getting other folks in with them and things,
[02:35:41.080 --> 02:35:46.080]  because they were told we're going to play these on the record and we're going to put this on the air.
[02:35:46.080 --> 02:35:52.080]  And then I talked about my personal self. I experimented here and there once or twice with hard drugs.
[02:35:52.080 --> 02:35:56.080]  Always had such horrible hangovers that, you know, methamphetamine a couple of times, cocaine a few times.
[02:35:56.080 --> 02:36:03.080]  I'm on record about that. I just didn't like it. I've always been a nicotine alcohol type guy and that I've transcended pretty much as well.
[02:36:03.080 --> 02:36:06.080]  Don't even smoke cigars anymore because I always get back on cigarettes when I do.
[02:36:06.080 --> 02:36:15.080]  But long story short, Sheriff McWhorter, who later got busted, he was flying drugs into the Rockwall Airport.
[02:36:15.080 --> 02:36:19.080]  We lived in the richest county in Texas, right outside Dallas, Rockwall, Malay.
[02:36:19.080 --> 02:36:23.080]  And I would be at affluent people's houses for a party when their parents are out of town.
[02:36:23.080 --> 02:36:27.080]  The cheerleader down the streets having a party, all 14-year-olds are over there.
[02:36:27.080 --> 02:36:33.080]  And then there'd be 16-year-olds and 18-year-olds would come over, wild parties, pool parties, and the police car would pull up.
[02:36:33.080 --> 02:36:38.080]  And then they'd come in and go, we got the weed, we got the ecstasy, we got the methamphetamine, we got the...
[02:36:38.080 --> 02:36:42.080]  And I'd be like, whoa, whoa, you know, and because they had money.
[02:36:42.080 --> 02:36:45.080]  And so many times the cops in cars would deliver the drugs.
[02:36:45.080 --> 02:36:49.080]  So I'd get pulled over a couple of years later when I was driving.
[02:36:49.080 --> 02:36:51.080]  That's why we had to move to Austin.
[02:36:51.080 --> 02:36:54.080]  I've told this, this has been an Esquire. It's been in Texas monthly.
[02:36:54.080 --> 02:37:01.080]  They didn't believe a lot. I went and checked and went, wow, there were a bunch of busts in the Rockwall PD and the county and flying in cocaine.
[02:37:01.080 --> 02:37:04.080]  I remember that. I remember that. It was in the newspapers and ready.
[02:37:04.080 --> 02:37:10.080]  So they were flooding it with drugs and they would want to search my car and I'd go, man, I saw you two years ago deliver drugs.
[02:37:10.080 --> 02:37:17.080]  And they would beat me up, take me to jail, threaten to hang me, told my dad's lawyer, move out or we're going to kill him basically.
[02:37:17.080 --> 02:37:18.080]  Yeah.
[02:37:18.080 --> 02:37:21.080]  And a couple years, we moved out and the letter of the feds came in and busted them.
[02:37:21.080 --> 02:37:25.080]  But again, that's the big drug dealer, busting the little drug dealer.
[02:37:25.080 --> 02:37:29.080]  Yeah, well, you know, that's why they don't like you, Alice, because you're going to keep it 100.
[02:37:29.080 --> 02:37:31.080]  You're going to let them know exactly what's going on.
[02:37:31.080 --> 02:37:35.080]  Well, I wasn't saying anything about the cop stealing drugs till they wanted to search me.
[02:37:35.080 --> 02:37:36.080]  Yeah.
[02:37:36.080 --> 02:37:42.080]  And I'm like, man, you're a drug dealer. Leave my six pack of beer alone.
[02:37:42.080 --> 02:37:48.080]  Oh, look, you know, like under the truck seat, those, those Silverado's at the seat that lifted up the middle.
[02:37:48.080 --> 02:37:49.080]  Yeah.
[02:37:49.080 --> 02:37:53.080]  And there was the six pack. We weren't even drinking and driving. We were going to a party and they're like, all right, I got you.
[02:37:53.080 --> 02:37:57.080]  Minor possession. I was just like, you're a drug dealer.
[02:37:57.080 --> 02:38:00.080]  Almost like the Fox watching the in-house.
[02:38:00.080 --> 02:38:04.080]  Well, yeah, it's like, you're a drug dealer. You're going to give me a ticket, take my beer.
[02:38:04.080 --> 02:38:08.080]  Those cops would just go, they arrested me three times doing that.
[02:38:08.080 --> 02:38:09.080]  Wow.
[02:38:09.080 --> 02:38:11.080]  They would, man, they would, they would meet me up that bad.
[02:38:11.080 --> 02:38:13.080]  They'd slam my head in the wall and they'd take me there and go, listen.
[02:38:13.080 --> 02:38:15.080]  You didn't beat you with a flashlight.
[02:38:15.080 --> 02:38:16.080]  No, no, you've been beat up before.
[02:38:16.080 --> 02:38:20.080]  I've been beat with a flashlight while I was handcuffed and let the dog bite me while I was handcuffed.
[02:38:20.080 --> 02:38:27.080]  I mean, these guys are wild, wild with, you know, these, what do you call them? Cowboys?
[02:38:27.080 --> 02:38:28.080]  Yeah.
[02:38:28.080 --> 02:38:31.080]  These drug enforcement agents, you know, they just out there, man.
[02:38:31.080 --> 02:38:33.080]  Most of them are dealers.
[02:38:33.080 --> 02:38:40.080]  Yeah. Running rampant and, you know, ripping off the public because they're not solving the problem.
[02:38:40.080 --> 02:38:43.080]  Well, now they're so arrogant even the New York Times reports on it.
[02:38:43.080 --> 02:38:47.080]  They're taking people's cash out of their wallets that have no criminal record, no drugs.
[02:38:47.080 --> 02:38:49.080]  They just go, oh, two grand in your wallet. Bam. I'm taking it.
[02:38:49.080 --> 02:38:53.080]  Well, you know, Gary stopped that too. You remember they used to have a for fixture.
[02:38:53.080 --> 02:38:54.080]  Remember the for fixture?
[02:38:54.080 --> 02:38:55.080]  He got it kicked out of the States. Yeah.
[02:38:55.080 --> 02:38:57.080]  He made them change their for fixture laws.
[02:38:57.080 --> 02:39:05.080]  You know, before they could pull you over and say they found a joint in your car and they could take your car and forfeit it.
[02:39:05.080 --> 02:39:10.080]  When you go to court and the court throw your case out and you never go to jail or never found guilty.
[02:39:10.080 --> 02:39:15.080]  He did get it reformed, but now they came back where the feds federalize it and they do it now through the police.
[02:39:15.080 --> 02:39:17.080]  Gary did do so much. Let's go to these calls here.
[02:39:17.080 --> 02:39:26.080]  Folks, get his book. It's available right now at infowarstore.com or you can go to freewayrick.com or I am the real Rick Ross dot com and get the book.
[02:39:26.080 --> 02:39:32.080]  Rick Ross, the untold autobiography and give it to the young people in your life, especially any of their getting on drugs.
[02:39:32.080 --> 02:39:35.080]  Donnie McClure asked the question on Twitter.
[02:39:35.080 --> 02:39:38.080]  Can you elaborate on the rapper Rick Ross and how he stole your image?
[02:39:38.080 --> 02:39:42.080]  I think you already answered that and do you like his music? Do you like his music?
[02:39:42.080 --> 02:39:44.080]  I do. I do. You can't help it.
[02:39:44.080 --> 02:39:50.080]  I mean, they have a formula that they're doing with this music and you know, our heart beats off of a rhythm.
[02:39:50.080 --> 02:39:52.080]  So they manipulate us here?
[02:39:52.080 --> 02:40:02.080]  Absolutely. So and then you hear the music if you turn on the radio and I don't really do the radio and I like it, you know, because you can't help but hear this music everywhere you go.
[02:40:02.080 --> 02:40:07.080]  You know, you're an elevator, you're here, you're in the supermarket, you ride down the street and somebody else is playing in the car.
[02:40:07.080 --> 02:40:10.080]  Well, that's what makes me mad is my kids can't help but like it.
[02:40:10.080 --> 02:40:11.080]  Absolutely.
[02:40:11.080 --> 02:40:14.080]  And if the message was going to be great, but it's weaponized, the message is bad.
[02:40:14.080 --> 02:40:20.080]  Yeah, it's not motivation uplifting, you know, telling that you can be somebody special and that you are special no matter what situation.
[02:40:20.080 --> 02:40:24.080]  No, it's like you got to be a gangster slinging a rock to hose the, you know.
[02:40:24.080 --> 02:40:27.080]  And you got it.
[02:40:27.080 --> 02:40:29.080]  Yeah.
[02:40:29.080 --> 02:40:34.080]  Rick Ross, did you do any business with the CIA? Well, that's a silly question.
[02:40:34.080 --> 02:40:36.080]  Not knowingly.
[02:40:36.080 --> 02:40:38.080]  Yeah, they had an intermediary between you and them.
[02:40:38.080 --> 02:40:42.080]  Yeah, yeah, Danilo Blandon, the CIA operative is what they call it.
[02:40:42.080 --> 02:40:44.080]  He's not an agent, but he's an operative.
[02:40:44.080 --> 02:40:48.080]  It's a membrane.
[02:40:48.080 --> 02:40:50.080]  Do you know Henry Hill?
[02:40:50.080 --> 02:40:55.080]  Was or ever met Henry Hill and if so, how much of a piece of bleep was young know who that is?
[02:40:55.080 --> 02:40:56.080]  No, me either.
[02:40:56.080 --> 02:40:57.080]  Never heard of it.
[02:40:57.080 --> 02:40:58.080]  All right.
[02:40:58.080 --> 02:41:00.080]  We've got more Twitter questions coming in.
[02:41:00.080 --> 02:41:02.080]  We're going to go to calls.
[02:41:02.080 --> 02:41:07.080]  MKT says, what was your first major purchase after making all your drug money?
[02:41:07.080 --> 02:41:09.080]  My first major purchase.
[02:41:09.080 --> 02:41:12.080]  I bought a piece of property that I built a motel on.
[02:41:12.080 --> 02:41:13.080]  That's smart.
[02:41:13.080 --> 02:41:21.080]  Adam Russell asked on iChats, Rick, do you think the government was involved in creating the fake rappers persona to basically troll you?
[02:41:21.080 --> 02:41:22.080]  Sure.
[02:41:22.080 --> 02:41:24.080]  I don't think Rick Ross came up with that.
[02:41:24.080 --> 02:41:28.080]  I don't know if they did it to, I don't know what troll me mean.
[02:41:28.080 --> 02:41:35.080]  But what I know that happened is they gave it him authenticity, you know, where it was authentic.
[02:41:35.080 --> 02:41:44.080]  Yeah, where in my community, I'm a legend, you know, people's mothers and fathers had talked about me.
[02:41:44.080 --> 02:41:47.080]  So it had already been ingrained in people that Rick Ross was something.
[02:41:47.080 --> 02:41:56.080]  And so when the name came out, people automatically liked that name because they, they looked at me as, as almost like a Robin Hood.
[02:41:56.080 --> 02:41:58.080]  Well, Rick Ross rolls off the tongue.
[02:41:58.080 --> 02:41:59.080]  It sounds cool.
[02:41:59.080 --> 02:42:00.080]  Yeah.
[02:42:00.080 --> 02:42:07.080]  But when they did him, he already had love for the community, the community already had love for him.
[02:42:07.080 --> 02:42:16.080]  I don't know if you know who Freddie Fox is, but Freddie Fox told me one time he was like, man, when I heard that Rick Ross was performing in New York, I went to the show.
[02:42:16.080 --> 02:42:20.080]  And when I got to the show, I see this guy and I was like, that ain't none of my man.
[02:42:20.080 --> 02:42:24.080]  You know, that's so they already had a love for Rick Ross.
[02:42:24.080 --> 02:42:33.080]  What he did is he got that love that the streets have for me, you know, because I was a gangster, I was out there in the streets and that's what they wanted.
[02:42:33.080 --> 02:42:35.080]  And he fitted that role.
[02:42:35.080 --> 02:42:40.080]  So what are some of the things that motivate you today?
[02:42:40.080 --> 02:42:42.080]  KDE asked.
[02:42:42.080 --> 02:42:53.080]  Well, redemption, you know, to redeem myself, to show young people that no matter where you are today that you can always improve yourself.
[02:42:53.080 --> 02:42:57.080]  And become a better person.
[02:42:57.080 --> 02:42:59.080]  How do you pronounce that caller's name?
[02:42:59.080 --> 02:43:02.080]  Vladislav Vladislav.
[02:43:02.080 --> 02:43:05.080]  They were going to Vladislav here in just a moment.
[02:43:05.080 --> 02:43:08.080]  Let's go to Vladislav now in Washington.
[02:43:08.080 --> 02:43:12.080]  You're on the air with the real Rick Ross.
[02:43:12.080 --> 02:43:13.080]  Hello, Rick.
[02:43:13.080 --> 02:43:15.080]  My name is Vladislav here in Battleground, Washington.
[02:43:15.080 --> 02:43:24.080]  My question is very basic to you, basically what motivated you to deal with drugs with the CIA and afterwards what changed your mind?
[02:43:24.080 --> 02:43:25.080]  But has anybody been listening?
[02:43:25.080 --> 02:43:35.080]  He didn't know he was dealing drugs with the CIA until it came out in court because the operative that his was a supplier from the Air Force base hadn't told him that.
[02:43:35.080 --> 02:43:40.080]  So I don't mean to answer his question for you, but I mean, what motivated you to deal drugs?
[02:43:40.080 --> 02:43:42.080]  I think you said that money, right?
[02:43:42.080 --> 02:43:50.080]  Poverty, money. Yeah, I was tired of my mom struggling and not having food in the refrigerator.
[02:43:50.080 --> 02:43:54.080]  You know, there's been days that me and my brothers and sisters woke up and there was nothing in there to eat.
[02:43:54.080 --> 02:43:56.080]  I've got a question to ask you. Thank you, caller.
[02:43:56.080 --> 02:44:01.080]  I appreciate it. I'm trying to be mean. He just answered that.
[02:44:01.080 --> 02:44:03.080]  What does your mother think?
[02:44:03.080 --> 02:44:06.080]  I like that scarface story.
[02:44:06.080 --> 02:44:09.080]  What does your mother think when suddenly you had all this money?
[02:44:09.080 --> 02:44:12.080]  Well, you know, my mom put me out of the house when she first found out I was dealing drugs.
[02:44:12.080 --> 02:44:17.080]  You know, my mom was a diehard Christian and, you know, first thing came to her mind.
[02:44:17.080 --> 02:44:19.080]  Oh, you're going to hell forever.
[02:44:19.080 --> 02:44:21.080]  So she threw me out the house.
[02:44:21.080 --> 02:44:27.080]  But when she did, I was already, I was already ghetto rich. I had $100,000.
[02:44:27.080 --> 02:44:32.080]  So everybody in the neighborhood wanted me to come to their house and stay.
[02:44:32.080 --> 02:44:35.080]  But eventually she started to succumb to the money.
[02:44:35.080 --> 02:44:41.080]  You know, I bought pool pits for the church and air conditioners and, you know,
[02:44:41.080 --> 02:44:45.080]  I remodeled her house where she didn't have holes in the floors and had exterminated, you know,
[02:44:45.080 --> 02:44:52.080]  put the tent over to get rid of the rats and the roaches and I was still her son.
[02:44:52.080 --> 02:44:57.080]  So no matter what happened, you know, she still loved me and adored me.
[02:44:57.080 --> 02:44:59.080]  So our relationship never changed.
[02:44:59.080 --> 02:45:03.080]  Last grab. There's nothing more powerful than the flesh, flesh of my flesh.
[02:45:03.080 --> 02:45:07.080]  Let's go to Julio in Wyoming. Julio, welcome the airwaves with Rick Ross.
[02:45:07.080 --> 02:45:08.080]  What up, Julio?
[02:45:08.080 --> 02:45:10.080]  Hey, what's going on, Rick Ross?
[02:45:10.080 --> 02:45:15.080]  I first learned about you in college when I was a sophomore, when I first heard about Alex Jones.
[02:45:15.080 --> 02:45:20.080]  And I want to say, God bless you for what you're doing and speaking out against the drug culture.
[02:45:20.080 --> 02:45:26.080]  Studying media in college, it's clear we have this predictive program society.
[02:45:26.080 --> 02:45:29.080]  A quick story I want to share, just living in Wyoming for a couple months.
[02:45:29.080 --> 02:45:35.080]  I've interacted with someone who I work with at my radio station, his brother-in-law.
[02:45:35.080 --> 02:45:40.080]  He works for a pharmaceutical company and he legally, I used air quotes on that,
[02:45:40.080 --> 02:45:47.080]  legally purchases methamphetamines and cocaine for the big drug manufacturers.
[02:45:47.080 --> 02:45:51.080]  And they go all over the country to pick up legal purchases.
[02:45:51.080 --> 02:45:56.080]  But I completely agree with what you and Alex are talking about with predictive programming.
[02:45:56.080 --> 02:46:01.080]  There's a movie they came out with a couple of years ago, Two Guns, with Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg.
[02:46:01.080 --> 02:46:05.080]  And again, they kind of just threw it in our face.
[02:46:05.080 --> 02:46:09.080]  They just did met the CIS bringing the drugs in. It's all just f-flapping it in our face.
[02:46:09.080 --> 02:46:13.080]  Hey, with the Army, the Air Force, they're all doing this.
[02:46:13.080 --> 02:46:22.080]  My question to you, Rick Ross, is, hey, what's one of the biggest keys for us to talk to the youth about drugs?
[02:46:22.080 --> 02:46:27.200]  drugs. Here in Wyoming, the Native American culture, they're in a huge rat hole because
[02:46:27.200 --> 02:46:32.240]  of methamphetamine use. And the Bureau of Indian Affairs, which is basically the FBI
[02:46:32.240 --> 02:46:38.640]  for Native Americans, they're the ones who are helping push methamphetamine use here.
[02:46:38.640 --> 02:46:45.840]  So how do we talk to the people? How do we even engage the police officers? Schaumburg,
[02:46:45.840 --> 02:46:51.520]  Illinois, a big suburb of Chicago, recently they've been caught stealing drugs themselves
[02:46:51.520 --> 02:46:55.760]  and stealing it from drug dealers and pushing it on the culture. Well, that's it. And look,
[02:46:55.760 --> 02:47:00.720]  they have to stop. They got rid of alcohol prohibition. Now they brought in this new
[02:47:00.720 --> 02:47:04.560]  prohibition. And now they want to grab our kids. And it's just there's never enough.
[02:47:04.560 --> 02:47:09.200]  And they laugh on TV and past Obamacare. That's a giant screw job. I mean, this thing is out of
[02:47:09.200 --> 02:47:14.240]  control. They're killing the golden goose. Rick Ross, how do we stop drug war? I think what you're
[02:47:14.240 --> 02:47:18.560]  doing right now, Alex, is a start. This is how you got to get started. Because, you know, you're
[02:47:18.560 --> 02:47:23.360]  talking about fighting the thousand pound gorilla, and you're not going to whoop him, you know,
[02:47:23.360 --> 02:47:27.360]  just going to head up with him. And you got you got to sit down and think and talk like Alex is
[02:47:27.360 --> 02:47:31.200]  doing right now. And, you know, most people don't even want to talk about these issues. You know,
[02:47:31.200 --> 02:47:35.120]  most of you got to exactly got to force it out there till everybody knows. And it's starting to
[02:47:35.120 --> 02:47:41.600]  happen. Yeah. And once you start to do that, then you can start attacking it. Because when people
[02:47:41.600 --> 02:47:46.560]  are dumb and you remember how I was, I was dumb and literate. You know, I never read a book,
[02:47:46.560 --> 02:47:51.920]  you know, never heard Alex Jones or nothing. I didn't know anything. So anything that somebody
[02:47:51.920 --> 02:47:55.680]  brought to me, I went for it. You know, they bring it to you. Oh, this is for you. It's good
[02:47:55.680 --> 02:48:00.080]  for you taking and using this how you do it. And then you find yourself caught up in stuff that
[02:48:01.200 --> 02:48:05.360]  you never thought you could have been. My dad and mom were big into history. And so my dad would
[02:48:05.360 --> 02:48:08.960]  tell me when I was young, no, the government brings in the drugs. Here's the biggest presence.
[02:48:08.960 --> 02:48:15.520]  He's booked where he admits it. And when you're old enough, read it. And I mean, and I just thought
[02:48:15.520 --> 02:48:18.480]  everybody knew this stuff. And then there were the police dealing drugs, just like my dad said.
[02:48:19.120 --> 02:48:22.720]  And then I've had Serpa Cohen. What do you think about his story? You know, they just
[02:48:22.720 --> 02:48:27.200]  police shot him in the face. Yeah, I mean, because he didn't want to deal drugs.
[02:48:28.640 --> 02:48:33.360]  I mean, he said the entire New York narcotics department, then we're all dealing drugs.
[02:48:33.360 --> 02:48:39.600]  Wow. I said, how what percentage? He said 100%. Wow. Everyone he knew. And then he was even
[02:48:39.600 --> 02:48:42.560]  letting them deal the drugs. He just said, I want and they still tried to kill him.
[02:48:44.400 --> 02:48:49.680]  Crazy. Absolutely crazy. Yeah, it's crazy. Thank you, Julio. Let's go to another caller here.
[02:48:49.680 --> 02:48:52.160]  Jacob in Missouri, go ahead. You're on the air with Rick Ross.
[02:48:53.040 --> 02:48:57.280]  Yeah, how you guys doing? I just got a quick question for each one of you. You can just
[02:48:57.280 --> 02:49:02.080]  bear with me real quick. Just I don't use this word at all. But this is an epic, epic interview of
[02:49:02.080 --> 02:49:07.920]  this, you know, just like workout interview right here. But real quick, Mr. Ross,
[02:49:10.400 --> 02:49:16.720]  I literally did a fist bump when I heard you say that you're getting ready to do something with
[02:49:16.720 --> 02:49:24.160]  Professor Griff. I have four brothers, a couple of us, you know, we're so much alike. We don't
[02:49:24.160 --> 02:49:29.200]  get along. A couple of us, we, you know, we don't see eye on everything, but we look and act just
[02:49:29.200 --> 02:49:34.880]  we have to drop our differences. I mean, what comes next is my question to you. And then I
[02:49:34.880 --> 02:49:43.120]  have a question for Alex, too. What's next? Can you just get with people like a moral technique,
[02:49:43.120 --> 02:49:48.000]  KRS one, and just combine like everybody needs to organize and get together?
[02:49:49.040 --> 02:49:52.800]  I agree with Professor Griff's want to work with me, but I've gotten too busy. We need to get in
[02:49:52.800 --> 02:49:57.840]  the system space and because they want to control music and say, we know you're doing it. Here's
[02:49:57.840 --> 02:50:02.800]  the master plan. Here's how you laid it out. And people don't put up with these gangbangers anymore.
[02:50:02.800 --> 02:50:06.960]  They're nothing but soldiers of the new world order to destroy our communities. People need to
[02:50:06.960 --> 02:50:10.880]  laugh at these gangbangers, not make them heroes. That's my point. Sorry. Yeah, I agree with you.
[02:50:10.880 --> 02:50:15.040]  That we definitely got to do that. Hit them right in the face. And like I said before,
[02:50:15.040 --> 02:50:18.480]  what Alex is doing right now, you know, most people won't even talk to me. They don't want to
[02:50:18.480 --> 02:50:22.640]  sit down and debate with me what happened in my life and what I went through. What they want to
[02:50:22.640 --> 02:50:27.920]  do is just say, oh, you're no good. Two bit drug dealer. You should have stayed in prison for the
[02:50:27.920 --> 02:50:31.680]  rest of your life. You know, you shouldn't even be out of prison. They don't want to look at the
[02:50:31.680 --> 02:50:37.200]  facts. You know, why didn't learn how to read? I was 28 years old. Why was the school pushing me
[02:50:37.200 --> 02:50:42.160]  through? And these are the issues that need to be dealt with. You know, why are there 600,000
[02:50:43.280 --> 02:50:48.880]  black men, just black men in widest country has 2.2 million people in prison right now. And I think
[02:50:48.880 --> 02:50:54.400]  like 50 something million on paper. Some believable ladies and gentlemen, final segment, we may do
[02:50:54.400 --> 02:51:01.520]  some overdrive with the real Rick Ross. I'm Alex Jones. This hour of GCN programming is proudly

[02:52:58.800 --> 02:53:02.880]  Thanksgiving this year, I was thinking, what am I really thankful for? And I got to tell you,
[02:53:02.880 --> 02:53:07.200]  it's my family. It's all the blessings of liberty that our forebears secured. And it's you, the
[02:53:07.200 --> 02:53:12.800]  listeners of the broadcast, who've made everything we do possible. This Black Friday, I decided to
[02:53:12.800 --> 02:53:18.880]  bring you the biggest special we've ever offered on any of the nutraceuticals at infowarslife.com.
[02:53:18.880 --> 02:53:23.280]  I'm talking about silver bullet colloidal silver that we've been sold out of for months. This time
[02:53:23.280 --> 02:53:27.920]  I doubled down and got even more. As of me taping this on the eve of Thanksgiving, we have already
[02:53:27.920 --> 02:53:32.000]  sold half of it. So instead of keeping the price at its regular discounted price, we are going to
[02:53:32.000 --> 02:53:37.360]  give you 20% off and free shipping on single bottles. But if you get four bottles, we're going to
[02:53:37.360 --> 02:53:40.960]  give you the fifth one free and the free shipping. I don't know how long this special will run, but
[02:53:40.960 --> 02:53:46.000]  if supplies last, we will extend it out until Cyber Monday. You'll find powerful nutraceuticals
[02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:52.240]  like silver bullet and others at infowarslife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139. Again,
[02:53:52.240 --> 02:53:56.800]  this is Alex Jones wishing you all a blessed and happy Thanksgiving and thanking you all for your
[02:53:56.800 --> 02:54:08.400]  support of freedom. We're back folks. We're going to do a little bit of overdrive so we can get to
[02:54:08.400 --> 02:54:15.280]  more of your phone calls. Stephen James, Mike, Mark, and others. But before we go any further,
[02:54:15.280 --> 02:54:23.040]  some really good Twitter questions are coming in. Yeah, that's right. I forgot that had a
[02:54:23.040 --> 02:54:31.520]  liner. It is Alex Jones. Thanks for joining us. So many good questions here. Here's a question
[02:54:32.080 --> 02:54:37.600]  that I want to get to. Have you ever reached out to big artists about de-glorifying drug dealing,
[02:54:37.600 --> 02:54:43.920]  IEJZ, etc. And if so, what was their reaction? Well, I tried to reach out to everybody in
[02:54:43.920 --> 02:54:49.760]  hip hop about us coming together and changing this culture and so forth. Nobody would touch me.
[02:54:49.760 --> 02:54:56.640]  They'd have a meeting with Dr. Dre and brought up the subject and I was cut off.
[02:54:58.800 --> 02:55:07.600]  Really? Yeah. So right now I'm out on my own. So the man, people know, you talk about this,
[02:55:07.600 --> 02:55:11.760]  you push this poison culture, or the big boys aren't going to put you on the radio.
[02:55:11.760 --> 02:55:15.280]  Oh, absolutely not. They're not going to touch you. You start doing the things that I'm doing.
[02:55:15.280 --> 02:55:21.360]  You know, I have to sell my t-shirts and I bought you one of my shirts too. Thank you, sir. I have
[02:55:21.360 --> 02:55:26.000]  to sell my t-shirts in my books to pay my way around the country. Good looking shirt. Let me
[02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:29.520]  ask you a question. How do folks book you to come speak to their college, their church, or their
[02:55:29.520 --> 02:55:35.920]  high school? They can get me on Instagram, Twitter, or my website. RickRossBooks.com,
[02:55:36.560 --> 02:55:42.080]  Freeway Rick website, and they can book me there. I'm going to wear this shirt. I hope it's an
[02:55:42.080 --> 02:55:47.040]  extra large. It is. It's an extra large. I told you I was big. Okay. The real Rick Ross is not a
[02:55:47.040 --> 02:55:52.240]  rapper. I tell you, I'm going to wear this shirt. And it's a nice shirt too. You feel the quality?
[02:55:52.240 --> 02:55:56.960]  I love that fabric. Yeah, I use, I use some nice cotton because I know we like nice things. So,
[02:55:56.960 --> 02:56:02.080]  so I hooked it up and I think it's important that we send a message to all these guys,
[02:56:02.080 --> 02:56:06.880]  you know, everybody who's promoting this drug culture. I like the fact that Mark Dice,
[02:56:06.880 --> 02:56:11.520]  one of our contributors, he really goes after Rick Ross. I love Mark. I love Mark. He's awesome.
[02:56:11.520 --> 02:56:15.280]  You know who he is. Good, good. Yeah, I know who Mark is. Mark is wonderful. You know, he hits me
[02:56:15.280 --> 02:56:20.160]  up on Twitter and Instagram and we talk about the whole 09 yards and he went in on the rapper
[02:56:20.160 --> 02:56:25.280]  for what he did, you know, and what he's doing. And I think more people should, you know, we should
[02:56:25.280 --> 02:56:31.120]  not only, and not only go. He stole your identity to sell kids on going to prison. That's gotta make
[02:56:31.120 --> 02:56:35.840]  you mad. Yeah, it should. Should make everybody mad and not only mad at him, but mad at the radio
[02:56:35.840 --> 02:56:43.440]  stations, mad at the universal and one of brothers. I don't think, I don't think adults know what's on,
[02:56:43.440 --> 02:56:47.440]  what's in this music. Let me ask you another question here.
[02:56:49.920 --> 02:56:56.400]  I know it's a lofty task says Brandon Bula, but will we ever see Gary Webb's third book?
[02:56:56.400 --> 02:57:00.160]  Because the person says second, but would have been his third book put out by M4 Wars,
[02:57:00.160 --> 02:57:04.080]  The Real Rick Ross. Yeah, I tried to reach out to the family, but they were so scared they never
[02:57:04.080 --> 02:57:09.760]  talked to me after they killed him. Whatever happened to that book? I don't know. I mean,
[02:57:09.760 --> 02:57:15.280]  you know, I was still in prison when all that happened. So maybe you're the guy to reach out
[02:57:15.280 --> 02:57:18.560]  to the family. Have you talked to him since the movie premiere? I spoke to, no, not since
[02:57:18.560 --> 02:57:23.600]  then. I spoke to the wife at Edelink, you know, we talked for about 15 minutes. Because the first
[02:57:23.600 --> 02:57:28.800]  time that we had time to sit and talk outside of prison, when I was in prison, I spoke on the phone.
[02:57:28.800 --> 02:57:34.480]  So maybe I should. I got a phone number now. So maybe I'll reach out to an actor if we can get
[02:57:34.480 --> 02:57:39.360]  those notes. Well, he had a whole book written and he sent me a desk, but it got lost and
[02:57:39.360 --> 02:57:45.200]  everything. Would you do any help? Do that? Listen, last time I talked to Gary,
[02:57:46.960 --> 02:57:49.760]  I was busy. I said, I mean, everybody knows the government deals drugs. I've had you on the
[02:57:49.760 --> 02:57:53.520]  show. I want to get you on again. He's like, no, not to my books out. And he called back a month
[02:57:53.520 --> 02:57:56.640]  later. He goes, listen, I gave you all those documents, put them up on the site. You know,
[02:57:56.640 --> 02:58:00.640]  I need somebody to put this stuff on an internet site. And I was like, okay, but,
[02:58:01.840 --> 02:58:05.120]  and then he was like, he didn't really cuss love. He's like, damn it, when you're ready to do
[02:58:05.120 --> 02:58:09.280]  something about this, you give me a call, bang. I'm sure somebody probably got those notes now.
[02:58:09.280 --> 02:58:13.120]  And I'd be surprised if his wife still had that stuff. But he was passionate. I mean,
[02:58:13.120 --> 02:58:16.720]  he was telling me you need to, you need to get out without a doubt. I mean, Gary was,
[02:58:16.720 --> 02:58:20.640]  he was willing to, I mean, Gary told me before that people have died for going down this road.
[02:58:20.640 --> 02:58:24.240]  You know, I mean, he's like, Hey, Rick, when you go down this street here, you know, like,
[02:58:24.240 --> 02:58:29.440]  I know going down the drug street selling drugs, you could get killed. Well, Gary told me that
[02:58:29.440 --> 02:58:33.920]  there's been people that went down the same road that he was going down. They're gotten killed.
[02:58:33.920 --> 02:58:37.760]  He told me that people like Gary Webber, true modern day heroes and
