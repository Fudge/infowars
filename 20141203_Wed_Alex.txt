[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.760]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.760 --> 00:33.840]  Phil Schlafly founder of the Eagle Forum has been on the cutting edge of warning
[00:33.840 --> 00:37.800]  of the globalist plan to implode our borders and open up our sovereignty to
[00:37.800 --> 00:41.240]  the rest of the world particularly Latin America will be joining us again in
[00:41.240 --> 00:46.240]  the second hour today I say again because she was on a month ago or so we
[00:46.240 --> 00:50.640]  said we would have her back on the eve of Obama's promised executive
[00:50.640 --> 00:56.480]  action that the Republicans are already caving on that's what senator
[00:56.480 --> 01:01.320]  Sessions is saying and that is what Boehner is announcing oh we don't want
[01:01.320 --> 01:04.880]  to government shut down we promised that member when they had their quote
[01:04.880 --> 01:10.160]  landslide a few weeks ago the biggest political realignment in over a hundred
[01:10.160 --> 01:14.400]  years in this country they said two things Boehner and McConnell sent the
[01:14.400 --> 01:19.720]  signal that night and then that morning that Tuesday night and that Wednesday
[01:19.720 --> 01:29.560]  morning they both said that we're not gonna repeal Obamacare and that we can't
[01:29.560 --> 01:35.680]  repeal Obamacare to take wind out of the sails and they went on to say and
[01:35.680 --> 01:39.640]  we're not gonna shut the government down over immigration reform which is
[01:39.640 --> 01:42.920]  really just the end of the country merging us into the North American Union
[01:42.920 --> 01:49.440]  constitutional crisis should be the headline across the country the end of
[01:49.440 --> 01:55.000]  the United States the birth of the North American Third World Union those
[01:55.000 --> 02:03.120]  aren't talking points that's reality only in the mainline libertarian
[02:03.120 --> 02:10.240]  conservative movement crowd hammer Paul a handful of others are saying this is
[02:10.240 --> 02:18.160]  treasonous this is illegal impeach cutoff funding senator Sessions is saying
[02:18.160 --> 02:22.880]  the same thing Walter Jones is saying it but I mean that is a handful this is
[02:22.880 --> 02:30.120]  outrageous and it's being done and Mexico and Guatemala are thanking Obama
[02:30.120 --> 02:34.680]  who arrogantly last week said hey don't heckle me protesters you know for
[02:34.680 --> 02:38.560]  Mexico that want I mean there's never gonna be enough I already changed the
[02:38.560 --> 02:49.620]  law see before even did an executive order Obama said I changed the law back
[02:49.620 --> 02:53.840]  in January the border patrol told us and it even took info wars five months to
[02:53.840 --> 02:59.960]  get up off our big fat butts I'm talking about me we have our eyes and in
[02:59.960 --> 03:03.280]  border patrol contacts they go listen come down to this area we're ordered
[03:03.280 --> 03:06.520]  just let them in that's all we can tell you just come down to McCallan come down
[03:06.520 --> 03:10.600]  to Brownsville come down these points and you're gonna see something because
[03:10.600 --> 03:14.280]  they can't even tell you or they're gonna violate their quote orders they
[03:14.280 --> 03:18.120]  can just say might want to come look here well we finally went down there and
[03:18.120 --> 03:22.400]  there were the buses coming across every hour being loaded onto US buses with
[03:22.400 --> 03:27.240]  the border patrol fencing the money through the local emergency managers who
[03:27.240 --> 03:31.640]  we interviewed to give them the federal vouchers to go anywhere they want men
[03:31.640 --> 03:37.280]  women children you name it but to take them to Baptist Catholic you name it
[03:37.280 --> 03:44.440]  churches is staging grounds for three hots in a cot I mean this is a planned
[03:44.440 --> 03:49.240]  program as one senior board patrol agent said we can't tell you what the
[03:49.240 --> 03:53.480]  orders are because we've been ordered not to but the border patrol now completes
[03:53.480 --> 03:58.720]  the smuggling process do you understand this is the full-on conquering
[03:58.720 --> 04:04.800]  takedown of the Republic and Obama wouldn't be pulling something this
[04:04.800 --> 04:12.840]  ultra bold ultra bold if he didn't have backing by the big banks and by the
[04:12.840 --> 04:18.240]  Chamber of Commerce and by the Republican blue blood leadership and now
[04:18.240 --> 04:22.280]  you're seeing it right in your face and by the way when they're done opening the
[04:22.280 --> 04:26.800]  border up and they think they've got a veto vote on the American people they're
[04:26.800 --> 04:30.000]  going to start the bail ins and start taking money out of your bank accounts
[04:30.000 --> 04:34.600]  they're going to federalize your pension funds and take part of it one piece of

[08:08.120 --> 08:12.840]  Attorney General Holder to identify additional actions my administration
[08:12.840 --> 08:18.280]  can take on our own within my existing legal authorities to do what Congress
[08:18.280 --> 08:22.840]  refuses to do and fix as much of our immigration system as we can. From the
[08:22.840 --> 08:31.840]  front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones. That's right your globalist
[08:31.840 --> 08:36.880]  you like to conquer countries through financial fraud but you can't get the
[08:36.880 --> 08:41.680]  House and Senate in the States to do exactly what you want well just change
[08:41.680 --> 08:48.560]  the law by executive fiat and claim that it's within your authority but then
[08:48.560 --> 08:51.800]  when legal scholars across the board point out it's illegal say well I
[08:51.800 --> 08:57.520]  didn't really mean I changed the law when I said that just like he didn't mean
[08:57.520 --> 09:01.440]  it when he said if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor first he said
[09:01.440 --> 09:05.920]  I never said that and then they found over a hundred instances of him saying
[09:05.920 --> 09:11.880]  it in speeches so he meant well I didn't mean you could keep your doctor but
[09:11.880 --> 09:20.280]  first he said I never said that then he said oh well I didn't mean that by the
[09:20.280 --> 09:24.040]  way Hillary Clinton went to give a speech and the hall was half empty and
[09:24.040 --> 09:27.640]  she's still the frontrunner of the Democrats and is set to announce very
[09:27.640 --> 09:30.640]  soon there's reports out on that today and people say well there's no way she'll
[09:30.640 --> 09:37.120]  get elected she's incredibly unpopular well they run the Democratic Party
[09:37.120 --> 09:44.200]  Mafia and they're tied into the blue blood Republican neocon Bush Mafia and
[09:44.760 --> 09:50.720]  so expect her to be in the running and even though the public is leaning
[09:50.720 --> 09:55.400]  towards electing a Republican it won't matter if it's a Chris Christie open
[09:55.400 --> 10:01.400]  borders anti-gun type person in fact Hillary might even be better because at
[10:01.400 --> 10:06.200]  least she's universally reviled in libertarian and conservative circles so
[10:06.200 --> 10:11.600]  it wouldn't take long to organize a defense against her that's why I don't
[10:11.600 --> 10:16.440]  think they're gonna put Hillary in in 2016 they're going to put forward a
[10:16.440 --> 10:22.200]  neocon rhino piece of garbage and we're seeing those traders in action right
[10:22.200 --> 10:30.320]  now the magnitude of what's happening should not be lost on anyone
[10:30.880 --> 10:39.440]  Obama through executive secret actions in January ordered the border patrol to
[10:39.440 --> 10:43.480]  basically let anybody and everybody in and to give them vouchers to busts
[10:43.480 --> 10:48.960]  illegals in a Democratic Party held areas to be kept at government buildings
[10:48.960 --> 10:56.800]  public school facilities and churches and then to be distributed upwards of
[10:56.800 --> 11:02.640]  $2,000 plus dollars a month per illegal that Democratic Party operatives house
[11:02.640 --> 11:07.280]  in their homes in groups of three between six and eight thousand dollars
[11:07.280 --> 11:13.120]  cash billions being spent a month what's your job of your Democrat you house
[11:13.120 --> 11:16.880]  three illegals you help them get a house the banks help them they become an
[11:16.880 --> 11:21.880]  anchor point then they bring in the next wave and they're cult-like followers of
[11:21.880 --> 11:27.160]  the Democratic Party pretty close to game over and game over means the big
[11:27.160 --> 11:31.040]  mega banks Google and others that lobby to take your guns that lobby to raise
[11:31.040 --> 11:35.600]  your taxes and that lobby to pay zero tax they're gonna break us and break us
[11:35.600 --> 11:42.560]  hard and that's what Homeland Security's for make no mistake so you want to get
[11:42.560 --> 11:48.240]  broken get ready this is the conquering of what's left of the American
[11:48.240 --> 11:54.520]  Republic and I'm getting chills this whole morning as it really comes home
[11:54.520 --> 11:59.800]  that it's really happening and I had some pathetic inkling some pathetic
[11:59.800 --> 12:06.160]  wisp of a hope of a dream that the Tea Party Revolution would have scared the
[12:06.160 --> 12:17.240]  blue bloods Bainer and others into doing the right thing and at least putting a
[12:17.240 --> 12:22.120]  tourniquet on the country's leg that's chopped off and mangled instead they're
[12:22.120 --> 12:25.400]  going over with a hacksaw to cut the other one off and untie the tourniquet
[12:25.400 --> 12:30.840]  to put us into a giant third world North American Union where we have absolutely
[12:30.840 --> 12:34.160]  no rights in the North American Union documents that we've read on air that I
[12:34.160 --> 12:40.120]  cover in my film in game they state that they will use open borders to bring in
[12:40.120 --> 12:46.120]  the North American Union and to defeat any political opposition to the one
[12:46.120 --> 12:51.480]  world government global governance agenda and a lot of yuppies and hippies
[12:51.480 --> 12:55.480]  and people that just comply with everything don't understand that the
[12:55.480 --> 13:05.200]  season of fattening us up is about to be over the season of all the fiat money
[13:05.200 --> 13:10.720]  and the rest of it is about to be over that was anesthesia while they basically
[13:10.720 --> 13:15.120]  chopped us up but now our arms and legs are gone they're about to take the
[13:15.120 --> 13:23.600]  anesthesia off and finish us you understand that folks this is so real
[13:23.600 --> 13:30.240]  this is so planned this is so totalitarian it's wicked and they
[13:30.240 --> 13:36.880]  spin it by calling it immigration reform and as I've said you can throw your
[13:36.880 --> 13:43.640]  dog if you want into a wood chipper and call it reform but it's really chopping
[13:43.640 --> 13:48.960]  it up in little pieces you could go jump in a big wood chipper and tell her
[13:48.960 --> 13:53.840]  body hey I'm about to reform myself as if that's a good word this is the mind
[13:53.840 --> 13:59.280]  games they play the discrimination of giving illegals in state tuition giving
[13:59.280 --> 14:03.520]  them free babies to be born anchor babies giving them free basically
[14:03.520 --> 14:08.840]  everything when citizens don't get that on average and when people that try to
[14:08.840 --> 14:11.960]  come here legally and lawfully have to jump through a bunch of hoops it's
[14:11.960 --> 14:18.400]  despicable and then to make it a racial issue if you don't accept whatever the
[14:18.400 --> 14:22.880]  system says but the public rebels against that even a majority of Hispanics in
[14:22.880 --> 14:26.760]  major polls that are US citizens don't want open borders they're not stupid
[14:26.760 --> 14:31.000]  folks that came here from the third world don't want us to be third world
[14:31.000 --> 14:39.040]  that's why they left it but now they are hand-picking out of Central America
[14:39.040 --> 14:43.000]  because Mexico tends to be more libertarian and we're more conservative
[14:43.000 --> 14:50.600]  in the voting patterns Guatemala Nicaragua and El Salvador baby they
[14:50.600 --> 14:56.800]  wear red caps and they give the communist salute shea guavara does it
[14:56.800 --> 15:00.720]  matter if shea guavara called natives every racist name in the book do you
[15:00.720 --> 15:05.520]  know how racist Latin America is it with the white-skinned ruling class that
[15:05.520 --> 15:11.160]  looks like Vicente Fox looks like shea guavara you know what happens in
[15:11.160 --> 15:16.880]  Mexico if you look like shea guavara the women just run at you just boom that's
[15:16.880 --> 15:22.760]  who they want to breed with total racism ladies and gentlemen shea guavara
[15:22.760 --> 15:27.680]  wrote books calling Mexicans everybody else cockroaches and things but they
[15:27.680 --> 15:32.640]  love him see how that works ladies and gentlemen see I happen to be informed I
[15:32.640 --> 15:37.120]  happen to know how this works I happen to know the real dynamics of the
[15:37.120 --> 15:42.800]  anthropology the sociology the economics of these areas I've been there I've
[15:42.800 --> 15:45.720]  studied it I know
[15:50.120 --> 15:58.080]  and then they sit here using the Christian abolitionist idea mutating it
[15:58.080 --> 16:04.760]  into a Democratic Party white guilt to make that the only issue to tie their
[16:04.760 --> 16:13.040]  gun control to to tie their open borders to to tie their executive action to to
[16:13.040 --> 16:19.400]  create division in the nation so that the general public guilty whites and
[16:19.400 --> 16:26.840]  minorities bleeding heart self-hating whites will do whatever they're told
[16:26.840 --> 16:30.160]  so that the magic wand of political correctness can be waved above their
[16:30.160 --> 16:34.880]  head and be told you are correct you are part of the good group you are
[16:34.880 --> 16:40.800]  absolved of your sin my son that's what all this diversity training and the
[16:40.800 --> 16:46.400]  rest of it is is going confess your classism confess your racism confess
[16:46.400 --> 16:53.600]  your bad it's a giant reeducation camp every day articles come across my desk
[16:53.600 --> 16:57.560]  in elementary schools where they're teaching them that white people are
[16:57.560 --> 17:01.600]  inherently bad and evil and you know portrayed on the rest of it and the
[17:01.600 --> 17:06.120]  point is is this is all done so that you're not educated on reading writing
[17:06.120 --> 17:10.880]  and arithmetic or how to do business or how to grow a garden or how to be polite
[17:10.880 --> 17:15.800]  or how to have good hygiene how to be successful how to get an apprenticeship
[17:15.800 --> 17:21.960]  how to how to learn to be successful and self-sufficient it's to give the
[17:21.960 --> 17:29.040]  children total mental illness complexes about what color they are when the truth
[17:29.040 --> 17:33.040]  is it doesn't matter what color you are if you've got good values and work hard
[17:33.040 --> 17:38.520]  and have ideas you will be successful because companies and businesses and
[17:38.520 --> 17:44.880]  institutions and societies want to be around trustworthy people it's hard to
[17:44.880 --> 17:49.600]  find them all these idiots not just minorities it's white people it's
[17:49.600 --> 17:54.720]  everybody the dishonorableness out there people thinking being liars is good
[17:54.720 --> 17:59.320]  thinking cheating is good thinking manipulating is winning well in a
[17:59.320 --> 18:04.960]  society of scum there is no honor but in the real society that's still left in
[18:04.960 --> 18:09.800]  this country and it's in middle-class neighborhoods and working-class

[24:18.280 --> 24:23.880]  end national sovereignty by creating a Tower of Babel or Babel hence the word
[24:23.880 --> 24:28.120]  babbling where you don't understand someone from the story of the Tower of
[24:28.120 --> 24:31.760]  Babel where a whole bunch of cultures got together and couldn't communicate
[24:31.760 --> 24:35.720]  and everything broke down and infighting that's the globalist plan so
[24:35.720 --> 24:40.840]  there's no nation or no group or no ideology that stands against them it's
[24:40.840 --> 24:47.040]  just a creeping global corporate structure to conquer the planet just like
[24:47.040 --> 24:51.120]  the speech in network where explains there are no countries there are no
[24:51.120 --> 25:00.080]  peoples there's only stock well the problem is we are a commodity in this
[25:00.080 --> 25:03.960]  and a commodity of very low value in fact negative value in many of the
[25:03.960 --> 25:08.120]  globalist actuaries and they want to bring in a planetary government to
[25:08.120 --> 25:12.800]  dominate and control us many opportunists say well I'll just work with the system I
[25:12.800 --> 25:18.680]  know it's corrupt but what are you going to do do you understand it's a system
[25:18.680 --> 25:25.840]  meant to dumb us down shackle us control us and then forcibly inoculate us
[25:25.840 --> 25:32.120]  soft kill us that's a fact and I will not just sit here and play along with
[25:32.120 --> 25:39.520]  the system and join it and hope that I'm in the 10% they allow to live or my
[25:39.520 --> 25:44.880]  children are whenever they decide to drop the hammer and lease the bio weapons
[25:44.880 --> 25:50.760]  the hard kill weapons not the creeping death soft kill and by the way ladies and
[25:50.760 --> 25:57.680]  gentlemen fighting these people 20 years I had been on air a year and a half
[25:57.680 --> 26:03.440]  when the Democratic Party contacted me high-level people in Texas and said you
[26:03.440 --> 26:07.800]  better get on board with us we're gonna come after you that's why they're
[26:07.800 --> 26:11.920]  successful they're watching talent they're watching up-and-comers because
[26:11.920 --> 26:17.040]  they know just like scouts go and watch people play baseball so they can you
[26:17.040 --> 26:20.520]  know recruit them out of college or football it's the same deal and they
[26:20.520 --> 26:26.320]  got very threatening when I wouldn't play ball with them
[26:29.320 --> 26:35.480]  and then I got offers for syndication all sorts of offers all sorts of deals
[26:35.480 --> 26:38.760]  but it was always the same speech join with it
[26:38.760 --> 26:42.200]  globalism is good yeah it's a world government but it wants to help people
[26:42.200 --> 26:51.280]  and redistribute this was from conservatives supposedly do you want
[26:51.280 --> 26:54.480]  to be on this crusade that's going nowhere or do you want to be a star I
[26:54.480 --> 27:01.480]  was told that by at least six different people the same line I'm not
[27:01.480 --> 27:08.840]  shining on to a plan where they put cancer viruses in basically everybody's
[27:08.840 --> 27:12.680]  vaccines except the elite that know about it I'm here warning everybody and
[27:12.680 --> 27:18.040]  you ignore my warnings at your peril folks because I'm telling you the truth
[27:18.040 --> 27:24.000]  the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help me God now does that mean
[27:24.000 --> 27:29.000]  I get things wrong does it mean I make mistakes yes but in general focus in
[27:29.000 --> 27:34.680]  terms I'm dead on and I know what I'm saying scary but it'd be a lot scarier
[27:34.680 --> 27:39.360]  not knowing it aren't you glad you know it I mean listen to Obama saying hey I
[27:39.360 --> 27:43.480]  changed the law leave me alone to the hecklers but that they're there to make
[27:43.480 --> 27:49.120]  it look like Obama hadn't really done anything to give him left cover but he's
[27:49.120 --> 27:53.040]  sick of the hecklers so he tells him shut up I gave you what you want I don't
[27:53.040 --> 27:56.920]  even know if Obama is sophisticated enough to know these Soros groups that
[27:56.920 --> 28:01.360]  are doing this are giving him cover let's go to the clip what you're not
[28:01.360 --> 28:07.240]  paying attention to is the fact that I just took an action to change the law
[28:07.240 --> 28:18.520]  now so that's point number one and listen he admits what he's just done now he
[28:18.520 --> 28:24.400]  has his new press secretary who looks like he's 14 years old but he's trendy
[28:24.400 --> 28:28.960]  and catty and you know just just like all the other sellouts he acts the whole
[28:28.960 --> 28:34.240]  mannerism of elitism they're softest they're not real people they're not
[28:34.240 --> 28:38.680]  real men they're frauds this little softest gets up and says he didn't really
[28:38.680 --> 28:45.520]  mean it it was colloquial at one point he said I just took action to change the
[28:45.520 --> 28:52.840]  law did the president misspeak in a moment of sort of passion to try to calm
[28:52.840 --> 28:57.160]  the crowd or does he fundamentally do you fundamentally believe that he has
[28:57.160 --> 29:00.760]  taken action to change listen to him give him cover I think he was speaking
[29:00.760 --> 29:07.920]  colloquially that what he has put in place meaning that obviously well no
[29:07.920 --> 29:12.720]  meaning that the that it's the responsibility of the United States
[29:12.720 --> 29:17.960]  Congress to pass law and its responsibility of the executive branch
[29:17.960 --> 29:25.200]  to implement and enforce them that's enough get him off throw up look at
[29:25.200 --> 29:29.200]  that guy talk about a traitor talk about somebody that needs to be brought to
[29:29.200 --> 29:36.640]  justice every stink in one of those cowards is anathema to everything that's
[29:36.640 --> 29:43.600]  decent and they're just so smug about it shoveling their bull you're real lucky

[33:28.840 --> 33:47.840]  this is all about North American Union everything we're seeing is the
[33:47.840 --> 33:54.120]  political takeover of the United States and for all its problems the US has
[33:54.120 --> 33:58.640]  been an example of economic and cultural freedom and has been a light to the
[33:58.640 --> 34:05.720]  world but by the 1960s really corrupt interest began to fully dominate the DC
[34:05.720 --> 34:12.640]  machine and the US Empire and and and now the US Empire is being folded into
[34:12.640 --> 34:18.280]  the European Union Empire the Asia Pacific Empire that is controlled by a
[34:18.280 --> 34:25.760]  handful well five large banks it was six Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Bank of America
[34:25.760 --> 34:32.040]  Wells Fargo a consortium of EU British banks that form into one combine the
[34:32.040 --> 34:48.480]  city of London Frankfurt Geneva Tel Aviv New York and these combines run the
[34:48.480 --> 34:55.520]  drugs launder the money run almost all organized crime use the police to enforce
[34:55.520 --> 34:59.680]  on the ground the low-level crime so big to present he's written five books that
[34:59.680 --> 35:04.400]  I've read where he openly admits all this that's why when I was a kid my dad
[35:04.400 --> 35:08.000]  would explain I just read this book by the big new presents keep the
[35:08.000 --> 35:14.760]  technotronic age in this book son and and you know he was works for the
[35:14.760 --> 35:21.320]  president Jimmy Carter this is when I'm like five years old and admits that the
[35:21.320 --> 35:25.760]  government controls organized crime and that the government's control by a
[35:25.760 --> 35:31.600]  combine of large banks I was like four years old five years old being told
[35:31.600 --> 35:38.600]  this and then a decade later I read the book that's what's so frustrating is
[35:38.600 --> 35:46.800]  they all write books saying what they're doing you read books Brazinski wrote in
[35:46.800 --> 35:53.200]  the 70s and 80s and then it all came true they're running it they plan to bring
[35:53.200 --> 35:58.280]  in a world government and to make almost everybody incredibly poor and then
[35:58.280 --> 36:08.840]  social engineer us through a 21 to tell us how to wipe our butts for real how to
[36:08.840 --> 36:13.400]  raise our children how to do everything there's never been slavery like this
[36:13.400 --> 36:20.200]  even thought up now it's manifesting and that's okay cuz blacks and whites need
[36:20.200 --> 36:30.760]  to kill each other with hammers that's okay the NFL's on tonight that's okay
[36:30.760 --> 36:34.280]  family guys coming up and listen nothing against the NFL or family guy
[36:34.280 --> 36:41.360]  ladies and gentlemen this is a reality check the president gets up there and
[36:41.360 --> 36:44.160]  says I changed the law to legalize you then his press secretary comes out and
[36:44.160 --> 36:49.440]  says he didn't really mean that well it doesn't matter that's what they're doing
[36:49.440 --> 36:55.520]  and here's the big news the Republican leadership Mitch McConnell the Senate
[36:55.520 --> 37:05.560]  John Boner Boehner are raping the Constitution Bill of Rights common
[37:05.560 --> 37:11.640]  sense due process and discriminating against American taxpayers who are
[37:11.640 --> 37:20.800]  gonna fit the bill now for tens upon tens of millions more people and now
[37:20.800 --> 37:24.960]  we're not just getting some of the hard-working people out of Mexico I mean
[37:24.960 --> 37:28.520]  there are people were in 6x underwear they had about 40 something thousand pairs
[37:28.520 --> 37:34.840]  of them they are people are showing up in buses and planes ready for dialysis
[37:34.840 --> 37:40.320]  ready for their hearts it's all meant to bankrupt the system as Ezekiel
[37:40.320 --> 37:45.080]  Emmanuel said on Fox News we're gonna bankrupt it you bet after the law passed
[37:45.080 --> 37:49.320]  you bet the plan was to bankrupt it and you bet there's death panels and you're
[37:49.320 --> 37:55.760]  not gonna get medical treatment after 75 period and Bill Gates came out and said
[37:55.760 --> 38:01.560]  yeah it's a death panel we got that law passed and the Republicans aren't gonna
[38:01.560 --> 38:07.080]  repeal a dime of it and the Republicans are gonna stand by let the
[38:07.080 --> 38:10.520]  president become a dictator because it's the office they want to be
[38:10.520 --> 38:15.240]  dictatorial so they can pass the buck into the future and have an imperial
[38:15.240 --> 38:19.560]  presidency which all declining countries end up going from representative
[38:19.560 --> 38:31.800]  government to a mob rule that then demands a Caesar, a king, a furor, a leader, I'm a
[38:31.800 --> 38:36.320]  vult, I'm a rake, I'm a furor!
[38:36.320 --> 38:48.760]  one collectivist, welfare, dumb down, fluoride head, flu shot, public
[38:48.760 --> 38:56.600]  I'm vult, one North American Union, merged lawlessly under banker control
[38:56.600 --> 39:08.400]  I'm a rake and then one leader finally over the whole world I'm furor and this
[39:08.400 --> 39:16.280]  furor is a eugenics king with all the genetic engineering and all the plagues
[39:16.280 --> 39:22.120]  of the earth poured out like revelation a poison cup is now falling
[39:22.120 --> 39:29.960]  slow motion will it hit the table in a year 10 years 20 years the truth is the
[39:29.960 --> 39:35.880]  cup already hit the table and now the bile the stinking festering evil is
[39:35.880 --> 39:42.200]  just now beginning to fly out of the cup and the first drop is hitting and your
[39:42.200 --> 39:46.360]  wars are starting all over the planet and disease is spreading all over the
[39:46.360 --> 39:50.360]  planet and families are breaking down everywhere and mental illness is just
[39:50.360 --> 39:55.560]  rampantly exploding and the public is in a trance in the West disassociating
[39:55.560 --> 39:59.960]  themselves with reality playing on their iPads and staring into diversions and
[39:59.960 --> 40:08.320]  distractions as the system sells the idea of believe whatever you want believe
[40:08.320 --> 40:12.080]  whatever reality you want you are whoever you want to be become a mentally
[40:12.080 --> 40:18.000]  ill narcissistic person join with the system just decide you're a winner by
[40:18.000 --> 40:27.120]  choosing to go along manifest whatever you want by just believing it that isn't
[40:27.120 --> 40:33.160]  how things work you have to manifest in your mind something good you want to
[40:33.160 --> 40:36.600]  build and then you had asked to be attainable and you have to go for it and
[40:36.600 --> 40:45.520]  then you have a shot at it be it good or evil I think of trying to do something
[40:45.520 --> 40:53.320]  good I'm an example of the American dream this whole media operation but it
[40:53.320 --> 40:58.720]  didn't come out of some magic cookbook it didn't come out of the secret it came
[40:58.720 --> 41:05.080]  out of study and facing reality and facing the nightmares so that I could
[41:05.080 --> 41:10.440]  save what was good for myself and my family and hopefully save it for you
[41:10.440 --> 41:17.040]  you can save it for me because we're all in this together instead we have these
[41:17.040 --> 41:24.360]  larceness wicked evil globalist who would pass Obamacare that raises taxes
[41:24.360 --> 41:31.320]  on the poorest people that cuts their hours and that destroys the future of
[41:31.320 --> 41:36.360]  their health care and gets rid of real charity care and gets rid of the the
[41:36.360 --> 41:41.760]  Hippocratic oath of Hippocrates and creates death panels that they're now
[41:41.760 --> 41:48.720]  using in the VA you think oh but it's it's the minorities against the whites
[41:48.720 --> 41:52.600]  and the police oh yeah and then people actually start forming up into those
[41:52.600 --> 42:01.400]  ranks but that is only one level of the manifestation above it outside the box
[42:01.400 --> 42:05.560]  the globalist are manipulating the whole show and the minute you pull out of that
[42:05.560 --> 42:09.080]  box you won't have my view you'll have different perspective different life
[42:09.080 --> 42:13.160]  experiences different view but it'll be a very similar thing you see to what I'm
[42:13.160 --> 42:17.040]  seeing it's like viewing the Grand Canyon from one side of the other or one
[42:17.040 --> 42:25.680]  end of the other it's still the Grand Canyon I'm not in a cave down on the
[42:25.680 --> 42:28.480]  bottom of Grand Canyon looking at cave bugs thinking that's the whole universe
[42:28.480 --> 42:32.960]  I'm outside up on the rim looking down and by the way there's not just a
[42:32.960 --> 42:38.000]  canyon there's a plane all around me and there's stars at night and a big
[42:38.000 --> 42:42.600]  raven sitting in the tree see I want you to come out of the cave come out of the
[42:42.600 --> 42:46.880]  cave it's there's a whole another universe out here and then you'll notice
[42:46.880 --> 42:54.320]  that's just another box and then above that another box and I want my progeny
[42:54.320 --> 42:59.240]  whether it be the next generation or 20 down the road to be a hundred boxes
[42:59.240 --> 43:05.720]  past me I love them I love you I love your children your children if we can
[43:05.720 --> 43:10.760]  stop the globalist are going to merge with my children look at the blessings
[43:10.760 --> 43:15.200]  of God how heavy that is and they're gonna travel space and the dimensions
[43:15.200 --> 43:19.480]  together they're going to become something we can't even imagine if we
[43:19.480 --> 43:27.360]  can stop evil wicked anti-human globalist from vandalizing this treasure
[43:27.360 --> 43:31.440]  that we live on and notice everything they do they're going to save the
[43:31.440 --> 43:34.680]  environment by taking our rights away they're the ones destroying it they're
[43:34.680 --> 43:43.240]  going to fight racism they're the ones pushing it constantly you want to end
[43:43.240 --> 43:46.920]  racism just everybody go to a barbecue together but see you can't do that
[43:46.920 --> 43:50.280]  because they've put out gangster thugism into the cultures so that
[43:50.280 --> 43:55.760]  everybody's scared it's so easy to do evil folks it's hard to do good but when
[43:55.760 --> 44:01.520]  you do good it's a million times better and then it grows on its own the truth
[44:01.520 --> 44:08.640]  doesn't have to yell and scream it's just there and the people want it and it's
[44:08.640 --> 44:16.040]  strong and it's deep and it's pure my job is to get people out of their coma so
[44:16.040 --> 44:21.080]  they can see the prima facie on its face out in the open hidden in plain view
[44:21.080 --> 44:30.320]  hiding in plain sight veritas the latin word for truth seek the truth live the
[44:30.320 --> 44:40.880]  truth love the truth and it is everything it's the knowledge of good the
[44:40.880 --> 44:47.200]  knowledge of scams and a fraud and of mental illness and delusion and of
[44:47.200 --> 44:51.680]  imagining you're something you're not and being a fraud is the knowledge of
[44:51.680 --> 44:59.080]  evil humans are fallen we know the knowledge of evil but evil seeks to
[44:59.080 --> 45:05.400]  make us not even remember that we have the knowledge of good we must rediscover
[45:05.400 --> 45:13.960]  the knowledge of good we must reach out to that knowledge and there is a place
[45:13.960 --> 45:19.840]  in us ready to be filled by it ready to animate you ready to turn you loose
[45:19.840 --> 45:25.800]  ready to make you the woman or the man you were forged in your mother's womb
[45:25.800 --> 45:35.880]  to be and in a world full of those people there's not much room for evil evil
[45:35.880 --> 45:40.560]  wants to rule and control and dominate and pull down the things that are
[45:40.560 --> 45:49.560]  beautiful because it's ugly inside and it uses our compassion and our love and
[45:49.560 --> 45:54.360]  manipulates good men and women into accepting turning our guns in so
[45:54.360 --> 45:58.360]  criminals won't kill people how ridiculous is that that good people should
[45:58.360 --> 46:05.080]  lay down their guns so the robbers won't get us or the tyrants won't get us lay
[46:05.080 --> 46:10.520]  down your arms and I'll come in and be nice just give us the gas we spare you
[46:10.520 --> 46:14.600]  our lives to quote the road warrior
[46:16.280 --> 46:20.040]  sounds like a good deal he wants to bargain with us he wants to be reasonable
[46:20.040 --> 46:25.440]  no humongous is a psychopathic killer he's gonna rape and kill you well why
[46:25.440 --> 46:30.200]  why have we given the gas why we are going out there
[46:30.200 --> 46:42.680]  humongous is bad to use that allegory that's why don't you get it so we're
[46:42.680 --> 46:49.360]  now here at the crossroads of total North American Union you notice the
[46:49.360 --> 46:52.680]  globalist are starting wars with Russia they're starting stuff with China not
[46:52.680 --> 46:55.160]  that Russia or China are good it's just the globalist are the ones moving this
[46:55.160 --> 47:01.840]  ball Google AI is obviously online and they're putting in their physical
[47:01.840 --> 47:09.160]  takeover grids all over the country and the world we're here everybody's got
[47:09.160 --> 47:15.400]  front row seats to the most amazing time in human history pizza hut now when you
[47:15.400 --> 47:21.360]  go in with a face scanning iPad I remember about 12 years ago going down to
[47:21.360 --> 47:26.320]  UT psychology department I was led into the let's just say restricted DARPA
[47:26.320 --> 47:31.920]  areas not anything too restricted but it didn't say restricted and it was all
[47:31.920 --> 47:35.520]  about how they were gonna track your eyes and then pre-order what you were
[47:35.520 --> 47:38.840]  gonna get people thought I was crazy it was to predict the future that's now in
[47:38.840 --> 47:41.960]  place nationwide Walmart Target it's already got it they just haven't announced
[47:41.960 --> 47:45.720]  it to you yet pizza hut is the first and it will of course it's really a lie
[47:45.720 --> 47:50.120]  because it'll get so lazy you just don't have to look anymore it knows what I
[47:50.120 --> 47:54.240]  want just like Google gives you the searches you want putting you in your
[47:54.240 --> 47:57.600]  own compartment just like Amazon announced a year ago when I first
[47:57.600 --> 47:59.600]  announced this people didn't believe me even though it was in the New York Times
[47:59.600 --> 48:05.520]  that they with a 99.9% accuracy know what you're going to order on Amazon if
[48:05.520 --> 48:10.920]  you're a frequent shopper there before you do it off of how your mouse moves
[48:10.920 --> 48:15.080]  over things and what you do see that's beyond just surveilling you and two
[48:15.080 --> 48:18.760]  eyeballs looking at you but you're not designing your biology to worry about a
[48:18.760 --> 48:22.640]  computer screen or a camera if you saw a guy's eyes looking through your window
[48:22.640 --> 48:26.200]  you'd probably get a gun and run out and go after him because how dare that person
[48:26.200 --> 48:28.480]  come in your backyard look through your window at night while you're sitting
[48:28.480 --> 48:36.040]  around with your family around that turkey but when it's all just fiber optic
[48:36.040 --> 48:42.120]  run by DARPA but so it doesn't threaten everybody we'll call it Google and we'll
[48:42.120 --> 48:47.360]  have movies about the Google interns and how fun everything is and how it's all
[48:47.360 --> 48:52.160]  cute and cuddly kind of like the press secretaries are the little cheeky
[48:52.160 --> 48:56.360]  trendy non-threatening guys that make the reporters who are egomaniacs feel
[48:56.360 --> 49:00.880]  powerful so they won't challenge him too much because he's weak all of its
[49:00.880 --> 49:06.600]  psych warfare top people with 200 IQs came up with every bit of it and idiots
[49:06.600 --> 49:11.080]  like the new press secretary don't even know Obama doesn't even know he wants to
[49:11.080 --> 49:17.600]  watch Sports Center use drugs have sex and play golf he's a front but I've got
[49:17.600 --> 49:23.480]  to destroy him politically because he is on the front of the ship he's the
[49:23.480 --> 49:28.680]  goddess they've got out there on the Capitol he's the front he's the figure

[50:13.560 --> 50:18.200]  had his had his hands up when the cops murdered him and they should be not
[50:18.200 --> 50:22.720]  just the one cop but the others for hating and abetting manslaughter it's
[50:22.720 --> 50:30.960]  manslaughter plain and simple ind item but notice they got that all scheduled

[50:43.000 --> 50:49.720]  a cover everybody should decry both the police and other crazy thugs I'm not
[50:49.720 --> 50:55.160]  saying all police are crazy thugs the point is those cops no no if fans are

[01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:22.160]  Together a nine-minute report for info wars nightly news and it's now up on info wars.com
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:26.960]  and prisonplanet.com the headline is the race war is a trap and I'm gonna have
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:30.720]  this tweeted out right now at real Alex Jones on Twitter I'm gonna play about
[01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:34.720]  five minutes of it we're gonna go to break come back with fellow Schlafly but
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:39.160]  this is a very important video stay with us
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:46.440]  we're gonna break down the high treason of open borders when Obama's done. They
[01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:54.360]  organize nonviolent resistance is the most powerful weapon weapon that oppressed
[01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:59.560]  people can use in breaking a loose from the bondage of oppression now the other
[01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:05.080]  method that one might use is that of resignation or acquiescence but I think
[01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:11.320]  that is just as bad as violence because non-cooperation with evil is as much a
[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:21.720]  moral obligation as his cooperation with good. When I hear the young people around
[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:33.400]  this table talk about their experiences it violates my belief in what America can
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:42.160]  be to hear young people feeling marginalized and distrustful even after
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:45.640]  they've done everything right.
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:54.160]  I got a lot of heat from the quote black community last week for
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:58.600]  criticizing shooting at police and firefighters and shooting up their
[01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:04.600]  vehicles and shooting two cops and FBI agents got shot and all sorts of stuff
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:12.040]  happened that makes protesting look bad and Time magazine came out and said
[01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:19.960]  violent riots necessary close quote. What burning down your own neighborhood so
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:24.120]  here's the big question when is it right to have a violent revolution and then
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:29.800]  who do you target? Now everybody knows that the civil rights movement in the
[01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:36.640]  south profess non-violence that people were taught to cover their heads when
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:45.960]  the white mobs came to beat them up and to just endure the spitting the beating
[01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:53.440]  and so forth but violence the violence of the white mob was being used
[01:02:53.440 --> 01:03:04.440]  strategically in those demonstrations so look it's partly a problem of on the
[01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:11.560]  strategy in propaganda you know it's a violent country it's a violent government
[01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:18.720]  it's killing people and they're going to call us violent if we break a window but
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:23.800]  they will do that so probably unless you have good reason for breaking the
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:30.240]  window probably you shouldn't do that unless it's you know a big part of your
[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:37.640]  strategy. Hello I'm Ban Ki-moon Secretary-General of the United Nations we
[01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:43.640]  must disarm to save lives we must disarm so that we can redirect precious
[01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:49.400]  resources to health education and development and what we need to do is
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:53.560]  change the way in which people think about guns especially young people one
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:57.360]  thing that I think is clear with young people and with adults as well is that
[01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:01.240]  we just have to be repetitive about this it's not enough to simply have a catchy
[01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:05.640]  ad on a Monday and then only do it every Monday we need to do this every day of
[01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:09.720]  the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a
[01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:15.000]  vastly different way. Nothing will move until everybody knows or has a family
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:20.120]  member who has been gunned down by a gun accident in this country. Is that when it
[01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:26.080]  will the attitude will change? If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the
[01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:32.720]  United States for an outright ban picking up every one of them Mr. and
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:37.800]  Mrs. America turn them all in I would have done it. That's just half of the
[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:42.720]  excellent report the conclusion is on info wars.com we're gonna tweet that out
[01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:47.760]  right now the the the race war is a trap is the name of the video but notice
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:52.040]  like ice tea said I'll turn my guns in when the government does. Jesse
[01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:59.120]  Ventura said that as well see when they say turn your guns in for peace. The

[01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:25.560]  what you're not paying attention to is the fact that I just took an action to
[01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:37.720]  change the law now so that's point number one point number two point number
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:46.920]  two the way the change in the law works is that we're reprioritizing how we
[01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:55.520]  enforce our immigration laws generally not everybody qualifies for being able
[01:08:55.520 --> 01:09:02.720]  to sign up and register but the change in priorities applies to everybody oh
[01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:07.280]  there you go the point is the point is is the board patrols on record we went
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:12.400]  down to mckellan and showed video of the buses five months ago coming across and
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:16.680]  being loaded onto greyhound buses paid for by the federal government and shipped
[01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:22.200]  into democratic party strongholds to be taken care of by churches and democratic
[01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:27.480]  party operatives who were then paid six to eight thousand dollars for groups of
[01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:33.080]  three youths then their families are allowed to come in only 17% of those
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:38.880]  let in were below the age of 18 but even of your forearm misty can you have it
[01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:43.920]  totally lawless see this executive order businesses are red herring because
[01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:49.720]  he's already just ordered ice not to enforce and ice blew the whistle to us
[01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:54.680]  and others that's the only reason we know about it drudge report calm carried
[01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:57.920]  our stories five months ago a month later the New York Times admitted it
[01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:03.160]  buried in a story that indeed they're bringing him in so republicans wanted to
[01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:06.160]  go after him it wouldn't be oh hey you can't do executive orders that's
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:09.280]  unconstitutional you know we have the power of the laws and the purse which
[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:13.040]  they do it be you already did this they'd have a congressional investigation
[01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:17.720]  they'd have them red-handed and it'd be over and senator sessions has pointed
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:22.280]  out that bainer and mitch mcconnell are going ahead and letting it go through in
[01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:29.600]  this quote deal here's the headline senator sessions house GOP is on the
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:33.960]  verge of breaking 2014 campaign promises she joined us for an hour about a
[01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:37.280]  month ago she's only got to the bottom of the hour today phyllis schlafly
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:43.440]  constitutional lawyer best-selling author founder of the eagle forum dot o rg
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:50.080]  she's got her original book out is a new book a choice and not an echo and she
[01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:54.600]  is the proto tea party founder is what i would call her i would call someone
[01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:58.360]  like ron paul you know the supercharger of the libertarian republican
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:04.360]  crossover but she's definitely the great the great lady of the true
[01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:07.680]  conservative movement and if it wasn't for people like her we'd be in even
[01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:12.040]  worse trouble with these rhinos and neocons today phyllis obviously i want
[01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:15.520]  to get into your book and some of the inside baseball it breaks down but how
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:20.400]  big a deal is this i mean this really is the end of the republic the end of
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:25.600]  congress there's been a lot of signposts on this road to perdition but i don't
[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:30.160]  think i have strong enough words for the constitutional crisis we're in where
[01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:37.440]  on guns un treaties our military our power plants our borders why even have
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:42.200]  a congress if the president is able to do this this is unprecedented phyllis
[01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:45.880]  lafly as a constitutional lawyer where are we right now well alex you're
[01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:49.920]  absolutely right at what she said and there are several items that you pointed
[01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:55.440]  out that i haven't seen in any other news media it's just an outrage and it is
[01:11:55.440 --> 01:12:02.600]  the dust spell death of the car of the country obama's attempt to fundamentally
[01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:07.880]  transform us as he promised when he i went into office and uh...
[01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:12.200]  uh... i think it's outrageous that i am absolutely disappointed
[01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:16.880]  or with the members of congress who are not taking advice of senator session
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:21.520]  that you said and and standing up and fighting and saying how really bad this
[01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:26.240]  is because that he's doing it for democratic votes and he's doing it to
[01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:30.240]  uh... really break down the the american
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:33.000]  uh... system the way it is that
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.080]  and make it a different kind of country
[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:40.720]  and it's not like we're getting immigrants uh... from high-skilled areas
[01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:44.080]  we're getting people that almost vote to a man
[01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:47.800]  for the most radical socialist communist agendas
[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:51.280]  uh... what i don't like that's all i know they come from a
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:52.720]  our country where
[01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:56.800]  the government was everything they don't know anything about our constitutional
[01:12:56.800 --> 01:13:01.640]  principles of limited government and and balance of budget and and uh...
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:03.800]  to keep spending down
[01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:06.800]  they're not familiar with any arguments like that
[01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:11.680]  and uh... so why it is just an outrage and i'm so disappointed
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:15.640]  in the uh... republicans in congress who are not standing up
[01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:18.720]  and yelling and screaming about what he's doing
[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:23.080]  many historians have pointed out that uh... other great republics empires
[01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:25.440]  nations go the way of rome
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:27.400]  it follows the same pattern
[01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:31.240]  uh... we are going the way of rome bringing in the giant third world
[01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:32.640]  populations
[01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:36.960]  and it seems to be an accelerated collapse of rome timetable now
[01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:39.360]  uh... yes you're absolutely right and
[01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:41.880]  and i think that's what the old mama wants
[01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:44.520]  he does not want america to be exceptional
[01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:47.760]  he doesn't want us to be religious or christian
[01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:50.600]  uh... he wants to absolutely changes
[01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:53.400]  so that we're no better than any other country
[01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:56.680]  and uh... i think we are better that's why everybody in the whole world wants
[01:13:56.680 --> 01:13:57.640]  to come here
[01:13:57.640 --> 01:14:02.280]  well we certainly were exceptional by every metric inventions trailblazing
[01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:04.160]  profits uh... growth
[01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:07.160]  human rights i mean we were exceptional
[01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:10.920]  uh... now i think we're kind of a paradox of some exceptionalism but also
[01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:13.400]  a lot of the exceptional corruption
[01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:15.920]  exceptional bizarro behavior
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:20.040]  uh... the democrats especially get away with exceptional lying
[01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:21.760]  what do you make though
[01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:24.680]  just a month after that historic election
[01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:26.360]  almost to the day
[01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:30.000]  it'll be to the day tomorrow a month after that landslide
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.720]  that's serious message
[01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:33.720]  or even people like bob bar
[01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:36.840]  couldn't get elected because he was seen as establishment in georgia
[01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:39.880]  that's that should be a message to baner
[01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:41.600]  and a message to mcconnell
[01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:44.240]  and we should see a revolt and they should be removed
[01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:46.160]  from their positions of leadership
[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:49.800]  uh... i mean we need to see that happen don't we fellas well we certainly do
[01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:52.360]  unfortunately i don't see it happening
[01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:55.400]  because of certain collegiality that goes on
[01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:57.240]  in the house of representatives
[01:14:57.240 --> 01:14:59.000]  but uh... tea parties we
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.200]  and of course they've been
[01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:02.280]  media smeared the tea parties
[01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:04.920]  who uh... are the big opposition to
[01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:06.880]  to baner in the house
[01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:10.040]  but it's so important that they rise up and
[01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:13.360]  and that the american people the grassroots realize
[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:16.600]  that the fight today is within the republican party
[01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:20.120]  uh... and uh... that's why i wrote my book a choice not an echo
[01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:23.120]  if the fight between the so-called establishment
[01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:26.120]  that people we used to call the rockefeller republicans and now we
[01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:28.040]  call them the rhinos
[01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:29.840]  uh... establishment
[01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:32.320]  uh... republican and name only
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:35.880]  uh... but in any event it's the money people who want to bring in the cheap
[01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:36.920]  labor
[01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:38.720]  uh... who want to make us uh...
[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:41.720]  uh... but uh... play on the global stage and
[01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:46.240]  all obama wants to be a globalist instead of an american
[01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:47.360]  and uh...
[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:50.680]  uh... we've heard from people who've just really got to rise up and
[01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:55.880]  and the only one is speaking real good sense on it is going to session
[01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:59.320]  that's right ran paul has said it's clearly unconstitutional but it's so
[01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:00.360]  clearly
[01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:05.400]  separately from the immigration and in north american union aspects of this
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:10.520]  we've never seen a president act this unilaterally when reagan and bush senior
[01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:12.160]  did limited uh...
[01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:14.440]  legalizations or amnesties
[01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:17.120]  uh... which i don't think we're good to begin with the it was in line with
[01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:19.960]  congress and laws they just passed
[01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:22.280]  and not when they were at loggerheads
[01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:25.400]  and against the will the american people in common sense
[01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:28.280]  uh... i just don't see how he gets away with this
[01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:32.080]  without a accelerated slide in the dictatorship
[01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:36.280]  and uh... another thing that gives me a pain is when they cite reagan as giving
[01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:37.400]  amnesty
[01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:42.040]  and he asked reagan it wasn't perfect he did make a mistake he did give amnesty to
[01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:43.040]  a bunch of them
[01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:45.080]  but he admitted it was a mistake
[01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:46.360]  and we learned from it
[01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:50.480]  because they promised that that would end the illegal coming across the border
[01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:51.920]  and of course it didn't
[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:57.200]  they had more and more came because they got a free pass into the u.s.
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:00.520]  and so we ought to learn from our mistake
[01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:04.520]  that's right but but even though reagan said it was a mistake he did he was
[01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:06.640]  working with congress is my point
[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:10.840]  yes that's correct and of course obama said he has a pen and
[01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:12.200]  a phone and
[01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:15.480]  if congress doesn't do what he wants he's going to do it anyway
[01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:18.720]  and then congress doesn't respond to that
[01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:21.240]  well except for a lame lawsuit
[01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:25.080]  and then obama brad's and says he changed the law how could i guess he's
[01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:27.600]  really trying to break us
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:31.320]  well i think he's trying to break our country i really do
[01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:32.360]  and uh...
[01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:35.360]  in fact he's almost said as much
[01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:39.840]  he really meant it when he said he wanted to fundamentally transform us
[01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:42.840]  and we like to think we're over the rule of law
[01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:45.840]  uh... that we're a constitutional government that we
[01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:48.600]  uh... stand by the constitution
[01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:49.760]  and uh...
[01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:50.800]  somehow
[01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:53.440]  uh... most of the congressman or not now
[01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:55.640]  now there's uh... group of the
[01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:57.600]  conservatives in the house
[01:17:57.600 --> 01:17:58.480]  uh... meeting
[01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:01.720]  this morning at this one thing you know they made on wednesday
[01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:05.120]  and uh... i hope they're going to come out with that
[01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:08.800]  uh... some uh... at least at least some talk about
[01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:12.560]  uh... holly unconstitutional what obama's doing
[01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:16.720]  uh... it's a conservative group that's led by steve king is one of the few good
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:17.640]  guys
[01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:18.920]  in the house
[01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:20.720]  and uh... i hope they
[01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:25.640]  i hope we'll hear something and i hope it'll be reported by the media
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:28.560]  uh... i want to skip this network break as we have limited time with phyllis
[01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:30.560]  laffley founder of eagle forum
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:33.560]  you can go to eagle forum dot o r g and valuable
[01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:35.960]  information also find a column there
[01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:37.560]  and more on her new book
[01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:40.120]  uh... which again is of the same name but a new book
[01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:42.920]  uh... on uh... under the original classic name
[01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:45.080]  a choice on an echo
[01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:47.680]  when you talk about the the
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:51.080]  people trying to be gentlemanly in the house and wait their turn to move up the
[01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:52.920]  ranks of power
[01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:56.040]  are we going to see our country completely broken and brought into global
[01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:57.880]  governance of the north american union
[01:18:57.880 --> 01:18:59.800]  and a new voting block brought in
[01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:02.800]  to be servile lap dogs to the worst elements
[01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:04.360]  of the power structure
[01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:06.080]  on
[01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:09.520]  the alter of being friendly in congress
[01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:12.840]  and not being persecuted are not being kept off committees
[01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:15.920]  i mean don't these congressmen and women know if they would do the right
[01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:16.880]  thing
[01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:20.560]  people would come to their aid and they would be rock stars
[01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:21.960]  uh... in this country
[01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:25.280]  uh... instead of creeping along like a bunch of lawyers
[01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:27.240]  and and and and compromising
[01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:29.880]  but but but even a compromise means
[01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:32.120]  the other side gives something up no no
[01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:35.960]  compromising under this system means we just do whatever we're told
[01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:38.320]  and i wonder if we go along with this
[01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:40.160]  what more can they do
[01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:43.360]  well that they're going to come with executive orders on guns
[01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:46.520]  and fellas i'm afraid that's going to start a civil war
[01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:48.360]  well i i think
[01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:52.240]  he will come with executive orders on all sorts of things and guns may be on
[01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:53.200]  their list they
[01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:55.120]  or say hey the second amendment
[01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:57.080]  you know former of the former
[01:19:57.080 --> 01:19:59.240]  bandit was on the u.s. supreme court
[01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:03.200]  has written a new book and he won five new amendments to the constitution
[01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:05.800]  and one of them really is uh... getting rid
[01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:08.400]  of the uh... of the gun amendment
[01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:09.400]  and uh...
[01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:11.840]  so uh...
[01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:16.200]  the the people who hate the constitution out there and the american people are just
[01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:17.760]  going to have to stand up
[01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:21.240]  and stand up for what we believe it
[01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:25.560]  look it into your crystal ball you've seen a lot and i want to shift gears
[01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:29.640]  into your book what we can learn from it about what's happening now
[01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:34.960]  where do you really see america going because globalist are are really a cult
[01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:37.720]  and they get such money and power out of the fact that the u.n. and these
[01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:39.880]  multinationals can manage things
[01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:43.440]  and they can make money off crises they can make money off booms
[01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:47.640]  uh... they really aren't based in the free market or reality
[01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:50.120]  the crony capitalist that fund them
[01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:54.200]  uh... want full control so they're persecuting
[01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:57.960]  any type of real free market system just seeing it as competition
[01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:00.640]  when really they're just exterminating the environment
[01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:05.840]  uh... of of economics that's allowed our civilization to even function
[01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:07.840]  it just seems suicidal
[01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:10.080]  by the elite what i see them doing
[01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:14.560]  uh... well i like you said very well i can't say it better but i will point out
[01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:17.640]  uh... that when george bush to became president
[01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:21.680]  his big thing was to put us into a north american union
[01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:23.200]  with open borders
[01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:25.440]  uh... with canada and mexico
[01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:30.160]  and the evil farm fought that very hard and we beam on that no nobody
[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:34.080]  with uh... nobody's really talking about the north american union anymore
[01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:37.200]  exactly so now it's back by stealth as they said they would do in the band canada
[01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:40.880]  meeting from the secret documents judicial watch got so how do we beat a
[01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:44.480]  stealth integration that we're witnessing right now well uh... with
[01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:47.480]  talk show host like you bring the truth out
[01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:51.000]  uh... talk show is a great advantage to our cause
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:54.120]  because it brings the information to the public
[01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:57.920]  they can't get in any other way and so i think you for that please don't we're
[01:21:57.920 --> 01:21:59.600]  in this together
[01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:04.800]  well we we've got to we've got to alert the american people that what's going on
[01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:07.560]  and uh... you'll form a better leader
[01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:11.160]  uh... we we oppose all of this by partisanship
[01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:12.520]  uh... idea
[01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:16.080]  i'm telling my book how
[01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:18.280]  andy burger was signed
[01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:22.600]  they go give a speech to the builder burgers at the library congress
[01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:27.400]  and say that by part of the center it was what we really want to work toward
[01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:28.520]  and uh...
[01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:29.960]  and bush uh...
[01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:32.440]  currently the right on behalf of bush
[01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:35.600]  announced that yes that's what they're going to go for
[01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:36.520]  and uh...
[01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:38.800]  we don't want these globalists
[01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:40.880]  uh... we do we want
[01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:42.880]  because america is unique
[01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:46.320]  it's not only exceptional if you need her
[01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:50.800]  and i was beyond that it's beyond that it's not like we're being conquered by
[01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:52.200]  something better
[01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:55.280]  we're being conquered by a shyster scam
[01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:57.560]  fractional reserve banking
[01:22:57.560 --> 01:22:59.840]  fraudulent system
[01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:03.920]  that makes us bail out their global derivatives
[01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:07.080]  and plans to make us even worse debt slaves
[01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:08.640]  uh... i mean this is
[01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:11.400]  this is just over the top bad
[01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:15.800]  and so what do we do then about this reason and and back to the question i
[01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:16.680]  interrupted
[01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:20.000]  what is your gut tell you is going to happen in this country
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:24.080]  because i understand we've beaten the stuff before but how do you stop
[01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:27.760]  we're going to be there again because you and i are going to write up the
[01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:29.520]  grass roots and get them to
[01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:31.560]  take care and i'm telling you
[01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:34.640]  that if you want if you want to have an impact
[01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:38.120]  you've got to do it within the republican party because your hope of
[01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:39.080]  doing it through
[01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:40.360]  the democratic party
[01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:42.400]  or through some third party
[01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:43.840]  it's going nowhere
[01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:46.320]  you've got to do it with the republican party
[01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:50.160]  get the right people nominated and elected to the republican convention
[01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:52.000]  coming up in twenty sixteen
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.280]  so that we get a good pro-american president
[01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:58.000]  and read my book a choice not an echo
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:01.240]  which tells all the shenanigans the republicans have been
[01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:05.440]  engaging in since nineteen sixty four it's right up to date
[01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:11.920]  and it's kind of your handbook for action as we approach the next presidential election
[01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:15.440]  absolutely you know i've always been for third parties the state level uh...
[01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:18.600]  third party it was like ross perot could have won
[01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:20.960]  but clearly the entire power structure
[01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:23.040]  is lined up to defeat
[01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:25.240]  a takeover of the republican party
[01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:27.520]  by the constitutional movement
[01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:30.400]  and that tells you that's one of our only shots
[01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:33.040]  that's why they're spending all their time and energy
[01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:34.440]  bipartisanly
[01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:36.240]  to try to shut that down
[01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:39.480]  that's right and by part of the news is still good
[01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:42.320]  we don't want to go halfway with the people
[01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:44.360]  who want globalist answers
[01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:47.040]  uh... we want the american way and
[01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:49.920]  and they show that it's better and unique and
[01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:55.360]  and uh... that's what we have to rile up the people to do
[01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:56.360]  and get yourself
[01:24:56.360 --> 01:25:00.640]  uh... close enough to the party that you get elected to be a delegate to the next
[01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:02.200]  republican convention
[01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:06.800]  this is the way we did it in nineteen sixty four when we nominated barry goldwater
[01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:12.120]  and it can be done again we did it in nineteen eighty when we nominated ronald reagan
[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:13.200]  uh... but you've
[01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:19.880]  got to give up this idea of going down the third path which leads to nowhere
[01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:24.800]  well said and there's also some hope here
[01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:30.320]  there is imperial hubris by the rhino republicans and by the democrats
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:35.480]  uh... this latest thing where the white house is nominating a soap opera producer
[01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:38.320]  calling bell with no
[01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:41.640]  governing uh... experience doesn't speak
[01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:42.960]  hungarian
[01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:45.440]  uh... doesn't know anything about them
[01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:48.840]  uh... but all these hollywood folks want
[01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:51.720]  to be in government and government wants to be in hollywood
[01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:54.280]  so it's really a bunch of peacock narcissists
[01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:56.000]  that aren't very serious people
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:59.240]  here and they're buying their way in with donations
[01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:01.400]  absolutely so the fact that
[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:06.680]  uh... that uh... that we've got such a corrupt group means that if we just fight
[01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:08.120]  back against them
[01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:11.000]  uh... they're not even really serious people at this point
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.640]  when you look at the democrats
[01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:15.320]  i've got to say i think they're really soft
[01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:16.680]  they're screwed up
[01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:18.400]  uh... and
[01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:21.000]  i just think that uh... they're ready to fall
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:22.320]  if we simply
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:23.800]  stand up to them
[01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:27.880]  uh... yeah i think you're right i'm very optimistic and i think that the
[01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:29.640]  the election the other day
[01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:33.520]  uh... wish the american people overwhelmingly said no thanks from
[01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:34.640]  obama said
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:35.640]  his agenda
[01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:36.600]  was on the
[01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:37.480]  ballot
[01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:38.880]  uh... well
[01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:42.400]  then okay we take that and we rejected it
[01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:43.560]  and uh...
[01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:47.840]  uh... i think we can do likewise in the next presidential election and uh...
[01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:51.920]  make it a good make it a great year to save our country
[01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:56.080]  fellas what do you think is going to happen to the republican leaders that
[01:26:56.080 --> 01:26:58.800]  what can we the people as a grassroots expert who's
[01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:02.600]  often the grassroots right in the white house with reagan as uh... one of his
[01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:04.160]  top advisors
[01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:06.760]  where we
[01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:09.520]  where are the best places for the grassroots
[01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:11.680]  to lobby and target
[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:16.080]  to get some good behavior out of people like john bainer
[01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:20.320]  well you've got to go after your local republicans and make
[01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:23.360]  make friends with the people who are party officials
[01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:25.920]  county chairman precinct commitment
[01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:28.600]  and and so that they will help you
[01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:29.800]  get to be elected
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:32.240]  a delegate to the next convention
[01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:33.280]  and uh...
[01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:37.640]  you you need to be a player in the republican party
[01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:41.880]  uh... you it's just not good enough to expound on your
[01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:44.520]  independent views somewhere else
[01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:47.800]  uh... you're not in the in the fight where it is
[01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:51.800]  and the fight is in the republican party and that's where we need to
[01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:54.040]  need to play it and we need to win
[01:27:54.040 --> 01:27:55.560]  and we have proved
[01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:57.080]  that we can win
[01:27:57.080 --> 01:27:58.440]  and so
[01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:01.080]  join me in doing
[01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:05.680]  it's going to be one hell of a fight that's certainly clear well the founder
[01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:08.360]  and head of the eagle forum eagle forum dot o r g
[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:10.760]  phyllis laughley her new book is out of choice

[01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:17.560]  you too
[01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:21.120]  uh... folks i cannot stress enough
[01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:25.120]  how dire the straits are
[01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:26.360]  if they can
[01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:30.080]  in the borders and bring in unlimited numbers of people
[01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:32.440]  they can politically
[01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:35.680]  push any agenda and they will
[01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:38.160]  battleground texas the democrats have said
[01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:41.760]  they will take over they will get our guns
[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:45.240]  because they will bring in the illegals and
[01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:49.600]  get the law change so they can vote
[01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:51.760]  the system is not
[01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:53.800]  even hiding this they're very
[01:28:53.800 --> 01:28:58.760]  arrogant about this but beyond that
[01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:02.200]  what will the government do next the so-called government which is the
[01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:05.200]  special interest that control the president
[01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:08.760]  as bad as congress is it's a check in a balance and
[01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:11.400]  congress won't do this amnesty
[01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:14.840]  but they don't want the political blame for it because the people aren't for it
[01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:18.840]  so they're gonna let obama do it and take the blame
[01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:24.000]  i've got to say john bainer and mitch mcconnell are worse than barack obama
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:25.400]  that just hit me
[01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:28.800]  they are worse than barack obama because at least
[01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:31.600]  he still lies about it stuff but at least he takes some credit
[01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:34.600]  at least he's more truthful
[01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:38.920]  well that just hit me john bainer is a bigger liar than barack obama
[01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:41.960]  john bainer is worse than barack obama
[01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:44.520]  he really is he really is
[01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:46.120]  a total trader

[01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:29.680]  most of these talk show hosts are sick of fan narcissist
[01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:32.800]  they want to be told how great they are i don't i want to hear what you have to
[01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:37.680]  say i want to meet and don't say i want to
[01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:40.480]  talk about this and that i'm not call screening you

[01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:52.480]  now i may be rude because back 10 years ago when i used to take a lot of phone
[01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:54.640]  calls because i used to be good at it for some reason
[01:34:54.640 --> 01:34:57.920]  i think is i used to have the phone board in front of me
[01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:00.320]  then i started doing the show out of my house for a while and i would just let
[01:35:00.320 --> 01:35:03.040]  the network go to him and i'd say let's go to this color let's go to that
[01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:05.600]  caller that's i think if i had the red lights in
[01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:08.560]  front of me i would just take a lot of calls and i got in the habit of not
[01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:11.120]  doing it i've never broken myself entirely
[01:35:11.120 --> 01:35:14.480]  so we've had this discussion 150 times on air probably in the last 10 years
[01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:16.880]  but sometimes i do and i'm getting a little bit better

[01:41:57.440 --> 01:42:00.720]  thousand dollars
[01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:06.560]  for not letting the person use the girl's bathroom
[01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:10.240]  uh that's what's really important folks meanwhile nato and russia move closer
[01:42:10.240 --> 01:42:14.560]  to war we're going to get into eric garner
[01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:18.240]  i believe manslaughter by the police and by that i don't believe they meant to
[01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:21.200]  kill him but they still should have known
[01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:24.400]  it's like you punch somebody and they hit their head on the cement and you didn't
[01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:27.520]  have a reason to punch them you get a manslaughter charge
[01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:31.840]  but they could actually do a pure murder charge because
[01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:33.920]  i don't know you could argue they knew what they were doing when he was begging
[01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:36.560]  for his life and let me tell you the reason i blew up yesterday and then i had
[01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:40.160]  a headache all day and i i didn't sleep well last night
[01:42:40.160 --> 01:42:46.400]  and i was very upset this morning i have a lot of empathy for people and the
[01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:51.600]  thomas kelly video and this garner video
[01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:55.680]  i psychoanalyzed today it hit me when i was working on the elliptical
[01:42:55.680 --> 01:43:00.960]  why i'm so angry when you hear somebody begging for their life who hadn't done
[01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:06.000]  anything it makes me angry and i know why people
[01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:11.680]  get angry but thug criminals that are just pure
[01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:16.400]  racist who want to piggyback on people that are angry
[01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:19.360]  are the scum of the earth and are actually aiding and abetting bad cops
[01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:22.800]  being able to murder people but man i tell you listen to these
[01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:27.040]  guys beg for their lives while these cops get off on killing them is it just
[01:43:27.040 --> 01:43:30.880]  it really makes me angry and the answer is getting control of our police
[01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:34.000]  departments and getting these people trained and if somebody wants to be a
[01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:37.120]  killer like this guy that says i'm gonna go up here and kill this homeless guy
[01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:41.760]  and he goes up and kills him and the cops give him an award for it
[01:43:41.760 --> 01:43:45.600]  those are some sick freaks in albuquerque and we've interviewed
[01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:49.280]  it's gotta be like seven or eight so many whistleblowers i said we're not the
[01:43:49.280 --> 01:43:52.880]  albuquerque channel i had to tell the reporters i rarely get involved
[01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:56.000]  because they're all real smart and have good instincts but i said listen too much
[01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:59.520]  albuquerque two or three times a week isn't it you know it's too much
[01:43:59.520 --> 01:44:03.360]  we're not an albuquerque news station we're a world station i said do
[01:44:03.360 --> 01:44:07.520]  once a month condensed reports with whistleblowers on the latest police
[01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:11.680]  murders and and out of control psycho behavior that's more effective anyways
[01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:17.040]  at telling the truth show the pattern don't just every day have the albuquerque
[01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:20.960]  police doing new horrible things
[01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:26.960]  because the public doesn't even perceive it uh as albuquerque they see it as cops
[01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:30.960]  and cops biggest problem is cops
[01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:35.200]  because they've been federalized they've been given hardcore killer training
[01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:38.240]  yeah great killer training is wonderful if you're in the military and you're
[01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:42.160]  about to go into a foxhole and turn on the killer
[01:44:42.160 --> 01:44:48.080]  i get it folks believe me i get it but you don't turn on killer with some guy

[01:45:13.680 --> 01:45:17.040]  let's go to john in texas and jay dave eddie and peter john you're on the
[01:45:17.040 --> 01:45:22.000]  year go ahead hi alex welcome
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:26.320]  you know back in 1964 my dad gave me a copy of a book called none they're called
[01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:30.720]  treason by john stormer yes and anyway in that book
[01:45:30.720 --> 01:45:35.440]  they had a position paper that one of the dulls brothers who was a member of the
[01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:40.000]  roeser administration back in 1942 world war two was just kicking in the
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:43.120]  high gear and they laid out their long-range plans and he said one of
[01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:46.080]  the plans was they're going to merge the communist and the capitalist system
[01:45:46.080 --> 01:45:49.600]  together and it's been done yeah that's actually the
[01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:54.080]  carnage endowment and was declassified in hearings
[01:45:54.080 --> 01:45:58.320]  by anthony sutton the congressional expert in the 70s but so what you're
[01:45:58.320 --> 01:46:02.880]  saying is public and also that i always thought
[01:46:02.880 --> 01:46:06.400]  that the collapse of the soviet union was a fraud because it was always part of
[01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:09.920]  the plan that they would come on board the the global government you know
[01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:12.800]  they just had to wait for the right moment and then they launched it you
[01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:16.880]  know that's right brother there's a new
[01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:20.960]  article out by the council on fine relations cfr.org
[01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:24.480]  that kit daggers is going to a story on the day of tomorrow
[01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:30.640]  where it openly says use a dizzying array of dangers from the resource
[01:46:30.640 --> 01:46:33.680]  competition and overfishing to climate change
[01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:38.800]  to bring in a justification for global takeover
[01:46:39.280 --> 01:46:43.440]  a law quote the report from iron mountain
[01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:48.720]  unbelievable admission by these people it is just so creepy how out in the open
[01:46:48.720 --> 01:46:52.080]  they are one of the things they've been using is
[01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:55.520]  gradual that's the tough thing about this is they've been using gradual a
[01:46:55.520 --> 01:46:59.840]  little bit at a time where it's hard to wake up people you know that uh
[01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:03.200]  that they they figure over the long term that they're going to win but we'll go
[01:47:03.200 --> 01:47:06.480]  if we have to do five steps backward to go 10
[01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:12.160]  step forward they'll do it you know and i agree with you and now though
[01:47:12.160 --> 01:47:16.640]  see we've gotten to the emerging point the flashpoint where all the gradualism
[01:47:16.640 --> 01:47:20.160]  finally gets so intense that oh by the way i don't need
[01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:24.160]  congress anymore by the way i've just taken your guns by the way the nsa is
[01:47:24.160 --> 01:47:27.600]  just buying on you illegally by the way there were cancer viruses in those
[01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:31.280]  shots by the way the flu shot did kill a bunch of people
[01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:35.600]  that's the point they're getting to with everybody right now
[01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:39.360]  is just flaunting it in our face great to hear from you john
[01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:44.880]  dave in pennsylvania you're on the air go ahead yes alex a couple weeks ago jesse
[01:47:44.880 --> 01:47:48.560]  ventura was on coast to coast a m and a caller called in and
[01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:52.400]  mentioned it to him about the guillotine that that are at these army bases and
[01:47:52.400 --> 01:47:56.080]  jesse had no idea about it and i was wondering if he could please pass that
[01:47:56.080 --> 01:47:59.840]  information on to jesse well i would love to if i was
[01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:02.800]  supposed to call him last week and never did it i'm calling today
[01:48:02.800 --> 01:48:07.360]  about some other stuff we're working on but
[01:48:07.360 --> 01:48:10.880]  it's a perennial thing because they introduced a bill
[01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:16.640]  decades ago and the nohide laws to start using guillotines for
[01:48:16.640 --> 01:48:21.760]  execution and then christians saw that as as revelation coming through so it's
[01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:25.280]  kind of one of those urban legends you can't get rid of the military bases
[01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:28.400]  are openly training to mow down crowds of peaceful people
[01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:32.080]  and what they call zombie training zombie wave attack training
[01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:35.840]  and and they are having rendition and secret grabbing of citizens so
[01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:41.040]  and the ndaa so that's all real and that stuff does go on at black sites or
[01:48:41.040 --> 01:48:45.840]  ghost sites as they call it but they generally don't
[01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:50.560]  they generally when they decide to kill you they like beating people to death
[01:48:50.560 --> 01:48:54.400]  or they waterboard you till you die with your head in a bucket
[01:48:54.400 --> 01:48:58.000]  they really don't use guillotines but i appreciate your call but but but i could
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:01.600]  talk to him about that if you've got info on guillotines please send it to me
[01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:06.880]  eddie in new york you're on the air yes sir i wanted to talk about the
[01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:10.800]  supposed shootings and Ferguson with the police officers
[01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:15.040]  and um i haven't heard anything on mainstream media about it i only hear
[01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:18.240]  you talking about it and i remember carjaxon was
[01:49:18.240 --> 01:49:22.080]  saying that there was gunshots all night long so was joe big
[01:49:22.080 --> 01:49:26.000]  but there was two cop cars on fire and they had cases of ammo inside of them
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:30.000]  exploding could those be the gunshots that they heard and i know they wanted
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:31.920]  a few blocks away sure well it was reported by the
[01:49:31.920 --> 01:49:34.400]  associated press and others they were wearing body armor but
[01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:37.840]  bullets hitting and deflect up and you get shrapnel
[01:49:37.840 --> 01:49:42.800]  two fbi got shot in crime related to it but they said it wasn't critical and
[01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:47.040]  they said two officers were shot they could be lying government lies so much
[01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:51.600]  but i've seen footage and heard people say let's burn stuff down
[01:49:51.600 --> 01:49:55.120]  uh let me tell you i think might have been there might have been business
[01:49:55.120 --> 01:49:58.560]  owners that are sick of it that piggybacked on the riots to burn down
[01:49:58.560 --> 01:50:02.240]  their own businesses or there were people
[01:50:02.240 --> 01:50:06.000]  some of it looks like inside job there's video that looks like cops throwing a
[01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:10.000]  flashbang in a car then burns up that's what a flashbang usually does a lot of
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:13.280]  times so yes sir anything's possible i just don't
[01:50:13.280 --> 01:50:17.600]  speculate and sandy hook they had noses disappearing
[01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:21.600]  and clearly had green screens and and it was fake
[01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:24.800]  and then i've had top experts on that go yeah it's fake i mean if i see something
[01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:28.880]  that i can say is fake i'll say it i said the underwear bombing was fake
[01:50:28.880 --> 01:50:32.160]  and it turned out it was congress had to admit that the cia
[01:50:32.160 --> 01:50:35.600]  got mutalib on the plane drugged up and he had a firecracker in his pants
[01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:39.360]  one week before the naked body scanners rolled out so i mean you know what's

[01:55:12.640 --> 01:55:16.000]  are now betraying everyone yet again saying we won't shut the government

[01:55:27.440 --> 01:55:31.920]  everything is inverted so are you upset about this that's one of the questions
[01:55:31.920 --> 01:55:35.760]  i'm throwing out to listeners uh let's go to eddie in new york to finish up
[01:55:35.760 --> 01:55:39.520]  his point go ahead uh yes sir i just wanted to mention the
[01:55:39.520 --> 01:55:43.920]  fact like i said uh i was watching a live stream feed from bossam i believe
[01:55:43.920 --> 01:55:46.640]  joe bigs uh was the one that reported that he had his
[01:55:46.640 --> 01:55:51.520]  camera stolen while he was um recording um and he was the one that i seen on his
[01:55:51.520 --> 01:55:55.120]  feed of the two cop cars that was on fire and you can hear the gunshots
[01:55:55.120 --> 01:55:58.960]  um flying out of the cars and people were like man how many bullets were in
[01:55:58.960 --> 01:56:02.480]  there and that's what i said i heard jacari jackson saying oh there was gun
[01:56:02.480 --> 01:56:06.640]  shots all night now your reporters were a few blocks away from i seen their feed
[01:56:06.640 --> 01:56:10.240]  too and they showed the cop car for they were standing pretty far away but they
[01:56:10.240 --> 01:56:13.760]  never mentioned anything about the gunshots coming out of those cars
[01:56:13.760 --> 01:56:18.480]  and then you hear about the the fbi agent's cops being shot but you only
[01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:22.240]  hear it in one report i mean you would think that would be nationwide
[01:56:22.240 --> 01:56:26.800]  mainstream media news well we'll look into that but joe bigs has been around a
[01:56:26.800 --> 01:56:30.160]  lot of shots and he said they were going over his head
[01:56:30.160 --> 01:56:33.600]  and i believe you're mixing that with another reporter i believe joe didn't
[01:56:33.600 --> 01:56:37.280]  have his camera stolen did he that was another reporter that happened live
[01:56:37.280 --> 01:56:40.000]  with the live streaming yeah no no no so sir you're
[01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:44.400]  confusing some things but we'll we'll look into that i appreciate your
[01:56:44.400 --> 01:56:48.640]  your call uh look there are gangs of people beating people's heads in with
[01:56:48.640 --> 01:56:51.760]  hammers there are gangs of people racially
[01:56:51.760 --> 01:56:56.640]  targeting white folks it's wrong uh there are people shooting
[01:56:56.640 --> 01:57:01.600]  now do i put it past the feds the stage something
[01:57:01.600 --> 01:57:06.720]  absolutely i think they would do it but i don't know i don't have any evidence
[01:57:06.720 --> 01:57:10.560]  peter in washington you're on the air welcome
[01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:14.320]  uh yes um i i you know i think you're probably right on
[01:57:14.320 --> 01:57:18.720]  bainer but uh you're wrong on zimmerman
[01:57:18.720 --> 01:57:23.040]  i believe um i mean i think zimmerman was stupid to follow him
[01:57:23.040 --> 01:57:26.480]  and now zimmerman's been a bunch of trouble afterwards and he seems to have
[01:57:26.480 --> 01:57:29.680]  that syndrome with guys that aren't really bad but they just get into trouble
[01:57:29.680 --> 01:57:34.000]  and think they're superman but i i i was saying the justice department
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:37.360]  tried to stir up the zimmerman thing i think trevon was wrong to be on top of
[01:57:37.360 --> 01:57:39.440]  him attacking him and that's why i think
[01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:44.000]  why the jury said not guilty uh but i'm just because
[01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:48.160]  i'm not a i don't think zimmerman's an angel's my point
[01:57:48.160 --> 01:57:51.840]  all right now here's the thing about zimmerman he was an anchor baby i think
[01:57:51.840 --> 01:57:56.640]  he was trying to be a good citizen and and you said the other day well he was
[01:57:56.640 --> 01:58:00.240]  looking for trouble sure he was looking to trying to be to remove
[01:58:00.240 --> 01:58:05.680]  trouble from the neighborhood i think he was just unlucky
[01:58:05.680 --> 01:58:12.080]  you know how would he know that uh they would make a federal case of it
[01:58:12.080 --> 01:58:16.000]  okay this is a difference of opinion between you and me

[02:00:40.560 --> 02:00:45.040]  order lasted about five minutes
[02:00:45.040 --> 02:00:48.400]  senator sessions says the republicans are on the verge of breaking their
[02:00:48.400 --> 02:00:54.080]  campaign promise well yeah folks the republicans basically wrote this plan
[02:00:54.080 --> 02:00:58.320]  the republican blue bloods tried to pass this four times under bush
[02:00:58.320 --> 02:01:01.680]  peter in washington uh you you want to talk about george zimmerman i guess
[02:01:01.680 --> 02:01:07.840]  tying it into the whole situation in in fergusson
[02:01:07.840 --> 02:01:12.800]  the issue here is exactly what charles barkley talked about
[02:01:12.800 --> 02:01:16.320]  when you've got blacks 10 to 12 to 15 times depending on where you're at
[02:01:16.320 --> 02:01:21.760]  more often killing black people where is the outrage about that where is that
[02:01:21.760 --> 02:01:26.080]  in the news well it doesn't help the media
[02:01:26.080 --> 02:01:30.640]  to to show that they want to divide everybody so they don't talk about it
[02:01:30.640 --> 02:01:35.600]  um but then there are real problems out there like
[02:01:35.600 --> 02:01:38.080]  this footage i'm going to play again of eric gardener
[02:01:38.080 --> 02:01:41.200]  chokehold death grand jury decision may be imminent
[02:01:41.200 --> 02:01:43.760]  i'm going to play the video again if you're a radio listener you'll just hear
[02:01:43.760 --> 02:01:47.600]  it i mean he's begging for his life and i noticed this morning i was uh
[02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:52.960]  monitoring uh fox cnn and cbs i was on the
[02:01:52.960 --> 02:01:58.960]  elliptical for like 45 minutes and they were not playing the help me help me
[02:01:58.960 --> 02:02:03.040]  it just goes on and on help me i can't breathe i mean
[02:02:03.040 --> 02:02:07.520]  he didn't do anything that is murdering and all i see
[02:02:07.520 --> 02:02:13.360]  is men killing an innocent person i don't see a black man i don't see cops
[02:02:13.360 --> 02:02:18.160]  i see people killing someone
[02:02:18.160 --> 02:02:20.720]  and then there's this attitude that citizens lives don't matter so it's
[02:02:20.720 --> 02:02:23.360]  just like oh whatever it's like dog crap on my feet you know
[02:02:23.360 --> 02:02:27.120]  whatever you know he kind of me he has his hands up and he kind of goes hey i
[02:02:27.120 --> 02:02:29.760]  didn't do anything and they're like you know they just they just want to
[02:02:29.760 --> 02:02:34.800]  show him his boss are they killing the guys don't play the audio
[02:02:34.800 --> 02:02:39.120]  right now because i want to go to calls and
[02:02:39.120 --> 02:02:42.240]  we're going to play it it just really i figured out it upset me
[02:02:42.240 --> 02:02:46.160]  after i watched it again i watched it a few days ago i watched it months ago
[02:02:46.160 --> 02:02:51.200]  when it happened back in july and i watched it again
[02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:57.680]  this morning and it it it makes me very angry and i understand why
[02:02:57.680 --> 02:03:00.960]  folks can angry seeing this and then the police get away with it
[02:03:00.960 --> 02:03:07.280]  they need to indict those police not just the one that choked him to death
[02:03:07.280 --> 02:03:09.840]  peter i mean what do you think about that what do you think about the cops
[02:03:09.840 --> 02:03:15.440]  killing this father of six on that and uh but that um
[02:03:15.440 --> 02:03:21.840]  you know that those two circumstances uh are entirely different i i don't
[02:03:21.840 --> 02:03:27.360]  disagree with you a bit and i hope that you're able to uh
[02:03:27.360 --> 02:03:34.240]  people like you complaining uh uh loudly are able to get uh uh those people
[02:03:34.240 --> 02:03:39.040]  indicted those policemen indicted i there's as much as a disagreement because
[02:03:39.040 --> 02:03:41.840]  here's the deal he's not resisting them and he's not
[02:03:41.840 --> 02:03:44.720]  endangering them so they can't say that he starts
[02:03:44.720 --> 02:03:47.840]  flopping when they're choking into death well of course and they're like put
[02:03:47.840 --> 02:03:51.040]  your arm behind your back while they sit on it
[02:03:51.040 --> 02:03:54.640]  they did that to thomas kelly it's it's like an excuse to kill somebody
[02:03:54.640 --> 02:03:57.680]  it's like when they're shooting the homeless guy in the back he's already dead they're like
[02:03:57.680 --> 02:04:02.640]  don't don't go for a weapon don't move as he's like
[02:04:02.640 --> 02:04:06.720]  dying he's clearly having a death rattle and then he dies and they're like
[02:04:06.720 --> 02:04:09.440]  shooting him still and letting the dog bite him and they're all excited like
[02:04:09.440 --> 02:04:12.640]  they just brought down a deer or something and it's this isn't even about
[02:04:12.640 --> 02:04:16.800]  being black folks i'm telling you they've hired cops that like to kill people
[02:04:16.800 --> 02:04:21.120]  and those are not the type people you want on a police force or in the military

[02:08:52.480 --> 02:08:55.280]  but i want to get into it in detail you had better
[02:08:55.280 --> 02:08:59.840]  believe that the justice department wanting to distract the public from all
[02:08:59.840 --> 02:09:04.080]  of its crimes and from obama's power grabs
[02:09:04.080 --> 02:09:08.720]  is in there stirring it up and they are involved in the case of eric garner
[02:09:08.720 --> 02:09:13.200]  because by pointing out what bad local cops have done or badly trained ones
[02:09:13.200 --> 02:09:17.280]  bare minimum they can make themselves look good when they're involved in just
[02:09:17.280 --> 02:09:20.800]  every form of corruption you can imagine. eric garner
[02:09:20.800 --> 02:09:28.080]  chokehold death grand jury decision may be imminent cbs news new york reports
[02:09:28.080 --> 02:09:32.400]  they could come today tomorrow a grand jury decision is expected to come soon
[02:09:32.400 --> 02:09:36.000]  the case of a parent police chokehold that killed eric garner
[02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:40.160]  well what about whenever tasers kill people by the thousands
[02:09:40.160 --> 02:09:44.160]  they've upped the power of the tasers now the grand jury began hearing evidence
[02:09:44.160 --> 02:09:49.360]  in the case september 29th this guy was a good guy a good guy in the
[02:09:49.360 --> 02:09:55.920]  community not a criminal six kids trying to stop two thugs
[02:09:55.920 --> 02:09:59.680]  that were fighting it's so often it's it's just like i said when i saved that
[02:09:59.680 --> 02:10:02.640]  lady with the heimlich that time i got out of there because i don't want to
[02:10:02.640 --> 02:10:06.320]  sue me or something if she had a hurt rib i mean i i don't know if she had a
[02:10:06.320 --> 02:10:09.200]  hurt rib but i mean she was big i had to pick her up
[02:10:09.200 --> 02:10:12.320]  i mean that was like 12 years ago i don't know i could pick her up today i
[02:10:12.320 --> 02:10:15.920]  guess i'm strong as i was she probably weighed like 250 pounds
[02:10:15.920 --> 02:10:21.440]  uh but uh he broke up the fight all the witnesses have told the grand jury that
[02:10:21.440 --> 02:10:25.120]  that's been coming out we know the same witnesses that are in the grand jury
[02:10:25.120 --> 02:10:28.080]  have told the media that so i would suppose they've told the grand jury that
[02:10:28.080 --> 02:10:35.200]  that's all sealed and then the cops pull up and you know there's a big guy
[02:10:35.200 --> 02:10:38.800]  i was talking to this really big guy i know who's in some mic judge movies
[02:10:38.800 --> 02:10:42.960]  an actor and he was talking about how uh he's like six foot six like
[02:10:42.960 --> 02:10:46.800]  probably 300 pounds he's like his biggest Hulk Hogan but
[02:10:46.800 --> 02:10:51.120]  not all of its muscle and uh he was talking about yeah guys all the time in
[02:10:51.120 --> 02:10:54.480]  bars or anywhere just start a fight with him because he's big
[02:10:54.480 --> 02:10:59.120]  and so you got four cops that engage him a couple more that are there
[02:10:59.120 --> 02:11:02.960]  this whole task force of playing close cops with uniform cops
[02:11:02.960 --> 02:11:07.360]  and they just kill him and he's not resisting till they start hurting him
[02:11:07.360 --> 02:11:11.600]  and then it's a natural instinct hey
[02:11:11.600 --> 02:11:15.280]  hey you're hurting me hey i can't breathe and then he
[02:11:15.280 --> 02:11:18.400]  they sit on his arm and then say you know put your arm behind your back that
[02:11:18.400 --> 02:11:23.440]  stupid little game don't resist don't resist as they beat you
[02:11:23.440 --> 02:11:28.160]  and the system likes having murderers on the payroll they like having scary
[02:11:28.160 --> 02:11:31.840]  thugs in a lot of major cities and areas some departments don't want it and
[02:11:31.840 --> 02:11:35.520]  they're good departments you have to have zero tolerance for that
[02:11:35.520 --> 02:11:39.520]  uh i mean you need people that are tough in in my historical research
[02:11:39.520 --> 02:11:42.400]  if they're going to be police but you don't need people that want to show off
[02:11:42.400 --> 02:11:46.720]  and kill somebody because it's makes them feel good
[02:11:46.720 --> 02:11:49.440]  and
[02:11:49.520 --> 02:11:54.080]  they just walk right up to him tell him put his hands behind his back
[02:11:54.080 --> 02:11:57.520]  and he doesn't get three words out to try to talk to him
[02:11:57.520 --> 02:12:03.840]  before they grab him and kill him and then there's the other issue if people
[02:12:03.840 --> 02:12:08.000]  riot over this and criminals use social networks as an excuse to loot
[02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:13.280]  and i say the looters are bad it isn't endorsing the cops killing
[02:12:13.280 --> 02:12:16.240]  but then it comes down to the point that the grand jury doesn't indict at least
[02:12:16.240 --> 02:12:19.440]  the guy that choked him to death
[02:12:21.440 --> 02:12:24.400]  then the media will focus on people threatening the police families
[02:12:24.400 --> 02:12:29.920]  which isn't right but i'll tell you this let me tell you how justice works
[02:12:29.920 --> 02:12:36.000]  two wrongs don't make a right you know what'll happen
[02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:39.120]  you know the kelly thomas case very similar with it but they're taking like
[02:12:39.120 --> 02:12:42.960]  16 minutes to beat his brains out and choke him
[02:12:42.960 --> 02:12:46.080]  and they're sitting on every limb and and just keep saying don't resist don't
[02:12:46.080 --> 02:12:49.120]  resist getting off on it
[02:12:50.240 --> 02:12:52.720]  and you can see the excitement on the video and then they try to cover up the
[02:12:52.720 --> 02:12:57.280]  video but it got released and the cops got indicted but then the jury
[02:12:57.280 --> 02:13:02.560]  basically let him off sick of panic and the two cops that killed him were just
[02:13:02.560 --> 02:13:06.880]  total little demons they didn't charge other five or six that were
[02:13:06.880 --> 02:13:09.920]  sitting on him but the ones that beat his head in with the flashlight and
[02:13:09.920 --> 02:13:13.200]  broke his neck and the rest of it they had all these problems in their history
[02:13:13.200 --> 02:13:17.200]  in their past it's these thug types
[02:13:17.200 --> 02:13:20.880]  they look like people you'd see in like maximum security prison
[02:13:20.880 --> 02:13:24.000]  the two cops that killed kelly
[02:13:26.160 --> 02:13:31.840]  and he you know kelly's dad was a cop and basically the whole
[02:13:31.840 --> 02:13:36.400]  family are cops and i know so many police that have had their kids killed
[02:13:36.400 --> 02:13:40.800]  or falsely charged or put in prison by the system and that's the message
[02:13:40.800 --> 02:13:45.120]  i'll guarantee you that if they don't indict that officer
[02:13:45.120 --> 02:13:48.640]  it's just the way the universe works
[02:13:48.960 --> 02:13:52.560]  his kid's gonna die in a car wreck next year
[02:13:52.560 --> 02:13:57.440]  or he'll he'll get a brain tumor or it's just it's the way the universe works i'd
[02:13:57.440 --> 02:14:01.040]  bet you money kelly's dad
[02:14:01.040 --> 02:14:04.400]  kelly thomas's dad
[02:14:04.400 --> 02:14:07.120]  wasn't perfect
[02:14:07.360 --> 02:14:12.160]  and see that's what god fearing is i know in my spirit but also i've
[02:14:12.160 --> 02:14:15.280]  experienced it everything i ever did wrong came back on me a whole
[02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:17.600]  bunch
[02:14:18.240 --> 02:14:21.600]  and that's why if i was a cop i wouldn't start choking somebody unless they were
[02:14:21.600 --> 02:14:25.200]  really coming at me unless i thought i really needed to
[02:14:25.200 --> 02:14:28.080]  fight for my life
[02:14:28.080 --> 02:14:31.680]  because i don't want to kill somebody
[02:14:31.680 --> 02:14:34.400]  let me tell you something i was in a lot of fights growing up in dallas and a
[02:14:34.400 --> 02:14:38.640]  few times i hurt people really bad i mean in a comas and stuff
[02:14:38.640 --> 02:14:41.520]  and that's why i learned whoa i can't get in fights because somebody starts
[02:14:41.520 --> 02:14:44.320]  hurting me i hurt them bad i mean i just black out and
[02:14:44.320 --> 02:14:47.680]  next year's an ambulance people got blood coming out their noses and ears
[02:14:47.680 --> 02:14:49.920]  and
[02:14:50.480 --> 02:14:53.520]  i feel guilty
[02:14:53.520 --> 02:14:59.280]  25 years later
[02:14:59.520 --> 02:15:03.200]  for people that are mentally retarded because they got in a fight with me
[02:15:03.200 --> 02:15:05.600]  basically
[02:15:07.840 --> 02:15:11.440]  and so i know what i'm talking about i've been in fights with people started
[02:15:11.440 --> 02:15:15.360]  it and i was fighting and they were hurting me and so i hurt them bad
[02:15:15.360 --> 02:15:20.320]  and let me tell you i still feel bad for it so i know what i'm talking about
[02:15:20.320 --> 02:15:24.000]  and those cops murdered that man and you know what they've been trained they
[02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:29.360]  know what they're doing they killed him better than a hammer
[02:15:29.760 --> 02:15:32.800]  and you know what you weren't fighting for your life police i don't care if you
[02:15:32.800 --> 02:15:36.480]  claim he starts flailing when you're choking him any mammal will do that when
[02:15:36.480 --> 02:15:39.520]  it's being killed it's like telling a gazelle not to
[02:15:39.520 --> 02:15:44.080]  flop around when it's in the teeth of a lion
[02:15:45.600 --> 02:15:48.480]  in fact lions ought to you know if they could talk say
[02:15:48.480 --> 02:15:52.720]  don't resist when a gazelle's kicking and it's got its throat in its neck
[02:15:52.720 --> 02:15:56.880]  and its mouth let's go to the footage
[02:15:56.880 --> 02:15:59.920]  again for radio listeners i'll describe it but here it is
[02:15:59.920 --> 02:16:06.880]  of them killing eric garner
[02:16:06.880 --> 02:16:10.720]  so he's saying don't don't touch me he's trying to stand up for himself and
[02:16:10.720 --> 02:16:15.520]  talk to him he's got his hands up though and i guess just talking back to god
[02:16:15.520 --> 02:16:20.720]  gets you killed and now the guy wearing the 99 we've got his name here
[02:16:20.720 --> 02:16:24.640]  just barrels in full and then they shit on his head
[02:16:24.640 --> 02:16:28.480]  and say put your arm behind your back as they sit on it
[02:16:28.480 --> 02:16:33.120]  i can't breathe they love that back again police beating up on people
[02:16:33.120 --> 02:16:38.320]  back up right here back up and get on that stack okay back up
[02:16:38.320 --> 02:16:43.120]  all he did was break up a fight and this what happens for breaking up a fight
[02:16:43.120 --> 02:16:48.160]  this is crazy
[02:16:48.160 --> 02:16:51.920]  they always wait till they're dead and then they
[02:16:51.920 --> 02:16:55.040]  he's having seizures but they still sit on his head
[02:16:55.040 --> 02:16:57.600]  that's right when you're choking somebody they're having a seizure that's
[02:16:57.600 --> 02:17:00.480]  their brains dying
[02:17:01.120 --> 02:17:04.960]  look now i mean they gave this man a seizure no move out the way

[02:24:18.160 --> 02:24:23.040]  what about to say it's not a conspiracy theory it's admitted
[02:24:23.040 --> 02:24:28.400]  we did have guests on who broke down the coming energy war a few years ago not
[02:24:28.400 --> 02:24:33.120]  just pastor lindsay williams but others
[02:24:33.120 --> 02:24:36.160]  you probably have him back on because i remember him's distinctly talking about
[02:24:36.160 --> 02:24:39.440]  how they were going to drive down the oil prices have a huge oil boom here in the
[02:24:39.440 --> 02:24:43.280]  us but that was also known at the time as well
[02:24:43.280 --> 02:24:48.480]  but here's what's happening you see all this demonization of shale
[02:24:48.480 --> 02:24:52.560]  all this demonization of what they call fracking to get the natural gas and to
[02:24:52.560 --> 02:24:56.080]  get the oil and there are a lot of bad examples of
[02:24:56.080 --> 02:24:58.880]  fracking and there are companies that don't do it well
[02:24:58.880 --> 02:25:04.640]  that's true but almost all the funding against it
[02:25:04.640 --> 02:25:08.960]  is by the major oil companies and the sawties
[02:25:08.960 --> 02:25:13.200]  who have their own oil operations all over the world
[02:25:13.200 --> 02:25:16.560]  and they don't want wildcat american-based competition
[02:25:16.560 --> 02:25:20.480]  just like they don't want a pipeline out of canadian shale coming down to the
[02:25:20.480 --> 02:25:24.240]  refinery in corpus christi and they make it all a republican
[02:25:24.240 --> 02:25:26.000]  coke brothers they're they're they're they're they're
[02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:30.480]  i don't care who's doing what i want more oil i want free market
[02:25:30.480 --> 02:25:33.760]  the only reason you've got oil prices going down right now is that's russia's
[02:25:33.760 --> 02:25:38.000]  main economy they're a one crop economy
[02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:41.600]  it's basically all they've got is oil and gas supply europe
[02:25:41.600 --> 02:25:46.400]  and they continue to keep oil prices somewhat down
[02:25:46.400 --> 02:25:50.080]  when the west wanted to jack it up and really rip everybody off to 10 15 20
[02:25:50.080 --> 02:25:54.320]  dollars a gallon sky's the limit so they're going oh really
[02:25:54.320 --> 02:25:57.520]  russia you're gonna do that how about we lower it down to below
[02:25:57.520 --> 02:26:02.000]  40 a barrel and we'll still screw our people
[02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.640]  over it won't go down that much because we control the refineries and the
[02:26:04.640 --> 02:26:10.400]  bottleneck and we'll still you know lower gas prices some but not that much
[02:26:11.280 --> 02:26:15.200]  and then that'll also shut down the wildcats the smaller companies
[02:26:15.200 --> 02:26:18.880]  starting all these other facilities and and and building some of these boutique
[02:26:18.880 --> 02:26:22.880]  refineries but a lot of interesting things happening out there
[02:26:22.880 --> 02:26:26.240]  they only allowed ethanol which is very destructive in my view
[02:26:26.240 --> 02:26:30.320]  uh to the environment and and the crops and the and then you name it
[02:26:30.320 --> 02:26:35.360]  to also try to shut down uh wildcatting operations or small outfits
[02:26:35.360 --> 02:26:41.600]  exploring minerals mainly oil our last lead smelting plant
[02:26:41.760 --> 02:26:46.080]  me leads uses and basically everything was shut down by the feds this year
[02:26:46.080 --> 02:26:50.640]  it closed this year no bullets are now made in the u.s
[02:26:50.640 --> 02:26:54.000]  cartridges are loaded there's a lot of uh
[02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:58.560]  cartridges going on but but but the lead comes from other countries and is
[02:26:58.560 --> 02:27:02.000]  prepared in other countries they don't even let you form the lead here in the
[02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:05.120]  u.s the biggest economy in the world
[02:27:05.120 --> 02:27:11.120]  that's how controlled we are china has over 10 000 lead smelting facilities
[02:27:11.120 --> 02:27:14.320]  china opens three coal power plants a week we shut
[02:27:14.320 --> 02:27:18.160]  it was three a week a year ago now it's about 10 a week
[02:27:18.160 --> 02:27:21.040]  10 a week it's they're just flipping the lights off
[02:27:21.040 --> 02:27:25.040]  turning our power off i mean forget shipping your jobs overseas
[02:27:25.040 --> 02:27:28.560]  they're shutting down the power plants they won't
[02:27:28.560 --> 02:27:32.960]  they're shutting down gold mines all over the u.s
[02:27:32.960 --> 02:27:37.040]  do you understand that silver mines the bureaucrats come down on you like you
[02:27:37.040 --> 02:27:42.000]  know what like flies on you know what
[02:27:43.120 --> 02:27:49.760]  so the caller brings up the fact that there's a massive plunge in filings to
[02:27:49.760 --> 02:27:52.960]  drill that's what's been making the
[02:27:52.960 --> 02:27:57.600]  texas economy boom it's going to hurt the texas economy
[02:27:57.600 --> 02:28:03.920]  big time east texas south texas west texas only thing running its oil
[02:28:03.920 --> 02:28:07.520]  why do you think texas is a boom state everybody's moving here oil
[02:28:07.520 --> 02:28:10.800]  you turn the exploration of natural gas and oil off you've like flipping a
[02:28:10.800 --> 02:28:13.200]  switch
[02:28:15.360 --> 02:28:19.200]  who was i talking to brought that up i'm gonna go back to them
[02:28:19.520 --> 02:28:22.160]  oh they dropped off i was going to hold him over so he could finish this point
[02:28:22.160 --> 02:28:24.880]  yeah that's in zero hedge you're absolutely right
[02:28:24.880 --> 02:28:29.040]  and that's what this is all about the west with saudi arabia
[02:28:29.040 --> 02:28:32.640]  against the american people and against the russians
[02:28:32.640 --> 02:28:37.840]  they're against anybody having anything houston we have a problem
[02:28:37.840 --> 02:28:42.080]  with a third of the s and p capital expenditure
[02:28:42.080 --> 02:28:47.200]  due from the imploding energy sector and over 20 percent of the high yield
[02:28:47.200 --> 02:28:51.040]  market dominated by these names paying attention to
[02:28:51.040 --> 02:28:54.000]  an infection point in the u.s well producers is critical
[02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:56.960]  as they have been gung-ho unequivocally good
[02:28:56.960 --> 02:29:00.160]  expanders even as well prices have began to fall
[02:29:00.160 --> 02:29:04.640]  so when reuters reports a drop almost 40 and new well permits issued
[02:29:04.640 --> 02:29:07.520]  that that's right they're not issuing them i should add they're not just
[02:29:07.520 --> 02:29:10.240]  they're not getting them across the united states in november
[02:29:10.240 --> 02:29:13.840]  even the feds stan fisher might start questioning
[02:29:13.840 --> 02:29:17.440]  the lower oil prices are a phenomenon that's making everybody
[02:29:17.440 --> 02:29:26.240]  better off no it's not data provided exclusively to reuters
[02:29:26.240 --> 02:29:30.160]  on tuesday by industry data from drilling info ink
[02:29:30.160 --> 02:29:33.760]  showed 4,520 new well permits were approved last month
[02:29:33.760 --> 02:29:41.120]  down from 7,727 in october i mean you're seeing a major pullback response
[02:29:41.120 --> 02:29:44.480]  and i know folks like i don't know well why do i care
[02:29:44.480 --> 02:29:49.360]  we all live off of it it's the oxygen of the modern industrialization
[02:29:49.360 --> 02:29:55.040]  the empire is bad for the us jones and the china and india mexico can get as
[02:29:55.040 --> 02:29:58.720]  much as they want
[02:29:58.720 --> 02:30:02.320]  aging starts at the cellular level when cells become toxic
[02:30:02.320 --> 02:30:07.440]  they die early and aging sets in in the past decade we have witnessed
[02:30:07.440 --> 02:30:10.880]  unparalleled scientific discoveries during that period

[02:33:26.800 --> 02:33:33.840]  well daniel hantaleo nypd officer and eric garner show called death
[02:33:33.840 --> 02:33:38.640]  not indicted by statin island grand jury
[02:33:38.640 --> 02:33:44.640]  this is what's causing the problem he clearly is not resisting him and
[02:33:44.640 --> 02:33:48.960]  even if he did is that a death penalty there had been warnings earlier that a
[02:33:48.960 --> 02:33:52.160]  decision not to charge the officer who is
[02:33:52.160 --> 02:33:55.760]  white with a crime for killing a black man with fan tension so i've seen two
[02:33:55.760 --> 02:33:59.360]  cases this week a grand jury's not billin black cops who killed white
[02:33:59.360 --> 02:34:02.480]  people it it's just it's it's it's not about
[02:34:02.480 --> 02:34:04.880]  race so much this is about sycophantically
[02:34:04.880 --> 02:34:09.840]  defending what the police do period statin island was bracing for fergusson
[02:34:09.840 --> 02:34:13.600]  like trouble wednesday after a grand jury chose not to indict nypd
[02:34:13.600 --> 02:34:18.000]  officer for killing eric garner with a chokehold sources said
[02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:21.360]  there have been warnings earlier at the decision not to charge the officer
[02:34:21.360 --> 02:34:25.040]  who is white with a crime for killing a black man with fan tensions
[02:34:25.040 --> 02:34:29.760]  and as word of the panel's decision seeped into statin island neighborhoods
[02:34:29.760 --> 02:34:33.200]  where anti-police sentiment is strongest cops were on high alert
[02:34:33.200 --> 02:34:36.240]  and prepared for the worst
[02:34:36.960 --> 02:34:40.640]  yeah and innocent cops will end up getting killed over the anti-police
[02:34:40.640 --> 02:34:43.200]  sentiment that's why you see oakland a bunch of cops getting killed
[02:34:43.200 --> 02:34:47.040]  it's not going to go well the more you get militarized the more you attack the
[02:34:47.040 --> 02:34:51.120]  more you're gonna people are coming after you uh garner a 43 year old father
[02:34:51.120 --> 02:34:55.200]  of six was killed july 17th when the officer subdued him
[02:34:55.200 --> 02:34:59.680]  subdued him they got into anything on a street with a
[02:34:59.680 --> 02:35:03.280]  banned chokehold oh but it doesn't matter that you used
[02:35:03.280 --> 02:35:07.040]  what's known as the killer chokehold knew exactly what he was doing in my
[02:35:07.040 --> 02:35:10.480]  my opinion police said they approached garner because he was
[02:35:10.480 --> 02:35:14.080]  selling unlicensed cigarettes better known as lucy's
[02:35:14.080 --> 02:35:17.360]  and then he resisted arrest they noted that garner's
[02:35:17.360 --> 02:35:23.520]  rap sheet listed 31 arrests beginning when he was 16 it's all like petty stuff
[02:35:23.680 --> 02:35:26.480]  people said he was a good guy in the community and how are you supposed to
[02:35:26.480 --> 02:35:29.840]  make money i mean oh that's like having a lemonade stand or selling stuff on
[02:35:29.840 --> 02:35:33.680]  the street oh my gosh i remember when we used to go
[02:35:33.680 --> 02:35:36.080]  into the black part of town because liquor stores there would sell us beer
[02:35:36.080 --> 02:35:39.360]  when i was a teenager there was always guys out front selling cigarettes
[02:35:39.360 --> 02:35:43.760]  hey you want one cigarette you know but garner's death spark national outrage
[02:35:43.760 --> 02:35:48.000]  after the daily news obtained a sickening cell phone video of his
[02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:51.600]  deadly encounter with police yeah that didn't match what the cops had said i
[02:35:51.600 --> 02:35:54.000]  should add
[02:35:55.520 --> 02:35:59.280]  i mean the point is they're saying give me your arm as they're on top of him
[02:35:59.280 --> 02:36:02.400]  choking him and he can't get turned over because they've
[02:36:02.400 --> 02:36:06.160]  got him pinned the other way i mean it's just it's such a
[02:36:06.160 --> 02:36:10.160]  joke like the police just decide all right sit on him
[02:36:10.160 --> 02:36:15.520]  don't let and then say stop resisting just like the thomas kelly case
[02:36:15.520 --> 02:36:18.960]  i mean this isn't even as bad as that because at least they kill him quickly
[02:36:18.960 --> 02:36:24.240]  it didn't go on for 16 minutes of him begging for daddy
[02:36:27.680 --> 02:36:32.000]  and they're like put your arm behind your back
[02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:38.880]  and he can't do it because they're all sitting on him i mean it's just a joke
[02:36:38.880 --> 02:36:41.840]  well you know when you're in trouble when cops start saying don't resist
[02:36:41.840 --> 02:36:45.760]  so obviously the country's under great tyranny
[02:36:45.760 --> 02:36:52.240]  it's very very sad but when you think the police in some areas
[02:36:52.240 --> 02:36:58.000]  are out of control if you think that's bad what about foreign banks running the
[02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:01.280]  country and putting cancer viruses in the vaccines oh but when your kid goes
[02:37:01.280 --> 02:37:04.400]  in and gets a shot and has a convulsion and is autistic
[02:37:04.400 --> 02:37:08.320]  that's okay because they deny it and we don't know who's behind it and blah
[02:37:08.320 --> 02:37:10.880]  blah blah
[02:37:14.800 --> 02:37:18.400]  let's go ahead and uh go back to your phone calls we're gonna go to donna
[02:37:18.400 --> 02:37:24.240]  jim randall bob uh patin and others who's been holding the longest we're
[02:37:24.240 --> 02:37:28.720]  ranel and then patin ranel in new york thanks for calling
[02:37:28.720 --> 02:37:36.720]  hi alex hey thank you for calling okay first i want to talk about uh
[02:37:36.720 --> 02:37:44.400]  furgeston okay go ahead um but i think uh burning things down and
[02:37:44.400 --> 02:37:51.440]  shooting up police cars and all riding is really not the right thing to do
[02:37:51.440 --> 02:37:54.560]  no i hear you but i mean one of it just becomes customary
[02:37:54.560 --> 02:37:58.320]  if you ask a cop a question they shoot you because that's starting to happen
[02:37:58.320 --> 02:38:00.640]  um
[02:38:01.840 --> 02:38:09.920]  what do you think that's wrong it's it means we're under great tyranny
[02:38:09.920 --> 02:38:13.120]  yes it does what else you want to talk about brother um
[02:38:13.120 --> 02:38:21.200]  and and uh obama really is a liar because uh he
[02:38:21.200 --> 02:38:25.680]  he said he wasn't going to try to take our guns
[02:38:25.680 --> 02:38:31.120]  now this ties into guns which is what i one of the things i wanted to talk
[02:38:31.120 --> 02:38:34.240]  about i'm not screening your call go ahead
[02:38:34.240 --> 02:38:37.360]  okay people always call in and like say what they want to go ahead you're on
[02:38:37.360 --> 02:38:41.520]  here okay um he said he wouldn't come
[02:38:41.520 --> 02:38:44.720]  after our guns when every one of the bills is a gun
[02:38:44.720 --> 02:38:48.800]  confiscation yes total liar
[02:38:48.800 --> 02:38:55.040]  and uh you i i want to refer to a previous show i saw of you
[02:38:55.040 --> 02:38:58.800]  when you talked about the gun laws in in switzerland
[02:38:58.800 --> 02:39:07.120]  it's like you got to have a rifle in your house by law and if the police
[02:39:07.120 --> 02:39:10.080]  come and find your gun your guns you get you get
[02:39:10.080 --> 02:39:12.480]  fined
[02:39:13.280 --> 02:39:16.720]  yes that's for people that are a militia age but that goes up into your
[02:39:16.720 --> 02:39:20.560]  fifties and basically everybody else has guns and so the crime rate is
[02:39:20.560 --> 02:39:24.480]  incredibly uh low the lowest in the world because
[02:39:24.480 --> 02:39:28.880]  of that i appreciate your call let's talk to patent in fema region four
[02:39:28.880 --> 02:39:33.040]  what former state are you in listening on 94.3
[02:39:33.040 --> 02:39:38.400]  fm wnfz that can see that's right you're
[02:39:38.400 --> 02:39:44.080]  listening on kcxl go ahead i'm a rooster in the Knoxville area here
[02:39:44.080 --> 02:39:47.920]  and i was raised to believe that if you work hard
[02:39:47.920 --> 02:39:52.480]  and stay on track it'll pay off at some point
[02:39:52.480 --> 02:39:56.560]  well i just i know for a fact that for a political game
[02:39:56.560 --> 02:39:59.920]  it feels like he just signed a wave my hope for a future
[02:39:59.920 --> 02:40:07.280]  financially at least so how do we get somebody like
[02:40:07.280 --> 02:40:12.320]  venturi in there if they won't let him in the debates
[02:40:12.320 --> 02:40:15.920]  well i like jesse because i know him well and i know he's for real
[02:40:15.920 --> 02:40:19.120]  and he really believes what he's saying and doing it doesn't even mean i
[02:40:19.120 --> 02:40:23.120]  agree with a lot of the policies and things that he promotes
[02:40:23.120 --> 02:40:27.920]  i think we always end up focusing on a president to save us
[02:40:27.920 --> 02:40:30.720]  or to fix things i think it's gonna have to be us taking back the counties and
[02:40:30.720 --> 02:40:35.600]  cities and just blocking at every level what the feds try to do because the feds
[02:40:35.600 --> 02:40:38.880]  have essentially been captured by foreign interest
[02:40:38.880 --> 02:40:45.840]  but obama operating as a dictator which he's doing and the republican
[02:40:45.840 --> 02:40:50.720]  leadership not bucking it and bowing within a few hours of obama's
[02:40:50.720 --> 02:40:54.880]  executive order is illustrative of just how much
[02:40:54.880 --> 02:40:58.960]  trouble we're in patent right i also wanted to quote
[02:40:58.960 --> 02:41:03.920]  george washington if we don't stand together we will hang separate
[02:41:03.920 --> 02:41:07.760]  that's right brother good to hear from you all right let's go another caller
[02:41:07.760 --> 02:41:14.240]  jim in olympia you're on the air welcome yes um thank you alex um i'm an over
[02:41:14.240 --> 02:41:17.840]  the road trucker also from not still tennessee
[02:41:17.840 --> 02:41:23.600]  and uh i was on long polls campaign staff in 08 and 2012
[02:41:23.600 --> 02:41:27.200]  and i'm an as an oath keeper i want to encourage all fellow
[02:41:27.200 --> 02:41:30.800]  info warriors if i may to go to oath keepers dot
[02:41:30.800 --> 02:41:35.440]  com or dot org and learn about the community preservation team
[02:41:35.440 --> 02:41:39.840]  basically what the oath keepers were doing and are doing according to steward
[02:41:39.840 --> 02:41:42.960]  still according to steward roads is that they're
[02:41:42.960 --> 02:41:46.960]  activating community preservation teams there by protecting those four
[02:41:46.960 --> 02:41:50.320]  businesses that remain on and the businesses have asked for them to be
[02:41:50.320 --> 02:41:53.680]  there we have articles on info wars dot com detailing that and the police have
[02:41:53.680 --> 02:41:57.600]  come outside of law saying you need a license to be here
[02:41:57.600 --> 02:42:02.000]  if you were a security firm you do but my license is the second amendment
[02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:05.120]  and free association in a private business owner
[02:42:05.120 --> 02:42:08.960]  wants to have me in his business helping him secure his home
[02:42:08.960 --> 02:42:14.160]  that is my right to do it and the police are engaged in basically martial law
[02:42:14.160 --> 02:42:18.240]  but notice the ultimate crime is citizens protecting themselves
[02:42:18.240 --> 02:42:22.400]  it's all a big power grab and the government wants the police to have
[02:42:22.400 --> 02:42:27.040]  the right to kill citizens with impunity but then it makes the police state
[02:42:27.040 --> 02:42:30.160]  look good to set them against a bunch of hood rats
[02:42:30.160 --> 02:42:33.440]  beating people's brains out with hammers uh so
[02:42:33.440 --> 02:42:37.920]  we've got a problem on both fronts but just attacking the police
[02:42:37.920 --> 02:42:45.120]  will be a self-fulfilling prophecy to then ensure the civil war
[02:42:45.120 --> 02:42:49.360]  amen just by the way i was with you in shantilly as an
[02:42:49.360 --> 02:42:52.880]  oathkeeper supporting you and your leadership and i just do want to
[02:42:52.880 --> 02:42:56.880]  encourage people to learn about the community cpt's community preservation
[02:42:56.880 --> 02:43:00.720]  teams at oathkeepers.org and i've got two quick questions
[02:43:00.720 --> 02:43:08.160]  about um let's see what what are you having a balance
[02:43:08.160 --> 02:43:12.320]  being uh you know a terrible first amendment guy which you're helping us
[02:43:12.320 --> 02:43:16.400]  all to be with security of your family when they both
[02:43:16.400 --> 02:43:20.160]  kind of work against each other and two what do you think is going to happen
[02:43:20.160 --> 02:43:23.280]  with uh the other jessie uh jessie benton of the
[02:43:23.280 --> 02:43:27.360]  compromiser who has conucky kentucky connections with rand poll
[02:43:27.360 --> 02:43:31.600]  and mcconnell what's he going to do in this coming election
[02:43:31.600 --> 02:43:34.960]  yeah i don't i don't really like jessie benton i'll just leave it at that but
[02:43:34.960 --> 02:43:38.800]  i mean compared to like hillary clinton or something i really i think it's
[02:43:38.800 --> 02:43:42.880]  i think it's kind of inside baseball to get into people like jessie benton
[02:43:42.880 --> 02:43:46.720]  uh who's worked for rand poll and then for rand poll and
[02:43:46.720 --> 02:43:51.520]  i've known him pretty good over the years but uh he's just
[02:43:51.520 --> 02:43:55.760]  he's just a big compromiser and um
[02:43:55.760 --> 02:43:59.680]  i don't think he's that smart i mean i'm not against people that have speech
[02:43:59.680 --> 02:44:03.120]  impediments i love people that have speech impediments they're smart but uh
[02:44:03.120 --> 02:44:06.800]  he's just annoying but i i don't think that really matters i shouldn't even
[02:44:06.800 --> 02:44:11.920]  make comments about jessie benton uh it's just he is a piece of work
[02:44:11.920 --> 02:44:14.960]  i mean that's all i can say and if you like mitch mcconnell you like john
[02:44:14.960 --> 02:44:18.800]  banner you'll love jessie benton i appreciate your call
[02:44:18.800 --> 02:44:21.920]  yeah the oathkeepers is a great organization great people i've been
[02:44:21.920 --> 02:44:25.680]  supporting it since it started sure it roads have been having certain roads
[02:44:25.680 --> 02:44:29.120]  on constitutional lawyer before he started oathkeepers uh he formally
[02:44:29.120 --> 02:44:33.040]  worked with ron paul's a great guy um and i think what they're doing is
[02:44:33.040 --> 02:44:37.680]  wonderful and the militia is constitutional but
[02:44:37.680 --> 02:44:43.360]  the system has demonized that so really oathkeepers are just a modern
[02:44:43.360 --> 02:44:47.680]  militia that's made up of better trained police and military
[02:44:47.680 --> 02:44:51.840]  former or current and all you're saying is i'll keep my oath oh my gosh how
[02:44:51.840 --> 02:44:57.360]  dirty how evil how scary how bad so oathkeepers is made up of some of the
[02:44:57.360 --> 02:45:01.120]  best people out there and the name's great too
[02:45:01.120 --> 02:45:04.560]  you know skirts constitutional lawyer we should probably get him back on soon
[02:45:04.560 --> 02:45:10.640]  let's go ahead and talk to donna in louisiana donna you're on the air
[02:45:10.640 --> 02:45:17.040]  hi elix hey donna just wanted you to know my uh two sons one is 22 and one is
[02:45:17.040 --> 02:45:21.680]  20 and they have been avid listeners of yours since they were in high school
[02:45:21.680 --> 02:45:26.480]  wow well that's awesome yep um i got a couple of things
[02:45:26.480 --> 02:45:29.520]  number one you're talking about the guillotines on the
[02:45:29.520 --> 02:45:35.840]  military basis i um am a desert storm veteran i was stationed at belchase
[02:45:35.840 --> 02:45:44.240]  louisiana from 1988 or 87 until 1992 when daniel was
[02:45:44.240 --> 02:45:49.760]  born my oldest son and um when i was there i had found
[02:45:49.760 --> 02:45:55.520]  a room and a lot of um antique medical equipment
[02:45:55.520 --> 02:45:59.360]  in a storage room that we didn't even know was there at the air station
[02:45:59.360 --> 02:46:03.600]  and i had to send all that information all that uh
[02:46:03.600 --> 02:46:08.160]  all that equipment to uh the smithsonian and march into dc because of
[02:46:08.160 --> 02:46:11.920]  historical artifacts and so i had to fill out a thing
[02:46:11.920 --> 02:46:16.480]  well just so happen the invoice that i that i had to add my
[02:46:16.480 --> 02:46:22.560]  antique too was an invoice that included guillotines that were being shipped
[02:46:22.560 --> 02:46:26.160]  back from the middle east that were confiscated from saddam
[02:46:26.160 --> 02:46:30.480]  and those were also being sent to dc at that time
[02:46:30.480 --> 02:46:36.560]  wait a minute you you you saw this i saw this yes personally and i'm probably
[02:46:36.560 --> 02:46:39.920]  not supposed to talk about it but at this point who cares okay well listen a
[02:46:39.920 --> 02:46:43.120]  lot of times rumors have an original truth like people say there's rumors
[02:46:43.120 --> 02:46:45.920]  there's femicamps well they don't call them femicamps they call them
[02:46:45.920 --> 02:46:49.280]  emergency centers establishment act that's what it's called
[02:46:49.280 --> 02:46:53.440]  they're called emergency regional centers there there's civilian inmate labor
[02:46:53.440 --> 02:46:56.880]  camp program there's a plans for civil
[02:46:56.880 --> 02:47:00.560]  unrest there's a bunch of public documents they're real but they can play
[02:47:00.560 --> 02:47:03.680]  games and go we found no document with femicamp on it
[02:47:03.680 --> 02:47:07.280]  so i'd like to get your name and number off record if you want to go public with
[02:47:07.280 --> 02:47:10.720]  your name and stuff that's fine but we would uh love to put you on the nightly
[02:47:10.720 --> 02:47:13.920]  news or have you back on when you document
[02:47:13.920 --> 02:47:17.680]  you know who you are and what you're saying uh doesn't have to be public we
[02:47:17.680 --> 02:47:21.200]  just have to document who you are and and confirm it and that you were where
[02:47:21.200 --> 02:47:24.640]  you said you were just some basic records and then we would love to do an
[02:47:24.640 --> 02:47:28.560]  interview about confirmed guillotines so let me give you the floor for a few
[02:47:28.560 --> 02:47:32.000]  minutes though this is unconfirmed folks but you sound legitimate
[02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:37.040]  tell us slowly where you were and what you saw i was stationed at the naval
[02:47:37.040 --> 02:47:41.120]  air station bellchase and bellchase holy dana down at
[02:47:41.120 --> 02:47:44.560]  plackland parish i was raised here in northeast
[02:47:44.560 --> 02:47:48.960]  oceania and you know that you know i'm from here
[02:47:48.960 --> 02:47:52.800]  originally and of all things when i get stationed you know
[02:47:52.800 --> 02:47:55.760]  activity in the in the navy i end up down in new
[02:47:55.760 --> 02:47:58.800]  orange which was fine by me my husband and i were
[02:47:58.800 --> 02:48:01.920]  uh well i actually married my husband while i was there and everything and we
[02:48:01.920 --> 02:48:05.360]  lived there together for three years but i was there a total of five
[02:48:05.360 --> 02:48:10.880]  um armly discharge veteran of uh ten years from the u.s navy i was in the
[02:48:10.880 --> 02:48:14.640]  reserves first and then i went active duty i kind of did it backwards
[02:48:14.640 --> 02:48:19.600]  and um but i was actually uh in the military for ten years
[02:48:19.600 --> 02:48:24.560]  like i said honorably discharged veteran officially of a foreign war i did not
[02:48:24.560 --> 02:48:28.320]  go overseas because the ground war did not
[02:48:28.320 --> 02:48:34.080]  escalate in desert and i understand so specifically tell us about the guillotines
[02:48:34.080 --> 02:48:43.280]  okay i um received a invoice that and i was told to add the um
[02:48:43.280 --> 02:48:46.800]  artifacts that i had come across in the medical clinic
[02:48:46.800 --> 02:48:49.920]  to the invoice because all this was going to be shipped
[02:48:49.920 --> 02:48:54.800]  apparently there was a ship that had come in there at avondale i guess
[02:48:54.800 --> 02:49:00.560]  and it had these uh products on it that had come from the middle east and it
[02:49:00.560 --> 02:49:06.240]  was five guillotines and i was like oh my god but then um
[02:49:06.240 --> 02:49:09.120]  you know there was a little excerpt from it because it was going to the
[02:49:09.120 --> 02:49:15.600]  snisonian as well as my information you know as well that is who hoards all the
[02:49:15.600 --> 02:49:21.600]  of strange oddities that get hauled back uh so that that this may be the source
[02:49:21.600 --> 02:49:25.840]  then of the guillotine rumors that i've been hearing about since i was first on
[02:49:25.840 --> 02:49:32.240]  air in 1995 and it's it's always a truck crash they were in a
[02:49:32.240 --> 02:49:35.040]  military base there was a truckload of guillotines and
[02:49:35.040 --> 02:49:38.720]  i'm in michigan and my cousin's brother knows somebody that saw the truck of
[02:49:38.720 --> 02:49:44.240]  guillotines and martial law signs but you're the first person i've talked to
[02:49:44.240 --> 02:49:47.280]  i seem to remember 60 minutes or something talking about saddam and
[02:49:47.280 --> 02:49:50.000]  guillotines i know that's how they killed people over there
[02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:53.520]  like iraq would do it with a guillotine in syria they use a sword

[02:57:05.520 --> 02:57:09.360]  ahead thanks for holding well hey how's it going
[02:57:09.360 --> 02:57:12.880]  good brother i trained i trained and crawled my god i was watching that video
[02:57:12.880 --> 02:57:18.480]  that guy in the green shirt number 99 when he when he was choking that guy
[02:57:18.480 --> 02:57:22.640]  that was like a triangle choke and basically he had his arm pinned
[02:57:22.640 --> 02:57:27.520]  you can't breathe and you cannot talk and they got one arm behind the guy's back
[02:57:27.520 --> 02:57:31.120]  so when they're saying you know stop resisting don't you know the guy can't
[02:57:31.120 --> 02:57:34.000]  even talk well that's it i don't train in mma i don't
[02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:37.760]  train and crawl McGraw but i know wrestling and i've read about it and
[02:57:37.760 --> 02:57:42.960]  you can see they pin him at a move and killing and that's why it's so
[02:57:42.960 --> 02:57:46.560]  evil that they killed him i mean it's it's great and they're saying put your
[02:57:46.560 --> 02:57:50.000]  arm behind your back that's their excuse to keep choking when they've got an
[02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:54.480]  illegal kill choke correct i mean is that not premeditated
[02:57:54.480 --> 02:57:57.760]  that that choke right there when you train with that in class you have to be
[02:57:57.760 --> 02:58:00.880]  so careful because if you don't tap out within a couple
[02:58:00.880 --> 02:58:04.320]  seconds you're going out like a light and that's why even in mma you've got a
[02:58:04.320 --> 02:58:08.400]  referee watching and they're watching you when that choke's applied it only
[02:58:08.400 --> 02:58:13.120]  takes a couple seconds this lights out and then they keep doing it and he's
[02:58:13.120 --> 02:58:16.800]  having a convulsion and they keep giving orders
[02:58:16.800 --> 02:58:21.120]  exactly i mean there's no way that guy he was he was screwed there was nothing
[02:58:21.120 --> 02:58:24.160]  he could do
[02:58:24.160 --> 02:58:27.600]  i know i'm not even you know i should get an expert in mma or
[02:58:27.600 --> 02:58:31.200]  that type stuff on it and simulate it and show it with like
[02:58:31.200 --> 02:58:35.120]  you know some of the guys just he's not going to get in trouble
[02:58:35.120 --> 02:58:38.560]  he's just i just cannot believe it i just cannot he was
[02:58:38.560 --> 02:58:42.240]  grand jury said you know great job we'll be right back some overdrive i'm

[03:00:20.160 --> 03:00:26.240]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[03:00:26.240 --> 03:00:31.520]  a government plot against the second amendment supporters fox news reports
[03:00:31.520 --> 03:00:35.040]  on the allen comb show former police chief mark kessler who's been on this
[03:00:35.040 --> 03:00:38.640]  show before and i thought something was suspicious about him at the time after
[03:00:38.640 --> 03:00:42.400]  interviewing or reposting an interview at info wars dot com
[03:00:42.400 --> 03:00:45.360]  made one of the most shocking revelations allen never heard
[03:00:45.360 --> 03:00:48.720]  and kessler said he was exposing it the first time
[03:00:48.720 --> 03:00:53.600]  he said he really worked for the feds to luring terrorist
[03:00:53.600 --> 03:00:57.040]  right-wingers and that they foiled terror attacks he ain't never heard about
[03:00:57.040 --> 03:01:01.440]  it that's made up in my view and then and then he really what he was doing is
[03:01:01.440 --> 03:01:05.600]  like cast sunstein type cognitive infiltration to demonize the second
[03:01:05.600 --> 03:01:10.720]  amendment that was his real mission in my view i'm gonna try to get him on
[03:01:10.720 --> 03:01:14.480]  but pretty ridiculous that kind of stuff's going on
[03:01:14.480 --> 03:01:20.320]  uh katie in femur region six what former state are you in

[03:02:40.000 --> 03:02:43.680]  which was everything one shooter just any other but when our husband gave his
[03:02:43.680 --> 03:02:46.960]  testimony he said there was multiple shooters in there he
[03:02:46.960 --> 03:02:49.920]  could tell they were in the front or the back of him
[03:02:49.920 --> 03:02:54.080]  and she grabbed his leg like you said too much you have to see the video
[03:02:54.080 --> 03:02:58.000]  because i showed it to my wife i said look at this lady grab her husband's leg

[03:03:03.840 --> 03:03:07.440]  his leg now looks at him like he says way too much
[03:03:07.440 --> 03:03:13.360]  wow you have to see the video ricky lake show it was the 21st of 2013 january
[03:03:13.360 --> 03:03:16.480]  well do me a favor find the clip somebody and send it to show tips
[03:03:16.480 --> 03:03:20.640]  and info wars dot com go good to hear from you i appreciate you calling in
[03:03:20.640 --> 03:03:25.440]  uh david in new york you're on the air go ahead
[03:03:25.440 --> 03:03:29.360]  alex say a long time listener um alex i'm an attorney
[03:03:29.360 --> 03:03:32.640]  i've got a a defending a man against murder
[03:03:32.640 --> 03:03:36.480]  he was defending himself with a shotgun after really extorting
[03:03:36.480 --> 03:03:41.520]  efforts to help the cops and now with all this fog of refusal to really look
[03:03:41.520 --> 03:03:45.280]  at what happened in these shootings it just makes it harder
[03:03:45.280 --> 03:03:49.120]  to do these cases and get them right because now supposedly
[03:03:49.120 --> 03:03:54.000]  uh trying to stop being an end trying to avoid being an enemy of the police
[03:03:54.000 --> 03:03:57.600]  gets uh makes you an opponent of people who are
[03:03:57.600 --> 03:04:01.200]  trying to fight racism well yeah no it's an us against them and tell they're
[03:04:01.200 --> 03:04:06.240]  trying to make us choose sides instead of just choosing justice
[03:04:06.240 --> 03:04:11.440]  and it's not justice to burn down grocery stores and stuff because you think a
[03:04:11.440 --> 03:04:15.760]  racist white cop killed somebody and it's not justice for a grand jury to
[03:04:15.760 --> 03:04:19.520]  no bill a cop that clearly chokes a guy to death i mean
[03:04:19.520 --> 03:04:22.640]  it's just amazing and i wonder what's going to happen in new york now
[03:04:22.640 --> 03:04:29.280]  in statin island with this situation uh i i i would have to say at least there's
[03:04:29.280 --> 03:04:32.960]  some science for that case it doesn't seem like the people who
[03:04:32.960 --> 03:04:35.440]  were picking these fights ever picked the right ones
[03:04:35.440 --> 03:04:39.440]  because then folks like us wouldn't be able to be supporters and i don't think
[03:04:39.440 --> 03:04:42.240]  they want supporters
[03:04:42.800 --> 03:04:46.400]  i hear you i just want to have justice in a good country but i tell you there's
[03:04:46.400 --> 03:04:49.760]  just so much evil out there god bless you sorry the other callers
[03:04:49.760 --> 03:04:52.800]  katrina and others i'll get to you if you call back tomorrow great job with the
[03:04:52.800 --> 03:04:59.520]  crew nightly news tonight seven o'clock central
