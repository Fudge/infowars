[00:00.000 --> 00:08.000]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[00:08.000 --> 00:22.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:22.000 --> 00:29.000]  The Info Wars Media Operation was the first organization, if you go back more than a decade ago, to detail,
[00:29.000 --> 00:38.000]  the Globalist Plan to bring in a world financial meltdown based in and around derivatives
[00:38.000 --> 00:47.000]  and a coming currency war on the backs of which they would then sell a rescue plan
[00:47.000 --> 00:54.000]  that would cement a global government. And that is now the point that we are reaching
[00:54.000 --> 01:02.000]  as a society, as a culture, as a world. Just yesterday, we reared a piece I did about a month and a half ago,
[01:02.000 --> 01:09.000]  headline Total Emergency Alert, Elites Evacuating Western Countries.
[01:09.000 --> 01:21.000]  And then I went over mainstream news articles saying that. But still we hear, oh, Alex Jones is a fear porn dealer.
[01:21.000 --> 01:31.000]  Alex Jones is a scaremonger. You know, I wish I was, and I wish I was wrong about all this.
[01:31.000 --> 01:39.000]  Because when the derivatives bubble goes belly up, when the currency devaluation bubble goes belly up,
[01:39.000 --> 01:47.000]  when the deflationary spiral starts sandwiched in with currency devaluation,
[01:47.000 --> 01:54.000]  we're going to have the perfect storm of the money being worthless,
[01:54.000 --> 01:59.000]  and they're not being jobs or an economy.
[01:59.000 --> 02:05.000]  And you're not supposed to be able to have that economically under free market systems,
[02:05.000 --> 02:12.000]  but when you have rigged systems and mega banks that charge you to keep money in the bank and charge you for transactions,
[02:12.000 --> 02:17.000]  while they push a cashless society to force you into their system,
[02:17.000 --> 02:24.000]  and then they themselves get free money at zero or negative interest, but then charge us interest,
[02:24.000 --> 02:28.000]  that is a rigged playing field.
[02:28.000 --> 02:37.000]  Microcosm of that is more than 10,000 nonprofit statuses issued in the last six and a half years by Obama
[02:37.000 --> 02:42.000]  to Democrats, Socialists, Communists, Nambla, you name it.
[02:42.000 --> 02:48.000]  In the last three years, one conservative group has been given a tax exemption.
[02:48.000 --> 02:51.000]  You say, what's it have to do with the economy?
[02:51.000 --> 02:57.000]  It's how everything is. Libor, the currency markets, the interest rates, the stock market.
[02:57.000 --> 03:04.000]  There is rigged as the dirtiest Atlantic City casino.
[03:04.000 --> 03:14.000]  In fact, I mean this when I say it, you got better odds making money in a Las Vegas or Atlantic City casino
[03:14.000 --> 03:21.000]  than you've got long term in this system.
[03:21.000 --> 03:27.000]  And they only gave us all this free money to get us addicted like heroin dealers or cocaine dealers
[03:27.000 --> 03:33.000]  handing out free samples to 12 year olds or 10 year olds at the local park.
[03:33.000 --> 03:38.000]  Now there's a reason crack dealers will give your 14 year old daughter some free crack
[03:38.000 --> 03:44.000]  because in a month they're going to have her on the street in another city working for them turning 10 tricks a day.
[03:44.000 --> 03:53.000]  And that's now the cycle where America is going from getting the free crack to being put out on the street.
[03:53.000 --> 04:03.000]  It is a pimp game, a fascinating world to quote Idiocracy and Mike Judge.
[04:03.000 --> 04:09.000]  So when we return, China royals markets for second day as Yon tumbles with stocks.
[04:09.000 --> 04:17.000]  Gold and silver surge is dollar dumps. 12 signs of an imminent global financial crash has become even more likely.
[04:17.000 --> 04:22.000]  These are mainstream headlines. People are like, wait, I've heard this before somewhere.
[04:22.000 --> 04:29.000]  You heard it here. You think I want to go up against these people? You think I want all this to happen?
[04:29.000 --> 04:35.000]  I'm doubled down, folks. I own a house. I'm invested here. I got roots here.
[04:35.000 --> 04:43.000]  I'm trying to stop this from happening. I'm trying to stop this from happening.
[04:43.000 --> 04:47.000]  But the only way to stop it is admitting what's coming before it gets here.
[04:47.000 --> 04:54.000]  They don't want people to know till the hammers drop so they can come out with their fake solution and pose like they're the saviors.
[04:54.000 --> 05:01.000]  Well, the EPA has done it again. Over the weekend, the group that secretly experimented on people by making them breathe diesel exhausts
[05:01.000 --> 05:06.000]  and the group that is finding people all over the country for the amount of smoke that leaves their chimneys spilt
[05:06.000 --> 05:10.000]  an estimated one million gallons of hazardous wastewater into the Animas River.
[05:10.000 --> 05:17.000]  According to the EPA, the spill occurred when one of its teams was using heavy equipment to enter the Gold King Mine, a suspended mine near Durango.
[05:17.000 --> 05:22.000]  Instead of entering the mine and beginning the process of pumping and treating the contaminated water inside his plan,
[05:22.000 --> 05:26.000]  the team accidentally caused it to flow into the nearby Animas River.
[05:26.000 --> 05:32.000]  Officials said they believe the spill carried heavy metals, mainly iron, zinc, and copper from the mine into the creek that feeds into the Animas River.
[05:32.000 --> 05:36.000]  You can see pictures all over the internet of orange water throughout the river.
[05:36.000 --> 05:41.000]  And local residents are concerned that fish and plants near the river are going to be dying en masse.
[05:41.000 --> 05:46.000]  The EPA also wants to cut out coal power burning plants which provide cheap power for the United States.
[05:46.000 --> 06:07.000]  Thanks, EPA, for all that you do. Rob Dew reporting for Infowars.com and Infowars Nightly News.

[06:46.000 --> 06:50.000]  Allege Jones here with a very important news alert for Infowars listeners.
[06:50.000 --> 06:56.000]  We've confirmed through our major suppliers attempting to resupply Survival Shield X-2 Deep Earth Crystals
[06:56.000 --> 07:00.000]  that elite corporations are buying up the supplies all over the world.
[07:00.000 --> 07:03.000]  So prices are going up and it's very hard to secure it.
[07:03.000 --> 07:08.000]  We have been able to secure a limited supply of the pure Deep Earth Crystals.
[07:08.000 --> 07:17.000]  And have now been able to produce more Survival Shield Nacin iodine X-2.
[07:17.000 --> 07:22.000]  This is the good halogen. This is the opposite of the bad halogens like fluoride.
[07:22.000 --> 07:31.000]  Now we at InfowarsLife.com are bringing you the only source of clean pure 99.99 ultra pure Deep Earth Crystals
[07:31.000 --> 07:34.000]  from more than 7000 feet below the Earth's surface.
[07:34.000 --> 07:42.000]  Watch the informational videos at InfowarsLife.com. Discover how transformational pure iodine can be for you and your family.
[07:42.000 --> 08:06.000]  Folks, this hidden hype. Read the reviews for yourself at InfowarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[08:06.000 --> 08:13.000]  And so move it on over. Move it on over. Move it on over. Move it on over.
[08:13.000 --> 08:16.000]  Little dog calls the big dogs moving in.
[08:16.000 --> 08:25.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[08:25.000 --> 08:36.000]  Move it on over. Scoot it on over. Move it on over. Move over skinny dog calls the fat dogs moving in.
[08:36.000 --> 08:44.000]  This dog house here is mighty small, but it's better than the old house that also eats it on over. Move it on over.
[08:44.000 --> 08:51.000]  Drag it on over. Move it on over. Move over old dog calls our new dogs moving in.
[08:51.000 --> 08:58.000]  And to build a world government run by private corporate interests that are above the law, they've got to bring down the old system.
[08:58.000 --> 09:07.000]  But while they do that, they max out the credit, they run the old system in the ground, and they blame the collapse on what made the old system great.
[09:07.000 --> 09:15.000]  Capitalism. When what we have today is engineered corporate crony fascism.
[09:15.000 --> 09:23.000]  Congressman Walter Jones will be joining us. He's spearheading, of course, the declassification of the 28 pages, but he's read it.
[09:23.000 --> 09:30.000]  So as Senator Graham and they say it clearly shows Saudi Arabia carried out the attacks, NORAD was ordered to stand down.
[09:30.000 --> 09:48.000]  9-11 wasn't inside job. And that ties in to USX intelligence chief, the former head of defense intelligence, says on ISIS's rise, it was a willful Washington decision and an order that the Pentagon did not agree with.
[09:48.000 --> 09:56.000]  We told you this two and a half years ago when the Pentagon said no to the air bombardment, which is very rare. They just said, we're not going to follow illegal orders.
[09:56.000 --> 10:03.000]  And now that's come out in released DIA reports, US may willful decision to support ISIS Syria.
[10:03.000 --> 10:16.000]  We have the video of this coming up. What did Jeb Bush come out and do in a speech he gave that CNN aired last night? Jeb Bush blames Clinton Obama for Iraq problems.
[10:16.000 --> 10:18.000]  They're all in on it.
[10:18.000 --> 10:26.000]  So it's one hand blaming the other hand, the right hand blaming the left hand. And then he goes into how we need to take out Assad to stop ISIS.
[10:26.000 --> 10:35.000]  Now, I predicted this would happen. Assad's battling ISIS. The West has been funding al-Qaeda, al-Nusra slash ISIS for five years.
[10:35.000 --> 10:43.000]  They think we're so dumb, they're now saying bombard Assad and that will take out ISIS.
[10:43.000 --> 10:48.000]  That's like saying kill Superman and Lex Luthor will die.
[10:48.000 --> 11:01.000]  Or, I mean, it's just, it's saying Christ is the devil. It's saying black is white, up is down, left is right.
[11:01.000 --> 11:14.000]  It's just a total insult to everyone's intelligence. But when you realize the general public cannot even find the Middle East on a map in national surveys.
[11:14.000 --> 11:20.000]  And they think Sunni is Shiite and they think Saddam carried out 9-11.
[11:20.000 --> 11:29.000]  He can get up there when we've ganged up on Assad and his people and the Christians and the non radical Muslims for five years and killed 300,000 of them.
[11:29.000 --> 11:38.000]  And their tiny military with Russian backing has been valiantly fighting the entire Saudi Arabian jihad.
[11:38.000 --> 11:47.000]  And now the answer is to bomb the Syrian army.
[11:47.000 --> 11:54.000]  And now the airstrikes are beginning against U.S. trained rebels who are really ISIS.
[11:54.000 --> 12:03.000]  They've got the F-18 joint strike fighter beginning its attacks.
[12:03.000 --> 12:10.000]  To fight ISIS, they're going to bomb Assad. Who's fighting ISIS?
[12:10.000 --> 12:18.000]  That'd be like having a top general say General Green in the war for independence in 1778 say,
[12:18.000 --> 12:24.000]  get up at a podium while George Washington's addressing troops and shoot George Washington in the back of the head and say,
[12:24.000 --> 12:32.000]  I did that to help the cause of liberty against the corrupt crown. I've shot George Washington in the head.
[12:32.000 --> 12:37.000]  That's how dumb they think we are. And you know what? We are that dumb.
[12:37.000 --> 12:48.000]  They put hydrofluorosilic acid in the water that they've known for 150 years, eats holes in your brain, gives you bone cancer and destroys fertility and makes you servile.
[12:48.000 --> 12:54.000]  They put that in the water and they put it in the food up to 600 parts per million.
[12:54.000 --> 13:00.000]  1.6 part per million will lower IQ by more than 10 points if you drink it for just a few years.
[13:00.000 --> 13:09.000]  That's a Harvard report. Do you know what 600 parts per million does in bread powder, the powder on bread, processed bread, powdered eggs?
[13:09.000 --> 13:14.000]  Do you know what 600 parts per million does? It's devastating.
[13:14.000 --> 13:20.000]  I remember being a kid at camp and I'd eat powdered eggs and have to go take a nap or throw it up.
[13:20.000 --> 13:27.000]  Nobody told me it had fluoride in it. I just knew I felt like I'd been run over by a truck.
[13:27.000 --> 13:32.000]  And it's all a big, sick joke to put roach poison in your food.
[13:32.000 --> 13:41.000]  So of course they're selling baby parts. Of course they put roach poison in most of the processed food.
[13:41.000 --> 13:55.000]  But let me tell you, we're having victories. Two years ago, the FDA under lawsuits and their own scientists saying it's deadly, said ban fluoride as a food additive and remove it.
[13:55.000 --> 14:00.000]  And cut it out of the water 50% as a face-saving event.
[14:00.000 --> 14:07.000]  So I got all this news. I got tons of news here. New stack to the rafters. All of it over the top, important.
[14:07.000 --> 14:13.000]  But I just go back to the basics. We're not in Kansas anymore. Truth is stranger than fiction.
[14:13.000 --> 14:19.000]  We told you 20 years ago they were selling baby parts, keeping babies alive, vivisecting them.
[14:19.000 --> 14:25.000]  Photos of Margaret Sanger addressing the Klan, her giving awards to Hitler, getting awards from Hitler.
[14:25.000 --> 14:31.000]  But notice that's all 20-year-old news for our audience. That's in mainstream news today.
[14:31.000 --> 14:35.000]  It's finally on TV news showing Margaret Sanger at Klan rallies.
[14:35.000 --> 14:42.000]  The point is, I use the Force 10 from Navarone Allegory. That's a composite based on a true story.
[14:42.000 --> 14:45.000]  Just like the Patriots based on three true stories.
[14:45.000 --> 14:49.000]  Force 10 from Navarone's base. He didn't even say this in the movie, but I'll read it in the history book.
[14:49.000 --> 14:51.000]  It's based on a true story.
[14:51.000 --> 14:57.000]  Where they bombed a dam in Croatia to flood the Germans and knock out a bridge.
[14:57.000 --> 15:01.000]  And it took about a day for the dam to finally crack and explode and collapse.
[15:01.000 --> 15:06.000]  In the movie it takes like 20 minutes. That's the same thing. We've already blown their ass.
[15:06.000 --> 15:10.000]  You understand that? We've already smashed the living hell out of the enemy.
[15:10.000 --> 15:15.000]  That's why they got to take everything over now. It's like, I'll use more Hollywood analogies.
[15:15.000 --> 15:21.000]  It's like sending a Terminator back in history to take out Sarah Connor because we've already won in the future.
[15:21.000 --> 15:30.000]  They've got to accelerate, take over, shut everything down now because we've already smashed the living hell out of them.
[15:30.000 --> 15:36.000]  And excuse me getting so excited, but I'm just here to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that it's all going to come out.
[15:36.000 --> 15:43.000]  The white slavery kidnapping rings. High level people in the federal government don't want to be part of this.
[15:43.000 --> 15:51.000]  The snuff films, the body parts, the government drug dealing, the Mexican drug cartels run by the CIA.
[15:51.000 --> 15:58.000]  Because people on the CIA don't want to go along with it. People are sick of it all. Everything's going to come out.
[15:58.000 --> 16:02.000]  And there's nothing they can do from stopping it.
[16:02.000 --> 16:07.000]  Here's the bad news. We're going to beat them on the current trajectory we're at.
[16:07.000 --> 16:18.000]  So they're tripling down now in their projections, in their war games, in their actuaries, in their analyses to try to beat us in the future.
[16:18.000 --> 16:24.000]  And I've looked at it. I don't have all their supercomputers and rest of it, but I've got history and the good sense God gave me.
[16:24.000 --> 16:27.000]  And I can sit back and look at them. I can tell you this.
[16:27.000 --> 16:33.000]  They're going to fail, but they may destroy the planet in the process of trying to keep control.
[16:33.000 --> 16:40.000]  So here's the big announcement for everybody. Get yourself strapped in because there's going to be big wars.
[16:40.000 --> 16:46.000]  There's going to be bioweapon releases. I think you're probably going to see nukes go off. They'll say they don't know who did it.
[16:46.000 --> 16:54.000]  It's going to get crazy. There is no doubt now we've crossed the threshold and are going into crazy town.
[16:54.000 --> 17:00.000]  I don't know how bad it's going to be. The faster we wake up, the more we wake up, may actually back them off.
[17:00.000 --> 17:07.000]  They may capitulate and just sue for peace and slow down. That's our only hope.
[17:07.000 --> 17:12.000]  And the reason so many of their own people are leaking info right now is they realize how evil this system is.
[17:12.000 --> 17:21.000]  They realize they were told a lie about globalism, that it was to bring in world peace, that it's a fraud,
[17:21.000 --> 17:27.000]  that it's been totally corrupted from the beginning. It was a deception.
[17:27.000 --> 17:34.000]  And that it all will come down.
[17:34.000 --> 17:39.000]  Now excuse me, using some mild French here on air. I apologize. It's just so real.
[17:39.000 --> 17:49.000]  In my gut, in my spirit, in my mind, I know that we've already placed explosives on the dam many times.
[17:49.000 --> 17:56.000]  It doesn't come down overnight and now it's starting to crack and the enemy can look at their system and tell it's coming down.
[17:56.000 --> 18:07.000]  That's why they want to go ahead and bring it all down, pose as the saviors and grab victory from the jaws of defeat.
[18:07.000 --> 18:14.000]  If we fail, we're going to be snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.
[18:14.000 --> 18:21.000]  All we got to do is spread the word. All we got to do is tell the truth. All we got to do is say we don't comply with unconstitutional garbage.
[18:21.000 --> 18:29.000]  All we got to do is stand strong and this system will come down. This system will fail. It will stall out.
[18:29.000 --> 18:37.000]  Does it mean we'll be in some utopia? Absolutely not. Does it mean we won't have bigger problems in some areas? No, we will.
[18:37.000 --> 18:47.000]  But there's forces of good and evil in this world, not just the evil. That's why everything they do is to dumb us down because they're scared of strong men and women.
[18:47.000 --> 18:54.000]  They're strong in the light in our eyes, they'll lighten our soul. They're scared of the fact that we want justice.
[18:54.000 --> 19:04.000]  We are outrageously horrifying to these people and we should be. If you look at our enemies, they are pathetically weak.
[19:04.000 --> 19:10.000]  That's why they seek power. It's time for good men and women to stand up and say no.
[19:10.000 --> 19:17.000]  And when we take that first mighty step into what appears to be oblivion, that's when God will catch us.
[19:17.000 --> 19:27.000]  But you have to take the first step and commit and say, just like that astronaut was talking about yesterday,
[19:27.000 --> 19:34.000]  once you get on top that rocket, you know there's a one-of-a-fifty chance going to blow up and kill you, but you're not a frag as you made the decision to do it.
[19:34.000 --> 19:46.000]  And some of us in this political system will be blown up. Some of us will be killed, destroyed, politically assassinated, but it's all part of God's greater plan.
[19:46.000 --> 19:54.000]  When we come back, the accelerating global meltdown now goes from a possibility to a probability as China begins to devalue.
[19:54.000 --> 20:00.000]  So I say to market lunch, look, you know, I keep hearing from the government that, you know, they're worried someday ISIS may get here.
[20:00.000 --> 20:06.000]  And I go, duck, a Garland, Texas, Mohammed cartoon shooting, ISIS is already here.
[20:06.000 --> 20:13.000]  I'm not waiting for these people to defend me. If they don't know ISIS as you already, they got no clue. I'm taking care of myself.
[20:13.000 --> 20:19.000]  Guns80.com, AR-15 kits, 30-shot magazines, great prices. They've even got the Hillary special.

[23:54.000 --> 24:17.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show. I'm Alex Jones.
[24:17.000 --> 24:22.000]  Knowing the globalist plans is key to stopping their operations.
[24:22.000 --> 24:40.000]  Educating the public that they are the social engineers, the economic and cultural masters that have shaped our world and that are pulling prosperity and decency down like a huge hydra pulling a ship into the North Atlantic.
[24:40.000 --> 25:04.000]  Here are the headlines on the China situation and we've got some great interns in here now and they're working on going back and getting our guest Earl Salente, Harry Dent, and so many others myself, talking about China being the time bomb for the economic meltdown.
[25:04.000 --> 25:16.000]  And the situation with the EU and Europe and deflation in the general economy with inflation in other areas of the economy.
[25:16.000 --> 25:23.000]  And really no one knows exactly what that mix, what that mix will be, but it's going to be serious.
[25:23.000 --> 25:34.000]  Again, I told you five and a half years ago that I talked to billionaires, elitist, government insiders, you name it. Some of them here on air.
[25:34.000 --> 25:40.000]  And they were saying get out of the United States within the next five years. That was in five years ago.
[25:40.000 --> 25:52.000]  And the quote, there wouldn't be a United States in five years. And I said, what does that mean? And they said, just what you say.
[25:52.000 --> 25:57.000]  What do you know? Don't have to tell you.
[25:57.000 --> 26:04.000]  Now, I hope to heaven that they're wrong. I hope to heaven all these signs are wrong.
[26:04.000 --> 26:17.000]  But it's like if you already had four or five heart attacks and your hand, your left hand gets numb and your shoulder starts hurting and your heart starts hurting, chances are you're having another heart attack.
[26:17.000 --> 26:23.000]  All the signs are there. And this time they're massing troops up against China and Russia.
[26:23.000 --> 26:36.000]  Because the one thing historically that will happen is during a total meltdown, governments will start wars before that even happens to politically divert the public's anger towards an outside enemy.
[26:36.000 --> 26:44.000]  That's just 101. When the economy goes belly up, they take you to war.
[26:44.000 --> 26:49.000]  China royals markets for second day as Yon tumbles the stocks.
[26:49.000 --> 27:02.000]  China has been pumping hundreds of billions of dollars, translated into Yon, into their stock market, as you know, the last month, trying to keep it up unsuccessfully.
[27:02.000 --> 27:14.000]  Now they're dropping their currency even further, which will kill any imports of even raw material into their country and put them at an even bigger advantage still.
[27:14.000 --> 27:24.000]  And that's why you see the major Pacific Fleet building up over there beforehand, because China began to break their deals with the globalist about three years ago.
[27:24.000 --> 27:35.000]  And I'm sorry, China is not Iraq or Assad.
[27:35.000 --> 27:44.000]  I mean, if you get in a war with the Chinese, they will fight. They'll just walk into machine gunfire and human wave attacks.
[27:44.000 --> 27:53.000]  Concerned China's economy is faltering torpedoed stocks around the world for a second day in fuel demand for the safety of gold and treasuries.
[27:53.000 --> 28:02.000]  See, I told you in my gut, I think gold's going up this fall and Christmas, even if there's an overall depression in other commodities.
[28:02.000 --> 28:10.000]  I just, I just see elites buying it up, institutions buying it up quietly.
[28:10.000 --> 28:16.000]  That's just my gut. Maybe it's wrong and maybe they'll manipulate that won't happen, but it's already going up.
[28:16.000 --> 28:23.000]  China's yawn slipped 1% in offshore trading, leading the biggest two-day slide in Asian currency since 2008.
[28:23.000 --> 28:30.000]  Well, speculation of financial markets turmoil will force the fellow reserve to delay raising interest rates, set the dollar tumbling versus the yen in the euro.
[28:30.000 --> 28:40.000]  The U.S. currency bolstered the investment appeal oil while a measure of global equity slid the most in a month.
[28:40.000 --> 28:45.000]  That's out of Bloomberg business.
[28:45.000 --> 28:50.000]  And it's like we had a time machine, if you were listening a year ago, six months ago, you, you heard about all this, remember?
[28:50.000 --> 28:51.000]  Not bragging.
[28:51.000 --> 28:58.000]  Mainstream media could have got all this right. They're paid to lie to you.
[28:58.000 --> 29:03.000]  I can't tell you how many major anchors have been down here or called me or I've run into an event in New York or LA and they go,
[29:03.000 --> 29:11.000]  Man, listen, let's get off our back. We're just doing our job. We know how bad it is. In fact, it's worse than you know. In fact, it's scary.
[29:11.000 --> 29:15.000]  If you don't tell anybody, I'm going to tell you a little.
[29:15.000 --> 29:22.000]  And I've had police chiefs, FBI all to get me going. I know we know. Believe me, it's worse than you know.
[29:22.000 --> 29:31.000]  Well, then stand up against it. I mean, there's got to be some point where we're going along with the system isn't a suicide pack.
[29:31.000 --> 29:37.000]  Nobody says you got to make waves, but when the ship's capsizing, you got to climb up on top of it or you're going to drown.
[29:37.000 --> 29:43.000]  We'll be back with the rest on the China situation on Hillary Clinton being FBI rated and more.
[29:43.000 --> 30:12.000]  We're on the March. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[30:12.000 --> 30:19.000]  This move had an immediate impact on the stock market. The U.S. stock market responded by dropping nearly 500 points in two days.
[30:19.000 --> 30:28.000]  Many fear this is the start of a currency war. Regular viewers of the Alex Jones show and Impo Wars Nightly News will note that we have been covering this story for many, many years.
[30:28.000 --> 30:36.000]  We've had predictions from Gerald Salente, Paul Craig Roberts, Harry Dent and a host of others saying this is the time that the plug is going to be pulled from the economy.
[30:36.000 --> 30:44.000]  This is a manufactured crisis to create a global currency by which every transaction can be analyzed and controlled.
[30:44.000 --> 31:12.000]  Stay tuned for more reports on the Info Wars Nightly News and the Alex Jones show. Rob Dew reporting for infowars.com.

[33:15.000 --> 33:28.000]  And I hope that judge ain't blind. Amorello by morning. Amorello's on my mind.
[33:28.000 --> 33:39.000]  Legionnaires' disease is super scary. It's at the biggest outbreak in history and it's now showing up in prisons and stuff and they say it's not related. Pretty creepy. We're going to break some of that down.
[33:39.000 --> 33:56.000]  Here's another headline. Russia and NATO actively preparing for war. You're like, tell us something you haven't told us 500 times. I know I've told you that, but now it's in the London Telegraph and governments are saying it.
[33:56.000 --> 34:18.000]  We've got a ton of news on the Hillary Clinton front where the FBI has now raided the hard drives and seized them and the DOJ has taken possession, which is also controlled by the very same people.
[34:18.000 --> 34:32.000]  She had satellite images, highly classified stuff on her computer. Again, top secret emails found as Clinton Prove expands to key aids. Go to drudgereport.com. It's got the big, blazoned headline.
[34:32.000 --> 34:40.000]  Hillary top secret email found. FBI seizes drives. DOJ takes possession. Satellite images.
[34:40.000 --> 34:57.000]  We'll break down some of the headlines at infowars.com as well. Video cop repeatedly smashes student with baton for refusing to comply, then caught lying on police report, now arrested and fired.
[34:57.000 --> 35:04.000]  I got to say, in more and more cases, when you get bad cops, they're being arrested or fired. Or both.
[35:04.000 --> 35:16.000]  Again, there's Kurt Nemo's article. NATO and Russia prepare for war. He basically rewrote and expanded on the Reuters story.
[35:16.000 --> 35:34.000]  Blacks for Smithsonian to remove exhibition honoring racist planned parenthood founder. Yeah, if you're going to dig up Confederate generals that had nothing to do with slavery and lie to a bunch of ignorant people, then you should certainly remove somebody who said blacks were subhuman and it should be killed.
[35:34.000 --> 35:43.000]  Minority report style ad billboard shaped like eyes to watch consumers. We're going to go into that article. It's up on infowars.com.
[35:43.000 --> 35:53.000]  A really bizarre story. This is NASA saying this. The universe is steadily deteriorating and so is the human race. What is happening?
[35:53.000 --> 36:04.000]  Inspector General says Clinton had top secret sensitive compartmentalized information. Angry customers to ditch target stores after they remove gender based signage.
[36:04.000 --> 36:14.000]  Boy's clothing section. Girls clothing. Boys toys. Girls toys. I mean just cult like attack on language.
[36:14.000 --> 36:22.000]  It's an occult attack on the species itself. Not of this world.
[36:22.000 --> 36:36.000]  But I want to get particularly into the world economy first. Then we'll talk to Congressman Jones. He isn't just coming on about the 28 pages.
[36:36.000 --> 36:52.000]  He's coming on. He contacted us, which is great because when he has breaking news he contacts us about the move to try to unseat Boehner from the Speaker of the House position.
[36:52.000 --> 36:59.000]  So Congressman Jones joins info wars in about 25 minutes on the move to remove Boehner.
[36:59.000 --> 37:11.000]  So we should tweet that Congressman will discuss plan afoot to remove Boehner from speakership live infowars.com.
[37:11.000 --> 37:17.000]  And then please retweet that out on Twitter everybody at Real Alex Jones so that folks can tune in and hear this info.
[37:17.000 --> 37:26.000]  Because if we promote it, if we push it, Boehner is very unpopular with the GOP. He's got like a 12% approval rating in national polls.
[37:26.000 --> 37:35.000]  He needs to be removed. And we need to put somebody in there like Walter Jones who has integrity and tells the truth.
[37:35.000 --> 37:44.000]  That's all we got to do is remove Nancy Pelosi and John Boehner and a few other nasty little creatures like Harry Reid from leadership positions.
[37:44.000 --> 37:50.000]  And we can take this country back. Most governors don't want to deep six the country.
[37:50.000 --> 37:57.000]  Most county commissioners don't. Most people want prosperity and justice, but they're compartmentalized.
[37:57.000 --> 38:02.000]  They're not part of the main power structure. So they're not aware of what's really going on.
[38:02.000 --> 38:07.000]  And if you tell them, hey, Planned Parenthood secretly sells baby parts, they say no way they go to jail for that.
[38:07.000 --> 38:14.000]  And so now that it comes out, they go, okay, let's start criminal investigations in 14 states looking to start indicting Planned Parenthood.
[38:14.000 --> 38:24.000]  See, we have to be laughed at, tell the truth, force the truth out, make it safe for others to look at it, and then everything will collapse in the enemy operation.
[38:24.000 --> 38:34.000]  I've told you many times their strongest point and their weakest point is the same thing. They're over the top insane, over the top diabolical, over the top evil.
[38:34.000 --> 38:45.000]  And the average person just does not want to grab a child out of a playground and torture him for a month in a subterranean torture base while worshipping Satan.
[38:45.000 --> 38:54.000]  The average person doesn't want to get with 15 people in black rubs and torture a two-year-old for three days, sucking the blood out of them, like Satanists do with cutting them all over their body.
[38:54.000 --> 39:05.000]  The average person doesn't want to sell baby parts and buy Lamborghinis. The average person doesn't want to put a brain-eating acid in the water to brain damage people.
[39:05.000 --> 39:16.000]  The average person doesn't want one in three by 2025, that's the CDC believes, one in three will be wearing diapers and basically a football helmet, not knowing who they are.
[39:16.000 --> 39:27.000]  I mean it's just epic, legendary, over the top, 500 times Twilight Zone, we live it.
[39:27.000 --> 39:33.000]  The average person doesn't believe Dinecore, loads up C-130s for little kids and flies them into black holes.
[39:33.000 --> 39:42.000]  But it's been in the news, been in congressional hearings, nobody got in trouble.
[39:42.000 --> 39:51.000]  You take a Gardasil shot, you're going to have serious autoimmune problems, you're going to have fertility problems and sometimes you're going to end up dying or in a wheelchair for the rest of your life.
[39:51.000 --> 39:59.000]  And we knew it during the trials 10 years ago, it came out, it's been banned in more than, what is it, 10 countries, 11 countries? Or restricted?
[39:59.000 --> 40:09.000]  And you don't even hear that here, they're testing, being able to maim everybody and get away with it.
[40:09.000 --> 40:23.000]  Not in Kansas anymore and it's my job to smash through the lies and disinformation, to crash through it, to blow holes in it.
[40:23.000 --> 40:32.000]  It's my job to be destroyed, it's my job to go in and explode and then lead everybody else into defeat the enemy and I'm not the only one doing it.
[40:32.000 --> 40:40.000]  But I'll tell you, I was analyzing this morning while I was psychoanalyzing myself, being retrospective and I thought, man, why isn't I not afraid?
[40:40.000 --> 40:48.000]  Why isn't I'm ready to die? Why is it I don't care and I'm so committed because I realize the whole species is dying and it's a normal instinct.
[40:48.000 --> 41:00.000]  And then the cherry on top is, I've been involved in abortions and I've been involved in bad things and so every minute is a blessing and whatever God does to me, it's what I deserve.
[41:00.000 --> 41:11.000]  I'm free and I repent of everything I've been involved in and I just offer myself up to resist evil and it doesn't mean I'm perfect, it doesn't mean I have all the answers, but let me tell you, God is with me and I can feel it.
[41:11.000 --> 41:22.000]  The providence is there and I just wish other people could share in this because it's an epic, epic, epic time to be alive.
[41:22.000 --> 41:36.000]  And I will, I will do whatever it takes to not be a disgraceful evil person when I die.
[41:36.000 --> 41:45.000]  And I just feel so sorry for people out there that have no common sense and who don't realize that all that matters is who you are, your soul.
[41:45.000 --> 42:01.000]  The first thing the world tells you is you don't have a soul and then all these major elites, when I've infiltrated the organizations and their groups, they are the most superstitious, occult, obsessed people you could ever imagine and they don't want you to know about any of this stuff so you're totally spiritually blind,
[42:01.000 --> 42:11.000]  spiritually stupid, so that you don't understand that they're using occult systems of manipulation to control the planet.
[42:11.000 --> 42:20.000]  All occult means is hidden. The CIA that's been secret since 1947 and above the law is occult.
[42:20.000 --> 42:35.000]  We are the anti-occult. We're here to expose the fraud. We're here to bring it out in the light
[42:35.000 --> 42:49.000]  because vampires, parasites, roaches don't like the sun. I love the sun.
[42:49.000 --> 42:54.000]  And we're going to drag them kicking and screaming out at high noon out of their crypts.
[42:54.000 --> 43:01.000]  And we don't have to do anything to them. We just have to spiritually drag the enemy out in the open square and they will burst into flames.
[43:01.000 --> 43:13.000]  The allegory is so true. They will burn. They will turn to dust in front of our eyes the minute we recognize the light.
[43:13.000 --> 43:23.000]  But to bring light into the world, to bring God's light into the world, we have to be the vessels for that light.
[43:23.000 --> 43:32.000]  We have to be the conduit for that light. And that doesn't mean going to the church and acting how moral you are and how you're perfect
[43:32.000 --> 43:38.000]  and how you never looked at pornography or you never drank a beer or you're high and mighty and more proper than everyone else.
[43:38.000 --> 43:46.000]  That's not what God's looking for, a bunch of Pharisees. God's looking for people that love justice and love God and love innocence
[43:46.000 --> 43:53.000]  and love creativity and love truth and who are willing to stand up against demons, who are willing to stand up against corrupt people,
[43:53.000 --> 44:01.000]  who are willing to get on that field and who aren't afraid.
[44:01.000 --> 44:08.000]  A lot of you out there don't believe in God. You don't believe in spiritual things. You don't believe in other dimensions which have been proven.
[44:08.000 --> 44:17.000]  Let me tell you something about the metaphysical world that's guaranteed. It's based on free will and you open and close the gate to evil and to good,
[44:17.000 --> 44:26.000]  to apathy and to strength. You have to make the decision that you want to see the matrix.
[44:26.000 --> 44:34.000]  You have to make the decision that you want to go down the rabbit hole. You have to make the decision and open yourself up.
[44:34.000 --> 44:41.000]  The truth is you think you're not open to those forces. If you're not open to good in your mind, you're open to bad.
[44:41.000 --> 44:49.000]  So the truth is you're already wide open, standing in the middle of the road, the most dangerous place to be, Lukewarm.
[44:49.000 --> 44:58.000]  You want to make a conscious decision and while you're alive on this planet, give it one shot when you look at all this fantasticness around you
[44:58.000 --> 45:09.000]  and you don't think there's more, there's a lot more on heaven and earth than in all your books to quote Shakespeare.
[45:09.000 --> 45:15.000]  I want to get into the economy. I want to briefly tell folks that we have a very exciting announcement.
[45:15.000 --> 45:19.000]  We got more of the brain force, the proprietary product.
[45:19.000 --> 45:28.000]  Let me get Anthony in here later to cover some medical news. Maybe when he comes in to cover health and medical news, he can go over this because he worked with the chemists and designers
[45:28.000 --> 45:33.000]  with the known compounds that are known to boost brain activity.
[45:33.000 --> 45:38.000]  But there are now reviews on this because the first batch came in a few months ago. It's sold out in four days.
[45:38.000 --> 45:45.000]  Another batch has come in and the laboratory could not supply a bigger batch.
[45:45.000 --> 45:50.000]  One-tenth of this sold out in just the first three hours of sale.
[45:50.000 --> 45:55.000]  I predict it will sell out by tomorrow. If you want to try brain force, haven't been able to get it in the last two months.
[45:55.000 --> 46:00.000]  Brain force is back in. Then in about two weeks, we have a larger shipment coming in.
[46:00.000 --> 46:07.000]  They say, might be six weeks for all I know, that it's because it's hard to get the organic concentrated ingredients.
[46:07.000 --> 46:10.000]  If I'd use crudier ones, it'd be no problem.
[46:10.000 --> 46:18.000]  We're kind of victims of our own fact that we want to have something so good, but clean, healthy energy, waking up the mind.
[46:18.000 --> 46:24.000]  Brain force is back and I predict it'll be sold out within 48 hours at current sales rates.
[46:24.000 --> 46:28.000]  We appreciate you purchasing it. This place costs a lot of money to run and operate.
[46:28.000 --> 46:39.000]  I used to want to stay small, but I had enemies try to destroy me, try to set me up, demonize me for even trying to have five employees and even having a modest house and a modest vehicle.
[46:39.000 --> 46:43.000]  So I said, you know what? I have all these enemies. They must not want me to become successful.
[46:43.000 --> 46:50.000]  I have a responsibility to fund a larger operation and to not reach two or three million a week like I was reaching 15 years ago,
[46:50.000 --> 46:54.000]  but to reach 20 million a week like we're reaching now and 40, 50, 100.
[46:54.000 --> 46:57.000]  You know, we're going to go all the way. We're committed.
[46:57.000 --> 47:05.000]  So I'm so proud of Rachel Maddow and MSNBC demonizing the fact that we sell high quality supplements that even on the herbal nerd sites,
[47:05.000 --> 47:16.000]  they say, you know, five star because this is the organic concentrated highest quality nutraceuticals at very competitive prices.
[47:16.000 --> 47:20.000]  That's a win-win and we're going to grow even more, God willing.
[47:20.000 --> 47:27.000]  We're going to go all the way and we're going to be successful because Providence is on our side, at least for now.
[47:27.000 --> 47:29.000]  And we're thankful for that. So thank you all for your support.
[47:29.000 --> 47:36.000]  But if you want to get this incredibly high quality product, it's available right now at infowarslife.com
[47:36.000 --> 47:41.000]  or by calling toll free 888-253-3139er.
[47:41.000 --> 47:47.000]  And briefly, here are some of the new brain force reviews.
[47:47.000 --> 47:50.000]  This is a 5.0. It has a 5.9 right now for this product.
[47:50.000 --> 47:58.000]  The average is 4.8 and that's with the power review site, one of the most highly respected out there.
[47:58.000 --> 48:02.000]  Excellent product. I feel great and very noticeably efficient.
[48:02.000 --> 48:05.000]  A great energy, which also let me feeling no side effects.
[48:05.000 --> 48:09.000]  Sad, the bottle is almost empty and I can't wait until it's back in stock.
[48:09.000 --> 48:14.000]  That's Tom Biggs from New Jersey. Thank you, Tom, for your support.
[48:14.000 --> 48:17.000]  Here's another one.
[48:17.000 --> 48:20.000]  Grandma, Zach, Rolling Meadows, Illinois.
[48:20.000 --> 48:24.000]  My husband and I both take brain force every day and it's helped us remember better and function better.
[48:24.000 --> 48:31.000]  Husband stated before taking, he would sometimes feel like he was in a fog since starting brain force, he no longer has that problem.
[48:31.000 --> 48:35.000]  I'll recommend this to a friend.
[48:35.000 --> 48:42.000]  50 is the new 30. Atlanta, Georgia. I'm an herbalist nut. I never put trust in traditional medicine.
[48:42.000 --> 48:49.000]  I am upwards of 40 and need a boost. I've been listening to Alex Jones since 2007 and found him to be reputable.
[48:49.000 --> 48:55.000]  So I said, I'll try some no vitality. Hallelujah. It works. It works too well. No side effects.
[48:55.000 --> 49:00.000]  I don't know if I'm addicted. Got to have it. Seriously, I've found lightning in a bottle.
[49:00.000 --> 49:08.000]  I've found Pounce Dionnes Fountain of Youth. If I pronounce that right. Yes, I would recommend it.
[49:08.000 --> 49:13.000]  Here's another one. I'm going to stop. Gary in Barrel City, Texas.
[49:13.000 --> 49:17.000]  Tastes great. Give him more stamina, more energy. Feel great. Sleep better.
[49:17.000 --> 49:20.000]  He does that because it jacked up the other day and just a great product.
[49:20.000 --> 49:25.000]  And see, it's got the known compounds that are in your brain. One of the compounds actually in the brain.
[49:25.000 --> 49:32.000]  It's prescription in Europe. Anthony will briefly pop in the next hour and talk about he's got other news, but I wanted to go over the science.
[49:32.000 --> 49:37.000]  I want to show you some of the studies. And so I'll only take one or two a day.
[49:37.000 --> 49:43.000]  And noticeably, people have seen the energy, the stamina, been able to shoot more reports, do more, get more done.
[49:43.000 --> 49:51.000]  And it doesn't have speed in it to just speed you up. It does have some Urimate. There's a different type of caffeine, but a small dose of that.
[49:51.000 --> 49:55.000]  But it'll definitely knock your socks off as well. So brain force is back in.
[49:55.000 --> 50:00.000]  And it is my goal to have this stuff come in in small lots and sell out to create artificial scarcity.
[50:00.000 --> 50:03.000]  We want to be able to have it, promote it and fund our operation.
[50:03.000 --> 50:09.000]  So we should have more in in two weeks. It shouldn't have any sellouts of that for a while.
[50:09.000 --> 50:14.000]  Also, super male vitality is back in. It was sold out for a couple months.
[50:14.000 --> 50:19.000]  And it's concentrated herbs and key compounds on to get your glands going again.
[50:19.000 --> 50:29.000]  You can see the thousands of reviews on that product at infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[50:29.000 --> 50:36.000]  Okay, I'm going to get into China in detail when we come back.
[50:36.000 --> 50:42.000]  And then Congressman Walter Jones joins us and we'll get into the move to remove Maynard.
[50:42.000 --> 50:48.000]  And we'll also segue into the announcements of attacking Assad and their military that's fighting ISIS.
[50:48.000 --> 51:07.000]  And how outrageous that is, we have Jeff Bush's comments backing it.

[53:48.000 --> 54:11.000]  So the world debt is exponentially climbing. Most of it is fiat debt, not created by even governments or individuals, but we've been signed on to it.
[54:11.000 --> 54:18.000]  China that the mainstream media has been telling us is a great economy the last few years. Stock markets have been imploding.
[54:18.000 --> 54:26.000]  They've been devaluing their currency by design to out-compete other competitors when no one can even compete with China because things are so rigged.
[54:26.000 --> 54:37.000]  Stock markets are down across the world. Here's the headline from MarketWatch. China could trigger the biggest financial route since 2008.
[54:37.000 --> 54:46.000]  But don't worry, they'll have a global stabilization package, trillions to the bankers, and more free interest rates for them, but higher for us.
[54:46.000 --> 54:51.000]  Don't worry, they'll have a managed global economy the next step to save us.
[54:51.000 --> 55:07.000]  So much for that one-time correction, the People's Bank of China let the yon drop again overnight, fixing the currency 1.6 below Tuesday's close following the 1.9 evaluation heard around the world a day ago.
[55:07.000 --> 55:27.000]  So massive devaluations daily. And the average person, as I don't care what goes over there in China, well, if you dig in your backyard, you run into them. It affects us completely because our entire industrial base has basically been shipped there.
[55:27.000 --> 55:33.000]  All we do is print money and then I guess the Chinese women come here to have their babies for free.
[55:33.000 --> 55:39.000]  And if you don't pay for it as a taxpayer or a racist, of course, you can't go to China and have a baby for free. They laugh at you.
[55:39.000 --> 55:43.000]  Maybe harvest your organs, but that's okay because they're not white.
[55:43.000 --> 55:52.000]  Deutsche Bank, for one, is predicting that the yon is overvalued by around 10%, so if the yon continues to weaken, things could get a lot darker for markets.
[55:52.000 --> 55:59.000]  And stocks aren't dealing with the new China reality that we've seen so far.
[55:59.000 --> 56:08.000]  The Crack Market Blog says the U.S. market reaction in S&P fell 1% today and yesterday and futures are pointing sharply lower.
[56:08.000 --> 56:12.000]  Here's another one, Financial Times of London.
[56:12.000 --> 56:21.000]  What's next? A China housing crash? And that's the big one that most of our experts agree is the key trigger they're looking at.
[56:21.000 --> 56:30.000]  Could be war in the Middle East, could be war with Russia, could be a major scandal, could be a new Enron type deal, but the big one.
[56:30.000 --> 56:38.000]  Could be new derivatives news or a state or major city going under like Chicago or LA, but the big one is the Chinese housing market.
[56:38.000 --> 56:45.000]  Prices have fallen, but high deposit required means low risk of crisis.
[56:45.000 --> 56:52.000]  China's equity markets cool down, its currency is devalued, attention will return to the question of whether the country's property market is heading for a fall.
[56:52.000 --> 57:01.000]  In my view, the boom days are over, but with buyers required to put at least 30% downcast, the risk of a crisis are low.
[57:01.000 --> 57:10.000]  Unless they just walk away, they're always telling us it's low as it all happens.
[57:10.000 --> 57:21.000]  And they're not mentioning that they forced all people out of the countryside into these cities, and then as their manufacturing economy goes belly up during a global depression, that's what we're in.
[57:21.000 --> 57:28.000]  Under a global depression, it will cause incredible destabilization in a country that has thousands of riots a month.
[57:28.000 --> 57:32.000]  China's currency devaluation could spark tidal wave of deflation.
[57:32.000 --> 57:44.000]  London Guardian, Western central banks, advised to resist raising interest rates and told to prepare to ward off deflationary slump in the face of cheaper Chinese exports.
[57:44.000 --> 57:48.000]  Make no mistake, this is the start of something big, something ugly.
[57:48.000 --> 58:03.000]  The city bank economist Albert Edwards rarely mentions his words, but his reaction to China's devaluation, which hit shock waves through global markets, underlined how powerfully Beijing's move maybe fell thousands of miles away.
[58:03.000 --> 58:09.000]  And in the next hour after Walter Jones leaves us with Congressman, we'll get more into that.
[58:09.000 --> 58:14.000]  China's currency devaluation since global exports reeling.
[58:14.000 --> 58:19.000]  China's devaluation marks escalation of currency war.
[58:19.000 --> 58:26.000]  And then coming up, 12 signs that an imminent global financial crash has become even more likely.
[58:26.000 --> 58:28.000]  Who keeps warning you about this?
[58:28.000 --> 58:30.000]  Gold and silver surges, dollar slumps.
[58:30.000 --> 58:34.000]  It's all coming up second hour, so your friends and family tune in.
[58:34.000 --> 58:36.000]  This is an emergency transmission.

[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:12.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:17.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:28.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're now into hour number two.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:35.000]  Congressman Walter Jones with big news on the move to remove Boehner will be joining us.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:42.000]  Coming up at the start of the next segment, then we've got some major breaking health news.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.000]  We're going to have a guest in studio on that subject.
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:50.000]  And then we're going to continue with open phones in the third hour.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:57.000]  Specifically dealing with what's happening in China, devaluing their currency.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:04.000]  Almost four points in just the last two days to further undermine everybody else's finished goods.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.000]  Value added products around the world.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:13.000]  And really breaking the deal they have with the globalists to make them the major industrial city.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:20.000]  Because it's kind of a rollerball globalist model where different countries under globalism,
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.000]  one's a military country, one's the industrial country, one's the energy sector,
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.000]  one's the entertainment sector, media sector.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  So there's not war anymore to make everybody dependent.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:34.000]  Well, the globalists just used that to consolidate power for themselves and then sold weapons in the back
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000]  to destabilize things even more.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000]  So that's coming up.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.000]  Twelve signs of an imminent global financial crash.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000]  Has it come even more likely?
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000]  The story about Michael Snyder is excellent.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000]  It's up on infowars.com.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000]  Did you see what just happened?
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000]  I'm going to cover this in detail, but let's get into it right now.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:57.000]  The devaluation of the Yonba China triggered the largest one-day drop of the currency in modern era.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:02.000]  This caused other global currencies to crash relatively U.S. dollar.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:07.000]  The price of oil hit a six-year low and stock markets all over the world were rattled.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:14.000]  The Dow fell 212 points on Tuesday and Apple stock plummeted another 5%.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:20.000]  As we hurdle towards the absolutely critical months of September and October,
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:27.000]  if it's an organized, orchestrated collapse, it'll be in October so they can fearmonger, get things fixed,
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:31.000]  get a power grab package and a bailout package by November and then still have a Christmas.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:39.000]  But if it crashes in November or December, I don't think it's rigged then and boy, it could go all the way.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:44.000]  But don't worry, the elites are headed to their bunkers right now, but we shouldn't fearmonger.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  If we're lucky and can stop this or slow it down or have a smooth landing, then it's, oh, really?
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:57.000]  Where was the global crisis, Alex? You only predicted it would come and it came, but it wasn't that bad.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:03.000]  Don't you people sound like idiots now?
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:10.000]  And I wish I wasn't right. I wish I wasn't wrong about all of it.
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:17.000]  But we don't make stuff up. You know, knock on wood.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:20.000]  I have never been sued for libel or slander.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:25.000]  Other people threaten it and then I just have my lawyer's contact and go, well, here's our evidence and here's our source.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:30.000]  So you can sue our source if you want, who said another publication or a document.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:35.000]  But usually we're just going off an admitted document, a court case and admission.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:43.000]  It's not us saying it. 95% of what we cover is open source intelligence.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:56.000]  5% is my analysis and where I think it's going and that's proven very accurate, but it's not hard when you have a historical context.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:05.000]  And the patriots worldwide, people that want stability, want decency, that are throughout the system. It's not just evil out there acting, operating.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:09.000]  We've been trying to stop all this. So we're like holding the gate back with the enemy trying to come in.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:18.000]  You're like, you say there's an enemy horde out there and like swords are sticking through the wall and people are climbing over the parapet and falling on top people and fireballs are shooting in.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:23.000]  And you're like, oh, you claim there's fireballs and then one flies over and burns their hair.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:27.000]  And you're like, I don't see any fireballs as their hair is on fire.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:31.000]  So you claim they're selling baby parts, dead baby plops right beside them.
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:36.000]  I don't know what you're talking about. You claim Margaret Sanger's a non-c, you're the racist.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:43.000]  C'mon, set so. We wear pink sweaters and talk with a lisp. That means we're intellectual.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.000]  Margaret Sanger was never involved in anything.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:50.000]  And Christ was not the Messiah, as Pastor Hayes says as well.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:30.000]  The rifle maker tracking point launched in 2011 sold more than a thousand of its Linux powered rifles with a self aiming system.
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:36.000]  The scope allows you to designate a target and dial in the variables like wind temperature and weight of the ammunition being fired.

[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:30.000]  Welcome to the second hour of the broadcast on this Wednesday, the 12th day of August, 2015.
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:41.000]  Coming up, the shocking degeneration of the Chinese stock market and their currency, the Yon, and how that's going to affect the United States.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:51.000]  With Congressman, former Congressman Ron Paul and others warning that the day of reckoning is coming probably this fall or this winter.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:09:00.000]  And we have Gerald Salente, we have Harry Dent, we have Max Kaiser, we have Peter Schiff,
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:10.000]  we have a whole bunch of financial experts that have been accurately breaking down what's coming joining us this week and next week.
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:19.000]  Joining us now is Representative Walter Jones, Jones.house.gov and 28pages.org.
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:25.000]  And of course, he is a Congressman serving his ninth term from North Carolina.
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:39.000]  And he joins us to break down the huge development that he and others have been spearheading to try to remove Speaker Boehner from his position.
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:47.000]  We could get rid of Pelosi out of leadership, Harry Reid in the Senate, people like Boehner when he's not playing golf with Obama.
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:55.000]  He's defending Obamacare. We can't defund Planned Parenthood. We can't stop partial birth abortion.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:04.000]  We can't control the borders. We can't keep the power plants on even though there's no law to shut them off because Boehner,
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:10.000]  whether he's blackmailed or whether he's paid off or whether he's had lobotomy, we don't know.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:16.000]  But with a Republican Speaker of the House like this, you might as well just put Nancy Pelosi back in there.
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:19.000]  At least we know who she is.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.000]  So Representative Walter Jones is here to give us the inside baseball.
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:29.000]  We're very thankful to him on what happened last week and the fact that this could still happen if people get behind it.
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:37.000]  And this could be a real game changer. I don't have to tell the audience that if we're able to remove these rhinos out of the power structure.
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:47.000]  And then we'll look at federal lawsuit could reveal the contents of 28 pages omitted from 9-11 report implicating the Saudi government quarterbacking the operation.
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.000]  And of course Congressman Jones has been exposing that.
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:56.000]  Now they're saying take out Assad to defeat ISIS when ISIS is al-Qaeda Saudi Arabian funded.
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:07.000]  This is the Republican and Democratic leadership playing on the ignorance of the public saying take out Assad who has been fighting al-Qaeda to stop al-Qaeda.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:11.000]  So just incredible. Walter Jones is an expert on this as well.
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000]  Thank you so much for joining us, sir.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:21.000]  And please give us an update on exactly what's happening as the mainstream media is not covering the fact that Boehner is in some trouble, isn't he?
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:28.000]  Yes, and Alex, thank you. It's always an honor and pleasure to be on your show. I appreciate you telling the truth to the American people.
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:43.000]  And on this issue, let me, for those that may be not as familiar as you are and I, we in the Congress have been very frustrated by John Boehner and the fact that he does not follow conservative principles.
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:54.000]  You can blame President Obama for spending money, but he can't raise the debt ceiling unless we in Congress pass legislation to allow him to raise that debt ceiling.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:12:02.000]  So let me go to where we are now. Mark Meadows, who is also a Congressman from North Carolina, he's from the mountain area.
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:08.000]  I'm from the coastal area. And we have been talking for months now about what we could do.
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:20.000]  We tried to get into a second round back in January with Mr. Boehner trying to get 29 votes to send it to a second round and then maybe we could get him out in January.
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:24.000]  That did not happen. So the frustration has continued.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:39.000]  And we met about five or six weeks ago. Ted Yeho from Florida, Thomas Massey from Kentucky, myself and Mark Meadows talking about what can we do? What kind of opportunities do we have as members of Congress to bring the Congress back to the people?
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:46.000]  It's their house, not our house. And so Mr. Meadows came up with this idea of vacating the chair.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:54.000]  So he and Thomas Massey worked together on a resolution, it's H Resolution 385.
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:13:01.000]  H Resolution 385. Your listeners can go on anybody's website, mine or anyone else and find this.
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:07.000]  Let me read two parts of this very quickly to get us talking, Alex.
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:25.000]  The first is this in the resolution, whereas the Speaker of the House of Representatives for the 114th Congress has endeavored to consolidate power and centralize decision-making, bypassing the majority of the 435 members of the Congress and the people they represent.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:35.000]  Just another one. Whereas the Speaker uses the power of the office to punish members who vote according to their conscience instead of the will of the Speaker.
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:50.000]  The last one. Whereas the Speaker continues to direct the Rules Committee to limit meaningful amendments, to limit debate on the House floor and to subvert a straightforward legislative process.
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:56.000]  There are just three of the eight, whereas it's in the resolution by Mr. Meadows.
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:15.000]  And Massey, I and Mr. Yeho have joined him in cosponsing this resolution. Why I am honored and pleased to be on your show again, Alex, is that any of your listeners, whatever state they might be in, if they would call their member of Congress, all of them a home now for the next three, four weeks, actually,
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:26.000]  and call them and ask them to tell the person that answers the phone to remind that Congressman that he or she could join in this resolution to vacate the chair.
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:36.000]  And if we can get enough votes, what will happen? We will have a straight, up and down vote on who the next Speaker should be to replace John Dana.
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:45.000]  And we really, I have nothing against the Speaker personally. He's a good man personally, but he is not a policy leader.
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:50.000]  And we need to return this country back, this government, excuse me, government back to the people.
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:57.000]  Again, Congressman Walter Jones of North Carolina joins us. You can go to jones.house.gov and read the bill.
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.000]  We just put it on screen and also read the Daily Signal article.
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:07.000]  Conservative Congressman seeks to oust John Boehner as House Speaker. Look, you're a gentleman, and I respect that.
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:14.000]  I know Boehner reportedly is very nice, very charming, very friendly, but then he will viciously, as you mentioned, through his whip and others.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:19.000]  You might explain how that works. Go after members of the House that don't follow his orders.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:27.000]  So I don't care how nice he is when he sticks a knife in your back. He needs to be removed, whether it's on partial birth abortion that we had the votes on,
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:32.000]  or whether it's Obamacare, or whether it's shutting off the power plants or the open borders or the debt limit.
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:36.000]  I mean, this is one of the, I mean, he makes Newt Genrich look good and Genrich was a sellout.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:42.000]  This guy is completely out of control, and we need to start a hashtag like fire Boehner.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:52.000]  Let's put that out at real Alex Jones. Fire Boehner, and then let's link to the resolution that's linked on Congressman Jones's site.
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:57.000]  But there's the headline from Politico, House conservative seat, John Boehner's ouster.
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:04.000]  And let's get this moving to hashtag fire Boehner. I mean, we've recalled Republican governors that act like this.
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:14.000]  We've recalled other people. I mean, it's outrageous just on Obamacare alone, but explain to people how all this parliamentary procedure works.
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:17.000]  Because I know they were going to bring it up for a vote to try to kill this bill.
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:20.000]  I'm told they didn't learn they didn't have enough votes to kill it.
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:25.000]  Since then, I've been trying to follow it. Explain to us the Byzantine machinations.
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:32.000]  Okay. Alex, the H Resolution 385 is now in the Rules Committee.
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:42.000]  The Rules Committee will be the committee that will determine to send this back to the full house, meaning back to the floor of the house for a vote.
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:55.000]  And you're exactly right. The day after Mark Meadows put this in, Mr. Boehner's people were thinking about go ahead and bring it out of the Rules Committee back on the floor and kill it before the August break.
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:05.000]  You're exactly right. What happened was that the Jim Jordan from Ohio got word to the leadership that if you try this, you might be embarrassed.
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:14.000]  Because let me remind your listeners of this. Every member sitting on the floor of the house will have a chance to vote to vacate the chair.
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:18.000]  And then that would mean there would be another vote for the speaker of the house.
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:23.000]  And it would be a new person if that happened. So that's where it is.
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:37.000]  And so what we're trying to do, the ones I have mentioned, Yoho, Massey, Meadows, and myself, Walter Jones, we're trying to get on as many shows, people who have a national audience like yourself to talk about this issue.
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:48.000]  Because there's so many things going on in Washington that it's not the people's house anymore, Alex. It's controlled by money. It's the special interest house, not the people's house.
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:56.000]  And we won't have a speaker of the house that will let us do our job and represent the people of our district without being threatened.
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:03.000]  Well, again, I'm going to skip this network break because we're just having to the bottom of the hour. Congressman Walter Jones joins us.
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:13.000]  And I tell you, it's very humbling, sir, and quite frankly, borders on obscene for you to be thanking myself for having you on when you're the one going up against this mafia.
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:20.000]  You're the one exposing Saudi Arabia 9-11. You're the one doing this. And I know you don't like praise, but people need to be praying for you.
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:27.000]  You've got a lot of courage and quite frankly, you're doing some things that even Ron Paul wasn't doing when he was Congressman.
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:32.000]  He went after the Federal Reserve. You're going right at the heart with some really dangerous people.
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:37.000]  So please don't thank us, sir. We want to thank you for working so hard.
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:44.000]  And again, it's not about praise, but folks need to understand the position you're in, working so hard, doing all these interviews,
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:54.000]  helping get the bills out in the face of this guy and in the threats. Let's talk about how Boehner threatens people and the way he twists arms to keep things like Obamacare afloat.
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:19:02.000]  Well, Alex, let me give the trade promotion authority, TPA, which was a vote about three weeks ago, maybe four now.
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:08.000]  And I think this is what really brought us to a head, to be honest about it. We had the votes on the rule.
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:14.000]  As you know, a rule has to be voted on by the House before you get to the debate on the bill itself.
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:17.000]  We actually had the votes to kill the rule.
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:23.000]  Mr. Boehner and the President wanted this bill to pass to give the President the trade promotion authority,
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:29.000]  meaning he could bypass Congress with any type of treaty, and all Congress could do is to vote up and down.
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:35.000]  No ability to amend it. So we would give away our right to amend. So let me go back to the rule now.
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:41.000]  You have to have a rule that sets the parameters of the debate. So we had the votes to kill the rule.
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:50.000]  Three members of the Republican House who had been in this whip organization had voted with us on this rule.
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:56.000]  What happened a day later? They were kicked off the whip team. That's not a big thing.
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:03.000]  Then we've had other members who voted against Boehner who were denied the right to go on these overseas trips
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:07.000]  with other members of Congress, meaning Republicans and Democrats.
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:12.000]  I have a bill that is a minor thing in a way, but let me explain it very quickly.
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:18.000]  A dear friend of mine, a 55-year-old federal bankruptcy judge, died suddenly of a heart attack.
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:21.000]  We have the courthouse here in my district.
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:27.000]  We wanted to name the courthouse for this judge, Judge Randy Dapp. He's a Republican.
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:32.000]  But the Democrats, everybody said he was a very fair-minded person, and they won't move that bill.
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:36.000]  I've got it through the committee, but they won't move it to the floor of the house.
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:39.000]  So what they do is they won't move your bills. You want to go out for trade for your state.
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:43.000]  On these trade missions, they won't let you go. They basically cut you off.
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:46.000]  But bigger than that, it's Boehner's been caught, as you know.
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:51.000]  It's been in the news with a Democrat's meeting with big think tanks and big lenders
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:54.000]  and big donors on how to go after the Tea Party.
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:57.000]  So he's been quietly, while telling the Tea Party to play nice,
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:03.000]  he's been trying to kill the libertarian constitutionalist movement that could save this country.
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:10.000]  I've got to say it, Boehner is worse than Benedict Arnold when it comes to settling this country out.
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:17.000]  You're right, and Alex, let me say this. The point is that when we are elected
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:23.000]  to represent the people of our district, we're not sent to Washington to be a puppet
[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:26.000]  for the speaker of the house. And that's one thing, this resolution.
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:29.000]  I hope you'll listen to us. We'll look it up.
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:36.000]  H-Resolution 385. We're there to represent the people of our district, the people across this nation.
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:41.000]  No one should dictate to our conscience how we should vote.
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:44.000]  And if I have a minute or two, I'd like to explain something that happened recently.
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000]  Clay Sir, you've got the floor.
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:52.000]  Okay. We had a bill two months ago that the Republicans brought to the floor of the house
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:57.000]  that would allow the mobile home companies in writing their contracts
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:04.000]  to someone that wants to buy a mobile home to raise the interest rate from 8% to 11%.
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:09.000]  Warren Buffett, who is a billionaire in his financial portfolio,
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:14.000]  owns 91% of all the mobile home businesses in America.
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:19.000]  And I could not vote for that because in my district, the eastern part of North Carolina,
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:23.000]  we have over 45,000 mobile homes where people are living.
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:27.000]  We have people every day that the best they can do is to buy a mobile home.
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:33.000]  I could not raise the interest rate from 8% to 11% on that person trying to buy a mobile home
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:39.000]  to help Warren Buffett become a million, have more millions going to his billions.
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:45.000]  And let's not forget, he gets billions in 0% rates and is the biggest recipient of the banker bailout
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:50.000]  while he lobbies for regulations that actually make it more expensive
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:56.000]  to be able to get affordable housing because he basically controls the regulators and is exempt from it.
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000]  I mean, this guy is a monster.
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:02.000]  Alex, that's why we need to change the leadership of the house.
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:09.000]  We need somebody up there in that position that understands that those of us elected from districts in America,
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:15.000]  we represent the people of this country, not the wishes of the special interest.
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000]  It's funny you mentioned that.
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:22.000]  They used to have these payday loan laws, especially in the South, left over from the end of the Civil War.
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:28.000]  And now they allow like 20%, 30% interest in stuff a year just ripping people off.
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:34.000]  I mean, it is shameful what Congress, but also these states have been doing, so I commend you for that.
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:41.000]  Bottom line, we've got a shot at at least wounding him politically and scaring him to back off.
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:44.000]  But I think from other folks I've talked to, and correct me if I'm wrong, Congressman,
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:49.000]  we're pretty close to actually being able to unseat Boehner if the people get behind this.
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:56.000]  Alex, if the people would get behind this and call their member of Congress during this next three to four weeks,
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:05.000]  tell them about age resolution 385 and ask that member of Congress to join those of us who have put our necks out there
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:10.000]  and say that we need to return the House of Representatives to the people of America.
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:13.000]  That's why Donald Trump is so popular.
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:22.000]  I mean, really, people are frustrated and fed up and most of that frustration and being fed up is with Washington DC.
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:26.000]  And then he acts like he's from the outside and they start worshiping him.
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000]  I mean, I like a lot of the stuff he's actually saying.
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:35.000]  My only concern is, is the fact that he wouldn't like that in the past, but people change.
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000]  I'll give him the benefit of the doubt. Let me ask you that question.
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:41.000]  What do you think is going to happen to Trump if he runs third party and helps Hillary win,
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:45.000]  or if he drops out and plays hanky-panky?
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:48.000]  I hope he realizes that he is going to be anathema.
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:53.000]  Well, let me say up front, I have already endorsed Rand Paul. That's my choice.
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:59.000]  And the only thing I was trying to make the point with Donald Trump is that the frustration is deep.
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:04.000]  The frustration is so deep that, and I can say Bernie Sanders, look at the crowd he's drawing.
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:07.000]  He's just tired and fed up.
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:14.000]  And one way we can change the direction of the, this direction is to replace the speaker of the House.
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:20.000]  Again, if your listeners will follow your call and my call and pick up the phone,
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:27.000]  call them members of Congress, H resolution 385, and let's return the House back to the people of America.
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:32.000]  I agree, Congressman. In the three or four minutes we have left, I just want to make the point again,
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:36.000]  before we get into the situation with 28 pages, we have some breaking news there,
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:41.000]  that basically getting a good speaker would be like winning the White House.
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:45.000]  The Congress controls the purse, it controls what bills can move.
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:50.000]  The reason they're able to get this agenda through is they have Republican leadership working with the Democrats.
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:55.000]  This is as big as the election, removing Boehner and getting somebody good in there.
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:26:00.000]  And I think to get rid of him, we need a few members of the House to stand up and say,
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:03.000]  I want to be elected and this is what I'll do.
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:08.000]  I think if people challenge him and we get the leadership to not just go after him,
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:12.000]  but people say, you know, here's a field of folks, here's what we pledge to do,
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:17.000]  maybe a coalition of 10 members of the House to say, any of us could be speaker, vote for us,
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:22.000]  here's our pledge, then you'd see a grassroots movement and we can unseat him.
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:25.000]  So hopefully you've been moving the ball. What do you think of that idea, sir?
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:30.000]  Well, I think it's a great idea. The one thing that you know and I know,
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:34.000]  if anyone that would like to offer themselves as a speaker,
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:41.000]  they want to know that they can win this first step and the first step is to vacate the chair.
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:46.000]  So you have to at least get introduced to open the idea of being able to have the vote.
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:53.000]  No, absolutely. If we had this vote on the floor of the House and there would be people that would be smelling the blood,
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:58.000]  so to speak, they would start offering themselves up as a possibility.
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:04.000]  I think there would be at least three, four or five, if they thought that Bainer was going to be taken out of office,
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:07.000]  they would offer themselves. It would happen that quick.
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:11.000]  So it's like fishing for sharks. We got to get him on the line with the vacate, the chair boat,
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000]  then we can haul him in and gaffe him.
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:14.000]  There you go.
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:21.000]  In closing, sir, shifting gears into your dangerous and valiant move that's now exposed
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:26.000]  and headlines all over the world with other members of the House that saw the Arabia quarterback 9-11.
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:30.000]  You've seen the pages. Now more of this is coming out.
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:37.000]  U.S. ex-intelligence chief came out and said on ISIS's rise, it was a willful Washington decision to back him against Assad.
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:43.000]  Now Jeb Bush is saying and Obama is saying they're going to start bombing Assad to, quote, stop ISIS.
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:46.000]  That's the craziest thing I ever heard. What's your view on that?
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:59.000]  I agree with you totally. And if my brother had sent 4,000 Americans to die in an unnecessary war, I don't believe I'd be making those statements.
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:06.000]  I'm talking about George Bush going into Iraq. We never had to go into Iraq. It was a matter of fact that intelligence.
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.000]  Sure. And Jeb, it first defended it. Remember that?
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:16.000]  Oh, yeah, I do. I'm being kind of rude, but I'm going to tell you, we had no business going into Iraq.
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:21.000]  Taking out Saddam is part of the problem that we've got with the Middle East right now.
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:26.000]  Well, sure. Look at what we've got is Saudi Arabia, again, with its proxy army taking over.
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:32.000]  And now the White House has announced bombing of Assad who's fighting the Saudi Arabian proxy army.
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:41.000]  Well, Alex, that's why Jim McGovern and I and Barbara Lee have been pushing John Boehner to let us have a new debate and vote on the authorization of military force.
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:51.000]  They complain about Obama this and Obama that, but they'll let him go just decide whatever he wants to do to expand the war without any action of Congress.
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:29:00.000]  And Madison said it is the legislative branch that will debate and discuss the justification for war.
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:06.000]  Yes, sir. Well, again, everybody's got to get behind this. People want to spend all their time about the election.
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:12.000]  That's fine. Controlling the House, getting a Patriot in. That is the key. We've got good men and women up there.
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:21.000]  Let's do it. Let's get behind it. Thank you so much, Congressman Walter Jones, jones.house.gov, and give folks that resolution number one more time.
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:24.000]  The H-Resolution 385.
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000]  385. Thank you so much.
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:27.000]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000]  Please come back soon, sir. Thank you.
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.000]  Thank you. Bye bye.
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:36.000]  All right. God bless Walter Jones. Let me tell you, that guy is soft-spoken, but he's a real patriot and a real man.
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:30:02.000]  What he's doing is very dangerous. Very, very dangerous. You need to pray for him.
[01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:17.000]  Thank you.
[01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:44.000]  Thank you.
[01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:51.000]  Please come back soon.
[01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:24.000]  Thank you.
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:54.000]  Thank you so much.

[01:33:43.000 --> 01:34:12.000]  Thank you.
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:22.000]  Thank you so much.
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:35:02.000]  Thank you.
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:30.000]  Thank you.
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:50.000]  Thank you.
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:36:19.000]  Thank you.
[01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:45.000]  Thank you.
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:37:12.000]  Thank you.
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:38.000]  Thank you.

[01:37:53.000 --> 01:38:20.000]  Thank you.

[01:39:41.000 --> 01:40:09.000]  Thank you.
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:35.000]  Thank you.
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:41:02.000]  Thank you.
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:30.000]  Thank you.
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:59.000]  Thank you.
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:26.000]  Thank you.

[02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:51.000]  Thank you.
[02:10:51.000 --> 02:11:19.000]  Thank you.
[02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:46.000]  Thank you.
