[00:00.000 --> 00:11.560]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.560 --> 00:19.080]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.080 --> 00:31.240]  Texas Alex Jones well today is the day the beginning of the rest of your life
[00:31.240 --> 00:36.240]  the rest of my life the rest of all of our lives here on spaceship earth thank
[00:36.240 --> 00:43.000]  you so much for joining us it is September 12th 2011 I want to open the
[00:43.000 --> 00:48.560]  phones up again obviously we'll get into the nuclear weapons facility that had a
[00:48.560 --> 00:54.720]  big explosion at it in France more and more radiological disasters Japan Canada
[00:54.720 --> 01:02.960]  the US France we learned now that in the 50s they had a big reactor blow up in
[01:02.960 --> 01:10.760]  CME Valley worse than Chernobyl I'm all about technology but these companies
[01:10.760 --> 01:16.640]  obviously don't know how to operate these systems safely and they are using
[01:16.640 --> 01:21.440]  old 30 40 50-year-old systems and never upgrading and they're just melting down
[01:21.440 --> 01:25.000]  exploding all over the place and leaking and I've had enough of it and their
[01:25.000 --> 01:29.560]  answer is to have George Monbiot on the left come out here in Fukushima and say
[01:29.560 --> 01:35.760]  why Fukushima made me love nuclear just a weird psychological warfare thing
[01:35.760 --> 01:39.280]  where you catch somebody in bed with your wife or catch somebody you know
[01:39.280 --> 01:42.560]  hacking your child's head in with an axe and they say don't you want to thank me
[01:42.560 --> 01:47.440]  isn't it nice don't you love me see it's all psychological warfare in your
[01:47.440 --> 01:51.980]  face just to dominate you yeah the TSA is going in your pants yeah we're
[01:51.980 --> 01:54.720]  setting up checkpoints you taking your blood without a warrant yeah we're band
[01:54.720 --> 02:01.040]  and lemonade stands and gardens in your yard you got a problem with it huh we
[02:01.040 --> 02:06.560]  rule you period that's what mommy I came out and said I like radiation it's
[02:06.560 --> 02:11.680]  good and then culture said the Japanese ought to be thankful they've already had
[02:11.680 --> 02:15.160]  deaths over there they've got radiation poisoning millions of people the
[02:15.160 --> 02:19.240]  prime ministers had to resign they knew within a week that five of the six
[02:19.240 --> 02:23.760]  reactors totally melted down and blew up I watched the video of it blowing their
[02:23.760 --> 02:28.000]  reactors thousands of feet in the sky you bet it was a big explosion total
[02:28.000 --> 02:33.160]  breach radiation raining down now for six months here in the US milk food all
[02:33.160 --> 02:36.800]  radiation government just raises the level of what they say safe and now
[02:36.800 --> 02:42.200]  they've got a mox reactor system where they're turning hydrogen bombs into fuel
[02:42.200 --> 02:48.400]  for mox reactors like the one that blew up Fukushima 3 that's so nutritious for
[02:48.400 --> 02:55.800]  us and it's raining down on us it's just incredible explosion at French nuclear
[02:55.800 --> 03:01.160]  site kills one no leak just like Japan said there's no leak turned out the whole
[03:01.160 --> 03:05.040]  time they were lying oh keep the schools open three miles away everything's fine
[03:05.040 --> 03:08.960]  oh you're turning red and vomiting and your teeth are falling out well that's
[03:08.960 --> 03:14.120]  all right it's good for you and culture says the Japanese ought to be thankful
[03:14.120 --> 03:19.080]  she actually said oh this is the thing you ought to be thankful the troops
[03:19.080 --> 03:25.040]  Pentagon wouldn't let him use the plated uranium until 21 years ago they had the
[03:25.040 --> 03:31.320]  stuff in the 50s they had it in the armories along the line with Eastern
[03:31.320 --> 03:34.800]  Europe in case the Russians invaded as an emergency weapon but they did
[03:34.800 --> 03:38.280]  something in 1991 they just said you know we're gonna start using this and now
[03:38.280 --> 03:43.040]  they just say use it everywhere no decontamination you let them use it at
[03:43.040 --> 03:47.280]  proving grounds and firing ranges all over the US but let the troops breathe it
[03:47.280 --> 03:54.160]  every time you fire whether it's a 223 308 50 cal and right on up to Abrams
[03:54.160 --> 04:00.600]  sabos just go ahead and breathe it in an ignite so that one goes up the barrel
[04:00.600 --> 04:05.640]  and you get a death dose of it and it's just revel in death rebel and evil let's
[04:05.640 --> 04:12.040]  be honest about the insanity of the elites another nuclear disaster and now
[04:12.040 --> 04:15.880]  it's just like well that's what we do
[04:16.160 --> 04:21.840]  Chernobyl alone doubled the level of radiation in the northern hemisphere
[04:21.840 --> 04:30.200]  south of the equator they have half the radiation that we do because the winds
[04:30.200 --> 04:36.240]  go in circles and really don't go south one event doubled the background
[04:36.240 --> 04:40.720]  radiation and now just blowing up here blowing up there oh everything's
[04:40.720 --> 04:43.800]  wonderful we'll raise the level of radioactive isotopes we say safe a
[04:43.800 --> 04:47.200]  thousand times for this isotope how about a hundred thousand times for this
[04:47.200 --> 04:52.880]  one how about 25,000 times for that one all right I look uh we'll be right back
[04:52.880 --> 04:57.040]  we'll be right back stay with me info orange nightly news coming up tonight
[04:57.040 --> 05:04.640]  seven o'clock a very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will
[05:04.640 --> 05:08.960]  witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years he says it
[05:08.960 --> 05:13.080]  will change everything about our lives the way you shop travel invest educate
[05:13.080 --> 05:16.480]  your children and even how you take care of your health and your own family now
[05:16.480 --> 05:19.880]  this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years the crazy
[05:19.880 --> 05:23.920]  part is he's usually right you see he predicted the collapse of GM
[05:23.920 --> 05:27.160]  panty may Freddie Mac and America's biggest mall owner general growth
[05:27.160 --> 05:32.000]  properties in fact Barron's called his work a dire prophecy recently he
[05:32.000 --> 05:35.480]  created a video which you can watch online for free detailing his biggest
[05:35.480 --> 05:39.480]  and most important prediction yet and it's a real eye-opener I can't stress
[05:39.480 --> 05:42.880]  this enough you should at least watch this free video online today he
[05:42.880 --> 05:46.080]  explains everything you need to know including simple steps you can take to
[05:46.080 --> 05:52.000]  protect yourself you can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com that's end
[05:52.000 --> 05:57.800]  of America the number 3.com watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com
[05:57.800 --> 06:02.040]  that's end of America 3.com this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you
[06:02.040 --> 06:05.920]  should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate
[06:05.920 --> 06:09.640]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our
[06:09.640 --> 06:13.640]  new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[06:13.640 --> 06:18.000]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[06:18.000 --> 06:22.440]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[06:22.440 --> 06:27.200]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[06:27.200 --> 06:31.000]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[06:31.000 --> 06:34.600]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[06:34.600 --> 06:38.960]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[06:38.960 --> 06:42.120]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[06:42.120 --> 06:45.800]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[06:45.800 --> 06:50.560]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar
[06:50.560 --> 06:54.800]  backup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to my solar
[06:54.800 --> 07:01.760]  backup.com or call 1-877-327-0365 hello friends Alex Jones here you all know
[07:01.760 --> 07:05.760]  I've worked for years with Steve Shank and E-Foods Direct I have E-Foods for my
[07:05.760 --> 07:09.760]  own emergency food supply you know Steve life is different now for all of us
[07:09.760 --> 07:13.440]  isn't it very different people are using this great food to survive the
[07:13.440 --> 07:17.680]  present hurricane season and we've already had 40 billion dollars worth of
[07:17.680 --> 07:22.240]  damage from floods storms quakes and droughts and that's just the first eight
[07:22.240 --> 07:26.560]  months of this year natural disasters are newsworthy but only touch a few of us
[07:26.560 --> 07:31.200]  Americans the huge issue of the greatest depression is on everyone's mind the
[07:31.200 --> 07:35.520]  unemployment the loss of homes lost businesses and skyrocketing food costs
[07:35.520 --> 07:40.240]  are hitting every American so everyone needs food security folks this month you
[07:40.240 --> 07:43.640]  will get free shipping on every food order from E-Foods Direct that's right
[07:43.640 --> 07:47.320]  every order gets free shipping starting September 6th get stocked up with the
[07:47.320 --> 07:50.880]  best orderable foods out there with E-Foods Direct and be prepared for any

[08:00.720 --> 08:12.600]  ease the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network well
[08:12.600 --> 08:17.360]  George Mombiat on the controlled globalist left should be very happy and
[08:17.360 --> 08:20.960]  and culture on the controlled globalist right that's how the keep us all in the
[08:20.960 --> 08:25.920]  reservation should be pleased both of them praised Fukushima and said that
[08:25.920 --> 08:31.080]  radiation is no longer a health issue that's the new spin why Fukushima made
[08:31.080 --> 08:36.720]  me stop worrying about and love nuclear power again why Fukushima made me stop
[08:36.720 --> 08:41.920]  worrying and love nuclear power Japan's disaster would weigh more heavily if
[08:41.920 --> 08:46.440]  there were less harmful alternatives atomic power is part of the mix that's a
[08:46.440 --> 08:50.160]  guy who openly calls for world government an authoritative world
[08:50.160 --> 08:54.080]  government but also criticizes those that don't want one as being delusional
[08:54.080 --> 08:58.240]  and you can also pull up the end culture what was the headline and culture
[08:58.240 --> 09:02.360]  says Japanese should be thankful for radiation and says that it will help
[09:02.360 --> 09:07.160]  their health now the reason I raise this out of the gates on this September 12th
[09:07.160 --> 09:13.040]  2011 10 years and one day after the tragic event the reason I raise this up
[09:13.040 --> 09:19.000]  front is we are seeing disasters all the time now that in the aggregate are
[09:19.000 --> 09:24.720]  going to be much much worse for human life in 911 the United Nations own
[09:24.720 --> 09:27.440]  estimations and I've talked to top scientists I've looked at the numbers
[09:27.440 --> 09:34.360]  it's probably a conservative estimate is that a million people in the decades
[09:34.360 --> 09:43.600]  since Chernobyl in 1986 that a million people have died from complications
[09:43.600 --> 09:52.080]  directly linked to the meltdown at that reactor an explosion that spewed radioactive
[09:52.080 --> 09:59.120]  isotopes in all different directions now it's been estimated that and we had
[09:59.120 --> 10:03.520]  different physicists and radiologists on but it's been estimated that the five
[10:03.520 --> 10:07.120]  reactors all of which were many times bigger than Chernobyl that completely
[10:07.120 --> 10:12.200]  exploded and melted down each one could have spewed more than 10 times the
[10:12.200 --> 10:18.840]  radiation of Fukushima this is a big big deal but meanwhile it isn't an issue
[10:18.840 --> 10:24.680]  because it doesn't instantly kill you it doesn't instantly kill you yes there's
[10:24.680 --> 10:28.720]  been radiation sickness yes there's been deaths connected to people from
[10:28.720 --> 10:32.800]  radiation sickness that's in Japanese news but it's still a minor footnote
[10:32.800 --> 10:38.400]  the Japanese are so culturally tough that you're not supposed to even complain
[10:38.400 --> 10:42.480]  especially if it's seen as part of a shared disaster and there have been some
[10:42.480 --> 10:46.600]  suicides of prominent officials and a lot of resignations of physicists who
[10:46.600 --> 10:50.280]  lied for the government and the prime minister and and so they are actually
[10:50.280 --> 10:53.520]  punishing people and they're talking about criminal charges because they
[10:53.520 --> 10:57.080]  didn't want to cause a panic they say so they lied and so there's there's no
[10:57.080 --> 11:00.880]  radiation and I noticed in those three prefectures around Fukushima those three
[11:00.880 --> 11:05.280]  states it would just say for months not recording not reporting levels of
[11:05.280 --> 11:11.800]  radiation but we knew from groups picking up radioactive isotopes
[11:11.800 --> 11:15.360]  universities here in the US and even Europe that there were isotopes that
[11:15.360 --> 11:24.160]  are only released when vision is achieved when when there is a chain
[11:24.160 --> 11:30.720]  reaction a limited chain reaction but still a chain reaction and so the worst
[11:30.720 --> 11:35.160]  type of disaster because a atomic bomb or a hydrogen bomb unless it's a dirty
[11:35.160 --> 11:41.640]  bomb jacketed in cobalt or other things it dissipates almost all of its
[11:41.640 --> 11:46.520]  radiation instantly there's some fallout but it's still very limited but a
[11:46.520 --> 11:52.800]  reactor melting down is the equivalent of a giant dirty bomb times a million you
[11:52.800 --> 12:00.320]  can look it up just one event chair noble
[12:00.320 --> 12:08.600]  conservatively doubled the background radiation in the northern hemisphere of
[12:08.600 --> 12:14.200]  the planet earth below that equator they have half the radiation background
[12:14.200 --> 12:20.200]  from just one event because the jet streams and trade winds circle the
[12:20.200 --> 12:24.440]  earth and don't ever really get down south it's like a lot of the the the
[12:24.440 --> 12:27.240]  weather patterns from the south don't make it to the north they got some
[12:27.240 --> 12:32.600]  radiation increase can you imagine what this is going to do but see and here's
[12:32.600 --> 12:37.360]  the the the heart of the matter an illustration because it kills you
[12:37.360 --> 12:42.480]  slowly it's out of sight out of mind and the globalists understand this people
[12:42.480 --> 12:49.120]  don't get upset about poison being put in the well that kills you 20 years
[12:49.120 --> 12:52.720]  later now there would be a panic if you drank the well water and died in five
[12:52.720 --> 12:59.760]  minutes so if something soft kills you or slow kills you it's like it never
[12:59.760 --> 13:04.200]  happened just like cigarettes or any other issue so everybody's fear
[13:04.200 --> 13:09.360]  mongering total change in culture total fear checkpoints all over the country
[13:09.360 --> 13:13.680]  children being trained to spy on their parents absolute abject complete
[13:13.680 --> 13:22.160]  hysteria boogie men are under every table got to give your rights up but
[13:22.160 --> 13:26.000]  but but historically and statistically in common sense people aren't fearing
[13:26.000 --> 13:29.880]  what can really ruin their life and take your property and constrict your
[13:29.880 --> 13:33.360]  children and that's government government's killed always say 200
[13:33.360 --> 13:36.840]  million I've been corrected all together it's about 300 million that's
[13:36.840 --> 13:44.200]  confirmed in the 20th century 300 million directly murdered by government
[13:44.200 --> 13:50.120]  300 million that's a lot scarier than al-qaeda even if you believe they
[13:50.120 --> 13:57.920]  actually carried out 9-11 ended 300 million dead now a million dead 20 plus
[13:57.920 --> 14:07.920]  years later from the effects of Chernobyl but things were different back
[14:07.920 --> 14:11.680]  in the day at Chernobyl the US Army wouldn't use DU wouldn't give its troops
[14:11.680 --> 14:17.520]  a delayed soft kill death sentence Europeans were advised and for six
[14:17.520 --> 14:21.760]  months the importation of food was a must no milk was allowed to be consumed
[14:21.760 --> 14:25.920]  the animals were tested and slaughtered and not allowed to be used even as
[14:25.920 --> 14:32.200]  animal feed it'll be put into dog food and things and the milk powder milk was
[14:32.200 --> 14:36.120]  brought in and vegetables were frozen and brought in for six months and the
[14:36.120 --> 14:39.880]  soil was tested and finally they said okay you know there's a certain range
[14:39.880 --> 14:43.880]  around Chernobyl you can't eat but all over Europe from Italy to the Netherlands
[14:43.880 --> 14:50.320]  people did not eat milk drink milk that was produced there did not eat
[14:50.320 --> 14:54.440]  vegetables that was produced there because they understood how serious it
[14:54.440 --> 14:59.440]  was especially with children because they have fast-growing cells and there's a
[14:59.440 --> 15:04.080]  much much greater effect on fast-growing cells with radiation than there is on
[15:04.080 --> 15:11.640]  cells that are not fast-growing now and obviously a child is still has a lot
[15:11.640 --> 15:17.520]  more fast-growing cells than an adult now we are hit being hit with levels of
[15:17.520 --> 15:21.120]  radiation comparable to what southern Europe in the opposite direction of the
[15:21.120 --> 15:24.320]  plume got you can go pull up the actuaries on this universities have put
[15:24.320 --> 15:27.320]  out we've written articles about it linked to other articles on info wars
[15:27.320 --> 15:32.200]  dot-com and prison planet dot-com what has changed in the mindset of the
[15:32.200 --> 15:37.240]  globalist where they just don't care they don't care anymore about themselves
[15:37.240 --> 15:43.280]  about anybody else it is a death cult it is a cult of lunatics all of their
[15:43.280 --> 15:47.320]  open-air genetically modified crops that are pharmacological that are so
[15:47.320 --> 15:52.440]  deadly and spreading into other other crops splicing animals insects into
[15:52.440 --> 15:58.120]  crops and then splicing that crop into animals and vice versa hundreds of
[15:58.120 --> 16:03.520]  cross-PC splices in one organism hundreds of insects fish and
[16:03.520 --> 16:11.600]  fibian reptile all being injected into different animals all being created now
[16:11.600 --> 16:16.360]  allowing cross species jumping of zoological diseases I mean this is
[16:16.360 --> 16:21.760]  Armageddon type stuff ticking time bomb already increasing cancers already
[16:21.760 --> 16:27.280]  increasing infertility in all the studies run-of-the-mill single trait GMOs
[16:27.280 --> 16:31.880]  within three generations are sterilizing all rats all mice all getting pigs now
[16:31.880 --> 16:38.120]  they're coming out on the market with seven stack 10 stack 20 stack 20 different
[16:38.120 --> 16:41.960]  traits engineered into stuff you're eating it's devastating but with rats
[16:41.960 --> 16:45.440]  you can see it in a few months in the cycles with humans it takes 20 years
[16:45.440 --> 16:50.240]  you already see devastation 20 years into this imagine 20 years from now it is
[16:50.240 --> 16:54.280]  going to be children of men almost complete infertility according to
[16:54.280 --> 16:58.360]  current growth rates I just got chills I just got chills we are in the middle of
[16:58.360 --> 17:03.640]  it's you know I don't believe like David Ike does it's really fourth
[17:03.640 --> 17:07.440]  dimensional you know space aliens that are that are manipulating humans to do
[17:07.440 --> 17:11.800]  this evil but I know and I'm not bashing David but I he's welcome to his
[17:11.800 --> 17:17.480]  theories but I understand why people want to believe that I mean how our own
[17:17.480 --> 17:23.000]  humans fouling their own nest destroying our own future and doing this
[17:23.000 --> 17:29.040]  what is wrong with the elites why are they doing this do they have super
[17:29.040 --> 17:34.880]  advanced technologies and they think they can reverse it and and the cherry on
[17:34.880 --> 17:39.320]  top what really makes it rich to the point of wanting to throw up is that
[17:39.320 --> 17:43.600]  then we get lectured by them all day about how bad humans are and how they
[17:43.600 --> 17:47.520]  want to tax carbon dioxide that the earth is very low in right now according
[17:47.520 --> 17:53.240]  to every swamp sample peat bog sample and ice core sample and they've got
[17:53.240 --> 17:57.960]  other ways they've got rock samples I mean it's been 14 times higher and
[17:57.960 --> 18:04.080]  more in just the last few hundred thousand years I mean we are we are we
[18:04.080 --> 18:08.400]  are carbon dioxide starved you double carbon dioxide and it would begin to
[18:08.400 --> 18:13.560]  green deserts every study shows plants live longer grow faster are healthier
[18:13.560 --> 18:18.000]  something weird is going on on this planet where where they're going after
[18:18.000 --> 18:23.280]  the one thing we need well meanwhile just running around destroying
[18:23.280 --> 18:26.640]  everything now now why did I get on this nuke rant and then I'll get into all
[18:26.640 --> 18:29.600]  the other news because big economic meltdowns we're going to 9-11 I won't
[18:29.600 --> 18:36.560]  open the phones up incredible Libby information this is what we need to get
[18:36.560 --> 18:41.240]  into okay I mean I mean here's the end culture in case because I say these
[18:41.240 --> 18:43.840]  things and then go people aren't going to believe it if their new listeners even
[18:43.840 --> 18:47.600]  though it was said publicly months ago so I had the guys pull it and culture
[18:47.600 --> 18:51.440]  talks Japan earthquake tsunami with Bill O'Reilly radiation is good for you
[18:51.440 --> 18:55.960]  New York Daily News she said the Japanese should be thankful to General
[18:55.960 --> 19:01.240]  Electric I mean it's now admitted quite a few are dying and others you know have
[19:01.240 --> 19:05.800]  fast cells dying their gums are bleeding their intestines are bleeding and she
[19:05.800 --> 19:10.520]  says they ought to be thankful and again we offered to pay her money to go and
[19:10.520 --> 19:15.640]  and speak at Fukushima by the way they got robots in there the highest
[19:15.640 --> 19:20.440]  radiation ever recorded you can pull this up is coming out of the mox
[19:20.440 --> 19:29.840]  reactor the highest ever recorded the highest radiation level on earth ever
[19:29.840 --> 19:34.200]  recorded is coming out of there they can they're calling the Fukushima 50 that
[19:34.200 --> 19:37.880]  are all died of radiation poisoning who went in they won't even work on it now
[19:37.880 --> 19:41.880]  it's already elective and she's running around saying it's fine and so is mom
[19:41.880 --> 19:45.280]  beyond mean well so they ought to be real happy here why don't we send and

[20:03.080 --> 20:07.000]  freely purchase dietary supplements over the counter are under constant attack

[20:15.280 --> 20:19.560]  products at a reasonable price even organic foods are stripped of nutrients

[24:33.280 --> 24:38.440]  healthy for you which again plays a mind game yes they can focus specific types
[24:38.440 --> 24:46.280]  of radiation beams add a tumor and knock it out and a lot of times it fries
[24:46.280 --> 24:51.200]  the tissues around it they were able to knock out my great uncles a pancreatic
[24:51.200 --> 24:56.840]  cancer with it but then it fried the tissues around it and ended up basically
[24:56.840 --> 25:04.640]  dying from complications from that later but yes a knife can be good to cut up
[25:04.640 --> 25:08.800]  carrots or to cut out a tumor that mean you want it stabbed right in your heart
[25:08.800 --> 25:14.080]  now there's the headline record high radiation at Japan nuke plant
[25:14.080 --> 25:20.880]  continuing with the latest radiological disaster and it but no it's almost like
[25:20.880 --> 25:25.320]  this is on purpose that's what dr. Busby who's been an advisor to the EU and the
[25:25.320 --> 25:32.960]  British government and the BBC he said it's almost like they're doing this on
[25:32.960 --> 25:37.360]  purpose because fertility has dropped in the northern hemisphere by more than
[25:37.360 --> 25:43.160]  80% and radiation is one of the main contributors to that and you know he
[25:43.160 --> 25:46.360]  talks to colleagues who are for nukes and they say oh well there's too many
[25:46.360 --> 25:50.280]  people it's kind of like that Russian scientist we interviewed years ago who
[25:50.280 --> 25:57.280]  was wow we've been feeding the rats this GMO based feed and within three
[25:57.280 --> 26:03.600]  generations they're all sterile and they just said don't worry about it don't
[26:03.600 --> 26:08.360]  worry about it there's too many people this is the attitude of a very small
[26:08.360 --> 26:14.440]  guild it's a control freak cult who realizes total power over the species is
[26:14.440 --> 26:21.040]  about fertility the species is about fertility the whole life cycle is about
[26:21.040 --> 26:24.520]  pushing the species forward building a better world for the next generation
[26:24.520 --> 26:29.040]  meeting a woman meeting a man getting married having children this is a war
[26:29.040 --> 26:35.560]  against creation by scientific technocrats that are playing God and
[26:35.560 --> 26:40.120]  they're building armored seed vaults and animal vaults with the DNA the eggs the
[26:40.120 --> 26:47.440]  sperm the seeds of every species on earth 14 UN funded facilities worldwide
[26:47.440 --> 26:53.640]  with Rockefeller Foundation protection most of them in high desert areas with
[26:53.640 --> 26:57.360]  armed guards others at the Arctic Circle don't believe me just type in UN seed
[26:57.360 --> 27:01.720]  vaults UN animal vaults underground bases with this stuff and that's just
[27:01.720 --> 27:06.080]  what we know about while the very people setting this up are running around
[27:06.080 --> 27:13.000]  funding the projects to wreck everything and see once they've wrecked the
[27:13.000 --> 27:16.560]  entire genome of every major species then there you're gonna have to go to
[27:16.560 --> 27:19.760]  them to reverse it you're gonna have to go to them to have a child and they're
[27:19.760 --> 27:23.560]  like oh fertility's gone now but don't worry we'll just take a cell from your
[27:23.560 --> 27:27.520]  husband a cell from your wife we'll splice it we'll engineer it and we'll get
[27:27.520 --> 27:32.160]  out any bad traits as well which will be traits of aggression resistance
[27:32.160 --> 27:36.400]  understanding and then because it's so specialized you won't know there's been
[27:36.400 --> 27:40.280]  backdoors built into the humanoid you call your son or daughter you're getting
[27:40.280 --> 27:45.240]  that you're paying for just like they've catch him in every major GMO and
[27:45.240 --> 27:50.800]  pharmacological crop building other things into it you're told oh this has
[27:50.800 --> 27:57.800]  this trait drought resistant but it's got another trait stacked and it's it's so
[27:57.800 --> 28:02.600]  specific there's only maybe less than a few dozen companies that can analyze it
[28:02.600 --> 28:07.480]  correctly and then you try to find out they say well it's proprietary you're
[28:07.480 --> 28:11.720]  not allowed to see what we're doing this is our company's product we're
[28:11.720 --> 28:15.880]  infecting everything with it but it's okay I mean we're living in a wild
[28:15.880 --> 28:22.560]  twilight zone movie and that the average male wants to sit in easy chair and
[28:22.560 --> 28:26.600]  drink beer and think that that's a manly like I see guys when they do that they
[28:26.600 --> 28:30.800]  like get off on it like it's really cool kind of like a kid put on a cowboy hat
[28:30.800 --> 28:34.840]  and fake six shooters you know you can see it's like dress up it's like fantasy
[28:34.840 --> 28:38.120]  you can see guys usually aren't even having fun doing this but it's like the
[28:38.120 --> 28:44.000]  they're having fun feeling like they're manly man men sit in a chair yeah that's
[28:44.000 --> 28:49.480]  what men do no men navigate boats around the world men climb mountains men
[28:49.480 --> 28:55.160]  develop new ideas and literature and discoveries men protect their families

[29:00.680 --> 29:07.120]  conned men aren't going to be suckered or gained men are wily

[33:58.040 --> 34:03.440]  were told Libby is over humanitarian disaster averted by killing 30,000
[34:03.440 --> 34:08.640]  people and bombing everything would do you here's AP Libyan fighters pushed
[34:08.640 --> 34:15.520]  stalled by Gaddafi troops and they haven't even taken all the Tripoli just
[34:15.520 --> 34:21.560]  it is a civil war but the average Americans like hey I'm not worried
[34:21.560 --> 34:26.200]  about radiation it's not in the news I'm not worried about what happened in
[34:26.200 --> 34:30.800]  Libya you know we were I've actually heard neo cons on radio talking about
[34:30.800 --> 34:34.880]  Gaddafi was with Al Qaeda ladies and gentlemen Gaddafi you say what you want
[34:34.880 --> 34:40.200]  about the guy Gaddafi effect later we you guys Reuters released it but it's
[34:40.200 --> 34:44.320]  it's Gaddafi's footage so we can show it him with his grandchildren just type
[34:44.320 --> 34:49.360]  in footage of Gaddafi with grandchildren released and you can see the
[34:49.360 --> 34:54.800]  footage but there is an attempt with plastic chairs and you know eating
[34:54.800 --> 34:59.280]  food out of a tin can in 2005 I mean they always said it was an act that he
[34:59.280 --> 35:05.120]  liked to stay intense no that's he came from a southern you know tribe of
[35:05.120 --> 35:10.560]  herders which what he was into and the point is is that he issued the first
[35:10.560 --> 35:17.320]  arrest warrant for Osama bin Laden through Interpol in 1996 and of course they
[35:17.320 --> 35:23.800]  just had him try to kill him there it is there's some there's some footage
[35:28.960 --> 35:39.120]  now continuing my point is is that I remember the news saying Libya was
[35:39.120 --> 35:43.240]  funding Al Qaeda that's not true remember hearing him say Iran is funding
[35:43.240 --> 35:50.680]  Al Qaeda Al Qaeda is out of Saudi Arabia and the Al Qaeda brand of Islam is the
[35:50.680 --> 35:56.240]  arch enemy of the Shiites they hate each other 100 times probably what they
[35:56.240 --> 36:00.440]  quote hate the great Satan West for any of those you know groups of Muslims that
[36:00.440 --> 36:05.720]  are you know on the extremist bandwagon most Muslims the Middle East I've
[36:05.720 --> 36:09.360]  talked to a lot of them and read their writings are sophisticated and actually
[36:09.360 --> 36:12.560]  understand all the manipulations and things that are going on and how groups
[36:12.560 --> 36:17.000]  are played off against each other it's not one monolithic group but our
[36:17.000 --> 36:22.320]  government our media when Tommy Franks and Cheney and Bush and all these groups
[36:22.320 --> 36:29.440]  say Iran is Al Qaeda Iran is attacked by Saudi Arabian funded groups those
[36:29.440 --> 36:33.920]  countries have been on the verge of war many times and are constantly arresting
[36:33.920 --> 36:39.520]  them and hanging them it's it's it's absolutely diametrically opposed groups
[36:39.520 --> 36:44.760]  that think the others are heretics okay now Qaddafi was a completely other
[36:44.760 --> 36:55.960]  brand but they're treating you like your complete and utter morons when they
[36:55.960 --> 37:02.560]  say that Qaddafi's Al Qaeda and Iran is Al Qaeda that's why
[37:02.560 --> 37:11.560]  that's why if you go back I don't know now five years ago Bush put out a press
[37:11.560 --> 37:15.240]  release White House.gov saying we are funding and authorizing these four
[37:15.240 --> 37:19.000]  groups to attack inside Iran there was a big deal in the media they're like wow
[37:19.000 --> 37:22.920]  they admit that the US is funding terror groups to attack Iranians and three of
[37:22.920 --> 37:27.000]  the four groups one of them was Kurd group but the others were all all
[37:27.000 --> 37:32.880]  Wahhabist and an actual real Al Qaeda and now they're using those very groups
[37:32.880 --> 37:38.040]  out of Iraq to turn over control of Libya to them and that's who now is the
[37:38.040 --> 37:42.240]  main rebel leader of the entire operations sitting in Tripoli admits he
[37:42.240 --> 37:48.840]  is Al Qaeda and works with the people and is made up of groups that have
[37:48.840 --> 37:53.840]  actually attacked US soldiers in Iraq but see that's why Muhammad Karzai
[37:53.840 --> 37:58.160]  four or five years ago it's a famous case you put the video to the press
[37:58.160 --> 38:02.880]  conference at the Rose Garden at the White House and Bush says well Karzai's
[38:02.880 --> 38:07.520]  fighting Iran really hard Iran is attacking with Al Qaeda and we're going
[38:07.520 --> 38:10.360]  to deal with them and he said respectfully Mr. President your
[38:10.360 --> 38:15.240]  Excellency as they say obnoxiously you know some of the people to you and call
[38:15.240 --> 38:20.480]  our Presidents Excellency that calling him your highness use respectfully sir I
[38:20.480 --> 38:24.680]  must explain Iran is helping us with Al Qaeda they are aligned with a
[38:24.680 --> 38:28.640]  different group sir because he knew in the Middle East Central Asia this was
[38:28.640 --> 38:33.360]  like saying Bill Clinton is Abraham Lincoln or it's like saying the Dallas
[38:33.360 --> 38:38.840]  Cowboys are the Seattle Seahawks it's just it's ridiculous it'd be like if
[38:38.840 --> 38:43.480]  Karzai came here and said I really love your Dallas Redskins and the president
[38:43.480 --> 38:50.760]  say President Karzai that's the Dallas Cowboys or it'd be like if Karzai came
[38:50.760 --> 38:56.480]  and said I love your American movie with lax Luther in the red Kate no no no
[38:56.480 --> 39:00.760]  that's Superman I mean it's that ridiculous and he goes respectfully sir
[39:00.760 --> 39:04.560]  there that that is the opposite group they are helping us and Bush is like no
[39:04.560 --> 39:10.480]  no they are Al Qaeda and he goes yes sir knowing it was all over the Middle
[39:10.480 --> 39:15.360]  East and Central Asia broadcasting and was just ridiculous it'd be like the
[39:15.360 --> 39:19.280]  president getting up and saying the Stay Puff Marshmallow Man is real I mean
[39:19.280 --> 39:27.400]  it's just beyond idiocy but see Bush knew what he was doing Tommy Franks knew
[39:27.400 --> 39:33.640]  he got in trouble for it Rumsfeld's done it they all say well Al Qaeda were
[39:33.640 --> 39:37.520]  fighting him in Iran and then the media is always but sir that's their arch
[39:37.520 --> 39:44.200]  enemy there they're fighting each other you know Hezbollah and Hamas represented
[39:44.200 --> 39:48.400]  Hezbollah out of Iran Hamas founded and run by Israel as the quote
[39:48.400 --> 39:52.960]  counterbalance and again it's the Wahhabist you got to understand Israel
[39:52.960 --> 39:56.600]  Saudi Arabia the United States all the people running our countries are all
[39:56.600 --> 40:01.160]  on the same team and so that's why they use these Wahhabist double agents to
[40:01.160 --> 40:05.280]  carry out dirty work and sometimes even burn Patsy's like a McVeigh or Lee
[40:05.280 --> 40:10.600]  Harvey Oswald they just so happen to have a turban in a big beard and sometimes
[40:10.600 --> 40:14.760]  they actually fund people who are real terrorists and think they're doing it for
[40:14.760 --> 40:20.960]  Islam but see I'm already digressing again it is just so amazing on the Libyan
[40:20.960 --> 40:27.120]  front Libyan fighters pushed all by Qaddafi troops I thought I thought three
[40:27.120 --> 40:31.320]  weeks ago it was all over the television said so I thought Qaddafi'd run to
[40:31.320 --> 40:36.680]  Venezuela five months ago I mean must be true and and culture says radiation is
[40:36.680 --> 40:40.680]  good for you so I mean I'm not gonna be a conspiracy terrorist because
[40:40.680 --> 40:46.440]  questioning anything a mainstream media figure says is sacrilege it is it is
[40:46.440 --> 40:54.160]  blasphemy it is heretical so I'm in fact I refuse to even see this AP
[40:54.160 --> 40:59.040]  article because this contradicts what I've been told so what a but but wait
[40:59.040 --> 41:04.680]  AP is the boss so what do I believe Libyan fighters pushed all by Qaddafi
[41:04.680 --> 41:10.960]  troops fierce resistance by loyalists and stretched and strongholds and it's
[41:10.960 --> 41:14.720]  it's you know they've been pushing for final control forever here's another one
[41:14.720 --> 41:20.880]  official it's now official Qaddafi son Al Said the shield has fled to Niger
[41:20.880 --> 41:24.960]  obviously so he has better command and control over their rebel forces that's
[41:24.960 --> 41:29.320]  a good move to divide their command structure again I'm no fan of these
[41:29.320 --> 41:33.840]  people not a fan of government period I'm just telling you to blame him and
[41:33.840 --> 41:37.920]  say he's al Qaeda when they actually fought al Qaeda and then our own stinking
[41:37.920 --> 41:41.760]  murderous criminal banker occupied government is putting them in and now
[41:41.760 --> 41:46.440]  they admit he's seeking missiles have gotten in their hands by the way I saw
[41:46.440 --> 41:49.080]  it in court documents months ago people were like where's your proof where's your
[41:49.080 --> 41:52.400]  proof well we have an info wars article we wrote with links to mainstream news
[41:52.400 --> 41:57.720]  where it indeed fast and furious ship guns in Chicago and in the Indiana you
[41:57.720 --> 42:02.640]  can go pull that up I didn't yes yes the government ships guns to drug gangs in
[42:02.640 --> 42:08.780]  America okay the government isn't the government it's hijacked I mean if
[42:08.780 --> 42:12.960]  somebody carjacked your you in your garage you open your garage if you're
[42:12.960 --> 42:18.000]  getting in a guy jumps in puts a gun to your head do you do you go into the
[42:18.000 --> 42:26.160]  what's that psychological phenomenon where you love your oppressors and and
[42:26.160 --> 42:28.960]  and more and more people go into this because we've been trained to be so
[42:28.960 --> 42:33.480]  cowardly people actually play a mind game with themselves Stockholm syndrome
[42:33.480 --> 42:37.640]  and they go into Stockholm syndrome so the guy gets in and says I'm carjacking
[42:37.640 --> 42:41.640]  you do you decide they're like your boss and go well let me show fur you from
[42:41.640 --> 42:45.600]  now on and then and then if anybody tried to get the the carjacker out of the
[42:45.600 --> 42:49.720]  car you might fight them you're like no this is you know this is the government
[42:49.720 --> 42:53.480]  I mean if some crazy man climbed the fence at the White House and could jump
[42:53.480 --> 42:58.200]  on TV during a live telecast and say I'm the president well you sat in the
[42:58.200 --> 43:03.560]  president's chair you're the president now we've got to do everything you say
[43:03.560 --> 43:08.840]  I've got to do some searching I saw it Friday night and it never searched it
[43:08.840 --> 43:17.320]  because I've been so busy but but on on MSNBC they now I guess work because I
[43:17.320 --> 43:20.880]  don't really watch a lot TV they rear 60 minutes and I think was about nine at
[43:20.880 --> 43:25.000]  night and I turn on I want to get some propaganda I want to see what they're up
[43:25.000 --> 43:31.600]  to so I go to MSNBC in there Aaron 60 minutes and it was it was so amazing but
[43:31.600 --> 43:36.040]  I was over my parents house and so I didn't record it couldn't figure out a
[43:36.040 --> 43:40.520]  record it by the time I saw it and it was what I've seen all the manuals that
[43:40.520 --> 43:43.520]  we've put in films and talked about and some of the training videos but it was
[43:43.520 --> 43:47.840]  worse it showed the Pentagon funding seminars in every police department in
[43:47.840 --> 43:54.520]  the country including corporations now and infregard with these army colonels
[43:54.520 --> 44:02.360]  some retired some not who look completely insane but very charismatic with
[44:02.360 --> 44:07.160]  cops who look like they've been put in microwave ovens I mean you could tell
[44:07.160 --> 44:10.720]  they've done 10 15 cycles of Roids where it was just all kind of like blubber now
[44:10.720 --> 44:14.000]  and it showed all these crazy-looking Roid head cops it looked like they were
[44:14.000 --> 44:21.280]  out of their minds and women cops and people and it showed them and they were
[44:21.280 --> 44:29.880]  saying yes Al Qaeda will attack every single police station and school they
[44:29.880 --> 44:33.960]  will attack me I will be attacked Al Qaeda will attack you and it cuts the
[44:33.960 --> 44:38.600]  Pentagon funded group saying everyone will be attacked you will be attacked and
[44:38.600 --> 44:42.200]  and of course it's domestic groups see they're moving away from Al Qaeda now
[44:42.200 --> 44:45.880]  they're saying people are gonna attack you everywhere and I guess as the
[44:45.880 --> 44:50.200]  government tries to take everybody's property and checkpoints and people get
[44:50.200 --> 44:52.960]  mad because their pension funds are being taken there probably are gonna be
[44:52.960 --> 44:57.480]  some people to get angry so they're getting ready for 1776 and they're the
[44:57.480 --> 45:01.680]  redcoats and they're actually up there though teaching them to be totally
[45:01.680 --> 45:05.360]  fearful and freaked out and it showed these cops completely glassy eyed
[45:05.360 --> 45:11.120]  roided out of their minds who could barely talk going I think he's great
[45:11.120 --> 45:18.040]  they're trying to keep me safe from the terrorist I mean it was like whoa whoa
[45:18.040 --> 45:24.000]  I mean this is a self-fulfilling delusional prophecy where the cops I
[45:24.000 --> 45:27.240]  mean I saw the foot I was watching more news this weekend I normally do because of
[45:27.240 --> 45:31.800]  the the 10th anniversary celebration of fear and the death of liberty in America
[45:31.800 --> 45:35.240]  that's what it's turned into is like a you know the day they killed America but
[45:35.240 --> 45:39.760]  America's a spirit so we can always breathe life back into it but but
[45:39.760 --> 45:44.400]  America's dead it's over goose is cooked long time ago you got to be honest
[45:44.400 --> 45:50.640]  about that to get it back and I'm watching and it was like checkpoints in
[45:50.640 --> 45:56.040]  Dallas checkpoints in Los Angeles checkpoints in Boston Detroit Michigan
[45:56.040 --> 46:02.280]  New York Washington DC and it just showed random troops out searching
[46:02.280 --> 46:08.240]  people's cars army cops in battle gear with guns strapped to their legs m16s
[46:08.240 --> 46:12.480]  and looking all scared and imagine women and children are walking around and
[46:12.480 --> 46:17.600]  there's cops with machine guns whoo whoo terrorist everywhere buddy let's say
[46:17.600 --> 46:21.360]  there was gonna be a real car bombing or something this week or I mean
[46:21.360 --> 46:24.640]  statistically you've got a better chance of being struck by lightning dying from
[46:24.640 --> 46:28.560]  honeybee when a honeybee flies by you do you do you just run and cower and fear
[46:28.560 --> 46:33.000]  maybe you do thousands of people get bit by water moccasins every year
[46:33.000 --> 46:36.600]  hundreds and hundreds dying number one cause of death from snakes is water
[46:36.600 --> 46:40.280]  moccasin much worse than rattlesnake rattlesnakes won't stay away from you
[46:40.280 --> 46:46.120]  water moccasins are mean I had friends people I knew one guy in high school went
[46:46.120 --> 46:50.480]  to college jumped into the lake the water moccasins were in a ball mating
[46:50.480 --> 46:56.360]  ball killed him let him a hundreds of times died a cardiac arrest I mean do we
[46:56.360 --> 47:00.080]  not go to the lake and swim because there's one chance out of a million of
[47:00.080 --> 47:06.200]  snakes gonna bite us stop it stop I mean it is a just a culture of abject fear
[47:06.200 --> 47:11.600]  and it's so obvious even if you think 9-11 isn't an inside job there's no
[47:11.600 --> 47:16.960]  doubt it's being used to take our freedoms and that they're beta testing
[47:16.960 --> 47:21.680]  it away from Muslim extremists quote over to the general public in the
[47:21.680 --> 47:26.200]  Fedders anti-New World Order people why because you can say what you want about
[47:26.200 --> 47:30.080]  Muslims they're not going along with sterilization and GMO and the end of
[47:30.080 --> 47:33.720]  the family they've got to be knocked out so the globalist are gonna hire people
[47:33.720 --> 47:37.280]  and fund groups and allow extremists to attack so they can go in and kill
[47:37.280 --> 47:40.400]  millions of these people blow up their infrastructure to reduce their population
[47:40.400 --> 47:44.360]  send in occupying armies and then roll in the vaccines after that of course
[47:44.360 --> 47:50.680]  inoculations now beginning domestically who do they want people who are still
[47:50.680 --> 47:54.520]  Americans that love liberty freedom can skin a buck run a trot line know the
[47:54.520 --> 47:58.240]  fellow reserves private all the police manuals it's not about al-qaeda folks
[47:58.240 --> 48:03.520]  it's about you the very good old boys that cheered the police state think it
[48:03.520 --> 48:09.760]  and keep you safe now speaking of that here it is credible terror threat turns
[48:09.760 --> 48:15.000]  into fear-mongering farce the police stormed the aircraft that was landed it
[48:15.000 --> 48:18.880]  goes through all of this ABC news reports and told them anyone gets out of
[48:18.880 --> 48:23.640]  your seat you're dead they then took everybody off the plane and talked and
[48:23.640 --> 48:27.400]  interrogated and were told well this couple was giggling and laughing and
[48:27.400 --> 48:32.080]  went in the bathroom together and then came right back out no discernment you
[48:32.080 --> 48:38.640]  you see a couple giggling laughing going into the bathroom but they're running
[48:38.640 --> 48:43.080]  all these TV ads now where it shows a yuppie on a train leaving his bag and
[48:43.080 --> 48:48.320]  now I've seen it I've been at the airport and just put my bag here I've got
[48:48.320 --> 48:52.680]  some barbecue I'm eating I want some napkins and salt it's 15 feet away to
[48:52.680 --> 48:56.240]  the little kiosk I walk people like sorry your bag your bag I'm like yeah I
[48:56.240 --> 49:05.040]  know I'm getting I'm supposed to lug two big bags over just just people are

[49:12.240 --> 49:15.680]  show these TV ads now where it shows a guy at a mall leaves his bag and so a
[49:15.680 --> 49:20.080]  woman starts chasing him going stop he left his bag homeland security and then
[49:20.080 --> 49:23.640]  it cuts the TSA walk to the mall we're here to help ma'am we've posted these
[49:23.640 --> 49:31.320]  videos and there's now more than 10 of them in all the videos but one everyone
[49:31.320 --> 49:35.320]  is white who's a terrorist everyone's a minority that reports them even the
[49:35.320 --> 49:37.880]  Southern Poverty Law Center said yes it's whites through the terrorist and
[49:37.880 --> 49:43.080]  it's minorities that report them they're rebranding but then I'm racist for
[49:43.080 --> 49:48.600]  even recognizing I always point out stereotypes I mean this is the
[49:48.600 --> 49:51.440]  political correctness there was a Daily Mail article where they won't deliver
[49:51.440 --> 49:58.840]  now copies of the Bible or the Gospel of Matthew the British Postal Service
[49:58.840 --> 50:02.440]  saying it's a hate crime they're already arresting preachers in Canada that
[50:02.440 --> 50:05.520]  read from the Bible passages that are not like but now they're just saying
[50:05.520 --> 50:09.880]  Bibles aren't allowed period these politically correct people are not

[54:07.200 --> 54:12.080]  because there's a war on for your mind
[54:12.080 --> 54:38.040]  okay I'm ranting I'm out of control and I want to take your phone calls it's
[54:38.040 --> 54:45.080]  just when you watch people undermine control that's why the founding fathers
[54:45.080 --> 54:49.600]  talked about this so many other historians philosophers you have got to
[54:49.600 --> 54:53.840]  get control of fear in your life and after you get control of it finally and
[54:53.840 --> 54:59.600]  learn to just turn it loose it is so empowering you don't really start
[54:59.600 --> 55:04.200]  living until you get rid of your fear it doesn't mean you're dumb doesn't mean
[55:04.200 --> 55:08.920]  you go jump off a cliff or or or drive recklessly it's just you get control
[55:08.920 --> 55:14.920]  yourself and you think in a cold fashion and the statistics don't lie the
[55:14.920 --> 55:20.560]  statistics don't lie close to 400,000 people die here at automobile accident
[55:20.560 --> 55:25.120]  some years it's 300 something some years almost 400 we all still get in our
[55:25.120 --> 55:33.320]  cars we all still get on airplanes so how have we gotten to a point where they
[55:33.320 --> 55:42.960]  hype all of this terror they hype all of this fear to a crescendo and then I
[55:42.960 --> 55:47.400]  have stacks of the reports I know you saw it in your local area mattress blows
[55:47.400 --> 55:52.520]  out of back of a truck highway shut down and the the procedure for the police
[55:52.520 --> 55:55.400]  because they want their department to keep getting funded is put on a show
[55:55.400 --> 55:59.160]  there's actually been leaked memos over a decade ago about this and they'll send
[55:59.160 --> 56:03.840]  a robot up and blow up the mattress blow up the cardboard box and then it's on
[56:03.840 --> 56:07.360]  the news and people are like the suspicious package was blown up they
[56:07.360 --> 56:13.320]  never say wasn't a bomb was a bomb it's all meant to create the perception in
[56:13.320 --> 56:18.000]  the childlike minds of the public that there are bombs then they have drills
[56:18.000 --> 56:22.760]  unannounced in Chicago in Seattle some of these drills where they blow up
[56:22.760 --> 56:27.600]  buses they they burn areas of downtown they'll they'll lease 1015 houses and
[56:27.600 --> 56:30.760]  catch them or buy them and catch them on fire and then have the fire department
[56:30.760 --> 56:33.440]  there and there's smoke and bombs everybody's like terrorists are hitting
[56:33.440 --> 56:40.000]  an hour later I'm the mayor just a drill but again all of America is a giant
[56:40.000 --> 56:46.560]  reeducation camp that that's what this is this is Soviet reeducation they have
[56:46.560 --> 56:51.240]  drills coast-to-coast where they go in generally elementary students unannounced
[56:51.240 --> 56:55.400]  and actually point guns at them and scream at them and say we are anti-new
[56:55.400 --> 56:59.720]  world order people we hate you we're pro-second amendment we're pro-home
[56:59.720 --> 57:03.680]  school this is in the manuals look it up I've shown you the articles and the
[57:03.680 --> 57:07.520]  children cry and freak out and the parents are in such a trance to authority
[57:07.520 --> 57:10.800]  figures that when they get mad come to school they say it's alright we had to
[57:10.800 --> 57:16.040]  do it because of the militia it's a federal drill it's alright Mrs. Johnson
[57:16.040 --> 57:19.440]  it's alright this effect I remember reading the articles in the aftermath
[57:19.440 --> 57:24.360]  about it in a Michigan case many times on there how they handle the parents we
[57:24.360 --> 57:28.000]  have to do it for their safety it's because of the gun owners and they
[57:28.000 --> 57:31.600]  tell them it was a drill because the home schoolers might attack the school
[57:31.600 --> 57:35.000]  by the way if you're a new listener I'm not joking just like I said and culture
[57:35.000 --> 57:39.440]  said radiation is good for Japanese and I went and read the article to you I I
[57:39.440 --> 57:46.200]  mean I've probably played this 20 times over the years I played it gone and
[57:46.200 --> 57:50.720]  found the AP articles where where you know in in the federal grants they say
[57:50.720 --> 57:55.520]  we have to come here and say we are home schoolers against public education
[57:55.520 --> 57:59.800]  was one of the federal documents and all over the country little kids are
[57:59.800 --> 58:04.520]  sitting there and they're in their class and in run cops under federal grants to
[58:04.520 --> 58:08.160]  scream at them and yell at them and scare them and then tell them we're
[58:08.160 --> 58:12.360]  home schoolers and it actually works they tell them we're pro-second amendment
[58:12.360 --> 58:15.800]  group guns are bad and for the rest of their life the kids just traumatized and
[58:15.800 --> 58:19.240]  I hate those second amendment groups I had to be traumatized as a child for my
[58:19.240 --> 58:25.440]  safety and again it's so bold and so naked and people feel so powerless they
[58:25.440 --> 58:30.520]  decide to accept the cops doing it and go okay abuse my family you see it's a
[58:30.520 --> 58:36.520]  giant re-education camp America is a giant brainwashing camp with cops all
[58:36.520 --> 58:39.080]  scared to death

[01:00:51.400 --> 01:01:01.200]  this this last week first the system starts out this is very important in
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:06.520]  test cities all over the country in the last five years with a quote no refusal
[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:11.920]  weekend like oh you're not allowed to refuse this weekend there's no fourth
[01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:17.720]  amendment we're gonna take your blood at checkpoints it's like oh we don't have
[01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:21.520]  a bill of rights on this special day and then sure enough I told you this would
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:25.000]  happen because it follows their pattern it's all psychological warfare they've
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:30.000]  now announced all over the country well there's just no refusal 365 days a year
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:36.240]  there's no the fourth amendment we're taking your blood that's how they work
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:40.080]  so it's yeah on September 11th another dates we set up checkpoints all over the
[01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:44.080]  country and have the army out but you know what we're not gonna let Al Qaeda hit
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:49.200]  us and then it's all the time and then it's not Al Qaeda anymore it's Ron Paul
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:54.600]  supporters it's in the fetters see that's how this works and if you're a new
[01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:59.120]  listener and heard me talking about drills at public schools mainly
[01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:05.920]  elementary all over the country you're gravely mistaken I have shown you
[01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:09.880]  newscast where the children are crying and the police are aiming guns at them
[01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:14.280]  they have unannounced where guys come in in camo with guns and say they're gonna
[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:20.320]  kill people teachers have had heart attacks and collapse before one lady I
[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:24.720]  interviewed I got her lawyer on with me a few years ago where it happened in
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:29.080]  Minneapolis and they were out in the portable buildings it was what sixth
[01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:33.360]  grade and men came in and said where would the militia we're gonna kill you
[01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:37.600]  and they took them all out in the woods and they all believe they were gonna die
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:42.640]  and it was on the news that children were defecating urinating all over
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:47.240]  themselves the teacher collapsed and had mental problems ever since and another
[01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:51.080]  case where teacher had a heart attack they've had a bunch of cases where
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:57.440]  children are shot just type in child shot during police drill more often
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:04.960]  though cop killed in safety drill at school that's happened a bunch of places
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:10.800]  I mean this is beyond bizarre and they also have these drills this was on 60
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:16.120]  minutes of friday night on MSNBC where that was the other part of the show
[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:21.760]  they're like every place ever McDonald's every school every mall must have
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:26.080]  armed guards and locked down doors now you understand the cops like yes sir we
[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:30.920]  do the terrorist will hit you it was really weird cuz I guess they know a
[01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:34.240]  redneck and like send the mind control that or something but it's like do you
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:38.560]  understand because the cops man I'm telling the terrorist they're everywhere we
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:44.200]  gotta have security everywhere and God he's there to keep us safe they cut back
[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:48.080]  to this and this weird Colonel his eyes were like going around in circles he
[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:52.360]  looked nuts he's going I'm telling you right now it's a serious situation I'm
[01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:56.840]  gonna teach people how to survive the terrorist go ahead and the army colonel
[01:03:56.840 --> 01:04:01.120]  really works well with the military it shows like at this event 500 top
[01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:06.400]  officers come into here the colonel speak terrorism will affect everyone it
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:11.600]  will hit every target everyone will be at America it's about the start they
[01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:16.320]  cut to the military officers what do you think and the military officers this
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:18.520]  group didn't have the root you know the good old boy thing going with they were
[01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:22.800]  like well I understand it's a bit over the top it's what we need to keep us
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:28.940]  safe I mean it's just like cuckoo cuckoo cuckoo cuckoo I mean it is cuckoo for

[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:37.040]  you know a good way to describe my radio show my nightly television
[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:42.240]  transmission everything we do here at info wars and info wars.com is being off
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:49.000]  the grid off the reservation I don't mean off the grid power wise or water wise
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:53.000]  I mean off the grid not in this controlled paradigm not in this false
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:58.400]  phony baloney system all right we've got Tarpley joining us in about 30 minutes
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:04.400]  on the incredible developments in the world stock markets in the economy on
[01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:09.640]  the big developments in Libya here's the headline at prisonplanet.com former
[01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:13.440]  congressman I saw NATO troops behead Libyans
[01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:18.560]  Gaddafi forces are actually pushing back some of the operations the Al Qaeda
[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:23.440]  forces and again if you don't support Al Qaeda over there you're unpatriotic
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:29.200]  according to Obama also there's been a big reactor in fact I'm gonna go to your
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:33.160]  calls but I probably need to hit on this just briefly I mentioned it last hour
[01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:43.360]  but it's such a big deal a reactor that fires
[01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:55.120]  pellets of plutonium into uranium exploded and it's a mox fuel system where
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:10:00.560]  they take nuclear weapons and process it into fuel explosion hits French mock
[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:06.360]  nuke site threat of radioactive leak of plutonium processing plant an explosion
[01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:09.680]  of French nuclear facility that processes dangerous mox plutonium has
[01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:14.160]  killed one person injured four others provoking fear that radioactivity
[01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:18.280]  would be escaping into the atmosphere well we know they lied at Fukushima
[01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:22.320]  didn't they they always lie in fact if there was no radiation coming out they
[01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:26.120]  probably say there was I mean they just lie it's what they do although officials
[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:29.560]  have played down such concerns yeah that's the big telltale they're like
[01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:33.560]  well we don't think so right now but not releasing radiation numbers bing bing
[01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:35.800]  bing bing bing bing bing bing bing there you go it's it's leaking
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:39.720]  however the French government come precisity in hiding the severity of the
[01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:44.500]  86 Chernobyl disaster will do nothing to assure concerns and assuage concerns
[01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:48.280]  about authorities being honest with the public about the scale the problem there
[01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:52.700]  were no radioactive leaks after the blasts caused by fire near the furnace in
[01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:57.700]  in the SIN-TRACO radioactive waste storage site reports BBC.
[01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:02.960]  It produces mox fuel which recycles plutonium
[01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:05.260]  with nuclear weapons, but does not include
[01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:07.860]  reactors and reactions.
[01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:10.580]  French nuclear watchdog ASN has not explained
[01:11:10.580 --> 01:11:13.340]  the cause of the blast, but concerned that the furnace
[01:11:13.340 --> 01:11:17.900]  that used, that the explosion is used to melt waste
[01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:20.780]  with levels of radioactivity ranging from low to very high.
[01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:23.920]  As we highlighted during the Fukushima crisis,
[01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:26.640]  plutonium is the most deadly radioactive isotope known
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:29.520]  to man, and mox is two million times more deadly
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:31.800]  than normally enriched uranium.
[01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:36.800]  The half-life of plutonium 239 in mox is 24,000 years,
[01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:40.360]  and just a few milligrams of P-239 escaping
[01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:42.000]  into a plume of smoke will contaminate soil
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.200]  for tens of thousands of years.
[01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:46.960]  And they just go on to tell you everything's great.
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:48.400]  Trying to find that line, here it is.
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:50.920]  Part of the process involves firing superheated pellets
[01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:54.120]  of plutonium and uranium into an oven to reduce them
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:56.240]  in size to make them easier to store.
[01:11:56.240 --> 01:11:58.280]  Okay, let's go to your calls.
[01:11:58.280 --> 01:11:59.840]  I bet Ann Kolder says it's good for you,
[01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:02.560]  so does George Mombiot, so, hey, you know.
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:04.520]  They're establishment, they said so.
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:07.560]  The government says cameras everywhere in police
[01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:09.480]  and black uniforms is a sign of freedom,
[01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:11.320]  and now checkpoints all over the country.
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:12.640]  And I shouldn't be concerned even though I've been
[01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:14.920]  to urban warfare drills all over the country
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:16.640]  where the military trains to come to your house
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:19.560]  and take your gun and admit they're getting ready to do it.
[01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:21.200]  But everything's fine.
[01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:22.400]  Government cares about you.
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:25.000]  Come on, don't be extreme, folks.
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:26.960]  We just told you they'd implode the derivatives market
[01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:29.080]  and set up a world government.
[01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:31.080]  When Tarpley comes up, I was listening
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:33.280]  to Bloomberg Radio this morning driving in,
[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:35.440]  and they actually had three different guests
[01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:37.040]  from the time I was able to listen
[01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:38.640]  as I was getting some phone calls,
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:41.600]  say the same thing, we need a United States of America,
[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:43.080]  and that's gonna be cute,
[01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:44.800]  to fix all the world's economic problems.
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:46.640]  Look up the last three bailouts in Europe,
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:48.200]  we're gonna do that.
[01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:50.320]  And it was like, the government's bad,
[01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:52.320]  the people are bad, we all spent too much,
[01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:53.960]  and the banks are gonna fix it,
[01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:55.600]  you're gonna pay your taxes to them.
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:57.240]  How's that a United States of Europe
[01:12:57.240 --> 01:12:59.480]  where it's a total dictatorship of private banks,
[01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:01.040]  a quote, financial union,
[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:02.600]  and the banks that engineered this
[01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:05.040]  are the boss lecturing everyone
[01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:07.440]  because people don't know how this works.
[01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:10.760]  Even most people really think they're intellectual
[01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:12.880]  to even listen to something like Bloomberg.
[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:15.200]  Business people think they're smart
[01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:16.320]  because they listen to Bloomberg,
[01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:17.560]  or they read the Wall Street Journal.
[01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:20.120]  That's just propaganda for you.
[01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:22.400]  Oh, a lot of the truth's there,
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:24.640]  but it's got the spin on top.
[01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:25.840]  And so people listen to that,
[01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:27.440]  and then they go regurgitated
[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:29.620]  at boardroom meetings to sound smart.
[01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:33.240]  I can't tell you how many fake intellectuals
[01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:34.400]  I know in business people
[01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:37.280]  that will start trying to show off.
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:39.120]  And when somebody's talking about politics,
[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:41.120]  or numbers, or the economy,
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:41.960]  I'll listen to think,
[01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:43.640]  oh, wow, is this person actually informed?
[01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:44.480]  I want to talk to him.
[01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:45.720]  I want to get their view.
[01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:46.560]  And then I'll start listening,
[01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:48.240]  and I'm like, oh, they're just repeating something
[01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:49.920]  they saw on CNBC.
[01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:51.280]  And then I'll ask him another question,
[01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:52.920]  and then they prove they know nothing.
[01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:54.000]  And it's kind of real sad.
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.360]  Then we'll kind of get embarrassed.
[01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:57.360]  Oh, look, look, look.
[01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:00.920]  You're not going to learn anything
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:03.760]  except that they're throwing at your face sometimes.
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:05.360]  They'll admit, yeah, banks launder the money,
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:06.920]  what you going to do about it?
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:10.000]  Yeah, foreign banks took over, yeah.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.600]  I mean, some of that's going on.
[01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:14.040]  You're going to learn some things.
[01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:16.680]  But where you really learn things is reading history
[01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:18.160]  and a wide spectrum of it,
[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:19.760]  because you're not getting total truth
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:21.400]  in any history book.
[01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:22.760]  It's impossible.
[01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:23.920]  We're looking at the past.
[01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:25.080]  It's going to be distorted.
[01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:27.360]  But you study human nature enough.
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:28.800]  You study history enough.
[01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:31.240]  And then you study the globalist
[01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:33.840]  and their philosophy and what they're into today,
[01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:36.600]  and you know basically everything.
[01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:39.320]  Just like in criminology, good cops,
[01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:41.200]  they don't really, really try to teach that anymore.
[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:43.120]  But old fashioned crime fighting
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:45.280]  is all about psychological types
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:47.720]  and people's modus operandi.
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:50.080]  And then once you understand different types of people,
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:52.400]  once you're able to study the crimes they've committed,
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:54.000]  you start to get inside their mind.
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.040]  And that's all I've done.
[01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:56.840]  And it's not that hard to do.
[01:14:56.840 --> 01:14:58.880]  And I know exactly what they're doing.
[01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:02.560]  I know their general game plan and it is not fun.
[01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:04.040]  And these people are the worst of the worst.
[01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:08.640]  See, the very worst in society get into power, the very top,
[01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:09.760]  because they're willing to kill,
[01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:11.480]  steal, steal, do whatever to get it.
[01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:14.520]  They desire it because they want to exercise the power.
[01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:16.840]  Good people become successful,
[01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:19.880]  but then become fat, dumb and happy and don't want more power.
[01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:21.440]  You just want enough power to be comfortable,
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:24.440]  to be respected and to raise a good family.
[01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:27.120]  Good people have to serve
[01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:29.120]  and have to get into positions of power.
[01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:30.640]  We have to become wealthy.
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:32.360]  We have to become powerful.
[01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:35.360]  That's the only way we're going to defeat the globalist, okay?
[01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:36.560]  All right, let's go to your calls.
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:37.920]  Thank you for holding.
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:41.360]  Let's talk to Janice in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:42.760]  Hi, Alex.
[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:46.960]  I have two important news items I wanted to tell you about.
[01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:50.760]  On Wednesday, on CNN, last Wednesday,
[01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:52.760]  Rear Admiral Anne Shushot,
[01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:56.160]  the head of respiratory ailments,
[01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:59.160]  contagious respiratory ailments in the CDC,
[01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:01.160]  was on there with this other guy.
[01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:03.760]  Yeah, notice how they have admirals and generals
[01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:05.560]  over all the federal departments now.
[01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:06.560]  I mean, what is this?
[01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:07.560]  Venezuela?
[01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:08.560]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:11.560]  Well, they are rolling out this new technology.
[01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:13.560]  There they are, like in front of the world,
[01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:15.960]  rolling out this thing that looks like a printer
[01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:19.560]  with very little information, like even a fingerprint,
[01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:23.160]  they can sequence your entire human genome.
[01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:25.160]  And they were saying how wonderful it was
[01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:27.560]  because they can look at the genome
[01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:29.560]  and find out if you have the illness.
[01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:32.960]  Well, you know, the human genome says everything.
[01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:36.560]  So I see this is like the end of humanity.
[01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:37.560]  No, it is.
[01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:38.560]  It is the end.
[01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:39.560]  It is the end.
[01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:41.560]  But the cops aren't scared of that.
[01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:44.560]  They're scared of non-existent real terror
[01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:46.560]  and the fake stuff is very rare.
[01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:49.560]  And I mean, that's why they, I mean,
[01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:51.560]  not all cops are dumb, a lot of them are smart,
[01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:54.560]  but that's why they try to hire 100 IQ and below.
[01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:57.560]  And now it's coming out, they're trying to figure out
[01:16:57.560 --> 01:17:00.560]  if they can hire even 80 IQ people who can barely operate
[01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:03.560]  because they need people that are dumb
[01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:06.560]  because only dumb people would destroy themselves like this.
[01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:08.560]  And it's on.
[01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:11.560]  And absolutely, they're rolling out all these technologies.
[01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:15.560]  And I remember four years ago at an anti-war demonstration,
[01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:20.560]  people reported that there were fake dragonflies flying around.
[01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:22.560]  And I went and looked it up when people reported it
[01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:24.560]  and the Washington Post made fun of them
[01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:26.560]  and found a bunch of prototype companies
[01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:30.560]  that Homeland Security had indeed bought them some of these.
[01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:32.560]  And I called the people out and I sent them an email.
[01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:33.560]  I said, is this what you saw?
[01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:34.560]  And they said, yeah.
[01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:36.560]  And I went on there and said, you know, here it is.
[01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:37.560]  And the media made fun of me.
[01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:39.560]  Joan says there's fake, fake insects flying around.
[01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:41.560]  And then a couple years later, they came on and said,
[01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:44.560]  yeah, we're watching people all over with fake insects.
[01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:47.560]  In fact, they've got real insects now with chips on them
[01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:49.560]  that they can send into your house with a camera.
[01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:52.560]  They've had robo rats for 20 years with a brain chip.
[01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:54.560]  So yeah, we're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:56.560]  That's why they're so arrogant.
[01:17:56.560 --> 01:17:58.560]  And they're just getting their police state grid in place
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:00.560]  and then they're going to start wiping everybody out,
[01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:01.560]  including the cops.
[01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:03.560]  And the most the cops are going to go to their graves
[01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:05.560]  with the ship serving the system.
[01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:06.560]  They're dog-like.
[01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:09.560]  They will follow their masters straight to hell.
[01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:11.560]  What do you think of that?
[01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:14.560]  Well, there's one more thing I wanted to add.
[01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:18.560]  A while back I saw Dennis Miller on The O'Reilly Show
[01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:22.560]  and O'Reilly and Dennis Miller were both bashing Nancy Grace.
[01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:25.560]  They played a clip and she was concerned about
[01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:29.560]  the Fukushima fallout going on to the United States
[01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:31.560]  and she had maps and whatever.
[01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:33.560]  And they just proceeded to just thrash her,
[01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:36.560]  make fun of her, discredit her, say she was a hack.
[01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:39.560]  I mean, so there's, you know, you can, like,
[01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:41.560]  probably look that up, but they made fun of her.
[01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:42.560]  Janice, great call.
[01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:45.560]  I did see that on YouTube, that compilation of those.
[01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:47.560]  There was an article I meant to get to yesterday
[01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:48.560]  and I didn't.
[01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:49.560]  I'm going to remind me, crib, I don't cover it
[01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:51.560]  in the third hour to do it.
[01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:54.560]  It was a headline like Ron Paul is a nut
[01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:55.560]  in the Washington Post.
[01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:57.560]  It was similar to that.
[01:18:57.560 --> 01:18:59.560]  And the article said he's completely insane.
[01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:02.560]  There was a backlash against the media ignoring him,
[01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:04.560]  but now it's been proven they were right.
[01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:09.560]  This man made an insane statement about a dime's worth of silver,
[01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:12.560]  you know, could buy you a gallon of gas.
[01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:15.560]  Well, almost more than a gallon, Ron Paul,
[01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:19.560]  and they said that he is insane.
[01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:21.560]  Now that's like saying this guy says finding an oasis
[01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:23.560]  in the desert and drinking water is good.
[01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:25.560]  This guy's nuts.
[01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:27.560]  He says you can drink water out of Lake Superior.
[01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:30.560]  Ron Paul said that an ice cold Coca-Cola was delicious
[01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:32.560]  on a hot sunny afternoon.
[01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:33.560]  This guy's insane.
[01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:37.560]  Of course, it's totally public that a pure silver dime
[01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:42.560]  pre-60s, you know, is worth, what is it,
[01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:46.560]  $3 or $4 now?
[01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:48.560]  I mean, I mean, that's a fact.
[01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:51.560]  And that Ron Paul said was totally true about inflation.
[01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:53.560]  But see, their answer is to think their readers are dumb
[01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:58.560]  and go, look, the dumb man said they devalued the money.
[01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:00.560]  Isn't it funny?
[01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:01.560]  What happened, man?
[01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:05.560]  You used to be energetic, happy, and wow, did the ladies love you.
[01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:09.560]  Now you fall asleep on the couch, irritable, and out of shape.
[01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:10.560]  Don't be that guy.

[01:20:54.560 --> 01:21:00.560]  That's 1-800-497-8345.
[01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:05.560]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:08.560]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming,
[01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:12.560]  and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:14.560]  Number one, study the past.
[01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:16.560]  History really does repeat itself.
[01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:21.560]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:24.560]  Number three, take decisive action.
[01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:28.560]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:31.560]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book,
[01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:33.560]  Rising Prices, Empty Shelves,
[01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:37.560]  warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:41.560]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:45.560]  This book is only available at RisingPricesEmptyShelves.com.
[01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:48.560]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival,
[01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:50.560]  how to cut your grocery bills in half.

[01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:30.560]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:33.560]  Have you ever wondered why bank stockbrokers investment advisors
[01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:35.560]  won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:37.560]  They've been available since 1986,
[01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:41.560]  yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:44.560]  Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:49.560]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:57.560]  All right, let's go back to your phone calls.
[01:23:57.560 --> 01:23:59.560]  Let's talk to Michael in Texas.
[01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:01.560]  You're on the air, sir. Welcome.
[01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:03.560]  Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:07.560]  I'd like to address a little bit of this to the tour today.
[01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:08.560]  Thank you.
[01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:09.560]  Thank you.
[01:24:09.560 --> 01:24:10.560]  Thank you.
[01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:11.560]  Thank you.
[01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:12.560]  Thank you.
[01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:13.560]  Thank you.
[01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:14.560]  Thank you.
[01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:18.560]  I'd like to address a little bit of this to this tour of this false bologna system.
[01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:24.560]  And if the American citizens understood the differences between legal
[01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:30.560]  and lawful, and the reasons why, lawful law abides by an oppose the Constitution.
[01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:37.560]  Legal law is the system designed by the British and established with the act of 1871
[01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:39.560]  and it was.
[01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:41.560]  By the way, what you're saying is absolutely true.
[01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:48.520]  It's admiralty administrative law that is just regulations issued basically by the crown.
[01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:53.260]  It's the bureaucracy and that's how the British, once the British had the Parliament Act and
[01:24:53.260 --> 01:24:56.240]  other events started reducing the power of the monarchy.
[01:24:56.240 --> 01:25:02.860]  They figured out how to create parallel systems that sounded similar just to fool people to
[01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:03.860]  give up their rights.
[01:25:03.860 --> 01:25:08.760]  You have a parallel system of lawful, which goes back to the ancient common law and then
[01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:16.880]  the Bill of Rights Constitution versus administrative law or the law of merchants that is completely
[01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:17.880]  arbitrary.
[01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:21.640]  That's why they say it's our policy to stick our hands down your pants.
[01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:24.760]  It's our policy to take blood from you without a warrant.
[01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:25.840]  It's our policy.
[01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:27.400]  It's policy.
[01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:28.840]  It's their policy.
[01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:32.920]  And policy is we got a bunch of dumb mercenaries that will do whatever we're told and we got
[01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:34.600]  kangaroo courts that will go along with it.
[01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:35.600]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:40.880]  Yeah, and their system was brought in to skirt the Constitution and go around and they made
[01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:45.840]  all attorneys and lawyers believe that they must qualify to do business in their systems
[01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:51.880]  courts by passing the bar exam, which really is the bar stands for British accredited registry,
[01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:57.400]  which means they're qualified and now they're workers of the British Empire.
[01:25:57.400 --> 01:26:04.640]  If you ask most lawyers, they say what the bar stands for, they wouldn't have any idea
[01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:06.960]  other than they'd probably say barrister.
[01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:11.200]  And another thing I'd like to mention is how they bring in a lot of their unlawful laws
[01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:13.960]  is through the passive law and legal terms.
[01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:21.400]  It means even if a law is unlawful, if you do not object and never protest in any way,
[01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:24.280]  then by silent occupations, you're saying you agree with it.
[01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:27.960]  Well, is that force du jour or force majeure, the most powerful force?
[01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:30.000]  It's possessions nine-tenths of the law.
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:31.360]  They are just rolling over you.
[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:37.320]  And isn't that a central tentative law that rights must be demanded and stood upon?
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:39.680]  People just think you go in and then they're there.
[01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:42.280]  No, you have to absolutely demand them.
[01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:47.000]  The globalist only listen to people that actually speak to them straight up and understand them.
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.120]  They don't even begin to respect you.
[01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:54.840]  And so much of the public, yuppies, go along, get alongers, media whores, a lot of them
[01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:59.360]  know the truth, but they think by sucking up, you know, they're part of the system.
[01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:00.360]  No.
[01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:02.040]  The system destroys its own.
[01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:06.400]  The only way we're going to survive, and the only way somebody from nowhere could ever
[01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:12.160]  have any power in this world, is to recognize your rightful duties and responsibilities
[01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:14.560]  as a free, sentient being.
[01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:17.680]  If you act like a slave, you will be a slave.
[01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:18.680]  You there?
[01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:19.680]  Yes, sir.
[01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:20.680]  Yeah.
[01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:21.680]  I got one more thing.
[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:25.800]  There's a fellow Texan named Charles Irwin who's written a wonderful book that covers
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:26.800]  all these issues.
[01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:28.720]  It's called American Freedom.
[01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:32.280]  And I think he'd be a wonderful guest for you to have on the program and discuss these
[01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:33.280]  issues.
[01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:35.480]  He's just a magnificent book.
[01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:40.080]  Yeah, there's another gentleman we've had on from the Dallas area.
[01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:43.720]  It was demonized in that 60 minutes piece that I intended to get back on.
[01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:46.000]  He was a great, great Skype interview.
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:47.480]  Alfred Addis.
[01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:48.960]  Alfred Addis.
[01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:49.960]  Alfred Addis.
[01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:51.200]  I want to get him back on, Jaren.
[01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:52.200]  Pronto.
[01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:53.800]  We'll get him on the TV show too.
[01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:54.800]  Thank you so much.
[01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:55.800]  I appreciate your call.
[01:27:55.800 --> 01:28:00.480]  We're live tonight with a lot of key subjects, a lot of key news items.
[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:04.800]  On the radio, of course, back tomorrow at 11 a.m., we still got half the show ahead
[01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:05.800]  of us.
[01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:10.720]  I just want to point out that we'll be on the TV tonight, 7 o'clock central at mfoldwarchnews.com.
[01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:11.720]  You're not a subscriber.
[01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:12.720]  Become one today.
[01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:13.720]  Tim in Michigan.
[01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:14.720]  Thanks for holding.
[01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:15.720]  Go ahead.
[01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:16.720]  Hey, Alex.
[01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:17.720]  Hey.
[01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:19.800]  Hey, how are you doing?
[01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:20.800]  On the radio, brother.
[01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:21.800]  What's up?
[01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:22.800]  Hey.
[01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:31.800]  Yeah, I never had anybody ever refer to me as, said, shut up, Tim.
[01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:32.800]  You're our friend.
[01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:33.800]  Talk.
[01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:37.800]  My girlfriend was laughing when I told her what you said.
[01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:44.800]  Anyway, this is, I have a friend that called me yesterday who went to New York.
[01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:45.800]  Okay?
[01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:51.800]  So he was down there, let's say I had a man on the inside.
[01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:52.800]  Okay?
[01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:58.800]  And let me tell you what he, what he, how, what his observation was.
[01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:01.800]  First of all, I asked him, I said, how are the police?
[01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:07.800]  Were they being, were they, were they trying, you know, to harass you?
[01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:14.800]  And he was taking pictures, but he stayed back far enough so that they wouldn't bother.
[01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:15.800]  Okay.
[01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:16.800]  What happened?
[01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:17.800]  Okay.
[01:29:17.800 --> 01:29:23.800]  He was able to take a few pictures of, there's a banner that was hung across.
[01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:26.800]  One of the, did you guys send that yet?
[01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:31.800]  I'm going to send you, I'm going to send you a few pictures, right, right, right from.
[01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:32.800]  Great.
[01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:33.800]  Great.
[01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:34.800]  What did the banner say?
[01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:38.800]  I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to email him to you.
[01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:46.800]  But anyway, the banner said that the Bush regime was responsible for 9-11.
[01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:47.800]  Hold on.
[01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:48.800]  I want to hear about this.
[01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:49.800]  Stay with us.
[01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:53.800]  We're on the march, the empires on the run.
[01:29:53.800 --> 01:30:22.800]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:23.800 --> 01:30:49.800]  We're on the march.
[01:30:49.800 --> 01:31:15.800]  We're on the march, the empires on the run.
[01:31:15.800 --> 01:31:41.800]  We're on the march, the empires on the run.
[01:31:41.800 --> 01:32:08.800]  We're on the march, the empires on the run.
[01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:34.800]  We're on the march, the empires on the run.
[01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:59.800]  We're on the march.
[01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:33.800]  We're on the march, the empires on the run.
[01:33:33.800 --> 01:34:02.800]  We're on the march, the empires on the run.
[01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:29.800]  We're on the march, the empires on the run.
[01:34:29.800 --> 01:34:35.800]  I heard that there were a lot of activists there in New York.
[01:34:35.800 --> 01:34:37.800]  You say you were talking to one of your friends.
[01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:40.800]  You said you're going to be sending that email soon to our office.
[01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:44.800]  So send it right now and we'll show it as soon as we get it.
[01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:49.800]  But you're saying somebody did a banner hang where saying that Bush was responsible for 9-11.
[01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:53.800]  Well, it looks like, let me tell you what it looks like to me.
[01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:55.800]  Hang on a minute.
[01:34:55.800 --> 01:34:57.800]  No, I understand your friend gave you this photo.
[01:34:57.800 --> 01:34:58.800]  Just what is it?
[01:34:58.800 --> 01:34:59.800]  Right.
[01:34:59.800 --> 01:35:08.800]  It says it looks like some kind of an old church or maybe it's got a steeple.
[01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:11.800]  So I'm going to say it's a really, really old church.
[01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:17.800]  I understand it's a church, but in New York, close to ground zero, correct?
[01:35:17.800 --> 01:35:18.800]  Yes.
[01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:20.800]  What did it say?
[01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:22.800]  What did it say?
[01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:30.800]  The Bush regime engineered 9-11 and the only thing is, is there's some girl that's standing
[01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:32.800]  in front of right in front of 9-11.
[01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:36.800]  But you could see the one and you could just barely see the beginning of the nine.
[01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:37.800]  But it's obvious.
[01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:38.800]  Yeah.
[01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:43.800]  What did your friend say the response was by people?
[01:35:43.800 --> 01:35:45.800]  Check it out.
[01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:53.800]  He said there were thousands of people that stayed outside the perimeter that were wearing
[01:35:53.800 --> 01:35:56.800]  9-11 was an inside job shirt.
[01:35:56.800 --> 01:36:06.800]  And while they were trying to give their little press a snow job.
[01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:11.800]  They're vampiric sucking operation off of the dead firefighters and police.
[01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:17.800]  The survivors of course are barred, but because they know the truth.
[01:36:17.800 --> 01:36:18.800]  But go ahead.
[01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:24.800]  Well, they were going so loud, Alex, that 9-11 was an inside job that you couldn't even
[01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:25.800]  hear.
[01:36:25.800 --> 01:36:29.800]  We know when they get some fire chief up here, probably wasn't even at 9-11.
[01:36:29.800 --> 01:36:30.800]  All right.
[01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:31.800]  Well, that's interesting.
[01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:35.800]  We're going to get Luke Radowski on to give us his take on what he saw and did there.
[01:36:35.800 --> 01:36:36.800]  We appreciate your call, Tim.
[01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:38.800]  Your phone is over driving.
[01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:41.800]  Every time you call in, though, it's just like peeking out.
[01:36:41.800 --> 01:36:43.800]  You might turn the volume down on that.
[01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:44.800]  But thank you.
[01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:45.800]  We're interested to look into that.
[01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:51.800]  Now, joining us is someone who was there at Ground Zero for 9-11, somebody who was there
[01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:58.800]  at multiple speaking events and is joining us via cell phone from the park there in New
[01:36:58.800 --> 01:36:59.800]  York City.
[01:36:59.800 --> 01:37:01.800]  Webster Griffin Tarpoli, doctor of history.
[01:37:01.800 --> 01:37:02.800]  He's also an economist.
[01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:07.800]  He's been to Libya just the last few months and predicted what was already going on in
[01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:09.800]  the United States, the massacre of blacks.
[01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:11.800]  That's now been confirmed.
[01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:16.800]  Former Congressman who was thought dead but was in hiding in Libya because of the Al Qaeda
[01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:21.800]  forces trying to kill him says he saw NATO troops beheading Libyans and killing blacks
[01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:22.800]  systematically.
[01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:24.800]  Even Reuters has confirmed that's happening.
[01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:28.800]  30,000 slaughtered so far, a humanitarian war crime.
[01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:30.800]  We'll talk about that with Tarpoli as well.
[01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:32.800]  Webster Griffin Tarpoli, thank you for joining us.
[01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:37.800]  First off, tell us what you witnessed this year 10 years after the false flag event.
[01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:39.800]  Well, Alex, I have to make it clear.
[01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:43.800]  You couldn't get near these commemorations.
[01:37:43.800 --> 01:37:47.800]  You had to be a family member or something.
[01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:56.800]  What I attended was the one big event in the city which was a rally and lectures against
[01:37:56.800 --> 01:37:57.800]  the official story.
[01:37:57.800 --> 01:38:02.800]  In other words, the New York that can say no, I was glad to be there.
[01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:04.800]  This was at Independent Network News.
[01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:07.800]  It's an operation on radio and sometimes on television.
[01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:10.800]  It's run by Lenny Charles and Tom Tiley.
[01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:12.800]  This is here on Walker Street.
[01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:15.800]  It's basically Walker Street near 6th Avenue.
[01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:17.800]  It's Tribeca more or less.
[01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:20.800]  It's actually quite close to ground zero.
[01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:26.800]  We had 300 New Yorkers saying no to the official bologna and not just unanswered questions,
[01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:30.800]  but essentially, my hop made it happen on purpose.
[01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:32.800]  The Rogue Network did it.
[01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:39.800]  It's a privately controlled rogue network of treasonous putschists, co-artists in the U.S.
[01:38:39.800 --> 01:38:41.800]  government, and they did it.
[01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:43.800]  They did it through the 46th drill.
[01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:50.800]  This was the debut of my fifth edition of 9-Eleven Centenary Made in USA.
[01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:55.800]  I urge people to get it because I've gone from 25 drills a couple of years ago to
[01:38:55.800 --> 01:38:57.800]  46 drills.
[01:38:57.800 --> 01:39:04.800]  46 drills in the two years before, on the day of, and a couple of their basically in advanced preparation.
[01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:06.800]  So that's how it was done.
[01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:08.800]  We had Wayne Madden.
[01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:12.800]  We had, let's see, we had Ray McGovern.
[01:39:12.800 --> 01:39:15.800]  We had Gary Noll, a bunch of other speakers.
[01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:17.800]  Very good atmosphere.
[01:39:17.800 --> 01:39:20.800]  The 9-Eleven Movement, of course, is not what it was.
[01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:23.800]  Obama has sucked the atmosphere, the oxygen out of the room.
[01:39:23.800 --> 01:39:27.800]  And, of course, a lot of the websites have been taken over by people who really act more
[01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:30.800]  like provocateurs than truth-seekers.
[01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:33.800]  There's still a hard core of good, strong support.
[01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:35.800]  A lot of them are your fans, Alex.
[01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:40.800]  A lot of them ask about you and, you know, they say they've heard me on your program.
[01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:46.800]  But Webster, I rarely disagree with you on points of fact.
[01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:52.800]  I mean, I may disagree on political or socioeconomic solutions or policy,
[01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:54.800]  but I've got to disagree with you.
[01:39:54.800 --> 01:40:02.800]  What's happened with 9-Eleven Truth is it doesn't have the liberal core to it
[01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:06.800]  that was involved in it because they were just anti-bush and anti-war.
[01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:14.800]  That group has been foundation co-opted and is broken up.
[01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:18.800]  The general understanding that 9-Eleven is an inside job,
[01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:25.800]  the general awakening to false flag terror as a tool of statecraft throughout history,
[01:40:25.800 --> 01:40:31.800]  the acceptance of the fact that government stage events in culture and society
[01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:37.800]  across the board has never been more powerful.
[01:40:37.800 --> 01:40:40.800]  Yes, as an opinion, I think you're probably right.
[01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:45.800]  But in what counts in this world, which is organized political power,
[01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:49.800]  we really need to turn out thousands of people and get them to do something reasonable.
[01:40:49.800 --> 01:40:53.800]  I'm afraid for the moment this is not where it was in 2006.
[01:40:53.800 --> 01:40:57.800]  Let's take your conference in Los Angeles in 2006.
[01:40:57.800 --> 01:41:01.800]  That was a great watershed when that conference that you organized
[01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:05.800]  with the 1,200 people in Los Angeles, when that got on C-span,
[01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:10.800]  that broke the control of the reactionary Republicans over the House and the Senate.
[01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:15.800]  And it essentially headed off the Iran War and the Syria War that the rogue network
[01:41:15.800 --> 01:41:19.800]  would have bootlegged in through Cheney in particular.
[01:41:19.800 --> 01:41:23.800]  Cheney has got a new biography, autobiography out, like In My Time,
[01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:30.800]  where he confesses that he was pushing for war with Syria in June of 2007.
[01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:32.800]  He tried to get Bush to approve it.
[01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:34.800]  He couldn't get support in the cabinet.
[01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:38.800]  He's very bitter that Condi Rice wouldn't go with him at that point.
[01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:42.800]  But of course then, after Cheney had failed to convince Bush,
[01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:46.800]  the rogue network went to work above and behind both of them.
[01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:51.800]  And then we had that rogue B-52 of August, September 2007.
[01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:55.800]  That was the extra legal attempt by the rogue network.
[01:41:55.800 --> 01:42:00.800]  They basically hijacked the B-52 and took it from North Dakota to Louisiana
[01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:02.800]  that was on its way to the Middle East.
[01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:06.800]  And this is all documented now and it's coming out more and more.
[01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:11.800]  The great thing about 9-11 Truths was to have it headed off those things.
[01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:15.800]  Now, obviously there's a lot to be done, but right now we're on the verge
[01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:17.800]  of a European banking panic.
[01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:21.800]  Oh my God, a jackhammer has opened up here behind me.
[01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:23.800]  This is New York.
[01:42:23.800 --> 01:42:24.800]  I don't know if that's...
[01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:25.800]  No, no, it's okay.
[01:42:25.800 --> 01:42:26.800]  It's okay.
[01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:29.800]  I want to get into what's happening in Europe because they're announcing,
[01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:33.800]  on Bloomberg and everywhere else, the bankers are going to save you
[01:42:33.800 --> 01:42:36.800]  and they openly said on Bloomberg this morning, it's a new talking point,
[01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:40.800]  it's the public's fault and it's the government's fault
[01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:44.800]  and the bankers that created the derivatives and got our government traders
[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:50.800]  assigned on to their debt, they're going to fix it with VAT and carbon taxes
[01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:54.800]  paid to them with this new United States of Europe,
[01:42:54.800 --> 01:42:56.800]  which isn't a United States with liberty and freedom.
[01:42:56.800 --> 01:43:01.800]  It's a banking dictatorship, a finance oligarch tyranny,
[01:43:01.800 --> 01:43:04.800]  a corporate receivership system, as you know,
[01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:08.800]  that you predicted an Obama deception in the fall of the Republic.
[01:43:08.800 --> 01:43:11.800]  So what do you say to this new talking point?
[01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:13.800]  This is Europe of the banks and cartels.
[01:43:13.800 --> 01:43:14.800]  Here's the point.
[01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:19.800]  You've got now about a dozen banks in Europe that are candidates to be
[01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:22.800]  the next Lehman Brothers and we can just go down the list,
[01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:27.800]  but it's essentially the top two or three money-fetter banks in each country.
[01:43:27.800 --> 01:43:31.800]  These are zombie banks. They don't have any social function.
[01:43:31.800 --> 01:43:34.800]  They don't provide capital for productive investment.
[01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:36.800]  They just stuck in public resources.
[01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:40.800]  I have not been able to keep up with the banking panic here over the weekend
[01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:42.800]  because of the density of 9-11 stuff.
[01:43:42.800 --> 01:43:46.800]  But what I heard this morning is the bankers are going to try to get China
[01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:49.800]  to backstop their derivatives bubble.
[01:43:49.800 --> 01:43:53.800]  If the Chinese do that, that will be national suicide for China
[01:43:53.800 --> 01:43:57.800]  and that will essentially seal their doom and I would urge China not to do that.
[01:43:57.800 --> 01:44:03.800]  Don't get stuck in to propping up the debt of these bankrupt finance
[01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:08.800]  oligarchs and derivatives mongers.
[01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:12.800]  Now, Webster, going back to false flag terror for a moment,
[01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:14.800]  I want to get back into the economy and then I want to get...
[01:44:14.800 --> 01:44:18.800]  By the US. By the US and the British.
[01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:21.800]  Well, by the corporate oligarchy,
[01:44:21.800 --> 01:44:23.800]  getting back to false flag terror,
[01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:29.800]  I'm seeing major acclimation, major ground preparation psychologically,
[01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:34.800]  major rollout, preparatory phase for big false flags.
[01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:39.800]  They are really hyping it and having army checkpoints with regular police
[01:44:39.800 --> 01:44:42.800]  all over the country as a way to condition the public.
[01:44:42.800 --> 01:44:46.800]  And then, of course, they could stage terror, blame it on anti-federal reserve groups.
[01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:50.800]  What is your view on the incredible drum beating that I'm seeing?
[01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:53.800]  Well, I posted on Friday night, I think.
[01:44:53.800 --> 01:44:57.800]  I put up on my website topsy.net an alert.
[01:44:57.800 --> 01:45:00.800]  Basically, I would say it's time for something like an orange alert.
[01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:05.800]  This is because the European banking panic, the US banking panic,
[01:45:05.800 --> 01:45:09.800]  it would be very convenient, for example, to declare martial law
[01:45:09.800 --> 01:45:11.800]  and under the cover of martial law,
[01:45:11.800 --> 01:45:16.800]  essentially use executive orders to order another bailout.
[01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:20.800]  It would be very hard to get a bailout through Congress for the zombie banks.
[01:45:20.800 --> 01:45:23.800]  But if the zombie banks blow, they're going to want a second bailout.
[01:45:23.800 --> 01:45:27.800]  And I think the only way to do that is under the cover of martial law.
[01:45:27.800 --> 01:45:29.800]  There will be demonstrations now.
[01:45:29.800 --> 01:45:32.800]  People will be out there fighting against genocidal austerity
[01:45:32.800 --> 01:45:35.800]  imposed by reactionary politicians and Wall Street.
[01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:37.800]  Well, that's another question.
[01:45:37.800 --> 01:45:40.800]  They've now announced what we were told three years ago was going to happen.
[01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:43.800]  They're getting ready to take at least half the pension funds
[01:45:43.800 --> 01:45:47.800]  on top of dollar devaluation that also steals the value
[01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:52.800]  of the 20 year and more vets who were under law guaranteed their pension.
[01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:56.800]  They're talking openly saying how great it is to take half their pension fund.
[01:45:56.800 --> 01:46:01.800]  And Webster, they may not have to stage anything when they do that.
[01:46:01.800 --> 01:46:05.800]  There's a bunch of old vets. They're going to get very, very angry.
[01:46:05.800 --> 01:46:09.800]  The other thing of question is the international picture.
[01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:14.800]  Right now, the Anglo-Americans are very upset because their destabilization of Syria
[01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:17.800]  is not working, has not worked.
[01:46:17.800 --> 01:46:21.800]  The Syrian army, I guess by and large, has crushed the death squads
[01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:24.800]  and terrorist commandos of the Muslim Brotherhood
[01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:28.800]  and whatever else NATO and the CIA were able to funnel into Syria.
[01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:33.800]  And it looks to me like the situation in Syria will now quiet down gradually,
[01:46:33.800 --> 01:46:38.800]  although the constant attempts by Anglo-American media to create the fiction,
[01:46:38.800 --> 01:46:40.800]  the illusion of some kind of a...
[01:46:40.800 --> 01:46:44.800]  But what's the end game? Why put Muslim Brotherhood al-Qaeda in Egypt
[01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:47.800]  and then allow them to torch the Israeli embassy?
[01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:49.800]  We know the West is orchestrating that.
[01:46:49.800 --> 01:46:53.800]  Why let al-Qaeda attack Syria? Why give Libya to al-Qaeda
[01:46:53.800 --> 01:46:57.800]  and admittedly now missile systems? What comes after that?
[01:46:57.800 --> 01:46:59.800]  Why is al-Qaeda so loving?
[01:46:59.800 --> 01:47:03.800]  It's the policy is to destroy the modern state.
[01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:07.800]  These are neo feudalist Anglo-American financiers.
[01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:10.800]  They want to smash the modern nation state,
[01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:14.800]  because that's where resistance from them can emerge and has emerged.
[01:47:14.800 --> 01:47:17.800]  They would like to smash Libya. They're in the process of that.
[01:47:17.800 --> 01:47:20.800]  They wanted to smash Syria. The same thing would go for Egypt.
[01:47:20.800 --> 01:47:24.800]  They would basically...they would like to jetters in most of Egypt
[01:47:24.800 --> 01:47:28.800]  and simply seize the Aswan High Dam and the Lake National Complex
[01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:31.800]  and the Suez Canal, and the rest of it can go to hell
[01:47:31.800 --> 01:47:33.800]  from the Anglo-American point of view.
[01:47:33.800 --> 01:47:36.800]  Israel is also in the big pressure.
[01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:39.800]  Here on the other side of town, we have the United Nations General Assembly
[01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:43.800]  is basically coming together now in the course of this next week.
[01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:47.800]  There will be an attempt by the Palestinians to assert their statehood.
[01:47:47.800 --> 01:47:50.800]  In other words, the idea that they deserve a nation state,
[01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:53.800]  which I think is absolutely correct.
[01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:56.800]  They will get broad support from the world community.
[01:47:56.800 --> 01:47:59.800]  They may well get the two thirds in the General Assembly that they need.
[01:47:59.800 --> 01:48:04.800]  If it gets to the Security Council, the United States will be forced to cast
[01:48:04.800 --> 01:48:08.800]  a very embarrassing, tormented, isolated veto.
[01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:13.800]  It will be basically the U.S. against most of the world on the Palestinian state.
[01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:16.800]  The U.S. would like to avoid this just about at any cost.
[01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:22.800]  So a lot of shenanigans will be staged in order to obfuscate what's going on with that.
[01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:27.800]  Exactly. If there's a terror attack hurting children, then, see,
[01:48:27.800 --> 01:48:30.800]  we can't have any statehood for anybody.
[01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:33.800]  Now continuing here, shifting gears...
[01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:37.800]  Wait, Alec, in the same breath, notice that we have the 12 Pirates now.
[01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:39.800]  The 12 Pirates are meeting in Washington, right?
[01:48:39.800 --> 01:48:41.800]  The Super Committee or Super Congress.
[01:48:41.800 --> 01:48:45.800]  This is an illegal Bonapartist committee. It's a step towards dictatorship.
[01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:50.800]  But if the 12 Pirates and the actual Congress and Obama can't agree
[01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:53.800]  on a program of genocide and austerity,
[01:48:53.800 --> 01:48:57.800]  then there's going to be a guillotine coming down on the Pentagon
[01:48:57.800 --> 01:49:00.800]  to the tune of about $60 billion per year.
[01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:06.800]  Now some would say that fact alone would motivate the Special Forces Underground,
[01:49:06.800 --> 01:49:12.800]  let's say, to go out and pull a false flag stunt just to make sure that they don't lose their budget.
[01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:17.800]  Oh, well, over the weekend you must have missed it in an audio interview with Human Events.
[01:49:17.800 --> 01:49:21.800]  Rumsfeld, we should play it later. It's up on infowars.com.
[01:49:21.800 --> 01:49:26.800]  Rumsfeld said, he came out and openly said,
[01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:30.800]  if you cut, in fact, put it on screen, guys, Human Events, Rumsfeld,
[01:49:30.800 --> 01:49:33.800]  if you cut defense budget, there will be another attack.
[01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:37.800]  That's like chaining on Meet the Press seven years ago saying,
[01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:42.800]  if there's a 9-11 investigation, there will be a nuclear attack.
[01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:47.800]  They are communicating to governments and agencies, yes, we're terrorists, we'll stage it.
[01:49:47.800 --> 01:49:50.800]  That's why they make these statements that are open.
[01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:54.800]  But where they can have double meaning, I meant we won't have the funds to protect you,
[01:49:54.800 --> 01:49:58.800]  there'll be a nuclear attack. But the way they state it, you cut our funding,
[01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:02.800]  but we're going to attack you. Very sickening.
[01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:06.800]  The other thing going on here in New York, a lot of stuff happening in the Big Apple.
[01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:10.800]  Out here in Forest Hills, out in Queens, and then into Brooklyn,
[01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:15.800]  we have the Anthony Weiner Congress seat as a representative,
[01:50:15.800 --> 01:50:18.800]  and that's an open seat now, so they're having a by-election.
[01:50:18.800 --> 01:50:24.800]  And it looks like the Republican, he's just a conservative party reactionary hack.
[01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:27.800]  But that would be a protest against Obama.
[01:50:27.800 --> 01:50:32.800]  And I say, if the Republican wins that seat out there in Queens,
[01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:35.800]  the Democratic Party has to dump Obama.
[01:50:35.800 --> 01:50:38.800]  There's got to be a candidate to challenge Obama in the primary.
[01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:44.800]  And there's more talk of Obama being thrown under the bus politically by the Democrats.
[01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:48.800]  Stay there, Webster, though. I want to get to Libya, because the Pentagon just announced,
[01:50:48.800 --> 01:50:51.800]  yes, they've got troops there. They're claiming they just arrived.
[01:50:51.800 --> 01:50:53.800]  We've known they've been there for six months.
[01:50:53.800 --> 01:51:15.800]  It's all part of lying to the American people. We'll be right back.
[01:51:24.800 --> 01:51:29.800]  Study show Alley C is effective against MRSA, bacterial, fungal, and viral infections.
[01:51:29.800 --> 01:51:33.800]  One tablet of Alley C has the equivalent of 40 cloves of garlic.

[01:52:23.800 --> 01:52:28.800]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the Info War.
[01:52:28.800 --> 01:52:32.800]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[01:52:32.800 --> 01:52:35.800]  The globalists are scared. They've overreached.
[01:52:35.800 --> 01:52:38.800]  The future of the Info War is in your hands.

[01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:56.800]  We are going to use their system against them.
[01:52:56.800 --> 01:53:18.800]  The Info War now goes into high gear.

[01:54:08.800 --> 01:54:12.800]  By the way, there's an article up at infowars.com.
[01:54:12.800 --> 01:54:23.800]  Headline, major studies out SpongeBob cause a short term attention problems and basically lowering of the IQ in children.
[01:54:23.800 --> 01:54:28.800]  If you watch children's cartoons now, it's all disjointed. It doesn't make sense.
[01:54:28.800 --> 01:54:37.800]  The characters look disjointed and twisted and people think, oh, that's just a new cool genre or style.
[01:54:37.800 --> 01:54:42.800]  No, it is about blurring reality and false reality.
[01:54:42.800 --> 01:54:47.800]  And with young developing minds, it can really screw them up.
[01:54:47.800 --> 01:54:52.800]  Art type, good clean fantasy, very good for the brain, very good for creativity.
[01:54:52.800 --> 01:55:02.800]  I've read the major studies, read books on the subject, but these disjointed things that don't make sense and then that's supposed to be funny for an adult, very detrimental to children's brains.
[01:55:02.800 --> 01:55:09.800]  Television watching itself leads to Alzheimer's brain damage. If you're watching a lot of it, it puts you in a rim state.
[01:55:09.800 --> 01:55:14.800]  That said, please subscribe to PrisonPlanet.tv and watch us on television.

[01:55:32.800 --> 01:55:38.800]  I know I'm really enjoying doing the show, condensing the information, focusing it down.
[01:55:38.800 --> 01:55:45.800]  The On the Street reporters, the video interviews. We're going to get more reporters. We're going to add more shows.

[01:56:16.800 --> 01:56:20.800]  And again, we'll be on tonight, 7 o'clock.
[01:56:20.800 --> 01:56:25.800]  All right, let's go back to Webster. Webster, quickly here. We have called it all with precision.
[01:56:25.800 --> 01:56:34.800]  NATO, U.S. troops were there six months ago, called advisors. Now they admit larger U.S. ground forces are going onto the ground.
[01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:41.800]  As we said in September, October, here it is. Turns out, Gaddafi, they've now gotten his intelligence briefs.
[01:56:41.800 --> 01:56:46.800]  He knew it was coming from intermediaries in Congress he was talking to.
[01:56:46.800 --> 01:56:50.800]  And here's Fox News. U.S. boots on the ground in Libya. Pentagon confirms.
[01:56:50.800 --> 01:56:56.800]  And former congressman says he saw NATO troops ahead Libyans, Walter Fontroy.
[01:56:56.800 --> 01:56:58.800]  What do you think of that, Webster? You've been there.
[01:56:58.800 --> 01:57:01.800]  Walter Fontroy, let me just say who that is. What a guy.
[01:57:01.800 --> 01:57:07.800]  The District of Columbia, as people know, does not have a voting member in the House, which of course they should.
[01:57:07.800 --> 01:57:12.800]  They should have two. They've got more people than Wyoming, so they should have two voting congressmen.
[01:57:12.800 --> 01:57:18.800]  But for a long time, they've had delegates. And Walter Fontroy is a veteran. He goes back to Martin Luther King.
[01:57:18.800 --> 01:57:23.800]  This is a fighter for civil rights, who has a very impressive record.
[01:57:23.800 --> 01:57:27.800]  And he was replaced some years back by Eleanor Holmes Norton here in the District.
[01:57:27.800 --> 01:57:31.800]  But he's kept up with the causes. And he was over there.
[01:57:31.800 --> 01:57:38.800]  And he was with Maki Darius, Nazem Rolaia, and Kenny Mason at Carinthia Hotel.
[01:57:38.800 --> 01:57:43.800]  And later on, moved around. And some of the other guys made it up through Malta
[01:57:43.800 --> 01:57:47.800]  on a harrowing 36-hour trip on the Mediterranean.
[01:57:47.800 --> 01:57:50.800]  But I guess Fontroy, I'm not up on the details right now with Fontroy.
[01:57:50.800 --> 01:57:54.800]  But I'm glad he's safe, because this is a person of great merit.
[01:57:54.800 --> 01:57:57.800]  And kind of an elder statesman of civil rights.
[01:57:57.800 --> 01:58:04.800]  No, because he was black. I was about to say, because he was black, he had to hide for a month because Al-Qaeda,
[01:58:04.800 --> 01:58:08.800]  under NATO command, was trying to kill him. And he watched out windows.
[01:58:08.800 --> 01:58:11.800]  He's now reporting as they murdered blacks en masse.
[01:58:11.800 --> 01:58:14.800]  He had to hide because Al-Qaeda was going to kill him.
[01:58:14.800 --> 01:58:19.800]  Absolutely. That's the, the Benghazi took root on Axis of Terror.
[01:58:19.800 --> 01:58:25.800]  And we know that the guy, this awful guy, Bill Hodge, he has got the Bill Hodge.
[01:58:25.800 --> 01:58:29.800]  That's all the same guy. He operates under numerous aliases, right?
[01:58:29.800 --> 01:58:34.800]  Stay there, Webster. Stay there. Stay there. Stay there. I'm going to do five more minutes with you.
[01:58:34.800 --> 01:58:59.800]  Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones. I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognized risk.
[01:58:59.800 --> 01:59:05.800]  To make money, the Calben Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps
[01:59:05.800 --> 01:59:09.800]  that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:59:09.800 --> 01:59:17.800]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:59:17.800 --> 01:59:25.800]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and a terrorizing clothing called lint.
[01:59:25.800 --> 01:59:30.800]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:59:30.800 --> 01:59:38.800]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091 or see Calben on the Web at 5starsoap.com.
[01:59:38.800 --> 02:00:00.800]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:00.800 --> 02:00:17.800]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.800 --> 02:00:22.800]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.800 --> 02:00:35.800]  You know, even if you want to put Al Qaeda in charge of Libya and give them tens of billions of dollars and heat-seeking missiles, you believe that's patriotic as the government says to do it.
[02:00:35.800 --> 02:00:43.800]  Still, you've been lied to. I mean, the West started the war, started the attempted overthrow. It was an unpopular uprising.
[02:00:43.800 --> 02:00:59.800]  We're now six-plus months into the Al Qaeda uprising, five months with the peace bombing effort launched by Lord Obama and, of course, the Italians and the French and the British.
[02:00:59.800 --> 02:01:02.800]  But now, here they are like we're idiots.
[02:01:02.800 --> 02:01:14.800]  U.S. boots on the ground in Libya, Pentagon confirms Fox News, despite repeated assurances from President Obama military leaders that U.S. would not send uniform military personnel in Libya, or U.S. service members arrived.
[02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:18.800]  Four U.S. service members arrived on the ground in Tripoli over the weekend.
[02:01:18.800 --> 02:01:33.800]  Or, I mean, three months ago, I had guests on who I confirmed who they were who said that there were dead U.S. troops coming in from Libya. And then foreign media videotape Europeans and Americans firing weapons.
[02:01:33.800 --> 02:01:38.800]  Webster, you were there during all of this. I mean, they talked to us like we're children, Webster.
[02:01:38.800 --> 02:01:51.800]  I believe the report was that a boat carrying U.S. and other NATO special forces arrived in Benghazi around the 15th or 16th or 17th of February, somewhere in there.
[02:01:51.800 --> 02:02:01.800]  You remember that Dutch special forces were captured, British special forces and MI6 were captured by, in some cases by the Benghazi rebels themselves.
[02:02:01.800 --> 02:02:12.800]  So, we've got the situation where the military commander of the city of Tripoli is Belhad Jassidi-Hastadi Ehad.
[02:02:12.800 --> 02:02:19.800]  Webster, your phone cut out. Are you there?
[02:02:19.800 --> 02:02:22.800]  We lost his cell. Calling backs. We can finish.
[02:02:22.800 --> 02:02:27.800]  Wow, look at this other news. Super Earth, one of 50 newfound planets.
[02:02:27.800 --> 02:02:36.800]  Newfound alien planets could potentially support life. Amazing. The stuff that our technology is discovering.
[02:02:36.800 --> 02:02:43.800]  The problem is we're lied to so much you never even know what's true anymore.
[02:02:43.800 --> 02:02:49.800]  Okay, now, Webster's going to get back on and finish, but just a few months ago he was in Libya while it was under bombardment.
[02:02:49.800 --> 02:02:58.800]  And I want him to be able to finish up on former congressman or congressional delegate from the District of Criminals.
[02:02:58.800 --> 02:03:09.800]  I saw NATO troops behead Libyans. Walter Fonttroy claims he saw NATO troops behead Libyans as part of a siege to overthrow Gaddafi's regime.
[02:03:09.800 --> 02:03:16.800]  A conflict he attributes the geopolitical agenda to recolonize Africa. Well, yeah, they want it for a big base.
[02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:20.800]  But hey, Obama's supposedly part of Africa, so it makes it okay.
[02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:26.800]  I mean, I guess if a black guy robs a black guy, is it all right? Or if a white guy robs a white guy?
[02:03:26.800 --> 02:03:31.800]  What if a Native American robs a Native American? Does that make it okay? No.
[02:03:31.800 --> 02:03:45.800]  But again, because of his color, and that's by the way what we said was going to happen, and what Tarpley said was going to happen in the Obama deception,
[02:03:45.800 --> 02:03:53.800]  is that Africa's going to be invaded and we show troops invading Libya and predict that Libya would be invaded in the Obama deception.
[02:03:53.800 --> 02:04:01.800]  More important now than two and a half years ago when I put it out, came out March 13, 2009.
[02:04:01.800 --> 02:04:07.800]  It was going to come out the 15th, but the FBI showed up here asking questions about it.
[02:04:07.800 --> 02:04:12.800]  And wouldn't say why, and I said, uh-oh, we better get it out now.
[02:04:12.800 --> 02:04:18.800]  And then people didn't believe the FBI had been here.
[02:04:18.800 --> 02:04:22.800]  And then of course later it came out the Associated Press that they had been here.
[02:04:22.800 --> 02:04:27.800]  People are like, this is a stunt for the Obama deception.
[02:04:27.800 --> 02:04:30.800]  Well, I'm sure going to break, we'll come back to you since your phone cut out.
[02:04:30.800 --> 02:04:38.800]  And I want you to finish up on this former congressional delegate, Congressman from District of Criminals, saying he saw all this.
[02:04:38.800 --> 02:04:43.800]  You know, Watson says he claimed it. Everything you said that was going on in Libya has now been proven.
[02:04:43.800 --> 02:04:45.800]  What he's saying has happened in other cases.
[02:04:45.800 --> 02:04:51.800]  I mean, you can question him, but I think it's prima facie right there on the face of it.
[02:04:51.800 --> 02:04:55.800]  We'll be right back. The website's ourprisonplanet.tv and infowars.com.
[02:04:55.800 --> 02:05:20.800]  Your calls and a mass of news.
[02:05:20.800 --> 02:05:29.800]  The power grid is dangerously overloaded, and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:05:29.800 --> 02:05:32.800]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:05:32.800 --> 02:05:36.800]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[02:05:36.800 --> 02:05:41.800]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:05:41.800 --> 02:05:46.800]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors.

[02:06:07.800 --> 02:06:12.800]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:06:12.800 --> 02:06:20.800]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:06:20.800 --> 02:06:29.800]  They so pride in every stitch guarantee you love the way they fit.
[02:06:29.800 --> 02:06:34.800]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[02:06:34.800 --> 02:06:39.800]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[02:06:39.800 --> 02:06:46.800]  We turn jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[02:07:09.800 --> 02:07:12.800]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:07:12.800 --> 02:07:17.800]  The United States has now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:07:17.800 --> 02:07:24.800]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:07:24.800 --> 02:07:30.800]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.
[02:07:30.800 --> 02:07:34.800]  The police state 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[02:07:34.800 --> 02:07:38.800]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:07:38.800 --> 02:07:44.800]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:07:44.800 --> 02:07:48.800]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:07:48.800 --> 02:07:51.800]  The police state isn't coming. It's here.

[02:08:08.800 --> 02:08:21.800]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[02:08:21.800 --> 02:08:30.800]  We're going to be on television tonight, 7 o'clock central every weeknight. What a commitment we have engaged in.

[02:08:38.800 --> 02:08:44.800]  We've got several very important news packages we're producing. I mean, this is real news that we're engaged in.

[02:09:21.800 --> 02:09:27.800]  There's going to be a whole new site with a whole bunch of other functions there at prismplanet.tv.
[02:09:27.800 --> 02:09:33.800]  We're going to begin migrating not away from prismplanet.tv, but with a whole new site.
[02:09:33.800 --> 02:09:42.800]  And so when you join one site, you're a member with both. That's basically what we're going to move towards or some other system similar to that,
[02:09:42.800 --> 02:09:46.800]  where you join one site and then get a passcode for the other.
[02:09:46.800 --> 02:09:54.800]  I believe in having multiple systems, multiple backups, but also variations to them.
[02:09:54.800 --> 02:10:00.800]  That's always been my gut instinct with media operations and it's held us in good stead.
[02:10:00.800 --> 02:10:09.800]  Also, we have had TV and different cable systems and folks interested in carrying a show, but I'm not ready yet.
[02:10:09.800 --> 02:10:14.800]  We're in the beta testing mode and you see all that at prismplanet.tv. We're getting a lot of new members.
[02:10:14.800 --> 02:10:19.800]  It looks good. It looks like we're on target to be able to continue our expansion if you continue to support us.
[02:10:19.800 --> 02:10:24.800]  So please, buy the great stainless steel water filters at infowars.com, Made in America.
[02:10:24.800 --> 02:10:29.800]  Buy the books, buy the videos, buy the materials and spread the word about the show and it's a win-win-win.
[02:10:29.800 --> 02:10:35.800]  You get materials to raise your awareness to a higher level, then you can pass on the book or the DVD or make copies of my films
[02:10:35.800 --> 02:10:39.800]  or Eremont Access Television or show them to your church or show them to your neighbor.
[02:10:39.800 --> 02:10:43.800]  Every person you wake up is invaluable in the fight against tyranny.
[02:10:43.800 --> 02:10:50.800]  But then it also makes our operation possible when you buy a water filter, a t-shirt, a ball cap, a video.
[02:10:50.800 --> 02:11:00.800]  And then all of it helps get the word out because it finances the radio show, the TV show, the media, the research, the graphics people, all of it.
[02:11:00.800 --> 02:11:06.800]  We are well above. We've got like 34 people now.
[02:11:06.800 --> 02:11:11.800]  That is a big nut to crack at the end of each month, but we're doing it.
[02:11:11.800 --> 02:11:17.800]  We also did something very, very exciting and I'm going back to finish with Webster Tarpley and then your calls and a bunch of news.
[02:11:17.800 --> 02:11:25.800]  I'm sick of flying and I'm sick of having my friends and family groped in front of me.
[02:11:25.800 --> 02:11:34.800]  And so I try to not drive, excuse me, I try to not fly, but still I have to sometimes in the interest of time.
[02:11:34.800 --> 02:11:40.800]  And people want me to travel and speak at radio stations. They want me to get on the road more.
[02:11:40.800 --> 02:11:45.800]  You know what? I'm going to announce it later in the week. I'm just going to leave it at that.
[02:11:45.800 --> 02:11:50.800]  I'll announce it later in the week. It's just that I am going to be doing more road trips, more speaking engagements.
[02:11:50.800 --> 02:11:55.800]  You want it, you got it. Okay? I'm just going to leave it at that.
[02:11:55.800 --> 02:12:04.800]  I'll be doing the TV show from the road. I mean, we've got a vehicle and I'm going to turn it into a communications hub.
[02:12:04.800 --> 02:12:11.800]  And we've got some ground transportation. I'll just leave it at that.
[02:12:11.800 --> 02:12:14.800]  Now we need to buy the equipment for it and get it all retrofitted and everything.
[02:12:14.800 --> 02:12:27.800]  It's a nice bus slash RV, but it looks like something out of a topless bar on the inside.
[02:12:27.800 --> 02:12:31.800]  It's pretty racy on the outside, but it was the best deal we could get.
[02:12:31.800 --> 02:12:41.800]  It's definitely a Millennium Falcon level. It's great, but it's also, you know, kind of, well, it's like 11 years old and definitely a pimp game type vehicle.
[02:12:41.800 --> 02:12:48.800]  So I've got a, and I'm not a flashy person, but it was the cheapest one we could get that had the quality.
[02:12:48.800 --> 02:12:52.800]  All right, side issue going, going to Tarpley.
[02:12:52.800 --> 02:13:04.800]  This is really unspeakably wild because it's backed up by what you witnessed. It's backed up by Reuters, even Washington Post, even Al Jazeera.
[02:13:04.800 --> 02:13:08.800]  That's pro war has had to admit, yeah, there's piles of dead black people everywhere.
[02:13:08.800 --> 02:13:15.800]  Women, children, men, they, they take them out and kill them, even though of course there's black Libyans.
[02:13:15.800 --> 02:13:22.800]  And you reported on that going on in the East months and months ago, it was confirmed, hanging black men from lamp poles.
[02:13:22.800 --> 02:13:38.800]  But we now have a well-known respected former U.S. Congressman or delegate from the District of Columbia, but technically a Congressman, Walter Fontroy, said that he had to hide out for a month that he was presumed dead for those that didn't know.
[02:13:38.800 --> 02:13:50.800]  And that he was having to hide out and took him a month to get out because blacks were being killed on the spot. And we know even Anglo reporters were being sniped and shot by Al Qaeda and NATO forces.
[02:13:50.800 --> 02:14:04.800]  This is a, this is a new level of war crime, but I guess because Obama is heading it up, there won't be any war crime charges because he's the man of peace, because he was given that peace price.
[02:14:04.800 --> 02:14:16.800]  I think it's, it's a tremendous embarrassment now for Obama in the black community to have an eyeball witness of the moral authority and historical status stature of delegate Fontroy.
[02:14:16.800 --> 02:14:21.800]  That's going to be something Obama will have to deal with. It's, it's been a hard one.
[02:14:21.800 --> 02:14:28.800]  The other thing is, these are the new vandals, right? The new, the new Al Qaeda rulers of Libya are like the vandals.
[02:14:28.800 --> 02:14:43.800]  Those were the ones, you know, they came out of Asia. They went all the way around through Spain and into North Africa. They took over Libya and then they started taking over Sicily and Sardinia and Corsica and that's who sacked Rome in 476.
[02:14:43.800 --> 02:14:51.800]  That's the end of the empire. So what you're going to have is Al Qaeda pirates in the Mediterranean and just a couple of examples.
[02:14:51.800 --> 02:14:58.800]  There's this guy Salabi, right? We just went through Bel Hodge. Bel Hodge is bad enough. Salabi came out a couple of days ago.
[02:14:58.800 --> 02:15:13.800]  He's another one of these terrorist commanders who's now, you know, the boss of Libya and he says that the former Gaddafi ministers in the, in the Benghazi rebel council are no longer acceptable to the killers.
[02:15:13.800 --> 02:15:24.800]  The gunmen want to get rid of these former Gaddafi guys and that means Chalil is the head of state and Chabriel is the head of government, the guy who pals around with Hillary Clinton.
[02:15:24.800 --> 02:15:37.800]  And it sounds to me like they're getting ready to, to eliminate those two. This guy, Salabi and Bel Hodge, those guys are prime suspects along with Hifter in the killing of Eunice, right?
[02:15:37.800 --> 02:15:53.800]  The military commander of the rebels was assassinated a little bit more than a month ago now and there were unconfirmed reports over the weekend that Chalil had been assassinated, that the head of state of the rebels had simply been gunned down.
[02:15:53.800 --> 02:16:07.800]  So the rebels are busy killing each other and Al Qaeda is starting to knock people out so they can fully take over and undoubtedly the West is going to be very proud of that and think that the public has no memory.
[02:16:07.800 --> 02:16:17.800]  And in a couple of years we'll be having to give up our liberties and invade Libya again to battle Al Qaeda and they'll probably even claim that Al Qaeda is working for Gaddafi or something.
[02:16:17.800 --> 02:16:29.800]  Here's another scenario. You get the Al Qaeda regime in Libya to invade Algeria and then the U.S. invades Algeria to protect them from Al Qaeda or some variation on that.
[02:16:29.800 --> 02:16:37.800]  Because remember, Algeria is now a target. That's another big country, big oil producer, very valuable place.
[02:16:37.800 --> 02:16:47.800]  Algeria has not supported the Al Qaeda rebellion in Libya at all and the U.S. is furious. They always wanted to overthrow Algeria.
[02:16:47.800 --> 02:16:57.800]  Algeria has 50,000 Chinese workers and the U.S. and the British want them kicked out. So Algeria, big target in the coming weeks.
[02:16:57.800 --> 02:17:09.800]  Very interesting Webster. But again, is there any way to start some type of war crimes movement for the racial genocide going on?
[02:17:09.800 --> 02:17:19.800]  But I mean, that's naive. The U.N. ran the Ivory Coast invasion that killed tens of thousands and admittedly their rebel forces were slaughtering people en masse.
[02:17:19.800 --> 02:17:23.800]  This is truly a criminal group drenched in blood at every level.
[02:17:23.800 --> 02:17:34.800]  I think that the stopping the support of Al Qaeda and stopping this imperialist interference should become an important program point in an emerging mass strike movement.
[02:17:34.800 --> 02:17:43.800]  And again, if we have the collapse of the European banking system over the next two months, which I think is more than likely, that will soon be followed by a banking panic in the United States.
[02:17:43.800 --> 02:17:57.800]  And then we will need to implement a recovery program and a mass strike. Like what began in Wisconsin in February, I think will come back on a much larger scale after having gone underground for six months or whatever it's been.
[02:17:57.800 --> 02:18:12.800]  And at that point, this will be some demand that can be raised. And 9-11 also gets fed into that. In other words, we want to stop the drills, stop the totalitarianism, stop false flag attacks.
[02:18:12.800 --> 02:18:27.800]  And that's part of the general movement to break the power of the Wall Street finance oligarchy, because that's the enemy, that's the goal. Wall Street, Wall Street, Wall Street. Fight bankers. That's the great point.
[02:18:27.800 --> 02:18:31.800]  Webster Carpley, thank you so much for joining us. I appreciate your analysis.
[02:18:31.800 --> 02:18:34.800]  Bye-bye, Alex. Congratulations on your program.
[02:18:34.800 --> 02:18:36.800]  Oh, the television show? Thank you, Webster.
[02:18:36.800 --> 02:18:50.800]  Well, I hope people spread the word about the TV show, because it really is going to reach millions and millions of people. It's already reaching. Well, it's already reached a couple million.
[02:18:50.800 --> 02:19:01.800]  We've been posting most of the nightly news a day later on the Alex Jones channel at PrisonPlanet.tv. So it's being posted at PrisonPlanet.tv immediately.
[02:19:01.800 --> 02:19:13.800]  It's being re-streamed after it first airs. But then it is also being posted over on the YouTube channel. Now, in the future, we're not going to post all of it.
[02:19:13.800 --> 02:19:23.800]  We're going to post highlights on the YouTube channel, because we have to wean ourselves away from YouTube to a certain point, because they are censoring people more and more.
[02:19:23.800 --> 02:19:41.800]  They are trying to restrict our accounts more and more. And so we've got to more and more focus on building up our own operation so that we can also capitalize and produce more shows that can then be deployed to different cable systems and satellite systems.
[02:19:41.800 --> 02:19:56.800]  And again, we're not going to be on the big marquee channels like Fox or whatever, but we will be here and there on systems reaching millions of people globally. So it's just another hydrahead that we're growing to attack the New World Order.
[02:19:56.800 --> 02:20:22.800]  I've got your calls straight ahead and I've got a bunch of news on the fires.
[02:20:22.800 --> 02:20:35.800]  Inorganic particles like lead, aluminum, even mercury, and remove these accumulated poisons from your body go to waterwebinar.com, a water secret so powerful some have called it the number one threat to the entire New World Order health agenda.
[02:20:35.800 --> 02:20:47.800]  It was even used during Chernobyl to clean up nuclear contamination. Go to waterwebinar.com now and sign up for free to find out how to turn the worst water on this planet into pristine clear drinking water which heals your body.
[02:20:47.800 --> 02:21:00.800]  You can take your water freedom into your own hands and defend yourself and your family from the globalist health agenda. Don't get left behind. It's your life, your water, your freedom. Fight for it. Go to waterwebinar.com now.
[02:21:17.800 --> 02:21:31.800]  But we can't do that without your help. By getting the films, bumper stickers and t-shirts and infowars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[02:21:31.800 --> 02:21:40.800]  We need your help to spread the word like never before. They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[02:21:40.800 --> 02:22:00.800]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination. The war is here. It's an info war. The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[02:22:00.800 --> 02:22:15.800]  This is not a drill. Repeat. This is not a drill. Gun cells are on a staggering pace. Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[02:22:15.800 --> 02:22:29.800]  Now, a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters. You'll learn step by step, battle-hardened techniques, where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them, how to create the perfect hiding place as well as the places you should never hide your guns.
[02:22:29.800 --> 02:22:38.800]  Under any circumstance, these and other closely guarded gun caching secrets are guaranteed to keep your weapons safe and out of sight when the going gets tough.
[02:22:38.800 --> 02:22:45.800]  But listen up. For security reasons, the Hide Your Guns book and even the website may disappear without warning at any time.
[02:22:45.800 --> 02:23:00.800]  Go to hideyourguns.com or call 877-327-0365 before they come for your guns. Hideyourguns.com right now.
[02:23:16.800 --> 02:23:27.800]  Baby, you're a rich man. Baby, you're a rich man. Baby, you're a rich man too.
[02:23:27.800 --> 02:23:37.800]  Don't come knocking when your good friends lock you out.
[02:23:37.800 --> 02:23:48.800]  Life Before the Collapse by The Lost Vegas on 180-gram vinyl and mastered especially for vinyl by legendary audio engineer Steve Hall.
[02:23:48.800 --> 02:23:52.800]  This guy, why don't want me to this guy?
[02:23:52.800 --> 02:23:56.800]  Life Before the Collapse by The Lost Vegas. The Lost Vegas.
[02:23:56.800 --> 02:24:07.800]  Now available at amazon.com.
[02:24:26.800 --> 02:24:36.800]  Life Before the Collapse by The Lost Vegas on 180-gram vinyl and mastered.
[02:24:57.800 --> 02:25:06.800]  We'll be talking to Luke briefly. I want to go to Austin, Swiss guy Steve, Freddie and Jason.
[02:25:06.800 --> 02:25:09.800]  We'll at least get to you guys before Luke joins us.
[02:25:09.800 --> 02:25:14.800]  And then I have other news here that I don't know if I can do justice to this in the time we have.
[02:25:14.800 --> 02:25:20.800]  Ron Paul called him a nut out of the Washington Post. That's the headline.
[02:25:20.800 --> 02:25:28.800]  And then the reasons he's a nut is he says the currency's been devalued. And the guy goes on to say that's insane.
[02:25:28.800 --> 02:25:37.800]  Now for anyone who has common sense, you know this is an insane article where the person is an unintellectual fool, Eric Wimple.
[02:25:37.800 --> 02:25:46.800]  Mr. Wimple. But this guy may have a wimpy psychological makeup, but he doesn't.
[02:25:46.800 --> 02:25:50.800]  He knows full well that that's a real problem we face and going on.
[02:25:50.800 --> 02:25:54.800]  I mean, you can listen to the financial channels. That's all they talk about.
[02:25:54.800 --> 02:26:01.800]  So what is he doing there? He thinks his audience are a bunch of idiots.
[02:26:01.800 --> 02:26:07.800]  Oh look, that guy's a kook. He said buy gold and it's up 900%.
[02:26:07.800 --> 02:26:21.800]  Crazy person. It'd be like if you were a NFL scout and you scouted, you know, one of the greatest quarterbacks in history.
[02:26:21.800 --> 02:26:27.800]  And everybody's like, haha, you know, he made an incredibly good scouting choice.
[02:26:27.800 --> 02:26:34.800]  He's a cook. Oh, this guy made a stock market bet that made him a thousand times the money back. He's crazy.
[02:26:34.800 --> 02:26:38.800]  They do that more and more. It's all just about the laughing.
[02:26:38.800 --> 02:26:45.800]  The guy's crazy. Just counting on readers to go, oh, well, he's a cook.
[02:26:45.800 --> 02:26:49.800]  It's cookie to say silver's a good investment. I've got that.
[02:26:49.800 --> 02:26:55.800]  And then I've got this. You know, I see these articles all the time and never really get into it.
[02:26:55.800 --> 02:27:03.800]  And I know that there are really about six, seven different groups of gypsies around the world.
[02:27:03.800 --> 02:27:07.800]  But all the time I read about stuff they're up to, depending on which group it is.
[02:27:07.800 --> 02:27:17.800]  And then in Austin, it's real politically correct to say it's a lie and that it's discrimination and that gypsies don't ever do anything wrong.
[02:27:17.800 --> 02:27:25.800]  And that's just not true. And people culturally need to tell folks this behavior is wrong so that it isn't done anymore.
[02:27:25.800 --> 02:27:29.800]  I mean, are there Christian groups of gypsies and different groups that aren't involved in crime?
[02:27:29.800 --> 02:27:33.800]  Yes, I've actually researched this topic and there are a lot of them that aren't.
[02:27:33.800 --> 02:27:38.800]  But still, there are the groups that believe it's culturally okay to do it.
[02:27:38.800 --> 02:27:41.800]  My wife grew up in Europe. She lived in five different countries.
[02:27:41.800 --> 02:27:48.800]  My parents have been to Europe a lot. I've never had any run-ins when I've been in Europe, but they say that, yeah, it's bad.
[02:27:48.800 --> 02:27:53.800]  I mean, they'll come grab your purse away, grab your food right off your plate, demand money.
[02:27:53.800 --> 02:28:00.800]  And whenever national TV shows clips of it, they'll always call them Spanish or Italians.
[02:28:00.800 --> 02:28:05.800]  No, no, no. And then blame the Spanish or the Italians. No, it's gypsies.
[02:28:05.800 --> 02:28:13.800]  And this is political correctness where the Post Office won't deliver Bibles now saying that they're homophobic in England.
[02:28:13.800 --> 02:28:17.800]  That's in the news. That was in the Daily Mail yesterday.
[02:28:17.800 --> 02:28:27.800]  But then this headline, Travelers who kept and starved slaves, produced one who was on the brink of committing suicide from a bridge.
[02:28:27.800 --> 02:28:29.800]  And that's how police discovered it.
[02:28:29.800 --> 02:28:41.800]  And they had all these people kept in dog kennels and horse boxes covered in feces who would be delivered out of the caravans to work from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.
[02:28:41.800 --> 02:28:47.800]  Recovering driveways and things like that. That's a classic traveler.
[02:28:47.800 --> 02:28:51.800]  By the way, I've been told you're not even supposed to say the name Gypsy.
[02:28:51.800 --> 02:28:57.800]  Because that, it's like Dincor changed their name for a while.
[02:28:57.800 --> 02:29:04.800]  Of course, they're corporations, so they can't say it's racist to call us Dincor or Monsanto changed their name for a while, then changed it back.
[02:29:04.800 --> 02:29:07.800]  It's like a name that's a bad connotation and you're not supposed to say it.
[02:29:07.800 --> 02:29:15.800]  And there's a lot of different cultures of travelers. Not all of them are the folks who came from India probably about 1500 years ago.
[02:29:15.800 --> 02:29:20.800]  And a lot of Gypsies have groups. I find it fascinating.
[02:29:20.800 --> 02:29:28.800]  I think I'm going to get some experts on, including the UT professor who's like one of the leaders of the Gypsies on.
[02:29:28.800 --> 02:29:36.800]  But they found two dozen modern day slaves kept in dog kennels covered in feces.
[02:29:36.800 --> 02:29:40.800]  Well, they deserved it because the travelers can do no wrong.
[02:29:40.800 --> 02:29:43.800]  This is their culture to kidnap people. Come on.
[02:29:43.800 --> 02:30:10.800]  Most people deserve to live in dog cages. Anybody that criticizes is racist.
[02:30:10.800 --> 02:30:15.800]  Very different. People are using this great food to survive the present hurricane season.
[02:30:15.800 --> 02:30:21.800]  And we've already had $40 billion worth of damage from floods, storms, quakes and droughts.
[02:30:21.800 --> 02:30:23.800]  And that's just the first eight months of this year.
[02:30:23.800 --> 02:30:27.800]  Natural disasters are newsworthy, but only touch a few of us Americans.
[02:30:27.800 --> 02:30:31.800]  The huge issue of the greatest depression is on everyone's mind.
[02:30:31.800 --> 02:30:39.800]  The unemployment, the loss of homes, lost businesses and skyrocketing food costs are hitting every American, so everyone needs food security.

[02:31:00.800 --> 02:31:08.800]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:31:08.800 --> 02:31:10.800]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:31:10.800 --> 02:31:16.800]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:31:16.800 --> 02:31:19.800]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:31:19.800 --> 02:31:21.800]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:31:21.800 --> 02:31:27.800]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:31:27.800 --> 02:31:31.800]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:31:31.800 --> 02:31:37.800]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:31:37.800 --> 02:31:38.800]  It's a real eye-opener.
[02:31:38.800 --> 02:31:39.800]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:31:39.800 --> 02:31:42.800]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:31:42.800 --> 02:31:46.800]  He explains everything you need to know including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:31:46.800 --> 02:31:51.800]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:31:51.800 --> 02:31:53.800]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[02:31:53.800 --> 02:31:57.800]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:31:57.800 --> 02:31:59.800]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:32:00.800 --> 02:32:05.800]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[02:32:05.800 --> 02:32:08.800]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming.
[02:32:08.800 --> 02:32:12.800]  And I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[02:32:12.800 --> 02:32:14.800]  Number one, study the past.
[02:32:14.800 --> 02:32:16.800]  History really does repeat itself.
[02:32:16.800 --> 02:32:21.800]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[02:32:21.800 --> 02:32:24.800]  Number three, take decisive action.
[02:32:24.800 --> 02:32:28.800]  A perfect storm is brewing or a global food crisis.
[02:32:28.800 --> 02:32:35.800]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book Rising Prices, Empty Shelves, Warning Signs,
[02:32:35.800 --> 02:32:37.800]  that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[02:32:37.800 --> 02:32:41.800]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[02:32:41.800 --> 02:32:45.800]  This book is only available at RisingPricesEmptyShelves.com.
[02:32:45.800 --> 02:32:48.800]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival,
[02:32:48.800 --> 02:32:50.800]  how to cut your grocery bills in half.
[02:32:50.800 --> 02:32:55.800]  Again, that website is RisingPricesEmptyShelves.com.
[02:32:55.800 --> 02:32:58.800]  That's RisingPricesEmptyShelves.com.
[02:32:58.800 --> 02:33:24.800]  That's right, the big dogs moving to television.
[02:33:24.800 --> 02:33:28.800]  We're beta testing it at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:33:28.800 --> 02:33:31.800]  If you're not a subscriber and a member, please become one today.
[02:33:31.800 --> 02:33:33.800]  We'll be on the 9th, 7 o'clock central.
[02:33:33.800 --> 02:33:36.800]  All right, I promise I'm going to your calls right now ahead of Lick Radowski.
[02:33:36.800 --> 02:33:38.800]  Swiss guy got to talk to you.
[02:33:38.800 --> 02:33:40.800]  Austin, Freddie, Steve, we're going to get to everybody.
[02:33:40.800 --> 02:33:43.800]  We're about to go into overdrive, but we're going to do it right now.
[02:33:43.800 --> 02:33:46.800]  I just want to finish this article.
[02:33:46.800 --> 02:33:47.800]  This is the Daily Mail.
[02:33:47.800 --> 02:33:57.800]  Travelers, that's gypsies, it doesn't say which tribe, who kept and starved slaves,
[02:33:57.800 --> 02:34:01.800]  rescued one who was on the brink of committing suicide from a bridge,
[02:34:01.800 --> 02:34:03.800]  vulnerable victims lured from soup kitchens,
[02:34:03.800 --> 02:34:05.800]  benefit offices, and hostels.
[02:34:05.800 --> 02:34:08.800]  Slaves kept in filthy kennels and horse boxes.
[02:34:08.800 --> 02:34:10.800]  One held for 15 years.
[02:34:10.800 --> 02:34:13.800]  Five people from the traveler's site arrested.
[02:34:13.800 --> 02:34:17.800]  Two dozen modern-day slaves held in appalling conditions were rescued
[02:34:17.800 --> 02:34:20.800]  when police raided a traveler's camp yesterday.
[02:34:20.800 --> 02:34:26.800]  About 200 officers stormed the site where the men were kept in filthy caravans,
[02:34:26.800 --> 02:34:28.800]  dog kennels, and horse boxes.
[02:34:28.800 --> 02:34:30.800]  Some were starving.
[02:34:30.800 --> 02:34:34.800]  The vulnerable victims had been lured from soup kitchens, benefit offices,
[02:34:34.800 --> 02:34:37.800]  and hostels with promises of paid jobs and shelter.
[02:34:37.800 --> 02:34:41.800]  That's how Dinecore and others have been caught kidnapping women all over Europe.
[02:34:41.800 --> 02:34:44.800]  These people's problems are they didn't go work for the New World Order.
[02:34:44.800 --> 02:34:48.800]  They could fly first class in jets and kidnap whoever they want.
[02:34:48.800 --> 02:34:53.800]  Openly, CPS openly ships kids out of the U.S. every day to their tortured deaths
[02:34:53.800 --> 02:34:56.800]  and it's just like, hey, we're the U.S. government.
[02:34:56.800 --> 02:35:01.800]  Instead, they became slaves after their masters beat them into submission,
[02:35:01.800 --> 02:35:04.800]  stole their possessions, and shaved their heads.
[02:35:04.800 --> 02:35:07.800]  They were put to work in grueling manual labor jobs,
[02:35:07.800 --> 02:35:11.800]  paving driveways, and clearing rubble because they were deemed cheaper
[02:35:11.800 --> 02:35:14.800]  than hiring machinery from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.
[02:35:14.800 --> 02:35:17.800]  At least one man had been kept as a slave for 15 years.
[02:35:17.800 --> 02:35:19.800]  Another was found with dog extra men all over his clothes.
[02:35:19.800 --> 02:35:23.800]  Investigators are now working to uncover the true scale of the harm
[02:35:23.800 --> 02:35:27.800]  and the speculation that there may have been hundreds of victims,
[02:35:27.800 --> 02:35:32.800]  as if people don't know when they pull up and let somebody out of a cage to clean their yard.
[02:35:32.800 --> 02:35:37.800]  But see, there's no, see something, say something campaign for this.
[02:35:37.800 --> 02:35:40.800]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:35:40.800 --> 02:35:44.800]  And I'll just say this in closing.
[02:35:44.800 --> 02:35:50.800]  People who claim that this is not gypsy culture need to decry it and speak out against it
[02:35:50.800 --> 02:35:54.800]  instead of running around all over TV, because I've kind of made an interesting study
[02:35:54.800 --> 02:35:58.800]  that's going to find it interesting, lecturing everyone that it isn't true
[02:35:58.800 --> 02:36:02.800]  that this is part of the culture that it's okay to rob and steal from people.
[02:36:02.800 --> 02:36:06.800]  If this isn't your culture, then you need to speak out against it instead of saying it didn't go on.
[02:36:06.800 --> 02:36:16.800]  Because I see stuff like this every few weeks, and then anybody who criticizes it is attacked.
[02:36:16.800 --> 02:36:18.800]  And gypsy groups that are not into this kind of stuff,
[02:36:18.800 --> 02:36:22.800]  and I've did some research, there are some that actually aren't involved in this stuff,
[02:36:22.800 --> 02:36:27.800]  you need to speak out against it instead of going around saying it isn't happening.
[02:36:27.800 --> 02:36:29.800]  This is a big issue.
[02:36:29.800 --> 02:36:34.800]  And look, every culture gets the attitude of everybody else is scum, we can do this.
[02:36:34.800 --> 02:36:38.800]  The Native Americans were treated like they were scum by white people.
[02:36:38.800 --> 02:36:40.800]  That's wrong, okay?
[02:36:40.800 --> 02:36:43.800]  It was wrong in the culture to say that.
[02:36:43.800 --> 02:36:47.800]  Every other tribe or group thinks that they're better than everybody.
[02:36:47.800 --> 02:36:50.800]  The point is we need to be honest about this, just like Aztec culture.
[02:36:50.800 --> 02:36:53.800]  People say, don't judge, you can't judge a culture.
[02:36:53.800 --> 02:36:57.800]  Well, the Nazis had a bad culture, the Aztecs would sacrifice their children.
[02:36:57.800 --> 02:37:00.800]  I'm going to make a moral decision and that's bad.
[02:37:00.800 --> 02:37:04.800]  And I've had university professors attack me for criticizing Aztecs.
[02:37:04.800 --> 02:37:07.800]  Well, I'm against the druids sacrificing their children.
[02:37:07.800 --> 02:37:10.800]  I mean, those are white people.
[02:37:10.800 --> 02:37:13.800]  You see, the system doesn't want you to be able to make a moral judgment
[02:37:13.800 --> 02:37:15.800]  because they want to make all the judgments for you.
[02:37:15.800 --> 02:37:22.800]  They say there are no morals, but then they moralize to you all day, okay?
[02:37:22.800 --> 02:37:28.800]  And I've had friends, I've had family robbed by Gypsies in Europe.
[02:37:28.800 --> 02:37:33.800]  My wife lived in Rome for six years.
[02:37:33.800 --> 02:37:37.800]  So don't tell her that that isn't going on.
[02:37:37.800 --> 02:37:38.800]  Don't tell these people.
[02:37:38.800 --> 02:37:41.800]  See, it's time to stop being politically correct.
[02:37:41.800 --> 02:37:45.800]  It's time to stop it.
[02:37:45.800 --> 02:37:47.800]  And it's just like with cops.
[02:37:47.800 --> 02:37:50.800]  When there's bad cops on the force and people let that become the culture,
[02:37:50.800 --> 02:37:53.800]  it makes all the cops look bad.
[02:37:53.800 --> 02:37:57.800]  And it's the same thing with the diverse traveler culture.
[02:37:57.800 --> 02:38:01.800]  I know there's a whole bunch of groups and a lot of the subgroups
[02:38:01.800 --> 02:38:05.800]  and other groups get blamed for some of the other criminal groups.
[02:38:05.800 --> 02:38:07.800]  The point is, is that it needs to be exposed.
[02:38:07.800 --> 02:38:10.800]  It needs to be talked about before it gets out of control.
[02:38:10.800 --> 02:38:13.800]  Let's go ahead and talk to Austin in Arizona.
[02:38:13.800 --> 02:38:14.800]  Austin, you're on the air.
[02:38:14.800 --> 02:38:15.800]  Go ahead.
[02:38:15.800 --> 02:38:17.800]  Hey, Alex, how you doing?
[02:38:17.800 --> 02:38:19.800]  Good. Thanks for holding.
[02:38:19.800 --> 02:38:24.800]  Hey, so I wanted to make a comment and I had a quick video that I wanted to,
[02:38:24.800 --> 02:38:26.800]  that I wanted to play on if I could.
[02:38:26.800 --> 02:38:28.800]  I don't know if we have time to go ahead.
[02:38:28.800 --> 02:38:31.800]  Okay. Let me play the video real quick.
[02:38:31.800 --> 02:38:32.800]  It's only a couple of seconds.
[02:38:32.800 --> 02:38:34.800]  It's from ny1.com.
[02:38:34.800 --> 02:38:39.800]  And it talks about how the police are manipulating crime statistics
[02:38:39.800 --> 02:38:43.800]  and the corruption of the police here today.
[02:38:43.800 --> 02:38:46.800]  The Village Voice is releasing some shocking recordings,
[02:38:46.800 --> 02:38:49.800]  many inside of Brooklyn Police Precinct.
[02:38:49.800 --> 02:38:52.800]  The Voice says that they have shown precinct bosses pressuring Austin
[02:38:52.800 --> 02:38:56.800]  to make their monthly photos of arrests,
[02:38:56.800 --> 02:39:03.800]  and urging officers to report fewer actual crimes in order to manipulate crime statistics.
[02:39:03.800 --> 02:39:05.800]  Yeah, no, that goes on everywhere.
[02:39:05.800 --> 02:39:08.800]  They cover up real crime, they release violent offenders,
[02:39:08.800 --> 02:39:13.800]  and they keep nonviolent all over the U.S. in prison longer than violent.
[02:39:13.800 --> 02:39:18.800]  They want violence out causing mayhem to scare the public to want more police in prison.
[02:39:18.800 --> 02:39:20.800]  They want the nonviolent building widgets.
[02:39:20.800 --> 02:39:22.800]  And yes, I was aware of that New York City.
[02:39:22.800 --> 02:39:23.800]  It's come out everywhere.
[02:39:23.800 --> 02:39:25.800]  The cops have put full page ads in saying,
[02:39:25.800 --> 02:39:30.800]  we don't want to arrest a pregnant woman for sitting on a bench more than five minutes.
[02:39:30.800 --> 02:39:33.800]  We don't want to arrest an old lady for throwing a newspaper in the trash.
[02:39:33.800 --> 02:39:36.800]  We're ordered to go after non-criminals.
[02:39:36.800 --> 02:39:39.800]  So in fairness to the police, they don't like it either.
[02:39:39.800 --> 02:39:41.800]  Go ahead.
[02:39:41.800 --> 02:39:45.800]  Right, and I also wanted to point out that, you know,
[02:39:45.800 --> 02:39:50.800]  I think that the biggest change that needs to happen with society
[02:39:50.800 --> 02:39:53.800]  is I think we need to get back to the basics.
[02:39:53.800 --> 02:39:58.800]  And, you know, what I mean is I think that we need to start bringing back the community,
[02:39:58.800 --> 02:40:00.800]  and we need to start bringing back the family,
[02:40:00.800 --> 02:40:04.800]  because we can change the government, which is good, and restore the republic.
[02:40:04.800 --> 02:40:10.800]  But if we still don't have unity, then, you know, I don't see how it could hold up, you know.
[02:40:10.800 --> 02:40:13.800]  I agree with you. Great points. Thank you so much, sir.
[02:40:13.800 --> 02:40:16.800]  Really fabulous points and so simple.
[02:40:16.800 --> 02:40:18.800]  Let's talk to Swiss guy in Switzerland.
[02:40:18.800 --> 02:40:21.800]  Thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[02:40:21.800 --> 02:40:23.800]  Yes. Hi, Alex.
[02:40:23.800 --> 02:40:24.800]  Hi, welcome.
[02:40:24.800 --> 02:40:28.800]  I'm from Switzerland, and I really appreciate your show.
[02:40:28.800 --> 02:40:30.800]  I follow you since a while.
[02:40:30.800 --> 02:40:34.800]  And just to say that even in Switzerland, the people are struggling
[02:40:34.800 --> 02:40:36.800]  and the people are watching what you are doing.
[02:40:36.800 --> 02:40:47.800]  And first, how we say, a big up to the whole crew of Infowar and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:40:47.800 --> 02:40:52.800]  And first, I have one request.
[02:40:52.800 --> 02:40:56.800]  One request is that a lot of people of whole international,
[02:40:56.800 --> 02:40:58.800]  of the whole world watching you.
[02:40:58.800 --> 02:41:02.800]  And I think it would be nice if you have some more coverage
[02:41:02.800 --> 02:41:07.800]  of international news or happenings.
[02:41:07.800 --> 02:41:12.800]  I think it's, I know that it's the proximity for you.
[02:41:12.800 --> 02:41:14.800]  It's really important to have...
[02:41:14.800 --> 02:41:19.800]  Well, I mean, remember, the United States is the center of the global empire now.
[02:41:19.800 --> 02:41:22.800]  And so it's kind of like we're in the middle of Rome and the Roman Empire.
[02:41:22.800 --> 02:41:27.800]  But I agree with you that we should cover more of what's happening around the world.
[02:41:27.800 --> 02:41:31.800]  But whatever's happening here is being duplicated where you're at.
[02:41:31.800 --> 02:41:34.800]  This is a global system.
[02:41:34.800 --> 02:41:36.800]  Definitely, I agree.
[02:41:36.800 --> 02:41:38.800]  And we see it like today.
[02:41:38.800 --> 02:41:39.800]  We watch every day.
[02:41:39.800 --> 02:41:41.800]  We watch the stock market.
[02:41:41.800 --> 02:41:43.800]  And we see it like how it goes.
[02:41:43.800 --> 02:41:50.800]  And here is like 3 o'clock in the afternoon when the stock market in Europe, in U.S. open.
[02:41:50.800 --> 02:41:52.800]  And we are watching it closely.
[02:41:52.800 --> 02:41:54.800]  And we see it every time how it goes.
[02:41:54.800 --> 02:41:58.800]  Anyway, I just have to request that the important thing is also
[02:41:58.800 --> 02:42:01.800]  that a lot of things happening worldwide.
[02:42:01.800 --> 02:42:06.800]  And I think it would be nice if you have some maybe international correspondence
[02:42:06.800 --> 02:42:09.800]  that would talk to you per Skype or something.
[02:42:09.800 --> 02:42:13.800]  Because I agree that U.S. is like the whole global system,
[02:42:13.800 --> 02:42:15.800]  catch the whole global system.
[02:42:15.800 --> 02:42:20.800]  But a lot of side effects coming to Europe,
[02:42:20.800 --> 02:42:23.800]  coming to different countries in the whole world.
[02:42:23.800 --> 02:42:26.800]  And I think your show is so important and so great.
[02:42:26.800 --> 02:42:32.800]  Well, Swiss guy, you're even nice to call in and stay on hold and I appreciate you.
[02:42:32.800 --> 02:42:35.800]  I mean, we do cover international issues.
[02:42:35.800 --> 02:42:38.800]  We probably should cover more because it's a very small planet.
[02:42:38.800 --> 02:42:42.800]  As you know, a lot of the bailout money went to foreign banks
[02:42:42.800 --> 02:42:45.800]  because it's foreign banks that have taken over the U.S.
[02:42:45.800 --> 02:42:47.800]  They've taken over your country.
[02:42:47.800 --> 02:42:52.800]  And I know that dollar devaluation worldwide has been driving up your Swiss franc.
[02:42:52.800 --> 02:42:54.800]  So now you've had to devalue it.
[02:42:54.800 --> 02:43:00.800]  So certainly it's the very same banksters and their fractional reserve system
[02:43:00.800 --> 02:43:02.800]  that is hammering us all.
[02:43:02.800 --> 02:43:08.800]  We have covered, of course, the reactor or not reactor nuclear processing plant
[02:43:08.800 --> 02:43:10.800]  exploding today in France.
[02:43:10.800 --> 02:43:12.800]  We've been covering Libya.
[02:43:12.800 --> 02:43:16.800]  We've been covering Iran.
[02:43:16.800 --> 02:43:23.800]  So, I mean, I would say we're actually pretty heavily balanced towards foreign news.
[02:43:23.800 --> 02:43:27.800]  But there's so much interesting news happening overseas.
[02:43:27.800 --> 02:43:30.800]  Give me some examples of some news you'd like to see us cover.
[02:43:30.800 --> 02:43:36.800]  They would cover up some stories from outside like calling by phone.
[02:43:36.800 --> 02:43:38.800]  Your night show is really great.
[02:43:38.800 --> 02:43:40.800]  And it's just a suggestion.
[02:43:40.800 --> 02:43:43.800]  I mean, maybe you can just make a call up from some guys
[02:43:43.800 --> 02:43:46.800]  who have already video programs or something open.
[02:43:46.800 --> 02:43:48.800]  And that is just an idea.
[02:43:48.800 --> 02:43:50.800]  But I have another issue.
[02:43:50.800 --> 02:43:54.800]  I really appreciate your show and I follow you every day,
[02:43:54.800 --> 02:43:57.800]  a couple of times through your website, infowar.com.
[02:43:57.800 --> 02:44:01.800]  And just one thing is really, like you say,
[02:44:01.800 --> 02:44:05.800]  we have informed ourselves about what's happening in the world and stuff.
[02:44:05.800 --> 02:44:09.800]  And I just watched like a seven-hour DVD about 9-11
[02:44:09.800 --> 02:44:12.800]  where they say there was even no plane around.
[02:44:12.800 --> 02:44:16.800]  And I saw some videos where it's only explosions and no video.
[02:44:16.800 --> 02:44:23.800]  Anyway, but the thing is that your website is in red, blue and white.
[02:44:23.800 --> 02:44:28.800]  And this is my biggest issue because when I coming back to your website
[02:44:28.800 --> 02:44:34.800]  after this six-hour DVD, I realized that these colors are the freemasons colors.
[02:44:34.800 --> 02:44:41.800]  And I'm personally quite shocked because I know I hope you don't do that because of this.
[02:44:41.800 --> 02:44:46.800]  But I think definitely they have to be a change to do your new website
[02:44:46.800 --> 02:44:48.800]  and your stuff is really good.
[02:44:48.800 --> 02:44:54.800]  But these colors have to disappear because these colors are red and white are the freemasons.
[02:44:54.800 --> 02:44:55.800]  Sure, Swiss guy.
[02:44:55.800 --> 02:44:57.800]  Look, I appreciate your call.
[02:44:57.800 --> 02:44:59.800]  We're going to go to Luke Radowski and then back to your calls.
[02:44:59.800 --> 02:45:03.800]  Freddie, CJ, Steve and Jason will at least get to those calls
[02:45:03.800 --> 02:45:05.800]  before we end the transmission today.
[02:45:05.800 --> 02:45:08.800]  But I want to get an update on what happened on Ground Zero.
[02:45:08.800 --> 02:45:10.800]  I am not scripted.
[02:45:10.800 --> 02:45:12.800]  I don't have a teleprompter.
[02:45:12.800 --> 02:45:18.800]  I don't screen your phone calls.
[02:45:18.800 --> 02:45:21.800]  We're not into color theory and things like that.
[02:45:21.800 --> 02:45:25.800]  We're not into subliminals.
[02:45:25.800 --> 02:45:29.800]  You know, I've had graphic people before kind of copy TV and have some fast moving stuff
[02:45:29.800 --> 02:45:31.800]  and people say, hey, that's subliminal.
[02:45:31.800 --> 02:45:34.800]  Well, that's just us copying television style.
[02:45:34.800 --> 02:45:37.800]  As for red, white and blue being Mason colors,
[02:45:37.800 --> 02:45:40.800]  I mean, I think in Masonic stuff, there's all sorts of color use.
[02:45:40.800 --> 02:45:43.800]  Obviously, our country's color is red, white and blue.
[02:45:43.800 --> 02:45:45.800]  The French colors are red, white and blue.
[02:45:45.800 --> 02:45:47.800]  I like blue and white.
[02:45:47.800 --> 02:45:51.800]  And I told Kurt Nemo when he redesigned Info Wars years ago,
[02:45:51.800 --> 02:45:54.800]  I said, I want it to look like blue and white.
[02:45:54.800 --> 02:45:57.800]  And I want to have a map of the world at the top.
[02:45:57.800 --> 02:45:59.800]  And he did a couple of different variants.
[02:45:59.800 --> 02:46:01.800]  I said, I like that.
[02:46:01.800 --> 02:46:02.800]  So I like blue and white.
[02:46:02.800 --> 02:46:05.800]  And then there I guess sometimes when the story is really important,
[02:46:05.800 --> 02:46:08.800]  we copy the Drudge Report where he red links something.
[02:46:08.800 --> 02:46:12.800]  So I guess, yeah, I'm like, hey, add a function where if something's really important,
[02:46:12.800 --> 02:46:14.800]  it's a red link.
[02:46:14.800 --> 02:46:17.800]  And so, yeah, then you get red, white and blue.
[02:46:17.800 --> 02:46:20.800]  But I don't even really know that that's some coded color,
[02:46:20.800 --> 02:46:23.800]  but I believe you've done research and know something I don't know.
[02:46:23.800 --> 02:46:27.800]  But it's, I mean, the site's got green on it.
[02:46:27.800 --> 02:46:32.800]  I've worn green shirts before and get emails saying I'm a secret jihadist
[02:46:32.800 --> 02:46:34.800]  because I'm wearing green.
[02:46:34.800 --> 02:46:36.800]  Green is my favorite color.
[02:46:36.800 --> 02:46:44.800]  I'm a Christian, but if that's proof that I'm a jihadi, then so be it.
[02:46:44.800 --> 02:46:48.800]  Again, you have to judge the show off of the information I cover.
[02:46:48.800 --> 02:46:50.800]  Okay, I mean, do you think the globalists like what I'm doing?
[02:46:50.800 --> 02:46:52.800]  Do you think they like me up here exposing their system?
[02:46:52.800 --> 02:46:54.800]  No.
[02:46:54.800 --> 02:46:57.800]  All right, going to Luke Radowski, I wanted to get Luke to pop in.
[02:46:57.800 --> 02:47:02.800]  Founder of We Are Change, great journalist and activist in his own right
[02:47:02.800 --> 02:47:07.800]  to break down what the feeling was of the crowds there,
[02:47:07.800 --> 02:47:11.800]  the checkpoints all over the city and how it was used for a police state.
[02:47:11.800 --> 02:47:15.800]  10 years later, Luke, what's your view on 9-11
[02:47:15.800 --> 02:47:18.800]  and what you witnessed at this important memorial?
[02:47:18.800 --> 02:47:22.800]  I mean, this event, this anniversary was unlike any other.
[02:47:22.800 --> 02:47:26.800]  I mean, the police barricaded miles of New York City.
[02:47:26.800 --> 02:47:30.800]  It took at least an hour to get from one block to another.
[02:47:30.800 --> 02:47:35.800]  It was the most crazy thing since the Obama inauguration with National Guard
[02:47:35.800 --> 02:47:39.800]  on the street with M16 rifles, shotguns, full force.
[02:47:39.800 --> 02:47:42.800]  There were search and people. There were search and people's bags.
[02:47:42.800 --> 02:47:46.800]  The taming people for wearing on 9-11 was an inside job teacher
[02:47:46.800 --> 02:47:50.800]  and telling them they couldn't get near the memorial because they had a...
[02:47:50.800 --> 02:47:52.800]  9-11 was an inside job teacher.
[02:47:52.800 --> 02:47:56.800]  It was one of the most intense things, total lockdown of the city.
[02:47:56.800 --> 02:47:58.800]  Police were everywhere.
[02:47:58.800 --> 02:48:00.800]  You couldn't move around anywhere.
[02:48:00.800 --> 02:48:04.800]  And it was really just insane seeing the full force out there.
[02:48:04.800 --> 02:48:06.800]  Luke, let me stop you. This is big breaking news.
[02:48:06.800 --> 02:48:09.800]  And I'm going to cover it tonight then on television.
[02:48:09.800 --> 02:48:13.800]  And we're going to get an article out because you are a reporter and respected.
[02:48:13.800 --> 02:48:17.800]  How fast can you get footage or is there footage of the police saying
[02:48:17.800 --> 02:48:23.800]  if you have a 9-11 truth shirt, you weren't even allowed anywhere near on public streets?
[02:48:23.800 --> 02:48:25.800]  That is huge discrimination.
[02:48:25.800 --> 02:48:30.800]  Yes, I believe there's a video in the process of being uploaded right now
[02:48:30.800 --> 02:48:33.800]  by another non-alarm activist that was there.
[02:48:33.800 --> 02:48:36.800]  That was actually detained by them. It should be uploaded very soon.
[02:48:36.800 --> 02:48:37.800]  If I have the link, I'll send it to you.
[02:48:37.800 --> 02:48:40.800]  Yeah, more and more. That was the talking point we cover in Truth Rising
[02:48:40.800 --> 02:48:45.800]  is Fox, CNN, MSNBC. They say 9-11 truth works with al-Qaeda.
[02:48:45.800 --> 02:48:48.800]  It's not just that we're exposing the government. Did it?
[02:48:48.800 --> 02:48:51.800]  We're really terrorist. And of course we have the police saying
[02:48:51.800 --> 02:48:54.800]  your camera's a gun and a bomb and that they're going to frame you.
[02:48:54.800 --> 02:48:58.800]  That's in Truth Rising. So this is a standard M.O. now.
[02:48:58.800 --> 02:49:00.800]  Tell me more, Luke.
[02:49:00.800 --> 02:49:03.800]  And they even arrested a man for speaking out against 9-11 truth.
[02:49:03.800 --> 02:49:06.800]  He was, of course, raising his voice immediately at top.
[02:49:06.800 --> 02:49:10.800]  Come on and detain him and arrest him for just simply speaking out.
[02:49:10.800 --> 02:49:13.800]  Well, so now it's like North Korea.
[02:49:13.800 --> 02:49:17.800]  Now not only are there checkpoints of people being searched in military with guns,
[02:49:17.800 --> 02:49:22.800]  but now they arrest you. Wow, wow. Land of the free, huh?
[02:49:22.800 --> 02:49:25.800]  It was very intense. People were all over the place.
[02:49:25.800 --> 02:49:28.800]  I actually got a lot of great interviews with family members
[02:49:28.800 --> 02:49:32.800]  who were supporting new investigations, who didn't want to be used by the administration
[02:49:32.800 --> 02:49:36.800]  to prop off their propaganda. So I've been just working on a lot of videos this week
[02:49:36.800 --> 02:49:39.800]  and you're going to be seeing them on YouTube.com forward slash We Are Changed.
[02:49:39.800 --> 02:49:41.800]  I'm going to release a new video every morning.
[02:49:41.800 --> 02:49:43.800]  And it was just one of the surrealists.
[02:49:43.800 --> 02:49:45.800]  You couldn't get anywhere near the memorial.
[02:49:45.800 --> 02:49:49.800]  Usually at any other event, you had a press identification card.
[02:49:49.800 --> 02:49:52.800]  They would write into the memorial and be there with everything.
[02:49:52.800 --> 02:49:58.800]  But it was just the most complete control lockdown that I ever seen in New York City.
[02:49:58.800 --> 02:50:03.800]  And it was surreal seeing the people just scattered all over the place.
[02:50:03.800 --> 02:50:06.800]  And it definitely wasn't well put together at all.
[02:50:06.800 --> 02:50:08.800]  Well, they're definitely upset.
[02:50:08.800 --> 02:50:14.800]  I've talked to a lot of insiders that 9-11 Truth continues to surround the Ground Zero area.
[02:50:14.800 --> 02:50:19.800]  You're saying this time they had checkpoints blocks and blocks away
[02:50:19.800 --> 02:50:23.800]  and that you couldn't even get into the general area where the hotels are.
[02:50:23.800 --> 02:50:26.800]  Anything if you had a 9-11 Truth shirt. Wow.
[02:50:26.800 --> 02:50:28.800]  That is Soviet.
[02:50:28.800 --> 02:50:32.800]  Yeah, they had a couple of streets that were able that anybody was able to walk by.
[02:50:32.800 --> 02:50:35.800]  But if you wanted to get near the memorial, near the viewing station,
[02:50:35.800 --> 02:50:38.800]  you have to get to a police checkpoint where there were 1,000 people
[02:50:38.800 --> 02:50:42.800]  investigating not 11 teachers and investigating not 11 teachers.
[02:50:42.800 --> 02:50:47.800]  And they pretty much just ended people near the memorial with heritage,
[02:50:47.800 --> 02:50:49.800]  with faith everywhere.
[02:50:49.800 --> 02:50:51.800]  And they just locked it all down.
[02:50:51.800 --> 02:50:53.800]  Luke, stay there. Incredible.
[02:50:53.800 --> 02:50:58.800]  And this is only one more step away from, take them away, arresting them.
[02:50:58.800 --> 02:51:00.800]  Well, I guess they already did arrest a guy.
[02:51:00.800 --> 02:51:04.800]  What nutrition are you missing that's leading to the four major diseases?
[02:51:04.800 --> 02:51:07.800]  Cancer, arthritis, heart disease and Parkinson's.
[02:51:07.800 --> 02:51:12.800]  There are at least 80,000 medical studies that show a lack of the protein glutathione to be linked to cancer,
[02:51:12.800 --> 02:51:16.800]  heart disease, Parkinson's, macular degeneration, lung disease,
[02:51:16.800 --> 02:51:23.800]  digestive diseases, diabetes, Alzheimer's, ALS, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.
[02:51:23.800 --> 02:51:25.800]  In all, at least 68 diseases.
[02:51:25.800 --> 02:51:30.800]  What is the number one food by which your body is most empowered to increase its glutathione production?
[02:51:30.800 --> 02:51:33.800]  It is undamaged whey protein from grass-fed cows.
[02:51:33.800 --> 02:51:38.800]  One World Whey is truly the first undamaged whey protein powder on the market.
[02:51:38.800 --> 02:51:42.800]  All other whey proteins are damaged by heat, chemicals and filtration.

[02:52:14.800 --> 02:52:20.800]  No one can deny that our media operation is the tip of the spear and it's because of our success
[02:52:20.800 --> 02:52:27.800]  that we have a responsibility to intensify our operations against the globalist 110%.
[02:52:27.800 --> 02:52:31.800]  We're only a month away from launching a weeknight news broadcast.
[02:52:31.800 --> 02:52:33.800]  The social network is nearing completion as well.

[02:54:25.800 --> 02:54:34.800]  Hey, it's a free for all. I hope Glenn Beck doesn't continue his globalist ways, but he clearly is copying much of what we do.
[02:54:34.800 --> 02:54:45.800]  And they said that's one of the most sincere forms of flattery, so fine. He launches his show today. Well, ours has been launched for years, but we've launched the Nightly News in the last few weeks at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:54:45.800 --> 02:54:53.800]  And we're going to add a lot more in the future. So please become a member and support the true alternative media at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:54:53.800 --> 02:55:03.800]  And please spread the word about Infowars Nightly News. And those of you that are members, underwrite the development of a much more prolific and powerful system.
[02:55:03.800 --> 02:55:14.800]  Look, I know talking to some of the first responders, firefighters, police and others who were barred from the event because they're angry about the dust and the rest of it.
[02:55:14.800 --> 02:55:20.800]  In all fairness, I did see CBS News actually doing a report about it this weekend admitting that there was a cover-up.
[02:55:20.800 --> 02:55:29.800]  They were saying that they were going to try to go through the lines and protest up at the gates. Did you get any intel on what happened with that?
[02:55:29.800 --> 02:55:37.800]  Any form of protesting or any form of activism was virtually impossible down in New York City on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[02:55:37.800 --> 02:55:45.800]  It was impossible to walk anywhere. There was crowds everywhere, corralled in cages. You couldn't go from one place to another without waiting 20 minutes.
[02:55:45.800 --> 02:55:51.800]  All the streets were blocked off. Everything was the tightest security again that I ever saw in my life.
[02:55:51.800 --> 02:55:59.800]  I didn't see actual first responders walking around in the crowd. That's all I was able to see. But I was not able to see any first responders do any of that.
[02:55:59.800 --> 02:56:08.800]  And it was just a very chaotic, just all over the place. But I met many loving and caring people that came all over Europe, even as far as Australia, just to be there.
[02:56:08.800 --> 02:56:16.800]  I was just standing in solidarity with the first responders with the family members who were demanding a new investigation. It's not letting.
[02:56:16.800 --> 02:56:27.800]  Well, the good news is, Luke, I know you travel the world and it talks to a lot of people. But from my perspective as a media person, the general public isn't known.
[02:56:27.800 --> 02:56:38.800]  So they don't know how many people are awake. But when you are a prominent media person and you walk down the street and every other person comes up and says 9-11 is an inside job, you know we're winning this fight.
[02:56:38.800 --> 02:56:51.800]  And so there's this hoax the media is running that 9-11 truth is dead. I think instead of dead, it's just seen as common sense now and has become the pervasive fact.
[02:56:51.800 --> 02:57:02.800]  But it has lost some of its push to ever bring the perpetrators to justice because there's now 10 years on. So do you see the paradox I'm talking about?
[02:57:02.800 --> 02:57:08.800]  Yeah, there's definitely setting an illusion, making us feel isolated that we're alone, that nobody feels the way we do.
[02:57:08.800 --> 02:57:18.800]  But just being on the streets in New York City, even just walking by or doing interviews with random people, I find that the majority of people, especially when it comes to 9-11, know that there's something wrong.
[02:57:18.800 --> 02:57:24.800]  All they have to do is look at just a couple of buildings because they're been collapsing. And sadly, the nation media has not been doing that now.
[02:57:24.800 --> 02:57:32.800]  They haven't called us friends, they haven't called us crazy, but there's nothing crazy about asking questions and demanding answers and not doing what they do.
[02:57:32.800 --> 02:57:43.800]  They haven't helped any of our politicians accountable and that's why we're here. That's why we're asking people like Thomas Keen real legitimate questions and you see him running, ducking and diving away from a simple question.
[02:57:43.800 --> 02:57:57.800]  And that's all we're trying to show here is the information is being denied to us and they're not showing us what's really happening and I hope people slowly start waking up and they are and understanding that what we see on TV is not the reality, it's not the truth.
[02:57:57.800 --> 02:58:12.800]  It's only what corporate masters, corporate puppets want us to believe, want us to think. But as soon as we let that go, we start bringing ourselves and that's when a real evolution will take place where we will be able to actually take back this country and actually inspire people to actually do something.
[02:58:12.800 --> 02:58:19.800]  And I'm not giving up, I talked to Richard Gates last night and we had a long conversation and we told each other, I'm not giving up any time.
[02:58:19.800 --> 02:58:30.800]  Well, Luke, you're doing a superlative job. The main radio show is now over, but we'll be PrisonPlanet.TV and InfoWars audio stream for a little while longer because I promised to get to Freddie, CJ and Steve at least.
[02:58:30.800 --> 02:58:42.800]  But Luke, I want to say bye to you during the break here as we end the official radio show. I'll be back tonight, 7 o'clock Central, 8 o'clock Eastern, PrisonPlanet.TV. Be there.
[02:58:42.800 --> 02:58:51.800]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[02:58:51.800 --> 02:58:59.800]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:58:59.800 --> 02:59:04.800]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:59:04.800 --> 02:59:10.800]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots.
[02:59:10.800 --> 02:59:15.800]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:59:15.800 --> 02:59:25.800]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:59:25.800 --> 02:59:31.800]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:59:31.800 --> 02:59:39.800]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:59:39.800 --> 02:59:51.800]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com. We're watching online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:59:51.800 --> 02:59:58.800]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[02:59:58.800 --> 03:00:00.800]  Network.
[03:00:09.800 --> 03:00:16.800]  Live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:16.800 --> 03:00:21.800]  Okay, let's blast through three calls quickly. I appreciate you holding.
[03:00:21.800 --> 03:00:25.800]  Freddie in New Jersey, you're a trooper. Welcome to the airwaves.
[03:00:25.800 --> 03:00:28.800]  Hey Alex. Hey.
[03:00:28.800 --> 03:00:34.800]  I just wanted to add, history books do lie. We're never caught the real history of this country.
[03:00:34.800 --> 03:00:39.800]  We get books loaded with cover stories. Criminal elements do run our country.
[03:00:39.800 --> 03:00:47.800]  We saw this with the JFK assassination, by the way, which I think, Freddie proved that it was a conspiracy.
[03:00:47.800 --> 03:00:52.800]  People don't study, you know, why he got killed because that's the real question.
[03:00:52.800 --> 03:00:59.800]  Well, by history books, you've got to read a whole bunch of them and then study human nature and then you start to get a grasp.
[03:00:59.800 --> 03:01:02.800]  But you're right. You don't get the truth just reading one history book.
[03:01:02.800 --> 03:01:08.800]  Or if you see history book being promoted by the nightly news, you better believe it's full of a bunch of bull.
[03:01:08.800 --> 03:01:16.800]  And I think that when he died, you know, part of this country died because it's changed for the worse ever since he died.
[03:01:16.800 --> 03:01:24.800]  Well, yeah, I mean, Kennedy wasn't perfect, but you got a real CIA banker Wall Street coup at that point before they were pretty much running the show.
[03:01:24.800 --> 03:01:33.800]  But at that point, they were top dogs and they set up a property tax, everything else to shut down the middle class and transfer everything to themselves.
[03:01:33.800 --> 03:01:38.800]  Great points, Freddie. Let's talk to Steve in New York. Welcome, Steve.
[03:01:38.800 --> 03:01:42.800]  Thank you, Alex. It's been a while, actually. I've listened to you for a number of years.
[03:01:42.800 --> 03:01:46.800]  You even talked me into getting active back in the New York camera band thing.
[03:01:46.800 --> 03:01:50.800]  And that's what I met Luke and all the We Are Changed guys.
[03:01:50.800 --> 03:01:54.800]  So great hearing him again. It's been a while, actually.
[03:01:54.800 --> 03:01:57.800]  But yeah, just a couple of things.
[03:01:57.800 --> 03:02:04.800]  Yeah, New York this weekend, you couldn't even get into the city. Even Friday night, you know, I thought I could sneak in Friday night to do some stuff.
[03:02:04.800 --> 03:02:07.800]  And you got a two hour backup in every direction.
[03:02:07.800 --> 03:02:11.800]  All the cars would carry down the one lane. You had to kind of run the gauntlet.
[03:02:11.800 --> 03:02:15.800]  Yeah, no, that's done on purpose to shut down human mobility.
[03:02:15.800 --> 03:02:20.800]  They use all these as beta test drills on how to shut down and control society.
[03:02:20.800 --> 03:02:28.800]  And they've got, like, these little tickers that go behind the cars now, like, see something, say something, then whatever else they want to have put up there.
[03:02:28.800 --> 03:02:36.800]  No, no. New York is a beta test for how all the rest of the world is going to operate, just a hellish third world police state.
[03:02:36.800 --> 03:02:46.800]  Also, you were mentioning before on the building 7, it made me, because I was downtown doing 9-11, and I was actually filming around 4 or 5 o'clock.
[03:02:46.800 --> 03:02:56.800]  And same thing, the cops to say, okay, that the cop I talked to said the FedEx building was coming down because it had been damaged and, you know, it was unsafe.
[03:02:56.800 --> 03:02:59.800]  Now it's like across the street, so I could see his mistake.
[03:02:59.800 --> 03:03:02.800]  But yeah, they kept, like, shelling all this up the canal street.
[03:03:02.800 --> 03:03:07.800]  And the time they got up the canal street, that's when you felt the rumble and everything.
[03:03:07.800 --> 03:03:09.800]  But yeah, they definitely...
[03:03:09.800 --> 03:03:14.800]  Well, that's another thing. You can hear, right before 7 falls, they blow the core columns, you hear...
[03:03:14.800 --> 03:03:22.800]  And then there goes the penthouse with the centrals, then the...
[03:03:22.800 --> 03:03:27.800]  Inside, I mean, it's a perfect demolition, and you ought to see the information.
[03:03:27.800 --> 03:03:29.800]  I've got to carry the DVD, it's not out yet.
[03:03:29.800 --> 03:03:42.800]  But Richard Gage has this expert speak, and it's like all these top guys who've built giant skyscrapers, you know, famous architects saying, yes, this is a controlled demolition.
[03:03:42.800 --> 03:03:44.800]  They don't need to be a famous architect to know that.
[03:03:44.800 --> 03:03:50.800]  I saw them do it, and I talked to the cops that were there and heard the 10-second countdown.
[03:03:50.800 --> 03:03:54.800]  They blew the stinking thing up. It's an inside job.
[03:03:54.800 --> 03:03:58.800]  Yeah, I didn't hear a countdown, but everybody's walkie-talkies would chatter me.
[03:03:58.800 --> 03:04:04.800]  You could tell, suddenly there was this buzz of activity, and it was like, okay, there it goes.
[03:04:04.800 --> 03:04:07.800]  Well, there you were, Steve. I can't tell you how many EMTs and cops.
[03:04:07.800 --> 03:04:12.800]  I've talked to cops that were in the CNN shot with the cops saying, get back.
[03:04:12.800 --> 03:04:19.800]  I've talked to the cop that was there with Amy Goodman, and you see her start running, and then it boom, boom, boom falls, because there was a countdown.
[03:04:19.800 --> 03:04:22.800]  And people say, oh, are you saying cops did it? No.
[03:04:22.800 --> 03:04:28.800]  The cops are told it's coming down because of fires. They've got to bring it down, and the cops aren't demolition experts, and all this.
[03:04:28.800 --> 03:04:32.800]  They're like, actually, some cops I talked to that day were like, you're going to bring it down?
[03:04:32.800 --> 03:04:37.800]  Didn't it take time to do that? They're like, don't worry about it, officer. Get out of here. They're bringing it down.
[03:04:37.800 --> 03:04:44.800]  And then it's like, all right, countdown. 10 seconds. Get out of here.
[03:04:44.800 --> 03:04:50.800]  All right, I appreciate your call. God bless you. I'm sorry to CJ in Michigan.
[03:04:50.800 --> 03:04:53.800]  You call me back tomorrow. You go to the head of the line, CJ.
[03:04:53.800 --> 03:04:57.800]  All right, I'll see you tonight. 7 o'clock. We're risking our lives, our treasure, everything.
