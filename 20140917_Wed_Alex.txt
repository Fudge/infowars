[00:00.000 --> 00:12.600]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.600 --> 00:38.880]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:38.880 --> 00:45.600]  John McAfee is going to be joining us of course of McAfee antivirus software to
[00:45.600 --> 00:49.760]  break down exactly what's happening with the so-called security of the cloud
[00:49.760 --> 00:56.160]  and to detail exactly why the police and FBI lie about the mystery cell terror
[00:56.160 --> 01:00.160]  hours around the country that really aren't mysteries at all that's in the
[01:00.160 --> 01:03.600]  third hour for the first two hours we're gonna open the phones up and cover the
[01:03.600 --> 01:10.440]  waterfront almost live Wednesday the 17th of September 2014 worldwide broadcast
[01:10.440 --> 01:17.560]  I am your host Alex Jones obviously the Ebola situation in Obama's words is
[01:17.560 --> 01:22.440]  spiraling out of control and as a serious threat and they've committed
[01:22.440 --> 01:27.440]  3,000 troops as of yesterday to go into these five African now six African
[01:27.440 --> 01:30.400]  nations but they're gonna be in five countries two particularly that are
[01:30.400 --> 01:36.360]  ravaged and where the governments are close to collapsing and society is
[01:36.360 --> 01:44.960]  close to spiraling into anarchy and a total of 6,000 other UN troops are gonna
[01:44.960 --> 01:50.800]  be sent who are not trained and properly equipped to be around Ebola in a hot
[01:50.800 --> 01:55.680]  zone you can argue they go in and quote contain it that means shooting people
[01:55.680 --> 02:00.840]  that try to exit areas across borders and putting them in the giant ghettos to
[02:00.840 --> 02:08.200]  basically die that's on record what they're doing or is it really just gonna
[02:08.200 --> 02:12.560]  be putting troops into a hot zone where they can gestate this for 22 days and
[02:12.560 --> 02:17.360]  bring it back into the United States and undoubtedly there's some typhoid
[02:17.360 --> 02:22.880]  Marys in there who have got Ebola or will get Ebola who are master carriers who
[02:22.880 --> 02:30.880]  carry it a lot longer than 22 days so we're gonna be breaking it all down here
[02:30.880 --> 02:36.920]  today want to just say the crew and Rob do and everybody did a fabulous job
[02:36.920 --> 02:43.840]  yesterday I had a stomach ache in the morning and in the old days I would just
[02:43.840 --> 02:49.120]  come in if I had a stomach ache or something but I just decided to take
[02:49.120 --> 02:53.560]  off and get some rest so I did do that but ended up working in the afternoon
[02:53.560 --> 02:58.160]  but it's just wonderful to be able to have an arsenal of great minds here to
[02:58.160 --> 03:01.760]  help fill in when I can't do the broadcast like Paul Watson Rob do and
[03:01.760 --> 03:06.920]  the rest of the reporters just amazing we have such an informed team like our
[03:06.920 --> 03:11.480]  news director on the TV side Rob do who could just step in here never doing a
[03:11.480 --> 03:16.240]  radio show in his life other than filling in some here as a guest and host
[03:16.240 --> 03:21.120]  the radio show that's in the top 10 talk shows political talk shows in the
[03:21.120 --> 03:26.560]  country and in the top five political websites now you can look that up for
[03:26.560 --> 03:32.400]  yourself so pretty pretty powerful arsenal of researchers and political minds
[03:32.400 --> 03:36.120]  that we now have here we're finally getting a little bit of depth in our
[03:36.120 --> 03:41.680]  operation something that we desperately needs we can expand with our reporters
[03:41.680 --> 03:45.840]  and our research our analysis and cover more in depth of what's happening
[03:45.840 --> 03:51.680]  here on our planet so great job of the crew dozens of children feared dead after
[03:51.680 --> 03:58.480]  being injected with tainted measles vaccine in Syria by the UN and who
[03:58.480 --> 04:03.280]  carried it out the loving rebels when they're not nerve-gassing children or
[04:03.280 --> 04:06.960]  topping their heads off there they're vaccinating them it doesn't matter that
[04:06.960 --> 04:10.520]  it's on record that the rebels are the ones doing it they're trying to blame
[04:10.520 --> 04:16.640]  Assad who I'm not saying is a cupcake of goodness but quite frankly I can't find
[04:16.640 --> 04:23.000]  a lot he's done to say that's bad other than being a dictator kind of a
[04:23.000 --> 04:33.360]  below semi-benevolent not malevolent the pare-dal kind of that is certainly he
[04:33.360 --> 04:36.240]  was trying to democratize and they used that as a way to get in there and
[04:36.240 --> 04:39.920]  overthrow much of the nation but Kurt Neymar wrote a detailed article about
[04:39.920 --> 04:50.240]  it showing how it's a lot more than 36 children and it's excruciating how they
[04:50.240 --> 04:54.720]  died we're gonna get into the latest on just a host of issues straight ahead

[09:47.720 --> 09:54.600]  after u.n. gives tainted vaccine in rebel held syria u.s. and shoddy back to
[09:54.600 --> 10:02.040]  mercenaries blame Assad fantastically curtain ammo wrote that story and the
[10:02.040 --> 10:08.280]  story links to the London Telegraph and to the world health organization
[10:08.280 --> 10:12.680]  dozens of children feared dead after being injected with tainted measles
[10:12.680 --> 10:19.080]  vaccine syria we're going to go over the horrible deaths writhing in pain right
[10:19.080 --> 10:27.520]  after getting the vaccines that resembled what cyanide does and what's
[10:27.520 --> 10:34.200]  amazing is it's admitted to be a u.n. program it's admitted to be in rebel
[10:34.200 --> 10:41.280]  held areas but then the rebels blame Assad how like there's video of them
[10:41.280 --> 10:50.360]  going hello last year 15 months ago and launching chemical attacks on multiple
[10:50.360 --> 10:57.080]  sites inside syria waving al-qaeda flags and then our news media would say oh
[10:57.080 --> 11:01.440]  Assad did it and then even the u.n. tested the chemicals and said no it's
[11:01.440 --> 11:09.360]  Saudi Arabian I mean it's pretty obvious when Obama goes two years ago if we
[11:09.360 --> 11:15.200]  see anyone launch chemical weapons rebels or Assad we're gonna bomb Assad
[11:15.200 --> 11:19.400]  and blame him that's our red line effect it was on the anniversary so it's two
[11:19.400 --> 11:23.840]  and a half years ago the anniversary of Obama's red line statement and speech
[11:23.840 --> 11:29.360]  that the rebels launched the chemical attack the first one of three remember
[11:29.360 --> 11:39.200]  all this early part of 2013 and then Obama came out in March
[11:39.200 --> 11:45.280]  a year later and said the red line has been crossed the globalists are such
[11:45.280 --> 11:48.880]  gangsters it's so obvious if any chemical weapons get used we're gonna
[11:48.880 --> 11:54.520]  blame Assad a year later al-qaeda launches the attack against Assad and
[11:54.520 --> 12:01.280]  against the army and then blames them and then now in the London telegraph in
[12:01.280 --> 12:06.360]  der spiegel in the World Health Organization's own statement it's a u.n.
[12:06.360 --> 12:16.360]  program in the north in an area seized by the quote good rebels I am not a bad
[12:16.360 --> 12:22.360]  witch I am a glinda the good witch to quote the lollipop guild speech in the
[12:22.360 --> 12:28.360]  Wizard of Oz it's like we're going to arm the rebels to fight the rebels it's
[12:28.360 --> 12:33.280]  all oxymorons it's all up is down down is up black is white two plus two equals
[12:33.280 --> 12:37.200]  whatever they say it is just so crazy but then there's the whole discussion of
[12:37.200 --> 12:43.120]  why in Pakistan why in Libya why all over Africa to the 50 years ago the
[12:43.120 --> 12:48.640]  natives would beg for the white medicine man's medicine now they run because
[12:48.640 --> 12:52.000]  they give them shots in the whole village gets HIV or they give them shots
[12:52.000 --> 12:55.320]  in the whole village is sterilized or they give them the polio vaccine and
[12:55.320 --> 12:59.560]  half the kids in the town become paralyzed and a bunch of them die I mean I
[12:59.560 --> 13:04.080]  see this in the press all the time and it's almost like it's a conditioning or
[13:04.080 --> 13:09.400]  a psychological inoculation titrating the poison of tyranny where now I see
[13:09.400 --> 13:14.880]  articles about a vaccinating people and some and them dying and it's not even a
[13:14.880 --> 13:19.680]  news issue anymore
[13:22.080 --> 13:27.880]  I am being conditioned to accept it oh I saw a local newscast an 11 year old
[13:27.880 --> 13:31.080]  girl a cheerleader it's always a cheerleader for some reason took the
[13:31.080 --> 13:34.960]  shot so because mommy didn't want to ever get cancer again even though it
[13:34.960 --> 13:39.400]  doesn't protect you from cancer even the papillomavirus it says on the insert
[13:39.400 --> 13:42.600]  oh there's thousands of strains this only covers four to eight or whatever it
[13:42.600 --> 13:46.360]  says there's different variants of it and it doesn't protect you and might give
[13:46.360 --> 13:51.000]  you a Guillain beret or your little bowel syndrome or autoimmune or might kill
[13:51.000 --> 13:58.240]  you and now I see those articles every few days where somebody new dies from it
[13:58.240 --> 14:02.440]  India Japan bandit years ago was introduced there eight years ago like
[14:02.440 --> 14:09.760]  here but not in America all over the world GMOs are being pulled off the
[14:09.760 --> 14:16.240]  shelves all over the world glyphosate is being banned or restricted look at this
[14:16.240 --> 14:22.680]  article Nestle removes GMO ingredients from baby foods in South Africa but not
[14:22.680 --> 14:32.120]  in the USA company actively ignores request of US consumers another great
[14:32.120 --> 14:37.960]  article by Christina Sarich for infowars.com from National Society
[14:37.960 --> 14:46.000]  you see we are the dumping ground for everything here's that the globe and
[14:46.000 --> 14:50.200]  mail US lawmakers want to curb antibiotic use on farms oh I thought it
[14:50.200 --> 14:53.080]  was a conspiracy theory that we were getting superbugs from feeding
[14:53.080 --> 14:56.720]  antibiotics before animals are even sick across the board so they can live in
[14:56.720 --> 15:01.320]  horrible conditions and then we eat the antibiotics and then it makes us fat and
[15:01.320 --> 15:05.520]  bloated and screws up our guts and destroys our immune system that's a
[15:05.520 --> 15:12.760]  fact and now it's mainstream news oh here's another one doctors and nurses
[15:12.760 --> 15:19.400]  you are the vaccine fraud tipping point do not be intimidated into staying
[15:19.400 --> 15:23.160]  silent by your hospital directors and managers and it's an excellent report
[15:23.160 --> 15:27.200]  video report detailing how that's the next level of rebellion just like in the
[15:27.200 --> 15:31.960]  army with the smallpox and anthrax shots they were the ones that ended up
[15:31.960 --> 15:35.920]  getting those shots stopped that were by the way illegal you can't make troops
[15:35.920 --> 15:40.000]  take experimental shots you can order them to take vaccines that are quote
[15:40.000 --> 15:45.000]  seen as approved for general use and not experimental the military is the
[15:45.000 --> 15:48.440]  only group you can make take vaccines because you sign those forms and wave
[15:48.440 --> 15:53.160]  your rights and I think that's wrong and should be changed but they have been
[15:53.160 --> 15:57.560]  caught giving troops experimental drugs experimental vaccines that kill them over
[15:57.560 --> 16:01.680]  and over again and it was the military doctors that rebelled time and time
[16:01.680 --> 16:08.440]  again and stopped it and now they want to test experimental Ebola vaccine on
[16:08.440 --> 16:15.720]  humans made from the chimpanzee virus sky news reports and guess who you know
[16:15.720 --> 16:20.760]  they're gonna be testing it on the troops and then when they get sick
[16:20.760 --> 16:27.240]  telling them just go in a hole and die so that's why I mentioned that up front
[16:27.240 --> 16:33.360]  today with all the news we've got it's really starting to come out how bad GMO
[16:33.360 --> 16:37.560]  is how bad glyphosate is how bad fluoride is and we're seeing more and more
[16:37.560 --> 16:41.880]  mainstream news forced to admit it because medical doctors and scientists
[16:41.880 --> 16:49.960]  are going public speaking of that CBS news today our cell phones really giving
[16:49.960 --> 16:58.560]  us cancer and it goes on to say doctors say keep cell phones on airplane mode
[16:58.560 --> 17:03.040]  while in pocket to lower cancer risk elementary school should children
[17:03.040 --> 17:08.640]  should not have more than three hours a week around wireless yes it is a
[17:08.640 --> 17:14.880]  microwave transmission system that for decades they've known increases cancers
[17:14.880 --> 17:19.360]  I've talked to medical doctors brain surgeons who say it is epidemic brain
[17:19.360 --> 17:22.560]  tumors on the side of the head where you use the cell phone and everyone I know
[17:22.560 --> 17:26.600]  and my friends and family I buy them hands-free I buy them because it's just
[17:26.600 --> 17:31.520]  like a radio connection basically I buy them wires that have been shown to at
[17:31.520 --> 17:35.360]  least not radiate right up against your head because for the length of the
[17:35.360 --> 17:44.000]  microwave antenna it lessens by half every movement out from its measurement
[17:44.000 --> 17:47.640]  so the cell phones three feet away from you it is literally hundreds of times
[17:47.640 --> 17:51.840]  weaker still not good for you and we're bathed in this background radiation but
[17:51.840 --> 17:56.160]  in all the major studies you can look them up we've covered them when you put
[17:56.160 --> 18:01.800]  a cell phone right up against tissue it vibrates the DNA chains till they break
[18:01.800 --> 18:07.640]  then they start mutating then you get cancer it ages you and for the life of
[18:07.640 --> 18:12.200]  me I cannot stop my father from walking around on the cell phone all day with it
[18:12.200 --> 18:16.000]  up against his head he will not use wires he will not use hands-free because
[18:16.000 --> 18:20.440]  it's a habit it's easy he's committed I know parents with their children just
[18:20.440 --> 18:26.160]  give them cell phones all day and people will divorce over it and say my kids are
[18:26.160 --> 18:28.840]  gonna have cell phones that's the end of it we're gonna have wireless you know
[18:28.840 --> 18:32.600]  we're gonna be bathed in this because you know it's invisible I don't see it
[18:32.600 --> 18:41.960]  you're making it up our cell phones really giving us cancer Chris Moore spoke

[22:07.080 --> 22:11.240]  toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations
[22:11.240 --> 22:15.280]  of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90% of their time
[22:15.280 --> 22:19.360]  inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there are more than 42

[22:23.440 --> 22:27.400]  mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the fact that six million
[22:27.400 --> 22:30.560]  Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well when I began to
[22:30.560 --> 22:34.600]  research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my
[22:34.600 --> 22:38.800]  lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but

[23:51.820 --> 24:16.600]  patreon supply.com remember before it's time to survive it's time to prepare
[24:16.600 --> 24:22.460]  there's close to 3,000 deaths now in Africa from Ebola many estimates many
[24:22.460 --> 24:28.260]  experts believe it's much higher they estimate 30,000 people have contracted
[24:28.260 --> 24:31.300]  it they believe it'll be over a hundred thousand the World Health Organization
[24:31.300 --> 24:35.500]  does by December perhaps higher many virologists looking at the viral
[24:35.500 --> 24:40.140]  spread maps are talking about five million people dying of course that was
[24:40.140 --> 24:44.620]  in build major German publication last week with one of the top virologist
[24:44.620 --> 24:50.660]  speaking in the country I don't know that's true I know that the policy has
[24:50.660 --> 24:55.060]  been don't bring Ebola patients to Western countries treat them on ships if
[24:55.060 --> 25:02.700]  they're US citizens or Western citizens now they're bringing Ebola patients to
[25:02.700 --> 25:07.620]  the United States and to basically every European country Spain Germany they're
[25:07.620 --> 25:11.940]  all taking them extremely dangerous situation in my view here's some of the
[25:11.940 --> 25:19.300]  headlines US to commit up to 30 3,000 troops to fight Ebola in Africa another
[25:19.300 --> 25:24.020]  article 6,000 UN peacekeepers not trained to fight Ebola are being deployed
[25:24.020 --> 25:28.500]  that's not a world that daily Ebola crisis could last for years have not
[25:28.500 --> 25:35.900]  controlled quickly is what testimony to Congress is basically saying but one of
[25:35.900 --> 25:39.860]  the doctors that survived Ebola was taken back to the US testified that's in
[25:39.860 --> 25:44.220]  a Wall Street Journal American doctor recalls horror of contracting Ebola
[25:44.220 --> 25:50.940]  Obama warns America can't dawdle on Ebola as he warns African epidemic could
[25:50.940 --> 25:56.940]  infect hundreds of thousands and jeopardize US national security well
[25:56.940 --> 26:02.940]  the panic and hysteria that it's already causing in Sierra Leone Liberia and
[26:02.940 --> 26:10.780]  other areas has threatened to bring those countries completely down and they're
[26:10.780 --> 26:14.540]  already locking up whole areas of cities and just throwing people in putting
[26:14.540 --> 26:19.100]  barbed wire up around like the Warsaw ghetto in World War two it's just really
[26:19.100 --> 26:24.060]  pitiful to see the video feeds that we've played here folks with Ebola starving
[26:24.060 --> 26:28.740]  trying to climb out and being stopped by the police and being drug off in
[26:28.740 --> 26:32.860]  containment vehicles to be thrown back in but what are you supposed to do once
[26:32.860 --> 26:36.860]  society starts to collapse and do you want those jobs of those police and
[26:36.860 --> 26:42.660]  those military and and of the hazmat teams that are one of the biggest groups
[26:42.660 --> 26:48.420]  contracting Ebola that's another issue people in full hazmat year are getting
[26:48.420 --> 26:56.180]  it now if you can't get it except by saliva or inhaling it then why is it
[26:56.180 --> 27:01.300]  spreading we know versions of Ebola have gone airborne before as evidence by
[27:01.300 --> 27:07.660]  declassified army documents front that were first disclosed on Nova in 1990
[27:07.660 --> 27:13.740]  we've played that clip here multiple times I'm tempted to play it again now
[27:13.740 --> 27:20.380]  continuing Obama warns America can't dawdle speaking from the CDC yesterday
[27:20.380 --> 27:25.500]  we have to act fast he warned we can't dawdle on this one as he brings Ebola
[27:25.500 --> 27:28.900]  patients back to the US I have no confidence in Obama and quite frankly
[27:28.900 --> 27:34.100]  this stinks of being a weaponized Ebola and the perfect global crisis and I've
[27:34.100 --> 27:38.220]  been predicting we'd see bio weapon releases in the last year because it
[27:38.220 --> 27:41.900]  just fits into this I mean they're giving al-Qaeda chemical weapons to launch
[27:41.900 --> 27:46.420]  attacks on Assad they turned Libya over to al-Qaeda three years ago and are now
[27:46.420 --> 27:50.020]  talking about US military having to go in there to stop them people say wow
[27:50.020 --> 27:55.900]  Obama screwed up arming al-Qaeda Libya is a failed state that was the plan to
[27:55.900 --> 28:01.260]  bring down Africa Libya was sustaining and industrializing the entire
[28:01.260 --> 28:06.100]  continent and and they wanted to create a African Union that would actually let
[28:06.100 --> 28:10.060]  Africa get its own resources and build its own infrastructure and that's a big
[28:10.060 --> 28:15.020]  no-no under UN agenda 21 and not just for Africa
[28:15.020 --> 28:18.940]  Obamacare is meant to shut down small business Obamacare is meant to shut
[28:18.940 --> 28:24.500]  down small companies all the clowered and pivot carbon taxes are meant to shut
[28:24.500 --> 28:28.100]  down our factories and jobs and you know what they're doing a great job with
[28:28.100 --> 28:34.340]  it so this fits into the overall global depopulation plan that they openly
[28:34.340 --> 28:38.020]  write about in all these globalist publications remember what Prince Philip
[28:38.020 --> 28:44.300]  said he told her spiegel and he also told the world while I fund general
[28:44.300 --> 28:52.220]  Congress he'd pull up his two quotes and in the forward to if I was an animal
[28:52.220 --> 28:59.020]  Prince Charles's book Prince Philip dead the forward and he said I would like to
[28:59.020 --> 29:04.380]  come back reincarnate as a deadly virus to wipe out the majority of humanity to
[29:04.380 --> 29:08.980]  contribute something in the culling of the herd now that's probably a perfect
[29:08.980 --> 29:12.500]  quote or I may have conflated the two quotes we can you can pull up Prince
[29:12.500 --> 29:17.620]  Phillips quote about being reincarnated as a virus okay that's all I'm saying you
[29:17.620 --> 29:22.820]  got Dr. Pionk at UT there it is want to be virus Prince Philip attacks big
[29:22.820 --> 29:28.060]  families there's an article right there the London Times you can click on that
[29:28.060 --> 29:34.980]  we'll get we'll get you the actual quote just amazing these people are the
[29:34.980 --> 29:38.380]  prime suspects Ebola poses a new challenge for US military Wall Street

[29:47.260 --> 29:50.460]  borders up to stop Ebola I'm not kidding we're on the mark coming up the
[29:50.460 --> 29:55.540]  empires that's Dick Durbin Alex the top Democrat on the Amazon radio network
[29:55.540 --> 30:02.420]  can't make this stuff up from the water table to our soils to the atmosphere
[30:02.420 --> 30:06.980]  itself our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day but it's
[30:06.980 --> 30:10.820]  not just the air outside that's toxic indoor air has been shown to have two
[30:10.820 --> 30:14.340]  to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and

[30:22.980 --> 30:26.900]  over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions and
[30:26.900 --> 30:30.060]  don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're
[30:30.060 --> 30:33.580]  allergic to as well when I began to research these statistics it was clear
[30:33.580 --> 30:38.260]  to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic

[33:22.300 --> 33:36.300]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[33:36.300 --> 33:42.380]  show about two months ago drug report dot com and info wars dot com and world
[33:42.380 --> 33:47.100]  that daily dot com and others began to quote top virologist and others and in
[33:47.100 --> 33:54.180]  link to stories that said that aircraft flying into the united states from
[33:54.180 --> 34:00.780]  western africa and central africa posed a major threat of bringing Ebola into
[34:00.780 --> 34:05.820]  the united states now it doesn't take rocket science to know that people can
[34:05.820 --> 34:10.980]  carry it for 22 days now it's spreading very quickly it's killing 90 plus
[34:10.980 --> 34:15.180]  percent of people that end up getting it 50 percent of you get western medical
[34:15.180 --> 34:22.380]  treatment right away 55% or so and that a lot of these people are also flying in
[34:22.380 --> 34:27.900]  from the middle east and africa and that cases of people with Ebola were
[34:27.900 --> 34:32.300]  showing up in Saudi arabia and other areas that there was a good chance that
[34:32.300 --> 34:36.580]  the thousands of other than mexicans that's what it's called in the board
[34:36.580 --> 34:42.980]  patrol filings being caught every month at different border sectors in texas
[34:42.980 --> 34:49.580]  arizona mexico california that there's a good chance of bola would also pass the
[34:49.580 --> 35:00.220]  border and herald a Rivera came out and attacked a bunch of people who's been on
[35:00.220 --> 35:04.580]  the show i like a lot of what herald does over the years he exposed government
[35:04.580 --> 35:07.980]  drug dealing you name it but he basically came out and said it's racist
[35:07.980 --> 35:11.500]  against his panics if you don't want total open borders and there's no Ebola
[35:11.500 --> 35:17.780]  threat is what he said he said it was fear mongering and then taking his cue as
[35:17.780 --> 35:22.420]  I mentioned earlier in the week all over international media the associated
[35:22.420 --> 35:28.260]  press cbs news not just info wars dot com or drudge report dot com but paul
[35:28.260 --> 35:41.420]  Watson and Kurt Nemo and myself all got singled out we all got singled out that
[35:41.420 --> 35:45.020]  we were fear mongering about that Ebola could be going airborne and that it could
[35:45.020 --> 35:48.380]  come across the border or flying on an airplane well now the president says
[35:48.380 --> 35:53.420]  that it's a major crisis spiraling out of control I have the quotes I read them
[35:53.420 --> 36:00.220]  last segment I'll read you the headline again with the close quote AFP Ebola
[36:00.220 --> 36:04.540]  spiraling Ebola crisis spiraling out of control close quote warrants president
[36:04.540 --> 36:11.900]  Obama okay so I just want to state again that being right first is not a bad
[36:11.900 --> 36:18.820]  thing knowing what you're talking about is not evil and obviously having a wide
[36:18.820 --> 36:25.740]  open border when you've got already drug resistant to tuberculosis and drug
[36:25.740 --> 36:31.220]  immune tuberculosis and all these other diseases pouring across the southern
[36:31.220 --> 36:37.660]  border there's a reason people don't go to South America or Central America
[36:37.660 --> 36:42.780]  unless you go to the nicer areas of Chile it's because you got to take a
[36:42.780 --> 36:46.340]  bunch of shots and a bunch of medicine and you still get sick a lot when you go
[36:46.340 --> 36:53.140]  down there I mean they got stuff that'll curl your hair and we have no known
[36:53.140 --> 36:56.540]  immunity do it up here people are pretty tough down there they've been living
[36:56.540 --> 37:02.980]  around it for thousands of years the mezzo-americans but this issue of hey
[37:02.980 --> 37:08.180]  we might not want to just merge with the third world they now even let people
[37:08.180 --> 37:13.580]  under the US that have a leprosy wet as it's called transferable communicable
[37:13.580 --> 37:19.900]  leprosy but there's all these forced vaccines and checkpoints and surveillance
[37:19.900 --> 37:25.700]  and homeland security rating swap meets where people are selling knockoff NFL
[37:25.700 --> 37:31.500]  coasters and SWAT team raids of a guy that has a 23 year old Range Rover that
[37:31.500 --> 37:41.900]  they don't think has proper emission controls on it that's all going on with
[37:41.900 --> 37:47.980]  the backdrop of war with Russia war in the Middle East dollar devaluation
[37:47.980 --> 37:54.380]  Ebola spreading China threatening to invade the Philippines again just just
[37:54.380 --> 37:58.460]  the whole world's blowing up and it's being activated by the globalists at the
[37:58.460 --> 38:03.380]  top to play all our countries off against each other it's a global
[38:03.380 --> 38:08.500]  destabilization program and then meanwhile Dick Durbin says amnesty bill
[38:08.500 --> 38:14.500]  will help contain Ebola it makes it even easier for illegals to come here it
[38:14.500 --> 38:18.180]  gives amnesty to basically anybody who can get here even if you're a felon you
[38:18.180 --> 38:21.700]  promise not to be a felon again it's the same bill the Republicans wrote up with
[38:21.700 --> 38:25.980]  the Democrats four times under Bush because the elite want a North American
[38:25.980 --> 38:32.460]  Union because then that new system that new bureaucracy can circumvent all the
[38:32.460 --> 38:37.100]  other state laws and federal it's not even a federal government we're dealing
[38:37.100 --> 38:43.420]  with it's a captured system by the offshore corporations who were exempt
[38:43.420 --> 38:48.300]  from the taxes that's back in the news today yesterday senator dick Durbin of
[38:48.300 --> 38:53.980]  Illinois said that a comprehensive amnesty bill would help Americans
[38:53.980 --> 38:58.900]  contain the Ebola epidemic when it simply opens the border up even more that is so
[38:58.900 --> 39:06.300]  ridiculous here's one out of Reuters citing security threat Obama expands
[39:06.300 --> 39:10.420]  U.S. role fighting Ebola again but does nothing with the border that he ordered
[39:10.420 --> 39:15.900]  basically completely opened back in January of this year he doesn't have
[39:15.900 --> 39:20.500]  to act executively he already has acted so they have the newscasters saying
[39:20.500 --> 39:23.980]  Obama's getting in trouble with the open borders lobby because he didn't open the
[39:23.980 --> 39:30.580]  borders he has opened the borders for all intents and purposes now to make it
[39:30.580 --> 39:37.620]  even more rich DHS official claims border more secure than ever but truth is
[39:37.620 --> 39:42.180]  opposite of what Obama administration suggests in true Orwellian fashion the
[39:42.180 --> 39:45.860]  deputy secretary of Homeland Security claimed the border is more secure than
[39:45.860 --> 39:50.300]  ever has been before speaking to a liberal think tank yesterday deputy
[39:50.300 --> 39:57.780]  security secretary Al Gerondo maker costs I'm having trouble pronouncing that
[39:57.780 --> 40:02.340]  suggested a dip in apprehensions of illegal immigrants youth last month
[40:02.340 --> 40:05.700]  because they just ordered him to let him go meant the Obama administration has
[40:05.700 --> 40:09.340]  greatly strengthened border security a fantasy considering that anyone including
[40:09.340 --> 40:14.900]  ISIS would have no problem walking to America what we have achieved is
[40:14.900 --> 40:20.260]  tremendous progress he claimed I mean this is all a sickening sickening joke
[40:20.260 --> 40:24.860]  and again I want to explain yes the war on terror is a hoax because it's aimed
[40:24.860 --> 40:32.740]  at gun owners returning veterans vets libertarians Christians pro-lifers our
[40:32.740 --> 40:37.820]  government the illegitimate part of it is arming ISIS and the borders wide open
[40:37.820 --> 40:41.620]  so when they tell you hey you live in a post 9-11 world we've got a spy on
[40:41.620 --> 40:46.660]  everything you do track everything you do increase the numbers of federalized
[40:46.660 --> 40:53.140]  police they created the crisis they ship in the drugs and then have asset
[40:53.140 --> 40:56.660]  for which are seizure taking cash out of your wallet when no drugs are found
[40:56.660 --> 41:02.780]  well because it's a war on drugs they introduced the crises to re-engineer
[41:02.780 --> 41:07.700]  the society and the civilization period they are converting us from a free
[41:07.700 --> 41:11.180]  society to a tyranny
[41:15.060 --> 41:22.140]  now I want to get back into the ISIS situation and then open the phones up
[41:22.140 --> 41:28.980]  and take your calls on this issue and a lot more but some of the stories up on
[41:28.980 --> 41:33.940]  info wars.com poll the latest from Gallup trusted mass media at all time low
[41:33.940 --> 41:39.700]  don't talk about what that means there's another new article in video out man
[41:39.700 --> 41:50.540]  humiliated for TSA triggers on his bottle of Chanel blue new recruits flock to
[41:50.540 --> 41:56.100]  ISIS following Obama speech dozens of children dead after UN gives tainted
[41:56.100 --> 42:02.420]  vaccine to rebel held Syria it's all about getting the UN into Iraq and all
[42:02.420 --> 42:05.900]  these places to shoot these kids up sterilize them yeah some are gonna have
[42:05.900 --> 42:11.700]  a bad response and that's the way it goes just the way it goes but it's just a
[42:11.700 --> 42:15.580]  footnote when it's much dead kids every day or two with vaccines and the insert
[42:15.580 --> 42:19.820]  say it can kill you but it's no big deal go take your guard still shot you know
[42:19.820 --> 42:23.060]  you can get a lot of attention for yourself when you bury your kid a lot
[42:23.060 --> 42:27.700]  of trendy moms out there a lot of soccer moms might like that DHS official
[42:27.700 --> 42:31.180]  claims border more secure than ever I mentioned that call your representative
[42:31.180 --> 42:36.060]  today vote no a military aid to Syrian rebels Washington blog story about that
[42:36.060 --> 42:40.580]  Russia's come out and said free Syrian armor army no longer exist rebels are
[42:40.580 --> 42:43.940]  coordinating with terrorist well that's what Colonel Schaeffer said a week and
[42:43.940 --> 42:48.700]  a half ago here he was up in a secret briefing on the hill and they said it's
[42:48.700 --> 42:53.260]  way above 65% and then I talked to another old source and they said in that
[42:53.260 --> 43:02.380]  briefing 95% the Congress knows that the Pentagon has told them that 95% is
[43:02.380 --> 43:07.260]  al-Qaeda and they don't want just like a year ago they didn't want to openly back
[43:07.260 --> 43:11.820]  the rebels and give them air support and the Pentagon is telling them in
[43:11.820 --> 43:18.060]  classified briefings right now do not do this there's no way these weapons won't
[43:18.060 --> 43:21.700]  go to al-Qaeda and it's more of a wink and a nod they just want to be on record
[43:21.700 --> 43:27.620]  not supporting this because it's corrupt as the military brass is this is
[43:27.620 --> 43:31.540]  really evil I mean they're going to go into Syria and kill every Christian in
[43:31.540 --> 43:34.660]  Jew they find and every non-radical Muslim and they're going to kill
[43:34.660 --> 43:39.620]  literally hundreds of thousands more and general Jack Dempsey for all of his
[43:39.620 --> 43:44.220]  problems went to Obama over a year ago and said do not attack Syria do not
[43:44.220 --> 43:48.180]  have backup al-Qaeda we're gonna have a rebellion in the armed forces and it's
[43:48.180 --> 43:52.860]  going to come out that you're aiding al-Qaeda so that's why I've said it's a
[43:52.860 --> 43:58.820]  real moral moment for the US military and for the FBI for that matter that are
[43:58.820 --> 44:01.740]  out arresting ISIS people when I guarantee you that's not who they've
[44:01.740 --> 44:04.700]  been told to target and they are being forced to release them or drop the
[44:04.700 --> 44:11.060]  cases but they're trying to go after these real people just like before 9
[44:11.060 --> 44:14.540]  11 the FBI was tracking the hijackers and trying to stop them being ordered
[44:14.540 --> 44:18.620]  to stand down and in Phoenix and in Minneapolis St. Paul and on and on and
[44:18.620 --> 44:23.700]  on their compartmentalized though their hands are tied so now Dempsey in
[44:23.700 --> 44:29.700]  testimony yesterday admitted that they know Arab allies who fund ISIS because
[44:29.700 --> 44:34.540]  they all know the 28 pages is set to come out and I've talked to Congressman
[44:34.540 --> 44:39.620]  Jones on air earlier this year I've talked to Colonel Schaefer and I've
[44:39.620 --> 44:44.260]  talked to other sources I'm just gonna leave I'm not gonna say anymore okay but
[44:44.260 --> 44:48.220]  it's known what's in the 28 pages and it's confirmed from our sources on air
[44:48.220 --> 44:55.100]  congressman that Saudi Arabia was in running the whole show and I'm not
[44:55.100 --> 45:01.260]  scapegoating just Saudi Arabia by saying Saudi Arabia was the quarterback the
[45:01.260 --> 45:05.780]  entire Western intelligence system the Germans the Israelis the British the
[45:05.780 --> 45:11.260]  CIA the NSA the FBI defense intelligence naval intelligence at the
[45:11.260 --> 45:18.900]  highest levels all new as well and the Joint Chiefs of Staff ABC News USA
[45:18.900 --> 45:24.220]  today cancelled a trip the week before 9 11 that was set for 9 11 to visit Wall
[45:24.220 --> 45:30.300]  Street instead Warren Buffett had all the major CEOs over 200 at a quote
[45:30.300 --> 45:35.060]  special invited event flume in the night before to meet at a secret hangar at
[45:35.060 --> 45:39.980]  Offit Air Force Base in Nebraska this is associated pressure I'm telling you and
[45:39.980 --> 45:43.500]  they were all told something at that event we don't know what it was it's
[45:43.500 --> 45:50.380]  classified say a high-level Warren Buffett as folks you understand I'm just
[45:50.380 --> 45:58.540]  giving you some nexus points here some dots but Saudi Arabia ran the
[45:58.540 --> 46:08.700]  operation and our government bare minimum new in order to stand down now it was
[46:08.700 --> 46:12.500]  very compartmentalized the computers were taken over at NORAD this came out in
[46:12.500 --> 46:17.380]  the 9 11 hearings the computers were taken over and they didn't call it a
[46:17.380 --> 46:20.420]  hack they said who's taking control the system what are all these simulations in
[46:20.420 --> 46:23.420]  here and they just laid airplanes and stuff all over everywhere where they
[46:23.420 --> 46:26.580]  couldn't tell what was going on that's the problem with everything everything
[46:26.580 --> 46:31.020]  wired into Skynet everything centralized every iPhone every droid every
[46:31.020 --> 46:35.940]  computer every new appliance wired in to get these codes with codes put into them
[46:35.940 --> 46:41.260]  that God knows who can go in and hijacker control and then no one knows
[46:41.260 --> 46:47.620]  what's going on South Korea is going entirely to giant robot centuries with
[46:47.620 --> 46:59.180]  50 cal and even higher caliber guns artillery was Napoleon's quote war is
[46:59.180 --> 47:09.180]  made with artillery Napoleon Bonaparte what a rudder Kipling say thank God the
[47:09.180 --> 47:18.940]  guns thank God the guns or what's the exact quote it's like the guns thank God
[47:18.940 --> 47:23.660]  for the guns the point is is that everything's converting to robots
[47:23.660 --> 47:28.740]  everything's converting to drones everything is converting right now this
[47:28.740 --> 47:33.180]  is a master Trojan horse takeover and they tell people the NSA what's being
[47:33.180 --> 47:37.260]  done to defeat other cyber systems in the future the Russians the Chinese it's
[47:37.260 --> 47:41.860]  above that the Chinese meet with the top globalist routinely and there's a
[47:41.860 --> 47:48.500]  double-cross going on and this is a Skynet takeover but the eugenicist
[47:48.500 --> 47:54.660]  transhumanist run it and they believe they are going to transcend humanity
[47:54.660 --> 47:59.460]  speaking of General Dempsey why not play that clip where he admitted that he
[47:59.460 --> 48:03.820]  knows of Arab allies who fund ISIS that's because we give the weapons to
[48:03.820 --> 48:11.340]  Qatar cutter we give the weapons to Saudi Arabia fence it to a third party
[48:11.340 --> 48:15.460]  plausible than I ability you know you go rob somebody's house you take it to a
[48:15.460 --> 48:21.180]  fence who then goes in who isn't the actual person doing it and then they
[48:21.180 --> 48:29.700]  sell it to the pawn shop it's the same thing give the weapons of Saudi Arabia
[48:29.700 --> 48:35.180]  and then the M16s the tow missiles the stingers and then they give it to Al Qaeda
[48:35.180 --> 48:40.020]  or the ambassadors at a substation with three warehouses full of stinger
[48:40.020 --> 48:43.580]  missiles you name it you just killing you just order stand down you send Al Qaeda
[48:43.580 --> 48:47.340]  who's a local security from Benghazi who runs the city send them over to kill
[48:47.340 --> 48:54.900]  them but to sheep dipped Navy Seals CIA commandos they didn't stand down they
[48:54.900 --> 48:58.500]  ran back so instead of it taking two hours to kill the ambassador it took six
[48:58.500 --> 49:03.220]  seven hours and so it was embarrassing as our military had to sit there and
[49:03.220 --> 49:06.740]  watch us stand down and see they've all now been made accomplices to it they
[49:06.740 --> 49:10.460]  don't like it they're like wow we really just killed our own ambassador and
[49:10.460 --> 49:14.180]  people to let a bunch of jihadi's kill them and they had to watch it on the
[49:14.180 --> 49:21.140]  overheads and six hours into it the order came from the White House to just
[49:21.140 --> 49:25.660]  turn it off so everybody's on ships they're at there in Italy they're at the
[49:25.660 --> 49:28.780]  military bases they're all I've talked to the people they're all sitting there
[49:28.780 --> 49:33.300]  watching in HD infrared not the stuff they show you on the news they can watch
[49:33.300 --> 49:36.540]  grasshoppers hopping around the ground with us just watching these jihadi's
[49:36.540 --> 49:40.420]  kill everybody watching them drag the ambassador around watching them offload
[49:40.420 --> 49:44.340]  the missiles and load them on trucks and take them where they took them and
[49:44.340 --> 49:47.980]  they're all going wow it's really all true our government runs Al Qaeda our
[49:47.980 --> 49:52.300]  government just killed everybody there so they could have plausible deniability
[49:52.300 --> 49:57.420]  with jihadi's who are then gonna hold the West hostage with the 15,000 stinger
[49:57.420 --> 50:01.780]  missiles and all the other goodies and when they shoot down airplanes or when
[50:01.780 --> 50:06.660]  they come across the border and blow stuff up dick Durbin will come out and
[50:06.660 --> 50:10.340]  say it's the anti-immigration lobby they didn't open the border so this
[50:10.340 --> 50:13.940]  happened he's in the news you're like but that doesn't make sense this is an
[50:13.940 --> 50:17.740]  overthrow of reality we're now witnessing here's the toll-free number I'm

[54:04.540 --> 54:28.260]  Jones only on the GCN radio network I love this Orwellian headline from the
[54:28.260 --> 54:35.100]  cladgy who I really respect is a news publication syndicate they're one of
[54:35.100 --> 54:40.300]  the only mainstream media outlets that I continue to see true groundbreaking real
[54:40.300 --> 54:46.340]  investigative journalism from Labor Department announces grants to fight
[54:46.340 --> 54:58.940]  tax sheets but that's in response to the Labor Department being caught letting
[54:58.940 --> 55:07.420]  big major Fortune 100 companies not pay taxes so you read the headline and you
[55:07.420 --> 55:13.780]  think oh the Labor Department's doing something good but they're not and then
[55:13.780 --> 55:18.220]  some people say well Alex aren't you for paying less taxes yeah but you can't
[55:18.220 --> 55:22.620]  have the ultra-rich avoiding the taxes because then they'll lobby to raise
[55:22.620 --> 55:26.860]  taxes on poor and working class and middle class to get more government
[55:26.860 --> 55:32.620]  contract money it's billionaires on average if you look it up lobby for
[55:32.620 --> 55:35.620]  bigger government and higher taxes because they're exempt and then they
[55:35.620 --> 55:39.580]  transfer the money to themselves and look I know I harp on this every week it's
[55:39.580 --> 55:44.260]  the key to everything they've got us all worried about what color we are and
[55:44.260 --> 55:51.500]  and fighting with each other over our genders and not trusting each other while
[55:51.500 --> 55:55.580]  the big mega banks run the country are getting rid of our sovereignty and have
[55:55.580 --> 55:58.900]  gotten tens of trillions of dollars and bank or bailout money and in this
[55:58.900 --> 56:06.700]  article admits at the federal and state level that the agencies literally do
[56:06.700 --> 56:17.140]  agreements saying big corporations don't have to pay their taxes and I meant
[56:17.140 --> 56:23.660]  to do a story on this I was at the gym yesterday on the elliptical and I picked
[56:23.660 --> 56:28.500]  up a GQ that somebody had left land in there and I read a bunch of articles and
[56:28.500 --> 56:34.140]  every article was how men need to act pathetic and weak to get women and how
[56:34.140 --> 56:39.020]  the new chivalry is you know how to be polite to women and not offend them was
[56:39.020 --> 56:42.740]  the cover story and I knew what I was gonna read before I read it was social
[56:42.740 --> 56:48.700]  engineering just well yes still grovel to women but they're your boss and still
[56:48.700 --> 56:53.500]  pay for everything and still do what they say and but but but you're pathetic
[56:53.500 --> 56:58.940]  yeah they found it how to be polite to one without making them angry it actually
[56:58.940 --> 57:03.260]  says something else but I'm not gonna say it on here so people are like why
[57:03.260 --> 57:06.540]  well we have a lot of very conservative radio listeners and I just like to keep
[57:06.540 --> 57:10.500]  it family but how to be polite women without you know whatting them off and
[57:10.500 --> 57:16.060]  then it was every article and then I start watching the TV ads where the
[57:16.060 --> 57:18.820]  executive never knows what he's doing if he's male and the woman tells him
[57:18.820 --> 57:24.060]  everything and it's just bombarding with this garbage of social engineering
[57:24.060 --> 57:32.180]  while a bunch of rich powerful men scam everybody it's just a wall-to-wall
[57:32.180 --> 57:36.460]  message to women is hate men put them down they're stupid you get ahead when
[57:36.460 --> 57:42.860]  they lose white people are all racist blah blah blah just political correctness
[57:42.860 --> 57:46.540]  is psychological warfare to screw the country up period I'm gonna come back

[1:00:12.740 --> 1:00:20.260]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[1:00:20.260 --> 1:00:32.740]  Alex Jones we're going to your phone calls right now now I'm gonna be
[1:00:32.740 --> 1:00:39.260]  blitzing through a ton of breaking news and information throughout the broadcast
[1:00:39.260 --> 1:00:44.580]  here's some of what's coming up seeing in reports of the headline let me translate
[1:00:44.580 --> 1:00:51.060]  this for you should read Isis adopts Obama's Common Core like I think I'm
[1:00:51.060 --> 1:00:55.620]  gonna have him post part of this CNN article at infowars.com and just change
[1:00:55.620 --> 1:01:00.940]  the headline to Isis adopts Obama's Common Core and here is the headline
[1:01:00.940 --> 1:01:07.580]  being serious Isis bans math social studies for children yes that's how
[1:01:07.580 --> 1:01:14.260]  evil this group is they want Stone Age mindless blithering idiots and that's
[1:01:14.260 --> 1:01:19.540]  why they are the choice for governance in the Middle East by the New World Order
[1:01:19.540 --> 1:01:24.900]  because they want a totally dumbed-down mindless population of idiots and
[1:01:24.900 --> 1:01:29.020]  that's why the State Department since the 50s has spent billions of dollars
[1:01:29.020 --> 1:01:33.740]  you can look this up teaching two plus two hand grenades equals four hand
[1:01:33.740 --> 1:01:38.260]  grenades so now the change is two plus two hand grenades each equals five
[1:01:38.260 --> 1:01:45.580]  hand grenades are just don't teach math period our government has literally
[1:01:45.580 --> 1:01:50.820]  helped radicalize the Middle East so it can then of course be destroyed and the
[1:01:50.820 --> 1:01:54.700]  jihadis don't care they just want to cut some children's heads off because
[1:01:54.700 --> 1:01:59.380]  they're trendy I'm sorry I shouldn't be politically incorrect I forgot Isis is
[1:01:59.380 --> 1:02:04.620]  not Islamic and the pink panther in pink let's go ahead and talk to Brandon in
[1:02:04.620 --> 1:02:10.580]  Tejas go ahead you're on the air how's it going Alex good brother what's on your
[1:02:10.580 --> 1:02:16.140]  mind today well first thing I just want to let you know before the question I
[1:02:16.140 --> 1:02:21.420]  asked you I do have a supermail vitality survival shield the citizens rulebook
[1:02:21.420 --> 1:02:27.940]  that you sent me and I need some more lung cleanse but I love the products that
[1:02:27.940 --> 1:02:31.580]  you sell and thank you brother I just wanted to say that first before I asked
[1:02:31.580 --> 1:02:38.460]  the question so the question is you talk about the 28-page document and how
[1:02:38.460 --> 1:02:43.460]  you're angry and there's actually a lot of other people like Ron Paul Ron Paul
[1:02:43.460 --> 1:02:50.780]  and everybody else that are angry about it but my question is why like why
[1:02:50.780 --> 1:02:57.700]  ultimately don't y'all which would pretty much you know cause a big you know
[1:02:57.700 --> 1:03:01.900]  like commotion or whatever and then me mainstream news why don't y'all like
[1:03:01.900 --> 1:03:07.140]  staying side-by-side and March well I hear you that's like herding cats to
[1:03:07.140 --> 1:03:11.660]  try to get Rand Paul and Ron Paul on the exact same page is pretty hard to do
[1:03:11.660 --> 1:03:17.180]  because they're both individualist I've had Walter Jones on this year in
[1:03:17.180 --> 1:03:21.460]  January when he introduced the bill we're gonna get Walter Jones back on if
[1:03:21.460 --> 1:03:26.220]  not this week next week he's in Congress I want to get Ron Paul on the next few
[1:03:26.220 --> 1:03:29.780]  weeks about his audit the Fed bill that even though he's not in Congress it's
[1:03:29.780 --> 1:03:35.700]  now been you know put back in and we're gonna talk about that I've been
[1:03:35.700 --> 1:03:40.580]  calling for the secret 9-11 report to be released since it was written was it
[1:03:40.580 --> 1:03:46.020]  2006 or so I'm going from memory and so yeah we should create a some type of
[1:03:46.020 --> 1:03:51.100]  hashtag to release the 28 pages and have an article about the 28 pages with our
[1:03:51.100 --> 1:03:55.900]  videos with Colonel Schaefer with Ron Paul I'll ask Paul Watson today he's good
[1:03:55.900 --> 1:04:00.220]  at stuff like that to put together an article tomorrow with a hashtag the
[1:04:00.220 --> 1:04:04.220]  deals with 28 pages with Ron Paul statement with Colonel Schaefer statement
[1:04:04.220 --> 1:04:09.060]  with Walter Jones statement and a link to the bill so that we can use the
[1:04:09.060 --> 1:04:14.260]  cyber system to try to push that tomorrow and so I'll make sure that gets
[1:04:14.260 --> 1:04:19.940]  done on the Thursday edition and we will push that together you can march with us
[1:04:19.940 --> 1:04:25.500]  in cyberspace and we can call for folks to create a march in Washington or
[1:04:25.500 --> 1:04:30.480]  something it's just very easy for the media to ignore a march it's not for
[1:04:30.480 --> 1:04:35.580]  them to ignore you on Facebook and Twitter and Yahoo and on YouTube just
[1:04:35.580 --> 1:04:39.020]  like the bucket challenge with cyber that's how the globalists try to control
[1:04:39.020 --> 1:04:44.100]  the internet to create false revolutions that they use and say we need to
[1:04:44.100 --> 1:04:49.380]  create real revolutions of understanding and get those 28 pages released so I
[1:04:49.380 --> 1:04:53.140]  really appreciate your call but we're gonna be pushing hard with Walter Jones
[1:04:53.140 --> 1:04:59.420]  Ron Paul Ron Paul and you the listeners more calls coming up stay with us

[1:08:22.940 --> 1:08:29.100]  we covered a lot of top stories democratic leader dick Durbin once total
[1:08:29.100 --> 1:08:34.380]  amnesty and open borders actually have the quotes here he said that that would
[1:08:34.380 --> 1:08:40.260]  contain Ebola so we said open borders might allow Ebola in and herola Rivera
[1:08:40.260 --> 1:08:44.020]  said that was racist again that's like saying two plus two equals four is
[1:08:44.020 --> 1:08:48.260]  racist but now they're saying open borders will stop Ebola just like you

[1:09:16.700 --> 1:09:21.460]  registering slightly higher trust last year Americans confidence in the media
[1:09:21.460 --> 1:09:24.740]  that's establishment media's ability to report the news fully accurately and
[1:09:24.740 --> 1:09:29.380]  fairly has returned to his previous all-time low of 40 percent I've seen
[1:09:29.380 --> 1:09:33.340]  numbers as low as 15 if you read the full poll Americans trust in mass media
[1:09:33.340 --> 1:09:37.660]  has generally been edging downward from higher levels in the late 1990s and the
[1:09:37.660 --> 1:09:43.900]  early 2000s yeah folks bought into it in the fear of 9-11 prior 2004 Americans
[1:09:43.900 --> 1:09:48.220]  place more trust in mass media than they do now with slim majority saying they
[1:09:48.220 --> 1:09:52.580]  had a great deal of fair amount of trust but over the course of former
[1:09:52.580 --> 1:09:57.380]  president George Bush reelection the level of trust pulsing evidently from
[1:09:57.380 --> 1:10:02.700]  54 to 44 in 2004 although trust levels were bounded to 50 percent 2005 they
[1:10:02.700 --> 1:10:08.300]  have failed to reach any full majority sense and then it goes over to yeah I've
[1:10:08.300 --> 1:10:13.540]  seen some of the polls as low as 13 14 percent and here are some of them trust
[1:10:13.540 --> 1:10:21.940]  in mass media by parting 27 percent 38 percent that's that's but some of these
[1:10:21.940 --> 1:10:26.540]  numbers again are as low as 27 percent that's a lot better than Congress though
[1:10:26.540 --> 1:10:33.260]  that has a 7 percent approval rating in a Gallup poll not a very legitimate
[1:10:33.260 --> 1:10:38.460]  government not a very legitimate government at all and that's why they
[1:10:38.460 --> 1:10:43.740]  want the schooling dumb down last night I was reading mainstream news articles
[1:10:43.740 --> 1:10:50.820]  about Common Core where they were defending it and they had stuff like
[1:10:50.820 --> 1:10:57.420]  seven plus five equals 11 and other just weird they go well it can be a
[1:10:57.420 --> 1:11:08.980]  little off and again the famous one two plus two equals five and I only marvel
[1:11:08.980 --> 1:11:17.940]  about that because even the Washington Post criticize it and calls it flim
[1:11:17.940 --> 1:11:24.180]  flames but it doesn't matter because they want to dump everybody down this is
[1:11:24.180 --> 1:11:28.380]  on purpose by the way I mentioned this earlier before I go to calls and I meant
[1:11:28.380 --> 1:11:31.060]  to search it during the break to prove it because it's so over the top guys type
[1:11:31.060 --> 1:11:37.300]  in state department paid billions to radicalize Muslims or state department
[1:11:37.300 --> 1:11:44.220]  paid for radical madrasas that's that's Islamic schools from the 50s through the
[1:11:44.220 --> 1:11:48.260]  90s when it got declassified I think the number was four billion dollars was
[1:11:48.260 --> 1:11:52.620]  spent to pay for textbooks in Arabic where it's like two hand grenades and
[1:11:52.620 --> 1:11:56.860]  two hand grenades equals four hand grenades or five swords versus five
[1:11:56.860 --> 1:12:02.620]  swords equals ten swords to kill infidels Americans and people ask well why
[1:12:02.620 --> 1:12:06.900]  would they over decades do this because they want the most radical dumb down
[1:12:06.900 --> 1:12:11.180]  people over there to destabilize the region and to have an enemy that's easy
[1:12:11.180 --> 1:12:15.260]  to demonize to go after you don't want industrialized first world countries
[1:12:15.260 --> 1:12:21.260]  like Dubai where you've got to go pay for everything just want to blow the
[1:12:21.260 --> 1:12:24.500]  country up deindustrialized it claim you're gonna fix it they want to fail
[1:12:24.500 --> 1:12:29.180]  state like they did in Libya again Obama didn't screw up with the quote failed
[1:12:29.180 --> 1:12:32.740]  state in Libya that was the plan now they go it's 20 times worse than it was
[1:12:32.740 --> 1:12:38.380]  it's hell on earth no electricity no water it was wonderful before that was
[1:12:38.380 --> 1:12:42.380]  the plan so I mentioned all that because of this headline out of CNN
[1:12:42.380 --> 1:12:48.140]  ISIS bans math social studies for children in swaths of Syria and uncontrolled
[1:12:48.140 --> 1:12:52.420]  by ISIS children can no longer study math or social studies sports are out of
[1:12:52.420 --> 1:12:56.060]  the question and students will be banned from learning about elections and
[1:12:56.060 --> 1:13:02.980]  democracy educators cannot teach nationalistic or ethnic ideology only
[1:13:02.980 --> 1:13:07.020]  service to the Islamic party so that's like the one-world government there is
[1:13:07.020 --> 1:13:11.220]  no nation there is no ethnic there is there's just the state the state that's
[1:13:11.220 --> 1:13:15.500]  why communists always ban churches not that churches can't be corrupt or be
[1:13:15.500 --> 1:13:20.900]  their own evil but when they become God not God but the state is always want to
[1:13:20.900 --> 1:13:24.980]  get rid of God because it's competition to them and if it's a God that says
[1:13:24.980 --> 1:13:31.460]  don't murder don't steal be honorable common-sense stuff they're like no no
[1:13:31.460 --> 1:13:36.420]  no no you get that from us just like it's confirmed now what us today have
[1:13:36.420 --> 1:13:41.940]  reported on it last week that you pray to Chavez in the school lunch program in
[1:13:41.940 --> 1:13:47.620]  Venezuela first you pray to Jesus and the milk and cereal and eggs don't arrive
[1:13:47.620 --> 1:13:53.940]  or whatever they're feeding that morning you pray to communism and Chavez and
[1:13:53.940 --> 1:13:59.180]  actually have a prayer so Lord's Prayer but to Chavez and you pray that to him
[1:13:59.180 --> 1:14:04.300]  and then you get milk well look at all the people that all they ever known is
[1:14:04.300 --> 1:14:07.620]  government welfare all they were known there it is Yahoo news Reuters
[1:14:07.620 --> 1:14:14.620]  Venezuelan Socialist Party swaps God for Chavez a new prayer and I remember
[1:14:14.620 --> 1:14:16.900]  talking to people I know from Venezuela they were telling me about this and I
[1:14:16.900 --> 1:14:19.500]  went and looked it up but I couldn't find it in Venezuela I found out the old
[1:14:19.500 --> 1:14:24.780]  Soviet Union and in communism to Mao they would pray to Mao in the rural
[1:14:24.780 --> 1:14:30.020]  villages man I don't want to worship your government God I mean I'm sorry just
[1:14:30.020 --> 1:14:35.460]  not gonna do it call me a erotic all you want and the churches say hey I've seen
[1:14:35.460 --> 1:14:39.140]  this in at least five mega churches I saw a compilation video I meant to air
[1:14:39.140 --> 1:14:43.380]  it so much research I don't ever get some air but you can look it up mega
[1:14:43.380 --> 1:14:49.220]  churches just type in preachers say Christians were wrong to not worship
[1:14:49.220 --> 1:14:55.260]  Roman gods or preacher says Roman Christians were wrong to not follow
[1:14:55.260 --> 1:15:00.060]  states orders that they should have worshipped Jupiter they should have
[1:15:00.060 --> 1:15:05.100]  worshipped Mars they they they should have gone to the public sacrifices at
[1:15:05.100 --> 1:15:08.460]  the gladiatorial events that's what they were that it was a violation of
[1:15:08.460 --> 1:15:13.020]  Romans 13 this is the founding church talk about blaspheme because their
[1:15:13.020 --> 1:15:18.060]  government run and I'm not up here on some high Christian horse myself I've
[1:15:18.060 --> 1:15:23.420]  been knocked off my horse a long time ago a thunderbolt of truth but these
[1:15:23.420 --> 1:15:29.060]  people will sit up there praying praying on them getting up there I've seen
[1:15:29.060 --> 1:15:36.340]  pastor Hage in the video say Christ was not the Messiah he was a rebel and was
[1:15:36.340 --> 1:15:43.700]  dealt with accordingly read my new book I mean he's not even teaching Christianity
[1:15:43.700 --> 1:15:49.020]  teaching Judaism but it's beyond that it's just this just anything but the
[1:15:49.020 --> 1:15:52.940]  Bible well that's what they want right here pretty much anything but the
[1:15:52.940 --> 1:15:59.500]  Koran stuff they're teaching as I've read the Koran this is a distortion and
[1:15:59.500 --> 1:16:02.860]  this is what's dominant in Islam now thanks to Saudi Arabia on the West it
[1:16:02.860 --> 1:16:06.060]  will be used to destroy the Middle East and all those people and they're letting
[1:16:06.060 --> 1:16:10.940]  them invade Africa invade Central Asia invade the Far East it is an al-Qaeda
[1:16:10.940 --> 1:16:23.820]  worldwide offensive and the globalist are behind it so the joke headline that I
[1:16:23.820 --> 1:16:29.460]  want for info or commons is not really a joke at satire is ISIS adopts Obama's
[1:16:29.460 --> 1:16:35.180]  common core for children and then just have the article see our headline will
[1:16:35.180 --> 1:16:44.540]  be ISIS adopts ISIS adopts Obama's common core for children then the sub
[1:16:44.540 --> 1:16:47.580]  headline will be the actual scene and headline that goes together like a
[1:16:47.580 --> 1:16:54.540]  horse and carriage bans social studies and math for children well here they
[1:16:54.540 --> 1:16:57.740]  don't say they banned it they just ban it and I've got the big banking
[1:16:57.740 --> 1:17:02.460]  association documents it was in the news back in 1898 stuff Americans are too

[1:24:21.740 --> 1:24:27.540]  killed even by dozens of men great work can't be done sensibly become insane
[1:24:27.540 --> 1:24:32.980]  and desperate in the way of the samurai it is defeatism to meditate and
[1:24:32.980 --> 1:24:38.500]  discriminate in between this and that it is the it is needless to reason about
[1:24:38.500 --> 1:24:49.500]  loyalty and final duty you only have to be desperate loyalty and fealty are
[1:24:49.500 --> 1:24:54.780]  spontaneously included in desperation since I mentioned that quote I thought
[1:24:54.780 --> 1:24:57.820]  I would actually read it to you and butcher it and then here is Prince Philip
[1:24:57.820 --> 1:25:03.060]  from the London Guardian 1988 you put that on screen for folks I mentioned this
[1:25:03.060 --> 1:25:08.540]  last hour in the event I am reincarnated I would like to return as a deadly virus
[1:25:08.540 --> 1:25:13.660]  to contribute something to solving overpopulation and he actually said it
[1:25:13.660 --> 1:25:20.380]  again to the World Wildlife Congress he said it to Reuters Der Spiegel we just
[1:25:20.380 --> 1:25:26.660]  found a quote in London Guardian just so you know that we're not making these
[1:25:26.660 --> 1:25:31.620]  quotes up and of course that Cicero quote is so key about the trader is the
[1:25:31.620 --> 1:25:35.100]  plague I want to cover that later but right now let's go to your phone calls
[1:25:35.100 --> 1:25:38.740]  Jay in Wisconsin thanks for calling thanks for holding you're on the air
[1:25:38.740 --> 1:25:45.340]  worldwide hey Alex I just wanted to mention something my phone is dying
[1:25:45.340 --> 1:25:50.740]  what's going on in Syria is right out of the book of Revelation 24 where they're
[1:25:50.740 --> 1:25:56.460]  putting there be headed for their faith and then I actually was watching you
[1:25:56.460 --> 1:25:59.660]  the other day when you were talking to a Syria girl and she mentioned something
[1:25:59.660 --> 1:26:04.380]  about the false flag in Turkey I was able to go on their website and download
[1:26:04.380 --> 1:26:08.420]  the document and give it to my governor so they're talking about that now here
[1:26:08.420 --> 1:26:12.580]  well it even came out in the British and Turkish papers that the government caught
[1:26:12.580 --> 1:26:18.820]  staging false flags against Syria and the foreign minister and the top general
[1:26:18.820 --> 1:26:23.260]  were caught and recorded by the Russians on an unsecure line going yeah
[1:26:23.260 --> 1:26:27.140]  we'll stage a false flag and and the minister's telling the army general how
[1:26:27.140 --> 1:26:31.300]  to stage false flags and the general says hey we know how to do it don't worry
[1:26:31.300 --> 1:26:36.660]  stop talking about it over the telephone and so they're just so arrogant
[1:26:36.660 --> 1:26:41.940]  that it's all being set up here to to expand the war against Syria but General
[1:26:41.940 --> 1:26:46.460]  Dempsey yesterday the chairman of the Joint Chiefs told Congress and I mentioned
[1:26:46.460 --> 1:26:50.620]  this last hour but but let's play the clip now that indeed we know our
[1:26:50.620 --> 1:26:57.420]  Arab allies are arming ISIS here's the clip I know major Arab allies who fund
[1:26:57.420 --> 1:27:00.980]  them yeah but did they embrace that they fund them because the Free Syrian army
[1:27:00.980 --> 1:27:04.740]  couldn't fight aside they were trying to be decide I think they realized the
[1:27:04.740 --> 1:27:11.780]  folly of their ways let's don't taint the mitties unfairly now the full clip
[1:27:11.780 --> 1:27:15.940]  maybe we should back up by the full clip as I have the transcript here
[1:27:16.220 --> 1:27:21.740]  senator Graham who's involved into his eyeballs with the other warmonger over
[1:27:21.740 --> 1:27:26.580]  there John McCain who admits he met with ISIS and has now attacked Rand Paul
[1:27:26.580 --> 1:27:31.820]  going senator how I ever chew met with them of course I've met with ISIS so
[1:27:31.820 --> 1:27:35.740]  he's quite proud of it that's the main fighting force so they got Graham and
[1:27:35.740 --> 1:27:43.300]  others trying to spin this back Jay like well I mean the Arab allies didn't know
[1:27:43.300 --> 1:27:47.420]  they were radical they didn't know who do you think Saudi Arabia is they
[1:27:47.420 --> 1:27:52.980]  created them so it's just incredible now how scared Graham and others are and
[1:27:52.980 --> 1:27:57.820]  they should be because when Al Qaeda blows stuff up in America everybody knows
[1:27:57.820 --> 1:28:04.260]  who to blame Obama and McCain and all you people I'm sorry go ahead Jay no I
[1:28:04.260 --> 1:28:08.740]  agree with you I mean the stuff is out there often is documented they think like
[1:28:08.740 --> 1:28:13.540]  us here girls that they think we have memories of goldfish you know they
[1:28:13.540 --> 1:28:16.940]  think we're not paying attention but we're awake a lot of the people I know
[1:28:16.940 --> 1:28:22.380]  here in my community I politically awaken now we're very informed so we're
[1:28:22.380 --> 1:28:25.500]  paying attention and we're praying for you and I just want to let you know the
[1:28:25.500 --> 1:28:28.580]  things that we're going on and don't forget that the beheadings are right
[1:28:28.580 --> 1:28:33.860]  out of revelation 20 and 4 I hear you it is frightening how much of this
[1:28:33.860 --> 1:28:38.340]  parallels revelation but if you look at others that's happened in history it
[1:28:38.340 --> 1:28:42.940]  parallels it the Bible says there are many antichrist and then there's the
[1:28:42.940 --> 1:28:47.220]  finally the man of sin the big one but everything in this universe goes in
[1:28:47.220 --> 1:28:53.460]  waves it builds up in cycles it peaks and then it goes back down again so we're
[1:28:53.460 --> 1:28:58.020]  we're building building building evil is being invented there's a Bible verse
[1:28:58.020 --> 1:29:04.660]  about the evil ones running around inventing new forms of evil creating
[1:29:04.660 --> 1:29:10.340]  new abominations creating new forms of weirdness and corruption and then trying
[1:29:10.340 --> 1:29:15.180]  to force it on the world population so genetic engineering hydrogen bombs
[1:29:15.180 --> 1:29:21.500]  nanotech yes it's all right out of the vision that John the rebelator had on
[1:29:21.500 --> 1:29:26.100]  the Isle of Patmos and it's an amazing time to be alive but meanwhile the
[1:29:26.100 --> 1:29:30.020]  churches have been captured by the government by and large I don't just
[1:29:30.020 --> 1:29:34.060]  mean they're 501 C3 I mean they go to meetings with the FBI with Homeland
[1:29:34.060 --> 1:29:37.660]  Security and they've got files on their practitioners and they are now
[1:29:37.660 --> 1:29:43.140]  government agents and I will assure you they will tell you to go to the FEMA camp
[1:29:43.140 --> 1:29:47.620]  give order to that's in the documents they played the newscast on Monday I'm

[1:33:18.220 --> 1:33:27.340]  maintain their liberty must be eternally vigilant quote a founding father but now
[1:33:27.340 --> 1:33:37.620]  we are literally overrun by traders as Cicero said the trader is the plague and
[1:33:37.620 --> 1:33:45.660]  I wanted to play the full Dempsey clip here where Graham is trying to cover his
[1:33:45.660 --> 1:33:49.820]  bases and how do you know any allies that are funding him like like we don't
[1:33:49.820 --> 1:33:55.140]  know we're not funding him we're not giving him weapons in Benghazi and Dempsey
[1:33:55.140 --> 1:34:00.500]  knowingly looks at him and raises an eyebrow and goes yeah we got allies that
[1:34:00.500 --> 1:34:05.220]  are arming them and then Graham goes hey let's just not demonize the whole
[1:34:05.220 --> 1:34:11.220]  Middle East here and the message is hey I'm on the defense committee I'm the
[1:34:11.220 --> 1:34:18.260]  powerful senator you follow orders and play ball and help me cover our butts
[1:34:19.340 --> 1:34:24.060]  because again the whole government's not corrupt and this is the establishment
[1:34:24.060 --> 1:34:29.300]  trying to get our military for multiple years to get behind openly joining with
[1:34:29.300 --> 1:34:33.060]  Saudi Arabia and Al Qaeda to take over the whole Middle East and as much as our
[1:34:33.060 --> 1:34:38.220]  military isn't in love with Iran they realize who the bigger jihadi threat is
[1:34:38.220 --> 1:34:47.460]  of radicalization and that is the 79 percent Sunnis who are dominated by the
[1:34:47.460 --> 1:34:59.860]  minority Wahabiite Al Qaeda nutcase crazy town dark ages bad people who again
[1:34:59.860 --> 1:35:06.860]  will be used to attack the West why to take our liberty and then have plausible
[1:35:06.860 --> 1:35:09.900]  deniability well let me tell you something government the 28 pages are
[1:35:09.900 --> 1:35:14.300]  coming out where our government stood down when Saudi Arabia ran 9-11 that
[1:35:14.300 --> 1:35:17.740]  makes you complicit it's already been seen by Congress the words already out
[1:35:17.740 --> 1:35:23.060]  out on this show earlier this year and just like a crack in the dam nothing
[1:35:23.060 --> 1:35:27.860]  happened when we first reported that right after he introduced the belt and
[1:35:27.860 --> 1:35:33.180]  then now eight months later it is huge news and it's got the whole government
[1:35:33.180 --> 1:35:37.220]  scared and and most people in the government weren't involved most people
[1:35:37.220 --> 1:35:41.100]  that are in the Joint Chiefs now weren't involved
[1:35:41.100 --> 1:35:45.780]  clearly they had an aura I knew what was going on back at the time and he got
[1:35:45.780 --> 1:35:50.020]  promoted to be the head of the Joint Chiefs at that time and so people don't
[1:35:50.020 --> 1:35:54.420]  want to be part of this they know the House of Cards are coming down and the
[1:35:54.420 --> 1:35:57.380]  globalists think their House of Cards is designed to come down and give them
[1:35:57.380 --> 1:36:02.340]  more power at each new crisis they create that's not gonna happen forever
[1:36:02.340 --> 1:36:07.780]  because the average person whether they're an auto mechanic or a farmer or an
[1:36:07.780 --> 1:36:12.340]  FBI agent or a police officer or a school teacher or a factory worker or a
[1:36:12.340 --> 1:36:17.820]  bus driver or somebody that works at McDonald's loves their kids and wants
[1:36:17.820 --> 1:36:21.740]  to just have a future and we're sick of a bunch of corrupt political Wall Street
[1:36:21.740 --> 1:36:28.300]  people creating hundreds of trillions it's actually 2.2 quadrillion
[1:36:28.300 --> 1:36:32.420]  according to the New York Times a month ago I keep saying 1.5 quadrillion
[1:36:32.420 --> 1:36:38.500]  that's an old number it's 2.2 the World Bank IMF now say two thousand two hundred
[1:36:38.500 --> 1:36:42.580]  trillion in fake derivatives you people are the ones threatening the whole
[1:36:42.580 --> 1:36:48.860]  world with Zimbabwe Weimar Republic meltdown and and the American people are
[1:36:48.860 --> 1:36:52.580]  going the police and military getting the training manuals demonizing the
[1:36:52.580 --> 1:36:56.140]  founding fathers and gun owners and Christians and being told the Tea Party
[1:36:56.140 --> 1:37:02.060]  wants to kill them they know that's propaganda and then they know the next
[1:37:02.060 --> 1:37:06.340]  step means you're gonna pull something and blame us to start a civil war people
[1:37:06.340 --> 1:37:11.380]  know we're up to the edge now people don't want to go over the edge people
[1:37:11.380 --> 1:37:14.380]  don't want your world government we don't want cloward and piven we don't
[1:37:14.380 --> 1:37:17.780]  want to be poor we don't want to be slaves we don't want to be spot on we
[1:37:17.780 --> 1:37:22.180]  don't want microphones at the park listening to us we want a future so
[1:37:22.180 --> 1:37:27.900]  everybody in the system better decide now corporate public private I don't care
[1:37:27.900 --> 1:37:33.020]  all these churches all these glitterbug preachers who know full well their
[1:37:33.020 --> 1:37:35.860]  clergy response team and got a little government card and go to monthly
[1:37:35.860 --> 1:37:41.060]  government meetings and are deceiving your public you're an agent of Caesar
[1:37:41.060 --> 1:37:48.300]  violating the First Amendment you're an agent of Herod and you're not even to
[1:37:48.300 --> 1:37:52.140]  me oh I guess it all got launched when 24 was the top show and it was kind of fun
[1:37:52.140 --> 1:37:55.620]  to be a secret agent now you realize it's not cool it's called being a
[1:37:55.620 --> 1:38:02.860]  collaborator loose lips sink ships well see something say something we see
[1:38:02.860 --> 1:38:08.820]  something we are saying something so when you see tyranny in your colleges or in
[1:38:08.820 --> 1:38:14.140]  your churches or in your businesses you better report on it
[1:38:15.540 --> 1:38:21.060]  let's play the full demcy clip and we'll go to Jeffrey and others go ahead so our
[1:38:21.060 --> 1:38:27.860]  national defense in turn stopping ISIL from killing thousands or millions of
[1:38:27.860 --> 1:38:32.100]  Americans they get the capability really comes down to whether or not we can
[1:38:32.100 --> 1:38:39.060]  convince the Arab world to go in there and defeat these guys it really comes
[1:38:39.060 --> 1:38:45.420]  down to building a coalition so that that what the Arab Muslim world sees is
[1:38:45.420 --> 1:38:52.380]  them rejecting ISIS not they already reject ISIL do you know any major Arab
[1:38:52.380 --> 1:38:58.140]  ally that embraces ISIL I know major Arab allies who fund them yeah but did
[1:38:58.140 --> 1:39:01.340]  they embrace that they find them because the Free Syrian Army couldn't fight
[1:39:01.340 --> 1:39:04.940]  aside they were trying to be decide I think they realized the folly of their
[1:39:04.940 --> 1:39:12.060]  ways let's don't tank the mideast unfairly and MC is looking at him like I
[1:39:12.060 --> 1:39:15.700]  have never seen such a load of you know what dumped out in the middle of a
[1:39:15.700 --> 1:39:20.540]  Senate hearing I mean Dempsey knows full well they were ordered to ship hundreds
[1:39:20.540 --> 1:39:25.700]  of C-130s of weapons right into camps with Al Qaeda flags flapping I've talked
[1:39:25.700 --> 1:39:34.380]  to the people that saw it that's how dangerous this game is the 28 pages are
[1:39:34.380 --> 1:39:38.820]  gonna come out all of it's coming out boys and I'm gonna tell you something
[1:39:38.820 --> 1:39:43.460]  don't nuke a city and claim ISIS or ISIL did it to confuse us we know who's
[1:39:43.460 --> 1:39:47.900]  behind it you let it happen bare minimum and you're probably gonna be behind it
[1:39:47.900 --> 1:39:51.980]  completely all right I'm going to your calls now Jeffery in Michigan and Scott
[1:39:51.980 --> 1:39:59.020]  in North Carolina Terry Zach Truth man we're going to all of you go ahead Scott
[1:39:59.020 --> 1:40:08.980]  all right go ahead Scott here yes I can oh hey Alex how you doing good big big
[1:40:08.980 --> 1:40:14.620]  fan thank you brother I had a lot you're interested in theory when I was like
[1:40:14.620 --> 1:40:19.180]  listening to her today about the Ebola outbreak in Africa and how it is like
[1:40:19.180 --> 1:40:22.540]  kind of new case and they kind of you know you know they're pushing vaccines
[1:40:22.540 --> 1:40:27.100]  on people you know with the flu vaccines to what I'm worried about Alex is
[1:40:27.100 --> 1:40:31.580]  once this gets so bad they get out of control they're gonna start forcing a
[1:40:31.580 --> 1:40:36.580]  bowl of vaccination which which obviously will not you know cure it or
[1:40:36.580 --> 1:40:41.420]  even you know make you worse for what matter because I worked in a hospital and
[1:40:41.420 --> 1:40:46.980]  and you would get fired if you did not take the flu shot I mean and that and
[1:40:46.980 --> 1:40:52.260]  that forced theory and he's going government run places there is there's
[1:40:52.260 --> 1:40:56.740]  a polling name well that's right for those that don't know it's come out all
[1:40:56.740 --> 1:41:01.700]  over New York Daily News you name it that for about six years or so at
[1:41:01.700 --> 1:41:06.380]  government facilities federal workers hospital workers they go you will take
[1:41:06.380 --> 1:41:10.580]  all these shots or you will be fired even though really the law says you
[1:41:10.580 --> 1:41:14.100]  can't do that and even though it actually causes outbreaks weakens immune
[1:41:14.100 --> 1:41:20.180]  systems causes mutations all sorts of stuff they are just forced to sure or by
[1:41:20.180 --> 1:41:26.180]  fiat order trying to push a de facto forced vaccine campaign in this
[1:41:26.180 --> 1:41:31.180]  country and it's disgusting oh it's just terrible I mean and what scares me
[1:41:31.180 --> 1:41:35.380]  Alex is because I think they were trying to weaponize the boy in Africa and
[1:41:35.380 --> 1:41:39.380]  it's somehow leaked out whether it be monkey got wet out of the back of room
[1:41:39.380 --> 1:41:44.020]  who knows I mean but it got out and got new villages and now it's just a
[1:41:44.020 --> 1:41:47.980]  pre-crawl and he's globally for letting it happen on purpose because this is
[1:41:47.980 --> 1:41:53.580]  their saving grace that we kill off most of the population so they can you know
[1:41:53.580 --> 1:41:57.900]  from your agenda I mean it really makes you fit well I've always said about the
[1:41:57.900 --> 1:42:04.620]  Ebola outbreak that I believe the first big plagues the 21st century cell phone
[1:42:04.620 --> 1:42:07.820]  brain tumors that'll be covered up all the neurological disorders from
[1:42:07.820 --> 1:42:12.300]  vaccines that'll be covered up as a practice of how they manage covering
[1:42:12.300 --> 1:42:15.620]  things up as it actually reduces the population but then they'll have big
[1:42:15.620 --> 1:42:19.700]  events with Ebola or mouse pox I've predicted and now we're seeing Ebola
[1:42:19.700 --> 1:42:23.780]  that'll wipe out hundreds of thousands then millions then they'll put in a
[1:42:23.780 --> 1:42:28.740]  medical tyranny with forced inoculations around stopping that to
[1:42:28.740 --> 1:42:32.980]  actually weaken us and get us ready to release a pathogen that only kills
[1:42:32.980 --> 1:42:38.220]  those of us that already had the binary GMOs or vaccines in us so that when the
[1:42:38.220 --> 1:42:42.180]  other part is introduced a binary weapon is where it needs two or more things to
[1:42:42.180 --> 1:42:46.140]  activate and that's the only weapon will deploy against us if something they've
[1:42:46.140 --> 1:42:49.580]  already tested they've already mutated they already know the chain of
[1:42:49.580 --> 1:42:53.540]  mutations is going to go through so that it will have an computer modeled
[1:42:53.540 --> 1:42:57.980]  effect so they can be ready and again the average person involved will know
[1:42:57.980 --> 1:43:03.460]  nothing it'll be modeled and managed to test some subplagues they only kill 5
[1:43:03.460 --> 1:43:08.140]  million 10 million 20 million ahead of a mega weapon that'll then later be
[1:43:08.140 --> 1:43:12.620]  released that'll kill 90% of the population and that's what the globalist
[1:43:12.620 --> 1:43:17.220]  and all their publications say is 90% what they're gonna whack when you get
[1:43:17.220 --> 1:43:22.660]  deeper into their documents they go well really humans are a disease only a few
[1:43:22.660 --> 1:43:26.740]  elite will be allowed to live will emerge with machines and be God and you
[1:43:26.740 --> 1:43:30.820]  can't have too many gods so in a lot of their documents if you read deeper they
[1:43:30.820 --> 1:43:34.500]  even talk about there being one being that comes out of this survival of the
[1:43:34.500 --> 1:43:41.980]  fittest social Darwin mega race and so there can be only one God kind of comes
[1:43:41.980 --> 1:43:46.100]  down to that and that's the point we've now reached now whether this is all real
[1:43:46.100 --> 1:43:51.780]  or theoretical the point is the elite are open about their religion this is
[1:43:51.780 --> 1:43:56.660]  their holy grail this is their brass ring this is their goal this is their
[1:43:56.660 --> 1:44:01.540]  promised land that this is this is what they want to do and so anyone that
[1:44:01.540 --> 1:44:07.860]  ignores this does so at insane levels of peril because once you know their
[1:44:07.860 --> 1:44:12.460]  master plan then everything makes sense and no matter how bad the tragedies are
[1:44:12.460 --> 1:44:16.540]  how many they kill we're just unconscious animals we're just a plague hurting the
[1:44:16.540 --> 1:44:20.540]  earth they're the guardians of the galaxy they're the guardians of the earth
[1:44:20.540 --> 1:44:26.860]  and they know best in the end and they are going to attain this godhood they
[1:44:26.860 --> 1:44:30.940]  are going to achieve Elysium and then once they've achieved Elysium the golden
[1:44:30.940 --> 1:44:39.540]  fields of the demigod they will then take the fire of Promethean power and
[1:44:39.540 --> 1:44:43.540]  ascend to the stars on a stairway of heaven appreciate your call
[1:44:43.540 --> 1:44:48.540]  Zach in Florida you're on the air worldwide go ahead hey you know Alex
[1:44:48.540 --> 1:44:52.700]  great show so far I just wanted to tell you about a term that actually came to
[1:44:52.700 --> 1:44:56.220]  me in a dream for some reason sometime in dreams of vocabulary is a little
[1:44:56.220 --> 1:45:01.260]  better than in real life but the term that came to me was a PTSD and it's not
[1:45:01.260 --> 1:45:05.540]  post-traumatic stress disorder it's post-traumatic society disorder I mean
[1:45:05.540 --> 1:45:09.540]  we're inundated with the lies the deception all the crap every day it's
[1:45:09.540 --> 1:45:13.660]  tough we're all suffering from and then encompasses it it's a post traumatic
[1:45:13.660 --> 1:45:19.460]  society disorder and we're all suffering everybody has Americans no you're
[1:45:19.460 --> 1:45:23.260]  right and this is the learned helplessness where they apply more and
[1:45:23.260 --> 1:45:27.420]  more and more pressure until in the animal studies and human studies we
[1:45:27.420 --> 1:45:32.660]  just give up roll over and give up and and that's the goal just give up give up
[1:45:32.660 --> 1:45:36.660]  let the robots roll out buy your goods from Apple with the suicide nets at
[1:45:36.660 --> 1:45:40.860]  their factories forced abortion it's trendy it's liberal look Al Gore war
[1:45:40.860 --> 1:45:45.340]  different color socks it's okay you know robot sentries are here to help take
[1:45:45.340 --> 1:45:50.300]  your GMOs we love you we love you we love you forced abortion is good and
[1:45:50.300 --> 1:45:54.700]  fantasize is good euthanizing old people's good death panels for vets is
[1:45:54.700 --> 1:45:59.260]  good humanity's trash the only way you have value is to agree to that and join
[1:45:59.260 --> 1:46:03.340]  the anti-human exterminist team then you'll be a winner then you'll at least
[1:46:03.340 --> 1:46:07.700]  feel like you're on the bandwagon before we destroy you this is their plan
[1:46:07.700 --> 1:46:12.740]  exactly and the only way to break out of that is just to be the best example that
[1:46:12.740 --> 1:46:16.940]  you could be detoxify your body talk to fire mine and be an example for the
[1:46:16.940 --> 1:46:19.900]  people in your community I mean I gotta tell you I'm the triple threat I'm an
[1:46:19.900 --> 1:46:24.300]  Arab American I'm a United States Army veteran and I'm a libertarian you want
[1:46:24.300 --> 1:46:28.100]  to talk about being demonized it's incredible but we can't get bogged down
[1:46:28.100 --> 1:46:31.500]  with that what we have to do is just be the best example in the purest form
[1:46:31.500 --> 1:46:35.660]  moving forward so the people around you gravitate towards you I mean that's the
[1:46:35.660 --> 1:46:41.500]  only way I can see it at this point I'm sorry one of my producers just walked in
[1:46:41.500 --> 1:46:46.580]  absolutely great points you're making sir yeah I mean it's a it's strange
[1:46:46.580 --> 1:46:50.660]  being being Arab American being a veteran and also being a libertarian I'm
[1:46:50.660 --> 1:46:54.340]  under attack all the time whether it's the community understanding the Arab
[1:46:54.340 --> 1:46:59.180]  culture due to the just a deception of propaganda that's pushed on TV in the
[1:46:59.180 --> 1:47:02.220]  current war and the rest of it being a veteran we all know how they're under
[1:47:02.220 --> 1:47:06.140]  attack at which I am also being libertarian from all fronts were under
[1:47:06.140 --> 1:47:09.700]  attack and I just feel like that all the time but like I said just be the best
[1:47:09.700 --> 1:47:13.700]  example moving forward and nobody can really tell you exactly exactly the best
[1:47:13.700 --> 1:47:17.180]  way to take out I appreciate your call sir God bless you the best way to take
[1:47:17.180 --> 1:47:25.500]  out your opposition is to lead it and the globalist we have gone in the
[1:47:25.500 --> 1:47:30.300]  Middle East for at least 60 years we're really a hundred and have tried to put
[1:47:30.300 --> 1:47:36.260]  the most radical out-of-control people in who have taken a system when you
[1:47:36.260 --> 1:47:41.900]  look at Syria and you look at Persia and you look at Lebanon and you look at
[1:47:41.900 --> 1:47:48.020]  Jordan I mean this is where mathematics and writing and super high IQ people
[1:47:48.020 --> 1:47:55.500]  live and they've had long histories of different levels of freedom and then you
[1:47:55.500 --> 1:48:04.020]  look at who they put in charge it is the most radical and the plan is to build
[1:48:04.020 --> 1:48:07.340]  up an enemy let them kill a bunch of people and then wipe them out as well
[1:48:07.340 --> 1:48:11.540]  but you have to understand it's the same plan here it's like with the malicious
[1:48:11.540 --> 1:48:15.140]  they would send feds out in the early 90s this has all been declassified you
[1:48:15.140 --> 1:48:19.140]  can look it up congressional hearings and create militia groups and lead them
[1:48:19.140 --> 1:48:25.940]  and have them say racist stuff and have them go out and be on TV and things to
[1:48:25.940 --> 1:48:29.100]  then demonize the idea of the militia that's totally constitutional and good
[1:48:29.100 --> 1:48:34.780]  because the globalist knew that that there was a threat from that just like
[1:48:34.780 --> 1:48:37.900]  they knew that revolution was coming in the Middle East for liberty so the
[1:48:37.900 --> 1:48:42.580]  globalist went in and triggered it and put radical jihadis in instead of
[1:48:42.580 --> 1:48:48.060]  moderates and secular folks and people that want civilization so that they
[1:48:48.060 --> 1:48:52.620]  could lead the revolutions and wreck the society they knew a revolution was
[1:48:52.620 --> 1:48:55.660]  coming against the big banks looting us they wanted to make it left-wing so
[1:48:55.660 --> 1:49:00.260]  conservatives would reject it and back Wall Street no matter what they did so
[1:49:00.260 --> 1:49:04.980]  they created the radicalized socialist communist occupy Wall Street movement
[1:49:04.980 --> 1:49:08.940]  radicalized it police ship drugs in this came out mainstream news we first broke
[1:49:08.940 --> 1:49:13.540]  it in Minnesota there is giving them drugs so they could then say you know in
[1:49:13.540 --> 1:49:16.100]  their surveillance tapes look there about the drug addicts to bring the
[1:49:16.100 --> 1:49:21.180]  homeless in to then demonize the idea of being against banker bailouts and then
[1:49:21.180 --> 1:49:24.900]  Homeland Security they were done with them had a 36 city SWAT raid on them
[1:49:24.900 --> 1:49:29.900]  arresting people with plans to even shoot the leaders if they were given
[1:49:29.900 --> 1:49:35.900]  order to do so so then they set the precedent on total martial law shoot
[1:49:35.900 --> 1:49:42.740]  to kill 007 Nazi style garbage all off a Psyop they wound up to begin with so
[1:49:42.740 --> 1:49:47.820]  people go why aren't you for Occupy because I identified it we went and had
[1:49:47.820 --> 1:49:53.380]  in the Fed rallies in three cities in Texas and in San Antonio and Dallas the
[1:49:53.380 --> 1:49:58.020]  Occupy people were totally mad communist and were mad that we were there
[1:49:58.020 --> 1:50:01.540]  protesting the private fellow reserve and we're demonizing us it wasn't us
[1:50:01.540 --> 1:50:06.180]  demonizing them we were nice we were there to say hey Wall Street isn't bad
[1:50:06.180 --> 1:50:10.140]  select mega banks inside of it that are above the law are the ones that are
[1:50:10.140 --> 1:50:12.340]  bad
[1:50:15.340 --> 1:50:21.740]  because it's not just banks are good or banks are bad it's that you've got
[1:50:21.740 --> 1:50:25.660]  mega banks that are above the law don't pay taxes run the regulations that get
[1:50:25.660 --> 1:50:30.100]  your tax money and bailouts look at who funds the gun control grips the victim

[1:54:08.060 --> 1:54:13.860]  ago health and human services ready US hospitals for Ebola states though are
[1:54:13.860 --> 1:54:19.740]  continued to be kept in the dark about severity of the often fatal disease
[1:54:19.740 --> 1:54:26.780]  continuing with your phone calls here in just a moment I I mentioned how our
[1:54:26.780 --> 1:54:30.660]  nation can survive basic corruption it can survive all sorts of stuff but when
[1:54:30.660 --> 1:54:43.860]  you have predatory traitorous evil that wants to extinguish all opposition to
[1:54:43.860 --> 1:54:51.300]  the point of extinguishing all prosperity like North Korea has done
[1:54:51.300 --> 1:54:57.220]  when something's that dark it's got to be resisted it will destroy everything you
[1:54:57.220 --> 1:55:03.140]  join with this you join with pure evil is the point I'm getting it and Cicero
[1:55:03.140 --> 1:55:08.020]  who was a member of the Roman Senate and of course try to stop Caesar's takeover
[1:55:08.020 --> 1:55:14.620]  was also a historian he wrote this or actually spoke this in the Roman Senate
[1:55:14.620 --> 1:55:20.260]  and this applies to the whole ruling class here because that's who you are
[1:55:20.260 --> 1:55:26.700]  you're the plague a nation can survive its fools and even the ambitious but it
[1:55:26.700 --> 1:55:30.460]  cannot survive treason from within an enemy at the gates is less formidable
[1:55:30.460 --> 1:55:36.340]  for he is known and carries his banner openly but the traitor moves amongst
[1:55:36.340 --> 1:55:43.620]  those within the gate freely his fly whispers rustling through all the alleys
[1:55:43.620 --> 1:55:47.940]  heard in the very halls of government itself for the traitor appears and not a
[1:55:47.940 --> 1:55:53.940]  traitor he speaks in actions familiar to his victims and he wears their face and
[1:55:53.940 --> 1:55:59.060]  their arguments he appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts
[1:55:59.060 --> 1:56:03.500]  of all men he rots the soul of a nation he works secretly and unknown in the
[1:56:03.500 --> 1:56:07.980]  night to undermine the pillars of the city he infects the body politic so
[1:56:07.980 --> 1:56:12.300]  that it can no longer resist a murderer is less to fear the traitor is the
[1:56:12.300 --> 1:56:21.940]  plug that was said I think at about 41 BC right before he got killed in 43 BC the
[1:56:21.940 --> 1:56:28.420]  sword down between the shoulder blade into the heart executed
[1:56:31.540 --> 1:56:37.860]  I forget that he survived Caesar and was it Mark Anthony had him killed
[1:56:37.860 --> 1:56:42.180]  history's a fascinating thing the more you learn of it the more it just all
[1:56:42.180 --> 1:56:46.540]  conflates together but very interesting picture emerges when you look at the
[1:56:46.540 --> 1:56:50.500]  current state we're in and you can tell this thing's going viral the tyranny's
[1:56:50.500 --> 1:56:54.740]  growing like a metastasizing blob following Julius Caesar's death Cicero
[1:56:54.740 --> 1:56:57.940]  became an enemy of Mark Anthony yeah he's the one that killed him in the
[1:56:57.940 --> 1:57:02.100]  ensuing power struggle attacking him in a series of speeches he was prescribed
[1:57:02.100 --> 1:57:07.540]  as an enemy of the state by the second triumph for it and consequently killed
[1:57:07.540 --> 1:57:12.700]  in 43 BC well my memory serves all right let's get another call before we go to
[1:57:12.700 --> 1:57:16.500]  break Jeffrey I'm sorry went to you and said somebody else that's why we skipped

[1:57:24.420 --> 1:57:28.500]  to the tipping point of the vaccine fraud yes good job thank you thank you I
[1:57:28.500 --> 1:57:33.540]  wanted to just say we are at a tipping point and CNN attempted a couple days
[1:57:33.540 --> 1:57:38.700]  ago or about a week ago tried to double down on the fraud and say that vaccines
[1:57:38.700 --> 1:57:42.300]  do not cause autism and what happened was mothers and fathers with autistic
[1:57:42.300 --> 1:57:46.860]  kids mobilized and started a YouTube campaign much like the soldiers did when
[1:57:46.860 --> 1:57:50.700]  we tried to go into Syria the soldiers started a campaign and they did YouTube
[1:57:50.700 --> 1:57:55.860]  and pictures and said I did not enlist to to fight on the side of al Qaeda at the
[1:57:55.860 --> 1:57:59.660]  time they were called and it backed off it backed off that war and we can back
[1:57:59.660 --> 1:58:04.540]  this the we can force an investigation we can force the issue now it's up to the
[1:58:04.540 --> 1:58:08.780]  doctors and mothers and fathers daily are continuing to post these pictures and
[1:58:08.780 --> 1:58:11.780]  these videos up there with that's right not only is singing in the rest of the
[1:58:11.780 --> 1:58:15.940]  collaborator media not reported on two CDC whistleblowers one of them who
[1:58:15.940 --> 1:58:19.060]  authored the study admitting they were basically ordered to lie about it and it
[1:58:19.060 --> 1:58:25.620]  was tripling autism obviously the set of reporting that oh whistleblowers are
[1:58:25.620 --> 1:58:29.300]  coming out they doubled down and said vaccines are perfect never hurt anybody
[1:58:29.300 --> 1:58:32.700]  will tell that to all the dead kids in Syria that just got shot up with the
[1:58:32.700 --> 1:58:36.860]  un vaccines stay there I'm gonna come back to you Jeffrey then truth man truth

[1:58:43.780 --> 1:58:53.900]  towers of it really no secret at all in the near future when you realize how
[1:58:53.900 --> 1:58:58.780]  fake it all is the football the basketball security alert this is
[1:58:58.780 --> 1:59:03.980]  homeland security analysis info wars building independent media operation
[1:59:03.980 --> 1:59:08.940]  but the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible
[1:59:08.940 --> 1:59:14.060]  prime director discredit Alex Jones Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy
[1:59:14.060 --> 1:59:18.540]  theory popular conspiracy theory talk show called info wars Alex Jones is
[1:59:18.540 --> 1:59:23.540]  now in an Austin jail these people are assaulting targeting of patriots engaged

[1:59:43.500 --> 1:59:48.980]  propaganda they put out intellectually it's because you can say let's
[1:59:48.980 --> 2:00:00.100]  we're on corruption Alex Jones on the GCM radio network
[2:00:05.140 --> 2:00:12.940]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[2:00:12.940 --> 2:00:20.420]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCM radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[2:00:20.420 --> 2:00:38.180]  Alex Jones Wall Street Journal is reporting us stocks hover near break
[2:00:38.180 --> 2:00:42.820]  even ahead of fed rate decision yelling news conference to follow central
[2:00:42.820 --> 2:00:46.780]  bank policy statement are they set to raise interest rates we'll find out
[2:00:46.780 --> 2:00:52.180]  does it signal the end of the QE unlimited making it hence unlimited no
[2:00:52.180 --> 2:00:58.620]  longer let's go ahead and talk to Jeffrey and Michigan you're talking about your
[2:00:58.620 --> 2:01:03.380]  story dealing with doctors and nurses not going along with the hoax that
[2:01:03.380 --> 2:01:08.300]  vaccines aren't linked to neurological disorders yes the doctors and nurses are
[2:01:08.300 --> 2:01:11.660]  where the tires hit the road and if they start they start posting their videos
[2:01:11.660 --> 2:01:15.300]  about the vaccine injuries that they see and I know they see them because in the
[2:01:15.300 --> 2:01:19.700]  comment section up on info wars right now they're already posting nurses are
[2:01:19.700 --> 2:01:23.540]  already posting saying I do see these vaccine injuries if they start they
[2:01:23.540 --> 2:01:27.340]  admit they're there it's in the in search I mean we've gotten London
[2:01:27.340 --> 2:01:33.020]  telegraph about vaccines killing a bunch of kids in Syria where they forced
[2:01:33.020 --> 2:01:37.860]  inoculated I mean this is like saying we need proof the sun can burn your skin
[2:01:37.860 --> 2:01:43.020]  or we need proof that shooting yourself in the head could hurt I mean but yes we
[2:01:43.020 --> 2:01:47.420]  need the medical experts who have the gravitas to come out and commit the
[2:01:47.420 --> 2:01:52.980]  act of treason and say 2 plus 2 equals 4 if they do that everything else will
[2:01:52.980 --> 2:01:58.580]  follow to quote George Arwell and and then Nuremberg principle number 4 states
[2:01:58.580 --> 2:02:02.380]  that is not acceptable excuse to say I was just following my superior's order
[2:02:02.380 --> 2:02:07.500]  so if this comes out congressman bill poet but Bill Posey apparently has all
[2:02:07.500 --> 2:02:12.780]  types of CDC whistleblower documents and if he decides to go ahead and call a
[2:02:12.780 --> 2:02:16.500]  congressional committee hearing on this and this goes forward the doctors that
[2:02:16.500 --> 2:02:20.340]  are continuing to inject this when this information's out will be subject to that
[2:02:20.340 --> 2:02:24.380]  I totally agree with you and see what's happening is more congressmen and
[2:02:24.380 --> 2:02:28.500]  women their grandsons at their house jumping around at 18 months and the
[2:02:28.500 --> 2:02:32.020]  next week drills for us their life and then they go find out why I don't have a
[2:02:32.020 --> 2:02:36.300]  grandson error because you know he got he got brain damage from you know from

[2:10:49.740 --> 2:10:56.300]  gladiators are going to be like we watch all this violence of football these
[2:10:56.300 --> 2:11:02.100]  guys killing themselves out there most of them die by the age 56 and then it
[2:11:02.100 --> 2:11:06.860]  becomes the ultimate evil in the world when rice punches his wife which i think
[2:11:06.860 --> 2:11:09.860]  it's terrible thing to do i've never had a woman but the point is it's not like
[2:11:09.860 --> 2:11:15.940]  funding i says to kill 300,000 people and our government did that but they can
[2:11:15.940 --> 2:11:19.940]  all point their fingers that senator's chiming in and i was in the gym today
[2:11:19.940 --> 2:11:23.140]  they had espn on they had other channels on they had all the news channels on
[2:11:23.140 --> 2:11:27.900]  like 10 TVs i could see and every channel at once every channel at once
[2:11:27.900 --> 2:11:32.340]  except one had an ad on so nine out of 10 TVs i meant to shoot a video in there
[2:11:32.340 --> 2:11:36.940]  but didn't it's too focused we're doing these workouts are nonstop for an hour
[2:11:36.940 --> 2:11:49.580]  and i looked up and every channel was adrian peterson and ladies and gentlemen
[2:11:49.580 --> 2:11:55.420]  i you can raise your kids however you want but it's not illegal to spank your
[2:11:55.420 --> 2:11:59.500]  children anywhere in the united states it's only illegal to do bottling harm to
[2:11:59.500 --> 2:12:04.700]  them but all over the news and things they say if you yell at your kid it's
[2:12:04.700 --> 2:12:08.860]  illegal and in europe they take your kid away of you yelling at them and then you
[2:12:08.860 --> 2:12:13.260]  are five to seven times more likely in europe and the u.s same number to be
[2:12:13.260 --> 2:12:17.980]  abusing government custody so you're getting out of one fire into another
[2:12:17.980 --> 2:12:22.860]  much more horrible one so we don't even know the details other than he spanked
[2:12:22.860 --> 2:12:28.700]  his son with a switch my dad and my mother were spanked with switches not
[2:12:28.700 --> 2:12:33.820]  very often but my mother would would she was about four came up and kicked my
[2:12:33.820 --> 2:12:40.140]  grandfather in both shins hard when he when when she wanted to stay and play
[2:12:40.140 --> 2:12:43.900]  after church and he said no honey come get in the car
[2:12:43.900 --> 2:12:47.100]  and he took her home and spanked her with a switch she never did again
[2:12:47.100 --> 2:12:50.540]  and i'm sure she had red marks on her my grandfather was just a great loving
[2:12:50.540 --> 2:12:55.020]  christian man that's one way to do it i mean they
[2:12:55.020 --> 2:12:58.860]  have fur seals that will bite the baby fur seal if it keeps going up by the
[2:12:58.860 --> 2:13:02.060]  breathing hole of the killer whale because she knows there's a killer well
[2:13:02.060 --> 2:13:05.740]  there mammals across the board i've seen baby deer come out
[2:13:05.740 --> 2:13:09.180]  and the mom smells hunters not the hunters you're gonna shoot baby deer but
[2:13:09.180 --> 2:13:12.220]  that they don't know that and i've seen them come over and kick them to make
[2:13:12.220 --> 2:13:15.100]  them go back in the woods when you know when the when the fond
[2:13:15.100 --> 2:13:18.140]  doesn't have spots anymore and it's getting a little bit bigger
[2:13:18.140 --> 2:13:23.020]  do they have cps go take the baby deer away do they have cps go take the baby
[2:13:23.020 --> 2:13:27.500]  seals away uh whales are known dolphins are known to
[2:13:27.500 --> 2:13:32.780]  discipline to bite uh that they don't have hands so they'll they'll they'll
[2:13:32.780 --> 2:13:35.820]  nibble look it up marine mammals will will bite their
[2:13:35.820 --> 2:13:38.300]  young if they're going into things that are dangerous
[2:13:38.300 --> 2:13:41.420]  i mean they don't want to bite them well see i'm not endorsing it they're people
[2:13:41.420 --> 2:13:44.620]  that beat their kids it's wrong i don't like it overall
[2:13:44.620 --> 2:13:49.420]  but i mean i i grew up with principles paddling me when i got in fights or got
[2:13:49.420 --> 2:13:53.180]  in trouble and believe me i wanted to be good because it hurt
[2:13:53.180 --> 2:13:56.380]  now even worse was being run around they go you can go run around two miles
[2:13:56.380 --> 2:14:00.300]  around the uh the sports stadium where you can get three pops
[2:14:00.300 --> 2:14:05.580]  and i'd say i want my licks they don't even do pops anymore folks
[2:14:05.580 --> 2:14:09.100]  and look at the discipline in schools has disintegrated
[2:14:09.100 --> 2:14:12.940]  and now they just taser you and you fall over and die
[2:14:12.940 --> 2:14:17.100]  so we're going to taser you because the the the the principle can't spank you
[2:14:17.100 --> 2:14:21.420]  so that's my point uh on the adrian peterson thing is it's all about
[2:14:21.420 --> 2:14:25.340]  the state attacking parenthood and making the ultimate crime spanking your
[2:14:25.340 --> 2:14:27.580]  child
[2:14:27.740 --> 2:14:31.180]  and attacking men and and and making the you know that's a
[2:14:31.180 --> 2:14:34.460]  with a whole country the whole world is shocked that he hasn't been completely
[2:14:34.460 --> 2:14:38.460]  fired and nike's not selling his jerseys and and he's just
[2:14:38.460 --> 2:14:42.860]  uh it's it's ridiculous all right i'm done
[2:14:42.860 --> 2:14:47.500]  john mackavy now joins us mackavy of course was the top
[2:14:47.500 --> 2:14:51.660]  programmer and asks his institute for space studies in new york city
[2:14:51.660 --> 2:14:56.540]  from 68 to 70 from there he went to univac as a software designer
[2:14:56.540 --> 2:14:59.820]  and then later to xerox as an operating systems architect
[2:14:59.820 --> 2:15:04.220]  87 mackaby founded mackavy associates a computer antivirus company
[2:15:04.220 --> 2:15:07.340]  he was the first to distribute antivirus software using the
[2:15:07.340 --> 2:15:11.980]  shareware business model in 89 he quit lockheed
[2:15:11.980 --> 2:15:15.740]  and began working full-time for mackavy associates which he initially operated
[2:15:15.740 --> 2:15:19.100]  from his home in senator california two years after mackavy associates with
[2:15:19.100 --> 2:15:23.420]  public mackavy sold his uh remaining stake in the company
[2:15:23.420 --> 2:15:28.540]  now subsidiary of intel corporation and mackavy's now developed new cutting
[2:15:28.540 --> 2:15:33.500]  edge antivirus anti surveillance systems
[2:15:33.500 --> 2:15:37.180]  and he joins us today as a special website
[2:15:37.180 --> 2:15:42.300]  he wants to talk about uh to send folks for a new campaign to promote liberty
[2:15:42.300 --> 2:15:46.540]  but he can give us the rest of the story he's backtracked
[2:15:46.540 --> 2:15:52.620]  on exactly what is uh happening
[2:15:52.620 --> 2:15:56.540]  with these mystery towers that we know summer homeland security summer fbi
[2:15:56.540 --> 2:16:01.740]  summer private some are stingray but he's paired into the contracts
[2:16:01.740 --> 2:16:04.460]  themselves and discovered something what's amazing is they sit up here like
[2:16:04.460 --> 2:16:08.380]  we're ignorant and go we don't know what these towers are on cbs news the fbi
[2:16:08.380 --> 2:16:12.460]  they must be hackers no we got the documents in seattle other cities
[2:16:12.460 --> 2:16:15.820]  their homeland security they're illegally stealing everything and they have
[2:16:15.820 --> 2:16:19.100]  microphones listening to you and buckley ham and follow the report
[2:16:19.100 --> 2:16:21.500]  but we're going to skip this network breaks we have plenty of time with john
[2:16:21.500 --> 2:16:25.340]  mackavy uh john first off what's the best website of your
[2:16:25.340 --> 2:16:28.540]  of your constellation of sites for folks to go to
[2:16:28.540 --> 2:16:32.060]  with this new campaign to legalize freedom as ron paul says
[2:16:32.060 --> 2:16:35.580]  and and then i want to get into this and then also you've been warning folks
[2:16:35.580 --> 2:16:39.180]  about the cloud i want to get your breakdown on what was kate
[2:16:39.180 --> 2:16:43.420]  upton and all these women thinking putting up their photos their naked
[2:16:43.420 --> 2:16:48.540]  photos their sex vids on a cloud on a far away
[2:16:48.540 --> 2:16:52.860]  server what were they thinking john mackavy
[2:16:52.860 --> 2:16:55.900]  thank you alex is good to be here i'd like to say i'm i'm joining you from the
[2:16:55.900 --> 2:16:59.580]  office of the junkyard in the appalachian mountains of southwest virginia
[2:16:59.580 --> 2:17:04.780]  because the software i'm using to connect you skype is is insecure
[2:17:04.780 --> 2:17:08.380]  and can be tracked to me within a couple of hours and by the time i'm tracked off
[2:17:08.380 --> 2:17:13.340]  i'll be away from here um the the first thing i want to talk about alex is um
[2:17:13.340 --> 2:17:17.260]  two and a half weeks ago it was discovered that there were 17
[2:17:17.260 --> 2:17:21.820]  cells cell towers in the southwest southeast actually that
[2:17:21.820 --> 2:17:25.820]  were fake cell towers uh they were uh rather than
[2:17:25.820 --> 2:17:29.020]  transmitting phone calls directly to who you were talking to they were planting
[2:17:29.020 --> 2:17:33.260]  software on the devices that you were using to connect
[2:17:33.260 --> 2:17:37.020]  in the past two and a half weeks myself and my people tracked down exactly what's
[2:17:37.020 --> 2:17:39.420]  happening and there is only one company that
[2:17:39.420 --> 2:17:43.420]  manufactures this this hardware uh and it's mogul you don't have to
[2:17:43.420 --> 2:17:46.300]  actually put a cell tower beside the road or on top of the mountain you can
[2:17:46.300 --> 2:17:48.860]  put it in the back of your car and put an antenna
[2:17:48.860 --> 2:17:53.420]  on the top of your car and be anywhere and they look and sound exactly like
[2:17:53.420 --> 2:17:56.700]  real cell towers these devices are manufactured by the
[2:17:56.700 --> 2:18:00.940]  harris corporation of in uh in florida near
[2:18:00.940 --> 2:18:04.620]  umbe florida they the only company that manufactures them
[2:18:04.620 --> 2:18:08.060]  and they have a contract with all of their customers saying that
[2:18:08.060 --> 2:18:12.140]  the customer cannot talk about where they bought the equipment from or the
[2:18:12.140 --> 2:18:14.380]  fact that they own this equipment now when i
[2:18:14.380 --> 2:18:17.740]  discovered this i thought that's really strange why would they do that
[2:18:17.740 --> 2:18:20.780]  the only reason i can think of is that there are so many of them
[2:18:20.780 --> 2:18:24.700]  that if the american public knew to the extent that they were being spied on
[2:18:24.700 --> 2:18:28.300]  we would actually you know all get up in arms and do something about it
[2:18:28.300 --> 2:18:31.580]  well i'm trying to do something about it i started a campaign called legalized
[2:18:31.580 --> 2:18:35.100]  freedom uh you can go to legalized freedom
[2:18:35.100 --> 2:18:39.900]  campaign at blogspot.com and read about it what i'm trying to do alex is get
[2:18:39.900 --> 2:18:44.620]  every every uh town in america at least one person who will volunteer
[2:18:44.620 --> 2:18:48.540]  using the freedom of information act to demand to know
[2:18:48.540 --> 2:18:51.900]  what local law enforcement people are using are they using this equipment and
[2:18:51.900 --> 2:18:55.500]  how many do they have i suspect there are hundreds of thousands
[2:18:55.500 --> 2:18:59.820]  of these units here in america their only purpose alex is to spy on us
[2:18:59.820 --> 2:19:03.580]  they will transfer a call as if it's transparent but at the same time they
[2:19:03.580 --> 2:19:07.260]  planned on your device a piece of software which monitors every
[2:19:07.260 --> 2:19:10.860]  single call that you make which reads all of your emails all of your text
[2:19:10.860 --> 2:19:14.220]  messages your contacts and everything that you're doing
[2:19:14.220 --> 2:19:18.300]  they turns on the camera turns on the microphone you are now
[2:19:18.300 --> 2:19:23.260]  watched 24 hours a day now that came out two and a half weeks ago these 17 cell
[2:19:23.260 --> 2:19:27.420]  towers it got some play in the technical press but then it just disappeared
[2:19:27.420 --> 2:19:30.860]  no one checked into it my people and i discovered who it is
[2:19:30.860 --> 2:19:33.660]  the fact that they had these contracts and i do suspect
[2:19:33.660 --> 2:19:37.180]  everywhere in america we have these things which means that all of us are
[2:19:37.180 --> 2:19:40.700]  being spied on constantly else
[2:19:41.420 --> 2:19:45.420]  and of course we then have parallel construction where they use the stolen
[2:19:45.420 --> 2:19:49.660]  data the stolen video audio your whole databases that they
[2:19:49.660 --> 2:19:53.660]  scoop up put put software on your phone to basically control it
[2:19:53.660 --> 2:19:57.340]  they then go lie to judges and don't even tell them where they got the fake
[2:19:57.340 --> 2:20:00.540]  evidence from i mean this is organized racketeering
[2:20:00.540 --> 2:20:04.300]  on the brand is scale ever seen absolutely
[2:20:04.300 --> 2:20:07.980]  and and and basically Harris corporation only sells to
[2:20:07.980 --> 2:20:11.660]  the u.s. government the military covert ins uh uh
[2:20:11.660 --> 2:20:17.500]  agencies the cia local law enforcement and here is where i the problem occurs
[2:20:17.500 --> 2:20:20.700]  alexis once he gets in the hands of local law enforcement you know for a
[2:20:20.700 --> 2:20:24.460]  fact that that no matter what technology you have if enough
[2:20:24.460 --> 2:20:29.500]  official people have access to it the the unofficial the crux the thieves the
[2:20:29.500 --> 2:20:32.860]  gangsters are going to have access to it as well
[2:20:32.860 --> 2:20:36.300]  so not only are we being spied on by our governments by the local police
[2:20:36.300 --> 2:20:41.260]  agencies by the cia by our tax agencies by everyone
[2:20:41.260 --> 2:20:44.220]  it's now getting into the hands of the average criminal
[2:20:44.220 --> 2:20:47.500]  you can buy one of these devices for less than a hundred thousand dollars
[2:20:47.500 --> 2:20:51.100]  install it in your car you don't need much technical technical competence
[2:20:51.100 --> 2:20:54.700]  and you can plan software if you were if you had one of these devices beside a
[2:20:54.700 --> 2:20:59.020]  freeway you could you could infect tens of thousands
[2:20:59.020 --> 2:21:03.660]  of mobile devices every single day and if we have hundreds of thousands of
[2:21:03.660 --> 2:21:07.980]  these devices here in america then none of us have privacy ever
[2:21:07.980 --> 2:21:11.580]  once they can have the the ability to turn on your camera and your microphone
[2:21:11.580 --> 2:21:15.820]  if your daughter has a waterproof phone and she's taking a shower they can watch
[2:21:15.820 --> 2:21:19.580]  if you're talking to a business partner they can hear everything that you say
[2:21:19.580 --> 2:21:23.580]  we have no privacy whatsoever and what i want to do alexis to
[2:21:23.580 --> 2:21:26.700]  to demonstrate the depth that they have gone
[2:21:26.700 --> 2:21:30.540]  if in fact there are thousands of these devices and possibly millions
[2:21:30.540 --> 2:21:33.420]  certainly at some point we'll have to say it's enough
[2:21:33.420 --> 2:21:37.740]  i'm mad as hell am i going to take it anymore or have we gone over the edge
[2:21:37.740 --> 2:21:41.020]  and nobody gives a shit anymore
[2:21:41.820 --> 2:21:46.540]  now people do care john it's just that it seems to be so overwhelming that you
[2:21:46.540 --> 2:21:49.900]  could have an organized program not just with stingray i mean you're
[2:21:49.900 --> 2:21:53.500]  right that's the big thing nationwide but we got documents last year from
[2:21:53.500 --> 2:21:58.300]  inside the government in seattle that caused the national news story
[2:21:58.300 --> 2:22:01.100]  and the city council ordered it turned off of course that never happened
[2:22:01.100 --> 2:22:05.100]  where they put up fake cell towers their own systems microphones camera
[2:22:05.100 --> 2:22:07.980]  systems you name it and we're running it through
[2:22:07.980 --> 2:22:10.540]  homeland security through the local police department
[2:22:10.540 --> 2:22:14.620]  even though it hadn't even been authorized and then again
[2:22:14.620 --> 2:22:18.620]  they're stealing everybody's data using it for prosecutions they can also use it
[2:22:18.620 --> 2:22:21.500]  to plant stuff on phones or computers as you've
[2:22:21.500 --> 2:22:25.180]  pointed out trojan horse people and then they go lie
[2:22:25.180 --> 2:22:30.620]  in the affidavits they go lie to the grand juries and don't even
[2:22:30.620 --> 2:22:33.340]  tell them where the evidence came from i mean this
[2:22:33.340 --> 2:22:37.500]  totally destroys the entire judicial system you can't believe
[2:22:37.500 --> 2:22:42.060]  anything the feds say and now the local departments are getting this
[2:22:42.060 --> 2:22:45.260]  and for folks that don't know let me get by a newsflash
[2:22:45.260 --> 2:22:49.420]  people buy most their drugs from the police in most big cities at least units
[2:22:49.420 --> 2:22:53.980]  of them or or you buy special equipment guns you name it from cops
[2:22:53.980 --> 2:22:58.620]  okay and you know it just it's so much of this stuff continues to come out
[2:22:58.620 --> 2:23:02.460]  and so yes they already do have organized crime with this stuff
[2:23:02.460 --> 2:23:05.820]  they're already are organized crime hacking into people's things this is a
[2:23:05.820 --> 2:23:11.260]  pandora's box they have opened right the purpose the government wants to do one
[2:23:11.260 --> 2:23:13.660]  thing all governments will eventually do the same thing
[2:23:13.660 --> 2:23:18.140]  they want absolute control over the citizenry in ancient times they control
[2:23:18.140 --> 2:23:21.420]  people by keeping them in poverty and giving them entertainment
[2:23:21.420 --> 2:23:26.060]  in in ancient Rome everyone was in poverty but they had the coliseum they
[2:23:26.060 --> 2:23:28.380]  could all go and get entertainment every single day
[2:23:28.380 --> 2:23:31.820]  that's how they control the citizenry today people are controlled through
[2:23:31.820 --> 2:23:35.100]  information if the government knows where every citizen
[2:23:35.100 --> 2:23:39.500]  is at every moment of the day if they know who you're talking to if they know
[2:23:39.500 --> 2:23:43.900]  what you are talking about if they know your dreams your desires if they know
[2:23:43.900 --> 2:23:47.180]  your inner secret life which you devolved to at least some people your
[2:23:47.180 --> 2:23:50.380]  wife your children your mother your father then they control you
[2:23:50.380 --> 2:23:53.740]  and we have reached the point alex where someone can turn a switch
[2:23:53.740 --> 2:23:56.700]  and we have gotten into the world's worst dictatorship
[2:23:56.700 --> 2:23:59.900]  i'm not saying that the one that you know the administration is
[2:23:59.900 --> 2:24:03.340]  has a global plan to do this and they're all secretly talking about it in
[2:24:03.340 --> 2:24:07.260]  behind closed doors but no you know what's coming you know for a fact that
[2:24:07.260 --> 2:24:10.780]  once we are controlled once we have no freedom of
[2:24:10.780 --> 2:24:14.940]  of anything when we when the government knows everything about us
[2:24:14.940 --> 2:24:18.380]  someone's gonna go gee we can use this why don't we just throw that switch and
[2:24:18.380 --> 2:24:22.620]  take what i've interviewed william benny and all the other top nsa people
[2:24:22.620 --> 2:24:25.900]  they say they've been using it for blackmail forever everything you're
[2:24:25.900 --> 2:24:28.380]  saying that it's now going panopticonic
[2:24:28.380 --> 2:24:32.860]  surveilling everything that it was premeditatedly designed for this
[2:24:32.860 --> 2:24:36.540]  and that snowden says they have data that would bring the whole government
[2:24:36.540 --> 2:24:40.140]  down we know it's that the government basically ran 9 11
[2:24:40.140 --> 2:24:43.980]  it's now coming out in the 28 pages with saudi arabia we now know
[2:24:43.980 --> 2:24:47.180]  that it's indeed the government runs the narcotics the snuff films
[2:24:47.180 --> 2:24:51.420]  the little kids everything the organized crime runs the government
[2:24:51.420 --> 2:24:55.820]  at the top and set this up criminally to control the public and take over
[2:24:55.820 --> 2:24:59.340]  everything this is a orchestrated worldwide
[2:24:59.340 --> 2:25:02.940]  takeover i mean look at apple with factories with suicide
[2:25:02.940 --> 2:25:06.460]  nets and literal forced abortions but again they act liberal and talk with a
[2:25:06.460 --> 2:25:10.300]  lisping voice so it's okay i mean these people know what they're
[2:25:10.300 --> 2:25:13.820]  doing john and you have absolutely broke down
[2:25:13.820 --> 2:25:17.500]  how serious it was but william benny called it premeditated
[2:25:17.500 --> 2:25:23.660]  totalitarian total takeover or 1984 on steroids those are all quotes by him
[2:25:23.660 --> 2:25:27.820]  and it is that with complete helicopters and armored vehicles
[2:25:27.820 --> 2:25:32.140]  and checkpoints and forced inoculations and your kids don't belong to you
[2:25:32.140 --> 2:25:35.580]  and neighbors spying on neighbors i mean my god
[2:25:35.580 --> 2:25:39.660]  clergy response teams infraguard spies everywhere
[2:25:39.660 --> 2:25:43.580]  they have done it and now the public is finding out it's all there
[2:25:43.580 --> 2:25:46.940]  before the establishment wanted it known what do you think about the state of
[2:25:46.940 --> 2:25:51.020]  the world and where this is going well i think the problem is alex people are
[2:25:51.020 --> 2:25:54.060]  afraid i mean i'm sitting and talking about i'm in an
[2:25:54.060 --> 2:25:57.740]  office of the junkyard in the middle of nowhere because i'm afraid of people
[2:25:57.740 --> 2:26:02.460]  retaliating um the fox news i gave fox news the
[2:26:02.460 --> 2:26:05.660]  opportunity to break this story they thought that's great until they discovered
[2:26:05.660 --> 2:26:08.220]  that harris corporation was the corporation which
[2:26:08.220 --> 2:26:12.380]  you know has donated more to in fact they used to have their own
[2:26:12.380 --> 2:26:16.140]  television station and they said no you know we will back away from this
[2:26:16.140 --> 2:26:20.620]  people are afraid uh you know i'm afraid really you should be afraid
[2:26:20.620 --> 2:26:24.220]  you know for fact that what i'm saying now and what you're saying now is not
[2:26:24.220 --> 2:26:28.620]  liked by the people in power and and at some point you know maybe
[2:26:28.620 --> 2:26:31.660]  they're going to take some kind of action and worse than an audit you know
[2:26:31.660 --> 2:26:35.340]  because that's the that's the first thing they do they audit you
[2:26:35.340 --> 2:26:39.100]  mercilessly and then maybe you get vague threats you know maybe
[2:26:39.100 --> 2:26:42.460]  maybe people disappear but somebody has to speak out alex that that's the
[2:26:42.460 --> 2:26:46.700]  number one step no one's doing it we are all safe and secure in our
[2:26:46.700 --> 2:26:49.820]  womb we have the technology at our fingertips to i have
[2:26:49.820 --> 2:26:53.740]  pieces delivered whatever we want the world is at our fingertips but we have
[2:26:53.740 --> 2:26:56.700]  no freedom the freedom was taken away by these very
[2:26:56.700 --> 2:26:59.660]  technological devices that we depend on that's right they're going to take the
[2:26:59.660 --> 2:27:03.580]  chicken feed and the bait away there's a piece of cheese out there
[2:27:03.580 --> 2:27:08.220]  on that mouse trap but it's only to lure you in and here's my issue
[2:27:08.220 --> 2:27:11.260]  most people in the government are actually freaked out by this as well
[2:27:11.260 --> 2:27:14.380]  they don't like being brought into this conspiracy this racketeering
[2:27:14.380 --> 2:27:18.060]  they want to get out of it it's not here to keep us safe
[2:27:18.060 --> 2:27:22.380]  our own government's funding al-qaeda that's all coming out funding ices
[2:27:22.380 --> 2:27:26.540]  people are really concerned and they realize the only hope we've got is to
[2:27:26.540 --> 2:27:30.220]  say no to this and stop it we should all be afraid of not doing
[2:27:30.220 --> 2:27:33.420]  what you're doing john going public what ron paul's doing
[2:27:33.420 --> 2:27:37.740]  going public what we're doing what drudge is doing we've all got to speak out
[2:27:37.740 --> 2:27:41.980]  against this because it's crazy well people are saying things alex like
[2:27:41.980 --> 2:27:44.860]  um well it doesn't really matter if they know what i'm doing i'm not doing
[2:27:44.860 --> 2:27:48.060]  anything wrong that attitude is the most
[2:27:48.060 --> 2:27:51.500]  self-destructive attitude i can possibly imagine it doesn't matter if you're
[2:27:51.500 --> 2:27:54.220]  doing something wrong who cares i don't want you in my business
[2:27:54.220 --> 2:27:56.940]  rather than doing something right well john that's like the people that we put
[2:27:56.940 --> 2:28:00.700]  i'm going to uh mexico for christmas for a week and a half
[2:28:00.700 --> 2:28:04.060]  we leave tomorrow and come back such as such look at all the stuff we got at

[2:28:08.220 --> 2:28:11.420]  house it's it's like saying i'll get in a car because i have nothing to fear
[2:28:11.420 --> 2:28:14.780]  it's ted bundy it's not that you're a nice 16 year old girl
[2:28:14.780 --> 2:28:18.220]  so what do you have to fear it's that ted bundy just pulled up
[2:28:18.220 --> 2:28:23.020]  ted bundy okay john wane gasey adolf hitler
[2:28:23.020 --> 2:28:29.180]  joseph stalin jeffrey dommer runs the new world order it's like who cares of
[2:28:29.180 --> 2:28:32.060]  soran's palantir you can see what i'm
[2:28:32.060 --> 2:28:38.460]  having you know uh doing it's soran it's bad a bad guy built this
[2:28:38.460 --> 2:28:41.100]  but someone someone has to take the first step you've been doing it for
[2:28:41.100 --> 2:28:44.540]  years alex i'm getting out here and putting my putting my
[2:28:44.540 --> 2:28:49.180]  my ass on the line here you know i am number one outing a defense contractor

[2:28:51.660 --> 2:28:56.220]  and certainly the largest in the world as far as spying is concerned
[2:28:56.220 --> 2:29:00.460]  developing the hardware and software to spy hopefully on our enemies but it's
[2:29:00.460 --> 2:29:03.740]  actually being used to spy on our citizens ourselves
[2:29:03.740 --> 2:29:08.300]  if someone has to take the first step i'm asking people all across america

[2:33:23.580 --> 2:33:27.500]  i should do an article or a special report about why
[2:33:27.500 --> 2:33:32.860]  surveillance kills productivity freedom you name it you have predatory mega
[2:33:32.860 --> 2:33:37.660]  corporations that are making money off the militarization of the west
[2:33:37.660 --> 2:33:41.420]  off armored vehicles drones helicopters surveillance
[2:33:41.420 --> 2:33:45.900]  the uniforms the weapons the equipment
[2:33:45.900 --> 2:33:51.260]  and the substations are turning into their own little nsa spy bases
[2:33:51.260 --> 2:33:55.340]  and so they're expanding all these petty crimes and bureaucratic things
[2:33:55.340 --> 2:33:58.780]  watering on the wrong day and two thousand dollar four thousand
[2:33:58.780 --> 2:34:03.100]  dollar a day fines for dust in your barn and they're going to use all of this
[2:34:03.100 --> 2:34:06.860]  surveillance to literally hammer everyone to hell
[2:34:06.860 --> 2:34:10.780]  while the government ships in the narcotics and uses a surveillance to
[2:34:10.780 --> 2:34:14.540]  cut out their competition to make sure the big banks make the highest profits
[2:34:14.540 --> 2:34:19.020]  just like goldman sacks has been caught using high frequency trading to corner
[2:34:19.020 --> 2:34:24.060]  the stock market it's rigged they're rigging it
[2:34:24.060 --> 2:34:28.300]  but the stock market's pumped up with a bunch of fiat dollars right now
[2:34:28.300 --> 2:34:31.500]  inflationary dollars so people don't know that and think oh it's doing well
[2:34:31.500 --> 2:34:34.300]  overall and when the house of cards comes down
[2:34:34.300 --> 2:34:38.220]  all that's going to be left is the police state and it's not there to keep
[2:34:38.220 --> 2:34:41.660]  us safe and again the media acts like we talk
[2:34:41.660 --> 2:34:43.580]  about a police state we're talking about average cops
[2:34:43.580 --> 2:34:47.100]  the average cop is just out revenue generating or is out responding to petty
[2:34:47.100 --> 2:34:50.620]  crime i'm talking about the police state like in
[2:34:50.620 --> 2:34:55.980]  north korea on steroids as william benning called it
[2:34:55.980 --> 2:35:01.660]  former director of major operations and technology for the national security
[2:35:01.660 --> 2:35:05.980]  agency it is a predatory takeover john macAfee is our
[2:35:05.980 --> 2:35:09.580]  guest but they can corner markets amazon
[2:35:09.580 --> 2:35:13.740]  now has a program as of this year where with their longtime customers they
[2:35:13.740 --> 2:35:16.620]  already have packaged and are beginning to ship
[2:35:16.620 --> 2:35:23.500]  with they say 99.9 accuracy the package that you want
[2:35:23.500 --> 2:35:28.060]  before you order it and then they even have it where
[2:35:28.060 --> 2:35:31.180]  if it's being shipped and you don't order it by time it turns back around and
[2:35:31.180 --> 2:35:34.220]  comes back but the error level is so low
[2:35:34.220 --> 2:35:37.580]  they make all this money out of it
[2:35:38.780 --> 2:35:41.580]  you go on amazon and you've already ordered a toaster off there my buddy was
[2:35:41.580 --> 2:35:45.020]  talking about it and he wanted another toaster
[2:35:45.020 --> 2:35:49.340]  for his farmhouse or whatever he was his farmhouse and it said don't you
[2:35:49.340 --> 2:35:52.860]  sure you want this in your cart you already got a toaster a month ago
[2:35:52.860 --> 2:35:55.740]  and you're like well that's that's convenient it's easy for me no it's
[2:35:55.740 --> 2:35:59.020]  profiling you and now they can corner whole
[2:35:59.020 --> 2:36:02.380]  markets they can decide what propaganda to put out and then look at how it's
[2:36:02.380 --> 2:36:06.940]  being effective and then change it it's it's superman technology for
[2:36:06.940 --> 2:36:11.260]  tyrants to dominate humanity and to change our free will
[2:36:11.260 --> 2:36:15.340]  and john mackavy the famous hanny virus software guru
[2:36:15.340 --> 2:36:20.700]  who evaded the now proven corrupt officials connected into terrorism down
[2:36:20.700 --> 2:36:25.500]  in baleese joins us and i'm kind of ranting here today
[2:36:25.500 --> 2:36:29.420]  about what you're discussing tracking back the contract i knew stingray was
[2:36:29.420 --> 2:36:33.100]  one of the units that's being bought with harris communications and the rest
[2:36:33.100 --> 2:36:36.780]  of it but i didn't know that it's in the contract they
[2:36:36.780 --> 2:36:41.180]  can't reveal it but but isn't that funny it's like
[2:36:41.180 --> 2:36:43.980]  monsanto saying it's in the contract you can't reveal that
[2:36:43.980 --> 2:36:47.900]  this killed monkeys it was glyphosate was tested on her it's in the contract
[2:36:47.900 --> 2:36:53.020]  that and so there's cops and fbi on news going we don't know who these are
[2:36:53.020 --> 2:36:57.260]  must be hackers then they just walk off like they would leave a hackers
[2:36:57.260 --> 2:37:01.580]  fake telephone pole up that looks like a cactus i mean this is how
[2:37:01.580 --> 2:37:05.180]  dumb they think we are then we even get the documents they're doing it
[2:37:05.180 --> 2:37:09.340]  and now they're adding john as you know microphones that listen to people
[2:37:09.340 --> 2:37:13.260]  and now they're adding face scanning cameras i mean there's no into it where
[2:37:13.260 --> 2:37:17.580]  the government literally is engaging in felony activities
[2:37:17.580 --> 2:37:21.820]  and lying to us what happens if they don't get in trouble john
[2:37:21.820 --> 2:37:26.140]  well they they conveniently sign his contracts because it gives them an out
[2:37:26.140 --> 2:37:29.100]  yeah well they can't talk about it we can't say we have them because we're
[2:37:29.100 --> 2:37:32.140]  legally bound not to talk about it
[2:37:32.140 --> 2:37:36.540]  by the way that long claims of i need so that i started smoking alex when the
[2:37:36.540 --> 2:37:41.820]  anti smoking laws became so draconian like that i just couldn't not smoke i
[2:37:41.820 --> 2:37:44.380]  felt sorry for these tiny crowds of people
[2:37:44.380 --> 2:37:47.980]  huddled together in these these 10 by 10 areas trying to smoke so
[2:37:47.980 --> 2:37:51.820]  i started smoking so you're you're a contrarian not just a rebel
[2:37:51.820 --> 2:37:55.900]  well yeah absolutely i mean you know at some point even if you disagree with
[2:37:55.900 --> 2:37:59.500]  what's happened with what a person is doing you've got to do something to stand
[2:37:59.500 --> 2:38:02.460]  up for their rights to do it in fact i formed a
[2:38:02.460 --> 2:38:06.460]  society called the social pariahs you were on twitter we're on facebook you can
[2:38:06.460 --> 2:38:09.500]  check us out where we're supporting people who do these
[2:38:09.500 --> 2:38:14.460]  these things which are socially undesirable or not politically correct
[2:38:14.460 --> 2:38:18.220]  because yeah i don't care i literally started smoking when i was at an airport
[2:38:18.220 --> 2:38:20.860]  in atlanta i saw these four people out in the cold
[2:38:20.860 --> 2:38:25.020]  huddled together uh you know desperately trying to get their last
[2:38:25.020 --> 2:38:28.220]  spot i thought you know this is it i'm gonna start smoking right here right
[2:38:28.220 --> 2:38:31.900]  now today and i did um so in fact you i think you
[2:38:31.900 --> 2:38:35.340]  kindly enough let me smoke in your office one time when we're on the air and i
[2:38:35.340 --> 2:38:39.100]  know that you you had quit smoking so i i apologize to that but that was very
[2:38:39.100 --> 2:38:42.540]  gracious of you sir well i've never been a huge smoker but cigars and stuff i've
[2:38:42.540 --> 2:38:45.980]  just teetotaled it uh the whole nine yards but we do like to
[2:38:45.980 --> 2:38:48.620]  we do like to violate the city ordinance on indoor smoking so we're
[2:38:48.620 --> 2:38:51.340]  happy to have that happy to have that happen
[2:38:51.340 --> 2:38:55.340]  with the nanny state who's deadly fluoride or water and doesn't let us opt out
[2:38:55.340 --> 2:38:59.020]  of it uh but uh john getting serious here
[2:38:59.020 --> 2:39:02.860]  uh what about the cloud i mean i remember
[2:39:02.860 --> 2:39:06.220]  knowing now it doesn't let me store my photos on my phone
[2:39:06.220 --> 2:39:09.900]  or whatever uh it sends it off to this big central hub
[2:39:09.900 --> 2:39:13.660]  and they admit that google all of them data mine the
[2:39:13.660 --> 2:39:18.140]  the emails data mine the photos shell the info in aggregates to the government
[2:39:18.140 --> 2:39:21.580]  it's not just the nsa it's these big corporations are literally making
[2:39:21.580 --> 2:39:24.460]  billions a year that's why police are going
[2:39:24.460 --> 2:39:29.020]  to their own cell phone towers and saying why should we pay for the data
[2:39:29.020 --> 2:39:33.500]  without a warrant from the telecoms absolutely and no no
[2:39:33.500 --> 2:39:37.340]  and then the telecoms of course would not let you get their executives info
[2:39:37.340 --> 2:39:41.660]  the cops want everybody's info so there's like a race a surveillance race
[2:39:41.660 --> 2:39:46.220]  going on well why do you think the cloud is free think about it it costs us
[2:39:46.220 --> 2:39:49.820]  nothing to store as much information as we want
[2:39:49.820 --> 2:39:53.900]  well there's got to be a reason because someone's putting the bill for this
[2:39:53.900 --> 2:39:57.180]  and the people want the information in the cloud because believe it or not the
[2:39:57.180 --> 2:40:01.580]  cloud is not something which is which is uh uh inaccessible
[2:40:01.580 --> 2:40:04.460]  anybody can get into it anybody can do anything they want so all the
[2:40:04.460 --> 2:40:07.900]  information that you're putting there is available and will stay available i mean
[2:40:07.900 --> 2:40:12.380]  to save data is is it costs nothing i mean this little device here this little
[2:40:12.380 --> 2:40:17.020]  hello kitty thing for kids you can store over 10 000 king james
[2:40:17.020 --> 2:40:19.820]  versions of the bible on this one little thing
[2:40:19.820 --> 2:40:25.660]  got the usb connection here five dollars uh so of course everything that we say
[2:40:25.660 --> 2:40:29.180]  everything that we do all of our videos all of our images all of our written
[2:40:29.180 --> 2:40:33.180]  words are going to be saved now in perpetuity nothing will ever
[2:40:33.180 --> 2:40:36.300]  disappear and you can go back into a thousand years
[2:40:36.300 --> 2:40:39.980]  now and rehash this conversation and listen to every single word because
[2:40:39.980 --> 2:40:44.860]  saving it costs nothing it costs nothing our technology becomes so
[2:40:44.860 --> 2:40:48.540]  sophisticated and our engineering so precise that
[2:40:48.540 --> 2:40:51.900]  it doesn't cost anything to save anything anymore so the cloud
[2:40:51.900 --> 2:40:55.180]  we put all of our data there because it's convenient because i can
[2:40:55.180 --> 2:40:58.620]  put it in the cloud and i can access it from another computer from another
[2:40:58.620 --> 2:41:03.820]  state anytime that i want well unfortunately elix so can anybody else
[2:41:03.820 --> 2:41:08.140]  well that's like the smart houses on record the cia director said
[2:41:08.140 --> 2:41:11.900]  everything has spy devices in it and we're going to control your life with it
[2:41:11.900 --> 2:41:15.260]  and you see these ads where you're in hawaii on the boat and your house is
[2:41:15.260 --> 2:41:19.980]  having a fire and you know or you can change the air condition at your house
[2:41:19.980 --> 2:41:23.580]  the issue is now the globalists can all go through that device
[2:41:23.580 --> 2:41:28.540]  and also know what's going on in your house as a tool of social control
[2:41:28.540 --> 2:41:31.820]  it is a total revolution against privacy i want to give you a quote
[2:41:31.820 --> 2:41:37.100]  from 1978 by philip k dick who wrote blade runner
[2:41:37.100 --> 2:41:41.100]  and of course uh scanner darkly and so many other powerful books that have been
[2:41:41.100 --> 2:41:44.700]  made into films one which film i'm honored enough to be in
[2:41:44.700 --> 2:41:49.660]  scanner darkly there will come a time this is a quote from philip k dick
[2:41:49.660 --> 2:41:55.820]  there will come a time when it isn't they're spying on me through my phone
[2:41:55.820 --> 2:42:01.740]  anymore eventually it will be my phone is spying on me what a visionary
[2:42:01.740 --> 2:42:05.100]  that's exactly what's happening and by the way philip k dick is is my favorite
[2:42:05.100 --> 2:42:08.540]  author and my my favorite film of his is blade runner
[2:42:08.540 --> 2:42:12.460]  which is actually a based on a book of his called do androids dream of
[2:42:12.460 --> 2:42:15.580]  electric she is electric she yeah he was a visionary
[2:42:15.580 --> 2:42:19.500]  and he was absolutely correct and it is what's happening this device
[2:42:19.500 --> 2:42:22.460]  they're not spying on me through this device this device is spying on me it has
[2:42:22.460 --> 2:42:26.460]  its own intelligence its own chip it's a computer it's an intelligent
[2:42:26.460 --> 2:42:32.460]  gadget that watches listens to me reads my emails my sms messages my contacts
[2:42:32.460 --> 2:42:37.340]  monitors my activities this device which each of us carry and we want to carry
[2:42:37.340 --> 2:42:41.980]  and we're glad to carry is spying on us elix and
[2:42:41.980 --> 2:42:45.420]  just like the the gift that the trojans gave
[2:42:45.420 --> 2:42:49.580]  was beautiful indeed it has a lot of legitimate devices and things on their
[2:42:49.580 --> 2:42:54.460]  very useful tools and humans love tools the problem is it's been loaded
[2:42:54.460 --> 2:42:58.460]  in mill gates his own words and others to where it is meant to dominate our
[2:42:58.460 --> 2:43:02.780]  lives be the center of our lives and condition us track us
[2:43:02.780 --> 2:43:08.140]  control us as not our guardian angel but our little guardian devil
[2:43:08.140 --> 2:43:11.660]  it's literally a palantir through which sauron
[2:43:11.660 --> 2:43:16.140]  can stand right next to us every day and watch everything we do
[2:43:16.140 --> 2:43:20.540]  and if you don't put in an airplane mode when you're not using it
[2:43:20.540 --> 2:43:25.660]  it's there radiating you and even cbs news admits doctors are saying medical
[2:43:25.660 --> 2:43:30.540]  doctors turn them off when you're not using them
[2:43:30.540 --> 2:43:33.900]  i take my battery out when i'm not using for just for safety sake
[2:43:33.900 --> 2:43:37.260]  but yeah but the most insidious thing alex is not not just that
[2:43:37.260 --> 2:43:41.660]  that it's doing this but that we like it we like this device we were in love
[2:43:41.660 --> 2:43:45.340]  with this device we can't imagine going from home without it
[2:43:45.340 --> 2:43:48.940]  when we're without it we feel insecure oh my god where's my phone
[2:43:48.940 --> 2:43:53.980]  so that's the most insidious thing the thing which is which is our worst enemy
[2:43:53.980 --> 2:43:58.700]  we love the most you know we're living we're living in a science fiction movie
[2:43:58.700 --> 2:44:01.980]  where there's these smart devices rolled out by a central government that's
[2:44:01.980 --> 2:44:04.620]  already replacing front line trips with battle droids
[2:44:04.620 --> 2:44:08.460]  in south korea on the dmc almost all the aircraft have already gone autonomous
[2:44:08.460 --> 2:44:12.140]  drone skynet is now deciding when to launch the missiles
[2:44:12.140 --> 2:44:15.820]  they are openly attacking humans getting rid of our jobs the major foxcom
[2:44:15.820 --> 2:44:19.020]  factories are going total human free we're being social
[2:44:19.020 --> 2:44:22.380]  engineers with the food and water and when we have these little devices
[2:44:22.380 --> 2:44:26.700]  tailored to have everything about us on them and tracking us
[2:44:26.700 --> 2:44:31.500]  and the government is illegally accessing all of it so are the corporations
[2:44:31.500 --> 2:44:36.460]  and it's all premeditated where does it go next
[2:44:36.460 --> 2:44:41.100]  that's anybody's guess i mean it it will go where the person in power wants it
[2:44:41.100 --> 2:44:44.620]  to go as always and it will never go in a positive
[2:44:44.620 --> 2:44:49.260]  direction once we once society reaches such a level of decadence where we
[2:44:49.260 --> 2:44:52.700]  have these these things because they make life easy for us
[2:44:52.700 --> 2:44:56.460]  they make life convenient for us nobody wants to do hard work no
[2:44:56.460 --> 2:45:01.260]  no one wants to to live any what not one second in discomfort
[2:45:01.260 --> 2:45:05.500]  so um it who knows where it's going it will go
[2:45:05.500 --> 2:45:10.860]  where it goes always downhill and downhill until total total collapse
[2:45:10.860 --> 2:45:13.660]  comes and this is issue and this is why i've done the
[2:45:13.660 --> 2:45:17.980]  legalized freedom campaign please legalized freedom at block spot dot
[2:45:17.980 --> 2:45:22.380]  legalized freedom campaign at block spot block spot dot com
[2:45:22.380 --> 2:45:25.980]  give us some help volunteer to do this thing i'm talking to people out here
[2:45:25.980 --> 2:45:29.100]  now alexa volunteer to to use the freedom of information
[2:45:29.100 --> 2:45:33.260]  act to find out exactly how much buying is done in your town and let us know so
[2:45:33.260 --> 2:45:37.420]  that we can correlate this and put it out help us out financially if you can
[2:45:37.420 --> 2:45:42.940]  send us whatever you can to legalized freedom at peobock 60 finger
[2:45:42.940 --> 2:45:48.300]  tenancy three three four is it three eight three three four yeah three three
[2:45:48.300 --> 2:45:51.980]  four look and and people don't want to do it for years i i think they should
[2:45:51.980 --> 2:45:55.340]  should be their own citizen journalists mainstream media should be
[2:45:55.340 --> 2:45:58.540]  shamed into covering this i want to explain again
[2:45:58.540 --> 2:46:03.100]  the police the feds they already go in bulk data dumps
[2:46:03.100 --> 2:46:07.020]  and they can get basically anything they want from the telecoms but the telecoms
[2:46:07.020 --> 2:46:09.820]  because they know they can get sued have cut back on this um
[2:46:09.820 --> 2:46:13.420]  the last few years and make them get warrants and so the feds don't like to
[2:46:13.420 --> 2:46:17.260]  share too much with local police with the parallel construction because it's so
[2:46:17.260 --> 2:46:21.020]  illegal and so now the locals with
[2:46:21.020 --> 2:46:23.740]  homeland security grants because they both share the data
[2:46:23.740 --> 2:46:28.220]  are putting in in every city in town their own cell towers people call them
[2:46:28.220 --> 2:46:33.820]  fake they're not fake they're dual cell towers to steal your data
[2:46:33.820 --> 2:46:38.460]  to put out the codes to be able to put programs on your phone
[2:46:38.460 --> 2:46:41.740]  to take control of it and remember what happened five years ago
[2:46:41.740 --> 2:46:47.020]  in philadelphia and in surrounding areas that also happened in sacramento
[2:46:47.020 --> 2:46:50.540]  the the 11 year old girl was getting in and out of the shower
[2:46:50.540 --> 2:46:55.100]  she was eating skittles and the school called her in and said you were taking
[2:46:55.100 --> 2:46:58.860]  drugs were suspending you and they said how did you know and they said your
[2:46:58.860 --> 2:47:02.620]  laptop and we have videos of the teachers bragging yeah
[2:47:02.620 --> 2:47:06.300]  we see the kids at home we see them undressing blah blah blah so over the
[2:47:06.300 --> 2:47:09.420]  top if you caught a teacher peeping tomming through your window
[2:47:09.420 --> 2:47:12.620]  you could beat him to death and the grand jury would no bill you
[2:47:12.620 --> 2:47:16.620]  you could kill someone in manslaughter in an active anger
[2:47:16.620 --> 2:47:20.780]  if that happened but but but in the webcam gate
[2:47:20.780 --> 2:47:25.180]  the the the court even ruled that well you know what
[2:47:25.180 --> 2:47:28.300]  you got to pay six hundred and ten thousand dollars but the school said
[2:47:28.300 --> 2:47:31.980]  we're not going to stop and it's ubiquitous and they were using
[2:47:31.980 --> 2:47:39.260]  the cell cams and the the the the laptops that to watch everyone
[2:47:39.260 --> 2:47:42.540]  this is what goes on and they weren't even apologetic
[2:47:42.540 --> 2:47:47.900]  first time i heard of this john mackavy was about 14 years ago in tennessee
[2:47:47.900 --> 2:47:53.100]  and then in missouri it was in local news in both cases in one case in missouri
[2:47:53.100 --> 2:47:57.180]  the middle school girls basketball team came
[2:47:57.180 --> 2:48:01.420]  to another town and they were in the showers and saw cameras in the showers
[2:48:01.420 --> 2:48:05.900]  now the normal response would be run out screaming to your parents panic
[2:48:05.900 --> 2:48:10.060]  but in but in the 1984 the school came out and said what's the big deal of
[2:48:10.060 --> 2:48:12.940]  course there could be fights in the showers or thefts
[2:48:12.940 --> 2:48:16.460]  and it turned out it was being accessed by people
[2:48:16.460 --> 2:48:21.100]  in more than 20 states and by hundreds of law enforcement departments
[2:48:21.100 --> 2:48:26.540]  filled with pedophiles wanting to watch prepubescent girls in the shower
[2:48:26.540 --> 2:48:31.020]  okay and i mean folks this is a this is a total network
[2:48:31.020 --> 2:48:33.980]  and it came out the nsa they're looking at people and watching people over
[2:48:33.980 --> 2:48:37.980]  webcams and stalking people and of course if you're kate upton
[2:48:37.980 --> 2:48:41.100]  don't you know there's going to be people at the nsa they're going to want to
[2:48:41.100 --> 2:48:43.180]  get into your cloud and look at your naked body
[2:48:43.180 --> 2:48:47.740]  i mean how stupid are people john mackavy how dumb are we
[2:48:47.740 --> 2:48:51.580]  that it's just that that how dare you not like a shower in the 11 year old
[2:48:51.580 --> 2:48:56.140]  girl's bathroom i mean how dare you not like cameras in there
[2:48:56.140 --> 2:48:59.820]  admittedly we as a society may not be the smartest in the world but seriously
[2:48:59.820 --> 2:49:03.740]  else where are the parents if you're a father of a teenage girl
[2:49:03.740 --> 2:49:07.660]  and you find out that someone is watching her in the shower
[2:49:07.660 --> 2:49:11.900]  good god elix why aren't we all out in the streets carrying signs and guns
[2:49:11.900 --> 2:49:15.340]  making sure this never happens again they did and the cops showed up and said
[2:49:15.340 --> 2:49:17.500]  it's no big deal and the people at that school
[2:49:17.500 --> 2:49:21.500]  argued with the other parents and said it keeps them safe
[2:49:21.500 --> 2:49:25.900]  well yeah okay maybe but it's the government if a private citizen did it
[2:49:25.900 --> 2:49:28.860]  you freak out because it's government it's supposedly safe
[2:49:28.860 --> 2:49:33.900]  the founders tell us in history shows government's the most dangerous go ahead
[2:49:33.900 --> 2:49:36.860]  well governments are composed up of individuals elix that's the issue they're
[2:49:36.860 --> 2:49:39.820]  all people uh it's just like the bank of america they can
[2:49:39.820 --> 2:49:43.420]  they have the the the right to watch you while you're you're accessing your
[2:49:43.420 --> 2:49:46.620]  account but what is the bank of america it's composed of people someone at a
[2:49:46.620 --> 2:49:50.140]  lunch hour who works with the bank of america who is bored going let's go
[2:49:50.140 --> 2:49:53.580]  watch this teenage girl take a shower come on get real
[2:49:53.580 --> 2:49:58.060]  if if it happened to my child i had a 14 year old child or a 12 year old child
[2:49:58.060 --> 2:50:01.820]  found out that someone was watching her while she was in my house
[2:50:01.820 --> 2:50:05.580]  in the privacy of the bathroom taking a shower i would pick up a gun
[2:50:05.580 --> 2:50:08.460]  why aren't we all doing that what is wrong with us what is wrong with the
[2:50:08.460 --> 2:50:12.540]  parents have you lost all respect for yourself
[2:50:12.540 --> 2:50:15.900]  it's just what i'm telling you our national symbol should be a guy bending
[2:50:15.900 --> 2:50:18.860]  over grabbing his ankles
[2:50:19.180 --> 2:50:21.820]  unfortunately it really we've it's reached that state ox
[2:50:21.820 --> 2:50:25.100]  i'm starting to lose faith not not not in the future but
[2:50:25.100 --> 2:50:28.700]  but in ourselves as a society what has happened to us
[2:50:28.700 --> 2:50:33.020]  in 1950 do you realize what would have happened if someone said yeah they're
[2:50:33.020 --> 2:50:36.460]  watching your kids in the shower they would have burned the school down and
[2:50:36.460 --> 2:50:40.140]  hung the teachers you know this is a fact no what happens
[2:50:40.140 --> 2:50:43.420]  nothing we sit back and turn on the television and watch the next football

[2:55:22.620 --> 2:55:26.380]  they have designed the architecture of this to be tapped to be tracked in
[2:55:26.380 --> 2:55:29.740]  live time for social engineering that's admitted
[2:55:29.740 --> 2:55:33.500]  but at the same time the internet's been exposing the establishment a lot as
[2:55:33.500 --> 2:55:35.660]  well
[2:55:35.660 --> 2:55:39.340]  i don't even know if humanity can survive all the stuff that's going to come
[2:55:39.340 --> 2:55:42.140]  out of this i mean we definitely are strapped
[2:55:42.140 --> 2:55:46.780]  into a serious roller coaster here big time big time
[2:55:46.780 --> 2:55:50.380]  and it is a double edged sword while the internet the cloud that our new
[2:55:50.380 --> 2:55:54.300]  technology is being used to spy on us and to remove our freedoms
[2:55:54.300 --> 2:55:58.140]  is also alex giving us the opportunity to express ourselves
[2:55:58.140 --> 2:56:02.620]  and to utilize the few freedoms we have left i'd like to say this before i
[2:56:02.620 --> 2:56:06.140]  forget it we we spoke about parents not caring whether
[2:56:06.140 --> 2:56:10.540]  their children are being watched surely as parents
[2:56:10.540 --> 2:56:14.620]  as as loving human beings you must care about the world
[2:56:14.620 --> 2:56:19.260]  that you are leaving to your children your children have to live in this world
[2:56:19.260 --> 2:56:25.020]  that is increasingly constrained increasingly less free a world where
[2:56:25.020 --> 2:56:27.740]  privacy is diminishing to the point that it is
[2:56:27.740 --> 2:56:32.700]  disappearing if you love your children for christ sake do something
[2:56:32.700 --> 2:56:37.180]  do something i just have to say this alex i i feel like i'm alone up here on
[2:56:37.180 --> 2:56:39.820]  a soapbox and people are looking the other way
[2:56:39.820 --> 2:56:43.660]  uh it's no they're not listen people are really concerned they're really awake
[2:56:43.660 --> 2:56:47.180]  now uh but it is maker to break it because we
[2:56:47.180 --> 2:56:50.620]  either now start reversing this and people start getting in trouble
[2:56:50.620 --> 2:56:53.900]  or we've set the precedent that we live in the opposite
[2:56:53.900 --> 2:56:59.100]  of an unsurveilled society and it's not to keep us safe go ahead
[2:56:59.100 --> 2:57:03.820]  it's not just the the lack of privacy in fact that we have surveillance
[2:57:03.820 --> 2:57:09.580]  we sit back blindly while police kill innocent children uh and and get away
[2:57:09.580 --> 2:57:13.340]  with it and and it this is gotta stop alex
[2:57:13.340 --> 2:57:19.820]  if we have any sense of of humanity if we have a grain of grace left surely
[2:57:19.820 --> 2:57:23.340]  if we don't go government across the board is becoming more and more unaccountable
[2:57:23.340 --> 2:57:27.820]  but if you look at the the feds militarizing police
[2:57:27.820 --> 2:57:31.180]  and then using the bad actions of the police to federalize them further
[2:57:31.180 --> 2:57:34.700]  or if you look at how they now admit all over the country they pull you over and
[2:57:34.700 --> 2:57:37.820]  you got cash no drugs they take your cash
[2:57:37.820 --> 2:57:41.020]  when cops became robbers was one headline i saw this week
[2:57:41.020 --> 2:57:45.580]  people are really starting to understand that as well how far we've fallen
[2:57:45.580 --> 2:57:49.500]  we have we have uh and i have a friend who was traveling through to texas with
[2:57:49.500 --> 2:57:53.260]  a fair amount of cash well legal cash i mean you work for money you take money
[2:57:53.260 --> 2:57:58.220]  put in your pocket um and and and they charged this person with
[2:57:58.220 --> 2:58:01.900]  uh my laundering for christ sex because it was cash
[2:58:01.900 --> 2:58:05.500]  at least they charged him in most the cases they don't even come up with a
[2:58:05.500 --> 2:58:09.660]  fake charge they just take the money right
[2:58:09.660 --> 2:58:13.420]  this is the world we're living in and you and i are talking about it like
[2:58:13.420 --> 2:58:16.540]  uh and people are listening like yeah okay that happens and then you turn a
[2:58:16.540 --> 2:58:19.260]  tp back on us and get lost in some fake world
[2:58:19.260 --> 2:58:22.540]  that's because they've raised us as spectators and even as horrible things
[2:58:22.540 --> 2:58:25.500]  are happening even to ourselves we just sit back and watch it
[2:58:25.500 --> 2:58:29.980]  we're not actors in the real world that's what carl rove said he said we're
[2:58:29.980 --> 2:58:35.100]  history's actors now in the elite you'll accept whatever reality we say

[3:01:44.700 --> 3:01:48.220]  ashley in texas you're on the air i'm sorry go ahead
[3:01:48.220 --> 3:01:53.740]  hi alex i have a few things um one of them i do i definitely agree with you
[3:01:53.740 --> 3:01:56.940]  about the Ebola i think they're going to be incubating the troops and then
[3:01:56.940 --> 3:02:01.340]  bringing them back um and i grew up in Panama in
[3:02:01.340 --> 3:02:05.740]  central america um before we went we got yellow fever shot
[3:02:05.740 --> 3:02:11.420]  malaria tetanus um i don't really know that there was anything
[3:02:11.420 --> 3:02:16.780]  in those vaccinations then but um the americans that i went to school with and
[3:02:16.780 --> 3:02:20.140]  all of us that were there we were actually really healthy
[3:02:20.140 --> 3:02:23.820]  um so i don't know if it was just because we were picking fruit off the
[3:02:23.820 --> 3:02:27.020]  trees and and playing outside a lot and i don't know
[3:02:27.020 --> 3:02:31.420]  um and i have also taken my kids out of school i'm home schooling them now
[3:02:31.420 --> 3:02:34.700]  because i you know i want to be ready to take off and get out of the city
[3:02:34.700 --> 3:02:38.060]  to the point where i'm even buying a four by four so i can go off road if i have
[3:02:38.060 --> 3:02:43.020]  to to get around the traffic yeah and um and
[3:02:43.020 --> 3:02:46.780]  well another thing about the the racist um my
[3:02:46.780 --> 3:02:50.380]  my daughter when she was six uh was playing at the playground
[3:02:50.380 --> 3:02:54.540]  and a young little mexican boy started hitting her
[3:02:54.540 --> 3:02:58.300]  so i went over i said you know you can't hit other people and he said you're a
[3:02:58.300 --> 3:03:02.140]  racist yes so i don't know that that's the new
[3:03:02.140 --> 3:03:05.740]  thing if you give me your money give me your life let me tax you give me your
[3:03:05.740 --> 3:03:08.780]  guns or you're racist it's like a power word people will go
[3:03:08.780 --> 3:03:12.780]  racist and they stand back like uh i just waved a man and we're going
[3:03:12.780 --> 3:03:17.340]  oh no but it actually works and then people just fall to their knees they'll
[3:03:17.340 --> 3:03:19.980]  do whatever they're told just don't call me that
[3:03:19.980 --> 3:03:23.660]  yeah they do well i i just leaned down right in front of my daughter in front
[3:03:23.660 --> 3:03:27.500]  of that boy and i said sweetheart this is a boy who is not being raised right
[3:03:27.500 --> 3:03:31.660]  and we don't hang out with those people well you're bad i mean you should
[3:03:31.660 --> 3:03:35.260]  throw your child into a pit of piranhas okay just to prove that you're not
[3:03:35.260 --> 3:03:38.300]  against piranhas but yeah no that's the new
[3:03:38.300 --> 3:03:42.380]  the new thing because now america is majority minority
[3:03:42.380 --> 3:03:45.820]  and so the the democrats of the party of the klan was always race-based
[3:03:45.820 --> 3:03:49.260]  when whites wouldn't go along with that they flipped against the republicans
[3:03:49.260 --> 3:03:52.780]  that have been against it and said oh they're the races we're now
[3:03:52.780 --> 3:03:56.140]  the party of stopping racism and so it only gets worse because they run the
[3:03:56.140 --> 3:03:59.820]  whole deal they're expert race pimps and they've done a great job the country
[3:03:59.820 --> 3:04:03.420]  is completely fried i appreciate your call look i'm sorry to
