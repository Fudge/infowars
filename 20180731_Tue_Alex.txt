[00:00.000 --> 00:29.560]  you know there aren't enough hours in the day for me to even read
[00:29.560 --> 00:35.600]  10% of the disinfo news articles that are being put out against yours truly
[00:35.600 --> 00:40.720]  right now and again that's being done to set the precedent the platform all
[00:40.720 --> 00:44.800]  Christians all conservatives all nationalists all patriots
[00:44.800 --> 00:48.240]  conservatives and libertarians and everybody running for Congress and
[00:48.240 --> 00:54.720]  folks that are already in Congress they're already discovering that they've
[00:54.720 --> 00:59.040]  been completely shadow banned not just four members of Congress like
[00:59.040 --> 01:04.280]  Congressman Gates said trying to single himself out that sounds special he's a
[01:04.280 --> 01:10.720]  buffoon till he wakes up he got the report we warned him and then they
[01:10.720 --> 01:13.800]  totally banned him the next day because he told him that it's their right to
[01:13.800 --> 01:19.080]  ban whoever they want no it's not the Austin American statesman has a giant
[01:19.080 --> 01:27.080]  disinfo piece filled with just absolute BS and garbage but if you go to drudge
[01:27.080 --> 01:32.480]  report.com that articles link and then under it Alex Jones slams the tactics
[01:32.480 --> 01:38.920]  of the tech left to shut down free speech and look if you scroll down the
[01:38.920 --> 01:46.040]  video's been removed by Facebook that's right they only blocked us from
[01:46.040 --> 01:52.080]  uploading or streaming on the Alexander Emrick channel which a fan created like
[01:52.080 --> 01:55.880]  eight years ago and gave to us that has had like two million likes but they've
[01:55.880 --> 01:59.920]  removed a bunch of like one point six million people that follow it and they
[01:59.920 --> 02:04.520]  explained the other profiles haven't been taken down but then we stream on
[02:04.520 --> 02:08.840]  those and the left freaks out or even upload videos and they complain and so
[02:08.840 --> 02:13.120]  then whoever works at Facebook just rogue goes into leaps that too so look
[02:13.120 --> 02:16.560]  you do a video about how you're being lied about and about how you're being
[02:16.560 --> 02:23.760]  censored but but we've now just just updated because it was dead I I haven't
[02:23.760 --> 02:30.600]  refresh on this computer so see that even take down the video of me laying it
[02:30.600 --> 02:34.920]  all out but I'm gonna call Watson or just tell one of the crew I want to add
[02:34.920 --> 02:41.360]  Adams report and Paul's article from two weeks ago at the top saying must read
[02:41.360 --> 02:46.400]  breakdown of how their shadow banning all conservatives all Christians all
[02:46.400 --> 02:51.360]  libertarians all nationalists they've already been doing this in China they've
[02:51.360 --> 02:55.960]  already been doing this in
[02:57.760 --> 03:02.440]  Europe and so this is the big issue and this is how they're gonna try to steal
[03:02.440 --> 03:07.800]  the election and this is how they're giving themselves all these campaign
[03:07.800 --> 03:11.600]  contributions the Democrats are at Facebook at YouTube at Google at Twitter
[03:11.600 --> 03:19.320]  when they say all Republicans are Nazis on the official Google fact page or when
[03:19.320 --> 03:23.960]  they put only positive news about Hillary up top breaking their algorithm or
[03:23.960 --> 03:27.640]  when they shadow ban members of Congress we're running for reelection and
[03:27.640 --> 03:33.240]  don't let them talk to their constituents they go out the Republicans
[03:33.240 --> 03:39.040]  promote their Twitter on TV on Fox News on everywhere they hand out campaign
[03:39.040 --> 03:42.880]  cards with their Facebook or Twitter on it and then the Democrats go in and
[03:42.880 --> 03:49.080]  shadow ban it it's equivalent 24th century of you pay for your phone in this
[03:49.080 --> 03:53.240]  case you pay for it by promoting it you give them the traffic and then they
[03:53.240 --> 04:00.520]  don't let you call certain phone numbers they block who you can call and then at
[04:00.520 --> 04:03.600]  first you don't notice it you know that only half your Rolodex is blocked but
[04:03.600 --> 04:06.920]  singular it's 90 percent then it's a hundred percent and they're doing this
[04:06.920 --> 04:10.920]  all and it's criminal and they're organized we need to get organized
[04:10.920 --> 04:14.840]  because everybody's getting censored but nobody organizes we're trying to
[04:14.840 --> 04:19.600]  organize people at a congressional level to take action and that's why the left
[04:19.600 --> 04:27.240]  has made me number one enemy all over the news everywhere saying take Alex Jones
[04:27.240 --> 04:33.800]  off Spotify take Alex Jones off of iTunes we've been on for years take us
[04:33.800 --> 04:39.320]  off everything and then lie lie lie lie lie and then say oh he's being sued for
[04:39.320 --> 04:43.280]  things he never said so that's the proof he has to be taken off the internet
[04:43.280 --> 04:48.400]  unbelievable CNN's been sued more than 10,000 times and they are fake news and
[04:48.400 --> 04:51.760]  then they're the one a failed news network out promoting all their
[04:51.760 --> 04:56.400]  alternatives to be shut down unbelievably transparent it's sickening
[04:56.400 --> 05:02.400]  and they're going to lose big time living in volcano may sound more
[05:02.400 --> 05:06.560]  dramatic than it really is the real drama can be found here in Leilani
[05:06.560 --> 05:10.920]  estates but a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to
[05:10.920 --> 05:16.080]  be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal
[05:16.080 --> 05:21.320]  particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels to
[05:21.320 --> 05:27.840]  find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and pH what
[05:27.840 --> 05:31.360]  we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and
[05:31.360 --> 05:36.400]  acidity in the rainwater next we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity
[05:36.400 --> 05:41.600]  filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure but the pH
[05:41.600 --> 05:47.200]  was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the Alexa
[05:47.200 --> 05:52.080]  pure raises the pH of the water so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and
[05:52.080 --> 05:57.160]  acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply but more importantly a good
[05:57.160 --> 06:11.800]  water filtration system will purify it
[06:11.800 --> 06:15.720]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex
[06:15.720 --> 06:27.040]  John yeah it's a long way to the top if you want to be in a free country
[06:27.040 --> 06:32.440]  you want to have a future and be free market be successful but the alternative
[06:32.440 --> 06:38.640]  slavery the alternative is absolutely not something we're going to settle for
[06:38.640 --> 06:43.200]  ever I am your host Alex Jones are gonna be here for the next four hours Paul
[06:43.200 --> 06:48.880]  Watson's going to be joining us we've got the Patriot prayer group multi-racial
[06:48.880 --> 06:55.960]  Liberty loving group who has been attacked by Antifa repeatedly and so
[06:55.960 --> 06:59.760]  they've been caught beating up women children you name it that even mainstream
[06:59.760 --> 07:04.120]  news admits the Antifa comes and they launch the attacks well now Antifa says
[07:04.120 --> 07:10.880]  they're bringing guns they say after the Nazis attacked us unwarrantedly actually
[07:10.880 --> 07:16.960]  put this out on their official Antifa page total upside down world after the
[07:16.960 --> 07:22.240]  Nazis attacked us it's clear we're gonna have to take them out and quote eliminate
[07:22.240 --> 07:34.280]  them and so we're bringing guns so think about that folks a prayer group goes
[07:34.280 --> 07:43.120]  out to exercise free speech in America because they beat up even folks at
[07:43.120 --> 07:46.320]  four of the July parades now in Portland San Francisco in other areas these are
[07:46.320 --> 07:50.200]  such anti-american hate mongers you can't wear American flags in public
[07:50.200 --> 07:55.320]  schools the night circuits rule that it's evil and a hate symbol the city of
[07:55.320 --> 08:01.000]  Austin's officially trying to change the name from Austin saying it's racist
[08:01.000 --> 08:05.760]  here's video of them physically attacking a transsexual but the left loves
[08:05.760 --> 08:11.440]  all that this is so sick so evil again we're a radio show simulcast on
[08:11.440 --> 08:13.960]  television of your radio listener obviously you can always go to
[08:13.960 --> 08:20.760]  infowars.com or it's my show if you want to see the free feeds but continuing here
[08:20.760 --> 08:24.560]  Joey Gibson's gonna be
[08:24.840 --> 08:32.040]  popping in to discuss the prayer group that he's having the third rally there
[08:32.040 --> 08:36.840]  and it's so sick it's so evil to see how vicious these people are but getting
[08:36.840 --> 08:44.520]  back to the anti-fab it well we have an article on infowars.com that details
[08:44.520 --> 08:53.160]  it all and what's crazy about it is when you read the article there's no
[08:53.160 --> 09:01.200]  thought process to these people there's no logic they say well the Nazis keep
[09:01.200 --> 09:05.280]  attacking us and they're violent and they're attacking people of color and
[09:05.280 --> 09:10.280]  they're attacking LGBT people and so now we're gonna bring guns and eliminate
[09:10.280 --> 09:17.880]  them and then meanwhile you have a prayer event it's got white people black
[09:17.880 --> 09:24.960]  people transsexuals you name it and they get beat up and attacked in Portland in
[09:24.960 --> 09:29.040]  San Francisco you name it and because people fight back they then say the
[09:29.040 --> 09:36.240]  Nazis are attacking the LGBT and the black people and so we've got to go out
[09:36.240 --> 09:44.040]  to the event with guns and eliminate them it'd be like if you were walking
[09:44.040 --> 09:51.280]  down the street and you walk by a blue car and a crazy person runs out from the
[09:51.280 --> 09:57.120]  bushes and says get back that's a red dragon it will eat you and you go no
[09:57.120 --> 10:05.200]  it's a blue a baby blue sedan looks like it's a old LTD or something they're
[10:05.200 --> 10:10.640]  like no no it's a red dragon get back and they start stabbing it oh my gosh
[10:10.640 --> 10:16.520]  we've got prayer vigils we can't allow those so they beat up people three events
[10:16.520 --> 10:24.360]  back so then men showed up to stand up against them they physically attack them
[10:24.360 --> 10:38.400]  get their butts kicked and so then they show up at the next event and attack
[10:38.400 --> 10:46.440]  people first again so then they get responded to people defend and now
[10:46.440 --> 10:50.600]  they're gonna show up with guns because they say we're not gonna let these
[10:50.600 --> 10:56.600]  racist evil people on the streets of America we're going to de-platform them
[10:56.600 --> 11:00.200]  from their first amendment because we've dehumanized them and called them all
[11:00.200 --> 11:03.440]  these names aren't even true and now we're gonna take their rights which is
[11:03.440 --> 11:08.440]  exactly what they do to me they tell all these giant lies and they have the
[11:08.440 --> 11:12.240]  headlines everywhere Jones has been removed off Facebook and off YouTube
[11:12.240 --> 11:17.240]  that's not even true we were given fake strikes the last ones they put on months
[11:17.240 --> 11:21.320]  ago they had to remove and admitted were fake lying about what we said about
[11:21.320 --> 11:29.640]  Parkland now they've done it again saying that I endangered a child and beat up a
[11:29.640 --> 11:33.920]  child they never show where it was they never show who it is they never they
[11:33.920 --> 11:39.720]  just say Jones abused a child he's about to be banned from the internet and then
[11:39.720 --> 11:44.360]  they extrapolate that in USA today and everywhere else Jones has got to be
[11:44.360 --> 11:49.160]  de-platformed you know he the London independent especially the Brits hate
[11:49.160 --> 11:53.520]  free speech over there the folks that control that that island nation and the
[11:53.520 --> 11:57.200]  UK so they've got even more deceptive articles about Jones was banned from
[11:57.200 --> 12:02.880]  YouTube and Facebook but he hasn't been banned yet from Spotify and iTunes but
[12:02.880 --> 12:07.760]  he needs to be and he needs to be banned from Amazon the precedent of him being
[12:07.760 --> 12:13.040]  banned for hate speech and abusing a child is absolutely imperative that he be
[12:13.040 --> 12:19.360]  removed and then nowhere in thousands of articles does it show me abusing the
[12:19.360 --> 12:25.160]  child or me doing any of this it's all a giant hoax just like they do about the
[12:25.160 --> 12:33.760]  president and you've got the article up on info wars.com with the Antifa
[12:33.760 --> 12:44.000]  screenshots of what they say and what they do sitting there openly talking you
[12:44.000 --> 12:48.440]  guys reprint me that yeah there it is I had it here and I just can't find it's a
[12:48.440 --> 12:53.600]  zero-edge article on info wars.com yeah better bring our own guns Portland
[12:53.600 --> 12:58.840]  Antifa plotting direct confrontation at pro-trump rally and then you read what
[12:58.840 --> 13:04.240]  they say on their official site it's the Nazis attacked us and they beat up black
[13:04.240 --> 13:09.080]  people in LGBT and now we're gonna bring guns and we're gonna kill people
[13:09.080 --> 13:16.920]  we're gonna eliminate them meanwhile Antifa looks like the most evil group of
[13:16.920 --> 13:21.160]  ringwraiths that crawled out of the devil's rear end or something
[13:21.160 --> 13:26.660]  shilling up with devil tattoos beating up women and children and screaming in
[13:26.660 --> 13:33.200]  word at police and then frothing and going so crazy that they attack food
[13:33.200 --> 13:37.980]  trucks that they see giving service to people that walk out of federal
[13:37.980 --> 13:42.600]  buildings and in Austin they march around with guns and won't let our own
[13:42.600 --> 13:47.160]  camera people on to city parks for demonstrations right in front of the
[13:47.160 --> 13:55.740]  police. I mean this is real live authoritarianism and they sit there like
[13:55.740 --> 14:00.880]  in their own hallucination going in the Nazis came to Portland and they beat up
[14:00.880 --> 14:08.240]  the minorities and we can't let them we're gonna have to kill them. This is
[14:08.240 --> 14:14.960]  mass insanity this is beyond Trump derangement syndrome and this is what
[14:14.960 --> 14:18.840]  this country's become this is what this country has degenerated into and it's
[14:18.840 --> 14:25.320]  all been done by design now when we come back, bring me that article please I had
[14:25.320 --> 14:28.520]  it here and I just can't find it it's on inforrs.com it it's so critical to read

[14:42.520 --> 14:47.840]  know that's not true and they're just saying after the Nazis attacked us last
[14:47.840 --> 14:55.520]  time we're bringing guns and we're gonna eliminate people that's the quote and
[14:55.520 --> 15:00.520]  it's not true it's like if I have this white mouse in my hand

[18:05.960 --> 18:10.440]  an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[18:10.440 --> 18:15.440]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways eye comfort and
[18:15.440 --> 18:20.840]  respiratory function in the 1960s researchers in France noticed that
[18:20.840 --> 18:24.720]  people who ate certain quail eggs experience less seasonal immune and
[18:24.720 --> 18:29.200]  inflammatory responses they began studying this effect in published trials

[18:43.240 --> 18:47.280]  has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase which
[18:47.280 --> 18:52.240]  is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body go

[20:08.440 --> 20:26.600]  you from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones there
[20:26.600 --> 20:34.600]  must be some way out of here say the Joker to the theme there's too much
[20:34.600 --> 20:41.280]  confusion I can't get no reason okay here's what I'm gonna do next segment
[20:41.280 --> 20:46.440]  I'm gonna lay out the total globalist takeover invasion plan and document how
[20:46.440 --> 20:52.160]  it is a concerted linked up orchestrated program to collapse the West that has
[20:52.160 --> 21:00.120]  now gone into murderous high gear hundreds of invasion boats financed by
[21:00.120 --> 21:07.320]  George Soros you cannot make this up and the UN have slammed into Spain in the
[21:07.320 --> 21:13.880]  last week thousands of people now before Italy was taking the invasion boats
[21:13.880 --> 21:18.720]  and so was Greece Greece has been in a five-year total depression with people
[21:18.720 --> 21:21.880]  starving to death in many areas and leaving their babies on the doorsteps
[21:21.880 --> 21:27.000]  of hospitals as the IMF and World Bank sucks those countries dry they're gonna
[21:27.000 --> 21:37.360]  use this islamic double la reconquista to further implode Europe already their
[21:37.360 --> 21:44.760]  tourism's down over 80% now in places like
[21:45.520 --> 21:52.240]  Paris it's down over half total in countries like Spain and France it's
[21:52.240 --> 21:57.800]  unbelievable the point that we've gotten to here and again why would
[21:57.800 --> 22:03.000]  governments do that because it's part of a larger plan and then we have the
[22:03.000 --> 22:09.120]  footage after the invasion forces hit they then literally come out of war
[22:09.120 --> 22:18.800]  torn North Africa that is hell on earth and just began raping robbing stealing
[22:18.800 --> 22:24.760]  burning and we've got all that footage it's coming up but don't worry we've
[22:24.760 --> 22:29.520]  got a jib Barbie now telling young girls how great it is to wear a jibs
[22:29.520 --> 22:35.000]  that's coming up of course don't get caught in most areas we're not wearing
[22:35.000 --> 22:40.920]  a full burqa or you'll get stoned to death what do they have stoned to death
[22:40.920 --> 22:44.440]  Barbie maybe
[22:44.440 --> 22:48.920]  maybe they have a Barbie set where the whole family gets together and stones
[22:48.920 --> 22:51.880]  her because she's got her face seen because you know that just happened in
[22:51.880 --> 22:59.480]  Saudi Arabia man has been arrested for kissing a woman on video through her
[22:59.480 --> 23:13.560]  burqa so that is the wonderful wonderful world of radical Islam and I would be
[23:13.560 --> 23:19.040]  surprised if they don't stone her to death and maybe that's the new Barbie set
[23:19.040 --> 23:24.040]  you get because we're being introduced to radical Islam maybe maybe maybe we
[23:24.040 --> 23:33.640]  have be behead Barbie where you know you've got Ken you know where's an
[23:33.640 --> 23:40.800]  executioner mask and you pull a little string and he goes I can I can pull
[23:40.800 --> 23:43.920]  video up right now don't do it because you can't show what the precious
[23:43.920 --> 23:51.760]  Islamist is to of women being beheaded for being caught out without their
[23:51.760 --> 23:55.800]  burqas on but we're just gonna give you training wheels here and teach you how
[23:55.800 --> 24:01.600]  to put on the hijab like German TV during the after school specials teaches
[24:01.600 --> 24:06.440]  the girls get yourself an Islamic man who's 25 they are good men and they
[24:06.440 --> 24:10.080]  give them manuals on how to get their 14 year old girlfriend and they tell the
[24:10.080 --> 24:14.080]  14 year old girls these are real TV shows you get your man parents let your
[24:14.080 --> 24:19.520]  daughter have an Islamist at 14 and then you can learn to wear the hijab and
[24:19.520 --> 24:23.640]  they've got rock stars and people in Germany and in German saying I wear the
[24:23.640 --> 24:29.680]  hijab now it is fun it is good we wear hijab we wear hijab I used to hear there
[24:29.680 --> 24:33.880]  was a planned Islamic takeover but you know what it's really true that's all
[24:33.880 --> 24:40.060]  coming up next segment I'm gonna go through all of it in detail and so much
[24:40.060 --> 24:48.120]  more but the big push right now is to shut us off the air and to sue us and to
[24:48.120 --> 24:54.840]  lie about us and to say all these things that we never said and to take
[24:54.840 --> 25:00.120]  things out of context just like the Mueller indictments aren't for Russian
[25:00.120 --> 25:07.160]  collusion but it's just to say we've got indictments well well Alex Jones is
[25:07.160 --> 25:15.680]  being sued and they don't even bother to say it's
[25:15.680 --> 25:19.160]  Sandy Hook they say Jones is being sued for saying nobody got it Parkland
[25:19.160 --> 25:24.560]  never said it but that's how they operate these stories up on drug report
[25:24.560 --> 25:29.480]  calm where I respond to the lies and again it's critical that they be able
[25:29.480 --> 25:36.000]  to strangle us in our voice so they can then defame us and misrepresent us as the
[25:36.000 --> 25:40.160]  poster child of taking all of your speech which every conservative every
[25:40.160 --> 25:48.800]  libertarian every Christian every church I know has had Facebook and Twitter
[25:48.800 --> 25:55.200]  blocked them and not let them reach people it's it's it's it's a total
[25:55.200 --> 26:01.360]  attack on America and on freedom now coming up we also have a petition on
[26:01.360 --> 26:07.480]  info wars calm that I will deliver to the president and it's important to sign
[26:07.480 --> 26:10.000]  the petition to so we know that you're into the First Amendment and you want
[26:10.000 --> 26:13.680]  to get alerts on what's happening so you can also contact Congress I'm gonna
[26:13.680 --> 26:18.560]  send this the petition to Congress to free Julian Assange who is early as
[26:18.560 --> 26:26.040]  tomorrow they say could be kicked out of the Ecuadorian embassy and shipped back
[26:26.040 --> 26:33.800]  to the United States to face trial for espionage for leaking criminal activity
[26:33.800 --> 26:39.840]  that the government was involved in the man deserves a medal he deserves a high
[26:39.840 --> 26:43.880]  honor a presidential freedom award he does not deserve to be put in a prison
[26:43.880 --> 26:49.280]  but wait for that giant trial let's get the president to pardon him we've
[26:49.280 --> 26:51.840]  already gotten the president to pardon the folks before they even gave us credit
[26:51.840 --> 26:55.840]  for that I will get this information to the president you can be absolutely
[26:55.840 --> 27:02.760]  assured of that so go to info wars calm it's red linked at info wars calm
[27:02.760 --> 27:09.160]  petition to Trump pardon Julian Assange now that's it we are running a big

[27:50.960 --> 27:56.240]  study fish oil this is the very best because we have we have the very
[27:56.240 --> 28:00.640]  expensive extraction process that makes sure that it gets the mercury out to
[28:00.640 --> 28:04.160]  non-detectable levels so you just get the good benefits of fish oil that are

[33:53.280 --> 34:00.440]  ladies and gentlemen we are back live and we are broadcasting worldwide you
[34:00.440 --> 34:07.760]  know if I even try to properly address what's happening I just get really
[34:07.760 --> 34:17.720]  really angry at myself and feel like I'm not doing it justice it's it's that
[34:17.720 --> 34:35.920]  crazy the organized crime nature of thousands of establishment publications
[34:35.920 --> 34:40.200]  and so-called news organizations perpetuating violence against Trump
[34:40.200 --> 34:44.840]  supporters perpetuating civil war perpetuating hashtag hunt Republicans
[34:44.840 --> 34:50.920]  perpetuating antifa perpetuating fake wars that they lied about WMDs to get
[34:50.920 --> 34:55.560]  us into and then to see that thread throughout the publication saying info
[34:55.560 --> 35:01.800]  wars should be taken off the air for perpetuating violence and then they
[35:01.800 --> 35:06.040]  don't even have any examples they can use unless it was the whole tongue and
[35:06.040 --> 35:11.400]  cheek thing about high noon political shootout with robert moeller which was
[35:11.400 --> 35:17.640]  100% clear but they don't even really give that example because they know it
[35:17.640 --> 35:23.280]  doesn't fly they just say oh perpetuating violence against lgbt and
[35:23.280 --> 35:29.760]  perpetuating violence against Muslims and perpetuating child endangerment and
[35:29.760 --> 35:35.240]  then don't show you what it is you understand what fundamental frauds
[35:35.240 --> 35:39.960]  these sjw is that go get their worthless degrees and then they go get paid
[35:39.960 --> 35:45.120]  $10,000 a year on average to work for these so-called publications like vox
[35:45.120 --> 35:51.920]  and vice and all the rest of it to openly say we want alex jones the
[35:51.920 --> 35:54.360]  platform
[35:59.880 --> 36:04.160]  think about that they don't want us having access to the market of ideas
[36:04.160 --> 36:08.240]  because no one wants to read them no one wants to see them and their so-called
[36:08.240 --> 36:12.760]  news organizations calling for other people's speech whether they call us
[36:12.760 --> 36:21.560]  news or not to be taken down but here's the problem you've got every member of
[36:21.560 --> 36:26.080]  congress who's a republican is going and learning now with the different tech
[36:26.080 --> 36:32.800]  sites that are out there they can check and see if they've been shadow band and
[36:32.800 --> 36:38.120]  they're all finding out that they've been choked back 90% or more in some case
[36:38.120 --> 36:45.280]  is to where no one can see their tweets unless you go to the page I used to send
[36:45.280 --> 36:49.960]  out tweets the average retweet like 10,000 they shadow band does so bad
[36:49.960 --> 36:55.240]  until Congress got involved and now we're still 90% that you'd get one
[36:55.240 --> 37:02.040]  retweet no one could see it and then they'd go oh no we only moderate tweets
[37:02.040 --> 37:10.800]  that are dangerous or hateful I'd try to send a clip out of President Trump
[37:10.800 --> 37:15.160]  talking about unity and bringing America together and fighting racism and
[37:15.160 --> 37:20.320]  that's the type of thing that would get no retweets because they don't want
[37:20.320 --> 37:25.440]  unity they want division every Netflix show every movie every magazine it's all
[37:25.440 --> 37:29.960]  race war race war race war race war race war negativity negativity
[37:29.960 --> 37:37.560]  negativity negativity lies fraud disinfo I got to working on stuff there in
[37:37.560 --> 37:40.360]  the break and got distracted and I'm not ready to get into the invasion of
[37:40.360 --> 37:44.280]  Europe the invasion of the US and the invasion ships slamming in and what's
[37:44.280 --> 37:48.360]  really behind that I'm gonna do that next segment but I've got to stay in here
[37:48.360 --> 37:51.760]  during the break and not go do five other jobs because that's what I do is I
[37:51.760 --> 37:56.240]  make the decisions basically on everything around here and I try not to
[37:56.240 --> 38:04.680]  but a lot of times I have to we got a great crew and I'm gonna do my best but
[38:04.680 --> 38:11.960]  this is so premeditated it's so destructive and everything they're
[38:11.960 --> 38:17.600]  doing is basically a giant bullying temper tantrum and everything they're
[38:17.600 --> 38:28.160]  saying about us is what they're really doing they are licking their chops and
[38:28.160 --> 38:32.120]  what one media organization does is they'll put out the first lie and the
[38:32.120 --> 38:35.800]  next group embellishes and then more embellish and then more embellish and
[38:35.800 --> 38:39.560]  like a game of telephone you know where you go around the table and whisper
[38:39.560 --> 38:41.960]  something somebody's here and by the time it gets around the table it's a
[38:41.960 --> 38:47.160]  totally new story doesn't even represent what the first person said once it goes
[38:47.160 --> 38:53.080]  through 10 people they're still saying I beat up a child in an unknown town they
[38:53.080 --> 38:57.440]  don't say where when police report they just say jones is being kicked off
[38:57.440 --> 39:03.040]  YouTube and Facebook because he beat up a child
[39:03.600 --> 39:12.360]  Jones is a bully it's what you hear over and over and over again Jones bullied
[39:12.360 --> 39:23.600]  the anti-gun people in Parkland
[39:23.600 --> 39:44.800]  it really is mind-blowing to see this level of lies but that's what they do
[39:44.800 --> 39:48.600]  and imagine being the president where they won't look at any of his
[39:48.600 --> 39:52.440]  accomplishments they won't look at any of the positive things that have been
[39:52.440 --> 40:00.720]  done all they do is fight as hard as they can to suppress that information from
[40:00.720 --> 40:08.080]  coming out President Trump tweeted a short video I'm gonna play here showing
[40:08.080 --> 40:17.480]  the accomplishments of the last year and a half and sure enough I went and look
[40:17.480 --> 40:22.800]  Twitter is blocking us and others being able to share this because they want to
[40:22.800 --> 40:25.880]  demoralize the country they want to dumb it down they want to control it
[40:25.880 --> 40:29.080]  here's what they don't want you to see

[47:02.320 --> 47:07.720]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[47:07.720 --> 47:32.560]  a lot of people ask me Alex how do you keep predicting what's gonna happen and
[47:32.560 --> 47:37.960]  how did you know how Trump would counter the globalist because I've researched
[47:37.960 --> 47:41.280]  how the world government works I've researched how United States power
[47:41.280 --> 47:46.520]  operates I know who the players are I've read the Britain Woods agreement I've
[47:46.520 --> 47:51.160]  read the white papers written by the top globalist going back a hundred years the
[47:51.160 --> 47:56.560]  Rockefeller Foundation I mean I really know how the world works and it's not
[47:56.560 --> 48:03.400]  what you see on CNN for sure and there has been a decision by the most powerful
[48:03.400 --> 48:08.480]  corporations in the world to bring down the West and to bring down the middle
[48:08.480 --> 48:13.920]  clash and to bring down the Renaissance and to bring down the idea of upwardly
[48:13.920 --> 48:19.720]  mobile individuals and the argument is oh austerity is good to save the earth
[48:19.720 --> 48:25.400]  but really it's about political control and being able to dictate exactly how
[48:25.400 --> 48:31.080]  people live and what they do now they say a picture can tell a thousand words
[48:31.080 --> 48:35.840]  well video can tell a million words and there have been over 10 million
[48:35.840 --> 48:39.800]  military aged men of the 12 million people that have come in the last five
[48:39.800 --> 48:45.080]  years six years to Europe and some numbers are even higher now think about
[48:45.080 --> 48:49.080]  those numbers and almost all of them are military aged men and when you watch
[48:49.080 --> 48:53.880]  these videos if you're a radio listener go to infowars.com there's new footage
[48:53.880 --> 49:03.800]  even more dramatic than what we've seen in previous years of what looks like
[49:03.800 --> 49:10.440]  invasion boats from the marine invasion of the islands controlled by the
[49:10.440 --> 49:19.640]  Japanese and it's the Spanish on different sea resorts as boat after boat
[49:19.640 --> 49:26.240]  pulls up and over a hundred people disgorge off of each boat and there are
[49:26.240 --> 49:31.580]  dozens of these new videos popping up and then there's video hours later
[49:31.580 --> 49:38.760]  inland with them robbing cars carjacking raping killing there is an
[49:38.760 --> 49:42.400]  exodus out of North Africa one of the most dangerous places in the world out
[49:42.400 --> 49:58.160]  of failed places like Libya pouring in and once these populations get there it
[49:58.160 --> 50:03.320]  just completely blows everyone away because of the crime rate and the
[50:03.320 --> 50:11.800]  insanity and the attacks that take place this video is so dramatic but the
[50:11.800 --> 50:15.280]  globalists don't want you to know that they've got this invasion in full swing
[50:15.280 --> 50:27.320]  and that they plan to bring in 200 million North Africans by 2035 and that
[50:27.320 --> 50:37.240]  they want the UN announced last week 600 million Latin Americans by 2050 and
[50:37.240 --> 50:43.040]  it's the UN and UNESCO that sets the goals and in Spain and the other EU
[50:43.040 --> 50:50.560]  countries the UN sets the migration rules they set the invasion rules they set
[50:50.560 --> 50:57.640]  the US rules via the State Department via UNESCO until last year when President
[50:57.640 --> 51:03.560]  Trump said we're not gonna have the UN run the refugee program anymore they're
[51:03.560 --> 51:09.120]  letting people in from unvetted nations like Somalia and Sudan who were
[51:09.120 --> 51:13.480]  terrorists oh and I almost forgot remember the Manchester bombing that was
[51:13.480 --> 51:17.960]  Islamic and if you said it was Islamic Twitter and Facebook would kick you off
[51:17.960 --> 51:26.120]  or block you turns out the bomber was saved four years ago in Syria by the
[51:26.120 --> 51:34.600]  British Royal Navy headline out of the Daily Mail Brits outraged as it's
[51:34.600 --> 51:41.040]  discovered that he was saved was really an al-Qaeda fighter by the British
[51:41.040 --> 51:47.160]  Navy in Syria he was there fighting against the side and then he was brought
[51:47.160 --> 51:53.760]  back and put on full welfare with a town estate home is what it's called better
[51:53.760 --> 52:00.640]  than what a veteran would get and weekly money
[52:01.680 --> 52:05.440]  that was on info wars.com today just just just type it in here here's the
[52:05.440 --> 52:13.120]  headline Brits outraged to learn Manchester bomber was saved by the
[52:13.120 --> 52:17.040]  British Royal Navy
[52:17.040 --> 52:26.960]  now think about that and think about that long and hard and let that sink in
[52:26.960 --> 52:32.360]  Brits furious some in reports UK Navy rescued Manchester bomber prior to
[52:32.360 --> 52:39.000]  attack the attack was a year ago they've saved him three years before four
[52:39.000 --> 52:43.880]  years ago and he had free welfare and everything and he could wear his
[52:43.880 --> 52:49.120]  nightgown his little Islamic nightgown he could do whatever he wanted but it's
[52:49.120 --> 52:54.800]  okay though because you see Saudi man let's show people this video oh by the
[52:54.800 --> 52:57.120]  way they'll probably take this off Facebook or Twitter because it violates
[52:57.120 --> 53:01.600]  Islamic law to show a Muslim man kissing a Muslim woman I have to be Sharia
[53:01.600 --> 53:08.200]  compliant it's hateful that I say I don't want to live under this or pay for
[53:08.200 --> 53:13.640]  it Saudi man arrested after he dared to kiss his girlfriend on the cheek as he
[53:13.640 --> 53:17.360]  taught her to drive
[53:17.720 --> 53:24.800]  they've got the new a jib Barbie in a lot of Islamic countries he had jib Barbie
[53:24.800 --> 53:32.240]  would be stoned to death is it that terrible if she wasn't wearing a full
[53:32.240 --> 53:38.920]  hijab so now we need our hijab Barbie and I've seen seeing it and others had
[53:38.920 --> 53:41.640]  these whole pieces about how great it is to be Islamic and they're teaching
[53:41.640 --> 53:44.520]  girls in school how to do it just like they do in Germany it's the same
[53:44.520 --> 53:49.800]  program and they hand out sex manuals to the Muslim men on how to pick up young
[53:49.800 --> 53:54.680]  European girls that's the headline how to have sex with them and the judges have
[53:54.680 --> 53:58.480]  ruled you can have sexes with nine-year-olds because it's your religion
[53:58.480 --> 54:03.800]  Finland ruled a month ago that they can have sex with your nine-year-old
[54:03.800 --> 54:08.480]  daughter right here this guy's 25 that's his 14-year-old German girlfriend and
[54:08.480 --> 54:13.600]  it's a it's a show for teens about how much fun it is and how hot it is to get
[54:13.600 --> 54:20.280]  your Muslim boyfriend boy they're not force-feeding any of this are they and
[54:20.280 --> 54:27.800]  the show is like so she's 14 it's love just don't get on an airplane with one
[54:27.800 --> 54:30.480]  of those husbands and go to the Middle East because a lot of those guys have
[54:30.480 --> 54:36.760]  flown five or six brides in that never came back better warn your daughters
[54:36.760 --> 54:41.360]  about that they'll be watching MTV and stuff and thinking how cool it is and
[54:41.360 --> 54:46.240]  wanting to know TV set it how they want to discover how much fun it is that's
[54:46.240 --> 54:49.440]  why they're all trying to flee and come here show they can blow up your
[54:49.440 --> 54:53.000]  Manchester event and blow some little girls legs off and when I said how
[54:53.000 --> 54:55.800]  terrible it was that the left keeps getting attacked by the people they
[54:55.800 --> 55:01.400]  brought in the media said that I praise the bomber and that I attacked the
[55:01.400 --> 55:07.200]  girls in Manchester and remember that Jones Jones says they deserved it no I
[55:07.200 --> 55:11.720]  didn't say that I said why their parents many of them leftist agree to this and
[55:11.720 --> 55:15.280]  bring them in and why does the left sit there in Stockholm syndrome and let this
[55:15.280 --> 55:24.880]  happen see they're not the bad guys it's me I'm the bully see so Saudi man
[55:24.880 --> 55:32.400]  arrested after he dared to kiss his girlfriend wearing a full hijab now
[55:32.400 --> 55:37.080]  Croatia under fire for defending its border it's the new invasion site after
[55:37.080 --> 55:41.980]  the Muslim country of Albania already took one-third of Serbia under UN
[55:41.980 --> 55:47.520]  NATO bombing as their air support of course they've slaughtered literally
[55:47.520 --> 55:50.200]  hundreds of thousands of the Serbs Serbs never started the war it's all
[55:50.200 --> 55:54.360]  admitted but our media just said the Serbs are bad and so but now the
[55:54.360 --> 55:58.880]  Croatians are under attack and the EU says they may send in an EU army to open
[55:58.880 --> 56:06.000]  up the vital migration lane they've also sent UN troops into Macedonia formerly
[56:06.000 --> 56:10.920]  part of Greece or old Alexander the Great's daddy came from little fact
[56:10.920 --> 56:15.320]  bullet of history and they have now opened it up and blasted it wide open so
[56:15.320 --> 56:19.920]  let me tell you the walls are falling and the walls are falling here and
[56:19.920 --> 56:23.400]  they're occupying ice and they're saying Trump was mean to a little girl it was
[56:23.400 --> 56:26.120]  never taken from her parents and it's all lies but they don't care because
[56:26.120 --> 56:31.120]  it's the triumph of fraud but meanwhile the Saudi King Yahoo news is reporting
[56:31.120 --> 56:36.360]  French news agency has his own private mega city his own treasure city that
[56:36.360 --> 56:41.040]  isn't quite completed yet that's where he vacations and when he goes to places

[1:06:25.040 --> 1:06:28.920]  to be outsiders how we need to expose the current stagnant system that's been
[1:06:28.920 --> 1:06:32.920]  suppressing us wanting to make us poor so he consolidate control and buy us up
[1:06:32.920 --> 1:06:37.960]  for pennies on the dollar that really is the globalist system he's absolutely
[1:06:37.960 --> 1:06:44.040]  right so it is an honor to be persecuted by the globalist to be lied about to be
[1:06:44.040 --> 1:06:49.880]  demonized but it's an honor to draw them out so we can show who they are so that
[1:06:49.880 --> 1:06:53.680]  you take action and you take the country back politically culturally
[1:06:53.680 --> 1:07:02.400]  spiritually financially another hero is Julian Assange who's been in solitary
[1:07:02.400 --> 1:07:10.160]  confinement in a closet size room they converted a closet with a bed and enough
[1:07:10.160 --> 1:07:17.320]  room for a laptop they took that away over a year ago no communication with
[1:07:17.320 --> 1:07:26.400]  the outside it's all been one hell of a time for him and he was very bipartisan
[1:07:26.400 --> 1:07:32.920]  in that he exposed Republicans he exposed Democrats he very judiciously very
[1:07:32.920 --> 1:07:39.920]  very judiciously released information that exposed criminal activity of the
[1:07:39.920 --> 1:07:45.200]  NSA criminal activity of the CIA illegal spying on Congress illegal spying on
[1:07:45.200 --> 1:07:53.200]  Trump illegal spying on me the DEA then gave us information we'd indeed been
[1:07:53.200 --> 1:08:00.640]  spot-on going back to nine years ago when Obama got into office there was my
[1:08:00.640 --> 1:08:05.040]  name and phone numbers no one knew she have a tendency to kind of an office
[1:08:05.040 --> 1:08:09.560]  line and you never use it and it's like they even had my private office line that
[1:08:09.560 --> 1:08:18.080]  I might do radio interviews on once every couple weeks but they had my home
[1:08:18.080 --> 1:08:23.360]  number my old cell my new cell and my office line and they had Donald Trump's
[1:08:23.360 --> 1:08:30.560]  Mar-a-Lago private apartment number that I had can you imagine when I saw that and
[1:08:30.560 --> 1:08:35.960]  I never had the nerve to call the number that I was given to his Mar-a-Lago
[1:08:35.960 --> 1:08:48.280]  room I still have it and there I was looking at his Trump Tower private number
[1:08:48.280 --> 1:08:56.920]  his switchboard number his Mar-a-Lago number and we publish that at risk no
[1:08:56.920 --> 1:09:07.440]  media coverage total proof of Obama spying on Trump and yours truly a decade
[1:09:07.440 --> 1:09:20.400]  ago think about that and that's federal people that have access to those NSA
[1:09:20.400 --> 1:09:25.560]  databases the DEA does and imagine they see it in the news last year that we say
[1:09:25.560 --> 1:09:28.320]  we've been spied on the media's line about it all of a sudden we get the
[1:09:28.320 --> 1:09:32.760]  documents we have people associated with our pile I'll leave it at that and we
[1:09:32.760 --> 1:09:36.720]  publish them and should it have been the biggest story ever absolutely and why
[1:09:36.720 --> 1:09:46.560]  do they want to shut off here because they know at any time we can get things
[1:09:46.560 --> 1:09:52.840]  like that again and we've got the courage to slam it out there but let me
[1:09:52.840 --> 1:09:55.840]  tell you who else has got courage the man we're about to talk to for the
[1:09:55.840 --> 1:09:59.880]  balance of the hour and he'll cover the waterfront with us but
[1:10:01.480 --> 1:10:07.920]  ladies and gentlemen this is the real deal and America's had freedom so long
[1:10:07.920 --> 1:10:15.760]  people don't recognize real tyranny when it hits them right between the eyes so
[1:10:15.760 --> 1:10:18.840]  pray for America pray for President Trump please pray for info wars and pray
[1:10:18.840 --> 1:10:23.840]  for the gentleman we're about to talk to here in a moment because the bullies
[1:10:23.840 --> 1:10:28.840]  are out in force trying to intimidate us into submission it's not working and
[1:10:28.840 --> 1:10:32.840]  they don't know what to do now I can tell you I got a hundred and twenty thousand
[1:10:32.840 --> 1:10:39.080]  signatures delivered to the president concerning internet censorship and
[1:10:39.080 --> 1:10:43.840]  shadow banning and asking him to form a commission and to get the different
[1:10:43.840 --> 1:10:46.680]  people that have been victims of it who are prominent but also the general
[1:10:46.680 --> 1:10:50.680]  public together to show a compendium and an example of it and I can tell you I
[1:10:50.680 --> 1:10:54.360]  was then asked to put together a report by certain individuals I'll leave it at
[1:10:54.360 --> 1:10:58.600]  that but that report has gotten to Congress and the president two weeks ago
[1:10:58.600 --> 1:11:02.400]  and that you now see the president tweeting about he's gotten the reports
[1:11:02.400 --> 1:11:07.520]  and he knows about the shadow banning and it's illegal so he had to get the
[1:11:07.520 --> 1:11:12.960]  economy turned on first he had to get the border secured first he had to get
[1:11:12.960 --> 1:11:16.880]  the traders out of the summer is the government first now he can move into
[1:11:16.880 --> 1:11:21.080]  showing the attacks on free speech it's a bit popular issue it's an important
[1:11:21.080 --> 1:11:25.120]  issue it's paramount and that's top-linked on info wars.com save the
[1:11:25.120 --> 1:11:31.080]  internet but everyone needs to go to info wars.com the article is right up
[1:11:31.080 --> 1:11:36.720]  there at the top of the page red linked petition to Trump pardon Julian Assange
[1:11:36.720 --> 1:11:47.760]  we go over all the facts and we go over the fact that he engaged in regular
[1:11:47.760 --> 1:11:51.720]  journalistic activity and did a wonderful job being advised by top
[1:11:51.720 --> 1:11:55.320]  journals and professors around the world and that he was very very fair about
[1:11:55.320 --> 1:12:01.800]  what he did and that you need to send the message that he's a hero now I know
[1:12:01.800 --> 1:12:05.160]  they claim he's a Russian agent with no evidence and all the rest that garbage
[1:12:05.160 --> 1:12:12.240]  even though they released stuff on Russia and Israel as well and China but
[1:12:12.240 --> 1:12:15.880]  doesn't matter it's the right thing to do and you wouldn't have gotten elected
[1:12:15.880 --> 1:12:18.760]  without drudge you wouldn't have gotten elected without what you've done
[1:12:18.760 --> 1:12:22.200]  obviously you can't say it's any one person but without any of us together
[1:12:22.200 --> 1:12:35.440]  it wouldn't have happened so we need the president to pardon Julian Assange we've
[1:12:35.440 --> 1:12:41.200]  got another change.org petition that's got a lot of signatures dealing with
[1:12:41.200 --> 1:12:45.400]  stopping shadow banning and all of this just draws attention all of this just
[1:12:45.400 --> 1:12:49.160]  chips away at what they're doing but if it wasn't for Julian Assange you can
[1:12:49.160 --> 1:12:56.280]  say clearly that the president wouldn't have been elected and you said in a
[1:12:56.280 --> 1:13:00.600]  speech I don't care who got her illegal server it's illegal it's about what she
[1:13:00.600 --> 1:13:04.720]  did that's wrong don't change the subject go back to that instinct sir but
[1:13:04.720 --> 1:13:09.320]  you told Assange release it you said release more stuff and he's in the
[1:13:09.320 --> 1:13:13.880]  crosshairs and he needs to be pardoned if he's brought back to the United States
[1:13:13.880 --> 1:13:19.000]  if you signal you're gonna pardon him there there's no real charges in
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:24.440]  England there's only this bail jumping thing he will be released the fake sex
[1:13:24.440 --> 1:13:31.640]  charges that two women connected to the CIA he picked up at a bar who went back
[1:13:31.640 --> 1:13:38.560]  to his hotel room and had sex with Assange and then later they decided maybe
[1:13:38.560 --> 1:13:42.160]  that one of them didn't give him permission oldest trick in the book
[1:13:42.160 --> 1:13:51.400]  folks that's all been dropped he would be the first man let his you know what
[1:13:51.400 --> 1:14:01.960]  get him in trouble so I'm in the same boat as Assange and and Trump and others
[1:14:01.960 --> 1:14:06.840]  that are willing to tell the truth so we need the president to do this but I
[1:14:06.840 --> 1:14:12.120]  need you first to go sign the petition at info wars.com there's a big link up
[1:14:12.120 --> 1:14:15.160]  there that says save the internet that goes to our special report detailing how
[1:14:15.160 --> 1:14:20.760]  these shadow baddies going on there's 11,931 signatures I only plugged it at
[1:14:20.760 --> 1:14:25.440]  the end of the show yesterday we need to get a couple hundred thousand
[1:14:25.440 --> 1:14:29.520]  signatures to really get attention and I'll pull the stunt like I already did
[1:14:29.520 --> 1:14:37.320]  last time of shipping an entire pallet at that time to Trump Tower it made
[1:14:37.320 --> 1:14:41.240]  quite a stir but it got attention you could also put a little note about what

[1:14:52.520 --> 1:14:55.680]  stunt again because under the mail they have to take it and I think I may ship
[1:14:55.680 --> 1:15:02.240]  all of them on one-page sheets to Congress and to the White House but

[1:21:16.440 --> 1:21:22.760]  amount of discipline that the so-called entire profession of journalists lie
[1:21:22.760 --> 1:21:32.520]  professionally about me and the president is simply absolutely totally and
[1:21:32.520 --> 1:21:39.400]  completely mind-blowing joining us for the rest of the hour is Joey Gibson talk
[1:21:39.400 --> 1:21:43.040]  about being lied about here's the article on from zero hedge dot com on info
[1:21:43.040 --> 1:21:49.040]  you got to go read this better bring our own guns Portland Antifa plotting
[1:21:49.040 --> 1:21:55.520]  direct confrontation at pro-trump rally on their official Facebook Twitter pages
[1:21:55.520 --> 1:22:00.520]  they openly say the leaders of it that after the Nazis came out and attacked
[1:22:00.520 --> 1:22:06.560]  LBGT and black people and attacked us we're bringing guns this time talk about
[1:22:06.560 --> 1:22:15.480]  total mental illness or just total deception talk about that ladies and
[1:22:15.480 --> 1:22:21.880]  gentlemen because there are no white supremacist out at these things
[1:22:21.880 --> 1:22:26.640]  Antifa has been attacking people for no reason they attacked a bunch of people a
[1:22:26.640 --> 1:22:30.440]  few weeks ago and they and got their butts kicked even the local liberal news
[1:22:30.440 --> 1:22:37.160]  admitted Antifa attacked the police took weapons from them guns ammo knives clubs
[1:22:37.160 --> 1:22:43.960]  and then they say we've been attacked by Nazis who are attacking gay people so
[1:22:43.960 --> 1:22:51.400]  we're going to go out and quote eliminate folks that's Antifa beating up a
[1:22:51.400 --> 1:22:56.960]  transsexual but then the transsexual fought back so Antifa had the video
[1:22:56.960 --> 1:23:01.440]  removed I read saying that they were bullied and YouTube agreed they said
[1:23:01.440 --> 1:23:08.720]  when seven guys beat up a transsexual if their Antifa the transsexual is bad
[1:23:08.720 --> 1:23:16.960]  Antifa is at the hierarchy of leftist gods it's it's the top so let's go to
[1:23:16.960 --> 1:23:20.520]  our guests for the balance of the hour Joey Gibson Gibson for Freedom comm who
[1:23:20.520 --> 1:23:23.600]  saw this evil the last few years the attacks on Trump supporters began doing
[1:23:23.600 --> 1:23:28.920]  prayer vigils and we've had many of the folks on black folks white folks
[1:23:28.920 --> 1:23:32.960]  Hispanic Asian a lot of liberals come out that are real liberals and they go
[1:23:32.960 --> 1:23:37.360]  man yeah well finally they had their event in San Francisco member and
[1:23:37.360 --> 1:23:40.360]  finally it made Pelosi admit they were terror group because they started
[1:23:40.360 --> 1:23:44.040]  beating the cops up and then just randomly beating other people up and
[1:23:44.040 --> 1:23:48.080]  screaming the n-word so we I'm not going to show those videos but there was
[1:23:48.080 --> 1:23:53.520]  another big fight at the Hollywood star the last two fights the people attacking
[1:23:53.520 --> 1:23:59.720]  Trump supporters keep calling them the n-word so wow you know someone by their
[1:23:59.720 --> 1:24:03.040]  enemies Joey Gibson you've got another event coming up you've got a lot of
[1:24:03.040 --> 1:24:08.160]  courage this weekend we're sending reporters there I would absolutely love
[1:24:08.160 --> 1:24:12.480]  to come and I need to be there but I am tied down the enemy has three lawsuits
[1:24:12.480 --> 1:24:17.640]  against me here in Austin that we're battling to try to get me off air but
[1:24:17.640 --> 1:24:23.080]  I've got special exception to be able to be on air people recognize that's
[1:24:23.080 --> 1:24:26.640]  happening so I don't have to be in all these courierings even though judges
[1:24:26.640 --> 1:24:29.480]  normally want that it's it's it's very clear this is deliberate to delay me
[1:24:29.480 --> 1:24:34.040]  here but or I would be there with you Joey I believe Owen Schreuer is going
[1:24:34.040 --> 1:24:41.200]  right so I know back a few weeks ago he is going oh and Jake so much is
[1:24:41.200 --> 1:24:44.000]  happening ladies and gentlemen I can't even track up it anymore so Joey we're
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:47.720]  praying for you I just went over what they said about you will read more of
[1:24:47.720 --> 1:24:51.360]  it the next segment that's longer but I mean I tell you to exercise freedom in
[1:24:51.360 --> 1:24:55.520]  this country their shadow banning everybody they're blocking Republican
[1:24:55.520 --> 1:25:00.000]  Congress people from tweeting they are attacking people on the street they're
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:04.800]  saying take us off Spotify ban us I mean the left has gone into full war mode I
[1:25:04.800 --> 1:25:07.440]  think it's ahead of the elections and I think they're gonna pull something big
[1:25:07.440 --> 1:25:11.320]  not just this weekend I think I think they're gonna go for broke what do you
[1:25:11.320 --> 1:25:16.320]  think yeah I have a gut feeling a lot of people have kind of been feeling the
[1:25:16.320 --> 1:25:20.600]  same way we feel like something big is gonna happen I think August 4th will be
[1:25:20.600 --> 1:25:23.600]  big there's gonna be a lot of people down there but there's a lot of rhetoric
[1:25:23.600 --> 1:25:28.520]  it's weird how all the news media outlets out of nowhere and coordination
[1:25:28.520 --> 1:25:32.600]  come out the exact same story that I specifically move the rally so that we
[1:25:32.600 --> 1:25:36.400]  can bring guns and basically imply that we want to escalate and shoot people
[1:25:36.400 --> 1:25:39.800]  which is completely not true we've always had guns at every single rally that
[1:25:39.800 --> 1:25:44.800]  we have we just don't pull them out so well we have anti-fa all over the
[1:25:44.800 --> 1:25:47.360]  country but also here to Owen Schreuer who I'm gonna ask to come in the studio I
[1:25:47.360 --> 1:25:50.400]  should have thought of that we're trying to go to a vigil for the lady killed by
[1:25:50.400 --> 1:25:53.600]  the illegal alien the San Francisco virtue signalers said hey you're allowed
[1:25:53.600 --> 1:25:57.520]  to kill her no big deal good job you know they've been deported four times all
[1:25:57.520 --> 1:26:02.040]  the rest of it they bring out AK-47s in front of the police with their fingers
[1:26:02.040 --> 1:26:06.200]  on the trigger that's illegal and that's brandishing under Texas law and they say
[1:26:06.200 --> 1:26:10.600]  we're blue city and they say are you shaking are you afraid we're not gonna
[1:26:10.600 --> 1:26:14.560]  let you and they bumping and hitting with clubs and the police said we're
[1:26:14.560 --> 1:26:21.760]  ordered to stand out what do you make of that jelly I saw that I remember that
[1:26:21.760 --> 1:26:25.720]  when that happened that was crazy and I remember Schreuer was trying to like walk
[1:26:25.720 --> 1:26:29.560]  around them and then all he had to do is kind of run and jog and got around but
[1:26:29.560 --> 1:26:33.400]  we've seen this all the time if you look at what happened with ice and Portland
[1:26:33.400 --> 1:26:36.960]  they're now complaining about the fact that the Portland police the mayor had
[1:26:36.960 --> 1:26:40.720]  the Portland police stand down when ice officials called the police because they
[1:26:40.720 --> 1:26:43.840]  felt like their lives are in danger the Portland police refused to show up to
[1:26:43.840 --> 1:26:47.040]  help them and so we have a political problem right now in these far left
[1:26:47.040 --> 1:26:50.800]  cities and that's why we've been doing everything that we do especially down in
[1:26:50.800 --> 1:26:55.360]  Berkeley San Francisco Portland's you know Olympia to go in there and challenge
[1:26:55.360 --> 1:26:57.960]  it because if you don't challenge it then the world won't see it the country
[1:26:57.960 --> 1:27:01.440]  won't see it and there'll be no pressure on these mayors and the city council
[1:27:01.440 --> 1:27:07.080]  members well you've got all these mayors saying revolt don't arrest MS-13
[1:27:07.080 --> 1:27:12.000]  resist the police I mean this is real dangerous sedition and what's up with
[1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:17.240]  the n-word every demonstration now it's white people and others screaming the
[1:27:17.240 --> 1:27:22.240]  n-word at black officers what the hell's going on there I don't know it's
[1:27:22.240 --> 1:27:26.080]  really ironic it's like everything's flipped upside down now you know right
[1:27:26.080 --> 1:27:29.880]  his left left and right up is down because I see these people you know we
[1:27:29.880 --> 1:27:33.000]  have a lot of people from the LGBT community that marched with us as you
[1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:38.520]  saw that was Amber she's a transsexual we have Aaron she's that transsexual that
[1:27:38.520 --> 1:27:42.840]  was on top of a guy beating him up who tried to attack her and they say some
[1:27:42.840 --> 1:27:46.080]  of us derogatory words towards them but yet they say that we're the ones that
[1:27:46.080 --> 1:27:49.920]  are homophobic and we're trying to attack people from the LGBT community we
[1:27:49.920 --> 1:27:53.200]  believe in freedom so I don't care what you do in your house I don't care who
[1:27:53.200 --> 1:27:57.200]  you want to marry it's not my problem you can do and say whatever you want just
[1:27:57.200 --> 1:28:01.600]  don't hurt other people and they project on to me that I'm I'm being kicked off
[1:28:01.600 --> 1:28:05.080]  the internet for child bullying and never show what I did because I didn't do
[1:28:05.080 --> 1:28:09.640]  anything and then they say that I'm calling for violence against LBG
[1:28:09.640 --> 1:28:15.200]  whatever that's total bull yeah I get that all the time I would say one of the
[1:28:15.200 --> 1:28:18.880]  craziest things is they constantly say that I have hate speech and so we have
[1:28:18.880 --> 1:28:22.760]  put on a $2,000 bounty for anyone that can find any hate speech anything that
[1:28:22.760 --> 1:28:26.720]  I've said that's remotely hateful and they get too grand and no one no one's
[1:28:26.720 --> 1:28:30.200]  even tried to bring up anything because everything that I've said is it's from

[1:33:32.560 --> 1:33:37.560]  a 21st century psychological war a war of bullying a war of lies a war of
[1:33:37.560 --> 1:33:42.040]  intimidation and whatever the enemy does to us the big mega banks the big media
[1:33:42.040 --> 1:33:46.240]  they own literally communist Chinese funded and back they own our debt they
[1:33:46.240 --> 1:33:50.960]  own Hollywood I mean we're so far down the rat hole globalism is about selling
[1:33:50.960 --> 1:33:55.720]  out the nation state and so they turn around and then tell those of us that
[1:33:55.720 --> 1:34:00.520]  are trying to reboot the country trying to relaunch things successfully trying
[1:34:00.520 --> 1:34:07.320]  to bring optimism positivity American values they turn around and say we're
[1:34:07.320 --> 1:34:11.560]  bad people we're racist we're this or that we we Alex is getting kicked off the
[1:34:11.560 --> 1:34:16.720]  internet for child endangerment they don't say what I did I showed a viral
[1:34:16.720 --> 1:34:19.800]  video that was all of the news of a kid being pushed the ground after he punches
[1:34:19.800 --> 1:34:25.760]  an adult in the face four times and I said look at this punk kid second SJW
[1:34:25.760 --> 1:34:30.400]  and we showed a bunch of SJW is punching people anti-fab punching women and then
[1:34:30.400 --> 1:34:35.240]  women kicking their ass and they said oh you're glorifying the kid getting
[1:34:35.240 --> 1:34:42.640]  pushed we were illustrating how these are just grown-up little punk kids the
[1:34:42.640 --> 1:34:46.720]  police report came in on that kid he was reportedly going around pushing adults
[1:34:46.720 --> 1:34:50.800]  pushing kids the ground just going crazy because no one would stand up to him and
[1:34:50.800 --> 1:34:54.640]  finally he pushes and hits an adult four times and the adult pushes him to the
[1:34:54.640 --> 1:35:00.520]  ground then he fake cries and gets back up as fine and says you're effing going
[1:35:00.520 --> 1:35:06.000]  to prison which of course he didn't but it it that's the essence of leftist
[1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:11.640]  garbage you read this article at info wars.com and again they shadow ban that
[1:35:11.640 --> 1:35:14.480]  everywhere so you can promote it off news wars.com or prison planet.com they
[1:35:14.480 --> 1:35:18.280]  aren't his band they aren't the big vaunted name that the SJW is recognized
[1:35:18.280 --> 1:35:22.360]  that all run them the media because they've created these people in the
[1:35:22.360 --> 1:35:27.320]  universities and now they've deployed them into into into our daily lives to be
[1:35:27.320 --> 1:35:32.000]  our minders to be our controllers I don't speak Spanish and I've asked people
[1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:35.120]  to speak Spanish what it means and they go that may be some Cuban thing we don't
[1:35:35.120 --> 1:35:40.920]  really know but it's the intro to Scarface and they're saying oh what's
[1:35:40.920 --> 1:35:45.200]  this scar how'd you get that you know what we're in prison for Tony he says
[1:35:45.200 --> 1:35:51.320]  listen I love America my dad was born in America I want the American dream just
[1:35:51.320 --> 1:35:57.560]  like Jimmy Carter says let me in and they say are you a communist and that's
[1:35:57.560 --> 1:36:03.240]  when he blows up and he says am I a communist you want a chavano whatever
[1:36:03.240 --> 1:36:06.160]  that means in Spanish no one can tell me on every corner telling you what to eat
[1:36:06.160 --> 1:36:09.840]  where to sleep what to wear what to do I eat squid three times a day I got
[1:36:09.840 --> 1:36:14.760]  squid coming out my rear end here I want America I want prosperity I want it
[1:36:14.760 --> 1:36:19.880]  now if people want that I say get in here but you want to come here and get a
[1:36:19.880 --> 1:36:23.840]  bunch of free crap and bitch and complain and piss all over everything and say
[1:36:23.840 --> 1:36:28.320]  families are bad and God's bad and men are bad and women are bad everything
[1:36:28.320 --> 1:36:32.120]  that's good's bad everything that's strong's bad they're assaulting us
[1:36:32.120 --> 1:36:37.800]  they're demoralizing us they're attacking us and I'm telling you the system
[1:36:37.800 --> 1:36:41.440]  under Cuba or other North Korea or Venezuela they're bringing that here
[1:36:41.440 --> 1:36:47.840]  folks and they got thugs that openly say on their local websites that if I'm
[1:36:47.840 --> 1:36:54.560]  seen in public and I still go out they're gonna do you know what in America
[1:36:54.560 --> 1:36:59.400]  and then they use the threats of anti-fug against me as an excuse to try to
[1:36:59.400 --> 1:37:04.480]  take my kids right now but I'm not down at the courthouse where they're trying
[1:37:04.480 --> 1:37:09.200]  to take my kids right now God told me stay at the helm of this operation and
[1:37:09.200 --> 1:37:13.720]  move forward no matter what they do and if I get destroyed in the process
[1:37:13.720 --> 1:37:19.960]  politically it's what I'm supposed to do I win by doing the right thing just like
[1:37:19.960 --> 1:37:25.360]  our guest Joey Gibson Joey Gibson for Freedom.com I'm ranting here I want you
[1:37:25.360 --> 1:37:29.560]  to get into the rally coming up you're you're you're awakening why you decided
[1:37:29.560 --> 1:37:36.120]  to do this and and just how Antifa two rallies ago that inspired you to come
[1:37:36.120 --> 1:37:40.240]  out there beat up little kids pepper spray babies and strollers attack women
[1:37:40.240 --> 1:37:43.720]  they always attack people in wheelchairs there's they're like the archetypal
[1:37:43.720 --> 1:37:49.120]  coward we're like they don't even think it's funny that they're such cowards they
[1:37:49.120 --> 1:37:53.360]  think it's cool they attack women and then you guys show up they openly the
[1:37:53.360 --> 1:37:59.680]  news admits attack you we can roll the footage you guys kick their ass each one
[1:37:59.680 --> 1:38:02.320]  of you taking out like 10 of them I mean it's incredible footage it goes on and
[1:38:02.320 --> 1:38:06.480]  on you got to watch it slow motion and then they say we got attacked by Nazis
[1:38:06.480 --> 1:38:11.320]  that attack black people and LGBT and and we're coming out with guns took to
[1:38:11.320 --> 1:38:15.800]  eliminate them I mean they're hitting people in the head with clubs they're
[1:38:15.800 --> 1:38:20.400]  such cowards and then they create this false reality how they need to come out
[1:38:20.400 --> 1:38:24.880]  and eliminate you because you want to exercise the free speech and they say
[1:38:24.880 --> 1:38:30.040]  these lies it's delusional or are they lying to the public or what is the point
[1:38:30.040 --> 1:38:35.160]  of their total deception I don't know what the deals with these guys but I'll
[1:38:35.160 --> 1:38:38.960]  tell you this much is pure hate it's hatred is bigotry they get they're so
[1:38:38.960 --> 1:38:42.800]  disrespectful to people they have no sense of honor and it's all over and
[1:38:42.800 --> 1:38:46.120]  Portland's really bad you know I've been to all the cities around the country
[1:38:46.120 --> 1:38:49.840]  Portland is by far the worst it's one of the worst cities in this country and
[1:38:49.840 --> 1:38:53.440]  it's filled with so much darkness and that's why I'm so motivated to continue
[1:38:53.440 --> 1:38:57.040]  to go in there to expose what it's like there because if we don't go in there
[1:38:57.040 --> 1:39:01.160]  you we don't bring out all this hate onto the streets from from Antifa and the
[1:39:01.160 --> 1:39:05.200]  communists or just people on the far left you know people won't see it because a
[1:39:05.200 --> 1:39:08.320]  lot of their hatred is down behind the scenes where the country won't see it
[1:39:08.320 --> 1:39:11.760]  you know when they dox people they go after you and they just simply just try
[1:39:11.760 --> 1:39:16.600]  to make fun of everybody they disagree with it is insane and it's crazy and so
[1:39:16.600 --> 1:39:19.760]  I'm more than happy to go down there I don't I don't really care what the risks
[1:39:19.760 --> 1:39:22.960]  are I'm happy to go down there and to stand up for freedom and stand up for
[1:39:22.960 --> 1:39:28.680]  God well I'm gonna tell Antifa something we've already been doxing them locally
[1:39:28.680 --> 1:39:32.400]  for about two years and I've been so busy I haven't really moved on them yet
[1:39:32.400 --> 1:39:39.880]  politically but I'm not gonna tell them what we're about to do but very very
[1:39:39.880 --> 1:39:46.800]  soon legal and lawful they are going to get confronted in their workplaces and
[1:39:46.800 --> 1:39:51.600]  where they go to school where they go to college we've had people in their
[1:39:51.600 --> 1:39:57.720]  meetings with the professors you've given us the FBI the FBI has been unable to
[1:39:57.720 --> 1:40:04.000]  act on it so people need to understand this is a true group of violent criminals
[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:09.000]  who lust after killing police officers and the police are so paralyzed they
[1:40:09.000 --> 1:40:14.320]  can't even do anything because the blue cities are run by scumbags well here
[1:40:14.320 --> 1:40:17.880]  here's what we have over them obviously they cover their faces so they they have
[1:40:17.880 --> 1:40:22.440]  no way to motivate and inspire the public because they're faceless they
[1:40:22.440 --> 1:40:25.560]  don't have a leader right they're just soldiers on the streets and so that's
[1:40:25.560 --> 1:40:28.520]  one of the biggest things that we have is we have all these people you know like
[1:40:28.520 --> 1:40:33.160]  Will Johnson or myself or Tusi Toletini we have people who are starting to
[1:40:33.160 --> 1:40:37.560]  become messengers to the public where people can look to and people can can
[1:40:37.560 --> 1:40:40.720]  they can be inspired to come out on the streets it's like a message and it's
[1:40:40.720 --> 1:40:44.960]  really it's real hope it's people being excited to make real change and that's
[1:40:44.960 --> 1:40:49.200]  why people love going into cities like Portland because everybody makes fun of
[1:40:49.200 --> 1:40:53.520]  Portland if you don't live in Portland everybody makes fun of Portland because
[1:40:53.520 --> 1:40:58.080]  of how horrible it is there even the mayor the mayor is a complete joke he
[1:40:58.080 --> 1:41:02.880]  using the police in this political game and he does it to protect and Tifa he
[1:41:02.880 --> 1:41:07.020]  does it to attack ICE officers he doesn't give ICE officers any backing at
[1:41:07.020 --> 1:41:12.360]  all he completely supported the Occupy ICE and it got so bad they had over 70
[1:41:12.360 --> 1:41:16.880]  phone calls to the police over violence over the fact that it was a biohazard it
[1:41:16.880 --> 1:41:21.520]  was they just had to look at what they call it they call it a the ICE calls it
[1:41:21.520 --> 1:41:26.280]  a zone of terror and that's what these blues by the way they admit Portland and
[1:41:26.280 --> 1:41:29.560]  San Francisco now have all their major conferences canceling like all of them
[1:41:29.560 --> 1:41:35.120]  basically because there's so much feces there's just crap everywhere and like
[1:41:35.120 --> 1:41:42.680]  drooling heroin heads and meth heads I mean that these are hell zones yes they
[1:41:42.680 --> 1:41:45.920]  are and if you go down there and you actually look people in the in their
[1:41:45.920 --> 1:41:48.560]  eyes you can see there's something different about them there's something
[1:41:48.560 --> 1:41:52.880]  happening in these cities they are without a doubt spiritual I mean it's
[1:41:52.880 --> 1:41:55.960]  unbelievable but you have to see it for yourselves if you come down to a rally
[1:41:55.960 --> 1:41:59.400]  or a march and you see these people who protest us they're literally foaming
[1:41:59.400 --> 1:42:02.800]  from the mouth we have tons of footage of that that's not a joke like they're
[1:42:02.800 --> 1:42:05.480]  sitting there it looks like they're having a seizure yelling cussing and
[1:42:05.480 --> 1:42:09.240]  screaming you try to have a conversation one of my most favorite things to do is
[1:42:09.240 --> 1:42:12.320]  get this on film try to have a conversation and you ask them questions
[1:42:12.320 --> 1:42:15.760]  they and you challenge the things that they say but they can't back it up they
[1:42:15.760 --> 1:42:19.360]  just start yelling and screaming and cussing and so I think that it's really
[1:42:19.360 --> 1:42:23.400]  important that people see this with their own eyes in person because especially
[1:42:23.400 --> 1:42:26.920]  if you don't live in the area because if we don't stop this now it's gonna take

[1:46:55.320 --> 1:46:58.560]  second american revolution
[1:47:00.240 --> 1:47:05.760]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:47:05.760 --> 1:47:18.800]  what I hate is looking up and seeing chemtrails in a clear blue sky today
[1:47:21.200 --> 1:47:31.160]  what I hate is hitting those blocks on a highway in my way that's a moral
[1:47:31.160 --> 1:47:35.840]  haggard that died last year you know they asked moral haggard in an interview you
[1:47:35.840 --> 1:47:39.880]  pull it up they said did you get them chemtrail things from alex jones and
[1:47:39.880 --> 1:47:44.840]  he's he's more of a old-fashioned liberal but you know a good liberal he said
[1:47:44.840 --> 1:47:48.480]  alex jones and and so they kept interviewing him he got asked about a
[1:47:48.480 --> 1:47:52.640]  couple times on radio too we played the clips years ago and he said listen
[1:47:52.640 --> 1:47:58.240]  don't tell me those are crystal condensation he goes I know you know
[1:47:58.240 --> 1:48:03.640]  about jet airplanes and condensation and the fact that it leaves ice crystals
[1:48:03.640 --> 1:48:08.480]  he goes until about the mid 1990s I never saw the trail sit there for an
[1:48:08.480 --> 1:48:13.080]  hour and I never saw him form at a couple thousand feet I've owned private
[1:48:13.080 --> 1:48:16.920]  jets I know all about him pilots tell me something's going on in the atmosphere
[1:48:16.920 --> 1:48:21.640]  and they admit there's a program it doesn't mean every ice crystal in the
[1:48:21.640 --> 1:48:26.280]  sky is a is a weather modification but they admit it's going on and that's a
[1:48:26.280 --> 1:48:32.000]  fact the CFR admits there's a whole secret Department of Energy program and
[1:48:32.000 --> 1:48:34.200]  see that's why they don't want trump in there because they don't want that stuff
[1:48:34.200 --> 1:48:38.160]  being discussed a separate from that Owen Troyer's here with a great host of the
[1:48:38.160 --> 1:48:43.360]  war room who is going to be out there covering the event coming up what is
[1:48:43.360 --> 1:48:47.920]  this Saturday or this Sunday Joey Gibson again repeat for us with your prayer
[1:48:47.920 --> 1:48:53.120]  vigil why you're doing it where it is and and Owen's gonna be out there yeah
[1:48:53.120 --> 1:48:58.760]  it's Saturday 12 p.m. and Portland Oregon down the waterfront it's called the
[1:48:58.760 --> 1:49:03.120]  salmon Springs now you can go to my Facebook page and get all the details
[1:49:03.120 --> 1:49:07.080]  Patriot prayer look at the event page we also have shuttles they're gonna be
[1:49:07.080 --> 1:49:10.960]  picking people up from Vancouver where the police do their job where they will
[1:49:10.960 --> 1:49:16.400]  be safe and there's not ridiculous gun laws and we have armed buses that will
[1:49:16.400 --> 1:49:19.600]  be going down and dropping people off and that will also be able to pick them
[1:49:19.600 --> 1:49:24.920]  up in any situation even if it's an emergency and I've got Gibson for
[1:49:24.920 --> 1:49:29.320]  freedom calm what's the best side for folks to go to learn about the big pro
[1:49:29.320 --> 1:49:32.960]  free speech event where they say you don't show up in this town we own this
[1:49:32.960 --> 1:49:36.000]  town you don't have free speech Christians or conservatives you sit down
[1:49:36.000 --> 1:49:40.480]  and shut up we're gonna you know we're gonna quote eliminate you again all
[1:49:40.480 --> 1:49:43.760]  intimidation you're calling their bluff and true John Wayne fashion this isn't a
[1:49:43.760 --> 1:49:47.600]  movie though this is the real world folks so be what John Wayne wishes he was and
[1:49:47.600 --> 1:49:50.880]  by the way he was a patriot wouldn't beat up communist himself but the point is
[1:49:50.880 --> 1:49:55.560]  a little inside baseball but Joey Gibson I mean this is this is the point
[1:49:55.560 --> 1:49:59.760]  where do people go right there you can see it on the screen Patriot prayer on
[1:49:59.760 --> 1:50:03.840]  Facebook go to the event page it's a Gibson for Senate free to March this is
[1:50:03.840 --> 1:50:07.960]  a campaign event in Portland and so what we're gonna do is we're basically gonna
[1:50:07.960 --> 1:50:10.880]  make sure that we march and we're gonna protect ourselves we don't expect any
[1:50:10.880 --> 1:50:14.680]  protection from the police the goal is to get the country so outraged that they
[1:50:14.680 --> 1:50:19.560]  put the pressure on the poor the mayor to actually respect the Constitution that
[1:50:19.560 --> 1:50:23.000]  basically that's what we do we put so much pressure on the local politicians
[1:50:23.000 --> 1:50:26.560]  to the point where they break that's right I should have said up front you're
[1:50:26.560 --> 1:50:30.640]  running for US Senate as well so that's that's the campaign site Gibson for
[1:50:30.640 --> 1:50:36.880]  freedom.com yeah absolutely and I think that a lot of people are kind of they
[1:50:36.880 --> 1:50:39.640]  appreciate the fact that I'm a man that's willing to go out on the streets and
[1:50:39.640 --> 1:50:43.060]  put my life on the line and to bring other people in the streets and you know
[1:50:43.060 --> 1:50:46.640]  most politicians they worship the big cities like Portland and Seattle but I'm
[1:50:46.640 --> 1:50:51.640]  kind of saying I stand against it. Well you're certainly doing it you're not
[1:50:51.640 --> 1:50:55.640]  nothing's offensive you know the Southern Poverty Law Center that's got its own
[1:50:55.640 --> 1:50:59.320]  problems with court documents coming out about things I can't even say on air
[1:50:59.320 --> 1:51:04.360]  and young people you know they're claiming you're a violent group they're
[1:51:04.360 --> 1:51:08.040]  claiming you're white supremacist all of it's a complete lie these people are
[1:51:08.040 --> 1:51:14.360]  criminals. Absolutely you know the irony of everything I swear we're living in a
[1:51:14.360 --> 1:51:18.080]  complete era of deception because our group is so diverse even the problies
[1:51:18.080 --> 1:51:22.400]  and Northwest Problies they have so many people of color we have so many people
[1:51:22.400 --> 1:51:29.000]  of color we have women men grandmas you know transsexuals gays. If anything the
[1:51:29.000 --> 1:51:32.760]  liberal media keeps minorities and people from going to Trump rallies when
[1:51:32.760 --> 1:51:36.640]  they go they're like these are the nicest people I've ever seen just come and
[1:51:36.640 --> 1:51:41.800]  see what we're really like. You'll see the life we have spirit we have life we
[1:51:41.800 --> 1:51:45.320]  don't agree on everything but we have fun we enjoy ourselves we're courageous
[1:51:45.320 --> 1:51:48.880]  and we're really passionate it's different something that people are not
[1:51:48.880 --> 1:51:52.360]  experiencing in this life anymore I'm telling you go to one of these rallies
[1:51:52.360 --> 1:51:56.200]  one of these marches your first one you're hooked you're addicted for life
[1:51:56.200 --> 1:51:59.960]  because you will feel the spirit. But what is it whether Hispanic black Asian
[1:51:59.960 --> 1:52:04.400]  old young male female everybody out for liberty looks good they're sharp you
[1:52:04.400 --> 1:52:06.800]  know even their little overweight whatever they have a life they got a
[1:52:06.800 --> 1:52:09.080]  spring in their step and then you look at the other people they're like
[1:52:09.080 --> 1:52:15.920]  slithering caricatures of evil Owen. Well I have been dealing with Antifa for
[1:52:15.920 --> 1:52:20.920]  almost two years now I've had them stop my right to free speech or attempt to
[1:52:20.920 --> 1:52:25.960]  with their rifles that half the left says they want to ban the weapons the
[1:52:25.960 --> 1:52:29.880]  other half uses them to intimidate me out of my right to free speech there's the
[1:52:29.880 --> 1:52:35.080]  video right there so it's just encouraging for me to see not just Joey
[1:52:35.080 --> 1:52:38.200]  Gibson leading this march but other people that have been leading these
[1:52:38.200 --> 1:52:42.880]  marches because this is how we defeat them that you know I don't understand
[1:52:42.880 --> 1:52:48.040]  what drives somebody to go to a park and hold their AR and try to stop someone
[1:52:48.040 --> 1:52:51.720]  else from going in other than some fake news report that makes them think that
[1:52:51.720 --> 1:52:55.760]  they're actually stopping a Nazi so the more we actually show up and show our
[1:52:55.760 --> 1:52:59.880]  faces and say hey look we're not Nazis you know we're just Christians we're
[1:52:59.880 --> 1:53:03.520]  patriots we're Americans these are the values that we preach there's nothing
[1:53:03.520 --> 1:53:07.400]  Nazi here there's no they know you're not that they just think it's like did
[1:53:07.400 --> 1:53:12.400]  you see the article from zero heads no Alex it's like do they listen did you
[1:53:12.400 --> 1:53:17.000]  see where they went two separate times they came out attack black people in
[1:53:17.000 --> 1:53:21.480]  LGBT and viciously attacked us now we're taking guns to the event and we're
[1:53:21.480 --> 1:53:25.640]  going to have to eliminate them to defend the minorities they came out the
[1:53:25.640 --> 1:53:30.240]  tact no it's all even the news admits it even lying news had to admit it and then
[1:53:30.240 --> 1:53:36.280]  they write these total fictions about how you were beating up LGBT what is it
[1:53:36.280 --> 1:53:40.920]  like Joey to just know the I ask you again is this delusion is this upside
[1:53:40.920 --> 1:53:45.480]  down world what the hell are they talking about it's two things there's two
[1:53:45.480 --> 1:53:48.920]  things there's two types of people that protest us number one there's people
[1:53:48.920 --> 1:53:52.720]  they know that that we're not racist they know that we're not fascist but
[1:53:52.720 --> 1:53:56.320]  they're anti-capitalist okay that's a communist section and so they they
[1:53:56.320 --> 1:54:00.040]  riled up the troops with the lies the people that are usually below them okay
[1:54:00.040 --> 1:54:03.200]  and then there's people below them that literally believe in the lies like they
[1:54:03.200 --> 1:54:08.880]  do no research they look at me you know an Asian half Japanese pretty brown dude
[1:54:08.880 --> 1:54:12.240]  they think that I'm a white supremacist and they don't even question it and so
[1:54:12.240 --> 1:54:16.280]  it half of its brainwashing but half of its people trying to use this you know
[1:54:16.280 --> 1:54:19.360]  to further their own political game especially the comments the comments
[1:54:19.360 --> 1:54:23.080]  hate me because I stand for freedom and God and those are the two things they
[1:54:23.080 --> 1:54:27.080]  absolutely despise amen to that we're gonna go to break into five more minutes
[1:54:27.080 --> 1:54:31.120]  with you guys and mark Rondaza one of the top person and lawyers is coming in
[1:54:31.120 --> 1:54:33.740]  here to break down just this total assault but let me tell you they're
[1:54:33.740 --> 1:54:36.320]  building up for something big I want to ask you both what you think that may be
[1:54:36.320 --> 1:54:42.120]  but this is historic everybody needs to go to this event post-haze listen I've
[1:54:42.120 --> 1:54:46.280]  done so many big specials on products that now if I'm not doing specials
[1:54:46.280 --> 1:54:49.760]  people aren't buying products these are already really high quality products
[1:54:49.760 --> 1:54:54.520]  whether it's air filtration water filtration non-gmo heirloom seeds you
[1:54:54.520 --> 1:54:59.760]  name it and I mean we already discount some of the stuff where it hardly makes
[1:54:59.760 --> 1:55:04.520]  any money so we sell a lot of it but it's the cash 22 of then it doesn't make
[1:55:04.520 --> 1:55:07.680]  money to fund the operation we need to raise a lot of money we need people to
[1:55:07.680 --> 1:55:11.280]  commit right now to go to infoworkstore.com and to stand with us to stand
[1:55:11.280 --> 1:55:14.720]  with America to stand with the victories we're having I mean we're the
[1:55:14.720 --> 1:55:20.160]  number one issue other than Trump in the news saying de-platform us shut us down
[1:55:20.160 --> 1:55:24.000]  they're lying about us never showing what we actually said that we need your

[1:57:09.440 --> 1:57:15.280]  and energy and freedom out from that and everything I do is very OCD neurotic I'm
[1:57:15.280 --> 1:57:18.800]  not OCD about carrying the trash out or having you know everything perfect my
[1:57:18.800 --> 1:57:23.920]  life but I'm very OCD about I just I just have to everything I do has to help
[1:57:23.920 --> 1:57:27.480]  other people because I realize I'm building something for me and my family
[1:57:27.480 --> 1:57:31.800]  it's very selfish I'm so selfish I'm the most unselfish person you probably
[1:57:31.800 --> 1:57:35.760]  have me because I'm so selfish I understand like like I don't piss in
[1:57:35.760 --> 1:57:38.200]  the pool because I don't want to swim other people's piss or everybody else
[1:57:38.200 --> 1:57:41.640]  just goes and peas in it it's kind of the same deal I don't crap in the pool

[1:59:59.840 --> 2:00:05.760]  we now take you live to the central texas command center and the heart of
[2:00:05.760 --> 2:00:14.480]  the resistance so we're in a 21st century fifth generation war of media of
[2:00:14.480 --> 2:00:18.760]  resources of brainwashing of intimidation and so you got 10 million
[2:00:18.760 --> 2:00:23.000]  military aged men that already invaded Europe they're burning killing raping
[2:00:23.000 --> 2:00:25.880]  they're allowed to their protected you got the same thing happening out of
[2:00:25.880 --> 2:00:29.680]  Latin America and the juries are saying shoot a woman in the back in cold blood
[2:00:29.680 --> 2:00:33.560]  we're gonna let you go good job this is the signal to bring down the borders are
[2:00:33.560 --> 2:00:38.720]  saying occupy everything bring down the ice offices this is a UN plan to use the
[2:00:38.720 --> 2:00:41.800]  third world to take down the first world it's very very simple they admit the
[2:00:41.800 --> 2:00:46.960]  plan and you look at the invasion footage the new invasion footage hundreds
[2:00:46.960 --> 2:00:51.040]  of these ships in this last few days landing from North Africa funded by
[2:00:51.040 --> 2:00:57.760]  sorrows he admits it he paid for $500 million of those rubber boats to come
[2:00:57.760 --> 2:01:01.720]  in and invade and then we have hours later raping robbing stealing I mean it's
[2:01:01.720 --> 2:01:05.360]  like day of the dead many areas in North Africa the globalist made Libby a
[2:01:05.360 --> 2:01:09.880]  fail blew that open into sub-Saharan Africa opened up a corridor as an
[2:01:09.880 --> 2:01:13.000]  invasion port just like they tried to bring down Syria as the invasion into
[2:01:13.000 --> 2:01:17.880]  Europe but that got stopped this is 21st century warfare and so people need to
[2:01:17.880 --> 2:01:20.600]  understand that they're not going to announce it's happening they're going to
[2:01:20.600 --> 2:01:24.640]  try to suppress all of us that are raising the alarm Joey Gibson Owen
[2:01:24.640 --> 2:01:27.640]  shroyer you've got the big event coming up you're going to be there Owen this
[2:01:27.640 --> 2:01:31.280]  Saturday in Portland high noon everybody should find out more closing
[2:01:31.280 --> 2:01:37.680]  comments Joey and just go with God Viacindios and Owen yeah absolutely I
[2:01:37.680 --> 2:01:40.440]  would say one of the most important things is that we just take a stand show
[2:01:40.440 --> 2:01:43.360]  up stand up for what you believe in that's why I do what I do I just want
[2:01:43.360 --> 2:01:46.760]  to inspire the country for far too long we've kept our heads down you know we've
[2:01:46.760 --> 2:01:50.400]  been hiding for so long and look at where it's gotten us I think that when you
[2:01:50.400 --> 2:01:54.480]  truly find a higher cause you find a purpose a passion that's not about
[2:01:54.480 --> 2:01:58.360]  yourself it's about something bigger than yourselves not only will you really
[2:01:58.360 --> 2:02:01.880]  be making change in this country in this world you'll be the happiest you've ever
[2:02:01.880 --> 2:02:06.320]  felt in your entire life you will feel so much passion you'll have a fire in
[2:02:06.320 --> 2:02:10.720]  your heart and so I'm challenging those of you who are afraid if you just show
[2:02:10.720 --> 2:02:14.440]  up stand up for what you believe in you will change and you'll become a man or
[2:02:14.440 --> 2:02:18.280]  woman that you never thought you can ever be and these antifa are the scum
[2:02:18.280 --> 2:02:21.680]  of the earth cowards and everybody's videotaping what's happening there could
[2:02:21.680 --> 2:02:25.080]  be a provocateur or whatever but but but we're scaring them because we're taking
[2:02:25.080 --> 2:02:29.040]  the field at every level and they know they know their intimidation isn't
[2:02:29.040 --> 2:02:32.240]  working to see though they're cowards so they think intimidation will work on us
[2:02:32.240 --> 2:02:36.240]  they don't know that it only spurs us to take action well the one thing I am
[2:02:36.240 --> 2:02:39.880]  afraid of Alex is what you just said a provocateur being out there somebody
[2:02:39.880 --> 2:02:43.920]  being out there with the going with the mindset that I'm gonna be the first to
[2:02:43.920 --> 2:02:47.000]  fire or I'm gonna be the first to do this or I'm gonna be the one that
[2:02:47.000 --> 2:02:51.600]  escalates things and then they run off into the shadows I don't blame it on
[2:02:51.600 --> 2:02:56.000]  patriots and the thing the thing that's the scariest part about this to me is
[2:02:56.000 --> 2:02:59.640]  that you just won't have any law enforcement that's going to step in and
[2:02:59.640 --> 2:03:03.760]  you won't have any politicians that are willing to step in I know the mayor
[2:03:03.760 --> 2:03:07.280]  that's why we need overwhelming numbers of patriots there yeah and and it looks
[2:03:07.280 --> 2:03:12.120]  like yeah and you first got what a couple hundred method guns you guys are
[2:03:12.120 --> 2:03:15.640]  gonna have thousands right I mean looks good yeah but like I said the real
[2:03:15.640 --> 2:03:19.600]  threat is somebody that gets in there with the mindset that I'm gonna be the
[2:03:19.600 --> 2:03:22.760]  one that escalates these things and I'm gonna slink off into the dark nobody
[2:03:22.760 --> 2:03:25.840]  ever knew I was here and then I'll watch all the news come or or who knows
[2:03:25.840 --> 2:03:28.960]  maybe there's an FBI provocateur there trying to trying to spark this thing off
[2:03:28.960 --> 2:03:34.520]  a leftist operative like reality winner what do you say to that Joey all that's
[2:03:34.520 --> 2:03:37.720]  possible they infiltrate us all the time I will too this much though this time
[2:03:37.720 --> 2:03:42.360]  around we're gonna have a whole bunch of men infiltrating Antifa all black
[2:03:42.360 --> 2:03:46.040]  block amongst them because that's that's their biggest fault okay they don't
[2:03:46.040 --> 2:03:49.520]  know who's who and their crowd so we'll be in there but at the end of the day I'm
[2:03:49.520 --> 2:03:54.080]  just put my faith in God gonna go up there and just do what I can to keep it
[2:03:54.080 --> 2:03:59.120]  as peaceful as we can obviously that's the key sometimes and I commend you both I'm
[2:03:59.120 --> 2:04:04.000]  literally you guys are my hero I mean that what would be sometimes you got to
[2:04:04.000 --> 2:04:07.160]  just square up against evil and let let chips fall where they make well look at
[2:04:07.160 --> 2:04:10.520]  what I mean I'm not trying to compare what we did to civil rights marches in
[2:04:10.520 --> 2:04:13.760]  the Al in Alabama during Martin Luther King's era but there are fair
[2:04:13.760 --> 2:04:16.800]  comparisons to make why did Martin Luther King march in the middle of the
[2:04:16.800 --> 2:04:19.640]  streets why did he march across bridges because they wouldn't let people do it
[2:04:19.640 --> 2:04:23.120]  exactly so he could show the hatred and so he said look all I'm doing as a black
[2:04:23.120 --> 2:04:26.120]  man is marching here look at all the hate we get and so then the nation's
[2:04:26.120 --> 2:04:28.600]  season they're like wow these are real racist this is a problem that's
[2:04:28.600 --> 2:04:31.920]  essentially again I'm not trying to that's why I admire Martin Luther King
[2:04:31.920 --> 2:04:34.800]  as he had courage but so that's what we so it's just like all right we're just
[2:04:34.800 --> 2:04:39.440]  gonna go march and then watch the crazies watch the anti-American whatever's come
[2:04:39.440 --> 2:04:43.400]  out and show how violent and hateful they are well let's get roof you and you
[2:04:43.400 --> 2:04:47.680]  and all the guys back on again Joey Gibson freedom calm running for Senate
[2:04:47.680 --> 2:04:51.280]  everybody get out there oh and you're doing a great job Martin does is coming
[2:04:51.280 --> 2:04:54.160]  with big news thank you so much buddy we'll see you there Joey we'll see there
[2:04:54.160 --> 2:04:59.040]  yeah it's just amazing living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it
[2:04:59.040 --> 2:05:03.960]  really is the real drama can be found here in Leilani estates but a lot of us
[2:05:03.960 --> 2:05:08.200]  on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and
[2:05:08.200 --> 2:05:14.080]  acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could
[2:05:14.080 --> 2:05:18.920]  lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series
[2:05:18.920 --> 2:05:24.880]  of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there was in
[2:05:24.880 --> 2:05:29.760]  fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we
[2:05:29.760 --> 2:05:34.040]  tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the
[2:05:34.040 --> 2:05:39.320]  heavy metal levels within safe measure but the pH was also restored to optimal
[2:05:39.320 --> 2:05:44.880]  levels as it turns out the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water
[2:05:44.880 --> 2:05:49.560]  so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a
[2:05:49.560 --> 2:05:54.440]  rainwater supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will
[2:05:54.440 --> 2:06:04.000]  purify it from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[2:06:07.480 --> 2:06:13.520]  we are fury media nobody said it was going to be easy for us but we will
[2:06:13.520 --> 2:06:21.560]  never be stopped I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created
[2:06:21.560 --> 2:06:27.200]  record low unemployment and a record high stock market the Trump economy is
[2:06:27.200 --> 2:06:29.760]  red-hot
[2:06:31.160 --> 2:06:37.040]  rocket man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime they will be
[2:06:37.040 --> 2:06:42.560]  met with fire and fury like the world has never seen now Kim Jong-un says
[2:06:42.560 --> 2:06:47.240]  President Trump will pay dearly for those words
[2:06:57.080 --> 2:07:03.920]  North Korea now committing to complete denuclearization I mean it's truly
[2:07:03.920 --> 2:07:08.520]  remarkable what he's doing he has done more than any president in recent
[2:07:08.520 --> 2:07:17.320]  history certainly in the last half century he's not a politician he's one
[2:07:17.320 --> 2:07:26.080]  of us never ever ever give up
[2:07:26.080 --> 2:07:31.960]  never stop fighting for what you believe in and for the people who care about you
[2:07:31.960 --> 2:07:40.760]  carry yourself with dignity and pride relish the opportunity to be an
[2:07:40.760 --> 2:07:47.280]  outsider embrace that label because it's the outsiders who change the world and
[2:07:47.280 --> 2:07:54.760]  who make a real and lasting difference treat the word impossible as nothing
[2:07:54.760 --> 2:08:01.560]  more than motivation three American hostages are back home I am asked all
[2:08:01.560 --> 2:08:06.760]  citizens to embrace this renewal of the American spirit seize this moment
[2:08:06.760 --> 2:08:14.640]  believe in yourselves believe in your future and believe once more in America
[2:08:14.640 --> 2:08:25.520]  I will fight for you with every breath in my body and I will never ever let you
[2:08:25.520 --> 2:08:35.400]  down the forgotten man and the forgotten woman you're not forgotten anymore a lot
[2:08:35.400 --> 2:08:39.320]  of his supporters believe that we are the enemy of the American people and
[2:08:39.320 --> 2:08:43.800]  that is a really really an awful situation we are not the enemy of the
[2:08:43.800 --> 2:08:47.600]  American people we love the American people
[2:08:56.460 --> 2:09:01.520]  but we are not the enemy of the people we love the American people we love the
[2:09:01.520 --> 2:09:06.520]  American people. We love the American people.
[2:09:06.520 --> 2:09:08.520]  They came in peace.
[2:09:08.520 --> 2:09:24.520]  We are not the enemy of the American people. We love the American people.
[2:09:31.520 --> 2:09:33.520]  This is CNN.
[2:09:33.520 --> 2:09:41.520]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are in the resistance.
[2:09:49.520 --> 2:09:57.520]  You know, I really don't know what to say at this point.
[2:09:57.520 --> 2:10:04.520]  I just know that the last thing we play at the establishment doesn't like you seeing success.
[2:10:04.520 --> 2:10:07.520]  So we are going to play a special report right now.
[2:10:07.520 --> 2:10:20.520]  And then we are going to come back with our guest in studio to get into the mega epic attack on free speech that is taking place right now.
[2:10:20.520 --> 2:10:28.520]  Because I don't have enough hype to accurately break down how big this is or how serious this is.
[2:10:28.520 --> 2:10:35.520]  But myself included, everyone kind of gets in this haze where we've never seen something like this before.
[2:10:35.520 --> 2:10:40.520]  We've never dealt with something like this. So we all just kind of take it on the chin.
[2:10:40.520 --> 2:10:42.520]  You can't take this on the chin.
[2:10:42.520 --> 2:10:48.520]  I sent a report to the president that I know he read, that I know was delivered in his hands.
[2:10:48.520 --> 2:10:52.520]  Days before he came out and said, I've got a lot of reports about shadow banning, very criminal.
[2:10:52.520 --> 2:10:56.520]  We're going to stop it. That's just the beginning.
[2:10:56.520 --> 2:11:00.520]  For Annette Marc Rondas, one of the top First Amendment lawyers in the country, definitely the bravest.
[2:11:00.520 --> 2:11:04.520]  You know, the world of cowards, you know, not being a coward makes you a superman.
[2:11:04.520 --> 2:11:06.520]  No one else even take her case or she'll happen.
[2:11:06.520 --> 2:11:08.520]  He is one of the top First Amendment lawyers. I'm not the top.
[2:11:08.520 --> 2:11:13.520]  But I want to get into this important report here.
[2:11:13.520 --> 2:11:17.520]  And the M4 reaches historic proportions.
[2:11:17.520 --> 2:11:20.520]  Then we're going to get into Barbie wearing a jib.
[2:11:20.520 --> 2:11:23.520]  And people being arrested for kissing their fiance's in Saudi Arabia.
[2:11:23.520 --> 2:11:25.520]  But the left just thinks it's great.
[2:11:25.520 --> 2:11:27.520]  The petition to Donald Trump pardoned Julian Assange.
[2:11:27.520 --> 2:11:29.520]  It's all coming up at first.
[2:11:29.520 --> 2:11:32.520]  Here is the M4 reaches historic proportions.
[2:11:32.520 --> 2:11:35.520]  They're making their move.
[2:11:35.520 --> 2:11:38.520]  Not just against M4s, but against everybody.
[2:11:38.520 --> 2:11:40.520]  And it's not just ahead of the midterms.
[2:11:40.520 --> 2:11:44.520]  It's a global crackdown on free speech.
[2:11:44.520 --> 2:11:50.520]  And they're very brazen about who's helping them do it, who's on showing.
[2:11:50.520 --> 2:11:53.520]  And it's so historical. History is happening now.
[2:11:53.520 --> 2:11:58.520]  This is outrageous tyranny. It's extremely naked.
[2:11:58.520 --> 2:12:03.520]  And it operates like you're completely unconscious.
[2:12:03.520 --> 2:12:05.520]  A brave new world is here.
[2:12:05.520 --> 2:12:07.520]  It is the establishment plan.
[2:12:07.520 --> 2:12:11.520]  And we are here simply trying to ring the alarm bell and expose it.
[2:12:11.520 --> 2:12:15.520]  Because the information is so on target about the globalist program,
[2:12:15.520 --> 2:12:18.520]  because it's from their own admissions, they were so arrogant,
[2:12:18.520 --> 2:12:21.520]  they bragged about for decades.
[2:12:21.520 --> 2:12:26.520]  They're scared of this broadcast and they want it shut down.
[2:12:26.520 --> 2:12:29.520]  They're obsessed with knocking it out.
[2:12:29.520 --> 2:12:34.520]  If you looked at the amount of demonization attacks on M4s in the last 23 years,
[2:12:34.520 --> 2:12:40.520]  it starts out as a trickle and then just exponentially goes up by 2016
[2:12:40.520 --> 2:12:47.520]  and then goes into stratospheric straight-up convulsions in the last six months.
[2:12:47.520 --> 2:12:56.520]  And now, tens of thousands of articles, news programs, local shows, fake letters to the editor.
[2:12:56.520 --> 2:13:00.520]  An article posted to Slate.com describes this as a strike against a channel.
[2:13:00.520 --> 2:13:05.520]  Ms. Downs, how many strikes does a channel get?
[2:13:05.520 --> 2:13:09.520]  Typically, a channel gets three strikes and then we terminate the channel.
[2:13:09.520 --> 2:13:14.520]  So, the reason I ask is Alex Jones, obviously, is a well-known conspiracy theorist
[2:13:14.520 --> 2:13:17.520]  whose brand is bullying.
[2:13:17.520 --> 2:13:23.520]  He launched similar attacks against the families whose six and seven-year-old kids were slaughtered at Sandy Hook.
[2:13:23.520 --> 2:13:24.520]  And he's not the only one.
[2:13:24.520 --> 2:13:29.520]  Truthers have spread these lies claiming that Sandy Hook never happened at all.
[2:13:29.520 --> 2:13:34.520]  In a Slate article, a reference is a study by Jonathan Albright, director of the Tau Center for Digital Journalism
[2:13:34.520 --> 2:13:39.520]  in Columbia, who found 9,000 videos on YouTube with titles that are, and I quote,
[2:13:39.520 --> 2:13:44.520]  a mixture of shocking, vile, and promotional themes that include rape game jokes,
[2:13:44.520 --> 2:13:48.520]  shock reality social experiments, celebrity pedophilia, false flag rants,
[2:13:48.520 --> 2:13:54.520]  and terror-related conspiracy theories dating back to the Oklahoma City attacks in 1995.
[2:13:54.520 --> 2:14:03.520]  The entire leftist deep state, the entire foundation combined, is launching attacks on info wars.
[2:14:03.520 --> 2:14:10.520]  The likes of which you only see before the country is tricked into invading some third-world country.
[2:14:10.520 --> 2:14:15.520]  It's war-level propaganda.
[2:14:15.520 --> 2:14:23.520]  But see, info wars has been chosen as the test case for everybody else's speech to be taken.
[2:14:23.520 --> 2:14:25.520]  And we've worked really hard.
[2:14:25.520 --> 2:14:36.520]  The listeners have pushed really hard to get information into Congress's hands.
[2:14:36.520 --> 2:14:42.520]  And Congress has now seen the reports that we and others have put together detailing all of this.
[2:14:42.520 --> 2:14:49.520]  So we have a real fighting chance to get them educated about algorithms and shadow bands
[2:14:49.520 --> 2:14:55.520]  and community guidelines that are really run by the Southern Primary Law Center where they can say,
[2:14:55.520 --> 2:15:01.520]  very, very subjectively, just up to them what they say is offensive and what isn't.
[2:15:01.520 --> 2:15:10.520]  And then the key is misrepresent what you said or done and not even show what you say or do that they claim is wrong.
[2:15:10.520 --> 2:15:15.520]  I mean, clearly you're covering up the First Amendment already, but then they misrepresent what you say,
[2:15:15.520 --> 2:15:20.520]  move it, and then never show you what it is you supposedly said.
[2:15:20.520 --> 2:15:30.520]  Over 10,000 articles in the last four days in a Google search with the headline Alex Jones bullying Alex Jones child endangerment.
[2:15:30.520 --> 2:15:38.520]  So that's what they do, ladies and gentlemen. That's how they kill the truth. That's how they murder it.
[2:15:38.520 --> 2:15:48.520]  Beyond info wars, they're getting ready to make their big move.
[2:15:48.520 --> 2:15:55.520]  All right, folks, we're going to break and we'll be back with Mark Rondazza with how they're trying to rob your most sacred of rights.

[2:18:21.520 --> 2:18:37.520]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever that everyone go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[2:18:37.520 --> 2:18:45.520]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the InfoWars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[2:18:45.520 --> 2:19:08.520]  But the bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter. We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[2:19:15.520 --> 2:19:31.520]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[2:19:31.520 --> 2:19:48.520]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[2:19:48.520 --> 2:20:06.520]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world. Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Field and InfoWarsLive.com.
[2:20:18.520 --> 2:20:24.520]  This is Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[2:20:24.520 --> 2:20:35.520]  Okay, so we've done it. We have forced the debate into Congress. The President has pointed out that shadow banning is discriminatory illegal. That is a donation in kind of the Democratic Party when they do it.
[2:20:35.520 --> 2:20:50.520]  It's all happening, but the hoax goes like this. Alex Jones is suspended on YouTube from live streaming for bullying and child endangerment, Islamophobia and transphobia.
[2:20:50.520 --> 2:21:03.520]  Then they don't show the videos, they just say it. How Kafka asks is that in thousands of articles. Then Forbes takes it and says that I beat a kid up but doesn't say where the town was, what the kid's name was, who the parents, basic journalism.
[2:21:03.520 --> 2:21:15.520]  None of that's true. So I'm saying is media has gone from super fake to ultra fake. And here's an article. Facebook and YouTube have restricted Alex Jones and InfoWars Spotify hasn't and people are upset.
[2:21:15.520 --> 2:21:23.520]  So off of that, they want this deep platforming because we just launched on Spotify. We're already raising to the top. We just launched a free app last week.
[2:21:23.520 --> 2:21:33.520]  Two weeks ago, it's already gone to the top 20 now of news apps with hundreds of thousands downloading and InfoWars.com, people are sharing it.
[2:21:33.520 --> 2:21:39.520]  InfoWars founder Alex Jones said with temporary Facebook suspension, reportedly on the brink of being banned entirely. New York Daily News.
[2:21:39.520 --> 2:21:47.520]  Well, New York Daily News is laid off after employees. So you're being banned by going bankrupt. Continuing. Spotify is hosting and that's what this is.
[2:21:47.520 --> 2:21:56.520]  They're collapsing. They want to claw us into the grave with them. Spotify is hosting Alex Jones InfoWars podcast after YouTube and Facebook bans.
[2:21:56.520 --> 2:22:04.520]  The outrage of users. Wow, the users. It's like, I don't like this type of music. Let me go get it banned. And then they lie about what it is.
[2:22:04.520 --> 2:22:13.520]  Facebook and YouTube have restricted Alex Jones and InfoWars. Spotify hasn't and people are upset. Vox. It's the same article. Thousands of them a day.
[2:22:13.520 --> 2:22:22.520]  Spotify users threatened to court over InfoWars podcast. Oh, yeah. So this is, they don't have jobs, little SJWs. They just want me taken off.
[2:22:22.520 --> 2:22:28.520]  Mark Rondaza is one of the top First Amendment lawyers out there. He's representing me in cases we're not getting into here on air.
[2:22:28.520 --> 2:22:36.520]  But we got Antifa on the street saying we can't have a demonstration. We've got the left trying to de-platform, getting caught blocking all these Republican shadow bans.
[2:22:36.520 --> 2:22:44.520]  I think they're pushing too far into the midterms. And I think they've gone from the ignorant Republicans not knowing what's happening to really getting informed.
[2:22:44.520 --> 2:22:48.520]  I think they're really starting to trigger their own downfall. What do you think?
[2:22:48.520 --> 2:22:59.520]  Look, I'm old enough to remember when the left promoted free speech. And when I see this kind of conduct, people are upset and they want to get rid of you.
[2:22:59.520 --> 2:23:05.520]  I got a great way to do that. Just stop listening. Don't watch. I mean, that was our argument back.
[2:23:05.520 --> 2:23:08.520]  But the problem is we're left alone. We're number one.
[2:23:08.520 --> 2:23:15.520]  Well, you know, that's the thing. They seem to have gone after you because of your effectiveness in drawing out voters for the right.
[2:23:15.520 --> 2:23:21.520]  And look, if that's your political persuasion and you're communicating with people, the marketplace of ideas is responding.
[2:23:21.520 --> 2:23:25.520]  Let's be clear. I was never a big Republican booster. I like Trump because he's a populist.
[2:23:25.520 --> 2:23:32.520]  Right. Well, you know, but you got people out to vote for him. And now these people who are freaking out still over the election,
[2:23:32.520 --> 2:23:38.520]  you know, they really cannot simply take defeat lying down. I mean, they're not taking it in any way.
[2:23:38.520 --> 2:23:45.520]  But if you don't like Alex Jones, then click away. Go read something else. Go listen to something else. Go watch something else.
[2:23:45.520 --> 2:23:50.520]  That's easy. You know, this was the argument I have made when I've defended pornography.
[2:23:50.520 --> 2:23:54.520]  You know, if you don't like it, don't watch it. When, you know, I remember back even.
[2:23:54.520 --> 2:23:57.520]  But we know the people that bash it the most are the biggest consumers.
[2:23:57.520 --> 2:24:05.520]  Well, you know, that that when it comes to pornography, yes, I mean, there's there's always I don't I don't think there's people who like closet Alex Jones
[2:24:05.520 --> 2:24:13.520]  Watchers who are screaming, we should shut him down. Yes, in my in my experience, when I've gone into very conservative communities that have tried to
[2:24:13.520 --> 2:24:21.520]  ban pornography, ban pornography shops, ban strip clubs. Yeah, those guys at the City Council meetings, I will say are probably some of the biggest
[2:24:21.520 --> 2:24:23.520]  perverts you'll ever meet.
[2:24:23.520 --> 2:24:28.520]  But you know, that's let's just a paradox whether because it's a free will universe.
[2:24:28.520 --> 2:24:32.520]  If somebody's an adult, they want to hurt themselves. A lot of the stuff's really bad, really degrading.
[2:24:32.520 --> 2:24:38.520]  I personally think, you know, porn takes the joy out of life. It has big problems, but at the same time, it's a free country.
[2:24:38.520 --> 2:24:44.520]  So yeah, so why why would you take any kind of communication out of the marketplace of ideas?
[2:24:44.520 --> 2:24:47.520]  Yeah, prove it in courts, which they're trying to sue me over it, which they can do.
[2:24:47.520 --> 2:24:52.520]  But they're acting like like like the Mueller and the indictments like the indictments, the proof.
[2:24:52.520 --> 2:25:00.520]  Oh, he's been sued. Shut him off. Right. Well, you know, yeah, it just seems to have this, you know, if I mean, I realize not very many people
[2:25:00.520 --> 2:25:05.520]  want to shut you down or watching this. But maybe some of these journalists who are writing about you might be watching this.
[2:25:05.520 --> 2:25:11.520]  And are you really so afraid of the ideas you see here that your ideas cannot stand in opposition to them?
[2:25:11.520 --> 2:25:17.520]  I mean, that is what, you know, ever since Oliver Wendell Holmes penned this in Abrams versus United States.
[2:25:17.520 --> 2:25:26.520]  And he said that that is the theory of our Constitution. We allow the marketplace of ideas to determine whether or not we accept that idea or reject it.
[2:25:26.520 --> 2:25:33.520]  There is plenty of room for this. And they aren't succeeding in the market of ideas, so they want to shut the market down.
[2:25:33.520 --> 2:25:38.520]  Well, that's that's when I get my hackles up. I mean, I don't care if it's somebody I agree with or not.
[2:25:38.520 --> 2:25:45.520]  In fact, if it's somebody I disagree with, I'm just as forceful in trying to protect their right to participate in that marketplace.
[2:25:45.520 --> 2:25:49.520]  Because without these dissenting voices, without somebody.
[2:25:49.520 --> 2:25:55.520]  Sure, exactly. But they've made the decision. They when the left wasn't the power, they were all for the free speech.
[2:25:55.520 --> 2:26:02.520]  Now they are the power. They are super Soviet. They want everything. We have all these so-called well, Jones isn't news.
[2:26:02.520 --> 2:26:07.520]  We define him as fake. So we say ban him. OK, well, it isn't just news that has free speech.
[2:26:07.520 --> 2:26:11.520]  Say I'm fake, which I'm not. You create a fake straw man, then say ban me.
[2:26:11.520 --> 2:26:15.520]  But they're they're they're going after us desperately.
[2:26:15.520 --> 2:26:21.520]  And I think it should be the big campaign issue of 2018 and 2020.
[2:26:21.520 --> 2:26:26.520]  And by the way, to the horror of Google Facebook and Twitter, Trump is about to make it a big campaign issue.
[2:26:26.520 --> 2:26:33.520]  So stick that in your, you know what, because you mess with me. You are about to reap the whirlwind, bitches.
[2:26:33.520 --> 2:26:39.520]  Well, look, I just wish that while, you know, while people are fighting for free speech, when it's their side that needs it,
[2:26:39.520 --> 2:26:46.520]  they remember those fights. You know, I remember when NPR was under attack and conservatives wanted to defund them,
[2:26:46.520 --> 2:26:52.520]  despite the fact that we'd made a commitment to NPR being out there and they tend to be very liberal.
[2:26:52.520 --> 2:26:59.520]  You know, I was not happy when I saw the government, when I saw people on the right in the government trying to defund that.
[2:26:59.520 --> 2:27:02.520]  I said, you know what, so what? There's plenty of counter speech out there.
[2:27:02.520 --> 2:27:09.520]  And now, yeah, the polarity flips and we've got people who want to shut you down, shut down other voices on the right,
[2:27:09.520 --> 2:27:12.520]  simply because they don't like the ideas being expressed.
[2:27:12.520 --> 2:27:14.520]  Don't watch, don't read.
[2:27:14.520 --> 2:27:21.520]  And when I see somebody criticizing speech, I always ask them, well, did you go to the primary source?
[2:27:21.520 --> 2:27:23.520]  Did you actually see what this person said?
[2:27:23.520 --> 2:27:28.520]  Or are you simply reading a news article about a news article about a news article?
[2:27:28.520 --> 2:27:34.520]  And by the time I actually get to the primary source, often what's being reported on is not...
[2:27:34.520 --> 2:27:39.520]  Well, that's our strategy coming up with Sandy Hook. We don't want to get into it, but we didn't say and do the things they said.
[2:27:39.520 --> 2:27:44.520]  And they're the ones claiming this is hurtful that are republishing a lie I didn't say.
[2:27:44.520 --> 2:27:52.520]  And that's what's crazy about this is, as you just said, in literally 10,000 articles plus the last week about me,
[2:27:52.520 --> 2:27:57.520]  because they republish them everywhere, they never show what I said.
[2:27:57.520 --> 2:27:59.520]  Isn't that a telltale sign?
[2:27:59.520 --> 2:28:04.520]  Jones beat up a kid. He's being banned off the Internet. It didn't happen. How outrageous is that?
[2:28:04.520 --> 2:28:09.520]  You know, I find it very journalistically irresponsible. You're a public figure.
[2:28:09.520 --> 2:28:17.520]  They cannot knowing, even you, they can't defame you by knowingly publishing falsehoods or having a reckless disregard for the truth.
[2:28:17.520 --> 2:28:25.520]  But even that, I wish people would look at journalism and require some level of critical thinking.
[2:28:25.520 --> 2:28:27.520]  I agree, but listen, no one else...
[2:28:27.520 --> 2:28:32.520]  When Tiger Woods got in trouble, it wasn't this much coverage. I mean, it's every damn...
[2:28:32.520 --> 2:28:37.520]  I'm going to ask you when we come back. What do you think they're doing? I mean, I'm not that powerful.
[2:28:37.520 --> 2:28:41.520]  It is Alex Jones' obsession. Every local TV station all over the country.
[2:28:41.520 --> 2:28:46.520]  It's national news. Every newspaper. Alex Jones, Alex Jones, Alex Jones.
[2:28:46.520 --> 2:28:55.520]  I mean, what in the hell is going on? We'll talk to Mark Rondaza straight ahead, infowars.com, newswars.com, tomorrow's news today.

[2:30:52.520 --> 2:31:15.520]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books or videos or other material from infowarstore.com, you are funding the revolution.

[2:33:15.520 --> 2:33:22.520]  For more information, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[2:33:22.520 --> 2:33:51.520]  Mark Rondaza is our guest, top First Amendment lawyer, also represents me in some cases. Mark, you hear me ranting about this. I don't want to make this Gonzo journalism.
[2:33:51.520 --> 2:33:59.520]  I've got incredible stories on so many fronts here, literally hundreds of them I don't get to that are on Infowars.com and NewsWars.com.
[2:33:59.520 --> 2:34:09.520]  But one of the top stories in the country for four months is ban Alex Jones, then misrepresent what I say and do, and then never show it.
[2:34:09.520 --> 2:34:22.520]  And before we went live, I kind of stole your thunder and got into all that. You made the point that when we actually published the videos that YouTube took down, they didn't show what we, as if they should have took them down for what they claimed, but they shouldn't have done that.
[2:34:22.520 --> 2:34:24.520]  But it wasn't even what they said, sure.
[2:34:24.520 --> 2:34:44.520]  Because they are trying to silence people that can help get out the vote or get people to start thinking conservative thought. That's what this war is. And I would encourage, I know a lot of people are watching and listening, and I would encourage you to understand that these people want to shut you down.
[2:34:44.520 --> 2:34:54.520]  These people want to shut Alex down. To them, this is an obsession, and you need to be obsessed with free speech as well.
[2:34:54.520 --> 2:34:56.520]  You just said it's a religion now.
[2:34:56.520 --> 2:35:01.520]  Right, but you need to have your own religion. Now, luckily, that religion is already there for you.
[2:35:01.520 --> 2:35:05.520]  Like you said, your religion is America. Explain that. Start over, interrupt it, start over.
[2:35:05.520 --> 2:35:16.520]  It's called the Constitution. You need to have your own religious fervor. And I'm not saying to be Alex Jones fans, I'm saying to be fans of freedom of expression, freedom of speech.
[2:35:16.520 --> 2:35:25.520]  If you want this principle to survive, I would encourage anybody here, when you see these kinds of stories, you know, don't write unglued, crazy things in.
[2:35:25.520 --> 2:35:34.520]  Listen, I'm going to stop you. I'm going to edit this later and put it out as an ad. Start over with your preface and how it's a religion and what they're doing. Start over.
[2:35:34.520 --> 2:35:41.520]  Look, the way people are attacking you and attacking other people on the right is with a religious fervor.
[2:35:41.520 --> 2:35:50.520]  You need to have your own religious fervor in favor of freedom of expression. And when I say that, I don't mean just when you see it's Alex Jones.
[2:35:50.520 --> 2:35:56.520]  When you see anybody that they're trying to eliminate from the marketplace of ideas, do something, say something.
[2:35:56.520 --> 2:36:07.520]  When you write in to Facebook and heck, write to Facebook and Spotify. These idiots are doing it. You write to them and say, I may not like Alex Jones or I do like Alex Jones either way.
[2:36:07.520 --> 2:36:17.520]  But I want this marketplace of ideas to be wide open and robust. And I would tell you, when you hear somebody trying to suppress speech that you don't like, do the same thing.
[2:36:17.520 --> 2:36:24.520]  Because if we can expand the circle of people who believe in freedom of expression and who will stand up for it, America is better.
[2:36:24.520 --> 2:36:32.520]  That is the idea of America. That's the principle of our Constitution. There's nothing else. We're nothing else without that.
[2:36:32.520 --> 2:36:43.520]  And you've got these people who are screaming to limit liberty, to limit freedom of expression and asking these monopolistic companies to join in on the fun.
[2:36:43.520 --> 2:36:54.520]  Don't let them do that because you are going to find if you do like or you don't like Alex Jones or you do like or you don't like Ann Coulter or anybody else that you might have a problem with.
[2:36:54.520 --> 2:37:03.520]  Let me tell you, once these companies see that this is okay, that the American people will stand for this kind of censorship based on content, you know what?
[2:37:03.520 --> 2:37:13.520]  Something that you like is eventually going to get targeted and we're going to be corralled into just a narrow area of speech that's good enough for who?
[2:37:13.520 --> 2:37:23.520]  That's good enough for just Mark Zuckerberg and just good enough for Jack Dorsey. You're going to have five people sitting in the 650 area code deciding what is your marketplace.
[2:37:23.520 --> 2:37:24.520]  And Rupert Murdoch.
[2:37:24.520 --> 2:37:25.520]  And what is it?
[2:37:25.520 --> 2:37:26.520]  He's involved in this.
[2:37:26.520 --> 2:37:37.520]  You know, you can't have that. You cannot have a free society like that. So if you're demanding freedom from being offended, you're not living up to the standards of what this country is supposed to be.
[2:37:37.520 --> 2:37:44.520]  If you're demanding a marketplace of ideas and then heck, demand that people denounce what Alex Jones has to say.
[2:37:44.520 --> 2:37:49.520]  I don't have a problem with that. If people were protesting outside here right now, I don't think you'd have a problem with that.
[2:37:49.520 --> 2:37:50.520]  No.
[2:37:50.520 --> 2:37:57.520]  If people were protesting outside out here and the cops tried to stop them, I'd get a conflict waiver from you and ask if I can defend them and I bet you'd let me.
[2:37:57.520 --> 2:37:58.520]  Exactly.
[2:37:58.520 --> 2:38:00.520]  Mark, Mark, I would 1000% do that.
[2:38:00.520 --> 2:38:14.520]  That's how we have to look at freedom of expression. Protect it for people you like, protect it for people you don't like, but make it as important to you as it is to these people who are completely deranged about shutting down speech they don't like.
[2:38:14.520 --> 2:38:24.520]  Sit down. If you have not written an email or a letter to Facebook or Spotify or Twitter saying, you know, I'm kind of sick of this and I want to see a robust marketplace of ideas.
[2:38:24.520 --> 2:38:25.520]  I thought I lived in America.
[2:38:25.520 --> 2:38:28.520]  Well, you do, but you know, this is what they should say.
[2:38:28.520 --> 2:38:41.520]  Let harness the marketplace of ideas and harness freedom of expression. If there's millions of people listening right now, if 1% of you sent sent letters or emails to Facebook, Twitter, Spotify, your local press saying I want a robust market.
[2:38:41.520 --> 2:38:43.520]  Those are even more important than Internet comments.
[2:38:43.520 --> 2:38:44.520]  That would do something.
[2:38:44.520 --> 2:38:47.520]  Because they're trying to get rid of Internet comments because they know those are more popular in the articles.
[2:38:47.520 --> 2:38:52.520]  Exactly. Your personal phone call, your contact, your email you send has a huge effect on this.
[2:38:52.520 --> 2:38:55.520]  This is a war, but going back to this, Mark, because you're a great lawyer, constitutional guy.
[2:38:55.520 --> 2:38:58.520]  Let me get your take on this. Mark Rondazzo here in studio with us.
[2:38:58.520 --> 2:39:04.520]  Because this is America's fight. They're going for the First Amendment when they set the president to de-platform me. They're going to do it for everybody.
[2:39:04.520 --> 2:39:14.520]  I would actually admit that even in the Wall Street Journal of the New York Times. So this is a big, historic thing, you know, that the university is suing me with this info, as you know.
[2:39:14.520 --> 2:39:16.520]  They say they're attempting to change the First Amendment.
[2:39:16.520 --> 2:39:27.520]  So what about the issue of they use the First Amendment, and then I'm a public figure, to defame and lie about me, and then they don't want me to be able to respond?
[2:39:27.520 --> 2:39:36.520]  That's why that's so fundamental. And it shows how unpowerful they are that they've got 10,000 plus articles. Every major news show lying about me.
[2:39:36.520 --> 2:39:47.520]  They won't show the proof of what they said. And so, so again, I mean, I'm just wondering how does that mix into this as a legal issue that they're trying to silence me while they lie about me?
[2:39:47.520 --> 2:39:50.520]  Well, look, I mean, you know, the First Amendment cuts both ways.
[2:39:50.520 --> 2:39:57.520]  So if they want to mischaracterize what you've said, that still might be protected content under the First Amendment.
[2:39:57.520 --> 2:40:05.520]  But there's a way we push back on that. You know, there are, if you look at any one of these articles, and when I've clicked through, I mean, people will...
[2:40:05.520 --> 2:40:08.520]  They never show me saying what they claim.
[2:40:08.520 --> 2:40:14.520]  Well, that's every time somebody comes to me and says, how can you represent that guy after what he said?
[2:40:14.520 --> 2:40:21.520]  And they send me an article talking about what you said. And I say, all right, show me him saying that. And I'll listen to you.
[2:40:21.520 --> 2:40:27.520]  And you've now spent a lot of hours going to what I actually said. We don't want to get into our defenses here. But is it what they claim?
[2:40:27.520 --> 2:40:38.520]  Look, I have not seen accurate reporting yet on what you've said. You know, anybody who has a hit piece on you, I have not yet seen them back it up.
[2:40:38.520 --> 2:40:46.520]  Colbert hides behind entertainment and then he plays clips, edited me saying, I'm not anti-gay. And the clip is, I'm anti-gay.
[2:40:46.520 --> 2:40:54.520]  He edits it. And if I wanted to be anti-gay, I'm an American, I can do that. But I wasn't even anti, but they edited it to defame me.
[2:40:54.520 --> 2:41:00.520]  I mean, that's what I'm saying. The level of how they've killed journalism, these journalism schools, you're alma mater suing me.
[2:41:00.520 --> 2:41:04.520]  Georgetown has turned into an engine of anti-free speech. What do we do about that?
[2:41:04.520 --> 2:41:14.520]  Look, you know, I found Georgetown when I attended there to be not the greatest bastion of protecting freedom of speech.
[2:41:14.520 --> 2:41:22.520]  I found a lot of people there that had theories that said that, you know, we need freedom from freedom. I mean, then put it quite that way.
[2:41:22.520 --> 2:41:30.520]  But we, you know, perhaps the First Amendment is a terrible thing because freedom of speech is, it does not promote the values we want.
[2:41:30.520 --> 2:41:36.520]  And I was just horrified because when I got there, I thought I was a liberal, you know, until I got there.
[2:41:36.520 --> 2:41:44.520]  And then all of a sudden I start finding myself only hanging out at the Federalist Society meetings because, you know, and I still believe in a lot of liberalism.
[2:41:44.520 --> 2:41:51.520]  But that's how I've always felt. Like, I'm all for people to have their own freedom. I'm a libertarian. How is this new Orthodox left the liberals?
[2:41:51.520 --> 2:41:57.520]  They're not. They're very, we're going to control the words you say and we're going to, everything's bad and we're going to rename the Austin.
[2:41:57.520 --> 2:42:00.520]  And it's like, what kind of cult did I wake up in?
[2:42:00.520 --> 2:42:08.520]  Well, you know, the problem is that you have these people who are that obsessed. This is the most important thing in the world.
[2:42:08.520 --> 2:42:19.520]  You know, like when I would say defend a strip club in a community that in people would come and protest and show up at county commission meetings and say, we need to shut this down.
[2:42:19.520 --> 2:42:22.520]  These were people for whom it was the most important thing in the world.
[2:42:22.520 --> 2:42:26.520]  The people occasionally went to the place. They weren't going to come out and protest.
[2:42:26.520 --> 2:42:28.520]  Like you said, they pulled guns on you.
[2:42:28.520 --> 2:42:30.520]  That did happen. Yeah. I mean, the only time.
[2:42:30.520 --> 2:42:36.520]  So now we've got to that point where it's not even real, like they'll say, oh, there's prostitution in there and it's not even happening.
[2:42:36.520 --> 2:42:43.520]  It's like, it's exactly they like, it becomes this whole, but now the left has become like this weird Orthodox crazy game.
[2:42:43.520 --> 2:42:48.520]  And, you know, my fear is I see people on the right adopting the same thing again.
[2:42:48.520 --> 2:42:54.520]  And that's the big problem. Let's talk about how the globalists can win getting Republicans to adopt the same strategy.
[2:42:54.520 --> 2:42:58.520]  Well, we are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage.
[2:42:58.520 --> 2:43:01.520]  And that's why we need you to go to the site now.

[2:47:23.520 --> 2:47:26.520]  All right, Mike, Mark Rundaz is a great First Amendment lawyer.
[2:47:26.520 --> 2:47:29.520]  He's my lawyer amongst the other great team I've got.
[2:47:29.520 --> 2:47:33.520]  He was making some great points about how he's been attacked and persecuted even personally.
[2:47:33.520 --> 2:47:36.520]  He didn't want to get into the stories for representing me.
[2:47:36.520 --> 2:47:44.520]  Well, whatever happened to the Sixth Amendment or the First Amendment, I mean everybody always knew like Charlie Manson gets a lawyer or Charlie Manson can publish a book.
[2:47:44.520 --> 2:47:48.520]  CNN says no Jones can't publish a book saying what he actually believes.
[2:47:48.520 --> 2:47:52.520]  We're going to tell you what he believes and not let him have a voice.
[2:47:52.520 --> 2:47:54.520]  That is so fundamental, Mark.
[2:47:54.520 --> 2:48:00.520]  Look, when I am, you know, I told a journalist who interviewed me and said, you know, they said, where's your line?
[2:48:00.520 --> 2:48:03.520]  Because you're not the only controversial client I have.
[2:48:03.520 --> 2:48:07.520]  In fact, you don't need a First Amendment lawyer if you're not that controversial.
[2:48:07.520 --> 2:48:10.520]  And, you know, some of the people I represent are pretty far on the left.
[2:48:10.520 --> 2:48:12.520]  Some are pretty far on the right.
[2:48:12.520 --> 2:48:22.520]  And I explained to this journalist, he said, if you have a problem with defending somebody because you have a problem with their speech, then you're not a First Amendment lawyer.
[2:48:22.520 --> 2:48:23.520]  You're just doing it wrong.
[2:48:23.520 --> 2:48:25.520]  You know, then you're just joining a team.
[2:48:25.520 --> 2:48:26.520]  You're on a side.
[2:48:26.520 --> 2:48:29.520]  Well, what about being a fan of due process?
[2:48:29.520 --> 2:48:31.520]  Yeah, look, I mean, a right to defense.
[2:48:31.520 --> 2:48:36.520]  We're talking Soviet Union or Nazi Germany that people don't have right to a defense.
[2:48:36.520 --> 2:48:41.520]  I have people who have come after me for defending you, for defending other controversial figures.
[2:48:41.520 --> 2:48:42.520]  And to me, I revel.
[2:48:42.520 --> 2:48:44.520]  I mean, I love the criticism.
[2:48:44.520 --> 2:48:45.520]  Bring it on.
[2:48:45.520 --> 2:48:48.520]  You know, I don't feel persecuted by it.
[2:48:48.520 --> 2:48:55.520]  I laugh and mock it because I know when I'm pissing people off, I'm doing something right.
[2:48:55.520 --> 2:49:00.520]  Because we do not need the First Amendment for, you know, children's books.
[2:49:00.520 --> 2:49:03.520]  We don't need the First Amendment for, you know, Mr. Rogers.
[2:49:03.520 --> 2:49:05.520]  But when you look at...
[2:49:05.520 --> 2:49:08.520]  We need to stop cults of mental control.
[2:49:08.520 --> 2:49:10.520]  Cults that want to run thought.
[2:49:10.520 --> 2:49:12.520]  When you have controversial speech.
[2:49:12.520 --> 2:49:19.520]  And I look at every one of these cases that I do as a speed bump on the way to speech that I want,
[2:49:19.520 --> 2:49:22.520]  that really that speech that's near and dear to us.
[2:49:22.520 --> 2:49:24.520]  And I want that speed bump high.
[2:49:24.520 --> 2:49:27.520]  I want that speed bump to wreck anything that drives over it.
[2:49:27.520 --> 2:49:28.520]  That's what I want.
[2:49:28.520 --> 2:49:34.520]  And, you know, these people who at one point were completely free speech, you know,
[2:49:34.520 --> 2:49:41.520]  I remember when communists were the ones getting attacked by, you know, trying to get shut down.
[2:49:41.520 --> 2:49:42.520]  There was a time...
[2:49:42.520 --> 2:49:44.520]  And now they're the ones that want to shut down free speech because they're empowered.
[2:49:44.520 --> 2:49:45.520]  It's insane. You look at these...
[2:49:45.520 --> 2:49:47.520]  So they didn't believe in the American experiment.
[2:49:47.520 --> 2:49:48.520]  We'll take this.
[2:49:48.520 --> 2:49:50.520]  Some of the other lawyers, some of the Texas cases go,
[2:49:50.520 --> 2:49:54.520]  listen, if the judges operate according to the Constitution, you're 100% win.
[2:49:54.520 --> 2:49:56.520]  They go, we researched everything they said.
[2:49:56.520 --> 2:49:58.520]  None of it's true.
[2:49:58.520 --> 2:50:00.520]  They said it's all edited.
[2:50:00.520 --> 2:50:01.520]  It's all BS.
[2:50:01.520 --> 2:50:03.520]  They said we've never seen something like this.
[2:50:03.520 --> 2:50:06.520]  And that's what I'm saying is, I've never seen such an organized...
[2:50:06.520 --> 2:50:11.520]  I mean, why do you think there's 10,000 articles the last week saying that I beat up a kid
[2:50:11.520 --> 2:50:12.520]  and then don't say where I beat a kid up?
[2:50:12.520 --> 2:50:14.520]  I mean, how do you publish an article saying,
[2:50:14.520 --> 2:50:18.520]  Jones is off YouTube, he beat up a kid and they don't say where or when?
[2:50:18.520 --> 2:50:19.520]  Yeah, well, that's, you know, it's...
[2:50:19.520 --> 2:50:20.520]  Look, it's...
[2:50:20.520 --> 2:50:23.520]  There's a decline in the quality of journalism, obviously.
[2:50:23.520 --> 2:50:28.520]  I mean, when, you know, when I was in J-School, everybody, for the most part,
[2:50:28.520 --> 2:50:29.520]  wanted to be the next Woodward and Burns.
[2:50:29.520 --> 2:50:31.520]  Because you have a degree in journalism as well, not just law.
[2:50:31.520 --> 2:50:33.520]  Two of them, actually, yeah.
[2:50:33.520 --> 2:50:34.520]  But, you know, I was...
[2:50:34.520 --> 2:50:36.520]  We all were kind of pushed towards print.
[2:50:36.520 --> 2:50:38.520]  We were pushed towards classic journalism.
[2:50:38.520 --> 2:50:43.520]  And then by the time I got to grad school and I saw that most people were going for PR
[2:50:43.520 --> 2:50:47.520]  and it was just sort of the old romantics that were still going into print journalism.
[2:50:47.520 --> 2:50:49.520]  They were PR people posing as journalists.
[2:50:49.520 --> 2:50:51.520]  Oh, no, there were people who were genuinely saying,
[2:50:51.520 --> 2:50:55.520]  I want to go to J-School so that I can learn how to be a PR professional.
[2:50:55.520 --> 2:50:58.520]  So that was, you know, that was more what they were geared toward.
[2:50:58.520 --> 2:51:02.520]  And I think that you just have a decline in quality, in part because of the market.
[2:51:02.520 --> 2:51:04.520]  Look, everybody wants to be the first one out.
[2:51:04.520 --> 2:51:06.520]  Everyone wants to get the most clicks.
[2:51:06.520 --> 2:51:10.520]  And you got to do that by being sensational and fast and, you know...
[2:51:10.520 --> 2:51:12.520]  But see, I never...
[2:51:12.520 --> 2:51:14.520]  I never did stuff on purpose where I've been wrong.
[2:51:14.520 --> 2:51:16.520]  I've been wrong some.
[2:51:16.520 --> 2:51:19.520]  I found covering things nobody else covered was what was sensational.
[2:51:19.520 --> 2:51:23.520]  And it was near and dear to my heart, like the relaunch of America, exposing globalism.
[2:51:23.520 --> 2:51:27.520]  I knew they were having CFR and trilateral and Bilderberg group meetings.
[2:51:27.520 --> 2:51:29.520]  They wrote books admitting it.
[2:51:29.520 --> 2:51:31.520]  And I was going, hey, look, Rockefeller says in his book,
[2:51:31.520 --> 2:51:33.520]  he wants the world government to end the family.
[2:51:33.520 --> 2:51:35.520]  And they would go, oh, you're crazy. It doesn't exist.
[2:51:35.520 --> 2:51:37.520]  I bought the book at Barnes & Nobles.
[2:51:37.520 --> 2:51:39.520]  So I've really been doing real journalism.
[2:51:39.520 --> 2:51:44.520]  Look, whatever the narrative, you know, whatever the narrative you're questioning is,
[2:51:44.520 --> 2:51:46.520]  I want people doing that in America.
[2:51:46.520 --> 2:51:51.520]  I don't care if, you know, I mean, you think like the people who say the moon landing was faked.
[2:51:51.520 --> 2:51:53.520]  I think that's crazy.
[2:51:53.520 --> 2:51:55.520]  By the way, they say I said that and I didn't say that.
[2:51:55.520 --> 2:51:57.520]  You know, it doesn't matter.
[2:51:57.520 --> 2:52:01.520]  I want people to ask that question because I want the official narrative.
[2:52:01.520 --> 2:52:05.520]  By the way, parts of it were faked because they didn't want to show some of the advanced technology
[2:52:05.520 --> 2:52:07.520]  given the military 30 years ahead.
[2:52:07.520 --> 2:52:09.520]  So they had support ships, whole deal.
[2:52:09.520 --> 2:52:11.520]  And I talked to people that were at NASA.
[2:52:11.520 --> 2:52:13.520]  So there was more there.
[2:52:13.520 --> 2:52:16.520]  And then they had that on radiation belt problems getting filmed back.
[2:52:16.520 --> 2:52:18.520]  So they doctored some photos, but we've been at the moon, believe me.
[2:52:18.520 --> 2:52:21.520]  Look, I've got nuclear weapons attack bases on it right now.
[2:52:21.520 --> 2:52:23.520]  I mean, maybe we do.
[2:52:23.520 --> 2:52:29.520]  But what I really want is I want people like you out there questioning the official narrative,
[2:52:29.520 --> 2:52:31.520]  because I do not trust my government.
[2:52:31.520 --> 2:52:33.520]  I just laid massive secret intel on you.
[2:52:33.520 --> 2:52:38.520]  Look, it's not just, you know, Kennedy said, you know, ask not what you can do for your,
[2:52:38.520 --> 2:52:41.520]  you know, what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.
[2:52:41.520 --> 2:52:46.520]  I say, you know, what the Avengers said, which is, you know, ask what your country's been doing to you.
[2:52:46.520 --> 2:52:48.520]  I want people questioning that official narrative.
[2:52:48.520 --> 2:52:49.520]  No, I agree.
[2:52:49.520 --> 2:52:50.520]  So let me ask you this.
[2:52:50.520 --> 2:52:51.520]  Exactly.
[2:52:51.520 --> 2:52:52.520]  They say don't question an official narrative.
[2:52:52.520 --> 2:52:57.520]  If we've been lied to about Gulf of Tonkin and babies and incubators and WMDs and everything else,
[2:52:57.520 --> 2:52:58.520]  why wouldn't we question?
[2:52:58.520 --> 2:52:59.520]  Well, that's what we should.
[2:52:59.520 --> 2:53:05.520]  And look, if the questions, if you ask the question and ultimately it comes out, boy, that was a dumb question.
[2:53:05.520 --> 2:53:12.520]  You know, the moon landing really happened or, you know, there's some people trying to put, you know, radio signals into your head
[2:53:12.520 --> 2:53:14.520]  and you got to wear tin foil on your head.
[2:53:14.520 --> 2:53:21.520]  You know, these crazy ideas, those are valuable, even if for no other reason than to make sure that the official narrative
[2:53:21.520 --> 2:53:23.520]  has some questioning of it.
[2:53:23.520 --> 2:53:24.520]  That's what this...
[2:53:24.520 --> 2:53:25.520]  It's normal.
[2:53:25.520 --> 2:53:26.520]  It's normal.
[2:53:26.520 --> 2:53:32.520]  Even if that was a schizophrenic and, you know, wanted to say that, you know, the Sandy Hook parents were 14 foot tall giraffes from Pluto
[2:53:32.520 --> 2:53:34.520]  that, you know, that worship Easter bunnies.
[2:53:34.520 --> 2:53:35.520]  I'm not saying that.
[2:53:35.520 --> 2:53:36.520]  I'm assuming for that.
[2:53:36.520 --> 2:53:39.520]  But, but, I mean, that's my right to say it exactly.
[2:53:39.520 --> 2:53:40.520]  It's not just your right.
[2:53:40.520 --> 2:53:42.520]  It's your responsibility to say they're giant giraffes.
[2:53:42.520 --> 2:53:46.520]  It's your responsibility to question the official net.
[2:53:46.520 --> 2:53:47.520]  Let me ask you this.
[2:53:47.520 --> 2:53:50.520]  You're a smart guy, extrapolating just in a thin slicing gestalt.
[2:53:50.520 --> 2:53:57.520]  Where do you think this ends with this war on free speech in Europe and here and Hollywood's craziness in their attempts at all this stuff?
[2:53:57.520 --> 2:53:58.520]  I mean, where does it go?
[2:53:58.520 --> 2:54:01.520]  Because the bullying isn't intimidating everybody.
[2:54:01.520 --> 2:54:02.520]  I know it.
[2:54:02.520 --> 2:54:03.520]  It's actually making them get politically involved.
[2:54:03.520 --> 2:54:04.520]  Right.
[2:54:04.520 --> 2:54:06.520]  Well, hopefully that's what happens.
[2:54:06.520 --> 2:54:08.520]  You know, I mean, I'm not, you know, I might be a smart guy.
[2:54:08.520 --> 2:54:14.520]  I'm not smart enough to say where it does end, but I do see multiple, you know, possible outcomes.
[2:54:14.520 --> 2:54:22.520]  One outcome could be that people start to realize that attacks on free speech aren't going to benefit anybody.
[2:54:22.520 --> 2:54:29.520]  Even if you like the silent, you know, even if you want to squelch a certain voice, that's not good for you as an American.
[2:54:29.520 --> 2:54:38.520]  If that voice gets squelched, you know, I mean, the best, you know, I remember seeing years ago before we, you know, not that many years ago,
[2:54:38.520 --> 2:54:42.520]  but before it was okay to go ahead and engage in political violence.
[2:54:42.520 --> 2:54:55.520]  I saw a video of a Nazi rally and it was the greatest protest against a Nazi rally I'd ever seen because this kid was walking behind these guys playing dress up Nazis playing the tuba.
[2:54:55.520 --> 2:55:03.520]  And it was just this boom, boom, boom sound behind them and it made them from, you know, from dress up Nazis into comical clowns.
[2:55:03.520 --> 2:55:09.520]  And what a great way to discredit them with additional speech, just that little, that little tuba.
[2:55:09.520 --> 2:55:10.520]  Exactly.
[2:55:10.520 --> 2:55:11.520]  You don't cut down their speech.
[2:55:11.520 --> 2:55:20.520]  But then, you know, but then six months later, I saw a similar march, similar idiots out there, and then they just got attacked, you know, and they were getting hit with brick.
[2:55:20.520 --> 2:55:22.520]  And that made them the victim, like Gandhi.
[2:55:22.520 --> 2:55:27.520]  And then I'm sitting there and I'm looking and I'm saying, my God, I'm so mad at these people attacking them.
[2:55:27.520 --> 2:55:36.520]  And funny enough, in that video, I remember the one guy, one guy saved another guy's life and it was actually a Jewish guy dove on top of one of these guys and said, stop hitting it.
[2:55:36.520 --> 2:55:47.520]  You know, and it was when I saw that and I said, now here I am sympathizing with these Nazis simply because they are having the crap beaten out of them.
[2:55:47.520 --> 2:55:50.520]  And all you got to do is stand there and point and laugh.
[2:55:50.520 --> 2:55:53.520]  You know, if you don't like somebody's speech, if somebody's speech is.
[2:55:53.520 --> 2:55:54.520]  Listen, I know you're trying.
[2:55:54.520 --> 2:55:55.520]  Here's the deal.
[2:55:55.520 --> 2:55:56.520]  I know you're Mark, Mark, Mark, Mark.
[2:55:56.520 --> 2:56:01.520]  You keep trying to sell people on America and free speech and that's great to a jury.
[2:56:01.520 --> 2:56:10.520]  The big corporate media, they put out a press release put out by Soros or the Democratic Party and then a thousand publications a day parrot it.
[2:56:10.520 --> 2:56:12.520]  Yeah, well, these are mercenaries.
[2:56:12.520 --> 2:56:15.520]  They don't even have any compunction about being a journalist.
[2:56:15.520 --> 2:56:19.520]  They know they're not there in an organized corporate conspiracy.
[2:56:19.520 --> 2:56:22.520]  His mainstream media is dying to demonize their opposition.
[2:56:22.520 --> 2:56:23.520]  Shut it down.
[2:56:23.520 --> 2:56:25.520]  And I'm not as important as they say.
[2:56:25.520 --> 2:56:26.520]  Yeah, we got a big show.
[2:56:26.520 --> 2:56:28.520]  We didn't reach 86 million people the week of the election.
[2:56:28.520 --> 2:56:29.520]  That really made them get scared.
[2:56:29.520 --> 2:56:33.520]  We still reach 15, 20 million people a week, even with all the suppression.
[2:56:33.520 --> 2:56:37.520]  They're trying to end the First Amendment.
[2:56:37.520 --> 2:56:38.520]  It's in the cases.
[2:56:38.520 --> 2:56:39.520]  It's a program.
[2:56:39.520 --> 2:56:44.520]  And if Congress and the president and the people don't meet it as such and say, no, you're not going to do that.
[2:56:44.520 --> 2:56:46.520]  We know what you're doing instead of arguing.
[2:56:46.520 --> 2:56:48.520]  I saw it during the break.
[2:56:48.520 --> 2:56:54.520]  Facebook's getting ready to lure all out news systems along with Twitter to battle Russian bots in 2018.
[2:56:54.520 --> 2:56:58.520]  80% of the Russian bots were a very small amount of the bots were pro-Hillary.
[2:56:58.520 --> 2:57:01.520]  You can go to foreign countries and hire PR firms.
[2:57:01.520 --> 2:57:08.520]  So now censoring me, censoring, they're banning Republican congressmen from advertising on Facebook saying you're a Russian.
[2:57:08.520 --> 2:57:10.520]  It's a witch hunt, man.
[2:57:10.520 --> 2:57:18.520]  Look, if I can sell just to your listeners and your viewers to get involved, to start, you know.
[2:57:18.520 --> 2:57:22.520]  Look, these companies react to capitalist forces.
[2:57:22.520 --> 2:57:24.520]  Well, send them letters.
[2:57:24.520 --> 2:57:28.520]  You want to cancel your... Everyone go to Spotify and click on the Alex Jones podcast.
[2:57:28.520 --> 2:57:29.520]  Yeah.
[2:57:29.520 --> 2:57:30.520]  And let them know you want it.
[2:57:30.520 --> 2:57:31.520]  And everybody go to infowarstore.com.
[2:57:31.520 --> 2:57:34.520]  And send emails to Spotify saying...
[2:57:34.520 --> 2:57:38.520]  Yeah, it's a war and we need you in it right now or we could lose it.
[2:57:38.520 --> 2:57:40.520]  Mark Rondaz is our guest.
[2:57:40.520 --> 2:57:41.520]  We'll be right back.
[2:57:41.520 --> 2:58:05.520]  Paul Joseph Watson takes over from London.

[2:58:36.520 --> 2:58:39.520]  We sold it at 50% off till it's sold out.
[2:58:39.520 --> 2:58:42.520]  And I think it's going to be the same way with this fiber.

[3:00:12.520 --> 3:00:19.520]  You know, folks, our military is not perfect and Trump's not perfect and I'm not perfect.
[3:00:19.520 --> 3:00:22.520]  But you know, China is run by communist dictatorship.
[3:00:22.520 --> 3:00:25.520]  They don't have real elections and they're trying to suppress the country.
[3:00:25.520 --> 3:00:26.520]  They own Hollywood.
[3:00:26.520 --> 3:00:30.520]  They're actually trying to get Apple, Facebook, Twitter to censor to be able to come into China.
[3:00:30.520 --> 3:00:35.520]  And so these big tech companies are kind of like hookers out on the street showing their leg to China saying,
[3:00:35.520 --> 3:00:45.520]  look, we censored these Americans let us in. It's really pathetic. And so I want to tell the leftist 10 years ago, I thought about retiring.
[3:00:45.520 --> 3:00:49.520]  Because I got a family ranch and all this other stuff and I knew this was going to get more serious.
[3:00:49.520 --> 3:00:51.520]  But you tried to shut me down so I kept going.
[3:00:51.520 --> 3:00:57.520]  So all your attacks guarantee that I'm going to work 18 hours a day instead of 14 hours a day.
[3:00:57.520 --> 3:01:01.520]  And I'm never going to quit and surrender because I know you're not just trying to abuse me.
[3:01:01.520 --> 3:01:05.520]  You're trying to abuse everybody and we're going to stand against you.
[3:01:05.520 --> 3:01:09.520]  But I mean, look, you can see America coming back, Mark, and you've had the courage to point that out.
[3:01:09.520 --> 3:01:12.520]  You didn't vote for Trump, but you may vote for him now seeing what's happening.
[3:01:12.520 --> 3:01:20.520]  And just the level of hate by the special interest in closing, where do you see this going and how do we fight back against this?
[3:01:20.520 --> 3:01:26.520]  Look, where I see it going, I'm going to be optimistic about it.
[3:01:26.520 --> 3:01:33.520]  Where I see it going is people waking up to the fact that any challenge to free speech is an attack on all of us.
[3:01:33.520 --> 3:01:40.520]  Even if it's somebody attacking the free speech of somebody that you hate, that's what the First Amendment is there for.
[3:01:40.520 --> 3:01:42.520]  It's freedom for the thought that you hate.
[3:01:42.520 --> 3:01:46.520]  So if you see thoughts that you like getting attacked, you've got to get involved.
[3:01:46.520 --> 3:01:49.520]  You can't just sit there and say, isn't this terrible?
[3:01:49.520 --> 3:01:53.520]  You can't just sit there and put, you know, comments, crazy comments underneath the news.
[3:01:53.520 --> 3:01:58.520]  Well, actually, most people kind of go, oh yeah, Alex Jones is kind of bad, but don't ban him.
[3:01:58.520 --> 3:02:02.520]  Kind of like Ted Cruz did, or Tucker Carlson defended me full-throated.
[3:02:02.520 --> 3:02:05.520]  I mean, you have to understand, this is all a misrepresentation, a beta test for everybody.
[3:02:05.520 --> 3:02:07.520]  Well, that's how I see it.
[3:02:07.520 --> 3:02:09.520]  You know, first they started banning people.
[3:02:09.520 --> 3:02:11.520]  You know, first it was ban Nazis.
[3:02:11.520 --> 3:02:15.520]  Then it was ban, you know, ban people a little to the left of Nazis.
[3:02:15.520 --> 3:02:17.520]  Then it was just start banning conservatives.
[3:02:17.520 --> 3:02:20.520]  And that is, you know, that's really terrifying.
[3:02:20.520 --> 3:02:25.520]  And if these companies can do this unchecked, you know, you've got to get involved in this.
[3:02:25.520 --> 3:02:26.520]  You've got to write to your...
[3:02:26.520 --> 3:02:29.520]  Shouldn't they be concerned that Trump's pointing out it's illegal?
[3:02:29.520 --> 3:02:30.520]  It's racketeering.
[3:02:30.520 --> 3:02:33.520]  It's campaign contributions that Democrats can block.
[3:02:33.520 --> 3:02:39.520]  They're blocking Republican congressmen and women from even showing campaign ads.
[3:02:39.520 --> 3:02:40.520]  But they let the...
[3:02:40.520 --> 3:02:45.520]  I mean, they just hired this former Obama official to run censorship in Facebook.
[3:02:45.520 --> 3:02:46.520]  And I mean, that's crazy.
[3:02:46.520 --> 3:02:49.520]  It wouldn't matter so much if these companies weren't so monopolistic.
[3:02:49.520 --> 3:02:51.520]  You know what we really...
[3:02:51.520 --> 3:02:54.520]  Yeah, I don't care who runs them as long as they let me have my free speech.
[3:02:54.520 --> 3:02:59.520]  Look, if anybody from the DOJ's antitrust division is listening, you know,
[3:02:59.520 --> 3:03:01.520]  can you show up at work one of these days, please?
[3:03:01.520 --> 3:03:04.520]  Because, you know, you do have a job to do.
[3:03:04.520 --> 3:03:07.520]  Explain as a lawyer what you see them doing.
[3:03:07.520 --> 3:03:08.520]  That's a trust.
[3:03:08.520 --> 3:03:16.520]  Look, when you have such market share and then you use that in a way to exclude other people from entering that market,
[3:03:16.520 --> 3:03:17.520]  that's an antitrust problem.
[3:03:17.520 --> 3:03:18.520]  That's 101.
[3:03:18.520 --> 3:03:19.520]  Right. I mean, it's easy.
[3:03:19.520 --> 3:03:20.520]  I don't even...
[3:03:20.520 --> 3:03:23.520]  That's like the Nazis putting people in ghettos.
[3:03:23.520 --> 3:03:24.520]  I mean, that's a little...
[3:03:24.520 --> 3:03:26.520]  That's what drugs called it, electronic ghettos.
[3:03:26.520 --> 3:03:29.520]  Yeah, I mean, I'm not really going to break Godwin's law here,
[3:03:29.520 --> 3:03:33.520]  but I'll just say that it is a monopolistic problem.
[3:03:33.520 --> 3:03:35.520]  It's the beginning of putting people in ghettos.
[3:03:35.520 --> 3:03:36.520]  It is...
[3:03:36.520 --> 3:03:39.520]  When you restrict people from the marketplace of ideas and monopolies...
[3:03:39.520 --> 3:03:43.520]  Well, then what it is, is it's more of a stranglehold on information.
[3:03:43.520 --> 3:03:47.520]  You know, that is the hallmark of any dictatorship.
[3:03:47.520 --> 3:03:50.520]  Now, we're just more elegant in the United States.
[3:03:50.520 --> 3:03:52.520]  You know, I tell people when I lecture in Europe, I say,
[3:03:52.520 --> 3:03:54.520]  look, we don't really have corruption.
[3:03:54.520 --> 3:03:57.520]  We call it campaign contributions.
[3:03:57.520 --> 3:03:59.520]  So it's, you know, we don't stick the envelope.
[3:03:59.520 --> 3:04:04.520]  You know, we don't do the little bustarella where we hand the envelope underneath the table like they do in Italy.
[3:04:04.520 --> 3:04:08.520]  We give a check and we take a picture of ourselves next to the candidate with a big smile.
[3:04:08.520 --> 3:04:09.520]  We do it out in the open.
[3:04:09.520 --> 3:04:10.520]  Sorry?
[3:04:10.520 --> 3:04:11.520]  I mean, they do it out in the open.
[3:04:11.520 --> 3:04:15.520]  Sure, we do it out in the open because we've got an elegance here.
[3:04:15.520 --> 3:04:18.520]  So instead of our government going and saying,
[3:04:18.520 --> 3:04:20.520]  we're going to restrict everything somebody has to say,
[3:04:20.520 --> 3:04:21.520]  we now privatize it.
[3:04:21.520 --> 3:04:26.520]  We say, okay, you know what, Facebook, you can have 90%, 95% market share.
[3:04:26.520 --> 3:04:27.520]  We're not going to break you up.
[3:04:27.520 --> 3:04:30.520]  And then when Facebook starts to engage in censorship,
[3:04:30.520 --> 3:04:33.520]  I start to ask myself, why are we letting them get away with it?
[3:04:33.520 --> 3:04:40.520]  Yeah, you know, we've really got to look at what free speech means.
[3:04:40.520 --> 3:04:45.520]  And this will kill America and foreign powers are involved like China.
[3:04:45.520 --> 3:04:47.520]  It's a national security issue, clear and present danger.
[3:04:47.520 --> 3:04:50.520]  Rondazza Group, rondazza.com will talk to you very soon.
[3:04:50.520 --> 3:04:51.520]  An important meeting after this.
[3:04:51.520 --> 3:05:20.520]  Paul Watson's coming up. Stay with us.
[3:05:51.520 --> 3:06:02.520]  We are on the march. The empire is on the run.
[3:06:02.520 --> 3:06:24.520]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[3:06:24.520 --> 3:06:28.520]  You know, Paul Watson is a cool character.
[3:06:28.520 --> 3:06:32.520]  He's not trying to act cool. He's just a restrained guy, smart guy.
[3:06:32.520 --> 3:06:38.520]  And I'm flamboyant because the truth is pretty explosive.
[3:06:38.520 --> 3:06:40.520]  Let me tell you something.
[3:06:40.520 --> 3:06:43.520]  I'm not as important as they're saying on the news.
[3:06:43.520 --> 3:06:47.520]  Every local TV station across the country is running packages saying,
[3:06:47.520 --> 3:06:50.520]  Jones beat up a kid. He's being taken off the internet.
[3:06:50.520 --> 3:06:52.520]  They never say where I beat the kid up.
[3:06:52.520 --> 3:06:56.520]  That jump to say things like that that are totally untrue.
[3:06:56.520 --> 3:06:59.520]  It's beyond saying Saddam's got nuclear weapons and he did,
[3:06:59.520 --> 3:07:04.520]  or Colin Powell holding up the anthrax.
[3:07:04.520 --> 3:07:07.520]  So they're making their move.
[3:07:07.520 --> 3:07:13.520]  And all I can tell you is infowars.com and newswars.com and prisonplanet.com
[3:07:13.520 --> 3:07:16.520]  is just there promoting Americana and Renaissance and freedom.
[3:07:16.520 --> 3:07:19.520]  And when you go there, you'll see the Spanish police
[3:07:19.520 --> 3:07:24.520]  warn 50,000 invaders waiting in Morocco to take over.
[3:07:24.520 --> 3:07:28.520]  Soros is funding, of course, Cortez, the communist.
[3:07:28.520 --> 3:07:30.520]  I mean, it's all there.
[3:07:30.520 --> 3:07:32.520]  The free app, infowars.com,
[3:07:32.520 --> 3:07:34.520]  the official app that works so great,
[3:07:34.520 --> 3:07:36.520]  gives you push notifications when we're going live
[3:07:36.520 --> 3:07:39.520]  during special events and news feeds, infowars.com,
[3:07:39.520 --> 3:07:42.520]  I know you've been in the fight forever, kind of like I have been.
[3:07:42.520 --> 3:07:44.520]  So you kind of just get used to the attacks,
[3:07:44.520 --> 3:07:45.520]  used to censorship.
[3:07:45.520 --> 3:07:48.520]  If you get frosty and you really spread the word,
[3:07:48.520 --> 3:07:50.520]  people are ready to hear, hey,
[3:07:50.520 --> 3:07:53.520]  why don't you download the free infowars app?
[3:07:53.520 --> 3:07:55.520]  And you'll link to it, infowars.com,
[3:07:55.520 --> 3:07:59.520]  why don't you hear why I say 10,000?
[3:07:59.520 --> 3:08:02.520]  And that was like a week ago, it's got to be 20,000.
[3:08:02.520 --> 3:08:06.520]  Because they took one fake article that was put in the statesman
[3:08:06.520 --> 3:08:10.520]  and I know they republished it in over a thousand publications.
[3:08:10.520 --> 3:08:16.520]  Chicago Tribune, Honolulu Advertiser, Baltimore Sun.
[3:08:16.520 --> 3:08:19.520]  I can't even keep track anymore.
[3:08:19.520 --> 3:08:22.520]  And I'm not, see, I don't think of myself as myself
[3:08:22.520 --> 3:08:26.520]  as being the most selfish, greedy person you've ever met.
[3:08:26.520 --> 3:08:27.520]  Seriously.
[3:08:27.520 --> 3:08:30.520]  I think I'm connected to all of you and my children.
[3:08:30.520 --> 3:08:32.520]  And I'm connected to the human experience.
[3:08:32.520 --> 3:08:36.520]  So I see myself as all of you and you as me.
[3:08:36.520 --> 3:08:39.520]  But then I'm an individual trying to manifest that,
[3:08:39.520 --> 3:08:41.520]  the opposite of their fake collectivism.
[3:08:41.520 --> 3:08:44.520]  So I don't care about my personal life or my treasure.
[3:08:44.520 --> 3:08:47.520]  I actually care about the big win against these people.
[3:08:47.520 --> 3:08:50.520]  And they don't know how to deal with that, you see.
[3:08:50.520 --> 3:08:51.520]  So they're really upset.
[3:08:51.520 --> 3:08:54.520]  So I'm going to hand this over to Paul Watson right now.
[3:08:54.520 --> 3:08:55.520]  So much is going on.
[3:08:55.520 --> 3:08:57.520]  This is ahead of 2018.
[3:08:57.520 --> 3:08:59.520]  This is only two and a half months out.
[3:08:59.520 --> 3:09:01.520]  This is ahead of whatever they're going to pull.
[3:09:01.520 --> 3:09:02.520]  They want everybody silenced.
[3:09:02.520 --> 3:09:04.520]  They want the president to silence us.
[3:09:04.520 --> 3:09:06.520]  And they're making their move right now.
[3:09:06.520 --> 3:09:08.520]  Just briefly, if you want to support us
[3:09:08.520 --> 3:09:10.520]  and make sure we can defeat the globalist,
[3:09:10.520 --> 3:09:12.520]  infoworkstore.com.
[3:09:12.520 --> 3:09:13.520]  infoworkslife.com.
[3:09:13.520 --> 3:09:15.520]  Triple A, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[3:09:15.520 --> 3:09:17.520]  I mean, we've got the best vitamin D3.
[3:09:17.520 --> 3:09:20.520]  We've got the best vitamin B12.

[3:09:26.520 --> 3:09:29.520]  You know, there's a model where you do fancy advertising
[3:09:29.520 --> 3:09:31.520]  and you triple or quadruple charge somebody.

[3:10:18.520 --> 3:10:21.520]  I want to encourage those of you that haven't to get in the fight.
[3:10:21.520 --> 3:10:25.520]  But how this works is, Jones has been sued for saying,
[3:10:25.520 --> 3:10:28.520]  you know, nobody died here or there, made up lies.
[3:10:28.520 --> 3:10:29.520]  Out of context.
[3:10:29.520 --> 3:10:33.520]  Then, oh, Jones was taken off YouTube, which I wasn't.
[3:10:33.520 --> 3:10:34.520]  They put a fake strike on.
[3:10:34.520 --> 3:10:36.520]  They removed the last fake strikes months ago
[3:10:36.520 --> 3:10:42.520]  because he said that, you know, he beat up a kid.
[3:10:42.520 --> 3:10:48.520]  Again, the level of the unified, organized discipline
[3:10:48.520 --> 3:10:51.520]  of corporate media to all lie together
[3:10:51.520 --> 3:10:55.520]  and all sing from one page of music shows you
[3:10:55.520 --> 3:10:59.520]  that the universities have bred an entire class of people
[3:10:59.520 --> 3:11:01.520]  that are free speech and America killers.
[3:11:01.520 --> 3:11:05.520]  So Paul, you've got a big 45 minutes coming up here,
[3:11:05.520 --> 3:11:06.520]  or 50 minutes.
[3:11:06.520 --> 3:11:08.520]  So go ahead and take over, my friend.
[3:11:08.520 --> 3:11:10.520]  God bless you.
[3:11:10.520 --> 3:11:12.520]  Okay, thanks, Alex. Yeah, we're talking about fake news.
[3:11:12.520 --> 3:11:14.520]  Let's get into this from the off.
[3:11:14.520 --> 3:11:20.520]  CNN routinely puts out the most harmful fake news imaginable,
[3:11:20.520 --> 3:11:23.520]  which actually leads to persecution, oppression, torture,
[3:11:23.520 --> 3:11:25.520]  imprisonment and loss of lives.
[3:11:25.520 --> 3:11:27.520]  This is what we need to talk about right now.
[3:11:27.520 --> 3:11:30.520]  Two different examples of that today.
[3:11:30.520 --> 3:11:32.520]  We'll start off with the revelation about the
[3:11:32.520 --> 3:11:34.520]  Manchester bomber Salman Abadi.
[3:11:34.520 --> 3:11:38.520]  Now, of course, he killed 22 people in the Manchester Arena bombing
[3:11:38.520 --> 3:11:41.520]  last year, half of whom were children.
[3:11:41.520 --> 3:11:45.520]  Now it emerges that the British Royal Navy
[3:11:45.520 --> 3:11:49.520]  rescued him from Libya in August 2014 after NATO
[3:11:49.520 --> 3:11:54.520]  had destabilized that country, brought him back to the UK
[3:11:54.520 --> 3:11:57.520]  just three years later, less than three years later,
[3:11:57.520 --> 3:11:59.520]  he committed that carnage.
[3:11:59.520 --> 3:12:01.520]  How does this relate to CNN?
[3:12:01.520 --> 3:12:03.520]  Well, it goes back to the fact that they pushed
[3:12:03.520 --> 3:12:07.520]  the most harmful, bloody, blood-curdling end of life
[3:12:07.520 --> 3:12:10.520]  making fake news every single time.
[3:12:10.520 --> 3:12:14.520]  This happened that you can draw a direct line
[3:12:14.520 --> 3:12:17.520]  between him being rescued by the Royal Navy,
[3:12:17.520 --> 3:12:19.520]  having had NATO destabilize the country.
[3:12:19.520 --> 3:12:23.520]  Remember, Obama Cameron and Hillary Clinton went in
[3:12:23.520 --> 3:12:26.520]  to support Al Qaeda, the LIFG,
[3:12:26.520 --> 3:12:29.520]  knowing that they were jihadists because they wanted to topple
[3:12:29.520 --> 3:12:32.520]  Gaddafi because he'd stopped playing ball.
[3:12:32.520 --> 3:12:36.520]  So that destabilization campaign led to the fall of Libya,
[3:12:36.520 --> 3:12:39.520]  led to the migrant crisis, led to the terror attacks in Europe,
[3:12:39.520 --> 3:12:42.520]  led to the explosion in violent crime
[3:12:42.520 --> 3:12:44.520]  and sexual assaults in Europe,
[3:12:44.520 --> 3:12:46.520]  and who, right at the very beginning,
[3:12:46.520 --> 3:12:49.520]  was poshing the propaganda to justify,
[3:12:49.520 --> 3:12:55.520]  to legitimize that NATO destabilization of Libya in 2011.
[3:12:55.520 --> 3:12:57.520]  It was CNN.
[3:12:57.520 --> 3:12:59.520]  This is a specific example.
[3:12:59.520 --> 3:13:02.520]  I'm not just talking about general propaganda,
[3:13:02.520 --> 3:13:06.520]  about how it was a humanitarian intervention,
[3:13:06.520 --> 3:13:08.520]  which was the narrative we heard over and over at the time
[3:13:08.520 --> 3:13:11.520]  from the entirety of the mainstream media.
[3:13:11.520 --> 3:13:13.520]  I'm talking about a specific example.
[3:13:13.520 --> 3:13:16.520]  CNN headline from 2011.
[3:13:16.520 --> 3:13:18.520]  This is March 21, 2011.
[3:13:18.520 --> 3:13:22.520]  Why Libya 2011 is not Iraq 2003,
[3:13:22.520 --> 3:13:25.520]  written by not just some commentator
[3:13:25.520 --> 3:13:27.520]  that CNN has given a platform,
[3:13:27.520 --> 3:13:32.520]  but by Peter Bergen, CNN's chief national security analyst.
[3:13:32.520 --> 3:13:35.520]  This is the top guy at CNN.
[3:13:35.520 --> 3:13:37.520]  And he said basically, he made the argument,
[3:13:37.520 --> 3:13:39.520]  I'm not going to read the whole article,
[3:13:39.520 --> 3:13:40.520]  you can read it for yourself.
[3:13:40.520 --> 3:13:44.520]  His argument was that this was not like Iraq in 2003,
[3:13:44.520 --> 3:13:47.520]  that it wouldn't lead to a wider destabilization,
[3:13:47.520 --> 3:13:49.520]  that it wouldn't cause nearly as many problems.
[3:13:49.520 --> 3:13:53.520]  And you could argue that it caused even more problems
[3:13:53.520 --> 3:13:56.520]  than the attack, the invasion of Iraq in 2003
[3:13:56.520 --> 3:13:59.520]  because while obviously that costs more lives,
[3:13:59.520 --> 3:14:03.520]  in the long run, Libya really created the migrant crisis,
[3:14:03.520 --> 3:14:07.520]  which could end up costing more lives in terms of both attacks,
[3:14:07.520 --> 3:14:09.520]  in terms of both migrants drowning in the sea
[3:14:09.520 --> 3:14:12.520]  than people who died during the invasion of Iraq.
[3:14:12.520 --> 3:14:14.520]  Not only can you make that argument,
[3:14:14.520 --> 3:14:16.520]  you can make the argument that it led directly
[3:14:16.520 --> 3:14:19.520]  to the rise of ISIS, which it did in many cases.
[3:14:19.520 --> 3:14:24.520]  So this is CNN's top national security analyst in 2011
[3:14:24.520 --> 3:14:27.520]  before the invasion of Libya.
[3:14:27.520 --> 3:14:31.520]  Soft peddling it, justifying it, legitimizing it
[3:14:31.520 --> 3:14:35.520]  by lying and saying that it wouldn't be like Iraq in 2003
[3:14:35.520 --> 3:14:38.520]  when info was at the time was warning everyone
[3:14:38.520 --> 3:14:41.520]  that that's exactly what it would be like.
[3:14:41.520 --> 3:14:44.520]  Don't forget, we also opposed the intervention of Syria
[3:14:44.520 --> 3:14:47.520]  because we said we were supporting al-Qaeda jihadist,
[3:14:47.520 --> 3:14:51.520]  something that was born out to be completely correct too.
[3:14:51.520 --> 3:14:54.520]  The guy who the Royal Navy rescued from Libya
[3:14:54.520 --> 3:14:57.520]  as a result of the NATO intervention,
[3:14:57.520 --> 3:15:00.520]  which came about as a result of CNN legitimizing
[3:15:00.520 --> 3:15:02.520]  and dorsing this invasion,
[3:15:02.520 --> 3:15:05.520]  he went on to attack the Manchester arena,
[3:15:05.520 --> 3:15:10.520]  killing children, ripping them limb from limb, 22 dead,
[3:15:10.520 --> 3:15:15.520]  what was it, over 130 wounded, life-changing injuries,
[3:15:15.520 --> 3:15:17.520]  traumatized for life.
[3:15:17.520 --> 3:15:21.520]  And again, you can draw it all back to the NATO-sponsored,
[3:15:21.520 --> 3:15:25.520]  CNN-endorsed destabilization of Libya.
[3:15:25.520 --> 3:15:29.520]  We supported al-Qaeda when they were literally putting
[3:15:29.520 --> 3:15:32.520]  black people in concentration camps in Libya.
[3:15:32.520 --> 3:15:34.520]  Gaddafi warned us about it.
[3:15:34.520 --> 3:15:36.520]  He said there would be 500,000 migrants heading to Europe.
[3:15:36.520 --> 3:15:38.520]  That's exactly what's happened.
[3:15:38.520 --> 3:15:40.520]  He was right. He was a brutal dictator, but he was right.
[3:15:40.520 --> 3:15:43.520]  We were right. CNN was wrong.
[3:15:43.520 --> 3:15:47.520]  Their harmful fake news led directly to that situation,
[3:15:47.520 --> 3:15:49.520]  and it needs to be called out right now.
[3:15:49.520 --> 3:15:52.520]  This is the Alex Jones Show, 4th hour, infowars.com.
[3:15:52.520 --> 3:15:53.520]  We'll be back.
[3:15:53.520 --> 3:15:54.520]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[3:15:54.520 --> 3:15:56.520]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago
[3:15:56.520 --> 3:15:58.520]  when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[3:15:58.520 --> 3:15:59.520]  I sued the IRS in one.
[3:15:59.520 --> 3:16:02.520]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[3:16:02.520 --> 3:16:04.520]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement,
[3:16:04.520 --> 3:16:06.520]  and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems
[3:16:06.520 --> 3:16:08.520]  they thought might never be solved.

[3:19:19.520 --> 3:19:23.520]  in which they want to strangle our first amendment rights.

[3:20:13.520 --> 3:20:17.520]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios,
[3:20:17.520 --> 3:20:20.520]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:20.520 --> 3:20:25.520]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:20:25.520 --> 3:20:28.520]  Your backages for our live of the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:28.520 --> 3:20:31.520]  I talk about the most harmful brand of fake news
[3:20:31.520 --> 3:20:33.520]  which routinely comes from CNN.
[3:20:33.520 --> 3:20:35.520]  I was just making the point before the break.
[3:20:35.520 --> 3:20:39.520]  The invasion of Libya, which led to the migrant crisis,
[3:20:39.520 --> 3:20:41.520]  which led to the mass sexual assaults,
[3:20:41.520 --> 3:20:44.520]  the explosion in violent crime,
[3:20:44.520 --> 3:20:49.520]  which led to the Manchester bombing that killed 22 people, half of them children.
[3:20:49.520 --> 3:20:51.520]  Who was pushing for that invasion?
[3:20:51.520 --> 3:20:53.520]  Who was endorsing that invasion?
[3:20:53.520 --> 3:20:55.520]  Who was legitimizing that invasion?
[3:20:55.520 --> 3:20:57.520]  Who was saying, oh, don't worry.
[3:20:57.520 --> 3:20:59.520]  It's not going to be anything like Iraq.
[3:20:59.520 --> 3:21:02.520]  Turns out it was completely the same as Iraq.
[3:21:02.520 --> 3:21:04.520]  It destabilized the entire region,
[3:21:04.520 --> 3:21:07.520]  led to hundreds of thousands if not millions of displaced people.
[3:21:07.520 --> 3:21:13.520]  And once again, we were supporting basically the extremist side in the conflict.
[3:21:13.520 --> 3:21:15.520]  Yes, that same was a dictator.
[3:21:15.520 --> 3:21:17.520]  Yes, Colonel Gaddafi was a dictator.
[3:21:17.520 --> 3:21:20.520]  In the case of Libya, directly supporting groups
[3:21:20.520 --> 3:21:22.520]  which were directly affiliated,
[3:21:22.520 --> 3:21:24.520]  I'm talking about the Libyan Islamic fighting group,
[3:21:24.520 --> 3:21:27.520]  with Al Qaeda, with Islamic jihadists.
[3:21:27.520 --> 3:21:29.520]  Who was soft-soaping it?
[3:21:29.520 --> 3:21:31.520]  Who was justifying it?
[3:21:31.520 --> 3:21:33.520]  It was CNN.
[3:21:33.520 --> 3:21:36.520]  It was their chief national security analyst, Peter Bergen.
[3:21:36.520 --> 3:21:40.520]  Back in March 2011, saying, don't worry, everyone.
[3:21:40.520 --> 3:21:42.520]  It's going to be nothing like Iraq.
[3:21:42.520 --> 3:21:44.520]  Who was saying the opposite?
[3:21:44.520 --> 3:21:46.520]  Who was saying no?
[3:21:46.520 --> 3:21:49.520]  Yet another intervention in the Middle East or North Africa
[3:21:49.520 --> 3:21:51.520]  is going to be an absolute disaster.
[3:21:51.520 --> 3:21:53.520]  Gaddafi's warned us.
[3:21:53.520 --> 3:21:55.520]  In fact, let's throw up one of these headlines right now.
[3:21:55.520 --> 3:21:58.520]  ISIS threatens to send 500,000 migrants to Europe
[3:21:58.520 --> 3:22:01.520]  as a psychological weapon in chilling echo
[3:22:01.520 --> 3:22:04.520]  of Gaddafi's prophecy that the Mediterranean
[3:22:04.520 --> 3:22:07.520]  will become a sea of chaos.
[3:22:07.520 --> 3:22:09.520]  Now he said this before the invasion.
[3:22:09.520 --> 3:22:11.520]  Let's look at another headline.
[3:22:11.520 --> 3:22:14.520]  Out of the Guardian, Gaddafi warned Blair
[3:22:14.520 --> 3:22:17.520]  that his ousting would open door to jihadists.
[3:22:17.520 --> 3:22:21.520]  Transcripts of 2011 call revealed Libyan dictator predicted
[3:22:21.520 --> 3:22:25.520]  extremists would use his departure to start war in Mediterranean.
[3:22:25.520 --> 3:22:27.520]  So he was warning us.
[3:22:27.520 --> 3:22:29.520]  Informals.com was warning everyone,
[3:22:29.520 --> 3:22:32.520]  don't set sail on another ridiculous,
[3:22:32.520 --> 3:22:36.520]  absurd, dangerous invasion of a foreign country
[3:22:36.520 --> 3:22:39.520]  which destabilized the region
[3:22:39.520 --> 3:22:42.520]  and led to exactly what we predicted it would lead to.
[3:22:42.520 --> 3:22:45.520]  You know, we're not just talking about the attack on Manchester.
[3:22:45.520 --> 3:22:48.520]  There's also been numerous other attacks in Europe.
[3:22:48.520 --> 3:22:52.520]  The Paris massacre, they exploited the migrant wave,
[3:22:52.520 --> 3:22:55.520]  the refugee wave in that instance to fake their passports
[3:22:55.520 --> 3:22:57.520]  and get through border controls.
[3:22:57.520 --> 3:23:00.520]  So it all happened exactly as we said it would happen.
[3:23:00.520 --> 3:23:03.520]  CNN said, don't worry everybody, it's going to be fine.
[3:23:03.520 --> 3:23:06.520]  Who was pining out the fake news then, CNN?
[3:23:06.520 --> 3:23:10.520]  Who puts out the most harmful fake news on a routine basis?
[3:23:10.520 --> 3:23:13.520]  Let's look at another example right now.
[3:23:13.520 --> 3:23:16.520]  This is up on Informals.com.
[3:23:16.520 --> 3:23:20.520]  CNN slammed for championing hijab wearing Barbie.
[3:23:20.520 --> 3:23:22.520]  Yes, the hijab wearing Barbie is back again.
[3:23:22.520 --> 3:23:25.520]  Fake news network, CNN promoted a peace championing
[3:23:25.520 --> 3:23:28.520]  toy maker Mattel's new hijab wearing Barbie doll Monday.
[3:23:28.520 --> 3:23:31.520]  It did not go down well with Americans.
[3:23:31.520 --> 3:23:34.520]  The doll which was first seen last year is now in stores
[3:23:34.520 --> 3:23:37.520]  as part of Mattel's shero line of toys.
[3:23:37.520 --> 3:23:40.520]  Yeah, I'll tell you who the real sheroes are.
[3:23:40.520 --> 3:23:43.520]  The women who go to jail, the women who are tortured
[3:23:43.520 --> 3:23:46.520]  in prison in Iran, in Indonesia, in these other Muslim
[3:23:46.520 --> 3:23:49.520]  countries for removing the veil.
[3:23:49.520 --> 3:23:52.520]  They're the real sheroes, CNN.
[3:23:52.520 --> 3:23:55.520]  Yet CNN reveled in promoting the toy, calling it a broader
[3:23:55.520 --> 3:23:58.520]  effort by Mattel to diversify the Barbie lane.
[3:23:58.520 --> 3:24:01.520]  And they also published a written article by Olympic
[3:24:01.520 --> 3:24:07.520]  leader Ibrahim Mohammed, who is Linda Sarsour in Iliatad,
[3:24:07.520 --> 3:24:11.520]  the Olympic athlete, in which he talked about how
[3:24:11.520 --> 3:24:14.520]  great the doll was, how great the hijab is, slammed the
[3:24:14.520 --> 3:24:16.520]  Trump administration.
[3:24:16.520 --> 3:24:19.520]  So CNN gave a platform to this individual to tell
[3:24:19.520 --> 3:24:21.520]  everyone how great the hijab is.
[3:24:21.520 --> 3:24:25.520]  Again, this is CNN pushing actual harmful fake news,
[3:24:25.520 --> 3:24:28.520]  which puts women at risk of torture and imprisonment.
[3:24:28.520 --> 3:24:31.520]  They're creating a narrative that the hijab is a symbol
[3:24:31.520 --> 3:24:34.520]  of women's empowerment, which it isn't.
[3:24:34.520 --> 3:24:35.520]  That is fake news.
[3:24:35.520 --> 3:24:39.520]  That is putting people at actual risk.
[3:24:39.520 --> 3:24:40.520]  People in Iran.
[3:24:40.520 --> 3:24:41.520]  In fact, there was an article.
[3:24:41.520 --> 3:24:45.520]  Iranian anti-hijab female protester jailed for two years.
[3:24:45.520 --> 3:24:48.520]  A brave anti-hijab activist in Iran who protested
[3:24:48.520 --> 3:24:51.520]  against the mandatory wearing of the Islamic headscarf
[3:24:51.520 --> 3:24:54.520]  has been sentenced to two years in prison.
[3:24:54.520 --> 3:24:55.520]  That was earlier this year.
[3:24:55.520 --> 3:24:59.520]  No, CNN says it's great. Everybody should wear it.
[3:24:59.520 --> 3:25:01.520]  And again, I've done videos about this.
[3:25:01.520 --> 3:25:05.520]  The very first Arab feminist group from over 100 years ago,
[3:25:05.520 --> 3:25:07.520]  the Egyptian feminist union.
[3:25:07.520 --> 3:25:10.520]  This was an Arab feminist group in Egypt.
[3:25:10.520 --> 3:25:15.520]  They made removing the veil, the symbol of their entire campaign.
[3:25:15.520 --> 3:25:18.520]  They wanted to get female university education.
[3:25:18.520 --> 3:25:20.520]  It was banned at the time.
[3:25:20.520 --> 3:25:23.520]  They were ultimately successful decades later,
[3:25:23.520 --> 3:25:26.520]  but at the very inception of their movement,
[3:25:26.520 --> 3:25:30.520]  they made removing the veil the symbol of women's empowerment.
[3:25:30.520 --> 3:25:34.520]  Wearing the veil is not a symbol of women's empowerment, CNN.
[3:25:34.520 --> 3:25:36.520]  This is actually harmful.
[3:25:36.520 --> 3:25:39.520]  This crap that you're putting out on a regular basis.
[3:25:39.520 --> 3:25:43.520]  Let's look at what a Muslim reformist said about this.
[3:25:43.520 --> 3:25:44.520]  Let's pull up this article.
[3:25:44.520 --> 3:25:46.520]  This is out of the New York Times.
[3:25:46.520 --> 3:25:49.520]  They actually gave someone a platform to make a common sense argument.
[3:25:49.520 --> 3:25:53.520]  Wearing the hijab in solidarity perpetuates oppression
[3:25:53.520 --> 3:25:56.520]  by Azra Naimani, a Muslim reformist.
[3:25:56.520 --> 3:25:57.520]  She said, quote,
[3:25:57.520 --> 3:26:01.520]  The purity culture covers, segregates, subordinates,
[3:26:01.520 --> 3:26:05.520]  silences, jails and kills women and girls around the world.
[3:26:05.520 --> 3:26:07.520]  She gives several examples.
[3:26:07.520 --> 3:26:10.520]  In India, a father killed his daughter, four years old,
[3:26:10.520 --> 3:26:12.520]  smashing her head against the floor
[3:26:12.520 --> 3:26:14.520]  when her scarf slipped from her head during dinner.
[3:26:14.520 --> 3:26:16.520]  In Ontario, a few years ago,
[3:26:16.520 --> 3:26:18.520]  a man strangled his 16-year-old sister
[3:26:18.520 --> 3:26:21.520]  when she defied their father in November.
[3:26:21.520 --> 3:26:23.520]  This is a couple of years ago now.
[3:26:23.520 --> 3:26:25.520]  A former University of Missouri instructor
[3:26:25.520 --> 3:26:29.520]  dragged a female relative 14 years old out of school
[3:26:29.520 --> 3:26:33.520]  by the hair when he discovered she hadn't covered her hair.
[3:26:33.520 --> 3:26:36.520]  So again, people in and around are going to prison for this.
[3:26:36.520 --> 3:26:38.520]  Young girls as young as four years old
[3:26:38.520 --> 3:26:41.520]  are being killed for not wearing the hijab,
[3:26:41.520 --> 3:26:43.520]  for accidentally letting it slip from their head.
[3:26:43.520 --> 3:26:46.520]  Oh, but CNN says it's a symbol of women's empowerment.
[3:26:46.520 --> 3:26:49.520]  No, it isn't. That's fake news.
[3:26:49.520 --> 3:26:53.520]  Listen to actual Muslims risking their lives on the streets
[3:26:53.520 --> 3:26:55.520]  to protest against this.
[3:26:55.520 --> 3:26:58.520]  Watch videos of the Sharia police
[3:26:58.520 --> 3:27:01.520]  in Indonesia patrolling the streets,
[3:27:01.520 --> 3:27:05.520]  whipping women who don't have their headscarf just right.
[3:27:05.520 --> 3:27:08.520]  Okay, that's the reality of the hijab, CNN.
[3:27:08.520 --> 3:27:11.520]  Look at ISIS-controlled areas in Syria.
[3:27:11.520 --> 3:27:14.520]  As soon as the ISIS fighters,
[3:27:14.520 --> 3:27:16.520]  the Jihadist militants are kicked out of the area,
[3:27:16.520 --> 3:27:18.520]  they film the women. What do the women do?
[3:27:18.520 --> 3:27:21.520]  Remove their hijabs, burn them,
[3:27:21.520 --> 3:27:24.520]  scream and holler in celebration.
[3:27:24.520 --> 3:27:27.520]  Okay, this is all in the videos I made about the hijab.
[3:27:27.520 --> 3:27:29.520]  Go on my YouTube channel, Search Hijab.
[3:27:29.520 --> 3:27:32.520]  It's all there. You can watch it all for yourselves.
[3:27:32.520 --> 3:27:35.520]  So this is not a symbol of feminism, CNN.
[3:27:35.520 --> 3:27:38.520]  This is not a symbol of women's empowerment.
[3:27:38.520 --> 3:27:41.520]  In Sweden, in these migrant-dominated areas,
[3:27:41.520 --> 3:27:44.520]  some shops are now refusing service to women
[3:27:44.520 --> 3:27:46.520]  who don't wear hijabs, okay?
[3:27:46.520 --> 3:27:49.520]  It's not a symbol of female empowerment,
[3:27:49.520 --> 3:27:53.520]  yet CNN gives a platform to Linda Sarsour and Elyatard,
[3:27:53.520 --> 3:27:56.520]  this Olympic athlete, to say how great it is.
[3:27:56.520 --> 3:27:59.520]  And who created the first hijab, Barbie?
[3:27:59.520 --> 3:28:01.520]  It was some left-wing feminist,
[3:28:01.520 --> 3:28:03.520]  I think in Seattle or Portland,
[3:28:03.520 --> 3:28:05.520]  that then got media attention for it.
[3:28:05.520 --> 3:28:08.520]  So it's the media attention that normalizes this,
[3:28:08.520 --> 3:28:12.520]  led to Mattel creating it in the interest of diversity.
[3:28:12.520 --> 3:28:16.520]  No, it's the ultimate patriarchal, not just symbol.
[3:28:16.520 --> 3:28:18.520]  It's a tool of oppression.
[3:28:18.520 --> 3:28:21.520]  It's used to oppress women across the Middle East,
[3:28:21.520 --> 3:28:23.520]  across North Africa.
[3:28:23.520 --> 3:28:26.520]  And CNN saying that it's a symbol of women's empowerment,
[3:28:26.520 --> 3:28:29.520]  giving people platforms to promote it as normal
[3:28:29.520 --> 3:28:31.520]  and something to be encouraged.
[3:28:31.520 --> 3:28:33.520]  That is fake news. That is harmful.
[3:28:33.520 --> 3:28:36.520]  You're disgracing the brave actions of all these women
[3:28:36.520 --> 3:28:38.520]  around, throughout these other countries,
[3:28:38.520 --> 3:28:40.520]  risking their freedom, their livelihood,
[3:28:40.520 --> 3:28:43.520]  in many cases, their lives, to stand up and say,
[3:28:43.520 --> 3:28:45.520]  no, this isn't women's empowerment.
[3:28:45.520 --> 3:28:47.520]  This is a tool of oppression where real feminists
[3:28:47.520 --> 3:28:52.520]  wear standing against it in the face of CNN's fake news.
[3:28:52.520 --> 3:28:54.520]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[3:28:54.520 --> 3:28:56.520]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure,
[3:28:56.520 --> 3:28:59.520]  and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you,
[3:28:59.520 --> 3:29:01.520]  but the symptoms are there.
[3:29:01.520 --> 3:29:04.520]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops,
[3:29:04.520 --> 3:29:06.520]  or circulation and irregular heartbeat
[3:29:06.520 --> 3:29:08.520]  are just a few of these that can alert you
[3:29:08.520 --> 3:29:10.520]  that something is wrong.
[3:29:10.520 --> 3:29:13.520]  Here, how heart and body extract is making a difference
[3:29:13.520 --> 3:29:16.520]  in thousands of people's lives across America.

[3:33:29.520 --> 3:33:32.520]  that gets triggered when you buy these products
[3:33:32.520 --> 3:33:34.520]  is just completely off the charts.
[3:33:34.520 --> 3:33:37.520]  It's just unmentionable, unmeasurable,
[3:33:37.520 --> 3:33:40.520]  the amount of butthurt that CNN experiences
[3:33:40.520 --> 3:33:42.520]  when you buy these products,
[3:33:42.520 --> 3:33:45.520]  because they can't get to us with the ad boycotts.
[3:33:45.520 --> 3:33:47.520]  They've tried, they can't do it,
[3:33:47.520 --> 3:33:50.520]  and we're not dependent on you getting the products.

[3:34:43.520 --> 3:34:46.520]  we may find ourselves taking shelter in the AC.
[3:34:46.520 --> 3:34:48.520]  While it provides some comfort,
[3:34:48.520 --> 3:34:51.520]  that also means we're missing out on the essential sunshine
[3:34:51.520 --> 3:34:53.520]  and vitamins we need daily,
[3:34:53.520 --> 3:34:55.520]  and we've got winter sun right now

[3:35:16.520 --> 3:35:18.520]  It's very highly concentrated.
[3:35:18.520 --> 3:35:23.520]  Look at those reviews, 693 reviews.
[3:35:23.520 --> 3:35:25.520]  We've got a 4.9 on that.
[3:35:25.520 --> 3:35:27.520]  You don't even get that on Amazon.
[3:35:27.520 --> 3:35:30.520]  98% of respondents would recommend this to a friend.
[3:35:30.520 --> 3:35:32.520]  They're all independent third party reviews
[3:35:32.520 --> 3:35:34.520]  from people who've got the product,

[3:35:46.520 --> 3:35:48.520]  So why not get it from us?
[3:35:48.520 --> 3:35:51.520]  Why not get it from us with a massive 40% discount?
[3:35:51.520 --> 3:35:53.520]  And why not enjoy the butthurt,
[3:35:53.520 --> 3:35:57.520]  the sheer relentless butthurt that causes CNN
[3:35:57.520 --> 3:36:02.520]  by getting winter sun for 40% off at InfowarsStore.com.
[3:36:02.520 --> 3:36:06.520]  Please support this network today.
[3:36:06.520 --> 3:36:09.520]  I'm going to get into more of the migrant stuff
[3:36:09.520 --> 3:36:11.520]  in the next segment because, of course,
[3:36:11.520 --> 3:36:13.520]  Spain has become the epicenter of that.
[3:36:13.520 --> 3:36:15.520]  We see the videos coming out of Spain,
[3:36:15.520 --> 3:36:17.520]  the boats invading the beach.
[3:36:17.520 --> 3:36:18.520]  Alex has talked about it today.
[3:36:18.520 --> 3:36:21.520]  There's new news on that, which I'm going to get into.
[3:36:21.520 --> 3:36:24.520]  Let's talk about Twitter because, obviously,
[3:36:24.520 --> 3:36:27.520]  today we had a story up on Infowars.com.
[3:36:27.520 --> 3:36:29.520]  Twitter suspends GOP Senate candidate
[3:36:29.520 --> 3:36:32.520]  for defending himself against Russian agent claims.
[3:36:32.520 --> 3:36:34.520]  This was Austin Peterson,
[3:36:34.520 --> 3:36:36.520]  a candidate in the Republican Party's primary
[3:36:36.520 --> 3:36:38.520]  for US Senate race in Missouri.
[3:36:38.520 --> 3:36:42.520]  He got into an exchange with basically a blue tick leftist
[3:36:42.520 --> 3:36:46.520]  called Caroline Oh, who didn't even dare to give a full name,
[3:36:46.520 --> 3:36:49.520]  of Share Blue Media or Sharia Blue Media,
[3:36:49.520 --> 3:36:51.520]  as some people call it.
[3:36:51.520 --> 3:36:54.520]  So basically, she got triggered by Peterson tweeting,
[3:36:54.520 --> 3:36:57.520]  quote, our campaign accepts Bitcoin contributions.
[3:36:57.520 --> 3:37:00.520]  Then she went on a rant about how accepting Bitcoin
[3:37:00.520 --> 3:37:02.520]  must mean that you're a Russian agent
[3:37:02.520 --> 3:37:04.520]  because all these people are fevered hysterics
[3:37:04.520 --> 3:37:08.520]  and they think literally everything is a Russian box.
[3:37:08.520 --> 3:37:10.520]  She said, interesting timing here.
[3:37:10.520 --> 3:37:13.520]  Russian hackers targeted Claire McGaskill in August 2017.
[3:37:13.520 --> 3:37:16.520]  The next month, one of her GOP opponents in Missouri
[3:37:16.520 --> 3:37:18.520]  rolled out this new ad.
[3:37:18.520 --> 3:37:19.520]  Wasn't even an ad.
[3:37:19.520 --> 3:37:21.520]  It was just asking for Bitcoin donations.
[3:37:21.520 --> 3:37:26.520]  So Peterson responded by tweeting a GIF image,
[3:37:26.520 --> 3:37:28.520]  which was within Twitter's own GIF selection.
[3:37:28.520 --> 3:37:31.520]  He didn't even pull it from the internet or create it.
[3:37:31.520 --> 3:37:35.520]  Of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin with the words,
[3:37:35.520 --> 3:37:39.520]  off to the gulag, which is obviously a satirical joke
[3:37:39.520 --> 3:37:43.520]  based around the premise that if he was in with the Russians,
[3:37:43.520 --> 3:37:46.520]  he would have the power to send her off to the gulag.
[3:37:46.520 --> 3:37:47.520]  It's a joke.
[3:37:47.520 --> 3:37:50.520]  I'm sorry, you can only make jokes on Twitter
[3:37:50.520 --> 3:37:53.520]  if you're talking about molesting children like James Gunn.
[3:37:53.520 --> 3:37:55.520]  Then it's acceptable.
[3:37:55.520 --> 3:37:57.520]  Then everyone rallies to your defense.
[3:37:57.520 --> 3:38:00.520]  You make a political joke based on something that happened,
[3:38:00.520 --> 3:38:02.520]  nearly 100 years ago.
[3:38:02.520 --> 3:38:03.520]  No, banned.
[3:38:03.520 --> 3:38:07.520]  12 hours suspension because the tweet was mass reported.
[3:38:07.520 --> 3:38:10.520]  So he had to log in, delete the tweet.
[3:38:10.520 --> 3:38:14.520]  He was still suspended for 12 hours at the key critical moment
[3:38:14.520 --> 3:38:17.520]  of this primary race.
[3:38:17.520 --> 3:38:18.520]  So this is Twitter.
[3:38:18.520 --> 3:38:20.520]  This is what he accused them of.
[3:38:20.520 --> 3:38:24.520]  He accused Twitter and Democratic-aligned super PACs
[3:38:24.520 --> 3:38:27.520]  of interfering with the federal Senate race in Missouri
[3:38:27.520 --> 3:38:30.520]  by temporarily blocking his words,
[3:38:30.520 --> 3:38:32.520]  my account due to a picture I shared,
[3:38:32.520 --> 3:38:36.520]  which was located within Twitter's own GIF file collection.
[3:38:36.520 --> 3:38:39.520]  So he was suspended at a critical moment
[3:38:39.520 --> 3:38:42.520]  simply because a satirical political joke
[3:38:42.520 --> 3:38:46.520]  based around Stalin's gulags was mass reported
[3:38:46.520 --> 3:38:48.520]  by hysterical far leftists.
[3:38:48.520 --> 3:38:52.520]  And he was gone for 12 hours during that critical juncture.
[3:38:52.520 --> 3:38:56.520]  So is that Twitter interfering in an election?
[3:38:56.520 --> 3:39:00.520]  Everybody has hysterical fever dreams about Russian bots
[3:39:00.520 --> 3:39:02.520]  interfering with everything on Twitter,
[3:39:02.520 --> 3:39:04.520]  even though there's no evidence to back it up
[3:39:04.520 --> 3:39:07.520]  that they're having any kind of massive impact.
[3:39:07.520 --> 3:39:09.520]  Twitter interferes.
[3:39:09.520 --> 3:39:10.520]  Nobody says a word.
[3:39:10.520 --> 3:39:13.520]  You can only joke about molesting children on Twitter.
[3:39:13.520 --> 3:39:14.520]  That's fine.
[3:39:14.520 --> 3:39:17.520]  So long as you're left-wing, that's completely fine.
[3:39:17.520 --> 3:39:20.520]  Oh, the other thing as well on this, misogyny.
[3:39:20.520 --> 3:39:23.520]  We always hear on Twitter about the scourge,
[3:39:23.520 --> 3:39:27.520]  the plague of hateful misogyny from the right-wing against women.
[3:39:27.520 --> 3:39:29.520]  Well, here's a headline.
[3:39:29.520 --> 3:39:32.520]  Neutral platform Twitter shrugs as verified account
[3:39:32.520 --> 3:39:35.520]  calls Melania Trump whole-bag hucker.
[3:39:35.520 --> 3:39:38.520]  So it's okay to be hateful and misogynistic towards women
[3:39:38.520 --> 3:39:41.520]  so long as the target is a conservative
[3:39:41.520 --> 3:39:43.520]  or is the wife of Donald Trump.
[3:39:43.520 --> 3:39:44.520]  Then it's fine.
[3:39:44.520 --> 3:39:47.520]  Again, it's okay when we do it.
[3:39:47.520 --> 3:39:49.520]  That's their whole mantra.
[3:39:49.520 --> 3:39:51.520]  It's okay when we do it.
[3:39:51.520 --> 3:39:54.520]  Well, point the finger all day long at anyone
[3:39:54.520 --> 3:39:56.520]  for criticizing a woman.
[3:39:56.520 --> 3:39:58.520]  I mean, you criticize a feminist on Twitter.
[3:39:58.520 --> 3:40:01.520]  The White Knights come running and accuse you of misogyny
[3:40:01.520 --> 3:40:04.520]  for humiliating her for her dumb opinion.
[3:40:04.520 --> 3:40:06.520]  But this guy, Mark Roberts,
[3:40:06.520 --> 3:40:09.520]  the congressional candidate in Oregon, suggested Monday
[3:40:09.520 --> 3:40:13.520]  that First Lady Melania Trump is a sex worker.
[3:40:13.520 --> 3:40:15.520]  Remember what they said about Barron Trump,
[3:40:15.520 --> 3:40:18.520]  the actor Peter Fonda?
[3:40:18.520 --> 3:40:22.520]  Again, openly encouraging inciting him to be molested.
[3:40:22.520 --> 3:40:23.520]  That's fine.
[3:40:23.520 --> 3:40:24.520]  It wasn't even a joke.
[3:40:24.520 --> 3:40:25.520]  That's fine.
[3:40:25.520 --> 3:40:27.520]  He calls Melania Trump a sex worker.
[3:40:27.520 --> 3:40:29.520]  The post went mega viral on Twitter.
[3:40:29.520 --> 3:40:32.520]  The Silicon Valley Company's inaction provides a clear view
[3:40:32.520 --> 3:40:35.520]  of how its hate speech rules are selectively enforced
[3:40:35.520 --> 3:40:38.520]  only against conservatives and populists.
[3:40:38.520 --> 3:40:41.520]  And again, to be clear, they see Peter Fonda
[3:40:41.520 --> 3:40:43.520]  from about a month back with his pedophile tweets.
[3:40:43.520 --> 3:40:45.520]  Nothing happened to him.
[3:40:45.520 --> 3:40:48.520]  He's openly encouraging people to go to schools
[3:40:48.520 --> 3:40:52.520]  where ICE agents have kids and harass the kids.
[3:40:52.520 --> 3:40:53.520]  Okay.
[3:40:53.520 --> 3:40:57.520]  You can call for the harassment of children on Twitter.
[3:40:57.520 --> 3:41:00.520]  You can call for the molestation of children on Twitter.
[3:41:00.520 --> 3:41:03.520]  If you're a bluetick leftist, nothing happens.
[3:41:03.520 --> 3:41:05.520]  Nothing happened to his account.
[3:41:05.520 --> 3:41:06.520]  Didn't even get suspended.
[3:41:06.520 --> 3:41:09.520]  If you tweet a gif joke based on Joseph Stalin
[3:41:09.520 --> 3:41:12.520]  at the height of a key Senate race,
[3:41:12.520 --> 3:41:14.520]  suspended for 12 hours.
[3:41:14.520 --> 3:41:16.520]  And he's probably lucky he hasn't been banned by now.
[3:41:16.520 --> 3:41:20.520]  This is the double standard that pisses people off.
[3:41:20.520 --> 3:41:22.520]  So this guy, Mark Roberts,
[3:41:22.520 --> 3:41:25.520]  basically called Melania Trump a prostitute.
[3:41:25.520 --> 3:41:26.520]  Nobody cares.
[3:41:26.520 --> 3:41:27.520]  Nothing happened to him.
[3:41:27.520 --> 3:41:31.520]  But God forbid you challenged the opinion of Amy Schumer
[3:41:31.520 --> 3:41:32.520]  or Chelsea Handler.
[3:41:32.520 --> 3:41:34.520]  You're an evil misogynist.
[3:41:34.520 --> 3:41:36.520]  And of course, this is what we've covered before.
[3:41:36.520 --> 3:41:38.520]  Who's running the new hate speech system
[3:41:38.520 --> 3:41:40.520]  which Twitter seeks to introduce?
[3:41:40.520 --> 3:41:43.520]  It's a hysterical far leftist
[3:41:43.520 --> 3:41:47.520]  who's tweeted numerous times about how she hates Donald Trump.
[3:41:47.520 --> 3:41:50.520]  A woman called Dr. Rebecca Trumbull.
[3:41:50.520 --> 3:41:52.520]  I went through her previous tweets last night.
[3:41:52.520 --> 3:41:56.520]  She literally wore a posse hat and attended the Women's March.
[3:41:56.520 --> 3:41:58.520]  This is the woman who now decides
[3:41:58.520 --> 3:42:02.520]  what the algorithm for Twitter denotes his hate speech.
[3:42:02.520 --> 3:42:04.520]  Gee, what could possibly go wrong?
[3:42:04.520 --> 3:42:07.520]  Absolutely incredible.
[3:42:07.520 --> 3:42:10.520]  Meanwhile, Buzzfeed, and she was hired
[3:42:10.520 --> 3:42:13.520]  because Twitter said they had a problem with hate speech,
[3:42:13.520 --> 3:42:16.520]  Buzzfeed comes out with an article and says,
[3:42:16.520 --> 3:42:19.520]  oh, conservatives aren't being shadow banned.
[3:42:19.520 --> 3:42:21.520]  No, it's only content which, quote,
[3:42:21.520 --> 3:42:25.520]  distracts from the conversation that's being shadow banned.
[3:42:25.520 --> 3:42:28.520]  Okay, so who decides what distracts from the conversation?
[3:42:28.520 --> 3:42:32.520]  Oh, this far left pussy hat-wearing Women's March attending
[3:42:32.520 --> 3:42:35.520]  anti-Trump hysterical academic.
[3:42:35.520 --> 3:42:36.520]  Oh, that's fine.
[3:42:36.520 --> 3:42:39.520]  That seems very neutral, very impartial, doesn't it?
[3:42:39.520 --> 3:42:41.520]  Of course, the truth is, that term,
[3:42:41.520 --> 3:42:43.520]  distracting from the conversation,
[3:42:43.520 --> 3:42:45.520]  is completely subjective,
[3:42:45.520 --> 3:42:48.520]  so that's why it is shadow banning.
[3:42:48.520 --> 3:42:50.520]  Absolutely incredible.
[3:42:50.520 --> 3:42:52.520]  We'll be back. It's the Alex Jones Show.
[3:42:52.520 --> 3:42:53.520]  I don't know.
[3:42:53.520 --> 3:42:55.520]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water
[3:42:55.520 --> 3:42:56.520]  is a serious health issue.
[3:42:56.520 --> 3:42:59.520]  Info Wars is proud to sell incredible filters,

[3:45:56.520 --> 3:45:59.520]  for inflammatory support and joint support.
[3:45:59.520 --> 3:46:02.520]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with bodies.
[3:46:02.520 --> 3:46:06.520]  Bodies contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[3:46:06.520 --> 3:46:08.520]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years
[3:46:08.520 --> 3:46:11.520]  and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[3:46:11.520 --> 3:46:15.520]  It is well-known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[3:46:15.520 --> 3:46:18.520]  Our pure turmeric extract, plus peppering from black pepper,
[3:46:18.520 --> 3:46:23.520]  makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility,

[3:46:26.520 --> 3:46:31.520]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients,
[3:46:31.520 --> 3:46:36.520]  but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[3:46:36.520 --> 3:46:42.520]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm,
[3:46:42.520 --> 3:46:45.520]  and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.

[3:47:15.520 --> 3:47:21.520]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:47:45.520 --> 3:47:49.520]  The sources are warning that 50,000 illegal migrants from sub-Saharan Africa
[3:47:49.520 --> 3:47:53.520]  are waiting in Morocco to invade Spain.
[3:47:53.520 --> 3:47:57.520]  Now this is because they've made deals with the people smugglers.
[3:47:57.520 --> 3:48:01.520]  The people smugglers are promising them that Spain is their paradise
[3:48:01.520 --> 3:48:05.520]  and they're all bottlenecked up in Morocco waiting to cross into Spain
[3:48:05.520 --> 3:48:08.520]  because basically Spain just got a new socialist government
[3:48:08.520 --> 3:48:11.520]  which gave them the green light to do so.
[3:48:11.520 --> 3:48:16.520]  Despite all the problems for the past three years that this has caused Europe.
[3:48:16.520 --> 3:48:20.520]  According to a report in Spanish newspaper El Mundo,
[3:48:20.520 --> 3:48:24.520]  North Africa is becoming a pressure cooker with at least 50,000 African migrants
[3:48:24.520 --> 3:48:29.520]  desperate to cross into the European country via the Strait of Gibraltar.
[3:48:29.520 --> 3:48:33.520]  They're saying it's 50,000 right now, that number continues to grow,
[3:48:33.520 --> 3:48:37.520]  these men are becoming more violent in their efforts to reach Europe.
[3:48:37.520 --> 3:48:42.520]  And remember, so far in 2018, these are the official figures,
[3:48:42.520 --> 3:48:45.520]  21,000 arrivals so far in Spain.
[3:48:45.520 --> 3:48:48.520]  That's quickened since the socialist government gave them the green light.
[3:48:48.520 --> 3:48:51.520]  But again, these numbers are wrong.
[3:48:51.520 --> 3:48:54.520]  These numbers are way lower than the actual figure
[3:48:54.520 --> 3:48:58.520]  because the countries are disincentivised from registering migrants.
[3:48:58.520 --> 3:49:01.520]  When the migrants arrive in these different European countries,
[3:49:01.520 --> 3:49:04.520]  there's no incentive to register them
[3:49:04.520 --> 3:49:08.520]  because if EU countries want to deport them under EU law,
[3:49:08.520 --> 3:49:13.520]  they have to deport them to the very first EU member state they arrived in.
[3:49:13.520 --> 3:49:17.520]  So of course, these EU member states don't want all the different migrants
[3:49:17.520 --> 3:49:21.520]  being sent back to their country because some of them are finally
[3:49:21.520 --> 3:49:25.520]  realised that you actually need border controls to have a country.
[3:49:25.520 --> 3:49:27.520]  So they're not registering them.
[3:49:27.520 --> 3:49:30.520]  So these migrants are completely unregistered.
[3:49:30.520 --> 3:49:34.520]  So roaming around, the 21,000 figure is minimal.
[3:49:34.520 --> 3:49:37.520]  It's probably double that, at least, I would imagine.
[3:49:37.520 --> 3:49:40.520]  As Breitbart reported,
[3:49:40.520 --> 3:49:44.520]  the Dutch government has suggested that some two-thirds of illegal migrants
[3:49:44.520 --> 3:49:47.520]  who reach them have not previously been registered.
[3:49:47.520 --> 3:49:50.520]  So it could be as much as three times that number,
[3:49:50.520 --> 3:49:54.520]  suggesting the true migration figures could be far higher.
[3:49:54.520 --> 3:49:58.520]  Now, of course, last week we had 800 sub-Saharan migrants
[3:49:58.520 --> 3:50:02.520]  going to cross the border between Morocco and the Spanish enclave of Sweater,
[3:50:02.520 --> 3:50:07.520]  throwing feces, burning quick lime, stones and Molotov cocktails at police.
[3:50:07.520 --> 3:50:10.520]  Yes, they're actually throwing crap at police,
[3:50:10.520 --> 3:50:16.520]  using sores, using homemade flame throwers to try to get through these flimsy barriers.
[3:50:16.520 --> 3:50:20.520]  600 of them succeeded in crossing the border.
[3:50:20.520 --> 3:50:22.520]  We posted the video of that last week.
[3:50:22.520 --> 3:50:23.520]  They're screaming wildly.
[3:50:23.520 --> 3:50:25.520]  They're running down the streets,
[3:50:25.520 --> 3:50:28.520]  completely in absolute chaos and bedlam.
[3:50:28.520 --> 3:50:30.520]  And it's going to happen over and over again,
[3:50:30.520 --> 3:50:35.520]  not just the beach arrivals, but now 50,000 illegal migrants bottlenecked
[3:50:35.520 --> 3:50:40.520]  between Morocco and Spain waiting to arrive.
[3:50:40.520 --> 3:50:42.520]  And that's just through that one entry port alone.
[3:50:42.520 --> 3:50:44.520]  That's the other entry port.
[3:50:44.520 --> 3:50:49.520]  You see the sea route where they just get on dingies and get ashore
[3:50:49.520 --> 3:50:53.520]  because the criminal people smugglers are conspiring with the NGOs
[3:50:53.520 --> 3:50:56.520]  to have them rescued off the coast of Libya.
[3:50:56.520 --> 3:51:00.520]  These people are not rescued near Spain, near Italy.
[3:51:00.520 --> 3:51:04.520]  They're not drowning, although Italy has halved the drowning deaths.
[3:51:04.520 --> 3:51:09.520]  So again, Italy institutes strong border controls to protect their country,
[3:51:09.520 --> 3:51:11.520]  to protect their culture.
[3:51:11.520 --> 3:51:15.520]  It results in migrant drowning deaths being halved.
[3:51:15.520 --> 3:51:19.520]  Meanwhile, Spain incentivizes the migrants to make that dangerous journey,
[3:51:19.520 --> 3:51:21.520]  which you just saw on the dingy boat there.
[3:51:21.520 --> 3:51:23.520]  More migrants are going to die.
[3:51:23.520 --> 3:51:28.520]  The real humanitarian option is to have actual borders
[3:51:28.520 --> 3:51:31.520]  because it disincentivizes them from coming in the first place.
[3:51:31.520 --> 3:51:33.520]  The people smugglers go out of business
[3:51:33.520 --> 3:51:37.520]  and the brain drain of all these people leaving these African countries
[3:51:37.520 --> 3:51:41.520]  is at least stemmed to a certain extent.
[3:51:41.520 --> 3:51:46.520]  So the true humanitarian policy is to have strong borders.
[3:51:46.520 --> 3:51:50.520]  But still, there are an entire army of left-wing idiots
[3:51:50.520 --> 3:51:52.520]  who don't know any of this.
[3:51:52.520 --> 3:51:55.520]  They just think, oh, I have a heart, I'm a liberal.
[3:51:55.520 --> 3:51:57.520]  Of course we should support refugees,
[3:51:57.520 --> 3:51:59.520]  it's women and children drowning in the sea.
[3:51:59.520 --> 3:52:01.520]  No, it isn't.
[3:52:01.520 --> 3:52:04.520]  The vast majority are fighting aged men,
[3:52:04.520 --> 3:52:07.520]  as you can see in all the videos.
[3:52:07.520 --> 3:52:11.520]  German students empty water bottles on their heads
[3:52:11.520 --> 3:52:13.520]  in protest against drowning refugees.
[3:52:13.520 --> 3:52:16.520]  Again, the height of absolute idiocy.
[3:52:16.520 --> 3:52:20.520]  Students of the Munich Movie School held a protest
[3:52:20.520 --> 3:52:22.520]  against their state's migration policy,
[3:52:22.520 --> 3:52:25.520]  even though Germany's already let in 2 million.
[3:52:25.520 --> 3:52:27.520]  No, not enough, not enough.
[3:52:27.520 --> 3:52:30.520]  Mass assaults, you know, mass sexual assaults at Cologne.
[3:52:30.520 --> 3:52:32.520]  People trying to blow themselves up at music festivals.
[3:52:32.520 --> 3:52:34.520]  No, not enough.
[3:52:34.520 --> 3:52:37.520]  People barreling in trucks through Christmas markets in Berlin.
[3:52:37.520 --> 3:52:39.520]  Not enough, we want more, we want more.
[3:52:39.520 --> 3:52:42.520]  Pathological altruism every single time.
[3:52:42.520 --> 3:52:45.520]  During a visit of the Bavarian Prime Minister to the school,
[3:52:45.520 --> 3:52:48.520]  the students emptied bottles onto their heads
[3:52:48.520 --> 3:52:50.520]  to draw attention to the situation of refugees
[3:52:50.520 --> 3:52:52.520]  in the Mediterranean.
[3:52:52.520 --> 3:52:56.520]  And as you see here, it looks like complete absolute idiocy
[3:52:56.520 --> 3:52:58.520]  from like 14-year-old kids
[3:52:58.520 --> 3:53:01.520]  who don't know anything about the situation,
[3:53:01.520 --> 3:53:03.520]  anything about the specifics.
[3:53:03.520 --> 3:53:06.520]  The Italian government has literally stopped
[3:53:06.520 --> 3:53:08.520]  over a thousand migrants drowning
[3:53:08.520 --> 3:53:11.520]  from having strong border controls.
[3:53:11.520 --> 3:53:13.520]  So if these kids get what they want,
[3:53:13.520 --> 3:53:16.520]  they will ensure that more migrants drown.
[3:53:16.520 --> 3:53:18.520]  Okay, so their protest is going to achieve
[3:53:18.520 --> 3:53:21.520]  the exact opposite of what it is supposed to achieve.
[3:53:21.520 --> 3:53:24.520]  You frigging morons.
[3:53:26.520 --> 3:53:28.520]  Daily Mail reports four French police officers
[3:53:28.520 --> 3:53:30.520]  are seriously injured during a savage ambush
[3:53:30.520 --> 3:53:33.520]  by drunk UK-bound migrants in Calais.
[3:53:33.520 --> 3:53:36.520]  There's still hundreds of people in Calais.
[3:53:36.520 --> 3:53:38.520]  Macron raised the migrant camp.
[3:53:38.520 --> 3:53:40.520]  It did nothing, they just came back
[3:53:40.520 --> 3:53:43.520]  and they went to other areas of France. It's a total mess.
[3:53:43.520 --> 3:53:46.520]  His approval rating is the lowest ever.
[3:53:46.520 --> 3:53:49.520]  Four French police officers have been seriously injured
[3:53:49.520 --> 3:53:53.520]  during a savage ambush by drunk UK-bound migrants in Calais.
[3:53:53.520 --> 3:53:56.520]  One, an officer in a CRS riot control unit,
[3:53:56.520 --> 3:53:58.520]  was particularly badly hurt
[3:53:58.520 --> 3:54:01.520]  after being hit repeatedly around the head with a large stone.
[3:54:01.520 --> 3:54:04.520]  There's a picture of the stone. It's as big as the man's hand.
[3:54:04.520 --> 3:54:06.520]  You see footage out of Calais
[3:54:06.520 --> 3:54:09.520]  where it looks like a literal zombie attack in the night,
[3:54:09.520 --> 3:54:12.520]  where they're just roaming around trees as roadblocks,
[3:54:12.520 --> 3:54:14.520]  branches as roadblocks.
[3:54:14.520 --> 3:54:17.520]  They set things on fire to try and hijack these vans.
[3:54:17.520 --> 3:54:20.520]  In some cases, the vans are being driven by women.
[3:54:20.520 --> 3:54:22.520]  They're threatened with rape.
[3:54:22.520 --> 3:54:24.520]  This is the situation in Calais right now,
[3:54:24.520 --> 3:54:28.520]  and we just had another attack on police officers.
[3:54:28.520 --> 3:54:29.520]  But forget about that.
[3:54:29.520 --> 3:54:32.520]  Let's all just pour bottles of water over our heads
[3:54:32.520 --> 3:54:35.520]  because we're liberal.
[3:54:35.520 --> 3:54:38.520]  It doesn't matter about the fact that people are being raped,
[3:54:38.520 --> 3:54:41.520]  people being assaulted on the streets of Sweden,
[3:54:41.520 --> 3:54:44.520]  Germany, the Netherlands, everywhere you go, no.
[3:54:44.520 --> 3:54:46.520]  We need more. We need more
[3:54:46.520 --> 3:54:49.520]  because it's pathological altruism.
[3:54:49.520 --> 3:54:54.520]  Spain denies mass migration, says Europe needs new blood.
[3:54:54.520 --> 3:54:55.520]  Again, it's not enough.
[3:54:55.520 --> 3:54:58.520]  So again, this is the Spanish foreign minister
[3:54:58.520 --> 3:55:01.520]  claiming that, oh, it's only 21,000 migrants so far.
[3:55:01.520 --> 3:55:03.520]  Well, we've already proven that that's not true.
[3:55:03.520 --> 3:55:05.520]  It's probably 60,000
[3:55:05.520 --> 3:55:09.520]  in the first seven months of 2018 alone.
[3:55:09.520 --> 3:55:10.520]  And he's saying we need new blood
[3:55:10.520 --> 3:55:12.520]  because the population's dying off.
[3:55:12.520 --> 3:55:13.520]  We need workers.
[3:55:13.520 --> 3:55:16.520]  We need people to fund the pension obligations,
[3:55:16.520 --> 3:55:19.520]  even though in virtually every example provided,
[3:55:19.520 --> 3:55:22.520]  migrants go on welfare in Sweden.
[3:55:22.520 --> 3:55:27.520]  It's 58% of welfare recipients are migrants.
[3:55:27.520 --> 3:55:29.520]  Okay, they don't get jobs.
[3:55:29.520 --> 3:55:31.520]  They don't fund the system.
[3:55:31.520 --> 3:55:33.520]  They suck off the system.
[3:55:33.520 --> 3:55:35.520]  That's not what's going on.
[3:55:35.520 --> 3:55:37.520]  People are literally being replaced.
[3:55:37.520 --> 3:55:40.520]  And fine, if you're going to have a decline of population,
[3:55:40.520 --> 3:55:42.520]  you can manage a decline of population
[3:55:42.520 --> 3:55:46.520]  or you can incentivize your population to have babies.
[3:55:46.520 --> 3:55:49.520]  Spain has just spent 30 million euros,
[3:55:49.520 --> 3:55:51.520]  and that's going to rise,
[3:55:51.520 --> 3:55:53.520]  on a plan to deal with all these migrants
[3:55:53.520 --> 3:55:57.520]  that literally thrown crap at border police using flame throwers.
[3:55:57.520 --> 3:55:59.520]  They're literally catering to them,
[3:55:59.520 --> 3:56:01.520]  spending 30 million euros.
[3:56:01.520 --> 3:56:06.520]  Meanwhile, they've still got an unemployment rate of 15% plus.
[3:56:06.520 --> 3:56:10.520]  They've got youth unemployment rate of 33% plus,
[3:56:10.520 --> 3:56:15.520]  and yet they're still spending money on this pathological altruism.
[3:56:15.520 --> 3:56:19.520]  Absolute insanity.
[3:56:19.520 --> 3:56:21.520]  Italian boat returning migrants to Libya
[3:56:21.520 --> 3:56:25.520]  may have broken law, UN agency says.
[3:56:25.520 --> 3:56:29.520]  So the UN has ignored people smugglers working with NGOs
[3:56:29.520 --> 3:56:32.520]  who have actually broken the law for the past three years
[3:56:32.520 --> 3:56:36.520]  by picking these migrants up from Libya as a taxi service,
[3:56:36.520 --> 3:56:38.520]  bringing them to Europe.
[3:56:38.520 --> 3:56:40.520]  Then half of them just disappear.
[3:56:40.520 --> 3:56:41.520]  They're not even registered.
[3:56:41.520 --> 3:56:42.520]  They've broken the law.
[3:56:42.520 --> 3:56:44.520]  They did nothing about that.
[3:56:44.520 --> 3:56:46.520]  They said nothing about that.
[3:56:46.520 --> 3:56:49.520]  Oh, but now Italy, because it actually has border controls now,
[3:56:49.520 --> 3:56:51.520]  thank God for Salvini,
[3:56:51.520 --> 3:56:54.520]  picks these migrants up, saves their lives,
[3:56:54.520 --> 3:56:56.520]  returns them to Libya.
[3:56:56.520 --> 3:56:58.520]  We're not being thanked, by the way.
[3:56:58.520 --> 3:57:00.520]  We saw a story a couple of weeks ago
[3:57:00.520 --> 3:57:03.520]  where they saved these migrants from a dinghy,
[3:57:03.520 --> 3:57:06.520]  and then the migrants threatened to kill the people
[3:57:06.520 --> 3:57:08.520]  who saved them on the boat,
[3:57:08.520 --> 3:57:12.520]  because they knew they were being sent back to Libya.
[3:57:12.520 --> 3:57:14.520]  That's breaking the law, says the UN,
[3:57:14.520 --> 3:57:17.520]  actually coordinating with criminal people smugglers
[3:57:17.520 --> 3:57:21.520]  who have incentivized the drowning of thousands of people
[3:57:21.520 --> 3:57:24.520]  through these Soros-backed NGOs.
[3:57:24.520 --> 3:57:26.520]  That's perfectly fine.
[3:57:26.520 --> 3:57:29.520]  That's a completely incredible situation.
[3:57:29.520 --> 3:57:31.520]  That's going to wrap it up for the show.
[3:57:31.520 --> 3:57:33.520]  War Room with Owen Shroyer is coming up.
[3:57:33.520 --> 3:57:35.520]  Breaking news at Infowars.com.
[3:57:35.520 --> 3:57:36.520]  Don't go away.
[3:57:43.520 --> 3:57:46.520]  Patrick N, the great nation of Australia.
[3:57:46.520 --> 3:57:48.520]  You're on the air worldwide.
[3:57:48.520 --> 3:57:49.520]  Thanks for holding.
[3:57:49.520 --> 3:57:50.520]  Hey, Alex, mate.
[3:57:50.520 --> 3:57:52.520]  I've been following you since I was 14,
[3:57:52.520 --> 3:57:54.520]  and I'm 32 now.
[3:57:54.520 --> 3:57:56.520]  Back when Infowars and Prison Planet,
[3:57:56.520 --> 3:57:58.520]  it was just blue text on a white screen,
[3:57:58.520 --> 3:58:01.520]  and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet,
[3:58:01.520 --> 3:58:03.520]  and I thought it was pretty cool.
[3:58:03.520 --> 3:58:05.520]  I've read all the books and seen all the DVDs
[3:58:05.520 --> 3:58:07.520]  and followed all your guests,
[3:58:07.520 --> 3:58:09.520]  and I've been using your products since the first iteration
[3:58:09.520 --> 3:58:12.520]  of Survival Shield, and since then, I'm on the X2,
[3:58:12.520 --> 3:58:16.520]  the SuperMail Vitality Decay Man, the Real Red Pill,
[3:58:16.520 --> 3:58:18.520]  micro-ZX biting, it's all amazing.
[3:58:18.520 --> 3:58:19.520]  Thank you, brother.
[3:58:19.520 --> 3:58:22.520]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much,
[3:58:22.520 --> 3:58:24.520]  it's like you're just detoxing the mind,
[3:58:24.520 --> 3:58:27.520]  you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit,
[3:58:27.520 --> 3:58:29.520]  and it's just the more you know God,
[3:58:29.520 --> 3:58:32.520]  the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[3:58:32.520 --> 3:58:35.520]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side
[3:58:35.520 --> 3:58:37.520]  with you, the crew, and the listeners out there,
[3:58:37.520 --> 3:58:53.520]  1776 World War.
[3:59:08.520 --> 3:59:10.520]  You are the Info War.
[3:59:10.520 --> 3:59:12.520]  And now because of their intensifying censorship,
[3:59:12.520 --> 3:59:14.520]  it's more important than ever
[3:59:14.520 --> 3:59:17.520]  that everyone go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter
[3:59:17.520 --> 3:59:20.520]  and sign up via email so there's no way the censors
[3:59:20.520 --> 3:59:23.520]  can get between us with critical videos, articles,
[3:59:23.520 --> 3:59:25.520]  breaking news, intel, you name it.
[3:59:25.520 --> 3:59:27.520]  And so now I ask you more than ever
[3:59:27.520 --> 3:59:30.520]  to share the infowars.com articles, to share the videos,
[3:59:30.520 --> 3:59:33.520]  to tell people by the local stations you're listening to,
[3:59:33.520 --> 3:59:35.520]  but the bare minimum you can do is sign up
[3:59:35.520 --> 3:59:40.520]  for the free newsletter at infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[3:59:40.520 --> 4:00:06.520]  We are the Renaissance, and we are winning.
